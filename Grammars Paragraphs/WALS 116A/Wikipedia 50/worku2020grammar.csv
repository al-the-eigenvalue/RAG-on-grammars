"12.5 Polar questions
The term polar question is a more appropriate label than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ question (Dixon
2012: 377). As Dixon argues, some languages may lack words ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in their
lexicon and Mursi is one of them. Instead Mursi utilizes default interjections, negative
particle word/particle or copula verbs ― see the examples given in (12.43a-c).

Like in interrogative words, in polar questions, a constituent which is the focus takes
sentence-final position. In other words, it is the constituent with a raised intonation that
is expected to take the focus position and this could be by moving the constituent to the
right most slot of the clause ―for example kíɲáŋ in (12.43a). In polar questions, if the
sentence involves copula verb, obviously the copula complement will be a constituent
upon which a high pitch rests, as in (12.43c).

studentIn almost all cases, the syntactic order of constituents of declarative sentence and polar
questions are exactly the same. The English equivalents to the Mursi interjections in
above examples will be ɪmm ‘no’ and ɪɲɲ ‘yes’. It is quite common for interjections to
have a different phonology. For instance, both of these interjections contain a short
central vowel which is not part of the sound system of the language and may have a
monosyllabic VCG shape (where G stands for geminates).
When a intransitive clause is set to indicate a polar questions, it is on the intransitive
verb that the high pitch level can be shown, ― otherwise the verb remains high-toned
in most cases.

Positive declarative sentences are not the only syntactic structures that have identical
order of constituents with polar questions, negative declarative sentences have also
identical order. Thus in negative polar interrogative and negative declarative sentences,
the verb is placed in focus position at the end of the sentence, as in (12.45a-b).

The fact that both positive and negative polar interrogatives are equivalent in a way
they cause their propositions to generate answers. Both positive polar interrogatives
(12.43-12.44) and negative polar interrogatives can have either yes or no answers.","[552, 553, 554]"

The inherently negative lexeme ímág ‘(I) don’t know, be ignorant of’ can function as
negative predicate and occur with or without first person prefix. But it always takes
bound pronominal subject suffixes.

A k(V)- prefix for first persons and independent personal pronouns for all other nonfirst persons may be employed in S function. Yet the morphology of this negative
lexeme is very odd and does not have consistency; it even resembles verbs which have
irregular inflectional nature. Despite its morphology, the inherently negative verb imag
behaves the same way as negated verbs; it usually takes clause-final position. When it
is being passivized, it will have a meaning ‘unknown, not known’, as in (13.34).

13.6 Indefinite-like words
Mursi lacks independent negative indefinite words in its negation constructions. Not
only in Mursi but also across world’s languages, negative indefinite words are rare (cf.
Dixon 2012: 121). However, this doesn’t mean that they don’t exist along other negator
particles. For instance, Mursi has two indefinite-like words: àhìtí ~ [àhì-ti] <thing.SGINDEF:NRSTR> ‘thing’ and hírkóna ~ [hír-kón-a] <person-one-INDEF:RSTR> ‘someone,a certain person, anybody’. When they are being used with the negative existential
lexeme níŋɛ̀, they may convey negative indefinite meanings ‘nothing’ and ‘nobody’
respectively. The negative existential níŋɛ̀ can potentially occur anywhere, but usually
in its typical clause-final position.

In (13.36b), the third person pronoun in the complement clause can be an optional
element as long as the argument is cross-referenced on the verb. Thus it doesn't cause
a difference in meaning if deleted.

The suffix -a is a restrictive/indefinite nominalizer at phrase level. Without -a hirkon means ‘twenty’

92555In contrast, the indefinite pronoun hírkóná in (13.37b) can appear without the negative
existential níŋɛ̀ whose meaning would mean ‘anybody’.

One without the negative existential word has been found ― hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j ~ <person.SG
INDEF one> ‘no one’ (Lit. a certain person). Literally, both hírkóná and hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j wouldmean ‘one/(a certain)person. However, there is one major distinction between the two,
i.e. hírkóná is a compound word indefinite pronoun derived from the indefinite generic
noun hírí ‘man’ and from indefinite pronoun kóna ‘another/certain’ (a grammaticalized
number word kón ‘one’). Whereas hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j is derived from the same generic noun hírí
plus a non-grammaticalized number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’ (cf. Jesperson 1917). Compare
the indefinite pronoun hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j of the following examples with one hírkóná shown
above in (13.38a):

The negative interjection ɪmm ɪmm ‘no’ can be used for answering a yes/no question.
But an important point that we may have to notice here is that the non-repeated form
ɪmm does not provide the intended negative meaning. Instead the ɪmm form alone is556used to answering a yes/no question positively or it would mean ~ ‘yes’, as in (13.39cd).

As can be clearly shown in (13.39a-b), ɪmm ɪmm can be used to negate a full question
sentence because oftentimes part of the question or at least the predicate will be
repeated as part of the answer. It is common and natural to get such repeated forms
from the class of interjection and being used as negators.","[576, 577, 578, 579, 580]"

12.4 Tag questions
Tag questions may carry the expectation of confirmation (cf. Dixon 2012: 396). Tag
questions in Mursi are formed by initial declarative clause (the anchor) followed by
adjoined interrogative clause (the tag). Tag questions are normally different from polar
questions in that the tag clause is absent in polar questions. Moreover, the truth value528of the propositions that the answers of polar questions may contain can be fully stated.
It doesn’t matter whether the answers are positive or negative.

The operator verb in both declarative and in the tag clause is a copula verb in
imperfective aspect. The bound negation system on the copula verb of the tag clause
and the raised intonation onto the entire tag clause are main operators which help to
achieve the question.","[550, 551, 552]"

Note that interrogatives in Mursi take all types of case markers that nouns can take (see
Chapter 12). However, rhetorical questions could trigger unusual constituent order in
the language. An instance of such is unusual constituent order is found in the rhetorical
question constructions in which the canonical AVO order become VAO. See the

With regard to indicating syntactic relation by bound pronominal cross referencing on
the verb, there are a number of exceptions to the generalization. The exceptions include:
460A.","[482, 483, 484]"
"Moreover, sentence-final positions,syntactic slots for core and non-core arguments may typically function as focus-bearing
positions when filled by question words. By using Mursi content questions words, one
can question the referents of clause final argument slots (NPs), location, time, quantity,
and so on. On the other hand, a polar question in Mursi can be formed either by raising
the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at end of a clause or by placing noninterrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement.
Besides, Mursi does not adhere to Greenberg’s Universal Hypothesis 12. Greenberg
predicted that VSO languages always have interrogative words sentence-initially. In
Mursi and in other Southeastern Surmic group languages (AVO), interrogative words
always occur sentence-finally. Syntactically, as long as the O argument a is sentencefinal constituent, the difference between VSO [VAO] and AVO is not significant in
interrogative constructions. Of all interrogative words, tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why’ deviates from the
sentence-final pattern. The interrogative word ‘why’ has two varieties, one of which,
tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ, can be placed at sentence-initial position when used in some rhetorical questions.
In the light of the two straightforward question construction formation types and other
less common strategies of interrogatives, this chapters presents a detailed discussion of
508the structure of questions of the language. Thus, in the subsequent sections, content
questions (§12.2), non-interrogative particles (§12.3), polar questions (§12.4), and
other questioning strategies (§12.5) in the language are discussed in detail.
12.2 Content questions
Content question words normally fill both core and non-core argument slots. Since
question words occur at clause-final argument slot within strict constituent order, the
original constituents at the clause-final slot can be placed at clause-initial position.
Moreover, content question words are ‘pro-phrasals’ therefore they may come with
marked case and modification forms (cf. Mütze 2014). Content question words are of
two types: question words and interrogative pronouns. This distinction is based on the
properties that question words often display whenever they fill the non-question words’
syntactic slots, because both types of question words can fill whatever position is
natural for the non-question words corresponding to the same slot.

§12.2.8One basic observation that can be made from the forms of question words in Table 12.1
is the reoccurrence of /n/ and /g/ to distinguish between singular and plural numbers.
Typologically, the n/g(k) singular versus plural alternation is one of the most common
areal features, not only in Surmic languages but also in most languages of Eastern
Sudanic. Besides, except the interrogative tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ that can occur only sentence-initially,
all the rest of the interrogative words always occur at sentence-final positions.
Regarding the morphological status of interrogatives, some appear to have
originated from one common form ɔ̀ŋ even if it is not easy at this stage to trace back
how they fused in such way. Especially, many of the question (interrogative) words
appear to have the formative ɔ̀ŋ or -ɔŋ, may be at some point in early stages of the
language. Yet it is possible to analyze some of them as separate forms or morphemes,
for which each segmentable unit will carry its own independent grammatical meaning.
For example, the interrogative word ɔ́nɔ́ŋɔ́ ‘with what?’ is derived from the non-human
A nominative form ɔ́nɔ́ŋ ‘what?’ and the oblique case marker suffix -ɔ. The
interrogative ɔ́nɔ́ŋ itself appears to be a derived form possibly from nɔ̀ŋ ‘3sg’ (or third
person impersonal pronoun) (see Table 12.1) and the nominative case marker -ɔ (as
prefix). As the forms themselves hint, a number of such plausible explanations could
be presented in order to trace back the origins of Mursi interrogative forms,―but they
may not consist of more than three formative.
Last and Lucassen (1998: 415) noted that the form */a-ŋa/ ‘what’ (with a copula)
have been attested in Proto-Nilotic. They also suggested that this could be one of the
oldest question word formation within the Eastern Sudanic language family. For
instance, present-day languages such as Luo (a-ŋɔ ‘what’) and Päri (a-ŋo ‘what’, a-ŋa
‘who’) have maintained the proto-forms.","[531, 532, 533]"
"12.6.1Disjunctive questionsDisjunctive questions in Mursi are formed with two copular clauses conjoined by the
disjunctive particle wo [oo]. The first copular clause will have a full copular clause
constituent: copula subject, copula verb and copula complement while the second
consists only of the latter two constituents. Both clauses share a single subject, which
is the subject of the first copula clause.

The interrogative statements above seek confirmation whether their references should
be referred by one of the semantically opposing attributes or not. Therefore, the answers
to the propositions in (12.46) can be selected from their copula complements ― as
big/small rather than as yes/no.
The disjunctive particle óó can be also used to show speculation or uncertainty.
Especially, obviously used when someone is not sure of one's own choices. In this
regard, the disjunctive interrogatives in (12.47a-b) are different from the copular
clauses above. As shown below, the first clause is a subordinate followed by the main
clause connected by the disjunctive óó.

"507Chapter 12Questions12.1 Introduction
A question is one of the three speech act types whose grammatical mood value is
expressed by interrogative (cf. Dixon 2012). The two best known question types are
content questions and polar questions. Mursi has both types. Mursi employs content
question words (mostly pronominals) which usually take clause-final argument slots.
Mursi question words occur immediately following the verb at syntactic positions
where grammatical objects naturally belong.","[530, 531]"
"616ashamed’ is an idiomatic verb ― literally meaning ‘to eat (feel) shame/shy’. The above
example is not the only instance where this contrastive coordinative marker
semantically behaves like as cause-result (adversative) linker, but it often denotes the
same semantics especially when it is placed at clause initial position.

grammaticalization process where it got its original adversative semantics from ŋànì
‘not yet, still’ and the subordinate enclitic =jè. Therefore, what can be said at this
stage is that the contrastive coordinative marker ŋànìjè may no longer have an
adversative function when being used at the left most periphery of a given discourse
but rather functions as a coordinative particle (see the example given below).

The mirativity marker čírr ‘actually/really’ can occasionaly be used for a contrastive

position within clauses. As a result of this, the semantics of it is more contextual than
structural. See the following example:

14.3.1.3 Disjunctive coordination
Disjunctive clauses can be indicated by various ways but primarily by disjunctive
coordination (conjunction) markers wo [óó] ‘or’and rarely by kóó ‘or’. Both disjunction
markers can also be combined with other epistemic modality marking particles such as
dubitative ká ‘perhaps/maybe’ and kákó ‘perhaps’.

In (14.104a), the copula subject stands for both copula complements conjoined by the
disjunctive marker. As can be seen in (14.105b), normally it is possible to convey the
same meaning without the disjunctive marker, i.e. by adding a copula verb to second
copular clause. It logically makes sense since the propositions in both do not normally
hold true or false ― as they are question types that seek confirmation and whose answer
can be either a ‘yes-no’ type or repeat the whole clause, or just repeat the subjectless
copular clause form (á čàllì/á gɛ̀rsì).
As listed in Table 14.3, the primary disjunctive marker óó and that of kóó can be
combined with the dubitative marker ka to indicate clauses coordinated in alternative
conjunction ways. The dubitative marker is always a peripheral constituent, ― it may
either occupy the position available before a clause or appear at the right edge of a
619clause (see also Chapter 12, §12.3). Their combination enables us to form a nonequestion type alternative conjunction construction between two clauses and NPs, i.e.
either…or type coordination. This type of coordination is often called correlative
coordination. On the basis of the current observation, the following templates have been
proposed:

A common similarity of these question words is that they all occur sentence-finally.
They can question core and non-core arguments. In referring to non-human participants,
both ɔ̀ŋ ‘what.OBJ’ and ɔ́nɔ́ŋ ‘what.NOM’ also share certain syntactic properties, for
instance, both occur in O function and can be copula complements immediately
following regular or copula verbs. The question word ɔ̀ŋ normally refers to non-human
object participants while ɔ́nɔ́ŋ refers to non-human subject participants.

In both (12.1a-b), ɔ̀ŋ is in O function following the transitive predicates. In (12.1b),
since the interrogative word has taken over the sentence-final position, the oblique
argument is put in sentence-initial position. In addition, the verb root tál ‘buy, sell’ does
not distinguish between imperfective and perfective aspects. So, the second person
bound pronominal suffix -o performs the temporal duty of the verb. Following a copula
verb, the interrogative ɔ̀ŋ can fill a copula complement slot as predicate nominal, as in
(12.2). Since post-verbal position is associated with focus, and content questions
typically also have similarities with focus constructions.

A copula clause consisting of the associative (accompaniment and instrument) word
kàrì ‘together’, and ɔ̀ŋ can be combined into a single function, i.e. to question an
511instrument/object used to perform a certain the action. Even if the object used is already
stated in the question statement, the main function of kàrì plus ɔ̀ŋ is to denote an
incredulous situation. Thus the whole copula structure may be moved to a sentenceinitial position, as in (12.3).

The occurrence of ɔ́nɔ́ŋ in my corpus is very rare hence it requires further in-depth
research. On the other hand, ɔ́nɔ̀ŋɔ́ ‘with.what’ as pointed out above is a question word
that may be used to ask about an instrument used. The instrument function is indicated
in two ways: (i) by an oblique case marker suffix -ɔ, which is added to the form ɔ́nɔ̀ŋ
and yelds the instrumental form ɔ́nɔ́ŋ-ɔ́, and (ii) by a multifunctional free from particle
kó (has an instrumental or a comitative linker function in the examples below).

The coordinator particle kó is used to relate the cause marker particle ɓá with the

Depending on the discourse context in which they occur, both expressions are
ORc. wàappropriate even if (12.9c) is more appropriate than (12.9b), because it is expressed by
a predicate rather than by deverbal noun/NP. (12.9b) explicitly shows person and
number of human participant of the discourse who is being questioned. Thus, obviously
the second person singular is the addressee questioned. One can also ask for the name

reason why a certain incredible situation happened. kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ has stylistic dominance over
tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why?’, which is the only sentence-initial interrogative word. See example 12.13
below (repeated from 7.24).

As the form points out, kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is composed of purpose-like preposition particle kɛ and
the formative ɔ̀ŋ ‘what’, the combination of the two obviously did produce a meaning:
‘for what’. For instance in (12.14), the question sentence seeks an answer for the reason
why the human participant stayed long. However, (12.14) can also be used to question
by which method the participant being questioned used to stay.

An interesting scenario is found in (12.15) where kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is used with tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in the same
interrogative sentence.
(12.15) tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ
ʃíl-Ø-ɛ̀-o
kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ
why
stand-3sg.IRR-COM-MT
why
‘Why did he bring an accusation against him?’
The fact is that both occur in their designated syntactic slots. The enquiry here should
be regarding the function of each reason interrogative words. tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ always occurs
before a verb sentence-initially and has a semantic scope over the entire sentence. So
tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in (12.15) has the function of questioning the whole motive of the sentence in a
single explanation. On the other hand, since kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is a bimorphemic form with one of
its component being ɔ̀ŋ ‘what’, it makes sense for its meaning to express inquiry of the
515purpose 'for what'. As Aikhenvald (2015: 278) states, ‘interrogatives in many languages
do not form one word class in terms of their morphological categories and syntactic
functions’. Mursi adheres to this assertion, for the reason that membership of
interrogative words to one particular word class seems always to be problematic as they
are made up of more than one component. Besides, interrogative words such as kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ
and tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ can belong separate syntactic categories despite sharing the same semantics.
The fact is that this view does not include the interrogative pronouns of the language.
Of the syntactic deviation of tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ from the other question word members, not much is
known at this stage. However, a piece of information has been stated from (Dixon 2012,
Li and Thompson 1981) may indicate the syntactic nature of tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in relation to other
languages. A good example is Mandarin Chinese where a single question word can
mean ‘how’ and ‘why’. In Mandarin, ‘why’ is a sentential adverbial requesting the
respondent to provide a semantic frame for the entire sentence’ (Dixon 2012: 414). In
addition, it can be moved to the beginning of the sentence if the interpretation intended
to be delived is ‘why’.
In light of this, tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in Mursi behaves the same way as in Mandarin. The real
semantics of ‘why’ can only be delivered by tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ and certainly not by kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ. The verb,
mostly, occurs in the irrealis mood. As can be shown in the following sentences, the
interrogative word tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ is fronted for emphasis, when it enquires about the reason why
certain actions took place and expressing a strong rebuke.

In addition, as shown in all of (12.16a-c), sentence-final NPs are marked by a definite
marker enclitic =ŋà. Note that definiteness in Mursi is phrasal-marked at the end NPs
or on constituents that occur at the end of a sentence. tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ can rarely occur sentencefinally, but only in special circumstances, as in (12.17).

12.2.4 òrì ‘where’ and ɓónnój ‘where’
The interrogative words òrì ‘and ɓónnój have one meaning ‘where’. Both are used to
ask questions eliciting answers which would fill the local adverbial slots of a clause.
No locative or oblique case marker is possible to attach to these two location question
forms. The choice of the local interrogative word may depend on the point of reference
of a known location within the speaker’s view, or a location which is not known by the
speaker. The examples given below illustrate this further: òrì (12.20a-c) and ɓónnój

Syntactically, Mursi adverbs may split between sentence-initial and sentence-final
positions. Most manner adverbs occur sentence-finally, even if few of them can occur
at initial positions. The same syntax applies to locative adverbs. Nevertheless, the
clause-final slots occupied by the local interrogative words òrì ‘and ɓónnój in the
examples illustrated above are slots which could be filled by demonstrative formative
type locative adverbs.","[533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542]"

The suffix -ni is a discourse resolution marker but it does not function as an
independent particle. This discourse resolution marker suffix is also found in the
Tirmaga language and has two functions (Bryant 1993: 41). The two functions of -ni in
a narration are: (i) it indicates the resolution of a dilemma or goal, and (ii) it shows the
state of equilibrium has been reached at the conclusion of an episode. In Mursi, -ni
indicates a result or a solution which has taken place after a serious of complicated
actions or events.
In narration, it indicates a settlement or an end of a situation with a positive outcome
after a long standing conflict or situation. Examine the following examples.

(KW 1:28:8)
In both (3.148) and (3.149), the resolutions are outcomes or answers to the question
‘‘so what finally happened?’’. The story behind these two examples is that inThe verb ‘to touch’ is iɲana, and has a root form <iɲ>. In (xxx), there was the first person plural
object suffix -i but has been already assimilated into the root.
24184Mursiland, following the harvest season which takes place twice in a year (DecemberJanuary and June-July), the ɗɔ̀ŋà (middle aged boys) go in large groups into the
cultivation areas and collect the decapitated sorgham stalks (ólʃó). The age grade of the
boys who collect the sorghum stalks is found in Text I (Appendix I). When the
collection of the sorghum stalks is over, the ɗɔ̀ŋà, who collected the stalks, kneel in a
compact group at the tree, facing the rórá (senior), who accuse them, of failing to carry
out the duties of their age grade. This can be very serious if they attack girls while
collecting sorghum stalks because this is not showing sufficient respect to their
‘fathers', the rórá. Therefore this offence becomes ‘Kili’ (as in (3.148)) or it becomes
the issue of the tɛ̀ró (age grade for young men) who attacked the girls (as in (3.149)).
The particle čii is usually used in ironic expressions which indicate astonishment
about something very small. It may be used as a diminutive marker particle and can
appear between the head noun and the modifier within an NP.

3.3.7 Interjections
Mursi has a fair number of interjections which form a small closed class of their own,
a heterogeneous class of words. They mainly serve to express human emotions and
feelings. Unlike other closed word classes in the language, interjections lack fixed
syntactic functions slots. However, a few of them may have clause-initial preferences.
Below is Table 3.15 containing a list of Mursi interjections.

186As it can be seen in the table above, interjections may contain forms that are quite
different from the regular internal phonological structure of words. As we recall, both
consonant and vowel length do not exist in Mursi. Phonetic based consonant and vowel
length may, however, exist word-medially. Examples depicting the use of interjection
are provided below.

(see §13.7).
3.3.8 Ideophones
Mursi ideophones form a separate class of onomatopoeic words. They primarily denote
meanings of actions usually being expressed by action verbs. Aikhenvald (2015: 200)
pointed out that ideophones are ‘sound-symbolic: their phonological form resembles
the sound or impression associated with the action or with the referent’. All Mursi
ideophones, at least the ones listed in Table 3.16 below, consist of mono- and disyllabic
morphemes. Some may occur in inherently reduplicated patterns. jágjágjág seems to
be exceptional in that it has a triplicated pattern.","[205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210]"
"519For example, ɓónnój in (12.22) does not refer a particular place or location so it may
mean also ‘what’. Compare the following examples : the answer to question (12.22) a
question of its' answer could generate a particular location, and (12.23) may not
necessarily have such interpretation.

12.2.5 ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many/much’
Any sentence containing the quantitative interrogative word ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many, how
much’ is one that questions a quantifiable, countable/non-countable, number of
referents.

In fact, the noun gáwá ‘price’ (lit. ‘market ≈ week’) has contributed to the meaning of
‘what’. In the absence of gáwá, this sentence would be ‘how many pencil’ ― just
referring to the quantity instead of the price. The difference between these two
meanings of the question word ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many’/’how much’ requires further study. If
the question is presented as in (12.24b), the possible replies would involve a lexical
520number word either as copula complement or as modifier of a head noun within NP, as
in:

During my long corpus collection in the Mursi community, one important point that I
(12.25) a.learned from Mursi speakers is that their preference for specific types of grammatical
constructions out of many other types mostly depends on stylistic and ideolectal
differences. For instance, (12.25a1) is more preferred than (12.25a2). In addition to
‘how many’, using ísɔ̀ŋ, one can ask questions such as ‘how much’ and ‘how old’.

12.2.6 nɛ̀ŋ and nój ‘who’
The interrogative pronouns nɛ̀ŋ and nój refer to the identity of human referents. The
interrogative pronoun nɛ̀ŋ can occur in O function either following a main verb or a
copula verb. There are two main syntactic slots in which nɛ̀ŋ occurs: direct object of a
521transitive verb and extended argument of a ditransitive verb. nɛ̀ŋ may not be marked
for object case by an overt morphological form because it is inherently an object form
in its own right.

Mursi does not have an interrogative word dedicated for ‘which’. However, nój may
also be used to enquire ‘which’ type of questions. Dixon (2012: 411) noted that ‘who’
can only be used as head of an NP. It could replace ‘which’ as in ‘which X’ if ‘X’ is a
noun with human reference (as in (12.32)).

As it is shown in (12.32a), the number of the referents has been indicated by the verb
to be (also singular existential verb form). Besides, nój is not a modifier since there is
no noun to be modified. However, in (12.32b), the plural specific/relative pronoun is in
a modified form and the modifier could be any noun since the modification/relator
marker attached to it is non-restrictive. Further study is needed to see whether nój is
used to refer to non-human reference.The singular counterpart of (12.32b) is as follows.

The suffix -e attached to the interrogative pronoun is unusual and/or has unclear
function. In most cases, second person singular subject suffix is omitted if a motion
suffix is attached to the verb.
Note ―I mentioned earlier that Mursi lacks an interrogative word for ‘which’.
Although my position is still the same, two unusual forms that appear to have a
'which' reading have been attested in my data. They are inój ‘which.SG’ and gioj
‘which.PL’. As shown in the examples given below, both interrogative forms can refer
either to a human referent or a non-human referent.

In Turton and Bender (1976: 540), the two have been mentioned as ainoi (singular)
and agyoi (plural). They are alike with the forms in (12.35a-c) despite a slight
difference from Turton and Bender's suggestion. The segment a of the ainoi and agyoi
is a copula verb ― and the final segment is approximant rather than a high vowel.
Despite the fact that in Mursi there are some fused grammatical forms which require
further investigation, in fused form gìój in (12.35b), the form -ój is a nominative case
marker; since it follows the copula verb.
12.2.7 nì and gì ‘whose’
The interrogative pronouns nì and gi are singular and plural possessive forms of ‘who’.
Both nì ‘who.GEN.SG’ and gì ‘who.GEN.PL’ occur in modifier position within an NP.
Consequently, any noun that may replace these two possessive interrogative pronouns
is required to occur either in genitive case form or in possessive form. The head noun
form remains unchanged, ― it always occurs in modified/modification form.

genitive forms is that both nìnì and gìgì can occur in full pronoun forms. This means

nominals or as copula complements, they do not necessarily require to occur in genitive

In the examples above, each possessive interrogative pronouns contain two bound
number clitics (as proclitic as well as enclitic) ― in which they indicate only the
526grammatical number of referents (possessors) and the possessed items. They can be
segmented into separate pieces of morphemes. They can even be glossed in almost
equivalent way as possessive pronouns.
12.3 Non-interrogative particles
Non-interrogative particles have different grammatical functions in the language. In
interrogative sentences having non-interrogative particles, the particles (see below in
Table 12.2) can be in a particular discourse context, for instance if the information was
known and in circulation for some time in the past, and/or if the information is believed
to contain hidden facts in a way that creates an exclamative or a dubious situation.

addition, the uncertainty particles ká ‘perhaps’ and tá ‘maybe’, which are not

"12.6 Other question strategies
In addition to the major ways to ask questions elaborated on in the sections above,
Mursi also employs two questioning strategies: disjunctive questions (§12.6.1) and a
clause with lowered intonation on its entire structure (§12.6.2).",[554]

They usually occupy clause-final slots in non-complex clauses and in clauses having a
postposition-free noun modification constructions. Or in a clause containing negation
(as in (3.113a). The postposition báì ‘under, down’ stands apart from the rest in that it
also can be used as verbal word ‘to sit’. When it is used with an existential or a copula
verb of a similar meaning, its verbal function will be neutralized (3.113a-b). Uniquely
from the rest, the postposition báì ‘under, down’ can also occur with the locative case

As it is seen in (3.113c), bai has a repeated form but the repetition does not alter its
basic meaning.
The three Mursi prepositions are sábɔ̀ ‘front, in front of’, tutuɔ ‘in front of’ and
wùrɛ́ɔ́ ‘behind, next, after’. sábɔ̀ and tútúɔ̀ are grammaticalized body part nouns ― sábɔ̀ <head-OBL> and tútúg-ɔ [tútúɣɔ̀] <mouth-OBL>. Furthermore, tútúgɔ̀ ‘door, gate' has
been made a re-lexicalized body part noun, which itself is the origin for the latter
meaning. Thus tutuɔ is a derived from tùgɔ̀ ‘mouth’ just by reduplicating root and
adding the oblique case marker suffix -ɔ to the reduplicated form [tùg.tùg+ɔ].

3.3.4 Question words
Question words form a class of their own but can primarily be realized in two
subclasses: simple-forms and modification-forms. Simple forms may occur with or
without case markers. For example, ɔ́nɔ́ŋ ‘what?’ is a simple form without a case
marker. But when an oblique (instrumental) case marker suffix -ɔ is attached to ɔ́nɔ́ŋ,
it forms a different question word, ɔ́nɔ́ŋɔ́ ‘with.what’ (Lit. ‘by what means’). For a
complete list of Mursi question words, see §12.2 (Table 12.1).

On the other hand, modification forms are those inherently occuring as modifiers within
(3.118) a. bèNPs ― nì <who.GEN.SG> ‘whose (sg.)’ and gì <who.GEN.PL> ‘whose (pl.)’. Any noun
that replaces these two possessive question words is required to occur either in genitive

As is shown in (1.5b), in an AOV order, due to strict orders of constituents, negated
verbs need to be moved to a clause final positions, and arguments in A/S function are
often forced to appear at clause-initial position. In (1.6a-b), the nominative case system
of Mursi operates based on an OVA/VS constituent order. Thus post-verbal subjects in
this constituent order are morphologically and formally marked by marked-nominative
case suffix -o, for a transitive post-verbal subject argument marker (A) (as in (1.6a-b)
Mursi marks both the head noun and the dependent form. There are morphological
markers for the head noun and for the dependent (modifier) called ‘restrictive and nonrestrictive modification’ form. As a head and dependent marking language, all
dependents or modifiers, except number words and quantifiers are required to indicate
their dependency relation with the head nouns they modify always by an overt
morphological inflection: -a (for restrictive) and -i [-ti] (for non-restrictive). This
dependency phenomenon between head nouns and dependents is widely known as
'Construct-Form' (CF) by some Semitists. In Semitic languages this phenomenon is also
known by a different term ― ‘construct state’. In fact, other terms are also used: ‘status
constructus’ (Tucker and Bryan 1966), ‘modified noun form’ (Reh 1996), and
‘construct form’ (Creissels 2006). In Mursi, both the head noun and the dependent can
be marked by the same dependency modification markers: HEAD.NOUN-a DEPENDENT
11(MODIFIER)-a (restrictive) or HEAD.NOUN-i [-ti] DEPENDENT (MODIFIER) (-i [-ti])
(nonrestrictive).
In Mursi, within NPs, head nouns are obligatorily marked by restrictive (as in (1.7))
and nonrestrictive (as in (1.8-1.9) forms because head nouns are required to fulfill the
role of head nouns on the basis of internal structure of NPs.

The underived adjective bú functions as an intensifier, not as a modifier. Thus the
(1.8)relationship of the head is directly with the quantifier, i.e. mɛ̀rì. However, within a
similar NP construction, if bu functions as quantifier, any other modifier following it
may not be marked by a nonrestrictive modification marker, as in (1.10).

In this grammar, as far as this marking is concerned, instead of the term constructform, I prefer to call it ‘modification marker’ (see details of it in Chapter 4).
The same noun modification markers apply in possessive constructions when
indicating possession/ownership in light of the head and/or possessed (D) and the12dependent and/or possessor (R) dependency relationship within the syntactic frame of
‘NP-internal possessive construction’. Accordingly, Mursi has five NP-internal
possessive construction types: one structure where R (the possessor) and D (the
possessed human/animate/inanimate item/object are simply juxtaposed within NP ―
and four other distinct structures where D is followed by R. A possessive relationship
that can be expressed by a juxtaposed possessor and possessed is very different from
all other possessive relationship construction types. Morphologically, both possessor
and possessed nouns do not take any markers. This means that, the possessed item is
not marked by ‘restrictive/nonrestrictive modification or ‘relator suffix -a. The same is
true for the possessor, which does not take any marker including the genitive case, for
example, híríR sáràD <man.SGname.PL> ‘The man’s name’. There is no marking oneither the possessor or the possessed. The noun sárá ‘name’ is an inherently plural noun
in Mursi and has no singular counterpart, but the meaning hasn't been affected and still
has a singular interpretation. The remaining four types of possessive constructions
within an NP involve POSSESSED(D)-a R{where the R is a POSSESSOR-GEN (as in (1.11)
or a POSSESSIVE PRONOUN (1.12) or a PERTENSIVE MARKER (1.13)).

As we can see in the examples shown above, the modification marker or the relator
suffix attached to D should always be identical. The fifth type of ‘NP-internal
possessive construction’ in Mursi is called ‘Noun modification construction’ (NMC).
It is normally the same as with the three NP construction types mentioned earlier, i.e. a
13structure where D is followed by R. Yet it stands apart from all previously mentioned
possessive construction types because it may involve a series of intermediate possessors
(Rs)/modifiers. Therefore the D and the intermediate R’s are marked by restrictive
modification marker/relator marker -a while the real possessor is marked by the
genitive case marker. The restrictive modification marker/relator marker -a is marked
on both NP constituents (the possessed/head noun and on the intermediate
possessors/modifiers) (see more in Chapter 4). Welmers (1973) used the term
‘associative construction’ in reference to nouns which express a wide range of semantic
relationships with other nouns occurring as modifiers within the same NP. See the
following examples.

How aspect is shown in Mursi has been mentioned earlier, so here I focus on mood
category. The mood category of Mursi includes imperative, hortative, jussive, reality,
and subjunctive. All are expressed by inflectional markings on the verbs. Only the
hortative and the jussive moods can be marked by an optional morphological particle
aj/aɲ. In Mursi, the imperative mood refers to a command given to an addressee (the
second person). The verb utilized in the positive imperative construction must always
occur in the perfective aspect. The negative imperative construction utilizes a verb in
the imperfective aspect. However, in both constructions number can be marked on the14verb. The plural suffix -V is marked on the verb to denote plural addressee while the
bare perfective verb root in its own indicates singular addressee. Person of the subject
is unmarked. Verb-final suffixes -a (for singular), -ɛ (for plural) and a variant of both,
-o can be added to a clause-finally occurring verbs of the imperative constructions.

Unlike the positive imperative, the negative imperative utilizes an imperfective verb
root and different number suffixes ― despite both being commands used to deliver a
speaker's intent that a certain course of action must be carried out within a specified
period of time. The negative imperative utilizes the imperfective negative proclitic ŋà=,
imperfective verb root, and two invariable number suffixes -i (for singular addressee)
and -o (for plural addressee). See the examples below.

The hortative and the jussive in Mursi are non-canonical imperative moods directed
to first and third persons and can be used to denote a mild command. Like the canonical
imperative, positive hortative and jussive moods utilize a verb in the perfective aspect
for positive whereas negative hortative and jussive moods utilize a verb in the
imperfective aspect. An interesting prosodic feature here is that a grammatical tone will
be used to distinguish between the hortative and the jussive form. The hortative mood15takes a low-toned prefix hortative k(V̀ )- and a low-toned verb root. It may optionally be
preceded by a free form high-toned hortative particle áj [áɲ] (as in (1.22).

The jussive mood refers to a command directed at the third person. The jussive mood
marker prefix k(V)- and the verb always carry a low-toned melody. Besides, the jussive
marker prefix (k(V)-) will not be marked when the negated form is used (as in (1.25c)).

Subjunctive is one of the three moods in Mursi which are expressed by the irrealis(1.25)morphological marker within the perfective aspect. Subjunctive, like the other two
irrealis moods (hortative and jussive), utilizes a prefix k(V)- and a perfective verb root.
(The details await us in Chapter 7.)
Adjectives are one of the three open word classes of Mursi. Adjectives are open
classes by derivation. Based on the morphological properties they display, Mursi
adjectives can be divided into two major categories: underived (tííní ‘small’ and bùì
‘big’) and derived (Type I― mainly from stative verbs; Type II ― derived from stative16verbs and from other word classes through productive and unproductive morphological
derivations). The two underived adjectives display sound iconicity. This phenomenon
is an association between sound and meaning. Dixon (2010:69) pointed out that a high
front vowel i is often naturally associated with a little/small object and a high back
vowel u with a big/large one. Adjectives always bear the general adjectiviser suffix -i,
regardless of each adjective's morphological property. Syntactically, adjectives can
modify the head of an NP, fill the head of an intransitive predicate slot (as in (1.26)),
fill copula complement slots, denote degree of the compared quality in comparative
constructions, and function as manner modifiers. The adjective class of Mursi covers
all semantic types that can be conveyed by adjectives.

NEG.IMPERV=fat-3SG.SU.IMPERV=NEG
‘S/he is not fat.’
Reduplication is the only way of marking number on underived adjectives (as in
(1.27 and 1.28)). Only the underived adjective can take degree of magnitude markers:
free form gòɗé (gèɗé) (diminutive ‘very small’) and the suffix -sís (augmentative ‘very
big’).

big:REDUP.PL-RSTR local-GEN-GEN

As Mursi is a free-constituent order language, the order among adjectives within NPs
and in sentences is relatively free. As to the ordering of adjectives within NPs,
throughout the adjective chapter and this grammar, no more than two adjectival
modifiers are available. The details of adjectives are the topic of Chapter 8.
Mursi has four valency decreasing and four valency increasing derivations. The
valency decreasing derivations are passive, antipassive, reciprocal, and reflexive.
17Benefactive, applicative/comitative, causative, and directional/motion increase the
number of core arguments. Each valency changing derivations may employ more than
one strategies, for example, the reciprocal derivation has four different possibilities
while reflexive derivation has at least two possibilities (these are topics that have been
discussed in detail in Chapter 9).
Grammatical relations in Mursi are marked by constituent order and case. However,
case-marking is often employed depending on constituent order system of the language.
Mursi is a nominative-accusative language. Although Mursi utilizes case-marking, it is
also a head-marking language that has cross-referencing bound pronominal forms to
indicate grammatical relations. As a head-marking language, it has participant reference
markings on the verb which predominantly indicate grammatical relations. This
operates by indexing bound pronominal A and O argument affixes on the verb. In
ditransitive clause constructions, argument indexing on the verb often operates
according to referential prominence scale hierarchy and verb-adjacency constraint
principles (see more on grammatical relations in Chapter 10).
Mursi has sophisticated and elaborate comparative construction techniques.
Comparative constructions explicitly indicate participants being compared and
parameter of comparison (often adjectives). Index of comparison may be indicated by
attaching a benefactive/dative marker suffix to the element of the parameter of
comparison, i.e. ‘comparative-benefactive’. Mursi has a total of seven types of
comparative constructions: mono-clausal, phrasal plus mono-clausal, bi-clausal (are of
two type TYPE I and TYPE II), connector ɓá ‘place’, hɛ́kó…tɛ̀b ‘same…as’/hɛ́tɔ́…tɛ̀b
‘be.same…as’ (‘as…as’), and one additional strategy. (Chapter 11 offers more
interesting details on comparative constructions.)18Mursi has both question types: content questions and polar questions. Content
question words (mostly pronominals) usually occupy clause final argument slots. As a
language with an AVO canonical order of constituents, all Mursi question words occur
immediately following the verb, i.e. a syntactic position available for grammatical
objects. Moreover, sentence-final positions, syntactic slots for core and non-core
arguments, may typically function as focus-bearing positions when filled by question
words. On the other hand, a polar question in Mursi can be formed either by raising
the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at end of a clause or by placing noninterrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement (see details in Chapter 12).
Typologically, negation constructions in Mursi show various striking features. In
Mursi, a number of different negation strategies may be employed to negate verbal
constituents. The strategies vary depending on grammatical systems or categories such
as aspect, mood, and person-subject. For instance, a verb in the imperfective aspect can
be negated by bound circumclitics whereas a verb in the perfective aspect is negated by
independent perfective negative particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet, still’ plus by
negative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root. Interestingly, negative
declarative clauses have an obligatory SV/AOV, constituent order, for which negated
verbs always occupy clause-final positions. This is a syntactic phenomenon that works
only for order of negated predicates in negative clauses, which is different from the
affirmative clauses in a canonical constituent order SV/AVO and from clauses having
a marked-nominative and case marked S/A subjects OVA (in a transitive clause) VS (in
an intransitive clause). Many more interesting features of the negation system are
discussed in Chapter 13.
Mursi has the following main clause types: conditional, temporal, speech report
clause, complement clause, copular clause, and obligation/deontic clause. Each clause19type may utilizes one or more varieties of clause combining/linking strategies. In Mursi,
clauses can be combined or linked by the following four major clause combining
techniques: subordination, complementization, relativisation, and coordination. For
instance, a speech report clause in Mursi is introduced by the quotative marker ké
<QUOT> ‘that’. It always precedes the speech verbs such as élí 'call' and sé 'say'; but it
may precede or follow the speech report. ké also functions as complementizer, so the
term ‘quotative-complementizer’ would best explains it.
In some circumstances, it is important to take into account that certain clause types
may follow strict subordination rules. Thus, for instance, a conditional clause
construction must contain the conditional particle hùllì ‘if, when’, which almost always
occurs at the beginning of the subordinate clause; whereas a constituent that occurs at
the subordinate clause-final position is being marked by the subordinate clause marker
enclitic =jè [=è] (as in (1.29)).

"As it is shown in (3.61a), like personal pronouns specific pronouns cannot occur in
copula complement slots. Thus the interrogative pronoun gìój is set to co-occur side by
side with specific pronoun ìgg. If ìgg were a nominal or an NP, it would have been
152questioned like a copula complement and will have the structure of *(3.61b). They are
also demonstrative-like because they may take proximal/distal marker enclitics (as in
(3.61a)).
Other than the two similarities mentioned above, special pronouns are just like the
English dummy ‘one’. When they function as third person special pronoun or dummy,
they can be modified by either restrictive or nonrestrictive modifiers. Some examples
are given below.

pronouns are usually modified exactly the same way as nominals. As it is illustrated in
(3.62), they are marked for non-restrictive modification marker because interrogatives,
quantifiers and numerals are non-restrictive modifiers in Mursi. In (3.62b1), írsásí is

There are three ordinal numbers in Mursi. Further discussion is in §6.11.2 (cf. p.29091). Two of them are derived from the number words ‘two’ and ‘three’ ― ràmàn-nè
<two-ORD> ‘second’ and sízzì-nè <three-ORD> ‘third’ The ordinal number word for
'one' is a grammaticalized body part noun sábá ‘head’ ― sábá > sábɔ̀ ‘front, in front
of’ (preposition) > sábɔ̀ ‘before’ (time word) > sabu-ne ‘first’ (ordinal number).

But only the number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j is used to convey a distributive meaning. This can be

In addition, when any number word higher than ‘two’ is used side by side with the

‘three times’ (Lit. ‘three bellies’) (see Chapter 6).","[198, 199, 200]"
"The interrogative word used in (14.38) is ɛ̀nɛ̀ŋ ‘how’, which seems more of a rhetorical
question in that the speaker is expressing his/her wish or intent; but at the same time it
does looks like he/she asking for an opinion 'how would it be if...or what others might
say if he/she is willing to die instead of (on behalf of) someone, and so on’.). In fact,
the notion of wish or a wish/intent clause in Mursi is mainly expressed by the
rhetorical/reason interrogative word tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why’ followed by the conditional marker
húllí ‘if’ > ~ tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ hùllì ‘why if’. If, however, it is the case of a typical wish expressions,
tԑnԑŋ hùllì becomes a complement of the main clause, as in (14.39).

This is a grammar of Mursi (ethnologue code ISO 639-3 muz), a Surmic language which
belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family. This grammar is the first detailed
description of Mursi language written based on an immersion fieldwork in the villages
of the Mursi community between 2017 and 2019. Consequently, a considerable amount
of examples incorporated in this grammar came from the data collected during the two
years which mainly include an extensive corpus of texts from different genres. This
grammar is also based on a linguistic analysis theoretical framework called Basic
Linguistic Theory (BLT). Following BLT, this reference grammar has incorporated
fourteen chapters covering the phonology, morphology and syntax of the language. The
result is thus a full documentation for the speakers of this little-known language. It is
also a valuable source material for linguists and anthropologists who are interested in
ethnocultural documentations, and for typologists who are interested in the areas of
descriptive and comparative studies of the Surmic Group languages.vTable of Contents

numbering around 7,500 (Population Census Commission, 2007), who live in the
Lower Omo Valley (5° 20' N and 6° 14' N), Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples
Regional State (SNNPRS), Ethiopia. The Mursi are called by alternative names: Murzi,
Murzu, Murutu (see Map 2), Meritu, Dama, and Mùnɛ̀n. The Amhara (the so-called
highlanders or kúchúmbáj by the Mursi) call them Mursi and their language mursiɲa.
Their southern neighbors (the Nyangatom) call them ɲikalabɔŋ1 and their nearest
neighbours the Bodi (Me’en) call them Dama. However, the Mursi2 call themselves
mùn and their language mùnɛ̀n. They speak Mursi (Ethnologue code ISO 639-3 muz),
a Surmic language which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family. Their territory
has a size of 2,000 km2 – and is located in the South Omo Zone of Southwestern
Ethiopia. They live in four villages, namely: Mákkí (also known by the Mursi as
Mákó3), Móyzó, Bóngózó, and Rómós (Hayl-Wuha) (see Map 3). These villages lie
between two rivers, namely: the Omo (known to the Mursi Wárr) to the west and the
Mago to the east – and are surrounded two National Parks named after these two rivers
(Omo and Mago) ― see Map 1.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

Interestingly, when S and O pronominal arguments attach to adjectival roots, their main
(8.47)meaning of the inflected adjectival root is causative and inchoative. In fact, inchoative
readings come in two ways: by bound pronominal in S function (8.48) and by the
perfective copula te (8.49).

‘S/he became thin by her/him not drinking milk.’In (8.48), the head noun which denotes a state of quality is a derived noun from the
adjective kɔ̀rɔ̀ì. It is an NP on its own (in S function) followed by an intransitive
predicate with an optional oblique argument. The multi-function particle ɓá ‘place, in
408place, by’ is a cause marker in reason clauses, and along with reason-applicative marker
-ɛ, may denote a substantival deverbal nominalization reading ‘for (by) not drinking’.
In this case, the adjective is a copula complement.
Unlike the O argument in (8.46), nɔ̀ŋ in (8.49) indicates the object of a causative.
Since grammatical relations in Mursi mostly depend on participant reference marking
on the verb, independent arguments are not required as such. When independent
arguments are present as in (8.46) above (ìggè), then they give additional emphasis to
the pronominal argument (be it focal or topical). In addition, the underived adjective in
(8.50) may behave like a stative impersonal verb when being made causative by adding
object marker.

a causative.

(Lit. ‘Where (from who) does my becoming small come from?’)
To illustrate (8.50b), for instance, ɓókónó ‘somewhere; anywhere’ is derived from the
indefinite place particle ɓo <place.INDEF> and indefinite number word (or indefinite
pronoun) kón-ɔ <one/another.INDEF-OBL>. Likewise, ɓónnój ‘where’ is pro-phrasal
interrogative derived from the indefinite place particle ɓó <place.INDEF> and from the
interrogative pronoun in nominative case nój ‘who? (singular human subject)’.
Therefore, when one uses ɓónnój for asking questions, one needs to take into account
that one is asking something like ‘where-who’ type of questions, as in (8.50b) above.
409Besides, adjectives derived from stative verbs can be nominalized, and can not occupy
the predicate slot, as in (8.51).

8.4.3 Copula complement
Adjectives can also function as a copula complement in a copular clause. With no
syntactic restriction, all the adjective classes of Mursi can be copula complements.
Below are examples that illustrate the function of adjectives as copula complement
(8.52).

‘You (sg.) will not pass the examination unless you study.’
In (13.9a), the second person singular bound pronoun suffix is -i and it undergoes a
vowel height harmony change. So i has became e following the negator enclitic =ó. In
negative conditional clauses, the verb of the subordinate clause cannot be negated,
rather the perfective negative particle ŋànì always occurs preceding it. As can be seen
in the examples above, it makes sense for conditional clauses to operate depending on
imperfective aspect because the propositions they contain are often hypothetical. It is
also highly likely the case that the negation in imperfective aspect indicates a given
action is not going to happen. Considering this we may assume that subordinate
conditional clause verbs therefore, will obviously occur in the imperfective aspect.
However, this is not the case in Mursi. In Mursi, the subordinate conditional clause
can contain the negative word ŋànì followed by a verb in subjunctive form. Like in the
imperative constructions, person cannot be marked on the subjunctive form when the
subject is second person. Person on the subjunctive form may be shown by various
forms of the verb root itself. Regarding this, Randal (1998: 248) pointed out that there
may be a possibility that historically the negative marker was a verb. This is due to the
fact that, when the main verb is negated it appears in the subjunctive form, which
usually cannot mark the main verb of the subordinate clause. At this point, it is
appropriate to mention that proclitics in Mursi can form a grammatical word while
539enclitics cannot. I hypothesise that the negative perfective particle ŋànì ‘not yet’ may
be a derived grammatical word that got its modal dependent form from the negative
marker proclitic ŋà= ― plus a copula verb *an and singular imperative suffix *i. But
this has to be proven, which I guess is a matter of time. In the meantime, the following
structural similarities have been found in negative jussive and negative interrogative
constructions using a copula verb, as in (13.10a-b).
(13.10) a. nɔ̀ŋ

‘Let him not become/be (!)’
b. ŋà=án-í
nɔ̀ŋ?
NEG.IMPERV=COP.IMPERV-SG
3sg
‘Shall he not become/be?’
In Mursi, the negative word ŋànì whether imperfective or perfective, always occurs
before the main verb. Arguably, Dixon (2012: 95) puts it, ‘Cross-linguistically, there is
a strong tendency for negative particles to occur early in the clause’.
Therefore, in (13.9a-b), the negative particle ŋànì comes in the subordinate clause
following the object or immediately following conditional/temporal marker húllí and is
followed by the main clause which contains a negative imperfective main verb. Note
that, however, a perfective verb root can never be combined with the imperfective
negation proclitic ŋà=.
In addition, negation in the imperfective aspect can be used to ask rhetorical
questions in a way that also indicates the sarcastic attitude/characters that people may
show or possess.

‘Am I not a student?’
The speaker does know that he is indeed a student, so everybody knows this fact. But
he is talking as if his studentship as well as the education he got is a joke.
540The other interesting but unusual behavior of the bound imperfective negator is in the
imperative clause. Imperative clause in Mursi is formed by attaching the negator
proclitic ŋà= to an imperfective verb. The negator enclitic =ó cannot be used in the
negative imperative clause construction. The template of a negative imperative
construction is as follows:
ŋà=ROOT.IMPERV-i…..singularŋà=ROOT.IMPERV-o…..plural(13.12) a. ŋà=ɓág-í
NEG.IMPERV=eat.IMPERV-SG

‘You (pl.) don't eat!’
d. ŋà=čóll-ó
NEG.IMPERV=sing.IMPERV-PL
‘You (pl) don't sing!’
On the other hand, positive imperative is formed by using a perfective verb root.
Besides, singular cannot be on the verb, while plural is usually marked on the verb by
copying the vowel of the verb root. This means that there are distinct number markers
being utilized by negative and positive imperative clauses ― negative imperative -i
(singular) and -o (plural); positive imperative unmarked (singular) and -V (plural). Once
again, vowel coalescence may happen between the first person plural bound pronominal
O argument suffix -i and singular negative imperative –i, as in (13.13b-c).

We recall that the syntactic position of negated verbs within negated clauses are clause
final. But in (9.51), the predicate, which is marked by the applicative comitative
derivational suffix -čo, has to occur in a canonical constituent order, i.e. preceeding the
applicative argument in O function (màìgùá gùj ‘your (pl.) husbands’). Likewise,
question clauses containing derived applicative arguments will always follow the
canonical constituent order, as in (9.51).

In (9.52), either the copula subject or the entire copular clause can be a syntactic slot
for placing an applicative argument.
A prototypical derived applicative clause in Mursi involves a subject argument of a
derived applicative clause (A), an object argument a derived applicative clause (AP-O),
and the original object argument of the underlying transitive clause (O).

On adjectives, the suffix -ɛ̀sɛ̀n may function as comparative marker suffix, and it is a polyfunctional

"3.2.3AdjectivesAdjectives comprise the third largest open word class in Mursi. Adjectives comprise an
open class just by derivation. Without their derived members, adjectives would have
formed a closed class consisting of just two members ― tííní ‘small’ and búí ‘big’. Due
to their phonological and morphosyntactic properties they display, I have labeled these149two adjectives as 'underived'. Thus the two form one of the smallest subclasses of
words in the language (see §8.2.1 & §8.3.1).
Adjectives share a number of grammatical properties with nouns and verbs. For
example, adjectives may be marked for number in the same way as nouns. When
modifying the head of an NP, they may take nominal grammatical categories such as
case and definite markers, as in (3.57).

examples clearly show the grammatical categories that both adjectives and verbs have

Syntactically, adjectives can modify the head of an NP, fill the head of an intransitive
predicate slot, fill copula complement slots, denote degree of the compared quality in
comparative constructions, and function as manner modifiers.
The adjective class of Mursi covers all semantic types that can be conveyed by
adjectives. A total of about 160 adjectives have been identified in this study (see
Chapter 8).

question words, number words and quantifiers, connectors, interjections, ideophones,

In Suri (a much closer language to Mursi, Southeastern Surmic group), indefinite
pronouns are often used in presentational sentences to introduce new participant or
ideas to the listener (Bryant 2013: 52). The distinction between kón and ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’
rests on the morphosyntactic properties they display (3.78) (see also Chapter 6).

‘My mother and his mother are one (the same).’ (KW 2:34:4)
As it is the case in many other languages of the world, the development of kón/kóná
(3.78)from a number word to an indefinite pronoun is a simple grammaticalization process.
This was be substantiated by Givón (1981) who noted that the development of the
numeral ‘one’ as a marker for singular-indefinite nouns or indefinite marker is a
universal process.","[180, 181, 182]"
"The criteria/properties listed above satisfy nearly all criteria for a prototypical passive
construction in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2000: 7). In addition to these criteria, in a
passive clause construction, the verb must occur in perfective aspect, and must always
have a low tone. Let us see how they interact and work in a clause:

PREPmúɗáí]PERIPHERAL
ratIn both (9.1a) and (9.2a), the O arguments in the active clauses (tílá and rɔ̀sɔ) are S
arguments in the passive clauses (as in (9.1b and 9.2b)). The original A arguments
423become optional arguments thus they are pushed into a peripheral function ― either by
the grammaticalized nominal ɓá (as in (9.1b)) or by preposition/comitative particle ké
(as in (9.2b)). When the grammaticalized nominal ɓá functions as preposition, it acts
as head of an NP thus the original A argument following it, will be marked with genitive
case, the same as regular head modifiers within an NP.
If the active clause contains A, O and peripheral arguments, the A argument may
not be important at all. Therefore, in the passive version of such active clause will only
contain the derived S (the original O) and the peripheral arguments, as in (9.3). The
examples illustrated below were obtained by elicitation, and some questions were taken
from Mütze (2014)

In the passive clause shown in (9.3b), the agent (the original A) is downgraded but one
knows that there was an agent involved to carry out the activity with the instrument
shown by the peripheral argument. The peripheral argument in (9.2b) differs from
(9.3b) in that the preposition/comitative particle ke in the former directly functions as
agent (original A). On the other hand, the peripheral argument in (9.3b) only refers to
the instrument used by the agent. When the peripheral argument is being made optional,
verb-final suffix may be attached to the verb in passive form (9.3c).

13.3 Negating a copula clause
Mursi copula verbs can be negated in the same way as regular verbs. Thus copula
clauses are also negated in the same way as verbal clauses. In copula clauses, the
copula complement indicates either identity or attribution, as in (13.27a-c).

Since all negated constituents in Mursi take clause final positions, copula complements
in negative copula clauses will move to clause second position and thus take the549syntactic slots next to the copula subjects. The third person copula verb form has the
invariable form a.
It has two negative varieties: (i) ŋaano ([ŋaɁano] ~ <ŋà=án=ó>) (13.27a) which
indicates that it has been a consonant-final root at an early stage of the language, and
(ii) ŋajo ([ŋajo] ~ <ŋà=á=ó>) which shows it is indeed an uninflected form of a.

when negated copula forms are being used in tag question constructions. In addition,
the instance in which the tag forms occur with independent pronouns can be
substantiated by the fact that the sentences (but not the tags) involve non-copula verbs.

With regard to scope, it is worth mentioning the distinction between the negative clitics
and negative copula forms in sentences. The negator clitics ŋà= and =ó have scope
over the predicate of a clause while the negative copula forms in Table 13.3 above have
sentential/clausal scopes. The third person negative copula form ŋàánó {ŋàɁánó or ŋàjó
~ [ŋà=á=ó]} can negate almost any sentence/clause and therefore has a scope that
extends beyond negating a single constituent of a sentence/clause. So ŋàánó/ŋàjó can
be called sentential/clausal negator.
13.4 Negative existential verb níŋɛ ‘not present’
The negative verbal lexeme níŋɛ ‘not present, without’ is used to negate existential or
locational clauses. níŋɛ̀ is an impersonal form that functions as a general negator of
existential or locational clauses regardless of person or number of the subject.

inflected (13.31b).

It can inflect for person of the S argument but in a rather unique way. Only bound
pronominal O argument markers can be marked on it. The alveolar nasal n is inserted
between the root-like form of the negative existential verb and participants that occur
as direct objects.

‘They didn’t exist’As illustrated in Table 13.4 and Table 13.5, negative existential verb form in the
imperfective and the perfective aspects are almost identical in a number of ways. There
are however two exceptional differences, ― (i) the forms in the third person display552inflected and uninflected forms, and (ii) those in Table 13.4 take verb-final suffixes
because they are intransitive verbs in the imperfective aspect whereas those in Table
13.5 take portmanteau suffixes. At a first glance, these portmanteau suffixes look like
those that are copied from the vowel of the verb root, for instance, the suffix -i. But
they are not applicable to all and do not show any consistency throughout the paradigm.
Therefore, regarding the nature of these portmanteau suffixes, further study is
needed. Note that the negative existential verb níŋɛ̀ has a positive counterpart which
exhibits inherently singular and plural forms in its roots. Most importantly, this negative
existential verb does occur anywhere in the clause where it is deemed necessary. Some
examples are given below:

In (13.32a), ŋànìjè itself may sometimes function as a contrastive negative marker and
has been discussed in one of the subsequent sections. In (13.32b), the relative clause
construction functions as a copula subject. Like any other regular verbs, the negative
existential verb níŋɛ̀ can also be restrictively nominalized when it occurs in relative
clauses (as in (13.32b)).","[572, 573, 574, 575, 576]"
"6.10 Reduplication
Reduplication is not a productive morphological way to indicate grammatical number
in Mursi. However, reduplication may be a semi-productive way to indicate plural
number on the two underived adjectives. As it can be shown in the examples below,
plural forms of the two underived adjectives of Mursi is shown by reduplication.

(Lit. ‘The big (pl.) people know.’)6.11 Number words
The Mursi have a fully inflected verb toj ‘count’ which they often use to count heads
of cattle. This is related to decisions usually made by informants pertaining to the
distribution of bridewealth of counting at least 37 head of cattle. This will be undertaken
with a tally counting ―usually using small stones or pebbles.
Mursi has a ten- based number system, also known as ‘decimal system’. See §3.3.1.1
for a full list of Mursi number words. Unlike some Surmic languages, number words
one to ten are non-loan ones. In addition, unlike some Surmic languages, Mursi does
not form number words six to nine by combining the lower numerals and the quinary
form (five as the base). For number words higher than ten, a combining tɔ́mɔ́n ‘ten’,
hírkón ‘twenty’, etc and number words one to nine are used together (see §3.3.1.1 Table
3.12). The particle kó ‘and’ functions as a conjunction particle to connect two number
words and form a number word that is higher than them. The number word for ‘twenty’282hírkón is a compound word derived from two words: the noun hírí ‘man’ and the
indefinite number word kón ‘one’ (Lit. ‘One man/person’; referring to ten fingers and
ten toes of one man). Therefore, the number word ‘twenty’ and the multiples of 'twenty'
do not require the conjunction particle kó (see Table 6.4 below). The number word for
‘hundred’ has two forms ―the Mursi form zùwò háánán (Lit. ‘five people’) and the
Amharic form matto <mäto>.

There is a clear difference between the number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j and kón ―not only in the
way they are combined with other number words but also in the way they modify nouns
within NPs. As we recall from Chapter 4, when nouns are modified by number words
higher than two, they do not take modification or dependency markers (restrictive
and/or non-restrictive), as in the following examples.

However, the number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’ stands apart from the rest of number words
because it triggers the head to be marked with a non-restrictive modification marker.
In an NP where ɗɔ́nɛ́j is the modifier, regardless of the head's word class status, the
non-restrictive modification marker -i/-ti must be attached to the singular head (6.76ac).

‘Two blind men (two of the blind men)
From the example in (6.77), one can easily understand that there were some other men,
at least more than two.
On the other hand, the indefinite marker/word kón ‘one’ can function alone or be
combined with other nouns. When combined with nominals, it usually yields indefinite
pronouns (see §3.3.1.5, Table 3.7). Both ɗɔ́nɛ́j and kón may function as a modifier
within an NP. Interestingly, the head modified by kón does not take any modification
marking, however, kón itself as a modifier can take another modification marker (-a or
-o).

For example, ɗɔ́nɛ́j may occur in a reduplicated form and be used with the plural form
of ‘belly’ kɛ̀ŋì in order to create a distributive meaning. In contrast, kón cannot be
reduplicated but can take other morphology for example the restrictive modification
marker. In simple clauses, kón can function as S argument while ɗɔ́nɛ́j cannot.
Nevertheless, ɗɔ́nɛ́j has at least one role in clauses, a copula complement. In Table 6.6
below, a brief comparison between the number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j and the indefinite word kón
is presented as follows.

6.11.2 Deriving ordinal number words
With regard to the development of ordinal numbers, Dixon (2012: 74) stated that in
many cases they are derived from their cardinal congeners. Mursi has three ordinal
numbers. Of these, two of them are derived from lower cardinal ràmàn ‘two’ and sízzí
‘three’. Thus, the ordinal number ‘second’ and ‘third’ are formed by attaching the
morphological marker suffix -nè to them ― ràmàn-nè <two-ORD> and sízzì-nè
<three-ORD>. Examples were given in §3.3.5.1. Additional examples are presented as
follows.

‘And on the third day he shall rise.’a. nàIn order to create an innovative form of ordinal number higher than ten, one should
attach the ordinal number marker suffix -ne to the smaller cardinal number on the right
edge (cf. p179). However, at this stage, it only applies to one ordinal number form
higher than ten, i.e. ‘twelfth’, as in the following examples.

As can be shown in the examples stated above, post-verbal pronouns in the intransitive

Following the verb ker the nominative pronoun form is in the S function, and following
the copula verb there is an interrogative word ɛ̀nɛ̀ŋ, a form often used for the expression
of ‘will or wish’. Note that the occurrence of the conditional/temporal word húllí
‘if/when’ does not show that the clause is a conditional/subordinate clause. Conditional
clauses have their own specific formula ― always begin with húllí and always end with
a word marked by a subordinate marker suffix =jè (húllí (x) (y)…(z)=jè). In addition,
clauses that refer to speakers 'will/wish' have húllí at their clause-initial positions in the
same way as conditional clauses.

farAs illustrated in (10.47a-b), locative case marking suffixes are attached to nouns
referring to both non-specified and specified/specific static places. The other rare as
well as controversial locative marker is morpheme -ni. At this stage I was unable to
make any assertion about its grammatical status ―whether it is a locative case or some
sort of locative suffix. Last and Lucassen (1998) have claimed that the suffix -ni in Chai
(a dialect of Tirmaga, a Southeast Surmic group language) is a locative particle.
However, Bryant (2007: 42) rejected the claim made by Last and Lucassen. Bryant has
noted that -ni is not a locative particle in Tirmaga rather it has a discourse function on
its own. As evidence for this, he presented -ni which can occur where there is no
anaphoric reference to a previously mentioned location. In addition to this, he also
added that anaphoric references to a previously mentioned locations are found in
Tirmaga without the locative suffix -ni.
Mursi and the two languages mentioned above together constitute a single dialect
continuum, and these languages in fact display almost identical grammatical structure
with Mursi. The evidence stated by Bryant about the suffix -ni as having a discourse
function is plausible, but it cannot prevent the suffix -ni from being a locative marker.
484However, what I have observed in my corpus is that the locative suffix -ni often occurs
on postpositions but it does not occur on simple nouns. See the examples below:

The genitive case in Mursi is a case which is marked on nouns or on any other categories
that modify heads of NPs. In particular, common nouns can be modified by other nouns
with a genitive case form. All the modifying nouns must occur in genitive case form
while the head noun must be marked with a modification form (see Chapter 4; §4.2.3).
The morpheme -ɲ is a general genitive case marker suffix and has a number of other
allomorphs.

48610.4 Adpositions
Mursi postpositions are monomorphemic particles suffixed with case markers.
Phonologically, they can be made of two types: simple monomorphemic monosyllabic
roots (as shown in Table 10.4 below; from tójé to rɔɲɔ) and monomorphemic roots in
disyllabic CV1CV1C shapes. Note that the syllable shapes of both types were presented
without their respective case suffixes. Some members of Mursi postpositions are relator
nouns and often occur with an oblique case extensions. Postpositions normally occur
in two forms ―as particles and as particle plus suffixes.

negation of possessionMursi, as it is dominantly a postpositional language (except sábɔ̀ ‘front’ both
postposition and preposition; wùrɛ́ɔ́ ‘behind’ prepositions), it does not correlate with
Greenberg’s Universal principle II. Both sábɔ̀ and wùrɛ́ɔ́ are multifunctional words
such as postpositions (following nouns), as adverb or ordinal number (following some
selected verbs), and as preposition (when used as time words). Thus, in relation to noun
and verb modifier, they may occur in different syntactic positions in a clause.
Greenberg’s universal principle II states that in languages with postpositions, the
487genitive always precedes the governing noun (Greenberg 1966: 45). The fact is that
Mursi is a typical postpositional language but the genitive always follows the noun.
However, Greenberg‘s principle 27 highly correlates with Mursi, it says, ‘if a language
is exclusively suffixing, it is postpositional (p.57)’.
With regard to their morphological status, it is not easy to state whether these
postpositions (other than the grammaticalized body part nouns in the form of relator
nouns) were all once independent forms or bound to nouns as the genitive case markers
on dependents.

Furthermore, as shown in (10.52), postpositions may occur with oblique markers (as in
(10.52a-d) or without them (as in (10.52e-f). The co-occurrence of postpositions and
case markers is not always clear. In (10.53a) below, at first glance, the postpositional
particle bàì looks like a verbal word. The fact is that it is not a verbal word, but it may
488be used as a lexicalized verb form ‘to sit’. Even if this is the case, in some previous
linguistic works on Southeast Surmic languages, this particle is mentioned as an
independent verbal word. The verb ‘to sit’ in Mursi can be referred to by the existential
verb íh ‘to exist/(be) present’ with three term root suppletions /changes depending on
person and number. Postpositions can be moved to a clause-initial position when they
occur with negated verbs, as in (10.53a).

Even if the repetition of bai is not clear as in (10.53b), the relational concept of ‘under

expression of the possessive NP (‘your seats’) presents additional evidence to what was
already noted above that bai can serve as the verb (secondary) only when there is no
verb dedicated to the meaning 'sit/stay/exist' in the clause. Therefore, the literal meaning
of ɓáá kɛ̀lčàɲà is ≈ (‘a place for (the purpose of) sitting’) ― (10.53c).

Here, the verb ɛ́l (‘exist.IMPERV.PL’) is prefixed with a passive marker k(V)- and
suffixed with an instrumental nominalizer marker čaɲ. Tentatively, I regard the passive
prefix form k(V)- to be the domain of the emergence of the multifunctional particle
ké/kó (preposition, instrumental, coordinative conjunction, etc.). Note that -ča is a
comitative marker with additional meaning of reason-applicative or purpose. Thus then,489in (10.53c), bàì has a unique postposition function. See further elaborations of the

With regard to the different morphological forms and syntactic position possibilities of
postpositions such that additional spatial relation specification and respective meaning
variation of them appear to be of not much significance. In spite of this solid fact, minor
semantic variations may exist when oblique case marking suffixes are directly attached
to oblique arguments and when oblique case markers attach to normal postposition
particles. For example,

meaning in (a) is, that it tells the specific place of the item. In (10.55b), the oblique case
is attached to the noun and appears in its general function. In this case, the oblique case
marker does not supply specific spatial relation information in relation to the exactness.
(10.56) has no oblique argument so the postposition follows the predicate as
complement. The postposition tójé can also mean ‘through/by’ (as in (10.56a-c).

10.5Verb-final suffixIn the attempt to understand how different grammatical constituents interact within
sentences or clauses, we shouldn't forget that some minor but important morphological491forms such as verb-final suffixes that might contribute certain pragmatic and semantic
roles in various types structures in which they occur. The verb-final suffix, an
obligatorysyntacticrequirementforaffirmativedeclarative,imperative,hortative/jussive, and negative clauses, is a morphological element that occurs often on
clause-final intransitive verbs.

which contains verb-final suffixes may be the only clausal constituent. At least in
relation to some other constituents in a clause, for obvious reasons, there will be no
constituent other than the verb which is to be made a focal element.

As shown below, the verb-final suffixes in the imperative clauses have predictable

Comparative construction is a grammatical means of showing two or more items in
order to note similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2012: 343). In order to
make a comparison between two items, there must be at least one quality (essence)
which could be used as a parameter, and that the two items share in common. In other
words, comparing of two or more items involves quality association, an indispensable
approach which would help us to understand where the difference between the items
lies or to what extent/degree the difference between the items in comparison is viable.
One cannot compare two items unless there is at least a single difference in quality
between them, thus the difference comes by means of associating the two items.
As suggested by Dixon (2012: 344), a prototypical comparative construction has
three elements ― the comparison of participants (COMPAREE and STANDARD OF
COMPARISON), the property (PARAMETER of comparison), and the INDEX of comparison.","[506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518]"
"1.2Linguistic profile of MursiThe linguistic typological profile of Mursi is similar to a certain degree to the Surmic
group languages, particularly to the Suri language. The summaries given below concern
the phonological, morphological and syntactic typological features of the language.
With respect to phonology, Mursi is a language with a fair number of phonemic
distinctions; it has a total of twenty-nine phonemes: twenty-two consonants (see Table
2.3) and seven vowels (see Table 2.6). Mursi, to a certain extent, stands apart from the
rest of the Southeastern Surmic Group languages (particularly from its closely related
languages Chai and Tirmaga), because it does not have the following consonant
phonemes: voiceless bilabial stop /p/, the palatal implosive /ʄ/, and the velar implosive
/ɠ/. The occurrence of the glottal stop is limited in all positions in a word. Due to its
limited distribution, its phonemic status is questioned by some Nilo-Saharan scholars,
but particularly by people who worked on the Southeastern language groups.
However, especially at the level of a phonological word versus a grammatical word
identification, vowels are highly complex, because Mursi vowels undergo a number of
morphophonological processes; including extensive vowel coalescence, harmony,
copying, deletion, change, subtraction and so on. The vowel copying is one of the most
widely spread and recurring morphophonological phenomenon in the language, and it
can occur as a single, double, triple, and quadruple vowel copying term (see Chapter 2;
§2.5.6.5). Vowel height harmony and vowel fronting harmony may also create a high
degree of complexity in the analysis of the properties of vowels. One similarity between
consonants and vowels is that both could have lengthened segments, but length in both
7is phonetically triggered by certain prosodic and phonological processes such as:
lengthened consonants at syllable boundaries and historical intervocalic consonant
deletion.
The maximal syllable template is CVC. A great majority of Mursi verb roots have
monosyllabic CVC shapes. Mursi has also two register tones: High and Low. Both are
contrastive and play significant roles both at the lexical and grammatical levels. It is
worth to note that grammatical tone plays a significant contrastive role in certain
morphological categories such as number, person, and mood.
In terms of morphology, Mursi has three open word classes ― verbs, nouns and
adjectives; and twelve closed word classes: pronouns, adverbs, adpositions
(postpositions and prepositions), question words, number words, quantifiers,
connectors, discourse particles, interjections, ideophones, and expressives (discussed
in detail in Chapter 3).
Mursi is an agglutinating language with some degree of fusion; it is highly synthetic
(up to seven morphemes per word). Mursi is a predominantly suffixing language. Verbs
have up to fourteen slots for verbal grammatical categories. Only a maximum of three
pre-root slots can be available for both inflectional and derivational markers to be added
to the verbal roots at a time (usually a negation marker proclitic followed by suffixes
marking subject, causative, aspect, mood and so on). Generally, as in most members of
the Surmic group languages, Mursi has few slots for prefixes. A Mursi post-verbal root
slot can host a maximum of five suffixes or a combination of both suffixes and an
enclitic. For example, verbal affixes appear roughly in the following order:
(1.1)ŋà=kó-jóg-ón-óŋ-Ø=ó-ɔ̀
NEG.IMPERV=1SU-tell-MT-2pl.OBJ-1pl.INC.SU.IMPERV=NEG-VFS
‘We (inc.) will not tell (it) to you (pl.).’Except tense, which is marked by two relative time referring particles (wa ‘recent past’;
be ‘distant past’) and by other separate time words, bound pronominals S/A and O
8arguments, aspect, mood, motion, and most valency and voice changing devices are
marked on the verb by inflection and derivation.
Morphologically, nouns can be defined as words that obligatorily inflect for number,
case, definiteness, and can occur with deictic categories. Nouns could have up to ten
affixal slots for nominal grammatical categories. There is only one pre-root slot for
deictic category and nine other post-root slots, of which four are shown by enclitics.
Number on nouns can be shown in a number of ways and by two types of morphological
forms: suffixes and clitics.
As many Nilo-Saharan languages, Mursi has a complex number marking system.
Thus nouns are divided into four sets based on how they mark number: ‘replacive’,
‘marked plural’, ‘singulative’, and ‘suppletive’. Some nouns utilize a tripartite number
marking system; ‘river’ kíɗó (singular), kíɗóì (singulative) and kíɗɛ́n (plural). A few
other nouns may utilize more than one plural suffix: ‘silver bracelet’ érésí (singular),
érésíó (plural) and/or érésíɲá (plural). Interestingly, close kinship nouns stand apart
from the rest of noun types in that they can be marked by a special plural number
marking suffix -čo. A total of about 70 portmanteau number markers are found in the
language, and all are suffixes (see Chapter 6). Nominal morphological categories
usually display the following affix-clitic orderings.

‘Those (field) watchings (vigils)’There are four morphological categories that can be encoded through double marking:
two on verbal words and two on nominal words. Of the four, two are encoded through9circumclitics (negation on verbs in the imperfective aspect and demonstrative system
on nouns). The third grammatical category, which is shown by double marking is
causative. Thus, causative derivation in Mursi can be shown by morphological markers
circumfixed directly to the verb root. The fourth grammatical category to be shown
through double marking is genitive case. It is a very rare feature in that it is the only
grammatical category in the language to be indicated by an identical marker in a
successive manner, as in (1.4)

people-RSTR
big.PL-RSTR local-GEN-GEN
‘Village elders’ (Lit. big (pl) people of the local area’)Mursi utilizes a complex aspect marking system, and aspect falls broadly into two
categories: imperfective and perfective. Roughly, aspect can be shown on verbs in the
following ways: by bound pronominal subject marking suffixes and by a number of
different verb root alternations and a morphological phenomenon. The verb root
alternation is quite complex and roughly one-third of Mursi verbs have different root
forms for imperfective and perfective aspects. This includes full suppletion, partial
suppletion, final consonant reduction/deletion, final syllable reduction, and multiple
alternation. There is also one morphological phenomenon, i.e. prefixing t(V)- onto verb
roots in the imperfective aspect (see Chapter 7; §7.3.1.2).
Mursi is a nominative-accusative language and has a canonical constituent order
AVO (for a transitive clause) and/or SV (for an intransitive clause). Core-arguments in
this constituent order are functionally-unmarked. In addition to this, depending on
clause types and pragmatic context, two other constituent orders are also utilized: an
AOV order (in negated clauses) (as in (1.5b)), and an OVA in a transitive clause and
VS in an intransitive clause where post-verbal subjects (S and A) are marked for
nominative case (as in (1.6)).","[30, 31, 32, 33]"
"452Chapter 10
10.1Grammatical RelationsIntroductionGrammatical relations in Mursi are marked by constituent order and case. According to
(König, 2006:657f.; Dixon 1994:63ff), Mursi is a multilayered language in that it
utilizes a constituent order AVO/SV (neither the A nor the S arguments can be
unmarked for nominative case) and the OVA/VS order in which post-verbal A and S
arguments are for marked-nominative case. However, case-marking is often employed
depending on the constituent order system of the language. Mursi is a nominativeaccusative language. Although Mursi utilizes case-marking, it is also a head-marking
language that has cross-referencing bound pronominal forms to indicate grammatical
relations. As a head-marking language, it has participant reference markings on the verb
which predominantly indicate grammatical relations. This operates by indexing bound
pronominal A and O argument affixes on the verb. In clauses with ditransitive verbs,
argument indexing on the verb often operates according to referential prominence scale
hierarchy and verb-adjacency constraint principles.
There is no single rigid and imperative approach of analyzing the relations of
constituents within individual languages from multiple but plausible morphogical,
syntactic and semantic approaches. This is often possible, however, if and only if the
analysis make sense for a particular instance such as to indicate relation of constituents
within a clause. And above all, if the analysis conforms to the basic grammatical
properties of the language under description. While the treatement of case marking
strategy in Mursi largely depends on syntax, the discourse prominence of arguments
such as animacy and definiteness are indispensable tools that enable us to understand
the way in which pronouns and nouns function in clauses.
453For example, free pronouns in the S or A function of the canonical constituent order
SV/AVO will in no way be marked for case, nor will it trigger any morphological
markings which may indicate the relation of constituents in a clause, whereas in a noncanonical OVA/VS constituent order, pronouns in S/A are marked for nominative case,
thus now encode further pragmatic function, i.e. focus/topic. For example, in a copular
clause, the first person plural pronoun in CS function precedes the copula verb, as is
always the case in the canonical order ―àggè kánó ‘We (exc.) are’. Or to turn this into
a question clause, the copula verb should be moved to a clause initial position, i.e. kánó
àggè? ‘Are we?’. But, to put the focus on the CS, the same pronoun but in nominative
case form will be inserted between the copular verb and the unmarked form pronoun,
as in (10.1).
(10.1)k-án-ó
1SU-COP.IMPERV-1pl.EXC.SU
‘Who are we?’àggè-ò
1pl-NOMàggè?
1plSince the copula verb is now at clause initial position, the marked-nominative pronoun
is in line with the principle of ‘‘case after the verb’’, in contrast to ‘‘no case before the
verb’’.
For what appear to be due to the morphosyntactic and pragmatic interaction of
constituents in the non-canonical order, post-verbally Mursi nominals in markednominative case form can often function as either topical-S or topical-A.
In this chapter, among many, are two major topics which have been discussed in
detail, each of them are typologically rare and could perhaps be typical features of
Mursi. These are Noun Modification Construction and marked-nominative case. The
noun modification construction system of Mursi is the bearer of genitive case, whereas
the locus of marked-nominative case and other grammatical cases that mark both core
and non-core constituents is in the canonical and non-canonical constituent orders. Thus
454this chapter of grammatical relations shall present various morphosyntactic topics
which particularly deals with constituent order (§10.2), case marking (§10.3),
postpositions (§10.4), and verb-final suffix (§10.5).
10.2 Constituent order
Mursi has three types of constituent order: canonical AVO/SV, non-canonical OVA/VS
where the A/S is marked with morphological marked-nominative case suffixes, and
non-canonical OAV (a somewhat a strict constituent order of negation). With respect
to grammatical relations, each is dealt with in subsequent sub-sections below.","[475, 476, 477, 478]"
"592Therefore in (14.55), the báns of first person imperfective form changes into third
person form bánás within the same aspect. Unless otherwise indicated by the insertion
of the vowel /a/ which overtly makes personal dexis shift from first person to third
person subject, the speech report remains open for both type of interpretations.
All other secondary speech verbs can be used in the main clause or preceding the
indirect speech complement clause. But they must be accompanied by the quotative
marker ké in complement function. The following example is repeated from (13.36b).

For obvious reasons, speech verbs other than sén are unproductive in direct speech
reports, but the speech verb jàg may be used as direct speech introducer when it is
placed after the speech report. When it does so, it does not require the quotative marker
ké ― see below:

Since the causal marker bá/ɓá has a movable nature (no fixed position in a clause), it
can appear anywhere in the subordinate clause along with the causer. As is illustrated
in (14.24), ɓá preceding the possessive NP, shows the cause which is brought on by the
causer specified in the subordinate clause ((nɔ̀ŋ) gòdínɛ̀, (lit. ‘he his brother’). The third
person singular pronoun is optional since the bound pertensive suffix -ɛ fully provides
information about the possessor person and number. Note that the verb ‘cry’ shows
aspect by adding a t(V)- prefix verb in which the imperfective form rui drops the final
vowel and becomes ru which with a perfective aspect marker t- and by copying the
vowel of the root ~ turu, ends in a consonant like most consonant-final verb roots tur.
However, if it is decomposed into further pieces *tu-r-u *<PERV-cry-3sg.SU>, it does
not make sense, so it is better to keep it as it is, i.e. tu-ru. See further examples below,
where in the majority of subordinated clauses, the subordinate clause precedes the main
clause.

thiefIn all reason clauses shown above, in addition to the grammaticalized cause marker
bá/ɓá, reason and mostly purpose indicating suffixes -ɛ, -čo, and -čaɲ have been
attached to verbs, ― either as RES/COM (reason/comitative) or APPL (applicative).
576It is quite difficult to make a distinction between reason and purpose clauses merely on
the basis of semantics.
Nevertheless, there are two possibilities by which the two can be distinguished: (i)
both purpose and reason can be indicated in the subordinate clause by ké ɓá where ké
functions as purpose marker (as in (14.26-27), and (ii) the purpose clause may be
introduced by comitative/applicative markers -ɛ, -čo, and instrumental-applicative -čaɲ.
The examples given below present the ké ɓá clauses, and both were obtained from a
short narration entitled ‘kòmà kɔ́ɗá’ about a cultural ceremony that emphasises the
distinct identity of grades and the rights and obligations of seniority and juniority. (cf.
Appendices, Text I). The following is to give readers a brief introduction to the
narrative in (14.26 and 14.27). According to the age grades stages and systems of
Mursi, the Bara (‘Elders’) who are placed at the top of the age grade hierarchy are seen
as being responsible for the socialisation of the Tɛ̀rò (‘Young men’) and the unmarried
girls. Those who are called the Rórá (‘Adult men’) are responsible for Dhonga [ɗɔ̀ŋà]
(cf. §1.6). So, according to the Mursi tradition the Tɛ̀rò and the unmarried girls take
sorghum stalks to the Bárá at the time of harvest. The Dhonga do the same for the Rórá.
The speaker in this narration is a young but married woman talking about the usual
conflict with Dhonga while they are collecting sorghum stalks occurring every each
year at the harvesting season. The underlined below are purpose-reason markers.

Besides, there is no subordination or coordination markers shown but rather the ké ɓa
is used as bridging construction. One has to remember that clauses of the above types
may have full fledged internal structure of sentences.
In (14.27), the purpose-reason clause follows a rhetorical question which as is shown
clearly seeks information.

laterThis construction is ambiguous in that it can have two interpretations ― (i) the one
shown in the actual translation, and (ii) just a single clause (‘Because they touched us
then on the road.’)
As mentioned earlier, the purpose clause can be expressed without the cause marker
particle bá/ɓá just by attaching the comitative or reason applicative marker suffixes to
verbs. Comitative and reason applicative markers in Mursi are identical. Thus the
semantics of comitative, reason (reason-applicative), and purpose clauses may be
shown by invariably identical morphological markers. Despite the fact that there is a
considerable difference between Nilo Saharan and Bantu linguistics, at the semantic
level, applicative derivation seems to cover a number of other functions in both
families. It has been noted by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2011: 53) that the term
‘applicative’ has different sub-types such as comitative, dative, and instrumental.","[598, 599, 600, 601]"
"116Chapter 3 Word classes3.1IntroductionMursi has three open word classes and twelve closed word classes. The open word
classes are: nouns (§3.2.1), verbs (§3.2.2) and adjectives (§3.2.3). The set of closed
word classes include pronouns (§3.3.1), adverbs (§3.3.2), adpositions (§3.3.3)
(prepositions and postpositions), question words (3.3.4), number words and quantifiers
(§3.3.5), connectors and discourse particles (§3.3.6), interjections (§3.3.7), ideophones
(§3.3.8), and expressives (§3.3.9). Although each word class displays their own distinct
morphological, syntactic and semantic properties, establishing a straightforward
distinctions between word classes may not be always easy. For example, some members
of the adjective class share certain morphological categories with nouns ― such as
number, demonstrative and definite. Likewise, adjectives can also share morphological
categories with verbs ― such as person, mood, valency changing derivations and
negation.
As these morphological categories do not exclusively apply to each and every
members of a particular word class, extensive morphological and syntactic criteria must
be applied in order to distinguish one from the other before making either a
characterization statement or establishing exceptions. Moreover, as suggested in
Aikhenvald (2015: 81), morphological structure and categories on one hand, and
syntactic functional slots in a clause on the other hand are among the essential criteria
for distinguishing between word classes. Apart from the two productive criteria, one
phonological criterion has been found to be a salient segmental property of verb roots
for distinguishing verbs from the rest word classes, i.e. roughly 90 percent of Mursi
verb roots end in consonants. This will be discussed in §7.2, Chapter 7. In addition,
117interjections and expressives have also a peculiar phonology quite different from other
word classes (see the last two subsequent sections of chapter 2). Therefore, this chapter
presents a detailed account of morphological and syntactic features of word classes
based on the language’s internal structure. Before embarking onto the details of each

√The syntactic functions and functional slots of the word classes listed in Table 3.1
above may be possible properties of a particular word class as a whole and only
represent general syntactic features of that particular class. However, some word classes
may have sub-classes with their own specific syntactic functions, for example, the noun
class has about five members, and each sub-classes may show some degree of
peculiarities of morphology and syntax in line with general feature of the class.
3.2 Open word classes
In the following sections, the morphological, syntactic and semantic properties of the
three open word classes of the language, nouns (§3.2.1), verbs (§3.2.2) and adjectives
(§3.2.3) are discussed.
1183.2.1 Nouns
A noun class generally includes: simple nouns, relator nouns, place names, kinship
nouns, proper names, and compound nouns. Apart from these, all other nouns can be
members of this class through various derivations mainly from verbs and adjectives.
The morphological categories that these noun types in general take (§3.2.1.1) and the
syntactic functional slots they fill in a clause (§3.2.1.2) will be discussed. Following
this, descriptions have been provided for each noun type (see §3.2.1.3). Mursi has no
grammatical gender, but a brief overview of natural gendered nouns is presented in
(§3.2.4).
3.2.1.1 Morphological categories of nouns
Morphologically, nouns can be defined as words that obligatorily inflect for number,
case, demonstrative, and definiteness. Number on nouns can be shown in a number of
ways and by two morphological forms: suffixes and clitics. There is only one pre-root
slot for deictic function and nine other post-root slots of which four are shown by
enclitics. Table 3.2 below is a schematic representation of the structure of a Mursi noun
and suffix-clitic ordering.

a time. At the same time, noun roots cannot have the same capacity in taking these
categories at once. For example, de-verbal nouns or nouns derived from verbs by the
nominalizer -a can take nominative and other case morphologies. This is not the case
for other de-verbal nouns.
Based on the morphological slots shown in Table 3.2, the morphological category
indicating the demonstrative function takes SLOT 1. The demonstrative system of Mursi
is always shown by circumclitics. That is, the demonstrative marker proclitic (SLOT 1)
always co-occurs with a two-way deictic contrast marker enclitic (SLOT 8) (see Chapter
4, §4.2.1). SLOT 2 is a noun root itself. The noun root refers to simple nouns and relator
nouns. Aside from these, the term de-verbal noun can be appropriate for all other
morphological form of nouns which co-occur with SLOT 5. On nouns that are derived
from verbs, number marking is applied after the nominalizer, as in (3.1).
(3.1)[ŋà=ɓɛ́g-á-ɲá-ìnù]NP
DEM=watch-NOMZ-PL=FAR
‘Those (field) watchings (vigils)’SLOT 3 is generally a slot for overt tripartite coding of number ― replacive, plural, and
singulative. About 70 portmanteau number marking suffixes fill this nominal slot (see
number system, Chapter 5). Apart from the noun class, some members of the adjective
class namely dimension and colour adjectives may take overt number marking (see §3.4
of this chapter, and Chapter 8).The case system which marks both core and non-core
constituents fills SLOT 4. The case marking system depends highly on constituent order.
In general, nouns can be marked for case suffixes of any type when occurring postverbally (see Chapter 10). SLOT 6 can be filled by the pertensive morphology. Only
kinship nouns take pertensive morphology.

Pertensive morphology on the kinship nouns indicates number of possessed,
possessor and person (as in (3.2b-c). The possessive pronouns can follow kinship
nouns marked by pertensive morphology usually when further grammatical
information (first person inclusive/exclusive distinction) is required, as in (3.2d).
This may also show kinship nouns that may be marked for the same category twice
― or literally on the basis of a recursive system (see Chapter 4). Furthermore, the
suffix -čo is a plural number marker that can occur only with few kinship nouns (see
Chapter 6 for a full list of-čo taking kinship nouns). As can be seen in (3.2d),
whenever a modifier follows the head within an NP, the head noun will then be
marked for modification/relator marker suffix: -a (restrictive) and -ti/-i (nonrestrictive). Therefore SLOT 7 will be filled by a modification/relator marker.
SLOTS 8-11 are clitics which will be marked on nouns occurring in NPs and clauses.","[139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"

Note that the semantics role of the post-verbal nɔ̀ŋ in (10.20a and b) are different, where
the free pronoun nɔ̀ŋ in (10.22a) is due to speaker’s occasional use when referring to
kinship nouns without optional modifying possessive pronouns. Or otherwise there may
be similar constructions with (b) ʤɔ̀ɔ̀nɛ̀-á n=ɛ̀nɛ̀ <mother-RSTR SG.PSD=3SG.PSR> ‘his
mother’ or simply a pertensive form ʤɔ̀ɔ̀nɛ̀. Such occurrence of free pronouns in the
expression of possession with kinship nouns seems to be common in languages that
have no grammatical gender. So nɔ̀ŋ in (a) is part of the indirect object/dative
construction, or it is within the role of the semantic recipient. On the other hand, nɔ̀ŋ in
(10.22b) is a direct object or it is a semantic theme.
The other interesting point seems to be regarding the coding of core arguments on
ditransitive verbs, in which ditransitive verbs themselves divide into two types. Mursi
ditransitive verbs are: áʤ ‘give’ jóg ‘tell’ and ɗól ‘show, announce’. Despite the fact
that languages employ different strategies for these verbs (cf. Dixon 1994: 120), all of
them have three core roles in Mursi. The ditransitive áʤ ‘give’. ― (i) The bound object
pronominal form of the recipient (if human recipient) is cross-referenced on the verb
and the gift as peripheral argument without being coded by postposition or case markers
(e.g. 10.19). (ii) The bound object pronominal form of the gift/theme (human
patient/affected) is cross-referenced on the verb following differential object marking
while the recipient is placed as peripheral argument coded by no overt postposition or
case marker (e.g. 10.20a-b). (iii) Only the subject in A function (the agent role) is cross467referenced on the verb while the gift is placed in O function and the recipient (if human)
is placed as peripheral argument by suffixing a motion towards marker (dative) on the
verb (e.g. 10.22a-b). The verb áʤ does not take a benefactive suffix like the other two
ditransitive verbs. Moreover, it undergoes a three term root suppletion for aspect while
jóg and ɗól do not alter their roots for aspectual distinction. When two semantic roles
of the O arguments follow this verb, free ordering is possible as long as the recipient is
human, as in (10.23a-b).

On the other hand, the ditransitive verbs jog (with core roles ‘message’ and

take both motion towards and benefactive suffixes to encode either or both O

3.SBJV-go-3sg.SU10.2.2 Non-canonical OVA/VS
The non-canonical constituent order OVA/VS is the sole order that brings an overt case
marking scenario to the language, i.e. the marked-nominative. Cross-linguistically,
marked-nominative is a rare case system mainly found in African languages. König
(2008: 138) reported that marked-nominative case system are an almost unique African
469phenomenon, which is only attested in few languages outside Africa. A commonly
known scenario in a marked-nominative system is to treat/mark S and A the same way
and treating the O differently. Whatsoever is the constituent order it occurs in, the O is
in no way morphologically marked. The O always has the same form (citation/basic
form). Straighwardly, the marked-nominative case system of Mursi operates based on
an OVA/VS constituent order. Thus post-verbal subjects in this constituent order are
morphologically and formally marked by marked-nominative case suffixes.
Since this section is about the case system of the language, I prefer to mention two
terms from de Hoop and Malchukov (2008: 567) who also outlined two basic functions
of case marking ― identifying function and distinguishing function. Accordingly, the
identifying function of case encodes internal properties of the arguments, whereas the
distinguishing function of case encodes and depends on the relation between the
arguments. The former is used more in case morphology to encode specific
semantic/pragmatic information about the nominal argument in question (p.567ff.). For
example, the noun with nominative case in (10.26) is an agent [+control, +volitional,
etc.].

man-NOMAs de Hoop and Malchukov (2008: 568) put it: ‘‘the distinguishing strategy is a more
specific strategy that is used for distinguishing between the two core arguments of a
transitive clause, that is, the subject and the object’’. Example (10.26) above is a
transitive clause thus it has two core arguments. Therefore, case has marked one of the
arguments, the post-verbal subject is case-marked to avoid argument ambiguity. If the
two arguments are already cross-referenced on the verb, one may of course ask why is
the case marking in (10.26) important. The simplest answer is; what if the object470argument in (10.26) is a noun or third person pronoun? This is due to the fact that when
the object equals the subject in animacy and defineteness (as in (10.27), then the
nominative case becomes the only way to distinguish the actual subject.

Table 2.11. Phonological properties of clitics and affixes
2.9 Special phonology
Interjections, ideophones and expressives may have forms that are quite different from
the regular internal phonological properties of words, especially with regard to syllabic
structure. As we recall from §2.3.3 and §2.3.7, Mursi has neither consonant length nor
113vowel length. However, phonetic length of both types exist in the language. The former
type is trigged by gemination whereas the latter is due to an intervocalic consonant
deletion. Contrary to this, we may find that the consonant and vowel lengths
interjections, ideophones and expressives are not phonetic neither. Table 2.12
demonstrates the peculiar sound and sound patterns displayed in interjections,
ideophones and expressives.

Table 2.12. Phonology of interjections, ideophones and expressivesFor example, in Table 2.11 above, expressives can easily be recognized by having
simple monosyllabic patterns composed of C1VC2 (CVʃ ) shapes (where C2 stands for
voicless postalveolar fricative [ʃ]). There are no such phonological restrictions on any
other types of word classes as to what a word must include or exclude at the wordfinal positions.
2.10 Female register
There are quite rare and peculiar differences between female and male speech registers
in Mursi. The speech registers in Mursi happen mainly due to physiological effects in
speech production. It is a peculiar instance in which Mursi's female or male speech
114production physiological organs are partially affected by their traditional practices such
as body beautification, body scarification, and body ornamentation. Yigezu (2001:203)
has noted two traditional practices in the Chai people: (i) the lip-plate piercing tradition,
which was imperative for any girl attending puberty, but currently is optional tradition
being practiced by girls of the same age; (ii) the cultural practice of removing the lower
incisors in both ― female and male. Like the Chai society, the Mursi have similar
traditions traditional practiced by both sex groups. In terms of typological similarities,
there is no language closer to Mursi than Chai.
In Chai, as Yigezu (2001: 208) noted, three possible strategies are employed in
compensating for the loss of the lower lip: (i) place of articulation is maintained if the
manner changes, (ii) manner of articulation is maintained if the point of articulation
changes, and (iii) both the place and the manner of articulation change. Yigezu has also
mentioned three consonant changes happen based on the three ways of compensating
for the loss of the lower lip: (i) Strategy I ― [b] > {β}, [ɓ] > {w} and [β] > {ф, (ii)
Strategy II ― [b] > [d], [ɓ] > [ɗ], [s] > {θ}, [p] > [t] and [m] > [ŋ], and (iii) Strategy
III ― [b] > [ð].
In Mursi, as shown in these Categories, the alveolar fricatives /s/ and /z/ can undergo
a simplification process to their dental allophone counterparts [θ] and [ð]. The voiceless
alveolar fricative /s/ becomes [θ] word-initially and intervocalically (Strategy I)
whereas its voiced counterpart /z/ becomes [ð] intervocalically (Strategy III): /s/→ [θ]
/ {#__ or V__V} (/sízzì/→[θízzì] ‘three’, /kásáj/→[káθáj] ‘sand’; and /z/ → [ð]/ V__V
(§2.5.4). Strategy I is directly associated to Mursi‘s lenition rule, in which,
intervocalically, the voiced bilabial stop /b/ lenites to the voiced labial fricative [β] and
the bilabial glide [w]. The general morphological process that explains lenition of /b/
intervocallically is called intervocalic spirantization; and has a rule: /b/ → [β/w]/ V__V115(see §2.5.3). The rule that governs Strategy III is available in §2.5.4. Similar to Chai,
in Mursi the production of the following consonant sounds are partially affected by the
lower lip piercing tradition (cf. Yigezu 2001: 203-221; 2005: 241-257; Lüpke (2010:
6ff.); see also §1.7.3.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"

D,I,+,O2.4Syllable structureThe maximal syllable template is CVC. A great majority of Mursi verb roots have
monosyllabic CVC shapes. Just very few monosyllabic verbs may optionally contain
CVC1(C2), where C1 stands for the liquids and nasals ― gɛ̀rs ‘bad’ and báns ‘fly, stand
up’. Apart from these two, four other basic syllable shapes have been identified: V, VC,
CV, and CVV. Of these, the CV is the most frequently occurring syllable shape in the
language. The distribution of CVV syllable shape is very much limited, only confined
to few words containing phonetic vowel length (see §2.3.7). Some discourse particles,
interjections, and ideophones may contain syllable shape which are quite different from
those of regular word classes, for example ɪmm ‘no (disagreement marker)’ and ɪɲɲ
‘yes (disagreement marker)’ (see also §2.3.3). This is, however, the norm with
discourse markers and ideophones. Deviation in the syllable shapes of small and closed
word classes is often triggered when liquid and nasal consonants occurring at the coda
position.
2.5Phonological processesMursi has most complex sound processes which touch on almost every aspect of the
grammar. Although some sound changes may be irregular as they pass through a
number of phonological processes, the majority of the sound changes often have rules
by which they are governed. Some may seem common and areal. For example, many
of the word-final consonant deletion rules typically apply to both Southeastern as well
as Southwestern Surmic languages. Quite a few of the common phonological processes
are specific to the individual language thus only apply to Mursi. Therefore the
subsequent sections provide detailed account of the phonological processes which
occur in simple words as well as in morphologically-complex forms.","[99, 100]"
"5.7 Predicative possessive construction
A possessive relationship can be established within a clause, in the form of predicative
possession (Aikhenvald 2013: 27). Predicative possessive construction in Mursi can be
expressed by the verb lɔ̀m ‘have/hold/grab’ (§5.7.1), existential verb íh ‘exist’(§5.7.2),
and an invariable copula verb á <COP.3.IMPERV> (for both singular/plural) (§5.7.3).
5.7.1 With the verb lɔ̀m ‘have’
The verb lɔ̀m ‘have’ is a transitive verb, has no perfective form and can never be used
in command and passive constructions. A possessive construction produced with the
help of this verb may be translated as in English ― RA have/hold/grasp DO (cf. Dixon2422010: 299) (where subject of the transitive verb lɔ̀m (A) is the same as the possessor
(R); and the object (O) is the same as the possessed (D)). The possessed noun can be
any simple or derived noun or any possessable object in O slot.

5.7.2 With the existential verb ih ‘exist/present’
The verb of existence has four different roots, each of which comes carrying a
grammatical information such as person and aspect. What makes the existential verb
different from the verb ‘have’ is that the verb ‘exist’ is an intransitive verb used with D
in S function, and then the R becomes a peripheral NP often marked by the
preposition/comitative particle kó ‘with’ or oblique case marker -ɔ/-je attached to D. A
positive existential possessive predication will have the following schema: D exists
with R or D exists for R, as in (5.46-5.49).

5.7.3 Using a copula verb
Possessive relationships can be expressed with a copular construction (Dixon 2010:
302; Aikhenvald 2013: 29). The copula verb in Mursi inflects for person and number,
and alters its root form for aspect. However, a possessive relationship through a copula
construction can only be shown by one specific copula verb form, i.e. the third person
imperfective form á <COP.3SG/PL.IMPERV>. Accordingly, a possessive relationship
construction using this copula verb may yield the schema: D (copula subject) COPULA
VERB R (copula complement).","[265, 266, 267, 268]"
"341But if a hortative/jussive mood is used to give a command and request at the same time,
that requires a hortative/jussive answer, a copula comes at the beginning of a sentence.
Just for the purpose of Mursi grammar, I labeled the function of this copula as
‘anticipatory request-reply’ marker, as in (7.56).

Finally, there are still a few verbs that do not distinguish between singular and plural

indicate number.

Commands can be directed at first person (‘me’, ‘us’) and third person (‘him’, ‘her’,
(7.57)‘them’) (Aikhenvald 2010: 47). Commands directed at first person are known as
hortative §7.3.1.3.2, while those that are directed at third person are known as jussive
§7.3.1.3.3. In Mursi, both constitute the irrealis mood.
7.3.1.3.2 Hortative
The hortative in Mursi is a non-canonical imperative mood directed towards first person
and can be used to denote a mild command. As seen on Table 7.31, hortative is part of
the irrealis mood and only utilizes a perfective verb root. This is due to the fact that the
irrealis in general signals some degree of completeness while on the other hand the
basic assumption of the imperfective aspect signals incompleteness. The hortative form
takes a low-toned prefix k(V̀ )- and is optionally preceded by a free form high-tonedhólóʔ ‘music’ refers to song and dance (cultural form of singing and dancing) and it is a noun, while
čólló ‘sing’ only refers the action of singing and dancing (it is a verb).
53342hortative particle aj [aɲ]. As in many verbal inflectional prefixes of Mursi, the vowel
of the prefix k(V̀ )- is copied from a consonant-initial perfective verb root's vowel. The
hortative template is illustrated below.

root (for first person) and after inclusive/exclusive markers (for both first person plural).
The verb-final suffix -ɛ is often suffixed to plural forms.

Negation on hortative is marked in the same way as on the canonical imperative forms.
The difference is that the verb turns into imperfective aspect when negated, as can be
shown by the negative hortative template below.

As it is illustrated in (7.60a-c) above, the particle aj/aɲ has no function in the negative
hortative construction. Thus, it is excluded from all types of non-canonical negative
imperative constructions. The distinction between the two hortative particles aj and aɲ
is not clear at this stage (also occurring with jussive forms) but both forms seem to be
associated with the idiolect and stylistic preference of speakers.

However, there is viable evidence that both hortative and jussive forms which take
aj/aɲ particles tend be used for polite requests other than orders or commands. Besides,
in a rare instances, a verb tends be uninflected for person in a hortative form but can be
344inflected for person when it is in a jussive form. When such instances occur, the person
can be shown by a personal pronoun function as in O function or an associative word
kàrì ‘together, with’ may be used. Compare the following hortative forms (7.62a-b) and
jussive forms in (7.62c-d).

The first person plural hortative form in (7.62b) does not distinguish between inclusive
and exclusive. As we have seen in (7.51), imperative use of a morphologically deficient
verb or of a verb whose semantic origin is a non-verbal, tend to behave differently when
used in imperatives. The reduplicated kɔ́bkɔ́b ‘quick’ is a derived adverb from the verb
root kɔb ‘to follow’, has a secondary function as a verb ‘hurry’. It doesn’t take any
verbal inflection in its reduplicated form. Neither indicates aspect or number. As shown
below in (7.63b-c), the first person singular and plural hortative forms are
indistinguishable.

verb in the hortative mood form in (7.65a), keme, is exactly similar in form to the second
person subjunctive forms, ― because second person subjective verb forms tend to
reduce either their final segment or syllable; me is a perfective subjunctive form of a

7.3.1.3.3 Jussive
The jussive mood refers to a command directed at the third person. Jussive and
hortative moods of Mursi are similar in many ways except for the following
properties of the jussive:
(i)the jussive mood marker prefix k(V)- always carries a low-toned melody,(ii)the jussive marker prefix (k(V)-) will not be marked when the negated form
is used,(iii)number will not be marked on the singular form of the jussive mood while
number can be shown on the singular of the negative jussive form, and(iv)the singular of the negative jussive form may take the verb-final suffix of
the non-imperative moods, i.e. -ɔ̀, whereas the plural of the negative jussive
form takes the common verb-final suffix of the non-canonical imperative
forms, i.e. -ɛ.","[364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370]"

complementizers in indirect speech complement clauses. In particular, the secondary

"2.3.5.2 Close-mid vowels /e/ and /o/
Like the high vowels, the close-mid vowels /e/ and /o/ occur in all environments. Both
can occur in clitics, with or without a consonant ― but both occur in one particular
type of morpheme, i.e. an enclitic. For example, in subordinate marker enclitic =jè
[=è], the negator enclitic =ó and the floating emphatic enclitic =so. Vowel
assimilation related to the close-mid back vowel /o/ is frequent, and thus it assimilates
to the open-mid back vowel /ɔ/ (see §2.5.6.3 of this chapter).
722.3.5.3 Open-mid vowels /ɛ/ and /ɔ/
These two open-mid vowels occur in all positions in a word. Both occur in affixes but
only the open-mid front vowel /ɛ/ can occur in clitics ― as in gòdín=gɛ̀
<brother=PERT.PL.3.PSR> ‘their brother’. Both vowels may involve in certain type of
phonological assimilations for specific harmonic features such as fronting and height.
For example, in some instances, the open-mid back vowel /ɔ/ can spread to the left and
triggers vowel lowering of the preceding vowel. By doing this, it harmonizes with the
preceding vowel in tongue height (also known as vowel height harmony), as in (2.24).

1SU-eat-1sg.SU.IMPERV-VFS
‘I eat’
Here, the verb-final suffix -ɔ̀ has harmonized in height with the first person singular(2.24)subject suffix -i.
2.3.5.4 The low (open) vowel /a/
The low-(open) vowel /a/ is the only vowel phoneme that can occur in almost all
environments including in proclitics and enclitics, for example, the bound deictic
circumclitics ŋà=…=á and the negative imperfective proclitic ŋà=. Across morpheme
boundaries, left to right, the open vowel /a/ usually harmonizes in height with non-high
(close) vowels (see section under vowel assimilation, §2.5.6.4).

"2.3.7 Vowel length
Vowel length in Mursi is phonetic, not phonemic. Vowel length is the outcome of a
historical intervocalic consonant deletion. Despite it being undoubtedly a prototypical
member of the Southeastern Surmic Group language, Mursi deviates from the other
languages of the group in one aspect, i.e. its trisyllabic words frequently undergo
extensive intervocalic consonant deletion (see §2.5.1.2). For example, in Mursi kààrì
‘eye’ is a disyllabic word in a V.V sequence. However, the same word in other
Southeastern Surmic group languages is trisyllabic ― kaβari Suri (Chai/Tirmaga),
kābārèc (Me’en), and kárbo (Koegu/Muguji). In addition to these, there are also a
handful of vowel length instances that are randomly found in some monosyllabic words
74and ideophones. Inasmuch as vowel length in words whose trisyllabic root forms
contracted to disyllabic forms is phonetic, the vowel length that occurs in these words
and ideophones is also phonetic. Words with phonetic vowel length include ʃɛ̀ɛ̀ ‘well’,
tíí ‘always’, èè ‘yes’, and óó ‘or’ and so on. Interestingly, they are all monosyllabic.","[97, 98]"
"8.6 Summary
Like nouns and verbs, adjectives constitute an open word class. Two underived and
about one hundred fifty derived adjectives have been attested in Mursi. The source for
the majority of derived adjectives are stative verbs. Some derived adjectives may
belong to more than one word class. Adjectives differ from nouns and adjectives in a
number of ways (an illustrative summary is given below in Table 8.10).

By looking at these examples, Nilotists may argue that the suffix -óna is the same suffix
which is used for marking motion towards (ventive). A plausible answer for this is that
Mursi utilizes different morphs on imperfective and perfective verb roots to mark
motion towards the deictic center: long or short forms (-áná/-ónó; -án/-ón) on
imperfective verb roots and just -a/-o on perfective verb roots. In contrast, all verb roots
in (7.124a-b) and (7.125a-b) are in perfective aspect. So -óna cannot be a marker of
motion. In (7.125b), the suffix -ɛ is a valency increasing/applicative suffix regularly
occurring with imperfective verbs such as ‘come’ and ‘go’ ― kúún-ɛ́
<1SU.come.IMPERV-> (‘I bring’) or kɔ́-kɔ́-ɛ́ <1SU-go.IMPERV-VT/TR> (‘I take’). The
other interesting observation from the above subsecutive constructions is that the last
verb can never be marked with -óna as it is the morphosyntactic canonicality designator
of the imperative and hortative/jussive moods.","[403, 404]"
"1623.3.2.1 Manner adverbs
The subclass which consists of manner adverbs have members of derived and nonderived forms. Forms such as čùmùnò and čàllìnò are adjectives derived from verbs.
For this specific subclass of adverbs, the process of deriving adverbs from adjectives
as well as from other word classes varies.
(3.88)(STATIVE) VERB
MEANING
a. čùmùnò
čùmùn
čùmùn
‘cheerfully, happily’
b. čàllìnò
čàllì
čàll
‘well’
c. kɔ́bkɔ́b
__
kɔ́b
‘quickly’
In (3.88), čùmùnò is derived from the adjectival form čùmùn. The adjectival form itself
ADVERBADJECTIVEis a stative verb like many other derived adjectives. Morphologically, adjectives are
much closer to adverbs than any other word class. So in the above case it is quite
appropriate and plausible to say that (3.88a) is derived from the adjective form rather
than from the stative one. In addition, example (3.88b) also strengthens this statement,
that čàllìno is not directly derived from the stative verb root, rather it is from the
adjectival stem. There are instances where adverbs are derived from active verb roots
through reduplication (as in (3.88c) ― kɔ́bkɔ́b <follow.follow> ‘quickly’ > kɔ́b
‘follow’.
Table 3.8 below shows a list of manner adverbs.

Interestingly, adverbs which share identical meaning with adjectives may distinguish
themselves by form. For example, the adverb ʃàù (3.89d) has semantically equivalent
adjectival form, i.e. tìrì (3.90).

semantically as well as syntactically. One instance in which such problem arises is
when an adjectival form carrying the adverbializer suffix is used in the comparative

fast-N.S-ADV same/like plane asAs we recall from §3.2.1.3.8, the suffix -tin is a nominalizer, which is used to derive
deverbal nouns from stative verb roots that denote state of affairs (nouns of state). In
(3.91), it is more of an adverb than an adjective because the adverbializer marker -o is
attached to it. On the other hand, it is an adjective because it denotes the manner of how
the comparee and the standard are fast. However, such specific case is confined to only164one type of comparative construction ― ‘as…as’ or ‘the same…as’. Literally, (3.91)
can also mean ‘(a/the) long car is fast like as plane.’ (see also Chapter 12).
3.3.2.2 Time adverbs
Time adverbs in Mursi are tense markers. Since tense in Mursi is typically expressed
by separate lexical time words, time word are used as temporal adverbs. Time referring
adverbs constitute the largest of all subclasses of adverbs. A few of them share one
morphological aspect with some locative adverbs and demonstratives pronouns, i.e.
they take bound deictic demonstrative circumclitics (ŋà=…=á/=ùnù). As in the
following examples, the adverbs in (3.92) and (3.93) are comprised of mɛ́á ‘now’ and
mɛ́árɛ́ ‘immediately, right now’ on one hand and the bound demonstrative circumclitics
on the other hand.

Time adverbs/temporal adverbs are elaborated in depth in §7.3.1.4.
(3.94)3.3.2.3 Frequency and degree adverbs
In Mursi, adverbs of frequency are one that indicate how often something/an action
happens. Some of frequency and degree referring adverbs are at least semantically
165subclass-crossing ones. This means, they are partly temporal adverbs because the
frequency happenings or actions cannot be specified outside a temporal reference (see
also §7.3.1.4.3).

3.3.2.4 Emphatic, intensifiers, epistemic adverbs
Mursi emphatic and intensification inferring adverbs may also be used in adjectival
function. They usually occur clause-finally. The first five adverbs in Table 3.10 have
emphatic or intensifying functions. The same emphatic and intensifiers can also be used
in modification of adjectives. They either describe/modify the quality of the action or166emphasise or amplify the action referred to by the verb. Unlike the two, epistemic
inferring adverbs can occur clause-initially and clause-finally. They may be used when
an information is believed to contain some hidden facts, possibilities, or information
that creates an exclamative or dubious situation. They also commonly occur in
information questions that require verification (see §12.3).

The distinction among húŋ, háŋ and wáŋ is not always clear. In order to check if there
(3.99)any significant differences exist among these three, there is one productive way to find
out. The emphatic húŋ is the only one that can modify the existential verb íh ‘exist,

‘The woman who is collecting the wood.’In (4.78), apart from the non-restrictive nature of the relative clause, the noun itself is
restricted by the deictic inflection. No further restricting element or specific descriptor
can come between the NP and the relative pronoun, but it is possible to add new
information after the relative clause. Therefore the modifier that comes after the
restrictive clause may serve to add new information or draw attention (=who is the
woman?; then what about her?).

GodAs illustrated in (4.79), the NP which is indicated by the 3sg subject refers to anyone
who has never seen God in whatsoever. The relative pronoun marked with the nonrestrictive suffix doesn’t help the relative clause restrict the referent's identity, but it
rather indicates that the referent is not specific. For easier distinction between restrictive
and non-restrictive relative clauses, compare the following examples ― restrictive in
(4.80) and non-restrictive (4.81).

As can be seen from the examples above, the major difference between the two
(4.80)depends on the semantic types that they convey. In other words, the semantic218difference between the two comes from the relative markers that operate on NPs and
on verbs in the RC. In (4.80), the head noun is marked by a restrictive relative suffix a while the head noun in (4.81) is marked by a non-restrictive relative suffix -ti. In
(4.80), the referent (érmìa ‘the boy’) and his whereabout is known. So the information
provided about the referent is not new. Anybody who heard the background
information about the stolen clothes now can understand that this boy lives in the
village. In contrast, in (4.81) the referent is a certain boy (érmìtì ‘a boy’), and adds
new information to an already-known background information (it could be an existing
suspicion).","[240, 241, 242]"

14.2.3.2 The syntactic role of direct and indirect speech verbs
It is always important to distinguish the syntactic role of the secondary speech verbs
whenever they occur within direct speech reports. Speech verbs introducing both direct
and indirect speech reports may occur in direct speech report clauses. In such a
scenario, indirect speech report introducer verbs always become part of the clause that
introduces the direct speech. Both direct and indirect speech reporting verbs
coordinated by clausal coordinative conjuction nà and share the same current speaker.
