"1.5.1 A note on the use of glosses
The problem of choosing appropriate glosses for morphemes is a thorny one and
the solution adopted in this grammar may not be the best one.
Where a given
morpheme fulfils one function or a few very closely related functions, there
is no problem and we may use a consistent gloss.
Thus, the verbal prefix eis simply a subject number marker (dual) and never performs another function.
Often, however, what is clearly one and the same morpheme has various functions
and the question arises whether we should use different glosses accordingly.
If we do so in principle, then the further question is how different the
This is
individual functions have to be for us to choose different glosses.
where the difficulty lies.
Thus, the verbal suffix -na agrees with benefactives and possessors and these two functions could arguably be indicated by
different glosses.
On the other hand, the case marker -m has a host of
functions (7.3) the central one of which is that of goal marker.
Other
functions are more or less closely related to the one of goal marking and there
seems to be no non-arbitrary cut-off point for introducing new glosses. Besides
goal, -m marks recipients and benefactives, which may be regarded as goals,
objects that actually are goals, but it also functions as a disambiguator,
marking all [+~uman]objects.
It seems best to use just one gloss for all
these cases.
This has the additional advantage that we do not have to invent
glosses for those occurrences of -m where its function is entirely opaque (for
examples see chapter 7).
Therefore, one gloss is normally used for a given morpheme throughout this
grammar. Where this results in total obscurity, the reader is referred to the
index, which provides references to the appropriate places, where the functions
of these morphemes are discussed. Occasionally, and possibly inconsistently, I
have abandoned the principle of 'one gloss per morpheme'. Thus, the goal marker
sometimes substitutes for the locative marker and in this function it is
glossed accordingly (i.e. LQC); or the suffix - i a has the two distinct
functions of marking location and cause and it is glossed according to itsp a r t i c u l a r f u n c t i o n a s e i t h e r UX: o r CAU.
Apart from such minor exceptions,
however, t h e p r i n c i p l e of 'one g l o s s p e r morpheme' has been maintained

"2.3.2.4High vowel centralisingIn addition to the vowels so far discussed there are two others, namely two
high, mid, rounded and unrounded vowels, whose status within the phonemic
system is problematic.
These vowels are largely confined to 0, the corresponding vowels for Y being the high, unrounded front or rounded back vowels.
Auditorily, the difference between the centralised and the non-centralised
variants is quite marked and seems bigger than between certain other vowels in
the system such as /a/ and /S/.
It appears to be impossible to specify a
conditioning environment for the occurrence of the central vowels.
Here are some examples:

pig chaseThe feature of high central vowels is one of many that is associated with
adulthood.
It is acquired fairly late in life, sometime during adolescence.
Young boys never have it but on approaching adulthood they start acquiring this
feature.
As is to be expected, this acquisition is a slow process, starting
with some items and then gradually spreading to all relevant ones. Furthermore,
adolescents do not necessarily start with the same items and a fair bit of
variation has been observed (no worthwhile data are at hand for women).
The
following anecdote shows that the high vowel variation may not be entirely
confined to the subconscious level: a young man was asked to give the equivalent of the English t r e e .
Spontaneously, he volunteered t i with a clear high
However, after a few moment's reflection he offered
front vowel, i.e. [ t i 1.
the following comment: ""Well, [ t i ] does not sound too good, it should be [ t i I"".
In order to shed more light on the social correlate of the high central vowels,
more statistical material would be required than I collected; therefore, I
leave the discussion at these few remarks.

Another question worth considering is the phonemic status of these vowels.

"1.5Organisation o f t h e grammarThe emphasis of t h i s grammar i s on t h e morphosyntactic s t r u c t u r e s of the
language.
However, a s t h e sound system of Imonda, o r any other Waris language
f o r t h a t matter, has never been described, I have included a brief treatment of
t h i s i n chapter 2.
Chapter 3 e s t a b l i s h e s t h e p a r t s of speech on a language i n t e r n a l , morphos y n t a c t i c basis.
With t h e exception of verbs, which a r e discussed i n chapter
5, t h e formal p r o p e r t i e s of t h e c l a s s e s thus established a r e examined i n some
d e t a i l and r e l a t e d t o semantic p r o p e r t i e s .
Chapter 4 discusses t h e i n t e r n a l s t r u c t u r e of t h e noun phrase ( N P ) and aspects
of i t s functions i n t h e clause.
Three types of functions of the NP may be
distinguished: semantic, s y n t a c t i c and pragmatic.
The only pragmatic
function t h a t i s discussed i n d e t a i l i s t h a t of t o p i c marking.
Since not
only N P s but a l s o clauses c a n ' r e c e i v e t o p i c marking, t h i s i s given a unified
treatment i n chapter 9 , p a r t of which i s devoted t o inter-clausal r e l a t i o n s .
P a r t of chapter 7 i s devoted t o the question of whether c e r t a i n types of NPs
might have a s p e c i f i c s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n t o the predicate.
The conclusion
reached t h e r e i s t h a t we can s i n g l e o u t t h e s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n s of subject
and object.
These a r e t h e core N P s of the clause which a r e s y n t a c t i c a l l y
s p e c i f i c a l l y handled and whose semantic r e l a t i o n t o t h e predicate i s not
o v e r t l y indicated but d i c t a t e d by t h e semantics of t h e predicate i t s e l f .
In
opposition t o these two types of NPs a r e t h e peripheral N P s which do not stand
i n a p a r t i c u l a r s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n t o t h e predicate and whose semantic r e l a t i o n
t o t h e predicate is o v e r t l y indicated by one of a s e r i e s of case c l i t i c s .
These case c l i t i c s a r e a l s o discussed i n chapter 4.
The connection between t h a t section of chapter 4 t h a t d e a l s with case marking
(4.3) and t h a t s e c t i o n of chapter 7 t h a t d e a l s with t h e s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n s of
NPs t o the predicate (7.1) i s a close one.
This connection i s f u r t h e r accentuated by the f a c t t h a t t h e case c l i t i c -m has both s y n t a c t i c and semantic
functions.
S y n t a c t i c a l l y it functions a s an object marker while semantically
it i s a goal marker and a s such functions a s a marker of peripheral NPs. This
p a r t i c u l a r case c l i t i c could both be described i n chapter 4 and chapter 7,
However, a u n i f i e d d e s c r i p t i o n i s

The most i n t e r e s t i n g adjuncts a r e those where we can a c t u a l l y witness the

In t h i s example n6f i s t h e object of f e and t h e case-marked NP (ne) i s the

Instead
t h e o b j e c t agreement markers a r e used.
This means t h a t t h e former object of

"systematic analysis of discourse is outside the scope of this grammar.
However, certain phenomena of grammar cut across the traditionally strict
division between sentence and discourse level.
Thus, topicalised clauses
have 'sentential' and 'discourse' functions -anda complete account of this
phenomenon cannot be given without appealing to discourse.
Topic clauses
with sentential functions are contrastive topics and correspond to adverbial
clauses in English.
Those with discourse function are resumptive topics.
They 'summarise' the information contained in the previous clause and present
it as a topic, that is, as a framework against which the subsequent clause
needs to be interpreted. These resumptive topics simply provide a backreference to the preceding clause, provide discourse cohesion and cannot be
said to be subordinate to the following clause.
This pattern is well known
from Philippine languages (also from New Guinea languages).
AFormally, topic clauses are marked by a suffix on the verb.
The same suffix
may also mark adverbial and NP 'topics,both clause-internal and clauseexternal topics.
Topic marking might therefore be described at least at
three different levels, namely clause, sentence and discourse.
However, what
is clearly one and the same phenomenon needs to be given a unified treatment
and this is provided in chapter 9.","[12, 13]"
