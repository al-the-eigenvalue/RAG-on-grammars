Although the symmetrical structure of a verbless clause may cause it to appear as though
the clause-final particle simply shifts position, that this is indeed a cleft/movement
construction can be shown by the position of a copula in an appositive copula clause
under leftward constituent focus marking: (364) shows that the copula follows the left306Hdislocated marked focus, while (365) shows that the copula cannot occur clause-finally

SPRX.IND DECL 1.SG-GEN look-NZR:RLS person=COP.PFV9.4.2. Predicative cleft/focus construction
A predicative cleft/focus construction derives its basic structure from the
appositive focus construction described in §9.4.1, and again consists of two major surface
308Hconstituents, the marked focus and the presupposed topic. However, a predicative
431cleft/focus construction is based underlyingly on a multi-constituent predicative clause;
the surface, two-constituent appositive structure of the cleft/focus construction thus
interacts with the underlyingly multi-constituent predicative clause structure in a number
of ways.
First, the predicate of a predicative cleft/focus construction undergoes obligatory
nominalization by one of the “Primary” nominalizers -nà ‘NZR:SUB’, -nam
‘NZR:RLS/NSUB’, -há ‘NZR:IRR’, or -kò ‘NZR:LOC/OBL’ (§15.2). The nominalized predicate
309Hthen stands as the core constituent of the clause topic; it may be uninflected/stem-based
(366) or inflected (367) (see §15 for definitions of these types).

The focus particle describes a clear boundary between the marked focus and thetopic. This is relatively easy to see in examples like (366)-(367), in which both the
304H304Hmarked focus and the topic contain only a single internal constituent. When more than
one constituent of the underlying predicative clause is included in the surface structure,
they may be treated either as marked focus constituents, or as topic constituents. In most
cases, underlying predicative clause constituents will retain whatever marking they would
have taken in the underlying predicative clause – for example, O arguments will (when
definitely referential) be marked in the Accusative, and Adverbials will (when derived) be
marked by an adverbializing enclitic, etc. However, underlying predicative clause
subjects are zero-marked if and only if they occur inside the marked focus (368).
3045HUnderlying predicative clause subjects which are treated as topic constituents are
obligatorily in the Genitive (369).

It is not entirely clear why a non-focused constituent of an underlying predicativeclause can occur within either the marked focus or the topic of a predicative cleft/focus
construction, or whether there is a significant pragmatic difference between one or the
other grouping strategy (there is certainly no semantic difference). Although one might
speculate that the First person plural referent constitutes a secondary focus in a sentence
such as (368), while not at all under focus in (369), this cannot at present be demonstrated
3047H3048Hwith any certainty.
Choice of predicate nominalizer in a predicative cleft/focus construction is
generally determined by the underlying grammatical relation of the marked focus to the
nominalized predicate; that is, a focused underlying subject will tend to select for a
subject nominalizer -nà ‘NZR:SUB’, while a focused underlying O argument will tend to
select for a non-subject nominalizer -nam ‘NZR:NSUB’ (cf. §15.3.2). However, variation of
3049Hthe nominalizer is also possible, and may yield subtle and intriguing differences of
interpretation – particularly in interrogative cleft/focus constructions. For example, (370)305H(371) are a minimal interrogative clause pair in which the predicate is nominalized in -nà
3051H‘NZR:SUB’ in the first example and in -kò ‘NZR:LOC/OBL’ in the second. The denotation of
the two sentences is basically identical; however, note that in (370), the locative/oblique
3052Hnominalizer references the location of jùp- ‘sleep’, as might be expected given the
locative marking on the focus-marked interrogative pronoun. By contrast, in (371), the
305Hsubject nominalizer references the actor of jùp- ‘sleep’, despite that this is now not
coreferential with the focused interrogative pronoun. Almost impossible to translate
effectively into a corresponding English sentence pair, the effect of this alternation
appears to be to highlight the relative thematic importance of one or another clause
constituent – quite independently of the effect of focus marking and/or interrogative
433pronoun choice. For example, while (370) might be uttered in the context of a
3054Hconversation about sleeping-places, (371) would be (and in fact was) uttered in in the
305Hcontext of a conversation about a person.

Focused constituents sometimes exhibit non-canonical marking with respect totheir function in the underlying predicative clause, which may at least in part relate to
their basic surface status as appositive clause constituents. For instance, in (372) the
3057Hfocused noun phrase is unmarked for case, despite that it underlyingly refers to a nonsubject argument of nɨ ́k- ‘punch’. This seems to reflect the surface syntactic status of the
focused noun phrase as an appositive clause subject. In absence of case-marking, both
goal and locative construals (associated with locative/oblique nominalizer -kò) are
possible. In (373) however, the focused noun phrase is marked in the accusative, and now,
3058Honly the goal reading is possible. This seems to relate to the usual status of semantic goals
as E (extension to core) arguments in Galo, and the association of accusative case
marking with E argument status (§14.1.3.8).

the most frequent means of asking content questions (§9.5.1.2). Declarative focus
306Hconstructions are relatively rare, being generally used in cases when a speaker wishes to
draw unusually high attention to a contrastive referent, especially one whose identity was
explicitly in question. Accordingly, a declarative focus construction is the normal
rejoinder to an interrogative focus construction (374).

Finally, it may have been noted that in all of the above examples with the
exception of (363)-(364) – that is, all examples involving a nominalized predicate – a
3062H306HTopic marker əə is given in the interlinearization, but is never visible (audible) on the
surface. This perhaps inconvenient fact is due to a convergence of several phonological
factors which need not be reviewed at length here, but which are discussed and
exemplified in §4.2.3. For present purposes, it will suffice to show that in a qualifying
3064Hphonological context, the underlying presence of əə in these constructions can be
adequately demonstrated; in (375), note that underlying əə triggers gemination in the
3065Hunderlying CVCV phonological word /rəko/, following the regular process of Triggered
foot-strengthening (§4.1.4.6).

In this section, types of non-declarative predicative and appositive clauses are
discussed. We first review interrogative clause types (§9.5.1), followed by imperatives,
3067Hhortatives and suggestives (§9.5.2).
3068H9.5.1. Interrogative clauses
Galo interrogatives are divided into polar (a.k.a. “yes/no”) and content (a.k.a.
“WH-”) subtypes.
9.5.1.1. Polar interrogative clauses
The function of a polar interrogative clause is to ask an addressee whether he or
she believes a particular assertion made by the speaker to be in fact the case (‘yes’) or not
(‘no’).
In Galo, polar interrogatives are formed according to one of three basic patterns,
all of which are based closely on (i.e., do not involve significant reorganization of) main
declarative clause syntax.
1) tag particles
2) interrogative particles
3) preferred inflections
9.5.1.1.1. Tag particles
The simplest and most frequent means of forming a polar question is via one of a
variety of tag particles, all of which occur as enclitics to a main declarative clause (in any
person). Most tag particles represent intonational and/or segmental variants of a
“versatile” particle with the core segmental form (ʔə)i, with correspondingly different
pragmatic implications (described in §13.5.1), and may in turn be supplemented in their
3069Huse by phrasal intonation. The tag particle may directly follow the copula/predicate, or it
may follow any other occurring particles, including interrogative particles (§9.5.1.1.2).
307HThe resulting construction has the overall sense of an assertion whose validity the speaker
wishes to check with the addressee. It and all other polar questions may be answered inmm ‘yes’ or máa ‘no’, and/or in a repetition of the questioned clause (or some portion
436thereof, but always including the predicate) in positive or negative polarities. (376)
3071Hillustrates a question-response pair in a predicative clause structure; (377) illustrates use
3072Hof a tag particle in an appositive clause.

father=COP.IPFV=CMPL ATAG
‘(He’s) a father, isn’t he.’ (MK, TT 143)9.5.1.1.2. Interrogative particles
The most explicit means of forming polar questions is via one of several available
illocutionary force particles, all of which occur in the same (predicative or appositive)
clause-final syntactic position, but which vary in terms of semantic value and pragmatic
implications. Among them, ree ‘PQ’ is the functionally “unmarked” polar question marker
(378)-(379). A table of all currently-attested interrogative particles together with further
307H3074Hdiscussion and examples may be found in §13.3.3.

‘Are you (a) Galo?’ (TN, OL6:29)9.5.1.1.3. Preferred inflections
An inflected predicative clause with a second person subject may take on polar
interrogative illocutionary force in certain aspects, usually with a marked falling
intonation. The preferred form for polar questions in a perfect(ive) aspect is Experiential437perfect -bée (§12.3.2.7); the preferred form for polar questions in an imperfect(ive) aspect
3076His Stative -dó(o) (§12.3.2.2).

ín-lɨ ̀ɨ-dó(o)=_̀
2.SG go-DESD-STAT/PQ=FI
‘Do you want to go?’ (*/?’You generally want to go’)
I have the impression that these conventions may be further grammaticalizing,especially in the speech of younger Galo and/or residents of Assamese contact areas. For
many of them, a main declarative clause in Stative -dó(o) is almost always viewed as
having interrogative force, even in first or third person subjects. At the same time, several
of my older consultants and those residing away from Assamese contact areas have
criticized overuse of preferred inflections among some “foothills” Galo, and have
indicated to me that they in turn sometimes find it difficult to determine whether the
speaker intends to form a question or a statement. It remains to be seen exactly how this
development will play out in the speech of future generations.
9.5.1.2. Content interrogative clauses
The function of a content interrogative clause is to question some aspect of a state
of affairs about which some amount of detail is known, usually by replacing the
constituent of a phrase or clause which is under question with an interrogative pronoun.
Galo content interrogatives are formed according to one of three structural patterns:
1) in-situ
2) constituent-internal
3) cleft/focus
Use of one or another pattern is dependent on a variety of factors, including the
type of interrogative pronoun used, the constituent being questioned, the nature of the
predicate/clause type being used to form the question (appositive, predicative and/or
438subtype thereof) and the precise nature of the illocutionary force the speaker hopes to
achieve. The resulting picture is complex, and has not yet been comprehensively
investigated. The following subsections will present the basic patterns involved; a number
of the individual distributional characteristics of interrogative pronouns are also discussed
in §7.3, where their indefinite uses are also reviewed. Some additional remarks on content
3078Hquestion-marking particles are also found in §13.3.3. Ultimately, however, a good deal
3079Hmore research must be conducted before an exhaustive description of Galo content
interrogatives can take shape.
9.5.1.2.1. In-situ
In-situ content interrogatives are formed via replacement of a questioned phrase or
clause constituent with an appropriate interrogative pronoun. In-situ questioning of clause
constituents in Galo predicative clauses is not always possible, since the sense of many
such constructions is indefinite rather than interrogative (cf. §7.3). Where they do occur,
308Hsuch questions often have an informal feel (382)-(384).

In-situ use of interrogative pronouns in appositive clauses is common, and may beunsupported or supported by an appropriate clause-final interrogative particle;
unsupported interrogative clauses again tend to have a less formal feel. Although it cannot
yet confidently be stated as a categorical requirement, the questioned constituent occurs in
(v)cc function with overwhelmingly greater frequency in my data (385)-(387).

Dubitative larèe ‘DUB’ has the same distribution as Polar interrogative ree. It
indicates speaker surprise at seeing an indication that the marked information is or should
be the case, and forms an insistent polar question to verify whether it is or is not so (in
principle, probably expecting a negative answer) (791). In cases where the speaker and
4083Haddressee both know quite well that the marked information is not and can not be the case,
the sense is closer to a rhetorical question, possibly with disapproving and/or mirative
overtones; if (792) were marked in simple Polar interrogative particle ree ‘PQ’, it would
408Hinappropriately suggest the speaker’s earnest ignorance as to whether or not his addressee
(in this case his son) was in fact insane.

infrequently in my corpus, it is commonly believed among my consultants that Dubitativelarèe is namesake of the Lare (larèe) dialect of Galo which forms the focus of this
652description (in Pugo Galo, the corresponding form is lee). I am unable to comment on the
likelihood of this being true or not.
13.3.3.3. Assumptive interrogative rem
Assumptive interrogative rem marks information whose truth/falsity is unknown
to the speaker, but which the speaker believes is known to the addressee. Inasmuch as it
entails a speaker assumption concerning the addressee’s knowledge, it forms a fairly
impatient or insistent-sounding type of question. Although it appears that Assumptive
interrogative rem must derive from Polar interrogative ree plus a following formative m –
which, in turn may reflect either Temporal subordinator әәm, Resolutive m or some (other)
reflex of a PT object-marker *m – Assumptive interrogative rem can mark both polar and
content cleft interrogative clauses (793)-(794).

The principle function of a simplex demonstrative is to mark a referential nonoblique noun phrase for spatial-deictic and discourse-pragmatic values, as discussed in
§7.4.1. In (226), simplex distal demonstrative (upward) tə̀ marks the CS argument of a
269H2697Hcopula clause as spatially upward of the deictic centre. In (227), simplex speaker2698Hproximate demonstrative hì marks the O argument of a final clause as a Proximal topic. 160

her interlocutor, suggesting that use of the speaker-proximate demonstrative was discourse-importanceoriented rather than spatially-oriented. It must of course be admitted, however, that in many cases these uses
overlap (for example, a referent which is near to the speaker may also be important, and vice versa), and it
is not always possible to differentiate in a particular use between these ostensibly different types of function.","[356, 357]"
"653When following a declarative clause or when marking a declarative cleft/focal NP,
Conjectural bәree indicates that the speaker is uncertain of the truth or falsity of an
assertion but believes that the truth is knowable and is presenting the marked information
as his best conjecture (usually, based on deduction from facts rather than evidence) (795).

When following a interrogative clause or cleft/focal NP containing an

is in a position to make a conjecture regarding the unknown information; in (796), the

of the house sitting next to it, and is thus quite confident that at least one will know the

"Topical source constructionAn ablative noun phrase marked in əə is understood as a semantic Source. This
type of marking is roughly equivalent to marking with a Locative ablative demonstrative
(such as tolokə̀ ‘from that place up there’; see §7.4.5), and both markers may occur
435Htogether, “bracketing” the same NP, or apposed in the same function, as in (912). This is a
436Hfrequent yet puzzling construction, and it is not entirely clear whether such forms should
be treated as compositional (particularly in terms of the functions given) or not.
Additional research in this area is required. For further discussion of ablative marking and

14.2.2.2. Prototypically predicate-collocated nominals
As in many Tibeto-Burman languages, as well as elsewhere, it is common in Galo
to find nominals unmarked for case (and typically free of any other modifiers) occurring
immediately adjacent to a predicate and often forming a tight, word-like phonological
and conceptual bond with it. The grammatical status of such forms is not always
straightforwardly determined.
In some cases, it seems clear that the nominal in question is an argument of the
predicate – often, an O argument – which is not case-marked because it is generic and/or
non-referential (§14.2.1.1). In (913), rák- is a transitive verb meaning roughly ‘weave or
438H439Hplait using very large strips’, and can take a variety of O argument types, such as, in this
case, a ‘mithun pen’.

‘(We) can’t make a mithun pen (in this area, because the terrain is too flat).’ (LN,
MH 044)
In other cases, it may be rare or even borderline ungrammatical to utter aparticular predicate type in absence of a particular type of collocated nominal. In (914),
430Hthe S complement clause predicate head kú- denotes a type of fishing traditionally
favoured by Galo women, in which a conical basket trap (raazùu) is placed between the
fisher’s legs, with the mouth facing a large stone. When the stone is lifted, shellfish
hiding under the stone are frightened into the basket, which is then raised and drained.
Only shellfish are caught using this method. In this sense, we can say that tahúm
‘shellfish’ denotes a type of entity prototypically associated with the event or state
denoted by the predicate.

[rɨ ̀-dó(o)]PRED=ree
shellfish
fish.using.basket.trap-IPFV=SBRD do-STAT=PQ
‘Can (that river) be fished for crawdads?’ (RmR, CC 102)
Prototypically predicate-collocated nominals run a fine line between syntacticargument and compound-element-like or incorporated status (Mithun 1984). For example,
predicates in kú- almost always occur with an adjacent, bare noun tahúm ‘shellfish’ as in
(914); although I have found it possible in elicitation to mark the noun tahúm in the
431Haccusative in sentences like (914), thus establishing kú- as – potentially, at least – a
432Htransitive verb root capable of taking tahúm as its O argument head, my consultants
assured me they would never actually speak this way. In natural speech, kú- would almost
never be uttered in absence of collocated tahúm, and tahúm would almost never be case
marked.
In other cases, we find prototypically predicate-collocated nominals occurring
with predicate types which are very clear in being able to take a wide variety of S/A or O
arguments; in this case, however, collocated arguments may occur as a means of limiting
715the denotational range and/or fixing a particular sense of the predicate head. For example,
no visitor to the Galo area will fail to hear the sentence in (915) before long.
43H(915) nó acín dobbé?[nó]A [acín]O
[dó-bée]PRED
2.SG cooked.rice eat-EPF
‘Have you eaten/had your meal yet?’
The occurrence of non-case-marked acín ‘cooked rice’ in (915) limits the
43Hdenotational range of dó- ‘eat’ to one of its potential senses ‘having a meal’, inasmuch as
‘cooked rice’ is the prototypical entity associated with the event type ‘eat a meal’ in Galo
culture. As such, it is possible to correctly answer әәm, dó-bée ‘yes eat-EPF’ ‘yes, I have’
to (915) even if one has on some rare occasion in fact eaten roti bread rather than rice – if
435Hthe roti constituted one’s meal rather than a snack – and one might just as easily ask the
question in (915) as a means of making polite conversation even if one were perfectly
436Haware that one’s addressee did not eat rice for his meal, etc.
Thus, one might suppose that acín-donám ‘cooked.rice-eat.NZR:RLS’ represents a
lexicalized, compound-like association between noun and verb, rather than a clause-level
argument-predicate relation per se, and this is certainly true to an extent. But it is always
possible to case-mark a prototypically-associated nominal if the sense intended is
somehow contrastive. So, for example nó acín=əəm dó-bée? ‘2.SG cooked.rice=ACC eatEPF’ ‘have you eaten the rice ~ have you ever eaten rice’ might be asked if a speaker wasgenuinely wondering if his addressee (presumably a non-Galo) had ever eaten rice before
in his life (assuming there to be any number of other unspecified things which he has
eaten), and/or was aware that the addressee had been served a variety of foodstuffs (as at
a banquet) and was wondering if he had eaten the rice yet (as distinct from whatever else
was known to be available).
Uses of prototypically predicate-collocated nominals abound in Galo discourse.
Although they most commonly reflect an underlying O argument of the predicate, many
other types of relation are also attested. For example, in isì-hú-nam ‘water-wash.bodyNZR:RLS’ ‘to bathe’, isì ‘water’ is an underlying instrument of the verb, as shown in ŋóisì=әə alə̀=əəm hú-rә́ ‘1.SG water=TOP foot/leg=ACC wash.body-IRR’ ‘I’m going to
wash my feet with water (as opposed to a chemical solution, etc.)’. In (916) below, the
437H716sense of láa- ‘take’ is ‘marry’, a transitive sense in which A is ‘(male) marrier’ and O is
‘(female) married (in the sense of having been taken into the family)’. Nominals
prototypically-associated with the ‘marry’ sense of ‘take’ such as ɲimә́ ‘wife’ can be
marked in the accusative if, for example, contrastive with ɲamә́ә ‘daughter-in-law’ (as
when clarifying that one is speaking from the groom’s perspective rather than from the
perspective of an elder male of the groom’s family). In (916), however, note that the O
438Hargument is realized in the syntax as kohùk=əəm ‘dried.oko.leaf=ACC’; and yet, the
prototypical object ɲimә́ ‘wife’ is retained as an un-case-marked, prototypicallyassociated nominal. If ɲimә́ ‘wife’ were case-marked under these conditions, it would
have to be marked in the dative. However, rather than considering ɲimә́ in (916) to occur
439Has a (zero-marked) E or oblique noun phrase, it may be preferable to consider it as weakly
incorporated into and/or compounded to the predicate, in the sense of functioning simply
to restrict or disambiguate the sense of ‘take’ intended (without which, it would be
understood that the A argument referent ‘took’, i.e. picked up, a dried-up oko leaf). The
concept of weak “incorporation” is also discussed in §5.3.2.1.

(NyPB, LAT 008)Noun phrases with underlying dative functions may also occur as prototypically
predicate-collocated nominals; in (917), the predicate-collocated nominal lampó
4351H‘mediator’ could only be marked in the Dative with the sense intended if it occurred as an
independent syntactic phrase. 276
275F276Note also that use of lampó as a predicate-collocated nominal changes the semantic role-assignment ofzáp- from ‘O as addressee’ to ‘O as spoken-on-behalf of’.","[714, 715, 716, 717]"

“words”
The careful reader will have noticed a wide discrepancy between the surface line
of transcription in all examples given above and the parse; namely, morphemes which
look like they form initial elements of “words” in the surface line are given as bound,
right-branching dependent formatives in the parse line. Although this basic discrepancy is
related to the general problem of the disconnect between phonological and grammatical
words in Galo, discussed in detail in §4.1, there are some aspects of this problem which
326Hrelate crucially to the grammatical status of predicate derivations, and which therefore
deserve detailed treatment in this section.
11.1.6.1. Phonological factors
As we noted in §11.1.2, the majority of simple predicate derivations in Galo are
327Hmonosyllabic. Since predicate derivations very often follow a bound, monosyllabic verb
root – and since disyllabic sequences are usually realized as phonological words in Galo
(§4.1.3) – the sequence [VERB ROOT + PREDICATE DERIVATION] is realized as a
328Hphonological word, and is subject to word-level stress- and tone-assignment (§4.1.3.1329H§4.1.3.2), word-boundary phonotactics (§4.1.3.6) and internal assimilation sandhi
320H321H(§4.1.3.7). However, these rules do not, or not in the same way, apply at the boundary of
32Ha predicate derivation in second syllable position and whatever form succeeds it. This is
demonstrated by the application of Regressive voicing assimilation (§4.1.3.7) at the
32Hboundary of the Abilitative suffix with its host verb root in (424), but not at its juncture
324Hwith the ‘CLEAN’ Result suffix in (425).

identified for Galo, rɨkkák and ladù in (425) constitute independent phonological words.
326HAccordingly, the predicate derivation -là(a) ‘ABIL’ is analysed as a phonologically
dependent element of the word rɨglàa in (424), and the phonological head of the word
327Hladù in (425).
328H11.1.6.2. Grammatical factors
The grammatical status of “words” such as rɨkkák and ladù in (425) – and, in turn,
329Hthe grammatical status of their constituent formatives – is a more complex problem. First
consider the grammatical status of the sequence [VERB ROOT-PREDICATE DERIVATION]
([VROOT-PDER] for short) such as rɨkkák in (425):
3240H11.1.6.2.1. Grammatical status of the sequence [VROOT-PDER] 1: “Standalone”
utterance
As was discussed in §5.3.2, verb roots such as rɨ ́k- ‘wash clothes’, being bound,
3241Hhave no “standalone” sense, nor any capacity to be uttered in isolation as “words”. By
contrast, sequences of the form [VROOT-PDER] such as rɨ ́k-kák ‘wash.clothes-CLEAN’ can
often be uttered in isolation, and assigned a context-free semantic value by speakers. For
example, rɨkkák as in (425) has the standalone sense ‘wash (clothes) fully clean’, and
324Hrɨglàa as in (424) has the standalone sense ‘can wash (clothes)’ or ‘be able to wash
324H468(clothes)’. Accordingly, disyllabic forms with the internal structure [VROOT-PDER] often
occur in wordlists, in Galo as in other Tani languages, which may suggest that they have
at least some cognitive reality as “words”. In addition, we can note the occurrence of a
few verb roots whose sense may be incomplete in absence of an appropriate predicate
derivation. For example, consider the transitive verb root cíK- ‘operate door’, which to
some consultants has no real meaning unless an appropriate Result derivation such
as -kók ‘OPEN’ or -túm ‘CLOSED’ is added. So, although cikkók ‘open a door’ and cittúm
‘close a door’ are both perfectly good “words”, some consultants reject ?cinnám ‘to
operate a door’ (< cíK- ‘operate door’ + -nam ‘NZR:RLS’) – possibly because there is little
substance to the idea of operating a door unless one is either opening or closing it.
We can also note a few rare but important cases in which sequences of the form
[VROOT-PDER] seem to have lexicalized. For example, kahí ‘hide’ apparently derives
historically from the PG sequence *ká-ɕí ‘send-REFL’, i.e. ‘send oneself’, however the
erstwhile verb root appears to have obsolesced in modern Lare, and it is no longer
possible to treat kahí ‘hide’ as synchronically compositional as a result. Similarly, takàa
‘ask’ may derive from tà-káa ‘obey-TENT’, literally ‘try to follow/accord with what
someone says’, although lexicalization and attendant semantic shift seem to have
occurred; consultants have only the vaguest sense, if any at all, of the compositionality
and semantic sub-contents of this form. In such cases, it would seem that we are obliged
to grant these (albeit not actively-formed) sequences of [VROOT-PDER] the standalone
status of “words”.
However, we must be cautious about generalizing grammatical “word” status, in
this standalone sense, over the sequence [VROOT-PDER] as a structural type. For, although
we have seen that many such sequences may be uttered and assigned semantic values by
Lare speakers in isolation, not all may. 207 Furthermore, although it is interesting that such
206Fsequences may develop strong interdependency relations to the extent that they may even
lexicalize as units, this fact does nothing to unseat a more robust generalization, which is
that the construction [VROOT-PDER] is highly productive, and is generally open to any two
semantically and functionally compatible qualifying forms. Furthermore, the fact that
collocations of [VROOT-PDER] frequently occur in Tani wordlists translating what are
For example, some of my consultants have disagreed about whether takàa ‘ask’ qualifies as a “word”.
Whether this fact relates to its possible reanalysis as a bound root is an interesting question which I cannot
at present confidently answer.","[466, 467, 468, 469]"

257H7.3. Interrogative and indefinite pronouns
The forms discussed in this section are all available for use as interrogative
pronouns, standing for the questioned constituent of a content interrogative clause.
Content interrogative clause formation is discussed from a general perspective in §9.5.1.2.
2573HMany of the forms discussed below are also available for use as indefinite pronouns in
positive and negative polarities, with senses like ‘something’ and ‘nothing’. The
interrogative or indefinite sense of a pronoun is in most cases determined by the syntax of
the clause in which it appears, together with marking by various clausal particles and,
sometimes, intonation. Very broadly speaking, interrogative force is most often obtained
through interrogative pronominal use in a cleft/focus construction (§9.4), while indefinite
2574Hsense is obtained through in-situ use of a pronoun in construction with an appropriate
particle. However, there is much less regularity to the interrogative/indefinite alternation
found in Galo than exists in many other Asian languages; in what follows, we will to
some extent be required to take a case-by-case approach.
7.3.1. Pronoun of person jə̀(ə) ‘who’7.3.1.1. Structure
Interrogative pronouns of person are based on the form jə̀(ə) ‘who’. Unlike other
interrogative pronoun types, jə̀(ə) shares the basic distribution of personal pronouns in
taking pronominal case suffixes such as Pronominal Genitive -kə̀ (Table 7.7).

personal pronouns, when standing unsuffixed in the strong/stressed (initial) position of a
phonological word, jə̀(ə) exhibits a long or lengthened rhyme, as in (177).

‘(They saw that) no-one was there.’ (TR, FA 012)When suffixed in the genitive and followed by a long vowel-initial enclitic, the resulting
construction behaves as though jə̀(ə) were underlyingly monomoraic. In (178), notice the
257Hmedial gemination under copula enclisis, which is the regular outcome of Triggered footstrengthening (§4.1.4.6; also compare Table 7.3).

‘Whose is that (thing which is in the addressee’s possession)?’ (TZ, 11:21)However, in prosodically unmarked contexts (i.e., when there is no question of the
Bimoraic constraint (§4.1.3.5) not being met, and when gemination conditions do not
2580Hexist), most speakers accept either long or short forms of jə̀(ə) (179).

‘For whom?’ (IlR, EM 26/02/2008)335If one were to speculate, it would seem that jə̀(ə) derives historically from an
underlyingly monomoraic form jə̀, but that regular lengthening exhibited in stressed
contexts such as in (177), and/or irregular lengthening due to emphasis, has become at
258Hleast partially lexicalized. Although most of my consultants are unwilling to make a
straightforward declaration as to the “correctness” of one or the other variant displayed in
(179), it is possible that more detailed study of the use of jə̀(ə) in discourse will be able to
2583Hdiscover a more patterned variation than I or my consultants have found to date.
7.3.1.2. Functionsjə̀(ə) occurs as noun phrase or genitive phrase head only (it has no capacity to
modify another nominal). In-situ use in interrogative clauses is rare but attested, as in the
rhetorical question in (180). More commonly, content questions in jə̀(ə) are expressed as
2584Han interrogative cleft/focus construction (181).

‘Who might be there?’ (TR, FA 010)jə̀(ə) takes on indefinite sense in negative polarity clauses when occurring in-situ
together with Additive particle cìn (177). Indefinite use of jə̀(ə) in positive polarity
2586Hclauses is very rare, seemingly due to the existence of the competing, dedicated indefinite
pronoun of person ɲíi (§7.3.2). Limited use of jə̀(ə) in an indefinite positive sense is found
2587Hin construction with a Suppositional particle báa, as in (182); the sense of the overall
258Hconstruction is, roughly, that the identity of the mentioned referent is possible for the
speaker to know, but that the speaker either does not know it because he is not interested
in knowing it, or perhaps does know it but is not interested in disclosing it (see also
§13.2.2.9).

Indefinite pronoun of person ɲíi is employed in one of two contexts (which indeed
may be two sides of the same conceptual coin). In the first context, the speaker believes it
impossible to know the mentioned referent’s identity (183).

In the second type of context, the mentioned referent is construed (roughlyspeaking) as “any given person”. In (184), the identity of the individual whose stick was
2591Hin fact broken is well-known to both speaker and addressee. However, the speaker is
uttering the statement as a general law, in the sense that any time that any person’s stick
is purposefully broken, an infraction will be determined to have been committed.

“You have to go (with him, as a punishment)...because you broke somebody’s

Indefinite pronoun of person ɲíi quite obviously derives – probably quite recently
– from the lexical noun ɲíi ‘person; human’, and in some uses it can remain perfectly
ambiguous with its erstwhile nominal form (for example, ɲíi=go áa-dùu
‘someone/person=IND come-IPFV’ ‘someone/a person is coming’). However, that ɲíi in
337fact functions as a pronoun in sentences like (183)-(184) is quite certain due to its taking
259H2593Hpronominal suffixal case-marking (§6.1.3) – an impossibility for any lexical noun. In an
2594Hexample such as (184), if ɲíi were to take a phrasal genitive enclitic gə, the sense would
259Hbe of a lexical noun: ɲíi=gə hɨɨdàa ‘person=GEN stick’ ‘(that) person’s stick; the stick of
human(kind)’.
7.3.3. Pronoun of quantity jadɨ ̀ ~ jadə̀ ‘how much/many’
7.3.3.1. Structure
The interrogative/indefinite pronoun of quantity in Galo is jadɨ ̀ ~ jadə̀ ‘how
much/many’. Unlike interrogative/indefinite pronouns of person, jadɨ ̀ ~ jadә̀ takes phrasal
(clitic) rather than pronominal (suffixal) relational markers, suggesting that it has the
syntactic staus of a noun rather than a pronoun per se (Table 7.8).

"Conjunct/disjunct marking12.5.1. Overview
“Conjunct/disjunct” marking is a variety of person-sensitive grammatical marking
which is not generally viewed as reducible to a case of grammatical “agreement” or
“cross-referencing”. Usually, a structure exhibiting conjunct/disjunct patterning has some
other, primary function, such as aspect-marking and/or possibly evidentiality. In a
prototypical conjunct/disjunct system as described for Tibeto-Burman by Hale and
Manandhar (1980) Delancey (1992) and Hargreaves (2005), one type of marking is
reserved for main clause statements with first person subjects and questions with second
person subjects (the “conjunct”), while another type of marking is used in all other cases
(the “disjunct”). In some if not all languages with conjunct/disjunct systems, the conjunct
marking type is also used in cases of main/subordinate clause subject-continuity, while
disjunct marking is used when main/subordinate clause subjects are non-coreferential.
As was briefly noted in §12.3.2.4, there are indications that (subject) person3869Hsensitivity in aspect-marking may have been a more pervasive feature of early Tani
grammar, and may be (probably is) still-operating in the main clause morphosyntax of
some (mainly northern) Tani languages (Sun 2003). In modern Lare Galo, what may have
been a robust earlier system appears to have largely decayed, and is retained in only a few,
relatively marginal, constructions. In §12.5.2, we review the set of constructions in which
3870Hconjunct/disjunct marking is found in Galo, and then return to an overall appraisal in
§12.5.3.
3871H60612.5.2. Patterns
The basic “conjunct” form is Perfective -tó ‘PFV’ (§12.3.2.4). There seem to be
3872Htwo “disjunct” forms, which will be somewhat provisionally described as Perfective -gée
‘PFV.DISJ’ and Imperfective -ée ‘IPFV.DISJ’, although their respective semantic values (in
general as well as with respect to particular constructions) are not yet completely
understood. The patterning of each of the three mentioned forms is somewhat different
according to the construction.
12.5.2.1. ‘Direct’ perfective
In a clause marked by Secondary predicate inflection -bá(a) ‘PFV.DRCT’
(§12.3.3.2), conjunct Perfective -tó is used in statements with a first person subject (692)
387H3874Hand questions with a second person subject (693).

Disjunct perfective -gée ‘PFV.DISJ’ is found in statements with a second or thirdperson subject, and questions with a third person subject (694)-(695). Note that -gée is
3876H387Hsubject to Initial gemination (§4.1.5.1). 239
387H238F239Note also that the system does not appear to provide for a question with a first person subject. This
seems not to be related to conjunct/disjunct patterning as such, but rather relates to difficulties associated
with asking a first person question in the ‘Direct’ perfective -bá(a), which indicates direct experience of an
event; if anyone had directly experienced the speaker’s eating, it would surely be the speaker rather than an
addressee.","[606, 607]"

In sum, the positional incommensurability of Type 1 and Type 2 Phrase-medial
truncation, together with the fact that not all syllables of the same form appear to be
affected, require its identification as an irregular, lexically-specified property of particular
morphemes. Further information may be found in subsections corresponding to affected
morphemes or their derivatives below.
4.1.6. Trisyllabic sequences: word or phrase?
In our discussion of phonological words in §4.1.3, focus fell principally on
disyllabic sequences, which constitute in a sense “prototypical” phonological words.
Despite the fact that most Galo lexemes are also disyllabic, it is of course possible to
encounter trisyllabic sequences; within the noun phrase, disyllabic lexemes are commonly
followed by case enclitics such as əə ‘TOP’ and lo ‘LOC’, and within the predicate complex
trisyllabic sequences such as káa-kèn-dùu ‘look-GOOD/EASY-IPFV’ ‘good-looking;
beautiful’ are commonplace. While there is never doubt that such sequences constitute a174phonological unit of some kind, it is sometimes very difficult to discern whether they are
to be treated as one phonological word, or as two.
Applying the criteria for phonological wordhood summarized in Table 4.1, we
find a certain degree of indeterminacy. Consider the two predicates of (32).
(32)`kaanəmə́…`bɨ ̂ɨ `caalên `dù.káa-nam=əə
bɨ ̀ɨ
càa-lèn-dùu
look-NZR:RLS=TOP 3.SG ascend-OUT-IPFV
‘Having looked…(I saw that) he was leaving for the upper (village).’
In (32), the nominalized, topicalized predicate káa-nam=əə very likely constitutes a
single phonological word. No glottal stop or pause intervenes at the clitic boundary
(between nominalizer and Topic marker), internal rhyme-reduction occurs due to
resyllabification and syncope, and primary stress occurs on the initial syllable only. Now,
however, consider the final predicate. Here again, we have a trisyllabic sequence, but the
syllables seem less well-integrated as a single “word”. Again, no significant pause
interrupts them, but primary stress falls on both càa- and -dùu. Native speakers may writekáa-nam=əə as a single orthographic word, but usually write càa-lèn-dùu as two.
Unfortunately, there is no easy answer here. Some “word” criteria are relatively
robust, and apply to disyllabic sequences only; these include fricative and underspecified
consonant realization, (§3.2.4, §3.4.2) and the prohibition against internal pauses or
glottal stop (§4.1.3.4). However, such criteria are clearly not applicable in every case, as
when fricatives or underspecified consonants are not present in the sequence in question.
Other “word” criteria also apply sporadically to sequences larger than two syllables. For
example, assimilation sandhi (§4.1.3.7) may apply sporadically across word boundaries
(although they are never obligatory in this context, unlike within a word). Word-final
vowel length neutralization (§4.1.4.4) may or may not occur at the boundary of the
second and third syllable of a trisyllabic word, and the question of whether a particular
trisyllabic sequence represents one metrical foot (with one stress position only) or two,
and whether the two stressed slots are equal or unequal are both very difficult questions
on which I have found considerable disagreements among native speakers (see also
§4.2.3).
For now, what may be said with confidence is the following: A phonological word
in Galo is prototypically disyllabic, although monosyllabic, bimoraic phonological words
are also admitted. Phonological units of greater than two syllables generally constitute
phonological phrases, which exhibit some but not all of the properties of phonological
175words – often in a sporadic rather than obligatory form – and which in general constitute
a relatively “looser” phonological structure. Trisyllabic phonological units exhibit
considerable indeterminacy; by some criteria, they may appear to have phonological word
status, while by other criteria they may appear to constitute a phonological phrase
consisting of two phonological words. It is certain that future research, including crossdialectal research within Galo as well as in its neighbours, will shed considerable light on
this matter.
4.1.7. Interim summary
The preceding subsections have suggested that when phonological and
grammatical criteria for word are considered separately, at least four types of outcome are
possible for any polysyllabic sequence of morphemes:
1) phonological and grammatical criteria may converge
2) phonological and grammatical criteria may diverge
In (1), two further possibilities are that we have
a) one word
b) two words
In (2), there are the further possibilities
a) one phonological word comprising two grammatical words or
b) two phonological words comprising a single grammatical word.
Table 4.7 summarizes the possibilities.

4.2.1. Theoretical-typological preliminary
Languages are sometimes described as being “a tone language” or “a stress/accent
language”, as though these characterizations necessarily represented mutually exclusive
types. And indeed, analysis of some languages suggests mutual exclusivity:
In English, a resolute “stress language”, pitch contrasts at the word level (as
opposed to at the phrasal level of intonation contours) are phonetic correlates of stress,
and are not independent of other stress-oriented features such as relative amplitude and
vowel length/extremity. Thus, in minimal pairs on stress in English (such as [`com.bat] vs.
[com.`bat]), the stressed syllable is relatively louder, marginally longer, higher in pitch,
and fully vocalically specified; there are no lexical pairs of this type in English which
contrast in pitch contour but not in amplitude contour, relative duration and so on.
In Standard Thai, an essentially morphosyllabic “tone language”, nearly every
tone-bearing unit (TBU) is also a stressed syllable (in the sense of having a strong relative
amplitude, etc.); if a given syllable is toneless, it is also less prominent in terms of
amplitude, length, vocalic specification and so on (Noss 1964:17-26; Iwasaki and
Ingkaphirom 2005:6). Since the presence of stress features in Thai usually correlates with
the presence of tones (save for “emphatic” stress, which, like English intonation, in Thai
codes a pragmatic function), and since we find minimal pairs on tone but not on stress
(such as màj ‘new’ and mâj ‘NEG’), we view Thai as an essentially “tone” language.
“Pitch-accent” seems less well-defined as a language type; in the classic example
of a “pitch-accent” language, Japanese, lexemes may be distinguished according to the
relative placement of pitch; for example: káki ‘oyster’ and kakí ‘persimmon’ – in these
examples, stress-correlated features such as relative amplitude and duration seem not to
play a role, distinguishing Japanese from a “stress” language such as English. However,
177the status of the system remains basically “accentual”, in that it serves primarily to realize
a particular metrical pattern and is only occasionally employed in lexical contrasts. This
would tend to align Japanese more closely to the prosodic profile of English than to that
of Standard Thai.
In some languages, however, we find both “stress” and “tone” systems operating
to an extent independently, although they may (and usually do) in some ways interact.
Such “hybrid” prosodic systems are considerably less well-described, although some
important advances have been made. 83 Galo is a language with exactly such a hybrid
prosody; in Galo, both tone and stress systems exist which seem to have basically
unrelated diachronic origins and to an extent unrelated domains of primary application,
but which at higher levels appear, to some extent, to interact. In subsections below, we
first discuss tone §4.2.2 and then stress §4.2.3; §4.2.4 concludes with a discussion of their
interaction.
4.2.2. Tone
4.2.2.1. Overview
Galo basically exhibits what has been called a “word tone” system (Mazaudon
1977; Watters 1985; Weidert 1987; Donahue 2003; Michaud and Mazaudon 2006). In
most attested word tone systems, the inherently-specified tones of certain morphemes
(typically roots, but sometimes also affixes) appear to interact, projecting a single overall
tonal “contour” over the entire phonological word of which they are constituents.
In terms of the number of underlyingly contrastive categories, the Galo tone
system is quite simple; only two underlying tonemes must be specified to account for
virtually all tone-based lexical contrasts. 84 Despite the small number of toneme categories,
hundreds of minimal pairs on tone may be adduced at the word level; a small selection is

“Versatile” particles form a small, closed set, and are so-called due to their abilityto occur in an especially wide variety of contexts, both constituent-finally and, in some
cases, constituent-internally. Most have a basically emphatic function, and are used to
draw extra attention to certain clausal and/or phrasal constituents. However, most do not
occur as markers of a cleft/focus construction. Some versatile particles have
homophonous and semantically relatable forms in other form-classes; depending on the
analysis, one could either describe such forms as (probably) diachronically related but
synchronically distinct, or else as constituting a perhaps even more versatile class of
particles than is being envisaged here. Although the first of the two approaches is the one
more consistently taken in this grammar, in the interest of descriptive completeness the
full potential distribution of the versatile particles is presented in subsections below
(Table 13.8).

There is a large set of Galo forms seemingly organized around a basic formative i,
whose functions are probably relatable and may ultimately permit reduction (whether in a
synchronic or a diachronic sense) to a basic form (ə)i ‘Emphatic’. Variations, both
functional and phonological, would then be viewed as products of syntactic position and
scope as well as, potentially, of prosodic expressivity. At the same time, there is certainly
evidence that form-function specialization either has occurred or is in the process of
occurring, and not all possible phonological shapes seem to be permissible in all syntactic
positions/functions. 252 In what follows, three basic form-function categories are described,
251Fwith the caveat that a certain amount of formal and functional “spillover” occurs between
them, and may ultimately reflect the existence of an “underlying” relationship of some
kind.
Emphatic (ə)i ́ occurs as an enclitic to any non-final constituent, seemingly with
local scope. Its basic function is to highlight or draw additional attention to the constituent,
as though to increase a sense of precision or importance. When marking a noun phrase,
Emphatic (ə)i ́ conveys a sense of ‘precisely (this)’, ‘right (then/there)’ or ‘(this) andI have asked numerous consultants on numerous occasions whether one form in i is ‘the same as’ or
‘means the same as’ another, and found the range of possible answers to be almost unlimited, and equally
unlimited in their potential for cross-contradiction!

417HAssam-bordering foothills area, 253 three mentions of Emphatic (ə)i ́ occur.

When marking a predicate, Emphatic (ə)i ́ has the unusual property of occurring
within the predicate complex, either following the predicate word and preceding any
particles, or else (and more often) interrupting the grammatical predicate word (see §10.6
418Hfor discussion of this phenomenon in a more general context). In either case, the position
of (ə)i ́ is always clitic to the left edge of a phonological word – it cannot occur within a
phonological word (811)-(812).

however, I have not been able to properly verify. Some of my consultants consider Emphatic particle use or
overuse to be bad form or to constitute low-register speech, although its use is certainly addictive; I have
been personally scolded on several occasions for my unseemly imitation of these patterns!","[660, 661, 662]"

More often than not, Assertive da follows Evidential ben, with which it may be inthe process of fusing as a unit. While a clause in simple Evidential ben has a “noncommittal” feel, as though the speaker were simply presenting information for which
there is evidence, but whose veracity he may well doubt himself, further marking in da
establishes the speaker’s commitment to belief in its truth, as though the evidence seen
were viewed by him as irrefutable (despite his having had no direct access to experience
of the depicted event). As such, simple ben might be used in a case when the speaker is
himself pondering a question, and may invite a rejoinder from someone with better access
to information, while benda might be used in a case when the speaker considers himself
to be in a relatively better position to present the case. In (772), the speaker has seen the
4035Hperson in question with wet hair, supposes that this can only indicate that she has bathed,
and, knowing well that his addressee has not seen the evidence (since he has just arrived
and asked for the person’s whereabouts), believes himself to be in a good position to
make a confident assertion.

Exhortative dê is found widely throughout Arunachali languages, as well as in
much of Upper Assam (and elsewhere in India), and there is uncertainty over its origin
and direction of borrowing; 247 whatever the facts may be, it is clearly a salient, useful and
246Freadily loaned form. In Galo (as also in the Mising and Boro dialects spoken nearby to the
Galo area), the function of dê ‘EXHR’ is basically one of prodding or exhorting anSome of my consultants believe de to be a reduction of Galo ədè, a supposed interjection which I have

the speaker. dê ‘EXHR’ also frequently combines with Emphatic tag (ə)ì to form a
relatively insistent type of polar question, with a strong implication that the speaker
believes the addressee will or should respond positively (773)-(774).

"66reflected single-word elicitations and as such lacked the insight into underlying
representations which can only be obtained in Galo inductively, through comprehension
of the workings of Galo morphophonology. For example, underlying word-final vowel
length is not transcribed by Weidert; this is because word-final vowel length is only
discernible under enclisis, which is in turn only available at the phrase level; in isolation,
word-final vowel length in Galo is phonetically neutralized (§4.1.4.4). Similarly, Weidert
mistakenly assigned the three phonetic tones which he transcribed an equal tonemic status,
apparently lacking an understanding of the sandhi-like behaviour emerging from the
interaction of underlying morpheme tones in different word types, syllable shapes and
contexts (§4.1.3.2). Also, certain (but not all) underlyingly voiceless finals were
transcribed as voiced in Weidert’s data; these forms correctly reflect the outcome of
regressive voice assimilation rules under suffixation and enclisis, but as underlying forms
are incorrect. Furthermore, due probably to his limited exposure to Galo dialects, Weidert
incorrectly found free variation among [s] and [h] initials; these are in fact separate
reflexes of Proto-Galo *ɕ- which are in complementary distribution among native
lexemes in every Galo dialect I have yet encountered, albeit in different ways. Although
Weidert couldn’t have known this fact, he might perhaps have been more careful in the
manner of his elicitation. The fact is that most Galo are able to control more than one
dialect, and when freely alternating forms are provided by consultants, it is usually
reflective not of free variation within a single dialect, but rather of cross-dialectal
variation of which they happen to be aware; this was the case for Weidert’s “/s ~ h/”
initial (§3.2.4). Finally, and this moves somewhat beyond the Galo data, Weidert perhaps
overambitiously chose morphologically non-corresponding terms to compare among his
Galo and Apatani data, leading him to arrive at an absurdly large number of nine tone
categories; such a figure could hardly be thought to reflect actual historical splits in the
Tani languages, which are, all things considered, relatively conservative and slow-moving
in terms of their historical phonology (a fact which should have been clear to Weidert,
since he knew the segmental phonology of most of the Tibeto-Burman languages
unusually well). When Post (2005) compared a more tightly constrained list of fully
corresponding Apatani and Galo terms, a much more realistic-seeming set of two tone
categories emerged, with very few exceptions; it is certain that Weidert would have easily
discovered these if he had taken a more disciplined approach, since his core data were
more than adequate to the task. These weaknesses notwithstanding, Weidert’s work is
among the five or six most reliable studies ever produced on Tani languages, and served
67an important practical purpose as a complement to the core sources used by Sun in his
groundbreaking (1993b) work.
Tian-Shin Jackson Sun, for reasons of inaccessibility, was unable to obtain
reliable data of sufficient scale for any dialect of Galo, and so could not include Galo data
among the core materials for his (1993b) magnum opus A Historical and Comparative
Study of the Tani (Mirish) Branch of Tibeto-Burman. Nevertheless, he stands
unchallenged as the founding father of Tani linguistic studies, and thereby deserves a
special mention here. His work has served not only to form the foundation of Tani
historical and comparative studies – on which I will build but only slightly here – it did so
with uncompromising scholarly excellence, producing results which have held up to
every possible scrutiny (except – and only except – when the data available to him, and to
every other linguist in the world at that time, were inadequate to the task). It is my
privilege to follow in the footsteps of such a masterful scholar, and my truly great fortune
as a grammar-writer to be able to stand on such solidly-prepared historical-comparative
ground.
Very rarely, a few mentions of Galo have popped up in works treating broader
subjects. The Ethnologue (Gordon 2005) contains a brief typological profile based on
unnamed sources, about 50% of which fails to match my data and seems to me to be in
serious error. 23 LaPolla (1994) includes Galo among the languages surveyed in his wellknown paper on parallel grammaticalization in Tibeto-Burman. In that paper, it is in my
view dubiously reported that “Kombong Galo” has Anti-Ergative marking (in LaPolla’s
sense; see §14.3.1), although since the data source is not cited it cannot be verified.
Locally, a small handful of Galo have begun efforts to represent the phonology,
lexicon and grammar of their language, with varying levels of success. The Itanagarbased Galo scholar Toni Koyu has led an admirable attempt to develop a wholly
indigenous script “Tani Lipi”, which is based primarily on Galo phonology but is claimed
to represent the phonologies of all Tani languages. His efforts are supported by many
Galo, but due largely to practical difficulties associated with learning and implementation,
his script has not achieved broad usage as of this writing. Duri Taipodia, a poet and singer
23The description is short and concise enough to enable us to address its most serious errors: 1) “genitives
after noun heads”: if “genitive” means “genitive phrase”, genitives are overwhelmingly pre-head in my data
(§6.1.2.2.3) 2) “relatives after noun heads or without”: if “relative” means “relative clause”, pre-head
relatives are statistically more common in my data, and post-head relatives may in fact be better analysed as
internally-headed (§15.3.1.3) 3) “question word initial”: if “question word” indicates a “question marker”,
these are obligatorily clause-final in my data; if “question word” indicates an “interrogative pronoun”, these
typically occur in-situ, and/or in a focus construction (potentially preceded by other syntactic constituents)
(§9.5.1) 4) “maximum prefixes 2”: there is at most one (usually non-productive) prefix on any Galo word in
my data (§5.3.1.1) 5) “nontonal” is wildly wrong as an overall description of Galo, as has been clear since
the well-known work of Weidert (1987) (§4.1.3.2).","[66, 67, 68]"

via an interrogative cleft/focus construction, discussed in the broader context of

Non-declarative clauses other than interrogatives more closely resemble main
declarative clauses in terms of basic syntax and marking. Specific indications of
illocutionary force are encoded in most cases either via different modality inflections
(§12.4.2), via clause-final particles (§13.3.1), or via a combination of the two. Intonation

speech act markers are homophonous with and probably derived historically from
aspectual suffixes. Most imperatives and hortatives are obligatorily second person in Galo,
although some suggestives can only occur in first person; these are discussed in several
subsections in §12.4.2. Third person hortatives can only occur if licensed via a special
3094Hparticle pəna (with a third person subject; see §13.3.1.3), or else by Causative

‘Boini, what are you up to?!’ (KN, OLB4:88)In addition to standing as a core argument noun phrase head as in (196) and (197),
269H2630Hinterrogative jòo also has the ability to stand in a variety of non-core noun phrase
functions, which will not be fully exemplified here in the interest of space (see Table 7.9).
2631H342In addition to standing as a noun phrase head, jòo has the ability to stand as a questioning
modifier of a distinct noun phrase head. In this case, the sense is ‘what/which (type of) N’,
in the sense of questioning the nature of a referent whose overall type is already known
(198). Note that this is a different function from that of Partitive ‘which (member of a
263Hset)’; this sense also occurs as a syntactic modifier, marked in the Partitive sense of
Ablative postposition lokə̀ (see §14.3.6.2).

‘Whatever happens, it’s all the same.’ (IkR, HC 009)7.3.4.3. Extended functionsjòo ‘what’ has taken on a set of extended functions which, while clearly relatable
to its basic function as an interrogative/indefinite pronoun, are not easily describable in
terms of the same set of syntactic features or constructions.
In a use which may derive originally from an emphatic use of its indefinite sense
in a negative polarity clause such as in (202), jòo is also now available as an interjection2639Hlike expression of emphasized impossibility (203). Possibly, the evolution of this function
2640Hwas assisted both by the ability of jòo to occur as a pre-head modifier, as in (202) (cf.
2641H(198)), as well as by its (prosodically regular, but often emphasized for increased salience)
264Hfrequent occurrence with a rising-pitch tone contour – which lends itself naturally to
emphatic extensions.

A second functional extension of jòo, quite different from the preceding, is that ofa universal pro-form with the basic semantic value ‘etcetera; and all that sort of thing; and
so forth and so on’. This sense seems to emerge out of the potential indefinite value of jòo
in a positive polarity clause, but also seems to depend on being able to occur as the
second member of an appositive construction as in (204).

Use of jòo in appositive constructions such as (204) with unmarked/nonreferential

namely, to the qualifying noun jòo ‘and/or suchlike’, also discussed in §8.3. Although

particle laa ‘CQ’. According to my consultants, the understood sense is something like
‘what (is the problem here)’, ‘what (are you prevaricating over)’ or ‘what (ill do you think

prosodic feel of a clause-internal constituent, quite clearly falling within the same overall

Full reduplication of jòo ‘what’ results in a semi-compositional form joojòo,
whose basic sense when standing as a noun phrase head in an interrogative clause is ‘what
sort (of thing)’; often, the implication is distributive, as though the entity under question
were plural, diffuse, or potentially various in nature (cf. also the general discussion of
reduplication in §5.5); however, the distributive reading is not necessary (210).

nominalization)Genitive marking of subjects in a non-subject nominalization can create potential
ambiguities which are not generally found in other nominalized clause types. This is
because the syntactic position of the genitive-marked subject of a nominalized clause –
generally, at or close to the leftward periphery of the nominalized clause – is very close to
the syntactic position of a Genitive phrase constituent of the higher noun phrase. 294 This

A similar problem attends nominalization of extended transitive clauses. Although
the unmarked order of extended transitive clauses in Galo is A E O V (§9.2.2.4), this
4568Horder cannot operate effectively inside a non-subject nominalization. This is because the294This is not a problem in the case of subject nominalizations, because the subject is either ellipsed or an
unmarked “internal” head, nor in the case of event nominalizations, seemingly because events are not as
easily construed as possessed. The ambiguity may exist in locative/oblique nominalizations, although it has
not been robustly-attested due again to the difficulty of construing many locative/oblique semantic types as
possessed. The prominence of this potential ambiguity among non-subject nominalizations can perhaps then
be explained by the ready ability for non-subject nominalizations to denote concrete, possessible entitities.","[766, 767]"

4657H16.3.1.2. Disjunctive/alternative coordination
Closed disjunctive coordination among Galo interrogative clauses (‘x or y?’) may
be obtained through apposition of structurally parallel clauses with contrasting semantic
values (§16.2.1). This construction may be additionally supported through marking in
4658Hmáa. In the main a Negative polarity particle, and basically homophonous with the
Negative polarity predicate suffix -máa (§12.2) and the Negative interjection máa ~ máʔ
4659H‘no’ (§13.7.3), in disjunctive function máa marks a polar (closed) alternation between
460Htwo coordinated interrogative clauses. The marked clauses may themselves contrast in
polarity, or they may not. When two clauses are coordinated as in (1060), disjunctive máa
461Htends to pattern prosodically with the supporting clause, although it is important to note789that this is not a synchronically available position for a negator morpheme; in absence of
the focal clause of (1060), the utterance would be ungrammatical. 301

‘Will (life in the future) be better or (…) will it be worse?’ (MN, FYG 010)A prosodic alternative to the construction in (1060) locates the Disjunction
463Hparticle closer to the focal clause, typically after a pause. The function in this case is to
indicate a speaker’s acknowledgement that his addressee might be finding his earlier
utterance somewhat dubious, and is thus offering an alternative that might be more
acceptable to his addressee (1061).

Disjunctive coordination of declarative clauses is not well-coded by Galo
grammar, and generally requires a paraphrastic construction involving a linking clause
with a sense like ‘if that is not the case, then’ (not shown).

Concessive coordination (‘although/despite (that) x, (still/nonetheless) y’) between
two final clauses is marked in daram, a particle for which no plausible complete

understood that an unspecified alternative were implied, but omitted for some reason (perhaps with an
appropriately lilting intonation); it would not be possible to interpret rəkên jaarə̀ dɨɨmá in (1060) as a final

"Summary and directions for further research
Throughout the above sections, I have maintained the principle that predicatederivations are not themselves capable of heading any syntactic term (cf. §11.1.6.2).
3672HHowever, it must be acknowledged that the occurrence of predicate derivations or
(usually disyllabic) clusters of predicate derivations as phonologically independent
“words” potentially leaves them open to reanalysis as grammatically independent terms.
And, there are a few indications that certain predicate derivations which occur frequently
as predicate-internal phonological word heads have been reanalysed as auxiliary-like
grammatical word heads, albeit in strictly limited conditions). For example, in §11.2.6.2,
367Hthe capacity of -là(a) ‘ABILITY’ for limited occurrence as a “light” predicate head in
responses to polar questions was discussed.
Such cases are, perhaps surprisingly, very rare; however, it is easy to imagine such
a structure spreading in Galo, or being more widespread in another Tani language; since a
productive construction of this type would have profound implications for the analysis of
Galo predicate grammar, additional signs of this or any similar type of construction
should be carefully watched-for. As discussed in a more general context in §2.3, it seems
3674Hvery likely that what I have described in this chapter as types of bound, grammaticalword-internal formatives originated diachronically as types of more or less syntactically
independent terms (probably, as types of serial verb). In this sense, the history of the Galo
predicate grammar can be viewed as one of increasing grammatical amalgamation. It
would be very interesting indeed if signs of its later de-composition could also be
discovered.
Finally, I should point out that although this forms the largest chapter by far in the
present work, I have only really scratched the surface by outlining what I see as the
general properties of predicate derivations and listing just a few of the particular
properties of some of the more functionally important predicate derivations identified to
date. A complete analysis will require several years of in-depth research and a far larger
overall presentation, given the sheer number of forms involved. I certainly have hopes
that this larger study will be able to be conducted.",[566]
"812. Historical development – From Proto-Tani to modern Galo dialects
The present chapter provides an introductory overview of a partially-reconstructed
history of the Galo language. It focuses primarily on morphological and phonological
developments from the Proto-Tani stage, to the Proto-Galo stage, to the present Galo
dialects. It mostly ignores both pre-Proto-Tani stages within Tibeto-Burman (for which
very little evidence exists in any case) and extra-Galo developments both within Tani and
elsewhere (for example, areal phonology is almost completely disregarded). Comparative
syntax is similarly marginalized, inasmuch as the quality of existing comparative Tani
language description permits little more than conjecture on this account. Thus, although is
hoped that the below description will serve to illuminate some aspects of modern Galo
grammar and phonology which might otherwise appear arbitrary or idiosyncratic –
namely, by suggesting some plausible hypotheses as to how they might have come about
in terms of a very general overall background of historical change – it must be
emphasized that we are not yet in a position to provide an exhaustive account of pre-Galo
phonology and grammar, and a certain amount of speculation under such conditions is
inevitable; nothing in what follows is presented as fact. 24
In what follows, §2.1-§2.3 discuss topics in historical (pre-)Galo morphological
typology, while §2.4 turns to phonology. The reader may wish to refer at several points to
Appendices B and C, which contain presentations of the set of regular PT (Proto-Tani),
PG (Proto-Galo) and Lare and Pugo Galo segmental correspondences and change tables
respectively, as well as to Appendix A, in which a list of modern Lare roots is given
together with their PTs reconstructions (where available).
2.1. Morphological profile of Proto-Tani
Proto-Tani shows signs of having been, or having had a near ancestor which was,
a basically “morphosyllabic” 25 language of the type found commonly in Mainland South-24Note also that no serious claims are advanced here concerning time-depth, either of Proto-Tani or of any
stage since then. I am not aware of the existence of any uniformly reliable method for determining linguistic
time-depth in absence of written records, which in this case are unavailable.
25
The useful term “morphosyllabic” was coined by Timothy Light (1978) in the context of tonogenesis
theory, and was also used by Sun (1993b) with specific reference to Proto-Tani. Broadly speaking, a
prototypical morphosyllabic language is strongly isolating and analytical, with a basic unity
syllable=morpheme=word predominating. Very little well-grammaticalized material is found, with most
grammatical functions coded by lexemes in particular constructions (such as serial verb constructions).
Typically, morphosyllabic languages also exhibit relatively simple segmental phonology as well as lexical
tones. Not all scholars have adopted this useful label; however the basic characteristics of the typology in
question are generally agreed-upon.","[81, 82]"

4915HThe argument status of “direct” contents of speech and thought is somewhat
difficult to determine. Certainly, post-predicate occurrence as in (1173)-(1174) is highly
4916H4917Hunusual for predicate arguments, and yet this is the statistically most common position for
direct content reports. And, while at least some types of direct content reports appear to
occur clause-internally, such forms are not generally replaceable by pronouns in the same
syntactic functions. Finally, however, note in (1177) that the speaker changes speech
4918Hverbs between the first and second clauses despite the lexical semantics of the speech
event remaining quite clearly unchanged. This turns out to be necessary precisely because
of the change in complement type: while ə́m- ‘say; tell’ is subcategorized for an unmarked
clausal speech report complement (in addition to a common nominal S), mèn- ‘speak’ (in
its transitive sense of speaking to an addressee) is subcategorized for a common nominal

"Basic predicate structure
A prototypical main/final clause predicate is headed by an obligatory predicatestem, optionally expanded by predicate derivations, and obligatorily terminated by a
predicate inflection. The basic structure is schematized in Table 10.1/Figure 10.1, and

The obligatoriness of the head is almost exceptionless. Very rarely, predicatehead-ellipsis is observed in rejoinders to polar questions involving derived predicate
stems, but this possibility seems to be licensed by only a tiny handful of predicate
derivations – possibly, only two. 202 The obligatoriness of inflections is similarly almost
201Fexceptionless, although there are a few examples in my data in which derived predicate
stems stand uninflected as head of a final predicative clause. Although such cases do not

(disyllabic) vowel sequences or as (monosyllabic) long vowels, basically two types of
evaluation criteria are available. The first concerns native speaker intuition, as to whether
a particular ViVj sequence “sounds” more like some given, unproblematically
monosyllabic word or more like a disyllabic word. The second concerns
morphophonological processes; does the language “treat” a ViVj sequence the same way it
treats monosyllables with long vowel nuclei, or does it treat it like a disyllable.
Evidence collected to date has been mixed. When asked to compare the forms in
Table 3.7 with unambiguous monosyllables such as ɲíi ‘person’ and máa ‘no’, and
unambiguous disyllables such as abó ‘father’ and tabə́ ‘snake’, most of my consultants
felt that distant (polar) pairs such as in aú ‘fat/grease’ were closer to monosyllables, while
closer pairs such as in ɲɨə̀ ‘year after next’ were more like disyllables. 62 However, there
was considerable disagreement among my consultants in many cases.
In terms of morphophonology, evidence comes from the (seemingly stressmotivated) morphophonological rule of Triggered foot-strengthening. In this case,
evidence seems to point to a bimoraic (monosyllabic) analysis: aú=əəIt is perhaps also worth noting that potentially diphthongal forms such as aú always have a clear (nonbreathy/aspirated) release (see §3.3). While not a decisive criterion in itself, this fact would tend to support
a view of such forms as long vowels/single syllable nuclei rather than as short vowel/disyllabic sequences;
if [u] in aú had the phonological status of a short vowel/syllable nucleus, it should seemingly exhibit a
breathy/aspirated release.
62140‘fat/grease=COP.IPFV’ is resyllabified [au.wə]. See §4.1.4.6 for additional discussion and
examples.
In short, the existence of diphthongs in modern Lare Galo can at present be neither
confirmed nor denied. Given the relatively small number of candidate forms (relative, that
is, to unambiguously monosyllabic or disyllabic forms), it is possible that this represents a
“less stable” area of the phonology, or a less robust pattern over which language learners
are able to generalize rules. Along the same lines, it is possible that the
morphophonological rule discussed here – while certainly productive in modern Galo –
nonetheless has its origins in a “pre-diphthongal” phonology, in which forms such as aú
‘fat/grease’ more closely resembled disyllables in their realization than do the modern
forms. This is of course only speculation; ultimately, it would seem that the possible
emergence of diphthongs in Tani languages would represent a fruitful area for crosslinguistic phonological research.
3.4. Marginal phonemes
3.4.1. Glottal stop
The phonemic or non-phonemic status of glottal stop in South-East Asian
languages (as well as elsewhere) is a topic which is perhaps as often disagreed-upon as it
is discussed. The problem surrounds the facts that, while a glottal stop onset to otherwise
vowel-initial syllables (and, in some languages, also a coda) is often more salient, more
often realized, and potentially, more phonologically relevant than it is in many other
languages, glottal stop nonetheless frequently exhibits some deficiencies in its distribution
which would argue against assigning it the same status as other consonants. For example,
in her Thai-English Student’s Dictionary Mary Haas (1964) finds a phonemic glottal stop
in word-initial and final positions, but Robert Noss, writing around the same time, was
able to assign glottal stop to a “stress” phoneme, in light of the fact that unstressed terms
in Thai tend to lack a glottal stop (Noss 1964:9). Alec Coupe, analysing the Mongsen
dialect of Ao (Naga), acknowledges that while syllable-final glottal stop must be specified
in the underlying representation of many terms, its deletion before suffixes (as well as
non-occurrence in syllable-initial position) shows that it cannot not have phonemic status
on a par with other consonants (Coupe 2007). Similarly, Genetti (2007:50) argues that141although glottal stop has relevance to the phonological patterning of certain other
phonemes (notably o), evidence is insufficient to assign it independent phonemic status.
Glottal stops rarely have the salience, obligatoriness, and cognitive reality to
native speakers of South-East Asian languages that other consonants have. At the same
time, they are often persistent, and correct use can in part mark one as a good or poor
non-native speaker. The question of whether or not to assign phonemic status is not only
an academic question of adding another element to the inventory, however. As Coupe
(2007:53) also points out, the presence or absence of glottal stop can provide crucial
evidence for phonological word boundaries.
In Galo, glottal stop is almost completely absent in word-final position, generally
occurring only as a marker of emphatic speaker attitude (as in the disagreement
interjection máʔ ‘no (your presupposition is incorrect)’ (§13.7.3). Word-internally, glottal
stop is never found. In word-initial position, however, glottal stop figures prominently.
Vowel-initial words are usually realized with a glottal stop onset in clear speech, blocking
onset-loan from the final consonant of a preceding term (as apə̀k-arə̀k ‘perfect-RDUP’
‘intelligent’, syllabified as [ʔa.pək.ʔa.rək], not *[a.pə.ka.rək]). In running speech,
furthermore, vowel-initial words are usually realized with a glottal stop onset, leading to a
staccato-like patterning which is often striking to a non-native speaker (16). 63(16)porók-luggóm ʔuudəlá...ʔaɨɨgə́ ʔalə́kə dollòmporók-lugó=əəm úu-dó(o)-là(a)=_́́

‘After waking up at the cock’s crow...they pound the paddy with their own

Thus it would seem that presence or absence of glottal stop can provide supporting
evidence for locating word boundaries in Galo (§4.1.3.3), as in Ao Mongsen (Coupe
2007).
However, the fact remains that the tendency for speakers to realize glottal stops
before vowel-initial morphemes is nowhere near as strong as the tendency to realize any
of the other consonants discussed above. Omission of glottal stop in e.g. kaí-nà (ʔ)ikìi
63My impression, both as results from the texts used for this study and from general observation, is that this
is more true for the speech of women than in that of men, although why that should be escapes me.","[140, 141, 142]"

Some variations to the basic themes may be found, generally with marked or nonprototypical senses. For example, dóo- ‘lie down’ may sometimes be used to predicate the
existence of an animate entity which is not in fact in a lying-down position or
permanently-settled situation. The effect in this case is to suppress the animacy and/or
thematic importance of the referent in question. For example, in (84), which is a sentence

marginal relevance to the main event-line of the narrative.","[256, 257]"

"163results from pòo- ‘liquor’ + á- ‘keep’, not *powà. 79 Glide-insertion is also found in the
morphophonological process of Triggered foot-strengthening. In this case, a vowel-initial
enclitic motivates geminate glide-formation at the boundary of a ViVj word, with the glide
quality a function of the Vj vowel. Thus time, back rounded vowels are affected, ashoə́=əə → [how.wə]; for further discussion and examples, see §4.1.4.6.
So far, we have covered cases in which an initial form ending in a long vowel is
followed by a dependent vowel-initial form. Word-internally, an initial form ending in a
short vowel, if followed by a vowel-initial form, behaves in the same manner; the result is
a disyllabic [V.V] sequence. However, when a host phonological word ends in a
permitted short vowel (i, ə, o and, rarely, u), a following, dependent vowel-intial form is
resyllabified as a prosodic constituent of the host. This process is also discussed in
§4.1.4.6.
The Very long vowel constraint is relatively easily dealt with in synchronic
analysis, since its effects can always be “undone” by removing the conditions of the
alternation (e.g., a particle may be inserted between hoə́ and əə in the above example). In
diachronic analysis however, it can prove troublesome. This is because when a given
vowel-final root only has exemplars in a vowel-adjacent context, it becomes difficult or
impossible to determine its underlying (or historical) length. The case of poà ‘rice beer
storage basket’, discussed above, is easily dealt with inasmuch as numerous other
attestations of both roots exist (such as in opòo ‘liquor’ and anám ‘to keep’. In the case ofaì ‘heavy’ however (in which the initial reflects a short prefix a-), is the rhyme, reflecting
the ‘heavy’ root and the only attested lexeme in which this root appears, underlyingly
long ìi- or short ì-? This is a potentially vexing question which is not always easily
resolved. For discussion of one possible solution (albeit with limited applicability), see
§5.3.2.2.

additional functionality in construction with -mín ‘APPLICATIVE: JOIN’ (§11.2.5.10) and,

-tóm ‘APPLICATIVE: SHOW’ may be described as a manner applicative. To date, it
has only been attested on verbs in mèn- ‘say’ and káa- ‘look’ – intransitive and transitive
verbs respectively – adding a sense that the predicated event amounts to an act of
‘showing’ someone something (as when teaching someone a skill). Syntactically, it adds
an E argument – which may be marked in the Accusative/Non-agentive (like O) or else as
Dative – whose referent is understood as the ‘showee’. Although one or more core
arguments are ellipsed in all naturally-attested examples, (524) and (525) are elicited
3508H3509Hexamples in which all core arguments are present, and which illustrate Non-agentive and
Dative marking of the added E argument respectively. Note that the E argument is not
licensed in absence of the applicative suffix in either example, irrespective of marking
type.

351Hit may bear an earlier derivational relationship with káp- ‘cry; weep’ (§2.4.2.5).
3516H11.2.5.6. Locational/Relational applicatives
The forms discussed in this section all function either to add an obligatory
argument to the predicate, or cause an already-subcategorized argument to be understood
differently. Semantically, they involve locational and/or relational meaning; their effects
are usually best translated by adpositional phrases or serial verb constructions in other
languages. The discussion of Locational/Relational applicatives in effect began in §11.2.2,
3517Hin which they were mentioned in the context of Motion/Direction derivations. Although it
is clear that there are certain Motion/Direction derivations which are not applicative, and
certain Locational/Relational applicatives which are not (or not obviously) relatable to
motion, it is at present unclear where a boundary between these two categories may be
said to exist; this question remains for future research.
-káa ‘APPLICATIVE: AT/ON’ is most frequently attested as a transitivizing
derivation to intransitive verbs of activity such as ár- ‘glance’, cóm- ‘peek’, míK- ‘blow’,ùm- ‘grunt’, kók- ‘crow’, zə́ə- ‘shout’, góp- ‘measure by handspans’ and ɲɨ ́r- ‘laugh’
(532). Its effect is to add an non-subject argument understood as an entity ‘at’, ‘on’ or
3518H‘against’ whom the activity denoted by the predicate is directed. (532) is ungrammatical

from certain.
-tén ‘APPLICATIVE:ATOP’ is attested as a transitivizing derivation to intransitive
activity and transfer verbs such as zə́ə- ‘shout’ and dùu- ‘sit’; it introduces a non-subject
argument whose referent is understood as affected ‘under’ the predicate semantics;
another way of understanding this is that A is understood as performing an event
532‘over(head of)’ or ‘atop’ O, as dùu-tén ‘sit on something’, or as in (533); note that zə́ə3520H‘shout; blabber’ is lexically intransitive.

‘Yell over to Last Brother’s Wife (to call her)!’ (MN, OLB7:15)-tén is also attested on transitive verbs; in this case, -tén functions simply to expand the
range of semantic types available to O, and/or to cause O to be understood more generally
as a Location or Goal rather than a Patient or Experiencer (534).

(ZR, OLC1:150)It is likely that -tén derives from the transitive verb tén- ‘suspend; hang from above’.
The form -góo appears to have two senses, ‘APPLICATIVE:AROUND’ and
‘APPLICATIVE:BEFORE’, although the first sense is considerably more frequent in my
corpus. My consultants have in general been able to effectively disambiguate these senses
in interpretation, and they may have distinct lexical origins in the transitive verbs góo‘enclose’ and góo- ‘lead (animal)’ respectively, although this is entirely speculative.
However, a clear motivation for treating góo- as a single, polysemous form is even less
obvious; for the present, I shall analyse two independent, homophonous forms.
-góo ‘APPLICATIVE:AROUND’ functions to add an E argument to an intransitive or
transitive caseframe – usually, one involving motion – whose referent is understood to
have the predicated event/state directed ‘around’ it (535).

When the E argument is ellipsed, -góo can have a vague directional sense
‘around’, as in English ‘walk around’; this is more or less the sense of the first clause in
(535). However, it is always possible to make the location overt, as in the second clause
352Hof (535), indicating that the applicative function is indeed basic to the overall sense.
3524H-góo ‘APPLICATIVE:BEFORE’ functions similarly to introduce a non-subject
argument to a typically motion-oriented intransitive or transitive caseframe which is
understood as ‘preceded’ or ‘gone before’; however it is much less frequently-attested.

‘I went up before y’all did.’ (IR, 19:89)-gə̀ə ‘APPLICATIVE:ONTO’ has two probably relatable senses roughly translatable
as ‘touch’ and ‘attach’; both senses introduce an non-subject argument to an intransitive
verb whose referent is understood as ‘touched’, ‘attached-to’ or more generally moved
‘onto’. In attested cases, the same sense was applied to the inherent O of a transitive verb.
The ‘touch’ sense is more commonly found with transfer or motion verbs (537),
352Hwhile the ‘attached-to’ sense is more commonly found on stative verbs and adjectives
(although it is also attested with motion verbs). Interestingly, in the case of stative verbs
and adjectives, the sense is effectively causative, with the attributant of the property or the
state undergoer surfacing as O (538).

As definitively shown for the first time by the eminent Taiwanese scholar TianShin Jackson Sun (1993b), Galo falls within the Tani subgroup of Tibeto-Burman.
However, both the position of Tani within Tibeto-Burman and the position of Galo within
Tani remain to be fully worked-out. While I cannot address the first question in the
present work, I will attempt to address the second.
As noted earlier, this is the first comprehensive grammar not only of Galo, but of
any of the Tani languages; accordingly, we lack adequate grammatical descriptions such
as would enable us to subgroup languages and dialects on the basis of the shared
morphological innovations which have been noted e.g. by Dixon (1997) to be the most
effective criteria for subgrouping when available. However, on the basis of segmental
phonological correspondences, and by comparison with the Proto-Tani (PT)
reconstructions by Sun , we can establish a Proto-Galo (PG) segment inventory which
places it in the position in Sun’s (1993b) tree shown in Figure 1.7. We can very
provisionally further group those Galo dialects I have studied to date as in Figure 1.8.

‘The male slave I gave (to someone)’ but not *‘The male slave to whom I gave

be underlyingly subcategorized for E arguments. For example, Goal arguments of motion
verbs and Theme arguments of throw verbs are both referenced by non-subject
nominalizer -nam – as ín-nam mookò ‘go-NZR:NSUB place’ ‘place which was gone to’ andnáa-nam ɨlɨ ̀ɨ ‘throw.at-NZR:NSUB stone’ ‘stone which was thrown at

arguments of motion verbs are usually either unmarked for case, or are marked in the
locative (although accusative marking is possible in a limited, “experiential” sense; see
§14.3.2.3), while Theme arguments of transfer verbs are generally marked as topical
420Hinstruments (§14.2.2.1.2.1).
421HIn sum, E arguments align with O arguments in some respects (accessibility to
Accusative case-marking and Non-subject nominalization) but not in others (consistent
Accusative case-marking and accessibility to internally-headed relativization).
At the same time, E arguments are distinct from obliques, despite that their
syntactic marking may sometimes overlap. Consider the oblique temporal and mediative
noun phrases, which initiate and terminate the sentence in (869).

syntax, rather than within the clause syntactic core as E arguments tend to (see for694example (866)). Also, neither the temporal nor the viative noun phrase may be
42Hcoreferential with a non-subject nominalization in -nam.
Thus, the picture that emerges is one in which O and E arguments are consistently
opposed both to subject functions (S and A) and to oblique functions, but are neither
consistent in their alignment nor in their opposition to one another. This scenario is

reporting verb ә́m- ‘say (that)’ obligatorily subcategorizes for a direct speech report in271The “usual suspect” approaches would be to treat the O relation as “direct object” and the E relation as
“indirect object”, or else as “primary” and “secondary” objects respectively. I do not see how either
approach would be appropriate here. First, “primary” and “secondary” object as defined by Dryer (1986)
refers to the grammatical alignment of extended transitive Recipient and transitive Patient in opposition to
extended transitive Theme – that is clearly not in evidence here. Regarding “direct” and “indirect” objects –
which refers to the consistently different grammatical treatments of O and E, O standing as “direct” object
and E as “indirect” object (and in which E may be “promoted” in some constructions to the “direct” object
relation) – I hope I have shown that this too is not obviously in evidence (although I do not doubt that a
good case in favour of this analysis could be made).","[693, 694, 695]"
"Theoretical preliminary to nominalization in Galo
As is by now well-known, it is common in Sino-Tibetan languages to findextensive grammatical exploitation of structures which are synchronically analysable as
nominalizations, derive historically from nominalizations, or else derive from a third,
diachronically prior structure which also developed separately into a nominalization
(Matisoff 1972; Genetti 1992; Noonan 1997; Bickel 1999; DeLancey 2002; Yap and
Matthews in press).
The most commonly-identified type of structure is what I will here call a
nominalized clause. A nominalized clause is here defined as a marked derivation of a
predicate and/or clause, such that the resulting structure is able to stand as head of an
argument noun phrase within a second, higher clause. Usually in Sino-Tibetan languages,
nominalized clauses may also stand as clausal adnominal modifiers, i.e. relative clauses
and nominal complements. Often, we also find what are here described as clausal
nominalizations (a.k.a. “standalone” nominalizations). Clausal nominalizations generally
resemble main clauses – they are not subordinated to any higher syntactic constituent –
and yet they exhibit nominalizing morphology (or morphology which also has
nominalizing functions), or otherwise in some way resemble a nominalization. Finally,
and seemingly more rarely, non-clausal adnominal modifiers such as genitive phrases are
often viewed as participating in the same overall syncretism, usually because they are
marked by morphology which also performs nominalizations and/or relativizations
(Matisoff 1972; Noonan 1997). As far as I can see, all of these structural types potentially
fall within the descriptive scope of Bickel’s (1999) term “Standard Sino-Tibetan
Nominalization (SSTN)”, which has gained wide if not universal acceptance. In Galo, we
find extensive exploitation of all of these grammatical structures, with the exception that
Genitive marking and/or non-clausal nominal subordination do not generally seem to
relate synchronically to Galo nominalization processes. The Galo genitive marker gə/-kə̀
is not relatable to any attested Tani nominalizers, does not itself mark predicates which
are not independently nominalized.
An exhaustive review of the theoretical questions which arise in the course of
determining the synchronic grammatical status of nominalization-derived structures falls
outside the scope of this work (more detailed discussion will be found in Post (in752preparation-b)). However, for the purpose of grounding the presentation to follow, a few
key points should be established.
The first is that I take in this work a conservative and literal view of the concept of
“nominalization”. In this view, the term “nominalization” strictly denotes all and only
those members of a set of grammatical operations in which a term which may be treated
as a nominal by the grammar of a language is derived from a term which cannot be so
treated. Although there may be some semantic or even pragmatic values that also adhere
to a given type of nominalization (such as “reification” or “backgrounding”), these values
are neither necessary nor sufficient criteria to the designation of any particular structure as
a nominalization.
The second point has to do with synchronic versus diachronic dimensions of
analysis. As many previous works have already noted, the fact that a given structure
resembles a nominalization morphologically does not necessarily indicate that it has the
synchronic grammatical status of a nominal (see e.g. Genetti (1992)). That is, although a
particular structure may employ morphology which is elsewhere employed in the function
of nominalization, if it cannot be directly employed in a prototypical nominal function
(particularly, as head of an argument noun phrase), it is not a clear candidate for analysis
as a synchronic nominal, whatever its internal form and historical origin. In addition,
when a nominalizer resembles a form with some other type of functionality – say, a nounsubordinator – this does not necessarily indicate either that they represent a single
synchronic form-class (polyfunctional or not) or that any one function has evolved
directly from any other. It is equally possible that some earlier form gave rise separately
both to nominalizing functionality and to some other type of functionality. Certainly,
structural and functional resemblances will exist in such cases, but resemblances do not
count as evidence either of an active synchronic relationship or of a direct historical
relationship (i.e., of the form *A → B).
In sum, I count a structure as a synchronic nominalization if and only if it licenses
treatment of a non-nominal as a nominal by the grammar. This is not to say that the task
of identification is necessarily easy or straightforward, but it is set as an overall goal. As
to the diachronic dimension, it is not assumed that any one type of structure necessarily or
even naturally evolves from or is diachronically relatable to any other type of structure;
rather, the question of precedence (i.e. of a nominalizing or some other type of
structure/function) is left open to demonstration via comparative analysis and
morphosyntactic reconstruction.","[752, 753]"
"2301HN-V compounding and/or “lexical incorporation”It is very common to find predicate-adjacent nominals unmarked for case in Galo.
The syntactic status of such forms is sometimes difficult to determine – are they noun
phrases, or are they predicate-dependent nominals, and if the latter, does it constitute an
instance of compounding or lexical incorporation (in the sense of Mithun (1984))? This
question is addressed from a general syntactic perspective in §14.2.2.2. In this section, it
230His simply noted that to the extent that certain frequently-occurring unmarked N-V
collocations become conventionalized – sometimes, with a sense greater than the sum of
both parts – it is possible to view them as lexicalized constructions (whether with the
morphosyntactic status of compounds, or as some looser syntactic formation).
A list of some commonly-attested N-V collocations with possible lexical
compound status is given in Table 5.44.

root is no longer used with this sense in modern Lare Galo – it retains only the specialized meaning ‘plow’.
The sense of ‘go’ may sometimes be found in Galo proverbs and other set expressions, such as §14.2.2.3 ex.

in -mèn are not in most cases analyzable as lexicalized compounds, but instead reflect
active formations.
Some predicate derivations are more selective than -mèn ‘PLAYFUL MANNER’. For
example, -báa ‘QUICK MANNER’ (§11.2.1) only occurs on verbs which are graded or
30Hiterative, and cannot occur on punctual verbs. A few predicate derivations are so
semantically particular that they may only occur on a tiny subset of verbs; -jóo
482‘INSULTING MANNER’ has only been accepted by my consultants on verbs of locution.
Finally, there are a few predicate derivations whose behaviour can only be described as
stubbornly idiosyncratic. For example, -gò ‘WARM/HOT RESULT’ (also discussed in
§11.1.7.1), is rejected on nearly every possible stem with the exception of verbs of
301Hmanipulation. It is the only Result derivation which has been rejected in combination with
the verb root mò- ‘make’ (the standard means of determining the core semantic value of a
Result derivation in Galo). The reason for this lone rejection can only be wondered at.
In sum, there is evidence of highly semantically-particular and/or idiosyncratic
selectional behaviour among predicate derivations, which would tend to point toward
their analysis as compounded lexical roots. However, the greater trend is in favour of
productivity and predictability of behaviour within a specified range.
11.1.7.3. Class-openness
A final criterion we might consider is class-openness. That is, we might expect that
whereas a grammatical class of suffixes might be closed or highly resistant to expansion,
a lexical class of roots might be more open to expansion. Again here, the data are mixed.
We can immediately discount the possibility of unrestricted use of Galo roots as
predicate derivations; for example, as discussed already in §11.1.7.1, although the
302Hpredicate derivation -zèk ‘INTO CHUNKS’ has an apparent classifier root cognate in zèk‘CLF:SLICES’, it is also apparently the only one; it is not possible in Galo to use simply any
classifier root as a predicate derivation.
The most promising candidate source category for expansion of the class of
predicate derivations would appear to be verb roots. It is here that we find the largest
number of forms which are apparently cognate to predicate derivations, they are
morphologically adjacent, and even exhibit a certain functional consistency, as shown in
(441). So can verb roots be freely imported for use as predicate derivations?
30HIn brief, no. Consider again the case of Galo ‘wash’ verbs kák- ‘wash a surface’,rɨ ́k- ‘wash clothes’ and hú- ‘wash a body’. Recall from §11.1.7.1 that kák- ‘wash a
304Hsurface’ has a likely cognate in the predicate derivation -kák ‘CLEAN RESULT’, which
occurs in terms such as rɨkkák ‘wash clothes clean’ hukák ‘wash a body clean’ andkakkák ‘wash a surface clean’. However it is not possible to say *rɨgrɨ ́k, *kagrɨ ́k, *hurɨ ́k,
483*rɨksú, *kaksú or *husú; i.e., it is not possible to enlist the verb roots rɨ ́k- ‘wash clothes’
and hú- ‘wash a body’ for use as predicate derivations.
At the same time, predicate derivations are sometimes discovered in situations in
which it seems extremely difficult to discount the possibility that they are being directly,
and actively, derived from verb roots. For example, when I asked one of my consultants
to explain to me the meaning of the verb root cə̀p- ‘pinch’, I was shown a piece of paper
being stuffed between the wall and its crossbeam, an activity which my consultant then
described as hɨ ̀ɨ-cə̀p-nam ‘press-PINCHED-NZR:RLS’ ‘to press something (between two
surfaces), pinching it’. This would seem to be a clear indication that my consultant saw
the forms cə̀p- ‘pinch’ (the form I had asked for) and -cə̀p ‘PINCHED RESULT’ (the form
which he actually returned) as, in effect, semantically interchangeable (although,
potentially, pragmatically different). Furthermore, it seems to me here that the order of
derivation would be most straightforwardly analysed as verb root → predicate derivation
rather than the reverse; could this not be describable as an active synchronic derivational
process?
It seems to me that it could. However, observations such as these raise an
interesting theoretical and methodological question: how is it possible for the analyst of
Galo grammar to distinguish, phenomenologically, between 1) observing a case of
expansion of the class of predicate derivations and 2) discovery of a predicate derivation
which had been previously unattested? Unless the boundaries of the class of predicate
derivations were initially well-defined, it is not easy to see what “expansion” would
necessarily mean. 212
21F11.1.7.4. Interim conclusion
Returning to the question posed at the outset of this section, are Galo predicate
derivations roots, suffixes, or (in some sense) both? Evidence reviewed to date suggest
that in some sense, they are both. That is to say, certain predicate derivations – such
as -cə̀p ‘PINCHED RESULT’ – so closely resemble a probably cognate verb root that it
One promising test might involve loanwords or nonce forms. That is, one might stipulate a form *lòo-,
with the nonce semantic value * ‘of a pitcher, to break’ and test its ability to pattern as a novel Result
derivation, e.g. My efforts in this area to date have failed, with consultants invariably returning the Result
derivations (or other types of predicate derivation) which they would actually use in this function. Whether
a more imaginative experimenter than myself might design a better test than I have and return more
promising results, I shall leave to be seen. As for loans, I have found no indications to date that they may
ever be used as predicate derivations.
212484would appear that the predicate derivation should by similarly analysed as a type of root –
potentially, as the same root in two different functions. At the same time, other predicate
derivations – such as -hí ‘REFL’ – apparently reconstruct to Proto-Tani as predicate
derivations in the same function (in this case PTs *ɕu ‘Reflexive’), are highly abstract and
do not seem to relate to a lexical root; such forms seem quite straightforwardly
describable as suffixes. These two types seem to represent two fairly comfortable
analytical extremes. However, there are also numerous examples of virtually every
imaginable type in between; a paradigm example would be -kák ‘CLEAN RESULT’ (cf.
§11.1.7.3).
305HTo avoid drawing an arbitraty division, I will continue to refer to Galo predicate
derivations as bound dependent predicate formatives, without adopting a final position as
to their categorically more root-like or suffix-like status, both individually and as a class.
It is conceivable that an effective categorical division – such as “combining root” versus
“derivational suffix” – or subcategorical division – such as “lexical” versus “functional”
predicate derivations – will eventually be able to be made; however, I am unable to find
clear evidence for such divisions at present.

“If we actually use this river, this Hika-Hija River to escape...where (down there)

If the marked referent is neither potentially visible nor on the path of a nearby
river (practically speaking, when it is separated from the deictic centre by at least one
mountain range) the same set of terms encodes the compass points north, south and
east/west. Selection in this case is, however, not straightforward. Initially, the speaker
must assess the position of the deictic centre – say, the place of speaking – relative to his
home or home village. If the speaker is at his home village, the referent is marked
according to its compass position relative to the place of speaking. For example, (224)
268Hwas spoken by a resident of dɨpə́ village who was staying in dɨpə́ village at the time of
speaking. dɨpə́ village is located in the Assam-bordering foothills at an elevation of about
100 metres, and is considerably lower in elevation than Itanagar, the capital of Arunachal
Pradesh, at about 440 metres. However, Itanagar, at 27.1° N, is further south than dɨpə́,
lying at approximately 27.7° N; hence, the speaker uses a notionally “downward” locative
demonstrative.

‘How am I to go (south) to Itanagar (having neither car nor money)?’(IR,
OLT16:34)If the speaker is not at his home village, then it becomes a question of whether the marked
referent is located in his/her/its home village or not. If it is, then selection is relative to the
place of speaking. If it is not, then selection is relative to the speaker’s home village. For
example, a resident of aalóo (Along) town would, if speaking from Itanagar, refer to dɨpə́
(or an entity construed as located within dɨpə́’s limits) using Downward/Southward
demonstratives; this is because aalóo – the speaker’s home– is located at 28.17 ° N, and
this – not the location where the speaker happens to be – is construed as his deictic centre.
355Finally, in case the relative location of the referent-to-be-marked is unknown to
the speaker, or is presumed by the speaker to be unknown to the addressee (for example,
if the referent is or is located in a place or country whose name is known, but whose
location relative to the deictic centre is unknown), same level demonstratives are used as a
sort of “default”. For example, the following sentence is almost always uttered when I am

importance.

consistently represented, and I have hopes that this will become possible in a future
expansion of this work.
4.2.4. Integration of surface prosody
Integration of surface prosody remains one of the greatest standing challenges in
Galo language description. The view sketched above is one in which the basic prosodic
constituent is the phonological word, and where prosodic rules apply at both word and
phrase levels. The question is whether all prosodic phenomena are sensitive to and/or
identify precisely the same types of constituent. We have already seen some evidence that
this may not be the case; for example, the shape of a tonal contour may or may not be
sensitive to the same basic word-and-syllable-level structural features to which rhythm
appears to be sensitive. Furthermore, we have seen evidence from tonal contours that
certain grammatical non-head elements (such as a predicate-adjacent nominal, including a
subject pronoun) behave as though they formed an element of a phonological phrase with
a following head. However, it is not at all clear what their metrical status with respect to
the overall phrase would be.
Ultimately, it would seem as though in the process of shifting from a basically
morphosyllabic language (cf. §2.1) to a basically synthetic, agglutinating language,
prosody has played a central, and possibly a motivating role. Furthermore, it may be that
the process remains ongoing. Just as stress and rhythm may have motivated historical
sound changes at the word level (for example, Word-final weakening; see §2.4.4.5), the
same basic patterns may now be motivating shifts in constituency at a higher level (for
example, the collapse of the Topic-marker əə into some types of lexeme, as exemplified
in §4.1.4.6).
Finally, a topic on which this grammar is almost completely silent is that of
pragmatically-oriented sentence/phrasal intonation (for a brief overview of linking
intonation, see §16.2.2). Although it is clear that pragmatically-oriented intonation exists
in Galo, and interacts with the mainly lexically- and rhythmically-driven prosody
described in this chapter, the process of discovering regularities to this interaction has but
barely begun. Under the circumstances, and given the complexities involved, it is certain
that Galo prosodic phonology will remain an intriguing and rewarding topic for
continuing research from a variety of perspectives; I sincerely hope that this very basic
description will provide some suggestive avenues for further inquiry.
2024.3. Phonetics and phonology of Topic marker/Imperfective copula əə
The phonetics and phonology of Topic marker and Imperfective copula əə are far
from straightforward; although all of the processes governing their audibility and effects
on neighbouring segments/syllables appear to be regular, and are discussed in sections
such as §4.1.4.5 and §4.1.4.6 above, they can be difficult to keep track of. Since both
forms are important to much of the grammatical argumentation that appears in this work,
it will be useful to have a general reference; this is provided in Table 4.13. Table 4.13
also serves to demonstrate the phonetics and phonology of the Accusative enclitic əəm,
which seems to bear a cognate formative əə. To derive the outcome of enclisis in
Accusative əəm, the reader should simply replace each of the final vowels in the sixth
column headed “Surface” with an [m] (for example, abó=əəm ‘father=ACC’ → [ab.bom]).

(AO, CC 102)The abovementioned syntactic possibilities notwithstanding, it is certainly the case that
speakers view sentences like (1143) as being “about” the subordinated proposition –
4857Hrather than “about” any particular nominal referent as such. This would seem to make it
clear that, at a minimum, we are dealing in a semantic sense with a complementation
strategy, if not with syntactic complementation per se.
16.5.4.4.1. Quasi-modal of necessity
A seeming semantic extension of the ‘be passable’ sense of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ gives the
closest fully native Galo equivalent to the Assamese loaned/calqued modal of necessity inlagí-/lage (§16.6.2.1). As an “Indic-avoidance strategy”, it has high emblematic value as a
485Hconstruction, but certainly suffers from relatively much lower frequency of usage than the
Assamese loan/calque, particularly in the foothills (1144).

‘I had to push him (to do it).’ (MN, OL23:125)Sentences such as (1144) are understood as having a strong ‘necessity’ overtone, but
4860Hpossibly have, or are at least potentially ambiguous with, a weaker core sense alike to ‘it
did to x/was considered reasonable/passable to x’. Note also that negation of the matrix
predicate does not indicate lack of necessity, but rather indicates that the subordinated
proposition simply ‘won’t do’ (1145); although necessity to not do something can be
4861H832expressed through negation of the subordinated clause predicate (not shown), it is not
possible to directly negate the semantic ‘necessity’ operator in this construction (i.e., to
state that it is not necessary to do something). This fact suggests that while useful as an
alternative in some cases, this construction has not in fact grammaticalized a true modal
usage, and probably does not represent a true (or realistic) native alternative to the
Assamese-derived modal in lagí-/lage.

In a certainly recent and frequently-exploited case of desubordination, a
subjunctive-like construction has developed through deletion of matrix verb rɨ ̀- ‘do’ in the
sense ‘do (British sense); be passable’. Clearly capitalizing on the hypothetical semantics
of other types of clausal subordination, a “stand-alone” clausal subordination in this
condition has the basic sense ‘that [CLAUSE] should be the case’.
In a few cases, the matrix verb can be replaced with little change in meaning, as in
(1146); a sentence originally uttered with no matrix verb. When asked, the speaker
4862Hresponded that he was “saying it short” by leaving the matrix verb off and felt it was
“more correct” to include it; note also the seeming transference of the ‘be necessary’
sense of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ discussed in §16.5.4.4.1.

In other cases, the “subordinate” clause seems clearly to be exhibiting mainclause-like status. In (1147), note the occurrence of clause-final hortative particle káa
486H‘HORT.ADVS’, which ordinarily occurs as a predicate enclitic. A consultant later informed
me that although it would be possible to include an imperative matrix verb in rɨ ̀- ‘do’
(preceding the hortative particle), the sentence was probably “better” as attested.
833Accordingly, in such cases it would seem preferable to view the “subordinated” clause inbə́ as, in fact, a main clause in subjunctive mood.

It is not clear to me why exactly Galo should lack both human and genericclassifiers, although at least part of the explanation may be found in the existence of an
individuating article go (292). As was demonstrated by Post (2007), individuation in the
2870Hcontext of tracking discourse-referents is the most frequent use of a generic classifier by
far in at least some South-East Asian languages, and may represent the primary
motivation for generic classifier grammaticalization. The fact that Galo already has an
independent means of individuating referents seems to remove this motivating factor.
However, while this may explain why Galo has no well-grammaticalized generic
classifier, it does not explain why Galo lacks one at all. 183 Future comparative research in

Mensural classifiers may be used as lexical nouns denoting an entity which is used
to collect or group other entities (293), or an abstractly-conceived unit of measurement of
2871Han individual, set of individuals, or substance (294). Or, they may be used as postposed
287Hquantifiers of a nominal head (295)-(296).

this might be a formally useful way to “round off” the system, in absence of any structural or distributional
evidence or implications it would seem to amount to an empty claim.","[394, 395]"

Modal predicate derivations express some aspect of the speaker’s attitude toward
the information contained in the predicate or its arguments, including ideas of (relative)
certainty, need, possibility, ability, capacity, obligation, necessity, or desirability/desire.
None have cognate forms elsewhere in the language, so far as I can see. Forms attested to
date are listed in Table 11.9.

-dée ‘PROSPECTIVE’ marks an event or state as having a real possibility of coming
to pass, in the sense of not being subject to any external constraints (579). In negative
360Hpolarity clauses, the sense is opposite, i.e. of restriction, prohibition, or some other
external constraint (580).

‘You’re prohibited from eating chillies; you’re prohibited from eating squirrels
(during the taboo period).’ (MN, T16:34)
In terms of frequency, -dée most often occurs in nominalizations, where its senseis often closer to future/irrealis; i.e., that the marked event/state will or is expected to
come to pass (581). This may amount to a functional compensation for the relatively
3608Hgreater set of restrictions placed on occurrence of the Irrealis suffix -rә́ in nominalized
clauses (cf. §15.3.2.2.2).

‘Who will be tonight’s cook (i.e., my wife or yours)?’ (MN, OL23:86)-dée is also subject to a very unusual ordering constraint which suggests it may be
in the process of a category shift, either to inflectional suffixal or some sort of modal
auxiliary-like status. When occurring in a quadrisyllabic predicate structure, -dée has
been observed to preferentially follow the negator, a property usually reserved for
predicate inflections; compare (581) with (582).

3612Hthis may be indicative of a category shift.

Ability -là(a) ‘ABIL’ refers to the subject’s ability to bring about the predicated
event/state, in terms of skill, knowledge, technical facility, or some more general means
(584); -là(a) ‘ABIL’ most often cross-translates English ‘can’.

‘Now, we can’t even go up to the Adi place anymore (because we’re old and

3614Hoccurring as the third syllable in a quadrisyllabic (or larger) predicate, its rhyme is
obligatorily truncated, as [la] (585).

‘Will you be able to quit (smoking)?’ (MN, OLB4:7)552Finally, -là(a) ‘ABIL’ is one of the very few predicate derivations capable of
occurring with an ellipsed predicate head, albeit in strictly limited conditions. (586) is a
361Hpossible rejoinder to questions such as (585).

sentence like (586) can only be contextually derived from a sentence like (585); i.e., -là(a)
3619H3620H‘ABIL’ cannot be straightforwardly used as predicate head in a simple declarative clause.
This topic is discussed in a more general context in §11.1.6.2.
3621H11.2.6.3. Capability -làk
Cabaility -làk ‘CAP’ is indicative of the subject referent’s capacity or capability to
bring about the predicated event/state, in terms of the subject referent’s inherent physical
characteristics, some other natural characteristics, or more generally as a result of some
necessary or unalterable conditions that obtain in a particular situation, as in (587).

‘She couldn’t return to her parents’ house either; the stone had completely
submerged her.’ (LN, TG 072)
Although -là(a) ‘ABIL’ could also occur in the bolded position in (587), the speaker would
362Hthen be heard as implying a relatively greater potential on the part of the subject referent
to control the predicated event. Thus, for example, while ŋó ín-là(a)-máa ‘1.SG walk/goABIL-NEG’ ‘I cannot go’ might be used in a case when a prior social commitment prevents553one from going somewhere, ŋó ín-làk-máa ‘1.SG walk/go-CAP-NEG’ ‘I’m unable to go’
would imply that one’s legs are broken, one’s leg muscles are undeveloped (as a newborn
baby), or that one suffered from some other unalterable incapacitating condition.
11.2.6.4. Desiderative -lɨ ̀ɨ
Desiderative -lɨ ̀ɨ ‘DESD’ most directly translates the desiderative modals found in a
wide range of other languages, such as English want. It generally indicates of the clause
subject referent a desire, wish or choice-based intent to bring about the predicated
event/state (588)-(589).

‘She’ll do as she pleases, I suppose (despite whatever I may tell her).’ (MN,

In negative polarity clauses, -lɨ ̀ɨ ‘DESD’ has a particularly strong connotation whichis often best translated as English hate rather than don’t want/like, as káa-lɨ ̀ɨ-máa ‘lookDESD-NEG’ ‘hate; despise (the sight of; lit., ‘don’t want to see’)’ or dó-lɨ ̀ɨ-máa ‘eat-DESDNEG’ ‘can’t stand (a food)’.","[550, 551, 552, 553, 554]"

Structural Very long vowel constraint§4.1.3.8Table 4.1 – Summary of criteria for the identification of phonological words in Galo4.1.3.1. Word prosody 1: Stress and meter
While the overlap is perhaps not complete, there is a very strong tendency in Galo
for a phonological word to consist of a single metrical foot, and for a metrical foot to
constitute a single phonological word (cf. §4.2.3.2). This generalization tends to hold
quite independently of the grammatical status of the elements in question. Thus in (21),
seven phonological words are realized, each consisting of a single metrical foot with the
initial syllable always stressed (marked `_). However, nammə́ and zaalâa are not
themselves grammatical words, but are rather portions of grammatical words, as
expressed in the interlinearization.","[156, 157]"
