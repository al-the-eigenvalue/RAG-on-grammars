"13.2.1 Clause-final interrogative particles
13.2.1.1 Polar (yes/no) interrogative ma
The polar interrogative clause-final particle is (atonal) ma. It is arguably
identical to the disjunctive particle ma ‘or’ (§7.2.1). If this equation is correct, it
raises the interesting question whether one sense (interrogative or disjunctive) is
basic. In German, oder ‘if’ is often added to a statement as a kind of polar tag
question marker: Du hast schon gegessen, oder? ‘you have already eaten, or?’.
If the disjunctive sense is taken as basic in Jamsay, then we have a possible
structural parallel to the German construction, functioning however as the basic
polar-question construction. Since the final ‘or’ (in this interpretation) is the
truncation of a fuller version of the (polarized) second clause (‘you have already
eaten, or [sc. you have not yet eaten]?’), this would account for the typical
nonterminal intonation of the Jamsay particle (see below). On the other hand, a
disjunction of the type ‘X or Y’ could be taken as a kind of question in many
contexts: compare ‘X or Y will come’ with ‘(I wonder whether) X will come,
(or) Y will come’. Moreover, many polar questions involve disjunctions: ‘Will
X or Y come?’.
However, a complete identification of the polar-question and disjunctive
particles is doubtful. It will be seen below that ma is also optionally used after
WH-interrogatives, which are not interpretable as disjunctions.
The Jamsay particle appears with variable pitch and duration. In my
interpretation, it is subject first to Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137),
which extends the preceding phonological tone into the particle, resulting in ma@
or ma$. Of these, ma$ is more common (at least at the end of full clauses), since
positive inflected verbs all end in L-tones. After this rule applies, the particle is
then frequently (but not obligatorily) subject to intonational modification, in
the form either of prolongation (), pitch-raising (), or both ().
Whether intonationally raised or not, the pitch is often steady-state during
the articulation of the particle. However, I have occasionally observed a slowly
falling pitch that I indicate with symbols , similar to the dying-quail
intonation (symbol ).
In polar interrogatives, the corresponding reverse-polarity statement, or
some other proposition contradicting the first, may also be added. In this case,
ma occurs minimally once, at the junction between the two propositions. The
prosodic grouping is variable, with ma often clearly grouped with the preceding462Focalization and interrogationproposition, but sometimes in a prosodically seamless string combining both
propositions.

"4.7.1.1‘One’, ‘same (one)’, and ‘other’The numeral ‘1’ is tu@ru@. This form is used in counting, and as a postnominal
modifier to denote a single unit (in an unmarked context, as in answering a
‘how many?’ question): u@ro@ tu@ru@ ‘one house’. Unlike other numerals, which do
not take -n and -m suffixes, tu@ru@ often takes (human) Sg suffix -n when
modifying a human noun: dç$ƒç&-n tu@ru@-n ‘one Dogon’. tu@ru@ is also used in the
iterated distributive tu@t-tu@ru@ (syncopated from /tu@ru@-tu@ru@/) ‘one by one, one at
a time’ (§4.7.1.6, below).
In the form tu@ru@, this numeral behaves like other numerals in requiring that
a preceding modified noun show its lexical tones. However, for paired body
parts (‘hand’, ‘foot’, ‘eye’, etc.), there is an alternative construction with
HL-toned tu@ru$ and all-L tone for the noun, as for nouns preceding ordinary
adjectives: E$nE@ ma$ nu$mo$ tu@ru$ ‘one of his hands (nu$mo@).
tu@ru@ is not generally also used in the fashion of French un(e) and English
a(n) or some as an indefinite article, e.g. to introduce a new discourse referent.
Likewise, informants rejected plural #tu@ru@-m ‘ones’, with or without a
preceding plural noun.
Another form, perhaps historically related to tu@ru@ in some way, is the
adjective tu@mno@, which can be glossed (in context) with preceding noun X as
‘(a) single X’, ‘(only) one X’, or ‘the same X’. Here the pragmatic nuance is
more emphatic, denying the possibility that a second X is relevant, or that the
original X has been replaced by another X.
The adjective ‘other’ is la$ƒa@. It can be used either in the sense of
‘additional’ (as in ‘I already own one house, and want to buy another’), or in the
sense ‘alternative’ (as in ‘I don’t like my current house, I’m going to sell it and
buy another one’). As a pragmatic sentence-adverb with no modified noun, la$ƒa@
is common in the sense ‘furthermore’ or ‘in addition’.
When a pair of entities or other nonsingular set has already been introduced
as a discourse referent, contrastive sequences of the type ‘one went, the other
(one) stayed here’ can be expressed by repeating the numeral ‘one’ in a
parallelistic construction (236).

elicited examples. The modified noun preceding the numeral has its regular

added, the R-tone is generally audible even in modifying function (238.c).

"118Phonology(133)Tone Dissimilation
In decimal numerals beginning with pE@ru@- ‘ten’, this morpheme drops
its tones when the following single-digit numeral begins with an H-tone3.7.3.5Atonal-Morpheme Tone-SpreadingThere are a number of suffixes, with no intrinsic tone, that can be added to
nouns, adjectives, or verbs. The relevant phonological shapes are -Ø (zero), -C
(-n or -m, i.e. always a nasal), and syllabic -vC or -Cv.
The nasals are phonologically straightforward for nouns and verbs, since
the relevant stems are vowel-final and the final vowels carry tones. These tones
are simply spread over the resulting bi- or trimoraic final syllable in a natural
way. If the tone is simple H or L, this pure tone just spreads to the nasal. If it is
a contour tone, the final tone component is realized on the nasal; see ContourTone Stretching (143), below.
There are two morphological combinations, however, where an atonal
syllabic suffix is added to a tone-specified stem (134).
(134)a. Sg -in or Pl -um after C-final adjective
b. 3Pl -ba or 2Pl -be in inflected verbIn both cases, there are some issues involving stems with final contour tone;
these will be taken care of in connection with Final-Tone Resyllabification
(148). For present purposes it suffices to point out that the final tone of the stem
is spread into the previously atonal suffixal syllable. This is seen most clearly
when the final syllable of the unsuffixed stem is monotonal H or L. For adjectives, only H-tone occurs (135.a). For verbs, both H- and L-tones can be
adduced (135.b-c).

b. ya$˘- ‘go’ (unsuffixed Perfective of stem ya&˘-)

c. ya$˘-go@- ‘go’ (Imperfective Negative)
3Pl ya$˘-go@-ba@, 2Pl ya$˘-go@-be@This process does not apply to 3Pl -ba and 2Pl -be in the unsuffixed Imperfective. In this case, Tone-Grafting (131) has already provided these suffixes3.7 Tones119with a tone, by associating the L-tone (i.e. the segmentally zero morpheme
expressing the unsuffixed Imperfective) with the suffixal mora (stem-L-ba >
stem-ba$); see (130.a).
The spreading of stem-tones onto an atonal suffix has analogues involving
certain clause-final particles, such as conditional-antecedent particle dey ‘if’
(136.a-b), interrogative ma (136.c-d) and quotative wa (136.e-f); cf. §3.7.1.8,
above. The last two may combine, in the order ma wa (136.g-h). The tonal
markings of the final particles in (136) are based on the most common pronunciation in the absence of special intonational effects. Note that the particle(s)
carry forward the final tone of the preceding verb.

Quot120PhonologyClause-final particles other than Quotative wa are subject to intonational
modification (§3.8.1). dey occurs at the end of a conditional antecedent clause
that is immediately followed by its consequent clause. Interrogative ma
typically occurs in polar (yes/no) questions and is arguably identical to the ‘or’
conjunction ma, suggesting the possibility that questions like (136.c-d) are cutoff interrogative disjunctions: ‘Did he/she eat, or [didn’t he/she eat]’. These
contexts for dey and ma lend themselves to nonterminal clause-final intonation,
in the form of prolongation () and/or raising (), which disguise the
(phonological) tone.
A further complexity is that when two such clause-final particles co-occur,
they may form an autonomous prosodic unit independent of the preceding verb
(and its tones). For example, (136.g-h) show verb-final tones spreading from the
verb to both following particles, but in (136.g) it is also possible to raise the
pitch of both particles due to intonation effects. I transcribe this as e.g. n)a&˘
n)E@˘-jE$-Ø ma$ wa$ in the case of (136.g)
The ‘if’ particle dey systematically appears as H-toned de@ in the
combinations de@ ke@ and de@ ne$, regardless of the tone of the preceding
morpheme (§16.1.3).
Clause-final intonational effects can also apply to verbs ending in 3Pl -ba
and 2Pl -be (after they acquire a tone by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading) in
the absence of a following particle. Moreover, when they occur in all-L-toned
words, under some conditions they (and other pronominal suffixes) may “grow”
a final H-tone; see §3.7.3.6, just below.
Postposition le$ (instrumental, dative, locative) is normally L-toned (§8.2.1).
It has an H-toned variant le@ in certain fixed combinations, always involving a
preceding H-tone, suggesting that tone-spreading has applied in these combinations. However, in cases like do@ju$ ‘under’, do@ju@ le@ ‘down below’, the
preceding word itself raises its final tone. We therefore have a chicken-and-egg
conundrum, and the tonal pattern of do@ju@ le@ does not lend itself to a simple
phonological interpretation (§3.7.1.8, §8.2.2).
Likewise, there are three basically purposive clause types involving final le.
In one, we get H-toned le@ after tone-dropped verb, so there is clearly no tonespreading here (§17.6.1.1). In the other two, the tone of le is identical to that of
the preceding syllable. In one construction, the verb shifts to all-H tone, and is
followed by H-toned le@. In the other, we get L-toned le$ after an unsuffixed
Imperfective verb, which always ends in a L-toned component (final L or F
syllable). In these last two constructions, le acquires its tone by spreading from
the left (§17.6.1.2-3).
We could therefore take certain cases of le (but not others) to be
intrinsically atonal and subject to the tone-spreading process.","[139, 140, 141, 142]"
"13.2.2 WH-interrogatives
The following subsections cover WH (content) interrogatives involving the
senses ‘who?’, ‘what?’, ‘where?’, ‘when?’, ‘how?’, ‘how much/many?’, and
‘which?’ They behave as focalized constituents, and are often (though not
always) followed by the Focus clitic y$. If the clause containing a WH-word
has a perfective positive verb, it normally occurs in the unsuffixed Perfective
(as usual in the focalization construction); examples include (766.a) and (772).
The WH-interrogative words most often occur clause-initially (if
topicalized constituents are excluded). However, other NPs and adverbials
(whether focalized or not) also occur in this position. The WH-interrogatives
may in fact follow another NP or adverbial that appears to be part of the same
clause, as in (766.a) and (773.a). I conclude that the WH-words remain in situ
rather than being (systematically) fronted.
The interrogative particle ma, most commonly found in polar interrogatives, is optionally used (redundantly) at the end of WH-interrogative
clauses, as noted in (761), above. Further examples are (768.b) and (770.a).

"10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs(582)369positivenegativelu@gu@ro@-jE$-m ‘I have searched’lu$gu$ro$-jE$-lu@-m ‘I have not searched’lu$gu$ro$-jE$-lu@-m could be used in replying to a question containing the -jE$suffix (‘have you already searched’), where parallelism between the question
and the response is called for. In other contexts, ‘I have not searched’ would
appear in simple Perfective Negative form as lu$gu$ro$-lu@-m ‘I did not search’.
PerfNeg -li@- does combine readily with the Experiental Perfect (‘have not
ever’). This is the usual way to express ‘never’. Here the Experiential Perfect
suffix -tE@rE$- is truncated to -tE- before -li@-, resulting in -tE$-li@-. The PerfNeg
suffix forces L-tone on both the ExpPf suffix and the preceding verb stem. The
irregularity in the form of -E@˘- ‘see’ with ExpPf suffix in the positive (E@t-tE@rE@instead of #E@˘-tE@rE@-) is carried over into the negative.

Reduplicated perfectives cannot normally be directly negated.
A reduplicated Perfective of a stative stance verb, e.g. i $-i@jE$- ‘be standing’,
is negated by adding the usual stative Negative suffix -la@- to the unreduplicated
stem, as in i j$ E$-la@-ba@ ‘they are not standing’. Likewise with adjectival verbs,
e.g. reduplicated positive ji -$ jo^˘- ‘be many’, negative jo$˘-la@- ‘not be many’.
A reduplicated Perfective of an active verb, e.g. ti -$ tE@mE$-w< ‘you-Sg
found’, normally has a simple (unreduplicated) Perfective Negative counterpart:
tE$mE$-lu@˘-Ø ‘you-Sg did not find’. However, in parallelistic positive-negative
sequences, a reduplicated Perfective Negative is possible.
For reduplicated Perfective ci -$ ce@˘ne$- ‘be well done, be good’, the normal
negative counterpart is the simple, unreduplicated Perfective Negative, as in
ce$˘ne$-li@-Ø ‘it is not well done, it is not good’. However, for this verb there is
also a parallelistic positive-negative construction, functioning as a “willy-nilly”
conditional antecedent (§16.3), that adds L-toned Negative -li $- to the
reduplicated Perfective stem (with no tone-dropping).","[390, 391]"

6.9AppositionThe sequence core NP plus numeral is structurally appositional, unlike other
superficially similar sequences like noun plus modifying adjective (including
ordinals). In the case of [NP + numeral], both the final word in the core NP and
the numeral have their regular tones; in addition, the NP has its regular (human)
Sg or Pl suffix, as it would in the absence of the numeral. When the NP in
question is head of a relative clause, tone-dropping applies simultaneously to
the final word in the core NP (the noun, or a following modifying adjective) and
to the numeral. For details and examples, see §6.5, above, and §14.1.3.
Apposition is also regular when a pronoun is “modified.” When a pronoun
(with human referent) is logically the head of a relative, it occurs to the left in
its independent (H-toned) form, in apposition to a form of i@ne@ ‘person’ which
follows. Only i@ne@ shows the tone-dropping characteristic of relative-clause
heads (397). I therefore bracket i@ne@ inside the relative clause, with the pronoun
outside the brackets. For more details, see §14.1.4.","[284, 285]"
"13.2.3 ‘Whatchamacallit?’
cE&˘ or ci $gE@ ‘thing’ is used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ filler noun with nonhuman

also be used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ phrase.

19.1.3 ‘Also, even’ (ka^˘<, ka@r<a$)
The morpheme meaning ‘also, too’ (see below for ‘even’) is usually heard as
ka^˘<, which can easily be confused with the distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each,
any’. However, the particle meaning ‘also’ has a variant ka@r<a$ that is not shared
with the quantifier. In addition, the ‘each, any’ quantifier occurs in a more
limited set of morphosyntactic combinations, e.g. with a preceding unmodified
noun or a preceding relative clause, and it induces tone-dropping in the
preceding word (§6.1.4, §6.8.1). The ‘also, even’ particle occurs after a wide
range of phrases and clause-finally, and has no tonal effect on a preceding
word.
ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ variants are interchangeable. However, ka@r<a$ seems to
occur chiefly after a pronoun or other NP. ka^˘< is more common in all positions,
but seems especially dominant in clause-final position (with clausal scope), and
in the high-frequency combination ka^˘< nE$ with nE$ ‘now’. The variant ka@r<a$
should be distinguished from the common verb ka@r<a@- ‘do’, which appears as
the form ka@r<a$-Ø in perfective relative clauses with Nonhuman head NP.
For examples of ka^˘< in the sense ‘also, too’ see (217), (280.b), (435.c),
(556.a), (641), (671.b), (740.b), (749), (795.b), etc. For ka@r<a$ in this sense see
(315.b), (1152.a-b).
The constituent that the ‘also’ particle has scope over is not always topical,
but it may be (1152).

The mi@ ka@r<a$ ‘me too’ in (1152.b) was repeated in a parallel passage later
in the same text as mi@ ka^˘<.
The sense ‘also’ is closely related to that of ‘even’, the only difference
being that ‘even’ presupposes the unlikelihood of one out of two (or more)
parallel events differing in at least one substantive component. The distinction is
made in English but not in Jamsay, where ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ may be translated
either way depending on context. The choice of translations is fairly arbitrary in
cases like ‘even today’ (= ‘today too’) following a discussion of past practices
(1153.a). The sense ‘even’ may be reinforced by ha^l ‘until, to the point that’
(1153.b).

This particle occurs with slight phonological variation in all languages of the
zone, and is even used in local French. It seems less common in Jamsay, where
it may be a fairly recent borrowing.
In (1175.a), the speaker responds with a trace of irritation to a vague
question about what kinds of song-and-dance festivities there are. In (1175.b),
the negation is emphatic.

This is the only occurrence of pE@y in my recorded texts, though I have
heard it in conversation. Elicitation brought out two other particles with similar
’(not) at all’ uses, fE@s and so@y. For so@y, whose more general sense is ‘all,
entirely’, see cf. §8.5.8.7.
fE@s is unusual in ending in a sibilant, a possibility restricted to interjections
(and poorly integrated borrowings). fE@s itself resembles ‘(not) at all’ particles in
some other languages of the region (e.g. Humburi Senni).","[700, 701]"

"12.2 Symmetrical comparatives
Symmetrical comparatives equate the scalar positions of the two comparanda.
Some of them occur most often under negation, the overall construction then
functioning as an asymmetrical comparison.
12.2.1 Predicative adjective with ji@n ‘like’
One semantically symmetrical comparative involves ji@n ‘like’ following the
comparandum. A following predicative adjective is regularly L-toned
(defocalized) in this combination. Pronominal-subject inflection is added
directly to the predicate adjective, with no ‘be’ quasi-verb.

A construction of the type [ADJx-la$ƒa@ ADJx-Neg] is used with adjectives to
mean ‘it’s not very (not particularly) ADJ’. There is no overt comparandum,
and the construction merely emphasizes that the entity in question is only
moderately characterized by the quality. -la$ƒa@ is invariant, while the negated
second adjective may be conjugated. Since it is part of a bipartite construction,
it is difficult to gloss -la$ƒa@ precisely; I use ‘so.much’ in interlinears.

12.2.3 ‘Equal; be as good as’ (ba&˘-)
ba&˘- can function as a transitive verb meaning ‘suffice, be enough for (sb)’, in a
full range of perfective and imperfective forms: mi@ ba&˘kç$ ‘it’s enough for me’,
mi@ ba$˘-go@-Ø ‘it isn’t enough for me.’
A homophone (or specialized offshoot) of this verb is used in comparatives,
in the perfective system only, in the sense ‘be as much as, equal’. It competes
with dç@˘- (do@˘-) ‘approach, attain’ in this sense; see §12.2.4, below. Unlike the
quasi-verbs and other stative verbs that are confined to the perfective system,
ba&˘- takes regular perfective system suffixes, including Resultative -sa$- and
Perfective Negative -li@- (rather than stative Negative -la@-). However, the
perfective forms are used for any time frame, and no morphologically
imperfective forms occur. For example, Imperfective Negative #ba$˘-go@- (in the
relevant sense) was rejected.
ba&˘ may be chained to a following VP that expresses the substance of the
comparison. In the absence of such a VP, the default interpretation is ‘be as
good as’. In most examples, ba&˘ occurs in negative clauses (‘not equal X’ =
‘be/do less than X’), but it may occur in positive clauses as well (740.d).","[471, 472]"

fiveIn (371.b), u$ro$ has L-tone because it is followed by an adjective, not
because of the phrase-final numeral. In (371.a-b), nu&˘y< ‘five’ is one of the
lexically R-toned numerals, which are optionally (but often) heard with L-tone
when they occur the end of a phrase. The R-tone of nu&˘y< is audible before
clitics and nonfinally in phrases, as for example in (395.a-b).
When a combination like (371.a-b) functions as head NP in a relative, both
the numeral and the preceding lexical-toned word drop their tones in parallel
(§14.1.3). In general, [noun + numeral] combinations appear to be syntactically
appositional (symmetrical) rather than hierarchical (asymmetrical).
Human nouns take their regular Pl suffix -m in combination with a cardinal

[lit., “Among those watermelons, we’ll buy five watermelons.”]6.6Plural (b
b e@ )The Plural particle be@ is related to 3Pl pronoun be@, and it is part of Logophoric
Pl pronoun E$nE@ be@. However, be@ has fairly low text frequency in Pl function in
nonpronominal (i.e. noun-headed) NPs. Most native Dogon human nouns can
take Sg -n and Pl -m, and the suffix preempts the need for a Plural particle.
However, most inalienable kin terms do not allow Sg -n or Pl -m suffixes, and
these do rely on be@ to express plurality: mi $ yE@s a^˘ ‘my (man’s) sister’, plural
mi $ yE@s a^˘ be@ ‘my sisters’. Other examples of nouns with Pl be@ are ja$msa&y be@
‘Jamsay (people)’ and borrowed nouns like conseiller be@ ‘councilors’ and
aventurier be@ ‘adventurers’.
For nonhuman nouns, plurality is an optional category and is usually not
expressed. However, Pl be@ is available when the speaker chooses to express
plurality overtly: i j$ u@ be@ ‘dogs’, versus simple i $ju@ ‘dog(s)’. Examples involving
inanimate nouns are in (375).

"8.3.2Simple and complex PPsA simple PP is of the form [X Postp], where the postposition is added directly to
the complement NP (cf. English in, at). A complex PP is of the form [X ma$
Postp], where Possessive ma$ intervenes. The postpositions used in the complex
type have a (syntactic) possessor as complement (cf. English in front of, ahead
of). Such postpositions probably all originated as nouns in tonal locative form.
The original construction was therefore of the type *[[X’s N]-Loc] (e.g. ‘on X’s
head’), where X was the possessor of the noun N, rather than the (direct)
complement of the locative marker.
In spite of this historical origin, there remains the question whether
complex PPs in modern Jamsay are still syntactically analysable as [[X’s N]Loc] with an embedded possessor, or have been reanalysed so that
[X ma$ Postp] with a purely formal Possessive morpheme now behaves like
simple [X Postp]. It is possible to test this by observing relativization patterns.
When a simple PP is relativized on, both the postposition and the final word of
the complement NP undergo tone-dropping (§14.6.1). When a complex PP of
the type [X ma$ Postp] is relativized on, two patterns are observed: a) both the
postposition and (the last word of) the complement NP are tone-dropped; b)
only (the last word of) the complement NP is tone-dropped (§14.6.2).",[313]
"656Anaphora18.3 Reciprocal
18.3.1 Simple reciprocals (tç^˘-n, tç^˘-m)
Reciprocal is expressed by the noun tç^˘-n (Singular) or tç^˘-m (Plural). The
Singular form is required when there are just two entities involved. When three
or more are involved, either the Singular or the Plural may be used. To the
extent that the Pl form is used when a minimum of three entities (e.g. speaker
and two other persons) is involved, the choice of grammatical number is based
on the perspective of one of the participants (‘me and the other one’ versus
‘me and the other ones’).
These Reciprocal pronouns are related to a noun meaning ‘comrade,
colleague’, which has the forms in (1129). Human suffixes occur only in the
presence of an overt possessor, as with some inalienable kin terms (§6.2.2). The
possessed forms may be treated as alienable, e.g. ma@ tç@w<ç@-n ‘my comrade’, or
inalienable, e.g. mi $ tç^˘-n ‘my comrade’ (§6.2.1-2). The F-tone in tç^˘-n is
compatible with the overlaid H(H…)L tone of inalienably possessed kin terms.

not a reciprocal here in the ordinary sense, I gloss it in its lexical sense
‘comrade(s)’, though the comradeship in question is rather attenuated (‘fellow

Preclausal topical phrases based on Nonhuman ko@ (here with discoursedeictic reference) are also common (§4.3.2). The phrase [ko@ ku$<] ‘that
(discourse-definite)’ is often used to preface new material that is somehow
contextualized by the preceding material. It may be loosely translated as ‘so, …’
or ‘that being the case, …’, but with no strong causal connotations. Like English
so, [ko@ ku$] is often used at the beginning of a question in the middle of an
interview; examples are in (1202) and (1205).
19.2.5 ‘Indeed’ (ha$˘si@n)

la$ƒa@ is also used to mark a major shift in topics (‘elsewhere, …’ or
‘meanwhile, …’). In (1164), it marks an interruption in a narrative sequence,
where the narrator moves back in time. The speaker has been describing how he

aunt.HLIn the combination of a nonpronominal NP possessor and a following

NP have at least one H-tone. When the larger syntactic context requires tonedropping, both drop their tones simultaneously to all-L, as explained above.
This is a general rule that also applies to compounds with H-tones in both initial
and final. For example, inalienably possessed sa@ydu$ tE^n ‘Seydou’s friend’
drops its tones in (340.a), since it is followed by NP-internal modifiers.
Likewise, when recursive inalienable possession is present, both possessed NPs
drop their already overlaid H(H…)L tones. This is seen in (340.b), where the
NP in question drops its tones as head of a relative.

"15.2 Adverbial clauses56915.2.7 Headless relative as adverbial clause
The logical head noun is sometimes omitted in adverbial relatives. It is difficult
to determine in this case whether the missing head noun is ‘manner/way
(that …)’ or ‘time (when …)’. Perhaps a locative sense ‘place (where …)’ is
also possible, though I can cite no compelling textual examples. Contextual
information and any available native wit must be used in translating such
headless adverbial relatives.
In (954), because of the immediately following ‘how?’ question, I opt for
‘the way …’ in the free translation, though a temporal reading is also possible.

2004.3.1815.2.8 ‘From X, until (or: all the way to) Y’
The verb ya$Na@ ‘take, pick up’ is widely used to initiate (and continue) a series,
especially in the combination ya$Na@ me$y<. It can take an NP or a clause as
complement. The series is normally concluded with a phrase containing some
combination of ha^l ‘until’, ya&˘- ‘go’, and/or dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’. The trope is
therefore of the speaker ‘picking up’ one or more objects and going (with it) to
a destination.
One version of the complete construction is seen in (956.a), with two ya$Na
me$y< opening the series of life stages of the millet plant, and a final ha^l ya&˘.
In (956.b), we have ya&˘ and dç@˘- without ha^l.

verb). There is otherwise no affix or other segmental change. The noun denotes
an entity that results from the action. See also the cognate nominals of trisyllabic stems described in §11.1.6.1, though most of the nominals in question
are not all-H-toned.
In (189.b), the noun is again all-H-toned, but is segmentally consistent with
a VblN. The actual VblN of trisyllabic verbs has LLH tone (da$nu$N-u@
‘preparing’, i $ji $-r-u@ ‘act of causing to stand’). The nominals da@nu@N-u@ and
i@ji@-r-u@ are therefore the result of overlaying the H-tone contour onto the VblN.
Note that the medial syllable in both the VblN and the H-toned nominal has a
high vowel; cf. VblN V2-Lenition (65).
In (189.c), bisyllabic CvCv- stems have trisyllabic H-toned nominals
ending in a suffix -gu@. If the stem-final syllable begins with a nasal, the suffix
appears as -Nu@, reflecting Nasalization-Spreading (48); compare the alternation
of Causative allomorphs -gv@- and -Nv@- in (528).
(189.d) has an apparent suffix -rv@.

no tonal modifications. However, in the contour-toned cases (144.b-c),
resyllabification has left behind a monotonal medial syllable. The stem-final
sonorant is now the onset of the word-final syllable. As syllabic onset, it is nonmoraic, and the tone it brings with it to the final syllable cannot be directly
expressed. However, this is moot since Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading
(137) has already copied the tone in question onto the nucleus of the final
syllable.

Resyllabification of the stem-final consonant has no tonal effect on the stemfinal syllable. In (145.b-c), on the other hand, resyllabification deprives the
stem-final syllable of its second tone-component, which is relocated into the
final syllable. The output be$ni^˘ with F-toned clitic instead of #be$ni&˘ $ with
final <LHL> is handled by Clitic <LHL>-Reduction (§3.7.4.7, below). For this
to work, however, it is first necessary to specify that a tone component
associated (after resyllabification) with a syllable-initial consonant is transferred
to the nucleus of that syllable.","[148, 149]"

recurrent practical activities (the work of blacksmiths and other artisans,
marriage customs, etc.). Therefore the reduplicated Imperfective competes in
the same aspectual domain with the unsuffixed Imperfective, the suffixally
marked Imperfective, and the Habitual.
As noted at the end of §10.1.2.7, above, except when followed by a syllabic
pronominal-subject suffix, (C)v@˘- verbs (H-toned monosyllables) have the form
Ci $-Cv^˘- in both the reduplicated Perfective with overlaid H(H…)L-tone and the
reduplicated Imperfective with final L-tone component grafted on. The two can
be distinguished when a syllabic suffix (3Pl -ba, 2Pl -be) is added. For R-toned
monosyllabic stems, and all nonmonosyllabic stems, no confusion is possible
even with -Ø or -C pronominal suffix.
10.1.2.10 Marked Imperfective (-tç@ƒç$-)
From inspection of textual examples, it is difficult to find consistent aspectual
distinctions between the unsuffixed Imperfective, the form with -tç@ƒç$- suffix,
and the form with -a@˘ra$- suffix. However, some tendencies do emerge.
In (572), -tç@ƒç$- occurs in passages describing recurrent activities. In
(572.a), note that de@˘- ‘carry’ occurs both in the unsuffixed Imperfective (de^˘-)
and the -tç@ƒç$- form, with no obvious difference in aspectual value.","[381, 382, 383]"

Logophorics may be used in clauses embedded within the quoted matter,
i.e. at one or more removes from the ‘say’ verb. In (1119.a-c), there is a
temporal adverbial clause (in the form of a relative headed by ‘day’). In the first
line of (1119.a), the relevant clause has a singular Logophoric, in subject
function. For other pronominal categories, preverbal subject in relative clauses
is expressed by L-toned pronominals (191), but for the Logophoric pronoun we
get E$nE@ with its regular tones (not #E$nE$). A second Logophoric occurs in
(1119.a) in the subsequent main clause as object of ‘have’.
In (1119.b-c), Pl Logophoric E$nE@ be@ (with regular tones) occurs in subject
function in the adverbial relative clause; see also (839). In the ensuing main
clause, repetition of the Pl Logophoric is optional (1119.b). This main clause
need not contain a mention of the referent in question (1119.c).","[670, 671]"
"256Noun phrase structureDefinite ku$< is common, for example, in tales where two or three animal

and is reestablished as local topic by a definite NP after Cat has taken center
stage briefly (probably in error). Another discourse referent, millet beer, is
introduced and is subsequently referred to in definite form. The passage also
contains a headless adverbial relative clause ending in ku$< (‘when he went’),
with scope over an unexpressed head noun like ‘time’, cf. (840.a) and (841.a-b).

"19.1 Topic
Jamsay discourse has many NPs (and adverbials) that precede the verb and any
preverbal subject or object pronominals. Many of these are best analysed as
topical expressions, and as we will see just below this status is sometimes
explicitly marked by a particle.
The issue arises whether a topical NP at the beginning of an utterance is
pre-clausal or clause-internal. The clearest indication that a topical NP is preclausal is when it s resumed by a pronominal (other than a pronominal-subject
suffix on the verb, which is obligatory in any event) in the clause proper. This
test is available for all non-subject categories such as direct object, postpositional complement, or possessor of any NP. In addition, a pre-clausal
topical NP is often prosodically set off (as indicated by a comma).
In (1147), the fact that topical [ko$ ke@] is sandwiched between sa@bu$ and the
rest of the clause, and the fact that Nonhuman ko$ is not resumed by a further
object pronominal ko@, suggest that the topical phrase is clause-internal.

‘(While he was working in the field,) A Fulbe herder came there
and encountered him.’ 2004.4.4Narratives that recount complex episodes from the past are replete with
such unsuffixed Perfectives. The AN category (perfective positive) is typically
predictable in such narratives. I suspect that this is a major reason why the
""defocalized"" unsuffixed Perfective is common in narratives. Some degree of
predictability of the verb stem’s semantic content is perhaps a contributing
factor. However, in cases like ‘stripped them off’ in (550.a), the verb denotes a
new event.
After a quotation, ‘say’ is rather light semantically. While the basic ‘say’
verb ga@˘- has a full set of AN forms including imperfectives, there is also a
common ‘say’ quasi-verb jE$- used only in the L-toned, unsuffixed Perfective
(§11.3.2).
All of this suggests that, within the perfective system, the unsuffixed
Perfective in main clauses is associated with verb defocalization. This is an
elusive concept, relevant to the grammars of many languages, but with much
language-specific detail. In Jamsay it involves any one of the situations in (551).
(551)a. the verb is part of a large defocalized clausal residue (when some
other constituent is focalized);
b. the perfectivity of the verb is contextually predictable and therefore defocalized (as in the middle of narratives where many events
are recounted in chronological order, in perfective aspect); perhaps
low information value of the verb’s own content is also a contributing factor;10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs347c. semantically “light” perfective quotative verb (‘said’) after
quotation.
The all-L tone pattern and the lack of overt AN suffixation can, in this light,
be considered to be iconic.
The expanded use of the unsuffixed Perfective, albeit with a different tone
pattern, in relative clauses might be interpreted as reflecting an overall reduction
in focal salience of the verb and other constituents in relative clauses.
There are analogues to the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective with predicative
adjectives and with negative verbs. When a predicative adjective is defocalized,
it not only drops its tones, but also omits the otherwise usual cliticized ‘be’
quasi-verb (§11.4.2). With negative verbs, the regular form (not defocalized)
has L-toned verb stem plus H-toned suffix (Perfective Negative -li@-, Imperfective Negative -go@-). Therefore the only audible cue to defocalization is that
the tone on the suffix drops to L-tone, as seen in (748) in §13.1.2 and (751) in
§13.1.3. There is no overt defocalization for positive imperfective verbs.
10.1.2.3 Marked Perfective (-ti $-, -yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-)
The suffixal (=marked) Perfective is used in positive main clauses where the
verb is not defocalized. The suffixed Perfective is almost always replaced by the
unsuffixed Perfective in relative clauses and related subordinated clauses.
There are two basic morphological types of Perfective (positive), one with
-ti -$ and one with -yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘-. The first is always a classic perfective, while
the second can be interpreted either as perfective in the same classic sense, or as
a resultative-stative.
The choice between the two major Perfective types depends chiefly on the
transitivity and (especially among intransitives) on the semantic type of the
verb. The division is summarized in (552). For perception verbs, which do not
readily co-occur with either Perfective suffix allomorph, see §10.1.2.4.
(552)-ti -$most transitives
active intransitives-yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-a few weak transitives (‘resemble’, ‘forget’)
(basically intransitive) motion verbs
(basically intransitive) stance verbs
intransitive (inchoative) adjectival verbs
other intransitive stative verbs348Verbal inflectionExamples of verbs taking -ti $- are: a) classic transitives cE@jE@- ‘cut’
(cE@jE@-ti -$ ), de$ne@- ‘want, love’ (de$ne@-ti -$ ), pa@ƒa@- ‘tie’ (pa@ƒa@-ti $-); and b) active
intransitives plus weak transitives that regularly take fixed “objects” such as
cognate nominals (gç@lç@rç@) dç$n)ç@- ‘snore’ (dç$n)ç@-ti -$ ), (ni@˘) i n
$ e@- ‘bathe’
(i n
$ e@-ti-), mç$w<ç@- ‘laugh’ (mç$w<ç@-ti -$ ), te@ge@- ‘speak’ (te@ge@-ti $), yi n
$ e@‘breathe’ (yi n
$ e@-ti -$ ), and pe@re@- ‘jump’ (pe@t-ti -$ , but with variant pe@y-ya$-).
I have no clear idea as to the origin of -ti -$ . It most likely has a common
history with ti@ as a linker (indicating a sequential chronological relationship)
among chained verbs (§15.1.16). There is some possibility of a more distant
connection with the transitive verb ti@˘- ‘send’.
The choice between -yE$-/-ya$- on the one hand and -a^˘- on the other is based
on the phonological form of the verb, as summarized in (553). Variation
between -yE$- and -ya$- is free; both occurred in my tapes in the speech of
individual informants, and it was often difficult to distinguish them.
(553)a. -yE$-/-ya$monosyllabic Cv˘syncopating bisyllabic (C)vrv-, (C)vr<v- (before phonological
contractions)
b. -a^˘nonsyncopating bisyllabic stems
trisyllabic and longer stemsThe allomorph -yE$-/-ya$- perhaps derives historically from ya&˘- ‘go’. Indeed,
many of the verbs taking -yE$-/-ya$- are motion verbs. It seems unlikely that
allomorph -a^˘- is historically related to the phonologically similar verb a@˘‘catch’, but -a^˘- might have some historical connection to (the onset of) the
Habitual suffix -a@˘ra$- in the imperfective system.
Monosyllabic stems with -yE$-/-ya$- include dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’ (dç@˘-ya$-),
go@˘- ‘go out’ (go@˘-ya$-), be@˘- ‘stay, live’ (be@˘-ya$-), ni@˘- ‘sleep’ (ni@˘-y<a$-), na@˘‘pass the night’ (na@˘-y<a$-), and ya&˘- ‘go’ (ya&˘-ya$-).
Syncopating bisyllabic stems (those of shape Cvrv- or Cvr<v- ) that take
-yE$-/-ya$- include yE$rE@- ‘come’ (ye&y-ya$-), ga$ra@- ‘pass by’ (ga&y-ya$-), lo@ro@- ‘get

(mç&y<-y<a$-), and u$rç@- ‘go up’ (u&y-ya$-). On Post-Sonorant Syncope (60), which
(with two exceptions not relevant to this section) applies only to CvCv- stems
with short vowels and with medial rhotic r or r<, see §3.5.3.2.
Nonsyncopating bisyllabics with -a^˘- include na@Na@- ‘forget’ (na@N-a^˘-),
ti@me@- ‘resemble’ (ti@m-a^˘-), nu$mo@- ‘fall’ (nu$m-a^˘-), su$go@- (su$g-a^˘-), di N

(do$n)-a^˘-).
Trisyllabic examples are ko@mo@n)o@- ‘became wrinkled’ (ko@mo@n-) a^˘-),
na@Na@-r<a@- ‘remember’ = reversive of ‘forget’ (na@Na@-r<-a^˘-), and ba$na$-r<a@‘become red’ (ba$na$-r<a^˘-).
The rare combination of-yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘- with a syntactically transitive verb
is illustrated in (554). The few verbs in question are the very epitomes of wimpy
transitivity.

themselves to either the (classic) perfective or the stative-resultative reading.
Thus ni@˘-y<a$-Ø can mean ‘he/she went to sleep’ (perfective, event completed
before time of reference), or ‘he/she is sleeping’ (stative-resultative, state
continuing into the present). Motion verbs favor the straight perfective reading,
though of course a completed motion event also creates a state. Thus go@˘-ya$-Ø
‘he/she went out’, contextually also ‘… has gone out’ = ‘… is out, is not here’.
Adjectival stative verbs also favor the perfective (in this case inchoative)
reading, e.g. ‘became red’, but for a different reason, viz., the adjective itself is
used predicatively to denote a timeless state: predicate adjective ba@nkç$ ‘it is
red’, intransitive perfective ba$na$-r<-a^˘-Ø ‘it became red’ or ‘… has become
red’.
The fact that the Perfective suffixes can differentiate transitive and
(intransitive) stative verbs makes it easier to understand why Jamsay has so
many ambi-valent stems that can be transitive or intransitive. For example,
do@mno@- ‘finish’ has two Perfective forms, each associated with a particular
valency: do@mno@-ti -$ in transitive function (‘X finished Y’), but do@mn-a^˘- in
intransitive function (‘Y came to an end’). Likewise, with an inchoativefactitive pair of deadjectival verbs, du$gu$-no@-ti -$ must be interpreted as transitive factitive ‘X fattened Y’, while du$gu$-n-a^˘- can only be intransitive
inchoative ‘Y became fat’.","[366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371]"

The basic relative clause pattern has an internal head NP (marked by tonedropping), and a participle agreeing in gender-number features with this head
NP (rather than an inflected verb agreeing in all pronominal features with the
clause subject). Modifying adjectives and cardinal numerals remain with the
internal head NP, but some other NP-final elements (e.g. Definite ku$<, Plural
be@, universal and distributive quantifiers) follow the participle. The participle
itself therefore behaves somewhat like an adjective modifying the head noun in
several respects (recall that modifying adjectives also force tone-dropping on
the modified noun, and precede the NP-final elements mentioned above).
It is also possible to expand this core relative clause structure (ending with a
participle and perhaps one or two NP-final morphemes) by adding a copy of the
head noun (not the full head NP), as a special kind of external head.
Specifically, this copied noun is “possessed” by the relative-clause proper,
which functions here as the possessor NP (and is therefore followed by
Possessive ma$). The complete construction may be suggested (crudely) by a
structural paraphrase, whereby ‘a/the dog that I saw’ is expanded as as ‘dog of
[a/the big dog that I saw]’, though of course the linear order in Jamsay is very
different (with the external ‘dog’ at the end). The copied external head noun is
optional, and occurs in fewer than half of relative clauses occurring in my texts,
but it is nonetheless quite well-attested.
The internal head NP is occasionally omitted, whether or not the external
head is present. This results in an internally headless relative. However, in
such cases it is reasonable to think of a “light” head noun (such as ‘person’,
‘thing’, ‘place’, ‘time’, or ‘manner’) as being virtually present, though
phonologically inaudible. Furthermore, the participle agrees with this virtual
head: (human) Singular, (human) Plural, or Nonhuman. We can therefore think
of the agreement morpheme on the participle as a stand-in for a full head NP,
just as subject-pronominal suffixation on the verb of a main clause can function
as “subject NP.”
Thus the maximal relative-clause construction might be described as
double-headed. However, the Jamsay construction (when examined in detail) is
rather unique, and I question how useful it would be to assign it to a general
“double-headed” typological category.","[499, 500, 501]"
"476Focalization and interrogation13.2.4 Embedded interrogatives
In this section I consider interrogative complements to main-clause verbs like
‘know’, as in ‘I don’t know (whether/who/what …)’.
An embedded polar interrogative clause (‘whether or not …’) is a simple
quotative complement (§17.1), plus the usual clause-final interrogative particle
ma. The particle distinguishes an embedded interrogative (‘I didn’t know
whether …’) from a factive complement (‘I didn’t know that …’), although the
Jamsay embedded interrogative construction may be used (as complement of
‘know’) where English would use the factive complement. Examples are in
(795).

where English speakers would use a factive complement. This is the case in
(796.a), above, which would more naturally be expressed as ‘… who knows that
it was I …’ in a free English translation.
Embedded WH interrogatives may be of two types. In one, the regular
WH-word is used, with optional clause-final interrogative particle ma. This
type approximates direct discourse, except for deictic substitutions such as
logophoric pronominals, where appropriate (797).

‘I don’t know how much they paid.’This type, with the regular WH-word, is preferred for embedded ‘how
much?’ and for embedded ‘who?’. In the first case, this may be for lack of a
suitable nominal counterpart (‘amount’, ‘quantity’). In the second, the
preference may be due to avoidance of ambiguity between e.g. ‘I don’t know
who lives here’ (identificational knowledge) versus ‘I don’t know the person
who lives here’ (acquaintance).
The second possibility for embedded WH interrogatives is the literal type
exemplified by “I don’t know the place in which he is” as the translation of
English ‘I don’t know where he is.’ That is, a generic noun like ‘place’, ‘time’,
‘manner’, or ‘thing’ is the head of a relative clause, which (as a syntactic NP)
functions as direct object of ‘know’ or other main-clause verb. There is no overt
interrogative element.","[497, 498, 499]"
"Given the Constraint Against All-L-Toned Stems (99), one could consider the
possibility that one or another of the attested lexical tone patterns is a default,
applied to underlying L-toned stems in order to satisfy the constraint. I do not
favor this (pure) constraint-satisfaction model, but if I did I would suggest finalmora H-tone as the default. In this view, which I will call the default-finalmora-H analysis, verbs with (monosyllabic) R, bisyllabic LH, trisyllabic LLH,
and so forth, are reinterpreted as having no lexical H-tone, with the final mora
secondarily acquiring H-tone to satisfy the constraint. The same would apply to
nouns, adjectives, and numerals that have L-tone up to a final H-toned mora.
Possible evidence for this applicability of the default-final-mora-H
approach to nouns is provided by a small numer of human nouns that normally
(and in some cases exclusively) occur with Sg -n or Pl -m. The stems in
question have a final R-tone in these suffixed forms, and the suffixal nasal is
required to permit expression of the H-tone component of R (i.e., <LH>). The
four known examples are ç$ƒç&-n ‘chief, Hogon’, sa$ƒa&-n ‘chief’s subordinate’,
dç$ƒç&-n ‘Dogon (person)’, and su$rgç&-n ‘weaver’ (plurals ç$ƒç&-m, sa$ƒa&-m,
dç$ƒç&-m, su$rgç&-m). ‘Chief’ has an unsuffixed form ç$ƒç@ ‘leader (e.g. of animal
pack)’, with final H-tone replacing R-tone, and ‘Dogon’ has an unsuffixed form
dç$ƒç@ meaning ‘Dogon language’, while ‘chief’s subordinate’ and ‘weaver’ do
not occur without suffixes. In the default-final-mora-H analysis, these stems are
underlying all-L /ç$ƒç$/, /sa$ƒa$/ , /dç$ƒç$/, and /su$rgç$/, and the final mora secondarily acquires H-tone, for example in unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ and in suffixed ç$ƒç&-n.
A theoretical objection to this argument is that e.g. unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ ‘leader’
can also be derived from /ç$ƒç&/ by a simple tone rule converting R to H tone on a
final monomoraic syllable; see Final-Cv R-to-H Reduction (154), §3.7.4.6,
below.
Additional grist for this debate comes from tonal relationships between
underived and suffixally derived stems; see below, §3.7.3.1.
In the sections that follow, I will suggest an autosegmental model for
Jamsay tone, while acknowledging the existence of a few counterexamples to
the rules proposed. In its strongest form, an autosegmental model of tone
separates the segmental tier from the tonal tier. Strictly speaking, the segmental tier must itself be organized into syllables, moras, and feet, but since
these are derivable from the segment string I will speak loosely of these as
elements of the segmental tier.
A stem, or a word, consists of non-null strings of segments and of tonecomponents. Curly brackets {…} will be used for strings of H and L components at stem or word level. For example, u@ro@ ‘house’ consists of uro at the
segmental level and {H} at the autosegmental level, while its tonal locative u@ro$3.7 Tones97‘at the house’ has the same segments but a bitonal {HL} tone pattern. Both the
segmental and tonal tiers may be morphemically complex.
For this model to work perfectly, there must be rigorous association
processes that connect the tone components H and L to the correct syllables
and/or moras. These processes are easy to formulate when the tonal tier is
monotonal, i.e. just {H}, since of course in this case the H component will
associate to all syllables (and moras) at the segmental level; i.e., it will spread
throughout the stem or word. The rules are also easy to formulate when the
number of tone components, the number of syllables, and the number of moras
all converge, for example bitonal {LH} for a CvCv stem. Complications arise
with bi- or trimoraic syllables, since now the association rules must decide
whether to associate tone components with syllables or with moras. The
challenges increase to the extent that the number of tone components is mismatched with the number of relevant segmental-tier units (syllables or moras).
For Jamsay, no pure autosegmental model will work perfectly for all wordclasses. However, it is possible to develop a model that works well for verbs,
and that helps explain statistically important patterns for nouns.","[118, 119]"

a morphosyntactic context that requires tone-dropping (i.e. flat, low pitch). The
issue does not arise in connection with noun-adjective sequences, since e.g. ‘big
dogs and big cats’ does not reduce (in Jamsay) to ‘big [dogs and cats]’, where
the adjective has scope over a conjoined (core) NP.
When a conjoined NP functions as head NP in a relative, however, there is
a potential conflict between the curvacious dying-quail intonation contour, and
the tone-dropped flat pitch required by the larger morphosyntax. The issue is
often avoided by using parallel relative clauses: ‘the man who was here, and the
woman who was here’ (instead of ‘the man and the woman who were here’). As
a result, I have no clear textual examples with conjoined NPs as relative-clause
heads. However, I was able to elicit such examples.","[292, 293]"

Jamsay/Gourou j/g, as in (1188.a), above, there are many j/z and j/s correspondences. The known cases of the j /z correspondence are in (1189); note that

Where cognates in other northern Dogon languages are known to me, the

pattern, seen in (1189.a), is Nn=Be=Nj j (matching Jamsay) but Wa=Ta z688Dialects(matching Gourou). Using Beni (for which the current data are fairly complete)
as diagnostic, a smaller number of cases involve Beni s (1189.b), z (1189.c), or
other (1189.d), and there are several sets where no cognates outside of Jamsay

complicated by loanwords from Fulfulde (often of Arabic origin) which are set

usual comparative pattern is that Nanga, Beni, Walo, and Tabi have s (like
Gourou) while Najamba has j (like Jamsay) (1190.a). This suggests that Jamsay
and Najamba have merged two originally distinct consonantal phonemes into j,
while the other languages preserve the distinction (Gourou/Walo/Tabi z versus
s, Nanga/Beni j versus s). In a few cases, the comparative data suggest an
original nasal-initial cluster (1190.b). No comparative data are yet available for

correspondence is largely confined to stem-initial position; a few representative examples are in (1192.a). “Stem-initial” for this purpose includes position
after an initial reduplicative syllable (1192.b). The forms for ‘sneeze’ (1192.c)
are probably cognate (one dialect or the other has metathesized), so this may be20.3 Comparative Jamsay-Gourou phonology691a case of intervocalic position, but of course a raspy sibilant is effective as an

comparative evidence points to original clusters of a nasal plus a sibilant or *j

Wa cognate is known, there is a split between z (1193.a) and less often s

"3.7 Tones109This problem can be easily resolved within either the default-final-mora-H
analysis (mentioned but not endorsed in §3.7.1.5, above), or the autosegmental
model that I prefer. In the former, the verbs in (120.b) are underlyingly L-toned.
Both the simple stem and the derivative undergo a late rule creating an H-tone
for the final mora, in order to satisfy the constraint (99) against all-L stems.
In the autosegmental model, the difference between (120.a) and (120.b) is
that the autosegmental level has (lexically specified) {H} in the first case and
bitonal {LH} in the second. In the latter, it is then necessary to specify that the
H is associated with the final mora of a verb stem, as already stipulated in
(113.c) in §3.7.1.7, above. The interesting point is that this association is postderivational; that is, it applies to suffixally derived stems in the same way as to
underived stems. There is no evidence for cyclical application. The derivations
of bu$ro@- ‘be revived’ and its causative are in (121), omitting detail about
vocalism that is not relevant here.

tonal associationPhonology of H(H…)L and H(L…)L tone overlaysThere are two {HL} tone overlays: a) the widespread H(H…)L and b) the more
restricted pattern H(L…)L that occurs in the first stem in one type of verb-stem
iteration. The two overlays are audibly distinct only with verbs of three or more
syllables. Take, for example, ga$ma$r<a@- ‘divide, share’. The H(H…)L overlay is
realized as HHL in the unsuffixed Perfective ga@ma@r<a$- in relative clause
participles. In the relevant iteration pattern, H(L…)L appears in the first part of
(and indeed the whole of) ga@ma$r<a$-ga$ma$r<a$.
The existence of two distinct {HL} overlays is obviously a problem for an
autosegmental approach to Jamsay tones, and perhaps to any other “phonological” approach. However, there is a clear asymmetry. H(H…)L occurs
widely in Jamsay, turning up in multiple grammatical contexts involving all
lexical word classes.
The H(L…)L pattern occurs in one verb-stem iteration pattern that may
involve up to three L-toned stem iterations following the initial H(L…)L
occurrence (§11.6.3). For example, a trisyllabic verb with two iterations has a
tone pattern HLL-LLL-LLL. The iterations have clearly undergone tonedropping, erasing lexical tones, but one can argue that the tone-dropping begins
with the second syllable of the first occurrence, hence H[LL-LLL-LLL]. This,110Phonologyplus the initial H-tone (which is not lexical), suffice to characterize the tones of
this iteration construction. This is a unique, global tone pattern overlaid on the
entire sequence of stems, not a stem-specific overlay like that for all of the
H(H…)L overlays. Moreover, this iteration pattern is stylistically marked, being
typical of narrative style, unlike the stylistically neutral constructions that
require H(H…)L overlays.
… )L is clearly the phonologically regular instantiation of
Given that H(H…
{HL} in tone overlays, the question arises whether the association rules for this
overlay are the same as those for basic stems of autosegmental type {HL} as
described above. The central generalization for tone-component association for
stems, extracted from (113.c) in §3.7.1.7, above, is repeated here as (122).
(122)associate final L (preceded by H) to the final moraFor example, the basic lexical forms of {HL} noun stems with a final bi- or
trimoraic syllable are overwhelmingly …F rather than …L in form. For
example, the (C)vCvC segmental shape has 18 cases of lexically HF-toned
(C)v@Cv^C against zero cases of HL #C)v@Cv$C, see (104) in §3.7.1.3, above. The
asymmetry extends to trisyllabic stems, e.g. of shape (C)vCvCvC, where we get
a total of 8 …F stems including 5 HHF (C)v@Cv@Cv^C against one …L stem,
which happens to be of shape CvCCvCvC (107).
To see whether the grammatical H(H…)L overlay is consistent with this,
we must review how it applies to mono-, bi-, and trimoraic stems. To do this,
we must piece together an overall picture from facts gleaned from the individual
subtypes.
For inflected verb stems, the H(H…)L overlay occurs in unsuffixed
Perfective participles (in relative clauses). The input-output relations are
indicated in (123). The overlay is limited to stems, disregarding pronominalsubject suffixes (which have no intrinsic tones and so will eventually acquire
their surface tone by low-level rules). All inflected verb stems of more than one
syllable end in a Cv@ syllable (not Cv@˘ or Cv@C), so we do not have a full range of
syllabic types. The lexical tones of the inputs are irrelevant to the outputs so
they are not indicated here.","[130, 131, 132]"

A postpositional complement NP, as opposed to the full PP, cannot in general

allow such focalization. This postposition has other unusual traits suggesting a

Perfective (a category that, for regular verbs, is associated with the presence of
a focalized constituent). The fact that postposition jE@ drops its tones after a
focalized constituent in (754) points to its verb-like status.

As I tentatively interpret (756) in context, at the outermost level the entire
constituent ‘the ones who leave Gourou’ is the focalized “subject” of ‘be the goand-come women’. Within the subject relative ‘the ones who leave Gourou’, the
village name Gourou is also focalized. However, focalization of a constituent
within a relative clause is quite rare, and the single example above might have
other explanations (including a false start).
An interesting diagnostic is that Existential yE@ does not occur in relative
clauses with the quasi-verbs and defective verbs (‘be’, ‘have’, etc.) that require
it in positive main clauses (in the absence of another focalized constituent). I
have argued that yE@ is a kind of default focalized constituent used with these
predicates (§11.2.2.1), and its absence from relatives supports the view that
relatives are not conducive to internal focalization.","[479, 480, 481, 482]"

ko@ro@-wo@- appears to have metathesized from expected #ko@wo@-ro@-. The last326Verbal derivationitem in (525.b) shows r< in the input and n…r< in the output; see discussion of
(49) in §3.5.1.2.
The set of bisyllabic inputs in (525) shows a limited range of medial C2: 3
cases of g (including ƒ), 4 of r, 2 of r<, 12 with nasals, and 2 with w. A similar
range is found with the -rv@- allomorph of the causative (see below).
In addition to the examples given, where the reversive sense is fairly clear,
there are many verbs in the lexicon whose shapes (e.g. Cv1Cv1 rv1-, Cv1llv2-)
are compatible with reversive morphology. In a pair like ga$ma@- ‘reduce’ alongside ga$ma$r<a@- ‘share, divide’, there is a hint of possible reversive semantics,
but the relationship is not transparent. A similar case is da$Na@- ‘patch up’ and
da$Na$r<a@- ‘cut crosswise, cut (sth long) in half’. With ko@llo@- ‘take off, doff
(garment)’, there is more than a hint of reversive semantics, but from ku@r<o@‘put on, don, wear (garment)’ we would expect reversive #ku@l-lo@ rather than
ko@l-lo@-. It is unclear whether tç@˘-rç@- ‘unwind (thread)’ is directly related to tç@˘<‘wind, coil’ (one would expect nasalized reversive #tç@˘-r<ç@-). In many other
cases there is no attested simplex verb, so demonstrating reversive morphological status is impossible synchronically. See also (541.a), below.
Reversive verbs, and certain other verbs denoting reversible actions that
have no (audibly distinct) morphological Reversive, may be followed by go@˘‘go out’ or by gç&˘<- ‘take out’ depending on the sense (i.e. valency). For
example, both gç$Nç@- and gç$Nç$-r<ç@- occur in the simple sense ‘encircle, surround’. The Reversive ‘dis-encircle’ (i.e. go away after having surrounded
something) is always gç$Nç$-r<ç@-, but since this is ambiguous the reversive sense
can be made clearer by the combination gç$Nç$-r<ç@ go@˘-.
9.2Deverbal causative verbsBefore proceeding, brief mention may be given to verbs borrowed directly from
Fulfulde causatives. These are all-H-toned verbs ending in …i@nE@- or …i@ne@(the choice depends mainly on harmony with preceding vowels). These contain
the Fulfulde Causative formative -in- plus the -E (-e) ending that is normal in
verbs borrowed from Fulfulde.
I distinguish (deverbal) causative, (deadjectival) factitive, and denominal
verbalizations. However, the distinctions between causative, factitive, and other
transitive derivations are somewhat fuzzy, and there is much overlap in the
respective morphologies. For an interesting pseudo-causative (actually a
nominal syntactically) formed with suffix -wv$, see below, §9.3.
For the causative strictly speaking, there is a basic choice between four
basic suffix allomorphs -wv@-, -gv@-, -rv@-, and -nv@-, all with an underspecified
vowel v. The w and r consonants become w< and r<, respectively, due to
Nasalization-Spreading (48) under phonologically regular conditions. One9.2 Deverbal causative verbs327should not confuse -rv- as a minor Causative allomorph with the productive
Reversive suffix -rv-.
In most cases, the tones of the causative are predictable from those of the
input; see §3.7.3.1. The known exceptions are in (526); all are H-toned monosyllables with LH-toned causatives. The productive Causative suffix -wv@- is
represented three times (526.a); see also passive E$˘-wE@- ‘be seen’ from E@˘- ‘see’
in §9.4. Four cases (526.b) involve a less common Causative suffix allomorph
-nv@-.

shapes ranging from mono- to trisyllabic. Representative examples are in (527).

V2-Raising (59). In (528.b), the medial vowel is idiosyncratically syncopated.
Summing across (528), we have the following C2’s: 3 r, 1 w, 2 w<, 1 y<, 2 g.
The causatives with suffix -Nv@- (528.d-f) are phonologically difficult, but
all have a nasal in the preceding syllable, whereas there are no stems with a
nasal in this position in causatives with surface -gv@- (528.a-b). This suggests
that Nasalization-Spreading (48) has converted /g/ to N ; see (189.c) for a
similar alternation in an unproductive nominal derivation. In (528.c), sa@y<-Na@is semantically as well as morphologically specialized, and it co-exists with a
semantically and morphologically regular causative sa@y<a@-w<a@-. Syncope to
(C)vC- before the derivational suffix connects sa@y<-Na@- (528.c) to the two cases
of Syncope in (528.c), reinforcing the view that -gv@- in (528.a-b) and -Nv@- at
least in (528.c) involve the same underlying suffix allomorph.
To account for the even less transparent (528.d), consider the possibility of
taking the underlying suffix allomorph to be -nv@- rather than -gv@-. (See below
for more cases of -nv@-.) An underlying /su@gu@-no@-/ (the vocalism is regular), in
this analysis, undergoes metathesis of /g…-n/ to /n…-g/, then NasalizationSpreading (48) converts the /g/ to N, producing the observed consonantal
sequence n…-N. For the key step (metathesis), see (52) in §3.5.1.2. The same
phonological pattern is seen in wa$na$-Na@ ‘become/make distant’, inchoative and
factitive of adjective wa$ƒa@ ‘distant’ (§9.6, below). However, this brings to only
three the set of derived verbs with this consonantal alternation, and the
phonological derivation I have suggested cannot be very transparent to native
speakers. A similar analysis with -nv@- might work, though, for (528.e), where
however the final shift would be a kind of fortition from w< to N.
Another phonologically difficult pattern is seen in (529).
(529)inputglosscausativeglosswa$ja@-‘be left over’wa$ƒa$-ja@-‘cause to be left over’The same consonantal alternation is seen in noun we@je$ ‘craziness’,
denominal verb we$ge$-ja@- ‘become crazy’ or ‘drive (sb) crazy’, see §9.7, below.
If the final -jv@- in these two derivatives is taken to be a surface variant of
allomorph -gv@-, an allomorph seen clearly in e.g. bu$ru$-go@- ‘revive’ (528.a),
above, metathesis can again be posited. Thus underlying /Cv$jv$-gv@-/ becomes
/Cv$gv$-jv@-/. If the vowels are from the set {a ç}, the /g/ becomes ƒ by
g-Spirantization (32). This accounts for wa$ƒa$-ja@- in (529); see (51) in §3.5.1.2
for fuller discussion.
There are some semantically causative derivatives with a third suffix
allomorph -rv@-, identical in form to the productive Reversive suffix seen above,
though the verbs in question do not have reversive derivatives. All known330Verbal derivationexamples are in (530). This -rv@- is cognate to Tommo-So Causative -r(Plungian 1993a:392-3).

of /r/ to r< conform to the patterns seen with other causatives. The C2 distribution is as follows: 2 g, 1 j, 1 n, 1 N. This C2 pattern is similar to what we saw
above with reversive -rv@-.
tE@mE@- ‘find’ has a regular causative tE@mE@-w<E@- and an irregular one
tE@m-nE@-. Both are used in contexts like ‘cause (e.g. problems) to find (sb)’, i.e.,
‘bring (troubles) upon (sb)’. tE@m-nE@- is homophonous to the deadjectival
factitive tE@m-nE@- ‘soak, make wet’, cf. adjective tE&m ‘wet’. It may be that
tE@m-nE@- was resorted to for ‘cause to find’ to distinguish this causative from the
common passive derivative tE@mE@-w<E@- ‘be found’ (§9.4, below).
Finally, there are a few Cv$˘-nv@- causatives with a fourth basic suffix
allomorph, -nv@-, which is cognate to Causative -nd- in Tommo-So (Plungian
1993a:392). Two or them are based on input stems with medial r or r< (531.a),
one (somewhat opaque) is based on one with medial N (531.b), and the two
others are based on monosyllabic Cv@˘- inputs (531.c). All have LH tones, which
is expectable in (531.a-b) but not in (531.c), given the input tones.

‘grind up’The n of the -nv@- suffix seems to have had something to do with the
idiosyncratic deletion of the medial rhotic in (531.a) and of the medial N in
(531.b). Some irregular nouns may have likewise lost a medial rhotic before Sg
-n. In any event, the loss of a medial consonant creates an intermorphemic
vowel sequence that must be contracted. See VV-Contraction (90) (§3.5.6.2).
The rather lexicalized ga$˘-na@- ‘take across’ competes with a regular
causative ga$ra$-wa@- ‘allow to go across’, with a slightly different nuance.
I suggested just above that the type su@go@- ‘go down’, causative su@nu@-No@‘take down’ (528.d), may involve underlying suffix allomorph -nv@-. We will see
below that -nv@- is common in deadjectival verbalizations.","[346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353]"
"14.5 Possessor relative clause513There is no problem in forming human participles (with audible suffixes)
based on the negative ‘it is not’ construction, since here the Participial suffix is
added to Negative la$˘ (allomorph la$-) rather than directly to the ‘it is’ clitic.
Therefore in (858) ‘woman’ appears in tone-dropped form, as head of a relative
clause.

Possessor relatives are covered here, since their structure is relevant to the
discussion of relatives based on complex postpositions (§14.6.2, below).
Three constructions are possible for possessor relatives. In the first,
recorded once in a text, the possessor noun undergoes tone-dropping. Possessive
ma$ is not present. In (859), i n
$ e$ ga$sE$gE@ could be mistaken for a compound
(L-toned initial, lexical-toned final), but this would make no sense. Perhaps this
uncommon first construction is a slightly truncated version of the third (see
below). If so, i n
$ e$ and ga$sE$gE@ in (859) should be considered as two constituents
that just happen to be adjacent, rather than as constituting a single constituent
(possessed NP).

2004.4.25In the second construction, obtained in elicitation (see below), the regular
possessed NP phrase [X ma$ Y] ‘the Y of X’ is preserved intact, except that (as
relative head) the possessor X undergoes tone-dropping (860.a).
In the third construction, observed in a text and in elicitation (see below)
and evidently the productive pattern, the possessor is extracted (or at least
separated) from the possessed NP phrase and placed to its left (not necessarily
directly adjacent). This possessor NP (as relative head) undergoes tonedropping. Its original place within the possessed NP phrase is occupied by a
resumptive third person possessor (Singular, Plural, or Nonhuman) in its514Relativizationregular form (H-toned for alienable, L-toned for inalienable possession). The
resumptive pronominal is not Reflexive/Logophoric in form.
In elicitation, my assistant gave (860.a) and (860.b) as interchangeable.
(860.a) has the second construction with [X ma$ Y], while (860.b) illustrates the
more common third type showing extraction and a resumptive possessor
pronominal.

In this productive extraction construction, the possessed noun may be
separated from the possessor by an adverb (862.a) or by another NP (862.b). In
(862.a), the resumptive pronominal possessor is omitted, perhaps because in this
context ‘eye’ is an abstraction for ‘vision, ability to see’. In (862.b), my

14.6.1With simple postpositionIn PP relatives, only the NP complement of the postposition is logically
relativized on, as is brought out by English translations with stranded
prepositions (‘the housex that I live in __x’). However, in Jamsay, both the
postposition and the complement NP undergo tone-dropping. The usual
general features of relativization are also applicable: Participial suffix on the
verb agreeing with the head, preverbal L-toned subject pronominal, and
H(H…)L tone overlay on a (positive) unsuffixed Perfective verb.
The first set of examples (863) involve the all-purpose postposition le$
(§8.2.1). Since le$ is already L-toned, we cannot observe audible tone-dropping
on it, but tones are audibly dropped on the preceding noun (or noun modifier).

If the preposition has at least one H-tone, tone-dropping on the postposition
(as well as on the complement NP) is audible. This applies to spatial

The alternative is a resumptive construction of the type ‘a thingx that poison
is not [in itx]’ with a simple L-toned head noun (‘thing’) and an ordinary
pronominal PP. An example is (687), above.

14.6.2 With complex PP of type [NP ma$ Postp]
Consider now what happens when the postposition is separated from its
complement NP by an intervening Possessive morpheme (ma$). This occurs
with a number of spatial postpositions that take complements in the form of
“possessors.”
In (866), an intervening ma$ does not prevent tone-dropping from applying
to both the complement NP ‘house’ and to the postposition ‘in’. Here, then, the
complex PP pattern [NP ma$ Postp] is treated exactly like the simple PP pattern
[NP Postp] discussed above.

taken as evidence that there are two distinct types of “complex PP,” both of the
form [NP ma$ Postp]. One type, e.g. with bE$rE^˘ ‘in’ and the other postpositions
illustrated in (866), behaves syntactically like a simple PP. The other, my only
clear example being ku^˘<, behaves like a possessed NP phrase. This in turn
suggests that ku^˘<, but not bE$rE^˘ et al., is still treated synchronically as a
denominal tonal locative (§8.1), and therefore as itself a kind of mini-PP.
Textual examples where ku^˘< can plausibly be glossed concretely as ‘on the
head of’ (as in ‘it fell on me’) provide additional evidence that ku^˘< is still
closely connected by native speakers to the source noun ku@˘< ‘head’. The
synchronic connection between bE$rE^˘ ‘in’ and the original source noun bE$rE@
‘belly’ seems weaker.
This reasoning leads to an analysis of [X ma$ ku^˘<] ‘on NP’ as structurally
[[X Poss head]-Loc], i.e., ‘on X’s head’. Here the NP complement X functions
as possessor of ‘head’, not (directly) as complement of the Locative postposition. We have seen in §14.5, above, that in one attested construction, a14.6 PP relative clause519relativized possessor remains in place and simply drops its tones, with no
change in the possessed noun. This is consistent with the tone-dropping pattern
in ‘what she will sit (=live) on’ in (867.a), above.
Parallel to ‘on the head of’ (867), above, is (868), where the “postposition”
is overtly a PP on its own.

Def15 Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clausesThe first part of this chapter (§15.1) is about chaining VPs (or verbs) together.
The second part (§15.2) is about various explicitly adverbial clauses, chiefly
those that specify temporal relations. Some of these are special cases of relative
clauses, including an important type (“headless” relatives) with a virtual head
NP that takes Nonhuman participial agreement on the verb (§15.2.7). The
chapter concludes with a brief section (§15.3) on special cases of Possessive
ma$.
15.1 Chaining
The term “chaining” will be used for combinations of VPs (sometimes reduced
to simple verbs), such that the nonfinal verbs occur in infinitival (=bare stem)
form with their lexical tone, which depending on the verb is either all-H or
L(L…)H. The VPs in question have a shared subject, which facilitates the
reduction of one clause to just a VP. The final verb in a chain is inflected for
aspect-negation categories, and usually for subject pronominal category.
Chaining covers a range of phenomena involving various degrees of
integration. At one extreme, we have two or more completely separate VPs
chained together, sharing a subject and implying some sort of temporal or
causal relationships, but with no other formal clause-level integration. At the
other extreme, we have a kind of verb-verb compounding, where a pair of verbs
functions like a single verb, with a single set of arguments and adverbial complements.
Closely related to VP-chaining in form and function is a VP-linking
construction with particle me$y< (§15.1.14, below). There is also a similarity to
constructions with main-clause verbs like ‘want’ that take complements in the
form of VPs ending in bare stems (§17.5).
15.1.1 Tone-dropping of medial chained verb (v# v$ v#)
When three (or more) verbs are chained together without separating material, a
verb in the middle of the chain optionally appears in L-toned form (869). In
(869.c), if the linker ti@ (§15.1.16) is considered to be a verb there are four verbs
in the chain, and the two medial ones including ti@ drop their tones..","[534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542]"
"3.2.2Embryonic metrical structureMany languages have stress or accent systems, which generally have at least a
partially undulating, rhythmical nature (alternating stress rules, clash avoidance,
etc.). Jamsay is a tone language, whose tones are important both lexically and
grammatically. Unlike the case in other (non-Dogon) tone languages of the area,
in Jamsay there is no “tone sandhi” across word boundaries. In native
vocabulary, long words may consist entirely of metrically light, monomoraic Cv
syllables. For these reasons, there is no phonetically obvious metrical structure
of the sort we observe in English.
However, an embryonic metrical structure is manifested in various
phonological rules, particularly those applying to verb stems and their suffixal
derivatives (including Verbal Nouns). The core sequence involved is a steminitial bisyllabic [] foot behaving metrically as a trochee [sw], i.e., with a
metrically strong 1 followed by a weak 2. Squared brackets demarcate
metrical feet. Depending on the phonological process in question, there may be
further stipulations on one or both of these syllables (e.g. as to vowel length), or
a following third syllable may be required. There is no clear evidence for
metrical structure in the third, fourth, and fifth syllables of long, uncompounded
stems or words.
The phonological processes that are at least arguably sensitive to the initial
[sw] asymmetry are those in (28). For each, I give a brief summary (often
oversimplified) of the content of the process, name the morphological
categories affected, and a schematic representation of the relevant structure3.2 Internal phonological structure of stems and words27(with the targeted segment underlined). In the schemas,  is used for a syllable
that can be of any shape, i.e. initial (C)v(˘)C and noninitial Cv(˘)C, while more
specific representations like (C)v (optional C plus short vowel) are used when
the process requires.

f. Presuffixal V2-Raising (§3.5.2.2)
process: mid-height V2 {e E) or (o ç} raised to i or u
domain: suffixally derived verbs (e.g. causative)
relevant structure: [Cv]-[Cv-(28.a) is a consonantal lenition that occurs at the onset of 2 (but not e.g.
3). (28.b-e) are vocalic deletions and other lenitions. (28.b,d) are strictly
limited to 2, (28.c) is very strongly associated with 2 though it applies rarely
(in elicitation only) to later syllables; and (28.e) can apply equally to 2 or a
later syllable but there are very few opportunities for it to apply to a later
syllable. (28.f) is not obviously a lenition process, but since raising is associated28Phonologywith lenition in (28.e) one could make a case that (28.f) too is a lenition of sorts;
it applies only to 2.
The relevant structures in (28.a-f) are sufficiently divergent to show that no
fixed “underlying” metrical structure can account for all the data. 2 is always
centrally involved, but the lenitions are in some cases extended to immediately
following syllables. Only (28.a,d) affect stems of all word classes, while
(28.b-c, e-f) apply only to verb stems (including Verbal Nouns derived from
them).
If the metrical structure were better developed, one would expect some kind
of undulating stress, so that e.g. a five-syllable word would have an audible
organization into metrical feet, e.g. [sw][sw] (with extra-metrical final
syllable). This is not the case.
A probably related tone-lowering occurs in the second verb stem in certain
types of chains, including iterations (repetitions) of the same stem. This tonelowering applies at the level of words (or stems), not syllables. See §15.1.1 and
§16.6.2.","[48, 49, 50]"
"10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs351I use the label “Resultative” with misgivings. This is not a classic stative
resultative. That sense can be expressed by the marked Perfective (particularly
the allomorphs -yE$-/-ya$- and -a^˘-). The nuance with -sa$- suffix seems rather to
be this: the fact that the event that has taken place is of some continuing
relevance.
One empirical observation is that -sa$- is the regular positive perfectivesystem form of perception verbs E@˘- ‘see’ and a@ƒa@- ‘hear’. These verbs cannot
take Perfective -yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘-, and informants showed considerable aversion
to combining them with Perfective -ti $ -. Except for Experiential Perfect -tE@rE$- in
the sense ‘have (n)ever seen/heard’, these verbs consistently appear with -sa$- in
perfective contexts. Cognitively, what distinguishes perception verbs from most
other verbs is that the agent (seer, hearer) rather than the patient (object seen or
heard) is altered by the act of perception. One can think of ‘X see/hear Y’ as an
event that results in a cognitive state in the perceiver.

nature, and is terminated when the contingent eventuality is brought about.

10.1.2.5 Experiential Perfect (-tE@rE$-) ‘have ever’
This suffix directly follows the stem. It is usually directly followed by the pronominal-subject or Participial suffix, but it may be followed by Resultative -sa$or Perfective Negative -li@- (560). The preceding verb stem has its lexical tones.

Resultative
Perfective Negative-tE@rE$-tE@s-sa$-tE$-li@- (see §10.1.3.2, below)10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs353-tE@s-sa$- is from /-tE@rE$-sa$-/ via Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) and Rhotic
Assimilation (77). Using the same phonology, one would have expected Perfective Negative #-tE$l-li@- with geminated lateral, but instead we get -tE$-li@-.
The one lexical idiosyncracy is that E@˘- ‘see’ has a high-frequency Experiential Perfect E@t-tE@rE$- instead of #E@˘-te@rE$-.
The Experiential Perfect is glossable ‘have (ever)’, or in connection with a
negation ‘have (never)’. Though most common with perception verbs E@˘- ‘see’
and a@ƒa@- ‘hear’, it can also be used with e.g. motion verbs (‘I have never gone
to Bamako’). The interlinear abbreviation is “ExpPf.” Examples are in (561).

In the Dogon variety spoken in Beni, there is a verb jE@- meaning ‘finish
(doing)’ that is used with a preceding chained verb with a sense not far from
recent perfect. This makes me suspect that Jamsay Recent Perfect -jE$- might not
be directly equatable to the ‘say’ quasi-verb -jE$- (§11.3.2) and its relatives.
10.1.2.7 Ci -$ Reduplicated Perfective
A verb may occur with Ci $- reduplication, in both perfective and imperfective
systems. Vowel-initial stems have i $-. The same Ci $- reduplication pattern
occurs (less often) with imperfective verbs, which have different tones
(§10.1.2.9, below). Ci $- (variant Cu$- before Cu˘… stem) is also found with
some noun stems as a (usually frozen) initial segment (§4.1.5).
The reduplicated Perfect is is based on the H(H…)L form of the unsuffixed
Perfective (as found in relative clauses). There is no AN suffix, but regular
pronominal-subject suffixes are added. The reduplicated Perfective ci -$ ce@˘ne$‘be well-made, be good’ has a distinctive negative form ci -$ ce@˘ne$-li@- used in
“willy-nilly” constructions (§16.3); see (584) in §10.1.3.3, below. The use of
Perfective Negative suffix -li@- is further evidence that this reduplicated type
belongs to the perfective system. No other verb is attested in this reduplicated
negative form. The usual negative counterpart of the reduplicated Perfective is
the (unreduplicated) Perfective Negative with L-toned stem followed by -li@-.
With stance verbs, the reduplicated Perfective is used for resultative-stative
sense: i $-i@jE$- ‘be standing (=in standing position)’, di $-da^˘<- ‘be sitting
(=seated)’. Likewise with ‘shut’ and ‘open’, hence pi@ne@- ‘shut’ (transitive),
pi@-pi@ne$- ‘(e.g. door) be shut’.
In some textual examples the precise aspectual value of the reduplicated
Perfective is difficult to determine. In most cases (perhaps all) there is an
element of duration or iteration. All textual examples (excluding repeats with
the same verbs) are given in (565).","[372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377]"

Unlike the case with tonal locatives, the H-tone component is never
deleted on the final input vowel, even when, as in (128.c), it is part of an
autosegment extending over at least the last two syllables. This is the crucial
phonological difference between the unsuffixed Imperfective and the tonal
locative.
The unsuffixed Imperfective is followed either by pronominal-subject
suffixes (e.g. 1Sg -m, 3Sg -Ø, 3Pl -ba) or, in relative clauses, by Participial
suffixes (Nonhuman -Ø, Sg -n, Pl -m). These suffixes may have the shape -Ø,
-C (nasal), or -Cv, and all are atonal (they lack intrinsic tones of their own). The
tone patterns of the -Ø and -C cases can be handled by simple, lower-level tone
rules. With -Ø suffix, the final vowel of the unsuffixed Imperfective must be
prolonged by an extra mora where necessary to permit all tone components to
be expressed; this is the case in (128.b-d) but not (128.a); see Contour-Tone
Mora-Addition (141), §3.7.4.1. With -C suffix, the contour tone is realized over
the entire resulting bi- or trimoraic syllable; see Rightward H-Spreading,
§3.7.4.4.
The atonal -Cv suffix is more interesting phonologically. The two suffixes
in question are 3Pl -ba and 2Pl -be. Consider the data in (129).

column) expresses the grafted L exclusively on the 3Pl suffix, so the preceding
syllable is H- or R-toned as per its lexical form. In the cases of (129.b-c), it
would be possible to first graft the L onto the stem-final syllable, allow the L to
spread to the suffixal syllable by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137), and116Phonologythen simplify the stem-final syllable to R in (129.b) and to H in (129.c) on the
grounds that these syllables do not have enough moras to express their
respective contour tones, see Contour-Tone Stretching (143) (§3.7.4.2, below).
Objection: there is no purely phonological reason why /ti^˘-ba$/ ‘they will
send’ should reduce its stem tone from F to H to produce ti@˘-ba$. We do in fact
get a surface F-tone before 3Pl -ba$ in combination with Perfective suffix
allomorph -a^˘- (§10.1.2.3), as in na@N-a^˘-ba$ ‘they have forgotten’. Since a long
F-toned vowel can be pronounced before a -Cv$ suffix, I reject a derivation of
H-L ti@˘-ba$ via F-L /ti^˘-ba$/ . This suggests that Tone-Grafting onto the stem-final
syllable does not, as such, take place when a nonzero suffix is present; rather,
the floating L initially located between the stem and the suffix attaches itself to
the suffix (i.e. to the right) rather than to the stem (to the left). Thus the
derivation I prefer for ti@˘-ba$ is (130.a), not (130.b). However, a derivation
similar to that in (130.b) does occur when the unsuffixed Imperfective is
followed by the clitic kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’, as in ti@˘kç$ ‘it will send’; cf. (150)
and (569).

"4.7.2.2Other ordinals (suffix -nE@)For numerals above ‘1’, ordinals are expressed by adding a suffix -nE@. The
preceding numeral (including composite numerals like ‘eleven’) drops to L-tone
within a level, but if there is a mix of levels (with elements from two or more of
the sets ‘1-99’, hundreds, thousands, and/or millions), tone-dropping does not
cross the phrasal boundary separating two levels. Thus tone-dropping affects the
simple numerals in (247.a-b,d), and the tripartite but single-level numeral in
(247.c), but it affects only the final part of the complex numeral in (247.e),

require tone-dropping on the noun (§6.1.4). This is suggestive of compounding,
since the initials in some noun-noun compound types also drop their tones. In
this section, I discuss phenomena that are more obviously compounds in nature.
A number of formulae for tone patterns are distinguished in the sections
below, using “x” for a compound initial of variable word-class, “a” for
adjective, “n” for noun, “v” for verb, and Ppl (as usual) for Participial suffix. A
macron (e.g. in “x#”) means that the constituent in question retains the same
tones that it has in isolation. A grave accent (“x$”) means that all tones in the
relevant constituent are dropped to low. An acute accent (“x@”) means that all
tones are raised to high, and a circumflex (“x^”) denotes an overlaid H(H…

7.1.1NP conjunction (‘X and Y’) by dying-quail final intonation7.1.1.1Non-iterative NP conjunctionConjoined NPs, including pronouns, are juxtaposed without an overt conjunction. The normal articulation is with a dying-quail intonational ending on
both conjuncts. That is, the final syllabic nucleus of each conjunct is prolonged
with a slowly falling pitch (§3.8.3). Dying-quail intonation is indicated by 
after the relevant word, which is otherwise transcribed with its ordinary tones
and vowel-length.
This intonation pattern is most conspicuous when both conjuncts are short,
as in pronoun conjunction (401).

‘you-Sg and us’In (401.a), for example, the conjunction is pronounced [wo@o#o,$ ko@o#o$] with
exaggerated lengthening and a long, arc-ing pitch decline on both conjuncts,
and with an intonation break in between. This is standard for pronominal
conjunctions.
A pronominal conjunction [X Y] behaves like a nonpronominal NP. In
particular, when the conjoined NP as a whole functions as (alienable) possessor,7.1 NP coordination267the pronominals take their usual independent form, and the NP is followed by

weakly audible to inaudible. In (406), the special intonation is clear in the initial
conjunct (a pronoun), which suffices to characterize the construction as a conjunction, even though the expected  following the longer second conjunct was
not audibly realized.

"8.1Tonal locatives8.1.1Tonal locative of noun stemA small number of noun stems may be used, as locative adverbs, with an extra
L-tone component grafted onto the end, which results in a final F-toned
syllable or in a …HL contour on the final two syllables. There is no (other)
postposition. In spite of the final F or HL pattern, the tone contours here are
distinct from the exaggerated “dying quail” final intonation pattern (§3.8.3) that
is used with conjoined NPs and for words followed by fu@˘ ‘all’.
The cases of tonal locative known to me, excluding similar forms confined
to greetings, are listed in (436). The inputs are of the following types: …HH
(436.a), monosyllabic Cv@˘ (436.b), …LH (436.c), monosyllabic Cv&˘ (436.d),

‘after, behind’Phonologically, the tonal locative is formed by adding an L-tone at the end
of the input noun, which docks on the noun’s final syllable. The only similar
process is the addition of an L-tone at the end of verb stems to form the
unsuffixed Imperfective stem. In interlinears, the notation “…Loc.HL” will be
used. For the phonology in detail of these two formations, see Tone-Grafting
(§3.7.3.3).
There is a shred of evidence to the effect that the tonal locative, at least in
specific cases, may still function morphosyntactically as a postposition. See
discussion following example (867), below.

Ordinarily, tonal locatives may only be formed from nouns, rather than
from modifiers such as adjectives or numerals. (For a rare exceptional case
where a modifying adjective takes tonal locative form, see §8.1.3, below.) The
noun must also be in NP-final position, i.e. not followed by an adjective,
numeral, or particle (including Definite ku$<), with a possible exception
discussed below.
In a tonal locative, the noun may be preceded by a possessor NP and/or a
compound initial (438.a).

inThe noun u@ro@ ‘house’ and its tonal locative u@ro$ are ordinarily distinguishable. As compound initials, in the main noun-noun compound type with
tone-dropping on the initial, they would both merge as u$ro$-. In e.g.
[a$ƒa$-u$ro$]-ta&N-Ø ‘(bride’s) transfer to her husband’s home’, a compound
ending in a Verbal Noun, the associated VP is a$ƒa$-u@ro$ ta@Na@- ‘move to the
husband’s home’. One could argue, therefore, that the compound initial
[a$ƒa$-u$ro$]- is really a tonal locative whose basic ...HL tone contour has been
erased by an overlaid tone contour. Again, there is no way to demonstrate this
directly.
The adverbial phrase nu$mo@ nu$mo@ ‘hand to hand’, cf. nu$mo@ ‘hand’, is
used with a verb like ‘give’, indicating that someone delivered something in
person to the recipient (not through an intermediary). For close combat, the
expression used is ‘chest to chest’, which has the same structure: gç$Nç@286Postpositions and adverbialsgç$Nç@ cf. gç$Nç@ ‘chest’. I take these to be conjunctions of iterated nouns (e.g.
‘hand and hand’), rather than as iterations of tonal locatives.
In situational greetings associated with an activity or location (‘well’,
‘work’, ‘market’, etc.), the noun specifying the location in question has a tonal
form consistent with that in tonal locatives. See (1185) and comments there.
Some postpositions are, or probably originated as, tonal locatives of nouns.
In (439), the HL contour converts a noun into a postposition, with a more
figurative sense than in the preceding cases. The complement takes the form of
a possessor. Textual examples are in (440).

ka^n is shown by the fact that (921.d), above (‘after another newlywed bride
came’), was repeated by the speaker, after the taping was briefly interrupted,
with ga@˘ ka^n instead of just ka^n.
Perhaps ga@˘ ka^n originated (like jE@ clauses) as a quotative construction
(‘after X said that a lion has ravaged the animals’), where the act of saying
entails that the protagonists have processed the event in question; see §17.1.
However, in many textual passages there is no suggestion of actual speech or
thought by any discourse referent, and simple free translations like ‘after a lion
had ravaged the animals’ are usually best. To whatever extent the construction
is still felt (by native speakers) to involve quotation (or thought), the source of
the quotation is abstract and impersonal. Therefore ‘say’ in this construction
does not entail the use of logophorics, and the clause preceding ‘say’ has a verb
in bare-stem form, whereas a normal quotative complement has an inflected
verb (§17.1.2).

Another adverbial clause type apparently involving a ‘say’ verb ends with jE@, or
more often jE@ me$y<. Before proceeding, a comment on phonologically similar
morphemes may be helpful. It is likely that some or all of the forms in (924.a)
are historically related, but their connection with those in (924.b) is
questionable.

-jE$-‘holding; with’, reduced from ji@jE$ in chains (§15.1.17)
Recent Perfect suffix (§10.1.2.6)Here we are concerned with jE@ and the more common jE@ me$y< in adverbial
clauses. I will gloss jE@ as ‘say’ on the theory that it may still be synchronically
connected to the inflected jE$- ‘say’, and for lack of a better translation. In this
analysis, jE@ is the (bare) lexical form of the ‘say’ verb, which otherwise appears
as L-toned unsuffixed Perfective jE$-. In this analysis, jE@ ‘say’ is chained to the
following clause, with or without me$y<.
Adverbial clauses ending in jE@ (me$y<) have a range of morphosyntactic
forms. The variables are a) the expression of pronominal subject, and b) the
form of the verb if it is perfective (positive). There are two basic types
involving inflected verbs, i.e. verbs with at least AN marking (925). See (931)
below for an uncommon pattern involving bare verb stems.
(925)pronominal subjecttone of unsuffixed Perfectivea. quasi-main-clause type
suffix on verball-Lb. quasi-relative-clause type
L-toned preverbal pronounH(H…)LType (925.a) is consistent with main-clause form in most respects. However, the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective in main clauses is elsewhere associated
with the presence of a focalized constituent, which is not the case in jE@ clauses.
Type (925.b) is consistent with relative-clause form in most respects.
However, no audible Participial suffix is present on the verb. One might argue
for a Nonhuman Participial suffix -Ø, which would require us to assume a
covert nonhuman head; I will not adopt this suggestion.
The quasi-main-clause type (925.a) is less common. The clear examples of
this construction have perfective-system verbs or statives, as in (926). I interpret
structurally similar examples involving imperfective (or imperative) verbs to be
purposive clauses (§17.6.2). Note the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective verbs in
(926.a-b) and the presence of regular pronominal-subject suffixes throughout.

When (uninflected H-toned) jE@ combines with following te@ge@ ‘speak’ as in
(926.b) and in (1236), it is particularly difficult to separate the subordinator jE@
from the unattested #jE@ that arguably underlies unflectable L-toned jE$- ‘say’.
Perhaps (927) belongs here. The predicate with H-toned jE@ is a noun with
clitic y$ ‘it is’ (allomorph i^˘).

pronominal is more common. It is exemplified in (928). Note subject pronominals throughout, and in (928.a-b) the perfective H(H…)L contour (usually
bisyllabic HL). Another perfective example is the first line in (458.a). There is
no audible participial suffix, but this is interpretable as Nonhuman -Ø. In
(928.a), both of these features are observable in the jE@ me$y< clause. In the jE@
clause that follows, still in (928.a), the verb (‘look for’) is imperfective, so only
the preverbal subject pronominal tells us that the quasi-relative type is at hand.
Similar imperfective clauses occur in (928.c-e). Simple jE@ is present in (928.b),
while the other examples have jE@ me$y<.","[570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575]"

addition of a derivational suffix to the input stem. Inflectional suffixes follow
the derivational suffix.
The suffixal vowel in the reversive, causative, and other derivatives with
-CV- suffixes is an unspecified short vowel. It gets its vowel quality by featurespreading from the preceding vowel (i.e. the final vowel of the input stem). This
is true even when the preceding vowel is subsequently itself syncopated or
raised to become a high vowel. For the phonology, see Suffixal VowelSpreading (57) (§3.5.2.1) and Presuffixal V2-Raising (59) (§3.5.2.2).
The suffixes in question will be represented as -rv@-, -wv@-, -gv@-, -nv@-, etc.,
where “v@” represents the unspecified short vowel. This vowel is always
H-toned, but this is predictable since all verb stems end in a H-toned mora.
If the input verb is all-H-toned, so is the suffixed derivative. If the input
verb is of the type L(L...)H, with only the final mora high-tones, this pattern is
also extended to the suffixed derivative. For example, a bisyllabic HH input
corresponds to a HH-H derivative, while a LH input has a LL-H (note: not #LHH) output. (There are a handful of counterexamples to this nonetheless robust
generalization.)
This phonological relationship between input and derived verb stems lends
itself to an autosegmental analysis, where input verbs may be {H} or {LH}, and
these lexical contours are independently (i.e. noncyclically) applied to suffixal
derivatives, with the final H in {LH} always associated with the final mora.
-rv@- and -wv@- appear as -r<v@- and -w<v@-, respectively, when preceded by a
nasalized vowel or by a syllable beginning in a nasal or nasalized consonant, by
regular application of Nasalization-Spreading (48) (§3.5.1.1).","[343, 344, 345, 346]"
