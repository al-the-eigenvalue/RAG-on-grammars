"4.5.3Use of ɲagFor short responses or an answer to a yes/no question, Jarawa uses the negative
particle ɲag at the beginning of the negative response, followed by the negated
sentence. For instance, the negative response to the yes/no question given in
(4.70) would be (4.71).(4.70) ka
INTMŋa-kajapečame2POSS-motherdieHas your mother died?(4.71) ɲag

An affirmative response of (4.70) is presented in (4.73).",[185]
"5.4.14 Question particle
Jarawa employs the question particle in yes/no questions. However, this question
particle also has (limited) use in content questions (wh-questions). The examples
(5.40) and (5.41) demonstrate the use of the question particle in yes/no questions
of verbless clauses while examples (5.42) and (5.43) show the use in yes/no
questions of verbal clauses.

"4.7 Interrogative clauses
Interrogatives in Jarawa are of two types: ‘yes/no’ questions and wh-questions.
In first type, the interrogative marker ka is used at the beginning of the sentence,
while in the second type question words (interrogative pronouns) are used to
create the interrogative. However, there are some instances where the
interrogative marker is used even in wh-questions. All these structures are
described in the following sub-sections.
4.7.1Yes/no questionsThe schema of a yes/no question is presented in (4.81).
(4.81) ka + [subject]NP + {[object]NP} + Verb]]VP ?
In (4.81), object has been put within the curly bracket (to show optionality) since
intransitive verbs do not take an object. However, instead of an object some
peripheral arguments like a spatial NP may come between the subject NP and
the verb.",[188]
"However, the use of the question particle in content questions is limited. Mostly
content questions are formed with the question word in situ. The examples (5.46–
5.48) illustrate the usual way of forming content questions, where question
words are employed without the question particle.",[234]

the interrogative marker. Consider example (3.20).

"7980This raises the question as to whether the hypothesis that “mi” forms are subjects
and “ma” forms are objects is valid. It is also difficult to say whether it is an
idiolectal variation. In the present study there is no answer to this issue.
However, the usage of “mi” forms in object position is limited to a few instances
in the present corpus. Also, as far as “ma” forms are concerned, they can never
occur as subject of the clause. Thus, we assume in the present study that the
distinction between these forms is as hypothesised.","[97, 98]"
"There is one example in the corpus which shows that the question particle may
be used in between the noun phrase and the question word. In example (5.49)
cajwaj ‘name of a girl’ is a noun phrase and ʈʰucəʈəgə ‘where’ is a question word,
and question particle comes in between the two. The example given in (5.49) can
be articulated without question particle as given in (5.50). It is surprising that
here the question particle cannot be used in the beginning of the sentence; the
use of question particle at the beginning of the clause in (5.51) makes the
sentence ungrammatical.

"Negative particle: It is also used with the negative particle naɖem ‘not’. {ʈʰi}is employed with negative particle when the negative particle is used for a short

In (3.120a) there is a question and we get the response as in (3.120b). However, it
is not essential to get the question like (3.120a) everytime, and hence the meaning
of the sentence can be derived from the context in which the conversation is
carried out.

"4.7.2Wh-questionIn wh-questions in Jarawa, some NPs in the clause are replaced corresponding
question words (interrogative pronouns/adverbs). The wh-words stay in situ, i.e.
the question word used for the subject NP would stay in canonical subject
position and the question word used for the object NP would stay in canonical
object position. Other question words (interrogative adverbs like when and
where) also appear in canonical positions. Interrogative sentences with whwords explored below.
1. onne ‘who’
The question word onne ‘who’ is used for humans. It can be employed for the S
argument of an intransitive verb, the A argument of a transitive verb, and an
indirect object (including benefactors).

"228229To express negation, this language makes use of an independent word naɖem
after a predicate (verbal or verbless), or a suffix -ma on a verb. There was no
semantic difference observed between the two. We saw that the independent
word naɖem could be used across the board while the suffix -ma had restricted
use.
Imperatives are formed by using the verb with its core argument. As we saw,
there is no morphological marking to differentiate imperatives from other kinds
of sentences.
In interrogatives, we looked at yes/no questions and wh-questions, which differ
syntactically. Yes/no questions are formed by placing the interrogative marker ka
at the beginning of a clause, while in wh-questions the wh-word occupied its situ
position. The use of the interrogative marker with some wh-questions was also
found.
In the category of complex sentences, I explored coordination and complement
clauses. A conjunction ən ‘and’ was found to be used to express coordination. In
coordinated clauses, it was found that conjunction ən ‘and’ can be employed at
phrase level and clausal level to form coordinated clauses.
Two different kinds of complement clauses were also discussed. These two types
of clauses were clause internal and clause external complement clauses. In a
clause internal complement clause, the complement clause occurs within the
main clause in the object position of the verb phrase. Clause external
complement clauses were described as instances of direct speech in this
language. Since the language was found to be SOV, meaning the object occupies229230the slot before verb, these kinds of constructions were considered as clause
external complement clauses.
Direct speech and cleft constructions were established as types of complex
constructions found in Jarawa. It was suggested that there is only direct speech
in this language (based on pronominal correlation). Cleft constructions were
found to have two sub-types: ɖi-constructions and ʈʰi-constructions. The former
suggests referential/definiteness of the entity referred to, and the latter
indefiniteness of the entity referred to.
The morpheme ɖi was shown to have two different usages in this language. One
usage is to indicate definiteness/referentiality, and the second is to express
grammatical relation. Referentiality was treated in this dissertation as applicable
when the entity referred to is within sight of the speaker-hearer. Definiteness,
then, is applicable when the entity referred to is not within sight but the speakerhearer has shared knowledge. . However, some restrictions were found on the
use of this morpheme. It never occurs with pronominals and postposed Os. It can
occur only with lexically headed S or O arguments of a clause. This morpheme
was also seen employed with interrogative pronoun onne ‘who’ and clause
internal complement clauses. In the case of the interrogative pronoun onne ‘who’,
the cleft construction is formed.
The way this morpheme is employed in this language also indicated that this
morpheme expressed grammatical relations, i.e. ergative-absolutive system. The
languageemployssplitergative-absolutivesystem.","[246, 247, 248]"

There are some cases where the interrogative marker ka is employed in this type
of wh-question, as shown in (4.100). It was not ascertained why ka appears in
such cases. The ordering of the interrogative marker and other constituents of the
clause is as we have in other interrogative constructions, where we have
interrogative marker in the beginning of the clause followed by other
constituents.

Some constructions involve the structure SUB + INTM + question word. These
constructions mostly contain the subject NP and the question word for ‘where’.
For example, in the sentence (4.102) there is a subject NP čajwaj and question
word ʈʰučəʈəgə, consequently we have ‘cajwaj ka ʈʰučəʈəgə’175176(4.102) čajwaj
CaywaykaʈʰučəʈəgəINTMwhereWhere is Cayway?
This sentence can also be formed without ka:
ʈʰučəʈəgə(4.103) čajwajCayway where
Where is Cayway?
Putting the interrogative marker ka at the beginning of the sentence causes
ungrammaticality. For example:
(4.104) * ka

4.8 Complex sentences
The present corpus shows evidence of coordination, and of direct and indirect
speech. There is no substantial evidence for complex sentences involving
subordination. Distinguishing between direct and indirect speech is difficult
since no complementiser or any particle is used in such constructions.","[192, 193, 194]"
"In (4.107) there are clearly two clauses with two verbs, each verb takes evidential
marker. In (4.109) only the main verb takes evidential marker. They also seem to
be embeded within one another. If they are two clauses embeded within one
another, we need to answer the question raised in (4.110). As we will notice again
in section 4.9, ɖi is a marker of definiteness/referentiality and it also specifies
grammatical relations. This morpheme is generally used with nominals
functioning as either S argument or O argument. It is also used with the nominal
which is IO of the clause. Since this morpheme is definiteness marker, we cannot
179180rule out the use of this morpheme with the nominal in A argument position but
the corpus reveals a seldom use of ɖi with nominal in A argument position.
Based on these facts we may infer that ɖi is used for the clause [ujijə]NP [ɖ-ipaleyə]]VP treating it as an NP. Is it a plausible answer? It is still open for further
research. The second problem poses a grave problem. Since bəᵼʈʰe is an
intransitve verb it cannot take an object NP. Dixon (2010) proposed three criteria
to identify a complement clause which is reproduced in (4.111).
(4.111)
(I)It has the internal structure of a clause, at least as far as core arguments
are concerned.","[197, 198]"
"Two questions raised by this discussion are given in (4.110).
(4.110)(a) What is the reason for using ɖi with bəᵼʈʰe in this clause?
(b) bəᵼʈʰe is an intransitive verb, and hence it cannot take an object
NP or a complement clause.",[197]
"Spatial adverbs: It is used with place adverbials like noɖa ‘far’ and buʈʰə‘near’. Generally, it is employed in short responses to a question. (3.121a) and
(3.121b) illustrate the use of {ʈʰi} with place adverbs.",[154]

"3.7.1.5 Spatial adverbs
When a speaker uses a spatial adverb to refer to an object which has an
attachment with a place, the adverb takes the morpheme {ɖə}. It can be illustrated
from the example (3.112).(3.112) luwa
thereɖəmi-paʈʰoLOC1POSS-arrowThere is my arrow.

"Nonetheless, the occurrence of (3.20) is more frequent than (3.21) in daily usage.
The morphological behaviour of pronominals of this language raises the question
of whether what I have called prefixation is truly affixation, or these reduced8485pronominals are in fact, clitics. Further investigation is required to determine the
precise nature of these reduced forms.
3.3.1.2 Demonstrative pronoun
In Jarawa, there are two kinds of demonstrative pronouns: one indicating
proximate object(s) while another denoting distant object(s). The proximate
demonstrative is li and the distal demonstrative is luwə. In this section, we
discuss the use of demonstratives as pronouns. These demonstratives are also
used as adjectives and adverbs (discussed in sections 3.3.5 and 3.3.6
respectively).
In (3.22), li is used as a third person pronominal where it refers to a person who
is climbing the tree. In fact, li is employed more frequently for third person
references than hi in subject position. luwə is used for distant object(s). Sometimes
it creates problems in interpreting the data because the same lexeme is also used
as adjective or adverb. Sentence (3.23) demonstrates the use of luwə as
demonstrative pronoun.

"85863.3.1.3 Interrogative pronoun
In Jarawa, there are two interrogative pronouns: onne ‘who’ and onəhə ‘what’.
Another question word onəhəle ‘what-VS’ seems to be derived from onəhə ‘what’. I
propose this due to the {-le} suffix, which is generally employed with nouns to
denominalise them (for detailed discussion, see § 3.9.2). Onəhəle may, here, mean
‘what are (you) doing?’ or ‘why are (you) doing?’ Other question words like
kahaje ‘where’, ʈʰučəgə ‘where’, nojčʰe ‘how many’ may have some differences
since these words are used with Interrogative Marker (INTM).
3.3.2Nouns and noun classificationNouns can be morphologically classified into two groups according to their
occurrence with possessive prefixes. Nouns which do not obligatorily take
possessive prefixes can be classified as free forms, and those which obligatorily
take possessive prefixes as bound forms. Nouns denoting body parts or kinship
terms exist as bound forms; the morphemes which stand for names of body parts
or kinship terms must be prefixed with a possessive pronoun. For instance, the
word ecepo ‘eye’ cannot occur in isolation — it must occur with a possessor, as in
wa-ecepo ‘his eye’, m-ecepo ‘my eye’, ŋ-ecepo ‘your eye’, ən-ecepo ‘eye {human
generic interpretation}’, and so on. Similarly, kinship terms also must occur with
possessive prefixes. There is, however, a slight difference between the usages of
possessive prefixes with these two types of bound forms. In the case of a body
part, the nominal component can take possessive prefix {ən-} which has generic
interpretation for humans but kinship terms never take this prefix. It may be
because body part nominal may be referred to in general, but in the case of a
kinship term it must be interpreted as belonging to a specific individual; it is
yours, his, or mine (for detailed discussion, see § 3.3.3.1).
8687Accordingly, my classification of Jarawa nouns is generally based on whether
they take affixes obligatorily. There are thus two kinds of nouns: one which take
affixes obligatorily (Class I) and the other which does not (Class II).
I also make an attempt to classify Jarawa nouns on a semantic basis. This gives
rise to three categories: celestial bodies, cultural artefacts, and flora and fauna.
a) Noun Class I
Noun Class I consists largely of nouns denoting body parts and kinship terms. In
section (i) below I focus on nouns related to body parts, and in section (ii) I
present a discussion of nouns related to kinship terms.
(i) Body part nouns
As mentioned earlier, nouns which are names of human body parts are bound
roots in Jarawa; otherwise they may occur as free roots. They can occur with the
generic human possessive prefix or the definite possessive prefix (for details, see
§ 3.3.3.1). There are two body part nouns čeŋ ‘blood’ and hʷetʰo ‘nerve’ which
occur as free roots. Also attested are compound nouns, like ən-iɲabotalaŋ ‘nostril’,
which is composed of two nouns, iɲɲabo ‘nose’ and talaŋ ‘hole’, and an obligatory
prefix {ən-}.

"But the use of ɖi in sentence (4.148) raises a question about the criteria employed
to consider an NP to be definite. In this sentence, ɖəwaɖəwa ‘biscuits’ is neither

4.10 Cleft sentences/relativisation
In this language, there is at present no clear cut evidence for relativisation. There
are, however, some constructions which suggest that relativisation may be192193employed in this language. These constructions are reminiscent of English cleft
constructions. The example (4.149) appears to be a simple interrogative clause
where there is an interrogative pronoun onne ‘who’ and a noun phrase əŋ
‘Jarawa’, connected with a copula ʈʰi. Literally it means ‘it is which Jarawa?’
(4.149)onneʈʰiəŋ?whoCOPJarawaWhich Jarawa is there? (Who is there?)
In (4.149) above, the interpretation of the clause is ’one of the Jarawas, but not
certain which’. This interpretation suggests two things: (1) this clause denotes
some indefinite entity, and (2) it seems that it may be similar to ‘it is which
Jarawa who is there?’ Moreover, this entire clause could be the S or A argument
of a clause. For instance, in (4.150) onne ʈʰi əŋ functions as the A argument of the
verb odehe ‘cut’. The structure of (4.150) can be represented as (4.151).

"In this group there is only one pair of sounds. In thispair we have palatal plosives. However, the corpus lacks minimal pairs to
5253confirm that they are phonemes. A lot of interchangeability has been
observed in this pair, but this is not true of all the words where one or the
other occurs. If we take pattern congruity as the principle to establish the
phonemic status of this pair of the sounds, we may claim that these sounds
are phonemes in this language.
/č/ vs. /ǰ/The phoneme /č/ is a voiceless unaspirated palatal plosive while /ǰ/ is a voiced,
unaspirated palatal plosive. Their existence as distinct phonemes has not been
established. The data so far demonstrates that they are in free variation in this
language, and no minimal pairs exist on record to claim that they are distinct
phonemes. We have seen above in the case of bilabial sounds /p/ and /b/ that
though they can sometimes be substituted for one another, they are still distinct
phonemes, since minimal pairs for them have been found. The same is the case
with the sounds /k/ and /g/. In the case of /č/ vs. /ǰ/, there are words like /čə:w/
‘wild potato’ which may be pronounced as /ǰə:w/. But also attested are words like
/čawa:ja/ ‘walk[v]’ which is never articulated as /ǰawa:ja/. There are, in fact, a lot of
words that begin with /č/ which cannot be replaced by /ǰ/. This creates the
suspicion that these sounds could be considered as distinct sounds in this
language. However, the question is still open as to whether /č/ and /ǰ/ are distinct
phonemes in this language or they are allophonic variants of the same phone.

bilabial, dental, palatal, and velar. Thus, we have four nasals in this language,
/m, n, ɲ, ŋ/. They seem to be in contrast with each other. However, the minimal
pairs for these nasals are not straightforward. Rather, I will demonstrate here
that contrasts exist between the following pairs: /m/ and /n/, /m/ and /ɲ/, /n/ and
/ɲ/, and /n/ and /ŋ/. However, minimal pairs have not been found for the pair /ɲ/
and /ŋ/.

fricative /ɸ/, though at present, evidence of minimal pairs which demonstrate its
5556existence as a separate phoneme has not been found. Similarly, the voiceless
palatal fricative /ʃ/ is found in this language, but as the corpus suggests, it seems
to be an allophone of the voiceless aspirated plosive /čʰ/; they exist in free
variation. Other kinds of fricatives are the voiceless pharyngeal fricative /h/ and
the labialized voiceless pharyngeal fricative /hʷ/. According to the corpus, it is
difficult to establish whether they are distinct phonemes or they stand in
allophonic distribution. In the present study, I have considered /ɸ/ and /h/ as
phonemes, and /ʃ/ and /hʷ/ as sounds, but further inquiry is required to ascertain
whether they are phonemes or are in allophonic distribution in this language.
/ɸ/
(2.69) /aɸle/‘fasten[V]’I was unable to find any alternate sounds for /ɸ/. Further, the Jarawa corpus does
not contain minimal pairs of /ɸ/ with other corresponding sounds to support a
claim that it is phonemic in the language. This sound can occur syllable-initially
and -finally, but its occurrences at word level are limited to initial and medial
positions. Thus, based on the corpus, it is difficult to claim whether it is a
phoneme or a sound in this language. Since there is no variability, the present
work assumes that it is a phoneme.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74]"
"40412.2.1.1Qualitative ContrastsQualitatively, vowels in Jarawa consist of high, mid, and low vowels in front,
central, and back positions with rounding and non-rounding features. This threeway combination of articulation yields seven vowels. These vowels are /i, e, u, o,
a, ə, ᵼ/. The phonemic status of /ᵼ/ has been established in this language but it is
still difficult to provide acoustic evidence to claim that the phoneme /ᵼ/ is a highmid central unrounded vowel. At the auditory level, this phoneme seems to be a
little bit higher than the mid central unrounded vowel /ə/ but lower than the
high central unrounded vowel /ᵼ/. Moreover, two mid-low vowels have been
encountered, but their phonemic status is not clear. Their occurrences are also
limited in the data and I do not have any minimal pairs at present. I will present
their distribution in phonological structure in section 2.1.2. Below I present some
minimal pairs and near-minimal pairs to establish the phonemic status of

there is evidence of some minimal pairs, which indicate there is quantitative
difference in this language. The data presented here covers both types of cases. I

The preceding chapter was a detailed study of Jarawa morphology. The present
chapter attempts to describe the syntactic structure of Jarawa: syntactic strategies
(how the language conveys commands, requests; the formation of questions, the
use of Reported Speech, and so on) and clause structure. The chapter will
elaborate these structures and their variances.
The chapter is organized in the following manner. In section 4.1, I present a brief
introduction to Jarawa clause structure. Section 4.2 discusses the verbless clause
in which a nominal or an adjective may play the role of a predicate. In section 4.3
is a detailed discussion of the verbal clause with core argument. Section 4.4
discusses verbal clauses with peripheral arguments. Section 4.5 focuses on the
negative construction, and section 4.6 describes imperative structures (includes
commands, requests, and prohibition). Section 4.7 concentrates on how
interrogative constructions are formed: it further focuses on yes/no and whquestion types. In section 4.8, complex sentences are discussed, and a close
examination of direct speech is presented. Section 4.9 attempts to depict the
function of definiteness/referential morpheme {ɖi} which seems to be used in the
ergative-absolutive system. Section 4.10 presents the conclusion of the chapter.
4.1 Clause Structure
Jarawa employs two types of clausal structures: verbless clauses where nominals
or adjectives function as head of the predicate; and verbal clauses where verbs
143144are the head of the predicate, with core arguments and/or peripheral arguments.
Both types of clauses have different morphological and syntactic structures.
Verbless clauses generally lack modality categories which are part of verbal
clauses.
Verbless clauses (nominal predicates and adjectival predicates) contain nouns or
adjectives as the head. Morphologically, adjectival predicates differ from
nominal predicates at least in terms of affixation, but cannot be classified as
verbal predicates for they combine with a marker {–g} which differentiates
adjectival predicates from nominal predicates. I have made an attempt to
investigate whether the morpheme {–g} is equivalent to the suffix {–g} which is
attached to verbal predicate. It has been observed that no other suffixes, which
can be attached to verbal predicates, can be attached to adjectival predicates. In
the case of nominal predicates there is no prefixation of S argument pronominals,
but in adjectival predicates such prefixation is possible in cases where adjectival
predicates begin with a vowel. Otherwise, adjectival predicates follow the
syntactic structure of nominal predicates.
The copula can be the head of a predicate; it takes modality suffix. Data in the
corpus, at this point, is limited to only one sentence. Thus it is difficult to
ascertain whether the copula should be considered as a predicate. Moreover, it
has another function in the syntactic structure of the language: it is sometimes
used with verbs used to indicate adverbial function (detailed discussion in § 3.8).
In this dissertation copula constructions are described under verbless clauses.
Clause structures are also defined in terms of the arguments. In verbal clauses,
the core arguments S (subject), A (agent), O (object) are defined in terms of the144145Subject of intransitive verb, Agent of transitive verb and Object of transitive verb
respectively.
4.2 Verbless clauses
The two types of verbless clauses — nominal predicates and adjectival predicates
— differ morphologically and syntactically. Nominal predicates do not bear any
morphological marking, whereas adjectival predicates can have morphological
marking.
4.2.1Nouns as head of verbless clauseWhile verbal predicates take modality and evidential categories as suffixes, and
adjectival predicates may also take a suffix (for detailed discussion see § 3.5 and
§ 4.2.2.3), nominal predicates never take such suffixes. Also, unlike verbal and
adjectival predicates, pronominals are not prefixed to S argument of nominal
predicates.
Nominal predicates have two different kinds of structures depending on whether
the S argument is a noun or a pronominal. If a pronominal is the S argument of
the nominal predicates, the clause is formed by juxtaposition, i.e. the pronominal
followed by the nominal predicate. If a noun is the S argument, the copula ʈʰi is
employed in the clause.
4.2.1.1 Pronominal as S argument of nominal predicate
Nominal predicates can have a pronominal as the S argument of the clause.
When a pronominal is the S argument of the clause, the pronominals preceding
the nominal predicates are juxtaposed. The structure of a verbless clause in the145146case of a pronominal being the S argument of a nominal predicate is given in
(4.1).
(4.1) [S]PRO[VL P]NPIt must be noted that the copula ʈʰi can never be used in such clauses.
Furthermore, the pronominal is never prefixed to the nominal predicate in such
constructions. For instance, in example (4.2), mi is the first person pronoun which
is the S argument of the nominal predicate əŋ, thus we have “mi əŋ” without
prefixing the pronoun to the predicate nominal. It seems that such distinction is
necessary to maintain since there is prefixation of the pronoun to the nouns in
possessive constructions (for detailed discussion see § 3.3.2.4).

This dissertation aims to present a descriptive grammar of the Jarawa language.
Sound system, morphology and syntax of the language have been examined and
analyzed to arrive at conclusion. This study also makes an attempt to classify the
language typologically. According to Radcliff-Brown (1948), the word ‘Jarawa’
has been derived from the Aka-Bea language of the Great Andamanese group,
which meant ‘stranger’ ‘or someone who should be afraid of’. The people who
speak Jarawa belong to a hunter-gatherer community living along the western
coast of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, a part of Union Territory of India. The
term ‘Jarawa’ is used for both the language and the people/community, although
Jarawas call themselves əŋ1.
The Andaman Islands have been the home for indigenous communities
comprising of Great Andamanese, Onge, Jarawa and Sentinelese (see §1.4 for
detailed discussion). All these communities represent ‘the first Palaeolithic
colonizers of South-East Asia’ (Thangaraj et al, 2003) and ‘remained in isolation
for a longer period than any known population of the world’ (Kashyap et al,
2004). The archaeological evidence for an early occupation of Andamans is scant
because of the nomadic lifestyle of the inhabitants and the limited number of
explorations that have taken place. At present, the oldest confirmed radio-carbon1Instead of using the term əŋ for this community, I will make use of the term ‘Jarawa’ throughoutthe dissertation, because this community and their language are known worldwide by this term
for centuries. Changing the term may create confusion among readers.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"(III)A complement clause will always describe a proposition; this can be a
fact, an activity, or a state (it may not be a place or a time).
(Dixon 2009:129)In Jarawa, clause internal clauses have the structure of a normal clause. They
denote a proposition. In the case of (4.107) it denotes an action. They also
demonstrate the syntactic properties of O (for detailed discussion see section 4.9),
it is, however, misleading to say that ujijə ɖ-ipale-jə functions as the O of bəᵼʈʰe,
since bəᵼʈʰe is an intransitive verb and it cannot take an O argument. I, still,
submit that such clauses are possibly made of two clauses: one is the main clause
and the other is the clause internal complement clause. This is based on the
180181assumption that these clause internal complement clauses are peripheral
arguments of the clause in case of (4.107). It is still an open question whether they
are complement clauses or not.
4.8.2.2 Complement external clauses
Another kind of complement clause is the clause external complement clause.
These types of clauses are not internal to the verb phrase of the main clause;
rather they exist as a different (dependent) clause. Direct and indirect speech is
considered as a clause external complement clause.
It is difficult to distinguish direct speech from indirect speech; for there is no
marking in both types. There are some instances where the difference between
direct and indirect speech seems to be employed, but the distinction between the
two could not be established. As the deictic center for pronouns in the utterances
indicates that such constructions are instances of direct speech, hence we
categorize these types of constructions as direct speech.
In such constructions, there are two clauses: one which is called reporting speech
consisting of reporting verb and another which is referred to reported speech. In
the present study reporting speech is referred to as main clause while reported
speech is referred to as dependent clause. In Jarawa the reported speech follows
the reporting verb but there is no particle or marker to distinguish the two
clauses: main clause and dependent clause. Thus, the direct speech in Jarawa has
the structure as given in (4.112).
(4.112) [Reporting Verb]MCL [Reported Speech]DCL181182The examples below illustrate the use of direct speech in declarative sentences,
interrogative sentences and imperative sentences.
a) Declarative sentences as reported speech
If the dependent clause is declarative, the syntactic structure remains the same.
The schema for this kind of construction is presented in (4.113) and illustrated in
(4.104-4.105).the examples that follow.

"5.4.13 Negation
Jarawa employs two strategies to express negation: either putting a negative
word at the end of a clause, or using a negative suffix to the verbs. Though the
negative word can be used in any type of clause, whether verbal or verbless, the
negative suffix is used only in verbal clauses. Examples in (5.33–5.38) illustrate213214the use of the negative word while example (5.39) demonstrates negation of the
verbal clause.

"4.6.2Prohibitive clausesProhibitives are a kind of command, order, or advice to not to do something. In
Jarawa, these are formed by putting the negative element naɖem after the verb,
like it happens in simple negative sentences.

In the comparative degree involving comparison of two nouns, the noun being
compared precedes, without any additional morpheme (it has zero case
marking). The standard of comparison follows, and appears with a morpheme
{wɛ} which is, in the present study, referred to as the comparative morpheme
(COMPM). This morpheme may also be referred to as a postposition, as it is used
after the standard of comparison, not with the adjective. In this work {wɛ} is
taken as a comparative morpheme because its use is limited to comparison in the126127present corpus, and there is no other comparison-denoting element in such
constructions.(3.102) ugəmomowɛʈʰiučəhəUgəMomoCOMPMCOPshortUgə is shorter than Momo.
The superlative degree is formed by combining the adjective with an adverb, or
by using a new word which is not morphologically similar to the positive form of
a descriptive adjective. In (3.103), there is an adverb ʈʰuhumə ‘very’ which is used
to indicate superlative degree.

positive form, ucəhə ‘short’.

1POSS-bowʈʰiʈomonoCOPshortestMy bow is the shortest one.
In comparative and superlative degrees, the copula ʈʰi is used before the adjective
as linking verb which links the noun with the adjective.","[144, 145]"
"5.5 Conclusion
This language is SOV but it deviates from the SOV patterns in many respects. A
tendency of SOV languages is to have postpositions, and this language also has a
postposition. Like some SOV languages Jarawa employs noun-adjective and
adjective-adverb patterns, but demonstratives, numerals and genitives precede
218219the nouns. In the comparative construction, the marker of comparison follows
the standard of comparison. Peripheral arguments/adpositional phrases precede
the verb. In complement clauses this language employs both the patterns,
complement clauses can occur before the verb or after the verb. The negative
particle or suffix appears at the end of clause.","[236, 237]"
"4.5 Negative clauses
Negation in Jarawa can be expressed in two ways: either by using the
independent negative word naɖem or the suffix –ma. Both are used for clausal
negation. There is no semantic difference between the two, but the suffix –ma has
restricted use in the language while naɖem can be used across the board.",[181]
"7273Chapter 3: Morphology3.0 Introduction
The preceding chapter was a detailed examination of phonetics and phonology
of Jarawa. This chapter focuses on Jarawa morphology with specific emphasis on
different word classes. Jarawa is an agglutinating language and has simple
morphology in terms of affixation, i.e. it takes prefixes and suffixes. There are
two kinds of prefixes: one is pronominal which attaches to verbs, adjectives, and
nouns; the other indicates definiteness or referentiality, and attaches only to
verbs. The principal functions of suffixes are (1) to convey plurality when
attached to nouns, and (2) to express mood, modality, and evidentiality when
attached to verbs. They can also, however, attach to adjectives, where they may
denote either state or evidentiality.
The chapter is organized in the following manner. In section 3.1, a brief
introduction to the concepts of morpheme and word in Jarawa is presented.
Section 3.2 focuses on word classes in Jarawa, and section 3.3 discusses noun
morphology. A detailed examination of Jarawa verb morphology is presented in
section 3.4 and of Jarawa adjectives in 3.5. Section, 3.6 presents adverbs, and
section 3.7 postpositions. Section 3.8 is a discussion of copula, and section 3.9
focuses on word formation. A brief conclusion is presented in 3.10.
3.1 Morpheme/word
The criterion that has been followed throughout the dissertation to identify a
morpheme is: a phonologically defined set of segments having a constant range
7374of meaning in the overall structure of the language is a morpheme. Phonetic
criteria of the production of a defined set of segments in one breath, or with a
pause, have also been taken into consideration, particularly to decide whether
two morphemes are articulated as a word or two different words.
In Jarawa, a morpheme may be a free root which exists independently, as in the
case of /napo/ ‘fish’. It may be a bound root which occurs with obligatory
prefixes (possessive prefixes in the case of a noun) as in ən-oɖə ‘hair’ (where {ən-}
is used as generic possessive marker for humans). Sometimes, a verb may be a
bound root such as ən-ətəhə ‘sit’ (imperative) for humans. In both cases whether
it is the nominal root oɖə ‘hair’ or verbal root ətəhə ‘sit’, they cannot occur
independently if they refer to human beings. The nominal root oɖə ‘hair’ can be
used for the hair of humans as well as non-human animals while verbal root
ətəhə ‘sit’ is only used for human beings. In the case of non-humans, the third
person genitive marker would be used with such a root. For example, if the hair
of a dog is to be referred to, wᵼmə wa-oɖə ‘dog 3POSS-hair’.
Thus, a bound root has to be prefixed with some morpheme(s). There are two
kinds of prefixes which co-occur with nominals: one is the definite genitive
marker (personal possessive pronoun), and the other the generic human
possessive pronoun {ən-}. The morpheme {ən-} is a more obvious choice for
prefixation in case of humans. It has two interpretations in this language; one is a
generic interpretation for humans, and the other, a second person pronominal.
There are other kinds of morphemes which can attach to roots/stems — whether
free or bound — as prefixes or suffixes; these can be classified as bound
morphemes. For instance, the word bəᵼʈʰe-jə ‘go-VEVD’ contains two morphemes;
7475one is bəᵼʈʰe ‘go’ and the other is {-jə} ‘VEVD’. Here bəᵼʈʰe ‘go’ is a free morpheme
and {-jə} ‘VEVD’ is a bound morpheme. A morpheme which occurs as a free root
or bound root, will, in the present study, be referred to as a lexical word, and a
morpheme which has to be attached to a root/stem as an affix, as a bound
morpheme.
3.2 Word classes
In order to identify word classes in Jarawa, it is necessary to go beyond notional
definitions that entail much overlapping. Therefore, a scrutiny of different words
is attempted through different diagnostic tests. Consequently, two more criteria,
morphological diagnosis, and syntactic distribution, have been employed to
identify different word classes in Jarawa. The morphological test is based on the
choice of the occurrences of prefixes and suffixes with the root form. Specifically,
the choice of a prefix or a suffix depends upon the lexical category of the root.
For instance, Tense Aspect and Mood (TAM) category only comes with a verbal
roots or a root used as the verbal predicate of a clause. In the syntactic
distribution test, the occurrences of lexical roots in certain syntactic
configurations have been evaluated. The distribution of lexical roots in a
clause/sentence depends upon the lexical category they belong to. For instance, a
lexical root may occur either as a subject, object, adjunct, or predicate, in a clause.
After scrutiny it was found that Jarawa has six kinds of word classes: noun, verb,
pronoun, adjective, adverb, and postposition. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs are open classes, where nouns and verbs are abundant while adjectives
and adverbs are fewer in number; postpositions and pronouns are closed classes
with a small number of lexemes. In (3.1) these classes are arranged in decreasing
order of the number of words in each class.
7576(3.1) noun > verb > adjective > adverb > pronoun > postposition
3.3 Noun Morphology: Nouns and Noun Phrases
This section focuses on nouns and pronouns, and their morphological behaviour
in the language. The section also discusses other categories that could be part of a
Noun Phrase (NP), and their behaviour within the phrases. An NP can have
noun or pronoun as head. Section 3.3.1 discusses pronouns and their different
forms, section 3.3.2 focuses on nouns and their forms, and section 3.3.3 deals
with the noun phrase and elements which could be part of the noun phrase.
3.3.1PronounsPronouns are heads of NPs. They have no lexical content, and either refers to
some nouns which may have occurred within the sentence, or draw reference
from context. These types of NPs occur at the place of noun-headed NPs to avoid
repetition. There are three kinds of pronouns: personal pronouns (pronominals),
demonstrative pronouns, and interrogative pronouns.
3.3.1.1 Personal pronouns
Jarawa uses personal pronouns to refer to humans and non-humans. It employs
mi as first person, ŋi as second person, and hi as third person pronoun. Second
person has, however, three variants {ŋi, ni, and ən} and third person has two
variants {hi and əhi}. {ən} has two functions in this language. First, it is used as
second person pronominal (generally as subject and possessive forms). Second, it
is used as a pronominal that has generic interpretation for humans. Jarawa
personal pronouns are summed up in table 3.1 below.","[90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"
"5657/čʰʰ/ vs. /ʃʃ/
/ʃ/ is a voiceless palatal fricative while /čʰ/ is a voiceless aspirated palatal plosive.
They are in free variation in this language; /ʃ/ can always substitute the sound
/čʰ/. The examples in (2.70) and (2.71) demonstrate their variation.(2.70) /ʃɛla/name of a woman(2.71) /čʰɛla/name of a womanHere the phoneme /čʰ/ and sound /ʃ/ seem to be in allophonic distribution as they
are in free variation. However, in one word /naʃa/ ‘penis’ in my corpus , it seems
that the phoneme /ʃ/ is not substituted by /čʰ/. /čʰ/ is, moreover, a phoneme, as is
evident from examples (2.43) and (2.44), but /ʃ/ does not seem to be. Hence, /ʃ/ is
considered to be in free variation with /čʰ/ in this language./h/ vs. /hʷ/
The phoneme /h/ is voiceless pharyngeal fricative and /hʷ/ is its labialised
counterpart.
(2.72) /huʈʰu/‘big/fat’(2.73) /hʷəwə/‘wild boar’Since they cannot be substituted for each other, I will consider them as
phonemes. /h/ appears syllable-initially and syllable-finally, while /hʷ/ can only
5758occur syllable-initially. There is no evidence to say that these two sounds can be
substituted. There is also no evidence as to whether these sounds can be replaced
by any other sounds in this language.
2.2.2.4Trill, Flap and LateralsAt the sound level, Jarawa exhibits one trill, one tap, and two lateral
approximants — an alveolar lateral and a retroflex lateral. Thus, the inventory is
/r, ɽ, l, ɭ/. It is evident from examples in (2.74– 2.77) that the sounds /r, ɽ, l/ are
phonemes in this language. The occurrence of sound /ɭ/ is limited in my corpus
and I do not have evidence to claim that the sound /ɭ/ is a phoneme, nor to claim
that it is a variant of another sound, particularly /l/.
/r/ vs. /ɽ/

(2.76) /hiɽu/‘black’(2.77) /hulu/‘hot’2.2.2.5ApproximantsJarawa has two approximants, bilabial /w/ and palatal /j/. The examples
presented in (2.78) and (2.79) are minimal pairs which demonstrate that they are
5859phonemes in this language. Moreover, we have not observed any variation
between this pair of sounds.
/w/ vs. /j/
(2.78) /wa:na/‘weep[V]’(2.79) /ja:nə/‘egg’2.3Phonemic distributionIn this section, I will discuss the distribution of sounds, examining which sounds
can occur syllable-initially, -medially, and -finally. I will also make observations
on the occurrence of sounds at the word level, that is, which sounds which can
occur word-initially, -medially, and -finally. In Jarawa, there are different
structures for the distribution of vocalic and consonantal sounds. Vowels always
form the nucleus of a syllable. Therefore, it is unnecessary to examine the
occurrences of a vowel in syllable-initial syllable-medial or syllable-final
positions. Hence, I have dealt with vocalic sounds only vis-à-vis words where
they can occur word-initially, -medially or -finally. For consonants, I have made
an attempt to examine whether they can appear as onset or coda in a syllable.
Moreover, I have also tried to see whether there is a possibility to consider their
occurrences at the word level. No consonant clusters have been found at syllable
level.
2.3.1At syllable levelSyllables in Jarawa consist of an optional onset and an optional coda. Data
suggests that Jarawa constitutes a syllable using one consonantal sound at onset5960and one at coda position. However, there are restrictions on the usage of sounds
at different levels. Hence, a word consisting of CVCV contains two syllables, CV
and CV. In the case of a word of CVCCV structure, I have considered this word
as consisting of two syllables, CVC and CV (for a detailed discussion of
syllabification, see section 2.5.
2.3.1.1ConsonantsMost of the consonants are found syllable-initially and -finally. The sounds /ʈʰ, č,
čʰ, ǰ, ɲ, r, hʷ/ are not found syllable-finally. Table 2.4 presents the occurrences of
consonants at syllable level. I have considered polysyllabic words to demonstrate
that these consonants can occur syllable-finally because there is no evidence for
the occurrence of these sounds in monosyllabic words. Wherever possible, I have
made an attempt to provide monosyllabic words.

word-finally.
2.3.2.1VowelsAt the word level there is ample evidence to claim that vowels can occur wordinitially, -medially or -finally. However, their distribution is not uniform across
these positions. Only short vowels can occur in all three positions, whereas long
vowels may occur only word-initially or-medially. I have presented the
occurrences of short and long vowel in table 2.4.

2.7MorphophonemicsIn this section I will discuss the phonological changes which occur in this
language. There are two kinds of phonological processes which will be discussed
here. Section 2.7.1 focuses on two forms of pronominals, which I have termed the
‘mi form’ and the ‘ma form’, conditioned according to how they are used. Section
2.7.2 presents a complex phenomenon which Jarawa exhibits, wherein two words
are taken together and the form of the second word is reduced. For example, mi
‘1GEN’ and paʈʰo ‘arrow’ are taken together and pronounced as /maʈʰo/ ‘my arrow’.
Here paʈʰo is only pronounced as /ʈʰo/. This phenomenon is very common in
Jarawa.
2.7.1mi vs. maThere are two forms of pronominals in each person in Jarawa. For the first person
there are /mi/ and /ma/, for second person /ŋi/ and /ŋa/ or /ni/ and /na/, and for
third person /hi/ and /hiwa/, though we have shorter forms for these pronominals
which are not taken into consideration in this section. These pronominals are
used in the positions of subject and object of a verb, and as possessive pronouns.
Throughout the dissertation I have taken /mi/, /ŋi/, and /hi/ form as ‘mi form’ and
/ma/, /ŋa/, and /hiwa/ or /wa/ as ‘ma form’. However, there is a great difference in
the usage of the mi form and the ma form in the syntax, especially in possessive6970constructions (for detailed discussion, see § 3.3.1). In the present chapter, I
enquire into whether there is any phonological reason to use mi vs. ma forms,
particularly in possessive constructions. In these constructions, for first and
second person any either form may be used, but only /wa/ is permitted for third
person. The examples in table 2.6 illustrate some of the patterns of usage of mi
and ma forms.

‘my friend’ŋi əččəle
‘your child’ŋ-itəǰile
‘your friend’wa əččəle
‘his/her child’wa-itəǰile
‘his/her friend’In the above data, there are three things that are evident. First, there is no change
in the possessive prefix of the third person; second, the mi form can attach to any
word, across the board; third, the ma form occurs with those words which have
back vowels in the first syllable of the word. The data also confirms that the ma
form is only used when there is affixation; i.e. attaching of the possessive prefix
to the possessed noun. If there is no affixation and rather, both the possessive
pronominal and the possessed noun are used as two independent words, the mi
form is generally used. Note that the environments showing vowel harmony
suggested that the process at work is, in fact, affixation.
2.7.2Reduced formsThere is a general tendency in Jarawa to reduce the form of a nominal or verb
when it is used in a possessive construction or in compound words. As
mentioned previously, /mi paʈʰo/ ‘my arrow’ can be articulated as /maʈʰo/. In
/maʈʰo/ there are two morphemes, mi ‘1GEN’ and paʈʰo ‘arrow’, where /paʈʰo/ is
reduced to /ʈʰo/ and combines with /ma/ to become /maʈʰo/. The general rule to
reduce the form is to take last syllable of the possessed noun and join it with the
5It is observed that there is no affixation of possessive prefix with əččəle ‘child’.","[74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]"
"In this group I describe those plosives and retroflexwhich have minimal pairs. Though there exists variation in the usage of the
sounds, I will attempt to discuss the variation, and thereafter based on the
methodological principles, decide the phonemic status of the sounds.
/p/ vs. /b/
The voiceless unaspirated bilabial plosive /p/ differs from the voiced unaspirated
bilabial plosive.
(2.29) /pe:l/‘shell fish’(2.30) /be:l/‘dewli fish’(2.31) /poɖ/‘honey found inside the tree’(2.32) /bod/‘make net basket’These minimal pairs demonstrate that the sounds /p/ and /b/ are phonemes in
this language. As said earlier, there are instances where these sounds seem to be
in free variation. Thus, the word /bəᵼʈʰe/ ‘go’ is also pronounced pəᵼʈʰe. Similarly,4748/piʈʰi/ ‘bad’ is, sometimes, articulated as biʈʰi. But instances of /b/ realised as /p/ in
words like bəᵼʈʰe are around 10–20%. Similarly, the instances of /p/ realised as /b/
in words like /piʈʰi/ are again around 10–20%. The frequencies of usage of /p/ or
/b/ in these words led me to consider /bəᵼʈʰe/ as the form for ‘go’. Similarly I have
taken /piʈʰi/, not /biʈʰi/ as a form for ‘bad’ used in this language. It is difficult to
ascertain whether it is a kind of a synchronic phenomenon or there is some
diachronic process that the language has undergone, since its closest sister, Onge,
still does not have the bilabial voiceless plosive (Abbi 2001, 2005; Sharma and
Dasgupta 1978).
/t/ vs. /d/
The voiceless unaspirated dental plosive /t/ contrasts with the voiced
unaspirated dental plosive /d/.

unaspirated velar plosive.
(2.45) /ukᵼ/‘bird’s wing’(2.46) /ugə/name of a personThis pair of sounds has some variations. For example, the word /kᵼyə/ ‘forest’ can
be articulated as /gᵼyə/. But such variation is limited to this word. We have a
word /gəgapa/ ‘talk’ which does not demonstrate any variation. Similarly there is
a word /kag/ ‘breast’ which does not show any variation. Hence, /k/ and /g/ are
considered phonemes in this language.","[65, 66, 67, 68]"
"The sentence (3.99) can also mean only the phrase ‘these arrows’. It is difficult to
syntactically assess whether (3.99) is a clause or a phrase. If this phrase is
employed as a subject or an object of a clause, then it can be interpreted as a
demonstrative adjective. For instance, in example (3.100), luwə paʈʰo-le ‘those
125126arrows’ is an example of a demonstrative adjective as this entire noun phrase is
used as an object of the clause.
(3.100)luwəpaʈʰo-leDEM-Aarrow-PLɖ-eŋge

3.5.3Degree of adjectivesJarawa differentiates between degrees of comparison. The language displays
positive, comparative, and superlative degrees. The degree of comparison is not
expressed morphologically. Rather, syntactic strategies are employed to express
degree of comparison. Positive degree is formed by using noun and adjective,
illustrated by (3.101).","[143, 144]"
"36372.1Sounds and PhonemesIn this section I discuss different techniques that were employed in establishing
whether a particular sound is a phoneme in this language. I also present the
methodological principles adopted.
The sound inventory of Jarawa contains 41 sounds, of which 28 are consonants
and 13 are vowels. However, it is difficult to claim that all the sounds are
phonemes in this language, for it is difficult to provide minimal pairs for every
pair of sounds in order to establish the phonemic status of a particular sound.
Even so, I have made an attempt to provide minimal pairs wherever the corpus
contains such data. The main problem in researching the sound system of Jarawa
is that we are not able to claim with authority that a particular sound is a
phoneme in this language, because the language demonstrates considerable
variation. Since there is a lot of variation at the level of sounds, it is pertinent to
discuss this aspect first. There are instances where two pairs of sounds, for
example /p/ and /b/ can be used interchangeably in the words like bəᵼʈʰe ‘go’. The
word bəᵼʈʰe can be pronounced as pəᵼʈʰe. Since we have minimal pairs which
demonstrate that these two sounds are phonemes in this language, we may
deduce that in such words they are in free variation. But in the case of palatal
plosives /č/ and /ǰ/ it becomes hard to decide whether they are phonemes or they
are allophones of the phone /č/ since we lack minimal pairs.
We can deduce from the preceding observation that whether a sound is a
phoneme or allophone is not always distinct. This difficulty arose during
research mainly due to lack of minimal pairs for each pair of sounds. Further,
those pairs of sounds which have minimal pairs also demonstrate some variation
3738in the words. In order to assert a conclusive result in such circumstances we
needed to enquire the phonological knowledge of speakers. Phonological
knowledge of speakers contains the phonological contrast which amounts to
minimal pairs. However, when a community is monolingual, it becomes difficult
to decipher every aspect of phonological contrast for each phoneme. In this
context it is important to state the methodological principles adopted to identify
phonemes. Four methodological principles were employed to state the phonemic
status of a sound in this language.
1. Phonological contrast: This highlights whether the particular sound is
contrastive in nature by looking at minimal pairs. There are some pairs of
sounds which have minimal pairs.
2. Variability among sounds: If there is no minimal pair for a pair of sounds,
an attempt was made to find out if there is any variability between the
sounds; and, if it exists, what the contexts of occurrences are for those
sounds in the language. If there is any variability and if it is difficult to
claim the phonemic status of the sounds, I have adopted pattern congruity
as the method to support the claim; for example in the case of the sounds
/č/ and /ǰ/.
3. Distribution of sounds: I have also made an attempt to investigate the
distribution of sounds at syllable level and word level. Examining the
occurrences of sounds at different levels assists in determining whether
the variability of the sounds is due to some kind of conditioning
(phonological or lexical) or it is an idiolectal variation.
4. Statistical criterion: Since some pairs of sounds show alternation among
themselves, it becomes difficult to infer which sound has the actual
representation in the words. To determine the actual representation of
3839sounds in words, I have adopted a statistical criterion where the
frequencies of occurrences of two sounds are evaluated.That is, if one
sound is used more frequently in a word than the other, the former is
considered to be the phoneme, and latter an idiolectal variation. This
criterion is employed if there is no viability of having definite sets of rules
which apply to a set of data to claim the allophonic status of certain
sounds.
2.2Phonemic ContrastsIn this section, I will attempt to provide minimal pairs to establish the phonemic
status of vocalic and consonantal sounds wherever it is possible.
Vowels in this language can be classed in three groups: two front vowels, two
back vowels and three central vowels. The front vowels are [i] and [e], back
vowels [u] and [o], while the central vowels are [ᵼ], [ə] and [a]. There are also two
mid-low vowels, [ɛ], and [ɔ], but their phonemic status is not clear. Their
occurrences in the data of our corpus are limited, and I could not obtain any
minimal pairs. Length is also phonemic in this language; hence we have short
and long vowels. However, no length distinction was found in the case of the
high-mid central unrounded vowel. Thus we have 13 vowels. Some nasalized
vowels were also found, but their phonemic status can not be established in the
present work.
Among the 28 consonants, there are voiced and voiceless plosives along with
voiceless aspirated plosives. Sounds like nasals, trill and retroflex flap, lateral
and retroflex lateral also occur in this language. There are two approximants,
labial and palatal. There are also a few fricatives like pharyngeal fricative, and
3940bilabial fricative. Two labialised consonants exist, pharyngeal fricative, and
voiceless aspirated velar plosive.

central, and back; and two way distinction in the position of lips: rounded and
unrounded. There is one vowel which may be categorized as a high-mid central
unrounded vowel [ᵼ]4. The minimal pairs and sub-minimal pairs are given in the

"219220Chapter 6: ConclusionThe Jarawas are a monolingual community living along the western coast of
Andaman Islands. The Jarawa people are primarily hunter-gatherers of Negrito
stock, with short stature, black skin, and frizzy hair. There is no evidence of
where they migrated from. Geneticists claim that these people were part of early
migrations of Palaeolithic colonisers of Southeast Asia (Thangaraj et al. 2003: 8693). Kasyap et al. (2004) commented that it appeared that the aboriginal
populations of Andaman Islands remained in isolation for a longer period than
any known ancient population of the world. The Jarawas came in contact with
the outside world at the end of 1998. After full contact was established at the end
of 1998, this is the first attempt to write a descriptive grammar of the language of
the Jarawas. For data elicitation, the method of participant observation was
adopted. During the initial phase, the pictorial method was also followed. In the
pictorial method, pictures of body parts, fish, animals, insects, etc. were shown to
the consultants to collect the data related to these pictures. Natural conversations
among participants were noted down. Since the community is monolingual,
learning the language of the participants was inevitable. The data collected in the
span of four years has been the only source for writing the present thesis.
Based on the initial description, the data was further investigated in order to
place Jarawa in the typological framework provided by Greenberg (1963) and
later supplemented by Hawkins (1984) and Dryer (2007).
In segmental phonology, the sound inventory, syllabic structure, and
phonological phenomena of the language were described. The discussion also
220221included problems associated with the identification and establishment of
sounds as phonemes. In order to establish the phonemic status of a particular
sound, four methodological principles were adopted. These principles were
phonological contrast, variability among sounds, distribution of sounds and
statistical criterion.
The sound inventory contains 41 sounds, out of which 28 are consonants and 13
are vowels. The vowel system was classified into two groups based on
qualitative contrasts and quantitative difference. In qualitative difference, threeway distinction in height, three-way distinction in tongue position, and two-way
distinction in the position of lips were found. One high-mid central unrounded
vowel /ᵼ/ was also attested. Length was found to be phonemic except for the
high-mid central unrounded vowel. In the consonant category, voiceless and
voiced plosives and voiced nasals were attested. These plosives and nasals were
classified based on five places of articulation, namely bilabial, dental, retroflex,
palatal, and velar. The aspirated counterparts of these plosives were also found
(except bilabial). In the consonantal group, trill, flap, lateral sounds were also
found. Two approximants, bilabial and palatal, were also attested. Bilabial
fricative and pharyngeal fricative were also found, though this study could not
establish bilabial fricative as a phoneme. Two labialised sounds, namely voiceless
aspirated velar plosive and voiceless pharyngeal fricative, were also found.
The thesis also investigates the distribution of sounds at syllable level and word
level. Most of the consonants are found both syllable-initially and -finally, but
the sounds /ʈʰ, č, čʰ, ǰ, ɲ, r, hʷ/ are not found syllable finally. Vowels were not
taken into consideration at syllable level because vowels form the nucleus of a
syllable whether it is initially or finally. At the word level short vowels were
221222found to occur at initial, medial and final position while long vowels were found
to occur only initially and medially.
Syllable structure was also investigated, and it was found that the syllable in
Jarawa has a nucleus with optional onset and optional coda; the language attests
all four variants of minimal possible syllable structures: V, CV, VC and CVC. It
was also found that the language allows only one consonant in onset position
and one consonant in coda position. Words in Jarawa were found to be
monosyllabic, disyllabic or polysyllabic.
In phonological processes, the use of mi forms and ma forms was discussed.
Jarawa demonstrates the use of reduced forms in possessive constructions which
are compound words consisting of a possessive prefix and an independent root.
The first syllable of the independent root gets truncated and the reduced form is
attached to the possessive prefix.
In the morphology it was found that this language is agglutinating in nature, and
employs simple morphology in terms of affixation. There were a few prefixes
and suffixes. In the prefix category, there were pronominals and the
referential/definiteness marker whereas in the suffix category, were mood,
modality or evidential marking with verbs, plural marking with nouns, and
state/evidential marking with adjectives. Six word classes were found: noun,
pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, and postposition.
Two kinds of roots were attested: free root and bound root. Three kinds of
prefixes were confirmed, which were possessive prefixes, pronominals, and the
referential/definiteness marker. In the suffix category negative suffix, evidential222223marker, mood/modality marking, state/evidential marking, plural marking,
denominalisation suffix were attested.
Two kinds of Noun Phrases (NPs) were found: nominal headed NPs and
pronominal headed NPs.
Pronominals are divided into three persons: first person, second person and third
person. Plural counterparts of these were not found. Morphologically,
pronominals were found to behave differently from nouns. Pronominals attach
to nouns as possessive prefixes, adjectives as subjects of complement clauses, and
to verbs as subjects of intransitive verbs or objects of transitive verbs. Two forms
of pronominals are also attested. These two forms were the “mi” form and the
“ma” form. Phonologically these forms demonstrated vowel harmony in the case
of the possessive prefix. When the possessive prefixes are used as independent
words, “mi” form is used. In syntax the “mi” form was found to be used as
subject whereas the “ma” form was used as object. Though the morphological
behaviour of pronominals indicated that they could possibly be considered as a
clitic, in this study this phenomenon is left for further research.
Two kinds of demonstrative pronouns, proximate li and distant luwə, are
attested. onne ‘who’, onəhə ‘what’, kahaje ‘where’, ʈʰučəgə ‘where’, nojčʰe ‘how
many/much’ were observed as interrogative pronouns.
Nouns were classified into Class I (bound roots) and Class II (free roots). Class II
were further classified semantically into celestial bodies, cultural artifacts, and
flora and fauna.","[237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"
"224225Two kinds of causative constructions, morphological and syntactic, were found.
Morphological causatives are formed by prefixing causative prefix {wa-} to verbs.
Limited data suggested that morphological causative is employed to a handful of
verbs, and the syntactic causative across the board. In syntactic causatives, the
independent word is used to express causation along with the lexical verb.
In the adjective category, this language was observed to demonstrate descriptive
adjectives, numerals, and demonstratives. Descriptive adjectives consist of words
related to colour terms or which define, describe, and qualify nouns. Also found
was marking of the degree of adjectives. In degrees of comparison positive,
comparative, and superlative degrees are attested. The positive degree is formed
by the noun phrase and adjective. The comparative degree was seen to be
expressed syntactically. In the comparative degree, the standard of comparison
was observed to precede the marker of comparison, and the adjective to follow
the marker of comparison. Superlative degree was seen as formed by employing
the intensifier or a completely new word which was not found to have any
resemblance with the adjective of positive degree.
Adverb was also found as a separate word class. These are lexical items used as
intensifiers, temporal adverbs, and spatial adverbs. No morphological
derivational process was confirmed to form adverbs from adjectives.
No syntactic case marking was observed in this language. However, two
morphemes were attested as postpositions to express semantic case. These
morphemes were {ɖə} and {ɲačʰe}. The morpheme {ɖə} has multiple functions in
this language. This morpheme was found to express place of location, source of
location, and goal of location. It was also frequently found with temporal and225226spatial adverbs, but not always. The morpheme {ɲačʰe} expresses the
commitative.
The morpheme {ʈʰi} was identified as copula. This copula is used to identify an
entity or qualify a noun. It was also seen employed with negative particles and
with temporal and spatial adverbs in short responses. Sometimes this morpheme
was also seen with verbs which were performing the function of adverbs. The
corpus suggested that this copula does not take inflection, but one example was
found where it was inflected for mood.
Four word formation processes were confirmed. These word formation processes
were compounding, denominalisation, reduplication, and the use of empty
morpheme. In compounding, three combinations were substantiated: nounnoun, noun-adjective, and noun-noun-adjective. In the denominalisation process,
we saw that nouns are denominalised to verbs with the help of a suffix. In
reduplication,Jarawademonstratessyllablereduplicationandwordreduplication. As for word reduplication, the corpus suggested that verbs were
reduplicated to serve the function of adverbial modifiers.
A notable phenomenon was also observed under word formation processes: a
morpheme used mostly with personal nouns (but also other nouns) was
discussed, but the meaning of this morpheme was not clear. Hence this
morpheme was referred to as an empty morpheme.
In syntax, the different syntactic structures of Jarawa, and their variances were
discussed. These syntactic structures included simple clause structures,
interrogative constructions, imperative sentences, negative constructions, and226227cleft constructions. It was also observed that this language follows the ergativeabsolutive system.
In declarative sentences, verbless and verbal clauses were discussed. Verbless
clauses consisted of non-verbal predicates like nouns and adjectives as the heads
of clauses. Copula constructions were also included in verbless clauses. Verbal
clauses contained verbs as heads of main clauses.
In verbless clauses we encountered two different types of clauses: one type had a
nominal as the head of the predicate, and another had an adjective as the head of
the clause. Verbless clauses also included copula constructions, since the use of
copula constructions were mostly observed in this type. In verbless clauses with
a nominal as head, two constructions were discussed: one where the S argument
was a pronominal headed NP and another where it was a lexically headed NP.
Lexical NPs were found to take copula constructions while pronominal headed
NPs never take copula constructions.
In verbless clauses with adjectival predicates, three kinds of constructions were
discussed. One was with prefixation of a pronominal S argument in adjectival
predicates beginning with a vowel, and which never takes a copula. The second
was copula constructions with a lexically headed NP as S argument which take a
copula. The third was adjectival predicates suffixed for state/evidentiality, which
also do not take the copula.
In verbal clauses there were four kinds of constructions discussed. These were
intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and constructions with denominalised verbs.
All these constructions were found to have different structures.","[242, 243, 244, 245]"
"3536CHAPTER 2: PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY2.0 Introduction
The preceding chapter was a detailed description of Andaman, its history and
culture, the Jarawa community, their history, culture, and society. The present
chapter discusses the phonetics and phonology of the language with focus on
segmental phonology and describes the vowel and consonant inventory.
Furthermore, I will make an attempt to enquire into the phonemic status of the
sounds3 present in Jarawa. This will be followed by a discussion of syllable
structure and other phonological phenomena in the language.
The chapter is organized in the following manner. Section 2.1 focuses on the
problems of sounds and phonemes in this language and the criteria that have
been employed to claim the phonemic status of a sound. It also talks about
phonemic contrasts of sounds, where I provide minimal pairs. I go on to describe
the phonemic distribution of sounds in syllables and words. Then I provide the
occurrences of sounds in different environments. In section 2.2 the syllable
structure of Jarawa is discussed. Section 2.3 describes syllabification, and section
2.4 deals with word structure. Section 2.5 focuses on the morphophonemics of
Jarawa phonology. A brief conclusion of the chapter is presented in section 2.6.","[53, 54]"
"34351.8 Organization of the present work
Chapter 2 describes the sound system of the language. This chapter begins with
the identification of sounds and their phonemic status in the language. To
establish the phonemic status of the sounds, minimal and sub-minimal pairs are
provided. Moreover, the distribution of sounds at syllable and word level is also
discussed. This chapter also investigates syllable structure and other
phonological processes found in this language.
Chapter 3 discusses the morphology of the language. This includes noun
morphology, verbal morphology, adjectives and adverbs. Copulas and
postpositions are also described. Noun morphology also deals with pronouns
and nouns, and their behaviour in the language. Verbal morphology consists of
suffixes and prefixes which are attached to the verbs, and their usage. There is
also a brief discussion on adjectives and adverbs in the same chapter.
Chapter 4 gives an account of the syntactic structure of the language. This
description includes verbless predicates and verbal predicates. This chapter also
focuses on negative constructions, interrogative clauses and imperative
structures. Complex constructions are also included in this chapter.
Chapter 5 concentrates on the typological features of the language. An attempt is
made to classify and categorize the language typologically.
Chapter 6 presents the conclusion of the thesis.","[52, 53]"
"In the case of possessive constructions, both the forms are possible. Within the
scope of this study, it can only be said that the distinction between “mi” and
“ma” forms seems to be phonological to some extent, though not always (for
detailed discussion, see § 2.5.1).
3.3.1.1.1 Morphological nature of personal pronouns
Pronominals in Jarawa can occur independently or can be attached to nouns,
verbs, adjectives or some other words. They can attach to a noun as a possessive
prefix; they can be prefixed to a verb either as an S(ubject) argument of an
intransitive verb or as an O(bject) argument of a transitive verb; and they can
also attach to predicative adjectives as their S argument.
It has been observed that these pronominals are prefixed to verbs, nouns, or
adjectives which begin with a vowel. In such cases the forms that are prefixed are
phonologically similar shortened forms of the independent forms. The
independent forms and their prefixed forms are given in table 3.3.",[98]
"Inthecaseofdefiniteness/referentiality this morpheme was usually employed with S or O. The
use of the morpheme with A was rare if S or O were found to be230231definite/referential. Thus, this morpheme conveyed grammatical relations in the
context of definiteness/referentiality. With an indefinite object this morpheme
was not employed with S, O, or A.
Typologically, this language was found to be SOV. Postpositions were found.
Descriptive adjectives and manner of adverbs follow the head while numerals
and demonstratives precede the head. In the comparative degree, the marker of
comparison follows the standard of comparison. The copula precedes non-verbal
predicates in copula constructions. Negative particles or suffixes appear at the
end of the clause.","[248, 249]"
"26271.6.2Rajasingh and Ranganathan (2000)Rajasingh and Ranganathan (2000) had a specific objective in working on Jarawa.
They collected data with the intention to prepare a primer for the administrative
staff and police force working in and around the Jarawa Reserve Area. They
collected words and sentences used by the Jarawas. Their work includes words
and sentences and their pronunciation alongside translation into English and
Hindi. In the introduction, a list of alphabets (symbols) is provided which are
used in determining the pronunciation of words and sentences of Jarawa. At the
phonetic level there are a lot of critical gaps in this list of alphabets. For example,
the sound [v] is not represented, but there are a large number of words in the
primer which employ the consonant [v]. Moreover, the list provided by the
authors contains a voiceless bilabial aspirated plosive [p ], but their data, rather
shows a voiceless bilabial fricative [φ]. Hence, the data fails to represent the
former, i.e., [p ].
1.6.3 Senkuttuvam (2000)
His work is an attempt to present the phonological sketch of Jarawa language
from his first-hand data (as he was the part of Expert Committee constituted by
the Government of India). He claims that Jarawa is closer to the Dravidian
language family but does not provide historical evidences such as cognates. The
work reveals many phonological misrepresentations. For instance, he tentatively
posits a back velar stop /q/ and glottal stop /Ɂ/ in the Jarawa inventory. Similarly,
he puts forward labio-dental fricatives /f/ and /v/, but the occurrence of /f/ is rare
in his data while /v/ shows up in many words. The bilabial approximate /w/ is
shown substitutable by /v/ in his description, for example /ya:w/ vs. /ya:v/ ‘tail’.","[44, 45]"
"Assertive Mood
{-jag}The assertive/emphatic marker {-jag} has two variant forms {-jag} and {-g}. The
conditioning environment for the occurrences of these two variants is
phonological. If a verb ends with the vowel /a/, the {-g} suffix will be attached to
it. {-jag} is used in all other cases. It generally indicates emphatic mood or shows
a strong assertion. For example, in sentences (3.73–3.75) it means that the speaker
emphasizes or asserts the action of giving and going.",[132]
"4.3 Verbal Clauses – I: Core arguments
Apart from verbless clauses, Jarawa has verbal clauses. In a verbal clause, a verb
is the central part of predication. These verbal predicates generally contain core
arguments of the clause, essential express the activity/event, and peripheral
arguments which provide additional information about the activity/event.
As discussed in the section 4.1 as core arguments, a verbal clause can have
subjects (generally referred to S and A) and objects (referred to O). These S, A,
and O are defined as: S, the subject of intransitive verbs; A, the subject of
transitive verbs; and O, the object of transitive verbs. This distinction is very
significant, as these categories have different roles in the grammar of a language.
The category O can further be split into DO and IO. DO is the direct object of the
clause, also called the patient of the clause, which has the direct effect of the152153action. IO does not bear the direct effect of the action; it could be benefactor, goal
etc. The general schema of a clause in Jarawa is given below.
(4.24) [Subject9]NP {[IO]NP [DO]NP} Verb]]VP
Other than core arguments, there are peripheral arguments. These peripheral
arguments provide additional information. They are optional in the clause. These
include temporal and spatial adverbs and/or nouns. The schema given in (4.25)
represents the structure of a clause in Jarawa with peripheral arguments.
(4.25)[Temporaladverb/Nouns]ADVP[Subject]NP{[SpatialAdverbs/Noun]NP} {[Object]NP} Verb]]VP
In addition to these broad categories are smaller categories like referential
marker (see § 4.9), locational marker (see § 3.7), and others. These categories
emerge in certain specific contexts in a clause.
4.3.1Intransitive clausesIn intransitive clauses, Jarawa employs S arguments of intransitive verbs as core
arguments, and intransitive verbs as the head of predication. There are some
denominalised verbs which function as intransitive verbs. We may put these
denominalised verbs in two categories, one in which they form part of weathertype constructions, and another in which they form part of transitive verbs
(semantically); however, syntactically, they behave as intransitive verbs of the
clause (for detailed discussion, see § 4.3.2). Generally, intransitive clauses in
Jarawa can be formed as given in (4.26).","[170, 171]"

"2728He describes five nasals as phonemes but in his description the dental, alveolar,
retroflex, palatal, and velar are shown to be occurring as homorganic nasals. He
also considers length as phonemic but his data-set lacks any of this evidence,
since /va:ya:/ vs. /va:ya/ ‘grandmother’, and /va:na:/ vs. /va:na/ ‘weep’ in his dataset, demonstrates that length is not phonemic in this language. Moreover, he
does not distinguish between the phonetic symbols for dental and retroflex
sounds in his work which creates further confusion.
1.6.4 Sreenathan (2001)
Sreenathan (2001) makes an attempt to present the psychological and cultural
state of the Jarawas through their language. He collected first- hand data to this
end (as he was the part of the Expert Committee constituted by the Government
of India), and presents, in this work, a phonological analysis of the language. His
attempt to relate language to the psychological state of the Jarawas is not my
concern here, but rather the fact that in the area of language analysis, he failed to
represent the sounds properly. There are many sounds represented by one and
the same symbolwhich creates confusion. For example, his phonetic chart
demonstrates that dental and retroflex stops are two different phonemes. But he
employs the symbols /t/ and /d/ for both types of stops. He also fails to note the
existence of voiceless aspirated plosive sounds, which are in abundance in
Jarawa.
1.6.5 Rajasingh (2002)
Rajasingh (2002) presents a brief description of the sound system of Jarawa based
on his earlier collaborative work (Rajasingh and Ranganath 2000). He provides
the placement of vowels and consonants on the phonetic chart, and a word as
2829evidence for each phoneme. A drawback of his work is that he does not use
different symbols for different types of sounds. For instance, he posits dental
stops and retroflex sounds, but uses the same symbol for both types of sounds.
Similarly, dental, alveolar, palatal, and velar nasals are represented by the same
IPA symbol. In his data, there are labio-dental fricatives /f/ and /v/, but he does
not place these sounds in the phonetic chart. Furthermore, what is described at
one place as bilabial fricative is transcribed as labio-dental fricative /f/ in another
place. Moreover, he does not clarify why he assumes that these sounds are
phonemes in this language at all.
1.6.6 Abbi (2006)
Abbi (2006) described the languages of Andaman with focus on Great
Andamanese, Onge and Jarawa; this work being a comparative study of the three
languages. This study is based on fieldwork conducted in 2001–2002. She also
provides supplementary data on Great Andamanese from her 2004–2008 project.
Based on the linguistic evidence she collected, Abbi is the first linguist who
proposed that Great Andamanese and Jarawa-Onge are two different language
families. She is also the first linguist to identify retroflex and voiceless aspirated
plosives in these languages, giving detailed phonetic charts and description of
phonotactic occurrences.
1.6.7 Blevins (2007)
Blevins (2007) made an attempt to relate Jarawa-Onge to Austronesian language
families. By employing comparative methods of historical linguistics, she
demonstrated that Jarawa and Onge are the two lost sisters of the Austronesian2930language family. Her analysis is based on earlier works on Onge and Jarawa,
including my field-data-set2 then available to her.
1.7The Present Study and its Methodology1.7.1 Present Study
As I have mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the present study was
undertaken to arrive at a descriptive grammar of Jarawa,. For this purpose,
Jarawa data was collected during fieldwork conducted during November 2003 to
July 2006. Based on the data elicited, an attempt has been made to present this
descriptive grammar and its position in the typology of languages.
1.7.2 Methodology
At the outset, I would like to admit that the data elcitation was not an easy task.
In my effort to collect data among the monolingual Jarawa community, I came
across three significant challenges: firstly, to accustom my ear to sound system of
the target language; secondly, to initiate data collection from the monolingual
community and thirdly, to learn the language. Each challenge had its own sets of
problems and required careful steps to move forward. Another substantial task
was to avoid cultural barriersbetween the researcher and the consultants, as we
did not know each other’s cultural and social norms. I did know that any minor
violation of their cultural and social norms might land me in a situation of
mistrust which might further lead to unacceptability within the community.
Even my research permit given by the administration contained restrictions and2I had been doctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig/Germany and she had been scientist there when the paper was written.","[45, 46, 47, 48]"
