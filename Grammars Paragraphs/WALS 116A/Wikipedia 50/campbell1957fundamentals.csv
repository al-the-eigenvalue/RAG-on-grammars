If you are not careful you can get very mixed up in these negative
questions and the unusual, though quite logical, reply, and it is better to try and
avoid them if possible.
The Thai themselves do not use the negative form of question very much in
conversation.
These short answers given to questions in Thai sound rather abrupt
when translated into English but they are perfectly alright in Thai and you need
not be afraid to use them.
Although we have tabulated the various forms of question and answer
above, there are no fixed rules as to when to use one or the other particular
form and in fact most of them are fairly interchangeable. Once you have had a
little practice in the language you will have no difficulty in forming an appropriate reply to any question.

As you will see if you examine these questions, it can be broadly said that if you
use REU it usually implies that you expect an affirmative answer.
Negative questions of the form of (b) above are not very common in
Thai and should be avoided for the present as the answer is rather tricky. See
Examples 8 and 12 Para 5 of this lesson.

There are many exceptions to the above general rules on question
words and in many cases alternative forms of question are equally acceptable
just as they are in English.

"15. A. 1. “Yes” and “No”.
There are no two words in Thai which can be considered as being the
equivalents of “Yes” and “No” in English and plain affirmative and negative
answers are given in a variety of ways depending on the way in which the
question is asked.
This fact usually causes difficulty to the foreigner who is accustomed to
using “Yes” and “No” quite freely in a large number of sentences where they
are in many cases fairly redundant and are merely added for emphasis or to
smooth out the sentence and make it sound less abrupt.
You have already seen some of the ways in which Thai people give
affirmative and negative answers and we will now bring all these and some
other forms together for comparison.
(a) In Lesson 1 you had CHY “it is” and MY CHY “it is not”, but
these two words are often used alone in sentences where in English we would also add “Yes” or “No”.

CONVERSATION2. A. 1. (a). Grammar Notes.
A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of
the verb or, in certain cases, after it. (See Lesson 7.)
When a negative word qualifies an adjective it is usually placed between
the noun and the adjective (Example 21.)
The future tense is indicated by putting the word JA “will”, “shall”
in front of the verb.
In most cases questions in the future tense can be answered in the
present tense.
The answer to a question is generally made as short as possible and in
many cases will consist only of a repetition of the verb in the case of an affirmative answer, or the verb preceded by a negative word in the case of a negative
answer.
The position of adverbs and adverbial clauses is variable. Generally the
adverb of time comes at the beginning of the sentence but we can add emphasis
to it by putting it at the end.
Other adverbs and adverbial clauses may go either at the beginning or end of
the sentence but the position of each particular one is usually fairly constant.
Adverbs or adverbial clauses seldom come in the middle of a sentence. For
instance;
“Go to the market and buy some eggs”
would be rendered in Thai as,
“Go buy some eggs at the market”
Interrogative adverbs and some adverbs of time such as “always”, “often”,
“soon” etc. are usually placed at the end of the sentence.","[30, 31]"
"REU ( 1 H 0 ) if it comes in the middle of a sentence usually means “or”.
You will meet it again as a question word in lesson 8.

CONVERSATION
8. A. 1. Question Words.
In Lesson 1. A. we saw that an interrogative sentence was formed by
adding the interrogative word MY or the words CHY MY at the end of the
sentence.
REU and REU PLOW are two other words which are used in a similar manner.
The distinction between the various forms of question is not easy to make and
in many cases they are used alternatively but we can set out the following broad
principles as a general guide.
MY is generally used for a direct question concerning something in
the present or future.
MY cannot be used in a negative question or in questions where the pronouns
14, 1414 or 11414 are written or implied.
In these cases we must use CHY MY (preferably) or else REU.

KA. There are actually two words (written KA in the transliteration) used
by women, and though there is little difference between them in normal
conversation it is appropriate to draw attention to them at this stage. *
KA ( f l £ ) pronounced in the high tone is normally used in questions
and requests.

KA (f)£) pronounced in the dropped tone is used with a reply to a question
or as an affirmative (See Lesson 15.)

"Note.
When referring to numbers of things or people a special form of construction is used
which includes a ""Classifier"" or Designatory Particle"".
For instance you cannot say "" H e has three houses"" but must say "" H e has houses
three buildings"".
The question of Classifiers and their usage will be dealt with in Lesson 1 0 and until
you reach there you had better be a little careful with numbers.",[46]

"Note.
That there are two different words (both written "" M Y ” in English) used in the
examples above.
I n the first and third examples MY is the question word and in Thai is written IklU
whereas in the second and fourth example it is the negative word "" n o ” , ""not” and in Thai
is written l uColloquially you will very often hear DY used in sentences where it would
strictly be more correct to use PEN.
There is also another word meaning “can” used in a rather special sense which
you will meet in Lesson 18.",[89]
"The Thai language is a “Tonal Language” which means that a word
may have two or more distinct and quite unrelated meanings depending on the
tone in which it is pronounced.
Altogether there are five tones but there is no single word which is
pronounced in all five although there are a number which may be pronounced
in two or three and carry a different meaning in each.
Most newcomers to the language are rather appalled at the apparent
difficulty of the tones but they are not as hard as is generally imagined even for
people with no musical ear.
A great many words in common use take only one tone and even where
a word has two or three tones, each with a different meaning, in most cases the
word you intend to use will be made clear by the context provided you get the
construction of the sentence right even though your tone may not be quite
correct.
The five tones are;
(i). The High Tone.
This, is a uniform tone pitched well above the level of the
speaker’s normal voice and is similar to the tone used in English to denote alarm.
e.g. “keep away”
It is indicated in the vocabularies by “h”

■fn
tan(ii). The Rising Tone.

REU ( M I S ) if it comes in the middle of a sentence usually means “or”
but if it comes at the end it is always a question word.
The expression REU MY (fl 3 0 111) at the end of a sentence, as you should
be able to see from the Thai spelling, is not a question word but means “or
not”, “whether or not”.
PLOW ( l l l d l ) “empty”, “no”. When meaning “no” it always comes at
the beginning of the sentence and is usually answering a question which
ended in REU PLOW (See Lesson 15. A.)

other words.
GERN PY (ifHlllJ) “too” is frequently met with in MAHK GERN PY
“too much” and in conversation this is often shortened to MAHK PY.
DERN (l£)U) alone means “to walk” but DERN LEN (walk play) means
to “go for a walk for pleasure”.
YAHK(0tHO) “wish” or “want” refers to the desire to do something and
is usually followed by J A “will” and then by a verb.

MEU-ANG (HJ01) means either “a city”, “a province” or sometimes “a

NAKORN (Ufl?) is another word for City.
MEU-ANG LOO-ANG is “The Capital City”, another word for which
is PRA NAKORN. The Municipality of Bangkok is also called PRA
NAKORN.
NUM KAANG (‘UHPU'l) Note the formation of the word “ice” from
NUM “water” and KAANG “hard”.
This type of composite word is quite common in Thai.
SY (lef) means “to put in” or “to add something to something else”.
There are several words in Thai which are translated as “put” in English but
they are all used in different senses.

ASYou may find it difficult at first to pronounce all the syllables of a
polysyllabic word in the correct tone but luckily there are very few words of
more than two syllables where the tonal values of the syllables vary, so that even
if the tone of one or more syllables is not quite correct the combination of
syllables alone will usually distinguish the word without ambiguity. The tone
of each word in the vocabularies is indicated as shown above and the same
system is used for all words in the extended vocabulary at the end of the book
but for clarity and simplicity of printing the tones are not shown in the romanized version of the examples throughout the text.
By far the best way to learn the tones at the beginning is the way a
Thai child does, i.e. by copying a natural Thai speaker, and as this book is
intended to be used with the help of a Thai teacher we recommend you just to
listen to your teacher and try to imitate the way he pronounces the words and
correlate this with the tone indications given in the vocabularies.
In Thai writing the tones are quite clearly indicated by the use of Tone
Marks coupled with a rather complicated set of rules but as the understanding
of these rules depends on a thorough knowledge of the Thai alphabet it is quite
meaningless to discuss them until you have first mastered the alphabet. The full
consideration of the tone rules has therefore been left until lessons 10 to 19.
1. A. 1. (b.) Grammar Notes.
The general arrangement of a simple Thai sentence is Subject-VerbObject as in English.
There are no Articles for use with nouns.
There is no inflection of nouns, pronouns or verbs ; case, gender, number, tense etc. being indicated where considered necessary by the addition of
other words.
Possession may be indicated by adding the word KORNG “of”
“belonging to” in front of the noun or pronoun but this is often omitted.
Plurality if not indicated by the text of the sentence may be indicated
by adding numeral words.
Inanimate objects have no gender and where it is necessary to indicate
gender in relation to animate objects this is usually done by the addition of
extra words.
Adjectives come after the noun they qualify.
— 3 —Affirmative and interrogative sentences are of the same form; the
interrogative sentence being indicated by the addition of an interrogative word,
usually at the end of the sentence.
The word MY expressed in a rising tone at the end of a sentence is probably
the most common interrogative word and denotes a question. Its use is analogous to that of the English word “NG?” as often used by Latin peoples at the
end of a sentence in English to donate a question.
“You will come tomorrow, No?”= Will you come tomorrow? When
an interrogative sentence contains words such as “who”, “why”, “when”,
“where” etc. no other interrogative word is needed.
In colloquial Thai and also to a lesser extent in writing it is customary
to leave out pronouns, prepositions and other words provided that the intention
of the sentence appears to be otherwise adequately expressed. On the other
hand words which have little or no meaning in the context in which they are
being used and are often quite incapable of translation are frequently inserted
in a sentence to make it sound more complete and euphonious.
Words which may be omitted are shown in brackets in the examples.","[17, 18, 19]"
