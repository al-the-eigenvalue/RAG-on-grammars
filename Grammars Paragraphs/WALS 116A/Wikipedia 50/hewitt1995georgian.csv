"568GEORGIANGRAMMAR5.1.13.3 'Alternative'
The second alternative, either a full clause or just the negative ara 'not',
is introduced by tu 'or'. The verb in the first clause has rising intonation,
whilst the second verb (or the negative ara) carries falling pitch, e.g.
bag-s
mo-(Ø-Ø-)rc'q'-av
tu
jroxa-s
garden-DAT PREV-(you-it-)water-TS(FuT)
or
cow-DAT
mo-(Ø-Ø-)c'vel-i
//... tu ara?
PREV-(you-it-)milk-TS(FuT)
or not
'will you water the garden or milk the cow // ... or not?'
5.1.13.4 'leading'
Questions expecting the answer 'yes' contain the particle xom with highfalling pitch on the verb, e.g.
xom
lamaz-i-a
sa+kart+v+el+o?
surely
beautiful-NOM-is
Georgia(NOM)
'Surely Georgia is beautiful/Georgia is beautiful, isn't it?'
leading questions expecting the answer 'no' have this same particle in
association with the appropriate negative, e.g.
si+m+suk+n+e xom a r
(Ø-)a-k'l-i-a-t?
fatness(NOM)
not
(3rd.PER-)lV-lack-PRES-it-Pl
'They don't lack fatness, do they/Surely they don't lack fatness?'
Alternatively, the addition of ara 'no' at the end of a simple statement
turns that statement into the equivalent leading-question. The final syllable
of this negative has high-rising pitch. So, the last two examples could
alternatively be expressed respectively as:
lamaz-i-a
sa+kart+v+el+o, ara?
si+m+suk+n+e ar (Ø-)a-k'l-i-a-t, ara?
5.1.13.5 'Surprise'
The surprise of the questioner at having to pose the question in the first
place is indicated by the inclusion of either gana or nu+tu, e.g.

5.22.3.1.6 Indirect Questions
As long as it is clear from the context to whom the question refers, one
always has the choice of repeating the original question with the
appropriate speech-particle. Yes/No-questions are treated like alternative
questions containing the words tu ara 'or not', and both end up with these
same words in the indirect question, which shews appropriate changes of
person and tense, e.g.

WH-questions continue to place the WH-word (or the phrase containing

especially where there is other material in the clause preceding the WHword, the indirect question may be introduced by the particle tu, e.g.

5.22.3.1.7 Fearing Clauses
There is a great variety of strategies available to convey a fear. Perhaps
the simplest way to express a positive fear is to use the appropriate tense
of the indicative, preferably accompanied by the speech-particle and also
by either vai-tu 'woe if' or xom ar 'surely not?', e.g.
m-e-šin-i-a,
vai-tu rus-eb-i
I-IOV-fear-PRES-it
Russian-Pl-NOM
šmo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an(=me+tk+i)

PRES
AOR
'I am afraid that the Russians will attack us // may be attacking us //
may have attacked us'which may be alternatively expressed by replacing vai-tu by xom ar
placed after the SUBJect rus-eb-i. These two variants, which are based
on direct quotation, sit happily alongside any tense in the introductory
verb, so that replacing m-e-šin-i-a above by the past m-e-šin-od-a
would give the equivalents of 'I was afraid the Russians would attack us //
were attacking us // had attacked us'.
An alternative is to turn the fearing clause into a negative wish (sc.
that something may not happen or may not be happening), which joins the
negative particle ar to the appropriate SUBJunctive (viz. Aorist for an
event in the future vs Prešent for one contemporaneous with the fear).
Such expressions may optionally be introduced by the complementiser rom
and optionally accompanied by the relevant speech-particle. The aboveexample in this variation would be:
m-e-šin-i-a,
(rom)
rus-eb-i

moment the fear itself is being expressed. In the case of a simple fear for
the future after a non-past main verb the Future Indicative, with or
without rom, is possible, e.g.
m-e-šin-i-a, (rom) rus-eb-i še-mo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an
'I am afraid the Russians will attack us'SYNTAX621cf. 2 Cor. 12.2Ø:

After a past tense introductory verb a fear relating to the future
relative to the expression of that fear may be expressed by ar 'not'
accompanying the Pluperfect Indicative without any speech-particle; the
complementiser rom is optional, e.g.

The above-examples of fearing clauses have exemplified howGEORGIAN
conveys a fear that something may happen / / may be happening // may
have happened. If the fear itself is that something may not happen // be
happening / / have happened, then the complementiser rom is preferably
retained with the negative ar and a non-SUBJunctive verb in the
appropriate tense (apart from the Pluperfect), e.g.","[637, 638, 639, 640]"
"NON-VERBALMORPHOLOGY813.5.4 Negative (uar+q'+op+it-i) Pronouns
Depending on whether one wants the neutral, potential or prohibitional
pronouns one has a respective choice of ara-vin, vera-vin, nura-vin
for 'no-one', or again for 'no longer anybody' the choice is a-gara-vin,
ve-gara-vin, nu-gara-vin; the declensions follow that of vin? above.
The parallel choices for 'nothing'/'no longer anything' are ara-per-i/agara-per-i, vera-per-i/ve-gara-per-i, nura-per-i/nu-gara-per-i
respectively; these decline like any syncopating consonant-final noun.
An older alternative to ara-per-i is ara-ra, or just ara. An example
of this last would be: ara-s (= ara-per-s (ar)) v-i-t'q'v-i 'I shall say
nothing'. The longer of the alternatives is today usually only found when
its constituent parts are split by the verb, as in the traditional start to
fairy-tales (viz. i-q'+o da ara i-q'+o ra 'there was and there was
nothing' = 'once upon a time'). For the potential equivalent vera in the
phrase vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you won't be able to achieve
anything' cf. mag kad+il-it vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i-t, bič'-eb-o
'with that impudence you won't manage to achieve anything, lads'.
3.5.5 Indefinite (gan+u+sa+zgv+r+el+ob+it-i) Pronouns
Indefinite pronouns exist with the suffixes - m e for non-specific
indefiniteness and -ga+c for specific indefiniteness; they are based on the
human and non-human interrogative pronouns. The basic (and easiest)
declension-pattern fuses the particle to the root and then adds the casedesinence, but alternatives are available. We start with vin-me 'anyone':

3.5.6 Relative (mi+mart+eb+it-i) Pronouns
The relative pronouns are produced by suffixing -c to the appropriate
interrogative pronoun with the relevant case-endings. The relative
pronouns are: v i n - c 'who', r a - c 'which', r o m e l - i - c 'who, which',
ra+m+den-i-c 'as many as', ro+gor-i-c/ra+nair-i-c/ra+gvar-i-c 'of
which type'. Any clitic postposition will precede the suffix (e.g. v - i s tvisa-c 'for whom'); when the postposition is -ze, it may expand to -zeda
(e.g. romel-ze(da)-c 'on which'); when it is -ši, it may expand to -ái(d)a
(e.g. ra-ái((d)a)-c 'in which'). When the relative pronoun is accompanied84GEORGI AN GRAMMARby a free-standing postposition or, if Genitive, by a head-noun, the suffix
will either attach to the final word of the phrase in which the relative
pronoun stands or will be absent, e.g.
k'ac-eb-i,
roml-eb-is col-eb-i(-c)

The noun tav-i 'head' serves as reflexive pronoun. It is either used by
itself, e.g.

or in association with the appropriate possessive adjective, e.g.

3.5.8 Emphatic (xaz+ga+sm+it-i) Pronouns
The indeclinable emphatic pronoun is t(v)+it+on 'self'; variants are the
shorter tv+it (in origin a syncopated variant of the Instrumental of tav-i
'head; self) or tav+ad (the Adverbial of tav-i 'head; self). Standing quite
alone the emphatic pronoun may function as either aNOMINATIVEor
Ergative case; otherwise it stands alongside the case-form of the word it
emphasises (e.g. t(v)+it+on/tv+it/tav+ad c'a-vid-a 'X(NOm) went
himself/X went herself/X went itself; t(v)+it+on/tv+it/tav+ad m o (Ø-)k'l-a i+s kal-i 'X(ERG) killed that woman himself/X killed that woman

3.5.9 Reciprocal (urt+i+ert+ob+it-i) Pronouns
The two pronouns are ert+man+et-i and ert+i+me+or+e 'each other,
one another'. Although the analysis of both is transparent, the first
containing the cardinal '1' in the Ergative case (= -man-) followed by an
abbreviated form of itself, the second containing theNOMINATIVEform of
the same cardinal followed by the ordinal '2nd', the pronouns behave like
unanalysable wholes and serve as objects, changing for case accordingly
like normal consonant-final and vowel-final nouns respectively, e.g.

3.5.10 Possessive (k'utvn+il+eb+it-i) Pronouns
Essentially there is a unified pattern that is followed in the formation of
every type of possessive pronoun: take the Genitive of the relevant
pronoun, treat this as the stem for the possessive, and simply add the
appropriate case-ending to this new stem to suit the context—in the
NOMINATIVE such forms are ambiguous, being either the possessive pronoun
or the equivalent possessive adjective. The Dative, however, usually ends
in -a-s (often used in the sense of 'at so-&-so's place'). According to
Tschenkéli, there is no Genitive case, but I give what would surely be such
a Genitive below in the conviction that, if one needed to make one of these
pronouns the object of the Genitive-taking verb 'fear', one could have
recourse to just such forms. Let us take as the starting illustration the
reflexive possessive tav-is-i 'one's own' vs tav+ian-t-i 'their own'—N.B.

3.6. Particles'each(na+c'il+ak'-eb-i)3.6.1 Interrogative Particles
Though OldGEORGIANformed 'Yes-No' questions by means of the clitic
particles -a and -me, the modern literary language does not (cf. 5.1.13.1),
though some mountain-dialects still employ -a.
Leading questions expecting the answer 'yes' contain xom, those
expecting the answer 'no' contain xom ar/ver (cf. 5.1.13.4).
An element of surprise is introduced into a question by means of either
of the particles gana or nu+tu (cf. 5.1.13.5).
We have seen the particle -ga used with interrogative pronouns to
lend them the nuance of 'pray, on earth' (cf. 3.5.3). Less restrictedly such a
nuance can be provided by such particles as gana,
nu+tu,
vi+to+m/mitam, net'a(v(i)), e.g.
gana ra

net'a vin i-q'+o i+s gogo?
'Who pray was that girl?'
For the conjunctional role of vi+to+m see 5.2.2.3.2.
3.6.2 Conjoining Particles
The clitic particle -c(a) 'too, also' is used; when attached to a word ending
in a consonant, it must be preceded by the vowel -a-, e.g.
mankana-c
ga-v-(Ø-)t'ex-e
car(NOM)-too PREV-I -(it-)smash-AOR
'I smashed the car too'89NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYWhen used in the way just illustrated, it can be substituted by
a+g+re+t+ve 'also' (e.g. a+g+re+t+ve mankana ga-v-(Ø-)t'ex-e). In a
series of conjuncts, the clitic may be attached to each (functioning as
equivalent to 'both...and') and accompanied by the conjunction da 'and', e.g.
p'arask'ev-sa-c tov-d-a
da k'vira-sa-c
Friday-DAT-too
snow-I mPERF-it and Sunday-DAT-too
'it snowed on both Friday and Sunday'
The sequence -c k'i is the equivalent of 'even', e.g.

3.6.3 Indefinite Particles
The use of the non-specific -me and the specific indefinite -ga+c in the
formation of indefinite pronouns was described in 3.5.5.
3.6.4 Speech Particles
The analysis and function of the three particles -me+tk+i, -tko/-tkv-a,
-o are presented in 5.2.2.3.1.2.
3.6.5 Response Particles
Affirmative replies are indicated by diax, k'i, ho 'yes' (most formal,
neutral, least formal respectively). Negative responses are shewn by ara
'no' or vera 'no (Potential)'.
3.6.6 Relative Particle
-c(a) added to interrogative adjectives, pronouns and
produces the equivalent relative forms, as described earlier.adverbs90GEORGI AN GRAMMAR3.6.7 Emphatic Particles
We have already met -ve combined with some demonstratives. Attached
to the numeral '2' it gives or-i-ve 'both'. In association with other
numerals it means 'all NUmERAL' (e.g. otx-i-ve (ǰar+is+k'ac-i) 'all 4
(soldiers)'). In general its attachment adds the nuance of 'the very same,
just, precisely', e.g.

'So what is interfering with you? (sc. nothing is)'
ak'i is something akin to English 'look' (e.g. ak'i (Ø-)g-i-txar-i! 'look,
I have told you!').
Suffixed to the conditional conjunction tu the particle k'i gives us the
form tu-k'i meaning 'if indeed'.
The element tu, possibly functioning alone as a sort of abbreviated
condition, can add the sense of 'if at all' to an expression, e.g.
bodiš-i
jnel-ad
tu mo-(0-)a-rč-en-s
apology-NOM difficult-ADV if
PREV-(it-)NV-heal-TS-it(FUT)
mo+grex+il k'iser-s

neck-DAT
'an apology will only with difficulty (sc. if at all) heal a twisted neck (sc.
one who is destroyed/defeated)'
tu is also found in the negative phrases ara tu, which is synonymous
with ara mxolo+d 'not only' (cf. 5.2.1), and tu ara da, which is
synonymous with both t o r e m 'otherwise' and the full expression
c'ina+ag+m+deg še+mtxv+ev+a-ši 'in the opposite circumstance', e.g.

otherwise
PREV-I-die-TSFUT.INDIC
'I shall come (back) alive, otherwise I shall die'
We have met -ga in the sense of 'pray'. It can also mean 'only', in
which role it equals mxolo+d (e.g. gušin-c'in-ga (= mxolo+d gušinc'in) mo-k'vd-a 'X died only the day before yesterday').
dae/de(e) (which derives from the imperative d a - ( 0 - 0 - ) e - x s e n
'leave off it/let it be!') is used to strengthen commands, e.g.
dae,
letga+bat'on+eb+ul-i k'las-eb-i

5.1.13 Questions
5.1.13.1 Yes-No'
Questions of this type involve no movement of words but are signalled
entirely by the application of the appropriate intonation-pattern, namely a
rišfalling pitch on the final syllable of the verb, which will normally be
the last word in the šentence.
5.1.13.2'Content'
The appropriate interrogative pronoun, adjective or adverb is selected.
The phrase containing this interrogative word is placed immediately before
the verb (or, if prešent, the negative adverb). The intonation is a falling
pitch on the verb's stressed syllable, e.g.","[583, 584]"
"282.3GEORGI AN GRAMMARRoot-structureTypical roots consist of a single consonant or consonant-cluster (e.g. - k ­
in k-eb-a 'praise/praising', -k'vd- in k'vd-om-a 'dying' or si-k'vd-il-i
'death'), consonant(-cluster) plus vowel (e.g. ru 'stream', gru 'hole'), vowel
plus consonant(-cluster) (e.g. av-i 'evil, bad, poorly', ert-i T), consonant(cluster) plus vowel plus consonant(-cluster) (e.g. mal-av 'you hide X/them',
q'lap'-av 'you swallow X/them', k'arg-av 'you lose X/them', xvanǰ-av =
xlart-av 'you entangle/entwine X/them'). Polysyllabic roots also occur
(e.g. k'ata 'cat', iol-i 'easy', a-k'varaxč'in-eb 'you cunningly manage
X/them'), reduplication often (though not exclusively) occurring with words
depicting sounds (e.g. xar=xar-i 'belly-laughter', xit=xit-i 'giggle',
but'=but'-eb 'you mumble', lug=lug-eb 'you slur your speech')
reduplications often alter the second component slightly (e.g. abda=ubda
'nonsense', ogro=čogro 'bumpy', gac'a=mac'ia-ši v-a+r 'I am run off my
feet (= in a state of having much to do at once)'). Other than in derived
forms, it is very rare for a verbal root either to begin or end in a vowel; a
handful of verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb do, however, end in -i (e.g. moi-xs(+)eni-eb 'you will mention X/them', mo-i-ger(i)-eb 'you will ward
off X/them', mo-i-šveli-eb 'you will use X/them as an aid', mo-i-nani-eb
'you will repent X/them'2).
2.4Suprasegmentals2.4.1 Stress
Stress is weak and, possibly for this reason, its placement has proved
somewhat difficult to specify. Writing in 1904 Adolf Dirr gave the
following description: 'Der Akzent ist im Georgischen ein Längenakzent; die
Stimme steigt nicht wie im Deutschen oder Russischen... Die Betonung fällt:
1. in zwei- und dreisilbigen Wörtern auf die erste Silbe; 2. in mehrsilbigen
auf die drittletzte. Diese Regeln bleiben auch dann giltig, wenn das Wort
durch Deklination oder Konjugation verlängert wird. Zusammengesetzte
Wörter haben den Hauptton auf dem ersten Element, das zweite bekommt
einen Nebenton. Uebrigens wird der Akzent schwächer markiert als im
Deutschen und die gewöhnliche Konversationssprache geht oft über die
Akzentregeln hinweg' (pp.3-4). Tschenkéli (1958.LX) says: 'a. In Wörtern
mit zwei oder drei Silben wird die erste Silbe betont...; b. Für Wörter mit
mehr als drei Silben ist es kaum möglich, feste Regeln aufzustellen. Es lässt
sich nur im allgemeinen sagen, dass in vier- und mehrsilbigen Wörtern
gewöhnlich die erste Silbe betont wird, nie dagegen die letzte. Die29SOUND SYSTEMdrittletzte Silbe bekommt oft den Nebenton...; c. Besonders in
zusammengesetzten Wörtern trägt der erste Teil den Ton. Wenn
gelegentlich auch der zweite Teil betont wird, so geschieht dies sekundär.
Der Hauptton liegt, besonders wenn es sich um Präfixe handelt, immer auf
dem ersten Teil, d.h. auf dem Präfix'.
Even in tri-syllabic surnames ending in -Je 'son' (older 'heir') stress falls
on the penultimate syllable (e.g. ševardnáje), just as it tends to fall on the
same penultimate for surnames ending in the other common formant—
šv+il-i 'child' (e.g. kartvelišvlli), though for tri-syllabics in general it is
true that the ante-penultimate syllable takes the stress. For words of more
than three syllables, we can say that the stress will predominantly fall on
the ante-penultimate (e.g. me-or-m-oc-da-t-ékvs-met'-e '56th'), though
in some cases preference will be for the first syllable to carry it (e.g.
mêgobar-i 'friend').
Since the stressed syllable is so relatively weakly distinguished from
other syllables in the word, there is nothing like the vowel-weakening in
unstressed syllables that is so characteristic of languages like Russian,
though perhaps the origin of syncope is to be sought in an older stage of
the language where stress might have been more prominent.
2.4.2 Pitch
Questions containing a question-word place a high-fall on the verb's
stressed syllable, e.g.
a+s + e adre ra+t'om mV(Ø 3 -)di-x-a+r
so
early why
PREV-(you-)go-you-be(PRES)
'Why are you going to town so early?'
e+s
vin
ga-(Ø-)à-k'et-a?
this(NOM) who(ERG) PREV-(it-)NV-do-X(AOR)
'Who did this?'kalak-ši?
town-toIf the answer is not heard and the essential components of the question
are repeated, the question-word has a high-fall, whilst the final syllable of
the accompanying verb carries a rise (ràt'om mi-(Ø-)di-x-á+r? 'Why are
you going (sc. did you say)?', vin ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-á? 'Who did it (sc. did you
say)'). If an interruption is made using an interrogative only, then that
interrogative carries high-falling pitch (A: london-ši mi-v-di-v-a+r. B:
sàd(a)? 'A: I am going to London. B: Where?'). Yes-no questions take a
rise-fall on the final syllable of the verb, which will regularly be the final
word of the sentence—the presence of this pitch causes a concomitant30GEORGI AN GRAMMARlengthening of the vowel on which it falls (e.g. mi-(0-)di-x-a+r? =
[midixáàr] 'Are you going?'). Tag-questions are characterised by a highfalling pitch on the verb's stressed syllable (e.g. xom mV(0-)di-x-a+r?
'You are going, aren't you?', xom ar rni-(0-)di-x-a+r? 'You aren't going,
are you?'). Alternative questions have high-falling pitch on the negative
element in the second part of the question (e.g. mi-(0-)di-x-a+r tu ara?
= mi-(0-)di-x-a+r tu àr mi-(0-)di-x-a+r? 'Are you going or not
(going)?').
2.5 Sound-symbolism
Holisky (1981.122-125) and at greater length Holisky and Kaxadze
(1986.184-207) draw attention to some verb-sets indicating the production
of types of sound where a particular nuance is introduced either by
retaining the place of articulation of a consonant(-cluster) whilst altering
the manner of articulation or by alteration to the vowels within the root.
Examples:
i. The set depicts loud, irritating crying of children, ugly and openmouthed:
ǰgav-i-s indicates the loudest, lowest (not piercing) sound-production
vsčxav-i-s which stands between the former and the following, being
piercing and coarser than the following vs
č'q'av-1-s which is highest, piercing and sharp
ii. The two depict quiet, indistinct grumbling in an irritated, unhappy tone
of voice, usually implying discontent:
burdgun-eb-s is the lower, more prolonged, continuous sound vs
burt'q'un-eb-s which is higher with less talking, perhaps more sudden,
as when blurting something out
iii. The two depict sobbing, usually of children or very young teenagers:
zlukun-eb-s is the lower, louder, stronger, more involved vs
sluk'un-eb-s which is higher and softer
For the effect stemming from a change of vowel we take:

5.1.13.6 Questions with raising
Questions of the type 'Who do you think will gain the victory?', which
involve the question-word being raised out of its own clause, are formed in
GEORGIANby asking two separate questions—the first takes the form 'How
do you think?', whilst the second asks the basic question with the questionword remaining in its own clause, producing for this particular example:
ro+gor (Ø-?Ø-)pikr-ob?
vin
how
(you-?3rd.PER-)think-TS(PRES) who(NOM)
ga-(?Ø-)i-marjv-eb-s?
PREV-(?3rd.PER-)SV-be.victorious-TS(FuT)-X
5.1.14 Negation
5.1.14.1 Prohibition
The negative particle reserved for making prohibitions is nu. It is used
with the Prešent Indicative (if the aspect is progressive) or with the Future
Indicative (if the aspect is momentary) for all three persons, e.g.
maga-s
nu
that(2nd.DEIXIS)-DAT not
'Don't do that!'
nu gv-e-äin-i-al
not we-IOV-fear-PRES-?it
'let us not be afraid!'ga-(Ø-Ø-)a-k'et-eb!
PREV-(you-it-)NV-do-TS(FuT)However, an alternative, more polite method of expressing negative
imperatives is to combine the adverb ar 'not' with the subjunctive mood57ØGEORGIANGRAMMAR(usually the Aorist), e.g.
eg
at-i
k'ap'ek'-i
ar ča-(Ø-Ø-)a-gd-o-t!
that(2nd.DEIXIS) 1Ø-AGR kopeck-NOM not PREV-(you-it-)NV-throwAOR.SuBJ-Pl
'Don't (please) drop that 1Ø kopeck-piece in (sc. the honesty-box)!'
Though the prescriptive division between 'nu + Indicative' and 'ar +
Subjunctive' is clear, the mixed construction 'nu + Subjunctive' is also
found, e.g.
gul-ma
nu
(?Ø-)i-xar-o-s
heart-ERG not(PROH) (?it-)SV-rejoice-AOR.SuBJ-it
'let the heart not rejoice!'
Indeed, there is an old formula where this coupling seems to be the
norm, viz.
gmert-ma tkven-i
tav-i
God-ERG
your-AGR head-NOMnu
notmo-(Ø-)gv-i-šal-o-s!
PREV-(it-)us-OV-depriveAOR.SuBJ-he'May God not deprive us of you!'
Note also examples of (i) nu + Perfect, e.g.
ga-(Ø-)čum-d-i
PREV-(you-)quiet-PASS-AOR.INDIC(= IMPER)
c'a-g-i-t'lek'-i-a

'Shut up—don't start prattling on!'ert-i

notand (ii) nu + IIIrd Subjunctive, as exemplified in 5.1.16.
5.1.14.2 Potential
Where negation is combined with the notion of ability (viz. 'cannot/could
not'), one can avoid using the unmarked negative adverb ar in association
with the lexical verb meaning 'X is possible for Y' by employing the special
potential negative form ver with an indicative of the very verb whose
action is stated to be impossible, e.g.","[587, 588, 589]"

'He would not (have) come out, until he (had) finished his domestic
duties'
Alongside a negated Aorist in the main clause a negated Aorist is
preferred in the subordinate clause, e.g.
ar ga-mo-vid-a,
sa+na+m sa+šina+o
not PREV-PREV-come.out-he(AOR)

da+val+eb+a
ar da-(Ø-)a-m+tav+r-a
obligation(NOM)
not PREY-(it-)NV-finish-he(AOR)
'He did not come out until he had finished his domestic duties'
Where the negated Perfect is required in the main clause, the negated
Perfect will stand alongside it in the dependent clause, as in the following
adaptation of the last example:
ar ga-mo-s-ul-a, sa+na+m sa+šina+o da+val+eb+a ar
da-(Ø-)u-m+tav+r-eb-i-a
'He apparently did not come out until he had finished his domestic
duties'
If these two clauses were together made dependent upon a past tense
introductory verb of command, such that the resulting structure
reprešented indirect speech, the temporal clause would have to contain the

522.1.7.4.3 'before'
Where the temporal šense is indisputably 'before' (i.e. when the main verb
is positive and of non-durative aspect), a non-past verb in the main clause
is accompanied by the Future SUBJunctive in the subordinate clause (though
the Future Indicative is also feasible when reference is to a specific
event), whilst a past tense main verb is partnered by the Conditional in the
dependent clause (though the Aorist Indicative is possible when there is no
long gap between the main and subordinate events), e.g.

where the negated Aorist SUBJunctive of the subordinate clause is
preferably substituted by the negated Future Indicative (viz. k'ac-i gul-s
ar da-(Ø-)i-jer-eb-s).
As far as non-finite reprešentations are concerned, again the notions
'until' and 'before' merge in the use of the postposition -mde (older -mdis)
governing the Adverbial case of the Masdar, e.g.

5.2.2.1.7.4 Surrogate for the participle as claušsubstitute
None ofGEORGIAN'sparticiples may be used as substitute for subordinate
clauses in the manner of English 'Having washed the dishes, she sat down',
'He is sitting there reading a book'. However, by inserting ra within a
clause with its own finite verb, one achieves a similar effect to the use of
such participles in English, e.g.

5.2.2.2 Adjectival (Relative) Clauses
5.2.22.1 Construction with full relative pronoun and preposed head
For a full discussion see Hewitt (1985, and 1987 chapter 8); Aronson (1975)
also looks at relative clauses.
When the relative pronouns vin-c 'who', ra-c 'which', romel-i-c 'who,
which' are used, they stand first in the clause (or as part of the first
constituent) and take the case appropriate to their function within the
subordinate clause. The first two do not require the prešence of a head,
e.g.
vin-c
who(NOM)-RElšmo-vid-a,
PREV-PREV-enter-he(AOR)ga-(?Ø-Ø-)u-marj-o-s
PREV-[?it-him-)OVwelcome-AOR.SUBJ-X(?God)'Welcome to (the one) who has entered!'
Where a head is prešent, if it consists of a full lexical noun, then the
third pronoun will be more likely to be used, e.g.
avt'or-i,
ro+ml-is
c'ign-s(a-c)
author-NOM who-GEN
book-DAT(-REl)
'the author whose book they are burning...'(Ø-)c'v-av-en,..
(them-)burn-TS-they6Ø1SYNTAXWhere the head-constituent consists of just a demonstrative pronoun or
such non-specific elements as q'vela 'all', q'vela+per-i 'everything' etc.,
then either vin-c or ra-c will be used, e.g.
i+s,
ra-c
that(NOM) which(NOM)-REl
'What you have is no good'
q'vela,
vin-c
all(NOM) who(NOM)-RElg-a-kv-s,

'Everyone who follows nationalism will betray his country'There is no strict adherence to-number-agreement between head and
relative pronoun; a formally plural head may be followed by a singular
pronoun, whose verb may then be either singular or plural, whilst a
formally singular but semantically plural head may be construed with a
plural form of romel-i-c, e.g.

in OldGEORGIAN(and instances of the reverse assimilation also are attested
there); an example in ModernGEORGIANfrom literary Georgia (13 July
199Ø) would be:6Ø2GEORGIANGRAMMARnu+tu (Ø-)pikr-ob-s, rom, ra-sa-c

'Does X really think that he'll write what he wants?'
which in theory should be: ...rom i+ma-s, ra-c u-nd-a, da-(Ø-)c'er-s.
The general subordinator rom is sometimes found in association with
either ra-c or vin-c, as in this 18th century example from the poet
Guramishvili (quoted form Ertelishvili 1963.7Ø):
vin-c

'let whoever takes exception to being censured do nothing to cause
censure'
For purposes of emphasis the co-referential NP inside the subordinate
clause may be retained alongside the head-noun in the main clause. In
such cases the co-referential NP will be accompanied by romel-i (or ra)
in adjectival function, the relative particle -c attaching to the coreferential NP, e.g.
i+s
saxl-i,
ra//romel saxl-ši((d)a-)c

'the place whither' (adgil-i, sa+it-k'ena-c), 'the place whence' (adgil-i,
sa+i+dana-c), 'the time when' (dro, roca/r(+)o+de+sa-c), 'the reason
why' (mizez-i, ra+t'om(a-c)) are, of course, perfectly acceptable.
In an expression such as 'If you take that money, (an act) which I do
not advise, you will be punished', where the inserted clause refers not to a
specific head but rather to the whole conditional clause,GEORGIANwould
use ra-c and not romel-i-c, e.g6Ø3SYNTAX

78GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
One meets the occasional example (and not infrequently in the works of Vazha
Pshavela) where, in place of the regular expansion in -od- plus Imperfect Indicative
or Prešent Subjunctive endings, the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive of bipersonal
Intransitives are formed after the pattern of monopersonal Intransitives, i.e. by the
addition of the Aorist Indicative or Aorist Subjunctive respectively of the copula.
For example, take the Indirect Verb (and Indirect Verbs are formally identical to
bipersonal Intransitives in Series III) in romel-sa-c še+u+jl+eb+el-i-a e+s
si+t'q'v-eb-i da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-i-q'+o 'who it is impossible to have forgotten these
words' (instead of da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-od-a ); instead of ar m-a-xs+ov-s vin+me
gverd-ze mo-m-jd-om-od-e-s
'I don't recall anyone sitting down beside me' one
may hear the III rd Subjunctive formed as m o - m - j d - o m - i - q ' - o - s . An example is
even available of a monopersonal Perfect replacing the expected bipersonal form: it
is from the now defunct Paris-basedGEORGIANjournal 'šentinel' (No. 29, 1992, p.6Ø):
kart+ul-i p'resa a+m gir+s+še+sa+nišn+av mo+vl+en+a-s ar g a - m o x m a + u r - e b - u l - a 'theGEORGIANpress has not responded to this significant
phenomenon' (in place of the 'correct' ga-mo-(Ø-)xma+ur-eb-i-a ).
KEGl quotes an alternative ending, namely -ev-i(-t) , when the subject is 1st or 2nd
person.
Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would respectively be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-vi-v-a+r-t, da-(Ø-Ø-)xoc-v-i-x-a+r-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-v-i-an
Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(ØØ-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen
This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)bad-eb-od-e-t
'may
you(Pl.) be born to X/them'.
This phonetic form may also mean 'may I/we be born to you(Pl.)' or 'may we be born
to you'.
This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)mal-od-e-t
'may you(Pl.)
hide from X/them'.
This form may also mean 'may I /we stick to you(Pl.)' or 'may we stick to you'.
Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-e-t,
da-(ØØ-)xoc-od-e-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen.
This is short for magalit-ad 'for example', and I simply give here a possible fIIIer
just to offer a flavour of the construction.
Though this is 'regular' insofar as the form is bipersonal, since the Masdar is g a xir-v-a , one would have expected this bipersonal form to be ga-g-xir-v-i-a,
seemingly unattested according to both KEGl and Tschenkčli's dictionary.
N.B. Tschenkčli offers a choice for the participial base of such forms by prešenting a
bracketed element, viz. ga-(Ø-)xir-(eb-)ul-x-a+r .
E.g. ar-c c'in c'a-(?Ø-)e-čr-eb-a, ar-c uk'an ča-mo-dg-eb-a
'X will neither
push himself forward nor step back'.
As in this example: i+ma-s ver v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i, rom šuxart-i srul+i+ad gark'v-e-ul-i-q'-o-s
xan-is (resp.
haes) p'repiks-eb-ad
xmar+eb-is
sa+k'itx-Si 'I shan't be able to say that Schuchardt gained a complete understanding
of the question of the use as prefixes of xan (or hae)'.
As in: čv+e+ul+eba-d m-a-kv-s mo+u+mzad+eb+1-ad ar-sad c'a-v-(?Ø-)ečxir-o 'I have the practice of not getting involved anywhere unprepared'.
An interesting example of the use of such a structurally unmotivated -eb to create a
formal distinction in Series III not found elsewhere in the paradigms is seen in the
case of š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' - e b - i - x - a + r
'you apparently went in exile to place X and
took refuge there', which has Prešent-Future (s'e-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xvec , -eb-i
and Aorist
( š ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e - x v e c ' - e . These Series I and II forms are also used in the šense of
'you (will) beseech X/them', which verb then has the Perfect š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' + n - i - x a+r; this is based on the Masdar ( š ) x v e c ' + n - a 'beseeching; taking refuge', which
would be expected to underlie Series III for the latter of its šenses too. In the caseVERBAl MORPHOlOGY7980

96511of (áe-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xizn-eb-i 'you (will) take refuge in X' (Masdar še-xizvn-a) KEGL
gives the Perfect as še-(Ø-Ø-)xizvn-i-x-a+r , and yet in the illustrations appended
to the relevant entry we find an example of the Pluperfect from Tedo Razik'ashvili
shewing the unmotivated -eb again, viz. bosl-eb-sa da sa+bj+1-eb-s še-(Ø-)
x i z n - e b - o d - n e n 'they had taken refuge in the animal- and grain-barns'.
There can be no doubt about this: KEGL gives as one synonym for (da-)(Ø-)i-c'okeb-a the (transitive) verb-phrase muxl-s (mo-)(Ø-)i-q'r-i-s , where muxl-i = 'knee'
and the verb means 'bend'. Thus, the example arčil-i giorg-is login-tan dačok-il-i-q'+o 'Archil had knelt down at the bed of Giorgi' could be paraphrased as
arčil-s...muxl-i mo-(Ø-)e-q'ar-a. In voluntary buckling of the knees is expressed
by the bipersonal intransitive verb seen in: vin-me-s muxl-i (mo-)(Ø-)e-č'r-eba/Amo-)(Ø-)e-k'vet-eb-a, literally 'the knee is/will be cut//sliced for someone'.
For my review see Hewitt (1983a).
There are two types of exception: (i) Medials which have no Future Sub-Series but
which would have employed this combination of affixes to form the non-existent
screeves, had they existed, and (ii) a small number of irregular Medials which use
only the prefix i- to form the Future Sub-Series.
Taking an example like the following from Literary Georgia (18 Nov 1988, p. 15): c ' a val da šv+il-eb-sa-c da-v-(Ø-)xoc-av, tav-s ar v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb
'I shall go
and kill (my) children; I shall not allow myself to live', we assume tav-s v-(Ø-)icocxl-eb 'I shall allow myself to live' became v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb 'I shall be/remain
alive'.
There are a number of examples where a Series 111 screeve of some Medial is
presented (sc. other than in actual citations from literature) at different places in the
8-volume KEGL, now with the nasal, now without it.
This is the ceremony when, during the lying-in-state at home in the days before the
funeral, visitors come to pay their respects by ritualistic weeping over the corpse.
Some Medials in -av produce their Perfects like normal Transitive Verbs in -av (e.g.
(Ø-)bobg-av = (Ø-)bordg-av = (Ø-)xox-av 'you crawl' have Perfects g - i - b o b g a v - s = g-i-bordg-av-s = g-i-xox-av-s, and yet (Ø-)čoč-av 'you crawl' has the
Perfect g-i-čoč-(?n-)-a!
Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: varaud-ad a+r-i-s 'it is as a supposition'
or s a - v a r a u d - o - a 'it is a matter for supposition'.
Cf. the synonym based on a cognate form: sa-grjn-ob-i-a 'it is perceptible'.
Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: na-gul+is+xm-ev-i-a 'it is meant' or s a gul+is+xm-eb-el-i-a 'it is to be meant'.
Wherever this o-vowel is absent in the paradigm, the labio-dental is restored, as in
the Future (?Ø-)i-gor-av-eb-s 'X will roll around'.
This sort of verb, discussed under 2.5 with reference to sound-symbolism, is a typical
member of the Medial class.
There is also (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'X brings (will bring) rain' (e.g. k a r - i guria-ši
xšir-ad (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'the wind often brings rain to Guria').
With Objective Version we have ši+mš+il-it gul-i m-i-c'ux-s 'my heart is heavy
through hunger', or, from the inceptive, kal-s gul-i (Ø-)u-c'ux-d-eb-od-a
'the
woman's heart was turning sad'.
For both m o - c u r - a v - s and m i - c u r - a v - s there is a full set of paradigms, so that
the meanings respectively are 'X swims (will swim) over here' and 'X swims (will swim)
over there' (=> Aorist m o - / m i - c u r - a => Perfect mo-/mi-(Ø-)u-cur-av-s ).
Note a cognate synonym formed as a bipersonal (but monovalent) Intransitive Verb,
viz. da-(?Ø-)e-xet'-eb-a.
Only the form with indirect object is quoted by KEGL when the preverb is da-.
Note the shift of Thematic Suffix from -ob without indirect object to -eb here. The
verb may be used as in the expression av+ad+m+q'+op-is t'uč-eb-s gim+il-i da-512GEORGI AN GRAMMARs-tamaS-eb-d-a = ga-mo-h-k'rt-od-a 'a smile was playing around the lips of the
sick person'.
97 Note that the preverb here is not in the Prešent Sub-Series.
98 Such formations are not limited to Medials. Consider: c ' a - ( Ø - Ø - ) i - č ' 'you will
have a bite of something to eat'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-loc-av 'you will say a little prayer';
c'a-i-t'rus-eb-a 'X will get a bit scorched'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-)in-eb 'vou will snatch a
bit of sleep'; c'a-i-nam-eb-a 'X will get a bit wet with dew'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xemseb = š ( Ø - ) n a q ' r - d - e b - i 'you will snatch a bite of food'.
99 Cf. the unmarked Intransitive Verb (da-)prtx-eb-i 'you (will) take fright' <= (da-)(ØØ-)a-prtx-ob 'you (will) alarm X/them' or, with ga- as an alternative preverb, 'you
(will) frighten and put to flight'. With this compare (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-prtx+il-eb 'you
(will) warn X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)u-prtx+il-d-eb-i 'you (will) be wary of X/them'
or 'you (will) treat X/them with care'.
100 E.g. delegat'-eb-i si+am+ovn+eb-it (Ø-)p'asux-ob-en q'ovel+gvar t'q'u+ilsa da mo+čven+eb+it še+k'itx+v-eb-s 'the delegates provide answers with
pleasure to every kind of lie and specious question'.
101 Also the indirect object may be the possessor of the subject (e.g. luarsab-s saxe
mudam (Ø-)u-cin-od-a 'luarsab's face was always laughing').
102 Cf. bed-i g-i-gim-i-s 'fate smiles on you' (vs bed-i (?Ø-)g-i-muxtl-eb-s 'fate lets
(will let) you down').
103 Cf. (mo-/mi-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-c , od-eb
-tan 'you (will) issue a call/summons to X/them
to Y', not to be confused with (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-eb
'you (will) hand X/them
to Y/them', produced by back-formation from the Aorist mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-e
which originally had the (stIII extant) Prešent-Future (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'vd-i
with the Intransitive (Ø-)s-c'vd-eb-l 'you reach out and attain/touch X/them'; any
appropriate preverb is used (as indeed for the corresponding Transitive) to produce
the perfective screeves (e.g. Future m o - / m i - / a - 7 g a - / ( 5 a - ( Ø - ) s - c , v d - e b - i =>
Aorist mo-/mi-/a-/ga-/ča-(Ø-)s-c'vd-i
=> Perfect m o - / m i - / a - / g a - / š a - ( Ø - ) s c'vd-om-i-x-a+r).
1Ø4 Note that there is no preverbless Prešent to this Future, for (Ø-Ø)a-)ax-eb is the
(pseudo-)Causative 'you (will) make X/them shout' (Perfect g-i-)ax-eb-i-a ).
1° 5 For mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb cf. Transitive (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xl-i 'you (will)
bring X/them crashing against Y/them; you (will) shoot X/them at Y/them; you (will)
hurl verbal X at Y/them'.
1Ø6 NO form with mo- is quoted.
1Ø7 Note the prešence of the Thematic Suffix -eb, which means that this is not simply
the basic Medial plus preverb.
1Ø8 This example using either of the transitive synonyms would inGEORGIANbe: (i)
Prešent-Future pot-a-mde or dge-s (mo-)v-(Ø-Ø-)a-nd+om-eb
= (še-)v(Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev
si+a+r+ul-s, (ii) Aorist pot-a-mde or-i dge mo-v-(Ø-Ø-)and+om-e = še-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-l-i-e si+a+r+ul-s , (iii) Perfect pot-a-mde or-i dge
mo-m-i-nd+om-eb-1-a = še-m-i-1-ev-i-a si+a+r+ul-is-tvis
109 Presumably a second Dative (such as game-s 'night' or p'eriod-s 'period') is
understood.
110. E.g. č'+a k+on-eb-a-ze h-k'id-i-a 'eating hangs on having' = 'how one eats
depends on what one has'.
111 For which c'ign-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in either
the prešent or the future.
112
One of the two labio-dentals in such collocations may be omitted.
113 For which malmun-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in
either the prešent or the future.
114 The archaic mo-m-e-sm-i-s (etc..) is also sometimes stIII found.
115 For the preverbal form KEGl quotes the Perfect as mo-m-sm-i-a.","[528, 529, 530, 531]"

The non-finite strategy can be used regardless of the tense of the
introductory verb, as long as the purpose is positive (i.e. non-negative) andSYNTAX577most naturally if the SUBJect of the subordinate verb is co-referential with
either the SUBJect or object of the main verb. The subordinate verb stands
in the Adverbial case of the Future Participle. If the verb is Transitive, its
direct object will surface as an objective Genitive, e.g.
ga-mo-(Ø-)i-q'(+)en-a

In the following example it is the indirect object of the main verb who
will perform the action of the Future Participle:
maj-eb-i
ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-švir-e
bork'il-eb-is
wrist-Pl-NOM PREV-I -(3rd.PER-X-)OV-extend-AOR
cuff-Pl-GEN

'I held my wrists to X (sc. for X) to put on the handcuffs'
On page 123 of the 1981 second edition of the complete works of D.
K'ldiashvili there is an example where both the notional direct and indirect
objects end up side by side in the Genitive with such a Future Participle
(viz. q'ru-d q'+op+n-is tav-is da-sa-g+c'-ev-ad deaf-ADV beingGEN head-GEN PREV-FuT.PTC-avoid-TS-ADV
'to avoid being deaf).
However, quoting this very example KEGl put the indirect object into a
postpositional phrase (viz. q'ru-d q'+op+n-isa-gan tav-is da-sa-g+c'e v a d ) — i s the 1981 edition defective, or is the double Genitive a
legitimate treatment paralleling the example quoted in 5.1.5 (namely:
p'at'ar+jal-s sam cT-a-mde ojax-is u+pr+o+s-eb-is xm-is ga-cem-a (Ø-)e-k'rjal-eb-a 'the bride is forbidden to give voice to the
elders of the family for upto three years')? The postpositional treatment of
the indirect object is seen in: k'oncert'-ze da-sa-sc'r-eb-ad č a - m o vid-a 'X came to attend the concert' (cf. k'oncert'-s da-(Ø-)e-sc'r-o 'X
attended the concert'). On the other hand, the Genitive is used in:
vepx+is+t'q'a+osn-is k'val-is mi-sa-gn-eb-ad 'in order to locate the
track of The Man in the Panther's Skin' (cf. k'val-s mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-o 'X
located the track', which is one of the anomalous Transitive verbs with
indirect object but no obvious direct object) and in:578GEORGIANGRAMMARbrošs

An alternative non-finite strategy that makes the Genitive of the
Masdar dependent on m i z n - i t , the Instrumental of m i z a n - i 'aim', is
condemned by purists as a calque on the Russian construction s cel'ju (+
Gen) 'with the aim of...'. However, if one allows it, the relevant section of
the example 'lenin used this pen to write that letter' would be m a g
c'er+l-is da-c'er-is mizn-it.
5.2.2.1.2 Result
The main clause contains an appropriate correlative (e.g. the equivalent of
'so', 'such a', 'to such an extent', 'so many', etc.), and the following
subordinate clause will begin with the conjunction rom 'that' in combination
with a verb in the indicative mood, e.g.
i+k
i+s+e+t-i
mgl-eb-i
da
t'ur-eb-i

PREV-you-devour-they(FuT)SYNTAX579There are such wolves and jackals there that they will devour you'
By changing from 3rd to 1st person deictic marking on the correlative
adverb and by placing it immediately before the rom, we can start a
šentence which, though no longer subordinate, is stIII resultative, e.g.
axal+ga+zrč+oba-ši garda-i-cval-a.
a+s + e

PREV-(it-)us-OV-reališhe(AOR)
'He died in youth. And so (The result was that) he could not realise our
hopes'
Esšentially the same construction as IIIustrated above for the basic
clause of result is employed as equivalent for English structures of the
form 'without V-ing', wherein the subordinate clause will of course contain
a negative, e.g.
i+s
mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme i+s + e, rom
that parasite(NOM) travel-TS-he
usually so
that
bilet-s
ar
(Ø-)q'id+ul-ob-s
ticket-DAT not
(it-)buy-TS-he
That parasite usually travels without buying a ticket'
Note how the ordering of correlative and subordinate clause can invert,
and how then the clitic r o m avoids c l a u š i n i t i a l position: i + s
mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme, bilet-s rom ar (Ø-)q'id(+)ulob-s, i+s+e.
Where the verb has a Privative Participle, it is often possible to
produce an alternative non-finite expression for the meaning 'without
VERBing' by placing the Privative Participle in the Adverbial case, any
direct object of a transitive participle going into the Genitive, e.g.

It is sometimes difficult to draw a clear dividing line between purpose and
result. Such cases have a typical resultative correlative in the main

in mood, e.g.

A range of conjunctions exists to mark causal clauses. Of those that
specifically indicate a reason the most colloquial is ra(+)k'i, the least
colloquial is vina+i+dan, whilst ra+d+gan(a+c) holds a middle position.

"2GEORGI AN GRAMMARTable 1: Family-tree of the Kartvelian LanguagesWithin Georgia itself, as indicated on the accompanying map, Svan is
spoken in the high mountain-valleys of the rivers Enguri and Cxenis-c'q'ali
in the north-western region of Svaneti(a), east of Abxazia. Mingrelian is
located in Mingrelia, the lowland area of West Georgia that is bounded by
Abxazia, Svaneti(a), Imereti and Guria. As for Georgian, its many and
diverse dialects are: Ač'aran, Gurian, Imeretian in the west, Lečxumian,
Rač'an in the north-west, Mtiulur-Gudamaq'rulian, Moxevian in the north,
Xevsurian, Pshavian and Tush in the north-east, K'ax(et)ian in the east,
Mesxian, Dzhavaxian in the south(-west), and Kartlian in the centre. The
literary dialect, which is described below, is based on the speech of the
province of Kartli, in which the capital Tbilisi is situated.
It might be appropriate to observe at this point that, although the
Georgians on the whole profess (Orthodox) Christianity, as a result of
Turkish influence the natives of Ač'ara adopted Islam. The interplay of
religion and ethnicity is also relevant with regard to the S.W. province of
Mesxeti. On 15th November 1944 144,000 (according to the figure most
regularly quoted) residents of the area and adherents of Islam were exiled
to Soviet Central Asia, a fate that was suffered by a number of Soviet
peoples around the time of World War 11 (Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans,
and from the N. Caucasus Balkars, Karachays, Chechens and Ingush).
Though acknowledged under Khrushchëv to have been guilty of no crimes
(such as treason), these Mesx(et)ians have not yet secured permission to
return to their homeland, principally because of opposition from the
government of Georgia, and many had to be hurriedly evacuated from
Uzbekistan following the inter-ethnic conflict that flared up in the
Ferghana Valley in 1989. These people are usually referred to as
«Mesx(et)ian Turks», and it has been suggested that they were removed
from the border-area because of their pro-Turkish sympathies in advanceINTRODUCTION3of a possible Soviet incursion into Turkey. The precise ethnic allegiance
of the possibly 300,000 who wish to return to Georgia is a matter of
dispute: are they turkified Georgians or ethnic Turks, descended from
those who settled in an area regarded by Georgians as primaeval Georgian
land when it became the border between Georgia and Ottoman Turkey?
The arguments put forward in support of Georgia's refusal to allow their
resettlement are that: (a) the region has been repopulated, (b) there is no
room elsewhere in Georgia either, (c) Christian Georgians have always
been, and still are being, threatened by adherents of Islam*, so that to
accept the influx of so many muslims, especially along their border with
Turkey, would be to invite trouble. The most that has been offered is
resettlement somewhere within Georgia of those who (a) vow allegiance to
Georgia, (b) know, or will learn, Georgian, (c) have, or will adopt, Georgian
surnames, and (d) convert to Christianity.
1.1 The Languages of the Caucasus
The Caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the multiplicity of
languages spoken there. In the 10th century the Arab al-Mas'udi named it
«the mountain of tongues» (Catford 1977). A variety of language-families
are represented there, such as Indo-European (Ossetic, Armenian, Russian)
and Turkic (Azeri, Kumyx), but apart from these there are at least three,
possibly four, autochthonous families. In addition to Kartvelian the others
are: North West Caucasian (Abxaz-Abaza, Circassian, Ubyx), North Central
Caucasian (Chechen, Ingush, Bats), North East Caucasian (Avar, Andi,
Botlix, Ghodoberi, K'arat'a, Axvax, Bagval, T'indi, C'amalal, Dido, Xvarsh,
Hinux, Bezhti, Hunzib, Lak', Dargwa, Lezgi(an), Tabassaran, Arči, Aghul,
Rutul, Ts'axur, Budux, Xinalugh, Udi, K'ryts'. North Central and North East
Caucasian are treated by most as a single family. In fact, all the northern
families may be genetically related. From the above-list Abxaz and Bats
are spoken not in the geographical north Caucasus but within the republic
of Georgia (cf. §1.6 below).
All these indigenous languages are characterised by the presence of an
ejective series of consonants, and all apart from modern Mingrelian have
normally been accepted as manifesting to a greater or lesser degree the
phenomenon of ergativity, though this issue with respect to Georgian
continues to foster much lively debate (see Hewitt 1983, 1987a, 1989 and
1995 for the details). If North West Caucasian as a family can be thought
of as being marked by large consonantal inventories with correspondingly
minimal vowel-systems and also by polysynthetic verb-forms with
correspondingly simple morphology within the nominal system, elsewhere in4GEORGIAN GRAMMARthe north Caucasus one tends to find complex vowel-systems and rich
morphology for the noun, balanced by relatively straightforward verbs.
Kartvelian occupies a middle position by virtue of having (a) a reasonable
proportion of consonants to vowels (even if, as shewn later, there is a
surprising tolerance of consonant-complexes), and (b) a comparative
complexity within both nominal and verbal morphology.
1.2 The Georgian Scripts
Georgian is unique amongst not only the Kartvelian languages but also the
38 or so autochthonous languages of the Caucasus as a whole in possessing
an unbroken literary tradition of some 15 centuries; though some attempts
were made in the 19th century to establish scripts for other indigenous
languages in the region, those that today have literary status in the former
USSR really only gained this in any meaningful sense following the
establishment of Soviet power. Two legends are associated with the
creation of the Georgian script—(a) that it was devised by King Parnavaz
in the 4th/3rd centuries B.C., (b) that Armenian Bishop Mesrop Mashtots
invented it c.400 A.D. along with the Armenian script and that of the «lost»
Caucasian Albanians. Most, however, would concur that it was probably
created some time in the 4th century (Ts'ereteli 1960), on the model of
contemporary Greek (Gamq'relidze 1989), in order to facilitate the spread
of Christianity, introduced in the 330s. The earliest inscription dates from
C.430 at the Georgian church founded by Peter the Iberian in the Judaean
desert near Bethlehem; within Georgia the oldest inscription hails from 494
at the Bolnisi Sion (60 kilometres to the south from Tbilisi).
During its history Georgian has had three scripts, all written from left
to right and lacking the distinction between upper and lower cases: (a) from
the 5th to the 9th century mrg(v)lovani
'rounded' (otherwise called
asomtavruli
'majiscule') was used; (b) from this developed
k'utxovani
'angular' (or nusxuri 'miniscule'), which, having made its first appearance in
the testament appended to the Sinai Polycephalon of 864, continued to be
used for most manuscripts written in the 10th/11th centuries—within such
manuscripts the earlier script was employed in the function of capitals; (c)
the modern mxedruli 'military, secular' script evolved from its predecessor
in the 11th century. However, the Church continued to use the older scripts
for sacred texts, such that the generic term xucuri 'ecclesiastical' came to
be adopted jointly to distinguish them from their mutual descendant. The
modern script has 33 characters and is fully phonemic; Old Georgian used
5 additional characters, which are bracketed in their mxedruli-forms in the
table that follows:INTRODUCTION5Table 2: The Three Scripts of Georgian

1.3 The History of Georgian Philology
The earliest known work in Georgian to deal with philological issues in the
language, namely A Treatise on Articles, was discovered by Mzekala
Shanidze (1984) as part of the 11th-12th century manuscript No.6 from the
collection of the I veron Monastery on Mt. Athos, a work she tentatively
attributes to the scholar Eprem Mtsire. Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725)
produced the first native dictionary in 1716, whilst the first grammar of the6GEORGI AN GRAMMARlanguage written in Georgian belongs to Zurab Shanshovani (1737), followed
in 1753 and 1767 by versions of a more comprehensive description by
Patriarch Ant'on I (1720-1788). A number of grammatical works appeared
through the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was essentially in the
writings of T h e Father of Modern Georgian Philology', Ak'ak'i Shanidze
(February 1887-March 1987), that Georgian grammar finally came of age.
His monumental Fundamentals of the Georgian Language, most recently re­
printed in 1980, will long remain the ultimate reference for all students of
Georgian morphology once they have gained a reading-knowledge of the
language. The Georgian Academy published the 8-volume Explanatory
Dictionary of the Georgian Language (KEGL, in abbreviation of its native
title, viz. kart+ul-i en-is gan+mart'+eb+it-i leksik'on-i) between
1950 and 1964 under the general editorship of Arnold Cikobava, who
contributed his own grammatical sketch in volume 1. I ndeed, it has to be
said that the preparation of this grammar was greatly facilitated by the
invaluable information provided by this magnificent work, for apart from
using the volumes to check the existence and morphology of many of the
verb-forms quoted, I made lavish use of the illustrations included in the
various articles consulted, many of which are quoted as presented, though
in other cases I reduced the content for concentration on the feature in
question. Working so intimately with these volumes over the months, I
came to appreciate even more than I had before just how indispensable
they are for any serious student of Georgian. I know that this dictionary
has been the target of a good deal of criticism over the years, but I am
happy to speak strongly in its defence here. It has the unparalleled
advantage over any other dictionary of Georgian in its inclusion of so much
illustrative material from attested usage. One of the great desiderata in
Kartvelology is for a really good bilingual dictionary including illustrative
material of just this kind, and the first step in any such project would
surely be to render the Georgian definitions in KEGL into some appropriate
second language (like English!) and then to publish the result in a single
volume with a greatly reduced size of font on good quality thin paper, after
the fashion of The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. If such a project
could be financed, at least two observations should be borne in mind: (i) the
long quotes from the published works of Stalin that rather burden volumes
1-4 could usefully be pruned or replaced, and (ii) since citations are with
3rd person subject (and object(s)), it is not always possible to predict the
form of a verbal root in some paradigms when the subject (or direct object)
is 1st or 2nd person (e.g. given ga-(Ø-)č'r-a 'X cut Y/them', it is not
possible to predict that 'I cut X/them' is ga-v-(Ø-)č'er-i with root
expanded by -e-), so that this information should either be given as part ofINTRODUCTION7the citation for relevant verbs, or appropriate examples should be included
in the illustrative materials, which goal KEGL does not always achieve—
see the suggestions along these lines I made in Hewitt (1991a). Without
KEGL whatever value the present volume may have would have been
considerably diminished. Useful articles will also be found in the ongoing
series Questions on the Culture of Georgian Speech, whose 9th volume
appeared in 1989. Numerous dialectal words are contained in the various
volumes of Materials on the History of Georgia's Domestic Industry and
Craftsmanship (in Georgian), which began publication in 1976.
Foreign investigation of Georgian began in the 17th century with the
work of Italian missionaries—for the history of the study of Caucasian
languages in general see (the Mingrelian) Arnold Chikobava (1965). In 1629
there were published in Rome the Alphabetum Ihericum, sive Georgianum,
cum Oratione Dominicali and S. Paolini's Georgian-Italian Dictionary. In
1643 M. Maggio followed these with his Georgian Grammar. Facsimiles of
these three bibliographical rarities were published in Tbilisi in 1983 under
the title First Printed Books in Georgian (Xelovneba). F. Bopp, M. Brosset
and H. Schuchardt dealt with aspects of Georgian in the 19th century, and
in 1904 A. Dirr produced his short Theoretisch-praktische Grammatik der
modernen georgischen [grusinischen] Sprache (Leipzig). More recent works
that may be consulted with profit are: G. Deeters Das
kharthwelische
Verbum (Leipzig, 1930), K. Tschenkéli Einführung in die georgische Sprache
Georgisch-Deutsches
(Zürich, 1958) in two volumes, as well as his
Wörterbuch in three volumes (1965-1974), which is easily the most
outstanding of any of the bilingual dictionaries currently available, H. Vogt
Grammaire de la langue géorgienne (Paris, 1971), H. Aronson Georgian—A
Reading Grammar (Chicago, 1982 & 1990)2, H. Fähnrich Kurze Grammatik
der georgischen Sprache (Leipzig, 1986), whilst for Old Georgian there is
this same scholar's 1982 German translation of A. Shanidze's short Grammar
of the Old Georgian Language (both the original (1976) and the translation
published in Tbilisi) as well as in his own right a grammatical sketch of
1991 and now the monograph Grammatik der altgeorgischen
Sprache
(Hamburg, 1994). My own Georgian: A Learner's Grammar (Routledge,
1995b) is now available as a self-tutor for English-speaking readers.
Standing at the intersection of Europe and Asia and occupying an
important strategic position in the Transcaucasus, Georgia has been
regarded as an attractive prize by more powerful peoples since time
immemorial. Græco-Roman, Persian, Arabic, Turkish and, latterly, Russian
influences have all left their traces on the language, especially in respect
of the lexicon. The Academy Dictionary (KEGL) states the provenance of
many foreign lexemes, and in 1964 M. C'abashvili published a dictionary of8GEORGI AN GRAMMARforeign words. The standard reference for Georgian-Iranian linguistic
contacts is the 1966 monograph by Mzia Andronik'ashvili. For ArmenoKartvelian contacts see Vogt (1938 & 1988).
1.4 The Development of the Georgian Literary Language
The natural dynamics of language-change have rendered Modern Georgian
somewhat different from its earliest attested predecessor. Given the
existence of 15 centuries of material, the urge to periodise is strong, and
the standard divisions are: 5th-11th centuries for Old Georgian, 12th-18th
centuries for Mediaeval Georgian, 19th century for the start of Modern
Georgian. However, Sardzhveladze (1984.253-275) counsels caution over
too ready an acceptance of even the basic assumption that clearly defined
breaks can be imposed on what is rather a continuum. He points out that
the period commonly thought of as representing Old Georgian is not itself
linguistically uniform, so that recognition of a certain set of changes would
justify the establishment of at least the two sub-periods (a) 5th-8th and (b)
9th-11th centuries (ibid.269ff.). The problem thereafter is that the extant
texts begin to cover other areas than the purely ecclesiastical, such that
linguistic style is to a degree determined by subject-matter, with ancient
norms prevailing but starting to be rivalled by features from the spoken
language. The Church continued to regard the classical language as the
only appropriate medium for worship and literature, with the result that, as
time passed, the language was being written according to norms that were
becoming ever more out of date and less understood. The move to rid the
literary language of this artificiality and to re-invigorate it by aligning it
with the type of Georgian people actually spoke was part of the general
movement for Georgia's national revival in the latter half of the 19th
century—for the most recent account of this period see Suny (1989.113­
MS; reprinted 1994). The most prominent supporter of modernisation was
the writer and political activist, Prince Ilia C'avc'avadze (1837-1907), who
is now universally regarded as the 'Father of the modern Georgian nation'
and who was canonised by the Georgian Church on the 150th anniversary
of his birth.
1.5 Georgian Literature
The first native work of Georgian literature (i.e. other than translations)
was Iak'ob Tsurt'aveli's Martyrdom of St. Shushanik (šušanik'is c'ameba),
which, though written between the years 476 and 483, has come down to us
in manuscripts that date from no earlier than the 10th century—aINTRODUCTION9monumental 7-language edition was published in Tbilisi in 1983 (Xelovneba).
The oldest dated manuscript thus far discovered is the Sinai Polycephalon
of 864. The oldest dated manuscript of any part of the Bible is that of the
Adysh Gospels, named after the small Svanetian village in which it was
discovered in the 19th century; its date is 897, and it was copied in the
Shat'berd monastery, one of the most important cultural centres in
Mediaeval Georgia's south-western province of K'lardzheti (present-day E.
Turkey). The most famous work of the mediaeval period is, of course, Shota
Rust(a)veli's great epic The Man in the Panther's Skin (in Georgian
vepxist'q'aosani), composed c.1200 A.D. in Georgia's Golden Age under
Queen Tamar (1184-1213). It consists of 1598 quatrains, end-rhyming for
the final two or three syllables, the best English translation of which is
undoubtedly that by Marjory Wardrop (1912 & 1966). Mention should also
be made of the chronicles known as kartlis cxovreba 'History of Georgia'
(literally 'Life of Kartli'), an English translation of part of which is now
available (Vivian 1991). The three most important literary figures of the
late 19th, early 20th century were Ilia C'avč'avadze, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli
(1840-1915), and Vazha Pshavela, pseudonym of Luk'a Razik'ashvili (18611915), all perhaps best loved for their poetical works and affectionately
known in Georgia by merely their Christian names. The finest prose-writer
of this century is deemed by many to be the Mingrelian K'onst'ant'ine
Gamsaxurdia (1891-1975), who, like Pasternak, spoke out against, and yet
somehow survived, the purges of the 'thirties—others would perhaps award
this accolade to Mixeil Dzhavaxishvili, who did not survive the purges. For
a summary of Georgian history, both political and cultural, see Salia (1975),
whilst Rayfield (1994) provides an encyclopaedic reference-guide to
Georgian literature.
1.6 Demography
According to the 1989 Soviet census there were 3,983,115 «Georgians» in
the USSR, of whom 3,787,393 resided in Georgia, where they comprised
70.1%of the republic's population. However, this total is misleading. In the
1926 census 242,990 citizens declared Mingrelian nationality, and 13,218
Svan nationality. Sometime thereafter, probably around 1930, it seems to
have been decided that these peoples were to be reclassified as
«Georgians», with the result that these minor nationalities simply
disappeared from subsequent censuses. Although in 1989 individuals again
had the right to describe themselves as belonging to the nationality they,
rather than officialdom, deemed appropriate, very few chose (for whatever
reason) to deviate from the post-1926 orthodoxy. One consequence of this10GEORGI AN GRAMMARis that there are no accurate figures for the Svan, Mingrelian and Laz
populations of Georgia, though 40,000 plus is usually quoted for Svans, and
up to one million for Mingrelians. More serious for the linguist is the
absence of data on the strength of native-speaker knowledge of all four
Kartvelian languages within Georgia. During the Soviet period all Svans as
well as the vast majority of Mingrelians and Georgians (proper) have been
educated through the medium of Georgian. The status of Georgian as the
local literary lingua franca together with the facts that (a) Georgian,
Mingrelian, Laz and Svan clearly derive from a common source, and (b)
their speakers generally share a long Christian tradition within the
Georgian Orthodox Church appears to be the main argument in defence of
viewing these peoples as one «Georgian» race. The origin of this confused
thinking is perhaps to be sought in the Georgian language itself. A
Georgian calls himself kart-v-el-i
(cf. sa-kart-v-el-o 'Georgia'),
whereas anything non-human but Georgian is kart-ul-i. The Georgian
expression for 'Kartvelian languages' is kart-v-el-ur-i
en-eb-i.
Regrettably, the language lacks the equivalent epithet for humans (*kartv-el-el-i ), with the result that kart-v-el-i 'Georgian' remains the (as
yet!) only available description. Since in English both 'Kartvelian' and
'Georgian' exist, there is no reason to overload the latter with an illogical
ambiguity.
Any attempt to argue for the non-Georgian status of
Mingrelians and Svans regularly excites a ferocious response in Georgia
(for details see Hewitt 1995a). Could this be the result of an exaggerated
desire to present their nation as more numerous (and thus stronger) than it
actually is? How else does one explain the fact that even the few thousand
North Central Caucasian Bats (Ts'ova-Tush) people, who reside exclusively
in the K'ax(et)ian village of Zemo Alvani and whose mother-tongue is in no
way related to Georgian, are equally fiercely portrayed as «Georgians» (cf.
Itonishvili 1990)? For a recent etymology of the ethnonym-root kart-v-,
which derives it from the more familiar ethnonym 'Parthian', see Shanidze
(1978).
Though united as a great feudal power from the time of David IV
(nicknamed 'The Builder', 1089-1125) through the «Golden Age» under
Queen Tamar (1184-1213) to the appearance of the Mongols in the second
quarter of the 13th century, the concept of Georgia as a single socio­
political unit did not really exist again until the birth of the revivalistmovement in the latter half of the 19th century, alluded to above. Thus,
despite its long and distinguished literary tradition, one could argue that
Georgia is quite a young nation. Despite frequent inter-regional feuding in
the past the one thing that the Georgians have always had in common is
their language, and a plausible case could be made for saying that theirINTRODUCTION11pride in, and loyalty towards, their language have contributed greatly in
helping to ensure the survival of the nation in the face of all the perils
thrown up by history. At the same time, though, such devotion can be
taken to extremes. The belief is widespread that the language suffered
repression from Russia in favour of Russian throughout the Soviet period
(1921-1991), whereas, in contradistinction to the treatment meted out to
Georgian through much of the period of Tsarist rule in the 19th century,
more objective observers would surely conclude that Georgian was given
the opportunity actually to flourish during those 70 Soviet years when it
benefited from enjoying the constitutional status as the state-language of
one of the USSR's constituent republics (Hewitt 1985, 1989a), with universal
publishing of both newspapers and books, radio- and televisionbroadcasting, and the possibility of completing the educational process
from kindergarten through university in the mother-tongue. When in 1978
the first draft for the Brezhnevite constitution made no specific mention of
Georgian being the main republican language, demonstrations forced the
then 1st Secretary, Eduard Shevardnadze, to remedy the omission, as one
may see by consulting Article 75. However, not everyone in Georgia
speaks Georgian, even as a 2nd (or 3rd) language. Consider the 1989
census-data:

the main means of communication is Russian, followed by Mingrelian, since
the vast majority of the 239,872 Kartvelians resident here at the time were
in fact Mingrelians. I n those areas where Mingrelians were found
(predominantly in the southern half of the autonomous republic) the nonKartvelian locals have traditionally had 2nd or 3rd language command of it.
Since Georgian was little heard here, only those who attended Georgianlanguage schools (viz. the Kartvelians) could naturally be expected to have
had a good knowledge of it. In the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast'
(Region) Georgians were in a clear minority, as shewn by the 1989 censusdata:

1.01.7 The Language-issue
Just as the position of the Georgian language played an important role in
the 19th century revivalist movement, so it soon surfaced again at the time
of nationalist stirrings in the wake of the weakening of authoritarian
controls from Moscow in the late 1980s. The first draft of T h e State
Programme for the Georgian Language', published in November 1988,INTRODUCTION13contained three crucial clauses proposing:
(13) The creation in all institutions and enterprises of favourable conditions
for citizens of non-Georgian nationality living in the republic to master the
Georgian language;
(111 10) The working out of proposals concerning the possibility of
introducing in the republic's non-Georgian (Russian, Armenian,
Azerbaydzhani, Abxazian and Ossetic) schools Georgian-language teaching
according to obligatory rule;
(111 16) The introduction of theoretical and practical courses in the
Georgian language at Georgia's higher educational establishments in the
faculties of Russian language and literature, Abxazian language and
literature, Ossetic language and literature, Armenian language and
literature, and Azeri language and literature.
In the final draft, ratified by the Georgian government in August 1989,
these three clauses were altered to read as follows:
(16) The creation in all institutions and enterprises (with financial and
teaching-methodological safeguards) of favourable conditions for citizens
living within the republic who have no knowledge of the Georgian language
to master the Georgian language;
(11113) The working out of concrete proposals concerning the introduction
of the obligatory teaching of the Georgian language in the republic's nonGeorgian schools;
(11114) The introduction of an oral test in Georgian language and literature
prior to entrance-exams for prospective students of non-Georgian sectors
at the higher educational establishments of the Georgian SSR;
(111 15) The introduction of courses in the practical stylistics of the
Georgian language and the history of Georgian language and literature in
the non-Georgian sectors of the philology faculty at the higher educational
establishments of the Georgian SSR.
The director of the Linguistics Institute of the Georgian Academy of
Sciences at the time said as an apparent after-thought at the end of a
television-discussion to celebrate The Programme's promulgation that the14GEORGI AN GRAMMARnon-Kartvelian population should in no way feel threatened by these
proposals, which, he claimed, were only designed to facilitate their learning
of Georgian. It is clear, however, that, whether an individual nonKartvelian felt he needed it or not for his daily life and work, he was going
to be forced to learn Georgian at the school of his choice and would have
to achieve a certain proficiency in it if he wished to receive higher
education in what has always been a multi-ethnic republic. If these
requirements are considered in conjunction with populist suggestions at the
time that knowledge of Georgian should be one of the pre-requisities for
obtaining citizenship in an independent Georgia, one will perhaps judge the
post-1988 apprehensions among many of the non-Kartvelians (especially
Abxazians 5 , Ossetes, Armenians and Azerbaydzhanis) in Georgia to be fully
justified. Hitherto Georgian language had been merely an optional subject
in the republic's Russian, Armenian, Azerbaydzhani, Ossetic and Abxazian
schools (for details see Hewitt 1989a).
If the proposition advanced above is correct, namely that the troubles
that began in 1989 sprang at least in part from the nationalists' forced
promotion of Georgian through The State Programme, then one could
conclude that a wiser step would have been to draw up a detailed
statement as to how all of the languages of this small, cosmopolitan land
would be safeguarded in a sovereign Georgia. In this way respect for
language could have become a source of unity rather than a factor in the
discord which led to the ferocious war in South Ossetia under the
Gamsaxurdia regime and the even bloodier conflict in Abxazia (August
1992-September 1993), as a result of which both these provinces are today
(1995) de facto independent of a disintegrating Georgia. As it is, the
continuing welfare of Georgian can hardly be doubted, though the same
cannot be said for its sister-languages Svan, Mingrelian and Laz, whose
only mention in The State Programme is in connection with their meriting
the same rights of study as Georgian's dialects proper. However, at the
time of writing it is not the continued viability of these languages that is at
issue but the very viability of the Republic of Georgia itself!
1.8 Scope of the present work
Though the general linguist will, I trust, find in the following pages
whatever he may desire to know about the workings of the Georgian
language, as it now stands this book represents my attempt to consign to
paper in the form of a fully-fledged reference grammar all the knowledge
of (as well as, I hope, the odd insight into) this challenging language that I
have acquired over the last twenty years of close study. Because of theINTRODUCTION15structure of the language it is no accident that the largest chapter below is
that devoted to the morphology of the verb. However, I have endeavoured
to give the fullest possible information also about the language's syntax,
since this is an area that is often cursorily treated, especially by native
linguists in the Caucasus.
The chapter on syntax begins with a
recapitulation of the essentials of the overall properties of the language
discussed in chapters 3 and 4, so that those primarily interested in
questions of syntax might be able to derive some benefit from the syntactic
descriptions presented in chapter 5 without necessarily having to master
all of the complex morphology that precedes them.
With the publication of my course-book for Georgian in twenty lessons
for Routledge (1995b) and the imminent appearance of my Georgian Reader
(SOAS), I now draw this chapter in my linguistic endeavours to a close,
leaving it to others to work on this language in the certainty that its future
is fully secure; henceforth I shall concentrate on at least two of the
languages in the Caucasus about whose future the same happy prediction
can sadly not be made, namely Abxaz and Mingrelian—the irony is, one
could argue, that it is in the very success of Georgian that the threat to
these languages and cultures lies.
1.9 Principles of Citation
All words are divided into constituent morphemes. Morpheme-boundaries
are indicated either by the hyphen or a plus-sign, the latter (+) being used
either when the identity of each morpheme is not important to the
particular phenomenon being explained (and thus they are not individually
glossed in those instances where morpheme-analyses are provided) or when
it is suspected that a morpheme-boudary is present but the precise analysis
might be unclear. For example, we could gloss each component of the Past
Participle 'baked' thus:
ga-mo-m-cxv-ar-i
Preverb-Preverb-Past.Participle.Prefix-bake-Past.Participle.SuffixAgreement.Marker
but it would normally be important only to know that this word is a verbal
adjective meaning 'baked', and it would therefore usually be presented
simply as:
ga+mo+m+cxv+ar-i
baked-AGR
'baked'
To illustrate the second case let us take the verbal noun (Masdar) of
the copula, q'+op+n-a, where the Masdar-formant is the final -a.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"

Benjamin-SOAS series of which it is a part, of presenting the essential
structural characteristics of Georgian for the benefit of general linguists.
As it progressed, however, it turned into something more than this. It had
been my aim to write a reference grammar of Georgian after a further ten
years or so of study, but the request from the Series' editors, Professor
Thea Bynon and Professor Matt Shibatani, to contribute a description of
Georgian happened to coincide with an unforeseen rift in my relations with
Georgia which is unlikely to be repaired. And so, rather than continue to
study this language, to which I was introduced seriously in 1975 when I
travelled to Tbilisi as a Cambridge post-graduate student for a year of
intensive learning on a British Council exchange, as, now of necessity for
me, a virtual dead language, I decided that it was time to kill three birds
with one stone. In marshalling here the sum total of the knowledge that I
have acquired over the last twenty years I hope (a) to have satisfied the
faith placed in my ability by Professors Bynon and Shibatani to write a
grammar of use for the general linguist, (b) to have produced a worthwhile
reference-grammar (the first in English) that it had always been my desire
to compose, and (c) to end thereby the period when Georgian has
represented the main focus of my study and research. If I succeed in
easing even a few people's passage through the waiting mysteries, I shall
conclude the last 20 years to have been well spent.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"152GEORGIANGRAMMAROn p. 17 of S. Mak'alatia's History and Ethnography of Mingrelia we find
in virtually identical contexts the Past Participle meaning 'preserved', and
yet in one case še- alone is used, whilst in the other we have še-mo-, viz.
mcire
cn+ob-eb-i-a
jvel berjn+ul m+c'er+l+oba-ši
negligible report-Pl-NOM-is old
Greek
literature-in
še+nax+ul-i
preserved-NOM
'few reports are preserved in Ancient Greek literature'
vs berjn+ul c'q'aro-eb-ši mcire cn+ob-eb-i-a še+mo+nax+ul-i 'in
Greek sources few reports are preserved'.
No example was offered above for the preverbs c ' a - / c ' a - m o - , c'abasically indicating 'forward' (cf. c'in 'in front, before, ahead'), in the
Prešent of the verb of motion. This is because such couplings are not
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. However, elsewhere in the paradigm
these preverbs do come into play, and the question arises as to how one
differentiates between, say, the Futures c'a-va and rni-va, both signifying
'X will go'. The answer is that c'a- emphasises the departure and
journeying, whilst mi- implies reaching the destination (e.g. bič'-i c'a-va
sk'ola-ši 'the lad will go to school' vs bič'-i mi-va buxar-tan 'the lad
will go upto the stove'). The same interplay is observed with the verb for
'take'—in the Prešent Sub-Series only mi- is possible, e.g.
eg c'ign-i
sad
mi-g-a-kv-s?
that book-NOM where? PREV-you-lV-take-it
'Where are you taking that book?'
whereas elsewhere the same nuances as just described attach to the
preverbs mi- and c'a-, e.g.
malamo
tan
c'a-(Ø-Ø-)-t'an-e! (= c'a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e!)
ointment(NOM) along PREV-(you-it-)SV-take-AOR.INDIC(=IMPER)
'take the ointment along with you!'
vs
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-ma
teacher-ERGk'las-ši mi-(Ø-)i-t'an-a
class-into PREV-(it-)SV-take-she(AOR)c'ign-i
bookNOM'the teacher took the book to the class'
The difference between mo- and c'a-mo- is that the former indicatesVERBAl MORPHOlOGY153simple motion towards speaker or hearer, whereas the latter implies motion
'away' towards or with speaker or hearer (e.g. mo-(Ø-)di a+k! 'come
here!' vs c'a-mo-(Ø-)i, ert+ad c'a-vid-e-t! 'Come on away/along, let's
go together!', or:
mo-(Ø-)i-ca,
čven-c
PREV-(you-)SV-wait(I MPER) we(NOM)-tooc'a-mo-val-t
PREV-PREVcome(lst.PER)-Pl'Hold on, we'll come along too')
From their original role as markers of directionality/orientation the
preverbs took on the function of marking perfective aspect with the result
that today for the bulk of verbs in the Transitive and Intransitive classes
the relevant preverb will usually be prešent in screeves other than those
of the Prešent Sub-Series. The addition of the appropriate (and usually
unpredictable) preverb to the Prešent Indicative of most Transitive or
Intransitive verbs produces the Future Indicative (e.g. (Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s
'X does/makes Y/them' => ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s 'X will do/make Y/them').
In OldGEORGIANthere was no independent Future Indicative screeve, the
Prešent or Aorist Subjunctive as appropriate (sc. according to aspect)
making up the deficiency. The association of root with preverb can then
come to play a lexical role, for by altering the preverb from ga- to šewith the root -k'et- we produce a verb-form with the lexical meaning
'repair' (e.g. ro+di+s še-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-en a+m t'elevizor-s? 'When
will they repair this television?'), the preverbless Prešent (Sub-Series) forms
being ambiguous out of context for the meanings 'do/make' vs 'repair'.
Another example would be the verb 'kill' which normally takes the preverb
m o - (e.g. bič'-ma baq'aq'-i mo-(Ø-)k'l-a 'the lad killed the frog'), but if
the killing is with a knife (typically of an animal slaughtered in ritualistic
sacrifice or for preparation as food), then the preverb da- takes over, e.g.
dia+saxl+is-ma katam-i
da-(Ø-)k'l-a
da
housewife-ERG
chicken-NOM PREV-(it-)kill-she(AOR) and
(Ø-)gv-a-č'am-a
(it-)us-lV-feed-she(AOR)
'the housewife killed the chicken (sc. by slitting its throat) and fed it to
us'
These couplings do not exhaust the possibilities for the root 'kill', and
the range of couplings well illustrates the way the inter-dependencies of
root and preverb (as well as Version) complicate the lexical structure of154GEORGI AN GRAMMARthe language. Consider:
e + s si+q'var+ul-i kal-ma
ča-(Ø-)k'l-a
this love-NOM
woman-ERG PREV-(it-)suppress-she(AOR)
gul-ši
heart-in

'several men sacrificed themselves to that great affair'
Also consider (da-)(Ø-Ø-)loc-av 'you (will) bless X/them' vs (äe-/gamo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-loc-av 'you (will) mouth a healing mantra over X/them'.
The reason for the choice of preverb in most of the examples in the
previous paragraph is, I think, opaque—synonymous roots can be found
which, despite their parallel semantics, take different preverbs (e.g. da-scin-eb = ga-kird-av 'you will mock X'). Sometimes, the change can be
explained in terms of the original directional force of the preverb and the
basic lexical meaning of the root is little altered. The normal preverb for
-ngr- 'ruin' is da-, e.g.
revolucia-m
da-(Ø-)a-ngr-i-a
sa+zizg+ar-i
revolution-ERG PREV-(it-)NV-ruin-TS-it(AOR) loathsome-AGR
monarkia
monarchy(NOM)
'the Revolution destroyed the loathsome monarchy'
However, examples can be quoted where ruin/destruction is emphasisedVERBAl MORPHOlOGY155to have occurred in some particular direction by a change of preverb, e.g.

'the cells whose doors are destroyed (sc. knocked out hither)'It might be instructive to take a single root, namely -sc'r- whose basic
šense is something like 'do in time, anticipate in doing', and quote examples
for all the preverbal couplings listed in KEGl for both transitive and
intransitive forms to give an idea of how a preverb's directional/orientational force can shade off into a role of part-lexical formant:

'we always imagined there to be loaves in the chest if a harvestless

Intransitives it is usual for a preverb to be prešent in the verbal complex.
In Series II, however, and less commonly perhaps in Series III, one may
find finite Transitive (very rarely Intransitive) verbs without the expected
preverb. The nuance attaching to such forms is that an action, expressed
as aspectually non-durative (hence the use of Series II), nevertheless does
not reach its natural conclusion, which would motivate the prešence of the
preverb as marker of perfective aspect. Consider the contrast between
preverbless and preverbal forms in the proverb:

'this is not an affair that is easily to be accomplished, but it is
demanded of you that we do it' (Literary Georgia, 18 Jan 1991, p.7)At first glance this would appear to refer to a quite specific affair and
therefore to require the preverb ga-. However, the previous šentence
reads: 'It is our duty to purify the path for the national movement of all
sorts of falsehood and overpower on this road the enemy's tricks,
deceptions and illusions'. In other words, the sa + km + e in question
involves a whole series of individual actions, the fulfilment of each one of
which will not necessarily result in the completion of the series overall,
hence the lack of the preverb.
Just as in the Future Participle of the last example, the non-finite
verbal noun (Masdar) may be used without the anticipated preverb. The
following examples from a single article in the paper droni Times' (11 Oct
1991, p.7) shew how difficult it can be to distinguish between preverbal and
preverbless forms, for in both instances we have the same verbal root
dependent upon the main verb 'begin', and yet one occurrence has the
preverb, whilst the other lacks it, viz.

from the outside'
One might argue from a logical perspective that talk of the beginning of
any action cannot be the appropriate moment to emphasise perfective
aspect for the relevant activity. However, it is clearly the case that
masdars dependent on this verb more often than not will indeed carry their
preverb (cf. from the self-same article:

'X began to burn the mattresses in the cells and to hurl them outside')
If, as we have seen, it is often not possible to predict which preverb
will be employed for a given root or why a switch to another preverb
should result in the precise change of meaning that on this or that occasion
will occur, it is nevertheless true that some preverbs have come to be
associated with a particular nuance which they introduce into the
semantics of a verb-form when they replace the root's normal preverb. It
is now time to look at these interesting nuances.
In addition to the example given in the introductory section of this
chapter for Se- marking the application of the verbal action to only a
slight degree, theGEORGIANDictionary of Morphemes quotes: še-ten-d-a
'dawn broke somewhat' vs ga-ten-d-a 'dawn broke', še-šr-a 'X dried a
little' vs ga-šT-a 'X dried', še-xm-a 'X dried up a little' vs ga-xm-a 'X
dried up', še-c'itl-d-a 'X turned slightly red' vs ga-c'itl-d-a 'X turned
red', še-tvr-a 'X got a bit drunk' vs da-tvr-a 'X got drunk'.
Further examples of the parallel nuance introduced this time by m o from the same Dictionary are: mo-rbil-d-a (= še-rbil-d-a) 'X softened a
bit' vs da-rbil-d-a 'X softened', mo-mc'ar-d-a 'X turned a little bitter'VERBAl MORPHOlOGY163vs ga-mc'ar-d-a 'X turned bitter', mo-mšav-d-a 'X turned a little sour'
vs da-mžav-d-a 'X turned sour'. Also given under the same rubric are
three more denominal verbs, but this time the preverb is followed by the
Subjective Version vowel and the forms in question are restricted (at least
for the relevant meanings) to the Prešent Sub-Series, a restriction that
does not apply to the earlier examples: mo-i-junc'-eb-s 'X is somewhat
mean', mo-i-sust'-eb-s 'X is somewhat weak', mo-i-did-eb-s 'X is
somewhat big', to which can be added mo-i-k'oč'l-eb-s 'X is somewhat
lame'. Note the same initial sequence of morphemes in the (Serially
unrestricted) verbs of the following expressions: tav-s mo-i-k'at , (?+)uneb-s 'X makes him/herself out to be innocent', a synonym of which is
tav-s mo-i-sa+c'q+1-eb-s <= sa+c'q'+al-i 'wretched, miserable'; cf.
tav-s mo-i-m+]in+ar-eb-s 'X pretends to be asleep' <= m + jin + are
'sleeping', tav-s mo-i-m+k'vd+ar-un-eb-s 'X pretends to be dead' <=
m+k'vd+ar-i 'dead'. Keeping this same initial sequence, one can use as
the verbal root the name of a town to produce a verb-form meaning
'find/enjoy TOWN'; such verbs are often used in the past and in questions
of the type: ro+gor mo-(Ø-)i-soxum-e? 'How did you find/enjoy/get on
in Sukhum?', ro+gor mo-(Ø-)i-tbilis-e? 'How did you find/enjoy/get on in
Tbilisi?'.
With some Medial verbs mo- has a special function. Medišis typically
take no preverb in any Series, but the addition of mo- to any of the three
Prešent Sub-Series screeves of the relevant Medišis produces expressions
meaning 'come VERBing' (e.g. (i-)mger-i-s 'X sings' => mo-i-mger-i-s 'X
comes singing', t a m a š - o b - s 'X plays' => m o - t a m a š - o b - s 'X comes
playing', t'ir-i-s 'X cries' => mo-t'ir-i-s 'X comes crying', xox-av-s 'X
crawls' => mo-xox-av-s 'X comes crawling', Ht'v-i-s 'X seeks refuge' =>
mo-i-lt'v-i-s 'X comes seeking refuge'). One can sometimes additionally
indicate the prešence of an indirect object recipient of the verbal activity
(usually the emission of some sort of sound) simply adding a Set B affix (e.g.
q'vir-i-s 'X shouts' => mo-q'vir-i-s 'X comes shouting' => mo-h-q'vir-i-s
'X comes after/follows Y shouting (sc. at Y)', q'iv-i-s 'X crows' => moq'iv-i-s 'X comes crowing' => mo-h-q'iv-i-s 'X comes crowing at Y').
For the root -bed- 'dare' the usual preverb is ga- (as in i+s ro+gor
ga-(Ø-Ø-)bed-e/ga-(Ø-Ø-)m-i-bed-e? 'how did you dare that/dare (do)
that to me?'). If we change the preverb to mo-, we produce a short-hand
way of saying 'dare to come here' (e.g. ro+gor mo-(0-?0-)bed-e? =
mo+svl+a ro+gor ga-(Ø-Ø-)bed-e? 'how did you dare to come here?').
By using še- we produce a short-hand for 'dare to go in', though with an
indirect object attached, the verb means 'dare/deign to do/say something
to someone' (as in:164GEORGIANGRAMMAR

'the woman could not deign to ask anyone to let her spend the night (sc.

'you (will) dare/deign to do/say X/them to Y/them' (cf. the common
expression ro+gor g-e-k'adr-eb-a-t?! 'how can you say/even think of
(saying) such a thing?!').
The preverb mi- is similarly employed with the Prešent Sub-Series
screeves of some Medišis to indicate the opposite orientation (e.g. m i tamaš-ob-s 'X goes playing', mi-k'iv-i-s 'X goes screaming', mi-h-k'ivi-s 'X goes after/follows Y screaming (at Y)').
Consideration of the special functions of da- can begin with the
observation that, where a Medial's activity in the Prešent Sub-Series takes
place not hither or thither but 'all around', then da- is attached (e.g. datamaš-ob-s 'X moves around playing', but in this case when an indirect
object is prešent, the Thematic Suffix alters to give da-s-tama š-eb-s 'X
plays around Y', da-seirn-ob-s 'X walks around', da-k'unt'ruš-ob-s 'X
capers about', da-laklak-ob-s 'X goes around prattling', da-(5'or+aob-s 'X goes around spreading rumours', da-t'rial-eb-s 'X spins around,
works at speed'). When this preverb is used, there is often a hint of its
original directional force 'down' (e.g. da-s-t'rial-eb-s 'X spins/fusses
around/over Y', da-s-t'rp-i-s = da-s-t'rp+ial-eb-s 'X behaves lovingly
over/towards Y', da-h-q'iv-i-s 'X crows down at Y', da-s-t'ir-i-s 'X
looks down and cries over Y', da-gručun-eb-s 'X goes around grunting/X
grunts down over Y', da-h-q'ašq'aš-eb-s 'X (eagle, etc..) barks down at
Y', da-h-q'mu-i-s 'X moos over Y', da-mger-i-s 25 'X sings over Y', which
as a verb with a full paradigm means 'sing to the accompaniment of an
instrument', as shewn by:

da-(?0-)mger-a
PREV-(?3rd.PER-)sing-X(AOR)
'X played the pipe and sang to its accompaniment')
da- may be used in a parallel way with the Prešent Sub-SeriesVERBAl MORPHOlOGY165screeves of non-Medials too (e.g. da-e-tr-ev-a = da-e-xet'-eb-a 'X
wanders aimlessly about', da-a-č'en-eb-s 'X gallops Y (horse) around',
da-a-tr-ev-s 'X drags Y around', da-a-č'rial-eb-s 'X conveys Y (cart)
around creaking', da-a-t'ar-eb-s 'X conveys Y about', da-s-cker-i-s =
da-h-q'ur-eb-s = da-mzer-s 'X looks down upon/over Y', da-i-p'areb-a 'X lurks around like a thief', with which may be compared m o - i p'ar-eb-a 'X comes thieflike' and mi-i-p'ar-eb-a 'X goes thieflike',
though KEGl also quotes a full paradigm for this latter in the šense of
'sneak somewhere').
Perhaps the above-usages of da- might just be subsumed under the
general heading of intensification of the verbal activity, which is often
conveyed by this preverb—an action carried on in more than one direction
might be regarded as an intensification or pluralising of that action.
However, the property of intensification/pluralisation is most clearly seen
when da- substitutes for the normal preverb to underline the plurality of a
Transitive Verb's direct object or an Intransitive Verb's subject. Schmidt
devoted an early article (1957) to this very topic, styling it a South
Caucasian 'Aktionsart'. He quoted a whole list of cases, either elicited or
from KEGl, of da- substituting for other preverbs in cases of plurality
(including instances where the nuance is translateable as 'VERBing to and
from/around' and noting where plurality occasions suppletion of the verbal
root itself), observing that most often da- seems to replace ga- in
Transitive Verbs (e.g. ga-gzavn-i 'you will šend one X' vs da-gzavn-i
'you will šend them', ga-jarcv-av 'you will rob one X' vs da-jarcv-av
'you will rob them', ga-rand-av 'you will plane one X' vs da-rand-av
'you will plane them', ga-bt'q'vn-i 'you will pluck one X' vs da-bt'q'vn-i
'you will pluck them'). Prešented separately were other alternations,
including those for Intransitives (e.g. gada-q'lap'-av 'you will swallow
one X' vs da-q'lap'-av 'you will swallow them', mo-lok'-av = ga-lok'-av
'you will lick one X clean' vs da-lok'-av 'you will lick them clean', m o - h p'ar-av 'you will steal one X from Y' vs da-h-p'ar-av 'you will steal
them from X', mo-k'1-av 'you will kill one X' vs (with change of root!) daxoc-av 'you will kill them', ga-ǰavr-d-eb-a 'X will grow angry' vs daǰavr-d-eb-i-an 'they will grow angry'). Schmidt observed that in addition
to marking the plurality of a direct object, the prešence of da- might
indicate that the verbal activity is applied more than once to the single
object or that the single object ends up in many pieces (e.g. ga-xetk 'you
will split one X' vs da-xetk 'you will split them/one X many times', ga-t'ex
'you will break one X' vs da-t'ex 'you will break them/one X into many
pieces').
gada- may replace a root's normal preverb to indicate that the verbal166GEORGI AN GRAMMARaction is carried out thoroughly or to excess or for a second time, in which
last instance it equates to 're-' (e.g. da-xarǰ-av 'you will spend X/them' =>
gada-xarǰ-av 'you will overspend X/them', da-gl-i 'you will tire X/them'
=> gada-gl-i 'you will overtire X/them', da-a-mlaš-eb 'you will make

'you will change your mind', i-angariš-eb 'you will work out a sum' =>
gada-i-angariå-eb 'you will re-do a sum).
gada- may also indicate the superficiality of the verbal action (e.g
xel-s da-i-ban 'you will wash your hands' => xel-s gada-i-ban 'you will
give your hands a cat-lick', da-a-tval+ier-eb 'you will look over/examine
X/them' => gada-a-tval+ier-eb = tval-s gada-a-vl-eb 'you will give
X/them a cursory inspection').
While not lending any special nuance, the preverb a- is especially
common, though not unique, as the perfectivising exponent for Intransitive
inceptive verbs formed from Medial roots (e.g. i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will
speak' => a-lap'arak'-d-eb-i 'you will begin to speak', i-mger-eb 'you
will sing' => a-mger-d-eb-i 'you will start to sing', i-t'ir-eb 'you will cry'
=> a-t'ir-d-eb-i 'you will start to cry').
The preverb c'a- in combination with the Subjective Version vowel is
especially common with Medial roots to indicate the marginal
accomplishment of the verbal action and will be re-prešented at greater
length in the description of the Medials (e.g. with the Medial i-sauzm-eb
'you will have breakfast' => c'a-i-sauzm-eb 'you will snatch a bit of
breakfast' compare the non-Medial č'am 'you (will) eat X/them' => c'a-ič'am 'you snatch a bite to eat').
c'a- may also serve to indicate that the activity affects the end or
edge of something (e.g. mo-s-č'r-i = mo-a-č'r-i 'you will cut X off Y' =>
c'a-a-č'r-i = c'a-s-č'r-i 'you will cut a small piece X off the end of Y',
mo-s-č'am = mo-a-č'am 'you will eat X off Y' => c'a-s-č'am 'you will eat
top/bottom X off Y', mi-a-b-am 'you will tie X to Y' => c'a-a-b-am 'you
will tie X onto the end of Y thereby extending Y', mi-a-c'eb-eb 'you will
glue X onto Y' => c'a-a-c'eb-eb 'you will glue X onto the end of Y therebyVERBAl MORPHOlOGY167extending Y').
There seems to be a roughness or something uncomplimentary involved
when c'a- replaces ga-mo- in the case of ga-mo-a-rtm-ev 'you will
take X off Y' vs c'a-a-rtm-ev 'you will snatch X off Y'.
The preverb c'a-mo- can also indicate the restricted nature of the
verbal activity (e.g. i-c'vim-eb-s 'it will rain' => c'a-mo-c'vim-s 'there
will be a short rainfall', ga-i-zrd-eb-a 'X will grow' => c'a-mo-i-zrd-eba 'X will grow a bit', k'b+il-i a-g-t'k'iv-d-eb-a 'your tooth will start to
ache' => k'b+il-i c'a-mo-g-t'k'iv-d-eb-a 'your tooth will start to give
you a little pain'). Note, however, c'a-mo-d'arxl-d-eb-i 'you will turn
beetroot red' <= č'arxal-i 'beetroot'.
c'a-mo- is often found with the Subjective Version vowel, especially
with basically Medial roots, indicating the sudden and swift nature of the
activity (e.g. c'a-mo-i-jax-eb 'you will suddenly shout out', i-q'ep-eb-s
'X will bark' => da-i-q'ep-eb-s 'X will give a bark' => c ' a - m o - i - q ' e p eb-s 'X will suddenly let out a bark'). But this nuance is not limited to
Medial derivatives (e.g. da-i-c'q'-eb 'you will begin X/them' vs c'a-moi-c'q'-eb 'you will suddenly begin X/them', a-i-nt-eb-a 'X will light up' vs
c'a-mo-i-nt-eb-a 'X will suddenly light up').
Perhaps the most interesting case of a special nuance attaching to a
preverb concerns š e - m o - (sometimes just še-). This preverb shews that
the verbal action is committed by an unwilling agent (see Potsxishvili 1969;
Dzhorbenadze 1983:96-97), and not only does še-mo- replace the verb's
normal preverb but the active Transitive Verb is made Intransitive
(passive) and the unwilling agent is reprešented as indirect object of this
Intransitive verb-form, sometimes in association with the e-versioniser and
in other cases with the locative Version-vowel depending on the
intransitive morphology characteristic of that root, as will be explained
later in this chapter (e.g. mo-v-k'1-av 'I shall kill X' => š e - m o - m - a k'vd-eb-a 'I shall unwittingly kill X', which Intransitive is based on m o k'vd-eb-a 'X will die' rather than on mo-i-k'vl-eb-a 'X will be killed';
ga-cvet 'you will wear out X/them' => še-mo-g-a-cvd-eb-a = še-mog-e-plit-eb-a = š e - m o - g - e - x - e v - a = š e - m o - g - e - p x r i c ' - e b - a 'you
will unwittingly wear/tear X/them to rags'; da-a-mt'vr-ev 'you will
shatter X/them' => š m o - g - e - m t ' v r - e v - a = še-mo-g-e-msxvr-ev-a =
še-mo-g-e-pšvn-eb-a 'you will unwittingly shatter X/them'; da-xarǰ-av
'you will spend X/them' => še-mo-g-e-xarǰ-eb-a = še-mo-g-e-č'ameb-a 'you will unwittingly spend X/them'; ga-tl-i 'you will whittle X/them'
=> še-mo-g-e-tl-eb-a 'you will unwittingly whittle X/them'; da-č""r-i 'you
will wound X/them' => še-mo-g-e-č'r-eb-a 'you will unwittingly wound X';
ga-lanjg-av 'you will insult X/them' => še-mo-g-e-lanjg-eb-a 'you will168GEORGI AN GRAMMARunwittingly insult X'; ga-t'ex 'you will break X/them' => še-(mo-)g-at'q'd-eb-a 'you will unwittingly break X/them'; ga-lax-av 'you will beat

to'; ga-a-kr-ob 'you will extinguish a light' => åe-mo-g-a-kr-eb-a 'you
will unwittingly extinguish a light').
No mention has yet been made of the alternative forms of some of the
preverbs from the earlier list. In general the variants, each with a
bracketed extra letter, reprešent the older forms of the relevant preverbs.
Occasionally the older form is retained with certain verb-forms, sometimes
both the older and the newer forms will be in use, though there will either
be a difference in meaning or the older form will lend an archaic flavour or
higher style to the form in question.
For ag- we can note that ag+dg+om+a is retained in the šense of
'Easter' whereas the Masdar for 'standing up' today is a-dg-om-a; agk'vec-a indicates 'blessing into the priesthood', whilst a-k'vec-a is today
'shortening (e.g. someone's hair)'; ag+c'er+il+oba is the only word for
'description'. Often forms with the older variant are possible even in the
Prešent Sub-Series (a) for roots never found without this preverb, or (b)
where ag- in the Prešent Sub-Series contrasts with a- elsewhere (e.g. agnišn-av-s 'it means X', ag-ricx-av-s = ag-nusx-av-s 'X enumerates
Y/them', ag-beč'd-av-s 'X leaves behind an imprint of Y', ag-a-gzneb-s = ag-a-nt-eb-s 'X fires/rouses Y/them' vs a-a-gzn-eb-s = a-ant-eb-s 'X will fire/rouse Y/them'). According to the Dictionary of
Morphemes, because of confusion about word-divisions as the older form
was shifting to the newer, the back fricative became attached as part of
the root in a number of cases (such as mi-a-g(+)c'-ev 'you will reach
X/them'—the writer D. K'ldiashvili, who died as late as 1931, used the
original form of the root, as in ra+t'om mi-a-c'-i-a a+m dge-mde?
'why did X survive upto this day?'; in olderGEORGIAN'I confess/
acknowledge' was ag-v-i-a+r-eb, whereas today it is v-a-g(+)i(+)a(+)reb—KEGl has for its entry of 3rd person singular Prešent-Future, Aorist
and Perfect forms: agiarebs, agiara, aguarebia, with the added note in
brackets [and not: agviarebs, ... ugiarebial; V. Topuria and I.
Gigineishvili's 1968 Orthographic Dictionary, on the other hand, gives the
Perfect as: u g i a r e b i a , which can only be analysed as:
(Ø-)ug(+)i(+)a(+)r-eb-i-a, in harmony with the re-interpreted Prešent-Future
form given above).
Similar observations and examples are possible in the case of gan- (e.g.
'hermit' may only be gan+deg+il-i; 'persecution' is gan+d+ev+n+a-, one
way of saying 'X traversed a path' is to say gza ga-(Ø-)i-a+r-a, but with
the alternative root the preverb must be gan-, namely gza gan-(Ø-)vl-o).","[170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187]"

da 'and' is used to conjoin individual words, phrases and also clauses (e.g.
šen da me 'you(SG) and I'; deda da mama 'mother and father';
u+pr+o+s-i jma da u+mcr+o+s-i da 'older brother and younger sister').
When the cases in which the conjoined nouns stand have long and short
forms, the conjunct that stands immediately before the da will take the
long form (e.g. (kart+v+el-eb-is,) m+egr+el-eb-isa da svan-eb-is
si+amaq'+e (GEORGIAN-Pl-GEN)Mingrelian-Pl-GEN and Svan-Pl-GEN
pride(NOM) 'the pride of (GEORGIANs,)Mingrelians and Svans'). Where
more than one noun is dependent on a postposition, the postposition usually
occurs just once at the end of the sequence, the first of a pair of such
conjoined dependent nouns standing in the long form of the relevant case
(e.g. sa+prang+et-sa da inglis-s šua France-DAT and England-DAT
between 'between France and England'). Where two adjectives are
conjoined, the first might take on the (long) case marking of its head-noun
rather than shew the simple concord-relation (e.g. k'bil+is+mier-isa da
nun+is+mier-i tan+xm+ovn-eb-is c'in dental-GEN and palatal-AGR
consonant-Pl-GEN before 'in front of dental and palatal consonants').
5.1.6.2 Disjunction
The simple equivalent of '(either...) or' is (an...) an, and this is true for
disjunctive conjunction of words, phrases or clauses (e.g. an si+k'vd+il-i
an ga+marjv+eb+a 'either death or victory'). When an is translateable
by 'or', it may take the ancient form anu (e.g. cocxal-i anu m+k'vd+ar-i
'alive or dead'), which latter is often found when in English we would have
'or rather/or, if you prefer/or, as some say, etc.', e.g.

5.1.7 The Verb Phrase
The interplay of case-marking and pronominal cross-referencing on the
verb is now illustrated for the different classes of verb. The two sets of
agreement-affixes presented in Chapter 4 and 5.Ø.1 are repeated below:549SYNTAXSet AAgreement-affixes1st person

(with Set A agreement), their direct objects to stand in the Dative (with Set
B agreement), and their indirect objects to stand in the Dative (with Set B
agreement) if the relevant screeve belongs to Series I; (b) their subjects to
stand in the Ergative (with Set A agreement), their direct objects to stand
in the Nominative (with Set B agreement), and their indirect objects to
stand in the Dative (with Set B agreement) if the relevant screeve belongs
to Series II; (c) their subjects to stand in the Dative (with Set B
agreement), their direct objects to stand in the Nominative (with Set A
agreement), and their indirect objects to become the Genitive postpositional
object of - t v i s 'for' (with no agreement on the verb) if the relevant
screeve belongs to Series III, e.g.

Some Transitive verbs have lost their original direct objects and are
thus construed with only one external NP (viz. the subject). Despite this,55ØGEORGIANGRAMMARthat subject requires the same c a š m a r k i n g and verb-agreement as a
'normal' transitive subject, e.g.
k'at'a-m
mo-(?Ø-)šard-a
cat-ERGA PREV-(?itB-)urinate-itA(AOR)
'the cat urinated'

answer-NOM
not PREV-I-(it-)NV-delay-I NDIC(AOR)
'I did not delay the answer'
Other Transitive verbs, though having lost their original direct object,
are stIII bivalent by virtue of taking an indirect object; 'hit' falls into this
category, e.g.
m+c'vrtn+el-ma
lom-s
trainer-ERGA
lion-DATB
'the trainer hit the lion'(?Ø-)s-cem-a
(?itB-)itB-hit-heA(AOR)However, colloquially there is a tendency to normalise this verb by
treating the indirect object as the direct object and to c a š m a r k it
accordingly (viz. m+c'vrtn+el-ma lom-i (Ø-)?s-cem-a). A number of
what today are regular transitive verbs with subject and direct object were
in OldGEORGIANof the unregularised 'hit'-type (see Footnote 3 of Chapter
4).
The Objective Version vowels serve to create indirect objects, cf.

However, the verb ga-šv-eb-a 'let go' is unusual insofar as it always
incorporates the Objective Version in the first two screeve-Series, and yet
the entity which determines the person and shape of the object-agreement
plus version-vowel within the verb is now interpreted as the direct object,
as may be seen from the Nominative case of this argument in Series II, e.g.
q'araul-ma t'usag-i
ga-(?Ø-Ø-)u-šv-a

Exactly the same pattern of c a š m a r k i n g and verb-agreement as is
found with Transitive verbs is also manifested by the so-called Medial
verbs, which usually occur with only one external NP (viz. the subject), e.g.
m+tvr+al-i

(Ø-)i-tamaš-eb-s

To IIIustrate a Medial with indirect object (but without a direct object
external to the verb) we take the verb 'guard', e.g.
saxl-s
vin

Intransitive verbs take Nominative subjects (with Set A agreement) and
Dative indirect objects (with Set B agreement) in all three screeve-Series,
e.g.
xunj-eb-s
ra
da-(Ø-)e-mart-eb-a-t

IIIogical as it may seem, a few Intransitive verbs can be construed with
two indirect objects, both of which remain in the Dative across the three
Series, e.g.
(i+s)
(šen)
gul-is
c'ad + il-s

In speech the syntax of such verbs is often remodelled, for obvious
reasons, by analogy with that of Transitives, especially in Series II, so that
instead of the prescriptively 'correct':

which makes the analysis of the d-exponent in the verb rather problematic!
Straightforward bivalent Intransitives are sometimes treated transitively by
virtue of being assigned an Ergative subject for their Series II screeves,
e.g.

In the Prešent Sub-Series the verb for 'tell/say X to Y' is
morphologically Intransitive and yet is construed with two Dative NPs, e.g.
deda
bavšv-s
t'q'u+il-s
mother(NOM) child-DAT lie-DAT
The mother is telling the child a lie'(Ø-Ø-)e-ubn-eb-a
(it-him-)IOV-tell-TS-she(PRES)554GEORGIANGRAMMARThough the root of this verb is suppletive in the Future Sub-Series, the
same applies, e.g.
deda bavšv-s t'q'u+il-s(Ø-Ø-)e-rq'v-i-s
tell-PASS-she(FuT)However, suppletion again occurs in both Series II and Series III, but
in both instances a transitive root is employed, so that it becomes clear
from c a š m a r k i n g that here we are dealing with fully-fledged direct vs
indirect objects, e.g.

explanation.
An opposite type of IIIogicality is where the morphology of an
Intransitive verb points to the prešence of a Dative indirect object, and
yet the second NP in the clause is governed by a postposition and thus
cannot be dependent on the verb. This syntactic monovalence is often
given morphological recognition in III rd Series' forms, which are monopersonal rather than bi-personal in structure, e.g.

The magpie would regularly mix in with the chickens'xolme

5.1.8 Causatives
5.1.8.1 Synthetic Causatives
5.1.8.1.1 Intransitive Verbs
When an intransitive verb is made causative, the subject of the embedded
Intransitive Verb becomes direct object of the matrix causative. To shew
this clearly all examples will be given in the Aorist tense, e.g.

5.1.8.1.2 Transitive Verbs
When a Transitive Verb is made causative, the subject of the embedded
Transitive Verb becomes indirect object of the matrix causative, whilst the
embedded direct object remains unchanged, e.g.","[565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576]"

'I kill/shall kill/killed you Pl.', where the pluraliser is part of the 2nd person
exponent from Set B, or (ii) 'we kill/shall kill/killed you', where the
pluraliser is part of the 1st person exponent from Set A, or (iii) 'we
kill/shall kill/killed you Pl"", where an expected final sequence of -t-t has
been simplified by loss of one of the dentals but it is unclear which one—in
the Prešent and Future the forms here may have as a fourth reading the
one given earlier, namely 'X kills/will kill you Pl', which arises out of the
loss of - s - from Set A when followed by -t.
There are no problems with combinations of 2nd person subject and 1st

person plural allomorphs -(a/e)n/es/nen of Set A, the forms in the last133VERBAl MORPHOlOGYrow quoted are ambiguous as the 2nd person direct object could be either
singular or plural.
This brings us to the marking of indirect objects. The Set B affixes are
again employed, except that now the alternative allomorphs for the 3rd
person come into play according to the rule prešented in 2.2.7, namely: the
base- (=historically oldest) morph h- assimilates to s- when immediately
followed by any of -c, -c', - j , -č, -č', - j , -t, -t', -d, being retained as
h - before -k, -k', -g, -q', - p ' 1 3 ; before other consonants or a vowel the
zero-allophone is used. However, if until around the 2nd World War the
allophones s-, h- were still possible between 1st person subject-marker vand the root-initial consonant (e.g. mi-v-s-c'er 'I shall write to X/them',
v-h-q'v-eb-i 'I follow X/them'), today this is in general no longer true, so
that these examples would now be rendered respectively as: mi-v-c'er,
v-q'v-eb-i. Examples are from the Future Indicative forms of the
Transitive verb 'write to' and of the Intransitive verb 'follow':

between (i) 'I'll follow you Pl', (ii) 'we'll follow you', and (iii) 'we'll follow you
Pl'.
We have not yet discussed the bracketed 3rd person pluraliser from
Set B or what happens with transitive verbs when both direct and indirect
object would require a non-zero pronominal prefix within the verbal
complex, a couplingGEORGIANseems to prefer to avoid. As regards the
pluraliser, prescriptive rules require that Transitive Verbs simply never
mark the plurality of a 3rd person indirect object, which is why all forms
given above for 'write to' with 3rd person indirect object were glossed as
'to X/them'. I have come across only two examples where the plurality of a
3rd person indirect object is marked with this -t on a transitive verb; the
first is from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo (29 March 1991, p.2):

PREV-PREV-(it-)portray-AOR.SUBJ-they

'the voices too to which age does not give the means to express their
wish...'
where one would have expected (Ø-Ø-)a-jl-ev-s. The second is from
Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's lord of Rach'a. The verb is one of those which are
Transitive but lack a direct object, their second argument being the
indirect object, viz.
m+sm+en+el-eb-s
listener-Pl-DATžriant'el-ma
shudder-ERGda-(?Ø-Ø-)u-ar-a-t
PREV-(?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)OV-run.
through-it(AOR)-Pl'a shudder ran through the audience'
However, if the verb is a bipersonal intransitive, it is indeed possible to
mark the plurality of the 3rd person indirect object as long as the subject
of the verb is 3rd person singular, so that 'X will follow them' could be
either mi-h-q'v-eb-a or mi-h-q'v-eb-a-t. An attested example of this
feature with this very root, though with a different preverb, comes from
the text of Ivane Imnaishvili's 1971 Historical Chrestomathy of the
GEORGIANlanguage (vol 1. part 2) (p.344):VERBAl MORPHOlOGY135zog+jer

'From their own root only the Prešent Indicative (etc..) are formed for

pluraliser, a consideration of these examples reveals that it cannot simply
be the prešence vs abšence of the plural indirect object in the clause, or
whether the plural indirect object precedes or follows its verb.
More will be said when describing the formation of Series 111 for
Transitive and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general about the use
with them of the two sets of pronominal affixes, but it is appropriate to
note at this point that, since with these forms the Dative nominal functions
as subject and the Nominative as direct object, the Set B affixes reprešent
the subject, whilst the Set A affixes correlate with the direct object. As
plural 3rd person human subjects impose their plurality on the verb, in
these instances the plurality of the Dative nominal will always be marked
on the verb by the suffixal -t if the Dative noun is human and if the direct
object is 3rd person (N.B. the plurality of the Nominative nominal is just
ignored as far as verbal agreement is concerned), e.g.

child-Pl-NOMThis suggests that during the course of its historyGEORGIANhas shifted
subject-status from the Nominative to the Dative nominal for these verbforms. There are two interesting illustrations in KEGl of what is
manifestly a bivalent Intransitive verb, namely 'be born to'. The first
comes from the great 19th century writer Ilia t'avč'avadze:
si+t'q'v+a-n-i
gul-ši
m-e-bad-eb-i-an
word-Pl-NOM
heart-in
me-I OV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-Pl
'Words/Speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'
where the old plural of the (non-human) subject imposes its plurality on the
verb 16 . This contrasts with the following from Ch'avch'avadze's equally
great contemporary, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli:
šv+il-eb-i
child-Pl-NOM(Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t
(3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-Srd.PER-PlVERBAl MORPHOlOGY139'Children are born to them'
where the human Nominative subject imposes no plurality on the verb,
being indicated by the Set A singular suffix -a-, whilst the Dative indirect
object has its plurality shewn by -t, just as if this were an Indirect verb,
which it palpably is not 17 . Thus, one cannot take the mere prešence of this
pluraliser with a 3rd person entity as an indicator that the 3rd person
entity in question is viewed as the subject of the verb-form.
As already stated, this pluraliser for a 3rd person Dative nominal
should, according to prescriptivists, be found only when the Nominative
nominal is itself 3rd person. Once again, however, one does come across
instances where the pluraliser appears with 1st or 2nd person Nominative
nominals. Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's autobiography furnishes the examples:

How, then, doesGEORGIANavoid having two non-zero Set B affixes
within a single verbal complex, as one would expect in the translation of
clauses like 'they give you to me'?GEORGIANavoids the difficulty by
paraphrasing one of the nominals as a 3rd person NP, which, of course,
takes a zero as its coreferential affix in the verb. The phrase in question
consists of the appropriate case of the noun tav-i 'head; self' preceded by
the possessive adjective of the paraphrased pronoun. This periphrasis then
substitutes for the direct object pronoun, e.g.
šen-i
m+s'+ob+l-eb-i

This periphrasis will even be used where the indirect object is 3rd
person, asGEORGIANseems to have a preference for interpreting a 1st or
2nd person pronominal prefix on a trivalent verb as the marker of indirect
rather than direct objecthood, e.g.
čem-i
m+š+ob+l-eb-i čem-s tav-s

my-AGR parent-Pl-NOM my-AGR head-DAT teacher-DAT
(Ø-Ø-)a-bar-eb-en
(3rd.PER-her-)lV-entrust-TS-they(PRES)
'my parents are entrusting me/handing me over to the teacher'
However, where the context makes it clear which nominal is the direct
and which the indirect object, this rule may be ignored—for instance, if I
am the child, it is unlikely that my parents would be entrusting the teacher
to me, and so one might hear in place of the above čem-i m+š+ob+1-eb-i
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en, even if prescriptively this
sequence should be interpreted as though the verb were to be analysed
(Ø-)m-a-bar-eb-en with the šense 'they are entrusting X/them to me'.
KEGl provides an example of the verb 'introduce X to Y' with the
periphrastic rule observed, viz.","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"
"SYNTAX591where either the SUBJect-pronoun šen or the locative adverb a+k are
suitable insertions to protect the clitic rom from claušinitial position. The
non-finite method of expressing the basic temporal notion is to use the
Masdar of the subordinate verb. It stands in the Genitive case, being
dependent upon dro-s, Dative of the noun dro 'time', e.g.
tv+it+m+pr+in+av-ši š s v l - i s

xolme
churn-TS-MASD(NOM) me-IOV-begin-TS-it
generally
'When entering a plane I start to feel nauseous as a rule'
The Masdar plus dro-s may be fused to produce the Dative of the
Genitive base within the Masdar alone (i.e. š s v l - i s a - s ) .
5.2.2.1.7.2 'as soon as'
Two finite reprešentations exist. The first places the words ro+gor+c k'i
'as soon as' at the start of the indicative subordinate clause, which may
either precede or follow the main clause, e.g.
ro+gor+c k'i
šen-i
c'er+il-i
mo-m-i-va,
as.soon.as
you-AGR letter-NOM PREV-me-OV-come(.it.FuT)
ma-s
c'a-v-(Ø-)i-k'itx-av
it-DAT PREV-I -(it-)SV-read-TS(FuT)
'As soon as your letter reaches me, I shall read it'
The second strategy is based on the formation of alternative questions
and places the words tu ara 'or not' immediately after the subordinate
verb; a peculiarity of this strategy is that the subordinate clause must
precede the main clause, so that the first clause in the last example may be
recast to give either:
šen-i c'er+il-i mo-m-i-va tu ara,...
or mo-m-i-va tu ara šen-i c'er+il-i,...
The non-finite alternative consists of the postposition -tana+ve 'at the
very moment' governing the Genitive of the Masdar of the subordinate
verb, so that a further variant of the first clause above would be:592GEORGIANGRAMMARšen-i

'After you went out, the teacher fainted'
The allied notion of 'since + Past Tense Verb' is conveyed by the same
construction, though the postposition še+m+deg may be replaced by
uk'an 'behind' or by a+k+et 'on this side, over here', whilst the first two
words of the pseudo-conjunctional complex may yield to the phrase i+m
dro-i+dan 'from that time', e.g.
i+m dro-i+dan, ra+c

'Since the time you left me 1 have been going around like a ghost'
The English concatenation of 'since' with the Progressive Perfect is
rendered simply by the use of ra+c, which is optionally omissible, with the
Prešent Indicative, e.g.

Where the action of the subordinate verb is one that is amenable to
repetition, a negative may optionally be introduced into such temporal
subordinate clauses, e.g.

5.2.2.l7A 'while, until, before'
These concepts are conveyed by a choice between the two conjunctions
sa+na+m(de) and vi+d+re(+mde) (older variants being sa+na+mdis/
vi+d+re+mdis), both of which roughly mean 'upto where/which point', such
that the different temporal notions are reflected in the varying syntax of
the clauses themselves.
5.2.2.1.7.4.1 'while'
If the verb is of continuous aspect, the šense must be that of 'while', e.g.
sa+na+m sa+q'var+el gada+c+em+a-sv-(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'ur-eb-di-t,

'While we were watching our favourite programme, someone knocked
on the door'
5.22.1.7.4.2'until'
The prešence of a negative in the main clause motivates the introduction
of one in the subordinate clause too, e.g.
ar mo-g-šor-d-eb-i,
vi+d+re+mdis

the ground'
Here both clauses contain the Future Indicative. If the main clause is
a prohibition, the subordinate clause may contain the negated Future
Indicative, Aorist Indicative, Aorist SUBJunctive or even the Perfect, e.g.","[609, 610, 611, 612]"
"358GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.7.3.5 Medial Verbs with Indirect Object (Relative Medials)
Indirect objects with Medials are marked in a variety of ways.
In some cases the Objective Version may be used in the expected way
to create an indirect object for the verb. For some verbs this is only
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. Examples: sisxl-i g-i-dug-s 'your
blood is boiling'; mgel-s k'b+il-eb-i cecxl-i-vit
(Ø-)u-el-av-s/(Ø-)uel+v+ar-eb-s 'the wolfs teeth flash like fire'; mtel-i sxeul-i m-i-špotav-s, m-i-trt-i-s = m-i-trt+ol-av-s = m-i-k'ank'al-eb-s = m - i caxcax-eb-s = m-i-)agjag-eb-s 'my whole body is roused, is shaking',
or with a different šense si+garib+e-s ar v-(Ø-)u-trt-i(-v-a+r) 'I do
not quake before poverty' (cf. jar-i ar (Ø-)u-prtx-i-s 99
si+cx+e-s 'the
army is not afraid of the heat'). Where the Thematic Suffix is -eb in both
Prešent and Future Sub-Series, such forms in Objective Version may be
ambiguous between Prešent of the basic Medial and Future of the
(pseudo-)Causative. And so, if we take the Future of trt-i-s, we get
(?Ø-)i-trt+ol-eb, which gives the (pseudo-)Causative
(Ø-)a-trt+ol-eb-s
'X makes (will make) Y/them tremble', which in Objective Version is (ØØ-)u-trt+ol-eb-s 'X (will) make Y/them tremble for Z/them', and this is
given in KEGl with the glosses
(Ø-Ø-)u-caxcax-eb-s/(Ø-Ø-)uk'ank'al-eb-s (and we could add (Ø-Ø-)u-)agjag-eb-s)), even though
surprisingly these verb-forms under their own entries are only glossed in
KEGl itself as though they were restricted to functioning as synonyms of
(Ø-)u-trt-i-s.
However, for other verbs the Objective Version is
acceptable throughout Series I and 11 (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)u-q'vir-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)uq'vir-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'vir-e/g-i-q'vir-(n-)i-?a m-is-tvis 'you shout/
will shout/ shouted/ have shouted at X';
(Ø-Ø-)u-mger(-i)/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)umger-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-mger-e/g-i-mger-(n-)i-?a m-is-tvis 'you sing/
will sing/sang/have sung to X'; ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-rb-i-x-a+r/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)
u-rb-en/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-rb-in-e/ga-g-i-rb-en-i-a m-is-gan 'you
run/will run/ran/have run away from X').
Sometimes the indirect object along with its agreement-prefix is simply
added to the basic Medial in the Prešent Sub-Series (e.g. (Ø-)p'asux-ob
'you give an answer' vs (Ø-)h-p'asux-ob 'you answer X/them' 1 Ø Ø ;
(Ø-)q'araul-ob = (Ø-)daraj-ob = q'araul-ada x-a+r 'you are on guard'
vs (Ø-)h-q'araul-ob = (Ø-)s-daraj-ob 'you guard X/them'). However, in
the Future Sub-Series and in Series 11 the Objective Version has to be
used when the indirect object is prešent (e.g. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-p'asux-eb/(Ø?Ø-Ø-)u-p'asux-e 'you will answer/ answered X/them'; (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)uq'araul-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'araul-e = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-daraj-eb/(Ø-?ØØ-)u-daraj-e 'you will guard/guarded X/them'); (Ø-Ø-)h-k'arnaxo b / ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) u - k ' a r n a x - e b ) 'you (will) direct X/themI O in theVERBAl MORPHOlOGY359writing/thinking of Y/themDO' behaves the same way. In Series III the
basic Medial formation is used and the underlying indirect object surfaces
as the postpositional object of - t v i s (e.g. sa+gare+o
sa+km+e-ta
minist'r-s (Ø-)u-p'asux-(n-)i-?a šen-tvis 'the Foreign Minister has
answered you').
In the case of (Ø-Ø-)švel-i 'you aid X/them' (Imperfect (Ø-Ø-)švelod-i) the verb cannot be used without an indirect object, and although in
the Future Sub-Series and Series 11 the Objective Version is employed, the
usual Thematic Suffix -eb does not substitute for -i, giving the Future (Ø?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-i 'you will help X/them' (for which Vogt quotes the
Conditional (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-Svel-i-d-i)—N.B. 'help!' is (Ø-?Ø-)m-i-švel-el.
For 'offer' the Future does substitute -eb but additionally takes the
preverb š ( m o - ) (viz. (Ø-Ø-)s-tavaz-ob 'you offer X/them to Y/them' =>
Future še-(mo-}(Ø-Ø-)s-tavaz-eb); in the Perfect this Thematic Suffix is
retained, giving še-(mo-)g-i-tavaz-eb-i-a
-tvis, Pluperfect š e (mo-)g-e-tavaz-eb-in-a -tvis.
For 'laugh at, mock' the endings in all Series are the same as for the
basic Medial (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-i 'you laugh' (Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb =>
Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-e => Perfect g-i-cin-i-?a), but in the Future SubSeries and in Series 11 the indirect object prefix takes the place of the iversioniser and in addition the preverb da- is always prešent, giving da(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-i/da-(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-eb 'you (will) mock X/them'. This
contrasts with the Objective Version coupled to the basic Medial (Ø-Ø-)ucin-i/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cin-eb 'you (will) look at X/them and laugh' 1Ø1
(Perfect ga-g-i-cin-i-?a -tvis), which has the synonym še-(mo-)(Ø-)scin-i/še-(mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-eb (Perfect še-(mo-)g-i-cin-eb-i-?a
-tvis); cf. the semelfactives ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will break into a
laugh' (Perfect ga-g-i-cin-i-?a), ča-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will laugh
quietly to yourself' vs ča-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cin-eb 'you will laugh quietly to
X/them' (Perfect ša-g-i-cin-i-?a -tvis). The formally bipersonal (but
monovalent) prefixal Intransitive Verb-form (ga-)g-e-cin-eb-?a is, of
course, an Indirect Verb (see 4.7.4) with the 2nd person addressee here the
(unintentional) laugher as the verb-form means 'you (will) break out into a
laugh' (=> Aorist ga-g-e-cin-?a => Perfect ga-g-cin-eb-i-?a).
[It might be thought that 'smile' would behave the same way as 'laugh',
but this is not so. KEGl recognises no verb-form of the type *(Ø-)gimi / ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - g i m - e b , quoting g i m - i as an alternative to the
Masdar/abstract-noun gim+il-i; and Tschenkčli's Dictionary quotes such a
Prešent Indicative as (Ø-)gim-i only as a theoretical construct on the
basis of the form (Ø-Ø-)u-gim-i with Objective Version, given below.
(ga-)(Ø-)i-gim-eb-i is a normal Intransitive Verb 'you (will) smile' (Aorist36ØGEORGIANGRAMMARga-(Ø-)i-gim-e => Perfect ga-(Ø-)gim-eb-ul-x-a+r, though there is an
alternative inverted Series III set of screeves with Perfect ga-g-i-gim-i?a, which does give the verb some affinity with the Medial class). For 'you
smile at X/them' we have a choice of (Ø-Ø-)u-gim-i 102 (Imperfect (ØØ-)u-gim-od-i) or (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-gim-eb => the Future ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)ugim-eb => Aorist ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-gim-e => Perfect ga-g-i-gim-i-?a
-tvis. Note the alternative semantic relationship between the arguments
for (Ø-Ø-)u-gim-i in the Prešent Sub-Series only as seen in čfem-s
m+š+ob+1-eb-s p'ir-i (Ø-)u-gim-i-t 'my parents' face(s) break into a
little smile'; cf. g-e-gim-eb-?a 'you break into a reluctant smile', which
form is regular for a prefixal bipersonal Intransitive in terms of its
morpho-syntax with Future ga-g-e-gim-eb-?a => Aorist ga-g-e-gim-?a
=> Perfect ga-g-g im-eb-i-a. The form da-(Ø-Ø-)gim-i 'you look
smilingly down upon X/them' is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series and
should be compared with a group of similar verb-forms prešented under
'see' in 4.1Ø. However, the parallels še-(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)gim-i 'you look
thither (hither) smilingly at X/them' have a full set of screeves across the
paradigms with Future še-(mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)gim-eb => Aorist še-(mo-)(Ø?Ø-Ø-)gim-e => Perfect še-(mo-)g-i-gim-eb-i-?a -tvis.]
The verb for 'shout' is (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-i (Imperfect (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-di/(Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-od-i) => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-e => Perfect g-i-)ax-(n-)i?a, which also serves for the abšent Future Sub-Series, for the anticipated
Medial Future (Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-eb is actually the formal Prešent 'you
summon/call out X/them', used with a variety of preverbs but especially
ga-mo-, as in the expression ekim-s ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-eb 'you will
call out the doctor' (Aorist ekim-i ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-e, Perfect ekim-i
ga-mo-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a/ga-mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a), which does not differ
in meaning from ekim-s ga-mo-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-eb (Aorist ekim-s gamo-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-e, Perfect ekim-is-tvis ga-mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-?a).
With Objective Version attached to the basic Medial we have (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)ujax-i (Imperfect (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-d-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-od-i), which
means either 'you (will) shout to X/them' or analysed as (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-i
'you (will) give the name X to Y/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-e => Perfect
g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis), in which latter šense (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-c'od-eb 1 0 3
is a
synonym; in the Prešent Sub-Series only (Ø-(?)Ø-Ø-)e-)ax-i (Imperfect
(Ø-(?)Ø-Ø-)e-)ax-(o)d-i) is also a synonym for both usages. As a
semelfactive in the perfective screeves there is da-(Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-eb 'you
will shout out (something)' (Perfect da-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a) and in Objective
Version da-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-eb 'you will shout out (something) to X/them'
(Perfect da-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis). da-(Ø-(Ø-))s-]ax-i is limited to the
Prešent Sub-Series and means 'shout down (something) to X/them'. še-(Ø-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY361(Ø-))s-]ax-i means 'you shout (something) at X/them' with the Future še(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb (Perfect še-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis), though KEGl also
quotes, interestingly without any indirect object affix indicated, š ( Ø ?Ø-)jax-eb 'you will shout out in excitement' (Perfect še-g-i-)ax-(n-)i?a). With preverb š e - m o - only še-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb is quoted in
KEGl but with two meanings and two partly differentiated paradigms: in
the šense 'you will start to sing out song X' the Perfect is še-mo-g-i-)ax(n-)i-a, whilst in the šense of 'you will address (some words) loudly to a
by-stander Y' the Perfect is š m o - g - i - ) a x - e b - i - a -tvis). For ča-(ØØ-)s-]ax-i/ša-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb 'you (will shout something down into at
X/them' the Perfect is given as ča-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis, whereas for a(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb 'you will shout something up to X/them' only non-Prešent
Sub-Series forms are given (Perfect a-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis). mo-(Ø?Ø-)s-)ax-i is glossed as 'you sound a reply to X/them' or 'you follow
someone coming in this direction shouting at them' whilst mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-)axeb (Perfect mo-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis) is said to be a synonym for the
locative Versional mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb (Perfect mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a
-tvis) 'you will suddenly hurl a loud verbal message hither at X/them' 104;
and mi-(Ø-?Ø-)s-)ax-i is 'you follow someone going somewhere else
shouting at them', with mi-(Ø-Ø-)s-]ax-eb (Perfect mi-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a
-tvis) said to be a synonym for the locative Versional mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)ajax-eb (Perfect mi-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis) 'you will suddenly hurl a loud
verbal message thither at X/them'105.
The pattern just illustrated with preverbs m o - / m i - combining with the
locative Version is found with a number of other verbs to indicate
suddenly shouting at someone with the particular voice-quality of the
verbal root. Examples: mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you will suddenly
yell something at X/them' (Perfect mo-/mi-g-i-q'vir-eb-i-a -tvis); m o /mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'iv+l-eb 'you will suddenly crow something at X/them'
(Perfect mo-/mi-g-i-q'iv+l-eb-i-a -tvis); mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'ir-eb
'you will suddenly tearfully shout something at X/them' (Perfect mo-/mi-gi-t'ir-eb-i-a -tvis);mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-čxav+l-eb1Ø6
'you will suddenly
screech/mew something at X/them' (Perfect mi-g-i-čxav+1-eb-i-a
-tvis). For the corresponding forms of 'bark' KEGl quotes only mi-(?ØØ-)a-q'ep-s '(dog) will bark at X/them' as a synonym for da-/še-(?ØØ-)u-q'ep-s; the form also differs structurally from those just listed
insofar as it has the Perfect mi-(Ø-)u-q'ep-(?n-)i-?a -tvis.
Sometimes the e-versioniser is employed, and the verb-form has the
morpho-syntactic patterning in Series 1 and 11 of a bipersonal prefixal
Intransitive (which is to say that the subject in Series II stands in the
Nominative); in these cases there is often no formal difference between362GEORGl AN GRAMMARPrešent and Future Sub-Series. When there is no preverb associated with
this formation, Series 111 departs from the morpho-syntax of an
Intransitive Verbs and simply takes the basic Medial (inverted) verb-form,
making the indirect object dependent on a suitable postposition. With two
such verbs there is a formal difference between Prešent and Future SubSeries: from
(Ø-)i-brjv-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-brj+ol-eb
'you (will) fight' we have
(Ø-Ø-)e-brjv-i 'you fight X/them' => Future (Ø-Ø-)e-brj+ol-eb-i =>
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-brj+ol-e => Perfect g-i-brj+ol-(n-)i-?a -tan; but from
(Ø-(Ø-))i-svr-i/(Ø-Ø-)i-sr+ol-eb 'you (will) shoot (X/them)' we have (Ø(Ø-)Ø-)e-svr-i 'you (will) shoot (X/them) at Y/them', which then gives the
Aorist (Ø-(Ø-)Ø-)e-sr+ol-e, which, though formally the expected shape,
is treated as a Transitive Verb with Ergative subject and 3rd person plural
marked by -es (rather than the anticipated -nen); the Perfect is g-i-svri-a/g-i-sr+ol-(?n-)i-a -tvis. Further examples: (Ø-Ø-)e-čurčul-eb-i
'you (will) whisper/talk in whispers to X/them' => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-čurčul-e
=> Perfect g-i-čurčul-(n-)i-a -tvis-, (Ø-Ø-)e-(5ipc?ip-eb-i 'you (will)
talk with a lisp to X/them' (no Series III); (Ø-Ø-)e-k'amat-eb-i 'you (will)
argue with X/them' => Perfect g-i-k'amat-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-čxubeb-i => Perfect g-i-čxub-(?n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i 'you
(will) speak with X/them' => Perfect g-i-lap'arak'-(n-)i-?a -tan; (ØØ-)e-musaip-eb-i = (Ø-Ø-)e-sa+ub+r-eb-i = (Ø-Ø-)e-maslaat-eb-i
= (Ø-Ø-)e-baas-eb-i 'you (will) converse with X/them' => Perfect g-imusaip-(n-)i-?a (etc..) -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i 'you (will) play with
X/them' => g-i-tamaš-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-aršiq'-eb-i 'you (will) flirt
with X/them' => g-i-aräiq'-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-xumr-eb-i 'you (will)
joke with X/them' => Perfect g-i-xumr-(?n-)i-?a -tan.
Some of these bipersonal Intransitive derivatives may also permit a
preverb to be used in the perfective screeves, the meaning of which seems
to be little more than an inceptive (plus an indirect object). The morphosyntax of these forms is entirely regular across the three Series, such that
in Series III they remain faithful to the bipersonal Intransitive paradigm
taking their subject in the Nominative and forming the screeves on a
notional Masdar-stem that incorporates the Thematic Suffix -eb (as noted
in Hewitt 1987a.335-336; and as discussed by Tuite 1993). Examples: da(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i
= ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i = g a - m o (Ø-Ø-)e-sa+ub+r-eb-i
'you will engage X/them in conversation' =>
Perfect da-(Ø-Ø-)lap'arak'-eb-i-x+ar = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)lap'arak'-ebi-x+ar = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)sa+ub+r-eb-i-x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i
'you will start to play with X/them' => Perfect ga-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-ix+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-aršiq'-eb-i 'you will start to flirt with X/them' =>
Perfect ga-(Ø-Ø-)aršiq'-eb-i-x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-xumr-eb-i 'you willVERBAl MORPHOlOGY363say something jokingly to X/them; you will start to joke with X/them' =>
Perfect ga(Ø-Ø-)xumr-eb-i-x-a+r; š(Ø-Ø-)e-k'amat-eb-i 'you will
take issue with X/them' => Perfect še-lØ-)h-k'amat-eb-i-x-a+r.
Occasionally the preverbal form changes from an Intransitive to
Transitive Verb-form with indirect object, so that if a person will start a
conversation with someone at his side, this may be expressed literally,
using one of the Intransitive Verb-forms just prešented, as: gverd-it
m+q'+op-s ga-mo-(Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-a; alternatively the Transitive
form (i+s) gada-(?Ø-Ø-}u-lap'arak'-eb-s (Aorist (man) gada-(?ØØ-)u-lap'arak'-a, Perfect (ma-s) gada-(Ø-)u-lap'arak'-eb-i-?a 107
ma-s-tan) encapsulates this notion entirely within itself; if the speaking to
one's neighbour is soft, then (5a-(?Ø-Ø-)u-lap,arak,-eb-s is used, which,
according to KEGl, contrasts with the bipersonal Intransitive with this
preverb, namely ča-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i, for which the meaning is
'you will talk down to X/them' (e.g. of a person to a dog). Another such
Transitive is ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-tamaš-eb 'you will skirt X/them playing;
you will start to play with X/them' (Perfect ga-g-i-tamaš-eb-i-?a -tan),
where, however, we have an alternative Intransitive, but this time it is the
inceptive suffixal Intransitive in Objective Version (viz. ga-(Ø-Ø-)utamaš-d-eb-i => Perfect ga-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-x-a+r)!","[376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382]"

'you are in the grip of a yearning for X/them',
which is limited to the Prešent Sub-Series.
The verb in -il-ob is exceptional according to the standards of the
pattern just examined. It is (Ø-Ø-)cd-il-ob 'you try (to do something)',
which in the Future Sub-Series and in Series II becomes the bivalent
prefixal Intransitive Verb (še-)(Ø-Ø-)e-cd-eb-i vs Aorist (še-)(Ø-Ø-)ecad-e, where we note the optionality of the preverb, (e.g. gogo (še-)
(Ø-)e-cad-a tval-eb-i ga-(Ø-)e-xil-a 'the girl tried to open her eyes').
Alongside this Intransitive Aorist we also find the Transitive (Ø-Ø-)?scad-e (e.g. gogo-m (Ø-)?s-cad-a tval-eb-i ga-(Ø-)e-xil-a 'the girl
tried to open her eyes'). Again in Series III we have a choice between
Intransitive and Transitive forms: the peculiarity of the Intransitive verb is
that, though it is formally monovalent, it may take a Dative object (e.g.
zaza ar-c ( š ) ( ? Ø - ) c d - i l - a m-is da+mšvid+eb+a-s = zaza ar-c
(še-)(?Ø-)cd-il-a i+s da-(Ø-)e-mšvid-eb-in-a = zaza-s ar-c (Ø-)

da-(Ø-)e-mšvid-eb-in-a 'neither did Zaza try to calm X'). Participles
are: Active m-cd-el-i, Future sa-cd-el-i, Past na-cad-i.
4.1Ø.1 Version as Screeve-marker
We have already met Medials with an indirect object of the type (Ø-)hq'araul-ob 'you guard X/them' where in the Future Sub-Series and in
Series II the indirect object is marked by the Objective Version (viz. (Ø?Ø-Ø-)u-q'araul-eb 'you will guard X/them') such that the appearance of
the versioniser helps (along with the change of Thematic Suffix) to
demarcate the screeve. There are a few Transitive Verbs where the
introduction of a versioniser alone differentiates Prešent from Future SubSeries.
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)vn-eb 'you inflict harm on X/them' (cf. ma-vn-e 'harmful,
malignant') in the Future takes the locative Version and becomes (Ø-?ØØ-)a-vn-eb (Aorist (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-vn-e, Perfect g-i-vn-i-a -tvis) (e.g.
nadir-ma ar (?Ø-Ø-)a-vn-o-s šorena-s 'may the prey do no harm to
Shorena').
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)rg-eb 'you bring benefit to X/them' (cf. ma-rg-eb-el-i with
syncopating - e - 'benign, beneficial', sa-rg-eb-1-oba 'benefit', (Ø-?Ø-)
sa+rg+eb+l-ob/(Ø-?Ø-)i-sa+rg+eb+l-eb 'you (will) take advantage of

(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rg-un-eb 'you (will) allot X/them to Y/them', (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)arg-eb 'you (will) use X/them for the benefit of Y/them', g-e-rg-eb-a 'it494GEORGIANGRAMMARfalls to your lot' => Aorist g-e-rg-o => Perfect g-rg-eb-i-a, or in the
Prešent Sub-Series only 'it belongs to you', ( š e - ) g - e - r g - e b - a 'X
brings/will bring you benefit' 273 , (mo-)g-e-rg-eb-a 'it fits/will fit you',
(mo-XØ-Ø-Ø-)a-rg-eb 'you (will) make X/them fit Y/them') similarly forms
its Future with the locative Version to give (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-rg-eb => Aorist
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-rg-e, Perfect g-i-rg-i-a -tvis.
(Ø-?Ø-)h-k'b-en 'you bite X/them' (cf. k'b+il-i 'tooth', m-k'b-en(ar-)i/m-k'b-en-ar-a 'biting' 274 , (Ø-)i-k'b-in-eb-i 'you bite' only in the
Prešent Sub-Series, t'uč-s/ena-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-k'b-en 'you (will) bite
yourself on the lip/tongue' 275 ) is transformed into the Future by the
introduction of the Objective Version (viz. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-k'b-en 276 => Aorist
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-k'b-in-e => Perfect g-i-k'b-en-i-a -tvis).
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)čkmet' = dialectal (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)p'c'k'-en = 'you pinch X/them'
similarly has the Future (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-čkmet7(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-p'cV-en =>
Aorist (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-čkmit'-e/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-p'c'k'-in-e => Perfect g-ič k m e t ' - i - a / g - i - p ' c V - e n - i - a -tvis, though KEGl also gives (ØØ-)čkmet'/(Ø-Ø-)čkmit'-e/g-i-čkmet'-i-a as Future/Aorist/Perfect
forms respectively.
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)čxvlet' 'you prick/poke X/them' similarly has the Future
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-čxvlet' => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-čxvlit'-e => Perfect g-ičxvlet'-i-a -tvis, though a regular set of paradigms also seems to exist,
formed, according to KEGl, by treating the verb as a simple Root Verb
with preverb da- in the perfective screeves, viz. Future d a - ( Ø Ø-)(5xvlet' => Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)(?xvlit'-e => Perfect da-g-i-čxvlet'i-a—cf. in the Prešent Sub-Series only (m)č'val-i g-čxvlet'-s 'you have
an attack of stitch' (vs (m)č'val-i g-a-dg-a-s 'you have stitch').
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)rk-en 'you butt X/them' (cf. rka 'horn') has Future (Ø-?ØØ-)u-rk-en, Aorist (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-rk-in-e, Perfect g-i-rk-en-i-a -tvis.
4.10.2 Honorifics
GEORGIANhas a number of verb-forms which are used when the speaker is
being exceptionally polite towards his interlocutor.
'Be' (2nd/3rd person subject)
GEORGIANis like a number of European languages in using the 2nd person
plural form of a verb for polite address. And so, for the copula we have,
for example, ro+gora x-a+r? 'how are you' as the familiar form vs
ro+gora x-a+r-t? as a more formal question (obligatory, of course, when
addressing more than one person). However, for an even greater level of
politeness we have ro+gor (Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t?. This preverblessVERBAl MORPHOlOGY495Intransitive form of the root is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series, and
the Prešent Subjunctive is common in the parting-expression k'arg-ad
(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-od-e-t! 'Be well!'. The verb-form is also found, if less
commonly, with 2nd person singular and 3rd person subject (e.g.
msaxur+t+u+x+u+c+es-i vardan dadian-i brjan-d-eb-a 'the Chief
of Domestic Staff is Vardan Dadiani').
'Be' (lst/3rd person subject)
The Stative Verb (Ø-)a-xl-av-s (Past = Imperfect (Ø-)a-xl-d-a, Perfect
(Ø-)xl-eb-i-a) 'X is in attendance upon Y' (cf. a+xl+o(+s) 'near', ( m o - /
mi-)(Ø-Ø-)u-a+xl+o-v-d-eb-i 'you (will) approach X/them') is used to
shew respect to the person being addressed. Examples: inglis+el-i g-axl-av-[v-ja+r-t (lit. 'I, an Englishman, attend you(Pl.)') for inglis+el-i
v-a+r 'I am English'; i+m dro-s tb+il+is-ši g-a-xl-d-i-t 'at that time I
was in Tbilisi' for tb+il+is-ši v-i-q'av-i; e+s čem-i da g-a-xl-av-t
'this is my sister' for e+s čem-i da a+r-i(-s)/da-a; i + s + i + n-i
kart+v+el-eb-i g-a-xl-av-an 'those areGEORGIANs';zaza london-ši
g-a-xl-d-a-t 'Zaza was in london'. Cf. m-xl-eb-el-i (with syncopating
vowel) 'attendant'.
An alternative to the greeting ga-(?Ø-Ø-)u-marj-o-s 'Greetings to X
(Dative)!' is v-a-xl-av-[v-ja+r (+ Dative) when one arrives somewhere.
Also formed from this root is the dynamic verb (Ø-Ø-)e-a+xl-eb-i277 'you
go to attend/visit X/them; you go with X/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-a+xel-i
and with 3rd person singular subject (Ø-Ø-)e-a+xl-a, Perfect (Ø-Ø-)xleb-i-x-a+r, where we see that the stative and dynamic III rd Series
screeves fall together) (e.g. vai, ro+gor da-(Ø-)ber-d-i,
šen-c
si+ber+e g-xl-eb-i-a! 'Alas, how old you have grown, old age has
evidently paid you a visit too!').
'Motion' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root that serves as an honorific copula when preverbless, namely
-brjan-, when endowed with a preverb expressing direction becomes an
honorific for the basic verb of motion (e.g. mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t 'you
(will) come' => Aorist mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, Perfect mo-(Ø-)brjan-ebul-x-a+r-t). It is particularly common in asking questions (e.g. sad mi(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t? 'where are you going?) and in issuing commands (e.g.
mi-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, g-txov-t 'After you, please' = 'Go thither, I beg
you'). When the preverb is da-, the meaning of the verb-form is 'sit down',
whilst with a- the meaning is 'stand up'.","[511, 512, 513, 514]"
"364GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.7.4 Indirect Verb Class (inversi+ul-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)
However they were originally conceived, Indirect Verbs today are those
whose (logical) subject, no matter what the Series, stands in the Dative
case and is co-referenced in the verb-form by means of an agreementaffix of Set B, whilst the (logical) direct object, no matter what the Series,
stands in the Nominative case and is co-referenced in the verb-form by
means of an agreement-affix of Set A—allGEORGIANverbs must carry at
the very least a Set A affix, but for some Indirect Verbs there may be no
Nominative nominal external to the verb to provide a concrete referent for
the relevant affix. Since the Dative nominal is today perceived to be the
subject, an appropriate 3rd person plural Dative will have its plurality
marked on the verb but only in the prešence of a 3rd person direct object,
whilst the plurality of a 3rd person Nominative will, of course, never be
marked on the verb today, because this is viewed as the direct object, and
direct objects do not (prescriptively at any rate) have their plurality
signalled in the verb. This gives us, for example, mk'vidr-eb-s s-)ul-t
m o + m + x d + u r - i / m o + m + x d + u r - e b - i 'the natives hate the incomer/
incomers', which is a reversal of the older pattern of agreement, whereby
the plurality of the 3rd person Dative was ignored, whilst that of the 3rd
person Nominative was indeed marked on the verb, giving as the older
part-equivalent to the above: mk'vidr-s/mk'vidr-eb-s
s-)ul-an
mo+m+xd+ur-eb-i 'the native/natives hate(s) the incomers'. This devel­
opment in the pattern of agreement suggests that originally it was the
Nominative nominal which was interpreted as the subject, whereas the
Dative nominal will at that time have been the indirect object of a normal
bivalent Intransitive Verb; such agreement is common in traditional folk­
tales and is found in the works of the late 19th to the early 2Øth century
writer Vazha Pshavela.
It is sometimes difficult, especially with verbs containing the Indirect
Object Versioniser, to tell whether we are dealing with a bivalent
Intransitive Verb or an Indirect Verb. In 4.1 we mentioned the different
agreement-patterns for the verb 'be born to' as attested in the two
examples from the 19th century writers Ilia C'avč'avadze and Ak'ak'i
Ts'ereteli respectively, namely:
si+t'q'v+a-n-i gul-ši
m-e-bad-eb-i-an
word-Pl-NOM
heart-in me-IOV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-PL
'words/speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'VERBAl MORPHOlOGY365vsšv+il-eb-i
(Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t
child-Pl-NOM (3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-3rd.PER-Pl
'children are born to themDAT'
Does this feature alone mean that the former verb-form is to be
interpreted as a bivalent Intransitive, whilst the latter is to be viewed as
an Indirect Verb? Similarly, if we translate the example p'at'ar+jal-i gve-čven-o-s, p'at'ar+jal-i! 'let the bride shew herself to us, the bride!',
we would judge it to be a bivalent Intransitive, whereas if we translate the
example cot'a maril+ian-i m-e-čven-a sa+č'm+el-i 'I deemed the
food a little salty', we might be tempted to regard the verb as Indirect
(because the 1st person Dative argument is rendered in English as the
subject of the verb), whereas the translation 'the food seemed to me a little
salty' would perhaps favour a bivalent Intransitive interpretation (with 'to
me' equating to the Dative argument of theGEORGIAN).Personally, however,
I would argue that both these verbs in all the usages illustrated above are
to be interpreted as bivalent Intransitives.
In the Prešent Sub-Series the Dative subject is sometimes marked by
means of the agreement-affix alone; alternatively some verb-forms require
the prešence of the Objective Version, others the prešence of the locative
Version, and yet others the prešence of the Indirect Object Version. In
the Future Sub-Series, on the other hand, many Indirect Verbs take the
form of a prefixal Intransitive with obligatory e-versioniser.
Indirect
Verbs proper possess no Series II screeves, and so the Imperfect and
Prešent Subjunctive will take the place of the anticipated Aorist Indicative
and Aorist Subjunctive respectively. The Imperfect Indicative (and Prešent
Subjunctive) will take either -d- or -od- as post-radical marker according
to the requirements of the verb-form in question. In Series III Indirect
Verbs have the basic morphology of bivalent Intransitives, which is to say
that the stem is the Masdar, though it is of course necessary to know the
correct form of the Masdar, which in some cases might not be a
straightforward matter.
In the Prešent Indicative a 1st or 2nd person direct object is indicated
by attaching to the stem the appropriate form of the Prešent tense of the
copula, whilst a 3rd person Nominative nominal is indicated by either -s or
-a, as required by the verb in question. Since it is verb-forms rather than
roots which are classified for conjugational type, readers will by now have
come to expect that the root of any given Indirect Verb is likely to have
cognate verb-forms of other conjugational types; these will be pointed out
as we go along.","[382, 383, 384]"

The preverb may be mo- under appropriate conditions.
Clearly the morphemic analysis of this verb-form is problematic: the Nominative case marking of 'enemy' would suggest that the second zero-morph of the verb should
carry the question-mark, but the fact that this Nominative nominal 'controls' the
versioniser suggests that the first zero-morph is the one without an external noun.
Under appropriate circumstances the preverb may change to mo-.
Clearly the underlying form here is /ga-0-q'v-a/. Since the 3rd person singular of
the copula in the Aorist has a similar underlying root-suffixal sequence, namely / i q'v-a/, which in this book I write i-q'+o, for consistency I should perhaps also write
ga-(0-)q'+o here.
At least this is the prescriptive rule, even if the occasional exception is found in
texts.
Note this almost literal equivalent to the English method of giving dates, whereas the
normal way today would be to say rva ianvar-s 8 January-DAT 'on the 8th
January'.
In such combinations one of these labio-dentals may fail to be pronounced.
Note that the radical labio-dental drops under the influence of this immediately
following bilabial.
As explained in 5.2.2.1.7.4.3, a past temporal clause meaning 'before' is normally
constructed with the Conditional (or Aorist). Is the presence here of the Pluperfect in
the subordinate clause the result of the influence of the preceding Pluperfect or just
a variant in the same way as English here allows both 'before you had VERBed' and
'before you VERBed'?
Interestingly in the Mingrelian language, spoken in part of West Georgia, the
Pluperfect of active voiced Transitive Verbs stands in the same relation to the
Perfect as the Imperfect Indicative does to the Present Indicative, with the Objective
Version generalised for marking the subject (e.g. do-m-(i-)č'ar(-u) = Georgian dam-i-c'er-i-a 'I have written X/them' vs do-m-(i-)č'ar-u-d(-u)
= Georgian da-me-c'er-a 'I had written X/them').
Mingrelian has formalised this semantic distinction, at least as far as Series I
screeves are concerned: i-č'ar-u 'X is being written' vs i-č'ar-e 'X can be written';
m-a-č'ar-u 'X is being written for/on me' vs m-a-č'ar-e 'I can write X/them'.
Interestingly Mingrelian uses the active voice (Transitive pattern) for both such
verbs, viz. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rz-en-k vs (Ø-Ø-)i-rz-en-k
This particular paradigm is a common Present Indicative for a number of verbs
distinguished outside the Present Sub-Series by different preverbs. Perhaps the
forms presented here are most often used in the sense of 'I remain/stay', which
implies the use of the preverb da-.
Examples in KEGL suggest that, if the indirect object is inanimate, it may be
expressed by means of the Objective Version.
This is the root-form of the Perfect as quoted by KEGL. However, in V. Topuria and
Iv. Gigineishvili's 'Orthographic Dictionary' of 1968 the root-form ga-g-i-jg-i-a is
given.
Do not confuse this with (ga-)i-njr-ev-i 'you (will) move', the Intransitive form of
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-njr-ev = (ga-XØ-Ø-)jr-av 'you (will) set X/them in motion'.
The Imperfect equivalent of sa-k'itx-i i-s-m-i-s 'a question is being posed' is sak'itx-i i-s-m-od-a.
The meaning 'come forth to meet' would result from a change of preverb to mo-.
KEGL wrongly gives this form as the impossible mo-i-xvn-a.
Note the devoicing of the back fricative in the first two persons.
For this one verb Tschenkéli (1958.I.271) reports a variant in - e .","[527, 528]"
"192GEORGI AN GRAMMAR4.4.6 Interplay of Versions and the Marking of Arguments
Performing actions such as the following to parts of the subject's own body
naturally motivates the appearance of the Subjective Version: p'ir-s da(Ø-Ø-)i-ban 'you will wash your face', tma-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'reč' 'you will
cut your hear', cxvir-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-xoc-av 'you will wipe your nose'. It
might be thought that performing these actions for another person would
result in a switch to the Objective Version, whereas in fact the indirect
object is indicated without recourse to any of the versionisers, as may be
seen in: p'ir-s da-(Ø-Ø-)m-ban 'you will wash my face', tma-s mo(Ø-)g-k'reč' 'I will cut your hear', deda cxvir-eb-s mo-(Ø-)gv-xocav-s 'mother will wipe our noses'. The same interplay is seen in the case
of taking off one's own vs another's item of clothing, viz. p'alt'o-s ga-(00-)i-xd-i 'you will take off your coat' vs p'alt'o-s ga-(Ø-Ø-)m-xd-i 'you
will remove my coat'; c'ind-eb-s ga-v-(Ø-)i-xd-i 'I shall take off my
socks/stockings' vs c'ind-eb-s bavšv-s ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)-xd-i 'I shall
remove the child's socks/stockings'; mama kud-s mo-(Ø-)i-xd-i-s 'father
will take off his hat' vs mama šv+il-s kud-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)-xd-i-s 'father
will remove the hat from his child's head'.
When it comes to putting clothing on, the Subjective Version alternates
with the locative (e.g. maisur-s ča-(Ø-Ø-)i-cv-am 'you will put on your
vest' vs maisur-s bavàv-s ča-(0-0-0-)a-cv-am 'you will put the vest
on the baby', mc'q'ems-i nabad-s mo-(Ø-)i-sx-am-s 'the shepherd will
don his felt-cloak' vs mc'q'ems-i st'umar-s nabad-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-sxam-s 'the shepherd will put his felt-cloak on the guest', kud-s da-v(Ø-)i-xur-av 'I shall put on my hat' vs inglis+el-s svan+ur kud-s dav-(Ø-Ø-)a-xur-av 'I shall put a Svan hat on the Englishman's head'—note
the three roots for putting on clothing depend on whether the item involves
a part of the body being inserted into it vs whether the item folds around
the body vs whether the items rests on the head. For the Future SubSeries and Series II of the root -sc'avl- the versional opposition just
illustrated causes a shift in meaning (viz. ucxo+el-i kart+ul-s (Ø-)is c ' a v l - i - s 'the foreigner will learnGEORGIAN'vs šukia ucxo+el-s

At least three roots (namely -g- 'understand', -jer- 'believe', and - s m 'listen to') exemplify an interesting alternation between Subjective and
Objective Versions whereby the former is used in the prešence of only the
direct object reprešenting what is listened to/understood/believed, whereas
the latter is required in the prešence of the indirect object reprešenting
the person listened to/understood/believed regardless of whether the
direct object slot is externally filled or not, e.g.

With other roots the use of the Subjective Version when the verb has
no indirect object contrasts with the abšence of any versioniser in the
prešence of an indirect object. Examples: p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)i-txov 'you will
ask for bread' vs mezobel-s p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)s-txov 'you will ask the
neighbour for bread', p'olici+el-eb-ma

among the people' vs xalx-s (Ø-Ø-)h-k'itx-e 'you asked the people (sc.
about something)'. With the final opposition from the previous paragraph
compare the somewhat archaic expression seen in:196GEORGIANGRAMMAR

Note also what happens with the root -q'id- in the Future Sub-Series
and Series II: Subjective Versional saxl-s v-(Ø-)i-q'id-i 'I'll buy a/the
house' vs saxl-s mo-(Ø-)g-q'id-i 'I'll sell the house to you' or saxl-s
mi-(Ø-Ø-)h-q'id-i kal-s 'you will sell the house to the woman' (vs the
Neutral Versional saxl-s ga-v-(Ø-)q'id-i 'I'll sell the house').
Since the Subjective Version does not always appear when one would
logically expect it, it is perhaps hardly surprising that one can adduce
examples where the locative Version wins out when either the Subjective
or the locative Version could logically be employed, e.g.

No Subjective Version is possible when the root requires the indirect
object to be marked without versioniser, e.g.

In a colloquial expression for 'gathering X together', the direct object
tav-i does not belong to the verb's subject and so would never motivate
the Subjective Version, e.g.

PREV-(it-)him-slice-they(AOR)To judge by the examples given by KEGl, the use of the locative
Version in these expressions is the less common of the alternatives, and a198GEORGIANGRAMMARcolloquialism incorporating the root -k'vet- is possible only when no

Note the prešence of the preverb m o - in these examples, which
replaces each root's normal preverb to emphasise the fact that the action
does not apply to the whole of the indirect object. This is seen clearly in
the KEGl definition for mo-(Ø-)s-c'v-av-s, which is:

Minaia-DATWe have already seen an example of the root -d- 'put' with preverb

without a versioniser, though the attested examples suggest that this usage
is linked to less concrete cases of 'placement', e.g.

Intransitive Verbs provide examples of an opposition between locative
and Objective Versions in (virtually) synonymous expressions. Consider:
kal-i
mi-(Ø-)a-dg-eb-a
woman-NOM PREV-(it-)lV-approach-TS(FUT)-shedev-is
ogre-GENsaxl-s
houš
DAT'the woman will approach/draw near the ogre's house'
when KEGl glosses this very verb-form as:
ra-s-me
sul
axlo+s da-(Ø-)u-dg-eb-a
anything-DAT-INDEF absolutely close
PREV-(it-)OV-standTS(FUT)-X
'X will draw really close to something'
where the root is identical, though this time with Objective Version and a
different preverb; another verb for 'approach' also illustrates Objective
Version, namely:
kal-i mi-(Ø-)u-axlo+v-d-eb-a
PREV-(it-)OV-approach-PASS-TS(FUT)-Xdev-issaxl-sFor the idea of 'taking up position close by X' we have (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-)udg-eb-i, often reinforced by such a word as gverd-ze 'at the side';
however, the form (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)u-dg-eb-i is used for 'treat/examine X' as

'we shall treat/examine this question seriously'
whereas (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)u-dg-eb-i, reinforced by mxar-ši 'at the shoulder',
is used for 'support X', as in:200GEORGI AN GRAMMARp'at'ar-eb-o,mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-dek-i-tsmall-Pl-VOCPREV-(you-3rd.PER-)OV-support-AOR.I NDI C(=I MPER)Pldid-eb-s

'you will set off (on a journey)'
KEGl offers the alternative gza-s da-(Ø-Ø-)a-dg-eb-i, with the
same root this time shewing locative Version but also with a different
preverb. The transitive root -rt'q'- 'hit' shews a similar variation with the
instrument of hitting treated either as direct object (presumably its original
role) or placed in the Instrumental with the direct object unmarked
externally to the verb, viz.

It is also possible to point to an interplay between Objective Version
and lack of versioniser with some intransitive verb-forms. An indirect
object can be associated with the basic verb of motion. I n the Future SubSeries and in Series 11 this indirect object has to be indicated by the201VERBAl MORPHOlOGYObjective Version—for mo-svl-a 'coming' this gives examples like ra mog-i-va-t? 'what will come over you(Pl)?', ra mo-gv-i-vid-od-a? 'what
would come/would have come over us?', ra mo-(Ø-)u-vid-a-t? 'what
came over them?', etc... In the Prešent Sub-Series the lack of versioniser
seems more common, for this coupling of preverb and root at any rate (e.g.
ra mo-s-di-t? 'what comes over them?'). This verb-form can also mean
with either marking of the indirect object 'receive, gain, acquire', though in
the expression 'liquid flows from' (as in:
t'an-i+dan sisxl-i
mo-s-di-od-a
body-from
blood-NOM PREV-X-flow-I MPERF-it
'blood was flowing from X's body')
it seems from KEGl's illustrations that the Objective Version is not used.
For the motion-root in association with other preverbs it will sometimes be
the case that in the Prešent Sub-Series some šense(s) may be conveyed by
either marking of the indirect object, whereas others may be particular to
one method or the other, e.g.

However, if we take the example: cxen-s pex-i mo-s-t'q'd-a 'the
horse got its leg broken', we cannot convert this verb-form into one where
Objective Version - u - substitutes for the - s - and end up with a
synonymous expression, for such a substitution would imply a structure of
the form:
cxen-s
pex-i

X-DATThe 'horse' remains the indirect object possessing the broken leg (and
presumably marked by the first notional zero-morph), whilst the horse's
owner is added as second indirect object, dependent upon the Objective
Version vowel. Similar analyses are called for in the case of some of those
remarkable 'Intransitive' Verbs which yet can be associated with two
arguments, e.g.

4.4.7 indirect Object Version iser
This version-vowel, if indeed it can be properly so called, basically serves
as substitute for the most widespread passive/intransitive-marker for
screeves in Series I and II, namely i-, when an indirect object is
associated with such a passive/intransitive verb. I f we take the verb-form
(i+s) i-c'er-eb-a as a monovalent passive 'X is being written', a Dative
indirect object can be associated with this verb-form simply by placing the
relevant (pro)noun in the Dative and switching the initial vowel, thus:
(ma-s) (Ø-)e-c'er-eb-a. Out of context this verb-phrase can mean: 1.
'X is being written for Y', which correlates with the active voice in
Objective Version ((vin+me vin+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-Ø-)u-c'er-s
'someone writes something for someone'); 2. 'X is being written on Y', which
correlates with the active voice in locative Version ((vin+me vin+mes/ra+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-Ø-)a-c'er-s 'someone writes something on
someone/something'), 3. 'X is being written to Y', which correlates with the
active voice marking its indirect object without versioniser ((vin+me
vin+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-)s-c'er-s 'someone writes something to
someone'). In other words, a passive/intransitive in e- can have as many
meanings as the equivalent active voice can have different types of
semantic nuances for its range of differently marked indirect objects.
Where a range of preverbs characterises the active voice, the same range
will apply to the passive, and, since the active voice verb-forms quoted
above do not employ just one preverb outside the Prešent Sub-Series, the
same distinctions will be made for the bivalent passive, giving the following
Prešent-Future, active-passive correlations:205VERBAl MORPHOlOGY

Just as the postposition -ze often reinforces (and thereby strictly
renders superfluous) the Locative Version for active voice verbs, so the
Dative nominal with these bipersonal Intransitives sometimes gives way to
a postpositional phrase (thereby rendering them monovalent), as in:2Ø6GEORGIANGRAMMARsp'ilo

'the elephant flopped to the ground with its whole body'
vs pr+in+v+el-i mic'a-ze ga-(?Ø-)e-rtx-a 'the bird flopped down on

postpositional variant, e.g.

ča-(?Ø-)e-b-a
warrior-NOM fight-in
PREV-(?it-)IOV-get.stuck.into-he(AOR)
'the warrior got stuck into the battle'
On other occasions such verbs may be used with an indirect object or
simply without one, as appropriate, e.g.

The e-versioniser may mark the 'logical' subject for certain so-called
'Indirect Verbs' (such as with the root - s m - 'hear, understand, detect a
smell':VERBAl MORPHOlOGY

(Ø-Ø-) amb-ob 'I understand that which you say'). Indeed, this is the
normal way of expressing such 'logical' subjects in Future Sub-Series
screeves, e.g.

'I shall have the money tomorrow'xval
tomorrowIndirect Verbs have no Series II, unless one counts the somewhat
anomalous (Ø-)e-q'+ol-a, which, as stated by KEGl, is sometimes used for
the Future (Ø-)e-q'+ol-eb-a 'X will have animate Y/them'. Similarly the
e-versioniser is employed automatically in the Future Sub-Series and in
Series 11 for Stative Verbs, whether or not there exists an external
argument in the Dative, e.g.

'you will have the address written in your diary'
For ( š ) g - e - b r a l - e b - a 'you (will) pity X/them' there is a synonym
(š)g-bral-d-eb-a.
Two special sub-types of Indirect Verbs which have their logical
subject indicated by the e-versioniser are: (a) those that express a desire
on the part of the logical subject. Such verbs only exist in the Prešent
Sub-Series, and there is no external referent for their obligatory Set A
agreement-affix (e.g. gogo-s (Ø-)e-mger-eb-a 'the girl has a hankering
to sing', gogo-s (Ø-)e-t'ir-eb-a 'the girl has a hankering to cry', gogo-s

andSimilar formations often indicate that the action occurs without the
intention of the Dative nominal concerned; these formations are not limited
to the Prešent Sub-Series (e.g. ga-m-e-cin-a 'I burst out laughing', gagv-e-gim-eb-a 'we shall break out in smiles'). (b) Indirect Verbs with the
e-versioniser and with additional Series 11 forms (but minus any preverb)
can be formed from adjectives to express the idea 'X judges Y/them to be
ADJECTIVE' (e.g. advil-i 'easy' => g-e-advil-eb-a/g-e-advil-a 'you
deem/deemed X/them to be easy', u+xerx+ul-i 'embarrassing' => g-eu + xerx + u l - e b - a / g - e - u + xerx + ul-a 'you deem/deemed X/them

note the existence of a few roots which can be treated either as simple
Transitives or in the Prešent Sub-Series only as bipersonal Intransitives in

'you
(will) invite X/them' the equivalence holds throughout both Series I and 11
(e.g. (Ø-Ø-)e-p'at'iž-e = da-(Ø-Ø-)p'at'iž-e 'you invited X/them', though
the syntactic configuration in Series 11 is different, the former verb-form
taking a Nominative subject and Dative object, the latter an Ergative
subject and Nominative object).
For the role of the e-versioniser as obligatory component in the
marking of the verb's Dative subject in the Pluperfect and 111 rd
Subjunctive of Transitive and Medial Verbs see 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3. Apart
from the e-versioniser's role as part-marker of subjects for Transitive and
Medial Verbs in the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive, it is surprisingly
found with two related roots in their transitive Series I and 11 screeves,
and this despite the fact that their second argument is a direct rather than
indirect object (viz. (Ø-Ø-)e-j+eb 'you (will) seek X/them': (Ø-Ø-)e-j+
eb-e 'you sought X/them': g-i-j+eb-n-i-a 'you have apparently sought
X/them' vs (Ø-Ø-)e-ji-eb 'you (will) seek X/them': (Ø-Ø-)e-ji-e 'you

versioniser is construed with an actual indirect object, viz.

hunter(NOM) I-SV-be-AOR.SUBJ
'Would that I too were a hunter of your type!'
A peculiarity of such wishes is that one often finds a transitive verb not
only in the Aorist Indicative but with an unexpressed 3rd person singular
subject, e.g.
net'avi axla čem-i tamro
da-(Ø-)m-a-nax-v-a!
let
now my-AGR Tamro(NOM) PREV-(her-)me-LV-make.see-TSX(AOR)
'Would that X would now let me see my Tamro!5, which is virtually the
translation-equivalent of 'would that ƒ could see my Tamro').
3.6.8 Pleading Particles
Peremptory commands can be toned down somewhat by adding ra with a
rise-fall pitch at the end of the sentence (e.g. c'a-Iv-Jvid-e-t, ra! 'let's
go, can't we?', e+s ga-(Ø-)m-i-k'et-e, ra! 'do this for me, please').
Georgian has no simple word for 'please'; the last example could be
rephrased with g - t x o v 'I beg/urge/request you' replacing ra —
alternatively, one could turn the sentence round to give g-txov e+s ga(Ø-)m-i-k'et-o 'I request you to do (= Aorist Subjunctive) this for me', or
again g-txov, e+s ga-(Ø-)m-i-k'et-e (ra)r where the Imperative is
used (with or without the softening ra).
A more or less synonymous effect is achieved by placing mo-di, the
singular imperative of the verb 'come', before the command (with or without
ra at the end).
Use of the cardinal ert-i '1' also has a parallel effect—it is often
combined with aba, e.g.
aba, ert + i,
ča-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-q'ar-o-t

PREV-1 st.PER-(it-it-)OV-cast.down-AOR.SUBJ-PL

(it-)you-OV-relate-TS-PL
'since it's a conversation I am just relating X to you'
3.6.9 Attention-grabbing Particle
The equivalent of 'lo!' (French 'voilà/voici!') is ai, e.g. ai Sen-i da! 'lo/look,
here's your sister!',
ai e + s k'ac-i-a,
rom (Ø-)g-e-ubn-eb-od-i

3.6.10 Contrastive Particles

turme 'evidently, apparently', e.g.

3.6.13 Approximative Particle
Suffixed to a cardinal (with its Nominative desinence, which thus is fused to
the root) -ode gives the meaning 'round about NUMBER', e.g.
švid+i-ode gogo-s/švid+i-ode-s
7-about
girl-DAT/7-about-DAT
'I see about 7 girls/about 7'v-(0-)xed-av
I -(3rd.PER-)see-TS(PRES)Such forms are treated as vowel-final nouns or adjectives.
3.6.14 Verb-governing Particles
u+nd + a, the modal particle of necessity, is the fossilised form of the
Present tense of the verb 'want' with 3rd person singular subject and
object. For the associated syntax see 5.2.2.3.3.
A similarly fossilised form of this same verb but with 2nd person
singular subject (viz. g+i+nd(+a)) is reduplicated to give the meaning
'whether A or B', e.g.
g+i+nd a + s + e g+i+nd+a i + s+e, sul-ert-i-a
whether like.this or
like.that wholly-one-NOM-is
'it's all the same whether it's like this or like that'

g+i+nd i-q'-o-s

and or

Used alone this fossil functions as a subordinate conjunction equivalent
to rom-c 'even if', e.g.

I-IOV-sleep-AOR.SUBJ-Xmainc
stillsul-ši
soul-in'Even if/though I am asleep, you still sit in my soul'm-i-zi-x-a+r
me-OV-sit-yoube(PRES)95NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYNotice how the fossil tends to preserve its basic root's power of
governing a subjunctive verb.
Another fossil, originally a finite verb meaning 'it is possible for X', is
e+g+eb(+i+s)/e+g+eb+a, which has as a synonym the parallel fossil from
the still very much extant verb 'it will be' i+kn+eb(+a). The meaning is
'maybe' and the associated verb is usually, though not necessarily,
subjunctive, e.g.
e+g+eb
(Ø-Ø-)a-job-o-s,
rom a+ma+gam
maybe
(it-it-)LV-be.preferable-AOR.SUBJ-it
that tonight
a+k da-(0-)rč-e
here PREV-(you-)stay-AOR.SUBJ
'maybe it's preferable that tonight you remain here'
Similar to the last two particles is vinjlo, which similarly governs the
Aorist Subjunctive. 11 means 'perhaps' but adds a note of encouragement
for the verbal activity, e.g.
vinjlo ar da-(Ø-Ø-)i-c'un-o
č'iatura-c
maybe not PREV-(you-it-)SV-find.distasteful-AOR.SUBJ
Ch'iatura-too
'maybe you won't find Ch'iatura displeasing either (and I hope you
won't)'

da-(Ø-Ø-)i-c""ir-o
maybe alive-PL-NOM
PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)SV-catch-AOR.SUBJ
'maybe you'll catch them alive (and I hope you do/do try to)'
Another verb in origin is lam+i+s 'almost', which has as synonyms
k'inagam or t+i+tk+m+i+s (cf. 5.1.12) or again the full expression cot'aga (Ø-)a-k'l-i-a, rom... 'but little is lacking that...'. It takes the Aorist
Subjunctive, e.g.
tval-eb-ši na+car-s (0-)gv-a-q'r-i-an,
eye-PL-in
ash-DAT (it-)us-LV-throw-TS(PRES)-hey
da-gv-a-brma-o-n
PREV-us-NV-blind-AOR.SUBJ-they
'they hurl ash in our eyes, they almost blind us'lam+i+s
almostIn Old Georgian wishes were expressed by the particle -mc(a). It was
not attached to the verb itself, which was in the indicative mood (usually
Aorist)6. This particle is almost completely lost today, but it does still
occur in the occasional expression, such as c'q'+e+ul-i-mc v-i-q'-o 'may96GEORGIAN GRAMMARI be cursed', where we note the verb is Aorist Subjunctive, which shews
that the particle has lost its original force. Note also the sequence -mc in
two negative phrases: ara+mc da ara+mc ar (= ara + v i t a r
äe+mtxv+ev+a-ši) 'under no circumstances', e.g.

See 3.7.2.1.5 for the
subordinating conjunction tu+mc(a) 'although'.
vin+i+c+oba+a is an abstract noun in -oba based on the question vin
i-c-i-s? 'who knows?' to which the copula -a 'it is' is suffixed. It is used
in the sense of 'in case, by chance'. It can either be inserted into a
sentence as an adverb, e.g.

mood, which, though not absolutely excluded after tu, is less common than
the indicative and may thus have been occasioned here by the particle) or

h2.1.1.1 Consonan t-complexes
Whilst the basic inventory of consonantal phonemes may be unexceptional,
Georgian is distinguished by its tolerance of consonant-complexes.
Readers may like to refer to Hans Vogt (1958, reprinted 1988, or 1961 in
Georgian translation) for a detailed analysis. Vogt catalogues a grand total
of 740 initial complexes (ignoring, of course, sequences containing a
morpheme-boundary). With all its 28 simplex consonants also all able to
stand word-initially, Georgian thus has 768 possible ways of beginning a
word consonantally. Of the complexes 233 are two-term, 334 three-term,
148 four-term, 21 five-term and 4 six-term.
Examples:20GEORGI AN GRAMMARlt'ol-v-il-i 'refugee', mq'aq'e 'stagnant', q'da '(book-)cover';
grdeml-i 'anvil', txmela 'alder', mxc+ovan-i/mcx+ovan-i 'grey-haired,
venerable' (cf. (m)xce 'grey hair'), t'q'laš + ani-i 'sound of clapping,
slapping', jrc'-ol-a 'shaking', t k v e n 'you (PL)', brbo 'crowd', t'k'b+il-i
'sweet', č r č i l - i '(clothes') moth', d v r i t ' a 'rennet', m c ' q ' e r - i 'quail',
p'c'k'ared-i 'interlinear translation';
prtxil-i 'careful', sxlt'-eb-a 'it springs', m g v r i e 'turbid', brjgu 'thick',
g r g n - a 'gnawing', črčn-a 'pecking, plucking out', žgvlem-a 'kneading
roughly', č'q'vlep'-a 'kneading roughly with the hand', čxnde 'weir, dam',
čxndo 'bundle';
c'vrtn-a 'training', brč'q'vial-i 'glitter', bdgvrial-i/brdgvial-i 'shining
bright', bdgvn-a/p't'k'vn-a 'plucking;
brdgvn-a 'plucking', prckvn-a 'peeling', prčxvn-a (dialectal for pávn-a)
'crumbling to pieces'.
For word-final position Vogt found 244 complexes (148 two-term, 82
three-term, 14 four-term).
Complexes, both initial and final, can often be lengthened by addition of
other consonantal morphemes (e.g. g v - p r c k v n - i 'you peel us', ančxl-s
'hot-tempered one (Dative)').
Kartvelologists regularly set apart a special sub-set of complexes
known as 'harmonic complexes'. Gamq'relidze (1966.77) defined these as
'consonant sequences in which a nonvelar voiced, voiceless (aspirated), or
glottalized stop or affricate is followed by a homogeneous velar [sc. or
uvular—BGH] consonant', such complexes having the characteristic that in
the root-structure they are 'functionally identical with a simple consonant'.
Harmonic complexes are, thus, of the type seen in : pxa 'fish-bone', dge
'day', txov+n-a 'request', j g - o m - a 'stuffing oneself full', t'q'e 'forest',
u c ' q ' - i 'you know', c x i m - i 'fat', bgera 'sound', č'q'let'-a 'squashing',
pkv+il-i 'flour', dg-a-s 'X is standing', tkv-a 'X said', mt'k'avel-i 'span',
c'k'n-d-eb-a '(liquid) clears', jger-a 'beating (of heart)', cker-a 'looking',
ǰiǰgn-a = c'ic'k'n-a 'ripping apart', č'eč'k'-av 'you chop into small
pieces', čečk-av = tetk-av 'you soften by beating'.
Mač'avariani
(1965.81-96), from whom the previous illustrations were taken, also
classifies as 'harmonic' those complexes with an initial alveolar fricative,
such as: zgva 'sea', sisxl-i 'blood', sk'a 'hive'. He even includes those in
which the second element is a dental-alveolar, such as: Old Georgian
stuel-i (= Modern rtvel-i) 'vintage', e-sc'r-eb-i 'you attend X', st'v+ena 'whistling'.
2.1.2 Vowels [xm+ovn-eb-i]SOUND SYSTEM21The five vowels are:2.2Phonotactics2.2.1 Phonetic realisation of the consonants
There is perhaps a slight tendency somewhat to devoice word-final voiced
obstruents, but this is hardly a pronounced or widespread phenomenon.
However, in a very few cases it has evidently led to some words which
were originally Adverbials in final [-d] being pronounced and written today
with final -t (e.g. eg+r+e-t [<= ?*eg+r+e-d] c'od+eb+ul-i 'so called',
u+neb+1+i+e-t [<= *u+neb+l+i+e-d] 'unwillingly').
The uvular plosive is regularly accompanied by strong friction to
produce the articulation [qx'].
The labio-dental fricative when standing between consonant and vowel
or between consonant and consonant (i.e. in the environments C-V & C-C) is
often pronounced as the bilabial semi-vowel [w] (e.g. k'ver-i [k'weri] 'breadroll', jvl+ian-i [jwliani] 'boney'). Before voiceless consonants it may be
pronounced as a voiceless labio-dental or even bilabial fricative (viz. [f]/[Φ])
(e.g. bav£v-s [baf§ws]/[ba<f)sws] 'baby (Dative)', v-tamaä-ob [ftamaáob] 'I
play', v-pikr-ob [Φpikrob]/[fpikrob] 'I think'). Pre-vocalically word-initially
or post-vocalically word-finally Robins and Waterson (1952) report as a
possible variant the voiced bilabial fricative [ß ] (e.g. vi + g a c [ßigac]
'someone', mudm+iv [mudmiß] 'always'). Before /u/ and lol in verbs the
labio-dental fricative regularly disappears, so that the past participle of
verbs in - e v is in - e - u l - (e.g. d a - n g r - e - u l - i <= *da-ngr-ev-ul-i
'destroyed')—pex-i m-t'k'iv-a 'my foot hurts' vs pex-i m-t'k'i-od-a 'my
foot was hurting'; ga-sa-g-eb-i da-g-k'arg-v-i-a 'you've evidently lost
the key' vs ga-sa-g-eb-i da-g-k'arg-od-a 'you had lost the key'. But
when the fricative marks a 1st person subject by no means all speakers
drop it when it is followed by lul (e.g. v-u-txar-i [vutxari] 'I told X/them'),
though for those speakers who do drop it in these circumstances the
distinction between the relevant verb with 1st and 2nd person subject is
neutralised (viz. [utxari], which for such speakers may be the realisation of
/v-u-txar-i/ 'I told X/them' or /u-txar-i/ 'you told X/them').
The two back-fricatives have both a fronted dorso-velar and a backed
dorso-uvular articulation depending on the phonetic environment in which22GEORGI AN GRAMMARthey occur—hence their presentation separately from both the dorso-velar
and the dorso-uvular series of stops. Robins and Waterson treat them as
velars, whereas most commentators today place them alongside /qV.
The 2nd person pronominal prefix g- when standing immediately before
a velar or uvular is likely to be realised as a back fricative, either voiced
or voiceless (e.g. g-xed-av [gxedav]/[x:edav] 'I see you', g-gl-i-s [g:lis] 'X
tires you', g-q'av-s [ʁq'avs]/[xq'avs] 'you have animate X/them')—cf. magxel-a [magxela] 'of that amount/size'.
The alveolar nasal has the velar/uvular allophones [n]/[N] when followed
by a velar/uvular plosive, as long as no morpheme-boundary intervenes
(e.g. gingl-i [gingli] 'down', zinq'-i [ziNq'i] 'top of the hip' (dialectal) vs ganq'en+eb+it-i [ganq'enebiti] 'abstract-').
The rhotic is more rolled than in standard English and may be devoiced
when next to a voiceless consonant.
2.2.2 Phonetic realisation of vowels
The five vowels are short, though there is secondary lengthening under the
influence of the rise-fall pitch that marks a yes-no question (see 2.4.2).
Sequences of vowels are pronounced as such, so that there are always as
many syllables per word as there are vowels (e.g. ga-a-advil-eb 'you will
facilitate X/them' is the five-syllable [gaaadvileb]).
Sonants in consonant-complexes have no syllable-forming capacity.
2.2.3 Epenthesis
2.2.3.1 -v
Adjectives ending in -a and -o add -v- when they become the root of a
verb (e.g. brma 'blind' => a-brma-v-eb 'you blind X/them' and brma-v-deb-i 'you become blind'; parto 'wide' => a-parto-v-eb 'you widen X/them'
and p a r t o - v - d - e b - a 'X widens'). However, if the adjective ends in -u,
the addition of the fricative is essential only in the intransitive formation
(e.g. q'ru 'deaf' => q'ru-v-d-eb-i 'you become deaf' BUT a-q'ru-eb 'you
deafen X/them'—N.B. the optional presence of the fricative in the masdar
[= verbal noun] q'ru-(v-)eb-a).
Some roots accompanied by the Thematic Suffix -ob end in a -v which
naturally disappears before the o-vowel in this suffix (or, of course, in any
other suffix that may take the place of this ending elsewhere in the
conjugational paradigm). When not followed by an o-vowel, the fricative
reappears (e.g. a-cx-ob 'you bake X/them' => ga-mo-a-cxv-e 'you baked
X/them'). For some verbs this fricative is optional (e.g. i-t'q-ob 'youSOUND SYSTEM23notice/find out X/them' => še-i-t'q'(v)-e 'you noticed/found out X/them').
In some verbs the restored fricative slots inside the root itself (e.g. a-trob 'you get X/them drunk' => da-a-tvr-e 'you got X/them drunk'); this is
not limited to roots that end in a sonant (e.g. a-c'rt-ob 'you temper (metal)'
=> a-cVrt-e 'you tempered X/them').
22.3.2 -a
Roots with Thematic Suffix -av which have no vowel in the Present and
which end in one of the sonants -1/n/r expand the root in the Aorist
Indicative when the subject is 1st or 2nd person (and also in the active
Pluperfect when the direct object is 1st or 2nd person) (e.g. k'l-av 'you kill
X' => mo-v-k'al-i(-t) 'I (we) killed X/them', mo-k'al-i(-t) 'you (you PI.)
killed X/them', mo-k'l-a//mo-k'l-es 'X killed Y/them//they killed X/them',
mo-v-e-k'al-if-t) 'X/they had killed me (us)', mo-e-k'al-i(-t) 'X/they
had killed you (you PI.)', mo-gv-e-k'1-a 'we had killed X/them'; xn-av 'you
plough X/them' => mo-v-xan-i 'I ploughed X/them' etc.; tval-s v-k'r-av
'I catch sight of X/them' => tval-i mo-v-k'ar-i 'I caught sight of X/them',
etc.).
The same expansion takes place in the Aorist of the suppletive root of
the copula (viz. v-i-q'av-i(-t) 'I was (we were)', i-q'av-i(-t) 'you (you (PI.)
were'), i-q'o <= *i-q'v-a 'X was'/i-q'v-nen 'they were'). With this may be
compared the homonymous root 'divide' (viz. q'-op 'you divide X/them' =>
ga-v-q'av-i(-t) 'I (we) divided X/them', ga-q'av-i(-t) 'you (you PI.)
divided X/them', ga-q'o/Zga-q'v-es 'X divided Y/them//they divided
X/them').
A few roots with Thematic Suffix -eb or -ob behave in the same way
(e.g. a-sc'r-eb 'you do X/them in time' => mo-v-a-sc'ar-i(-t) 'I (we) did
X/them in time', mo-a-sc'ar-i(-t) 'you (you PI.) did X/them in time', mo-asc'r-oZZmo-a-sc'r-es 'X did Y/them in time//they did X/them in time'; acn-ob 'you introduce X/them to Y/them' => ga-v-a-can-i(-t) 'I (we)
introduced X/them to Y/them', ga-a-can-i(-t) 'you (you PI.) introduced
X/them to Y/them', ga-a-cn-oZZga-a-cvn 1 -es 'X introduced Y/them to
Z/them//they introduced X/them to Y/them').
Some roots with Thematic Suffix -i and with no vowel in the Present
expand the root in Series 11 (viz. Aorist I ndicative and Subjunctive) as well
in the active Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive from Series III by adding
- a - throughout (e.g. š1-i 'you erase X/them' => c'a-v-šal-e(-t) 'I (we)
erased X/them', c'a-šal-eí-t) 'you (you PI.) erased X/them', c'a-šalaZZc'a-šal-es 'X erased Y/them//they erased X/them', unda c'a-v-šalo 'I must erase X/them' e t c . , c'a-e-šal-a-t 'they had erased X/them'
e t c . , ar m-a-xs+ov-s ra(i)-me c'a-m-e-šal-o-s 'I don't recall erasing24GEORGI AN GRAMMAR[IIIrd Subjunctive] anything' etc.). This phenomenon is not restricted to
roots that end in a sonant (e.g. sǰ-i 'you punish X/them' => da-v-saǰ-e 'I
punished X/them' etc.).
2.2.3.3 -eSome roots with Thematic Suffix -ob, -eb, or -i that end in a sonant and
have no vowel in the Present expand the root in the Aorist Indicative when
the subject is 1st or 2nd person or in the active Pluperfect when the direct
object is 1st or 2nd person (e.g. a-q'rdn-ob 'you lean X/them against
Y/them' => mi-v-a-q'rden-i(-t) 'I (we) leaned X/them against Y/them', mia-q'rden-i(-t) 'you (you P1.) leaned X/them against Y/them', mi-a-q'rdno//mi-a-q,rdn-es 'X leaned Y/them against Z/them//they leaned X/them
against Y/them', mi-g-e-q'rden-i 'you had propped me up (against X)'
e t c . ; a-k'l-eb 'you reduce X/them for Y/them' => da-v-a-k'el-i(-t) 'I
(we) reduced X/them for Y/them', da-a-k'el-i(-t) 'you (you P1-) reduced
X/them for Y/them', da-a-k'l-o//da-a-k'l-es 'X reduced Y/them for
Z/them//they reduced X/them for Y/them', etc.; čr-i 'you cut X/them' =>
ga-v-c""er-i(-t) 'I (we) cut X/them', g a - č ' e r - i ( - t ) 'you (you P1-) cut
X/them', ga-č'r-a//ga-č'r-es 'X cut Y/them//they cut X/them', etc.).
Some roots with Thematic Suffix -ev and no vowel in the Present
expand the root in the intransitive Aorist Indicative by inserting -e- when
the subject is 1st or 2nd person (e.g. a-kc-ev 'you knock X/them down' =>
i-kc-ev-i 'you fall down' => c'a-v-i-kec-i(-t) 'I (we) fell down', c'a-ikec-i(-t) 'you (you PL) fell down', c'a-i-kc-a/c'a-i-kc-nen 'X/they fell
down').
Some roots that are characterised by the so-called 'markerless passive'
formation and have no vowel in the Present similarly expand the root in the
intransitive/passive Aorist Indicative by inserting -e- when the subject is
1st or 2nd person (e.g. tvr-eb-i 'you get drunk' => da-v-tver-i(-t) 'I (we)
got drunk', da-tver-i(-t) 'you (you PI.) got drunk', da-tvr-a/da-tvr-nen
'X/they got drunk'; h-q'v-eb-i 'you follow X/them' => mi-v-q'ev-i(-t) 'I
(we) followed X/them', mi-h-q'ev-ii-t) 'you (you PL) followed X/them', mih-q'v-a//mi-h-q'v-nen 'X followed Y//they followed X/them'; jg-eb-i
'you eat to satiety' => ga-v-jex-i(-t) [sic] 'I (we) ate to satiety', ga-jex-i(t) [sic] 'you (you PL) ate to satiety', ga-jg-a/ga-jg-nen 'X/they ate to
satiety').","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]"

"16GEORGI AN GRAMMARComparing this non-finite form with the finite v-i-q'av-i 'I was' vs i-q'+o
<= earlier i-q'v-a 'X was', we see that the root is -q'((a)v)- (with v marking 1st person subject, (-)i- an old passive marker 6 , -i an Indicative
exponent for the Aorist tense, and -a/+o the indicator of a 3rd person
singular subject). Readers will see that I have glossed the old passive
marker with such (Series 11 ) forms of the copula as the Subjective Version
vowel, even though, rather arbitrarily, I have glossed what in origin was
the same i-vowel in the Future Sub-Series forms of the copula, which
derive from an old passive of another root meaning 'do, make' (namely
-k(m)n-), as the Passive marker. What then in the Masdar are the
components - o p - and - n - ? An equals-sign (=) is used either where the
script would itself employ a hyphen or to indicate reduplication. A
question-mark applied to a whole word raises doubts as the
acceptability/existence of that word; when applied to an agreement-affix
within a verb, it questions either the presence of that (zero-)affix or
uncertainty as to the implied referent.
The provenance of some examples is stated, but mostly no such source
is quoted. A large number of citations are taken from the illustrative
material in KEGL; most of the rest have been noted by me over the years
from my general reading of, and/or listening to, Georgian; occasionally
simple sentences were made up by myself.
Readers cannot fail to notice the imbalance in the length of the
chapters, with Chapter 4 on verbal morphology representing more than all
the other chapters put together. This is a natural consequence of the fact
that the chief difficulty (and, to the linguist, greatest attraction) of
Georgian resides in the wonderful complexity of the verbal system. I have
endeavoured to give too much rather than too little information on the
various conjugational patterns (to such an extent that I suspect some may
accuse me of unnecessary spoon-feeding). However, as the verb is the
essence of this language, I felt it was important that readers new to the
language should be able to turn up immediately any particular 'screeve' (=
tense-, mood- or aspect-paradigm) and see how any individual sub-class of
verb conjugates therein. I have also tried to give as much guidance as I
could to help readers see and understand the many highways and byways
traversed by individual verb-roots.","[34, 35]"
"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY3394.7.3 Medial Verb Class (sa+ču+aH gvar-is zmn-eb-is k'las-i)
These are a group of verbs which in origin existed only in the Prešent SubSeries; the group includes a whole range of verbs depicting movement, light
and noise (the so-called 'expressives'), as well as weather-terms. The
majority of such verbs are never construed with a direct object, and
indeed in the case of weather-terms like c'vim-s 'it is raining' it may at
first glance seem problematic to identify the referent of even the
obligatory Set A agreement-affix (here -s), though an example such as the
following (with the lexical verb in the Pluperfect and thus manifesting the
typically transitive phenomenon of 'inversion' with its Dative subject) shews
that ca 'sky' can be easily supplied, viz.
gana ca-s
a+m+den-i
u+nd+a (Ø-)e-c'vim-a?
really sky-DAT so.much-NOM should
(it-)IOV-rain-it(PlUP)
'is it really the case that the sky should have rained so much as this?'
Some members of the class may appear with a direct object (e.g.
(Ø-)tamaš-ob 'you are playing' vs čog+burt-s (Ø-Ø-)tamaš-ob 'you are
playing tennis'). However, in ModernGEORGIANthese verbs have acquired
a full set of screeves across the three Series by virtue of borrowing from
variant-forms of their root, specifically, in the words of Shanidze
(1973.§418), they 'turn to the subjective versional form of the active voice
of their very own root in order to fill in their missing forms: cxovrobs,
cxovrobda, cxovrobdes [Prešent and Imperfect Indicatives plus Prešent
Subjunctive of the verb 'live'—BGHÎ but i-cxovrebs, i-cxovra [Future and
Aorist Indicatives of the same verb—BGH]. Today we understand these as
forms of one and the same verb ... but in origin they were different verbs:
i-cxovrebs is the subjective version which has as its neutral version aCXOVrebS ['X makes Y live'—BGH1. But this form of the subjective version isdrained of any versional content by virtue of the fact that it has been
deprived of its direct object and, as a verb that has been left objectless,
has become intransitive. Despite this, it has retained two markers of a
transitive verb, the one syntactic, the other morphological: (a) with IInd
Series forms it takes its subject in the Narrative case ..., (b) forms of the
III rd Series are produced through inversion and, linked to this, its subject
stands in the Dative ... The verb acxovra has both subject and direct
object: k'ot'em k'argad acxovra col-švili ['K'ot'e gave wife and child a good
life'—BGH]. By the way, as direct object the reflexive pronoun tavi is also
possible with it [tavs saca unda vacxovreb ['I shall settle myself down
wherever it proves necessary'—BGH] (Vazha Pshavela, V,6,ll). But what34ØGEORGI AN GRAMMARon earth is the direct object with the subjective versional icxovra man?
['What' did it 'make live'?—seemingly tavi ['itself'—BGH], which was lostt
since it was the one and only [possible object—BGH] and thus easily
understood. Because of the loss of its object the verb lost its transitivity
and thus came to match the Medial and took upon itself the function of
filling the Medial's missing forms. Only its syntactic force in the IInd and
IIIrd Series and the morphological indicator in the III rd Series (inversion)
remind us of its active [sc. voice—BGH] formation'.
This lengthy quote introduces a number of important features that are
characteristic of the Medial Verbs: the Future Indicative (sc. of Medišis
which have no indirect object associated with them; such 'relative' Medišis
will be discussed separately below) is produced by resorting to the
formant-combination i-...-eb, which is taken by Holisky (1981.1)80 as the
defining phenomenon of the Class81, so that the Future Indicatives 'it will
rain' and 'you will play (tennis)' are (?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s and (šog+burt-s)
(Ø-Ø-)i-tamaš-eb; in origin these are active voiced Transitive Verbforms in Subjective Version with an understood reflexive tav-i 'head; self'
as direct object 82 , and as such the Conditional and Future Subjunctive are
formed as would one anticipate for any Transitive Verb with Thematic
Suffix -eb; Series 11 and 111 are then formed from such Transitive Verbforms (almost!) as one would expect, viz. being characterised by, with one
exception, a Weak Aorist Indicative and in all cases an Aorist Subjunctive
in -o, coupled with Ergative subject throughout Series II, and by Inversion
coupled with Dative subject (and, where applicable, Nominative direct
object) in Series III, so that the Aorist Indicatives 'it rained' and 'you
played (tennis)' are (?Ø-)i-c'vim-a and (čog+burt-i) (Ø-Ø-)i-tamaa-e,
whilst the Perfects are (Ø-)u-c'vim-i-?a and (čog+burt-i) g-i-tamaš(n-)i-a; though not stated explicitly, it is clear from the quoted forms that
the Medials do not employ preverbs in the perfective screeves, a fact
which is ascribed by Holisky to their esšentially atelic aspect, which is
incompatible with the basically perfectivising function of the preverbs. I
part company with Shanidze only insofar as he assumes that, once these
forms have been borrowed, they take on the intransitivity of the verbforms to which they act as paradigm-fillers. Writing a traditional grammar
in an age when it would have been highly unusual to operate with more
than a single level of description (for his Fundamentals of the Grammar of
theGEORGIANlanguage first appeared as such in 1953 and even then was
based on a number of revisions dating back to a slimmer 214-page volume
of 193Ø), it was not open to Shanidze to posit the prešence underlyingly of
the original direct object tav-i that he clearly regarded as the motivation
for the Subjective Version in the screeves of the Future Sub-Series and ofVERBAl MORPHOlOGY341Series II (as well as, of course, for the prešence of Inversion in Series III).
We are not today so restricted, and, as I have argued in a number of
places (1983, 1987a, 1989, 1995), it is by taking for granted the esšential
(underlying) transitivity of Medial Verb-forms outside the Prešent SubSeries that one arrives at the most convincing account of the morphosyntax of Medišis and related phenomena. Where we have such forms as
(?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s 'it will rain' or (Ø-)u-c'vim-i-?a 'it apparently rained',
I place a question-mark before the 3rd person morph to shew that there is
no argument external to the verb correlating with it, even though
according to the analysis just advanced I assume that the relevant
argument is prešent underlyingly but obligatorily deleted once the verb's
transitivity has been established and the agreement-markers have been
assigned accordingly.
In addition to not taking preverbs where one would otherwise have
expected them to occur, the other morphological oddity of Medišis resides
in the fact that, even though almost all of them behave like Transitive
Verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb in the Future Sub-Series and Series II, no
Thematic Suffix appears in the Perfect (or in either of the other two
screeves of Series III), but a strange element -n- may optionally be used 83
immediately after the root in all three Series III screeves for those
Medišis whose root-structure does not make the addition of such a nasal
difficult to pronounce. We have already met such a formant, as with the
Transitive root -t'ac-, where the Perfect may be formed normally or with
the aid of this nasal, e.g.
okro-s
kurd-s
ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ac-eb
gold-DAT thief-DAT PREV-PREV-(you-it-)him-snatch-TS(FUT)
xel-i+dan
hand-from
'you will snatch the gold from the hand of the thief'
=> Aorist okro kurd-s ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ac-e xel-i+dan => Perfect
okro kurd-is-tvis
ga-mo-g-i-t'ac-n-i-a/ga-mo-g-i-t'ac-eb-i-a
xel-i+dan. I have suggested elsewhere (1987b) that this nasal may be the
remnant of an earlier formant -in-, just as in Mingrelian one finds exactly
this sequence sometimes turning up in Series 111 of Medials (e.g. Aorist tik (?Ø-)i-ngar-u =GEORGIANman (?Ø-)i-t'ir-a 'X cried' vs Perfect
ti-s
(Ø-)u-ngar-(in-)?u
=GEORGIANm a - s
(Ø-)u-t'ir-(n-)i-?a
'X
apparently cried'), which I related to the Causative formant, arguing that
the Causative may have been employed to reinforce the Transitive status
of the verb-forms in question, just as today one can point to a number of342GEORGI AN GRAMMARcases where the morphological Causative (see 4.8) does not differ in
meaning from the corresponding non-Causative but Transitive form (e.g.
(Ø-Ø-)a-rb-en = (Ø-Ø-)a-rb-en-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to run').
The reason why the Thematic Suffix -eb- itself cannot be used is that its
prešence would entirely alter the meaning. The reason for this is as
follows: outside the Prešent Sub-Series, as we have stated, Medišis borrow
the Subjective Version variant of a form of their root which otherwise is
produced by means of the a-versioniser in combination with the Thematic
Suffix -eb. We, thus, have such pairs as: (Ø-?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will
speak' vs (Ø-Ø-)a-lap'arak'-eb 'you (will) get X/them to speak'. The
former has the Perfect g - i - l a p ' a r a k ' - ( n - ) i - ? a vs Pluperfect g - e lap'arak'-(n-)?a vs III rd Subjunctive g-e-lap'arak'-(n-)o-?s, whereas
the latter has the Perfect g-i-lap'arak'-eb-i-a vs Pluperfect g - e lap'arak'-eb-in-a vs III rd Subjunctive g-e-lap'arak'-eb-in-o-s. And
so, we see that with the Thematic Suffix -eb prešent the verb-form
actually has the meaning of the (pseudo-)Causative from which the Medial
(outside the Prešent Sub-Series) is itself derived.
The one Medial which does not have the Weak conjugation in its Aorist
Indicative is (Ø-Ø-)grjn-ob 'you feel/perceive X/them'. Additionally, this
Medial is one of the exceptions in terms of its Future Sub-Series formation,
for its Future Indicative is (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-ob. Its Series II screeves
conjugate thus:

Pluperfect g-e-grjn-o, III rd Subjunctive g-e-grjn-o-s. Medišis only
ever occur with a 3rd person direct object, and since all Medišis apart
from 'feel' have a Weak Aorist Indicative conjugation ending in -a for a
3rd person singular subject, and since the Pluperfect is formally akin to the
Aorist Indicative, all Medišis apart from 'feel' have Pluperfect ending in -a
(and, of course, III rd Subjunctive in -o-s). To illustrate the full Series II
and 111 paradigms of a 'regular' Medial let us take the verb for 'play (X)':VERBAl MORPHOlOGYAorist Indicative

(Ø-)e-tamaš-(n-)o-tIn the Prešent Sub-Series Medials manifest a number of different
Thematic Suffixes. Given the Prešent Indicative, the Imperfect Indicative
and Prešent Subjunctive are formed as one would expect, except that
where the Prešent Indicative appears to shew the Thematic Suffix -i (as in
(Ø-)t'ir-i 'you cry'), the Imperfect Indicative and Prešent Subjunctive
incorporate -od- and not -d- alone (e.g. (Ø-)t'ir-od-i 'you were crying',
(Ø-)t'ir-od-e 'may you be crying'); indeed, in the Prešent Indicative some
speakers add the Prešent Indicative of the copula when a Medial in -i has
a 1st or 2nd person subject, so that 'cry' conjugates thus:

Perfect g-i-t f ir-(n-)i-a => Pluperfect g-e-t'ir-(n-)a. With direct object,
this root usually means 'mourn = weep for' (e.g. tkven g-t'ir-od-nen 'they
were mourning/weeping for you(Pl.)'), though in the following example we
seem to have more of an internal object (viz. čven-s sa+t'ir+al-s
kart+ul-ad v-(Ø-)t'ir-i-t 'we cry our weeping-ceremony 84 inGEORGIAN');
sometimes the verb is written with an agreement-prefix s- in such cases344GEORGI AN GRAMMAR(e.g. s-t'ir-i-an k'onpederaci-is da+šl+a-s 'they mourn/weep over the
break-up of the confederation'). The pattern of agreement incorporating
1st and 2nd person of the copula as suffix is, however, obligatory in the
Prešent Indicative for the root -c'ux- 'be unhappy, upset' (Future = (Ø?Ø-)i-c'ux-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-c'ux-eb => Perfect g-i-c'ux-(n-)i-?a),

we can quote dug-s 'it boils' => Future (?Ø-)i-dug-eb-s => Aorist (?Ø-)idug-a => Perfect (Ø-)u-dug-(n-)i-?a => Pluperfect
(Ø-)e-dug-(n-)?a.
As a verb containing Thematic Suffix -eb in the Prešent Sub-Series we
have (Ø-)kadag-eb 'you preach' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-kadag-eb => Aorist
(Ø-?Ø-)i-kadag-e => Perfect g-i-kadag-(n-)i-?a => Pluperfect g - e kadag-(n-)?a. In some Medials the i-prefix has spread to the Prešent

Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-e => Perfect g-i-cin-i-?a => Pluperfect g-e-cin-?a.
And for some the root changes shape somewhat as one moves from Prešent
to Future Sub-Series; in such cases the form of the root manifested in the
Future Sub-Series is retained in Series II and III, as in: kr-i-s '(wind)

As examples of Medišis without -eb in the Future Sub-Series we can
quote: (Ø-)st'v-en 'you whistle' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-st , v-en => Aorist (Ø?Ø-)i-st'v-in-e => Perfect g-i-st'v-en-i-?a => Pluperfect g-e-st'v-in?a; (Ø-)pr-en 'you fly' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-pr-en => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-prin-e => Perfect g-i-pr-en-i-?a => Pluperfect g-e-pr-in-?a; da-(Ø-)rbi-x-a+r 'you run around' => FYiture (Ø-?Ø-)i-rb-en => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)irb-in-e => Perfect g-i-rb-en-i-?a => Pluperfect g - e - r b - i n - ? a ; (ØØ-)sc'avl-ob 'you learn X/them' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-i => Conditional
(Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-i-d-i => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-e => Perfect g-i-sc'avl(?n-)i-a => Pluperfect g-e-sc'avl-(?n-)a.
A handful of Medišis have a prefixal passive form in the Prešent SubSeries only (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)varaud-ob 'you suppose X/them' => i-varaud-eba 'it is/may be supposed'86; (Ø-Ø-)grjn-ob 'you feel X/them' => i-grjnob-a 'X is/may be perceived' 87 ; (Ø-Ø-)gul+is+xm-ob 'you mean X/them'
=> i-gul+is+xm-eb-a 'it is meant' 88 ).
In the case of (Ø-)galob 'you hymn, sing' the ob-element is evidently
part of the root, giving Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-galob-eb, Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)igalob-e, Perfect g-i-galob-(n-)i-?a.","[357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364]"
"NON-VERBALMORPHOLOGY63However, it is also found with the plural sense of 'their own', for which the
form tav-ian-t-i exists. A parallel is produced by sxva 'other', from the
Genitive of which is derived sxv-is-i (plural sxv-eb-is-i), which forms
are usually used substantivally in the sense of 'that of another/others'.
The interrogative pronouns vin? 'who?' and ra? 'what?' form the
interrogative possessives v-is-i? 'whose (human)?' and r-is-i? 'whose
(non-human)?' from their Genitives.
All the above behave as normal consonant-final adjectives in terms of
how they agree with their head-nouns and thus need not be illustrated.
3.2.6 Interrogative (k'itx+v+it-i) (Relative (mi+mart+eb+it-i)) Adjectives
The main interrogative adjectives are ra? 'what?', which is only used with
non-human nouns (e.g. ra cxen-i/c'ign-i? what
horse-NOm/book-NOm
'what horse/book?'), though when used in exclamations it is not so
restricted (e.g. ra k'ac-i x-a+r! what.a man-NOm you-be(PRES) 'what a
man you are!'), and romel-i? 'which?', which is used with humans and nonhumans alike (e.g. romel k'ac-s/cxen-s? which man-DAT/horse-DAT
'to
which man/horse?'). In relative clauses with coreferential noun undeleted
for reasons of emphasis both these forms may appear, the noun carrying
the relative marker -c. Whether in interrogative or relative function ra
behaves like any vowel-stem adjective, whilst romel-i behaves like any
consonant-stem adjective.
Other interrogative adjectives are: ro+gor-i? = ra+gvar-i? =
ra+rig-i? = ra+nair-i? 'what kind of?', ro+d+i-ndel-i? 'of what time?',
sada-ur-i? 'of what place?', ra+m+oden+a? = ra+m+xel+a? 'of what
size/amount?', ra+m+den-i? = ra+o+den-i? 'how many?', ra+m+den+
nair-i? = ra+m+den+gvar-i? 'of how many types?'.
3.2.7 Indefinite (gan+u+sa+zgv+r+el+ob+it-i) Adjectives
The two indefinite suffixes are -me, used for non-specific indefinites (i.e.
where the identity is quite unknown), and -ga+c(a), used (more often
without the bracketed -a) for specific indefinites. Adding them to romel-i
we produce romel-i-me 'any (at all)' vs romel-i-ga+c(a) 'some'. The
latter may only be treated as an indivisible whole, which produces the
following declensional patterning for the phrase 'a certain woman':

non-human, the equivalent ra-ga+c(a) could just as easily replace romeli-ga+c(a) (e.g. romel-i-ga+c(a)/ra-ga+c(a) ambav-i 'some business').
The same unchanging pattern is also normal for the non-specific
indefinite, though the Genitive and Instrumental permit an old alternative,
where the suffix is added to the adjective in agreement with its head, as in
the phrase 'any woman':

The three basic negatives ar(a) 'not', ver(a) 'not (potential)' and nu 'not

3.3. Adverbs(zmn+isa+rt-eb-i)3.3.1 Adverbs from Adjectives
To form the adverb from an adjective, the adjective is simply given the
ending of the Adverbial case (e.g. lamaz-i 'beautiful' => l a m a z - a d
'beautifully'; mc'are 'bitter' => mc'are-d 'bitterly'; sa+oc+ar-i 'amazing' =>
sa + o c + r - a d 'amazingly'; sa + u c x o + o 'wonderful' => sa + u c x o + o-d
'wonderfully'; mšven+ier-i 'marvellous' => mšven+ivr-ad 'marvellously',
where we note the alteration in the suffix; met'-i 'more' => met'-ad 'to a
greater extent'; na+k'1+eb-i 'fewer' => na+k'l+eb-ad/na+k'l+eb 'less, to
a lesser extent'; sa-u-k'et-es-o 'best' => sa-u-k'et-es-o-d 'in the best
way, for the best').
In some instances the final dental component of the Adverbial ending is
lost (e.g. čkar-i 'quick' => čkar-a 'quickly'; nel-i 'slow' => nel-a 'slowly';
maġal-i 'high, tall' => maġl-a 'on high, high up'; dabal-i 'low' => dabl-a
'low down').
Future Participles (4.9.3) in the Adverbial case have a special syntactic
function which is explained in 5.2.1.1.
Privative Participles (4.9.4) are also common in the Adverbial case—see
5.2.2.1.2 for the syntax of expressions of the type 'without VERBing'. Quite
frequently in such cases an alternative formation is used. Alongside such
regular forms for verbs in Thematic Suffix -eb- as: ga-u-tav-eb-1-ad
'unendingly'; da-u-jin-eb-1-ad 'without sleeping'; da-u-sven-eb-1-ad
'without resting', u-k'l-eb-l-ad 'without exception' e t c . , one still comes66GEORGIANGRAmmARacross wholly synonymous variants in -iv, which admittedly are less
common today than they once were, such as respectively: ga-u-tav-eb-1iv, da-u-jin-eb-1-iv, da-u-sven-eb-1-iv, u-k'l-eb-l-iv 2
It is not only Privative Participles which manifest this seemingly
Adverbial variant-ending—alongside sxva+per/sxva+p(e)r-ad 'differ­
ently' there is sxva+pr-iv (as well as the pleonastically marked sxva+priv-ad); alongside the opaque mudam 'permanently' there is mudm-iv, on
which are based m u d m - i v - i 'permanent', m u d m - i v - m o k m e d - i
'permanently active' and mudm-iv-oba 'permanence'. It seems to be a
constituent of irgvl+iv 'all around' and si+grj+iv/gasc'vr+iv 'alongside'.
We have mxr-iv 'from the side', marjvn-iv 'to the right' and marcxn-iv
'to the left'. Note also the adjective masobriv-i 'mass-', which produces
the adverb masobriv-ad 'massively, with large numbers'. Very common is
čv+e+ul+ebr-iv 'usually' => čv+e+ul+ebr-iv-i 'usual'.
3.3.1.1 Comparative and Superlative Grades
These are produced from the positive grade in exactly the same way as for
the comparison of adjectives. Analytically the comparative places u+pr+o
before the positive form, whilst the superlative requires the presence of
q'vela-ze 'than all' with or without u + pr + o (e.g. u+pr+o k'arg-ad
'better' vs q'vela-ze (u+pr+o) k'arg-ad 'best'). For synthetic formations,
the Adverbial case of the form in u- -es-i is used (e.g. u-a+r-es-ad
'worse' vs q'vela-ze u-a+r-es-ad/cud-ad 'worst').
3.3.2 Adverbs Not Derived From Adjectives
Sometimes an expression standing in theNOMINATIVEcase functions
adverbially, as in expressions of time mtel-i k'vira '(for) the whole week',
sam-i tve '(for) three months', dge da game 'day and night', mudam dge
= q'ovel dge 'every day'—cf. dg-it-i dge 'from day to day'.
The Dative case also provides a number of adverbs (e.g. dge-s 'today'
<= dge 'day'; c'el-s (= c'1+eul-s) 'this year' <= c'el-i 'year'; šor-s 'far
away'; did xan-s '(for) a long time'; axlo-s 'nearby'; a+k+et+oba-s 'on
the way here', for which the Genitive-Dative combined ending seen in
a+k+et+ob-isa-s is also possible; i+k + it+oba-s/i+k+it+ob-isa-s 'on
the way there'). Irregular Datives in -as are shewn by a+dg+il-i 'place'
and p'ir-i 'face' when they are used to express a location (e.g. a + m
a+dg+il-as 'at this place'; ga+nadgur+eb-is p'ir-as 'on the edge of
extinction')—cf. also a+m c'ut-as 'this minute'.
The Instrumental too provides a number of adverbs (e.g. marjvn-it 'to
the right'; marcxn-it 'to the left'; švid-i c'l-it 'for 7 years'; dg-it 'byNON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY67day', which also exists in the Genitive-Instrumental combination dg-is-it,
cf. dg-it da gam-it = dg-is-it da gam-it 'day and night', cf. dg-is-it
da mz-is-it 'in the light of day', where mze = 'sun'; or+šabat+ob-it 'on
mondays'; ze-v-it 'up/upstairs'; kve-v-it 'down/downstairs'; sa-it?
'whither?'; neb+s-it 'voluntarily' vs u+neb+1+i+e-t 'involuntarily'; ara-sgz-it 'in no way' vs vera-s-gz-it 'in no way (potential)' vs nura-s-gz-it
'in no way (prohibitional)').
Some adverbs contain postpositions (e.g. q'ovel-tvis 'always, forever',
which has -tvis 'for'; q'vel-gan 'everywhere', sxva-gan 'elsewhere',
zog-gan 'in some places' and bevr-gan 'in many places' have -gan 'from';
gušin-c'in 'the day before yesterday'; sa-it-k'en? 'whither?'; sa-i+dan?
'whence?'; ro+de-mde? 'till when?').
multiplicatives are formed by adding -ǰer to the root of a cardinal,
though in the case of ert-i '1' the suffix -xel is more usual (e.g. ertxel/ert-ǰer 'once', or-ǰer 'twice', at-ǰer '10-times', as or-m-oc-da-txut-met'-ǰer '155-times'); -xel is not absolutely excluded from cardinals
other than '1', and the suffix -gzis is also found in parallel with -ǰer (e.g.
ert-gzis 'once', mraval-ǰer/mraval-gzis 'several times').
3.3.2.1 Adverbs of manner
ro+gor? 'how?', j a l + i a n / j l + i e r 'very', jl + iv + s 'with difficulty',
t+i+tk+m+i+s/lam+i+s/k'ina+ga+m (the last with or without ar 'not')
'almost', sul/srul+i+ad/srul+eb+it/mtl+ad/mtl+ian+ad/sa+vs+eb+it
'wholly', p'ir+da+p'ir 'direct(ly), straight ahead', p'ir+uk'u/p'ir+i+k+it 'on
the contrary', tav+da+q'ira/q'ira+mala 'upside down' (cf. q'ira 'headstand'), (p'ir+hik'u+gma 'back to front', uk'u+gma 'inside out, backwards',
mainc(a) 'still, in any case, even so', mainc(a)+da+mainc 'in any case',
sc'ore + d 'precisely, exactly, just', ra + m + den + ad + me 'to a certain
extent', ro+gor+me 'somehow', a+s+e (also found is e+s+e) 'thus, so, like
this', eg+r+e 'like that', i+s+e 'thus, so, like that (yonder)', mas' 'in that
case', maša + sada+me 'thus; that is to say (= e+se i+gi)', tan+da + tan
'gradually', nel=nel+a 'very slowly', albat 'probably'.
3.3.2.2 Adverbs of Reason
ra+t'om? 'why?', a+m+i + t'om 'for this reason', mag+i+t'om 'for that
reason', i+m+i+t'om 'for that (yonder) reason', ra+t'om+gac 'for some
reason'.
3.3.2.3 Adverbs of Negation

"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY
55Ø7This desiderative is not actually quoted as an existing form in the Academy
Dictionary (KEGL), which is why I have prefaced it with a question-mark for this
particular sense — the form may convey any of the meanings 'it is being written
for/to/on me' without difficulty, though in these instances it is classified as a bivalent
I ntransitive.
6
Always assuming that Georgian is correctly described as having such an aspectual
system — for doubts see Rayfield (1994a).
7
For information on the pluraliser - q ' e found in some dialects see the relevant
sections of Tuite (1991) or Tuite (1989).
8
The final i-vowel in these forms is a marker of the indicative mood.
9
Some might prefer suppletion to v-i-xoc-eb-i-t
when the underlying patient is
plural.
10 The only screeves today retaining the voiceless back fricative, which was once the
universal 2nd person subject indicator, are: the Present of the copula = x-a+r(-t)
'you (you Pl..) are', and, for the verb of motion, which is here shewn with the preverb
mo-, the Future Indicative = mo-x-val(-t) 'you (vou Pl.) will come', the Conditional =
mo-x-vid-od-i(-t) 'you (you P1.) would (have) come', the Future Subjunctive ro(m)
mo-x-vid-od-e(-t) 'if you (you(PU) were to come', the Aorist Indicative = m o - x ved-i(-t) 'you (you Pl.) came', and the Aorist Subjunctive = ro(m) mo-x-vid-e(-t)
'in order that you (you Pl.) may come'. ,
11. Changes to the root will be explained at the appropriate time.
12 The following examples come from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo
'Literary Georgia' (3rd
Feb 1989 page 11 and 1st June 1990 page 2 respectively): ra (Ø-)a-dard-eb- t

13 This h- used also to be found before - b , and it sometimes still occurs in this context.
Volume 8 of KEGL, for instance, gives the entry-form é a - h - b a r - d - e b - a PREV3rd.PER-be.entrusted-PASS-TS-X(FUT)
X will be entrused to Y'. The Dictionary of
Morphemes and Modal Elements, published in 1988, also quotes such forms as da-hbzu-i-s 'X buzzes over Y', whereas KEGL volume III, published in 1953, cites this
latter verb without the h - .
14 These two zero-morphs represent respectively 2nd person subject and 3rd person
direct object. I arbitrarily assume throughout this work that the affixal ordering is
subject-direct object-indirect object.
15 The switch in preverb is dealt with below (4.3).
16 In Old Georgian plurals in -n- always imposed their plurality on the verb.
17 There is a homonymous Indirect Verb usually used in conjunction with a negative to
mean 'have' (e.g. ara+per-i ar m-e-bad-eb-a
nothing-NOM not I-I OV-have-TSit(FUT) 'I shall have nothing', which in the Present I ndicative would be m - a - b a d - i a), but in the present instance we are dealing with the dynamic bipersonal passive of
the root -bad- 'give birth'.
18 Masdars are usually construed with the relevant preverb.
19 Both variant-masdars (abstract-nouns) are employed by KEGL in the explanation
offered of the entry-form i-rb-en-s 'X will run', namely: si-rb-il-it i-vl-i-s, r b en-it c'a-va=c'a-mo-va 'X will move about running, X will go and come away
running'.
20 The presence of a 1st or 2nd person direct object with a root that is construed with
mi- does not of course occasion any such substitution (e.g. gvino t'k'b+il-ad mim-a-jin-eb-s 'wine will sweetly lull me to sleep').","[525, 526]"

"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY3934.7.5 Stative Verbs (st'at'ik'+ur-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)
The Stative Verbs are a small and somewhat marginal group of verbs used
to indicate a particular state of their Nominative subject. As the state is
ongoing and unchanging, it is has no natural aim or end-point, and thus
perfective aspect is an inapplicable concept, reflected in the total
morphological abšence of preverbs with such verb-forms. A morphological
peculiarity of Statives, however, is that, whether or not they are bivalent
by virtue of there being a Dative indirect object prešent, the screeves
existing in Series I and 11 are nevertheless bipersonal, though in Series 111
the three screeves will be either monopersonal or bipersonal depending
upon whether the verb in question is monovalent or bivalent respectively.
In the Prešent Sub-Series most Statives possess only the Prešent
Indicative (the Aorist Indicative and Aorist Subjunctive standing in place of
the missing Imperfect and Prešent Subjunctive respectively). Most Statives
only occur with a 3rd person singular subject and usually end in the
morphic sequence -i-a 1 4 4 , where - i - is the Stative Prešent exponent and
-a is the 3rd person subject agreement-suffix, though a few Statives end in
the Prešent in the sequence -av-s. In the Future Sub-Series and in Series
II Statives are formed like prefixal Intransitive Verbs with an obligatory eprefix. The structure of the root and the type of ending in Series 11
screeves (sc. Weak vs Strong in the Indicative, and o- versus a-vowel in
the Subjunctive) is determined by the pattern which is usually
characteristic of the given root when it is functioning non-Statively. In
Series III, however, a monovalent Stative is formed monopersonally just
like any monovalent Intransitive Verb (see the relevant sub-sections of
4.7.2.3) with the Past Participle fused to the appropriate forms of the
copula—sometimes, however, an extra component - e b - is introduced; a
bivalent Stative is formed bipersonally just like any normal bivalent
Intransitive Verb (see the relevant sub-sections of 4.7.2.3) with the Masdar
fused either to the Prešent of the copula in the case of the Perfect or to
the increment -od- plus the endings characteristic of either the Imperfect
or Prešent Subjunctive in the case of the Pluperfect or III rd Subjunctive
respectively—sometimes, however, an extra component - e b - is again
introduced.
In addition to the obligatory indirect object marking with even
monovalent Statives in Series I and 11, one may find a meaningful indirect
object associated with some Statives, thereby making them not only
bipersonal but fully bivalent. Depending upon the verb, this indirect object
will be indicated in the Prešent Sub-Series (which is to say in the Prešent
Indicative) by (i) placing the relevant agreement-prefix immediately in front394GEORGIANGRAMMARof the root, (ii) using the Objective Version, (iii) using the locative Version.
I n the Future Sub-Series and in Series 11, however, there is syncretism of
the monovalent and bivalent forms. let us illustrate by taking the root
-k'id- 'be suspended' (cf. its Transitive Verbal guise in (da-)(Ø-Ø-)k'ideb 'you (will) hang X/them up'): monovalently we have:
surat-i
k'edel-ze h-k'id-i-a
picture-NOM wall-on
?3rd.PER-suspended-PRES.STAT-it
'the picture is hanging on the wall'
vs its bivalent usage in:
p'rezident'-s pex-eb-ze h-k'id-i-a,
ra+m+den-i
president-DAT foot-Pl-on him-hung-PRES.STAT-it how.many-AGR
k'ac-i
mo-k'vd-a
man-NOM PREV-die-3rd.PER(AOR)
'the president doesn't give a damn how many men died'
vs a second type of bivalent usage in:
kal-s
lamaz-i
surat-i
woman-DAT pretty-AGR picture-NOM(Ø-)u-k'id-i-a 145
(her-)OV-suspendedPRES.STAT-itk'edel-ze
wall-on
'the woman has a pretty picture hanging on the wall'
If each of these three šentences is transposed into the future, only one
verb-form will appear in them, and that verb-form is
(Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a146
Again only the one form (Ø-)e-k'id-a will appear if the transposition is to
the past (cf. the Aorist Subjunctive (Ø-)e-k'id-o-s). For the Perfect the
monovalent šentence would include the verb-form k'id-eb-ul-a (cf.
Pluperfect k'id-eb-ul-i-q'+o, I l l r d Subjunctive k'id-eb-ul-i-q'-o-s),
whereas the two bivalent usages would require the selection of the
bipersonal h - k ' i d - e b - i - a (cf. Pluperfect h - k ' i d - e b - o d - a , IIIrd
Subjunctive h-k'id-eb-od-e-s).
Where a Stative is obligatorily construed with a meaningful indirect
object, one feels that the statement being made relates more to this Dative
nominal than to the Nominative one, which raises the question of which of
the two arguments is the subject. For example: kart+v+el-eb-i xom mo(Ø-)i-g-eb-en? ara m-gon-i-a 'theGEORGIANswill win, won't they? I395VERBAl MORPHOlOGYdon't think so = I think not'; vin g-gon-i-v-a+r? somex-i (Ø-)m-gon-ix-a+r 'who do you think I am? I suppose you to be an Armenian'; ra gkv-i-a? gogi m-kv-i-a 'what are you called? My name is Gogi'; ra g-acv-i-a-t? ra-c gv-a-cv-i-a, i+ma-s Coxa h-kv-i-a 'what are you(Pl)
wearing? What we are wearing is called a cherkesska'.
Since the root -k'id- illustrated above permits its Nominative Subject
to be 1st, 2nd or 3rd person, I now set out the full paradigms for this
Stative Verb. I then list with 3rd person subject (and, indirect object for
bipersonal forms) the Prešent Indicative, Future Indicative (FI), Aorist
Indicative (AI), Aorist Subjunctive (AS), plus both monovalent and bivalent
Perfect (MP vs BP) and Pluperfect (MPP vs BPP) (assuming that all these are
found) for at least all the Stative Verbs given by Shanidze (198Ø.315-318) as
existing in ModernGEORGIAN.

This same strategy can be used to indicate a cause within a mainsubordinate clausal sequence, e.g.

'I am afraid of the enemy because (= for the reason that) he threatens

If i+m+it'om is followed by the emphatic particle k'i 'indeed' and the

which the negative negates not the main verb but rather the reason
offered. And so, faced with the sequence mt'r-isa i+m+it'om k'i ar mr

there is a more compelling reason than his mere threats for me to fear the

5.2.2.1.4 Conditional
The regular distinction between real (or vivid, or immediate, or open) and
unreal (or vague, or remote, or closed) conditions can be drawn. They are
distinguished both by the conjunction in the protasis (viz. tu 'if' for the
former vs r o m 'if' for the latter) and by the screeves that can be
associated with these conjunctions.
5.2.2.1.4.1 Real Conditionals
The conjunction tu 'if' usually occupies the first position in the protasis,
although it may also stand after the clause's first constituent. The
appropriate non-SUBJunctive screeve is used in both protasis and apodosis,
and the order of main vs subordinate clause is free, e.g.
tu kux-s,
a+g+re+t+ve
el(+)av-s
if
thunder(PRES)i-t also
lighten(PRES)-it
'If it is thundering, it is also lightening'
tu (?Ø-)i-kux-eb-s,

if (?it-)SV-thunder-TS(FuT)-it also
(?it-)SV-lightenTS(FuT)-it
'If it thunders, it will also lighten'
A peculiarity of real future conditions is that the protasis may contain
not the anticipated Future Indicative but the Aorist Indicative, so that an
alternative to the above would be:
tu (?Ø-)i-kux-a,
a+g+re+t+ve
(?Ø-)i-el(+)v-eb-s

However, if the Conditional is used in both protasis and apodosis, then
the equivalent of an unreal conditional is produced, even though the
conjunction remains tu, e.g.

unexpectedly, tu may combine with the SUBJunctive mood. This

when the speaker is asserting his honesty. The Prešent SUBJunctive is used
for progressive activities in the prešent, the Aorist SUBJunctive for future
events, and the IIIrd SUBJunctive for reference to the past, e.g.

straight-ADV-upto if lie-ADV5.2.2AA.2 unreal Conditionals
unreal conditionals are marked by the conjunction rom, which avoids first
position in the protasis. The apodosis contains a verb in the Conditional,
whilst the protasis will shew the Prešent SUBJunctive for reference to the
prešent, the Future SUBJunctive for reference to the future, and the
Pluperfect Indicative for reference to the past, e.g.","[600, 601, 602, 603, 604]"
"Strive to
(Ø-Ø-)lam-ob 'you strive to' + Masdar or Aorist Subjunctive (if non-past)
or Pluperfect (if past). The verb is limited to the Prešent Sub-Series. It
has the synonyms (Ø-Ø-)cd-il-ob 'you try to' (see below), (Ø-)čkar-ob
'you are in a hurry' (see 4.7.4), (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'rap(v)-i 'you (will) hasten to'
(Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'rap-e, Perfect g-i-sc'rap(v)-i-a; cf. (mo-i-(Ø-Ø-)isc'rap-eb 'you (will) hurry along your X(s)' => Aorist mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-sc'rape, Perfect mo-g-i-sc'rap-eb-i-a).
Equals
The 3rd person form in question is (Ø-)u-dr-i-s, with Imperfect (Ø-)udr-i-d-a (e.g. sir+aklema-s k'vercx-i katm-is oc+da+sam k'vercxs (Ø-)u-dr-i-s 'the egg of an ostrich equals 23 eggs of a chicken').
SoundsIn the šense of 'have a particular quality' the verb is žger-s (e.g. k'argad žger-s ork'est'r-i 'the orchestra sounds good'), which exists in the
Prešent Sub-Series only (Imperfect žger-d-a); in the šense of 'sound out'
we have ga-i-sm-i-s (Imperfect/Conditional in -od-) => Aorist ga-i-sm-a
(no Series III) (e.g. kuča-ši mankan-is gug+un-i ga-i-sm-a 'the roar486GEORGIANGRAMMARof a car sounded (out) in the street').
Appear
čan-s 'it appears/is visible' is usually applied only to inanimate objects and
is thus rarely found with anything other than a 3rd person subject (for
animate entities i-xed-eb-a 'X is visible' seems preferable). However, the
Prešent conjugates thus:
v-čan-v-a+r
v-čan-v-a+r-t
(Ø-)čan-x-a+r (Ø-)čan-x-a+r-t
čan-s
čan-an
Note the common expression ro+gor+c č a n - s 'as it appears,
apparently', for which the simple e+t'q'+ob+a is a synonym. This verb is
restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series, the Imperfect being čan-d-a. The
Objective Version is possible (e.g. zgva-s jir-i ar (Ø-)u-čan-d-a 'the
bottom of the sea was not visible', gogo a+gar
(Ø-)u-šan-d-a-t
amxanag-eb-s 'the girl was no longer visible to (her) friends', bezg +
oba-s mušt'ar-i a+gar+sad (Ø-)u-čan-s 'being a nark no longer has a
client anywhere'). With preverb m o - the verb means 'be visible from
somewhere' (e.g. šor+s gor-is cixe mo-šan-s 'the fortress of Gori is
visible a long way off).
A zero-grade of the root appears in the suffixal passive (ga-)(Ø-)čnd-eb-i (Aorist ga-(Ø-)čn-d-i, Perfect ga-(Ø-)šen-il-x-a+r) 'you (will)
appear, come into existence, be created, suddenly reveal yourself', e.g.

With other preverbs we have ga-mo-c5n-d-eb-a 'it will be revealed'
and ag-mo-šn-d-eb-a 'it will be discovered, will appear from below'.
The e-grade of the root seen in the Series III screeves of these suffixal
Intransitives is also found in their Transitive counterparts (in all cases the
radical - e - becomes - i - in Series II): (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-čen 'you (will) create
X/them', (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-čen = (rarer) (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-šin-eb 'youVERBAl MORPHOlOGY487(will) reveal X/them', (ag-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-čen 'you (will) discover X/them'
(cf. (Ø-Ø-)i-čen tav-s 'you (will) reveal/shew yourself/pop up'), (mi-/
mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-čen 'you (will) apportion/set aside X/them for Y/them'.
Does this root exist in e- a- i-, and zero-grades, or is the root - č alone, which then combines with a variety of clearly related suffixes?
Be satisfied with a little
As a dynamic form we have (da-)(Ø-)s-jer-d-eb-i 'you (will) find
contentment in X (Dative)' (Aorist da-(Ø-)s-jer-d-i, Perfect da-(Ø-)sjer-eb-i-x-a+r) = (da-)(Ø-)k'ma+q'+op+il-d-eb-i, with which latter
verb the oblique object is in the Instrumental case (e.g. cot'a m-a-kv-s,
cot'a-s v-(Ø-)jer-d-eb-i = cot'a-ti v-k'ma+q'+op+il-d-eb-i 'I have
little, I find contentment in a little 269 ', whereas the stative equivalent is
(Ø-)s-jer-i-x-a+r, found only in the Prešent Sub-Series, (e.g. ara m-akv-s did-i sc'avl+a da mcire-sa v-(Ø-)jer-i-v-a+r 'I don't have
great learning and I am content with a small amount').

From the adjective tana+xma 'agreed' (lit. 'of fellow voice') we have: (i)
(da-)(Ø-)tan+xm-d-eb-i (=> Aorist da-(Ø-)tan+xm-d-i => Perfect d a (Ø-)tan+xm-eb-ul-x-a+r)
= (da-)(Ø-)q , abul-d-eb-i (=> Aorist d a (Ø-)q'abul-d-i => Perfect da-(Ø-)q'abul-eb-ul-x-a+r) 'you (will) agree',
(ii) (da-)(Ø-)s-tan+xm-d-eb-i (=> Aorist d a - ( Ø - ) s - t a n + x m - d - i =>
Perfect da-(Ø-)s-tan+xm-eb-i-x-a+r) = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-tan+xm-eb-i

agree with you'.
For 'be in agreement' we have: r - i s a - m e
tana+xma/q'abul-i x-a+r = q'abul-sa x-a+r = ra-me-ze q'abul-i ga-kv-s = the Medial Verb (Ø-?Ø-)q , abul-ob (e.g. maga-s ro+gor+ga+c
advil-ad (?Ø-)q'abul-ob-d-a čven-i p'et're 'somehow our P'et're was
easily in agreement with that'), for which last verb the Future = (Ø-Ø-)iq'abul-eb, the Aorist = (Ø-Ø-)i-q'abul-e, the Perfect = g-i-q'abul(eb-)i-a.
Participles for š t a n + x m - e b - a 'agreeing, agreement' are: Active šem - t a n + x m - e b - e l - i 'appeasing', Future še-sa-tan+xm-eb-el-i 'for
agreement', Privative še-u-tan+xm-eb-el-i (all with syncopating suffixal488GEORGIANGRAMMARvowel), Past še-tan+xm-eb-ul-i.
Be better, preferable, superior
Statively we have s-job-s (also s-job-i-a or, less commonly, s-job-i-s),
found only in the Prešent Sub-Series (e.g. xerx-i s-job-i-a gone-sa, tu
k'ac-i mo-(Ø-)i-gon-eb-sa 'wile is better than might, if a person thinks
one up'). A kind of Future is provided for the above by the form (Ø-)ajob-eb-s, e.g

'it will be better, I think, if you look to yourself' (or 'that you look to

and from this we have the Conditional seen in: sa+rč+o mi-(Ø-)e-mat'eb-in-a, i+s ar (Ø-)a-job-eb-d-a? 'would it not have been preferable
for X to have increased the food?'. Dynamically the form is (Ø-)s-job+n-i
'you gain the upper hand over X/them' => Future (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-job-eb,
Aorist (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-job-e, Perfect g-i-job-eb-i-a/g-i-job-n-i-a -tvis

mainc čven v-(Ø-)job+n-i-d-i-t 'the Prussians were fighting (like men)
possessed, but we stIII began to get the better of them'). The Stative form
is sometimes used like the Dynamic (viz. maq'vl-is k'rep+a-ši vera+vin
s-job-d-a sopo-sa 'in the picking of blackberries no-one could outdo
Sopo'). The Active Participle of the Dynamic form is m-job-i/m-job+ni/m-job+n-e(l-i), of which the first variant is found in the comparative u m+job-es-i 'better', which in turn provides the root for (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)au+m+job+es-eb 'you (will) improve X/them' and (ga-)(Ø-)u+m+job+esd-eb-i 'you (will) improve'.
Jump
For 'jumping up and down' the verb only exists in the Prešent Sub-Series,
and it is (Ø-)xt'-i 'you jump up and down' (Imperfect (Ø-)xt'-od-i). For a
single jump in some specific direction the common Prešent Indicative is
(Ø-)xt'-eb-i (Imperfect (Ø-)xt'-eb-od-i), the directionality being shewn
in the perfective screeves by the chošen preverb (e.g. a-(Ø-)xt'-eb-i 'you
will jump up' => Aorist a-(Ø-)xt'-i => Perfect a-(Ø-)m-xt'-ar-x-a+r).","[504, 505, 506, 507]"

40GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
The natural order in English is of course here to have hither- followed by thitherorientation.
For the Dative in this quote from Vazha Pshavela cf. 5.1.1.5 (g).
The 3rd person subject-affix for this verb-form (sc. with any preverb) is actually zero
as a result of the historical accident which saw the disappearance of material from
the original end of the word, which was in Old Georgian da-val-s , where -s was the
subject-suffix.
Note the plural verb-form though the subject is inanimate in this example from KEGL
Quoted by the Dictionary of Morphemes as da-h-mger-i-s .
The 1953 edition is not accessible to me.
Forms such as (a-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (gada-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (ga-)(0-0-0-)at'an, (mo-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an (for which see the final paragraph of 4.4.4) are basically
Locative Versional forms, for which see also 4.4.4. Note also the difference in the
formation of the Perfect for the Subjective vs Locative Versional forms of this root
(e.g. a-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you (have) apparently endured X/them' vs a-g-i-t'an-eb-i-a
'you (have) apparently gone up and reached').
Cf. the Indo-European so-called Dative of Interest seen in this Latin example from
Livy: militanti in Hispania pater eimoritur 'while he was serving [sc. Historic Present]
in Spain, his father died', though, unlike Georgian, Latin verbs agree only with the
subject argument.
This is the Georgian translation (Danelia and Tsanava, 1991.47) of the Mingrelian
osur-i giti-o-bs-әn-d- ә il ndem-c from one of the texts originally published by
Q'ipshidze (1914).
KEGL does not quote the Subjective Versional form of this verb for the allomorph
with an r root-finally.
N.B. (Ø-)g-i-sm-en-t 'I am listening to you (sc. to what you have to say)' with
Objective Version, which is the standard opening gambit (a) when answering the
phone or (b) for a waiter coming to take a customer's order.
The use of this verb with 'head' as direct object in the colloquial sense of 'cause
shame to' necessitates the absence of versioniser (e.g. b i č - m a ojax-sa-c tav-i
mo-(0-)s-č'r-a da čven-s sopel-sa-c
'the lad brought shame both to the family
and to our village').
Note how this passive idea is conveyed by an active verb with non-referential 3rd
person plural subject.
In verbs of this type the 'prescriptive' periphrasis that would change a 1st or 2nd
person direct object into the 3rd person phrase 'my/our/your head' in the presence
of a 3rd person indirect object tends to be ignored.
There is also (mi-)(0-0-)i-p , at , iz'-eb .
Two Modern Georgian versions shew here the root - p ' q ' r - 'turn, direct' with
Locative Version outranking the Subjective because of the (actual or implied)
presence of an appropriate indirect object (viz. zeca-d ag-(0-?0-)a-p'q'r-o tvaln-i vs ca-s rni-(0-0-)a-p'q'r-o tval-eb-i).
Seen also in an ancient participle a+dg+il-i, now nominalised as 'place'.
Prescriptive grammar suggests that when the direct object is plural the root becomes
-xoc-, as in (Ø-Ø-)xoc-av 'you kill them'.
In a number of compounds such as this the noun jvar-i does not syncopate (cf.
me+jvar+e 'wedding-witness'), but when used in isolation it does syncopate (cf. the
Genitive jvr-is ).
The element -n(i) here is the Mingrelian equivalent of the Georgian subordinator
rom. If we transpose the Mingrelian system completely here into Georgian, an
imperfective Conditional will be achieved simply by putting the auxiliary into its
Conditional form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-a), whilst an imperfective Future Subjunctive will
result if the auxiliary is placed in its Future Subjunctive form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-e-s).","[526, 527]"

The formation of screeves for Transitive and Intransitive Verbs will be
given according to a division based on Thematic Suffix—roots which do not
accommodate a Thematic Suffix are called Root Verbs, though one might
equally style them Athematic.
Sometimes a change of preverb does not alter the lexical meaning of
the verbal complex but introduces a special nuance. For example, the
preverb da- often substitutes for a root's usual preverb if some notion of
plurality is involved, most simply seen in the following example where a
singular subject is replaced with a plural, viz. k'vercx-i ga-laq'-d-a
egg-NOM PREV-addled-become-it(AOR)
'the egg became addled' vs
k'vercx-eb-i da-laq'-d-a egg-Pl-NOM
PREV-addled-become3rd.PER(AOR)
'the eggs became addled'. In the following case the
replacement-preverb reduces the effect of the verbal action, viz. k'ar-i
ga-v-(Ø-)a-g-e door-NOM PREV-I-(it-)NV-open-INDIC(AOR) 'I opened
the door' vs k'ar-i še-v-(Ø-)a-g-e 'I opened the door ajar', cf. kal-i
ga-suk-d-a woman-NOM PREV-fat-becomeshe(AOR)
'the woman grew
fat' vs kal-i mo-suk-d-a 'the woman put on a little weight'.
Suppletion exists. It may be determined by (a) screeve (Sub-)Series (e.g.
v-(Ø-)amb-ob I-(X-)say-TS(PRES) 'I say X' vs v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i I-(X-)SVsay-lNDlC(FUT) 'I shall say X' vs v-(Ø-)tkv-i I-(X-)say-INDIC(AOR) 'I
said X'—sometimes alteration to a verb's classification combines with
suppletion as in the case of what is formally the Intransitive Prešent ra-s
(Ø-Ø-)Svr-eb-i? what?-DAT (you-it-)do-TS-INDIC(PRES) 'what are you
doing?' becoming the Transitive Future ra-s (Ø-Ø-)i-zam? what?-DAT
(you-it-)SV-do(FUT) 'what will you do?' or again the Transitive Aorist ra
(Ø-Ø-)ken-i? what(NOM) (you-it-)do-INDIC(AOR) 'what did you do?';

'the/a child is lying on the bed'
With bivalent Intransitive Verbs sometimes it is the Nominative
argument which corresponds to the subject, e.g.
q'vela
a+ma-s
(Ø-)e-c'ina+ag+m+deg-eb-a
all(NOM) this-DAT (it-)IOV-oppose-TS-3rd.PER(PRES)
'everyone opposes this'126GEORGIANGRAMMARwhereas at other times it is the Dative nominal which fulfils this function,
e.g.
kal-s
šv+il-i
tan
(Ø-Oe-q'+ol-eb-a
woman-DAT child-NOM along (she-)IOV-have-TS-it(FUT)
'the woman will have her child with her'
Occasionally one and the same verb-form permits both interpretations
(e.g. the Nominative is the subject of the first verb in this proverb:
zgva-s
(Ø-)e-rid-eb-od-a,
cvar-ma
sea-DAT (it-)IOV-avoid-TS-IMPERF-X
dew-ERG
da-(Ø-)a-xr<5-o-o
PREV-(X-)NV-drown-it(AOR)-SP.PART
'X was avoiding the sea (but) it was the dew that drowned him, as they
say'
whereas it is the Dative that is subject in:
šen
nu
(mo-)g-e-rid-eb-a!
you(DAT) not(PROH) (PREV-)you-I OV-be.shy-TS-X(PRES)
'don't you be shy (sc. of doing X)!')
Some formally intransitive (deponent) verb-forms are construed with
what appears to be a direct object, e.g.
e + s xe
k ' a r g vašl-eb-s
(?0-)i-jl-ev-a
this tree(NOM) good apple-Pl-DAT (?3rd.PER-)PASS-give-TS-it
'this tree gives good apples'

(?Ø-Ø-)e-pic-eb-od-nen
(?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)I OV-swear.to-TS-I MPERF-they
'the girl and boy were swearing to each other their love'
If such verb-forms exist in Series II, where a normal direct object
would stand in the Nominative, whilst the indirect object remains Dative,
prescriptive grammar (to which speech does not always conform—see 5.1.7)
requires that such nominals remain Dative, e.g.
mo+nadir+e
hunter(NOM)mgvdel-s
priest-DATmo-(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'v-a
PREV-(?it-him-)OV-relate.to-he(AOR)VERBAl MORPHOlOGY127tav+is tav+gada+sa+val-s
own
adventure-DAT
'the hunter related to the priest his own adventure'
Some verb-forms are formally two-person Intransitives though
monovalent by virtue of being construed with only a single Nominative
argument. This state of affairs characterises Series I and II, but, if the
verb possesses forms for the Series 111 screeves, these often revert to
being formally monopersonal, e.g.
pr+in+v+el-i mic'a-ze
ga-(?0-)e-rtx-m-eb-a /

'the bird will flop/flopped/has flopped down on the ground'
Sometimes not all screeves exist for a given type of verb. In these
cases either a gap exists or the missing screeve is filled by a variant-form
of the root in question; alternatively, suppletion might occur. These
together with all the other morphological particularities and peculiarities of
theGEORGIANverbal system will be described later in this chapter.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"

5.2.2.3.3. Potential
By the term 'potential' I mean clauses dependent upon introductory
expressions like 'must, ought, should, want, advise, try, be able, necessary,
possible, preferable, e t c . ' . If a finite reprešentation is required, then
where the proposition relates to the future, the Aorist SUBJunctive is used;
where it relates to the prešent, the Prešent SUBJunctive is used; where it
relates to the past, the Pluperfect is used. The complementiser rom is
optional. The Masdar serves as the non-finite reprešentation in such
expressions.
The 3rd person Prešent of the verb 'want' (u-nd-a) has been
grammaticalised as the invariant particle of obligation. Prescriptively,
nothing can stand between it and its dependent finite verb—in other words,
rom is never used in this expression, e.g.
male u+nd+a

'I must go soon'c'a-[v-jvid-e
PREV-[I-jgo-AOR.SUBJShould u-nd-a be functioning as the 3rd person Prešent of 'wish', then
rom is optional and other material too may separate main from subordinate

host-DAT
(he-)OV-want-it
The host wants me to go soon'(rom) male c'a-[v-jvid-e

the Aorist SUBJunctive, e.g.

host-DAT
(he-)OV-want-it

There is a somewhat parallel division between invariant še+i+jl+eb+a
'it is possible' (še+i+jl+eb+od+a 'it was possible') and conjugated š e (Ø-)u-jl-i-a 'X can Y' (še-(Ø-)e-)l-o 'X could Y'), e.g.

where the words ar še+i+jl+eb+a may be replaced by the privative

Originally full verb-forms (viz. (Ø-)e-g-eb-i-s/(Ø-)e-g-eb-a, i-kneb-a—cf. 3.6.14), today the particles e+g+eb, i+kn+eb are used in the

it is easy to see how the particles could become re-interpreted as

N.B. the ordering of the affixes on this particular verb, the complex of Set B +
Objective Versioniser preceding the Set A subject-affix.
8 While the presence here of the Pluperfect Indicative may seem synchronically
unusual, there is a simple historical explanation. This screeve arose out of the Aorist
Indicative, and in Old Georgian the Aorist Indicative was often employed in
conjunction with the now defunct particle -mca, whose function was to switch from
the indicative's factuality to counter-factuality, in which role it is oddly reminiscent of
Ancient Greek's particle 'αv (Homeric KΕ(V)—cf. the relevant lemma in Liddell and
Scott's Greek-English Lexicon). As the Pluperfect was developing, the particle at
first occurred with it in the construction under review. When the particle became
obsolete, the Pluperfect was left alone to function as the verbal marker of past
purpose-clauses. In some dialects (such as Rač'an) the IIIrd Sujunctive has taken over
this function by analogy with the use of the Present/Aorist Subjunctives in non-past
clauses of purpose.
9 In the original from a work by Shio Mgvimeli the conjunction is absent.
10 For a discussion of this element see Hewitt (1991).
11 In an earlier discussion of this construction (1987.159-16Ø) I suggested that an
alternative to the optionally negated Future Indicative was the positive Future
Subjunctive, for which I quoted the one example to hand, which was from Roman
Miminoshvili's translation of Homer's Iliad, namely:
gem+ban-ze da-v-dg-e-t,
sa+na+m
game
mooring-at
PREV-lst.PER-stand-AOR.SUBJ-PL
until
night(NOM)
ča-mo-c'v-eb-od-e-s
PREV-PREV-fall-TS-IMPERF-FUT.SUBJ-it
The Greek original (as well as the Latin and English translations I have consulted)
make it clear that the sense here should be that of 'until'—the Greek reads:
whilst the Latin is: anchoris stabiliamus, donec venerit nox intempesta, both of which
give the English 'Let us hold fast at the moorings until the beneficent night comes (in
the hope that during it the Trojans may cease from hostilities and we may then be
able to drag down all our ships)'. However, in view of the fact the Georgian main
clause contains not a stative but a dynamic verb (viz. da-v-dg-e-t 'let us take up
position' rather than v-i-dg-e-t 'let us stay in position'), I am no longer absolutely
convinced that the above example permits any interpretation other than 'Let us come
to a haltat the moorings before night falls', unless, of course, one is to understand 'Let
us come to a halt at the moorings {and remain there) until the night falls'.

15 An explanation for this collocation might lie in such Old Georgian constructions as the
following, where the precursor of the modern subordinating conjunction functioned
adverbially (= 'thus') as part of the main clause (viz. (Ø-)i-t'q-od-a vitar: mo-val-s
u+jl+ier+es-i čem-sa (it-)SV-say-IMPERF-X thus PREV-come-Y stronger-NOM meDAT'X said that one stronger than him would come' (Mark 1.7, ms. O).
l6 The Old Georgian here reads (mss. AB): m-e-âin-i-s, nu-uk'ue gan-(0-)rq'un-ne-s gon+eb+a-n-i tkuen-n-i I-IOV-fear-PRES-it,
not(PROH)-already
PREV(3rd.PER-)corrupt-PL-AOR.SUBJ-it[=snake] thought-PL-NOM your(PL.)-PL-NOM.

The Old Georgian is: m-e-šin-i-s, nu-uk'ue mo-vid-e da ara vitar-ca=i+gi m e
m-neb-av-s g-p'ov-n-e tkuen I-IOV-fear-PRES-it not(PROH)-already PREV-comeAORSUBJ(lst.PER)
and not how-REL=DEM I (DAT) I-wish-TS-it
you-find-PLAOR.SUBJ you(PL.NOM) 'I am afraid lest I come and find you not as I wish'.
18 N.B. the split ara...ra flanking the verb in place of the more usual ara-per-i. The
split variant is, of course, standard in the traditional opening of fairy-tales: i-q'+o da
ara i-q'+o ra 'there was and there was nothing = once upon a time'.
19 The indicative mood is not impossible with this introductory verb (e.g. še+i+jl+eb+a
(Ø-Ø-)i-c-i-t 'it is possible you(PL) know...'; še+i+jl+eb+a c'a-vid-a 'it is possible X
has gone'.
20 Note the rare preverbless Pluperfect in this example, the lack of - n - in the suffixal
component being found in some dialects (the author here, Davit K'ldiashvili, came from
Imereti in W. Georgia), the result of which is to make the Pluperfect more like the
Perfect, which here would be (ga-)(0-)u-k'et-eb-i-a.","[645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655]"
"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY489KissThe usual word for 'kiss(ing)' is k'oc+n+a, though ambor-i is also possible.
Both roots occur in verb-forms, the latter as a bivalent Intransitive verb in
Series I and II alone (viz. (Ø-Ø-)e-ambor-eb-i 'you (will) kiss X/them' =>
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-ambor-e). From the former we have the Transitive (ØØ-)k'oc+n-i 'you kiss X/them', defined by KEGl as t'uč-eb-it (Ø-Ø-)ex-eb-i 'you touch X/them with the lips'. The verb-form defined by KEGl
as t'uč-eb-s š ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) a - x - e b 'you will bring the lips into contact
with X/them' is (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-k'oc-eb, which thus seems to serve as more
of a Future 'you will kiss X/themio'- In Series II both forms of the root
are used (e.g. megobr-eb-ma mraval-i (Ø-)k'oc+n-es 'the friends
kissed a lot' and me+p+e-m šubl-ze (?Ø-Ø-)a-k'oc-a giorgi-s 'the
king kissed Giorgi on the forehead', mo-(Ø-)di, (?Ø-)g-a-k'oc-o 'come
here, let me give you a kiss'). But in Series III only the allomorph in final
+n- is found, giving the Perfect g-i-k'oc+n-i-a. This allomorph may be
used with a number of preverbs and in Objective Version (e.g. kal-ma
q'vela da-(Ø-)k'oc+n-a 'the woman kissed everybody', deda-m tvaleb-i da-(Ø-)m-i-k'oc+n-a 'mother kissed my eyes', bavšv-eb-i da-(ØØ-)m-i-k'oc+n-e 'kiss the children for me', m-i-nd-a p'ir-i gada-v-(ØØ-)k'oc+n-o i+m mšven+ier kal-s 'I want to plant kisses over the
face/mouth of that beautiful woman'). In the Prešent Sub-Series alone we
have the Intransitive seen in: mze i-k'oc+n-eb-a gim+il-it 'the sun
kisses with a smile'. The Causative is (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'oc+n-in-eb 'you (will)
get X/them to kiss Y/them', but KEGl quotes the following example, which
is odd by virtue of having two Dative nominals: ne+p+e=ded+op+al-s
(?Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k , oc+n-in-es ert+man+et-s 'they got the bridal couple to
kiss each other'.
For participles we have: Active m-k'oc+n-el-i, Future sa-k'oc+n-i,
Past da-k'oc+n-il-i '(much-)kissed'.
Own, Belong to
'X belongs to you' = 'you own X/them' is expressed by the bipersonal
prefixal Intransitive g-e-k'ut+v+n-i-s => Future g-e-k'ut+v+n-eb-a (no
Series II or III), gan-g-e-k'ut+v+n-eb-a (Aorist gan-g-e-k'ut+v+n-a
=> Perfect gan-g-k'ut+v+n-eb-i-a) is used either as a dynamic Future 'X
will come into your possession' or sometimes as an equivalent to the stative
Prešent g-e-k'ut+v+n-i-s.
mo-g-e-k'ut+v+n-eb-a 'X will come into
your possession/be assigned/ascribed to you' (vs. mi-(Ø-)e-k'ut+v+neb-a 'X will come into Y's possession/be assigned/ascribed to Y') has the
Transitive equivalent (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'ut+v+n-eb 'you (will)
award/assign/ascribe X/them to Y/them'. Cf. sa-k'ut-ar-i 'own (Adj.)', sa-490GEORGIANGRAMMARk'ut-r-eba = k'ut+v+n-il-eba 'possessionis)'.
Special Verbs in -ob
There is a small group of verbs containing Thematic Suffix -ob in the
Prešent Sub-Series only, which element is preceded by the past participial
formant -ul- (or -il-). All verbs in -ul-ob are Transitive and in the
Future Sub-Series and Series II incorporate the Subjective Version in their
simplest forms, with inversion in Series III. Clearly there are similarities
here with the Medials, and this feeling is reinforced by the prešence of an
optional element -n- in some of the following Series III screeves:
(Ø-Ø-)g-eb-ul-ob 'you receive X/them regularly' contrasts with (ØØ-)i-g-eb 'you receive X/them on a specific occasion'. However, outside
the Prešent Sub-Series only one set of forms exists = Future mi-(Ø-Ø-)ig-eb, Aorist = mi-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e, Perfect = mi-g-i-g-i-a.
(Ø-Ø-)g-eb-ul-ob 'you hear about X/them regularly' is a less common
parallel to the above with its alternative for specific occasions (Ø-Ø-)i-geb (Future = ga-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-eb, Aorist = ga-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e, Perfect ga-gi-g-i-a).
(Ø-Ø-)k,itx-ul-ob
'you read/ask about/ask X/them' => Future (ØØ-)i-k'itx-av (or plus preverb c ' a - for 'read') => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)ik'itx-e 270 (or plus preverb c'a- for 'read') => Perfect g-i-k'itx-av-s (or
plus preverb c'a- for 'read'). Other forms of the root include: (Ø-Ø-)hk'itx-av 'you (will) ask X/them something' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-)h-k'itx-e,
Perfect g-i-k'itx-av-s -tvis); (še-)(Ø-Ø-)e-k'itx-eb-i 'you (will) ask

m o - ( Ø - Ø - ) h - k ' i t x - a v an archaic form meaning 'you will seek
explanation/demand X/them from Y/them'; mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'itx-av 'you will
make an enquiry (on meeting) of X/them' or in the I mperative mo-(Ø-Ø-)ik'itx-e šen-eb-i 'Give salutation to your folk' and mo-(Ø-Ø-)m-i-k'itxe-t tkven-eb-i 'Give my regards to your(Pl) folk'; mo-/mi-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)ak'itx-av 'you will come/go somewhere to ask after X/them'; (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)

i-k'itx-av 'you will examine/take pity on X/them' => gan-u-k'itx-avad/gan-u-k'itx-v-el-ad 'inconsiderately, unpityingly'; (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'itxeb 'you (will) get X/them to read Y/them', and, although (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'itxv-in-eb may also be used in this šense, this latter is strictly the Causative
of 'ask' (e.g. babua-m mezobel-s šv+il+i+šv+il-is ambav-i (Ø-Ø-)ak'itx-v-in-a 'the grandfather got (his) neighbour to enquire about (his)
grandchild's business'). Participles are: Active m-k'itx-v-el-i (cf. m k'itx-av-i 'clairvoyant'), Future sa-k'itx-(av-)i 'question, problem, for

Translation1. The husband will affectionately look at his wife in the eyes, and the
wife will boldly look him in the eye and clasp to her bosom her tiny,
innocent babe—she will be afraid that her husband might snatch this
happiness from her hand. 2. A mother is a selfish creature! 3. She is
jealous of affection towards the child even on the part of her husband; she
wants no-one to share in this property... 4. Eh, my dear, divide your
wealth in two; don't be greedy, oh happy mother, the child is yours, no-one
can snatch it away from you. 5. Why does it upset you that the father too
should shew affection towards his own child? 6. Are you not fortunate too
in that—what would just once be?—not even once have you felt a pang of
hatred for your child, whereas I know of a mother from whose lips the
fatal sin «What an unhappy day it was when you came into my life!» has
fallen more than once. 7. You say that the mother who said this should be
strung up. 8. Eh, kind person, do not so precipitately judge a human being!
9. She is an unwedded mother. 1Ø. Yes, that mother is an unwedded
mother, and so hold on, kind person, do not start judging the guilty one so
hurriedly! 11. Only he who rather searches for evidence that favours the
accused makes a good judge, and I do not want that a good mother should
be a bad judge...4. ras mortulxar šavad, čemo dedao? 'Why have you dressed in
black, mother of mine?' Ietim Gurdzhi (1875-194Ø) was a popular balladeer
in the Old Tbilisi tradition of minstrelsy; there are frequent references in
his work to his distinguished 18th century Armenian predecessor
Sayatnova, who composed verses in Armenian,GEORGIANand Azeri.
Recurring themes are those of love and the futility of earthly existence. In
this poem the line-ending o-vowel in the last three lines of verse one and
the final a-vowel in verse three have no grammatical value and are
prešent purely for metrical reasons. The final a-vowel in verse two can be
regarded as marking the long form of the Adverbial case, though the only
motivation for its prešence is again metrical. The poem is taken from
pp.300-301 of volume 16 (1985) of the series 'GEORGIANPoetry' (Tbilisi,
Nak'aduli).

As stated earlier, the usual formation of the passive/intransitive form
for verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb and containing a vowel in the root is to
employ the suffix -d-. However, when a passive/intransitive is produced
from a causative, the formation is of the prefixal type. Some monopersonal
intransitives produced from Causatives, which are restricted to the Prešent
Sub-Series, may be bivalent (i.e. deponents) (e.g. xel-eb-s (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'vrev + i n - e b - i 'you flail (your) arms around', which is more or less
synonymous with the passive/intransitive Causatives (Ø-)i-rt'q'-m-ev+ineb-i and (Ø-)i-cem-in-eb-i 'you hit out'). Where the prefixal formation
is bipersonal, the meaning is regularly (sc. insofar as these forms can be
considered regular) 'get oneself VERBed by XI O'. where one could, of
course, use the equivalent active voice Transitive in association with the
appropriate reflexive. Consider the following examples (from Shanidze
1973.362): mgel-s (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)e-t'ac-eb-in-eb-i = mgel-s (ga-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-t'ac-eb-in-eb (àen-s) tavs 'you (will) have yourself snatched
away by the wolf' => Aorist mgel-s (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)e-t'ac-eb-in-e = mgel-s
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'ac-eb-in-e (äen-i) tavl => Perfect mgel-s (ga-)
(Ø-)s-t'ac-eb-in-eb-i-x-a+r
= mgl-is-tvis ga-g-i-t'ac-eb-in-eb-ia (šen-i) tav-i; ( Ø - Ø - ) e - c e m - i n - e b - i = ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) a - c e m - i n - e b
(šen-s) tav-s 'you (will) allow X/them to hit you' (see under Root Verbs
below); (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)e-kVl-ev+in-eb-i = (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'vl-ev+ineb (šen-s) tav-s 'you (will) allow X/them to kill you'; (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-trev-in-eb-i = (mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-tr-ev-in-eb (šen-s) tav-s 'you (will)

'you (will) allow X/them to curse you'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)e-šv-eb-in-eb-i =
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-šv-eb-in-eb (šen-s) tav-s 'you (will) get X/them toVERBAl MORPHOlOGY411release you'.
In the case of uc'in čven a+m+den-i ar gv-e-xd-ev+in-eb-od-a
'in the past we were not made to pay so much as this' we have the true
passive of uc'in čven a+m+den-s ar
(Ø-)gv-a-xd-ev+in-eb-d-nen
'previously they used not to make us pay so much as this'.
Thematic Suffix -eb
The Thematic Suffix is retained, to which is suffixed -in-, as in: (ga-)(ØØ-)a-k'et-eb 'you (will) do/make X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'et-eb-ineb 'you (will) get X/them to do/make Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-šv-eb
'you (will) release X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-šv-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to release Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)i-g-eb 'you (will) learn/understand
something' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-g-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to
learn/understand something'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c , q , -eb 'you (will) begin
X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'q'-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to begin
Y/them'; N.B. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-vic , q , -eb 'you (will) put X/them out of your
mind' => (da-i-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-vic'q'-eb(-in-eb) 'you (will) get X/them to
forget Y/them'; N.B. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-ma+xs+ov+r-eb 'you (will) recall
X/them to mind' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-ma+xs+ov+r-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to recall Y/them to mind'.
The verb for 'locating' (viz. (mi-/mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-eb 'you (will)
locate X/them') is a verb with Thematic Suffix -eb but (prescriptively at
least) with the peculiarity that it is construed with a subject and indirect
object of the entity located. We have seen, however, that there are
examples where the construction is regularised to conform with that of a
normal Transitive Verb with subject and direct object of the entity located.
Morphologically the Causative is entirely regular, producing (mi-/mo-)(ØØ-Ø-)a-gn-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to locate Y/them'. However,
syntactically this Causative seems to behave as though its b a š v e r b were
just like any normal Transitive Verb (ignoring, in other words, the
prescriptive construction for the bašverb)—for the syntax of Causatives
see 5.1.8. Consider the strange example in KEGl from the 19th century
writer C'avč'avadze: zog+ad mizez-s mi-(?Ø-?Ø-)gv-a-gn-eb-in-a
i+m gare+mo+eba-m 'that circumstance permitted us to find the general
cause', where we expect either the prescriptive zog+ad-i mizez-is-tvis
mi-(?Ø-)gv-a-gn-eb-in-a or the 'regularised' zog+ad-i mizez-i mi(Ø-)gv-a-gn-eb-in-a.
Root Verbs
The suffix -in- is attached directly to the root, which never alters shape,
as in: (da-)(Ø-Ø-)c'er 'you (will) write X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'er-412GEORGIANGRAMMARin-eb 'you (will) get X/them to write Y/them'; (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-)s-c,er
'you (will) write X/them to Y/them' => (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c,er-in-eb (tvis) 'you (will) get X/them to write Y/them (to Z/them)'; (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)zel
'you (will) knead X/them' => (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-zel-in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to knead Y/them'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-č'er 'you (will) catch X/them' =>
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'er-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to catch Y/them'; gag-a-kv-s/ga-(Ø-Ø-)i-t'an 'you (will) take inanimate X/them out' =>
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'an-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to take inanimate
Y/them out';
še-mo-g-q,+av-s/s'e-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q,van
'you (will) bring
animate X/them in' => (šmo-i-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'van-in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to bring animate Y/them in'.
I n the case of (Ø-Ø-)č' 'you (will) eat X/them' we have the old suffix
-ev retained to give (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'm-ev 'you (will) get X/them to eat
Y/them = feed Y/them to X/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'am-e, Perfect g-ič'm-ev-i-a -tvis). This can itself be causativised to give (Ø-Ø-Ø-)ač'm-ev-in-eb (-tvis) 'you (will) get X/them to feed Y/them (to Z/them)'.
The verb for 'hitting' (viz. (Ø-?Ø-)s-cem 'you (will) hit X/them') is a Root
Verb of which the same can be said as for (mi-/mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-eb
'you (will) locate X/them' above. Morphologically the Causative is entirely
regular, producing (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to hit
Y/them'. However, syntactically this Causative seems to behave as though
its b a š v e r b were just like any normal Transitive Verb (ignoring, in other
words, the prescriptive construction for the b a š v e r b ) . Consider the
examples in KEGl: the first is again from C'avč'avadze: i+k-a-mdisa mi(Ø-?Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-i mt'er-i, rom (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-e mama beber-i
'you gave the enemy his head to such a pitch that you allowed him to strike
the old father' (where the prescriptive construction would strictly require
...(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-e ma-s mam-is-tvis); the second is from Kiačeli:
tav-i ro+gor v-(Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-o? 'how should I allow X/them to hit
me?' (instead of the prescriptive tav-is-tvis ro+gor v-(?Ø-Ø-)a-cemin-o ma-s/ma-t?). The Causative of this verb is also used in the
following, difficult-to-analyse expression cxvir-s (?Ø-?Ø-)g-a-cem-ineb-s 'you sneeze' (e.g. p'et're burnut-s (Ø-)?s-c'-ev-s da p'avle-s
cxvir-s (?Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-eb-s 'Peter inhales snuff and Paul
sneezes').
Thematic Suffix -en
The Thematic Suffix is retained unchanged, to which -in- is suffixed, as in:
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-rč-en 'you (will) heal X/them' => (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rč-enin-eb 'you (will) help X/them to heal Y/them'; (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)(a-)p-en
'you (will) exhibit X/them' => (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-p-en-in-eb 'you (will)VERBAl MORPHOlOGY413get X/them to exhibit Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-cd-en 'you (will) miss [= fail
to attendj X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-cd-en-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them
to miss [= fail to attendj Y/them'; (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-sm-en 'you (will) listen to
inanimate X/them' => (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sm-en-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them
to listen to inanimate Y/them'.
Thematic Suffix -ev
The Thematic Suffix is retained unchanged, to which -in- is suffixed, as in:
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-ngr-ev 'you (will) ruin X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-ngrev-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to ruin Y/them'; da-(Ø-Ø-)l-ev 'you will
drink X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to
drink Y/them'; ( š ) ( Ø - Ø - ) a - n j g r - e v 'you (will) shake X/them' =>
(še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-njgr-ev-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to shake Y/them';
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-rc'-ev 'you (will) rock X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rc'-evin-eb 'you (will) get X/them to rock Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)?s-c'-ev 'you
(will) pull/move along/draw/drag X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'-ev-in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to pull/move along/draw/drag Y/them'; ( m i - / š ) ( Ø Ø-Ø-)a-šv-ev 'you (will) accustom X/them to Y/them' => (mi-/še-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-čv-ev-in-eb (-tvis) 'you (will) get X/them to accustom Y/them (to
Z/them)' (for an example of this verb in a Series III screeve see 5.1.8.1.3).
The verb for 'giving' in the Prešent Sub-Series is of this type, and from (ØØ-Ø-)a-)l-ev 'you give X/them to Y/them' we form the entirely regular
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)l-ev-in-eb (-tvis) 'you get X/them to give Y/them (to
Z/them)'163. Though KEGl quotes Series 11 and 111 forms for this verbform (just, indeed, as it quotes for the b a š v e r b an Aorist Indicative (ØØ-Ø-)jl-i-e and Perfect g-i-)l-ev-i-a (-tvis)), outside the Prešent SubSeries it is normal to base the Causative on the suppletive root seen in the
Future (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-)s-c-em 'you will give X/them to Y/them' to
produce the entirely regular (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c-em-in-eb (-tvis)
'you will get X/them give Y/them (to Z/them)'.
Thematic Suffix -av
The Thematic Suffix reduces to -v-, tucking itself inside the root, if the
root ends in one of the sonants -1/n/r, if the root ends in -v, one of the
two now contiguous labio-dentals disappears. If the root contains a vowel,
only the suffix - i n - is attached, whereas the longer -ev+in- is used for
roots lacking a vowel, as in: (da-)(Ø-Ø-)mal-av 'you (will) hide X/them' =>
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-mal-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to hide Y/them';
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-)č'im-av 'you (will) stretch X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'imv-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to stretch Y/them'; (gada-)(Ø-Ø-)q'lap'av 'you (will) swallow X/them' => (gada-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'lap'-v-in-eb 'you414GEORGIANGRAMMAR(will) get X/them to swallow Y/them'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)k'arg-av 'you (will) lose
X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'arg-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to lose
Y/them' [N.B. sometimes the Objective Version of the non-Causative is used
as an alternative to the Causative, as in: javr-i ra+m i+s+e (Ø-)a-c'uxeb-s, rom mada da-(Ø-Ø-)u-k'arg-o-s 'some annoyance is making X
so unhappy as to cause X to lose appetite' = ...mada da-(Ø-Ø-)a-k'argv - i n - o - s ; a+m
ambav-ma
sruli+ad
da-(Ø-)m-i-k'arg-a
mo+tm+in+eba 'this news made me lose patience completely' = ...da(Ø-)m-a-k'arg-v-in-aj; (da-i-(Ø-Ø-)rg-av 'you (will) plant X/them' =>
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rg-v-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to plant Y/them';
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)c'v-av 'you (will) burn X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'vev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to burn Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)sxl-av 'you
(will) prune X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sxvl-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to prune Y/them'; (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)xn-av 'you (will) plough X/them' =>
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvn-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to plough Y/them';
(da-)(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-k'r-av 'you (will) play instrument X' => (da-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-kVr-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to play instrument X'.
For the notion 'cause to see, shew' the Causative is based on the
perfective root -nax-, and there is a choice between the anticipated
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nax-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to see/notice
Y/them' (cf. (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nax-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to
preserve/keep Y/them') and (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nax-v-eb 'you (will) get X/them
to see Y/them'. Note the bipersonal Intransitive derivative of this latter:
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-nax-v-eb-i 'you (will) shew yourself to X/them' (=> Aorist
da-(Ø-Ø-)e-nax-v-e => Perfect da-(Ø-Ø-)nax-v-(eb-)i-x-a+r), as, for
example, in the colloquialisms: u+k'et+es-i k'ac-is tval-s ara (Ø-)enax-v-eb-a ra 'nothing better can be seen by the eye of man', and, in the
Prešent Sub-Series only: tb+il+is-i g-e-nax-v-eb-a-t 'you(Pl.) will have
seen Tbilisi'.
Thematic Suffix -i
The Thematic Suffix is lost. If there is a vowel in the root, only -in- is
suffixed, whereas -ev+in- is used where there is no vowel in the root, as
in: ( g a - ( m o - ) ) ( Ø - Ø - ) ( a - ) g z a v n - i 'you (will) šend X/them' => (ga(mo-))(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-gzavn-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to šend Y/them';
(gada-)(Ø-Ø-)targmn-i 'you (will) translate X/them' => (gada-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-targmn-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to translate Y/them'; (ga-)(ØØ-)zrd-i 'you (will) rear X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-zrd-ev+in-eb 'you
(will) get X/them to rear Y/them'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)gl-i 'you (will) exhaust
X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-gl-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to exhaust
Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)č'r-i 'you (will) cut X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-čr-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY415ev+in-eb 'you (WILL)GETX/them to cut Y/them'.
Though the verb for 'selling' has Thematic Suffix -i (viz. (ga-)(ØØ-)q'id-i 'you (will) sell X/them'), its Masdar takes a v-element as though
the Thematic Suffix were -av. This same element appears in the Causative
to give (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'id-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to sell
Y/them'—cf. (mo-XØ-Ø-Ø-)a-q'id-v-in-eb (čem-tvis) 'you (will) get
X/them to sell Y/them (to me)' and (mi-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-q'id-v-in-eb (m-istvis) 'you (will) get X/them to sell Y/them (to Z)'. Without preverb the
meaning is 'you (will) get X/them to buy Y/them' from (Ø-Ø-)q'id-ulobAØ-Ø-)i-q'id-i 'you (will) buy X/them'.
Thematic Suffix -ob
The Thematic Suffix is retained, and - i n - alone is suffixed to it, as in:
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-xrc--ob 'you (will) asphyxiate X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)axrč-ob-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to asphyxiate Y/them'; (mo-)(ØØ-)sp'-ob 'you (will) destroy X/them' => (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sp'-ob-in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to destroy Y/them'; (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-)r-ob 'you (will)
dislodge X/them (upwards)' => (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)r-ob-in-eb 'you (will)
get X/them to dislodge Y/them (upwards)', e.g.
e + s xmal-i
this sword-NOMa-mo-(Ø-Ø-)m-a-)r-ob-in-e
PREV-PREV-(you-it-)me-lV-move-TS-CAuSA O R . I N D I C ( = I MPER)kv-i+dan
stone-from
'allow me to dislodge this sword from the stone'
For the root cf. jr+av+a 'engine', (da-)(Ø-Ø-)(?s-)jr-av 'you (will) set
X/them in motion', which is virtually synonymous with the Inceptive
Causative (a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-mo+jr+av-eb 'you (will) get X/them to start
moving' based on the Inceptive (a-)mo+jr+av-d-eb-i 'you (will) start
moving' from the simple Medial
(Ø-)mo+jr+a-ob/(Ø-?Ø-)i-mo+jr+av-eb
'you (will) move' from the adjective mo+jr+av-i (k'ibe)
'moving
(stairway)'.
Thematic Suffix -am
The Thematic Suffix reduces to -m (thereby causing any root-final -v to
be lost); the suffix -ev+in- is then added, as in: (da-)(Ø-Ø-(?Ø-))a-b-am
'you (will) bind X/them (?to Y/them)' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-b-m-ev+in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to bind Y/them'; (ča-XØ-Ø-)i-cv-am 'you (will) don
X/them' (Perfect ča-g-i-cv-am-s) => (ča-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c-m-ev+in-eb416GEORGIANGRAMMAR'you (will) get X/them to don Y/them' 164 ; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)sv-am 'you (will) seat
X' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)s-m-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to seat Y' vs
(da-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-sx-am 'you (will) seat them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sx-mev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to seat them'.
We also have (Ø-Ø-)sv-am in the šense of 'you drink X'. Whilst the
Causative 'getting X to drink' is usually based on the perfective root of
'drink' (viz. - 1 - plus Thematic Suffix -ev), this non-perfective may also
provide the base for an old Causative derivation still in possible use to give
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev 'you (will) get X/them to drink Y/them' (=> Aorist (ØØ-Ø-)a-sv-i, Perfect g-i-s-m-ev-i-a -tvis); KEGl also quotes a
preverbal form in še- with the meaning 'get someone to swallow a liquid;
make someone drink something'. According to Tschenkčli (1958.I.338) the
Causative in -ev may itself be causativised to give (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-evin-eb (-tvis) 'you (will) get X/them to give Y/them as a drink (to Z/them)',
but KEGl quotes such a verb-form only as (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev-ineb 'you (will) get X/them to put stamp/frank/brand Y somewhere (= -ze)'
(Causative of (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sv-am 'you (will) put stamp X on Y') or as
(c'a-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to smear X/them
(on Y/them = -ze)' (Causative of (c'a-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-sv-am 'you (will)
smear/rub X/them on Y/them'). For 'slurping = drinking noisily' we have the
Root Verbs (še-)(Ø-Ø-)xvrep' = (še-)(Ø-Ø-)xvret', and for these the
Causative is simply (and irregularly) (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvrep' = (še-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-xvret',
N.B. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-tk-m-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to say Y/them'
(with preverb gada- the meaning would be 'gainsay'; with ga-mo- it is
'make express'; with c'ar-mo- it would be 'make declare').
Thematic Suffix -opThe Thematic Suffix is retained, and -in- alone is suffixed, as in: (ga-)(ØØ-)q'-op 'you (will) split X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'-op-in-eb 'you
(will) get X/them to split Y/them'.
Consideration of the above-forms in comparison with the formation of
Masdars (see 4.9.1) reveals that the stem for the Causative is what is left of
the Masdar after removal of the final -a Masdar-exponent.
4.8.1 An Old Causative Formant?
The regular Causative marker in Svan is -un-/-wn-, and there are a few
verbs containing such an element inGEORGIAN,which are best explained by
assigning the relevant morph an original causative-function. Consider:
(šXØ-Ø-la-)rc'-un-eb 'you (will) make X/them shudder' vs (še-)(Ø-)VERBAl MORPHOlOGY417jrc'-un-d-eb-i 'you (will) start to shudder' from (Ø-)jrc'-i 'you shudder'
(Imperfect (Ø-)jrc'-od-i), which is limited to the Prešent Sub-Series and
has the Masdar jrc'-ol-a or j r c ' - u n - v - a ; tav-s
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)im+k'vd+ar-un-eb 'you (will) pretend to be dead' from m+k'vd+ar-i
'dead'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-tb-un-eb 'you (will) cover all round and thus keep
X/them warm' from (ga-)(Ø-)tb-eb-i 'you (will) get warm'; (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)acx-un-eb 'you (will) give out heat' from (ga-)cx+el-d-eb-a 'it gets (will
get) hot'; (da-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-rc'm-un-eb 'you (will) convince X/them (of Y =
-ši)' from g-(r)c'am-s 'you believe X/them'. From the root seen in (Ø-)
xt'-i 'you are jumping' and (Ø-)xt'-eb-i 'you jump (in some direction)' we
have two Medial near-synonyms of (Ø-)xt'-i, namely (Ø-)xt'-un-av 'you
jump on the spot' (=> Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-xt'-un-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-xt'un-e, Perfect g-i-xt'-un-i-a) and (Ø-)xt'-un+a-ob 'you jump around' (=>
Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-xt'-un-av-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-xt'-un-av-e =>
Perfect g-i-xt'-un-av-i-a). In turn we have the Causatives meaning 'you
(will) get X/them to jump about': (Ø-Ø-)a-xt'-un-eb (=> Aorist (Ø-Ø-)axt'-un-e => Perfect g-i-xt'-un-eb-i-a) and (Ø-Ø-)a-xt'-un-av-eb (=>
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)a-xt'-un-av-e => Perfect g-i-xt'-un-av-eb-i-a).
4.8.2 The Causative for Medial Verbs
The Causative of Medials is simply the b a š f o r m with a-versioniser which
in its Subjective Version provides the Medial with its Future Sub-Series and
Series 11 screeves (Series 111 then being formed, as one would expect from
these, esšentially Transitive Verb-forms, by inversion and other
appropriate adaptations). Such (pseudo-)Causatives share with the Medial
the feature that even in the normally perfective screeves no preverb is
used. And so, we have such correspondence-sets as the following:

Future (?Ø-)i-dug-eb-s vs (rje-s) (Ø-Ø-)a-dug-eb 'you (will) boil (the418GEORGIANGRAMMARmilk)'. In Series III, whilst the Medials incorporate no Thematic Suffix -eb
but often do insert the element -n-, the corresponding (pseudo-)Causatives
do incorporate the Thematic Suffix -eb and form the three screeves of
this Series as one would expect—for example: Perfect cecxl-i g-iguzguz-eb-i-a 'you apparently made the fire crackle/roar' vs Pluperfect
cecxl-i g-e-guzguz-eb-in-a vs III rd Subjunctive cecxl-i g-eguzguz-eb-in-o-s. Note how screeves differ for the verbs 'learn' and
'teach': (Ø-(Ø-))sc'avl-ob 'you learn (X/them)' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avli165 => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-e => Perfect g-i-sc'avl-i-a => Pluperfect ge - s c ' a v l - a => III rd Subjunctive g - e - s c ' a v l - o - s vs ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) a sc'avl-i 'you (will) teach X/them to Y/them' 1 6 6 => Aorist ( Ø - Ø Ø-)a-sc'avl-e => Perfect g-i-sc'avl-eb-i-a -tvis => Pluperfect g - e sc'avl-eb-in-a -tvis => III rd Subjunctive g-e-sc'avl-eb-in-o-s -tvis;
in the perfective screeves of both 'learn' and 'teach' either of the preverbs
š e - / d a - may in fact be used, presumably when the nuance is of a full
acquisition of knowledge.
From (Ø-Ø-)xmar-ob 'you use X/them' (Future (Ø-Ø-)i-xmar-eb; cf.
(da-/mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xmar-eb-i 'you (will) help X/them' 1 6 7 ) we have
(da-/mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xmar(-eb) 'you (will) use X/themDO for the
benefit of/to assist Y/themI O', where we note the optionality of employing
the Thematic Suffix -eb in Series I (cf. the synonyms (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø(Ø-Ø-)švel-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-i
'you (will) aid
Ø-)a-švel-eb from
X/them' and (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-s'vel-eb-i 'you (will) come/go to the
assistance of X/them'). Cf. (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-švel+i-eb = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)ixmar-eb 'you (will) bring in X/them in aid; make advantageous use of
X/them'.
There are, however, some exceptions to this, as shewn by the following:
(Ø-Ø-)varaud-ob 'you suppose X/them' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-varaud-eb vs
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-varaud-eb-in-eb 'you (will) cause X/them to suppose

4.8.2.1 The Causative of Inceptives Derived from Medials
Inceptive derivatives from Medials, which are formally suffixal Intransitive
Verbs, utilise a preverb (often a-) in the perfective screeves. By adding
this (or the relevant) preverb to a Medial's (pseudo-)Causative we produce
the Inceptive Causative, as in: (Ø-)tamaš--ob/(Ø-?Ø-)i-tamaš-eb 'you
(will) play' => (Ø-Ø-)a-tamaš-eb 'you (will) get X/them to play' vs
(še-i-(Ø-)tamaš'-d-eb-i 'you (will) start to play' => (še-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-tamas'-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY421eb 'you (will) get X/them to start to play'; (Ø-)t'ir-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-eb 'you
(will) cry' => (Ø-Ø-)a-t'ir-eb 'you (will) get X/them to cry' vs (a-)(Ø-)t'ird-eb-i 'you (will) start to cry' => (a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-t'ir-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to start to cry'; (Ø-)mger-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-mger-eb 'you (will) sing' =>
(Ø-Ø-)a-mger-eb 'you (will) get X/them to sing' vs (a-)(Ø-)mger-deb-i 'you (will) start to sing' => (a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-mger-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to start to sing'; dug-s/(?Ø-)i-dug-eb-s 'X boils/will boil' => (ØØ-)a-dug-eb 'you (will) boil X/them' vs (a-)dug-d-eb-a 'X starts (will
start) to boil' => (a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-dug-eb 'you (will) get X/them to start to boil'.
4.8.2.2 The Causative of Semelfactives Derived from Medials
The use of a preverb in the perfective screeves with a basically Medial
verb-form indicates a one-off, semelfactive occurrence of the verbal
action. By using that preverb with the Medial's (pseudo-)Causative we
causativise the semelfactive, as in:
(Ø-)q'vir-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-q,vir-eb
'you
(will) yell' => (Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you (will) get X/them to yell' vs da-(Ø-?
Ø-)i-q'vir-eb 'you will let out a yell' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you (will)
get X/them to let out a yell'.
(Ø-)suntk-av/(Ø-?Ø-)i-suntk-eb
'you
(will) breathe' => (Ø-Ø-)a-suntk-eb 'you (will) get X/them to breath' vs (am o - ) ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - s u n t k - e b 'you (will) breathe out' => (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)as u n t k - e b 'you (will) get X/them to breathe out', for which the full
Causative (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-suntk-eb-in-eb (or even (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)asuntk-v-in-eb) may serve as synonym, ara+vin
č'aš'an-eb-s/(?Ø-)ič ' a č ' a n - e b - s 'no-one is/will be somewhere' => ara+vi-s
(Ø-Ø-)aš'ač'an-eb 'you (will) allow no-one to be somewhere' vs ara+vin ga(?Ø-)i-č""ač'an-eb-s 'no-one will put in an appearance somewhere' =>
ara+vi-s ga-(Ø-Ø-)a-č'ač'an-eb 'you (will) allow no-one to put in an
appearance somewhere'.
These examples are not easy to find, for with a number of verbs there
seems to be no great difference between the expected semelfactive
meaning resulting from coupling a preverb with the Medial verb-form and
an inceptive šense. For example, there is no formal inceptive cognate for
(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you (will) laugh', but the preverbal ga(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb is glossed by KEGl as 'you will start to laugh', and so
the corresponding (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-cin-eb is glossed as 'you will cause
X/them to laugh, bring laughter to X/them, get X/them to burst out
laughing' (vs (Ø-Ø-)a-cin-eb 'you (will) get X/them to laugh'). In the case
of ( Ø - ( Ø - ) ) l a p , a r a k , - o b / ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - l a p , a r a k , - e b 'you (will) speak
(something)' we do have a formal inceptive (namely (a-)(Ø-)lap'arak'-deb-i 'you (will) start to speak') to which the Causative is (a-)(Ø-Ø-)alap'arak'-eb 'you (will) get X/them to start speaking'. In contrast we422GEORGIANGRAMMARhave the formal semelfactive da-(Ø-?Ø-)i-lap , arak'-eb, but this is
glossed in virtually the same way as a-(Ø-)lap'arak'-d-eb-i, namely
'begin speaking, give voice, say something, start into speech'. However, the
formally equivalent Causative is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-lap'arak'-eb, which is
glossed as: 'you (will) give someone the opportunity to speak, get someone
to give voice, allow someone to speak with someone' (e.g. ar-c k'i da(Ø-)a-lap'arak'-a 'X didn't even allow Y/them to speak', which, however,
is possibly better interpreted semelfactively as 'didn't allow the saying of
even a word' than inceptively as 'didn't allow to start speaking'). Similarly
for one of the examples in KEGl, namely:
ro+gor ga-(?Ø-)i-xar-eb-d-a,
rom

PREV-(?3rd.PER-)SV-speak-TS-IMPERF-FuT.SuBJ-he
'how X would rejoice if the sick person were to become conscious, were
to speak'
where 'speak' does not necessarily mean 'start to speak' but rather 'say just
a little (sc. in order to shew that the power of speech has returned)', but
perhaps we are here being overly precious in trying to detect semantic
subtleties.
4.9 Non-finite Forms of the Verb (zmn-is ara=pinit , +ur-i pormeb-i)
The non-finite forms we shall be examining are: (i) the verbal noun (or
Masdar), (ii) the Active (sometimes called Prešent) Participle, (iii) the Future
Participle, (iv) the Privative Participle, (v) the Past Participle. Not every
root will necessarily possess each of these forms. Version (with one
possible exception) has no role to play in non-finite forms, and no
agreement-markers occur here either. The non-finite forms of Irregular
Verbs are given together with all the other information about them in 4.1Ø.
The general description of, and relevant comments about, the four
participles will be prešented in sub-sections 4.9.2-4.9.5, which last sub­
section will then include particular details as they relate to the different
sub-types of verb and exemplification for all four participles of the
selected verbal roots, each selection beginning with the Masdar.","[428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441]"
"Other verb-forms include: (ša-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-cv-am 'you (will) put
clothing on X/them', (ča-)(Ø-Ø-)i-cv-am 'you (will) put clothing on254GEORGIANGRAMMARyourself', (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-b-am 'you (will) tie X/them up'.
Thematic Suffix -op

ga-(Ø-Ø-)q'av-i-t
ga-(Ø-)q'v-es4.7.1.2.2 Aorist Subjunctive (me+or+e k'avšir+eb+it-i)
Apart from its role in certain types of subordinate clause or in association
with certain modal particles, this screeve is used to express (i) wishes (and
hence is known by some as the Optative Mood), (ii) exhortations ('let's
VERB'), (iii) 3rd person commands ('X is/They are to VERB'), and (iv)
deliberative questions ('Am I/Are you etc... to VERB?'). Prohibitions
(negative commands) may be expressed by means of ar plus this screeve.
All Transitive Verbs (other than 'give', which is discussed separately in
4.1Ø), form their Aorist Subjunctive by means of either -o or -a, which
vowels are added to the form of the root used for the Aorist Indicative
with 3rd person subject and remain throughout the conjugation. The 3rd
person singular subject selects the allomorph -s, whilst the 3rd person
plural subject takes -n.
Thematic Suffix -eb
All such verbs (with the exception of two problematic roots) have their
Aorist Subjunctive in -o, thus:

Screeves of Transitive Verbs in this Series are characterised by the
phenomenon of 'inversion', which means that the subject stands in the
Dative and is co-indexed in the verb-form by means of the appropriate Set
B affix, which is accompanied in the Perfect by the Objective Version
vowels but in the Pluperfect and IIIrd Subjunctive by the Indirect Object
Version—since these versions are obligatory for these screeves, they are
devoid of any versional meaning, and the reflexive/benefactive/locational
functions of the Subjective/Objective/locative Versions respectively have
to be expressed, where needed, with III rd Series' forms by means of the
appropriate (postpositional) phrases external to the verbal complex.
Correspondingly the direct object stands in the Nominative and is coindexed by means of the appropriate Set A affix. The indirect object is
outside the verbal complex entirely, standing in the Genitive case
dependent upon the postposition -tvis 'for'.
Since the Dative nominal is the subject, a 3rd person plural animate
subject will have its plurality marked on the verb (viz. by the suffix -t),
unless the direct object is 1st or 2nd person46, whereas the plurality of a
3rd person Nominative direct object will never be indicated.
Screeves of this Series are usually of perfective aspect, so that those
roots which normally take a preverb in the Future Sub-Series and in Series
11 will do the same in Series III.
For the uses of this Series see Peikrishvili (1974), a work which is259VERBAl MORPHOlOGY
drawn upon in the descriptions below.","[272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278]"
"GEORGIANGRAMMAR284Sometimes an older pattern of conjugation is found, and it so happens
that two of the verbs just illustrated, namely 'unite with' and 'burn', often
manifest this older pattern, which is now set out:
unite with
v-(Ø-)e-rt-v-i
(Ø-Ø-)e-rt-v-i
(Ø-)e-rt-v-i-s
v-[Ø-)e-rt-v-i-t

v-i-c'v-i
(Ø-)i-cV-i
i-cV-i-s
v-i-c'v-i-t
(Ø-)i-c'v-i-t
i-cV-i-anWith the latter verb this pattern seems especially common in
expressions of the type tval-eb-i m-e~cV-i-s = m-e-c'v-eb-a 'my eyes
are burning'. For the former verb we see the 3rd person singular form in
the toponym x+e+rt+v+i+s-i, literally 'that which joins X', where the 3rd
person indirect object is shewn by its original marker (x-, see Shanidze
1981).
Thematic Suffix -iThe pattern is prefixal, with the Thematic Suffix dropping before -eb:
be weighable
v-i-c'on-eb-i
(Ø-)i-c'on-eb-i
i-c'on-eb-a
v-i-c'on-eb-i-t
(Ø-)i-c'on-eb-i-t

i-č'r-eb-a
v-i-č'r-eb-i-t
(Ø-)i-č'r-eb-i-t
i-č'r-eb-i-anNote the following pairings: (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)xd-i 'you (will) make X/them
become something' => markerless (Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you become something' (this
also means 'you grow thin'); (gada-)(Ø-Ø-)i-xd-i 'you (will) pay' =>
markerless g-xd-eb-a 'payment devolves upon you'; but (a-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)
xd-i 'you (will) remove X/them from the top of Y/them' => prefixal
ag+mo+sa+vl+et-s si+bnel-is parda (Ø-)e-xd-eb-a 'the curtain of
darkness of being raised from the east'.
Thematic Suffix -obFormation is split between the prefixal and markerless types. Those roots
that follow the prefixal pattern retain the Thematic Suffix -ob and do not285VERBAl MORPHOlOGYadd any -eb, whereas those that follow the markerless pattern lose -ob by
replacing it with -eb; roots that basically contain or end in -v will now
find this element restored. Included in the illustrations is the Intransitive
of (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-rt-ob 'you (will) amuse X/them' (e.g. r-iti (Ø-?Ø-)e-rtob-i(-t)? 'how do you amuse yourself (yourselves)?'), which is formally
bipersonal (though monovalent) meaning 'amuse oneself' or 'lose oneself
entirely in X/them (= -ši)', for no external Dative indirect object is
associated with it:
choke/drown

(Ø-?Ø-)e-rt-ob-i-t
(?Ø-)e-rt-ob-i-anFrom (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nd-ob 'you (will) entrust X/them to Y/them' (where
outside the Prešent Sub-Series the preverb m i - / m o - is optional) we get
the Intransitive (Ø-Ø-)e-nd-ob-i 'you (will) have trust/confidence in
X/them'.
Thematic Suffix -am
The prefixal pattern is employed. The Thematic Suffix is retained in its
reduced form of - m - before -eb; if the root should end in -v, this latter
disappears under the influence of the now contiguous bilabial nasal. The
illustrated verb is the Intransitive counterpart of (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-b-am 'you
(will) bind X/them':
be bound/bindable
v-i-b-m-eb-i
v-i-b-m-eb-i-t
(Ø-)i-b-m-eb-i (Ø-)i-b-m-eb-i-t
i-b-m-eb-a
i-b-m-eb-i-an
Some roots of this sub-class may behave like some of those in -av by
employing the older conjugation in -i without suffix - e b - and with 3rd
person singular marking in - s . The root - s v - in the šense of 'pose
(question), put (Pl.)nctuation mark)' not only illustrates this but also the loss
of root-final -v—from sa+k'itx-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-)sv-am 'you (will) pose a
question' we get sa+k'itx-i i-s-m-eb-a = i-s-m-i-s, which forms are,
however, more likely in the Future Sub-Series (sc. with preverb da-), for286GEORGIANGRAMMARi-s-m-eb-a is more usual in the šense of 'X is drinkable', whilst i-s-m-i-s
is more normally used in the šense of 'X is audible (smellable)'. Belonging
here are the alternatives i - t k - m - e b - a = i - t k - m - i - s 'X is being
said/sayable' from the root -tkv- which we shall see in Series 11 and 111
for the verb 'say' (vid. 4.1Ø), though it also found as a normal Transitive
(with Subjective Version in Series I and II) in the verbal phrase sul-s
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-tkv-am 'you (will) breathe deeply; exist'. Interestingly,
KEGl quotes only the verb-form (Ø-)e-tk-m-i-s for the bipersonal form
meaning 'X can say Y/them' or 'X can be said of Y'.
Thematic Suffix -op
The prefixal mechanism is employed with -op retained without any
additional Thematic Suffix, thus:
divide
v-i-q'-op-i
(Ø-)i-q'-op-i
i-q'-op-av-i-q'-op-i-t
(Ø-)i-q'-op-i-t
i-q'-op-i-ancf. jma jma-s (Ø-)e-q'-op-a 'brother splits away from brother', where
the preverb in perfective screeves would be ga-mo-.
Others
A number of Intransitive verbs have no Transitive equivalents, and many
are in any case exceptional in terms of their morphology, such as the
copula and the verb of motion. These together with some other irregular
verbs (both Intransitive and Transitive) are prešented separately in 4.1Ø.
Here we can mention: (i) xd-eb-a 'X is happening', whose perfectivising
preverb is mo-—is this related to the Transitive form seen in apxaz-eb-i
k'arg
š+ta+beč'd+il+eba-s
mo-(Ø-)a-xd-en-en
š e n - z e 'the
Abkhazians will make a good impression on you'? (ii) With the perfectivising
preverb ga- this same verb-form (Ø-)xd-eb-i may mean 'you grow thin',
which has no Transitive counterpart, though in the šense of 'you become
something' with this same preverb it does correspond to (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)xd-i.
(iii) With the perfectivising preverb a- this same verb-form xd-eb-a
means '(dream/wish) is being fulfilled', which again has no Transitive
counterpart, (iv) (Ø-)h-qv-eb-i may mean 'you follow X/them' (with a
variety of preverbs for different directions 55 , though with ga-(mo-) the
verb can be used of a woman following a man col-ad 'as wife', i.e.
marrying him); presupposing the preverb mo-, this verb-form may mean
'you relate (some story)', and, if a hearer for the story is expressed, the287VERBAl MORPHOlOGYverb-form becomes (mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'v-eb-i (e.g. romel zgap'ar-s
(Ø-?Ø-)gv-i-qV-eb-i? 'what tale are you telling to us?'). (v) (Ø-)jg-eb-i,
with preverb ga-, means 'you eat to satiety' and relates to the Transitive
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-jg-eb = (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-jg-ob (Aorist ga-(Ø-Ø-)a-jg-e,
Perfect ga-g-i-jgv-i-a 56 ). (vi) (Ø-)jvr-eb-i 57 , with a variety of preverbs
for different directions, means 'you Pass through a narrow gap; you sneak
somewhere' and relates to the Transitive (Ø-Ø-)a-jvr-en 'you Pass
X/them through a narrow opening; you spirit X/them somewhere' (e.g.
uk'an+a k'ar-i+dan ga-m-a-jvr-en-en 'they will spirit me out of the
back door'). This verb is not to be confused with the verb in mo+x+u+c-s
jaš'v-i-s rgol-eb-i (ga-)s-jvr-eb-a 'the chain's rings are being (will
be) removed from the old man', which is the Intransitive form of (ga-)(ØØ-Ø-)a-jr-ob 'you (will) strip off/remove X/them for Y/them' (Aorist ga(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-jvr-e).
4.7.2.1.1.2 Imperfect Indicative
The universal marker is the suffix - o d - , which is attached to the
(rightmost) Thematic Suffix of the Prešent Indicative. To this is added -i,
if the subject is 1st or 2nd person, whilst a 3rd person singular subject
selects -a, a 3rd person plural subject -nen—in other words, the elements
that follow the Imperfect suffix are identical in every respect to those that
follow the Imperfect suffix -d- in the Imperfect Indicative of Transitive
Verbs. The only other change to note is that the -v- of the Thematic
Suffix -ev is lost under the influence of the immediately following -o, as
indeed is the remnant of the Thematic Suffix -av in those forms of this
sub-class which allow the older type of conjugation. An arbitrary selection
of Imperfect Indicatives follows:

all forms other than when the subject is 3rd person plural, whose
agreement-marker is -nen; a 3rd person singular subject selects the
allomorph -s. The Prešent Subjunctive for Intransitive Verbs is thus

To use the negated Pluperfect here (ar mo-(Ø-)e-mzad-eb-in-a)
would give the meaning 'X was afraid the pupil would prepare the lesson').
If it is the main verb which is negated, then the subordinate clause will
take the form of fully indirect or semi-indirect speech, e.g.

If a negated and non-past introductory verb is also queried, then the
subordinate clause's Future Indicative may be replaced by the (nonnegated) Aorist SUBJunctive, a Prešent Indicative in the subordinate clause
being replaceable by the (non-negated) Prešent SUBJunctive. If the negated

where we note the prešence of the speech-particle -o. In this example
t+i+tk+o may shift backwards to take the place of rom. Note the use of
the speech-particle with the following false proposition:626GEORGIANGRAMMARzog-i

some used to think: «Xi has made a mistake» saying').
If it is deemed fit guardedly to prešent a proposition which may be
true, then the appropriate SUBJunctive may substitute for the indicative

Where a noun-clause of non-past time-reference is employed as a
virtual substitute for an indirect alternative question, then the SUBJunctive
seems to be mandatory, e.g.

orA similar restriction on the use of the indicative seems to apply when

"SYNTAX5315.1.1.4 Ergative (mo+txr+ob+it-i)
In the literary language and most of the dialects this case has but the one
function of marking the subject of Transitive and Medial verbs (i.e.
transitive verb-forms) in Series 11.
If we take expletives like g m e r t - m a n - i 'by God!' or a + m - i s - m a
mze-m this-GEN-AGR sun-ERG 'by this one's sun! = may the sun bless this
one!', it may look as though there is a further function to be described. But
it is likely that such expressions can be traced back to full phrases where
the Ergative will be seen to be performing its basic role; the former
example, for instance, comes from gmert-man (Ø-)i-c-i-s God-ERG
(3rd.PER-)SV-know-PRES.INDIC-he 'God knows'.
5.1.1.5 Dative (mi+c+em+it-i)
This case proto-typically marks (a) indirect objects but can also mark
(b) some direct objects as well as
(c) some logical subjects;
(d) a number of postpositions govern the Dative; (e) it parallels the
Nominative in temporal expressions of duration and regularity (e.g. q'ovel
dge-s/tve-s/k'vira-s/game-s/c'el-s 'every day/month/week/night/
year');
(f) stating the day and, if the month is mentioned, dates requires the Dative
(e.g. šabat-s 'on Saturday', p'irvel mais-s first May-DAT = 'on 1st May',
or noember-s 2 November-DAT = 'on 2nd November—N.B. the cardinal
is used for numbers not involving the element 'first'), whereas the
postposition -Si is used if only the number is given (e.g. p'irvel-ši 'on the
1st', or-ši 'on the 2nd')—other specific time-points include: dila-s 'in the
morning', sa(+)gam(+)o-s 'in the evening', na + sadil + e v - s 'in the
afternoon', dge-s 'today', šua-dge-s 'at mid-day' (cf. the GEN-DAT ending
in the synonymous šua-dg-isa-s, and note that for 'at mid-night' only this
complex ending šua-gam-isa-s is offered in the dictionaries),
na+šua+gam+ev-s 'in the early hours';
(g) today the postpositions -šl 'in, at' and -ze 'on, at' are usually employed
where OldGEORGIANcould happily have used just the Dative, and there are
at least three nouns where the simple Dative (albeit with an unusual avowel before the Dative-suffix -s) are stIII as common as the postpositional
equivalents (viz. a+m a+dg+il-as/a+dg+il-ze 'at this place', a+m c'ut-532GEORGIANGRAMMARa s / c ' u t - š i '(at) this minute', (na+)p'ir-as 'on the edge' = ( n a + ) p ' i r z e / k ' i d e - z e as in č'-is p'ir-as 'on the edge of the well', m i n d v r - i s
na+p'ir-as 'on the edge of the meadow');
(h) The verb 'to prefer' is an Indirect Verb with logical subject in the
Dative and logical object in the Nominative. Nevertheless, the entity to
which the logical object is preferred, when expressed, also stands in the
Dative, e.g.
m-i-rč(+)ev(+)n-i-a
p'ur-i
gorn-s
I -OV-prefer-PRES-it
bread-NOM grits-DAT
'I prefer bread to grits'
kal-s

šen-s
woman-DAT I-(she-)OV-prefer-PRES-I-COP
your-AGR
'the woman prefers me to you'tav-s
head-DATIn the related Mingrelian language the postposition -s'a must attach to
the entity preferred (e.g. respectively for these same meanings m-i-sxunu kobal-i gum-ša and osur-s v-(Ø-)u-sxun-u-k skan+i dud+i-ša);
(i) See 5.1.3 and 5.2.2.2.3 for the Dative with participles, and 5.1.5 for the
Dative accompanying the Masdar.
5.1.1.6 Instrumental (mo+km+ed+eb+it-i)
This basically signifies (a) the instrument or means by which an action is
accomplished (e.g. sxv-is-i xel-it ga-k'et-eb-ul-i sa(+)km(+)e otherGEN-AGR hand-INST PREV-make-TS-RPTC-AGR
deed(NOM) = 'a deed
done at another's hand');
(b) the postposition -urt (from cardinal ert-i '1') governs the Instrumental
and shews accompaniment (e.g. col=šv(+)il-it-urt 'with wife and child',
with which is synonymous the Adverbial of an adjective in -Ian-:
c o l = š v ( + ) i l - i a n - a d , which in turn is paralleled by the comitative
postposition - t a n followed by the Adverbial of the cardinal T :
col=šv(+)il-tan ert-ad);
(c) the Instrumental has certain temporal functions: when a non-continuous
activity has an effect that lasts for some time, that period is marked by the
Instrumental, e.g.
a+k

PREV-PREY-I-(him-)NV-šend-AOR.INDIC
6-AGR month-INST
'I have come here (//šent my student here) for 6 months'If the Dative alone can refer to a specific point in time, one can take
season- and week-names (plus a few others) and add to them the abstractnoun formant -oba in the Instrumental to indicate, in most cases,
habituality, expressions which are synonymous with combinations of the
type 'q'ovel + DAT' (e.g. o r + š a b a t - o b - i t 'on Mondays', z a m t r - o b - i t
'(regularly) in the winter', sa(+)gam(+)o-ob-it 'of an evening', though here
the plain Instrumental sa(+)gam(+)o-ti (= q'ovel sa(+)gam(+)o-s)
suffices; cT-ob-it, however, means rather 'over a period of years', as seen
in:

year-ABST-INST PREV-acquire-P.PTC-DAT
(it-)lošTS-X
c'am-ita

'What X has acquired over a period of years X loses in a second'
The expression 'in a second', however, is usually Dative c ' a m - s or
postpositional c'am-ši, but dil-it 'in the morning' is used like the Dative
dila-s especially in such phrases as dil-it adre//adr+ian(+ad) 'early in
the morning');
(d) the verb 'take advantage of' governs an object in the Instrumental, e.g.
v-(?Ø-)i-sa+rg+eb+l-eb

(f) compass-points in expressions such as 'to the north (of X)' utilise the
Instrumental (e.g. (zugdid-is)
(5rdilo+et-it/sa+mxr+et-it/da+sa+
vl+et-it/ag+mo+sa+vl+et-it Zugdidi-GEN
north-INST/south-INST/
west-INST/east/-INST
'to the north/south/west/east (of Zugdidi)');
(g) some expressions stand in the Instrumental (e.g. čem-i(s) azr-it 'in my

mother-INST Svan-NOM-is 'X's a Svan on his/her mother's side', londonis dro-it 'by london-time');
(h) by adding the abstract-noun formant -oba in the Instrumental case to a
cardinal root one produces the expression for 'in NuMBERs', e.g.

as-ob-it
soldier-Pl-NOM
100-ABST-INST
'the soldiers are standing in hundreds'dg-a-n-an
stand-PRES-3rd.PER.Pl-theyThis form, always invariant, can act as a sort of adjective in expressions of

'hundreds and thousands of workers are congregating under one roof'
5.1.1.7 Adverbial (vitar+eb+it-i)
Basically the case serves (a) to make a predication, e.g.
k'ac-is k'vl-a
cod+v+a-d
i-tvl-eb-a

(b) adding the Adverbial ending to adjectives produces the equivalent535SYNTAXadverb, though some adverbs lack the final -d (e.g. lamaz-ad 'beautifully',
k'arg-ad 'well', čkar-a 'quickly', nel-a 'slowly');
(c) the Future Participle in the Adverbial is a non-finite way of expressing
a purpošclause and will be exemplified below (5.2.2.1.1);
(d) governed by the postposition -mde (older form -mdis) 'upto' the case's
final -d is dropped in ModernGEORGIAN(e.g. kalak-a-mde 'as far as the
town'). The postposition may be reinforced by vi+d+re, especially, it
seems, when dates are given (e.g. vi+d+re 1917 cT-a-mde upto 1917
year-ADV-upto 'upto the year 1917'1);
(e) prices are expressed by the Adverbial, e.g.
e + s beč'ed-i
v-(Ø-)i-q'id-e
this ring-NOM
I-(it-)SV-buy-AOR.INDIC
'I bought this ring for 1,ØØØ pounds'at-as

gada+targmn+il-i-a
GEORGIAN-ADVGEORGIAN(language)-on translated-NOM-is
'It is translated intoGEORGIAN'
5.1.1.8 Ablative (da+čor+eb+it-i) = Instrumental+-gan (see 3.4.3)
This simply indicates spatial or temporal source (e.g. mindvr-i(+)dan 'from
the meadow', dge-i(+)dan 'from today', i+m dg-i(+)dan 'from that day').
N.B. the middle vowel in a+k-e+dan 'from here'.
5.1.2 The Adnominal Genitive (cf. 3.1.1)
In ModernGEORGIANadnominal Genitives usually precede their head-nouns
(e.g. saxl-is k'edel-i houšGEN
wall-NOM 'the wall of the house', rtul-i
st'rukt'ur-is zmna complex-AGR structure-GEN verb(NOM) 'a verb of
complex structure'). In OldGEORGIANthis order was reversed, and the
older sequence is not unknown even today, most naturally when the headnoun stands in the Nominative or Dative. In such cases the Genitive takes
its long form (e.g. k'edel-i saxl-isa). The reason for this is that in the
ancient language the c a š e n d i n g of the head was repeated at the end of
the NP (giving in this particular example k'edel-i saxl-isa-y). Because
the palatal semi-vowel has disappeared, the nature of this structure is536GEORGIANGRAMMARobscured, but when the head-noun is Dative, the Dative ending can stIII be
repeated on the following Genitive (e.g. k'edel-s saxl-isa(-s)). Though
the modern examples of such reduplication are not unknown when the
head-noun is Vocative, Ergative and Adverbial, they have a distinctly
archaic flavour. However, there is one circumstance where this possibility
of double c a š m a r k i n g is fully utilised today, regardless of which c a š
marker follows the Genitive, and this is where the head-noun is gapped, e.g.
čem-i
my-AGRvaž+i+šv(+)il-is
son-GENkc+ev+a-m
behaviour-ERGga-m-a-oc-a,
PREV-me-NV-amazeit(AOR)kal+i+šv(+)il-isa-m
k'i
ara
daughter-GEN-ERG
however not
'My son's behaviour amazed me, but not that of my daughter'
The end-sequence -GEN-DAT (-isa-s) when associated with a verbal
noun (theGEORGIANMasdar—cf. 5.1.5) functions as a reduced temporal
clause 'at the time of VERBing', being a short-hand version of the Masdar
in the Genitive dependent upon dro-s time-DAT 'at the time (sc. of
VERBing)' (e.g. ezo-ši š e - s v l - i s a - s / / š s v l - i s dro-s yard-into PREVenter(MASD)-GEN-DAT//PREV-enter(MASD)-GEN
time-DAT 'at the
moment of entering the yard'). This same construction is found with
ordinary nouns which, while not formally masdars, have a sort of verbal
force (e.g. masal-is analiz-isa-s material-GEN analysis-GEN-DAT 'while
analysing the material').
5.1.3 The Attributive Adjective (cf. 3.2.1)
ModernGEORGIAN,unlike its older variant, places adjectives in front of
their heads. Vowel-final adjectives shew no agreement at all with their
heads, whilst the literary language has settled on the following pattern of
agreement (cf. 3.2.1 and 5.Ø.1) for consonant-finals, where mc'vane =
'green', lamaz-i = 'beautiful', and čit'-i = 'bird':NOMINATIVE

noun in the relevant c a š f o r m stands before the conjunction da 'and'. If
adjectives are conjoined with an NP, the adjective preceding da can be
treated as if it were a noun and given the long desinence appropriate to
the noun it qualifies; this phenomenon is most often seen for Genitive and
Dative NPs, e.g.

An oddity was noted in literary Georgia (ll-XI-88, p. 13): as we have
seen, adjectives meaning 'possessed of N' may be freely formed by using
the derivational suffix -ian-i, so that 'a mother with a child' will be
bavšv-ian-i deda. The noun-base of such adjectives is itself qualifiable
by an adjective, and the example in question reads: ak'van-ši m+q'+op-i
bavšv-ian-i deda-c 'and a mother with a child (being) in a cradle'. A
native speaker, when prešented with this example for comment, reacted
somewhat negatively to the prešence on the epithet of the final vocalic
agreement-affix. If such compounds as m+k'vet+r+na+k'vt+eb-ian-i
'sharp-featured' (<= m+k'vet+r-i plus na+k'vt-eb-i), naz+bumbul-ian-i
'soft-downed' and lamaz+q'd-ian-i 'with beautiful covers (of books)'
reprešent the norm, then the bare stem for the adjective (namely m+q'+op)
would indeed be anticipated here. Note also the almost exact parallel to
the oddity above in Vazha Pshavela's ga+šav+eb+ul sa+rkv+el-ian-ad
'blackened cover and all', where the qualifying participle is without any
ending.
When the kinship-terms m a m a 'father', deda 'mother', bija 'uncle',
p'ap'a/babua 'grandfather', di+deda/bebia 'grandmother', m a m + i + d a
'father's sister', and de+i+da 'mother's sister' are coupled with a possessive
adjective, the possessive is placed after the noun and written with a
hyphen to indicate that the sequence is viewed as a single word, such that
only the possessive changes for case.
Quantifiers prescriptively require the singular form of the noun, though538GEORGIANGRAMMARcolloquially the plural is also heard (e.g. or-i, ra+m(o+)den+i+me,
mraval-i cxvar-i '2/some/several sheep').
In an example like '3 Xs of Y(s)'GEORGIANtreats 'Y' as the head of the
expression, whilst the rest functions as a complex quantifier, as exemplified
by three c a š f o r m s for the expression '3 baskets of apples', where sam-i
= '3', godor-i = 'basket', and vašl-i = 'apple':

jointly can then similarly function as a complex quantifier (e.g.

Quantifiers of the form 'cardinal and a half Xs' place na+x+ev+ar-i

reduced relative clauses may be accompanied by arguments from that
clause. If the head-noun has attributes of its own, in order not to overload
the pre-nominal slot, the adjective phrase can follow the head. With active
participles of transitive verbs the underlying direct object becomes an
objective Genitive, e.g.","[549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557]"
"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSDuring the two academic years (1975-76, 1979-80) I spent with The British
Council in Tbilisi as well as in the course of other trips, such as my 3month sabbatical there at the end of 1987 through the auspices of The
British Academy, I came to know many Georgians, Mingrelians and Svans
whom I regarded as dear friends and from whom I learned a great deal
about Georgian and Georgia, whether or not they were conscious of their
role as teachers! Under normal circumstances I would have been happy to
list them all in the expectation that it might have gratified them to see their
names in such a book. However, circumstances have changed, and, since I
would not wish to embarrass anyone, I shall merely say that my gratitude
remains undimmed and that any Kartvelian who is still interested in
receiving thanks from me may consider themselves included in this
anonymous list.
Dr. Rieks Smeets (Leiden University) was kind enough to read an early
draft of chapter 5 and offer some helpful comments thereon. Thea Bynon's
advice was, as anyone who knows her would naturally expect, especially
valuable. Professor Donald Rayfield (Queen Mary Westfield, London
University) cast his experienced eye over the whole manuscript and was a
source of constant encouragement during the preparation of the work.
Mrs. Joyce Hutchinson exhibited great patience in bringing the text into
conformity with the requirements of the publishers, and SOAS was kind
enough to support this publication by generously reimbursing her for so
doing. Mrs. Catherine Lawrence of SOAS' Department of Geography
enthusiastically made her skills available by drawing the map for this
volume. And finally without the understanding of my long-suffering wife,
Zaira, and daughters, Amra and Gunda, for my almost umbilical attachment
to the computer-console while this book was gestating, its birth would have
been considerably delayed. I thank all concerned and alone take the blame
for any mistakes outstanding.

Georgian belongs to the South Caucasian (Kartvelian) language-family,
whose other three members are Svan, Laz and Mingrelian, the last two of
which are sometimes treated, especially by linguists in Georgia, as dialects
of the so-called Zan language. The schema (after Deeters 1930) in Table 1
shews the generally accepted path of historical divergences.
For discussions of the diachronic and inter-family relationships see
Schmidt (1962; 1978), Ts'ereteli (1966), who examines the ideas of
Gamq'relidze and Mač'avariani (1966), and Vogt (1967). Despite many
attempts, no-one has yet succeeded in proving a genetic relationship
between Kartvelian and any other language or language-family even within
the area of the Caucasus, let alone further afield, for example the
Georgian-Basque hypothesis, of which accessible critiques are available
from Vogt (1955 or 1988) and Rayfield (1990). The four languages are
together spoken over a relatively small, compact area, which in the main is
centred on the Republic of Georgia, from 1921 to the break-up of the
Soviet Union one of its three Transcaucasian republics. Exceptions to this
are: (a) Laz, which, apart from a negligible number of speakers within
Georgia, is confined to Lazistan, where an unknown, though perhaps
sizeable number of speakers inhabit the coastal strip running roughly from
Rize eastwards to the (Soviet/)Georgian frontier in modern-day Turkey; (b)
Fereydanian, the Georgian dialect spoken in Iran by the descendants of
those transported from East Georgia in the 17th century by Shah Abbas; (c)
Imerxevian, the Georgian dialect spoken by ethnic Georgians in those
provinces that have been part of Turkey since the 16th century; (d)
Ingiloan, the Georgian dialect spoken in the Zakatala region of
Azerbaydzhan; (e) Qizlar-Mozdokian, an obsolescent Georgian dialect
spoken in the north-central Caucasus by descendants of those who sought
safety there from East Georgia in the 18th century. Small émigrécommunities of Georgians live in Germany, France and America, whilst a
considerable number of Georgian Jews are to be found in Israel.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

'when my friend introduced us to each other..'.
A subtle interplay between affixal marking and preverb sometimes
becomes relevant in such cases. In the non-Prešent Sub-Series the verb
'entrust' can take either mo- or mi-, the former when the verbal activity is
directed towards either 1st or 2nd person (or, more rarely, a 3rd person if
that 3rd person is in the vicinity of either speaker or addressee), whilst the
latter implies an action aimed away from speaker or addressee. This
means that, when prešented with a form like mimabareben, the listener
knows that the 1st person agreement-affix cannot be signalling an indirect
object, as motion towards 1st person would necessitate the preverb mo-.
Hence, this verb-form will be analysed as mi-m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en 'they
will entrust me to X/them', making the periphrasis unnecessary. On the
other hand, momabareben can only be analysed as mo-(Ø-)m-a-bareb-en 'they will entrust X/them to me'.
The esšentials of cross-referencing within the verb of upto three
external arguments have now been explained. More will be said at the
appropriate places about the specifics of Series 111 forms for Transitive
and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general. This section closes
with some further examples of agreement-patterns for different types of
Transitive and Intransitive verb-forms in Series I and II—try to spot just
the relevant affixes, ignoring other features like preverb, Version-vowel,
or Thematic Suffix that may be prešent:142GEORGI AN GRAMMAR

commentators as Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers, are
elements, consisting in all cases but one of the structure VC, which attach
directly to a root (or root + Causative-marker, or root + passive/inceptive
marker -d-) for all screeves in Series I. Since the Perfect of Transitives
is formed on the Prešent stem, most Transitives keep their Thematic Suffix
also in the Perfect. The verbal noun (Masdar) and participles for most
verbs also incorporate the relevant Thematic Suffix (in some cases in a
reduced guise), and, since Series III for monopersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Past Participle whilst that for bipersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Masdar, Thematic Suffixes are widely attested in Series
III for Intransitive (including Indirect and Stative) verbs. Two of the
Thematic Suffixes (with exceptions) even occur in Series 11. For these
reasons I judge the alternative names given above for these formants too
restrictive.
The Thematic Suffixes in use today with Transitive Verbs are: -eb,
-ob, -av, -am, -ev, -en, and -i. Those in this list are widely used; in
addition one can point to: (a) -em, found in parts of the paradigm for the
root 'give' (viz. Future mi-(0-0-)s-c-em PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)3rd.PERgive-TS(FUT) 'you will give X/them to Y/them' vs the equivalent Aorist mi(Ø-Ø-Ø-)e-c-i PREV-(you-3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)IOV-give-AORJNDIC
'you
gave X/them to Y/them'); (b) -op, found with the root for 'divide' (viz. ga(Ø-Ø-)q'-op PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)divide-TS(FUT) 'you will divide X/them'
vs Aorist ga-(Ø-Ø-)q'av-i 'you divided X/them')—this suffix also turns up
in part of the paradigm of the copula (e.g. the past participle q'-op-il-i
'having been, ex-' and the masdar q'-op-n-a 'being').
Whilst theGEORGIANmasdar does not normally distinguish active
(transitive) from passive (intransitive), there are a number of roots which
do possess their own passive/intransitive masdars. In these masdars one
finds the element -om occupying the slot normally taken by the Thematic
Suffix (i.e. between root and masdar-exponent -a). Consider the following:
(a-)(Ø-)dg-eb-i 'you (will) stand up' => vs a-dg-om-a 'standing up' (cf.
dg-om-a 'standing'), (mo-)(Ø-)k'vd-eb-i 'you (will) die' => (mo-)k'vd-oma 'dying'18, (Ø-)xt'-i 'you jump' => xt'-om-a 'jumping', (ga-)t'q'd-eb-a 'X
(will) break(s)' => (ga-)t'q'd-om-a 'breaking (intrans.)' vs (ga-)(0-0-)t'ex
'you (will) break X/them' => (ga-)t'ex-a 'breaking (trans.)', (mo-)(0-0-)axd-en 'you (will) effect X/them' => (mo-)xd-en-a 'effecting' vs (mo-)xdeb-a 'it (will) happen(s)' => (mo-)xd-om-a 'happening'. With this last it is
interesting to compare the verb-form ( g a - ) ( 0 - 0 - 0 - ) x d - i (N.B. the144GEORGIANGRAMMARdifferent Thematic Suffix as well as the structural analysis) (Prev-)(you3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)strip-TS 'you (will) remove article(s) of clothing X from
Y/them', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-a 'undressing', whereas we have
the intransitive form (ga-)(Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you (will) become X; you (will)
grow thin', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-om-a. However, for the
former meaning of this verb-form there exists the transitive (ga-)(00 - ) x d - i 'you (will) render X/them Y' (e.g. u+en+o-s
ga-g-xd-i-s
speechless-DAT PREV-you-render-X(FUT) 'X will render you speechless').
Yet it would seem that in this instance the Masdar in -om is also used
transitively—KEGl quotes this example for C'avč'avadze:
še+i+jl+eb+a st'umar-i jm-ad
mi-(Ø-)i-tvis-o-s

'It's possible for a man to accept a guest as a brother, but, as for
making him (his) master, he will die and (still) not deign to do this'
In the case of šr-om-a the word is viewed today more as an abstractnoun 'work(ing)' than as the Masdar of (Ø-Ø-)š'vr-eb-i 'you do X'.
There are a few verbs that employ in places the seeming Thematic
Suffix -ol (e.g. kar-i kr-i-s 'the wind blows' => kr-ol-a 'blowing' and cf.
the Future kar-i i-kr-ol-eb-s 'the wind will blow'; g-q'+av-s 'you have
animate X/them' => q'-ol-a 'having (something animate)' and cf. the Future
g-e-q'-ol-eb-a 'you will have animate X/them'; (Ø-Ø-)i-svr-i 'you hurl
X/them' => sr-ol-a 'throwing' and cf. the Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sr-ol-eb 'you
will hurl X/them'; (da-)(Ø-)c'v-eb-i 'you (will) lie down' => da-c'-ol-a
'lying down' (cf. c'-ol-a 'lying')).
Another suffix that might be regarded as (at least akin to) a Thematic
Suffix is -il, but this too today has more of the force of an abstract-noun
formant—it is particularly common with Stative verbs, and sometimes it
combines with the prefix si- (e.g. tav-i g-t'k'iv-a head-NOM you-pain-it
'your head aches' => t'k'iv-il-i '(being in) pain', (Ø-)dum-x-a+r yoube.silent-you-be 'you are silent' => dum-il-i '(being in) silence', (Ø-)k'vdeb-i 'you die' => si-k'vd-il-i 'death', (Ø-)i-rb-en 'you will run' => either
si-rb-il-i or rb-en-a 1 9 , g-ši-a 'you are hungry' => ši-mš-il-i <= *si-msil-i, for the bilabial nasal cf. mš-ier-i 'hungry' and (Ø-Ø-)a-mš-ev 'youVERBAl MORPHOlOGY145make X/them hungry'). In a few verbs the suffix -il seems to correlate
with -in in other parts of the paradigm (e.g. j(-)il-i 'sleep' vs g-j(-)inav-s 'you are asleep', korc'(-)il-i 'wedding-feast' vs da-korc'(-)in-dnen 'they got married' and gan-korc'(-)in-d-nen 'they got divorced').
The Thematic Suffix -i is clearly the exception in terms of its
structure, as well as being the one which is not carried over into the
Perfect. However, at first glance it may seem that this latter statement is
not correct (cf. ga-g-zrd-i-s PREV-you-rear-TS-X
'X will rear you',
which gives the Perfect ga-(Ø-)u-zrd-i-x-a+r 'X apparently (has) reared
you', where we still have an i-vowel immediately after the root. However,
this is no longer the Thematic Suffix but a Perfect-exponent, as we see if
we take any Transitive Perfect formed from roots coupled either with no
Thematic Suffix or any Thematic Suffix other than -av or -am in Series I
(e.g. for the Root Verb (da-)(0-0-)c'er 'you (will) write X/them' we have
the Perfect da-g-i-c'er-i-a 'you apparently wrote/have written X/them',
whilst for (ga-)(0-0-)a-k'et-eb 'you (will) do/make X/them' we have the
Perfect ga-g-i-k'et-eb-i-a 'you apparently (have) made X/them').
Of the Thematic Suffixes listed above -eb, or, more restrictedly, -ob
and -ev are also found in Series I screeves as part of the morphology of
Intransitive verbs—as indeed is the bilabial element of -am and the labio­
dental for some verbs in -av.
As to the original function of the Thematic Suffixes, the best
explanation so far advanced is that of Aronson (1979). To anticipate what
is made explicit in Chapter 5, a comparison of the syntax of Transitive and
Intransitive verbal classes for Series I screeves reveals that we are
dealing with a Nominative-Accusative configuration (the Nominative case
marks the subject of both Transitive and Intransitive Verbs, whilst the
direct object is marked differently, viz. by the Dative case). In Series II,
however, we have an Ergative-Absolutive alignment (transitive subjects
standing in the Ergative case, whilst intransitive subjects and direct objects
stand in the Nominative(-Absolutive)). The Dative case is, of course, also
used to mark the indirect object with the majority of finite verb-forms, and
the at first glance surprising fact that the Dative also marks the direct
object for Transitive Verbs in Series I screeves could be straightforwardly
explained, if in origin the relevant argument functioned as an indirect
object of what at the time would have been a bivalent intransitive verbform. Aronson illustrated an instance in OldGEORGIANwhere what today
would be regarded as a simple Dative direct object was evidently
interpreted as an indirect object thereby occasioning the Set B agreementprefix s- in the verb-form (namely:146GEORGI AN GRAMMARs-cv-i-d-es
3rd.PER-defend-3rd.PER-I MPERF-they
'they were defending the gates')i+gi-n-i
that-Pl-NOMbč'e-ta
gate-Pl(DAT)Taking, as commentators generally do, Series 11 with its ergativealignment to be basic in the language, Aronson suggested that what today
are clearly independently existing Series I transitive screeves with their
own restructured tense, and aspectual (sc. imperfective vs perfective)
oppositions (not to mention the active-passive dichotomy) were in origin all
derived intransitive, imperfective forms produced from the fundamental,
ergatively aligned Series 11 base-forms by an anti-passive transformation,
whose morphological markers were none other than today's Thematic
Suffixes. Series I direct objects were, thus, in origin indirect objects and
were naturally marked by the Dative; this case has simply continued to
mark the relevant entity, now reinterpreted as a direct object.
A given root will normally be used for a given meaning always with the
same Thematic Suffix, even though it sometimes happens that dialects
employ for a given root a Thematic Suffix different from the one generally
in use, and Root Verbs are sometimes assigned a Thematic Suffix, often
-av (e.g. for (Ø-Ø-)t'ex 'you break X/them' one may meet (Ø-Ø-)t'exav). However, we have already given one example where the suffix -av
was replaced by -eb when an indirect object governed by the locative
Versional vowel a- was associated with the root in question. Two parallel
examples would be (še-)(0-0-)k'er-av (PREV-)(you-3rd.PER-)sew-TS 'you
(will) sew X/them' => (da-)(0-0-0-)a-k'er-eb
(PREV-)(you-3rd.PER3rd.PER-)lV-sew-TS 'you (will) sew X/them on Y/them' (cf. the metaphorical

3.4 Postpositions(tan+d+eb+ul-eb-i)Adpositions inGEORGIANare almost always postpositional. They either
stand as separate words, in which case some of those governing the
Genitive may for stylistic reasons be placed before the noun or
demonstrative pronoun (both in the long form of the Genitive) they govern,
or are attached to their governed (pro)noun; such clitic postpositions are
written here with a hyphen. Postpositions govern a specific case, the most
commonly governed cases being the Genitive and Dative. When an
association with certain elements produces a commonly used adverb, as
seen in some examples from section 3.3, no case-marker appears (e.g.
gušin-c'in 'the day before yesterday'). However, if we wish to build on
this adverb to form the expression for '3 days ago', the Genitive ending is
used before the second occurrence of the postposition (e.g. gušin-c'in-is
c'in).
3.4.1 Postpositions with theNOMINATIVE(saxel+ob+it-i)
The only postposition that can take theNOMINATIVEis -vit 'like, as', and
then this is only possible for consonant-final stems (e.g. xar-i-vit 'like a
bull'), where theNOMINATIVEis an alternative to the Dative, which case
must be used for vowel-final stems.
Nouns can be used in apposition to other nouns or pronouns preceded
by ro+gor+c 'as, like'. Clearly the appositional case will often be the
NOMINATIVE e.g.
č ven
v-šr+om-ob-t
ugl-is
kve+š
we(NOm) lst.PER-toil-TS-PL(PRES) yoke-GEN under
xar-i
bull-NOm
'we toil beneath the yoke like a bull'ro+gor + c
like3.4.2 Postpositions with the Genitive (na+tes+a+ob+it-i)
Clitic postpositions are suffixed to either the short or long form of the
Genitive. Free-standing postpositions take the short form of the Genitive,
though the long form will be used when those than can stand
prepositionally are so placed. In association with personal pronouns, the
interrogative pronouns vin? 'who?' and ra? 'what?' or with demonstrative
pronouns in the plural, the pronominal stem seen in the relevant possessive
adjective is used alone with clitic postpositions, whilst a final -s is today
regularly added when these pronouns are governed by a free-standing70GEORGIANGRAmmARpostposition (e.g. čem-tvis 'for me' vs čem(-s) ga(+)mo 'because of me' <=
čem-i 'my').
- t v i s 'for' (e.g. kal-is(a)-tvis 'for the woman', u č a - s ( a ) - t v i s 'for
Ucha', i-eb-is(a)-tvis 'for the violets', a+m-is(a)-tvis 'for this one', m is-tvis 'for him/her/it', m a - t - t v i s 'for them', i+ma-t-tvis 'for those
(ones)'). See 5.1.5 for its role as a marker of indirect objects.
-gan means 'from' in the sense of:
(a) physical separation from people, e.g.
čven-gan šor+s nu
us-from
far
not(PROH)
'don't go far from us'c'a-x-val
PREV-you-go(FUT)(b) material from which something is made (e.g. x-is(a)-gan 'from/of
wood', r k ' i n - i s ( a ) - g a n 'from/of iron'); (c) source (e.g. šiš-is(a)-gan
'from/out of fear', si+rcxv+il-is(a)-gan 'from/out of shame'). It is the
standard postposition with the verb 'consist of', e.g.
sa+kon+el-i
še-dg-eb-od-a
ert-i
tx-isa-gan
livestock-NOm PREV-consist.of-TS-IMPERF-it
1-AGR goat-GEN-from
da or-i
jrox-isa-gan
and 2-AGR cow-GEN-from
'the livestock consisted of one goat and two cows'
It may also mark the agent with passive verbs, Privative Participles or
masdars (e.g. šen-gan da+u+t'ir+eb+el-i 'unwept for by you', t k v e n - i
ga+mo+gzavn+a me+p-is(a)-gan 'your sending (= being sent) here by
the king').
ga(+)mo, which may not be preposed, states a reason (e.g. s e n - i s
ga(+)mo 'because of disease', i+m-is ga(+)mo 'because of that', m - i s
ga(+)mo 'because of him/her/it').
še+deg+ad, the Adverbial case of the noun še+deg-i 'result', gives us
the pseudo-postposition meaning 'as a result' (e.g. av+ad+m+q'op+ob-is
še+deg+ad 'as a result of illness').
mi+mart (but mo+mart when governing a 1st person pronoun), which
may not be preposed, means '(directed) towards' usually in a non-spatial,
metaphorical sense, e.g.
ara+vitar-i
no-AGRmt'r+ul-i
grjn+ob+a
ara
hostile-AGR feeling(NOm) notm-a-kv-s
I-LV-have-it(PRES)NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY71tkven(-s)/mezobl-is
mi+mart
you.PL(-GEN3 )/neighbour-GEN towards
'I have no hostile feeling towards you/the neighbour'
Synonymous with the preceding postposition is -da+mi, which is the
form used with the personal pronouns (e.g. int'eres-i/si+q'var+ul-i
č e m - d a + m i / š e n - d a + m i / m - i s - d a + m i / m a - t - d a + m i 'interest in/love
towards me/you/X/them'). With ordinary nouns or demonstrative pronouns
the form used is -ad + mi (e.g. int'eres-i/si+jul+v+il-i
kal-eb-isad+mi/a+m-is-ad+mi 'interest in/hatred towards women/this one'). In
OldGEORGIAN-da plus Genitive fulfilled the same role as -tvis, as it still
does in some dialects and as parallel formations regularly do in the other
Kartvelian languages. It is this -da we have in such expressions as
tkven-da sa+u+bed+uro-d 'unfortunately for you', seen in 3.2.5.
garda means 'apart from' (e.g. a+m q'ut-eb-is garda 'apart from
these boxes'). It is often preposed in the phrase garda i+m-isa (= i+mis garda), rom 'apart from that (sc. the fact) that'. It is sometimes found
with the Dative (e.g. a+ma-s garda 'apart from this').
- k ' e n means 'towards' in a spatial, directional sense (e.g.
da+sa+vl+et-is(a)-k'en 'westwards', čven(-s)-k'en 'towards us', m - i s k'en 'towards X').
mier, which may not be preposed, marks the agent with passives (e.g.
v-is mier da-i-c'er-a? 'by whom was it written?', vova-s mier mo-k'lul-i 'killed by Vova').
áe+sa+x+eb, which may not be preposed, means 'about, concerning'
(e.g. r-is áe+sa+x+eb? 'concerning what?', p'olit'ik'-is še+sa+x+eb
'about politics'). Cf. -ze in 3.4.2.
-tana+ve is used with masdars and means 'as soon as' (cf. 5.2.2.1.7.2).
irgvl+iv or gar+še+mo, which may not be preposed, mean 'around'
(e.g. jir-eb-is irgvl+iv/gar+áe+mo 'around the roots').
gare+t, which may not be preposed, means 'outside' (kalak-is gare+t
'outside the town').
gare+še, which is not absolutely excluded from being preposed, means
'without' (e.g. xumr+ob-is gare+še 'without joking', šen(-s) gare+še
'without you' = u-šen-o-d, which is the Adverbial case of the privative
adjective; pul-is gare+še - u-pul-o-d 'without money'). It may also be
used as a synonym for gare+t (e.g. ezo-s gare+áe 'outside the yard').
c'in, which is not preposable, means 'before' either temporally or
spatially (e.g. gada+c+em-is c'in 'before the programme', k'las-is c'in
'in front of the class'—N.B. the lack of any Genitive marker in the common
phrases tval-c'in 'before (one's) eye(s)' and cxvir-c'in 'in front of (one's)72GEORGIANGRAmmARnose'). The variant c'ina+t is restricted to a temporal sense (e.g. xut-i
c'l-is c'in(a+t) '5 years before/ago')—N.B. the expression with the Dative
a+ma-s c'ina+t 'just now, recently'. The variant c'ina+áe is used only in
the spatial sense of 'before' = 'in front' (e.g. k'reb-is c'in(a+Se) 'in front
of the meeting').
uk'an, which is not preposable, means 'behind' (e.g. čem(-s) uk'an
'behind me', sa+tb+ur-is uk'an 'behind the greenhouse'). It is sometimes
used like še+m+deg 'after' (e.g. cot'a xn-is uk'an 'after a little while').
i+k+it, less commonly mi+gma, neither of which is preposable, means
'on that side, beyond'; the former is also used with the Dative (e.g. t'q'is/t'q'e-s i+k+it 'beyond the wood', ok'ean-is mi+gma 'beyond the
ocean').
ga+gma/gada+gma, neither of which may be preposed, also mean
'beyond, on the far side' and are usually used with nouns signifying natural
barriers, like 'river/road/mountain/gorge', not that the two preceding
postpositions are prohibited from appearing with such nouns (e.g. tergis/mt-is
ga(da)+gma/i+k+it/mi+gma
'on the far side of the
Terek/mountain').
a+k+et, less commonly mo+gma, neither of which is preposable, means
'on this side; after, since (temporally)'; the former is also used with the
Dative (e.g. t'q'-is/t'q'e-s a+k+et 'on this side of the wood', ok'ean-is
mo+gma 'on this side of the ocean', m-is-i si+k'vd+il-is a+k+et = m-is
si+k'vd+il-s a+k+et 'after/since X's death').
ga+mo+gma/gad+mo+gma, neither of which may be preposed, also
mean 'on this side of' and are usually used with nouns signifying natural
barriers, though the preceding two postpositions are also permitted in this
context (e.g. terg-is/mt-is
ga+mo+gma/gad+mo+gma/a+k+et/mo+
gma 'on this side of the Terek/mountain').
šfe+m+deg, which is not preposable, means 'after' (e.g. v a x š m - i s
áe+m+deg 'after dinner').
mi+xed+v+it, which is not preposable, means 'according to' (e.g.
mi+g+eb+ul-i azr-is mi+xed+v+it 'according to the received opinion').
When used with the demonstrative pronouns, the pronoun's Genitive ending
is often reinforced by -da (e.g. a+m-is(-da) mi+xed+v+it 'according to
this').
mi + u+xed + av + ad, which is the Adverbial case of the Privative
Participle of the verb meaning 'look to', whose masdar in the Instrumental
case provided the preceding postposition, means 'in spite of'. Governed
personal and demonstrative pronouns are often reinforced by -da (e.g.
mraval-i p'roblem-is mi+u+xed+av+ad = mi+u+xed+av+ad
mraval-i p'roblem-isa 'despite several problems', šen(-s)/šen-da73NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYm i + u + x e d + a v + a d 'in spite of you', i + m a - t ( - s ) / i + m a - t - d a
mi+u+xed+av+ad 'in spite of those').
gverd+it/gverd+ze, neither of which is preposable, mean 'beside' (e.g.
čven(-s) gverd+it/gverd+ze 'beside us', bič'-is gverd+it/gverd+ze
'beside the boy').
kve+sVkve+v+it, neither of which is preposable, mean 'under­
neath/below'; they are also found with the Dative (e.g. sa + c' + o l is/sa+c'+ol-s kve+á 'underneath the bed', panǰr-is kve+v+it 'below
the window', c'arb-s kve+v+it 'below the eyebrow').
ze+v+it, which is not preposable, means 'above'; it is also found with
the Dative (e.g. panǰr-is ze+v+it 'above the window', c'arb-s ze+v+it
'above the eyebrow').
ga+sc'vr+iv, which is not preposable, means 'along' (e.g. m+din+ar-is
ga+sc'vr+iv 'along the river').
p'ir + da + p'ir, which is not preposable, means 'straight in front,
opposite' (e.g. buxr-is p'ir+da+p'ir 'straight in front of/opposite the
fireplace').
mag+ier(+ad)/mag+ivr+ad/na+cvl+ad, none of which is preposable,
mean 'instead' (e.g. me+p-is
mag+ier(+ad)/mag+ivr+ad/na+cvl+ad
'instead of the king').
c'ina+ag+m+deg, which is not preposable, means 'against' (tkven(-s)
c'ina+ag+m+deg 'against you', t'alg-is c'ina+ag+m+deg cur+v+a
'swimming against the tide').
axlo+s, which is not preposable, means 'near' (e.g. i-is axlo+s 'near
the violet').
It is also used in association with the Dative-taking
postposition -tan (e.g. kal-tan a+s+e axlo+s 'so close (as this) to the
woman').
amara, which is not preposable, means 'possessing/provided only
with/wearing only' (e.g. mart'o+k'a áarvl-is amara 'alone with only (his)
trousers', mo+di+od+a xanǰl-is amara 'X was coming possessed of only
a dagger',
gam-is
p'erang-is amara
še-mo-i-čr-a
night-GEN shirt-GEN
wearing PREV-PREV-PASS-rush.in-X(AOR)
'X rushed in wearing only a night-shirt').
a+na+bar+a 'abandoned to', which looks to be related to (ča-)bareb-a 'entrust(ing), deposit(ing)', e.g.
keto-s
Keto-DATmama
mo-(Ø-)u-k'vd-a,
father(NOm) PREV-(her-)OV-die-he(AOR)da
and74GEORGIANGRAmmARda-rč-a

PREV-remain-she(AOR) step.mother-GEN
abandoned.to
'Keto's father died, and she was left abandoned to/in the hands of (her)
step-mother'
in the phrase 'abandoned to God', a final -s may be added (viz. gvt-is
a+na+bar+a(+s)).
sa+šua+1+eb+it/me+áv+e+ob+it/me+ox+eb+it/da+xmar+eb+it/
àe+m+c'+e+ob+it/c'q'al+ob+it 'by means of' (e.g. gvt-is sa+šua+l+eb+
it/me+áv+e+ob+it/me+ox+eb+it/da+xmar+eb+it/áe+m+c'+e+ob+it/
c'q'al+ob+it 'by means/ with the help of God'). None is preposable.
mizn+it, which is not preposable, is used with masdars as a non-finite
representation of purpose. Some commentators condemn this usage as a
calque on Russian expressions of purpose with s ceVju (e.g. q'vela-s
mo+t'q'u+eb-is mizn+it 'for the purpose of deceiving everybody').
sc'or+s, which may not be preposed, is used to express the notion 'a
week from' with certain expressions of time (e.g. dge-is sc'or+s 'a week
from today', xval-is sc'or+s 'a week from tomorrow', otx+šabat-is
sc'or+s 'a week from Wednesday').
-(m)ebr is an archaic synonym for -vit. It is still found regularly in
the expression čv+e+ul+eb-isa-mebr 'as is the/X's custom; customarily'.
Cf. čem-ebr 'like me' (= čem-sa-vit, dem-nair-ad, dem-eb+ur-ad,
see 3.9.2 for the last two formations).
3.4.3 Postpositions with the Dative (mi+c+em+it-i)-ši means 'in'. The Dative desinence -s actually disappears before this
postposition for all nouns, for the demonstrative pronouns, and for the
interrogative pronoun ra? 'what?', but it is retained for the 3rd person
singular personal pronoun and in the interrogative vin? 'who?'; for 1st and
2nd person pronouns and for the plural of both the 3rd person personal
pronoun and the demonstrative pronouns the stem of the relevant
possessive adjective is used (e.g. saxl-ši 'in the house', m c x e t a - š i 'in
mtsxeta', a+ma-ši 'in this', maġa-ši 'in that (by you)', i+ma-Si 'in that',
ra-ši? 'in what?', ma-s-ái 'in X', vi-s-äi? 'in whom?', dven-ši 'in/among
us', ma-t-ši 'in/among them', a+ma-t-ši 'in/among these'). When -c 'and,
also, even' is added, the sequence may take the form -ši(+(d)a)-c.
-ze means 'on'. In expressions of comparison it is translated as 'than';
it can also be used as a synonym for še+sa+x+eb 'concerning, about'.
The Dative desinence is present or absent in exactly the same
circumstances as just described for -ši (e.g. sa+xur+av-ze 'on the roof',NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY75mcxeta-ze ra-s amb-ob? 'what are you saying about mtsxeta?', m a - s ze ara+per-s v-amb-ob 'I am saying nothing about it', a+ma-ze 4 didi/u-did-es-i 'bigger than this'). When -c 'and, also, even' is added, the
sequence may take the form -ze(+da)-c.
-tan means 'by, with, at' in the sense of German bei, French chez.
The Dative desinence is lost for consonant-final nouns, but is kept with
vowel-final nouns and the singular of both the 3rd person personal and the
demonstrative pronouns. For 1st and 2nd person pronouns and the plural
of both the 3rd person personal and the demonstrative pronouns the stem
of the possessive adjective is used (e.g. zurab-tan 'by Zurab/at Zurab's',
vova-s-tan 'by Vova/at Vova's', ma-s-tan 'by X/at X's', maġa-s-tan 'by
that one/at that one's place', Sen-tan 'by you/at your place', ma-t-tan 'by
them/at their place', i+ma-t-tan 'by them/at their place'), tana+c is used
adverbially to mean 'at the same time, additionally', and tan alone means
'along, together with', e.g.
cign-i
tan
c'a-(Ø-)i-g-o
book-NOm along PREV-(it-)SV-take-X(AOR)
'X took the book along with him/her/it'
šoris which is not preposable, preferably means 'among' and
secondarily 'between'. 1st and 2nd person pronouns usually end in -s (e.g.
megobr-eb-s šoris 'among/between friends', čven-s šoris 'among/
between us', šen-sa da čem-s áoris 'between you and me', mcxeta-sa
da gor-s Soris 'between mtsxeta and Gori'). The Genitive may also be
used, and Vogt quotes some conjoined phrases in which one conjunct is
Dative, the other Genitive (e.g. k'ap'it'alizm-sa da socializm-is áoris
'between capitalism and socialism').
Sua, which is not preposable, preferably means 'between' and
secondarily 'among', though today this and the previous postposition can be
regarded as interchangeable. 1st and 2nd person pronouns usually end in
-s, and again the Genitive may also be used (e.g. alazan-sa da ior-s Sua
'between the Alazani and I ori (sc. rivers)', jm-is col-sa da tav-is Sua
'between (his) brother's wife(=DAT) and himself(=GEN)\ tkven-s Sua
'between you', ma-t Sua 'between them', maġa-t Sua 'between those (by
you)').
-vit 'like, as' takes the Dative as an alternative to theNOMINATIVEfor
consonant-final nouns and obligatorily in all other cases. In all instances
the Dative is shewn by the long form -sa (e.g. xar-sa-vit 'like a bull',
bavšv-sa-vit 'like a child', xbo-sa-vit 'like a calf', čem-sa-vit 'like me',
ma-sa-vit 'like X', ma-t-sa-vit [sic] 'like them', i+ma-sa-vit 'like that').","[87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"

appropriate with screeves in Series I and 11 (e.g. sp'ilo-s i+k-ve šv+l-i
(Ø-)u-c'ev-s 'its child is lying right there by the elephant', datv-i mtel-i
si+mjim-it ze+d (Ø-)a-c'v-a mo+nadir+e-s 'the bear was lying upon
the hunter with all its weight'); in addition, in the Future Sub-Series and in
Series II the Indirect Object Version vowel may serve in the role of both
the above-versions (e.g. deda-s baväv-i (Ø-)e-c'v-a muxl-eb-ze 'the
baby was lying upon its mother's knees')—a by-form for the Future (Ø-)ec'v-eb-a is (Ø-)e-c'-ol-eb-a 241
Do not confuse the bivalent Prešent in Objective Version with the
Objective Version of the Transitive Verb (Ø-Ø-)s-c'-ev 'you draw X/them'
(e.g. ešv-eb-is še+m+c'+e+ob-it sp'ilo mjime ra+me-eb-s (Ø-)s-c'ev-s 'an elephant drags heavy things with the aid of its tusks', k'at'a-m

(as in pex-eb-s rom (Ø-Ø-)m-i-c'-ev, ra č'ida+ob-is c'es-i-a? 'what

GiveMasdar = mi-/mo-c-em-a 'giving (implying some recipient)', whereas gac-em-a is used when the recipient is not so prominent (e.g. brjan+ebis/gan+k'arg+ul+eb-is ga-c-em-a 'issuing of a command/instruction',
p'asux-is ga-c-em-a 'giving a response', xm-is ga-c-em-a 'giving
voice'). Cf. gada-c-em-a 'handing on; programme, broadcast', g a - m o - c em-a 'publishing; publication' 246 , d a - c - e m - a 'collapse, fall, ruin(ation),
destruction'. For the simple šense of 'giving', the roots are -)l-, normally
restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series, vs - c - elsewhere; the latter combines
with a new Thematic Suffix, -em, in the Future Sub-Series and Perfect (the
regular choice also has to be made outside the Prešent Sub-Series between464GEORGIANGRAMMARmo- and mi-), whereas the former is used with -ev and locative Version.
A further oddity is the appearance in part of the Aorist Indicative
paradigm of this Transitive Verb of the Indirect Object Versioniser, and

The above-paradigm with its suppletive root outside the Prešent SubSeries is the norm. However, KEGl quotes for the root -)l- an Aorist (ØØ-Ø-)a-)l-i-e = mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)e-c-i as well as a Perfect g-i-)l-ev-i-a
-tvis = mi-g-i-c-i-a -tvis. Also there is še-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)l-ev 'you wIII
ask X/them to accept Y/them' (e.g. deda=šem-ma ekim-s pul-i še-(ØØ-)a-jl-i-a 'my mother asked the doctor to accept (the) money') => Aorist
äe-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-jl-i-e => Perfect še-g-i-)l-ev-i-a -tvis. These forms
are not to be confused with (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)al-eb 'you (wIII) force
X/them on Y/them' (cf. (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-)al-eb-i 'you (wIII) force
yourself on X/them').
Do not confuse the Prešent Sub-Series forms given above with the
Transitive Verb (da-)(Ø-Ø-)s-)l-ev 'you (wIII) overcome/get the better
of/gain control of X/them'. This verb can be used without the preverb
even in the usually perfective screeves; the peculiarity is that, if there is
no preverb, then the second argument (viz. that which is overcome) in
Series II stands in the Dative, e.g.
bage-s k'b+il-i

(?3rd.PER-)itovercome-TS-X(AOR)
tav-s
self-DAT
'X bit his lip but I noticed (?on him) that he got control of himself'
whereas, if the preverb is employed, the second argument in Series II
stands in the Nominative (e.g. p'art'ia-m da-(Ø-)(?s-)jl-i-a mt'r-eb-is
c'ina + a g + m + deg + oba 'the Party overcame the opposition of (its)
enemies').
The participles with preverb mo- for IIIustrative purposes are: Active
mo-m-c-em-i, Future mo-sa-c-em-i, Privative mo-u-c-em-el-i (with
syncopating -e-), Past mo-c-em-ul-i or mo-na-c-em-i, which latter is
used nominally in the šense of 'datum'.
In the Prešent Sub-Series the verb 'give' may be used as a 'deponent'466GEORGI AN GRAMMARverb, which is to say that it has Intransitive/Passive morphology of the
prefixal type but is used in the šense of a verb with active voice taking a
subject and direct object only (e.g. sa+minist'r+o up+1+eba-s (?Ø-)i-)lev-a 'the Ministry gives its authority', rč+ev+a-s v-(?Ø-)i-)l-ev-i 'I am
giving (out) advice', magalit-s (?Ø-)i-)l-e-od-nen 'they were giving an
example', q'ana ga+m+jl+e p'ur-s (?Ø-)i-)l-ev-a 'the field produces
hardy wheat').
Otherwise the 'normal' bivalent Intransitive form with passive meaning
'X is given to Y' (or possibly reflexive 'X gives oneself up to Y') conjugates
thus:

Know (facts)247
Masdar = c+od+n-a.
In origin the Prešent Sub-Series forms of this verb belonged to Series II
and have retained their original syntax such that the subject stands in the
Ergative and the direct object (always 3rd person in ModernGEORGIAN)in
the Nominative; the same applies to an alternative, though less common,
verb for 'knowing', which also mirrors the morphology of its more common
synonym but tends to be found only with 3rd person subject and
specifically in such phrases as g m e r t - m a / a l a h - m a (Ø-)uc'q'-i-s 2 4 8
'God/Allah knows!'.

The Prešent Sub-Series screeves have a colloquial usage seen in such
examples as svan+et-ši did-i tovl-i (Ø-)i-c-i-s 'there is heavy snow in
Svanetia usually', where the regularly occurring noun stands in the
Nominative and the place where it occurs is not, as might be expected,
Ergative but governed by the postposition -šl.
Say
Masdar = tk-m-a
To express this notion three separate roots are used: (i) - a m b - (cf.
ambav-i, GEN = amb-isa 'news, report'—cf. ra ambav-i-a? 'what's
going on?') + Thematic Suffix -ob in the Prešent Sub-Series vs (ii) -t'q'v(cf. si+t'q'v+a 'word, speech') in the Future Sub-Series vs (iii) -tk(v)- +

Masdar = tk-m-a (-tvis)
Four roots are employed to convey this meaning. In Series III the
paradigms just prešented for 'say' are used in association with the
postposition -tvis governing the Genitive for the notional indirect object (=
recipient of the message). In the Prešent Sub-Series the root is -ubn-,
which, though trivalent, takes the form of a bipersonal prefixal IntransitiveVERBAl MORPHOlOGY471Verb; in the Future Sub-Series the root is again - t ' q ' v - but with the
Indirect Object Version vowel governing the indirect object; in Series II
the equivalent forms of the verb (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-txr-ob (= (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-q'veb-i or (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-amb-ob) 'you relate/narrate X/them to Y/them' are
used—the Aorist Indicative is Strong but with 3rd person singular subject
in -a and with the root expanded by -a- when the subject is 1st or 2nd

(Ø-)e-kn-a-tThe Intransitive/Passive form of this last root provides the copula with
its Future Sub-Series forms, whilst in association with a Transitive Verb's
Past Participle these same Future Sub-Series forms or their Series 11VERBAl MORPHOlOGY473counterparts (viz. Aorist Indicative i-kn-a 'it was done', Aorist Subjunctive
i-kn-a-s/i-kn-e-s 'it may be done') allow a (dynamic) passive voice to be
constructed, which may serve as the only passive voice for some verbs
even though in general this formation is regarded as rather bookish. An
example would be gamsaxurdia p'rezident'-ad a-rč-e-ul(-i) i-kn-a
(i-kn-eb-a) 'Gamsaxurdia was (wIII be) elected president', where we note
that the participle usually (but not obligatorily) loses its i-suffix if it
immediately precedes the auxiliarly verb 2 5 3 . 'Elect' has no synthetic
passive, but in speech the above-construction would normally be avoided in
favour of the equivalent active voice verb with indefinite 3rd person plural
subject (viz. gamsaxurdia p'rezident'-ad a-(Ø-)i-rč-i-es (Future =
gamsaxurdia-s p'rezident'-ad a-(Ø-)i-rč-ev-en)).
Active Participle = m-k(m)n-el-i, Future Participle = sa-k(m)n-el-i,
Privative Participle = u-k(m)n-el-i, Past Participle = kmn-il-i.
By using the Objective Version with -the basic forms already set out in
Series I we produce the verb-forms meaning 'do X to Y' (e.g. ra-s (Ø-ØØ-)u-švr-eb-i/(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-zam? 'what are you doing/wIII you do to
X/them?', ra-sa-c šen (Ø-Ø-)m-i-zam me, me šen (Ø-)g-i-zam
sa+mag+ier+o-d 'what you (wIII) do to me, I shall do to you in return'). In
Series III this meaning is rendered by adding the notional indirect object
as a Genitive dependent on the postposition -tvis to the verb-forms set
out above. However, in Series 11 resort has to be make to the root
-q'(a)v-, the original Intransitive/Passive form of which provides the
copula with its Series II forms:

time'. However, if the 'doing X to Y' is to be understood as 'taking Y
somewhere', then somewhat counterintuitively 'Y' stands not in the Dative
but the Nominative 254 (e.g. ra (Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-q'av-i mundir-i? 'What have
you done with = where have you put the uniform?').
This last root has a full range of screeves across the three Series in
such compounds as še+u+racx-(Ø-Ø-)q'-op 'you (wIII) insult X/them'474GEORGIANGRAMMAR(Aorist še+u+racx-(Ø-Ø-)q'av-i, Perfect še+u+racx-g-i-q'v-i-a),
u+zrun+v+ei-(Ø-Ø-)q'-op 'you (will) safeguard X/them', uar-(Ø-Ø-)q'op 'you (wIII) reject/deny X/them', where the first element is an
incorporated noun/adjective. Participles are of the shape: Prešent = uarm-q'-op-(el-)i, Future = uar-sa-q'-op-(el-) i (both with syncopating
-e-), Past = uar-q'-op-il-i.

Masdar = (imperfective) xed-v-a 2 5 5 vs (perfective) nax-v-a
In the Prešent Sub-Series -xed- (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)xed-av 'you see X/them'
behaves just like any Transitive Verb with Thematic Suffix -av, whilst
elsewhere -nax- (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)nax-av 'you wIII see X/them', (Ø-Ø-)nax-e
'you saw X/them', g-i-nax-av-s 'you have seen X/them') equally behaves
just like any Transitive Verb with Thematic Suffix -av, except that no
preverb is used.
Both the roots just given are used with preverbs, but the meanings are
specific. (še-)(Ø-Ø-)i-nax-av = 'you (wIII) put X/them somewhere for
safe keeping'; in the šense of 'you notice/observe X/them' we have (ØØ-)xed-av (etc..) again in the Prešent (Sub-Series) but in the Future (SubSeries plus Series II and III) this becomes da-(Ø-Ø-)i-nax-av etc... In
perfective screeves mo-(Ø-Ø-)nax-av etc... is used in the šense of '(you
wIII) find X/them by searching'. 'look' in the Prešent Sub-Series is
indicated by the Intransitive forms of the root -xed- (e.g. kor-i jir-s ixed-eb-a 'the hawk is looking down', p'olit'ik'a-s'i še+cd+om+a rom
ar da-(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-a, c'in u+nd+a (Ø-)i-xed-eb-od-e 'so that you
don't make a mistake in politics, you should (always) be looking forward')—
these forms can also be used as true/potential passives (e.g. t v a l - i t
a+gara+per-i i-xed-eb-a 'nothing can be seen any more with the eye').
However, outside the Prešent Sub-Series 'look' is indicated by the active
Transitive form of this same root in Subjective Version (sc. in the Future
Sub-Series and Series II) and with the preverb appropriate to the direction
of the gaze, for example m o - is used for 'hither' or 'back' (e.g. kal-ma mo(?Ø-)i-xed-a 256 'the woman looked (back/this way)', kal-s mo-(Ø-)uxed-av-s 'the woman has looked (back/this way)'); if we wish to indicate
what is being looked at with such verbs, we simply add an indirect object,
whose marker in the Future Sub-Series and in Series II replaces the
Subjective Version vowel (e.g. kal-ma mo-(?Ø-)m-xed-a 'the woman
looked (back/this way) at me', kal-s čem-tvis mo-(Ø-)u-xed-av-s 'the
woman has looked (back/this way) at me'). da-(Ø-Ø-)xed-e(-t) as the
Imperative which strictly means 'look down at X/them' is often abbreviated
to da-(Ø-Ø-)xe(-t) and used in the šense of 'just look there!'. TheVERBAl MORPHOlOGY475Intransitive Prešent i-nax-eb-a may mean 'X is being kept' (relating to
Aorist še-i-nax-a = še-nax-ul i-kn-a and Perfect š n a x - u l - a ) or 'X

Perfect mo-nax-ul-a); alternatively, it may be used in the phrase av-i
tval-it ar i-nax-eb-a 2 5 7 'X is not seen with the evil eye', a colloquialism
meaning 'X is attractive' (the respective Aorist and Perfect are i-nax-a
and nax-ul-a). Notice the Medial Verb (Ø-Ø-)nax+ul-ob ((Ø-Ø-)inax+ul-eb) 'you (wIII) go somewhere to see X/them'. Note also (Ø-Ø-)ixil-av 2 5 8 'you will see/view X/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-xil-e, Perfect g-ixil-av-s), the Imperative of which is indicated by the abbreviation ix. for
(Ø-Ø-)i-xil-e(-t) Vid.' = Vide(te)'.
Active Participle for the basic verbs of seeing = m-xed-av-i/m-xedv - e l - i / m - x i l - v - e l - i / m - n a x - v - e l - i , Future Participle = sa-nax-avi/sa-xil-v-el-i, Privative Participle = u-nax-av-i/ar-nax-ul-i/u-xilav-i/u-xil-v-el-i, Past Participle = nax-ul-i/na-nax-i/xil-ul-i. From
äe-sa-xed-(av-)i 'worth looking at' the abstract-noun is š s a - x e d - a oba = s-e-xed-ul-oba/gare+gn+oba (e.g. mi+u+xed+av+ad mi+m+
zid+v+el-i še-sa-xed-a-ob-isa, nino mainc ver
(Ø-)e-gir+s-a
si+q'var+ul-s 'despite an alluring external appearance Nino was stIII not
able to become worthy of love').
For 'look at' there are also the Transitive Verbs (regular except that
they take no preverb): (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'ur-eb 259 (Aorist = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)uq'ur-e, Perfect g-i-q'ur-eb-i-a -tvis) = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cker(-i 2 6 Ø
)
(Aorist = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-ckir-e, Perfect g-i-cker-i-a -tvis) = (Ø-?ØØ-)u-mzer (Aorist = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-mzir-e, Perfect g-i-mzer-i-a -tvis)
'you (wIII) look at X/them'. used as formal intransitives in the Prešent SubSeries only (viz.
(Ø-)i-ckir-eb-i/(Ø-)i-q'ur-eb-i/(Ø-)i-mzir-eb-i)
each
of these three roots are then synonyms for (Ø-)i-xed-eb-i in the šense of
'look, gaze' (e.g. panjr-i+dan i-ckir-eb-a 'X is looking/gazing out of the
window'). The first two of these roots may be used transitively with a
variety of preverbs, but again only in the Prešent Sub-Series, in association
with an indirect object marked without versioniser to indicate the notion of
looking/gazing at some entity with the added nuance of directionality (e.g.
mta bar-s da-s-cker-od-a = da-h-q'ur-eb-d-a 'the mountain was
gazing down at the valley'; the preverb š
here conveys either the
expected nuance of 'into' or more surprisingly 'up at', since there is no verb
*a-(Ø-)s-cker-i, as in k'ak'1-is magal št'o-eb-s še-s-cker-i-an =
še-h-q'ur-eb-en 'they are gazing up at the high branches of the walnuttree'). KEGl also quotes the inceptive with indirect object (da-)(Ø-Ø-)acker-d-eb-i (Aorist = da-(Ø-Ø-)a-cker-d-i, Perfect = da-(Ø-)s-ckereb-i-xa+r 2 6 1 ) 'you (wIII) gaze intently upon X/them', whereas with the476GEORGIANGRAMMARpreverb še- it quotes only the Future š e - ( Ø - Ø - ) a - c k e r - d - e b - i
(reprešenting the Future Sub-Series) and Aorist še-(Ø-Ø-)a-cker-d-i
(reprešenting Series II) in the šense of 'you wIII/did start to look at X/them'
(e.g. š e - ( Ø - Ø - ) a - č e r - a
tval-eb-i
jera-m
k'ač'k'ač'-s
da
ga+oc+eb+ul-i še-(Ø-)a-cker-d-a 'the kite brought its eyes to rest on
the magpie and began in amazement to eye it').
Active Participle = m a - q ' u r - e b - e l - i / m a - c k e r - a l - I / m o - m z e r - a l - i
(all with syncopation in the penultimate syllable) 'viewer', Future = s a q , ur-eb-el-i/sa-cker-(el-)i/sa-mzer-el-i (with syncopating - e - in the
el-component).
Note some verbs found only in the Prešent Sub-Series which reprešent
the notion 'look' coupled with the extra lexical feature of the root, viz. še(Ø-Ø-)xar-i 'you look joyously upon X/them' (Imperfect in -od-), for the
root of which cf. (Ø-)u-xar-i-a 'X rejoices', s-e-(Ø-)h-popin-eb = š e (Ø-)s-t'rp-i (Imperfect in -od-, which is related to (Ø-Ø-)e-t'rp-i 'you
hold loving feeling towards X/them', also with Imperfect in -od-) 'you look
lovingly upon X/them'—another synonym is še-(Ø-)h-prpin-av, but this
Transitive Verb exists in all three Series. Of similar structure is š e (Ø-)h-per-i = še-(Ø-Ø-)även-i 'you suit/conform to X/them' (I mperfect
in -od-), whose synonyms are s-e-(Ø-Ø-)e-per-eb-i and, with a full
paradigm of screeves, š ( Ø - Ø - ) e - s a b a m - e b - i (Aorist še-(Ø-Ø-)esabam-e, Perfect
še-(Ø-Ø-)sabam-eb-i-x-a+r).
look Resplendent, Adorn
From - S v e n - we have in the Prešent Sub-Series only ( Ø - ) š v e n - i
(Imperfect in -od-), which as a monopersonal verb means 'look resplendent'
(e.g. erek'le cxen-ze šven-od-a 'Erek'le looked resplendent on the
horse'), but as a bipersonal verb it means for the form g-šven-i-s 'X
suits/is an adornment to you' (e.g. pšav=xevsur-s (Ø-)šven-i-s abjar-i
'chain-mail is an adornment to Pshav-Khevsurians'). A regular (and
cognate) verb for 'making beautiful; adorn' is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-mšven-eb
'you (wIII) beautify X/them' (e.g. ara+vitar-i sa+mk'+a+ul-i ar (Ø-)amšven-eb-d-a
otax-s 'no decoration was adorning the room').
(Ø-)šven-i-s may also serve as a synonym to še-(Ø-)e-per-eb-a/še-hper-i-s/še-(Ø-)šven-i-s.

In the Prešent Sub-Series it is possible to add a further indirect object
by making use of the Objective Version (e.g. šen ra (?Ø-)g-i-g+av-s
čem-s šv+il-s? 'what of you is like my son? = in what way do you
resemble my son?').
The dynamic verb 'grow to resemble' is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-m+s+g+av+seb-i = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-m+g+v+an-eb-i 'you (wIII) grow to resemble
X/them' (Aorist ( d a - ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e - m + s + g + av + s-e = ( d a - ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e m+g+v+an-e, Perfect (da-)(Ø-Ø-)m+s+g+av+s-eb-i-x-a+r = (da-)(ØØ-)m+g+v+an-eb-i-x-a+r).
Drink
Masdar = s-m-a (imperfective) vs da-1-ev-a (perfective)
The Prešent Sub-Series is built on (Ø-Ø-)sv-am 'you drink X/them',
which behaves like a normal verb in -am (Passive = i-s-m-eb-a 'X is
drinkable', n a - s v - a m - i = m-tvr-al-i 'drunk'). The perfective screeves
are usually built on da-(Ø-Ø-)l-ev 'you wIII drink X/them', which behaves
like a normal verb in -ev (e.g. Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)l-i-e, Perfect da-g-i-lev-i-a). The Causative is usually based on the perfective root (e.g.
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-I-ev-in-eb 'you (wIII) get X/them to drink Y/them'),
though (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev is possible (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sv-i, Perfect gi-s-m-ev-i-a -tvis). There is also an entirely regular verb (s'e-)(ØØ-)sv-am 'you (wIII) consume drink X' (cf. (še-)(Ø-Ø-)č'am 'you (wIII)
devour X/them'), though it is perhaps most common in the phrase vin-me-s478GEORGIANGRAMMARsa+dge+grj+el+o-s (še-)(Ø-Ø-)sv-am 'you (will) propose someone'sGEN
toast'.
Active Participle da-m-1-ev-i (m-s-m-el-i is rather used as the noun
'drinker'), Future Participle da-sa-1-ev-i/sa-s-m-el-i (the latter with its
syncopating -e- being often used nominally in the šense of 'drink'),
Privative Participle da-u-1-ev-el-i, Past Participle da-1-e-ul-i (cf. nasv-am-i used primarily of someone who is himself 'drunk', though it can be
used of the liquid imbibed and thus 'drunk' in the true participial šense).
Convey
Masdar = mo-q'van-a 'bringing (animate(s) 263 )' vs m o - t ' a n - a 'bringing
(inanimate(s))'—by changing the preverb the directionality of the
conveyance is altered according to the regular meaning of the preverbs
(e.g. š e - q ' v a n - a / š t ' a n - a 'taking in' vs äe-mo-q'van-a/s'e-mo-t'an-a
'bringing in').
In the Prešent Sub-Series the appropriate preverb is simply added to
the appropriate expression for 'X has Y' (e.g. (Ø-)m-q'+av-x-a+r 'I have
you' => mo-(Ø-)m-q'+av-x-a+r 'I am bringing you', v-(Ø-)q'+av-v-a+r-t
'X has/they have us' => a+m kuča-s ar mi-v-(Ø-)q'+av-v-a+r-t t'ajra-mde 'this street is not leading us to the church', g-k+on-d-a c'ign-i
'you had a book' => še-mo-g-k+on-d-a c'ign-i 'you were bringing in
a/the book')—for the verbs meaning 'have' see 4.7.4.
Outside the Prešent Sub-Series the verb-forms move from Indirect
Verbs to normal Transitives based on the roots -q'van-/-t'an-, which
behave like normal Root Verbs having Subjective Version in their
fundamental forms in the Future Sub-Series and in Series 11 (with Perfects
of the expected form mo-g-i-q'van-i-a/mo-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you have
brought animate(s)/inanimate(s)'). The Objective Version may substitute
where appropriate, making some forms ambiguous out of context (e.g.
momiq'vans may be analysed as m o - m - i - q ' v a n - s 'X will bring me
(hither)' in Subjective Version vs mo-(Ø-)m-i-q'van-s 'X will bring
animate X/them to me' in Objective Version). The animate-inanimate
distinction breaks down somewhat with the verb-forms da-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van
(e.g. sa+saxl+e-n-i da-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van-e-t ma-t sa+jirk'v+1-a-mde
'reduce the palaces to their foundations', sa+ert+o m+nis'vn+el-ze da(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van 'you will reduce X/them to a common denominator') and da(Ø-Ø-)i-t'an (e.g. kva kva-s (Ø-)e-c-a da me šua-ši da-m-i-t'ana
'stone crashed into stone and carried me down in the middle').
(a-/gada-)(Ø-Ø-)i-t'an means 'you (will) put up with/bear X/them'
(Perfect a-/gada-g-i-t'an-i-a).
The participles for the verbs indicating conveyance are of the type:VERBAl MORPHOlOGY479Active Participle = m o - m - t ' a n - i / m o - m - q ' v a n - i 'bringing', Future
Participle = mo-sa-t'an-i/mo-sa-q'van-i, Privative Participle = m o - u t ' a n - e l - i / m o - u - q ' v a n - e l - i 'not bringing' (with syncopating -el-), Past
Participle = mo-t'an-il-i/mo-q'van-il-i 'having been brought'.
Note the meaning of (da-)(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)a-t , an 'you (will) set X/them
somewhere' (e.g. a+k k'ar-eb-i da-v-(Ø-)a-t'an-o-t tu panjara?
'should we set/hang doors here or a window?) and in the šense of 'exert
(pressure)' we have examples like jala da-(Ø-Ø-)a-t'an-a tav+is tavsa da ra+m+den+i+me luk'ma ča-(Ø-lq'lap'-a 'X forced himself and
swallowed a few mouthfuls'). Note also that the Perfect now has the form
da-g-i-t'an-eb-i-a. This same form of the Perfect is seen in other verbforms of parallel structure in Series I such as (mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-t'an =>
Perfect m o - g - i - t ' a n - e b - i - a (e.g. k'ac-ma na+p'ir-s mo-(?Ø-Ø-)at'an-a 'the man drew close to the edge/shore', še+mo+dg+om+a-m m o ( ? Ø - ? Ø - ) a - t ' a n - a 'autumn approached') or (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'an =>
Perfect g a - g - i - t ' a n - e b - i - a (e.g. ar še-i-)l-eb-a e+s c'er+il-i vi-sme ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-t'an-o-t? 'isn't it possible for us to get someone to
take this letter?'). The Causatives of the verb-forms indicating conveyance
in some direction have the shape seen in (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'van-in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to bring animate(s)', (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'an-in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to take inanimate(s) out'.
The participles for verb-forms of the type (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'an are:
Active Participle = ga-m-t'an-eb-el-i, Future Participle = ga-sa-t'ane b - e l - i , Privative Participle = g a - u - t ' a n - e b - e l - i (all three with
syncopating -e-), Past Participle = ga-t'an-eb-ul-i.
The root -t'an- has an interesting bivalent Intransitive usage with a
number of preverbs to specify different directionality as exemplified by
(mi-XØ-Ø-)e-t'an-eb-i 'you (will) try to reach out to and catch hold of
X/them' (e.g. vin ar mi-(Ø-)s-t'an-eb-i-x-a+r-t otax-ši š m o - p r en-il čit'-s? 'who amongst you 264 has not tried to reach and catch a bird
that has flown into the room?').

Fall (down)
Masdar = da-varč+n-a (singular) vs da-cviv+n-a/da-cven-a (plural)
The two roots, distinguished according to the singularity vs plurality of
the subject, are used with a variety of preverbs depending on the direction
of the fall. I llustration is with da- indicating the simple notion of 'down'.
As monovalent Intransitives we have: Prešent vard-eb-a vs cviv-d-eb-a
or cviv-d-eb-i-an (if the plural subject imposes its plurality on the verb)
or possibly cviv-a(n), Future da-vard-eb-a vs d a - c v i v - d - e b - a / d a cviv-d-eb-i-an/da-cviv-a(n), Aorist da-vard-a vs da-cviv-d-a/dacviv-d-nen, Perfect da-varč+n-il-a vs da-cven-il-a(n)/da-cviv+n-482GEORGIANGRAMMARul-a(n) (the other screeves are formed from these as would be expected).
As bivalent I ntransitives 'fall down off/from X' we have: Prešent (Ø-)vardeb-a vs s - c v i v - d - e b - a / s - c v i v - d - e b - i - a n / s - c v i v - a ( n ) , Future da(Ø-)vard-eb-a vs d a - s - c v i v - d - e b - a / d a - s - c v i v - d - e b - i - a n / d a - s cviv-a(n), Aorist da-(Ø-)vard-a vs da-s-cviv-d-a/da-s-cviv-d-nen,
Perfect da-(Ø-)varč+n-i-a vs da-s-cven-i-a(n)/da-s-cviv+n-i-a(n).
The Past Participles are da-varč+n-l-i/da-cven-il-i/da-cviv+n-ul-i
'(having) fallen'.
Throw (down)
Masdar = da-gd-eb-a (singular) vs da-q'r-a (plural)
These are the Transitive roots corresponding to the Intransitive pair
just prešented for 'fall (down)', and the suppletion is now, of course,
determined by the entity thrown (i.e. the underlying direct object). A
number of preverbs are used with these roots, but the IIIustration takes
da- for the basic šense of 'throwing down'.
The first root is regular for a verb with Thematic Suffix -eb (e.g.
Prešent (Ø-Ø-)a-gd-eb, Future da-(Ø-Ø-)a-gd-eb, Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)agd-e, Perfect da-g-i-gd-i-a), whilst the latter is regular for a verb with
Thematic Suffix -i (e.g. Prešent (Ø-Ø-)q'r-i, Future da-(Ø-Ø-)q'r-i,
Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)q'ar-e, Perfect da-g-i-q'r-i-a).
Note the expressions: q'ur-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-gd-eb = q'ur-s (Ø-ØØ-)a-txov-eb 'you (will) pay attention to X/them'; tav-s (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)iq'r-i-t 'you(Pl) (will) gather together' vs k'vercx-eb-s tav-s (mo-)(ØØ-Ø-)u-q'r-i 'you (will) gather the eggs together'; xel-t/xel-ši (ča-)(ØØ-)i-gd-eb 'you (will) get your hands on X/them = take X/them into your
clutches', where the preverb is optional even in the perfective screeves
and where the root does not change even for a plural object.

Masdar = še-xved+r-a/še-xvd-om-a. For meeting by appointment (e.g.
at a railway-/bus-station) the preverb is changed to da- (with this preverb
the indirect object in Series I and 11 may be indicated by means of the
Objective Version); if the preverb is mo-, the meaning is 'hitting (target)'.
Prešent = (Ø-Ø-)xvd-eb-i 'you meet X/them', Future = š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v d eb-i, Aorist = š e - ( Ø - Ø - ) x v d - i , Perfect = š e - ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e d + r - i - x a + r / š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v d - o m - i - x - a + r . Examples: gza-ši mo+nadir+e-eb-i
še-(Ø-)xvd-nen
lom-s 'the hunters met a lion on the road', sada+c
xsn+a-s (Ø-)e-l-od-nen, met'-i gan+sa+cd+el-i še-(Ø-)xvd-a-t
'where they were awaiting salvation, they met with greater torment =
greater torment befell them', in which latter clause the verb could beVERBAl MORPHOlOGY483interchanged with še-(Ø-)e-mtxv-a-t/mo-(Ø-)u-xd-a-t/gada-(Ø-)xda-t/tav-s = tav-ze da-(Ø-)a-t , q , d-a-t. Note that in the expression
c'il-ad g-xvd-eb-a 'X falls to your lot' no preverb is used in any
screeve. In addition to meaning 'hit (target)' (e.g. t'q'via pex-ši mo(Ø-)xvd-a datv-s 'the bullet hit the bear in the foot'), the Aorist with 2nd
person subject is used as the equivalent to 'wrong number!' (viz. ar mo-(Ø?Ø-)xvd-i(-t)) when answering the phone.
The participles are of the form: Active = š m - x v e d + r - i / š e - m - x v d om-i/še-m-xvd-ur-i, Future = š s a - x v e d + r - i , Past = še-xved+r-ili/šm-xvd-ar-i.
The Causative is of the form (š)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xved+r-eb 'you (will)
give X/them the opportunity to meet Y/them' (e.g. ra-m mo-m-i-q'van-a
a+m šen(-s) saxl-ši da še-m-(Ø-)a-xved+r-a šen(-s) tav-sa? 'what
brought me into this house of yours and gave me the opportunity to meet
you?266'). Non-finite forms are as one would expect of a verb in -eb.
The verb for 'realise' is odd insofar as it patterns in Series I and II just
like 'meet' with Nominative subject and Dative object, and yet in Series III,
even though the Dative nominal is retained, the verb is monopersonal in
form (viz. a+m xel+na+c'er-is pas-s ver (Ø-?Ø-)xvd-eb-i/mi-(Ø?Ø-)xvd-eb-i/mi-(Ø-?Ø-)xvd-i/mi-(Ø-)m-xvd-ar-x-a+r 'you can't/
won't be able to/couldn't/haven't been able to realise the price of this
manuscript'); only if a further Dative nominal, marked in Series I and II by
the Objective Version, is added, does the III rd Series become formally
bipersonal (viz. g l - i s c'ad+il-s ver (Ø-?Ø-)m-i-xvd-eb-i/mi-(Ø?Ø-)m-i-xvd-eb-i/mi-(Ø-?Ø-)m-i-xvd-i/mi-(Ø-?Ø-)m-xvd-om-i-xa+r 'you are/will be/were/have been unable to realise my heart's desire').
The non-finite forms are: Masdar mi-xvedr-a/mi-xvd-om-a, Active
Participle m i - m - x v e d r - i / m i - m - x v d - o m - i / m i - m - x v d - u r - i , Future
Participle mi-sa-xvedr-i/mi-sa-xvd-om-i, Privative Participle m i - u x v e d r - e l - i / m i - u - x v d - o m - e l - i (the latter with syncopating suffixal
vowel), Past Participle mi-xvedr-il-i/mi-m-xvd-ar-i.
Be in front of/come before
The expression is as in: ianvar-i c'in (Ø-)u-)gv-i-s teberval-s
'January comes before February' (cf. teberval-i uk'an mo-s-d-ev-s
ianvar-s 'February follows after January'). The same expression may also
mean 'lead and shew the way to' (e.g. q'oran-i mgel-s c'in (Ø-)u-)g-oda 'the raven was leading and shewing the way to the wolf), from which it is
a small step to meaning 'be the leader of' (e.g. sa+zog+ad+o+eba-s c'in
(Ø-)u-)gv-i-s me+cn+ier-i 'a scholar/scientist is the leader of the
society'). The verb is also used as an Indirect Verb in the šense of 'having484GEORGIANGRAMMARX to one's name' (e.g. did-i gvac'+l-i g-i-)gv-i-s sa+m+š+ob+l+o-s
c'in 'you have great service to your name before your homeland'). For
each of these šenses the verb may optionally take the preverb m i - (e.g.
k'rux-i q'ovel+tvis c'in mi-(Ø-)u-)gv-i-s c'ic'il-eb-s 'the hen always
leads the way for the chicks', ra bral-i mi-g-i-)gv-i-t kal-is
si+k'vd+il-ši? 'what fault lies with you(Pl) in the death of the woman?').
As dynamic bivalent Intransitive equivalents we have (Ø-Ø-)u-)gv-ebi/ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-)gv-eb-i/ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-)ex-i 267
/ga-(Ø-)s-)g-ol-i-x-a+r
'you are/will be/were/have been leader/supervisor of X/them' or (Ø-Ø-)ujgv-eb-i/mi-(Ø-Ø-)u-)gv-eb-i/mi-(Ø-Ø-)u-)ex-i/ml-(Ø-)s-)g-ol-ix-a+r 'you, leading, guide/will guide/guided/have guided X/them thither'.
Non-finite forms are of the pattern: Masdar ga-)g-ol-a, Active Participle
ga-m-)g-ol-i (cf. m-)g-ol-i 'driver'), Future Participle ga-sa-)g-ol-i,
Past Participle ga-)g-ol-il-i (N.B. c'a-na-m+jgv+ar-i = c'ina-p'ir-oba
'pre-condition', which seems to be a doubly marked Past Participle in both
na- and circumfix m- -ar from the Future c'a-(Ø-Ø-)u-)gv-eb-i 'you
will lead X/them forward, will direct (the course of) X/them' = c'ar(Ø-Ø-)mart-av = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-xel+m+jgv+an+el-eb, which in turn
comes from xel+m+jgv+an+el-i 'supervisor, overseer' and must originally
have meant something like 'guiding the hand xel-i' with Active Participle in
m- -el from a no longer extant Transitive form of this root).
Do not confuse the above-forms in mi- with the normal Transitive Verb
in -i, namely (mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)gvn-i 'you (will) dedicate X/them to
Y/them' (for the root cf. jgven-i 'gift'268 ).
Make for/as if to attack X, go for/lay into X, have it in for X; be strong
enough for X
The verb in question exists only in the Prešent Sub-Series and is (Ø-Ø-)er č - i (Imperfect in -od-) (e.g. gul-i tu ar (Ø-)e-rč-i-s k'ac-s, pex-it
sul ver (?Ø-)i-vl-i-s-o 'if a man's heart is not strong, he won't be able
to move on foot, they say'). II is common in the question: ra-s (Ø-?Ø-)me-rč-i = (Ø-?Ø-)m-e-martl-eb-i 'why are you laying into me/do you
have it in for me?'.
Wait for
Masdar = lod+in-i. In the Prešent we have (Ø-Ø-)e-l-i 'you are waiting
for X/them', which may also be expressed by (Ø-Ø-)e-l+od+in-eb-i and
(Ø-Ø-)e-l+od-eb-i;
the first two verbs exist only in the Prešent SubSeries, with Imperfects in -od-, whilst the third may be used without
alteration as a Future Indicative and also has Series II forms, such as the
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-l+od-e. If we make use of the preverb da- to give theVERBAl MORPHOlOGY485Future da-(Ø-Ø-)e-l+od-eb-i 'you will wait for X/them', the verb-form
now has a full paradigm of screeves (Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)e-l+od-e, Perfect
da-(Ø-Ø-)l+od-eb-i-x-a+r). mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-l-i 'you are expecting
X/them' exists only in the Prešent Sub-Series (cf. mo-1 + od + i n - i
'expectation', mo-sa-1+od+n-el-i 'to be expected', mo-u-1+od+n-el-i
'unexpected').

There are two patterns of formation—the prescribed vs the proscribedbut-encountered. The prescriptively approved pattern does not employ the
Perfect marker -i but adds the agreement-suffixes directly to the Thematic
Suffix, a 3rd person direct object being co-indexed by means of - s .
Examples:
hide

mo-(Ø-)u-xn-av-t264GEORGIANGRAMMARN.B. out of context such forms as the above are ambiguous between
Perfect vs Objective Version of the Future Indicative, so that damimalavs
in addition to meaning 'I have hidden X/them' (= da-m-i-mal-av-s) could
be interpreted as da-(Ø-)m-i-mal-av-s 'X will hide Y/them for me'.
With variable arguments we have: da-m-i-mal-av-x-a+r-t 'I have
hidden you(Pl.)\ da-(Ø-)gv-i-mal-av-x-a+r 'we have hidden you', da-(ØØ-)u-mal-av-x-a+r 'X has/they have hidden you', mo-v-(Ø-)u-k'l-avv 4 8 -a+r-t (= da-v-(Ø-)u-xoc-av-v-a+r-t) 'X has/they have killed us',
mo-g-i-k'l-av-v-a+r-t 'you have killed us' vs 'you(Pl) have killed me/us',
where when the direct object is 1st person plural we could have da-g-ixoc-av-v-a+r-t.
The alternative pattern of formation results from the influence of the
regular Perfect patterning we have already seen with other types of verb,
such that the Thematic Suffix is replaced by the Perfect marker -i, though
when the object is 1st or 2nd person, the Thematic Suffix may be retained
in its reduced form of -v (which for vowelless roots ending in a sonant will
stand within the root itself). Examples:
hide
da-m-i-maH-a
da-g-i-mal-i-a

killed you(Pl)'.
Thematic Suffix -i
There is no way of telling whether, since both are -I, it is the Thematic
Suffix or the Perfect marker which actually appears in the Perfect. The
root retains the same shape it possessed in Series I:

Thematic Suffix -ob
The Thematic Suffix is dropped, the Perfect marker -i attaching to the
root, which, since now followed by a vowel other than -o, will, where it
exists, shew its -v standing in the same position it adopts in the Aorist
Indicative—none of the other root-extensions we saw in the Aorist appear
in the Perfect. Examples are of the roots -xrč(v)-, - g m - , -t(v)r-,

If we take the forms (ča-)(Ø-Ø-)l-cv-am 'you (will) don X/them' and,
with locative Version, (ča-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-cv-am 'you (will) put article(s) of
clothing on X/them', we might expect the two to fall together in the Perfect
as š a - g - i - c v - a m - s . However, this Perfect correlates only with the
Subjective Versional forms of Series I and II (i.e. the former of the forms
above); putting clothing on some third party requires the Perfect ča-g-ic-m-ev-i-a (ra+me vin+me-s-tvis) 'you have dressed (someone in
something)', which is the Perfect that strictly belongs to the older PrešentFuture (ča-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c-m-ev.
Thematic Suffix -op
The Perfect marker -i attaches directly to the root for 'divide', which has
the form -q'v-:

TheGEORGIANdesignation 'Second Evidential/Apparential/Inferential'
implies that the screeve basically conveys the same nuance of 'apparently'
discussed above for the Perfect, but such a nuance is even less clearlyVERBAl MORPHOlOGY267detectable here than with the Perfect, such that it is best to think of the
Pluperfect as being the simple translation-equivalent of English 'X had
VERBed', e.g.
(turme)
kututo
ra+ga+c
sn+e+ul+eba-s
(apparently) eyelid(NOM) some
diseašDAT
a-mo-(Ø-)e-č'am-a
PREV-PREV-(it-)I OV-eat-it(PlUP)
'(apparently) some disease had eaten away the eyelid'
The screeve is found in past clauses of purpose: it is often stated that
this reprešents an innovation in place of the older use of the III rd
Subjunctive, as found in the Rach'an dialect, but I have argued (1987.34)
that the use of an indicative form is original, for it was earlier employed in
conjunction with the non-factual particle -mca, and that Rach'an has
innovated in this regard. It is also found in past unreal conditions, where
indeed it may appear without the conditional conjunction rom, e.g.
me
mo-g-e-k'al-i,
k'arg-i
i-q'+o,
me(NOM) PREV-you-IOV-kill-PlUP(lst.PER) good-NOM SV-was

ojax-i
family-NOM
'had you killed me, it was (?would have been) fine, before you had 5Ø
brought down and ruined the family'
The screeve's conditional role is close to its function in expressing a
past wish, with or without the reinforcing particle net'a(v(i)), e.g.
netavi
tkven-tan
would.that you(Pl.)-tou+pr+o adre i+s
mo-m-e-q'van-a
more
early X(NOM) PREV-I-IOV-bringX(PlUP)
'would that I had brought X to you earlier'
The Pluperfect is also found with modal particles relating to the past,e.g.
dro-ze u+nd+a
time-on shouldga-g-e-k'et-eb-in-a

Apart from verbs in -eb that have a vowel in the root, the Nominative
direct object is indicated in the verb in exactly the same way as the
subject is indicated in the equivalent Aorist Indicative, which means that
the Weak or Strong endings along with any root-extension found in the
Aorist, whether throughout the paradigm or just when the subject is 1st or
2nd person, will be repeated in the Pluperfect with the difference that it is
now the direct object which motivates them.
Thematic Suffix -eb
let us illustrate first the paradigm for verbs with no radical vowel:
praise
(še-)m-e-k-o
(š)g-e-k-o

ga-g-e-šv-a
ga-(Ø-)e-šv-a
ga-gv-e-šv-a
ga-g-e-šv-a-t
ga-(Ø-)e-šv-a-tWith variable arguments: ( š ) ( Ø - ) m - e - k - e - t 'I had praised you(Pl)',
( š ) v - ( Ø - ) e - k - e 'X/they had praised me', (še-)(Ø-)gv-e-k-e 'we had
praised you', ga-g-e-šv-i 'you had released me', ga-(Ø-)m-e-šv-i-t 'I
had released you(Pl)', ga-g-e-šv-i-t 'you(Pl) had released me/us' vs 'you
had released us', ga-v-(Ø-)e-šv-i-t 'X/they had released us'.
In the case of verbs of this sub-type with a vowel in the root the Weak
Aorist Indicative endings follow not merely the Thematic Suffix but the
additional element -in-, which in origin is surely the Causative suffix used
here to underline the verb-form's transitivity, e.g.

da-g-e-bad-eb-in-a-t
da-(Ø-)e-bad-eb-in-a-tThe second verb here shews the following patterns with variable
arguments: da-(Ø-)m-e-bad-eb-in-e 'I had given birth to you', da-g-ebad-eb-in-e 'you had given birth to me', da-v-(Ø-)e-bad-eb-in-e-t
'X/they had given birth to us'.
As in the Perfect we must note the following oppositions: (da-)(ØØ-)a-jin-eb 'you (will) put X/them to sleep' has the Pluperfect da-g-ejin-eb-in-a, whilst (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)i-jin-eb 'you (will) go to sleep' has the
Pluperfect da-g-e-jin-a; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-gvij-eb 'you (will) wake X/them
up' has the Pluperfect ga-g-e-gvij-eb-in-a, whilst (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-)i-gvijeb 'you (will) wake up' has the Pluperfect ga-g-e-gvij-a. Also (da-)(ØØ-)a-sven-eb 'you (will) get X/them to rest' has the Pluperfect da-g-esven-eb-in-a, whereas (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)i-sven-eb 'you (will) rest' has the
Pluperfect da-g-e-sven-a.
In West Georgia particularly one may find these Pluperfects dropping
the nasal element of the suffix -in-, producing such forms as da-m-ebad-eb-i-a '1 had given birth to X/them', da-g-e-bad-eb-i-e 'you had
given birth to me', da-(Ø-)gv-e-bad-eb-i-e-t 'we had given birth to
you(Pl.)'. In effect, what this means is that the dialects concerned have an
element - i - as IIIrd Series morph, the Perfect being indicated by means of
Objective Version plus what is esšentially the Prešent Indicative of the
copula as endings correlating with the direct object vs the Pluperfect with
the Indirect Object Version plus the Aorist Indicative endings correlating
with the direct object51.

ga-g-e-q'-o-t
ga-(Ø-)e-q'-o-t4.7.1.3.3.3. lllrd Subjunctive (me+sam+e k'avšir+eb+it-i)
In the succinct formulation of Asmat P'ap'idze (1979) this screeve 'portrays
a potential, hypothetical action or the denial of such in the past as well as
a wish for the future'. Its function as an optative seems especially common
on formal occasions, such as toasting. It is found with the conjunction273VERBAl MORPHOlOGYt+i+tk+o(+s) 'as if' and in generic relative clauses with reference to the
past, as well as in expressions of the type 'I don't recall (X) VERBing'.
Just as the Pluperfect is based on the Aorist Indicative incorporating
as its mechanism for agreeing with the direct object the patterns
associated in the corresponding Aorist Indicative with sub/ecf-agreement,
so the same parallelism is seen between agreement with the direct object in
the I l l r d Subjunctive and agreement with the subject in the corresponding
Aorist Subjunctive—the same vowels (viz. -o vs -a) will be used along with
any changes to the root that characterise the Aorist Subjunctive. The only
additional point that needs to be made is that roots with Thematic Suffix
-eb which contain a vowel in the root shew the same suffixal sequence
- e b - i n - in the III rd Subjunctive that they shew in their Pluperfect;
although this sequence is abšent in the corresponding forms of Series II,
these verbs build their III rd Subjunctive by means of the same o-vowel
that they use in their Aorist Subjunctive with the difference that it is
suffixed to -eb-in-.

'may X/they release us', ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-šv-a-t 'may X/they release you(Pl)'

ambiguities will be found wherever (i) the 3rd person singular Aorist
Indicative ends in -o and the Aorist/IIIrd Subjunctive is in -o, (ii) the 3rd
person singular Aorist Indicative ends in -a and the Aorist/IIIrd
Subjunctive is in -a.
As in the Perfect and Pluperfect we must note the following oppositions:
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-jin-eb 'you (will) put X/them to sleep' has the III rd
Subjunctive da-g-e-jin-eb-in-o-s, whilst (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)i-jin-eb 'you

There are three main ways of forming Intransitives for the screeves of
Series I and II—in Series III single pattern is followed (or rather there
is one uniform pattern for monopersonal Intransitives and a distinct but
uniform pattern for bipersonal Intransitives). The formations are known in
GEORGIANas (i) prefixai passives (p'repiks+ul-i vn+eb+it-i), (ii) dpassives (don+ian-i vn+eb+it-i), and (iii) markerless passives (u+nišn+o
vn+eb+it-i). Type i, the most widespread type, places the vowel i-, which
in origin was presumably the Subjective Version vowel, immediately before
the verbal root; type ii places the consonant -d (called inGEORGIANdon-i)VERBAl MORPHOlOGY277immediately after the root; type iii has no particular distinguishing feature.
When an indirect object is associated with an Intransitive Verb in screeves
of Series I and II, the noun stands in the Dative case and either the
version-system is employed or the agreement-prefix is placed immediately
before the root, depending on the verb in question: type i forms simply
change their i-prefix to the Indirect Object Versioniser e-, whereas the
other two types, unless the agreement-prefix stands immediately before the
root, will use either the Objective or locative Versioniser, as appropriate
according to the šense. Types ii and iii always employ the Thematic Suffix
-eb (placed immediately after the d-suffix of type ii) in Series I screeves,
whilst type i use a selection of Thematic Suffixes, depending on the sub­
class of the verb concerned.
AlthoughGEORGIANphilology styles all verbs belonging to the class we
are about to describe as being of 'passive voice' (vn+eb+it-i gvar-i), by
no means all the relevant verbs are true passives, which is why we have
designated them as 'Intransitive'—for example, (ga-)i-g-eb-a, the
Intransitive equivalent of the Transitive (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-g-eb 'you (will)
open X/them', does not mean 'it is being (will be) opened'; rather it is either
a simple intransitive 'X is opening (will open)' or a potential with the šense
'X may be opened/is openable'. If we add an indirect object to this
monovalent form, this indirect object will, semantically speaking, be either
a possessive or benefactive (cf. k'ošk'-s ga-(Ø-)e-g-eb-a k'ar-i 'the
door of the tower will open' vs ga-m-e-g-o samotx-is k'ar-i 'the door
of heaven opened unto me = I achieved happiness'). However, with some
verbs, where the potential šense is to the fore, the indirect object will
reprešent the entity who is or, more likely, is not able to carry out the
relevant verbal action (cf. e+s p'ur-i i-č'm-eb-a 'this bread is edible' vs
šen-i
p'ur-i
adam+ian-s ar
your-AGR bread-NOM person-DAT not
'a human being cannot eat your bread'52)(Ø-)e-č'm-eb-a
(him-)IOV-eat-TS-itHowever, it is type i Intransitives which are most likely to carry true
passive force, and in the case of the verb 'bake', which has both a prefixai
and a markerless formation, the former (i-cx-ob-a) has passive meaning
'X is being baked', whilst the latter (cxv-eb-a) is just intransitive 'X (e.g.
the bread) is baking'. Intransitives formed by means of the suffixal
mechanism often have the force of an inceptive (viz. 'begin.../become...').
A syntactic peculiarity of some formally monopersonal Intransitives is
that they are construed with a second argument that looks suspiciously like
a direct object, thus rendering them bivalent, but, because such verbs are278GEORGI AN GRAMMARonly used in the Prešent Sub-Series, it is impossible to tell. Examples
include: (active voice) Transitive (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-jl-ev kal-s rč+ev+a-s 'you
give advice to the woman' (for this verb see 4.1) vs (formally passive voice)
Intransitive (Ø-?Ø-)i-jl-ev-i rč+ev+a-s 'you give (out) advice'53; (active
voice) Transitive ra ambav-s (Ø-)g-c'er-en? 'what news are they
writing to you?' vs (formally passive voice) Intransitive g a z e t - e b - i
i+s+e+t ambav-s (?Ø-)i-c'er-eb-a, rom gada-(Ø-)i-r-ev-i 'the
papers write such news that you'll go bananas'; (active voice) Transitive
ga+marjv+eb-is ambav-s (Ø-)m-a-t'q'-ob-in-eb-d-nen 'they were
informing me of the news of the victory' vs (formally passive voice)
Intransitive ga+marjv+eb-is ambav-s (?Ø-)i-t'q'-ob-in-eb-od-nen
'they were reporting the news of victory'. There are other (formally
passive) Intransitives which, however, have no active voice Transitive
counterparts, which exist in all Series, and which are similarly construed
with either one or possibly two Dative nominals across the Series. Here
they are prescriptively treated as Intransitives across their paradigms,
such that even in Series II they have Nominative subject combined with
one or two Dative nominals (e.g. deda zgap'ar-s mo-h-q'v-a 'mother
narrated a fairy-tale' vs deda zgap'ar-s bavšv-s mo-(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'v-a
'mother narrated a fairy-tale to the child'), though in speech one does hear
the construction with these verbs 'regularised' according to Transitive
norms, with Ergative subject and Nominative direct object (viz. deda-m
zgap'ar-i mo-h-q'v-a 'mother narrated a fairy-tale' vs d e d a - m
zgap'ar-i bavšv-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-qV-a 'mother narrated a fairy-tale to
the child').

4.7.2.1.1.1 Prešent Indicative
No matter which type of formation is found, whichever Thematic Suffix is
prešent will be followed by the vowel -i in all persons except when it is
replaced by the 3rd person singular subject allomorph -a; a 3rd person
plural subject selects the allomorph -an.
Thematic Suffix -eb
Roots of this sub-class which have a vowel in the root and mark their
Neutral Version in the active voice by means of a- use the suffixal
strategy.
The same - v - that was added in the active voice
(mo+km+e+d+eb+it-i gvar-i) forms to roots ending in -a and -o is also
found here, as indeed it is found if a root ends in -u as well; final -e on a279VERBAl MORPHOlOGYnominal root is dropped. If syncopation occurs in a nominal root, it will
occur here too. The illustrated verbs are: (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-k'et-eb 'you
(will) make X/them better', (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-brma-v-eb 'you (will) blind
X/them', (ga-XØ-Ø-)a-parto-v-eb 'you (will) broaden X/them', (ga-)(ØØ-)a-q'ru-eb 'you (will) deafen X/them', (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-me+p-eb 'you

X/them' (e.g. ekim-s ra+t'om (Ø-Ø-)e-čven-eb-i? 'why are you
shewing yourself to the doctor = getting him to examine you?'). Also from
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-xerx-eb 'you (will) manage (to do) X' we get the suffixal
passive (mo-)xerx-d-eb-a 'X is/will be managed' seen in:
