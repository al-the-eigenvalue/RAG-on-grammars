"These interrogative pronominals functions in content questions, and the pronouns referring
to A , S a nd P, appear in a special structural position, which is described in §6. 1 .
Interrogatives of possession ('whose?') are formed in a normal possessive construction with
the interrogative amo:
(83) a. A amo bIe?
pig who that
'Whose pig is that?'
b. A dina .
pig I SG.POSS
'(It's) my pig. 'Pronominal forms53An alternative reply to this question i s t o simply use the possessive pronoun, or a noun i n a
possessive function, as a predicate: Dina 'Mine'.
Questioning locations is a fraught issue in I'saka. The examples above have shown
questions based around the position of an inanimate item ('Where is your house?'), or the
direction of travel ('Where are you going?'). It is not so easy to ask where a person is. A
typical question/answer sequence is one in (84):
(84) a. Mama amo bu ?
who woman
2SG
'Where are you from?'
b. Nana J 'saka bu.
1 SG Krisa woman
'I 'm a Krisa woman.'
I t is easy to see that the question is literally asking 'Whose woman are you?' This
question, and the answer, shows the personification that is normal in I'saka when referring to
villages: 'I am Krisa's woman ' . An alternative way of questioning someone's origins,
something like 'You are a woman of where?', is not grammaticaL
(84)' c. * mama

questioning situation arises when questioning someone's clan name. In this case the literal
translation of the sentence is 'Your clan's name is who?', as can be seen in (85).

"3.5. 4 EpistememesThe various morphemes used to form questions also form a tacit classification of the
world, acording to which epistememe is appropriate to question which nominal. The different
epistememes, along with examples of their use, are presented in §4.2.",[61]
"Deviations from the word order presented here are rare, although preverbal constituents
are occasionally found either at the end of the clause for emphasis, or in the pragmatically
marked preverbal 'focus' position in which elements are pragmatically salient, and, with the
exception of nominals or pronouns that simply double a clause-external topic, do appear to be
necessarily focused. This is most commonly found if that constituent is the answer to a
content question. Furthermore, there is a pre-sentential topic position, which is filled with
any NP (subject, object, or an oblique) from the clause. The topic NP in the main clause can
optionally be doubled in the clause, in the preverbal focus position (unless the clause contains
another argument with the pragmatic function 'focus').
(24 1 )S'�NPTO P S(lNP)Note that an NP in the topic position retains its normal case-marking possibilities, as seen
in the following examples:

"4Pronominal formsI 'saka has a rich range of pronominal forms, both free and bound. There are seven
pronoun sets in I'saka, comprising four types of independent personal pronouns, and three
sets of bound pronouns. In this section the forms of the different pronouns will be discussed,
with notes on their different functions, which will be explicated in more detail in §5.2.
4.1 Personal pronounsThe personal pronouns in I'saka distinguish first, second, third, and indeterminate (i.e.
question) person, and maximally three numbers. Additionally, gender and case are found as
separate categories, according to the following criteria:
Number: Singular and Plural are distinguished on all pronouns, and Dual is a
distinct number on first and second person pronouns;
Gender:Gender (masculine or non-masculine) is marked on third singular
pronouns only; it is a category only for the singular pronouns, with no
distinction between masculine and non-masculine in the plural;Case:Amongst the singular pronouns, all but the question pronouns can be
marked for nominative or accusative case, or appear in an unmarked
form.","[62, 63]"
An A-P-V order is not possible when the subject is a question-word pronoun:88Chapter 6(250)*amo tra ble bei?,"[105, 106]"
"6. 1.2 Interrogative clauses and the word order offocusThe word order of interrogative clauses differs from that of declarative clauses. In an
interrogative clause an interrogative pronoun (illustrated here with amo 'who') will appear in
the preverbal focus position. This is true even if the referent of the question word is the
subject of the clause, and mirrors the ordering of constituents under focus in questions,
mentioned above.
(249)amo b-ei?
Tra
bie
who QSG-do
sago.delight.NM that
[ OBJ ]
[SUBJ] [VERB]
'Who made that sago delight?'",[105]
"This suggests that there is a structural position for pragmatically prominent core elements
of the clause, which is immediately preverbal, a phenomenon not uncommon in SOV
languages. Note that a questioned oblique still occurs in the normal postverbal position:
(25 1 )Sit
b-akale kaung-ri?
sago 2SG-wrap what-INSTR
'What will you wrap the sago with?'",[106]
"The question that might be raised is whether these represent cognate forms, or borrowed
forms, in the different languages. A superficial glance does not reveal many striking
cognates across the languages (barring this initial phone), and there are no morphological
similarities past this apparently classing phenomena. It seems that the idea of a 'shared
library' of biological terms in the Pual basin, proposed by Kocher Schmid ( 1 999) (see
§2 6 1 ), makes a lot of sense. The idea is that the culturally distinct groups in the Pual basin
area, where the people of Krisa trace their origins even though they now live above that basin
on the Oenake plateau, have a common stock of labels for plants and animals, regardless of
their linguistic affiliation. These classing phenomena might be evidence for the antiquity of
that library, with the classes being retained in fossilised form even though the terms for the
individual species are often not cognate.
.",[58]
"4. 1.3 Accusative pronounsThe accusative pronouns are restricted to representing only referents which serve as the
object of a bivalent verb. The following sentences show examples of the use of the
accusative in a bivalent clause, and of its ungrammaticality when used to mark an oblique
(similarly, the accusative set may not be used to represent subjects, though this is not
illustrated here).

rain.M 2SG.ACC 3SG.M-wet
'The rain wets you. 'The non-plural possessive pronouns clearly show a relationship (presumed to be historical)
to their corresponding dative suffix (see Table 28), and to the accusative pronouns. For
instance, we could analyse the l SG.POSS pronoun as being the accusative form of the pronoun
combined with the dative suffix:
This, of course, begs the question of identify ing a subject; the referent of an involuntary state predicate,
which is index ed on the verb with dative suffix es, may also appear in nominative case. See §5.2.4, §6.2 .",[66]
"Syntax
(244)'87*kie, amo kie rna ?(244)' is ungrammatical because the question word amo already appears in the preverbal
focus position, and so it is impossible for the topic to be doubled there. The examples below
show that even an oblique, if it is doubled, appears in the preverbal focus position, not in the
expected postverbal oblique position. Note that an instrument, which is normally marked not
just by postverbal position but also by the case marker -ri, when topic ali sed requires that a
pronoun remain behind in the original position to carry the case marking.

"Syntax89In monovalent clauses, a subject-linked adjective occupies the peripheral (i.e. non­
subcategorised) postverbal slot, functioning as a secondary predicate (25 5):
(255)D-elel asongpa nil.
l SG-go stealth(y) INTENSE
'I go along, very stealthily. 'In realis bivalent clauses a subject-linked adjective i s placed i n the noun phrase with the
subject, and the object-linked adjective fills the postverbal position, as seen earlier in (254).
We can thus conclude that the ability of an adjective to appear in a postverbal position is
dependent on the nominal that it refers to being the S or the P of the clause, that is, an
absolutive argument. This can be shown to be the case by examining the following clauses,
using the quantifier purupa 'all, complete' in a postverbal position. The first sentence has a
singular subject, so the interpretation of the quantifier as modifying the P is not surprising. In
the second clause, daka u is the only argument of the monovalent clause, and so the
interpretation is not in question.

"A literal glossing of this sentence is impossible. The accusative pronoun, in preverbal
position, signals that 'I ' should be glossed as 'me': '(it) sickens me'. Despite this, the dative
suffixes following the verb imply that we are dealing with a possessor or beneficiary: '(it)
sickens forlon me'. We are thus in a dilemma about the grammatical function associated
with the first person singular participant in (267): the dative suffixes imply that it is an
oblique, and the accusative case implies that it is object.
Other involuntary state sentences do not use dative suffixing:92Chapter 6(268)Pi

appear in a nominative case (or, as is true of almost all constructions, the unmarked case,
which for example (269) would mean coding the l sG pronoun as nana). This is found only
if the argument in question appears before a causing event, and if an experiencer argument is
called for by the construction. A nominative experience is illustrated in the following
example, where the predicate ('sick') subcategorises for an experiencer, causing the sickness
to be manifested in that experiencer.

"5.2.2 Subject inflectionAll verbs (both finite and non-finite) in I'saka inflect by prefix for subject, as can be seen
by the following mainly regular paradigms of the verbs -iy 'sleep' and -oung 'eat'. The
columns for each verb are, left to right, singular, dual and plural, with first, second, and third
person rows running down each column. The final row is the 3SG.NM form, distinguished
from the 3SG.M only in the singular.

(2)-oungBased on this data, and other verbal paradigms, we can infer the underlying prefixes that
are applied to the verbs. The abstracted forms of the prefixes are shown in Table 25 below,
in the same arrangement as the forms in ( 1 0 1 ). We can see that the prefixes encode person,
number, and (for third person singular) gender. Singular, dual and plural number are
distinguished, and in the third person singular form a distinction between masculine and non­
masculine gender of subject is marked. Third person singular non-masculine forms are
commonly irregular and suppletive, and this is also the case (to a lesser degree) with third
person plural subjects. Prefixes for indeterminate subjects - that is, the agreement found on
verbs for questioned subjects, as in 'Who's coming?' - are identical to those used for second
persons, of whatever number is appropriate (unmarkedly singular).

vowel of the verb root. If the first vowel of the verb root is nasal, prefixal oral voiced stops
are realised as nasal stops. Thus the 2SG prefix, for example, shows root-governed
alternation between [b-] and [m-].
Subject-inflected examples of the verbs -ele 'go' and -bung 'eat' are shown below. I n the
first case there is no exceptional allomorphy involved, whereas in the second we can see the
nasal allophone of /d/ appearing as a result of the nasalisation on the first (and only) syllable
of the verb root. When the verb root does not start with a nasalised vowel, the prefix does
not take the nasal allomorph:

both elements of the NP:
(88)'*kasue dei pai ri bima, *kasue dei pai ri bima ri(89)'*su nou yung kung ri kaipa, *su nou yung kung ri kaipa riThe instrumental noun phrase is an oblique, as judged by the position of the NP after the
verb, and the lack of any agreement with it on the verb. Instrumentally inflected nouns can
also serve as modifiers for nouns inside the NP, as in the following phrase:
(90)pili
ape-ri
garden white.man-INSTR
'non-traditional garden 'I n this example the head noun pili 'garden' is modified by ape 'white man', but the
modifier appears with the instrumental case. This is presumably to avoid any possible
confusion with a possessive construction ('garden of a white man'), which would refer to a
specific, referential garden and not to a generic category, or perhaps to show the fact that the
gardens in question are a feature associated with the advent of white people in New Guinea
and the introduction of new food crops, but are nonetheless the property of the indigenous
people. Note that it is possible for a noun like ape to modify a traditional noun, such as ape
pdi 'cartridges', without the instrumental.","[72, 73]"

the completive marker must occur sentence finally. From the sentences in §5.2.4 we can see
that the dative suffixes occur final on the verb, but freely allow nominals to appear in the
same clause following them. Sentences such as (2 1 5) thus run counter to the prediction that82Chapter 5we would find the dative suffix final on the verb, followed by the (possibly enclitic)
completive particle. At this point we have no clear explanation for this discrepancy.","[99, 100]"
"The glides Iwl and Iji are permitted in coda position on monosyllables or word-finally (that
is, they may appear only at the right edge of a word). This means that an alternative
formulation of the permitted syllable structures for words in I'saka is that shown in Figure 8,
in which the word-final glide is structurally not part of a particular syllable but is an
extrametrical segment in the word.

orCVIIG(w, y)Figure 8: I'saka word and syllable structureUnder this model the reduplication of verb roots would apply to the whole syllable and any
extrametrical segment associated with that syllable. The fact that these extra metrical glides
cannot be realised anywhere except word-finally, however, means that the glide has no
phonetic manifestation other than serving as a buffer to intervocalic lenition. The analysis of
the reduplication of dei 'I do' is shown in (39). Here we can see that reduplication applies toPhonology31the whole phonetic syllable, which can be of the allowed shape CVG (see Table 1 4). In the
reduplicated form, however, there is no position for the now medial glide to be realised; it
blocks intervocalic lenition, but is not structurally permitted at anything other than a word­
final position, and so is not realised on the word.

EJThe reduplication of a two syllable root follows the same pattern, with the entire first
phonetic syllable reduplicated (as seen in §2.4.2). The fact that it is impossible for a glide to
be specified on the first syllable of a two (or more) -syllable word means that there is never a
conflict about the reduplication template, though interestingly this template applies to
phonetic syllables, including extrametrical material, and not to the underlyingly specified
syllable.
Note that when a complex verb collocation is irrealis, it is only the second element that
undergoes reduplication. In (40) we can see that of the two-verb collocation -ana -ung (see
§5. 3 . 3) only the second verb is reduplicated:

of a final [s] . The following examples are representative of such words (some additional
examples may be gathered from 1 0.2):
(4 1 )0::>1]
'fence'[bab::>l]
'sago grub'[k::>p]
'fence'[suzup]
'grass'[waws]
'prawn'It is likely that these above examples are loan words: traditional farming methods amongst
the people of Krisa village do not employ fences, and so these terms are suitable candidates
for borrowing from a neighbouring language, such as Mbo, a Border language spoken in
nearby Osol, a village that has moved up from the Pual basin and, along with its fenced
gardens, is only a few hours walk away from Krisa. Kocher-Schmid ( 1 999) notes that plant
names are shared extensively throughout the Kilimeri cultural area, regardless of the
relatedness or unrelatedness of the languages in question, and so the chance of these terms
being originally loans from another language, perhaps brought in as alternants or as the
names of new varieties of the plant, and then generalised, is high. Unfortunately there is
little to no linguistic information available about these interior languages, so this cannot be
tested in detail.
It is not entirely clear whether phonologically underlying glides (that is, segmental
phonemes) are permitted as word-medial syllable onsets, or whether their occurrence in this
position is a result of intervocalic epenthesis. For example, with a form such as [duw£] 'dog',
is the underlying form Idu£l, with an epenthetic glide, or Iduw£1? It is noticeable that some
intervocalic occurrences of the glide [w] consistently sound more like an onset than others.
For example, the glide in [duw£] 'dog' sounds more like a 'full' consonant than that of
[kasuW£] 'cassowary': it is perceptibly longer, is less likely to elide in fast speech, and more
likely to involve slight friction (though this is rare).","[48, 49, 50]"

[�]Orthography
ta l

taWe can see from Table 1 6 and 1 7 that the orthography favours phonemic over­
representation, as the 1 3 I'saka segments are represented by 1 7 distinct graphemes. The only
interaction between the two suprasegmental levels, tone and nasalisation, occurs when a
syllable is marked for both the high tone and nasalisation (with other than fbi or Id/ as the
onset). In this case logically either CV'ng or CVng' would be possible, but only the former is
approved. In practice, however, no instances of such a syllable have been found - all high­
tone nasal syllables occur with fbi or Id/ in the onset. This does appear to be an unusual case
of strong segmental restrictions on tonal association, involving the identity of the onset of the
syllable and the tone that attaches.
Two segment-referent graphemes, <m> and <n>, (assigned to [m] and [n], allophones of
fbi and Id/ respectively) also represent the supra segmental feature of nasalisation. As voiced
stops are realised as nasals in a nasal syllable (see §2.2.2), the feature of nasalisation may be
encoded on the onset segment-referent grapheme, and does not need to be reiterated
elsewhere in the written word. For example, the word Idi/-N 'breast' ([niD is written <ni>.
This use of segmental graphemes to show both segmental and supra segmental information
(place from the segmental tier, and also the suprasegmental feature of nasality) is an example
of an 'integrated suprasegmental representation' (San Roque 200 1 : 1 0, 36).
In several cases graphemes are assigned to allophones rather than phonemes. For example
the phoneme Idl has the distinct graphic representations <d>, <r> and <1> (as well as <n>,
described above), dependent on its allophonic realisation. This contrasts with the variants [p],
[f] and [4>], which share the single grapheme <p>. The main motivation for these different
strategies is compatibility with the phonic distinctions made in the Tok Pisin orthography.
This is not so much an abstract 'transfer concern' as an inevitable speaker preference.
The phonic awareness of current I'saka speakers is largely derived from Tok Pisin. Being
aware of the 'separateness' of the sounds [d], [1], [r] and [n] through experience of the Tok
Pisin language and orthography, Krisa people were not satisfied with a single grapheme to
represent all four. (See Phillips 1 976:38-64, for a discussion of Tok Pisin influence on
phonic awareness with reference to the Wahgi language.)
The only significant deviation from the Tok Pisin orthography is in the representation of
the suprasegmentals, nasalisation and tone, neither of which are present as contrastive
features in the Tok Pisin language. In the I'saka orthography, nasalisation on a syllable that
does not have a voiced onset (contrasting with the examples discussed above) is represented
by the digraph <ng> following the vowel, in common with the orthography of the Dumo
language, spoken on the adjacent coast to the west. For example, the word [pi'i] (younger
sister) is written <pung>. The sound correspondence of the digraph <ng> in I'saka is thus
distinct from those of the identically-formed digraphs in English, in which <ng> generally
represents the velar nasal [IJ], and sometimes the same nasal and a homorganic stop, and inPhonology37Tok Pisin, in which the same grapheme, <ng>, represents the cluster [IJg] intervocalically and
the velar nasal [IJ] in coda position.

The phonologically unmarked Low tone is also unmarked orthographically. The necessity of
distinguishing graphically between H igh and Rise tones is arguable, as contrasts between
these tones are rare. This is an important question that should be addressed if further work is
done. The application of the tone-marking scheme is limited in that only lexical roots have
been marked; bound affixes are not marked for tone. Tone density is approximately 3 5%:
that is, approximately two-thirds of the syllables of lexical roots are unmarked by diacritics
for tone.","[53, 54, 55]"

phonological level, but differ in the application of the nasalisation prosody, which affects the
whole syllable. As the voiced oral consonants fbi and Id/ are invariably realised as the nasal
stops [m] and [n] when they occur in a nasal syllable (see §2.4 . 1 , below), nasalisation in
I'saka is only truly contrastive at a syllabic rather than at a segmental level. That is, the
following syllables occur, when examined from the point of view of nasalisation ('nasal
onsets' are taken to be onsets which realise nasality if it is possible - i.e. if there is voicing in
the onset, nasality is realised. A voiceless onset, such as Ik/, cannot realise nasality, and so is
judged not to be a nasal onset in a syllable that shows a degree of nasalisation).

nasalised, if the syllable contains a nasal rhyme; it is impossible to have a syllable such as
*[ba], for instance, or *[wi], in I'saka. Nor is nasality ever found on the onset of a syllable
that has a purely oral rhyme: *[ni] or *[wu]. It is most appropriate to describe a syllable as
being specified as nasal or oral, this quality then being realised wherever possible (that is,
wherever voicing is present). We may represent the locus of the nasal contrast in I 'saka,
compared to some better-known languages, in the syllable-structure figures that follow.
English contrasts nasality only on consonants, and so only on onsets and codas: the nasality
of the onset has no effect on the choices available for nasality in the coda, and vice versa, as
seen in the independent specification for nasality in the onset and the coda in words like
numb, mad, dumb, and dab. In Japanese we can see contrastive nasalisation on the onset, or
on the rhyme as a whole. A language like French contrasts nasality on the onset, the nucleus
and the coda independently. In I'saka, nasality contrasts only at the syllable level.

n(c)I±NFigure 5: Syllable types and nasalisation in different languagesWhile unusual, systems of this type, with no systematic contrast between voiced nasal and
oral stops, are reported elsewhere in New Guinea (Voorhoeve 1 965; Clouse & Clouse 1 993).
The use of contrastive nasalisation on the nucleus is found in the area north of I'saka
(Donohue & San Roque 2000).
It is worth noting that two degrees of nasalisation are clearly present phonetically. The
degree of nasalisation that is found on the vowel of a nasal syllable which does not start with
fbi or Idl is much greater than a syllable that has one of these stops as its onset. It is worth
noting that these are the very stops that are realised as full nasal stops when they start a nasal
syllable: following the nasal stop, the degree of nasalisation on the vowel is not consistently
as strong as with a syllable that has a glide or voiceless consonant as its onset, or no onset at
all. We may represent these differences with the following chart, showing weak nasalisation
with a 'N', and strong nasalisation with 'NN'.

nasalisation on the vowel is reduced significantly. The only exception to this is the case of
syllables with glide onsets, which can show strong nasalisation on both onset and rhyme.
This asymmetry in the phonetic realisation of nasalisation is partly reflected in the
orthography, which does not mark the weak vowel nasalisation that accompanies Ibl and Idl
as onsets in nasal syllables, but in other cases marks the syllable-prosody of nasalisation as an
addition to the vowel. The above examples, 'blood' and 'tooth', are represented as mai and
kung respectively.","[35, 36, 37, 38]"
"There is good evidence that the number opposition must be modelled as two features,
singular versus non-singular, and plural versus non-plural, rather than having a single, three­
value feature. The reason that these groupings are used is that suppletive or prefixal object
marking on the verb refers to a grouping of (SG + D U ) versus PL; this suggests some
commonality between the singular and the dual, as opposed to the plural. Further, there are
some processes that refer to SG versus (DU + PL). Standard conventions apply so that [+SG]
automatically confers the value [-PL], and vice versa. By this classification dual is in a sense
an unmarked category; this surprising result is reflected in the treatment of all dual numbers
as showing the same consonant in subject prefixation (§5 .2 .2). On the other hand,
underspecification means that the dual numbers are the only ones that have to bear a marked
feature for both [SG] and [PL], albeit a negative value.
The gender system shows a clear marking pattern with masculine as the marked category,
a category composed of animate male entities and items immediately associated with them,
versus a generic 'default' non-masculine gender that is not semantically definable except as4546Chapter 4being non-masculine. In the pronouns, masculine is marked only on the singular forms, also
suggesting that masculine is more marked than non-masculine.
The formal realisation of case marking is somewhat opaque, though the formal
relationship between the possessive forms and the accusative, and the appearance of a clearly
segmentable formative -pu in the nominative, point to the fundamental difference being
between the unmarked set and the accusative set; these are the only pronoun sets that do not
show a derivational (albeit simply historical) relationship, or some overlap in function. The
free pronouns for singular are shown in Table 20.

omuThe pronouns in Table 20 show the segmental phonemes which typify the persons, and
which are also found in the verbal affixes to mark subject, object and dative. These are the
use of Idl for first person, fbi for second person, Ik/ for third person masculine, and Iwl or lui
for third person non-masculine. It is also worth noting that the accusative pronouns, marked
by a high vowel Iii and (in careful speech) lei, bear a close resemblance to the human object
suffixes (shown in Table 27), and probably reflect a close historical relationship. However,
unlike the object-marking suffixes, the accusative pronoun always precedes the verb, and is
not bound; the grammaticalisation pathway between the two forms is at best distant. There
are again striking resemblances between the accusative pronouns and the possessive ones,
which appear to consist of the reduced accusative plus the dative suffix (see §5.2.4). The
nominative set is marked by the recurrence of the final sequence pu, which shows intriguing
phonological similarities to the same sequence in other contexts (these include its appearance
as a common adverbial ending, suggesting a common sense of 'performance of an action' as
a component of the meaning of the [once-productive?] formative). Furthermore, the first
vowel of all the nominative pronouns varies between e and a : in addition to the forms listed
above, dapu, bapu, kapu and wopu (not *wapu , showing clear influence of the initial w) are
also heard for the nominative, from the same speakers that produce depu, etc . The same
applies to the last vowel of the accusative pronouns: in addition to being optionally omitted,
older speakers are known to use an a instead of e : dia, bia , kia , thus collapsing the
unmarkedlaccusative distinction for the 3 SG.M.
As mentioned above, the unmarked personal pronouns can be marked for cases. They are
able to carry a case marker for accompaniment, sa , and function as adjuncts in clauses (see
§5 . 1 .2). Like proper names, the unmarked personal pronouns may also occasionally combine
with their corresponding dative suffixes. This creates another alternative possessive pronoun.

l SG.POSSThe motivation behind a speaker's choice of the nominative pronoun + dative suffix
combination over the possessive pronouns is unclear, though it might be that the unmarked
pronoun + dative suffix strategy is more 'colloquial' or 'informal' than the use of thePronominal forms47dedicated possessive pronouns. More extensive and systematic checking of texts is needed to
confirm this hypothesis. Not enough data is available to draw any conclusions about the
discourse conditions that motivate one strategy over another, and speakers all report that the
unmarked pronoun + dative suffix strategy may replace a possessive pronoun in all contexts
queried.","[63, 64, 65]"
"Temporals have scope over the whole clause, providing a time for events relative to the
utterance. Only three distinct temporals have been identified: kelie (or, sometimes, kelia)
'yesterday, before today' , buru 'today, now', and ba la 'tomorrow, later on '. Deictics
similarly exhibit three distinct forms, but the contrast encoded in the different forms is not a
simple one of spatial distance. The proximal and distal deictics are opposed in space, but the
third deictic has a discourse function rather than a spatial function. Three postpositions
(expressing location, accompaniment and instrumental) are also found.
Five clause-final particles have been identified, and it is expected that others also exist.
These cover a range of semantic and grammatical functions. Their domain includes tense/
aspect/mood and negation; they have been grouped together on the basis of their common
position in, and scope over, the clause.
Additionally there are several other particles and word-types that are only rarely found in
our data and are poorly understood. These remain unclassified on semantic or morphological
grounds, though they are listed in §3 .5.",[57]

"The accusative pronouns are restricted to pronominal arguments serving as the object of a

"78Chapter 55.5. 1Personal pronounsWe can note that the accusative pronouns bear a close resemblance to the human object
suffixes shown in Table 27 (§5 .2. 3). However, unlike the suffixes, the accusative pronoun
always precedes the verb. The recurrence of the sequence -pu in the nominative set is
interesting, as this possible morpheme/formative is exemplified in the data in other contexts
(most regularly, adverbs are also usually formed with -pu). Its putative independent meaning
appears to be something like 'emphatic ' or 'means of action '. This can be seen in the
following example, in which the appearance of the -pu seems to imply a strong causal link
between the two clauses:

'If there's no rain tomorrow, then I 'll go to the garden. 'Other support for the argument that this i s a (fossilised) morpheme is the fact that the
intervocalic /p/ is not prone to lenition - see §2 . 3 . 1 . The nominative form of the pronoun
is restricted to referents serving as the subject of the verbal clause, either bivalent or
monovalent, or the subject of a non-verbal clause. Some examples are:

"2.2.2 NasalisationAs mentioned earlier, I'saka exhibits contrastive nasalisation, even though no nasal
consonants or vowels have been listed in §2. 1 . The appearance of a nasalisation contrast is
not unexpected, but the realisation of that contrast deserves special discussion for I'saka,
which will be provided in this section. The contrasts shown by nasalisation can be
exemplified in the minimal pairs shown in Table 7.",[35]

(Note here also the use of second person singular prefixes, consistent with
a command, despite the vocative use of a [necessarily third person]
nominal sentence-initially.)It is not known what motivates a speaker's choice of one of these constructions over the
other. An alternative mode of inflection for object is found productively with verbs that take
an adjunct nominal, and use the dative suffixes to mark the affected experiential object.
The second class of bivalent verbs, the vast majority of verbs in the lexicon, normally
shows no marking for object.","[80, 81]"

inflected for 2SG subject. As imperative clauses are generally pragmatically restricted to
second person in any case, this might be plausible, except for the fact that examples of 2PL
and 2DU subjects also show mu, not *yfng (putatively expected, if the hypothesised ung was
an inflecting verb). It should also be noted that this construction was heard very rarely,

"4. 1. 1 Unmarked pronounsThe unmarked pronoun is the most common and flexible form of the pronoun, appearing
in a wider range of contexts than any of the other pronominal sets. The referent can be a
subject or dative referent, and at times the unmarked set of pronouns is even used as
possessive pronouns. Additionally, an overtly marked oblique pronoun must be drawn from
the unmarked set (such as accompanying participants, which are marked with tro attached to
a pronoun from the unmarked set, as in (95) in §5 . 1 .2). The only restriction on the function
of this pronominal set is that it may not be used to mark a referent which is the object of a
bivalent clause.
It is not yet well understood what motivates the choice of the unmarked pronominal forms
when a more highly specified, and equally suitable pronominal set is available for the
function required, such as the nominative pronouns for subjects or the possessive pronouns
for objects.
Examples of the use of the unmarked pronouns in different syntactic contexts appear in
the sentences below.

expressed with a dative suffix on the verb: Kapu k-ele-ung 'He went to
her', Kepu k-au-na 'He came to me'.)48Chapter 4From the wide range of functions in which the unmarked set of pronouns appears it is
clear that they are not specified for grammatical features other than the pronominal ones that
they exist to mark.","[65, 66]"
"Phonology33This means that a large number of otherwise potentially permissible syllables are not
attested, those of the form pdV (G)/, /bdV (G)/, ItdV (G)/ and IsdV (G)/ . It is suggestive about
a possible earlier segmental stage of the nasalisation prosody, in which syllable-final nasals
were perhaps permitted (recall that there are no unambiguous codas in modern I'saka). It
might have been the case that, in a language that permitted CVGN and CCVG, the sequence
CCVGN was too 'heavy', and so barred from appearing. An alternative account of this
restriction is presented below.
Synchronically, we can summarise the phonotactic restrictions associated with nasality
and its interaction with initial clusters in Table 1 5 .
Table 15: Nasalisation and consonant clusters#CV(G)#
#CCV(G)#- Nasal+ Nasal[pv ] 'arrow'
[pIV ] 'bad'[p�Jl 'sling'
* [plaj]The constraint against a complex onset in a nasalised syllable may simply reflect the fact
that [1] is an allophone of Id/ in I'saka, which is realised as [n] in a nasal syllable; the resulting
stop+nasal cluster is phonotactically impossible in the language, and so must be separated by
a vowel, resulting in two syllables with no complex onset.
There is some historical evidence that supports this: the Proto Macro-Skou word for 'head'
is reconstructable as *tlfl, attested (apart from I'saka) from evidence such as Wutung IhlG/,
Dumo ItG/, Sumararu Ilul 'head'. In I'saka the cognate word is [tanu]-LR , clearly two
syllables. Only in I'saka are [1] and [n] allophones of the same phoneme, and so only in I'saka
is the original cluster realised as **tn, which is then resyllabified with an intrusive vowel, to
yield the modern [ta.nu]. Other possible candidates for *CIV > CalV (> ICadV/) in I'saka
include *klfl 'ear', > [tari]; a possible cluster in a non-nasalised syllable that remains in I'saka
is *-pl- 'near' (Skou: lalapalili), which is reflected in I'saka as [(ju)plow], with the cluster
retained. Most other instances of reconstructable *CI are reflected in Krisa as *C alone, so
this hypothesis remains speculative. (Although only I'saka shows allophonic variation
between stop and nasal, there is plentiful evidence pointing at sporadic cross-over between b
and m, and between l and n in the other languages).","[50, 51]"
"6.3 NegationNegation can be marked only once for the clause, and it is always at the end of the clause,
following both the predicate and any oblique nominals that are in clause-final position.
The negative particle, mi, is invariant for person, number, gender or tense/aspect/mood
distinctions:

"5. 7.5 DubitativeThe dubitative marker wo is found at the end of clauses as a marker of uncertainty on the
part of the speaker about the truth of the utterance. It may be used as a marker of
evidentiality, to indicate that the speaker is not vouching for the veracity of the statement, or
it may be a marker of uncertainty about the future plausibility of the sentence:

wo . . .
tomorrow 3SG.NM.come-RED DUB
'She might come tomorrow (but I 'm not sure).'",[102]
"2. 6.3 A note on contrasts and positionsFrom the material in the previous sections it can be seen that monosyllables in I'saka show
the greatest number of contrasts of syllables in the language. They show a greater range of
possibilities in this regard primarily because they may include a syllable-initial cluster (e.g,
[pl'l-i ] 'bad' compared to [PV] 'arrow'), which is not possible for the syllables of polysyllabic
words.
Additionally, the word-initial slot is the position in which consonantal segments are
maximally distinct from each other. Word-initial onsets contrast for place and manner of
articulation, as well as voicing (see examples in §2. 1 . 1 ). However, in word-medial position,
voice and manner distinctions are lost owing to intervocalic lenition. The sets of bilabial
stops (/p <1>1 and fbI), and the dentoalveolar It! and lsI, no longer contrast. It is possible that
this has led to a reanalysis of all intervocalic occurrences of [13] and [z] as Ip <1>1 and lsI
,....",[51]
"Despite the invariant position of the negative marker at the end of the whole clause, the
scope does not necessarily apply over the entire clause. In the following construction, which
contains both an accompaniment and a locative oblique argument following the verb, the
accompaniment argument can be negated without negating the rest of the clause:
(272)Tani ' k-ele '
moni' tro pli
mi.
father 3SG.M-go mother with garden NEG
'Dad went to the garden without Mum.'",[110]
"5.2. 4 Argument inflection using the dative suffixA range of non subcategorised participants are marked on the verb using the dative suffix.
The fact that the nominal is peripheral can be judged by its appearance in a postverbal
position, a position reserved for oblique arguments. 3 Although there is a large range of
possible referents, with different and non-conflicting semantic roles, only one instance of the
dative suffix may appear in any one clause; the criteria for choosing which of the possible
referents of the dative suffix will be chosen in the event of two or more possible candidates
are not yet known, though it does seem that, while semantically not incompatible, it is
unlikely from a discourse point of view that two of the possible candidates for coding will
appear in the one clause.
This suffix demands an animate referent, and can be used to encode recipient,
beneficiary, goal, experiencer and possessor (usually the possessor of the object of a bivalent
verb). The forms of the dative suffix are shown in Table 28, and some examples of its use
are reproduced below. Some forms are identical to the human object suffixes shown in
Table 27.

-iThe different functions of the dative suffix will be exemplified in the rest of this section,
followed by a discussion of some optional appearances of the suffixes. Here we can see the
use of the dative suffix with recipient, beneficiary, goal, experiencer and possessor referents.
In all cases, if there is a nominal referring to the same argument that is coded on the verb
with the dative suffixes it must appear postverbally.
3An argument for treating postverbal nominals as truly oblique, and not simply obliquely coded core
arguments (such as the datives of many European languages) is presented in §6. 1 .2.",[81]

It is interesting to note that, while the free pronominal forms show a lot of overlap in
function, at its extreme with the unmarked pronouns occurring in almost all functions, the
verbal affixes are completely distinct. There is no variation in the use of verbal affixes in a
given morphosyntactic construction: given the construction, the choice of the bound
pronominal form is fixed. On the other hand a free pronoun, if used, can in many cases be
either of two possibilities, since the unmarked pronominal set overlaps functionally with the
nominative, accusative and possessive pronouns.
4.2 Interrogative pronounsIn addition to the personal pronouns listed above, which are unique in l'saka in being a
non-bound word class that shows multiple distinctions for case, there is also a small set of
mainly non-human interrogative pronouns. Not all of these are single morphemes, with
'when' and 'where (location)' showing the instrumental suffix -ri in a lexicalised and
idiosyncratic usage. All the known interrogatives are listed in Table 24.","[68, 69]"
"We can see in these examples that the postverbal accompaniment NP does not contribute
to the set of pronominal features that are marked on the verb: in (93) the verb is marked for
a singular subject, and indeed plural marking is ungrammatical in this case. I f the
accompanier is presented in the subject position with the affix -sing, from sie 'two', then the
verb takes dual marking, as in:
(94)Bala
Simon-sing
s-ele '-le'
Pasi.
tomorrow Simon-DU.ACCOM I DU-go-RED Pasi
'Tomorrow Simon and 1 are going to Pasi. ' lAnother use of tro i s almost instrumental in function, though i t i s less of a n 'intermediary
agent' than a -ri marked instrument. An example of this use is:
(95)Ubuei
tey
omu-tro
we owai.
poison.root milk/sap 3SG.NM-ACCOM fish 3 PL.die
'Fish die because of the sap of the poisonous vine. '
(The regular form of the 3SG.NM pronoun is umu (see §4. 1 ); the lowered
initial vowel here might be due to the presence of the low vowel in the
suffix - tro , or it might be a dissimilatory effect brought on by the
preceding high glide in tey.)Here we can see that a non-agentive effector is marked not as an A, but as an oblique
cause, while the patient is marked as the S of the clause.
It is also worth noting the identity in form between the accompaniment marker tro and the
locational noun tro 'inside'. Similar syncretism between duwe ' 'ground', 'outside' can also be
found (see § l O. l ).",[74]
"3.2 NounsNouns are the most phonotactically varied of the word classes, with no restrictions on their
phonological shape (unlike verbs, see §3.3). Morphologically nouns are uninflected for
gender, number, or other categories, but are divided into two genders, masculine, M, and non­
masculine, NM . Gender is realised only through verbal morphology, in the choice of prefix,Chapter 340suffix, or suppletive stem forms of verbs. The non-masculine gender is the unmarked form,
found with most animals, although some (e.g. pigs, the most culturally important and valued
animal) are masculine. Natural powers such as wind and rain are predominantly masculine,
with au 'moon' and (po)kisi 'night' being expected exceptions (this conforms to the cross­
linguistic data in Craig 1 986). Inanimate things such as plants and features of the landscape,
as well as household items, are almost exclusively non-masculine.
I n addition to the pervasive, but morphologically unmarked in the NP, gender distinction
there is also a division between animate referents and inanimates. This is discussed in §5 .3.3,
where the choice of verb of location appears to be governed by pragmatic animacy factors.
There is evidence for some additional classing behaviour in I'saka, though it is no longer
productive, and shows no concord anywhere in the language. We can observe, however, a
more than chance series of phonological correspondences:
•
•
••nearly all birds show an initial [i] or [j] ;
furry game animals show an initial [a];
many hairless (and grammatical non-masculine) creatures, such as lizards and
various water creatures, show an initial [u] or [w];
bandicoots tend to begin with [bi].
(examples can be seen in the word lists in Chapter 1 0)While this has not been thoroughly checked, there does appear to be a strong tendency in
the Border languages Mnanki (and Man�m) for the names of birds to start with [i] or [j], and
for water creatures and game creatures to show an initial [a], and so on. This is also possibly
true in Fakmo (Bewani) as well, although in this language it is less striking (own fieldnotes,
2002-03).","[57, 58]"

followed. A, S and P have been used descriptively to represent the syntactic roles of most
agentive arguments of a primary transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as it does),
single argument of an intransitive predicate, and most patientive argument of a primary
transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as they do), respectively, following Comrie

the morpheme line: the hyphen '- ' is used to separate morphemes forming one phonological
,
word, and a space ' is used to mark off separate words. Punctuation marks are used
according to English conventions. The usual star ' *' is used to indicate an ungrammatical
utterance, while a hash '#' is used for one that is either infelicitous for a particular context, or
else acceptable only for some speakers, or one about which speakers vacillate in their
judgements from time to time.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"72Chapter 5Some examples of other adjunct nominals that are frequently found, and the verbs that
they have been heard with, include (but are not restricted to):
wang
sit
dou
susup
kasue
suwe'song'
'sago'
'hand'
'grass'
'cassowary'
'laughter'wang k-ei

kasue k-ei
suwe k-usue'He sings. '
'He processes sago.'
'He claps. '
'He cleans/cuts grass. ,t
'He shoots a cassowary.'
'He laughs. 't This collocation requires the plural object form of the verb 'get', since cuttinggrass necessarily involves cutting more than just one blade - see §5 .2.3.
Although this area of I'saka syntax has not been investigated in detail, it is easy to note the
ease with which independent nouns can be used with their culturally appropriate meaning,
and the ease with which Tok Pisin loans are incorporated into the language by means of this
construction, such as bal k-ei 'he plays with a ball', raitim k-ei 'he writes'Joto k-ei 'he takes
a photo', helpim k-ei 'he helps' (a synonym with the construction using native I'saka
morphemes makaing k-ei 'help(?) he-does'), we i k-ei 'he waits ' « Tok Pisin we tim;
synonymous k-akaing 'he waits', with the same morphosyntax, involving a dative-coded P),
or wari k-ei 'he worries'. For this last reading the native I'saka equivalent does not use an
adjunct nominal, but rather a purely nominal construction:
( 1 63)Nana bou plai-na .
throat bad- 1 SG.DAT
l SG
'I'm worried. 'The accusative case may, for some speakers, also be used here: #Die bou plaina, though
the apparently topic- like prominence of the l sG body-part possessor argument in this
construction makes this a less common strategy; this is in contrast to the common use of the
accusative pronouns in constructions with adjunct nominals (see, for instance ( 1 3 2), in which
the accusative pronouns are more normal, because the subject position in the clause is not
filled by the adjunct nominals ta l or nika nua.
This sort of nominal construction, using modified body parts to predicate an emotional or
socially recognised condition, is found in other collocations as well without the dative
suffixes:
( 1 64)Nana you
kaipa .
stomach one
1 SG
'I 'm cool about it. 'I 'I'm content. '/'I 'm not making a fuss over it. 'The fact that the patently recent loans are fully incorporated into the morphosyntactic
system of I'saka, and are not (at least obvious) examples of code-switching, can be seen in
their occurrence with the full range of inflection, as in the following two examples, in which
the Tok Pisin nounsfoto 'photograph' and save 'knowledge' are used in I'saka sentences.

"2. 1. 1 ConsonantsI'saka has seven consonantal phonemes, evenly distributed between voiced and voiceless
members. These segments are distributed somewhat asymmetrically, with no complete place
or manner series represented in all manners or places: velar place, for instance, shows only a
single (voiceless) stop, while bilabial is represented only by a voiced stop. The contrasts that
we must establish are shown in Table 1 ; problematic contrasts are shown in brackets.

bilabial - (dento)alveolar - velar, and in voicing. Among the alveolar consonants,
[continuant] is also a contrastive feature (though see §2.3.4 for the historical development of
the [s] segment). A distinctive glide series is also present, differing in place of articulation
(labiovelar vs palatal). Some examples of minimal or near-minimal word-initial contrasts
are shown in Table 2 .

Contrastive nasalisationon the segments of 'bird' Ijul is represented as N; both these notations follow the transcription of
segments between slashes. For more details on tone, see §2.2. 1 , and for nasalisation see §2.2.2.)In word-medial position a vastly reduced range of stop consonants is present, with only
place contrasting, and all manner and voicing distinctions being neutralised. See §2.3 for a
discussion of the reduced contrasts available in this position. Word finally there are no stops
in native words (see §2.6. 1 ).
The phonemic status of the voiceless bilabials is problematic. The phones [p] and [4>] (and
also occasionally [fn are heard in non-contrastive free variation, with no discernible
environmental motivation. Although we can observe some tendencies, they are not consistent
enough to posit allophony. One interpretation is that there were originally two voiceless
bilabial phonemes contrasting in manner of articulation, and these are currently merging,
(perhaps motivated by the lack of such a contrast in Tok Pisin and neighbouring languages
such as Dumo, Dusur, Ningera and Bo). Alternatively, the phones once shared an allophonic
relationship that has become confused. For the sake of consistency, [p], [4>] and [f] will be
treated as realisations of a phoneme Ip/.","[31, 32]"
"62Chapter 5Those forms that are known are shown in Table 27, followed by some examples. It should
be noted that the human object suffixes bear the same 'signature' person/gender phonemes
(/dI: 1 sG, fb/: 2sG, 1kI: 3 SG.M and /w/: 3SG.NM) as the subject prefixes. These onsets tend not
to lenite intervocalically, implying that there are different degrees of morpheme juncture
involved here, possibly involving c1iticisation, compared to the lenition that occurs when
subject prefixes are reduplicated (support, albeit circumstantial, for this position is the
ambiguity of the position of the dative suffixes when in proximity to the completive marker
- see §S.7. 1 ).

'I 'll hold the boy on my lap. 'All observed occurrences of the human object suffixes are on verbs of carrying and
holding, such as shown with -opa 'carry on shoulder' and -epa 'place (on lap)' in sentences
( 1 09) and ( 1 1 0), and also (not exemplified here) -aisuso 'carry on side, carry on hip' and the
more generic -asa 'carry'. The use of the appropriate object suffix is obligatory in those
constructions exemplified above, and has not been observed, or accepted, with any other
verbs. We might reasonably assume that any bivalent verb that could satisfy the semantic
criteria (which we might define as 'envelopment of an animate (human?) object') would also
combine with the suffixes, but no verbs other than those listed here have been recorded with
the object suffixes. The fact that another verb of carrying, -asei 'carry by attaching to a pole
on shoulder', does not allow for object suffixes implies that the envelopment part of the
semantics is important.
A few examples have been noted of 'carrying' verbs being used in an alternative
construction, in series with the verb -ei 'do', as in example ( 1 1 1 ) below. In this instance, the
human object suffix is omitted. The use of an accusative object-referencing pronoun, such as
die, is, however, obligatory.","[79, 80]"
"2.2. 1 ToneI'saka distinguishes four pitch contrasts on single syllables. These are a H igh 'H' and a
Low 'L' level tone, and the contour tones Rise 'R ' (decomposable into LH) and Fall 'F'
(decomposable into H L). Some examples of monosyllabic minimal or near-minimal
contrasts are shown below.

'language'On polysyllabic words the distinctions in tones can be very subtle. The difference between
a LH and a LR is very slight, since there is a degree of assimilation in pitch between the two
syllables, leading to a L having a slight rising off-glide when a following syllable contains a
high pitch. Given that syllables are not strictly separated by silence, and that intervocalic
consonants all ienite, which involves voicing, both a putative LH and LR will be expected to
have pitch contours something like [---] and [--I] respectively, with minimal differentiation.
They can, however, be distinguished in the speech of careful speakers when they talk slowly.
The combinations that have been found on monomorphernic disyllabic roots can be seen in
Table 6. It is immediately apparent that less than half the theoretically possible tone patterns
(4 x 4) which might be expected on disyllabic roots are actually found. Specifically, there are
no combinations involving a falling pitch on one syllable of a word, low-low is the only
sequence of two identical tones found, and the sequence high-rise has not been observed.
The fact that we do not find any sequences of adjacent syllables with identical marked
pitches on both syllables implies some working of the Obligatory Contour Principle, requiring
that there be a change in the parameter [pitch] from one tone-bearing unit to the next. The
admissibility of sequences of two low-pitched syllables in a row, rather than refuting this
hypothesis, implies that, rather than being a specified tone, at least some instances of
phonetic low pitch contour do in fact represent syllables that are phonologically toneless or
underspecified for a tone value. The absence of a high-rise sequence is perhaps motivated by
the difficult of rising from an already high pitch to a yet higher one. The absence of a falling
pitch in combination on disyllables is suggestive of a rule, either prohibiting a F adjacent toPhonology17another tonally specified syllable in the same phonological word, or else a rule of tone sandhi
altering the F to another pitch contour. Since these are monomorphernic roots, and as such
do not show any further interaction between their syllables, these hypotheses cannot be tested.
An alternative explanation is that tone is in fact assigned at a word level in I 'saka: the
disyllabic correlate of H is RH ; that of L, LL; that of R is both LH and LR, and the correlate
of F is both HL and RL (alternatively, and perhaps more justified, we find a new LHL
melody that cannot be realised on monosyllables, but is realised over words of two or more
syllables). This would then match the word-tone systems observed in the (distantly) related
coastal languages Skou, Puare, Leitre (Donohue 2002a) and Barupu (Crowther 2000). The
fact that the morpheme yung 'bird', which has a falling tone, is heard with a low pitch in
some compounds, such as [jilru] [- I] 'forest pigeon', supports the notion that the I'saka tone
system is word-based, not syllable-based. In the case of the word cited, we would presume
that the falling tone of yung is overwritten by a rising tone associated with the bound root ru.
See Donohue ( 1 997) for discussion of the typology of tone systems in New Guinea. Much
more data is needed before this hypothesis can be confirmed.

The only trisyllabic word in our corpus that might even possibly be monomorphemic is
susuwang 'dragonfly', and even this is suspicious (we can note the possible reduplication
of the su syllable, for instance). As a result of the scarcity of data on unambiguously
monomorphemic words longer than two syllables, we cannot draw any conclusions about the
shape of pitch contours on longer expressions. There does not appear to be any interaction
between the tones of adjacent lexical items in a phrase or clause.","[34, 35]"
"3.5.3 PronounsThe language distinguishes three numbers in its pronouns, as well as contrastive gender in
the third person singular (but nowhere else). Uniquely in the language, the pronouns are
marked for different cases, contrasting nominative, accusative, and possessive pronouns, as
well as an unmarked set of underspecified pronouns, and various bound forms that appear on
nouns, adjectives and verbs.
Because of the complexities involved in the description of pronouns, concerning not just
morphology but also restrictions and requirements to do with their syntactic environments,
they are not described here, but in the next chapter.",[61]
"2Chapter 1more likely candidates for genetic relatedness to I'saka than is Asmat or any of its relatives.
Morphologically, I'saka shows more similarities with the Melanesian Austronesian pattern
than the 'typical' Papuan pattern (that is, the highlands Trans New Guinea pattern that is
usually evoked when referring to Papuan languages), with strict word order, no case-marking
particles, and relatively simple morphology. Syntactically, I'saka is mainly right-headed at
the clause level, but left-headed within the NP, as is to be expected (Dryer 1 98 8). The
language makes extensive use of light verbs (§5.3 . 1 , 5 . 3 .2), sometimes with a semantically
specifying nominal, and sometimes without, relying on either discourse-contextual knowledge
or on shared cultural knowledge concerning the activities performed with different things to
resolve ambiguities. These points will all be examined in detail from Chapter 2 on, following
a discussion of the sociolinguistic factors that are at play in the Krisa community.
1.1BackgroundThe village of Krisa is situated approximately 20km south of Vanimo, the capital of
Sandaun Province (formerly West Sepik), in the extreme north-west of Papua New Guinea.
The location of Krisa and Pasi with respect to the local provincial capital of Vanimo, and the
closer town of Ossima in the Pual river basin, is shown in Figure 1 . The villages north of the
Oenake range represent those that speak languages related to I 'saka in the (smaller) Skou
family, from Skou Mabo in the west through to Vanimo. Between the Bewani mountains and
this range, along the course of the Pual river, are the languages of the Bewani (Border
languages) group, unrelated to the Skou languages. In the Bewani mountains to the southeast
are some northern hamlets of Fas-speaking peoples such as Yo, relatives of whom have
spilled over into the Serra Hills in the last few decades, but these areas remain sparsely
populated.
NINem�
NjaoBewani
•Figure 1: Map of Krisa and surrounding villages and the I'saka language areaIntroduction3The village is on the southern end of a plateau split by numerous small rivers at an altitude
of approximately 300-400m, and looks south across the Pual valley to the Bewani mountains
(see Figure 1 ). The location of Krisa and its surrounds in a broader New Guinea context is
shown in Figure 2. In this map the shaded area represents the area of the map seen in
Figure 1 .
Krisa can be reached by a four-hour walk along a dirt road from Pasi, which is accessible
by vehicle from Vanimo. The population of the village itself numbers approximately 600
(more than half of whom are children), and nearly the same number of people live in
outlying settlement camps that follow the road to the coast (Klappa 1 99 9a, 1 999d),
terminating in Pasi, the last I'saka-speaking settlement, which lies just off the northern slopes
of the Oenake ranges. Finally, a few Krisa families live in Vanimo town; no Krisa people
live further away than the surrounding villages, where they are found due to marriage to
Osol, Osima or Ningera. This yields a total possible population for the ethnic group of
somewhat less than 1 000.","[19, 20, 21]"

"1. 4.2 Adult literacyA school has been operating in Krisa since the 1 950s (Kocher Schmid 1 999) and the
majority of the adult population is literate, to varying degrees. The literacy spectrum ranges
from some of the older villagers, who find writing their names an extremely challenging task,
to the handful of adults who must use literacy skills frequently in their employment or in legal
and business concerns.
When adults have occasion to write, they usually write in Tok Pisin. However it is hard to
define the role literacy has in intra-village life, as few tasks demand it. Like the English
language, it is something that is more to do with negotiating the outside world (in the form,
for example, of logging royalty contracts and land claims). Newspapers that find their way
to Krisa are less likely to be read than rolled around tobacco and smoked.",[29]
"6.1 Word orderrsaka clauses and phrases exhibit a quite strict word order, though there are pragmatic
alternatives for many constructions. This section starts with an overview of clausal word
order, and then proceeds into noun phrases. This order of presentation has been chosen to
follow the possibilities for adjectives, which can in many instances appear outside the NP of
the noun they modify.",[103]
"5.2.3 Object inflectionIndependent bivalent verbs can be divided into two morphologically distinct classes. The
first class, a minority pattern, marks the gender and number (singular/dual being relevantly
grouped together as non-plural, NPL, opposed to plural, PL) of the object on the verb. This
may be accomplished in one of two ways: either through the use of suppletive verb-forms, or
through the use of more delimitable affixation - 'delimitable' in the sense that the
correspondences of pronominal values to the segments employed for their encoding match
the paradigms seen elsewhere. (In fact, calling this 'affixation' may be jumping the gun as
there are too few examples known to be sure that we are really dealing with regular affixes
that mean 'masculine non-plural object', etc., as opposed to patterns of lexical suppletion.)
Table 26 shows two examples of the class of verbs that mark some value of the object by
suppletive verb forms; the examples given here have been inflected for first person singular
subject (d-) as well as the inflection for object. The first example, with the verb -ai 'get' ,
shows what may b e analysable a s object affixes. The rightmost column illustrates the
patterns found with the verb -ei 'do', and shows object-governed suppletion, or at best objectMorphology61affixation and major morphophonological changes. Although the prevalence of suppletive
forms makes it difficult to posit a root for the verb 'do', the third person non-masculine
object form -ei is considered to be the most unmarked, in terms of its range of application,
frequency of occurrence, and appearance in elicitation. As such, it has been treated as the
underlying form throughout.
Table 26: Object prefixes'take, get', [-aj]'do', [-ej]SUBJOBJl SG3NPL.NMd-aid-ei3NPL.Md-akaid-o3PLd-alaid-ouIf the verb 'take' in the table above illustrates a productive (or at least regular, and not
entirely suppletive) object marking pattern, then the morphemes used to index the values of
,
the object are prefixal to the verb root; the morphological structure of 'I take (masculine)
would most logically be PrefsuBJ-PrefoBJ-V, as in the following segmented example.
( 1 07)d-ak-ai
l SG-3SG.NPL.M-take
,
'I take (masculine)Here the use of the k consonant in the prefix is reminiscent of the appearance of this
consonant in various places in paradigms involving third person singular masculine
arguments. We would posit the prefixes ak- and al-, the only consonant-final morphemes in
the language. With 'do', however, it is hard to isolate a single element that can be said to be
added to an otherwise basically invariant verb root. It could well be the case that prefixes of
the form V- and VG- are added and the rhyme of the prefix overwrites that of the verb root,
in a process similar to that described for vowel coalescence when subject prefixes of the
shape CV - are added to verbs (§5 .2.2). If this is the case, the prefixes are 0- '3NPL.M .OBJ'
and ou- 'PL.OBJ' (/'Jw/). An example of the verb 'do' inflected for non-plural masculine
object is given in:
( 1 08)[d'J]
/d-'J-Ej!
l SG.sUBJ-3SG.NPL.M.OBJ-do
'I do (masculine).'
(See §5.2.2 for a discussion of the process of rhyme replacement in verbs
following the syllabification of extrametrical elements, arguing that rather
than simply vowel replacement, there is a more complex process involved.)For ease of glossing, only the features 'plural ' and 'masculine' will be indicated in the
gloss lines, as these seem to represent elements that, historically at least, were added to the
roots. Thus, d-ei will be glossed simply as l sG-do, not l SG-do.NPL.NM ; d-o will be glossed
as l sG-do.M, and d-ou as l sG-do.pL. The features non-singular and non-masculine will not
be explicitly marked in the glosses, as they represent the unmarked categories.
In addition to these verbs with irregular (in the sense of less easily segmentable) means of
marking object values on the verb, a small and semantically distinct subset of this class takes
a regular set of suffixes that indicate number, person and gender of a human object (H .OBJ).","[78, 79]"
"2.5.3 Glide deletionAt a surface-phonemic level we require a rule by which glides are deleted before a
consonant. This rule is clearly one that can only apply in non-monomorphemic environments,
otherwise there would be no evidence for the existence of the glide in the first place. We may
express the rule as follows:28Chapter 2
(31)G � 0/ _CAlternations are detectable when a verb shows reduplication for irrealis mood, as
described in §2.4.2. The example below shows how irrealis reduplication of the syllable
[now] ' l sG-eat' results in [n:mow] not *[nownow]. When the root, /d-::Jw/-N, a monosyllable,
is reduplicated a sequence of glide plus stop is created. The glide in the resulting first syllable
is not realised, and the vowel of that first syllable is not raised, as would be expected in a
diphthong environment.
NNI(32)/d-::Jw/ � [now]
' l SG -eat'I/d::JW/<IRR>�NNII[dowdow]
N NII[d::Jdow]
� [mnow] * [nownow]
�Alternatively, one could argue that the reduplicative morpheme specifies a CV template
(including, additionally, the nasality and tone specification of the root), rather than the
proposed entire syllable template. If this were the case the glide would not require deletion,
but would simply not be included in the reduplication template:
(33)/d-::Jw/-N
CV�/d::J-d::Jw/-NN�[n::Jnow]The behaviour of reduplicated non-nasal monosyllables, however, suggests that it is the
whole syllable that is being reduplicated, and that the glide is subsequently deleted so as to
avoid the occurrence of a disallowed cluster (*GC). For example, reduplication on the l SG
subject-inflected verb /d-£j! ' l SG-do' results in [d£dej] not *[d£lej], which we would predict
from the /d/ � [1] rules outlined above. The presence of the glide blocks the /d/ � [1]
process, as the required environment of V_V is not present. (This analysis assumes that d­
lateralisation occurs before glide deletion):
(34)� [dej]
/d-£j!
' l SG-do'/d-£j!<IRR>�{d£jd£j} (d � 1 does not apply)
� [d£dej]The fact that nasality, a syllable-level feature, is also copied to the reduplicant (with 'I will
eat' the grammatical output in (32) is [n::Jnow], and not *[d::Jnow]) suggests that at least the
prosodic syllable, and not just some segmental elements of it, is copied.
An alternative account of the process of reduplication, based on a more considered
analysis of word and syllable structure in I'saka, is presented in §2.6.1.","[45, 46]"
