Dóòhseewa why, how come is an interrogative pro-adverb. It is derived by adding the focus
particle -wa to the stative D-word dóòhsee to be the matter (see 12.2.5). Dóòhseewa is used in
wh-questions where the focus element of question is the reason, as in the questions in (67) and

the numeral is pluralized to emphasize that the group consists of individuals (see 4.2.2). The
difference between dáàwi and iidáàwi requires further description, but the latter seems to be

*Dúàhga when is a bound root that occurs only with clause-final and adverbial suffixes.
Like other Siouan languages, Hidatsa has distinct forms of ‘when’ that distinguish
between realized (or realis) past events and unrealized (or irrealis) future and hypothetical events.
Questions about the future and unrealized or hypothetical events are formed by
combining *dúàhga when with the irrealis conditional suffix -rúg (see 17.4.1.2), as in (69)–(71).
The main verb has to be marked with the irrealis prefix aru- / oo- (see 6.5.3) or one of the future
tense suffixes (see 6.5.2). The same irrealis prefixes or future suffixes are used in the answer. If
the answer is a verbless sentence, it is marked for irrealis by other means, such as with the
abilitative suffix -hahgá in (70) or the conditional suffix -rúg in (71).",[460]
"6.5.2 Future
Hidatsa and Crow are the only Siouan languages that indicate the future tense by inflection.
Whereas in Crow it is accomplished by incorporating an inflected auxiliary verb into the verb
stem (Graczyk 2007: 137, 302), in Hidatsa the future marker has become completely
grammaticalized and is realized in statements (see 6.1.1) by a set of suffixes that distinguish
person and also distinguish number in first and second person. All future statements are doubly
inflected with pronominal prefixes and future suffixes. Plurality of first and second person plural
forms is indicated doubly by the plural future suffix and the appropriate plural suffix (-ˀa or -ˀo).
The inventory of future statement suffixes is given in TABLE 6.14.

"222Another unique area that has been overlooked or misanalyzed in previous descriptions of
Hidatsa is the cumulative exponence of the notions of posture, evidentiality, and aspect in three
interrelated sets of position, or posture, verbs. There are ten or eleven such verbs, most of which
occur in Jones’s field notes. Boyle (2007: 178) describes five, overgeneralizing or misanalyzing
all but one of them, and provides incorrect plural forms for all except one. Since Boyle identified
only five posture verbs he was unable to describe them as interrelated sets.
Since the morphological categories comprising modal notions are clearly the most
misunderstood — yet paradoxically the best “known” features in Hidatsa — I will provide more
examples and data in each subsection of this chapter than is the usual practice in descriptive
grammars. I will raise a few questions and identify aspects that need further clarification, but in
the end I hope to provide a comprehensive description of the notions of modality, aspect, and

preceded by the second person future suffix -rihi that is used only in questions. The same

"11.2.5 Ergative pronoun iirahéèri
Hidatsa has developed a paradigm of ergative pronouns that are used to emphasize or contrast
the ergative agent in transitive clauses. The ergative pronoun iirahéèri is also used in response to
questions to identify the agent . Ergative demonstratives hirirí, guarí, and seˀrí (plural hiróˀri,
gúúˀari, and sííˀari) are often used instead of the third person pronoun. The paradigm of the

"6.1 Speech-act modality
According to the speech act theory first put forward by Austin (1962) and later developed further
by Searle (1969), the speech acts that we produce proceed from the context of the situation in
which they are produced and are therefore pragmatic acts, rather than mere linguistic acts.
Hidatsa is one of those languages that has grammaticalized the implied, or intended meaning, of
every speech act in addition to its literal meaning. Thus, the propositional content of every
utterance (or locutionary act) is always combined with an indicator of the illocutionary force of
that utterance. The illocutionary force of every well-formed Hidatsa utterance (in the simplest
case an independent clause) is indicated by an obligatory matrix clause-final marker.
The main purpose of speech-act markers in Hidatsa is to add illocutionary force to the
locutionary, or literal meaning, of an utterance. The speech-act markers do not alter the
223propositional content of utterances, they merely permit us to draw inferences about the speaker’s
intentions, assumptions, and attitudes. Thus, a simple statement like “he speaks Hidatsa” can be
uttered assertively, emphatically, as an exclamation, or a simple neutral statement without any
attitudinal overtones.
Speech-act markers in Hidatsa can be divided into three categories of unequal size:
statements, commands, and questions. Each category contains a number of grammaticalized
speech acts identified by traditional grammatical labels, such as interrogative, declarative, and
imperative. The feature differentiating minor speech-act types from each other in each of the
three categories is the force of assertion. The statements category comprises the largest number
of grammaticalized speech acts, questions have three, and commands two. As Givón (1984: 318)
has pointed out, the “major well-coded speech-acts [i.e., statements, questions, and commands]
are just the most common, conventionalized (‘grammaticalized’) prototypes”. In reality, the
prototypes are distributed along a continuum space organized along a number of socialpsychological dimensions (Givón 1984: 318).
The three major types of speech acts and their realizations in Hidatsa are listed in TABLE
6.2.

independent clause, or may include relative, adverbial subordinate, or coordinated clauses.
Speech-act suffixes and evidential enclitics (see 6.2) are not necessarily sentence final since
other constituents of the sentence may follow the verb and the illocutionary suffix. Examples (1)

"894.2.2.1 Collective plural -aba
The collective plural suffix -aba is not used on the predicates of main clauses which are
pluralized with -ˀa and -ˀo. The distribution of the collective suffix is restricted to cosubordinate
clauses marked with -g (see 17.3), certain adverbial clauses (e.g., temporal clauses) and a few
adverbs. The collective suffix (1) disambiguates the grammatical number of the subject in the
non-matrix clause by marking it overtly as ‘plural’, and (2) views the individuals in question as a
group.
Examples (9a-b) demonstrate that independent clauses are unambiguous as to the
grammatical number of the subject. The default reading of the grammatical number in the nonmatrix clause in (9c) is singular, but the plural reading is also possible if context permits it. In
such cases the collective suffix -aba is used to eliminate ambiguity, especially if the number of
the subject needs clarification but is not apparent from the context. Example (9d) has an
unequivocally plural reading due to the presence of the collective marker.

The negative counterpart of the affirmative interjection éè yes, which cannot be usedpredicatively, is neehá no. Neehá is actually a stative verb that means ‘to not be something’.
When used as a response, the word may occur as both an interjection (neehá no) and a verb
(neehác it is not so).
The negative existential verb neesá to not exist can also be used as a response word. In
this function it can also occur both as an interjection (neesá no) and a verb (neesác there is no
such thing). The positive existential counterpart of neesá is madú to exist. It can only be used as
a verb (madúc there is such a thing) and never as an interjection (*madú yes).

there are numerous interjections whose use is restricted to ceremonial occasions and have, with a

files. In his field notes, Gilbert Wilson, too, refers to various vocalizations that were uttered by
specific groups of people on specific occasions. One of the few examples that he actually

The compromisive suffix -aci/-raci is a suffixal hedge that calls into question the appropriateness
of the verb concerned. It can be added to any predicate and is usually glossed as ‘kind of, sort of,
rather’. The compromisive suffix has two allomorphs: the ablaut-triggering suffix -aci after short
vowels and its non-ablaut causing allomorph -raci after long vowels (including diphthongs). The
contrast between the allomorphs is illustrated in (290a-b) with the two free variants of the verb
bxígi~bxigee to be squat as a person, be short and stubby:
(290) a. Bxígaacidoore. She is kind of short and squat. < bxígi + aci + doore ASSERT
b. Bxígeeracidoore. She is kind of short and stubby. < bxígee + raci + doore ASSERT
The excessive use of this downtoning suffix, which some speakers find distasteful, is
particularly associated with the Independence dialect, but it is extremely common in other
dialects as well.
Although compromisive expressions reach out towards the meaning encoded in the
predicate, at the same time they reduce the force of it. The speaker does not deny the information
conveyed by the predicate, but seems to do it in a deprecating and grudging way. Compromisive
and neutral statements are contrasted in (291) and (292).

Noun incorporation in some stems alternates between compounding and noun stripping
depending on the grammatical person of the inflected form. There are two patterns of alternation.
In the first type, illustrated with míàhxdee to be jealous in (291), the third person form in (291a)
occurs only as a compound, whereas the incorporated noun in the first and second person forms
may occur both as a stripped noun, as in (291b), or in a compound, as in (291c). The “stripped”
noun in (291b) is as a separate phonological word and the verb is inflected with an A-set prefix.
The compound in (291c) is inflected with a B-set prefix.
The second type of alternation is illustrated in (292). The stem Hiraaciréˀ to speak
Hidatsa occurs routinely as a compound in the third person, as in (292a), but the noun is always
stripped if the stem is inflected for the first or second person, as shown in (292b-c). In the second
type of noun incorporation the compounded third person form can also be broken up in slow,
enunciated speech, as shown in (292d). More examples of variation between compounding and
noun stripping are in TABLE 3.6.

In some respects noun stripping looks strikingly similar to the article-less NP described in
9.1. One question that needs to be answered by future research is whether the sequence of a
generic noun and verb is subject to any adjacency requirements.
Although it is unusual for an incorporated noun to occur in a coordinate construction, it is
possible with the verb ‘to speak something’. In (293), the two nouns, Aragaráhu Arikara and
Hiraacá Hidatsa, are linked with the coordination suffix -g that is added to the independent noun.","[228, 229, 230]"

Finally, the focus morpheme derives interrogative pronouns from D-words that are stativeverbs (see 12.1). D-words that are derived with -wa are used to ask questions about the nonergative arguments S and O. The ergative case marker -rí is suffixed to the same stem instead of wa if the question asked is about the ergative argument A. D-words with -wa may be used
370instead of ergative D-words if the argument structure of the clause is disambiguated by other
means, such as by marking the first or second person transitive object with the B-set pronominal
prefixes on the stem (see 5.1). The derivation of absolutive (S or O) and ergative (A)
interrogative pronouns is given in TABLE 9.1.

"2.2 Phonotactics
2.2.1 Syllable structure
The canonical form of the syllable in Hidatsa is CV(V). All lexical stems end in a vowel. Codas
are restricted to the lexical glottal stop, a small number of utterance final consonantal speech act
markers (see 6.1) and other clausal suffixes (see Chaper 17), codas formed by final vowel
deletion in commands (see 6.1.3.1), and the definite article -s.
29A word begins with either a single phonemic consonant or the phonetic glottal stop
preceding vowel-initial syllables. There are no word-initial clusters except for a small number of
lexemes that begin with a Ch cluster, as illustrated in (41). Other types of consonant clusters are
licensed only morpheme internally and at morpheme boundary.

éˀlong

his foodWord-final long vowels and diphthongs are usually shortened if the final syllable is open,
as is the case with máàhdii vehicle in (43) and gíˀria ride in (44). Since content words consisting
of a single light syllable are not grammatical in Hidatsa (unless the onset is a cluster), a phonetic
[h] is added to the end of a monosyllable in order to keep it heavy, as the three examples in (45).
However, there are monosyllabic words and grammatical morphemes, such as míà woman, múá
fish, and -hgua LOC, as well as final diphthongs in polysyllabic words, such as macúà sinew, that
are never shortened under any circumstances.","[52, 53]"
"12.1 Pronominal D-words
Three D- words, dabéè to be who, dáàba to be what, and agudóò to be which one are stative
verbs that in a matrix clause occur mostly, but not exclusively, in questions. They are also
extremely common in the dependent conditional and concessive clauses, in which case they
function as nonassertive indefinite pronouns.
Two types of interrogative pronouns are derived from pronominal D-words by suffixation.
When either dabéè, dáàba, or agudóò substitutes for a noun that is an absolutive clausal
argument (i.e., an Object in a transitive or a Subject in an intransitive clause), it is followed by
the focus marker -wa (see 9.4). 110 When any of the three pronoun substitutes for a noun that is an
ergative argument (i.e., an Agent in a transitive clause), it is usually followed by the ergative
110I am hesitant to call -wa an absolutive case marker although this is clearly the main function of this suffix when itfollows any of the interrogative pronouns. The same suffix can also be used emphatically with pronouns (see 11.2.2)
that can substitute for any argument of the verb, although the unambiguously ergative pronoun iirahéèri is by far
more common than íìwa in the emphatic agentive argument role. The focus suffix -wa is also found in dóòhseewa
why where it is clearly not an absolutive case marker.",[444]

"15.2 Adverbial affixes
The overwhelming majority of adverbs are derived from other lexical classes by means of
affixation and the number of such adverbs is huge. Among the affixes that derive adverbials are
468postpositional suffixes (see 16.1) and clause-final suffixes (see Chapter 17); however, the
description of adverbial derivation in this section is limited to affixes that are not discussed
elsewhere in the grammar.15.2.1 -haa ‘adverb’
The suffix -haa derives manner adverbs from verbs. Hidatsa manner adverbs typically answer
questions ‘how’ or ‘in what way’. In addition to prototypical manner adverbs, -haa also derives
multiplicative numerals, described separately in section 13.2.
With a few exceptions, the derivation of adverbs with -haa is subject to the same
phonological rules as the derivation of direct causative verbs with the causative suffix -hee (see
4.7.1) and locative adverbs with the path suffix -haa (see 16.1.4).
In most cases the final short vowel of the verbal base is deleted before the adverbial
suffix, as illustrated in (13). If the deleted short vowel is accented, the high pitch associated with
the deleted segment is left floating and imposed on the adverbial suffix, which acquires level
high pitch, as shown in (14). However, in a few lexically determined stems, such as cagí to be
good in (15), the final accented short vowel is never deleted and the adverbial suffix is added to
the unaltered stem.

without
by surpriseLong vowels and diphthongs are reduced to their first mora before the adverbial suffix
unless their second mora is accented. Again, the same rule applies to causative derivation (see
4.7.1) and the effects caused by the homophonous postpositional path suffix -haa (see 16.1.4).
An example of an adverb derived by suffixing -haa to a base with an unaccented second mora in
the final long vowel is in (18b). As expected, the long vowel has shortened. An example of an
adverb derived by suffixing -haa to a base with an accented second mora in the final long vowel
is in (19b). Because the second mora in migáá to be low is accented, it is not deleted.","[491, 492, 493]"
"Let’s look at both examples individually. Since the verb núùwiiri to circle around in (24)
occurs almost always in the causativized form núùwiidhee to circle around, the alternative
analysis in (24b) appears as plausible as the “correct” analysis in (25a). However, the first hint
that núùwiidhaa is indeed an adverb and not a clause comes from the fact the causative stem is
not inflected for first person. If núùwiidhaa were a continuative clause, one would expect to find
person agreement there. The same argument can be made for example (25) even though cacúgi to
be stiff and its causativized form cacúghee to stiffen something are equally common. According
to the description of contemporaneous clauses (see 17.5.1), both clauses are coindexed for the
same subject.
Examples (26a) and (26b) shed further light on the question. If Hiraaciréˀhaa in (26b)
were a causative verb in a contemporaneous clause it would mean ‘to make sb speak Hidatsa’.
According to the causative analysis the correct interpretation that the second person is
commanded to say something in Hidatsa would be impossible. Also, if ‘to speak Hidatsa’ were a
clause, the two clauses would have to be coindexed for the subject and ‘to speak’ would be
inflected for person; compare it, for example, to the coordinative clause in (26a) where the
agreement requirement is met. In the final analysis (26a) consists of two clauses, which literally
mean “speak in Hidatsa and say it”, whereas (26b) is a single clause (imperative of ‘to say sth’)
accompanied by an adverbial adjunct “in Hidatsa”.

473The final argument against the interpretation that the hitherto described adverbials are
causativized continuative stems (stems causativized with -hee and followed by the
phonologically empty yet ablaut triggering clause final morpheme Ø CONT) is provided by a few
irregular verb stems that have clearly separate adverbial and causative forms. For example,
sagásghi to be crooked in (27a) is adverbialized irregularly by suffixing -haa to the final short
vowel that remains undeleted, as shown in (27b). The direct causative form of sagásghi is formed
regularly by deleting the final short vowel and suffixing the direct causative marker -hee to the
preceding stem, as shown in (27c).
(27)a. sagásghi be crookedb. sagásghihaa in a zigzagc. gisagásghee become crooked15.2.2 -hcii ‘X by X’
This suffix indicates that the action occurs in discrete stages. This suffix is not common and the
semantics and derivation require further documentation. The basic meaning of -hcii is illustrated
in (28) and (29). It appears that -hcii means either ‘X by X’, as in ‘little by little’ in (28), or ‘X of
Y’, as in ‘little of everything’ in (29).

When -hahgá indicates an estimation or approximation, as in (273), the irrealis marker
aru- does not co-occur with an abilitative stem. Hahgá in such constructions can be glossed as

combining -hahgá and the adverbial suffix -haa, realized as -hagháà, which will be described in
detail in 15.2.6.

The possibilitive construction -gug hirí(hi) expresses epistemic possibility and may be glossed as
‘maybe’ or ‘might’. The construction is composed of an unaccented clause-final suffix -gug and
the auxiliary verb hirí (lit. to do sth) that is inflected for person and number in the future tense
(see 6.5.2). 6868Hirí to do sth, make sth is an irregular verb. The present and past inflected forms are hiríc he did it, mahéèc I did it,and náheec you did it. Inflected future forms and their literal meanings are hiríhic he will do it, mahéèwic I will do it,

"14.2 Exclamatory phrases
Exclamatory phrases are nonsentences formed with lexemes that have an independent semantic
value. They are classified as exclamations because they always occur without illocutionary
markers (see 6.1) and do not enter into syntactic relations. A question mark in (25), for instance,
suggests an interrogative speech-act, but the absence of the interrogative speech-act marker -ˀ
indicates that the utterance is actually an exclamation.
(25)Harúg
níg / níhgi(i)?

and.then 2-PRO
How about you?!
The communicative value of exclamatory phrases is identical to interjections, i.e., theyexpress emotions and have a conventionalized emotive value when used as exclamations.
However, because of the inherent lexical meaning encoded in them, they do not belong to the
lexical category of semantically empty interjections.
The following are examples of exclamatory phrases:458•

The seed for this grammar was planted in the winter of 2006 after I had returned to
Bloomington from an unsuccessful trip to many different reservations in the Plains to locate a
language for my dissertation research. Just as I was giving up hope, Raymond J. DeMallie
suggested to Douglas R. Parks that I work on Hidatsa. A few months later, I was able to
accompany Doug on an unrelated trip to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, where he had
worked for more than thirty-five years documenting the Arikara language. Since Doug has a
larger-than-life reputation on Fort Berthold, I could not have found anyone more qualified to
introduce me to the community. Besides Doug’s reputation, the serendipitous similarity between
our last names, and the fact that we are both at Indiana University has opened many doors for me
on Fort Berthold and probably left behind a number of confused individuals.
The most important person to whom Doug introduced me was Rosaria Starr, one of the
most fluent Hidatsa speakers on the reservation. Rosie had worked on language projects in the
past both with Doug and a fellow Siouanist, A. Wesley Jones, and she graciously agreed to
collaborate with me on the Hidatsa documentation project, one of the byproducts of which is the
present grammar of Hidatsa.
On the same trip Doug introduced me to another very special person for Hidatsa studies,
A. Wesley Jones, who gave generous support for my documentation project, including an
unexpected jump start. Wes had worked on Hidatsa in the 1970s and 80s. Trusting Doug’s
recommendation, he not only agreed to grant me access to all of his field materials but also to
deposit them in the archives of the American Indian Studies Research Institute at Indiana
University. During my numerous trips through Bismarck to or from Fort Berthold, Wes and his
wife Jenny have always been wonderful hosts and great company.
ivThanks to the A. Wesley Jones collection I was able to connect in unexpected ways to
several other linguists who have worked on Hidatsa in past. In 1988, Florence Voegelin entrusted
Wes with the bulk of her own field materials as well as those of her late husband Carl Voegelin
and his colleague Zellig Harris. Wes collated most of their lexical files with his own. I am
gratified to know that this important and rich collection, which was originally compiled in
Bloomington and then Bismarck, after a twenty-year sojourn in North Dakota has found its way
back to Indiana. I am proud that my own field materials, both the field notes and sound
recordings, have become a part of this historical collection, which has continually grown in size
and quality after it was first begun at Indiana University more than sixty years ago.
I could not have completed this dissertation without the advice from my committee,
chaired by Douglas Parks and Robert Botne, and including Ray DeMallie, Paul Kroeber, and
Stuart Davis, whose comments on the draft versions of individual chapters contributed
generously to the development of my ideas. As a non-native speaker of English, I often found it
more difficult to deal with my English prose than with the Hidatsa data, which I stand by without
reservation as it was recorded verbatim from the best speakers of the language.
Douglas Parks and Robert Botne in particular went to great lengths to help me improve
the readability of the English sections of the dissertation. Doug and I work in the same building,
and consequently he was usually the first person I went to with questions. Much of my
understanding of language typology, morphology, and related phenomena comes from Robert
Botne, from whom I took four courses, all of which I consider among the most insightful,
interesting, and instructive during my years of study in the Linguistics Department.
Whenever I received back a draft chapter from Paul Kroeber, it was always followed up
by a lengthy discussion in which Paul, drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of languagevtypology and his familiarity with the Crow language, led me time and again to alternative paths
of analysis. Paul’s ability to detect inconsistencies and contradictions, even if they were
hundreds of pages apart, never ceased to amaze me.
Thanks to my minor advisor, Ray DeMallie, I was always mindful of the fact that
language is a social institution first and a formal system second; I hope that this insight from
anthropology is reflected in the final version of this grammar, exemplified particularly in the
section on kinship, where I discuss some parallels between social and grammatical structures.
A special note of appreciation goes to Stuart Davis, who was not only my pre-dissertation
advisor in the linguistics department but also played a decisive role in bringing me to IU. Stuart
was often the first person to comment on my preliminary ideas, even before they became
chapters, by giving me valuable feedback on my annual presentations at the Linguistic Society of
America meetings.
My greatest thanks go to the Hidatsa people who welcomed me into their homes and
communities, and who honored me and my wife by formally adopting us into the Knife clan.
First and foremost, this grammar would not have been possible without the fulltime commitment
by my most important collaborators, Rosaria Starr and Arvella White, who spent countless hours
patiently answering my questions, expanding paradigms, and translating texts. This work is as
much theirs as it is mine. I would also like to thank all the other Hidatsa speakers who
participated in this project, especially, Fred Gunn, Carol-Ann Newman, Bryan Brady, and
Louann Phelan, and countless others who willingly shared their time and knowledge with me.
Work on the present grammar was conducted under the aegis of the Three Affiliated
Tribes Tribal Council in the hope of contributing to the preservation of the Hidatsa language. I
would like to express my particular gratitude to Bernadine Young Bird, Susan Paulson, ConnieviWhite Bear, Mark Bluestone, Quincee Baker, and Malcolm Wolf, all of whom provided me with
institutional support.
The successful completion of this project was made possible by support from the Hans
Rausing Endangered Languages Project in London, the American Philosophical Society, the
New Town School District, and the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation.
Finally, I thank you, Sayon, my beloved wife, friend, and partner in all my quests. Your
encouragement, support, quiet patience, and unwavering love over the past five years were
undeniably the bedrock upon which this dissertation has been built.viiINDREK PARK
A GRAMMAR OF HIDATSAThis dissertation is a comprehensive description of the grammar of Hidatsa, a Siouan language
spoken by approximately 100 people on the Forth Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota.
The grammar begins with a description of the historical and linguistic background of
Hidatsa and an overview of previous scholarship. It then proceeds to a description of Hidatsa
phonology, derivational and inflectional morphology, lexical categories, and concludes with a
chapter on clausal phenomena.
The phonemic inventory comprises ten consonants, five vowels, and two diphthongs.
Vowel length is contrastive. There is no lexical stress; instead, Hidatsa has developed a pitchaccent system that involves contrast between high and low pitch, contrast between level and
falling pitch contours on long vowels and diphthongs, underlying accent on most morphemes,
and variation on the surface level of accent placement caused by various derivational and
inflectional patterns.
The canonical sentence structure is agent-object-verb, also characterized by postpositions,
head marking, and internally-headed relative clauses.
Hidatsa employs two systems of morpho-syntactic alignment that distinguish between the
arguments of transitive and intransitive verbs. The two core arguments of transitive verbs, agent
and object, and the single core argument of intransitive verbs, subject, are marked by (1)
pronominal prefixes on verbs (split-intransitive alignment) and (2) suffixes on noun phrases
(ergative alignment). Overtly expressed clausal arguments are also disambiguated by their
relative ranking on the animacy and agentivity scales.
viiiHidatsa morphology is agglutinative and involves considerable prefixation and
suffixation. Participant information and modal categories are encoded on the verb by affixation.
Hidatsa has developed a typologically unusual evidential system and an elaborate system of
obligatory speech-act suffixes. Both deverbal nominalization and compounding are highly
productive. There is also limited noun incorporation. Other Siouan characteristics include
classification by posture verbs, perspective by motion verbs, and alienable and inalienable
possession.
The grammar is written within the framework of Basic Linguistic Theory. Data used were
obtained through elicitation from Hidatsa speakers and analysis of spontaneous speech. This
study disproves several widely held notions about Hidatsa, clarifies various outstanding issues,
and identifies various hitherto unknown features in the language.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"
"4.9 Reciprocity
The concept of reciprocity is expressed with the quasi-pronominal prefix magi- each other. The
reciprocal magi- precedes all other prefixes in the verb, including pronominal prefixes, as in
(209), with the exception of B-set pronominals, as in (210), and the third person plural object
prefix maa-, as in (229). Reciprocal verbs are usually inflected for the plural. In serial verb
constructions it is the last element in the chain that is marked for the plural, as in (211) and (212).

The reciprocal prefix freely combines with all types of predicatives, but the prototypical
reciprocal construction is closely related to the concept of transitivity. Intransitive verbs are
typically transitivized, either by causativization or prefixation (as with the portative aˀg- or the
confrontive aˀ-), before the reciprocal prefix is added to the verb. The expression “it takes two to
tango” nicely characterizes the semantics of reciprocity: many such verbs, as illustrated in (213),
involve activities by two (or more) participants directed at each other, often involving love life or
conflict.

One could argue that the examples in (106) and (107) have both a subject and an object.
As for transitive verbs that are first reflexivized with -ria and then causativized there is no
question that they can have an outside argument. For example, the stem in (108), based on the
transitive verb úàˀhdi to laugh at somebody, is inflected with an A-set pronominal prefix as well
as an indirect causative suffix. The direct object, as the gloss implies, lies outside the verb
complex. The outside argument (mii- me) is explicit in (109).

There are data in Harris and Voegelin’s lexical files about the use of a rare reflexive
causative morpheme -ihgee in Hidatsa. My own consultants were uncertain that constructions
with the reflexive causative morpheme are grammatical and suggested that one use the
contemporary sequence of the reflexive suffix -ria and the indirect causative suffix. The
historical reflexive causative morpheme does, however, survive in Hidatsa society and dance
names, such as Míìraaˀihgee Goose Society, Maaˀiháàwiaˀihgee Enemy Woman Society, and
141gíìrabiˀihgee [pretending to be] buffalo dance. (110) and (111) are examples of this morpheme,
inflected for person and number, as they appear in Harris and Voegelin’s lexical files.

"4.8.3 GI-verbs with lexicalized meaning
The meaning of many hgi-initial verbs has become lexicalized and is no longer predictable.
However, the semantic contribution of GI to the idiomatic meaning of such verbs is typically still
transparent and always involves iterative, repeated, or vertitive activities. A representative list of
verbs with their respective GI-forms (some of which are causativized) that have an idiosyncratic
meaning is presented in TABLE 4.53.

A number of stems, presented in (200), do not occur without hgi- synchronically. The semantic

cases it seems to contribute little or nothing to the meaning of the verb.

Florence Robinett (1955a: 164) pointed out that hgi- may occur in different slots in the stem. It
may precede the pronominal prefix, follow it, or occur in both positions simultaneously. It can
occur more than once in a single stem only if the two prefixes are separated from each other by
one or more other prefixes or an incorporated noun, therefore third person forms with two
contiguous hgi-s are not possible.","[200, 201]"
"When nuwa some is used in its primary function as a quantifier, it appears after the noun
it modifies, as in (52a). It can also be used pronominally to substitute for a noun, as in (52b), in
which case it is prefixed to the verb.
