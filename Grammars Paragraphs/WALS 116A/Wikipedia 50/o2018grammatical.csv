9.6.2WH questions
Although word order in Kamsá is quite free, question words are always at the start of theclause when WH questions are formed. The only words that can precede question word are
adverbs. Subjects, objects, and verbs always come after the question word. The remaining230constituents of the clause can be in any word order. Figure 9.1 shows the question words in
Kamsá.

Figure 9.1 Question words
The following examples are all WH questions. In each one, the clause starts with the WHword. (21a) shows ndayá ‘what’ in three questions, where it is the object. (21b) and (21c) show
nda ‘who’ in intransitive questions. (21d) and (21e) show ndmoy ‘to where’ in intransitive
sentences. In (21d) the subject is not realized, whereas in (21e) it is and the verb is the last word
in the question. (21f) and (21g) both have questions with ndayek ‘why’ and have different word
orders: in (21f) it is verb then subject and in (21g) there is no verb. In (21i) the question word
ndëmwanÿe modifies boyabasa ‘man’.

"The word being compared is marked with the benefactive -am for inanimate nouns and -byam for
animate nouns. Comparatives for phrases are similarly formed with mas and the phrase. There
are no irregular comparatives; all comparatives are formed with mas + adjective. One interesting
phenomenon, however, is that for better sometimes the language uses mas + ts̈aba ‘good’ and
sometimes mas + mejor. Similarly, worse is often mas + peor. Superlatives are formed with mas
and the adjective. The noun has no special marking.
In (15a) the adjective bna ‘tall’ is preceded by mas and tobias̈ ‘girl’ is marked with the
benefactive byam, while bobonts ‘young man’ is not marked. In (15b) wamaná ‘above’ is
preceded by mas and bwatëmbaya ‘teacher’ is marked with the benefactive biam. In the second
part of (15b) wamaná ‘above’ is preceded by mas and ndwiñ ‘owner’ (from Spanish dueño) is
marked with benefactive -byam. In (15c), there is a phrase being compared, obenana bomná226‘power-having’. In all examples, mas precedes the adjective. In (15d) más ‘more’ and ts̈abá
‘good’ mean ‘better’.

9.5Imperatives
There are two types of imperatives in Kamsá: morphological imperatives with m- andfuture as imperative.
9.5.1Morphological imperatives
Imperatives are formed with m- before the verb root. There is no other morphology. In(18a) jabo ‘come’ has m- as does j-olempia ‘clean’ (from Spanish limpiar ‘clean’) in (18b).

9.5.2Future as imperative
Another common way to make a command is by using the future. In (19a) the verb j-areparan ‘watch’ is marked with the second singular marker ko- followed by the future prefix228ch- as in (19b) with jatbana ‘collect’. (19c) is repeated from above and shows both strategies of
command: the morphological imperative mo-lempia ‘Clean!’ and the future as imperative with
kochjase ‘Eat!’.

9.6Interrogatives
Word order in Kamsa is very free. Yes/no questions can have any word order. WHquestions, however, generally have the question word first with other constituents following the
question word. Adverbs can precede the question word. Sometimes the evidentiality is different
with only j- and not n-, the marker for things the speaker has seen or experienced. The verb
jamnan ‘be’ often has the prefix yo- in questions, but I have not determined the use of this prefix.
9.6.1Yes/no
Yes/no questions can have any order. They often end with the tag aiñe o ndoñ ‘yes orno?’ In (20a) the clause is verb final, whereas in (20b) the main verb jan ‘go’ is first with the
complement jenokwedam ‘eat together’ and the deictic ‘to there’ following it. In (20c) the verb
jan ‘go’ shows different morphology than the usual affirmative tonja for the third singular past.
Also, the question ends with the tag aiñe o ndoñ. In (20d) the word order is OSV and the
question ends with the particle ka. (20e) shows a longer yes/no question with an embedded
clause.","[239, 240, 241, 242]"
"261.6.1Phonetics and phonology
Kamsá’s phonemic inventory is average for languages. There are 19 consonant phonemesand 6 vowel phonemes. The consonant inventory is marked by its large number of sibilants (both
fricatives and affricates). Also, the language has many consonant clusters. The series of voiced
stops /b, nd, ng/ is unusual, where /b/ is not prenasalized phonetically but the other two are.
There are a few phonemes that are borrowed from Spanish, including /d/, /g/, /ʎ/ and /r/,
although the language had the two prenasalized stops previously.
1.6.2Morphology and word classes
Kamsá has complex morphology and is polysynthetic. There are prefixes and suffixes,but not infixes or circumfixes. Verbs are primarily prefixing. Nouns and adjectives primarily
have suffixes. But verbs also bear suffixes, and all parts of speech can have certain suffixes.
Nouns and adjectives can have prefixes, as well.
Verbs have prefixes for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality, emphasis, and
more, and have a few suffixes for TAM and nominalization. Kamsá verbs have morphological
marking distinguishing singular, plural, and dual. There is a distinction between present, recent
past, distant past, and future. There’s a two-way system of evidential marking. Negation is
shown with a negator and verbal prefixes; the verb has several options for prefixes. There are a
few clitics, as well, including subordinators.
Nouns have suffixes. These suffixes show number, case, class, and more. Noun class
markers are part of the noun; the noun cannot appear without its class marker. Cases can stack,
i.e. a noun can bear multiple case markers. Nouns can also appear with postpositions, but they do
not have to. Case markers may be clitics or may be suffixes. Nouns can be singular, plural, or
dual, shown by suffixes, but number marking on nouns is not obligatory.
1.6.3Word order and syntax
The basic order of basic constituents in Kamsá seems to be SOV but it is extremelyflexible and is also perhaps becoming SVO under the influence of Spanish. Kamsá is dependent-27marking, with possessors being marked morphologically rather than the thing possessed. The
language also exhibits agreement, with adjectives agreeing with nouns in class, number, and
sometimes case. Oblique phrases tend to follow the subject of the clause and can precede or
follow the verb. Negators almost always precede verbs. Kamsá has mostly postpositions,
although it also has some prepositions that it has borrowed from Spanish. There are some
subordinators that are clause-initial and others that are clause final. In possessive constructions,
the possessor precedes the possessum (possessed) and is marked with a genitive case ending.
Adjectives can either follow or precede the nouns that they modify. Demonstratives and
numerals always precede nouns. Kamsá may be considered a pro-drop language, in that an overt
subject is not a necessary syntactic element.
Kamsá has nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment. In the third person, S and
A (not O) trigger verbal agreement. There can be also object marking on verbs, mainly for first
and second person objects. When the verb is ditransitive, if the goal is first or second person, it is
marked on the verb (not the theme). Kamsá has a strange characteristic of having dual marking
when there is a transitive sentence with an animate agent and patient. This could be polysemy.
There is wh-movement for questions: question words always come at the beginning of the
clause. Polar (‘yes/no’) questions do not necessitate any change in word order, and no special
particle is needed, although the tag aiñ o ndoñ ‘yes or no’ is commonly added to the end of the
question with a difference in intonation. Comparatives and superlatives are formed with the
Spanish loanword más ‘more’. Both nouns and adjectives can function as predicate
complements, either without a copula or with an inflected ‘be’ verb.
1.6.4Kamsá compared with Andean languages
Adelaar (2008) states that it “has been a common practice among linguists working onSouth American languages to make an intuitive distinction between ‘Amazonian’ and ‘Andean’
languages on the assumption that there would be two different language types corresponding to
these labels.” He proposes many traits that Andean languages tend to have (and many traits that
Andean languages lack). Here I discuss 20 of the traits that he suggests and explore whether
Kamsá fits or does not fit the typological expectations of this proposed Sprachbund. These areal
features are often tendencies.","[39, 40, 41]"
"250bo-ch-jáma
DU-FUT-do10.3.5 Causal clauses
To encode the cause of an event or state as a dependent clause, there are two options in
Kamsá: either the subordinator kaus ‘because’ (which is clause-final) or the subordinator porke
‘because’ (which is clause-initial) may be used. Both are loan words from Spanish: kaus
‘because’ derives from causa ‘cause’ and porke ‘because’ derives from porque ‘because’.
Whereas porke has the same grammatical function as its Spanish equivalent, kaus has a different
grammatical function: it is a subordinator in Kamsá (as opposed to a noun, as is its Spanish
equivalent).
10.3.5.1 The subordinator kaus ‘because’
The subordinator kaus, which can also be kausa or kausna, may be used to show the
cause of an event or state. In (18a), kausa comes at the very end of the clause, after the verb. The
verb is fully inflected for person and number. In (18b), it is at the end of a clause, with the verb
being inflected and marked as a subjunctive. In (18c), it also comes at the end of a clause. For
comparison, (18d) shows kausa as a postposition which follows an NP, creating the phrase
‘because of the wind’. Postpositions are discussed in 8.4. It is possible that the subordinator kaus
is clause final because of its use as a postposition.

10.3.5.2 The subordinator porke ‘because’
The subordinating conjunction porke ‘because’ from Spanish porque ‘because’ is
common in Kamsá. It is used to connect clauses, always occurring as the first element of the
subordinate clause, as in (20). The ‘because’ clause seems always to be the second clause.

Note that -ka is also the translative marker as well as one form of the instrumental marker
-ak.)10.4Indirect speech
Indirect speech is encoded in Kamsá with a verb of speaking, followed by the thing beingtold (without any subordinators). Some common verbs used for introducing indirect discourse
are:
j-ayanan ‘say’
j-auyanan ‘say’
j-atjayan ‘ask’252j-ojwan ‘answer’
j-aparlan ‘tell’
j-akwentan ‘tell’
j-obwambayan ‘say, declare’
The following two examples show the verbs jojwan ‘answer’ and jatjayan ‘ask’, each
having an object of the VP: in (21a) kanÿe palabra ‘one word’ and in (21b) kanÿe soy ‘one
thing’.

When the one being told or asked something is first or second person, this participant is
marked in the object marking slot of the verb. In (22), the verb j-awentan ‘tell’ is marked with
the first person object marker s̈o-. s̈o- is the marker for first person objects in transitive
sentences or the goal in ditransitive sentences.

Kamsá word shien ‘rat’ is used. bwenoka from Spanish bueno ‘good’ with clitic ka)
With the verbs jayanan ‘say’ or jauyanan ‘say’, the person hearing (if designated) is
marked with a allative suffix. The word order is flexible: the hearer can come before the verb, as
seen in (24a), or after the verb, as seen in (24b).

102:15) (j-olempia from Spanish limpiar ‘clean’)Chindoy lists two forms: j-auyan ‘say to someone’ and j-ayan ‘say’. It is not clear whether the u in the second
form is morphological or lexical.
31254There are a few strategies for encoding reported speech discussed in the following
sections.
10.4.1 Paratactic reported speech
One strategy for encoding reported speech is to have the verb of speaking followed by
that which is said, without any subordinators or other indicators that two clauses are being
linked. In (25a), the verb j-ayana ‘say’ is followed by the clause detailing that which is said.

10.4.2 Reported speech using subordinators
Reported speech can be encoded with the subordinator nts̈amo ‘how’, as well as with
other question words. In (26a) the reported speech is shown with nts̈amo ‘how’ followed by the
verb j-apasan ‘happen’. In (26b) the reported speech is also shown with nts̈amo but the verb is
an infinitive. In (26c) there are two clauses of reported speech. nts̈amo is also discussed in 10.3
on subordination and 9.6.2 on questions.

‘Castilian’.)
10.4.3 Indirect questions (embedded questions)
Indirect questions are formed with the question word followed by the verb. The verb
often has the evidential marker j- that indicates unknown. The comparison can be shown
between (27a) and (27b) where the verb j-amnan ‘be’ in (27a) is marked with the unkown
evidential marker j- in the indirect question and in (27b) is marked with n-, the known evidential
marker, for the response.","[263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269]"

7.5Negators
There are two main negators in Kamsá: ndoñ and tonday. They are also discussed insection 9.3 on negation. ndoñ means ‘no’ and can precede words: verbs, nouns, adjectives as
well as be the answer to a yes/no question. Generally, ndoñ precedes the thing it is negating, as
seen in (39a) in which it precedes a verb; in (39b) in which it precedes an NP; (39c) in which it
precedes chka ‘in this way’; (39d) in which it precedes mas ‘more’; and in (39e) in which it
precedes and adjective: ts̈aba ‘good’.

Although ndoñ generally precedes words it is negating, it can follow them, as well. This seems to
add more emphasis. In (40a) ndoñ follows wabwanán ‘cooked’, and in (40b) ndoñ follows mas
‘more’ to mean ‘no more’ (or ‘more, no’).

Another negator is tonday. It precedes the noun it is negating. (41a) tonday negates

waskwats̈ijwa ‘tail’. I have found no examples of clauses with both ndoñ and tonday.","[198, 199, 200]"

As seen in the table above, subordinate clauses that formed with ch ‘that’, or the question
words nts̈amo ‘how’, ndayents̈ ‘where’, nda ‘who’, or ndayá ’what’ always begin with the
subordinator, whereas in temporal subordinate clauses with ora ‘when’ or in causal subordinate
clauses with kaus ‘because’, the subordinator comes at the end of its clause. Furthermore,
subordinate clauses with ch, nts̈amo, and question words tend to follow the main clause, whereas
temporal and causal subordinate clauses can either follow or precede the main clause.
10.3.1 Subordinate clauses with nts̈amo ‘how, what happened’
A common subordinator is nts̈amo ‘how’, which (in such constructions) is used much like
the English word ‘what’. To see how nts̈amo is used in questions, see 9.6.2. In (7a), nts̈amo
‘how’ subordinates the clause ‘horrible [things] happened’ to the main clause ‘the older brother
… returned to see’. In (7b), nts̈amo ‘how’ is used for ‘how it happened’. In (7c), it is in a
subordinate clause following the main verb montsetats̈ëmbo ‘they (didn’t) know’ with an242infinitive j-tsenojwanan ‘get rid of’. The verb in this subordinate clause j-tsenojwanan ‘get rid
of’ is not inflected.

Thus, while nts̈amo ‘how’ is a question word and—as such—functions much like theother question words that an act as subordinators (11.3.3), it is treated separately here since it
fills a number of roles and expresses a number of meanings not seen with the other question
words.","[254, 255, 256]"
"24310.3.2 Subordinate clauses with other question words
In addition to nts̈amo ‘how’, other question words can be used to form subordinate
clauses. These include nda ‘who’, ndayents̈ ‘where’, ndayek ‘why’, and ndaya ‘what’. These
subordinators are identical in form to their respective interrogatives (9.6.2). They always come at
the beginning of the clause. (8) shows a sentence with several subordinate clauses, including the
question words ndayek ‘why’, ndayents̈ ‘where’, and nda ‘who’, and nts̈amo ‘how’.

The following sentence (9) provides an example of several subordinate clauses, including
a number of question words. The main verb j-obwambay ‘tell, advise’ is inflected for third
singular distant past. Each of the following subordinate clauses starts with a question word. In
the first two (with ndayents̈ ‘where’ and ndayá ‘what’), the verb is marked with bi-, which is
perhaps a subjunctive marker. In the third subordinate clause, nts̈amo is followed by the
infinitive j-oshacheñán ‘find’. The fourth subordinate clause is really two clauses, ‘what would
happen/how it would happen’ and ‘when they collect (the) gold’. The first begins with nts̈amo
244‘how’ and the verb is inflected; the second (which is actually itself embedded within the first—
that is, it is subordinated to the subordinate clause beginning with nts̈amo ‘how’) ends with the
temporal subordinator ora ‘when’ (see 11.3.4).

from Spanish chorro ‘gushing water, water jet’ )
10.3.2.1Subordinate clauses with ndayá ‘what’The question word ndayá ‘what’ is used to form subordinate clauses, especially in
indirect discourse or indirect questions. (10a) is repeated from (6) above and shows a subordinate
clause that starts with ndayá ‘what’. (10b) has ndaya-m. It is not clear why ndaya ‘what’ has the
benefactive marker -m in this example but it is possible that it is required for complements of
certain verbs. In (10c), ndayá ‘what’ is used together with the noun pago ‘payment’.

10.3.2.2Subordinate clauses with ndayents̈ ‘where’The question word ndayents̈ ‘where’ is used to form subordinate clauses as well. In (11a),
it is used to form a subordinate clause meaning ‘where the cathedral is now’. In (11b), it is
negated by the negator ndoka to mean ‘there is nowhere…’, perhaps an existential matrix clause
with null copula: “(there was) not [where he could be]” In (11c), the people are talking about
where to shoot the hawk who has been hunting their chickens and they say to aim for ‘where he
breathes’.

10.3.3 Temporal subordinate clauses with ora ‘when’
Temporal clauses may use the subordinator ora ‘when’, which derives from Spanish hora
‘hour, time, term’. Unlike the question words discussed in the previous sections (which come at
the beginning of the clause), the subordinator ora comes at the end of the clause. In (13a), ora is
the final element of the subordinate clause ‘when the field-owner didn’t see her’. In (13b), this
word comes at the end of the clause ‘when the deer was tired’. Sometimes the forms or, gor, or
orna may be used instead of ora (note orna in 13b, gor in 13c and 13d). (13d) shows a
simultaneous action in the past. Temporal clauses with ora can either precede the main clause (as
in 13a, 13b, and 13c) or follow the main clause (as in 13d); the order is flexible.

10.3.4 Subordinate clauses with =as
A common strategy for subordinate clauses is employing the clitic =as, which comes at
the end of the subordinate clause. It tends to attach to the verb, but it can attach to the end of the
VP. It is possibly a clause level clitic, related to the word as ‘then’ which may derive from
Spanish así ‘thus, therefore, so, like that, in this way’. The word as, however, comes at the
beginning of clauses, whereas the clitic =as comes at the end of the clause. Semantically, =as
seems to be like the Greek participle where one does not know if it is causal, concessive,
temporal, etc. It can be used for past, present and future.
In (14a) =as is on the verb j-apasan ‘happen’ (which can also mean ‘be’) and has a
causal meaning. In (14b), =as is on j-obobekon ‘get close’ for a temporal meaning, for two
things happening simultaneously. In (14c) it is on j-obebi-an ‘bathe’ for a temporal meaning, as
well. In (14d) it is on the verb j-atersi-an ‘drape’ and has a temporal meaning. In (14e) it is on
two verbs before the main verb j-atsënts̈e ‘push’. In (14f) the adversative clause has the
subordinator =as in kondbomnas ‘you having’. It is strange in that it uses pero, or that pero can
be used redundantly with =as.

The subordinator =as does not necessarily immediately follow a verb; rather, it attachesto the end of a verb phrase (which may end with something other than a verb). In (16), the
subordinator =as cliticizes to the end of the VP, immediately following the oblique phrase
plechufjw-ak ‘with (an) arrow’, following the instrumental suffix -ak. Here, =as seems to have
adversative force (‘but rather’). Given that it is following the oblique, it seems to be a phrase
level clitic rather than a phrasal clitic.

There are a few words in the language in which ɨ occurs word-initially, namely somethird person singular verb forms. The third singular present form of ‘be’ is ɨndɨmɨn ‘he/she/it is’.
This is perhaps a reduction of the vowel i- which is the most common third singular verbal
prefix.
2.2.1.4 Arguments against the high central vowel as a phoneme
An alternative analysis is that ɨ is not phonemic, but instead is either an epenthetic vowel
(to break up consonant clusters) or a reduced form of an underlyingly different vowel.
Sometimes (and especially between nasals), it is not clear whether [ɨ] is present in the word at all
(even phonetically). Thus [mɨnte] ‘today’ could also be realized as [mnte], that is, with a syllabic
nasal and [ɨndɨmɨn] ‘he/she’it is’ could also be [ndmn], [ndɨmɨn] or other various combinations
of having the high central vowel and not having it.
Although there are arguments against ɨ being phonemic, I claim here that it is a phoneme
because of the few minimal pairs and because speakers distinguish between it and other sounds.
2.2.1.5 Vowel-glide sequences and glide-vowel sequences
There are no diphthongs in Kamsá, in that it is never the case that multiple vowels form
the nucleus of a syllable. There are, however, two possible sequences of vowel-plus-glide in
Kamsá (/aj/ and /oj/), as well as four possible sequences of glide-plus-vowel (/je/, /jo/, /ja/, and
/wa/). The vowel-plus-glide sequences both contain the palatal glide /j/ as their coda; the glideplus-vowel sequences can begin with either the palatal glide /j/ or the labio-velar glide /w/,
39although there are limitations on which vowels may form the nucleus of the syllable. Kamsá
syllable structure forbids vowel sequences: any vowel sequences that could potentially occur are
broken up by the insertion of a glide.
/aj/
The sequence /aj/ has wide distribution. It can be at the beginning of a word, as in ajnan ‘heart’;
it can be at the end of a word, as in wafxaxonaj ‘lagoon’; and it can be somewhere in the middle
of a word (with a consonant forming the onset of the syllable), as in tajta ‘father’.
/oj/
The sequence /oj/ is also common. It can be at the beginning of a word, as in ojena ‘inhabitant’;
it can be at the end of a word, as in tabanoj ‘to(ward) the town’; and it can be somewhere in the
middle of a word (with a consonant forming the onset of the syllable), as in soj ‘thing’ or boja
‘man’.
/jV/
Glides can also form the onset (or part of the onset of a syllable. The palatal glide /j/ can occur
before three vowels: /e/, /a/, and /o/. That is, it may precede non-high vowels (*ji, *jɨ, *ju are not
attested). There can also be word initial onsets with j- followed by a vowel, such as the distant
past marker je-.
je: betje ‘tree’
ja: atʂbjam ‘for me’
jo: atʂbjoka ‘at my place’
joj: atʂbjoj ‘to me’
/wa/
The labio-velar glide /w/ can also precede a vowel, although it has a much more restricted
distribution: /w/ can only precede the low vowel /a/. There is no /w/ without a following vowel,
but /w/ can be word initial as seen in the word waben ‘sister of a man’.
ʃbwaya ‘hunter’
ʃekwatʂ ‘foot’
40waben ‘sister of a man’
In sum, there are four phonemic vowels in Kamsa that have wide distribution and that
contrast with one another (/u/, /e/, /o/, and /a)/. There are also two vowels whose phonemic status
is questioned, as their occurrence is predictable accept for minor exceptions (/ɨ/ and /i/). There
are several vowel-glide and glide-vowel sequences, but vowel sequences are prohibited.
2.2.2Consonants

First, I would like to thank all of the Kamsás who welcomed me into their lives: Carmen,
without whom nothing would have been possible; Margarita, Clemencia, Anita, and Maria
Clementina for teaching me their language; Alejandro for all the wonderful conversations about
language, philosophy, and life; as well as Margarita, Andrés, Ivan, Miguel, Luis, Sandra, and
Rosita.
I have been extremely lucky to have worked with Lyle Campbell, who is the best advisor
anyone could ever hope for. I would also like to thank my committee members, William
O’Grady, Gary Holton, Bob Blust, and Alex Mawyer; and Robert Littman, who was the reason I
was able to do a graduate degree at the University of Hawai‘i.
My friends in Bogotá offered me incredible support. I would like to thank Pipe for
dedicating his time to working with me on Kamsá; Gustavo, whose conversations kept me going;
Jennifer for always being willing to accompany me into the jungle; Andrea, one of the most
lovely people in the world; Andrés for the evenings in La Candelaria; Edinson for our lunches
together; Daniel for being my bodyguard; Francisco and Gloria for their hospitality; Lili for
being my Colombian mother and friend; Javier for the inspiration; David for the breaks from el
centro; Leidy for sharing insights about Kamsá; Camilo for being wonderful; Jorge for our
mornings in Juan Valdez; Paul for the walks in the rain; Laura and Rajiv … I don’t know where
to begin; Gerriet for always helping; Arturo for becoming my friend at BBC; Ricardo for our
time together; Fernando for helping me before I knew Spanish; Mauricio for making things a
little more fun; Alejandro and Juan for giving me a home; Yinneth for her great knowledge; Katy
for the chats over coffee; and Youlin for helping me before she even knew me. There have been
many other people in Colombia whom I’m grateful to as well: Luisa for opening her home to me;
Henry in Sibundoy; Gloria in Manizales.
Some friends from the US visited me during my time in Colombia, making my time there
even more pleasant. I’d like to thank John for making the first trip to Sibundoy with me; Ariane
for staying in touch … hopefully we see each other more; Noah, these years have been crazy;
Erik for always being there to talk and helping edit more drafts of things than I can count;
Joachim for being willing to do anything; Craig for being a great friend and going with me to the
beach.
Other friends who’ve been supportive during my degree, some of whom I’ve known
since elementary school, some I’ve met more recently: Don, Vlad, Laura, Jonathan, and Verna.
I’d also like to thank my parents.
Other mentors who have guided me during my PhD include Bryan, without whom I may
never have done academia; Caleb for always seeming to believe in me; Thiago for offering
advice along the way in Colombia; and Brett for the advice and contacts, starting in Cambridge.
I’d like to thank friends and classmates in Hawai‘i who’ve helped in various ways
throughout the PhD process: Eve, Kirsten, Samantha, Kavon, John, Ryan, Sejung, Victoria,
George, Laura, Clara, Kevin, Adila, and Melody.
I am also grateful for the generous agencies that have helped fund my research including
the Bilinski Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the American Association of
University Women, and the Foundation for Endangered Languages.
Finally, I’d like to thank Russell.iiABSTRACT
This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangered
language isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.iiiTABLE OF CONTENTSACKNOWLEDGMENTS .................................................................................................. ii

Introduction
1.1Summary
This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangeredlanguage isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.
This introductory chapter to this dissertation is organized as follows:
In 1.2, I discuss the Kamsá people and language, including the location, culture, relationship to
other languages, borrowing, and the name of the language. In 1.3 I discuss the language ecology
and language vitality, and in 1.4 I discuss previous research on the language. In 1.5 I describe my
methodology, and in 1.6 I give a typological overview of the language.
1.2The Kamsá people and language
Kamsá [ISO 639-3 kbh, Glottocode cams1241] is an endangered language isolate spokenby fewer than 500 people in southern Colombia. According to ONIC (Organizacion Nacional
Indigena de Colombia, ‘National Indigenous Organization of Colombia’), the Kamsá population
is 4,773 (onic.org). Although attempts have been made to find relationships to other language
families such as the Chichban family, none has been successful (see 1.4.2). The Kamsá people
have shared the Sibundoy Valley with the Inga people (who are speakers of a Quechuan
language) for over 500 years, and they share many cultural similarities such as the important1carnival holiday, their use of yagé (ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic concoction), and their blue and
red wool ponchos.
1.2.1Location and history
The homeland of the Kamsá people lies in the Sibundoy Valley, a relatively high plateauat about 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) above sea level, surrounded by higher mountains. The
population is centered around the municipality of Sibundoy, the GPS coordinates of which are
1°12’N, 76°55’W (1.20, -76.92). The municipality lies about half-way between the cities of
Pasto and Mocoa in the northwest corner of the Putumayo department of Colombia. The region
serves as a passageway between the lowlands and the highlands and for this reason has long been
important for the migration of people (Ramírez de Jara & Pinzón Castaño 1992:288). The
municipality of Sibundoy is composed of four different towns: Sibundoy, Santiago, San
Francisco, and Colόn, The Kamsá language area also extends somewhat into two neighboring
corregimientos (population centers below the level of municipality): San Pedro and San Andrés.
The largest concentration of ethnic Kamsá is found within the town of Sibundoy proper and its
surrounding veredas (rural areas outside a city or town), but there are also some Kamsá in the
small town of San Francisco.
Map 1 (on the following page) shows where Sibundoy is within Colombia. Pasto is to the
west, and Mocoa to the east.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"

person singular distant past: ye-. The difference between the distant past with i- and the distant
past with ye- is as yet undetermined and is discussed further in 4.4.7). Finally, when a transitive
verb has a third person singular subject and a first or second person (singular, plural, or dual)
object, the subject is not marked; only the object is marked. Phonetically, the i- for third person
singular habitual is often reduced to [ë].
In (6a) and (6b), the tense/aspect of the verb is present/habitual and the subject is a third
person singular referent. In (6a), the subject is cha, the third person singular pronoun. In (6b), the
subject is kes̈ ‘dog’, In (6c), the verb j-wabwan ‘cook’ has the future marker chan- with the third
person singular marker i- preceding chan- and indexing a third person singular (pronominal)
subject.

to-. In (8a) j-wabw-an ‘cook’ has the prefix to-, agreeing with the third person singular pronoun
cha. In (8b) the verb jonÿnan ‘be born’ has the prefix ton-, agreeing with the singular subject
s̈es̈onatem ‘baby’. For comparison, (8c) shows a verb with the completive marker to- but without
the evidential marker n-. An alternative analysis is that t- could be the past or completive marker
and that third person singular is zero-marked. This analysis is problematic, however, because tdoes not appear for the past in other persons or numbers, except very rarely.

1PL-BENThere are three ways in which first person plural subjects may be indexed (or partially
indexed) on verbs. The first option is to use the verbal prefix bsë-, which encodes both first
person and plural number. The second option is to use the first person prefix së-, which marks
only that the subject is first person, without indicating its number. The third option is to use the
plural marker mo-, which marks only that the subject is plural, without indicating its person.
Without an expressed subject or context there would be no way to tell if a verb with mo- is first
second or third person; the only thing that is apparent is that it is plural. Similarly, if there is no
other context or pronoun, së- is definitely first person, but could be singular, plural, or dual. The
prefix bsë-, on the other hand, is specifically first person plural.","[105, 106, 107, 108]"

castellano ‘Castilian’, rala < Spanish real ‘real [unit of currency]’ and j-en-trok-am
‘exchange’, presumably from Spanish)The -na on the end of verbs is probably a different -na than the topic marker =na on NPs. It is possibly -an and -a.
More research is needed, however.
9117In addition to these two suffixes found on nonfinite verbs, there are a number of suffixes
found on finite verbs in Kamsá, namely: -as, -ye, -an, -a, -na -ents̈ (?), and -ok.
Evidentiality is treated separately in 4.5.
4.4.1Aspect: non-past habitual nd- and non-past progressive tsThe aspect markers nd- and ts- come after the person and number markers, and also afterthe evidential markers, if there are evidential markers. Thus, they are the inflectional prefixes
closest to the verb root. (Footnote: derivational prefixes can occur between these inflectional
prefixes and the root) nd- and ts- precede the verbal root. Often, epenthetic vowel /ë / is added
after the aspect marker, before the verb root. This seems to be phonological or phonetic rather
than morphological. Neither nd- nor ts- is obligatory; verbs can be marked without aspect. ndmarks habitual in the present or future, and ts- marks a progressive action in the past or future.
Note that there is homophony between the habitual prefix nd- and negative prefix nd-.
They have different functions, and appear in different slots. The negative prefix nd is discussed
in 4.9.3.
In (40a-b), ts- shows actions that are currently happening: cooking and changing. ts- is
between the evidentiality marker n- and the verb root in both examples. (40c-f) show nd- for
habitual actions and states. In (40c) and (40d), nd- shows a constant state, being able to sing,
having a house, and usually waiting. In (40c), the verb is also ongoing, non-completed. Thus, ndcould also be interpreted as non-completive.

Other than a few Spanish missionaries who wrote word lists in the 18 th century, there wasno attempt made at devising an orthography for Kamsá until the 1970s, when SIL linguists first
arrived in the Sibundoy Valley. Since then, several people have been writing the language,
including anthropologists, Kamsá community members, and other researchers. Although most of
the orthographic symbols are the same across the board, the orthographies do differ on the
following sounds (in IPA): /x/, /ʂ/, /tʂ/, /ɨ/, and /ⁿdʒ/. There is also variation in how people write
the vowel-plus-glide sequence /oj/ (either <oi> or <oy>) and debate as to whether there is
(underlyingly) a labial-velar approximant in the language or whether this sound is more properly
a high back rounded vowel—that is, people differ on whether to use <w> or <u> to transcribe the
bilabial approximant.
The first person to really propose an orthography of Kamsá was Linda Howard (1967;
1977), a missionary linguist from SIL (her work is discussed further in Section 1.4). She based
her orthography on her phonemic analysis of the language and proposed more or less what I have
written above. That said, as many SIL researchers have done in Latin America, she followed
Spanish conventions, such that /k/ is spelled <qu> before /i, e/, but is spelled <c> elsewhere. The
main differences between her orthography and mine are that she writes the voiceless velar stop
as <qu> or <c> rather than <k>, the retroflex fricative as <x> rather than <s̈>, and the retroflex
affricate as <tx> rather than <ts̈>. This use of <x> may be confusing to those familiar with the
IPA, since <x> (in the IPA) is used to transcribe the voiceless velar fricative and some Kamsá
writers have used <x> as the voiceless velar fricative (Jamioy Muchavisoy 1992, 1999).
McDowell (2014) follows Howard in her orthography except for a couple of
modifications. He uses <k> throughout for the voiceless velar stop (as do I). He does not use
<ë>, or any other symbol for IPA [ɨ], at all, arguing that this vowel is not phonemic but is
predictable based on its environment, namely that it is inserted when there are consonant clusters
or nasals. For example, McDowell generally transcribes the third person plural pronoun, which
phonetically is closest to [tʃɨᵑɡa], as <chnga> (p.106) or, sometimes, as <chunga> (p.228),
whereas most Kamsá authors write <chënga>, using the symbol <ë> to transcribe the high
central vowel. With other words, he transcribes [ɨ] as <u> or <e>. Like Howard, he uses <x> for
the retroflex fricative. For the prenasalized voiced palato-alveolar affricate (IPA /ⁿdʒ/), he writes50<ny>, claiming that it is an allophone of /y/, perhaps a nasal preceding an allophone of /y/. He
transcribes the labio-velar glide /w/ as <w>, even when it follows another consonant, whereas
others transcribe it as <u> in such environments (e.g., he writes <twamba> ‘hen’ as compared to
others’ <tuamba>). Finally, he writes the vowel-plus-glide sequence /oj/ as <oy>, whereas some
writers prefer <oi>.
The divergences from the IPA that are shared by most transcriptions (including my own)
are as follows: 1) superscripts are not employed for prenasalized segments (e.g., <nd> for / nd/),

2.7.2 Justifications for my orthography
<p, b, f>
/b/ seems to be phonemic with [f] as an allophone (namely in consonant clusters when it
precedes voiceless consonants) and [p] as another allophone (in word final positions). I have51decided to write these sounds with three separate symbols (i.e., as <b>,<p>, and <f>) for two
reasons. First, I believe it will be more useful to people when they are reading the language to
see the surface realization of underlying /b/. Second, it is the case that these phones are different
phonemically among loan words from Spanish. When there is some free variation (mainly
between [b] and [f]), I write the sound as <b>, sometimes with a note.
<ë> (ɨ)
The high central vowel is problematic for several reasons. First, it is difficult to determine
whether it is actually a phoneme, because—for most (but not all) words—it is phonologically
predictable. Second, it is often inserted as an epenthetic vowel between consonants, particularly
nasals. These issues are discussed in greater depth above on the phonology of the language. The
third difficulty is the question of how to write this vowel. Most authors have chosen <ë>, so I am
following the literature by using that symbol. McDowell (2014) does not write it at all; instead,
when he believes it to be epenthetic, he excludes it completely and when he believes it to be
underlying /u/ or /e/, he writes it as <u> or <e> accordingly.
<w, y>
Glides: I have decided to write <w> although many Kamsa writers use <u>.
Problems with using <x>
I have chosen not to use <x> as a symbol in my orthography, neither for the voiceless
retroflex fricative /ʂ/ nor for the voiceless velar fricative /x/, because it has been used by several
authors (McDowell 1994, Howard 1967) for the retroflex consonants, so that if I were to use it to
symbolize the voiceless velar fricative, as in IPA, it would be confused by native speakers who
have seen it written for retroflex consonants. Excluding <x> from my orthography will avoid
some confusion. Following the conventions of many Kamsá writers and the Kamsá cabildo
‘governing body’, I use <s̈> to transcribe the voiceless retroflex fricative /ʂ/ and <ts̈> to
transcribed the voiceless retroflex affricate /tʂ/. Following Spanish orthography (and all Kamsá
orthographies), I use <j> to transcribe the voiceless velar fricative /x/.","[62, 63, 64, 65]"

Sentences and multi-clausal constructions
10.1Introduction
In this chapter I examine Kamsá sentences that are composed of more than one clause (inaddition to considering the coordination of multiple elements within a single clause). Two (or
more) clauses may be combined in Kamsá, either through coordination or through subordination.
When two clauses are coordinated, they maintain an equal grammatical status. A subordinate
clause, on the other hand, is dependent upon another (main) clause. Both coordination and
subordination can be signalled (in part) through the use of a class of words called conjunctions.
First I discuss coordination (10.2), including conjunctive coordination (10.2.1),
disjunctive coordination (10.2.2), adversative coordination (10.2.3), and correlatives (10.2.4). In
(10.3) I discuss subordination strategies, and (10.4) is dedicated to indirect discourse.
Kamsá has several conjunctions, including both coordinators and subordinators. Many of
the coordinators, which can connect words or phrases as well as entire clauses, are derived from
Spanish. Figure 10.1 shows the most commonly used conjunctions in Kamsá, providing basic
glosses and etymologies (where known).

Figure 10.1 Conjunctions
The following sections provide illustrations of clause combinations. First, coordination isconsidered, both at the phrase level and at the clause level (10.2). Then I examine how
subordination works in Kamsá (10.3).
10.2Coordination
Coordination is typically signaled by the placement of a conjunction (coordinator)between the constituents being connected. The following sections discuss three types of
coordination in Kamsá: conjunctive (‘and’) coordination (10.2.1), disjunctive (‘or’) coordination
(10.2.2), and adversative (‘but’) coordination (10.2.3). All three coordinating conjunctions in
Kamsá are loans from Spanish; there are no known indigenous coordinators.
10.2.1 Conjunctive coordination
Conjunctive coordination is shown with the conjunction i ‘and’, which has been
borrowed from Spanish y ‘and’. When the conjunction i ‘and’ is placed between two elements,
the two are joined syntactically, with neither element receiving special status or grammatical235marking. When two or more NPs are obliques, they can all have the oblique marker (seen in 1f)
or sometimes only the second NP will have the oblique marker.
The conjunction i ‘and’ can be used to connect phrases within a clause as well as to
connect clauses within a sentence. In (1a), it connects two NPs, each consisting of a single
common noun: boyabasetemënga ‘boys’ and shembasetemënga ‘girls’. In (1b), the conjunction i
‘and’ connects natjëmban ‘peace’ and silentsio ‘silence’, two NPs used adverbially. In (1c), it
connects two VPs: s̈kotabe ‘I pull it out for you’ and kbochjwebuts̈en ‘I’ll throw it to you’. In
(1d), two clauses are connected: akna benchetema ‘you (are) small’ and ats̈na bëtsá ‘I (am) big’.
there is no verb, however, because the copula can be dropped. In (1e) two clauses are connected.
In (1f) there is coordination between NPs that are marked for case, with the benefactive -am.

‘Prepare spots for the people from Popayán, Pasto and Bogotá, and those from the hot

As seen in (1a), the conjunction i ‘and’ may be used, in a sense, to add an NP participant
to a clause. Another means of accomplishing this is with the preposition parej ‘together with’.
Unlike i ‘and’, the word parej ‘together with’ does not conjoin two NPs equally; rather, the
second element is marked with either the instrumental suffix -ak for inanimate nouns or the
comitative suffix -byak for animate ones. Although this isn’t a conjunction (it’s a preposition) it
semantically achieves a similar thing.
Thus, although clearly derived from the Spanish noun parejo ‘equal (to)’, ‘equivalent
(with)’, ‘on a par with’, ‘at the same level (with)’, ‘even’, ‘identical’, the Kamsá word parej
‘together with’ functions as a preposition. In (2a), parej is used twice. In the first instance, it
connects chnungwan te ‘six days’ with ibet ‘night’, meaning ‘six days and (six) nights’; the
second instance functions similarly to express the notion of ‘three days and nights’. In (2b), the
first element of the coordination is not expressed (it is understood to be the 3PL pronoun chëng
‘they’); only the element after parej is overt: the object of the preposition enuta ‘friend’.

Disjunctive coordination in Kamsá is signaled by either the conjunction o ‘or’ (in positive
polarity) or by the conjunction ni ‘neither, nor’ (in negative polarity). Both words are
transparently loans from Spanish.
Like the conjunctive coordinator i ‘and’, the disjunctive coordinator o ‘or’ can be used to
join two phrases, as in (3a), where it occurs between the numerals unga ‘three’ and kanta ‘four’.
In (3b), the conjunction o ‘or’ joins two NPs (place names), Tëtknaiyay and Chitjianëjay. Note
that only the second place has the locative suffix/clitic. In (3c), it connects two VPs : jojandwon-áy-an ‘roll around’ and j-en-obwast-an ‘scratch oneself’.

161:11)The word kabëng (the first plural pronoun with the intensifier ka-) is used to refer to indigenous people, often
Kamsás and Ingas, as opposed to other people. One can say someone is ‘kabëng’ to mean that he or she is
Kamsá/Inga” but you wouldn’t use ka-bëng to talk about you and your friends to do something, unless you’re
emphasizing that the group is indigenous. Thus, this sentence means the priest found the indigenous people there.
28238In negative polarity, the disjunctive coordinator ni ‘nor’ from Spanish ni ‘neither, nor, not
even’ is used. It can be between NPs (nouns and pronouns) as seen in (4a) in which it is between
three nouns, and in (4b) between two nouns. It can also be used to connect VPs, as in (4c). In
addition to appearing between conjoined elements, ni ‘nor’ may also (as in Spanish usage) occur
before the first element as well. In such instances (as in 4a), it is means neither … nor.

10.2.3 Adversative coordination
The adversative coordinator pero ‘but’ is also a Spanish word. Although it may connect
elements within a single clause (as in 5d), it most commonly conjoins two main clauses. As such,
it appears between two clauses. In (5a) it introduces a new clause. In (5b) pero also introduces a
new clause, and the word nÿe is also used. As discussed further in 10.2.4 nÿe ‘just, only’ also has
a correlative function. In (5c) pero creates a contrast.

Kamsá has several strategies for connecting a dependent clause to a main clause—that is,for marking subordination. Most often, subordinate clauses are indicated by free words
(subordinating conjunctions or subordinators) that occur at the beginning of the subordinate
clause. Alternatively, a few such subordinators occur at the end of their respective subordinating
clause. There is also one subordinating clitic, =as, that appears at the end of the subordinate
clause.
Figure 10.2 (on the following page) lists the major Kamsá subordinators, providing basic
glosses and indicating where in the clause they are located—that is, whether at the beginning or
at the end of the subordinate clause.","[245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]"

When a noun is plural, the class marker comes before the plural marker. In (26) shemnëbe ‘egg’ has the class marker -be and is followed by -ng to show it is plural. Note that the plural
marker is not obligatory; shemnë-be could be plural without -ng.

McDowell states that noun class markers (which he terms noun classifiers) can be addedto words that do not necessarily have them as a way to be creative with the language (1994). He
gives the following example. In (27), from one of McDowell’s texts, the determiner ch refers to
the oso ‘bear’ mentioned before in the same line. The determiner ch has the noun class marker be which is used for round things. According to McDowell, this means he is being referred to as
a round person, and that he is a humorous oaf rather than a fierce suitor that bears are in other
stories.

‘And as for that bear, he put (them) on the fire.’ (From McDowell 2014:220)
I have not found any productivity with noun class in my data. McDowell gives oneexample of this occurring, and it is with -be. Whether or not other class markers could be used
productively is unknown. If it is true, however, then these noun class markers perhaps seem more
like noun classifiers than markers of noun classes.
3.3Other nominal morphology
Kamsá nouns can have derivational morphology, though it is very limited, mainly tonominalize verbs, and also evaluatives including diminutive, pejorative, and augmentative. There
is also considerable inflectional morphology, for number and cases. This section discusses the
morphology of nouns, including noun cases, number markers, and diminutives. Noun class66markers were discussed above (see 3.2). Some of the morphology was discussed in Chapter 3,
but here it is discussed in more detail, including all of the morphemes and allomorphs and their
uses and meanings.
3.3.1 Number
Kamsá nouns have suffixes for number and nouns can be singular, dual, or plural.
Singular nouns have no overt marking, whereas dual and plural marking is shown by a suffix on
the noun. Number marking is not obligatory in Kamsá, and often plural and dual nouns are left
optionally in their singular form, especially when it is clear from the context that the noun is
plural or dual.
The suffixes are summarized in Figure 3.2.

consonantSingularØbata ‘aunt’shlofts̈ ‘bird’Dual-atbata-t ‘two aunts’shlofts̈-at ‘two birds’Plural-(ë)ngbata-ng ‘aunts’shlofts̈-ëng ‘birds’Figure 3.2 Nominal number
In the following example, kes̈ 'dog' is kes̈-at in the dual and kes̈-ëng in the plural. Because
batá ‘aunt’ has a final stressed vowel which cannot be deleted (as in other words that have final
stressed vowels, but unlike words that have optional final vowels; see Chapter 2 on the
phonology). When batá is dual, batá + at becomes batát. When batá is plural, batá + ëng
becomes batáng.
(kanÿe) kes̈ ‘one dog’
(uta) kes̈-at ‘two dogs’
(unga) kes̈-ëng ‘three dogs’
(kanÿe) batá ‘one aunt’
(uta) bata-t ‘two aunts’
(unga) bata-ng ‘three aunts’67Nouns that end in -n become -ng in the plural as seen below, where s̈es̈on ‘baby’ becomes
s̈es̈ong. and begon ‘fish’ becomes begong in the plural. Thus the n → Ø /__+ng ?
s̈es̈on ‘baby’
s̈es̈ong ‘babies’
begon ‘fish’
begong ‘fish (pl)’
The evidence that these are suffixes rather than separate words or clitics can be seen with
nouns that undergo a phonological change when the plural or dual marker is added, as seen
above with nouns that end in vowels, such as bata ‘aunt’ which is batang in the plural, ‘aunts’.
Also, nouns that end in -n undergo a phonological change when the plural marker is added, as
seen where the plural of begon ‘fish’ is begong ‘fish (pl)’ The second piece of evidence that
these are suffixes rather than separate words is that psychologically speakers think that they are
part of the word based on questions I have asked consultants. Finally, -at and -ng never stand on
their own.
In Kamsá, the dual and plural markers are optional. In (28), three options for marking
dual can be seen. In (28a), the uta viajerata 'two travelers' has both the numeral two and a dual
suffix, -at. In (28b), viajerata has the dual suffix but not numeral. In (28c), the noun tjok
‘mountain’ is modified by uta 'two' but has no dual marker. In (28d), the ungrammatical example
shows that plural cannot be used for dual. Note that (28c) has the determiner ch to mark
definiteness/specificity whereas (28a) and (28b) do not.

Similarly, plural nouns can be marked with both a number and a plural marker (29a),
without a number and only a plural marker (29b), with a number without a plural marker (29c),
and without a number and without a plural marker (29d), where the context makes it clear that
the noun is plural. Note that (29d) could be singular, plural, or dual; context is needed to
determine which it is.

3.3.2Evaluatives: diminutive, pejorative, and ‘poor’
There are three evaluatives in Kamsá and they are used as suffixes on the noun andsometimes the adjective agree with the noun. There is a diminutive -tem, a pejorative -ëfja with
allomorphs -ëja and -ëfa, and a suffix for ‘poor’ -jema.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"
"904.2.1 First person singular: së- and ØVerbs with first person singular subjects are marked with the prefix së- in the present
progressive, habitual, and past. They are unmarked (or marked with the null marker Ø-) in the
future. There is one small class of verbs where first person singular is te- in the past.
In the following sentences, the first person pronominal agreement prefix on the verb is
së-, shown with different tense/aspect marking. In (1a) and (1b) the verbs j-wabw-an ‘cook’ and
j-wam-an ‘know’ are habitual. The verbs j-wabw-an ‘cook’ and j-otebem ‘sit’ are present
progressive in (1c-d). The verb j-wabw-an ‘cook’ and j-achemb ‘call’ are past in (1e-f). In some
of the examples (1a, 1b, 1c, and 1e), the first person singular pronoun ats̈ is used, but it is not
obligatory (and not included in 1d or 1f), because the prefix së- shows that the subject of the verb
is first person singular.

8.3Verb phrases
A verb phrase in Kamsá consists minimally of a verb (8.3.1), but can, alternatively,consist of a verb and its direct object (8.3.2), a verb and an oblique object (8.3.3), a verb and two
objects (ditransitive verbal constructions) (8.3.4), a verb, a direct object, and an oblique object
(8.3.5), a verb and an adverb (8.3.6), and a verb and a verbal complement (8.3.7), among other
possible combinations. Some (semantically) transitive verbs have within their argument structure
an object marked with an oblique case (8.3.8). There are also other possible pairings not
discussed here.","[215, 216]"

10.5Causative constructions
Causatives are formed morphologically. They are formed by adding the object pronounprefix to the verb. A causative meaning is formed by putting an object pronoun marker on the
verb, thus, increasing valency, going from ‘she cried’ vs. ‘she cried me’ = increase valency of
‘cry’ by 1, meaning it now takes a direct object, and therefore, since ‘cry’ is semantically
inherently intransitive, with the object the sense is a verb with both a subject and an object,
hence causative. As far as I know, there is no analytic version, i.e. no multiword construction
like ‘make someone do something’ composed of some independent ‘make’-like auxiliary or verb
plus another verb. In (28a) there is an intransitive sentence with the verb j-os̈achn ‘cry’. It is
marked with to- to show past and third singular subject. In causative (28b) j-os̈achn ‘cry’is
marked with the direct object pronominal prefix s̈o-. In (28c) the verb is marked with the dual
bo-. In (28d) only the first person subject is marked with te-, an alternate past form for the first
person singular. The function of j- is unclear. In (28c) the bo- shows that there is an animate
subject and an animate object, while in (28d) the verbal prefix (28d) just marks first person
singular subject and past tense. In (28e-f) a causative with a transitive verb jasan ‘eat’ is shown.","[269, 270]"

4.3.14 Other phenomena associated with object marking
One interesting phenomenon in the Kamsa language is that when a verb is ditransitive,
the pronominal agreement morpheme that is attached to the verb indexes the goal. In (37), the
goal is first singular and is shown on the verb with s̈o-. Furthermore, the first person pronoun ats̈
is in the sentence with no marking.

"The sections on pronouns include some notes on the semantics of the pronouns, a brief
discussion of the alignment, the basics of case marking on pronouns, and the use of the
intensifier and evaluatives on pronouns. The lack of reciprocal pronouns is discussed. Finally, I
present my attempt at analyzing indefinite pronouns. This chapter discusses independent
pronouns, not bound pronominal marking on verbs, which is discussed in Chapter 4.
5.2Independent pronouns
Kamsá has nine personal pronouns for subject/object. As with nouns, there is nomorphological difference for pronouns that would depend on whether they function as the
subject of an intransitive sentence, the subject of a transitive sentence, or a direct object. They
mostly behave as nouns do in the language. They take case markers, and sometimes evaluatives.
Like nouns, they do not seem to take class markers when they are referring to a noun with class
markers. this section does not discuss pronominal affixes (e.g. pronominal agreement markers on
verbs). Kamsá is a prodrop language. Person and number is marked by agreement affixes on the
verb, both for subjects and objects, and the pronoun is not necessary.
5.2.1Personal pronouns
The pronouns for first person have the same root for dual and plural, bë- with ng forplural (like the plural marker on nouns and adjectives) and -ndat for the dual: bëndat ‘we (two)
and bëng ‘we (more than two)’. Similarly, the second person pronouns have the same root tsë in
the plural and dual, with -at for the dual and -ng for the plural. There is a second form of second
person plural: tsëngaftang. The pronouns for third person all have the same root, with the
singular having a vowel -a, and the dual and plural having -at and -ëng, respectively. The third136person dual pronoun has another form chëndat. The third person pronoun likely comes from
determiner ch. Note that for first and second person, the singular pronoun is unrelated to the
plural and dual. Figure 5.1 shows the personal pronouns.

"52no <c> or <q>
To simplify the orthography, I use <k> for all voiceless velar stops. I do not use <c> in
the orthography except as part of the digraph <ch> for the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /tʃ/.
Some authors have used <c> (at least in some lexemes) for the voiceless velar stop, presumably
based on English usage. Thus Howard (1967) wrote the name of the language as “Camsa”. .
Some authors have used <qu> for some Kamsá words to transcribe the velar stop while using
<k> for transcribing the same sound elsewhere. I do not use <q> at all in my orthography.
<s̈> for retroflex
The retroflex has been written with a variety of symbols. One problem with using <s̈> is
that it could be confused with /ʃ/ or other sounds. The alternatives, however, seem more
complicated. No one in the community uses IPA <ʂ>, and some researchers have used <x> for
the retroflex, which could be confused with other sounds.
<ll>
There is perhaps a phoneme /ʎ/, the palatal lateral approximant as discussed in 2.2.2.7.
The sound is extremely rare, but there are a few words where it exists, such as mallajt (IPA
maʎaxta) ‘many’. I use <ll> for this sound because every Kamsá speaker also speaks Spanish,
where the sound [ʎ] is written <ll> and it is easier than using the IPA [ʎ].
<nd> for /nd/
I use <nd> instead of <d> for /nd/ for two reasons. First, I want to show the
prenasalization in the orthography. Second, I want to be able to distinguish between older loan
words that were borrowed as / nd/ from Spanish /d/ and newer ones that are borrowed as /d/.
Finally, to conclude this chapter, I offer one last note about the phonology. Although
words can end in consonants, the vowel /a/, often reduced to [ɨ], is often added to the end of
words. It does not seem to be grammatical. It can only be added to consonant final words. Words
that end in stressed /a/ cannot lose that /a/. In this dissertation, I gloss this added /a/ as EPE for
epenthetic.","[65, 66]"
"21Some community members have noticed that the language is not being passed on to
children, and they have various reactions to this, ranging from desire to take action to feeling that
no action is necessary, since the children will still somehow have the language because it is “in
their blood”, to feeling futility, that the language will be lost no matter what, since children are
concerned more with popular music than with the language of their elders. Many people,
however, have not noticed how dire the situation is, perhaps in part because many children do
indeed know the basic greetings and some vocabulary, and so can often come across as more
engaged with the language than they actually are. Él/ella) entiende ‘(s)he understands’ is a
common thing said about members of the younger generation.
1.3.4Education
The Kamsá have many resources at their disposal for linguistic and cultural preservationand have begun several projects to maintain their language. These include a series of bilingual
schools in Sibundoy, a Kamsá preschool in Bogotá, language and culture classes in the cabildo,
an app for phones, a radio station, many websites, and books.
Sibundoy has its own bilingual school system, called the Sibundoy Institución
Etnoeducativa Rural Bilingüe Artesanal Kamentsá ‘Sibundoy ethno-educational rural, bilingual,
artisanal Kamsá Institution’, run by Kamsá community members and consisting of a preschool,
elementary school, and high school. Thus a child can, in principle, attend the bilingual school for
the entirety of his or her education. Any child can attend, whether ethnically Kamsá or not. I
have not been inside the school myself, but according to people in the community, most of the
instruction is in Spanish with some lessons about Kamsá culture and some instruction of
vocabulary. Thus, these are not bilingual schools according to the classical definition that
demands that there be instruction using two languages as teaching languages in subjects other
than the languages themselves. Rather, the Kamsá school focuses more on culture, having
cultural workshops where children can learn to make traditional Kamsá items, such as bracelets,
but additionally has some Kamsá language classes (not unlike foreign language instruction in
many schools in Colombia and elsewhere).
There was a thesis project done in 2016 by Agreda España, a pedagogy student at the
Universidad Distrital in Bogotá, to implement knowledge of the traditional Kamsá garden into22the daily school system at the bilingual high school. The school seems interested in continuing
projects that connect the students with the traditional community and in the future may start a
documentation project where the students record elders speaking Kamsá as a way to engage them
while at the same time recording knowledge before it may be lost.
In Bogotá, there is a preschool for children called the Casa de Pensamiento Shinÿak
(literally ‘House of Shinÿak Thought’). It is one of several preschools for indigenous children in
Colombia’s capital, and, like the school in Sibundoy, it is open to all.
There are also educational apps. A group of Kamsá university students has been
collaborating to make Kamsá language learning apps. The first of these apps, Juatsjinÿam
Kamentsá ‘Practicing Kamsá’ was released in November of 2017. Its purpose is to help children
learn vocabulary, particularly related to the garden, clothing terms, and colors. The cabildo in
Sibundoy sometimes offers language classes for community members. Anyone can attend these
classes, and they can be used to supplement classes from the bilingual schools.
1.3.5The future of Kamsá
Because most of the parent generation are not competent speakers and are not passing thelanguage on to their children, it seems that the language will be lost unless a great effort is made
to revitalize it now. Much of the infrastructure is in place: the bilingual school, written materials,
and strong social presence of the cabildo. But community effort is necessary for today’s children
to learn the language and pass it on to their children. My feeling is that grandparents would need
to start teaching Kamsá to the children in the community now, maybe following a language nest
model, or the language will mostly be gone in 20 or 30 years.
1.4Previous research on the language
This dissertation is the first reference grammar of Kamsá. In this section I describe thehistory of research on the language and the major earlier contributions. There have been five
major contributors to the documentation and description of Kamsá. Much has been published
about the culture of the people and certain aspects of the language, and there are many Kamsá23texts that have been translated into Spanish and/or English, but there has not yet been a full
grammatical description.
First, there was Marcelino de Castellví (1908-1951), a Capuchin priest from Spain, who
founded the Centro de Investigaciones Lingüísticas y Etnológicas de la Amazonia Colombiana
(‘Center for Linguistic and Ethnological Research in the Colombian Amazon’, CILEAC). He
wrote several articles about Kamsá including “Bibliografía de la familia lingüística Kamsá”
(‘Bibliography of the Kamsá linguistic family’) (1940).
Second, Linda Howard, a linguist working for the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL),
spent a number of years living in Sibundoy. SIL was present in the region for almost 30 years,
but with very few publications. Howard published two articles in English and two in Spanish on
the language in the late 1960s: a brief description of the phonology “Camsá phonology” (Howard
1967) and an attempt at explaining verbal inflection from a tagmemic analysis, a theoretical
framework used by SIL linguists in the 1970s: “Camsá: certain features of verb inflection as
related to paragraph types” (Howard 1977).
Third, in the early 1990s, John McDowell, a folklorist at the University of Indiana,
published So wise were our elders: Mythic narratives of the Kamsá (McDowell 1994), a book of
traditional stories in Kamsá, all translated into English, with extensive commentary. Although an
impressive book and an excellent record of traditional culture, its purpose was not to describe the
morphology or syntax of the language, nor is there any interlinear glossing. He has also written
several articles including “Collaborative Ethnopoetics: The View from the Sibundoy Valley”,
“Discourse Authority in the Sibundoy Valley” (1995), and “The Community-building Mission of
Kamsá Ritual Language” (1990), among others.
Fourth, in the 1990s, José Narciso Jamioy Muchavisoy, a Kamsá linguist, published a
few articles about the language after completing his Masters in Ethnolinguistics at the
Universidad de los Andes in 1989. Some of his articles are: “Tiempo, aspecto y modo en
kamentsa” (‘tense, aspect, and mood in Kamsá’, 1992), “Estructuras predicativas del kamentsa”
(‘predicative structures of Kamsá’, 1999) and “Observaciones a los documentos de Fray
Marcelino de Castellví sobre la lengua Kamëntsá” (‘Observations on the documents of Father
Marcelino de Castellví about the Kamsá language’, 1999). In addition to these articles, he also
helped translate Colombia’s constitution of 1991 into Kamsá.","[34, 35, 36, 37]"
"2038.3.1VPs consisting entirely of a single verb
A verb phrase can consist of just a verb (without any other constituents) as seen in (20a),where the verb jwenatjëmban ‘disappear’ is marked for person, number, and TAM. The prefix
tën- ‘3SG’ indexes the third person singular subject washëntsayá ‘sower’. There is no object,
oblique, adverb, or postposition within the VP. In (20a), the verb phrase contains nothing but a
verb, and the object of the verb that is not present as a full noun is indicated by a crossreferencing prefix on the verb (k- ‘2SG)’. The prefix b- (which follows the object marker) indexes
a first person singular subject; and the prefix at- marks the mood of the verb as irrealis.

8.3.2VPs with a direct object
Verb phrases can have expressed direct objects. As there is no case marking on anynominals (including pronouns) to indicate their role as subject or (direct) object in Kamsá, there
is no morphological difference between subjects and objects. Also, because the word order in
Kamsá is very free, it is generally not possible to use word order to discern which NP is the
subject and which is the object in a transitive clause. In (21), there is no expressed subject; the
NP mongoj ‘deer’ is the direct object of the verb. There is no extra morphology on mongoj to
indicate what its role in the sentence is.
(21)Bojashbwá mongoj.
bo-jashbwá mongoj
DU-PAST-hunt deer
‘He hunted a deer.’ (Chindoy 60:2)204Pronouns can also serve as objects in a verb phrase. They are not marked any differently
from full NP direct objects. In (22a). the object is ats̈ ‘1SG’. Note that the verb agrees with ats̈ in
person and number. The noun ndëts̈-be ‘rock’ is marked with an instrumental case marker. In
(2b), the subject is the first person singular pronoun ats̈. When comparing of (22b) in which ats̈
‘1SG’ is the subject of a transitive clause with (22a) in which ats̈ ‘1SG’ is the object, it can be
seen that the form of the pronoun is the same regardless of whether it is serving as subject or as
object. In (22c), ats̈ ‘1SG’ is the subject of the sentence and has the topic marker -na. When a
pronoun is the direct object of a verb, it does not have to be expressed, as seen in example (20b)
above, in which the verbal prefix k- ‘2SG’ shows that the object is second person singular.

Some other parts of speech can also serve as objects within VPs. In (23), the
demonstrative mwa is the object of the imperative form of the verb jolempia ‘clean’ (from
Spanish limpiar ‘clean’) and the numeral kanÿe ‘one’ is the object of the verb jasan ‘eat’.

Verb phrases can also contain obliques—that is, NPs that are marked with case-markedsuffixes but do not play the role of core arguments (subject, object, or object of a distransitive) of
the verb. In (24a) bobonts ‘young man’ bears the allative marker -bioy. In (24b), ndweñang
‘owners’ has the benefactive marker. (Note that ndweñ ‘owner’ is from Spanish dueño ‘owner’;
the initial alveolar stop is prenasalized, following the phonology of Kamsá, imposed by some
speakers on Spanish loan words as well). In (24c), bata ‘aunt’ has the locative marker -bioka.
None of these verb phrases has an expressed direct object.

jajan ‘chagra (small farm)’ marked as locative (jajan loses the final n and becomes jaja + -ok,
then jajok) and taita ‘father’ marked as comitative.

Verbs can sometimes be ditransitive and take two objects without marking either objectas an oblique. In (26), neither twamb ‘hen’ nor wabem ‘sister’ is marked for case.

Verbs can also have a direct object and an oblique. In (28a) the direct object iswameshnen ‘mote’ and the first singular plural pronoun bëng is marked with the benefactive
clitic =bi-am. In (28b) the direct object is also wameshnen ‘mote’ and the NP ats̈be wampnan

then widely borrowed from one indigenous language to the next.
2425-bi is used for case marking on animate nouns.","[216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"
"95It is interesting to note that there is a contrast between singular, plural, and dual first
person and no contrast between inclusive and exclusive plural first person, a common feature of
many languages in the area.
Additionally, there are optional suffixes that show that the subject of a verb is plural or
dual (-ang and -at, respectively). Although these suffixes can co-occur with number marking
prefixes, they are often used when the number marking prefixes are not present.
The following sentences show verbs marked with the first person plural prefix bs- (often
pronounced [fs-], perhaps because of different dialects or free variation). In (9a), the verb
jamnan ‘be’ is marked with the prefix bsë-, without any overt (pronominal) subject included in
the clause. In (9b), on the other hand, the first person plural pronoun bëng is present in the
clause, and the verb jets̈an ‘lose’ is marked with bsë- to agree with it. Similarly, in (9c), japasar
‘pass, be’ is marked with bsë-, indexing the first person plural pronoun bëng.

Another option is for the verb to index only first person without indexing plural. In (11),
the first person prefix së- indexes the first person plural subject bëng on the verb j-ab-an ‘leave’.
It does not index number, only first person.

Whereas the useof this prefix indexes both (second) person and (plural) number, it is possible for a verb agreeing
with a second person plural subject to index just one or the other feature (as is the case with first
person plural subjects, 4.2.4). Thus, a verb that agrees with a second person plural subject can
simply be marked for second person with ko- or for plural with mo-. In (12a) the conquistadors
are telling the Kamsá people that they (the Kamsás) will build a chapel in a certain spot. The
prefix s̈mo- identifies the second person plural subject ‘you (pl)’, otherwise unspecified in the
clause. In (12b) the second person plural pronoun tsëngafta7 is used. (Note: the pronoun is
usually tsëngaftang, as -ang is the plural suffix on nouns, pronouns, verbs, and adjectives.)

It is important to note that s̈mo- is confusingly the same morpheme as the composite for a first
person object s̈- and third person plural agent mo-. Thus, ‘you all are screaming’ and ‘they are
screaming at me’ would both have s̈mo-.
This is discussed further below, but for now these morphemes are summarized below:

4.2.7First person dual marking
There is no specific verbal marker to indicate first person dual subjects. That is, no prefixencodes both first person and dual number. First person dual subjects can be indexed with the
dual marker bo-, the first person marker së-, and bsë-. It is possible that such subjects can
alternatively be marked with the plural marker mo-, but I do not have examples of mo- marking
first person dual in my data.
In (14a), the verb j-wabw-an ‘cook’ is marked with the dual marker bo-, agreeing with
the first dual pronoun bëndat in the same clause. In (14b), the two verbs jashjango ‘arrive’ and
jatay ‘spend the night’ are marked with the dual marker bo-. Here, there is no overt subject, but
the subject is understood to be first person (dual) since the sentence belongs to a text in which a
man is planning with his brother. In (14c), the verb jan ‘go’ is marked with së-, the first person
marker. Here, the subject of the verb is overtly expressed and seen to be dual: is ats̈ i ats̈be bemb
‘my daughter and I’. In (14d), there is the prefix bs- for a dual subject.

both verbs are marked with s̈o- to agree with the second person dual subject pronoun tsëndat.
Also in (15b) the verb j-aman ‘sleep’ is marked with s̈o- to agree with tsëndat, whereas in (15c)
the verb is marked simply with the dual marker bo-, which does not index person. Note that in

Confusingly, the prefix s̈o- is also the prefix that indexes third person singular subject

first person singular object ats̈ ‘I, me’. Object marking is discussed in 4.3.

in (17a) on j-ashjango ‘arrive’ and (17b) with jamnan ‘be’. It is possible that third person dual
subjects can be indexed with the plural verbal prefix mo- but I do not have any examples of this
in my data.

It is important to note that the prefix bo- for third person dual subject is the same as the
(optional) prefix for third person subject and third person object. In (18) bo- is on the verb jashjango ‘arrive’ to agree with the null subject (two brothers). The same prefix is on the verb jabwayenan ‘advise’ where both the Agent and the Theme are animate: wabochená ‘older
brother’ and wabentsa ‘younger brother’, respectively. Note that in this example, the theme has
the allative marker -bioy. There are two possible analyses for this. The first is homophony: bocan be third person dual or third subject and object. The other possibility is that bo- indexes the
total number of participants. Throughout this dissertation, I gloss bo- as DU-.

4.2.10 Suffixes for marking number: plural -ang and dual -at
Verbs can exhibit number suffixes in addition to the person/number prefixes. These are
the plural suffix -ang and the dual suffix -at. They are identical to the number suffixes that occur
on nouns and they are optional.
In (19a) and (19b), the verbs are prefixed with plural person prefixes with special plural
and dual markers as suffixes (-ang for plural, -at for dual). Note that the vowel /a/ in -at is
deleted when it follows another vowel.

In the following two examples, the verb exhibits the second person plural prefix s̈m-. In
(20a) the verb additionally contains a plural suffix, whereas in (20b) the verb contains a dual
suffix. These suffixes thus serve to specify the number of the referent (plural or dual). Although
prefixes are not always specific for number, suffixes seem always to be specific: -ang is always
for plural subjects, and -at is always for dual subjects.

This section (4.2) has illustrated person and number marking prefixes and suffixes on
verbs. As shown, the verb can be more specific or less specific for person or number. The
following section (4.3) will discuss object marking.
4.3Object marking on verbs
In addition to indexing subjects, transitive verbs index objects with bound, obligatoryprefixes. Although grammatical objects need not be overtly expressed as free words (whether
independent personal pronouns or full NPs), it is obligatory to index objects with verbal prefixes
allowing for a null prefix for third person referents; that is to say, first and second person objects
are marked on the verb. First person and second person (object) pronouns can co-occur with
object marking prefixes, although they are not obligatory. The object prefix is the first prefix on
the verb, followed by the subject prefix (which is itself followed by any TAM prefixes). Direct
objects are marked. When the construction is ditransitive, it is the Goal and not the theme that is
marked. This chapter focuses on morphology.
In most TAM distinctions (excluding, future and conditional), neither third person
subjects nor third person objects are overtly marked on verbs. Although the first person subject
marker and first person object marker have different forms (së- and s̈-, respectively), the second
person object marker is identical to the second person subject marker. Thus, in clauses with third
person subjects and second person objects (or with second person subjects and third person
objects), only the second person argument is overtly marked on the verb (with the prefix k-). It is
thus impossible (from the shape of the verb alone) to determine whether the second person
argument is the subject or the object of the verb.
The first person object prefix is s̈-, the second person object prefix is k- (the same as its
subject prefix counterpart), and the third person object prefix is null (Ø-). These forms are used
for all TAM distinctions. Number is not marked in any way for object prefixes. Thus, plural
objects never receive the plural marker mo-, nor do dual objects receive the dual marker bo-.
Similarly, neither the portmanteau first person plural subject prefix bsë- nor the portmanteau
second person plural subject prefix s̈mo- has an equivalent object prefix form. Plural first person104objects are marked with s̈- and plural second person objects are marked with s̈mo-.
The first person subject prefix is bo- when the object is second person (regardless of the
number of either the subject or the object). The third person singular subject prefix is also bowhen the object is third person (regardless of the number of the object). Thus, first person subject
with second object is kbo-, with k- marking the second object and bo- showing that the subject is
first person. The first person singular subject prefix is never bo- when there isn’t an object.
Object marking is usually the same for non-singular as for singular.
All of the prefixes that encode subject and object end in o-, so this could perhaps be
analyzable as something to do with transitivity, but it also appears in intransitive verbs.
Figure 4.2 (on the following page) summarizes the person marking for verbs, showing the
various possible combinations of subject and object prefixes.","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"

1SGNegation is shown by the negator word ndoñ, negative indefinite pronouns, and/or verbal
morphology. The language does not allow double negatives, meaning that either the negator
word ndoñ is used or a negative indefinite pronoun, but never both at the same time. The
language can have, however, negative verbal morphology and the negator ndoñ in the same
clause. When the verb is negative, the negator ndoñ is usually there but sometimes negation can
be shown by verbal morphology without the negator. Similarly, although the verb usually has
negative morphology, sometimes negation can be shown with ndoñ without any special
morphology on the verb. The verbal morphology of negation is discussed in 4.9. Here I discuss
the syntax of such constructions.","[232, 233, 234]"

Figure 7.1 Common adverbs in Kamsá
Many adverbs are composites of two words, sometimes two Kamsá words, andsometimes a Kamsá word and a word of Spanish origin. Several adverbs are formed from a
Kamsá word and té ‘day’, (presumably from Spanish dia ‘day’) which is a stressed clitic,
attaching to other words; the stress is always on te. For example, mnte ‘today’ is formed from the
Kamsá demonstrative mwa and té, ‘day’. Similarly, kadaté ‘every day’ and kanÿeté ‘one day’ are
formed with kada from Spanish cada ‘each’ and te, and Kamsá kanÿe ‘one’ and te. Some
adverbs are formed from the intensifier kach, including kachiñ ‘again’ kachës ‘early’ and kachor
‘instantly’ (presumably from Spanish ahora ‘now’). One interesting composite is tonjapasaibs
‘yesterday’ formed with the Kamsá word ibs ‘tomorrow’, tonja ‘he/she went’, and pasa from
Spanish pasar ‘to spend, pass’14. Some common adverbs are loan words from Spanish, such as
mor ‘now’ from Spanish ahora ‘now’ and ya ‘already’ from Spanish ya. This chart does not
include all temporal adverbs in the language.
Sentences (1a-i) show adverbs. In all of the sentences, except (1k), (1i) and (1m), the
adverb is the first element in the clause. In (1a) kachiñ ‘again’ is at the beginning of the clause.
In (1b) mor means ‘now’. In (1c) ibs ‘tomorrow’ is at the beginning of the clause, and the verb
has the future tense. Similarly in (1d) the clause begins with tonjapasaibs ‘yesterday’ for past
tense. In (1e) and (1f) the clauses start with kanÿna ‘once’ and kanÿe te ‘one day’, respectively.
In (1g) the clause starts with kadate ‘each day’. In (1h), the clause (and the story) begins with
anteo ‘long ago’. In (1i) natsan ‘before’ goes at the beginning of the NP, meaning something like
‘the gold-before-knower’, i.e. the one who knew first where the gold was. Some of these words
can also be used adverbially as seen in the following two examples with natsan ‘before’. In (1j),
The etymology of tonjapasaibs is strange, because one would expect it to mean ‘day after tomorrow’ rather than
‘yesterday’.
14161natsan is used to refer to an event that had happened earlier, that the brother had warned him
about earlier. In (1k) natsan is used to mean ‘ahead’ or ‘fast’. In (1l) empas ‘forever’ is used. In
(1m) ya is used, in much the same way as Spanish ya ‘already’. In (1n) the clause begins with
kachor-a ‘instantly’, which is a composite of the intensifier ka-, chor, and epenthetic vowel /a/.
In (1o) moben ‘soon, quickly’ is at the beginning of the clause, after the conjunction i ‘and’. In
(1p) the word kaba ‘still’ is used. These words are not inflected at all and do not agree with
anything in class, case, evaluative, etc.

"24Fifth, Juan Bautista Jacanamijoy Juajibioy, a Kamsá taita who worked with SIL for many
years, began compiling a dictionary. He was disappeared in 2008 and never finished the project,
but other community members have been working on completing it and it will be published soon.
In addition to these five people, Alain Fabre (2000) has written a brief grammatical sketch of the
language: “Algunos rasgos tipológicos del Kamsá (Valle de Sibundoy, Alto Putumayo, sudoeste
de Colombia) vistos desde una perspectiva areal” (‘Several typological features of Kamsá seen
from an areal perspective, Sibundoy Valley, Upper Putumayo, southeast Colombia’). It gives a
brief description of some features of the language, using existing sources, and he describes agent
and patient marking and noun classifiers in the language. This 30-page sketch is perhaps the best
linguistic description of the language. He also wrote a similar paper in English: “Kamsá, a poorly
documented isolated language spoken in South-Western Colombia” (Fabre 2001). There is also
an MA thesis in 2013 by Chloé Garsault about the phonology of the language, called ""Éléments
de sociolinguistique et de phonologie du kamsá, langue isolée du sud-ouest Colombien""
(“Elements of socioloinguistics and phonology of Kamsá, a language isolate of Southwest
Colombia”) and an MA thesis by a Kamsá linguist, María Clara Juajiboy Mutumbajoy, in Bogotá
in 1995 called “Actancia verbal en Kamentsa” (“Verbal agreement in Kamentsa).
In addition to these linguistic works, there are several collections of stories and poems in
Kamsá and many books and articles about Kamsá culture. In addition to McDowell’s book of
Kamsá stories, there are also two books of stories compiled and translated by Alberto Juajibioy
Chindoy, both containing Kamsá and Spanish texts side-by-side and glossaries at the end of each
book. One is called Relatos ancestrales del folclor camentsa ‘Ancestral tales of Camentsa
folklore’ (1988) and the other is Lenguaje Ceremonial y Narraciones Tradicionales de La
Cultura Kamënts̈á ‘Ceremonial Language and Traditional Narratives of the Kamënts̈á Culture’.
There is a doctoral dissertation by Haydée Seijas (1969) at Tulane University called The
medicinal system of the Sibundoy Indians, in which she discusses the medical practices of the
Kamsá and Inga. There is an excellent book about the history of the Capuchins in Sibundoy
Valley, Servants of Gods or Masters of Men?: The Story of a Capuchin Mission in Amazonia, by
Victor Daniel Bonilla (1971). There is a Kamsá poet, Hugo Jamioy Juagibioy (2005), who
published a book of poetry in Kamsá and Spanish called Danzantes del viento / Bínÿbe
oboyejuayeng (‘Dancers of the wind’ in English). Finally, there was a doctoral dissertation
published in 2018 about the philosophy, culture, and language of Kamsá by Alejandro Chindoy,25called Constituted and constituting symbols of the Kamënts̈á culture: essays on native philosophy
of culture. There are also many pedagogical materials made by the Kamsá community and/or
SIL.
1.5Methodology
This dissertation is based on fieldwork that I conducted with Kamsá speakers inSibundoy Valley and Bogotá. I spent a total of 18 months in Colombia between 2015 and 2018;
of that time, I spent about 6 months in Sibundoy. I worked mainly with older Kamsá speakers,
above the age of 60, some of whom had never left the Putumayo/Nariño region. I recorded word
lists, elicitations, conversations, traditional stories, and life histories in Kamsá and Spanish. This
dissertation includes one of these texts, which shows the influence of Spanish on the language.
Because there are so many existing texts in the language (albeit without grammatical description
or glossing) I also took advantage of these existing materials for ideas and hypotheses about the
grammar. The example sentences in this dissertation come both from my own recordings
(elicitations and texts) and from these other sources. Sample sentences from Chindoy’s and
McDowell’s stories are marked as such; from my eliciations are marked MC; and from my
longer texts are marked with the date. All recordings were WAV files, recorded with a
TASCAM recorder, except for a few recordings done by a couple of Kamsá friends on their cell
phones.
All materials, including audio recordings of traditional stories, conversations between
speakers, and elicitations will be archived with AILLA (Archive of Indigenous Languages of
Latin America). I chose AILLA because it is the main archive for languages of Latin America
and it is also where McDowell archived his Kamsá materials. They have agreed to archive the
materials.

7.3.5Other locative words
There are other words related to location in Kamsá that do not fit neatly into anycategory. They can be nouns, adjectives, postpositions, and maybe adverbs. Some examples are:
bënok ‘far’, bekon ‘close’, tsjwan ‘above’, and stonoy ‘below’. Figure 7.5 shows these words.

(15d) bënok has the allative marker -oy and is used in a command telling someone to go far
away. Finally, in (15e) there is an extra morpheme -ën, the function of which is unclear.

In (16) examples with bekon ‘close’ are shown. In (16a) bekon is used adverbially as well
as in (16b). In (16b), however, bekon has extra morphology: bekonan. It is not clear why. In
(16c), bekonan is a postposition, part of a postpositional phrase: ‘close to the waterfall’.
Similarly, in (16d) bekonan is a postposition. It is not clear why the NP in (16d) has the genitive

Similar to the deictics for ‘here’ and ‘there’ are the words for ‘inside’ and ‘outside’, tsok
and shjok, respectively. They both end with the locative marker -ok and can also have the allative
-oy (tsoy, shjoy) and the ablative -an. They can also be postpositions, unlike the deictics. In (19a)
tsok ‘inside’ is used without other case markers, and without any NP. In (19b) tsok has the
allative marker to become tsoy because the dog is entering the inside area. Similarly, in (19c)
tsok has the allative marker -oy because the item is being brought to the inside. Also note that in
this sentence, tsoy ‘to inside’ is used to mean ‘to the house’. In (19d) shjok has the ablative
marker =an and means ‘from outside’.

This morpheme could be either ka which is perhaps a discourse particle or -k for locative followed by an

Kamsá has many function words that appear to have no precise or easy translation. First,I discuss four words that seem related etymologically: nÿe, nÿa, nÿets, and nÿetsá. Then I discuss
other particles and function words including: chor ‘then, thus’; chka ‘in this way, like this’;
mënts̈á ‘in this way, like this’; and aiñ ‘yes’ when being used as an intensifier. Figure 7.6
presents function words and particles.

Figure 7.6 Function words and particles7.4.1The function word nÿe ‘only’
The word nÿe is extremely common. It has three uses. It can be used in parallelstructures; it can be used alone to mean ‘only’; and it can strengthen words/phrases.
In (29a-c), nÿe is used to create parallel structures. In (29a) the first clause has the
subordinator =as and has a concessive meaning, and the second clause has the conjunction pero
‘but’. In (29b), nÿe is used to convey ‘not only, but also…’; the first clause has an inflected verb
jamnan ‘be’ while the second clause has an uninflected verb marked with the benefactive clitic
=am. Also note that jamnan ‘be’ in the first clause has the emphatic marker kwa-. In (29c) nÿe is180used twice to create parallel structures within a single clause, first before a list of nouns and then
before lempe ‘all’.

The following examples show nÿe meaning ‘only’. In these examples nÿe is used just
once, unlike the examples in (29) where it is used twice to create parallel structures. Even when
it is only used once, nÿe shows a contrast. In (30a) nÿe modifies ‘three days’, to contrast with
another person (who stayed in hell for longer than three days). In (30b) nÿe modifies
shloftŝëngbe mëntŝen ‘meat of birds’ to mean it is the only thing that he eats. In (30c) nÿe
modifies uta shloftsë to mean ‘only two birds’, i.e. he didn’t hunt more than two birds. As in the
example above where nÿe is used twice to create parallel structures, when it is used only once it
creates a contrast. In (30d) nÿe is used with the verb phrase ‘start to follow’.

There are two negator words in Kamsa. The negator word in Kamsa is ndoñ and it cannegate any word class and tonday means ‘there isn’t’ and negates nouns. In the following
examples, there is no verb. In predicative constructions, a copula is not necessary. In (9a) ndoñ
negates the adjective ts̈aba ‘good’ and in (9b) it negates mas ‘more’. Neither clause has a verb.
In (9c) and (9d) tonday ‘there is not’ is used, to show the nonexistence of shloftsts̈unga ‘birds’

4.9Negation
Negation in Kamsá is shown by the negator word ndoñ preceding the verb. Usually, whena verb is negated it has the irrealis prefix ke- and the negative prefix at-. The ke- comes before
person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and evidential marking, while the at- come after all of
those markers, closer to the verb root. Neither morpheme is obligatory, however, and it is
possible simply to have the negator word ndoñ without the irrealis prefix or the negative prefix.
Furthermore, in some tenses, such as distant past, a different negative prefix is used, namely nor nd-, both of which are homophonous with other prefixes in the language, i.e. evidential
marker and present habitual, respectively.
4.9.1ndoñ with ke- and atA common way to negate verbs is to use the irrealis marker ke- which comes at thebeginning of the word, preceding the subject marker, and at- which comes closer to the root,
after the aspect markers. In (60a), the j-amn-an ‘be’ is negated with ndoñ and the verb has both
prefixes ke- and at-. In (60b-c) j-amënts̈na ‘be tired’ is shown with and without the negative
marking. In (60b) and (60c) the verb has an agreement marker s̈- for first person agreement. In
(60c) the first person agreement marker s̈- comes after ke- and before at-. In (60d-e) j-apten ‘to
rain’ is shown with and without negative marking. In (60e) the evidential marker n- comes
between ki- and at-. It is phonetically ki- not ke-. (60f) shows j-abowenynan ‘remember’ with
131the irrealis prefix ke- followed by the first person singular marker ts- and then the negative
marker at- and (60g) has j-opasan ‘happen’.

aFigure 2.1 Kamsá vowels (in the IPA)34Back
u
o2.2.1.1 Distribution of /u, e, o, a/
The four vowels that are definitely distinct phonemes in Kamsá are /u/, /e/, /o/, and /a/.
Because most Kamsá words are rather long, there are few true minimal pairs in the language.
There are, however, a number of near minimal pairs, showing the distribution of these four
vowels. The following examples illustrate that different vowels can occur in identical
environments.
u and e:
xunatsan ‘carry multiple things’xenabajan ‘come, multiple people’Both vowels can occur in the first (unstressed) syllable, between a voiceless velar fricative x and
an alveolar nasal n.
u and o:
xutsnaʃa ‘bed’xotsbanan ‘get up’Both vowels can occur in the first (unstressed) syllable, between a voiceless velar fricative x and
a voiceless alveolar affricate ts.
u and a:
kukwatʂ ‘hand’kakan ‘raw’Both vowels can occur in a stressed first syllable, between two voiceless velar stops k. Some
more examples are:
tʃumbo ‘turkey’
xuʃaɲ ‘crack, crevice’tʃam ‘for this’
xaʃnan ‘apply medicine’e and o:
xenoboten ‘get bigger’xonanan ‘feel’Both vowels can occur between a voiceless velar fricative x and an alveolar nasal n.
e and a:
nde (response to a greeting)nda ‘who’Both can occur in open syllables, following a prenasalized alveolar stop nd.
o and a:
obona ‘fat’obana ‘dead’35Both vowels can occur the second (stressed) syllable, between a voiced bilabial stop b and an
alveolar nasal n.
All four of these vowels can occur between two consonants (specifically stops), as seen
below.
u: kukwatʂ ‘hand’
e: bekon ‘close’
o: bokoj ‘chicha (a fermented beverage)’
a: bata ‘aunt’
All four of the vowels can be word initial, as seen below.
u: uta ‘two’
e: enuta ‘friend’
o: obana ‘dead’
a: ak ‘you (singular)’
Only three of the four vowels (/e, o, a/) can occur word finally, however, as seen below. There is
no attested form ending in *u#.
e: maʃakbe ‘lulo fruit’
o: tʃumbo ‘turkey’
a: moka ‘here’
2.2.1.2 The high front vowel [i]
The status of the high front vowel i is less clear. It seems to be an allophone of /e/, as the
two phones are in complementary distribution. The form [i] is only found preceding palatal (or
palatal-alveolar) consonants (/ʃ, ⁿdʒ, tʃ, ɲ, j, ʎ/), whereas [e] never precedes a palatal (or palatalalveolar) consonant, as illustrated by the following:
(1a)
(1b)
(1c)
(1d)
(1e)empas ‘finished’
ena ‘pure’
iⁿdʒa ‘other’ (i preceding a prenasalized voiced palato-alveolar affricate)
iɲe ‘fire’ (i preceding a palatal nasal)
itʃan- [future prefix] (i preceding a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate)Thus, the following phonological process could be posited:
e → i / _ palatal
36/i/ before palatal glides
/i/ is also inserted before the glide /j/, just as /u/ can occur before /w/.
Ø → i / _ glide
There are, however, a few places where i occurs that are not predictable, running counter
to the posited palatal rule above (i.e., a limited number of lexemes exhibit [i] preceding nonpalatal consonants). First, there are three words (likely etymologically related) that contain the
form [ib] (all three of these words have something to do with time): ibeta ‘night’, ibs
‘tomorrow’, and tonxapasaibs ‘yesterday’. Note that tonxapasaibs contains the Spanish-derived
element pasa (from pasar ‘spend time’).
A second exceptional [i] is found in the verbal prefix is-, which designates movement
‘from a place’. The following three verbs exemplify this derivational prefix.
xiseboknan ‘leave from’
xisoᵑɡwefxwan ‘fly from’
xisetsxwan ‘go up frome’
The third exception is the third person singular present marker i-, as seen below.
i-n-ts-abwana ‘he/she is cooking’
There is a fourth possible exception to the rule of [i] only being found preceding palatal
consonants, as there appears to be a noun class marker of the form -i (3.2.4). Nouns represented
by this class and the adjectives that agree with them all end in [-i]. This final high front vowel
could, however, underlyingly be the palatal glide /j/, which becomes syllabic when occurring
word-finally and following a consonant, as shown below:

8.3.8Verbs that take case-marked objects
Some verbs, which on semantic grounds seem very much to be transitive, neverthelessco-occur with nouns (i.e., objects) marked by an oblique case. Such verbs could perhaps be
analyzed as intransitive, but with an argument structure that includes an oblique-marked nominal
argument. Alternatively, they can be analyzed as transitive, but with a (lexically determined)
stipulated selectional restriction that their direct-object arguments must be marked as oblique
NPs. The verb jwajabwachan ‘help’, for example, takes a allative-marked NP as its object. In
(33), the object of jwajabwachan ‘help’ is patronang ‘owners’, here marked with the allative
suffix -bi-oy.

Postpositional phrases in Kamsá consist of a noun followed by a postposition. Often casemarkers are also present: case markers can occur on the postposition itself, on the noun, or on
both the postposition and the noun. In (34a), the postposition tsëntsa ‘middle’ follows the noun
tsa ‘room’ and tsëntsa has the locative marker -k. Similarly, in (34b) tsëntsa has the case marker
210-k and the NP preceding it, chëng ‘3PL’, has the genitive marker -be. In (34c) the third person
singular pronoun cha has the genitive marker -be when it precedes bekonan ‘close’. An
alternative analysis is that these are not postpositions, but rather nouns. In (34d) the tsëntsak is
used nominally without any other noun (i.e. just ‘in the middle’ not ‘in the middle of the room’).
Another analysis is that these are compound nouns, not postpositions.

‘(arriving) at the middle, it begin to get bright.’ (Chindoy 70:14)
8.5Prepositional phrases
Although Kamsá normally employs postpositions, it has borrowed some prepositionsfrom Spanish. There are no native prepositions in the language (only postpositions), but the
Spanish prepositions are very common now. In (35a), the preposition sin ‘without’ (from
Spanish sin ‘without’) precedes the noun tamo ‘salt’. Nouns governed by the loan preposition sin
take the instrumental case marker -k, as does tamo ‘salt’ below. If the preposition sin were not
present in this sentence, then the phrase would mean ‘with salt’, as illustrated in (35b).
It is interesting to note that the language has postpositions, and that all subordinators go
at the end of clauses, such as the general subordinator -as and ora ‘when’, but that it has started
borrowing prepositions, and subordinators that go at the beginning of clauses (like ante ‘before’),
so now you can have a mix of things going at the end of phrases and clauses and at the beginning
211of verbs and clauses. Furthermore, it is possible that adpositions and subordinators borrowed
from Spanish earlier (maybe several centuries ago) became postpositions or clause final
subordinators, such as ora ‘when’ from Spanish hora ‘time, hour’, whereas recent borrowings
became prepositions or clause initial subordinators.

(35b) wameshnen tamok
wameshnen [tamo=k]
mote
[salt=INS]
‘mote (hominy soup) with salt’
In (36a) another common preposition. asta ‘until’ (from Spanish hasta ‘until’), precedes
bastok ‘Pasto (a city near Sibundoy)’. This preposition can have a noun or an infinitive object;
when it takes an infinitive, it is always an uninflected. In (36a) asta bastok means ‘until Pasto’. It
is unclear whether there is case marking on bastok because, like many place names, the
unmarked form is already locative (such as bogotok ‘Bogotá’; tabanok ‘Sibundoy’ and chatjok
‘Mocoa’). In (36b) asta ‘until’ is the preposition and the infinitive belongs to the prepositional
phrase. The verb jwenatjëmb ‘disappear’ is not inflected for person, number, or TAM. In (36c)
asta precedes shachna ‘five’, which is used substantively and has the plural marker -ëng.

parejo ‘similar, equal, close, next to’. It is interesting because its meaning has shifted from the
Spanish meaning mostly as an adjective to become a preposition. Its noun has a case marker:
commitative for animate nouns and instrumental for inanimate nouns. In (37a) parej
enuntëngaftaka means ‘together with (her) friends’ where enuntëng ‘friends’ has the comitative
marker -aftak. In (37b) parej twambianak means ‘together with that of the hen’ (meaning the
brother discarded the chili along with the piece of hen). Note that in (37b) the noun has the
ablative marker to show source; it does not have -bi even though it’s an animal (and living
animals are animate) because in this sense it is food; and it does not show any object marking.

Simple clauses (monoclausal sentences)
9.1Introduction
In this chapter, I provide an overview of clause-level syntax in Kamsá, a clause beingminimally a verb and a subject (expressed or not expressed). Because verbs are marked for
person and number, a noun or pronoun is not obligatory, thus a clause could be simply a verb.
First I discuss clauses (9.2) including intransitive (9.2.1), predicative (9.2.2), then transitive
clauses (9.2.3) and clauses with complements (9.2.4). In (9.2.5) I discuss clauses with obliques
and in (9.2.6) I discuss ditransitive clauses. In (9.3) I discuss negation and in (9.4) I discuss
comparatives and superlatives. (9.5) covers imperatives and (9.6) describes interrogatives.
Indexing on the verb clearly shows that the system is nominative-accusative: subjects of
transitive verbs have the same morphemes as subjects of intransitives, both contrasting with the
marking of objects of transitives. NPs and personal pronouns are not marked in any way for
Agent or Patient (see 3.3.3 on noun cases). As seen in the following examples, although the
nouns and pronouns do not have any morphology for case, the verbal morphology is
nominative/accusative.

3SG.PST-EVI-VBLZ-goThe following sections cover intransitive clasues (9.2.1), predicative clasues (9.2.2),
transitive clauses (9.2.3), clauses with complements (9.2.4), clauses with obliques (9.2.5), and
ditransitive clauses (9.2.6).
9.2.1Intransitive clauses
In intransitive sentences, the word order is almost always SV, whether the subject is apronoun or a noun. In (2a) the verb j-ashjajna ‘arrive’ is preceded by bobonts-ënga ‘young men’.
In (2b) j-abokna ‘leave’ is preceded by oso ‘bear’. In (2c) j-abostero ‘lie’ is preceded by the first
person singular pronoun ats̈ whereas in (2d) j-amanan ‘sleep’ doesn’t have any overt subject, but
the prefix së- on the verb shows that it is first person singular. In (2e) j-asapten ‘rain’ is inflected
as third person singular. Although the subject usually precedes the verb, in (2f) the subject kanÿe
baká wabon ‘one horrible spirit’ follows the verb jashjango ‘arrive’. It is possible that in
intransitive sentences the subject is more likely to follow the verb if it is heavier as in (2f) in
which the subject is kanÿe baká wabon bachnaj kapuchinká pormaná ‘one horrible spirit dressed
as a priest’, but more research is needed.

‘A horrible spirit, dressed as a capuchin priest, arrived.’ (Chindoy)9.2.2Predicative with jamnan ‘be’porma-ná
dressed-TOPPredicative clauses are formed with j-amn-an ‘be’. It is inflected in the same way as other
Kamsá verbs. The word order is flexible. In (3a) tsbwanach ‘leaf’ is bëts ‘big’. Note that the
adjective agrees with the class of the noun. In (3b) santopes ‘centipede’ is a botaman shembasa
‘beautiful woman’. In (3c) j-amn-an ‘be’ is used for location yebën-ents̈ ‘in the house’. Similarly
in (3d) jamnan is used for location chents̈ ‘there’ and is marked with the third person plural
prefix mo- to agree with the plural subject. In (3d-f) other persons are shown. In (3g) the
personal pronoun is not used, but the verbal inflection shows that it is second person plural,
indicated by s̈mo-.
The verb j-amn-an is inflected for TAM in addition to person and number. In (3a) it has
the marker nd- to show a habitual state, whereas in (3b) it is distant past because it is in a
traditional story. In addition, the adjectives agree with the nouns or pronouns. In (3a) the216adjective agrees with the class of the noun and in (3f) and (3g) wayan ‘hated’ agrees with ‘you
all’ and ‘we’ in number, shown by the plural marker -ëng.

Kamsá has no dominant word order (Fabre 2001). In his typological sketch of Kamsá, Fabre says217that out of one hundred instances he found a slight predominance of VERB + PATIENT (56%).
Most AGENT NPs appear first, but the inverse order is not rare either (Fabre 2001).
The following examples show various options for word order. In (4a) and (4b) the word
order is SVO and in (4c) and (4d) it is SOV.

birdClauses where the verb has a complement tend to have the following word order:
subject - verb - complement.
If the complement has an object, that object precedes the verbal complement. In (5a) the verb jonts̈á ‘begin’ has the complement j-akwentan ‘tell’. The oblique shachbuyek ‘with tears’
precedes both the verb and the complement. In (5b) and (5c), intransitive verbs have verbal
complements. In (5d) j-oben ‘be able to’ has a complement, and in (5e) j-anpochoká ‘stop’. The
word order in (5e) is different, perhaps because it is part of a subordinate clause. The verbs jonts̈á ‘begin’, j-oben ‘be able to’ and j-anpochoká ‘stop’ all commonly take complements. The
verb in the complement is almost always non-finite, nominal in form.","[222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"
"45A syllable in Kamsa typically consists of a single-vowel nucleus, to which may be added
up to two consonants in the onset and up to two consonants in the coda. Alternatively, the
nucleus can be a consonant, but if there are more than two consonants in a syllable, an epenthetic
high central vowel /ɨ/ is inserted.
The following words exhibit syllables containing onsets consisting of a single consonant:
betsko ‘fast’
kanta ‘four’
maʃakbe ‘lulo fruit’
sasna ‘food’
ʃaxwan ‘bean’
tabanok ‘village’
wabon ‘spirit’
xan ‘go’
The following word contains syllables with two consonants in a single onset.
stonoj ‘behind’
Vowel initial words in Kamsa are rare, but are possible, as seen by the following words.
atʂ ‘I’
enutá ‘friend’
obaná ‘dead’
uta ‘two’
2.4Stress
Kamsá words generally have penultimate stress, although there are a few cases wherestress is ultimate. Thus, stress is phonemic, not fully predictable. Stress cannot fall on syllables
other than the penult or ultima.
Some words have lexically determined ultimate stress. This is particularly common for
nouns ending in /-a/, such as wabowán ‘horrible’ and batá ‘aunt’. There is a tendency for nouns
that end in an open syllable with /a/ or /o/ or a closed syllable with /an/ to have ultimate stress,
but it is not always the case.
Stress is usually penultimate, but it can be ultimate as well. For ultimate stress, only
syllables with /a/, /o/, or /e/ as the nucleus can take stress. In the following examples, /a/, /o/, and46/e/ are in the final syllable and have stress. /i/, /u/, and /ɨ/ never have stress in the ultimate
syllable.
batá ‘aunt’
bakó ‘uncle’
ʃaxbé ‘cucumber’
Words that end with closed syllables have penultimate stress.
bastok ‘Pasto’
benach ‘path’
The high back vowel /u/ can be stressed when occurring in the penult of a word with
default penultimate stress, but there are no Kamsá words with /u/ in the last syllable.
While ultimate stress can be lexically determined, it can be morphologically determined
as well: verbs have ultimate stress in the infinitive, as in the following examples (note that the
infinitive always ends in -an).
xaxanán ‘to say’
xwaʃɨntsán ‘to plant corn’
Although this ultimate stress appears to be morphologically conditioned, it could instead
be that there is something (phonological) about final -an that attracts stress. Indeed, there are
words belonging to other classes that end in -an, which also have ultimate stress, such as
wabowán ‘horrible’.
Although there are not many minimal pairs in Kamsá (in part because words tend to be
quite long), there is at least one minimal pair in the language based on stress alone: whereas the
word ena ‘pure’ has penultimate stress, the word ená ‘seller’ has ultimate stress.
Some clitics always take the stress, namely the clitic te ‘day’, as in kada-té ‘each day’
2.5Loan phonology
Due to the influence of Spanish, Kamsá has acquired several (relatively) new phonemes,which speakers recognize as different sounds. These occur only in loanwords. Words with stops
are now being borrowed with the stop /d/ or /g/ instead of with the prenasalized equivalent. /r/
and /ʎ/ are also common and found only in loan words (from Spanish or Inga). Finally [p] (which
47also occur in Kamsá as an allophone of /b/) is recognized by speakers as phonemically distinct
when occurring in loanwords, and so could be considered a fifth loan phoneme.
2.6Morphophonemics: phonological rulesThere are several phonological rules.
Rule 1: Vowel deletion
Kamsá has no consecutive vowels within words. Whenever two vowels come together (over a
morpheme boundary), the first vowel is deleted. For example, when the allative marker -oj is
added to the noun txa ‘mountain’, /a/ in mountain is deleted.
txa + oj →txoj ‘to the mountain’
Rule 2: Vowel becomes glide
i→j/_V
If the vowel is /i/, however, the next following vowel is not deleted. Instead /i/ is a glide, /j/.
When bata has the allative marker -oj after the animacy marker -bi, the /i/ is not deleted.
bata + bj + oj → batabjoj ‘to the aunt’
Rule 3: Optional devoicing
When /b/ occurs before a voiceless consonant, it often becomes /f/ or /p/, although not always, as
seen above with [btʃend] ‘blue’, also pronounced as [ftʃe nd].
/ibs/ ‘tomorrow’ can be pronounced [ips]
Rule 4: Degemination
ʂ + ʂ →ʂ
When there are two identical consonants in a row, only one is pronounced. Thus when the first
person object marker ʂ- precedes the second person plural subject marker ʂmo- on a verb, it is
realized as ʂmo, not ʂʂmo-.","[58, 59, 60, 61]"
"295: Modifiers precede modified in NPs:
“A general characteristic of most Andean languages (including Aymaran and Quechuan)
is that modifiers must precede the modified in hierarchically organized noun phrases. In some
languages, however, adjectives follow the noun whereas in other modifiers precede it” (Adelaar
2008:26).
While determiners and numerals must precede their associated head noun, adjectives can
either precede or follow the head noun.
6: Few vowels, no tone, no nasality spread:
“Andean languages are said to lack a variety of phonological traits”, including many
vowels, tone, and nasality spread (Adelaar 2008:26).
Kamsá, like many Andean languages, lacks these features. It has no contrastive tones,
nasal vowels, or nasality spread, and it has more vowels than Quechuan or Aymaran languages
typically have.
7: Voiceless uvular stop:
Many Andean languages have a contrastive voiceless uvular stop (Adelaar 2008:27).
Kamsá does not have this feature.
8: No classifier systems:
“One of the most salient characteristics is again negative, namely the absence of
Amazonian-type classifier systems (cf. Derbyshire and Payne 1990). Such classifier systems,
which are largely based on distinctions of shape, are widely found in the pre-Andean Amazonian
region, where they are subject to borrowing and imitation. They are not found in the Andes”
(Adelaar 2008:28).
Kamsá diverges from the proposed Andean typological profile in having a large
class/classifier system, with nouns having class markers and modifiers agreeing with them.
9: No gender:
“In most Andean languages, including Aymaran, Quechuan and Araucanian, gender
distinctions are not expressed morphologically” (Adelaar 2008:28).","[42, 43]"

Another analysis is that j- is on all verbs, but when a verb is marked with ts- for
progressive or nd- for habitual, it is deleted because there are too many consonants together. If
this is the case, then j- would be a verb marker, and past would be the unmarked tense, with
everything else (future, habitual, present progressive, etc.) being marked.
4.4.3 Past, completed: tAs discussed in 4.2, the third person singular is marked with t- in the past. Thus, tomarks both third person singular and past. In (45a-b) the verb j-an ‘go’ is shown with different

"10An important concept in Kamsá is shinÿak ‘hearth’, the large fire kept in the traditional
house or outdoor kitchen. Many Kamsás see this word as being connected to the words in ‘fire’
and shinÿe ‘sun’, and thus see the three concepts as related. More pragmatically, the shinÿak is
used to make chicha, which needs to be cooked in a cauldron over a large fire, meaning it cannot
be made on a modern stove. In the past, people would make meals on the fire and sit around the
shinÿak, telling stories.
There are several aspects of Kamsá culture that seem to come from lowland groups,
namely yagé, the jaguar as a symbol, and maloca. The plants used to make yagé do not appear to
be native to Sibundoy, so the practice is presumably from lowlands groups, whose rainforest
environment contains the necessary plants. It is not clear how long yagé has been used by the
Kamsá, but it is of course possible that there has been a very long tradition of trade and cultural
transmission. It is also interesting to note that, despite living at a high altitude, the Kamsá do not
use coca, which is rather common among other Andean groups. It would be interesting to look
for Kamsá influence on lowland groups, such as the Siona and Kofán.
Taitas (‘male elders’) sometimes wear elaborate necklaces with beaded jaguars (called
‘tigers’) and artisans make jaguar masks. There is also a type of yagé called ‘jaguar’. The Kamsá
words for ‘jaguar’ and ‘tiger’ are borrowed for Spanish. Reichel-Dolmatoff (1975), known as the
father of Colombian anthropology, notes that many highland groups borrowed the symbol of the
jaguar from lowland groups. This is in part assumed because the species is not found in the
highlands, although it isn’t impossible that there were jaguars in the area. The maloca,
(traditional long house) also seems to be from lowland groups mainly because its design is suited
for hot climates. This is speculation on my part.
1.2.3Relationship to other languages / classification attempts
Kamsá is a language isolate. There have been several attempts to group it with otherlanguage families, mainly Chibchan, but there is no reliable evidence that it is related to other
languages. See Campbell 2012 for a survey of larger-scale though mostly unaccepted proposals
of distant genetic relationships involving languages in South America. There have also been
suggestions that it is related to the language of the Quillacinga, whose ancestral homeland is
around what is now the city of Pasto. Although the Quillacinga people still exist, their language11has been extinct for centuries and they now only speak Spanish. There are no records of what
their language was like. There are several theories about what language they spoke: Kamsá,
something related to Kamsá, something in the Chibchan family, or something in the Quechuan
family. It is of course impossible to classify their language, since there is no record of it.
Likewise, Kamsá could theoretically be related to whatever language was once spoken by the
Mocoa people (a group who once lived in the area of the current city of Mocoa), but their
language is also unknown to us. The extant languages geographically closest to Kamsá are: Inga
(Quechuan), Kofán (isolate), Siona (Tukano), Awa Pit (Barbacoan), and Koreguaje (Tukano).
Future research is needed to see if any of these languages have had lexical or structural
influences on Kamsá.
1.2.4Borrowing
Kamsá has a long tradition of lexical borrowed from both Spanish and Inga. Morerecently, as the language has come to be spoken less and less, it has become more and more
influenced by Spanish, both lexically and syntactically. This section focuses more on the older
borrowings, especially those forms that have been fully integrated into Kamsá phonotactics or
have undergone sound changes that have somewhat obscured their non-Kamsá etymologies. The
words considered in this section are—largely—considered by native speakers to be “Kamsá”
(regardless of their origins) and they are used commonly in traditional stories, ceremonial
speech, and other speech registers that may be considered “pure” or “traditional”. Thus, these
are—both etically (on the grounds of phonotactics and morphology) and emically (on the
grounds of speaker identification of Kamsá-ness)—fully integrated loanwords as opposed to
instances of code-switching or language loss.
One obvious semantic domain for borrowing includes vocabulary for fauna, flora,
cultural objects and concepts that did not exist before the arrival of the Spanish. Examples
include: ral ‘money’ (from Spanish real, the old Spanish currency), naranjabe ‘orange’ (from
Spanish naranja ‘orange’), and jatrabaja ‘work’ (from Spanish trabajar ‘work’). All three of
these words exhibit the borrowed phoneme /r/, which suggests that the forms are foreign.
Nevertheless, their integration into Kamsá can be shown both phonologically and
morphologically. First, ral ‘money’ has undergone a phonological reduction, from the disyllabic12form re.al to the current monosyllabic ral (the fact that the term real is no longer used in local
Colombian Spanish can obscure the word’s etymology). Second, the from naranjabe ‘orange’
shows a morphological change, having received the noun classifier associated with round
objects, -be (3.2.2). Finally, jatrabaja has undergone the phonological change of the loss of a
final consonant; furthermore, it reveals Kamsá verbal morphology by exhibiting the non-finite
verb marker j(a)- (4), as well as being able to receive TAM morphology.
Almost all conjunctions (10.2) in Kamsá are borrowed from Spanish, including: o ‘or’
(from Spanish o); i ‘and’ (from Spanish y); pero ‘but’ (from Spanish pero); porke ‘because’
(from Spanish porque); maske ‘although’ (from Spanish más que ‘more than’); and ni ‘neither,
nor’ (from Spanish ni). Other borrowed basic function-like words include mas ‘more’ (from
Spanish más); mejor ‘better’ (from Spanish mejor); and peor ‘bad’ (from Spanish peor ‘worse’).
These are all discussed in 10.2 and 9.4.
Because the Catholic missionaries were the only people speaking Spanish in Sibundoy
until the 1950s (Fabre 2001:2), much of the older Spanish vocabulary that has been borrowed
into Kamsá reflects the varieties of Spanish used by the them. Fabre states: “This explains why
the Spanish layer we can detect in Kamsá and Inga is so replete with quaintly old-fashioned
church Spanish” (Fabre 2001:2). Some examples are the following: parla ‘speak’ (from parlar, a
now obsolete Spanish word for ‘speak’, cf. standard hablar); ndeombre ‘truly’ (from Spanish de
hombre loosely, ‘by my word’); andela warda ‘God protect you’ (from Spanish dios le guarde,
‘God preserve you’), dioslepay ‘thank you’ (from (que) dios le pague ‘may God pay you’, cf.
standard gracias).
Along with vocabulary, Kamsá has borrowed some phonology from Spanish as well
(2.2.2.7). The most obvious loan phoneme is /r/, some examples of which were seen above.
Other examples include rat ‘bit, while’ (from Spanish rato ‘while’) and mor ‘now’ (from
Spanish ahora ‘now’ or, alternatively, from *mwa-hora ‘this hour’, from Kamsá mwa ‘that’ plus
Spanish hora ‘hour’).
Kamsá’s traditional phoneme inventory also lacked a plain (non-prenasalized) voiced
alveolar /d/, and many older Spanish words that contained /d/ have been borrowed into Kamsá
with either /nd/ or /ndʒ/ (written in orthography used here as <nd> and <nÿ>, respectively).
Examples of Spanish words with *d that have been borrowed with phonological changes into13Kamsá are: nÿios or ndios or nÿios̈ ‘god’ (from Spanish dios ‘god’); ndeolpe ‘suddenly’ from de
golpe ‘suddenly’; and nderado ‘maybe’ possibly from *de raro.
Many words borrowed from Spanish have changed in meaning, sometimes even
functioning as different parts of speech in Kamsá than in Spanish. Loanwords are pointed out
throughout the dissertation as well as their change in meaning and/or part of speech. Two brief
examples of loanwords that have taken on new meaning in Kamsá are ora ‘when’ and parej
‘with’. First, ora ‘when’ comes from the Spanish nouns hora ‘hour, time, when’, but has become
a subordinator for temporal clauses, thus shifting both in meaning and in function (10.3.3).
Similarly, parej ‘with’ from the Spanish adjective parejo ‘equal to, level with, similar to’
functions in Kamsá as a preposition, not as a adjective.
Many Spanish words have found new meanings in ceremonial speech, the register of
Kamsá that is used for many formal situations, such as greetings in the cabildo, and for Catholic
sacraments, such as baptisms and confirmations. Haydee Seijas (1969:65), who conducted
anthropological fieldwork in Sibundoy in the 1960s, refers to this type of speech as the lengua de
los antiguos or “relación speech”. She reports that most people are not fluent in this speech,
which consists of set words and phrases and are used by the governor in his Sunday address to
the Kamsá people and by others as a means of showing politeness. The following example, the
beginning of a formal greeting, shows the Spanish influence, with three out of the four words
coming from Spanish (the possessive pronoun ats̈be ‘my’ is the only fully native Kamsá word).
The verb, although derived from Spanish, exhibits Kamsá verbal morphology:
(1)Primermente ats̈be dios chas̈pasentsia …
primermente ats̈-be
dios cha-s̈-pasentsia
first
1SG-GEN
god
COND-1SG-forgive
‘First may god forgive me…’ (Chindoy 28:5) (primermente from Spanish primeramente
‘firstly’, dios from Spanish dios ‘God’, pasentsia from Spanish paciencia ‘patience’)
Much of the ‘formal’ speech relates to the Catholic church, which we might expect tohave a lot of Spanish not because it’s formal but because it involves Catholic rituals and
ceremonies, where they borrowed the words along with the rituals. There is also non-religious
formal speech that uses Spanish, such as the petitioning for a girlfriend, mentioned above.
In addition to lexical borrowing, Kamsá has perhaps undergone structural changes under
influence from Spanish and Inga. Since Kamsá has no known relatives and since no early14documents representing the language are known, it is impossible to say with any certainty what
structural traits (if any) are due to influence from other languages. That said, it is possible that
the basic word order in Kamsá is becoming more SVO (due to influence from Spanish), and that
there is a trend toward using fewer adjectival verbs or null-copular constructions for predicate
adjectives, with a preference instead for copula-plus-adjective constructions (as in Spanish).
Fabre (Fabre 2001:3) suggests another influence from Spanish:
the redundant use of the same classifier, even with no intervening word between them,
strongly reminds of the Spanish number and gender agreement rules between the same two
parts of speech and sets Kamsá apart from classifier languages of Western Amazonia, where
classifiers are mostly used as an anaphoric device, there being no need of repeating the noun
to which they refer.
Kamsá and Inga have been in contact for at least five centuries. In the past, many Kamsá and
Inga were multilingual, speaking each other’s languages as well as Spanish. Today there are
older Kamsá (over 60) who know some Inga, and they often say that their fathers (and
sometimes mothers) were fluent in Inga. Borrowing from Inga needs to be investigated further,
but here I provide a few examples of Inga words in Kamsá. Some examples of Kamsá words that
Chindoy says are borrowed from Inga are as follows (the Kamsá and the Inga words have the
same meaning unless otherwise noted):
chisiajta ‘afternoon, all day’ < chisya
choros̈ ‘snail’ < churu
pats ‘one hundred’ < patsa
taytá ‘father’ < tayta
wambra ‘child’ < wampra;
wata ‘year’ < wata
yap(a) ‘a lot, very, much’ < yapa ‘a lot, very, much’.
Fabre suggests that the Kamsá’s determiner ch could be borrowed from Inga as well
because it has a cognate in most Quechuan languages (2001:3).
Words borrowed from Spanish and Inga have Kamsá morphology. Thus chagllufja ‘thin
cane or rod to measure work or construction of houses’ which comes from Inga chacla has the
Kamsá classifier -fja used for long, thin, things. The example of naranja-be ‘orange’ was seen
above, with -be ‘round-objects classifier. It should be noted that Kamsá classifiers are not
separable from the word. They are part of the root. Borrowed words may reflect other15morphological affixation as well, as for example trabajayá ‘worker’ which has the agentive -yá
on the Spanish-derived trabaja (from trabajar ‘to work’). The following sentence shows Kamsá
morphology on two verbs borrowed from Spanish: jakwenta ‘tell’ from contar and japasa
‘happen’ from pasar.

‘What you’re telling me really happened (to me).’ (Chindoy 80:28)1.2.5Name of the language
Kamsá is referred to variously in the literature by the following names: Camënts̈á,Camëntsëá, Camëntxá, Camsa, Camsá, Coche, Kamemtxa, Kamentsá, Kamëntsa, Kamënts̈á,
Kamsa, Kamsá, Kamse, Kamtsá, Mocoa, Sibundoy, and Sibundoy-Gaché. Other than the terms
Coche, Sibundoy, and Mocoa, these are all variants of Kamsá. The Kamsá people tend to
pronounce the name of their language as Kamënts̈á (in IPA [kamɨnˈtʂa]) or Kamënchá (in IPA
[kamɨnˈtʃa]). One commonly repeated etymology is from ka- (intensifier) and mwents̈ ‘here’,
meaning ‘right here’. It is not clear, however, what sound changes would have generated mënts̈á
from *mwents̈, with the labial glide *w being elided, and the front vowel *e becoming the central
vowel ë. The final -á, however, could perhaps be explained as a nominalizing suffix. Because
most English- and Spanish-language sources have referred to the language as either Kamsá or
Camsá, I have chosen to use that name as well, preferring <K> to <C> to match the overall
orthography used within this grammatical description (2.7). Most Kamsá seem to write
Kamënts̈á or Camënts̈á for the language.
Of the unrelated names that have been used to refer to the language, the name Sibundoy
derives simply from the location (town, municipality, and valley) where Kamsá is spoken. (In
some sources, the term Sibundoy is used to refer to the Kamsá and the Inga together.) It is
possible that the term Mocoa actually refers to a different tribe that may or may not have spoken
a different language. Mocoa is mentioned in some historical texts as being the name of a lowland
people, the people who perhaps lived where the city of Mocoa is currently located, on the edge
of the Amazon in the Putumayo department of Colombia. The source of the term Coche is
unclear as is the source of Gaché in Sibundoy-Gaché.
161.3Language ecology and language vitality
Kamsá is a severely endangered language based on UNESCO’s factors and the LEI(Language Endangerment Index). I estimate that there were fewer than 500 fluent speakers of
Kamsá in 2012, based on the current age of fluent speakers and the census data for different age
groups. My personal observation is that there are few, if any, fluent speakers of Kamsá younger
than 60 years old. Many ethnic Kamsás between the ages of 40 and 60 are semi-speakers (in that
they are able to have basic conversations and have good comprehension of fluent speech, but are
not themselves fluent speakers), but it is not known how many there are. According to the DANE
(National Administrative Department of Statistics) census in 2012, there were 499 Kamsá who
were 61 or older (2012). Thus, considering that only ethnic Kamsás older than 60 years old are
fluent speakers, I estimate that the speaker number is less than 500. This method of counting
speakers is problematic for several reasons. First, the most recent census was in 2012 (although
now, in 2018, they are conducting a census so there will be better numbers next year). Second,
the age groups in the census include all people 25-60, then those over 60. There isn’t a more
nuanced count of older people.
ONIC (Organizacion Nacional Indigena de Colombia, ‘National Indigenous
Organization of Colombia’) lists an ethnic population of 4,773 (2005). Thus, just slightly over 10
percent of the ethnic Kamsá population are fluent speakers of the language.
Ethnologue (2018 ??) claims that Kamsá has 4,000 speakers out of an ethnic population
of 4,770 and classifies Kamsá as “level 5: developing”, according to its EGIDS schema.
UNESCO claims 3,500 speakers and says that the language is definitely endangered (3 on its
scale) The Endangered Language Catalogue gives 4773 speakers, based on Crevels 2012.
1.3.1UNESCO’s nine factors
UNESCO uses nine factors to determine the endangerment of a language, most of whichare graded on a scale from 0 (“extinct” to 5 (“safe”). Following this system, I would classify
Kamsá as 2 (“severely endangered”). UNESCO, however, lists Kamsá as 3 “definitely
endangered”. The following is a description of how Kamsá fares according to each of the nine
UNESCO factors.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

xFigure 2.2: Kamsá consonants (in the IPA)
There are some unusual characteristics of Kamsa’s consonant inventory. First, for the
voiced stops, there is a prenasalized voiced velar stop /ᵑɡ/, but no non-prenasalized voiced velar
stop (no */ɡ/, aside from in loans from Spanish). Similarly, there is a prenasalized voiced
alveolar stop, / ⁿd/, but no non-prenasalized voiced velar stop (no */d/, aside from in loans from
Spanish). Finally, there is a prenasalized voiced palato-alveolar affricate /ⁿdʒ/, again without the
non-prenasalized counterpart (no */dʒ/). There is a voiced bilabial stop /b/, but no voiceless
bilabial stop (no */p/, aside from in relatively recent loans from Spanish); rather, the voiceless
bilabial stop [p] is an allophone of the voiced stop, /b/, as is the labiodental fricative [f].
Another interesting fact about Kamsá’s phonemic inventory is its large number of
fricatives and affricates. The language has voiceless alveolar, retroflex, palato-alveolar, and velar
fricatives, as well as voiceless alveolar and retroflex affricates and both voiced and voiceless
palato-alveolar affricates; furthermore, the single labial obstruent /b/ can be realized as the
voiceless labio-dental fricative [f].
41Finally, there are several sounds that are phonemic but extremely rare, including the
palatal lateral approximant /ʎ/ which is maybe a loan from Spanish and the alveolar lateral
approximant /l/, which could also possibly be a loan phoneme..
2.2.2.1 Voiceless stops /t, k/
Kamsá has two voiceless stops, /t/ and /k/, which contrast with each other. They can
occur word initially before /a/ or before /o/, as seen below, as well as in other environments.
katʃ [intensifier]
kotʃaʂ ‘chest’tamo ‘salt’
tobiaʂ ‘girl’Both /t/ and /k/ can be word final, as seen below.
bakoftak ‘with the uncle’katʂat ‘brother’2.2.2.2 Voiced stops /b, ⁿd, /ᵑɡ/
The voiced stops are /b/, /ⁿd/, and /ᵑɡ/. Whereas the alveolar and velar voiced stops are
prenasalized, the bilabial voiced stop is not. The prenasalized stops /ⁿd/ and /ᵑɡ/ contrast with
each other, as seen in the following words.
ⁿdmwa ‘who’
ⁿdwawenan [deaf]ᵑɡmenan ‘pity’
ᵑɡwɨʂɨʂbe ‘nose’The (non-prenasalized) voiced bilabial stop /b/ also contrasts with the two other voiced stops, ⁿd
and ᵑɡ, as seen below.
bokoj ‘chicha’
baja ‘animal, beast’ⁿdoka ‘nothing’
ⁿdajek ‘why?’bwetʃtsanuko ‘hat’
xobweyan ‘offend’ᵑɡwetʃe ‘mud’
xoᵑɡwefxwan ‘fly’42As mentioned, the voiced bilabial stop /b/ exhibits the allophones [b], [p], and [f]. As
discussed in Section (2.5) below, [p] is becoming (or has become) a phoneme as well, due to
loan words in the language.
The allophone [f] occurs when /b/ followed by a voiceless consonant, i.e.:
/b/ → [f ] / [-voice] (optional?)
The form [b] is always found when followed by a vowel or the labial-velar approximant
/w/, as in basa ‘small’ or bwatʃana ‘visitor’ (i.e., never *fasa or *fwatʃana). It is only a
following voiceless consonant that can condition the change of /b/ to [f], as in the word fʃants
‘land’ and fxants ‘white’, in which the following voiceless fricative conditions the [f]. Voiceless
stops also condition b → f, as seen in the word ften ‘bland’.
For at least some words, however, there may be free variation—for example, the word
[ftʃend] ‘blue’ can also be pronounced [btʃe nd].
2.2.2.3 The prenasalized voiced palato-alveolar affricate /ⁿdʒ/
There is no oral equivalent /dʒ/. It can occur word initially as seen in with ⁿdʒets ‘all’ and
the particle ⁿdʒa. It can come after vowels as seen in iⁿdʒe ‘other’, kaⁿdʒe ‘one’, and xaⁿdʒan
‘examine’
ⁿdʒets ‘all’
ⁿdʒa ‘particle’
iⁿdʒe ‘other’
kaⁿdʒe ‘one’
xaⁿdʒan ‘examine’
2.2.2.4 Nasals /m, n, ɲ/
There are three nasals in Kamsá, a bilabial nasal /m/, an alveolar nasal, /n/, and a palatal
nasal /ɲ/. They may all occur word-finally, as in the following:
ⁿdoɲ ‘no’jendon ‘squirrel’tbom ‘a lot’432.2.2.5 Liquids
There are a few sounds (namely liquids) that seem to be phonemic because they are not
predictable, but they are extremely rare: the palatal lateral approximant /ʎ/, the alveolar lateral
approximant /l/, and the alveolar tap /r/. The tap is certainly borrowed from Spanish (see 2.2.2.7),
and the two lateral approximants may be as well.
An example of a word containing the palatal lateral approximant is in maʎaxt ‘a lot’. An
example with the alveolar lateral approximant is lemp ‘all’. Neither sound can be predicted by
the environment, with /ʎ/ being intervocalic and /l/ being at the start of a word followed by the
vowel /e/.
2.2.2.6 Voiceless fricatives and affricates /s, ts, ʂ, tʂ, ʃ, tʃ x/
The voiceless fricatives (/s/, /ʂ/, and /ʃ/) and their corresponding voiceless affricates (/ts/,
/tʂ/, and /tʃ) all have (almost) the same exact distribution, along with the voiceless velar fricative
/x/, which has no affricate counterpart. (There are no voiced fricatives in Kamsá). These seven
voiceless fricatives and affricates can all appear word initially, as seen below. In each example,
the fricative or affricate is immediately followed by the vowel /e/.
sebja ‘extreme point’
tsetʂan ‘pain’
ʂeʂa ‘corn plant’
tʂematʂ ‘hominy’
ʃem ‘woman
tʃentʂ ‘here’
xenanufxa ‘rod’
These consonants can also all occur word initially before /a/, as in the following words.
saka ‘thus’
tsafjoj ‘kitchen’
ʂatʃénaka ‘crying’
tʂaba good’
ʃatʃna ‘five’
tʃa ‘he, she’
xaʃxaᵑɡwá ‘arrive’44The two voiceless velar consonants /k/ and /x/ contrast, occurring word initially before /a/
and /e/, as seen below.
xan ‘go’
xenanufxa ‘tool for corn’katʃ [intensifier]
keʂ ‘dog’2.2.2.7 Borrowed phones /d, ɡ, r/, and maybe /p/
Kamsa has borrowed /d/, /ɡ/, /r/, and maybe /p/ from Spanish.
/d/
deombre ‘truly’ (from Spanish de hombre ‘of man’)
dweɲ ‘owner’ (from Spanish dueño [dweɲo] ‘owner’)
/r/
ral ‘money’ (from Spanish real)
rat ‘short amount of time’ (from Spanish rato)
/p/
plautufxa ‘flute’ (from Spanish flauta)
podesk ‘ugly’ (maybe from Spanish feo)
pwerte ‘strongly’ (from Spanish fuerte)
It’s interesting that /f/ gets borrowed as /p/, especially since /p/ can get (or did get)
borrowed as /b/ (e.g., bastok ‘Pasto’). This could give you information about rules for the
allophones of /b/. It would be interesting to investigate whether newer borrowings of /f/ from
Spanish also become /p/ in Kamsá.
2.3Syllables structure
Kamsá’s syllable structure permits multiple (up to three) consonants in an onset or codaand almost any combination of consonants. More research is needed to see if they follow the
sonority hierarchy. There are phonological processes that occur when prefixes, suffixes, and
clitics are added to words.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"

9.3.5Other negative words
Negation can be shown by negative pronouns without the use of ndoñ or tonday. Twoexamples are ndoká ‘nothing’ and ndokena ‘no one’. In (13a) ndoká ‘nothing’ is used with the
verb jayan which is marked with n- to show that it is negative, meaning ‘saying nothing’. In
(13b) it is used with nÿa for emphasis in the command. In (13c) the verb j-amnan ‘to be’ has
negative morphology. In (13d) ndokna ‘no one’ shows that there was nothing left of two images.
It has the dual marker -ta because it is of the two images and it isn’t clear why it is ndokna ‘no
one’ instead of ndoká ‘nothing’.

9.3.6Word order: ndoñ
ndoñ usually goes directly before the verb, as in most of the examples above. It tends togo at the beginning of the verb phrase. Objects come after ndoñ and before the verb, as seen in
(14a) where tsës̈ey ‘yellow’ is the object of the verb. Note that tsës̈ey has the class marker -be for
round things to agree with egg, which is implied by the verb. In (14b) the adjective bëts ‘big’
precedes the verb, with ndoñ preceding it. In (14c) ndoñ precedes the adverb bien ‘well’ and in
(14d) ndoñ precedes the adverb chka ‘like that’. Although ndoñ usually comes before the verb
phrase, it can follow the verb as well, as seen in (14e). In (14f), there is a common expression,
with ndoñ at the end of the phrase.

"The subject marker and object marker, if there is one, precede the future marker. The aspect
marker ts- can follow chan-, as can j-, but it is not clear what the difference is. As mentioned in
4.2 Subject Marking, the first person singular is unmarked in the future and conditional whereas
the third person singular is marked with i- in the future and conditional.
In (49a) and (49c), the future is shown with chan + ts and the verb root. In (49b) japten
‘rain’ is repeated from above in the present progressive tense for comparison. In (49d-g) the
future is shown with chan- and the verb root, including the j-. In (49d) the verb jan ‘go’ is
marked simply with chan- because first person singular is zero marked in the future. Similarly in
(49e) j-akwenta ‘tell’ is only marked with chan-. In (49f), j-atrabaja is marked with i-chan- for
third singular. In (49g) both verbs j-ashjango ‘arrive’ and j-atay ‘spend the night’ are marked
with the third person dual marker bo- and the future chan-. Note that j-akenta ‘tell’ and jatrabaja ‘work’ are both loanwords from Spanish, from contar ‘tell’ and trabajar ‘work’. They
have the same verbal morphology as native words.

4.4.6Conditional/speculative: chao- and tayThe prefixes chao- and tay- mark the conditional. chao- seems related to chan- and it ispossible that ch- is a separate morpheme, with ao- and an- being different morphemes.When
chao- is used, there is no person or number marking. The vowel sequence ao- in chao- is suspect
as it is the only such vowel sequence in the language.
In (50a) the verb j-amn-an ‘be’ is marked with chao- to show uncertainty. The clause also
has the particle ndok which can mean ‘maybe’. In (50b) the verbs are marked with chao- to show
a possible occurrence. In (50c), chao- also shows a possibility.

4.4.7Distant past: yeThe distant past is used in some Kamsá stories. It is never used in speech (at least in mydata). It is only used for third person, probably for pragmatic reasons, i.e. that it is only for very
distant past before a speaker or hearer was born. It is formed with i- which becomes y- before
vowels. Thus, for third person singular, distant past is ye- or yo- while for plural and dual it is ibefore the usual plural marker mo- or dual marker bo-, or simple mo- or bo- without i-.
In (52a) and (52b), the verbs j-an ‘go’ and j-ay-an ‘say’ have the prefix ye- to show
distant past for a third singular subject. In (52c) and (52d), from the Kamsá Bible, Jesus is telling
a parable and the verbs all have the prefix yo- for distant past. It is not clear what the difference
between ye- and yo- is, if any, but it is possible that yo- also functions as a passive marker as
125discussed in the next section. It seems like ye- is ‘narrative past’ that is now archaic. It appears in
older texts, in Chindoy, the Bible, and McDowell but I do not have it in any of my own texts.
The function of yo- is less clear. It could be a composite of the distant past y- with the o- that is
in many other person/tense morphemes. It could also be a composite of the third singular i- with
o-.

(Chindoy 107:1)4.4.8Passive?: yoThere is a prefix yo- which is perhaps a passive or impersonal marker. It is not commonand more research is needed to determine its function, but a few examples are provided here.
In (55a) yo- is on the verb jenÿenan ‘find’. Other morphology on the verb is different, as
well. The meaning seems to be passive. Although yo- can be a distant past marker, here it is not,
because it is found in dialogue. The other examples are even less clearly passive. In (55b), it is
on the verb j-opodenan ‘be able’ (from Spanish poder ‘be able’). Note that there is a native
Kamsa word for ‘be able’, as well, and it is possible that this word has a slightly different
meaning. In (55c), the verb could be distant past, with yo- marking distant past, or it could be a
different construction. In (55d), the subject is plural, and the verb is j-onan ‘feel’.

4.5Evidentiality: n- and j- or ØThere is a two-way evidentiality system: n- for known information and j- or Ø- forunknown information. More research is needed to determine if the form of the unknown
evidential marker is j- or Ø- because it always appears with verbalizer j- and thus could be j- + j. The evidential marker comes after the person markers and before the aspect markers. There are
several morphophonemic rules with these evidential markers, discussed below.
The marker for something known is n-. It is often used in the recent past, and never used
in the distant past11. It is almost always used in first person singular (not necessarily plural,
because first person plural could mean ‘we, the Kamsás’).
The marker for something not known is j- or Ø-. Jamioy Muchavisoy describes the
evidential system as being n- for ‘close’ and j-12 for removed (1999). In (56a), the j- shows that
the speaker is has distance from responsibility, while in (56b) the speaker is closer.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141]"
"20Factor 2: Scale of absolute number of speakers.
Endangered
“100–999 speakers” (Lee and Van Way 2016:281)
Kamsá has about 500 speakers.
Factor 3:Scale of speaker number trends
Severely Endangered (4)
“Less than half of the community speaks the language, and speaker numbers are
decreasing at an accelerated pace.” (Lee and Van Way 2016:283)
Given that only older people speak the language, it is definitely less than half.
Factor 4: Domains of use
Severely Endangered (4)
“Used mainly just in the home and/or with family, and may not be the primary language
even in these domains for many community members.” (Lee and Van Way 2016:285)
Kamsá is used for rituals and ceremonies, and also in the home between older people.
Kamsá thus comes out as a 4 “severely endagered” on the LEI scale of ELCat.
1.3.3Language attitudes
My impression is that people view Kamsá positively; they like the language and they feela strong sense of identity with the culture and see the language as inextricably linked to the
culture. In addition to the cultural value in knowing the language, there are even economic
rewards, as there are tests within Colombia for certain university scholarships for indigenous
people that require knowledge of the language. The scholarships seem to be run by the cabildo in
conjunction with the Colombian government. The colonial and missionizing history, however,
tell a different story and these positive feelings about the language and culture are likely a recent
phenomenon. The Capuchin monks were harsh and looked down on the Kamsá language being
spoken.","[33, 34]"
"17Factor 1: Intergenerational Language Transmission;
Severely endangered (2):
“The language is spoken only by grandparents and older generations; while the parent
generation may still understand the language, they typically do not speak it to their children.”
(UNESCO 2003:8)
Kamsá is mainly spoken by people older than 60, and the people in their 40s who
understand some of the language do not typically speak it to their children.
Factor 2: Absolute Number of Speakers;
500
“It is impossible to establish a hard and fast rule for interpreting absolute numbers, but a
small speech community is always at risk.” (UNESCO 2003:8)
With perhaps fewer than 500 speakers, Kamsá would, by practically any measure, be
considered a small speech community.
Factor 3: Proportion of Speakers within the Total Population;
Severely endangered (2):
“A minority speak the language.” (UNESCO 2003:8)
Based on my calculations, about 500 of 4,773 speak the language, slightly more than 10
percent.
Factor 4: Trends in Existing Language Domains;
Limited or formal domains (2):
“The non-dominant language is used only in highly formal domains, as especially in
ritual and administration. The language may also still be used at the community centre, at
festivals, and at ceremonial occasions where these older members of the community have a
chance to meet. The limited domain may also include homes where grandparents and other older
extended family members reside, and other traditional gathering places of the elderly. Many
people can understand the language but cannot speak it.” (UNESCO 2003:8)18Spanish is definitely the dominant language for most domains, but Kamsá is used in the
cabildo, at festivals, and ceremonials. Also, in more domestic settings, sometimes older people
use Kamsá with one other.
Factor 5: Response to New Domains and Media;
Coping (2):
“The language is used in some new domains.” (UNESCO 2003:8)
There are some websites, cell-phone apps, and short videos that use Kamsá, but most new
domains encountered by community members (e.g., television, social media websites) are
entirely in Spanish.
Factor 6: Materials for Language Education and Literacy;
Grade (3):
“Written materials exist and children may be exposed to the written form at school.
Literacy is not promoted through print media. Writing in the language is not used in
administration.” (UNESCO 2003:8)
For this factor, Kamsá receives a higher rating. There are materials in the language:
books, pedagogical materials, websites, apps, and so on, and children that attend the bilingual
school do have some literacy in the language. They are most unable, however, to speak the
language.
Factor 7: Governmental and Institutional Language Attitudes And Policies, Including Official
Status and Use ;
Differentiated support (4):
“Non-dominant languages are explicitly protected by the government, but there are clear
differences in the contexts in which the dominant/official language(s) and non-dominant
(protected) language(s) are used. The government encourages ethnolinguistic groups to maintain
and use their languages, most often in private domains (as the home language), rather than in
public domains (e.g. in schools). Some of the domains of non-dominant language use enjoy high
prestige (e.g. at ceremonial occasions).” (UNESCO 2003:8)19For this factor, as well, Kamsá has a higher rating. Colombia’s constitution of 1991
protects all indigenous languages. The Kamsá, and all other recognized indigenous languages,
legally have a right to use and preserve their languages. The Colombian constitution has also
been translated into Kamsá. Thus, it does have the state support, at least in name.
Factor 8: Community Members’ Attitudes toward Their Own Language;
Grade (4):
“Most members support language maintenance.” (UNESCO 2003:8)
Most Kamsás seem in favor of maintaining the language, at least in theory. They are
happy that there is a bilingual school and they want to see the language maintained.
Factor 9: Amount and Quality of Documentation;
Fragmentary (2):
“There are some grammatical sketches, word-lists, and texts useful for limited linguistic
research but with inadequate coverage. Audio and video recordings may exist in varying quality,
with or without any annotation.” (UNESCO 2003:8)
There is not much linguistic documentation, although, as mentioned above, there are a
decent number of books, websites, and so on, in the language. It is hoped that this reference
grammar will serve as another contribution to the documentation and description of the language.
1.3.2LEI
Here I assess Kamsa's endangerment using the Language Endangerment Index (LEI)from the Catalogue of Endangered Languages (ELCat).
Factor 1: Intergenerational transmission
Severely Endangered (4)
“Many of the grandparent generation speak the language, but the younger people
generally do not” (Lee and Van Way 2016:281).
Most Kamsá older than 60 speak the language, but there are few fluent speakers younger than
that.","[30, 31, 32, 33]"

Phrase-level syntax
8.1Introduction
This chapter discusses phrase-level syntax in Kamsá. A phrase may be considered a set ofone or more words functioning together as a syntactic unit, a unit usually smaller than (or a
constituent of) a clause. A phrase consists minimally of a single word, but more often contains
multiple words. In Kamsá, there are noun phrases (8.2), verb phrases, (8.3), postpositional
phrases (9.4), and prepositional phrases (8.5). Although prepositional phrases only occur with
Spanish loan words, they are very common in the language. There are some phrase-level clitics,
including the topic marker =na which occurs at the end of a noun phrase (8.2.3.2) and case
marking clitics at the end of noun phrases (8.2.3.1). Case marking is discussed further in (3.3.3).
8.2Noun phrases
A noun phrase consists minimally of a noun (common or proper), pronoun (personal orindefinite), substantive determiner (demonstrative: ch ‘the’; kem ‘that’; mwa ‘that’ or inÿe
‘other’, all functioning as a noun ) or substantive numeral (number functioning as a noun). Noun
phrases can include other constituents, such as determiners, adjectives, and prenominal numerals.
They also have case markers, which tend to go on the noun but can also occur at the end of the
entire NP or on multiple constituents in the NP, namely the noun and an adjective that agrees
with the noun. Some constituents of an NP can exhibit overt agreement with the head noun,
indexing the same semantic case and noun class or reflecting the same evaluative suffix as the
noun. Adjectives have class suffixes that agree with their nouns. Additionally, determiners, some
pronouns, and numerals in certain environments bear class suffixes that agree with the classes of
their referents, namely when they follow the noun or when they are in a different NP from the
noun that they agree with, as discussed in 6.3. Furthermore, a number of NP constituents are
marked with evaluative suffixes when they follow or are used substantively: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, determiners, and numerals, both within a noun phrase or across noun phrases (see1933.3.2 for evaluatives). Sometimes these constituents will have evaluative suffixes when they
precede a noun, but generally not.
Determiners and numerals always precede the heads of noun phrases, with determiners
preceding numerals. Adjectives generally follow the noun, but due to the free word order of
Kamsá they can sometimes precede the noun. There seems to be no appreciable difference in
meaning. Possessors always precede the noun.
Thus, the order of constituents in a NP is as follows:
[determiner] [possessor] [numeral] [adjective] [noun] [adjective] [adjective]
8.2.1Heads of noun phrases
The head of a noun phrase is often a noun, but can also be a non-archetypical nominal,such as substantive adjectives, personal pronouns, numerals, and determiners (used
substantively). Numbers and determiners always precede the noun, whereas adjectives can
precede or follow the noun.
If a personal pronoun is the head of the noun phrase, then no other constituents are
permitted. However, the pronoun can exhibit case marking and/or bear an evaluative suffix, with
the case marking always at the end of the noun phrase. Because indefinite pronouns do not show
up frequently in my corpus it is not clear if there can be other constituents in a noun phrase
headed by an indefinite pronoun or what suffixes and clitics can be marked. Two determiners,
the demonstrative kem ‘this, that’ and inÿe ‘other’ can also be heads of NPs when used
substantively. The definite article ch can also stand alone as an NP, but it is more common for
the third person singular pronoun cha, to serve as the entire NP, (8.2.1.2). Determiners are
discussed in 5.4 but here are simply defined as words that show definiteness and/or specificity
and precede the noun (as opposed to adjectives which can precede or follow the noun).
The following subsections detail the use of various word categories as heads of NPs.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"

3.3.3Noun cases
The nominal system of Kamsá is somewhere along the spectrum between having casesuffixes versus postpositions. In this section, I first outline the case system, showing each of the
cases and postpositions and their allomorphs, and giving examples of some of the uses of each
case and postposition. Then I discuss the distribution of each case and postposition, showing
whether it can occur with common nouns (both animate and inanimate where possible), proper
nouns, pronouns, and loans words. Many cases are different for animate nouns and inanimate
nouns: namely, animate nouns have the suffix -bi preceding the case marker whereas inanimate
nouns do not. Also, there are some cases which do not seem to be possible semantically with
proper nouns or pronouns (such as the instrumental) and others that are not possible with
inanimate nouns (such as the comitative). This will become apparent with each case that has this
distinction and will be discussed further. At the end of this section, I give evidence for why
some things are actual cases whereas other things seem to be postpositions.","[83, 84]"

aFigure 4.2 Person marking prefixes on verbs
4.3.1First person singular subject, second person object: k-boFirst person singular subject and second person object is shown on the verb as k-bo-, withk- marking the object and bo- marking the subject. Note that the first person singular subject106marker is usually së- whereas bo- is the dual marker. Thus, when the object is second person, the
first person subject marker changes to bo-, which is also the dual marker.
An alternative analysis is that it is k-b-o- and with o- marking transitivity.
In the following examples, the subject is first person singular and the object is second
person singular. The prefix for the second person object k- is the first prefix on the verb,
followed by bo- which here marks first person singular.
In (23a) ‘I am looking at you’ there are no independent subject or object pronouns in the
clause, but k- marks the second person object and bo- marks the first person subject. In (23b) the
dual marker bo- is shown for comparison; the verb jochashjajwa ‘rest on a patio’ (from chashjan
‘patio’) has the dual marker bo- to agree with the subject (which is not expressed), a couple.
In (23c), the object is also shown by the overt independent pronoun ak ‘you singular’.
Note that there is no difference between subject and object independent pronouns; ak is the
second singular pronoun, both for subjects and objects. In (23d), the sentence is the same as
(23c) but without the second person singular independent pronoun ak. In (23e) the verb is in the
future, which is zero marked in the first person singular when there is not an object marker as
seen in (23f) for comparison, where the verb jan ‘go’ is first person singular future, with the first
person singular marking null and an oblique ak-abtak ‘with you’. (23g) provides another
example of the first person singular subject and second person plural object in the future. Note
that j-wasta-n ‘follow, accompany’ j-wakmeya-n ‘follow, chase’ are transitive, whereas jan ‘go’
is not. Thus in (23f) the second person ak ‘you’ is in an oblique role and not marked on the verb,
whereas in (23e) and (23g) the second person is marked on the verb with k-.

4.3.2First person singular subject, third person singular object: sëWhen the subject is first person singular and the object is third person singular, only thefirst person singular subject is indexed overtly on the verb. The object is not marked overtly on

and the object is tsjan ‘guinea pig’; in (24b) the subject is first person singular and the object is
animate, enuta ‘friend’. In (24c) an intransitive verb is shown for comparison.

4.3.3Second singular subject, first singular object: s̈-koWhen the subject is second person singular, and the object is first person singular, thefirst person object marker s̈- is the first prefix on the verb, followed by the second person subject
marker ko-. In (25a) the first person object marker s̈- is the first prefix on the verb, followed by
the second person subject marker ko-. (25b) shows the same ordering, with both the first person
object marker s̈- and the second person subject marker ko- preceding the evidential marker nand the progressive marker ts-. In (25c) it is the same, but the object, the first person singular
pronoun ats̈ is in the clause. Note that when there is a first person subject with a second person
object, the subject marker on the verb is dual, whereas when there is a second person subject
with a first person object, it is simply the second person singular subject marker, not dual.

only ones that are not indexed on the verb when the object is first or second person; all other
subjects are indexed. (27c) shows a causative construction, where the agent is third person
singular and the object is first person singular. As discussed in 10.5, causatives are formed by
putting the object pronoun on the verb.

4.3.8Third plural subject, first object: s̈-moWhen a verb has a third person plural subject and a first-person singular object, the verbhas the prefixes s̈- for first person object and mo- for third person subject. In (31a) the verb jakmen ‘chase’ has the prefixes s̈- and mo- to mean ‘they chase me’. In (31b) the verb has two
objects, the first person singular and pavor ‘favor’.
This combination is identical to the prefix for second person singular subject s̈mo- and to
the morphemes for first person object and imperative, s̈- and mo- respectively, and to the
combination of first person singular object and second person plural subject s̈- and s̈mo-, which
become s̈mo- (not s̈s̈mo- or s̈ës̈mo-, which can be explained by a phonological rule that doesn’t
allow s̈ and s̈ next to each other. ).

second person object marker k- and the plural subject marker mo-, all talking about different
creatures (ants, wasps, and bees) biting/stinging the listener. Note that these examples are
problematic because the verb kind of has two patients, both the second person pronoun and the

"Whether this is the same j- as the one at the beginning of an infinitive is unclear. Both are

Uninflected verbs can take two forms:

j-root-am: jam ‘in order to go’, j-abwamiy-am ‘in order to buy’
Verbs with prefix j- and suffix -an are the citation form, and the complement for other
verbs that take complements. j- and -am show purpose. In (43a) the verb j-abwamiy-an ‘buy’ is
the complement of jobenan ‘be able’ and in (43b) j-abwamiy-am is a purpose clause. -am is also
the benefactive marker for nouns as seen in (43c) with bëng-bi-am ‘for us’, where bi- is used on

"61.2.2Culture
The Kamsá people traditionally grow their own food in large gardens 2 (known as chagrasin Colombian Spanish and jajañ in Kamsá). Many families possess their own jajañ, containing
many different types of plants and trees. Often they work together in their gardens: the verb
meaning ‘help one another in the garden’ is j-en-abwatambay-an. In the jajañ, they grow corn
(maize), beans, potatoes, yuca (cassava, sweet manioc), collard greens, squash, chili peppers,
achira (arrowroot), tomate de árbol (‘tree tomato’), lulo (Solanum quitoense), and chilacuán
(mountain papaya). They also raise animals for slaughter, including pigs, chickens, turkeys, and
guinea pigs. The jajañ is not only a source of food but also an extremely important cultural and
spiritual center for the Kamsá. As now Sibundoy has come to consist of a majority of colonos
(‘colonists’, the Spanish word used by Kamsás and Ingas to refer to white and mestizo
outsiders), many Kamsás have lost their land and thus no longer have their own jajañ.
The traditional diet of the Kamsá is centered around corn, with corn seen as a giver of
life. Some pan-Colombian corn-based dishes, such as arepas (corn cakes) and envueltos
(cornmeal boiled in banana leaves) are also common among the Kamsás, as well as soups with a
corn base. Wameshnen is a common soup, made with corn kernels (mote, in Spanish), as is
bis̈ans̈a, a soup that is garnished with collard greens. Corn is also used to make bocoy (chicha in
Spanish), a fermented, slightly alcoholic drink. Sometimes homemade fruit liquor is added to
make the drink stronger, particularly for festivals. When men work in the jajañ, they often drink
bocoy for its perceived energizing quality. Many Kamsás raise guinea pigs, using inedible leaves
and weeds from the garden as fodder for the guinea pigs, and in turn using their manure as
fertilizer for the garden. Guinea pig breeding is labor intensive, and the animals are only eaten
for special occasions or sold for a relatively high price in town. The Kamsáś make their own hot
sauce (ají in Spanish, the same name as the peppers used to make the sauce), using chili peppers,
onion, and vinegar. It is possible that people hunted traditionally, and there are stories about
people hunting, but I never heard of it happening while I was there.
In a Kamsá family’s home, it is customary always to offer a guest something to drink and
a small snack to eat. Chicha is the most traditional drink to offer, but it is labor intensive, taking
The gloss ‘garden’ is just an approximate translation and it is also sometimes rendered as ‘field, plantation’, and
even ‘estate, hacienda’. It is a combination of orchard, ranch, and vegetable garden.

instead, often families will offer a a black, very sweet coffee, instead (tinto in Colombian
Spanish). The snack is often an envuelto or arepa, but can also be bread, sometimes with unaged
cheese. It is very rude to refuse food or drink. There is a saying: Jtsabonÿnán ndoñ ts̈abian,
shëntsam kwanjanoban (‘It is not good to refuse food, you can/will die of hunger’).
Kamsá handicrafts are very important culturally. Perhaps the most common is the
ts̈ombiach, an intricately woven, multicolored band, as seen in Figure 1.2 ts̈ombiach (on the
following page). The patterns have special meanings. The ts̈ombiach are used for many purposes,
including as belts, as straps for bags, and as decorative ornaments to hang from the crown used
for Bets̈knaté, the annual Kamsá carnival. They are woven on a loom and typically take more
than a day to make. Masks are another traditional handicraft. They are carved out of wood and
are often painted or beaded. They are worn during certain ceremonies, particularly during
Bets̈knaté. Finally there are flutes which are important for dancing, during Bets̈knaté especially,
but traditionally there were other ceremonies that included dancing, as well, such as weddings.","[19, 20, 21]"

Kamsá has adverbs of manner, which can be defined as adverbs that tell how somethingis done. They have the same form as adjectives, but when they are functioning as adverbs they
are not inflected, and they almost always precede the verb. In other words, when they are
functioning as adverbs, they are not inflected (i.e. do not agree with anything) but when they are
functioning as adjectives, they can agree with the noun in case, class, number, and/or evaluative.
It is not clear if all adjectives can be used adverbially; more research is needed. Figure 7.2
summarizes the adverbs of manner in Kamsá.
Kamsá wordMeaningbetsko‘fast’wenán‘slow’ts̈abá‘well’ or ‘good’podesk‘bad, ugly’wabowan‘horrible’
Figure 7.2 Adverbs of mannerThe following sentences show adverbs of manner in clauses. In (3a) and (3b) betsko ‘fast’ is
shown; in both examples it precedes the verb. In (3c) and (3d) wenán ‘slow’ is shown; in both
examples it is used twice. In (3c) wenán precedes the verb and in (3d) wenán follows the verb. In
(3e) and (3f) ts̈abá ‘good, well’ is shown, in (3e) meaning ‘to sing well’ and in (3f) that an action
165went well. In (3g) podesk ‘ugly, ugily’ is used with the verb jojwan ‘reply’ to mean that the
woman replied nastily. Finally, in (3h) and (3i) another adverb is shown: natjëmban ‘calmly,
peacefully’. In (3h) it comes directly before the verb, and in (3i) it precedes shufta ‘uchuva fruit’
the object of the verb, which precedes the verb j-as-an ‘to eat’. The adverbs precede the VP in
most examples; in (3d), however, wenán wenán ‘slowly’ follows the verb phrase bo-j-onts̈á. jwastán ‘they (two) started to follow’ and in (3e) ts̈abá ‘good, well’ comes between ki-w-at-oben
‘she is not able to’ and j-abersian ‘sing’.

case, class, etc), but when used as an adjective, it must have a class marker if its referent has a
class marker, and it can have an evaluative to agree with its referent. Adjectives can also have
case markers if they are at the end of the NP.

Kamsá has several adverbs of degree, which can modify adjectives, other adverbs, and/orverbs. They cannot be inflected or agree with nouns. Adverbs of degree usually directly precede
the word they are modifying. The following table shows the adverbs of degree. Most can be
translated as ‘very’ or ‘very much’. Yap, from Inga yapa ‘a lot’, can modify adjectives, verbs,
and possibly other adverbs. Mallajt can modify adjectives and nouns, and could possibly be
analyzed as a quantifier, as discussed further below. Bien from Spanish bien ‘well’ can modify
adjectives and adverbs. Unlike the use of bien in Spanish, which usually goes with verbs, bien in
Kamsá mainly modifies adjectives and verbs, but it can sometimes modify verbs, as well. People
in southern Colombia often use bien in this way, like something is ‘bien difícil’ or ‘bien bonita’.
In my corpus korent and j-abwach only modify verbs, but it is possible that they could modify
other word classes, as well.

The following examples show adverbs of degree: yap, mallajt, bien, all of which mean
‘very’ and are modifying adjectives. In (5a-c), yap modifies adjectives flakwa ‘thin’ benoka
‘close’ and wabowan, ‘horrible’. (Note: In (5c), the status of wabowan isn’t clear, because
wabowan ‘horrible’ is being used substantively, as the subject of the sentence.). In (5d) mallajt
modifies bëts ‘big’ and in (5e) bien modifies tsbananok ‘tall’.

It is important to note that bien in Kamsá is more limited than bien in Spanish. InSpanish, bien usually means well, like ella canta bien ‘she sings well.’ In Kamsá, however, bien
means ‘very’ and modifies adjectives or adverbs. Generally, you cannot say that someone sings
bien; you have to say someone sings bien ts̈aba ‘very good’. There are exceptions, however, and
sometimes bien modifies a verb as in (7) where bien modifies j-owen ‘hear, understand’.

(Chindoy 77:6)7.2.4Issues for adverbs of degree
The class of adverbs of degree is complicated for several reasons. First, the distribution isvaried: yap and mallajkt can modify both adjectives and verbs, whereas jabwach and korent
seem only to go with verbs. Bien mostly goes with adjectives, despite its primary use in Spanish
to mean ‘well’, with verbs. yap and mallajkt, which seem to be able to modify the most words
classes, can also go with nouns or nominalized verbs. In (8a) yap is modifying a nominalized
verb, meaning ‘the ones not having drunk a lot’. In (8b) mallajkt is modifying a noun, twamb
170‘hen’, to mean ‘many hens’. Section 7.6 about quantifiers discusses the possibility of mallajkt
being a quantifier.

Deictics of place morphologically are like nouns (or adjectives?). They take limited casemarkers. They can take one of two locative markers: -ok or -ents̈e; the allative marker -oy; and
the ablative marker -an. Not all deictics of place take all markers, however. Many deictics of
place can also have the intensifier prefix ka-. Many deictics can have the topic marker =na,
without a change in meaning (as far as I can tell). It’s possible that more forms exist than the
ones I provide below.
There are two forms for ‘here’: mwents̈ and moka, but it is not clear what the difference
in meaning is. It is possible one is ‘here’ (static, no movement) and the other is locative ‘towards
here’ but more research is needed. There are also two forms for ‘there’: chents̈e and choka, with
choka meaning ‘there, farther away’. When the deictics have the ablative marker, it means
motion from, and when there is a allative marker, it means motion toward. There doesn’t seem to
be a allative form of either mwents̈ or moka, however; just the usual form is used.
Figure 7.4 (on the following page) details locative adverbs in Kamsá.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"
