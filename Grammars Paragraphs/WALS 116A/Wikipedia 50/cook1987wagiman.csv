10.3InterrogationInterrogation is of two functional types: polar interrogation, involving questions which can be answered with yaway
'yes' or wi3ya 'no', and non-polar interrogation, where
yaray or ri'ya are inaproppriate responses. Non-polar
interrogation involves so-called 'WH' questions, in which an
interrogative element of some type is required in the question, and which defines what is being questioned.
Polar interrogative sentences are syntactically identical
with declarative sentences, but differ in their intonation
contour; generally, major constituent order is unaffected.
Polar question intonation is not well understood, with few
examples occurring in the tape-recorded corpus.
Auditory
impressions of non-recorded examples indicate that suchquestions have a generally rising intonation over the final
syllables, in opposition to declaratives which have a generally falling final intonation contour. Alternations in word
order due to pragmatic factors can alter this dramatically,
with rising intonation occurring over single clause-initial
items if only they are being queried. However, this is not
an area that has been well recorded, and no concrete examples can be discussed here.","[300, 301]"
"4.5InterjectionsInterjections are a closed class which constitute whole
utterances on their own. They differ from adverbs in their
syntactic independence of other parts of speech. Recorded
interjections are yaray 'yes', ilkawu 'yes indeed, alright',
wi'ya 'no' and mamak 'goodbye'. There is also a tag question form gale, which can also be used as an interjection
reqcest for confirmation of a fact or other information.","[111, 112]"

10,2InterjectionsInterjections are few in number and include mamak 'goodbye',
and yaray 'yes1 and ri'ya 'no' which are used in response to
polar questions.
The short forms yu and yo are used for'yes' in response to requests for attention or when being
addressed. ri'ya also occurs with the nominal gala 'very'
to reinforce the negation, or to mean, 'I don't know', for
example :

10.3.1dyamba 'when'The relationship between dyamba 'when' and the same form
with an Irreakis negative meaning described in 10.1.1 above
is unclear; there is no evidence suggesting either homonymy
or an original polysemy. As an interrogative form, dyamba
questions the time of a predicate activity which has not yet
taken place, and thus carries irrealis meaning.",[301]
"[LMD 2;2]'No! My woman has gone a long way away. I

wi'ya has also been recorded in a small number of examples
with the form ga to mean 'do not want (to do)'.

recorded examples provide no clue of the status of ga aseither a suffix or a word, nor any evidence of its possible
wider meaning. It is not glossed in the following example:

The tag form gale occurs commonly in final position in
questions, and, uttered with a rising intonation contour,
has the effect of requesting confirmation of the fact of the
question by the addressee. Few examples occurred in recording sessions because speakers tended not to ask questions
themselves. A typical example occurred in the question
(often addressed to me by speakers at Rybrook Farm) 'The
others have gone to get food, haven't they?', the point of
which was to ask politely whether they could get a ride into
town or not. A reply 'no' or 'not yet' would then be followed by a request for a lift as well:10-41ba-ya-ggi
3pl:PFV-go-PASTdagany-gu,

TAG'They have all gone to get food, haven't they?'
gale is also able to occur alone in response to statements
by other speakers. In this way, it has the sense of, ' Is
that so?', or, 'Really?'.","[299, 300]"
"In such examples, the distinction between the question and
Irrealis negative interpretation of the sentence is through
its intonation contour.",[301]
"Chapter 10Adverbs, interjections and interrogationAdverbs and interjections form closed classes which contain
a small number of members only. Adverbs have mood, spatial
position and temporal marking functions, and can modify noun
phrases, verbs or whole clauses. Some of the 16 recorded
adverbs have more than one meaning, or two or more closely
connected meanings. For example, dyumbany can have the
spatial meaning 'behind' or the temporal meaning 'afterwards, last', while gorro can mean either 'tried but failed'
or 'later'.
The class of interjections includes the words wi'ya 'no' and
yaray 'yes'. There is also a word gale which generally
occurs in clause-final position as a tag question, but can
also occur alone to mean 'Is that true?' or 'Really?'. Its
word class membership is thus somewhat difficult to define,
but is described with interjections in 10.2 below.
Polar interrogati,on is signalled by a marked intonation
pattern over the sen.tence as a whole. So-called 'WH' questions variously involve the use of interrogative nominals,
adverbs or a participle, depending on what is being questioned in the clause. The interrogative nominals can also
have case-marking, again depending on sentential requirements.
10.1AdverbsAdverbs form a small closed class whose members have a relatively limited range of meanings. Their semantic functions
include the expression of sentential mood values, such as
negation, doubt and non-completion of the activity described
by the verb or predicate. Also included is a group of nondeictic locating expressions which indicate the spatial
position of one NP relative t r ~another, such as 'on top' ,
'behind' and so on.
In a notional definition of adverbs
these words would be excluded from membership in the classbecause they do not modify a verb or a sentence. Scme meanings expressed by Wagiman adverbs would be included in three
distinct word classes in some other Australian languages,
described as 'adverbals', 'locational qualifiers' and 'part'Locational qualifiers' desicles' (Dixon 1980:281-84).
cribed by Dixon can often be inflected, however, although
'particles' are usually uniuflecting (ibid.).
The class
designated by Dixon as 'adverbals' have the same morphological possibdlites as verbs, and thus do not corespond to
Wagiman 'adverbs'. It should be recalled that the primary
criteria for the definition of word classes given in Chapter
4 were grammatical:
distribution, range of possible syntactic functions and specifiable morphological categories.
Despite their apparently disparate meanings, Wagiman
'adverbs' are classified together because of their similar
grammatical characteristics; the term 'adverb' is chosen
because a major notional function of the class is, in fact,
the modification of verbs and clauses.
101.1dyamba 'cannot, rill not, do not'dyarba has three distinct meanings depending on grammatical
context: (i) it is used to express the subject or agent's
inability to carry out the activity expressed by the verb;
(ii) it marks a lack of desire to carry out this activity;
and (iii) in finite verb imperatives it marks a negative
command not to carry out the activity (cf. 7.2.3).
Generally, context provides information to distinguish between
the 'lack of desire1 and 'inability' meanings; often, however, the distinction is not clear or contextually required,
and 'cannot' and 'will not' are indistinguishable. The
unifying feature of these three meanings is that they all
deny, apart from negating, the possibility expressed by the
predicate of the clause. dyamba is thus used only for
irrealis situations, and is thus glossed as 'Irrealis negative' (IRR NEG):-10-1ga-qa-bu

If -4ana did not occur
in some expressions, it would be potentially difficult to
interpret the intended pronominal referent from the prefix
only, because both lpl and 2sg have the forms i
gi- and
mi-, and so on. This potential difficulty would seem to be
particularly increased in questions because the the hearer,
for general pragmatic reasons, is less certain about what
particular information (in this case, which pronominal referent) is being requested by the speaker. Declarative utterances would presumably be more open to contextual interpretation and suffer from less ambiguity. However, most lpl
intransitive questions are suffixed with -qana, as in example 6-118 below, while finite verbs that commence with gi-,
gi- and mi- and which are not marked with it are interpreted
as being 2sg. This varies according to obvious contextual
situations, but the following examples are typical:'Are we going now?'","[181, 182]"

I must extend my appreciation to Dr Peter Austin of La Trobe
University, who suggested Wagiman as a language worthy of
study. As my supervisor, he provided support in practical
matters such as acquiring funding for the fieldwork, as well
as reading and commenting on all stages of the work. His
questions, ideas and criticisms were stimulating and provoking, and prompted many lines of investigation. Early drafts
and sections of the description were also read by John
Henderson of the Institute for Aboriginal Development and
Gavan Breen of the School of Australian Linguistics, who
made many constructive suggestions which I happily acknowledge here; any errors, of course, remain mine alone.

It is difficult to determine the exact difference in value
and function between participle-only imperatives and finite
verb+participle imperatives. One possible distinction that
could underlie the choice of either is the explicit reference to the addressee in the finite verb pronominal prefix.
On the other hand, the second person and deictic reference
of the participle imperatives are defined in the same way as
that of the finite verb constructions: a referent (the
addressee) is given only by context in all second person
utterances (that is, by direct address if no name is used).
The overt marking for the second person addressee in finite
imperative clauses is thus no more explicit than that indicated solely by context in participle imperatives. A number
distinction remains as the only characterist-ic of finite
imperatives which participle imperatives do not have, andwhich would seem to be of even less importance than the
presence or absence of pronominal marking.
One difference that can be distinguished is illocutionary,
and participle-only participles seem to have more imperative
force than finite verb+participle forms.
Participle-only
imperatives have the effective discourse status of interjections, and carry a relatively high amount of illocutionary force. Their brevity (never more than four syllables,
even for the negative forms and carrying only one tonic
stress) also permits them to be uttered with a great deal of
articulary force in any conversational exchange or speech
situation. In 9-36 and 9-39 where a participle-only imperative occurs in the same utterance as a finite verb+participle imperative, the former construction occurs as the last
item in the sentence. In this position it has the illocutionary effect of reinforcing the command expressed in the
finite clause, providing strong force for the utterance as a
whole. 4
9.4Participles and aspect markingApart from Punctual marking in participle-only imperative
utterances, participles can be marked for Punctual or Sequential aspect in non-imperative finite clauses, and for
Punctual aspect in imperative finite clauses. In all cases,
the aspect marked on the participle functions as aspect
marking for the clause as a whole. It is thus possible for
participles to be marked for aspect while the finite verb in
the clause is marked only for tense or mood; the converse
situation also occurs.
Aspect marking on participles isIn 9-36 particularly, the use of buy' 'do completely' has
an effect similar to the tag 'Okay?' following some English
imperatives, such as, for example, 'Just do it, okay?'. The
direct illocution here is of a question, although it has the
indirect illocution of reinforcing the command rather than
genuinely rsqcesting a response; any response at all ought
only to take the form of an agreement.","[275, 276]"

"As an areal typological feature, it is thus not unusual for\Vagiman to carry some sort of temporal or aspectual marking
in affixes before finite verbs.
The use of an invariable
Desiderative prefix is typical, for example, of the function
of morphological prefixes in many languages in the Arnhem
Land and non-Pama-Nyungan area. l1 None of these languages,
however, except for Maung (geographically far from where
Wagiman was o~iginallyspoken), marked tense, aspect or mood
on a regular, systematic basis. In the Daly River languages
Ngankikurungkurr and Marrithiyel, evec though tense, aspect
and mood is marked by suppletive pronominal prefix forms,
they do not all represent the same tense, aspect or mood
oppositions, and are also far from regular across all the
finite (auxil)iary)
verbs.
The real question of how the
various forms developed in Wagiman must remain unanswered
through the lack of identifiably similar systems in the
area, by which reconstruction of the historical processes
could be made; the mood and aspect variation must therefore
be considered as an independent innovation,l1 This includes languages such as Nunggubuyu (Heath 1985),
Mara (Heath 1981), Warndarang (Heath 1980c), Ngalakan (Merlan 1983), Mangarayi (Merlan 1982), Kunwinjku (Carroll 1976)
and Rembarnga (McKay 1975). Many others are similar.",[233]
"attempts to elicit further examples later were not successful, for what appeared to be contextual reasons. At some
stage the addition of -yaman might have been a productive
process for the creation of participles from some other word
class, or for the creation of causative forms from other
participles, but this is not attested. It should be recalled that ya'an as a finite verb means ' to tell' or ' to do' ,
with a causative implication. gukaya'an 'camp out' can be
thus considered a derived causative form of guka 'sleep', in
which the addition of -ya8an expresses the causativity.
The translations provided by speakers for the rare occurrences of other -ya'an alternants (one each for yu'naya'an
and gurr'maya'an) did not indicate any apparent causative
meaning for them, although such an interpretation did not
seem impossible in their context. Both words were recorded
in unelicited speech. The root forms of each function occur
commonly without -yaman as class (ii) and (i) participles
respectively, supporting the hypothesis that its addition
may, at least in the past, have been a more productive process. This question is discussed more fully in 11.5.2
below.
In summary, all participles are two or more syllables in
length and finish with the vowel /a/. Reduplication is
possible, both of the unmarked participle as a whole or the
root form only, with aspectual or other slight meaning
changes.
As illustrated in Figure 9-1, Punctual participle forms are
derived from the unmarked form by reduction of the final
syllable in some way. In class (ii) and (iiia), the final
vowel is elided; for class (i) and (iiib), the entire final
-ma syllable is elided; no Punctual forms were recorded for
Case marking and the Sequential
class (iv) participles.
aspect suffix occur attached to the unmarked, citation form
directly. Aspect and case marking are discussed in 9.4 and
9.5 below.","[255, 256]"
"Furthermore, the participle and finite verb combine to form
semantically productive, complex lexical meanings, and
neither finite verbs nor participles can be said consistently to carry more of the semantic load than the other; the
finite verb is more than just a 'prop1 for inflection (an
auxiliary) as in Mangarayi (Merlan 1982:52).
In simple
finite clauses, in which a finite verb occurs without a
participle, any 'aux' function to be defined at all is carried, not by the verb root, but the prefix: it is marked
for tense and mood and occurs in first position, satisfying
two out of the three characteristics of ' A U X ' defined by
Steele et al. (1981:155-6). The third characteristic, that
aux occurs as a constituent, is more problematic on a level
of theoretical syntax not under discussion here.
In finite
participle clauses, the logical candidate for any auxiliary
remains the same. In all cases, finite verbs are lexically
full items, and remain so in participle clauses. Some other
approach is required.
Recently, Blake (ms.:120) has suggested that languages like
Wagiman are possibly amenable to a bi- or multi-clausal
analysis, where the 'auxiliary' (the finite verb) is described as the main clause verb and the 'particle1 (the participle) as the verb of a dependent clause. Nevertheless,
Blake rejects a bi-clausal analysis for Maranungku (a Daly
River language) for various reasons, and it is also rejected
here for Wagiman.
Several reasons, some similar to those
proposed by Blake, contribute to this:
In ambient constructions, the participle has
no arguments at all, and it is difficult to know how to
provide a bi-clausal paraphrase for an example such as 11-43
(1)Whether the prefix is an inflectional category or a syntactic constituent is a theoretically abstract question, and
will not be addressed in what is primarily a descriptive
grammar. Certainly, it is a morphologically obligatory
constituent of the finite verb complex.","[333, 334]"
"would become neutralized with the 3sg Imperfective form gaif the systematic alternation of g- with g- for Perfective
and Imperfective were applied to it. The functional problems created by this particular potential neutralization
might have been too great to be resolved by pragmatic or
other contextual factors, and might have blocked the use of
g- for lsg. It could be imagined that the identity of 3sg
and lsg prefixes would place the system under strain, even
with the availability of optional free pronouns. Very few
functional problems arise from the aspect neutralization,
however, and apparently none that are quite as critical as
the potential first and third person singular neutralization. Pragmatic factors, optionally available tense suffixes
and the less critical information expressed by the aspectual
difference itself seem to combine to prevent them from arising.
However, it is likely that the neutralization of lpl and 2sg
forms generally would also cause problems, particularly for
the lpl/2sg and 2pl/lsg functions (giqgu-, giqgu-, miggu-)
in questions such as, for example, 'Who is going to get
meat? Are you (pl) getting meat for us, or are we getting
Unfortunately, the lack of recorded
meat for you (sg)?'
conversational material in the language makes the normal
method of resolution of such potential problems difficult to
state. In the few recorded examples of giqgu- (it is a
relatively rare form insone-to-one language sessions because
in all its references, one actant is lpl), it occurred with
an overt Ergative case marked agent, or an unmarked (Absolutive) pronominal patient. The lpl inclusive suffix q a n a
can also be used in intransitive clauses to indicate explicitly that the agent referent is lpl, but is structurally
ambiguous in transitive clauses when it occurs without overt

"Despite the productivity of the system generally, it is not
predictable for some cases, such as yorrtja + ge-na to mean
'to find' where ge-na usually means 'to put1, or for getja +
ge-na meaning 'to ask1. The latter example is understandable if getja is taken as meaning something like 'question',
but it is not a predictable combination: a finite verb such
as ya'an 'to say' would seem a priori to be just as likely,
but, in fact, does not occur.
11.6Oblique contrastive constructionsOblique contrastive constructions are not well represented
in the corpus numerically, and speakers did not respond well
to attempts to elicit them. However, the recorded occurrences are recognized by the presence of an Oblique (and
occasionally Possessive) pronoun, often marked with the
Specific referent suffix, as the complement of a copula
verb. A small number are functionally c~mparativeclauses,
while others merely contrast two propositions, one of which
can be seen as the converse of the other. The Specific
referent suffix also occurs in non-Oblique contrastive sentences, to mark the item being contrasted (see 6.3.4).
Most
of the following examples were unelicited.
The recorded comparative constructions comprise either one
or two clauses. Some examples provided by Lulu Martin Dalpalngali utilise yu-gin 'to be' and ya-qgi 'to go' as copula verbs, with an Oblique pronoun marking the object of
comparison (the 'standard'); George Allen Mundeng provided
one example (a translation elicitation) as a verbless equational clause.
Lulu Martin, on one occasion, gave two consecutive examples
which differ slightly. In one, the comparative nominal
occurs as the subject of the clause, with an Oblique pronominal complement expressing the object of comparison. A
second 'comparative' clause containing an antonym of the
quality being compared also follows the first to express
unambiguously exactly which referent has which quality. An
8interesting point in this clause is that the object of comparison is stated again as an Oblique pronoun complement of
the verb in either a type of 'impersonal' or 'Oblique subject' construction: because of ordering flexibility in
general, and the lack of nominal subject marking in particular, it is not possible to tell which NP is subject of the
verb yu- in the second clause of 11-56.

complement of a finite clause containing a verb of motion,

before the participle that often occurs with Ablative or
Dative marked participles, and are effectively identical in
form and intonation to a typical nominal Allative complement
of a verb of motion. The lack of a logical link between the
verb and the participle reinforces the possibility that
Intentional participle examples are not the same type of
adclausal complement constructions as the Purposive and
Causative types, but are merely Allative nominal complements
of a verb of motion.","[281, 282]"
"Because only about half the lexical items with initial dorsal and laminal stops are completely predictable in their
voicing quality, a possible contrast might be proposed wordinitially for these points of articulation. However, all
words that commence with a voiceless stop can, without any
change in meaning or speaker recognition, be realized with
the equivalent voiced stop. Rather than a situation of
contrast, this implies free variation among a limited number
of words and stops. Nevertheless, the notion of free vari-,Ii36
ation would seem to be inappropriate. An important fact is
that only approximately half the recorded words containing
initial dorsal and lamina1 stops have unpredictable voicing.
There is, moreover, not really any variation in the true
sense of 'free variation' (noting that free variation is not
necessarily 'free', where discourse or social factors can
underly variation), because speakers rarely 'vary' from one
realization to the other, but usually use the same realization in nearly every utterance. Variation occurs across
indivi-dual speakers, rather than within a speaker's idiolect.
It is only when initial stop voicing is tested in
citation sessions, or recorded occasionally in unelicited
speech, that variation tends to occur.
Instead of a situation of free variation, this behaviour
suggests a possible linguistic change in progress, from one
realization of word-initial stops to another. Although a
sound change is likely to be phonetically abrupt, it will be
diffused through a speaker's vocabulary only gradually (Wang
1969:14-15).
It is possible that such a process is occurring in Wagiman, in which only a part of the vocabulary of
speakers has so far been affected. However, the question of
directionality and rate arises: whether the change is towards a voiceless realization for all initial stops, in
which case it has only just begun, or whether it is towards
a voiced realization, and is therefore nearly complete.
Although directionality is difficult to determine, areal
evidence tends to suggest that initial voiced stops are
typical, and that any change which is occurring is in that
direction.
In most languages with in the area, the contrast is neutralized with voiced stops word-initially. 8
Methods for the determination of the directionality and
rate of linguistic change in progress are described in Bailey (1973), but are based on large numbers of speakers,
clearly categorized into socially and otherwise distinct
groups. This approach is not possible for Wagiman.
In some Yolngu languages, however, it is possible for
stops to be voiceless initially, although there is variation37It would seem likely that, if Wagiman has developed a stop
contrast along lines similar to those of other languages, or
if it has assimilated one as an areal feature, it would also
tend similarly to move towards voiced realizations.
Evidence for original. voiceless initial stops from within
the language is sparse, although the voiced initial stop in
biyakin 'sister' ([biyakin]) is voiceless following prefixation with the Female kin reference prefix gal- (cf. 6.3.6):
qal-piyakin ([qalpiyakin]).
The alternation from voiced to
voiceless would seem to be unmotivated phonetically: both
voiced and voiceless stops can occur phonemically following
1
and the phonetic eovironment in gal-piyakin following
the stop (apart from stress), remains unchanged. A possible
conclusion is that the original stop was voiceless but is
now only reflected in the pronunciation following the prefix, while the voiced realization has developed with other
word-initial voiced stops.
An apparently contradictory example is found in the participle form guka 'sleep' ([kuka]), which has an initial
voiceless stop.
Following prefixation as a finite verb,
however, the stop is voiced, so that 4s-guka-n 'I am sleeping' ( lsg-sleep-PRES) is phonetically [gagukanj. Several
points can be noted here. The first is tbat the voiced
realization could be due to assimilation of the stop to the
voicing of the surrounding vowels, although the following
intervocalic voiceless stop would then remain unexplained.
As a general rule, however, initial stops in finite verb
roots and suffixes are voiced, so [g] in [gagukan] might be
the result of an analogous levelling process. The initial
[k] in the participle guha can also be pronounced as [g],
although it is rare. One possible conclusion that can be
drawn is that [kuka] reflects an original, as yet unchanged,which might be due to conditioning factors; there is so far
no evidence of consistent association with any phonetic
feature later'in the word (B. Schebeck pers. comm.).","[53, 54, 55]"

'syntax' in Wagiman. Topics discussed are of language-specific as well as typological interest: NP structure, major
constituent order, non-finite equational clauses, finite
clause adjunction, the syntax. of participle constructions,
Oblique contrastive constructions, reduplication and a syntactic focus clitic.
11.1Noun Phrase structureThe constituent 'Noun Phrase' (NP) can be justified on the
basis that case marking suffixes normally occur on the final
element only of contiguous nominal members of an NP. Discontinuous NPs, where members are separated from each other
by some other lexical category, do not occur. Nominals
separated by other items in a clause are thus always members
of different NPs, although not all examples of contiguous
nominals need necessarily be members of the same NP. However, morphologically unmarked nominals having different NP
membership are rare (see 11.2 below), and are in any case
distinguished through context and intonation.
The following sections describe NP constituent order and
case marking respectively.
11.1.1NP constituent orderAn NP typically consists of two, and occasionally three,
nominals, one of which (the 'head') is semantically modified
by the other(s)
The relative order of the head and modifiers of NPs is not grammatically fixed, although some generalizations are possible.
Following Greenberg's (1963)
approach to the typology of language on the basis of the
order of sentence elements, modifiers of an NP head nominal
( N ) are categorized here into various classes: demonstratives (IDEM'), including all the deictics; adjectival.","[302, 303, 304, 305]"

5.4.1.4dyaman [Anaphoric]:thatThe use of dya'an as an anaphoric demonstrative is perhaps
less well recorded than the deictic demonstratives. Itoccurs most commonly in textual and other unelicited material, and only rarely in elicited examples. The common contexts for its use are situations of unstructured conversation, and in utterances which have enough preceding context
to permit discourse anaphora.
The more formal linguistic
contexts in which speakers often provided data reduced its
occurrence.
dya'an is more commonly used as an interrogative or indefinite nominal meaning 'what' or 'which' (see 10.3.2).
Its
demonstrative and interrogative uses seem to be linked semantically in the same way that 'what' can be used both as an
interrogative particle and a relative pronoun in English.
In Wagiman the anaphoric use of dya1an to modify a nominal
in an NP signals that the speaker is referring to an item
assumed to be known by the hearer, for example, 'the man
that (I referred to before)'. Once an item has been specified using one of the three deictic demonstratives, it is
then possible to refer to it later in a discourse with the
anaphoric demonstrative. In a text or discourse placed in
the past, the usual first reference to a participant is with
ga'an, and subsequent reference can be with-dya'an.
When
dya'an is used without any preceding context, it marks its
referent as being one which the speaker presumes the hearer
already understands as having a given reference.
dyalan has no distance features associated with it, and is
glossed as 'anaphora' (ANAPH).
The following examples are given with context. Example 5-44
has no recorded linguistic context, but an outline of the
circumstances of its utterance is given.
Although brief, 5-44 is typical. It was recorded as a response to a question concerning who was not going to a particular meeting in town because of a lack of space in the
car, and the old man referred to was already sitting waiting
nearby.

There is very little preceding discourse context for 5-45.
It seems to have been prompted by the preceding utterance
(also given in the example, and also unelicited) which provided the reference to spears with some relevance. The type
of shovel spears referred to were standing in a corner of

"A further problem occurs with the terms 'fortis' and 'lenis'
themselves, and is described by Ladefoged (1971:24) who,
agreeing with Lisker and Abramson (1964), states that:
'nearly all these sounds [fortis/lenis] vary only
in the relations between the time at which voicing
commences and the time at which the stricture is
released; consequently these sounds can be specified adequately by means of such terms as voiced,
voiceless, aspirated, and unaspirated.'
There is in general terms, a distinct lack of specificity in
the definition of the use of the terms 'fortis' and 'lenis'
in the descriptions of stop contrasts which use them.
Heath, for example, never questions their phonetic value, or
that the terms 'voiced' and 'voiceless' (or even 'long' and
short') might be more appropriate, although he does state
in his description of Ngandi (Heath 1978a) that duration is
equally as distinctive in distinguishing between the two
types of stops as voicing. For Ritharngu, Heath (1980b:8)
also states that the principal difference is one of voicing
and 'tenseness'.
It can only be presumed that Heath and
others intend that by 'fortis' and 'lenis' they mean a 'variation in the degree of activity of the respiratory muscles'
(Ladefoged 1971:24). This is not always clear, however.
Where the stop contrast is not analysed in terms of voicing,
it is usually due to non-predictable variations in the voicing of stops in contrastive environments. This has lead to
the use of the terms 'fortis/ lenis' in an attempt to find
some other phonetic basis for the contrast. Later work by
Jaeger (1983) has shown that while two different stop contrast types can be defined ('voice onset time' (VOT) and
'fortis/lenis' types), the notion of 'fortis/lenisl as the
basis of the opposition is difficult to sustain. She argues
that use of the notion of 'force of articulation' for the
differences between the stops obscures other phonetic factors, such as duration, glottal width and possibly closure
width which actually produce the contrast; other parameters47such as oral air pressure and air flow are also given as
stemming from these primary factors (Jaeger 1983:187). The
terms 'fortis' c.nd 'lenis' are retained pending further
clarification of the factors that are involved, however, and
will be used here on the same basis.
'VOT languages' are so called because the basis for the consonant contrast can be defined generally in terms of voice
onset time: a distinctioc of, for example, voicing or aspiration usually occurs in every contrastive position, and
there is little fluctuation of voicing and closure type.
Conversely, although 'fortis/lenis languages' commonly have
variation in closure type (voicing), duration is reported to
be a consistent parameter for differentiation hetween the
A key factor in decidtwo types of stops (op. cit.:184-5).
ing on which type of contrast occurs in a given language is
variation or consistency of voicing in contrastive environments, and the presence or absence of auditorily salient
duration. 13
Voicing was described in section 1.3.1 above as a consistent
auditory cue for the distinction of stops in Wagiman, and
although relative length is occasionally audible, it is a
rare and inconsistent feature. Wagiman is thus a VOT language, for which the terms 'fortisllenis' are not relevant;
the lack of aspiration as a feature of stops also provides
support for the hypothesis that voicing is the phonetic
basis of the contrast generally.
Voiced and voiceless symbols are therefore used in the phonemic orthography. In neutralized environments the following
conventions apply:l3 Auditory saliency is an important factor: variation in
duration has also been shown to correlate with voiced and
voiceless consonants in some languages (such as French,
KiMvita Swahili, Danish) discussed by Jaeger as (presumably)
VOT, but it is not consistent and the differences are, moreover, inaudible (Jaeger 1983:185).
%In word-initial and morpheme-initial position,
(i)
voiced symbols are used.
(ii)
Folowing nasals stops are typically voiced,
and voiced symbols are again used;
(iii)
In word-final position and in stop+stop clusters stops are voiceless, and voiceless symbols are thus
used.
The orthography used here is not intended to be a practical
orthography for use by speakers (for example, the symbol q
is also used), but is designed to assist pronunciation of
examples by conforming relatively closely to the phonetics.
1.3.5Stop devoicing and cluster degeminationA consequence of a segmental approach is that the morpheme
boundary sandhi phenomena of stop devoicing and cluster
degemination need to be accounted for. When a stop cluster
occurs across a morpheme boundary, normally voiced morphemeinitial stops become voiceless, while all homorganic consonant clusters created in this way also become degeminate.
Homorganic stop clusters are realized as voiceless simple
stops, while homorganic clusters of other consonants are
merely realized as phonetically simple (ie. single) consonants.
Morpheme-initial stop devoicing can be considered as assimilation of a voiced stop to a preceding voiceless stop. For
example, gumit 'skin' ([gumit]) plus the Allative suffix -ga
([gal) produces the orthographic sequence gumit-ga, but one
which is phonetically [gumitka].
While devoicing occurs only for oral stops, degemination of
homorganic consonant clusters across morpheme boundaries
occurs for all consonants.
When a morpheme or word ends
with the same consonant as the following morpheme or word,
then degemination of the homorganic cluster produces a sim-ple, short consonant. For example, the collocation of godal
'head' ([kodal]) and liwa dyondon 'bad rubbish' ([liwa
tyondon]), in godal lira dyondon, a fixed expression meaning
'stupid1,produces the phonetic string [kodaliwatyondon]; a
simple [l] occurs at the word juncture where there is a
phonemic /1+1/ cluster. The simple degemination rule Ci+ci
jci can therefore be proposed.
Devoicing and degemination fall together when a homorganic
stop cluster is formed across a morpheme or word boundary.
For example, the word dyulak 'bird' ([dyulak]) plus Dative
case -gu ([gu]) in dyulak-gu produces the string [dyulaku],
Devoicing and degemination serve
where [k] is from [k+g]
to reduce the cluster to a single voiceless stop.","[63, 64, 65, 66, 67]"
"possible explanation is thus provided for why two-participle
imperatives do not occur: each participle is an entire and
complete utterance on its own.
Where they have a positive imperative function, punctual
aspect marking on participles highlights a verb-like status
similar to that which they h8,-ire
in finite clauses. However,
negative participle imperati-:.::s are expressed by attaching
the nominal Privative suffix -neten to the unmarked stem of
the participle, thereby highlighting a nominal-like status

'Don't laugh!'","[274, 275]"
"A rather complicated picture of historical changes emerges,
if it is assumed that there were no neutralizations in the
original system, although this is not necessarily justified.
Possible sources of the neutralized forms are summarized as
follows:
If the form giggu- were actually an original
lpl/ 2pl form, then it is possible to consider that it may
have been extended to lpl/2sg function (which it has now)
for reasons of politeness, or extension of reference. The
contrast between lp1/2pl and lpl/2sg may then have been
neutralized formally, and then been followed by the extension of the lp1/3pl form giba- to lp1/2pl.
lpl/2sg giggu- must have then been collapsed
in some way with the 2pl/lpl function. Either phonetic
changes took place, of which no evidence remains, or a reanalysis of the form's function occurred. A likely explanation is that the general neutralization of the lpl and 2sg
prefix contrast for intransitive forms led to a re-analysis
of the transitive form giqgu-. The use of gi- for both lpl
agents from 2sg in prefixes because both have initial qi-.
Thus, gi- in qiqgu- can possibly be considered as reflecting
either a lpl or 2sg referent. The form -qgu also generally
occurs in other forms where there is a plural patient. If-4gu in giggu- is analysed as reflecting a (1)pl patient,
then 41- in the same form can also be considered as representing a 2sg agent by default; the reverse could also have
occurred, and 01- could have been re-analysed as 2sg first.
giggu can therefore be analysed as gi+qgu, and seen as either lplA+(2)plO or 2sgA+(l)plO.
If this were actually the
case, and an originally transparent prefix system became
more opaque over time, then it is possible that speakers
could have re-analysed the form and extended its use in the
way described. One other motivation for formal and functional re-analysis could have been due to a loss of explicitness in the person/number hierarchy which controlled the
original order of pronominal reference in prefix forms;
there is currently no evidence to determine whether lpl is
higher than 2sg (see 7.4.2).
(iii)
The 2pl/lpl form could then have been extended
to cover 3sg/lpl reference. An analogous form is found in
3sg/2pl guqgu-, where the first syllable gu- refers to the
2pl Patient. A possibility is that the original system
already had a neutralization here, with an orignal 3sg/lpl
form qqgu-, although the re-analysis is, a priori, no more
unlikely than others described above.
The alternative solution is that originally there were distinct forms for all of the neutralized functions, but that
they were then all reduced to the same form giggu- by various phonological processes which also reduced other forms
in the matrix.
Different original base forms would have
been affected in different ways, severely enough to obscure
completely any of the underlying traces of individual pronominal forms. Such a solution provides no evidence of specific reductions or possible original forms, assuming as it
does that these are now totally lost, and is thus less open
to testing than the one given above.
The neutralization of the aspect distinction for all lsg
prefix forms (transitive, as well as intransitive) is perhaps due to the fact that the intransitive lsg form qa--.","[219, 220]"
"4.3ParticiplesParticiples form an open class which 4 s functionally quite
complex, having various features of nominals, adverbs and
verbs.
However, they are simply identified formally and
syntactically: they can be suffixed with the Dative, Ablative and Allative case suffixes to express adclausal complements; they can occur in a clause with a verb, marked for
Punctual or Sequential aspect and, when transitive, can have
an overt nominal object argument; they can be suffixed with
the nominal privative marker to express negative imperative
utterances; they can be suffixed with the nominal comitative
suffix to function as predicates of another nominal; and
they can occur alone, either unmarked or marked for punctual
aspect, as positive imperatives.
When they occur as case-marked adclausal elements, these
items clearly function as nominals, and can be substituted
for by them; when they occur as imperatives (even when suffixed with the nominal privative marker) they are clearly
functioning as predicates. This latter feature is more
apparent when they have their own nominal object argument.
Their 'adverbial' function is only notional, but some participles have positional and orientational meanings where they
describe the manner of the action ('upwards', 'downwards',
'inside, inwards, within', 'outside, outwards, without').
Many part-iciples also occur with copula verbs where they
appear to have predicative nominal meanings, such as 'sick',
'hot' and 'sated'.
The class of participles includes items whose meanings would
place them in other classes in some other languages. The
open participle class tends to compensate for the closed
verb and adverb classes by having members which express
functionally verb-like and adverb-like meanings. Many words
whose meanings could potentially be coded as predicative
nominals actually occur as participles. This situation j\-4\-0
makes identifying an appriate name for the class more diffi$'
cult than for others because of the wide range of notionaland semantic functions covered, and the range of syntactic
possibilities expressed. Although these items are not deverbal or otherwise derived forms, the name 'participle' is
used here because of the nominal and predicate functions
which these words have, in much the same way as the 'participle' forms of English and other European languages' verbs
can have both.predicate and argument features.4
4.4AdverbsAdverbs form an apparently closed class, the members of
which are unsuffixed and occur in clauses containing at
least a verb.
Sub-classes of mood, manner, position and
time can be identified. The mood adverbs are dyamba 'canndt , do not ' , r u d y i ' N E G A T I V E ' , menuny 'perhaps' , g o r r o
' tried but failed ' and manya ' can, must '
Many of the manner, time and position adverbs have meanings which allow
them to occur in more than one sub-classification, suggesting that only one other sub-class including them all can be
justified. However, approximate groups are: dyumbany
'last, afterwards, behind' and yoggona ' first , before, in
front' (both manner and position function), dyapan 'slowly',
g a h a 'fast' (manner function only); position adverbs wolok
'on top', wrnrya 'underneath', d a b a l i 'beside, around', dubay
'low down, downstream', gaqga 'high up, uphill'; and time
adverbs goko 'still, again' and ylmbama 'all the time' (as
well as gorro 'later').","[109, 110, 111]"

When one actant specified in the prefix is singular, as in
the above example, ambiguity of whether the Pair suffix
refers to Agent or Patient does not occur because it can
only refer to a non-singular referent, despite the fact that
it can occur on a singular nominal in the clause. . Examples
6-106 and 6-107 can only have the meaning given in their
translations for this reason:

6.4.2Plural suffixes -bnga, -godinThe two Plural suffixes are not exactly synonymous, but have
almost complementary functions: -godin is only used on
demonstratives in third person pronominal %unction, whereas
-bnga is used on all pronominals, full nominals and finite
verbs. When either is used, they indicate that their referent is more than one in number. Because the pronominal or
nominal referent of these suffixes can be two or more in
number, they include in their scope items that could be
marked by the Pair suffixes. They are thus strictly nonsingular, rather than plural, and reflect the singular/
plural number marking in most parts of the prefix system
(cf. 7.1).
can also occur on demonstratives, and it is not clear
why -godin is restricted in its use. Examples of these
suff4xes on nominals are as follows:

"An alternative possibility is that the prefixes represent
original vowel qualities, and that the fr.ee pronouns have
undergone any possible phonological change.
The original
vowels in the free pronouns could have been the high vowels
/u/ and i
Reduction of the final syllable of free pronouns when they were prefixed could have produced prefix
forms $41- from 2sg sgigun and *gi- from lpl *gigu. Ambiguity would not have arisen if these early prefixes were
used in strict cross-referencing function, because their
full nominals would still have been in the clause and available for referential access; ambiguity still seems not to
occur, despite the lack of current cross-referential function.
The development of mid vowels in the free forms could then
have taken place with the possible regular development of
these vowels in the language as a whole. Triggers for the
lowering of a high vowel to a mid vowel could have been in
the syllable following the high vowel, preventing the change
occurring for prefixes which were isolated from their usual
following syllable.
7.4.1NeutralizationsThe transitive forms show a variety of interesting features,
including several neutralizations, described in Figure 7-6.
All mood and aspect forms are given, although only the Perfective (and presumed older) forms are used in the following
discussion.
The neutralization of lp1/3pl with 2sg/3pl for qiba- can be
considered as resulting from the same phonetic process that
neutralized the intransitive lpl and 2sg distinction. More
interesting are the neutralizations of lp1/2pl with lp1/3pl
for qiba-, and lpl/2sg, 2pl/lpl and 3sg/lpl for qiggu-.",[217]
"Perfective aspect is generally used to refer to an activity
with no explicit reference to its internal temporal constituency, as if from outside the event (Comrie 1976:3,12).
Events referred to in such a way are easily interpreted as
being complete, whole events, and therefore in the past.
Imperfective aspect, on the other hand, is used to present
an event as if from within, with explicit reference to internal temporal constituency (Comrie loc. cit.).
Because the
event is presented from within, it can be considered in one
way as ongoing, and therefore in the present or non-past.
In Wagiman, the Perfective aspect always refers to past
time, while the Imperfective, unless explicitly marked for
past time by suffix, refers to non-past or present time. 2
Future time on non-tense-marked verbs is not always marked
by a Potential mood prefix, and immediate future time, or
events with a very high probability, are expressed with an
Indicative Imperfective prefix. The speaker's belief that
the action is more than only possible, and is effectively
factual, is thus reflected by mood choice:
7-9gaba-pa
ga~ut

7-10ganin qa-dipa
spear lsg-makegawor
afternoon[DLB 831'I am going to make a spear this afternoon. '
It is not possible to illustrate the aspectual contrast for
the Indicative prefixes without a Past tense suffix on the
verb. The following examples are instances of the alternation in meaning which occurs for Past imperfective and Past
perfective marked verbs:2
The west African languages Yoruba and Igbo, for example,
which have no grammatical tense marking, also use aspect
marking for time reference in the same way (Comrie 1976:82).",[192]
"Conditional (CONDIT) constructions include not only 'if
then' types, but also 'this so that' sentences. Both types
are functionally similar: the first clause contains a proposition which is potentially true, and the second clause
describes an event which is the logical or projected implication of the truth of the first clause. No examples were
recorded where the first clause was negative, however, and
speakers tended to re-phrase English prompt sentences so
that the first clause was always
- -~ositive,usually by using
a different verb; it did not seem apparent on these occasions that the negative examples were grammatically impossible, but rather that their contexts were not appropriate
at the time.
-...",[330]
"Another point involves the syntactic relationship of prefixes with the free nominals in a clause. It has recently
been proposed (Jelinek 1985) that constructions such as
those in the examples above indicate that the prefixes are
the underlying, primary nominal representation in a clause,
and that any free nominals which do occur add information
only to their specification and reference. This situation
can be observed in the wholeipart example above (7-I), where
the 'hand' adds information about what part of the patient
was bitten. The Pair inclusive examples are similar in that
the free nominal suffixed with - g i n indicates more precisely the reference of the lpl prefix. The speaker (lsg in a
lpl prefix) is already a given referent of the prefix, and
the addition of the information about the other person
specified its referent more precisely.
7.2Mood, t e n s e and aspect systemMood, tense and aspect affixes can be discussed in terms of
their function in the temporal deixis system as a whole.
The interaction of the various optional and obligatory affixes is based on a general principle of leftwards scoping
which operates to control affixes to the right, so that
their meaning is affected by the semantic range of the prefix and other affixes to the left. The direction of affix
scoping over finite verbs is in direct contrast to that
which usually operates over nominals (see 6.1).
Because of the scoping principle, the prefix, as normally
the left-most element, is the primary semantic element in
the verb complex and can be considered as functionally separate from the suffixes. Apart from its pronominal and
categorizational function, the prefix determines the mood
and aspect of a clause. Other suffixes that optionally
follow the verb root add information concerning tense or
aspect, but have reference to time or action only within the
semantic limits set by the left-most prefix. Most combinations of suffixes and prefixes function to create mood, tense
and aspect meanings that are relatively straightforward, but171others are more complex. Affix scope is described separately in 7.2.5.
The next sections deal with the meaning and
uses of the various mood, aspect and tense affixes.
Mood and aspect function of t h e prefixesThe three series of prefixes reflect two primary oppositions
of mood and aspect. The Imperfective and Perfective aspect
prefixes are essentially indicative in mood, and can be
contrasted with the Potential mood series. Within the Indicative mood, an aspect distinction is made between imperfective and perfective.
t
The Potential mood prefixes are used to reflect the speaker's belief that what he or she is saying is within the
realms of possibility only. In this sense they can be used
to refer to events, actions or states in the future, those
that might happen, or events or actions in general that
merely could occur. Potential mood prefixed verbs that are
negated reflect the speaker's belief that the possibility
does not exist. Indicative prefixes, on the other hand, are
used to indicate the speaker's belief in the essential reality of what is being said, and are used to describe events
that are considered to be real and more than just in the
realms of possibility.
Because it is based on speakers'
beliefs, mood choice is flexible in respect of so-called
'objective' reality.
When the prefixes occur on finite verbs that are not otherwise marked with tense or aspect suffixes, their primary
function is to indicate tense, rather than mood or aspect.
The Perfective prefixes have never been recorded without a
tense suffix of some kind on the verb as well, but are in
any case always associated with past time. The Potential
prefixes are used to indicate future time, and the Imperfective prefixes to mark non-past time.
The prefix forms
that represent lsg as either agent, patient or subject are
neutralized for the general Indicative mood aspectual contrast, and all commence
with ga-. These forms are unglossed
-+172
for mood or aspect, and effectively represent only Indicative mood.
Examples 7-5 to 7-8 illustrate the unmarked tense functions
of prefixes. The use of the Past punctual tense/aspect
suffix on the verb in 7-7 is typical of Perfective prefixed
verbs, but in 7-8 it provides an unambiguous past time reference for the action because the aspect contrast is neutralized in the lnon-sg., non-Potential prefix ga-:

ABSTRACTThis thesis is a grammatical description of the Wagiman
Aboriginal language spoken in the north-west of the Northern
Territory of Australia.
The Introduction provides a brief cultural and social description of the Wagiman people today, their recent history,
the framework of the description, the extent of previous
research, the position of Wagiman relative to neighbouring
languages and its classification as 'non-Pama-Nyungan.
Chapter 1 describes the phonological system, which includes
a contrast between two different types of stops, as well as
a glottal stop. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with stress, phonotactic constraints and the morpho-phonological variation to
be found.
A limited number of word classes can be defined on gramrnati-cal grounds, and these are dsscribed in Chapter 4 ; subclasses are also proposed on the basis of semantic features.
Chapter 5 illustrates the nominal deictic system, including
the functions of pronouns, demonstratives and other locational deictic forms, and examines the semantic basis of the
demonstrative contrasts.
Chapters 6 and 7 introduce nominal and finite verb affixing
morphology respectively, including case and non-case suffixes for nominals, and person/number/mood/aspect prefixes,
and tense and aspect suffixes for verbs.
The systematic
interaction of these latter affixes is analysed in terms of
a principle of 'leftwards scope'.
There are a restricted number of finite verbs, and these are
listed in Chapter 8; the use and features of a number of
'special' verbs is also exemplified. Chapter 9 focusses on

range of different types'of meaning,
Chapt'er 10 p2esents the various adverb types and interjections, as well as the morphological bases of non-polar
interrogation.","[15, 16, 17]"
"The neutralization of the contrast between lpl/2sg, 2sg/lpl
and 2pl/lpl in the form qiggn- presents a more difficult
problem, and there is no definite resolution available from
the current data. The initial problem lies in proposing an
original function for the form qiggu- itself. On analogical
grounds, either lp1/2pl (as discussed above) or 3sg/lpl are
possible. The latter possibility is based on the fact that
3sg/2pl is comprised of the 2pl root gu- followed by -ggu;
qiqgu- could thus be lpl gi- followed by -ggu. An assumption would also be that lpl/2sg qiqgu- is also not an original form, which does not seem unlikely given that other forms
with a 2sg patient end either with -ndyu or -ny.","[218, 219]"
"I am going to take you (asCOMP constructions differ primarily from direct speech examples in their intonation, and whilst the reported speech is
often separated from the rest of the utterance by an intonation break, it is not then uttered with its original intonation. Instead, it resumes with the same intonation as the
preceding phrase, so that both are effectively presented as
finite clauses in apposition, similar to ordinary conjoined
clauses.
Examples provided with COMP translations still
maintain the original mood and tense marking, but do not
have ya'an repeated at the end. They typically contain a
reference to the hearer or addressee of the speech act
through the presence of an overt Oblique object pronoun.
Example 11-32 below has quite complicated material following
the clause which introduces the reported speech, and alsohas no intonation break preceding it; it was uttered with a
single intonation contour as a unit phrase and is thus relatively long:

which they can begin and end, and the various sequences of
consonants and vowels which can occur within them. The
restrictions on consonant sequences have been described
above, and words are composed of sequences of syllables
whose initial and final elements are thus constrained. This
has been noted by Dixon (1980:159) for many Australian languages, in which word structure cannot be described only in
terms of the repetition of the 'canonical' syllable structure ClV(C2).
\A phonological word in Wagiman must contain a minimum of one
closed (CVC) syllable. Di-syllabic words fall into two

always based on the repetition of V, VC, CV or CVC syllables, within the restrictions on various consonant clusters
mentioned above. A word may not begin with a consonant
cluster (except for #gy- in the one word gyuka 'spit'),
parallel with the restriction on syllable-initial clusters
(a syllable can commence with no more than one consonant),
or end with a consonant cluster (except for -lk# in the word
ladyadilk 'wet season').

/rr/ were recorded, and it is probable that it is not permitted word-finally, in contrast with other Australian languages which permit final /rr/ but not /r/ (Dixon 1980:
165-6).
Permitted initial and final consonants are summarized in Figure 2-2.

"\Iany general syllable or cluster types. lo The geminate approach would thus require 'underlying' syllable types (C)VCC
and (C)VC which would contrast with surface types by the
application of degemination and devoicing. The distinction
is inappropriate considering the exceptional rarity of CVCC
syllables and triple consonant clusters generally.
'Only by extending the phonetic possibility of the two words
containing CVCC syllables to the phonemic level generally
could the geminate analysis be made to function. Such an
extension is an arbitrary device for achieving a theoretically dubious result,
1.3.4Segmental analysesVarious segmental analyses have been proposed for stop contrasts in non-Pama-Nyungan and Yolngu languages, with parameters such as voiced/voiceless, long/short or fortisllenis
used to describe the opposition. Only the fortis/lenis
analysis is common in the literature,11
In terms of the complexity it requires in the overall phonology, a segmental analysis appears to be no more 'simple'
than others, by adding four more segments to the phoneme
inventory and not implicitily incorporating an account of
where the contrast is neutralized.
In their basic form,
however, segmental analyses are not particularly abstract
and define a phonemic distinction on the grounds of articulation: a distinction between two phonetically different
types of stops is directly reflected by phonemic symbols.lo Consonant cluster and syllable types are discussed in
2.1.1-3.
l1 Descriptions using the terms at least are to be found
for Djapu (Morphy 1983), Ngalakan (Merlan 1983) Mangarayi
(Merlan 1982), Dhuwal (Heath 1980a), Ritharngu (Heath 1980b)
and Ngandi (Heath 1978a),Segmental approaches vary widely, and a choice must be made
between analysing the contrast directly as one of voicing,
as in B.M. Lowe's original analysis for Gupapuyngu (nod. in
Morphy 1983:13) or as fortis stops contrasting with lenis
stops, as in various languages studied by Heath and referred
to earlier, and also for Djapu (Morphy 1983).
A recent
analysis of Waray (Harvey 1986:28-34) also contrasts long,
short and geminate stops.
While Heath does not discuss the potential choice of analyses, Morphy (ibid.) rejects voicing and chooses the fortis/
lenis analysis on the grounds that, because voicing is predictable for the environments where the contrast is neutralized, it is not the basis for the phonemic distinction.
Stops in Djapu are voiced following nasals, voiceless syllable-finally and following a glottal stop, and vary freely
between voiced and voiceless word initially.
She argues
that because voicing is a predictable or variable feature in
environments where there is no contrast, it cannot be the
relevant feature where the contrast occurs (Morphy 1983:
16-17),'although such an argument would appear not to be
strongly conclusive. The exact nature of the contrast is in
the end left open, while the terms fortisllenis to distinguish the two types of stops are still maintained.12
The segmental analysis is chosen by Morphy because it adds
only one phoneme to the phoneme inventory. In other languages such as Ngandi, Ritharngu or Dhuwal studied by Heath,
it adds a considerable number of stops to the inventory.l2 Djapu happens to be one Yolngu language which has only a
remnant of the original stop contrast remaining; apart from
the retroflex stop, voiced (or lenis) stops in other dialects have been lenited to glides in Djapu, and are no longer contrastive as stpps (Morphy 1983).","[61, 62, 63]"
"Dorsal consonants are relatively unremarkable.
(iv)
Although usually dorso-velar, the nasal / g / can be realized
as dorso-palatal in word-initial position preceding the
front vowels /i/ and e , producing a distinct following
palatal glide. The dorso-velar articulation occurs in more
rapid speech. In general, the dorso-palatal variant can be
seen as a form of fronting, in assimilation to a following
high vowel in stressed position.
The word b i k i n 'lizard
sp.' has also been recorded occasionally with a dorso-palatal stop preceding an unstressed /i/ vowel. Harvey's field
notes for Wagiman show a large number of such examples, but
they are rare in the speech of the people from whom the
current data was recorded.
The two rhotics are also unremarkable phonetically: the apical tap is slightly post-alveolar, and is
yer a trill, while the glide is a post-alveolar a3proxima b i , with distinct rhotic colouring. However, the tap varies with a post-alveolar glide articulation identical with
the glide phoneme itself. Because some words contain a
glide which cannot be articulated as a tap, and a minimal
pair for /r/ and /rr/ has also been recorded, a distinct
phonemic' contrast can be justified. An asymmetrical neutralization of the rhotic contrast thus occurs, but the
*Dixon (1980:334-346) proposes as part of the historical
development of Pama-Nyungan pronoun forms an assimilation of
the same sort, where velar nasals eventually become palatal
before the high vowel i . The Wagiman data would seem to
provide some concrete synchronic evidence of this type of
assimilation in Australian languages, and thus partial support for Dixon's historical analysis.
\phonetic or other (possibly discourse or style level) environment for the articulation of the tap as a glide is not
clear.
The functional load of the contrast is extremely
restricted, and the recorded minimal pair would also not
appear to be open to potential contextual ambiguity, since
it is 'pubic hair' (gurrun) contrasting with 'sun' (qurun),
Consonant contrasts1.2Consonant contrasts occur over different points and manners
of articulation.
There are in general very few recorded
minimal pairs, both for point and type of articulation;
oppositions without minimal pairs are thus illustrated as
far as possible with the contrasting segments surrounded by
similar or identical environments.

Contrasts involving the glottal stopThe glottal stop occurs predictably in certain lexical and
phonetic environments, and is always syllable final; rare
examples occur where it is unpredictable in word-final and
medial position. Most commonly it occurs as the final element of the penultimate syllable of certain participles (see
9.1 and Figure 9-1 below), where it is preceded by any of
the liquids (111, /rr/, /r/) and the glides /y/ and / w / , andis always followed by a nasal; this environment can be stated as /(L) A , where 'L' is any liquid or /y/ or /w/. In
one nominal example (yibnlbay'ma 'Mick Huddleston') it also
occurs following a glide and preceding a nasal, but this is
a non-contrastive environment for other consonants, as LCC
(and CCC) clusters are not permitted. Another non-contrastive but unpredictable example is found in rifya 'no'. Other
predictable examples occur in intervocalic position in a
small number of words which have sequences of identical
vowels, such as na'an 'water'.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"
"Iwithout appropriate context, and often speakers will provide
translations of the same example with both 'the' and 'that1.
An appreciation of the context of these examples is thus
important for their appropriate translation. Because many
examples given here were recorded without much previous
context (due to the fact that they may have been elicited
translations of English sentences, but also because of the
difficulties involved in recording more spontaneous utterances in the field), there is often an indeterminacy of
translation ranging from examples where ga'an is obviously a
definite article, to examples where it is obviously a demonstrative. There are also the examples which fall somewhere
in between these two poles. In all cases, ga'an is glossed
as 'that1, and any definite article interpretation is given
in the free translation following the example.","[132, 133]"
"There are eight different verb past tense suffixes. It is
doubtful whether these can be considered as representing
conjugation class markers because some occur with only one
or two verbs, although others occur with more.
Verb
'classes' are discussed in Chapter 8, while the present
section deals with the meaning and function of suffixes,
rather than the implications for verb class membership.
The use of any suffix to indicate tense or aspect is optional; when a suffix does occur, the verb becomes relatively
marked for the meaning carried by the suffix. However,
unsuffixed verbs can carry the same meaning as those which
are suffixed, depending on discourse context. For example,
imperative utterances can have immediate future reference
without necessarily having the Immediate future suffixattached to them, while present time can be expressed without the Present tense suffix. The effect of these suffixes
is therefore one of explicit reference to time or aspect,
and their use restricts the contextual interpretation open
to the hearer.
When they are not used, discourse context or other factors
provide information on time andnmanner of action, but their
lack of occurrence also permits a more vague or indeterminate statement of tense or aspect in utterances where the
speaker considers it not important to state it explicitly.
Another feature seems to be that the information that would
have been explicitly coded by the suffix is considered by
the speaker to be shared, or easily recovered from context,
by the discourse participants. In contrast, the more highly
marked, suffixed, verbs provide a specific, unambiguous
statement of 'when' and 'how' in relation to the action.
The tenselaspect suffixes form a functional group on the
grounds that they express simultaneous tense and aspect
functions. Most are restricted to occurrence with one type
of mood or aspect prefix: the Past habitual occurs only
with Perfective prefixes, the Non-past Habitual with Imperfective prefixes, and the Immediate future with Potential
prefixes. The Past punctual suffix can occur with either
Perfective or Imperfective prefixes.
The Present tense suffix only occurs with the Imperfective
prefixes, and the Past tense suffixes with Perfective prefixes. The Reflexive/Reciprocal suffixes occur with only one
prefix series each, and match the prefix in mood and aspect.
The Progressive aspect suffix -min is the sole aspect-only
suffix, and can occur with all three prefix types.
The following sections illustrate the meaning off all suffixes when used alone on a verb. Relevant suffixes and
their morpheme
gloss are underlined
in examples.
Constructions involving more than one suffix are described
separately in section 7.2.5.","[198, 199]"
"%There is no exclusive/inclusive distinction marked on ldu or
lpl forms, but the Plural inclusive suffix -gana can be
attached. to the finite verb complex to indicate inclusive
reference. -gana has also been once recorded suffixed to
the lpl pronoun and occasionally to a verb marked for 3pl.
The use of this suffix on verb complexes does not seem to
imply that non-singular pronouns are otherwise interpreted
as exclusive, but rather that -4ana reinforces the notion of
inclusion or group activity which is already part of the
meaning of these pronouns (cf. 6.4.3).
5.2Possessive pronounsThe Possessive pronouns are used adnominally in an NP to
mark another nominal as being the genitive head (the possessor) of that NP. They are also used alone to indicate that
a contextually determined, but linguistically unspecified,
item is possessed by the referent of the pronoun. In this
way, they can be either an attributive member of a genitive
NP in a clause, or direct arguments of the predicate when
their head is unspecified.
Possessive pronouns can be marked with case and other nominal suffixes. Only +,he unmarked, Absolutive root forms are
given in Figure 5-2; case-marked and other suffixed forms
are predictable from the root.
Figure 5-2Possessive pronounssingulardualplural1qanipgin4fW a U g i ngedogin2gogin
uu~gugingodogin-giwugodogin3nullginbodogin-giwubodoginUnlike the Base pronouns, the Possessive pronouns have forms
for 3sg and 3pl. However, parallel with the Base pronouns
series, a distinct dual form exists only for first person;'
I'2du' and '3du' are formed with the use of the 'Pair' suffixes. There is also a possible alternation between the 2sg
forms gogin and q q g u g i n , which be considered the result of
a back-formation from the 2sg Oblique pronoun form quggu.
This is discussed further in 5.3 below.
When the genitive head is an overt free nominal, the Possessive pronoun usually agrees with it for singular or plural
number, and both the possessed nominal and the genitive head
form elements of a single NP. With the generally free order
of modifier and head elements of most NPs, there is the
potential for ambiguity of whether the modifer is part of
the head or the possessed item. Furthermore, when both the
genitive head arad the possessed item are 3sg or 3p1, the
Possessive pronoun could potentially refer to either the
possessor or the possessed nominal.
In practice, however, such ambiguities do not seem to
This seems to .be for two reasons. First, the genearise.
ral pragmatics of possession are usually such that hearers
know which particular items are the possessed and the possessor. On these grounds, a very broad linguistic statement
can be made that in many genitive NPs there are usually an
animate (and possibly human) item and a non-human or inanimate item. It is much more likely for the human to be the
possessor and the inanimate item the possessed element,
rather than the reverse.","[114, 115, 116]"
"A remaining difficulty is its consistent syllable-final
behaviour, however. Despite the evidence that it is currently a boundary signal, it does not always occur exactly on
the boundary. In class (ii) participles (cf. Figure 1-31,
for example, the glottal stop only occurs on the boundary
when there is either suffixation or the Punctual soot form
occurs (see also 9.4).
In the unmarked form, it precedes
the root-final nasal, which is then the 'boundary' as a
result of its movement backwards to be syllable-final. It
is possible, as suggested by Merlan (1983:7), that the boundary signal function of the glottal stop was more definite
in the past, and historical changes have obscured it somewhat.
A transcriptional consequence is that the glottal stop need
only be marked in those examples where it cannot be predicted. However, for ease of pronunciation it is included in
all words in which it has been recorded.
1.5Vowel phonologyThere are five phonemic vowels, which are relatively simple
in their distribution and behaviour; they are given in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-4Vowel phoneme matrixfrontbackhighiumideolowa63Most vowels have more than one phonetic realization, although the mid vowels show significantly less variation than
the others. Realizations of the vowels are as follows:
/i/ is realized as a high front unrounded
vowel [i] in open syllables, and as a short, tense, lower
and less fronted vowel [I] in closed syllables and preceding
a phonetic glottal stop.
/el is almost always realized as the mid front
unrounded vowel
but in unstressed syllables it has a
tendency to be articulated as more of a central vowel, approaching (but not reaching) the articulation of [a].[el,(iii)
/a/ has a range of allophones: a low front
unrounded vowel [m]following lamina1 consonants in unstressed position; a slightly higher short central unrounded
vowel [A] in unstressed position elsewhere, and in stressed
position in polysyllabic words or preceding a phonetic glottal stop; a longer, ].ow, slightly fronted unrounded vowel
[a] in stressed position in disyllabic words; bnd a low,
back rounded realization [a] between /w/ and another (dorso-)velar consonant.
/o/ has really only one articulation: the low
mid rounded back vowel [Dl. This can be slightly long in
stressed position.
(iv)(v>
/u/ has little variation, and is usually realized as a short high back vowel [a]. In unstressed position
following the velar glide /a/ it can be slightly lower, and
similar to [O].
1.5.1Vowel contrastsAll five vowels contrast in all word positions, although
minimal pairs are again rare. Where they are not available,
sub-minimal pairs can be used as strong evidence of a contrast. Pairs which show contrasts of the first vowel in theword (V1 position) are more common than for vowels in other
word positions. For non-V1 position (V2 and later), pairs
which exhibit even syllabic opposition are extremely rare.
However, the same V1 contrasts can be maintained in other
word positions on the basis of similar phonetic realizations
for these vowels.
Examples are taken mainly from nominal and adverbial roots.
Bird names have also been avoided as they tend to contain
vowels which can be analysed as iconic representations of
the bird1s call.

apart from this word and those given above, no others. One

given by Don Liddy Balambal as nirra-mag, with no gender
prefix.
6.4Number marking nominal suffixesThe Pair, Plural and Inclusive suffixes given in figure 7-3
above can be used on finite verbs, as well as on nominals,where their have a similar function: they mark one of the
referents of the pronominal prefix as having the semantic
value carried by the particular suffix.
Such bi-valency
should not be seen as unusual in a language in which information concerning the actants in a clause is often carried
only by the prefix, and in which free nominals are not req.uired syntactically.
In order to avoid duplication of description, the finite
verb use of these suffixes will be described here, rather
than in Chapter 7 on finite verb affixing morphology. When
they occur on finite verbs, number suffixes are usually the
last item following tense and aspect suffixes; if there are
none, they directly follow the root.
6.4.1Pair suffixes -giwu, -gudyuThere are two synonymous forms of the Pair suffix, both of
which seem to be used by all speakers.
Both forms are used
to mark nominals as either being one member of a pair, or as
actually consisting of a pair. In the latter function they
can effectively be dual number markers, but their use also
goes beyond this.
The following two examples were recorded in the same session
with Douglas Jack Milguyarri, and illustrate the apparent
synonomy of these suffixes:
6-96labali-gndyu maf-gin
leg-PAIR
this-PAIR[DJM 4841'These are two legs,'9There is some variation of'use amongst.speakers, however.
Douglas Jack Milguyarri and his sister Lulu martin Dalpalngali use -gudyu suffixed to nominals more than do Don Liddy
Balambal and the Huddleston family in Pine Creek. -gudyu,
for example, was recorded only once from Don Liddy Balambal,
suffixed to a verb rather than a nominal,6-97[DJM 4841mae-giru, mae-gudyu labali
this-PAIR this-PAIR leg
'These are two legs.'6-98 is also typical of dual number marking function; such
examples can just as easily be translated as 'that pair',
however, preserving the 'pair' meaning:
6-98gan-gin
that-PAIRba-bu-ni
3pl:PFV-hit-PASTgaean lamarra

dog[DLB 831
'Those two hit the dog. '1These suffixes are also used to form second person dual
forms from 2pl Base pronouns, and can also mark lpl Base
pronouns in the same way, notwithstanding the existence
The following
already of separate ldu forms (cf. 5.1).
examples were elicited from English sentences (as is apparent from their similar and rather unnatural English translations).
Overt free pronouns would not normally occur in
this way; usually only the finite verb would be marked,
either with the ldu prefix or, for 2du, with the Pair suffix
only :
6-99gego-gin
1pZ-PAIRgin-bu-n
1du:IPFV-hit-PRESgaean lamarra
that
dog'We two are hitting that dog. I
6-100qogo-giru
2pl-PAIRgityiya mu-bu-gim
today
2pl:POT-hit-PAIRlmarra
dog[DLB 831ga @ an
that'You two will hit that dog today.'
In virtually all elicited examples where the speaker was
asked for translations of English dual number, a Pair-marked
free pronoun occurs with a similarly marked finite verb, in
what seem to be sentences which unduly emphasise the dualnumber marking in Wagiman. This merely represents, in fact,
speakers' attempts to translate what they saw as an artificially emphasised feature of the English source sentences.
The problem with such examples is that they are produced
completely out of context, and could only be produced naturally in a quite different setting.
It is also possible to mark one of two non-identical free
nominals in a clause as being a pair in some way. In example 6-101, the old man and old woman make up a pair because
they were alone together at the time of the example, but
also because they are a married couple of long standing and
are well known as always being together. This example is
extracted from a short text by Paddy Huddleston Benbo, and
also contains a Pair suffix attached to the finite verb:
6-101qalmatiwa
old womanmaluga-gin
old man-PAIRba-di-nya-giwu
3pl:PFV-come-PAST-PAIRwil'ma
walk[PHB 831'The old man and woman walked along.'
When they occur on an intransitive verb and do not reflect
any overt nominal in the clause, these suffixes express dual
number marking for the subject, as in example 6-101 above
and the following examples:
6-102gi-ya-giru
1pl:IPFV-go-PAIRril'ma
walkdnbay
downbora-ga
river-ALL[DLB 831
'We are walking down to the river.'
6-103mu-ya-gudyu
2pl:POT-go-PAIR[DJM 7841'You two fellows are going.'
Another function of the Pair suffixes is to express a ldu
exclusive meaning, when the addressee of the utterance is
not included in the pronominal reference of a first personnon-singular prefix.
These constructions contain a Pairsuffixed nominal in the clause to indicate that the ldu or
lpl prefix includes that particular nominal and the speaker,
but not the addressee:
6-104mabityparanqi-yu-qinlong time1pl:PFV-be-PASTQueenie-giwu-maga'anlra'anQueenie-PAIR-FOCthatplacega '-ba
there-PER[LMD 1;21]'We spent a long time at that place, Queenie and
I.'
The Pair suffixes can also be used on transitive verbs,
where they can refer to either Agent or Patient of the verb.
As with the intransitive exclusive example above, a Pairmarked nominal in the clause indicates either exclusive or
inclusive status and, if necessary, the grammatical function
of the referent of the Pair suffix on the verb. Such examples are rare, and the following exchange from an elicitation session in 1985 with Lulu Martin Dalpalngali is given as
containing the only examples of this, other than that from
the text given above. Prompts given by the researcher are
prefixed by AC, and Lulu Martin Dalpalngali's replies are
prefixed with LMD. While the prompts are in Wagiman and @re
not contradicted by the speaker, they should not be taken as
necessarily acceptable; in these examples they do not seem
to be unacceptable, however.

"IHowever, the Desiderative prefix is restricted to use only
on verbs which have a lsg nominal marked in the prefix.
A further resultant restriction of meaning is thus to aspectually unmarked Indicative mood, because of the aspect contrast neutralization for lsg forms. The above examples show
that the lsg nominal can be in any grammatical function in
both transitive and intransitive finite verbs. The restriction to lsg reference is presumably due to a grammaticalized
pragmatic restraint, whereby speakers are unable to state
another person's intention unless they are closely involved
in the action. Such close involvement apparently means
being either S, A or 0 in grammatical terms, and participants in some way in semantic terms.
Because it is not possible to use the Desiderative prefix
for clauses which have no 1st person reference involved in
them, there is a potential gap in possibility of expression
in this area.
However, the use of iterative aspect (see
7.2.4.3) with the adverb gorro 'later, tried (but failed)'
provides an interpretation of 'attempt' or 'intend' when
there is no lsg nominal marked in the prefix.
7e2e3'Finite imperative utterancesFinite verb imperative utterances are not marked in any way
morphologically, and are formally identical with 2sg or 2pl
prefixed declarative finite verbs. The distinction between
imperatives and other utterance types is based on intonation and context: imperatives are uttered with relatively
more loudness and pitch.
The Immediate future suffix can
occur on verbs used as imperatives to indicate the speaker's
desire that the action be undertaken at once. A second type
of imperative, discussed in 9.3, can be formed with only a
participle and no finite verb or nominal arguments.",[195]
