[bawan]. Gender is expressed in the question word 'who' : ma for masculine, man for
feminine (see examples ( 1 1 2) and ( 1 1 3)).
The question words listed in ( 1 08) are illustrated in some examples:( 1 09)An-kitiir-o-barna baban?","[23, 24]"
"8 Questions
Questions are marked morphologically. Though questions are not expressed by means of
intonation alone, question-marking clitic -e is realised with a salient, large rising or falling
pitch movement.",[23]
"1 5.2 Other uses of the form rna
The form rna is also used in question words, as shown in (244H246):(244)Maria-nrna-n ?n-yenMaria-3SF 3SF-mother who- 3SF
Who is Maria's mother?",[42]
"3SM-Y-flee like-where 3sF-genitals-body.hair 3SM-around already
How can he escape? Her pubic hair is completely wound around him.
The question word aro-te 'how' is also used in daily conversation to ask how things are
going, next to the common questions an-un si-te? 'where are you going?' and am-bari-te?
'where do you come from?'.",[25]
"The aspectual meaning of the prepositions ku and ma is also reflected when used in
combination with question marker -te 'where' (see also ยง8):( 1 32)An-japku-te?",[27]

alreadyNote that the complex question na ban 'why?' may occur in clause-final position after the
adverb of time.
The adverb pa 'already' preceded by isi 'enough, finished, ready', and usually followed by
be 'but', marks an action that has been completed insufficiently or unsatisfactorily. For
example:(1 88)In-det bar-(d)et isi

"7 Deictics
I n Mpur a distinction exists between spatial and textual deictics, the forms of which occur
in combinations as summarized in Table 4. As we will see, the deictic system is not a simple
issue at all. As said in my introduction, research carried out for the present article was
limited and does not answer many questions I still have, and the examples shown in this
section leave us with a great deal of uncertainty. Table 4 presents the forms of deictics:

(b)a-ta-kamekta(w)
(n)da(w)ni

is not indicated in Table 4. Note that the form ba-ni is used in Amberbaken and, according
to my Kebar consultant, equivalent to the Kebar form ka-ni.
Spatial deictics are expressed by the basic demonstrative pronouns ki 'here/this' and ka
'there/that' referring, respectively, to a distance near and a distance further away from the
speaker. The demonstratives are illustrated in the following example:(80)Ah n-bwar kananpan-bwarkian-bwar jan.ah I SG-say that you already I SG-say this 2SG-say
Ah, I already told you, I said don't you say anything.notThe basic demonstratives ki and ka are frequently prefixed by what is likely the
morpheme n '3SF'. They are shown in three nominal clauses:(8 1 )Baban n-ka?",[20]
"2.5 Intonation
Some intonation patterns have been dealt with in Ode ( 1 996, 1 997). A description of
Mpur tones and intonation is still in progress and will be published separately. For the time
being only some limited notes on intonation are presented.
A general tendency is observed to realise large pitch movements at prosodic boundaries (a
pause, silence, hesitation, reset), for which the final syllable is then lengthened. At the end of
declaratives pitch usually moves downwards. Interrogatives and continuations cannot be
expressed by intonation alone: interrogatives take question markers (ยง8) which have their
'own' tones, and enclitics are used to express a continuation (ยง 1 6). The importance of a word
in an utterance, as a means of accent, is highlighted by focus marker ni (see ยง7), by enclitics
or by repeating words (of most word classes), examples of which can be found in the text at
the end of this article. Enclitics especially have salient falling or rising pitch movements.
The expression of emotive emphasis has been described in Ode ( 1 997, 1 998).",[7]
"2.3 Tones
On the basis of an experimental phonetic approach, described in, for example, Ode
( 1 996), three tones have been attested in Mpur: high, mid and low. The issue still is whether a
fourth midrising tone, existing on the perceptual level, is phonologically significant. The
analysis in progress of the results of a last set of experiments is expected to answer this
question.
Generally speaking, the range between high and low, expressed on a logarithmic scale, can
be up to twelve semitones, which in musical terms is equivalent to one octave. But note that
tones and intonation in speech are not perceived on the same logarithmic scale as music (Ode
1 996: note 1 0). The range between high and low in absolute terms, that is, expressed in
hertz, is of course speaker dependent. Tone sandhi, the influence of tones on the realisation
of adjacent tones, is a normal phenomenon in Mpur that together with other tonal and
intonational phenomena will be described in Mpur tones and intonation: an experimental
phonetic analysis with interlinearized texts (Ode, in process). Downdrift (i.e. in a sequence
of high-low-high tones, the latter high tone is lower than the former) and downstep (i.e. the
phonological lowering of the second of two tones of the same type) are not observed in Mpur.
In spontaneous speech there can be some declination (i.e. the fundamental frequency declines
gradually in the course of an utterance). See also Ode ( 1 996:86).
Table 3 presents the three lexical tones with phonetic specification, that is, the level of the
tone in semitones (ST) measured above the lowest (zero semitones) level of a register of
twelve semitones of a speaker, and examples. These are maximum values. The actual
realisation of tones can be higher or lower than indicated in the table, depending on utterance
position, melodic context, tone sandhi, intonation and the idiosyncrasy of the speaker. High
and low tones are marked with ' and ' , respectively, on vowels; mid tone remains unmarked.",[6]
"2.2 Syllable structure and phonotactics
The syllable structure in monosyllabic words is as follows:50Cecilia Ode
v
CV
VC
CVCpa
am
kurto stand
already
eye
snakeConsonant clusters do not occur in syllable-final position and are rare in syllable-initial
position, except C + semivowel. One can even question whether initial consonant clusters are
in fact the result of vowel elision, as, for example, in from 'think ', and thus not
monosyllables.
In polysyllabic words, consonant and vowel clusters occur over syllable boundaries:v-v
CV-V
V-VC

"14 Classifiers
Mpur has a large number of classifiers that are obligatory in combination with numerals
which they precede. Though I don't know their exact number, I found over twenty different
classifiers. For example, bik for counting houses andfi for counting persons and animals:(226)janbikdenurhouse CLF three
three houses(227)ntonfirokir

testicles1 5 Relativisation and the form ma
The form rna is observed in various languages of the Bird's Head area. Reesink
( 1 998:626ff.) discusses the different functions of mao To supplement his article I present
some other functions which rna has in Mpur, in addition to sections 7- 1 0 where the form has
also been discussed.
My informants indicated that preposition rna 'at, to' and ma as relative marker have
different tones: high tone and mid tone, respectively. I analysed many examples of rna and
found that in both functions the tone realised in context fluctuates considerably; pronounced
in isolation I did not find any difference in tone: both were realised with mid tone. The form
is so frequently used, that a discrete difference in tone would have been noticed.
For the time being, the different rna, which, in spite of native speakers' judgements, are
considered homophonous, to be distinguished are:
(a)as relative marker, introducing relative clauses;(b)as relative marker in Headless RC, resembling a nominalising particle;(c)on attributive adjectives in RC;A sketch ofMpur
(d)as marking demonstratives;(e)in question words (examples (244}-(246));(f)as preposition (example (247)).","[39, 40, 41]"
"Other examples are (203) and (204), in which two clauses are coordinated by constrastive
be 'but'. The negative adverb has to be in final position of the clause under its scope.",[35]
"This utterance can be disambiguated by positioning the negative element directly following
the predicate of the main clause:(202)De-unot jan Seppi-a a-jap
ku Bwatem.
3PL-know not Seppy
3sM-live in Saukorem
They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem.",[35]
"6.7 Nouns with the same form as verbs
A number of nouns in Mpur have the same form as verbs with subject prefixation. For
example sor 'mountain/cross' and tum 'arrow/shoot' :(74)In-sordok.",[19]

"2 Phonology
Mpur is a language with lexical tone contrasts. To my knowledge it is, together with the
neighbouring Abun language (Berry & Berry 1 999), the only Non-Austronesian tone
language in the Bird's Head area.
A detailed phonology of Mpur by G. Kalmbacher is in preparation, of which a draft
(Kalmbacher 1 996) was kindly offered to me by the author. The data presented here do not
necessarily agree with all data in Kalmbacher's phonology. This is especially the case with
respect to word stress and the tone system, but differences will not be discussed. Full
responsibility for this short phonology is mine.",[4]
"4.7 Emotive verbs with waThere are a number of verbs expressing mental or physiological states with the initial
syllable wa-, mostly for negative feelings such as warmor 'to be angry', wanaw 'to be afraid',
wafnem 'to be lazy', waka 'to be jealous', wamar 'to be tired', wandar 'to be shy', wantek 'to
be ill '. The verb mom (see ยง4.6) also occurs with wa-: wamom 'to want not'. I have no
explanation yet for the origin of wa-. According to my language consultants the form wa
comes from wow 'body' or mwan 'face, appearance', for instance: wamar 'to be tired'
consists of wow-mar 'body-tired', wantek 'to be ill ' is claimed to be mwan-tek 'face-hot'.
Two examples are:58Cecilia Ode

3DU-Y-runmek.deep there
3SF-enter k.o.tree 3SM-ANA hole
She went inside the deep hole of that mamer tree.
The forms (n-)ka and (n-)ki and mek can be specified further with elements from textual
deictics and other forms. This is discussed below.
Textual deixis is indicated by anaphoric ta and focus/topic marking ni, the latter most
likely of Numforese origin. Both can be prefixed with a- or ba-. For the time being, I
interpret a as '3SM ' ; but note that the origin of ba- seems to be bar 'thing', where intitial b- is
often omitted. The forms ba-ta, a-ta and ba-ni, as well as a number of more complex forms
(see below), occur equally frequently in my materials. A focus-marking form a-ni is in a
single case attested. Anaphoric ta can also be found in the free personal pronoun yeta '3SM'.
Sometimes ta is followed by a semivowel /w/: taw. The form nda 'that/there' does not occur
without n in my materials; it can also be followed by a final semivowel /w/: ndaw. A form
da is only attested with the meaning 'first, earlier', and as such is related to anaphoric ta o It
seems likely that nda consists of n '3SF' and anaphoric ta, where the initial stop is voiced
after n.
Examples of textual deictics are presented in the following examples:(86)Mamir mautbiasaa-tade-kum.person REL dead 3SM-ANA usually 3PL-smoke

instance, put tu put tu 'day one day one' for 'always' or kiti kiti 'sometimes' are also used.

1.1 Background of the Mpur language
Mpur is a Non-Austronesian language with three lexical tones and is spoken by
approximately 5 ,000 speakers in the north east Bird's Head area, Irian Jaya, Indonesia. In
the literature Mpur is sometimes referred to as Kebar or Amberbaken, which are geographic
names for the two regions where it is spoken.
Mpur is a phylum-level isolate with dialectal differences in at least lexicon and prosody
between speakers in the Kebar Valley, in the mountains (East Kebar) and on the coast
(Amberbaken), respectively. The lexicon is of Papuan origin, but morphology and syntax
show Austronesian features (Reesink 1 998 :603ff.), such as subject-verb-object word order
and the absence of heavy verb morphology. Many loans entered Mpur from Numforese,
Irianese Malay, Standard Indonesian, and also some from Dutch. I ndonesian is taught in
village schools by non-Mpur teachers, but they play truant as much as Mpur children do. In
town Mpur children learn I ndonesian more properly and only they are fairly able to
distinguish between Indonesian and Mpur words. Only a few Mpur speakers are literate in
Mpur, though much progress has been made in Kebar since G. and C. Kalmbacher (Irian Jaya
Bethany Foundation and Summer Institute of Linguistics) began to give literacy courses with
educational materials in the villages of that area; literacy in Indonesian is much better.
Speakers of Mpur do not know the origin of the name Mpur. Coastal Mpur speakers refer
to Mpur speakers in the Kebar Valley as ma-ye 'who are outside' (lit. REL-outside), that is, at
the other side of the eastern Tamrau mountains. Kebar people call Papuan people maksam,
most likely from mam-kesam 'person from Irian' (lit. person-big.forest), in contrast to matem
'white people' from mam-war-tem 'person-mouth-river'. So far I have no explanation for the
term Mpur which is only used to refer to the language.
The Mpur-speaking community has been extensively described by Miedema ( 1 9 84) and
many examples of their oral tradition have been published in M iedema ( 1 997). The story
Kaman ja 'Squash seeds', for the first time presented in this article, is an old story but a new
item to Miedema's collection.","[1, 2, 3]"
"A similar contrast as between ( 1 64) and ( 1 65) seems to apply to postnominal be-nek in
( 1 66) and the adverbial a-nek in (1 67):( 1 66)A -jap be jan
be-nek.
3SM-sit LOC house LOC-earth
He sits under the house.",[30]
"(90)Ahmamir n-dapa.ah person 3SF-ANA already
Ah, somebody is there.
The deictic system in M pur shows a large number of complex forms consisting of
elements of spatial and textual deictics. The demonstratives ki, ka and mek can be further
specified and be prefixed with anaphoric (b)a-ta, with what is likely the preposition na 'to,
for', and they can be suffixed with topic/focus marker ni. All these forms can occur as
object of a preposition. The combinations are shown in the examples below:(9 1 )Seluruh yenba-ta-mekn-ketetsik.all
needle ?-ANA-there 3SF-release impossible
She could not release (it) with any needle over there at all.",[22]
"A sketch ofMpur 67
The conjunction aka '(and.)then ' probably consists of a-ka '3SM-that' (a form *a-ki was
not observed):( 1 00)Naria-naaka a -retwor.in.a.while 3SM-come then 3SM-eat
He will come and eat us.","[22, 23]"
"3SM-ill
so
3SM-go to garden not
He is ill, so he will not go to the garden.
The conjunction mintaki can occur either in initial or in final position of an utterance and
is a general discourse-cohesive conjunction with the meaning 'having arrived at this point of
the story, things were like that' and anticipating that things are yet to come. The form is
illustrated in the following examples:(220)Min-ta-kipu-tun-unna m-banjep.like-ANA-this day-one 3sF-go for 3SF-split firewood
And so one day she went to cut firewood.",[37]
"3PL-vBL-begin 3PL-sharpen bamboo
They began to sharpen bamboos.",[60]

Appendix
Kamanja 'Squash seeds'
The story Kaman ja 'Squash seeds' perfonned by Markus Wabia (about 4 0 years old) was
recorded on digital tape and on video in the village of Saukorem on the north-east coast of
the Bird's Head, 1 6 March 1 994.
Notational conventions are as follows. Underlined text is Saukorem dialect, bold text is
Indonesian. Loans from Numforese are indicated with (NF), but not all entries have been
checked against the Numforese vocabulary. Semivowel insertion between vowels is indicated
with Y. First lines present the original text in italics, second lines the analysis in morphemes,
third lines the free English translation. The speech rate changes in the course of the story.
When in the original text syllables are swallowed and morphemes cannot be recognised
anymore, an extra line is added in italics below the original text as if it were pronounced in
careful speech. Vowels or consonants that are not pronounced are presented in parentheses.
Stem-initial Idl preceded by a prefix ending in a vowel is pronounced as [r]; this may also
occur in connected speech if a preceding word ends in a vowel. In the text I followed the
actual pronunciation of Idl as [d] or as [r]. Likewise I followed the pronunciation of wordยญ
initial In! before bilabials as [m] and of fbi in the deictic elements (a)bata and bani where fbi
can be pronounced as [w]. Duration of pauses between utterances is indicated in seconds
between square brackets on the first line. For the convenience of the author's administration,
utterances are numbered according to the sound files as they were stored for analysis in the
computer.

existence of the tree was already known to the listener. Informants are not consistent in their
explanations; this has to be checked further. For a discussion about the many puzzling
functions of ma the reader is referred to ยง 1 5 .
Next to (n-)ka 'there' a form mek 'there' exists. This demonstrative seems t o be used for
distances more remote than (n-)ka . Two examples are:(84)Do-tekkane(k)-mekarwar mek3DU-down that down-there stairs
They went down the stairs and ran.","[20, 21]"
"Note that in examples ( 1 60) and ( 1 6 1 ) am 'side' and am 'eye' have mid and high tone,
respectively.
Besides ( 1 6 1 ) and ( 1 63) it is also possible to inflect jun 'top' with '3SF' in case an
anchoring noun is present, as in ( 1 62) and ( 1 64), or with '3SM ' when this is not the case( 1 65).

Female personal names are suffixed with -n: Amandan, Mincen, Marian 'Amanda,
Mince, Maria '. M ale personal names are suffixed with -a : Seppia, Mosesa, Lamberta

criminal6.4 Alienable nouns
There are two possessive pronouns which are used with alienable nouns. Both -tar and -bi
always precede the noun. The possessive morpheme bi is identical to the Abun form (see
Berry & Berry 1 999:78). Examples of alienable nouns in a context with possessive pronouns
are presented below:(67)In-unsi n-tarjan.","[16, 17, 18]"
"Note that in example ( 1 55) n-dumom '3SF-front.of.body' may be omitted.
When no anchoring noun is available, the locative phrase consists of just the preposition be
plus the spatial noun, consider:( 1 56)An-rer bar-(dJet be-u.
2SG-put eat-thing Loc-inside
Put the food inside.",[29]
"2.4 Stress
In polysyllabic words, a syllable can be more prominent than its surrounding syllables,
especially if it has high tone or a relatively longer duration. Yet there is no evidence that
lexical stress in Mpur is phonologically significant. In a pilot experiment conducted in the
field, I observed that no regular pattern of realised prominence of syllables exists. In
different contexts one and the same word may even show shifting prominence without
expressing a contrast.",[7]
"1 1.8 To be or be not: the presentative mu
The presence or existence of something is expressed by the presentative mu with verbs like
ut 'to stay', i 'to stand', jap 'to sit' or kon 'to lie, sleep'. The word class it belongs to is not80Cecilia Odeclear to me, so for the time being the presentative is discussed in this final section on adverbs.
The most frequent use is in combination with the verb ut 'to stay' forming the compound
construction umu and with the demonstratives ka 'that.there' and ki 'that.here'. Mu is always
preceded by a verb. Though its use is not yet clear to me, the presentative is shown in a few
examples:(205)pa.mu-kia-IFentor-aFentor-3SM 3SM-stand present-here already
Fentori is here already.","[35, 36]"

"4.3 Verb sequences
Sequences of verbs are a common phenomenon in Mpur. They occur without any
conjunction and all verbs in such a sequence are finite and thus obligatorily inflected.
There are a few criteria according to which sequences of verbs in Mpur actually could be
cases of verb serialisation: conjunctions do not occur between the verbs, a clause boundary
occurs only after the last verb, the subject is the same for all verbs, verbs may also occur
individually in a clause, verbs form together a prosodic group (no pauses between verbs, a
single intonation contour). Three examples are:(27)Do-undo-mimdo-fasubweAri-a a-tem.",[11]
"The adverbfanam also occurs as verb and takes subject prefixation:(1 72)do-bwanjar per.

"There are no indigenous words for ' week', 'month' or 'year'. Mpur speakers use
I ndonesian words, but for 'year' the compound bra-n-ka-wa is sometimes used, from
classifier bra for long things, demonstrative pronoun n-ka '3SF-that' and aspect adverb pa
'already'. For 'month' the form man is used from the Dutch loan maand.",[32]

In addition to the rather general locative prepositions, discussed in ยง9, Mpur employs a
number of spatial relator nouns to specify the spatial orientation of an object. Some of these
are clearly nouns in their own right, such as bwan 'hole', others transparently refer to body
parts, such as dir 'rib', again others can be classified as nouns, because they occur as object
of the preposition be. This preposition has not been discussed in ยง7, since it is rather
restricted to locative phrases with or without spatial nouns. Some spatial nouns are included
in this category on the basis of analogy to the items mentioned. That is, if a noun referring to
an object which serves as spatial anchoring point is present, the spatial nouns either followA sketch ofMpur 73
that noun directly, as in (1 50), or with an additional instance of the preposition be, as in( 1 5 1 ).
