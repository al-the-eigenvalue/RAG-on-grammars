"The connective (- )aga also occurs with demonstrative or numeral modifiers when they occur
prenominally (normally these modifiers occur postnominally):
(3. 1 06)meqaro6soi-d-agathat.M.SG-TR-POSS house
that house
(3. 1 07)nagi-agafragiroone-POSS body
twenty(=one body)
There is a number of occurrences of the morpheme -wo in the texts that have been glossed
as CONN (connective). This -wo seems to be different from the nomina lizing morpheme - wo
(see §3 .3.3), the 3SG feminine form -wo of the copular verb ra- (see §3.4) and the locative
postposition -wo (see §4. 1 .2). The function of the connective -wo is not clear. Consider this
example:
(3. 1 08)Qeququ-woqaqa-wotii-we-ge-re +aibo-wora-y-aigoparent.PL-CONN child-CONN silent-3.S-do-PAST voice-CONN say-TR-NEG

Polar questions are marked by rising intonation a nd the optional sentence-final polar
question c 1itic -qe (sometimes -e), (3. 1 09}-(3. 78).
(3 . 1 09)Mutero-go ge-reqa-sa-e?one-CTRC ) PLINC.S-gO.PL-FUT-Q

Could the boy read?",[62]
"The words eise 'yes' and (qe)q[do 'no' can stand on their own 8 as complete utterances in
conversations but (qe)qfdo is also used as an interclausal conjunction in disjunctive questions,
for example:
(3.62)K6fido e-ri-sa
qeqfdo tero e-ri-sa ?
tea 2SG.S-drink-FUT
coffee 2SG.S-drink-FUT or
Do you want coffee or tea?",[53]
"50Chapter 3Usually just rising intonation is used to mark utterances as polar questions as in the following
dialogue:
(3. 1 1 1 )M urray:

Yunus:
Ebaro-wofclose-be.3SG.F

M urray:

Content questions are marked by rising intonation and a question word that is often but not
always fronted. Consider the following dialogue:
( 3 . 1 1 2)Murray:

The other question words have peripheral functions like instrument, place, time. The
postpositions marking peripheral nominals (Chapter 4) like - wa i 'to(wards)', - wo 'in, at',
-woide 'from', also mark peripheral question words. Examples:

for Scientific Research (NWO) program The I rian Jaya Studies: a programme for
interdisciplinary research (ISIR) headed by Wim Stokhof and as part of the Spinoza (NWO)
research program Lexicon and Syntax headed by Pieter M uysken. The I SI R programme was
carried out in cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia ). Inanwatan was
chosen within the I SI R research program to represent the languages of the southern Bird's
Head, linguistically terra incognita. I collected data in I nanwatan in the first three months of
1 994 and during three months in 1 995.
Thanks are due to Dr Hasan Alwi (Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa, Jakarta)
and to Dr A.O. Atururi (then Bupati of the Sorong regency) for their support and interest in my
research and to Mr Dominggus Murray of Inanwatan for teaching me the Inanwatan language
and for recruiting many excellent informants like Titus Mamary, Bernard Mitogai, Agustinus
Yawae, Set Eramuri and Set Setoge all of whom I thank for their patience and kindness. I
should thank Bert Voorhoeve for giving me his unpublished notes on the Inanwatan language
based on work with an I nanwatan informant in Bintuni, Irian Jaya, in 1 9 82, and the Summer
Institute of Linguistics, at Abepura, for sending me copies of the survey reports of Gravelle
(1986), Berry and Berry ( 1 987) and Kempf (n.d.). Dianne van Oosterhout, who worked as an
anthropologist in I nanwatan for the I SI R project deserves thanks for sharing insights and data
with me. The Benawa word list found in the Appendix 3 was taken by her. She also supplied me
with a number of local Malay texts of the Inanwatan area. M arian Klamer and Ger Reesink
took the trouble to read the whole manuscript critically, and this led to numerous improvements
in the analysis and presentation of the Inanwatan data. Thanks!ixAbbreviations23

"2728Chapter 3allomorphs iti- (with third person subject forms) and -ri (in variation with -iti) in 1 SG and 2SG
forms.
The oblique forms occur sometimes in a longer form (e.g. nagadara in stead of naga).
The oblique forms are used for personal pronouns with peripheral functions in the clause (see
§4. 1 .2 for the distinction between core and peripheral nominals in I nanwatan). The oblique
forms most likely consist of (former) postpositions attached to the personal pronouns. For the
third person forms this is certain: -ra is a postposition meaning 'to, for, about' (see §4. 1 .2).
So far I have not encountered a postposition -ga or -gadara . There are also combinations of
personal pronouns and the postpositions -wai 'to' (direction) and -(u)ru '(together)with'
(comitative):
(3.2)A bo-gona-wai mo-ra.tomorrow-eIRe me-to come-TMP.SG

I have found the emphatic forms so far only combined with non-emphatic subject forms.
Possibly the -wa morpheme in the emphatic forms derives from the proximate demonstrative
element - wa, compare the frequent local Malay emphatic form saya ini literally 'I here'.
Some examples of personal pronouns, object forms (nawe, 3 .5), subject forms (naiti, n iiti,

25The I nanwatan say that in ancient times, there was no sea separating the Bomberai peninsula from the
south coast of the Bird's Head. Just a river flowed where now the MacCluer Gulf is. The Inanwatan talk
about the MacCluer Gulf in river terms: Bintuni is upstream and Sorong is downstream. Tn this line, it is
told how the flood carried some people 'upstream ' in the direction of the Bintuni area and others
'downstream' in the direction of Sorong.
According to the informant M urray, the water surrounded Ouweqau and her family like a high wall, and if
they would answer the caB for help from the rowing people above, the sound of their voices would
immedialtely cause the water to fall on them.
This is a conventional way to end a story. After this line, Mr M urray, who helped me to transcribe this
text, continues.",[114]
"4Chapter J1.2 Transcribing and analyzing speech in bilingual communitiesLinguists collecting a nd transcribing vernacular speech in bilingual communities of
I ndonesia will increasingly observe Malay elements in their transcribed texts. This creates
special difficulties for the field linguist, for example how to separate Malayicized vernacu lar
from M alay in the transcriptions. Consider the following examples from three texts recorded
in I nanwatan. Bold is used in this book for all M alay elements in the data, irrespective of
their status as borrowed elements or code mixes.

ratusThere are two types of Malay forms in such transcriptions of bilingual speech as in
(I. I }--( 1 .4), forms that conform to the patterns of regional Malay spoken i n the Bird's Head
such as sementara and Desember. And forms that violate those patterns such as duaberas in
(1.3) and sikorao-wai in ( 1 . 1 ). I n ( 1 .4) the Malay word lima 'five' occurs i n adapted (niwa)
and non-adapted form (lim a ) within one utterance. Since the deviations from the regional
Malay standards follow from adaptations of these forms in the direction of the vernacular
language, in this case I nanwatan, I will cal1 forms such as duaberas, niwapuru, sikorao-wai
adapted forms and forms l ike duabelas, limapulu, sekola non-adapted forms. Of course,
regional Malay varieties are oral, non-standardized varieties with a lot of variation, not only
horizontal1y, from place to place, but also vertical ly because regional Malay i s a sociolect
continuum with basolects, mesolects and acrolects. I t is normal for texts in local Malay to
mix elements from basolects, mesolects and acrolects. So, the norms are rather flexible.
Nevertheless, forms l ike dua beras, niwapuru, sikorao-wa i are recognized by I nanwatan
speakers as 'bad' Malay when these forms occur in Malay-only genres such as sermons in
church.
'Pure' regional M alay (without code m ixing and without I nanwatan loans) is used i n
church, school and government contexts and as an interethnic lingua franca (see Appendix 2
Texts, Part C for a text in this local M alay). Relatively 'pure' I nanwatan (without code
mixing, but with some Malay loans) is used in certain genres of the oral tradition like the
tugarido genre (clan (gob6) owned heirloom stories, see for example Appendix 2, Texts, Part
A, texts 1 and 2). Continuous, intensive M a lay/lnanwatan mixing is used within the
community as the default means of communication, exemplified by texts 2 and 3 of Part B,
Appendix 2, Texts).
It is to be expected that the I nanwatan morphosyntax is not immune from influence from
the morphosyntax of Malay but since we do not have k nowledge of older stages in the
development of I nanwatan, such influence is hard to assess. For example, nowadays SVO
constituent order occurs in frequent variation with SOY order in I nanwatan clauses but we do
not know what the clause order was before contact with Malay. But it is clear that not only
lexical words but also complete classes of grammatical words or function words have been
borrowed from Malay, for example discourse conjunctions (like baru and j adi see §4.3 .2)
and numerals (see §3.7 and §4.4.4). The inclusive-exclusive distinction in first person plural
,6Chapter Jpronouns and verbs (see Chapter 3 ) very likely derives from contact with Austronesian
languages like Malay and Sekar since only non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea
bordering on Austronesian languages or in close contact with them have the inclusive­
exclusive opposition.","[16, 17, 18, 19]"

may show some reduction in the direction of the [;)] but this is rather rare, even i n fast
colloquial talk. Examples: ['sidEr:>] 'parrot', ['sid;)r:>] 'parrot'; [na'gaw:>] 'my chin', [n;)'gaw:>]
'my chin'. Vowels in unstressed initial syllables of the Y type show reduction in the form of
devoicing, sometimes leading to completely devoiced vowels. Example: L:>'r:>w:>] 'spear',

"1.4 Adaptation in borrowing and in code mixingAdaptation of Malay forms may take place in the context of borrowing, when Malay
elements become part of the I nanwatan language in a diachronic process on the level of the
language system, or in the context of interference, a synchronic process on the level of8Chapter 1language use, when bilingual Inanwatan people speak Malay with Inanwatan patterns
influencing the form of M alay elements. Because of the grand scale code mix ing and
borrowing the boundaries between Malay and I nanwatan are often unclear in the texts that
form the basis for the description of I nanwatan.
When adaptation occurs in borrowing, the adaptation is a imed at fully and smoothly
integrating the Malay element into the I nanwatan language and the adapted form conforms
to the rules of the I nanwatan language. For example sfkorao-wai in ( 1 . 1 ) is good I nanwatan.
W hen adaptation occurs in the context of interference, the adapted forms remain part of
M alay and may be perceived as violating the patterns of (regional) Malay. For example,
duaberas in ( 1 .3) is 'bad' Malay and followed by a repair.
When Malay is the only language used in a communicative situation, for example in
church or when talking to non-Inanwatan people, adaptation is much more marked and much
less accepted than when Malay forms are adapted in code mixing, when speakers such as
Yunus in ( 1 .2) use both Malay and I nanwatan to construct their messages to other Inanwatan
bilinguals such as M urray in ( 1 .2).
The negative attitudes of the community towards adaptation of Malay forms in Malay­
only genres prevent most types of interferential adaptation in these situations. The adaptation
that I noticed is at h igher levels of grammar: the prosodic level a nd the levels
of discourse and surface syntax. For example, certain discursive strategies such as tail-head
linkage (see §4. 3 . 1 ) are used also in local Malay and the typical fall (tail)-rise plus slowing
down/pause phenomena (head) intonation contour of I nanwatan tail-head l inkage is clearly
audible in the M alay tail-head linkages. Lower level adaptations (phonotactic, morphological
and phonemic adaptations of the type kapa/>kQparo) hardly occur or are followed by repairs
in Malay-only genres.
M uysken (2000:3) distinguishes three types of code mixing: 'insertion of material from
one language into a structure from the other language, alternation between structures from
languages and congruent lexicalization of material from different lexical inventories into a
shared grammatical structure'. I n alternating I nanwatan-Malay code m i xing, levels of
interferential adaptation are comparable to the very low levels in Malay-only contexts.
Compare the Malay stretches in examples (l.2b) and ( l .2d) above such as hanya karena bu
dia sendiri disana m ungkin kekurangan kekurangan .","[20, 21]"
"Since none of the allophones of the phonemes Iml and Inl seems to ha ve the widest
distribution or highest frequency, the choice of the nasal realizations as basic allophone is
rather arbitrary. When discussing the orthography with I nanwatan people, they insisted on
distinguishing the oral allophones (represented in the spelling by w, r) from the nasal ones
(m, n). This was so important to them that they asked me to follow their orthographic
proposal in all my publications.
Having discussed the allophones of 1m! and Inl, we give minimal pairs for these phonemes
in (2. 1 6).",[34]

loose their aspectual meaning and seem to function as narrative forms (see for example

"1.3 Types of adaptation occurring in Malay elements(a) Phonemic and allophonic adaptation:lnanwatan has nasal phonemes with oral allophones. The Inanwatan phoneme Inl has
three allophones [n], [rl and [rl. The allophone [nl occurs word-initially and lr/r] word­
medially. The flapped vibrant [rl freely varies with (rl, the rolled vibrant, the latter being the
most frequent realization. Examples: ['ncr:>1 'name', ['a-rEr:>] 'your name', f'nira] 'day' ['nira­
rira] 'each day'. The Inanwatan phoneme Iml has three allophones [ml, [w] and (P]. The
allophone [m] occurs word-initially, [w] medially adjacent to back vowels (i.e. followed
and/or preceded by [0], [u] or [:>]) and [p] elsewhere. Examples: ['muwur::>] 'rivers'; ['napE]
'me (object)'.
Now in foreign words, word-medial [mJ may be pronounced as lw] or [PJ and the initial
[w] of source forms as [m]. Examples: Dutch e m m er 'bucket' is adapted to ('EPEf::>].
Indonesian wakil 'deputy' is adapted to ['makiriJ 'deputy headman (raja)', Indonesian kaca
m a ta 'glasses' is adapted to ['kaowato]; Indonesian limap u luh 'fifty' to Inanwatan
['nipapuru]. Dutch commissie, a term used for the Patipi headmen appointed by the Dutch
administration to rule Inanwatan, is adapted to ['bwisi]. Medial [n] is adapted to [r/r] in
foreign words. For example, the Patipi word inanwatan is adapted both to the word structure
prohibiting final C and CC clusters (>/iminowatanol, by vowel insertions) and to the
allophonic patterns of the Inanwatan language ([i'rar:>watar::>]. Malay II/ is replaced by
Inanwatan Inl with its oral allophones [ric], for example Malay wakil 'deputy' is adapted to
['makiri] 'deputy headman'.
(b) Phonotactic adaptationInanwatan phonotaxis does not allow CC clusters and final C. Vowel insertion and
consonant deletion are employed to adapt foreign words to Inanwatan phonotactics, for
example p6toroti 'pencil' is the adapted form of Dutch po/lood).
(c) A daptation in word stress and intonation contoursInanwatan has unpredictable, lexical word stress. Quite often the word stress of foreign
words changes in borrowed words, e.g. regional Malay pandita>Inanwatan paditae '(male)
minister'. When two Malay utterances are linked by recapitulative strategies reflecting
'Papuan ' tail-head linkages, the intonation contour is adapted towards the typical
fall-rise-pause pattern associated with 'Papuan' tail-head linkage. See §4.3. 1 for Inanwatan
recapitulative linkage strategies.
(d) Semantic adaptationMeanings of foreign words may change, for example Malay kapa/ means 'non-native
boat' in both its adapted form (kaparo) and non-adapted form. Because of the gender systemIntroduction7of I nanwatan, gender-neutral foreign nouns referring to animate entities develop gender­
specific meanings e.g. Malay pandfta 'minister' > Inanwatan paditae 'male minister'.
(e) Morphological adaptationMorphological adaptation can be illustrated with the integration of nouns and verbs in
the I nanwatan morphology.
Gender in I nanwatan nouns is marked by the last vowel, with nouns ending in a front
vowel (Ii!, lei) being masculine and the remaining nouns (ending in 101, lui and la/) feminine.
In a minority of nouns, gender has a semantic basis (male and female). Now borrowed nouns
denoting humans have lei or Iii added when they denote males and 101 when they denote
females, for example Malay guru 'teacher', has the I nanwatan forms gurui '(male) teacher',
guruo '(female) teacher'. I nanimate borrowed nouns are assigned a gender on the basis of
their final vowel, if they end in a vowel. When they end in a consonant, they are assigned a
gender by the addition of 101 or Ie, i!. Examples: ewero 'bucket' « Dutch emmer), kompasi
'compass' « Dutch kompas), kaparo 'ship' « Malay kapaL), potoroti 'penci l ' « Dutch
potlood), pensili « Malay pensil 'pencil'), listriki 'electricity' « M alay listrik), tabQqido
'tobacco' « Dutch tabak). The addition of vowels is done arbitrarily, that is, I have not (yet)
been able to find a semantic or phonetic base for the gender-integration of such non-human
nouns.
I nanwatan has a complex verb morphology. Verbs are inflected for subject person and
number, object person and number, tense, mood, aspect, negation and gender. Subject and
object are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes, with the exception of counterfactual and third
person future forms which have subject suffixes. To integrate foreign verbs into this system,
Malay verbs (like buka 'to open') are productively combined with the verb ge- 'to do' in
complex phrasal verbs (see §4.2. 1 ). Phonologically, the Malay verb and the verb ge- with its
prefixes and suffixes are integrated under one stress contour and the first 1m! of the subject
prefix Ime-I is always realised by the intervocalic allophone [ w ] . Thus buka-we-ge-re
(open-3.s-take-PAST) instead of buka me-ge-re. Another way to integrate Malay verbs found
in the text is to adapt a Malay stem phonologically and then attach affixes to it as in
me-susa-re 'they lamented, wailed' (from regional Malay bersusa 'to lament, to wail ').
These phonological and morphological adaptation processes have drastic effects on the
form of Malay items. In the speech of bilingual members of the I nanwatan community one
can find hundreds of pairs of words with a Malay item alongside its adapted l nanwatan
counterpart. Examples: sfkoraolsekolah 'school', ttiu-goltahun 'year' (in which -go is the
I nanwatan circumstantial postposition), keredidaolkerja 'work ', kapa rolkapal 'ship', fko­
likul 'to follow someone'. Many of these adapted forms have been around for a long time in
the community and have a stable, conventional form. Although adaptation occurs very
frequently not every Malay element occurs in two forms (adapted and non-adapted). Some
words, like sementara 'temporary' in (1.1), always seem to have the same non-adapted form,
even when they are integrated within I nanwatan morphology.","[19, 20]"

Whereas the possessive prefixes undergo vowel-elision before noun-initial vowels, the

sequences are formed, including double vowels, phonetically realised as long vowels, for
example Ine-era-rel 'I said' (['nE: rarE]) contrasting with Ine-ra-rel 'I held' ( ['nHarc]). The
final lei of the subject prefixes assimilates to 101 when the verb stem has an initial 101 or lui.

"Morphology453.5 Adjectives
The adjective, which occurs postnominally, shows gender agreement with the noun it
qualifies in both attributive and predicative uses. When the noun is mascul ine, the adjective
ends in leI, when feminine the adjective ends in 10/, for example sowalolsowale 'good',
badao/badae 'bad', ebaro/eba re 'c1oseby', eseqo/eseqe 'far(away)', tetewoltetewe 'al l ' ,
g[ro/gfre 'long', dowoldowe 'short'.
(3.87)meqaro sowal-ohouse.F good-F
a good house
(3.88)Meqaro ewaisowat-o-wo.house this.F good-F-be.3SG.F
This house is good.
(3.89)F£tgiesaiapew-i-so.banana this.M delicious-M-be.3SG.M
This banana is delicious.
Some adjectives have unpredictable masculine and feminine forms, for example si 'empty
(M)' and lsido 'empty (F)'. The adjective aida 'big' has only one form, used for both genders.
The feminine form of the adjective is also used as the plural form . Some adjectives have
reduplicated plural forms. I n such cases, the feminine form, the default gender, is the basis
,
for the reduplicated form. Examples: qfqe 'new (M)', qfqo 'new (F)', qiqiqo 'new (PL) ; fsido
'empty (F)', isisido 'empty (PL)'.
There is no morphological comparative or superlative. Periphrastic constructions are used
in these contexts:

This man is bigger than that man.
The adjective terewo 'al l ' (3.9 1 ) is used as intensifier with adjectives in predicate position
(3 .92):
(3.9 1 )Awuga-era-era -rotetewo og6-we-de-wo-i.carry-3.S-go.across-come-PAST.3SG.M

The verbs de- and wo- are phonologically and morphologically i ntegrated in the compound
verb dewo- but in phrasal verbs there is only phonological integration. For example, m6go­
'to carry' in (4 . 3 6) is phonologically one word with the inflected second verb. A sign that
these phrasal verb combinations form phonologlcal words is the stress pattern, the bare verb
root attracts the main word stress and the second inflected verb receives secondary stress.
Another sign is that the Iml of the subject prefix me- is always realized by its intervocalic
allophone [w]. The fact that the subject and object prefixes separate the bare verb form the
following inflected verb signals that there is no morphological integration of the two verbs, in
contrast with compound verbs. Complex phrasal verbs frequently occur in the texts (see
Appendix 2), both with two I nanwatan verbs and with a Malay loan or code mix followed by
an inflected form of ge- 'to do' (see § 1 . 3 ).",[70]

"3. 4. 8 Derivation and compounding of verbsAdjectives are productively verbalised by affixing verbal morphology to the masculine
form of the adjective. For example, sowate 'good' is the base for me-sowate-be 'she is good'
(3.S-good-PRES.F). This form may also mean 'she becomes good' and this is a difference with
the predicative adjectives supported by the copular verb -na that do not have the dynamic
reading (see §3.4.7, compare sowa t-o-wo 'she is/was/will be good'). Furthermore, the
verbalised adjectives express the full range of morphological categories (tense, mood, aspect.
gender, person, number) distinctions whereas the predicative adjectives with -na express only
person, number and gender.
I nanwatan has two productive strategies to combine verb roots (see §4.2 . 1 ). The first is to
combine verb roots in compound verbs. The second is to combine verb roots with inflected
verbs in complex phrasal verbs. Causative, (in)transitive and continuative verbs are formed
by both strategies. The first strategy is used to form compound verbs like uwu-ge- 'to cause
to sit', uwu-se- 'to sit continuously':
(3. 80)Qotoqowar-e btiakuko-qai m6-uwu-ge-be.child-M

And I worked and in 1 970 they appointed me head of the village until in
1 972 I received a call again and I stepped down from the office of village
head in order to go to school again and to be an intern in the laboratory of
the General Hospital in Sorong.
I n example ( 1 .6) the verb ge- 'to do' occurs five times. It occurs with the adapted nouns
keredidau 'work ' in ( 1 .6a), sikorao 'school' in ( 1 .6f) and prakteki 'practice' in ( 1 .6g), with
the unadapted Malay alternating code mix kepala Kampong e Desa berhenti dulu in ( 1 .6e)
and with the Malay loan verb angka- 'to appoint' in (l.6b). The verb ge- can be used as an
alternation device, for example kepala Kampong e Desa berhenti dulu d-ge-re in ( 1 . 6e) and
as an insertion device, for example prakteki re-ge-re in ( 1 .6g). When used as an insertion
device, ge- forms complex phrasal verbs with the preceding Malay words (see §4.2.1). Again
the boundary between insertional code m ixing with ge- and borrowing is very hard to draw.
Malay words may be borrowed without adaptation. For example the loan conjunctions
terus, jadi, baru, suda(h), a tau, tapi, dan have various discourse connective functions inInanwatan and are never adapted. But most borrowed elements from open lexical classes
undergo adaptations.
l nanwatan speakers call the process of code mixing Lompat, a Malay verb meaning 'to
jump' and they usually have no problems separating 'speaking Tnanwatan ' from 'speaking
M alay '. For example when asked about utterances as in (1.2d) they will say that Yunus4-de is an allomorph of the Past suffix -re occurring after stem-final Iii (see §3.4.2.1).",[22]

contrasts in identical or near-identical environments and from vowel elision phenomena.
To start with the latter, consider the following data:
(2. 1 7)flepel['?EpE ]foot(2. 1 8)/epe/['EpE]tooth(2. 1 9)Ina-?epel['na-?EpE]my foot(2.20)In-epe/['n-EpE ]my toothIn (2.20), vowel elision takes place: the final vowel of the first singular possessive prefix
Ina-I 'my' is elided before the initial vowel of lepel 'tooth'. But in (2. 1 9) the glottal stop
functions as an initial consonant and blocks vowel elision.
There is contrastive evidence for I?I in (2.2 1 ). Since Ikl is a rather rare sound (the majority
of occurrences is in borrowed words, see below), we have not yet found an example of
contrast in identical environment for Ik/-fl/.

Gender in nouns is determined by the last vowel. Nouns ending in a front vowel (Ii!, lei)
are masculine and the remaining nouns (ending i n lui, 101 and la/) feminine. Phonological
gender systems (in the sense of Corbett 1 99 ] :5 1 ), as found in Inanwatan, have been found
elsewhere in New Guinea (in Torricell i and Lower Sepik families, for example Yimas, see
Foley 1 986, 1 99 1 ). The great majority of nouns is feminine.
I n a minority of nouns gender has a semantic basis (male and female). 3 This c lass
comprises the following nouns. Nouns denoting humans (including k i nship nouns, for
example q% qawaro 'daughter', qotoqaware 'son '). Nouns denoting domesticated animals
(for example mewaqoto 'female dog' , mewaqote 'male dog'). Also included are a number of
inanimate nouns such as human body parts and body fluids (for example aruqo 'blood (of a
female)', aruqi 'blood (of a male»"" orientational nouns which take the human body as point
of reference (for example eduduro 'left (of a female)', eduduri 'left (of a male)', the noun
nero 'name (of a female)"" neri 'name (of a male)' and other nouns associated with the body
(for example awuwuro 'strength (of a female)', a wuwuri 'strength (of a male) , . Although a
minority, these nouns with semantic gender have a high profile i n the language, not only
because of the importance of kinship but also because body related nouns are used in the
expression of a wide range of lexical and grammatical meanings such as reflexivity (§3 . 1 .3),
spatial orientation, cognition (3 .30), emotion (see §4. 1 . 1 , (4.7) and (4.8» and experiential
ex pressions ( 3 . 1 3, 3 . ] 4). Examples:(3.29)lra-gir-ime-wutau-sa-bi.body-skin-M 3.s-kill-FUT-M
He wants to kill himself.",[46]
"1.5.2 NounsI n nouns, number and gender are distinguished. Apart from a class of mostly animate
nouns in which gender has a semantic basis (see examples ( 1 ), (2), (5), (6) , the Kokoda
gender system seems to be a phonological one, with nouns in lei or Iii masculine and nouns
ending in lal, 101 and lui feminine.

(6)da(3oro nige-jomodog.F good-F
a good (female) dog
(7)udinige-jabanana good-M

(8)keninige-jahouse good-M

Just as in I nanwatan, masculine nouns seem to take the feminine form in the plural and
fem inine nouns remain unchanged in the plural:Survey data of the languages of the lnanwatan district

and kinship nouns where possessive prefixes were found for 1 SG, 1 PL and 2SG forms (27) but
personal pronouns in the other forms (28):

demonstratives, adjectives and verbs and the system works along the same lines. Again, front
vowels are associated with masculine and non-front vowels with feminine gender:
(29)Einogo?a/dau?a nasi-omo.house this.F/that.F good-F
This/that house is good.
(30)Rabfni dcii?anasi-to.that.M good-M
man
That man is good.
(3 1 )Rawodciu?anasi-omo.woman that.F good-F
That woman is attractive.
(32)Mo-(3a-mai.come-FUT-3SG.M
He will come.
(33)Mo-(3a-mao.come-FUT-3SG.F
She will come.
Whereas in Kokoda and I nanwatan gender has a semantic basis in animate nouns only (male
versus female referents), in Puragi (as in Tehit, Flassy 1 99 1 ) the vowel opposition front
versus non-front is used in animate nouns to distinguish male from female referents (30/3 1 )
and in (at least some) inanimate nouns to distinguish small from big referents, (34/35):1 42Appendix 3(34 )amepuri
amepurowind
strong wind(35)beqani
beqanostone
big stoneNouns distinguish number, with the plural expressed by lui replacing the stem final vowel
of the singular. A number of nouns have irregular plurals:
(36)eino
einu murohouse
many houses(37)raga
rago
rorogamale dog
female dog
dogs(38)rah[ni moq6nada
rawo moqanado
rabin u arweone man
one woman
many people2.5.3 VerbsPuragi verbs consist of a verb stem followed by a tense or mood marker and a personl
number(/gender) slot. The Past marker is -ra with - da after i-stems (cf. Kokoda and
I nanwatan cognate Past markers with their a llophones). Gender (M/F) is expressed in 3 SG
forms. The person-number markers of Past and Present are the same.

"Noun phrases seem to have the following general structure:
+/- possessor N/PRO + N(-dem enclitic) +/- NUM +/- ADJ +/- DEM
A noun phrase combining a numeral and an adjective did not occur in the texts but only in the
data elicited through Malay (see below, numerals). I have no examples of noun phrases with
a numeral, plus an adjective plus a demonstrative nor of noun phrases with a possessor plus a
numeral and/or adjective. Gender plays an important role in the cohesion of the noun phrase.
The adjective, numeral and the demonstrative agree with the head noun in gender and number
(see Chapter 3 ).",[77]
