There are one or two tag que s t ions which e i ther do not occur in TT or
whi ch seem to have a dif fe rent meaning . One such tag is wayana? (waya ' now' +
-ana Q? ) , whi c h Godfrey says occurs in TT as meaning 'Do you now understand ? ' .
I t may have this meaning in some o f the ins tances in the MT data , but often i t
j us t seems to b e used much as the t a g que s t i on i s u s e d in English , to evoke a
res ponse to a statement or to seek con f i rma t i o n .

' ( He ' s ) like me , isn ' t he ? ' ( refer ring to pic ture of a boy)( PW4 )Ano the r type of t ag question is derived f rom Eng l i sh , though only one word
i s f rom Eng l i s h .
It is formed by the English loan 0 'or ' and the Tiwi negative
kalu (wu ) , giving ' o r no t ? ' .

i n the clause in T T and the o r d e r is rel a tively f re e . The unmarked orde r i s
S P O whe re 0 refers t o e i the r the d i r e ct or se condary obj e c t ( see the d i scussion
in Osbo rne 1 9 7 4 : 62 f ) . Var i a t i ons from this order are due to d i s course
considerat ions , a full d i scussion of which i s outside the scope of this work .
In gene ra l , the ordering can be looked at in te rms of ' theme ' meaning roughly
' the thing be ing talked about ' , as sugge sted by Osbo rne ( 1 9 7 4 : 62 ) . Osbo rne
says that the ' t heme always comes f i r s t in a sentence , regard l e s s of i ts292
synt a c t i c func t ion' ( 62 ) . Thi s , in gene ra l , would s e e m to b e true b u t the
s i tuation i s a l i t tle more complex than this statement imp l ie s . Of ten when a
topic is being int roduced for the f i r s t t ime it occurs in the theme pos i t ion ,
as in example 6- 1 0 1 though normally new informa t i on is not ini t i a l in the
clause or sentence . 4 7
Example( 6- 1 0 1 )( TT )(ngintiwatingilipangirrangurlimayani ) , apiwe : would : walk : in : mo rning : when : a s leepPipiyanyumili awungajiwel l P .the rengintipamukurughani
we : would : make : camp' (We would walk in the morning when everyone else was a s leep ) then at
Pipiyanyumi l i , there we would make camp . '
New info rmat ion norma l l y occurs fina l l y , o r near final l y , in the clause
and this new info rmat ion can then become the theme of the next clause . 48

VERBAL CONSTRU C T I O N S4. 1INTRODUCTION
There are two type s of verbal construct ions in TT :( i ) an independent inflected verb form , composed of a nucleus and at l e a s t
one or two pre f i xe s , marking subj ect person and tense or mood . 1 The nucleus 2
s t ructure con s i s t s of an obligat ory verb stem, which carries the basic verbal
meaning , optionally preceded by one or two incorporated forms giving add i t ional
nomina l , ve rba l , s ta t ive o r qua l i t a t ive meanings . There may a l s o be o the r
a f f ixe s marking such things as obj ect person , mood , aspe c t , emphas i s , and
location , ( see 4 . 2 and Table 4 . 3 , p . 1 5 2 ) .
Examplea( 4- 1 )( TT )- mpi - n u - wati - ma - jirrakirningi - m�r�ngarrashe - NP - LOC- morn -wi th- l ight
- sit
' She ( the sun ) is s i t ting ove r there with a light i n the morning . '
( i i ) a Verbal Complex ( o r periphras t i c ve rb ) consist ing of a free f o rm
verb which is bas i ca l l y uninf lected , 3 fol lowed by an inf lected auxiliary verb ,
which may carry the same inflect ions as the independent inflected ve rb . The re
are only three main auxil ia ry verb stems ( see 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 , p . 2 1 0 ) .
Example( TT )( 4- 2 )apapi- mpi - n u- wati - ma- jirrakirningi - mi- do
DIR - morn - wi th - l ight
come : out she - NP
' She i s coming out ove r the re in the morning with a l i ght . '
-The choice of ve rbal cons t ruc t i on i s lexically governe d . The class of TT
f ree verb forms i s rela tively sma l l ( only about 40 wo rds in my corpus ) .
Osbo rne cal l s these 'verbal nouns ' . Howeve r , in general , the se forms occur
only in this type of constructi on , though of ten without an auxi l iary verb in
spontaneous speech . 4 Thi s class of f ree verb forms i s extended by the use of a
sma l l numb e r of English loan verbs in TT or LTT (Less Tradi t ional Tiwi ) .
Example( 4- 3 )piraya( TT )langi - mpi - ripu- warla- REP we - NP - them ( I O ) - spi r i t pray
'We j us t pray for the dead . '147mido148
I t i s i n the verbal s t ructures that the greatest change can b e seen i n
Tiwi , and this change i s bound u p with changes in the syntax ( see Chapter 6 ) .
The complexity of the ve rb has been lost in the speech of young people , though
some aff ixes and common stems are retained in MT ( o r perhaps the LTT s tyle of
young people ) . The se cond type of verbal cons t ructi on is the normal type in
MT , wi th the class of f ree form ve rbs be ing extended by a large number of
Eng l i sh loan verbs and also by the use of some common TT singular impe rative
forms as free verb forms ( see example 4-4 ( a ) , and also 4 . 3 . 1 . 2 , p . 20S ) . As
with the independent inf lected verb forms retained in MT , the auxi l iary has
a l s o l o s t the complexi ty of the TT forms .

' they fough t 'I n Chi ldren ' s Tiwi , and a l s o in casual MT , f ree verb forms are used
without inf lected TT-de rived auxiliaries . S Olde r people also use this s ty le of
speech with chi ldre n . Before exces s ive influence f rom English there was
probably a baby talk Tiwi with the s ingular impe rat ive forms used as free form
verbs ( as they s t i l l are with some more common verbs ) . Howeve r , these days
baby talk Tiwi also contains many loan verbs . 6 Some young children ( of about 6
or 7 years ) , howeve r , know and are able to produce some forms of the aux i l i ary
and even some forms o f the independent inflected ve rb . The range of language
known and produced by chi ldren can be seen by the range of responses given for
s e t s o f pictures used to elicit vocabulary and expre ss ions f rom them .
Some
verbal forms were e l i c i ted by using a series of pictures of people (males ,
fema l e s and groups of people ) performing various actions . The varie ty of
responses given for two of these i tems are shown in Tables 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 . The
responses are ar ranged roughly in orde r , from those closest to the TT f o rms to
those c l o s e r t o English forms . These two tables represent the types of
re sponses for each i tem. The ages of the chi ldren tested ranged from 3 or 4
years (not many ) to 1 6 yea rs . The f igures in the columns represent the numbe r
of chil d ren giving that par t i cular response a t each of the three s e t t l ement s ,
Pularumpi ( Pi ) , Nguiu ( Ng ) and Mil ikapi t i (Mi ) . The age range of the chi ldren
g iving each res ponse is noted in parenthe s e s for each i tem. For ins tance , f rom
Table 4 . 1 , f our children f rom 1 2 years to 14 years gave the TT form
�pirimajirripi for ' she is s leeping/ lying down ' .
The t e s t i s classed a s formal e l i ci ta t i on because the response s we re
e l i c i ted in a fo rmal si tua tion (normally at schoo l ) .
I have found that in
spontaneous speech even fewe r forms approxima t ing TT forms are used , with
children using more English loan verbs for f ree verb forms ( normally without an
auxi l i a r y ) than in formally e l i c ited mate ria l . From the tables i t can be seen
that the maj o r i t y o f children gave the forms with a free form ve rb , an Eng l i sh
loan verb in mos t cases . 7149

yati has been re analysed as ' seven' ( s ix plus one ) and kiringarra yirrara a s

The form walimani i s obviously derived f rom the shape of the wri t ten

is a feminine form of punyipunyi 'brain' and I would as sume it is de r i ved from

Whi l e many young people seem to know t h e T T numeral s , or rather s ome
vari e t i e s of the TT or LTT forms , the forms for the numbers four to ten are
rarely used in the i r speech , except perhaps in a formal s i tua tion. Young

thi s may not be gene ra l .

1 1 . The s i tuati on described by Douglas ( 1 968 ) for the south-we s t of Aus tral ia ,
regarding Nyungar , Neo-Nyungar and We tj ala could be thought to be simi l a r .
Howeve r , the Ne o-Nyungar he describes is more l ike the Tiwi-Eng l i sh code
than Modern Tiwi . A si tuation similar to this may develop among the Tiwi
if Modern Tiwi is replaced by Tiwi-Eng l i s h .
( This i s d iscussed f urther in

1 2 . I am not sure about Mil ikapi t i . There may be some Tiwi there who are
monol i ngual in Eng l i s h . Howeve r , if so , they are l ikely to be b i lingual in

PHONOLOGY2.1INTll.ODUCTIONIn considering the total range of the verbal repertoire of the Tiwi speech
commun i t y i t i s d i f f i cu l t to def ine an overall sound system . At the two ends
of the continuum are the sound systems of trad i t i onal Tiwi and Eng l i s h .
Through the range be tween the two extreme s there is a complex intermingling of
the se two systems , producing in some cases new phonemes or new allophonic
In genera l , a greater inf l uence is exerted by TT . Tiwis who s peak
variat ions .
a version of English close to standard English s t i l l usua l l y have an ' accent ' ,
par t i cularly in the i r vowel qua l i t y and the i r product ion of some Eng l i s h
consonant clusters . O n the other hand , T T is inf luenced very l i t t l e , if at
a l l , by Engl ish phono logy .
TT is like other Aus t ralian languages in mos t aspe c t s of i t s phonology .
In common with typical Aus t ralian languages it has the following consonantal
feature s and point s o f articulat ion : lack of cont ra s t be tween voi ced and
voi c e l e s s stops ; and bi labia l , lamino-dental , apico-alveolar , lamino-pa l a ta l ,
It has a
apico-doma l , and velar stops and nasals ( Dixon and Blake 1 97 9 : 1 9- 20 ) .
s ingle laminal series with lamino-dental and lamino-pa l a t a l stops being
a l l ophones o f the one phoneme , and with the nasals fol lowing the same p a t t e rn .
There are two rho t i c s and two la terals and the semi-vowel s , w and y .
In
genera l , Austral ian languages lack f r i ca t ives but a few in the north-we s t have
a velar f r i ca t ive ; e . g . Iwa i d j a and Maung ( Ca pe l l 1 9 6 2 : 1 2 9 ) .
Tiwi is another
of the s e langua ges . As in other Aus t ral ian languages there are onl y a few
contrast ive vowe l s ( f our ) .
The incorporat ion of new sounds from Eng l i sh is large ly dependent on age
and educa t i o n . Older people , par t i cularly those for whom TT is the no rm , when
using loans in Tiwi usually use a ' Tiwii sed ' version such as Ip i � i p i � i I for
' f i s h ' or � u ku l i I for ' schoo l ' , even though they may use a more angl i c i sed
pronunc iat i on when speaking Engl i sh . On the o ther hand younger speakers wi l l
o f ten u s e an ang l i cised version , such as If f s l ( or perhaps Ip i s / ) and
Is ku l ( i ) I , in the i r s t yle of Tiwi . The version chosen by young people of ten
seems to depend upon the forma l i t y of the speech or the age of the addr e s see .
The forms with Tiwi phonology seem to be used more in the stories given and the
e l i c i ted data or when speaking to older people , and the more Eng l i s h forms in
spontaneous speech with the ir peers .
Whi l e new sounds from Eng l i sh. are coming into the Tiwi language some
sound s f rom TT are tending to drop out , such a s the apico-domal ( po s t-alveolar
or re troflex) consonants and the velar fricative , others may be changed in some
way . The se changes are d i scussed in more d e t a i l in 2 . 3 , p . 3 3 .","[25, 26, 27]"
"The( i i i ) Sentences with verbs of 'want ing ' or 'knowing' e t c .
Again i t i s only the older young people who use the subo rdinate
conj unc t ion ngini , and the re are only about ten examples in the data , mainly

of unc e r tainty about what is being said , such as following a clause meaning : ' I

"2.4.1PHORKnC REALISATIOR OF ENGLISH PHOHKMKS IR KTSome of the phoneme s of TT and English ove rlap , although the realisation
of the corres ponding phonemes may not be exactly the same . However , there are
also a number of phoneme s which do no t correspond . In borrowing words f rom
Engl ish , older people gene rally f i t them into the TT phonological sys tem , even
though they may pronounce the words wi th their English phonemes ( or close
approximations to them) when speaking English . Non-Tiwi sounds are changed
into the closest Tiwi sound . Fricatives become s tops , such a s : f , v become p ;
s , z , s , � , t � and d � become I � I ( [ i] o r [ � ] depending usually upon the
phonological environment ) ; the vowel glide s [E L] , [a L ] and the vowel [aJ ] (when
it is lengthened before a voiced consonan t ) become lay i I ( [£ i ] , or [£ L ] ) .
Als o , since consonant clus ters cannot occur in TT , CC clus ters f rom
English loan words have a high vowel inserted ( I i I or lu i depending upon the
phonological environment) or lose one of the consonant s .
Since consonants do
not end words in TT , a high vowel , I i i , is added to consonant-final English
loans o r in some cases the f inal consonant i s droppe d .

English pronunciation , part icularly in more inf ormal s tyles of Tiwi , such as in
casual speech . Modern Tiwi contains a large number of English loans , verbs as
we l l as nouns . The se vary widely in p ronunciation ; the more formal the s tyle
of Tiwi used , the closer the form is to tradit ional phonology. For ins t ance ,
in the formal vocabulary t e s ts , for the word ' f ight' (eli ci ted by showing a
picture of two boys fi ghting ) , mos t children gave / pay i t i / [ pe tt i ] . Howeve r ,
in the tapes of spontaneous speech the anglici sed ve rsion [ f a L t ] occurred more
often , even in a basically MT sentence . Tables 2 . 3 and 2 . 4 give the English
phoneme s and the i r realisat ions in the Tiwi of young people . The real isations
and the examples given come f rom a wide spread of young people . No one
individual would realise each phoneme in all the ways given. Mos t of the
real isations given occur in the English of the young people as well , though
normally the real isations which are closer to TT phonology do not occur in the
English s tyles .
Thi s phenomenon (of newer loans having a phonology closer to the source
language ) has been noted in othe r language contact s i tuations , particularly
whe re the re is a proce s s of language death occurring . This is noted in Sayula
Populuca ( Clark 1 9 7 7 ) and Is thmus Nahuat ( Law 1 9 6 1 ) .
As can be seen from Tables 2 . 3 and 2 . 4 there are a large number of phones
added to the repe rtoire of the young people 's speech . Because of the
instab i l i t y over the whole range of speech patte rns , it is difficult to

"3 . 3. 2 . 1KKPHArIC nOXOURSIn TT , the sp pronouns are formed by the add i t i on of one of the suf f i xe s ,-ila or -awa ( bo t h of which are used el sewhere , see 3 . 6 , p . 1 38 ) , or in one casea combination of both . With the add i t ion of the suf f i xe s there are some
changes to the s t e m , mos t of which can be exp lained , such as a regular
morphophonemic change involving the dropping of the f inal stem vowel preced ing
a vowel ini t ia l suffix ( see 2 . 8 , p . 7 1 , and Osbo rne 1 9 7 4 : 2 2 ) .
Example( 3-55 )nginjayou ( sg )+( TT )-ilaEMPH--) nginjilayou ( s g ) : EMPHTable 3 . 7 gives a compari son of the normal and empha tic personal pronouns .
The choice of suffix may be seen to be phonologically determined in mo s t case s ,
the suffix -awa occur ring when the f inal consonant of the s tem i s an alveolar ,
and the suf f i x -ila occurring when the f inal consonant of the stem is any other
consonant . Another explana t ion is that the suffix -awa occurs for thi rd person
and -ila for othe r persons . 38105

func t i on to the English fo rms ' mysel f ' , 'yoursel f ' , e t c . ( 1 9 7 4 : 55 ) . This i s
true to a c e r t a i n extent b u t the i r semantic range is rathe r dif fe rent f r o m the
Engl i s h empha t i c pronouns . Godf rey says that wi th the use of the se the re i s
o f ten conveyed the sense o f ' power ' , particularly with the third person minimal
f orms ; for instance , ngatawa mapurtiti i s o f ten used to mean ' t he powe rful
s p i ri t ' , meaning ' Satan ' .
She sugge s t s that ori ginally the re we re two s e t s of
emphatic pronouns , one with the suffix -awa , poss ibly with the meaning of
' powe r ' or ' impo rtance ' and the other with the suffix -ila , with the sense o f
'exc lus i on of others ' . The se two sets have ama�gamated i n t o the one set but
the two meanings are re taine d , some t ime s with one meaning in f ocus and
some t i mes with the othe r . I n some cases the meanings seem t o b e re l a ted .
Thi s
seems a f e a s i ble sugge s t ion because , although the form wutila does not occur
a lone a s an empha t i c pronoun for third person augmented , i t does o ccur as the
base for othe r pronouns bui l t on the emphatic pronoun , such as the ref lexive ,
wutilamiya , ' themselve s ' ( see 3 . 3 . 2 . 4 ) . Some examples of the use of the se
pronouns are given below and the two senses d i s cussed above can be seen in some
of the m , whi l e in o the rs the i r use seems to be for emphas i s onl y .

in S e c t ion 3 . 6 , p . 1 38 , on c l i t i c s in general .
These pronouns are of ten used with a prepo s i t ion , kangi or ka . 4 1
God frey
says that a regular language he l pe r ( a man of about 50) some times wrote kangi
as in kangi ngatawa ( prep + he : EMPH ) but tha t recently he has wri t ten
kangatawa , which is how younge r people say i t . I t seems then that kangi has106
become ka before a n ini t i al ng ( cf . 2 . 3 . 1 0 , p . 4 5 ) . 42 Such a cons t ruct ion i s
u s e d as a locative , often w i t h the emphat i c pronoun used in a possessive sense
( on its own or with a noun meaning 'house ' or 'home ' ) .
In the se l a t t e r cases
it seems to mean 'one ' s own home or camp ' , which has the sense of 'exclusion ' .
Example
(a)( TT )( 3- 5 7 )yinipakupawurlikangatawa(japuj a )to : hi s : EMPH home
he : came : back
'He came back to his ( own ) home . '
(b)yimuwukanginyi tawahe r : EMPH
PREP
he : sa t
'He sat with her ( in her own camp ? ) . 'In the speech of the young people i t is only in this type of con s t ruction
whe re I have found the empha tic pronouns of TT , though the prepo s i t i on i s
always ka and never kangi . Thi s prepo s i t ion i s a l s o used w i t h normal personal
pronouns , but there is so l i t tle data containing e i ther of these cons truct ions
that i t i s no t clear whe the r there i s a seman t i c d i s t inction in the i r use .
The re appears to be no example where ka plus a normal pronoun means ' t o
someone ' s place ' , unle s s it precedes a possessed noun meaning 'home ' ( as in
Examp le 3-58d ) .
In gene ra l , i t seems that the re may be a d i s t inction be tween
ka plus a normal pronoun and ka plus an emphat i c pronoun , with the forme r one
meaning ' t o / a t someone ' ( a s in Example 3-58a ) and the l a t t e r meaning ' to / a t
someone ' s place ' ( as i n Example 3-58b ) , though perhaps t h i s second one can a l s o
mean ' to / a t someone ' , with a n empha tic sense ( as in Example 3-58c ) .
In a l l cases the construct ion se ems to be rega rded as a single word , s ince

-MT is characterised mainly by the exclus i ve use of a free form verb , which
may be pre ceded by loan aspect word s , and whi ch , in the more formal s tyles of
MT ( as in e l i c i t e d spe ech or in recorded stories ) , is followed by a TT-de r i ved
aux i l i a r y . The LTT s t y l e s a r e characte rised b y the u s e of Tiwi ve rb s t ems and
verbal inf lect ions , though there may be less of these than in TT or they may be
changed in s ome way . These LTT s tyles have not been s tudied in d e t a i l and s o
the f e a t u r e s noted for LTT ( in Table 1 . 1 ) a r e mainly impre ss ionis t i c .
CT , typically spoken by children under 7 or 8 years , is a developmental
s t age of MT and so differs from chi ld to chi l d , though there are some common
features ( see Table 1 . 1 ) . I t i s mainly characteri sed by the non-use of a
TT-derived MT auxiliary or by the non-s tandard use of one ( see 4 . 3 . 1 . 2 , p . 205 ) .
The s tyle I am call ing Casual MT i s s imi lar to CT , in that a TT-derived
auxil i ary is normally no t used and the past tense word , pin , 15 may be used , as
In both these vari e t ie s the re is a rigid SVO word o rd e r .
Casual MT
in CT .
d i f f e r s f rom CT in that the phonology may be closer to TT phono logy ( unle s s i t
i s being u s e d a s a 'baby talk ' ) and in the complexity o f sentence s t ruc ture
( i . e . a gre a t e r use of relative and other subord inate clauses , see 6 . 9 , p . 295 ) .
Casual MT could be a later his torical devel opment than the more formal
style o f MT , which doe s have a TT-de r ived auxi l i a r y , perhaps replacing the more
f ormal style . However , there is no clear evidence that thi s is indeed
happening .
Table 1 . 1 gives a summary of the various var i e t i e s in the Tiwi verbal
repe r t o i r e . The Tiwi-English column combines features from the whole range of
Tiwi-Eng l i s h ( i . e . from styles close to Pidgin Engl ish to styles closer to
SAE ) .
The ve rbal repe r t o i re of the Tiwi community could be regarded as a
continuum ( as d i scussed by Bicke rton , 1 9 7 5 ) , par t i cularly for the Eng l i sh end
of the spe c t rum . There seems to be no clear boundary between the uppe r limi t s
o f T E and the lower limi t s of Standard Aus tral i an English ( or Colloquial
Aus t ra l i an Engli sh ) .
Ind ividua ls in the Tiwi community command a range ( or ranges ) of the
verbal repertoire and , as ment ioned previous l y , mos t are bil ingual in at l e a s t
one code of Tiwi and at least one of Eng l i s h . V e r y f e w people under 30-35 have
a good command of TT but mos t older people have a command of MT , which t hey
normally use in address ing young pe ople . Ve ry few people have a good command
of S t andard or Colloquial Aus tral ian Engl i s h , though mos t people ' s
unde r s t anding i s be t t e r than the i r production.
Some people , par ticularly young
people ( teenagers and those in the i r twent i e s ) have a reasonable unders tanding
o f the S tandard Aus t ra l i an (or even American ) Engl ish used in f i lms and TV . 16
Throughout the history of the mission at Nguiu the teaching of Standard English
in the scho o l s has been stressed and Pidgin Engl ish ( PE ) was not ' pe rmi t t e d , . 1 7
Howeve r , there i s a considerable amount o f PE spoken , though normally among
themse lves or with othe r Abo rigines , not usually with Europeans . 1 8 I a m not
sure of the relati onship be tween thi s PE and that spoken elsewhere in the17

d i s t ingui shing i t f rom TE (at l e a s t one s tyle of TE ) . The Tiwi s i tua t i on

l i t t le Pidgin Eng l i s h at Milingimbi ( Elwell 1 9 7 9 : 96ff ) .
The language s i tuation of the Tiwi speech community i s further comp l i cated
by the amount of code-switching which occurs . At time s i t i s d i f f i cult to
d e t e rmine whe re code-swi tching is a c tua lly occur ring because of the amount of
code-mixing there is in MT , pa r t i cularly in Casual MT , in which Eng l i s h loans
of ten have a pronunci a t ion the same as or simi l a r to the i r pronunciation in

"6.3.3. 1CLAUSES WITH VDBS OF SPEECH IB TrIn TT . the speech complement may be a phrase with the prepo s i t i on ngini .
with the meaning 'about ( something ) ' ( see 5 . 2 . 4 . p . 24 2 ) . The speech complement
may a l s o be manifes ted by a speech complement clause ( Sp Co C l ) or a quote
clause (Q Cl ) . The s e last two are d i s t inguished in that the speech complement
clause refers to what is said and means 'about when

5 . 2 . 4 . p . 24 2 . and 6 . 9 . 7 . 1 . p . 304 ) . The quote clause also opt i onally begins

Still others may be

used in MT , except for the verb s tem �i ' s ay ' , and the free verb nimarra
' ta lk ' . Mos t of the speech verbs in MT are Eng l i sh loan verbs .
Some verbs take a speech complement , which may cons i s t of a spe e ch
complement phrase ( Sp Co Ph) or a quote clause ( Q Cl ) . There a re only two
examples of a speech complement clause occurring . Each of the se complements

nega t i ve pronouns . The l a t t e r two sets are built upon the interrogatives ,
whi ch in turn are bui l t upon the stem kuwa - for humans and kami - for
non-humans .
In TT , the human forms are marked for gender or numbe r , whi le the

dete rmine a unif orm phonemic system f o r MT . The idea o f each word having i t s
own range of sounds , discussed i n 2 . 3 , p . 3 3 can be extended to the loan words
used by young people . The word for 'frightened ' can be represented as :
[ p( L )RAt fn ( i ) l , whe re P can be [ p l or [ f l , R can be [ r l or [ r l ( see 2 . 3 . 8 ) , A
The variations at either extreme are : [ p L rat C n i l
can be [ a l ( o r [ A l ) or [ a L l .
(close to T T ) and [ f ra L t L n l ( close to English) wi th various forms in between.
The re are some re s t rict ions on the cooccurrence of various phone s , in that ,
when the more English phones are used the re is generally no high vowel added
between the consonant s of a consonant clus t e r or at the end of a word .
Normally , though not always , the more English vowel sounds do not cooccur with
the more Tiwi consonants , though for ins tance the variant [ p ra L t L n 1 has been
3
heard . These observations seem to apply to loan words in gene ral . 8
Diffe rent people organise the phones into diffe rent phonemic sys tems ,
which will be discussed in more de tail in Sect ion 2 . 5 in summaris ing the

2.4IRFLDKHCK OF ENGLISH OR MODERN TIWI PHOROLOGYThe influence of English upon the Tiwi sound sys tem is similar to the
inf luence of English on Creole , de scribed by Sandefu r . As he points out , when
English f i r s t came into contact with Abor iginal language s , English words
borrowed ' were pronounced by Aboriginal speakers in terms of the sound systems
of the i r own' language ( Sandefur 1 97 9 : 2 9 f f ) . As t ime went on Creole ( o r
pidgin at thi s stage ) was influenced i n turn b y Engl ish , but thi s inf luence has
been in s tage s , result ing in a continuum of sounds . He says that the ' AL
[ Aboriginal Language s ] sounds that had replaced the English sound s in the
f orma t ive s tages of Creole began to return to or level toward the original
English sound s . ' ( Sandefur 1 97 9 : 42 )
This levell ing process i s apparent in the Tiwi situa t ion . Although the
language spoken by the young people cannot be regarded as an Engli sh-based
creole ( or pidg in) , it is certainly more heavily influenced by English than
tha t of the older people . Some young people ' s Tiwi is more influenced by
English than that of other young people . The situat ion port rayed in thi s
section shows a wid e range of data , collected f rom a large number of
individuals and theref ore much variation and f luctuat ion i s apparent . If only
one individual had been considered there would not be such dive r s i ty as

TT , being highly polysynthe t i c , i s a complex language by any s t andard .
Not only can the inf lected verb have a large number of af f i xes ind i ca t ing a
number of gramma t i cal relat ions and a number of incorporated forms conveying
various semantic not ions , these affixes and forms have a number of
morphophonemi c variations depending upon the morphemes preceding or fol lowing
them. As Clark and Clark ( 1 9 7 7 : 33 8 ) say :
Although formal complexity i s not yet very we l l def ined ,
roughly speaking a sys tem wi thin a language i s formally
more complex when i t contains rules with excepti ons . 53
In thi s sense , TT i s a language with complex morpholog y .
That the re a r e dif fe rences i n fo rmal complexity between languages ( a t
l e a s t in some aspe c t s ) can b e shown b y comparing noun plurals in Engl i sh and
Egypt ian Arab i c . Clark and Clark ( 1 9 7 9 ) say :
Egyptian Arab i c , in cont ras t [ to Eng l i sh ] , uses many more
devi ces for expressing plural i ty
and i s corre spondingly
ha rde r for children to maste r . Both Arabi c and English
child ren start to expres s - the idea of ""more than one "" at
much the same age , but the gap between the f i r s t expression
of plurali ty. and mas tery of the adul t devices i s much
greater in the case of chi ldren acqui r ing Arabic .
In
gene ra l , the mo re complex the lingui s t i c devi ce to be
acqui red , the greater this gap should be ( S lobin 1 9 7 3 ) .
• • •Ano the r examp le o f complexity of language a f f e c t i ng language acqui s i t ion
is given by Slob in ( 1 9 7 3 : 1 8 1 ) who says that for b i l ingual chi ld ren acqui ring
two language s , ' i f a given semantic domain receives expre s s i on e a r l i e r in one
of the two language s , a diffe rence in formal complexity is sugge s ted ' . He
gives some examples of s tudies of b i l ingual children in which this i s
ind i cated .
One such study i s that o f child ren becoming b i l ingual in
Se rbo-Croa tian and Hungarian. By the age of two , children we re using a vari e ty
of Hungarian case end ings on nouns express ing a number of loca t i ve re l a t i ons
but a t the same t ime they had barely begun to devel op locative expre s s ions in
Serbo-Croa ti an , which requi re a locative prepo s i ti on as we l l as a case ending
on the noun ( 1 9 7 3 : 1 8 2 ) .
Slobin ( 1 9 7 7 : 1 9 0 ) says further that systems which maintain the princ i p le
of seman t i c clarity are easier to acqui re . The Turkish sys tem of agglutina tive
mQrphology has almo s t pe rfect one-to-one corre spondence of f orm and meaning and
the entire system i s mastered wel l be fore the age of two
[ On the o ther hand the Serbo-Croat ian inf l e c t i onal

[ In learning Se rbo-Croatian ] the child chooses a single

In e f fect , he has made his Indo-European language as

"4.3VERBAL COMPLEXESThe ve rbal complex cons i s t s of a free verb form carrying the bas i c verbal
meaning and an auxi liary , which may be inflected in the same way as the
independent inf lected ve rb .
In TT , this con s t ruct ion i s not as common as the
independent ve r b . Howeve r , it is typical of more formal MT , with t he

Somet imes
the meaning o f the verb is d i f f e rent f rom i t s Engl ish meaning ; for example ,

' s le ep ' , payiti ' f i ght ' , kirayi 'cry ' , tapi/sapi 'know' ( f rom ' savvy , ) . 72
The se older loans are also used by older people in the i r l e s s trad i t i onal

creo l e s , such as Kriol ( S andefur 1 9 7 9 : 1 1 4 ) , Cape York Creole ( Crowley and
Rigsby 1 9 7 9 : 1 8 8 ) and New Guinea Pidgin or Tok Pisin (MUhlhHusler 1 9 74 : 55 ) ,

case it behave s l ike a t rans i t ive verb ( but without the -im ) or by ' l ook ' , in
which case i t behaves like an int rans i t i ve verb .

young chi ldren hear older people using to them.
In speaking to children , adu l t s a l so often use the impe rative form of a
verb as a free form ve rb , with or without an auxil i a r y .

( i i ) The complex inf lections of the TT verb have been greatly reduced
( no rma l ly with compensat ion el sewhere see Chapte r 6 and cf . Table 4 . 3 , p . 1 52 ,

4.2.2.2, p. 176).

"354Some cre o l i s t s hold this view, that a language i s created anew by each
gene r a t i on , as being par t i cularly evident in the forma ti on of creole s .
Bicker ton ( 1 9 7 5 : 6 ) says tha t 'creoles are , qui te l i terall y , invented or
re invented each t ime they appear ' . He cl aims ( 1 9 7 7 : 64 ) that a pidg i n , by i t s
very na ture , i s inadequate a s a model f o r chi ld ren t o use a s a primary language
be ing ' too impove ri shed and uns table a medium to se rve all the communicat ive
ne eds of an ind ividual . '
Chi ldren must then draw upon the i r innate knowledge to expand the language
to enable it to function adequat e l y .
S lobin ( 1 9 7 7 ) looks a t the cognit ive and communi cat ive dete rminants of the
nature of language and how the se apply in relat i on to language change ,
comparing the change apparent in language acqui s i t i on , historical change and
change in contact s i tua tions . He presents four basic 'ground rule s ' to which a
communicative system must adhere i f it is to func t ion as a 'full-f ledged human
language ' ( S lobin 1 9 7 7 : 1 8 6 ) . These f our ' charge s ' are :
( i ) Be clear ( s ta ted previously as one of Slobin's ope rating principles of
chi ld language : 'Underlying semantic relations should be marked ove r t l y and
clearly' ( Slobin 1 9 7 3 » .
( i i ) Be humanly proce s sible in ongoing time , meaning that ' language must
conform to s t rategie s of speech percept ion and production' ( Slobin 1 9 7 7 : 1 86 ) .
( ii i ) Be quick and easy , relating to the human propens i ty to ' cut corne r s
( 197 7 : 187 ) .
( iv ) Be expres s ive , in�luding two important aspect s : seman t i c and
rhe t orical . A fully expres sive language needs to be able to encode a wide
range of seman t i c no t i ons and must also be able to be used for more than j us t
conveying l ogical propo s i t i ons and referential informat ion.
It needs t o
provide speakers w i t h means of engaging a he are r ' s attention , of conveying
speci f i c a t t i tude s , of expressing social relat i onships e t c .
S lobin sees the se four principles a s i n conf l i c t , the f i r s t two tending t o
s impl i f y language and the latter two tending to e laborate and expand i t .
Pidgin languages and early chi ld languages are seen a s being inf l uenced mo s t by
the f i r s t two principles and creo l e s and adult language ( or older chi ld
language ) need to at tend more to the last two charge s .
Whi l e Slobin's the ory is not fully deve loped ( a t the time when the study
for thi s present work was done ) and there may be some problems in it ( s ee
Sankoff 1 9 7 7b and S chles inge r 1 9 7 7 ) , it does seem to go a long way in
explaining the nature of language change and the relat ionships between language
change and language acqui s i tion.
It exp lains the s imi larity in s t ructure and
func tion between the Tiwi and Eng l i s h spoken by young children and pidgin
language s ( i . e . very l i t t l e inf l e c t i on and with the inf lect i on which i s present
being regularised or generalised , s t r i c t SVO orde r , l i t t le marking of tense or
aspect , coordinate rather than subordinate structure s ) 6 1 and between the MT
spoken by older children and young adu l t s and creole languages ( wi th more
inflec tion , marking o f tense and aspect and more use of subordinate
s t ructure s ) .
S ince Slobin ' s principles app ly to chi ld and adult language in gene ral
(not just in a contact s i t uation) in relation to pidgins and creoles , they do
not explain other simi l a r i t i e s ( such as lexical ) between MT ( and TE ) and the
northern Aus t ra lian creoles ( see note 58 ) . Nor do they explain the d i f fe rence355
between the MT spoken by adu l t s (young and old ) and the i r LTT s tyles . The re
appear to be add i t i onal reasons concerning the language acqui s i t ion his t o r i e s
of M T speake r s . The acqui s i t ion hi s t o r i e s of the Tiwi young people appear t o
b e different from those of the semi-speakers of Eas t Sutherland Gae l i c .
The semi-speake r s of E SG had various Gae l i c acqui s i t i on histori e s .
Dori an says ( 1 9 8 1 a : 1 4 8 ) :As[ Some ] were fluent child-speakers , dominant in Gae l i c , at
the time they entered schoo l .
[ Some ] also had
childhood pro f iciency great e r than the i r current
proficiency , but they we re neve r completely fluent and
neve r Gae l i c-dominant ;
others learned more active
ski l l s as they grew old e r , through having an interest in
the language .
• • •The se semi-speaker s had the i r primary socialisat i on in Eng l i sh or Engl ish
be came the i r primary language after entering school . 62
In the Tiwi s i tua t i o n , it i s my be l i e f that mos t of the young people ,
whose f i r s t language is MT , have never had the i r primary socialisat ion in TT ,
so tha t by the time they entered school they were not fluent TT speake r s .
By
the same token the primary socialisation has no t been in Eng l i s h either ( though
nowadays chi ldren are addre ssed in both Tiwi and Eng l i sh , see Table 8 . 1 ,
p . 33 6 ) .
As I have mentioned el sewhe re , the se days adults and olde r children tend
to speak to young children in a 'baby talk' ve r s i on of Tiwi ( BT ) ( as we ll as a
simple vers ion of TE ) . Thi s BT is basically a casual MT ( i . e . with no
TT-derived i nf l e c ted verbs or auxi l i a r ie s ) but with s ome phonological
d i f f e rences { su ch as /y/ for / r / and api co-alveolars for retrof lex
consonants ) . 6 3 The use of baby talk seems to be a common feature in Aus t ral ian
Abo riginal languages ( see Chapter 7 , note 1 , p . 3 2 3 ) as i t is in languages all
ove r the world ( Brown 1 9 7 7 : 20 ; Ferguson 1 9 7 7 ) . 64
It seems highly probable ( because of the complexi ty of the TT mo rphology )
that even before contact the re exi s ted a BT style .
One feature of this whi ch
seems t o have survived into the present BT , and hence into MT ( in addit ion to
the phonological d i f f e rence s ) , is the use of the singular impe rative as a free
form verb ( see 7 . 3 , p . 3 1 8 , and 4 . 3 . 1 . 2 , p . 20 5 ) . There mus t have been a point in
time when adults started us ing more Eng l i sh loans , including verbs , in the i r
BT .
It is not clear if this occur red because older children were already
speaking a ve r s i on o f Tiwi which contained a greater number of ve rbal complexes
( compared to inf lected independent ve rbs ) and using English loan ve rbs as the
f ree form verbs in these ve rbal complexe s , due to the gradual bre akdown and
re lexif i c a t i on of the language .
Thi s may have been the case . Howeve r , there is ano ther possible
explanat ion which seems to correlate with the age div i s ion be tween MT and LTT
speakers . During the t ime of Father Gse l l ( 1 9 1 1 - 1 9 3 8 ) communi cation with the
olde r people was in Pidgin English ( see 8 . 2 . 1 , p . 3 2 7 ) . Father McGrath , who
took over from Father Gse l l , apparently had a very good command of Tiwi and
the re was l i t t l e need for the older people to speak F.ngli s h , 65 though it was
s t i l l t aught to the child ren in school . When Father McGrath l e f t in 1 948 ,356the re would probably have been a break in communication with the older people .
I t is my be l i e f tha t , rathe r than reve rt ing to us ing a form of pidgin Eng l i s h 66
in which t o communicate to the older people , the remaining staff ( only a few) ,
in emulat ing Father McGrath , spoke Tiwi to them.
( Most mi ss ion staff have
a lways se emed to pick up and use s ome Tiwi , mainly common words ) . Howeve r ,
because of the lack of con t rol of the language by mos t of them this would have
been a very much reduced form , with perhaps the use of Engli sh verbs rather
than the complex Tiwi one s . I n turn , the older Tiwi may have used a ' f ore igner
talk' Tiwi to the mis si on staff , again with some Engl ish verbs . Thi s may have
come to form the basis of a BT form , which adu l t s may have begun using with
chi ldren , possibly to make the i r entry into school easier or perhaps j us t to
make i t e a s i e r to communicate with the children who had been inf luenced by
Eng l i s h . The ' f o r e i gner talk' Tiwi may have been based upon a pre-exi s t ing BT
form.
However the BT developed , i t seems to me that an angl i c i sed BT is the
'pidgin' or simplif ied hybrid upon which MT has been bui l t and expanded .
Fe rguson and de Bose ( 1 9 7 7 ) point out the simi l a r i t i e s between ' s i mpl i f ied '
regi s t e r s ( such as broken language , fo re igne r talk and baby talk) and pidgins .
MUhlhHus ler ( 1 980 : 48 ) says that simp l i f i ed registers of this type
appear to be mos t influential r ight a t the beginning of t he
pidgin-creole life-cycle
[ but ]
l i t t le is known
about the i r role s
in the form of 'mothere se ' , in the
gradual trans i ti on from a second to a f i r s t language .
• • •• • •• • •In the Tiwi s i tuation thi s BT has not developed into a s table pidgin .
However as MUhlhHusler ( 1 98D : 32 ) points out :
Creol i zat i on seems to be able to take place at any s t age o f
a developmental continuum .
Fur the r Bicke r ton ( 1 9 7 7 : 5 7 ) says :
[ The ] period at which this step takes place will be
decide d , not by any inte rnal deve lopment in the pidgin , but
by the communicational needs of chi ldren .
Although the role of baby talk in a chi l d ' s language acqui s i t ion is not
clearly unde rs t ood as yet ,
the s t ructure of the input is proving more and more to be a
crucial factor
in the sense of utte rances d i re cted at
the chi l d .
( Traugot t 1 9 7 7 : 83 ) 67
• • •Nobody deve lops a language in a vacuum, so to this
knowledge [ i . e . innate knowledge di scussed by Bicke r ton ] 68
we must add chi ldre n ' s refe rence to perceptual s t rategies
that analyze the input provided both by the pidgin , however
inadequate , and the nat ive languages heard though not
ne cessarily wel l unders tood by the chi ld .
( Traugot t
1977 : 8 7 )
I t would seem then , that the basis o f young Tiwi children ' s speech has
been an angl i c i sed BT . Trad i t iona l l y , chi ldren would probably have been
expected t o stop us ing CT by a certain age , possibly five or s i x , as is the357
present c a s e w i t h Anindi lyakwa ( Leeding 1 9 7 7 ) . Howeve r , w i t h the introduc t i on
of an ang l i c i sed BT thi s expe c t a ti on may have been waived and children were
perhaps not correc ted . Olde r children also we re possibly addressed in an
anglici sed Tiwi and they in turn add ressed younger chi ldren in angl ici sed BT .
Al though MT cannot be regarded as a creole in the s t r i c t e s t sense of the
term, it does appe ar to be a creolised form of an angli cised BT . BT is not the
f i r s t language of anyone but it i s in a sense a 'contac t ' l anguage ( cf . Giv6n
1979 : 5 ) .
In the development of MT , children ( and adult s to a ce rtain extent )
have drawn upon Tiwi , Engl i sh and Pidgin Eng l i sh to produce a hybrid or
amalgam.
An expanded form of this ang l i cised BT i s also used by older adul t s as a
se cond ' language ' 69 in speaking to olde r children and young adul t s ( see Table
8 . 1 , p . 33 6 ) . Although I have not s tudied the d i f f e rences be tween the MT spoken
as a f i r s t l anguage by young people and that spoken as a se cond ' l anguage ' by
olde r adul t s , there do appe ar to be d i f f e rence s . 70 The phono logy of the MT of
older adul t s is closer to TT phonology ( the Eng l i sh loans a re normally more
Tiwiised as wel l ) . Olde r adul t s use more TT inf lect ions in the auxil i a r y ve rb
(when they use one ) and do not normally use the aspect words tra ' t ry ' or sat
' s t a r t ' , though they do use pin 'pas t ' in the i r casual MT ( see no te 58 , p . 364 ) .
I am not sure when adu l t s started to speak to chi ldren in s imple TE in
add i t ion to BT .
I t i s pos s ibly a fairly recent step . However , even before
that , children we re coming into contact with Engl ish , at least when they
reached school and possibly even earlier .
As has been pointed out before , Chi ldren ' s Tiwi and the i r Tiwi-Engl i sh
converge ( 1 . 7 , p . l l ) . From studies done by Vol terra and Taes chner ( 1 9 7 7 : 3 1 1 ) ,
i t seems that children who grow up learning two languages go through three
stage s :
( i ) the chi ld has one lexical system which includes words f rom both
languages .
( i i ) the chi ld d i s tingui shes two dif ferent lexicons but app l i e s the same
synt a c t i c rule s .
( ii i ) the child has two l ingui s t i c codes dif f e rentiated both in lexi con
and syntax , but each language is exclusive ly associa ted with the pe rson using
that language .
With Tiwi children the second s tage seems to last conside rably longer
( un t i l about six or seven years old ) than in a s table b i l i ngual s i tuat i o n .
Thi s i s po s s i bly because the same person speaks b o t h languages to the chi ld .
However , Tiwi chi l d ren do seem to eventually develop and sort out the i r Eng l i s h
and the i r Tiwi . A s children grow o l d e r they deve lop a more formal MT s tyle
which more closely app roaches TT than the i r casual style does ( i . e . with the
use of inf lected TT-derived auxi l iaries , the use of more TT-derived words and
Tiwiised Engl ish loans , 7 1 and with a syntax more like TT ) . They also develop a
s tyle of Eng l i s h which i s closer to SAE and which they use with Europeans ,
whi l e retaining a more casual s tyle of TE which they use in code-swi t ching in
the i r speech with the i r pee r s ( see 8 . 2 . 2 . 3 , p . 344 ) .","[361, 362, 363, 364, 365]"
