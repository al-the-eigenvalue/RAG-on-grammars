2.1. Polar questions
2.1.1. Ordinary polar questions
The ordinary polar question (yes-no question) is not marked morphologically; the interrogative meaning is expressed only by a ris-ing intonation contour (Krejnovich 1982:150). A question can have
the form of an affirmative (815) or negative (816) clause:

2.1.2. Alternative questions and the disjunctive/interrogative particle du
Disjunction in alternative questions is expressed by a clause-final
particle du, which is repeated after each of the disjoined alternatives:476Chapter13.","[494, 495, 496]"
"Narrow focusand grammaticalFocusIf the answer to a question-word question like (796) is constructed
as implied by the question, that is, if it answers exactly that question, without any reformulation of its presuppositions, the constituent that “replaces” the question word is also marked as Focus.",[480]

Similarly, the Interrogative forms are used only in the context of anon-Focus question word (277). General (yes/no) questions allow
only the Indicative forms (278a); the Indicative form is also an
option in specific questions(278b).",[163]

5.2. Indirect questions
Indirect questions can be either identical in form to direct
question-word questions (5.2.1) or contain a nominal form of theverb instead of the Interrogative (finite) form (5.2.2).
Basically, the indirect question serves as a reporting element
(complement) with speech act verbs and verbs of cognition; in
this case, it renders the “theme” of the reported speech or thought(5.2.1-5.2.2). This syntactic pattern is also compatible with verbs
implying finding an answer to some question (5.2.1). In addition, this strategy can be applied to create correlative subordinateclauses (5.3), although this use appears to be rather marginal.
0.2.1. Finite indirect questions
Finite indirect questions are identical in form to direct questionword questions; they are used as a complementation strategy withspeech act verbs (880), with verbs and expressions of cognition506Chapter13.","[525, 526]"

"Roughly, these are clauseswhich can serve as appropriate answers to questions like ‘What

belong to any coherent chain of actions (Krejnovich 1982:214).",[484]

A participant and the O participant of the action being questioned
are specified or implied (839), the latter, if only one participant
is specified, independently of its role in the situation being questioned, i.e., such a question can mean both ‘What did/will X do?’(840) and ‘What happened/will happen to X?’ (841).",[504]

described in 2.8.
1.1.3. Polarity1.1.3.1. Negative forms.",[164]
"Correlative subordinate clausesThe indirect question construction can be used to create adverbial(5.3) and relative (5.3.2) clauses. In this case, the question word
serves as the subordinator, with a demonstrative pro-form of the
ta-series serving as the correlate in the main clause. This pattern
constitute a marginal alternative to subordination by means of
verb morphology (see Chapter 11) and appears to be due to the
Russian influence.

This case is fully grammaticalized: the Focus marking is mandatory whenever a question word occurs in the S/O position, ie.,
not only in question-word questions, but also in dependent clauses
made up as questions (where the interrogative pronoun functions
as a sort of relative pronoun,see 19.5.3), and in exclamatory sen-tences with question words (see3.3.1.1).",[479]
"Question-word questions2.2.1. Questioning constituents of the main clause
Any constituent of the clause can be questioned (see 7.1.3 for interrogative pro-forms used for such questions}. The linear positionQuestions481of the question word is rather flexible; it can occur either in theposition most typical for the constituent type (831b), (832b) or besentence-initial; see (830b), (831a).°%
The verb normally takes the Interrogative form (see 6.1.1.1);
however,the Indicative mainformsare also possible;see, e.g.,(828b), (835a), with the exception of first-person forms which can
be only Interrogative. Questions to the S/O constituent obligatorily involve Focus marking, including the Focus-indicating verb
form. The following examples illustrate question-word questionsto other types of constituents.%

2.2.3. Questioning constituents of the noun phrase
Anynounmodifier can be questioned.","[504, 505]"
"91The Predicative caseThe Predicative noun phrase is the nominal predicate (163) or the
Focus of a clause (Krejnovich 1982: 184; 232ff}. Only S (164)
and O (165) can acquire the Predicative marking (9.1.1.2; cf. also
Note 18). The Predicative case is incompatible with Possessive
noun phrases, proper names, and third person pronouns, whichtake the Nominative case in these functions {see (158)-(160)).

The Predicative marker has two variants, -lek and-(e)k, which are
formally distinguished only with vowel-final stems and in the Plural form (see Table 10, 1.4.1). There is a clear functional distinction between these variants which subsumes two interrelatedfactors:7°
First, the short. variant is used if the narrow information focus(e.g., the focus of contrast) falls on a modifier, rather than on the
noun phrase as awhole:(166)a. kukkivosemnadcat’cuckoo eighteen

‘Then she went and found traces of otherpeople.’ (F54]
The relevance of this factor is indirectly shown by the fact that
only the short variant is possible in question-word questions witha question word modifying a noun (cf. £2.3.1.1):

"Compulsory Focus markingThere are a few easily identifiable environments which always trigger Focus marking, that is, discourse or clause-internal contexts
in which Focus marking is compulsory. This class comprises environments where the situation being described is taken to constitute the presupposed or implied information (i.e., the finite verb
belongs to the pragmatic presupposition of the clause; see 3.1.1-3.1.2) and the contexts of explicit contrast associated with the
S/O constituent (3.1.3).
Note that these environments are defined for both S/O constituents as a whole and for modifiers within such NPs, i.e., the
Focus-marking system generally does not distinguish between theSemantics of grammatical Focus459Focus on the whole constituent and on one of its subconstituents
(see, however, 5.4.1.3, for the effect of this distinction on the choiceof the Predicative marker on NP).
3.1.1. Question words
If the 8/O constituent is represented by an interrogative pronoun
or contains a question word, it has to be marked as the Focus(796).","[478, 479]"
"To be moreprecise, these verbs require some speech-reporting expression to
be present, and this expression may but need not be represented
by an NP marked as the direct object. Thus, these verbs maytake an ordinary NP (9.2.6.2) or a regular nominal complement
(11.1.3.3)} as the reporting element.
This section deals with syntactic strategies which are used pri-marily for reporting speech, quotations (5.1) and indirect questions
(5.2). These strategies can also be applied, although infrequently,
for other types of clause-linkage (5.1.3, 5.3).
5.1.",[520]
"Chapter13Sentence types and negationThis chapter deals with grammatical manifestation of illocutionarydistinctions (Sections 1-3) and negation (Section 4). Yukaghir
distinguishes Declarative sentences (which are not discussed as
such), Imperative sentences (Section 1), polar (2.1) and questionword questions (2.2), and two minor types: Exclamations (3.1)
and Optative sentences (3.2).
The verb forms used in major sentence types are described in
6.1.1; this chapter is concerned with syntactic properties associated with distinct types, in particular, their characteristic particles(2.1.2, 2.1.3, 3.2).
Section 5 describes the syntactic strategies of reporting the contents of a speech act, including the attested peripheral uses of these
strategies.
1. ImperativesentencesThe imperative sentence type is distinguished by means of verb
morphology, that is, by use of the Imperative verb forms (see
6.1.1). Therefore, this sentence type is described and exemplified
in 6.2.8; this section contains only some marginal notes.
In order to propose a common action (i.e., instead of the 1PL
Imperative), the main (Indicative) 1PL form can be used, with or,
less frequently, without the Future marker (see also 6.2.3).","[492, 493]"

This environment can be subsumed under a broader category of
“narrow focus” clauses, i.e., clauses in which the S/O constituent or
one of its subconstituents is the only element of the assertion, the
remainder of the clause being presupposed and/or implied. This
environment obligatorily triggers the Focus packaging variant:(798)a. el+jubege-nide

"Verb morphologyone hand, neither the Imperative nor the Interrogative forms canenter the grammatical Focus construction. On the other hand,
with respect to the Focus semantics (see 12.3), the Imperative
forms are similar to the Main forms, inasmuch as both can serve
as the single element within the scope of the illocutive operator
(narrow focus}. This property is manifested by the capability ofbeing the only overt element of a main clause:

This is impossible for the Focus-indicating and Interrogative
forms. The SF forms and the OF forms are used only in the
nominal Focus constructions (Krejnovich 1982:204-216), that. is,
they constitute a finite clause only in combination with a noun
phrase in the Predicative form.”

Finally, the Action Nominals are used to build relative clauses,
i.e., the Action Nominal can modify a noun.",[170]
"Correlative relative clausesCorrelative relative clauses are madeup as finite indirect ques-tions, with the demonstrative pronoun tamun ‘that’ (889a)-(889b)
or a full NP (890) serving as the correlate in the main clause; in one
instance, the correlate in the main clause is the universal quantifier(889c),
This pattern can be used for the same types of relativization asthe Attributive relative clauses (12.3.1): for relativization of the
subject (889a), of the direct object (889b)-(889c), of the Possessor
(890a), of the temporal (890b) and spatial (890c) adverbial. The
spatial relative clause (890c) can combine a question word with the
Result Nominal form (cf. the similar effect in correlative adverbial
clauses constructed according to the same pattern).",[530]

Since I began to study Yukaghir in 1985, so many people have
helped me in various ways or influenced my thinking about language in general and about Yukaghir in particular that expressing
my gratitude in full length would constitute a book in itself.
First and foremost, I am indebted to my informants: Vasiliy
Shalugin, Akulina Shadrina, Lyubov’ Dyomina, Ivan Dolganov,
Vasiliy Spiridonov, Maria Turpanova, and Elizaveta Dolganova.
Without their generous help, interest and patience, this book
would never have come to be. I owe the most for my knowledge of
Yukaghir to Vasiliy Shalugin, with his fascinating talent and intuition, and his constant readiness to tell stories in Yukaghir and
answer all possible questions in the most revealing and insightful
way.
Iam grateful to the linguists who helped me take my first steps
in linguistics: Juri Maslov, Nikolay Vakhtin, Alexander Volodin,
Evgueni Golovko, Vladimir Nedyalkov, Maria Polynski, Vladimir
Plungyan, and Yakov Testelec. Their readiness to comment on
my drafts and to discuss mysteries of the Yukaghir grammar cannot. be overestimated.
[I am particularly grateful to my friend
and colleague Nikolay Vakhtin, who has spent many hours and
weeks teaching me what descriptive linguistics and field research
is all about. I would also like to express my gratitude to Leon
Stassen and Frederik Kortlandt for feedback on an early draft. of
this grammar and for their encouragement at the time when it was
most needed.
My field research was made possible by the financial support
of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Soros Foundation.","[6, 7, 8, 9]"

The second type of information structure is likely to occur if the
(transitive) event as a whole is opposed to some background information. A characteristic environment is the context of a con-ditional construction (803), where the main clause as a whole is
opposed to the conditional setting (roughly, it can be conceived
of as an answer to a question like ‘What will happen if...’). In
this situation, the most significant information-structuring bound-Semantics of grammatical Focus467ary lies between the conditional clause and the main clause, rather

"2.3.2. Clause chaining
Kolyma Yukaghir makes extensive use of clause chaining, where
non-finite verb forms marked for switch reference (converbs) are
used for all clauses except the final one:(10)a. tatgonu-tjud-de-geomnt[CA go-SS:IPFV][see-3SG-Ds][people alléumuinzu-lel-niasleep-INFR-3PL:INTR|

The range of functions covered by the converbs in Kolyma Yukaghir is extremely broad. Clause chaining is the main strategy
for describing a sequence of temporally adjacent or related events,
as well as for conditional and concessive constructions. This construction is also regularly used to describe the situation of perception, where the situation being perceived is expressed as the finiteclause (cf. (10a)}. Another noteworthy application of converbs is
for aspect-like internal structuring of a single event, as in (9c) and
(10d).
2.3.3. Relativization and complementation
Relative clauses are built by means of the Attributive verb forms,
the Action Nominal, and, far less frequently, by the Result Nominal. The syntactic roles accessible for relativization are the subject(11a), the direct object (11b), the spatial or temporal adverbial
(11c), aud the Possessor of the intransitive subject (11d).

3. Aboutthis grammar8.1. Purpose
The history of Yukaghir studies features the names of two brilHant researchers, Woldemar Jochelson and Eruhim Krejnovich,
who have provided the basic grammatical descriptions of the Yukaghir languages (Jochelson 1898; 1900; 1905; Krejnovich 1955;
1958; 1968; 1979; 1982). The Kolyma Yukaghir language has beenbriefly described by Jochelson (1905) and Krejnovich (1979); the
former source(which is apparentlybest knownto the English-reading audience) is based on the rich data collected by Jochelson
at the end of the XIX“ century (1898; 1900}. Krejnovich’s essay in Encyclopedia of the languages of Asia and Africa (1979)
is based both on Jochelson’s materials and on Krejnovich’s ownAbout this grammer13data collected in 1959. Finally, Krejnovich’s last work (1982) represents the most detailed and comprehensive source of information
on arange of significant issues for both Yukaghir languages. These
works constitute the major sources of first-hand data on Kolyma
Yukaghir,’ which have served as the basis for a number of papers
dealing with some specific topics, as well as for typological studiesinvolving Yukaghir data. A detailed description of Kolyma Yukaghir phonology based on new field data constitutes a part of Irina
Nikolaeva’s unpublished Ph.D. thesis (1988b).
Thus, there is no book which might serve as a reference grammar of Kolyma Yukaghir. Further, some important aspects of thelanguage have not been described at all. This grammar is intended
to fill that gap, drawing both on the previous descriptions of Yukaghir and on the results of my own field work, and thus to make
Kolyma Yukaghir data available for further studies, as well as for
cross-linguistic research.”
The grarmmar attempts to cover all attested forms and constructions of contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir; in this restricted
sense, it is intended to be comprehensive. It is clear, however,
that no single book can provide a truly “comprehensive” description of any human language, at least not at the present stage ofdevelopment of linguistics. Writing a grammar inevitably involves
making a number of choices, so that some aspects of the language
structure may be described and exemplified in more detail, others
only briefly sketched, and possibly some may be omitted from the
description. Insofar as such decisions have been made consciously,
I have attempted to write this grammar in such a way as to “let
the language speak”, rather than to force it to answer any particular theoretically pre-determined questions. In other words, I

distinctions that, appear to be of importance in Yukaghir grammar and discourse, rather than on those that play a major role in
current linguistic theories.","[30, 31, 32, 33]"
"VerbsVerbs fall into two major classes, transitive and intransitive. Each
class has two series of Indicative finite forms, for main clauseswhich are neutral with respect to grammatical Focus (Main forms)
and for clauses with intransitive subject (S) or direct object (O}
marked for grammatical Focus (SF and OF forms, respectively).
The finite verb agrees in person/number with the subject (the OF
paradigm and especially the SF paradigm are less distinctive than
the Main one). The Imperative is expressed by a distinct seriesof forms, which are shared by transitive and intransitive verbs.
Illustrative paradigms are given in Table 3 (for the verbs modo-‘sit, stay’ and a- ‘makc’).
There are Interrogative forms which are used only in questionword questions in which the questioned constituent is not S/O (in
the latter case, the respective Focus-indicating forms are used).
For the first person subject, there arc special Interrogative person
markers, -m 18G, -ok IPL. The second and third person Interrogative forms differ from the Main Indicative forms only in absence ofthe (in)transitivity morphs -j/e)- / -m(e)- (e.g., (qodo) a-k ‘(how)
you (8G) made’, (godo) a-met ‘(how) you (PL) made’, (godo) a
‘(how) he made’, (godo) a-ni ‘(how) they made’).
The verb morphology is clearly aspect-dominated; the regularly
marked aspect. meanings are Imperfective, Ingressive, Resultative,
and Habitual:6(2)Chapter i. IntroductionProductive Aspect markers:

d-l-o-j ‘it is made’‘he used to make’The only obligatorily marked tense distinction is Future vs. NonFuture (the suffix -te-~-t- for Future, zero marking for Non-Future), although the Past may be expressed through periphrastic
verb forms. The Periphrastic Past is built by putting the Subject

There are four regular valence-changing means, the Reciprocal
(pre-verb n’e+), the Reflexive (pre-verb met--), the Causative (suffixes -S-, -§-€il’e-), and the Resultative (-off)-), and a number of
nonproductive valence-changing suffixes.","[25, 26, 27]"

‘The bad old shaman ran away.’[F44]Besides being deficient with respect to the converb formation,
qualitative verbs have a number of derivational peculiarities; in
other words, they constitute a morphologically distinguishablesubclass of verbs (see 6.3.5.3, 6.3.6.3, 6.3.6.4, 6.4.3.3.2).@Yettheir major inflectional categories, as well as the verb-like Attributive marking, prevent them from making up an autonomous classof “adjectives”.'°
3.8, Adverbial use of qualitative verbs
A remarkable peculiarity of qualitative verbs is their adverbial use,
which seems to be directly related to the absence of converbs intheir inflectional paradigm. First, a number of qualitative verbs
derive adverbs by means of the suffix -n:
(119)éugo->ugo-n‘be quick’
omo‘be good’>‘quick, quicker’
omo-n
‘entirely, very much’Gero->6éeru-n‘be quiet, slow’
éomo‘be big, great’>‘slowly, quietly’
€emo-n
‘very much’azo->azo-n‘be early’‘early’Cf. the following examples:
(120)a. pon
itazo-l’el
early-INFR(3SG)‘It was early.’70Chapter 4. Parts of speech and inflectional paradigmsb. irk-id’e
one-ITER—-ugujel-meazo-nmorning-TMPearly-ADVTMEZZE-CEawake-PFV:INTR:1SG
‘Once I got. up early in the morning.’ [K2]
Furthermore, some qualitative verbs can be used adverbially, i.e.,
to modify predicates or attributes, in the short Attributive formin -j~-s’ (see 3.3.3):
(121)a. tetgnmeomo-s’ad-tmoj-kyourmindgood-ATTRfirm-ATTRhold-IMP:3sG‘Stand firmly by your ideas.’ [F22]
b. gristostamunjola-tlebie-leomo-s’Christthatafter-ABLearth-INSTRgood-ATTRjug-m
see-TR:3SG‘Since then, Christ could see the earth well.’ [F9]
c. tetyoueri-s’mit joulus’-olmon-te-jekbad-ATTR[wesay-FUT-INTR:28Gask-RNR]“You have answered our question badly(--wrongly).’ [F31]
Such a construction is absolutely impossible for ordinary verbs
(which can be used adverbially only in one of the Converb forms,see 6.1.4).
5.4. Nonverbal qualitative stems
There are two pairs of qualitative stems which do not fit into the
classification outlined above. A first pair comprises the stems juku-‘small’ and éom(o)- ‘big’. In some frozen collocations, these stems
can be used attributively without any marking.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"‘What woman would it be?’ [F49]
Secondly, the formal opposition in question is employed to express
the distinction between the true predicative and the referential use
of noun phrases. The Predicative noun phrase in -iek ascribes aproperty to (i.e., classifies) some entity.In other words, an example
like (165) might be appropriately rendered as ‘The thing I will
give to you is a fox’. The variant in -ek signifies the referential use
(i.e., the Focus NP introduces a referential entity); this is shown
by the fact that only this variant can be used if the noun phrase
is modified by a numeral, in particular by the numeral irkin ‘one’:(168)a. tat
