In Alutor argument reflexivization (affecting the argument position) is expressed with
the help of the reflexive pronoun uvik ‘oneself’ (lit. ‘body’), and possessive
reflexivization (affecting the possessive position) uses the pronoun sininkin/sinin
‘one's own’ (the second variant is used in case of incorporation).
The question of control of reflexivization is of special interest. According to the
field report by F.A.Antsiferov (1978), the A/S-argument is the controller of
reflexivization:

of the P-argument ‘nose’ its possessor is raised into the opened P-position. In (65c) Sargument controls reflexivization of the dative argument.
Possessive reflexivization allows the A- and P-controllers:

"114Cf. the English pronoun what used attributively in phrases like what book?.
Actually, there exists an interrogative pronoun derived from the root {taq} by means of
the suffix -in(a), that is the pronoun {taq.in(a)}. However, it is used only to denote the object of
certain verbs of speech such as ‘say, speak (about smth.)’ in an interrogative sentence, cf. taq.in
ynN.ina iv-la-t? ‘What did they say?’ [10:48]
115109CHAPTER 3. Syntax
In this chapter we shall briefly, without any ambitions to completeness, consider
some of the most important topics of clause structure.
3.0. Basic notions
In this study of Alutor syntax we do not use such t r a d i t i o n a l syntactic notions as
subject and object since, in our opinion, their common usage is not congruent with
the internal structure of Alutor and would merely lead to misunderstanding. In this
case it is more advisable to use more neutral notions based on a framework of core
arguments constituting the base of clause syntactic structure (for the grounds of the
opposition “core vs. peripheral arguments” see [Kibrik 1998]).
There is a restricted number of core arguments in a clause. If there is only one
core argument in a clause 116 , the clause (as well as its predicate) is i n t r a n s i t i v e .
This argument is called the S - a r g u m e n t (Sole) irrespective of its semantic role. If
there are two core arguments in a clause, the clause (as well as its predicate) is
t r a n s i t i v e . A transitive clause has an agent-like A - a r g u m e n t (Agentive) and a
patient-like P- a r g u m e n t (Patientive).
In our case, this terminology is preferable because it does not ascribe a
particular syntactic pattern to Alutor clause structure, keeping this fundamental
question open for further investigation, as there is not yet enough data to resolve this
problem.
3.1. Transitivity increase and decrease
Alutor has a strict distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs. T r a n s i t i v e
verbs have two core arguments: an A-argument and a P-argument. The A-argument is
116In Alutor there are many ambient verbs with a zero S-argument indicating ‘environment
of the event’:

"76Probably it is enough. I will begin to prepare, {because there is our former sister.} I
wish I could attack her and subject her to an excruciating death. [20:54]In these contexts conjunctive has the following components of the meaning:
— the speaker wishes event P to be performed,
— the speaker has resources to accomplish event P,
— the speaker does not have a strong intention to use his resources for the
accomplishment of event P.
Forms in the 1pl actor conjunctive are translated as “If we could do P”:

this matter [=this life] together (with him)? [19:11]In this case the wish component of the meaning is forgrounded. Sometimes the
conjunctive means the availability of potential resources to accomplish event P:

And until now there they always sing a song about this, as if the bear were talking...
[9:42]The meaning of the conjunctive in a dialogue is naturally combined with a
request for advice (in the form of a question) about forthcoming actions:

Besides the regular auxiliaries, the verb n@al- ‘become’ 90 may also function as90A single example has also been documented with the auxiliary verb awwav- ‘leave’ in the

[22:32]2.1.5. Negative forms
Besides the positive verb forms described above, there are negative forms. Verbal
negation can be expressed by the following means:
(1) combination of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb;
(2) combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative (a-...ka);
(3) combination of the negative particle with the analytical form derived from
the deverbal predicative;
(4) the analytical form, derived from the negative analytical representation
(nuN-...-a/-ta);
(5) circumfixes tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in (the latter is identical to the
caritive adjective (see 2.2.2) marker. It is compatible with the negative particle).
Now we will consider the negative forms in detail.
Type (1) is found only for the desirable moods — optative and conjunctive. In
this case the negative (more precisely, the prohibitive) particle qytymmy 91 is used.(i)tovitgag-awwav-laNvyly-NNy...andat.onceRES-leave-RES+3pl.Sgo.out.on.the.shore-ANLTAnd at once they went out on the shore... [22:28]
It is interesting to note that the negative particle qytymmy is also compatible with nouns,
cf. gymmy wiwnyN ty-t-awwavy-N, qytymmy korfa-N ‘I will arrive at Vyvenka rather than in
Korf’. However in general nouns are more often combined with the negative noun alval@in ‘not
that, another’ rather than with qytymmy, cf. gymnan ty-gita-tky-n qajunJunJu, alval@in
NavysqatpilJ ‘I look at the boy rather than at the girl.’

"Type (2) has two realizations. In combination with the negative particle ally, it
contrasts with the positive forms of the real moods. In combination with the particle
kytvy(l), it represents the prohibitive as a negative correlate of optative/imperative.

deriving the negative correlate of the supine (verbal nominal) (see 2.1.6.2 below). The
prefix part of the circumfix coincides with the root of the verb ‘be lost’ (i.e. not to
exist in the real world), the suffix part coincides with the marker of verbal analytical
representation (see the preceding type). This negative form refers to a situation whose
non-existence is a goal of the action expressed by the main clause (see 2.1.6.2).
Second, a-…-kyl@in circumfix is used for the derivation of the negative form,
and then the negative particle ally is added. In contrast to other forms this type is a
deverbal attributive. There are grounds to interpret this form as a negative correlate of
the deverbal adjective (n-...-qin); see 2.1.2.

2.1.6. Infinite forms
The following are the infinite forms: i n f i n i t i v e , s u p i n e , c o n v e r b s , and
participles.
2.1.6.1. The infinitive is derived from the verb stem by means of the -k/-ki marker
(identical to the locative marker), the allomorph -ki usually being used after stems
with final -N, cf. alu-k ‘pick berries’, tannuN-ki ‘fish’. In accordance with phonetic
rules (see 1.3.4.3), the allomorph -k can be realized as -kki after the stressed syllable,
cf. gyvô-kki ‘get stuck’. Most frequently the infinitive is used in the context of phasal
verbs, however other contexts are also possible (see details below in 2.1.7.5).
2.1.6.2. The supine is derived from the verb stem by means of the marker -nvyN. It is
used in the context of motion verbs as well as of other verbs where the expression of
goal is necessary (see (18a-c)). If the goal of the main action is prevention rather than
accomplishment of an action, the negative correlate of the supine is used (tymNi-...-a/ta) (see 18d).

affixes similar to the spatial cases. Converbs do not have any inflectional categories.","[66, 67]"
"61auxiliary depends on the (in)transitivity of the lexical verb: intransitive verbs are
combined with the auxiliary ‘be’ and transitive verbs with the auxiliary ‘do, have’.
The analytical forms have positive as well as negative polarity. The lexical verb
inside p o s i t i v e a n a l y t i c a l f o r m s has the suffix marker -a/-ta (identical to the
ergative marker). There is also the suffix marker -N, see (9b), identical to the dative
marker. These forms are almost impossible outside of analytical verb forms; therefore
their converbal (see below) interpretation is not desirable 88 . We will refer to them as
the analytical form of the lexical verb 89 (glossed as ANLT).
The following are examples with intransitive verb:

[33:31]
-a/-ta form, according translation, is used here as a converb, however in both cases the
subordinate as well as main verbs are the same: ‘eat’ and ‘wash down’. There is an assumption
that in this case the -a/-ta form is not a free one, but it is a part of idiomatic expression signifying
‘to eat and drink simultaneously’.

possible.

"Thus, we have examined pure and combined agreement markers. Their
distribution testifies to the fact that generally according to the cognitive logic of
Alutor the values of person are not independent from the values of mood and aspect.
On the contrary, they constitute a united semantic space where coordinates of various
person values are at different distances from each other and from various values of
mood and aspect. These spacal relationships of mutual proximity/remoteness have
their iconical (though not yet completely understood) expression in the overt form of
agreement markers.
2.1.1.2.3. Pure non-transparent agreement markers
Now let us consider pure n o n - t r a n s p a r e n t markers, presented in boldface in
Table 3. These markers are specific in the sense that it is difficult to ascribe to them a
single person-number value of an A/P-argument. It is easy to see that these markers
usually simultaneously take account of person-number values of both the A- and Parguments of transitive verbs. To be more precise, these markers are present with the
following combinations of person-number values of A- and P-arguments:
A
P
2nsg 3
3sg 3
3nsg 1/2/3
3sg 2
3sg/2 1nsg
3sg/2 1sgAgreement markers
-tki
-ni
nananaina-What is a motivation of this united expression of A/P-person-number values? In
our description the interpretation of these markers is based on the Deictic Hierarchy
mentioned above (see Figure 1). In this Hierarchy the arguments' person-number
values are ordered in accordance with the principle of m a r k e d n e s s r e v e r s a l
with respect to A/P-positions. Namely, the leftmost member of the Hierarchy51generally harmonizes with the A-role, and the rightmost member with the P-role.
Therefore the A-role is mostly unmarked for the ‘I’-argument, and the P-role for the
‘they’-argument, and vice versa, the A-role is generally marked for the ‘they’argument, and P-role for the ‘I’-argument. With respect to the intermediate positions
of the Deictic Hierarchy, markedness of the A-role increases in the Hierarchy from
left to right, whereas markedness of the P-role increases from right to left. The critical
point of this Hierarchy is the boundary between locutors and non-locutors. It is
normal for locutors to play the A-role 69 , whereas it is normal for non-locutors to play
the P-role. The following person-number combinations of A- and P-roles are
congruent with this tendency 70 :
A
P
I
— you sg/you nsg/him/them
we
— you sg/you nsg/him/them
you sg — him/them
It is easy to see that these combinations of deictic categories trigger the regular
(pure and combined) agreement markers. Deviations from the regular coding are
found in the context of the following person-number A- & P-combinations:
A
you sg —
you nsg —
he
—
they
—P
me/us
me/us /him/them
me/us /you sg/you nsg/him/them
me/us /you sg/you nsg/him/themIt is exactly these combinations that trigger non-transparent agreement markers
(see boldfaced markers in Table 3). However, the various combinations of deictic
values trigger different types of non-transparent markers, thus a more precise
formulation is needed. In general the choice of non-transparent coding depends on the
values of both arguments of the transitive verb, nevertheless the starting point for the
choice is the deictic properties of one of them. In the following cases it is the Aargument:
(a) the most deictically unnatural, i.e. the most marked A-argument (= ‘they’) needs the nontransparent marker (na-);69Moreover, locutor can play the P-role in case when the A-role is also occupied by locutor
outranking the former in the Deictic Hierarchy.

English pronominal constructions are used for the sake of clarity.","[51, 52]"

CHAPTER 3. SyntaxCHAPTER 1. Phonology
In the present phonological sketch we will describe the following two main aspects of
Alutor phonology: the static aspect, that is inventories of units (segments and
suprasegmentals), and the dynamic aspect, that is phonological processes. The static
part deals with the sounds of Alutor − phones and phonemes (1.1), as well as the
syllable and rhythmic patterns (1.2). The dynamic part deals with the phonological
processes of Alutor, which are presented in the form of rewriting rules (1.3).
The approach we use here is similar to that of generative phonology (see also
[Kodzasov, Krivnova 1981]). Two levels of representing Alutor words are
distinguished: the underlying level, that is the level of phonemes (it corresponds to
the morphophonemic level in the Russian traditional phonology) and the surface
level, that is the level of phones, or systematic phonetic level (we omit some minor
details of Alutor pronunciation, irrelevant for the phonetic system). Rewriting rules
apply to the underlying representation of a word, which is a sequence of underlying
representations of the corresponding morphemes. Underlying representations of
Alutor morphemes are given in the Dictionary – see Part III. The application of
rewriting rules results in the surface representation, or the phonetic transcription.
In the present section the underlying representation of Alutor words and
morphemes is given in braces. Phonetic and practical transcriptions of words are
usually not parenthesized, but in some special cases the phonetic transcription is
given in square brackets. The application of rewriting rules is shown in round
brackets. The inventories of the surface and the underlying representations are
identical, that means we use one and the same chart of symbols for writing phones
and phonemes.
1.1. Segments
1.1.1. Vowels
1.1.1.1. Inventory
The vocalic system of Alutor consists of 11 vowels. They are: [i], [I], [u], [U], [e],
[E], [o], [O], [y], [a], [A]. The phonological status of each vowel is discussed further.
The Alutor vowels represent a typical triangle system. They are distinguished
in terms of q u a l i t y and q u a n t i t y . The aspects of quality are: t o n g u e h e i g h t
(high vs. mid vs. low), f r o n t n e s s / b a c k n e s s (front vs. central vs. back) and l i p
r o u n d i n g (rounded vs. unrounded).
The classification of vowels is given below in Table 1. The vowel [y], or schwa,
differs from all the other vowels both in length and in function. It is a supershort
vowel, while all the other vowels are of normal length (short or long – see below).","[1, 2]"

(since consonant clusters do not occur word-finally, a schwa is inserted here − see
1.3.3).
The inflectional ending -n is added to stems ending in either a vowel or a
consonant 104 , cf. gytga-n (< {gytga-n}) ‘late autumn’, nalgy-n (< {nalg-n}) ‘fur
skin’.
The inflectional ending -lNyn is usually used with nouns denoting body parts
(both human and animal's), names of animals, and also with nouns denoting one
object of a pair, cf. vilu-lNyn ‘ear’, masvi-lNyn ‘animal's chest’, Higy-lNyn (< {HiglNyn}) ‘wolf’, lili-lNyn ‘mitten’. After stems ending in a homorganic consonant the
inflectional ending -lNyn appears as -lyNyn (see 1.3.3.3), cf. aNar-lyNyn ‘star’.
The inflectional ending -qal is used only with nouns denoting one object of a
pair, cf. pylak-qal (along with pylaky-lNyn) ‘fur boot’, lili-qal (along with lili-lNyn)
‘mitten’.
The inflectional ending -Na is used with a few nouns that probably belong to
the original Alutor lexicon: ypa-Na ‘soup’, kuka-Na ‘pot’, mami-Na ‘fish drying
shed’, qura-Na ‘reindeer’, rara-Na ‘yurt, house’, ruru-Na ‘bed, sleeping place, titiNa ‘needle’, typa-Na ‘stone hammer’.
Many original and some loan-words form the nominative singular by copying
(= reduplicating) the root morph. Such words belong to different semantic groups, cf.
anu-@an (< {anured}) ‘spring’, wiru-wir (< {wirured}) ‘(kind of) salmon’ (for
reduplication rules see 1.3.1).
The ergative markers -a/-ta are distributed according to the final segment of a
stem: the variant -a is used with stems ending in a consonant or a schwa, while the
variant -ta is used with stems ending in a non-schwa vowel, cf. tyrg-a ‘meat, ERG’,
jIl-a (< {jIly-a}) ‘tongue, ERG’, , but gytka-ta ‘leg, ERG’.
In the locative the inflectional ending -ki is characteristic of stems ending in N
(and sometimes in w), in other cases the ending -k or its phonological variant -kki are
used (the latter − after a stressed vowel), cf. lyqlaN-ki ‘winter, LOC’, rara-k ‘house,
ERG’, mimly-k ‘water, LOC’, but lylô-kki ‘eye, LOC’.
The dative, as well as the lative (the latter can be treated historically as a double
case composed of the locative and dative items), has no variants.
In the prolative the morph -gypyN is used with the stems ending in a single
consonant, while in other cases the morph -jpyN is used. If a stem ends in the vowel 104If a stem ends in a consonant, an epenthetic y is inserted to break up an illicit consonant

mark the length on e and o in practical transcriptions of Alutor words (except in
expressive words) − see 1.3.12.
1.1.1.4. Long and Short i, u, a
There is a phonological opposition of long and short vowels i/I, u/U, a/A in Alutor.
The opposition is considerably restricted by the rules of rhythmic and syllable
structure (see also 1.2). The constraints are:
1) a long vowel may appear only in an open syllable (except in expressive
words);
2) in a stressed open syllable (that is the first or the second syllable of a word) a
non-schwa vowel is always long;
3) in a post-stressed syllable (of a stressed word − see 1.2.2) a non-schwa vowel
is always short.
Long vowels are therefore to be found only in the first or second open syllable,
but since in the open stressed syllable the contrast between originally long and
originally short vowels is neutralized, long and short vowels may only contrast in the
first pre-stressed syllable. That is exactly what we found in Alutor, cf. @itítkyn
‘(s)he/it is’ vs. jIlJítkuk ‘gossip’, @upítkyn ‘(s)he is repelling’ vs. lUvítkyn ‘(s)he is
sucking’, jatítkyn ‘(s)he is coming’ vs. @AsíNti ‘two debts’. The functional
significance of this contrast is not great, because pre-stressed I, U, A occur rather
seldom, and in many words originally long vowels occur in a stressed syllable, where
the opposition is neutralized, cf. @øtyk [I] ‘be’ and jØlyjil ‘tongue’, @ãpyk [U] ‘repel’
and lÃvyk ‘suck’, jôtyk [A] ‘go’ and @ÔsyN ‘debt’ (as one can see, in the practical
transcription we mark the length in stressed syllables only on originally long vowels).
At the same time, it is obvious that the length of these vowels is relevant and should
be marked in the underlying representation of corresponding morphemes. Another
piece of evidence for the vowel length is that after an open syllable with a long vowel
there is always a syllable of the |Cy| type, cf. nypØtyqin ‘old’, HÔlyHal ‘axe’ 6 . In the
underlying representation of such morphemes we write both a long vowel and a |Cy|6Here the schwa does not break up an illicit cluster, because the corresponding cluster may
appear in another word (see 1.2.1). Such examples have reference to another phonological
constraint: a syllable with a long vowel cannot be a closed one. Thus we have nypØtyqin (while
*nypItqin is wrong), HÔlyHal (while *HAl Hal is wrong).","[5, 6]"
"Thus, A- and P-markers of transitive verbs are in complementary distribution
between prefix/suffix slots. The S-markers of intransitive verbs are represented in
both slots, the choice depending on the person value. The S-arguments ‘I’, ‘we’, ‘you
(sg)’ are similar (from the point of view of the slot type and the material form) to the
respective A-arguments of transitive verbs, while ‘you (pl)’, ‘(s)he/it’, ‘they’ are
likened (from the point of view of the slot type) to the respective P-arguments of
transitive verbs 60 . It seems that this person differentiation is not random. It
demonstrates the opposition between speech-act participants (l o c u t o r s ) and
participants that are external to the speech act (n o n - l o c u t o r s ). The boundary
between locutors and non-locutors is inside the 2nd person rather than between 2nd
and 3rd person, as is usually assumed. In Alutor the hearer (‘you (sg)’) is a speech-act
participant, while 2nd person nsg (‘you (pl)’) includes, beside the hearer, other
persons, and this is the reason to interpret this totality as a non-locutor. As shown
below, the agreement paradigm testifies, based on cross-linguistically relevant (see
[Kibrik 1997b) opposition between locutors and non-locutors, to the existence of the
multi-member D e i c t i c H i e r a r c h y in Alutor, see Figure 1.

2.1.1.2.2. Pure and combined transparent agreement markers
Until now we have been discussing the autonomous (p u r e ) agreement markers. In
fact, however, the marker can often depend on the mood and/or the aspect of the verb
form expressing simultaneously person-number and aspect/mood values. Such
markers will be called c o m b i n e d markers. Pure and combined transparent markers
are presented in a generalized form in Tables 5-7. These Tables take into account the
agreement markers of all finite verb forms, including mood and aspect. It turns out
that in general, pure markers belong to the set of suffixal P-markers, see Table 7 (they
show little variation in the context of the aspect/mood values of the verb form). As for
prefixal S/A-markers, they are all combined with mood values, see Table 5, and
59This means of coding the singular is used also for the nominative singular of some nouns,
see 2.3.1.1, as well as for number inflection of adjectives (-qin(a), -kin(a) and others), see 2.2.

number neutralization in this context needs additional explanation.
2. Non-locutor P-markers are identical to S-markers in OPT/CONJ (see Table 6a).
3. The agreement marker -gym ‘1sg.P’, presented in square brackets has restricted usage. It
is used only in the context of the 3nsg A-argument (see below).
4. It should be mentioned that -gym ‘1sg.P’ and -gyt ‘2sg.P’ are closely connected with the
agreement markers of the adjective conjugation (see 2.2). They are enclitic forms of respective
personal pronouns ‘I’ and ‘you (sg)’.","[50, 51]"
"2The phonological status of this segment and its functions are discussed in 1.1.1.2.
Besides quality, we also distinguish vowels in terms of quantity: the non-schwa
vowels can be either short or long 1 . The vowel length is often conditioned by the
position of a vowel in a word, but in some cases there is a phonological opposition
between short and long vowels. The vowel length in Alutor deserves further
discussion: the length contrast of e and o is discussed in 1.1.1.3, the length contrast of
i, u, a is discussed in 1.1.1.4.

"1.3.5. Velar Fricative Sonorization
In certain contexts the velar fricative g changes into the corresponding sonorant − the
glide w. Since the passageway between the articulators becomes broader, we treat this
change as lenition. The process does not take place before g.
The sonorization rules run as follows:
an obstruent velar fricative g changes into the corresponding sonorant w in
syllable-final position (not immediately before g); in word-final position or in a
composite the change is optional, i.e.
(9)a. g ⇒ w / _ |C1 and C1≠g
b. g ⇒ w / _ |# or _ |= (optionally)

mônig ~ môniw ‘sack’, løwliw ~ løglig ‘egg’; but there is no change in møgga ‘who’.
1.3.6. Vowel and Glide Coalescence
In Alutor some diphthong-like combinations of the “vowel + glide j, w, @ ” type do
not occur syllable-finally. They usually blend together to produce the corresponding
vowel (mostly a long one). The vowel a and the schwa are most common in such
combinations.
The coalescence of the vowel a and a glide follows the rules:
37The plural marker {w/wwi} seems to have originally had the same distribution of morphs
as the markers k and t: the morph wwi is likely to appear after a stressed syllable, while w
appears in other positions, cf. pantô-wwi ‘pieces of fur from reindeer's legs’, but pylôk-u (<
pylôk-y-w < {plak-w}) ‘fur boots’; but at present the morph -wwi is used not only after a stressed
syllable, but also after any stem ending in a vowel, cf. tatãla-wwi ‘foxes’; a stem ending in a
consonant may have both -u and-uwwi, cf. myng-ãwwi ~ míng-u ‘hands’.",[26]

always a post-stressed one. In most cases it is the vowel a that undergoes the
transformation, but some roots truncate their final i or u. The process is partly
morphologically defined, because morphemes truncating their final vowels form a
restricted group of the lexicon. In the Dictionary the final vowel of such roots (and
suffixes – see below) is shown in round brackets, cf. tôtul (the root {tatul(a)}) ‘fox’.
Some roots ending in a vowel do not truncate their final vowel, cf. pãnta (the root
{punta}) ‘liver’, @inøri (the root {iniri}) ‘blanket’.
The deletion is also attested for some suffixes, for example, the possessive
suffix {-in(a)} and other adjectival suffixes that historically originated from the
former, such as {-kin(a)}, {-lin(a)}, {-qin(a)}. The deletion of a root-final vowel
may also occur in a composite, so in this respect the vowel deletion is similar to the
consonant deletion.
The rules regulating final vowel deletion run as follows:
if a morpheme is marked for vowel deletion, it loses its final vowel in word-final
position; the deletion may also occur when the morpheme appears as a non-final part
of a composite, i.e.
(3)a. V1 ⇒ ∧ / _# and V1∈ Mvowel deletion
b. V1 ⇒ ∧ / _= and V1∈ Mvowel deletion (not regularly)
Examples: tôtul (< {tatul(a)}) ‘fox’, cf. tatãla-wwi ‘foxes’; @ømyt (< imt <
{imt(i)}) ‘burden’, cf. @imtø-ta ‘by a burden’; @yllôNi (< yllaNj < {yllaNj(u)})
‘younger brother’, cf. @yllôNju-ta ‘by a younger brother’; @aNqôkin (< {aNqakin(a)}) ‘sea, marine (sg)’, cf. @aNqô-kina-wwi ‘sea, marine (pl)’; @asgønHylJu (<
asgin=HylJu < {asgi-in(a)=(t)Hylw}) ‘today’.
1.3.2.3. Hiatus Vowel Deletion
Two vowels may occur adjacently in the underlying representation only at a
morpheme boundary. Since hiatus is impermissible in Alutor, the situation may be
remedied in two different ways:
1) a glottal stop is epenthesized between the vowels (the epenthesis rules are
given in 1.3.3.1) − this usually happens at a composite boundary, for instance,
ra@øtynvyl@yn (< {ra=it-nv-l@-n}) ‘master of the house’;
2) one of two vowels is deleted − this usually happens at an ordinary morpheme26In the section “Morphology” (see Chapter 2) the final vowel deletion is treated as a
morphological means of forming the nominative singular, but in the section “Phonology” we
prefer to describe the vowel deletion as a phonological process.","[18, 19]"

In esirable moods the values of person (-n/-na marker) and number ([syncope of the final -a]
‘sg’, -t ‘du’, -w ‘pl’) are split, see Table 7 and Comment 3 on Table 4. In the bjective moods,
excluding the perfective indicative, the singular (-∅) and non-singular (-t marker) are
differentiated.
6. The perfective indicative, i.e. the most unmarked aspect-mood form, occurs, on the
contrary, in the most peculiar way, in the context of 3rd person S-argument. 3rd person singular
has the marker -j ‘3sg+PF+IND’, identical to the ‘2sg+PF+IND’ marker. However, it is most
remarkable that 3rd person dual (‘they two’) has a unique marker -gy@yt ‘3du+PF+IND’. 3rd
person plural is not combined by aspect values; the marker -t is combined with mood only and is
identical in the indicative and potential irrespective of aspect.
7. The existence of the single locutor suffix -t ‘1pl.S’ marker in imperfective, identical to the
‘3nsg.S’ marker for POT and IND, suggests an idea that ‘we many’ includes third persons in the
set of participants (‘we many’ = ‘I+they’), i.e. plurality iconically marks 3rd person rather than 1st
person. This interpretation being accepted the suffixal locutor S-markers are present only in the
perfective aspect with the exception of the potential mood.
8. After stems with a single final consonant the 3nsg S-marker -na- sometimes has the
allomorph -yna.

Comment:The category m o o d is also obligatory. It has four values:
- i n d i c a t i v e (IND), does not have its own specific markers;
- o p t a t i v e (OPT), does not have its own specific markers 48 ;
- p o t e n t i a l (POT), circumfix marker ta-...(-N) 49 , framing the verb stem;
- c o n j u n c t i v e (CONJ), prefix marker @-/A- 50 .
Besides these, in Alutor there is also an impersonal form of the i m p e r a t i v e
(see 2.1.3).
Finally, the finite verb agrees 51 in person and number with its core arguments,
distinguishing three persons (1st/2nd/3rd person) and three numbers — s i n g u l a r
(sg), d u a l (du) and p l u r a l (pl) 52 . Intransitive verbs agree with their sole core
argument (S - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the nominative, and have, aspect and mood
being fixed, 9 person-number forms. The transitive verb agrees simultaneously with
the agentive argument (A - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the ergative as well as with the
patientive argument (P - a r g u m e n t 53 ) marked with the nominative, and has, aspect
48The mood value is coded cumulatively, together with person-number values, see below.
The suffix component of the circumfix can be covert, for example, in imperfective
potential. The potential marker coincides with desiderative marker (see 2.1.3 below).
50
The marker A- is a phonetic variant of the marker @- in specific positions (see 1.3.6).
51
In Alutor the person-number markers are combined with the unmarked usage of personal
pronouns in the core argument positions, so it is possible to interpret them as agreement markers.
52
As the paradigms show, semantically this tripartite personal opposition has its own
internal structure. The opposition ‘singular — non-singular’ (sg — nsg) consists of six deictic
items. Elementary single entities are defined in terms of speech act participants (1sg = ‘speaker’,
2sg = ‘hearer’) and non-participants of the speech act (3sg = ‘somebody’). Non-singular entities
are totalities of elementary entities: 1nsg = ‘speaker and hearer/somebody’, 2nsg = ‘hearer and
somebody’, 3nsg = ‘somebody and somebody’ (i.e. the countable number opposition of
homogenous entities is present only in the 3rd person). Exactly these entities are ordered in the
Deictic Hierarchy (see Figure 1 below). The arrangement of non-singular entities with respect to
singular entities is semantically motivated. Thus, ‘1nsg’ includes, besides the speaker, the hearer
and/or the 3rd person. Such an entity is lower on the Hierarchy than ‘1sg’. Simultaneously this
entity is higher than ‘2sg’, because it includes the speaker, and this factor is most important for
the Hierarchy. The motivation for ‘2nsg’ is similar.
Within the scope of the non-singular there is a proper number opposition of dual and plural
(du and pl), because the number of homogenous elementary entities increases, and this opposition
uses iconically specific coding devices (see 2.1.1.2.4). Dual does not have a surface expression (it
is possible to postulate the zero marker), and plural is expressed by a specific morpheme —
pluralizer -la.
In that way the prototypical number opposition is represented in the subsystem of 1/2nd
person nsg, and partially in 3rd person sg/nsg.

1.1.2. Consonants
1.1.2.1. Inventory
The Alutor inventory of consonants is not large, it includes only 18 segments. The
consonants are distinguished in terms of p l a c e o f a r t i c u l a t i o n (labials vs.
dentalveolars vs. palatals vs. velars vs. uvulars vs. glottal laryngeals vs. epiglottal
laryngeals), m a n n e r o f a r t i c u l a t i o n (obstruents vs. sonorants; plosives vs.
fricatives vs. vibrants vs. glides; central vs. lateral), n a s a l i t y (oral vs. nasal) and
s e c o n d a r y a r t i c u l a t i o n (non-palatalized vs. palatalized). The classification of
consonants is given below in Table 2.

lJNwq@HjThe status of each consonant will be discussed further. Alutor consonants are
divided into two subsystems − obstruents and sonorants. They differ greatly, so we
would like to consider them separately.
1.1.2.2. Obstruents
The obstruents are subdivided into two classes: plosives and fricatives. In Alutor all
the plosives are voiceless, and all the fricatives are voiced. The Alutor fricatives have
a rather broad passageway, so they are similar to sonorants. Fricatives are represented
by only two segments − v and g. It is remarkable that while Alutor fricative obstruents8are not numerous, there is great variety to the sonorants. 9
Alutor obstruents occur at all the places of articulation, except for the absence
of palatals.
Labials are represented by the two consonants − p and v.
Dentalveolars (both obstruents and sonorants) are represented by the dentals t,
n, l and the alveolar r. The dentals contrast in secondary articulation − palatalization;
they may be either non-palatalized or palatalized. The non-palatalized dental t does
not have a voiced fricative correlate 10 . The exact palatalized correlate of t would be tJ,
but this is not the sound we usually find in Alutor (actually, the sound tJ does occur,
but only in some Alutor words, cf. matka ~ matJka ‘interrogative particle’). The
sound we consider the palatalized correlate of t is represented mainly by two variants,
both close to the palatalized tJ, but not identical with it: the affricate tsJ and the
fricative sJ, the latter similar to a palatal fricative. The affricate occurs mainly in the
speech of the old generation, while the fricative is more widely used, it occurs in the
speech of young and middle-aged people. In papers on Alutor the fricative sound is
usually registered as s; in the present paper we also use s to write this sound in the
practical transcription. It is remarkable that the morphological alternation t/tsJ occurs
approximately in the same contexts as the alternations 1/1J, n/nJ (see 1.3.10). On
these grounds we refer to tsJ as the palatalized correlate of t. The phoneme tsJ has no
voiced counterpart 11 .
Velars are represented by the plosive k and the fricative g. The fricative is
rather close to the sonorants, it often sounds very much like the labial velar w 12 . It is
remarkable that g changes into w syllable-finally (see 1.3.5).
Uvulars are represented by the plosive q, which is slightly pharyngealized. In
9It is possible that the Alutor system is changing from a system with two classes of
obstruents − plosives and fricatives, to a system with one class of plosives. That is just how the
Koryak consonants are often described (see [Trubetskoy 1958, Zhukova 1972]): all non-plosives
are treated as sonorants. But there are some typological facts that should be taken into
consideration: first, two labial non-nasal sounds are not common in the class of sonorants; second,
if g were a sonorant, we would have its vocalic correlate – a high back non-rounded vowel, but
there is no such vowel in the Alutor system. That is why we prefer to describe the Alutor system
as contrasting between plosives and fricatives. Cf. also the reconstruction proposed in [Mudrak
2000].
10
The corresponding phoneme is reconstructed for the Chukchi-Koryak protolanguage
[Muravyova 1986a]: in Alutor it coincided with t, in Koryak − with j/č, in Chukchi − with r, cf.
Alutor tiNak − Koryak jiNek − Chukchi riNek ‘fly’.
11
Even if there had been such a sound in the proto-Alutor language, it is likely to have
coincided with the palatal j.
12
Such a sound exists, for example, in the Polish language.","[7, 8, 9]"

for 1st/2nd person arguments — singular (sg) and non-singular (nsg), are
distinguished, and the opposition of dual and plural is expressed by a specific
morpheme, the pluralizer -la, occupying the nearest suffix slot after the stem.
In Table 3, the regular font indicates transparent person-number agreement
markers that have single person-number values for particular A/P-arguments, while
the boldface indicates non-transparent agreement markers that do not have a direct
correlation with the person-number values of their respective arguments.

1. As the Table shows, prefixalal S- and A-agreement markers are the same (they are
presented in the first line of the Table). This slot can be occupied by material markers of the 1st
person, as well as the zero marker 56 of the 2nd person sg. Other persons do not have prefixal
agreement markers 57 .
2. The suffix slot is occupied by person-number S- and P-markers (the second and third lines
of the Table respectively). Suffixal person-number S-markers correspond to 2nd person non-sg
and 3rd person, i.e. person-number S-markers are in complementary distribution among the prefix
and suffix slots: S-arguments ‘I’, ‘we’, ‘you (sg)’ have prefixal agreement markers, while ‘you
(non-sg)’, ‘(s)he/it’, ‘they’ have suffix markers. In contrast to S-arguments, all persons of Parguments have corresponding person-number P-markers 58 , material forms of S- and P-markers
being different (the single exception is the marker -tyk ‘2nsg.S/P’).
3. 3rd person P-markers consist of the -n(a) person marker and a number marker. In the56This description differs forms with zero marker and forms that lack any agreement marker.
Practically for particular boxes of the paradigm the descriptive choice depends on systematic
considerations.
57
Here and below lack of an agreement marker is indicated by the dash.
58
The ‘1sg.P’ marker -gym has a restricted usage; see below.","[43, 44, 45]"
"61It is remarkable that only this agreement marker unifies S- and P-markers, cf. Tables 6-7.
The single deviation is conjunctive for 1sg.S/A (t-), coinciding with the markers of
“objective” moods (see Comment 5 to Table 5).
6247The 2nd person optative semantically coincides with the imperative 63 , because exactly in this
speech situation the speaker perlocutively affects the addressee with the speech act.
5. The 1nsg value does not differentiate between the conjunctive and the optative: these
moods have the single myn- agreement marker 64 , in contrast to 1sg. In the context of the
conjunctive 1sg uses the t- marker, identical to the one used in the unmarked moods, and such a
merger takes place only for this person. Probably the maximal degree of control on the part of the
speaker over the desirable event is important: inasmuch as the speaker has an S/A-role in the
event, the probability of its accomplishment is estimated by the speaker to be very close to real
event.
6. A unique 1sg marker is present in the optative (m-). In this mood the speaker is
simultaneously the sender as well as the recipient of the prescription. It should be taken into
account that this mood does not have its own marker and differs from the indicative only by
means of agreement markers, i.e. the speech acts with different S/A-arguments are cognitively
different. The following types of desires are distinguished: a desire addressed to the speaker
himself (m-), addressed to the speaker and other persons (myn-), addressed to the hearer and,
optionally, to other persons (n-) (in the latter case the addressee of desire being virtual rather than
actual).
TABLE 6. Transparent suffixal S-markers63Usually in Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages the mood under consideration is called
imperative, see [Zhukova 1968] (Alutor), [Zhukova 1972] (Koryak), [Volodin 1992] (Kerek),
[Skorik 1977] (Chukchi). However the semantics of 1st and 3rd persons’ S/A-arguments does not
have a perlocutive component of inducement to the action (see the separate analysis of the
meanings of these forms in [Muravyova 1990a]). It should be mentioned that Alutor rarely uses
the imperative proper, see 2.1.3.
64
At that the forms of conjunctive and optative in general are distinct.","[47, 48]"
"52(b) if the A-argument is outranked by the P-argument on the Deictic Hierarchy, the nontransparent marker is needed (it is important that it is the same na- marker).
(c) If the non-locutor A-argument is deictically not lower than the P-argument 71 , the specialportmanteau non-transparent markers are used, whose choice depends on the deictic properties of
the A-argument (-tki ‘you nsg — him/them’; -ni ‘he — him/them’).","[52, 53]"

1.1.1.3. Long and Short e and o
Vowels e and o always appear as long segments in open stressed or open pre-stressed
syllables (that is in the first or the second syllable of an Alutor word − see 1.2), cf.
@ógyv [E] ‘yesterday’, jepílNyn [E] ‘hoof’, tùrak [O] ‘sink’, lJotítkyn [O] ‘top’.
Short e and o are found in several roots in closed stressed and closed prestressed syllables before or after q and H, cf. lóqtyk [e] (along with løqtyk) ‘come
back’, HoptílJHu [o] ‘all’, qùnpyN [o] (along with qãnpyN) ‘always’. In post-stressed
syllables, both open and closed, the vowels e and o are usually short, cf. @ísse [e]
‘aunt’, tytôtoratkyn [o] ‘I'll sink’. The latter situation can be treated as standard
vowel shortening in post-stressed position − see 1.3.7 5 . Short e and o are also found
in non-accentuated auxiliary words (see 1.2.2), cf. &gemat [e] ‘maybe’, &Horo [o]
‘then’ (non-accentuated words are marked with “ & ”).
Long E and O are also found in both open and closed syllables in so-called
“expressive” words, cf. tOk ‘(interjection) let us’ (for more details see 1.3.8.1).
Expressive lengthening of this kind can be found in many languages, but such long
vowels are not considered separate phonemes.
Thus, in Alutor long and short e and o occur in positions that complement each
other. That is why we find it possible to treat a long phone and its short counterpart as
4It is worth mentioning that native speakers of Alutor are not aware of the schwa as a
segment of their pronunciation, whether predictable or not. They think some Alutor words have
only consonants; at the same time, they can easily divide such words into syllables. For instance, a
word which sounds like pyNílly ‘news’ is treated as having three syllables – |p|Nl|l| (the symbol “ |
” indicates syllable boundaries), wítwyt ‘flower’ – as |wt|wt|, HítvyHyt ‘boat’ – as |Ht|v|Ht|. The
same is true for the Koryak language. E.A.Kreynovich [Kreynovich 1958] proposed for Koryak
words the non-vocalised representation (that is without y), but with marked syllable boundaries,
like |wt|wt|. Since the schwa is not part of such representation, the author does not consider it a
phoneme. In our opinion, such approach in neither adequate nor typologically justified, because
there arises a problem of dividing words into syllables – some words have unpredictable syllable
division. Nevertheless, E.A.Kreynovich was the first to pay attention to the crucial importance of
the notion of syllable for Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages. As we will see further, this notion is
absolutely necessary to create well-formed Alutor words.
5
From an historical point of view, the Alutor long E and O originated mostly from aj and
aw, or from yj and yw, and original e and o changed into i and u in most positions (they are
preserved only in closed syllables before or after q and H – see above), cf. the following related
words from Alutor and Koryak: Alutor jepílNyn [E] – Koryak jajpylNyn ‘hoof’, Alutor lJotítkyn
[O] – Koryak lJawtytkyn ‘the top of smth.’, Alutor @imNãlyk – Koryak @emNolyk ‘to miss (smb.)’,
but Alutor lóqtyk – Koryak leqtyk ‘to come back’, Alutor qùnpyN – Koryak qonpyN ‘always’

Identification clauses have the same structure as other nominal clauses: they consist

3.4. Relative clause
In Alutor there are two main means of a relative clause formation — with the help of
the participle construction or the finite subordinate clause.
3.4.1. Participle strategy
The -l@- participle marks the head of a relative clause if both coreferential NPs are
marked with the nominative. The dependent NP can be omitted or reduced to a
relative pronoun maNin/maNki ‘which/where’ often combined with the correlative
pronoun qynut ‘as/such/there’ 127 .

The infinitive forms sentential complements of phasal verbs (with typical meanings
‘begin’ 94 , ‘continue’, ‘finish’). Phasal verbs inherit the transitivity / intransitivity
properties of subordinate verbs marked as the infinitive. In the context of an
intransitive embedded verb the main verb has an intransitive agreement pattern and
agrees with a noun marked with the nominative:

"13In unaccentuated words the vowel length contrast is hardly detectable. It should
be noted that unaccentuated words can be clearly distinguished only if the syllable
supposed to bear stress is an open one, cf. jônut [A] ‘today’ vs. &janut [a] ‘earlier’
(the symbol “ & ” indicates the absence of stress in a word), @inøri [I] ‘blanket’ vs.
&siriri [i] ‘sandpiper’. If such syllable is a closed one, it is more difficult to reveal the
absence of stress.
The position of stress in Alutor can be described in terms of syllable weight,
thus it is a quantity sensitive system. Two types of syllables are distinguished here:
l i g h t (mono-moraic) syllables and h e a v y (bi-moraic) syllables. Syllables of the
|Сy| type are light syllables, while the other types are all heavy.
The position of stress in accentuated words is determined by the following three
phonological constraints:
1) only a heavy syllable can bear stress; light syllables are always unstressed;
2) only the first or the second syllable can bear stress (but the second syllable is
preferable);
3) a word-final syllable cannot bear stress.
These constraints help us to describe all the possible rhythmic patterns. First of
all, a monosyllabic cannot bear stress, for its only syllable is the final one (but there
exist some unaccentuated monosyllablic auxiliary words − see below). In case of a
disyllabic accentuated word, the first syllable is stressed (it always appears to be a
heavy one), for instance, @ôkyk ‘son’, kíttil ‘forehead’, wôla ‘knife’ 20 . Polysyllabics
may have stress either on the first or the second syllable, cf. tølpyqal ‘shoulder’,
tírgytyr ‘meat’, nØgyqin ‘cool’, vitôtyk ‘work’, NyrôlNyn ‘knee’, vagílNyn ‘nail, claw’.
For details see the stress assignment rules (1.3.4.).
The class of unaccentuated words is represented by the following groups and
subgroups:
1) auxiliary words of different types, such as conjunctions, particles,
introductory words, and also some adverbs, cf. &qinaq ‘in order to’, &Horo ‘then’,
&matka ‘whether’, &kytvyl ‘not (prohibition)’, &gemat ‘maybe’, &agi ‘very’, &lygan
‘even’, &wasaq ‘sometimes’, &jaqi ‘later’;
2) some personal pronoun forms, such as:
a) the dative form with a light second syllable, cf. &gymykyN ‘to me’, &gynykyN
‘to you (sg)’, &@ynykyN ‘to him’, &murykyN ‘to us’, &turykyN ‘to you (pl)’, &@ytykyN
20Actually, when morphemes are combined into a word, at intermediate stages there may
appear a monosyllabic word with the only stressed syllable or a disyllabic word with the second
stressed syllable, but such intermediate representations are then extended by means of some
special rules (see 1.3.4.3), cf. Nôjjy (< Nôj < {Naj-∅}) ‘mountain’, Nyvã-jjy (< Nyvã-j < {Nvu-j})
‘(s)he/it began’, gyvô-kki (< gyvô-k < {gva-k}) ‘to stick’.","[13, 14]"

agreement slot in polypersonal conjugation. In monopersonal conjugation agreement
is controlled by the P-argument.
I n t r a n s i t i v e verbs have one core S-argument marked with the nominative
that controls the suffix agreement slot in monopersonal conjugation and both
agreement slots in polypersonal conjugation.
From the point of view of case marking Alutor uses the e r g a t i v e
alignment 117 , unifying the S/P-arguments (with the Absolutive hyperrole) and
opposing them to the A-argument. Monopersonal conjugation is analogous (the
Absolutive is the agreement controller). An interpretation of polypersonal conjugation
is more controversial. Namely, the S-, A- and P-arguments use different sets of
controlled agreement slots: The S-arguments control the prefix as well as suffix slots,
the A-arguments control the prefix slots and the P-arguments control the suffix slots.
Therefore, from the point of view of polypersonal conjugation the t r i p a r t i t e
alignment is realized. From the point of view of the marker's material form, the prefix
markers bring the A- and S-arguments in line with t h e a c c u s a t i v e alignment
(with the Principal hyperrole), opposing them to the P-argument; see 2.1.1.2.
In the suffix slots the sets of S- and P-markers are different, therefore the suffix
slot realizes the tripartite alignment opposing the S/A/P-arguments.
In Alutor there are different means of including a verb's arguments into the set
of core arguments as well as excluding them from the set of core arguments. The first
process is called i n c r e a s e , and the second one d e c r e a s e of their syntactic status.
These processes often take place simultaneously as the status of some argument
increases while the status of another one decreases.
From the point of view of the increase/decrease of the syntactic status, the
nominative position is the most important. This position is always present in a clause
(it can lack material form in the context of ambient verbs or in case of ellipsis). It is
the target of all increasing processes. Therefore, the Absolutive hyperrole can
correspond to different primary semantic roles. In contrast to the nominative position,
the ergative position is stable from the point of view of its role identification: it
merges the agent and experiencer in the Agentive hyperrole. Almost always, it is the
initial position of the government pattern of the respective verb 118 . The only exception117For a more detailed discussion of the typology of syntactic constructions and the
corresponding hyperroles see [Kibrik 1997a].

This position can be added in the case of causativization, however in this case it is a
derivational process producing a new lexeme rather that a diathesis change.","[110, 111]"

same context.

1.2. Syllable and Rhythmic structure
1.2.1. Syllable Structure
Alutor imposes strict conditions on syllable structure, and the notion of syllable is
essential for the phonological pattern of the Alutor language.
If we consider the main classes of sounds − consonants and vowels − the
canonical syllable patterns will be |CV| and |CVC| (the symbol “ | ” indicates a
syllable boundary). These patterns have only one constraint: if the nucleus of a
syllable is a long vowel, the syllable has no coda. Thus, in reality we find the
following syllable patterns: |Cy|, |СVshort|, |CVlong|, |CyC|, |СVshortC| (here V is a nonschwa vowel), cf. |vi|tô|tyk| ‘work’, |tøl|my|til| ‘eagle’, |@øt|@yn| ‘fur coat’, |@a|lô|@al|
‘summer’, |jØ|ly|jil| ‘tongue’, |wi|rã|wir| ‘(kind of) salmon’, |ja|tít|kyn| ‘(s)he is
coming’.
The set of syllable patterns given above is valid only if we consider a careful,
distinct pronunciation, which we will call the standard pronunciation. In fluent speech
native speakers may often elide the schwa in a two or three consonant cluster (one of
the consonants is usually a sonorant), so there may appear some consonant clusters,
illicit in the standard pronunciation. Thus, we often find optional words pronounced
of other syllable types, such as |CCV| and |CCVC|, cf. qylôvul ~ qlôvul ‘husband’,
@ínkyjap ~ @ínkjap ‘long ago’ 17 . In the present paper we prefer to deal only with the
standard pronunciation.
Word boundaries in Alutor always coincide with syllable boundaries, for
instance, @ógyv|#@arNønati (not *@ógy|v#ar|Nønati) ‘It rained yesterday’.
In reduplications the boundary between the two root morphs also coincides with
the syllable boundary, cf. @ønmy|@in (< {inm=in}) ( not *@in|min) ‘gulp’. The same is
true with incorporations and productive compounds, but only if the second stem
begins with a vowel, cf. mis@ô=@it@yl@yn (< {mis@a=it-l@-n}) ‘the one in a beautiful
fur coat’, sasø=@ilNatgyrNyn (< {sasi=ilN-at-gyrN-n}) ‘watchstrap’. In some
compounds there is no glottal stop before an initial vowel of the second stem, and the
syllable begins with a preceding consonant, cf. tig-ølNyn (< {tig-ilN-N}) ‘ski strap’.
17The same situation is found in related languages. Some Koryak dictionaries (for instance,
[Korsakov 1939a]) register the standard pronunciation, while others (for instance, [Zhukova
1967]) record the fluent speech, cf. myjen ~ mjen ‘mosquito’. As P.Ja.Skorik writes [Skorik
1961:63], in Chukchi the process of omitting schwas “ is more widely spread in the western
dialect than in the eastern one”.","[10, 11, 12]"
"26in syllable-final position vowel-and-glide combinations aj (not immediately
before j), aw (not immediately before w, v), a@ produce long vowels E, O, A
respectively 38 , i.e.
(10) a. aj ⇒ E / ( _ |# or _ |C1) and C1≠j
b. aw ⇒ O / ( _ |# or _ |C1) and C1≠w,v
c. a@ ⇒ A / _ |# or _ |C1
Examples: nymróqin (< {n-mraj-qin}) ‘right’, cf. nymrôjigym ‘right (1sg)’;
@inóvykli (< @inajvykli < {ina-jvykl-j}) ‘(s)he hit me’, cf. jyvíklynin ‘(s)he hit
him/her’; rarópyN (< {rara-jpyN}) ‘along a house’, cf. rurãjpyN ‘along a bed place’;
rarôkinegym (< rarakinEgym < {rara-kina-jgym}) ‘the one from the house (1sg)’,

wyjølatyk ‘cast a shadow’, @inùjivatyk (< @inawjivatyk < {ina-gjiv-at-k}) ‘show’, cf.
gyjøvatyk ‘show (smth.)’; @ílla (< yllA < {ylla@-∅}) ‘mother’, cf. @yllô@-a ‘with a
mother’, kôla (< kalA < {kala@-∅}) ‘idol’, cf. kalô@-a ‘by an idol’.
No coalescence takes place in case of geminates jj, ww (the glottal stop does not
occur syllable-finally before @), cf. tylôjjy ‘(s)he came’, @awwôka ‘do not be
caught!’.
The coalescence of the schwa and a glide follows the rules:
in syllable-final position schwa-and-glide combinations yj (not immediately
before j), yw (not immediately before w), y@ produce vowels E/i, O/u, A respectively:
vowels E, O appear in root-initial position (and also in the suffixes -jpyN, -jt which are
treated as roots in this respect 39 ), vowels i, u − in root-final position and in (other)
suffixes (including the suffix -jpyN − optionally) 40 , i.e.
(11) a. yj ⇒ E / _ |C1 and j = root-initial and C1 ≠ j
b. yj ⇒ i / (_ |# or _ |C1) and (j = root-final or j = suffix-initial) and C1 ≠ j
c. yw ⇒ O / _ |C1 and w = root-initial and C1≠w
d. yw ⇒ u / (_ |# or _ |C1) and (w = root-final or w = suffix-initial) and C1 ≠
w
e. y@ ⇒ A / _ |C1 and C1 ≠ @
Examples: tóvyklyn (< {t-jvykl-n}) ‘I hit him/her’, cf. jyvíklynin ‘(s)he hit
him/her’; winvópyN ~ winvøpyN (< {winv-jpyN}) ‘along a road’, cf. rurã-jpyN ‘along a
38But in post-stressed position these vowels appear as short ones (see 1.3.7).
These suffixes obviously originated from the roots {jp} and {jt}.
40
This process seems to be related to the rhythmic structure: the vowels i , u, a appear as
short correlates of the long vowels E, O, A in non-stressed position, cf. the unique reduplication

No coalescence takes place in case of geminates jj, ww (the glottal stop does not
occur syllable-finally before @), cf. qytíjjy ‘(s)he went away’, tíwwak ‘I stuck’.
In some rare cases the combination “the vowel i + the glide j ” 41 also coalesces.
The change follows the rule:
in syllable-final position a combination ij (not immediately before j) produces
the corresponding long vowel I, i.e.
(12) ij ⇒ I / _ |C1 and C1 ≠ j
Examples: @imtØpytkyn (< {imti-jp-tky-n}) ‘(s)he is carrying it on (his/her)
back’.
1.3.7. Vowel Reduction
Alutor demonstrates quantitative and qualitative vowel reduction in pre-stressed and
post-stressed positions.
In pre-stressed position only the vowel a is reduced; the alternation a/y takes
place in some monosyllabic prefixes ending in a, and more rarely − in some roots 42 .
The qualitative reduction follows the rule:
in an open pre-stressed syllable a vowel a is reduced immediately before H and
appears as y (provided it is not the prefix a), i.e.
(13) a ⇒ y / _HVstressed and a ≠ Pref a
Examples: gyHônqavlin (< {ga-Hanqa-v-lin}) ‘(s)he stopped’, cf. @a-Hônqavka ‘(s)he did not stop’; tyHírsaN (< {taHyr-saN}) ‘how many times’, cf. tôHyr ‘how
many’, jyHølgyn (< {jaHilg-n}) ‘moon’, cf. nyjôHisgyqin ‘moonlit’.
Quantitative reduction is typical of long vowels and occurs in post-stressed
41It would be natural to expect the coalescence uw => U, but it is unattested in Alutor (the
combination uw occurs only before w).
42
This rule may have some reference to the irregular distribution of alternates ô and y found
in the root {la@u / ly@u / s@u} ‘to see’, cf. ty-lô@u-tkyn ‘I see him/it’, but ly@ã-kki ‘to see’, @inJôs@u-k ‘to seek’.","[26, 27, 28]"
"Similarly to adjectives, possessive pronouns may become substantivized. In
such cases, they are inflected using 1st or 2nd declension forms, depending on their
referent (non-human/ human respectively).
2.4.3. Demonstrative pronouns
Viewed from their morphological properties, demonstrative pronominal adjectives are
similar to relative adjectives (see 2.2.2); they usually consist of the demonstative root
plus the suffix {-in(a)} 112 . The main Alutor demonstrative adjectives are: {ynN.in(a)}
‘this’,
{wut.in(a)/wutt.in(a)/wutt.aq}
‘this’,
{Nan.in(a)/Nan.ka}
‘that’,
{igynNin(a)} ‘such’.
The demonstratives are used both attributively and without a head noun. Being
used attributively, demonstratives agree with their head noun in person and number,
the markers being the same as for other adjectives with the suffix -in(a).
Being used without a head noun, they function like the 3rd person pronouns. In
this case demonstratives are inflected using 1st or the 2nd declension forms
depending on their referent (non-human/ human respectively). The most frequent
case-number forms are shown in the Dictionary 113 .
Compare the following examples:

"9most cases it is a plosive, but sometimes it sounds like an affricate 13 .
Laryngeals deserve special consideration. The glottal stop @ is sometimes used
as an auxiliary segment, for instance, it is found before any word-initial vowel. In
such contexts the glottal stop is predictable: it is inserted in accordance with the
standard rules (see 1.3.3.1). But in other contexts this segment is unpredictable, so it
must be treated as part of the underlying representation, cf. ny@ôlyk (< {n@al-k})
‘become’ (the root {n@al}), @yllô@a (< {ylla@-a}) ‘by a mother’ (the root {ylla@}),
nymôl@a (< {n-mal-@a}) ‘well’ (the circumfix {n-...-@a}). In syllable-final position
the glottal stop behaves similar to the glides w and j (see 1.3.6). The sound H is an
epiglottal plosive laryngeal, that is a glottal stop accompanied by epiglottis
lowering 14 . Due to such configuration the larynx becomes closed and the pharynx is
narrowed in its lower part. Like the uvular q, the Alutor H is also slightly
pharyngealized. That is why both q and H make the adjacent vowels more wide. There
is an obvious contrast between the sounds @ and H, cf. jã@yk ‘reach’ − vøHyk ‘die’, but
the fact was not mentioned in previous papers on Alutor 15 .
1.1.2.3. Sonorants
Among the sonorants the most numerous group is the nasals; here we find the labial
m, two dentals – the non-palatalized n and the palatalized nJ, and the velar N.
Laterals are represented by the non-palatalized l and the palatalized lJ.
The palatalized dentals nJ and lJ belong to the same place of articulation as their
non-palatalized correlates l and n. The non-palatalized dentals t, n and l, like all other
non-palatalized sounds, are not velarized 16 , that is why they do not velarise the
following front vowels. It should be also noted that the opposition n/nJ, l/lJ is not
neutralized before the front vowels, so both variants − a palatalized and a nonpalatalized one − occur there (cf. kôlik ‘write’ vs. kalJøsityk ‘write (repeatedly)’).
The remainder of the sonorants do not require special comment. The consonants
13That is why in Russian borrowings the Russian fricative x changes into the Alutor q, cf.
qylJøppy ‘bread’ (from the Russian xl’eb), @ãrvaq ‘shirt, dress’ (from the Russian rubáxa), &kolqos
‘collective farm’ (from the Russian kolxóz).
14
In the Koryak language [Zhukova 1972] the corresponding phoneme is realised as the
fricative pharyngeal and is written in the transcription as h.
15
The initial Alutor @ corresponds to the Koryak laryngeal @, while the non-initial Alutor @
and H (the latter – both initially and non-initially) correspond to the Koryak pharyngeal fricative
H, cf. the corresponding Koryak words jãHyk ‘reach’, vøHyk ‘die’.
16
Actually, sometimes there occurs a velarized variant of l (we often transcribed this sound
as w, not as l), but this may be due to the influence of the Russian language, where l is strongly
velarized.","[9, 10]"
"2.1.1.2.4. Combined non-transparent markers
Above pure non-transparent agreement markers of “objective” moods (indicative and
potential) were considered. The majority of these markers have no modal values,
however, na- has this form in the “objective” moods only. In the conjunctive it is
realized as yn-, and in the optative as nan- (see the paradigm for transitive verbs in
Appendix).
The occurrence of the portmanteau -gy non-transparent marker is more specific
(see the optative paradigm in Appendix and in Table 9). This marker is licensed in the
context of arguments with the deictic properties: ‘2.A + 3.P’. Moreover, it is
combined with the optative and is sensitive to aspect values.
72B.Comrie calls these forms pseudo-intransitive [Comrie 1980].
This is also supported by the co-occurence of this marker with the non-transparent marker
–gy; see below.

2nsg A-argument, i.e. it shares the distribution with the marker -tki and follows the
above-mentioned rule (d).
However in perfective this marker co-occurs also with 2sg A-arguments. In the
context of the perfective the rule for this marker looks as follows:
(e) If in the perfective optative the A-argument is a hearer that is deictically
higher than the P-argument (i.e. in situations such as ‘you sg/nsg — him/them’), then
the non-transparent marker -gy is necessary.
2.1.1.2.5. Pluralizer insertion
It was said above that 1st/2nd person S/A-markers are distinguished in only the
singular and non-singular 75 , whereas suffixal 3rd person S- and P-markers are
distinguished in the singular, dual, and plural (see Tables 6-7). The main means used
by agreement to contrast dual vs. plural is a specific marker, a so-called p l u r a l i z e r
( -la) that has a special linear slot (rank +1, see Table 1) 76 . T h e s c o p e o f
p l u r a l i z a t i o n is:
74It should be taken into consideration that these forms are very rare in the speech. In texts
(Part I) only one occurence of this marker in the optative imperfective was found. There are also
some divergences between the paradigm presented in this volume and the paradigm in [Zhukova
1968: 304-05]: in the latter paradigm there are forms q-.....-tkyni-gy-na-t ‘2sg.A+OPT-....-IPF2.A+3-3.P-du’, q-.....-tkyni-gy-na-w ‘2sg.A+OPT-....-IPF-2.A+3-3.P-pl’.

"In this way, the antipassive is not obligatorily followed by a decrease in
transitivity; see (10b).
In Alutor there are verbs that are always accompanied by the ina- marker, for
example, in.emy- ‘scoop, draw’ (etymologically bound with the intransitive verb
emy- ‘go for water’). This verb has three arguments (agent, patient, and instrument),
optionally complemented by benefactive. The interpretation is possible that in
primary diathesis there is no argument that fills the highest position, therefore the
location of any argument in this position is marked with the inversion marker:

In a number of cases the use of the antipassive is motivated by the
c o m m u n i c a t i v e s t r u c t u r e of an utterance, namely by the need of the speaker
to focus attention on an argument occupying a non-central position in the verbal
government pattern or, conversely, to remove an argument from a pragmatically
salient position. Thus in the following examples the use of the antipassive is
motivated by the need to remove the patient from the utterance:116(12) a. ...ina-tg.aty-tkyn

"96a, the morph -jpyN appears as -epyN; the same variant is used if a stem ends in a two
consonant cluster, because in such cases the epenthetic y is inserted, and the
combination yj in most cases changes into e, though in some rare cases – into i (see
1.3.6), so the marker -ipyN 105 may appear, cf. qaNJav-gypyN ‘ravine, PROLAT’, nutepyN (< {nuta-jpyN}) ‘land, PROLAT’, winv-epyN ~ winv-ipyN (< winvy 106 -jpyN <
{winv-jpyN}) ‘road, PROLAT’. The morphs -e and -i are short variants of the morphs
-epyN and -ipyN respectively.
The equative markers -u/-nu have the same distribution as the ergative markers
-a/-ta: the variant -u is used with stems ending in a consonant or a schwa, while the
variant -nu is used with stems ending in a non-schwa vowel, cf. tavHal-u ‘dried fish,
EQUAT’, keN-u (< {keNy-u}) ‘bear, EQUAT’, but ypa-nu ‘soup, EQUAT’.
The variants -a/-ta in the comitative and associative are identical with those of
the ergative and have the same distribution, cf. ga-qlavul-a ‘husband, COMIT’, gamasla-ta ‘butter, COMIT’, geqy-masla-ta ‘butter, ASSOC’.
2.3.1.2. Case functions
Below we enumerate the main functions of the Alutor cases.
The n o m i n a t i v e is used mostly to express the syntactic function of an S/Pactant, that is the Absolutive hyperrole, according to the ergative actant marking
strategy (see 3.0). The nominative (not a bare stem) is also used to express named
objects. Besides this, the nominative is used in the vocative position, with final vowel
lengthening (we treat this process as expressive vowel lengthening − see 1.3.8.1), for
instance, in the vocative we may use miti along with mitE 107 ‘Oh, Miti!’ (Miti is a
mythological woman’s name).
The e r g a t i v e is used to express the following functions: a) the A-actant of a
verb, that is the actant with an Agentive hyperrole, b) the instrument of an action, c)
the lowered actant of a verb in the antipassive construction (see 3.1.3.1). Beside the
Agent, the Agentive hyperrole in Alutor also includes the Experiencer. Thus, the
Agentive hyperrole is typical for verbs such as ‘take’, ‘cut’ (the Agent) / ‘see’, ‘wish’
(the Experiencer):

3rd person forms are most closely related to its prototypical meaning, while 2nd
person forms are the natural extension of this meaning towards semantics of the
imperative 93 .
2.1.7.4. Conjunctive
The conjunctive's semantics is related to an event P that is desirable for the speaker,
but is not realized in the actual world. In contrast to the optative, also related to the
domain of desirability, the conjunctive represents the desirability of event P as a
given, without the speaker's aim to participate actively in the event. The degree of
reality of an event can vary, from highly probable, especially if the speaker is the
actor of the event, to irreal— in conditional clauses. Conjunctive verb forms are
translated in different ways.
Forms in the 1sg actor conjunctive are translated as “should not I do P”, where
P is denoted by the conjunctive verb form:

1. As mentioned above, the ‘2nsg.S’ marker, -tyk, is largely independent from aspect/mood
values, and also identical to the ‘2nsg.P’ marker (see Table 7).
2. In contrast to the imperfective 65 , the perfective tends to be combined with specific locutor
suffixal markers (absent only in the perfective potential 66 ). 1st person agreement markers are
identical for the indicative, conjunctive, and optative. In these moods the singular is -k ‘1sg.S+PF’
marker, non-singular is -myk ‘1nsg.S+PF’ (identical to the marker ‘1nsg.P’). As with the 2nd
person singular, its markers are also combined with mood values: -j ‘2sg+PF+IND’, -n
‘2sg+PF+CONJ’, -gi ‘2sg+PF+OPT’.
3. Usually in the context of perfective potential (with the final component -N) and the
singular S-arguments the suffixal agreement markers are absent (see Appendix), however
sporadically the marker -i (the same for all persons 67 ) appears, thus it can be given a value of
‘sg.S+PF+POT’.
4. It should be mentioned that an interpretation of the empty suffix slot for ‘2sg.S+PF.POT’
is complicated. The proposed interpretation (the lack of markers) is motivated by the locutor
status of ‘2sg’, merging with the 1st person. However another interpretation is also possible, that
is, the existence of a zero marker. The following generalizations favor this interpretation: if it is
true, then (a) the tendency for the 2nd and 3rd persons to merge into singular markers becomes
stronger, (b) 2nd person singular in the perfective always has a suffix marker.
5. The 3rd person has its own subsystem, for clarity presented in Table 6a. First, 3rd person65In this aspect locutors do not have overt suffix markers, see Comment 7 below about
marker -t ‘1pl.S’ in imperfective aspect.

Incorporation is a device that simplifies the syntactic structure of a clause. It121decreases the syntactic rank of constituents that are out of the scope of assertion and,
more generally, beyond the focus of attention 124 . If incorporation affects the
constituent that occupies a prestigious position in a clause, it opens the possibility of
raising the status of another constituent occupying a peripheral position in the initial
structure.
Along with this, it is possible to confirm the usage of incorporation for the
purpose of overcoming syntactic restrictions over syntactic structure. For example, l@- participles form reduced relative clauses whose nominative argument is
coreferential with the head NP. With respect to this restriction it is sometimes
necessary to free the nominative position, incorporating the P-argument of a transitive
verb:

Quantitative reduction follows the rule:
a long vowel is shortened in post-stressed position, i.e.
(14) Vlong ⇒ Vshort / Vstressed ..._
Examples: HÔlyHal (< HAly=HAl < {HAlyred}) ‘axe’, rarôtenyk (< {rara-tEny-k})
‘near a house’, rarôkinegym (< rara-kin-Egym < {rara-kina-jgym}) ‘the one from a
house (1sg)’, @í11a (< yllA < {ylla@-∅}) ‘mother’.
1.3.8. Fortitions
Fortitions are represented in Alutor by the following two phonological processes:
1) expressive vowel lengthening;
2) consonant gemination.
1.3.8.1. Expressive Vowel Lengthening
Expressive vowel lengthening takes place in certain “expressive” words − the
“distant” vocative, the “distant” locative and others. Although expressive vowel
lengthening is not a regular process, we think it possible to give here approximate
rules:
in expressive words short vowels y, a, i, u change into mid long vowels O, O, E, O
respectively, i.e.
(15) a. y ⇒ O / in expressive words
b. a ⇒ O / in expressive words
c. i ⇒ E / in expressive words
d. u ⇒ O / in expressive words
Examples: NOnyk (< {Nan-k} ‘there far away (the distant locative)’, cf. Nônyk
‘there’; @ômkykO (< {a-mk-ka} ‘very many’, cf. @ômkyka ‘many’; &mitE (< {miti∅}) ‘oh, Miti (the distant vocative)’ , cf. &miti ‘‘oh, Miti (a mythological proper
name)’, &@awEn (< {awin}, the contracted form of {awinaN-∅}) ‘oh, crab (the
distant vocative)’ along with @awønaN ‘oh, crab’.
1.3.8.2. Consonant Gemination
In some rare cases the root-final obstruent t is geminated, so that the preceding
syllable becomes closed. The process is partly morphologically defined, since roots
geminating their final consonants form a restricted group of the lexicon (the
corresponding words are given in the Dictionary). Some roots ending in t do not
demonstate this alternation, cf. arôt-i ‘(s)he fell’.
The rule regulating consonant gemination runs as follows:
if a root is marked for gemination, its root-final obstruent t is geminated29immediately before a word-final vowel, provided the preceding vowel is a stressed
one, i.e.
(16) t ⇒ tt / #CVstressed _-V2# and t ∈ Rgemination
Examples: jôtti (< jôt-i < {jat-j}) ‘(s)he came’; cf. tyjôtytkyn (< {t-jat-tkyn}) ‘I
am coming’.
Consonant gemination is obviously related to syllable addition when the
consonant is geminated too − see 1.3.8.2.
1.3.9. Regular Contact Consonant Assimilations
Contact assimilation of consonants is a wide spread phenomenon not only in Alutor,
but also in its related languages − Chukchi and Koryak. Most Alutor assimilations are
regressive, but some are progressive. In Alutor assimilations take place only
intervocalicly (that is at a syllable boundary). In some cases an intervocalic position
appears after an epenthetic schwa has been inserted, for instance, gônmylin (< {gatm-lin}) ‘(s)he killed him/her’. Most changes given below occur irrespective of a
morpheme boundary between the changing segment X and the context (but
assimilations are optional at a composite boundary). In order to simplify the formal
rules we omit here syllable and morpheme boundary markers. It should also be noted
that the dental t of a person-number verbal prefix is not assimilated at a morpheme
boundary before a root consonant (this information is also omitted in the rules), cf.
mytlô@utkyn (= {myt-la@u-tky-n}) ‘we see him/her/it’.
The following types of assimilation occur in Alutor:
1) partial assimilation of the dental t before nasals, namely:
at a syllable boundary an obstruent dental t changes into the corresponding
nasal (of the same place of articulation) immediately before a nasal m, n, nJ, or N
(see also rule (19)), i.e.
(17) a. t ⇒ n / _m
b. t ⇒ n / _n or _nJ
c. t ⇒ n / _N
Examples: gônmylin (< {ga-tm-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he is killed’, @akminnin (< {akmit-ni-n}) ‘(s)he took him/her/it’, varônJnJaqu (< varan-nJaqu < {varat-nJaqu-∅}) ‘a
lot of people’, ganNôlin (< {ga-tNa-lin(a)}) ‘it grew’.
2) complete assimilation of the dental t before sonorant dentalveolars, namely:
at a syllable boundary an obstruent dental t changes into the corresponding
sonorant immediately before a sonorant dentalveolar 1, 1J, or r (see also rules (17)
and (19)), i.e.
(18) a. t ⇒ l / _l or _lJ
b. t ⇒ r / _r30Examples: vitôllat (< {vit-at-la-t}) ‘they worked’, tírran (< {t-tra-n) ‘I tore
it’.
3) contact dentalveolar palatalization, namely:
at a syllable boundary a non-palatalized dentalveolar t, n, or l changes into its
palatalized correlate immediately before the corresponding palatalized
dentalalveolar s, nJ, or lJ respectively, i.e.
(19) a. t ⇒ s / _s
b. n ⇒ nJ / _nJ
c. l ⇒ lJ / _lJ
Examples: @arôssityk (< {arat-sit-k}) ‘pour’, mytônJnJaqu (< {mtan-nJaqu})
‘big mosquito’, @ystãlJlJyqyk (< ystul-lJyqy-k < {ystul-lJq-k}) ‘on a table’.
4) palatalization of the sonorant dentals n, l before the palatal j (here both
segments change), namely:
at a syllable boundary a non-palatalized dental n or l together with the
following palatal j change into the corresponding geminated palatalized dental nJnJ
or lJlJ respectively, i.e.
(20) a. nj ⇒ nJnJ
b. lj ⇒ lJlJ
Examples: tínJnJun (< ty-nju-n < {t-nju-n}) ‘I guarded him/her/it’, tilJlJøta (<
{til-jita}) ‘by a wing’.
5) complete assimilation of the nasal n before sonorant dentoalveolars, namely:
at a syllable boundary a sonorant nasal n changes into the corresponding
sonorant dentalveolar immediately before a sonorant dentalveolar l or r, i.e.
(21) a. n ⇒ l / _l
b. n ⇒ r / _r
Examples (this assimilation is attested only for the medial variant of the
causative marker -n-): tyllóvyn (< {t-n-levy-n}) ‘I took him/her/it (with me)’,
tyrrItylavyn (< {t-n-rItyla-av-n}) ‘I saw him/her/it in (my) dream’.
6) complete assimilation of the uvular q, namely:
at a syllable boundary an obstruent uvular q changes into k when it is
immediately preceded by a velar k, i.e.
(22) q ⇒ k / _k
Examples: tôkkin (< {taq-kin(a)}) ‘why’.
7) complete progressive assimilation of the labial v , namely:
at a syllable boundary an obstruent labial v changes into w immediately after a
labial w, i.e.
(23) v ⇒ w / w_
Examples: tíwwak (< ty-wva-k < {t-gva-k}) ‘I stuck’.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
