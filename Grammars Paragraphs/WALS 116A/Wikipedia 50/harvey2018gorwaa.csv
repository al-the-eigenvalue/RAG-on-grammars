"With the aim of a synchronic description in mind, and having seen the evidence
in (4.36)-(4.39), a valid question that may be asked is whether stems are nominal
at all. The answer to be developed here is yes, but not in a primitive sense. In
many works, including Marantz (2001), Arad (2003, 2005), Borer (2005a, b), and
Merchant (2018), it is argued that lexical items enter the derivation without a
predetermined lexical category, and that this category is realized by their larger
syntactic context. Therefore, the pair wa/aangw ‘arroyo’ and waá/ ‘to vomit’ are
formed of the same categoriless base, wa/aangw coming to be a noun through its
larger nominal structure, and waá/ coming to be a verb through its larger verbal
structure. A (rudimentary) example of what a nominal structure versus a verbal
structure might look like is offered below, where √x refers to the categoriless
base (i.e. root) common to both wa/aangw and waá/.11

"The term ‘topic’ marker is not particularly satisfactory for this form, as it occurs in
several, seemingly disparate morphosyntactic environments, including on the object
of comparison (2.245), on nouns quantified by umó (2.246), as part of the negative
morphology for nominals (2.247), and on polar questions (2.248).",[179]

"4.4.3 The internal structure of the stem
Having determined above that establishing any two instances of a given stem is
not always possible using phonetic or semantic criteria, we will begin this
subsection by posing the question of whether the stem may even be considered
nominal in nature. All the examples in this section thus far (4.23)-(4.35) would
indicate yes: the elements identified as stems consistently occur as part of a
larger noun. Consider, however, the following:2324. Fundamentals: nominal structure and noun stems

semantic criteria (an arroyo is a dry river bed which occasionally floods, an
action evocative of vomiting). However, the example in (a) is a noun, and the
example in (b) is a verb. Similar examples are given below, where (4.37) is a
noun-verb pair, (4.38) is a noun-adjective pair, and (4.39) features a noun, a

Negation is accomplished in Gorwaa by the enclitic =ká(ng). The following provides
an overview of verbal negation, nominal negation, and clausal negation (in Gorwaa,
derivational negation (such as the un- in English unhappy), has not been identified).
Finally, a creative usage of the enclitic =ká(ng) is described.

Negative clauses are marked by the negative clitic =káng (often reduced to =ká).
This clitic attaches to verb roots only if the roots have been extended by the suffix -a

Once bundled and backed up, data was then transcribed and translated. Audio and
video files were synchronized in the ELAN Linguistic Annotator software
programme (2011) and transcribed in the working Gorwaa orthography, then
translated into Swahili and English. In the beginning, this was conducted largely by
the researcher with help from speaker Ayí Raheli Lawi. This method proved
extremely time consuming, and was later vastly improved by employing three local
speakers: Stephano Edward, Paschal Bu’ú, and Festo Massani, who would take the
prepared ELAN files onto an 8GB USB on a weekly basis and translate and transcribe
them independently using HP Stream 11.6 inch HD laptop computers.
Following transcription and translation, the researcher would once again take the
ELAN files, review the transcription and translations in order to make sure the
orthography was consistent with the rest of the corpus, and then gloss the materials.
Files were exported from ELAN to the Fieldworks Language Explorer programme
(FLEx) (SIL, 2015) and glossed using the parsing tool. Glosses were checked,
adjusted, and corrected, and material was then re-exported from FLEx back to
ELAN. These new files were backed up, and then uploaded to the ELAR archive,
once again using Archive Builder.
Data collection tools were not often employed, with much of the elicited material
collected through translation exercises, and much of the naturalistic material simply
being volunteered by participants. Sophie Salffner provided a set of wooden bricks
for a speech activity in which one speaker had to build an unseen model with the
verbal cues of a friend on the other side of a partition (see also the description of641. Introduction
‘Block Worlds’ in Salffner 2015:254-255). I also used two identical sets of twenty
cow photos, of which a subset was given to one speaker, who had to help a second
speaker choose the identical image from their set by describing how it looked. The
same activity was also conducted with a set of bird photos. The Comparative
African Wordlist (SILCAWL) (Snider & Roberts 2006), as well as the SIL
RapidWords (SIL International) questions were also used with a focus on eliciting
new nouns. Old recordings of Gorwaa music from Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam
(Kirombo & Ndumbalo 1967) also served as useful stimuli for further discussion.
Time spent in the field totaled twenty-six months. This was divided into three
individual periods: a thirteen-month period for research associated with Master’s
degree between October 2012 and October 2013, and then two periods for Doctorallevel research: nine months between July 2015 and March 2016, and three months
between September 2016 and November 2016. Figure (1.2) below shows
approximately how many minutes of recordings were collected during each month
of fieldwork, as well as what type of material this was. Natural speech refers to
recordings made with the least amount of input or constraint imposed from the
researcher: they range from traditional songs and stories, to procedural
descriptions of how to complete an everyday task. Prompted speech refers to
recordings made in which the participant (or participants) respond within a larger
context contrived by the researcher: the picture-matching task described above is
one example. Elicitation refers to recordings made in highly-controlled situations:
generally in a question-answer format in which the researcher presents a phrase for651. Introduction
translation or back-translation, or asks for a grammaticality judgment. Consent
refers to the recordings of the scripted consent dialogue, as given in (1.1) above.","[62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"
"However, even if paradigms are predominantly post-syntactic in their content,
they are not external to the grammar. Asking questions of how the paradigms
come to realize the information they encode is important for understanding
grammar post-Spellout. More intriguingly, it will be seen that a proper
understanding of paradigms allows for novel approaches to nominal structure,
as well as common phenomena such as gender and agreement.",[340]
"A similar line of argument may be used to establish that slee in (7.12)a) is not
within TP. Given that this noun occurs to the left of the selector, it is therefore
outside of the syntactic unit. This raises a more fundamental question: if nouns
such as slee in (7.12)a) are not part of the TP, then where, exactly, are they? I
argue that, with the exception of nouns such as those in (7.12)b) described
above, all overt nominal expressions in Gorwaa are base-generated outside of the
TP as adjuncts. Evidence for this claim will be provided in examining free word
order, syntactically discontinuous expressions, and pervasive NP-drop: all key
characteristics of non-configurationality (Jelinek 1984).",[399]

Reexamining the relationship of pro and the paradigm n in relation to the search
domain of D (see Figure 7.1), it is clear that pro is the specifier of n, but that the
probe-goal relation in question (i.e. agree between D and n) does not involve the
complement of n (which is √ ), but involves n itself. As such, the Equidistance
Condition does not apply, and pro may serve as an intervener to agreement
operations of D targeting the paradigm n.

why.
-Is it alright if other people listen to or watch the recordings we have
made? Other researchers? Students? Your family? Other people from
this area?
-Is it alright if I tell other people that you are working on the Gorwaa
language with me? For example, is it alright if I put your name on a list of
people who have contributed to this work? If not, is it alright if I refer to
you by a made-up name? (ask for alias)
-Is it alright if I put our work in a language archive? A language archive is
a place where you can put work like this, so that even if my personal

-Is it alright if I write (books) about the Gorwaa language?
-Is it alright if I use this work for other purposes? For example, perhaps
today I have made a recording to help me understand the sounds of
Gorwaa. Is it alright if I listen to this work at a later date to learn about

of work. Time worked referred to time spent with researcher, even if this was
not recorded. Rehearsing narratives, doing ‘practice-runs’ of elicitation
questions, finding suitable locations to record, etc. all counted toward paid time.
In 2015, 4,000 Tanzanian shillings was equivalent to approximately 1.85 GBP. A
Tanzanian secondary school teacher at the lower end of their pay-scale in 2015
could expect to earn approximately the same. Thus, this was an hourly amount
which seemed commensurate with the skill set of a language consultant.
Participants who were known in the community as specialists (diviners or581. Introduction
traditional healers, for example) would sometimes be paid slightly more. In
most cases, participants were paid in cash. In some cases (such as individuals
dealing with issues such as gambling addictions or alcoholism), salaries were
paid in commodities such as sugar, rice, or airtime vouchers.
126 Gorwaa speakers are represented in the sample.4 With this said, however,
the amount of material from each participant varies greatly, from over 20 hours’
worth of targeted elicitation with one participant, to perhaps a single utterance
in the background of a group discussion from another. Indeed, I estimate that
10% of the participants make up for close to 80% of the recordings.
Of the participants, 88 were male and 38 were female. This disparity in gender
representation was due to several factors, the most important perhaps being that
I am male, and I was therefore often limited in the age range of women with
whom it was deemed appropriate to have contact, as well as in what kinds of
women’s domains I could effectively work. For example, older women were
generally deemed appropriate to work with, whereas opportunities to work with
younger women around my age were not very common. This also has to do with
the disproportionate amount of labour expected of younger women: with
virtually all domestic duties considered the job of women, finding time to4 This figure excludes recordings made of large groups, such as the Subira ElimPentekoste Adult Choir of Endabeg, the Yerotoni Cultural Group, or the Group at Ayá
Manangu on 09/10/2015, during which it was deemed impractical (or simply
impossible) to collect information on each individual present. In terms of permission,
informed consent for group recordings was sought from group leaders (such as the
choir conductor for the church choir) or heads of a household (e.g. Manangu Qamsilo for
the recording made at his home). If the group was an established entity (such as the
Yerotoni Cultural Group), remuneration was made in the form of a donation to the
group. If the group was less established (such as the group at Ayá Manangu), a suitable
remuneration was discussed with the owner of the household (in that particular case,
remuneration was in the form of a large crate of soda).","[57, 58, 59]"

This section will first treat left- and right- dislocation, then repetition.
Left- and right-dislocation
Left- (2.249) and right-dislocation (2.250) are both commonly employed special
constituent orders. Pragmatically, dislocated elements are focused. Left-dislocation
is not fronting, because there is a referential pronoun in the main clause.

This is clearly important for the scope of the present work: if it claims to treat
‘the noun’, then there must be some reason why the stem, suffix, and linker are
considered part of the noun, whereas forms such as demonstratives (such as =qá’
and =ós) as well as the topic and question morphology (e.g. =oo and ~ˆ~) are not.
To this end, this section explores wordhood in Gorwaa, arriving at a cluster of
criteria which hold within a word, but do not hold elsewhere. As such, the
primary evidence for considering the -aa of daawaa (4.8)e) a part of the noun,
and the -roô of daawaroô (4.8)f) as not part of the noun is that certain relations
hold between daaw- and -aa that do not hold between daawaa and -roô. These
relations differ between languages (c.f. Haspelmath 2011), but four which are
commonly cited (and for which there is sufficient data in Gorwaa) are
orthographic boundaries, potential pause, phonetic boundaries, and
indivisibility. Each of these criteria will be examined in turn below, and
evaluated to determine their usefulness for identifying words.","[218, 219]"

sel < √ > ; NThis chapter addresses those patterns of Gorwaa suffixes which are ‘listed’:
requiring recourse to more detailed explanations of realization rules postSpellout (i.e. material from List 2 and List 3). Embick (2003) notes that “[a]ll
approaches to grammar must assume that some information is simply listed”
(144). Essentially, in English, the difference in grammaticality between two men
and *two man can be explained by recourse to the same sort of syntactic
structures as discussed in Chapter 5. However, the difference in grammaticality
between men and *mans is of a different nature. That is, it is not the expression3386. The suffix 2: the listed phenomena
of number value [plural] on the noun which is illicit (as men is a valid plural
form), but rather the manner in which it is expressed for this particular noun.
Whereas singular-plural pairs such as ban | bans, can | cans, fan | fans are licit,
man | mans is not. The man | mans error is not one of feature bundles being
manipulated by syntactic operations (ban | bans illustrates that such a
configuration is syntactically licit), rather, it is an error of how that structured set
of feature bundles comes to be realized for that particular form. In order to
recognize the ungrammaticality of man | *mans, and the grammaticality of man |
men, one must simply know that this is the way this particular word works.
Knowledge is not of the syntax, but of the particular lexical item: it is listed.
Embick goes on to state that “[h]ow this information is listed, and whether or not
listedness correlates with grammatical phenomena in a systematic fashion, is a
significant research question” (2003: 144).","[338, 339]"

"2.6.1.1 Use of demonstratives and indefinites
Perhaps the most common markers of pragmatic status are the series of
demonstratives – suffixes which attach to nouns, or independent pronouns. For
more comment on the forms of demonstrative determiners, see §2.4.1.2. For more
on demonstrative pronouns, see §2.4.3.1. Pragmatically, these forms are often used
to give nouns a definite reading.

In addition to the demonstrative determiners, which give nouns a definite reading,
there is also an indefinite suffix, which renders the noun in question not-yetidentified (2.243). For more on the forms of the indefinite determiner, see §2.4.1.3.",[178]

132,748The total yielded by this exercise is 132,748. This number represents, to the best
of my knowledge, the total possible number of Gorwaa speakers. A more
nuanced figure can be arrived at by adding up only those areas which I believe
Gorwaa to be actively spoken and used in everyday life (shaded above): this
yields a total of 79,751. These two numbers would suggest that, taken together,
60% of Gorwaa speakers are using Gorwaa actively. The remaining 40% may
391. Introduction
know Gorwaa, but are probably not using it extensively, nor passing it on to their
children.
1.2.3.2 Language use
Further tentative generalizations may be reached from personal observation.
Based on interactions observed among Gorwaa families, the language falls
somewhere between 6b and 7 on the Expanded Graded Intergenerational
Disruption Scale (EGIDS) (Lewis and Simons 2010). EGIDS Level 6b describes a
threatened language status: one in which the language is not being passed onto
children reliably enough for numbers of speakers to remain stable into the
coming generations. As time goes on, “there will be fewer speakers or fewer
domains of use or both” (13). EGIDS Level 7 describes a shifting language status:
a situation in which the language is clearly not being passed on to younger
generations.
In Babati Town, parents of Gorwaa families commonly understand Gorwaa, and
may use Gorwaa among themselves in the home. Children, however, either
understand Gorwaa but do not use it, or may only know basic items such as
greetings and how to form questions. Either way, it is rare to observe Gorwaa
children using Gorwaa, even in the home. The language used outside the home,
in virtually all interactions, is Swahili. Barring a further, more nuanced,
examination of language use among Gorwaa people in this urban setting, Gorwaa
may be assessed as 7 (shifting) in Babati Town.
More rural areas (Babati District) see more robust use among all generations,
even the youngest, but the domains in which Gorwaa is used are increasingly401. Introduction
restricted. Virtually all speakers of Gorwaa also speak Swahili (see Appendix A),
and it is considerably more common to hear Swahili being spoken in social
spaces (at the shop, at worship, etc.) than Gorwaa. Public life (see Muzale and
Rugemalira 2008) is dominated by Swahili: school, healthcare, and most all
interactions with government officials of every level is conducted in Swahili. In
the home and among neighbours, Gorwaa may still be heard, but code-switching
is ubiquitous2. Rapid societal change (introduction of new farming methods and
technology, arrival of electricity, cash-based trade, mobile phones, computers,
etc.) brings with it entirely new semantic domains, virtually all of which are seen
as more efficient to talk about in Swahili than Gorwaa. As such, though
intergenerational transmission of Gorwaa is occurring in these rural areas, the
language is clearly losing domains, and the competence of younger speakers
must be seriously questioned. Gorwaa may therefore be assessed as 6b
(threatened) in Babati District.
Language of early schooling (roughly ages 5-13) in Tanzania is Swahili, with
English as a taught language. Later schooling (roughly ages 14-19) is in English,
with Swahili as a taught subject. Virtually no schools offer provision for local
languages (i.e. languages which are not Swahili or English), either as languages of
instruction or taught languages. Historically, literacy (in Swahili) among Gorwaa
speakers was very low, with a marked improvement in the Ujamaa period
following independence in 1961, followed by a decline following restructuring of2 Though very common in most speech situations, code-switching is relatively rare inthe corpus (though see [20151025], and [20150811c-f]). This might be explained by the
fact that those recorded knew that the research was being conducted on the Gorwaa
language, and were therefore conscious to ensure they were speaking in Gorwaa, and
not Swahili.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"
"211. IntroductionIndeed, this ‘project’ does not exist in isolation: interest in the description of the
wider South Cushitic language family is not without its scholarly tradition,
beginning with Whiteley’s (1958) A Short Description of Item Categories in Iraqw
and gaining considerable advances with the Iraqw grammars of Nordbudstad
(1988), Mous (1993), and the major historical survey of Kießling (2002). A long
list of papers may also be added to this list, including those focused on historical
reconstruction (e.g. Kießling 1998, 2004, Mous 1996, and Kießling & Mous 2003)
as well as description of specific grammatical constructions (e.g. Kießling 2007,
Mous 2004, and Mous and Qorro 2010). Specifically, this work seeks to engage
in this body of description in two ways. Primarily, by treating a South Cushitic
language which has, to present, been underrepresented in literature on the
family, this work will broaden the empirical basis upon which work about South
Cushitic is conducted. Additionally, this work aims for a different perspective on
South Cushitic, namely in taking a formal approach to questions which, to
present, have been treated from a functional stance.
The division of formal and functional approaches is not neat, and runs the risk of
being essentialist. As stated in Carnie and Harley (2003) “[t]here is very little
agreement among linguists about which particular assumptions or
methodologies mark one as a functionalist or a formalist” (1). With that said, the
identification of some common dimensions along which formalist and
functionalist approaches differ, and the keys ways in which those differences are
manifest will prove useful in orienting this work in relation to past work on
South Cushitic. The following table is based on Carnie and Harley (2003:2), itself
based on Croft (1995) and Newmeyer (1998).","[21, 22]"
"3Acknowledgements
This dissertation is a culmination of several years of focused work, and arguably a
lifetime of more general ‘formation’, of which I am duly gratified, and for which I am
deeply grateful. With that said, throughout my life and work, I have consistently
benefitted from my sex, the colour of my skin, and the country of my birth. My
privilege (male, white, Western) is not acceptable. This inequality is thrown into
even sharper relief in that much of my work is based on the African continent, and is
inextricably linked with African people -- both of which still face the dark impact of
colonialism perhaps more directly than any other place on earth. As an academic,
much of whose work has been in the assignment of meaning, there is a role for me to
play in addressing these inequities. In an inaugural speech to the National
Assembly, the first president of Tanzania, Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere said “Of all the
crimes of colonialism there is none worse than the attempt to make us believe we
had no indigenous culture of our own; or that what we did have was worthless something of which we should be ashamed, instead of a source of pride.”1 It
therefore follows that, corresponding to my professional capacity and technical
ability, my work ought to help affirm what has for so long been denied: the
complexity of African language/s, the depth of African history/ies, and the richness
of African culture/s. Ultimately, of course, the role of linguist comes second to the
role of human being. As much as successful linguistics is about formulating the
perfect elicitation questions, finding the ideal consultants, and keeping tabs on the1 “President’s Inaugural Address” in Julius K. Nyerere, Freedom and Unity: A selection fromWritings and Speeches 1952-1962. (Dar es Salaam, OUP, 1966): 186-187.","[3, 4]"

the residents of the fields of Ayasanda in the process.
Dr. Kathryn Ranhorn helped me to look at Gorwaaland as part of a larger Rift Valley
area, and my work as part of a larger humanist picture.
At the University of Dar es Salaam, my thanks, as always, to my Masters-level
supervisor and current host Dr. Henry Muzale, as well as Dr. Josephat Rugemalira,
who first suggested I work on Gorwaa -- both formidable minds who never allowed
me to forget the primacy of the empirical data above the appeal of a convenient
theory.
At the school of Oriental and African Studies, my thanks to Dr. Martin Orwin and Dr.
Peter Austin, my second and third supervisors, respectively. As for Dr. Lutz Marten,
my first supervisor whose magnanimity, franchise, and patience (derived, it must be
remembered, from the Latin ‘to suffer’) I doubt I shall ever properly repay, I know of
few other people who would make a trip to Kilimanjaro to check in with how their
student is doing -- fewer still who could cut through the complexities of a language
like Gorwaa to determine those fundamental questions that I so badly needed to be
asked.
Thanks are due to the staff at the Endangered Languages Archive, who helped me
turn my data into information, available to virtually anyone, free of charge. The
ability of readers to resolve the Gorwaa material back to the original utterances is a
central feature of this dissertation, and simply would not have been possible7without their expertise in metadata, data management, and the vicissitudes of
technology.
Dr. Soung-U Kim, who read virtually the entire first draft and responded with deeply
useful comments, and Samantha Goodchild, who provided commentary on parts of
the introduction, gave vital alternate viewpoints on organization and content: a
resuscitating breath for an author in a post-draft stupor.
Dr. Hannah Gibson and Dr. Rozenn Guerois, life of the party that was Bantu group,
have been, in academic terms, the older sisters that I never had, and despite both of
their frenetic schedules, neither have ever found themselves too busy to offer
support or guidance. The friendship, hospitality, and help provided by the
remainder of the Bantu group and other hangers-on (as myself), including Dr. Peter
Edelsten, Chiku Lijongwa, Dr. Nancy Kula, Dr. Sheena Shah, and Elisabeth Kerr,
won’t soon be forgotten.
Sections of this dissertation have been presented in various forms at the Aldrich
Interdisciplinary Conference in St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada, March 2014; the
SOAS Linguistics Student Research Conference in London, UK, June 2016; the CELC
Postgraduate Workshop, Cambridge, UK, July 2016; CALL 46 in Leiden, the
Netherlands, August 2016; NACAL 45 in Leiden, the Netherlands, June 2017; CALL
47 in Leiden, the Netherlands, August 2017; and the LAGB Meeting in Canterbury,
UK, September 2017. My thanks to the audience members and individuals who
provided detailed feedback. My thanks also to Dr. Jason Merchant, Dr. David Adger,8and Dr. Hagit Borer, each of whom took the time to provide some feedback on
specific parts of the formal analysis.
To Jan and the English countryside, the easy companionship of whom seems to
blend together, I owe many of the happiest memories of my time here.
My mother, father, and younger brother have always believed in the value of my
work, and in my ability to do it. During times when I questioned myself, this proved
the single most valuable kind of support. Thank you.
Needless to say, all errors found in this dissertation are mine, and mine alone.

1.1 Why Gorwaa? Why the noun? Why formalism? A note on motivations.
Gorwaa (ISO 639-3: gow), a South Cushitic language spoken in north-central
Tanzania, is an endangered language, about which very little is known or
available to linguists. Beginning in 2012 and extending to present, I have had the
privilege of spending long periods of time living with speakers of Gorwaa in and
around what may be construed as their traditional homeland of Babati district,
conducting audiovisual documentation of their language. This work is one early
output of that documentary and descriptive fieldwork.
While learning to speak the language (an ongoing feat, it must be admitted),
perhaps one of the most mind-boggling tasks (or group of tasks) was using
nouns correctly. Simply put, as a speaker of English (with some familiarity with
both French (fra) and Swahili (swa)), I found ‘getting the nouns right’ in Gorwaa
very difficult indeed. Four examples of this characteristic difficulty are outlined
below:
TONE: Nouns must be pronounced with the appropriate tone, otherwise they are
either misunderstood or deemed incorrect. The noun aalutumo ‘inheritor ♂’
must therefore be pronounced with low tone, and the noun tlaptumó ‘falcon’
must be pronounced with high tone. Several noun pairs exist whose meaning
differs solely in whether they are produced with low or high tone. Thus, the
word for ‘drum’ is niinga, and the word for ‘pigeon species’ is niingá. The word
for ‘night’ is amsi, versus the proper name Amsí (typically given to a boy or girl
born at night).","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

1.3.3 Speech genres collected
During data collection, an attempt was made to include as diverse a range of speech
genres as possible. As such, the corpus includes materials ranging from discussions
of jural traditions (e.g. Justice 5 [20160219h]), to historical epics (e.g. History 1-A
[20151125i]), to recordings of children playing games (e.g. Usuji [20151025]).
However, only a subset of recordings from the entire corpus are referenced in the
current work. Some of the most frequently used are described below, along with
excerpted English translations.
The most uniform type of recording was those featuring elicitation, where the main
contents were translation or back-translation of phrases (1.4), or grammaticality
judgments (1.5). I hesitate to refer to these as ‘genres’, as they are most certainly
not natural speech. They do, however, feature their own norms and different types
of elicitation result in different language outputs.

Natural speech recordings produced the most diverse range of speech genres,
including narratives (e.g. Honey Stories [20131108b_20150725j]), Christian prayers
(e.g. Blessing the Meal 1 [20150725l]), and group conversations (e.g. The local
football championship [20150726d]). Among this range of genres, two which are
commonly cited in this work include personal biographies, and procedural
descriptions.

Proper nouns
Proper nouns typically refer to a unique entity (versus common nouns which
typically refer to a class of entities), as such, they cannot be modified by possessives,
nor can they be pluralized. Proper nouns may be subdivided into personal names
and place names. Each will be examined below.
Personal names
The majority of Gorwaa personal names are derived from common nouns via three
principal strategies: zero derivation (2.73), high tone insertion (2.74), and
simplification6 (2.75). Many other personal nouns are loans from other languages,
especially Datooga. As may be seen, most Gorwaa names are unisex: applicable to
both men and women. 7

Gorwaa distinguishes long vowels from short vowels. Each of the vowels above
has a short version and a long version. Orthographically, short vowels are
written with one character: a, e, i, o, u, and long vowels are written with two
characters: aa, ee, ii, oo, uu. Length distinction can be lexical, though the cases
are rare and, as in (2.2), stress may play more of a role in disambiguating the two
forms than vowel quality itself. Grammatically, however, the functional load of
vowel-length distinction is high (2.3).

Kießling (2004), establishes that across South Cushitic there are two
predominant phonemic tone contours, which operate within phonological words
including the subject noun, as well as the vP. He names these accent 1 “neutral
tone” (herein level pitch accent), and accent 2 “marked tone” (herein rising pitch
accent). However, there exist a further three intonational tone contours, used
primarily for pragmatic purposes. This therefore requires a slight expansion to
his description.
762. A grammatical sketch of Gorwaa
The two ‘grammatical’ contours described by Kießling (2004), and which bear
the largest functional loads by far, are level pitch accent (LPA), in which default
low tone is assigned to all syllables of a domain, and rising pitch accent (RPA), in
which prominent high tone is manifested on the final syllable of the phonological
word. Nouns may possess LPA or RPA lexically. In addition to this, these two
tone contours play an important role in many morphosyntactic distinctions,
including TAM, adjectival concord, and derivational operations1.

iii) [Ɂaga gú:Ɂ]

‘he slept’Additionally, there are three intonational tone contours which serve a largely
pragmatic function. The first of these, vocative pitch accent (VPA), assigns high
tone to the penultimate syllable, followed by low tone on the final syllable.
Vocative is typically used when addressing someone2. Falling pitch accent (FPA)
assigns prominent low pitch to the final syllable of the phonological word.
Falling pitch accent is used as an emphatic or contrastive device. Rising-falling
pitch accent (RFPA), features what Mous (1993:287) describes as “an extra high
tone and a subsequent fall”, and is situated on the penultimate syllable. Risingfalling pitch accent signals a polar question. These three ‘intonational tone
1 Accent marks are used in these examples to indicate tone assigned to the syllable. Lackof accent indicates low tone. An acute accent (´) indicates high tone. A grave accent (`)
indicates extra low tone. A circumflex accent (ˆ) indicates rising-falling tone.
2 Gorwaa personal names are uniformly polysyllabic – in addition to contextual clues,
the possibility of confusion between a hypothetical monosyllable in RPA versus one in
VPA is very slim indeed.","[75, 76, 77]"
"Prohibitive Prefix mThe prohibitive prefix m- (Mous 1993: 151-152) is used in two primary ways. First,
it is employed with the two negative imperative suffixes (-aar, and -ara’) to
complete a negative imperative construction (2.190). Second, it is employed with
the background suffix (-wa) to express negative commands for all persons other
than 2nd (which are covered by the imperative forms) (2.191).

"Both Acquaviva (2008) and Harley (2014) argue convincingly that such root
diacritics do not exist, but in so doing, provide no alternate explanation for how
paradigms are associated with given noun stems. This is acknowledged in
Acquaviva (2008), which concludes that:
“The approach I have outlined [...] does not provide a formal
expression of the stable association of most roots with gender, class,
or other diacritics. This seems to be a weakness, in so far as a noun’s
idiosyncratic marking should have a formal grammatical encoding.”
p.16
This section has adopted the argument that paradigms cannot be encoded as
diacritics on the lexical root, and has accepted this argument’s associated cost: that
no good alternative to encoding paradigms has so far been offered. The following
subsection proposes a solution consistent with the Gorwaa data, and details how
this is borne out both pre- and post-Spellout.",[369]

the economy to a capitalist model, which began in 1986. Today, while many
Gorwaa speaking children do attend school, education may be disrupted or not
completed depending on the economic fortunes of the family. Illiteracy among
young adults is not uncommon. Literate Gorwaa speakers will be literate in
Swahili (which employs the Roman alphabet), and possibly English.
In 1977, an Iraqw translation of the Old Testament was produced by the
Tanzania Bible Society which employed a writing system developed principally
by the Catholic mission at Tlawi. As an appendix, a glossary of Gorwaa terms
were included in order to make the book useable by the Gorwaa speaking
Christian community as well. Though the book (nor Gorwaa-language worship)
never became particularly widespread, it did establish the Iraqw writing system
as the standard for Gorwaa as well. With that said, a great diversity of nonstandard writing conventions are in use (e.g. [20150815m], [20150920n],
[20151001z], [20151127g], and [20151127h]), and the language is not very
commonly seen in written form.
In addition to the Gorwaa of everyday interaction, several specific genres of
Gorwaa also exist. Though these have not been given enough attention so as to
be discussed in any great detail, they will briefly mentioned below.
Riddles, a common way of passing the time following the evening meal and
before bed, are often based on guessing the identity of a cryptic description. A
teller will pose their riddle, and others will provide a guess. If nobody guesses
correctly, the riddle either goes unanswered, or may be ‘bought’ from the teller421. Introduction
by offering a village, town, or city (I once observed a particularly good riddle sell
in exchange for all of Canada).

[20130206b_20150720b.3-7]
My calabash is small,
It has two mouths,
And has much oil that never runs out.
[Answer: the nose]
Another speech genre is the firoo: a litany-like pronouncement, usually asking
for the intercession of the indigenous god Loo’aa. The contents of the firoo
seems relatively variable, and I have yet to observe the more formulaic slufay as
described for Iraqw (Thornton 1977, Wada 1978, Kamera 1987/1988, Beck &
Mous 2014).
As a genre, Gorwaa song represents a diverse array of material, often associated
with particular events or occasions. Wedding songs (e.g. [20160229n]), dancing
songs (e.g. [20160120h]), songs of praise and songs of victory (e.g. [20151004f]),
farming songs (e.g. [20150903f]), and circumcision songs (e.g. [20151202a]) are
all examples which have been recorded. Certain songs are typically only sung by
men, such as some of the Mandaa songs (e.g. [20160927c]), and certain songs are
typically only sung by women (e.g. [20160225t]).

may also be wholly different. Typical themes include highly poetic entreaties to
lovers, descriptions of parties and their attendees, as well as historical events.
Songs are often performed unaccompanied, but may also be sung along with431. Introduction
music from the seense (lute/guitar, see e.g. [20160127o], [20160217o],
[20160217zc]), irimba (mbira, thumb piano, see e.g. [20160210j], [20160217d],

[20161113f], [20160217ze]), and the niinga (drum, see e.g. [20151004d],
[20151001w]). To date, over 250 recordings of Gorwaa songs have been made.
The mystical monologues (or perhaps dialogues) into which traditional doctors
enter during the performance of various rites represent another genre of speech.
Due to the secretive nature of this type of speech, the only recorded examples
are that of the diviner reading stones in order to determine a client’s prospects
(e.g. [20151003d-e], [20151211c-e]). Cursory examination shows these sessions
are highly structured, and feature specialized vocabulary.
1.2.3.3 Language attitudes
As with language use, no dedicated survey of language attitudes has been
undertaken for Gorwaa, and as such, the generalizations made here are tentative.
Overall, there appears to be a rather sharp divide in language attitudes,
particularly in terms of age, as well as identification with a rural versus urban
way of life. Typically, older Gorwaa speakers from rural areas tend to be most
enthusiastic about their language, seeing it as useful in the widest range of
domains, and valuable as a badge of a culture with which they strongly identify.
Younger Gorwaa speakers in more urban areas tend to view Gorwaa as being
less useful in day-to-day life, and, in some cases, tend to be somewhat
embarrassed to be heard speaking Gorwaa, especially when non-Gorwaa
speakers are present. A large proportion of younger speakers have gone so far441. Introduction
as to eliminate the concept of Gorwaa altogether, in favour of the exonym
‘Mbulu’. Mbulu, name of the largest Iraqw settlement, has recently emerged to
subsume both the Iraqw and the Gorwaa peoples, cultures, and languages, and is
perhaps the most common way for both Gorwaa and Iraqw youth to refer to
themselves. Resultantly, many young Gorwaa speakers typically refer to
themselves as of Mbulu ethnicity, and to the language which they speak as Mbulu
or Kimbulu. Superficially, this simply represents the adoption of a new title, as
the language which speakers use remains the same. In the longer-term this
perhaps represents a larger shift to Iraqw, as the Gorwaa are most certainly the
minority within this neo-ethnicity.
With that said, there has been considerable interest from Gorwaa speakers of all
ages in the work surrounding the current Gorwaa language documentation, with
the contribution of some (considerably elderly) consultants resulting in a large
body of data (such as songs, traditional justice, and uncommon or archaic
vocabulary) being collected in a relatively short period of time. Younger
speakers directly involved in the translation and transcription of the material
have become researchers in their own right, and are taking increasing ownership
of the project, and ultimately the documentation and description of their own
culture. Such energy would seem to suggest that those exposed to the full
richness of the language tend to approach it with new esteem, and may be a
route to explore should the speaker community ever desire to further valorize
Gorwaa.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

"3.2 A model of syntax
Distributed morphology is ‘distributed’ because there exists no single repository
for words, their meanings, and their pronunciations in the grammar. Rather,
these functions are spread (distributed) throughout different parts of the
grammar. It is the syntax, broadly construed, which ties these different parts
together, allowing abstract bundles of structural primitives to receive both1923. The theoretical framework
pronunciation and meaning. Because of the central role the syntax plays in this
system, it is here where our introduction to DM will begin.
There exist a great range of frameworks available to linguists wishing to both
represent syntactic structure, as well as conduct syntactic analysis, many of
which have produced interesting and useful insight on empirical data. The
framework chosen in this work is Minimalism. This is, to some degree, a choice
of convenience: it is the framework with which the author is most familiar. More
pertinently, it is largely within this tradition of Generative Phrase Structure
Grammars (e.g. Chomsky 1995) that DM was conceived. As such, Minimalism
and DM are largely compatible.","[192, 193]"

probably not use an
encapsulated form to do
so (see §7.3.3.1, esp.
(7.20); c.f. Baker (1996:

As may be seen, in certain cases (such as adjectival number agreement), the
analyses yielded by the new formal approach are virtually the same as those
yielded by the former functional approach. In other cases (such as
encapsulation), the analysis frames the phenomenon in a different way. In still
other cases (tonal pairs, linkers), the two approaches lead to two final analyses251. Introduction
so different that they will surely result in visible differences in, say, glossing for a
descriptive grammar of the language. What ought to be noted is that, though
each pair of analyses uses a very different approach and, occasionally, arrives at
a very different interpretation of the phenomenon, no single one yields an
‘answer’. Ultimately, each of these interpretations will have their use in the
description of the language and, when taken together, represent a richer view of
the phenomena at hand. It is in this spirit of complementarity that the current
work adopts a formal approach, and it is hoped that the insight derived from it
will stimulate future thought and inquiry.
Specifically, the theory which informs the formal approach taken in this work is
Distributed Morphology (DM) (Halle & Marantz 1993, 1994). Because much of
what follows treats the noun as a complex of smaller parts, DM seemed the most
obvious framework to follow. Because DM asserts that sub-word components
(i.e. morphemes) enter into structural relationships according to the same
mechanisms which drive the structuring of phrases and clauses, the same vision
of the syntax (i.e. Minimalism) may be adopted at all levels throughout the work.
The remainder of this chapter situates the Gorwaa language within its larger
social and historical context, and provides details on the methods and
methodology used to collect the data used herein.
Following this introduction is a general sketch of Gorwaa. Providing a general
introduction to the language, this chapter is intended as both an empirical
contribution to a language for which no previous description was available, as261. Introduction
well as to ground the reader in some basic concepts which will be further
elaborated in following chapters.
The third chapter is an introduction to the formal model employed in the
linguistic analysis: the Minimalist Programme and Distributed Morphology.
The fourth chapter discusses the core subject matter of the work: the noun.
Following some discussion on wordhood criteria, the noun is established as
composed of three major parts: the stem, the suffix, and the linker. The
remainder of the chapter provides a formal DM analysis of the Gorwaa noun
stem.
The fifth chapter turns to the suffix. Morphosyntactically complex, suffixes are
identified as having phenomena which may be described as regular as well as
phenomena which may be described as listed. This chapter treats the former
characteristics, and the following chapter treats the latter. With this established,
an overview of the regular phenomena ensues, as well as a detailed presentation
of the suffixes of Gorwaa. From a formal (DM) perspective, these regular
characteristics are accounted for as products of feature bundles being
manipulated in the syntax.
The sixth chapter treats the listed phenomena of the suffix. Following an
introduction to the idea of declension class (or paradigm), an overview of the
listed phenomena is given, as well as a detailed presentation of the paradigms
into which noun suffixes enter in Gorwaa. Formally, these listed phenomena are
accounted for as realizations of rules post-Spellout.","[24, 25, 26, 27]"

Noun to verb
The two denominal suffixes identified in Mous (1993) for Iraqw have also been
identified for Gorwaa. The factitive –uus and the middle –uut are each presented
below.
Factitive
Though this morpheme -uus appears related in form to the causative morpheme,
Mous (1993: 189) makes the point of not referring to this form as causative ‘because
the derived verb need not have the causative meaning and can be intransitive’. As
such, it is therein referred to as factitive. The evidence is the same in Gorwaa, and
the terminology will therefore be adopted.","[120, 121]"
"The specific suffixes featured in a given paradigm will be referred to as its
content. As mentioned above, the content of the paradigm into which the noun
stem kook- enters is -(a)mó (Mo) and -ama’ (N∅). Among the three criteria of
content, shape, and texture, the criterion of content is most salient to the identity
of the paradigm. For example, the noun stem ga/at- takes the suffixes -imi (Fr)
and -náy (Mo), forming ga/atimi ‘high fever’ and ga/atanáy ‘high fevers’,
respectively. This paradigm -imi (Fr) | -náy (Mo) has both the same shape (i.e. a
pair) and the same texture (i.e. Sg. | Pl.) as the paradigm into which kook- enters
above, but is different because of its content.",[344]

"2.3.5.3 Relative iconicity
The final, perhaps most abstract form of iconicity is known as relative iconicity, is a
relational form of depiction where related words map related meanings, some
possible examples from Gorwaa include: words beginning in [ts], which seem to
evoke entities that are wet, cold, or far away (tseere ‘blood’, tsiinqa ‘stream’, tsá’
‘cold’, tsee/a ‘faraway place’, tsetse/ ‘stars’, BUT: tsee/amá ‘sunshine’); words
beginning in [hh] evoke entities related to the windpipe or respiration: (hhartsi ‘air’,
hheehhá ‘gullet’, hhumpu ‘lungs’); words containing the vowel [i] + [hh] evoke sharp
entities or events involving sharp entities: (sihhina ‘tooth’, kiíhh ‘bite’, diíhh ‘sharp’).
It must be noted that this last type of iconicity is very hard to nail down indeed –
and all classes here must be posited as provisional.",[132]
"3426. The suffix 2: the listed phenomena
“Just as atoms are the building blocks of matter, bonding in various
fashions to form complex molecules, the noun class prefixes
combine to form paradigms. Stretching the metaphor a little
further, it is of little explanatory value if one tries to explain the
properties of matter, to know that a substance contains for
example hydrogen and carbon atoms ‒ an information [sic] that
pertains to thousands of substances with widely differing
properties ‒ without knowing which kind of bonds and molecules
are formed by these atoms.”
p.111
6.3 Overview of the listed phenomena
This section expands on each of the listed phenomena associated with the
Gorwaa suffix. These are repeated in (6.4) below.
(6.4) THE LISTED MORPHOSYNTACTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GORWAA SUFFIX
a.
A given noun stem takes a set of suffixes, known as a paradigm.
Paradigms may occur in three different shapes: monads, pairs, or triads.
Paradigms may be composed of different types of suffixes.
b.
The paradigm taken by any given noun stem is unpredictable.
c.
A given noun stem may have more than one paradigm. Selection of
paradigm may or may not affect the semantic interpretation of the resultant noun.
d.
Suffixes unvalued for number may have the kinds of agreement with
which they may occur restricted by the shape and composition of their paradigm.
e.
The grammatical gender (i.e. M, F, or N) of a noun is determined by
the SFX2 morpheme, which has a stable association with gender. If a noun is
changed for number, its gender may also change.
Each characteristic will be discussed in its own subsection below. Subsection
6.2.1 treats characteristic (a): the paradigm: content, shape, and texture.
Subsection 6.2.2 treats characteristic (b): the unpredictability of the paradigm.
Subsection 6.2.3 treats characteristic (c): multiple paradigms for a given stem.
Subsection 6.2.4 treats characteristic (d): paradigmatic effects on number value.
Subsection 6.2.5 treats characteristic (e): gender ‘polarity’.","[342, 343]"
"6.5 Analysis
Following the data presentation above, Gorwaa nominal suffixes can be described as
entering into at least 178 different paradigms: 151 pairs, 20 monads, and 7 triads.
The paradigm taken by any given noun stem is unpredictable. A given noun stem
may have more than one paradigm: choice between which paradigm the stem takes
may or may not affect semantic interpretation of the resultant noun. Suffixes of
general number may have the kinds of agreement with which they may occur
restricted based on the shape and texture of their paradigm. Finally, the
grammatical gender of a noun is determined by the SFX2 morpheme. As such, if a
noun is changed for number value, its gender may also change.",[364]
"The second goal of this work was to provide an analysis of noun morphosyntax. In
contrast with functional accounts in South Cushitic, this thesis attempted a formal
analysis, adopting the Distributed Morphology architecture, and Minimalism. By
adopting this framework, it was shown that the Gorwaa noun is itself a complex of
several subparts, the structure of which is dictated by the same rules applied to
larger phrases. The resultant structure, and the relations which hold within its
subparts, provides a ready account of many of the peculiarities of the Gorwaa noun
described in the data presentations.",[435]

2.4.1.3 Indefinite determiners
Indefinite determiners occur as suffixes to their head noun, and inflect for its
gender. The form for the masculine and neuter is -ko, and the form for the feminine
is -ka. The head noun occurs in long-form. Indefinite determiners are glossed Indef,
along with the gender of their head. Indefinites cannot occur with pronominal
heads, as pronouns in Gorwaa are inherently definite.
