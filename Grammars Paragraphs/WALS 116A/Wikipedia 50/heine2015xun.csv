"248The !Xun languageEl8.2.2 Word questions
Like sentence questions, word questions require the presence of a question particle (see section 8.2 above); under certain conditions, however, the particle can be omitted (see Snyman1970: 196 for E1).
In a number of NW-!Xun dialects there occurs a fossilized nasal prefix *m- (occasionally
*n- before alveolar consonants) in question words; for examples, see below. This prefix is
also retained before verbs in some ritualized expressions, such as the greeting formula in thenléréarea-W2a428SG_Qn-te’a.ahan,mimé_tea.sleepyeslsGTOP _sleep‘Yes, I slept.’ (early morning greeting)‘Did you sleep?’Interrogative attribute ‘which?’

Treatment of interpersonal functions in this chapter is restricted to two domains, namely that
of commands(8.1) and that of questions (8.2), and the final section 8.3 is devoted to two sa-lient discourse pragmatic functions.","[122, 123]"
"The context
A survey of all dialects in which variation of pronominal forms has been observed suggests
that there are five kinds of syntactic functions or, as we will say here, contexts that are in
some way relevant for our analysis, namely the following:
Interpersonal subject (1S): With this label we refer to uses of personal pronouns in subjecfunction of utterances marked for interpersonal distinctions such as questions or deontic m
dality (obligation, necessity, etc.), e.g.,4hijtcé?",[160]
"NlTOPPASTbeat| Human referents (PL)
(i) Referents of N3
(ii) Animals (and a few human nouns)
(i) Referent(s) of N1
(ii) Human referent (SG)
(i) Inanimate referent(s)
(ii) Referents of N43PL‘He beat them.’While the division between semantic and gender agreement differs slightly from one dialect to another, the situation found in W2 is not untypical of the NW-dialects in general.” Theexamples above show the following for W2: if there is a human singular referent then the
noun class 1 marker Ad is used. If there is a human plural referent then the plural pronoun of(< *sij) is used, and if the referent is a plural non-human animate (including a few human
concepts) then the noun class 3 marker yif is (< *yi). Otherwise, agreement is in accordance
with noun class membership.
We observed in section 4.2.1 that Proto-!Xun must have distinguished the following 8”ders:GenderNumberN3transnumeral
transnumeralinanimate concepts. In the N2 dialect as well, *sij was replaced by the noun class markers *se(> si) and *yi (> 2). In all other dialects again, *sij was retained, even if it competes with the
noun class markers, namely class N2 in the W1 dialect (*se > sé) and class N3 in the W3 dia-lect (*yi > yit).’
10.3 ConclusionsThere remain a number of questions that we were not able to deal with in this chapter, in particular the following: (a) What are the ultimate motivations to develop new forms of personal
pronouns? (b) Why did these speakers do so despite the fact that they already disposed of a
full-fledged set of pronouns? (c) Why are certain forms but not others abandoned in the presence of new pronouns? (d) And finally, why are some dialects, NW-!Xun in particular, intheir treatment of pronominal forms more innovative than other dialects, such as the SE-!Xundialects, while SE-!Xun turns out to be more innovative in other domains of grammar, as we
will see in section 11.2? Unfortunately, there are not enough data to answer these questions.
Nevertheless, we hope to have presented at least a few insights into the dynamics of dialect
development via diachronic reconstruction — insights that are meant to provide a better underStanding of why the systems of personal pronouns are structured the way they are. One ques-tion that concerned us in this chapter was how the various dialects came to develop such a
Wealth of different pronominal forms. We saw that these forms did not all appear at the same
me; rather some can be traced back to the ancestral language of all !Xun dialects, others
afose around or after the first split of the language, and still others, such as *ba (2SG) and *ya
(2PL) of the W1 and W2 dialects, must be of fairly recent origin.",[163]

A sentence consists minimally of a verb; the verb therefore forms the core of an utterance.
Ignoring question words, adverbs and auxiliary elements that may also appear in the verbphrase, the order of main constituents is as summarized in table 3-1. With the exception of the
verb stem (and in W2 and E3 the topic marker), none of these constituents is obligatory. Theverb stem may be extended either by the transitive suffix *-a (section 3.5) or by derivational
extensions (section 6.2.2).

Ouns have the following properties: (a) They form the head of noun phrases, (b) they are inntly marked for gender, and (c) they determine the gender and number behaviour of de: dent categories. There is no grammaticalized way of marking definiteness or indefinite-Bess in any of the dialects (see section 4.1.3).
Many nouns are what Kahler (1973: 26) calls “bivalent” in E2, that is, they have both nomand verbal uses. This appears to be due to the presence of a fairly productive conversionpattern whereby verbs can function as nouns without involving any formal means, e.g.,(a) ‘eat’, (b) ‘food’nd‘For food he came.’The sequence g/é /a’a is suggestive of the SVC in that there appears to be a canonical combination of two verbs, g/é ‘come’ and /a’a ‘give’.

the basis of the meaning of the utterance, which suggests that g/é is the main verb; according

this example suggests that it is not a coverb but a derivational extension since /a’a as an
verb typically introduces benefactive participants, while in the present example, where It

troduces an inanimate participant, it has a purpose function, which is a more strongly
maticalized use typically associated with /a’a as derivational marker (see section 6.2.2). Note

Finally, there is a use pattern where md collocates with the question particle ré to form an

"314The !Xun languageforms that we claim to be innovations are restricted to certain groups of dialects, hence there
is reason to assume that they arose within these dialects after the split-up of Proto-!Xun,
There are, however, two cases, concerning the first person singular pronoun “na and the third
person plural form *se, which seemingly pose a problem to this hypothesis; we will return to
this issue below.
That context is a factor that can be helpful in reconstructing earlier language states is suggested by the following: our reconstruction of the paradigm of the eight pronouns listed above
would seem to rest on firm grounds. Accordingly, contexts in which they occur today are likely to be the contexts in which they were also used in Proto-!Kun. Conversely, contexts where
they are not found and where instead the presumed innovated forms occur are suggestive of
being the result of later developments. We thus argue that the kinds of contexts that we distinguished in the preceding section 10.1 can be divided into two main types, namely conservative and innovative contexts.
Wherever we have sufficient information, it turns out that throughout all dialects it is theuse as object pronouns (0) and as NP-constituent (NP) where the inherited forms are found; we
therefore argue that these are the (most) conservative contexts for first and second person pronouns (see tables 10-2 through 10-5). And whenever the inherited pronouns are not found in
all contexts, then this is in interpersonally marked utterances (IS) and as non-topical subject
(NS). These are exactly the kinds of context where the presumed innovated forms occur
throughout the dialects. Accordingly, we claim that IS and NS are the innovative contexts.
But there remain a number of questions. One concerns the topical subject (TS) context: why
do both inherited and innovated forms occur in this context? A comprehensive answer would
require a detailed discourse-pragmatic analysis, which we are not able to carry out here; nev-315The dynamics of dialect developmentfact that in W3, which is spoken in the same general area as C1, *n@ appears to have ousted#ma. Thus, the latter two dialects, belonging to different branches of !Xun, exhibit the same
forms of first person pronouns.
Neither *ma nor *na were extended beyond the IS, NS, and TS contexts in any of the dia-lects, and in W2 *ma has not even been fully accepted as a topical subject pronoun up to now
(see table 10-2). At the same time did the spread of these new pronouns apparently lead to the
loss of the old pronoun *mi in IS and Ns function, in the N2 and C1 dialects also to the loss of
*mf as a topical subject pronoun. In the latter two dialects there is thus a clear distinction in
that *ma and *na, respectively, are the general subject pronouns and *mi is used elsewhere,
that is, in the conservative contexts as an object pronoun and as a possessive modifier.
Since both of the innovated forms *ma and “na have been retained in W1 and K, the
Kavango dialect, these two dialects dispose of three different forms of a first person pronoun.’Second person singular
All dialects show a diachronically stable situation: they all have retained the Proto-!Xun pronoun *a in all contexts. There is only one locally restricted innovation: in the closely related
and neighbouring W1 and W2 dialects, a second pronoun *ba was introduced? but, like *ma
and *na, its use did not spread to the conservative contexts O and NP, which remained re-served for *4. Considering its geographical and genetic restriction and the fact that *ba had no
Noticeable effect on the use of the inherited pronoun, there is reason to assume that its intro-duction is of recent origin.straightfor-Third person singular pronoun
From the time of Proto-!Xun there has been only one third person singular pronoun, *ha. But
*ha is, and presumably always was, restricted to human referents, to some extent also to non-ward answer: the TS context is located at the intersection between conservative and innovativehuman animates. Beyond any reasonable doubt, *ha was the marker of the human noun classertheless, on the basis of the observations made above there would seem to be acontexts, hence it tends to combine features of both contexts, exhibiting an overlapping be-haviour. Another question relates to the differential distribution of pronominal forms: why are
singular forms, except for *A, restricted to one type of context while plural pronouns occur in
all contexts? While we are not able to explain this discrepancy, we will volunteer a partial answer below.
The overall hypothesis that we propose on the development of personal pronouns in !Xun
is the following: at the stage of Proto-!Xun there was a uniform set of personal pronouns;
namely the ones listed in table 10-6. Subsequently, new forms were introduced, competing
with the inherited ones. The new forms were restricted to what we call innovative contexts;
but some spread eventually to all contexts. For the inherited forms this meant that, at the first
stage, they were used interchangeably with the new ones in the innovative contexts, but at 4
later stage some of the inherited forms gave way to the new ones in these contexts, the latter
replacing the former. In those cases where the new forms were extended to all contexts, there
now is competition between the two in all their uses, that is, two different forms of pronouns:
are used for one and the same purpose.
;
This is a highly general sketch of development; as the following survey of individual cal€gories will show, there are some interesting variations among these categories.
First person singular
forIn addition to the inherited pronoun *mi there are two further forms, *ma and *na. 3 The
mer is restricted to NW-!Xun and can be assumed to have arisen at the stage of Proto-NW!Xun.","[161, 162]"

Whether two vowels following one another represent vowel combinations or diphthongs is an
open question in virtually all dialects (see Heikkinen 1986 for W1). The following sequencesof two vowels that might qualify as diphthongs have been identified:
Oral:ae, ai, ao, au, ei, eu, ia, oa, oe, oi, ua, UiBreathy:
Pharyngeal:aeh, aoh, auh, eih, euh, oah, oeh, uih

P thong aen [a] has been recorded (Snyman 1970: 31) which corresponds to ay [an] or any
fan} in E2 (Kéhler 1981: 561). Diphthongs are treated by Snyman (1970: 20ff.) as ‘“juxta-a monosyllabic” vowels. Falling and level (= “horizontal”) diphthongs are written by
nyman (1970: 23) with an initial semivowel symbol, hence:

convenience as table 10-1. This table shows most of all two things: first, there is a paradigm
of etymologically fairly stable pronouns across dialects which can be traced back to Proto‘Xun. It is only in the third person plural that two other kinds of pronouns are found, namely
P-X *se (> SE-!Xun si, N2 si, W1 sé) and *yi (> W1, W2 yii, N2 i); as we saw in section
4.2.1, these are the noun class markers of classes 2 (*se, N2) and 3 (*yi, N3), respectively.
We hypothesize that the original personal pronoun was *sij and that later on the two noun
class markers were introduced to function as personal pronouns — with the effect that the two‘The hunter told me that he had killed the kudu.’ (Dickens 2005: 56)

"10.1 The diversity of personal pronouns
In section 4.1.1, table 4-1, we provided an overview of personal pronouns, reprinted here for
“convenience as table 10-1. This table shows most of all two things: first, there is a paradigm
of etymologically fairly stable pronouns across dialects which can be traced back to Proto‘Xun. It is only in the third person plural that two other kinds of pronouns are found, namely
P-X *se (> SE-!Xun si, N2 si, W1 sé) and *yi (> W1, W2 yi, N2 i); as we saw in section
4.2.1, these are the noun class markers of classes 2 (*se, N2) and 3 (*yi, N3), respectively.
We hypothesize that the original personal pronoun was *sij and that later on the two noun
class markers were introduced to function as personal pronouns — with the effect that the two
“ow co-exist side by side in W1,W2,and W3,while in N2 and the SE-!Xundialects theoriginal pronoun *sij was replaced by the noun class markers. Note that N2 is a plural noun
class while N3 has plural function with one group of nouns but is transnumeral (numberneutral) with another (see section 4.2.1). In the third person singular it is the marker of noun
class 1 (*ha, N1) that generally serves as a personal pronoun; hence we argue that at the stage
of Proto-!Xun there was no third person pronoun other than the noun class 1 marker.

and the question is why this should be so and how these competing forms are used. As we
observed in section 4.1.1, this is a complex issue. Take the following examples of the first
person singular pronoun in the W2 dialect: in (a), only mi can be used, in (b) only md can be311The dynamics of dialect developmentw2hama—ikén!!a’m tiNlTOPPASTbeatPASSkémi.","[159, 160]"

There are various definitions of topic in the literature.* We are relying here on the notionProposed by Lambrecht (1986,1994). Accordingly, we will maintain that a topic is the thingWhich an utterance (or proposition) is about; it is the element which is linked to the pragmaticPresupposition that is the part of the utterance which the speaker assumes the hearer knows ortakes for granted (Lambrecht 1994). Topic referents are therefore immediately accessible inho-4I a-kd-a?nihdannle’émiho.the discourse,Ttherekudu_onelscfindTopic elements commonly are but need not be the first element in a sentence. Still, we are
Restricted to topic constituents that are placed sentence-initially and are marked by grammatical expressions (glossed “TOP”) whose only or main function it is to signal the presence
Of a topic constituent. Take the following example from the W1 dialect:a‘I found one kudu.’
(Dickens 2005: 77)Furthermore, there appears to be an interrogative focus marker wa (Q.FOC) in E1, placedimmediately after the constituent it focalizes.? This marker can focalize any argument:Wl[Unim&oha — Ixitin.","[132, 133]"
"‘It is raining, therefore I am leaving.’ (Vedder 1910/11: 107)
The El-conjunctions, which may be used interchangeably (Dickens 2005: 64), are formed
m the same pattern but are etymologically different: /’4-kd-d-hin is composed of the referenal demonstrative /’a ‘that (referred to earlier)’, the noun ké ‘place’, the transitive suffix -a,
llus the emphatic particle hin. /’a-kd-d-hin contains the same elements except that instead of
locative noun ké there is the pronoun kd of noun class 4. The two particles thus mean
lachronically ‘it is that place (referred to earlier)’ and ‘it is that (thing, class 4)’:

"The transitive suffix and relativization
In E1, the transitive suffix is tone-enclitic, i.e. the tone of this particle is the same as the last
tone of the preceding item to which *-a is suffixed, but the situation is more complex than @
other varieties. Dickens (1997: 108ff.) actually distinguishes two markers -a- for El: one that
has low tone and serves as a relative clause marker (see section 9.2.2.3), and another whos
tone is a copy of the preceding syllable and which is used as the transitive suffix and as 4 suf
fix of compounds, marking the head of a compound (see section 6.1). But the situation is dif
ferent in E2: according to the data available it seems that the transitive suffix basically h
low tone, cf. (a), but assimilates to a preceding mid tone (b).

On the basis of the data available we hypothesize that Proto-!Xun had a transitive suffix“a whose tone was either mid or low, and whose use was later extended in Proto-SE to also
Tve as a relative clause marker. In the latter capacity, its stable tone was retained while in all
uses the suffix became a tone enclitic in SE-!Xun. This reconstruction must be taken___ vate; it is questioned by Henry Honken (p.c.), who draws attention to the different funcns of the two markers. Our main reason to derive the relative clause marker from the tran-suffix Is that both serve to introduce complements, which in the case of the former are
and in the latter nominal complements. Now, as has been established in works on
alicalization (see especially Heine & Kuteva 2007, chapter 2), markers serving to in-=. ah

the Khoisan family or phylum (see, e.g., Greenberg 1963), and there are in fact numerous lexical and grammatical forms that !Xun shares with other South African Khoisan languages.
However, it is not entirely clear whether these shared forms are due to genetic inheritance orlanguage contact, or to chance. There is therefore some justification to treat !Kun as a genetic
isolate, that is, as a language grouping for which no genetic relationship to any language
family has been established. But there is one other language that we hypothesize to be genetically related to !Xun, namely the Eastern Hoan language (henceforth in short: #Hoan), spoken by small groups of hunter-gatherers in Botswana. !Xun and +Hoan jointly form what we
propose to call the Kx’a family of languages, a term taken from the root *kx’& ‘ground, soil’
which is shared by all the linguistic communities concerned” (Honken 2004; Heine & Honken
2010).
The !Xun-speaking people are arguably the most well-known traditional hunter-gatherer
society of Africa. There is a wealth of anthropological work on all aspects of the social, cultural and economic life and the ecology of the society (see, e.g., Marshal] 1962, 1967, 1999;
Lee & DeVore 1968, 1976; Lee 1979, 1984; Wilmsen 1989; Solway & Lee 1990; Biesele
1993; see also the references in Willet 2002, 2003), and the !Xun have been the subject ofcontroversies relating more generally to human behaviour and evolution. Virtually all of this
work, however, has focused on one specific segment of the population, namely the Juhoan(si), that is, speakers of the El dialect (see table 1-1). Other than that, we still know
very little about this people (but see, e.g., Takada 2005, 2007, 2008). The approximate distrib-ution of the present !Xun-speaking area is found in map 1 (see also Brenzinger 2000), ignoring the !Xun-speaking groups that were re-settled in 1994 to Schmidtsdrift, South Africa (see
Weich 2004; Robbins 2006, 2007).
The language has come to be known under a variety of different names. The reasons for referring to both the people speaking this language and their language as !Xun ([!xii], meaning
Person, people’), rather than adopting the alternative name Ju or Jul’hoan, or Jul’hoansi that
has also been proposed (e.g., Giildemann & Vossen 2000), are given in section 1.1. There is
no reliable information on the total number of !Xun speakers; according to- our highly tenta=e estimate, there are between 10,000 and 15,000 people who speak !Xun as their first lanage.
The evidence available suggests that !Xun can be described as an L-complex, that is, as acluster of speech forms that appears to be connected by a chain of mutual intelligibility, butSpeakers at the extreme ends of the chain do not understand one another. For example, !Xun
Speakers of central Angola do not understand !Xun speakers of eastern Namibia or northwestoe
Even dialects presumed to be fairly closely interrelated are not necessarily mu-re cornea
aStill, no clear-cut language boundary separating the various !Xun varieties= momied so far. Since there is reason to believe that all the !Xun varieties that haveton,notice so far are linked by some intelligibility chain, we prefer to treat the various
S as a single, even if complex, language.","[7, 8]"
"316The !Xun language317The dynamics of dialect developmentFirst person inclusive plural pronoun
The form *m (‘we, including you’) does not appear to have undergone any noteworthy
change since the time of Proto-!Xun. None of the dialects developed any alternative form for
this pronominal concept.","[162, 163]"
"1973, 1981; Snyman 1970) use the term !Xun ([!xtiJ) in their titles. Third, out of the three
branches of the language, two (Northwestern and Central) use only !Xun as an ethnonym
(Vedder 1910/11; Doke 1925; Heikkinen1986, 1987). And fourth, in the Southeastern dialectEl, the term j/hddn-si means ‘the real, the true people’, but in the Northwestern dialects
(W1, W2), the adjective /hdan does not mean ‘real, true’ but rather ‘useless, empty’. Applying the term beyond the El dialect therefore would not be well received among speakers of
the Northwestern dialects.
The second issue is about how to refer to individual dialects. Our decision to introduce the
labels listed in table 1-1 is in some ways not really appealing. One may wonder whether reducing people and their language to letters and numbers is really politically correct — in particular since the !Xun people are among the politically, socially, and economically most marginalized populations to be found on the African continent. In the end, however, we saw no
alternative to this choice for the following reasons: first, the endonyms used by the various
groups are not of much help in discriminating between dialects; as table 1-1 shows, the name
used for self-reference is generally ‘the people’ and to their language or dialect ‘the people’s
tongue’.
Second, the existing terminology can only be described as being both complex and confusing. Not only is one and the same dialect referred to in the literature with different names
(El, for example, is called /X# by Snyman 1970 but Ju/hoan by Dickens 1994, 2005), but
also is one and the same name used for different dialects (thus, Ju/hoan is not only used forEl but frequently also for E3 and other dialects). The convention we propose has not only the
advantage over alternative ones that it allows for an unambiguous identification of all dialects,
but it also provides information about the genetic affiliation, as we will see in table 1-2.",[10]
