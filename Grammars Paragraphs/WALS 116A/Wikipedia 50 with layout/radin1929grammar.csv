     A GRAMMAR OF THE WAPPO LANGUAGE*
                                       BY
                                 PAUL RADIN
                               INTRODUCTION
    The languages of the American Indians have been studied for so
long from one definite viewpoint in America that a few words of
justification must preface any attempt, such as the following, that
deviates in many respects from the customary method. About the
merits of the approach of Boas, Goddard, Michelson, etc., no words
are necessary. To seek to describe a language in terms of its specific
structure with complete disregard, for the time being, of all historical
and genetic problems is a necessary preliminary condition for any
adequate linguistic study. No penetration into the genius of a language
is possible without it, and certainly one of the most justifiable criticisms
that can be leveled against the studies on primitive linguistics made by
many philologists and ethnologists is that they have neglected this
type of presentation and permitted themselves to be completely dom-
inated by purely genetic problems. Quite a number of philologists
 (when discussing primitive languages) have been content to accept as
completely adequate and as definitely proved that particular method
of approach which under the name of the ""Jung-Grammatiker"" has
dominated linguistic research in Indo-European and Semitic lan-
guages for almost two generations. We do not wish seriously to
criticize this method, but we must regard it as a somewhat unneces-
sarily non-critical attitude to assume that a method, developed in
connection with a group of special languages, has, of necessity, a uni-
versal validity. The leaders of the movement, Brugmann and Delbriick,
made no such claims. All the value that might have accrued to the
general study of linguistics from an unbiased consideration of such
     * In
          justice to the author it should be recorded that this monograph was
completed by him in June, 1922. It was submitted to the University Editorial
Committee for preliminary inspection in 1923, and on their advice abridged by
omission of an English-Wappo vocabulary and other passages, and further con-
densed through conversion of many tabular lists of examples into solid text para-
graphs, in order to reduce cost of publication. This necessitated recopying; the
author lived abroad for a number of years; and it was not until 1928 that it was
possible, through the aid of the Committee on Research in Indian Languages,
Franz Boas chairman, to have a final typescript copy made and verified by the
author.-EDS.
2           University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27new and particular data as that presented by primitive languages, was
thus almost completely lost and primitive idioms became merely new
sources for illustrating the results obtained in the realm of Indo-
European linguistics.
    In America a complete, or almost complete, diVorce from the work
of the great philologists of Europe produced precisely the opposite
result. The two cardinal dogmas of the Jung-Grammatiker, that
phonetic changes are unconscious and without exception and that
analogy plays a tremendous r6le in all languages, are either entirely
neglected or only incidentally treated. This freedom from the restraint
of the classical school of philologists is of the greatest importance and
significance. It enabled Kroeber in his study of Yokuts boldly and
bluntly to deny the first (and most fundamental) dogma of Brugmann-
Leskien that phonetic changes are without exception. He says:'
     The rules for the change of the verb-stem do not apply at all to the noun.
The addition, to certain stems, of one and the same suffix to indicate both the
objective and plural has quite different effects on the stem-vowel according to
the significance of the suffix ... . The vocalic mutations in the language can
therefore not be regarded as due to a single complex system of harmony which is
always equally operative and differs in its results only through dissimilarity of
circumstances. It is evident that there exists a general tendency toward vocalic
harmony which takes form differently not only according to phonetic influences
but in accord with logical differences such as the grammatical categories and the
distinctions of the parts of speech. The Yokuts vocalic system thus is arbitrary
rather than phonetically automatic and appears to be influenced as much by impulses
to express linguistic forms as by purely physiological habits.2    In another place he says of Yokuts:
    In other words an abstract grammatical distinction entirely suspends and
again sets in operation (a) concrete and physical phonetic law.3
    Such a new outlook is not only healthy but necessary if progress is
to be made. I personally believe Kroeber is not right and that his
method of procedure-namely, to claim that we do not have to go
beyond what we actually have knowledge of (in this case one or two
dialects of Yokuts of one particular time)4-is, to my mind, not only
non-historical but needlessly iconoclastic.
    This same spirit of detachment from entangling alliances with the
results of Indo-European linguistic researches is found in all the utter-
ances of Boas. In one of his last statements he presents his conclusions
as follows:5

1929]              Radin: A Gra'mmar of the Wappo Language                          3     .... it may safely be stated from what we know [i.e., of a given language at
one stage of its history], that phonetic traits often belong to languages which are
morphologically entirely distinct .....
     *. .. their [areas of definite types of morphological characterization-redupli-
cation, incorporation, instrumental cases-distribution do not coincide.
            word categories which appear in neighboring languages are sometimes
quite similar.
     .... areas of distribution of phonetic phenomena, of morphological charac-
teristics, and of groups based on similarities in vocabularies .... do not coincide.
    .... phonetic influences [without other influences] do spread from one people
to another.
     It is not so easy to understand the development of similar categories of words
in neighboring languages ... . Equally difficult to understand is the spread
of morphological traits from one language to another [e.g., second third person
in Kutenai and Algonkin].
     .... it would be entirely unwarranted to claim that all similarities of phon-
etics, classification of concepts, or of morphology must be due to borrowing. On
the contrary, their distribution shows that they must be considered as due to
psychological causes such as the unavoidable necessity of classification of experi-
ence in speech, which can lead to a limited number of categories only, or the
physiological possibilities of articulation, that also limit the range of possible
sounds which are sufficiently distinct to the ear for clear understanding.
     If these observations regarding the influence of acculturation upon language
should be correct, then the whole history of American languages must not be
treated on the assumption that all languages which show similarities must be
considered as branches of the same linguistic family ..... We should have to
reckon with the tendency of languages to absorb so many foreign traits, that we
can no longer speak of a single origin, and that it would be arbitrary whether we
associate a language with one or the other of the contributing stocks.
     [In proving relationship of certain languages] The question would remain
to be answered, why there should be such fundamental dissimilarities between by
far the larger number of words [he is speaking of Athabascan, Tlingit, and Haida],
and the question should still be asked how these dissimilarities are to be explained.
    Now whether most of these conclusions are true or not it does
remain a fact that only the method inaugurated and developed by
Boas, that of studying a language in terms of its own special structure,
could possibly have allowed of so independent a stand toward the
results of modern philological research.
    As I understand it the American school of philology has two supreme
virtues: first, it studies primitive languages apart from any philological
preconceptions and presents the grammatical facts descriptively, and
secondly, it constitutes something of a reaction against the excesses of
the Brugmann school. Looking at its method negatively, however, the
American school suffers from two cardinal defects. In the first place it
does not always (if ever) tell us whether or not the descriptive facts
of the given language it presents are to be considered as constituting,
to all intents and purposes, the original classification of categories,
the original types of processes, in fact, the original phonetic system.
4        University o California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27The impression conveyed by most of the sketches in the Handbook of
American Indian Languages is that they are indeed regarded as such
ultimate classifications. Many of the inferences of Boas, Goddard,
etc., point in the same direction. In short, there is an absence of his-
torical perspective. In the second place, the method suffers from a
failure to appreciate exactly how iconoclastic it really is and it fails in
this regard just because it has divorced itself from all relation to the
older method as applied to the investigation of Indo-European languages.
    At first blush it is somewhat difficult to understand how a grouping
of grammatical categories found at a given time should be regarded as
representing a grouping that is supposed to be, in all fundamentals,
the original or quasi-original one for a given language. Tremendous
changes must certainly be conceded for a cultural phenomenon like
language. And this apparent attitude is all the more difficult to fathom
when we are told that ""our aim is to unravel the history of the growth
of human language and, if possible, to discover its underlying and
physiological causes.""6 In order to do so is it necessary to treat the
grammatical system of a language as though it had always been the
same, had never changed? Above all, to hold such a view is it essential
to regard those features, that a descriptive presentation has shown to
be the most specific, as precisely the traits that have exhibited the most
stability? Yet I do not believe that it is unfair to state that this is
exactly what these philologists have done.
     It is quite apparent, however, that the basis of the method of the
authors of the Handbook of American Indian Languages (Sapir and
Thalbitzer excepted), rests on a foundation entirely different from the
customary one. We cannot here enter into the proofs of our.contention,
but it does seem abundantly clear that a definite hypothesis lies at
the bottom of the somewhat strange interpretation of the linguistic
 facts of one specific period, namely, the theory of multiple origin of
 the languages of America, this in turn being but an illustration of the
 general proposition that linguistic categories are of multiple origin.
 Viewed from this angle their whole attitude is intelligible. This hypo-
 thesis, is from the nature of the case, one with which the students of
 Indo-European languages, dealing with idioms belonging to one common
 stock, would have little concern. Their whole method (at least that
 of the Jung-Grammatiker) is to show how diversification has developed
 from original unity. Thus here too the American school is, in spirit,
 fundamentally opposed to the students of the western European
 tongues.

1929]           Radin: A Graimmar of the Wappo Language                5    The genetic problem was thus brushed aside by these philologists
as irrelevant and, at best, not of interest. Unfortunately, as new and
more detailed data were obtained and apparent similarities increased,
it assumed an unexpected importance. And here it is, it seems to me,
that the protagonists of the multiple origin theory (expressed or unex-
pressed) have shown a surprising lack of progressive vision. One might
have expected that the leaders in so revolutionary an implied criticism
of prevalent methods in, comparative philology would have recognized
that a theory like that of multiple origin was of value only in so far as
it explained the facts better than any other. Instead of that, instead
of welcoming the possibility of a new synthesis, they have developed
a new series of highly problematical assumptions like the wholesale
borrowing of morphological traits and a vaguely defined type of accul-
turation. Now the whole significance of the method of the American
school has lain in its freedom from stereotyped dogmas and it seems
somewhat of a retrograde step for it to cling so tenaciously to an
unproved hypothesis and emphasize purely negative aspects of the
problem.
    We indicated before that the American school has not quite realized
how iconoclastic its method really has been and that this ignorance
is to be ascribed to 'its lack of contact with the European philological
method. But this divorce has had other serious consequences. It has
prevented the results obtained from the study of the American lan-
guages from making their contribution to the possible solution of the
problems that have for many years puzzled Indo-European scholars,
 the case system, the nature of conjugations, numerous syntactical
 questions, etc. What is perhaps even more disastrous, the method of
 presentation adopted, for instance, in the Handbook of American
 Indian Languages, has, on the whole, in its reaction against the Latin
 scheme of grammar and in its lack of concern with other types of
 presentation, taken on such a form as to make it needlessly difficult.
    In the following grammar I shall make an attempt to present the
facts of the Wappo language as I found them in the texts and from
 questioning my informants. I shall at the same time bear in mind
continually that Wappo has had a history which is often fairly clearly
disclosed in numerous forms. That interpretations of this kind are
highly subjective I would be one of the first to admit. But the facts
are presented quite apart from any hypothesis and in such a way as
to allow others to form their own conclusions.
    But more important is another question I have continually borne
in mind. To describe one more type of primitive language, now that
6        University of Califorvua Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27we in America know so many, is an achievement of very doubtful
value, unless somehow, in some way, fundamental problems are touched
upon. They need not necessarily be comparative; they may concern
Wappo alone. With that ideal in view I have tried to show Wappo
in all its variety, have attempted to indicate all the meanings, vague,
indefinite, or clear-cut, that a given element may have. Throughout
I have sought to exhibit the language in all its multiplicity and fluidity;
to show how some of the elements are fixed and petrified, others utterly
unanchored. In thus presenting a dynamic study of a language of
whose history we are ignorant, I quite realize all the dangers I am
running, but if it will help, if only in a very moderate degree, to con-
tribute something toward the solution of the problems connected with
the mechanism of linguistic changes, I shall be amply repaid.

                           PART I. GRAMMAR
                     §1. HABITAT AND STATUS OF WAPPO
    Wappo, one of the languages of the Yukian stock of which the
 other members are Yuki proper, Coast Yuki, and Huchnom, is spoken
today by a mere handful of people. Indeed it is doubtful whether,
when the material for this grammar was obtained (1917), there were
more than twenty individuals who spoke it correctly and certainly
 only one, Jim Tripo, now deceased, who had any extensive knowledge
 of the old mythology. According to some informants Wappo was
spoken in a number of sub-dialects but these seem to have varied
 only in details of vocabulary.
    Practically all the Wappo are supposed to live at Alexander Valley,
Sonoma county, California, a few miles distant from Healdsburg,
although as a matter of fact only a few families live there, the majority
spending most of their time in the various settlements near Healdsburg
and Cloverdale.
    The Wappo, at one time, occupied two small and entirely discon-
nected areas, both of them quite separated from their kindred, the
Yuki. The first one lay in Napa and Sonoma counties and the other,
much smaller, at the southern end of Lake county.7
    The first or main Wappo area is surrounded by that of the Southern
Pomo, Northern Miwok, and Southern Wintun (Patwin), the second
by the Southeastern and Eastern Pomo. Yet in spite of this contiguity
practically no specific linguistic borrowing has taken place between
the Wappo and their neighbors, the resemblances that exist being of
such a kind as to point not to secondary borrowing but to old genetic
relationship.
    The language as spoken today contains only a handful of Spanish
words in spite of the strong missionary influence to which it was sub-
jected. In several tales of Spanish origin, which in addition are probably
translations from that language into Wappo, a number of loan-words
were encountered. In the other myths and texts transcribed, none
were found.
   I   Cf. Barrett, this series, 6:263 ff., for full description of boundaries.
8        University of California Publicationm in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27    One of the most important features of the spoken language as
known today is its deviation in certain grammatical details and vocabu-
lary from the language of the texts, at least from that in which all the
myths told by Tripo were couched. My interpreter always referred
to this as the ""high language"" and experienced occasionally some
difficulty in understanding a few of the forms. It is difficult to state
definitely exactly in what the difference lies. This much is clear, how-
ever, that in the question of verb irregularities the spoken and written
language are at one. Certain suffixes like the aspects -cele, -mEle, -sElE,
-kElE, the inferential (?) -k-, vowel mutation for subjunctive, etc., are
rarely used in the spoken language, or if used, only with the vaguest
of meanings. On the other hand a number of suffixes with subjunctive
force, rarely if ever encountered with this signification in the texts
(-lEk-, -te-, -ta-, -la-) are widely employed in the present-day conver-
sational speech.
    The grammar that follows is based largely on the texts of two indi-
viduals, Jim Tripo and Joe McCloud, both men over sixty who spoke
Wappo perfectly. The former, now deceased, had spent many years
of his life among the Eastern Pomo and spoke that language quite
fluently; the latter claimed at one time to have known Spanish better
than Wappo; and there is a possibility that the tales of Spanish origin
dictated by him have been influenced by Spanish idioms.
    The texts have been published as ""Wappo Texts"" in volume 19
of this series, in 1924.
    A11 the texts obtained were translated by McCloud. He is also
responsible for all the grammatical forms obtained in connection with
them.

                                  §2. General
    The sound-system of Wappo is comparatively simple. The vowels
appear in two series, a short-open (e, L, a, v) and a medium-long-closed
(e, i, o, u, a). Diphthongs are quite common. The stops are well
developed and the spirants moderately so. Whether three series of
stops occur (sonant, surd, glottalized surd) is an open question. Kroeber8
heard them whereas Barrett did not, while I am uncertain although
inclined to agree with Kroeber. To my ear, however, the series seems
to be unaspirated stop, long stop, glottalized stop. There is no question
in my mind that today, when Wappo cannot be said to be spoken by
more than twenty people, certain sounds are tending to be merged
with one another. For instance, the unaspirated is becoming assimilated
to the long stop that, in turn, has become shortened; the glottalized
is becoming confused with the long stop, and the peculiar palatalized t
with the ordinary t.
    Accent is exclusively one of stress although there seemed to be a
suggestion of pitch in connection with the future and imperative.
    The timbre of vowels is affected by neighboring consonants, and
final vowels quite frequently disappear. Vocalic consonance undoubt-
edly exists, Wappo differing in this respect from Yuki proper.
    No original consonant clusters exist although secondary ones are
very frequent.
    All terminal vowels that are not aspirated, i.e., in other words,
the overwhelming majority, are weakly glottalized.
                          §3. Description of Consonants
    The following consonants are found:

and palatal stops, the labials originally also had a three-fold series,
although today only p and p' are found. p' is rather uncommon.
    Dentals.-t is quite distinct from the ordinary English sound and
more like that of Spanish. Occasionally, in initial position, it was
heard as English d. t. in present-day speech has not infrequently
fallen together with t but not to the same extent as k. with k. t' repre-
sents a fairly weakly glottalized t but seems to have been only rarely
confused with t.
    t and V' represent a true series quite distinct from t. In addition
to being palatalized t gives the impression acoustically of a lateral
consonant and was indeed often written as tr. These sounds, we know,
have a fairly extensive distribution. I personally am inclined to regard
them as transformations of the lateral 1.
    Palatals.-k is medial. It was never heard as a sonant. k- was
heard in two positions, as a back-palatal and as intermediate between
k. and weak velar q. The velar tinge was so inconsistently given that
it seemed best to regard it as of no importance. My final feeling was
that two distinct k's were involved here, a back-palatal and a velar
which- have today practically fallen together both in Wappo and Yuki
proper.
     k' shows a marked tendency to merge with k..
     Affricatives.-That tc and ts are quite distinct is unquestionable,
although they resemble each other so closely that they were, at times,
difficult to keep apart, just as in the case of c and s. Both these conso-
nants, however, often resembled c and s acoustically and it is just
 conceivable that in addition to the series tc and ts there may have
 existed in Wappo or Yuki, at one time, a series intermediate between
 tc and c and ts and s.
     Spirants.-c and s, although so similar in sound that they were
 frequently confused, are quite distinct in origin. They were never
 heard as j or z.
     Nasals.-They are pronounced as in English.
     Laterals.- 1has the continental value. Occasionally it was heard
 as dorsal (1). But this is quite secondary and due to a preceding
 aspirated vowel.
     As pointed out above, a frequent phonetic phenomenon in Wappo
 is the merging of unaspirated and of glottalized stops with long stops.
 The most obvious interpretation seems to be, that owing to the small
 number of people still speaking Wappo fluently, the various conso-
 nantal series have developed a tendency to assimilate.

                           §4. Description of Vowels
     On superficial study all vowels, particularly terminal ones, seem to
occur in three forms: simple, aspirated, and glottalized. The glottalized
is, however, purely secondary and of no historical importance, terminal
vowels being always either glottalized or aspirated. Similarly aspiration
simply indicates a syncopated syllable, h+vowel, that has been
reduced to ' owing to loss of following vowel.
    The following vowels are found:
     Closed and medium in length: a, e, i, o, u.
    Open and short: e, t, a, v.
    Semi-vowels: w, y.
    These vowels occur in all positions, with the exception of e which
is practically never found terminally. A marked tendency exists for
most of the closed vowels to become open and short terminally.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

                       §§65-69. FORMATION OF TENSE
                           §65. Introduction
    Wappo seems originally to have possessed an indefinite tense, a
future, and two pasts. This gives us then:
                      Indefinite -i (-a, -e).
                             Future        -si (-.si).
                             Past  -ta, -ki.
    A certain significance attaches to this duplication because of the
repeated insistence by my informant upon two forms for each tense,
one used in a general statement, the other in what he called ""answer
to a question,"" i.e., a responsive. Such responsive forms occur in some
American languages (Salish, Central Wintun, Southwestern Pomo) and
have probably been overlooked in others. I suspect that some other
meaning is or was at one time connected with this responsive-namely,
presence and absence. Unfortunately either this responsive is very
irregular and passing out of existence, or my interpreter could not
explain the matter adequately-the fact remains that there were
numerous contradictions. What seems to be reasonably clear is that
-ta was often used as direct-past, -ki responsive-past, -si direct-future.
96        University of California Publications in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.   [VoL 27-yaomi (a periphrastic form) responsive-future. The indefinite which
has a vague present-momentaneous connotation would naturally have
only one form.
    Now the first question that presents itself is this: If the responsive
(or whatever was its former meaning), is an old trait why is it con-
nected with a secondary and late formation of the future -yaomi?
If -yaomi has displaced an older formation is there any trace of it
today? The hortatory -a- immediately occurs to one's mind. Many
things speak in favor of this -a- (really a petrified ablauted terminal
vowel), being an old responsive. First, some responsives are formed
by ablaut and secondly -a- with the meaning of hortatory-subjunctive
impresses one as secondary.
    The second point concerns the history of -ta and -ki. -ta is unknown
in Yuki proper. It is common enough in many Indian languages.
-ki appears in Yuki as a present and verbalizer of adjective stems.
This latter function is also characteristic of its force in Wappo. How-
ever it is also quite likely that there are two -ki, one a general verbalizer,
the other a past tense."" The Yuki forms for the past are -wi-(-u)
ordinary and -witc (obviously related to -wi), completed past. As two
forms for the future occur, -pa future and -mik immediate futurity
or future intent, one is tempted to equate them with the Wappo re-
sponsive formations. However until more information upon Coast
Yuki and Huchnom is forthcoming this would be too hazardous.","[104, 105]"
"
                     §33. Combination of Prefixes
    Most verb-stems can have two and often three prefixes. The follow-
ing combinations of two prefixes are quite common: homa-, home-,
hona-, hope-, maime-, mapa-, meme-, mena-, mepi-, mepe-, napi-,
pama-, pame-, pana-, pame-, papo-, teme-, tena-, tcama-, tceme-,
tcame-, tcana-. Examples will be found throughout this sketch.
I append a few:
     a'napi-ca'liya, I whisper; mapi-ka'hasi, it squeaks; mena-t'o'aki, he arrived;
maimo-te'pi, she lay down; hope-pu'te, to handle and stir up; homa-ta'osa, he
pretends; meme-ts'ai'mi, he is leaning; meme-he'lesi, he is in a hurry; a'mona-ca'-
telsi, I'll drink up; mena-ts-a'kel, to hold head up; pame-pi'le, to fold; pana-k-a""e,
to bite; papo'-tctti, to tie strings together (?); cupe-he'teski, he is folding his arms;
tema-wi""ita, he grabbed in the air; tetc-ta""asi, let him step in; teme-cu'teta, he
jerked it from above; tc*ana-k'e'te1, to bite off with teeth; tc-ama-te'hel, to let
loose.
    In most verbs with three prefixes, the first one is the pronominal
te- and mai'-.
    tememe-cu'ttta, she jerked him; mai'mepi-ya'haki, he went past quietly.
    In the sixth position, that nearest the stem, we find only three pre-
fixes, for one of which there is only a single example (nat'o'aki, he
arrived). The second, pu-, by sucking, is of limited use, and the third
pi-, near, diminutive activity, one of the most important and exten-
sively used prefixes in Wappo. That pi-, an adverbial element, should
be treated differently from the others seems to imply that it had become
fused at an early time with so many verb-stems that, in spite of the fact
that it became a free prefix, i.e., could be used with any verb, the
position immediately near the stem asserted itself too strongly for it
to be removed to the fourth position occupied by the other adverbial
prefixes. Regarding the important question as to whether we can
always gauge the approximate relative age of a prefix from its proximity
to the stem, our answer must, on the whole, be negative, because it
seems clear, first, that true composita (noun+verb) may arise at any
time and the noun of such composita becomes grouped with sixth
position elements, or such a detached element as, for instance, cu-
might secondarily be felt as belonging to another group and transferred
40       University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27to it. It would, I feel quite confident, be exceedingly safe to consider
all the third and fourth position prefixes as of the same age. On the
other hand, the very fact that adverbial elements are placed in one
group, instrumentals in another, and that detached portions of com-
posita can be regrouped all this speaks for a considerable age for
prefixation.
                 §§34-64. SUFFIXATION IN THE VERB
                             §34. Introduction
    Suffixation is clearly an old process in Wappo, and one that is still
in full force. The firmness with which the vast majority of the suffixes
are fused to the verb-stem is the most convincing proof of their age,
and the ease with which independent verbs can be reduced first to
postpositions and then to semi-suffixes is the best evidence of the
continuous vigor of the process itself. Perhaps another indication is
to be found in the fact that barely more than a half-dozen of the suffixes
can be derived from any known independent stem.
    As far as degree of fusion with the verb-stem is concerned, it can
hardly be said that there is any noticeable difference in the suffixes
until we come to those connected with the periphrastic tenses and
those serving as subordinating conjunctions. In these cases the fusion
with the verb-stem is weak, and this is correlated with the fact that
they are all palpably fairly recent developments. They are indeed all
either old independent verbs (ya, mi, mak, mesi) or adverbs (tsel, wen,
tu, tseta).
    In the case of the verbal prefixes we pointed out that while a few
were found employed as nominal suffixes, the vast majority are now
used only with verbs. For the suffixes this does not hold true. Leaving
aside the petrified elements and those referring to tense, we find among
the nominal affixes a large number identical with those of the verbs
and possessing the same meaning, at the same time having such marked
similarity in form as to suggest definite relationship. How we are to
interpret this is not easy to decide. Yet it appears to be but one of a
number of features all pointing in the same direction, namely toward a
marked nominalization of the verb. We noted it previously in the case
of such pronominal possessive prefixes as te-, me-, mai-. We find it
again in the r6le played by iterative -te, continuative -1, usitative -s-,
plural -mv, and the various instrumental suffixes -i, -noma, -ma, -ka.
Now when we compare -te, -1, and -s- with nominal -ti plural, -lu
collective plural, -si, demonstrative and numeral plural, and with the
nominal plural -ma -(Yuki), there seems little question but that they
19291            Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                  41are identical and that their use in verbs is secondary. This very same
feature is one of the characteristics of Hokan as shown by Pomo,
Washo, Salinan, and to a more limited extent Achomawi. It is this
same tendency which has led to the loss of the vowels of the tense
suffixes -ki, -ce, -se before the subordinating suffixes -tsel and -wen,
thus converting them into absolute forms of the verb and merging them
into nominal constructions comparable to the noun formatives -k, -s, -c.
    Just as the prefixes and suffixes differ in regard to the degree of
their specific association with the verb so they differ in regard to their
origin. That of the prefixes is manifest. They are practically all either
nouns, adverbs, demonstratives, or verbs. The origin of the suffixes
is not so evident; but one thing is clear, namely that the majority of
them have been functioning for an extremely long time as suffixes
only. We might thus quite justifiably claim that the prefixes plus verb
represent a type of stem composition and that the suffixes plus verb
do not.
    There are, however, a few suffixes that definitely do represent such
a type of stem-composition. They are all connected with the peri-
phrastic constructions and with the causatives. Two old verbs meaning
to go, to move, both sparingly used now, mv and ya, are employed for
the periphrastic. What interests us in both verbs is that each has appar-
ently been called into service a number of times. We have, for instance,
an indefinite in -ya representing a specialization of the original verb to
go, that certainly antedates considerably the development of -yao and
-yaomi into a future; and we have an indefinite in -mi that must very
considerably antedate -ma and -mak. Indeed it is extremely doubtful
whether -ma and -mak belong to the same stratum and whether -ma
is not really a very old suffix meaning ""motion toward,"" also found in
Yuki, and -mak simply a recent development from makce, to move.
In that case -ma would be even older than -mi. The importance of
this frequent selection of two words, both referring to movement, lies
in the fact that it suggests a considerable age for this tendency toward
periphrastic constructions. This is of double significance for the history
of Wappo since it connects it even more definitely with the Hokan
groups where such constructions are old and frequent, and it explains
the irregularities in the indefinite tense. These are clearly due to the
fact that the various indefinites were in origin periphrastic construc-
tions that have largely lost their original force.
    For the causatives likewise we must assume a varied history and
perhaps the employment, at distinctly separated periods, of the same
verb to do, to make, since the causatives -si, -mesi, and -tasi are related.
42         Univer8ity of CaUforn4a Publoations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27Then we have in addition an old causative no longer functional -a, -ha'
and perhaps a still older one, the petrified suffix -k. We might also
point out that this continuous development of causatives bespeaks the
existence of an old tendency of this type. There iq even a farther evolu-
tion in Wappo for we find today the verb tcuti, to order, on the point
of developing into a postposition with causative significance.
    If therefore stem-composition seems to play a meagre r6le, may we
not ascribe this to the ease with which verbs of motion and causation
were absorbed into a general periphrastic scheme that quickly deprived
such verbs of specific meaning? We shall see later how the tendency
to nominalize verbs tended likewise to prevent stem-composition.
    Little need be said about the order in which suffixes follow each
other. There are seven positions:
    First position: petrified suffixes.
    Second position: verb-base vowels.
    Third position: -k- (unknown), -s-, -c-, -4 passive, -1 continuative.
    Fourth position: increments (-te-, -4e, -lek, -mak, subjunctives,
        causatives).
    Fifth position: -k- inferential.
    Sixth position: tense-aspect, imperative.
    Seventh position: subordinating, nominalizing.
    As the vast majority of suffixes are connected with tense, mode,
and aspect formation they will be discussed more fully in the sections
devoted to these subjects (§65-80).","[48, 49, 50, 51]"
"                    §§48-50. VERBAL TENSE-ASPECT ROOTS
           §48. Wappo Verb Base from a Phonetic Viewpoint
    The Wappo verb base, as we have just seen, is from a phonetic
viewpoint exceedingly variable, a variability due to both phonetic and
morphological causes. In §§51-53 we shall group all the verbs in the
language according to the nature of the differences between the various
tense-aspect stems. Here we wish merely to present them in terms
of the number of roots each verb shows, leaving aside, for the moment,
the question whether they are primary or secondary.
    Looked at in this way the verbs fall into three divisions: those that
have but one root, i.e., show no change; those that have two roots;
and those that have three. The first group need not detain us except
to state that it contains, at most, forty percent of the verbs, possibly
really not more than thirty per cent. The mhajority of the verbs belong
to the second and third divisions. As many examples are given in
the section on Types of Stem-Formation, I shall give here only enough
to show the nature of the stem variability. I am not including the
increments -lek- and -mok-.
                            §49. Verbs with Three Roots
     a'sva, a'sisi, a's-ta, give (a-i-v34); i'li, i'lesi, ilta, bind (i-e-v); amiso'mci,
amiso'mVci, amisomike, become evening (v-v-i); o-i'-se, oye'lsi, o'ye, move (i-[y]
el-e); oli'tsmi, oli'tsa-tasi, oli'tse, fill up (v-a-e); onana pise, onana'pelsi, onana'-
piyel, graze (i-[eJl-yel); ot.a'pmi, ot-a'pesi, ot.a'pte, stab (v-e-te); otso'kmi,
otso'kesi, otso'kuta, shove (v-c-u); ha'c, ha'yesi, hai'yi, say (e-yc-yi); hawi,
hawesi, ha'ota (hawta), pick up (i-c-v); hale'wi, hale'uta (holewta), hole, hunt
(i-v-v, the imperative loses -wv, the past -e-); hukalice, huk'alelsi, huka'le, think
(i-el-e); huke'hi, huke'hesi, huke""ta, huke'hel, shove (this is a fourfold differen-
tiation, i-e-v-l); husi""le, husi'htki, husi'htla, lie on back (lc-v-la).

for the third base is clearly due to slight phonetic variations and is so
clearly bound up with the whole question of the nature of the final
vowel of the indefinite, possibly being either the terminal vowel of the
stem of a tense-aspect suffix or both, that no importance need be
attached to this apparent triple change. The type of change met with
in verbs possessing two roots is quite different, as we shall see.","[77, 78]"
"                                   §108. Connectives
    Wappo has a fairly large, number of connectives indicating rather
fine shades of relationship of the different parts of the sentence to each
other. The most important connectives are the demonstrative-pos-
sessives -te and me, the equivalents of Latin eius and suus. This same
function is expressed in Yuki proper by si and sa .49
    The most important connectives are the following:
    ma""a, and, then (does not begin a sentence); pa't-a, then (with correlative
force; begins many sentences); yo, Latin-que; tse, tse'o, tse'ti, tse'ma, tse'ta,
tse'ka, tsel, then (these all have different shades of meaning); -wen, subordinating;
tu, because.

                                       Old Rock
    At k'anamot*a (St. Helena mountain) in the Grapevine-flat-land it is said
Gray-Squirrel lived with his grandmother wima (unknown animal). Now (long)
before that when (the boy) was still young Old Rock had killed his father and
taken away the latter's wife and brought her to his own home. And thus the
boy lived alone with his grandmother; thus in that way he lived.
    Then when he grew up, when he became large, he went outside and walked
along and with a stone he shot a deer, his ear he shot. Then from there he ran back
to his grandmother. Then his grandmother (went and) packed the deer home from
that place.
     ""How would I be able to kill many for you, grandmother?"" But his grand-
mother wept with him, bruised herself, and shoved dirt into her mouth. The
boy seized hold of his grandmother (saying) ""Don't do that! Have compassion
upon me grandm8ther! What are you doing? You are hurting yourself! That is
what I am saying to you!""
    Then she skinned the deer with her finger-nails, skinning it for her grandchild.
""Well, eat!"" she said. Then they ate and after eating they went to sleep.
     ""Grandmother, is there not some way in which I can kill them (deer)?""
""Yes, there is something with which to kill them."" So in the morning she got
up and ate again. Then she took down her bag (hanging) at the top (ceiling)
of the house, untied it, and took out the quiver (?) and abalone-shell (and) they
looked beautiful. Arrows she put into the quiver and then reaching backwards
again she took out the bow (and) that too looked beautiful. (Then) she made
stripes on the back of the bow and the boy was happy.
     ""Don't go far for all sorts of evil things are around here."" ""All right, grand-
mother,"" said he.
    To a country where it was flat all around there he arrived. Beautiful it looked.
Deer were standing (all) around. Then there he shot and killed ten and he stopped.
Then he dragged them together, these deer, to one place and piled them all up.
Then he ran back to his house, to his grandmother. ""What's the matter? Why
are you running so fast?"" ""O I am running back from the Flat country (for)
there in one place I have dragged together the ten deer that I shot."" ""All right,""
said his grandmother. Then she took her packing-string, her cord packing-string,
put it around herself and ran back to (where he had come from). Then she arrived
where the deer had been piled up. Then she put them inside her bag, all ten of
them and she carried them, packing them (home). Then (where some) dried
manzanita stood she shook them and pulled up (the bushes) by the roots and
put them (across) her shoulder. At the door a wide stone was lying and with
that she ground the manzanita (berries ?) and broke them into small pieces.
Then the boy built a fire near his grandmother.
     Now this woman (his grandmother) again skinned (the deer) with her finger-
nails and a rabbit she skinned for him (the boy) too. Then she looked for a fat
one (deer), that she pounded, (prepared) a whole deer for her grandson. Then
she turned it around by the horn and turned it around again and again for a long
160       Univerity of California Publioations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.    [Vol. 27time and when it was cooked she took it out. ""Come, eat!"" she said. ""All right,""
answered her grandson.
     Then the boy went in the house, brought a basket with mush from it, and they
ate and ate again.
     One whole deer they finished and afterwards the wi'ma woman (his grand-
mother) continued eating up the various (foods). Then they slept and a long time
they slept.
    In the evening she brought a fat one (deer) in again ............
    Then he got to the top of a hill and from there he looked around below and
as the sun was crawling out he heard some singing. ""Who is doing this, who?""
(it sang). The boy looked and there down below (was) Rock (from whom) all
kinds of trees and various objects were suspended. With all this he came along
towards the youth.
    Then the youth saw him. ""Look here,"" said (Rock), ""is this a place for
walking around? Tracks are visible all around here (and things) have been rolling
over me, rocks, trees rolling over me! (That's why) I killed your father! On
that side (he ?) was stirring me up, rolling rocks, rolling lfees!""
    Upon that he came forward towards the boy. With his rock he came, and
on his body stood all sorts of things-pine-trees, live-oaks, choke-cherry trees,
all kinds of trees. Then toward the youth he came. The youth remained still,
sitting there. When he was near him (Rock said) ""Why are you stirring me up?""
    ""Say, what are you chattering so much for?"" ""What grandchild, grandchild!
Why that's my singing you heard,.grandchild. I always sing when I go around.""
Then, (the Rock) came near to the boy. How fearful the Old Rock looked; and
the youth still looked down upon him.
    ""Now, grandson, that one of us who is the bravest should be here first (to-
morrow) morning. We shall (try) to get ahead of each other, we expert hill-
climbers."" ""Why you cannot be here before me! Look how you walk, how slowly
you trudge along! I feel sorry for you (when) you walk""........

    -le plural has been discussed in part in a number of places. Like
-te it is fused idiomatically with certain stems; with others it is employed
as a future-past increment and nominal (collective) plural (-lu, -lo)
although rarely used as such today. As a functional plural suffix of
verbs it is extensively used in present-day Wappo in contradistinction
to -te. It probably occurs in the texts, too. But there it is so closely
bound up with the whole question of -le passive that the two are diffi-

120       University of California PubUcations in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.   [VoL 27    -melc, -cele, -selt were frequently translated in the texts as plural
in force but this may merely represent a circumlocution for the passive.
If they represent true plurals it is undoubtedly the -le that carries this
meaning. -lek was likewise often rendered as a subjunctive with
indefinite or plural force (cf. §72). Here too it was probably -l- that
carried the plural significance.                       §86. -mi Plural Imperative
   This has been discussed in some detail in §71. No absolutely certain
example of it with non-imperative force has been obtained unless it be
the -me of hotco""me, they walk (contrasted with hotca'ho, he walks).
Homonyms (-mi indefinite tense suffix, -ma, -ma progressive and
passive?) have made it very difficult to get any satisfactory results.
The pronoun mu' (mul), all, the nominal plural -ma and the extensive
use of -ma in Southwestern Pomo, and the evidence of a number of
other Hokan languages speak in favor of -mi having been more ex-
tensively used at an earlier stage.                        §87. -ku Imperative Dual(?)
    The meaning of -ku is problematical (cf. §38). -ku may be cognate
with the very mysterious infix-suffix -ke-, that in its usage suggests
the plural-dual. In any case its force is not felt today. If -ku- of -kumi
is dual we would have a dual suffix followed by a plural suffix. The
same would hold for -kele and -kete. This is not, however, an insuperable
difficulty for it might only imply that the original meaning of -ku- had
been completely forgotten, for we have exactly the same in the unques-
tioned dual pronoun kato which most likely consists of -ko- dual and -te
plurafl
    The survival of the dual in Wappo is a very remarkable feature,
for Yuki proper shows no trace of it and among Hokan languages it is
apparently only encountered in Achomawi. It is, however, character-
istic of all Californian Penutian languages and is actually ko in Yokuts.","[128, 129]"
"                  §71. Formation of the Imperative Plural
    There are two primary suffixes indicating the imperative plural,
-lumi and -tumi. To these must be added -kumi probably dual in
significance, -tdlumi and -ktlumi.
    That -1(u)- and -t(u)- are variants of -4e- and -te-, the continuative
and distributive affixes, is quite clear. Under no conditions, however,
are they to be regarded as variants of -le and -te- when used as incre-
ments of certain verbs. These plural imperatives have developed quite
independently. The -mi is far more puzzling and is to be taken either
as the personal pronoun second singular or as an old imperative suffix
that survives in supplicative-imperative -me. I personally incline to
the second belief. -tdlumi' represents probably the increment -te- and
-lumi the corresponding -lelumi, both having contracted respectively
to -lumi and -tumi. -kLlumi is not at all clear but possibly represents
the increment -k- and -lumi'. No consistent difference in meaning
could be obtained for -lumi', -tumi', -tLlumi', -kdlumi', and there is
only partial justification for crediting -kumi' with a dual force. For
examples cf. §38.
                     §72. Formation of the Subjunctive
    What has the force of a true subjunctive is formed by the affixation
directly to the future base, of three suffixes -tasi, -tesi, and -leksi, the
first having an indefinite present force, the second something of the
value of the imperfect, and the third that of an aorist with indefinite
plural subject. To these must be added the suffix -uk&si with the value
of a passive subjunctive and lastly, an apparent mutation of the
terminal stem-vowel.
    Up to the present no examples of -tasi, -tesi, and -leksi with the
values assigned to them here have been found in the texts, but this
1929]            19adisn: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                       107function was so consistently and repeatedly assigned to them while
obtaining the ""principal parts"" of the verbs that I see no reason what-
soever for questioning it. The very fact that only a limited number
of verbs were credited with possessing, now one, now all of these three
forms, should go far toward proving them to be authentic.
    Terminal stem-vowel mutation is, on the contrary, abundantly
illustrated in the texts, although one is often left in doubt whether to
consider this vowel change as connected with the subjunctive proper
or with general subordination.

l-eksi, someone might wash; t'o'[eksi, someone might whip; patca'tesi, he might

    How to explain the force of these three suffixes is not very easy.
    -leksi and -tesi are formally identical with the increment futures.
Are we to regard the subjunctive significance as a secondary develop-
ment from simple increment futures or, on the contrary, to interpret
the subjunctive force as original? Certain facts point toward the first
alternative, others toward the latter. -lek, for instance, resolves itself
readily into -4e- continuative-increment and -k inferential, thus pointing
to a subjunctive-inferential meaning as original. -tesi, on the other
108       University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.        [VoL 27hand, is the regular increment future. -tasi is puzzling, but is perhaps
best interpreted as -t- increment and -asi hortatory, although this is
not quite convincing.
   With regard to their age all seem to be secondary developments
within Wappo, although further data from Yuki proper is required
before this can be definitely proved.

    That there is a vowel mutation here is quite clear. -It appears to
be somewhat confused in its operation but one fact stands out quite
distinctly,-that this irregular vocalic mutation is associated with a
subjunctive force and with the general idea of subordination. It seems
quite justifiable to assume that the expression of the subjunctive lay
in the vowel mutation and that the rule was for the terminal vowel to
change its timbre.
                      §73. Formation of the Hortatory
    This is one of the most regular constructions in the language, all
terminal stem vowels without exception changing to -a-, followed by
the future suffix -si. In origin the hortatory is to be regarded as con-
nected with the subjunctive.

  §§74-80. FORMATION OF THE PASSIVE, SEMI-PASSIVE, ASPECTS,
                        AND ABSOLUTE
                                 §74. Introduction
     Two special elements appear to be associated with the passive, the
formative -u and the suffix -la, -4e. The suffix -ki that generally follows
-u, did not, we have seen, originally possess any passive significance.
This lay entirely in the -u character of the stem.
     The interpretation of -la, -le is more difficult. On the basis of the
Wappo facts only two possibilities seem warranted, either that it is an
historically old passive or semi-passive suffix or a special development
of the plural -1, -4e. If the latter interpretation is true then it is hardly
to be regarded as a true passive but as the plural subject of a transitive
verb, i.e., I was killed by him =they (indefinite) killed me. Such
 ""psuedo-passives"" occur in Achomawi and Southwestern Pomo.
Composite forms such as -mele, -sele, -cele, -kdel speak in favor of this
view and so does the Yuki evidence of Kroeber where these suffixes
 (-mil, -sil, -cil, -kil) have no passive significance. On the other hand,
the medio-passive force of -la in ca'kula, it split, hu'pla, it jumped out,
pici'ula, it is breezy, hutsi'ula, to smile, etc. speaks against it. There
is a way out of the difficulty, namely, to regard -la as -1- continuative
with an -a of unknown force. We may indeed be dealing with two dis-
tinct elements, one plural and the other passive.
     Under the circumstances I prefer to regard -la, -le as an old passive
although -la passive as a development from 4- continuative has many
attractions.
     There are a number of composite passives -mcle, -sele, -ccle, -kele
formed by the fusion of the tense-aspects -me-, -ce-, -se-, and -ke- with
-le. Of these -mele seems to have developed the special significance of
a passive of known agent.","[115, 116, 117, 118]"

72       UTniver8ity of Ca4fornia Publcations in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27                      §53. Types of Stem-Formation
    Of these seventeen types the first, the regular, is most frequent.
Types 2, 3, 4 are, on the whole, rare; 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 fairly common;
10, 11, 14 extremely rare; and 15, 16, 17 not common.
    How these types arose is fairly clear. The loss of vowel and muta-
tion of vowel in the indefinite is due to the morphological significance
of the suffixes of the indefinite, all of which refer to durative and
progressive aspect. This has caused, on the one hand, the terminal
stem vowel to change into durative -i and, on the other, the elision of
old causative -a as redundant. That, in origin, the vocalic mutation
was due to phonetic, specifically accentual conditions is quite plausible,
even probable, but this vocalic instability was perpetuated and then
extended because it had secondarily become associated with a specific
morphological significance. Similarly, vocalic elision in the indefinite
may have been caused originally by the influence of accent, or better,
the preservation of the vowel in increment forms may be due to shift
of accent. Its subsequent extension was due to the realization of the
force of the indefinite suffix as progressive, durative, etc., so that the
causative -a- was felt as redundant. The future and preterit suffixes
referring only to tense proper are associated with no phonetic changes
except an occasional loss of reduced -e- or -&- for the past. It is true
that the preterit in -ki does, at times, round the preceding vowel, but
this is due to the fact that it has become confused with the passive
-ki which fairly regularly changes a terminal stem vowel to -o, -u, -a.
    The second type of change, the insertion of increments in the future
and preterit, and more irregularly in the imperative, is entirely morpho-
logical in origin. The only question to be answered here is why the
indefinite stem does not possess them. Again this may possibly be
explained by the influence of the suffixes of that tense-aspect, for these
have essentially the same force as many of the increments. That at
bottom it is the suffix that has been the obstacle to the extension of
increments to the indefinite is proved by the fact that the moment
these suffixes are omitted these increments can be and are employed.
Indeed we may assume that in an older phase of the language, before
the fusion of the indefinite stem with so many aspect suffixes, the
indefinite (probably a true present tense at that time), did actually
possess the increments -te-, -1-, and possibly -mv-, for a fairly large
number of verbs contain a petrified -t- and -1- that is certainly identical
with increments -te- and -1-. It is a notable fact that the vast majority
of these verbs do not take the aspect suffixes (-mi, -se, -cc, -ya) in the
indefinite but use the vowels (-i, -e, -a) instead.
1929]            BadcA: A G-rammar of the Wappo LanIuage                      73    In general then it may be said that the absence of the increments
(-te, -4, -le[k], -ma[k]) in the indefinite is secondary and that they lost
them subsequently, just as they lost certain vowels. Two of the aspect
suffixes, -sv and -cv, are still found frequently fused to the indefinite
stem, and it is this fact that makes types 15 and 16 so rare.
    With regard to the third type of change, the shift of accent in the
future, this is definitely phonetic in origin and represents a type of
change that was extended in order to avoid confusion with the indefi-
nite which in all these cases ends in -sv. We shall see in the discussion
of the future tense that three methods were adopted to prevent the
future and indefinite of certain verbs from falling together; the one
mentioned above, the use of -yaomi instead of -si, and the use of the
hortatory -asi instead of the regular -esi. I am inclined to believe
that -e'si (shifted accent) is the oldest, and that it in reality does not
at all represent a shifting of accent but a preservation of an original
pitch accent. A satisfactory proof unfortunately cannot be given. At
any rate we are in this instance concerned with a purely phonetic
change that became significant and was extended because it served a
definite morphological function.
    We shall now turn to a discussion of the different types.
    Type 1.-Fully fifty per cent of the verbs belong to this type. All
the following stem forms are found: c+v, c+vv, c+v+c, c+v+c+v,
v+v, v+c+v.
   1. c+v.
   ka""-ci, he boils              ka""-yaomi, ka""-ki, future, past
   ta""-mi, he licks              ta""t-si, ta""-ti, future, imperative
   ce""-ce, (wind) blows          ce""-yaomi, ce""i-ki, future, past
   ka""-ci, he hears              ka""-si, ka""-ta, future, past
   This group is not very common, is generally intransitive, and is
found prevailingly with -cv and -sv indefinites, occasionally with -mi.
An inorganic -l- often occurs in the future.
   2. c+vv.
   ca""i-se, he jumps out         ca'e'-si, ca""i-ki, future, past
   co'i-ce, it is burnt          coi-ya'omi, co'i-ki, future, past
   cu'i-mi, he throws            cu'i-si, cu'i-ta, future, past
   k-u'i-se, he runs             k*u'e-si, k-u'e-ki, future, past
   (ma)p.a'i-mi, he kicks        (ma)pa't-si, (ma)po'l-ki, future, past
   (me)tca'i-mi, he rolls        (me)tca'i-tsi, (me)tca'i-ti, future, imperative
   na-u'-mi, he makes fun of     na'u-esi, na'u-ta, future, past
    It is somewhat difficult to decide whether in these forms we are
dealing with examples of a vowel elision that has become generalized
for all tenses, in other words, instances of types 6 and 7 where -e- has
74         University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.      [Vol. 27been lost on the analogy of the indefinite, or with old diphthong stems
connected with durative and semi-passive aspect. The second inter-
pretation is by far the more likely. Whether however we are to regard
these diphthongs as ultimately secondary in origin, i.e., consisting of
stem vowel plus -i durative and -u semi-passive, or simply as vowel
mutations to express aspect, must remain an open question.

     (ma)tu'l-mi, he penetrates          (ma)tu'l-esi, (ma)tu'l-ti, fut., imp.
    All the above forms either end in functional aspect suffixes (-c, -1)
or in petrified suffixes (-n, -p); the latter however are rare. Are we to
regard these forms, in consequence, as merely special developments
of c+v formula or as verbs that have lost terminal vowel? The future
has a weak vowel but all futures have such a vowel and in many cases
it is inorganic. Having due regard to the meaning of the verbs of this
class which is often strictly comparable to stems of c+v formula, they
can be best understood as variants of c+v stem.
    All these verbs seem to take their indefinite in -mi. This may be
due to the fact that indefinites in sv and -cv would merge with final
-s and -c and would tend to develop a weak inorganic vowel after
final -1, -n. On the other hand, -mi may have been preferred in order
to prevent the confusion that would have resulted between the indefi-
nite and the future had -sv or -cv been frequently suffixed. Some such
phonetic-morphological reason has probably been at work, for the
significance of the verbs themselves would not account for the prefer-
ence of -mi.

19299]           Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                   75     Most of the verbs of type 1 belong to this group. In spite of their
number, however, probably many are historically secondary in origin,
consisting of an old monosyllabic stem (c+v) with the addition either
of a petrified aspect suffix or of an aspect suffix still functional. The
former, on the whole, decidedly predominate so that whatever may
have been their ultimate origin, they are now felt as integral portions
of the stem. This is further emphasized by the fact that vowels of
various timbre always follow this apparently petrified or functional
suffix and that when the tense-aspect affixes (-mi, -sv, -cv) are added it
is always to the vowels. Of still greater importance is the fact that
practically all the vowel thematic indefinites belong here and when it
is remembered that one-sixth of all the verbs in the language form their
indefinites in -i, whether we regard this -i as the mutated original vowel
or not, we must, for all practical purposes, call it part of the stem. We
may therefore confidently postulate stems of the form c+v+c+v for
a very old period of the language. Some of these, many perhaps, are
of great antiquity but secondary, others belong to the very oldest
strata of Wappo and Yukian, for not all -1, -t, -p, etc., need necessarily
be identical with old petrified or still functional suffixes nor need all -i
represent mutated vowels. The existence of the stem form c+v+c+v
is of far-reaching significance both for a proper understanding of the
Yukian stock and for its relation to other languages and that is why we
have given so much space to proving it.
    It is noticeable that very few of these indefinites take -sv or -cv
and also form regular futures and pasts. There are probably not more
than half a dozen in the whole language. The reason is simple enough.
The vast majority of indefinites of the form c+v+c+v have an
irregular future-past, and since the increment future and increment
past stems are connected with aspects, we have here an additional
proof of the definitely felt force of -St and -cv. This incidentally also
indicates that -mi is not any longer felt to possess any meaning except
that of an indefinite tense, an interpretation abundantly borne out
in other ways.
    5. v+v.
   i'u-mi, he moves              i'u-si, i'u-ki, future, past
     Only one example of this formula was found. However if we include
those with irregular future-pasts the number can be slightly increased,
e.g., a'o-, to be hidden, u'i-tE, to be taken out. They are really stems
consisting of a single vowel, the second vowel being of secondary
origin. It is possible that they began with an initial h- now lost.
76         Utniversity of California Publioation in Am. Arch. and Ethn.       [VoL 27     6. v+c+v.
     a's-a, he gives                  a/si-si, a'si., future, imperative
     e'lu-sa, he keeps hold           e'lu-si, future
     i'li, he binds                   i'le-i, future
     O'tt-ci, he sucks                o'tL-si, o'tt-ta, future, past

     (me)'u'ti, he puts on top        (me)'u'te-si, (me)'u'te-ta, future, past
    Possibly a few more verbs of this form might be obtained from
those beginning with initial prefix o- and from those with irregular
future-past, but even then their number is inconsiderable. It is however
quite likely that a number of verbs have lost an initial vowel so that
it is probable that more examples of this form existed at a former
time. On the other hand it is also conceivable that most of the verbs
that originally possessed an initial vowel, now lost, belonged not to a
v+c+v stem but to a v+c+v+c stem, of which there are at present
no well-authenticated examples at all.
    The distinct impression conveyed by the examples given above is
that they are all secondary in origin, some being expansions of a single
vowel stem, others developments of the forms v+c or c+v.
    The very meager development of verbs beginning with a vowel
seems to point to a fairly old tendency of Wappo to slur original vowels.
This is apparently not a general Yukian trait because Yuki appears to
have a considerable number of such verbs.

     ts'a'lel-se, it wilts             ts's/lel-si, ts's'lel-ki, fut., past
   If we include stems with irregular future-past, the number of verbs
belonging to this group is really quite considerable. They are all,
however, secondary expansions of the c+v+c+v formula as is quite
evident from the frequency of -4 as final consonant.
   8. Irregular formations.
   Two slight irregularities occur in verbs of type 1. The future of
c+v+c forms have an inorganic -e or -L after the last consonant and
1929]               1adin: A0Grammar of the Wappo Language                           77the past in -ta frequently causes the elision of the terminal vowel
of the stem. This is probably due to the ruling analogy of the increment
forms in -te- and the influence of indefinites with elided vowels.
    No additional examples of futures with inorganic vowel are needed.
Many are quoted in the previous sections. A few instances of irregular
pasts in -ta follow:
   a's-ta, he gives                  a's-a, a'si-si, indefinite, future
   e'l-ta, he kept hold of           e'lu-sa, e'lu-si, indefinite, future

   mute'-se, it smoulders            mut'i'e-si, mut'i'e, fut., imp.
   mut'i'-mi, he lights
    Since many verbs of type.5, 6, and 7 really exhibit the same phenom-
enon they ought, strictly speaking, to be included here, thus making
this the largest irregular group in the language.
    If only a weak -e had been elided it might have been put down to a
possible error in recording, but the elision of -a definitely excludes
this possibility. The syncope of -a might be ascribed to the influence
of the durative suffixes -sv and -cv as previously suggested. This would
not however account for the loss of -a before -mi or that of -e before
both. It is therefore probably more reamonable to assume that purely
phonetic causes were at work and that the original -a of many indefi-
nites became reduced to -e for accentual reasons and then disappeared
entirely. The vast majority of indefinites that show syncope of vowel
take -sv or -cv, only a very few having -mi.
    That -a or -e are not part of the original stem wherever they occur
as second members of a diphthong seems fairly certain. The meaning
78         University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27of these verbs justifies us in regarding this -a and secondary -e as the
petrified causative suffix. Where however -a occurs alone (oli'ts-a,
hoka'm-a, mape'k-a, etc.), this explanation does not always hold. It
may hold in the case of ma-pe'k-a, where -pa- is foot, -k petrified suffix,
and -a petrified causative, but not for many others. The -a of oli'ts-a,
hoka'm-a, is consequently to be regarded as original.
    Related forms like honi'-e-l and mani'-a indicate how easily -a lost
its timbre. Indeed the change of a> e and E > a is one of the striking
peculiarities of the language.
    Type 3.-The vast majority have the stem formula c+v+c+v, a
few v+c+v and c+v.
    1. Indefinites in -sv, -cv.
     &'t-i-se, he drowns                      &'t-a-si, future

     huyE'ke-se, he is glad                   huye'ka-si, future
     kat'i'-se, he twists                     kat'a'-si, future
     ka-'V.a-ce, he laughs                    ka-'t'i-ce, future
     k-u'pi-se, it is rotten                  k*u'pa-ke, future
     (ma)a'pa-se, he carries up               (ma)a'pa-si, future
     ts'ilu'-ce, he is unwilling              ts'ila'-si, future
     ptti'-se, he takes                       ptta'-se, future
     (te)la'-se, (fish) run                   (te)la'-si, future
     tce'te-se, he twists                     tceta-Ja'si, future
     (me)le'pi-se, he is exhausted            (me)le'pa-si, future
     k'o'pi-ce, it thaws                      k'a'pa-si, future
    The past stem is identical with that of the future.
    There can be no question but that the future in many of these cases
contains the true, and the indefinite contains the mutated stem. This
is shown by the unanimity with which the past agrees with the future.
On the other hand phonetic considerations have, at times, led to sec-
ondary changes in the latter so that it can be said that this stem too
does not correspond to the true root. Indefinites in -ca, for instanep,
seem to preserve original -a, the vowel of the future in these cases
being reduced as in regular stems. Similarly the -i of u'tsitsi is original
(u'tci, night). The original vowel of monosyllabic stems (a')ti, o'ta,
(te)la', (te)la' is probably preserved in neither form. Such variations
as u'tu, u'tai, (te)la', (te)la', and probably o'tti, o'tta, (ma)a'pa, (ma)a'pa
1929]              Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                           79are all mutations of original vowel to indicate aspect, which have been
secondarily preserved in the future.
    Practically every vowel is found in the indefinite forms (a, e, i, a, u)
and only two in the futures (a, l). This greater variability of the indefi-
nites we have seen is due to the preservation of original -a and original
-e. The -u in ts'i'l-u-ce he'w-u-se is passive, and -i is the intransitive
and durative formative.
    2. Vowel mutation of indefinites in -mi of type 1.
    I am mentioning them here again to point out briefly the difference
between the pseudo-ablaut series found here and the true ablaut series
found in type 3.
    (mana)ca'tu-mi, he pares off                (mzna)ca'tc-si, future
    ma'na-mi, he hides                          ma'na-ki, past
    mu'ku-ki, he lies                           mu'ka-si, future
    pa'lL-mi, he makes deer drive               pa'le-si, future
    patco'to-mi, he wrinkles                    patco'te-si, future
    In all these cases purely phonetic considerations-the influence of
m, k, u and a-have given the unstable terminal vowel an -u, -o, -a
timbre. mu'k-u-ki, may however simply be the passive form of mu'ki-ce.
    Type 4.-These are all secondary c+v+c+v stems although appear-
ing in the indefinite as c+v.
    (o)ha""-mi, he fans                          (o)ha'he-si, future
    (o)hi""-mi, he buries                        (o)hi'he-si, future
    (o)ke""-mi, he lies down                     (o)ke'ht-si, future
    (o)tco""-me, he falls down                   (o)tco'ha-si, future
    (hu)na""-se, he carries on shoulder          (hu)na'ha-si, future
    mat""-se, it smoulders                       maha'-si, future
    t'u""-ci, it leaks                           t'u'ht-si, future
    This is a fairly extensive group, in reality a special case of syncope
of terminal vowel. The past behaves quite irregularly sometimes fol-
lowing the future, more often, however, the indefinite. Indefinites
in -i, -a are absent.
    For the most part it can be assumed that this -hv- is identical with
petrified causative -a. The meaning of the verbs and the occurrence of
the same stem, without -hv, seems to bear this out. This will not,
however, account for all cases. For instance, ha'he I prefer to regard
as reduplication and in (hu)na'he- it is actually the stem itself that is
elided, *he being the root of the verb ""to carry."" -hv- seems to have
been retained in a number of verbs, e.g.:
    (tu)ke.'hi, he rakes; nu'he, he is jealous; (me)ne'he, he takes food out of
ground; (ma)tca'ht-mi, he puts down; (ma)li'hi, he pokes; lu'hi, he plucks off;
(hu)so'ha-k, it is ended; (hu)cu'ha-iya, it steams; (hu)ke'hi, he shoves; (hopa)
t'o'he, he fights to kill; ce'ha-sa, he hits with arrow; (o)ce'ha-sa, he guesses.
80         Univer8ity of Califomnia PubUcations in Am. Arch. and Ethn. [VoL 27    Most of the examples with retained -hv- have indefinites in thematic
vowel, thus suggesting that -hv- was regularly elided before the.tense-
aspect suffixes -mi, -sr, -ct. The reason for the behavior of the past
tense -ta and -ki is not clear. Phonetically the problem had perhaps
better be posited in another way, namely, not why the aspect indefinites
and the past have elided -hv- but why the future and imperative have
preserved it, and this admits of an answer (§§68, 70, 71).
    Type 5.-These are all c+v+c+v stems appearing as c+vv.
    1. Without increments.
     (o)he'i, he sharpens                   (o)he'ye-si, future

     (ho)wa'i-sa, he forbids                (ho)wa'iye-si, future

     (me)tc'u'i-se, he gets up from bed      (me)tc'u'yel-si, future
     (na)mo'i-se, it itches                  (na)mo'iyel-si, future
    We are dealing here apparently with the syncope of -e and vocal-
ization of y to i, to judge by the future and imperative. In all likeli-
hood, however, the e' is merely reduced -a, preserved in a few futures,
barring a few exceptions. This *-ya is the auxiliary verb ""to go"" that
has become fused to many stems. In those cases where the future
shows that we are dealing with a true diphthong this is to be regarded
as a vowel mutation expressing aspect (hai, let-, wai-, moi-).
    Type 6.-Only c+v+c+v occurs, although c+vv in the indefinite
in the form.
     ci'u-mi, he whistles                   ci'w&-si, future
     hi'u-mi, he shakes                     hiwe'-si, future
     (home)le'u-si, he swings               (home)le'wt-si, future
     (ma)ki'u-mi, he stretches              (ma)ki'wt-si, future
     (ma)li'u-si, he comes and helps        (ma)li'wa-se, future
     (ma)t'o'u-mi, he knocks                (ma)t'o'we-si, future
     (te)li'u-se, he pursues                (te)li'wa-ki, future
    This is not a numerous group, because most verbs in -wv have
thematic vowel indefinites. The elision of the vowel -e (reduced -a)
and -a is again connected with the tense-aspect suffixes. The -wv itself
is unquestionably the petrified suffix -wa. The pasts in -ta are irregular

apply here likewise.
    Type 7.-Apparently the three forms of the stem found represented
are c+v, c+v+c, and c+v+c+v.

   k*u'-ki, he stands                     ku'hel-si, future
    Vowel-thematic indefinites are rare and it can be said that the
characteristic indefinite is either -se or -ce. The -1- increment while
devoid of any specific meaning now had unquestionably a plural force
at one time, and some verbs still form their plural in this manner
(cf. §85). There seems little doubt but that at one time -1- was as
regularly suffixed to the indefinite as to the future and preterit but
was then displaced by usitative and durative -se and -ce or lost entirely,
just as it is practically slowly disappearing from the future-preterit.
It is perhaps best preserved in the imperative where it was protected
by the imperative plural suffix -mi. However, it, is not infrequently
preserved in the imperative singular even in cases where it is lost in
the indefinite, future, and preterit.
    -1- regularly reduces the terminal vowel of the stem to -e-.
    Type 8.-In the main the formulae c+v and c+v+c+v are found.

82        University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27    Of the increment forms -te- is by far the best preserved,, owing
undoubtedly to the influence of nominal plural -te. It occurs with
indefinites of all types although -ce and -se predominate. Its original
force, now entirely lost with those futures and preterits that take it
regularly, was iterative and plural. As in the case of -4- it was certainly
extensively used for the indefinite at one time, but was displaced by
-cc and possibly by -se, or lost entirely as shown by the large proportion
of thematic vowel indefinites.
    With but a few exceptions -te- regularly causes the loss of terminal
vowel of disyllabic stems (c+v+c+v).
    As in the case of -1-, -te- is frequently preserved in both the imper-
ative singular and plural. It is even possible that the imperative in -ti
is really a variant of -te- (cf. §71). Even if -ti is unconnected, its gen-
eralization as the regular imperative singular suffix was quite likely
due to the influence of this old -te-.
    Types 9, 10, 11.-There are too few cases to determine whether
any particular formula was more characteristic than another.
   e 'na-me, he is afraid                    C 'nestc-si, future
   hlnpi'kali, he is sleepy                  htnpi'kalcste-si, future

   ts'i'mi-ya, he carries etc.               ts'i'mik-yaomi, future
    The future-preterit is a secondary formation in all these cases.
The -s- of -ste is of course durative. In all probability the indefinites
of ('name, hLnpi'kali, and ho-e'wuce had an -s- which has either been
lost or displaced.
    The -k- of -kte- is petrified suffix -k, meaning unknown. However
I place no great value on either the forms of types 10 or 11. They
may be special forms and not really regular futures.
    Type 12.-All formulae are represented: c+v, c+v+c, c+v+c+v,
c+v+v. The frequency of c+v+v is quite striking. c+v+c is rare.
     (ho)pe""-se, he looks around             (ho)pC'helek-si, future

    -lek- has no influence upon the vowel of the stem in marked contrast
to -1- and -te. Not only is the stem kept quite intact but indefinites
in ' regularly expand to -he-. The -k is inferential and the original
force of -lek was probably conditional or subjunctive. The -k was
unquestionably added after -1- had ceased to be suffixed to the inde-
finite. Why it has become the regular future-preterit of so many verbs
is not at all clear The best explanation is that it was at one time
associated with indefinites in -le-se or le-ce and, as it would have been
difficult to keep it apart from the future, the regular future was dis-
placed by the special future-conditional or subjunctive.
    There is today no tendency for -lek- to be associated with any
particular type of indefinite.
     Type 1S.-The formula is prevailingly c+v+c+v:
   (ho)le'i-ya, he runs                       (ho)le'omak-si, future
   (me)le'pi-ya, he gets up                   (me)le'pumak-si, future
   (me)ma'ni-ya, he picks up                  (me)ma'numak-ta, past
   (ma)we'mi-ya, he picks up long object      (ma)we'mok-si, future
   (me)ka'li-ya, he picks up                  (me)ka'lmok-si, future
   (me)ka't'i-ya, he picks up                 (me)ka't'tmak-si, future
   (napi)ca'li-ya, he whispers                (napi)cY'limak-si, future
   (tc.a)wa'li-ya, he dodges                  (tc.a)wa'lumak-si, future
     This form is strictly parallel to -lek-. -k is inferential. -mak is
still extensively used. It has probably become idiomatically fused with
the regular future of certain verbs for the same reasons as -lek-. The
indefinites certainly once had -ma, thus making confusion with the
future quite frequent. -(i)ya for these indefinites is secondary.
    -mak probably has no influence upon the terminal vowel of the
stem. If the future forms seem to indicate such an influence, this is
due to the fact that the indefinites in -(i)ya, all have -i-, probably
secondary in most cases. The stem as it appears in the future is nearer
the true form than that of the indefinite.
     Type 14.-There are too few instances to permit of any formulae
being selected as dominant.
     (na'a)t'-Yo-mi, he fills up              (na'a)t'1aVc-ki, past
     (na'a)tc.ai'-i-ce, it has pleasant taste (na'a)tc-ai'-iytc-ki, past
   pt'ti-ca, he has diarrhoea                 pL'tLc-ki, past
   ti'ya-ca, he is thirsty                    ti'y,c-ki, past
84         University of CalUfornia Publications in A-m. Arch. and Ethn.   [VoL 27   There is always the possibility that the pasts given are not the
regular ones although a strong presumption exists that they are.
That there ever were many verbs that showed this irregularity is
doubtful for, in the main, verbs in -c- preserved the -c- in all forms.
    Type 15.-c+v+c+v and c+v+v are the prevailing formulae.

     we'ela-sa, he pulls off                  we'els-ta, past   Some of these pasts are not the regular but the usitative pasts.
The loss of -s- in the indefinite is probably just as rare as the loss of -c-.
   Type 16.-The prevailing formula is naturally c+v+c+v. How-
ever c+v+c also occurs.
     (ome)ta'tt-si, he touches                (o'me)tate'-si, future

     ya'el-si, he climbs                      yaele'-si, future
    The apparent shift of accent seems clearly due to necessity of
keeping indefinite and future apart. Whether however ""the shift"" was
originally developed for this particular purpose or whether-which is
far more likely-it was formerly connected with all futures, it is, as
before indicated, difficult to say. The forms ho'metele'si, koce'si,
yaele'si are of considerable interest, because the accented -e- appears
as secondary and inorganic. Certainly -tel- and yael never ended in a
vowel. These forms definitely suggest that the future suffix is not -si
but -vsi.

   t'o'lta-sa, he catches in net               t'o'lt&s-ta, past
    These verbs simply show how the causative conjugation has second-
arily become the regular conjugation in a few instances. Of interest
is the fact that while the past -tLsta regularly appears, the present
-tasa is at times dropped (oli'ts-mi, mapa'ki, o't.asa).","[80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"
"    The above classification into seventeen types is one based on phonetic
considerations. In order to understand fully the irregularities of the
verb, another grouping is necessary, one based on the specific suffix
used in the formation of the indefinite tense-aspect; and to this we
shall now turn.
                               §§54-64. CLASSES
                             §54. Introduction
    Wappo may be said to have eight, strictly speaking only six, conju-
gations or classes. While in one way any arrangement into classes is
artificial, in another it seems to correspond to the historical fact that
each independent tense-aspect was correlated with a different method
of forming the future-past. Today this still holds for four of the groups.
The original eight classes were probably the following:
                Indefinite         Future              Past
           1    thematic vowel     -si              -ta, -ki
           2    -mi                -18i (?          -ta, -lki (?)
           3    -la, -li           -leksi           -lekta, -lekki (lEki)
           4    -ma, -ma           -maksi           -makta, -mokki (maki)
           5    -ca                -csi (si)        -cki,-cta
           6    -ce                -tesi            -teki, -teta (ta)
           7    -se                -si (Si)         -sta, -ski
           8    -ki                -Si              -ki
    Today 2 has become merged with 1; the future-past of 3 has lost
special association with any particular indefinite suffix; 5 and 7 have,
for the main part, become fused with 6 and 1; and the -ma indefinite
of 4 has given place to -ya. We have thus really left four classes:
           1. thematic vowel, -mi; -Si; -ta, -ki.
           2. -ce, -ca, -ee; -tesi; -tcki.
           3. -ya;m-ksi;-mkkta.
           4. -ki; -8i; -ki.
86       University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [VoL 27     I do not mean to imply that -mi forms do not at times take a future
in -tesi, etc., for today everything is in a considerable state of flux,
but a glance at the dictionary will show that this' fourfold grouping
does hold.
     Let us now return to our original eight classes.
     -mi probably lost its significance as aspect at a very early period
and began to displace the thematic vowel indefinites. This must have
occurred before the periphrastic class developed. Otherwise it would
be difficult to understand why it did not fall together with -ma, -ma.
     -la, while still surviving in some verbs, seems to have disappeared
early, due probably to two factors, its erroneous analysis into -1 plus
vowel, which would place it in the first class, and the ease with which
it was confused with the imperative and the semi-passive. The analysis
into 1 plus vowel has given rise to the not infrequent disyllabic and
trisyllabic stems in 1 plus e. In the texts indefinites in -li are not
uncommon.
     By this loss of specific reference to certain classes the -1- and -lek-
increment futures and pasts became free to associate themselves with
any of the indefinites.
     What may possibly also have led to the loss of -la is the increment
-lek- itself. This is composed of -Ie- and -k inferential and is today
still extensively used as a subjunctive. -la never had this force.
     -ma, -ma has held its own much better than -la. It probably gave
way to -ya because like -la it could be confused with so many other
suffixes that were phonetically identical.
     -ca was probably always rare. It is the inchoative suffix. On the
other hand that it too was felt as c plus vowel and thus often confused
with conjugation 1, I have little doubt.
     -cc is not to be confused with -ca. It is an entirely different element,
namely the durative-usitative suffix. This is a very old class, probably
as old as the disappearance of the -te- in the indefinite.
     -se like -la seems to have been analyzed into s plus vowel and
brought into class 1. The large number of stems in -s suggests this
very definitely.
     For -ki indefinite two explanations are possible, either the indefinite
forms have been lost or it has been incorrectly analyzed into stem
plus ki instead of into a k- auslaut stem' with thematic vowel, thus
making it originally identical with the first class. I strongly incline to
the second interpretation, for the disappearance of the indefinite tense
is not very likely to have occurred often.
1929]               1.9adin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                    87   Turning now to the question of the best practical method of presenta-
tion of the many irregularities, we have for the sake of clarity made a
grouping into eight classes, each class having a number of sub-types.
They are not real conjugations as the original eight classes were.

    These eight classes are found distributed among the seventeen
types of stem-formation in the following fashion. Class 1 is found
mainly in type 1, with a few examples in types 2-6, absent in type 16,
and exceedingly rare in the others. Class 2 is fairly common in types
1 and 5, absent in types 2 and 16, very rare in 3, 4, 5, 6, rare in 7-17.
Class 3 is common in types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6; uncommon in 2; and rare in
the others. Class 4 is exceedingly common in types 7-17 and frequent
in all the others. Class 5 occurs in all types except 3 and 16. Naturally
all the increment types except -mok- are excluded. Class 6 is common
in type 1 and rather rare in all the others. It does not occur at all in
types 2, 3, 5, and 7-17.
    The present distribution of verbs among the eight classes gives
234 for class 1, 164 for class 2, 146 for class 3, 209 for class 4, 123 (pro-
visional) for class 5, 34 for class 6, and the remaining 58 (?) for classes
7 and 8. It therefore cannot be said that of the four main classes any
one is really dominant. My impression is that classes 1 and 4 are
displacing the others, that in class 2 the indefinite tense is developing
into a participial-absolute form, that class 3 is disappearing, and that
classes 5 and 6 are being extended.
    Class 1. Subtypes 1 and -2.-Subtype 1 represents the strictly regular
method of conjugation. Some of these verbs can also take a past in
-ki, i.e., they still preserve what was probably the old distinction
between -ta and -ki, simple past and responsive past. The imperative
is always -ti.
1929]              1Badin: A Grammar of. the Wappo Language                        89   The only difference between subtype 1. and 2 is in the imperative.
Here subtype 2 is older. It is not very common.
   Examples,36 subtype 1:
    ocu'tumi, extinguish fire; oha""mi, fan; ohi""mi, bury; oka'lemi, hang.
    Examples, subtype 2:
    oi'semi, dig for water; oli'tsmi, fill up; ot.a'pmi, stab; ha'limi, drive animals.
    Subtype S.-These form their parts in -ki. The imperative is uncer-
tain but probably -ti. This -ki today has become associated with
intransitive and neuter verbs, with paives, and with transitives
without object. It is probably for some such reason that -ki has dis-
placed -ta entirely. Verbs like ho'ts'ami, kill, ho'ts*aplmi, break, used
intransitively, either use another verb for the transitive (t'o'ta, he
killed) or a special construction like the causative (hots.a'p&ttsta, he
broke). Not many verbs belong to this group.
    hots*a'pLmi, break round object; ho'ts-ami, kill; otca""me, fall down; hoki'tumi,
turn around.
    Subtypes 4-7.-Only comparatively few verbs are found here for
class 1 is, on the whole, not addicted to increment expansions of stem
even secondarily except -c- and -s-.
    ko'mi, put beads on; ku'pmi, soak; mahu'mi, bet; napi'cu'mi, rub sticks;
e'name, be afraid.
    hLntco""me, dream, huwa'omi, stick out; p'i'umi, skin; na'&'t'aomi, fill up;
ha'mi, pull1.
   The imperative is irregular, sometimes having -ti and sometimes
the future-past base, very rarely -e.
   Class 2. Subtype 1.-The indefinite is probably a present tense-
ending fused with an original terminal vowel. -ki is practically never
used even to form a secondary past tense, its place being taken by a
rather recent formation, the proclitic u. Imperatives are always -e.
    i'li, bind; o-e'li, dig out; oci'pi, sew: ohe'i, sharpen; ohi'li, build.
    Subtype 2.-This is a rare but extremely interesting group. The
indefinite is apparently the stem, very likely with reduced terminal
vowel. Probably to avoid confusion, the imperative suffixed -ti, -i, or
was entirely irregular. It forms no -ki pasts.
    opa't'e, shout; otaohe, kill (with irregular imperative); ha'e, say (irregular
imperative); ha""e, bark; hoka'le, stretch.
    Subtypes 3 and 4.-Indefinites in -a are very rare today and extremely
irregular. They were clearly more frequent at one time, to judge from
    ' I only give the indefinite. The other tenses will be found in the dictionary.
90         University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.        [Vol. 27the fairly large number of -la, -sa, -ca forms where the -a of the suffix
is the same element. Like -e it is probably the original terminal vowel
of the stem. Why the imperative should be -i, especially when this
gives rise to homonyms with the future, is not clear. -ta is generally
the past, -ki occurring sporadically.
    a's-a (a's-sa?), give; ha'ta, know; ka't'a, be mouldy; me'waya, muss up;
ta""osa, tell untruth; mai""oket*a, be lean.
    Subtypes 5, 6, 7.-These are as rare as the increment forms in class
1. -te- of course takes a past in -ki but strangely enough -lek- also
appears with a past in -ki. The imperatives are irregular.
    oka'li, talk; cu'tui, hang on; ha'mi, pull; k*e'li, eat mush; k'i'ni, open; k'o'yi,
knead.
    Class 3. Subtypes 1 and 2.-We find here the same division as in
class 1, subtypes 1 and 2, a fairly large class that only take a past in
-ta or in -ta and -ki, and an equally large class that take a past in -ki.
The imperative in subtype 1 is -e and in subtype 2 uncertain but
probably -e. Apparently no example of -ti imperative is found. The
verbs with -ki past are practically universally intransitive. The inde-
finite in -sa, with old -a, probably preserved to avoid confusion with
future.
    Examples, subtype 1:
     cu'kaltsi, drag; homepu'ttsi, stir up; homete'lsi, flatten; home-tc'o'lsi, knock;
hopi'hisi, shake; hopi'hiwesi, squeak; oce'hasa, guess; ce'hasa, hit with arrow.
    Examples, subtype 2:
     at'i'se, drown (intransitive); oha'wesi, bet; omoti'se, overflow; omv'kise, lie;
opt'tclsi, break; u""klttsi, be drunk; ome'isa, be wet.
    Subtypes 3, 4, and 5.-Increment futures and pasts are not rare in
this group although limited to -el- and -s- in the main. The important
-te- and -lek- increments are entirely absent with few exceptions.
-mak- is quite uncommon. The latter might perhaps best be regarded
as a variety of class 2, subtypes 3 and 4. It is characterized by the
imperative in -i and its identity form with the future.
    O'ise, move gently; onana'pise, graze; hi'nasa, get there; hono'mese, travel;
homa's-asa, miss; honi'se, ride in boat; hope""se, look around; huna-tsa'se, yawn;
mepu'lsi, bubble; pika'hasa, squeak; pitsa'pise, mash.
    Class 4. Subtypes 1 and 2.-Neither of these types is very common,
for class 4 is preeminently the ""increment"" group. These are probably
all verbs that have but recently been included in this class owing to
the extension of -ce. They probably belonged to class 2 formerly.
1929]              9adin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                            91    Examples, subtype 1:
    otsa'ice, tip over; u'kce, drink; ha/ice, shoot arrow; howa'lce, wish for.
    Examples, subtype 2:
    oka'ce, answer; ce""ce (wind) blows; ca/ice, be burnt; hote""-ce, melt.
   Subtype S.-This subtype really represents an old conjugation-class.
Most of the verbs with future-past increments in -te- belong here.
The past is -ki in all cases, -ta having contracted with -te- and then lost.
While the imperative in -te is still preserved in some cases, it is in the
main on the verge of extinction. Apparently it could not compete with
imperative -ti.
     'Ilice, dig hole; i'wuce, move; hi'uce, rock; hoe'wuce, be ignorant of; hoka'nice,
carry round objects; huku'ice, bump head; ka""ce, get hurt.
    Subtypes 4 and 5.-Future increments in -el- are probably as fre-
quent as those in -te-. -lek-, likewise, is not uncommon, for class 4 has
attracted to itself all the increments except -mak. Subtype 4 has both
*ki and -ta in the past although the latter is rare. The imperatives are
uncertain. However both -1 and -la are not infrequently found.
    Examples, subtype 4:
    ct'tsce, be wet; ha'nce, groan; htnka/tece, snore; homu'ice, think; hote'ice,
hover; huka'lice, think.
    Examples, subtype 5:
    otc-u'lce, lie on one's side; ha'kuce, be hungry; hutsi'wice, smile; nahe'tsice,
kneel.
    Subtypes 6 and 7.-Two distinct suffixes are involved here, -ci
variant of -ce corresponding to -se, -si, -e, -i, and -ci inchoative (rare).
-ki appears as the past of most verbs. The imperative is irregular and
uncertain.
   ate'wtci, be dead; ohu'pLci, dive in water; otst'ptci, paint red; ka""ci, hear;
ke'leci, be ashamed; ka""ci, boil; ka'ltci, flow down.
     Subtypes 8 and 9.-Here again we have two distinct suffixes, -ca
analogous to -sa, -a (rare) and -ca inchoative. The latter always has
a past in -ki (cki), the former in -ta. The imperatives are uncertain.
    e'laca, get deep; omica/iyaca, be hot; amo-u'tcuwa'ca, get dark; oke'l-aca, be
dumb; u'tuca, be deaf; ka'lica, ache; ku""ca, stink; nale""eca, be angry.
    Class 5. Subtypes 1 and 2.-Subtype 1 is not uncommon and is
irregular. It is difficult to decide whether the future-past has lost its
increment -mak- or whether it never had it. -ki appears as the past, -ta
92         UMversAty of Califoria PubUtioatow in Am. Arch. and Ethn.            [VoL 27being rare. The imperative is -ma. Subtype 2 is the remnant of the
old conjugation-class 4, the indefinite in -ma having been displaced
by -(i)ya. The imperative is irregular.
   Examples, subtype 1:
    omanots'e'wiya, be afraid; ho-e'wiya, be ignorant of; hoka'kaiya, crawl;
hucu'haiya, steam; pu'liya, run away.
     Examples, subtype 2:
    mawe'miya, pick up long object; mele'piya, get up; mema'niya, pick up;
meka'liya, pick up; meka't'iya, pick up; tc-api'kiya (irregular future); tc*awa'liya,
dodge.
    Class 6. Subtype 1.-This class and all its subtypes have only
intransitive and semi-passive verbs. The imperative is uncertain but
generally -i. The future and imperative thus frequently fall together.
     o'ntcki, be human; ocLka'ltk(i), be stingy; oli'tcaki, be full; ca'telki, be rough.
     Subtypes 2 and S.-Both subtypes are irregular because one would
naturally expect -teki and -lekta in the past. The imperative is un-
certain. Neither type is numerous, but -lek- is far commoner than
-te-. It contains some of the most important verbs in the language.
    ca'siki, sit down, cu'ttnki, stoop; ho'l*ki, stand; hona'nvk(i), be open; husa'-
hok(i), be ended; k.u'ki, stand; le'puki, stand; pici'uki, be cool.
    Class 7. Subtypes 1 and 2.-These are both rare and unimportant
groups, quite irregular and fragmentary. The -ma, -mo indefinite is
not to be regarded as a variant of -mi but a secondary recrudescence
of -mo.
     oka""ma, inform; ote""ma, spread; mewi'ma, go along.
    Subtype S.-The imperative excepted, this is the old conjugation-
class 4 that has survived with a few verbs.
     cep'uma, limp along; hoku'ytma, dive around.
    Class 8. Subtypes 1 and 2.-These are both fragmentary and
irregular types exceedingly rare. The first is possibly the remnant of
the old conjugation-class 3. I am not including verb-stems in terminal
-4 (c+v+c+v+c) although they possibly belong here (hoka'lela,
hoka'tala, homa'nala).
     okalai'yele, crawl; li'pele, kill manv.

                §64. Verbs with Double Forms for Tenses, etc.
    Forming a class by themselves are a number of verbs that allow
of more than one method of forming the different tense-aspects and
imperative. Extreme irregularity exists here and the various doublets
require separate explanations. That the same verb should have both
-ki and -ta in the past is merely the persistence of a trait that at one
time all verbs shared. That however a verb should have two ways of
forming the singular imperative, that the indefinite should end in both
a vowel and -mi, is a morphological phenomenon of an entirely different
order. That, finally, the same verbs should possess a simple and an
increment future and past, can be explained either on the assumption
that they have preserved an old characteristic once common to all
verbs, or that the increment forms are being displaced by the simple
ones.
    As we have evidence (sometimes unfortunately not quite clear),
indicating the former existence and present persistence of two forms
for each tense-aspect-a responsive and a direct-we must try to
separate these from the others. As far as could be ascertained these
are -ta direct-past, -ki responsive past; -si direct future, -yaomi and
possibly -1- increments, responsive futures. For the independent tense-
aspect no difference exists. Barring these, the doublets are to be inter-
preted as secondary extensions of one or the other suffix and as repre-
senting the first stages of the displacement of one by the other. Where
-ti and -e imperative exist, -ti is the secondary extension; where -mi
and thematic vowel indefinite are found, -mi is secondary; where -mi
and -cc, -se or -ya are encountered in the indefinite the latter are sec-
ondary; where increment and non-increment forms exist side by side
(-lek- and -mak- excluded), the former are primary.
    1. Verbs with doublet indefinites.
    ci'umi, ci'we, whistle; ok'o""ci, ok'a'atasi, k-o""tasi, boil (the last two forms
are causatives); omanots'e'wuce, omanots'e'wiya, be afraid; hano'mese, hono'mala,
travel; hoto'kse, hoto'kala, float; ma'nsi, ma'nala, carry flat object; mame'ce,
mame'sa, take home; mapika'ce, mapika'hasa, creak; mata'yese, mato'yala, wade;
mepu'lsi, mepu'laiya, mepu'lmi, be full; mo'n-ce, mo'nomi, h;de; tc-api""imi, tc.-
api""ici, take out; ts'e'se, ts'e'sasa, bathe; tcoho'tseli, tc-oho'tsesi, turn over;
tse'we, tse'usa, ask.
    It is easy enough to see what the difference in meaning originally
was, except in the case of -mi and thematic vowel indefinites. Today,
however, only -la, -vya and, at times, -se have a distinct force. The
preceding examples also give a fairly reliable indication of the manner
in which -se(si) is displacing the other suffixes.
94         Un versity of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.             [Vol. 27     2. Verbs with doublet pasts.

round object; kakima'ktsta, kakima'ke, hail; ka't'aki, ka't'tcki, be mouldy;

finite, the second past); tse'lke, tse'lekta, stay behind; tcu'htki, tcu'hittsta, blow
away, ikapo'teta, ikapo'telke, bother.
    The possibility of double formations in the past, considering the
large number of existing increments, many of which are still functional,
is of course greater than in the indefinite. In many of the examples
there is likewise a perceptible degree of difference in meaning. This
applies particularly to the -s- forms ma'wita, ma'wiski; ta'k-eki,
ta'kaista; tu'tsaki, tu'tstski; tse-'wki, tse'usta). The distinction between
non-increment and -1- increment forms, we have seen, is possibly that
between direct and responsive; and the difference between non-incre-
ment and -lek- increment, while lost now, can easily be imagined,
namely the contrast of simple with the inferential-conditional past.
pE'tsaki, pe'tsalEkta is very significant, for if the first is felt today as
simply the indefinite, it suggests what is normal enough in the history
of language, a secondary differentiation of what were felt to be identical
forms.
    The complete absence of doublets in -teki and -makta is rather sur-
prising. It is to be explained unquestionably by the fact that -te- has
retained a good deal of its old iterative-plural force and would therefore.
not appear in the singular of non-increment forms and that -mak- still
keeps its definitely progressive significance. The causative (-ttsta) is
really a method of forming transitives from intransitives.

"                         §75. Formation of Aspect
    Two types of aspect formation are found characterized respectively
by change of stem-vowel (terminal or basic) and consonantal ablaut,
or by special suffixes. True ablaut is no longer functional except in
one aspect, the responsive, in the passive voice, and in a few modes.
Its importance at one stage of the language clearly was very great.
The following aspects were expressed by this method.
    Intensive-by diphthongization of basic vowel.
    Miscellaneous activities-by various mutations of basic vowel.
110         University of California Publcations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.     [Vol. 27    Diminutive-by initial consonantal ablaut.
    Active intransitive, intransitive-impersonal, durative responsive-
by ablaut of terminal stem vowel.
    It is rather significant to note that of all these activities only one
is specifically expressed today, the durative, and this by a suffix.
    The second method, suffixation, is still extensively used. Of the
aspects found indicated by this method the most important are the
causative, continuative, iterative, durative, usitative, and progressive.
    Formation of causative.-The causative is expressed in five distinct
ways: by the suffixes -a or -ha, -sa, -tasa (-tasi, -ttsta) -mesi (mesta) and
a special conjugation (-si first person singular; -ti second person singular,
and -mi in the other persons). Of these -a (-ha) is no longer functional.
There are thus three distinct elements involved here -a, -sv- and -mesi,
all of which are probably old verb stems although only for -mesi can
this be definitely proved. Yuki has -si, -s but not the others. Yuki
possesses likewise a causative -ttl and this suggests that the -ta- in
Wappo -tasv- is also to be regarded as a distinct causative element.
In that case -tasv- can best be analyzed into -ta- causative and -s-
usitative and should be kept apart from -te- iterative and -ta- sub-
junctive.
    One is tempted to analyze -mesi into -me verbal stem ""to do"" and
usitative -s- but there is not sufficient evidence for this.
    a. Causatives in -sa.
    -sa can best be analyzed into -s- causative and -a active base theme.
It occurs mainly with stems that take -1- increment. It is not very
common. -Lsta is apparently the past tense. It is used idiomatically
with certain verbs.
    atetco'palasa, I'm making him warm; atetco'alasa, I'm making him sick;
apu'lasa, I'm about getting away (for I'm making myself run); ateyo'keltsta, I
made him get up; atehotco'eltsta, I made him walk; atehowa'laltsta, I made him
crawl; atehtnto'tsta, I made him sleep; atets'u'tststa, I made him sneeze; ateka'-
ptktsta, I made him cough; hmntco'htsta, I made him dream.
    It is not always easy to decide when we are dealing with an idiomatic
use of causative -sa, -si (s+si) zcsta and when with the usitative -s-.
The frequency of -sta as the past of verbs in -sa and its rarity with
verbs in -se, suggests that this may be the real difference between these
forms.
    z't-asa, o't-asi, o't-tsta, to suck breast; ohoi'tesa, ohoi'tesi, ohoi'teststa,
ohoi'tesi, to begin; ome'esa, ome'esi, ome'tsta, to feed; hi'nasa, hi'nasi, hi'ntsta,
to get there; homa's-asa, homa's-asi, homa's*ta, homa's-asi, to miss; mai'ots'i'lasa,

1929.]             Badin: lA Grammar of the Wappo Language                        illl    b. Causatives in -tasa (indefinite), -tasi (future), -ttsta (past), and
-tasi' or -ttsti (imperative).
    This forms a regular conjugation although -tasi' as imperative is
rather uncommon. A number of verbs appear only with these causa-
tive suffixes.
     atehutsa'tatasa, I'm making him well; atehutsa'tettsta, I made him well;
atehukL'tatasi, I'll make him drunk; atehukt'tattsta, I made him drunk; ca'itasa,
ca'itasi, co'tttsta, to scorch; mapu'latasa, mapu'latasi, to blow; mopu'letasi,
mopu'lettsta, to fill with air; patcoYtasa, patca'tasi, patco'ttsta, patco'ttsti, to
frighten; so'mitasa, sa'mitasi, saVmittsta, to spend; t'o'ltasa, t'o'lt&sta, to catch
in net.
    c. Causatives in -mesi (indefinite), -mesisi (future), mresta (past),
-mesti (imperative).
    These forms are practically restricted to adjectives. The indefinite
is rarely used, its place being taken by -si.
    tse'pi ca'iya ome'si', he makes it hot (here ome'si' is an independent verb):
tse'pi tca'ptsome'si, he is making it hot atsa'ts'ome'sta, I made it cold; aotsa'-
ts'ome'stsi, I will make it cold; mi-otsa'ts'ome'sti', make it cold!; mi-c'iyome'sti',
make it warm!; ate.'tcok'ome'stsi, I'll make him go (literally, I'll make him the
going).
    d. Causative conjugation (-si, -ti, -mi).
    This causative ""conjugation"" is utterly inexplicable. For a long
time I regarded it as due to some error either on my part or on that
of my informant, but the absolute consistency with which these forms
were' given again and again after long intervals of time precludes the
possibility of error. It must be pointed out, however, that apparently
no examples appear in the text. On the whole I am inclined to regard
this conjugation as a purely secondary development within Wappo
and not as a possible survival of pronominal suffixes.
    For the second point, namely, what these suffixes are in origin, I
can only suggest vague hypotheses. They occur only in the indefinite
and 'prevailingly with adjectives, although I suspect that the small
number of examples obtained where' they are used with verbs is acci-
dental. The series is as follows:
                            First singular -si.
                            Second singular -ti.
                            Third singular -mi.        -
                            Plural           -mi.
    One thing seems clear, namely that if -mi is the indefinite tense
suffix, it represents the only instance in which it is used with adjectives.
It is, indeed, extremely unlikely that we are dealing with -mi indefinite.
112        University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.         [VoL 27I am inclined to regard it as the original form of -me-si. This is, how-
ever, merely a guess. -ti second person naturally suggests the impera-
tive singular suffix and -si first singular, the regular causative. But
causative, imperative, indefinite suffixes all in one conjugation seem
quite ridiculous.
    aotsa'tstsi, I made it cold; miotsa'tstti, you made it cold; tsepi otsa'tstmi,
he made it cold; tsi otsa'tStmi, we made it cold; etc.
      Similarly are conjugated:
      acaiyosi, I make it hot; atu'tcesi, I enlarge it; aku'ttyesi, I make it small;
atetco'elasi, I make him sick; a'ok'e'nLsi, I make it long; a'omi'tesi, I make it
shorter; a'otu'tclsi, I make it large; a'otsa'ttsi, I make it cold; a'otco'ptsi, I make
it warm; a'mai'matsa'mMsi, I do it for myself; a'mai'homesa""wesi, I fix it for my-
self.
                     §76. Formation of the Responsive
    It is possible that the data obtained on this subject are not con-
clusive. The forms obtained suggest great irregularity.
    nako'teke, they bloomed (responsive); nako'telki, they bloomed (direct).
   ?mecu'teki, he grabbed (resp.); mecu'telke, he grabbed (ditiect).
    hote'peki, long objects lie (resp.); hote'pelki, long objects lie (direct); ote'puke,
         long objects lie (direct).
    nata'meki, they lie on stomach (resp.); nata'melki, they lie on stomach
         (direct).
    cuttne'ki, they stoop (resp.); cutrne'lki, they stoop (direct).
    su'teki, they stoop (resp.); su'tLlki, they stoop (direct).                          §77. -mele, -cele, -sele, -kele
     Few elements in Wappo are more difficult to ex'plain than these
very extensively used suffixes. That they are to be analyzed into
-mCe-, -ce-le, -se-le, -ke-le seems rather obvious. The first part of -cele
and -sele we can then equate with usitative and durative -c-, -s-. But
it is just here that our real difficulties begin. The usitative and durative
can be said to appear in two forms, as simple usitative and durative
infix -c-, -s- and as usitative and durative tense-aspect suffix -cv and
-sv. The first is historically much older than the second for Yuki
proper possesses the first but not the second, thus indicating that it is
secondary in Wappo. Since Yuki proper likewise has close parallels
to all four of our suffixes (-mil, -sil, -cil, -kil) we are quite justified in
regarding Wappo -mele, etc., as belonging to the same period as -c-
and -s-. That has a very important corollary for it allows us definitely
to exclude any possibility of -mele having arisen from -mi, or -me
indefinite tense, or that -kele has arisen from -ki past tense. Indeed
Yuki proper effectually disposes of any idea that -mi and -ki tense
1929]               1adin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                        113suffixes have anything to do with the -me- and -ke- of -mele, -kdle,
for there the corresponding Yukian forms actually follow each other
and are recognized as such:
    pimilmil, he played the flute (the first mil is Wappo -mele, the second Wappo
-mi); a-p cu'kik, I seat myself (the first k is Wappo -kc(kel), the second Wappo -ki).
    In Wappo the situation is not so clear for no such form as -melemdle
or -meme exist. -keke (-keki) is occasionally found in the texts although
these forms always puzzled my interpreter. In addition to -mil, -sil,
-kil Yuki proper has -til and -lil. The first occurs sporadically in Wappo
in the texts as -tel, the second is non-existent. -tel, -tele, and -4ele do
occur but in all cases they can be shown to consist of verb-stems ending
in -teand -le respectively to which -le is suffixed.
    Now with regard to the terminal -le, Yuki has a strictly comparable
-il for which however Kroeber39 could find no meaning. For Wappo
we certainly can remedy this defect for there it is manifestly the con-
tinuative and the plural (leaving aside for the time the question whether
the two are identical). In Wappo, however, we saw that -le in -mele,
-cele, -sele, -kele possesses a passive and semi-passive significance, a fact
that seemed to be borne out fairly convincingly by certain forms in
-la. Here Yuki proper helps us out considerably for there we find -lil
with a reflexive and reciprocal meaning. As we can analyze -lil into
-1- and -il it must evidently be the first that contains the reflexive-
reciprocal significance. This evidence consequently goes far toward
justifying the view that the -le of Wappo -mele, -cele, -sele, -kele has
nothing to do with the passive and that this passive type is to be
regarded as a transitive verb with plural subject. For further discussion
of passive -la, -le, cf. §39. Now, of the four forms, it is only -mele that
was extensively used as passive and if we look around in Yuki proper
for a suffix with which this -mele might be connected, we find one that
seems to fit our case, namely -mi defined by Kroeber as indicating
involuntary, inanimate actions and automatic motions, etc. Surely the
idea of indefinite subject might be added.
    A tabular presentation of the Yuki and Wappo forms will perhaps
make the above-remarks clearer:
                                          Yuki
-kil repeated action limited to single period.   -k unrepeated, instantaneous action.
-til causative, transitive.                      -1 intransitive, unintentional.
-sil general idea of motion.                     -is continuative, iterative.
-lil reflexive or reciprocal.
-mil meaning unknown.                            -m involuntary, inanimate actions.

clarified by Yuki -mil (meaning unknown) and Yuki -il is explaided by
Wappo -le. Finally Yuki -lil practically disposes of the theory that any
passive force initially inhered in the second -1.","[118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123]"
"                       §14. Denominating Concepts
    The nominal stem appears in three varieties, as bare stem without
formative, as stem with formative, and as nominalized verb. All
relationship terms, the vast majority of body-part nouns, and a fair
number of names of articles, natural phenomena, etc., are unanalyzable
simple stems either monosyllabic (c+v, v+c, c+v+c) or polysyllabic
(c+v+c+v, c+v+c+v+c) in form. Not a few body-part nouns
are compounds (heart, eye) and some are even nominalized verbs
(throat). A large number of names of material objects, some natural
phenomena, and very many stems referring to animals are descriptive,
consisting of compounds of various kinds, nominalized verbs or occa-
sionally simply of an adverb used nominally (e.g., ne'wdla, tripe, which
is simply the adverb inside).
    The suffixed formatives, with a few exceptions, coincide in form
with suffixes denoting plurality, iteration, continuative, and durative
and had best be regarded as identical in origin with them although now
devoid of any well-defined meaning. A special formative for names of
trees exists. Numerals have a number of specific suffixes probably
adverbial in origin. Prefixes are not common. Of the few that occur
two are probably identical with the indefinite pronominal object of
verbs and a third seems a true nominal sign.
    A large number of local and instrumental notions are expressed by
true suffixes or semi-postpositions.
    In general it may be said today that far more nouns than verbs
are of purely secondary origin. This hardly seems likely to represent
the original condition and some explanation seems demanded. The
most likely one, bearing in mind what types of nouns represent nom-
inalized verbs or compounded forms, is that the custom of tabooing
the names of the deceased led to substitutions descriptive in character.
1929]           Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                  21                            §15. ClassiJication
    As mentioned before verbs use no suffixes or prefixes to indicate
the character of the object, employing for this purpose, whenever they
wish to express it, either distinct stems or, rarely, ablauted forms.
    The same holds true for the noun and pronoun except that very
recently, probably, a classification of nouns into human and non-
human has developed, the former being indicated by k-a-, a variant
form of the word for man, k-eo. A suffix indicating female gender is
found with certain relationship terms.
                              §16. iAumber
    Most verbs do not today, except in the imperative, indicate plurality.
Some do however, either by means of suffixes (-te-, -1-) or by irregular
formations. In the imperative there is a true plural and probably a
dual. There can be no question but that Wappo formerly expressed
plurality in the verb very generally and it is more than probable that
it distinguished between singular and plural subject and object.
    All nouns without exception express plurality by the suffix -te,
relationship terms often taking a reduplicated -tE (-tete).
    All pronouns express plurality but not by the same suffix as nouns.
The demonstratives indicate both plurality and duality.
    A number of verbs, two adjectives, and the relative pronoun indi-
cate plurality by complete change of stem.
                                §17. A spects
  X Aspect is probably the oldest and most fundamental conception
developed in connection with the verb. Terminal vowel ablaut and a
large number of suffixes and some prefixes are used to indicate it.
Formerly consonant and stem vowel ablaut were also employed. The
aspects expressed are unrepeated momentaneous action (stem as such),
iterative, distributive, repetitive, diminutive, continuative, discontinu-
ative, durative, usitative, causative, dubitative, and responsive.
                               §18. Voices
    Four voices seem to exist: active-transitive, inactive-intransitive,
passive and middle (semi-passive-reflexive). The first two are vestigial,
the last two functional and extensively used. Of these the passive is
formed in a number of ways (-u-, -uki, -ki, -mele, -cele, -sele) and the
middle by suffixation of -la, -le. Two passives are found, one expressing
definite, one indefinite agent.
    All four voices seem to be old formations.

                                §19. Modes
    The following modes are known: indicative, subjunctive, hortatory,
and imperative. Of these the subjunctive is formed in a variety of
definite ways and at times irregularly; the hortatory regularly, by
mutation of terminal vowel to -a- and the imperative by various
suffixes. In addition to the regular imperative a supplicative imperative
is found.
                                §20. Tenses
    Tenses occur in two forms, simple and periphrastic, the latter indi-
cated by affixed auxiliary verbs. There are really only two tenses,
a true future and a past. The latter falls into a direct-visible and
responsive-visible or invisible. An indefinite-present occurs but this
is essentially to be regarded as an aspect.","[29, 30, 31]"
"                  §97. Formation of the Subjective Case
    A few nouns mnake no change for the subjective case; the over-
whelming majority, however, do. Those ending in a consonant and
a few ending in a vowel add -i, a very few change terminal -E to -ayi,
-o dissimilates into -wi; two show metathesis, and two stem reduction.

               §98. Vocative, Possessive, and Oblique Cases
    Normally there is no change for the vocative, although a tendency
exists to shorten stems with terminal vowel and to use the subjective
form. A true vocative formed by suffixing -sta is used with relationship
terms but only when the people addressed are either far away or in-
visible. The meaning of -sta is not clear. It may be -s- usitative and
-ta pronominal-adverbial suffix ""there."" For examples cf. §93.
    The possessive and the various oblique cases are quite regular. A
list of them with examples is given in §§93, 94. What is possibly a
special development of -ti, with, is found with a few nouns (cf. syntax
§118), where it apparently has the force of a subjective or vocative
case ending.
                        §99. Formation of Plural
    The plural is formed today, with a very few exceptions, by suffixing
-te (rarely -ti). There are however a number of other ""vestigial""
methods, e.g., the suffixation of -i, -u, -s (si), -ya?, -lu, -ma, different
stem, and -tete.
    It is difficult to decide definitely whether -te is to be regarded as a
secondary form of the verbal iterative -te or a survival of a much older
function. Yuki proper does not possess it. It is perhaps best to take
it as a local Wappo development.
    -i, vestigial in Wappo, although clearly fused idiomatically with a
fair number of noun-stems, is normal in Yuki proper (with a variant
in -a) although these are confined to names of animals and plants.4"" The
Yokuts possess the same elements -i, -a, for persons and a few animals
and Pomo has -ya employed only with persons.
    -s, found in only one doubtful noun but the regular plural pronom-
inal suffix and still functional in -si, ""times,"" is still used for a few
personal nouns in Yuki proper.47
    4u, slightly functional in a few cases in Wappo is unknown as a
plural noun suffix in Yuki proper. It is clearly a secondary development
of verbal continuative -, -le.
    -ma, noun-formative, most frequently used with nominalized verbs
(cf. §93), is found in Yuki proper as -am collective.
    Differentiation of stem for singular and plural occurs in one or two
forms and is certainly not without significance. The examples are:
    anu'tse, child, o'kato, children; tu'tca, large (singular), kaVtomela, large
(plural); mai', who (singular), iu'naki, who (plural). The reduplicated plural
-tete is purely local and restricted to relationship terms.

                         §100. Pnrsonal Pronoun
   The personal pronominal series is comparatively simple. With the
exception of te-, him, on-, them, really. demonstrative in origin, they
never fuse with the verb-stem. They appear in two forms, a subjective
and an objective, and in three numbers, singular, plural, and dual,
the last however found only in the third person. The forms follow:
                                Subjective         Objective
              I                   a, ha              i
              thou                mi                 mi
              he                  tse'pi             t-
              we                   'Si               L'sa
              you                 mt'Si              mt'sa
              they (plural)       tse'kati, o'ni     tse'kato, on-
              they (dual)         o'kati             o'koto
    A comparison with Yukian proper, Coast Yuki, and Huchnom
shows some interesting differences. Yuki proper is far more con-
servative. It has preserved an old singular suffix for the first person
subjective, a first person exclusive plural (mi), and an old third plural.
This old third plural has however been preserved in the possessive
series (mesa). For the third singular Wappo has apparently selected
one demonstrative (or more properly two), and the Yukian dialects,
another. In the third plural Wappo has likewise developed two new
forms, one on the basis of third singular tse (tse'koti) and the other
from an old neutral stem oni (living beings, to live) and formed an
irregular objective from it (a'n-). The Wappo dual o'kato is quite
unknown in Yuki proper, Coast Yuki, and Huchnom. The dual ele-
ment, to judge from its possessive form, is *ko so that kati can be
explained as *ko with plural suffix -ti.
    With regard to the peculiar suffixed pronominal(?) series in the
causative conjugation, cf. §75, d.
    The personal pronouns may be followed by any case suffix and then
always appear in the ""objective"" form, e.g., te'ka, with him, ima, for
me, a 'nwe, for them, etc.
    In subordinate sentences the objective forms are inconsistently used
as the pronominal subject, but Wappo has lost the use of the objective
as the subject of certain verbs, a usage still preserved in Yuki proper.
      i nai' tc'awo'ctawen, when I broke his pine-nut.
1929]             Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                     135    However as the objective personal pronominal forms are also used
as the possessive the foregoing usage has become merged in an idiomatic
construction which consists in employing the possessive forms in indirect
discourse and other subordinate sentences. In origin this is simply the
persistence of the use of the objective form as the subject of the verb
in subordinate clauses, mentioned above. The Yuki idiom of putting
the object of certain transitive verbs in the possessive is clearly iden-
tical.48 There, however, the possessive suffix appears with the pronoun,
which is not the case in Wappo.
    The question of the relation of the Yukian pronominal system is
too large to enter upon here. It shows marked affinities with the
Hokan series in spite of considerable divergence of detail.","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"

                               §38. Modal
    37. -asi, hortatory-subjunctive. This is the regular future -si pre-
ceded by the terminal vowel of the stem which regularly changes to
-a- to express this mode.
    tek-uwa'y-a-si, let him run; tepa""-a-si, let him eat; temo'k'-a-si, let him
drink; tehLnto'-a-si, let him sleep; ite owa't-a-si, let me hit him; ipowe'l-a-si,
let me wrap it.
    38. -tesi, -teki, subjunctive, might This is either merely a special-
ized development of the -te- increment future or a falling together of
two vowels originally distinct. I incline to the latter view and assume
that the subjunctive in -tasi (§72) show the original vowel, the regular
increment future having eventually displaced it phonetically although
50         University of Ca4fornia Publcations un Am. Arcl. and Ethn.             [Vol.27not semantically. Occasionally -te- alone seems to carry the subjunctive
force as in -teki. Cf. also §72.
    naka'p-tesi, he might hold in hand; ke""E-tesi, he might break it; ohi'l-tesi,
he might build; pik'oiye'-tesi, he might crush by trampling; ma'a'n-tesi, he might
dig; ocute'-tesi, he might put it out; oko'he-tesi, he might fasten.    .39. -tasi, subjunctive, may, might. Probably increment future
-tesi with mutated vowel. It has frequently acquired the secondary
meaning of ""may"" as opposed to -tesi ""might."" Not to be confused
with causative -tasi.
   tec'te-tasi, he may comb it; kupa'-tasi, it might get rotten; ma'a&n.tasi, he
may dig; ohupi'-tasi, he may dive; hot'a'-tasi, he may divide; howtt'e'-tasi, he
may iron.    40. -leksi, subjunctive. This was always given as subjunctive with
indefinite, or better, plural subject. It is presumably the original
meaning of increment -lek- that has preserved its force in certain verbs
(-le continuative-plural and -k conditional).
     mahe's-leksi, someone might give, howtVle'-leksi, someone might iron, k'oye'-
leksi, someone might knead; mak-eke'-leksi, they might throw; pik'oi'yc-leksi,
they might crush; ke'le-leksi, they might eat: ohupi'-leksi, someone might dive,
mek'o'l-leksi, someone might wash.
   41. -e', -a', imperative singular. Possibly we are dealing here with
the true stem vowel in certain cases. The universality, however, of -e',
opposed as it is by -i and -a for the indefinite, makes it rather certain
that it is felt as a true imperative. In only two cases was -a' found.
     t'u'me', buy!; meti'le', ring!; map'e'l-e', roll!; ha""-e', bark!, he'k'-e', shave!,
cuka'l-e', drag!, la'l-a', die!; mek-a"", touch!
    42. -ti, imperative singular. This is probably merely a secondary
development of an old participial, absolute suffix, still used with that
force. It is today, however, the common singular imperative affix and
seems to be displacing -e'.
     tso""t-ti, pound!; ohi'tst-ti, pound!; mapi'l-ti, fill up!; t'ai'ya-ti, sing!; ya'o-ti,
name!; mawi""i-ti, hang up!: oka'pt-ti, tie!    43. -la, imperative singular. This is the continuative suffix -1- with
-a imperative. Used mainly with neuter and semi-reflexive verbs.32
    male'u-l1., go!; htnt'a'-la, sleep!; hotama'-la, swim!; pe""-Ia, look!; pi'he-la,
wait!; huwe'li-la, go back!; pika'-la, listen!
    32 They are probably all secondarily interpreted indefinites with continua-
tive -1-.
1929]            19adin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                        51    44. -ma, -mO, progressive imperative. Generally used with verbs
of the ""progressive conjugation"" but also sporadically.
    mema'nu-ma, pick it up!; mey'ka-ma, fly up!; hole'u-ma, run!; le'pu-ma,
stand!; meka'lu-ma, pick up!; meka't'u-ma, pick up!; napico'la-ma, whisper!;
tc-awa'lu-ma, dodge!; pu'lu-ma, run away!; mat'u'yo-ma, have in hand!   45. -me, permissive imperative. This is possibly but not very likely
related to -mi of plural imperatives.
    ts'e'ya-me, well stop!; k*u'e-me, well run!; pa""-me, well eat!; uk'k'i-me, well
drink!; hLntco'el-me, well dream!; yo'k't-me, well stay!    46. -kumi, (dual? or) plural imperative. That -mi is plural seems
clear, but the exact force of -ku- is not at all evident. It may be the
dual -ku- or it may be the aspect suffix -kv- found in -kele. The texts
give no definite clue. The first explanation is the more likely. There
is, however, always the possibility open that the -ku- of -kumi is not
identical with -ke- of -kele.
   pa""elak-kumi, don't eat them!; le'ula-kumi, go (dual) and get her!; pe'hela-
kumi, leave them alone!
    47. -lumi, imperative plural. There seems to be no reason for
doubting that -lu- is in origin the continuative-plural. Although -lumi
is now used with many verbs that have no -1- increment in the future
and past, there is little question but that this more general employ-
ment is a secondary development and that originally it was only found
with such increment forms. Some of the examples in the text suggest
that -lumi either implies a plural subject or a plural subject and plural
object. A differentiation of such a nature is a striking feature of
Southwestern Pomo.
    In general it may be said that imperative singulars in -e' take -lumi.
    tewe'la-lumi, come back!; tse-'i-lumi, stop!; tc-amewi""l-lumi, tell me!;
matco'e-lumi, come!; hel tetie'-lumi, bring light!; hawe'-lumi, stay here!; tai'tt-
lumi, sing!; pa""e-lume, eat!; k""ue-lume, run!; u'k't-lume, drink!    48. -tumi, imperative plural. -tumi may be analyzed as being in
origin either increment -te- and imperative -mi or imperative singular
-ti- and -mi. The former is by far the more likely for a number of
reasons and -tumi may thus be considered as a formation analogous to
-lumi. It is far more general than the latter, a development that was
clearly hastened by the influence of the singular -ti. As in the case of
-lumi the texts seem to indicate that -tumi implies singular ubjects
and plural object.
52        University of California Publicatiot& in Am. Arch. and Ethn.       [VoL 27   Practically all imperatives with singulars in -ti and many in -e'
take -tumi.
    tc-ake'kt-tumi, throw it away!; teno'ma-tumi, come and live here! ka'm-tumi,
do!; ye'ka-tumi, get (some more)!; mahe'ta-tumi, go and pack it!; tai'-tumi, sing!;
hotca'-tumi, divide it!
    49. -ttlumi, imperative plural. This is probably the singular im-
perative -ti and -lumi, and is possibly a recent formation. It seems to
have the same significance as -tumi. One example was obtained in
which it is used with the interrogative, thus suggesting that its force
is not always felt as that of an imperative.
     ika'm-ttlumi, what are you going to do?; mai'powe'l-tclumi, wrap yourselves
up!; mai'osa'-ttlumi, cover yourselves!; tai'-tclumi, sing!; paka-tt'lumi, eat!
    50. -kdlumi, imperative plural. Evidently bears the same relation
to -kumi that -ttlumi does to -lumi. It is extremely rare: le'ula-kdumi,
(many) get (many)!
     51. -hi, interrogative, probably for non-past tenses.
    tco-iya'ki-hi, can he go?; kuiya'ki-hi, can he run?; okaliya'ki-hi, can he talk;
mi onaoc-la'ki-hi, didn't you see anyone?; mitse'-hi, is that you?; nao'we'-hi, don't
(you) see it?
     52. -yo, interrogative, probably for past tenses.
    inaota'-yo, what did I see?; ika'mta-yo, what did I do?; itsa""ta-yo, what did
I say?; itsa""c-yo, what is he saying?","[58, 59, 60, 61]"
"
                               §39. Voice
    53. -la, medio-passive, semi-reflexive, idiomatic. Not related to -1,
-le continuative, although some -la may be variants of -4e.
     ca'ku-la, it split; hu'p-la, it jumped out; aonu'ha-la, I've hidden it away;
nasu'tt-la, to hold head in hands; nahu'-la, to lie; mak'o'i-la, to get up alone;
pici""u-la, it is breezy; pet'a'o-la, to hold leg out; panamu's--la, to keep mouth
closed; nahe'tsi-la, to kneel; pamu'tsi-la, to shut eyes; hutsi""u-la, to smile.
     hoka'ta-la, he carries object in hand; ak'u'wa-la, I'm running; a'hotco'ha-la,
I'm walking; howa'la-la, crawling; aopu'lu-la, I'm running away.
    54. -le, passive and medio-passive. Generally found with me-, ce-,
se-, ke-, te-.
    a omali'hc-le, I was hit; a ohe'yc-le, I was rubbed; a op.o'i-le, I was kicked;
ahe'k'e-le, I was shaved; hok-a'l-le, it was stretched.
    55. -vki, -vke, passive. That the passive force is not now inherent
in -kv to any extent and certainly was not there originally but in the
-u- vowel preceding it, is quite evident. -kv- is however beginning to
be regarded as passive in itself as evidenced by the number of verbs
1929]              Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                           53with passive significance that appear without preceding -u-. -kv is
probably identical with -ki past and is becoming identified with nom-
inalizing -k. For the origin of -u- cf. §74.
  teke'k'-uke, he was thrown; oku't-uke, (fire) was made; pite'k-ukc, he was
tripped; onc't-uki, it was caught; matsi'-uke, it was roasted; a mace'c-uki, I was hit.
    opo'i-ke, he was kicked; mali""-ke, he was pushed; howai'-kE, it was forbidden;
umewt'l-ke, he was told; a'tema'n-ke, I was brought home; mapo'n-ke, he was
locked up; a'taTl*-ke, he was killed; a'matso'tal-ke, I was stuck.
    56. -u-, passive and semi-passive base vowel. Cf. §74.
    57. -mcle, passive of known agent and idiomatic. In ordinary con-
versational Wappo -mcle was consistently rendered as a passive of
known agent, but in the texts its meaning proved to be far more gen-
eralized and vague. The parallel suffixes -cele, -scle, -kelc, and -telc
suggest that -me- is merely a variant of indefinite -mi. But if this is
so we must imagine its fusion with -4e to have taken place before -mi
had developed into a specific tense suffix. -4e is a variant of medio-
passive -la and is identical with medio-passive 4e. The passive base
in -u- so extensively found with passive -kv and medio-passive -4a,
rarely occurs with -mele.
    a' ota'tsL-mele, I'm going to be slapped by him; a' owa'ti-mele, I'm going to
be hit by him; a' op-oi'-mcle, I'm going to be kicked by him; oka't--mcle, it's
being twisted by him; ots-u'-melc, it's being burned by him; mapa""-o-mclc, it's
being eaten by him; oka'p-u-mclc, it's being tied by him; hali'-melc, they drove
them around; ye""-mele, they're setting the trap; tcani'-mele, they're taking them
out; ot'ai'-mele, they divided it; ot'ai'mele, they're singing; tc-o'c-mele, (they)
put it in.
   58. -sele, passive and medio-passive. The nature of the agent is
not definitely indicated and a discrepancy between conversational and
textual usage, such as held in the case of -mc-I, is not known. -cc- is
to be taken as the durative-usitative and not as its specialized variant
employed in the indefinite. The passive base vowel -u- frequently pre-
cedes it.
    a' cuka'l-sele, I am being dragged; mehi'u-selc, he's being shaken; tu'c-usclc,
it was taken away; maka'l-usele, he was pulled in; ma'otcu'l-usele, turned over
from side to side; t'a'pi-scle, (where) they were yelling; meko'tti-scle, tickling
him; namo'i-scle, it itches.
   59. -cele, passive, -medio-passive, and idiomatic. The nature of the
agent is not definitely indicated, and the medio-passive, semi-reflexive
aspect is more prominently developed than the passive. -cv- is the
durative-inchoative, not the indefinite tense, suffix.
   mcla""-cele, they're catching; t'aVlecele, they're catching; tcma'n--ccle, bring
clover for him; piwa'l-ccle (they) were called; le'u-ccle, they came after; mama'n-
cele, they took it home; a' oke'tc-cele, I was cut; tco'tc-cele, making baskets;
tc'tc'-Ele (tc'tc'-ccle) open!; te V'Vl-cel&nami, something to kill him with.
54         University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.      [VoL 27   60. -tele, medio-passive, rarely passive. This is the increment -te-
and the medio-passive -le. It does not occur frequently.
     pine'a-tel-ela""ki, he doesn't catch; teheya'-tele, bring.
    61. -kele, medio-passive, passive, and idiomatic. This -ke is one of
the most puzzling elements in the language. It is not the inferential.
It is most likely identical with the -kv- of unknown significance found
in the texts and in some verbs before the increment -te- (hoku'i-k-
teki, he bumped head).
    tepica'is-kele, to embrace; hate'l-kele, it was known; tele'ula-kele, they came
after them; memewi'ma-kele-tsel, then he took it; hok'a'l-kele, to stretch already;
k'u'we-kele, to run already; hotco'hel-kele, to run already.
    62. -uk&si, inferential passive. This suffix consists of passive base
vowel -u-, -kt- inferential, and -si future. It is quite frequent in con-
versational Wappo but apparently rare in the texts. In intransitive
verbs it also has a passive-inferential force.
    hek'-u'ktsi, he might be shaved: okap-u'ktsi, it might be tied; a'oketc-u'ktsi,
I might be cut; mapo'n-oktsi, he might be locked up; otap-u'ktsi, he might be
stabbed; meheh-u'ktsi, he might be rubbed; mep oi-o'ktsi, he might be kicked;
ok-u'y-uktsi, they might run after him (i.e., he might be run after); hole'w-ukLsi,
they might go hunting.
                                  §40. Aspect
    63. -si, general causative-indefinite tense. Probably to be analyzed
as -s- causative and -i tense-aspect. It is an extremely puzzling suffix
because it seems to appear only in the first person and to be used
almost exclusively in the conjugation of adjectives in the positive and
comparative degree and some verbs used reflexively. In the past it is
employed quite regularly with all verbs (-sta). It is also clearly felt
in the -s- of -sa causatives which are, like -sta, not restricted to any
persons or verbs. All indications appear consequently to point to -si
as the first person singular of a causative conjugation, used with
adjectives and intransitive verbs. Cf. §75, ld.
    aotsa'tst-si, I make it cold (mi otsa'tst-ti, you make it cold); aco'iya'si, I
make it hot; atu'tce-si, I enlarge it; aku'tLyC-si, I make it smaller; aok'e'nt-si, I
make it long; a-omi't-c-si, I make it shorter.
    The past and future tenses of this causative are -mes-ta and -mes&si,
although -sta is also found occasionally for the past.
    64. -sta, -tsta, general causative, past tense. It consists of -s- causa-
tive and -ta past tense generally used with transitive verbs. As causative
past, however, it appears only with intransitives.
     ateht'nto-tsta, I made him sleep; atemeyo'kel-Lsta, I made him get up; atets'-
u'tst-sta, I made him sneeze; ateka'pLk-tsta, I made him cough; atek a'ma-yLsta,
I made him cry; ahLntco'-&sta, I made him dream.

person singular, and all persons in the plural. Cf. causative conjuga-
tion §75d.
    66. -sa, causative-indefinite tense. It is used for all persons and
is identical with the -sa of -tasa. Rarely found alone. -sa indefinite
is probably the same element. Cf. discussion §75, 1.
    atetco'pala-sa, I'm making him warm; atetco'ala-sa, I'm making him sick;
at'ata-sa, he is leaching acorns (at'ata-si, at'ata-ttsta, future, past); 'tta-sa, he
sucks breast (AVta-si, ot*-tsta, future, past).
    67. -tasa, -tasi, -t&sta, general causative-indefinite, future and past.
The causative element is -s-. The explanation of -ta- entails great
difficulties. It is possibly an old transitive suffix or merely -t- iterative-
plural. Cf. discussion §84.
    Verbs in -1 and some others never take this causative.
    In a number of verbs these causative suffixes have become idioma-
tically fused with the stem.
     atehutsa'ta-tasa, I'm making him well; mapula'-tasa, he blows; t'o'l-tasa, he
catches in net: co'i-tasa, he scorches; hott'k-tasa, he splashed in water; ateomv'ko-
ttsta, I put him to bed; atekat-a'-ttsta, I made him laugh; te'tseu-ttsta, he made
it drop off; a'tehutsatE-t'sta, I made him well; atehuk-t'ta-ttsta, I made him
drunk; a't'ata-tt'sta, he leached acorns; co'i-ttsta, he scorched; hots-a'pi-ttsta,
he broke round object.
     atehuk*t'ta-tasi, I'll make him drunk; o't-asi (a't-tasi), he will suck breast;
oli'tsa-tasi, he will fill up; co'i-tasi, he will scorch; ku'pa-tasi, it will be decayed:
mahe'ti-tasi, he will carry; mapa'k-tasi, he will shoot through.
    68. -tasa, in the act of, about to. This is possibly identical with
causative -tasa, and subjunctive -tasa. However they may all be
unrelated. Cf. discussion §75, lb.
    tcale'i-tasa, I'm about cutting it off; tcali""i-tasa, I'm about pushing it off;
p'o'i-tasa, I'm about kicking it; mewi'-tasa, I'm about catching it; makE'ki-tasa,
I'm about throwing it; hosi'wela-tasa, they're about getting away.
    69. -ca, inchoative indefinite. Most of the forms in -ca have -c-
in the other tenses.
    okelu'wa-ca, he gets lonesome; he""le-ca, it steams; hu'ti-ca, he becomes
crazy; hutsila""-ca, he becomes blind; ko'ho-ca, he becomes lame; nepu'ts-a-ca, it
becomes full of blood.
     70. -i, inchoative imperative.
     le'l-ci', turn into stone!; me*'i-ci, turn into water!; ma'ta-ci, turn into a mountain!
     71. -1, continuative. The rather complicated history of the con-
tinuatives is discussed in §78.
     po'te-l, falling to pieces; mele'k'c-l, to peep out; tsana'k-ae-l, to eat; tsanawi'-
kE-l, to eat; tsanapa""E-I, to eat; huya'ko-l, to fly around; howa'le-l, to crawl;
yiwv'-l, to race.
56,        Univer8ity of Caoifornia Pubiations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.              [Vol. 27    72. -1e, continuative-plural. Identical with -4 but probably belonging
to a different period of the language.
     nats'e'ye-le, they eat it up; nats'a'-le, to chew; ts'u'te-le, they skinned; ma'-
tcule'le, turning over; k'a'ne-le, packing; ts'u'pc-le, to take in snare; tucu'yo-le,
throwing it; tca'se-le, loving.
    73. -s-, usitative-durative. One of the most frequent suffixes in
the language and one that appears idiomatically fused to the verb-stem
in numerous instances. The indefinites in -sv are special developments
of it. It is rarely used, or perhaps better, rarely recognized in the
indefinite and future. In the latter tense it would, of course, become
assimilated with the -si of the future.
    mana'o-s-ta, he showed him (na'o, to see); hatt'-s-ki, she knows (ha'ta, to
know); oma'nt-s-ki, he held (ma'ni, to hold); la'm-s-ki, he carried flat object
(lom, to carry); kate'-s-ki, he carried long object (ka'tt, to carry); na'mt-s-ki,
they lived (no'mi, to live); ots&'tst-s-ta, he boiled it (tsi'tsi, to boil); tema'u'kt-s-ta,
he gave her to drink; no'kt-s-ta, they made friends (nak, friend).
    74. -c-, durative-inchoative. Whether this is a variant of -s- or
vice versa is an open question. That it is identical with indefinites
and inchoatives in -cv is manifest. Like -s- it is found idiomatically
fused to verb-stems, although not so frequently.
   na'm&-c-ki, they made a home (cf. no'mt-s-ki, they lived); tsutsu'-tc-ki, he
became a dog, mett'c-tc-ki, he held on tight, co't-c-ki, it got hot.
   e'la-cv, to get deep; ant'-cv, to be human; owI'-c, to put acorns in receptacle.
   75. -ke, -k-, meaning unknown. This suffix is found only in texts
and not only was its meaning quite unknown to my main informant,
but he often regarded such forms as incorrect. It is possibly identical
with petrified -k and with Yuki -ak which means a single activity.
Occasionally it is found idiomatically fused with certain verb-stems.
      tc-aka'luma-ke'-ke, they took her out; ma'uku'yv-k-ti, they ran after him;
hrntco""a-k-ta, he dreamt; lal-k-me, to die; hopatc*a'kekL-si, will leave one an-
other; ko'totu' oka'l-ke-te, they told one another (dual); weta'le-k-ti, they dropped;
tsele'-k-teki, he stayed behind; mesa tenat'a'a-ku-kwen, when they got there;
kuku'i-k-tesi, he will burap head; mata'mo-k-me, to fall on stomach; wi'-k-teki,
to grab a person, they hung on; hona'nv-k-tesi, he will open (crack open); nuke'u-
k-ti, they all fell in.
    76. -kv-, inferential. This is apparently never found alone but
always in composition with other elements. Cf. -uktsi, -l-k, -ma-k.
    77. -we, meaning unknown. It is possibly a variant of -e-, -e- found
as sign of plurality of some verbs. Only a few instances were obtained,
one of which however occurs frequently.
      husi'-we, they speak; pela'-we, look!; ika'mti-we, do something.

for run, crawl, go, as some of the examples definitely indicate. It is
very extensively used.
    mawat-ka'-si, he hits intermittently; a'mapoi'-ka-ta, I kicked one after
another; a'mahe'-ka-si, I will give it to one after another; hotse's--ka-ta, he swam
from one place to another; nahe'wi-ka-ta, he jumped around.

                              §37. Tense-Aspect
    19. -i, -a, -e, indefinite tense. Strictly speaking it is incorrect to
consider these vowels suffixes or inherently connected with the ex-
pression of tense alone, for an older classification of verbs into active
and inactive may also be involved. Be this as it may, however, today
they are felt as tense endings and we shall treat them as such.
    i'l-i, he binds (i'lta, past); o-e'l-i, he digs (o-e'le', imperative); oci'p-i, he
sews (oci'pe', imperative); a's.-a, he gives (a's.i, imperative); ha't-a, he knows
(hatel, imperative); hoka'lel-a, he keeps (hoka'lel, imperative); ha'-e, he says
(haiyi', imperative); ha""-e, he barks (ho""ti, imperative).    20. -mi, indefinite tense. This suffix is rather puzzling. It is by
far the most frequent of the rather numerous elements indicating indefi-
nite time and activity. Although there are a number of tense and
aspect suffixes beginning with -m- in Wappo (-ma, -ma, -mak), I do not
feel it is related to any of them. Originally it was possibly associated
with the idea of collectivity and habitual action but it possesses no
such idea now. Today it has become merely the most common suffix
of the indefinite.
     i'u-mi, he moves; oha""-mi, he fans; oka'le-mi, he hangs; ola'to-mi, he hits;
olo'l-mi, he dances.    21. -se, -sa, -si, indefinite tense. Although used today simply to
indicate the indefinite, the origin of this suffix is quite clear. It con-
sists of -s- durative, iterative with variable terminal vowel. It is because
of its original force, only weakly, if at all felt now, that the majority
of verbs with plural increments -te- and -el- have sv in the indefinite.
    D'i-se, he moves gently (a'iy-el-si, future); oha'we-se, he bets (oha'wa-si,
future); omv'ki-se, he lies (omv'ka-si, future); omo'ti-se, it overflows (omoti'a-si,
future); e'lu-sa, he keeps hold of (e'lu-si, future); o't-a-sa (a't-as-sa) he sucks breast
(Atts-ta, past); oce'ha-sa, he guesses (oce""-ta, past); owo'e-si, he rubs (owo'ye,
imperative); u'kL'tL-si, he is drunk (u'kt'ta-si, future); cuka'li-si, he drags (cukale'-
si, future).

tive-durative is clearly related to -sv (-s) and what exactly constitutes
the difference it is extremely difficult to say. The examples seem to
indicate that -cv implies continuous durative activity whereas -sv
implies iteration more than duration.
     e'li-ce, he digs a hole (e'l-te-si, future); i'wu-ce, he moves (i'u-te-si, future);
Ate'wL-Ci, he is dead (ate'wtki, past); o'tt-ci, he sucks (o'tt-si, future); oka'-ce, he
answers (oka'-si, future); otsai'-ce, it tips over (otsai'tsi, future); ku""-ca, it
stinks (ku""ki, past); ku'la-ca, it smells; (ku'laki, past); ka'li-ca, it aches (ka'lLc-ki,
past).
   24. -Isi, -tes8i3, future. These forms are the regular future preceded
by the plural-continuative and plural-iterative infixes. See section on
conjugations (§§54-64).
    ikapo'te-lsi, he will bother; htntc-o'hE-lsi, he will dream; O'iye-lsi, it moves
gently; ha'ts-lsi, he will know; oka'l-tesi, he will talk; owai""-teso, he will quarrel;
ko""-tesi, he will get hurt.
    25. -stesi, future. Plural-iterative infix preceded by usitative -s-.
    ene'-stesi, he will be afraid; ht'npikal-e'stesi, he will be sleepy; ho-e'wt-stesi,
he will be ignorant of.
    26. -leksi, future, future-conditional.31 Idiomatically this suffix is
used as the regular future of certain verbs. Its original force of a future
conditional is, however, frequently felt, especially with verbs that form
their futures regularly in -si. In origin -lEksi is simply -e- continuative-
plural, -k- conditional, and -si future.
    cu'tu-leksi, he will hang on; oka'he-leksi, he will be constipated; ha'ku-leksi,
he will be hungry; cutLne'-leksi, he will stoop.
    27. -ksi, -ktesi, futures, conditional futures. These are really con-
ditional futures used idiomatically, at times, as the regular futures of
certain verbs.
    tc-api'ko-ksi, he will pull out; hona'nv-ktesi, he will open; huku'i-ktesi, he will
bump head.
   28. -si, -SE- -CE, future. This is the regular suffix for the future
used with the overwhelming majority of verbs. -cv is either -c+si or
a confusion of s with c.
     a's-i-si, he will give; -'ltt-si, he will dig a hole; ene'ste-si, he will be afraid;
i'le-si, he will bind; e'laci (for e'lac-si), it will get deep; a'ttas-i (for o't-as-si), he
will suck; oc&ka'li-ce, he will be stingy.
    30 Apparently this same future also has a conditional-subjunctive force.
    31 For its conditional and subjunctive force cf. §72-76.
48        University of Califormia Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.       [Vol. 27    29. -vya, -iya, indefinite tense. In origin both these suffixes are
certainly variants of an old verb ya, to go, rarely used now but pre-
served in suffix -ya- and yael, to climb. Both -vya and -iya have become
especially associated with the periphrastic futures and pasts in -maksi
and -makta, although found with the simple conjugation likewise.
    O'manots'e'wi-ya, he is afraid (omanots' e'wasi, future); ho-e'wi-ya, he is ig-
norant of (ho-e'wu-si, future); hoka'ka-iya, he crawls (hoka'kesi, future); hole'-iya,
he runs (hole'omoksi, future); mahe'ti-ya, he picks up, etc. (mahe'tita-si, future);
male'pi-ya, he gets up (male'pumaksi, future); mema'ni-ya, he picks up (mema'-
n-makta, past).
    In its old sense of movement as such without reference to tense it
is extensively used in the texts.
     'si metco'hi-ya, we'll go away; o'ntu teyo'keya, he flew to them; ts-atc.-
a'waliya, he dodges down; maha'wa-y-asi, let us get started.
    30. -maksi, progressive future. This is really the verb mak, to move,
now only sparingly used. The future form -maksi, as well as the past
-makta, are found idiomatically with certain verbs and generally have
an indefinite in -iya and an imperative in -ma or -ma. Although clearly
related to -mv, denoting general motion, this latter -mv is not a variant
of -mok and has had an entirely independent history, best shown by
the fact that -mv is rarely found as the indefinite of the ""progressive""
conjugation.
    hole'o-maksi, he will run (hole'iya, present); mele'pu-maksi, he will get up
(mEle'p-iya, present); mema'nu-moksi, he will pick up (mema'n-iya, present);
pi'ti-moksi, he will take out of water (pi'ti-yo, present); pitsa'pt-maksi, he will
mash (pitsa'pi-se, present); ttti'u-maksi, he will shake (ttti'tt-si, present).
    31. -yao, -yaomi, periphrastic future. Just as one variant of the
old verb -ya has become associated with the indefinite, so another
variant -yao, -yaomi has become secondarily connected with the
future, generally however preserving something of its old force of
expressing movement. The first form -yao, fairly extensively used in
the texts, has the force of a conditional or an uncertain future, whereas
the fuller form -yaomi (-yao plus -mi indefinite) expresses a definite
futurity. The meaning of the -o- is unknown. In a limited number of
*verbs -yaomi has completely displaced -si and in other instances it has
been added to -si (-siyaomi).
    tc.aput'i'-yao-u ts-apik-ase, it feels as if coming off (the presence of the past
tense enclitic u shows how little -yao is really felt as a future); mamuyE'-yao-tsel,
the sun was just going down; htntale'k-yao-tsel, when (I) was going to sleep;
temenat'a'a-yao-tsel, when he was going to get there; kuwe'-yao-wen, when I was
going to run; muka'-yao-tsel, when I was going to lie down; tcw'l-yaomi, he's going
to be sick; huci'-i-yaomi, good; k*a'ma-yaomi, to cry; tet'o'-yaomi, to kill him.
1929]              Bad-in: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                             49    In the following instances it is the regular future:
     ota'tsilek-ya'omi, he will slap; otst'p-yaomi, he will paint red; ca'tt-yaomi,
it will be bitter; he'lLc-yaomi, it will steam; ko""-yaomi, it will boil.
   32. -kyaomi, -lyaomi, mokyaomi, -lekyaomi, periphrastic futures.
They are used exactly as the corresponding forms in -si.
   33. -ta, indefinite past tense. It is used with all transitive verbs.
    a's--ta, he gave; e'l-ta, he kept hold of; i'l-ta, he bound; o'ti-ta, he sucked.
    34. -sta, -kta, -lekta, -Ita, -makta, indefinite past time. They are
used exactly as the corresponding forms for the future.
    35. -ki, probably indefinite past time. -ki probably refers to a
single past action. It is regularly used with certain verbs instead of -ta.
Whether it is identical with -kv passive it is difficult to say. In all
probability it was originally used without any specific temporal force
and became specifically associated with intransitive, neuter, and passive
verbs (cf. §§74-80). Also used to form verbs from adjectives.
    i'u-ki, he moved; amiho'kewt-ki, it becomes daylight (indefinite and past);
3'tewL-ki, he was dead; o'ka-ki, he answered; oli'tca-ki, he was full; ome*'i-ki, it
was wet; omoti'-a-ke, it overflowed; omv'ka-ki, he lay (down); opi'tct-ki, it broke.
    36. -cki, -ski, -teki, -steki, -Iki, past tense. These are used like the
corresponding future forms except that the increment -te- always takes
-ki and never -ta so that some transitive verbs are found with -teki.
In all likelihood -teta contracted into -t*a and then gave way to -teki
since -te- increment verbs would have a future in -tesi.
    e'lte-ki, he dug a hole; otia'te-ki, he drowned (transitive), hilute-ki, he rocked.","[55, 56, 57, 58]"

                            §118. Subordination
    Practically all subordination is expressed by postpositions, by
appending nominal case suffixes, employing the absolute form of the
verb, using those with no grammatical suffixes at all or suffixes of
purely aspect signification, and finally by eliding the vowel of the tense
suffix.
    The important subordinating postpositions are tsel (rarely tse) used
mainly with the indefinite and future tenses, wen or -kwen used mainly
with the past, and tseta and tu' used with any tense.
    How fundamental is the position of these conjunctions is proved
by the fact that when tsel, tu', tseta precede the verb they never have
a subordinating meaning.
    1. tsel, when, if.
    The verb preceding tsel is either not affected at all, i.e., it appears
with its regular tense suffixes or this tense suffix loses its terminal
vowel, or finally, the verb appears in its absolute form either with or
without terminal vowel. Under what conditions these three distinct
influences of tsel upon the verb take place is not clear.
    The indefinites in -i and the futures never lose their full endings.
    a. With no change.

    5. Nominalization (instrumentalized verbs).
   As we have seen, the absolute stem or the absolute stem with one
of the participial-absolute suffixes (-k, -c, -s, -1) is always subordinate
to the verb that follows. In all these cases its use is strictly analogous
to that of the English participle. In addition to this spurious type of
nominalization a true form also exists consisting of the appending of
the nominal suffix -noma and the case suffixes -ma, for, -i, with (only
as -nomi) and (rarely) -ka, with. These forms are very extensively
used as the following examples will show.
    a. -noma, where, the place of, where with.
    pa't*a memet'u'pulu tema'numekta me'mai'atsila'sanama, then he took down
his beads wherewith he decorated himself.
    a' maku'yelki ho'ts-a o'nknama, I went out to the place where they dig.
    tse'u tcaecki ala'lekta na'ma, he went to where the dead people live.
    pa'tta na'ota k-a teku'isenama, and he saw where the person had come in.
    ""mapT'shela, he tetc'o'lcelenama?"", ""Look, is that with which they kill them?""
15G         Univer8ity of CaUifornia Publications in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27    ""he'ku mai'hotco'halanuma?"", ""Is this where one walks along?"".
    ""tu'pulu e'yEma tet'u'tvknoma, tse i'si mul tc*aki'lta"", then her beaded belt
that she had wrapped around herself, that.we took off.
    tse'te an t'o'enama, by means of that he kills people.
    pa't*a tse k'e'tci te-ole'oknoma tc'ak'e'tcittsta, and he cut them where they
were tied.
      b. -no'mi, with, by means of, wherewith.
    ""i'i' yo""oki teto'l-celena'mi,"" ""Yes there is something with which to kill
him.""
   i mai""a hosa'hano'mi ma""a tseka'lica, what I cover myself, is just the same.
      c. -ma, in order to, infinitive.
    pa'tta te'o'ci te'tumahe'sta te'oke'tcima, then his grandfather gave him
something for cutting.
     ""mapits-ai'ya o'nvkma ts-a mihu'uci'iyaki,"" ""you ugly one, you're only good
for stealing.""
    o'ni tepiwa'lci opa""ema, they don't want to wake him up to eat.

    le'lehol tek'e'tc-ema ami'sa to-okai'wsta, sweat-house poles you are to cut,
I'm to let you know.
    pa't-a memt'si tcake'kita ts e'u memt'si mak'e'yime, where he had left his
wife there he went to look for her.
     ""a mi tele'ulekta mai""ka ys'ke mak-c'lma,"" ""I've come after you in order
to have you eat mush with me.""
    an tc'o'l-ema tse'pi tse'upi anwa'lci, he calls them in order to kill them.
     ""a hint'o'ota la""ki o'le'a mak'e'leme,"" ""I can't sleep because I want to eat

    pa""ema pa't-a mewi'l.ci, he told (them) to eat.
    o'nka tco""me hat'a'ema k'e'cu, he went with them to divide the deer.
    d. -ka, with, by (rather rare).
    me'tayi pai' ho'cupepi'se met'api's.eka, the woman (standing) alone turned
her head from side to side in order to yell.
    6. Nominalization (relative clauses). Cf. also §93.
    All relative clauses are expressed by ""nominalizing"" the verb sub-.
ordinated. The suffixes used (-k, -1, -c, -s), having both a verbal-aspect
signification and being noun formatives, it must remain an open ques-
tion whether we are to regard them as the one or the other. They are
probably verbal with the possible exception of -k.
      a'hol mu'kvk na'oci, I see the stick that is lying.
      k-e'o yo'ok' (yo'ak-k) na'oci, I see the man who is sitting.
      tse'pi mek-u'wek ha'ta, he said that he had run.
      a k-e'u le'pvk na'oci, I see the man who was standing.
      a k-e'u u'k'tc na'oci, I see the man who was drinking.

(without vowel) but exceptions occur.
     20. me-, he, suus, because subject of both subordinate and principal clause
are the same; tutca, large; -c-, durative; -u-, inorganic vowel; -k for -ki, adjective-

suffix -yo (t'o'yo).
     36. -ka, comitative.
     37. Stem kam'. -i is the indefinite tense suffix also generalized as present
participle.

"                            §46. Verb Ba8es
    The vast majority of verb bases, and all tense-aspect and modal
suffixes (the imperative occasionally excepted), end in vowels. This is
not true of Yuki proper where we find at least half the verbs terminating
in consonants. That Wappo represents the primary condition we have
given evidence to show in another connection. However, the compara-
tive ease with which so many terminal vowels disappeared in Yuki
and the frequency with which they disappear in certain tense-aspects
in Wappo, suggests that in addition to phonetic causes these vowels
had, in the minds of the speakers, acquired a specific force permitting
such loss. What this force was is not always clear, but in the main it
seems to have been connected with the expression of mode, voice, and
aspect. We may, I think, without running any great danger of being
wrong, definitely claim that whatever the phonetic causes were that
resulted in the development of the present terminal ablaut series,
today we have in Wappo a definite vowel -i associated with intransitive,
62         Univer8ity of Caifornia Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27impersonal, and inactive verbs; -a connected with transitive and active;
-u with the passive; -i with the durative-usitative, and -a with the
subjunctive.
     So far, however, we have only considered the terminal vowels.
But in Wappo we find, not infrequently, that changes in the vowel of
the stem itself are correlated with changes in the meaning of certain
verbs; that, for instance, durative, intensive, diminutive, and other
activities are expressed by mutations in the initial consonant or the
basic vowel of the stem. That these are not accidental is indicated
by the fact that the consonantal change is from glottalized to unglottal-
ized, from affricative to corresponding sibilant, from affricative to
corresponding stop, etc., and that the vocalic shifts are consistently
vowel to diphthong for intensive and vowel to -i for durative, etc.
     It is certainly a significant fact that the terminal vowel ablaut is
almost exclusively connected with voice and mode,- and the conso-
nantal and basic stem-vowel ablaut with the expression of aspect.
There is some reason for believing the first type of ablaut (terminal
vowel of disyllabic stems), to be a secondary Wappo trait not shared
by Yukian in general,33, but there seems no justification for so inter-
preting the second type. There are numerous indications in Yuki
proper, for example the meaning of vowel-doubling, etc., suggesting
that it is an old and fundamental Yukian trait.
     In short, we may postulate at least eight bases: stem without a
formative; active-transitive -a-; intransitive-impersonal -i; passive -u;
durative -i; intensive diphthong; diminutive consonantal ablaut and
subjunctive-hortatory -a. To these must then be added the so-called
expanded, i.e., the increment, bases.
     1. Active-transitive, -a.-Active and transitive does not perhaps com-
pletely define the force of this formative, for verbs in -a occur that
cannot be brought under this rubric. Some of these are undoubtedly
simply stems in -a, since not all verbs ending in -a have necessarily
had their final vowel interpreted as active-transitive. Certain forms
like hopi'la, it is full, as contrasted with opi'l-mi, to fill (transitive),
present difficulties. Either -a has in addition to its active-transitive
significance some other meaning not quite clear, or the -a of hopila is
the petrified causative -a, the verb consequently meaning, to make it
filled. The second is, I feel, the correct interpretation. In this case
we are fortunate enough to know that pil is the stem. In such examples,
however, as e'laca, to dig deep, as contrasted with its related o-e'li, to
dig out, we are in no such advantageous position. o-e'li is intransitive
     33 I personally believe that it is a fairly old trait of Yukian.
1929]             1Radin: A Grammaor of the Wappo Language                          63in form and meaning but e'laca is transitive in form and not in meaning.
Our difficulty is possibly more apparent than real for the translation
may be at fault. The suffix -c- suggests that ""to deepen"" is perhaps a
more correct translation. Similarly e'name, be .jfraid, can perhaps better
be rendered by ""to fear someone."" It seems consequently quite likely
that -a has fairly universally become associated with a definite transi-
tive-active connotation, the only exceptions being a few forms with
petrified causative -a. We need not point out that this causative -a is
itself of course in the nature of a transitive suffix. Indeed historically
it is more than likely that it was just this causative -a that led to the
interpretation of terminal -a as a transitive-active formation and to
its subsequent extension.
     One difficulty-inherent in many stems-is to determine what the
terminal vowel really is. Here we shall be guided by the phonetic
rules treated in §25-32 relating to the influence of the various tense-
aspect suffixes and of the increments upon this vowel.
    Let us first select a few examples that illustrate the force of -a
beyond the slightest doubt.
    ot a-sa, suck breast, o'tt-ci, suck (intransitive); oya'-la-ca (*oya) move up
and down (transitive), *oye (intrans.); ha'ta, know (trans.), ha'tu-ke, be discovered
(passive); opv'ta-ki, drink water (*ta), tt'pce, jump in water (*ti); mata'li, sprinkle
(*ta), hotL'kmi, splash in water (*ti); (me)wa'ya, muss up (trans.); owa'ye, rub
(intrans.); mo'na-, hide (trans.), mo'ni, hide (intrans.); mahe'ta-se, carry (trans.),
mahe'te-ske, carry (intrans.).
    -a with the same force also appears in the following:
    E'la-ca, get deep (deepen); e'na-me, be afraid (fear); oli'tsa, fill up; ca'ita-sa,
scorch; cu'lta-sa, drop (trans.); hoka'ta-la, carry round objects; homa'na-Ja,
possess; homa'sa-sa, miss; huci'a, like; hune'na, carry on head; huna'ha, carry on
shoulders.
    Unquestionably a large number of transitives with indefinites in -i
and -mi belong here. In all these cases, as the other tenses and the
imperative likewise show, original -a has been reduced to -e or -C.
    That quite a number of transitives either have no vowel ending
or other vowels than -a the dictionary clearly shows.
    2. Intransitive-impersonal -i.-Clear-cut examples will be found
under -a transitive. -i intransitive is often difficult to keep apart from
-i durative and like -a is changed to other vowels particularly to -e
and -C. All indefinites that change -a- to -i- are duratives although it
does not follow that all stems that have -i- in all the forms are in-
transitives.
    ik'e, pewk; ho'e, bark; ate'wt, be dead; hoka'ni, run on four legs; honats'a'e,
yawn; a'tstti, give birth; o'micoi, be hot; oka'tt-mi, hitch up; hote'ht, melt; huci""i,
be alive.
64         Univer8ity of California Publications in Mn. Arch. and Ethn.           [VoL 27    In many cases where the verb seems fairly definitely to have an
intransitive connotation or to imply impersonal agency we find the
passive-semi-reflexive -u. This need not at all surprise us because first,
the meaning is not very different and secondly, -u is one of the most
active formatives in the language.
   S. Passive-semi-reflexive -u.-All final vowels are fairly regularly
changed to -u or -o for the passive when followed by passive -ki (with
some exceptions), and frequently when followed by medio-passive
and reflexive -la, and passive -melc, -selc, -cele.
     teke'k'u-ke, he was thrown; oku'tu-ke, (fire) was made; one'tu-ki, it was
caught; hek'u'-ktsi, he might be shaved; oka'pu-ktsi, it might be tied; mapo'no-ktsi,
he might be locked up; mepo'i-o-ktsi, he might be kicked; ca'ku-la, it split; pet'a'o-
la, hold leg out; hutsi""u-la, he smiled; aopu'lu-la, I'm running away (pu'lala, he is
running); mapa""o-mele, it is being eaten; oka'pu-mele, it is being tied; mehi'u-sele,
it is being shaken; maka'lu-sele, he was pulled in.
     Changes in the stem vowel itself are also found although rare.
     te-pa'o-mi, drop from hand, tepe'nce, fall off; ta'lke, be killed, ot'a'e, kill.
    4. Durative -i.-This suffix and the intransitive and impersonal have
probably often been confused but they are not identical. In the main
it is the stem vowel itself that is changed to -i to express the durative.
Such a mutation is rare for the intransitive. It is unquestionably the
durative force of -ce (at times of -se), that has caused the change to -i
in the indefinite. Examples follow:
     (a) Change of stem vowel to -i:
     pi'-, peck; pa"", eat.
     wi-, grab; we'c-l, pull off.
     alpi-, carry a person; hu-pe'-n, carry round object.
     wi, carry dangling object; we', carry long object.
     stl, peel off; cal, cut off.
     wihi'-se, discuss; -wai-, deliver a speech.
     t'i'-i, hold in hand; ma-t'u'i, have in hand.
     li'pi, pile up; le'pi, place.
     wi, fight; o-wa'i, quarrel.
    There are probably more. However suggestive and important this
mutation of stem vowel may be historically it is not the usual method
for expressing the durative today. That is done exclusively by the
suffix -ce (occasionally -se), with frequent, but by no means universal,
change of preceding vowel to -i.
    (b) Change of terminal vowel to -i:
    All the indefinites in -se and -cc with ablauted vowel belong here:
     Oti'-se, drown (*ata); t'api'-se, shout (*t'apa); mvki'-se, lie (*mvka), utsitsi'-ce,
get dark (*utsitsa), hutsati'-se, get well (*hutsata); huye'kc-sc, be glad (*huyeka);
kat'i'-se, twist (*kat'a); k-upi'-se, be rotten (*k-upa).

that at an older period of the language the stem vowel was lengthened
to a diphthong to indicate intensity of action. The meaning of quick
repetition also seems to enter into it.
     ma-t'o'u, knock (touch repeatedly?), to, to touch; k'a'i, crushes, k-a, touch;
hu-tce'u, be happy, glad, hu-ci'-se, like; op'e'i-, break (bone), opl'-tci, break;
p'ai-, crack acorns, pa""e, burst of itself; ome-wai'-i-te, deliver a speech, wi'hi-,
discuss; ot'a'i-, go around, tcot (tco), go; po'i, kick, pe-k, track.
    6. Diminutive (consonantal ablaut).-Here, as in the case of diph-
thongization, the dictionary shows a fair number of what are essentially
diminutives, formed by change of consonant either from unglottalized
to glottalized or from one sound to a related one (c>s, c>tc, /'>tc,
etc.). Like diphthongization it has long ceased to be functional.
     tsi, sparks fly, tcu, burn; ts'o'pi, bursts into small pieces, tca'pi, burst; mepi'-
tc-ski, fold arms (hold arms together), pi'-caya, carry stick (hold-close); pi-k'o'-
iye, crush, ka, touch; tc'o'pe, cut off hair, to'pe, cut off; stl, peel off, cal, cut; tco',
fall down, tse'u, drop; t'u'l-i, fondle, to, touch; ca""e, go in quickly, tco, go; me-
ca't'i, hold fingers entwined, na-su'ti, hold head in hand; tca'te, scrape with
fingers, ts'u'te, scrape pan, co'te, scrape with knife; k'a'tse (*k'a) mash, ke""e,
break; ma-tst'k--u, squirt water, o-ct'k-te, sprinkle water.
     7. Miscellaneous activities (vocalic and consonantal ablaut).-In many
cases stems are differentiated to indicate specialized meanings by means
of vocalic and consonantal ablaut. As it was not possible to bring most
of them under a single category, they have been grouped together
here. They represent unquestionably the remnants of old aspects now
functionless and quite forgotten.
     ma-tcu'-, burn (tranF.), co'i-, burn (passive); ts3'i, flat object lies, otc-u'l,
lie on side; ma-hu', lie down, he'-k-i, flat object lies; mna-tsa'i, pour in, ma-tsu'le,
pour water in; nale""ec-a, be angry, nale""ec-a, get angry; o-w3'-ce, break in two,
ho-wa'-ce, break long object; me'sa-ki, bring (wild food), me'ca-ki, bring home;
pa'ti, cut open, ts*a-pu'tt, cut off; pa""e, burst of itself, p'e'i, chop, break; pi'-yete,
carry animals (dangling), u-ya'tc-, carry flat object; pi-ca'ya, carry stick in hand,
pi-cu'te, carry short objects; ma-we', carry long object, me-wi"", carry something
dangling; ho-ka'kai, crawl, ku'ye, run; ma-sa""-, cover up, so""to-, cover entirely;
tsi'pi, cut off, tc'o'pe, cut off: ote'-wi, be dead, t'o, kill; ts'ui, flay, tc-a-t'a'tt flay;
ome-wai'-ite, deliver a speech, wo'ti- be garrulous; na-ha'p, dance up and down,
o-hu'pi, dive (in water); huye'ka, be glad, haiya'ka, be glad; ca""e, go- quickly,
ct'la, go in quickly; ma-li'pi, pile up, o-le'pi, place; ce', blow (of wind), tcu't, blow
away; me-tu'l-, catch with net, t'ol-, catch in net; tsu""u-, roast in ashes, ma-tsi'u-,
roast on coals.
    These are but some of the numerous examples to be found in the
dictionary. That a series of gradations was originally indicated is
definitely suggested by the different ablaut grades met with in the same
stem. In most cases, of course, it has not been possible to obtain
66         University of California PubUcations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.         [Vol. 27translations of a sufficient degree of accuracy to show exactly what
the nature of these semantic differentiations was.
    A few examples must suffice:
     ma-p-e'li, roll; pame-po'le, roll up; pame-pi'le, roll up.
     co'i, burn; tc*u, burn; ts-i, sparks fly.
     ho-la'e, crack; ts'u-le'-tce, cut; lat-, hit.
     wi'hi, discuss; wai'-ite, deliver speech; wa'ti, be garrulous.
     ha-, say; hu-, say; ha'i-, say.
     hu-ke'hi, shove; ka'-c, shove; ke'ya-, push to one side.
     t'i'i, hold in hand; t'u'i, have in hand; o-ta'n, hold over coals; o-te'n, hand.
     to, touch, t'ul-, fondle. t-a-, fondle.
     ka, touch; huku'i-, bump head; -k'o 'ye-, crush.
     o-tco"", fall down; o-tsa'i-, tip it over; ma-tse'u-, drop.
     tca'te, scrape with fingers; ts'u'te, scrape pan; ca'te, scrape with knife.
     o-tc-u'l lie on one side; hu-si""le, lie on back; ts&'i, flat object lies.
     ma-tst'k, squirt water; ma-tsa'i, pour in (liquid?); ma-tsu'le, pour in water.
    8. Hortatory-subjunctive -a-.-That the terminal vowel of all dissyl-
labic stems must change to -a- for the hortatory admits of no exception.
The stem vowel of monosyllabic bases is apparently not effected.
Whether the -a- that appears irregularly in subjunctive forms is iden-
tical with this hortatory -a- it is difficult to prove but this is extremely
likely.
    (a) Hortative:
     tekuwa'yasi, let him run; itcoho'halasi, let me walk; tepa""asi, let him eat;
temo'kasi, let him drink.
     (b) Subjunctive:
     tsete'tu tse'w-a-sa, that they ask him; tehes-a'-laki, if you don't give him;
ma""omuy-a-lv'ktsel, when he disappears.
     This -a- also appears in the subjunctive -ta-.
    tecate't-a-si, he might comb; ma'a'nt-a-si, it might get rotten; hot'a't-a-si,
he might divide.
    The t-a forms are not found in the texts often and the -a- subjunc-
tive is on the whole not frequent. It would seem as if the subjunctive
is indicated not so much by change of terminal vowel to -a as by an
irregular vocalic mutation. Cf. discussion §72.
    9. Expanded or increment bases.-To the numerous changes in the
nature of the base wrought by vocalic and consonantal ablaut we must
add those transformations caused by the fusion of suffixes with the
original verb-stem. As we have pointed out before these suffixes belong
to distinct strata in the language. Some must have lost whatever
meaning they possessed at an early period, others are only half under-
stood and half functional today, while others are frequently used. As
1929]              Badin: A G-rammar of the Wappo Language                           67in very many instances these formatives are so firmly fused with the
stem that it is quite artificial to separate them, and as they have had,
after all, a long independent history, we shall treat the forms pos-
sessing them as definite bases and call them expanded and increment
forms.
    Some of the suffix-formatives are fairly clear, e.g., -te-, -ta-, -1, -c-,
-s-; others moderately felt like -hv, -wv, -yv, etc., while a long series,
the petrified suffixes, are quite vague. Examples will be found in the
section on verbal suffixes (§34-64). Here only a few instances will
be given:
    tsa'i-, tip over, tsul, tsel, turn over; kas, ka'tt, wear, wear around neck; tcoc,
tcohi, tca'yi, put; tc'a'tc', tcu-su'p, tc*ul, tc'ap-, ts'up-, take or related meanings.
    The reason for the disappearance of the older method of forming
aspects by vocalic and consonantal ablaut is to be ascribed to the
development of a large number of suffixes with aspect significance, to
the marked extension of such suffixes as the iterative and the con-
tinuative, and lastly, to the spread of the concept of tense. There
seems little question that such suffixes as -sv, -cV, -mi, -ki did not
originally have a predominatingly aspect connotation. The first three
were probably plurals and the last simply the past tense. What seems
to have taken place is the gradual transference to them of meanings
inherent in the vowel of the base. In some cases, as in a number of
indefinites in -sv, -or, the old ablauted vowel was preserved. Generally
it was lost. Perhaps the present development of the passive illustrates
exactly what occurred. Although -u- is beyond the shadow of a doubt
the sign of the passive and -ki merely the tense suffix, the idea of the
passive is being transferred to -ki to such an extent that passives are
now being formed without -u-.
    It is just conceivable that some of the old ablauted bases have been
preserved in the vowels of the indefinite suffixes for we have the series,
-mi, -me-, -ma; -se, -si, -sa; -ce, -ci, -ca, and -i, -a, -e.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]"
"                         §66. Indefinite Tense
   Here we are only concerned with the indefinite as it occurs today.
There are as we have seen ten methods of forming it:
    1. Vowel theme, -a, -e.
    2. -mi (-me).
    3. -se, -si, -sa.
    4. -ce, -ci, -ca.
    5. -(i)ya, -(a)ya.
    6. -ki.
    7. -ma, -ma.
    8. -la, -le, -li.
    9: Double formations.
   10. Irregular formations.
     37 Ultimately probably nothing to do with past specifically but referring to
indirect, invisible activity.
1929]              Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                        97    1. Vowel theme8.-Indefinites in vowel theme (-i, -a, -e) present
considerable difficulty. The vowel is clearly not a tense formative but
part of the stem. On the other hand it is obviously not the original
vowel. As practically all verbs in -i (-si, -mi) are transitive-active,
those in -a (-sa), causative, and those in -e (-se, -cc), intransitive-neuter,
we may confidently assume that these vowels are essentially modal-
aspect formatives. Indefinites in -a and -e are rare, the vast majority
ending in -i. Why, it may therefore be asked, has -i been preserved
and -a, -e lost? The answer is comparatively simple. -i was preserved
because it contained' a vowel that contrasted with the regular impera-
tive stem -e.
    It is extremely important to remember that the vowels of the
suffixes (-mi, -si, -Se, -sa -ce, -ci) are identical with the -i, -a, -e indefi-
nites and that the terminal vowel of stems taking -mi, -sV, -cv, -ya
undergo fairly extensive changes.
    Examples will be found in §53. Only a few will be given here.
    k-u'yi, he puts on; mali'hi, he pokes; maka'li, he roasts in oven; ma'me, he
gambles; hopats-e'li, he turns around; mewa'ya, he musses it up; nu'he, he is
jealous; nu'he, he robs (intransitive); pek-a'ohe, he slips.
    2. -mi, -me.-It is probably cognate with Yuki -am, -yam implying
continuative habitual activity and consequently being merely a variant
of collective -am. It might also possibly be equated with -mi of Wappo
plural imperatives. -melc passive contains this same suffix.
    In the overwhelming majority of cases -mi occurs only with trans-
itive verbs, but the idea of transitiveness is contained in the -i not in
the -m-. The variant -me is extremely rare and is suffixed to the in-
transitive. -mv frequently rounds the vowel preceding it. Not infre-
quently it occurs with a syncopated base. For examples cf. §53.
    S.-si, -sa, -se.-This is to be analyzed into -s- durative and -i,'-a,
-e transitive, causative-transitive, and intransitive respectively. -sv has
no influence upon preceding vowel, but owing to its durative force it
is at times found with durative and with syncopated base. Examples
will be found in §53. The contrast in force of -si, -sa, -se is seen in the
following forms:
    cuka'lt-si, he drags it; e'lu-sa, he keeps hold of it; omv'ki-se, he lies.
    4. -c, -ca, -ce.-Here we have formations analogous to the pre-
ceding, -v- being the usitative-durative followed by modal-aspect -i, -a,
-e. Both -ci and -ca have however developed. the secondary meaning
of ""become"" and in the large majority of the cases appear with that
meaning. Cf. examples §53.
    omik e'uci, it becomes daylight; amisa'mci, it becomes evening; amal-utcuwa-ca,
it becomes dark; e'la-ca, it gets deep.
98            University of California Publicoations in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.      [Vol. 27     -ci has preserved its original usitative-transitive force in
     o'ti-ci, he sucks; otst'pi-ci, he paints it red.
    -ce has preserved its original significance of intransitive-neuter-
usitative.
     ce'-ce, wind blows; ct'ts-ce, it is wet; ha'ku-ce, he is hungry; coVi-ce, it is burnt.
    -cv has no influence upon preceding vowel but frequently occurs
with syncopated base.
    5. -(i)ya, -ya.-(For examples cf. §53). In origin this is the auxiliary
verb to go. It has lost that force today and retained mainly the general
significance of continuous, durative action. At times only a vague
implication of its durative meaning remains, as in ho-E'wi-ya, he is
ignorant of, and o'manots'e'wi-ya, he is afraid. It seems to appear
mainly with the durative base of the stem (-i) and also regularly changes
a terminal -e of the stem to -a- or -ai-.
    ke'ha-ya, he lies down (*kehe); ha'wa-ya, he rests (*hawe); hucuha'i-ya, it
steams (*hucuhe); hokakai'ya, he crawls (*hokake).
    6. -ki (-ke, -ka).-Indefinites in -ki give the impression of being
pasts. They were in fact first interpreted as such. It is fairly clear
however that they are either stems in -k- followed by -i, -e, or far more
likely, survivals of the old force of -ki still quite definitely felt in Yuki
and preserved in Wappo in the adjective conjugation. In Yuki -ki, -ek,
-k is the present tense. In Wappo strictly analogous forms occur, -ki,
-ke, -k. Unquestionably -ki (-k-i) was originally transitive and -k-c
intransitive. Today, however, they have fallen together, -ki prevailing
with an intransitive meaning. Still, in such forms as hola""eki, he
cracks open, and hopi'hilike, he shakes (intransitive), the old force
of -ki and -ke seem to survive.
    Since we are justified in analyzing -kv- into -k-i and -k-e, it is ex-
tremely likely that like -m-, -s-, -c- it had, at one time, a definite non-
temporal significance. It may have implied continuance as suggested
by Kroeber for -ek, in Yuki.38 We may consequently equate it with
the -ku- of Wappo plural imperatives.
     oli""tca-ki, it is full; hutce""uk, he is glad; ca'si-ki, he sits down; mak'i'-i-ke,
he places in cradle; cutt'n-ki, he stoops; mapa'-ki, he shoots through; hai'ya-ka,
he is glad; mapo'n-ki, he locks up; hawe-ki, he takes rest; pitaki'ya-ke (water)
is cool; ho'l-ki, he stands.
   7. -ma, -mao.-It is very doubtful whether -ma and -ma, although
cognate, belong together with -mi, -me. -ma is very rare and need not
     38   This series, 9:362.
1929]               1adin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                            99detain us. -ma is clearly the continuative-progressive suffix with
intransitive force.          r
    oka""-ma, he informs; ce 'p'u-ma, he limps along; hoku'yL-ma, he dives around;
pu'lu-ma, he runs along; mewi'-ma, he goes along.
     8. -a, -le, -li.-These are simply the continuative -1- with the modal-
aspect formatives -i, -a, -e. With the exceptiQn of -la and occasionally
-le, it is somewhat difficult to decide whether we are dealing with true
indefinite tenses or participles. It is fairly safe to assume that whatever
participial force they have today is secondary. -la and -le are often
difficult to distinguish from passive and semi-reflexive -la, -le. It is
rarely conceivable that these two suffixes are related.
    okalai'yc-le, he crawls; ca'te-le, it twitches; li'pe-le, he kills many; mata'ya-la,
he wades; temetse'la-li, they hit; tucu'ya-le, throwing it toward; tek-ane'-li,
packing them; holi'wa-la, chasing them.
   9. Double formations.-A few verbs have more than one suffix for
the indefinite. For examples and interpretation cf. §64, 1.
   10. Irregular formations.-A few verbs are found with terminal
stem reduplication in the indefinite only. They are all iterative in
meaning.
    pe'tsetsesi, it is shining (pe'tse); ts-i'kikisi, he squirts (ts-i'ki); tW'titLsi, it
shakes (tUti).","[105, 106, 107, 108]"
"                                 §27. Ablaut
    Both vocalic and consonantal ablaut occur, the latter however
quite vestigial, although at one time it may be assumed to have played
an important r6le. Today one or two forms distinguish their transitive
and intransitive, or their passive and active in this manner. Vocalic
ablaut on the contrary is functional, although today clearly not to the
same extent as formerly. It is employed to differentiate tense, mode,
voice, occasionally aspect, and plurality. Its use in tenses and in the
imperative is quite secondary. Its employment for mode, voice, aspect,
and general plurality it represents one of the oldest traits of the lan-
guage. Today we find the following specific vowel mutations:
   -u-, passive and semi-passive.
   -a-, hortatory.
   -a-, and irregular change, subjunctive.
   Irregular change, plural.
   -i-, durative (not common).
   -i, indefinite of many verbs (secondary).
   Irregular change, indefinite of many verbs (secondary).
   -e, imperative of many verbs (secondary).
   They are all discussed in some detail in §§65-88.
26       University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27                    §28. Complete Stem-Differentiation
    It is quite erroneous, I believe, to dismiss complete stem-differen-
tiation to the limbo of the vocabulary. It is far better to regard it as
a distinct process. In a language where the initial consonant, the basic
stem vowel, and the terminal stem vowel can be altered, what appears
to be complete stem-differentiation might, very well, have not been
that in origin. However there can be little doubt that in the vast
majority of cases, where different stems are found for singular and
plural, for round and for long objects, etc., these are all quite unrelated
and due to idiomatic crystallizations, etc. In Wappo the distinction
between singular and plural is expressed by completely unrelated stems
not only for verbs, but for a few adjectives and occasionally for the
relative pronoun. The classification of activities in relation to round,
long, and short objects, to singular and plural, etc., is largely accom-
plished by the same means.
                           §29. Reduplication
    Reduplication is a process conspicuous, with a few exceptions, by
its almost total absence. The suffix -tEte is used to form redundant
nominal plurals and two or three verbs have reduplicated forms either
in the indefinite or past. That it existed formerly, however, is attested
by a large number of examples from the vocabulary.
                         §30. Stem-Composition
    Stem-composition as such plays no great role in the verbs. In so far
as many of the prefixes and some of the suffixes are essentially com-
posite in character it must, after a fashion, be regarded as occurring
today and to have been perhaps of a more distinctively functional
value formerly. Anything however comparable to the initial and sec-
ondary stems of Yana, Northern Maidu, and, to a lesser degree, of
Achomawi, Southwestern Pomo, and apparently Washo, is quite
unknown.
                    §31. Change in Position of Accent
    The change in position of accent found only in the future of some
verbs is, to a certain extent, functional but not of great importance.
    It has been found impracticable to treat the verbal and the nominal
grammatical processes together. The latter will therefore be treated
in the section on the noun.
    Similar considerations have made it necessary to transfer the whole
complicated discussion of vowel ablaut, stem-differentiation, etc., to
the sections on the morphology of the verb (cf. §§45-88).

                 §§32-33. PREFIXATION IN THE VERB
                    §32. Introduction and List of Prefixes
     Prefixation is an old but still living grammatical process in Wappo.
That it is old is proved by the nature and use of the local prefixes
(nos. 20-37 below), by the instrumental me-, the pronominal me-, te-,
and the indefipite objects ho- and ma-. Of these only me- instrumental
has an independent existence as a noun stem. The others are only
found as prefixes. That, on the other hand, prefixation is still an active
process is evidenced by the nature and behavior of such prefixes as
cu-, after; o'mi, weather; hLn-, sleep; wil, body, and perhaps even hu-,
head, etc.-all of which can be best designated as nouns and verbs
in varying conditions of transformation from an independent existence
to that of proclitics and prefixes. cu-, for instance, is a verb stem (cu'i)
little used at present, which has unquestionably become a true prefix
with specialized meaning. ami and hLn are noun stems still frequently
used as such. They are strictly speaking more of the nature of proclitics
than prefixes. But even here there are gradations, for ami is unques-
tionably becoming more of a real prefix than hLn, as is best indicated
by the change from original ama to o'mi. wil- and hu- are likewise
nouns of which the first is only an incorporated noun, rarely used, the
second a frequently used incorporated noun that is beginning to lose
its original meaning and to develop a semi-instrumental significance.
    If, however, it must be admitted that prefixation is a living process
in Wappo today, that need not necessarily imply that such develop-
ments as cu- and o'mi- are a direct continuation of the same tendency
toward prefixation which gave rise to the local and pronominal prefixes.
It is on the contrary likely that there was a definite break between
these two periods; and that Wappo, during that interval, lost a number
of prefixes (these being possibly felt as the suffixes of pronouns and
nouns), that this period of ""prefixal"" decay was then arrested, and a
new ""prefixal"" tendency giving us cu-, etc., inaugurated. In Yuki
and Huchnom apparently this decay persisted until suffixation became
the only functional process.
    With regard to the fusion of prefixes with the verb-stem, little need
be said. What exists is slight and of no particular significance and is
due to the slurring-of the vowel of the prefix, conditioned first, by the
influence of contiguous vowels and consonants and secondly, by the
28       University of CaZifornia Publcations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27fact that the main accent is almost always on the verb-stem. There is
one point, however, in this connection, of extreme importance. The
vowels of the prefixes me- (local), tc*a- and, to a lesser extent, pa-, te-
(local), ho- (local) and na- (local), vary considerably. We find, for
instance, me-, ma-, mo-, ma-, mu-, me-; tc-a-, tc-o-, tc u-, tc e-; pa-,
pa-; te-, to-, tu-; ho-, hu-, ha-; na-, no-; and, at times, such forms as
ha'a-, ma'a-, ta',-, na'a-. As we know that many Wappo verbs began
with initial vowel, it would be most natural to interpret most of these
mutations as due to the influence of this vowel, now lost in numerous
cases. Such an interpretation would not, however, explain why pi-
and na- (mouth) are not affected and why the prefixes show such marked
differences in the nature of their vowel changes. Clearly a supplemen-
tary hypothesis must be added, and to me the most likely one and that
suggested by certain semantic differentiations is that, in some instances,
phonetically identical prefixes are quite unrelated, and that in other
cases, we are dealing with slight shades of meaning indicated by vowel-
ablaut. That there are a number of utterly unrelated ma- (local) and
te- (local) prefixes we know, and that me-, me- (with the hand), pos-
sibly pa-, pa- (together), represent slight changes in meaning, is ex-
tremely likely. Whether, however, the whole range tca-, tc-o-, tc u-,
tc e-, for instance, implies four gradations in significance is, nevertheless,
quite unlikely.
    In short it seems extremely likely that the three factors mentioned
above have all been operative in the development of the vowel ablaut
of prefixes, although owing to confusion of homonyms with each other
and the influence of analogy it is well-nigh impossible, in many in-
stances, to determine which of the three has been operative in any
given case. I am inclined to believe that phonetically irregular fusion
of prefix with initial stem-vowel has been the most, and semantic vowel
mutation the least, frequent cause for the mutation.
    As we might expect, a definite order is observable in the position
of the prefixes to which there is no exception. This order is of con-
siderable significance for the history of prefixation in Wappo in that it
suggests that the nearer we approach to the verb-stem the older the
particular prefix is likely to be. It is moreover of some value in the
interpretation of certain prefixes whose meaning and force is vague.
For instance te-, often used with the imperative, loses a good deal of
its uncertainty in meaning when it can be shown to occupy the same
position as the pronominal elements, for then its explanation as a
specialized aspect of te- (Latin eius) seems fairly well fixed. Similarly
whatever doubts may have existed as to the age of na- (with the
1929]             Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                        29mouth), is dissipated when it is seen that it belongs to the group me-
 (with the hand), pe- (with the foot). At the same time our attitude
toward hu-, head (cf. above) is reinforced when we find it grouped
with me- (instrumental), and not with omi-, hLn-, etc.
     The prefixes appear in the following order:
     First position: te- (eius), me- (suus), mai'-, ho- (it), ma- (it), on-.
     Second position: hLn-, o'mi-, ho- (begin), wil-, ku-, te- (come).
     Third position: tc-a-.
     Fourth position: ma-, me-, mo-, mu- (all local), pa-, pa-, te-, te-
 (local), na- (local).
     Fifth position: me- (with hand), na- (with mouth), pe- (with foot),
wi- (general instrumrentality), hu- (head), cu-.
     Sixth position: na- (idiomatic), pi-, pv- (?).
     The place held by the pronominal prefixes is significant. There are
two such groups, the possessive-reflexive (te-, me-, mai'-) and the pro-
nominal objects (ma-, ho-, on-). te- always precedes me-. The former
group always precede the latter, and this suggests that the verb is
apparently conceived of as a noun. In the discussion on syntax we
shall know that in narratives it is treated as a semi-nominalized con-
struction, a possessed object, and that te-, me-, and mai'- also have
the force of relative pronouns. This is apparently an old type of con-
struction in Yukian for Kroeber seems to imply it in what he says of
Yuki proper.'6
     ma- and ho- had perhaps best be interpreted as old proclitic vari-
ants of demonstratives ma- from *me, this, and ho- from he-, the first
set probably not related to the possessive me-. Their development into
prefixes I regard as most certainly due to the nominalizing influence
of te-, me-, and mai'-, and is not at all to be ascribed to any tendency
toward fusion between ho- and ma- and the verb-stem itself. In other
words these prefixes are not of the same order as the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth position elements.
     on- is undoubtedly a recent development and shows quite nicely
how te- etc., welded all the elements that came after it into a more or
less indissoluble phonetic unit. This must have been largely encouraged
by the comparative phonetic- weakness of on- as contrasted with its
original form of ani, the -i of which was apparently.felt as a subjective
case, thus leading to its irregular loss in order to form the objective.
    16 ""An idiom of the language
                                     [Yukil provides the use of the subject in the
objective case for a large class of verbs. When such verbs are transitive the
objec1C is put in the possessive case."" This series, 9:371.
30       University of Colifornia Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27     The second position elements need not detain us. They are strictly
speaking proclitics whose fusion with the verb is being accelerated by
the force of first position te-, me-, mai'-.
    The third and fourth position elements are all adverbial, unrelated
to any stems existing in Wappo today and clearly among the oldest
prefixes in the language. It is with these that the composite verb unit
can be said to begin, for the first and second position elements give the
impression of being partially proclitic. ttemewilts'awil, she fondled him,
has the feeling of temewil ts'awil, a possessed noun followed by a verb.
This seemingly proclitic force of the first position elements when pre-
ceding the second position elements is however quite secondary. From
the nature of the case the local prefixes in third and fourth position
only occurred with verb-stems and they thus resisted any secondary
disintegrating tendency. They were protected, we may hazard to
believe, from developing secondarily into nominal suffixes by their
position after the possessive pronominal elements. It is true that they
precede the instrumentals (me-, 'pe, na-, wi-) but these latter are only
vaguely regarded as nouns and are so intimately associated with the
verb activity that a separation from the verb-stem proper and a grouping
with the third and fourth position elements would be felt as quite
preposterous. For instance, oniapiwa'tasi, he-stamped-with-the-foot,
could never split up into omapi and watasi.
    Two of the fifth position elements are non-instrumental, cu- and
hu-, and require some explanation. The verbs with these prefixes can
best be interpreted as old composita whose prefixed element is beginning
to be felt as adverbial and as detachable. This is at least the case for
cu- and explains why it is separated from the stem when pi- (near),
na- (idiomatic), and pv- (by sucking) are used. In other words as soon
as cu- was felt as an adverb it took the position occupied by adverbial
prefixes in the composite verb. hu- apparently has not yet reached
that stage.
    In the fifth position, with two exceptions, we have only instrumen-
tals. They are all slight variants of nouns still extensively used. Their
instrumental function is quite clear and they are rarely treated as noun
subjects or objects. In origin they must certainly have been of the
type still largely exemplified by hu-, but their transformation into
instrumentals belongs to an old period of the language.
    1. cu-, to follow, after, back, off.
    This prefix seems an excellent example both of an old compound
and of a verb-base in the process of decay. We meet it as an inde-
pendent' verb-stem, as a semi-independent adverb, and as a true ad-
1929]'            Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                           31verbial prefix. Its function as a prefix is probably quite recent for it is
found only with certain verbs. But as an incorporated verb it is quite
old. It is however fairly rapidly coming into more extensive use as
an adverbial prefix and seems, at the same time, to be developing into
a nominal suffix.
    ancu'wi, he followed them; mai'cu""u mak'u'uki', he ran back (literally,
himself-back he ran).
   This is an exceedingly interesting intermediate stage. Notice also
the phonetic transformation from cuwv> cu'u.
    mai'cu""u tet-a'make, he swam back (himself-back he swam); mecu'welki, he
went back (here cu- is clearly a full-fledged prefix and definitely felt to be such
because me- precedes it); cuku'ptki, he tumbled off; cutL'lki, he stooped; cutt'nki,
he stooped; cuk'a'le, he drags; cut'u'i, it is hanging; cupehe'teski, he held (his
hands) behind his back; cuyetcL'ski, he carried on his back.
    2. omi-, omo-, referring to weather, natural phenomena, etc.
    This is clearly derived from oma, earth, in its secondary meaning
of world. In all probability its present force is a recent and secondary
development and some of the verbs given below also appear without it.
That it is, however, becoming firmly fused with the verb-stem, is shown
by its form amo- due to the influence of following o or u.
    omima'kce, it is raining; omihoke'wtki, he saw daylight; omico'iyaci, it became
hot (from the sun); omice""ce, (wind) blows; omisa'mike, it became evening;
amo-utcu'waske, it became dark; omitco'ke, it sprouted.
   3. htn-, referring to sleep.
   The noun htn, sleep, seems to be acquiring the force of an instru-
mental prefix.
     htnka'tece, he snores (he makes noise by sleeping); htnpi'kali, he is sleepy
(he is pricked by sleep); hintsa'telki, he wakes up (he is shaken from sleep);
hintco""me, he sleeps; hinto'ke, he is asleep (he is struck by sleep); hinitca'se, he
is sleepy (he is sick with sleep).
This last is felt as a definite unit although its form shows it to be a
noun with the instrumental suffix -i followed by a verb.
   4. ku-, to believe, assert.
   It is probably merely a form of ka to talk, but may be regarded as
having in the main lost its independent existence although not quite
as completely as those mentioned above.
   a'kuhu'ttca, I'm crazy, I believe; a'kutca'se, I'm sick, I believe; a'kuhuci'iyake,
I'm good, I believe; htnku-a'toki, I was asleep, I believe.
This last example shows how the language seems still to be wavering
between regarding htn as a true noun and a semi-prefix. That h&nto'ki
32         University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.    [Vol. 27is really a definite and indivisible verb is best proved by the fact that
the juxtaposition of hLn, sleep, and to, to strike, as such does not mean
anything.""7
    5. pu-, to blow, to puff, to suck.
     pv'tsomi, he kisses; opv'taki, he drinks water (by sucking it up).
    6. wil-, body.
    This is only rarely used as a ""prefix."" However its use as a nominal
suffix meaning ""against"" is quite common.
     tewilts'a'wil, she fondles him; wil-tu'l'i, she fondles him.
   7. ho-, to begin. (?)
   Although the following forms were consistently given a number of
times I feel rather doubtful about them. If this prefix really exists it is
a shortened form of ohoi-te'-sa, to begin.
    ohotai""yaomi, I'm going to begin to sing; hotco'holyaomi, I'm going to begin
to walk; ahoka'l-teyaomi, I'm going to begin to speak.
    8. te-, te-, to come.
    As in the case of ho-, to begin, I feel that in spite of the rather
numerous examples obtained in which it was consistently translated
as to come, te- is to be regarded as extremely doubtful. I suspect that
it is an idiomatic use of te- (§35). If it really is a prefix it may be a
variant of t'o, to come, confused and assimilated with te-.
    atele'uce, I come and get it; teli'he, come and push! (it is especially common
with the imperative); atenu'Lmike, I come and steal it (here it may be simply-
""it""); atet'o'lmiki, I come and kill it (cf. above); teku'wtki, he came running,
otepo'tti', come and eat!; ts'u'k'tti', come and drink; tsk'u'we, come and run;
te'tco, come and walk; tewi'iti, come and fight.
   9. hu-, head.
   It is always an old incorporated noun that is felt here. That it is
however fused with the verb-stem is clearly brought out by the examples.
While never used as an instrumental it belongs to the same group as
me- (10), pe- (11), na- (13).
    hup'e'niski, he carried on his head; huku'ice, he bumped his head; huka'lice,
he thinks (head-hurts); hukt'tise, he is dizzy (head-moves?); huka'l*ce, he forgets;
huka'ya, he guesses; ihu-ika'lice, I have a headache (me-head-me-hurts).
In the last example hu is felt as an independent noun as indicated by
the repetition of i, I, objective. Had it been felt as a noun with normal
force, the first i would not have been used.
    17 If it were really felt as two words we should have expected sleep-strikes-me,
with the objective form of the first person pronoun.

   This is apparently an old instrumental prefix and in only a few
cases is the stem employed as an object.
    mepi'tceski, he folded his arms; meku'yeski, he had his hands in his pocket;
meca't'tki, he had his fingers entwined; mehe'ye, he ground it between two objects
(with his hand); metsa'pLki, he grabbed it (with hand); meti'le, he rings; ts--
ametsi'e, he wrings it; mai'mewa'le, he scours; meko'e, he strings it; mewl""ti, to
catch with hand; mek*a', to feel with hand; meko'tce, he tickles (with fingers);
mewe'ma, he picks up long object with hand; mema'numa, he picks up flat object
with hand; mek-a'luma, he picks up concave object with hand; metce'n, he catches
it with stick, etc. (general instrumentality).
    11. pe-, pi-, foot.
    Like me- an old instrumental prefix although still used as object.
    pite'kdta, he tripped; peha'mcl, step over object; pet'a'cl, to step; pet'a'ola,
to hold out leg; pek-a'ohe, to slip; pik-o'iyi, he crushes by stamping; omapiwa'tasi,
he stamped with the foot; pik*a""ta, he touched with the foot; pitsa'pise, he mashed
with foot; piyai'ytsi, he thumped with foot.
    12. na-, no-, mouth, with the mouth.
    An old prefix only vaguely felt as an incorporated noun.
    a'napico'liya, I whisper; a'napa'lse, I scream; nawa'lsi, to halloo; honats*a'se,
he yawns: nats'o'l, to chew; namu't*e, to suck candy: nahu'e, to teach; honats*a'se,
to yawn; naka""e, to bite; naka't*e, to strike with mouth, teeth; nawe'leski, he
carried in, (with), mouth; nopa'lse, he yelled.
    13. wi-, meaning unknown.
    Perhaps the general meaning of ""by some force,"" ""by pulling.""
    wi'k'el, to bite off (cf. k*e'li, to eat soup); howi't'e, to iron (to flatten with
instrument?) (cf. ote'l-, to flatten); wi'tctti, to sweep (analysis into wi+tct con-
jectural); howt'tstki, he shoots with arrow.
    14. o-, ho-. This prefix has a large variety of meanings and uses
and is probably a variant of he, this. It is used as the indefinite object
of tiansitive verbs; as the indefinite subject of intransitive, inactive,
and static frequently implying impersonal causation; with the passive;
with the semi-passive, and middle voice; and with the causative.
As phonetically it is identical with ho-, adverbial prefix, and o- or ho-,
an old initial vowel of many verb-stems, it may at. times have been
confused with these.
    (a) Indefinite object.
    hotca'e, split it! (tca'e, to split); hok'e'tce, chop it! (k'etce, to chop); hok'L'ne,
tear it! (k'iTne, to tear); opu'ye, he blew it; ohi""ti, bury!; ohe'ye, he sharpens it.
    (b) Indefinite subject.
    ota'yaki, it is heavy; heliotco'ke, it is hot (from fire); hotst'tLmi, it is squeak-
ing; otci'tcaki, it is dark; hana'nvk, it is open; ots'a'piki, it bursts; hate""ce, it
melts (it becomes water).
34         University of California Publications in Anm. Arch. and Ethn.    [Vol. 27     (c) With passive, generally implying agent.
    ola'tike, he was hit by somebody; uotaltsike, he had been hit by somebody;
aowa'timele, I'm going to be hit by them; aomali'hele, I'm going to be pushed
by somebody; aopo'i'le, I will be kicked by them; aok'a'lemele, I'm being hurt;
aoke'tcele, I'm being cut; aotsoi'mele, I'm being smashed; aohe'k'ele, I'm being
shaved; aopu'ts&mele, I'm being kissed by them.
     (d) With causatives.
    hotteti, to draw tight (make tight); aok'e'ntsi, I make it long; aomi'tesi,
I make it shorter; tsepi otu't'cmi, he makes it large; aotsa'ttsi, I make it cold;
aotca'p,si, I make it warm.
     (e) Semi-passive and middle voice.
    omewi""le, he tells a story; ohi'le, he builds a house; oye'ti, to set a snare;
omeha'ye, to collect debts; ok*o'ye, to knead; oc&'kaltk, to be stingy; oka'ttmi,
to hitch up.
    15. ma-. Indefinite object of transitive verb and indefinite subject
of active-intransitive and semi-passives; agent of passive verbs. It has,
in short, all the meanings of ho-. It may possibly have been confused
with ma-, adverb (§26).
    (a) Indefinite object.
     mawi""iti', hang it up!; ma'u'ki', drink it!; mapa""e, eat it!; male'k'e, swallow
it!; mahi'we, move it!; mats'u'ti', burn it!
      (b) Indefinite subject, etc.
    mapika'hasi, it squeaks; mapi'waki, he slides on ice; make'yaki, he slides on
a board; mata""osa, he tells an untruth; mamu'is, to think; ma'e'name, he is afraid;
a'mapa'okusi, I might be eaten by them; a'mapa'omele, I was eaten by him;
a;mama'nukLsi, I might be taken by them; napo'n-leksi, he will be locked up
by them.
   16. me-, he, him.
   This is, in reality, merely a specialized use of the possessive pro-
noun, its fundamental function being to indicate that the subject of
the sentence is the same as the subject of the preceding sentence.
    tsehe'teski me'tse pat-a menat'a'aki, he carried arrows and then he arrived.
    tco'haki e'we mek'a'l-ta, he came and took his spear.
    tc*atc'o'kati pat-a met'e'ima tc-amet-o'yel, he came up from the bottom
and floated on top.
    omule'k-tta pat.a mele'pumokta, ""I'm going to see,"" so then he got up.
    teot'o'tta pat-a mece'cukwen, he (eius) shot him and then he (subject of pre-
ceding sentence) was hit.
    tse'pi metsa'mxta hata, he said he did it (subject of ""said"" and ""did"" are
alike).
    tememecu'ttta, she jerked him, i.e., she, subject of preceding sentence, jerked
him (eum).

    This is simply the possessive pronoun te. with the force of the Latin
eius. It indicates that the subject of the verb is different from that of
the preceding sentence.'8
    nale'ecukla'ki temeha'ita, he (elk) did not get angry that he (coyote) had
fooled him.
    ona tso'kace teka't'ice, then elk laughed at him (coyote).
    pat-a pa""mi . . . . ona me'teti a'we tehe'yaki, then they (the men) ate and
afterwards the women ate potatoes.
    mewe'le ... o'tsetu' heta o'ni tetco""me, he (grandfather) told me.
that's why they come here.
    tse'pi tetsa'm-ta, he said he did it (subject of ""said"" and ""did"" different).
    tememecu""tLta, she jerked him (cf. last example of mc-).
    18. on-, them (human beings).
    This is the objective form of ani, they (literally ""people""), and I
include it here as a prefix because it has lost its independent existence
and distinctly belongs phonetically to the verb-stem, just as the sub-
jective form ani clearly does not.
    ancu'wi, he followed them; onme'sa, he divided them; ankatt'ci maka""ce,
I heard them snore; ant'o'he, he kills them; onhu'mi, they taught them; anunama'-
ktsel, where they lived.
(In subordinate clauses the objective form is used subjectively.)
   19. mai-, reflexive, semi-passive, and idiomatic.""9
    mai'ota'n-ta, they warmed themselves; amai'owa'ttta, I hit myself; amaitt'-
o'ta, I killed myself; amai'op'o'ita, I kicked myself; maimote'pi, she lay down;
maihope'li, he is rolling; maihantso'ice, she felt sorry; amait'o'helake, I never
killed anyone; mai'oke't*a, he is lean; mai'oku'yi, he puts his clothes on; mai'-
omekaVttsi, to squirm; mai'hutsitsi""umi, he winks.
   20. ho-, o-, around, out, and idiomatically.
   This is an old prefix and is firmly fused with the verb-stem. It is
at times difficult to keep it apart from ho- prefix 21 and from ho-
vowel auslaut.
   holi'he, he pushes it out; hok-a'le, he pulls it out; hopepu't.e, to handle and
stir up; owo'le, he stirs it up; hots'o'e, he flies around; hota'mala, to swim around;
hono'mel, to travel around; hote""Lki, he spread over; homets i'e, to wring clothes
(twist around with hand); mai'ole'ttta, he wound it around; hole'we, to hunt.
    21. ho-, o-, down, and idiomatic.
    This is quite distinct from ho- around, although occasionally con-
fused with it.
    ope'nce, he fell down; oku'yumokta, he dived down; ohu'ptki, he ducked;
ont'cta, he tumbled; oku'hel, to stoop; oyo'kaki; he sat down; ola'ttta, he hit it
(on the ground).
    18 An identical construction is found in Winnebago, w- being the prefix cor-
responding to m-. The verb without any prefix implies that the subject is different.

    The force of this prefix, which is quite distinct from 21 and 22, is
difficult to give. It has the value of ""along"" in such a phrase as ""run
along now,"" and for that reason had best be interpreted as a kind of
emphatic.
    ahoma'kse, I'm going along; hotco'hel, to walk along; ok-u'yuktsi, they might
run along; owa'lala, (animal) walks along; otai""eti, sing along!; opa""e, eat along!
owi'ye, fight along!
   23. ho-, o-, idiomatic.
   It is difficult to determine whether we are here dealing with an old
o- ausladtt that is now disappearing so that the same verb appears
sometimes with and sometimes without it, or whether we are dealing
with highly specialized meanings of 20, 21, and 22.
    oce'hasa, he guesses; oka'li, he talks; opa't'e, he shouts; ho-e'wuce, he is
ignorant; hoke""mi, he gives the war-cry; homata'osa, he pretends; hotce'ti, to
sing together.
    24. hu-, meaning not clear.
    A number of distinctly different suffixes may be involved here, such
as hu, head, or variants of ho-. In some cases we may simply be dealing
with an original stem in hu- (u-), while in other cases the -u- may be
due to assimilation with the following vowel.
    humu'tsoce, it twinkles (homu'tsoce?); ahule'kel, I peep in; hucu'haiya, it is
steaming (hocu'haiya?); huna""se, he carries on shoulder; husi""le, he lies on his
back; huso'haki, it is ended; husa'aki, he is tired; huci'aki, he gets well; hutsa'tise,
he gets well; huwa'omi, it sticks out; huwa'tsumi, he holds fingers entwined;
huye'kese, he is glad.
     25. ma-, 20 me-, off, out, through, across.
    mali""ta, he pushed out, off; map'o'ita, he kicked off; mahe'tati, he packed
it away; mata'm-se, he swims across; maku'ise, he comes out; mahi'nteke, he
could get across; meca'te, to scoop out earth; metcu'l-mi, he takes it off; mele'k*eta,
he peeped out.
     26. ma-, me-, up, back, and idiomatic. Quite distinct from 25.
     mala'ttta, he hit it above; mawa'ttta, he hit with clenched fists above; map-o'-
ita, he kicked above; mahe'weke, he jumped up; mape'le, to roll up; mapo'naktsi,
he might be locked up; map.e'le, to roll up; mawe'lelki, he went back; mame'si,
he takes home; mahe'tati, to carry home; mema'teti, pile it up!; imeta'maktsel,
when I swam back; mep'o'ita, he pushed it up!; mepu'laiya, (bubbles) are blown up.
     27. ma-, in. Quite distinct from 25 and 26.
     make'ktta, she threw in; maka'nta, they took in; masa'tumi, he threw soft
object in; mawi'lta, he put inside; mako'l*ta, he roasted in oven; matco'oki, she
threw it in; mato'yati, to wade in water; mapa'k'ti, to make a hole in, to penetrate.

    This me- has probably nothing to do with ma- or its variants and
owing to its apparent use with intransitive semi-reflexive verbs might
best be regarded'as a secondary use of the possessive or, less likely, as
a variant of mai-.
    meci'k'ece, to breathe; mele'pise, he is exhausted; melo'k'eye, he is limber;
memets'ai'mi, he is leaning (intransitive); mewi'lce, he tells; metco'tc'se, she is
unwilling; metsa'p.ce, he dislikes; mewa'tsise, he trades; metca'tki, it sprouted;
mepa'usi, it dropped; meka'kacki, he is pale; mamehe'lesi, he is in a hurry.
   29. me-, on, up, and idiomatic.
   In certain cases it is clearly a variant of ma-, me-, up; in others, a
variant of me-, with the hand; while in others its meaning is not clear.
     meya'elke, he climbs on tree; menatsa'kese, he holds his head up; mesa'wtsi,
he smooths; meca't'tki, he held fingers entwined; tcamekt'te, to unravel; tcomepi'-
ne, to turn wrongside out; mewe'laiya, he bumps; meyo'kese, he gets up; meyo'koti,
to cook.
   30. mo-, mD-, mu-,2' out, around, up, and idiomatic.
   A variant of 'ma- 25, 26, and 27, and at times a contraction of ma-
with an initial o- of stem.
    omohope'se, he looked around (perhaps better analyzed as omi-, prefix 2,
hope'se); mopu'laki, he is puffed up; mota'kak, to be puffed up; mopi'lak, he filled
up; a'monaco'telsi, I'll drink up; monac&'tumi, he pares off; omohule'kusi, he
peeped out; momu'yelki, he sank; motca'ki, he settled down; omoci'li, he drilled
a hole; omocu'ttti, to make a shade; matsi""i, to draw legs up; m&'otcu'lusele,
turning from one side to other; mule'keta, he peeped out; muk'i"", to pluck out;
mamu'yelki, he disappeared (ma-m-oyel); muso""mi, he is at the end.
   31. na-, again, around, up.
   This is possibly a variant of ona, again, although it is also con-
ceivable that two prefixes are involved here, one meaning ""around""
and derived from ona and the other meaning ""up.""
     a'naye'mtse, I play around; a'naca""ise, I jump around; nahi'lise, he is swinging;
namo'ise, it itches; napit'u'husi, it drizzles (na-, again; pi- diminutive activity;
t'u, water; -hu- petrified suffix); nata""ete, to bounce up; naha'pite, to dance up
and down; menats.a'kel, to hold head up; nasu'tila, to hold head in hands; nata'-
m-uta, he lay on his stomach; nata'mpteki, he fell on his stomach; naka'teke, it
blooms; namv'tstsi, he sharpens; na'ot'a'omi, he fills up; na'atcsai'ice, it has a
pleasant taste.
    32. na-, meaning not clear.
    nat'o'aki, he arrives (t'o'aki, to come).
    21 Maidu (cf. Dixon, B. A. E., Bulletin 40) has an identical variation of the
vowel of verbal prefixes, sometimes signifying apparently no change in meaning,
sometimes indicating a considerable difference. In Maidu, as in Wappo, we are
clearly dealing with two distinct things, first utterly unrelated prefixes whose
vowels have become assimilated, and second, vowel mutations of the same prefix
implying slight differences in meaning.
38         University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.          [Vol. 27     33. pa-, po-, together.
    papo'tciti, to tie string together; pamepi'le, to fold; pali'he, to push together;

powe'lta, he wrapped up.
     34. pi-, near, proximity, diminutive activity.
     This stem also appears as a nominal suffix -piya.
    pimo'nomvkta, she hid it near-by; pika'la, to listen (hear-closely); pik'a'li,
to hurt (k'a'li, wound); pitsa'pice, he grabs (seize-directly); a'napica'liy , I

have, catch); piwa'thci, he wakes him up (he shakes him).
    35. te-, in, toward, over, back, after.
    There are probably two distinct prefixes involved here, te-, in, and
te-, toward, etc. The latter is obviously a variant of tu-, toward,
used as nominal suffix and as enclitic.
    tetu'leki, (sun) shines in; teta'm.'se, he swims in; temawi'ita, he grabbed in
the air; teku'ise, he came in; teteta""asi, let him step in; tek-a'lse, he brings it

he arrived there; teha'p'e, blow here!; tema'ni, bring it here!; tewL'lumi, he builds.
    Used in a rather idiomatic sense we find this same prefix with the
probable force of toward, etc., in the following:

ing; te'e'usa, he is running; teho'kaki, he barked; tecotAemi, he brushes hair.

    This is regularly formed by the postposition of la'ki, which is
composed of la, not, and a suffix of unknown force which also appears
with kaki, cannot. la'ki has the same effect upon the preceding verb-
stem as the subordinating suffixes -tsel, -kwen and frequently causes
them to lose the vowel of their tense-aspect suffixes. This fact, taken
together with other indications, suggests that -ki is the general verbal-
izer.

with the meaning of ""without."" For examples cf. §93.",[148]

                     §95. Formation of Noun-Stem
    There are three types of stems found among nouns, a true nominal,
a neutral (identical with verb), and a nominalized verbal. The first
includes human beings, body-parts, natural phenomena, numerous
animal names, and a large number of manufactured articles; the second
miscellaneous objects; and the third manufactured objects and some
animal names.
    The true noun-stem appears in two forms, without noun formatives
and etymological prefixes and suffixes, and with them. They are either
simple (composed of only one stem), or composite in origin. The
composite forms may consist of two or more nouns, of a noun and a
verb, and of a noun and an adjective. The neutral stem differs from a
verb-stem in having some internal vowel change or is identical with it.
The nominalized verb-stem consists either of a verb simply nominalized
or of some verbal descriptive phrase nominalized.
    Primitive noun-stems.-They are unanalyzable, may be mono-
syllabic or polysyllabic, and end in a vowel or a consonant. With
regard to those that end in a vowel which is displaced by subjective -i,
it is likely that this terminal vowel is in origin a noun-formative and
not part of the stem.

posita, but the meaning of their individual constituents is unknown, e.g.:

                                 §96. Introduction
    Wappo possesses a large number of syntactical case forms all formed
in the same way, by suffixes. The principal ones are the subjective,
possessive, instrumental, ablative, locative, and a very specialized
vocative. The objective is the stem itself. This latter fact is rather
interesting because in Yuki proper, the suffix, which is the equivalent
of the Wappo subjective, is employed as the objective and the stem is
the subjective. This difference in usage is very interesting and suggests
a secondary development in both dialects.. Wappo throws no light on
the subject but Yuki proper does. There we find an -a as animate of
numerals and adjectives and an -i as inanimate of numerals. The
Wappo subjective is -i, the Yuki proper objective -a. In addition a
large number of Wappo nouns-a larger percentage than can be assumed
on the basis of chance-end in -a. But even more significant, the
normal method of forming the subjective of nominal stems ending in
a vowel, is not to add -i but to have it displace the terminal vowel,
thus suggesting that this -a is not part of the stem.
    Now if we look among the adjacent languages we find that a suffixed
vowel is characteristic of the objective in Yokuts, Miwok, Costanoan,
and Northern Maidu. In Yokuts where we have the fullest data it is
-a, -o, and -i. The examples given of -i show that it is used only with
animal names and a few relationship terms.4' A large percentage of
nouns likewise show change of stem for the objective. A glance at
Kroeber's list42 demonstrates that the overwhelming number with a
suffix are names of. animals, body parts, and relationship terms. We
thus have two series, one prevailingly animate, the other inanimate.
    In the Hokan group, a true subjective case occurs in Achomawi
and Southwestern Pomo, and probably Pomo in general. In the
former language it has two forms, -ka for masculine and animals and
-waka for all others.43 In Southwestern Pomo it is -ya, to be identified
with Wappo -i, and is prevailingly used with animate' nouns. In
Northern Yana4 no subjective or objective case exists but there is a
differentiation for male and female in the demonstratives and the'
substantial derivatives of verbs, the male form having a vowel and
the female either no vowel or a vestigial one.

1929]              Badin: A Grammindr of the' Wappo Language                          131    The foregoing facts may have a bearing on the Wappo and Yukian
subjective case. In the first case Yuki -a, as Kroeber has suggested,45
is to be equated with Yuki -a animate numeral suffix, thus intimating
that its subjective case significance is secondary. Wappo nouns, we
have seen, have only -i subjective with no hint of division of nouns
into ei-ther animate and inanimate or male and female, unless the -a
of many noun-stems is to be interpreted as a vestige of some such
grouping. Now this -i of Wappo can, I believe, be equated with Yuki
-a objective and animate and its subjective force be regarded as sec-
ondary. We can consequently assume for generalized .Yukian a noun-
grouping into animate and inanimate and this in turn may be regarded
as merely a special aspect of masculine and non-masculine and would
be easily comparable to Hokan male-female and Yokuts male-female-
body-part nouns contrasted with other nouns.
    Summing up, therefore, we sug'gest that the Wappo subjective case
is a secondary and late development of an older generalized Yukian
animate-inanimate gender system and that that in turn is related to
a Hokan male-female and a Californian Penutian(?) male-female
differentiation.
    Only a few words are necessary for the other cases. Tie instru-
mental, ablative, and locative are identical with the same elements in
Yuki and have correspondences in Hokan (Pomo, Achomawi, Salinan,
Yana?) and in Californian Penutian (Wintun, Maidu, Yokuts). The
possessive case -me is the Wappo general possessive pronoun, which is
however always prefixed to nouns. The vocative -sta is a special local.
Wappo development with a very restricted meaning.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140]"
"                §70. Formation of the Imperative Singular
    It is exceedingly doubtful whether there are any true imperative
prefixes and suffixes, the prefixes found, ma-, ho-, te-, being pronominal
objects, and the suffixes -ti, -ma, -la, -te, etc., either only secondarily
connected with the imperative as -ti, or stems with aspect increments.
The vowel ending -e' found with so many imperatives is either the
original stem-vowel or a reduced form of it. Be this as it may the
Wappo today definitely associates an imperative forge with all these
elements.
    Imperative prefixes ma-, ho-, tE-.-These have all been amply dis-
cussed before. te- is the most frequently employed. ma- is possibly
of a double origin, from ma- objective indefinite pronoun and from
ma""a a conjunction meaning ""would that!""
    Imperatives in absolute stem.-In a large number of cases the im-
perative is simply the stem. As we mentioned before there apparently
was a vowel suffix (?) -a connected with the imperative in Yuki proper,
and Wappo -a may be a survival of it. The whole subject has, however,
become obscured in Wappo by the fact that almost all stems end in a
vowel. When the imperative ends in a vowel it is followed by a marked
glottal catch much stronger than that accompanying most terminal
vowels and generally carries, likewise, a secondary stress accent. Im-
peratives in -e are generally associated with indefinites in -i, -a.
     a'sTi', give!; i'k'e', pewk!; o't-i', suck!; o-e'le', dig out!; o'ye', move! (indefinite
oi-, future oyel); ole'te', notch!; oli'tse', fill up! (indefinite lits-, future litsata);
otc-u'la' lie! (indefinite tcul-, future tcu'le); ots'a'e', try!; u'k-i, drink!; ci'la',
pass out of sight!; ci'u', whistle!; ho'l-a, stand!; hLntco'hel, dream!; hocu'pepel,
turn from side to side!; hoka'lel, keep!; homu'yel, think!
    As the absolute stem only occurs with the imperative (certain par-
ticipial forms excepted), this can be considered just as definitely a
method of forming this mode as if prefixes, suffixes, or stem modification
of any kind had been employed. It might, in fact, be contended that
imperatives of this type are formed by vowel contrast, the indefinite
-i being set off against the imperative -e, -a against -i, loss of vowel
against -a, etc.

the future suffix -si the imperative has fallen together with the future:
     hutsila""ci', be blind!, future hutsila""ci (from hutsila""ci-si); maht-'nasi', go
across!, future ht'nasi (from ht'nas-si); na'oasi', show!, future na'oasi (from
na'oas-si); nalE""eci', be angry!, future nale""eci (from nale""ec-si); ohoi'tesi', begin!,
future ohoi'tesi (from ohoites-si); homa'sasi', miss!, future oma'sasi (from oma'-
sas-si); homata'wlsi', pretend!, future homata'wtsi (from homata'wts-si).
    Imperatives in -ti.--ti, we have seen, is probably participial in origin
and is not infrequently used as such in the texts. Its imperative force
is, however, quite definite now and is more specifically associated with
indefinites in -mi. Phonetically it exercises a definite influence upon
the preceding vowel, either reducing it to -L or causing it to disappear
entirely, thus following the analogy of the indefinite and past in -ta.
If the terminal stem-vowel has been retained more frequently than is
the case for indefinites in -mi, -sv, cv and pasts in -ta, this is probably
due to the influence of the imperatives in -e, -i, -a and the analogy of
the future.

                             §45. Introduction
    The Wappo verb presents an unusual amount of difficulty. Often
it is quite impossible to determine where the stem ends and where
formatives and affixes begin, and frequently enough when the stem is
clearly differentiated, its exact form remains uncertain by reason of
consonant and vowel changes to which it is subjected. We have conse-
quently a double task, first the precise determination, as far as that is
possible, of the verb-stem, and secondly, an orderly presentation of the
various irregularities that have arisen.
    After all functional and petrified suffixes and prefixes have been
accounted for, the verb-stem appears in a form that is assuredly not
original and yet defies further analysis. Stems of the type c+v+c
approximate perhaps most closely to their original form, although here
too an old terminal vowel may have been lost. The normal stems
(c+v+c+v, v+c+v) have terminal vowels that are, in many cases,
secondary. However the primary task is to decide which of the primary
verb bases reflects the original quality of this vowel most accurately.
On the whole it is best preserved in those futures that have not reduced
all terminal vowels to secondary -v-. It is also found in the indefinite,
past, and imperative. Yet it seems doubtful whether, all in all, one
can be reasonably certain of more than thirty per cent of the cases.
The nature of the terminal vowel must therefore be left undetermined.
Similarly in monosyllabic stems of the form c+v and c+v+c, where
in obviously related verbs the vowel and occasionally the initial conso-
nant varies, the true nature of the stem must also be left undetermined
except that we may feel certain that the glottalized consonant and -i-
and -u- are likely to be non-original. Pedantic as it may seem, if we
wish to have regard for their historically older forms, all we have a
right to predicate is the following: base with variable consonant+vari-
able vowel, c+variable vowel+c, c+v+c+ variable vowel. Probably
when we know more about the other Yukian dialects and the other
American Indian languages, particularly Penutian and Hokan, this
 may be remedied.
1929]           Badin:. A Grammar of the Wappo La#guage                61    Whatever may have been their original form, today the verb-stems
appear normally with a detachable prefix and one or more detachable
suffixes. Furthermore the terminal vowel of the c+v+c+v type is
often felt as a formative charged with aspect, modal, and voice sig-
nificance. Deprived of its prefixes, formatives, and suffixes, the base
contains frequently no very concrete meaning, although essentially
predicating in connotation.
    For various reasons discussed repeatedly, of a phonetic and morpho-
logical nature, the bases of the various tenses differ materially from
each other and this has necessitated an artificial grouping of verbs
into what we have called stem-formations. In addition we find the
indefinite tense-aspect formed in a number of different ways, some of
which are more or less definitely associated with certain types of future,
past, and imperative. For the sake of bringing clarity here, even
though it is fictitious, a grouping into classes has been devised based
on the method of forming the indefinite.
    Our treatment of the verb then will consist of the following sections:
    1. Verb bases.
    2. Tense-aspect roots (briefly tabulating the variability of the roots
of some verbs).
    3. Types of stem-formation.
    4. Classes.
    5. Formation of tenses, modes, voices, and aspects.
    6. Absolute forms (participle, infinitive).","[69, 70]"

    A fairly large number of suffixes, for the most part no longer or
only sporadically functional, are found fused with verb-stems. In many
cases their meaning can no longer be determined with any exactness,
if at all. That we are dealing with true suffixes and not secondarily
interpreted terminal consonants, the examples clearly testify. Some
of them correspond to suffixes still functional in Yuki.
    1. -p, meaning not clear.
     naka-p-el, to bite; naka""e, to bite.
     hotca-p, to crack; hotsa""e, to split, crack.

   ota""-k, to hit; ota'ts, to hit.
   opo'-k-el, to wrap body; po'wE-l, to wrap.

   ma-k, to go by; mi, to go.
   tc-ata'-k, to cut off bark; ta'pe, to cut.
    3. -m, meaning not clear. Two suffixes are possibly involved here,
both found in Yuki, -ma motion towards, and -m involuntary, inanimate
actions, and automatic motions or sounds.
    tv-m, to hit with knuckles; t-'ao, hit, bruise and tats, hit with hand.
    ta-m, to swim; hoto'yala, wade in water.

    no-m, to travel; ma'-ni-, to go by boat.
    nota'-m, to lie on stomach; te', to be stretched.
   4. -n, meaning not clear. It is apparently identical with Yuki -n
whose force is also not clear.
    tcunutc'Y'-n-e, to sharpen; namv'-tst, to sharpen.

    to'-tci, to arrange; omato'-, to fix hair.
    opt'-tct-ki, to burst; pa""e, .to burst.
    6. -ts8v meaning unknown.

    ta'-ts-e, to hit; tt'ao, to hit.
    ht'-ts-i, to pound acorns; he'yi, to grind.
    22 Kroeber says, ""-k is somewhat indefinite in force. It appears to be used
with intransitive verbs to indicate an action, as contrasted with a state, of the
conception implied by the verb stem."" (This series, 9:359.)
    28 This may however be ho-to-ka-la, around-water-discontinuous-action-semi-
passive. It is just conceivable that -k is really -ka-, suffix denoting discontinuous
activity.
    24 There are two suffixes here, -ha- and -m.

    9. -ya, meaning uncertain, possibly to be, to inake. Like -wa and
-ha, this suffix is possibly the causative -a preceded by an old -i of the
verb-stem. It has been occasionally confused with -ya- to go and
vice versa.

     me-i'-ya-ya, he sweats; me-'i, water.

variant of -a. There are possibly two distinct suffixes involved.
     ku'-he, he runs.
     nak*e'hi-se, he slides down.

"                       §13. Predicating Concepts
    Wappo, and Yukian in general, is built up around the verb. In form
it is both monosyllabic and polysyllabic. The monosyllabic stem
appears as v+c (rare), c+v, and c+v+c. The last two are fairly
common. The polysyllabic stem is either v+c+v+c (rare) or c+v
+c+v and c+v+c+v+c. The second is probably the prevailing type
in the language, the c+v+c+v+c type although not rare being clearly
secondary in origin.
    The stem consists essentially of two elements, the base and a
formative suffix. Many verbs, however, also appear with a prefix
1929]              Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                            19forming so integral a part of it that it seems best to think of two stems,
:(a) base+formative element and (b) prefix+base+formative element.
As seen today the base or root is rather colorless, the formative element
fixing it, so to speak, in aspect, voice, mode, and time and the suffixes
and prefixes elucidating it more definitely in direction and position.
The grammatical and semantic discussions that follow will, however,
make it fairly evident that this colorlessness of the base is not original
and that it had a much more concrete significance at one time. In
this earlier stage the base, which probably had no formative elements
in the sense in which they exist today, expressed shape, number of
subject and object, and aspect. It has preserved the first in a fair
number of verbs, the second vestigially, and has transferred the func-
tion of the last to a large number of prefixes and suffixes.
     Today the typical stem consists of a prefix implying indefinite
 subject or object; the base; the formative, and a suffix indicating some
kind of aspect. Almost as frequent, however, is the type consisting of
pronominal prefix indicating the relation of the subject of the verb to
that of the preceding sentence, plus adverbial or instrumental prefix,
plus stem, etc.
     At no time apparently, now or previously, have suffixes been used
to indicate shape and position in the manner of Siouan. Plurality and
distribution, however, were and still are so indicated.
     The lack of concrete significance of the base, a trait that must,
in spite of its probable secondary origin, be regarded as extremely
old, has resulted in converting the verb into a kind of neutral stem.
It even may be claimed that the verb-stem is formed by the addition
of certain verb-formatives to a neutral base, even if historically we
shall have to admit that the neutral stem merely represents a degen-
erate verb-base. Only such an interpretation can explain why today
everything can be verbalized: adjective, noun, adverb, etc. It is
likewise probably only this colorlessness that has enabled the verb-stem
to fall so easily a prey to the general process of nominalization to which
it is now being subjected. That neutral stems once existed however
it would be unnecessarily pedantic to deny. There are, in fact, a number
of nouns and verbs where it is well-nigh impossible to tell whether the
predicating or denominating concept is more original:
   pe, foot; poi, kick; pe-k, to track; -tv-, water and all activities of water; o'kEl,
word; oka'li, talk; hucb'lak, hole, omo-ci'li, make holes.
    Are these verbalized nouns or nominalized verbs? poi can conceiv-
ably be translated as intensively-footing-it and pek, footing-it; but
oka'li, wording-it and omoci'li, holding-it is not very likely, and if
20      University of California Publications in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27o'kEl comes from oka'li why not pe, foot from pv? Still neither is neces-
sary. On the whole, however, not much is really gained by the hypo-
thesis of originally neutral stems.
    Both the available evidence and normal presumption seem to favor
some such view as that hinted at before, namely a rising and falling
in the concrete content of stems, neutral stem succeeding verb stem
and verb stem neutral stem.","[27, 28, 29]"

tered, e.g.:
   ati'aca, I am thirsty; omoti'ase, it overflows; wee'aki, they are dead, etc.
In the first two cases, -a- is a causative suffix, in the last, probably a
plural.
    Another group of secondary diphthongs is formed by the syncope
of -wv to -u and -yv to i.
    A third type is formed by vowel expansion, -e- becoming -ai- before
the suffix -yv:
   hokaka'iya, he is crawling (*kaka); okala'iyele, he is crawling (*okale).
    It was probably the realization of the many diphthongs in Yuki
proper, obviously of secondary origin, that induced Kroeber9 to deny
their actual existence for Yuki proper altogether and by implication
for Wappo. That they are original in Wappo is abundantly attested
by the vocabulary and by the alternation of vowel and diphthong to
express different verbal aspects.
    The apparent absence of diphthongs in Yuki proper is due to the
fact that they have there probably all developed into )uble vowels.
At least the doubling can so be interpreted. On suci. i hypothesis

12         University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.         [Vol. 27this doubling would seem to be analogous to the use of diphthong-
ization for mode-aspect in Wappo. The following examples are taken
from Kroeber's sketch:10
     anp kotpa, I shall go; anp kootik, I go
     tc'u'lamek, begins to sprout; tc' uu'tik, is sprouting
     tisilwi, jumped; tiika, jump!
     kom, came; kootmil, came
     ha, hold; haatil, hold!
     tuakmil, he put in; t'uuknamlikiik, put-where-was
     cu'a, sit!; kacu'uhuk, I sit here                                 §6. Accent
    Accent, exclusively that of stress, is very strong and associated with
a definite syllable in each word. In disyllabic words it is always on the
first syllable and. in polysyllabic words it is practically always on the
antepenult. It can be stated, as a general rule, that the vowel accented
is the stem vowel and that it rarely shifts no matter how many suffixes
are added.
     at'a'tasa, he leaches acorns, at'a'tattsta, he leached acorns; omiso'm-ci, it
becomes evening (som, stem); oko'heleksi, he is constipated (kohe, stem); omoti'se,
it overflows.(ti, stem).
     In a few futures, however, the accent is shifted:
    ometo'ttsi, he touches, o'metate'si, he will touch; ote'lmi, it is flat, otele'si, it
will be- flat; homepu'tesi, he stirs up, ho'mepute'si, he will stir up.
    Occasionally, under unknown conditions, it is not the true stem
-vowel but the last vowel of the stem that is accented.
    okela'ci, he will be lonesome (okelv, stem): okalai'yele, he is crawling (oka'le,
stem); hokakai'ya, he is crawling (ka'ka, stem).
   The influence of accent has been very marked in certain forms of
the verb particularly in the indefinite, where it frequently seems to
have caused the elision of a vowel.
    ci'u-mi, he whistles (for ciwe'-mi); ct'tsce, it is wet (for cl'tse-ce); u'k-ce, he
drinks (for uki-ce).
   When the elided vowel is preceded by h, w, or y, these sounds
become respectively ', u, or i.
   oye""-mi, he sets a trap (for oye'he-mi); hope""-se, he looks around (for hope'
 he-se): ci'u-mi, he whistles (for ci'we-mi); maki'u-mi, he stretches (for maki'wL-mi);
 homu'i-ce, he thinks (for homu'ye); hote'i-ce, he hovers (for hote'ye).

1929]           Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                  13   Why accent should have presumably had this marked influence in
the indefinite and not in the future it is difficult to explain. It seems
best to assume either a difference in kind of accent, or possibly the
operation of additional non-accentual factors in the first case.","[20, 21, 22]"

        §67. Influence of Indefinite Suffixes on Terminal Stem-Vowel
   All the preceding suffixes appear with preserved, reduced, and
apocopated terminal stem-vowel, as the following examples show:
   la. -mi with preserved terminal stem-vowel.
    ('name, he is afraid; o-i'semi, he digs for water; oka'ttmi, he hitches up;
ota'ntmi, he holds on coal; otsa""emi, he tries; oya'omi, he names; hoyu'emi, he
takes all; hots'a'emi, he kills; howa'emi, he divides.
    lb. -mi with mutated terminal stem-vowel.
    ocu'tumi, he extinguishes (fire) (ocu'tt); ohi'pumi, he saves (ohu'pi); ohi'tsumi,
he pounds acorn (ohi'tse); ola'tomi, he hits (ola'ti); omo'tomi, he arranges hair
(omalti); opa'tcomi, he ties (opA'tcL); ota'k'umi, he hits round object (otaLk'&);

hoka'nice, he runs on four legs; hosi""wese, they run away; ko'lci, it flows down;
ku""laca, it smelts; mahu""ece, he goes out doors; mahe""tase, he carries.
      2b. -sv and -cv with mutated terminal vowel.
    oha'wese, he bets (ohawa); omv'kise, it lies (omvka); u""k&tise, he is drunk
(u""kdta); utsi'tcise, it gets dark (utsi'tca); he'wuse, it grows (he'wa); huye'kese,

(homu'ye); honatsa'se, he yawns (honatsa'e); hope""se, he watches over (hope'he);
hote""ce, it melts (hotehe); hoso""se, he is tired (hosm'a).
    3. Indefinites in -ya, -(i)ya, -(ai)ya.
    It has been impossible to formulate any rules which would explain
when these various suffixes are used. All that can be said about them
is that -ya has a definite influence on the terminal stem vowel, -v-
changing it to -a- or -ai- and -a, -o, -u vowels change to -i. -a- is un-
common.
    a. Indefinites in -ya.
    ha'waya, he rests (ha'we); htnwe'ya, they slept (hlnwe'-without vowel
change); teyo'keya,. he flew (ya'ke); meiya'ya, he sweats (mei'ye); tsatsa'ya, it
gets cold (tsa'tsa).
      b. Indefinites in -iya.
    metco'hiya, he is going away (metco'ho); uka'hiya, (I) suppose (uka'ha?);
ho-e'wiya, he is afraid (hoe'wu); hole'iya, he runs (hole'u); mahe'tiya, he picks
up (mahe'ta); male'piya, he gets up (male'pu).
      c. Indefinites in -aiya.
    hoka'kaiya, he crawls (hoka'ke); no'maiya, they go to bed (naVme); hucuhai'ya,
it steams (hucu'he); mepulai'ya, it is full (mepu'le); mewe'laiya, he bumps
(mewe'le).
                      §68. Formation of the Future
    There are two futures in Wappo, a simple and a periphrastic,
respectively -si and -yaomi. Every verb in the lan'guage can prac-
tically use both forms although a few occur with -yaomi only. This
latter is clearly composed of three elements -ya- (old verb ""to go""),
-o- probably an old formative possibly related to petrified suffix -wv
(cf. §35), and -mi indefinite tense. It is, in other words, the indefinite
form of *ya, to go, and means he-is-to-go. Both -si and -yaomi are
unknown to Yuki proper, the futures in that language being- -pa and.
1929]               Badin: A G-rammar of the Wappo Language                           101-mik, of which the latter is identical with Wappo -mak-. The -am,
-yam continuative and habitual usitative of Yuki is not related to
Wappo -yaomi but to -mi, -ma progressive.
    In addition to -si there are a large number of increment forms
based on -si (-tesi, -dlsi, -maksi, -leksi, -ksi, -stesi) and a few based on
-yaomi (-kyaomi, -lekyaomi). For examples of these cf. §46.
    The main characteristic of the future stem is that in contradistinc-
tion to the indefinite and many pasts in -ta, it generally preserves the
terminal vowel of the stem. At times, however, this vowel is reduced
to -e and occasi6nally assimilated to -a. It is completely lost only in
-te- increment futures.
    1. Futures with preserved terminal vowel.-
    as-i'si, he will give (indefinite, a'sa; past, a's-ta); amima'kasi, it will rain
(indefinite, amima'kei); o't-asi, he will drown (indefinite, O'tise); oe'lesi, he will
dig out (indefinite, oe'li; past, oe'lta); oci'pesi, he will sew (indefinite, oci'pi;
past, oci'pta); oha'hesi, he will fan (indefinite, oha'mi; imperative, oha""ti):
oha'wasi, he will bet (indefinite, oha'wese); ole'wesi, he will tie up (indefinite,
ole'umi); oli""tsatasi, he will fill up (indefinite, oli'tsmi); omoti'ase, it will overflow
(indefinite, omoti'se).
    2. Futures with reduced terminal stem vowel -e-.-These are prac-
tically all increment futures -lsi, -ksi, etc.
     ene'stesi, he will be afraid (e'na); oka'stmeksi, he will put around neck (oka'so);
ona'napelsi, he will graze (na'napi); ci'leksi, he will pass out of sight (ci'la);
ha'telsi, he will know (ha'ta?); htnpika'lestesi, he will be sleepy (hLnpi'kali);
hacu'pepelsi, he will turn from side to side (cu'pepi); ho'lAeksi, he will stand (ha'la);
hoka'telsi, he will carry round object (hoka'tala); hoki'telsi, hoki'tesi, he will
turn around (hoki'ti, hoki'tu); hope'heleksi, he will look around (pe'hela); ikapa'-
telsi, he will bother (ikapa'tu).
    S. Futures with assimilated terminal stem vowel -a-, -u-.
    amisa'muci, it will become evening (sa'mi); ota'hasi, he will shoot (tahhe);
otca'hasi, he will fall down (tca'he): mai'hot-a'nusi, he will warm himself (hot-a'ne);
mohule'kusi, he will peep (mole'ke).
    4. Futures with lost terminal stem vowel.-
    E'ltesi, he will dig a hole (e'Ji); oka'ltesi, he will talk (oka'li?); oka'stesi, he
will wear beads (oka'so); hoka'n-tesi, he will run on four legs (hoka'ni); k'i'ntesi,
he will open (k'i'ne); mahi'ntesi, he will get up (mahi'ni?); make'ktesi, he will
throw (make'ke); mala'mtesi, he will carry in hand (mala'ma); ma'mtesi, he will
gamble (ma'me); ma'ntesi, he will hold flat object (ma'ni).
   6. Futures with inorganic -v-.-These are all stems ending in a
consonant.
    metce'nesi, he will catch etc. (tcen); metcu'lesi, he will take off (tcul); ola'lesi,
he will dance (lal); onL'cesi, he will turn in water (nwc); opL'1lsi, he will fill (pdl);
opa'nesi, he will close (pan); ota'pLsi, he will stab (tap); otele'si, he will make
flat (tel); owt'cLsi, he will put acorns in (wLc); CL'Ctsi, he will clear nose (ccc).
102       University of California Publicoations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.        [Vol. 27   6. Futures in -ci.-These are all due to assimilation of terminal -c
with -si.
    amico'iyaci, it will be hot; amiso'muci, it will become evening; amik*e'uci, it
will become daylight; ama-u'tcuwa'ci, it will become dark; ocika'lice, he will be
stingy; okela'ci, he will be lonesome; okel a'ci, he will be dumb; ok'o""ci, it will
boil; o'manots'e'wuce, he will be afraid; uta'tci, he will be deaf.

     ots&pya'omi, he will paint red; cattya'omi, it will be bitter; co-iya'omi, it will
be burnt; he'lLcya'omi, it will steam; hoto'yelya'omi, he will wade in water;
howa'lelya'omi, he will crawl; hucu'heya'omi, it will steam; hule'ekya'omi, it

"                             §7. Pitch Accent
    The evidence for the existence of pitch accent is so vague and
contradictory that it carries no real conviction. As it is just possible
however that Wappo did at one time possess it, the following notes
may be of value.
    A weak falling tone seems to characterize the future and the im-
perative. Whether this is a true pitch accent could not be determined.
In any case, the accent of the future and imperative is not as marked
as is that of the indefinite. The hypothesis of a former pitch accent
would account for the preservation of the original vowel in the future
and imperative and it is known to occur in certain Hokan languages
(Achomawi and probably Southwestern Pomo) and to possess just this
function.
                     §§8-11. PHONETIC PROCESSES
                           §8. Vocalic Processes
    There are five marked phonetic tendencies illustrated in the vowel
treatment of Wappo: (1) general vocalic mutation, (2) change of e
(occasionally ai) to a, (3) vocalic consonance, (4) vocalic syncope, and
(5) syllabic syncope.
    1. The very extensive vocalic mutation, while unquestionably
phonetic in origin, has become so definitely and inextricably associated
with morphological processes that we have discussed it in connection
with the latter (§27 ff.).
    2. The change of e to a is due to two causes: reappearance of an
older reduced a before the suffix -yv or -i, and assimilation with an a of
following or preceding syllable. This latter we shall discuss under vocalic
consonance.
    All terminal vowels have a tendency to become reduced to -e. In
the case of old formatives and many suffixes the marked morphological
significance of the vowels has tended to check this tendency. This
was not true, however, for the terminal vowel of disyllabic stems.
These have fairly regularly been reduced to -e. The fact that this older
-a should nevertheless be able to reassert itself so frequently upon the
addition of a syllable suggests that this reduction is recent and has
14        University of CaZiforniaPublications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.        [Vol.227been due to some change in accentual conditions. Personally I am
inclined to believe that such a change has taken place and that it was
nothing more nor less than the loss of an older pitch accent. A few
examples follow
     tsa'tsa-ya, it is cold (tsa'tseki, it is getting cold); mesano'mayok, where they
slept (no'meki, future); hoka'kaiya, he crawls (hoka'kesi, future); taka'tsta, it
blistered (ta'keki, past); mewe'laiya, he bumps (mewe'lesi, future); po'layi, boy
 (subjective); pa'le (objective); me'tayi, woman (subjective); me'te (objective);
so'kayi, star (subjective); so'ke (objective); ci'ayi, grass (subjective); ci'e (ob-
jective), napu'tsayi, bird's beak (subjective); napu'tse (objective).
    3. Vocalic consonance in Wappo is possibly only secondary in
origin, i.e., it is not an old general Yukian trait. Were it not for the
fact that a member of instances of E, i, and a consonance were found,
the overwhelming preponderance of the vowel consonance would justify
us in regarding the whole matter simply as an assimilation of a weak
generally terminal e to a.
    Assimilation seems to take place either with the following or with
the preceding vowel:
    a's-a, he gives (stem, asi): hoto'yala, he wades (hotoyel); howa'lala, he crawls
(howa'lel): ene'stesi, he will be afraid (e'na); li'pele, he killed many (li'pu);
ma-a'piki, he carried up (ma-a'po); u'tuca, he is deaf (u'ta); oka'ntaka, with rela-
tives (oka'nteka); hosa'hono'mi, what I cover myself with (hosa'henomi); atetco'
palasa, I'm making him warm (tco'pel); atetco'alasa, I'm making him sick (tco'El);
onut'hala, he's hidden it away (nu'he); a'noma, for them (a'nima); mo'nomi, he hides
(mo'na).
   At times this vocalic consonance seems to operate only when
another syllable is added, and since in all the cases obtained it is always
the vowel a that is involved, it is perhaps best to regard these as an-
alogous to the cases where a reappears when the suffix -i or -yv is added.
    uya'tcasi, he carries (uya'tcE); kakima'kasi, it hails (kakimalke); ka't'ace,
he laughs (ka't'i); ima-a'pasi, he will carry up (ma-a'po).
    4. Vocalic apocope is no longer a purely phonetic process today,
whatever it may have been in origin. Insofar as it can be described
phonetically, however, it falls under the following rules:11
    a. A vowel preceded by -h-, -n-, -m-, -1-, -s-, -c-, -p- (?) and fol-
lowed by indefinite -mi, past -ta, and imperative -ti disappears (mono-
syllabic vowel or diphthong stems excepted).
     oha""mi, he fans (stem, oha'he); ohi'lmi, he builds (ohi'le); olo'lmi, he dances
(olb'le); ont'cmi, he turns in water (ont'ce); opo'nmi, he closes (opo'ne); ku'pmi,
he soaks (ku'p&); me-e'nta, he scolded (mE-e'ni); metcenta, he caught (metce'ne);
pe'hti, put! (pene); powe'lti, cover! (powe'le); tetemate'nti, hand over! (te'ni).
    11 There are of course some exceptions, e.g., ma'nomi, he hides; e'name, he is
afraid.

followed by -mi, -ta, -ti.
    ocu'tumi, he extinguishes (fire); ohi'pumi, he saves for someone; ohi'tsumi,
he pounds acorn; oka'ttmi, he hitches up; ole'pumi, he places; omo'tomi, he fixes
hair; opa'tcomi, he ties; ota'kumi, he hits round object; otco'pomi, he makes warm;
hoki'tumi, he turns around; hots-a'ptmi, he breaks round object; huwa'tsumi, he
holds fingers crossed.'2
     c. The same two rules hold for vowels preceded by -n-, -m-, -1-,
-s-, -c-, -k- when followed by the indefinite suffixes -cv and -sv- and by
affixes beginning with t- (-ta, past; -te- increment, etc.).
     (1) With lost vowel:
    em-se, he gets lost (e'me or e'mu); e'ltesi, he will dig a hole (e'li); e'lta, he kept
hold of (e'lu); amiso'mci, it becomes evening (so'mi); amima'kci, it rains (ma'ka);
u'kce, he drinks (u'ki); hometc'o'lsi, he knocks (tc'o'le); hote""ce, it melts (te'hi);
hoto'kse, he floats (hoto'ka); howa'cta, he broke (howa'ce); huna""se, he carries
on shoulder (huna'ha); kakima'kce, it hails (kakima'ka); ka'm'ta, he cried
(ka'm'e); ma'o'ntesi, he will dig (ma-a'ne); maka'lse, he takes in (maka'la);
ma-k3'ltesi, he will roast (mako'li); ma'mtesi, he will gamble (ma'me).
    (2) With retained vowel:
     ometo'tesi, he touches; ohu'pLci, he dives in water; ona'napise, he grazes;
opt'tcLsi, he breaks; otst'ptci, he paints red; ha'kuce, he is hungry; htnka'tece, he
snores; homepu'tesi, he stirs up; honats'a'se, he yawns; hukt'tise, he is dizzy;
hutsa'tise, he gets well; ko'tctsi, he tickles; ka't'ace, he laughs.13
    5. Syllabic apocope, i.e., reduction of yv and -wv to -i- and -u-
respectively, is, like simple vocalic apocope, as much a morphological
as a phonetic trait today. We must regard what, at first impression,
resembles diphthong simplification (ac > a, ic > i, ia > i, oa > a) as merely
a variety of this syllabic apocope. It seems best t)o regard most of
these as broken down -aye- -iye-, -oya-:
     o'ise, he moves gently (a'iye); ohe'i, he sharpens (he'ye); ole'umi, he ties up
(le'wt); omoti'se, it overflows (moti'a); ow&'esi, he rubs (wa'ye); ci'umi, he whistles
(ci'we); hi'umi, he shakes from side to side (hi'we); hali'mi, he drives animals
(hali'e); homele'usi, he swings (homele'we); homu'ice, he thinks (homu'yel);
honats'a'se, he yawns (honats'a'e); honi'se, he rides in boat (honi'el); hoso""se,
he is tired (hoso'a); hote'ice, he hovers (hote'yel); hot'i'mi, he straightens (hot'i'e);
hotca'mi, he splits (hotca'e); hots'a'mi, he measures (hots'a'e); huci'se, he likes
(huci'a): maki'umi, he stretches (maki'wt); mali'usi, he comes and helps (mali'wa);
mamu'ise, it disappears (mu'ye); mat-3'ise, he goes in water (mat.otya).
    12   There are a few exceptions: oli'tsmi, fills up; ots&'kmi, shoves.
    13   Exceptions are: ct'tsce, be wet; huka'nice, run on four legs; huka'lice, think.

             §9. Discussion of Vocalic and Syllabic Apocope
    Vocalic and syllabic apocope can be considered under two poss'ible
headings, either as due to certain morphological or to purely phonetic
causes. It could, for instance, be argued with some show of reason
that all the -yV- are variants of the old progressive suffix -ya- to go,
that -a and its variant -e is the old causative suffix, that -wv- is an old
petrified formative and that their simplification and apocope is due to
the clearly felt significance of such durative-indefinite suflikes as -sv,
-cv which demanded the durative vowel -i-, etc. That such purely
morphological considerations have exercised a discernible influence in
this connection is, I think, fairly clear, but their influence has, in
the main, been that of extending an already existing fact, namely,
a loss of terminal vowel, in the indefinite. We are thus thrown back,
as might have been expected, upon a phonetic causation. Here we
can make more progress if, instead of trying to explain why terminal
vowels were lost in the indefinite, past, and occasionally in the impera-
tive, we attempt, on the contrary, to account for their preservation
in the future, imperative, and, under certain conditions, in the indefinite
and past.
    One of the marked characteristics of all future forms is the tendency
for the development of a secondary accent on the -e- preceding the
future suffix. Indeed in many cases this -e- seems to bear the main
accent. It would, at any rate, be quite correct to state that this -e-
was quantitatively equal to the vowel bearing the main accent. This
is in marked contrast to the value of the same vowel in the indefinite
where it is generally quite vestigial and, as we have seen, often dis-
appears entirely. It cannot be due to the influence of the future suffix
-si because it is the phonetically identical durative suffix sv that is
associated with most of the clear instances of apocope in the indefinite.
Two hypotheses seem plausible, either that the -s- of the future is
in origin quite different from the -s- durative or that certain specific
accentual characteristics of the future tended to preserve this -e-. For
the first hypothesis no convincing evidence exists. It is just conceiv-
able, but not really plausible, that an original Wappo future ts- in
weakening to s- lengthened the vowel preceding it. The best explana-
tion is unquestionably to be sought in the second hypothesis. On this
 hypothesis the future suggests either a shifting of accent or, conceivably,
 a different type of accent entirely, namely pitch. For a shift of accent
 a number of well-authenticated examples exist and it seems, on the
 whole, to be at the base of the preservation of the vowel. What we
1929]              Radin:: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                          17should like to suggest is that originally all futures had a marked sec-
ondary accent on the terminal vowel of the stem, which has been
preserved today in only a few verbs.
    The preservation of the vowel in imperatives is accounted for
easily by the marked glottal catch so characteristic of it and which
acoustically always sounded much stronger than the glottal catch
accompanying practically all terminal vowels that are not aspirated.
    The preservation of terminal vowels after p-, t-, k-, tc-, ts- I cannot
adequately explain,14 any more than the marked tendency for all vowels
to be lost before -t. This applies even to futures.""5
    With regard to the loss of a vowel in the indefinite, this can be
explained by the strong stress accent on the stem vowel.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"                   §106. Adverbs and Adverbial Postpositions
   The adverbial stems are either simple without suffixes or composite
with suffixes. The first type may occupy any position in the sentence
but the second group is always placed after nouns and pronouns and
sometimes fuses with them to such a considerable extent as almost to
be regarded as suffixes. They precede verbs. It is exceedingly likely
that some of the nominal suffixes are really recently fused adverbs.
   Most of the adverbial stems are unrelated to the noun and verb,
but a few, derived from verbs, occur.
   1. Unsuffixed stems.
    e'nya, very; op', down; o'na, again; u""ku, already; cu""u, back; han, behind;
hu, yonder; ke'wi, tomorrow (k-e.'o, to dawn); ke'wu, early (k.e'o, to dawn);
le'wa, outside; me'na, fast; mo'ka, terribly; pa'-i, alone (pa'wa, one); te""iya,
slowly (-ya may be a suffix); te-'mo, above.
       2. Suffixed stems. (Those with hyphen are postpositions.)
      - o'npi, under (-pi, down ?); -o'npipi, under: 'o'pwela, under (-we'la, toward);
'opwe'lapi, down under (-we'la, toward; -pi, down ?); u'pe'ka, anywhere (u-, old
demonstrative ?; -peka, not clear); -u'wela, under (u-, in; -we'la); -ci'ka, on one
side (ci-, ?; -ka, meaning not clear), -cu'wela, below (cu""u, back; -we'la); -hanwe'la,
behind (han, behind; -we'la); hanwe'lepi, behind (han; -we'la; -pi); he'la, below

helawe'lapi, in front of (-we'la; -pi); he'o, there (he, this); he't-a, hither (he);
he'tati', right here (he); he'te', right here (he); -hi'nawela, other side (hi'na, other;
-we'la); -huci'-ka, to one side (hu-, yonder; -ci'-ka; hu- may be identical with u-
above); -huwe'lapi, sideways (hu-; -we'la; -pi); met-u-a'lapi, on top (met-, above;

"                          §78. Continuatives -l-, -le, -la39a
    Three distinctive uses of -1-, -le must be distinguished: as true
functional continuative, as fairly petrified increment in the future and
past of certain verbs, and as verbal plural suffix. To this must be added
its idiomatic fusion as a suffix of a not inconsiderable number of verbs,
a passive force (in -mele, -sele, -ccele, -kele) and lastly a participial-
absolute usage. The large number of stems in -1 indicates clearly that
fusion of the continuative with the verb-base is. of a very considerable
age. The existence of -1- increments in the future and past in Yuki
proper suggests that what might be regarded as the second ""petrifica-
tion"" of the continuative has likewise had considerable antiquity.
Apparently a third, fairly old, permanent fusion is to be seen in such
forms as:
      hoka'lela, to keep; howa'lala, to crawl; tewe'lelce, to come back.
   Thus we have the interesting phenomenon of a morphological suiffix
having possibly become petrified at three distinct periods in the history
of the language and still remaining functional, although it must be
confessed that today it is only weakly so. In addition to its present
vague continuative force it has, of course, also a plural function.
Indeed it is more frequently used today in this sense than in its con-
tinuative sense.
   Apart from its fusion with the verb-base -1, -le has at various times
entered into union with certain morphological elements. There are
      39 Cf. also §39.
1929]            Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                  115two types, one in which it precedes, e.g., -lek-, and one in which it
follows -cele, -sele -mle, -kele, -tele. In all these instances it is not its
continuative but its plural significance that seems to have survived.
That in the case of -cele, etc., it should have developed a passive meaning
is probably due to the influence of the unrelated semi-passive -la. The
participial force it not infrequently possesses in narration is apparently
merely a consequence of its appearing without a tense suffix, i.e.,
practically as an absolute form.
    How to explain the remarkable tenacity of this suffix is not simple.
The nominal collective plural -lu, -lo could have had no influence
because it has long ago become petrified itself and the noun-formative
-4 could only have had an influence in developing its absolute-participial
usage. However it must be pointed out that while it has survived as
a morphological element its meaning has become more and more vague
and elusive.
                                 §79. -ma, -ma
     -ma has a number of distinct uses, as progressive suffix, increment
in future and past of certain verbs (-mak-), semi-passive, imperative
singular, and participle-absolute. In addition, an old petrified suffix
 -m occurs that may be identical. In its usage it seems, therefore,
 somewhat parallel to continuative -4e. Whereas however all the different
 significance of -4e might be traced back to one and the same element
 (passive -la alone excepted), there is considerable reason to believe
 that for -ma a number of elements are involved. A comparison with
 Yuki proper shows that it seems to correspond to four distinct suffixes:
 -m involuntary, inanimate activities, -ma motion toward, -am continu-
 ative, habitual usitative, and -mik immediate future (?) or future
 intent (?). In Wappo itself there are a number of elements very similar
 phonetically: -mi-, to go, mak, to go, -me, indefinite tense, -me, suppli-
 cative imperative.
     The Wappo evidence shows clearly that -ma as progressive and
 -mak- increment belong together. This indicates that Yuki proper -am
 and -mik are related. Kroeber's suggestion that -mik implies future
 intent is quite correct but this is given by the -k cognate with Wappo
 -k- inferential. Yuki -am, -ma, I am inclined to think, are quite unre-
 lated-thus suggesting that srme of the uses of -ma in Wappo, where
 there is no particular progressive sense attached, indicate that they
 possibly go back to Yuki -ma, motion to. This is. perhaps particularly
 true of some of the -ma imperatives where there is no reason to believe
 that the -ma represents the -ma increment. -ma semi-passive I do not
 understand. -ma participial is the expanded absolute stem.
116        University of California Publications in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.      [Vol. 27            §80. Absolute Formations (Participle and Infinitive)
    Wappo has a number of absolute constructions either with the force
of absolute constructions or with the force of a participle or nominalized
verb. These are formally expressed in three ways: either by the bare
stem (original or expanded) without tense, modal or aspect suffixes;
by the stem with tense-aspect suffixes with lost terminal vowel; and
by special suffixes. The first method is apparently old for it is found
in Yuki proper. The second is, I suspect, also an old Yukian trait
but our Yukian evidence is too meager to demonstrate it. The third
method is probably a secondary development within Wappo, at least
-ti participial is.
    An infinitive exists that is merely an instrumentalized verb, i.e., the
verb-stem with prepositional suffix -ma, for. Instrumentalized verbs
are quite common although only four prepositions seem to be used:
-ma, for, -i, with, -noma, -nomi, with, and -ka, together with. For
further discussion cf. syntax §§117, 118 and for a possible relationship
of -ti and -i participial and -ti and -i, with, cf. §93.
    Participles, unexpanded and expanded absolute stem.
    ye'ka tcu'tita, he told him to go after (ye'ka); pu'ta, broken (pu't'a); hu'tsi
ko'k'e ts-ate""ewdlelke, eyes swollen they came home; mapu'li, running (pu'li);
mEwE'le, bumping (mewe'le); tcamet-o'yel, floating (met.o'yel); k-am, crying
(k-am); tek-u'we, running (k.u'we); ho'tco, walking (hatco"").
    Participles with lost tense-aspect vowel.-These are really nominal in
force and are perhaps nominalized stems. It is characteristic of sub-
ordinate clauses.
    ts'e'ilumi hilho'ltk, stop driving them; okA'lAk ts&une""hi, he took out the
buried; anu'ok tsa'mi ha'ttski, (you only) know how to steal; oka'luk tse'tta, he
stopped talking; ok-a'mak tse'tta, he stopped crying; otco'tk tse'Lta, he stopped
walking; u'kLc ona'oci, he saw him drinking; ts'e'svk hotsai'ase, he tried to swim;
at'o'pLs, boiling; k'&'tc a'ka""ta, I heard it boiling.
   Participles in -ti.-This is perhaps the oldest and most extensively
used of the participles. It does not seem to exist in Yuki. As indicated
in §70 it is now used as the imperative singular suffix but the many
examples in the text, where it has a participial force, show this to have
been the primary meaning.
    hi'ni ma""a we'talekti, (they) dropping to sleep; ma'uku'yukti, running after
him; ka't'ati, laughing, tep'e'nati, falling down? muk'e'ukti, falling dead; t'o'tati,
finishing; hok-u'wati, running; teni'ati, going; ca""iti, going out; wi""iti, hanging;
meyo'koti, flying up; p.a""ati, bursting.
    Participles in -i and -u.-i is simply the indefinite tense formative.
It is perhaps significant that today it is beginning to be felt as an abso-
lute form. -u is apparently the old proclitic for past tense put to a
1929]             Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                        117new use as indefinite vague past participle. As such it is regularly
suffixed. Both -i and -u can be legitimately regarded today as true
participial constructions. The former is being generalized as, for in-
stance, in such cases as tek-ane'li, packing, mai'hope'li, rolling oneself,
etc., and -u has lost practically all of its past significance. For examples
cf. §42.
    -1, -le, -mdce,-e, -sele with participial force.-In the texts all these
suffixes are frequently translated as participials due to the fact, as
pointed out above, that all forms without the tense-aspect suffixes
(-mi, -sT, -cr, -ki, -ta, -si) are today felt as absolute formations. The
continuative force of -1, etc., reinforces this tendency.
    For examples of -1 cf. §40. A few instances of the use of the others
follow:
     ye""mele, setting snares; holi'mele, driving (deer); ts'u'tele, skinning; mama'-
ncele, taking it home; mela""cele, driving them; tca'tcele, weaving baskets; ma'-
otcu'lusele, turning from side to side; wetca'sele, loving him.","[123, 124, 125, 126]"
"                §82. Plural by Stem-Differentiation
  Kroeber did not find it in Yuki proper,4 but it is quite clear in
Wappo although now, perhaps, on the point of being lost.
      ha'weke, they sit; yo""eke, he sits.
      ke'tki, they lie; mu'kvki, he lies.

    This is a very peculiar formation and seems to be connected with
the responsive (cf. §76). But as all the responsives seem to be responsive-
plurals it can be legitimately treated as plural as well. -e is not a suffix
but either the original or a mutated terminal stem vowel. It is clearly
contrasted with the singular where this vowel disappears. A few
examples involving the disappearance of other vowels also occur.
There is some evidence for a more general vowel mutation to express
plurality but it is still too doubtful to warrant acceptance.

      cutu'eki, they hang on; cutu'ki, he hangs on.

 tion of the terminal vowel -e, etc., is not connected with the expression

                    §§51-53. TYPES OF STEM-FORMATION
                §51. The Irregularity of the Wappo Verb
    The marked characteristic of the Wappo verb is, we have seen, its
irregularity. In most cases it is extremely difficult to determine the
exact verb-stem because of the numerous phonetic alterations that the
various tense-modal bases have undergone. The nature of these
changes is quite transparent. They are of a three-fold nature, loss of
original vowel or syllable, mutation of original vowel, and insertion
of an increment. The first two changes are confined mainly to the
indefinite and preterit and the last to the future-preterit stem. If to
the foregoing we add the influence of the tense-modal suffix upon the
preceding terminal vowel of the stem, the secondary shifting of accent
in some futures, and the mutation of the terminal vowel of stem for
morphological purposes, some indication of the intricacy of the verbal
system will be given. A few examples will perhaps make this clearer:
.70       University of California Publications in Am. Aroh. and Ethn.   [Vol. 27      a's-a is the indefinite of the stem, to give. The preterit is a's ta.
  One might therefore have assumed a stem as* or a's-a. The future and
 imperative however give us a's-i-si and a's*i'; a's*i unquestionably is
 the true stem.
      e'lice is the indefinite of the stem, to dig a hole, the future and
 past being e'l-tesi and e'l*teki. Here obviously e'li- of the indefinite is
 the stem. Our difficulties however begin as soon as we realize that -i
 is associated with the indefinite and the durative mode-aspect and that
 in another form of this verb o-e'li (to dig) we have a future in o-e'le-si
 and an imperative in o-e'le'. Now as a rule the form of the unincre-
 mented future-imperative is closer to the original verb-stem than the
 indefinite and we might perhaps postulate *ele as original or still better
 *el. However in a clearly related stem o-i'se-mi (dig for water), which
 can be analyzed into o- prefix, -i- verb stem, -s- durative suffix, -e either
 inorganic or reduced vowel of suffix, we have the stem appearing as *i.
 Now all these changes, puzzling as they are at first, become intelligible
 as soon as we realize that the stem vowel of a verb is not infrequently
 changed to express different kinds of aspects and modes. Our quest
 for the original stem has clearly proved futile.
     Let me give one more example: o't*i-se is the indefinite of the in-
transitive verb, to drown. The future and past are a't*a-si, o't-a-ki.
The stem ought to be *at-a, because we know that -se the indefinite-
durative suffix can cause the change of original -a to durative -i. How-
ever the transitive form is at*i-a'te-ki, -a being an old causative incre-
ment and -te- the frequentative increment. The stem itself is an old
root for water and appears in numerous forms (ta, ti, ta, tu). In our
particular case it is quite impossible to determine whether *ati or *ata
is the stem. The chances are that it is *ati because a number of futures
have taken the hortatory base characterized by the vowel -a- when the
indefinite ended in -i-se to prevent the confusion of the two forms;
secondly, only transitive-active verbs, in the main, use the -a base;
and lastly, the causative increment -a is an old formation of the lan-
guage and is likely to have preserved the older form of the stem.
     The way out of our difficulty would be to regard all terminal vowels
of disyllabic stems as true morphological elements. From one point
of view this is correct. Wappo today certainly gives the impression
of connecting terminal vowels with mode, voice, and aspect, and this
has probably led, as much as any other- cause, to a generalization of
-i for indefinite, -e for imperative, -u for passive. Historically, on the
other hand, we must postulate the disyllabic stem formation (c+v
+c+v) as representing a fairly old phase of the language.
1929]              1adin: A Grammar of the Wappo L4nguage                       71    To bring order into this maze of forms is not easy. Since the phonetic
variations of the stem are due as much, if not more, to morphological
considerations they should logically be treated together with the
formation of tense, mode, voice, aspect. But this would result in a
rather cumbrous and highly artificial arrangement. We have therefore
decided to discuss the whole problem here phonetically, and since it is
impossible to determine the verb-stem with any degree of exactness,
to make our groupings dependent upon the relation of the future-
preterit to the indefinite stem. In those cases where the preterit does
not coincide with the future, special mention will be made in the
respeStive sections.
    Only the principal types are given. Since the arrangement is con-
fessedly artificial and definitely circumscribed by our basis of com-
parison, some of the minor variations of the latter will not be given.
They will however be found in the preceding section on Verb Bases.
    In the table that follows, c = consonant, v = vowel, v =diphthong,
v' = accented vowel, v'= aspirated vowel, and v'= mutated vowel. The
other letters have their literal meaning.","[78, 79, 80]"
"                             §101. Possessive Pronoun
    The regular possessive pronoun is simply the objective series of
the personal pronoun with a few changes. It appears however in two
forms, one with and one without the possessive suffix -me, the first
used with relationship terms and body-part nouns to indicate inalien-
able possession and the second with all other nouns to indicate alienable
possession. The second series can however be employed with body-part
nouns when they specifically express separation from the body.
    The main difference between the personal and the possessive series
is the use of the old form mesa for the third plural, and the dual ka,
ku with all the plural forms, although tse'kato is also found. The series
follows:
                                Alienable               Inalienable
            my                    ime-                    i-
            your                  mi'me-                  mi-
            his                   te'me-, me'me-          te-
            our (dual)            *isa'kame-              i'saka-
            our (plural)          i'same-                 i'sa-
            your (dual)           *mi'sakamc-             mi'saka-
            your (plural)         mi'same-                mi'sa-
            their (dual)          me'sakame               me'saka-
            their (plural)        me'sa-, tsek&'tame      me'sa-, tseko'to
                                  *(me'same, not found)
   Phonetically all these forms are proclitics, but in the singular the
fusion with the stem seems much closer.
    1. Alienable possession.
    i'memetai', my wife; i'melel, my rock; imetcu'itcu, my dog; imeme'tse, my
arrow; mimetcu'itcu, your dog; temetcu'itcu, his dog.

      ia'ya, my father; ie'pa, my older brother; i'nvk, my friend; ihu"", my head;

      But:
      imets*e'ma, my (detached) ear; imet-o'l, my (detached) hair.
    Possessive -me has, we have seen, become a general nominal pos-
sessive (cf. §93).
    There are a few sporadic indications of an older series to which
some weight should be attached. pe""u, penis, was found in the form
haipe""u, my penis, and when this is compared with mai' reflexive
pronoun frequently used as inalienable possessive third person one
gets the impression of a series. *hai-, first person, *mai', third person,
which might be analyzed into ha, I, ma-, indefinite object, and *i
possessive for inalienable possession to be contrasted with -me.
    An exceedingly important special use of the third person inalienable
and alienable (te-, meme-) in the sense of Latin eius and suus runs
through the whole language (cf. §32).
    Apparently Wappo as compared with Yuki proper has developed
its possessive suffix independently, the former from an old demon-
strative ma, used today as indefinite verbal object, and the latter from
the demonstrative te still found in both languages.","[144, 145]"
"            §26. Changes in the Phonetic Character of the Stem
    The changes in the phonetic character of the verbal stem are of
five distinct types:
    1. Modification of initial consonant.
    2. Modification of stem vowel.
    3. Modification of terminal vowel of disyllabic stem.
    4. Apocope of terminal vowel of disyllabic stems.
    5. Accretion of consonant.
    For the first two the evidence is derived almost entirely from the
dictionary. In other words it is not a process functional today. It
is of so clear-cut a nature, however, and so important, that it must be
mentioned here. The consonant mutation (ablaut) is of two kinds,
either from unglottalized to glottalized stop or affricative, for example,
or from one to another of the same or of a related sound series, i.e.,
either from tc>ts or c>tc. The vowel mutation (ablaut) consists
either in a simple change (a>i, i>a>e, etc.) or in diphthongization.
Not infrequently vocalic and consonantal ablaut occur together. It is
important to remember that not only did the vowel of a monosyllabic
stem of the type c+v become ablauted but, very frequently also, that
of a disyllabic stem (c+v+c+v). In the latter case the terminal
vowel often retains its proper value.
    The changes in the nature of the terminal vowel of disyllabic stems
are in part old, in part secondary. The secondary are due to purely
phonetic causes. The others are intimately bound up with the expres-
sion of voice, mode, and less consistently, tense, aspect, and plurality.
Apart from the expression of the subjunctive and plurality, each mode,
aspect, etc., has a definite vowel associated with it, i.e., the passive
always has -u-, the hortatory -a-, the imperative singular generally -e,
and the indefinite generally -i. We may consequently assume that we
are here, in reality, dealing with true formatives. This is quite true,
yet it is well to remember, at the same time, that formatives are, in
origin, simply mutated vowels, secondarily and possibly recently pet-
rified and reinterpreted.
1929]            Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                 25    The nominal stem shows only one example of ablaut, namely-the
subjective case which is formed by the mutation of all terminal vowels
of disyllabic stems to -i. TQ this must be added the regular change of
the plural suffix -te to -ti and of dual koto to kati in the subjective.
    The development of terminal vowel mutations into true formatives
possibly has an important bearing on the next type of change we must
consider-the loss of terminal vowel. This loss occurs frequently in
the indefinite and the past. It can be best explained by assuming that
as the terminal vowel came to be regarded as a formative associated
with specific meaning it was felt to be a detachable element and was
then frequently lost under favorable phonetic conditions, etc.
    The accretion of a consonant presents no difficulties. These conso-
nants are all old suffixes, sometimes charged with specific meaning, at
other times vague, or with no meaning perceptible at present.
    The irregular survival of ablauted, apocopated, and increment
stems in one form or another has given rise to such irregularity that
today the verbs must be grouped into distinct classes on the basis of
the form assumed by the indefinite as contrasted with the future and
past. The indefinite stem shows mutated vowel, loss of vowel and loss
of syllable while the future-past shows retention of vowel and increments.","[33, 34]"
"                         §§90-91. PREFIXATION
                             §90. Introduction
     Prefixation is apparently an old process in nouns and one that is
still exhibiting considerable strength. The noun-formatives ma-, ho-,
na- and the possessive prefixes me-, te-, -mesa, to which must be added
the vestigial hai-, hu-, and the reflexive mai-, are among the oldest in
the language, while k-a-, human, te- plural? -demonstrative, and on-
plural are certainly very recent additions. It seems today as if the
same tendency that has led te- demonstrative to develop into a prefix
is extending to other demonstratives (tse, he) and converting them into
prefixed articles. In one word this has already taken place, tse'hasi,
old man (literally, the old-one). The vigor of this drift is possibly
only one aspect of nominal stem-composition, a process that shows no
indication of abating.
    ma-, ho-, na- are apparently old demonstratives, ma- non-existent
today, ho, a variant of he, and na- non-existent today but perhaps
identical with ne- in ne-wela, inside. All three are generally connected
with nominalized verb or neutral stems.

merely a variant of demonstrative tse, this, with demonstrative suffix -1.

postposition meaning ""there"" that is on the point of developing into
a suffix.

"             §§81-88. EXPRESSION OF PLURALITY IN VERBS
                             §81. Introduction
    The expression of plurality in Wappo does not play a role in Wappo
comparable to that which it enjoys in lang,uages like Pomo, Salinan,
and Washo. Indeed it seems, on the whole, unimportant. There are,
however, four methods of forming it, all vestigial, it is true, but still
functional. If we add the plural imperative and the doubtful dual
there are six methods. These are:
        1. Stem differentiation        4. -1
        2. -c                          5. -mi (imperative)
        3. -te                         6. -ku? (dual)
    The importance of these methods lies in the fact that the neighboring
Pomo and Washo (?) possess all of them except -e and that Salinan and
Achomawi have a number of them. Indeed these particular elements
and, in general, an exuberant development of the expression of plurality,
are characteristic of Hokan. It seems not so characteristic of Cali-
fornian Penutian but appears again in Sapir's extended Penutian
(Tsimshian, Chinook). Pomo shows what must have been the original
meaning of these numerous differentiations. There we find the singu-
larity of the subject and object carefully differentiated from the plurality
of the subject and object, in the first person, the third person, and the
imperative, thus yielding the following scheme:
                 singular-singular        plural-singular
                singular-plural           plural-plural
118         University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.        [VoL 27   It is quite possible that the same scheme once existed in Wappo
and Yukian in general and that such imperative forms as -lumi, -tdlumi,
-kdlumi are the remnants of it.","[126, 127]"
"                            §47. Historical Discussion
    Today the old specific meanings of the nine bases are, with few
exceptions, gone. Only the passive in -u- and the hortatory in -a- and
a few of the expanded or increment forms have survived in any func-
tional sense. They have all apparently had slightly different histories.
The intensive and diminutive have simply increased the vocabulary.
The same is true of the durative and to a lesser degree of the active
and inactive. These last three, particularly the first, have surviv'ed
68          Un.iversity of Calitfornia PubUlcatio,w in Am. Arch. and Ethm.      [Vol. 27in certain of the tense-aspects. In large measure, however, the original
changes that characterized all but some of the increment forms have
been levelled down. The original, unchanged, and unincremented
form, which apparently expressed single momentaneous activity, has
lost that force and acquired an indefinite significance. The increment
bases, especially those in -te-, 1-, -mak-, -lek-, have become restricted
to the future and past tenses.
    A few irregularly distributed survivals of some of the intensive
and diminutive forms occur, giving rise to peculiar forms for the passive,
for the reflexive, for the transitive and intransitive, and even for
certain tenses and modes.","[76, 77]"

                         §115. Demonstrative Pronouns
    Practically all the demonstratives (te-, tse-, he-), have developed
into definite articles and tse and he have likewise taken upon them-
selves the force of conjunctions, the former in connection with sub-
ordination, the latter as ""and.""
    tets&'ti, the bone; tehu'tsi, the eye; tetu'tsi, the large one; teku'tiyi, the small

"                     §88. Expression of Plural Today
    In present-day Wappo all the old methods of forming the plural
are disappearing and the pronoun oni, they, seems to be carrying the
whole burden. There is also a tendency to use -ti the nominal plural
suffix and mul, all.
1929]           Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language                 121
                         §§89-99. THE NOUN
                         §89. The Nominal Stem
    The nominal stem forms a much simpler unit than that of the verb.
Like the latter it consists of a stem with prefixes and suffixes. The
prefixes are, however, few in number. With the exception of the pro-
nominal possessive there are only three very sparingly used formatives.
True suffixes are on the whole scarce, being either old formatives or
expressing case relations.
    In addition to prefixation and suffixation the only processes used
extensively are a loose type of stem-composition, sporadic reduplication
(only with onomatopoeic words), and a few instances of stem-differ-
entiation for singular and plural. Vocalic ablaut either basic or terminal
is absent, although a few nominal bases differ from related verbal ones
by vowel alternations. This appears, however, secondary and unim-
portant and is unconnected with the old fundamental vocalic mutation
of the verbal bases.","[129, 130]"
"                        69. Formation of the Past Tense
    Wappo possesses two suffixes and one proclitic for expressing the
past tense, -ta, -ki (k), and u. Of these we have seen (§32) that -ta
had probably a different function originally and that -ki was infer-
ential in meaning. We are thus left with u, an element not very ex-
tensively used today. Yet a comparison with Yuki proper shows that
it is the original sign of the past. In Yuki the past is -wi, -u.
    Both -ta and -ki appear in a large number of increment forms (-lta,
-lekta, -makta, -kta, -sta, -cta and -1ki, -teki, -steki, -ski, -cki). The
forms -teta, -lekki, -mak-ki, which one would naturally expect, do not
appear at all or in only a very few instances. -teta has probably con-
tracted to -ta and -lekki and -makki have been displaced by -lekta and
-makta.
     1. Pasts in -ta.--ta has in many instances a very definite influence
on the preceding vowel. It either caused its complete disappearance
or its reduction to -e- or -&-. It sometimes follows the analogy of the
indefinite, sometimes that of the future, and sometimes behaves quite
independently. It is not commonly used with indefinites in -sv, -cv.
     a. Pasts with preserved terminal stem vowel. (Not common).
    ik'e'ta, he pewked (ik'e'); oca""ita, he payed (ca""i); ohi'pita, he saved (hi'pi);
otsa'kuta, he shoved with elbow (tso'ku?); hoyu'ita, he took all (yui); hot'a'eta,
he divided (t'a's); huwa'ota, it stuck out (huwa'o).
     b. Pasts with reduced terminal stem vowel (-e-, -L-).
     ikapo'teta, he bothered (ikapo&tu); o'tLta, he sucked (a'ti); ola'ttta, he hit
(la'ti); ota'hota, he shot (to'he).

    The vast majority belonging to this group.
     a's-ta, he gave (a's.i); e'lta, he kept hold (e'lu in indefinite and future); i'lta,
he bound (i'le); oce""ta, he guessed (ce'ha in indefinite and future); ohi""ta, he
buried (hi'hi, follows indefinite); ole'uta, he tied up (le'we?, follows indefinite);
ona'""ta, he saved (na'he, follows indefinite); otaita, he went around (tai'ye);
oye""ta, he set trap (ye'he, follows indefinite); u'k-ta, he drank (u'ki follows
indefinite); ci'uta, he whistled (ci'we): ha""ta, he said (ha quite irregular); ha""ota,
he picked up (ha'we); holi'ta, he drove animals (holi'e follows indefinite); homa'-
s-ta, he missed (homa'sa); ka'n*ta, he took one after another (ka'n-o in indefinite
and future); mai'hota'nta, he warmed himself (hota'nu in indefinite and future).
    d. Contracted forms.
    ku't*a (for ku'teta) he built fire (ku'te); mahu't.a(for mahu'teta) he bet (hu).
    2. Pasts in -ki, -ke, -k.--ki has, on the whole, comparatively little
influence upon the preceding terminal stem-vowel and tends to pre-
serve this vowel with its original value almost to the same extent as
do futures in -si. It follows generally the analogy of the future. In
some cases it preserves the terminal stem-vowel where the future has
lost it.
    a. Pasts with preserved t,erminal stem-vowel.
    Practically always confined to intransitive, inactive, and passive,
etc., verbs.
    omima'kaki, it rained (ma'ka follows future); o'ttaki, he drowned (a't.a follows
future); oha'waki, he bet (ha'wa follows future); omoti'ake, it overflowed (moti'a
follows future); u'kt'take, he was drunk (u'ki'ta follows future); utsi'tcaki, it got
dark (utsi'tca follows future); ca'taki, it was bitter (ca'ta, future ca'tt-); ho-e'wuki,
he was ignorant of (ho-e'wu follows future); amiso'mike, it became evening (somi,
future amiso'mvci).
    b. Pasts with apocopated terminal stem-vowel. (Not common.)
    opa't'ki, he shouted (opa't'e); otc-u'lki, he lay on one side (otcu'la); ho'lki,
he stood (hoTl.a); hotco""lki, he walked (hotc&'ha); kakima'ke (for kakima'kke),
it hailed (kakima'ka); ko""ki, he was lame (ka'ht preserved in indefinite and
future).
    S. Pasts in u.-u is undoubtedly an abbreviated form of u""ku,
already. Its specific force is considerably lost today and it is rarely
found as the sign of the past tense as such, but is always accompanied
by the past tense suffixes -ta, -ki, occasion¶lly with indefinite -ca, -i, etc.
With verbs that take the indefinite and past in -ki it is not infrequently
used to indicate the past.
    It is not used frequently by the younger people today.
    u'k-am'i, he was crying (ka'm'u, having cried is also found); unale""ica, he was
angry; auho't'at-a, I divided it; u'atc-ahe'lta, I took it out already; a'uowa'ttta,
I hit it; uola'tike, he was hit by someone; utst'tstke, it was cooked.

                    §§70-73. Formation of Modes
   There are three modes in Wappo, imperative, subjunctive, and
hortatory. Of these the first two are quite irregular and are formed in
a variety of ways.","[111, 112, 113]"
"                                §42. Absolute
    81. -u, -i, participial-absolute. -u is possibly identical with u past
enclitic and -i with the indefinite suffix. The latter is not common
but the former is fairly frequent and seems to have only a slight past
significance.
    p-i'-u, picking; k.uwe'-u, running; okali'-u, talking; ts-e'sv-u, swimming;
otai""u, singing; kam'u, crying.
    pi'l-i, snowing; mai'hope'l-i, rolling himself; k.o'm-i, boiling; tek-a'nel-i,
packing.
58        University of California PublUoations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.         [Vol. 27    82. -ti, participial-absolute. This is identical with the imperative
-ti. It is exceedingly common in the texts in this participial usage.
    ka't'a-ti, laughing, laughed; tep*e'na-ti, falling down; ca""i-ti, going out;
tc*utsa'ta-ti, becoming well; uhopa't'e-ti, making noise; pa""a-ti, burst; ma'ka-ti,
raining; hok*u'wa-ti, running; mahe'u-ti, jumping in; teni'a-ti, going.
    83. -1, participial-absolute. It is difficult to decide whether to
interpret 4 and the following -k, -s, and -c suffixes (84, 85, 86) as
nominalized verbs or as secondarily developed absolute forms. They
are possibly both, with the probability that in the main, 4 alone ex-
cepted, they have arisen by analogy with nominal -k, -c, -s from the
tense forms in -kv, -cr, -sv. For discussion cf. §80.
    a' k-u'we-l husa'aki, I got tired running; a'ku'we-l tse""Lta, I finished running;
hote'he-l tse*ka ka't'ice, he laughed at his carrying him; k-a'l-l1, carrying; hotco'-
ho-I yaomi, he's going to begin to walk; tetcat'a'n-l, pulling off a point.
     84. -c, participial-absolute. Cf. discussion §80.
    k-atLc a'ka""ta, I heard it boiling; u'k't-c naoci, he sees him drinking; ke'lt-c
wi'-ice mila""ki, are you not ashamed of fighting; omana'o-e-laki, not seeing;
p'i'lmak-c tsetti, where it is snowing; okelu't-c-tsel, when lonesome: mewL'lL-c
tseta, there telling him.
     85. -s, participial-absolute. Cf. discussion §80.
     at'a'pt-s, boiling: mi nal'e'wt-s-la haci, you said you're not getting enough;
meko'lt-s laki, (why) not washing him?
   86. -k, participial-absolute. This is by far the most extensively
used of the last four suffixes treated.
     oka'lv-k tse'Wtt,, he stopped talking; ok*amo-k tse'tta, he stopped crying;
otco'tL-k tsetta, he stopped walking; a' hol mai'-k una'oci, I see the tree standing;
a' hol mv'kv-k na'oci, I see the tree lying; htnka'tala-k k'a'ci, he heard him snoring;
hot-ai'a-k hotsai'use, he tried to sing; hopa'a-k hotsai'use, he tried to eat; tse's*v-k
hotsai'use, he tried to swim.","[66, 67]"
