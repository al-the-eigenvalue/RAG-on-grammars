    Kalpis is used to negate non-verbal existence and possessive clauses, occurring at the end of the
clause. It frequently takes the attributive suffix -en. Kalpis (or sometimes a’a) is also used to answer
yes/no questions and at the end of the clause to strengthen the ake negation of the clause.","[75, 76]"

      Sometimes an additional occurrence of aki at the end of the sentence expresses doubt or hesitation
  (the speaker is not sure about the right alternative):

     Quite often aki occurs in questions in the final position either alone or together with kalpis ‘no’.
  The combination aki kalpis also often expresses accusation or other negative attitude;

5.5.4.      Adversative / Contrastive conjunctions: ari and pake
      Urim has two adversative or contrasting conjunctions: ari and pake. Their uses seem to overlap at
  least partly, although there are cases when the native speakers accept only the other one.                  ari                          expresses a change, sometimes unexpected.

Ari - contrast and surprise
    Ari is the most common contrastive conjunction. Its function is to mark contrast or
contraexpectation. Typically there is an unexpected event or sudden (especially negative) surprise,
sometimes just some new turn of story. Sometimes ari just marks the change of actor or speaker in
discussion, especially if the speaker answers negatively or otherwise against expectations.","[210, 211, 212]"

5.3.6.   ‘Negative’ reason: atnen (a) ‘because of, fault of’
      The word atnen appears to be morphologically composed of the verb itna (atna) ‘stand’ and
  transitive suffix -en. Like eng, it is basically a preposition. When a clause follows this preposition, a
  relative clause marker (?) a is usually added after it (atnen a). This shows that all occurrences of
  atnen should probably be analyzed as a preposition having either a NP or a nominalized clause as the
  head. Semantically, atnen (a) usually refers to the reason for something bad happening.",[194]

5.5.3.      Disjunctive / Alternative conjunction aki ‘or’
         The alternative conjunction aki ‘or’ is used to connect both noun phrases and clauses:                      Ake     wrik watipmen itna           kar    ti.   Kitn aki kil ai      kai

"       Nouns are not usually derived from other words by suffixes, but compound noun stems are
    common (see the Chapter 2. 12).
  2.3.1.      Important Semantic Classes of Nouns
       Among nouns, the following semantic distinctions have significant morpho-syntactic
    consequences.              1.   personal (thought of as being in the same class as people) versus non-personal
              2.   potent (self-moving) versus non-potent
              3.   temporal versus non-temporal nouns
              4.   inherently related nouns (inalienably possessed nouns)
    Personal Nouns
           Personal nouns have the following morpho-syntactic properties:              1.   They are questioned by a distinct interrogative word mla ‘who? Sg/Pl. Non-personal
                   nouns are questioned with kuina (or na) ‘what?’              2.   They are optionally explicitly pluralized using the third person plural independent pronoun
                   tu in a noun complex construction, e.g. tu melnum ‘they person / people’, and, in addition,
                   they can sometimes be reduplicated. As is the case with other nouns, reduplication
                   indicates indefinite plurality. The kinship words man ‘mother’ and yan ‘father’ can
                   additionally have an plural (?) suffix -in, tu yantin ‘the fathers’ (this suffix is not
                                                                                                          32
              productive, and occurs only in few words). Non-personal nouns are overtly pluralized
              either by reduplication or the use of quantifiers.","[31, 32]"

5.3.5.   Strong reason: eng ntei
      The basic meaning of eng ntei is interrogative ‘why?’; its use to mark strong reasons is secondary.
  Strong reason means here, that the speaker feels an extra need of explanation (answers to a question
  etc.), or wants to emphasize the reason. The expression eng ntei in this use is not very common in
  texts - all examples below are elicited. Its function is much the same as an ordinary rhetoric question,
  which the speaker himself answers. Its use probably reflects the influence of Tok Pisin bilong
  wanem.","[192, 193]"
"
    Torricelli phylum languages have been thought to be basically Papuan languages which have been
subjected to heavy Austronesian influence. There are some Austronesian languages along the north
coast. Word order is one of the Austronesian features in the Torricelli language group, since Papuan
languages usually are SOV- languages. It is a common theory that SVO- languages often have
developed from earlier SOV-languages either through the influence of some neighbouring SOV-
languages or from language internal reasons. One of these reasons could be the disappearance of
morphological case-marking, which in a way forces the language to rely on the word order in marking
these functions. (Givón 1979a 145-146). If a language were to change its word order from SOV to
SVO, it would be expected that there would be some residues from the former SOV-type structure.
The more recent this change has been, the more residues would be expected. Word order change
most commonly starts from the main-clause level, and later spreads into more complex structures.
According to Givón (1984:220-228). “the longer a language has maintained a rigid OV or VO word
order, the more it is likely to bear out Greenberg’s predictions (1966).” If this is true, then Urim has
been SVO-language at least during the last two thousand years, since it is an unusually pure SVO-
language following all the predictions that Greenberg mentions. All modifiers of the noun phrase and
almost the entire verb phrase occur after the head. There are suffixes, but this is quite a common
feature in SVO-languages in general, and not a strong indicator of a recent change of word order.
Most commonly the residue of the presumed word order would occur in dependent and embedded
clauses and other structures like nominalizations and idioms. But in Urim these have SVO-word
order, except when the subject referent is generic:
       (27)   Kil    ariwe    hapm        angkut.
              3sg    know.R cloth         sew.R
              ‘She knows how to sew.’
    This is the only observed possible residue of a former SOV-word order. Assuming this theory is
right Urim is an almost ideal SVO-language typologically. One could perhaps question if it were
easier to derive a language like Urim from an Austronesian group having some heavy Papuan

influences than the other way around? But this and the whole question of the classification of Urim
needs much more work before any definite answers or even suggestions can be given.
                                                                                                          172                               5. Complex sentences        Usually three types of subordinate clauses are distinguished in languages: those which function as
    arguments of the predicate (i.e. complements), those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative
    clauses), and those which function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (adverbial
    clauses). (Thompson and Longacre, 171). We can find these clause types also in Urim, although with
    adverbial clauses it is difficult to distinguish between subordinated adverbial clauses and more
    coordinate combinations of clauses. Therefore we conflate the description of adverbial clauses and
    coordinate combinations of sentences.","[170, 171, 172]"

     Phonologically ai behaves like other clitics; it is pronounced together with previous word and is
usually unstressed. Native speakers generally write it as an independent word same way as other
clitics.

      Another possible connection exists between ai and the interrogative pronoun ahi. The phonetic
  form of the interrogative pronoun can be derived from the word ai by adding rising question
  intonation. As the result of rising intonation the second vowel /i/ lengthens. After that the word is re-
  syllabified and /h/ is added between the vowels to mark the syllable break. Notice, that also the
  demonstrative pronoun ai tends to have indefinite meaning.","[98, 99]"

  constituent being questioned normally occurs in declarative sentences. Some sentential examples of
  the use of interrogative words are given below:         who?
                        Kitn        mla               (pa)?         -Kupm    Mowal.

                        ‘Who (sg) did that?’
  10 In the expressions ahi and kolai there is a clear syllable boundary heard between the vowels /a/ and /i/.
  Intonationally, the /a/ often has a higher pitch than what precedes it and it is followed by a rise on the /i/ starting lower
  than the /a/.

        Typologically it is a common phenomenon that rigid word order and lack of morphological case
    markings occur together in a language. This is especially common in SVO-languages like Urim.
    Urim does not have any case marking morphology on either the subject or object, nor is there any
    agreement marked on the verb either. Since there is no morphological way to mark which noun
    phrase in the clause is subject and which is object, the syntactic position of the noun phrase before or
    after the verb is what shows its syntactic function. Not only the subject and transitive object are
    unmarked, but also all other obligatory arguments of a verb are morphologically unmarked. This
    increases the importance of word order for delineating the functions of NPs in the clause. The
    following examples illustrate how a change of word order changes the meaning of clauses and even
    the clause type:

    Urim has been classified as a Papuan language, stock level isolate in the Torricelli Phylum.. The
question of isolation can be re-considered when some of the neighbouring languages have been
studied in more detail. All Torricelli languages display some similarities with Austronesian
languages: fixed SVO word order, lack of medial verbs, use of transitivity-changing suffixes and
realis-irrealis mood, etc. It seems that Urim has these non-Papuan features to a greater extent than
many other Torricelli languages. It lacks subject-agreement on the verb, and is also in other respects
morphologically simpler than the other Torricelli phylum languages.","[169, 170]"

to mark the construction as a phrase, and it also has the semantical meaning ‘with’ (see also section
4.5.2.2). These phrases often function as adverbials in the sentence :                  Kiin        kipman-en

Disjunctive nominal phrases
    The disjunctive conjunction aki ’or’ conjoins both phrases and clauses. It also functions as a tag
in questions. Here we only present some examples of it conjoining noun phrases. Other uses of aki
are described later in the section 5.5.3.                  man      al-kil    aki     man     a-kupm       aki,       tu...

                      ‘Is she sick or what is wrong? Did she get malaria or what?’3.4. What is Verb Phrase in Urim?
        The term verb phrase is used in two senses. ‘Traditionally, it refers to a group of verbs which
    together have the same syntactic function as a single verb (is coming, may be coming, get up to). In
    such phrases, one verb is the main verb and the others are subordinate to it. In generative grammar,
    the verb phrase has a much broader definition, being equivalent to the whole of the predicate of a
    sentence’ (Crystal pp.325-326).
        In this grammar the different types of predicates will be described later in the Chapter 4 ‘Urim
    Basic Clause Types’. If we follow the traditional definition of verb phrase, most serial phrases do fit
    the definition, but not all of them. Many serial verb phrases function syntactically as prepositions.
    Negation and some modality could possibly be described as part of verb phrase, but the scope of most
    modal particles is rather the whole clause or sentence than verb phrase. Therefore it might be better to
    leave the whole term ‘verb phrase’ out of Urim grammar.. Serial structures have already been
    described in the sections 3.2.7 and 3.3.6. The grammatical functions commonly expressed in
    languages within verb phrases, like negation, modality and time, have been partly described earlier
    (3.2.2.) but we will shortly discuss them here too.
  3.4.1.   Negation
        Negation is usually considered part of verb phrase. In Urim the verbal negator ake normally
    occurs immediately before the verb (or serial verb phrase), but is often also placed first in the clause,
    especially in answers:                      Kil          ake         kul
                      3sg          NEG         come
                      ’She did not come.’                      Kalpis,       ake         kil    ari
                      no           NEG         3sg    see
                      ’No, he did not see (it)’
        Also non-verbal equative and descriptive clauses are negated with the word ake. Existence
    clauses and verbless possessive clauses instead are negated using the word kalpis(en):
                                                                                                     147                   Ake            wang       a   kai

                   1sg          NEG        fish     lie
                   ’I do not have fish’     Obligations are negated by ampake’should not’, akentiwe ‘cannot’, and am(p)ur ‘don’t’. Also the
  combination ake mpa is often used in negative exhortations. All these occur first in the clause.
  Akentive can be interpreted as a idiomatized phrase (ake antive ‘not enough/able’). All these
  expressions are more like clause adverbs than parts of verb phrase.","[144, 145, 146, 147]"

2.3.3.   Lack of Nominalized Forms
      Many forms in Urim may function either as nouns or verbs, with no overt morphological marking
  a change of word class. The following two pairs of sentences illustrate this (for further details, see
  Section 5. 2. 1):                   Tu     alm-wrong
                   2pl    shoot-crowd

  2.4.1.     Pronouns (Pro-NPs)
        Urim has a set of free pronouns (more properly pro-Noun phrases), a set of bound Object
    pronominal clitics, and a set of genitive pronouns. In interrogative sentences, a number of different
    interrogative pronouns can occur. Reciprocal action is expressed by the same pronoun for all persons
    and numbers. Each of these types of pronouns will now be examined in more detail.
    Independent / Free Pronouns
         There are thirteen independent pronouns in Urim. These distinguish the following semantic
    categories: 1) first, second, and third persons, 2) singular, dual, paucal, and plural numbers, and 3) (in
    just the first person plural pronouns) whether or not the hearer is included.","[37, 38, 39]"

   anaphora
  6.2.1.   Introducing new participants and referents to discourse
         In Urim new participants and referents are introduced by various means: full NP, full NP plus
    relative clause, full NP plus indefinite ur, full NP plus the demonstrative pa, full NP plus a
    combination of ur and pa. In addition, there are also special clause and phrase types, which are used
    for introducing new participants.
         New items that are not topical, are usually introduced by a full noun phrase, with or without the
    indefinite quantifier ur. Ur is not used if it is clear from the context that there can be only one
    referent:                       Kil   no             minip, kaino            karpo              kwokg

    There are different ways to introduce topical new referents. Left dislocations and special
presentative constructions are used. This is especially the case at the beginning of texts, but also
happens sometimes at the beginning of a new paragraph.. When new main participants are introduced
in a narrative text, very often the combination of ur pa is used (with or without left dislocation). Here
the indefinite ur expresses that the participant is new information, while the demonstrative pa marks
the referent of the NP as topical. If the identity of the new participant is further specified by a
relative clause, pa is not used:                  Kiin    wekg ur pa         ekg     naren        ampen         tukgwain.

inherently definite NPs like pronouns or proper nouns, the beginning of a story is often marked by
adding pa or ur pa to a sentence-initial time adverbial.","[247, 248]"

2.7.5.      Modal Adverbs
      In Urim most modal notions are encoded using modal verb + VP/S complement constructions, or
  various serial constructions. One of the negative words explained in the previous section could be
  analyzed as a modal verb; am(p)ur ‘don’t’.
      There are also a few modal adverbs in Urim. Imperatives are encoded with a sentence final modal
  adverb that is cliticized onto the last word of the sentence:                      Kai      o!
                      go       IMP
                      ‘Go!’                      Tepm         kaino      om

                      ‘Let us go now!’         Permissive imperative is encoded with repeating the predicate at the beginning of the sentence:                      Kai        kitn      kai    o!
                      go         2sg       go     IMP
                      ’You may go now!’ or ‘Okay, go now!’
                                                                                                     78    Urim also has two modal adverbs that are used to encode probability; pilpa ‘perhaps, must be’ and
kol ‘possibly’. The word kol also has several other usages; therefore it will be described in more
detail in Section 5.6. It is commonly used in conditional or other clauses where the event or action is
less probable. It is not used when the condition is considered a fact or at least quite possible.","[77, 78]"

otherwise important items to the text. In this combination ur has only the meaning of indefiniteness:                 Wang ur pa, mentekg Karis hel                 kainil.

2.9. Demonstratives
        There are four demonstratives. Each of these can have both referential and psychological uses.
    All can also be used to refer to time and as parts of pro-adverbs. The basic deictic functions of these
    demonstratives are as follows:
     ti      ‘this, here’ indicates physical nearness to the speaker, to the hearer, or to both. It can also
             indicate psychological nearness to the speaker.
     pa      ‘that, there’ indicates a referent that is some distance away from the speaker, the hearer, or both.
             The referent is usually near enough to be seen. Pa can also signal an indefinite distance.
     ai      ‘far away, over there, somewhere’ is phonetically a clitic, but native speakers usually write it
             separately. Ai indicates that a referent is relatively far away from both the speaker and hearer.
             The referent is usually not near enough to be seen. Ai also often indicates an indefinite spatial
             or temporal distance.
     kil     ‘3sg; this, here’ marks physical or psychological nearness and is sometimes used instead of ti
             when referring to humans or animals, or when the proximity of a referent is emphasized. Kil is
             basically a third person singular pronoun with its use as demonstrative pronoun being secondary
             (see section 2.4).","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"
    The important notion of transitivity distinguishes the two most common basic clause types in any
language: intransitive and transitive clauses. There are degrees of transitivity in clauses, since the
notion of transitivity is a graded continuum (Givon 1984: 98, 152-157). In the prototypical, highly
transitive clause the subject referent is a volitional, controlling agent or a non-volitional cause/effector
                                                                                                                          154and the object is a concrete, result-registering effect or patient. Many objects are less than
prototypical
    In Urim certain clause types have an intermediate degree of transitivity, and are therefore called
here semitransitive. Clearly transitive verb stems are not as common in Urim as in many other
languages. Many verbs can have both transitive (or semitransitive) and intransitive (or reflexive) uses
( 1a), (1b), with no morphologically marking to indicate a change in transitivity. In Urim transitive
verbs are often derived from intransitive ones via addition of the transitive suffixes -en or -e.3. These
suffixes can increase the transitivity of an intransitive verb or clause, making it transitive or
semitransitive (1a), (1c). They can also change semitransitive verbs into fully transitive verbs.
Consider the following examples:
        (1a)     Kil       hokg rmpa             nung.
                 3sg       sleep lie.R           log

                 ‘He slept by the fire.’                         (semitransitive - result of a productive rule)        (1c)     Kil         hokg          kiin.

                 ‘The child cries for taro.’                     (intermediate degree of transitivity)
3 The suffix -en is much more common and occurs with all kinds of intransitive verbs, while the suffix -e increases the
transitivity of motion verbs only and occurs more frequently as a continuative aspect marker.

                  ‘Child cries after father.’                     (transitive - inflectional)4.2. Intransitive Clauses
        The basic difference between transitive and intransitive clauses is that an intransitive verb has
    only one obligatory argument, whereas a transitive verb has two or more obligatory arguments. In
    Urim the difference between obligatory and optional nominal constituents of the clause is quite
    consistently reflected in the surface structure. The obligatory constituents are almost always
    morphologically unmarked noun phases (no prepositions, no markings on the verb), whereas optional
    constituents are usually expressed as prepositional phrases. There are only a few exceptions to this
    rule. With certain verbs the second obligatory NP in the clause ( the second argument of the verb) is
    morphologically unmarked when it is a pronoun, but requires a preposition when it is a full noun
    phrase. These verbs are probably on the borderline between transitive and intransitive verbs Thus
    far only a few verbs of this type have been found.           (4a)   Tu           wakrongen-tetn.
                  3pl          like  - 2sg.O
                  ‘They like you.’           (4b)   Tu      wakrongen        eng          mansan
                  3pl     like             PUR          parents
                  ‘They love their parents’
       The subject of an intransitive clause always occurs before the verb and can exhibit almost any
    semantic role. In this respect intransitive clauses differ from all other clause types in Urim.           (5a)   Hu             awe             wail             paipm.
                  water          rain.R          big              bad
                  ‘It’s raining hard.’           (5b)   Nampa           haru.
                  dog             bark
                  ‘The dog barks.’
           (5c)   Hapm       plalng.
                  cloth      finished
                  ‘There are no more clothes left.’           (5d)   Tu           warim          akatnong.
                  3pl          child          play.R
                  ‘The children are playing.’
                                                                                                                         156
      In Urim the subject noun phrase is obligatory in all basic clause types. Even expressions
  describing natural phenomena which in many languages have no semantic or surface subjects, or have
  a ‘dummy’ subject (like the it in English it rains) require overt subjects in Urim (5a). In text clauses,
  however, subjects are often absent as the result of ellipsis, when the identity of the subject referent is
  clear from the previous context.
4.2.1.     Time Clauses
      There are two structurally peculiar types of clause that could be described as subtypes of the
  intransitive clause. One of them, which is here called the time clause, consists of one element only;
  a noun phrase denoting time of day. The reasons why these words are not considered lexical verbs
  are: 1) these time words do not have any case frame with arguments, in other words, the time clause
  never has any other obligatory elements except the time word itself, which functions both as the
  subject and the predicate of the clause. 2) In Urim nouns and verbs do not usually have the same
  morphological form in the lexicon (like English ‘love’ or ‘fish’ for example), although verbs and verb
  phrases can easily be nominalized without any formal marking. 3) Another reason fro classifying time
  words as nouns is that adjectives can be formed from them by the suffix –et. This is rare with verbs.
  4) Aspectual, temporal, and modal particles can occur in this time clause the same way as in verbal
  clauses. This is possible, because they do not belong to the verbal morphology but are clausal
  particles.
      Time words also resemble verbs semantically more closely than most other nouns, since the
  points of time are not actually fixed units but processes. Normally nouns represent the most
  permanent states, verbs the most rapidly changing states, and adjectives are somewhere in between
  (Givon 1979a: 265-266).4
      The time clause is fairly common in texts but is sometimes difficult to differentiate from
  dislocations.
          (6a)      Kong,      atom          men                   kai.
                    morning    then          1pl.Exc               go
                    ‘When the morning came, we left’           (6b)     Mining       ise.
                    dark/night PERF
                    ‘The night has fallen/ It has become dark.’
  4 In Urim time is not associated with location like in many other languages (Lyons 1977:669). No locative prepositions
  appear in time adverbials; instead the verb ak ‘do’ is used. This word is used also as the instrumental and manner phrase
  marker.
                                                                                                            157
4.2.2.   Clauses Predicating Existence
      Another subtype of intransitive clause, the existence clause, is also common in the texts. It
  usually takes the same sort of posture verbs as the locative clause as predicates, but does not have any
  locative object. Another difference from locative clauses (described in the section 6.4.2) is that the
  negative form of existence clause is always verbless, and it is possible to omit the verb in some
  positive existence clauses as well. Verbal clauses are negated using the verbal negative particle ake
  (see example 7d), but in a negated existence clause the nominal negative word kalpis is used instead,
  and the verb is missing.
         (7a)    Men     kai-nar      ari      nangnang pa kalpis.
                 1pl.Exc go-descend but        singsing    D not
                 ‘We went down but there was no singsing-feast’     (7b)        Kitn        yul                rmpa?           Yul            rmpa          pa!

                 ‘Do you have any fish?                          ‘Yes, I do have some fish.’         (7c)    Kitn        yul                rmpa?           Yul             kalpis!
                 2sg         fish               lie.R           fish            not
                 ‘Do you have any fish?                          ‘There is no fish!’     (7d)        Kupm      ake            yul           rmpa!
                 1sg       NEG            fish          lie.R
                 ‘I do not have fish!’
      Another special feature of this clause type is that the subject can easily occur after the verb. In
  other intransitive clauses this is very rare and probably impossible in other clause types.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"

      Many rules, especially the schwa-rule (rule 10) but also most consonant insertion rules (rules 1, 2)
  and the palatalization rule (rule 7) are conditioned by stress so that they either occur only in
  unstressed syllables (schwa-rule) or in or after stressed syllables (consonant insertions).
      Assimilation rules 7 and 8 and dissimilation rules 9 and 10 apply only inside a phonological word
  (except rule 7 b: t --> ts change after palatalization, which can occur over word boundaries). These
  rules serve to help in recognizing the phonological word.
      Insertion and deletion rules 1-6 apply frequently over word boundaries in phrases and also
  elsewhere in rapid speech. The closer knit the structure is, the more regularly most of these rules
  apply.","[18, 19]"

5.3.4.   Purpose-reason clauses marked by eng
      The basic function of the word eng is to mark oblique arguments. As a preposition, it governs
  especially indirect objects (mostly Benefactive and Recipient roles) and also some direct objects of
  less transitive verbs. To show the range of eng, I will first present here some examples of its use
  governing noun phrases and then examples of its use as a complementizer within subordinate clauses.
  Eng with noun phrases and clauses
     Prepositional phrases with eng are used to encode various types of Oblique arguments. It is
  commonly used to encode Benefactive-Recipient and Subject Matter ‘about/concerning’:                   Uwi        pa iye           kul      eng      kupm!

1.1.5.    Stress in Urim
      Stressed vowels are usually longer, louder and less ballistic than the unstressed vowels. (Stress
  has to have at least two of these features.) Stress is assigned to the word on the basis on the relative
  height of the vowels involved. The stress is assigned to the vowel in the word that is the most open,
  or to the second/last vowel if they are equally open.
      The phonetic components of word stress are length (of vowel or whole syllable) and intensity.
  Pitch is not a component of stress but functions independently at the clause level. This makes it
  somewhat difficult to analyse the stress of words in isolation in Urim. Usually stress falls on the first
  or second syllable of the word. The suffixes ( –e, -en, etc.) never get stress.
                   /’topen/       <atopen>          ‘to rejoice’
                   /’k:mu/      <ikgamu>          ‘greens sp.’
                   /’tlpuk/       <talpuk>          ‘tree branch’
                   /u’ri:pm/       <wripm>           ‘wind’
                   /’tpon/        <tapon>           ‘wring’
                   /ti’pon/        <tipon<           ‘wring (irrealis)’1
      Certain morphological and phonologial features seem to co-occur with word stress in Urim.
  Morphemic length of vowels and glides usually occur only in stressed syllables, and the vowels of
  stressed syllables often are phonetically long.
      In unstressed syllables preceding the stressed syllables, all vowels nearly always get reduced.
  Reduced means that the full vowel /e, , o, u/ becomes centralized, short, sometimes phonetically
  non-existent or sometimes it takes on the qualities of the stressed vowel following. This reduction
  rule only operates inside the morpheme not over morpheme boundaries (except in a few strongly  1 A phonetic analysis of tapon and tipon was made at Turku Univerity Phonetic Department 1984.      It was found that in
  irrealis form the vowel shortens so much that the vowel disappears altogether phonetically. The pitch and intensity
  contours instead are similar in both words.
                                                                                                            11    lexicalized cases like pipa /p-p/ [p’pa] 'if'. Compare the following examples: rmpa /rmp/
    [rmp] 'lie', armpen /rm-en/ [rmpen] 'buy'.
         Pitch and length are the main phonetic components clause and sentence intonation. Higher pitch
    and lengthening of vowel mark interrogative clauses. Same features also occur at the end of tail-head
    lingkages: .... kil rpma [rpma:]. Kil rpma [rpma::]...... ‘...... he stayed. He stayed and ....’.
    Normally clause rhytm places the main stress to stressed syllables of words, but interrogatives and
    tail-head lingkages are exceptions.
  1.1.6.      About Orthography
        The phoneme /h/ is marginal. There are few one syllable minimal pairs that could be confusing
    but usually the context helps to determine the right meaning. Therefore /h/ is not written in the
    practical orthography.
           <or> [o:r] ‘beat’                  <or> [ho(:)r] ‘go,come in/out’
           <am> [m] ‚now’                    <am> [hm] ’hide’
           <a>    [] ‘and, REL’              <a> [h:]      ‘wander’         The reduced vowel [] is handled in the orthography in two different ways: it is not symbolized
    at all, or it is symbolized either with <i> or <u>.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

                  ‘I carried it but it was heavy’ or: ‘carried and it felt heavy’
    Ari seems to more often mark negative rather than positive changes or surprises in the story. This
tendency is highlighted in the way it combines with the negator kalpis to emphasize even more the
negative nature of the surprising event. The combination ari kalpis is commonly used in narrative
texts to indicate a turning point of a story.","[212, 213]"
"    Sometimes ai is used as an alternative for pa to mark general remoteness in contrast with the
near demonstrative ti. This happens because in certain contexts pa would be always interpreted as a
discourse marker. For example when pa occurs after the indefinite quantifier ur, the combination ur
pa indicates the introduction of a new topic to the discourse.
    When occurring together with indefinite pronoun ur, ai usually also has the meaning of
indefiniteness; it refers either to indefinite amount or to the indefiniteness of the referent itself.
Consider the following examples:                  Uwi      hipm ur ai       kul!
                  get.IR   leaf   ID remote come
                  ‘Bring some leaves!’
                                                                                                           98                  Mla     ur     ai     kul
                  who     ID     remote came
                  ‘Whoever came’                  melnum      ur       ai
                  man         ID       remote
                  ‘somebody / an unknown man’                  compare to:
                  melnum        ur    pa
                  man           ID that
                  ‘This certain man’ (introducing a new participant)
    Ai is used as far demonstrative instead of pa also with locative words like hen ‘inside’ or wompel
‘other side’. For example, the expression wan wunen pa could easily be interpreted as ‘in the
mentioned house’ or ‘inside the house’ (as contrast to outside) in discourse context:                  Kil   kawor       wompel       ai
                  3sg   go.in      other         remote

                  ‘I live on this side (of the river)’                  Wan        wunen        ti
                  house      inside       this
                  ‘Inside this house’                  Wan        wunen ai
                  house      inside   remote
                  ‘Inside that house’                  Kawekg hipm rpma wunen ai,                kiyom hipm rpma hen                 ti
                  tree.sp. leaf    sit.R inside remote tree.sp. leaf sit.R outside              here
                  ‘Kawekg-leaves are (bound) inside (the arm), kiyom-leaves outside (upper part of the
                  arm)    Notice that in the last example ai and ti are clearly in contrast and the referent marked with ai is
not very distant spatially from that marked with ti.","[97, 98]"

    Urim is a non-Austronesian language spoken in Papua New Guinea. Laycock (1973) classifies it as a
    stock-level isolate of the Torricelli Phylum. It is spoken by about 3400 people, who live in 16 villages
    in the southern foothills of the Torricelli Mountains. Twelve of the villages are located south of the
    Sepic Highway, and one is north of the highway, in the Maprik Sub-District of East Sepik Province. The
    remaining three of the villages are located west of the Bongos River in the Nuku Sub-District of the
    West Sepik Province. The villages west of the Bongos River speak the Kukwo dialect, and the villages
    east of the Bongos River speak the main Urim dialect (also called Yangkolen by the Kukwo people).
    The Urim language has also been called Kalp, which comes from the word kalpm ‘no’ in the Kukwo
    dialect.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"
"4.5.2.   Descriptive Clause
       The predicate of a descriptive clause differs from the predicate of an equative clause in that it is
  non-referential. It only qualifies and describes the subject-referent. The predicate can either be a
  nominal phrase as in an equative clause, or an adjectival phrase. The word order is inflexible - the
  result would be either unintelligible or an equative clause with different meaning. The subject is
  almost always definite and therefore marked by the demonstrative pa, or a pronoun (22c). Without
  this demonstrative the clause would look like an attributive noun phrase. Compare the following two
  examples:         (21a)   Melnum         pa          wor.
                 man            D           good
                 ‘The man      is good/well.’
         (21b)   Melnum         wor
                 man            good
                 ‘A good man’
                                                                                                         166    Other examples of descriptive clauses:
           (22a)   Namung       pa       okopma wor.
                   banana       D        food   good
                   ‘Banana is good food.’
           (22b)   Pa      melnum       manet       ur.
                   that    man          other       ID
                   ‘That is a special kind of man indeed.’           (22c)   Tingkorin    kil        melnum,         Ariyek    kil         wampung.

                   ‘Tingkorin was a man, Ariyek was a tree kangaroo.’
           (22d)   Ale     wan          akwap       pa       a      kipman.

                   ‘House-building is men’s work.’

                   this   not   car      G      take.R man            D       this   car     G   work
                   ‘This is not a bus, this is a truck!’4.6. Topic Clauses
        The notion of ‘topic’ is basically a textual notion, not a syntactic function in the clause. In Urim
    textual topics and left dislocations are a very common discourse device. Some of these sentential
    topics seem to have been lexicalized into fixed, obligatory parts of certain types of clauses. The status
    of these as basic clause types is somewhat marginal the same kind of topicalization structures also
    occur as productive discourse devices. Nevertheless, it seems that certain verbs in Urim require an
    obligatory argument, which can be called topic. Li-Thompson calls these kinds of structures ‘double-
    subject constructions’ (Li 1975: 481). The name conveys the idea that in these constructions the
    prototypical features of subject have been split into two constituents: topic and grammatical subject.
    Subject is prototypically what the clause is about and also the actor in control in transitive clauses-
    especially so in Urim (see section 6.4.4). If there is a lack of control in the situation expressed by a
    transitive clause, there are usually also some changes in the morphosyntax of the clause. One of these
    changes is to move the agent to the clause initial topic position and promote some other referent into
    the grammatical subject. In Urim culture certain types of actions are always considered to be outside
    of the control of the person involved. Emotions and sensations, as well as most sicknesses are
    expressed by verb frames requiring topic arguments. Possession is considered not fully controlled by
                                                                                                                          167
  the individual possessor, and for this reason also possessive clauses are topic clauses.9 In topic clauses
  both nominal constituents, topic and subject, precede the verb when it is present, but the verb itself
  may be omitted too.
4.6.1.     Possessive Clause
      In the possessive clause the semantic possessor occurs in topic position and the possessed item
  occurs as grammatical subject. This is thematically consistent with the normal ordering of
  information in the clause, since the referent of the possessor is usually given information, and the
  thing possessed is new information. Since there is no agreement morphology on the verb to show
  which NP is the grammatical subject, only word order and semantic content reveal it. The word order
  seems to be fixed; the topic and the subject cannot change places in the clause. One example was
  found where the subject appeared to occur between the two parts of an appositional topic noun phrase
  (23e). The possessor is usually animate, and most often human. Possessive clause may have a verb
  denoting the position of the possessed object. There are both verbal and verbless possessive clauses,
  but positive possessive clauses are more frequently verbal. The verb seems to be obligatory if there
  is another nominal constituent in the clause. Possessive clauses structurally resemble three other
  clause types: equative clauses (23b), existence clauses (23e) and locative clauses (23a).
          (23a)     Melnum        pa      hi       itna    wam.
                    man           D       sore     stand.R hand
                    ‘The man has a sore in the hand.’
          (23b)     Kil           kiin              wekg.
                    3sg           woman             two
                    ‘He has two wifes.’
          (23c)     melnum       ur     pa       wan   okipma watipmen.
                    person       ID     D        house food   plenty
                    ‘A certain man has plenty food in his house.’
                     or: ‘There is a man with plenty food in his house’
          (23d)     Kupm           wan              kalpis-en.
                    1sg            house            not-ATR
                    ‘I have no house.’
          (23e)     Kitn           nerkgiin         Klimanglen       kalpis.
                    2sg            gardenland       Klimanglen       not
                    ‘You Klimanglen have no garden land (here).’
  9 Foster (in Plank 1979) discusses the notion of possession in different cultures and how it affects the structure of
  possessive clauses.
                                                                                                                            168
      The possessive clause is negated differently from most other clause types. Instead of the usual
  negative particle ake the nominal negative word kalpis is used and there is no verb.10 Elsewhere,
  only existence clauses are negated in this way (see Section 6.3.2). There are two other features shared
  between existence clauses and possessive clauses: 1) use of the same verbs, and 2) the existence of
  verbless variants. It might be possible to derive some types of possessive clause from an existence
  clause or a locative clause by adding a topic, but the structure is fully grammaticalized and the topic is
  obligatory.
4.6.2.     Experience Clause
      The topic of an experience clause is also always animate and semantically an experiencer. The
  grammatical subject is usually either a body part, where the feeling etc. is located, or an inanimate
  referent which is the cause of the feeling or the object of wanting etc. The only common features
  such clauses exhibit are: 1) the semantic meaning of involuntary experience, and 2) the presence of an
  obligatory topic constituent before the grammatical subject. Most experience clauses have a bound
  object pronoun which is coreferential with the topic (24a), (24d), but this pronoun can be absent,
  especially if the grammatical subject is a body part of the experiencer (24b), (24c).
      The experience clauses with body parts differ structurally from genitive constructions, which are
  always of the form Npossessed + a + Ngenitive (wam a melnum ‘man’s hand’) when the possessor is
  specific (see section 3.1.4).
          (24a)     Kupm        hu         wak-opm.
                    1sg         water      ?-1sg.O
                    ‘I am thirsty.’
          (24b)     Kupm        ake        num       wakget,       kalpis.
                    1sg         not        skin      hot           not
                    ‘I do not have fever.’
          (24c)     Kupm         ok               kark(-opm).
                    1sg          mouth            afraid(-1sg.O)
                    ‘I feel nauseated’          (24d)     Kitn     yaprekg       paipm-en-tetn?
                    2sg      breath        bad-ATR-2sg.O
                    ‘Are you out of breath?’
  10 Although no instances of possessive clauses having the negative word ake have been found thus far, it remains a
  possibility that such a construction could exist. If this were to be the case, clauses negated with ake might have a slightly
  different meaning (perhaps having to do with scope of negation) than those negated with kalpis.
                                                                                                          169
       In contrast to the possessive clause, the experience clause is normally negated using the verbal
    negator ake.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"

    symmetrical around ‘now/today’. Pikekgkil ‘one day ago’ resembles the expression hikgkil ‘one
    day from now’, and kwekekg ‘two days ago’ (< kwa+pikekg ‘above yesterday’) resembles the adverb
    ‘two days from now’ kwaikg (‘above tomorrow’).",[69]
"8   The additions of extra [n] or [p] to certain forms are probably just results of emphatic pronunciation.

                     ‘There is its own group standing for welcoming the garamut drum by dancing.’    Why the genitive pronoun sometimes takes the attributive suffix -en and sometimes not needs to
be further studied. Probably the reason is pragmatic. The form with suffix -en is more emphatic. For
example, in a text dealing with a dispute about ownership of garden lands almost all of the genitive
pronouns have suffix -en because they are emphatic—i.e. ‘mine and NOT yours’. In the forms with
-en the possessor appears to be more “attributive”, not in focus and more tied to what is possessed.9
Whereas in the form without the suffix -en the genitive pronoun is more “loose” and more like a
relative pronoun. These two constructions may occur even as alternatives in the same context:                     Yangkipm waiketn a-kupm(-en) am kai                         kol-pa-ke

                     ‘My talk is true = The talk that I talk is true’ (relative clause)   The genitive pronoun forms containing /l/ are used when the possessor is focused information or
emphatic / in contrast to someone else. Such forms often have the meaning ‘one’s own’.","[45, 46]"

     In Urim compound verbs are quite common, but it is not always easy to tell whether two verbs
form a serial structure or a compound verb stem. Consider the following examples that show how a
verb phrase which is phonologically one word, can be grammatically a phrase (as we saw with nouns
in the section 1.5.1):                 kil       ak-kwap      [‘:kw:p]                    ‘he works’
                 3sg       do-work.R                 kil       ak- n -opm [‘:ktopm]        kwap          ‘he works for me’
                 3sg       do.R-TR-1sgO                            work    Some idiomatic verb phrases containing ak are pronounced as two phonological words with more
than one main stress, others as one phonological phrase with one main stress. In both cases the
phrasal idiom is a single lexeme with a single, non-compositional meaning. No objects or other
constituents can be placed in between the parts of these idioms:                 ak -won-alm-pen                  ‘to think’
                 do.R-inside-shoot-TR
                 ak -ok-la                        ‘to beg’
                 do.R-mouth-say                 tu       ak   nokg-el-opm        ‘they are laughing at me’

  causativity in Urim. Consider the following examples, which are phonologically one word but can be
  interpreted as either lexemes or grammatical structures:                      Kil      alupm      wurkapm ak -malkgu-wel           masin          pa

                      ‘We got stones and put them in the car and made it heavy’
2.12.4. Other Types of Compounds      Urim also has compound adjectives and adverbs, although they are much less common than
  compound nouns. Almost all numerals are formally compounds or complex phrases. Many personal
  pronouns, especially dual and paucal forms are compounds. All this shows that compounding is a
  very productive means of forming words in Urim.","[111, 112, 113]"
"                 The word ahi ‘where’ is used for ‘which one?’ especially if the alternatives are there to be
                 seen. Otherwise mla ‘who?’ and kuina ‘what?’ are used.",[50]
"        In addition to the forms listed above the past temporal adverb pikekg can be modified in several
    ways to indicate a more distant past. Some temporal adverbs (at least pikekg, kwekekg and hikg) can
    also be modified by the distant deictic -ai. This makes the point of time even more indefinite:

immediately before the verb, but can occasionally occur before the subject, too. If there is pake or
tike at the end of the clause, their combined meaning is emphatic and could in many cases be
translated ‘it is --- that’, ‘it is ----- who’. (There is more about the uses of am in the section 5.5.5)                   Wang al –kil -en      kul     wreren pa, tu am          wuli eng arkol nim

hep ‘first, ahead, in front of’ and katnukg ‘later, afterwards, behind’. This adverb exceptionally gets
realis-irrealis mode; irrealis form is kutnukg (In the Kukwo dialect and in western villages of the Urim
2 dialect the forms are kanukg and kunukg).","[69, 70]"

         (Here the first clause is negative and verbless. Second clause has werpm as subject and rmpa as
          predicate.)
      The existence clause often has the same thematic functions as certain left dislocations in Urim and
  the existential clause in English; it is used to introduce new items to the text. This explains also why
  the subject in this clause type can move so easily after the verb. The position after the verb is
  universally the place of new information in the clause, and in existential clauses the subject usually is
                                                                                                              158
    new information, while in other clause types it is usually given information. The following examples
    illustrate how existence clauses and left dislocation are used the same way to introduce main
    participants at the beginning of a text. They also show how difficult it is sometimes to tell the
    difference between left dislocation and existence clause.
           (9a)    Man       warim wekg pa           atom, man        pa ukwa        warim   pa     la ...

                   ‘There was a mother and a child. The mother sent the child on an errand
                    saying ...’
        The expression man warim wekg pa here is a verbless existence clause. It cannot be interpreted
    as a left dislocation because of the conjunction atom ‘then’ between it and the next clause.           (9b)    Walmamikg      yek-wekg      pa      ekg         rpma,

                   ‘There was a grandfather and grandson, then a ghost went upriver....’        The underlined part of the sentence here is interpreted as an existence clause with verb.

                   ‘There were two brothers who went to the mission station ...’
        This is a typical case of a left dislocation introducing the main participants in the story. The
    dislocation is typically set off intonationally, so that a pause occurs between it and the main clause.","[157, 158]"

4.1. Introduction and Chart of Clause Types
        The clause is the basic syntactic unit occurring between the phrase and the sentence.1 When
    describing the clauses of a language, it is important to clearly distinguish between the notions of text
    clause and basic or kernel clause. Text clauses consist of both nuclear and peripheral elements, and
    quite often some of the nuclear elements are not present in the clause if they are known from the
    textual context or environmental context or are part of the semantic content of the verb. A basic
    clause consists of nuclear elements only and is a ‘perfect’ or ‘full’ clause in the sense that it does not
    have any elided constituents and it can be understood without a text context. Generative grammar
    defines kernel clauses or sentences as being minimal in the sense that they cannot be derived from
    other clauses. This excludes passive, imperative, interrogative etc. types from basic clause types.
    (Lyons 1979, Givon 1984)
        Nuclear elements of the clause are the predicate, which is usually a verb, and its obligatory or core
    arguments. In nonverbal clauses the NP or adjective phrase functions as the predicate. In Urim a
    clause can minimally consist of only a single predicative noun phrase. Basic clauses consisting only
    of a verb are not allowed2, although this kind of text clause is very common as the result of ellipsis
    and clause chaining. All clauses can also have various types of optional adjuncts: accompaniment,
    instrument, time, location, reason, etc. In Urim the number of optional elements in a clause is usually
    restricted to at most two. The occurrence of these is semantically determined, and does not affect the
    description of the basic clause types.

    Many grammars talk about predication types instead of clause types, but we have chosen this traditional way of
    structuralist grammars to describe these basic syntactic structures of Urim. Also the ideas of dependence grammar have
    been used when describing Urim clause types.
    2 Some languages allow basic clause types without any ‘proper’ semantic or grammatical subject. For example, in
    Finnish the clause Sataa ‘It rains’ consists only of a verb without any semantic subject or subject NP on the surface,
    although the verb has third person singular Subject indexing inflection.. The corresponding clause in English has a
    semantically ‘empty’ subject it. In Urim these kinds of structures are not possible, unless the structure called here the
    time clause is interpreted as having a verb instead of a noun as the only constituent (see section 4.7).

    The following criteria have been used here to determine the basic clause types in Urim:
    -     1) How many obligatory arguments does the verb have? This is the main criterion. The
          presence or absence of a verb is often also used as the main criterion for dividing clauses
          into types. While Urim has both verbal and nonverbal clause types, there are also some
          minor types where the verb is optional or is deleted when negated. Therefore the presence
          of the verb is only used as a secondary criterion in determining Urim basic clause types.
    -     2) What are the syntactic functions (subject, object etc) and the semantic roles (agent,
          patient etc) of the arguments of the verb?
    -      3) Clause types may also have special syntactic features such as word order, negative
          form, case morphology etc. These, along with the meaning of the clause, have been used
          here only as secondary criteria in separating clause types.","[151, 152, 153]"

    resemble the numeral wraur ‘three’. The first person paucal form appears to consist of the first
    person plural exclusive pronoun plus a formative -to. 7 The paucal forms are used to refer to three to
    six individuals. This is why the term paucal has been used rather than trial. The first person plural
    inclusive form appears to be formed by adding the second person plural object clitic =epm to the first
    plural exclusive form men. The short forms ekg for the dual forms and to and teng for the paucal
    forms are used often after it has been made clear first to whom they refer. Ekg is also used to co-
    ordinate two NPs.",[39]

    The data for this paper were collected mainly between 1980 – 1995 in the village of Laningwap. The
    data includes a corpus of about 40 spoken and written texts along with some elicited material. The team

    were Robert Bugenhagen and Robert Conrad. Pirkko Luoma participated in a second grammar analysis
    seminar in 1993 and was greatly helped by her consultant Robert Bugenhagen. Paul Heinemann also
    provided many valuable suggestions and helped with the formatting of the paper.

29.   angklin               ingklin              ‘help’     From the above forms we can see that the modal vowel usually occurs in the first syllable of the
verb. However there are some exceptions: forms 17-21 and 25-27. In these verbs the realis /irrealis
vowel occurs in the second syllable of the verb. Forms 17-21 are all locative verbs. The occurrence
of the modal vowel in the last syllable could be a feature of this verb class. Locative verbs are
exceptional in other respects as well. It is harder to say why verbs 25-27 differ from other
phonetically similar verbs 28-30. One possible explanation for all those cases is phonetic. When the
first syllable of the verb ends with a nasal or liquid, even the realis vowel a gets so reduced that the
distinction of realis/irrealis would be hard to hear. Notice that the verbs with a habitual or transitive
suffix (forms 22-24) place the realis/irrealis vowel at the beginning of the same verb-stem!
     When the vowel of the second syllable is /a/, this process of reduction is even stronger - this might
explain why only some of the verbs having the consonant [] on the first syllable place the modal
vowel on the second syllable.54 Sequences of voiceless stop plus homorganic nasal release are interpreted as unit phonemes. The reversed sequences
of nasal plus homorganic stop are interpreted as consonant clusters. (See Luoma, 1985)
5 This data would seem to be an excellent candidate for an optimality theory approach (which assumes that languages
have multiple constraints interacting which are ranked as being more or less important, and the forms which have the least
weighty violations are the ones which actually occur).

     Phonetically, the irrealis vowel tends to get reduced and shortened so that it practically disappears,
especially when a verb stem begins with a nasal or liquid—i.e. a [-obst] consonant—the irrealis vowel
can the consonant coalesce, yielding a syllabic consonant. In these cases irrealis i is not written in
orthography (which follows pronunciation rather than the underlying morphemic form). Irrealis i is
sometimes pronounced (and written) [u] especially if the obstruents /k/ or /p/ precede or follow it and
if the second syllable or verb stem has u-vowel: karkuk - kurkuk ‘bathe’, nakure - nukure
‘decorate’, kaluk - kuluk ‘wash’’.","[22, 23, 24]"

    5) The demonstrative ai does not have same thematic functions than ti and pa. It is never used to
mark topicality, emphasis or focus. Occasionally ai is used to replace pa as mark of anaphoric
reference if the speaker wants to refer to the distance or direction of the referent.","[96, 97]"

Subject referent is very generic or indefinite. Indefinite reference is sometimes also expressed by zero
anaphora, if some other NP is in the topic position in the clause. Third person singular indefinite
referents are also often expressed by using the noun kamel ‘body’ (comp. old English!) at least in the
object position. The third person plural pronoun tu is also used within the noun phrase to encode
plurality of human (or at least animate) entities (see section 2. 3. 1. 1)                  Tu awi       nampro a          tu     ak     alm       melnum amo pa

instead of the near demonstrative ti, and may in this function be attached to other singular pronouns or
nouns (see also the first example above). In this function kil can refer both to animate and inanimate

demonstrative pa occurs modifying a personal pronoun, this construction has thematic function. The
demonstrative pa is used with personal pronouns to emphasize, express contrast, and mark something
as topical. This last function of pa makes it possible that in Urim texts two persons can be referred by
personal pronouns all the way through after initial introduction, even when the actor or speaker

Object Pronominal Clitics
    The Object pronominal clitics are phonologically adjoined to the verb. They conflate the non-
singular number categories of the free pronouns, distinguishing only: 1) first, second, and third
persons, and 2) singular versus non-singular numbers.","[40, 41, 42]"

5.5.5.   Temporal connectives
      In Urim temporally related clauses can be simply juxtaposed without any intervening
  conjunctions. The conjunctions wa ‘and’ and the causative pa, can mark also time relationships in
  addition to their other functions. These are described elsewhere (see. 7.5.1 and 7.5.6). The
  conjunction atom ‘then’ is more specialized to show temporal relationships between clauses. It seems
  that atom is used whenever there is temporal sequence with a relatively greater amount of
  discontinuity, due to a change in speaker, or the end of a sequence of closely related, normally co-
  occurring events, whereas juxtapposition and wa would indicate the juxtapposition of events which
  more commonly co-occur. Also certain temporal adverbs, especially am ‘now’, function as temporal
  connectives between clauses.
  The temporal conjunction atom ‘then’
      The conjunction atom indicates temporal sequence, basically expressing that the second action
  occurs relatively soon after the first action. It is especially common in narrative type of texts. In
  those types of texts it can also mark the change of speakers in conversations (here its use overlaps
  with the use of ari, see 5.5.3.): In spite of its frequency, atom is not the most frequently used
  connective between clauses denoting subsequent happenings and actions in texts. More common are
  clause-chains without any markers, and conjunctions wa ‘and’ and pa ‘ then’. In spoken texts also the
  time word am ‘now’ and tail-head linkage are quite commonly used in this function (see 5.7).
      In narrative texts atom seems to occur most often when there is a change of actor or speaker or
  some other kind of change of topic. There are some stories where atom occurs in almost every second
  clause but these kinds of stories are apparently not of the best style in Urim. The best storytellers use
  atom more sparsely.
      It looks like atom is used whenever there is temporal sequece with a relatively greater amount of
  discontinuity. The continuity can be due to a change in speaker, or the end of a sequence of closely
  related, normally co-occurring events, whereas juxtaposition and wa ‘and’ would indicate the
  juxtaposition of events which more commonly co-occur.","[215, 216]"

"      The overall order of constituents in the Urim verb is:
  verb root (Habitual-Continuative -e) (Transitive -en) (IO-marker -n) (Object Pronominal Clitic)
      In Urim a verb stem can be simple, reduplicated, compound, or consist of a root morpheme plus a
  derivational affix (sometimes more than one) (see the section 2.12.3).
2.2.1.       Realis-Irrealis Mode
  Ablaut involving the modal morphemes i ‘irrealis’ 3 and a ‘realis’ is exhibited by approximately
  two thirds of the verb stems. These vowels usually occur on the first syllable of the verb. In many
  Urim verbs the first syllable consists of this vowel only. Consider the following forms:          Realis Form           Irrealis Form         Meaning                          Canonical Form Of Root

  2 Although there is no Subject-indexing person-number inflection on the verbs, Urim does have a set of Object pronominal

2.10.1. The Place of Conjunctions
      Usually Urim conjunctions occur clause initially. Some conjunctions have two possible positions
  between clauses, either at the end of the first clause before the pause, or after the pause starting the
  second clause. This position seems to make the conjunction stronger, emphasize it, and sometimes is
  also provides slightly different meaning compared to the initial position. In speech the conjunction
  occurring clause finally usually gets prominent (high pitch - long vowel) intonation.","[103, 104]"
"     The most common and probably basic function of ur is to mark indefiniteness ‘a, one’ (in
negative clauses ‘any’). Ur is commonly used to introduce new referents to the text, but not every
time. Ur is used in the following cases:
     - when it is important to know the number of referents introduced, but the context or other
modifiers do not tell it. For this reason ur is almost always used when persons are introduced. Often
it can be glossed ‘one’ like the numeral uris, but the numeral does not have the function of
introducing new referents. Even if the numeral occurs, ur is still required to show that a new referent
is being introduced (see the first example below).",[87]
"It is also possible for the free pronouns to occur in the Object slot. Compare the following examples:                  Tu           or-opm
                  3pl          hit-1sgO

                  ‘Then I told to him:...’                  Atom kupm la naki kil pa                  la-la: ....
                  then    1sg      say tell.R 3sg D         say-say
                  ‘Then I told told to him:...’ (changing topic)    A bound pronominal Object is used when there is no need to highlight the pronoun for purposes
of contrast, emphasis, etc. The free pronoun is always used if any modifier co-occurs with the Object
pronoun. In the example immediately above, the demonstrative pronoun pa is used either for
emphasis or because the actor changes after this clause.
    What is said here applies also when a personal pronoun is used to refer to a peripheral clausal
argument (its semantic role typically being Recipient-Benefactive or Locative-Goal) . It is promoted
to core argument in the form of bound pronoun when the referent is an already activated topic that is
simply being maintained. All uses of the bound Object pronouns are thematically unmarked ‘normal’
uses. The use of a free pronoun in this position indicates extra prominence or emphasis on the referent
(for more examples see Section 2.2.4).
    The object pronominal clitics also occur as the result of a syntactic process of possessor
ascension, which lifts the possessor of an inalienable noun (usually a body part) out of the noun
phrase to serve as the Object of the verb. It is possible to have both the Object clitic and a co-
referential genitive pronoun if the possessor referent is especially emphasized or in focus, as in the
second example below:
                                                                                                    44                 Drapuk      al    -opm           hi

                 3sg      hit    stand.R-1sgO            eye
                 ‘He hit me in the eye’    When the verb and body part form a lexical unit, the Object pronominal clitic is obligatory. This
might be the origin of the use of suffix -el in idioms and lexemes as adverbializer. Compare
especially the two first examples below:                 Kitn aro -wopm won ok                anong-en        Urim

Genitive Pronouns
    The genitive pronouns exhibit the same person, number, and exclusive-inclusive distinctions as
the independent pronouns, being formed by phonologically adjoining the relative clause
complementizer a to a following independent pronoun. In essence, then, genitives in Urim are
formally a kind of minimal relative clause: pig that (is) I/mine = my pig.
    In addition, one or both of the following two modifications to the pronominal forms are possible:
1) the attributive suffix -en may be added to them, and 2) an /l/ may be added between the relative
clause complementizer a and the independent pronominal form. Thus, there are four possible forms
for each genitive pronoun. 8Person      Singular                 Dual                      Paucal     Plural

The verb elng ’put’ occurs in a serialized construction expressing voluntary actions directed to a
location.
                  kirmpa      elng    kinar        elng   kaino..
                  plane       put     go.down      put    go.up

                  ‘Vomit into this paper bag!’
Permissive modality expressed by the verb kai ‘go’ in serialized constructions
                  Kai kitn            kaino      o!
                  go    2sg           go.down    IMP

                  ‘Let the dead men bury themselves!’
Completive aspect expressed by a serial verb construction with plalng ‘finish’
   Unlike the preceding verbs, the verb plalng ‘to finish’ occurs following the clause it semantically
modifies when expressing completive aspect:
                  al             plalng
                  eat.R          finish
                  ‘ate (it) all’               Contrast this with the following example, where the sentence final perfect aspect
               adverb ise occurs.
                 Hu            pa      wakget ise
                 water         D       hot       PERF
                 ‘The water is hot (has boiled)’
   In the following cases as well, the serial verb marking modality or aspect occurs after the clause it
semantically modifies. This order helps to differentiate the aspectual meaning of the verb from other
meanings.
Conative modality expressed with ari ‘see’
     Conative modality—attempting to do something—is expressed using the verb ari (irrealis form
iri)‘to see’.
                 Ti      kipm     ik-won-ilmpen        iri!
                 C       2pl      do.IR-inside-stir.IR see.IR
                 ‘So you think about it!’

                  ‘lets try to open this door!’
Continuative aspect expressed with locative verbs (itna ‘stand’, rpma ‘sit’, rmpa ‘lie’,rka ‘hang’,
       ela ‘be situated’, ha ‘be, stay’)
                  Kil         atn-en         itna

                  what 3pl hide.R-1plO          lie.R    go.into     house small

                  ‘You are not coming on with the weeding?’ But no, she was just sitting still in one spot
                  there’
Durative aspect expressed via repetition of verbs
    Especially in spoken texts, verbs can be repeated several times at the end of clauses expressing
durative aspect; i.e. the action continues for an extended period of time. This repetition of verb seems
to never occur at the end of a sentence, only between clauses. Sometimes the adverbs ninan or titan
are used in addition or instead of the repetition of verb. Rising intonation always occurs with these
devices. Written texts do not exhibit this repetition of verbs to express durative aspect, whereas ninan
and titan do occur in written texts.","[200, 201, 202]"

                  (Notice, that while in English a demonstrative can occur by itself to encode a
                  Subject argument, in Urim the word kweikwei ‘thing’ is added, because pa does not
                  usually occur by itself in the Subject position)                  Man warim         aser      mi, pa         man    pa       aser   hep,

                  ‘Kinyom’s breasts were good, Kinepan had swollen breasts.’
                  (pa marks contrast here. With proper names it would be unnecessary to mark
                  definiteness)                  Atom kupm         la       naki kil pa lala ... Atom kil           lala ...

                  (pa is used here to mark a topic change rather than givenness, because the personal
                  pronouns already indicate given referents.)
    The combination ur pa has special uses introducing new topics into a discourse (see section
4.7.2.1). In some cases pa is used without ur in the same introducing function despite the fact that the
referent is being mentioned for the first time and cannot be known to the hearer. In this function both
deictic and definite meanings have become bleached and the sole function of pa is to indicate the
introduction of a topic:                  Warim kiin           ur pa kaino rmpa          kaino    Untun-ai

      The position of pa (and other demonstratives) in the noun phrase is after quantifiers and before
  the indefinite pronoun ur. Exceptionally pa may occur before qualifier or quantifier. In these cases
  the function of pa is to emphasize the modifier instead of whole NP:                    Irmpen-topm hapm             siket       pa          watipmen!

                    ‘My child, build a big house!’
2.9.2.   The Near Demonstrative ti
     The demonstrative pronoun ti ‘this, here’ always signals proximity to the speaker or hearer.
  When ti occurs in texts, the nearness can also be psychological. This demonstrative pronoun can
  have almost same discourse functions as pa has (givenness, contrast etc.) but concrete or
  psychological meaning of nearness is always present in all uses (see the paper ‘The Demonstrative
  Pronouns pa and ti in Urim Discourse). Ti is also used as conjunction (see section 5.5.6).","[91, 92, 93]"

                  ‘She took the pot from fire.’    In addition to this analytic construction expressing Source, there are a number of compound verb
stems expressing separation from some locative source which appears to begin with a bound verbal
form ang-/ing- (these forms come from the realis -irrealis forms a-i ‘be’). These are listed below:     angkark                ‘flee’                      (from kark ‘afraid’)
     angkli                 ‘throw away                 (from kli ‘husk’)
     angklon                ‘be forbidden. separated from’

                 ‘He fell from a tree.’
Comitative Serializations
    Serialized constructions with the verbal preposition nampokgen ‘accompany’ are used to express
comitative notions. This word is fully grammaticalized to a preposition and is not used as a verb
anymore, but has retained realis-irrealis form. Its original meaning is not known and especially the
young people do not seem to connect the different realis and irrealis forms with mode, but use them
inconsistently. There are several freely alternating or dialect dependent forms of the word:
nampokgen (IR nimpokgen) and nampikgen (IR nimpikgen) in Urim 1 sub dialect, nampon (IR
nimpon) and nampiin(en) (IR nimpiin(en)) in sub dialect 2 and in Kukwo dialect. These can be used
when the accompanying party is either human or non human.
    Serialized constructions with the verb anti (IR inti) ‘agree, comply with’ are only used if the
accompanying party is human. The verb ngkaten (IR ngkiten) ‘lift up with, carry with’ is used in
constructions expressing accompaniment when the object is actually physically carried.","[55, 56]"

5.4.2.      Serial structures and lexicalization
         A number of compound verbs in Urim seem to be derived from serial verb constructions.
                  ari la (see-say)                           ‘judge, decide
                  arkol aye kul (move-carry-come)            ‘pull’
                  arkol aye kai (move-carry-go)              ‘push’                  ak-ikg-la (do-look-say)                    ‘spy’

  5.4.3.   Examples of complex serial structures:
        In Urim it is possible to have multiple serial verb constructions with different functions
    juxtaposed. Consider the following examples:                      kil      kintir-kuntur no         ang -kai              ya      ha         ti

                      ‘He is just coming rushing down the road’                      (kintirkuntur no - a serial verb construction consisting of onomatopoeiic verb plus a
                      motion verb
                      angkai ya ha ti - source phrase)                      kuina tu lam-to               rmpa     kawor       wan wusok?
                      what 3pl hide.R-1plO          lie.R    go.into     house small
                      ‘What are they hiding from us in the small house?’                      (rmpa functions as an aspect marker while the motion verb kawor expresses a locative semantic
                      role)                      manto     harng       kai la       nam                    kamel

                      ‘The pig went rushing intending to bite the man’                      mentepm no           karkuk        rpma kainar minip wenting

                      ‘We came upriver and stopped to bath down in the place where the rivers separated’
                      (kainar refers to the location of the bathing place - they had to go down to it)                      tu      anele       pisurpusur     elng      kinar         hu
                      3pl     in.group splash            put       go.down       water
                      ‘They all dropped themselves splashing into the water’ (intentionally)
                      (This clause has two verbal aspect markers, anele ‘one by one’ and elng ‘voluntary’, and one
                      onomatopoetic verb functioning as manner adverbial)5.5. Urim conjunctions
        It is difficult to motivate a coordinating versus subordinating distinction for many of the
    conjunctions. Therefore conjunctions are described here simply on a semantic basis according to the
    type(s) of relationship they express. As is the case in many languages, some of the most common
    Urim conjunctions seem to be morphologically composed of deictic forms. These are pa, ti, pake,
    pipa and their combinations The deictic form pa has an especially wide range of conjunctive
    functions. Some prepositions and time words (like a, eng, ak, am) play a role in connecting sentences,
    as do a few verbs as well (e.g. la).

5.5.1.   Additive conjunction (w)a
      The additive conjunction (w)a ’and’ links clauses and sentences expressing propositions that are
  only loosely related, where neither a temporal or causal relationship is particularly evident.i
      Often the clause marked by wa adds further information that is similar in nature to that of the first
  clause (‘and also’).","[205, 206, 207, 208]"
