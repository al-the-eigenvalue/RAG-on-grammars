A division into non-mood forms and mood forms does not occur here.
I did find a number of informal forms: these, however, do' not form
a complete paradigm. I n addition, I found in the texts a few cases of
informal interrogative forms characterized by the suffix -an. My in-
formants, however, always used a construction with the question
marker en/an in interrogative sentences,('Paradigms:    see p. 112)The verb e / j -to do, when- linked with a form of category 3 (core-&),

"4 The m'/mV- category110
m- is prefixed to cores beginning with a vowel ;
mV- is prefixed to cores with initial consonant. The vowel of the
prefix is identical to the first vowel of the core, but it can also be a
irrespective of the following vowel. A definite regularity could not be
found here ; sometimes both possibilities were found alongside each
other, sometimes only one of them, for instance, I noted:
    from f o r 'to see' : xa6-por and md-for;
    from fis 'to come inside' : always mi-fis ;
    from ni 'to return home7: always md-n-i.
Cores with prefixed m-/mV- have a semantic element of intent which
is translatable with :1. to wish to, in order to, to intend to :

I obtained, in addition, m-/mV- forms from my informants every time
they referred to the action or the happening as such ; for example, when
I asked them ""What's 'to goy"", they replied ""ma-jdr"". ""What's 'to
take' ?"" - ""mi-tew6r"".
The question is, how do these forms stand as regards the core which
can also indicate an action or a happening as such? It is out of the
question that this is an idiosyncracy of my informants, for Drabbe 9
had the same experience with his informants from Ajam.10 It occurs
to me that these forms only differ from the affixless core in having
a semantic element of explanation, or clarification. This idea is sup-
ported by the fact that in categories 12, 14, 16 and 17, forms also
occur that are characterized by a prefix m-/mV- which seems to differ   loan-word from Malay.

lo Drabbe does not say this explicitly. That he had the same experience, how-
   ever, appears from his treatment of the m/mV-fwms: see 5 47 of his ""Gram-

"12 The habitual category13s
This category, like categories 13 to 15, inclusive, and 18 to 21, inclusive,
is a tense-aspect category with separate characteristics of form for
indicating time and aspect. In this category, as in the two previous
categories, a series of formal and a series of informal forms occur.
These two series are, in addition, opposed to a third series of forms
which express a particular mood of the speaker, such as, for example :
joy, excitement, vexation, disappointment. These forms I shall call
mood forms. The formal and the informal forms are, in this respect,
neutral. I n addition, a few interrogative forms were noted. These occur
only in the traditional stories. I get the impression that they have an
archaic character. Outside the traditional tales, I found in questions only
the non-interrogative forms, followed by the question marker en/an.17136

"V ADJECTIVESCharacteristics199
Words from which derivatives can be formed with the following suffixes
will here be termed adjectives :
Since, as far as morphological valence is concerned, there is a distinct
similarity to the substantives, it is legitimate to. ask the question whether
there is here a separate class of adjectives. There are three arguments
which plead for the existence of a special class :
1. the semantic value of -nakdp and -nakds differs clearly from the
   semantic value which these suffixes have when they are added to
   a substantive;
138                        THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
2. the po~~sibility
                 of suffixing -Mi,a productive process', that does
   not occur with the substantives;
3. the word jiwina-kdp occurs as a derivative substantive with the
   meaning of 'small child' (see 5 191), and as an adjective, with
   the meaning of 'small'. I t is po'ssible here to' conclude that this is
   a case of transposition, a conclusion strengthened by the fact that
   from jiwmakd-p 'small*,derivatives can be formed with -nakdp(iriw)
   and -pidm (see $ 204).","[149, 150]"
"817The derivatives with -m are :
      nam   (1st. pas!. sing. & pi.)
      om    (2nd. pen. sing.)
      cam   (2nd. pers. pi.)
      am    (3rd. pers. sing. & pi.)
Unlike the orther derivatives, it is impossible in these cases to decide
which variant is the underlying form. Is -m suffixed to the A variant
or does it replace the r of the B variant ? Furthermore, here both no)nor
and nu/nar have a derivative nam.
The semantic element common to these derivatives can be translated
by: also, concerning; often it can only be circumscribed as slight
emphasis oln the person or persons in question.
      ndma! I, too!
      nam asen a k a e m h d     I lie in a good place, I do! (8 314).

5 The Flamingo Bay dialect: area, history   The Flamingo Bay dialect is spoken by about 2,600 people who
live in five villages, Ewer, Surii, Jepkm, Per and Uwhs,9 situated in
the immediate vicinity of flamingo^ Bay. In the literature on Asniat,
this group of villages is also called BismAni, but the people themselves
apply this name only to the villages of Ewer and Surt?, of which the
inhabitants formerly lived together.
   The oral historical tradition of these villages goes back about a
century. About the middle of the 19th century, Ewer, Sure, Uwhs,
and the village of Majit, stood together on the River Mow: Uwus
is still there (see map). Jepkm and Per, situated on the Jom6t and
the M a d , respectively, were then on the upper reaches of these small
streams, with, at that time, the village of Kajk standing beside Per.
Later on, Majit affiliated with Surii, while Kajk ceased to exist,  According to the data furnished by the Medical Service for 1961, published
  in V. F. P. M. van Amelsvoort's thesis (see note 9, p. 192, the population of
  these villages at that time was :
                                  Ewer . . . . 686
                                  Sum  ....       697

6                             THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
because its inhabitants dispersed to different villages after the death
in battle of their foremost warrior.10 Some of the Kaj6 people went
to live at Surh. The inhabitants of Ewer and Suru left the Mow
and, after wandering about for some time, settled in their present
dwelling place.
   The language of the villages around Flamingo Bay exhibit small
lexical variations as between one village and another. Within Suru,
the descendants of the people from Kaje are distinguished from the
'true' people of Surh by some lexical peculiarities in their speech.
These singularities are regarded by the non-Kajk people as typical
of the latter. Nothing comparable concerning the people from Majit
came to my attention.116 Work with informants  The collaboration of two boys from Suru who were in the third
and highest class at the Roman Catholic Mission school, was arranged
with the help of the Mission. These boys were about 13 years old
and appeared to be fairly intelligent. One of them, Mifekpic, was the
principal informant throughout the entire investigation. The other,
Natinak, worked with me for over a year.
   Mifekpic, baptised Andreas, was a grandson of Warskkomen, the
oldest of the chiefs of Sur6 and the most influential man in the
Flamingo Bay area. Through his grandfather, Mifekpic was descended
from the people of Kajk. Natinak, baptised Natalis, was related on
his mother's side to the people of Amor&p, a village belonging to the
Aj5-m dialect-area. Both boys also had relatives in the village of Jepkm,    I was told in JepCm that, on the death of the most important fe.w~xiji$ic,
   warrior, it was formerly the usual practice for the group to break up, and
   for the people in it to seek affiliation with other groups ('villages').
11 Asmat villages are not closed communities as far as language is concerned.
   Formerly, there was a regular influx of people speaking other dialects con-
   sequent upon the practice of abducting women and children during headhunting
   raids; by the adoption of children at the peace ceremony; and by people
   affiliating with other villages (see note 9). At the present time, it is especially
   the family connections with other villages (probably as a result of the historical
   facts above mentioned) which provide the contact with people speaking different
   dialects. In Jepkn~,I know of family connections with four villages in another
   dialect-area, namely, Ac, Amiinamkaj, Miwar and Om&nesep.
   Although the Asmat people who speak one dialect regard anyone speaking
   another dialect as fasi (crooked, wrong), no similar judgement regarding the
   small language differences within the village community ever has come to
   my attention.
                                INTRODUCTION                          7where the investigation was later to be carried on. Mifekpic had even
spent part of his childhood there.
   My relationship to the two boys developed from the outset on the
'anak piara' 12 pattern: they called me their 'father' and were regarded
as my 'children'. They were paid in cash for their assistance. They
were given a meal every day, and now and then some clothes and
tobacco. With their wages they could buy clothes, tobacco, and the
highly prized axes and chopping knives at the shop in Agats. The
relationship with these informants was a very good and personal one
throughout the whole undertaking. They worked with enthusiasm and
pleasure, apart from some unavoidable lapses.
   Because the boys were still rather young, their knowledge of their
mother tongue, of tradition and of mythology was sometimes inadequate
for the translating of the folk tales I collected. The help of an older
man was then enlisted for the interpretation of mythological matters
and special usage. In addition, all the Asinat people with whom I con-
versed acted as informants. The information received from them was
always checked again with the regular informants.
   The reason I chose two of the latter was primarily to enable me to
control the information given by the one by that provided by the other
and vice versa. Another reason was that the boys' capacity for work
was rather small, especially in the beginning - an hour at a stretch
was more than enough for them. Later, when they had been properly
trained, they could sustain a session of two hours or longer without
difficulty. No fixed scheme of questioning was followed at these
sessions. The discussion began on a particular subject and developed
as it went along, depending upon the mood of the informant. The boys
were never prevented from giving information spontaneously, even if
it were not relevant, but sometimes they had to be guided along a fresh
track back to the original subiect. If it became apparent that an answer
to a question about a particular matter was not forthcoming readily,
either because the boy did not understand me, or because he had had
enough, then it was put on one side. Later, a casual return to it often
produced good results. If one of them gave information on a subject
and it differed from that which the other had furnished, then these
variations were discussed in the presence of both of them. And some-
times it then became clear that they held differing opinions regarding
the pronunciation of particular wolrds, or their meaning.","[17, 18, 19]"

'Tewir, make a carrying bag"" he said. Each night he disappeared into
the forest. There was only one goodly young' sago palm; it stood there
with broad-based fronds. There was only the ordinary forest by the
 Sir&. There were no sago palms; there was no sago' forest. The man
got to work; he made an open space. He pulled off the old fronds
 from the young palm. Time and again he looked at it: ''You're a
beauty !"" I t rose up like lime which is thrown about."" Finally it grew
into a wux6~;(then) it became a copon. * The man stood guard by it.
At last it had grown large and high. He told his wife to make a bag,
a bag plaited with the fibres from the roots of the pandan tree. The man
got the roots ; he stripped off a great quantity of roots and put them
down together for his wife, ""Tewer, I've just stripped off a great
amount of pandan roots t o make the bag with; d r y them, put them in
the sun to dry quickly!"" he said. ""All right,"" said his wife, and she
spread out the roots in the sun; she laid them down neatly in the sun.
""Now, plait the bag; are the roots dry yet?"" ""Yes, they were already
quite dry yesterday; they were already quite dry the day before yester-
day."" ""Fine, start the plaiting, work loose the fibres,"" he said. Now,
the sago palm had grown into a fully grown palm. A large fully grown

the bag, if you plait continually it '11 be made in a day."" But his wife
said: ""Huh, a carrying bag can't be plaited in a day! A bag made of
grass, yes, that can be plaited in a day, but a fibre bag, even if the
plaiting is done without interruption, that can't be done! You don't
really mean that,"" she said.",[219]

1 The Asmat language: area, adjacent languages, dialects   The language of the Asmat Papuans, Asmat,l is one of a number
of related Papuan languages which are spoken over an extensive area
of the coastal plain of South-West New Guinea (Irian Barat). These
languages extend along the coast from the River Opa in the nolrth-west
to the mouth of the River Digul in the south-east.2
   The Asmat region is generally considered to be the coastal strip
and the adjacent hinterland between the Rivers Momkc (Le Cocq
d'Armandville) and Ewtii. In addition to his region, however, Asmat
is also spoken in a small area to the east of the confluence of the Rivers
Sirkc (Eilanden) and Wildeman; on the coastal strip between the
Ewtk and Cook Bay (the Casuarinen Coast) ; and in a few villages
on the coast between Cook Bay and the mouth of the River Digul.
   I t is still not known with certainty how far inland the Asmat
language-area extends. I t was only recently that this coastal area was
brought under Government control and that part of the low-lying
plain abutting onto the mountainous country in the centre is still
practically terra incognita. Up to now, Asmat villages have been
encountered inland to a distance of more than 70 miles.
   To the north-west of the Asmat language-area, two languages relatedIntroductory note

                           THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
to Asmat, KAn~oroand Skmpan, are spoken. These two languages
cover the whole coastal area between the Rivers Opa and Otakwa.
Between the Otakwa and the MomAc, where the Asmat language-area
begins, there are no villages. Nothing is known about the languages
to the north and the north-east of the Asmat language-area : in the east
and the south-east, Asmat meets up with the Awju and Jakaj languages,
which are probably not related to Asmat.3
   Asmat has various dialects, but a systematic investigation into them
has not yet been made, so that little is known about the nature and
extent of the dialectical variations. Broadly, Asmat dialects can be
divided into a central group of little differing dialects with, around it,
on the periphery of the Asmat language-area, a number of dialects
differing sharply from it: those spoken upstream of the Rivers Pomiic
(Noordwest), Unir (Lorentz) and Sirkc, and the dialect of the
Casuarinen Coast.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

followed or preceded by a non-hornorgan nasal.21
/p/      Allophones : [PI, [ z l , [pW1
      1. [p] occurs in all positions: [ep] tail; [pa] scale; [up'u] coconut
      shell; [upt'om] having ; [kanp'or] kind of crab.
      2. [n} alternates with [p], it would seem, only in the sequence
      /VpVpV/ [bandajimb'uE] open it !
      3. [pw] this allophone, it seems, is used only by older people. It
      could not be established whether it is a social characteristic, for
      instance, a sign of status. It occurs only before the vowel / e / . This
      allophone did not occur in the speech of the regular informants.
       [pwq-]name of a village; [pw8] crab.22
/t/     [t] . No allophones.
      [tern] rattan; [b6tt6] gaba-gaba; [pit] python; [tatm'a] nonsense;
      [ojt'ur] having a high degree of a particular quality.23
/c/     Allophones: [C], [t7].
      1. [ti] occurs in all positions, except as the first consonant of a
      cluster ($ 51) : [tern] house ; [pot^ak] bad ; [apt'um] having,
      supplied with ; [ut] iguana.
      2. [ty] was found alternating with [ E l in final position in the
      following cases: [i?, ity] thorn ; [fie, fity] nail.24
/k/     Allophones: [k], [XI.
      1. [k] occurs in all positions: [kap] armpit; [ak'ot] good;
      [akm'at] old ; [esk'am] red; [pok] goods.
      2. [x] as an altemant of [k] was found only in a few cases; in
18                          THE ASMAT LANGUAGE      the cases noted, [x] always follows a vowel : [akrn'ot, axdat] old ;
       [atak'am, atax'am] story ; [qp'ak, op'ax] not.25
/f/     [f] . No allophones.
      [fi] empty; [uf'u] kind of shell fish; [of] rotten ; [afc'in] the crust
      of roasted sago ; [bafokfiw] to go downstream into (a house).26
/s/     Allophones: [s], ['I, [S], [@I.
      1. [s] occurs in all positions: [si] stone axe; [Cs'Ci] bag', [ssp'et]
      shoot of the sago palm ; [dems'hiikap] slow; [os] tree.
      2. ['I alternates with [s] in normal speech, i.e., speech that is
      neither deliberately slow nolr intentionally emphatic. I n the cases
      noted, ['I always occurs after a vowel. The phonetic quality of this
      allophone is difficult to define by ear. I found it markedly similar
      to a voiceless glottal fricative [h], When, however, I deliberately
      pronounced an [h] in such cases, my informants thought it ridi-
      culous. I t is probably a weak alveolar fricative. Regrettably, I have
      not been succcessf~ilin reproducing this allophone : [amb'as, ambfas]
      sago ; [des'cn, W e n ] none.
      3. [.%I and [i?] occur especially in the speech of older people.
      I got the impression that they are not alternants of [s], but that
       [El and [ 8 ] are distributed throughout the vocabulary in a way
      which varies from person to person.27
/r/      Allophones : [TI,[r].
      1. [r] occurs in all positions except in initial position and as the
      last consonant of a cluster (5 48, 53) : [tEr'E] rattan leaf; [arpfuk]
      far away ; [ir] year bird.
      2. [r] Y, [g] was found only in the speech of small children and
      in the speech of the regular informants. I t is not beyond question
      that a consequence of the latter regularly speaking Malay with [TI,
      is their using it now and then in their mother tongue.28
/w/      [w] . No allophones.
      [wu] edible top of the sago palm; [juwfur] clw [ow] crocodile;
      [iwn'im] the water's edge ; [k'orwan] dagger made from a croco-

       [juw'ur ] dog ; [niWi] father.29
/ j/      Allophones : [j 1, [j] , [;I .
        1. [ j ] occurs in all positions : [jqf] hole ; [&jfam] name of a
       village ; [baj ] foot ; [ajk'un] younger brother ; [b&t'amj&n] name
       of a woman.
       2. [j] and [j] alternate with [j] in initial position: [j'qpa~es,
       jf?pa~&s,  j'opsres] sweat; [jiw'i, J'iw'i, jiw'i] child; [jo, j&] river.30
/rn, n/ These are two complex phonemes which present an almost
   complete parallel. Both phonemes have as allophones a voiced stop,
   its honiorgan nasal, and a combination of both ; nasal     stop:+
          ^m/ = [blJ [ml [mbl 2
          /n/ = [dl, [nl, [ndl
    1. The voiced stop 4 occurs in initial position, and as second
   member of the clusters /nm, mn/ ; in the latter case only if no
   nasal follows : [b] : [bi] nose ; [besn'im] smell ; [cop'inbi] land ;
    [dl : [det] ghost; [dsw%t] brother; [amd'u] towards each other.
   2. The nmal occurs in all other cases, and, in addition, in initial
   position before a following nasal, and also as second member of
   the clusters /nm, mn/, if no' nasal follows. In these last cases, the
   stop and the nasal thus alternate: [in] : [m'irnkani, b'irnkam] kind
   of liana; [m'antum, brantam] on the lookout; [am'an] bow;
    [ j ims'ip] door ; [manm'ak, munb'uk] eye ; [jokm'en] having super-

   3. I n the following cases, the nasal and the combination nasal             +
   voiced homorgan stop, alternate :

      group in S u r k The locale of the story is the Sepkr, a sidestream
      of the Sir& (see map 11). In the past, the people of Majit lived
      for some time on the Seper.
VI.   ($Â 280 - 302). Narrator: L4sd$ar, the mother of my informant,
      Nafinb/z. This story is about the origin of sago - the only stolry
      told by a woman. It differs in various details from the story of
      the origin of sago told to me later by Warsdkowien, the chief of
      the ceremonial house A r in Sum. Because this is the origin
      myth of the most important food of the Asmat people, I shall
      give a short summary of both versions :
      In A s w r ' s version, Miwirpic wants to marry the younger sister
      of his wife, Tewerawtic. When the girl expresses her nmvilling-
      ness to' become his wife, he takes the two. women with him to
      the upper course of the Sirec. There he finds a sago palm which
      he looks after until the sago1 can be extracted. In the meantime,
      he gets Tewkrawuc to1 make a huge bag. H e chops down the
      sago palm and instructs the women in the extraction of the sago.
      While he' is on his way home with the heavy bag full of sago on
      his back he sinks into a morass, still bearing the bag. During- the
      night he changes into a sago palm which makes the sago palms,
      scattering them everywhere. I t has, however, 110 crown. On the
      following day the women return to look for him. Tew6rawuc puts
      her sister upside down on Miwirpic and she changes into the
      crown of the sago palm, her legs and arms, sticking up towards
      the sky, become its fronds. Tewerawuc then returns alone to her
      village and introduces the sago to' the people.
      In W d k o m e n ' s version, Miwirpic goes alone to look for sago.
      He threads on a thorn which he then plants. From it grows the
      first sago palm. Helped by his wife, he then extracts the sago.
      On his way bade, he and the bag full of sago' sink into a morass.
      At night he changes into a sago palm which scatters its fruit
      everywhere and so spreads the sago palm.
      Warsekornen told me that he did not know the version given
      by Asepar and claimed that it was incorrect. The question arises
      in this connection, whether Asepar's version may be tolld only
      by women. Unfortunately I was not aware of this during' the
      time I was staying with the Asmat people. It is noteworthy that
      various procedure's in the kaware feast held on the Mimika Coast,
      bear a strong resemblance to some of the events described in
                                    TEXTS                                   183     Askpar's version. 1
VII. VIII. & IX. Narrator: Wow&&, a young man from Jepkim,
     approximately 16 years o'f age. These three stories all have as
     their subject matter a contact with supernatural being's. These
     were told to me as true happenings.
     I n VII. ($$ 303 - 306), he tells about the woman, Pajbmpari,
     and the consequences following intercourse with a spirit from a
     river which passes itself off as the man she desires.
     In VIII. (@ 307 - 315), Worninen tells how he himself was
     taken off by a spirit girl who wanted to marry him, and was
     finally brought back.
     I n IX. ( 5 % 316- 320), he tells how his father once had an
     encounter with his ancestors when he was searching for fish.
X.   ($8 321 - 344). Narrator : Simni, chief of the ceremonial house
     Aw6r in Surii; approximately 55 years of age. This story tells
     about a famine in the coastal regions which made it necessary
     for the people living in the area to join villages further inland.
     It describes in detail the fate of the people of J e p h when they
     went to the village of Serkw, and how the majority of them were
     slain there. The story is a tari atakdm, a story regarded by the
     Asmat people as historical. The happenings describ8ed in this
     story must have taken place at least a cen-tury ago.2
  The only description of the kaware feast known to me is in the unpublished
  notes of the Dutch Roman Catholic missionary, Father G. Zegwaard, M.S.C.,
  which date from 1952. Father Zegwaard associates this feast with two origin
  myths of which the Asmat equivalents are the stories of Fimiriw, and
  Tonjenap and Mujenap. The first story tells of the origin of mankind, the
  second, of a number of plants. In my opinion, various parts of the kaulare
  feast clearly relate to happenings in the myth, told by Asipar, i.e.,
    the plaiting of a very large basket, followed by the young men carrying very
  heavy objects ;
    the ritual chopping down of the tree of which the trunk is to provide the
  central pole of the house of the feast. When the tree is to be chopped down,
  the crown foliage is first stripped off and then a man climbs to the top. Here
  he is cliscovered by women who are out looking for him. He spits chewed
  leaves onto those below ( = sago fruit ?);
    the ritual banging end-to-end of the broad ends (called the 'heads') of two
  poles. This could be a re-enactment of the young TewGrawuc being placed,
  head-to-head, on Miwirpic.
    In view of the preceding, the Kkmoro word k m a r e could be connected
  with the Asmat word coworb, the extreme end of a frond of the sago palm.
  This view is supported by the fact that Kkmoro words often have k where
  the Asmat words, corresponding to them, have c,
2 From Zegwaard's data, it appears that four generations ago ( * 100 years)
  the villages of Surii, Ewer, J'epkrn, Per, and UwGs were in the same places
  as described in this story.

 The following day, just as the sun had risen, the man took his bow
 and went intol the forest. He looked at it: there it stood, looking as
usual, like a huge cloud of ashes ! "" ""Ho, my most beautiful one! Many
times shall I return home, filling the house (with your sago)"". The
 wife was busy from early morning, continually at it, and finally she
finished the huge thing. When she'd completed the top, she fastened
the headband to it. From one side to the other the bag was enormous.
 H e went to the forest -to look at the sago palm and when lie returned
he shot a large sow, with a heavy arrow. I t was though he'd killed a
tamed sow."" Immediately he took it to the house and laid it on the
ground. ""Tewer, are you there?"" ""Yes, I'm here."" ""This large sow,
I've shot it with an. arrow."" ""Ah, plenty to eat"", she said. ""Have you
dome the bag?"" ""Yes, the huge thing hangs up there. I've already
fixed the large headband to it."" ""Fine, decorate the bag with red and
white,"" he said. She put stripes of red ochre on it, she put the jirik
design on it ;"" and white lime. It hung there, a fine sight. He cut up
the sow and took it inside. To her sister she said: ""Come, turn your-
self round (towards the fire), my husband 's killed a large sow. You
must roast the entrails of the sow."" ""Oh, it's your sow, your husband
killed it for you, so you eat it yourself,"" she said. ""I want the jaw of
the   me;and the back part,"" he said, ""the head is for my little wife, and
a foreleg and a hisndleg"". ""Go on, put it down for her,"" she said. H e
put them down for her, a hindleg, a foreleg and the head. H e put
everything together for her, but to1 no1 purpose. Her sister nagged her,

I l l THE ACCENTIntroduction39
  To the most recent investigations in the field of accent belong the
studies of the American linguist D. L. Bolinger. In 1958, the results
of a number of experiments he had made were published.8 These
showed that the most important cue in determining stress in English
is what he terms 'prominence of pitch', i.e. ""a rapid and relatively  I owe this term to: K L. Pike, Phonetics, University of Michigan, Ann
  Arbor, 1958, p. 93.

  pp. 109-149.

wide departure from a smooth or undulating contour"".g By 'departure'
Bolinger means a deviation in a contour which then continues in the
                                                                      - or
same pitch - ' -           or - -, as well as a sudden rise -
fall - , after which it continues on a higher or a lower level.
   w i t h r e g a r d to Asrnat, it could be established that in most cases
the accent is accompanied by a clear and sudden rise or fall of the
pitch. Four cases can be distinguished :1. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the rest of the contour:2. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour preceding it :3. The accented vowel has a lower tone than the contour preceding it:
                                       -
                                           --
4. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour following it:
     It is clear that in 3, and 4 'pitch' alone does not determine the
accent. There must be other factors that cause the difference. Bolinger,
who describes a parallel case in English, attributes the determination
of accent in this case to different factors: context, phonetic reduction,
and contiguous 'unaccentables3.10 It is not possible, however, for me
to determine in how far similar factors are also active in Asmat This
would require special investigation.
  There are also cases in which I noted accent without being able
to discern a deviation in the pitch by ear. In some of these cases it
could be established that the accented vowel was rather longer than
the contiguous non-accented vowels. It was often not possible, however,
to determine by ear what the accent-determining factors were.3-1 9   Id. p. 112.
^ Id. pp. 136, 137.
1-1 I n the  above mentioned article, Bolinger remarks that psychological factors
     play a role in the interpretation of phonetic data as accent: data interpretable
     as accent may be ignored by a person speaking his mother tongue, when they
     occur in places where he knows from experience that there is no accent.
     (p. 136, 137). This presents the possibility that, on the one hand, a linguist

The general principle of accentuation
40
   The general principle of accentuation is : there is a reqular alternation
of accented and unaccented vowels.
   I n certain cases, however, sequences of two, at most three, un-
accented vowels occur.
   Furthermore, there are some cases of multi-vowelled onomatopoeia
in which no alternation of accented and unaccented vowels is found:
     iriririri   imitating"" the sound produced by many small objects
                 falling down.
     M s E       imitating the hissing of fire as it is put out.12
   The factors which co-operate to produce the accent pattern of a
word are : the morphological structure of the word, and the accents
of contiguous words in the context.","[35, 36, 37]"

 But they didn't go to the sea in the canoes. They went to the Napu
 and lined them up [the canoes against the bank]; screeching like fik
 birds, they lined them up. They lined them up by the Nap& ""What'll we

 Wbksimit then set out on foot, in the forest, and came towards him.
 He looked [about him] and there he saw father, standing there. ""Hey,
people,"" - no, when he saw him, he said: I t Hey, someone's standing
there!'' Father's eyes began to itch. ""Ho, tonight I took the wrong

him a great quantity of the makdp that were there. ""Hey, come, the

they asked him. ""From early this morning I've been walking here;

others] speared fish; they [the children] cried for fish. I set out on my

them down together. I went along the SinAk, looking for fish, Along

"4 Present research, choice of dialect   The following description of the language is the result of an inves-
tigation into the coastal dialect around Flamingo Bay which was
carried out from November, 1960, to September, 1962, under the
auspices of the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea
(W.O.N.G.).s
   The aim of this research was the collecting of material for a descrip-
tion of one of the Asmat dialects. Outside Mission circles in New
Guinea, almost nothing was known about Asmat. Drabbe's grammar
of the Ajkm dialect had been published, though this fact was not
known to me until I arrived in the area, and found that the Mission
disposed over a few copies of it. The only thing on Asmat I had had
at my disposal was a short vocabulary at the end of Drabbe's KAmoro
grammar. Thus a preliminary orientation into the language was not
possible. The investigation had to be started from scratch,

schools in the Asmat region, the language taught in them being Malay,  Primitive Society, thesis, Van Gorcum & Co., Assen, 1964. This thesis also

the thing to do in this situation was to use Malay as the contact
language and to make use of bilingual informants - Asrnat Papuans
who had acquired a reasonable knowledge of Malay in school.
   On arrival in the area, it became clear that the number of Asrnat
Papuans with such a knowledge of Malay was meagre. These potential
informants belonged almost entirely to the younger generation -
children who had attended the three-year lower school of the Mission
at the Government Station at Agats, or who had left it. Only a few
of the ollder men knew some Malay. The children who went to school
in Agats came from the neighbouring village of Sur~?,and from Ajkrn.
The language of the village of Ajirn, already examined by Drabbe,
belonged to a dialect different from that of the coastal villages, one
of which was Surh, in the environs of Agats, and I therefore decided
to make the dialect spoken at Surh the object of the investigation.","[16, 17]"

  To sum up one can say that the vowel phonemes form a system of
three contrasting tongue heights. At the highest level, there is a
contrast front - back /i - u/; at the middle level, a contrast front -
central - back /e - C - o / ; while at the lowest level only /a/ occurs:
  According to my informants, the word [ond'Gw] was used only by the people
  who originated from the village of Kajt?. I had the impression that now only
  the older people within this group use it. The younger people, as well as the
  non-Kaj2 people in Suru, use the form [~nd'Gw].
16                                THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
   From the fo'regoing it is clear that a rounded allophone of /i/ and
/e/ occurs in analogous cases, while a rounded and an unrounded
allophone of /u/ and / o / , respectively, occur in analogous cases,. Later
it will become clear that there is a close connection between /i/ and /u/,
and between /e/ and /o/ which manifests itself in their occurrence
in word variants (see 8 55, 56) and in aflomorphs (see 5 91, 98).","[27, 28]"
"The anterioritive forms of the mediate past were never found as the
last verb in a sentence; they were always followed by at least one verb.
The anterioritive forms of the ultimate past can occur as the last verb
of a sentence. They then have a conditional meaning. I do not know
in how far their meailing is then identical to that of the forms of
category 10 with the prefix ca- ($ 130) and whether they are inter-
changeable with those forms :

168
I n the course of working on the material it became clear that the verbs
with the suffix -it/ut form a separate category. It was, therefore, not
possible to obtain a complete paradigm from my informants. It is,
however, possible, on. the basis of the cases noted, to deduce the
complete paradigm with rather great certainty. The forms not found
in the material are put between brackets in the paradigm that follows.
All these forms appear to have a semantic element of completion.

     scraping out can be done on different days, the trunk is marked off into sections.
     The bark is then removed only from one section at a time and the pith beneath
     it scraped out.
     See sketch p. 366.
     The gutter for washing the sago pith is made out of four of the central ribs
     of the fronds of the sago palm. See sketch p. 366.
     The omd is a kind of rope made from the leaves of the sago palm and used
     to tie together the sticks placed on either side of the sump trough to hold it
     in place. See sketch p. 366.289

more and more pulp. The pure sago flowed downwards. '(Tewer, take

                          THE ASMAT LANGUAGE7 Tape recording  A portable tape recorder was used extensively for the collecting
of the language data and the music. Thus texts and music could always
be got without difficulty. Only once was I requested not to record
a sacred song. The Asmat people were delighted to hear their own
music reproduced. Western music meant nothing to them. They were
not much interested in the texts, though this did not alter the fact that
the audience always listened critically and expressed their disapproval
in a very positive fashion of any deviations from the version they knew.
   The analysis of the texts collected appeared to be of great value for
an understanding of the language and it was through these that I came
upon the track of the special forms of the Asmat verb which express
varying moods.
   The language of the folk tales would not appear to differ from
common usage. Asmat songs, however, have their own vocabulary
which is known only to the older people, particularly the singers.
These latter were, however, less inclined to be con~municativeabout
it to strangers.","[19, 20]"

/</ I n addition to the vowels /a, e, i, o, u/ there occurs a mid-central
      vowel [a]. I n the first place, it is found in the following cases where
      it alternates with one of the other vowels :
      1. in words in isolation; only in the unaccented position: [fas'ak,
      fas'ak] white ; [en'am, an'am] fish ; [pitfin, pst'in] skin ; [pqr'o-w,
      par'ow] evening ; [juw'ur, j aw'ur ] dog.
      2. in words in context; also in the accented position: [yo, fa]
      river; [dfw'et, daw^t] elder brother ; [do 'not, do 'nat] I (stressed) ;
       [jumb'us, j am'as] with bowed head.
      In the second place, it does not alternate with one of the other
      vowels, for example in [Cam'en] penis ; [san'en] elbow; [?~mb'ow]
      abuse; [j'qpsres] sweat; [and'ow] mother.
      It also occurs in a number of verbal suffixes, such as: [-an, -ar].
                                 PHONOLOGY                                   15The possibility of this [a] occurring only in a consonantal environ-
   ment in which the other vowels do not occur, is excluded by the
   occurrence of word pairs, like the following:
                          [Eem]     = house
                          [Eam'an] = space under the house
    [Eam'en] = penis      [turnran] = a burn
                          [Eim'in] = the temple (of the head)
                          [combfit] = sponge made of young sago leaves
   The following minimal pairs were also found :
    [csmren] penis; [cm/en] stem of a canoe;
    [and'ow] mother ; [oncTow] thatch ;3
    [&porfes]they saw him (from por - to see) ;
    [&parfes] they sat (from ap - to sit).
   Since [a] occurs in the accented as well as the unaccented position
   in those cases in which it alternates with the other vowels, it is not
   possible to regard it here as an allophone common to /a, e, i, o, u/
   which is restricted to unaccented positions. Because [a] also occurs
   without alternating with the other vowels, in which cases I found
   some minimal pairs, it must be regarded as a phoneme be/. Cases
   of alternation must be regarded as cases of phoneme alternation.
   The phoneme / E / is then distinguished from the other vowels by
   its different behaviour, and because it is the only vowel phoneme
   without allophones.","[26, 27]"

   Now that this book is finished the time has come for me tot express
my indebtedness to those who have made it possible. My first
acknowledgement is to the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek
van de Tropen (WOTRO), formerly the Stichting Wetenschappelijk
Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea (WONG), The Hague, for making available
to me the money to enable me to carry out fieldwork in linguistics
for a period of two years in West New Guinea and, in addition, for
making it possible for me to devote myself exclusively on my return
to working on the material I had assembled. I owe a particular debt
to the Treasurer of the Stichting, Dr J. H. Westerrnann for his
continued and stimulating interest in the progress of the work.
   I am grateful to the Board of Directors of the Koninklijk Instituut
voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, The Hague, for their kindness
in publishing this thesis as one of the Verhandelingen of the Instituut.
   My thanks are due to Dr J. C. Anceaux and Mr B. J. Hoff for
their suggestions made during the preparation of the book, suggestions
upon which I place great value.
  The translator, Miss Jeune Scott-KenAall, has been painstaking in
the difficult task of translating this work and her critical observations
have frequently led to a clearer formulation of the facts. Her efforts
deserve great praise.
   I t is not possible to name every person who was so1 helpful to my
wife and me during our stay in New Guinea and who made our sojourn
one of great pleasure, but they are remembered with gratitude.
   I will, however, mention those who were directly concerned with
my work. Foremost among them were Dr A. A. Gerbrands and
Mr D. B. Eyde who were carrying out anthropological fieldwork in
the Asmat country. Their friendship and their continued interest was
a stimulus to my own work and their knowledge of Asmat culture
enabled me to catch a glimpse of the inner working of this remarkable
society. Here the name of Pater G. Zegwaard, M.S.C. at Merauke
must not pass without comment. By placing his own field notes at the
disposal of the fieldworkers in the Asrnat country, he made accessible

98                        THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
It will be seen from the paradigms that a series of forms occurs with
an aspect suffix - o h , and another series with an aspect suffix -erm/-er.
Though the formal contrast between the two series shows great similar-
ity with that between the formal and the informal series of the habitual
category, there does not appear to be a division into formal and informal
forms. The forms with - e m / - e r were only found with the verb e / j
to do, when it is linked to the repetitive form of a verb (cored); they
occur here instead of the forms with - c h . The two series appear to be
mutually exclusive.","[109, 110]"
"15   For reasons unknown to me the informants always used the informal forms
     with cores ending in es, it and awir, and the formal forms with cores ending
     in ifdm :

        If I play cards in the morning, at night, at noon, in the evening.. .
     Later, it appeared from the texts that the formal forms can occur with cores
     ending in it and es and the informal forms with cores ending in it& (6-porit-ci,
     &pores-&, d-poritUm-en).
     After a&,     however, the modal suffix is always zero so that the contrast
     formal-informal does not occur :
        d-percher-t if I continually look a t . . . . (formal & informal).

"14 The progressive forms
In this category there occur a series of no'n-mood forms and one series
of mood forms'. i n addition, a number of interrogative forms was found
which appear to be used exclusively in traditional stories. A dual form
of the 3rd. pers. occurs in the non-mood series. In contrast to the dual
forms of the hortative category, this one appears to be unproductive.
Until now, I have only found it in texts which were narrated by a
couple of old men who were approximately 50 or 60 years old. In these
texts, the dual form was not used consistently by the narrators. The
informants knew these dual forms, but in practise they made no
distinctioln between the 3rd. pers. pi. and the 3rd. pers. dual.
In the progressive forms, the durative formative occurs in the allomorph
a instead of aw&.

VI DEICTIC WORDSIntroduction206
Asmat has a number of deictic words which fall into two main groups:
I. non-interrogative pronouns ; 11. interrogative pronouns.
I. The non-interrogative pronouns, if we set aside the derivative forms,
can be set out in the folllowing scheme:                                                       ...............
                 no / nor               e / e r      1      ariw
                                    ...............
                  na/mr                   ja
                                          jh ka
                  ca / car                dtar                 personal            demonstrative       directional
                 possessiveThe form of this scheme rests on the following considerations:
1. the noln-interrogative pronouns fall into three class,es:
   personal possessive pronouns ; demonstrative pronouns ; and
   tional pronouns ;
   Of these, only the personal possessive pronouns have morphological
   valence ;
                                   WORD-CLASSES                                 1432. there is one 'neutral' deictic word, q'w, which links up with all
      three classes ;
3. I n all three classes we find pairs of word-variants: one variant
   ending in a vowel, the other in r.
The scheme makes it clear that there is a certain formal connection
between the classes: 1) because the deictic word a/ar belongs, to1 all
three classes; 2) because the same type of word-variants occurs in all
three classes.
Only with these deictic words do word-variants with and without
final r occur systeniatically : outside the deictic words, only a few
isolated cases were found.3611. The interrogative pronouns are ca/com, ucim and ucina.k/uci/uc.
I n this group the neutral deictic word a/w does not occur, nor do
word-variants with and without final r. The reasons for treating them
as one group will be given in $ 232.","[153, 154, 155]"
"
C a t e g o h l meaning
The progressive forms indicate that the action or the happening is or
was still in progress. They relate to the present and the ultimate past
to which, as I have already mentioned, belongs everything that has
occurred on the same day as the speech event, but prior to it, as well
as everything that took place so' long ago that it is known only from
tradition.19 When, however, the core ends in the formative itt4,z/!-z/1ithz,
es, if,/&, or a (durative), these forms only relate to the ultimate past
and appear to lack the progressive aspect.",[114]
"
The non-interrogative pronouns1. The personal posseswve class
207
This class consists of four personal possessive pronouns, to which the
neutral deictic word a / w is added :
                                            nor
                                            nar
                                            or
                                            car
                                           .....
                                            ar
The forms in set A will be called A variants ; those in set 33, I3 variants.38   1.e. the verbal forms ending in -cat-car, - c h / - c h a r , and -ma/-mar. See
     $$ 120, 136, 144.
144                         THE ASMAT LANGUAGEDistribution of variants.
208
When a personal possessive pronoun is linked to a substantive, we
find the B variant before a substantive beginning with a vowel; the
A variant before a substantive beginning with a consonant :

"299
 She hurried to the forest. ""Miwirpic, the trough's full of sago."" ""Ho,
my good girl, put it in the bag; take the rolls of sago and light a fire
made of dry sago leaves. Take a dry rib of a frond, place the lumps

began to work up the inner part of the pith, the last part of the inner
pitli, and the outer pith. She wrenched off the bark from the trunk;
pith - pith - she woriked it all up and she began with the pulp. More
and more pulp - she squeezed out all the pulp. At the lower end, she
first scraped out all the inner pith and a small part of the outer pith.
She squeezed out all pulp, and when she'd filled the bags full of sago
and had stored away the rolls of sago in the house, she went straight
to the forest, to her husband. ""Are you there?"" ""I'm here"". She burst
out wailing. Wailing, she threw herself into the mud. ""Oh, poor thing,
you mustn't be continually wailing and throwing yourself down,"" he
said. ""Have you got the sago out, or not?"" ""I've got [all] the sago out,
