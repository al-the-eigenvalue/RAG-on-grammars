23.1.5.3.1. Alternative indirect question without negationIn non-finite subordinate complement clauses an alternative question is
expressed with the indefinite pro-verb ja- which takes the same morphological
form as the subordinate clause predicate (namely, the participle in the
Accusative). The disjunctive particle -dA ... -dA follows the subordinate clause
predicate and the second predicate expressed by the indefinite pro-verb ja-.
Although formally the clause is organized as an alternative question, questions
without negation in fact correspond semantically to indirect polar (yes-no)
questions ('whether'-questions).(1693) a.   Iwana       xaundasi-e-ni           imo:-wo

23.1.2. Yes-no questionsYes-no questions are not marked by any additional morphological means or
changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence.
They are differentiated from them only by intonational patterns: the last word is
marked by a higher and more prolonged intonational contour (3.6.4). The finite
verb normally occupies the clause-final position. Examples (1675) show
ordinary yes-no questions, and examples (1676) illustrate negative yes-no
questions.(1675) a.   Nua-ni        tue      eme-gi-ze?

"
23.1.4.1. Alternative questions with the pro-verbThe alternative question can be formed with the pro-verb ja- as the second
disjunct. The pro-verb takes the same morphological form as the finite verb in
the first disjunct: in (1681a) they are both in the 2nd person Singular Future, in
(1681b) in the 3rd person Singular Present. This type is used when the
alternatives are described by the same verb in a positive and a negative form.

23.1.1.3.1. Questions to the verbal phraseExamples of questions where the interrogative pro-verb co-occurs with the
Accusative object interrogative pronoun j 'e-we 'what' are:(1657) a.   J'e-we              ja:-i?
            what-ACC            PROV-2SG
            'What were you doing?'
       b.   Si j'e-we           ja-ζαηα-ί?
            you what-ACC        PROV-FUT-2SG
            'What will you do?'
       c.   Ono         ja:-i                   mä:usa-i?

            'What did you do with your gun?' (SK 431)Such questions refer to the whole verbal phrase and do not presuppose an
answer that includes only the direct object. Thus, the answer to (1657) can be,
for example, (1658a), but not (1658b).(1658) a.    Olokto-zoqo-i.

       b.   *ugda-wa
            boat-ACC
            'a boat'
23.1.1.3.2. Questions to adverbialsWhen the interrogative pro-verb is the only interrogative word in the sentence,
its various morphological forms express various, normally adverbial,
interrogative meanings. For example, the interrogative pro-verb in the
Directive form corresponds to the meaning 'go for which reason?' (1659).
When used in the subordinate clause the Purposive Converb of the
interrogative pro-verb corresponds to the meaning 'what for?' (1660), and the
directive Infinitive renders the meaning 'why' (1661).
                                                                   Questions 803(1659)5/ jar¡-na-sa:-i                            min-tigi?

      zulie-ze-le-nu?
      front-N-LOC-DIS
      'Where will you travel: in the front or in the back?' (K 153)
23.1.4.3. Alternative questions with negationIf in an alternative question the second negative alternative is emphasized, this
is expressed in the second disjunct with negative verb e- which takes the
morphological form of the content verb, or the negative auxiliary anci. Both the
finite verb in the first disjunct and the negative verb in the second disjunct are
followed by the clitic particle -nu... -nu.",[848]
"
23.1.4. Alternative questionsThere are several types of alternative questions. None of these types is formed
with only one disjunctive element (such as or in English). Instead two
disjunctive elements are used. Intonation typically rises at the end of the first
disjunct and falls at the end of the sentence.",[845]
"
23.1.5.3.2. Alternative indirect questions with negationIn alternative indirect questions with negation the negative alternative is
highlighted and the negative verb e- functions as a predicate of the second
disjunct. As in indirect alternative questions without negation, in non-finite
clauses predicates in both disjuncts are marked with the particle -dA ... -dA
(1695), while in the finite clause the particles -As(i)... -As(i) (1696) or -nu ...
-nu (1697) are present.(1695) a.   Bi ei-mi               sa:      nua-ni           tala-wa

       Try whether the tea is hot.' (SK 1036)
23.2. NegationExcept for some special constructions, Udihe does not make the formal
difference between sentence negation and constituent negation. Examples of
these two negation types are presented below in 23.2.1 and 23.2.2, respectively.
In both cases, negation is expressed with the negative auxiliary verb e-/ei-,
which precedes the content verb and may take various morphological forms,
e.g. e-si-ti etete-du 'they were not working' <NEG-PAST-3PL work-PL>, e-s'e-li
etete 'without having worked' <NEG-PERF-CC.SS work>. For more
information on the conjugation of the negative verb and the form of the content
verb in negative sentences see 7.3 and 7.1.4. In certain copular constructions
negation is expressed by the impersonal copula anci 'no'.
   Normally, the negative verb immediately precedes the content verb;
however, it is sometimes possible for it to be placed after the verbal stem, as
below.(1699) a.   Nada         gida   bul'a-wa-ni                 xai-ge-si

auxiliary and the content verb, as is shown below. This is not a very frequent
option, however. The constituent that can be inserted between the negative verb
and the content verb is normally an oblique or indirect object (1700), or some
kind of adjunct (1701).(1700) a.   E-te-mi-ne                  zugdi-tigi       i:mi    i: ?

23.2.1. Sentence negation23.2.1.1. Regular negationHere we exemplify ordinary sentence negation (1702) and negation of some
special constructions: the subjectless sentence (1703a), the agentless passive
(1703b), the active agentless construction (1703c), the impersonal
Necessitative (1703d), and the passive (1703e).","[853, 854, 855]"
"
7.8.1.3.2. Perfect in yes-no questionsClose to the resultative function is the use of the Perfect in yes-no questions
which refer to the situation in the past, whereas in w/i-questions about an event
in the past it is typically the Past tense that is used. In such an utterance the
focus domain extends over the verb alone.

"
3.6.4. Sentence stressTypically, the intonation falls at the end of the sentence. However in yes-no
questions and disjunctive questions (23.1.2, 23.1.4) intonation rises
considerably on the last word of the sentence. When the last word of a sentence
is prominent, this may be expressed by a rising pitch on the stressed vowel. In
the examples below an acute accent indicates a rising pitch.(126) a.   Stepana       eme-gi-e-ni.      Ni

"In finite subordinate questions the disjunctive particle -As(i) ... -As(i) is used
instead of the particle -dA ... -dA, so the finite indirect alternative question does
not differ formally from the direct alternative question (23.1.4).(1694) a. Xaundasi-je          ono      nixe-ze       guline-zeije-ni-es

23.1.5.3. Alternative indirect questionsBoth for finite and non-finite subordinate clauses there are two types of
alternative questions: with the interrogative pro-verb and with the negative verb
in the second disjunct.",[851]
"
23.1.4.2. Alternative questions with the particle -nu... -nu 'either... or'The clitic particle -nu... -nu 'either ... or' expresses disjunction in questions. It
seems basically to have the same meaning as the particle -As(i) ... -As(i),
although it is likely to render a greater degree of emphasis. Below it is shown
following the predicate and the non-predicate constituent, although the former
function is more typical of this particle.(1685)a.    Su xulise:-u-nu                ja:-u-nu?

22.2.4. Predicate droppingIn (1587) we illustrate an ellipsis of the verb which is immediately recoverable
from the linguistic context. The usual answer to a wA-question consists only of
a questioned constituent in a fully inflected form (1587b). Examples (1588)
present an instance of colloquial speech where all the verbs are omitted, so that
the predicative functions seem to be fulfilled by adverbial expressions.(1587) a.   Uta-digi    ñugi-e-ti                od'oko          ñoxoli

24.1.2.3. Predicate focusThe subject is postposed to the postverbal position when the focus extends over
the verb alone. This covers the following cases: (i) an ""urgent news"" report
(1775); (ii) when the verb is in potential contrast (1776) or questioned (yes-no
questions as in (1777) and answers to them); or (iii) when the action itself is
emphasized and presented with an effect of immediateness (1778).(1775) a.   Buk-ki-ni          Uza.

24.1.3. Verb finalityVerb finality is violated by the subject postposed under certain conditions
(24.1.2). In addition, it can be violated as a result of object postposing. When
an element other than the direct object corresponds to the focus function, the
direct object in the transitive clauses is likely to be postposed and stand after
the verb (1779). However, it may also be located before the focus element, so
variants such as (1780a) and (1780b) are both acceptable, while the latter is
likely to express a greater degree of contrast.","[880, 881]"

7.8.2.1. The Present Habitual7.8.2.1.1. Habitual meaningThe Present Habitual refers to a general timeless situation rather than the
moment of speech. It expresses an action not localized in time. Thus, in answer

      he-3SG what-ACC         do-3SG
      'What is she doing (now)?'the Habitual is not acceptable, as illustrated in (412a). Only the Present tense of
the general (412b) or Progressive (412c) aspect can be used:(412) a.    *Caja-wa      umi:.
            tea-ACC      drink.PRP
            'She is drinking tea.'

"
23.1.1. W7i-questionsIn w/i-questions the question word (a certain form of the Interrogative pronoun)
replaces the questioned constituent. Question words are listed in 9.5. Any
constituent of the main clause can be questioned in this way. The position of
the question word is strictly before the finite predicate, in accordance with the
more general rule on the preverbal position of the focus element (24.1.1). The
only exception is the question word i:mi 'why' (23.1.1.6). In questions to the
modifier the whole modified noun phrase must immediately precede the
predicate. The preverbal question word, like other focus elements (24.1.1), may
be sentence-initial (1647), however, other constituents (in particular the
subject) can precede it, as in (1648).(1647) a.   J'e-we        nixe-ini      si      sita-i?

23.1.5. Indirect questions23.1.5.1. Finite clauseThe finite subordinate clause is described in Chapter 18. In indirect constituent
questions the question word immediately precedes the subordinate clause
predicate. The question word (interrogative pronoun) may have the same form
as regular question words used in direct questions (9.5). Alternatively, indirect
questions may be formed with non-specific indefinite pronouns derived with
the clitic particle -dA (9.6.2), which function here as interrogative pronouns
(1691). In both cases, the subordinate clause is not followed by any evidential
particles, even if this is required for the corresponding non-interrogative
subordinate clauses (18.3.1).(1690) a.   Si muisi-si:                ono      nixe-ini?

The Proprietive forms are not present in the negative construction. Instead, the

possessed noun in the Partitive is combined with the impersonal copula anài.
As in the non-negative counterpart, the construction in question does not
contain any possessive noun phrase. However, as demonstrated in (1725), the
Partitive can be formed from the nominal stem augmented by the suffix of
inalienable possession -ψ-.(1724) a.   Nua-ni       kesi-le        anci.

23.1.3. Contrastive questionsContrastive questions are marked by the focus clitic particle -nA or -nu
following a contrastive element. In w/i-questions the particle is used when the
subject questioned is in explicit or implicit contrast with certain other elements
(1677). In polar questions it normally follows a focused predicate (1678), while
(1679) shows a focus on the spatial adverb. The contrastive word is marked by
a rise in intonation, but the clitic does not attract it to itself.(1677) a.   Si min-e-we         dian-a-i            bi-s'e-i

23.1.1.4. Questions to modifiersAny constituents of the noun phrase may be questioned. The question words
j'eu 'what sort o f , and ni 'whose' questioning a possessive modifier require
that the head noun be marked by the 3rd person Singular Possessive affix. On
the possessive construction see 13.1.(1662) a.   J'eu         mo:-ni            asi     gugda?

"Questions to non-possessive modifiers are formed with the interrogative

23.1.1.5. Questions to copular constructionsQuestions to predicative words expressed by various noun phrases are formed
by substituting the interrogative pronoun j'eu 'what' in the corresponding case
form for the questioned constituent. In (1664) we exemplify questions to the
nominative noun phrase (construction described in 17.2.1.2), in (1665)
questions to adverbial predicative words (17.2.2.2.3), and in (1666) questions
to the predicative word of the comparative postpositional construction

23.1.1.1. Questions to the noun phraseQuestions to noun phrases are formed with the interrogative pronouns j'eu, j'e-
'what' and ni 'who' in the corresponding case. The subject w/z-word triggers 3rd
person Singular agreement on the finite verb. Examples (1651) illustrate
questions to the subject; examples (1652), (1653a), (1653b), (1653c), and
(1653d) illustrate questions to the Accusative, Ablative, Dative, Instrumental,

23.1.1.6. The question word 'why'The question word i:mi/j'emi 'why' is the only wh-word that need not be
located in the immediately pre verbal position: it is usually clause-initial and
can be separated from the verb by other lexical material (1670). However, it
may also be strictly preverbal, as in (1671).

"
17.2.1.2.2. Grammatical relationsThe question which arises at this point is which grammatical relation is borne
by an element like torji-le 'in the lake' in (1230b). In (1230a) the noun phrase
ei ΐοηί-le is apparently not an argument and can easily be dropped from the
sentence without affecting its well-formedness. In the copular destinati ve
construction, however, the same noun phrase is required for the
well-formedness of the sentence, as distinct from (1230a). A sentence which
consists only of the Destinative Participle, such as, for example (1233), would
be ungrammatical.(1233) *egbesi-kci.
      swim-DPAccording to this criterion, the noun phrase ίοηΐ-le should be identified as an
argument rather than as an adjunct. It is also possible that it is a part of the
predicative expression. However, its exact status as an argument is
controversial, and we will leave this question open.",[653]

23.2.1.4. Negation of stateThe stative negative construction is formed analytically with the copular verb
bi- in the corresponding personal form and the content verb: a stem followed
by the contrastive clitic particle -gdA (12.1.1.8).

12.1.1.7. Replacing particle -IAThe clitic particle -IA is characteristic of the Northern dialect, although it is
occasionally found in the Bikin dialect as well. Its main function is to encode
the new (replaced) topic, so it may be termed a replacing particle. Since the
topic normally corresponds to the subject (Chapter 24), the scope of the particle
-IA is usually a subject NP.","[482, 483]"

-As(i) 'either ... or' (for the use of this particle in declarative disjunctive
sentences see Chapter 18). It follows the finite verb in the first disjunct and the
interrogative pro-verb ja:- present in the second disjunct in the same

associated with the focus. In Udihe, the position of the question word is
necessarily strictly preverbal. On exceptions see 23.1.1.6. Examples of
preverbal question words, clause-initial (1766) and non clause-initial (1767) are
cited below.(1766) a.   I:-le      b'a-i                  si        mamasa-na-mi?

12.2.1.5. Affectionate addressIn folklore tales and songs the word bajani or its expressive variant baja-nie (<

-ni. This word is approximately translated as '(my) dear'.(919) a.    rjua-je              qua-je                   xudasi:          ni:

      aja ijenemo:               'good bye (to somebody who leaves)'In the general meaning 'no' the negative copula anci can be used. However its
usage is somewhat restricted, and it is more natural to use the corresponding
form of the negative auxiliary verb instead (see 7.3.3.3). Some examples of the
use of formulaic expressions are:(921) a.    Gele           zegdem              guas'a.

12.2.3. InterjectionsUdihe is extremely rich in the ideophonic words that in some way characterize the
action expressed by the verb. These words have an adverbial function and are
internal to the clause. They are treated in ChapterlO. In this section we will only
cite inteqections and onomatopoetic words that represent a direct ""quotation"" and
function outside the clause. For more interjections and onomatopoetic words in
the Northern dialect see Sunik (1968: 228-229), and text materials in KormuSSin

6.4.1.1.2. Diminutive adjectives with the suffix -c'A/s'AAlthough these suffixes are not productive, they are present in many words.
The suffixes are ultimately related to the nominal Diminutive suffixes
-s'A-/-sA- (5.1.2.1). In fact, two variants ending in -c'A and -s'A can often be
found for one word (see the examples below). All the adjectives derived with
the suffixes in question are parametric and denote a low degree of a measurable
feature (remarkably, adjectives that denote a high degree of the same feature do
not have any derivational resemblance). Only for some are the base or related
words known (284a), while for others they are not present in the modern
language (284b).(284) a.     nepte-s'e/nekte-s'e            'low' nepte-ligi     'flat'

which strengthens its meaning: (q)i-c'a-c'a 'very small'. The adjectives
derived with the suffix in question have an emphatic form in -i which produces
the same effect: (y)i-c'a-i 'very small' (see 6.1.2.4).","[218, 219]"

9.5.1.3. Tag question functionThe pronoun j'eu in the Nominative can express a tag question. The verb may

             'It wasn't difficult to go (there), was it?' (SK 428)
9.5.1.4. SubstantivizationThe pronoun j'eu when substantivized can mean 'things, belongings, property',
as illustrated in the following example:(627)    Sita-na-fi             j'e-ne-fi                b'a-nti          teu
         child-DEST-REF.PL      what-DEST-REF.PL         get-INF          all
         ute    bagdi-e-ti.
         that live-PAST-3PL
         'Having had children and property they carried on living.' (K 200)9.5.2. Interrogative pro-adjectivesSome of the interrogative adjectives are derived from the j'e- base while others
are from adverbial interrogative stems (9.5.3). These are:
352 Pronouns(628) adi                'how many, how much'
      ja-ma              'made of what'                   <what-ADJ>
       ono-fi            'what sort of                    <how-ADJ>
      ali-fi             'what sort of, from what time'   <when-ADJ>
      adi-(n)ti          'which (in number)'              <how.many-ORD>
      adi(-ma)           'how many, how much'             <how.many-ADJ>
      adi-te             'how many to each'               <how.many-DIST>
      adi-t'e            '(only) how many'                <how.many-REST>
      adi-tiiija         'how many (together)'            <how.many-COL>
      wogdime            'how many'Syntactically, these elements behave like other pronominal modifiers (13.4).
  The repetition of the adjective adi(ma) causes the indefinite meaning:
adi(ma) adi(ma) 'several', or the distributive meaning: adi adi 'how many to
each'. Note also ono-bui-ono-bui 'various'.","[385, 386]"
"Questions about the future asked when there is some doubt about the reality of
the situation are illustrated below.(438) a.    Ono          metu-ze-m(i)             bi?

"7.9.5. PermissiveThe Permissive is a rarely used mood, since nearly all its meanings can be
expressed by the Subjunctive or Imperative. The term Permissive is very
conventional, because permissive is only one of several possible meanings. The
Permissive has three rather different functions: permissive, uncertain Future,
and deliberative questions. In fact, Schneider describes the Permissive as two
different sets of forms, one for a type of Imperative (the 2nd person) and the
other one as a remote Future (all personal forms). However, these two
sub-paradigms exhibit a complete formal (and partly a semantic) parallelism,
and are therefore here unified in one paradigm, that of the Permissive mood.",[304]

21.1.1.7. Multiple w/i-questionsMultiple w/t-questions are allowed, although rarely; an example is (1673).(1673) a.   J'e-we      ni-tigi         diarj-ki-ni?
            what-ACC who-LAT            say-PAST-3SG
            'What did he say, and to whom?'
       b.   Ono         imi     ute     bede     ede-i?
            how         why     that    like     become-PP
            'How and why did it happen like this?'",[842]
"(619) J'eu-zeyezi     bi'asa-digi-ni          o-lo                ihn-e-i?
      what-ABL          river-ABL-3SG         this-LOC            come-0-2SG
      'From which river did you come here?' (SK 1108)Used as independent w/i-words interrogative pro-nouns inflect for case.
Non-Nominative forms express various ννΛ-questions in argument and
adverbial positions (23.1.1). In the subject function the pronoun j'eu 'what' in
the Nominative triggers Singular agreement on the verb, while the pronoun ni
'who' may trigger both Singular and Plural agreement. Apart from its regular
meaning ('to what'), the Dative form j'e-du/i:-du can mean 'why, what for'.
The pronoun j'eu 'what' in the Nominative also means 'why' or 'what for' (as
in Russian where cto 'what' can mean 'why, what for' in a colloquial speech),
cf.:(620) a.    J'eu        dieze-tigi       gaisi:-ni        min-e-we?
            what        depth-LAT        call-3SG         me-0-ACC
            Why is he calling me in the depth?' (K 140)
       b.   Si          j'eu     ketu    go:       bi:?
            You          what very       long      be.2SG
            'Why were you so long?' (K 146)
350 Pronouns   Repetition of the pronoun j'eu or j'e-we intensifies the question, cf.: j'eu j'e-
le-ni 'where on earth' <what what-LOC-3SG>, j'eu j'e-we-ni 'what on earth'
<what what-ACC-3SG> (SK 424), cf. also:(621) J'e-we          jemi    zexule-i?
      what-ACC        why     behave.badly-2SG
      'Why on earth do you behave so badly?' (SK 337)  The Lati ve form j'eu-xi may be used in the meaning 'which of (them)'.","[383, 384]"
