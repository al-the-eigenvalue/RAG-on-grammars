"7.7.2.1 Polar questions
Polar questions do not involve a question word. They consist of a full sentence and
expect an answer in terms of yes and no. Polar questions in Makalero need not be
marked morphologically as such. In such cases, it is only the rising-falling
intonation contour that marks them as interrogatives. An example is given in (117),
with the corresponding pitch contour shown in Figure 7.4. Note that the overall pitch
contour gently rises, reaching a peak on the final syllable; following this pitch peak,
there is a distinctive drop on that same syllable.(117)                    … ei so’ot=ini ueri                leuk?
                           2s want=LNK1 bottom drill

Figure 7.4: Ei so’ot=ini ueri leuk ‘do you want to have (your) bottom drilled?’, pitchNa’an, the negative existential, and oko-na ‘not yet’ are frequently used as one-word
answers to yes/no-questions. There is, however, no good positive one-word answer.
The Portuguese loan sim ‘yes’ is found in that function very occasionally. Also,
speakers accepted the verb tafi ‘true’ as a one-word answer upon questioning,
though such a structure was not produced in natural speech. In general, the most
common reply to a polar question is the repetition of a part of or the whole sentence.
Two examples are shown in (118) and (119).","[463, 464]"

(117) above, it is these superordinate verbs that are repeated as one-word answers
two polar questions. That is, a positive answer to a question as (117) is so’ot ‘(I)
want’.
Polar questions can be overtly marked as such by the markers =ua and =uai (na’an),
both of which are cliticised to the right end of the question. Note that =ua is
homophonous with the relative marker (§ 3.3.5.1, p. 240). While a historical
relationship between the two is unproven, it is a fact that relative makers very
commonly derive from interrogative words cross-linguistically. (120) and (121) give

examples of the use of =ua as a question marker (see § 7.7.1, p. 435, above for the
use of the same particle with declaratives).","[464, 465]"

verbal in nature. In fact, those given in Table 3.15 have clear full verb uses, where
they are the only predicates in a clause.

one-word answer to a yes-no question, which shows that it is predicative on its own.
On the other hand, in (181), teni ‘again’ is the predicate in a full clause, with its own
subject ei (2s).","[185, 186]"
"3.2.3.3.2 Clausal adverbials
The adverbial expressions discussed in § 3.2.3.1.1 (p. 141) are fully clausal by
themselves. Since the predicate is the only obligatory element in a clause (see § 6,
p. 383), they must be predicative. Verbs are the unmarked choice for the predicate
function. There is no evidence, such as an argument use, suggesting such adverbials
are of any other category. By a process of elimination, then, clausal adverbials are
analysed as verbal. They differ from other verbs mainly with respect to valency, in
that they are not associated with any arguments at all. Furthermore, even though
they are fully clausal, they are not found forming utterances on their own, but are
used only in multi-clause sentences. For instance, the answer to the information
question in (186) repeats the whole question; an answer consisting of only the focal
part, kaminei ‘tomorrow’, is considered unacceptable. Similarly, in (187), the
avalent adverbial predicate tone’ ‘perhaps’ does not constitute an acceptable answer
to the question; it must be combined with another predicate, in this case fani’ ‘like
(this)’.(186)   … papa            hai     lolo “ei tetepane’ la’a=na’a?” uai=ni     ani hai

speakers use the clitic =uai ‘or’ at the end of a declarative. This morpheme is more
commonly a question marker and its use in declaratives is an idiosyncracy of
individual speakers. (116) gives an example, including the sentence ending in =uai
as well as the following sentence. Note that the particle is not repeated in tail-head
linkage (§ 9.3.1, p. 507). The pitch contour of the bracketed part in (116), shown in
Figure 7.3, demonstrates that such declaratives end in a distinctive rising intonation,
similar to questions marked by the same morpheme (see § 7.7.2.1, p. 438).(116)                   ... [liurai Iliomar hai          isa=uai].          Liurai Iliomar hai       isa=ni

7.7.2 Interrogatives
There are two kinds of interrogatives, namely polar questions (yes/no-questions) and
interrogative word questions (wh-questions). In the following, § 7.7.2.1 (p. 438)
gives a short discussion of polar questions, followed by § 7.7.2.2 (p. 443) on
interrogative word questions.","[460, 461, 462, 463]"

which clauses made up of single verbs are found. On the contrary, participants that
are retrievable from the context are readily left unexpressed. (9) and (10) show
sentences with unexpressed subject arguments, the positions of which are marked by
Ø. In (9), which comes from a spoken text, the speaker assumes the hearer to be able
to infer the intended subject referent, since it has been the topic in previous
sentences. (10), on the other hand, comes from a context-less elicited clause. In this
example, apparently the speaker deemed a third person pronominal object to be at
180
   As found with divalent verbs; the class of avalent verbs (§ 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141), on the other hand, is not
compatible with any arguments. In a clause centred on an avalent verb, the core is made up of only the
predicate.

not expressed. In fact, (75) is the answer to the question in (76). As such, (75) could
be seen as an elliptical sentence, where a clause expressing the consequence as given
in the question is left unexpressed after uai=konai. A complete version of the
answer, with expression of the consequence clause, would presumably look like

 8.3.5 Complement clause extensions to verbs of saying
and modal verbs
A problematic case for the classification of clause linkage types into either
coordinating or subordinating ones is presented by verbs of saying and modal verbs
(§ 3.2.3.10, p. 186) and their, for lack of a better term, complement clause
extensions. A common characteristic of all these constructions is that they can be
expressed in the form of a coordinative clause linkage either without a marker, or
using =ini, as shown in (110) and (111), respectively.(110)   … ei-dada=ni             ei asar=isi ei dadau [mei la’a ue’].

                                                                     (103-08)Syntactically, constructions such as those in (110) and (111) show little signs of
being in a hierarchical relationship. § 3.2.3.10.1.2 (p. 189) shows that such verbs as
fana ‘teach’, fuin ‘dare’, pada ‘order’ and der ‘reply’ allow for the expression of a
preverbal undergoer object alongside a postverbal complement clause extension.
This shows that the complement clause extension does not function as an argument
to the verb in question; if it did, such constructions would violate the maximal clause
template, which allows for the expression of two arguments at most in a clause (§ 6,
p. 383). § 3.6.2 (p. 265) speculates that such postverbal complement clause
extensions originate as regular arguments to a separate verb, reflected in today’s
quotative marker ain (§ 3.2.3.12.3, p. 205). The clausal complement would then
486                                      CHAPTER 8
have been the object argument to that verb of saying in the regular preverbal non-
subject argument position.
There is, however, one use of such constructions which does seem to indicate some
hierarchical relation between the two clauses involved. It involves polar questions
and the answers to them. As (112) shows, a reply to a polar question generally
repeats the VP of the question. The reply to a polar question involving a modal verb
and its complement clause extension in a coordinated construction, however, repeats
only the modal verb, as shown in (113).","[510, 511]"

specifically, questions to which the speaker does not know the answer. The
following clause generally contains the verb ma’en ‘know’ and is negated,
expressing the speaker’s ignorance on the subject. The indirect question can be
understood as a left-dislocated object to that clause’s verb of knowing. Examples are
given in (49) and (50).

(49) and (50), this is not necessarily the case, as (51), with what looks like an
affirmative, demonstrates. Note that =oo is used twice here; the first occurrence
marks the clausal object to ma’en ‘know’, whereas the second, cliticised on NP level
to the first person plural exclusive pronoun ini, corresponds to English ‘too’ (see
§ 3.5.2.1, p. 245).","[491, 492]"

This clause structure represents the maximum clause180 and is very rigid, imposing
strict syntactic constraints on the expression of participants. Consequently,
somewhat more complex states of affairs, such as those involving a predicative
adverbial expression or those with more than two participants, must be expressed in
two clauses, while they constitute, both semantically as well as phonologically, a
single event or utterance. Such sentences are discussed in § 7.1 (p. 402). The
biclausal expression of a ditransitive state of affairs qualifies as one argument
structure construction in Goldberg’s (1995) terminology.
In natural speech, a minority of clauses fill all the positions provided by the clause
templates in (3) and (4). In fact, the nucleus of the clause, or its predicate, is the only
obligatory element. Both verbal arguments as well as any kinds of periphery
elements are readily omittable, given an appropriate context. As such, a single verb
can make up a complete clause. Examples are shown in (5) and (6), which show the
negative existential na’an and the modal verb so’ot ‘want, like’, respectively, used
as minimal answers to polar questions. Both are full verbs, which can take a subject
argument and aspect marking, as shown for na’an in (7), and a subject argument, an
aspect marker, and a complement argument, as shown for so’ot in (8).","[409, 410]"

         ‘… she went first and I went afterwards…’                         (44-12)NPs marked by =ini can be both contrastive topics as well as contrastive foci. The
constituents marked with =ini in (28) and (32) are clear topics; (28) comes from a
text describing the difficult relations among the speaker’s clan members; thus, the
different groups within the clan, expressed in (28) as amuni ki=rial=ee ‘many
people’ and ini ‘we (excl.)’, respectively, are clearly topical. Also, the text from
which (32) is taken describes a night-time adventure by the speaker and her sister,
who, being the protagonists of the narrative, are topical. The NPs marked by =ini in
(29) and (30), on the other hand, are preferably interpreted as foci in that they fill an
empty position in the proposition. In the question in (30), this empty position is
overt in the form of the question word sa’a- ‘what (BD)’. This shows that =ini is a
marker of contrastiveness rather than a marker of either contrastive topics or foci.
The contrastive marker is identical in form to the most general clause linker =ini
(§ 3.5.2.5, p. 247), and in fact most likely an extension of it. This fact makes the
contrastive construction with =ini obviously comparable to a cleft construction: as a
linker, =ini stands between two clauses, marking the boundary between them. As a
contrastive marker, too, =ini separates the nominal constituent it is cliticised to from
the rest of the clause. Recall that NPs can freely be used as predicates (§ 5.1,
p. 318); in such a case, a noun phrase x is generally interpreted as ‘it is (an) x’. The
noun phrase separated from the rest of the clause by the contrastive =ini can thus be
seen as a full clause consisting only of a nominal predicate. The presence of the VP-
internal adverbial na’u ‘just’ in front of the NP ripa-ripa-ate ‘any tree’ in (33)
supports this analysis.","[526, 527]"

subjects of the two clauses in question are unexpressed, the use of =isi is clear
enough an indicator to ensure a correct understanding of the sentence. An example is
given in (20), where the answer to the question ‘why is this child crying?’ basically
consists of two verbs only, namely pase ‘beat’ and iar ‘cry’. The linker =isi between
these two predicates indicates that these actions are not carried out by the same
agents, while uai=konai (see § 8.1.6, p. 471) shows that the second is to be
understood as a consequence of the first. The overall interpretation is thus as shown
in (20).",[484]

As discussed in § 3.2.3.6 (p. 167) and § 3.3.1.4 (p. 228), question words in Makalero
fall into two separate lexical classes. Sa’a- ‘what (BD)’ and mu’a- ‘who (BD)’ have
been categorised as pronouns, while all other question words are verbal.
(126) shows a monoclausal question with the pronominal interrogative sa’a- ‘what
(BD)’, while (127) exemplifies a question with the interrogative taure- ‘which (BD)’
functioning as the complement to fani’ ‘be like’. The whole of this complement-verb
complex translates as ‘how’. Notwithstanding the different syntactic status of the
interrogatives used, the corresponding pitch contours show that the intonation is
largely the same, i.e. gently falling. Notice, however, the very slight peak on the
(pen)ultimate in both cases.(126)                    ... ah        mata-niki ii sa’a-seur            nua?

9.2.3 Markers of information structure

that help structuring the information given in a text. The following sections give
short discussions on the clitic contrastive marker =ini (§ 9.2.3.1, p. 501), the
counter-presupposition clitic =haka (§ 9.2.3.2, p. 503), the adverbial expression
na’a.muni (§ 9.2.3.3, p. 505) and finally the somewhat enigmatic clitic =oo
(§ 9.2.3.4, p. 506). Another marker of contrastiveness, the attributive ki=, stands
within the NP and is discussed in § 4.3.4 (p. 284).

The NP-level clitic =ini (§ 3.5.2.5.1, p. 248) functions as a marker of
contrastiveness. Its principle function in such contexts is the marking of the referent
of its NP host as contrasting with another possible referent. Typical examples are
given in (28) and (29).(28)     … amuni ki=rial=ee                   so’ot=ini dame=na’a=po ini=ni

         ‘That’s what I was afraid of.’                                  (elic671)In (28), ini=ni (the first person plural exclusive pronoun with the contrastive marker
cliticised to it) contrasts with an explicitly mentioned set of other people (amuni
ki=rial=ee ‘many people’), whereas in (29), the contrast is not expressed, but only
implied. Also, (28) and (29) show that the contrastive marker can both lose its initial
vowel if cliticised to a vowel-final element or retain it; it shares this characteristic
with the clause linker =ini (see § 3.5.2.5.2, p. 249).
A context where the contrastive =ini appears particularly frequently is in
interrogative word questions and their answers, as exemplified in (30). Note that
mu’ani ‘who’ and sa’ani ‘what’, the subject forms of the interrogatives mu’a- ‘who
(BD)’ and sa’a- ‘what (BD)’, respectively, are actually grammaticalised
combinations of the stem and the contrastive marker =ini, as shown by the fact that
both mu’ani ‘who’ and sa’ani ‘what’ can be marked as contrastive with another
=ini, yielding mu’ani=ini and sa’ani=ni, respectively (see § 3.3.1.4, p. 228).","[525, 526]"

used as a de-facto question marker similar to =ua. An example of this use is given in

question resembles that of the question with the =uai na’an tag in Figure 7.6, with
the exception that it is cut short, so to speak, right after the pitch peak reached on the
clitic =uai. While there is a slight lowering of the curve on the last syllable, it lacks
the distinctive fall found on unmarked questions and those with the marker =ua.
This confirms that the question marker =uai is a shortened from of the =uai na’an
question tag rather than an interrogative marker in its own right.

stressed that this is infrequent; the main function of the LDP is to hold topicalised
constituents.
§ 7.6.2 (p. 434) tentatively introduced an RDP, though evidence for it is slim. Right-
dislocated constituents are restricted to two contexts: question words and
afterthoughts, as illustrated by (24) and (25), respectively. Even in those contexts,
however, they are rare. Note that in (25), the afterthought gives more information to
the topic in the LDP; this sentence thus combines a filled LDP as well as a filled
(putative) RDP.","[523, 524]"

associated with an undergoer. Lesa ‘not have’, lu’a ‘not get’ and tule ‘not want’, on
the other hand, are clearly transitive and include an undergoer participant in their
semantic participant frame. The cases of nopa’e ‘cannot’ and oko-na ‘not yet’ and
irau ‘not allowed’ are somewhat unclear with respect to transitivity. Used as full
verbs, they do not cooccur with non-subject arguments, indicating that they are
intransitive. On the other hand, constructions where they are used as complement
verbs suggest that they may take an argument expressing an undergoer; the evidence
in question is provided in § 3.2.3.10.2.1 (p. 193). Finally, isipo’ ‘not know’ is in all
cases used as a clause on its own, without any participants expressed. An example is
(211). It is therefore impossible to determine its transitivity.(211)    … elehaa ei asar=ee taure-fani’?               -   Isipo’...

"
8.2.1 Summary
The large majority of clause linkage types discussed in the pervious sections show
no syntactic evidence of a hierarchical relation between the clauses involved. The
clause linkers used in these constructions basically combine two independent
clauses, without affecting them otherwise. § 8.3.6 (p. 488) argues that the same
sentences, including the linkers, may alternatively be used in subordinating
constructions. Hence the linkage between two clauses as expressed by this one
group of clause linkers is really indeterminate as to the syntactic relation between
them. In general, a time-iconic ordering of the clauses in question is preferred,
although some linkers, such as =isi (LNK2, § 8.1.1, p. 457) and =konai (CSQ,
§ 8.1.6, p. 471), exhibit a very moderate degree of positional freedom.
The linkers =taa (PURP, § 8.1.8, p. 474) and =kini (IND, § 8.1.9, p. 476) differ
from the majority of clause linkers in that they can not only be placed between the
two clauses they link, but, alternatively or additionally, also within the second clause
of the structure. As such, in these cases, the second clause is structurally affected by
the linkage and can be analysed as subordinated (see § 8.3, p. 481, for more
discussion). For this reason, the two linkers in question are treated in § 3.5.3.1
(p. 250) apart form all the others. That section also includes the purposive elements
=p- and =ua. There is, however, no syntactic evidence for the latter two as
subordinating and their grouping with the aforementioned subordinating linkers is
based on their similar semantics.
Several of the clause linkers can be combined. § 8.2.1.1 (p. 478) briefly discusses
the most common combinations.",[503]
"7.7.3.3 Imperative particles
Two clausal clitics, =uai and =elo, have been found to mark imperatives. They are
discussed in § 7.7.3.3.1 (p. 449) and § 7.7.3.3.2 (p. 450), respectively. Again, these
constructions appear very rarely in the recorded corpus, for which reason I dispense
with intonation curves.7.7.3.3.1 =uai on imperatives
=uai on imperatives appears to be the same element that marks questions (§ 7.7.2.1,
p. 438) and is used by some speakers on declaratives as well (see § 7.7.1, p. 435). It
is thus a very multifunctional device. If cliticised to the right end of an imperative, it
serves to make the imperative more polite; in fact, one speaker characterised (140)
as closer to a request than an order.",[474]

simply juxtaposed, as shown in (143).",[339]

as a normal SV sentence, where the subject is a headless relative clause ei ena mutu
heke ‘(the person who) is angry with you’. Right-dislocation is thus a very marginal
phenomenon rather than a pervasive pattern and will not be discussed any further.

9.2.2 The insertion focus construction
The default focus is on the non-subject argument or the whole of the VP, with no
special construction or marking. There is, however, one specific construction to
mark foci. In this construction, a sentence with an empty position is directly
followed by the same (or a very similar) sentence where the previously omitted
constituent is inserted as the focus. The resulting structure somewhat resembles a
question word interrogative (§ 7.7.2.2, p. 443), which includes a variable to be filled
in the answer. Two examples are given in (26) and (27), with the empty position in
the first sentence marked by Ø.(26)     …Ø la’a=ni       ko-horu=ni        fuli-lafu’=ana       ani=ni ko-horu

         near:RED-V2DEM:RED-stand.SG
         ‘Following that, what is standing near the rock is a horse.’     (fisquest35)As a matter of fact, this construction quite precisely implements the definition of
focus as given by Lambrecht (1996: 213) as “[t]he semantic component of a
pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs from the
presupposition”: it gives an open proposition with an empty position, which is then
filled. Note that in both of the illustrated cases, these foci are subjects, which are
preferentially interpreted as topics. It is possible that this marked mapping of
pragmatic relations on grammatical relations causes the focus to be expressed in this
specific construction. However, it is overall quite rare.","[524, 525]"
"
5.1 The head
The only obligatory element of the VP is the predicate, which is thus analysed as its
head. The VP differs in this respect from the NP, in which the head is not obligatory
(§ 4.1, p. 273). The prototypical predicate is a verb (see § 3.2, p. 125, for
information on that lexical category). However, basically any content word can
function as a predicate. § 3.1.1 (p. 100) points out the basic meaning correspondence
between lexemes classified as nouns if used in argument function as opposed to their
use in predicate function. There is one construction, found with verbs of movement
and their goals, which suggests even place names can take this function. The
construction in question is discussed in § 3.1.3.1.2 (p. 111). This functional
flexibility is one of the main reasons for the difficulty to determine lexical categories
in Makalero.
Prototypical verbal predicates are illustrated in (4) and (5) above. (6) exemplifies a
simple noun in predicate function. (7), for comparison, shows the same noun in
argument function. (8) shows a full NP, consisting of a head noun, a modifier and a
determiner, in predicate function. (9) shows an equivalent NP in argument function

associated with nouns and verbs, respectively. A particularly clear example is the
deictic paradigm (§ 3.2.3.9, p. 180 and § 3.3.2.1, p. 232), which includes nominal
and verbal forms. However, most of these processes are of limited productivity, and
there is a large number of content words which are never used with any derivation.
A working definition of the main lexical categories based on other than
morphological criteria, which can capture these, is thus needed in order to make
generalisations over lexemes belonging to these classes possible.
Haspelmath (2001: 16543) points out that, despite the above-mentioned problems, it
is generally possible to categorise word forms into nouns and verbs in individual
languages. As an example, he gives the word fōma’i ‘doctor’ in Samoan (ibid.),
which can be translated both as ‘doctor’ and ‘being a doctor’. This contrasts with
alu, which translates as ‘go’ and the ‘fact of going’, rather than ‘person who goes’
(ibid.). The former would be categorised as a noun, while the latter is a verb. Such
semantic correspondences can be used in the determination of word classes,
alongside morphological processes, if present, as well as syntactic characteristics.
In the following, I will use a combination of such semantic features as used by
Haspelmath (2001) as well as specific morphological alternations and derivations for
the purpose of distinguishing lexical categories in Makalero. Content words are
classified as belonging to one of the open lexical classes of nouns or verbs. § 3.1
(p. 99) discusses nouns, giving a tentative definition and distinguishing a number of
subgroups based on phonological, morphological and syntactic criteria. § 3.2
(p. 125) proceeds analogously with verbs. Most function words are particles or
affixes that are associated with either the noun phrase or the verb phrase, or clitics
attached on phrase-level. These closed-category items contrast with the open
categories noun and verb in that they do not participate in the functional flexibility
exhibited by those classes. § 3.3 (p. 217) treats closed categories associated with the
noun phrase, while those discussed in § 3.4 (p. 241) are associated with the verb
phrase. § 3.5 (p. 243) introduces a variety of phrase-level clitic. Finally, § 3.6
(p. 264) elaborates on some unclear cases.","[123, 124]"
"
 1.6.4 The noun phrase
The noun phrase in Makalero is relatively straightforward. The head noun is
preceded by a possessive phrase, while all other dependents (i.e. modifiers and
determiners) follow it. Most variation is found in the domain of the modifier, which
may be nominal, verbal, or fully clausal. As well as unmarked modifiers, there are
modifiers introduced by the clitic attributive marker ki=. These are generally
contrasting the referent in question with other possible referents with respect to the
quality they express (§ 4.3.4, p. 284). There are, furthermore, genuine relative
sentences18 in Makalero. The marking of these is centred on the subject of the
relative clause, be it the head of the modifier or within the modifier. In the latter
case, the head noun may be marked additionally. This results in a combination of

     They are called relative sentences rather than relative clauses because they may be multiclausal.

head-marking and dependent-marking patterns. The head of a relative sentence may
be either left-dislocated or in situ.","[47, 48]"

ending (§ 3.2.2.1.1, p. 128). More evidence to support the idea of interrogatives
being verbal comes from the fact that tau’ ‘where’ and taure’ ‘which’ have reduced
forms, lacking the final glottal phoneme, for use in complement-verb complexes.
This has been taken in § 3.2.2.2.2 (p. 131) as a clear indicator of verbal status.

SOV languages. In Makalero, too, the VP is consistently head-final, such that
postverbal complement clause extensions as in (486) through (488) are somewhat
unexpected.
Complement clauses of the structure as in (494) look like prototypical argument uses
of clausal constituents, provided they use either the demonstrative ere or the definite

construction. As discussed above, however, it is not quite easy to reconcile =e’,
which seems to be verbal in origin, with this picture. Note, however, the similarity
with the derived deictic verbs discussed in § 3.2.3.9.1 (p. 183). Ere’ and the other
members of this paradigm are predominantely used to recapitulate longish
undergoers. In these occurrences, the verbs in question look like determiners.
However, there is clear evidence showing that they are verbal. It is telling that the
form =e’ found with some clausal arguments is identical to the verbal ending of
such derived demonstrative verbs; it is plausible to assume that the element =e’ is
used in such cases in a function very much like that of the derived deictic verbs as
described in § 3.2.3.9.1 (p. 183).
Postverbal complement clause extensions and the use of the complementiser on the
matrix clause are typologically unexpected. However, sentences such as (495) and
(496) provide some insight in the origin of this construction type. In both of them,
the end of the complement clause extension is marked by the quotative marker ain

With semantically transitive verbs, verbal complements have been shown to be
mutually exclusive with objects. This suggests that they both function as arguments
to a given verb and stand in the same functional position opened by the verb. The
fact that semantically intransitive verbs as tia ‘sleep’ and iri’ ‘urinate’, which which
are not associated with an undergoer, can stand with verbal complements, as in
(120) and (122) respectively, shows that these verbs are associated with a second
syntactic argument position next to that of the subject, just like the transitive verbs in
(115) through (118) above are. Syntactically, thus, there is no difference between
semantically transitive and intransitive verbs; both types are associated with two
syntactic argument positions. The difference between the two lies merely in the
nature of the second argument compatible with a given verb: in the case of such
verbs as pase ‘beat’ and heil ‘pull’, the functional argument position can be filled by
either an object or a complement, while verbs such as tia ‘sleep’ and iri’ ‘urinate’
are not compatible with objects. The only possible filler for the argument position in
question with these verbs is a complement.
To sum up, with the exception of the relatively small class of avalent verbs
(§ 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141), any verb is syntactically divalent and takes a subject argument
and a non-subject argument, which can be either in the form of an object or a
complement. The semantic participant frame associated with a given verb
determines which syntactic kind of arguments it is compatible with. Semantically
transitive verbs have an undergoer in their participant frame. On the syntactic level,
these are most commonly associated with object arguments, but may also take
complements. Semantically intransitive verbs, on the other hand, are not associated
with an undergoer. Syntactically, they may take a complement, but never an object
argument.","[169, 170]"

   Hau is also read as a superlative with predicatively used nouns. In terms of aktionsart, thus, these
predicates are stative. This is consistent with their semantics as denoting a property (§ 3.1.1, p. 100)
rather than an action. In the example in (ix), noko ‘younger sibling’ functions as a predicate within the
modifier position of the NP (§ 4, p. 273), headed in this case by the same lexeme in argument use.(ix)      … asi-noko                  hau          noko            umu...

A last characteristic of stative verbs as opposed to activity verbs is the fact that the
verbs leto- ‘through’ and seti- ‘pass’ are read as comparatives. The construction in
question is a complement-verb complex with the stative verb as the main verb and
either leto- ‘through’ or seti- ‘pass’ as the complement verb (§ 5.2.2.2, p. 326). (148)
and (149) show two such constructions.","[177, 178]"
"5.2.2.1.1 Locations and goals
The largest group of nominals found in complement position are those expressing
goals or locations. This includes both common nouns, such as lopu ‘house’ or mu’a
‘ground’ in (14) and (15), and toponyms, such as Dili in (16). The position of verbal
modifiers relative to these arguments, which they precede, makes clear that the
arguments in question stand in the complement slot. For comparison, refer to (11)
and (12) in § 5.2.1 (p. 319) above with object arguments, which are followed by the
verbal modifiers. Whilst most nominal complements are made up of simple nouns,
as in (14) and (16), note that they can also be full NPs, as shown by the complement
in (14), where lopu ‘house’ is accompanied by the reflexive possessive pronoun ni-
(§ 3.3.1.2, p. 227).",[346]

very long and complex subject NPs. In these cases, =ini could be said to function as
a boundary marker showing the right end of the subject NP to facilitate the
processing of the sentence by the hearer. Examples with such complex subject NPs
are given in (28) and (29), where square brackets indicate the extent of the NPs in
question. In (28), the subject’s head noun mataniki ‘children’ is accompanied by a
lengthy verbal modifier tafi-tafi hau rial ‘really very many’; similarly, in (29), the
head noko ‘younger sibling’ stands with a verbal modifier. This particular case is
complicated by the fact that the nominal predicate of this modifier is actually
identical to the head noun itself. The processing of both of these sentences is
significantly facilitated through the presence of the subject marker =ini.",[415]

 8. The utterance
An utterance is an actual instance of language in use. It is often made up of one or
more clausal units, but not necessarily so (see Payne 1997: 378, fn 1: “propositions
are not always expressed in the form of clauses, but also frequently in shorter
linguistic forms, such as phrases, interjections, or incomplete structures”). An
utterance is commonly defined as a “stretch of speech preceded and followed by
silence or a change of speaker” (Crystal 1991: 367). A potentially problematic
aspect of this definition (ibid.) is that the term thus comprises a wide variety of
speech units, ranging from one-word answers to complete sermons. A more
serviceable definition is given in Staden (2000: 207): an utterance is a “language
product, bounded by a final intonation contour” 191. Though some utterances under
this definition are still rather lengthy, it generally yields much more manageable
chunks of speech and is thus appropriated in the present work. The final intonation
contour of a declarative, shown in Figure 8.1 (repeated from Figure 7.1 above), is
distinctly falling and in clear contrast with the rising intonation of a declarative in
the middle of an utterance. For comparison, the bracketed clause in (2) and the
corresponding pitch contour in Figure 8.2 give an example of the latter (for
intonation contours of other sentence types, see § 7.7, p. 435).","[477, 478]"

to it.
Full clauses can also stand in the LDP to supply adverbial information to the main
clause or sentence. The adverbial clauses in question are cliticised with a form of the
complementiser, whose function in these cases seems to be a more general
subordinating one, marking the clausal unit it is attached to as a constituent within a
sentence (see § 7.6.1.1, p. 430). Two examples are given in (108) and (109). Such
adverbial clauses are equivalent to topic NPs, which are also commonly found in the
left-detached position of the sentence. Such topics in the LDP may either be
arguments of the following clause or not.",[509]
"3.2.3.10 Verbs with complement clause extensions
A number of verbs in Makalero are commonly found with postverbal clausal
extensions. These extensions may consist of single clauses, but also multi-clause
units (i.e. sentences, see § 7, p. 401). All of these verbs are found in a construction
where the clausal extension follows the main verb in a coordinated construction.
These clausal extensions, called complement clause extensions in the following, are
not to be confused with the complements which are an instantiation of the non-
subject argument in the clause, as opposed to objects (§ 5.2, p. 319). Their syntactic
status is not straightforward. Some constructions suggest that they are not arguments
of the verb (§ 3.2.3.10.1.2, p. 189). On the other hand, some verbs allow for an
alternative construction which involves a nominalised clause equivalent to the
complement clause extension in the preverbal object position. In this case, it clearly
is an argument of the verb. § 8.3.5 (p. 485) gives some more discussion on the
syntactic status of complement clause extensions. On the basis of the variant
constructions that are possible with them, the verbs in question are classified into
distinct groups. The major division is between verbs of saying and modal verbs; the
former are discussed in § 3.2.3.10.1 (p. 187), the latter in § 3.2.3.10.2 (p. 193).

Not all verbs included in this section are in fact verbs of saying; however, this
semantic heading covers a significant portion of them. Verbs of saying fall in three
separate groups. The first of these, discussed in § 3.2.3.10.1.1 (p. 187), consists of
verbs which have the possiblity of introducing the complement clause extension
with the complementiser =ee ~ =e’ ~ =ere. Neither of the verb classes treated in
§ 3.2.3.10.1.2 (p. 189) and § 3.2.3.10.1.3 (p. 191) are found with the
complementiser. Those discussed in § 3.2.3.10.1.2 (p. 189) generally use a clause
linker, while those in § 3.2.3.10.1.3 (p. 191) are found in paratactic linkage only. All
of these verbs allow for the expression of an NP equivalent to the complement
clause extension in object position. This suggests that there is some syntactic
interdependence between the verb of saying and a following complement clause
extension. The issue is discussed in more detail in § 8.3.5 (p. 485).
The clearest representatives of verbs with postverbal complement clause extensions
are those given in Table 3.30. All of these can be constructed either with preverbal
nominal argument or with a postverbal complement clause extension.","[211, 212]"

however, that the second change of speaker in (39), following the question rau ere

semantically based; group I involves verbs expressing necessity, group II verbs
expressing volition or lack thereof, and group III consists of a variety of verbs
associated with possibility, both internal (as with ‘can’ and ‘cannot’), and externally
imposed (as with ‘not allowed’). Group IV, finally, consists of only one verb; the
question of the internal semantic consistency of the group is thus moot.
The modal verbs of group I are only found in such multi-clause sentences as
exemplified in (67) through (69). Those in group II, on the other hand, allow for the
expression of the modifed proposition in the form of an object argument. In this
case, the modal verb clearly heads the structure. (70) and (71) give examples.","[447, 448]"

determiner could possibly stand directly after the head noun, since the determiner

an interpretation of the ki=-phrase as distinct from the noun phrase in question,
either as a separate noun phrase on its own or a predicate, as appropriate in the
context (see (52) above).
Note also that noun phrases with a ki=-attribute and noun phrases with a bare verb
in the modifier slot are used in a parallel way in clauses of identical structure, as in
292                                           CHAPTER 4
