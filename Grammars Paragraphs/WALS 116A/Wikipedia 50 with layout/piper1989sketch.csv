"5.5.1 Interrogatives.
      There are two types of interrogatives in the language. One type for polar
questions and another type for non-polar questions.
      Polar questions have the same form as declaratives but with rising
intonation at the end of the utterance to indicate a question:
(S.64) ma- y       kari-m paret dirup- o?
        2SgA-Deix lSg- All dirt sweep-Fut2/3
        'Will you sweep for me?'
(S.65) ma suga        dikri- o?
        2SgA <EngO throw-Fut2/3
        'Have you put in sugar?
       Non-polar questions require an interrogative pronoun or clitic inserted at
the beginning of the utterance. The form of the interrogative depends on what is
being questioned (see the section on Interrogative Pronouns, p72). Although
these typically occur at the beginning, they can follow a pronoun:
(S.66) ma nalu ike-li?
         2SgA whatO do- Prlmpf
         'What are you doing?'",[203]
"                                                                        192
            The attention getting particle aka 'hey!' is often inserted at the beginning
     of an utterance such as a question to attract the addressee's attention:
     (5.67) (aka) ma- y         idim-     ge bakyamu- 0           awgog- em?
              hey 2SgS-Deix morning-Loe Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 big climb-All
              '(Hey,) are you going up to the top of the hill tomorrow?
     (5.68) aka ka ge- ka ut              na- ydi-            lu      able uteb- ge?
              hey lSgS Deix-lSgS sleep Futl-n PIS lie down-FutlSg Det place-Loe
              'Hey, will I sleep here at this place?
            There is a particle -aw which is cliticised onto the last word in the sentence.
     It operates like a tag question asking for confirmation or just checking to see
     whether the speaker has the addressee's attention:
     (5.69) ma kcira mir asor- 0-                  aw?
              2SgA lSgGen word listen-Fut2/3-tag
               'You will listen to what I am saying, won't you?'
     (5.70) e       no teb+teb        baka-aw?
              3SgS Restr alone Adj go- tag
               'He went on his own, didn't he?'
            There is also a vocative suffix -oy affixed to a proper noun when the person
     being addressed is distant or non-visible. When the person is close-by, no marker
     is used:
     (5.71) Kosir-oy 'hey Kosir!'
              Warib-oy 'hey W arib!'
              Eydyana-oy 'hey Eidiana!'
              ?Pomoy-oy 'hey Pomoy!'
            Examples need to be collected to see whether this suffix can be used when
     kinship terms or common nouns are used for address forms:
            ?ama-oy        'hey mother!'
            ?berbet-oy 'hey sibling!'
            ?nap-oy        'hey grandchild!'
            ?kerim le-oy 'hey boss!'
            It can also be used with interrogative pronouns where the forms will differ
     depending on whether what is being questioned is animate (-oy) or inanimate
     (-ay): e.g. nete-oy 'who?'; nalu(w)-ay 'what?'

 '     5.5.2 Imperatives.
           As we saw earlier in the section on temporal/ aspectual morphology, there
     is no distinction between the future and the imperative for 2nd person. The
     same form of the verb is used for both functions. However, the pronoun can be
     omitted when it is being used with an imperative function:
                                                                                 193
(5.72)  wapum+wapum ero-0
        slow Intens?      eat-Fut2/3
        'Eat slowly.'
(5.73) able      erw-am
        Det N? eat- Fut2/3Dual
        'Eat this (you two).'
      When it is a negative imperative, the verb can be used in its nominal form
with the privative suffix:
(5.74) nole ero-0              nole aro- kak
        Neg eat-Fut2/3         Neg eatN-Priv
        'Don't eat it.'
      Note, however, that the privative nominal is actually ambiguous for the
utterance could be interpreted as '(It's) inedible' although there is a different
intonation for each.","[203, 204, 205]"
"Interrogative/Indefinite Pronouns.
      There is a set of interrogative words used with non-polar questions such as
nete 'who', netim 'to who, for who', nade 'when, where', nalug-lam 'why, from
what', etc. Within this set are included: nade 'when, where~ which is used to
introduce a temporal or spatial adverbial clause, and nako 'what (to do)~ which is
used to introduce an activity clause. Interrogative words follow a case marking
pattern similar to nouns, an ergative-absolutive pattern, i.e. A versus S/O for
non-humans, and a three way split, i.e. A, S and 0 for humans.
      The interrogative/indefinite pronominal paradigm is as follows:
                                nete 'who'        nalu 'what'
A                               net-ide           nalug-ide
s                               nete              nalu (... nalulu)
0                               neti
Locative                        neti-doge         nalug-e
Allative                        neti-m            nalug-em
Ablative                        neti-alam         nalug-lam
Genitive                        neti-ra           nalug-ira
Associative                     neti-pkem
Instrumental                                      nalug-u     Some of the interrogative words cannot be broken down into morphemes
and must be listed in the lexicon. These include:
      nete 'who'
      nade 'when, where'
      nako 'what'
     Other words are formed by the interrogative proclitic na-. For example:
      na-lu 'what' (lit: Q clitic-thing)
      na-ged-ge 'where' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-Loe)
      na-ged-im (-nagadim) 'where to' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-All)
      na-nyay+nyay 'how long (in time)' (lit: Q clitic-time N)
      na-war-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-length of time-Loe)
      na-kerker-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-point in time-Loe)
      na-piri 'how long (in space)' (lit: Q clitic-length)
      na-urut-ge 'what year' (lit: Q clitic-year-Loc)
                                                                           72
       Interrogative pronouns typically occur at the beginning of a sentence or
immediately following a sentence-initial pronoun. Examples to illustrate
interrogatives, their position and their inflections follow:
(2.260) net- ide keriba            lewer ays-          li?
         who-A ln SgExclGen foodO carry Pauc/PlO-Primpf
         'Who is taking our food?' (D6pem, p217, section13)
(2.261) nako mara ney dike-                      redi?
         whats 2SgGen name n PIS be(name)-Pr
         'What is your name?'
(2.262) neti able koskir-               ide dasmer-i?
         whoO Det (married)female-A see-           Pf
         'Who did the woman see?'
(2.263) e       na-     lug- u       abi ipit-i?
         3SgA Q clitic-thing-Instr 3Sg0 hit- Pf
          'What did he hit him with?'
        There is no distinction between A, S or 0 for nonsingular interrogative
pronouns. Thus:
        neti-de       'who A (Sg)'
        nete          'who S (Sg)'
        neti          'who 0 (Sg)'
        net-iba       'who A/S/0 (n Sg)'
(2.264) net- iba o-         bakyaw-       are?
         who-n Sg Fut2/3-Pauc/PlS go-Fut2/3Pl
         'Who (pl) is going?'
(2.265) net- iba pe lewer ti- dikasr-eyey?
         who-n Sg Deix foodO Deix-cook- PrimpfDual
         'Which two are cooking the food?'
(2.266) ?ma net- iba da-ra-              smer-da?
           2SgA who-n Sg I -3n SgO- I see- P£Pl
          'Which people did you see?'
        The interrogative pronoun with the ergative plural case marking does not
exist, i.e. *nete-gize. However, the interrogative word formed by the question
clitic and the word le 'person' does have an A plural form and an S plural form
(the plural S form is not acceptable to all speakers):
(2.267) na-       le-     lut? (\el\..\t:.1fre~ular-{ormof le.''pef""Son'+et~68A"")
        Q clitic-person-SgA
        'who A (sg)?'
(2.268) na-     le-     gize?
        Q clitic-person-plA
        'who A (pl)?'","[83, 84]"
"                                                                            35

          3SgS fear- Loe n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
          'He is scared.'
        The locative case is also used in an idiomatic expression suffixed to an
animate noun to indicate that a situation or decision is dependent upon the
person in question:
(The example was collected with a pronominal form but a nominal could be
substituted).
(2.28) kemer+kemer kerker mari-doge nagri
          all Adj            time 2Sg- Loe PIS be(thing)
          'The times are up to you.'
        (i.e it's all up to you as to how often and how long we work)
(It is unclear what the case inflection is for the adverbial temporal phrase.)
        The Locative case is also used to mark specific points in time:
(2.29) emeret-             ge
          former time -Loe
          'a long time ago'
(2.30) ab-          gerger-ge
          former-day - Loe
          'yesterday'
(2.31) idim-           ge
          morning-Loe
          'in the morning, tomorrow'
(2.32) mayk-e
          close- Loe
          'soon, nearby, close'
        There are also morphophonological alternations:
-ge--> -e I c [+velar stop] -         ex. mayk-e 'with/at the widow's place'
         -ge I elsewhere              ex. we-ge 'on the beach'
-idog(e) --> -ydoge I V-              ex. ama-ydoge 'with/ at mother's place'
               -0       I y-          ex. Pomoy -doge 'with/ at Pomoy's place'
               -idoge I elsewhere ex. Lez-idoge 'with/ at Les' place'
Note that the presence or absence of the final vowel in the inflection -idog(e) is in
free variation.","[46, 47]"
"      Meryam Mir is a Papuan language spoken in the Torres Strait, that stretch
of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It has an A-0-V
or S-V word order and an agglutinating morphology. Case inflections are
suffixed to nominals to mark their syntactic role in the clause. Markers cross-
referencing the syntactic arguments of the clause are affixed to the verb indicating
number and, to some degree, person. In typological terms, the language can be
regarded as a double-marking language.
      The following study is a sketch grammar of the language. Chapter 1 deals
with the phonology. Chapter 2 examines briefly the different word classes and
nominal morphology. Chapter 3 looks at verbals and their morphology. In
Chapter 4, the system of deictic markers is presented outlining some of its
functions and meanings. In Chapter 5, basic features of the syntax are outlined.

Acknowledgements.
       There are many people who must be thanked for their help. First and
foremost is the Murray Island Council who permitted me to come and live on
their island. All the people on Murray made me feel so welcome and I found
many new friends. I really need to thank everyone, from all the villages, from
Webok to Babud. Each and everyone contributed in one way or another and
taught me so much with diligence, patience and humour. The teaching sessions
often did not happen in formal sessions but when I was going for walks, at the
shops, having cups of tea, camping or picnicing at Dawar, spending time in
people's homes. To all those people, thank-you. To Les Saleee, his wife,
Maryann (Kosir), and their children, Galiga and Kinor, whom I lived with for all
those months and who became my dear family, thank-you. To all my other
relatives at Dew, thank-you. A special thanks to Tapim Binifather, Gamalai Passi
and Kathleen Salee who gave up their time to answer all my nit-picking queries,
helped me decipher texts and taught me more about their language. I would also
like to thank all those that allowed me to record stories: Henry Kaberi, Gracie
Barsa, Kaba Noah and his wife, James Rice, Eidiana Tabo, Meb Salee, Sam Passi

        I would also like to thank my supervisors, Professor Dixon and Dr. Koch,
for all their helpful comments. My gratitude to all my friends, the 'Four
Muskateers', Felix 'Mangro' Ameka, Andy 'Slippery' Butcher, Ian 'Perv' Green
 and Nick 'Tufty' Reid as well as Yoshiko Sheard and my dearest friend Fran~oise
Dussart for all their support and assistance. There are too many to thank
individually but each one helped and encouraged me. Finally, to my family, all
my thanks and to Dotty, for making this last year very special.

       There is often no space bar between one morpheme and the next. This has
been done in order to save on the length of gloss in relation to language examples
cited directly above. However, the beginning of a morpheme can always be
established as it will either be in italics or it will begin with a capital letter;

       Contrast 2.274 where the pronominal is indefinite with the following

        (Dewmer, p211, section18)
       A few examples have been collected with the interrogative pronoun
nalulu:

         'Why is he so happy?'
       Informants have said nalulu is the same as nalu 'what O'. However, the
English gloss might be better captured by 'what kind of X', i.e. what kind of thing
did they get up to yesterday at Dew? What kind of happiness is he feeling? (i.e.
what is the cause?). In other words, nalulu may be the interrogative word used
for asking information about a component of a compound. In order to verify this
claim, questions need to be elicited of the type:
What kind of hair does he have?
What type of house does he live in?
What kind of bananas do you grow? etc.","[84, 85, 86]"
"Irrealis Non-committal.
       This marker is used for events where their realisation or continuation is
uncertain. It is also used sometimes by speakers to be polite, not wishing to
assume that an event, involving the addressee, definitely will (continue to)
happen. It is restricted to events with 2nd or 3rd person participants since these
are potentially less certain than events with the speaker, i.e. 1st person, which are
more certain (at least from the speaker's point of view) and cannot carry an
irrealis non-committal mood. When this mood is used, there is often an
additional component of desire on behalf of the speaker or of someone else in
wanting the event to (continue to) happen and that the event will be good.
       Consider the following examples contrasting future with irrealis:
(3.129) debe le                nole inner-kak wa- yrdi
         good person/ones Neg rain- Priv Fut3-n PIS be(time,place)

         'It will be good with no rain for the tombstone opening.'

         good person/ oneS Neg rain- Priv Fut3-n PIS be(time, place)
         daw-                (w)a able kerim bakir awskir- em
         n PIS be(person?)-Irr Det head stone open N- All
         'I hope that it will not rain for the tombstone opening.'
         (translation given by the speaker)
(3.131) ma ut na-                wpe       daw-    o
         2SgS sleep 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS lien PIS be-Fut2/3
         'Remain sleeping.'
(3.132) ma ut         na-        wpe       daw- (w)a
         2SgS sleep 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS lien PIS be-Irr
         'Could you please remain asleep.'
       In these examples, there is a contrast between the future (3.129 and 3.131)
and irrealis (3.130 and 3.132) with regard to the speaker's attitude. In the irrealis,
the speaker indicates his/her desire for the event to happen or continue
happening. In 3.132, the irrealis indicates the speaker's desire to be polite in not                                                                             115
wanting to say whether the event will happen or not although it is dear from the
context that the speaker wants the event to happen and thinks it will be good.
The irrealis examples can be tentatively explicated as follows:
               I don't want to say it will happen/ go on happening
               I don't want to say it won't happen/won't go on happening
               I can't do it or stop it happening
               (I want- you want- other people want something)
               (I think- you think- other people think it will be good)
       In some examples, the event is both desired by and beneficial to the
speaker:

         'If I am not awake (when) 3 o'clock strikes, then you should wake me up.'
       In some examples, the event is desired only by the speaker but beneficial to
the addressee:

         'Stand clear of me in case of something going wrong.'
         (This was said by someone about to chop down a tree to warn the person
         to stay clear in case the blade might fly off.)
(3.135) ese ma idim-           ge baka, ma baka lu            imu-        wa,

          'If you go in the morning, go and should you strike something which

          (This example was said by an old woman to someone in their dream to
          help them find the right bit of wood.)
        In some examples, the event is neither beneficial nor desired by the speaker
or addressee but by another person (such as in the phrase below ese legize mari
bawru onaskawem 'if people should try and spear you' where the spearing is
desired and would benefit only the spearers, not the speaker nor addressee):
(3.136) ma baka baraygi-o              ge na-            w-             (w)a karem- ge

        ese le-      gize mari bawr-u        o- na-      sk-   awem,

         'Go, dive in (and) stay there in the deep sea. H people should try to spear

         (This was said by a mother to her child urging him to dive into the water
         and break the spears of those who try and spear him.)
       In the following example, the event is neither beneficial nor desirable for
the speaker, only for the addressee:
(3.137) wa        na- lug- lam
         2n SgS Qclitic-thing-Abl
         wa      baka lar dipomde daw-                   (w)a?
         2n SgS go fishO feel           n Pl?S be(person)-Irr
         'Why should you go fondling the fish?'
         (where the speaker is addressing a group of women that he asked to help
         him cook a fish but does not want them to know that the fish is a young
       boy)
       In this example, the irrealis marker is used as a kind of warning. The
speaker does not want to say that the event is happening and so, he uses the
irrealis marker. This illustrates another important feature of the irrealis marker.
The irrealis is never used with yes/no questions nor non-polar interrogatives as
the presupposition in the speaker's mind is that something will happen or is
happening. Thus, below, in 3.138, the speaker assumes the addressee is staying
for a while and is asking for more information about the period of the stay. It
would be inappropriate to use the irrealis marker suggesting that the addressee
was not staying. Similarly in the other example below, 3.139, the speaker must be
thinking that there is some suggestion or possibility that the addressee will be
staying and so the irrealis marker would imply the converse:
(3.138) ma na-        nyay+nyay i         n-        aw-              0     Mer-ge?
         2SgS Q clitic-long time N Deix 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Fut2/3 M.- Loe
         'How long will you be staying on Murray Island?'
         *ma na-nyay+nyay i n-aw-(w)a Mer-ge?
(3.139) aka ma i         n-         aw-              0      Mer-ge?
         hey 2SgS Deix 1/2Sg/P1S-n PIS be(person)-Fut2/3 M.- Loe
         'Will you be staying on Murray Island?'
         *aka ma i n-aw-(w)a Mer-ge?
        When the irrealis marker is used with reference to 2nd person, it is
frequently used as a politeness form. Speakers often explain such sentences as the
speaker giving permission to the addressee, i.e. any time you like do it. It is
 probably for this reason that the irrealis marker has been described by Ray as the                                                                            117
form of the imperative used when the speaker will be absent. When it is being
used as a form of politeness, the time reference is not specified for the immediate
and hence interpretation of its meaning in terms of the speaker's absence is
plausible and accounted for. Here are some examples of its use as a politeness
form:
(3.140) ma mena n-             aw-               (w)a
         2SgS still 1/2Sg/PIS-n PIS be(person)-Irr
         'Do stay here/ You should stay longer/ You could stay longer.'
         (often used by speakers as a polite way of bidding farewell)
(3.141) ma na-           mi              da-                wa
         2SgS 1 /2Sg/PIS-n PIS be sitting n PIS be(person)-Irr
         'Do stay seated.'
(3.142) ma marl ged- ge n-                  aw-              (w)a,

         'Should you be (back) in your country, could you send (us) your good
         thoughts.'
       A feature of the irrealis marker which warrants further investigation is the
frequent occurrence with conditional sentences, both in the condition and the
consequent. Is the irrealis marker used to indicate a lesser degree of certainty? Is
it used to indicate an overt lack of commitment to its realisation on behalf of the
speaker? If one compares sentences with and without the irrealis, the contrast lies
in the degree of certainty of the events:

       The incompatibility of the temporal phrase marker nade 'when' and the
irrealis noncommittal suggests it does indeed carry a lesser degree of certainty. It
may also be suggesting that the speaker does not want to say whether something
will happen or not. This interpretation of the irrealis noncommittal is supported
by non-conditional sentences with 3rd person where the irrealis noncommittal
marker indicates that the speaker will not say whether something will happen or
not:                                                                          118

"Arguments for considering the glides as underlying consonants.
(i)    There are only sequences of vowel plus glides or glides plus vowels within
the one syllable. Other vowel sequences always occur over two syllables with a
glide intervening although it may not be very prominant, e.g. kayed
'grandparent', keyar 'crayfish', eyu 'type of grass', iyu 'tears Instr', Mowa 'island
name'. Phonotactically, the glide occurs in a position typically occupied by a
consonant and thus, could be regarded as part of the consonant system.
(ii)   With some lexemes, there are examples of two glides and a vowel within
the one syllable:
       syaw 'sneeze'
       bway 'kinspeople'
       way 'seed inside the coconut'
       yey 'large blind shark'
       waw 'yes, hole'
       If glides are analysed as underlying vowels, then an account must be made
in the phonotactics of a possible sequence of three vowels- a somewhat unusual
phenomenon amongst languages of the world. If, however, the glides are
analysed as underlying consonants, then a sequence eve can be hypothesized- a
pattern which can be found elsewhere in the language.
       The analysis of glides as consonants will still require further specification
in the phonotactic outline of the language because the only clusters that are
permitted word initially are those of a consonant plus glide type.
(iii)  Glides will have to be postulated to account for their use across morpheme
boundaries:
       tutu-em-tutuw-em 'type of doll-all'
       ,     ,
       1-u-1y-u   'tears-ms
                         • tr
                           I
       6+o-6w+o 'courageous' (lit: liver+liver)
       le-em-ley-em-le-m 'person-all'       The decision as to whether glides are part of the consonant system or part
of the vowel system cannot be made at this stage of the analysis. More data and
evidence needs to be collected. In this analysis, glides will be presented as part of
the consonant system although this is only tentative.",[24]
"Exclamations/Interjections.
       Within this class of words are items which have no syntactic value and
which can occur as a complete utterance. Examples include waw 'yes', nole 'no',
way (-wey) 'alas, poor one, dear one', megiyem 'yuk' (lit: vomit-All), mayem
'welcome', erarem 'boring' (lit: tired-All), akame-akasi 'to express surprise,
incredulity', no bes mimi 'see you later' (lit: Restr lie wander), baru 'okay'. Items
in this class need not belong exclusively to this class. Thus, an item such as menaJ
which was discussed earlier as an adverb meaning 'keep on, remaining still', may
also be used as an interjection meaning 'hang on, wait'. This class will not be
discussed further.",[42]

"Arguments for considering the glides as underlying vowels:
(i)     There is a speech style called nasnas mir 'sorry talk' which is used by the
speaker to convey sympathy I grief for the topic (which might also be the
addressee). The phonetic change that takes place only affects verbs and more
specifically the initial vowel or vowel plus glide sequence in the verb. If the
initial vowel is /a/, then a glide /w/ is prefixed to it. If it is any other vowel or
vowel plus glide, these are deleted and a back vowel /u/, /o/ or /w/ is inserted:
                                                                               10
#V[ +high,+front] C V[ +high,+front] ----> #u C V[+high,+front]
#(C) a                                   ---> #(C) wa
elsewhere                                -----> #(C) o
For example:
        da-li        ---->        dwali 'n PIS be(person) Primpf'
        digem        ---->        dogem 'walk'
        er6          ---->        or6 'eat'
        iri          ---->        uri 'smoke, drink'
        When there is a vowel plus glide sequence, both phones are deleted and
replaced by a back vowel:
        ewpamaret------> 6pamaret 'jump'
        This provides some evidence that these are underlying vowels for the fact
is that the replacement by the vowel affects both vowel and glide if there is one.
This suggests that glides could be part of the vowel system as rules affecting
vowels also affect them.
        On the other hand, it is generally regarded that glides do share features in
common with vowels and hence their frequent label as semi-vowels. The above
phonetic changes can simply be regarded as evidence of features in common
between vowels and glides.
(ii)    There is an example of a word that has the sequence glide plus vowel and
when it is abbreviated, the glide becomes syllabic which suggests it must be
underlyingly a vowel:
        negwam ------>      negu 'cousin'       (i.e. w --> u)
Conversely, one can state the change in terms of a glide becoming syllabic when
there is no other vowel in the syllable.
(iii)   There is morphophonemic evidence that at least some verbs have as their
underlying form a vowel sequence rather than a vowel plus glide sequence:
        b-6s 'pl S be born'
        e-wsmer 'n PIS be born' (i.e. underlyingly eo)
parallel to:
        ba-wm 'pl S die'
        e-wmi 'nonpl s die' (i.e. underlyingly ew)
        The use of the glide symbol in the word ewsmer obscures the
 morphophonemic relationship between the sequence /ew/ and /o/ whereas if
one represents it as a vowel sequence /eo/ (with rules that apply later and
 transform the sequence eo --->ew, the change is more transparent and easier to
 account for. However, the relationship between the two forms is not always as
 clear. If one considers the following examples where the future 1st person is
 marked by the infixation of the vowel I a/, in the first example, i--->aw whilst in
 the second example, i---->ay:
         diski 'open Sg/DualO'                                                                             I I
        dawskilu 'open Sg/DualO Futl'
        dimi 'close Sg/DualO'
        daymilu 'close Sg/DualO Futl'
        Thus, the rule can only be formulated very generally stating that an
accented vowel will become a vowel plus glide sequence when an affix (prefix or
infix) is attached. Is it appropriate to use morphology to prove something in the
domain of phonology? Whilst it is the linguist's task to assemble data from all
areas and assess these in relation to each other, it does not necessarily follow that
an analysis in one area justifies a particular analysis in a different area.
(iv) There are examples in the data where the vowel plus glide sequence
sounds like a complex rather than a single peak; it sounds like two syllables
rather than a single syllable. Examples contrasting single and complex peaks
follow:
        peybri-peibri 'name of a clan, moiety(?)'(3syll) peym 'dream'(lsyll)
        bawr- baur 'spear'(2syll)                            baw 'enter'(lsyll)
        Bewr- Beur 'village name'(2syll)                     Dew 'village name'(lsyll)
        Note that if the examples in the first group were transcribed with the extra
syllable (e.g. eyi), then there could be no claim that the underlying forms were a
monophone vowel sequence as they would represent a sequence of two syllables
with the glide marking a syllable boundary. On the other hand, if these were
transcribed as a single syllable (e.g. eyC), the task would remain to account for
why the first group of words sound different to the second group and if these are
phonetically as opposed to phonemically distinct.
        There are two complex peaks in the following environments:
(i) There is an accented vowel I e/ and palatal glide followed by a voiced
consonant cluster, e.g. peybri [pefuri] 'clan name', eyrsida [eirsida] 'SgS moored
 (Pf)'. Contrast with: neys [neys] 'two', peym [peym] 'dream', deyb [deyb]
 'swelling, mound'.
 (ii) There is a front accented vowel and bilabial glide followed by a consonant,
e.g. ewmida [eumida] 'SgS die (Pf)', gewm [geum] 'fear', iwri [iilri] - ewri [euri]
 'SgS weave (Pf)', newr [neur] 'unmarried female', newd [neud] 'parrot fish',
 ewsmeda [eusmeda] 'SgS come out (Pf)', ewtmer [eutmer] 'ask'. Contrast with:
 new [new] 'ripe', Dew [dew] 'village name'.
 (iii) There is an accented vowel and glide followed by a voiced consonant /r /,
 e.g. toyr [t6ir] 'fat', gayr [gafr] 'many', wawr [waur] 'type of wind', bawr [baur]
 'spear', teyr [tefr] 'decorated'. Contrast with: ays [ays] 'bring Pauc/PlO', Koyti
 [k6yti] 'name of person', waw [waw] 'yes', Bawz [bawz] 'name of village', awmkep
 [awmkep] 'type of cloud', aydir+aydir [aydir+aydir] 'lie Adj'.
      The same data could be examined reaching the conclusion that a vowel
sequence is a valid analysis. Glides do share features with vowels and their
                                                                              12
ability to become syllabic or maybe make the syllable sound longer is a
consequence of one such feature.","[21, 22, 23, 24]"
"                                                                             19
      There are no consonant clusters that can occur word-initially or word-finally
      although as mentioned in the previous section, consonant plus glide clusters can
      occur word-initially, and glide plus consonant clusters can occur word-finally.
             The types of consonant clusters which can occur in word-medial position
      are not restricted and gaps in their occurrence are likely to be due to the paucity of
      data rather than actual restrictions. This apparent freedom in cluster types is the
      result of nouns and verbs formed into complex stems, processes such as
      reduplication and vowel deletion with certain conjugations and affixation of
      certain morphemes. The examples given in the section on syllables indicated
      that an analysis which relies on the occurrence of phoneme sequences alone, i.e.
      a phonotactic study, will fail to predict why some consonant clusters are
      acceptable whilst others are not (such as consonant clusters at word boundaries).
      It was suggested that a closer examination of the internal structure of the syllable
      might be a more profitable way of looking at the data. An alternative approach
      would be to examine whether clusters differ within a word root as opposed to at a
      morpheme boundary. It is not always, however, apparent where the root
      boundaries are.
             This study will restrict itself to giving examples and listing the consonant
      clusters that have been collected.","[30, 31]"

       These examples are illustrative for another reason. The two
morphological categories do not coincide exactly with the semantic categories that
were postulated. Thus, the verb ikasir 'be going along' and the verb esk (< -kos)
'be flowing' are not atelic stative verbs yet behave morphologically with verbs of
this category. There are two possible explanations for these facts. One
explanation is that verbs which are atelic stative in one language such as in
English need not be so in another language such as Meryam Mir. An alternative
explanation is that these categories are essentially morphological categories
which cannot be fully specified on a semantic basis.","[96, 97]"

      When verb roots begin with a consonant andan,unaccented vowel, the

      H the verb root begins with an unaccented vowel only, this vowel is deleted
and the marker is prefixed/infixed (depending on whether one chooses to delete
the vowel first and then prefix the marker or whether one chooses to infix the

       Note that the prefixes are the same forms as those for intransitive atelic
verbs. However, they have singular versus nonsingular number reference for all
persons. Here are some examples to illustrate their use:

       However, the table fails to capture the fact that dual, paucal and plural 0
number can be overtly specified by means of suffixes following the number
hierarchy (see later section on number hierarchy, p132). One can either regard the
prefix as a co-occurring morpheme or as a more general non-singular number
marker. For example:

       When the verb root begins with I di, it cannot be distinguished from the
1/2nd person 0 morpheme which is also d-. In such cases, the pronominal form
will provide the information about the singular or non-singular 0 argument:

        There is an additional pronominal set which functions both as a reflexive/
reciprocal pronoun and as an 'exclusive' pronoun. In the latter function, it
provides information about the will or high level of involvement of the Sor A,
i.e. A or S exclusively. Its meaning is captured by the following paraphrase: by
oneself, by one's own free will, on one's own. It does have a semantic restriction
in that it must be co-referent with the S or A. The forms themselves are derived
from other pronominal forms:
        kababu 'myself, on my own' < ka lSgA/S
        kerbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n SgExcl)' < kerbi ln SgExclO
        merbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n Sglncl)' < merbi ln SglnclO

                                          < taba(ra) 3Gen
        Note that the dual function of this set is parallel to the English pronominal
set with 'self: which can be used for both reflexive/reciprocal events, e.g. I hit
myself, and to mark an exclusive role in the action, e.g. I did it by myself.
        Some examples of the two uses follow:

        'The woman, herself, saw the ghost.'
        (i.e. it was not someone else who saw it)
       The two functions are usually kept distinct because when the pronoun is
being used in a syntactic function (i.e. as a reflexive/reciprocal pronoun), the verb
has the intransitiviser prefix ba-. Thus:
(2.256) ma mabu ba- smer-o
        2SgS 2SgRefl Intr-see- Fut2/3sg
        'See yourself.'
(2.257) ma mabu dasmer-o
        2SgA 2SgExcl see-       Fut2/3sg
         'See for yourself.'
       However, the language is in a state of flux with many speakers using the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as the only signal for reflexive/reciprocal
actions and reserving the pronoun for the exclusive meaning but with the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as well. Thus:
(2.258) werem ba- mri-          da
         childS Intr-sit down-PfSg
         'The child sat himself down.'
(2.259) werem tababu ba- mri-          da
         childS 3Excl Intr-sit down-PfSg
         'The child sat himself down on his own.'
       What seems to be happening is that the presence of the pronoun is
automatically triggering the intransitive form of the verb irrespective of whether
the action is reflexive/reciprocal or not. This change is probably due to the high
frequency of the two meanings of the pronoun (i.e. as both an exclusive marker
and a reflexive/reciprocal marker).
       One can speculate on the origin of this set of pronouns. Ray, in his study
(1907), gives the following set of genitive singular pronouns:
       kaba-ra 1SgGen (>modern: kara)
       maba-ra 2SgGen (>modern: mara)
       taba-ra 3SgGen       (>modern: tabara)
       These may have been the source of the roots of the pronominal set
discussed above. Note that the affix -bu that occurs suffixed to the pronouns,
e.g. kababu 'on my own', might be a particle or it might be derived from the
instrumental nominal suffix -u, e.g. bakir-u 'with a stone'. The consonant may
have been inserted because of two vowels occurring across a morpheme
boundary, e.g. kaba+u ---> kaba-b-u. (Consonant insertion is attested elsewhere
with the instrumental case, e.g. lu 'thing'---> lug-u 'with something'.) The
choice of the bilabial stop insertion could have been due to the presence of a                                                                             71
bilabial stop in the root (except for mabu, *mababu which was affixed to maintain
regularity within the paradigm). Thus, these free-standing pronominal forms
might be derived from the instrumental case but whose meaning is to provide
information about the clause as to the volition or the unique participation of the
A/S.","[80, 81, 82, 83]"
"3.     Previous Research on the Language.
       Earlier work on Meryam has been limitgd in quantity and quality. In 1893,
Ray and Haddon published a study of vocabularies and grammatical notes drawn
from various missionaries', explorers' and researchers' notes. Unfortunately, the
study is subject to the contributors' spelling idiosyncracies, e.g. 'Maer' for Mer, to
interpretations of the sort: 'I think the variation of initial vowel is only due to
the influence of individual choice', and to dubious meanings because of personal
beliefs, e.g. omare 'mercy'.
       The most extensive study is that of Ray (1907) which provides some 40
pages of grammar, 30 pages of vocabulary and 30 pages of texts. Such a study
provides the opportunity to compare earlier and later forms of the grammar.
       A more recent work was undertaken by Bartos (1977), who provides a
preliminary study of the sounds of the language, and a paper by McConvell (1983};
who examines ergativity and verb agreement in the language to demonstrate that
Meryam cannot be said to be fully ergative or accusative in its system.
       In addition, there are a number of primary sources such as texts produced
by Meryam students at the School of Australian Linguistics in the newsletter
Ngali and field notes kindly made available by Rigsby.",[14]
"Number/Person Markers for S of Intransitive Atelic Verbs.
      Prefixes affixed to intransitive atelic verbs cross-reference the number and
to some degree the person of the S argument. The following table shows the full
range of forms and functions:            Number:
Person:     singular /plural                 dual/paucal
1/2         na-                              d-
3            0-                              na-
             Number:
             singular                        nonsingular
             0-                              na-      The generalizations can be captured by saying that there is an opposition
between 1/2 and 3rd person in the forms and functions. There are two different
types of cross-reference marking for 3rd person (plural). One type contrasts the
dual/paucal with the singular/plural whilst the other type contrasts singular
with non-singular; in other words, the two types differ only in their number
reference not in their forms. When the S involves an inanimate noun, the cross-
reference marking tends to be singular versus nonsingular and there is typically
no distinction in either the form of the verb root or in the cross-reference
marking between the paucal and plural form. When the S involves an animate
noun (typically human or high animate beings like dogs), the type of cross-
reference marking is unpredictable and verbs can be of either type.
      Although the 0- form is given for ease of reference in the table, it is not
given in the morpheme by morpheme glosses as it is regarded as the unmarked
                                                                            125
form. Examples to illustrate the possibilities for the cross-reference markers are
presented with the verbs imi- 'Sg/DualS be sitting' and emr- 'Pauc/PlS be sitting':
(3.166) ka na-             mi-                 redi

         1n SgExclS Restr 1/2Dual/PaucS-Pauc/PlS be sitting-Pr
         'We (incl few) are just sitting.'
(3.169) e      imi-                   redi
         3SgS Sg/DualS be sitting-Pr
         'He is sitting.'
(3.170) wi        emr-                 (r)edi
         3n SgS Pauc/PlS be sitting-Pr
         'They (pl) are sitting.'
(3.171) wi        na-            mi-                   redi
         3n SgS 3Dual/PaucS-Sg/DualS be sitting-Pr
         'They (2) are sitting.'
(3.172) wi        na-            mr-                  (r)edi
         3n SgS 3Dual/PaucS-Pauc/PlS be sitting-Pr
         'They (paucal) are sitting.'
        To illustrate the other type of cross-reference marking with 3rd person
contrasting singular versus nonsingular, consider the following examples with
the verbs azirk- 'Sg/DualS be inserted' and azig- 'PIS be inserted':
(3.173) kara       battery azirk-                 edi torch-ge
         1SgGen EngS Sg/DualS be inserted-Pr Eng- Loe
          'My battery is inside the torch.'
(3.174) kara       battery n(a)- azirk-                     edi torch-ge
         1SgGen EngS 3n SgS-Sg/DualS be inserted-Pr Eng- Loe
          'My two batteries are inside the torch.'

          1SgGen Eng       3n SgS-PlS be inserted Eng- Loe
          'My batteries (many) are/were inside the torch.'
        An example of this type of cross-reference marking with animates can be
illustrated with the verb ikasir 'be going along':
 (3.176) wi       kep+kep le           pe na-      kasir
          3n SgS few Adj persons Deix 3n SgS-be going along

               There is a closed class of markers grouped together on a semantic basis as
        their meaning is dependent and relative to a place, time, referent or proposition.
        They can be regarded as deictic markers because they are 'aspects of the
        interpretation of sentences that relate to the speech act situation' (Fillmore, 1975;
        8). In Meryam Mir, this is reflected in the choice of marker being determined by
        the time at which the event or state happens or is happening relative to the time
        of the speech act itself.
               It is unclear whether the deictic markers are words or not. They may or may
        not carry an accent. Their distribution in the sentence is equally unclear. They
        always follow the first element in a sentence and they nearly always occur before
        the verb in a clause. They never occur in isolation but always in conjunction
        with a verb which suggests they do not have independent grammatical status. In
        most examples, the deictic markers can be omitted without altering the
        grammatical status although there is obviously a change in meaning. Thus, the
        main functional load is on their meaning rather than their syntactic role.
               Their status and grammatical function will be discussed following a
        description of their forms, features and pragmatic/semantic function. However,
        several points should be made before the description:
        (i) Examples have been drawn mainly from texts or casual conversation as
        elicitation proved to be unsuccessful though desirable for testing certain claims.
        One of the consequences of such an approach is that there are major gaps in the
        data and not all meanings are contrasted.
        (ii) The glosses and free translations reflect the analysis of the researcher rather
        than informants' translations as they rarely gave any translation for the markers
        other than a spatial meaning and in some of the examples, such a translation was
         clearly inadequate.
         (iii) A number of features are given for each deictic marker which may prove in
.. ,I
  I     the light of further research to be irrelevant in establishing the contrast between
         them. Nonetheless these features have been included to make the treatment of
         each marker as extensive as possible.
         (iv) There is variation amongst speakers as to the appropriate or suitable marker
         to be used. Some speakers actually 'correct' the form of the marker used by
         another speaker, which suggests the deictic system is in a state of flux. Speakers
         do have choices depending on the perspective they wish to take and particular
         features which determine the choice of marker for one speaker may not be the                                                                                   146
     same prominent features which determine the choice for another speaker. In
     other words, a certain amount of variation within the system may be the result of
     ongoing changes.
     (v) The analysis presented below is by no means final but represents a working
     hypothesis based on the current corpus of data. Further study in the area may
     result in considerable changes.","[156, 157, 158]"

3.8   Temporal/Aspectual Points of Reference.
      The main temporal/ aspectual points of reference in the language
correspond to the following:a long time ago   before today    earlier today
                                            moment         after moment of
                                            of speech      of speech

                  non present       present                non present
<------------( I )---------- 1-------------------- 1-------------------------->verb group 2 (telic active verbs):
                   non present        present            non present
                   imperfective       imperfective       imperfective
<--------( I )              ----1-----------------1--------------------->                 nonpresent
                 -past
<--------(I )----------1                                 non present
                       nonfuture                   1---------------------->
                       perfective                        - future
<------------( I )-------------------------------- I     (perfective)       The schema presented above is designed to give the reader a rough idea of
how the temporal/aspectual markers divide up the time line.
       Although two different time lines have been postulated for atelic and telic
verbs to capture the present versus nonpresent for atelic verbs and the present
imperfective versus nonpresent imperfective for telic verbs, these have the same
time reference. The difference between the two lies in that atelic verbs do not
have a perfective reading given that it is semantically incongruous to mark such
a notion whereas for telic verbs, a contrast between the perfective and
imperfective can be established. The present refers to all events/ states that occur
at the time of the speech act or to events that occur prior on the same day. The
nonpresent refers to all other times.
       The severed temporal/ aspectual line for telic verbs reflects shared as well as
distinctive features in the verbal morphology. There is a contrast in form as well
as temporal reference between nonfuture perfective and future perfective
markers (where future perfective refers to an event that will be completed). The
set of markers for the future-nonpresent and that for the nonpresent-past share
forms although these have different person reference. Both of these have non-                                                                             98
present reference. The nonfuture perfective markers contrast with the
nonpresent-past markers as the former can be used for events that occurred on
the same day as the speech act whereas the latter cannot. It is for the reasons
outlined above that a split temporal/ aspectual line has been drawn which both
relates and distinguishes the forms.
       What has not been represented in the time line above are the
temporal/ aspectual markers used for the remote past. These markers are a
combination in form of the prefix wa- and present imperfective, perfective and
past suffixes. Nothing will be said about them here as they will be treated in
detail below.","[108, 109, 110]"

                                                                          167
4.3   i1)     i - low deixis marker
       When speakers are asked to contrast the markers i and pe/ge, they say the
latter typically involves gesture whereas i does not. A linguistic explanation for
this feature is that pe and ge are high deictic markers, i.e. they have a stronger
new information content and request a higher degree of focus or attention on
behalf of the addressee) whereas i is a low deictic marker and does not require the
same degree of focus or attention. Consider the following examples with pe
contrasted minimally with i:
(4.78) able cup         i    ike
          Det <EngS Deix n PIS be(thing)
          'The cup is over here.'
          (where the cup is closer to the speaker than to the addressee)
(4.79) able cup pe ike
          Det <EngS Deix n PIS be(thing)
          'Here is the cup.'
          (where the speaker is holding out the cup towards the addressee)
(4.80) kara        sisi    i- noko            da-              Ii     Melbourne-ge
          lSgGen <EngS Deix-distant(Deix) n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf M.-              Loe
          'My sister is there in Melbourne.'
(4.81) kara sisi          pe- noko            da-              Ii      Melbourne-ge
          lSgGen <EngS Deix-distant(Deix) n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf M. -             Loe
          'My sister is now there in Melbourne.'
(4.82) neys u                   i    na-    ray-                     redi
          two coconut(tree)S Deix 3n SgS-n PIS be growing(plant)-Pr
          'There are 2 coconut trees are growing here.'
(4.83) neys u                     pe na-      ray-                    redi
          two coconut(tree)S Deix 3n SgS-n PIS be growing(plant)-Pr
          'Here are 2 coconut trees now growing.'
          (with the implication being that they were not growing before?)
       The examples with pe involve a change of state or location and hence a
high deictic marker is used whereas in the examples with i, there is no change in
state or location and hence a low deictic marker is used.2)   i- place
     'non-specific area' /'away from addressee'
     In a number of examples with verbs of non-motion or verbs of location, i
seems to mark a general area or possibly a place away from the addressee:
                                                                            168
(4.84)  inner ni        i    emge-              di
        rain waters Deix n PIS be(liquid)-Pr
        The rain water is around here.'
         (when the speaker is calling out to the addressee who is a short distance
         away)
(4.85) ka i-          ka na- mri-                 lu
         lSgS Deix-lSgS Futl-n PIS sit down-Futl
         'I will sit down around here/ I will sit down now I I will sit down here (at
        the place where I have been standing) I I will sit down here (at this place
         away from you, the addressee).'
      It can occur with the deictic affix -noko which is used to indicate distance
away from the speech act.:
(4.86) kara        sisi   i-   noko           da-              Ii     Melbourne-ge
         lSgGen <EngS Deix-distant(Deix) n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf M.-              Loe
         'My sister is there in Melbourne.'
      Contrast the i examples with the pe and ge examples below which refer to a
specific place and do not specify distance away from the addressee:
(4.87) ma pe- ma able mir                ditar-i?
         2SgA Deix-2SgA Det wordO write-Pf
         'Have you written that word down there?'
         (pointing to addressee's notebook)
(4.88) ka       ge- ka na- mri-                   lu
         lSgS Deix-lSgS Futl-n PIS sit down-Futl
         'I will sit down here (at this new place)/ I will sit down here (where I have
         not been sitting before.)'3)       i - source
      The marker i also implies movement away from the addressee or from the
deictic centre. In this context, it can be regarded as a source marker:
(4.89) e       i     ikase
         3SgS Deix be going along
         'There he goes.'
(4.90) e       pe ikase
         3SgS Deix be going along
         'Here he comes.'
(Note that in the example with i, it is uncertain whether the traveller is moving
away from the speech act place or merely not moving in the speaker's general
direction.)
(4.91) ka i           n- 6g- e         ge- ka ta- ra- gimu-lu
         lSgS Deix Futl-climb-Futl Deix-lSgS Deix-Futl-land- FutlSg
         'I will climb from here (and) land there.'","[178, 179, 180]"
"5.3     The Verb Complex.
        There are a number of uninflected nominals occurring within a sentence.
These must be considered as part of the verb complex. Consider the following
examples:
(5.35) ter mayso [mir iga- Ii]
          reef noises word speak-Prlmpf
          'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.36) Galiga [ut ipe-                 redi]
          G.S     sleep n PIS be lying-Pr
          'Galiga is sleeping.'
        The nominals mir 'word' and ut 'sleep' must be part of the verbal phrase
for the following reasons. The verbs given above are intransitive as evidenced by
zero marking on the S argument so the non-S argument cannot be 0. Its
function must be part of the verb phrase. Other arguments found in support of
this analysis follow.
        Nominals in the verbal phrase must occur immediately preceding the verb,
which suggests they form a syntactic unit:
(5.37) *mir ter mayso igali
          'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.38) *ut Galiga iperedi
          'Galiga is sleeping.'
        There is some suprasegmental evidence that the nominal and verb form a
single phonological unit. The main pitch-accent of the verb phrase is carried on
the nominal when it is mono-syllabic and the verb itself begins with a vowel,
e.g. tit ipe 'n PIS be lying asleep', but ipe 'n PIS be lying'.
        However, there are instances where the nominal's role is not
straightforward and it could either be a verbal nominal (i.e. within the verbal                                                                          187
complex) or a syntactic argument of the verb. Consider the following examples
where the verb might be di-transitive or transitive with a complex verb phrase:
(5.39) koskir-             ide lumi dikris-li      uteb- ge
        (married)female-A weed dear- Prlmpf place-Loe
        'The woman is clearing her place.'
(5.40) koskir-             ide (uteb) lumi dikris-li
        (married)female-A placeO weed dear- Prlmpf
        'The woman is clearing (her place).'
       In 5.39, number reference for the nonA nominal (be it 0 or whatever) is
automatically plural and no further cross-reference marking can be used. As 0
arguments for transitive verbs can be cross-referenced on the verb for number,
one must assume that the nominal is not an 0 and thus part of the verb complex.
Contrasting with this, in 5.40, number specification for 0 is singular, referring to
the number of yards, and cross-reference marking can be used to indicate
nonsingular number as exemplified below:
(5.41) koskir-             ide neys uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- i
         (married)female-A two placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-Pf
         'The woman cleared two yards.'
(5.42) koskir-             ide neys a    netat uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- idare
         (married)female-A two Conj one placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pauc
         'The woman cleared several yards.'
(5.43) koskir-             ide mitkar uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- a
         (married)female-A many placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pl
         'The woman cleared many yards.'
       The cross-reference markers for 0 provide syntactic evidence that the
nominal lurni 'weed' is part of the verbal complex and not an 0 argument.
       Given that there are complex verbal phrases in the language, it may be
possible to interpret one of the arguments of a di-transitive verb as a nominal
within the verb phrase rather than a syntactic argument. Consider an example
with a di-transitive verb such as ikwar 'give':
(5.44) ka       abi lu        ikwar-          i
         lSgA 3Sg0 thingO give Sg/DualO-Pf
         'I gave him something.'
(5.45) ka        abi lu      na-      kwar-         i
          lSgA 3Sg0 thingO 3n SgO-give sg/ dualO-Pf
          'I gave him two things.'
          (cross-reference marking to the inanimate 0 argument lu 'thing')
 (5.46) ka       yabi lu        na- kwar-             da
          lSgA 3n SgO thingO 3n Sg-give Sg/DualO-PfFl
          'I gave them something.'
          (cross-reference marking to the animate 0 argument yabi '3n SgO')                                                                           188
       As either of the nonA nominals can be cross-referenced on the verb (5.45
and 5.46), one must assume that both nominals are syntactic arguments of the
verb with the specification that only one of the arguments can be cross-referenced
at any one time on the verb. More examples need to be collected with (di)-
transitive verbs to prove this.
       A couple of transitive verbs have been collected where the nominal can
either be part of the verb complex or a syntactic argument:
(5.47) ka       mara mir        asr- i
         1SgA 2SgGen wordO hear-Pf
         'I heard your message.'
(5.48) ka lar- ira gepi           ditkiri-   (i)
         1SgA fish-Gen scalesO peel,scrape-Pf
         'I scaled the fish.'
(5.49) ka       mari mir n(a)-      asr- i
         1SgA 2Sg0 word 1/2Sg0-hear-Pf
         'I heard you (talking).'
(5.50) ka kumala              gegur ditkiri-      (i)
         1SgA sweet potatoO peel peel,scrape-Pf
         'I peeled the sweet potato.'
       It is unclear what the semantic distinction is between the two types. One
possibility may be that the nominal incorporated into the verbal phrase (5.49 and
5.50) is indefinite whilst the non-incorporated nominal (5.47 and 5.48) is definite.
An alternative explanation would be that the incorporated nominal focusses on
the activity itself whilst the non-incorporated nominal focusses on an end-point,
a purpose. Note, however, that for many verbs, there is no choice.
       There are examples of lexicalised complex verb phrases, that is where the
noun is an inseparable part of the verb phrase and its meaning. Examples of
lexicalised complex verb phrases include for intransitive verbs: i ezo 'cry'
(<tearN, shed?), erer ekri 'shout, squawk' (<shoutN, emit?), segur etker 'play'
(<playN, ?), kobek esi 'cough' (<coughN, bang down upon waves), and for
transitive verbs: upi diti 'help' (<tail?,?), lag dasur 'smell' (<smellN, ?), tag
digwat 'shake hands' (<hand, pull), op dipit 'meet' (<face, hit?), tep diskir 'taste'
(<skin of fruit, activity to do with mouth?).
       Within complex verbal phrases, a nominal can always be isolated from the
verbal component because verbal inflections occur only on the verb, not on the
nominal, and the nominal can always occur as an independent lexeme. It seems
that the generalization is as follows: at one end of the continuum, there are
nominals functioning as syntactic arguments of the verb and at the other end of
the continuum, there are nominals within verbal phrases forming an essential
part of the verb phrase's meaning. In between these two extremes, there are
                                                                            189
some verbs which allow both types to occur and these are exploited for various
stylistic purposes.

         The structure of a noun complex is as follows:Determiner-          N[modifier]-      N[head]       - giz 'Pl'
                     lAdjective                      ·(iba-ibi 'n Sg') £N-kem 'Ass'
                     lNoun-Gen                                         lN-ey 'Dual'(5.51)  [able mitkar epey ] pe da-ra-            mar
          Det many baskets Deix I -3n SgS- I PIS be resting upon
        'The many baskets are there (resting upon something).'
(5.52) [able kebi bam+bam nar ] pe ikase
        Det little tumeric Adj boats Deix be going along
         'The little yellow van is going by.'
(5.53) lim-ira bi
        sun-Gen light
         'sunlight'
      Case inflections are suffixed to the head or clitic immediately following the
head, i.e. giz, iba-ibi. Genitive nouns follow the order with the possessor (the
modifier) preceding the possessed (the head).
      The plural marker -giz(e) always directly follows the noun which it
modifies:
(5.54) gayr le-         gize kari na-     tager-da
         alot person-PIA lSgO 1/2Sg0-tell- P£Pl
         'Alot of people told me.'
       The marker -giz(e) behaves like inflections, which are always suffixed to the
noun. It can be regarded as a post-clitic since it forms a single phonological unit
with the noun, i.e. there is a single pitch-accent, e.g. netat le '1 person', gayr le-giz
'many people'.
       Not included in the structure of the noun complex outlined above are
locational adjuncts often involving a nominal and a locational noun acting like a
kind of postposition. Both are inflected for case:
(5.55) ka [pon- ge muy- ge] na-                 zirk-                  edi

         3n SgS Intr-chase away-P£Pl
         'They all ran away.'
       The alternation between the plural endings -darda and -da are determined
    by the verb's paradigm. If the singular form of the same root ends in -da(ri),
the plural form will be -darda. If the singular form ends in -i, the plural form
will be-da.
        The morpheme -i has been labelled singular /plural for number as it can be
suffixed to indicate either number with intransitive verbs. However, knowledge
of the full verbal paradigm, the form of the related root as determined by numbelj
and the marker itself, all combine to give its specific number reference:
(3.206) able nar ba- ytr- i
         Det boatS Intr-sink-Pf
          'The boat sank.'
(Contrast with the plural form that involves the same root form plus the plural
number marker -da: able nar ba-yter-da 'All the boats sank.')
(3.207) able le           b-     6s-                 i lokot-lam
          Det persons Intr+PlS-Pauc/PlS come out-Pf bush- Ahl
          'The people came out from the bush.'
 (Contrast with the paucal number which involves the same root but an overt
paucal suffix: able le b6s-idere lokotlam 'Several people came out from the bush.'
and the singular I dual number which will involve a different but related verb
root: able le ewsme-da lokotlam 'That person came out from the bush.')
        With transitive verbs, the marker -i always indicates that the A argument
is singular:
 (3.208) ka papek iwr- i
          lSgA matO weave-Pf
          'I wove a mat.'

"General rules for allomorphic variations:
        An accented front, high vowel /i/ followed immediately by a consonant
becomes a glide (w-y) when a morpheme is prefixed:
1. i[ +accent]            -> y I wa + -

         Contrast these with accented vowels other than /i/ which are not affected
by the above rules:

ba- (all homophonous forms)
        When the verb root commences with (a consonant and) an unstressed
vowel, these are deleted and the marker ba- is prefixed. When the verb root
commences with (a consonant and) a stressed vowel, the consonant is deleted
and the vowel is reduced to a glide or deleted or remains the same, and the prefix
is affixed. The rules for predicting the accented form when it is /i/, are covered by
the general rules for allomorphic variations outlined above. Thus:
ba + (C) V[-accent] --> ba + 0         ex. ba-taperet 'growl each other' (<etaperet)
                                           ba-saw 'rub each other' (<desaw)

                                           ba-ymi (intr.vb.) 'be closed' (<dimi tr.vb.)Problems of shift of stress-accent.
       The problem of shift in the stress-accent remains to be described. As stated
earlier, pitch-accent occurs on either the first or the second syllable. Inflected
forms of the verb retain the pitch-accent in the same position. For example, the
verb detager 'tell' has the pitch-accent on the second syllable and the pitch-accent
will remain in that position when inflected, e.g. wa-ditager 'Fut3 tell' (e--->i I
+accent). However, when the initial root vowel becomes a glide with the future
morpheme wa-, the accent seems to always fall on the first syllable, e.g. isim 'cut
Pauc/PlO' ---> wa-ysim 'Fut3 cut Pauc/PlO'. One possible explanation is that the
shift to first syllable position is parallel to first syllable accented verbs. For the
latter verbs, the initial root vowel becomes a glide when there are prefixes, in the
same way that initial root vowels of some verbs become glides with the
morpheme wa- (see the section on allomorphs of wa-, pl 12). This area clearly
requires more detailed work.3.5     lntransitiviser.
        The morpheme ba- forms intransitive verbs from transitive verbs. It is a
fully productive morpheme often making the action reflexive, i.e. both A and 0
---> S:
aw              'put in Sg/DualO'     b(a)-aw     'Sg/DualS go in'
a rot           'put in Pauc/PlO'     b(a)-arot   'Pauc/PIS go in'
dirmisir        'prepare'             ba-rmisir 'prepare oneself'

etawrik         'go around something' ba-tawrik 'turn around, change direction'
        It is the morpheme productively used to signal reciprocal relationships:
detager         'tell'                ba-tager    'talk to each other'
etaperet        'growl'               ba-taperet 'growl each other'                                                                               93
tag digwat 'shake hands'                   tag ba-wgwat 'shake each other's hand'
erap             'buy Pauc/PlO'            ba-rap      'buy each other Pauc/PlO'
eres             'beat up'                 ba-res      'beat each other up'
         It is also used when the 0 argument of the transitive verb becomes the S
argument of the intransitive verb, i.e. 0 ---> S:
disirik          'light'                   ba-sirik    'start to become alight'
etkir            'erase'                   ba-tkir     'fade'
iter             'immerse'                 ba-yter     'sink'
dimi             'close Sg/DualO'          ba-ymi      'n PIS become closed'
diski            'open Sg/DualO'           ba-wski     'n PIS become open'
         The intransitiviser morpheme permits constructions where the verb
signals the end point of a change of state:
(3.46) ka able lu- tam                erapey-           da
           1SgA Det thing-branchO break Sg/DualO-PfSg
           'I broke the branch.'
(3.47) able lu- tam             ba- rap- da
           Det thing-branchS Intr-break-PfSg
           'The branch has (become) broken.'
(The absence of number distinction in the verb root for the intransitive form
should be ignored as it is also possible to use this same form of the verb root in
the transitive construction with a singular 0.)
          However, the reader must not assume that the presence of /ba/ in a verb
automatically signals an intransitiviser. There is a homophonous morpheme
that marks the plural number of S, e.g. ekyam 'wake', ba-kyam 'Pl S wake'. There
are also verb roots, both transitive and intransitive, that begin with the phonemic
sequence /ba/ which is part of the verb root itself and not signalling a specific
intransitivised form, e.g. bakyamu (intr.vb.) 'Sg/DualS go'; batay (intr.vb.)
'grow'; baraygi (intr.vb.) 'n PIS dive close to surface'; batawered (tr.vb.) 'throw
SgO'; bayswer (tr.vb.) 'carry on shoulder' (related to the verb ayswer 'give
Pauc/PlO'?). There are also instances where the intransitiviser has become
lexicalised in that it is always affixed to the verb and contributes a distinct
meaning. The relationship between the transitive and intransitive form is not
 always transparent, e.g. 6ka ba-tager (intr.vb.) 'worry' (<oka 'concern' <detager
 'tell'); ba-kayret (intr.vb.) 'stare at one another' (<ikayret 'roast Sg/DualO on
open fire').
            Furthermore, the reader must not assume that verbs must be made
 intransitive when they are used without a syntactic argument as it is possible to
 have transitive verbs used without the A argument:
 (3.48) no nar tabra           na-      wsr-                iyey

might suggest that all consonants can occur with the bilabial glide preceding.
However, both of the examples (and there is only one example of each) are
obvious English loan words:

       pawl English fowl
More examples could be collected at a later date which could refute the claim that
these are non-permissible sequences.","[32, 33]"

(The above use needs to be tested with nonsingular (pro)nouns to see whether it
is still possible without the usual cross-referencing for number on the verb.)
         Morphemes beginning with a voiceless velar stop such as the privative
suffix -kak or the intensifier suffix -kar (see section 4 below p52) devoice the final
consonant of the root if it is a voiced stop:

comparison. There are no examples of this affix followed by a case inflection:

        'Gilam thought as he had the last time that (she) was a ghost.'
       The suffix -ise is frequently preceded by an affix -ka whose meaning is not
clear. Examples of its use are:
(2.117) ma pe siga           iri- Ii      kari-ka-yse
        2SgA Deix ciggieO drink-Primpf lsg- ?- Smbl

         'No-one knows how to make it (cocnnuted rice) like one's Kosir.'
(Note that in the above sentence, the privative phrase is functioning like a
predicate.)                                                                               50
      It may be that the semblative suffixes -kayse and -ise do not signal any
meaningful difference but are simply in free alternation. Alternatively, it may beO,
mor.photogical distinction where common nouns take the form -ise and other
nominals (pronouns and proper nouns) take the form -kayse.
        The suffix -kayse is also used with adjectives with a comparative effect:
(2.120) able wag kikem kelar- kak wam-i
         Det windS first       strength-Priv blow-Pf
         a       no abra       kelar     aw-ka-yse batay-0
         Conj Restr 3SgGen strengths big-?- Smbl grow-Pf
         'At first, the wind blew without strength (but then), its strength just
         grew bigger (or big-like?).'
        The related suffix -ka, which is often reduplicated on adjectives, occurs as a't\i
intensifier to indicate a greater or lesser degree:
(2.121) e       aw le      da-               Ii
         3SgS big person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is a big/old man.'
(2.122) e       aw-ka+ka le          da-             Ii
         3SgS big- Intens person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is a very big/old person.'
        In 2.122, -ka(ka) is functioning as an adjectival intensifier. There is a
similar derivation -kar which is added to nouns as an intensifier with the
meaning 'the real N, the even more like N':
(2.123) keymer-          kar
         young sibling-Intens
         'the youngest sibling'
(2.124) u-          kar    pe da-                 Ii
         coconut-Intens Deix n PIS be(person?)-Prlmpf
         'Those are the proper kind of palm trees.'
        The suffix -ka occurring on adjectives and the suffix -kar occurring on
nouns could be related and these in turn are probably related to the semblative
construction with -kayse.
        There are comparative constructions with the ablative case used to mark a
standard comparison (2.125 and 2.126) and the allative case used to mark the
property with respect to which a comparison is made (2.127):
 (2.125) yaba         mir wi          dipigeme-daryey, akay-da yaba            mir

          'They (2) changed their language (Central Islanders') so that it became
          slightly different from (that) spoken at Mabyog.'","[60, 61, 62]"
"8.    The ablative case (-lam/-ilam), like the allative case, has local, temporal
and causal meanings. It is used to mark the point from which there is
movement away:
(2.51) e      op- dewday- lam ta- bakyamu- da
         3SgS face-mainland-Ahl Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
         'He came from Papua New Guinea.'

         3SgS Deix-climb down-Pf hill- Ahl
         'He came down from the hill.'
       This case inflection can also be used to mark the cause (of a non-finite
clause):
(2.53) ka gim+gim n(a)- a-                        Ii      waywi aro- lam
         lSgS illness Adj 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf mangoO eatN-Abl
         'I am sick from eating mangoes.'
       It can also be extended in meaning to include a temporal notion, i.e. to
mark from a particular point in time:
(2.54) ki-lam 'from/ since last night'
         emeret-lam 'from a long time ago'9.     The genitive case (-ira - -ra) is used to mark the beneficiary or goal of an
action:
(2.55) ka laglag epey           a- rapey-           lu      kari    ama- ra
        lSgS wantN basketO Futl-buy Sg/DualO-FutlSg lSgGen mother-Gen
        'I want to buy a basket for my mother.'
       Note that there is overlap in the functions of the allative case with its
purposive function and the genitive case with its beneficiary function. (It remains
to be tested whether it can also be used as a maleficiary.) It could be argued that in
Meryam Mir, the genitive case includes within its meaning both a benefactive
and purposive meaning. This would account for the more felicitous and
common sentence given below with the genitive rather than the allative case:
(2.56) kara      mekir          ageg            t-  iruk-       o
         lSgGen almond(tree) fleshy fruit?O Deix-pluck PIO-Fut2/3sg
        'Pick me some almonds.'
         ?kari-m mekir ageg tiruk
               -All
       The two cases, namely the genitive and allative case, must have some
overlap in their function as well as permitting some slight nuance in meaning
because there are examples where the two cases co-occur within a single sentence:
                                                                              39
(2.57)  ka abra         kerkar wali         ti- d- irapey-            da

        'I bought him a new shirt in town.'
       Clearly more work needs to be done in this area to refine the distinctions
between the allative and genitive cases.
       The genitive case is used to mark the possessor/owner of an alienable or
inalienable object/physical quality /person/body part:
(2.58) ka pleyn-ira bUm.er d-              asr- i

(2.60) Lez-ira newbet ewmi-da
        L.- Gen FZ S die- PfSg
        'Les' aunty died.'
       The genitive case can also be used to mark the experiencer of a physical or
emotional state:
(2.61) Galiga-ra werer         bark- i
        G.-       Gen hungers happen-Pf
        'Galiga is hungry /Hunger happened for Galiga.'
(2.62) able le-       ra weku bark- i
        Det person-Gen angers happen-Pf
        'That person is angry I Anger happened for that person.'
       The genitive case cannot occur when the complex noun phrase itself is
marked by a case as in the following examples. In 2.63, it cannot occur with the
locative case; in 2.64, it cannot occur with the ergative case; in 2.65, it cannot
occur with the semblative case and in 2.66, it cannot occur within a noun phrase
itself marked by the genitive case:

         The ending suffixed or pronominal form for the absent genitive is
phonologically homophonous with the 0 argument case form for proper nouns,
i.e. -i,or the accusative pronominal form. One could speculate that the case
marker for this argument is the accusative/ dative case marker as it is used in
adnominal possession, it is typically the base for oblique inflections on proper
nouns and pronouns and, it is used to mark definite or human direct objects.
Another possibility is that there are alternations in the form of the genitive case
morpheme itself, i.e. -i ,.. -y, used when the complex noun phrase in which it
occurs carries another case inflection. Evidence that these are indeed
morphological alternations of the genitive case can be seen by the fact that these
case markers also occur with common nouns (which do not take the case suffix -i
in the accusative case) when they are in a possessor relation within a case-marked
complex phrase:
(2.67) kari        newr-i      kimyar-      ide abi detagr-i
           1SgGen girl- Gen (married)male-A 3Sg0 tell- Pf
           'My daughter's husband told him.'
         Contrast with the lexical compound newr kimyar 'sister-in-law' where
there is no genitive marking (2.83):
(2.68) kari newr kimyaride abi detagri
           'My sister-in-law told him.'
         Another example follows of a common noun suffixed with the alternative
form of the genitive case:
 (2.69) able ama-        y werm-et abi detagr-i
           Det mother-Gen child- SgA 3Sg0 tell- Pf
           'The mother's son told him.'
           *able ama wermet abi detagri
         Although the genitive case marker cannot be confused with the accusative
 case marker in the examples given above, there are many examples in the third
 person singular where these two functions cannot be distinguished, that is where
 the (pro)nominal phrase could be analysed as the 0 argument or as the
 phonologically reduced genitive case. For example:                                                                           41

(This ambiguity is only present in the singular third person because 1st /2nd
person objects or 3rd person non-singular objects will be cross-referenced on the
verb.)

       -ira I elsewhere            ex. newr-ira omay 'the girl's dog'  10.     The associative case (-kem) is suffixed to an inanimate noun to indicate
  that it was associated although not used to perform the action:
  (2.73) e        digm-i koket-            kem
           3SgS walk- Pf walking stick-Ass

           'He gathered up his things with these words: .. .'
          Contrast the above examples with the following where the instrumental
  case is used to indicate the action was performed using the object:
  (2.76) e digm-i koket-u
                             -Instr
           'He walked using his walking stick.'

           'They (2) insulted each other.'
           (lit: they (2) did things to each other using words)
          The associative case -kem and the allomorph -ipkem (used with proper
  nouns and possibly with kinship terms, e.g. ama-ypkem 'along with mothers),                                                                            42
are used to indicate that the person was associated with a particular event
although not a participant:
(2.78) lu      ba- kawert-                 i Lez-ipkem
        thingS Intr-take down Sg/DualO-Pf L.- Ass
        'The things were unloaded in Les' presence.'
       A similar form and parallel use occurs with pronominals:
(2.79) Dawgiri erkep ikered-            er        ge Bame-y erdar-i
        D. S     eye n PIS be(thing)-n Prlmpf Deix B-         0 see- Pf

        Deix-Intr-row-Pf 3Sg-Ass sand-Loe land- PfSg
        'Dawgiri was watching when he saw Bame swimming (towards the area
        where Dawgiri was) and right in front of Dawgiri, Bame came up onto the
        beach.' (Dewmer p210, section12)
       Andrews (1985) makes a useful distinction between circumstantial and
participatory roles which correspond neatly to the associative versus
instrumental case. The associative case involves a circumstantial role as the
phrase forms ""part of the setting of the event"" whilst the instrumental case
involves a participatory role with the phrasE; an ""actual participant in the
situation implied by the verb"" (Andrews, Ibid; 69). An argument marked with
-kem/-ipkem is signalling that the thing/person was present although not an
instrument or participant in the activity.
       How does the associative differ from the locative when the locative case
carries a comitative meaning? Whilst the locative case is marked on an animate
noun to indicate thats/he performed the same action at the same place as the
S/ A, the associative case is also marked on an animate noun but to indicate that
s/he was at the same place although not performing the event/activity.
However, there is a further use of the associative suffix which is exploited in a
participatory role to indicate paucal or plural inclusion; in this use, it is always
within a complex noun phrase. This function will be examined in the following
section.","[50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"
"                                                                        128
(i.e. It is underlyingly a d-d sequence with deletion, or the cross-reference marker
is absent altogether and it is the pronominal form only which is providing
number information.)
         The number of inanimate objects can always be expressed through
independent lexical modifiers:

data will reveal what are the factors.","[139, 140]"

        What has been presented above suggests that some verbs have forms from
each conjugation type to convey the number of 0 and that there is a correlation
between conjugation type 1. and overt marking of singular/dual S/O. However,
there are verbs which have forms from each conjugation type and these are
neither semantically nor morphologically motivated. In some cases, the
alternation appears to be phonologically motivated: verb roots from conjugation
2. ending in /r/ are suffixed with paucal forms from conjugation 1, e.g. dasmer
'see' ---> dasmer-i Pf---> dasmer-dare PfPauc, *dasmer-idare; erdar 'watch' --->
erdar-i Pf--> erdar-dare PfPauc, *erdar-idare. In other cases, there is no
phonological environment for predicting the form and these must be considered
exceptions: a verb root from conjugation 2. such as esi 'bang against the waves'
(example from McConvell (1983; 17) has the dual form from conjugation 1.
suffixed, e.g. esi-0 Fut2/3, esi-lam Fut2/3Dual. Many verbs which have been
intransitivised, have forms from each conjugation type, e.g. ba-dmirik 'run
away' (<Intr-chase away) ---> badmirik-da Pf--> badmirik-daryey PfDual -->
badmirk-idere PfPauc, *badmirikdere; ba-rap 'be broken' (<Intr-break) --> barap-
da Pf--> barap-iyey PfDual, *barap-daryey; ba-rbor 'be broken by tearing' (<Intr-
throw?) --> barbor-da Pf--> barbor-iyey PfDual, *barbor-daryey. Given that
inflections from conjugation 1. end predominantly in a consonant whilst those
from conjugation 2. end predominantly with a vowel, these may be
phonologically rather than semantically motivated. Furthermore, note that
when there are related root forms for different number, it is the paucal/plural
forms that often end with a consonant and the singular I dual forms which end in
a vowel. It may be the language is in a process of change and/or speakers are
regularizing the processes although exceptions remain. Some evidence in
support of this latter claim is provided by one speaker who gives 'earlier' forms
of the language: e.g. barap-da 'be broken Pf', older form barapi. Another
hypothesis is that some forms only are semantically motivated whilst others are
morphologically motivated.","[146, 147]"
"        Markers used in the future involve the addition of prefixes for 1st and 3rd
person namely (n)a- for 1st person and wa- (o-) for 3rd person as well as suffixes.
        There are several other temporal/ aspectual distinctions that are all derived
from other existing forms or rather a combination of prefix and suffix. The past
irrealis is formed by the prefix wa- and the perfective suffix:

      One pair of verbs has been recorded where the alternation between the
intransitive and transitive form involves the sequence I di/. It corresponds to the
same transitiviser process with the addition of the consonant:

       As the reader may have noted from the examples cited above, there is a
high correlation of telic verbs, both transitive and intransitive, whose roots or
stems begin with /e/. It may be that verbs have phonotactic restrictions in their
occurrence in having to commence with (d)V. As a consequence of this
restriction, verbs that begin with a non-permissible consonant are prefixed with
the formative I e/.
       The plural intransitive telic prefix ba- and the formative e- are mutually
exclusive, e.g. ewrni 'n PIS die' and ba-wrn 'PIS die'. Similarly, the intransitiviser
ba- and the formative e- are mutually exclusive, e.g. erap 'break' and ba-rap 'be
broken'. Here are some transitive and intransitive verbal forms (see also
examples from the transitiviser section):

-dar- 'Non-Punctiliar' Derivation.
       It is unclear what the affix marker -dar- means. It may be from the paucal
number suffix or from an old auxiliary. In some cases, it appears completely
lexicalised to the meaning of the verb, e.g. er-(dar-) 'watch' where all verbal
inflected forms occur with the affix -dar-: a-r-dar-e Fut1, er-dar-i Pf, er-dar-iyey
PfDual, er-dar-dare P£Pauc, er-dar-da P£Pl, but consider its nominalised form: ir-
em 'to watch' (lit: see-All). In some cases, it is only found on the paucal/plural
forms of verbs, e.g. upi diti 'help Sg/DualO', upi diti-dar- 'help Pauc/PlO', but
consider the nominalised form: upi a-ti-dar-em 'to help'. In some cases, it occurs
optionally with nonpresent durative inflections, e.g. ewsmer 'Sg/DualS come
out', ewsme-dar-er - ewsmer-er n Prlmpf, but ewsme-li Prlmpf, *ewsme-da(r)-li,
e~g. ekyam 'wake up', ba-kyam-er - ba-kyam-dar-er PIS n Prlmpf:

       In some cases, it is obligatorily suffixed with all durative type inflections:
e.g. b-aw 'Sg/DualS go in', b-a-da(r)-li Prlmpf, *ba-li, b-a-dar-er n Prlmpf, *ba-r-er;
mir atrum 'suggest Sg/DualO', atrum-da(r)-li PrlmpfSg, *atrum-li.
       Whilst it is not possible to predict when it will occur, it is possible to see a
recurrent meaning associated with the suffix, namely that all events are non-
punctiliar as they are either extended in time, repeated several times or over a
long time period. It may be that it is historically derived from a non-punctiliar
derivational morpheme.","[151, 152, 153]"

                                                                           181
       Deictic markers cover a wide range of functions. They are markers which
can contrast or highlight various elements of a sentence or utterance. Those
elements can be referents, events/states or entire propositions. The evidence
presented suggests that they are more discourse sensitive than syntax sensitive.
There is much overlap in function between what is described in many other
languages as switch-reference marking and these deictic markers. When they are
tracking referents, are they not marking these as being the same or different (or
new)? Furthermore, the correlation between temporal relations of switch-
reference systems and that of deictic markers' functions are again quite striking.
Switch-reference markers often indicate a temporal sequential and/ or
simultaneous relation with the previous clause parallel to the deictic markers)
although these often also include a logical relation with the previous clause.
       It can be informally noted that the clauses with deictic markers pa and ga
generally involve a much tighter syntactic linkage with the antecedent clause
than deictic markers pe and ge. There are no instances in the data of pa and ga
occurring with a discourse initial clause. In contrast, markers pe and ge may or
may not occur with a discourse initial clause. Similarly, both markers i and ya can
occur discourse initially but only the marker ya marks a clause where the relation
to its antecedent clause is that of sequence or expressing some kind of logical
relation.","[192, 193]"

        The temporal reference of nonpresent sometimes appears to also include
the present when referring to habitual events and probably means something
like: it is always this way and will always be this way. It might also be indicating
that it is not occurring at the time of the speech act but does indeed happen, i.e. a
kind of present irrealis. For example:
(3.93) Lez w- ekyam-dar-er                gayr idim-      ge idim      kakar- ge

(The discussion of the morpheme/root form -dar- will be delayed until the end of
the section outlining the meanings and functions of the Non-Productive
Derivations p142.)Perfective.
      The suffixes in this category are in their broad meaning nonfuture markers
used for events that are completed,, or about to be completed, at the time of the
speech act. They thus encode a temporal feature of nonfuture as well as an
aspectual feature of perfectivity. To illustrate their meaning, here are a few
examples:

        'I have scooped up our big fish with the fish trap.'
       There are instances where the nonfuture perfective is used for events that
are not yet completed at the time of the utterance. Such events are punctiliar and
the perfective is used to indicate that the outcome or achievement is inevitable
and imminent. It is for this reason that it is appropriate the marker should
involve a temporal element, namely, the nonfuture. Consider the following
examples where the imminent realisation and the punctuality of the event
necessitate the perfective:
(3.98) ka pe- ka wabi dikayrt-i
        1SgA Deix-1SgA 2n SgO leave- Pf
         'I will now leave you (pl) here.'

         1SgA Deix-1SgA 2Sg0 1 /2Sg0-sit- PfSg
         'I am now leaving you (sg) here.'
       The perfective suffixes are also used to indicate a change of state, something
that has re~ulted from a process:
(3.100) kara      tag pim ismi-                da
         1SgGen hand finger cut Sg/DualO-PfSg
         'My finger got cut.'

         'The shop is closed, i.e. it has become closed.'
       Contrast the above example (3.103) with that below (3.104) which is a
nominalised verb used in an ascriptive sentence and involves a state, not a
change of state:
(3.104) able pamas aymir+aymir ike-                  (redi)

"                                                                              18
      In this study, the syllable has been arbitrarily selected as corresponding to
the following types. A syllable must minimally consist of a vowel:
V      o 'liver' VG aw 'big'           GV wi '3n Sg' GVG         way 'coconut seed'
CV pi 'dust' CVG pew 'wing' CGV Pyu name CGVG syaw 'sneeze'
VC op 'face' VGC Awm name GVC wir 'coal' GVGC ways 'take Fut3'
CVC pit 'nose' CVGClayp 'ear'          CGVCnyap 'thirst'CGVGC (no examples)
       Some elaboration is required. The glides, at least with regard to the syllable
structure, need to be distinguished from consonants as glides can occur with
consonants in a word-initial and word-final cluster whereas a consonant cluster
(i.e. with no glides) is not possible in these positions. Consequently, I have
chosen to treat them as a distinct class in order to preserve phonotactic
generalizations. However, note that glides and consonants share features as one
would expect and it is sometimes arbitrary to label a sound sequence such as pew
'wing, flipper' of the type CVG rather than CVC. For reasons given above, the
distinction is best maintained. Any phonemic sequence that is longer than the
sequences listed is regarded as non-monosyllabic. Consider, for example:
        way.su 'vagina'
        ma.yu 'golden trevally'
        mwey.ni 'woven mat for scooping things'
        mak.rem - ma.krem 'unmarried male'
        kim.yar - ki.myar 'married male'
        i.k6s 'spear (verb)'
        is.mi - i.smi 'cut Sg/DualO'
      It is sometimes difficult to determine where the boundary lies between two
syllables. In such instances, ambisyllabicity must be assigned. This is the case
when there is a consonant cluster of two consonants or a consonant plus glide.
When there is a glide and consonant cluster, the glide is assigned to the previous
syllable and the consonant to the following syllable. H there is a single consonant
or glide, then it is typically perce·1ved as belonging to the syllable following.
       In addition, affixed morphemes affect the type of syllable structure
permitted. To illustrate, consider the following sequence /ks/ found in sek+sek
'wrong, bad' (from the reduplicated form sek?). Compare this to the verb iski
'spear Pf' which is derived from the root ikos suffixed with the perfective
marker -i triggering final vowel deletion (parallel to the verb dirpi 'sweep '\'f '
derived from the verb root dirup). Thus, reduplication allows different
consonant clusters to those found at oiher morpheme boundaries.","[29, 30]"
"Verbs.
       Verbs are an open class of words which refer to either states, e.g. ut ipe 'be
asleep', processes, e.g. esk 'flow', edug 'burn', or events, e.g. ewmi 'die', ero 'eat'.
The verb has inflections carrying aspectual/ temporal information as well as
number /person agreement cross-referencing syntactic arguments. These markers
provide the formal characteristics that permit verbs to be categorised into two
classes. These two classes,, have some semantic correlation dividing atelic
statives from telic process verbs although class membership can be purely formal.
For example, an event such as ikase 'go along' is classified, at least
morphologicall~ as an intransitive atelic stative verb, i.e. 'be going along'.",[40]

             Contrast the above examples with those following where the time

             The present imperfective marker is also used to indicate
     repetition/iterativity. Examples to illustrate this latter use follow:

(Contrast with example 3.76 where the nonplural form of the verb is used.)
       How to account for this specification? One possibility is to state that
imperfective verbs are not specified for number in the root and hence, the least
marked form is used (either the paucal/plural or nonplural form) as the event or
activity is not yet completed and consequently, it is not possible to use a specific
verb root form (singular I dual-plural).","[114, 115, 116]"
"2.     Language Oassification and Type.
       Unlike its neighbour Kala Lagaw Ya, which is classified as an Australian
Paman language, Meryam Mir is classified by Wurm (Ibid) as a Papuan language
of the Trans-Fly stock with a close genetic relationship to the languages of the
Eastern Trans-Fly Family, Bine, Gidra and Gizra.
       Its phonology is relatively simple, comprising a three way distinction in
point of articulation for oral voiced and voiceless stops (bilabial, alveolar and
velar) and a two way distinction in point of articulation for nasal stops and glides                                                                                 1
(bilabial and alveolar). The remaining consonants, a voiced and voiceless
fricative, a lateral and a rhotic tap, are all produced at the alveolar point of
articulation. The language has a five vowel system contrasting front and back
vowels /i, e/ and /u, o/ with a low central vowel /a/. The pitch-accent is
phonemically significant in the language, serving to distinguish certain lexical
items. Every word bears a high pitch on either the first or second syllable with
the majority of words carrying high pitch on the second syllable. The phonology
is covered in Chapter 1.
       The following word classes can be distinguished: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, deictics and interjections. Nouns and pronouns are
inflected for syntactic and non-syntactic cases. The cases are: ergative,
nominative, accusative, instrumental, allative (which includes some of the
functions of dative in other languages), ablative, locative, associative (which
could be labelled alternatively 'comitative') and genitive. There is a split case
marking system with an ergative case pattern on nouns for subjects of transitive
verbs and a nominative case pattern on pronouns for subjects of transitive or
intransitive verbs. Within the noun category, a distinction can be drawn between
common and proper nouns. With proper nouns, there is a three way split in the
case marking system with distinct inflections for the subject of a transitive verb,
the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb. Adjectives
as well as possessors marked by the genitive immediately precede the noun
which they modify and are thus syntactically dependent on the noun which is the
head.
        Pronouns distinguish between first, second and third person with a further
distinction contrasting inclusion and exclusion for first person nonsingular. In
addition, there are distinct forms for the singular versus non-singular. There is
no gender distinction with third person. Word classes and nominals are covered
in Chapter 2.
        Verbs can be categorised into two classes: atelic stative and telic active.
These classes are morphologically determined since the atelic stative verbs only
include intransitive verbs which mark the subject by means of a prefix, whereas
 the telic active verbs mark either the transitive or intransitive subject
 predominantly by means of a suffix. The two verb classes are partially
 semantically motivated as suggested by the names atelic stative and telic active.
 Verbal cross-reference markers encode information about both number,
 distinguishing singular, dual, paucal and plural, and to some degree, person.
        Time is divided up along the lines of present versus non-present where
 present refers to events that occurred any time on the same day as the utterance
 and non-present for events that occurred on another day or will occur following
 the utterance. There are also aspectual features such as the imperfective and the
 perfective. In addition, there is a mood marker, the irrealis non-committal,                                                                            2
which conveys the lack of commitment on behalf of the speaker to say whether
something will happen or not. Temporal, aspectual and mood categories, cross-
reference markers and other features of the verbal morphology are covered in
Chapter 3. Included in this chapter is a brief survey of adverbs, their formation
and function.
       There is a rich and complex system of deixis in the language which is
explored in Chapter 4. Deictic markers' forms are determined by the temporal
occurrence of the event relative to the time of the utterance. Their function is to
essentially focus on various elements in space, time and in discourse itself.
       Existential/locational verbs, intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs
form the basis of simple clauses. However, there are many events or states which
are expressed by complex verbal phrases consisting of a noun and verb with
nominals forming an essential part of the verbal's meaning. In such instances,
the whole verb phrase must be regarded as a complex head. There are no valency
changing operations except for an intransitiviser morpheme. A verb's valency is
more or less fixed with some non-productive morphemes affecting the verb's
transitivity and with periphrastic constructions for expressing inchoative and
causative meanings. Basic sentence types, verbal and nominal phrases as well as
some complex sentences are briefly examined in Chapter 5.
       The following study is a sketch grammar of Meryam Mir with special
attention to verbal morphology and the system of deixis.","[12, 13, 14]"
"3.11   Non-Productive Derivations.
       There are several morphemes used to signal meanings such as 'similar
type of action', 'transitiviser' and 'word formative'. Several language-internal
reasons contribute to their classification as derivations rather than inflections.
They are only semi-productive, unlike inflections. When they do occur, they
occur in all the forms inflected for tense/ aspect/mood including the 2nd person
future singular - a form of the verb that can be characterised as bearing no
inflection. They are always affixed to the verb root before any inflections and
thus are part of the lexical formation process rather than the syntactic process.d- 'Similar type of action' Derivation.
      There are variations in certain verbal forms differing only in the presence
or absence of an initial consonant Id/. This may simply be a phonemic
alternation not signalling a meaningful relation or it may be a meaningful
morpheme. However, this relation is somewhat obscured at a synchronic level,
possibly the result of diachronic development. The hypothesized morphemed-
has no syntactic function in that derived verbs are of the same valency. The
process is not fully productive as not all verbs have the semantic alternation.
Some examples include:
water versus land?:
      ereb 'punt (a boat)'                   d-ereb 'dig'
land versus water?:
      igwat 'pull, inhale'                   d-igwat 'fish i.e. pull in Pauc/Pl fish'
      emarge 'n Pl land vehicle,             d-emarge 'n Pl water vehicle,
                be stationary'                            be stationary'                                                                             139
similar type of action?:
       etaw(e)rik 'go around something' d-etaw(e)rik 'turn something around'
       ewer 'weave'                           d-ewer 'build'
       kar iruk 'build a fence'               kar d-iruk 'emprison' (lit: fence-erect)
       ipit 'hit, kill'                       op d-ipit 'meet' (lit: face-hit)
       ikris 'scrape, scratch'                lumi d-ikris 'weed' (lit: weed-scrape)
       erep 'rub together                     d-erep 'mix'
              such as for compost'
       To characterize the relationship between the different forms as merely
'similar types of action' is inadequate and it would apply to many verbs whose
forms do not have related forms. Furthermore, there are verbal forms where the
same contrast exists phonemically but are obscure semantically, e.g. ikayret 'roast
on fire sg/dualO', and dikayret 'leave'.i- Transitiviser Derivation.
       There is a recurrent root initial vowel /i/ with transitive verbs) that may
correspond to a transitiviser morpheme, although it is not fully productive.
Consider the related pairs:
A=S:
       ewtmer 'ask for something'              itmer 'ask someone'
S=O:
       akaweret 'n PIS climb on'               ikaweret 'transport Sg/DualO'
       ba-tir 'PIS climb on' (<etir 'get out'?)itir 'transport Pauc/PlO'
       etrum 'n PIS come down'                 itrum 'bring down Sg/DualO'
       ewsmer 'Sg/DualS be born'               ismer 'give birth to Sg/DualO'
       ews(-os) 'Pauc/PlS be born'             is 'give birth to Pauc/PlO'
       espi(r) 'marry to someone, hide'        ispi(r) 'marry, hide something'
       edug 'burn'                             idug 'cause to burn'
       This can only be stated as a tendency rather than a pervasive rule. There
are, for example, many transitive verbs which do not begin with the vowel /i/,
e.g. erap 'break Pauc/PlO'; dayu 'dig for Sg/DualO'. There are also intransitive
verbs which begin with the vowel /i/ and must be considered part of the verb
root, e.g. digem 'walk'; ditimed 'start'; ikarik 'come up to the surface of the
water'; igar 'speak'. There are instances where the transitive form of the verb has
a phonemically-related intransitive form but the relationship between the two
has been obscured or is not. at least to a European, transparent, e.g. ipit 'hit, kill'
(<epit 'blossom, flower'?). There are instances where no phonemically-related
intransitive form of the verb has been collected, e.g. ikris 'scratch, scrape (as in a
coconut)' (<*ekris).","[150, 151]"

       Whilst the cross-reference marking system may appear complex, the reader
should recall that most verb roots themselves, mark number distinctions. There
are three types of verb root: Sg/Dual versus Pauc/Pl, NonPl versus Plural, and
no number distinction. The prefix cross-reference markers are of two types:
Sg/Pl versus Dual/Pauc and, Sg versus NonSg. Because the prefixes and verb
roots have a different number opposition, the maximum distinctions for number
are achieved through a minimum number of forms. This is a highly economical
system of marking.
       As verb roots' number distinctions carry predominantly number
information about the S or 0 arguments, it is important that suffixes carry
number information about the A argument; hence there is an extensive cross-
reference marking system in the suffix position contrasting singular, dual, paucal
and plural. However, as there are verbs which have number information that is
not restricted to a particular argument, it is the combination of markers and verb
roots themselves which achieve specific number distinctions.","[148, 149, 150]"

      Number marking is an important feature of verbs. There are cross-
reference markers and verb roots carrying number information about syntactic
arguments. Some roots are related to one another in form whilst others are
suppletive bearing no resemblance to one another.(i) same form for all numbers:
       detager     'tell'
       erdar       'see'
       badmirik 'chase oneself away'
       ero         'eat'
       iri         'drink'
       ikasir      'be going along'
       eme(r)      'nonhuman be sitting'
       ekyam       'wake up'
       ezo         'cry'
       og          'climb'       Some of the verbs listed in this group (as in other groups) show slight
modifications in the verb stem such as initial vowel loss when certain prefixes
are affixed. For example, with the plural S morpheme b(a)-, there is a change in
the verb form with the deletion of the initial vowel, e.g. ekyam 'wake up', ba-
kyam 'PIS wake up', i ezo 'cry' (lit: tear shed), i ba-zo 'PIS cry'.(ii) suppletive forms for different numbers:
       ikedi        'put down Sg/DualO'          idag 'put down Pauc/PlO'

(The vowel postulated for the plural form of the existential/locational verb for
things is not known because the verb never occurs without the 3rd person non-
singular prefix na- which always triggers initial vowel loss, e.g. na-gri.)(iii) related form for number i.e. through regular morphological alternation:

       Some verbs in this set have the penultimate vowel deleted in the
singular I dual form. This may be the result of historical changes where the
vowel became unstressed or the pitch-accent shifted to another syllable (parallel
to tabara-tabra-taba-tara '3Gen'):
       akmey        'dip Sg/DualO' (?<akemey) akem 'dip Pauc/PlO'
       ismi         'cut/ chop Sg/DualO' (?<isimi)isim 'cut/ chop Pauc/PlO'
       For most verbs, the (paucal)/plural form is derived either by the loss of the
final vowel (plus consonant/ glide) or the loss of the entire syllable. In some
cases, other changes are involved such as the syllabification of the final glide, e.g.
ekw ---> eko, or the insertion of a glide in a root ending in a vowel, e.g. bakya--->
bakyaw. In some cases, a vowel is inserted to break up a word final cluster which
is unacceptable in the phonotactic structure of the language, e.g. etakr--->etaker,
or the medial consonant cluster is broken up and the consonants are
metathesized, e.g. diske --->dikes. The reductions are:

          etomeret 'show Pauc/PlA/O'                  etomer 'show Sg/DualA/0'          There are a few verbs whose related forms do not follow any familiar
    pattern. (The underlying form is possibly a combination of both root forms.)
    There are too few examples to generalize, only the type of changes can be
    presented:
          emri 'n PIS sit down'                Vmer 'PIS sit down'
    (From the postulated underlying root emeri where there is deletion of the final
    vowel for the plural form and loss of the mid vowel for the nonplural form.)
           esk- 'n PIS be flowing'             Vkos 'PIS be flowing'
    (From the postulated root ekos where there is deletion of the final vowel for the
    n PIS form causing an unacceptable consonant cluster /ks/ which is
    metathesized.)
           imi- 'Sg/DualS be sitting'          emr- 'Pauc/PlS be sitting'
    (From the postulated root emir where there is deletion of the final vowel for the
    Pauc/PlS form and deletion of the final consonant for the Sg/DualS form.)          There are some verb roots whose number reference alters depending upon
    its meaning. This may be the result of idiosyncratic, isolated instances or it may
    be a feature of specific meanings. For example, the transitive verbs itrum and
    erap:
           itrum 'take out from large opening Sg/DualO,
I                   take off/down all no.0';
           iti 'take out from large opening Pauc/PlO'
    (3.1)    ka lewer itrum-                   dari s6span-lam

             'I took out a piece of food from the saucepan, i.e. one banana.'","[90, 91, 92, 93]"
"       There are several lexical items where the front vowels /i, e/ appear to be in
free alternation in unstressed position. This may be that there is some variation
in their realisation when they do not contrast and consequently there is no risk of
confusion. Hence, the varying orthography between Meryarn and Miryam.
Consider also:
       omaskir- omasker 'children'
       rnikir-mekir 'almond tree""
       kirim-kerim 'head'
       kila(r)+kila(r) 'strong'; kelar 'strength'
       gilar-gelar 'law'
       Nonetheless, one would not want to consider these as a single phoneme as
there are minimal pairs where they do contrast:
       gim'illness'                gem'body'
       mir 'word, language'        Mer 'Murray Island'
       wit 'wrong-doing'           wet 'instrument used for skinning coconuts'                                                                            15
      Ii 'faeces'               le 'person'
Furthermore, even when these are unaccented they can contrast:
      etkir 'undress Plclothes' itkir 'rub off'
      etrum 'come down'         itrum 'bring down'
      emri 'sit down'           imri 'seat'1.3    Pitch-Accent
       Accent is distinctive in the language as words are contrasted according to
the particular syllable on which accent is placed. There are a number of minimal
pairs which contrast solely through accent placement. In the following examples,
the first set of disyllabic words have the accent on the first syllable whilst the
second, set have it on the second syllable:
                                                         ~      V-V                                             V-V
       tabo 'snake'                                    tab6 'neck'
       kikem 'afternoon'                               kikem 'initially, firstly'
       u ni 'coconut juice'                            uni 'fish sp.'
       dikayr 'wait'                                   dikayr 'leave alone'
       isi 'take out Pauc/PlO perf'                    isi 'centipede'
       bager 'type of spear'                           bader 'PlS land'
       What exactly is meant by 'accent'? There is no consensus amongst
linguists who have worked on the language as to what feature or bundle of
features mark the 'accent'. Bartos (1977) refers to the feature as 'stress' but fails to
characterize or define it. McConvell (1983) refers to it as 'pitch-accent' with the
accented syllable being the one carrying high tone/ stress on it. Rigsby (p.c)
maintains that an accented syllable may but need not have high tone.
        In the current corpus of data, isolated lexical items collected through
elicitation have the accented syllable bearing high pitch:
        6mar 'good feeling'              umar village name
        zyawali 'book'                   apkorep 'habit, manner'
        iperedi 'be lying'               imiredi 'be sitting Pr'
        dirsi 'be moored'                dirsir 'prepare'
        dobdob 'fat'                     kepkep 'few'
        datrum 'cut n PlO'               itrum 'bring down'
        However, when certain inflections or clitics are added or simply within
discourse, the accented syllable can shift place or the previous accent bearing
syllable will no longer carry high pitch:
ex.     le-      gize
        person-PIA
        'people (A)'
                                                                                16
      >Wayer pit         le -   gize
          place    point person-PIA
      [    - -                   - _]
      'people of Wayer point'
ex.   kirgir 'youth', makrem 'unmarried man'
      > kirgir makrem
      [              -]
      'male youth'
ex.   ereg 'eat flesh'
      >ka able lar irg-         i
       1SgA Det fishO eat flesh-Pf
      [    -                       -]
       'I ate the fish'
       Should the definition of accent be altered to include these alternations or
should the definition of accent remain correlated with high tone with details
given elsewhere as to its interaction with other features such as intonation? It
would seem more useful in a descriptive work to keep accent as a discrete
linguistic category specifying elsewhere the alternations.
       Accent placement is restricted to the first or second syllable of a
phonological word. Thus, in disyllabic or polysyllabic words, there is a fall in the
pitch following the accented syllable:
ex.    bakyamu
       [ - - -]
      'Go!'
ex.   e bakyamu-da
      [-   - - - -]
      '(He/she) went.'
ex.   wi bakyamu-daryey
      [-       -           -]
      'They (2) went.'
ex.   wi abi et6mert-idere
      [- ___ - - - __ ]        'They (few) showed him.'
       Note that the syllable in which the pitch falls from mid to low may be
significant. It could be signalling what is sometimes referred to as secondary
stress, i.e. high pitch = primary accent, falling pitch = secondary accent. Further
research is required in this area.
        It is not the case that the secondary accent corresponds to a morphological
boundary. For example:
                                                                             17
      bodomolam 'exchange, payment'
      [- -   -    ]
       (contrast with, for example, bakyamuda)
       There are several monosyllabic homophonous pairs whose accent
placement differs when an inflection is added. McConvell (1983) noted that the
lexical item pim 'finger, grasshopper' carried different accent placement when
the ergative inflection was added:
       pim-ide 'fingerA'
       pim-ide 'grasshopperA'
       McConvell also points out the difference in the vowel quality (1,1..). The
variations in accent placement cannot be the result of the vowel given similar
alternations in the accent placement when inflections are added with the item lag
'mosquito, smell':
       lag-ide 'smellA'
       U.g-ide 'mosquitoA'
       McConvell proposes a morphophonemic notation by transcribing those
items retaining accent placement on the root with the accent diacritic:
       U.g 'mosquito'              lag 'smell'
       pim 'grasshopper'           pim 'finger'
       This proposal seems more like a 'trick' than a solution as both types have
high pitch when there are no inflections:
ex.     debe U.g      pe dike
       good smells Deix n PIS be(name?)
        'That is a nice smell.'
ex.    ka able lag              as6- Ii
        lSgA Det mosquitoO hear-Preslmpf
        'I am listening to the mosquito.'
        The retention or loss of the root accent when suffixed by an inflection may
be due to an historical development.","[26, 27, 28, 29]"
"5.     Sociolinguistic Notes.
       A special form of the language is used for grieving or expressing sympathy
for an individual. This speech style is called nas+nas rnir 'sorry talk' (lit: sad Adj
word) and only affects verbs by either changing the first vowel to /o/ or /u/ or by
inserting a bilabial glide between the initial consonant and vowel; e.g. dali 'be
Primpf' ---> dwali 'be Prlmpf in sorry talk'; digern 'walk' ---> dogern 'walk in
sorry talk' (see the section in Phonology on glides p. 10).
       Whilst all Meryam speakers on Mer can talk some Creole, it is not the case
that all Creole speakers can talk Meryam. For this reason, community affairs are
generally conducted in Creole. For example, when council candidates were
giving their election speech during my stay, only one out of six candidates
delivered their speech in Meryam.
       Furthermore, even with Meryam speakers, there is code-switching
depending upon the topic and addressee. In the family home, parents often
address their children in Creole, switching to Meryam when they want to discuss
something which does not concern them. However, many younger people in
their twenties and below, only have a passive knowledge of Meryam and,
consequently, always converse in Creole. It is only speakers in their mid-thirties
and above, with a sufficient grasp of Meryam, who can converse in it.
       The language of education is English with Creole used informally in the
classroom for giving instructions or explaining difficult concepts. Meryam is
taught for only half an hour or an hour a week in the school and is funded by the
Commonwealth government.
       The Creole spoken on Mer (and on the other Eastern Islands, see Shnukal
1988) does have a high proportion of Meryam lexical items. Similarly, speakers of
Meryam also employ Creole words although the proportion may vary
enormously from speaker to speaker and topic to topic. There are sometimes
preferences for words from a particular language and meanings can differ from
one language to another. For example, the Creole kinship terms sisi 'sister' and
bala 'brother' are used far more frequently than the Meryam term berbet 'sibling'.
An example of semantic shift is the instance of two children from one family
who use Creole terms rnarni 'mummy' and dadi 'daddy' for their parents and the
Meryam terms am.a 'mother' and bab 'father' for their grandparents instead of
the Meryam term kayed or ata for 'grandparent'.
       Not all speakers of Meryam have the same command and knowledge of
the language and future research must aim at documenting the range and
differences in forms, functions and meanings comparing conservative Meryam
and Creole.",[16]
"                                                                           171
      When it is 3rd person, the situation is somewhat more complex and
speakers have different opinions on what is acceptable or not. Some speakers
allow all three markers i, ya and ge to mark a place distant to the speech act; some
speakers only allow the markers i or ya to mark distance from the speech act,
which suggests that the notion of distance is not crucial to their meanings, and
some speakers only allow the marker ya to mark distance from the speech act:
(4.105) ?e       i    wa- ta- daw-                er        kikem
           3SgS Deix Fut3-Deix-n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf afternoon
        'He will be there (this) afternoon.'
(4.106) e      ya wa- ta- daw-                   er        kikem
        3SgS Deix Fut3-Deix-n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf afternoon
        'He will be there (this) afternoon.'
(4.107) ?e ge wa- ta- daw-                       er
        3SgS Deix Fut3-Deix-n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf

        2SgS Deix Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 3Sg0 Deix-see- Fut2/3
        'He will be there so go see him there.'
        (The speaker is telling the addressee after he has been to see the person
        and told him to stay there.)
      It is obviously not on the basis of so few examples that one can make hard
and fast generalizations but there is at least scope for suggesting direction of
change. What all speakers do agree on is that the form i is associated with a place
close-by and a time in the immediate future:
(4.108) ka mena i-          ka n(a)- aw-                  er
         lSgS still Deix-lSgS 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf
         mari na-       wkayr-er
         2Sg01/2Sg0-wait- n Prlmpf
         'I will stay here now (and) wait for you.'
       The form ya is associated wih a distant place or a later time (see later section
on ya for evidence of this):
(4.109) ka ya- ka na- bakyamu- lu                    idim-     ge
         lSgS Deix-lSgS Futl-Sg/DualS go-FutlSg morning-Loe
         'I will go there tomorrow.'
       The form ge is used with 1st or 2nd person and a specific location (see
examples 4.110 - 4.112).
       Some speakers are re-analysing i in terms of a temporal feature alone, i.e. it
only refers to a proximate time and it does not matter where the event takes place
The marker ya is not undergoing any change and refers to events that are either
distant in time or space. The marker ge is undergoing some kind of change
although the precise nature of the change is unclear; it is possibly starting to be
regarded in terms of a modal marker, i.e. I know this definitely will happen.","[182, 183]"
"5.5.3 Reported Speech.
       No examples of indirect speech have been collected in the data despite the
fact that there are some 150 pages of texts. The most common strategy is to report
speech directly. A complement kega can optionally be used to introduce the
speech act. It may be related to the following deictic markers: ke(y) 'in this
manner, way' + ga 'and then, and also there':

      The negation particle nole - ne (these are in free variation) 'not, no' must
precede the verb and typically occurs following the first accented element in the
utterance to negate an event:

        'Don't dob him in.'
      The negation particle can sometimes occur at the beginning of a clause
which is intonationally dependent on the preceding clause:

        (Dewmer, p209, section7)5.7    Valency Changes.
       In the section on the intransitiviser ba-, the prefix was shown to make
transitive verbs intransitive either by making the A the S argument as it is
reflexive, or by making the 0 the S argument of the intransitivised verb. This
process is exploited in the language for a number of So/listic effects.
       The intransitiviser can be used with events affecting inalienable body parts
where the Sis reflexive and the non-S argument, if there is one, is either
interpreted as a non-syntactic argument or as part of the verb phrase:                                                                          195

            A much larger corpus of data is required to establish what the meaning
     difference is between using the transitive and the intransitive forms. To date,
·,   only events involving body parts have been collected with this kind of case frame
 I     and one could hypothesize that there is a preference for these types to be treated
     in this way because an intransitivised verb allows the 0 to be expressed within
     the verb phrase, making it parallel in form and function to reflexive
     constructions.
            There is an innovation in the use of the intransitiviser bai which is
     sometimes being used for events that are not necessarily reflexive, but rather
     because the same pronominal free form is used. As was seen earlier, the same
     pronominal forms can be used for the reflexive, i.e. oneself, as well as the
     exclusive meaning, i.e. by oneself:
     (5.85) ka imus itw- i kababu
               lSgA beardO shave-Pf Exel
               'I shaved my beard by myself.'
      (5.86) ka kababu imus ba- tw-            i
               lSgS lSgRefl beard Intr-shave-Pf
               'I shaved myself.'
             However, speakers are sometimes making the verb intransitive when it is
     the intensive pronominal function:
      (5.87) ma        mabu        ba- smer-0
               2SgA/S Refl/Excl lntr-see- Fut2/3
               'See yourself - See for yourself.'
             Thus, the presence of the intransitiviser morpheme doe.6 not,in such
      instances) , indicate a reflexive action.It is the result of the pronominal free
      form, marking a reflexive action (i.e. 5=0) and/or an exclusive meaning (i.e.
      nonsyntactic).","[205, 206, 207]"
"Future-NonPresent.
       It is pertinent to begin the discussion on future tense by examining its
prefix forms. These involve the markers wa- for 3rd person and (n)a- for 1st
person.
(3.107) e      wa- ditar-0
         3SgA Fut3-write-Fut2/3
         'He will write (it).'
(3.108) ka d-a-          wtar- e

         3SgS Fut3-be standing-n Pr
         'He will be standing.'
       The future markers are prefixed to both telic and atelic verbs although
when the first person future marker is prefixed to a 1st person atelic stative verb,
it cannot be distinguished from the 1/2Sg/Pl marker given these are
homophonous:
                                                                           109

         lSgS Deix-lSgS 1/2Sg/Pl+Futl-be standing-n Pr outside-Loe
         'I will be standing outside later.'
       The reader might be tempted to regard future markers as discontinuous
morphemes consisting of a prefix and suffix. Such an approach would fail to
recognise that both these prefixes and suffixes can occur with non-future
temporal reference and that it is the combination of these forms which gives
them their future meaning. As such, they can be regarded as co-occurring
morphemes.
       The future is used with all events or states which will begin some time in
the future (with the exception of habitual events as discussed above where the
event is specified as occurring all the time although not necessarily at the time of
the speech act).
(3.111) sogi o- ba- sirik-o

         'The grass will burn.'

         'I am going to dance.'
       It can also be used for events that may have already commenced at the time
of the speech act but are expected to continue for some time. Consider the
following example where the act of eating has already commenced but the
speaker wishes to convey the notion that it will continue to happen. This is in
contrast with the present imperfective where there is no such expectation:

"1)     There is a derivational suffix -kem homophonous with the associative case
suffix which derives adjectives from nouns. Whether or not this is a productive,
semi-productive or lexical device remains to be seen as only two examples have
been collected so far. Its meaning can be roughly glossed as 'characterised by' or
'having the characteristic of':
(2.129) mir- kem le
        word-Ass person
        'a preacher'
(2.130) ged- kem le
        land-Ass person
        'land-owner'2)     Nominals (both nouns and adjectives) can be derived from verbs through
a regular phonological process which involves the initial (consonant plus) vowel
of the verb changing. Some examples of nominalised verbs being used as an
adjective or noun follow:                                                                            52

        cook Adj        things n PIS be(thing)-Pr
        '(It)'s a cooking utensil.'
       As the reader may have noted, the adjectival derivation process can
involve reduplication as well although it is still the same process:
       erap 'buy' verb --> arap noun
       dikasir 'cook' verb--> akasir noun
       The derivational process is as follows:
verbs--------------> nominals
       The initial consonant, if there is one, is deleted.
A stressed word initial vowel /6/ becomes /aw/:
#(C) 6 -------- > # aw
An example is:
        6g 'climb'--> awgog 'the climb' (as well as reduplication of verbal root?)
                            (the derivation might be from: aw(g) 'big'+og 'climb')A stressed word initial vowel /f/ becomes I ay I when it is followed by a single
consonant and /i/. It becomes /aw/ elsewhere:
#(C) r - - - - > #ay / - c 1 i
        ------->#aw I elsewhere
Examples include:
        dfmi 'close'---> aymir+aymir 'closed Adj'
        dfski 'open'---> awskir 'tombstone opening'
(Note that verbs ending with a vowel have /r/ suffixed as well.)A stressed word initial vowel I e/ becomes I a/ if it is followed by a glide and it
remains the same elsewhere:
#(C) e -------> #a I - c [+glide]
     ----------> #e I elsewhere
Examples include:
      ewsmer 'go out, be born'---> awsmer 'birthday'
      eydi 'lie down'---> aydir+aydir lu 'mattress'
      erwer 'learn'---> erwer meta 'school' (lit: learnN+house)(One counter-example has been collected in the data where ew -----> #ew,
 e.g. ewmi 'die'---> ewd+ewd 'deadly' *awd+awd. However, as the derivation
also involves a change in the consonant, i.e. m ---> d, this could be an irregular
or unrelated form.)                                                                              53
A stressed word initial I a/ remains the same:
#(C) a. ---------->#a
An example follows:
         akem 'dip'---> akem 'dippingN'An unstressed initial vowel becomes I a/:
#(C)V ------------>#a
Examples include:
       dirmisir 'start'---> armisir 'beginning'
       ero 'eat'---> aro+aro 'edible'
       akarik 'land'--> akarik 'landing'
       okayret 'break (of dawn)'---> akayret 'daybreak'
       erap 'buy'--> arap le 'vendor'
       dikasir 'cook' ---> akasir le 'cook'

2.2.5 Nominal Compounds.
       Many examples occur in the data of several nouns juxtaposed within a
single phrase. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that these are
compounds and can be categorised into different types, lexical and syntactic. A
comparison will be made between compounds and modified nominals as well as
complex noun phrases involving the genitive construction, to show similarities
and differences. Compounds are the result of a morphological or lexical process
whereas modified nominals, be they adjectives or genitive constructions, are the
result of a syntactic process.","[63, 64, 65, 66]"

                                                                           143
         mena Adverb 'still, continue'

          3SgA still foodO eat-Prlmpf
           'He is still eating.'

           lSgA first       foodO Futl-eat-Futl
           'I will eat first.'
         For some words, it feels intuitively that the adverbial function is primary
with the secondary function having developed from it. Adverbs such as kikem
'firstly', emetu 'already', mena 'still, continue', etc. Unfortunately, there is no
linguistic evidence to either refute or support such a claim.
         Although it is not possible to isolate these words as being uniquely or even
primarily an adverb, their function is clearly adverbial. Adverbs contribute
information about the manner:
(3.253) ma ta-            ba dudum+dudum
           2SgS Deix-go quick
           'Come quickly.'
about the time:
(3.254) Geygi, nako aw nyay+nyay da-                      Ii?
           G.          what big long time n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
           'Why is Geygi so long (away)?'
about the place:
(3.255) abra           nar ta- ba- ytr- i mayk+mayk Wayer-lam
           3SgGen boats Deix-Intr-sink-Pf close            W.-    Abl
           'His boat sank very close to Wayer.'
about the event itself:
(3.256) ...e-         ge emetu ba- yw-i
               3SgS-Deix already Intr-dig-Pf
            '... (but) he had already buried himself.'
         As can be noted from the examples, adverbs covered in this section do not
have any inflections or affixes. (Adverbial phrases do occur as illustrated in the
section on inflections). Their position is relatively free in the sentence although
they tend not to occur in word initial position.
         Several of the words used adverbially appear in reduplicated form. This
might be done for two reasons. It may be to derive an adverb from a noun, i.e.
 dudum-ge 'in haste' (lit: haste-Loe), dudum+dudum 'quickly'; nyay-em 'forever'
 (lit: long time-All), nyay+nyay 'eternally'. Note that since this parallels
 reduplicated forms for adjectives, reduplication could be viewed as a syntactic                                                                            144
process for deriving nouns into modifiers, be they adjectives or adverbs.
However, somewhat similar to adjectives, reduplicated adverbs also imply a
greater intensity, i.e. mayk-e 'dose-by' (lit: close-Loe) versus mayk+mayk 'very
dose-by'. Thus, reduplication is both a syntactic and semantic process for adverbs
as well.","[154, 155, 156]"
"All consonants (except 1) can occur preceded by a palatal glide:

      The following generalizations can be drawn. The same voicing distinction
must be maintained within the cluster, i.e. voiced+voiced, voiceless+voiceless,
*voiced+voiceless, *voiceless+voiced.

rk      erkep 'eye'
rg      irgi 'eat flesh Pf'
        Judging by the number of examples collected in the data, the frequency of
the lateral plus stop cluster is very low. These clusters (i.e. lateral plus
consonant) may be the result of borrowing as of the eight examples collected, two
refer to names of bananas- a source of potential word loan as different types of
bananas were/ are exchanged, possibly resulting in the name being introduced
into the language from the banana supplier /linguistic group.
  The lack of lateral plus voiced alveolar cluster, i.e. /Id/, is probably just a gap.
For the cluster /lk/, only one example was obtained from Ray's dictionary.

       No examples occur where there is a voicing contrast in the cluster. The
fact that it is the same restriction as with a stop plus stop cluster suggests this is a
semi-generalized rule.

       rl     paserlam 'from the hill'
              No cluster /Ir/ has so far occurred in the data. The reader should note that
       in verbs where the root is suffixed with a morpheme marker commencing with
       I di or /1/, the verb will omit the final Ir I if it has one, e.g. deketir 'take a quick
       look, glance'-> deketi-da Pf, *deketir-da; et6mer- 'show'-> a-t6me-lu FutlSg, *a-
       t6mer-lu. This suggests that a distinction needs to be made between verbs and
       non-verbs when examining the phonotactic structure of the language.

4.2.1 pe. pa - present; ge, ga -nonpresent
              The present deictic markers pe and pa contrast with the non-present
markers ge and ga. Whilst the former can only be used with events or states
which coincide with the speech act utterance or precede it at a time earlier on the
same day, the latter are used with events or states which occur prior to the day or
following the utterance. To illustrate this contrast, consider the examples below.
In 4.1, reference is made to a location marked by the form ge when it is associated
with events or states that occurred a day earlier to the speech act (abgergerge
'yesterday') and by the form pe when it is associated with events that occurred
prior to the speech act (able idimge 'this morning'). Although reference is being
made to the same location, different forms must be used to demonstrate the
different time reference. Similarly, in 4.2, one group of fish caught the previous
day is contrasted with a group of fish caught earlier in the day:

         which were hanging and this morning, I went there where I saw they had
         all stolen themselves away.'
 (Note that the markers that concern us here are not the case inflections suffixed to
nominals which in some cases are homophonous with the deictic markers,
e.g. -ge locative inflection: abgerger-ge 'yesterday-loc'. Those that are deictic
 markers are clearly labelled as such. In addition, the reader should not get
 confused with verbal deictics and non-verbal deictics. These can be distinguished
 from one another on the basis that verbal deictics always occur prefixed to the
 verb. The deictic markers in this discussion concern the non-verbal ones.)

"Number Markers for 0 by Suffixes.
       The previous section discussed how suffixes cross-reference A and S
arguments of telic verbs. However, these markers can also cross-reference 0
arguments provided these do not conflict with the number hierarchy which can
be very broadly summarized as Pauc/PlA/O > Sg/DualA/O; that is paucal or
plural number 0 arguments can take precedence in the number suffix slot over
singular or dual A arguments. In other words, we find examples of Pauc/PlO
animates being marked by suffixes when there 'are 5~/D~l A an;mates:

         (PluralO>DualA)
       However, there are also isolated instances where animate dual 0 is marked
over and above nonsingular A.

         ' ...They (all) spoke Meryam; they (a few of them) then asked Abob and
         Kos, they told them: we want to change our language, (its) tune.'
         (DualO>non SingularA)
       Several possibilities can be suggested to account for these. This use may
reflect changes happening in the language such as that documented by
McConvell (1983; 26) who notes that there is 'loss of the trial/plural number
distinction intransitives' amongst speakers under about forty years old and so,
the number hierarchy is sometimes not applied. (This is less likely to be the
reason given that both of these utterances were by speakers in their fifties and
above.) It may be that such features are more sensitive to pragmatic features or
that indefiniteness in number for A is tolerated when its number and identity
have been clearly established elsewhere. A larger corpus of data monitoring these
factors would be desirable.
       In addition, the number hierarchy needs to be explored with respect to di-
transitive verbs where there are potentially two O's competing for cross-reference
marking in the suffix slot. It can be tentatively stated that when this is the case,
the animate 0 will take precedence over the inanimate 0:
(3.218) peybri le-          gize komet le        nam na-        kwar-           da
          name person-PIA name personO turtleO 3n SgO-give Sg/Dual0-P£Pl
          'The 'peybri' clan members gave the 'komet' clan members, a turtle.'
 (The above example is interesting as it also illustrates how overt lexical number
marking for A will permit the cross-reference marking on the verb to include
number of A and 0.)
       Although the hierarchy for animates over inanimates sugges1sa loss of
information for number of 0, the reader is reminded that forms of the verb roots
 themselves often carry such information:
                                                                           133
