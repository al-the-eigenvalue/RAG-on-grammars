"3. This material     is interesting    on several   grounds,    if not for
its value as a source of linguistics        information.      The document
in question    is a MISURASATA manifesto,      a political      declaration
which  expressed    the  claims  of   the  indigenous    people,    at that
time,  against   the Sandinista    government.    It is interesting       to
note how there was a need to write the document symbolically in
Rama.       There         were           few    real         speakers               of     Rama        among     the       signers         of                                                             24

  the document.   It could be that the 'bad transcription’ is partly
  a reflection of the kind of Rama that was being dictated, Rama of
  some        weak       semi-speakers.                     As      will      be     mentioned            later,           one       of    the
 effects of the lack of any strictly linguistic knowledge coming
 out of the contact with this fieldworker resurfaced as a
                                                             belief
 that Rama was simply too strange to be written and studied.","[37, 38]"

three       different                questions               -     those        of        language            change,        language
death and languages    in contact - the division must be recognized
as   no  more than    an    artificial   one  for  the  sake of   data
presentation.   These    issues   are all aspects of the same general
issue       of    acknowledging                  the     historical                   and     sociological              dimensions
ef    the    language              under     study,               and    the     Unavoidable                  fact     of    language
change       and     adaptation              in        any        linguistic               description.
Placing   Rama  in    its   proper  context   is particularaly   important
since the language is well known for being a threatened language
and it is expected that it already carries with it marks of its
impending demise.        If a grammatical description of Rama is going
to   be  useful    to     comparativists    interested  in  cChibchan,   it
certainly  falls                   on      the  fieldworker to  sort through the data  as
much as possible                    in     order to distinguish characteristics that may
be attributed  to                     its    being a Chibchan language from those that
may be attributed                      to   its being caught in an accelerated pace of
change.",[268]

of its use in relative     clauses  is that   it means  that Rama has a
device   to  mark   what   relative   clauses    have  in   common    with
constructions   expressing   old,  presupposed   information.     One  can
find   discussions   in the  literature  of  the  structural overlap
between relative clause structure and wh-question or clefting and
attempts at explaining why this should be so, by appealing to an
overlap of functional domain.     In some way, this is the Rama way

the    difference       of     structure    signals    a   difference    of
interpretation at this point.          Both these constructions with the
full  lexical   verb bating can take either the same or different
subjects.    When   the    two    subjects  are   coreferential,   another
possibility                    arises;         that             of      a     suffixed            ‘serialized!                   bating

  For Rama   Cay,  the   key  concept   to keep    in mind  is                                                       the    notion    of
  ethnically   associated    language    and   the  fact that                                                       the     goal   need
  not be speaking     fluency   for all,    but knowledge   of                                                      and     about   the
  language.        71     To        this        end,        one    objective               was     to       create         linguistic
  materials        on    the         language              with     the    help        of        the    Cane        Creek       people.
  At  the   request   of  the  Rama  speakers                                              of   the  project,   varius

  songs     and    prayers               for     the        school        and        the     church,           and         an   elemen-

 argument           ellipsis            causing            clauses              to     exhibit          a       variety          of    word
 orders.
 In    natural        texts,             there        is        a    strong           tendency              for       a    transitinve
 clause   to          have    less               than    the               two   full              NPS   in   the                surface
 structure           of   clauses                in   those                languages               which    allow                surface
 ellipsis           of main arguments. Thus                               within Rama discourse it is rare
 to find           clear SOV clauses since                                pronominal and zero anaphora is
 common. (4)         kiiknadut            apaik-i

"Although    Lehmann gave a different   form for  ‘cannot',  he  most
likely   did not have the correct  analysis of the  form he listed.
The word aaningka which he claimed to be a ‘helping verb' meaning
‘cannot' turns out to be, in contemporary Rama, the                                                     negative form
of the quantifier ningka 'plenty, enough', which he                                                     listed as the.

 2.7.     Conclusion
 The      topic       of         negation           in      Rama        is     an     interesting            one        which
deserves   further                 study.  There                 are a great variety   of forms,    but
their  actual   use                has not been                 completely  established yet.     [It is
also one of the                   few areas of grammar for which there is earlier
documentation.                   A thorough study of the negation forms found in
natural        speech,            such    as        narratives,              remains        to   be    done.       Another
topic to be researched     is the possible                                          influence of the contact
language,  Creole English,    on the use of                                         these negative morphemes
in the Rama of today.","[200, 201]"

 Today,              negative             possession                 is         likely       to            be     expressed         with      a
 negated             form     of        the       verb,     for           example,          kwaakar,              as    in:
  (54)              naas nganguk aa kwaakar

                    ‘I have no money'
 There are three negative existentials in comtemporary Rama:
                                                                    kliin
 (a borrowing    from    English  ‘clean'),  mahaling   and taama/tahma.
 This  means  that    there   are three ways   of saying   'I don't
 anything/ there is nothing':                                        have
 (55)           yaadar                    kliin

Often     the        future        meaning            is        not       overtly            expressed               and     a     ‘present!

introduced as a member of the set of tense markers are its final
position   in   the  verb   form,   and  its  future   meaning.     On both
structural    and   semantic    grounds,   it  appears    to  belong   to  a
specified set:
(21)       verb        +     ASPECT        +    TENSE            ¢
                                                -1                   ""present!
                                                -u                   ""past!

However,         one   must allow                      for  an assymetry                                in the    system,                which
sets the         suffix -ut apart                      from the others.                                 -—-ut appears to                behave
differently   from the                         other tense markers   in the negative                                                     cons-
truction  formed with                          the suffixed tahma/taama.   While the                                                     tense
markers         -i    and     ~u     are        not        used           in        the     presence            of     this        negative
morpheme,            the     suffix        -ut       may        follow               it.         The     past        tense       interpre-
tation  of            the fdéllowing example comes                                         from        the context not                   shown

"To     call        ba-      a        derivational      prefix         might   be   a   matter        of     debate
within         a     theoretical                framework        of   morphology       such     as        the   one
presented in Bybee (1985) or Scalise (1986) in which the claim is
made that derivational   morphology  is more   internal   to the word
than inflectional morphology.    The alternative is to consider the
relational preverb phenomenon as compounding,     or idiom formation
of the   kind found in English with verbal      particles   as in the
pattern:
              he     call        -    ed                    up
                    Root         -    Inflectional          lexical/derivational
Another example of such use of                              relational preverb is found in the
aspect marker baakar,    composed                           of the relational preverb ba- plus
the verb aakar  'to be',   as in:
(57)           tiiskama                paun     baakar-i
              child     cry                  ASP-TNS
              ‘the child is                 crying'
The phenomenon   is one of progressive lexicalization of relational
preverbs,  the above cases representing the instances of relation-
al preverbs   most  lexicalized.   See chapters 8 and 9 for a more
thorough discussion of this phenomenon.",[87]

The     consolidation             of    the     mainland     Ramas    at     Cane        Creek        works       both
to the   advantage  and the disadvantage  of                               the maintenance  of                      the
language.    On the positive  side, it means                               that more speakers                       are
now concentrated   in one location,   where they form a more viable
linguistic  community,   since almost   half of the people  of Cane
Creek are fluent speakers  (16 out                           of 29).     On the negative    side,
this   concentration  also  means                            more    use   of  Creole    in    the
interaction with the non-speakers                           and more exposure to Creole for
the     children      of    the        Rama     speakers.","[26, 27]"

alternative  available  is to consider an  ‘apparent   time'    study,
one in which contemporary speakers representing various stages of
language         loss  are compared     (see Dorian 1981,   Hill   1983, Schmidt
1985  for        studies   including  this approach).     Possibilities   for an
apparent         time  study   are developing   as more   speakers   are located
and  contacted,    and  the   commuity   spirit   is one      of support    and
interest    in the   project.     Even   so,  the   study    will   always   be
limited   by   the  low  number    of  speakers,    and   the   even   smaller
number of speakers that are able to participate in the work.                 At

Rama   native    speakers    (possibly  two),   older    non-native     fluent
speaker   (one),   all  of the jungle mainland      community of speakers,
and  a   sampling    of   'rememberers'   from  the    island  of   Rama    Cay
(possibly   five or six).     (See chapter   2 for a profile     of the last
speakers of Rama)2.2.    Initial             observations
The     data          available            so      far           consist           mostly           of    the         linguistic
documentation                collected  from  two speakers,   a near-native   fluent
older   speaker                and  a  native ‘younger   speaker.     In  addition,
recordings             of     vocabulary               lists           were        made         with       several            native
speakers         from        the    jungle         in       the        winter           of    1986.        The        recordings
were   made   as  an   attempt    to assess   the   extent   of     linguistic
variation     and   possible    dialect   identification,       and     can   be
considered    as providing     data  on differences     between      older   and
younger,    monolingual   and bilingual     speakers   as well.          Little
data    were         actually         recorded              as     most    speakers                 appeared          to    be    very
bewildered            by    their     first        experience                 as    linguistic             informants.
Further  information is being   gathered  through  comments                                                                   volun-

own speech and that of others.    Particularly interesting in this
respect   is how  the  native  speaker   has  started  volunteering
information on the differences she can point out between her form
of    speech         and    that     of    some        of        the   older        monolingual                 speakers          with
whom    she     interacts            on    a daily               basis.","[272, 273]"

Although Conzemius did not mention the existence of an aar nega-

a future negative marker aarna,   in which  the negative particle
aar can easily be identified.2.3.     tahma,          taama
taama   is,   with    the  negative  imperative   form   arka,   the  only

There  is a general    semantic    shift   from postposition to verbal
prefix   which manifests    itself     slightly  differently with each
postposition,  although always      in the same direction of semantic
bleaching.","[136, 137]"

2.5.    Negative         imperative:            arka
This    negative          marker        was     already            presented            in    the        discussion           of

preverbally,         often        in    clause         initial        position:

 arka    is     most     likely     a     compound      of     two      morphemes               ar-ka.           The    first
 morpheme           resembles       the     ar      negative         marker         mentioned               by     Lehmann
 and the first part of the putative future negative marker arma of
 Conzemius.     The -ka segment is also found in angka,  the negative
 modal   'cannot'   presented  below. The ka resembles  the ablative
 postposition ka. 2.6.    angka
Neither        Lehmann        nor   Conzemius         list     angka.          It        is    a    model        with    the
negative            meaning     'cannot'          (pronounced           kyan        in        creole)       used        very
frequently  in            the   speech  of contemporary   Rama                            speakers.  It is a
free  morpheme              used   preverbally,   and   often                             in  clause-initial

There  are many forms    of negation  in Rama,   some   free, some bound;
some  preceding   the  element  they negate,   some   following   it.   The
analysis  and inventory of the forms and their use varies         somewhat
from Lehmann   (1914),  to Conzemius   (1927),  to the present research
with contemporary speakers.","[188, 189]"

which claims  ownership of                                that island.   The alternative plan of
building  a new settlement                                 on the mainland   is not yet  feasible
because of the                still       prevailing insecurity due to the war.    It                                                 is
also  unpopular                with        many  islanders who  simply do not   want                                                  to

3.4.      Derived    adjectives         with    -tahmaThis negative   suffix is the semantic  opposite                             of the suffix       -wa,
meaning  'without',  corresponding to the ‘suffix                             '-less'.  It,      too,
derives      adjectives  from  nouns in a highly   productive                                 manner,

different morphologically  from the other aspects    of this set in
that it does not have a tense marker.    Its inclusion in this set
of     aspectual               markers     would        be    based     on    the        fact    that    it   expresses

that it        would constitute a homogeneous morphological set with the

characteristic.   Linked                        to this nominal                    characteristic               is the fact
that   the              verb         forms    negated    with    tahma/taama    usually                                 appear
without    a            tense         marker,    as  shown    in examples    (43,44,45)                                 above.
This     is       found         in     the     data        collected         on     contemporary                Rama    and   is
described   in Conzemius    too.     Lehmann, on the other hand,   stated
that the negative taama       was always followed by a tense marker.

were         only two                instances        of the combination                           negation     +   tense,     and
both         occurred               in direct        elicitation data:

This   negative   particle   taama/tahma   may  be  divided  into  two
morphemes tah/taa and ma.      Evidence for this bimorphemic analysis
is   found  in the   occasional   use  of the morpheme   -ma alone  in
contemporary Rama, as a negative existential predicate:
(51)               siiru       ma                        :                           / siiru        kliin

Therefore,  it should be noted again that                                                    although Rama has many
characteristics of a verb final language,
                                                                                            it is not as absolutely
verb        final        as     Turkish           or     Japanese,             as    the     relative            order      of      main
and        subordinate               clauses           shows.
A     possible           exception               to     the       earlier           statement            that     there       are      no
real        strings            of    embedded            clauses         in        Rama    would         be     the    occasional

Another common property of prototypical clause chaining languages
is  that in  such  languages there  exists no alternative  to the
clause        chaining            construction.               All    complex            sentences       are    made     of
chains        of    non-final             clauses          folowed         by     one        final   clause     with         a
finite verb;   there are no                       co-ranking structures,     in                      which complex
sentences  may    have  more                      than   one finite   verb.                          In   Rama,  the
subordinated    clauses   of                      the  type  discussed    here                        coexist   with
co-ranking          structures,              such     as      the    coordinated               structures      and     one
type     of    subordination                 which       is    marked           with     a    free   subordinating
conjunction             and   a    finite        verb.","[227, 228]"

“ut corresponds                     to a        marked strategy where the meaning of future
tense tends  to                     fade        into that  of the modality

"The   overall   feeling    of Rama     speech  is of a certain        sing-song
quality which had been noted in previous writings.               Lehmann talks
about   ‘musical   accent'    and    'singing way'   and presents      rules  of
tone   (pitch)   assignment,      concluding   that   ‘acute   and   grave   are
distributed    alternatingly       throughout    the   sentence!     (1914:12).

The  working    hypothesis          presented   below  owes   much   to Ken Hale
(p.c.).      It   is  based          on  a  transcription   of   two   narratives
recorded       by    a   native   speaker.      The   general
                                                       taken        approach

claim that Rama stress   is an alternating  stress,  assig ned     over
binary feet, establishing that the metrical unit of
binary foot.                                           Rama    is   the
              Associated with each foot is a stress.
All    heavy        syllables     (CVV,      CVC)     have    the     value       of        a       foot.
Phonetically,  the stress is distributed                     over    the   foot        as       a   whole
in these syllables,  as indicated below:(12)    a.

Sequences      of   two   consecutive    open                     syllables   also         constitute  a
foot.   In     this   case,   the stress    is                    on the  initial         branch of the
foot:

generally      reduced,         losing          its    prominent        stress.         Another         way     to
say this is that          the    final          foot    of    a   sequence       of    adjacent     feet        is
extrametrical:

22. It is also well       documented that the motivation to         retain a
language is usually      the fact of a minority within the          minority
and   that the   average group   members   themselves   are not   interested
in    language   maintainance    efforts   per   se,  although    they   will
participate more willingly        in non-linguistic cultural activities

context.   Some of the topics mentioned in this chapter are given
as a preview of topics of interest which are further developed in
later chapters.   Other topics are raised here in order to settle
that they are not of particular interest in the grammar of Rama.","[40, 41]"

morphosyntactic                  features        of    the     language,                      as    published       in        Craig
1986.    By the winter of 1986, Nora Rigby                                              had        convinced other Rama
speakers    to join the project.    During                                              the        winter,  1986,  field
season,         efforts       were       concentrated              on     gathering                  information          on    the
last     speakers            of Rama,           and on beginning the collection of data
from     a native            speaker.           Most of the interviews were conducted by
Barbara         Assadi,           the     consultant               for        the         project,         who     was         well
known      to        those        interviewed.               During            subsequent                trips,          in     the
summers         of 1986       and 1987 and the winter of 1988,  work advanced on
several         fronts;        more data  were collected from the two principal
linguistic   informants,   Nora  Rigby                                             and   her  daughter-in-law

"In     some cases,  the                    difference   could be analyzed as simply                                           a       case

suffixes associated with the notion of transitivity:         they do not
have intransitive vs transitive       sets of tense/aspect markers     or
stem  final    transitive/intransitive    vowels  like  those    found in
Mayan languages,    for instance.   The issue of subject marking will
be worth    considering   in further research    in light   of the fact
that other Chibchan     languages have been claimed     to be ergative
