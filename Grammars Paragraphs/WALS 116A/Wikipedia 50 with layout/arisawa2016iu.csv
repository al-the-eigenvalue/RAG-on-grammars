3.3.4.3 Polar questions in rising and falling intonations
         In polar questions (i.e. Yes-No question), there are two kinds of intonation: (i)
the rising intonation superimposed on the interrogative particle fai /fai˦/ realised in
[fai˦˥] or [↗ fai] and (ii) the falling intonation superimposed on a statement sentence
without any question word. (For the use of /fai˦/ as a disjunctive particle ‘or’, see
§18.2.4).
         The first kind is exemplified in (131) and its prosody visualised in Figure 41: (131)      Naaiv/      yiem     Yih.bunc     daaih    ↗ fai?

                      Figure 41. Rising question intonation of /↗ fai/         The second kind of polar questions have the falling intonation regardless of in
what tone the utterance ends. Examples (132a-b) show a question and an answer to
it. Figure 42a is a question and Figure 42b is an answer repeating the latter half of the
question ending with the same statement aspect particle nyei /ɲei˦/ which is Tone 1.","[222, 223]"

officials to learn the language in order to go into Iu Mien villages in the northern
provinces to take census, serve for public health and help assimilate to Thai society.
It provides basic conversational phrases and vocabulary. An interesting aspect is the
inclusion of basic medical terms and questions to ask about one’s health in view of
helping the under-privileged people of remote areas in accessing government services.
Given the vocabulary and conversational sentences written in Thai script, Arisawa
(2011c) has investigated the transfer value of Chop-Kacha’anat’s writing system by
asking two questions: (a) Does the writing system help Iu Mien children to read and
write Standard Thai?, and (b) If an adult Mien who is already literate in Thai picks up
an Iu Mien book written in this writing system, how easy is it for him/her to read and
understand it using Thai alphabet’s rules? The answer to the first question was “yes”;
it teaches them Thai system, not Iu Mien. The answer to the second question was as
follows:
    Iu Mien who learn how to read and write Iu Mien by this Yao Conversation Lesson
     will lose 20 % of consonant phonemes,58
    will lose 30 % of tone,
    will have to cope with irregular spellings and lose many contrastive features in
     words,
    will be reminded of making preglottalised nasals distinct
         Nonetheless, it is not for Iu Mien to learn literacy but for the Thai officials “to
understand them” (การเข้าใจของชาวเขา) for their welfare.","[117, 118]"

3.3.4.4 Superimposed intonations: falling question intonation
       One of the difficulties a learner whose mother tongue is English tends to
experience is the falling intonation in a question. The question particle saah /saˑ˧˩/ for
a question expecting an affirmative response has a falling tone or Tone 2 as in (133):

the head noun in relation to its modifier biouv /pʲəʊ˦˥˧/ ‘fruit’ in the sequence biouv-
ndiangx. On the other hand, it is odd to ask (ii) Naaiv haaix nyungc biouv? /naːi˦˥˧ haːi˨˧
ɲuŋ˩ pʲəʊ˦˥˧/ [DEM what kind fruit] “What kind of fruit is it?” about biouv-ndiangx,
showing that biouv is not a semantic head. Thus, N2 is identified as the semantic head
by asking in the frame haaix nyunc X? [what kind X] ‘What kind of X?” When the
question is applied to N1, the question cannot be answered and thus reveals that the
focus of the question (i.e. N1) is not a head but a modifier.
        Taking into an account Matisoff’s (1982:53)(see §8.2.2) argument that
relationship between “morphological compounds” and “syntactic constructions” is a
“continuum” with recognition of the “intermediate” nature in-between, the
constructions that have the surface similarity of the nominal head modified by a verb,
i.e., (iii), (iv) and (v)(indicated by a dotted bracket), may be considered to have the
intermediate nature as shown in
Table 39. The differences between them is that (iii) and (iv) have tone sandhi, thus
being compounds whereas (v) without it, thus deemed to fall into a group of noun
phrases.
Table 39 also shows that the structures (i), (ii), (v) – (xi) are premodification (i.e. left-
branching) constructions and (iii) – (v) are postmodification (i.e. right-branching)
constructions in relation to the semantic head.","[487, 488]"

analysis on English questions with falling intonation contour (Bloomfield 1933:92, 114-5, 171).",[700]
"That is to say, recognising that names have both “the referring function” and “the
describing function”, Searle prioritises the former over the latter.
       The referring function of proper names is advocated by John Stuart Mill (1843)
as summarised by Searle (1971:134) in that “proper names do not have senses, they
are meaningless marks; they have denotation but no connotation”. Furthermore, “a
proper name [is] to refer and not to describe; a proper name predicates nothing and
consequently does not have a sense” (Mill’s position described by Searle (1971:135)).
This position claims that proper names refer to and denote objects.
       On the other hand, those who take proper names in their “describing function”,
like Frege (1903), argue that they have senses. For them “a proper name is a kind of
shorthand descriptions” (Searle 1971:136). This position is said to hold the principle
of identification: “if both the speaker and the hearer associate some identifying
description with the name, then the utterance of the name is sufficient to satisfy the
principle of identification, for both the speaker and the hearer are able to substitute
an identifying description. The utterance of the name communicates a proposition to
                                              259
the hearer” (ibid. 140). In this position the function of “identifying description” is also
termed as the function of “predication”.
         Debating between the two sharply contrasted functions of proper names,
namely the referring function (after Mill) and the describing function (after Frege),
Searle announces his stance that it is “a sort of compromise between Mill and Frege”
as follows:          My answer, then, to the question, ‘Do proper names have senses?’ —if this
          asks whether or not proper names are used to describe or specify
          characteristics of objects— is ‘No’. But if it asks whether or not proper
          names are logically connected with characteristics of the object to which
          they refer, the answer is ‘Yes, in a loose sense of way’ (Searle 1971:139).","[295, 296]"

          description of the final-pitch that is falling. In Iu Mien this
          intonation occurs in a polar interrogative, a question with the final
          particle /saːɁ˧˩/ (saah/saaqh) and a certain tag-question with the
          final particle /ɔɁ˧˩/ (orqc) expecting a positive answer. Note,
          however, that in the ‘Unified (Roman-based) Script’ of Iu Mien,
          the regular question mark /?/ is used for both questions with rising
          and falling pitches.

                                    ABSTRACT
       This is a grammar of Iu Mien language, spoken by some 46,000 Iu Mien people
in Thailand, which has been derived from the data collected by the author whilst living
among the villages of Chiang Rai and Phayao provinces between 1994 – 2015. The
thesis comprises three parts: (i) the onomastics found in Chinese-written documents,
literature review, Thailand’s National Language Policy draft, (ii) the grammatical
descriptions in seventeen chapters, (iii) the representative text and metalanguage in the
appendices.
           The data have been collected through cultural immersion method, the
grammar analysed through judicious monolingual discussions with the native speakers
to secure description on its own terms, and presented with occasional forays into
information structure, Construction Grammar and Cognitive Grammar; occasionally
addressing matters of typology.
       A grammatical description of Iu Mien is momentous because the existing
literature is (i) heavily inclined toward historical linguistics, (ii) a grammar written in
English is dated, (iii) many published grammars are sketchy, only written in Chinese,
(iv) a recent reference grammar written in Chinese mostly presents the parts-of-speech
and sentence patterns with no analyses.
       The grammar establishes seven operational principles found in the structure of
Iu Mien:
   (1) Topic-Focus orientation,
   (2) multilayered focus structure with prominence on the sentence final position,
   (3) verb-medial word order, not necessarily SVO,
   (4) versatility of verbs used for aspect, modality, multi-verb constructions, etc.,
   (5) vague distinction across “parts-of-speech”,
   (6) sentence final particles as epistemic grounding elements,
   (7) culturally affected argument structure, i.e. the relationship between verbs and
      noun phrases in a sentence.
      The goal of this thesis is to describe Iu Mien making the grammar accessible both
to linguists and also to those in Iu Mien-speaking communities in Thailand, the US, and
elsewhere; thus all example sentences are interlinearised tri-scripturally, i.e. IPA, the
Romanised script, and the Thai-based Iu Mien orthography.                                           xxx

   Two pieces of wooden or bamboo, about 15 cm in length, are made from one piece that is split in half.
A spirit priest (sai mienh) throws a pair of jaaux down on the floor to see how the two pieces lie. There
are three possibilities how these pieces lie on the floor: (i) both pieces lie face-up (the insides of the split
bamboo facing up, that is, yaangh jaaux), (ii) both pieces lie face-down (yiem jaaux), and (iii) one piece
face-up and the other face-down (saeng jaaux). The spirit priest tells a spirit which of the three choices
he (the priest) wants, then, throws the pair of jaaux down on the floor. As the pieces lie on the floor in
one of the three possibilities, the priest interprets the meaning of what a spirit tells him. If the combination
of lying of jaaux turns out as the priest has told a spirit, the answer from the spirit’s world to him is
correct or affirmative. If the form after throwing differs from what the priest has told to a spirit, he would
interprets that it has not answered him yet and so continues with different questions or performs different
kinds of ceremonies until it will answer.

18.2.4 Disjunctive Coordination, fai ‘or’
          The third construction in coordinating clauses is disjunctive coordination. The
“yes-no” interrogative is expressed by the sentence final question particle fai with a
sharp rising intonation. However, when the question particle fai is used in the middle
of two clauses, the reading is ‘or’. In the latter case, fai is pronounced with its original
tone, i.e., mid-level tone. The pattern of coordination is:
     CL1 fai CL2 ‘CL1 or CL2’
          See the example (1000-1-2):
                                                                  743

        Unlike the distinction between the clause level coordinating conjunction yaac
‘and’ and the NP level coordinating conjunction caux ‘and’, fai ‘or’ can be used at both
levels. That is, the coordination [NP1 fai NP2] ‘NP1 or NP2’, besides the above-
exemplified [CL1 fai CL2], is possible.
        For the high-rise intonation of the question particle fai, see §3.3.4.3 and §14.2.","[779, 780]"

3.3.4.2 Keeping the original tone of question word haaix
       Similarly to the description of /haːi˨˧/ above, content questions ending with
the interrogative word /haːi˨˧/ (haaix) ‘what, where’ keep its underlying tone. In a
question /miŋ˧˩ haːi˨˧/ (Mingh haaix?) [go where] ‘Where are you going?’, the pitch at
the end of the word /haːi˨˧/ ‘where’ (Tone 5 /˨˧/) ends with the approximately same
height of the first word /miŋ˧˩/ ‘go’ (Tone 2 /˧˩/) (137.6Hz) as in Figure 39.",[221]

           The mid-range demonstrative pronoun naaic /naːi˩/ (close to the hearer) ‘that’
can be used as a topic marker. It is often followed by a phonological pause. The
original referential function of the demonstrative seems to be extended to present or
show the topic, followed by comment, predication, or explanation. An illustration is

           A clause followed by naaic is both topicalised and treated as if it was a big
noun phrase. This use of the demonstrative can be termed as nominalising-naaic.

A comment on the succession of two occurrences of hnangv is necessary: at the end of
(697-2) and at the beginning of (697-3). In (697-2) the coordinated expression [kungx
+ CL + hnangv] means ‘only CL’, where kungx emphasises an adverb hnangv (cf. §9.5).
Thus, hnangv ‘only’ in (697-2) is different to hnangv ‘like’ in (697-3).
       It should be remembered that the original meaning of naaic is ‘that (closer to
the hearer/addressee)’. This referential function and the topicalising function are well
illustrated in an exchange of question and answer. The one who asks a question may
pick up an item that he/she wants to ask of the other party as in (698-1). And the one
who answers a question may pick up a question that is asked by his/her conversation
partner and topicalise it as in (698-4): (698-1)   Mienh           gorngv           [saax            yuoqc                 zei             gitv]    naaic aeqv

       Some questions, other than Wh-questions, are also expressed by particles
placed at the end of a sentence. For example, Longx nyei fai?⤴ [be.well STATIVE.ASPECT
INTERROGATIVE] ‘Are you well?’ (an English approximate of “How are you?”) or Longxnyei saah¿⤵ [be.well STATIVE.ASPECT INTERROGATIVE] ‘You are fine, aren’t you?’ These
interrogative SFPs and other interrogative pronouns will be presented in Chapter 14.","[289, 290]"
"
         Two questions may be raised:
   Did the “Sea Crossing Odyssey” precede or follow the “Mountain Crossing”?
   How did the Iu Mien get the knowledge of houv nyungc ‘to pledge vow (to spirits)’
    or heuc mienv ‘to call on spirits’ for the first time in the middle of the sea since
    they claim that they had practiced none of these before setting out to the sea (2-
    )?
    5
         At this moment there is no answer to the second question though several Iu
Mien themselves have raised this.
         As for the first, our tentative assumption is that the “Sea Crossing Odyssey”
preceded the “Mountain Crossing”, basing on both accounts: the people of Iu Mien
originated on a plain near waters, suffered a drought, experienced a sea voyage,
landed on mountainous regions, were pushed up to the higher grounds, received Jiex
Sen Borngv ‘the Mountain Crossing Passport’, religious customs formalised, were
confined in the mountains with some privileges. The next section attempts to
substantiate this scenario.
         But before that, one last important thing has to be added. It is also known that
there are some groups in Iu Mien that do not possess the story of the “Sea Crossing
Odyssey” though such groups were unknown to Iu Mien in Thailand.",[99]

3.3.4.5 Superimposed intonations: rising question intonation
         In colloquial expression the interrogatives containing haaix /haːi˨˧/ ‘what’ have
a high-rising intonation as haiv similar to Tone 3 /˦˥˧/. This pattern includes haiv nyungc
‘what?’, haiv dauh ‘who?’ haiv zanc ‘when?’ mbuo ziex ‘how many?’ rather than its
underlying Tone 5 /˨˧/. When the question word is pronounced by itself, not followed
by anything, meaning ‘which?’ or ‘where?’, the underlying tone is kept as /˨˧/.
         This high rising intonation pattern is applied to “Wh-questions” whatever tone
the sentence final word is. The following question ends with haiv.nyungc /hai˦˥˧ ɲuŋ˩/
with Tone 8 sentence-finally but the last word is raised sharply as in (135) and Figure

      Figure 45. Rising intonation superimposed on “Wh-question” words       Another superimposing influence on the underlying lexical tone is in the case
of pending particle aeqv /ɛʔ˥/ used to mark a subordinate clause. When it frequently
appears in a long connected discourse, the pitch of Tone 7 /˥/ is slightly lower than
its underlying tone. This largely depends on the speed of the utterance. The slower
the speech is, the higher is the tone close to the underlying tone.","[225, 226, 227]"

         While the phrase weic haaix diuc is a formal way to ask for reason, a more
direct question can be used as a colloquial expression, namely, zoux haiv.nyungc [do

meih aengx zoux? ‘Why are you making another…?’
         As for “Where?”-question, the topic/subject must occur in the first place in the

In the question phrase yiem haaix /jem˦ haːi˨˧/, the second syllable never changes to

           ‘(You say) so?’
This is regarded by the native speakers as a question. This kind of question should be
called a mirrative question.
         For other mirative questions in Iu Mien, consider Purnell’s analysis:          fungc [Contraction of feix-nyungc or fih nyungc] Var: fiungc. Adv. ‘how
          then, how possibly, how come, why.’ Usg: Used with a measure of surprise

SVO pattern can occur, as it will be discussed in later chapters, they are in fact, in
terms of pragmatics, NPTOPIC–[Verb–NP]FOCUS. When the NPTOPIC is an A(gent), the second
NP in the FOCUS can most likely be a P(atient). The P(atient) argument NP is much
more naturally and frequently left-positioned as a TOPIC before the verb in a natural
conversational situation. The preposed P argument is often immediately followed by
a topic marker (i.e. lexical or prosodic), thus re-arrangement of them is an [NPTOP /8
NPAGENT–V] pattern, e.g., {rice}TOP / {I} {eat}, (the slash ‘/’ being a mark of left-
positioning or topicalisation). Thus Iu Mien is a topic prominent language.
         In a certain subgroup of clause (i.e. with the verbs of change of state or weather
verbs), the V–NP order (seemingly VS) order is observed, e.g., {fall} {rain}, as opposed
to other single argument clauses which is realised in the NP-V order, e.g., {bird} {fly}.
         Languages without morphological inflections often have versatile use of verbs
and this tendency is obvious in Iu Mien. Besides regular lexical meaning of verbs, a
certain class of verbs can function as words that indicate aspect, modality, and
directional movement. As a result, a sentence may contain a series of verbs, e.g.,
{modal verb} {main verb} {aspectual verb} {directional verb}. Tense is not indicated
in the verb but by adverbial phrases of time, typically placed after the topic and before
the main verb, e.g., {I} {tomorrow} {go} {to market}. Here again topicalisation of
time phrase is possible, e.g., {tomorrow} {I} {go} {to market}.
         It is also important to note that the real language is situated in discourse and
pragmatic contexts of life. In a connected discourse, be it monologue or
conversational, once the topic is established between the interlocutors, i.e.,
contextually accessible, a pronoun referring to it is most likely omitted; a THEME
argument retrievable from context also undergoes ellipsis. Thus Iu Mien is a context-
dependent language. It also heavily utilises varieties of sentence-final particles in
interlocution, indicating content question, polar question, self-question, aspects,
politeness or firmness, mild or strong command, urging, surprise, irritation, hearsay,
and doubt or certainty.","[39, 40]"

Affirming a state of affairs, the assertive/stative aspectual SFP nyei confirms that the
preceding mingh is a verb as in (736):    (736)      Mingh nyei.
               มี่ง        เญย.
               miŋ˧˩       ɲei˦

               WII-p22;00.10.38-9)
            Similarly, another SFP mi’aqv ‘TELIC’ that follows the given form demonstrates
that it is a verb as in (737):
                                                579
 (737)     O:::v!     maa        aeqv   daic      mi'aqv.
           โอ๊:::!    มา         แอ๊ะ   ไต่       หมี่ อ๊ ะ.

           _KMB;00.08.28-32)
         Because both particles occur sentence-finally, it is possible that other elements
come in between them and verbs in a sentence. However, the direct connection of
them with the form in question (e.g. mingh nyei or daic mi’aqv) proves that the given
form is a verb. Especially in the use of mi’aqv there is no doubt about the fact that the
tested element is a verb. On the other hand, a native speaker may also say a sequence
[N + nyei] is possible with the possessive sense of nyei, therefore the N could be
mistakenly deemed to be a verb. Thus, applying the frame [X + nyei] only may not
be enough but both it and the frame [X + mi’aqv] should be used to ensure X is a verb
by passing both tests.","[615, 616]"
"Having perceived this characteristics in this chapter, we are ready to launch
investigations into MVCs, SVCs, and CvPs. But before that, the negation and questions
need to be discussed because they are closely related to modality, which is defined as
“consideration of alternative realities mediated by an authority” (Timberlake
2007:315).",[683]

        The rapport-taking SFP orqc also has a connotation of asking a question but

The disappearing custom that he was talking about was the abstinence from marrying
close relatives. The disagreement is expressed in SFP lov! by a then ninety-three year
old man with regard to a socially unacceptable practice of marrying one’s close kin.
The new-situation-particle (NSIT) aqv (1047-4) for aspect indicates the change of the
past situation when the conscientious people used to admonish such customs to the
new state that people have become careless of it.
        In the investigation of evidentiality in §12.6.1.3 and §12.7, the sentence final
quotative particle norh (REPORT, RPOT) was discussed. It is a hearsay particle. Normally
it quotes a sentence uttered by the 3rd person. However, if norh quotes an utterance
by the 2nd person, it expresses surprise or disapproval, hence mirative use. When it is
applied to the 1st person, it holds the speaker aloof from the sentence.
        First, a typical case of norh quoting the 3rd person’s speech is exemplified in
(1048-1-3): (1048-1)     O::v!      lungh    gorngv
              โอ๊!       ลู่ง     ก๊อง

              ‘“The pig is (too) skinny.’

           Second, an evidential use of the SFP norh can be found in a storytelling
narrative. The narrator uses the SFP norh to mark a report, words or a line spoken by
a participant to indicate that these are only true inside the world of story as in (1049): (1049)       [Nda’maauh.jaauz242 yaac                    haih           gorngv           waac       nyei] norh.

              (ium_20140403_04_SonyHDR-MV1_DA_BungzCunFouv_Nda'maauh
              Jaauz;00.03.17-20)
This SFP keeps the storyteller from committing to be responsible for the animal being
able to speak.
           The double SFPs aqv oc (1034-4) and aqv lov! (1047-4) have been observed but
they did not receive any explanation. A sentence can have two “sentence final
particles” contrary to definition. This is because the SFPs have two main functions: to
mark aspect and modality.
           The SFP oc used in (1034-4) ‘indicate[s] a range of general emphasis, from a
statement of intent to a polite urging in an invitation’ (Purnell 2012:617). The co-
occurrence of two particles consists of the jussive or mild command aqv and the polite
particle oc as illustrated in (1050)(a repetition of (1034-4)): (1050)       Hmz.      Mingh nziaauc              aqv                   oc.

The fingx mbuox or surname La’Dangc in (164-2) is a contraction of Loz-Dangc (老鄧).
In a more formal self-introduction an Iu Mien would say Loz-Dangc Mienh ‘a person of
the Old Dang clan’. In (164-3) his domh mienh mbuox ‘adult name’ was asked.
Responding to the question, he gave his adult name Fux-Hin (164-4). So the full name
is Dangc Fux-Hin (鄧富興) (164-6). When giving one’s full name there is no need to
prefix Loz to the clan name, thus not like Loz-Dangc Fux-Hin (老鄧富興).
           Here we have two sets of polysyllabic combinations: Loz-Dangc and Dangc Fux-
Hin. A contrast between the presence and absence of tone sandhi in connecting
syllables tells us something about a linguistic status of units. Note there is no tone

The interjection with the high pitch level intonation found in Ls (181-3) and (181-11)
indicates that the speaker A is thinking, or trying to recall, not being able to make
sense out of the situation for a while. The second kind with the high rising intonation
in L (181-7) expresses that he has just understood what he was trying to figure out.
              Apart from the utterance-initial interjections, this example discourse
demonstrates a customary way of starting a conversation: (i) villager asking
whereabouts of a visitor (181-1), (ii) visitor replying (181-2), (iii) villager asking clan
name (181-3) and (iv) given name (181-5), (v) visitor replying (181-6), and (vi) both
sides proceeding to various topics. Mienh in (181-3) is asking a fingx ‘clan name’ and
this question has a different register Meih gueix fingx? [2SG be.honourable clan] ‘What
is your honourable clan?’, which will be shown in (196) in §5.4.3.1. The question
asking a given name, Mbuox fungc heuc? /buə˨˧ fuŋ˩ ↗heu˩/ [name how call] ‘(lit.)
How do you/I call your name?’ (181-5) seems to be replaced by a more casual question
Meih nyei mbuox heuc haiv.nyungc? /mei˧˩ ɲei˦ buə˨˧ heu˩ haʲ˦˥ ↗ɲuŋ˩/ [2SG POSS name
call what] ‘What is your name?’ (a variant of (195) in §5.4.3.1) among the Iu Mien.","[329, 330, 331, 332]"
"This is a good starting point to present our alternative view on the sacrosanct “SVO”
hypothesis as will be discussed in Chapter 4. It is true that the word order matters in
Iu Mien and it does show the ‘SVO’ order but the question is in what sense it does so.
It has already suggested that this issue is closely related to the “discourse-pragmatic
purposes”, which none of the eleven authors from China he depended on mention.
However, his pragmatic attitude of utilizing the term ‘subject’ and ‘object’ in a broad
sense is also helpful. We in the present study also heuristically make use of these terms
just as Sposato does for the sake of traditional view holders.
       With regard to the word order, however, our alternative view is based on
information structure following LaPolla (1993, 1995, 2003, 2006) for Chinese with
the assumption that Iu Mien is fundamentally a Topic-Focus language. An overview
of this stance will be explicated in Chapter 4.",[116]

12.7.2 Mirative Questions
           DeLancey (2001:377) argues an extended use of mirative can be found in
English as “attention noise”, “minimal positive response” “the polite response to being
told something, the sound of encouragement to a narrator, the sound that a listener
makes periodically as feedback to the speaker”. Japanese also has such corresponding
particles as /hɛː/ ‘Is that so?!’ or /hoː/ ‘Amazing!’ The following Iu Mien example is a
typical conversation encourager (856):

"      Summary of Chapter 14
       In this chapter different types of negative constructions have been
investigated, all of which contain the negative particle maiv or its shortened form mv.
Areas covered are (i) the simple negation, (ii) the modification of negation in
auxiliaries and emphatic negation, (iii) the negation of copular verbs, (iv) the double
negation both with the negative proposition and the affirmative proposition, (v) the
scope of negation in SVCs and coverb constructions, and (vi) the negative imperative,
i.e., prohibition, including negation of two different types of psycho-collocations.
       The investigation concentrated on the structural side and further study into
the semantics of negation is awaited.
       Since the negation of SVCs and coverb construction were considered in this
chapter, the topic of the multi-verb constructions (including SVCs and coverbs) should
get more attention, which will be in Chapter 15. Before that, we will briefly survey
the structures of questions in the next chapter.",[699]
"
5.4.3.1 Didactic nomination construction
        It should be pointed out that apart from the use as the verb of designation, the
verb heuc ‘to call’ is also used in various ways. Just to provide a background, examples
are drawn from Purnell (2012:244-5): (i) a loud utterance: e.g., heuc qiex hlo nyei
/heu˩ cʰiə˨˧ l ̥o˦ ɲei˦/ [call voice be.big ASST] ‘to call out loudly’, (ii) causative verb:
e.g., heuc ninh nzuonx biauv /heu˩ nin˧˩ dzuən˨˧ pʲau˦˥˧/ [call 3SG return house] ‘to call
on her/him to come back home’ [an alternative reading could be ‘to tell/order
her/him to go home’], and (iii) invocation (in religious ceremony): heuc mienv /heu˩
miən˦˥˧/ [call spirit] ‘to call on the spirits’, heuc lungh /heu˩ luŋ˧˩/ [call sky] ‘to call on
Heaven (the spirit world) for action of some type’.
        Now let us turn to the use of heuc as didactic nomination. In the construction
[NP1 heuc NP2], the equation relationship [NP1 = NP2] exists as in (194-1-3) ((194-3)
was quoted as (137) in §4.2.3.1): (194-1)    Yie     nyei    mbuox      heuc      Gueix-Zoih      oc.

             (ium_1998_01_TDK_DA_GueixZoih_MigHist;00.00.22-6)
The designation relationship or the equation relationship (as indicated by the symbol
“=”) is accidentally suggested by the fragmental utterance mbe~ [be] (atonal) in
(194-2). No such word exists in Iu Mien but this mbe~ well could be a mistaken
pronunciation of three possible forms: mbuox /buə˨˧/ ‘name’, the equative particle se
/se˦/ ‘that is’, and the copular verb benx /pen˨˧/ ‘to be’. All of these can fit the context
well. Thus, the designation verb heuc resembles German: Ich heiβe Geuix-Zoih, rather
than English: I am called Gueix-Zoih, using the passive participle.
         To ask a person’s name, heuc is followed by haaix.nyungc ‘what’ as in (195): (195)       Meih       nyei     Mienh mbuox                 heuc haiv.nyungc?
             เม่ย       เญย      เมี่ยน      บัว๋            เห่ ว   ไฮ้ .หญู่ง?

             (ium_1998_01_TDK_DA_GueixZoih_MigHist;00.00.32-3)
In an allegro speech haaix is reduced to haiv or even to /ha˥/ superimposed by the
high rising question intonation. Since (195) is a part of the continued conversation
from (194-1-3), he is asking the researcher’s Mien name. Among the Iu Mien themselves,
a customary question is Meih nyei mbuox heuc haiv.nyungc?135 [2SG POSS name call
what] ‘What is your name?’135
   However, there is a situation where an Iu Mien asks another Iu Mien’s Mien name. As large number
of Iu Mien drain into big cities, they speak in Central Thai using their Thai names that are on ID cards.
On encountering fellow Iu Mien, if young people do not shy away, they would ask “What is your Mien
name?”","[350, 351]"

reconstructed some important grammatical constructions. They include numerals
(both native and borrowed), personal pronouns (e.g. dual and inclusive/exclusive),
demonstratives, and classifiers. Development of grammatical constructions may also
be a result of language contact. Among the ample examples she presents, the following
instances of White Hmong also shed light on present-day Mien as in Table 5:Table 5. Chinese grammatical constructions borrowed into Iu Mien and White

       As will be evident in Chapter 5 onwards, Iu Mien grammar exhibits striking
similarity to Chinese. Ratliff delineates the typologically shared grammatical features
as follows:         […] in morphology, Hmong-Mien languages are characterized by the lack
         of inflectional morphology and the heavy use of compounds and
         reduplication. In syntax, Hmong-Mien language show SVO word order,
         paratactic rather than embedded structures (serial verb, serial noun, and
         serial sentence constructions), use of both a polar question particle and the
         A-not-A construction, Wh-question words in situ, adversative passives, and
         aspect markers rather than tense markers. Final discourse particles signal
         speaker attitude (Ratliff 2010:227-8).","[113, 114]"

case); and if this type of string occurs in succession without overt conjunctions
between them, they manifest as a multi-verb construction (an MVC), which may
include SVCs. The repertoires of aspectual verbs are also rich, e.g., baac ‘COMPLETIVE’,
liuz ‘PERFECTIVE’, ziangx ‘PERFECT’, nzengc ‘CONSUMPTIVE’, dorng ‘CESSATIVE’, and jienv
‘CONTINUOUS’ (all tentative analyses only). Differentiation between them will be
presented in §12.5.1. Secondly, different SFPs give sentences variety of nuances of
aspect. The example above can be further modified by an addition of SFP nyei as nyanc
jienv nyei [eat CONT ASST] ‘still eating’, in which nyei signifies ‘ASSERTIVE/AFFIRMATIVE’
aspect. Two more aspectual SFPs are aqv ‘new-situation aspect (NSIT)’(sometimes used
as INCHOATIVE) and mi’aqv ‘TELIC’. Thus, an Iu Mien sentence has two places to be
marked with respect to aspect: post-verbally with aspectual verbs and sentence-finally
with aspectual final particles.
       Modality.         According to Timberlake (2007:315) modality is defined:
“consideration of alternative realities mediated by an authority”. Alternative realities
include “necessity and possibility” (Lyons 1977:787-93), epistemic relation of
speakers to the world (i.e. directness vs. indirectness of the source of knowledge) (ibid.
793-809), and “obligation and permission” (ibid. 823-41).
       Modality in Iu Mien is expressed by verbs, an adverb, and SFPs. For example,
modal verbs includes daaix ‘it seems that…’ (epistemic modality), oix zuqc ‘must’
(deontic modality), and haiz ‘I hear’ (evidential modality), to name a few. One kind
of dynamic modality is expressed by adverb a’hneiv – V [be.willing V] (volitive).
Modality constructions which are involved with SFPs include quotative particle norh
‘they say’ (reported speech), mv bei [NEG know] ‘I wonder’ (speculative), and a
combination of a modal verb and an SFP duqv nyei [can STAT] ‘you may’ (permissive).
       There is another grammatical category of mirativity. This is marked by an
extended use of evidential modality in Iu Mien, i.e. the hearsay SFP norh used in the
2nd person (e.g. you dare say!?) and the 3rd person (e.g. he/she/they did [such a thing!]).
       Imperative (i.e. command), request, and optative (i.e. wishes) also come under
Timberlake’s term “alternative realities mediated by an authority” (2007:315).
Including these, a comprehensive treatment of modality will be found in Chapter 12.
       Mood.           The grammatical category involving such speech-act as
command, requests, entreaties, warnings, recommendations, and exhortations are
traditionally called mood (Lyons 1977:746ff). Mood also includes a change of
declarative statement to questions and negative statements.
Negation in Iu Mien is marked by the negative particle maiv / mai˦˥˧/or its contraction
form (i.e. syllabic nasal) mv /m̩ ˦˥˧/ ‘not’ placed immediately before the verbals (i.e.
verbs, copular verbs, modal verbs, and adjectival verbs). An example is ninh maiv daaih                                           620
[3sg neg come] ‘he doesn’t come’. More details including negation of imperative,
modals and double negation will be discussed in Chapter 13.","[655, 656, 657]"

4.3.4 Distinction between Core Arguments and Oblique
Arguments
       A distinction between core arguments and oblique arguments are made by (1)
Principle 2 and (2) a deletion diagnostic.
       First, Principle 2 is applied to diagnose that a core argument occurs in a focal
position at the very end of the sentence. Compare (156a), (156b) and (156c): (156a) Ninh [longc ndiangx(M)] gomv biauv(RS).
         นิ่น    [หล่ง    เดี๋ยง(M)]      ก๊ ม     เปย๊ า(RS).
         nin˧˩   loŋ˩     dʲaŋ˨˧          kom˦˥˧ pʲau˦˥˧
         3SG    use     tree/wood      build       house
         ‘He built a house with timber.’
According to the RMF in Principle 2, VP2 gomv biauv ‘to build a house’ of the SVC in
(156a) contains the core argument biauv.
       To prove that biauv is the core argument of the verb gomv ‘to build’, a deletion
diagnostic is applied to VP1 longc ndiangx ‘to use timber’ as in (156b), which is still
acceptable:                                             237
 (156b) Ninh gomv              biauv.
            นิ่น     ก๊ม       เปย๊า
            nin˧˩    kom˦˥˧    pʲau˦˥˧
            3SG build house
            ‘He built a house.’
As a corollary, (156b) indicates that VP1 in (156a) is a non-core or oblique
construction as the deletion of it does not affect the main message of the sentence.
          By contrast, a deletion of VP2 suggests that the predicate is incomplete as in
(156c): (156c) ?Ninh          longc      ndiangx.
             นิ่น      หล่ง       เดี๋ยง
             nin˧˩     loŋ˩       dʲaŋ˨˧
             3SG    use      tree/wood
             ‘He used timbers.’(156c) is only possible when it is uttered in response to a question Ninh longc
haaix.nyungc gomv biauv? [3SG use what build house] ‘What did he use to build a
house?’ To this question, even a deletion of an agent ninh ‘he’ is possible as in Longc
ndiangx [use wood] ‘With timbers’.
          Second, a deletion diagnostic shows what is treated as a core argument of a
verb. Compare (157a), (157b), and (157c): (157a) Lungh duih              mbiungc.
            ล่ง       ตุย้      บยูง่ .
            luŋ˧˩     tui˧˩     bʲuŋ˩
            sky       fall      rain
            ‘It’s raining.’ (lit. ‘The sky is letting rain drop down.’)
 (157b)      Ø       duih      mbiungc.
                     fall      rain
                     ‘It’s raining.’
 (157c) *lungh duih              Ø
         sky   fall
          The deletion of lungh ‘sky’ in (157b) does not affect a meaning of the sentence
in (157a) because lungh is a topic that is contextually and circumstantially retrievable.","[273, 274]"

                    Figure 37. Intonation in negative sentenceThis rule of keeping the lexical tone occurring sentence-finally is applicable to all
other tones also.
       When interrogative pronouns used as indefinite (non-specific) pronouns (i.e.
haaix ‘anywhere’, haaix dauh ‘whoever’ etc.) in a statement, they are pronounced in
their underlying tones. That is, here again as above, the sentence-final (St-final)
intonation corresponds with the tone of the St-final word. For instance, the sentence
meaning ‘We’re not going anywhere’ goes /iə˦ buə˦ mai˦˥˧ miŋ˧˩ haːi˨˧/ (Yie mbuo maiv
mingh haaix) [1 PL NEG go anywhere]. The sentence is not a question but a statement
though it contains /haːi˨˧/. Tone 5 /˨˧/ of the last word /haːi˨˧/ ‘anywhere’ and the
intonation of the whole sentence agree as demonstrated in Figure 38:
                                        184

Tone 1) [1 PL] ‘we’ (below 138Hz) keeping its shape as it is.","[219, 220, 221]"
"         Interrogative Constructions
          The most basic interrogative pronoun is haaix ‘what’ and this is combined with
other elements such as time, classifier, adverbs etc. to express all other kinds of
questions. The interrogative constructions are listed in Table 57.",[701]
"               Not only in counting things but also in referring to some referents the
classifiers are used in the phrase that has the same structure as mentioned above.
Internally, the classifier phrases occur in the following three constructions (where the
symbols ‘+’ and ‘±’ mean obligatory and optional):
               + CARDINAL NUMBER + CLF
               ± DEMONSTRATIVE        ± CLF       +NHD
               +Question Word         + CLF
A cardinal number is obligatory except for yietc /jet˩/ ‘one’, which is the only optional
number in the numeral classifier phrase (Court 1986:90). A classifier occurring after
demonstratives (wuov ‘that’, naaiv ‘this’, naaic ‘NEAR THE HEARER’) is sometimes
possible to be omitted. The question word haaix ‘which’ occurs in the third type of
classifier phrase in an interrogative sentence, e.g., haaix norm biauv? ‘Which house?’.
               Externally, the whole phrase functions like a noun in the positions of Topic or
Focus in a sentence.
               Below are presented examples of these three constructions. First, the basic
structure [+ CARDINAL NUMBER + CLF +NHD] is exemplified in (554)(repetition of (431-

         Third, the classifier phrase containing the question word haaix is illustrated as
in (557): (557)         haaix          joux              waac
               หาย            โจ๋ ว             หว่า

               (Purnell 2012:236)
         Finally, at the sentence level, the classifier phrases occur in two places, i.e.,
topical and focal positions. A numeral classifier phrase functions as a topic of a
sentence is exemplified in (558)(repetition of (141-2-3)): (558-1)       [Yietc         diuh       ga’maeqc               ndiangx]    naaic

The phrase inside the brackets [                 ] is marked by the topic marking demonstrative
naaic as the topic of the sentence and it is followed by the focus part predicating an
assertion in (558-2).
         In contrast to the topical function of the classifier phrase in a sentence
illustrated in (558-1-2), the classifier phrase norm hynangx-dauh ‘the year’ (from which
the numeral yietc ‘one’ is omitted) in (555) occurs in the predicate focus position after
the verb maaih ‘to have’ in the sentence.","[505, 506, 507]"

          One final example of the double SFP includes a question particle at the end of
a sentence as in aqv saah¿: the former is the NSIT, the latter a question particle
expecting an affirmative response, as illustrated in (1053): (1053)      Mienh             nzoih          aqv           saah¿

          A summary of the examples of double SFPs should be offered, given the term
is contradictory to the definition of “sentence-final”. That is to say, the aspect marking
particles ground the sentence, which is enough for the purpose of communicating
information. Then an addition of emotive particles at the very last position of the
sentence can further lubricate the interactional relationship between interlocutors.","[824, 825]"

11.4.1 Natural Happening in Post-Verbal Position
         Anything that falls from the sky is expressed in the post-verbal position (not
only rain!). The first example is from a well-known Iu Mien folktale Nda’maauh Jaauz
Nyei Gouv ‘A Story of a Wildcat’. In it when a man who is a main character lies down
under a tree waiting for a fruit to drop with his mouth open, a wildcat, instead of a
fruit, fell down from it (786): (786)     ndortv    norm     nda’maauh.jaauz
           ด๊ อด     นอม      ดะม่าว.จ์าว
           dɔt˥      nɔm˦     da maːu˧˩ caːu˨˧˩
           fall       CLF     wildcat
           ‘a wildcat fell down’
           (ium_20140403_04_SonyHDR-MV1_DA_BungzCunFouv_
           Nda'maauhJaauz;00.02.19-21)
The constituent order of this clause is V-NP, where NP comprises classifier and a noun.
A usual full NP with numeral classifier has three elements; especially when the
number is bigger than two, e.g., buo norm nda’maauh jaauz [three CLF wildcat] ‘three
wildcats’ but number one is often omitted.
         The next sequence from the same story contains three similar constructions in
one sentence including {blow}{wind} (787-1-2): (787-1)     Aengx   ndortv       norm,     borngz        nziaaux
             แอ๋ ง   ด๊ อด        นอม,      ป์ อง         หฑยาว

             again fall          GO        one    CLF
             so still one more (fruit) dropped (into his mouth).’

             Nda'maauhJaauz;00.02.06-29)
The third construction in this sentence has a structure VP-NP, where VP comprises V
and an aspectual verb mingh ‘GO’. The important point is that this does not show an
                                               602
order {drop}NP{GO}, but rather, the actual order as appears in the speech has the NP
at very end of the clause.
         More typical meteorological phenomena are exemplified both in affirmative
and in negative constructions, the NPs are in the square brackets in the post-verbal
position. See (788-1-2) for an affirmative: (788-1)     Dong      bung              maengx         faaux              [dorv               mbuonx],

           The reading of (855b-1-2) would be “How come you could say ‘Wow, that

connocation Meih maiv horpc zuqc gorngv [2SG NEG right TOUCH say] ‘You shouldn’t say

           It is interesting to note the tone of norh /nɔ˧˩/ is identical with the falling
question intonation /¿/ (Bloomfield 1933:92, 114-5, 171. See also “Conventions Used
in Text Transcription”). Furthermore, it is also interesting to note DeLancey’s terms
“mirative intonation contour” (2001:377) for Hare and English corresponds that of
norh /nɔ˧˩/ in Iu Mien. Let us orthographically mark it with ‘¡’, though it is not
conventional among the users of the Unified Script.","[679, 680]"

       Thus, the structure of the co-occurrence of the sentence final grounding
elements, or the ordering of double SFPs, can be summarised as follows:
                                 Co-occurrence of grounding elements
                                                             modal particle

                                                             question particle
       There are some other SFPs. The following list only offers items without
examples:
   saa /saː˦/ ‘indicates the speaker’s irritation or indignation’ (Purnell 2012:649)   lorqv /lɔʔ˥/ ‘a particle throwing back onto the speaker whatever positive or
                negative comments were made about one’s character or ability’ (ibid.
                390)   weqv or wev /weʔ˥/ or /we˦˥/ ‘indicates a speaker’s emphatic shifting of
              responsibility for a remark or assumption back to the previous speaker’
              (ibid. 717)
       Summary of Chapter 19
       An isolated word or an abstract sentence does not communicate. It needs to be
grounded in the interlocutory scene. To achieve this SFPs are lavishly used. As the
grounding elements, SFPs function as both aspectual markers and modal markers.
       By way of summary, Principle 6 is reiterated:         Principle 6. Sentence final particles (SFPs) semantically and pragmatically
         play multiple roles, and function as grounding elements though optional
         (§4.2.1).","[825, 826]"

          Indefinite Pronouns (Non-specific Pronouns)
           Indefinite pronouns or non-specific pronouns are not interrogative pronouns
though their forms are the same in Iu Mien, e.g. haaix.dauh ‘whoever’ and ‘who?’ or
haaix.zanc ‘whenever’ and ‘when?’ By the use of indefinite pronouns the speaker is
not asking a question but making a statement. A sentence containing an indefinite
pronoun is uttered with the statement intonation, not the question intonation.
Interrogative pronouns will be delineated in §14.3.
           See an example of the indefinite pronoun of persons haaix.dauh ‘whoever’ in

           (A Story of Faam-Bae and Aeng-Doi, Arisawa (2006:233))         Heavily Modified Noun Phrases
         The recursion of subordinate-cum-possessive particle (SBCP) nyei briefly
mentioned in §4.2.3.4 is the principle that allows heavy modifications of noun
phrases. The SBCP nyei possesses the versatility in both connecting (as a possessive
particle, POSS) the preceding noun and connecting (as a relativiser, REL) the clause to
the following head noun.164 Thus, both
         (a) yie nyei biauv /iə˦ ɲei˦ pʲau˦˥˧/
             [1SG POSS house]
             ‘my house’
         and
         (b) yie gomv daaih nyei biauv /iə˦ gom˦˥˧ taːi˧˩ ɲei˦ pʲau˦˥˧/
             [1SG build COME REL house]
             ‘the house which I have built’
are possible. When the recursion of nyei is allied with the relative constructions (i.e.
both nyei-relative and dongh-relative constructions), it is possible to form a highly
complicated NP.
         Here again it is noted that the distinction between the noun phrases and the
nouns modified by a relative clause depends on analysist’s interpretation, just as in
the relationship between compound nouns and noun phrases (cf. §8.2 and
         Table 39). It is feasible to take (b) as a long noun phrase as much as taking (a)
as it is. Given the freedom of constructing a clause as long as a speaker wants until164
   These functions are only two of the four that the particle can perform. The others are the adverbialiser

        The presentative construction starts a narrative by introducing a new
participant into a discourse. It can occur at the very beginning of a story or in the
middle of a narrative in order to introduce a new (additional) participant. It has a
structure [maaih + NP] as in (783):

         In the previous section we have seen the entity-central presentative verb
maaih, in which the NP follows the verb. In the following example which shows the
same word order V-NP, it is an event that is presented. Thus, in contrast to the one in
the previous section, the construction in this section can be referred to as event-central
presentative word order or event-central presentative construction as discussed in
LaPolla and Poa (2006:9).
         Observe that the order is V-NP; and the verb yungz in (784-1) is a transitive
verb, but the verb daic in (784-2), an intransitive verb: (784-1)    Yietc    buon              yungz       [buo    dauh],

         This V-NP event-central presentative construction occurs also in a question as
in (785):

         It is true that (784-1) can be analysed as topic-focus order. However, see the
analysis of a similar Chinese clause by LaPolla and Poa (2006), (22b.4) qī suì shí sǐ-le
fùqīn [seven years.old time die-ASP father] ‘when he was seven his father died’ (ibid.
278) as follows:          The clause form in (22b.4) involves two parts, a topic and a comment [i.e.
          focus]. What seems to make this clause unusual is that the comment [i.e.
          focus] takes the form of an event-central presentative clause. Event-central
          presentative clauses assert the existence (happening) of an event. These
          clause do not have a two-part topic-comment [i.e. topic-focus] structure;
          they are thetic rather than categorical (LaPolla and Poa 2006:279).","[634, 635, 636]"

       Evidentiality and Mirativity
       The SFP norh marks that the sentence is a reported one. It is used to quote a
speech by the 3rd person, the 2nd person and the 1st person or self-reporting. But when
quoting the 2nd person, it yields mirativity.
       A question may be raised how mirativity presented in the following two
sections differs to ordinary rhetorical questions. The former encodes surprise while
the latter expresses other illocutionary forces such as command, statement, or
evaluation. Friedman (1986) defines “admirative” (his term for mirative) as follows:         Although the admirative is traditionally defined as a mood expressing
         surprise, it is also used to express irony, doubt, reportedness, etc. In all its
         uses the admirative somehow refers to the speaker’s present or past
         nonconfirmation of the truth of the statement. This is obvious when the
         admirative is used to express irony or doubt […], but it is also the case when
         the admirative is used for surprise […] or reported speech […]. […] It
         should be noted that surprise is not to be limited to expressions of strong
         amazement. Any expressive relation of the speaker to the speech event in
         which there is some nuance of the unexpected can be included in this use of
         surprise (Friedman 1986:180-1).","[677, 678, 679]"

prepositioned or postpositioned in relation to the main clause, they are termed as pre-
pendent clauses and post-pendent clauses.
          The hypotaxis in Iu Mien is classified into the following six patters:
    1) Pre-pendent clauses that are marked clause-initially
    2) Pre-pendent clauses that are marked clause-finally
    3) Pre-pendent clauses that are marked clause-medially
    4) Pre-pendent clauses that are marked both clause-initially and clause-finally
    5) Post-pendent clauses that are marked clause-initially
    6) Post-pendent clauses that are marked both clause-initially and clause-finally
          The following ten subordinate clauses are grouped under the six types:
   Pre-pendent clauses that are marked clause-initially
    (i)    Cause clause laaix-CL [due.to CL] ‘due to the fact that CL’
    (ii) Concessive clause maiv.gunv-CL [NEG.control CL] ‘although CL’
   Pre-pendent clauses that are marked clause-finally
    (iii) Temporal clause CL-nyei.ziangh.hoc [REL time sign CL] ‘at the time when CL’
    (iv) Temporal clause CL-wuov.zanc [CL DEM.time] ‘when CL’
   Pre-pendent clauses that are marked clause-medially
    (v)    Temporal clause yietv-CL [once CL] ‘as soon as CL’
    (vi) Temporal clause [V-gau]CL [V and.then] ‘CL and then’
   Pre-pendent clause that are marked both clause-initially and clause-finally
    (vii) Conditional clause se.gorngv-CL-nor [if CL as] ‘if CL’
   Post-pendent clauses that are marked clause-initially
    (viii) Purpose clause weic-CL [for CL] ‘in order that CL’
    (ix) Reason clause weic.zuqc-CL [for.TOUCHADVERSATIVE] ‘because CL’
   Post-pendent clauses that are marked both clause-initially and clause-finally
    (x)    Simile clause hnangv-CL-wuov.nor [like CL DEM.as] ‘as if CL’ or ‘just like CL’
          The temporal subordinate clause (iv) needs more elaboration than other
constructions. Just briefly, the wuov.zanc-construction in (iv) has more frequency to                                            745
occur at the beginning of the main clause rather than the above-mentioned type of
“clause-final” marking. Its delineation will be given in due course.
        These variations are also found in other constructions of the ten types with
regard to the order of subordinate-main clauses. It is important to note that the above-
listed classification is based on frequency, in other words, common occurrences of
these constructions. Li and Thompson (1989:632-3) in discussing clause linking in
Chinese say that the use of “forward linking” elements (our pre-pendent clause
markers) verses non-use varies “because of the speaker’s intention”. Similarly, Iu Mien
speakers may link clauses without using the markers and may also alter the order of
a subordinate clause and a main clause. However, there should be reason for such
alternation. It is, in fact, crucially important to note that the order {main clause} –
{subordinate clause} goes against the overall principle of the “right-ward multilayered
focus” (RMF) (the second principle presented in §4.2.1). That is, Why the subordinate
clauses occurs in the position of focus? Why three types of clauses, i.e., purpose clause,
reason clause, and simile clause, occur sentence-finally contrary to the principle of the
right-ward focus structure? We would like to provide an answer to the question
differently than “because of the speaker’s intention”. It will be discussed in terms of
iconicity of event perception in §§18.3.5–6.
        One more remark should be appropriate before we start investigating
individual constructions. It should be noted that Iu Mien exhibits a relative freedom
in use of “redundant” conjunctions. An example is given here by comparing Iu Mien
and English. In English, as long as a subordinate clause is marked by a conjunction, a
main clause needs no marking, e.g., Alhough he was sick, he got out of bed to help our
moving. In Iu Mien, by contrast, it is possible to have markers on both clauses, e.g.,
{although he was sick}, {but he got out of bed to help our moving}. In this case too,
it is known to native speakers that the clause {although he was sick} is subordinate
because it cannot stop just that; the listener would wait till it is completed by a supply
of the main clause.","[780, 781, 782]"

The term gorx-youz ‘elder brother and younger brother’ with the hyphen indicating
the tone-sandhi is a compound cover term for gorx and youz. In the above context the
term is generic and refers to any Iu Mien persons from different clans or villages.
However, once the two interlocutors have found a few clues that they have common
relatives (cien-ceqv in (181-5)), they switch to particular kinship terms that specify the
relationship in addressing each other.
         The clues come from asking baan-buic ‘cycle of generation names’ as in (183-1-
11
  ):
129
   The particle nor ‘as’ in the first occurrence here corresponds to hnangv ‘like’: hnangv … nor [like …
as] ‘like/as…’. Thus hnangv mv maaih nor [like NEG have as] translates ‘as an example, you don’t have
(the same name as your visitor found in your relatives)’. In contrast, the second nor is a topic marker,
corresponding to se.gorngv ‘if’ at the beginning of the clause: Se.gorngv … nor aeqv [if … TOP PDP] ‘if
… is the case’. The construction se.gorngv … nor itself constitutes a subordinate clause but the pending
particle aeqv further marks clearly the end of it and the beginning of the main clause that starts after it.","[333, 334]"

2.3.1.11 Pedagogical grammars
       By pedagogical grammars in this section are meant language lessons for non-
native speakers to learn Iu Mien. The earliest is Hellen Cox’s (1960) A Preliminary
                                               80
Guide to the Study of the Yao Language, and the second edition was issued in 1967 as
Yao Language Course. The revision was made for refinement in the areas of tone sandhi
and the interpretation of question intonation based on Purnell’s (1965) Phonology of
a Yao Dialect Spoken in the Province of Chiangrai. In the same line of tradition, Burgess
(1996) produced updated user-friendly Mien Language Course in three orthographies
(i.e. “Old Roman”, “New Roman (Unified)”, and Thai-based Mien Script; cf. §1.6, the
details will be discussed in §3.4) based on the works by Cox (1960, 1967). These three
materials are all packed with numerous contrast drills in eight tones, tone sandhi,
rising and falling question intonations, and practice in grammatical patterns and
colloquial expressions supported by audio tape lessons.
         Pán (1988), as mentioned in §2.3.1.3, is a Yao primer, providing lessons to
teach basic vocabulary in a Roman-based orthography (cf. §2.3.3 and §3.4.1) and
common conversational phrases and sentences. Though it does not give lessons on
grammatical items explicitly, the progressively arranged sentence practice will bring
the students to a level of reading longer passages such as Mienh Nyei55 Fingx [Iu.Mien
SBCP clan] ‘The Clans of the (Iu) Mien’, Bienhgouv56 Zeix Tinhdeic57 [Bien.old createheaven.earth] ‘Old Bien created the heaven and earth’, and others.
         Court (1991), published from Lonely Planet edited by Bradley, provides
backpackers and researchers who would visit Iu Mien villages in northern Thailand.
It contains pronunciation guides, basic useful phrases and sentences preceded by
introductory information such as historical and cultural background of the people.
The orthography used therein is “New Roman Script” or “Unified Script” (§3.4.1.1)
but exhibits some sort of transitional fluctuation (similar to the writing system
adopted in Pán (1988)). That is, a shift and residue of his use of the older version of
“Roman Script” in his 1986 grammar to an intermediate stage of unification in Court
(1991) with the intention of targeting more international audience is noticeable. For
example, the voiced initial stops /b, d, g/ are still written as b, d, g, which should be
mb, nd, nq in the Unified Script (i.e. “New Roman Script”). More standardised stage
of the orthography (e.g. a refined use of hyphen as an indicator of tone sandhi) came
to be available in Purnell (2012).
         Chop-Kacha’anant ([1980], 2523 BE) former researcher at the Tribal Research
Institute, the Tribal Welfare Division, the Public Welfare Department of Thai
government at Chiang Mai University, was primarily written for the government55
    The Subordinate-cum-Possessive Particle (SBCP) is spelled in the Unified Script (§3.4.1) nyei.
56
    The Iu Mien’s progenitor Bienhgouv (盘(盤)古) used in this primer is a variation of Bienh Hungh
discussed in §2.2.2.1. In the Unified Script Bienhgouv is spelled separately Bienh Gouv.
57
    Tinhdeic [heaven earth] is spelled in the Unified Script Tin-deic, preserving the underlying level tone
/˧˩/ of tin but indicating tone sandhi by a hyphen ‘-’. In tinhdeic in Pán’s (1988) primer, the result tone of
tone sandhi is indicated phonetically by ‘-h’ after tin, connected to deic ‘earth’.","[116, 117]"
"        The Semantic Head and Its Surroundings
          This section discusses how nouns that express the main meaning are combined
with various kinds of modifiers in forming noun phrases. Such nouns within NPs are
called nominal heads as well as semantic heads as opposed to syntactic heads. 151
According to Payne (2006:95) “the word that expresses the main meaning of the
clump is referred to as the SEMANTIC HEAD”. With regard to the directions of
modification in relation to the semantic head, both orders [modifier-NHD] (i.e.
premodification or left-branching) and [NHD-modifier] (i.e. postmodification or right-
branching) are found in Iu Mien.
          Though there has been a theory that Chinese is a headless language in terms
of the modifier-modified relationship primarily based on statistics (Huang 1998:261-
83, Packer 2000), as far as Iu Mien is concerned it has a head despite its long history
of contact with Chinese. In fact, it is through this contact that Iu Mien exhibits the
two-way modification directions, either a modifier preceding a head noun or a head
noun followed by a modifier (cf. Court 1986:128). See the following example (524-1-
2
 ) asking two questions about it: (a) “What kind of tree is it?” and (b) “What kind of
fruit is it?” with regard to the N1-N2 sequence biouv-ndiangx [fruit tree]:    (524-1)   Buatc             biouv     ziouc     hiuv          duqv

For the reason of familiarity, all of Chapter 5 is dedicated to the study of Iu Mien
names because everyone has names. This chapter will help Iu Mien see that their
names have grammar.
       Chapter 3 presents the phonological summary of the language including the
orthographies. Chapter 4 sets out seven working principles of the grammar, one of
which establishes the rightward multi-layered focus structure, i.e., the more rightward
(toward the end of a sentence) a constituent goes, the more focus it gets. The chapter
also previews grammatical categories or “parts-of-speech”. Chapter 5 is a bridge from
the morphology and word formation found in the study of Iu Mien names (i.e.
onomastics) to the study of compounds, noun phrases, and syntax.
       Chapter 6 considers the nominal, verbal, and adjectival compounds, including
psycho-collocations. Chapter 7 distinguishes Chinese-loan adjectives and the
adjectival verbs of Iu Mien origin, and focuses on the verbal nature of the latter.
Chapter 8 is on the noun phrases, including a comprehensive list of the sortal and
measure numerical classifiers and three types of relative clauses.
       Chapter 9 discusses the adverbial constructions, which readily utilize the
aspectual verb jienv /cʲen˦˥˨/ ‘to continue’ and the adverbialising particle nyei /ɲei˦/.
Chapter 10 argues that the copula construction is a linkage between the topic and the
focus predicate. Chapter 11 is on the verbs and argument structure, which includes
topics regarding the ditransitive constructions, the presentative constructions, and
four cases of a seemingly post-verbal subject.
       Chapter 12 gives an overview of auxiliaries, aspectual verbs and particles, and
modality including evidentials. Chapter 13 analyses the negative constructions, and
Chapter 14 presents the question constructions.
       Chapter 15 argues the multi-verb constructions in terms of mono-clausal and
multi-clausal MVCs. The former includes the serial verb constructions (SVCs), the
semantic role coverb phrases. It also addresses the similarity between the semantic
role coverb phrases and prepositions, the latter being rare but grammaticalisation
seems to be underway in the language.
       Chapter 16 and Chapter 17 are considered with reference to the egocentric
viewing arrangement (in terms of Cognitive Grammar) in relation to environment,
events and state of affairs that surround the speaker. Chapter 16 analyses the spatial
constructions, and Chapter 17 argues that the verbs duqv /tuʔ˥/ ‘to get’ and zuqc
/t͡suʔ˩/ ‘to touch’ are in contrast in the sense that the former relates the speaker with
the world favourably, while the latter does adversively.","[54, 55]"
