7.5 QUESTIONS
7.5.1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
   Yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence,
but are said with a rising, questioning intonation:
  (7-137) Gajbi murnd-u          yana         manganyma?
          eat   IDU.INC.A-FUT this.IV.SG.ACC tucker.Ili(ACC)
          Can we eat some of this food?
   (7-138) Yagu ny-a         nagatna            ngayijinya ngangirna?
           leave 2SG.A-PST that.one.1I.SG.ACC FM.II(ACC) 2SG.POSS.II(ACC)
           Did you drop your grandmother off (at the hospital)?
   (7-139) Yana                ngarrga?
             this.IV.SG:NOM ISG.POSS.IV(NOM)
             Is this mine?
  Hale's corpus contains examples in which an interrogative particle gayi is used in such
polar yes/no questions. Note that this particle appears in the auxiliary in examples (7-140)
and (7-141), and alone in second position in the verbless clause (7-142):18
   (7-140) Duditiarri gayi-ny-u     iniyawulu?
           spear      INT-2SG.A-FUT that.I.DU.ACC
             What, you are spearing them (du)? (Hale 1959:13)
18 In the following examples I have used the orthography and glossing conventions of this work, hut have
     retained Hale's translations.
198     Chapter 7   (7-141) Balijî  gayi-nyi?
           hungry INT-2SG.S(PR)
           Are you hungry? (Hale 1959:19)
   (7-142) Gudayi-barli                gayi inîya                 janji?
              bite-AGNT.I(NOM) INT that.I.SG.NOM dog.I(NOM)
              Is that dog cheeky? (Hale 1959:29)
   This interrogative particle is not present in my corpus and, since the dialect that Hale
recorded appears to be closer to Gudanji than Wambaya,19 it is possible that the interrogative
particle gayi is present only in Gudanji. However, there is a negative interrogative particle in '
Wambaya present in both my corpus and Hale's notes, and also reported by Chadwick
(1978:99). The form of this particle is wayi and, like the negative particle guyala, it requires
the presence of irrealis marking in the auxiliary. There is some variability as to how sentences
containing this particle are translated into English: either as negative yes/no questions
(examples (7-143), (7-144)); information questions meaning `why not' (7-143); or as simple
positive yes/no questions ((7-145), (7-146)):
   (7-143) Wayî           ny-uda                îlînga?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PST hear
              Aren't you listening?/Why aren't you listening?
   (7-144) Wayi           ny-uda                yabu balanucrru?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PST have                 spear.IV(ACC)
              Don't you have a spear? (Hale 1959:31)
   (7-145) Wayî           ny-udi              ngarlwî Wambaya?
              NEG.INT 2SG.S-NACT.PR talk
              Can you talk Wambaya? (Hale 1959:31)
   (7-146) (W)ayî ny-udî               yabu guyiga?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PR    have fire.IV(ACC)
              Have you got firewood? (Chadwick 1978:99)
   I suspect that the basic use of wayî is in yes/no questions when the speaker is anticipating
a negative reply, and that examples such as (7-145) and (7-146) could probably have been
explained in this way in the contexts in which they were given. The information question
associated with (7-143) could arise for pragmatic reasons: if the speaker asks the question
Aren't you listening? then it might be expected that he/she is also looking for an explanation
why. However, further research is required in order to test this hypothesis and more
accurately determine the meaning of this particle and the contexts of its use.","[215, 216]"

                                            PREFACE
   Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language originally spoken in the Barkly Tablelands
region of the Northern Territory, Australia. There are perhaps 8-10 fluent speakers
remaining, most of whom live in Tennant Creek and Elliott in the Northern Territory. The
linguistic work which led to this volume was initiated by the Wambaya community (through
the Gurungu Council Aboriginal Corporation in Elliott) out of an increasing concern for the
fate of their language as these few remaining speakers get older. It is hoped that this
(ongoing) work will help younger Wambaya speakers learn something of their language
now, and have some access to their language even when it is no longer being spoken around
them.
   While the main focus of this work has been on Wambaya, substantial reference has also
been made throughout the text to the mutually intelligible dialect Gudanji. The close and long-
term interaction between the Wambaya and Gudanji communities makes it virtually
impossible to work on one dialect without working on the other. Furthermore, the similarly
small number of remaining Gudanji speakers makes any work on this dialect equally urgent.
   The research for this grammar was conducted during six field trips, totalling over seven
months, from February 1991 to August 1994. Work was begun in Elliott, N.T., and then, as
many Elliott Wambaya moved to Tennant Creek, was continued there. There was a lot of
support for the project from the Wambaya/Gudanji people of both Elliott and Tennant Creek.
Although people were not always able to to help me with language material, help came in
many different forms: from helping with the elicitation and transcription of stories, to
providing access to computers and office space, to providing company for the many hours
spent driving between Elliott and Tennant Creek.
   This grammar is a revised version of my Melbourne University MA thesis (Nordlinger
1993a). The revisions include the reanalysis of some earlier analyses (e.g. the treatment of
complex clauses in Chapter 8), and the inclusion of new data collected since the MA thesis
was submitted (e.g. the causal suffix in §4.4.9). Unfortunately, the constraints of time have
made it impossible to cover all areas of Wambaya grammar in the same amount of detail.
Wambaya is a morphologically complex language, and thus these aspects of the grammar
have been given the most attention (Chapters 4-6); other areas have been given less coverage
than they deserve (e.g. complex sentences); and still others have been left out altogether (e.g.
prosody, discourse). Throughout the text I have indicated areas in which more work is
needed in the hope that it can be carried out in the future.
   This grammar is written as a reference grammar. I have therefore deliberately avoided
presenting the data in any particular theoretical framework, or devoting much discussion to
the interesting issues raised by aspects of Wambaya grammar for current theoretical research.
Instead I have tried to describe this interesting language in its own terms, using a substantial
number of naturally occurring examples and texts. My belief is that this will give the
grammatical description the best chance of standing the test of time, and readers the best
chance of discovering things in the language that I have not, perhaps even inspiring more
work on Wambaya before it is too late.                                               xi

7.5.2 INFORMATION QUESTIONS
   These questions involve the use of an indefinite/interrogative, usually initial in the clause,
that indicates the nature of the information being sought. As in many Australian languages,
indefinite/interrogatives in Wambaya can be used either in interrogative function (e.g. `who',
`what') or as indefinite pronouns (e.g. `someone', `something'). They contain one of five
basic roots: gayinî- `what, who'; inja- `where, which'; yangula `when'; yangulanji `how19 Based on the forms of the auxiliaries and the negative particles he recorded, as well as some of the lexical
    items.

marking in order to cover such meanings as `who, what, with what, for what' and `which,
where to, where from' respectively. Some examples of the interrogative uses of these forms
follow; indefinitermterrogatives are discussed in more detail in §4.7.

17 I have no examples of these predicates in non-finite subordinate clauses, and so do not know whether the
     modifying verb would remain in the non-future form there as well.
     It is also possible that ganjimi `all' and gurinymi `well, properly' are simply separate lexemes, although
      homophonous with and derived from the verbs ganjimi `finish' and gurinymi `make good' respectively.
      Under this analysis, constructions as in (7-116) and (7-117) above are not complex predicates but simply
      contain a verb and a modifying adverb.
                                                                 Syntax of simple sentences   195   (7-121) Durra          gî-n,             ngirra îrr-agba jananmi narunguja.

    These examples appear to have the intonational contour of single clauses and thus, are not
analysable as coordinate clauses along the lines of those discussed in §8.2.2. However, at
this stage of the investigation, such a distinction is based on purely impressionistic grounds
and needs to be confirmed by structural and semantic evidence that these examples contain a
single clause while those in §8.2.2 do not. For example, future tense examples are needed in
order to find out which verb (if not both) is inflected with the verbal future tense suffix. If
only one verb can be inflected, this would be strong evidence that the two belong to a single
clause; conversely if both verbs are inflected, this may suggest that they are in separate
clauses. Further research is also needed into the semantics of these constructions. For
example, if it is discovered that there a re semantic restrictions on the verbs which can appear
in these constructions, this may be evidence that there is only one clause involved, since we
would be less likely to expect co-occurrence restrictions to exist across clause boundaries.
Furthermore, if these constructions do involve only a single clause, it remains to be
determined what the semantic difference is between these clauses and coordinate clauses,
such as the following.

2.2.3.1 INTRAMORPHEMIC CLUSTERS
   Word-medial clusters of two consonants a re common in Wambaya. The biconsonantal
clusters that are found in the corpus are shown in Table 2.3. The initial consonant of the
cluster is shown along the vert ical axis, and the second consonant is given along the
horizontal axis. The consonan ts are given in the same order as Hamilton's continuum: labials,
dorsals, laminais and apicals (alveolars and then retroflexes). Within each group the
consonants are given in the order: stop, nasal, liquid, semivowel. Question marks indicate
what may be accidental gaps in the table.",[47]

              She'll see her brother.
   Note that the use of -liji is not obligatory. Thus, example (4-216) could also be expressed
as a simple possessive construction:
38  It can presumably occur with feminine nouns too (the expected form would he -linea), hut there are no
    examples in the corpus.
39 Note that it is only a question of explicitness:. it is quite possible to have this meaning without the use
    of -liji. _
40 The auxiliary in this sentence has been ellipsed.

               She'll see her brother.
    In fact it is not always the case that -liji emphasises the subject as possessor (although this
is its usual function). In one example -liji marks a kinship term as belonging to the discourse
topic of the clause.41 In example (4-218) the kin term gulu-liji is not governed by the subject
of its clause (which is `I'), but is governed by the `she' that had been discussed in the
previous two clauses and is clearly the topic of the discourse.

4.6.3 GA SERIES
   There is another set of Wambaya forms which complicate the system of demonstratives
discussed above: sometimes these forms seem to act like demonstratives, but at other times
appear to be more like nouns. When behaving like demonstratives, these ga forms54 occur in
place of the remote forms. The use of these forms is so common that Chadwick (1978) gives
the dual and plural forms as the only remote dual and plural Class I and II demonstratives in
Wambaya. These forms are as follows:55
      Class I NOM/ACC SG   igima
                        DU iguwulu
                        PL igigunjî
                LOC SG 56
                        DU iguwuliji
                        PL igigunyini
      Class it NOM/ACC SG  nagarna
                        DU nagawulu
                       PL  nagagunya
                LOC    SG  —
                       DU nagawuliji
                       PL  nagagunyani
      Class Iv NOM/ACC SG  yagama
                       DU yagawulu
                       PL  yagagunja
   In form, these appear to be demonstratives: all forms contain the appropriate gender prefix:
i (I), na- (Il) and ya- (Iv); and the plural suffix that is used (-gunji/-gunya) is that which occurs
with demonstratives, not with nouns (see §4.3 for a discussion of number marking on
nouns). However, igima and nagarna, which are extremely common, are translated by
speakers as meaning `boy' and `girl' respectively and often seem to be functioning more like
nouns than demonstratives. Consider the examples below.
In examples (4-242) and (4-243) it is not clear whether the forms in question are functioning
as nouns or as demonstratives. However, particularly in (4-242) — the opening line of Text 6,
in which there is modification by adjectives — they seem to be rather noun-like in function.",[135]
"
4.5 DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY
4.5.1 NOMINAL-TO-NOMINAL MORPHOLOGY
4.5.1.1 -JARRA/-YARRA `NEXT, ANOTHER'
   This suffix is found with only four words in the corpus. Three of them are time nominals
with which the suffix expresses the meaning `next'. The other is the noun maga `camp,
country' (Iv) with which the suffix expresses the meaning `another'. There does not appear to
be any phonological conditioning as to the form of the suffix. The allomorph with the initial
stop occurs with maga `camp, country' and that with the initial glide is found with the time
nominals.37
      bulinama        tomorrow          >    bulîna-yarra           day after tomorrow
      ngijininima     tomorrow          >    ngijînî-yarra          day after tomorrow
      garnumba        wet season        >    garnumba-yarra         next wet season
      maga            camp              >    maga-jarra             another place
37 This suffix may be related to the Kayardild suffix -varrad- `another' (Evans 1995a).
                                                                                          Nominals      1034.5.1.2 REFLEXIVE-POSSESSIVE SUFFIX
   The form of this suffix is -liji and it is found only with masculine kinship nouns.38 The
function of this suffix, although not yet fully understood, is apparently to explicitly mark the
fact that the `possessor' of the kin is the subject (as opposed to the speaker, for example).39
Thus, there is an alternation among some kinship terms in the corpus between plain forms, as
given in §123.2, and forms suffixed with -liji. For example:
     (4-211) Ngajbî gin-a          ganggu     yarru-warda.
             see    3SG.M.A-PST FF.I(ACC) go-INF
             He saw grandfather walking (along).
     (4-212) Ngajbî gin-a           ganggu-liji         yarru-warda.
             see     3SG.M.A-PST    FF.I-REFL.POSS(ACC) go-INF
             He saw his grandfather walking (along).
   A sentence such as (4-211) is potentially ambiguous as to whose ganggu is in question:
the subject's or the speaker's (as in `He saw (my) Grandfather walking along'). In example
(4-212), however, the meaning can only be that the subject saw his own ganggu. Thus, -liji
appears to be a reflexive possessive marker, indicating that the possessor of the kin is the
subject Other examples include:
     (4-213) Garnguji          juwa            irri        gulug-ba. Gabi irr-a
              many_I(NOM) man.I(NOM) 3PL.S(NP) sleep-FUT NEG 3PL.S-PST

              They sleep with many men. They don't have any shame. (They) sleep with their
              cousins, their great-uncles, their cousins.
     Importantly, the antecedent for -liji must be third person:
     (4-214) *Ngaj-ba ny-u                baba-liji.
                see-FUT 2SG.A-FUT brother.I-REFL.POSS(ACC)
              You'll see your brother.
     (4-215) *Ngaj-ba ng-u                baba-liji.

              I'll see my brother.","[120, 121]"

   My greatest debt is to the Wambaya people who welcomed me into their community and
taught me, so patiently, what I know of their language. In particular I would like to thank my
friends and language teachers, Molly Nurlanyma Grueman, Minnie Niyamarrama Nimara,
Mavis Bangarinya Hogan and Powder Bangarinji O'Keefe (Gudanji) for their never-ending
cooperation, tolerance and patience. They cheerfully shared with me their language and their
stories, answered my questions, and corrected my mistakes. For their support and friendship
I would also like to thank many other people from Elliott and Tennant Creek, including:
Florine Bathern, Ivy Duncan, Amy and Jeffrey Dixon, Billy Hayes, Sandra Hogan, Judy
Holt, Ian Hopwood, Michael Neade, Penny Watson, Heather Wilson and Oscar Wilson; all
of the people who participated in the Wambaya literacy workshop in Tennant Creek in April
1993; and, especially, Moana Strauss for generously sharing her flat and car during my
months of fieldwork. The Gurungu Council in Elliott, who initiated this project, helped
enormously in obtaining funding for my visits and was always cooperative, as was the
Papulu Apparr-kari language centre in Tennant Creek.
   A very special thanks goes to. Nick Evans, who was a dedicated and enthusiastic MA
supervisor, and who first got me interested in working on Australian languages. Without his
invaluable advice, support and encouragement this project might never have got off the
ground. Robert Hoogenraad provided general encouragement and help in the field and I was
also fortunate enough to spend some time in the field with Luise Hercus, David Nash and
Gavan Breen, whose kind support and advice were most appreciated. Many thanks are due
also to John Henderson and Robert Hoogenraad, who provided much-needed computer
assistance. For insightful comments on various aspects of this grammar I am indebted to
Peter Austin, Juliette Blevins, Joan Bresnan, Margaret Carew, Ian Green, John Hajek and
Lesley Stirling. In particular, my revisions to this grammar have benefited enormously from
the comments and suggestions of my two MA examiners, Bill McGregor and Jane Simpson.
Of course, none of these people can be held responsible for any of the remaining flaws or
inadequacies.
   This project would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian
Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies grant L91/4100, and the Australian
Research Council grant A58930745 (awarded to Nick Evans) entitled 'Non-Pama-Nyungan
languages of Northern Australia: descriptive, grammatical, comparative and sociolinguistic
investigations'. Funding for an additional field trip in 1994 was provided by the Centre for
the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University, with the help of Peter Sells
and Stanley Peters. I thank all these people and organisations for their generous support.
   My heartfelt thanks go to Dean Robinson, who stood by me throughout this project and
put up with my many moods and absences. My family and friends also provided much
valued support and encouragement. I thank them all for their patience and understanding.

Note on translations
Translations in this work are mostly my own. Those that are not are given in inverted
commas. Where English makes distinctions that Wambaya does not (such as definiteness in
NPs) I have made these distinctions in the English translations according to context.

      ergative/locative case marking on the subject noun suggests that there should be. Perhaps line 38 is the

7.1.7 MIRRA `SIT' AS A `COPULA'
  As in the examples above, it is possible for a clause to have a completely nominal predicate
and contain no verb at all. However, many of these clauses can also contain the verb, tnirra
5     We would expect that the converse would be the case for locative clauses: that it is the subject, rather
      than the predicate. which can be deleted anaphorically. Thus, we would expect that (example (7-23)), if
      given as a response to a question such as 'Where is the dog?', could be simply jalyu-ni 'on the bed'.
      Unfortunately the corpus does not contain the data needed to exemplify this.
178    Chapter 7`sit, be', and an auxiliary. The function of mirra in such examples is varied: only in a very
small number does it appear to have a `copula'-type function (example (7-34)); in others it
contributes further verbal meanings, as exemplified in the following.
   With locative clauses, the use of mirra implies `staying', `residing':

    With ascriptive verbless clause types it usually conveys a meaning of persistence (`is/was
still').

             The fingernail will become (i.e. grow) long (but it's short now).
   In a few examples, mirra appears to function as a copula; since tense is marked in the
auxiliary and an auxiliary can occur only in a verbal clause, mirra is used when it is necessary
to specify the tense of the clause. However, even in these examples, the presence of mirra
seems to indicate that a situation, state or event is being referred to.

   There are only a few particles in Wambaya. Particles have grammatical functions, such as
marking yes/no interrogative clauses, marking negation in declarative and imperative clauses,
and linking two finite clauses into a single complex clause. They are formally distinguished
from adverbs as they have strict positional restrictions: particles almost always occur in initial
position. Particles are discussed in §7.7.2.
3.1.2.3 arms
   Clitics can be distinguished from other non-inflecting word classes as they are bound
forms; they can not stand alone as words.10 There are three clitics in the corpus: =miji, =nima
and =minyi. Miji (glossed INFER') expresses epistemic mood; it indicates that the speaker
considers the proposition to be probable or possible, but does not know for sure whether or
not it is actual. It is an unrestricted clitic and is always encliticised to the initial word of the
clause. Nîma (glossed `NST') can usually be translated by English words such as `just',
`only' and `still', although in some examples it seems to have an emphatic function. It is a
restricted clitic which usually occurs with nominals, although it can also occur with verbs and
other word classes. The other clitic, =minyi (glossed `AGAIN'), is used only with verbs. It is
encliticised to the verb over which it has scope. These three clitics are discussed and
exemplified in §7.7.1.","[70, 71]"
"5     In dreamtime stories where this sort of a construction is common (e.g. `make oneself into a bird'), the
      verb yardi `put' is used reflexively, with the resultant state expressed as a subject complement. Thus:

          The two old women turned themselves into eaglehawks.
6     This is a type of bird — see Text 2 in Appendix A.
7     Wierzbicka (1988:116-117) discusses such constructions in Japanese. However, in Japanese these
      experiential sentences are only possible in the first person.
                                                                   Parts of speech and other preliminaries     49  For a more detailed discussion of verbless clauses and the use of mina as a copula-like
verb see §7.1.
   These adjectives are doubly interesting as they each have a homophonous verb form which
has the same meaning as the subjective meaning of the adjective. That these are verbs and not
adjectives is shown in the following examples in which the form co-occurs with an auxiliary
and takes no gender agreement with the subject NP.8
    (3-6)    Bagijbi gi            juruma.
             feel.bad 3SG.S(PR) stomach.I1I(NOM)

          feel.good 3SG.S-FUT heart.IV(NOM) see-LOC
          She will be happy to see (her). (lit. Her heart will feel good seeing (her).)
(iii) Free Pronouns
    Free pronouns form a small, closed class. They are referred to as 'free' to differentiate
them from the 'bound' pronouns that form part of the auxiliary (discussed below). Free
pronouns distinguish person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural) and.
make an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person non-singular. There are no third
person singular subject or object pronouns; demonstratives are used instead.
   Free pronouns have a different system of case marking from nouns and adjectives. While
nouns and adjectives have an ergative/absolutive system of case marking, free pronouns have
a nominative/accusative declension with nominative and ergative case forms being
homophonous- Free pronouns also have an oblique form which is used in the dative case and
as the base for the addition of other case suffixes such as the comitative. In the case of non-
singular pronouns, this oblique form is homophonous with the accusative case form.
a    It is interesting to consider the possible relationship between the verbs and their corresponding adjectives.
     The final jbi of the adjective gurijbi (and also bagijbi) is identical to a final sequence that in Wambaya is
     quite distinctively verbal. There are many verbs that have this form: ngajbi 'see', gajbi 'eat', nyagajbi 'be
     tired', and it is also found in verbs derived from adjectives with the inchoative suffix jbi: yarduga
     'strong' (Iv) becomes varduga jbi 'become strong' (see §6.2.2.1). This suggests that the adjective gurijbi
     may be derived from the verb gurijbi, thereby accounting for its verb-like form. This theory is supported
     by the other gender forms of the adjective which are all based on this (verbal) form. The usual case
     among adjectives is for the Class iv form to he identical to the root, and therefore to serve as the base for
     the derivation of the other gender forms (see §4.2.2). However with gurijbi it is the Class I form (which
     is identical to the verbal form) from which the other forms are derived. This is shown most clearly by the
     Class II form gurijbi-rna in which the Class Ii gender suffix is simply added on to the full Class I form.
     The situation with bagijbi is different in at least two respects. Firstly, there is some variation among
     speakers as to whether the Class I form of the adjective is correctly pronounced bagijbi or bagiji. For
     some speakers either form is possible, for others only the latter is possible as the Class I form of the
     adjective. And secondly, the other gender forms are not derived from the Class I (and verbal) form, as is
     the case with gurijbi, but are clearly all derived (quite regularly) from a common root bagig - :
          Class I     bagiji/(bagijbi)
          Class 11 bagi-nga
          Class III baging-ma
          Class Iv bagi-ga
     The verbal form bagijbi is clearly also derived from this root.
     The next question is why, if the Class I form of the adjective is actually bagiji, it is often pronounced
     bagijbi, which is the verbal form? It seems quite probable that this could have happened on analogy with
     gurijbi, particularly as it is quite common in fast speech for both gurijbi and bagijbi to he pronounced
     guriji and bagiji respectively (even for the verbal form).
50     Chapter 3Singular pronouns have homophonous nominative, accusative and ergative case forms and
then a different oblique form. Free pronouns are discussed in §4.8.
(iv) Demonstratives
   Demonstratives in Wambaya make a two-way spatial distinction which is roughly
comparable to the distinction in English between `this' and `that'. Demonstratives must also
agree with their referent in case, gender and number. Like nouns and adjectives,
demonstratives can occur alone as the head of a NP, or function as a modifier. Demonstratives
are discussed in §4.6.
(v) Locational nominals
   These nominals are inherently locative and include the compass directionals (langga
`north', ngîrnii `south', gagarra `east', bayungu `west'), other general directionals (gayangga
`up', jangi `down'), locational demonstratives (gili `here', gîlîyaga `there') and other
locationals such as murrgu `inside'. Although these locational nominals can be inflected with
the allative and ablative cases, they are distinguished from other nominals by not taking the
locative case; they occur uninflected in a locative NP:
     (3-8)   Mirra gî-n              murrgu.
             sit    3SG.S(PR)-PROG inside
             She's sitting inside.
(vi) Temporal nominals
   Temporal nominals provide temporal information for the clause and thus tend to have co-
occurrence restrictions with the tense of the clause. Temporal nominals are found in the
corpus with only the locative and dative nominal case suffixes; for example ngurraramba-nî
`in the night' (night-LOC) and ngijininîma-nka `until tomorrow' (tomorrow-DAT).
(vii) Indefinite/interrogatives
   Cross-cutting this division of nominals is the subclass of indefinite/interrogatives. These
nominals can be used both as interrogatives (e.g. `who') and as indefinites (e.g. `someone').
There are indefinite/interrogative pronouns (e.g. gayini `who, someone/what, something'),
quantifiers (e.g. yangulany- `how many, some amount'), locationals (e.g. injani `where,
somewhere'), and temporals (e.g. yangulu `when, sometime'). Indefinite/interrogatives tend
to occur initially in the clause. These nominals are discussed in §4.7.","[66, 67, 68]"

   There are a number of interesting comparisons that can be made between the gender-
marking systems of the Mirndi languages. Firstly, there is a large amount of consistency,
particularly in Classes II and III. For example, the form nga occurs as a non-absolutive Class
It marker in all languages, on both nouns and demonstratives. And all languages but Jingili
have either nya or rna or both as a Class II absolutive marker (note that this nya turns up in
Jingili as the `gender base' in the Class II demonstrative; see above). Jingili is interesting in
this respect as the Class II nominal absolutive suffixes all have final /i/, whereas Class II in all
of the other languages is consistently marked with /a/, Class I being marked with /i/.
   Class m is consistently marked with ma or mi (as in Jingili) in the absolutive. It is
interesting that both Wambaya and Nungali have ma in the absolutive and mi in the non-
absolutive, while in Jingili this is reversed, mi being absolutive and ma non-absolutive.?
   Other interesting correspondences are the Class I non-absolutive suffixes -nî in the Eastern
Group languages, and -(r)nî in Jingili; and -nyi in the Eastern Group languages and the
ergative/locative/instrumental prefix nyî- in Nungali. The rare Class I non-absolutive
Wambaya suffix -di is the same as the Class I absolutive prefix di- in Nungali.
   The Class II non-absolutive suffix -ga, which is restricted to some kin terms in Wambaya
and Ngarnga, shows up as a more general Class II non-absolutive suffix in Jingili and as part
of the Class II dative prefix in Nungali. In fact the correspondence between the Wambaya and6     From Bolt, Hoddinott and Kofod (1971b:63, 68-69, 75-76, 89-90).
7     Note that prefixes such as ma-, mi- and m- are very common in all non-Pama-Nyungan languages
      marking a class which refers to non-flesh food, probably deriving from an earlier generic noun mayi (see
      Dixon 1980:273).
                                                    Comparative discussion of gender marking    263the Nungali Class II non-absolutive forms is very neat: Nungali has nganyi-, nyanyi- (ERG)
and ganyi- (DAT) and Wambaya has -nga, -nya and -ga.
   There is also a certain degree of similarity among the Class Iv markers. The Class Iv
suffix -ga found with some adjectives in Wambaya, is found as a prefix on Class Iv
demonstratives in Binbinka, and is similar to the Class Iv dative prefixes in Nungali (gi-, gu-)
and the gender base in the Class Iv demonstrative in Jingili: gu-. An original prefix gu- has
been retained in at least two Class iv Wambaya words: gurdurlu `heart' and guyiga `fire',
which are cognate with Nungali dulu and -yug respectively (Bolt, Hoddinott and Kofod
(1971b:143, 145)).
   Table B5 contains the gender markers for each language that appear to have
correspondences in one or more of the other languages. In this table many distinctions made
in the more detailed tables above have been collapsed (such as the distinction between
ergative and dative non-absolutive forms in Jingili and Nungali). A question mark indicates
that the form is not known and a gap indicates that there is no correspondence in that
category. For the Binbinka dialect, only the demonstratives' gender markers have been
included; all other markers can be assumed to be the same as for Wambaya.

"   Given the similarities between the West Barkly gender suffixes and the Nungali prefixes it
is quite clear that they have derived from a single system. The interesting question, therefore,
is how they became suffixes in the West Barkly languages and prefixes in Nungali. There are
three different possibilities. Firstly, Chadwick (1978:336ff) proposes that the gender suffixes
of the modem West Barkly languages developed from ""postposed markers not previously
264     Appendix B
attached to the noun stem and simpler in form than the present suffixes"" (p.336). However,
this analysis does not account for why the demonstratives should have gender prefixes and
not suffixes. A second possible analysis is that the gender suffixes, or at least the postposed
gender markers, developed from the reduction of postposed demonstratives. The strongest
argument for this analysis is that it accounts for the absence of gender suffixes on
demonstratives themselves:8 we would not expect demonstratives to be postposed to
demonstratives. A third proposal, suggested by Ian Green (1995:421) combines both of these
two ideas. Green suggests that in Proto Mirndi the precursors of the present-day case
markers were in fact postposed to the nominals as separate words, as Chadwick suggests.
However, he also argues that Proto Mirndi at the same time had gender-prefixed
demonstratives which alternated with these postposed gender markers (these gender markers
belonging to the overall demonstrative paradigm), thus explaining why the demonstratives
did not acquire gender suffixes also. In the West Barkly languages, then, these postposed
markers became fused with the noun stems as suffixes, and in Nungali these developed into
prefixes on following modifers, later being also extended to head nouns. It may not be
possible to find evidence that would distinguish my proposal from Green's, although further
research is clearly required.
   In support of either of the latter two proposals is the strong similarity between the form of
the demonstrative gender prefixes and form of the pre-modern gender markers that Chadwick
reconstructs for the Eastern Group:
    Eastern Group pre-modern gender markers (from Chadwick 1978:336)
                I      II      III    IV
       ABS   Ji     ma ma a, u
       NABS  Ni nga
       (Where Ji denotes either ji or yi and Ni either nî or mi.)
   Except for Class IV, the forms of these markers are exactly the same as the Wambaya
prefixes found on demonstratives, and are also the same as the underlying gender suffixes
found with other nominals. The existence of Class Iv suffixes in Wambaya such as -ga and
-ja, as well as the demonstrative prefix ya-, suggests that the original Class IV marker may
have had an initial consonant, probably /g/. This is supported by the residual gu- prefix in
some Class iv forms (see above), the Binbinka Class Iv demonstrative prefix ga- and the
Class Iv demonstrative base in Jingili: -gu. Chadwick remains undecided as to whether the
pre-modern Class I absolutive marker should be reconstructed as jî or as yî. The fact that the
prefix ji- is found on some Class I demonstratives in Binbinka, and that it appears to be the
underlying Class I absolutive gender suffix on Wambaya nominals (see §4.2.2), suggests
that it may be better reconstructed as ji, with modern day (y)i forms (such as on Wambaya
demonstratives) having derived from ji by lenition of the initial consonant.","[281, 282]"

          He must be cold (because he's only wearing shorts).

=mijî expresses possibility, rather than probability, and is more like the English modal
'might'.

           Perhaps they're cooking. (In response to an inquiry as to some people's

   The clitic =miji is often used with indefinite/interrogatives in their indefinite function, in
which they indicate a lack of knowledge without asking that the information be supplied. This
function is discussed and exemplified more fully in §4.7. Examples include:
   (7-189) Gayinirna=miji       nayida             ng-u       yany-ba agardi-nka.

   In the only example in the corpus where =mijî is not encliticised to the initial element in the

           Someone must have let the water out behind me.
   The use of =miji with indefinites is similar to that of the particle /pangkal/ `might be, may
be' in Warumungu, which is used to create indefinites from interrogatives (Jane Simpson
pers.comm.). It is also similar to the use of the ignorative clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa
(Donaldson 1980:258ff).27 Note that 'might be' can be used in Aboriginal English in the
same way: Where is X? Might be somewhere.28
73.1.2 =-- NIMA 'JUST'
   The clitic =nima is a restricted clitic that has a number of related emphatic functions,
translating English words such as 'just', 'only' and 'still'. It is most commonly used with
nouns and adjectives, but can also be used with other parts of speech such as verbs (example27 However, the clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa has a different meaning than =miji in wamhaya. as its use with
    other word classes is inferred to be a request for the hearer to affirm or deny the correctness of the
    statement (Donaldson 1980:260). The use of =miji has no such implicature.

   It is possible for both the head noun and a modifier to host =nîma:

           ISG.POSS.IV(ACC)=JUST tobaccodV(ACC)=JUST ISG.A(PR) RDP-carry
           I carry around my own tobacco.
    In one example =nîma appears within the word giliyaga 'there'. This word is made up of
gilî `here' and the remote suffix -yaga (this suffix is found on most remote demonstratives;
see §4.6).
   (7-199) Mirra g-a            gili=nîma-yaga.
           sit     3SG.S-PST here=JUST-remote
           I stayed right there.
    The different uses of =nima are related by the fact that they all se rve to modify
presupposed expectations; the clitic functions as an expectation modifier (McConvell 1983),
highlighting deviation from a presupposition that something more or different would be
expected. In example (7-192), for instance, =nima denies the presupposition that the speaker
would have been given both meat and bread; in (7-195), it denies an expectation that the
travellers would have arrived at their destination already; and in (7-199) the function of =nima
is to deny the presupposition that the speaker went anywhere else. The 'counter-expectation'
meaning of (7-198) is not so obvious. However, this utterance was given in a context in
which the speaker was complaining about the fact that people always come and ask her for
                                                                          Syntax of simple sentences     207tobacco. Thus, =pima seems to be used to assert that the tobacco she carries is for her use
only, and not for anyone else' s 29
7.7.1.3 =MINY/ `AGAIN'
   The clitic -minyi `AGAIN' is used only with verbs. It is attached to the verb over which it
has scope. There are only a few examples of this clitic in the corpus, including:
     (7-200) Bardgu-j-ba=minyi g-u        galyurrungurna.
             fall-TH-FUT=AGAIN 3SG.S-FUT rain.II(NOM)
             It'll rain again.
     (7-201) Gannga=minyi              g-ulama.
              re turn(FUT)AGAIN 3S G. S-NP.T W D
              She'll come back again.
     (7-202) Gulugi-nka=minyi gi-n                   yugu.
             sleep-DAT=AGAIN 3SG.S(PR)-PROG cry
             He's crying to go back to sleep (i.e. because he's tired).
   As can be seen in the examples above, =minyî can be used with either of the two senses
that McConvell (1983) identi fies for English `again': (i) repetition of an action or situation
and (ii) return to a former position or state. In example (7-200) =minyi indicates repetition of
the full situation: it is true that the event of raining will be repeated. In (7-201) and (7-202) on
the other hand, =minyi indicates only a return to a former state or position, rather than a
repetition of the whole event. Thus (7-202), for example, means that `he' was asleep before
and that he is crying in order to return to that former state of sleeping. It does not mean that
the event of his crying has happened before and is now being repeated. Similarly, (7-201)
describes the situation in which `she' was here and will return to this former position. It does
not refer to a repetition of the event of returning.","[222, 223, 224, 225]"
"
8.2.1.2 ADJOINED CLAUSES AS NP MODIFIERS
   Adjoined clauses can also function adnominally, modifying a main clause NP. In this
function the modifying clause follows the NP which it modifies. In the examples in the
corpus, the adjoined clause modifies either the direct object (examples (8-39), (8-40)), an
oblique object (8-41) or one of the NPs of a verbless clause (8-38). There are no examples in
which the subject of a verbal clause is modified by a finite clause. The modified NP can have
either subject function ((8-39), (8-40), (8-41)) or object function (8-38) in the relative
clause.1616 This adnominal function can often be perfomed by a verb inflected with either the agentive or the
    privative suffix (both of which can derive a nominal from a verb). The difference between this type of
    relative clause and that which is expressed with a finite clause is that in this type the relative clause
    expresses a general characteristic rather than a specific action or event: 'he who is a fighter', rather than
    'he who is fighting'. A couple of examples are:
      (i) Dunn              ngi-n            marawunjini-nka dawu j-barlini-nka.

   Note that example (8-39), in a different context, could be a causal adjunct to the main
clause meaning `I'm going to hit the dog because it bit me'.
   In all of the examples above, the modifying finite clause is syntactically distinct from the
head NP, as evidenced by the fact that it constitutes a separate domain for the purposes of
auxiliary placement. However, a more common situation is for the head NP to immediately
precede the auxiliary of the modifying clause, thereby indicating that the NP and the finite
clause together form a complex NP. It is not yet known what semantic difference, if any,
exists between this type of construction and that exemplified in examples (8-38) to (8-41)
above.

   Adjoined clauses can function as clausal arguments of main clause verbs of speech or
perception such as îlinga 'hear, remember SCOMP', didima `tell (0) that SCOMP' and janganja
or bajiya `ask (0) (if) SCOMP'. In these constructions the subordinate clause always follows
the main clause. An example is:
   (8-47) Guyala ng-udi                ilinga      [injani g-a          yarru].
             NEG       ISG.A-NACT.PR remember where 3SG.S-PST go
             I can't remember where he went.
   With speech verbs the argument clause is usually an indirect speech quotation in which the
speaker paraphrases the utterance being reported (examples (8-48), (8-49)). When it is the
argument of janganja or bajiya, both of which mean `ask', the finite clause is usually
translated with a concealed question ((8-50), (8-51)).

   Often the clausal argument of a speech verb is direct quoted speech. In this case, the
speech is reported with all of the deïctic categories (i.e. person, tense, etc.) having as their
reference the speech situation being referred to, rather than that of the present:

   A particularly common construction for quoting speech in story-telling involves the verb
ngajbi `see', which in this construction takes the finite clause as an argument. This
construction is used when the speaker is reporting an observation made (either in speech or in
thought) by one of the story's characters, and appears to play an important role in the
progression of the story by setting the scene for the next event. is It is difficult to translate this
construction into English; a close approximation might be `X looked/noticed and said Y' or
even, `X noticed that Y', without any direct speech (example (8-54)). There are many
examples in the texts in Appendix A; some selected examples follow.

1    Wambaya is alone among the McArthur dialects in inflecting the verb for tense: in neither Gudanji nor
     Binbinka is the verb inflected in main clauses (Chadwick 1978:84). In Ngarnga, the verb also shows a
     future/non-future contrast: however, interestingly, the basic verb form (i.e. that which corresponds to the
     non-future verb form in Wambaya) is used in the future tense, while verbs in past and present tenses are
     inflected with the suffix -ani (p.85).
2    The thematic      of 7 Class verbs also appears before derivational suffixes such as -barli- 'AGNT' and
     -baja- 'PRIV'. For example:
         dag    j-moi hit-TH-AGNT (I)
         daguma j-baji     hit-TH-PRIV (I)
3.   The non-future tense form of a verb is also the citation form, and thus is more like a general unmarked
     form (see below).
                                                     157
158    Chapter 6   Note that the three nominal suffixes -ni, -nka and -nnga are preceded here with /i/. This is
an epenthetic vowel which occurs between the final consonant of a verb stem (whether this
consonant is the final consonant of the root itself, or the thematic consonant /j/) and a
following suffix with an initial nasal. The epenthetic vowel breaks up what would otherwise
be an impossible consonant cluster. (A nasal can be the second element of a consonant cluster
only when it is preceded by a hetero-organic nasal; see §2.2.3). When the details of verbal
morphological structure are not significant I will not segment this epenthetic vowel in
examples in this work, but will group it with the preceding morpheme. For example:
      daguma ji-nka     hit-TH-DAT (NOT daguma j-î-nka )
      ngarli-nka        talk-DAT    (NOT ngarl-i-nka)
   Some examples of inflected verbs from each class are given in Table 6.2. Due to lack of
space, the inflection of only one of the nominal suffixes (-nka) is exemplified. Irregular verbs
are given in Table 6.4 below. In all of the following tables an underline indicates that the
corresponding form is not present in the corpus.

   *Note that the final consonant of this root is dropped before an inflection with initial /b/. I
have no explanation for this as /gb/ is a permissible consonant cluster in Wambaya (e.g.
gulugbi `sleep'). See §2.2.3 for a discussion of consonant clusters in Wambaya.
   As can be seen in Table 6.2, membership of the two conjugation classes is phonologically
determined: verbs with vowel-final roots belong to the J Class and those with consonant-final
roots belong to the 0 Class.
                                                                                   Verbs    159   An alternative analysis for the verbs of the J Class would be to consider the /j/ as in fact
belonging to the verb root, rather than being thematic. Under this analysis the non-future
suffix would still be -0, but the final consonant of the root would be dropped according to
the general phonotactic constraint that words in Wambaya be vowel-final (see §2.2).
However, if the roots of J Class verbs contain a final /j/, then there is no obvious explanation
as to why these verbs belong to a different class than other verbs, such as ngaj- `see', which
also have fj/-final roots. Under the `thematic /jr analysis however, this inconsistency is
avoided as the roots of these two verbs are different: one (daguma-) is vowel-final and the
other (ngaj-) is consonant-final.
  There is some evidence, however, to suggest that /j/ may once have been part of the verbal
root, or even part of the non-future inflection, -bi. For example, many of the verbs of the J
Class have cognates in other languages/dialects of the Eastern. Group that have final
jbi in the non-future fornt4

   One of the particularly interesting things about the Wambaya verbal inflections is their
striking similarity to some of the verbal inflections in Garrwa, a language which borders
Wambaya but appears otherwise unrelated to it. According to the analysis of Garrwa verbs
proposed by Belfrage (1992:46), Garrwa has five verbal conjugation classes. Of these five
there are two which show substantial similarity to the two Wambaya classes and are also
referred to by Belfrage as the J conjugation class and the 0 conjugation class. Table 6.3 gives
the forms of the inflections for these two Garrwa verbal conjugation classes.
    TABLE 6.3: GARRWA J AND 0 CONJUGATION CLASSES (FROM BELFRAGE 1992:46)                                            J              0

                        Sequential          -jiwa          -(bi)jîwa
                        Same subject        -jina          -(bi)jîna
                        Different subject   -(j)kurri      -(bî)kurri
                        Infinitive          -(j)kanyi      -(bi)kanyi
   Thus, Class J verbs in Garrwa have the same /jb/ sequence in their unmarked form that is
so distinctive to verbs in Wambaya. Furthermore, the unmarked inflections of these two
classes in Garrwa are identical to the future tense inflections that occur in the respective
Wambaya classes. And the Wambaya non-future inflection, -bi, turns up (optionally) before4   The Ngamga information is taken from Chadwick (1971). The Gudanji information is from my own
    field notes.
160    Chapter 6the other inflections of the 0 Class in Garrwa. Another point of comparsion is the Garrwa
`same subject' inflection which is very similar in form to the `same subject' inflection (i.e. the
ergative/locative case) in the J Class in Wambaya: j-ini. This inflection in Wambaya is used
to mark same subject in non-finite clauses that are simultaneous with the main clause (see
§8.1). In Wambaya this inflection is analysed as consisting of the thematic consonant r/,
followed by the epenthetic vowel /i/ and then the ergative/locative case inflection -ni. The
Garrwa inflection also appears to be based on the locative inflection, which is -na in Garrwa
(Belfrage 1992:13). Although it is not unusual for the locative case inflection to be used to
mark same subject in this region (see Austin 1981b), it is interesting here that the two
inflections both precede the locative suffix with the sequence /ji/. In Garrwa however, unlike
Wambaya, the full form -jina is also used with the 0 Class. In Wambaya the form that occurs
with the 0 Class is -ini. There is clearly need for more detailed comparative work between
these two languages.
   There are a number of irregular Wambaya verbs which do not belong to either of the two
conjugation classes discussed here. Table 6.4 gives the forms of such verbs that are present
in the corpus, along with the regular verbs daguma `hit' and ngajbi `see' for comparison
(non-italicised). A question mark indicates that the form given is hypothesised, but not
confirmed.

   The verb mirra is irregular in not taking the non-future tense inflection -bi, as other
consonant-final verb roots do. Wugbardi has an irregular alternative future tense form. Both
gajurru and nanganangali have irregular infinitive forms and gajurru, along with ganjimi, has
an irregular future tense form. The remaining five verbs are irregular in that they do not
distinguish future and non-future tense. Furthermore, verbs such as yarru and gannga have
alternative infinitive and/or DAT forms, one of which contains the corresponding regular J
Class inflection. Yugu takes the 0 Class infinitive inflection but the J Class DAT inflection.

6.1 INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY
6.1.1 NON-FUTURE INFLECTION
   As discussed above, the non-future suffix is either -0 (with vowel-final stems) or -bi
(with consonant-final stems). The non-future form of the verb is also the citation form of the
verb and thus may in fact be better considered as the unmarked form. The non-future
inflection is used in both past and present tenses and can also be used in the immediate future
tense (examples (6-1) and (6-2)) in which case it is accompanied by future tense marking in
the auxiliary. This is one case in which there is a mismatch between the tense marking in the
auxiliary and that on the verb.5

            go(FUT) SG.IMP.TWD this.way THEN 1DU.INC.S-FUT talk-NF
            Come here so that we can talk!
  The non-future form of the verb can also be found in some imperative constructions:
  (6-3)     Alyu nyi-ng-a                  daguma-0!
            NEG.IMP 2SG:A-IO-NF            hit-NF
            Don't hit me!
  (6-4)     Bard-bi garna!
            run-NF SG:IMP.AWY
            Run over there!
  Imperative constructions are discussed in more detail in §6.1.2.
   Its appearance in some future and imperative constructions as well as the fact that it is
always the citation form of the verb suggests that the non-future form is really more like an
unmarked verb form. Therefore, I will treat it as unmarked in example sentences elsewhere in
this work:
     dagunta      hit    (not 'hit(NF)')
     ngajbi      see (not ngaj-bi `see-NF')
6.1.2 FUTURE INFLECTION
   The future tense suffix is -ba, or -wa after liquids. As well as being used in future tense
clauses (examples (6-5) and (6-6)), the future tense suffix also marks imperative mood ((6-7)
and (6-8)). While they contain the same verbal inflection, an imperative construction is
distinguished from a future tense construction since the auxiliary in an imperative
    See Table 6.5 for the possible combinations of verbal and auxiliary tense categories.
162     Chapter 6
construction usually carnes non-future tense marking (6-7) while in a future tense
construction it carries future tense marking (6-5). (See §5.5 for a discussion of the auxiliary
in imperative constructions and Table 6.5 for the interaction between auxiliary and verbal
tense categories). Recall that a future tense construction, such as in example (6-5), can have a
polite imperative reading (see §5.5 for more examples).

   In two types of imperative constructions — negative imperative constructions and
constructions containing imperative directional suffixes — it is possible for the verb to appear
without future tense marking. Examples include (6-3) and (6-4) above, and the following:
    (6-9)     A lyu     junmi/junmi-j-ba!
              NEG.IMP cut(NF)/Cut-TH-FUT
              Don't cut it!
    (6-10) Alyu      nyi-ng-a   daguma/daguma j-ba!
           NEG.IMP 2SG.A-IO-NF hit(NF)/hit-TH-FUT
           Don't hit me!
    (6-11)    Wugbardi gama!      OR Wugbardi -j-ba gama!
              cook(NF) SG.IMP.AWY    cook-TH-FUT
              Go and cook it!
    (6-12)    Gaj-bi girrama!   OR Gaj-ba girrama!
              eat-NF PL.IMP.TWD    eat-FUT
              Come and eat!
   The absence of future tense marking in these constructions can probably be accounted for
by the fact that the negative particle and the directional suffixes are specifically imperative.
Thus, with their presence the clause is already marked as imperative, rendering it unnecessary
for this to be also indicated on the verb.
   Verbs such as yarru `go' and yabu `take, have', which do not distinguish future and non-
future tense (see Table 6.4 above), always co-occur with directional suffixes in the imperative
mood. As these directional suffixes are inherently imperative, it is thus possible to make a
distinction between imperative clauses and future tense clauses with these verbs.6
6     Note that, as these verbs make no distinction between future and non-future tenses, the glossing of them
      as `FUT' in these examples is, to a certain extent, arbitrary.

   (6-14)   Yarns g-ulama           ginmanji.

            take(FUT) 3SG.M.A-NP.AWY mother.11-ALL
            He will take her to (her) mother.
   The fact that these verbs often occur with directional suffixes, which themselves mark
imperative mood and tense (in indicative clauses), may explain why it is that they are not
overtly inflected for tense themselves; we have already seen examples in which the verbal
inflection is omitted when it co-occurs with directional suffixes (examples (6-11) and (6-12)
above). However, even in clauses without directional suffixes, these verbs are not overtly
inflected for future tense:
  (6-17)    Yarru       ng-u   marndijî.
            go(FUT) 1 SG.S-FUT later
            I'll go later.
  (6-18)    Yabu       ny-u         garnguji alaji.
            have(FUT) 2SG.A-FUT many.I(ACC) boy.I(ACC)
            You'll have lots of kids.
   The future tense inflection is used both in imperative constructions (as discussed above)
and in future tense constructions (examples (6-5) and (6-6)). In clauses with immediate future
tense however, and in negative future tense clauses, the verb occurs in the non-future form.
For examples of clauses with immediate future tense see (6-1) and (6-2). Some examples of
future tense negative clauses follow.
  (6-19)    Yangula irr-agba        jiyawu.
            NEG       3PLA-HYP give(NF)
            They will not give it to him.
  (6-20)    Yangula ng-agba        ngara-bi ngijininima.
            NEG         tSG.A-HYP drink-NF tomorrow
            I will not drink tomorrow.
   Table 6.5 shows the possible combinations of auxiliary and verbal tense categories.?
Recall that the tense categories of the auxiliary differ depending on the number of the subject
bound pronoun and the presence/absence of an object bound pronoun (§5.2.1). Thus, some
auxiliaries will collapse some of the distinctions made in this table. Note also that some of
these marking patte rns are optional; that is auxiliaries in imperative constructions can actually
have no tense marking at all (see §5.5).","[175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]"

3.2.2 DEFINING SUBJECT, OBJECT AND INDIRECT OBJECT
   Following are the properties by which subjects, objects and indirect objects can be
characterised and identified in Wambaya.
SUBJECT I7  (i)      Subject NPs take either the ergative case (A) or the nominative case (S).
 (ii)      In a main verbal clause or a finite subordinate clause, the subject is represented by a
           bound pronoun in the first position in the auxiliary.
 (iii)     In a non-finite subordinate clause the subject is the pivot and is obligatorily omitted,
           being identical to a core argument of the main clause (see §8.1).
 (iv)      In a simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
           nominal suffix -nî, the main-clause subject is that which is co-referential with the
           (omitted) subordinate-clause subject.
 (v)       In a reduced adjoined clause the subject is the pivot and is omitted, being co-
           referential with the subject of the preceding clause (see §8.2).18
16 I have not tested the limits of these combinations. For example, what is the limit on the number of non-
     core functions that can occur within a clause? And is it possible to have the complete set of dative
     functions within the one clause? Consider, for example, 'I talked to the woman (indirect object) about
     language (complement) for money (adjunct)'.
17 Note that this discussion does not help to identify or define the properties of a subject in a verbless
     clause. There are often difficulties with formally identifying the subject in such clauses (e.g. see Morphy
     (1983) on Djapu). Verbless clauses are discussed in §7.I.
18 In a non-reduced adjoined clause, the subject can be identified from the auxiliary by (ii).
                                                        Parts of speech and other preliminaries   57OBJECT
  (i) Object NPs take the accusative case.
 (ii) First and second person objects are represented by a bound pronoun in the second
      position in the auxiliary. ('Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary; see
      §5.2).
      The main-clause object is that which is co-referential with the (omitted) subject of a
      simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
      infinitive suffix -barda (see §8.1).
    Some ditransitive verbs subcategorise for two accusative objects, only one of which is
registered in the auxiliary (see §7.2). I thus make a distinction between direct objects, to
which the above three generalisations apply, and second objects, which are characterised by
(i), but not (ii) and (iii).
INDIRECT OBJECT
   The evidence for indirect object is considerably weaker than that for subject and object.
Indirect objects are marked with the dative case and are never represented in the auxiliary and
are thereby distinguished from subjects and objects. Indirect objects can be distinguished
from dative adjuncts and complements in that they are subcategorisable and semantically
unrestricted, and are thereby core functions. In addition, unlike other complements and
adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal constructions, in which
case the indirect object argument is registered on the auxiliary with the reflexive/reciprocal
pronoun (see examples (3-29) and (3-30)). As shown in (3-31) to (3-34), this is not possible
for dative adjuncts.

                                             NOMINALS4.1 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NOMINAL WORD
  The structure of the nominal word is:1
      Root + (deriv) + (adnom) + (number) + gender# + ([GEN + gender*j) + (case)
     deriv = A derivational suffix (§4.5)
     adnom = The proprietive suffix (§4.4.11), privative suffix (§4.4.12) or `origin'
           suffix (§4.4.13)
     GEN   = The genitive suffix (§4.4.10)
           The only situation in which this slot is not obligatory is when the dual number
           suffix is present.
     *     This gender slot must agree with the gender of the possessed noun.
   There are no examples in the corpus in which case marking follows the genitive suffix,
although such constructions are accepted by speakers as grammatical. There are also no
examples in which a derivational suffix is followed by an adnominal suffix, although it is
conceivably possible in a word such as ?yugu-warli-ngunya `cry-AGNT.I-PROP.II(NOM)'
meaning `(woman) having a crying (child)'.
   Although there is not an example in which all of these slots are filled, the following few
examples attest to the above ordering and degree of complexity.
  ROOT + ADNOM + NUMBER + GENDER + CASE:
  (4-1) gijilulu-nguj-ball-nî-ni
        money-PROP-PL-I-LOC
        the men with money (ergative/locative)
  ROOT + DERIV + NUMBER + GENDER + CASE:
  (4-2) ngara-barli-marnda-nga-ni
        drink-AGNT-PL-II-LOC
        the women drunks (ergative/locative)
  ROOT + GENDER + GEN + GENDER:
  (4-3) bungma-nyi-niganka (maga)
        old.man I GEN.IV       (camp.w(NOM))
        the old man's (camp) (nominative)
   Some of the adnominal and number suffixes are inconsistent as to the form of the nominal
that they take as their stem. While most suffixes are attached to the root of the nominal, there
are some examples in which such suffixes take the citation form of the nominal, including the
gender suffix, as their stem. For example the number suffix -rdarra `GROUP' (see §4.3.3.4)
always follows gender marking, unlike the other plural suffixes which must precede gender
marking (see examples (4-1) and (4-2) above):    This template does not represent the structure of demonstratives or pronouns. These nominal subtypes
    are discussed in §4.6 and §4.8 respectively.
                                                   58
                                                                                            Nominals     59    (4-4) garngu-nva-rdarra
          many-II-GROUP(NOM)
          a big group (of women) (nominative)
   Other suffixes, such as the proprietive suffix, attach to the root of some nominals
(example (4-5)) and to the citation form of others (4-6). One possibility is that the root
functions as the stem when the gender of the 'base' nominal is unimportant, but that the
suffix follows the citation form when the gender of the underived noun is relevant. For
example, there may be alternative forms of (4-5) such as ala-jî-ngunya `child-I-PROP.II(NOM)''
meaning 'female with boy child' and ala-nga-ngunya `child-II-PROP.II(NOM)' meaning `female
with girl child'. However, this question will need to be followed up in the field.
    (4-5) alag-unya
          child-PROP.II(NOM)
          female with child
    (4-6) mangany-ma-ngunya2
          tucker-III-PROP.II(NOM)
          female with tucker
   These examples suggest that the above nominal template should include a provision in the
root slot for another optional gender marker, with the restriction that it is only filled in some
nominals that contain either the proprietive or privative suffix, or when the -rdarra number
suffix is present. The revised nominal word template would then be as follows:
    [Root (+gender)] + (deriv) + (adnom) + (number) + gender + ([Gen + gender]) + (case)
with the same conditions and abbreviations as given above.","[74, 75, 76, 77]"

              FIGURE 1.1: WAMBAYA SUBSECTIONS (FROM ROBERT HOOGENRAAD)   The terms in Table 1.3 fall into two types: those which mark gender with a prefix (n V- for
female and jV- for male) and have final -ma, and those that mark it with a suffix (e.g.
ban garinji/bangarinya, balyarrinji/balyarrinya and yagamarri/yagamarrirna). It is only the
terms of the first type that have the alternative forms, which substitute either -gu (male) or
-gurna (female) for -ma . In these alternative forms gender is marked both by prefix and by
suffix.
    The Wambaya subsection terms do not fit neatly with the different sets of terms discussed
by McConvell (1985) and appear to be a mix of his Proto-Southwestern and Proto-
Northeastern sets of terms 2 2 As Wambaya is geographically between both groups, that they
may have borrowed some terms from each is perhaps not surprising. The gender prefixes jV-
(male) and nV- (female) present in five pairs of forms are clearly related to the gender
prefixes in McConvell's (p.29) Proto Southwestern forms: *ja- and *na-. Of the five pairs of
terms that have these prefixes, four have roots which also appear to be related to the
corresponding Proto Southwestern forms reconstructed by McConvell: jiyinama/niyinama
(*-panangkn). jurrulcrrna/nurrulama (* purrurla), jangalama/nangalama (*-ngala) and
jîtiamarrama/niyamarrama (*kamarra). However, one prefixed pair, jurlanynur/nurlanynra, is22 Note that the following discussion is purely impressionistic and should be taken as speculative.
12    Chapter 1
a little puzzling as it contains the Southwestern prefixes, but has a root which is similar to a
form belonging to McConvell's Proto-Northeastern set of subsection terms, *purlany.
    The reconstructed forms to which bangarinji/bangarinya and balyarrinjilbalyarrinya are
related are common to both the Proto Southwestern and Proto Northeastern sets; however,
the absence of gender prefixes in the Wambaya reflexes suggest that they may have come
from the north-east, rather than the south-west. Yagamarri/yagamarrirna is not clearly related
to the pragmatically equivalent Proto Southwestern or Proto Northeastern forms but may be
derived from the same root as jiyanrarrama/niyarrutrrama, which is *l amarra in both sets of
prototerms. Note that these two subsections would belong to the one section in a section
system (such as the Kariera system). One possibility is that Wambaya has borrowed
jîyamarrama/niyamarrama from its southern neighbours and yagantarri/yagamarrirna from its
northern neighbours.23 Interestingly, the pairs of terms that are suggested here as corning
from the north-east, as opposed to the south-west, do not correspond with the structure of
either a section system or a moiety system. This would suggest that the borrowing of
subsection terms from either the north-east or the south-west into Wambaya has not been on a
completely systematic basis.
   Table 1.3 only shows first-choice marriage partners. A man's first-choice marriage partner
is someone who belongs to the same subsection as his mother's mother's brother's
daughter's daughter (i.e. his second cross-cousin). However, this is not his only possible
marriage partner; there are second- and third-choice partners also. A man's second-choice
marriage partner is someone in the same subsection as his mother's mother and his third-
choice is someone in the same subsection as his father's sister's daughter (i.e. his first cross-
cousin).24
  For example, Bangarinji's first choice is Yagamarrirna (as his mother is Nurrulana whose
mother is Balyarrinya whose brother is Balyarrinji whose daughter is Nurlanyma whose
daughter is Yagamarrîrna). His second choice is Balyarrinya (as his mother is Nun-ulama
whose mother is Balyarrinya). His third choice is Niyamarrarna (as his father is Jiyinanta
whose sister is Niyinama whose daughter is Niyarnarrama).
    As noted above, five of the subsections have alternative forms which differ only in the
final syllable(s): the first set of forms have final -ma for both male and female terms, as
opposed to the second set which have final -gu (male) or -gurna (female). Speakers claim that
there is no difference between these two sets and that they are simply alternative Wambaya
forms. However, it is the first set that is most frequently used and I suspect that the second
set (those in parentheses in Table 1.3) belong to another of the Eastern Group languages/
dialects. This is supported by the fact that Spencer and Gillen (1904) give terms similar to
these as the subsection terms for `Gnanji' (Ngarnga). The 'Binbingha' (Binbinka) subsection
terms given in Mathews (1908) also appear to be the same forms. These sets of terms are
given in Tables 1.4 and 1.5 below, with the corresponding term from Table 1.3 given in
italics.","[28, 29, 30]"

7.2.5.1 SIMPLE TRANSITIVE VERBS
   Most of the transitive verbs are of this type; they subcategorise for an ergative subject NP
and an accusative object NP. It is very difficult to generalise about the semantic characteristics
of simple transitive verbs as they are great in number and varied in meaning. Some examples
are verbs of (i) physical impact or effect (whether desirable or undesirable), such as daguma
'hit O', anmurru `cuddle o',: burlurlandu `blow o away, blow O about', dudiyarri `spear 0',
jarungbî 'kiss O', angbardî 'build O', wugbardi `cook O' mujumi 'gather O'; (ii) perception,.

   One transitive verb, ganjimi 'finish o', can take a non-finite subordinate clause in place of
the object argument (i.e. 'finish doing'). In this case the subordinate verb is inflected with the
locative case suffix, which is usually used in simultaneous clauses to mark same subject {see
§8.1)

   A few transitive verbs have alternative ditransitive case frames in which they appear with
an additional indirect object. Such verbs in the corpus include ngirra `steal O (from 10)'
andajarri 'hide o (from IO)', inma `side with O (against IO)"", and didbidbun,ga 'argue with O

7.6 NEGATION
7.6.1 SENTENTL&L NEGATION
7.6.1.1 NEGATION OF INDICATIVE CLAUSES
   There are two alternative constructions available for negating an indicative clause, each
containing a different negative particle (glossed NEG). Although speakers claim that the two
constructions have the same meaning, the distribution of each construction in the corpus
suggests that there is in fact a difference in usage between the two I will discuss this
difference below, but first I will explain and exemplify the structural characteristics of the
constructions.
200    Chapter 7   The constructions are primarily distinguished by the form of the negative particle —
yangula or guyala — which appears in initial position in the clause.20 Guyala is also used
alone to mean `no, nothing'; yangula is never used in this function. There is one other respect
in which the two constructions differ: while both particles (usually) require the presence of
the hypothetical suffix in the auxiliary in future clauses, only guyala has the further
requirement that the auxiliary contain an irrealis mood suffix in past and present tense
clauses. In past and present tense clauses with yangula the auxiliary has the same form that it
would in the corresponding positive sentence. Examples include the following. Note that in
future tense negative clauses the verb does not inflect for future tense (see §6.1.2):
   (7-155) Guyala ng-uda                     gajbî manganyma.
             NEG        ISG.A-NACT.PST eat            tucker.Ill(ACC)
             I couldn't eat any dinner.
   (7-156) Guyala ngurr-uji                      ngajbi irra.
             NEG        1PL.INC.A-NACT.PR see               3PL.ACC
             We never see them.
   (7-157) Yangula îrri-ng-a       jiyawu.
           NEG      3PL.A-l 0-NF give
           They didn't give me (my country).
   (7-158) Yangula îrri-n                      nananga guri-guriny-mi.
              NEG         3PL.A(NP)-PROG care.for           RDP-good-FAC
             They're not looking after her properly.
   (7-159) Yangula gurl-agba ganmami.
           NEG       2DU.S-HYP get.close
           You can't get close.
   (7-160) Guyala ng-agba yandu bungmanya-nka.
              NEG        ISG.S-HYP wait old.woman.II-DAT
              I'm not going to wait for the old woman.
   (7-161) Yangula nga-ngg-agba duga-jirrimi.
              NEG         1 SG.A-RR-HYP sit.down-CAUS
              I'm not going to sit (myself) down.
   It seems that when a negative indicative clause has immediate future tense, the auxiliary
does not contain the hypothetical suffix. In this case yangula clauses usually have simple
future tense marking (example (7-162)) and guyala clauses often have present tense irrealis
marking (7-163).
   (7-162) Yangula ngu-ny-u                   daguma.
              NEG         1 SG.A-20-FUT       hit
              I'm not going to hit you.
   (7-163) Guyala ng-udi                   gamanula gunyanga-nmanji.
              NEG         1 SG.A-NACT.PR. send       other.Il-ALL
              I won't send her to another (girl).","[217, 218]"
"
21 . These reasons could be: a physical or mental inability to; the fact that doing so may he contravening
     social rules or norms; the fact that someone else won't allow you to, ctc.
22 I am indebted to Jane Simpson for this observation.
23 Interestingly, as drawn to my attention by Tracy King, Georgian also has a similar lexicalised distinction
     between two negative particles (Aronson 1989:145).
202     Chapter 7   (7-172) Yangula îrri-ng-a          jiyawu.
              NEG         3PL.A-10-PSTgive
              They didn't give me (my country).
   Apparent counterexamples, such as (7-163) repeated below, in which guyala is translated
with English `won't' rather than `can't', can probably be explained in terms of social/cultural
expectations and notions of appropriateness. Thus, in this example the speaker may be
indicating that she will not send the girl (her granddaughter) to live with another woman,
since she would consider this to be inappropriate for cultural, social, or personal reasons.
              Guyala ng-udi              gamarnda gunyanga-nmanji.
              NEG       1 SG.A-NACT.PR   send     other.II-ALL
              I won't send her to another (girl).
   This semantic difference between the two particles helps to explain their different
behaviour with respect to the irrealis markers in the auxiliary. If guyala is a negative modal
expressing `unlikelihood' then it is not surprising that it should require an irrealis marker in
the auxiliary, since these markers are often used to express modal meanings of `should' and
`would' in positive (usually counterfactual) sentences (see §5.2.4).24
   Verbless clauses are also negated with either guyala or yangula, although of the few
examples in the corpus most contain guyala. As shown in the following examples, the
negative particle may be either initial in the clause (example (7-173)) or initial in the predicate
(7-174).
   (7-173) Guyala Mama                    ngangi                 jugu,           Mama

           That's not my foot.","[219, 220]"
"
7.6.1.2 NEGATION OF IMPERATIVE CLAUSES
   Imperative clauses are negated with the use of the negative imperative particle alyu
(glossed `NEG.IMP') which must always be initial in the clause.25 In negative imperative
clauses the auxiliary (when present) appears in the non-future tense form and the verb can24 It is interesting that, given this semantic difference, it is guyala rather than yangula that is used as an
    interjection with the meaning 'no, nothing'. This may be due to politeness: in the face of a request. it is
    more polite to suggest that the reason for saying 'no' is beyond one's control than to simply refuse (e.g.
    I can 't versus I won't).
25 The Gudanji negative imperative particle is durdami. Note that, unlike in Wambaya (see §5.5).
    imperative clauses in Gudanji always have an auxiliary even when singular. Thus in a typical singular
    negative imperative clause, durdami is followed by the auxiliary nya.
       Durdami nya        nijbi!
       NEG.IMP SG.IMP       sing
       Don't sing!
      This is equivalent to the Wambaya Alyu nijbi!
                                                                    Syntax of simple sentences   203appear either with or without future tense marking. For a discussion of auxiliaries and verbs
in imperative clauses see §5.5 and §6.1.2 respectively. Some positive and negative pairs are:

             hit-TH-FUT  2SG.A-10(-NF)

4.8 FREE PRONOUNS
   While nominals generally operate on an ergative-absolutive system of case marking, free
pronouns (except for the possessive forms) have a nominative-accusative case marking
system; thus, ergative and nominative case forms are homophonous. There is also an oblique
pronoun form which is used in the dative case and serves as the base for other case forms.
Possessive pronouns, like all other nominals, have homophonous nominative and accusative
forms. They agree in gender, number and case with the noun that they modify and are the
only pronoun forms that can occur as a modifier in a NP.
   As was discussed in §4.4.3 above, there is just one nominal case that covers both ergative
and locative case functions. Unfortunately, there are no examples in the corpus of free
pronouns in the locative case and thus it is not possible to tell whether pronouns also collapse
the two cases, as all other nominals do.75 If it is found that pronouns formally distinguish
ergative and locative cases, following the line of argument presented in Goddard (1982), this
distinction should be extended to the class of nominals as a whole. Thus, the analysis
proposed here for all nominals would have to be changed such that there are two distinct
cases that simply have homophonous case marking. However, for present purposes I will
assume that pronouns behave as other nominals, but will gloss the ergative pronoun forms as
`ERG', rather than `LOC', since they are not found in locative function in the corpus.
   Nominative and ergative free pronouns are relatively uncommon and are largely used for
emphatic purposes, as are singular accusative free pronouns. Dual Lind plural accusative
pronouns are used more frequently since object bound pronouns in the auxiliary register only74   The glosses in this example are mine.
75 All attempts to elicit pronouns in the locative function produced either examples involving the allative
     case. or constructions which avoided the use of a pronoun all together. It may he that pronouns ate
     semantically incompatible with the locative case function in Wamhaya (as they appear to he with the
     instrumental case function, for example). Further research is required.
126     Chapter4person; the free object pronouns are therefore required to provide information as to the
number of the object (this is discussed in greater detail in §5.1).
   Table 4.18 contains the non-possessive pronoun forms. The possessive pronouns are
given in Table 4.19 below. Note that the language does not have any third person singular
non-oblique pronouns; when necessary, demonstratives are used instead (this is quite
common in Australian languages; see Dixon (1980)). As ergative and nominative forms are
homophonous, I have listed them together in Table 4.18.

   Note that there are no more than two forms for each pronoun. The singular pronouns have
homophonous nominative, ergative and accusative forms, and a different form for oblique,
while the non-singular pronouns have one form that covers nominative and ergative cases and
another one that is used for both accusative and oblique.
   The non-singular accusative/oblique forms are clearly derived from the non-singular
nominative/ergative forms. The non-singular nominative/ergative forms are made up of a
pronoun base followed by either -wani (after /u/) or -yani (after /i/). The accusative/oblique
forms are derived by replacing the final vowel of the pronoun base with /a/. Thus:
                    Pronoun Base NOM/ERG      ACC/OBL
       1DU.INC      mirndi-      mirndi-yani mirnd-a
       3DU          wurlu-       wurlu-wani wurl-a
   While the singular nominative, ergative and accusative forms are a little unpredictable, the
oblique forms also appear to consist of a pronoun base of which the final vowel is replaced
by /a/. This pronoun base is not found in any other non-possessive pronoun forms, but does
appear in the possessive pronouns; see below.

       3SG.M       nangi-          nang-a76    Evidence for the existence of the final vowels of these roots comes from the analysis of possessive
      pronouns and is discussed below.
                                                                                Nominals    127  In the third person singular feminine, which has a consonant-final base, the final
consonant of the base is dropped to form the oblique pronoun:
            Pronoun Base OBLique Form
      3SG.F ngayang-     ngaya
   The pronoun forms are basically the same for all three dialects of the McArthur group.
However, in Gudanji the non-singular accusative and oblique forms all contain the additional
final syllable -ga: mirndaga IDU.INC.ACC/OBL', wurlaga `3DU.ACC/OBL' and so on. It seems
that the Wambaya forms may have originally contained this syllable too, as it appears before
the comitative suffix (see below), and is present in the stem of the dative demonstratives (see
§4.6.1).
  Many examples of the use of these pronouns can be found throughout this volume. Some
more follow.

          I killed him for you (two).
   The oblique forms are used in the dative case (as in examples (4-285) and (4-286)) and
serve as the base for the comitative case forms. In the comitative case the suffix -yili is added
to the oblique form of the pronoun. In the singular forms, the final vowel of the oblique
pronoun assimilates to the vowel of the suffix:
   (4-287) Alajî          gi-n               mirra ngarri-yîlî.

            sit-FUT         tSG.S-FUT 2SG.OBL-COMIT
            I'll sit with you.
   In the non-singular forms the -ga present in the Gudanji accusative and oblique forms (and
presumably originally in Wambaya) appears before the comitative suffix:
   (4-289) Mawula g-a           irriga-yîli.

            He'll go with us.
128 Chapter 4    Interestingly, the comitative case form serves as the base for other case forms such as the
allative:
   (4-291) Yabu         ganza     irriga-yili-nmanji!
           take(FITC) SG.IMP.AWY 3PL.OBL-COMIT-ALL
           Take it to them!
   Possessive pronouns, like most nominals, have an ergative/absolutive case-marking
system; nominative and accusative case forms are homophonous. Table 4.19 lists the
nominative/accusative forms of the possessive pronouns, which agree in gender, number and
case with the noun that they modify (i.e. the possessed noun). A question mark following a
form indicates that the form has been inferred on the basis of other members of the paradigm,
but is not present in the corpus.

    The possessive pronouns are derived from the pronoun bases discussed above. With first
and second person singular, the forms for Classes I, II and III are formed by adding the
appropriate gender suffix: -0/-ni- `I ABS/NABS', -rna/-nga- `H ABS/NABS' and -ma/-mi- `III
ABS/NABS' respectively. The Class IV gender suffixes -gal-gi- `IV ABS/NABS' replace the final
vowel of the pronoun base. Third person singular masculine behaves in the same way as first
and second person singular. Third person singular feminine however, takes the Class I suffix
-ji (and-nyî- in the non-absolutive), and the Class H suffix -nga (both in the absolutive and
non-absolutive). The final nasal of the pronoun base becomes palatal before the palatal stop
of the Class I suffix and is dropped before the nasal of the Class II suffix.

2.1.4 LONG VOWELS AND VOWEL—SEMIVOWEL—VOWEL SEQUENCES
   Apart from in a few exceptional words such as Nganaara `Brunette Downs Station', long
vowels in Wambaya can generally be shown, at some stage of development, to be a reduction
of a vowel-semivowel-vowel sequence (where the two vowels are identical). Wambaya-
internal evidence for this can be the morphological structure (as in (a) and (b)), or the fact that
the two possibilities exist as alternatives (as in (c) and (d)).
24    Chapter 2
      (a) [manga,aiji]                         <    /manka+waji/      ear + PRIV (I)
      (b) ['c araggu,ulu]                      <    /darranggu+wulu/ tree + DU
      (c) [t'. ultJi], [t'p jtlt i]            <    /iriyiliji/       father
      (d) [baaij,bulu], r'balai3,bulul         <    /baraj+bulu/      old person + DU
   Other evidence comes from the fact that many words having a long vowel in Wambaya
contain a semivowel in Gudanji. Some examples (in the practical orthography) are:1 1
      Wambaya Gudanji Gloss
      ga'rnaa   'garnawa    long (IV)
      ngi'rnii  'ngirniwi   south
      ga'laa    'galawa     bone
      ga'rdaala 'garda,wala gidgee tree
   Stress patterns in Wambaya, however, distinguish two types of long vowels: phonetic and
phonemic. Phonemic long vowels are those which occur within morphemes and have no
alternative pronunciation in Wambaya. The examples such as garnaa and ngirnii above are
phonemic long vowels. Phonemic long vowels always receive primary stress irrespective of
their position in the word, as shown in the examples immediately above. The fact that these
long vowels can be seen to have derived originally from vowel-semivowel-vowel sequences
does not alter their synchronic status in Wambaya.12 Long vowels as in (a) to (d) above
however are phonetic long vowels, deriving from elision of a semivowel in a particular
context (see §2.3.2) and do not receive primary stress (unless, as in (d), they are in the first
syllable, which regularly receives primary stress anyway). For a discussion of the different
treatment of these two types of long vowels by Wambaya stress rules see §2.2.4.
   Other vowel-semivowel-vowel sequences can sometimes be heard as diphthongs (when
the second part of the sequence does not bear stress):
      /ayigurru/ `afternoon'         > fatguru]
      /barrawu/ `house'     > ['bar>aû]
      /mimayi/ `son-in-law' > ['mtmat]
  However, it is usually possible to demonstrate that these sequences are disyllabic and
phonemically contain a semivowel. With /barrawu/ and /mimayi/ this becomes clear once
morphological processes cause the second part of the phonetic diphthong to bear stress:
      /mimayirna/ `mother-in-law' > rmtma' ,juia]
      /barrawu+ni/ `house + LOC' > rbar>a ,wûni]
   With /ayigurru/ this is shown by the fact that the stress patterns for the word behave as if it
were four syllables, rather than three (which would be the case were there an initial
diphthong). In this example it is sufficient to use a phonemic representation:
      /ayigurru/ `afternoon' > 'ayi,gurru t Note that all of these examples involve the semivowel /w/. I have no examples which involve either of
    the other semivowels, In or /y/. The loss of /w/ in this environment in Wambaya may relate to the loss
    of intial /w/ before /a/. See §2.2.2 for examples of correspondences between /a/-initial words in
    Wambaya and /wa/-initial words in Gudanji and Binbinka.
12 Although it may be tempting to analyse these long vowel sequences as containing an underlying medial
    glide, this would not allow us to easily capture the generalisation that all these long vowels attract
    primary stress irrespective of their position in the word.
                                                                  Phonetics and phonology   25   For a discussion of the stress placement rules in Wambaya see §2.2.4. '
2.2 PHONOTACTICS
   All Wambaya words must contain a minimum of two syllables, can begin with either a
vowel or a consonant, and must end with a vowel (see below for a discussion of the auxiliary
which is the one exception to this). Although consonants (usually) cannot occur word-finally,
they can occur syllable-finally when they are the first element in a consonant cluster. There
are a few consonant-final nominal roots (involving /j/, /g/ and /ny/) and many of the verbal
stems are consonant-final, ending in either /n/, /rd/, Ir1/, Irr/, /j/, /ny/, /g/ or /ng/.
Biconsonantal clusters are common, but there are no vowel clusters.
  The auxiliary can be both consonant-final and monosyllabic. Examples of monosyllabic
auxiliaries include:
   (2-1)   Nyagajbi ngi.
           be.tired ISG.S(PR)
           I'm tired.
   (2-2) Gajbi ny-a.
           eat    2SG.A-PST
           You ate it.
    However, as a monosyllabic auxiliary must encliticise to the preceding word (see §2.2.4),
it is monosyllabic only from the grammatical point of view and does not constitute an
exception to the rule that all phonological words must be polysyllabic.
   That the auxiliary can be consonant-final, however, is an exception to the general
phonotactic constraints in Wambaya. The auxiliary can be consonant-final if it contains one of
the three consonant-final suffixes: -any (direction away, past tense), -amany (direction
towards, past tense), -n (progressive aspect). For example:
   (2-3)   Yarru g-any             manganymi-nka.
           go    3SG.S-PST.AWY tucker.IIl-DAT
           He went (to get) some tucker.
  (2-4)    Marlu-nnga ng-amany          yarru.
           far-ABL      I SG.S-PST.TWD go
           I came from a long way away.
  (2-5)    Mirra irrî-n             jamba-nî.
           sit    3PL.S(NP)-PROG ground.IV-LOC
           They're sitting on the ground.
In non-singular imperative constructions, and transitive imperative constructions with a first
person object, the auxiliary can again be consonant-final.
  (2-6)    Ngarl-wa gurl!
           talk-FUT DU.IMP
           You two talk!
26     Chapter 2
     (2-7)     Duga-j-ba            girr!
               sit.down-TH-FUT PL.IMP
               You lot sit down!
     (2-8)     Manganyma nyi-ng jiya-j-ba!
               tucker.III(ACC) 2SG.A- t 0 give-TH-FUT
               Give me (some) tucker!
   The full set of final consonants allowed in the auxiliary is: /rr/, /rU, /n/, /ny/, /ng/. Final
consonants are not allowed elsewhere in the language and will not be considered in the rest of
this discussion of word and syllable structure.","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"

table. This cluster is found in only one word and is highly unusual, not only in its
combination of consonants, but also in the fact that the cluster occurs initially in the syllable:
jrayijala `gooramurra' The phonotactic aberrance of this word suggests that it may have been
borrowed. This hypothesis is supported by the existence of the synonym marndardbarla,
which conforms with Wambaya's phonotactic constraints and may be the native Wambaya
word.

   As Table 2.3 above clearly demonstrates, consonant clusters in Wambaya are constrained
in a fairly systematic way. Except for the homorganic nasal—stop clusters, all of the
consonant clusters in Table 2.3 fall within a certain area of the chart: on the left hand side,
and particularly in the lower left-hand corner. It is exactly this sort of pattern that is predicted
by Hamilton's (1995) continuum (LABIAL DORSAL LAMINAL APICAL). According to this
continuum, labials followed by dorsals are the preferred onsets and apicals (followed by
laminais) are the preferred codas. The lower left hand corner of Table 2.3, where most of the
Wambaya consonant clusters fall, is that part of the table where apical codas (the first element
of the cluster) are coupled with labial and dorsal onsets (the second element of the cluster).
Furthermore, labial codas and apical onsets (both of which are least preferred according to the
continuum) occur only in homorganic nasal—stop clusters (which are excluded from
discussion by Hamilton).
   A second claim made by Hamilton, specifically directed at cluster phonotactics, is also
supported by the Wambaya data. According to Hamilton, the first consonant in a consonant
cluster must have a value further to the right on the continuum than the second consonant in.
order for the cluster to be licit.20 Thus, a cluster consisting of a dorsal followed by a labial is
well-formed (e.g. /gb/) while one consisting of a labial followed by a dorsal is not (e.g.
*/bg/)
   The consonant clusters in Wambaya conform exactly with this constraint: labials never
occur as the initial consonant in a cluster (as they are the leftmost member of the continuum),
dorsals are followed only by labials, laminais are followed by dorsals and labials, and apicals
are followed by all three (although there is only one instance of an apical followed by a
laminal: /mj/).
  Cross-cutting these cluster constraints based on active articulators are constraints based on
sonority values. Consonant clusters in Wambaya are well-formed only if the second20 Again, this is excluding homorganic nasal—stop clusters.
32    Chapter 2
consonant has a value that is lower than or equal to that of the first on the sonority hierarchy:
OBSTRUENT<NASAL<LIQUID<GLIDE.21 This explains, for example, why it is that nasal—stop
clusters are possible, but stop-nasal clusters are not. There are three exceptions to this
principle, all of which contain a liquid followed by a glide (glides are higher on the sonority
hierarchy than liquids). Thus /rrw/, /lw/, /rlw/ all contravene the above-mentioned principle
of relative sonority for consonant clusters.
   The principles governing well-formed consonant clusters in Wambaya can be formulated
as follows ((i)-(iv) are taken from the above discussion, (v)-(vii) are additional constraints
evident in Table 2.3):
  (i) All homorganic nasal—stop clusters are well-formed.
 (ii) The first member of a consonant cluster (excluding those in (i)) must be higher than the
      second member of the cluster on the following hierarchy (from Hamilton 1995):
      LABIAL<DORSAL<LAMINAL<APICAL (iii) Despite the possibilities predicted by (ii), a laminal can occur only as the second
       element of a cluster (excluding those in (i)) if it is preceded by a retroflex stop or nasal.
 (iv) The first member of a consonant cluster must have a value higher than or equal to the
      second member on the following sonority hierarchy (from Clements 1990):
      OB STRUENT<NASAL<LIQUID<GLIDE
 (v) As an exception to (iv), clusters containing a liquid followed by the glide /w/ are well-
     formed.
 (vi) A lateral can be the initial member in a consonant cluster only if it is followed by a
      peripheral stop or the glide /w/.
(vii) Neither /ly/, /y/ nor In can occur in a consonant cluster.
  These seven principles account for the well-formedness of all of the clusters contained in
Table 2.3 as well as the ill-formedness of those corresponding to empty cells. The only
exceptions to this are the cells containing question marks which possibly reflect accidental
gaps in the corpus.
   This discussion of consonant clusters has so far centred only on clusters containing two
consonants. However, there is one tri-consonantal cluster (/rrgb/) found in Wambaya. This
cluster is found only in a small number of Wambaya words (in a sample of over 1200 words
only 5 contain this tri-consonantal cluster intramorphemically). Examples of this cluster are:
      bunjurrgbarra      bend down (towards)
      burrgbanju         blow (on)
      lurrgbanyî         grab, abduct
      milîrrgbarna       blue tongue lizard
      gurrgbarra         stare
21 As given in Clements (1990). Note that the Wambaya pattern conforms with the Syllable Contact Law
    (Murray and Vennemann 1983) stated in Clements (1990:287) as follows:

   There are significantly fewer consonant clusters that are found across morpheme
boundaries in Wambaya than are found within morphemes, and there are none that are found
only intermorphemically. There are some very simple reasons for this. Firstly, the
phonotactic constraint that all words must end in a vowel means that a lot of stems are vowel-
final.

      jantba ground            jamba-nmanji          ground.Iv-ALL
   Secondly, although there are some consonant-final nominal and verbal roots which
function as stems for the addition of suffixes, in most examples in the corpus the final
consonant of the stem is either /j/, /g/, /ny/, /n/, /rd/, /ng/ or Id/ and the initial consonant of the
suffix is /b/ (or /w/ after liquids); all of the clusters are also found morpheme-internally:
      bungmaj- old man             bungmaj-bulu       old man-DU
      gulug-   sleep               gulug-baji         sleep-PRIV (I)
      jany-     dog                jany-bulu          dog-DU
      garran-  stand               garran-barda       stand-INF
      agard-    wash               agard-barli        wash-AGNT (I)

      ngarl-    talk               ngarl-waji         talk-PRN (I)
   And finally, Wambaya employs a number of devices to reduce or alter illicit consonant
clusters (i.e. those that do not conform to the well-formedness principles listed in §2.2.3.1)
that arise across morpheme boundaries; see §2.3.5.22
2.2.4 STRESS PLACEMENT
   The stress placement rules for Wambaya are similar to those for Warlpiri as reported in
Nash (1986). Stress placement in Wambaya is sensitive to morphological structure; each
polysyllabic morpheme constitutes a new domain for the placement of stress. Generally stress
falls on the first syllable of the stress domain and on each following alternate syllable, except
that the final syllable usually does not carry any stress. Stress placement is also sensitive to
syllable weight as heavy syllables (i.e. those containing a phonemic long vowel) are always
stressed whether they are in the first or second syllable of the stress domain (the only two
positional possibilities for long vowels). Therefore, with the exception of a handful of words
with a phonemic long vowel in their second syllable, primary stress falls on the first syllable
of the word.23
   Usually there is a one-to-one correspondence between a stress domain and a morpheme.
This is not the case for monosyllabic suffixes, however, which cannot constitute a stress
domain on their own. Monosyllabic suffixes either combine with a following monosyllabic
suffix to form a disyllabic stress domain or, if there is no following monosyllabic suffix, join
the stress domain of the root. (This is discussed in more detail below.) Monosyllabic roots,22   Note that the limited number of intermorphemic clusters is attributable to factors other than specific
     constraints on these clusters; it is possible that more research, and a larger corpus, would reveal other
     intermorphemic clusters.
23 In this respect I disagree with Chadwick (e.g. 1978:17) who claims that primary stress in all of the West
    Barkly languages falls on the penultimate syllable of the word.
34     Chapter 2
however, constitute a stress domain of their own. The auxiliary, although made up of more
than one morpheme (see Chapter 5), is only a stress domain of its own if it is polysyllabic.
When it is monosyllabic it must attach to the word to its left for the purposes of stress
placement:
       'bung.ma.nya ga > 'bung.ma. + ,nya. = ga old woman + II = 3SG.S.PST
  The examples in Table 2.4 demonstrate the interaction between stress placement and
morphological structure.
                          TABLE 2.4: EXAMPLES OF STRESS PLACEMENT        'bu.lyu.ngu      little.IV   > 'bu.lyu.,ngu + ma        little + u

        'j any.-         dog (ROOT) > 'jany. + ,bu.lu           dog + DU
   From a formal perspective, the stress placement rules in Wambaya can be described with
reference to foot structure and principles of metrical phonology.25 I will assume Nespor and
Vogel's (1986) definition of `the foot' (a higher level grouping of syllables below the
phonological word), which considers the foot to exist independently of stress placement, and
the construction of feet to precede rules of stress placement.
   The rules for constructing feet in Wambaya are given below, followed by some
explanation and exemplification of their use. These rules account for all the characteristics of
Wambaya stress placement mentioned above. As will be clear in the following foot-building
rules, feet in Wambaya are left-headed and are sensitive to morphological structure.26
     Wambaya rules of foot-formation:
(i)a. Moving from left to right, assign obligatory branching, left-headed binary feet to each
      morpheme. If a heavy syllable (i.e. one containing a phonemic long vowel) is
      morpheme-final, making a binary foot impossible, assign a strong degenerate foot.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"    The distribution of the future verbal suffix, which is found in imperative clauses and
positive future tense clauses, suggests that `future tense' may not be the best characterisation
of the function of this suffix. It is also not possible to treat it as a general irrealis mood suffix,
since it is not found in negative future tense clauses, nor in examples in which an irrealis
mood suffix appears on the auxiliary (see §5.2.4). The function of this suffix is complex and
still not fully understood and thus, in lieu of further research, I will refer to it as the `future
tense' suffix, while acknowledging the term's inadequacies. See Nordlinger (1996) for
further discussion.",[182]
"
4   Another interesting aspect of the apical contrast is that speakers are less likely to correct me with regani
    to these sounds than they are with regard to other contrasts in the language. Thus, unless the distinction
    is crucial in distinguishing one word from another, I have found that speakers will tend to accept my
    pronunciation of a word regardless of whether I have a retroflex or an apico-alveolar consonant. The
    reason for this could simply be the increased tolerance of imperfection that there is for beginners in the
    language, or it could reflect a more interesting fact about the phonology of the language and the
    relationship between these two series of consonants. Unfortunately there is little more that can be said
    given my limited data and research in this area. Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) notes that in literacy writers
    of many languages also appear to be more tolerant of non-representation, or misrepresentation of
    retroflexion that of other contrasts, particularly when it is marked by means of a diacritic.
5   Butcher's (to appear) instrumental analysis of the pronunciation of initial apicals by speakers of a
    number of different Australian languages yields some interesting results. While his study supports the
    generally held acoustic impression that the two apical series are neutralised in initial position, he found
    that the apical sound which does occur is neither the apico-alveolar nor the retroflex version. Rather, he
    found that the phonetic realisation of the initial apicals is of a 'Mittelding' type — having an articulation
    somewhere between the unneutralised articulation of the two series (p.13). Thus, he found that initial
    apicals tended to be non-retroflex but have an articulation further back than the alveolar ridge, ""often on
    the borderline between alveolar and postalveolar zones"" (p.13). It is quite possible that this is also the
    case in Wambaya. However, without a detailed instrumental analysis it is impossible to tell.

   The distinction between the two apical nasals /n/ and Irn/ is neutralised before the retroflex
stop /rd/. In this environment it is always the retroflex nasal which is found. The distinction
between In/ and the lamino-palatal nasal /ny/ is similarly neutralised before the lamino-palatal
stop; in this position it is usually /ny/ that occurs. In contrast, the distinction between /n/ and
/ng/ is maintained before /g/. The one exception to this involves the dative suffix -nka which
can be heard as either [nga] or fugal .6
     The alveolar tap/trill /rr/ is usually a tap, but is a trill preconsonantally:

   The retroflex approximant Id, rather than being grouped with the alveolar tap/trill under the
feature `rhotic', as is a common analysis for many Australian languages (e.g. see Dixon
1980:144-145), is considered to form a natural class with the semivowels /y/ and /w/ (as
reflected in Table 2.1). This analysis was prompted by a similar analysis given by McGregor
(1988b) for Gooniyandi and other languages in the north-west of Australia and is supported
by the following phonetic and phonotactic evidence which shows In to pattern like /y/ and /w/
and unlike /rr/.
(i) /r/, like the other semivowels, can be the result of lenition of stops in reduplication or
    preceding or following /g/. Thus, /b/ can be realised as /w/; /j/ as /y/; and /rd/ (written d
    initially) as /r/. Some examples are:
        wugbardi > wugwardi    cook
        junmi    > junmi-yunmi cut
        daguma > dagu-ragu-ma hit
        bardgu   > bargu       fall
      See §2.3.1 for a discussion of lenition and §2.3.6 for a discussion of reduplication.
(ii) /r/, like /y/ and /w/, can be elided between two identical vowels, creating a long vowel:
        manka-waji > mankaajî            deaf
        iriyiliji  > iriiliji            father
        baraj-bulu > baaj-bulu           old person-DU
       See §2.1.4 for a discussion of long vowels.
(iii) /r/, like /y/ and /w/ but unlike /rr/, can never be the initial element in a consonant cluster.
       See §2.2.3 for a discussion of consonant clusters.
   McGregor argues that in Gooniyandi the alveolar tap /rr/ forms a natural class with the
laterals, defined by the feature [liquid] (although distinguished by the feature [lateral])
(1988b:166, 169-171). There is some evidence to suggest that this may also be a possible
analysis for Wambaya:6      Hale (1959:i) gives -nka as the Wambaya dative suffix, and -ngga as the Gudanji version. In my corpus.
       the two appear as variants of each other, without any obvious dialectal difference.
                                                                            Phonetics and phonology       21(i) /rr/, /rl/ and /1/ behave as a class, being the only sounds that can precede /w/ in a
    consonant cluster (the other lateral /ly/ does not occur in consonant clusters).
(ii) /rl/ and /rr/ are similar in that they both appear to condition lenition from /b/ to /w/ in the
     verbal unmarked suffix -bî and the infinitive suffix -barda. See §6.1 for a discussion of
     verbal inflection.
      garran-bi      stand    BUT          ngîrr-wî          growl
      ngaj-barda     see-INF BUT           ngarl-warda       talk-INF
    Note that there are no verb roots that end with either of the other laterals: /1/ or Ay/.
   However, these two arguments alone are not adequately convincing to support postulating
a natural class containing the laterals and Irr/. Thus, I assume that /rr/ is in a class of its own,
defined as a non-nasal, non-lateral sonorant.7
2.1.2 VOWELS
   There is quite a wide range of allophonic variation among the three vowels in Wambaya.8
The major vowel allophones tend to be slightly central and become more so in unstressed
syllables. Vowels are fronted before palatal consonants and are often lowered or produced
with a more back articulation when next to the labio-velar approximant /w/. The various
allophones for each vowel phoneme and their environments are listed below:
      /a/ has the allophone [œ] I [j, p]_[j] e.g. /jayili/ `down': rj ejtli]
                                [ai] /_[J, p, X, j] e.g. /danya/ `clothes': Cdaina]
                                [>al / [w]_[m] e.g. /wamba/ `snappy gum': ['w>amba]9
                                /_[w]                  e.g. /barrawu/ `house': ['bar>awù]
                                [a] elsewhere          e.g. /baba/ `elder brother': ['baba]
7   Gavan Breen (pers.comm.) claims that /rr/ is in fact closely related to Id/ (McGregor I988b also provides
    evidence for a (historical) relationship between /d/ and /rr/ in other languages of northern Australia).
    Breen points out that /rr/ and /d/ contrast only in Wambaya when they occur intervocalically after a
    primary stressed vowel (and perhaps also as the initial member of a consonant cluster), but elsewhere
    seem to be in complementary distribution. Thus, /d/ is found word-initially and as the second member of
    a consonant cluster, while /rr/ occurs intervocalically after a non-primary stressed vowel. Although there
    are a few exceptions to this distribution, most of them can be attributed to factors such as dissimilation
    and morphological structure. However, as distributional evidence is not enough to he indicative of a
    natural class (Juliette Blevins, pers.comm.), this does not affect my treatment of /rr/ discussed above.
8   The long vowels /aa/ and /ii/ are very unusual and are exemplified below and then discussed in more
    detail in §2.1.4.
    In the language name, the phonetic realisation of the first /a/ is closer to [a I than [>a l:
        /wambaya/ 'Wambaya' ['womba'jal
22    Chapter 2
      Ii/ has the allophone [i] / _ [j], # e.g. /niyinama/ `female skin name': [ni jtnama]
                                                      e.g. /ngajbi/ `see': rr)aijbi]
                                   [>i] I_ [w]    e.g. /maliwa/ `big' (Iv): ['mal>iwa]
                                   [t] elsewhere e.g. /ngijini/ `yesterday' : rtjttt.ni]10
      /u/ has the allophone [u'] / [j, j, p, X] e.g./lujuluju/ 'coolamon': r'luiju'luiju]
                                                           e.g. /guyala/ `nothing': [1kuijala]
                                   [û] / [w] _             e.g. /mawula/ `play': r'm>awûla]
                                   [u] elsewhere           eg /jugu/ `MB' : rjugu]
   Vowels can also be slightly rhoticised before a retroflex consonant. This is especially true
of the low central vowel /a/.
   In a small number of words a long vowel [a:] is found, and a couple of words have the
long vowel [i:]. Such long vowels always carry primary stress. There are no examples of
minimal pairs in which these long vowels contrast with the corresponding short vowels.
These vowels are written aa and iî respectively. Some examples are:
      jaabi          Cja:bi]      wart
      bruraala       [ba'ra:la] bird sp.
      Nganaara       [ija'na:ra] Brunette Downs Station
      ngirnîî        [genii]      south
      burriiji       [bu'ri:3i] bird sp.
   The small number of examples of these vowels, and the absence of minimal pairs in which
they contrast with the corresponding short vowels, suggests that they are not an original part
of the Wambaya phonemic system. These vowels may have derived from an original
sequence of vowel—semivowel—vowel, from which the semivowel was dropped (in fact this
is known to be the case for ngirnii; see below). These vowels are discussed further in §2.1.4.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"
1.2.3 SOCIAL ORGANISATION
1.2.3.1 THE SUBSECTION SYSTEM
   Wambaya society is divided into a system of eight subsections, or `skins', according to
which marriage and all other relationships are determined. Brothers and sisters belong to the
same subsection, which is determined matrilineally. This system is demonstrated in Table 1.3
below. There are two sets of terms for most subsections; the less common term for each
subsection is given in parentheses. The difference between these two sets of terms is
discussed below. The subsections have different, although closely related, names for their
male and female members; in Table 1.3 female terms are given in bold. An equals sign
indicates a first-choice marriage partner, the outside arrows trace matrilineal descent, and the
broken lines in the centre show patrilineal descent. An alternative representation of this
system is given in Figure 1.1.",[27]
"   Note that guyala functions both as an interjection meaning `no, nothing' and as a particle
negating a clause, as in guyala nguda yarru `I didn't go'. This is the only other exception to
the mutually exclusivity of word class membership. Interestingly Evans (1995a:87) gives
warirra `nothing' as the only Kayardild word that may belong to more than one word class,
serving both as a nominal and an interjection.' 1
3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
3.2.1 CORE FUNCTIONS, ADJUNCTS AND COMPLEMENTS
  Grammatical relations (or grammatical functions), such as subject, object, indirect object,
complement and adjunct, are important in describing many syntactic and morphological
10 Note that the auxiliary is essentially a bundle of clitics. However, its special status in Wambaya
      grammar warrants its treatment as a distinct part of speech.
1 l Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) points out that the possible use of guyala as an interjection does not
      necessarily justify the claim that it belongs to more than one word class since it is not uncommon in
      languages for words of other classes to be used as complete utterances of their own, as in the use of
       `Man!' in English, for example. However, the two uses of guyala have different characteristics — as a
      particle, for example, guyala must co-occur with counter-factual mood marking in the auxiliary (see
       §7.6.I.1)— and thus are considered members of different word classes here.
54    Chapter 3processes in Wambaya. While these functions all have close associations with semantic roles,
the semantic roles are not necessarily invariant; a particular grammatical function may have
one semantic role with one verb, and a different semantic role with another. The role of
grammatical functions, therefore, is to provide the link between the surface morphological
and/or syntactic structure and the semantic level at which lexical predicates select arguments
with specific semantic roles (Bresnan 1982:288).
   Distinctions can be made within the grammatical functions according to two main
parameters: whether or not the function is subcategorisable by a verb, and whether the
function is semantically restricted, or semantically unrestricted.12 The criterion of sub-
categorisability separates adjuncts from other types of grammatical relations. Adjuncts are
never subcategorised for and can potentially occur with any verb. Adjuncts are semantically
transparent in that an adjunct's meaning is consistent and predictable and is not affected by
the verb with which it may occur.
   Among the subcategorisable functions, namely subject, object, indirect object and
complements, a distinction can be made according to whether or not the function is
semantically restricted (i.e. is only ever linked to an argument having a particular semantic
role) or semantically unrestricted (i.e. can be linked to any type of argument) (Bresnan
1982:293-294). Thus we can distinguish core functions (subject, object, indirect object) from
complements on this basis.13 Core functions are always subcategorisable and are
semantically unrestricted in that their meaning (i.e. their semantic role) is dependent upon the
verb of which they are an argument. Thus, the subject of one verb may have the semantic role
of agent, but that of another may be a perceiver or an undergoer. Similarly semantic roles
such as patient, perceived entity and location may all be paired with the grammatical function
of object subcategorised for by different verbs. Complements on the other hand, although
subcategorisable,14 are more closely linked with specific semantic roles and have a consistent
and predictable way of contributing to the meaning of the sentence (Andrews 1985:92).
Complements, therefore, form the middle ground so to speak, between semantically
transparent and non-subcategorisable adjuncts on the one end and semantically non-
transparent and subcategorisable core functions on the other.
   Some examples and a brief discussion of the types of complements and adjuncts found in
Wambaya follow. As the core functions are always subcategorised for, and are directly
related to, the verb of which they are an argument, they are discussed in §7.2, which deals
with the syntax of simple verbal clauses, and verb argument structures.
   Complements have invariant meanings which are related to, and easily characterised in
terms of, their case marking. Yet, unlike adjuncts, they can combine with only certain verbs,
and would therefore be part of a full dictionary entry for their governing verb. A verb such as
12 This terminology and the system of classification of grammatical relations is taken from Bresnan
    (1982:287).
13 Note that I use the term `indirect object' to refer to a type of object that is marked with an oblique case
    (usually dative). This is in contrast to what I simply refer to as `objects', which are marked with
    accusative case. Bresnan (1982) does not make such a distinction; in Bresnan's classification, these are
    both a type of object.
14 Note that there is a slight difference here in the use of the word `subcategorisable'. The sub-
    categorisability of complements is different from that of core functions in that core functions are
    generally obligatory (i.e. a transitive verb has an obligatory subject and object) while complements are
    more often optional (i.e. a verb of motion can have an optional ablative or allative complement
    indicating the source or the direction of the motion).
                                                                 Parts of speech and other preliminaries   55junmi `cut' can take a complement indicating the instrument used (example (3-17)); and
motion verbs such as bardgu `fall' and yarru `go' can take a complement in the allative case
(3-18) or the ablati ve case (3-19) denoting the direction or source of the movement.

   Some verbs subcategorise for . `subject complements' — secondary predicates sub-
categorised for by the verb and agreeing in case, number and gender with the subject. An
example of this is the verb manku in its sense 'to feel', which subcategorises for a reflexive
object and a subject complement denoting the state of affairs of the subject:
     (3-20) Manku ngî-ngg-a baginga.
            feel      I SGA-RR-NF bad.II(NOM)
            I feel no good.
   Similarly, perception verbs can subcategorise for what could be considered an `object.
complement' — a secondary predicate which modifies the object, denoting the state in which
the object is perceived:15

   Like complements, adjuncts have consistent meanings which remain unaffected by the
nature of the verb with which they occur. However; unlike complements, adjuncts are not
selected by verbs and can potentially co-occur with any type of verb in a clause. Typical
examples of adjuncts include locative phrases (example (3-22)), temporal phrases (3-23),
benefactive dative phrases (3-24) and secondary predicates (3-25).

5.2.4.2 THE `HYPOTHETICAL' SUFFIX
  The `hypothetical' suffix -agba (glossed 'HYP') is used in a number of future tense
constructions all of which share the notion that the future event is possible, but not certain»
Examples include:
   (5-62)     Ngangirna               banjirna,          mardima yunumarrga ngîyi-ng-agba
              2SG.POSS.II(NOM) cousin.II(NOM) chase              this.way    3SG.NM.A-I0-HYP
              mirnda            gajigajirra.
              1DU.INC.ACC quickly
              Your cousin might join us soon (lit. might follow us this way soon).
   (5-63)     Angbardî irr-agba barrawu            ngirra,      yarru ngirr-iba.
              build   3PL.A-HYP house.IV(ACC) IPL.EXC.OBL go           IPL.EXC.S NP.AWY
              They might build a house for us, (then) we'll go.
   The hypothetical suffix is the future tense counterpart of the non-actual suffixes in negative
clauses, co-occuring with the negative particles guyala and yangula in negative future tense
constructions:16
13 This is the analysis implicit in Hale's description (1959:ií) and suggested by Jane Simpson (pers.
     comm.).
14 As pointed out by Jane Simpson (pers. comm.), the fact that -u is used in polite imperatives may be
     further support for its general irrealis function: irrealis is often used for politeness, as demonstrated by
     the Aboriginal English ""You might do X for me"" or ""Might be we do X"".
15 In Chadwick (1978) and Nordlinger (1993a), this suffix is considered to he a future tense irrealis suffix.
     However, it is not clear how an future tense irrealis suffix would differ from the simple future tense
     suffix — all future tense constructions being, by definition, irrealis — and thus the analysis given here is
     preferred.
16 Note that this is slightly different from the non-actual suffixes, which are found in negative constructions
     containing the negative particle guyala only; they do not co-occur with the negative particle yanRula. For
     a more detailed discussion of negation see §7.6.
                                                                           The auxiliary   151  (5-64)   Guyala irr-agba yarru.
           NEG    3PL.S-HYP go
           They won't go.
  (5-65)    Yangula gin-agha            guriny-mi mîlama.
           NEG        3SG.M.A-HYP good-FAC again
           He won't be able to fix it again.
   While the large majority of negative future tense constructions contain the hypothetical
suffix, there are a few examples in which the negative particle yangula appears with the
simple future tense suffix -u (example (5-66)). See §7.6 for a more detailed discussion of
negation.
  (5-66)    Yangula ngu-ny-u            daguma.
           NEG        1SG.A-20-FUT hit
            I'm not going to hit you.
  Another main function of the hypothetical suffix is in admonitive constructions, which
warn of a possible danger (examples (5$7) and (5-68)).
  (5-67)   Alyu       lingba j-ba! Ginganbi ny-agba!
           NEG.IMP bogey-TH-FUT drown       2SG.S-HYP
           Don't swim! You might drown!
  (5-68)   Narunguji-ni ngiyi-ny-agba nawu.
           car.IV-LOC    3SG.M.A-20-HYP step.on
           A car might run you over. (lit. A car might step on you.)
The following example combines the negative and admonitive functions:
  (5-69)   Yangula gunu-ng-agba yagu. Gurda ngî-ngg-agba banjanganî
           NEG     3SG.M.A-10-HYP leave be.sick 1SG.A-RR-HYP behind
           nanga.
           3SG.M.OBL
           He won't leave me. (He's worried) I might get sick behind him.","[168, 169]"

1.2 ITS SPEAKERS
1.2.1 HISTORY
   The West Barkly communities have suffered greatly since European settlement, losing
virtually all their traditional land to white pastoralists well over a century ago. Survival by
II   This looks suspiciously like Gurindji, but he claims that the country belonging to these people lies to
     the east of Powell Creek in the Northern Territory.
I2   Actually, although called Wambaya, the forms of the auxiliary, the negative particles and many of the
     lexical items contained in these field notes suggest that the dialect Hale recorded is one closer to Gudanji
     than Wambaya.
                                                                       The language and its speakershunting and food-gathering was replaced by subsistence primarily on station rations, given in
return for work. All the older people that I have worked with, and many of the younger
people, have spent a significant amount of time employed on cattle stations; the men as
stockmen and the women as housemaids and the like.
   Little has been written that gives much information about the history of these communities.
The references to them found in the literature are brief and usually mention only their
location.13 A typical mention is found in Basedow (1907:3):
        The Binbinga, a peaceful tribe, occupies the McArthur River district for 40 miles
      south of Borroloola.
        The Godangee (probably a branch of the Gnanji), adjoins the Binbinga on the
      east.
        The Yumpia (Umbaia) lives in country extending south of the Binbinga, to the
      tablelands. Both this tribe and the former are noted for cattle-killing.
        The Angee and Anga (no doubt branches of the Nganji [sic]) are small, hostile
      tribes, living south and west of the Allaua, at the head of the Wickham River.
   Thus, most of the information for the following discussion has come from the Wambaya
and Gudanji people that I have worked with, and cannot be supported by information from
other sources.
   Most of the Wambaya and Gudanji people14 moved off the stations on their land during
the 1960s and 1970s. The reason for this, as explained to me by the people themselves,, is
that they were forceably moved off the stations by Welfare, who felt that the stations could
not provide enough food and health care to support the communities. However, this may not
have been the only reason as the movement off the stations appears to coincide with the
granting of award (equal) wages and citizenship in 1967, which resulted in the forcible
removal of Aboriginal residents from stations to towns in many regions of northern
Australia.15 The majority of these people moved into the towns of Elliott, Tennant Creek and
Borroloola.l 6
   This shift into country belonging to other people, and the subsequent split-up of their
communities, had disastrous effects for the Wambaya and Gudanji people, significantly
contributing to the loss of their language and much of their ceremonial life. While living on
`foreign' land they could not practise much of their ceremony and had to use languages such
as Kriol to communicate with the other communities, thereby reducing the use of their own
languages. John Avery's (1990:5) impression of the circumstances of these communities
during the mid 1970s is that they ""stood at the end of every queue, whether it was for town.
employment, housing or other such benefits, an d they were dependent on other Aboriginal
people for their participation in ceremonial life"". My impression is that, at least with respect to
the latter point, the current situation is only slightly better than it was at the time of this
observation.","[24, 25]"

1.1.1 THE WEST BARKLY LANGUAGES
   The West Barkly language family consists of 5 languages/dialects: Jingili, Ngarnga (or
Ngarnji), Wambaya, Gudanji and Binbinka. The structure of this family can be represented
as in Table 1.1 (following Chadwick 1978:2).
                      TABLE 1.1: THE WEST BARKLY LANGUAGE FAMILY                    West Barkly Language Family
                             Jingili        Eastern Groups
                                            Ngarnga        McArthur Language
                                                Wambaya Gudanji Binbinka
3   Although the Tangkic languages were originally classified by O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966) as
    Pama-Nyungan, recent discussions (namely Evans (1985, 1988, 1995a) and Blake (1988, 1990)) have
    shown them to be clearly non-Pama-Nyungan.
4
    These gender suffixes are then followed by the appropriate case suffix.
5
    The terms 'Eastern Group' and 'McArthur' are taken from Chadwick (e.g. 1978).
                                                                             The language and its speakers     3   Thus, the language family contains two groups: Jingili an d the Eastern Group. The
Eastern Group contains four languages/dialects of which three — Wambaya, Gudanji and
Binbinka — are clearly dialects of the one language. Lexicostatistical data (discussed below)
show Ngarnga to be quite closely related to these three dialects, but different enough to be
probably best considered a language of its own.6 Thus, the Eastern Group is made up of two
languages: Ngamga and the `McArthur language'7 which has the three dialects Wambaya,
Gudanji and Binbinka.
    Chadwick (1978:320, 322) provides a lexicostatistical comparison of the members of the
West Barkly language group based on a 100-item word list. His results are given in Table 1.2
(I have collapsed his two tables into one).
                TABLE 1.2: LEXICOSTATISTICAL COMPARSION OF WEST BARKLY
                        LANGUAGES (BASED ON 100-ITEM WORD LIST)                                   Jingili      Ngarnga       Wambaya          Gudanji
                   Binbinka         21%           61%           69%             88%
                   Gudanji          21%           62%           78%
                   Wambaya          29%           60%
                   Ngamga           28%
   Thus, Jingili has a fairly low level of shared vocabulary with all of the Eastern Group
languages/dialects and is quite clearly a language of a different subgroup. On the other hand,
the languages/dialects of the Eastern Group have quite high levels of shared vocabulary,
although the dialects of the McArthur language share more vocabulary with each other
(between 69% and 88%) than any of them do with Ngarnga (between 60% and 62%).
However, the levels of shared vocabulary with Ngarnga are still substantial and suggest a
close relationship with the dialects of the McArthur language. The three dialects of the
McArthur language form a dialect chain: Wambaya shares a high percentage of vocabulary
with Gudanji which shares a high percentage of vocabulary with Binbinka. The percentage of
shared vocabulary between Wambaya and Binbinka, however, is significantly less. This
pattern is predictable from the (traditional) geographic positions of the three communities:
Wambaya country shares its northern border with Gudanji country which shares its northern
border with Binbinka country (see Map 2).
   The main focus of this description is the Wambaya dialect of the McArthur language.
Unfortunately it was not possible to investigate the other Eastern Group languages/dialects in
the sane amount of detail that I have for Wambaya. This is due not only to time constraints
but also to difficulty in finding informants: I have only been able to find one speaker of
Ngarnga and only one partial speaker of Binbinka. However, what information I have on
these other languages (particularly Gudanji, smatterings of which are found in the speech of
6   There has been a fair amount of variation in the literature as to the classification of Ngarnga with respect
    to the other West Barkly languages. Capell (1979:182) considers it to be very close to Jingili, related
    ~practically at dialect level"". Tindale (1974), on the other hand, gives `Ngandji' (Ngarnji/Ngarnga) as an
    alternati ve name for the `Kotandji' (Gudanji) people, thereby suggesting that Ngarnga is very closely
    related to dialects of the McArthur language. Chadwick (1971:34) describes Ngarnga as ""a `halfway' in
    linguistic content between Djingili in the west and the Wambaja-Gudandj.i group in the east..."" which is
    a more accurate claim although, as shown in Table 1.1, Ngamga is closer in relationship to the
    McArthur dialects than it is to Jingili.
7   Note that this language exists only for the purposes of linguistic classification and has no traditional
    status.

most Wambaya speakers) is included in the discussion wherever possible.8 A discussion of
Jingili is outside the scope of this work as it is substantially different from the other
languages and is also the language which Chadwick has worked on in the most detail (see
Chadwick 1975). Jingili will be referred to only for comparative discussion.","[20, 21, 22]"
"
4.4.11 PROPRIETIVE SUFFIX
    The proprietive suffix is used to indicate that one noun `has' another. Its use in Wambaya
is rather restricted and, although it is occasionally used to indicate alienable possession (as in
`I have a spear'), it is most frequently used to indicate the physical characteristics of a person
(e.g. `She is pregnant'), an object (e.g. `tea with milk') or a place (e.g. `place with trees').
a) Form
   The proprietive suffix agrees in gender with the noun that it modifies:
   (4-155) alajî          darranggu-nguji
            boy.I(NOM) stick-PROP.I(NOM)
            a boy with (a) stick
   (4-156) alanga         darranggu-ngunya
           girl.II(NOM) stick-PROP.II(NOM)
           a girl with (a) stick
   (4-157) maga              darranggu-nguja
            camp.IV(NOM) tree-PROP.IV(NOM)
            a camp with trees
   The absolutive and non-absolutive forms for each gender are given in Table 4.10. The
gender marking with the proprietive suffix is regular for nominals (see §4.2.2) and the
different gender forms are all derivable from the root -nguj-. A noun with the proprietive
suffix must also agree with the case (example (4-158)) and number (4-159) of the noun or
referent that it modifies.
                                                                                       Nominals     95               TABLE 4.10: THE GENDER FORMS OF THE PROPRIETIVE SUFFIX                                    Absolutive form       Non-Absolutive form
                     Class I           -nguji                -ngunyi-
                     Class II          -ngunya               -ngunya-
                     Class III         -ngunyma              -ngunymi- (?)
                     Class IV          -nguja                 nguji-
   Number suffixes are added to the root, -nguj-. The proprietive suffix takes the -baia plural
suffix (see §4.3.3.1).
   Some examples of the proprietive suffix co-occuring with other suffixes are:
  (4-158) Wurrudbanyi ngiy-a                    maganja                   murlu-ngunya-ni.
            pull              3SG.NM.A-PST digging.stick.1V(ACC) eye-PROP.II-LOC
            The one that could see got the yam stick.
   (4-159) Nanawulu              nayîda-wulu         gijîlulu-nguj-bulu.
            this.H.DUNOM woman-DU(NOM) money-PROP-DU(NOM)
            These two women have money.
   (4-160) Ngirriyani            manganyma-nguj-balarna.
            I PL.EXC.NOM tucker.HI-PROP-PL.II(NOM)
            We've got tucker.
  There is some inconsistency in the corpus as to the form of the noun to which the
proprietive suffix is affixed. The usual case is simply to add it to the full citation form of the
noun (including the gender suffix). Thus:
   (4-161) manganyma-nguja
            tucker. II-PROP.IV (NOM)
           tucker-having (Iv)
   (4-162) janjî-ngunya33
            dog.I-PROP.II(NOM)
            dog-having (II)
   However, in other examples it seems that the proprietive suffix is added to a nominal root.
In these examples the root ends in /g/ and the initial consonant of the suffix is omitted:
   (4-163) alag-unya                   (citation form of noun: alaji (I) or alanga (II))
           child-PROP.II(NOM)
           pregnant (1)
   (4-164) garlangg-uja                (citation form of noun: garlangga (IV))
             sand-PROP.IV(NOM)
             sand-having (IV)
  For some nouns either alternative is possible. For example, the proprietive form of
marnarrga `mud' (IV) (here with Class II agreement) was given in two different ways:33 It would be interesting to see whether this form would contrast with a form janya-ngunya `dog.tt-
    PROP.n(NOt )' , in which the dog is marked as female and not male. This is something that needs to be
    checked in the field.
96     Chapter 4
     (4-165) mamarrga-ngunya            AND     marnarrg-unya
             mud.IV-PROP.II(NOM)                mud-PROP.II(NOM)
   Similarly, there are two different ways in which the nouns iliga `sore' (Iv) and wawunjî
`sugarbag' (I) can be inflected with the proprietive suffix:
     (4-166) iliga-nguji                AND      ilig-uji
             sore.I V-PROP.I(NOM)                sore-PROP.I(NOM)
             sore-having (I)
     (4-167) wawunjî-nguja            AND        wawunyg-uja
             sugar.bag.I-PROP.IV(NOM)            sugar.bag-PROP.IV(NOM)
             sugar bag-having (IV)
   If a noun retains an overt gender suffix (example (4-161)) I will represent it in the
interlinear glosses. If there is no overt gender suffix, however, I will not represent the gender
of the `base' noun in the gloss. For example, janji-ngunya will be glossed `dog.I-PROP.II' but
darranggu-ngunya will just be glossed `stick-PROP.II'.
b) Function
   The most common use of the proprietive suffix is to express a physical characteristic or
state of a person (examples (4-168) and (4-169)), an object (4-170) and (4-71) or a place (4
172).
     (4-168) Ilarra-wulu:      gunyama        murlu-ngunya     gunyarna

     Another use of the proprietive suffix is to express alienable possession:

  (4-175) Bungmaji         iniyaga        g-uba     yarru balamurru-nguji.
          old.mani(NOM) that.I.SG.NOM 3SG.S-NP.AWY go(FUT) spear-PROP.I(NOM)
          That old man will go with a spear.
   Interestingly, some speakers restrict the proprietive suffix to having word scope, and
others use it with phrasal scope, marking the proprietive on all words of the NP. Thus, some
speakers (e.g. MH) considered the following examples to be perfectly grammatical (although
there are no such spontaneous examples in the corpus):
  (4-176) Alaji        buguwa-nguji      darranggu-nguji.
          boy.l(NOM) big.IV-PROP.I(NOM) stick-PROP.I(NOM)`
          The boy has a big stick.
   (4-177) Yarru ng-a         bayigi-ngunya ngarrirna-ngunya.
           go      1SG.S-PST bag-PROP.II(NOM) 1SG.POSS.II-PROP.II(NOM)
           I went (taking) my bag.
   However, one speaker in particular (MG) felt that they were completely ungrammatical and
that it was necessary to use a verbal clause instead, such as the following:34
   (4-178) Yabu gini-n                  buguwa        darranggu.
             have   3SG.M.A(PR)-PROG    big.IV(ACC)   stick.IV(ACC)
             He has a big stick.
   Note that Dench and Evans (1988) give phrasal scope as an essential characteristic of case
suffixes, as opposed to derivational suffixes. As the proprietive suffix can have phrasal scope
for some speakers it considered for present purposes to meet this criterion for casehood.
However, further investigation is required.","[112, 113, 114, 115]"
"  As mentioned above, speakers say that there is no difference in meaning between guyala
and yangula constructions and there are cases in which two sentences, one of each type of
negative construction, are said to have the same meaning. Thus:
  (7-164) Guyala ng-udî                    yarru.
             NEG        1SG.S-NACT.PR go
             I'm not going.
  (7-165) Yangula ng-u                 yarru.
             NEG          1SG.S-FUT go
             I'm not going.
   However, despite seemingly equivalent examples such as these, there does appear to be a
semantic difference between the two particles. While yangula seems to be more of a general,
unmarked negation marker, the use of guyala implies that there are external factors, beyond
the actor's control, that prevent (or at least, make unlikely) the execution of the act described
by the proposition.221 Thus, guyala appears to be a negative modal22 indicating
`impossibility' or `unlikelihood', similar to English `can't'. Yangula, on the other hand,
denotes simple propositional negation and is therefore unmarked; it can be used either in
situations in which guyala would be inappropriate (i.e. there are no external forces which
prevent the action from being carried out) or in situations where the existence or absence of
such forces is simply not relevant.23 Some examples illustrating this semantic difference
follow.
  (7-166) Guyala ng-uda                  gajbi manganyma.
             NEG        1 SG.A-NACT.PST eat      tucker.III(ACC)

    In Hale (1959), the gender suffi xes for Wambaya are given as: -0 — -(y)i `mase',. -ma 'fern', -ma
     'vegetable' and -(w)a `neuter'.
10 The one exception to this is the Class I non-absolutive suffix -ni- when it occurs with Class. I modifiers.
     In just this case the non-absolutive suffix is added to the absolutive form of the noun rather than
     replacing the absolutive suffix:
         gunv-i other-LABS > gunyi-ni- other-LNABS-

   As shown in Table 4.3, there are a number of different allomorphs for all genders except
Class In. As Classes I and II have the largest number of allomorphs, I will discuss them first,
and will then discuss the gender marking on Class Iv nouns.
   The most common Class II absolutive allomorphs and the common non-absolutive
allomorphs for both Classes I and II are all phonologically conditioned: the initial nasal of the
suffix assimilates to the place of articulation of the preceding consonant (i.e. the final
consonant of the root). Thus:11
       Class II absolutive: UR = -rna
        -ma > -nya \ j, ny
               > -nga \ g, ng
               > -ma elsewhere
       Class I non-absolutive: UR = -ni-
        -ni- > -nyi- \ j, ny
               > -ngi- \ g, ng
               > -ni- elsewhere
       Class II non-absolutive: UR = -nga-
        -nga- > -nya- \ j, ny
               > -nga- elsewhere
   This allomorphic variation is shown in the following examples in which the underlying
allomorphs are given between percentage signs.l 2

     -barli- AGNT                 -barli-0      barlini-    -barlima    -barlinga-
   This pattern of allomorphic alternation holds for most of the nominals and nominal
suffixes for which there is sufficient data in the corpus. However there are some nouns1 I Note that, interestingly, it is the Class t non-absolutive suffix -ni- which is used with foreign (i.e.
     English) words:
         Yaniyawulu narunguja-wulu             garage-ni-ni.
         that.IV.DU.NOM car.iV-DU(NOM) garage-I.NABs-Loc
         Those two cars are in the garage.
12 For a discussion of the morphophonemic processes by which the final consonant of the root is dropped
     or nasalised before the gender suffix see §2.3.
13 Nominal roots can often be indentified from the dual form of the nominal since the dual suffix is usually
     attached to the form minus the gender suffix: bungmaj-bulu, marndag-bulu, for example (see 4.3.2).
                                                                                 Nominals    67which have, for example, the Class II suffix -nya in their citation form, but for which it is
unknown whether the root ends in a palatal consonant (i.e. the root is not present in the
current corpus). An example of such a noun is gulangunya `blue-tongue lizard' (II). These
nouns do not contradict this analysis and so, for the present purposes, I assume them to be
consistent with it_ There are some Class H nouns that have the -nya absolutive suffix, but for
which it would seem (on the basis of the Class I counterpart) that the root does not have a
final palatal consonant, M of these examples are kinship nouns and, as there are other
examples of kinship nouns behaving differently with respect to gender marking (see below),
these are not considered to invalidate the rules of distribution of allomorphs outlined above.
Some examples of these nouns are:
      Class I                          Class II
      gugu-O   MMB                     gugunya         MM
      barnga-O male cross-cousin       barnganya       female cross-cousin
      ganggu-O FF                      ganggunya       FFZ   The Class I absolutive allomorphs are mostly phonologically conditioned also. Class I
nouns are inflected with jii after consonant-final roots and -( after vowel-final roots (see
bungmaji and abajabajî above). Class I modifiers and suffixes have -0 after roots ending in /i/
and usually have -i with other vowel-final roots, although there are a couple of adjectives that
are inflected with -yi. As with nouns, consonant-final adjectival roots are followed by the
gender suffix ji. Examples are:
     Root               Class I form   Gloss
     -barb         >     barlî-©       AGNT
     gurijbi-      >    gurijbi-O      good
     gunya-        >    gunyi          other
     munduru-      >    munduri        short, little
     gain-         >    gamayi         long

     garnguj-      >    gamgu ji       many
     bagig-        >    bagi-ji        bad
   Synchronically the three suffixes that appear with vowel final roots — -0, -1, -yi are
clearly distinct- However, there is evidence suggesting that the original system had a simple
opposition between ji after consonants and -yi after vowels (note that lenition of /j/ to /y/
between vowels is common in Wambaya — see §2.3.1), meaning that all three of the above
suffix derive from the original allomorph -yi. This evidence includes the following:
  (i) Almost all of the nouns and all of the modifiers and suffixes which take the absolutive
      suffix -0 end in Ti!. This suggests that there has been a coalescence of the original
      gender suffix -yi with the root such that the final vowel of the root and the initial
      semivowel of the suffix were elided, resulting in the fV-final modern-day forms that
      now have no overt absolutive gender suffix. Examples include:
     burrulyi        tadpole
     dirdibulyi      peewee
     marunki         male countryman
     ngarrinybi      male friend
     galyurringî     water
     wardangarrî     moon

      -barli           AGNT
      gurijbî          good
   The same could also be true of the modifiers and suffixes with other final vowels that now
take the gender suffix Ii/: the final vowel of the root an d the semivowel of the suffix elided in
the Class I form, leaving /i/ as the gender suffix.
 (ii) There are a few places in which the original form -yi has been preserved. The two
      adjectives garna- and buga- contain the suffix -yî in their Class I forms (see above), and
      POK preserves it in the Class I noun mardumbarra `saltwater crocodile', pronouncing it
      mardumbarrayi. There are also a couple of nouns, such as wagalatnarri `crow', which
      are given in Hale (1959:17) as having a final suffix -yi: wagalamarriyi.
   There are a few Class I and Class II gender suffixes which are found only with kinship
nouns. These are the Class I non-absolutive suffixes -rdi and -na, the Class II absolutive
suffix -rda , and the Class II non-absolutive suffix -ga.
   The two Class I non-absolutive suffixes -na and -rdi14 are found with masculine kinship
nouns that take the -0 absolutive suffix. The former of these, along with the Class II non-
absolutive suffix -ga to be discussed below, conditions the irregular ergative/locative suffix
-yi (see §4.4.3). As far as I can tell, there is no phonological conditioning of these two
allomorphs. The kinship nouns with which they are found in the corpus include the
following:
      Absolutive form Non-absolutive form Gloss
      jugu-0          juguna-             MB
      baba-0          babana-             elder brother

      ganggu-0        ganggurdi-          FF    Many Class II kinship nouns take the non-absolutive suffix -ga, which conditions the
irregular ergative/locative suffix -yi (see §4.4.3). Following is a list of the nouns taking this
suffix found in the present corpus.
      Absolutive form         Non-absolutive form Gloss
      gugunya                 guguga-                   MM

      irdinya                 îrdîga-                   FZ14 This suffix has also been heard with an apico-alveolar consonant: -di. Along with the -rda absolutive
    suffix found on some Class II kinship nouns (see below), it is presumably related to the widespread
    kinship affix *-rti discussed by Nash (1992).
                                                                                Nominals   69  The regular Class n absolutive suffix for kinship nouns is -nya (see above). However, a
few nouns have alternative forms in which the absolutive suffix is -rda:
      gugunya gugurda MM
      ngayijinya ngayijirda     FM
      gambaranya gambararda MZ
      jamînjilînya jamînjilirda MFZ
   The remaining few Class I and II gender suffixes are found on only one or two forms. The
Class I non-absolutive suffix -dî is found only with the noun yangaji `meat'. The Class II
absolutive suffixes -rra and -0 are found with nouns such as gujinganjarra `mother' and
nayida `woman', respectively. Nouns taking these absolutive suffixes take the non-absolutive
suffix -nga.
    The discussion so far has concentrated on Class I and Class II gender suffixes. The Class
III gender suffixes are straightforward as they are consistent on all members of the class, but
there is some variation in the gender suffixes for Class IV. For the large part, Class IV
nominals are not overtly marked in either the absolutive or the non-absolutive:
      Absolutive form Non-absolutive form Gloss
      darranggu-O     darranggu-0-        tree
      lagija-O        lagija-0-           coolaman
      gujarra-O        gujarra-0-         two
      -baja-0          -baja-0            PRIV
   There are a small number of Class ry nominals, however, which appear to have an overt
gender suffix -a, as shown by the fact that it is replaced in the non-absolutive form with the
suffix -i:
     Absolutive form Non-absolutive form Gloss
     mag-a            mag-i-             camp
     iligirr-a        iligirr-i-         river
  However, there is no synchronic evidence for the existence of mag- or iligirr- as a root.
For example, the dual suffix attaches to the absolutive form of the noun:
     maga-wulu camp-DU
     iligirra-wulu ri ver-DU
    The absolutive suffix -a is also present in the Class N noun burnariga `wild orange tree',
as shown by comparison with the Class in counterpart burnaringma `wild orange (fruit)', and
it is the Class N suffix used with /i/-final modifiers/suffixes:
     Root      Class ry form Gloss
     -barb- -barl-a          AGNT
     gayinî gayin-a          who/what
     gurijbi- gurzjb-a       good
   The other Class N absolutive gender suffixes: -ga, -ja and -wa, are found only on
modifiers and nominal suffixes. The palatal-initial allomorph -ja occurs with palatal-final
roots and the velar-initial allomorph -ga appears with roots ending with any other consonant:
     -guny-       PL     -ganja        PL.IV.ABS
     garnguj-     many . garngc ja     many.N.ABS

      bagig-       bad      bagiga     bad.IV.ABS
   In the non-absolutive case these suffixes become ji- and -gi- respectively.
   The Class Iv absolutive suffix -wa is found with only two adjectives: garnaxa 15
long.IV.ABS' and buguwa `big.IV.ABS'. These two adjectives are unusual in many respects:
they both take an irregular Class I absolutive suffix -yi (discussed above), the Class II form of
each of them is formed by adding the Class II suffix to the Class I form rather than to the root,
and the Class III form of each of them is formed by adding the Class III suffix to the Class IV
form, rather than to the root.
      Root    Gloss Class I Class H   Class III Class IV
      garna- long garnayî garnayirna garnawama garna(w)a
      buga-16 big   bugayî bugayirna buguwama buguwa
   For the purposes of clarity and simplicity, I will not segment the roots and gender suffi xes
in the examples in this description. Furthermore, I will not include the glosses `ABS' and
`NABS', since this information is clear from the form of the case marking (i.e. the non-
absolutive gender suffix appears only before a non-zero case suffix). Thus, the nominative
and ergative/locative forms of the noun bungmajî will be glossed as follows:
      bungmaji     old.man.I(NOM)
      bungmanyî-ni old.man.I-LOC
4.2.3 ODD AGREEMENT
  The usual case is for a Class I noun to require Class I agreement on a modifier, a Class II
noun to require Class II agreement, and so on. However, there are times when the gender of a
modifier does not agree with the gender of the noun that it modifies. Examples of this `odd
agreement' can be classified into two different types: `natural semantic agreement' and
`unmarked gender agreement'.
(i) Natural semantic agreement
    This is the less common of the two types of odd agreement. As the name implies, in this
type of agreement the gender of the modifier agrees with the natural semantic `gender' of the
noun (Class Iv), rather than the grammatical gender to which the noun belongs (Class I or
Class II). This agreement, although often found in people's casual speech, is rejected by
speakers as ungrammatical when repeated back to them.
   Two examples of this type of agreement involve the nouns wawunji `honey, sugarbag' (I)
and bayigina `bag' (II). These are inanimate nouns which belong to animate noun classes. In
the following examples a Class iv modifier occurs with these nouns, thus agreeing with the
inanimate semantics of the noun, rather than the animate grammatical gender.

   There are seven particles in the corpus: the negative particles guyala, yangula and alyu; the
negative interrogative wayi; the exclamative marker gubi and the conjunctions ngaha `THEN'
and gaji `LEST'.30 In addition there are three particles present in Hale's (1959) notes, but not
found in my corpus. These are the interrogative particle gayi and the conjunctions ngabayi
`admonitive' and marda `when'. The two interrogative particles and the three negative
particles were discussed above in §7.5 and §7.6 respectively. The other five particles are
discussed below_
7.7.2.1 GUB! 'EXCLAM'
   There are only a few examples of this particle in the corpus and so it is difficult to
determine its exact meaning. However, in the small number of examples in which it is found.",[225]

4.9 NP STRUCTURE
   A Wambaya noun phrase consists of a head and one or more modifiers, all of which are
optional (the head can be ellipsed when it is recoverable from previous discourse; see below).
All members of the NP must agree in terms of gender, number and case (where
morphologically possible). As is common to several Australian languages, elements of NPs in
Wambaya need not be contiguous in the clause. This possibility of discontinuous NP
constituents has led researchers working on some Australian languages (e.g. Heath 1986 on
Nunggubuyu, Blake 1983 on Kalkatungu) to suggest that these languages may not have NP
                                                                                                Nominals      131constituents, and that apparent NPS can just be treated as apposed nominals. I will not review
the arguments for this analysis here, but assume that the following two pieces of evidence
argue for the existence of a NP constituent in Wambaya, at least in those cases in which the
elements are contiguous (see below for more discussion of discontinuous NPs):
     (i) Usually the auxiliary must follow the initial word of a clause. However, it is possible
         for the auxiliary to follow a complex NP, thereby providing evidence for its existence
         as a constituent_ The position of the auxiliary can then be described as being after the
         initial constituent of a clause.
     (ii) In possessive phrases in which the possessor is marked with either genitive or dative
          case, relational case marking is found only on the head of the NP. As relational case
          marking is not found on the possessor nominal in this situation, the case marking
          found on the head nominal also refers to the modifying nominal, thereby providing
          evidence that the two nominals in such phrases form a single NP constituent.
   The structure of a Wambaya NP is as follows.78 Note that any one of the modifers listed in
the position before the head can be postposed to follow the head.79
       (MODIFIERS)                       (HEAD) (MODIFIER)
       (Dem)(POSS)(Num)(Adj) Nom
       Dem = Demonstrative
       POSS = Possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or possessive NP
       Num = Numeral
       Adj = Adjective
       Nom = Nominal
  The head is usually filled by a noun, but can in principle be any type of nominal. An
example from Text 1 in Appendix A in which a numeral functions as the head is:
     (4-301) Garnguji=miji                in-i-n                mirra.
               many.I(NOM~INFER 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sit
               There must be a big group (of people).
   The fact that this example occurs at the beginning of the text (i.e. the second line) before
there has been any mention of people, suggests that the numeral is functioning as the head,
rather than simply modifying an ellipsed head. However, there are a small number of
examples in which it may be argued that the head has been ellipsed. Consider the following
sequence (lines 62-64) from the same text:S0
78    This is the same structure as in Kayardild (Evans 1995a) and is very similar to the Gooniyandi structure
      (McGregor 19%).
79    In his detailed discussion of Gooniyandi noun phrases, McGregor (1990) makes a distinction between
      reference modification and referent modification, and shows that this distinction correlates with a contrast
      in function between pre-head and post-head modifiers. Thus, an element which precedes the head modifies
      the reference of the head nominal, it selects a subset of the potential referents denoted by the nominal. In
      contrast. a post-head constituent modifies the head's referent, indicating a quality of property of the thing
      itself, which may be independent of the nominal denoting the entity (p. 26711). Further research is needed
      to determine whether there is likewise a semantic difference between pre- and post- head modifiers in
      Wambaya.
80    This discussion has benefited greatly from McGregor's (1990) discussion of NPs in Gooniyandi,
132   Chapter4   (4-302) Bungmaj-buli-ji     ngankawuliji wurl-aji               daguma juwarramba.

            many.i(ACC) 3DU.A-HAB.PST hit
            They'd been killing a lot of them.
  In this example, in contrast to that given in (4-301), garnguji in the final line appears to be
modifying the ellipsed head juwarramba which is mentioned in the preceding two clauses.
Thus, this is one example in which an NP has no overt constituent corresponding to its head.
   A NP can also be made up of a pronoun. A (non-possessive) pronoun is always the head
of a phrase, and usually occurs alone (although see below for some possible exceptions to
this).
   Some example NPs are:

   Although the tendency is for NPs to be contiguous, it is possible for members of a NP to be
separated in the clause. In the majority of these examples, one element of the discontinuous
NP appears initially in the clause (see examples (4-312)-(4-314)), but this is not always the
case (see (4-315)).
  Examples of discontinuous NPs are:
  (4-312) Garngunya gin-aji                yabu garirda-rdarra       garndawugini-ni.
          manylRACC) 3SG.M.A-HAB.PST have wife.Il-GROUP(ACC) one.i-LOC

           Sister you're making lots of dust for us.
   A great deal more work is needed on discontinuous constituents in Wambaya and the
discourse conditions under which they are possible.                    .
  A small set of nouns can also be used as modifiers, modifying a head noun. The most
common examples of this involve the noun bungmajî `old man' (1):
   (4-316) Garidi-ni      bungmanyi-ni gin-amany     yanybi.
           husband.I-LOC old.man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-P.TWD get

           mawula-ji-nka.
           play-TH-DAT
           My old man uncle came to play (cards).
134     Chapter 4   Another example involves the noun lagurra `hole'. Note that despite the fact that it belongs
to a different gender, lagurra shows no gender agreement with the head noun in this example:
     (4-318) Yabu ng-aji             lagurra        juruma.
             have 1SG.A-HAB.PST hole.IV(ACC) stomach.IIl(ACC)
             I used to have a deep stomach (i.e. I was very thin).
   In a couple of examples an oblique pronoun co-occurs with a noun. In these examples it is
difficult to determine whether the two belong to one NP or to different NPs. However, the fact
that pronouns usually occur alone in a NP, and that there is usually (but not always) a pause
between the pronoun and the noun, suggests that it may be better to treat these examples as
containing two apposed NPs, as in the English translations.
     (4-319) Yandu irrî          ngaya     bulungunga-nka.
             wait   3PL.S(NP) 3SG.F.OBL young.woman.II-DAT
             They wait for her, the young woman.
     (4-320) Yangula g-a         yarru naniyaga          mujuju-ngunya
             NEG       3SG.S-PST go     that.II.SG.NOM menstruation-PROP.II(NOM)
             irrîga-yîli-nmanji juwa-nmanji.
             3PL.OBL-COMIT-ALL man.I-ALL
             That menstruating woman can't go near them, the men.
   However, in at least one example in the corpus, a pronoun appears between a modifier and
a noun, making the apposition analysis harder to justify:
     (4-321) Jawaranya          ng-u        yidanyî ngaba ng-u               yardi
             billycan.II(ACC) ISG.A-FUT get          THEN      1SG.A-FUT put
             yaniya           cool drink nînaka            nanga         juglni-nka.
             that.IV.SG.ACC cool drink this.I.SG.DAT 3SG.M.OBL boy.t-DAT
             I'm going to get the billycan and put that cold drink (in it) for this boy.
   Further investigation is required. In particular, it is necessary to test whether a pronoun +
noun combination can appear before the auxiliary before it can be determined whether they
can together make up a single NP.
INALIENABLE POSSESSION
   As mentioned in §4.8, Wambaya makes a formal distinction between two types of
possessive constructions: alienable and inalienable. In constructions of alienable possession
the possessor is expressed by either a possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or by a nominal
inflected with either the dative or genitive case. In constructions of inalienable possession,
however, there is no special marking on the possessor nominal and the two nominals occur in
juxtaposition. Examples of constructions of alienable possession are found in §4.8. §4.6.
§4.4.4 and §4.4.10. A discussion of inalienable possession follows.
   Constructions of inalienable possession are the most common type of what are commonly
referred to as part-whole constructions.81 These constructions are thus in contrast to those of
alienable possession, which encode two entities as being associated, but easily separable.","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152]"

2.3 MORPHOPHONEMICS
2.3.1 LENITION
   The initial /b/ of a suffix will always lenite to /w/ when it is added to a vowel-final stem, or
to a stem ending in /rll or /rr/. Compare:
        ngaj-barlî          see-AGNT (I) BUT yugu-warli      cry-AGNT (I)
        gulug-ba            sleep-FUT    BUT ngarl-wa        talk-FUT
        jany-baji           dog-PRIV (I) BUT darranggu-waji stick-PRIV (I)
        bungmaj-bulu        old.man-DU BUT lagija-wulu       coolaman-DU
        and-bi              call.out-NF BUT ngirr-wi                    growl-NF28
   In fast or casual speech this lenition can also occur within morphemes, particularly if the
bilabial stop follows /g/, or if it is in a reduplicated syllable:
        -agba           HYP            -agwa
        wugbardi        cook         — wugwardî
        bardibardî      poor bugger — bardiwardi
   There are also a couple of examples in which /j/ lenites to /y/. This occurs in reduplications
(see §2.3.6 for a discussion of reduplication):
        junmi cut >           junmi-yunmi RDP-cut
and with the causitive suffix -jirrimi after a vowel-final stem:
        gannga+jirrimi        return+CAUS >          gannga-yirrimi
     See §6.2.1.1 for a discussion of this suffix.
     The retroflex stop /rd/ (written d word-initially) lenites to In in reduplication:
        daguma       hit > dagu-raguma            RDP-hit
This lenition is optional before /g/ intramorphemically:
        bardgu fall ~ bargu
28 It seems likely that this lenition would also occur after other liquids, given that it occurs after /rl/ and
       Irr/; however, there are no relevant examples in the corpus.
                                                                   Phonetics and phonology    392.3.2 ELISION
   When two identical vowels a re separated by a semivowel, the semivowel may be elided,
resulting in a phonetic long vowel (this process is discussed in more detail in §2.1.4 above).
This can occur both within and across morpheme boundaries.
     darranggu-wulu tree-DU        > /darranggu-ulu/           rdarat)gu ,ulu]
     ngara-waji     drink-PRIV (I) > /ngara-aji/               Nap ,aiji]
     baraj-bulu     old.person-DU > /baaj-bulu/                ['baaii,bulu]
2.3.3 EPENTHESIS
   Epenthesis is one the strategies used when the concatenation of two different morphemes
results in an illicit consonan t cluster (see §2.3.5 for a full discussion). Thus, as /ni cannot
occur as the second member in a conson an t cluster (see §2.2.3 for a discussion of
permissible consonant clusters), an epenthetic vowel /ii is inserted between a consonant-final
stem and any suffix beginning with /n/. The examples in the corpus all involve verbs and the
suffixes -nka 'DAT', -nî `LOC' and -nnga `ABL' (see §6.1 for a discussion of verbal
morphology).
      mawula-j- + -nka       > mawula-j-i-nka         play-TH-EP-DAT
      gulug- + -nka          > gulug-i-nka            sleep-EP-DAT
      ngirra-j- + -nî        > ngirra j-i-ni          steal-TH-EP-LOC
      ngarl- + -ni           > ngarl-i-ni             talk-EP-LOC
      alalangmî j- + nnga    > alalangmi-j-i-nnga     hunt-TH-EP-ABL
    In examples in this work I will generally not segment this epenthetic vowel, but will group
it with the preceding morpheme (e.g. mawula-jî-nka, gulugî-nka).
   There is one example in the corpus in which lui is the epenthetic vowel. This example
involves the addition of the allative suffix -nmanji to a placename Junggurragurr `Tennant
Creek'. This placename has been borrowed from Warumungu and does not fit Wambaya
phonotactic constraints (by ending in a consonant), hence the need for an epenthetic vowel.
      Junggurragurr+ -nmanji > Junggurragurr-u-nmanji              Tennant.Creek-EP-ALL
2.3.4 ASSIMILATION
2.3.4.1 /w/ > /y/
   An intervocalic /w/ will assimilate to /y/ if it follows the high front vowel Iii. This process
affects the dual suffix -bulu/wulu and the privative suffix -baji/waji.
      /juguli-wulu/ > /juguliyulu/ rjuguli-, julu] boomerang-DU
      fuguli-waji/ > /juguliyaji/ r juguli-, jaijil boomerang-PRiv (I)
   This means that a morpheme which has an initial /b/ underlyingly can be realised with a /y/
(I will use orthography here for clarity):
      juguli + bulu > jugulî-wulu > juguli-yulu
   Thus, an initial /b/ lenites to /w/ intervocalically (see §2.3.1), and then the /w/ assimilates
to the 'frontness' and height of the preceding /i/, becoming /y/.
40     Chapter 22.3.4.2 OF STOPS BEFORE Im/
   When a root having a final stop is followed by a suffix beginning with the bilabial /m/, the
stop assimilates to a nasal. The examples of this involve the Class III gender suffix -ma and
the factitive suffix -mi:
       garnguj-     many        + -ma Class III > garngunyma many.III
       burnarîg-    wild.orange + -ma Class III > burnarîngma wild.orange.11l
       gurij-       good        + -mi FAC       > gurinymi    good.FAC
2.3.4.3 VOWEL HARMONY
   Unlike Jingili, Wambaya does not have many instances of vowel harmony. While the
process of vowel harmony in Jingili affects many nouns and most verbs (Chadwick
1975:10), systematic vowel harmony in Wambaya is only really found within the auxiliary,
although there are a couple of marginal instances restricted to specific morphemes.
  The ergative/locative suffix, usually -ni, has an allomorph -nu when the stem has final /u/.
The use of this allomorph is not obligatory; the two allomorphs are in free variation in this
environment. Some examples are:
     (2-9)   Mîrra ngurru               manjungu-nu/manjungu-ni.
             sit 1PL.INC.S(NP)          shade.IV-LOC
             We'll sit in the shade.
     (2-10) Daguma rig-a             darranggu-nu/darranggu-ni.
            hit        1SG.A-PST stick.IV-LOC
            I hit him/her/it with a stick.
The other morpheme which is affected by processes of vowel harmony is the suffix -barli
`AGNT'. The final vowel of this suffix can optionally be assimilated to /a/ with the addition of
the feminine suffix -rna .
        Daguma j-barlirna/daguma j-barlarna           hit-TH-AGNT.II     A discussion of this suffix is provided in §4.5.2.1.
   The vowel harmony in the auxiliary is triggered usually by the high vowels /u/ and /i/ and
affects any preceding high vowels. (There are no examples with preceding /a/ that would
allow us to determine whether it would also be affected by vowel harmony.)
   There are two types of vowel harmony in the Wambaya auxiliary: regressive and
progressive. Regressive vowel harmony involves the singular and the first person dual
inclusive subject bound pronouns (this set of pronouns will be termed `minimal'; see
§5.1.2). The underlying forms of these bound pronouns are as follows:29
        ngi     ISG.S/A
        nyi     2SG.S/A
        gi      3SG.S
        ginî    3SG.M.A

preceding Iii of the disyllabic stems:
      gin-a   3SG.M.A-PST
      ngîy-a  3SG.NM.A-PST
      mirnd-a I DU.INC.S/A-PST
  Nor does it affect the vowel(s) of the subject bound pronoun when it is added to an
auxiliary containing an object bound pronoun (in this case the suffix marks non-future tense):
      ngi-ny-a I SGA-20-NF
      nyi-ng-a 2SG.A-IO-NF
      gini-ng-a 3SG.M.A-10-NF
      ngiyi-ny-a 3SG.NM.A-20-NF
   However, when the future tense suffix -u is added any preceding vowels within the
auxiliary assimilate to the back vowel:
      ngu-ny-u   ISG.A-20-FUT
      nyu-ng-u   2SG.A-10-FUT
      gunu-ngg-u 3SG.M.A-RR-FUT
      nguyu-ny-u 3SG.NM.A-20-FUT
      murnd-u .  1DU:INC.S/A-FUT
   Any suffix with initial /u/ will also trigger this vowel harmony:
      ngu-ny-uda 1SG.A-20-NACT.PST
      murnd-uba I DU.INC.S/A-NP.AWY
   The habitual non-past suffix -ala provides the only example of /a/ triggering vowel
harmony:
     nga-ngg-ala     I SG.A-RR-HAB.NP
     gana-ng-ala     3SG.M.A-10-HAB.NP
     ngay-ala        3SG.NM.A-HAB.NP
   In the above examples a lu/ in a tense/aspect/mood/directional suffix triggers regressive
vowel harmony affecting the subject (and object) bound pronouns that precede it. However,
the situation concerning the non-minimal subject bound pronouns (i.e. all other non-singular
subject bound pronouns, see §5.1.2) is exactly the opposite. In the case of these bound
pronouns, it is the high vowel of the subject bound pronoun that triggers progressive vowel
harmony, affecting any high vowels in the following tense/aspect/mood/directional suffixes.
  Each of the non-minimal forms is disyllabic and has the same vowel in each syllable. The
underlying forms of the non-minimal subject bound pronouns are as follows:
     ngurlu I DU.EXC.S/A
     ngurru 1 PL.INC.S/A
     ngirri 1PL.EXC.S/A
     gurlu 2DU.S/A
     girri   2PL.S/A
     wurlu 3DU.S/A
     îrri    3PL.S/A
42    Chapter 2   Consider the following examples, in which suffixes that were triggering regressive vowel
harmony in the discussion of the minimal subject pronouns above are themselves affected by
progressive vowel harmony triggered by the vowel(s) in the non-minimal subject bound
pronoun.
    ngurlu-ny-u IDU.EXC.A-20-FUT

    wurlu-ngg-u 3DU.A-RR-FUT
BUT girri-ngg-i 2PL.A-RR-FUT
   The habitual non-past suffix also does not trigger vowel harmony with these subjects,
although it is not affected by vowel harmony itself:
      îrr-ala      3PL.S/A-HAB.NP
      girri-ng-ala 2PL.A-1 O-HAB.NP
2.3.5 REDUCTION OF NON-PERMISSIBLE CLUSTERS
    There are three different strategies employed in Wambaya to deal with the situation in
which a morphological process creates a non-permissible consonant cluster. (i) epenthesis,
(ii) assimilation of the first consonant to the other, (iii) deletion of the final consonant of the
stem. Of these, the first two were discussed in §2.3.3 and §2.3.4.2 respectively. In this
section I discuss the cases in which the stem-final consonant is deleted.
   The deletion of the stem-final consonant is the usual strategy whenever the addition of a
suffix to a consonant-final stem results in an illicit consonant cluster.30 This is the case if the
two consonants are different:
      alag-    child      +              -ji      Class I > alaji                  boy.I
      alag-    child      +              -nga     Class II > alanga .              gir1.II
      bungmaj- old.person +              -nyi-    Class I > bungmanyi-             old.man.I
      murrgun- three      +              -ma      Class II > murrgurna             three.II
or if the two consonants are identical:
      bungmaj-      old.person +         -ji      Class I > bungmaji             old.man.I
      -gun y-       PL         +         -nya     Class II > -gunya              PL.II
   There are two examples in which a consonant-initial suffix is added to a stem with a final
consonant cluster, thereby creating a triconsonantal cluster. In both of these examples it
remains the final consonant of the stem — the middle consonant of the cluster — which is
deleted:
      wawunyg- sugarbag + -ji              Class I    > wawunji             sugarbag.i
      ginganj- drown + -bi                 Non-future > ginganbi            drown330 There are two exceptions to this: (i) when the suffix is one of -ni `LOC', -nka 'DAT' or -nnga `ABL' and
    the stem is a verb an epenthetic vowel /i/ is inserted (see §2.3.3); and (ii) when the suffix begins with
    /m/ a preceding stem-final stop assimilates to the corresponding nasal (see §2.3.4.2).
                                                                               Phonetics and phonology       432.3.6 REDUPLICATION
    Reduplication in Wambaya is found mainly with verbs, with which it is used to indicate
iterative or durative aspect, or the intensity of the state described by the verb (see §6.1.7). It
is also used with a few nouns, usually marking plurality (see §4.5.3). With neither of these
word classes, however, does reduplication seem to be a regular and productive process,
being relatively uncommon and found only with a limited number of forms. Although
Wambaya is a suffixing language, reduplication generally occurs to the left; that is, the
reduplicated element is attached as a prefix. There are two main patterns of reduplication in
Wambaya, found with both verbs and nouns. At this stage of the investigation, it is not clear
what determines which reduplication pattern a particular form will follow: there are no
obvious phonological or morphological properties which characterise the two classes of
roots. Clearly, more research is required.
   The most common reduplication pattern copies (to the left) the first two syllables of the
word (or the whole word if disyllabic). In the following examples, syllable boundaries are
indicated by a period.32
     ngaj.bi             see              > ngaj.bi-ngaj.bi                        look around
     la ja:rri           light fire       > la ja-la ja.rri                        light fire (DUR)
     ngun.ju.lu          carry            > ngun.ju-ngun.ju.lu                     carry (DUR)
     nya.gaj.bi          be tired         > nya.ga-nya.gaj.bi                      be very tired33
     lung.gany.mi        make cheeky      > lung.gu34-lung.gany.mi                 make very cheeky
     la.barn.ga          branch (of tree) > la.ba-rla.barn.ga                      branch (of tree)
   If the first and second syllables of the word are identical, then only one syllable is copied:
       nya.nya.yu move around > nya-nya.nya.yu move around repeatedly
       di.di.ja   carry       > dî-dî.dî.ja    carry (DUR)
   If the word has an initial stop, this will often lenite to a glide in reduplicated forms. Thus,
/rd/ (written d initially) lenites to Id, r/ lenites to /y/ and /b/ lenites to /w/. There are no
examples of lenition of the velar stop /g/.
       da.gu.ma hit                  >              da.gu.-ra.gu.ma          keep hitting
       du.rra   be   frightened (of) >              du.rra.-ru.rra           be very frightened
       jun.mi   cut                  >              jun.mi.-yun.mi           keep cutting
       bard.gu  fall                 >              bard.gu.-ward.gu         keep falling
   The second main reduplication pattern in Wambaya is slightly more interesting as the
reduplicated part at first appears to be infixed, and does not constitute a single prosodic unit,
31 It is interesting that it is the alveolar nasal, rather than the palatal nasal, which appears in this form.
    This suggests that it is the alveolar nasal that is present before the palatal stop in the root (usually only
    the palatal nasal occurs in this position).
32 The glosses for the reduplicated forms given here are those that the form had in the context in which it
    was given. It is possible that a form may also have other meanings in other contexts. For example,
    lajalajarri may be able to have both a durative meaning such as 'spend some time lighting a fire' and an
    iterative meaning such as 'light many fires'.
33 Note that in this example, as in the two following, it appears that the final consonant of the second
    syllable has not been copied in the reduplicand. However, since in all cases this would result in an illicit
    consonant cluster, meaning that this consonant would be deleted (see §2.3.5), it is not possible to tell
    whether it has simply been copied and then deleted, or not copied at all.
34 Note that this vowel seems to have assimilated to those on either side of it.
44      Chapter 2
consisting of the rhyme of the first syllable and the onset of the second. This type of
reduplication process has been noted in other Australian languages, such as Warumungu
(Simpson 1992), Mangarayi (Merlan 1982) and Jingili (Chadwick 1975). Some examples of
this type of reduplication are:
        banymi      pass by        > banymanymî         keep passing by
        angbardi    build          > angbangbardi       build repeatedly
        bundurrijbî get full       > bundundurrijbi     get very full
        bungmaji    old man        > bungtnungmajî      old men
   Following accounts by McCarthy and Prince (1986:47) for Mangarayi we can account for
this reduplication process in the following way.
     (i) The initial consonant of the base word is considered extramelodic (i.e. it is detached
         from the base but is still available for copying).
 (ii) Attach the template of one syllable as a prefix to the base.
 (iii) Given a copy of the base, satisfy the syllable to the fullest.
 (iv) According to the universal Onset Rule, copy the initial consonant of the second syllable
      of the base as the onset of the second syllable of the reduplicated form.
  Thus, if we apply this account to the Wambaya examples, the derivation of a form such as
banymanymi is as follows:
           6        a
        (b)any mi                        A
               (b)any mi
        banymî      (b)any mî
iv. a            + 6           a
        banymi (b)any mi
   In a form such as angbardi there is no initial consonant to be extramelodic, but the rest of
the derivation remains the same:
i.        a a       a        ang ba rdi
                                                                    Phonetics and phonology   45ii.      a+       a                 a
                  g       La rî                 ,‘ u
        angbardi wig ba rdi
iv.       a+          a
        angbardi ang ba rdi
      In one Wambaya form, the template appears to be two syllables, rather than one syllable:
        garriji   `be cold' >       gamjarriji
i.      a a a         \N N
        (g)a m fl
ii.     a a + a a a                               N.   N           if         (g)a      m jt
        gamji (g)a ni ji
iv. a a + a a a        1\4-'1 N N
     gamft (g)a m Jt
  Although these two reduplication patterns account for most of the reduplicated forms in
Wambaya, there are a few other forms which are reduplicated in slightly different ways. In a
couple of examples the reduplicated form is derived by copying the last two syllables of the
word to the right:
        ya.rru.bu.rdu        walk around > ya.rru.bu.rdu-bu.rdu   keep walking around
        garr.ga.lyi          plains lizard > garr.ga.lyî-ga.lyî   plains lizard
Some other reduplicated forms (of nouns) appear to be unpredictable:
        alaji    boy > alajaji          boys
        iligirra river > ililirri       rivers
                                              CHAPTER 3              PARTS OF SPEECH AND OTHER PRELIMINARIES3.1 PARTS OF SPEECH
   There are seven parts of speech (or `word classes') in Wambaya, determined by the
inflectional and distributional characteristics of each word. These classes are mutually
exclusive:1 each root belongs to only one word class, although with the use of derivational
suffixes, it is possible for a root to move its membership from one word class to another.
These derivational suffixes are discussed in §4.5.2 (verb to nominal) and §6.2.2 (nominal to
verb). The seven parts of speech in Wambaya are:
     (1)     NOMINALS
               (i) nouns
              (ii) adjectives
             (iii) free pronouns
             (iv) demonstratives
              (v) locational nominals
             (vi) temporal nominals
            (vii) indefinite/interrogatives
      (2)    VERBS
      (3)    AUXILIARY
      (4)    ADVERBS
      (5)    PARTICLES
      (6)    CLITICS
      (7)    INTERJECTIONS
   Of these seven word classes, the two largest and most important are the open classes of
verbs and nominals. These two classes have quite distinct morphological and syntactic
characteristics. Nominals generally inflect for gender, number and case and usually function
as the arguments of the clause.2 Verbs on the other hand are inflected for tense, co-occur with
the auxiliary and typically function as the predicate of the clause. Both classes also have
different derivational possibilities. Although word-class membership is determined primarily
on grammatical and functional grounds such as these, it is also possible to characterise the
difference between these two word classes on semantic grounds: verbs typically describe
states, actions and events, and nominals usually denote entities, objects and attributes.3
   In the following discussion I divide the word classes into `inflecting' (nominals, verbs and
the auxiliary) and `non-inflecting' (adverbs, particles, clitics and interjections).","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"
"42    Not all of the possible combinations are attested in the corpus. In fact. I have been able to get a complete
      set of these different case forms only for Classes I and II. I have not been able to get ergative/locative or
      dative forms of Class tit or Class tv demonstratives. The main reasons for these gaps are the infrequency
      with which Class III or Class Iv nouns occur in either the ergative/locative or dative cases. and the
      difficulty in forcing the demonstrative to be present on the rare occasions that these nouns do occur in
      these cases. In the few examples in which I succeeded in forcing a Class iv demonstrative in a transitive
      subject NP, the nominative form of the demonstrative was used:
          Yana                ngangaba-ni ngiyi-ng-a             irrijabi.

          This stick scratched me.
      Chadwick (1978) also does not give ergative/locative or dative demonstratives for Classes ut and IV, so it.
      is unclear if it is a gap in the data or a gap in the system.
108    Chapter 4   The forms in Table 4.14 are organised with the proximate forms first (singular, dual then
plural) followed by the remote forms (singular, dual then plural). For comparison, the
demonstratives given in Chadwick (1978) for the other Eastern Group languages/dialects are
given following each set of Wambaya forms. As the nominative and accusative forms are
always homophonous in all languages, I have listed them together under the heading NOM/
ACC.

      that they have a proximate meaning, rather than a remote meaning, in Wambaya.
44 I have called this case `LOC' on analogy with the Wambaya case although it is not exactly the same in all
      languages/dialects. While all the Eastern Group languages/dialects have one case suffix that is used to
      mark both ergative and locative case functions (-ni), both Gudanji and Ngarnga have an alternative case
     suffix that can also be used to mark locative case (-nbi). Ngarnga also has a separate instrumental case
     suffix, -warndu, unlike the McArthur dialects, which use the ergative/locative case suffix in this function
      (Chadwick 1978:161).

the preceding vowel, can be elided in fast or casual speech.

remote suffixes: -yaga and -ma. The form -ma is found only with singular nominative/
accusative forms, whereas -yaga (or its reduced form -ya) can occur with all forms. There
does not appear to be any semantic distinction between these suffixes.
  The remote singular forms in the other Eastern Group languages/dialects (taken from
Chadwick (1978:203) are:

   The demonstratives in Wambaya have been morphologically conservative, retaining the
original prefixing system. Thus, gender in the demonstratives is indicated by prefixes, most
of which correspond with the gender suffixes found on Wambaya nominals (see §4.2.2 and
Appendix B for a discussion of gender marking). The following table gives both the gender
prefixes found on demonstratives and the main gender suffixes found on other nominals.
                               TABLE 4.15: GENDER MARKING

                                                   -a     -I   It can be seen in the above table that the Class II prefixes on demonstratives correspond
exactly with the first pair of Class II noun suffixes (-rna and -nga). The Class III absolutive
prefix also corresponds exactly with the Class III absolutive noun suffix. The Class I
absolutive prefix -î and the noun suffix ji are very similar and probably both derive from an
original prefix -ji, the initial consonant of which has lenited in the present-day forms. That
this is the original prefix is supported by the appearance of the prefix ji- in some Class I
demonstratives in Binbinka, such as jirriga `remote singular nominative/accusative Class I'.
The Class ry prefix -ya is probably related to the suffix -a found on some Class IV nouns and
modifiers. The fact that the gender prefixes on demonstratives are similar to the suffixes
found on other nominals supports the theory that gender suffixes on nominals may have
developed from the reduction of postposed demonstratives (see Appendix B and I. Green
1995 for a comparative discussion of gender marking in the Mirndi languages).
   The demonstrative system is easily analysable. All dual and plural forms can be derived
from the singular forms, and the singular forms are made up of a gender prefix, a stern and
either a proximate or a remote marker. The complete structure of a demonstrative can be
schematised as follows:
      Gender prefix + Stem + `Distance' + Number(.Gender) + Case
      Notes:
        (i) `Distance' refers to `proximate' versus `remote'.
       (ii) The `number' slot only contains gender marking in plural number.
112     Chapter 4
         (iii) There are two forms in which the order of the `number' and the `distance'
               suffixes are reversed: inuwuliyaga `remote dual nominative/accusative Class I'
               and nanawuliyaga `remote dual nominative/accusative Class II'.
     The different forms for each of these categories are as follows:
Gender prefixes (ABS; NABS)
    Class I: {i-; ni-}
    Class II: {na-; nga-}
    Class III: {ma-; ?}
    Class Iv: {ya-; ?}
Stem
        Nominative, Accusative:        { -ni- (I); -na- (II, Iv); -ma- (III) }45
        Ergative/Locative:             { -nki- (I, II), -nka- (II) }46
        Dative:                        {-naga-
   When the remote suffix -yaga is added to the stem, the final low vowel of the stem
becomes high. Thus, -na- becomes -ni-yaga; -naga- becomes -nagî-yaga, and so forth.
   Evans (1990) discusses the tendency in Australian languages for demonstratives to derive
from verbs of stance (i.e. `sit', `stand' or `lie') or verbs of perception (i.e. `see, look').
Thus, it is possible that the nominative and accusative demonstrative stems in Wambaya, if
their underlying form is taken to be -na- (see footnote 45), may have developed from the
common non-Pama-Nyungan verb na meaning `see, look' (Evans 1990:144).
    The dative stem -naga- appears to be made up of the nominative/accusative stem -na-
followed by the suffix -ga which occurs with all non-singular object and oblique free
pronouns in Ngarnga and Gudanji (Chadwick 1978:51), and appears in Wambaya non-
singular oblique pronouns with the addition of the comitative suffix; for example, mirndiga-
yîlî `1DU.INC.OBL-COMIT'.
Distance
      Proximate: {-0}
      Remote:    {-yaga/-ya; -ma)
   The remote suffix -yaga is reduced to -ya when it is followed by either the dual or the
plural suffix. The remote suffix -ma is found only in the singular nominative/accusative
forms.
     There are a couple of examples in the corpus in which both remote suffixes are used:
45  The variation in the form of the stem can probably be explained in terms of vowel harmony and analogic
    nasal assimilation. Thus, if the underlying form is taken to be -na-, then the Class i form (-ni-) could be
    explained in terms of vowel harmony triggered by the preceding high vowel in the prefix, and the Class
    tit form (-ma-) as assimilation of the alveolar nasal in the stem to the bilabial nasal of the prefix. There
    is no evidence that these assimilation processes are productive synchronically (most vowel harmony is
    regressive (see §2.3.4.3) and there are no other known instances of such nasal assimilation). However,
    the presence of the alveolar nasal in the stem of the two Class iii Binbinka demonstratives ntaniga
    `remote singular nominative/accusative Class w' and manigula `remote dual nominative/accusative Class
    Ill' adds support to the theory that the Wambaya Class Ili stem may have derived from one containing an
    alveolar nasal.
46 Note that this stem becomes -nka- in Class ti proximate non-singular forms, but elsewhere remains -nki.
                                                                                         Nominals     113        i-na-ma-yaga47 remote singular nominative/accusative Class I
        na-na-ma-yaga remote singular nominative/accusative Class II
   There does not appear to be any difference in meaning between these forms and the
corresponding forms in which only one remote suffix is present.
Number
    Singular. { -0 }
    Dual:      {-wulu (ABS), -wulî (NABS)}48
    Plural:    {-gunji (I, ABS), -gunyi (I, NABS); -gunya (II, ABS and NABS); -gunyma
               ABS); -gunja (IV, ABS) }49
   Note that the plural number markers also indicate gender.
Fa ce   Although the sterns indicate case, case is also separately marked at the end of the
demonstrative. Except with the nominative and accusative cases, the form of the case suffix is
dependent on the number of the demonstrative.
        Nominative, Accusative: { -0)
        Ergative/Locative: SG { -0 }
                          DU { ji )
                          PL { -ni}
        Dative:           SG { -0)
                          DU Via}
                          PL {-nka}
   The dual and plural case suffixes are regular for nominals: the regular nominal suffixes are
-0 for both the nominative case and the accusative case, -ni for the ergative/locative case and
-nka for the dative case, and nominals inflected with the dual suffix take -ji in the
ergative/locative case and -ja in the dative case. The only aspect of case marking that is
unusual to demonstratives is that the singular forms have a zero inflection for the
ergative/locative case and the dative case. Usually a singular nominal would take the regular
ergative/locative and dative case suffixes (see §4.4).
   Below are some selected Class I forms illustrating this morphological structure.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]"

1.2.3.2 KINSHIP TERMINOLOGY
    The Wambaya kinship terms are given in Figures 1.2 (male ego) and 1.3 (female ego). As
is common in Aboriginal Australia, this is a classificatory kinship system: these kinship terms
are used for anyone in the appropriate category, regardless of whether they are actual
consanguineal or affinial relatives. Another characteristic of this system, also common in
Australia, is that same-sex siblings are treated alike. For example, a woman calls her sister's
children by the same terms that she uses for her own; likewise a man with his brother's
children. Similarly, parallel cousins (i.e. the children of same-sex siblings) are treated as
siblings. Where there are two terms for a category in the charts below, the first refers to the
younger sibling and the second to the elder sibling. One's parents are referred to with the
same term as for their younger sibling. Thus:
      F
      irda
      barnangîla
means that îrda is the term for both father and father's younger brother and barnangila is the
term for father's elder brother.
   I have not given any of the synonyms for these kinship terms. Synonyms and near
synonyms can be found in the word list in Appendix D.
   Note that the cyclical nature of this system means that kin types can be defined in a number
of different ways: for example, one's `mother' (M) could also be one's `brother's son's wife'
(BSw); and one's `mother's mother' (MM) could also be one's `cousin's wife' (FZSw). To
avoid cluttering, I have not listed every possibility in the charts but leave it to the reader to
trace these alternative relationships themselves, if desired, using Table 1.3 above.
   It is important to note that only a limited amount of work has been done in the area of
Wambaya kinship and that, as indicated by the queries in the following charts, more research
is needed.

terms can be formed with the suffix -gulanji/-gulanga, discussed in §4.5.1.3. Kinship terms
can also be inflected with the suffix -liji, which appears to be a reflexive-possessive suffix
indicating that the `possessor' of the kin is the subject (or the topic) of the clause. This suffix
is discussed in §4.5.1.2.

   The phonemes for Wambaya are given in Table 2.1 below. The orthographic symbol for
each phoneme is given in parentheses following the IPA symbol. Note that, as voicing is not
distinctive in Wambaya, the decision to use the voiced IPA stop symbols in Table 2.1 is
arbitrary, although it reflects the Wambaya community's choice of orthography. For the rest
of this chapter I will use the orthographic symbol to represent the phoneme (e.g. In not /.V).
Long vowels are given below in parentheses to indicate their rarity. There are only a handful
of words with long vowels in the corpus; these are discussed in §2.1.4.

retroflex /r/, and lamino-palatal /y/. There is a three-way vowel contrast with a very limited
length distinction; long vowels are found in only a handful of words — see §2.1.4.

8    Chapter 1
1.2.2 PRESENT SITUATION
   The majority of Wambaya and Gudanji people still live in South Camp, Elliott; Wuppa
Camp, Tennant Creek; and Mara Camp, Borroloola. The only communities on their
traditional land are a small community of Wambaya who have moved back out to Corella
Creek and an even smaller community of elderly Wambaya/Gudanji living at Coolminyini
Outstation just out of Borroloola. There are also a few Wambaya/Gudanji people who live at
Murunmurula on the South Nicholson River, although this is actually Waanyi country.
    The lifestyle of the Wambaya and Gudanji people today (at least, those who live in town)
is typical for Aboriginal town communities. Social Security payments and town food supplies
have completely replaced hunting and food-gathering as the means of subsistence, and there
are alcohol-related problems. Although the kinship and subsection systems are still known
and understood by even the youngest members of the community, the marriage laws are often
not adhered to by the younger generations, much to the disgust of the older members of the
community.
   As for the Ngarnga and Binbinka communities, it seems that they have all but disappeared.
I met only one old man who claimed to be Ngarnga (and one old woman, who has since
died) and no-one who called themselves Binbinka. There are reports that there are some
Binbinka people (who can still speak the language) living on Nutwood Downs Station, but
this has yet to be confirmed.
   The Eastern Group languages are in a critical state. A recent survey of language speakers
undertaken by Robert Hoogenraad (pers.comm.) lists 32 people who claim to be full
speakers of Wambaya, 10 who claim to be full speakers of Gudanji, only one for Ngarnga
and none for Binbinka. Of the 32 people on Hoogenraad's list who claim to speak Wambaya
fully, at least 10 received roars of laughter when this list was double-checked with some of
the older speakers.l"" My estimates are that there are probably only between 8 and 10 really
competent speakers of Wambaya left, and only about 6 or 8 competent speakers of Gudanji. I
believe that Hoogenraad's figures for Ngarnga and Binbinka are correct although, as
mentioned above, there are claims still needing confirmation that there are some Binbinka
speakers living on Nutwood Downs Station.
   All of the Wambaya and Gudanji people that I have worked with speak a dialect which is a
mixture of Wambaya and Gudanji. The balance of this mix differs greatly — some speakers
speak predominantly Wambaya with some Gudanji whereas others speak mostly Gudanji
with a bit of Wambaya — but the two dialects are almost always mixed together. In fact most
of the older people claim that the two communities and dialects have always been mixed up
and that it is not possible, nor appropriate, to try and separate them.18 Some evidence that17 One of the difficulties here which may have helped cause this discrepancy is that people will often differ
     in their conception of what it means to `speak' a language (especially with reference to languages which
     are no longer widely spoken). Thus, someone who is really only a `half' speaker of a language may
     claim to speak it fully if they are surrounded by people who hardly speak it at all. Another factor that
     may have boosted these figures is that some of Hoogenraad's information came from people other than
     the purported speaker. If these people are not proficient in the language themselves, they may not be able
     to accurately judge the level of competency that somebody else may have in the language, or they may
     describe someone as a speaker of a language by virtue of their belonging to the tribe that speaks/owns
     that language.
18 This issue caused a great deal of argument at a Wambaya language meeting and literacy course held in
     Tennant Creek (April 1993) as a couple of (less than fluent) speakers kept insisting that it was possible,
     and indeed important, that the two dialects be clearly separated. This was to the great frustration of the
     older people who claimed that it was impossible and inappropriate to do so.
                                                                         The language and its speakers
there has been a greater degree of mixing of the two dialects in recent years, however, comes
from a 1987 file note from Papulu Apparr-kari, the language centre in Tennant Creek. In this
note, one old (now deceased) Wambaya man is reported as claiming that there are only two ,
fluent Wambaya speakers left (of which he was one) as all the other speakers have mixed the
language up with Gudanji.
   All of the competent speakers of Wambaya and Gudanji are over about 55 years old, and
most of them would be over 60. There are a couple of people under 55 (perhaps in their 40s)
who have a good command of Wambaya, although in speaking it they tend to substitute a
number of grammatical elements from Kriol. Most of the people that I have met over the age
of about 40 have a reasonably good to excellent passive knowledge of Wambaya or Gudanji
but rarely speak it. None of the younger generations can speak the language at all, apart from
the subsection terms, kinship terms and some selected lexical items. Only a few people that I
met under about 30 could even understand sentences spoken to them in Wambaya or
Gudanji. There is, however, some interest among some of the younger people in learning to
read an d write Wambaya, with the intention of possibly teaching some to the children in
school.' 9
   The usual language of communication for all of these people, including the older ones, is a
variety of Kriol or English ranging from quite a basilectal variety of Kriol among the older
speakers to something closer to Aboriginal English among the younger ones. For most of the
people this is their first (and only) language.","[25, 26, 27]"

   The non-singular possessive pronouns are derived by adding to the pronoun base the
possessive-deriving suffix -gan-, inflected for gender: ji/-nyi- `I ABS/NABS', -rna/-nga- `II
ABS/NABS', -ma 'III ABS' and -ga/-gi- Iv ABS/NABS'. The final nasal of the suffix -gan-
assimilates to the place of articulation of the following palatal or velar stop (i.e. with the Class
I and Class Iv suffixes), and is dropped before an alveolar or bilabial nasal (i.e. before the
Class II absolutive suffix and the Class III suffix).77
   In Wambaya, as in many Australian languages, there is a contrast between two types of
possession: alienable possession and inalienable possession. The possessive constructions
discussed so far in this work, in the discussion of possessive demonstratives (§4.6.1), the
genitive suffix (§4.4.10) and the possessive use of the dative suffix (§4.4.4), have all
involved alienable possession; cases in which the possessed item is considered separate and
detachable from the possessor. The nature of inalienable possession, on the other hand, is
that of a part-whole relationship; the two entities are considered to be inseparable such that
what is happening to one nominal (the 'part') is conceived of as simultaneously happening to
the other nominal (the 'whole') (see, for example, Hale (1981), McGregor (1985), Chappell
and McGregor (1989), Chappell and McGregor, eds (1995) for a discussion of inalienable
possession in both Australian languages and more generally). The semantic contrast between
these two construction types is shown in the following English examples:
      The dog bit me on the hand = The dog bit me (inalienable (or part—whole))
      The dog ate my dinner      #    The dog ate me (alienable)
   The dative and genitive suffixes and the possessive demonstratives can be used only in
constructions of alienable possession, which is also the most usual use of possessive
pronouns (see examples (4-292) to (4-295)). However, for purposes of emphasis (4-296) or
in verbless clauses (4-297), it is possible to use possessive pronouns in constructions of
inalienable possession.
  Some examples of the use of possessive pronouns follow. For a discussion of inalienable
possession see §4.9.",[147]

31 The suffix -mbili in Jingili is used to mark both locative and comitative case functions (see Chadwick
     1975:20).
                                                                                          Nominals   934.4.10 GENITIVE SUFFIX
   The genitive suffix, along with the proprietive (§4.4.11), the privative (§4.4.12) and the
origin (§4.4.13) suffixes, is different from the case suffixes discussed above in that it
functions adnominally, relating one NP to another within one constituent. In contrast, the case
suffixes discussed above function to indicate the role of a NP within a simple clause and
therefore have a relational function (Dench and Evans 1988:2). Formally these suffixes differ
from other case suffixes in that they are inflected for gender and (except for the genitive) can
themselves be inflected for case.
   The genitive suffix marks the possessor of a possessive NP and agrees in gender with the
possessed (head) noun. More commonly the dative suffix is used to mark possession (see
§4.4.4), and there are thus only a limited number of examples of the genitive suffix in the
corpus. Almost all of these examples have Class Iv agreement, but there are a few with Class
I and Class II agreement. The regular forms of the genitive suffix are nîganji (I), niganya (II)
and niganka (IV);32 irregular allomorphs are found with kinship nouns and are discussed
below. The first vowel of the regular suffix assimilates to the preceding vowel of the stem,
giving the alternative forms nuganka and naganka. The genitive suffix is attached to the non-
absolutive gender form of the noun. Some examples are:
   (4-146) Nayidanga-nî guyala nguy-udi                  ngajbi, juwa-nîganka.
           woman.II-LOC NEG       3SG.NM.A-NACT.PR see           man.I-GEN.IV
           Women can't see (the dance), (it) belongs to men.
   (4-147) Yana            balamurru       bungmanyi-nîganka.
           this.IV.SG.NOM spear.IV(NOM) old.man.I-GEN.IV
           This spear belongs to the old man.
   (4-148) murlu-nuganka mijangga
           eye.IV-GEN.IV medicine.IV(NOM)
           eye medicine
  The case suffix of the possessive phrase appears only on the head noun (i.e. on the
possessed noun); there is no case marking that follows the regular genitive suffi x. This is true
whether the head noun precedes or follows the genitive noun. Some examples of genitive
phrases with non-zero case suffixes are:
   (4-149) Yarru ngi          bungmanya-naganka magi-nmanji.
           go     ISG.S(PR) old.woman.II-GEN.IV camp.IV-ALL
           I'm going to the old woman's camp.
   (4-150) Ayani ngi             magi-nka     bungmanya-naganka.
           look.for ISG.S(PR) camp.IV-DAT old.woman.II-GEN.IV
           I'm looking for the old woman's camp.
   However, speakers will accept as grammatical examples in which both the possessed noun
and the genitive noun are inflected for case, although they do not produce such examples
themselves:
   (4-151) Mina ngi            alangi-niganka-ni                  jalyu-ni.
           sit      ISG.S(PR) boy.I-GEN.IV-LOC                    bed.IV-LOC
           I'm sitting on the boy's bed.","[110, 111]"
"
4.7 LNDEFLNITE/INTERROGATIVES58
   There are five indefinite/interrogative roots in the corpus, which are used to indicate that
the (full) identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker. These forms are frequently used
in interrogative function, requesting the information about the referent's identity from the
addressee. This interrogative function, however, cannot be considered a part of the core
meaning of these forms as they can be used contexts that are not compatible with an
interrogative meaning, namely those in which they co-occur with the inferential enclitic =mijî
(see below).59 When combined with their various inflections, these five roots cover the
meanings 'someone, who', 'something, what', 'something, which', `for something, why',
'somewhere, where', `from somewhere, where from', 'some amount, how many/how
57 The alternation in the vowel of the stem is triggered by the following high back vowel of the dual suffix.
58 In Nordlinger 1993a I used the term 'ignorative' for this word class (following Karcevski 1969 and more
     recently Wierzbicka (e.g. 1980)). However, as Mushin (1991, 1995)   .      has pointed out, there are two
     components to these words: an ignorative component (which indicates that knowledge is at issue) and an
     epistemological component (which characterises the type of knowledge at issue). For this reason the
     more neutral term 'indefinite/interrogative' has been chosen. In other discussions of Australian languages
     these words have been referred to as `interrogatives' (e.g. Dixon 1972, 1977, Merlan 1994), 'inter-
     rogative/indefinite pronouns' (e.g. Austin 1981a, Morphy, 1983), 'indefinite pronouns' (Dench 1995),
     'indeterminates' (Donaldson 1980) and 'epistememes' (Mushin 1991, 1995).
59 This discussion has benefited from McGregor's (1990:146ff) discussion of such forms in Gooniyandi.
120 Chapter 4much', `sometime, when' and `somehow, how'.60 There is a strong tendency for indefinite/
interrogatives to be initial in the clause.
   As indicated by the term used, indefinite/interrogatives are found with two different
functions in the corpus: indefinite (4-249) and interrogative (4-250).61 In the former
function, they often co-occur with the enclitic -miji `INFER' (7.7.1.1).
   (4-249) Gayina=miji                       irr-a dîdîma.
             something.IV(ACC)=INFER 3PL.A-PST     tell
             They (must have) told him something./I don't know what they told him.
  (4-250) Gayina             irr-a       didima.
          something.IV(ACC) 3PL.A-PST tell
          They told him something./What did they tell him?
   Each of these examples expresses the fact that the speaker does not know what it was that
the subject told the object. As far as I can tell, the difference between the indefinite meaning
of example (4-249) and that of (4-250) is that in the former the speaker is indicating that
he/she is only inferring that anything was `told' at all. Such examples are often translated in
Aboriginal English using `must be', as in `I don't know what they told him, must be
something.'
   I will now discuss each of these indefinite/interrogatives individually. A general
interrogative particle is discussed in §7.5.1.","[137, 138]"

2.2.1 SYLLABLE STRUCTURE
   The following syllable types are found in Wambaya. Types (i) and (ii) can occur only
word-initially and types (iv) and (v) do not occur word-finally. Type (iii) is the most common
syllable type and the only one that is unrestricted in its occurrence.
        (i)     V      e.g. a.ya.nî             look for
        (ii)    VC     e.g. ang.ba.rdi          build
       (iii)    Cv     e.g. ya.rru              go
       (iv)     CVC e.g. garr.ga.lyi            plains lizard
        (v)     CVCC e.g. lurrg.ba.nyi grab, snatch
    Type (v) is highly restricted and is possible only when, as in lurrgbanyi, it is part of the
tri-consonantal cluster /rrgb/. This cluster is further exemplified in §2.2.3.
   As well as constraints on the word position of different syllable types (mentioned above),
there are different constraints on the onset of a syllable depending on its position within the
word. Thus, while the syllable onset13 that follows an open syllable (e.g. cv.cv(C)(C)) can
be any consonant, that which follows a closed syllable (e.g. Cvc.cv(c)(c)), or which occurs
word-initially (CV(C)(C).CV...) is restricted as to the type of consonant that can occur. There
are also restrictions on the possible coda of a syllable (e.g. VC. CVC), depending on the
consonant that follows it (i.e. the onset of the following syllable). For this reason, word-
initial consonants (CV(C)(C).CV...) and consonant clusters ((C)VC.CV...) are discussed
separately, in §2.2.2 and §2.2.3 respectively.
   However, there are some general things that can be said here about the nature of onsets
and codas.l 4 The frequency of occurrence for groups of segments as either onsets or codas in
Wambaya is largely predicted by the continuum of active articulators proposed by Hamilton
(1992, 1995) as a tool for describing the phonotactic constraints in Australian languages:15
        LABIAL DORSAL LAMINAL APICAL
 3 I am assuming the internal structure of a syllable to consist of an onset and a rhyme. which in turn is
      divided into a nucleus and a coda (as argued for in Blevins 1995, for example).
14 It should be noted here that this discussion is concerned only with onsets that belong to either initial
      syllables, or syllables following a closed syllable. It is not concerned with syllable onsets that follow an
      open syllable (i.e. those that occur intervocalically), as these are unrestricted.
15 In fact, there is little support for the distinction between labials and dorsals implied by this continuum
      (Juliette Blevins, pers.comm.).
                                                                             Phonetics and phonology       27   The prediction is that permissible syllable onsets in any given Australian language will
form a continuum of both frequency and possibility beginning from the left side, while
permissible syllable codas form such a continuum beginning on the right side. Thus,
according to this continuum, labials are more preferred as onsets than laminais and apicals,
but are less preferred as codas (which are preferably apicals). Furthermore, if a language
allows laminal onsets then it will allow dorsal and labial onsets; if it allows dorsal codas then
it will allow laminal and apical codas, and so on.
    As will be seen in the ensuing discussion of word-initial segments and consonant clusters
in Wambaya, the frequency of occurrence of segments as syllable onsets conforms to this
continuum. Thus, although the constraints differ depending on the position of the syllable in
the word, syllable onsets are most commonly peripherals (labials and dorsals). This
preference is particularly striking for onsets following a closed syllable (i.e. onsets that are
the second element in a consonant cluster; see §2.2.3). Furthermore, the most highly
restricted onsets, those which can occur only intervocalically, are either apical or laminal: /rr/,
/r/, /ly/.
    The case of codas in Wambaya is less striking, although it does not contradict the
predictions made by Hamilton. Of the five consonants that can occur finally in the auxiliary
(/rr/, /rl/, /n/, /ny/, /ngf), three are apical, one laminal and one dorsal. Although all types of
sounds are found as the coda of non-final syllables, labials in this position are severely
restricted (occurring only in one homorganic nasal—stop cluster, which clusters are excluded
in Hamilton's discussion) as, to a slightly lesser extent, are dorsals. Apicals, on the other
hand, are the least restricted and clearly the most preferred in this position.
   More specific details of onset and coda constraints, and their relationship to both
Hamilton's continuum and the sonority hierarchy, will be discussed in §2.2.2 and §2.2.3
below.","[44, 45]"
