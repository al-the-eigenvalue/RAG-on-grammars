3.1. Questions  content, polar, alternative, echo, indefinite, indirectThere are two major types of interrogative sentences: (a) content or informa-
tional questions (as with a wh- word) and (b) polar (yes-no) questions, each
with subtypes. Both typically have a sentence-final falling tone.    i) Content questions: A content question is a request for information that the
speaker expects can or will be supplied by the addressee. It requires an
ignorative word or phrase (nominal or verb; see § 15.2 for six ignorative prima-
ry stems  what, who, where, when, how, how many) and a predicate verb
occurs in the interrogative mood (§ 48.2), as opposed to a polar question in ii)
below.
    The ignorative word or phrase typically comes at the beginning of a sen-
tence, though it can occur later in the sentence as well.
    One question may contain two ignorative words conjoined by the enclitic
|=Ѥu| and as in (49) and (50).
    The verb used in a response (a, b) in the following question (32) is not nec-
essarily in the indicative mood as in (a) but is more frequently in the participial
as in (b), which is more reactive or responsive and is typically accompanied by
the reactive enclitic |=wa| (§ 54.1):(32)      Ki-naS                 tekit-a?
          who-ABS.sg.            arrive-INT.3sg.
          Who has arrived?
       a. NukaqS                tekit-uq.    ~      Tekit-uq              NukaqS.

          Nukaq arrived.
       b. NukaqS=wa             tekite-llria. ~     Tekite-llria=wa       NukaqS.
          p.n.ABS.sg.=REA        arrive-PTP.3sg.
          Nukaq arrived.The focus Nukaq for the question by ki-na may stand word-initially or not.
    Ignorative words in content questions may either be a particle (how), an in-
flected adverbial adjunct (why, when, where), or a core or demoted argu-
ment (what, who[m], which). Not only intransitive S and monotransitive P
and A, but any ditransitive T, R, or A can be questioned by an ignorative word
and the interrogative-mood verb (as illustrated in § 48.2)  cf. § 35.2.4 for ques-
168 Syntactical preliminariestions of ditransitive verbs. Content questions are more fully illustrated with
ignorative words (§ 15.2) and interrogative mood verbs (§ 48.2).
   Verbs of other moods than the interrogative, however, may also be used to
form content questions, see, e.g. § 47.2 for a participial-mood verb particularly
with the particle |ima| you know.
    ii) Polar questions: A polar question, in contrast with the content question
just above, does not occur with an interrogative-mood verb and is characterized
by the rhetorical question particle |qaa| (§ 53.2; instead of an ignorative word). 9
This |qaa| as a particle may occur independently as a free word meaning (is
that) right?  see (38b) for confirmation. But it is typically attached like an
enclitic to the sentence-initial word (except for vocative and interjective words),
nevertheless forming a non-HQFOLWLF ERXQG SKUDVH DV LQGLFDWHG E\  EHORZ
(which triggers a pre-boundary regressive accent, unlike an enclitic =).
    Depending upon which constituent is the focus of the polar question, (33)
has different constituent orders. Typically the particle is attached to the word
initial word, forming bound phrases /nùk|kàqqaa/ and /tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tùq|qaa/ with the
regressive accent on the final syllable of the first word:
(33) a. Nùkàq  qaa       tekit-uq?         Has Nukaq arrived?
        p.n.ABS.sg.QST arrive-IND.3sg.
     b. Tekít-ùq  qaa           Nukaq      Has Nukaq arrived?
        arrive-IND.3sg.QST      p.n.ABS.sg.
 thereby showing that the questioning qaa is not an enclitic. Compare with
enclitic bound phrases Nukaq=llu /nùk|kaq|ܾu/ Nukaq also and tekituq=llu
/tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tuq|ܾu/ and he arrived with no regressive accent (*/nùk|kàqܾu/,
*/tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tùq|ܾu/).
    A ditransitive verb in polar questions is shown by:
(34)         Arna-mA  TDD       cikir-aa         angunR
             woman.REL.sg.QST give-IND.3sg.3sg.man.ABS.sg.

             Did the woman give the man ice cream? Is it the woman who gave
             the man ice cream?9.     It is interesting to note that the distinction in verb mood that CAY makes between
       polar questions (marked by |qaa|) and content questions does not obtain in its clos-
       est neighbors Central Siberian Yupik (CSY; Western Eskimo) and Iñupiaq (East-
       ern), where the interrogative mood is employed for either type of question, but that,
       among the neighboring languages, Yukaghir, an isolated Paleosiberian language,
       follows exactly the same pattern as CAY, with an interrogative mood and the same
       contrast between the two types of questions  see Krejnovich (1982: 150151) and
       Endo (1993: 8385).
                                                                    Sentence types 169
    A response to an polar question typically occurs with the affirmative particle
|ii=i| /ií=i/ ~ /ii=í/ yes (35) 10 or the negative |qaaƾ| /qaáƾ/ ~ |qaƾƾa| /qàƾƾa/
no (36) 11 in the sentence-initial position, and if a verb accompanies (though
not obligatory), it is done reactively in the participial mood and with the in-
teractive enclitic |wa| or declaratively in the indicative mood:(35)       Ii=i,    tekite-llria=wa      /            tekit-uq.

           (VVn |-ksait-| not yet; § 44) instead of -(l)lria.","[219, 220, 221]"
"    When replying to a negative question, Yupik speakers confirm or deny the
statement made in the question either with the particle ii=i yes or
qaang~qanga no (showing the same pattern as Japanese but not as English),
as in (37a) vs. (b):(37)      Tekite-ksait-tuq        TDD       Nukaq?

          yes      arrive-not.yet-PTP.3sg.=REA yes arrive-not.yet-IND.3sg.
          Yes (as you asked), he has not arrived yet.

          No, he has arrived.   A polar question with _TDD_ is formally distinguishable from the confirma-
tion of a presumption by the questioner using the particle independently. Com-
pare (a) a polar question with (b) a confirmation:
10. It is very common, however, to raise the eyebrow slightly to express yes, often,
    though not necessarily, out of shyness. This is not only the case with children.
11. Pragmatically, however, the use of this negative particle may be more or less
    avoided, especially where definite negation could not be guaranteed (as in future
    events or happenings), in favor of some hedgings such as naamiki I dont know, I
    am not sure, aipaagni perhaps (fifty-fifty; aipa-agni partner-LOC.3du.sg.).

er request:(39)      Ner-la-kek  qaa?            May I eat them (du.)? [JS,IW]

|waѤѤu| or (§ 53.5-vi) becomes an alternative question (A or B) with the po-

"   An appositional-mood question may have some difference from an inter-

   The interrogative word that is obligatory in content questions may be a verb
instead of a nominal or a particle, which should be in the interrogative mood:(20)      Ca-avet                pata-ngnaq-vakar-cit?
          do.what-CNNbc.2sg. hurry-CNA-ITS-INT.2sg.

"    The most common particle of this group is the particle |qaa| is it so? is that
right? as used independently. But it is much more commonly used for a polar
question marker (yes-or-no type; § 5.3.1-ii, etc.), appended like an enclitic to
the first word of a clause involved, forming a bound phrase (like a second-
position enclitic, though it is not an enclitic and hence marked by non-HQFOLWLF 

3.2. Commands  direct and indirectOptative-mood verbs are most commonly used for commands.   i) Direct  optative verbs with the second person subject. In the following
pair, (a) is direct and may sound too harsh, while the periphrastic construction
(b) consisting of the prop verb |pi-| (§ 49.4.2) and an appositional-mood verb
(§ 51.3.1) is more polite but possibly has the added implication of doing some-
thing else:(55) a. Naquges-gu                    irnia-nP.
        put.belt-OPT.2sg.3sg.         child-ABS.2sg.sg.
        Put a belt on your (sg.) child.
     b. Naqugg-luku            irnia-n P         pi-u.
        put.belt-APP.3sg.      child-ABS.2sg.sg. PI-OPT.2sg.3sg.
        Put a belt on your (sg.) child (while you are doing something in the
        meantime).
         cf. § 4.2.5.5.2-ii.
174 Syntactical preliminaries   A third-person optative verb is mainly used for asking permission or consent
from the addressee (instead of a command  ii.a). It can also be used to avoid
the directness as a disguised person (§ 32.3.2) for a second person.
   There are a few other devices to avoid the directness, e.g. use of the suffix
|-qaћլ-| (§ 49.4.3).
   A prohibition or negative command is expressed by an optative-mood verb
expanded with the general negator VVn |-nћլit-| (§ 44, § 49.6.1).   ii) Indirect  various constructions may serve as indirect commands:      a. a third-person subject optative verb (let him)  § 49.2
      b. the directive complex transitive verb with |+sqѠ-| A to tell / ask him
         to  § 40.2.2
      c. use of the modal suffix VVm |+naћլqѠ-| (§ 43) in an indicative-mood
         verb (you should).","[224, 225, 226]"
"The question by the appositional verb is a more indirect way of asking or can be
a more serious form of asking (to make sure who are actually coming) than the
compared one by the interrogative verb tai-ciq-at (INT.3pl.), which may not be
an important question, or may be an initial question without a preceding verbal
exchange.",[1534]
"   One constituent in coordinate nominal phrases (with =llu and) may be a
target for questioning  e.g. X and my mother:(27)      Ki-naP=llu                tanger-sikek     aana-kaP?
          who-EX.ABS.sg.=and        see-INT.2du.3sg. Mo-ABS.1sg.sg.

   Multiple interrogative words (e.g. when and where?) can be formed in a
single question:(28)       [Qangvaq na-ni=llu]              aana-kaP     tange-llru-siu?

2.1. In complex transitive constructionsContent questions may be formed with regard to an element in an embedded
clause in complex verbs (§ 40), which cannot be done with binary questions,
and with regard to a core argument or an adjunct.
   Questions are formed with regard to an element in the lower (embedded)
clause in (30), (31a), (32), (33b), but also in the upper clause in (31b), (33a), cf.
concatenated interrogative clauses (§ 4.1.3.1-iii):(30)       Na-ni         uita-ni-atgu?

or making:(34)      Qangvaq keni-vka-llru-siu                       u-naP

a verb asking, not knowing, etc.:(35)      [Alqa-ak          na-nte-llr-anek](T)

           Where did they come from?
         by contrast, the main clause is also a question with its interrogative
        word in the following:

                             Indirect (rhetorical) questions I wonder: |=kiћլ| 1359

4.2. ReplyIndependently used appositional verbs very often occur as answers to questions,
which may possibly imply something contrary to that which is supposed by the
questioner:(212)     Aana-nS  TDD            ayag-tuq?        

"    While the first sentence below is typically a first question, the second tends

            Did you eat it already?                I did (ate) it.The most neutral and natural answer to the question would simply be the com-
mon particle (sentence word) of approval/agreement ii=i yes (§ 53.2). An
indicative verb nere-llru-aqa (eat-PST-IND.1sg.3sg.), with or without the pre-
ceding particle, is a flat answer given as a mere fact, while the appositional verb
ner-luku, usually pronounced with a rising tone at the end, is more emphatic
(possibly implying of course).","[1532, 1533]"
"   Also interesting, on the other hand, is the fact that the subject of the predi-
cate verb has to be in either the second or the third person  cf. (74) and (75).
But, if the subject is in the first person, a constantive-connective verb is used
instead, as shown by the compared sentences below:(74)       Nere-sqe-lriani            qessa-lar-tuq / qessa-lar-tuten.
           eat-A'.ask-CNV             disinclined-REG-IND.3sg./2sg.
           Whenever asked to eat, he doesnt / you dont feel like eating.
       cf. Nere-sq-aqanga             qessa-lar-tua.
           eat-A'.ask-CNNwv.3sg.1sg. disinclined-REG-IND.1sg.
           Whenever he asks me to eat, I dont feel like eating.(75)       Ca-arka-li-lriani=ggem                  tai-li.
           do-VNrl.FUT-have.lots-CNV=ENC           come-OPT.3sg.
           He comes whenever there is much to do. [EM]
            sounds more critical/resigned in tone than indicative tai-lar-tuq
           (REG-IND.3sg.). See § 49.4.1 for the optative and § 54.3.iv for
           the co-occurring enclitic =ggem and also compare with:
1348 Participial mood       cf. Ca-arka-lir-aqavet=ggem                    tai-lii.
           do-RCL.FUT-have.lots-CNNwn.2sg.=ENC        come-OPT.1sg.
           I come whenever you(sg.) have much to do (the time I come is al-
           ways when you have much to do).     iii) Distict from relativizer: This constantive |-lћլiani| is formally identical to
a participial relative clause (VNrl) in the locative plural, as stated above, e.g.
kai-lria-ni in/with ones who are hungry (LOC.pl.; § 17.2.1), tempting one to
directly relate the two with each other and to gloss it as a locative form
(in/with/for/to ones who are hungry) rather than when(ever) one is hungry/
whenever there is a hunger. But I am inclined to think that the converb is dis-
tinct, in terms of actual force, from a locative-case plural relative clause. A rela-
tive clause should have a corresponding singular form (kai-lria-mi), whereas the
converb -lriani in question never has *|-lћլiami|. See Miyaoka (1994a) for more
discussion.
     Lastly, it should be added that, while participial verbs and nominals have the
suppletive variant |+1ƾXћլ| (after /t/), the converb |-lћլiani| does not (*|+1ƾXћլni|);
|-lћլiani| is the only form for this converb and occurs also after stem-final /t/.
Compare the converbs (76) with the participial nominals in the locative plural
(77):(76)       assi-lriani     whenever good  |asiћլ-| to be good vs.
           assiite-llriani whenever bad  |asiit-| to be bad; cf. *assiil-ngurni.(77)       assi-lria-ni   (at) ones who are good  LOC.sg. assi-lria-mi vs.
           assiil-ngur-ni (at) ones who are bad  LOC.sg. assiil-ngur-mi.(78)       ilumun celli-naq-lar-tuq                 kesianek     atu-llriani,

           surely it (knife) has to be sharpened all the time whenever using

to be taken as a special converb with no inflection. This would not exclude the
possibility, however, that the converb form, despite its now fully endowed ver-
bal force, is not related with the nominal participle, considering that some types
of the connective-mood verbs (quasi-connectives; § 50.11) have evidently come
(or are partly still in the stage of transition) from deverbal nominals with a case
suffix, and that a Yupik participle is, at any rate, a word sharing two functions
(cf. participate).

There are a number of types of questions as stated (§ 5.3.1), in particular, con-
tent or informational questions (wh-) and binary questions (yes-no), both of
which are typically characterized by a sentence-final (highest) tone rapidly fall-
ing, displaying the same intonation as declarative sentences. While binary ques-
tions are characterized by the rhetorical question | qaa| (is that right?  sen-
tence adverbial, § 53.2) and no interrogative-mood verb, content questions
obligatorily contain an interrogative word (§ 15.2) and a verb that is generally
in the interrogative mood (this chapter). Content questions are also possible
with verbs in other moods than the interrogative  the participial (§ 47), optative
(§ 49), and appositional (§ 51).","[1399, 1400, 1401]"

utterances (made by the addressee) or contexts, meaning well, but, yes, also,
instead of, as for . Particularly frequent in conversations and narrations, often
with more or less exclamative force. Very commonly heard in radio broad-
casting as an expletive sentence fillers, though younger speakers tend to use
|wani| instead (§ 53.6-ii).
    The variation, enclitic or non-enclitic, is basically dialectal, and the latter

1. Functions and morphologyIgnoratives are a class of morphologically diverse words, functionally common,
however, in that they are required in content questions (§ 5.3.1) in which the
head verb selects the interrogative mood (§ 48), and they may subsume not only
ignorative uses (e.g. where, § 15.2) but also non-interrogative uses, i.e. indefi-
nite (somewhere, § 15.3.1) and negative (nowher, § 15.3.2).
    There are six ignorative stems, two nominals, two ambivalent, and two parti-
cles:
Table 11: Ignorative stems

                                     na-                                         where

                                     qavciћլ-                                    (to do) how many
particles                            qa(ƾ)- / qaƾvaq, qaku                       when
                                     qai- / qaillun                              how
444 Ignoratives    The three of them |na-| where, |ca-| (to do) what, and |ki(t)-| who have a
limited extent of denominal derivation.
    Either nominally or verbally, they inflect only to a limited extent and not all
in the same way. While |ca-| what and |ki(t)-| who inflect for number and
case, |qavciћլ-| how many and |na-| where inflect only for case (but the latter
like adverbial demonstratives). The expanded (nominal) ignorative stems
|na(t)-|, etc. that are derived from |na-| where inflect for person (possessor) 
see § 12.3.3 for |+t-| selected by adverbial demonstrative stems to derive loca-
tion nouns.
    A verbally inflected ignorative word in the interrogative mood functions by
itself as a content (or wh-) question. This is also the case for interrogative claus-
es that consist of the ignorative |qaillun| how or |ca-| (to do) what and the
generic bivalent stem |pi-| to do; thing (§ 10.3.1) in the causal-connective,
appositional, or participial mood.
    Ignorative words used in conjunction with an interrogative-mood verb |pi-| 
e.g. pi-a (INT.3sg.) just below  are frequently used as a kind of set phrase for
expressing uncertainty (e.g. I am not sure how, I cant really say how [but...])
besides their use in asking questions (e.g. how does he, whats wrong with
him?):(1)       qaill (qangvaq, qavci-nek,        ki-na,          na-ni,..)
          how when         how.many-ABM.pl. who-ABS.sg. where-LOC
           pi-a
          do-INT.3sg.
          I wonder how (when, how many, who, where...) he/it does.","[493, 494, 495, 496]"
"The sentence with the appositional verb seems to be more appropriate in actual
(possibly more serious) situations for precise information, as when it is already
known that someone is using dogs (e.g. aata-ka ikamrar-luni aya-llru-uq my
father [aata-ka ABS.1sg.sg.] left [aya-llru-uq IND.3sg.] with a dogsled
[ikamrar+Ø+luni have-APP.3Rsg.; NV|+Ø-|). On the other hand the com-
pared example with the interrogative-mood inflection sounds like a general,
more isolated, or possibly casual question, and could be a first question uttered
without a preceding context. Likewise:(216)       Kit-u-u-luni?                (And) who is she?
            who-EX-be-APP.3Rsg.

            who-EX-be-INT.3sg.",[1533]
"   Content questions may be illustrated with ditransitive verbs:(25) a. Ki-aA          cikir-tau         angun R      akuta-mek(T)?
        who-REL.sg. give-INT.3sg.3sg. man.ABS.sg. ice.cream-ABM.sg.

"The appositional verb is more probably a question about an aforementioned

2. Content questionsIn content questions, an interrogative word (phrase or clause) typically occurs in
the sentence-initial position and a verb, if any, is typically in the interrogative
mood, as in (10a), but can also be in the appositional  (10b), as well as (21),
(22), (23)  or participial  (24b). As with other moods, tempo-aspectual speci-
fication is optional, and an interrogative-mood verb unmarked in this respect is
taken as perfective or continuative.(10) a. Ki-naS                tai-ga?

    Side by side with |-1quћլ-|, there is another remarkable suffix that reoccurs in
a fair number of anatomical terminologies from different Eskimo dialects/lan-
guages, both Western and Eastern, just a few examples of which include:   |-lu(ћլ)-| anatomical(?); obsolete:(70)      cup-luq          pipe, hose  |cupѠ-| to blow on.",[697]

2.3. Word orderAn interrogative word in content questions tends to come in the sentence-initial
position, as seen above. It may, however, occur elsewhere, particularly in the
second position as in the following examples:(37)      Kassa-tun           ki-naS              qaner-yuumiit-a?
          white.man-EQL.sg. who-EX.ABS.sg. speak-reluctant-INT.3sg.
          Who doesnt want to speak English?
           with the Russian loanword kassaq white men means English
          language with the equalis case marking.",[1411]
"    The interrogative word in content questions may either be an adverbial ad-
junct (why, when, where  particles or not) or a core or demoted argument
(what, who[m], which); see § 15.2. In the latter case, not only intransitive
S and monotransitive P and A, but any ditransitive T, R, or A can be put into a
question with an interrogative word (with the appropriate case marking) and an
interrogative-mood verb. It will be seen that a question can be made not only of
various elements within a simplex-verb clause ([15][18]), but also within an
upper-layer clause of complex transitive verb constructions with the upper-
clause agent A, A',... (§ 48.2.1).
    In the following example, the interrogative words are illustrated in S and P
function (a) and (b), and in A and G function (c) and (d):(15) a. Ki-naS           qaya-li-a             ya-a-ni?

structions, this enclitic can also occur in optative constructions, mainly with a

a kind of soliloquy (I wonder) and can be an indirect question, much less di-
rectly asking or addressing than an interrogative-mood verb, as in the compared:(39) a. Nat-mun=kiq          pi-qer-lii.

notation of addressing (asking) someone, while the optative (a) implies an ac-
tion mostly confined to the speaker. See § 48.3 for the indirect question with an
interrogative-mood verb.",[1423]
"
2.4. QuestionsAny of the three arguments T, R, A (incl. demoted ones) can be transformed
into a content question (103) through (106) with an ignorative word and an
interrogative-mood verb which is required by that type of question. This stands
in contrast to the polar question in (107) below, which is characterized by the
interrogative particle qaa. See § 5.3.1 for questions in general.(103) a. Ki-aA              cikir-tau           angunR

          Why did they ask me [R] who gave ice cream to the man.    Interrogative words predominantly tend to appear in the sentence-initial po-
sition as seen above. However, they may occur in a different position, particu-
larly in the second position (forming bound phases with the sentence-initial
word), as in Cikír-taùNL-na ?, for instance, for (103b) Ki-na cikír-tau ?
970 Trivalent (ditransitive) stems   On the other hand, polar questions are characterized by the second-position
particle qaa is it right? which forms a (non-HQFOLWLF ERXQG SKUDVH ) with the
sentence-initial word as the target of the question (which can be any argument 
incl. peripheral NP, a verb, or a non-inflecting word). Note that the verb cikir-
aa is in the indicative mood:(107)     Arna-mA  TDD          cikir-aa            angunR

3. Ditransitives compared with extended trivalentsDitransitive verbs, secundative vs. indirective, have been shown with case align-
ment of (T)ABM TABS AREL by (2) and (3) vs. TABS (R)ALL AREL by (5) and (6), etc.
in this chapter and with step-by-step representation by § 30(12) and (12)'.
    In addition to ditransitives with arguments T R A, there are different kinds of
(extended) trivalent stems, derived with one or two valency-increasing suffixes
(italicized) as given in § 35.1: (to repeat) P E A, P A AIMP , P A A' (derived from
bivalent stems) and S EADV A', EAPL S A', S AIMP A', or S A' A"" (from monova-
lent), each given in hierarchical order (§ 30.2.3(23)). They are illustrated in
sections of simplex VVsm suffixes (§ 39), i.e. A |+c-|, EAPL |+(u)c-|, EADV
|-ћi1-|, and AIMP |+naћլqѠ-|, and six VVcm suffixes (§ 40.2), e.g. directive A
|+sqѠ-|, reportative A |+ni-|. These are all possible combinations of trivalents,
given the constraint of no co-occurrence of VVsm E (applicative or adversative)
with AIMP and of their non-occurrence after VVcm.
    The seven combinations are to be classified in view of the pattern into (ex-
tended) simplex vs. complex verbs:(108) a. P E A, P A AIMP  simplex
      b. S EADV A, EAPL S A, S AIMP A, S A A, P A A  complex   Each group of combination of the three arguments follows the same argu-
ment hierarchy for case assignment (i.e. accessibility to absolutive case) as sim-
plex and complex verbs, with the only caveat related to E APL in connection with
monovalent stems, given in Table 29 (verb extension and argument hierarchy).
   The ditransitive T R A in comparison with complex and simplex verbs will
reveal the parallelism (with difference) of trivalent verbs:

3.3. Exclamations and vocatives   i) Exclamation sentences  two types, involving the use of either:
       a. two intensifying suffixes VVa |+1pakaћլ-| so much and |+1paћ-|
          intensely (§ 41.3.2)
       b. their apparently related particlizer VPc |+1paa| (§ 52.4.1)
           each occurring in a distinct construction, though substantially
          equivalent as exclamations.    (a) |+1paћ-| and its apparently related particlizer (b) |+1paa| are first illus-
trated:(56) a. Tupag-yara-tu-vag-cit                (elpet)!
        wake-early-REG-ITS-INT.2sg. 2sg.
     b. Tupag-yara-tu-vaa                    elpe-ni!
        wake-early-REG-EXC                   2sg.-LOC
        What an early riser you (sg.) are!(a) occurs with an interrogative-mood verb but without an interrogative word,
unlike content questions  § 5.3.1-i. It is a question-like exclamation. (In non-
exclamative contexts, the suffixes can occur in any verb mood  see § 46
through § 51). On the other hand, (b) is a unique morpheme which derives verb
stems into non-inflecting words taking no (core) arguments, i.e. argument-less
(see § 27.6). Furthermore (a) involves an argument, i.e. in S function, as the
target of an exclamation and may be expressed externally by an NP in the
                                                               Sentence types 175
absolutive case, while (b) may have the notional subject expressed in the loca-
tive case (§ 27.6).
    The other suffix |+1pakaћլ-| in (a) above is shown with the interrogative in-
flection:(57)      Ner-yui-pakar-cit!         (elpet)
          eat-never-ITS-INT.2sg.     2sg.
          Why havent you (sg.) eaten all this time!   See § 48.4 for a discussion of suffixal exclamations as in (56a), (57) and
§ 41.3.2 for the intensifying suffixes themselves, while § 52.4.1 for details of
the particlizer exclamation as in (56b).   ii) Vocatives: Forms used in addressing persons are chiefly characterized by
doubling of the final vowel of the absolutive form of nominals, except that a
singular vocative for nominal demonstratives ends in -suuq ~ -yuuq (§ 12.2.1
and § 31.1). Vocative demonstratives are more or less formal. Two other minor
types, as well as one with a locative-case NP referring to a first or a second
person argument, are provided in § 31.2 and § 31.3.(58) a. u-suuq         you (sg.), this one here!
                        cf. u-na (ABS.sg.) this one here
          u-ku-u-t     you (pl.), these ones here!
                        see § 12.2.1 for plural expander -ku-.
       b. aana-a / [HBC] aana-ang           mother!
       c. aana-maa                          you (sg.), my mother!    In addition, a locative-case NP referring to the second person, typically
placed in the sentence-initial position, has a vocative force if used with an opta-
tive-mood verb; cf. § 27.5.","[226, 227]"
"   The |ku| in this suffix might possibly be the non-singular expander for non-
singular nominal demonstrative stems (§ 12.1.1; e.g. u-ku-t these), non-
singular personal pronouns (§ 13.1; e.g. wang-ku-ta we), and the interrogative
stem (kin-ku-u-gat who are they?), though the identity of -n- seems to remain a
question, despite an intriguing solution by Corbett and Mithun (1996: 1316).",[724]

4.2. VPc |+naa| ~ |+nii|This is an exclamative particle that is more restricted (perhaps antiquated) than
the preceding |+1paa|. Very often occurs following the intensifying suffix VVa
|+1pakaћլ-| so much, all the time or VVa |+1paћլ-| intensely. In following a
derivational suffix, this could be taken as a particlizing suffix like |+1paa|, but it
seems to be intermediate between a suffix and a particle _ QDD_ in standing
after an inflected word or a particle (below), though it seems not to be used
independently, unlike the interrogative (polar-question) marker _ TDD_ (?; is
that right?; see § 53.2).

    Unlike |+1paa| above, the main stress with a falling tone always occurs on
the first /a/, which is a disturbance of the regular pattern of accentuation. Thus
this phonologically behaves more like the interrogative _ TDD_.","[1564, 1565]"
"   Participial mood: The enclitic typically selects a participial mood as the
predicate verb, unless it occurs in a verbless sentence:(3)      Aana-kaS=wa ~ Aana-kaS  wa            manar-yar-ciqe-l(l)ria.

          usually with a pause before manaryarciqel(l)ria
      c. My mother will go fishing.  can be a response to, e.g. (32) below.

               My mother will go fishingThe enclitic is directly correlated with the use of the participial mood verb in
(3). By contrast, use of the indicative mood, as in the compared, is proactive
and makes a statement of its own, with the enclitic not being appropriate.

"    The phrase-internal word order of the absolutive R, the ablative-modalis (T),
and the appositional verb, as in (9), is the most typical, with little flexibility. But
insertion of, say, the question particle, is possible after the phrase-initial word in
the Wickernagel position, as in qula  TDD PDOUX-gnek cip-luku thirteen?,
implying that the clause is not a fixed bound phrase.
    For an appositional construction, such as (9a) qula malru-gnek cip-luku, a
shortened expression qula malru-gnek without the verb is heard at least as a
reply to a question asking for a number. The abbreviated appositional phrase
can be considered an adjunctional phrase (with the oblique malru-gnek; § 16.5),
but as a numeral it may not be well accepted by traditional speakers.
    See § 14.3.3 also for qula malruk 12 of (1c) type, which is a juxtaposed
phrase (§ 16.3).
    The R argument as the base of phrasal numerals may be a phrasal numeral it-
self. The yuina-a-t cetaman eighty in the following is an appositive phrase for
multiplication (20×4; see § 14.3.2):(11) a. [yuina-a-t         cetama-n]R     tallima-nek(T)          cip-luku

4. Exclamations by interrogative-mood verbsAn interrogative-mood verb expanded by the intensifying suffixes VVa
(§ 41.3.2)  |+1paћ-| and |+1pakaћլ-| (cf. P2i) each with postvocalic variant
|+vaћ-| and |+vakaћլ-|  has an exclamative force when accompanied by an inter-
rogative word (§ 15). The two suffixes seem to be quasi-equivalent with little
difference if any.
    Addition of an interrogative word, e.g. ciin why, to an exclamative con-
struction as below, would make it a content question asking for a reason, e.g.
why have you been eating and eating?, why are you an early riser?, etc.   i) |+1paћ-|:(45)       nere-nqeg-pag-cit / -cia / -ta!

be nominalized into indirect questions (§ 5.3.1-vi), most frequently by the
nominalizer |+(u)ciћլ(kaћլ)-| (§ 18.2.1) and, perhaps less frequently, by |-Ѥћլ(kaћլ)-|
(§ 18.2.2), which is primarily in the past context. The |+(u)ciћլ-| type predomi-
nance for this function is understandable, given its implication of uncertainty,
while |-Ѥћլ-| type has typically an implication of particularity and actualization
and certainty. As such, the two may be interchangeable in some cases, but not in
others.
    The more common verbs of the main clause which co-occur with interroga-
tive nominal clauses include:(87) a) secundative ditransitive |apѠc-| to ask
     b) bivalent |naѤu-| not to know

        yug- and (bivalent) paqna-ke-.   i) Content questions with ignorative (interrogative) words: Examples below
