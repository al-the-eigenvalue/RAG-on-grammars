"2.2.1       Polar Question
Yes-no or polar questions do not require special word order. The word order
is usually the same as in the declarative sentence, but the order of elements

first position of the clause or sentence, if it is emphasized, as in example (38b).
The subject is normally covert in this sentence type, but if it is emphasized it
appears in the sentence.(38) a. tə, tɨŋ           kəmə-güə-bu-Ɂ            maa-güə

peek being higher than that of an affirmative sentence. The following sentences
illustrate a fragment from a dialogue. There are two speakers, KH and KNT. Sen-
tence (39a) contains a verb, but sentences (39c–d) are verbless.(39) a. Ŋɨńďilʲi,     təńiɁi͡a ďikəra-ku əmə ńi-ŋɨ

In a wh-question, the question word replaces the questioned constituent. Any
sentence constituent can be the focus of a wh-question. It is possible to ask for
person, thing, place, time, manner etc. Question words are listed in Section 4.4
in Chapter 3. The following sentences illustrate questioned NPs, such as numer-
als (44a), adjectives (44b), and possessors in possessive NP (44c).(44) a. kəði͡a, Ibula kanə           satərə        kotu-ŋu.

             KECh_080214_EvilSpirit_flkd.017A question word usually occupies the first position in a sentence; however, this
is not compulsory. Nganasan is a so-called in-situ language. It means that the
question word remains in the position, in which a non-question word (answer)
with the same grammatical function will be located. Thus, the syntactic func-
tion and the information status determines the position of the question word.
However, the question word always takes the position before the predicate (Wh
X V order). Sentences (45a–c) are examples of a sentence with a question word
in the sentence initial position. It must be noted that all question words in
sentences (45a–c) can also take the sentence internal position as sentences
(46a–c) portray.(45) a. maaďa ńi-hi͡a-ðɨ                        tənə tu-čə čińi-Ɂ.

simultaneously used wh-words. In this case, the speaker asks for two NPs. There
are some preferences according to ordering of question words: interrogatives
with reference to human entity preferably precedes interrogatives with non-
human reference. Wh-word questioning location or manner usually follows
question words referring to human object or other non-human objects.(49) a. sɨlɨ kuniɁi͡a mej-čə-ŋɨ-tɨ,           ŋuəlʲaiɁ ŋojbəu-tu.

              PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.1042.2.3       Other Questions Types
Similar to some Siberian languages such as Evenki, Tuvin, Nenets etc., there
is a special interrogative verb which cannot be used in a declarative sentence:
kumun-sa ‘say what; tell what’. The verb is historically formed from the interrog-
ative stem ku- and the verb mun-sa ‘say’ and has a regular morphology. This verb
normally takes the interrogative marker as in kumuŋu, the interogtaive future
as in kumuntəŋu ~ kumunsuðə- or the interrogative iterative as in kumuŋkəə.
There are very few examples for dubitative and reportative interogative forms
as well. The verb can be negated with the negative auxiliary, has participial
forms and can take derivational suffixes such as passive and habituative. Ques-
tion words are always missing from such sentences. The following sentences
show the usage of this verb.(50) a. tǝ, kumu-ŋu-Ɂ            ńemɨ-čǝ.

examples for this type. They are used, if the speaker has some doubts. Struc-
turally, echo-questions are like polar questions. The following sentences illus-
trates this type. The second sentence is an example of an echo-question. As the
sentences show, the asked constituent is marked by an emphatic element.(51) maaďa Dʼajku-gumi?                – ńilɨ-gəlʲičə-tə-ŋɨ?

The emphatic use of a question is typical for all Northern Samoyedic language
(Nenets, Enets and Nganasan). In this sentence type the interrogative form of
the negative auxiliary appears. This kind of sentence can express rhetorical
questions (52a), simple assertions, and assertions deduced from the context
(52b). The word order is the same as in the simple negated construction, thus
the auxiliary precedes the main verb.(52) a. kərbu-Ɂsutə, maaďa ńi-ntə-ŋɨ                      kərbu-Ɂ,

           ChNS_080214_TwoRavens_flks.0082.3      Imperative Sentences
2.3.1       Positive Imperative
The imperative has its own marker in all personal forms (including the first-
person singular); but the most common form is the second person singular
form. The tense of the imperative sentences is usually the aorist (i.e. imme-
diate future), it cannot be the past, but there are separate forms for future as
well. (For more about the personal markers see Section 5.2, Chapter 5.)
   The verb of the predicate in the imperative sentence typically takes the sen-
tence-final position, thus the word order in an imperative sentence is the same
as in a declarative sentence. The subject is not present in imperative sentences.(54) a. ǝiɁ, sʲelujki͡a-rə                tahari͡abə: tə sʲejmɨ-čə

The negative imperative is expressed with the imperative form of the standard
negative auxiliary (ńi-sɨ). The negative auxiliary in a prohibitive sentence takes
the same imperative ending as the main verb in the positive imperative sen-
tence. The imperative form of the auxiliary and the connegative of the main
verb together express prohibition. The negative auxiliary must precede the
main verb. In sum, the prohibitive structure uses the standard negative element
and the standard imperative strategy.(55) a. ŋanuďətə ŋəmsu ŋuəi-kalʲi-Ɂ ńi-Ɂ          mətu-Ɂ.

              TKF_031117_ThreeBrothers_flk.4234.4      Question Words
Quention words are used in wh-questions (content questions). They can be
classified according to the type of information they seek, and also according
to inflectional properties. Part of them shares the morphosyntactical proper-
ties with nouns, another part with adverbs. The group of declinable interrog-
atives can take number markers, the destinative suffix and possessive suffixes,
word classes                                                                             131such as ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘what kind of’, ‘which’ and ‘how many’. The interrogatives
maaŋuna ‘what for’ and sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ bare only number markers and they
can be followed by verbal suffixes as well. The word maaŋuna can be used
also with meaning ‘what kind of’ (cf. sentence (43b) in Section 2.2.2 of Chap-
ter 10). Interrogatives that behave like adverb are morphologically unchange-
able, maaďa ‘why’. Additionally, there is a question verb kumunsa ‘say what’1
(cf. Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 10). The following chart shows the most important
question words.(65) sɨlɨ ‘who’         maa ‘what’              kuďübtu ‘which’   kanə ‘how many’

                                                kunuŋu ‘where’To reference humans, the question words sɨlɨ ‘who’ and sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ are
used. The interrogative sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ is the emphatic form of sɨlɨ like Hun-
garian kicsoda ‘what for’. Interrogatives ‘who’, ‘who for’ and ‘what for’ often stay
in the predicate position, in this case, they have non-referential use. This is
demonstrated by the following sentences.(66) a. təti kobtu-Ɂu͡a munu-ntu komənsəj tənə sɨlɨ-ŋ

tinative forms have a benefactive function, which is discussed in more detail
in Section 2, Chapter 11. Although the sɨlɨ interrogative can take a possessive
suffix, it does not express a possessive relation, rather a question about which
person out of a given group did something, cf. sentence (67c).(67) a. … ou     tətə sɨlɨ i-čǝŋu        tətɨ ŋanasa-gümü

erent. This happens, when the person asking the question wants to find out the
other person’s clan affiliation. Clan names can be animal names or names of
things (e.g. hu͡aləə ‘belonging to stone’). The pair of sentences in (71) provides
an example of such a question and the answer given.(71) a. əə, tənə maaŋuna?

tive suffix is followed by emphatic suffixes—most often -güə—as in maaraagüə
‘only what’. The limitative forms of maa ‘what’ are often used: maa-raa-Ɂ ‘what-
lim-pl’ maa-raa-j ‘what-lim-acc.pl’. The limitative form of the interrogative
can be used as an indefinite pronoun as well. For indefinites see Section 4.5
below.(73) təti ńuǝ-Ɂ, sɨlɨ-ri͡aa-Ɂ hojki-r-kə-ndu-Ɂ.

           ChNS_080214_Wandering_nar.024There are two lexemes that mean ‘why’. Both are formed from the interrogative
pronoun maa ‘what’. One is mаа-ðə-(poss), in which the stem maa is followed
by the elative adverbial suffix (cf. Section 5 below), which is optionally followed
by a possessive suffix, mostly in the second person form. Another form of the
question word ‘why’ is maaďa, which is the lexicalized form of the interrogative
pronoun maa ‘what’ followed by the allative postposition ďa. No data clarifies
whether these two lexemes can be used interchangeably. It seems that maaďa
is more frequent than the interrogative form maaðǝ-. The following sentences
show the use of these words.(74) a. mаа-ðə-tə                 ŋəm-ə-btu-guj-ŋа-čə

purpose ‘for what, why?’. In this case, the interrogative pronoun is followed by
the infinitive form of the copula, which is followed by a finite form of the verb.(75) ouɁ, əmɨ-čǝ              maaŋ maa i-sʲa ǝmǝ

           ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.015The interrogatives for local cases are polymorphemic; they are based on the
interrogative stem ku-, which is of Proto-Samoyedic origin. Normally, they con-
tain one of the ancient case endings which appear on adverbs of place. Usu-
ally, no further suffixes are attached to these words. These interrogatives have
only singular forms. The forms of the interrogatives for local cases are given in
(76):

The lative form kuniɁi͡a ‘where’ and the interrogative ‘how’ are homonymic.
Sentence (77a) demonstrates the use of the word ‘how’, while (77b) displays
the use of ‘where to?’. The question word in sentence (78) is kuni, which is also

           TKF_061105_MasterOfIdols_flk.763The question word ‘where’ has three forms, kunini, kunu and kunuŋu. The form
kunu is composed of the interrogative word ku- and the adverbial locative suf-
fix -nu (for adverbial endings, see Section 5 below), but this form is very rare
(80). The form kunuŋu is formed from the ku-nu question word and the inter-
rogative marker -ŋu (cf. Section 5.5 in Chapter 5). The form kunuŋu agrees in
number with the subject, as sentences (81a–b) shows. The form kunini is also
used, which is composed of the pronominal stem ku- (82). The following sen-
tence shows the use of these question words.(80) taaču-guj-čuə-muɁ                   əmtɨ kunu?

              TNK, 20084.5      Indefinites
Indefinites are formed by attaching emphatic clitic-like morphemes to inter-
rogatives. There are three sets of indefinites: one is formed with the clitic -Küǝ
(-küə/-güə), the other is derived with the suffix -Cčə/-Cči, while the third set is
built with the suffix -CčəKüə. The suffix -CčəKüə is composed of -Cčə and -Küə.
The ordering of the morphemes is strict. (For information on clitic-like mor-
phemes see Section 4.1.6 above and Section 7 of Chapter 16.) The interrogative
derived with the limitative suffix -RA2a can express indefinite meaning as well.
   By building locative indefinites, the adverbial case marker is attached after
the emphatic clitic-like morpheme: kuni-čə-nu ‘anywhere’ [pronstem-emph-
adv.loc]. (The adverbial case markers are discussed in Section 10 below.)
Indefinites can be classified according to their morphological make-up, seman-
tics and specificity, cf. Table 3.4 below.
   Indefinites can be specific and non-specific. Non-specific forms (derived by
-Küə) refer to entities that are unknown to the speaker, while specific forms
refer to an entity that is either known or unknown to the speaker.
   The indefinite forms with -Cčǝ indicate that the referent is identifyable to the
speaker, i.e. the speaker knows who the referent is, as sentences (86a–b) show.(86) a. sɨlɨ-čə    munu-Ɂsutə, tə   ŋomtü-tüə-gitə munu-Ɂsutə …

              MDN_97_Song_song.0774.6       Negative Polarity Items
There are special NPI forms, which are derived from the interrogatives, simi-
lar to indefinites. The interrogative pronominal stem is followed by the -kəlʲičə
emphatic morpheme, as maa-gəlʲičə ‘whatever’, sɨlɨ-gəlʲičə ‘whoever’ etc. This
emphatic morpheme is identical to the emphatic suffix of personal pronouns
(cf. Section 4.1.6 above). The morpheme -kǝlʲičǝ does not carry a negative mean-
ing in itself, which is indicated by the fact that it can occur in affirmative sen-
tences as well—although in such cases it is not connected to the question word
as sentence (92) shows. The negative polarity items need a verbal licensor to
function as negative indefinites (see 93b below).(92) təniɁi͡a ďübi͡a-l-məbtɨ-rɨ-Ɂi-ðə,            təti

5       AdverbsAdverbs are used either as verbal modifiers or clausal adjuncts. Adverbs can
be classified according to their semantic characteristics or their morphological
make-up. Adverbs can be semantically divided into the following subclasses:
degree, locative, directionality and time adverbs. They can take inflectional suf-
fixes: the spatial adverbs have a locative paradigm. This section first describes
the morphological structure of adverbs then classifies them according to their
semantic properties.","[149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162]"

The full paradigm of the pronominal forms could not be fully reconstructed,
since the consultants remembered only the most frequently used forms, and
not all forms are attested in the corpus either. The analyzed texts contained
only very few occurrences of these forms, although the two emphatic mor-
phemes do occur in the texts with the əm- demonstrative as well.

These forms are usually used in responses to yes-no-questions, as can be seen

In these forms three emphatic morphemes are attached to the special pronoun
stem. The order of the morphemes is not variable. The meaning is something

paradigm was elicited from one speaker (PZCh, 2008).","[137, 138, 139]"
"3.1      Abessive
Clause negation can be expressed with a verb through the abessive marker.
While negation with the standard negative auxiliary verb simply negates, the
abessive verb conveys some extra meaning which cannot be described by sim-
ple means of logic. The word büümǝtumaɁaɁ does not convey the same mean-
ing as ńindɨɁ büɁ ‘they haven’t gone’. The form büümǝtumaɁaɁ means that ‘they
haven’t left yet’. The structure of the above sentences does not differ from the
structure of declarative sentences. Although these constructions do not belong
within the scope of negation from a syntactic perspective, this structure is a
case of sentence negation semantically speaking.
    The abessive can be used predicatively (abessive mood, cf. Section 5.10 in
Chapter 5) or attributively (abessive participle, cf. Section 6.2.4 in Chapter 5).
And what is more, the abessive participle can be derived into an adverb as
in sentence (31). Such verbs refer to actions that were expected to occur, but
have not occurred (‘not-yet’). All verbs except for negative auxiliaries can take
the abessive marker. Sentence (29) shows the verb usage, in sentence (30) the
abessive participle appears which takes the attributive position, while in sen-
tence (31), the adverbial form occurs.

Negative clauses of purpose are created by the negative supine form of the
main verb of the sub-clause, with the ending -mUŋkətə + (possessive suffix).
The nominal phrase typically appears at the beginning of the clause. If the
subject of the main clause and the subordinate clause are not the same, the
subject of the subordinate clause is either expressed by a possessive suffix on
the supine form, or by a nominal category in the genitive, or by both means, as
in sentences (32a–b).(32) a. ńuə        ďorə-lə-muŋkətə-tu,                 kundubtu-ŋu-ruɁ.

one of the supine markers appears on the negative auxiliary as in (33a–b). The
meaning is the same. (See Section 6.3, Chapter 5 for the supine suffixes.)

              MVL_080226_TwoHorses_flks.3743.3      Negative Questions and Their Affirmative Use
In negative questions, the negative auxiliary takes the appropriate inflections
and the main verb follows it in its connegative form. The question is mostly
dedicated to future and the negative auxiliary takes only the future marker as
in (34a). If the sentence is possessive or existential, the negative existential verb
ďaŋgujsʲa appears in its interrogative form, but it can use the negative existen-
tial particle ďaŋku as well. The sentence can express a real question or only pro-
vide emphasis. The negative element remains at the beginning of the sentence.(34) a. ńi-sɨðə-ŋ                tǝðu-Ɂ tobǝkǝǝ.

              TNK, 2008The other type of negative question is not a real question; it is only used to
emphasize something. In such sentences, the negative auxiliary takes the inter-
rogative marker, but keeps its sentence-final position together with the main
verb (SOAuxV structure). This sentence structure can never be interpreted as
a real question. Note that although the sentences below are syntactically neg-
ative, the meaning is positive.(35) a. Ükaďaku tahari͡aa abaɁa-nə           ďa munuŋ-kə-suə:

There are some inherently negative lexical verbs and particles which are pre-
sented in Table 12.3.
   The most frequent verb with a negative lexical meaning is ďerusa ‘not know’.
The positive conterpart of this verb is čenɨďi ‘know’. The following sentence pair
shows how the positive and negative verbs are used. The sentences below illus-
trate that the structure is not symmetric; negation is not simply expressed by
the insertion of a negative element into the sentence, but in the negative sen-
tence the negative lexical element appears.","[441, 442, 443, 444]"

4 This sentence means that the family has already eaten the reindeer which they got in ex-
  change for the daughter.

              MVL_080226_TwoHorses_flks.590The negative verb ďerusa can take subjective and objective inflections, but not
reflexive ones. Derivational suffixes are rarely attached to ďerusa, but tense
markers can appear on this verb. In sentence (38) below, ďerusa takes a tense
marker, while in sentence (37) the iterative suffix is attached to it.(37) mɨŋ dazhe mɨŋ ďeru-kə-tu-muɁ                shto təi-ču-Ɂ

           KECh_080214_EvilSpirit_flkd.017Semantically negative verbs such as ďerusa ‘not know’ can also be negated with
the negative auxiliary. In this case, the construction has a positive emphasized
meaning ‘it knows’ as in sentence (39) below. The negative auxiliary always
takes the interrogative marker. Negation in such sentences does not refer to
the presupposition and the answer must be positive.

means ‘I do not know’. It can appear as an answer to a question or it is a reaction
to an idea or event as in sentences (40a–b). The only referent of this particle can
be the actual speaker, it is not possible to refer to another person. It tends to take
the sentence or clause initial positio, but some discource particle precedes it.(40) a. sɨlʲiɁi͡a,      əməni-ə kundu͡a-tu.

notice’ and məči- ‘not get, not reach’. Both verbs appear seldom. The usage of
the verb ŋimsʲasʲi is illustrated in the sentence pair (42a–b). In sentence (42a)
the sensory verb ‘see’ is negated with the regular negative auxiliary, while in the
inquiry sentence (42b), only the negative lexical verb occurs.(42) a. ńuə-mə                 ńi-ŋɨ-ŋ         ŋəðü-Ɂ təti

         chapter 13Clause CombiningIn complex sentences, two or maybe more predicative relations are expressed,
which in European languages usually relate to a syntactic connecting ele-
ment (for example with a conjunction or relative pronoun etc.). Like in other
Samoyedic and Siberian languages, true complex sentences are not character-
istic for Nganasan, they are quite rare. Meanings expressed by a subordinate
clause in English for example, are mainly expressed by non-finite verb forms
(e.g. participles or converb construction).
   This chapter provides an overview of the common features of the traditional
clause combining strategies such as coordination and subordination. In coordi-
nated clauses, the clauses are linked together which have the same function and
are syntactically not dependent one on another. In contrast with coordinated
clauses, subordinated clauses depend on the main (matrix) clause and they
function as a constituent. There are several types of subordinate clauses: com-
plement clauses, adverbial clauses, and relative clauses. Section 1 deals with
coordination, complementation is presented in Section 2, Section 3 describes
the adverbial clauses, while Section 4 gives an overview of the relativization
strategies.","[444, 445, 446, 447, 448]"

Conjunctions are rarely used. Juxtaposition of coordinated phrases or sen-
tences is much more frequent. However, members of the younger generation,
who speak Russian well, also use Russian conjunctions. The word ŋonəə ‘and,
again, furthermore, one more’ can optionally appear as a coordinating con-
junction, primarily appearing between coordinated phrases. The Russian i ‘and’
can also be used to fulfill this function. Sentence (144a) demonstrates the
conjunction-like use of ŋonəə, whereas (144b) depicts the use of the Russian
conjunction i. For coordination of clauses see Section 1 in Chapter 13.(144) a. ouɁ, tahari͡a, tə hojməgəǝ maa kunі-ðə

               ChND_041213_Reminiscence_nar.130A contrastive relation can be expressed by the word tətilʲi͡aiɁ—or without it.
This word means ‘just, only, easily’ when used as a particle, but it can convey the
meaning ‘but’, when used to link sentence parts or sentences. In the sentence
(146b), tətilʲi͡aiɁ appears as a particle, while in (146a) it acts as conjunction. As
a linking element, it assumes the first position in a clause.(146) a. murɨŋga-Ɂ       ńaagəə-Ɂ, tətiɁlʲi͡aiɁ bəðu͡a-mətumaɁa-Ɂ

be used, as sentences (146a–b) show. Additionally, the grammaticalized phrase

                 KNT, 19948.2      Particles
Particles are quite often used. Emphasis is often expressed through morpho-
logical means in this language, i.e. emphatic suffixes or particles, which have
discourse-related meaning. Besides emphasis, particles can express condition-
ality, uncertainty, limitation or negation.
   In contrast to Nenets and Enets, there are two negative particle-like element:
ńintu(u) and ďaŋku. Both can be inflected predicatively, i.e. they can take verbal
inflections in present, but no tense marking elements for the future or past. The
particle ńintu(u) is used to negate a non-verbal predicate. The word ďaŋku is
used to negate existential, locative, and possessive sentences. (For use of these
elements see Chapter 12 for negation.)
   In general, particles do not take derivational and inflectional suffixes, thus
they are unchangeable. However, several particles can take verbal or nomi-
nal inflectional morphemes. For example, ŋɨɁtə- must take a possessive suffix,
while some others, like the negative particles ńintu(u) and ďaŋku can take ver-
bal inflectional suffixes, if they occupy the predicate position in a sentence.
Only the most frequently used particles are discussed below. What position
these words can take in a sentence and which suffixes can attach to them is
given. Particles have not been described in detail, and the analysis of text-level
discourse has yet to be pursued further.1. əku ‘maybe, probably’: This particle always appears after the predicate, gen-
erally at the end of the sentence. The verb in the sentence is mostly in the
indicative, but can take the irrealis marker (for irrealis see Section 4.8 in Chap-
ter 5). The particle ŋəndiɁaiɁ ‘probably’ has a similar meaning also expressing
uncertainty (see below). The auxiliary verb əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe’ discussed in Sec-
tion 3.3 above also has the same meaning. The auxiliary and the particle clearly
go back to the same proto-form.(148) a. tə, raďivi-čuŋ        təi-sʲüə  əku

ďa ‘almost, nearly’ (cf. Section 3.3). The particle always occurs before the word
it modifies.(149) təti-rə        maaŋuna kasaɁ səəna-mun-tuə        tɨbɨjki͡a

                KSM-ChND_061105_Hotarye_flkd.0273. mɨntu ‘can, is allowed, possible’: The particle is mostly preceded or followed
by a conditional form or by a conjugated form of the main verb. It expresses
general truth.(150) ŋəndi͡aiɁ latəi-ńə        hebɨ-m-hiɁ          ŋəndi͡aiɁ mɨntu

‘be’ verb, which has grammaticized and become a particle. It is very often used
in narrative texts. It normally appears at the end of a statement or sentence (cf.
Section 4.7 in Chapter 5 below for reportative mood).(151) tɨmini͡a maaďaa munu-ŋu-Ɂ       pervovo avgusta

              KECh_080214_Childhood_nar.1825. ŋəndiɁi͡aiɁ ‘probably’: This particle is used to express uncertainty regarding
the evaluation of an event. The particle appears immediately before the word it
modifies, as in sentence (152). Here the uncertainty refers to age, so the particle
occurs immediately before the number that expresses the age.(152) mənə ŋəndiɁi͡aiɁ mətüʔ i-sʲüəďəə                hüə-mə,

final position. In this case, the verb appears mostly, but not always in irrealis.(153) čii-ďiə             i-hü-tü,                 kotu-baaðəə-mə, təbtə-raa

              JDH_00_Fosterling_flkd.0887. təɁ ‘after all, surely’: The particle always follows the emphasized sentence
part. It often cliticizes, i.e. it is pronounced together with the preceding word.

tence medially, but it does not constitute an integral part of the sentence. The
particle əku ‘maybe’ or the auxiliary verb (əku-) often accompanies this parti-
cle. It is not clear how the two particles differ in usage and meaning. (See this
particle in Section above, the auxiliary is described in Section 3.3.)(160) a. tənə maa-güə     čenɨ-ʔ       əkɨ-tɨ-ŋ minti͡agənɨ

əəɁ ‘yes’ are used. For negative answers, two particles are used: ďaŋku and ńin-
tuu. The particle ďaŋku is used to answer a yes-no question, while ńintu serves
as the answer to wh-questions. (For interrogative sentences see Section 2.2 in
Chapter 10.)

The imperative form for third person (jussive) refers to a wish expressed from
the speaker to the third person. The mood marker is -ŋəə in subjective and
objective conjugation for one or two objects, while -ŋəi is used for the objective
conjugation for more objects and the reflexive-medial conjugation followed by
common personal ending. The following sentences show the usage of these
forms.(44) a. tə čii-ŋəə              maa-ləmu.

Admonitive can express doubt (when the intonation expresses interrogation),
additionally, it is used to state an opinion or even a polite imperative and it can
express a warning as well. The marker is attached to the S1 stem. For the sub-
jective and objective conjugation (referring to one or two objects) the marker
is -CKəə, while in the reflexive conjugation and in the objective conjugation
referring to more than two objects is -CKəi. The mood marker is followed by
the common personal suffixes. As the sentences below depict, this mood is typ-
ically used in the second person singular.(45) a. təndə      bikaa-Ɂku       kuńďi ma-lə        mej-kəə-ŋ.

Optative is used in all conjugation types, but it can refer only to the aorist tense.
Table 5.9 shows the mood markers, while sentences (46a–b) are examples with
verbs in the optative.

The interrogative mood is employed for both question types: constituent and
yes-no questions. If there is no verb in the sentence—as in the sentences
below—, the only marker indicating the interrogative mood is intonation: a
rise-fall tone. (For interrogative sentences see Section 2.2 in Chapter 10.)(47) əmtɨ maa sǝnǝ hu͡aa.

             KNT_940903_WildAnimals_flkd.298In interrogative sentences that contain a verb, the verb must be affixed with
the marker for the interrogative mood, which has a separate form for the past,
4 In all sentences, it is the subjective conjugation of optative that cooccurs with the negative
  auxiliary instead of the reflexive form.

         the S1 stem. The interrogative cannot be combined with the common tense
         marker; however, in the future forms, the imperfective suffix -NTə appears as
         a tense marker. The past tense forms and the iterative forms are portmanteau
         morphemes. Personal suffixes of the indicative mood follow the interrogative
         marker.
            Interrogative aorist forms with the mood marker -ŋU are used to reference
         present-time. It can express that the action has finished recently and it has an
         impact on the present state of affairs. If the verb is imperfective, or the verb is
         a motion verb or speech act verb, the aorist interrogative refers to the present.         (48) a. tahari͡ai kurəďi-məənɨ mɨŋ-gümü-nə         mɨ-ŋɨ-m.

         used not very frequently. It form can be used with all persons and all conjuga-
         tion types and it appears, if the action has an iterative feature in the present.
         Earlier studies do not mention it. The form was first described by Gusev (2005:
         19–20).

with the negative auxiliary, it can express emphasis as in sentences (52) below.
This kind of use of negated sentences is not only common in Nganasan, but in
other Northern Samoyedic languages as well. The only difference is that neither
Nenets nor Enets use the interrogative form, but change the word order, while
in Nganasan the word order is common as the following sentences show.(52) ńorsu, tənə ńi-bɨ-ŋ            koi-rɨ-Ɂ.

           KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.0165.6     Inferential
The inferential mood can denote evidential meaning: if the speaker does not
witness the event or action s/he is speaking about, but the circumstances sug-
gest the event is taking place and the speaker is fairly certain that the event
took place, the inferential form is used. This mood, however, is more frequently
used to express an admirative meaning: surprise, doubt, uncertainty, irony or
sarcasm. The marker of this mood is attached to the S1 stem. The inferential has
only one temporal form, the aorist and two mood markers, one for subjective
and objective conjugations for one or two objects, and another for reflexive and
objective conjugations for more than two objects. Table 5.11 exhibits the mood
markers.
   The following example shows the usage of the inferential mood expressing
evidentiality.

             ChND_061023_School_nar.033The inferential mood can appear in question sentences, in this case, the ques-
tions expressed by this mood lack the interrogative marker. The following sen-
tence is an example of a question and expresses surprise.(54) əbəj, kobtu͡a nənsu-Ɂi-ðə                munu-ntu: maaďa

             TNK_940903_KehyLuu_flkd.176The inferential can be expressed by an analytic structure: a participle form of
the main verb is accompanied by the regularly conjugated copula in the infer-
ential mood. If the present participle of the main verb is used, the meaning
of the sentence has a present reference. Past meaning can be expressed by
the past participle form of the main verb, followed by the conjugated copula
in the inferential mood. This structure is a non-verbal predication, which is
presented in Chapter 9, Section 2 below. The following sentences display this
structure.

two constructions. The inferential form ńilɨbi͡aðɨŋ of the verb ńilɨ- ‘live’ means
‘it seems, you live’, but the participial form ńilɨ-tɨə-ŋ i-hu͡aðu-ŋ means ‘it seems,
you are alive’.","[262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271]"
"2.1      Declarative Sentences
Declarative sentences are unmarked. They appear in narratives, in dialogues,
as well as in folklore texts. The common word order in declarative sentences is
SOV, thus the predicate is sentence-final, but the word order is not rigid. Chang-
ing the word order does not change the sentence type. As mentioned above,
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language, thus the subject is not obligatory
in a sentence and under certain conditions the object can be also dropped. The
following sentences show a minimal declarative sentence.(37) a.                               S       O               V

               TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.3332.2       Interrogative Sentences
There are two types of questions: one type applies a question word (wh-ques-
tions), while the other type does not (polar questions). The following types of
interrogative markers have been identified: special intonation, verbal inflection
and a special interrogative verb. The word order does not play a fundamental
role. If an interrogative sentence contains a verb, the verb obligatory takes the
interrogative mood marker. The interrogative mood suffixes are different in dif-
ferent tenses. (For more on the interrogative mood see Section 5.5 in Chapter 5.)
Verbless interrogative sentences are marked only by intonation.",[398]
"3.4.5      Locative/Instrumental Case
Nouns in the locative case are used to answer the question ‘inside what?
where?’, thus encoding spatial location, as in sentence (34). Similar to Nenets
and Enets, noun phrases with the instrument semantic role, and the mean of
the transport are also expressed by locative. A noun in the locative case can
also express location in time, thus answering the question “when?”. In this
case, however, the base is a nominal expressing a point in time such as, kičəðəə
‘month’, hüǝ ‘year’ (36b) or the name of a day (36a). The superessive can be
expressed with the postposition ńini or rarely with an NP in the locative as in
(38).

As has been referred to in Section 3.1, the use of the prolative is semantically
limited. It cannot attach to words referring to animate beings because it only
marks direction. A noun in the prolative refers to movement across or along
something or movement to the end of something, as in (43a–b).(43) a. ńajbɨ-mənɨ kuni-mənɨ ďotü-r-ü-gəj.

meaning ‘buy, exchange’ govern the prolative case, thus the price is rendered
in the prolative (45). The argument of mental verbs is most often in the prola-
tive as well (46). The direction of hitting or cutting is also marked by a noun in
the prolative (47). Furthermore, the prolative case takes part in the formation
of adverbs (see also Section 5.1, in Chapter 3). It means that adjectives in the
prolative case can serve as manner adverbs as in (49).(45) kəntə-mə              mi-ďiə-m      taa-mənu.

           KVB_97_SonOfAPriest_flks.4134       Possessive InflectionThe possessive suffixes (poss), which are often complex suffixes, are attached
to nominal categories. These refer to the person and number of the posses-
sor and also to the number of the possessed. If one entity is possessed, the
possessive marker is simple; no separate number marker is integrated into it.
Possessive suffixes have three paradigms: they attach to the stem in the (1)
nominative, (2) accusative, (3) genitive or oblique cases. Case suffixes always
precede the possessive suffix.
202                                                                    chapter 4Possessive construction:
stem + case suffix +     possessive suffix
taa- + -gətə +           -nə ‘from my reindeer’ [reindeer-el-obl.1sgposs]4.1       Paradigms
4.1.1        Singular Possession (One Thing Possessed)
When that which is possessed is a single entity, the possessive suffix gener-
ally attaches to the S1 stem. However, in the accusative paradigm second and
third person endings require the S2 stem. This can be explained by the form of
the personal suffixes: the first consonant of the suffix-initial consonant cluster
closes the stem and triggers gradation (for a detailed description of gradation
see Section 7.1 in Chapter 2). In the case of consonant-final stems a -ə- linking
vowel is also used.
    In the genitive paradigm, all suffixes attach to the S1 stem. However, grada-
tion takes place, if there is a gradation consonant in the stem, but no linking
vowel appears before the personal suffix. Therefore, the behaviour of these
forms is contradictory—no linking vowel appears (as in the case of S1 stems),
but gradation applies (as in the case of S2 stems). This duality is due to histori-
cal reasons: personal suffixes used to begin with a nasal which has been lost. Its
trace, however, triggers gradation. This empty nasal can re-appear due to nun-
nation (cf. Section 7.1.2 in Chapter 2). The personal possession markers for the
possession of one thing are presented below. As Table 4.4 shows, the endings
may coincide:
1. In first persons (1sg, 1du, 1pl) the nominative and the accusative are the
       same. Only context can reveal which case the word is in.
2. In the accusative and the genitive cases, the 2du and 3du forms are iden-
       tical again. As the table shows, suffixes have a lot of allomorphs. This
       is due to morphophonological alternations, described in Chapter 2. The
       most important changes are repeated here:
       (1) Rhythmic gradation affects consonants (see in Section 7.1 in Chap-
             ter 2). If the gradation consonant of the suffix is at the beginning
             of an odd numbered syllable and it follows a vowel, it appears in its
             weak grade, while at the beginning of an even numbered syllable,
             it appears in its strong grade: ďesɨ-ðɨ ‘his/her father’, but buəðu-tu
             ‘his/her word’. If the stem ends in a consonant or an empty slot, the
             suffix-initial consonant appears in its strong grade form: hoðar-tu
             ‘the edge of something’; hoðəbsa-tu ‘his/her pencil’.
       (2) The second person suffixes, which begin with a -r, also alternate. If
             the stem ends in an overt consonant, the suffix begins with an -l and
             the stem-final consonant is deleted. The stem-final -j palatalizes the
  nominal inflection                                                                203             following -l: baŋ ‘dog’: ba-lə ‘your dog’ and čüüj ‘sleeping bag’: čüüj-lʲə
             ‘your sleeping bag’. (For more on this morphophonological rule, see
             consonant alternation and palatalization in Section 7.7.1 and 7.4.1 in
             Chapter 2).
        (3) The suffix-initial -t changes to -č after a -j-final stem, due to palatal-
             ization (cf. Section 7.4.1 in Chapter 2). The stem-final -j palatalizes
             the following -l: küj ‘spoon’: küj-ču ‘his/her spoon’; küj ‘spoon’: küj-lʲə
             ‘your spoon’.
  The paradigm for the possessive forms of the singular possessed noun kətu
  ‘claw’ and maɁ ‘tent’ is presented in chart (49). Of the oblique cases, only the
  lative form is given.","[216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222]"

1        Inferred EvidentialityOne can speak about inferred evidential information, if the speaker was not
present as the event took place, but he can infer what happened based on visual
evidence or inference. If this inference is made based upon visual evidence, this
means that he sees the result of the event. The following sentence pair shows an
example for this usage. In both sentences the inferential mood is used, which
can be used with all persons.(1) a. təə təti təmuŋka-ku munu-ntu: əbə ńorsu maaďa

                      KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.029       In sentences (1a–b) the verb must be marked with the inferential, because the
       mouse did not see that the woman threw the moss out and left the board there,
       but he sees them lying on the tundra. Thus, his conclusion is that the moss and
       the board have been abandoned. As mentioned in Section 5.8 in Chapter 5, the
       inferential mood can be used in interrogative sentences without an interroga-
       tive marker, as in sentences (1a–b) above.
          An additional and not rare usage of inferential is to emphasize a new ele-
       ment (admirative meaning). The following pair of sentences show that the
       speaker indicates the source of the information only once. In sentence (2a) the
       speaker uses the inferential, which means that somebody should have come. In
       sentence (2b) there is no more need to use the inferential, because the speaker
       has already expressed the source of the information.       (2) a. ou, kaŋgü-čə-küə-nu         tahari͡aiɁ

              ChND_061025_Haljmira_flks.185The inferential form may have an overtone of speculation and frequently ex-
presses surprise, doubt, uncertainty, irony, or sarcasm. Example (3a) is a state-
ment, thus the verb is in the indicative, while in (3b) the speaker expresses their
surprise, thus the verb remains in the inferential.(3) a. ńük=əu-Ɂ      əməniə bələuka-ŋku-ruɁ          ləŋu-Ɂi-ðə.

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.351Inferential meaning can be expressed by the verb ńantɨďi ‘seem’ as well. This
verb is imperfective and cannot take a tense marker. Conveying this meaning
with the mood marker is also not common, there are only interrogative forms
attested. In most cases, this verb appears in the 3sg form, but there are very
few examples in which the verb agrees with the subject, as in sentence (5b)
below.(5) a. bana-Ɂa-m            ńandɨ-tɨ.

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.161The predicate in sentence (5b) is non-verbal (poor and miserable), the use of
the verb ńantɨďi is copula-like. It must be stressed however that the BE-verb can
appear in the copula position as well. However, in the latter case, the reading of
the sentence is not evidential. The examples demonstrate that, if the speaker
references momentary evidence, he uses the verb ńantɨďi, but if the statement
is general, the speaker uses the inferential form of the BE-verb. In sentence (6)

are unable to hunt.(6) əiɁ, nəŋhu͡ə ŋanuə nagür ďaməða-ŋku            i-hu͡aðu.

           KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.017The verb ńantɨďi is typically used for quotations, as in sentence (7). (For more
about the usage of this verb and of the inferential mood, see Szeverényi &
Wagner-Nagy 2017b.) In the quoted clause, the negative auxiliary does not take
the inferential suffix, but the 3sg form of the verb ńantɨďi appears as a parti-
cle.(7) tahari͡aa əməniə sʲüamu-mə,        Dʼüðɨmi͡aku sʲüamu-mə

           KES_031115_Paris_nar_1942       Reported EvidentialityAs was mentioned in Section 5.7 in Chapter 5, the reportative mood marks
second-hand information, meaning the speaker heard about the action or
event from a secondary source, as in sentences (8) and (9) below. In sentence
(8) the speaker was present during the event, but she was only a new-born baby
and thus, she heard about this event only from someone else’s narration, as she
cannot remember it. Sentences (9a–b) depict a quotation. The speaker narrates
what the girl said to him.(8) tə, təti ini-Ɂi͡a       munu-baŋhu, ńemɨ-nə

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.478The speaker may refer to the narration of a certain person, but reportative can
also be used to speak about events that are generally spoken about in the com-
munity. This mood is very often used, if a story is told about a certain person. In
this case, the feeling of reality is enhanced by the usage of the mood. It must be
noted, however, that tales and myths are told in the indicative and not in repor-
tative mood. In a folklore text, the reportative mood appears, if the story teller
reports anything or the information comes from a specific person (see sentence
8 above). During shamanic ceremonies, the shaman reports the information
heard from gods in the renarrative to those present. Normally, the information
source is not specified, but in some cases the specific person can be expressed.
In this case, the reportative form semantically expresses the quotative, as in
sentence (10).(10) tǝtі-rǝ       tahari͡a ǝmnɨ helɨ-Ɂ munu-ŋkǝ-ndu-Ɂ tǝti-rǝ

     ‘Where are you going (they ask)?’
           KES-SEN_031114_Dialog_conv.005Also, the interrogative-reportative is used, if the person being asked is sure to
know the answer.

if the question is in the interrogative-reportative. The interrogative-reportative
cannot be used in indicative sentences. If the speaker asks the question again
to express an echo-question, the interrogative-reportative is also used.(15) čaj ďaŋguj-hu͡aŋhu. – čaj ďaŋguj-hu͡a?

            TKF, 19993        Sensory EvidentialityThe auditive/sensitive forms are used when talking about events that the speak-
er has heard or has felt in some way, thus the evidence is based on auditory or
sensory evidence. There are two auditory/sensory markers (cf. Section 6.6, in
Chapter 5). In present day Nganasan there is no difference between the usages
of the two forms. It seems, however, that the adverbial form (-mUnǝɁ) is more
ancient and is presently only seldom used. The usage of the adverbial structure
is extremely rare, only 1% of all auditive forms have this form, but it was found
in recorded productions from 5 different speakers.
    Auditive/sensitive forms can be used in interrogative sentences, in which the
interrogative marker is missing. Only the presence of the question word marks
the interrogative. In the examples below, the adverbial auditive is used.(16) a. tahari͡abǝ ban-a-Ɂku-kǝi-čü         logi͡aɁ-mɨnǝɁ bǝnti-ni.

              KVB_97_SonOfAPriest_flks.044If the nominalized form (-mUnUj) is used, it takes the possessive suffix to mark
the experiencer, however, it can refer only to an experiencer expressed by a per-
sonal pronoun. If it lexically appears in the sentence, it stays in nominative (17)
or in genitive (18a), but it shows agreement in number. and the auditive form
obligatory takes the possessive suffix.(17) tahari͡aa ŋonəə     ba-mi          logi͡a-mɨnɨ-či.

           TKF_041210_NenetsManAndGiant_flkd.017Auditive can also be used, if the speaker has seen and heard the event, but the
sounds have played a more important role for him than what was seen. Very
often, verbs expressing sound effects—like munuďa ‘say’, munsa ‘say’, sojbusa
‘sound’, hɨrkuðəsa ‘say loudly’, laŋəɁkəsa ‘cry out’—are in the auditive form,
even if the speaker can see the person who produces the sound.(18) a. təni-ðə       tahari͡aa hɨrkuðə-munu-ču           maaŋuna

         chapter 7Verbal Valence and Valence-Changing OperationsThis chapter describes the basic valence pattern of non-derived (basic) verbs,
and deals with valence-changing operations. In the first section the verbal
valence is presented and classified according to the argument structure. In
Section 2 the productive valence changing processes of passivization and tran-
sitivization are shown.","[294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304]"
"7.2      Ordinal Numerals
Ordinal numerals typically mark the place of an entity in a row. The ordinal
numerals belong to the so-called ‘first/one-th, two-th, three-th’ group (see Stolz
& Veselinova 2013). The numeral meaning ‘first’ is not only derived from the
word ‘one’, it can be formed in three ways. Its stem is the word ńerə ‘in front of,
the front of something’. One form is the present participle form of ńerəðɨ- ‘be
in front of’: ńerəðɨtɨə. Another form is ńərəbtəə, which is again a derived form
of ńerə ‘in front of’. Furthermore, the derived form of ŋuɁəiɁ ‘one’ ŋuɁəimtɨə
also exists, but only in connection with the numeral biiɁ, as in biiɁ ŋuɁəimtiə
‘eleventh’. This form can never denote the meaning ‘first’.
   The derivational suffix used for the numerals from 2 to 10 and 100 is -mtUə:
-mtu(ə), -mtɨ(ə), -mti(ə). Only the final part of compounded numerals is suf-
fixed. The ‘fifth’ numeral is derived from the short form of ‘five’.

can function as a modifier or as a predicate in the sentence. When used attribu-
tively, they must agree partially with the head of the noun phrase—they have
nominative, accusative and genitive forms. The rules of agreement are dis-
cussed in Section 1 of Chapter 8 below. The following sentences illustrate the
use of ordinal numerals.(129) a. Sʲejmi      iri-nə                nagə-mtu nɨ-tɨ

subjective conjugation (for the verbal endings see Section 3.1 in Chapter 5).(130) mənə nagə-mtu-m

Numeral adverbs answer the question “how many times”. These are derived
from cardinal numerals and indefinite numerals with an adverb-forming suffix
(adv) that is formally identical to the Plural Genitive suffix. Only the final part
of compounded numerals takes the suffix.","[181, 182, 183]"
"
1        Word Order and Information StructuringNganasan is a head-final language, thus the statistically most common word
order is SOV, however the complements of the verb including the subject and
object can appear in several permutations. The simple intransitive sentence
contains at least two elements, the subject and the predicate. If the subject
is not emphasized, it is covert. Additionally, sentence adverbials can appear in
the sentence in the left peripheral position (1b) or after the predicate (1c), if any
adverbials appear at all. The following three sentences show a simple intransi-
tive sentence.(1) a. sʲiti numə-naŋku ńuə tu-sʲüə-gəj.

icate, the subject, the object and the predicate. Nganasan being a consistent
pro-drop language, an overt subject is not obligatory in the sentence. The par-
ticipant, which is already etablished in the discourse, if it is not covert, takes the
sentence-initial position. This position is the topic position, thus the default
topic in Nganasan is the syntactic subject of the sentence, the rest of the sen-
tence is the predication itself.
   The topic names the participant of the action/event, while the comment is
a statement on the topic. The topic can be preceded by discourse particle (2a).
The prototypical topic refers to a human [+human] and definite [+def] person.
For this reason, the topic is normally expressed by a proper name (2a), kin-
ship term (2b), personal pronoun (2c), but the topic can be a quantified or a
simple noun phrase (1a–c) as well. In this latter case the topic is less prototyp-
ical.(2) a. təti tahari͡aiɁ KuəɁmaɁku-mə    ďütü-gətə mənə kəmə-ďa,

topic position. In this case, the sentence initial position is occupied for exam-

introduces a new participant in the event (latǝǝ ‘bone’). In the following sen-
tence, this participant became established, thus the topic of the sentence (3b).
Topics are often made definite by possessive suffix without possessive mean-
ing as in (2b), by the anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘that, this’ as in (3b) or by
the proximal demonstrative əmtɨ ‘this’.(3) a. kəmə-ra-Ɂi-ðə,               ŋuəlɨ  ŋuə-Ɂ lataa-Ɂku-raa.

              ASS_161023_Djajku2_flkd.026In sentence (3b) both participants, the bone and the woman are given infor-
mation. The bone is an active piece of information mentioned in a previous
sentence, while the woman is the participant of the story, who is re-activated
in this sentence.
   When the introduced topic is already definite, it is possible to make the sec-
ond mention whit a personal pronoun, but in such cases the topic most often is
referred by simple verbal ending. In sentence (4a) the topic is given and active,
thus it is only referred to by a personal ending. The subject of the sentence is
covert. In sentence (4b) the topic is re-activated and expressed by the personal
pronoun.(4) a. ŋansə nənsu-ďi munu-baŋhu ńüə-Ɂkü-tü                         ďa: ńükü

              ChND_061105_Nenets_nar.013Sentence constituents in the topic position can be replaced by the anaphoric
demonstrative təti ‘that’. In this case, the deictic function of the demonstrative
is understood as topic marking and it appears obligatorily after the NP. This
new function is not obligatorily assumed and has not been grammaticalized,
however, in spoken language this usage is very frequent, and in this way the
topicalized sentence constituent is separated from the predicate. The other
demonstrative, əmtɨ ‘this’ never occurs in this function. The construct with a
topic marker is illustrated by the following sentences.(5) a. təti, Ŋińďiľi-mə        təti, Arsʲia   kuə-hu͡a-m-büə

              MACh_940808_DogLake_flkd.002The new information typically takes the position before the VP. The following
sentence pair shows the ordering of the new and old (or given) information. As
has been described, Nganasan follows so called given-before-new principle. In
sentence (6a) the new information is the tree (muŋku). This participant is the
given information in sentence (6b). This means that the speaker first states the
known element, then the new information is usually given before the verb.(6) a. maaŋuna       muŋku      ŋəði-Ɂə.

             ASS_161023_Fox_flkd.004The question words normally appear pre-verbally, but they not obligatory stay
immediately before a verb. They often take, though not obligatorily, the sen-
tence-initial position as well. The answer to a question-word question obliga-
torily contains new information, which normally takes the preverbal position.
Question words can be associated pragmatically with the focus. This suggests
that the focus position is before the verb. The following sentence pairs are wh-
questions and their answers.(7) a. tənə maa       tɨmini͡a melɨsɨj-sʲiðə-ŋ.

and with possessive markers in anaphoric functions on the NP.

Pronouns in subject position are not common. As mentioned above, subject
are often referred to only by a verbal ending, but the proximal demonstrative
əmtɨ ‘this’ and the anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘this, that’ can stay in the sub-
ject position. Another demonstrative with the meaning ‘this’ (əmə) cannot be
used as a reference marker. It can only remain as a modifier in an NP.
    The demonstrative əmtɨ ‘this’ often appears after the overt NP in non-
primary role in the clause. Furthermore, it can be used as a reference marker,
if the primary participant in one of the previous clause surfaces appears as in
(10). In this case, the NP referred to is introduced in the sentences before.(9) taa-čü-guj-čuə-muɁ,                         əmtɨ kunu.

with the 2sg referential possessive suffix (tətirə and əmtɨrə) can occur in the
sentence in the topic position. The proximal demonstrative əmtɨrə is used as a
referent to a previous discourse element for example in equative constructions
(11a), but it often appears in the sentence as a lexicalized discourse particle
(11b).(11) a. ou, əmtɨ-rə             maaŋuna ńejmɨ.

3       Existential and Locative ClausesExistential and locative clauses are rather similar in general. Usually sentences
are regarded as existential in which the speaker states something about the
existence or non-existence of something or someone. According to the defi-
nition offered by McNally (2011: 1830), these constructions are specialized or
354                                                                       chapter 9non-canonical. Three major elements can be identified in locative and exis-
tential sentences: the entity (mostly an NP) about whose existence or location
something is stated (theme or pivot), the location in which the given entity
is or exists (locative phrase or coda) and the element (copula) connecting
the theme/pivot and the location/coda. According to the definition by Freeze
(2001: 941) or Milsark (1977) the entity, the existence or non-existence of which
is stated, must be indefinite in an existential clause, but it must be definite in a
locative clause.
    The present section addresses the question how these two different types of
sentences—existential and locative—are expressed in Nganasan. As described
below, case marking does not play a role here—instead, the choice of verb is the
decisive factor in what interpretation a given sentence obtains. There are three
copula verbs in Nganasan: the “bare” copula isʲa ‘be’, the copula təisʲa ‘exist, be
present’, and the copula tənijsʲa ‘exist, be there’. One of the numerous interest-
ing characteristics of Nganasan is that at least two copulas (təisʲa, tənijsʲa) can
be used in existential sentences. Both copulas were formed by the lexicaliza-
tion of a pronominal stem (tə-) + BE verb (isʲa) combination, i.e. this structure
represents a grammaticalized pro-form for existential expression. The stem tə-
appears for example in the pronoun təti ‘that, this’ and in some adverbials as tə-
ndə ‘there [lat]’, tə-ni ‘here [loc]’. While in English the pro-form ‘there’ and in
German the expletive pro-form (es) moves to the position of the grammatical
subject, in Nganasan the element tə can only appear directly before the cop-
ula, and other sentence parts precede this complex verb. This position probably
contributed to the prefixation of the pro-form to the verb. In the complex verb
tənijsʲa the copula is preceded by the adverbial locative form (təni) of the tə-
pronominal stem. First existential sentences are discussed, followed by loca-
tive sentences.","[372, 373]"

           TNK, 2008The usage of this pronoun is like that of the previous one. If the anticipated
answer is ‘yes’, this pronoun cannot be used. This form cannot be used in sen-
tences with a past meaning, i.e. they never appear with a past tense verb or
a perfective verb with an aorist coaffix. According to the language assistant
(TNK), the sentence *mɨm-bülʲatə-nə ńakəlʲi-Ɂə-Ɂ is ill-formed. In past tense,
the same meaning is expressed by pronouns with -kəlʲičə (see Section 4.1.6.3
above).

"5.2.1      Adverbs of Place
Adverbs of place generally have four forms, answering one of the following
four questions: where? (locative), from where? (elative), where to? (lative), and
along what? (prolative). However, there are some adverbs of place that have
only got one form. Some of these adverbs not only refer to place, but also to
time or describe other relationships. The stem (noun or pronoun) is followed
by the relevant case suffix or by a postposition. Some of the place adverbs have
a demonstrative as their stem, modified with a case suffix. These adverbs are
presented in Table 3.7.
   The sentences below shows the usage of these adverbs.(98) a. əiɁ, ńü-kü-əu,          miiɁi͡a tu-Ɂ.

Adverbs of time are monomorphemic in some cases, but most often they
are derived or inflected forms. The meanings ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow’ is
expressed by the same word talu, the exact meaning is decided by the time
reference of the conjugated verb: if the verb refers to the past, the meaning is
‘yesterday’, if it refers to the future, the meaning is ‘tomorrow’ (cf. Szeverényi
2012). Compare the sentences below:(100) a. tahari͡abə mənə nakür-ü-Ɂ      talu      lʲünkürü-sʲüði-nə.

                 KES_031115_Paris_nar.132The meaning ‘tomorrow’ can also be expressed by the lexicalized adverb küði͡a-
hüɁ ‘tomorrow, upon waking up’. This is the conditional form of the verb
küði͡asa ‘get up’. This adverb appears only with verbs in the future:(101) küði͡a-hüɁ      tahari͡aa kuniɁi͡a ńilɨ-bini     ŋonəə

3       Constituent OrderNganasan is a head-final SOV language. Therefore, complements and adjuncts
typically precede the head in a phrase. This order is present inside an NP and
in complex sentences as well. Neutral sentences always conform to the SOV
structure. This pattern is the most frequent statistically, but the word order is,
however, not rigid. The actual word order of the sentence primarily depends on
the information structure of the clause. (For more about this topic, see Chap-
ter 14 below.) Sentence (56a) contains all constituents. As mentioned above,
the subject is normally expressed by null-pronouns, as (56b) it portrays. The
basic word order is displayed by the following sentences.(56) a. S                  Adv

ative clauses belong to the from group of Locational Comparatives (cf. Stassen
2011). The comparative construction in most cases contains two noun phrases:
the object of comparison (the comparee NP) and the standard NP. Quality
(qual) is normally expressed through an adjective. Three degrees of adjectives
are recognized: equality, comparative and superlative.","[407, 408, 409]"

         chapter 1IntroductionThis chapter summarizes basic facts about the Nganasan and provides an
overview of the history of the Nganasan people (Section 1). Basic information
about genealogical affiliation, dialects, sociolinguistic status of the language
and the typological profile are described in Section 2. Section 2.5 presents the
Cyrillic orthography as well as the writing system used in this volume. Section
3 provides an overview of previous works on Nganasan and describes the lan-
guage data used in this grammar.","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"2.3      Sociolinguistic Situation
The number of Nganasan has remained relatively constant over time. Consid-
erable population decreases have occurred only due to the smallpox epidemics
(in the mid-1700s, around 1830s and at the beginning of the 20th century).
The Avam tribe of Nganasan has always been the more populous tribe. There-
fore, the estimated total number of Nganasans is based on their number. The
evolution of the number of Avam Nganasans across the centuries (based on
Krivogonov 1998: 239) is as follows:Year       1700 1761 1796 1832 1900 1917
Population 872 475 837 344 663 334It must be noted, however, that the data recorded before the Soviet era can-
not be regarded as exact. The data demonstrate that the number of Nganasans
has probably never exceeded a few thousands. However, looking solely at the
numbers can lead one to draw false conclusions. Data recorded during the
16                                                                             chapter 1table 1.2   Dialectal differences                           Avam dialect                 Vadayev dialect                  Pyasina            Taimyr                      ð                ḍ~ð                       ð‘tents’            maðəɁ              maḍəɁ                  maðəɁ                      ď                  ď                       j‘day’               ďalɨ               ďalɨ                    jalɨ‘to him/her’       ďaðətu       ďaðətu ~ ďaḍətu               jaðətu‘to work’                    ŋojbəuďa                        torəuďaBased on Tereshchenko 1979: 4 and Helimski 1998: 481census are often dependent on local factors, especially, if the data were not col-
lected for the national census, but were taken from tax registers. For instance,
in Ust’-Avam Enets individuals or children of Enets–Nganasan mixed couples
have often been reported as “Nganasan”. Furthermore, demographic data do
not show a direct correlation with the number of native speakers of a language.
Recent data suggest that a decrease in the number of Nganasans population is
accompanied by further decrease in the number of native speakers. Though the
figures from 1989 show an increase in population, this probably does not reflect
a real increase in the number of Nganasans. The period in question was a time
of change, when even the minorities of Russia were optimistic concerning their
future and people were more willing to consider themselves as members of a
minority. This tendency seems to be reversing today. The data for the past few
decades are given below:5

The figures are drawn from the official Russian national census and refer to the
Nganasan minority in the whole of Russia. Therefore, the data cannot be corre-
lated with those presented above. The data from the 2002 and 2010 Russian
census should be used cautiously when interpreting them in sociolinguistic
terms. There are no exact data about the number of native speakers of Nga-
nasan, the data only show the number of people who speak Nganasan in the
territory of Russia. Previously, people had to specify their mother tongue for
the census, while in 2002 and 2010 the question was: “What languages do you
speak?” This leaves the possibility of claiming to be a speaker of a certain lan-
guage, even if it is not one’s mother tongue.
   According to my field observations and private information, the number of
people who speak Nganasan is continuously decreasing. Language assimilation
started when Nganasan were settled (see Section 1.3.2 above). Since then, it
seems that this process cannot be stopped. This assumption is supported by the
results of a sociolinguistic survey conducted by Krivogonov (1998). According
to his data, 904 people belonging to the Nganasan minority lived on the Taimyr
Peninsula in 1993–1994,6 and only 42 percent of them (378 persons) considered
Nganasan their mother tongue. Further data are also startling:
a) only 5.8 percent (52 persons) of the Nganasan minority used the language
      in everyday communication;
b) only 29.3 percent (264 persons) spoke Nganasan to their children.
Figures concerning the language competence are not optimistic either. Krivo-
gonov (1998: 252) found that only 36.1 percent of Nganasans spoke the language
fluently, 5.1 percent had minor problems, while 9.5 percent reported serious dif-
ficulties speaking the language. The data which reflect the connection between
language competence and age distribution are also worth noting. While every
6 Krivogonov does not specify in his monograph, whom he labeled as Nganasan in his research.

cent of children under 10 years of age (16 persons) spoke Nganasan. Although
the survey was non-representative, the data clearly show the status of the lan-
guage. As passing the language to further generations has ceased among the
Nganasans, an irreversible process of language loss has begun.
    Until the 20th century, Nganasans had closer contact only with the Enets.
Inter-ethnic marriages were only attested between Nganasans and the Enetses
(cf. Afanasyeva 1990); in these marriages, typically the wives were of Enets ori-
gin and switched to using Nganasan. In 1976, inter-ethnic marriages accounted
for one fourth of all Nganasan marriages: 21 per cent of all marriages were
between Nganasans and Enetses, and in the remaining 4 percent, the non-
Nganasan spouse was of Nenets, Dolgan or Evenki origin. After the settlement
of Nganasans, the traditional Nganasan–Enets relations loosened. Currently,
inter-ethnic marriages are more frequent, Nganasans marry Dolgans or Rus-
sians. Krivogonov (1998) reports that 56.9 per cent of women and 30.3 percent
of men lived in an inter-ethnic marriage. Children born to such a marriage typi-
cally speak Russian instead of the mother tongue of either of the parents, as this
is the language the parents use to communicate with each other. Therefore, it
can be stated that today the extinction of the language is an irreversible process.","[34, 35, 36, 37]"
"  3.4      The Functions of Common Cases
  3.4.1      Nominative Case
  The subject of both intransitive and transitive sentences is in the nominative,
  thus, in a non-passive sentence, it may express the following semantic roles:
  agent (24a) and experiencer (24b); in a passive sentence, the patient (24c) is
  always marked by the nominative. (For more about passive see Section 2.1 in
  Chapter 7.)

              ChND_061023_School_nar.041The subject of the copular construction is also expressed in the nominative (cf.
examples in Section 2, Chapter 9). In the case of the predicate possessive con-
struction, both, the possessor and the possessed are in the nominative case (cf.
Section 4, Chapter 9). The possessed entity is obligatorily marked with the pos-
sessive suffix which agrees with the possessor. The pronominal possessor also
appears in the nominative case, see Section 4.1.7 in Chapter 3.(25) ńemɨ-nə                ŋahu        mozhet təi-čü-Ɂ maa-güə-Ɂ

           JSM_090809_Life_nar.115The object is marked by the nominative when it occurs with some imperative
forms; cf. Section 1.2.4 in Chapter 10. In the following sentence, the form of the
possessive suffix clearly demonstrates that the object of the sentence is not in
the accusative, even though the verb would require it to be.

             KSM, 20063.4.2        Accusative Case
The direct object of a non-imperative transitive sentence is always in the
accusative case, regardless of whether the object is definite or indefinite. In
data collected in the 1960s3 the use of the accusative marker -m still occurred,
but not obligatorily, while it is presently almost completely absent. Because
the original -m ending has been lost, in the singular, only those forms still
exhibit the accusative which have undergone gradation, since in such cases, the
accusative form is in the weak grade: maɁ ‘tent’: maðə-m ~ maðə. The accusative
suffix is also present in the forms marked with the possessive suffix (see sen-
tence (28) and examples in Section 4 below), as well as in the plural, as in
sentence (29). In all other cases, the non-possessive accusative is morphologi-
cally unmarked.(28) ďaa-mtu                sarü-čə-Ɂki-Ɂə

3 Researchers from Tomsk carried out fieldwork among the Nganasan on several occasions
  between 1968 and 1972. The materials collected during this fieldwork are preserved in 11 field-
  work notebooks kept in Tomsk. Notebook 10 has, among other things, a series of paradigms
  collected for a grammatical description. The accusative marker -m occurs obligatorily in these
  paradigms, just like in the texts collected around this time.

     ‘I have said: What, will I carry sledges?’
            ChNS_080302_Wife_nar.0373.4.3       Genitive Case
The main function of the genitive case is to mark the non-pronominal pos-
sessor in an adnominal possessive construction, as in (30). As mentioned in
Section 3.4.1, the pronominal possessor stands in the nominative case. Pos-
sessive costructions are discussed more in detail in Section 4.2 of Chapter 8.
Additionally, the genitive form in noun phrases serves as the subject of non-
finite clauses (see Section 3. in Chapter 13). Furthermore, the plural genitive
ending forms adverbs of manner and time (see Section 6, Chapter 3), the object
of postposition takes also the genitive.(30) tahari͡aa sɨðɨrhobtə təɁ            əmtɨ-rə  ŋülʲi͡aðə kuhu təɁ.

            KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.2393.4.4       Lative/Dative Case
The basic function of the lative/dative is to express the direction of move-
ment or transport into something (semantic role Goal), e.g. the lative is used
to answer the question ‘(in)to where?’. Verbs referring to the beginning of a sta-
tive action (e.g. ‘fall asleep’, ‘arrive’, ‘die’ etc.) often, but not obligatorily, require
the lative case (cf. sentence 31b).(31) a. ńerə-btə-ə               ma-tə, ńenača-Ɂa          aniɁə ma-tə

ment and the beneficiary of a ditransitive construction is marked by the lative.
However, the recipient-like argument that accompanies the verbs ‘say’ and ‘tell’
is not marked by the lative, but by the postposition ďa. (This construction will
be described in more detail in Chapter 11.) The construction involving the lative
is illustrated by the following example.(32) tahari͡aa ńenama-nə           məŋkəə tɨbɨjki͡a-tə kobtu͡a-mə

           JDH_00_Handyman_flkd.042Furthermore, the Agent of a passive sentence is in the lative case. (Passive sen-
tences are described in Section 2.1 in Chapter 7.) The following sentences show
the usage of passive.(33) sɨlʲiɁi͡aðə,    sɨlɨ-tə ńakələ-rɨ-Ɂsʲiði-təɁ

Stems ending in consonants also exhibit two kinds of alternation: gradation
and some stem types experience a stem-final consonant. The latter only affects
a limited number of words, as few words end in consonants (cf. Section 1.2 in
Chapter 2), only the following vowels can occur word-finally: Ɂ, m, ŋ, r, j, and the
deleted consonant (C) in the empty slot. However, stems ending in -m or -r do
not undergo stem alternation.
    Words ending in consonants have stems where both S2 and S3 have linking
vowels. S2 stems have an -ə, while S3 stems receive a linking vowel according to
their stem class (e.g. -U: -u/ -ɨ/ -ü/-i). Chart (5) demonstrates a stem in which no
alternation of the stem-final consonant occurs. This, however, does not mean
that no gradation can occur in the stem. If the stem contains a consonant or
consonant cluster that undergoes gradation, the consonants in question in the
S2 and S3 stems are in the strong grade, since the syllable becomes open. In
these words, the S1 stem contains the weak grade, e.g. S1: huðar ‘harness’, S2:
hutarə- and S3: hutaru-.
180                                                                          chapter 4   Chart (5) below lists all words ending in -m, -n and -r. There are two words
which have all three of their stems containing a weak grade of the consonant,
that is, the strong grade does not occur even though the syllable is open: bi͡aðim
‘splinter of a bone’ and hoiðim ‘log, billet’.","[198, 199]"

PrefaceThis grammar examines the Nganasan language, an endangered Samoyedic
language, which belongs to the Uralic language family. This description is based
on the materials from the Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC) which
was created as part of the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan
project (supported by the German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1, for informa-
tion about the corpus see details in Section 4, Chapter 1). Most of the examples
are taken from this corpus and are passages from spontaneously produced
texts. Another portion of examples are elicited materials, produced either
spontaneously or in response to questions. Data which rely on existing gram-
matical descriptions (as e.g. Tereshchenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.) are
also occasionally used.
   Examples are provided in phonological transcription form with morpheme-
by-morpheme glossing. Morphemes are separated with hyphens, multi-word
categories in glosses such as ‘elderly sister’ are linked by a dot as in ‘elderly.sis-
ter’. Grammatical categories which are not expressed by a separate morpheme
are linked by a dot as in run.3sg. Nominative singular is never marked. Words
which are necessary in the English translation, but are absent in the original
text are bracketed, the only exception are the personal pronouns. Because Nga-
nasan is a consistent pro-drop language, personal pronouns only appear in
sentences seldom. The Nganasan personal pronouns are not marked for gen-
der. For the sake of economy, they are translated as ‘s/he’.
   This grammar is intended to be a comprehensive description of modern
Nganasan, which follows the traditional structure. It consists of 16 chapters
and two glossed texts. The introduction describes the sociolinguistic situation,
a brief history, typological features and gives information about the corpus
used in this grammar (Chapter 1). The phonetic features and phonological pro-
cesses are presented in Chapter 2. This chapter also deals with the phonological
and morphophonological alternations found in the data. Chapter 3 gives an
overview of the classification of the different kinds of words (word classes).
Morphological features are discussed in Chapter 4 (Nominal inflection) and
Chapter 5 (Verbal inflection). Chapter 6 and Chapters 8–13 describe the syntac-
tical and some semantic properties such as noun phrases, types of predicates,
simple and complex sentences, verbal valence and evidentiality. Pragmatic
organization is shown in Chapter 14, while Chapters 7 and 16 describe the word
formation processes. In Chapter 15 some basic informations are given about the
core vocabulary. The reason for this is that it has traditionally been one of the
most neglected area in the study of Samoyedic languages. This description is

interlineal glosses. One text is a short folklore text, the other text is a biograph-
ical narrative.
AcknowledgmentsWork on this book took its first concrete form in 2006 during my work with
Zuszsa Várnai, Sándor Szeverényi, Nóra Wenszky and Attila Novák on the Nga-
nasan morphological analyzer within the Project “Morphological analyzer of
Nganasan” supported by Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary, project
number K60807). Thanks to my fabulous colleagues, I learned very much not
only about the Nganasan phonology and grammar, but about grammar writ-
ing in general. My ideas came to a final formulation during my works with
Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev and Sándor Szeverényi on a Nganasan corpus.
This project was supported by the Deutsche Forschungesgemeinschaft (DFG,
Germany, project number WA 3153/2–1).
   I would like to thank here all persons who helped me to complete my study
on Nganasan. First, I wish to thank Tibor Mikola and Eugen Helimski, who first
introduced me to the Nganasan language and culture and who made my first
fieldwork trips to the Taimyr Peninsula possible. My fieldwork opportunities
were supported by a grant from Soros Foundation awarded to me in 1996, the
Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary) awarded to me in 2007, a project
grant from Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF, Aus-
tria) awarded to Johanna Laakso in 2008, and a project grant from the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Germany).
   Very special thanks go to my colleagues, Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev,
Oksana Dobzhanskaya, and Alexandre Arkhipov, who helped me to organize
the expeditions and who helped me during my fieldworks.
   I also thank my colleagues Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev, Jean-Luc Lambert,
Zsuzsa Várnai, Oksana Dobzhanskaya and Sándor Szeverényi for sharing with
me their field recordings and permitting me to continue researching.
   My gratitude also goes to Anna Fenyvesi, Gerrit Jawinsky, Hannah Wegener
and Alexander David Curtis for reading and correcting the manuscript of this
book. I would like to thank Marianne Bakró-Nagy, Valentin Gusev, Gerson
Klumpp and Sándor Szeverényi, who commented on the previous versions of
this grammar. Their remarks were helpful for my work. I would also like to thank
Brill: my work with the staff of the publisher has been very pleasant at all stages
of the production of this book.
   Of course, my deepest gratitude goes to my consultants in Usť-Avam, Volo-
chanka and Dudinka. Special thanks are due to my parents, to my daughter and
to my husband for their understanding, patience and emotional support.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"5.8      Necessitative
The necessitative (in earlier descriptions called debitive, cf. Helimski 1998)
expresses that the action must be done, it is compulsory. The postulated marker
-BsUTə is attached to the S1 stem of the verb. The first consonant (-b) of the
suffix drops after consonant-final stems (for the morphophonological rules see
Chapter 2, Section 7.6.2). A similar meaning can also be expressed with a con-
verb construction (cf. Section 6.4 below in this Chapter). Table 5.14 contains
the forms of the necessitative suffix in aorist. This verbal mood is only used in
aorist.
   The following sentence shows the usage of this mood.

           JDH_00_FallenEarth_flkd.038Past meaning is expressed by a complex structure: the participle of the neces-
sitative form (cf. Section 6.2.3 below) of the main verb is accompanied by the
past tense form of the BE-verb. The participle is conjugated predicatively, thus
it takes verbal personal endings. Helimski (1998: 504) describes this structure
as debitive past, thus he considers it as tense. In my opinion, this is not a tem-
poral, but a modal category. This construction is used to describe actions that
must have occurred in the past.(63) təə       čühə-nɨ         mənə basu-suðə-m       i-sʲüə-m.
     that.gen time-adv.loc I        hunt-ptcp.nec-1sg be-pst-1sg
     ‘I had gone to hunt at that moment.’
           ChND, 2016There is an analytical construction for necessitative, which is most often used
instead the verbal mood. The main verb in past tense is accompanied by the
conditional form of the BE-verb. The subject is referred to by the possessive
suffix appearinf after the conditional marker.(64) … əm-kümü čerəsʲini-tə-sɨ        ŋətu-ďüə i-hü-nə.

     ‘… I should try to ride them.’
           MVL_080226_TwoHorses_flks.2605.10     Abessive
This mood refers to events that could have happened. Similar to the above
moods, this is quite rarely used. The marker is attached to the S1 stem of verbs.
The verb can take the suffixes from the subjective and objective paradigms,
reflexive conjugation is not attested in the corpus, but would theoretically be
possible. Table 5.15 displays the mood markers.

Reflexive
   Sentences (65a–b) show a usage in aorist tense. Past meaning is expressed
by a complex structure: the abessive form of the main verb is accompanied by
the past tense form of the BE-verb, as in sentence (66). The future form is not
attested.(65) a. tuj-sʲa    təti təndɨ-či                 ďebtu-mətumaɁi-čü.

             ChNS_080302_Bear_nar.005Quite frequently, this meaning is expressed with the help of the particle ŋɨɨtə-
‘not yet’ and simple negation. The sentence pair below shows the two ways to
express similar meaning. In sentence (67a) the speaker supposes that the event
verbal inflection                                                                259is going to take place. In this case, the speaker is sure to go hunting soon. In sen-
tence (67b), however, there is no sign of presupposition from the speaker. For
this reason, in this sentence the abessive mood is not used, the verb appears in
indicative. In both cases the speaker is not hunting at the moment.(67) a. mənə ŋɨɨtə-nə                kona-mətumɨɁə-m basu-ďa.

        ‘I do not go to hunt yet.’
              ChND, 20085.11    Dubitative
This mood is applied by the speaker, if s/he intends to express uncertainty,
doubt or surprise. The dubitative marker is attached to the S1 stem and has
the form -LU (-lɨ, -lʲi, -lu, -lʲü). The sentences are often questions without the
interrogative marker present on the verb, as in (68b). The following sentences
show the usage of the dubitative mood.(68) a. kəðə=u ńükü=əu, mənə tolɨmə-lɨ-ŋ            maaďa təniɁi͡aj-ŋu-ŋ.

also appear before the mood marker. The function of this suffix in not clear, but
it cannot use without the mood marker and the sentence obligatory contains
a question word. Further investigation into the meaning of this construction is
required. The following two sentences show the verb form with the two dubita-
tive markers. According the language assistants, this construction cannot have
a past reference.(69) a. səŋür-kə-tu-mə            kuni-mənɨ

              JDH_99_ThreeTents_flkd.0655.12     Speculative
The speculative mood is an epistemic mood, expressing the speaker’s assump-
tion that the event might take place in a past with a present time result. This
expresses the meaning ‘it seems’. More rarely it can have a meaning convey-
ing evidentiality. This is described in Chapter 6 below. (See also Szeverényi &
Wagner-Nagy 2017b.)
   This mood is also mentioned in descriptions about Enets (Siegl 2013b: 288),
as well as in Nenets (Nikolaeva 2014: 101, she calls it the “approximative”). The
speculative mood is complex, the mood marker consists of a participle present
suffix (-NTUǝ, cf. Section 6.2.1 below) followed by the similative suffix -RǝKU
and the verbal personal endings, as in sentences (70a–b). According to the time
reference of the present participle, this form has a present time reference. In
contrast to Nenets, the past form is complex and it is not built using a past par-
ticiple, but the speculative form of the main verb is accompanied by the past
tense form of the BE-verb, as in (71a–b). The speculative form is documented
not only with personal endings from the subjective conjugation, but with end-
ings of the objective and reflexive conjugations as well, as in (70b) and (71a),
thus this category is a fully grammaticalized form. The future form however, is
not attested.

              ChND_080729_SevenNjote_flks.484This mood cannot indicate comparison (‘looks like’). For this construction, the
passive participle followed by the similative suffix is used. This form always
takes the predicate position and is predicatively conjugated. Forms with objec-
tive or reflexive conjugations have not been found, thus this construction is not
yet grammaticalized as a mood.

as participles, converbial forms, infinitives, and supine. Non-finite forms occur
predominantly in dependent context, thus they play an important role in sub-
ordination (see in Chapter 13). Only participles can act as predicates, other
non-finite forms are not conjugated and they are not compatible with mood
and tense suffixes. This section does not deal with nominalized forms, such as
action, place and instrumental nouns. The derivations of these forms are pre-
sented in Chapter 16, Section 6.1.2.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281]"

              ChND-KES_061107_Dialog_conv.057As can be seen above, the negative existential sentence has the same word order
as the declarative sentence: loc (coda) + theme (pivot) +verb.
   Negative locative sentences use the same negative elements as existential
sentences. The following sentences show the structure of the negative locative.
In the negated locative sentence the theme (pivot) element is always definite.
The only difference between existential and locative sentences is the word
order. In locative sentences the theme (pivot) takes the sentence-initial posi-
tion. If the coda is expressed, it usually appears before the negative element, as
in (17c), but it can take the sentence-final position as well. This may be due to
influence from Russian as in (17d).(17) a. ǝi,   huəðaa-Ɂkü-mə tə ďaŋku!

tive auxiliary, as in the following sentence. However, it must be mentioned that
this structure is very rare.

existential possessive sentence type can be negated by the negative existential
verb ďaŋgujsʲa or the negative existential particle ďaŋku. Similar to existential
and locative sentences, the particle ďaŋku is applied to the aorist tense, and
it must agree in number with the subject. However, the negative verb is used
in all three tenses (see sentences 16a–b and 17a–b above), and it must agree in
person and number with the subject. This verb can take mood markers as well
(cf. 16c and 20b). This sentence type expresses that the possessed entity is not
in the possession of the possessor.(20) a. mаа-gəlʲčə ńuə-ði            ďaŋku.

              PED_080731_Competition_nar.385If the speaker wants to pose a negated question in the present tense, s/he nor-
mally uses the simple negative particle, which regularly takes the position at
the beginning of the sentence as in (21).(21) ďaŋku-Ɂ         tənə     kola-čə.

           TNK 2008Apart from the negative existential verb, caritive suffixes can also express the
negation of a possessive structure. In this case, two structures can be differenti-
ated. The NP with the caritive suffix can appear either with an affirmative form
or with the negative existential verb. The latter likely originates from the con-
vergence of the nominative possessive presented above (Section 4.2 in Chap-
ter 8) and the caritive construction. It is difficult to decide what kind of dif-
ference in meaning there is between the two constructions, some consultants
no longer distinguish between the two forms. The first structure is potentially
more tentative than the second. According to a native speaker consultant, the
first structure (NP with caritive + verb isʲa) suggests that the possessor does not
have any of the possessed entities at all (see 22a–b). The possessee, functioning
as the adverbial complement in the sentence, takes the caritive suffix. The cop-
ula takes the regular inflectional suffixes, and it agrees in person and number
with the possessor.(22) a. kəntə-gəlʲičə-kalʲi i-ču.

both alienable and inalienable possession. In this sentence type the speaker
does not emphasize what the possession is, but rather the present state of the
possessor, namely that he or she does not have the given object at the given
time. As mentioned before, in this sentence type, the possession is the adver-
bial complement of the sentence.
   There is another possibility to negate a possessive sentence. In this sentence
type, the possessed NP takes on the caritive ending; however, it is not accom-
panied by the BE verb, but by the negative existential verb (ďaŋgujsʲa) or the
negative particle (ďaŋku). Therefore, this is a case of what is called double nega-
tion, however, the meaning is not affirmative, but negative. The possessee never
takes on a possessive personal ending. The negative existential verb must agree
with the possessed NP. As shown in the following example sentences, this con-
struction can be used for expressing both alienable and inalienable possession.
According to the consultants, with this sentence type, the speakers emphasize
that they do not own anything at all. In this construction the word order is (pos-
sessor) + negative existential + possessee in caritive.(23) a. mɨŋ ďaŋku-muɁ        nɨ-ki͡alʲi-Ɂ.

              ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.118Transitive possessive sentences must be negated by the negative auxiliary. This
is the less frequently used means for negating a possessive structure, there are
only very few examples of this in the corpus. The standard negative auxiliary
is followed by the connegative form of the verb honsɨ ‘have’. Tense and mood
markers are carried by the negative auxiliary.(24) a. ńuə ńi-sɨə                sani-j hon-ə-Ɂ.

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.3951.4      Negation of the Non-verbal Predicate
Negation in sentences with a non-verbal predicate depends on the tense. In
the aorist, the ńintuu(Ɂ) negative particle appears in the sentence immediately
before the predicate instead of the standard negative auxiliary. As the sentences
below demonstrate, in most cases the negative particle also takes verbal suf-
fixes, not only the nominal constituents of the predicate (see sentence 25a). It
can occur that either the negative particle or the nominal part does not take the
verbal suffixes in this construction. This happens relatively often in more care-
less speech meaning, if the speaker speaks quickly. If there is a possessive suffix
on the nominal predicate, only the negative particle takes the verbal inflec-
tions, as in sentence (25c) below.(25) a. tə, tərəďi i-hü-tü                      mənə ńintuu-m aniɁə-mənɨ

              JA_0609_TwoTents_flkd.254If the sentence is not in the aorist, the negative auxiliary must be used, because
the negative particle cannot have both the tense and mood markers. The aux-
iliary takes the tense marker and the verbal suffix, but the connegative form of
the copula also appears in the sentence. Future tense sentences with a nominal
predicate are formed in a similar manner as in past tense sentences. Thus, it can
be stated that Nganasan applies the nominal strategy for non-verbal predicates
and that this is independent of the type of the predicate.(27) a. sɨtɨ ńi-sɨə               {ńaagəə ŋuə-Ɂ}.

              TKF_061025_SongOfATsar_flks.056In negative sentences word order is partly fixed, as the negative verb is always
followed by the sentence constituent being negated—in this case, the nominal
predicate. The negated copula must immediately follow the predicate in such
sentences, and these two form a constituent. In other cases, the negative aux-
iliary and the connegative form of the verb tend to appear next to each other
(cf. Section 1.1 above).","[434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"
"4.1     Existential Possessives
The copula təisʲa ‘exist’ is used in existential possessive sentences. The pos-
sessed NP, which is the grammatical subject of the clause, normally takes a
possessive suffix that agrees in person and number with the possessor. The
pronominal possessor does not obligatory appear in the sentence, because the
possessive suffix refers to it. Sentence (46) shows a possessive sentence without
a pronominal possessor, while sentence (47) contains a pronominal possessor
and the possessed entity is marked by a possessive suffix. The possessive con-
struction can be modified with quantifiers, as in the examples (46) and (48b)
below. The word order is always (possessor)-possessee-verb, if the possessor is
present in the sentence.(46)                                     possessee possessor       tahari͡aa tɨminі͡a četə sɨr            kobtaɁa-mə       təi-ču.

not obligatorily appear on the possessed entity, as in (48a–b).(48) a. ŋanuə sʲigiɁə.

              ChND_99_Fire_flkd.0024.2      Transitive Construction
A transitive verb honsɨ ‘have’ can also express a possessive relation. In these
constructions, the possessor is the grammatical subject and the possessed NP,
the direct object of the sentence and as such, appears in the accusative. The
verb must agree with the subject, i.e. the possessor, in number and person.
The possessor can be omitted from the sentence as in sentence (50), since the
personal verbal ending already refers to person. Thus, if the possessor can be
referred to by a pronoun, it is usually not overt in the sentence. (This is a pro-
drop phenomenon in a possessive construction.) The possessed does not have
to take on a possessive personal ending.

possessor or the possessed. During the elicitation, speakers produce both con-
structions and declare them fully synonymous and interchangeable. It should
be noted, however, that in spontaneous texts (both narrative and folklore) the
existential construction is more frequent.(51) a. mənə təi-ču           ańikaɁa kümaa-mə.

              JSM_080212_ Relationship2_flkd.059On the other hand, the present participle of the verb honsɨ is also frequent in
spontaneous texts, as in sentences (52a–b). As can be seen in this example, the
participial form of the have-verb is in the predicate position, so the construc-
tion structurally is a non-verbal predicate.

              MVL_09ß007_Hungabtadja_flks.671The verb ŋuðasa ‘own’ also expresses possession. This verb can be used to
express an inalienable possessive relation. The relation between the possessor
and the possessed is stable in time and the possessor controls the relation, i.e.
[+stable time] and [+control] features can be associated with this relation. The
possessor functions as the subject, while the possessed is the direct object in
the accusative. This structure emphasizes the existence of the possessive rela-
tion. Such sentences are considerably rarer than the previous type; there is only
one example for this construction in the corpus. The following two sentences
show the usage of this verb.(53) a. mənə səďəə-mtɨɁ         ŋuða-tu-m.

         chapter 10Simple SentencesSentences are generally grouped into two categories according to the way in
which the relationship to the predicate is expressed namely: simple or com-
plex sentences. This chapter deals with simple sentences.
   The syntax of Nganasan has not been thoroughly explored. There are only
few works that have dealt with syntactic problems. In her monographic work
dedicated to the syntax of Samoyedic languages (1973), Tereschenko only enu-
merates the types of sentences which exist. In a grammar of Nganasan by the
same author (1979), semantic and syntactic issues are not considered at all. The
summary below highlights and discusses the most important questions, but it
is not an exhaustive account.
   Nganasan is a head-final SOV language; however, head-finality is not rigid.
Word order is basically determined by the information structure of the sen-
tence (for more detail see in Chapter 14). Head-finality is obligatory in phrases
containing a noun, such as possessive phrases (head: noun) and postpositional
phrases (head: postposition). Contrarily, in attributive phrases the adjective
can follow the head noun (cf. Section 1 in Chapter 8). Question words tend to
appear at the beginning of the sentence, but they sometimes occur in a more
internal position (see Section 2.2.2 below).
   The most important grammatical relations are easily discovered in a sen-
tence, as these are morphologically marked. An overt subject is not a com-
pulsory element of a sentence; according to Holmberg’s terminology (2005)
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language. There are no general pronouns
(like one in English or si in Italian) in Nganasan.
   Nganasan is an accusative-nominative language, as the unmarked element
in an active sentence is the subject and the agent. However, the object may be
unmarked as well, if it is in a third person pronoun as the inflectional suffixes
can refer to a third person object. Thus Nganasan in not only a subject pro-
drop, but also an object pro-drop language. The personal pronouns have the
same form in the role of an object and subject. (For information about the flex-
ion of personal pronouns see Section 4.1 in Chapter 3, for object marking see
Section 1.2 below).

The meaning of this emphatic pronoun is something like ‘I/you … could also
do it for sure’. Generally, these forms appear in answers or in sentences which
are reactions to a previous statement (see sentences 46a and 46b). A special
characteristic of this form is that the stem vowel is lengthened.

use it and do not recognize it. It occurred in elicited sentences, but in texts by
only two older speakers, KTD’s and MVL’s. This speaker’s generation typically
acquired Nganasan as their L1 and either did not learn Russian at all, or spoke a

as TNK, are familiar with these forms, but do not use them in their speech. The

Some of the possessive suffixes can be used in non-possessive functions as
well: the 2sg, 3sg, 1pl and 3pl suffixes. The use of these four suffixes is briefly
described below.
   The possessive suffix 3sg (-TU) is often attached to mark the definiteness of
celestial bodies and natural phenomena (ŋuǝ ‘sky’, kou ‘sun’, məu ‘earth’ etc.),
but the denoted entity must be a planet or it must be topicalized.4 If the word
remains in topic position, it is marked by a possessive suffix (54a), otherwise
not (54b).(54) a. kou-ðu          ŋǝðu-tɨ,             ŋǝtu-m-hi͡atɨ.

                MDN_97_TwoBirds_flkd.012Some possessive suffixes, such as 1plposs, 3sgposs and 2sgposs can also be
used in an identificatory function (anaphoric use) in narrative texts. They mark4 In contrast to Nenets, other unique natural phenomena such as ŋuǝ ‘sky’, mǝu ‘earth’ etc. are
  not necessary determined by the possessive suffix. (For Nenets, see Nikolaeva 2014: 68.)

           PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.140–141Third person plural possessive suffixes have a selective function as well. If the
speaker selects an element from a group, a possessive ending is attached to the
name of the element. The possessive suffix refers to the group.(56) meńďaďə ‘new’          →    meńďaďə-ðuŋ ‘the new one’

           ChND_080729_SevenNjote_flks.0755       DestinativeThere is a destinative marker in all Northern Samoyedic languages (Enets,
Nenets and Nganasan), which can only attach to nouns. If a noun is inflected
in the destinative (dst), this means that the person denoted by the noun
will get something or s/he is going to be the beneficiary (recipient) of the
action. So, the NP in question is usually a recipient-like argument of the sen-
tence.

viding descriptions have regarded it as one declension class (cf. Prokof’jev 1937,
Tereshchenko 1966, 1979, among others), but they state very little about its exact
behaviour as regards its morphology. Below the actual morphological and syn-
tactic behaviour of forms marked with the destinative suffix is described. The

The auxiliary kasaďa with the meaning ‘almost, nearly’ was described in tradi-
tional descriptions (Tereshchenko 1979: 261, Wagner-Nagy 2002: 151) as a nega-
tive auxiliary, but actually it carries no negative meaning (see also Gusev 2015:
128). The auxiliary is followed by the connegative form of the main verb. It
can be conjugated in all conjugation types. Sentence (7b) shows the verb in
reflexive conjugation, sentence (7a) in the subjective, and (7c) in the objective
conjugation.(7) a. tahari͡a munu-munu-ču: kaj, tǝti kasa-Ɂa-m        ŋǝnǝbta-Ɂ.

sentence for connegative forms, i.e. it cannot appear as a main verb in a nega-
tive phrase. Examples with a derivational suffix are sporadic. As sentence (7b)
above shows, the lexical verb normally takes the passive marker. However, the
auxiliary can also take, for example, the passive suffix, which can even be fol-
lowed by inflectional suffixes, and the lexical verb can also take a derivational
suffix. This is shown by sentence (9).(8) təndɨ-čə         ɨsɨəbüə kasa-ďüə-Ɂ        mənə ŋüü  ďa sarə-Ɂ.

           TKF_99_TwoShamans_flkd.161The particle kasaɁ ‘nearly, all but’ is associated with the auxiliary, as exempli-
fied in Section 8.2 below.3.3.2       ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly, be unable’
The auxiliary ləðiʔsʲ can be classified as a type of negative auxiliary and trans-
lated as ‘cannot, be unable’, which is followed by the connegative form of the
main verb. The auxiliary is imperfective and occurs only with imperfective
verbs. It can take derivational suffixes (10b), tense markers (10c), and can be
inflected in the subjective (10a), reflexive (10d), and objective (10e) conjuga-
tion. Which conjugation is used depends on what conjugation the verb would
be in, if not in a construction involving an auxiliary. The use of conjugations
is discussed in Section 1, Chapter 9. The following examples demonstrate the
usage of the auxiliary. The opposite of this verb is the verb tukəďa ‘be able’, an
example is given in (11c) below.(10) a. mənə təɁ            təbtə ləði-ti-m     ńilɨ=əi-Ɂ!

              ASS_161023_Djajku1_flkd.0143.3.3       əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’
The auxiliary əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’ behaves like the imperfective verbs,
but its paradigm is defective. It does not have an infinitive form, and does not
take tense or mood markers. Unlike kasaďa ‘almost, nearly’ and ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly,
be unable’, this auxiliary takes the sentence final position, thus the main verb in
the connegative form precedes it. It is peculiar in that it assimilates to the lexi-
cal verb in terms of suffix alternation. (For information about suffix alternation
see Section 7.2 in Chapter 2.) It can be safely assumed that it evolved from the
particle əku (see Section 12.2 below). Thus, in principle, a process of lexical-
ization and not of grammaticalization can be observed. The auxiliary can be
conjugated by all conjugation types. The usage of the auxiliary is illustrated by
the sentences below.(11) a. mənə kačəmə-hu͡aðəə, kəči       mənə ńimsʲa-sɨəďəə-mə təibə-Ɂ

              TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.2323.3.4       ŋuəlɨ- ‘how can I not; of course’
The auxiliary ŋuǝlɨ- means something like ‘of course, how can you think I/you/
he will not; how could I/you/he not’. The majority of descriptions referred to
ŋuəlɨ- as a monomorphemic verbal stem (Tereshchenko 1979: 261; Katzsch-
mann 1993–1994: 58), but in my opinion, the stem of the word is ŋuə-, which
is followed by the dubitative suffix -lɨ- and the personal marker (for dubitative
see Chapter 5, Section 5.11). It is possible that the stem is related to the particle
ŋuəlɨ ‘of course, naturally’ particle, but the direction of the evolution process
cannot be determined. The meaning of the stem ŋuə- is not absolutely clear, but
the S2 stem of the BE verb (i-sʲa) is also ŋuə-. Therefore, it is possible that the
dubitative form of the BE verb was grammaticalized as an auxiliary. However,
this supposition needs to be tested further.
    This auxiliary is always followed by the connegative form of a lexical verb,
which suggests that ŋuəlɨ- is an auxiliary whose infinitive form does not ap-
pear among the data. This means, this is an auxiliary with a defective paradigm.
Although, there is very little data available with the ŋuəlɨ- auxiliary, but it is un-
derstood that, ŋuǝlɨ- can be conjugated in all conjugation types, though it never
combines with the aorist marker (-NTA or -Ɂə, see Section 4.1 in Chapter 5) or
other tense markers. This auxiliary cannot take derivational suffixes, but em-
phatic suffixes do attach to it, as sentence (12a) illustrates. There are however
only very few examples for this available. There are examples for the auxiliary
conjugated in the subjective (12a–b), objective (12d) and reflexive (12c).(12) a. tə mənə ďeðɨka-Ɂa i-sʲa, maa bən-ə

The verb konɨďi with the meaning ‘go away’ is also used as an auxiliary in
resultative and translative clauses with the meaning ‘to become something,
to change to’. It appears with nouns as well as with adjectives and numerals.
The auxiliary is obligatorily preceded by a nominal part of the construction
and the infinitive form of the BE verb isʲa. In interrogative sentences, the aux-
iliary takes the interrogative marker as in (13b). For detailed description on the
essive-translative construction see Szeverényi & Wagner-Nagy 2017a.(13) a. tə         baaðə tətɨ turku tǝrǝɁ ńimti i-sʲa kona-Ɂa

           KVB_97_EvilSpirit.0274       Pronominal ItemsNganasan has personal, interrogative, demonstrative pronouns and intensi-
fiers. Human beings are referred by personal pronouns, while animals, plants
and objects by demonstratives. There are no dedicated possessive pronouns;
this is expressed using personal pronouns (see Section 4.1.7). Indefinites are
derived from question words using the -küə/-güə, -čə clitic-like morphemes (see
Section 7.3 and Chapter 16). There are no special negative pronouns, the ques-
tion words with the emphatic clitic -kəlʲičə/ -gəlʲičə may be treated as negative
polarity items (see Section 4.6 below). Neither relative, nor reflexive pronouns
are present. The reflexive or reciprocal meaning is covered by the word hütəðə
‘body’, by the word ńa ‘companion, friend’ with the possessive suffix, and by
the word sɨɁ ‘image of living things’ marked for the relevant personal posses-
sive suffix (15). If in this kind of sentences the intensifier ŋonə- appears, it has
an emphatic intensified meaning. Another possibility for expressing a reflexive
situation is the usage of reflexive conjugation; cf. Section 3.3 in Chapter 5.(15) a. ďerutu-mi     ńa-ńi.

              ChND, 20094.1       Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns can only refer to humans, animals and plants, while objects
are referred to by demonstrative pronouns, but occasionally demonstratives
refer to humans as in sentence (17c). There is no gender distinction.
    All three numbers (sg, du, pl) and each person has a corresponding per-
sonal pronouns, making nine personal pronouns altogether. Special honorific
forms (such as Hungarian ön, or the use of plural forms in this function, as
in German Sie (3pl) or Russian Vy (2pl)) do not exist, however there are few
examples for the use of 2pl personal pronoun in this function. This is obviously
due to Russian influence.
    The behaviour of personal pronouns is the most noteworthy aspect of pro-
nouns. Although they cannot be inflected in the way other nominal categories
can, several emphatic clitic-like suffixes can be attached (cf. Section 4.1.4).
These emphatic markers may attach to other pronouns as well.
    The 3sg, 3du and 3pl forms of personal pronouns are derived from the noun
sɨʔ ‘portrayal, picture, image (of living things)’ followed by corresponding pos-
sessive suffixes. The forms are shown below:(16) Personal pronouns              sg            du                      pl1st person mənə ‘I’       mii ‘the two of us’    mɨŋ ‘we’
2nd person tənə ‘you’     tii ‘the two of you’   tɨŋ ‘you’
3rd person sɨtɨ ‘she, he’ sɨti ‘the two of them’ sɨtɨŋ ‘they’
Personal pronouns most often function as the subject of a sentence. If the
pronoun is the subject,—Nganasan being a consistent null-subject language—
it is only optional; the verb inflection replaces the pronouns. Overt personal
pronouns are only used in contexts where they have special discourse signifi-
cance, such as emphasis. Sentence (17a) is an example with an overt pronoun
in the subject position, while in sentence (17b) only the verbal ending refers
to the number and person of the subject. (More about this topic see in Chap-
ter 9). To the 3rd person humane referent in subject position can refer to the

person possessive suffix. Some speaker use instead the anaphoric demonstra-
tive the distant deictic pronoun takəə ‘that’. The exact distribution between
these forms regard further investigation.(17) a. tənə takəə i-čü-ŋ,        ŋamtü-čə      ŋəðu-tɨ-Ɂ.

              ChND, 2008Personal pronouns can also serve as direct objects, but unlike to other Samo-
yedic languages, they not have inflected forms. Presently, the accusative and the
genitive forms are identical to the nominative form. Older speakers still tend to
use the former suffixes, especially in the accusative case (-m), however there are
only very few examples for this phenomenon. In the speech of younger speaker
the inflected forms never appear. Sentence (18a) illustrates a personal pronoun
in object position with the accusative suffix, while sentences (18b–c) depict a
personal pronoun without the case marker.(18) a. mənə-m kəmə-ŋəə=u.

"3.1       Existential Clause
Of the Samoyedic languages, Nganasan offers the widest range of possibilities
concerning which existential sentences can be formed, namely, with or with-
out copulas. In the existential constructions both existential copulas are used.
One is used to express existence in a place, thus this kind of sentences normally
has a locative (coda), while the other is used to express abstract existence or to
make a general statement. In the latter case, as can be seen below, a locative
element never occurs in the sentence.
    The existential verb təisʲa ‘exist, be’ appears most often in existential clauses.
It is just as frequent in possessive constructions, but—as described in Section
4.1 below—these two constructions resemble each other in other respects as
well. This verb can take tense markers, so it can be used in past and future
as well, as in sentence (36b) below. The word order in sentences is coda–

                 PED_041206_MyLife_nar.11The existential verb tənijsʲa ‘exist, be there’ is used less frequently than təisʲa.
The existent data indicates that this construction can be used only in sentences
expressing a general statement or abstract existence.(37) a. ŋunɨrɨ-Ɂɨa              ma-Ɂa      tənіj-hu͡aŋhu.

the coda is expressed, it takes the first position, thus the word order is coda—

word order is the same as in existential sentences, but in which the BE verb
(isʲa) is used, rather than one of the two existential verbs, as in (39).(39) təndə      ma-tənu ŋuə-lʲaa tɨbɨjki͡a i-ču.

           KNT_940903_KehyLuu.011Copulaless existential sentences are far less frequent than those with a copula.
As shown in the following example, these sentences can be formed without a
verb form of any kind. This kind of construction appears in tales as one of the
introductory sentences.(40) təndə     kuəďə ńi-ni             ŋuɁəj maɁ.
     this.gen hill.gen on-adv.loc one tent
     ‘On this hill (there is) a tent.’
           JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.004The constituent order in this kind of existential sentences is coda—pivot.
This, of course, does not allow for any speculations as to where the copula
would be, if there were one. This structure is probably used due to Russian influ-
ence. As for existential clauses in Russian, the word order is coda–(copula)–
pivot. The emergence of a parallel structure underpins the suggestion that
word order changes due to the influence of Russian. In any case, it must be
noted that this way of forming existential sentences is far less frequent than
the two other types presented above, and it only appears in narrative texts.
   The pivot of existential sentences can be modified with numerals (number
determiners), number marking (in case of Nganasan, the plural and the dual)
and with quantifiers. Sentence (41a) below shows that a numeral can modify a
pivot without making it definite. The same is true for number marking, illus-
trated in (41b).(41) a. təndə     ma-tənu četə-ri͡aa ŋanaɁsa təi-ču.

In a locative sentence, the existential verb introduced above (tǝisʲa) can occur,
but regularly it is the BE-verb (isʲa). In locative clauses, the word order is
pivot—coda—copula, but in elicited sentences pivot—copula—coda
was also accepted and used by native speakers, although in texts it appears less
frequently. Sentence (42) is an example with the verb isʲa ‘be’, while in sentence
(43) the speaker uses the existential verb tǝisʲa. In this sentence, the location is
not specifically mentioned.(42)        pivot                                     coda     copula

            KTD_NN_SeuMelangana_flks.1149In a locative sentence the pivot must be definite. Demonstratives express def-
initeness, as in sentence (42) above the demonstrative təti ‘that’ specifies the
pivot. Possessive suffixes can express a real possessive relation as well, and
make the entity definite, as in sentence (43) the 2nd person possessive suffix
-rə which attaches to the word ‘sledge’. A noun may also lack explicit marking.
In that case, the pivot does not carry any possessive suffix nor is it preceded by
a demonstrative pronoun; the interpretation of the pivot as [+definite] is only
based on word order and the choice of the copula. The following sentences
show such unmarked noun phrases in the pivot role. Both pivot–coda–
copula and pivot–copula–coda order can be used, however the copula
coda word order is not common in the corpus, but it appears in elicited data. It
is probably a Russian influence. Indeed, in a locative sentence, the pivot always
precedes the coda.

common. In sentence (45b), the pivot is covert, the speakers use the copula

not obligatory overt. One of the verbs has special meaning, ‘eat uncooked/raw’.
The object is normally not overt, but is mentioned in the previous sentences.
It refers to fish or meat (46a). There are some derived verbs expressing ‘eating’
and ‘drinking’ which are built with the help of the denominal derivations suf-
fix -ir attached to names of foods and drinks. (For this suffix see Section 6.3.1 in

  4.1.3        Comparative Forms of Personal Pronouns
  If in an equality sentence the compared entity is referred to by a pronoun, it is
  expressed by a derived form of the postposition na ‘to, towards’ or with mantə
  ‘like, similar’. If the construction is formed with the postposition na, the simila-
  tivesuffix (-RəKU) is followed by the nominative form of the possessive suffix
  that refers to the appropriate person. It is, however, the oblique forms of pos-
  sessive personal suffixes that connect to the postposition mantə. Both forms
  are listed in Table 3.1.
      In an equative sentence, the forms with the postposition na and -RəKU can
  appear without the personal pronoun, while the postposition mantǝ is always
  preceded by the pronoun.  (29) a. na-rəgu-mə       ńaa          təɁ.

  be covert and indicated only verbal ending attached to the predicate (verb or

               PED_080731_Competition_nar.4544.1.4       Special Forms of Personal Pronouns
There are special forms for emphatic personal pronouns. Emphatic clitics can
connect only to these, just like some derivational suffixes. The special stems of
pronouns never appear on their own, only in suffixed form. The stem is followed
by an emphatic suffix (cf. Section 7, in Chapter 16) and the oblique case form of
the possessive suffix. The special stem ends in a -ń consonant, which although
it does not appear overtly, initiates palatalization and nasalization (cf. Section
7.4 in Chapter 2). In third person forms, the special stem has two versions. In
the sections below, which stem is used for the given pronoun form is always
indicated. Table 3.2 shows the special stems and the structure of the personal
pronouns.
    Below is an overview of the forms of personal pronouns derived with the
limitative suffix as well as with the various emphatic suffixes.

Personal pronouns have a limitative form, which is formed from the spe-
cial pronominal stem and the limitative suffix -RA1a (-rɨa, -raa, -lʲia) ‘only’.
The limitative suffix is always followed by the possessive suffix attaching to
oblique cases. In third person, only the sɨń- stem is used. The forms are given
in (31):
(31)            Singular      Dual       Plural       1person mɨ-lʲia-nə mɨ-lʲia-ni mɨ-lʲia-nɨɁ

       3person sɨ-lʲia-tɨ sɨ-lʲia-ti sɨ-lʲia-tɨŋ
These forms are found only in subject position. Their usage is illustrated by the
following sentences.(32) a. mɨ-lʲia-nɨɁ          buə-gə-tu-mɨɁ    ńaaďətə-ďa, …

              KES_031115_Paris_nar.2244.1.6       Personal Pronouns with Emphatic Morphemes
Emphatic pronouns are different from intensifiers (cf. Section 4.3 below) both
in their form and their meaning. Formally they are similar to limitative forms.
The meaning of these forms is rather vague and consequently very difficult
to translate. They cannot be translated by words like ‘himself/herself’ as in
the sentence ‘He himself opened the tin.’, rather a personal pronoun plus an
extra emphatic word or structure can give their meaning in another language.
Emphatic pronouns have several forms. As can be seen the following exam-
ples, more than one emphatic clitic can attach to pronominal stems, but their
ordering is strict, and only some of them—as -sʲiə, -btə, -cčə, -bülʲa, -Küə and
-Kücmü—attach to other emphatic morphemes, whereas the other suffixes
occur only by themselves. The suffixes that can connect with each other can
116                                                                  chapter 3occur only in particular slots, and suffixes that occur in the same slot cannot
connect to each other. As can be seen in Figure 3.1, the suffix -KüCmü always
occurs in the position immediately before the possessive suffix.       ⎧ bülja ⎫ ⎧ Küə ⎫

The meaning of this form is ‘it was X and not someone else’ or something like
‘well, anyway’. In third person, only the sɨń- stem is used. In the texts, exam-
ples of only the first and second person forms have been found, meaning that
all third person forms have been elicited from native speakers and checked by
other native speakers. The most frequently occurring forms are the 2sg and
2pl forms (each making up 30% of all forms), followed by the 1sg form (25 %
of the total), although such forms occur only in 0.3 % of all sentences in the
corpus.
    As chart (33) reflects, singular forms do not vary, whereas du and pl forms
have two or more variants in the texts. The i ~ ü alternation is in harmony with
the rules of vowel alternation (see Section 7.7.2 in Chapter 2). The 2du form
ending -ndi and the 2pl form -nt does not conform to the rules of consonant
gradation (cf. Section 7.1. in Chapter 2.), but they are used.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135]"
"1.2.1      NP in Object Position
As mentioned in Section 3, Chapter 4, the ancient accusative case marker (-m)
in singular has disappeared, thus in singular the accusative, genitive and the
simple sentences                                                           373nominative forms are mostly identical (23a–b). However, if the noun contains
a gradation consonant, the consonant gradation displays the accusative case
as in sentence (24a), in which the accusative form of the word bahi ‘wild rein-
deer’ appears. Sentence (24b) contains the accusative form of the word bigaj
‘river’. The following phonological processes have taken place: biKaj + ə +m >
bi.ka.jəm (opening of the syllable) > bi.ka.jam (assimilation of the epenthetic
vowel) > bi.ka.am (historical consonant deletion in intervocalic position) >
bikaa. Thus, the form of the word shows that it is not in nominative, but in
accusative. (For the morphophonological processes see Chapter 2: Gradation
is described in Section 7.1, assimilation in Section 7.3, while consonant dele-
tion in Section 7.6.)(23) a. biiɁ kanə-güə                taa            mi-sʲiə-m.

If a personal pronoun takes the object position, there is no case marking on
it, because personal pronouns do not have any inflectional forms (cf. Section
4.1 in Chapter 3). Nganasan being a pro-drop language, the subject expressed
with personal pronoun is only seldom overt in a sentence, thus if a personal
pronoun appears in the sentence, it mostly plays the object role as in sentence
(27a) below, the subject is indicated by the verbal ending. The verbal agreement
shows the person and number of the subject. If the subject is emphasized, it
appears in the sentence. In this case, the word order is SOV, thus the subject
takes the first position and additionally the agreement clarifies which personal
pronoun takes which role as shown in sentence (27b).(27) a. tənə       ŋəðə-tə-ndu-m.

noun or a demonstrative pronoun used in the function of personal pronoun,
hoewever the third person personal pronoun never occur in object position. In
the case of the latter, the pronoun is marked for the accusative, as in sentences
(28) and (29a). In elicited examples, the consultants accepted the personal pro-
noun in the object position, but they gave the demonstrative pronoun as a
possible variant as well. If the object is a null-pronoun, the verb is always con-
jugated by the objective conjugation as in sentence (29b).

               ChND-KES_061107_Berizenaa_flkd.082It can be stated that the third person personal pronoun does not appear in
the object position, because the conjugation reflects the object, but the non-
first personal objects are present. (For more information about the pronoun
in object position see Wratil 2013; for the usage of the objective and subjective
conjugation see Section 1 in Chapter 9.)1.2.3       Predestinative Object
The object can be marked for predestinativity as well. In this case, the object
contains the destinative suffix (-Tə), followed by the ancient accusative end-
ing (-m) and possessive suffix. The possessive suffix denotes the beneficiary or
recipient. If the destinative suffix takes on the theme of the ditransitive con-
struction (direct object), as the examples below depict, the recipient or benefi-
ciary does not obligatorily need to be expressed by lexical means, the possessive
suffix denotes it. In sentence (32a) the recipient is in the first-person singular,
and expressed by the possessive suffix (-mǝ), while in sentence (32b) it is in the
second person singular, and expressed by the possessive suffix (-rǝ).(32) a. təgətə ma-tə-mə                  melɨsɨj-ki-Ɂə-m.

               ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.0981.2.4      Direct Object in Imperative Sentences
In imperative sentences the direct object usually occurs in the nominative, if
the verb is in 2sg or 2pl imperative form. This is typical not only for Ngana-
san, but for some other Uralic languages as well, as Finnish or Nenets. (For
Nenets see Janhunen 2002). From the present data, in imperative sentences,
the accusative case marking is generally preserved; only the 2sg subjective

ative there is a variation: there are examples where the object is nominative
(33b), but cases have also been found where it is marked for accusative (33c).
The sentences below illustrate the shape of the object in imperative sentences.
The selected example sentences mostly have an object with a possessive suffix,
in these cases the nominative and the accusative cases are clearly different.(33) a. … əmə       bɨnɨ-mənɨ bakaðəə-rə  hu͡anə-Ɂ.

Adjuncts are typically adverbials expressed by adverbs, nominal categories
with an adverbial inflection or with a postposition, or rarely bar nouns such
as talu ‘yesterday, tomorrow’ (35a). Furthermore, an infinitive can also func-
tion as an adverbial of manner. Adjuncts are optional constituents of a sen-
tence. Locality, direction movement, place of destination, starting point of
movement, path (spatial adjuncts) and temporal relation can be expressed by
adverbials, a nominal category with a case inflection (35b) or by postpositional
phrases. Time and place adverbials tend to appear in sentence or clause initial
positions (35a and 36a). If there are two adverbials in a sentence, normally the
time adverbial appears in the clause-initial position.(35) a. {talu}     tahari͡aa büü-gü-ŋ

"7.1       Exclamative
The exclamative clitics -əɨ, -əu, -uɁ attach to vowel final and consonant final
stems in different ways: it follows vowel-final stems, e.g. barusʲi-əi ‘hey, witch’,
but it is inserted before the stem-final consonant, as in ďujkələ-Ɂ > ďujkəl-əu-Ɂ
‘screw it in please!’; konɨ-gu-ðəm ‘let me go’ > konɨ-gu-ð-əu-m ‘let me go finally!’.
The suffix vowels are pronounced long and there is a rise-fall intonation con-
tour on the morpheme. As the sentences below demonstrate, it can attach to
540                                                                    chapter 16all word categories; however, it occurs most frequently with nouns. Example
sentences suggest that suffix harmony is not applied in all cases. The clitic
expresses the exclamative meaning, but it can mark unexpected information
too, thus, it has a mirative usage as well. In this case, it conveys surprise, as in
sentence (54).(54) a. tə, … barusʲi-əi, ŋonəi-Ɂ         basaď-əu-Ɂ.

              TKF_031117_ThreeBrothers_flk.1407.2       Suffix -ŋUTU
The suffix has a meaning ‘finally, definitely, well’. As determined by suffix alter-
nation and gradation rules, the forms of this clitic are -ŋɨtɨ, -ŋutu, -ŋɨðɨ or
-ŋuðu. When attached to a nominal category, this emphatic clitic appears after
the derivational suffixes and possessive morphemes, but before the number
marker, e.g. ńaagəə ‘good’ > ńagəə-ŋutu ‘definitely good’; tibɨjki͡aɁku ‘little boy’

Tis morphemes occurs very frequently and most often attaches to nominal
categories or infinitives. It has the meaning ‘all right’ and it, e.g. bɨɁ ‘water’ >
bɨküə ‘water all right’, ŋomtǝďa ‘sit down’ > ŋomtǝ-güǝ-ďa, ‘all right sit down’

or case suffix as sentence (58b) demonstrates. When attached to a verbal stem,
inflections, mood markers, and the aorist marker for imperfective verbs fol-
low it, as in ďüŋar-küə-tü-Ɂ ‘they are noisy’; helɨðɨ-küə-tə-ndɨ-m ‘I am willing
to help you/him/her’. However, the aorist marker for perfective verbs precedes
this clitic, as in sentence (58d). The pre-infinitival position may signal that it has
reached such a stage of grammaticalization that it can be considered a deriva-
tional suffix.(58) a. ŋomtə-güə-ďa,          ŋomtə-bаðа-Ɂ,

This is a frequently occurring morpheme which is generally attached to nom-
inal categories before the possessive or case suffix, but occasionally it appears
on verbs after derivational suffixes or before the infinitive suffix. This suffix can
attach to the special pronominal stems as well (cf. Section 4.1.4, in Chapter 3).
If the suffix attaches to the nominal stem, derivational suffixes can precede
it. Examples: ďeŋkuj ‘trap’ > ďeŋguj-kümü-mə ‘well my trap’; maðə-Ɂə ‘big tent’
[aug] > maðə-Ɂə-gümü ‘well big tent’. Sentences (60a–b) show the suffix used
with a nominal stem, while sentence (61) is an example of a verbal stem.(60) a. kaði͡au, əmtɨ kuhu-gümü-mə                  ńiə-bi-nə

When attached to a nominal category, the emphatic clitic-like suffix -ŋalə
(-ŋi͡alǝ) appears before the destinative and possessive suffix and has an em-
phatic meaning ‘even’, cf. sentence (62a). This suffix precedes the case endings
and number marking suffixes. This means that, based on how it behaves mor-

to a clitics.(62) a. tahari͡a kurəgu-ndiɁ    ŋanuə-mənɨ hunsəə

the perfective aorist marker and the person marker, as sentence (63a) shows,
but precedes the imperfective aorist marker (63b). The common tense and
mood markers such as past or future follow the suffix -ŋalə (63c). But there
are also examples where it is followed by a derivational suffix. Sentence (63b)
demonstrates a case in which the iterative derivational suffix is placed follow-
ing -ŋalə, while in sentence (63a) the resultative suffix precedes it. The example
sentences show that in this sense there is no vacillation in this respect: the itera-
tive suffix always occurs after the clitic-like morpheme in every case, regardless
of the speaker.(63) a. četu͡a ǝrǝkǝrǝ-mǝnɨ ńiibta-Ɂa-mi, ŋǝmǝ-Ɂki-Ɂǝ-ŋalǝ-mi.

This suffix is prominently used as an emphasizing element in negative sen-
tences, though it alone does not express negation. It sometimes occurs in affir-
mative sentences, but only very rarely, and when it is the case, it only has an
emphasizing role (64b). This morpheme can be preceded by other clitic-like
morphemes and derivational suffixes and is followed by inflectional suffixes.(64) a. təti kəi-mənɨ-ntɨ               hеðɨtɨ-sɨ, mаа mənə ŋuɁəð-ə

pheme is attached to the lexical verb, followed by the connegative form, as in
(65a). In an affirmative sentence, it is placed before the person marker. Both
aorist markers precede it (65a), but all tense and mood markers follow it (65c).

         chapter 17Text SamplesThe two texts presented here were recorded during fieldwork. The first text
is a biographical narrative from a fully bilingual speaker. The second text is a
folklore text recorded from a trilingual (Nganasan-Enets-Russian) speaker. The
texts are presented in several tiers. The first tier is the standard phonological
transcription. The second line gives the morpheme-by-morpheme form. The
third line provides the glossing for the previous tier. The forth line provides the
English translation. Russian loans and code switches are bolded in the first line.
Additionally, the text is also rendered in the Cyrillic orthography.","[558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567]"
"1.1     Subject
As stated above, Nganasan belongs to the nominative–accusative languages.
Therefore, the overt subject of an intransitive and a transitive active sentence
gets the same case marker, namely the nominative case in clauses with finite
verb and with non-verbal predicate as well. There is no distinction between an
agentive and a non-agentive subject or human and non-human subject. The
predicate must agree in person and number with the subject (see Section 1.1.1
below). The grammatical subject of the sentence tends to appear in the sen-
tence initial position, but adverbs and question words can precede it. Typical
subjects are expressed by a nominal phrase, which is composed of a modified
noun (1a), a simple noun, (1b) or a pronoun (1c).(1) a. {təti ŋi͡antu-rə}          ma-tə-tu

cases, these participles have been lexicalized as nouns expressing names of
professions (2). Sentence (3) shows a non-lexicalized present participle as the
subject.(2) {basu-tuə-mə}          tu-u-ʔə        əku.

           JDH_00_TwoDolganBrothers_flk.456Occasionally, a numeral plays the role of the subject. In such cases, the numeral
refers to the number of actors and the head of the phrase is elliptic.(4) a. {mǝtü-lʲaa-mǝ} kou-Ɂǝ-Ɂ.

              ChND_080729_SevenNjote_flks.09364% of all subjects are a pronominal subject, but pronouns in the subject role
are regularly in all tenses omitted, as their antecedent is referred to by personal
verbal suffixes. Only 19% of these are overt in the sentence. Nganasan allows
referential null subject (1b), generic null subject as well as expletive null subject
(8a–b). In the examples below, all the pronominal subjects are totally absent.
It means that they are phonetically null-subjects, but the hearer can identify
it on the verbal ending. The 1st person and 2nd person pronominal subjects
are dropped freely in any context. The 3rd person subject is generally dropped
when it is already expressed in an earlier sentence or when the speaker assumes
that the hearer already knows who s/he is talking about.

no contrast or topic-shift.
    The present form of the temporal-conditional converb (see Chapter 5, Sec-

conjugation). In such sentences, the converb form is an action noun rather than
an adverbial form. If the subject has a complement, such as an attributive adjec-
tive, it must appear before the subject and it takes a genitive case marker. This
word order is unusual, as the final position is occupied by the converb playing
the role of subject.(10) a. nəŋhuə məu-ntuɁ                    ləŋu-biɁ.

           ChND_061023_School_nar.047If the subject has a determiner as an NP with a sociative suffix (-səbtə) as in
sentences (14a–b), the verb agrees with the logical subject, thus it appears in
the dual or most often in the plural. If the subject is an NP in the comitative
case as in sentences (15a–b), only the head NP must agree with the verb. The
sociative suffix is of postpositional origin, some speakers still use the genitive
before it, as in sentence (14b).

              ChND_080729_SevenNjote_flks.373There is another possibility to express comitative meaning. In this construc-
tion one part of the logical subject is referred to only by a verbal ending, and
the other part is an NP with the comitative postposition nanu as in (16a). As
mentioned above in these cases, the verb agrees with the logical subjects. If
the speaker wants to stress that the subjects (agents) acted together, the predi-
cate must be in the dual or plural, depending on the number of actors. Sentence
(16a) is a sentence with a covert subject; only the verb ending shows the agent.
The use of plural is not possible in this case. Sentence (16b) shows an exam-
ple of the NP in the comitative case. In the sentence, the verb agrees with the
logical subject, thus it takes the dual as well.(16) a. čii-Ɂə-gəj        ńuə-ntɨ         nanu.

           ChND, 2008Nominal categories are generally in the singular after a numeral or other quan-
tifier (cf. Section 7.6 in Chapter 3). If the noun appears in the singular form
(after a numeral), the subject and the predicate agree grammatically, thus the
verb is in the singular (18), but if the noun remains in the dual form, the verb
agrees in number with the noun, as in sentence (19). After quantifiers such as
ŋukəgəə ‘many, much’, bǝnsǝ ‘all’ or numerals, the predicate agrees formally with
the subject, i.e. it appears in the singular (20).(18) tahari͡aa büübtar-tu     tərəďi kərutətu      məu-ntənu sʲiti maɁ

"3.1.3      Posteriority
Posteriority (before X happens, Y happens) is expressed through the abessive
participle -məTUmA1Ɂa. In this construction, the imperfective action noun
-NTU form of the existential verb (isʲa: iču) follows the participle form of the
main verb. The subject/agent can be expressed by a possessive suffix from the
oblique series following the lative suffix on the nominalized form of the BE-
verb as in sentence (23a) or it is an NP in genitive, which takes the position
before the abessive participle as in sentence (23b). In this latter case, the nom-
inalized form of the BE-verb does not take the possessive suffix.(23) a. {ŋənsu-mətɨmɨɁɨ͡a i-ču-tə-nə}                 Ibula

Purposive clauses describe the purpose for the action mentioned in the clause.
These sentences are formally not complex. They can be expressed in several
ways. Primarily, supine structures are used (cf. Section 6.3 in Chapter 5). Usu-
ally, the subject of the purposive clause is the same as the subject of the matrix
clause, but seldom structures appear with different subjects as well as in (26b).
The matrix clause normally precedes the supine clause, but a reverse order is
also possible (26c).
   The subject of the supine clause is marked by a possessive suffix of the
oblique series on the nominalized form as in (26a) or by NPs in the genitive
as in (26b). If there is no reference to a subject in the sentence, the predicate
refers to a general subject.
   The most often used purposive adverbial clauses are marked by the supine
-NA2Kə followed by a possessive suffix. The nominalized form holds the argu-
ment structure of the verb. If the subject of the matrix clause and the subject
of the purposive clause are different, the subject in the purposive clause takes
the lative marker as in (26c).(26) a. lʲansə-ðɨ-nʲə                    lətɨ-guə-m

              ChND_041212_Girl_flkd.171In the other purposive construction, the speaker uses the nominalized verbal
form with the supine marker -ɁsA2 (-Ɂsa, -Ɂsi͡a), which is followed by a posses-
sive suffix of the oblique series. The possessive suffix refers to the subject of
the construction. This construction is not very common. The purposive clause
is sentence-final, as sentences (27a–b) show.(27) a. bənsə mɨəðə-səbtə           kondu-Ɂ             kobtu͡a-mə,

              KES_080721_Disease_flkd.310With verbs of moving, the purposive clause is expressed by a simple infinitive
form. This structure can appear only with the same-subject. The infinitive nor-
mally precedes the finite verb form, but in some cases, it can follow the inflected
verb.

              ASS_161024_Life_nar.015Negative purposive meaning is built with the help of the negative supine
marker -mUŋgətə. In this structure, the subject is also marked by the posses-
sive suffix. The use of the negative supine is rare. Instead of a negative supine
marker, the speakers mostly use the supine form of the negative auxiliary as
(29b) shows. The two constructions are fully synonymous. The same speaker
can use both structures.(29) a. ďa-ðə-tu                  konɨ-ni͡agə-ŋuðu-tu          ńüu əhɨ

purposive clauses, although under Russian influence some people have begun
to use the Russian linking element štobɨ ‘in order’. It must be noted that this
kind of construction does not copy the Russian structure, only the linking ele-
ment appears in the Nganasan sentence, in the purposive clause the verb still
takes the supine ending.

Reason (or causal) clauses clarify why the described action or event happens.
There are two types of reason adverbial clause, although it must be stated that
this kind of sentences are very rare in the corpus. On the one hand, the matrix
and subordinate clauses can be linked without any conjunctions. In this case,
the verb of the subordinate clause appears in its infinitive form as in sentence
(31a). The predicate of the subordinate clause can as well be a non-verbal, as in
sentence (31b).(31) a. … ŋuəlɨ      kojmusa-Ɂa-ku-m-suəďəə-gümü

              ChND_080722_TwoFriends_flk.156On the other hand, two clauses can be linked together with a subordinator
as well. The conjunction suəbəsɨ ‘because’ and the grammaticalized phrase
təniɁi͡ajsʲa [təniɁi͡a ‘so’ + isʲa ‘be-inf’] with the meaning ‘for this reason’ can
mark the subordinated clause. The subordinator təniɁi͡ajsʲa always appears in
the matrix clause, with the subordinator (32), while the conjunction suəbəsɨ
introduces the subordinated clause (33).

A manner clause has the function of manner adverbs. These are formed with
the infinitive form of the main verb. It usually expresses simultaneous action
in time with the main clause as in the following sentences. The infinitive in
the manner clause retains its argument as in (34a) below. Normally, the man-
ner clause takes the sentence initial or finale position, but rarely it can be
embedded as well, as in sentence (34a) in which the sentential subject precedes
the manner clause. Occasionally, manner clauses have an additional temporal
meaning as well.(34) a. təti ńuə, {tahari͡aiɁ təndə-j      ŋamtə-j      kačəmə-sa}, məlʲi

Place adverbial clauses denote where the action described by the main verb
took place. The action noun -Ɂmuə/-Ɂmɨǝ is used to encode a non-finite loca-
tive relation. In this case, the nominalized form precedes the finite verb of the
matrix clause. This structure expresses anteriority, if the action noun takes the
nominal past marker (-ďǝǝ) as in (35a–b).(35) a. təndi-čə          tahari͡aa ńa-ntuŋ

Conditional sentences express hypothetical situations or implications. Accord-
ing to the degree of conditionality, there are two basic types of conditional
sentences. In the first type, both the main clause (matrix clause) and the sub-
clause express conditionality (double conditional: hypothetical or counterfac-
tual conditional). In the second sentence type, only the sub-clause is condi-
tional (simple conditional), the main clause does not express conditionality.
Conditional meaning can be expressed by a converb (nominalized verbal form:
-HÜɁ or -HÜɁnÜ) or through the irrealis mood (see Section 5.8 in Chapter 5).
In what follows, an overview of the simple conditional sentences is given with
a description of complex structure thereafter.","[460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467]"
"2.2     Dialects
Two dialects are distinguished, which do not differ significantly from each
other. Most speakers, almost 75 percent of Nganasan, use the Avam dialect,
which is primarily spoken in the western part of the Taimyr Peninsula. There

are two sub-dialects of the Avam dialect: Pyasina Avam, spoken in Usť-Avam
and Volochanka, and Taimyr Avam which is now only spoken in Volochanka.
Most descriptions are based on data from the Pyasina Avam sub-dialect. Speak-
ers living on the eastern side of the peninsula use the Vadeyev dialect. There are
no differences between women’s Nganasan and men’s Nganasan.
    Dialectal differences are typically phonetic and lexical. Research has only
revealed very few morphological differences between dialects, however it must
be pointed out that this aspect of Nganasan has not been studied in depth. In
the Pyasina sub-dialect, after the first person imperative form the ending -ðəm
is used while in the Taimyr dialect (mostly spoken in Volochanka) the ending of
the reflexive conjugation (-nə) is used. Compare the examples: huulʲə-ku-ðəm
vs. huu-lʲə-ku-nə [look.for-inch-imp-imp.1sg vs. look.for-inch-imp-1sg.rfl]
‘let me look for’. (For imperative see Section 5.2 in Chapter 5). Table 1.2 below
illustrates the phonetic and lexical differences of the dialects.","[33, 34]"
"2.5.2       Writing System in This Volume
Instead of the above described Cyrillic script, in this book, a phonological tran-
scription based on the letters of the Latin alphabet will be used. I mainly follow
the transcription principles of Helimski (1994a: 9–12), but my transcription is
slightly modified. I distinguish palatal and palatalized consonants. The follow-
ing letters are used:     Ɂ, ə, a, b, g, ď, d, ð, e, h, i, i͡a, ɨ, j, k, lʲ, l, m, n, ń, ŋ, o, r, s, sʲ, t, (ť) č, u, u͡a, üForeign words may also contain the graphemes: z, f, p, c, š.
   The phonological transcription in this book is based on the following prin-
ciples.
1. Each phoneme is marked by one grapheme and each grapheme corre-
      sponds to one phoneme.
2. Vowel length is marked by doubling the vowel letter: ńaa [ɲaː] ‘Nganasan’.
3. I do not mark the assimilation of vowels to each other: məu ‘earth’ and
      not *mou or *moo [moː]. The only exception is when a root ending in -a
      is followed by an ending that starts with a sequence -Ɂə (e.g. the augmen-
      tative suffix or the aorist marker). The assimilation of schwa is marked in
      writing: konaɁa ‘s/he went’ [konaɁa] or [konaː] and not *konaɁə.
4. The regressive assimilation of consonants (right to left palatalization) is
      marked in writing: bəńďəɁ ‘all [pl]’ [beɲɉeɁ] and not *bənďəɁ.
5. The letter ⟨e⟩ is only used in the first syllable of words. All syllables fol-
      lowing it have schwa instead of an ⟨e⟩: sʲejmɨčə ‘your eyes [acc]’ and not
      *sʲejmɨče.
22                                                                            chapter 16.   The sounds denoted by ť [c] and č [t͡ʃ ] occur in free variation in the lan-
     guage, thus either of them can be used in writing. In this volume, usually
     ⟨č⟩ is used.

3       Language Data3.1      Overview of Previous Works
The first attestations of the Nganasan language are relatively late. The first
word list, which sporadically contains some Nganasan material was compiled
by the English travelling merchant Richard James in 1618–1620. However, in
his notes James does not explicitly mention the Nganasans. Daniel Gottlieb
Messerschmidt (1685–1735) was the first to document words in the 18th cen-
tury. Not earlier than a century later, in 1823, this material was made avail-
able to the public in the work Asia Polyglotta by Julius Klapproth (1783–1835).
Also, a few Nganasan words can be found in the book Das Nord-Ostliche Theil
von Europa und Asia (1730) by the Swedish officer Philipp Johann Strahlen-
berg, who collected data from different languages during his time in exile in
Siberia. This work includes a comparative word list in which the words of the
languages are compared to corresponding lexemes of among others, the Hun-
garian language. Gerhard Friedrich Müller (1705–1783), the German scientist,
who led a scientific group on the second (great) Kamchatka expedition (1733–
1743) also collected, among historical and geographical materials, word lists and
24                                                                       chapter 1a few sentences from several Siberian languages including Nganasan. These
materials, except for the geographical and historical parts of his works, are
unfortunately still unpublished (see Helimski 2001). The polyglot vocabulary
Linguarum totius orbis vocabularia comparativa (1786–1789) compiled by Peter
Simon Pallas also includes some relevant language data. Word lists of different
length and comparative tables are included in his itineraries (1776). Pallas had
also used Müllers materials. All these data cannot or, only in a limited manner,
be used for linguistic analysis.
    The first systematic data collection was performed by the Finnish scholar
Matthias Alexander Castrén (1813–1852), the first prominent scholar of Samoye-
dology. Castrén made conducted expeditions among the Uralic peoples and
started investigating Samoyedic languages in 1842. His third field trip lasted
from 1845 to 1849. Although he spent only a few weeks on the Taimyr Penin-
sula, the Nganasan and Enets language material he collected during this time
is appreciated as an important milestone in the research of both languages. In
1849, health problems forced him to leave Siberia. Once home, he started sys-
tematizing the material collected, but his early death impeded the completion
of his work. His manuscripts were edited by Anton Schiefner. The work entitled
Nordische Reisen und Forschungen von M.A. Castrén appeared between 1853 and
1862 in 12 volumes. It includes a grammar of Samoyedic languages (1854) and
a Samoyedic vocabulary (1855). Schiefner has simplified the notation applied
in the manuscript and often refrained from indicating dialectal differences.
Nevertheless, the work is one of the most important sources in Samoyedol-
ogy.
    Castrén’s merit is highlighted by the fact that, for a long time, no progress has
been made in the studies on Nganasan. From the time after the Russian revo-
lution, only the short grammar by G.N. Prokofjev, published in 1937 is worth
mentioning. This grammar however does not represent substantial advance-
ment as it partly relies on the data discussed by Castrén.
    One of the most prominent researchers in the second half of the 20th cen-
tury was Natalya M. Tereshchenko (1908–1987), who was also an expert on the
two other Northern Samoyedic languages, Nenets and Enets. Tereshchenko’s
first noteworthy studies on the Nganasan language were published in the 1960s
(e.g. Tereshchenko 1966). Her monographic description from 1979 represents a
culmination and synthesis of her oeuvre. However, the fact that it completely
lacks a syntactic description represents a limitation of the monograph. This
also partly holds true for the phonological description.
    Between 1968 and 1972, several scholars from the Duľson School from Tomsk
have carried out fieldwork among the Nganasans and collected grammatical
data, word lists, and texts. Part of these texts were published in the series Skazki
introduction                                                                           25Narodov Severa (Tales of the Peoples of North Siberia, 1976, 1980, 1981), but a
good portion of these materials still have yet to be analysed and published.
   The Hungarian scholar Tibor Mikola (1936–2000) was the first to provide
modern linguistic descriptions based on his work with a speaker of Nganasan
in Leningrad in 1968. A very short grammatical sketch attached to the texts col-
lected was published in 1970.
   Substantial contributions to the study of the Nganasan language were made
by Eugen Helimski (1950–2007), whose work represents an important mile-
stone in modern studies. One of Helimski’s most significant achievements
was the description of the system of complex morphophonological rules such
as: syllabic gradation, rhythmical gradation, nunnation, and vowel harmony
(Helimski 1994a, 1995, 1998). This was an essential contribution to the descrip-
tion of the language, as the above-mentioned phenomena had only been briefly
dealt with in the previous literature.
   Even though several additional texts have been published since the publica-
tions of texts by Mikola, there is still little published text material available in
Nganasan. The collections edited by Kazis Labanauskas (1942–2002), who lived
in Dudinka for several decades are also noteworthy (1992, 2001). Labanauskas’
latest text collection (2001) was translated into German by Michael Katzsch-
mann. Based on these texts, Katzschmann compiled a grammatical description
of Nganasan (2008).
   The practical Nganasan-Russian-Nganasan dictionary, compiled by T. Ju.
Zhdanova with the help of two native speakers Nadezhda T. Kosterkina (1952–
2005) and Aleksander Ch. Momde (1945–2001), deserves special mention. This
difficult to access dictionary is a useful tool for language learners since it pro-
vides word base variants as well as additional morphophonological informa-
tion.
   In the 1980s, research on grammar intensified. Ekaterina Boľdt deals in her
monograph with nominal derivation (1989). Wagner-Nagy in her monograph
investigated word-formation in general (2001), and she compiled a text book
and short grammatical description in 2002, in which some essential point of
phonology, morphology and syntax were raised.
   Syntax is a less well investigated area; there are hardly any monographic
descriptions in this field. After Tereshchenko’s monograph on Samoyedic syn-
tax (1973) only the work of Kovalenko (1992) dealt with syntax.
   Recently Nganasan language corpora with interlinear glosses have also been
made available via the internet.77 In the project Typology of Negation in Ob-Ugric and Samoyedic languages (acronym: NOS,
  2008–2011) conducted at the University of Vienna two texts (of 583 sentences altogether)
26                                                                                 chapter 13.2       Language Data for This Study
In this grammar, fieldwork materials are analysed which were collected dur-
ing several field trips between 1937 and 2016. The transcripts are part of the
Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC), which has been created as part of
the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan project (supported by the
German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1) whose primary goal is to generate a dig-
ital, searchable corpus of spoken Nganasan. During fieldwork sessions, at least
two types of language data are collected: (1) elicited sentences aiming to clar-
ify grammatical or lexicological questions, (2) texts and songs. My fieldwork
materials, which are part of the corpus, consists of data collected during four
fieldwork trips, carried out in 1994, 1996, 2008, and 2016. Altogether, I spent four
months in Usť-Avam, and in Dudinka as well as working with language consul-
tants in Moscow.
   The grammatical description in this volume is based on language data from
the Avam dialect. It relies on existing grammatical descriptions (e.g. Teresh-
chenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.), language data derived from fieldwork
text collections, and elicited data. For illustrating grammatical phenomena, I
prefer to provide sentences from the collected texts over elicited sentences.
Syntactical and pragmatic phenomena can only seldom be demonstrated using
elicited sentences. As concerns these data, I assume a considerable Russian
influence (especially in the case of word order), which is a limitation of these
data. However, there are certain phenomena in the corpus data which proved

"1.2.1       Mental Transfer
Three verbs of speech are used most often: munuďa ‘say’, ďebtuďa ‘tell’ and
kumunsa ‘what say/tell’. The theme is always marked with the accusative. It
remains in the nominative, if the verb takes the imperative 2sg ending, as in
sentence (3b). Pronominal agent can be expressed lexically, if it is emphasized
as in (3c), but it is most often realized as null-subject (cf. (3a)). The following
sentences show the most typical construction with mental transfer verbs.

           ‘I will tell the children a small tale, not a tale, a simple story.’
                MACh_93_TwoTales_flkd.001The most usual order of the constituent in a construction with the verb ďeb-
tuďa ‘tell’ is (A) T AD V, as in sentence (3c), but if the theme is topicalized as in
sentence (3b), it takes the preverbal position and the addressee moves into the
postverbal position. Thus, if the agent is present, it always takes the preverbal
position and always precedes the addressee.
   The verb munuďa behaves differently. As example (3a) demonstrates, this
verb normally appears in the main clause, and the subordinate clause is its
theme argument, which is normally expressed as indirect speech in languages
that have it—Nganasan, does not (see Section 3 in Chapter 14). This verb can-
not be used with substantives like sʲitǝbɨ ‘tale’ and ďürɨmɨ ‘story’ as objects. As
mentioned in Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 10, the verb ‘what say’ does not have any
argument, the question word is incorporated into the verb. (For the structure
see example (49b) in Chapter 10.) So, there is a semantic difference between
the two verbs and their argument structures differ accordingly.
   Personal pronouns cannot take case markers and cannot be inflected in
the same manner as other nominal categories, thus if the recipient-like argu-
ment is pronominal, the speaker must use a different construction to code the
recipient. The oblique case forms of pronouns are replaced with postpositional
structures (see Section 4.1.1 in Chapter 3). In this case, the postposition ďa is
followed by the destinative suffix -Tə (-tə, -ðə), and by the oblique case form of
ditransitive constructions                                                     399possessive suffixes: ďatə-poss and ďaðə-poss. (For the paradigm, see Section
4.1.1 in Chapter 3). The pronominal addressee is mostly covert; it appears overtly
only to express emphasis. The personal pronoun can precede the postposition
(4b). If the special interrogative speech act verb kumunsa ‘what tell’ is used, the
theme argument cannot be expressed lexically (4a).(4) a.                          agent

            JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.0771.2.2      Physical Transfer
The recipient of a verb expressing physical transfer is expressed by a postposi-
tional construction with na ‘to, near’, if it is pronominal. It takes a possessive
suffix from the oblique series which denotes the person of the recipient. This
postposition is optionally accompanied by a personal pronoun. The recipient

ient, but it is possible to insert another phrase between them. So, in sentence
(6a) the agent, and in (6b), an anaphoric pronoun is inserted between the recip-
ient and the theme. The word order is Th R V.(6) a.              theme                          agent recipient

                TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.2781.3      Covert Recipient and Addressee
The recipient and adressee must not be overtly expressed in a Nganasan ditran-
sitive construction. If the recipient/addressee is a pronoun, it may also be omit-
ted. But if the recipient/addressee is pronominal, the theme argument must
take a destinative marker (cf. Section 5, Chapter 4) and have a possessive suffix
referring to the recipient/addressee (possessive strategy). Thus, in a ditransitive
construction neither the agent nor the recipient/addressee must be expressed
by a lexical element; a morphological marker can refer to them. The agent is
encoded through verbal morphology, with the verbal personal ending, while
the recipient/addressee is encoded through nominal morphology, with the pos-
sessive suffix showing the person and number of the recipient/addressee. This
construction is illustrated with the following examples:(7) a. theme {recipient}           {agent}
       {mənu}-güə-ðə-{mtə}         ńi-sɨðə-{m}  təðu-Ɂ.

        ‘They gave us money.’
              KES_031115_Paris_nar.320The same construction appears in passive sentences. In such cases, the agent is
never omitted, and the theme argument moves to the topic position. The recip-
ient is expressed with the possessive suffix on the theme. The verb is always in
the reflexive conjugation and, of course, it agrees with the grammatical subject
of the sentence, that is, with the theme. This construction may occur with the
verb ‘give’ (9), but it is most often used with speech act verbs (8). In sentences
wit speech act verbs, the agent cannot be overt.","[416, 417, 418, 419, 420]"
"6.3.1       Supine with -nA2Kə
The marker -nA2Kə (-nakə, -nagə, -ni͡akə, -ni͡agə) attaches to the S1 stem of the
verb, and the arising form appears in positive sentences. In negative sentences,
it attaches to the negative auxiliary, as the sentence (86b) below illustrates. The
agent is marked by an oblique form of the possessive suffix following the supine
marker: hoðətə-nagə-nuɁ ‘in order that we learn’, basu-nakə-nə ‘in order that I

not really clear. Gusev (2005: 23) claims that the two kinds of supine construc-
tions and the action noun with the suffix -bsa are interchangeable. However, it
must be noted, that there is not enough material to prove or disprove Gusev’s
statement.","[287, 288]"
"1.1       Standard Negation
The predicate in the narrow sense is negated through the inflected negative
auxiliary ńisɨ in the negative phrase (NegP), which is accompanied by the con-
negative form of the main verb. In a negative phrase, the auxiliary always takes
mood and tense markers and inflectional suffixes and it agrees with the subject
in person and number, and, if the object is lexically covert, with the object in
number. The negated verb takes the connegative marker -ʔ, which is homony-
mous with the 2sg imperative marker. The connegative form of the verb isʲa
‘be’ is suppletive: ŋuəɁ. From a typological point of view, the standard negation
is asymmetric (cf. Misetamo 2005). This means that negative sentences differ
from affirmative ones not only in that there is a negative element present, but
also through structural differences. The paradigm of the negative auxiliary is as
follows.© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_013

The negative auxiliary is imperfective; therefore, it takes the aorist marker that
attach to imperfective verbs (-NTU and -NTA1, cf. Section 2.2 in Chapter 5).
Note, however, that the aspect value of the construction depends on the value
of the main verb and not on the aspect value of the auxiliary. Thus, the con-
struction ńindɨm tuɁ does not mean ‘I am not coming’, but ‘I did not come’
408                                                                   chapter 12because the aspect value of the main verb tujsʲa ‘come’ is [+perfective]. Accord-
ing to Gusev (2015: 107), in the Taimyr subdialect, the negative auxiliary can take
a perfective aorist marker (-Ɂǝ). However, there are only very few examples of
the auxiliary with a perfective aorist marker, thus this form is very rare. Sen-
tences (1a–b) show a verb inflected in the common imperfective form, while
sentence (2) is an example of a verb form inflected in its perfective form.(1) a. tə, ńi-ntɨ-gǝj           kumuŋ-kǝlʲičǝ-Ɂ.

                KES_080726_Family_nar.031The negative auxiliary can take not only tense and mood markers, but deriva-
tional suffixes as well. The available data suggest that while aspectual and voice
makers tend to appear on the lexical verb, Aktionsart is marked on the nega-
tive auxiliary, as in sentences (5a–c) below. If a negative sentence is transposed
into passive voice, the main verb takes the passive suffix, as illustrated by sen-
tences (6a–b). The distribution of grammatical categories is summarized in
Table 12.2.
   The following sentences provide examples of the distribution. The most fre-
quent derivational suffix on the negative auxiliary is the iterative suffix (-Kə),
but there are examples with habituative (-mUNHA), attenuative (-btA), imper-
fective (-NTə), and the resultative (-Ɂkə) suffix as well.(5) a. mənə ďa-tə-nə             ńi-gə-tɨ-Ɂ

              TLN_061021_MyGrandmother_nar.003The negative auxiliary cannot be negated, but it can be used with other auxil-
iaries such as ǝku-/ǝkɨ- ‘maybe’ and ŋuəlɨ- ‘how can I not, of course’, as in (8–9).
(For auxiliaries, see Section 3.3, Chapter 3.) If the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ- is used,
the main verb (in this case, the negative auxiliary) always precedes this auxil-
iary and takes the connegative marker. On the other hand, the negated lexical
verb must also take the connegative marker. The negated main verb follows
the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ-. This means that in the sentence two verbs appear in the
connegative form: the negative auxiliary, and the negated lexical verb.(8) tə, əm-ɨ-čə              mintі͡agənɨ bəjna-ðu-r-sa

As mentioned in Table 12.2, the mood markers appear on the negative auxiliary.
Synchronically, there is no separate prohibitive verb. However, it is possible that
negation                                                                                    413historically the negative auxiliary (ńi-) and the prohibitive verb were different
(see Helimski 2004b). The prohibitive verb was documented by Castrén as hav-
ing the form ńe-,1 but in the present state of the language, there is no reason to
differentiate two separate morphemes for these functions which are formally
the same (see 12 below). The negative auxiliary can freely take mood markers,
except for the abessive marker. The following pairs of sentences show impera-
tive and prohibitive structures. The prohibitive forms have no special structure.(12) a. tu-Ɂ        → ńi-Ɂ           tu-Ɂ
        come-imp.2sg neg.aux-imp.2sg come-cng
        ‘Come!’       ‘Don’t come!’      b. mətu-ðə        → ńi-tə              mətu-Ɂ
         cut-imp.2sg.obc neg.aux-imp.2sg.obc cut-cng
         ‘Cut it!’        ‘Don’t cut it!’The sentence pair (12a–b) above shows verbs with subjective and objective con-
jugation suffixes. The prohibitive sentences show that the imperative 2sg and
the connegative suffix (cng) are formally the same (-Ɂ). Furthermore, it is also
demonstrated that there is no special prohibitive suffix or special prohibitive
negative element. The imperative suffix is attached to the negative auxiliary.
The difference in the form of the suffix in sentence (12b) is due to consonant
gradation (cf. Section 7.1 in Chapter 2) and is not connected to negation. The
lexical verb is in its connegative form and positioned after the negative aux-
iliary. The sentences above also illustrate that although the structure itself is
asymmetrical, the paradigm is symmetrical. Each imperative form has its cor-
responding prohibitive counterpart.
    The negative auxiliary can take other mood markers as well. The follow-
ing sentence pair illustrates this with forms bearing the irrealis marker. The
declarative-negative pair shows that the negative auxiliary takes the same
mood marker as the main verb in the positive sentence. The negative element
is the standard negative auxiliary.(13) a. mɨŋ tətu-baaðəə-muɁ muraŋga-j,        mɨŋ ńi-sɨə-mɨɁ

                ChND, 20081.3      Negation of Existential, Possessive and Locative Clauses
There are two negative existential elements used for negation in existential,
locative and possessive clauses. The verb ďaŋgujsʲa ‘not to exist’, which has
a full paradigm, and a negative particle ďaŋku ‘no’ used as a predicate in the
sentence. The other Northern Samoyedic languages do not have this particle-
like form, only the verb. The stem ďaŋku- has possible cognate verbs in Nenets
( jaŋko-), Enets (ďago-), Selkup (čaŋkɨ-) and a cognate word form in Kamas
(naga) as well as in Mator (ńäŋüh).2 For the negation of possessive sentences,
the negative auxiliary can also be used, if the possessive structure is expressed
by the have-verb honsɨ (see Section 1.3.2 below in this Chapter).","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433]"

1        Verbal PredicationThe most common distinction between verbal predicates is their simplicity.
The verbal predicate usually is simple. Complex predicates consist of an aux-
iliary and a lexical verb. There are only few auxiliary verbs, one of these aux-
iliaries is the negation auxiliary, which serves to form standard negation and
appears most often in complex verbal predicates. Other auxiliaries are seman-
tically not empty, but they have an additional, mostly modal meaning. In this
section, only examples for the usage of auxiliary konɨďi ‘go away’ are given. For
a detailed description of auxiliaries see Section 3.3 in Chapter 3, for negation
see Chapter 12.
    The auxiliary verb konɨďi ‘go away’ appears only in essive or resultative-
translative constructions. In these constructions an NP is followed by the infini-
tive form (converb1) of the BE-verb (isʲa) and the conjugated form of the aux-
iliary. Word order variations are not allowed. Contrary to Enets and Nenets,
the infinitive/converb construction wasn’t grammaticalized as the essive case.
This form has word stress of its own, and it never undergoes cliticization. The
following examples show this construction. Not only a noun (1a), but also an
adjective (or participle), a numeral (1c) can appear as the nominal element.
(For a detailed description on essive construction see Szeverényi & Wagner-
Nagy 2017a.)

               KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.0631.1         Predicate with Subjective Conjugation
Subjective conjugation applies to all verbs. Some intransitive verbs, as ńilɨďi
‘live’, isʲa ‘be’ can be encoded only with subjective conjugation (cf. Section 3.1
in Chapter 5). Transitive verbs take a subjective suffix only in cases where the
sentence has an overt object as in the following sentence.

          KNT_960825_Djingimjaku_nar.006If the object is an overt first or second person pronoun, the verb appears in a
subjective conjugated form. The pronoun functioning as the object needs not
occur immediately before or after the verb, but mostly they assume this posi-
tion. There are no examples for a pronominal object denoting a human entity
with non-subjective conjugation in the corpus. Sentences (3a–c) contain a sec-
ond person object, while sentences (4a–c), a first-person object.(3) a. ńemɨ-rə           tənə      ŋuča-ŋu    ńi-ŋɨ.

morphologically expressed on the verb (see Section 3.2). If the object is overt,
it can be expressed by a demonstrative referring to the person (5a) or by a
personal pronoun, and the verb remains in the subjective conjugation. Inter-
rogatives also co-occur with verbs that are inflected in subjective conjugation
(5b). (For pronominal object see also Section 1.2.2 in Chapter 10.)(5) a. təti-rə        tahari͡aa bii-Ɂi͡a-gəj,     təndɨ-či

conjugation type (6a–b), only in very few examples the objective conjugation is
found alongside an overt object (6c). Its use depends on the information struc-
ture of the text, as is shown in Chapter 14.(6) a. ou, loču        kur-ďəə-j           təmuŋka-ku-rə

              KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.047Thus, we can summarize that if any pronominal direct object appears in the
sentence it is governed by a verb conjugated in subjective conjugation. The
appearance of the nominal direct object does not trigger obligatory the use of
the objective conjugation. (See also Wratil 2013.)1.2        Predicate with Objective Conjugation
As mentioned above, the objective conjugation is only used with the 3rd per-
son object. Only transitive and transitive-reflexive verbs have objective forms,
intransitive verbs cannot take this ending. It is not compulsory to use the objec-
tive conjugation, if there is an object in the sentence. No connection has been
discovered between the definiteness or animacy of the object and the objective
conjugation. The objective conjugation can refer to both animate and inani-
mate entities (see sentences (8b) and (7) below). The use of conjugation types
is determined on the discourse level and not on the sentence level, and can
express i.e. the anaphoric reference to an object mentioned earlier (see below).
Here, some tendencies are described.
    It is compulsory to use the objective conjugation, if the object is ellipted
from the clause or the subordinate clause (cf. sentence (7) below). If the object
appears at the beginning of the sentence and it is not followed immediately
by the verb, the objective verb forms tend to be used. The suffix for objective
conjugation refers back to the object in the previous clause, thus it expresses
anaphoric reference. In sentence (7) the verb hotəguəmə ‘I’ll write it down’
refers to sʲitǝbɨ ‘tale’ in the preceding clause.

            KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.001In the following pair of sentences the first half of the first sentence (8a) intro-
duces the theme (a reindeer). In the second part of this sentence the theme is
referred to only by the verb ending. In the second sentence (8b) the speaker (old
man) uses the verb in the objective conjugation. The conjugation refers to the
object, which was referred to before the last sentence, thus the information sta-
tus of this referent is given, but actually not active. In the following clause, the
verb (mejŋɨmə) also is in the objective conjugation; this is because it refers to
the act of killing, that is, its reference is not the reindeer, but the action itself. In
the last clause, the objective conjugation of the verb again anaphorically points
to the reindeer.(8) a. sʲelujki͡a-ðɨ             küü-Ɂa,        koða-Ɂa-tu.

               MVL_080229_TwoEyes_flkd.062As mentioned above in Section 1.1, pronominal objects never appear with a verb
conjugated by the objective conjugation.
   There are some examples, in which the object is introduced inmediatelly
before the verb. This constituent is shifted in the left-peripheral, sentence ini-
tial position, thus in the topic position, and expresses an old information,
which is activated now. It means that it is not a part of the next clause. In this
case, the verb is always conjugated by the objective conjugation as in (9).

verb. In (12a) the verb is in the subjective conjugation. In the sentence, there
are both arguments: an agent and a patient and the object of the verbs pre-
cedes the verb immediately. On the other hand, in (12b), the ‘door’ is also a
patient of the action, though it is not the grammatical object of the sentence,
but the subject. The agent is not overt. In this case, the verb must be conjugated
reflexively.(12) a. tɨbijki͡aa ŋua      təlʲü-Ɂə.

              TNK, 2006Medial verbs, such as nǝnsuďi with the meaning ‘get up’ and ‘stop’, are inflected
in the reflexive-medial or in the subjective conjugation, depending on their
actual meaning; objective conjugation is not possible. If the verb nǝnsuďi
means ‘get up’, it must be inflected in the reflexive conjugation, if it means
‘stop’ it can be conjugated in the subjective or in the reflexive conjugation. If
the action is changed and the sentence is highlighted, the verb meanig ‘stop’
remains in the reflexive conjugation as in (13c).(13) a. əiɁ, tə tahari͡aa ŋanaɁsa-gümü nənsu-Ɂi-ðə.

position (such as ŋomtüďi ‘sit down’ etc.) or change of state are inflected in the
reflexive conjugation, if the sentence emphasizes the change of state. The fol-
lowing two examples show the usage of verbs denoting change of body position

              KNT_940903_KehyLuu.073However, it must be mentioned that not all verbs denoting movement can be
conjugated by the reflexive-medial conjugation. Only the following verbs are
able to take the reflexive endings: hojkuďa ‘run’; büüďa ‘go away’, čüüďa ‘arrive,
reach’, but they not necessary are conjugated reflexive (for motion verbs see
also Chapter 15, Section 3.2). The use of the conjugations is not evenly dis-
tributed. Table 9.1 illustrates the distribution of reflexive and non-reflexive form
of motion verbs in the corpus.
   The verb büüďa most often is conjugated reflexively, while other verbs take
subjective endings. The three following examples from three different speakers
provide examples of its two possible uses. In sentence (15a) the verb is in both
conjugations, in (15b) it is conjugated reflexively, and in (15c) it takes a subjec-
tive ending. Of course, the question arises, what determines the uses of one or
another conjugation.

               KBD_71_PolarFox_nar.008As we can see, when the verb is conjugated reflexively, there is never any indi-
cation of direction, while the verbs in the subjective conjugation are generally
accompanied by an indication of direction. However, it must be mentioned
that there are few exceptions as well.
   Sentences (16a–b) illustrate the use of the verb hojkuďa ‘run’. This verb is
much less frequently conjugated by the reflexive conjugation. If it is the case,
the verb means ‘run away, go away’, thus it denotes change, as sentence (16a)
depicts. If the verb denotes not only a change, but states the action, it is conju-

and the other, ŋɨaɁkisʲi, is always in the subjective. The following two examples

         chapter 4Nominal InflectionThis chapter discusses the characteristics of nominal categories and provides
an overview of the inflectional classes. The Northern Samoyedic languages
display highly flectional morphological characteristics concerning case and
numeral suffixes: these are always portmanteau morphemes.
   The following grammatical categories are present in the inflection of nouns:
number, case, and possessive personal suffixation. There is no grammatical
gender, and the animate/inanimate contrast also does not have grammatical
correlates. The linear order of inflectional morphemes is as follows:Singular: base+(derivational suffix)+(destinative suffix)+case/possessive
          marker
Dual:     base+(derivational suffix)+(destinative suffix)+dual marker+case/
          possessive marker
Plural:   base+(derivational suffix)+complex case, number and possessive
          marker
1        Stems and Their FormationThe present section discusses what kind of stems suffixes attach to. Morphemes
(both stems and suffixes) may have an extreme number of allomorphs, far
more than is usual in other Uralic languages. The stems are grouped according
to their morphophonological alternations. Stem morphemes appear in three
forms, called S1, S2, S3 stems.
   (a) The S1 stem is identical to the nominative singular form of the noun. This
stem type is not characterized by alternations.
   (b) The S2 stem is identical to the genitive/accusative singular form of the
word. It can be also derived from the plural nominative form by deleting the
glottal stop. If the base word ends in a consonant, the stem is augmented with
an epenthetic vowel -ə. The harmonic class of the stem (see Section 7.2 in
Chapter 2) is irrelevant for the formation of S2 stems. If the word contains a
consonant involved in gradation, it occurs in the weak grade in the S2 stem—
a fact that can be explained by the historic genitive marker -ŋ, which has been
lost, but retains its presence in the form of an empty slot word-finally. The last
syllable of the genitive form is thus, always closed, allowing gradation to hap-
pen. (For the rules of gradation, see Section 7.1 in Chapter 2.)© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_005

those cases in which a gradation consonant is present in the stem, which
appears in the syllabic weak grade in S2 stems.
   (c) The S3 stem is formed from the genitive plural form by removing the case
suffix -Ɂ from vowel-final stems. If the stem ends in a consonant, the S3 stem
gains a connecting vowel, following the suffix harmony rules (e.g. -U: -u/ -ɨ/
-ü/-i). The stem-final vowel in S3 stems is often different from the vowel of S1/S2
stems. Gradation affects gradation consonants in the same way as it does in S2
stem. In the sections below, the different stem types are described in detail. The
following listing gives only the typical stem types:(1) Typical nominal stems     S1       S2       S3        MeaningV# ńemɨ       ńemɨ-    ńemɨ-     ‘mother’

1.1        Vowel-Final Stems
Stems ending in a vowel exhibit two kinds of alternation: consonant gradation
and vowel alternation. In some cases, no change occurs in the stem, i.e. the
form of all three stems is the same, but the most frequent case is that S1 and
S2 are the same, and the stem-final vowel in the S3 stem changes. Usually no
vowel alternation appears in stems ending in -i, -ɨ or a diphthong -ɨ͡a, -i͡a, -u͡a, or
-ü ͡a. Words ending in u- usually alternate, but sometimes the alternation does
not happen. Words with [+backness] value ending in -a usually do not alter-
nate, while words with [-backness] value do. The list below includes words in
which the three stems are the same, meaning, neither vowel alternation nor
consonant gradation occurs in them.

papers which deal with this topic (cf. Várnai 2002, 2005; Várnai–Oszkó 2009).
Nganasan has a moderately complex syllable structure (cf. Maddieson 2013),
however the maximal syllable is CV͡VC. The most preferred syllables are CV and
CVC. The CCV type is not permitted. Table 2.9 below shows the possible syllable
types and their distribution in simple words. As can be seen, neither the onset,
nor the coda is obligatory. Furthermore, neither closed nor open syllables are
restricted to word-final position. Onsetless syllables can take all positions.

   Most words are bisyllabic or trisyllabic, starting with a consonant and end-
ing in a vowel. Derived words usually consist of three or four syllables—longer
derived words are rare, but possible; for example, bəńə-lə-btɨ-kuj- [break+
inch+caus+dur] ‘break into pieces’. Monosyllabic words are rare: there are
a total of only 19 monosyllabic words consisting of one vowel or diphthong
forming the nucleus, an obligatory onset and an optional coda of one conso-
nant. Most of the words have a CVC structure. Bound stems like əm- ‘this’ have
not been considered. In (5) examples of monosyllabic stems are provided.","[80, 81]"
"2.4      A Short Typological Overview
Like other Uralic languages, Nganasan is a typical agglutinative language. How-
ever, many morphemes consist of more than one morphological meaning.
Thus, the language displays a series of flectional features because several mor-
phemes are cumulative. (For nominal and verbal inflection see Chapters 4 and
5). Some morphemes (suffixes or clitic-like morphemes) are equivalent to lex-
ical items in European languages. (For this morphemes see Chapter 16). Pre-
fixation is absent. Nganasan grammar reflects many characteristics typical of
the Uralic languages, but also some unique features, cf. morphophonological
alternations (see in Chapter 3, Sections 7.1 and 7.3) etc.
   The open word classes are verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. These
classes can be distinguished by morphologic, syntactic and semantic criteria,
however adjectives are not clearly distinguished from nouns. There is a set of
relator nouns mostly with the locational semantics that take special (archaic)
markers of the Lative, Locative and Elative cases (See in Section 6 of Chapter 3).
   Nouns are inflected for number, case and possession. They can appear in
seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, lative-dative, locative-instru-
mental, ablative-elative and prolative) and three numbers (singular, dual and
plural). Possessive suffixes convey possessive meaning; indicating the person
and number of the possessor as well as the person and number of the possessed
introduction                                                                    19entity. Additionally, there is a category typical for the Northern Samoyedic lan-
guages, the (pre)destinative (see Section 5 in Chapter 4). Noun phrases display
the determiner and head constituent order. Possessive pronouns are missing.
   The verbs have three conjugation types (subjective, objective and reflexive).
They agree with the subject in person and number and can agree with the ob-
ject in number as well. Contrary to many other Uralic languages, there are three
morphologically expressed future tenses (general future, immediate future and
future-in-the-past). Additionally, Nganasan has two past tenses (past and plu-
perfect). Verbal stems are classified into two aspectual classes: they are either
imperfective or perfective. Depending on the aspect value, imperfective verbs
describe a present situation in the present tense (aorist), past situation in the
past tense, while perfective verbs denote the immediate past situation in the
present tense (aorist) and remote past situation in the past tense (cf. Section 4.2
in Chapter 5). Additionally to indicative, there are 11 morhologically expressed
verbal moods (imperative, admonitive, optative, interrogative, inferential, re-
portative, irrealis, necessitative, abessive, dubitative, speculative). Mood and
tense markers cannot be combined. Verb can be modified by a large number of
Aktiosart and modal suffixes as well (see Chapter 16).
   As in many other Uralic languages, standard negation is expressed by a nega-
tive auxiliary, which is followed by the so called connegative form of the lexical
verb. For negating of constituent a negative particle is used (cf. Chapter 12).
Predicate possession sentences belongs to the existential type, thus the pred-
icate verb is a special existential verb. However, opposed to the majority of
Uralic languages, possession can be expressed by a transitive verb as well. (For
possessive clauses see Section 4 in Chapter 9).
   Nganasan is a head-final language and has a non-rigid SOV word order. The
word order in a sentence is motivated by the information structure (cf. Chap-
ter 14). Determiners (inclusive possessors) are always left-branching. Accord-
ing to Holmberg’s classification, Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language
(Holmberg 2005, 2010), in which both, the pronominal subject and in cer-
tain circumstances the pronominal object can be omitted in a sentence. The
pronominal object of a sentence is only expressed overtly, if it receives extra
emphasis or if it is in a topic position (see Section 2.1 in Chapter 14). There is
no differential object marking, however the direct object of an imperative sen-
tences can appear in the nominative.
   Subordinate clauses are built with non-finite verb forms: participles or nom-
inalized forms, which preserve the argument structure of the base verb. The
use of conjunctions is not typical. Coordination is expressed by the simple
parataxis. Nganasan, like other Samoyedic languages, expresses definiteness
not through articles, but by other means, e.g. with possessive suffixes or word
20                                                                                      chapter 1order. (For more on the characteristics of the typology of Samoyedic languages,
see among others Bakró-Nagy 2012, 2006, Hajdú 1985 and Tauli 1963.)2.5       Orthography
2.5.1         Nganasan as a Written Language
The first official orthography was created by the Samoyedologist Natalya M. Te-
reshchenko in 1986, but the alphabet was inconsistent and the system has
never been widely used. In 1989, a committee (consisting of A.A. Barbolina,
A.A. Momdye, A.Ch. Momdye, E.A. Helimski) was set up in Dudinka to elim-
inate inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the Tereschenko system. The final
version of the orthography appeared in 1992. The alphabet employs all the
graphemes of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet and the following additional char-
acters: i, ÿ, ə, ң, Ɂ or ″, the last two symbols represent the glottal stop. The con-
sonant /ð/ is marked by the symbol ⟨δ⟩, but it is often replaced by the Cyrillic
⟨з⟩ or the symbol ⟨ʒ⟩ for typographical reasons.
   In sum, the alphabet consists of the following characters:     Ɂ (”), ə, a, б, г, д, δ (з, ʒ), е, ё (ѳ), и, i, й, к, л, м, н, ӈ, o, п, р, с, т, у, ÿ (Ү ), х, ч,
     ы, э, ю, яThe parenthesized letters can be used for technical reasons, to replace the
preceding character. Although this is the official alphabet, its use is not com-
pulsory. The usage of characters depends on the author and the editor of a
publication, mainly based on typographic considerations.
   Furthermore, loanwords may contain any of the following letters: в, ж, з, ф,
ц, ш, щ, ъ, ь
1. The writing principles—as well as the characters—are adopted from Rus-
      sian. This means that a palatalized or palatal consonant does not have a
      separate grapheme as in the phonological Latin script (e.g. ń [ɲ] versus
      n), but the palatality of the consonant is marked by the choice of the fol-
      lowing vowel character: an “iotated” vowel (и, ё, я, ю) instead of ы, о, а, у
      respectively, e. g. немы [ɲemɨ] ‘mother’, десы [ɉesɨ] ‘father’.
2. Long vowels are marked by doubling the vowel letter: маа [maː] ‘what’. If
      there is a palatal consonant preceding the long vowel, the long vowel is
      marked by a sequence of an iotated vowel and its non-iotated pair: няа
      [ɲaː] ‘Nganasan’. Vowel pairs are as follows: я—а, ю—ÿ, и—i, ё—о.
3. The letter ⟨i⟩ is only used after non-palatal consonants. The grapheme for
      a long i [iː] is ⟨iu⟩: miu [tiː] ‘the two of you’.
4. There is no separate symbol to denote the diphthongs [i͡a] and [u͡a] in the
      Cyrillic alphabet, these are marked by the letter sequences ⟨ua⟩ and ⟨ ya⟩,
introduction                                                                                              21     respectively. The diphthong [i͡a] is often marked by the Cyrillic letter ⟨я⟩,
     e. g. хяӈ [hi͡aŋ] ‘palm’.
5.   The rare vowel sequences /ia/, /üa/ are written as follows:
     Latin script Cyrillic script Examples     ia                  ea or иа                диа or rarely деа [ɉia] ‘brain’
     üa                  ёа, юа or ѳа            дюату, дёату or дѳату [ɉyatu] ‘s/he dis-
                                                 turbs’
6.   The assimilation of vowels is often marked in Cyrillic writing. For exam-
     ple, the traditional буəзу ‘word’ [buoðu] form is replaced by буозу.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"

In the Nganasan lexicon only few demonyms can be found. This is because of
the small number of peoples with whom Nganasan had close contact. Char-
acteristic, however, is the fact that a certain demonym does not specify one
group only, but can refer to different nations. In addition, a demonym is not
only assigned solely to the one group indicated by the name. For example, there
is not one demonym for the Enets in the Nganasan language but two, denoting
different groups of the Enets. The following demonyms can be found:(24) Folks taxonomie

In contrast to many other peoples, cooking is of no special significance to the
Nganasan. This is due to the harsh environmental conditions. Meals are pre-
pared in a relatively simple way, usually by cooking food in boiling water. Basic
ingredients are limited to game animals or plants. Herbs are generally non-
existent in Nganasan cuisine. In present-day speech some Russian loanwords
denoting food are also used. The list in (25) provides expressions for different
dishes and drinks.","[505, 506]"

Demonstratives are derived from three different stems: əm-, tə-, ta-. Semanti-
cally, these can be divided into two sets. One group of demonstratives expresses
direct pointing to something (proximal deixis), while the other group has dis-
tant deixis meaning.
   Based on examples in the corpus and interviews with consultants, it seems
that the choice of demonstratives is ‘speaker-oriented’, thus the deictic center is
based on the speaker. There are two kinds of deictic demonstratives, those indi-
cating ‘near the speaker, here’ (əm-) and those indicating ‘at a distance, there’
(tə- and ta-).
   The demonstrative adverbs are included as a subset of demonstratives. They
take the special spatial case marker, which occurs only with adverbs and post-
positions (see Sections 5 and 6 below)—and these also show the same distri-
bution as pronouns.
   The proximate locational demonstrative adverb, əmnɨ ‘here’, designates the
place near the speaker, while the distantial demonstrative adverb, tamnu
‘there’, refer to the places that are out of reach of the speaker. These adverbs
appear as the modifier of the verb as shown in (58a) and (58b).(58) a. ŋaďa-ðu,                   nɨ    ŋaďa-ðu,

of təti and əmtɨ are irregular: təndə and ǝmǝ. Both demonstratives are com-
plex forms and their reflex is a Proto-Samoyedic pronominal stem *ä- ‘this’
(der. *äm- Janhunen 1977: 19) and *tǝ ‘this, that’ (Janhunen 1977: 144). In the
present-day nominative form, the stems əmtɨ and təti have a 3sg possessive
suffix attached to the pronominal stem (əm-, tə-) and these forms have under-
gone lexicalization. The stem əmə is also a derivate with the adjectivizer suffix
-ə.
    The demonstratives are presented in the following table.

4.1.6). One stem can take more than one of these morphemes. The meaning
of these forms cannot be adequately translated into English. Some forms are

"6.3.2.4      Inchoative and Resultative Suffixes
Nganasan also has perfectivizing suffixes, which express a normally inchoative,
resultative or temporal meaning. One of the most frequently used derivational
suffixes is the inchoative suffix -LƏ (-lə, -lʲi) with the meaning ‘begin to S’, e.g.
hiďisʲi ‘laugh’ > hisʲi-lə-sʲi ‘begin to laugh’; ďaŋhɨďi ‘shine’ > ďaŋhɨ-lə-sɨ ‘begin
to shine’; ďorəďa ‘cry’ > ďorə-lə-sa ‘begin to cry’. This suffix can also express
semelfactivity, i.e. to indicate that the action happened only once. The stem of
such verbs is always a durative verb referring to a lengthy action, e.g. ďorəďa
‘cry’ > ďorə-lə-sa ‘cry out’; səŋü-r-sa ‘look’ cf. səŋü-lə-sa ‘catch sight of’; hiďisʲi
‘laugh’ > hisʲi-lə-sʲi ‘burst out laughing’. In contrast to Nenets (cf. Nikolaeva 2014:
46), the derivative in Nganasan does not belong to the reflexive inflectional
class, the verb can be conjugated by subjective or objective conjugation as well.
   The inchoative-resultative suffix-Ɂkə is a very frequent and productive deri-
vational suffix. It appears on the S1 stem of the verb. The derivative is always a
perfective verb (S1: V+-Ɂkə → VPerf). The meaning of the derived word is ‘begin
to do something and probably finish doing it as well’; ďarəðɨ-sɨ ‘be ill’: ďarəðɨ-

               KES-ChND_080725_Childhood_conv.046There is a temporal suffix -Kəl (-kəl, -gəl) with the meaning ‘at the moment’.
This rare suffix describes actions that are limited in time. The meaning of the
derivatives is similar to the meaning of words with an inchoative suffix, e.g.
barə-ďa ‘wait’ > barə-gəl-sa ‘wait a little’; bi͡arə-ďi ‘open’ > bi͡arə-gəl-sɨ ‘open a
little’; ďeru-sa ‘not to know’ > ďeru-gəl-sa ‘not to know a little’.
    The intentional suffix -ɁhA2n (-Ɂhu͡an, -Ɂhi͡an) attaches to the S1 or S3 stem
of an imperfective or perfective verb. The emerging verb is always perfective
(S1/S3: Vperf/imperf + -ɁHA2n → Vperf). The derivates typically occur next to
motion verbs as a purposive adjunct, but motion verbs themselves can also take
this suffix, e.g. čiiɁni͡ar-hi͡an-sɨ ‘intend to enter’, tujsʲa ‘come’ > tuuɁnar-hu͡an-sa
‘intend to come’.(43) a. hii-m-a-tu               ďa čiə-ďiəďəi-nə

The frequentative suffix -r is primarily used as an aspect marker: it forms imper-
fective verbs, but it also carries its original, frequentative meaning, e.g. ŋəmsa
‘eat (up)’ > ŋəmursa ‘eat’; mənəgəisʲa ‘fall down’ > mənəgəirsʲa ‘fall down usu-
ally’; laŋəɁkəsa ‘shout’ cf. laŋürsʲa ‘shout occasionally’; tolɨďi ‘steal something’
> tolarsa ‘steal occasionally’
    Words with the suffix -ɁnA2r (-(Ɂ)nar, -(Ɂ)ni͡ar) describe events that are
repeated within irregular intervals in a certain period of time. The derivational
suffix is morphologically complex. It is made up of two suffixes with a fre-
quentative meaning, although the -na morpheme is not used as a separate
derivational suffix in present day Nganasan. The meaning of words with the
-r frequentative suffix (see above) describe events repeated more regularly, as
the sentences in the corpus show. Examples: büü-ďa ‘go away’ > büü-Ɂnar-sa ‘go
away more than once’; kou-ďa ‘drop behind’ > kou-Ɂnar-sa ‘drop behind more

perfective verbs. It deletes the final vowel of the stem.(48) a. bɨðɨbt-i͡alɨ-rɨ-ndi-ti

modal meaning ‘want to S’. The suffix turns imperfective or perfective verbs
into imperfective verbs, e.g. hoðətəsa ‘write’ > hoðətə-nantu-sa ‘want to write’;

              TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.116In Nganasan expressing the concept ‘wanting’ is also possible using verbal con-
cept. There are two verbs with the meaning ‘want’: kərbuďa and hujsʲi. If no
other verbal element occurs in the sentences, instead of the volitive suffix, one
of these verbs must be used. The verb hujsʲi can have an argument as direct
object, which also stays in accusative (50b). The verb kərbuďa cannot have an
direct object as argument. (More on the distribution of the verbs see Jark 2018.)(50) a. ďaŋku,       ńi-ndɨ-m           kərbu-Ɂ, maa-gəlʲičə nɨ

The suffix -TU (-ðɨ, -ðu, -tu, -tɨ) attaches to postpositions or adverbs. The result-
ing verb refers to the state arising as the result of motion. The derivative is
always imperfective, e.g. ŋilʲə ‘downwards’ > ŋilʲəðusa ‘be down’; huə ‘backwards’
> huəðusa ‘be in the back’; ńerə ‘the front’ > ńerəðɨsɨ ‘be in the front’.(51) tu-lʲə         ləŋ-sʲiti-ðə             təə čüü-Ɂə-Ɂ         ma-mənu

            KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.0766.4       Adverbial Derivation
Adverbs can be formed from adjectives or nouns with several derivational suf-
fixes or certain case suffixes, for example with the genitive plural suffixes -Ɂ
(ńaagəǝ: ńaagəiɁ ‘good’ [adv]) and with the prolative suffixes -mənu (ərəkərə:
ərəkərə-mənu ‘beautifully’). Both suffixes form adverbs of manner. (For the case
suffixes, see Section 3, Chapter 4).
   The caritive suffix -KA2lʲi creates adverbs of manner or circumstance from
nouns, e.g. ŋənduj ‘boat’: ŋəndujkalʲi ‘without a boat’; tuj ‘fire’: tuj-kalʲi ‘without
fire’; tala ‘happiness’: tala-kaľi ‘unhappily’. Another privative denominal suf-
fix is the suffix -KA2j. Adverbs ending in this suffix are generally used together
with the word ičuə, which is the present participle form of the copula (isʲa), e.g.
sʲejmɨ ‘eye’: sʲejmɨgaj ičuə ‘blind’ [‘being without eyes’]; čiirü ‘cloud’: čiirügi͡aj
ičuə ‘clear’ [‘being without clouds’]; nɨ ‘woman’: nɨgi͡aj ičuə ‘single’ [‘being with-
out a wife’]; ńuə ‘child’: ńuəgaj ičuə ‘childless’ [‘being without a child’]. The
usage of these two suffixes is illustrated with the following sentence pair.(52) a. Seu Melʲaŋgana-tǝ sɨlɨ, kǝči sɨlɨ-gəlʲičǝ sejmɨ-gaj i-čuǝ

              KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.066The suffix -səbtə has a sociative meaning (‘together with S forming a single
entity’) and forms adverbs from nouns: ŋuhu ‘sleeve’ > ŋubusəbtə ‘together with
a sleeve’; taa ‘reindeer’ > taasəbtə ‘together with a reindeer’; kahi͡a ‘clothes of a
shaman’ > kabi͡asəbtə ‘together with the clothes of a shaman’. For more exam-

           ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.0307       Clitic-like MorphemesThere are some morphemes in Nganasan whose morphological status is not
determined with certainty. Based on the way they are used, they form an inter-
mediate category between derivational suffixes and clitics. They are character-
ized by not behaving consistently: their position can depend on the speaker or
the part of speech of the word as well. Practically all of them can co-occur with
verbal and nominal stems, but not with the same frequency: some morphemes
occur more frequently with nominal stems. But their position in relation to
each other is set, although they do not occur together very often. The following
morphemes belong to this group: -Küə, -KüCmü, -ŋUTU, -ŋA2lə, -Kəlʲičə, -btA2,
-Cčǝ and -uɁ. In the discussion below, I will refer to these morphemes as “clitic-
like morphemes”.

verbal and nominal suffixes. These morphemes can occur in three positions.
The morphemes that still preserve their clitic-like characteristics always occur
word-finally, whereas those that are relatively lexicalized precede even tense/
mood suffixes.","[551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558]"

   to the peripheral possessor, the third position is the position of the regular pos-
   sessor. Both positions can be filled. In the second position the modifier of the
   regular possessor stays. The quantifiers of the head noun very seldom appear
   with other modifiers; if this happens, they always precede the attributive part,
   but never occur before a numeral, a determiner, or a possessor. At the same
   time, there are no such clauses where all positions are filled. Sentences in which
   more than one type of pre-modifier precedes the head noun are quite rare.
   Their order is as follows in Table 8.1.
      As the following sentences show, the possessor can occur with a determiner.
   The position of the possessor depends on whether the determiner is a part of
   a possessive construction. If it is a part of the possessive construction, it takes
   the internal position, thus it appears after the possessor expressed by an NP
   or pronoun as in sentence (35). However, if the determiner refers to the whole
   possessive construction, it takes the position before the possessor, as in sen-
   tences (36a–b). The possessive constructions are discussed in detail in Section
   4.2 above.

be filled by any vowel. Nuclei with diphthongs are complex, while vowel se-
quences do not occur in a nucleus, since from the point of view of phonology;
they are syllabified into two syllables (cf. Section 5 below). If the onset is empty,
only five vowels are possible as a nucleus (ə, a, i, ü and u), and any vowel can
occur in non-word-initial syllables, however, the non-central mid vowels (e and
o) occur only as variants of /ə/ in the speech of some speakers. In general, there
is no restriction on nuclei: any vowel can occur in a closed or an open syllable:(11) NucleiVowels In open syllable                  In closed syllablei         i.ri ‘grandfather’             bin.dar ‘line’

4.3      Coda
The coda is either empty (unfilled) or simple, there are no complex codas
attested, thus consonant clusters in codas are not permitted. There are two
types of empty codas. Some empty codas are truly unfilled, while other codas
are empty because they have an empty slot (where an empty slot does not equal
an empty coda, for empty slot see Section 4.4 below).
   Consonant clusters appear intervocalically, these are coda–onset sequences,
as in ďeb.tu ‘goose’. Both empty and simple codas can be found word-internally
and word-finally. However, in a word-final simple coda only /j/, /m/, /ŋ/, /r/
and /Ɂ/ are present. (For more details, see in Table 2.4 in Section 1.2 above.) In
word-internal codas except for the glottal stop /Ɂ/ and /b/, all obstruents are
prohibited.

4.4       Empty Slot
The empty slot is empty because the consonant in the coda position is deleted
as the results of a synchronic phonological process such as gradation or conso-
nant deletion (for example, degemination), or the consonant in the coda has
developed through historical change. But a trace of these consonants remains,
in the form of an empty slot. A syllable ending in an empty slot behaves like
a syllable with a coda. However, an empty slot can never be filled, so a coda
ending in an empty slot cannot be called an empty coda. An empty slot char-
acteristically behaves as if the coda were filled with a consonant (n, k, t, or s),
thus, it plays a role in blocking some phonological processes, such as consonant
gradation, or in triggering others, such as consonant deletion (see Sections 7.1
and 7.6 below).
   Former descriptions of Nganasan phonology (Helimski 1994a and 1998, Vár-
nai 2002 and 2010, Wagner-Nagy 2009) do not refer to empty slots, but they
postulate a zero- or quasi-consonant, written as /C/. The differences between
the two models is that the former descriptions postulate a null or empty con-
sonant that will either be realized or not. The model presented in this work
is based on the syllable structure and not on the phoneme. The empty slot
(marked with C) is present in all positions, as the examples in (13) show.","[84, 85, 86]"
"7.6.1       Deletion of the Stem-Final Consonant
As mentioned in Section 1.2, the distribution of consonants at the end of words
is restricted; only /Ɂ/, /m/, /ŋ/, /r/ and /j/ occur in this position. As described
in Section 1, there are no long consonants in Nganasan. If a sequence of two
identical consonants is created during suffixation, they are always degeminated
or otherwise eliminated. However, the consonant deleted during degemina-
tion keeps its position in the syllable as an empty slot (see Section 4.4 above).
Evidence for this is reflected by the fact that consonants affected by Syllabic
Gradation continue to be in the weak grade even though its surface form is
86                                                                      chapter 2contains an open syllable and consequently would normally be strong grade,
cf. (43). If the stem is not in CVC[GRAD]VC form, the presence of the empty seg-
ment cannot be verified, although degemination does happen.(43) bi͡aðim ‘shin bone’ + mə [1sgposs]: bi͡aðiCmə ‘my shin bone’ and not
                                         *bi͡atimə
     kam ‘blood’         + mə [1sgposs]: kaCmə ‘my blood’
     ńim ‘name’          + mə [1sgposs]: ńiCmə ‘my name’Since the number of consonants that can occur in an absolute word-final posi-
tion is limited (Ɂ, m, ŋ, r, j), the number of combinations is limited as well.
Suffixes beginning with a glottal stop always connect to the stem with a linking
vowel. When connecting to stems with consonants, suffixes beginning with -r
alternate with -l. The stem-final -r is always preserved as in malʲir+Rə → malʲirlə
‘your nomad camp’. This process is described in Section 7.7 below.
   Suffixes that begin with a nasal, stop or liquid delete the stem-final /Ɂ/. The
stem-final /ŋ/ disappears before suffixes that begin with a liquid or nasal, while
before suffixes beginning with a stop it alternates with /n/ (for more on nasal
assimilation, see Section 7.3.2). The stem final -j and -r do not take part in
this process, as the examples in (44) below demonstrate they are always pre-
served. It ought to be noted that the deleted consonants (-Ɂ, -ŋ and -m) become
empty segments. As the examples show, the suffix-initial trill turns into a liquid
after an empty slot. (For more on the r~l consonant alternation, see Section 7.7
below.)(44) Deletion before bilabial nasal, stop and liquid-initial suffixes-C# Example                  -mə [1sgposs] -Rə [2sgposs] -TU [3sgposs]-Ɂ kuɁ ‘cough’         kucmə                   kuclə             kuctu

phonetics and phonology                                                          87   Deleted segments block or even trigger gradation. This occurs, for example,
in the word tugɨCmǝ ‘my cloth’. The consonant /g/ in all forms is in syllabic
weak grade, because the empty segment /C/ closes the syllable. Furthermore,
the suffix-initial -t in 3sgposs is in strong grade, although it is in the onset of
an odd numbered syllable and, as such, should be of rhythmic weak grade, if
the ⟨C⟩ did not block this process. (For more on gradation, see Section 7.1; on
empty slot, see Section 4.4.)
   Note that the stem final -j palatalizes the first consonant of the suffixes and
often coalesces with it. This latter process is not obligatory, but is speaker spe-
cific. Thus a /jt/ sequence appears as ⟨jč⟩ or even as ⟨č⟩ (cf. Section 7.4.1).
   In the case of several verbal stems, in some forms the stem ends in a conso-
nant (e.g. aor.3sg) and in others it ends in a vowel (e.g. inf). This phenomenon
can be explained, if we hypothesize an empty slot at the end of the stem. The
corresponding strong grade consonants are /t/, /s/ and rarely /k/, which are
however deleted before the infinitive ending. These stems behave as if the stem
ended in a consonant: the stem-internal consonants are in weak grade due to
SG in closed syllable, as in noguC.sa ‘to approach’. Furthermore, the suffix-initial
consonant is in its strong grade, because the empty segment blocks RG, as in
bəu-sa ‘cross’ (instead of *bəu-ďa). If there were not an empty segment, rhyth-
mic weak grade would surface at the beginning of an odd numbered syllable
or after a VV sequence. In the aorist forms, the stem-final consonants stay in a
closed syllable, for this reason the Syllabic Gradation operates on them. Exam-
ples are given in (45).","[104, 105, 106]"

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.0422.3     Biaspectual Verbs
Biaspectual verbs are underived verb stems that can be followed by either of
the two aorist suffixes. One of these suffixes implies that the verb in the aorist
tense has present meaning, while in the other case, the meaning is past, as in
hu͡aŋku-ďa ‘be drunk’: hu͡aŋka-Ɂa-m ‘I have got drunk.’ or hu͡aŋku-tu-m ‘I am
drunk.’
3       Conjugations TypesSimilar to other Northern Samoyedic languages (Nenets and Enets), there are
three conjugation types: subjective, objective and reflexive-medial. Every con-
jugation type has its own set of inflectional endings. Personal suffixes express
the number of the object and so, there are three paradigms in the objective
conjugation, referring to 1) one object 2) two objects 3) more than two objects.
Verbal personal suffixes attach to a verbal stem followed by a tense or mood
marker. The S1 form of this relative stem (absolute stem + tense/mood marker)
is followed by the personal suffix.

relation to the object and on the type of conjugation applicable: intransitive,
intransitive-reflexive, transitive and transitive-reflexive.
   Some intransitive verbs, e.g. nəmtəďa ‘feel, discover’, nəńďisʲi ‘stand’, ďoðürsa
‘walk’, basuďa ‘hunt’, isʲa ‘be’, ńilɨďi ‘be’, can be conjugated only in the subjec-
tive conjugation—objective and reflexive-medial forms are missing from their
paradigm.(13) a. mɨŋ tɨmini͡a koruð-ə-tənu-nuɁ               koru-laa

up, stop’, bənuďa ‘get tired’, bəlu͡ačusa ‘get angry’ have both subjective and
reflexive forms. Most of these verbs denote volatile movements of the actor’s
own body: change of place or body position. Additionally, verbs denoting men-
tal actions also belong to the set of medial verbs. These cognitive verbs are gen-
erally non-derived and the reflexive forms are used most often. The following
examples demonstrate that both conjugation types can be used. In sentences
(14a) and (15a) the verbs appear in the reflexive conjugation, while sentences
(14b) and (15b), exhibit the subjective conjugated forms.(14) a. urubaakə-mə           ńakələ-ni͡agə-nə, bəbə-nə          ńi
