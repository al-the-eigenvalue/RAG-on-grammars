                     1.    Basic constituent order is VSO (order of direct object and
                           oblique may vary).
                     2.    Fronting of NP's (or other elements) to the left of the verb
                           is a possibility under pragmatically marked conditions.
                     3.    There is a tendency to move given information to end of the
                           clause (relative to the order of direct object and oblique).
                     4.    The language is agglutinative and polysynthetic.
                     5.    There is essentially no nominal case marking for subject and
                           object (but Set II clitics have case/pronominal features).
                     6.    Relative clauses are post-head.
                     7.    Descriptive modifiers are post-head.
                     8.    Relativization may be by deletion                     or by retention         of a
                           Set I or Set II clitic in the position relativized.
                     9.    Manner adverbs generally follow the verb.
                     10.   Auxiliaries precede the verb.
                     11.   The dominant       negative      particle néé precedes               the verb.
                     12.   (Some) modal formatives are affixal to the verb.
                     13.   Embedded verbs generally follow the embedding verb.
                     14.   Clausal objects follow the main verb.
                     15.   There is no overt copula.
                     16.   Placement of the yes/no question particle is specified with  _
                           reference to the beginning of clause (second position within C).
                     17.   In information questions, the questioned NP is fronted
                            ('movement' of questioned NPs from embedded clauses is also
                           a possibility at least for subjects).
                     18.   Some adverbial and complement clause types follow their main
                           clause (though conditionals and other -tiy clauses precede
                           their main clause).
                     19.   Complementizers precede their clause.","[406, 407]"

                     exceptionless, we cannot guarantee that a given iJanguage did not                                  pass

She        says:                              This may have a functional motivation: if       the   verb    comes

                              grammatical    relations      (which are marked on the nouns) are
                              established    at    the    outset.     Establishing   grammatical
                              relations   at    the   beginning   is commmicati vely efficacious

"                             8 Chafe    (1976)   doesn't     actually        use        the     term   ‘single      focus
                     contrast',        but others    have applied         this     term to situations         where      the
                     three     conditions   he   outlines    hold    true        (e.g   Dooley    1982).                           9 the term 'double focus contrast'    is   sometimes     used    in   the
                     literature.     Asserting a correct  match-up   betwen  two   paris  of   items
                     is clearly far more common, though    Chafe    suggests    that    situations
                    with triple contrast might be possible.

                     which an affirmative is expressed by the negative of the contrary.",[391]
