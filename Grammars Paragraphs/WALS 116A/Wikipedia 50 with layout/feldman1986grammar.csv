Yes-no questions also have the same focusing strategies avai lable to them a s do
declarative sentences as described in section 9 . 4 .
I n answering an affirmative quest ion , owo means yes  it acknowledges the
                                                                          -
accuracy o f the proposition presupposed by the que stion .
In answering affirmative yes-no questions , awtuw no denies the accuracy of the
proposition pre supposed by the que stion . Awt uw also functions as a predicate
meaning lack� be absent.

                  no� they haven 't arrived ye t
Awt uw and owo in answers to negative que stions are completely ambiguous and
must be accompanied by a claus e , usually consi sting of a s ingle verb without
arguments expressing the real-world situation .

9 . 1 . 2 Alternative questions are formed by concatenating yok r i with the
alternative s , y ok r l fol lowing each alternative . Any constituent may enter into
such constructions , including a verb phrase . The al ternatives need not be
adjacent , as shown in example ( 8b ) .

The answer to an al ternative question wi l l ordinarily consist of an echo of the
correct alternative preceded by the focus particle po . Thus the answers to the
que stions in examples ( 1 0 ) and ( 1 2 ) might be :

9 . 1 . 3 WH- questions are formed using the set of interrogative adverbs and
pronouns described in 3 . 6 . 4 and tabulated here for convenience .","[148, 149, 150]"
"The adverb y i pe where ? occurs only as the predicate in a verbless question and
as such is constrained to occur clause finally ( see 8 . 2 ) .
                                                                                     145

               ( b ) :"" y i p e I)amey
Othe rwise , constituents in a WH -que stion have the same freedom of order as they
do in other types of c lauses . In particular, there is no requirement , though
there may be a slight tendency , for the interrogative to occur clause initially .

               (c)     w-iIly - r e r e yen ye kak ?
The interrogative pronouns take nominal case marking and may replace a nominal
constituent in any role .

               who ( F ) has Nay tow gone to the bush with ?
I nterrogatives may replace more than one constituent in such a que stion .
      ( 2 0)   ye r a n yekak y a k umoYiIln rokw- r e ?
               who ? when ? what?            do- FU
               when wi l l who do what?
The answer to a WH-question will ordinarily consist of the word that wi l l most
suitably replace the interrogative in the question . When the interrogative
bears case marking , the answer too wi l l usually have it , even if the answer
consists of only a single word . It is common , though not quite as common as
in answers to alternative questions , for the particle po to focus the answer .

9.2   Nega t i o n
Awtuw has two basic negation strategie s . The negative prefix ka - / kiIl- may f i l l
the f i r s t s lot in the verb complex t o negate any verbal predicate . And the
negative particle y e n e may negate any constituent , inc luding a predicate
nominal or adj ective , a verb , or even a negative verb , that it precede s .
146
There are also two special portmanteau morpheme s that code the negatives of the
second and third person debitive modal ities , the Prohibitive pre f ix (PR) a p ­
and the Negative Debitive ( NDB ) prefix n i l - , respective ly . The se are discussed
in 4 . 2 .","[150, 151, 152]"
"
8 . 7 . 1 Two of the four predicates may be regarded as participating in more or
less straightforward Ascriptive predications that happen to take complements
( see 10 . 2 . 5 ) .

8. 7 . 2 We saw in the discussion of Idiomatic composite predicate s ( 5 . 9 ) that
nenffin thought occupies the same position in the nenffin l§� construction as do
nouns in other predicates of the same type . Its abi l ity to take - neney he re
provides further evidence for be l ieving ne nffin to be a noun . The adj ective­
deriving suffix on neknek in example ( 2 2 ) suggests that i t may be a noun
denoting ' knowledge ' . But as the next example i l lustrates , neknek can occur
                                                                               141
as the predicate without derivation or any verb with which t o partic ipate in a
composite construction , making the gloss ' knowledge ' appear most improbable and
casting doubt upon its part -o f - speech a f f i l iation .

8 . 7 . 3 Finally , there is a predicate that I am inclined to regard as a
defective verb . A rene takes none of the verb morphology de scribed in Section
4 , but neither does it accept any other affixation except the optional plural
marker - m . It cannot even take - neney , as neknek and ne n�n can , nor can it
modify a noun attributively . I will not speculate further upon its part -of­
speech membership , but simply exempli fy its use .

Awtuw ha s three basic strategies for forming que stion s . Yes -no que stions are
di stingui shed from declarative clau ses by a change in intonation contour .
Alternative questions are formed by postposing the particle yok r i perhaps to
each alternative . wH-questions are formed by substituting one of the set o f
interrogative s , which begin with I y l in Awtuw , for a constitue nt .","[146, 147, 148]"
"
9 . 1 . 1 While each word stress in a declarative sentence is uttered at approxi­
mately the same pitch , in a yes-no que stion , the last word stre ss in the clause
is appreciably higher in pitch than the others and the pitch of any syllable s
fol lowing that stressed syllable falls markedly as a result . Constituents in a
yes-no que stion have the same freedom of order as in a declarative sentence .

Yes -no questions frequently include the particle yok r i perhaps. This par tic le
may not occur clause initially and most commonly occurs clause finally . When
it occurs clause medially , yok r i has the e f fect of focusing the constitue nt it
follows .",[148]

Note that one of the ' lexical ' adverbs , i m night , may be quantified by a
numeral or other quantifier to indicate a length of time . But since it has
none of the diagnostic properties of nouns , I c lassify it as an adverb .

Particles fall into four semantic subclasses . The a lternative particle , yok r i

The Negative particle yene i s d i scussed i n section 9 . 2 on Negation strategies
and the Focus particle po i s discussed i n section 9 . 4 . 1 on focus ing strategie s .
Two of the remaining Particles , t a and t a ke , mean here . The rest a l l mean
roughly straightaway . The particles t uwp and ap tend to gravitate to c lause­
initial pos ition and yeka and awan a tend to gravitate to second posi tion .
We can display the distinctions on a feature matrix and i l lustrate the
structure of the classification as a tree .","[42, 43]"

To begin with the pronouns , we notice immediately that there are two
demonstrative roots , ( t ) a de and ( t ) opo , each of which codes a category of
proximity , within reach and out of reach respectively . The se are then marked

from non-female referents . The optional t- in the pronouns and the manner
adverb does not appear to correlate with any grammatical category and forms
with and without the t- are in free variation . The eight manner adverb forms
also seem to be in free variation .
We may conveniently compress the demonstrative adverb forms into the fol lowing
constructs .

7 . 3 . 3 Quantifiers are more constrained than Pronouns in the range of Nomina ls
they may determine . A Quantifier may not determine any Nominal that is other­
wise quanti fied in any way , either by a Quanti fier in the Quanti fier constituent
or by number marking on the Noun . Furthermore , a Quantifier may not determine
any Proper Noun or S . Quantifiers may only determine otherwise unquanti fied
Common nouns .

                   *both/al l/three chi ldrenThere is one Quantifier nevertheless worthy of special di scussion . Like the
other Quantifiers , dren i may occur in either the Determiner or the Quanti fier
component .
When dren i determines an NP , it means one, another, the other.
      (24)     (a)   dam i   r ame monokene
                     another man bad
                     another bad man
               (b)   dam i   yam
                     another child
                     another child
When it appears in the Quanti f ier constituent of an otherwise determined NP , it
retains this meaning.
      (25)     opo- m rew r e dren i
               that-PL house other
               those other houses
But i f it occurs as the Quanti fier of an undetermined Nominal , then it marks
the NP as inde finite .
      ( 26 )   (a)   ta l e owyren dren i
                     woman old     a
                     an old woman
               (b)   worn    rey l e dren i
                     coconut dry a
                     a dry coconut
I t is conceivable that the basic meaning of an NP with dren i in any position is
that the referent of that NP is not the most sa lient instance of the type that
the NP denotes (Avery Andrews , pc ) .
                                                                                   125
What i s odd is that when dffin i seems t o b e most determiner-like semantically,
when it signals indefiniteness , it must occur in the Quantifier s lot , where we
would expect it to be less determiner - like . And when i t occurs as a Determine r ,
it has the less determiner- like meaning . I t may be possible t o explain this in
terms of dffin i ' s prede liction to mean precisely one , in thi s pos ition . Dffin i
substitutes for the numeral n a ydowo one in many contex t s . I ndeed , naydowdowo
only one, alone appears to occur much more frequently than the bare nume ral ,
probably because dffin i is the unmarked form for one .
Once we have established that dffin i as a Quantifier is very much l ike the
numeral one , it requires no great leap to see how it has come to mean a , as
the numeral one has in many other language s .
For example , i n Tongan , despite a three-way di stinction o f re ferentiality - the
artic le ha ' non - referential ' contrasting with the article e/he ' referentia l '
which in turn contrasts with the article e/he with an accompanying shift in
stress to the last vowe l in the NP ' definite ' - the commonest way o f marking an
NP as non-referential is to use a construction with the numeral .
     (27)     ma i    fo ' i  s u l uka e      t a ha
              give-me NOUN CL cigarette NUM CL one
              give me a cigarette
Awtuw has a construction precisely parallel to the Tongan .

Three type s of lexemes may take Possessive marking . Any noun with the plural
suffix -m may take Possess ive marking . Forms with the dua l , plural , and generic
suffixe s also accept the Possessive su ffix . And all Personal Pronouns are
eligible to take - ke .
Nouns unmarked for number , including Proper and Place names , demons trative s and
interrogatives are followed by the possess ive form of a third person personal
pronoun . The pronoun carrying possessive marking agrees in number and gender
with the referent of the NP in accordance with the principles discussed above .

Note that one of the Intensifiers , y a n keyke a litt le, s lightly is also a
DIMENSION Ad j ective meaning sma l l , and a Quantifier meaning a little (quantity ) ,
and may occur i n either the Adjective o r the I ntensifier slot .

Yankeyke may double as an Intens ifier in tongue- in-cheek contexts if the
Adj ective is not yan keyke .

7.5   Word o r d e r p e rmuta t i o n s
When a Common noun is high in empathy , Ad j ective s often , and more complex
Adjective phrases sometimes , precede i t . Examples like ( 38 ) and ( 3 9 ) motivate
the abbreviated Empathy hierarchy in ( 4 0 ) .
      (38)     (a)    wa ruke t a l e
                      big     woman

                      long dog
      (40)    Abbreviated Empathy Hierarchy
              [ +HUMAN ] > [ +ANIMATE ] > [ -ANIMATE ]
In fact , certain c lasses of adjectives have a strong tendency to precede high
empathy nouns . VALUE adj ectives , e . g . rnonokene bad, AGE adj ectives , e . g . owyren
old, and HUMAN PROPENSI TY adjectives , e . g . y i tarn generous are most l ikely to
precede the nouns they modi fy , other clas ses of adjectives , as in ( 4 1d ) and
( 4 1 e ) , do so too .
      (41)     (a)    yi tam   rarne
                      generous man
                      generous man
               (b)    rnede r arne
                      good man
                      good man
               (c)    owt i ykayren ta 1 e
                      old           woman

               (d)    yan keyke t a l e
                      sma l l    woman
                      sma l l woman
               (e)   k u p kwap t a l e
                     fast       woman
                     fast woman
Most PHYS ICAL PROPERTY adjectives e ither may not co-occur with human nouns , as
in ( 41 f ) , or become HUMAN PROPENSITY adj ectives in such constructions , as in
( 4 1h ) . When a PHYSICAL PROPERTY adj ective , as such , modifie s a human noun , it
tends to depersonify that noun , reducing it in empathy . So these are more
l ikely to follow the noun , as in ( 4 1 j )
               ( f ) ""' t a l e warn
                       woman b lunt

                        woman light
                        light woman
Occasionally, a full Adj ective phrase will precede the noun , as in ( 42 a ) .   But
it is more common for the I ntensi fier to follow the Noun , as in ( 42b) .
       (42)      (a)    ya nya n keyke mede neme t
                        tiny           real mother

                        big     man very
                        very big man
       (43)     u l wun wa ruke yapo r/mede/yan keyke

7.6    Nomi n a l s e ri a l i s a t i on
The Awtuw Noun phrase as I have analysed it here i s constrained as to the
amount of information it can accommodate . In particu lar , no Ad j ective Phrase
conta ins more than one adj ective . The question inevi tably arises as to how a
speaker modifies a noun when it is neces sary to attribute more than one
property to that noun .
The answer to this question resides in an explanation of the multiple NPs that
Rule 1 permi ts , and the mu ltiple nominal consti tuents that Rule 2 permits . I
have coined the term nomi n a l seri a l i sa ti on to describe this phenomenon .","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136]"

                               ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
While I am responsible for the analysis presented here and its organisation,
the data it is based upon belong to the Awtuw speaking people of Kamlakwlape,
Wutlakwlape , Wiyuplape , Tupumlape, and Kalaktuwlape .
I am most deeply indebted to the people of Meleylape , who allowed me to live in
their hamlet for fifteen months, who helped me in many ways, and who patiently
taught me their language . Among those who were most forthcoming were Yowmen,
Takiy, Poliw, Altiy, Awkay, Awtiy, Eykiy, Kampo, Keriy, Mimpel , Momoy, Naytow,
Osiy, Ruwmay, Wawpey, Yinow, Napeyre, Nimpiy. I am particularly grateful to
Kewmaey, Yawur, Yakop, and Napeyre, who allowed me to tape their narratives and
to Peyaw, Mimpel, and Ruwmay, who dictated stories to me . There is no way that
I can ever repay my debt to Yawur and Yakop, who helped me to transcribe texts
and provided virtually all of the elicited material I have used.
I am also grateful to the Institute of Papua New Guinea Studies, the Department
of Language at the University of Papua New Guinea, the Sandaun Provincial
Government, the Lumi District Office, and Kewmaey, Councillor for the Awtuw­
speaking area, for their permission to study Awtuw.
A large number of people deserve my thanks for the accommodation they so
graciously provided. Wietze Baron accommodated me at Ukarumpa. Paul of the
Lumi Police Detachment, Ian Bagley and other staff at Lumi High School , Father
Terry and others at St Mary' s Catholic Mission, and Kewmaey allowed me to stay
in their houses in Lumi . And Brian McClintock put me up in Port Moresby.
Leo Yimiten and Lumi District Office Staff helped me in a variety of ways and
made the 1980 census data available to me .
Val Lyon of the Department of Geography, Faculty of Arts at the Australian
National University was kind enough to draw the map.
Ger Reesink, Wietze Baron, Ken McElhanon, Les Bruce, and Dave Scorza of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (PNG Branch) discussed my proposed fieldwork
with me and provided me with access to some unpublished material in their
library.
Don Laycock, Cecil Brown, Bill Mitchell , and Keith Thomas corresponded with me
and encouraged me while I was in the field.
I would also like to thank Avery Andrews , Cliff Goddard, Ian Green, Walter
Seiler, Tim Shopen and David Wilkins for discussing my work with me, and Cliff
and David in particular for their valuable comments on draft chapters .
The Australian National University provided me with a generous scholarship
which made it possible to undertake this project at all .
Finally, my gratitude to Tanya and Adam McConvell for their support and
encouragement is unbounded.                                       iv

                                             The data upon which I base the description presented here was collected in the
                                             course of a field trip of 15 months' duration' (November 1979 February 1 9 8 1 )                                         -
                                             in the village of Kamnum, the largest of the five Awtuw-speaking villages .
                                             Insofar as possible I have gleaned examples from a small corpus of narrative
                                             text. But I have also used elicited examples to illustrate points where
                                             necessary.
                                             The content and structure of this description rest on a number of assumptions
                                             which I will attempt to make explicit.
                                              1 . 1 . 1 Language is a singularly prominent facet of culture in that it serves as
                                              the main repository and channel of communication of culture. But there are
                                              areas of linguistic structure that may in most cultures be described
                                              conveniently and without significant distortion as discrete from other aspects
                                              of culture.
                                              within the domain that is nuclear to language, there are a number of structural
                                              components that mediate between meanings to be conveyed and the acoustic code
                                              through which they are transmitted. These components are the proper subject of
                                              linguistic description.
                                              1 . 1 . 2 The physical properties of the acoustic code are marginal to linguistic
                                              description. Similarly, the nature of the relations between expressible
                                              meanings and cognitive processes on the one hand and external reality on the
                                              other, are marginal to the description of linguistic structure.
                                              within this periphery are three main structural components. The phonological
                                              component mediates between meaningful forms and the acoustic code through which
                                              they are transmitted. The lexical component mediates between lexical forms and
                                              expressible meanings. And the grammatical component organises the composition
                                              and combination of lexical forms , mediating, as it were , between the other two
                                              components .
                                              Viewed in this way, the grammatical component is central to linguistic structure.
                                              I intend here to present a comprehensive, even if not exhaustive , description
                                              of the morphology, syntax, and morphosyntax of Awtuw. Because Awtuw is a
                                              previously undescribed language, I include information on aspects of the
                                              language peripheral to my main concerns. Specifically, Chapter 1 places the
                                                                                                                                                          1

language in its social and sociolinguistic context, Chapter 2 provides an
overview of Awtuw's rich phonological and morphophonological system, Chapter   11
examines the structure of a few lexical fields of general interest, and Chapter
12 describes some paralinguistic phenomena.
1 . 1 . 3 The aims and methodology of linguistic theory and of linguistic
description are fundamentally different. The aim of theory is to delimit and
explain the functions of language in human society and human cognition. Its
methodology must therefore be to establish a set of explanatory principles that
will generate hypotheses about linguistic functions and the ways that languages
can express them. These hypotheses can then be tested against empirical data
about languages.
The aim of linguistic description is to identify the formal classes, categories ,
and structures of a language on empirical , language-internal evidence. Its
methodology must therefore be to examine and analyse such evidence and to
correlate the formal properties so isolated with their semantic functions.
In other words, it must describe language from the addressee's perspective
decoding forms into meanings, rather than from the speaker's perspective
encoding meanings into forms.
This is not to insist that every identifiable form is necessarily in a one-to­
one correspondence with a single meaning; we often encounter examples of
polysemy or structural ambiguity. But, as a heuristic, we do not expect a
mUltiplicity of forms to correspond to a single semantic category.
1 . 1 . 4 The approach taken in this description is therefore essentially
structuralist. I assume the utility of binary features and relative markedness
in distinguishing categories at all levels of structure. I further assume that
features used in a description should correspond to empirically identifiable
categories. Whenever possible, I have attempted to establish a correspondence
between formal categories and plausible semantic categories .
A feature-based analysis has two advantages . Features often cross-classify
such that a small set of formal/functional properties can distinguish a large
number of categories . It is also possible to make certain kinds of generalis­
ations regarding the properties of marked and unmarked categories.
For example, in the analysis of tense marking in Chapter 4, the feature
NONPRESENT at the same time distinguishes Present forms from Past forms, Future
from Desiderative, and Conditional from Frustrative. It also identifies the
morphologically unmarked Present with the semantically unmarked category of
non-NONPRESENT.
Throughout this description, I have aimed to express significant generalisations
intelligibly. When it seemed to further this aim, have borrowed formalisms
                                                    Ifrom Generative theory. I do not mean this to imply any credence in the claims
of the theory. The formalisms merely represent a handy and familiar convention
for schematising certain types of generalisations.
When a language is described in accordance with these principles, the hypotheses
generated by theory can be tested against the description. I have attempted
therefore to present an analysis that is empirically-based and relatively
theoretically neutral , and that reflects the structure of the language
faithfully.

1.2     Geography, gene t i c a ffi l i at i on, h i s to ry, a n d ethnogra phy
1.2.1     Awtuw is the first language of about 400 people living in five villages
between 142°29 ' and 142°3 1 ' East longitude and 3°3 4 ' and 3°3 6 South latitude in
an area of about 30 square kilometres in the southern foothills of the
Torricelli Range in north-western Papua New Guinea (see Map 1 ) . All five
villages are administered as part of the South-west Wapei Census Division of
the Lumi District, Sandaun (West Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea.
The five Awtuw-speaking villages are located at altitudes ranging from 3 2 0 to
400 metres above sea-level. Rainfall in Kamlakwlape, recorded from May to
December 1980 , ranged from a low of 7 1 . 5mm in June to a high of 2 3 7 . 7mm in
December. Temperatures range from 19 . 4° to 3 2 . 2° Celsius, with an average of
2 2 . 2° at 0600 and 29 . 4° at 1500 daily, with no appreciable seasonal variation.
Table 1.1 lists the five villages with their vernacular names, their names in
Tok Pisin, their populations in 1980 , and the names of the component hamlets.

of early 1981 , its inhabitants were planning to abandon it. The other four
hamlets of Kamlakwlape are clustered within five minutes' walk of each other.
Wutlakwlape' s three hamlets are closely clustered about 45 minutes' walk south­
east of Meleylape. Lalpinlape is about 25 minutes' walk south of Meleylape and
Kalpelape is another 10 minutes' walk south. The two hamlets of Tupumlape ,
located about two hours' walk south of Kalpelape , are adjacent to each other
and all the inhabitants of Kalaktuwlape , which is about two hours' walk south­
south-east of wutlakwlape , live in a single hamlet.

1 . 2 . 2 Laycock ( 19 7 3 ) has classified Awtuw as a member of the Ram ' Stock-level'
Fami ly . He further classif ies this fami ly within the Upper Sepik Super-stock
of the Sepik Sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu Phylum . Whi le the postulated broader
relationships are tentative , there is little doubt that the three Ram Fami ly
languages are c losely related ( c f . Laycock and Z ' Graggen 1977 , Wurm 197 1 ) .
Karawa , with some 53 speakers , is spoken in the vi llage of Bulawa , directly
south of the Awtuw-speaking area , and Bouye , with some 642 speakers , is spoken
in the villages of Giliato , Maurom , Wokien , and Yukilo to the south-west ( see

There is a variety of complex vowel harmony rules , described in 2 . 2 . 3 , 7 , 10 , 1 1 ,
16, which blur the di stinctions among vowels in certa in environments . Moreover ,
vowel gradation and reduction contribute to a blurr ing of distinctions . The
high and mid back vowe ls appear to be marginally phonemic .

Traditional ly , Awtuw has no formulaic greetings . The arrival of a person is
acknowledged by cal ling his or he r name , kinship term , or quasi-kinship term .
One does not of course address by name those aff ine s who are in a name taboo
re lationship with Ego ( c f . 1 1 . 1 . 7 ) . Nowadays Awtuw speakers wi l l typica l ly use
greetings borrowed from Tok Pisin and often even substitute Tok Pisin for
vernacular kin terms .
      ( 1)   g u t mon i n g n a u , O s i y/waway
             good morning now Osiy/mother 's brother
             good morning, Osiy/mother 's brother!
      (2)    a p i n un t r u , p o roma n /ye n a n keyke
             afternoon rea Z agemate/grandchi Zd
             good afternoon, agemate/grandchi Zd!
      (3)    gu tna i t n a u , y i y t a y/wa nnem
             goodnight now namesake
             goodnight, namesake !
The vernacular formula for parting is reyp apwo finished accompanied by the
addre ssee ' s name and optionally by an impe rative appropriate to what the
addre ssee i S , about to do . Tok Pisin greetings are in common use in this
context, but because there is a sati s fying vernacular alternative , they have

5. 1. 1The subj ect of a c lause has a number of propert ies that distinguish i t
from other grammatical relation s .
( 1 ) Fir s t , a s I mentioned above , the subj ect never bears case marking . But the
complementary nouns that co-occur obligatori ly with the idiomatic composite
verbs discussed in 5 . 4 never do so e i the r . Note that in clauses whose sub j ect
is a pronoun , a personal name , or an NP wi th any determiner or modifier , this
problem does not arise because the noun complement of idiomatic complement
constructions i s always a s ingle common noun .
A s imple subs titution test can distinguish the sub j ect in any clause where
there is a doubt as to its identif icat ion . The complementary noun in an
idiomatic composite construction is lexically specified . So if we substitute
                                                      87
88
an appropriate pronoun coreferential with the noun in question , and the clause
remains acceptable , we can be certain that that noun i s the subj ect of the
c laus e , I f such a substitution results in a n unacceptable c l ause , then w e can
identify the noun as a complementary noun .
     (1)    (a)   yam    yiw   d i - k - i yw ' - ey
                  chi ld water FA- Ip-bathe-Ip
                  a chi ld is bathing
            (b)   rev y i w d i - k - i yw ' - ey
                  3MS water FA-IP-bathe-IP
                  he is bathing

                   child 3MS FA- IP-bathe-IP
                  *chi ld he is bathing
( 2 ) Second , only the subj ect of the clause can trigger person agreement in
those verb forms - Hortative , Imperative , and Debitive - that are marked for
person . As first- and second-person subj ects , where overt , are always
pronominal , and therefore readily identifiable as subjects by the ir lack of
case markin g , I will i l lustrate with the third person form .
     (2)    (a)   yen-e vapor wa n - i re
                  2 SG-O man  DB- feed
                  the man has to feed you

                   2SG-O lSG DB- feed
                  *I have to feed you
( 3 ) Third , only dual and plural subj ects can trigger number agreement on the
verb . As number agreement is obligatory with these same three verb forms , I
wi l l again i l lustrate with debitive forms .
      (3)   (a)     y�n - worn ta l e wa n - puye

4 . Fourth, Awtuw refers to an antecedent through a variety of ava i lable
strategies . Among these are zero anaphora , an ordinary personal pronoun , an
emphatic pronoun , or an emphatic pronoun in combination with a reflexive
marker . Where the pragmatics of the verb of a second c lause are such that the
sub j ect of the preceding clau se is at least as l ikely to have performed the
action depicted in the second verb as the obj ect , then it w i l l be interpreted
as the antecedent for any of these strategies .
                                                                                               89
      (4)   Yawu r A l t i y - re d u - p u y- e , ( rey ( rey ( y i may ) ) ) d - u pow-ka

            Yawur hi t A ltiy and (Yawur) has run away
But where the pragmatics of the second verb are such that an obj ect of the
first clause is more l ikely to have performed i t than the subj ect , then that
obj ec t will be interpreted as the antecedent of a zero or ordinary personal
pronoun subj ec t in the second clau s e .
      (5)   Yawu r A l t i y - re d u - puy -e , ( rey ) f)ow d i -ye l - e
            Yawur A l tiy-o FA-hi t-p              3MS tear FA-cry-p
            Yawur hi t A ltiy and he (A ltiy ) cried
      (6)   Yawman Awt i y - re tawkway da- kow- 0 , ( re y ) d - i yp u d - ka
            Yawmen Awtiy-o tobacco FA-give-p           3MS FA-ro ll- PF
            Yawmen gave Awtiy tobacco and he (Awtiy ) has ro l led i t
This provides yet another example o f the importance in Awtuw grammar of real­
world considerations in compar ison to grammatical relation s . But the other two
anaphoric strategies do provide f irm evidence for a category of subj ect . When
the sub j ect of the second c lause is an emphatic pronoun , with or without an
accompanying reflexive marker , the antecedent is invariably interpreted as the
subj ect of the preceding clause , regardless of what pragmatic cons iderations
may seem to d ictate .
      (7)   Yawu r A l t i y- re d u - puy- e , rev - rev ( y i ma y ) f)ow d i -ye l -e

            Yawmen gave Awtiy tobacco and he, himself, has ro l led i t
( 5 ) Finally , in direct perception complements , the covert subj ect of the
complement may appear as the direct obj ect of the matrix clause . The obj ec t
         '
of the complement may n o t do so ( c f . 1 0 . 2 . 3 ) .

                  *I sme l led food being cooked by Numoy
                   I sme l led the food that Numoy was cooking5 . 1 . 2 When the direct obj ect is a pronoun or a personal name , where it i s
equal i n empathy t o the sub j ect , o r where the referents of the sub j e c t and the
obj ect are equally l ikely to have performed the action depicted in the clause
( see 6 . 1 ) , i t obl igatorily takes obj ect marking (cf . 6 . 2 ) . An indirect obj e ct
takes ob ject marking under all circumstances . So we can identify the common
noun or quantifier direct obj ect of a clause with a pronominal sub j e c t , because
the clause will be acceptable whether the direct obj ect has the object suffix
or not .
90
     (10)   t e y rame ( - re ) d u - p u y ' -a
            3FS man- 0          FA-hit- P
            she hit a man
By the same token , we can identify a common noun indirect object because the
clause will be unacceptable if we remove its object suffix .
     (11)   (a)    tey rame- re t awkway d a - kow- 0
                   3FS man- 0 tobacco FA-give-p
                   she gave a man tobacco
            ( b ) * tey rame t awkway da- kow- 0
                    3FS man tobacco FA-give-p
                  *she gave a man tobacco
But we will need to apply another substitution test to identify pronominal and
personal name direct obj ects in clauses wi th common noun subj ects , in other words ,
where the direct ob j ect is higher in empathy than the subj ect . In such clauses ,
pronominal and personal name direct obj ects take obligatory object marking and
are therefore indi stinguishable from indirect obj ects on formal grounds wi thout
reference to information about the meaning of the verb . We cannot substi tute a
human common noun , because it will nece s sarily be equal to or higher than the
sub j ect in empathy , and therefore still require object marking . Thus we can
substitute a non-human common noun for the pronoun or personal name in que s tion .
If the substituted common noun s t i l l requires ob ject marking , then it must be
an indirect obj ect . If the clause is acceptable whether the substituted common
noun bears object marking or not , then i t i s a direct ob j ect .

Note that ( 1 2b-d) are grammatical whether or not the direct ob ject ( p i y ren in
( 1 2b ) and reye in ( 1 2 c-d ) ) has object marking . But the clause becomes
ungrammatical when the indirect obj ect is unmarked , as il lustrated in ( 1 2e ) .","[93, 94, 95, 96]"

4. 7.3   The next step is to d istingui sh forms specified as Negative from those
specified as non-Negative , for both Debitive and non-Debitive categories . Thi s
feature dist inguishes Negative Debitive forms with the prefixes a p - and ni 1 -
from non-Negative Debitive forms with the pre fixes pa - , k a n - , and wan - . I t
also distinguishes among non-Debitive , non-Potential forms . Again , the
position of the pre fixes that mark the categories make Potential and Negative
mutua l ly exclus ive .
Thi s leaves a three-way distinction among Potential forms with the pre f ix n a - ,
Negative non-Potential forms with the pref ix ka - , and non-Negative non-Potential
forms with no pre f ix in s lot - 8 . The morpho logical and semantic unmarkedness
of the non-Negative non-Potential j u stif ies naming the feature Negative rather
than Affirmative .
An i llustrative diagram at this point may serve to c larify the distinctions
proposed thus far .                                                         v                              -Debitive                                 +Debitive                �-Potential               +Potential

restrictions on their co-occurrence , di stinguish a l l the prefixes in slot -8 ,
with the exception of person mark ing of Debitive forms .
At this stage , it will be most convenient to focus on further specif ications
to the left-most , non-Potential , non-Debitive branch of the diagram and return
to the Potential and the Debitive branches later .
                                                                                         63
Forms on this branch distingui sh Nonfactivity as marked in slot - 7 . A lthough
the Nonfactive prefix w- and the Factive prefix d- both make more than one
tense di stinction , it is preferable to identify Nonfactive as the marked form
for the purpose of this analy s i s .
S ince non-Debitive , non-Potential forms make precisely the same distinctions
regardless of their spec i f i cation for Negativity , further d i scussion w i l l be
neutral with respect to Negativity .
Nonfactive and non-Nonfactive forms distinguish tense through the feature
Nonpresent . Nonfactive forms spec i fied Nonpresent bear the Future suffix
and those specif ied non-Nonpresent bear the Desiderative suff ix . Non-Nonfactive
forms specif ied Nonpresent have past tense mark i ng , whi le those speci fied
non-Nonpresent are unmarked for tense .
This feature Conditional dist ingui shes forms with the Conditional suffix in
slot +4 from those that lack it. Condi tional forms are redundantly speci f ied
as Nonfactive . Thus non-Nonfactive forms wil l automatically be specif ied as
non-Conditional , while Nonfactive forms distingui sh Conditional and non­
Conditiona l .
Thi s analys i s conveniently specifies Conditional forms , which occur i n past
contrafactual condition s , as Nonfactive , Nonpresent , and Conditional , and
Frustratives , which depict frustrated de s i re s , as Nonfactive , non-Nonpresen t ,
and Conditional . Note that the only marker from s lot +5 that may co-occur with
the Conditional suf f ix i s the Desiderative suff ix .
I t is now appropriate to d i splay another diagram to c larify the feature
specif ications made thus far and the i r correspondence with verb suffixes .

4.7.5    Now we can turn our attention to forms specified as Potential .
Potential forms require Nonfactive marking and may bear either the Future
or the Conditional suffix. Redundancy rule 1 yields all possible forms under
this node.
    ( 4 8 ) Redundancy rule 1
            [+potential ] [+NonfactiveJ
                         -+
                              +Nonpresent
Note that Potential forms must also be non-Debitive and non-Negative , but
because all three categories, potential, Debitive, and Negative are expressed
by affixes in the same slot, the redundancy rule need not specify it.
Potential forms may still be specified for Conditionality. Potential
Conditionals take the Conditional suffix and Potential non-Conditionals take
the Future suffix, as was the case with non-Potential forms specified as
Nonfactive and Nonpresent.
4.7.6   Two additional redundancy rules will specify the mood and tense values
for Debitive forms. The first of these stipulates that Negative Debitives will
also be Nonfactive and Nonpresent, and so have Future marking, and

                                       Imperfective. In other words , forms with
any Debitive or tense marking may bear     either Perfect or Imperfective marking,
or be unmarked for aspect, while non-Debitive     forms unmarked for tense must
bear either the Perfect or the Imperfective suffix.

They exhibit three categories of number and three of person with a female/
non-female d i s t inction in the third person s ingular .
Whi l e there is a degree of suppletion in the paradigm , we can make a few
correlations between forms and the categories that they mark . The most
striking regularity is that the plural forms con s i stently end in the segments
lom/ . A s imilar regularity occurs in the first and second person dual forms ,
which both end in lan/ . The first person dual and plural forms both begin with
In l , while the corresponding second person forms begin in a vowe l . Final l y ,
the third person dual and plural forms , as well as the unmarked third person
s ingular , have an initial I r / .

Wurm ( 1 9 7 7 a ) has drawn attention to a remarkable consistency among the diverse
languages of New Guinea in the forms of certain personal pronouns . Examining
the s ingular forms in all three persons and the first and second person plural s ,
h e finds that most of the pronouns marking these categories throughout New
Guinea fall into one of three basic sets and that a given language wi l l often
select most of its pronouns from the same set or in a predictable way from two
or a l l three set s . Because the pronominal forms in a given set crop up over a
geographically large area and in no way restrict themselves to s ingle genetic
groupings , Wurm concludes that personal pronouns are , contrary to popular
opinion , commonly borrowed from language to language .
Awtuw ' s personal pronouns are quite consi stent in their set membership . The
second person plural form bears no resemblance to the pronouns in any of the
sets Wurm has establ i shed . But the other four categories a l l display Set I
feature s .
One of the postulated Set I forms for third person singular i s / te / , which
resembles the corresponding female form in Awtuw quite c losely . There i s a l so
a predictable consonant alternation , character istic of Set I pronouns signal l ing
the gender distinction in the third person s ingular . A property of second
person s i ngular forms in Set l aX appears to end in a coronal consonant and
begin with a /y/ , as does the Awtuw form /ye n / . S imilar l y , Set I first person
forms typica lly contain an / n / , while Set X forms add to this a /wV - / in the
s ingular , and an /-m/ in the plura l , yie lding the Awtuw forms /wa n / and / nom/ .
Personal pronouns have a somewhat different set of morphological properties
from nouns , demonstratives , and interrogatives . With regard to the suff ixes
they may accept , nouns marked for number resemble personal pronouns . In other
respects , however , personal pronouns are unique .
First of a l l , only personal pronouns may bear the Possessive suffix -ke ,
described in 6 . 3 . Second , the Obj ect suffix on personal pronouns has the
canonical form -e , subj ect to vowe l harmony ( cf . 2 . 2 . 1 0 ) , and does not exhibit
the sex gender agreement characteristic of the corresponding suffix on other
substantive lexemes . And third , personal pronouns may never bear the Locative/
Direction suffix -e/ke , described in 6 . 5 .

I n addition to the properties they share with number-marked nouns , personal
pronouns have three dis tinctive morphosyntactic characteristics .
Personal pronouns take the suffix - yffin to form what we may call Emotive
pronouns . These are u sed when the speaker wants to e l icit sympathy for the
referent of the suffixed pronoun .
     ( 2 2 ) wa n - Yffin i m koko t d - i k - a l -    e
             ISG-EMT night a l l     FA-sit-unti l dawn-p
             pOOl"" me had to sit up a l l night
I n origin , this suffix i s very probably a diminutive . I t is homophonous with
the noun yffin chi ld, which compounds fair ly productively with other nouns to
denote the young of an animal or a sma l l token of the type denoted by the bare
noun .

Second , personal pronouns may reduplicate in full to form what I c a l l Emphatic
pronouns . Such forms have two bas i c functions - to emphasise an argument ,
usua l ly in contrastive s i tuations , and to s ignal coreference with the preceding
subj ect . In thi s latter case , emphatic pronouns bear the possess ive suffix
when the possessor i s coreferential with the subj ect , bear the reflexive marker
44
' when the direct or indirect obj ect is coreferential with the subj ect , and mark
  the subj ect of a succeeding clause , with or without the ref lexive marker , to
  mark it unambiguously as coreferential with the preceding subject ( c f . 5 . 1 ,
  10 . 6 ) .

Note that as the examples above i l lustrate , emphatic pronouns take the same
suff ixes as ordinary personal pronouns . But they dif fer in two respects - they
may not take yren and they may not themselves reduplicate .","[47, 48, 49, 50]"

In this construction , the verb marked wi th - re may bear any tense marke r and
may carry a full set o f arguments and adj uncts . This strategy has three maj or
functions . It is used for inferential perception complements , for indirect
discourse complements , and for indirect cognition complements .
Whatever the semantic function , c lauses of this sort have in common the feature
that the tense of the complement is relative to the tense of the matrix verb .
Thus , if the matrix verb i s present , i . e . unmarked, then an unma rked complement
verb re fers to an event contemporaneous with the speech event , a past
complement verb to an event prior to it, and a future complement verb to an
event subsequent to it .

Simi larly , i f the matrix verb i s past , then an unmarked complement verb re fers
to a contemporaneous event , a past complement verb to a prior event , and a
future complement verb to a subsequent event .

                     he said that they would be baking a pig
And if the matrix verb is future , then the tense marking of the complement verb
again refers to time with relation to the time of the matrix verb .
     (32)      (a)   rey rom yaw d i - k - i twa r - e - m - r e mak - re

                     he wi l l say that they wi l l be baking a pig (after he says i t )
A perfect form in the complement has much the same semantic e f fect as a pe r fect
form in an independent clause . In the latter case it may refer to an event
completed prior to the speech event , in the former , to an event completed prior
to the time indicated by the tense of the complement verb , which is determined
in turn by the tense of the matrix verb .
In example ( 3 4 ) each perfect complement verb indicates that the baking is
complete at the time referred to by the tense . So in ( 3 4a ) , the unmarke d
tense of the complement verb refers to a time contemporaneous with the time
of �� � say .  In ( 34b) , the past tense of the l ! �� r bake refers to a time prior
to the time of the matrix verb , and the perfect indicates that the baking was
completed at that time . And in example ( 34c ) , the perfect of the complement
verb indicates that the baking will be complete at the time referred to by the
future .

The same kinds of interpretation app ly to complements of matrix verbs in other
tense s . The glosses i n example ( 3 5 ) are not precisely equivalent to the Awtuw
they g loss . Example ( 3 5a ) means that they will have finished baking the pig at
a t ime subsequent to the time he said it, which i s o f course prior to the time
of the speech event . Example ( 35b ) means that at some time before he says it ,
they will have finished baking the pig .

As is common in comparable constructions in other languages , there is also a
relativity of person in the complement, because the narrator relates the act
of perception , speech , or cognition from his or her own point o f view . So , for
example , i f Takiy utters the sentence in example ( 3 6 ) to Yawur , Yawur would
report the speech to Napeyre as in example [ 36a J and to Takiy as in example
[ 36b J .
      ( 36 ) ' wa n Napey re - t e tawkway kow- re '
               lSG Napeyre-o tobacco give-Fu
             'I ' l l give Napeyre some tobacco '
      [ 36 J   [aJ   Tak i y wa n - e yen-e t awkway kow- r e - r e da -mak-e

1 . Perception verbs take this type o f complement in the sense that the
perception enables the subj ect to infer the situation depicted by the
complement . Thus Kampo in example ( 3 7 ) did not actua l ly observe his father
going , but his observations enabled him to surmise that his father had gone .
      (37)     Kampo rey- rey - ke I)awa r d - a3y - ka y -e- re d - uwp -o
               Kampo 3MS-3MS-PS father FA-gO-PF- p-o FA-see-p
               Kampo saw that his father had gone
2 . The two speech verbs also take this construction , as illustrated in the
preceding examples and here in ( 38 ) .
      ( 38 )   wan ( Nay tow- re ) Yawu r ma3W - e d - a3y-e - re da-mak-e
               lSG (Nay tow- ) Yawur bush-L FA-go-P-O FA-say-p
               I to ld (Nay tow) whether Yawur went to the bush
The interpretation of the complement is as indirect speech - the speaker merely
reports the narrated speech event , and does not attempt to reproduce it .
                                                                                                        163
3. Al l the cognition verbs , including the preference verbs , can enter into this
construction .
         ( 39 )   t e y Awt i y Treyp i l - e w- ewr ' - eya- re- re nenren d i - k - l ay - e y - e
                  3 F S Awtiy Ta lbipi-L NF-AGN- come-FU-O thought FA- IP-bear- IP-p
                  she Was thinking that Awtiy would return from Ta lbipi
Complements of this type often occur sentence f inally with the ir subj ect
appearing as the direct obj ect o f the matrix verb . Perception and cognition
verbs can take this construc tion , pre ference and speech verbs do not .

                        *he said that Numoy went to Lumi
This construction does not permit the complement subj ect to occur as a
posse ss ive pronoun .

Awtuw uses a superficially simi lar strategy t o form cause and result clause s .
The se c lauses may also have obj ect marking on the verb and pos sess ive marking
on the embedded subj ect . But their subj ects never occur as the direct obj ect
of the matrix verb and the tense of the embedded clause i s not relative to the
tense of the matrix clause .

10. 2 . 7   Rel a t i ve c l a u s e s
Relative clauses have much the same structure as the complements discus sed in
the preceding paragraphs . Relative clauses typically occur between a
determiner and a noun , and while there is no restriction on the ir tense , the
most common relative clauses are those with an imperfective verb unmarked for
tense a s in example (44a ) .
        ( 44 )   (a)     rev k i 1  d a - k - a l ow- ey - re rame l a kna-kay

This same strategy is used to re lativise all positions on the NP Acces sibility
Hierarchy except posse ssives ( Keenan and Comrie 197 7 , 1 9 7 9 ) . Examples ( 4 4 a ) and
( 44 c ) i l lustrate relativi sation on a subj ect , and ( 4 4b ) , on a source of getting

comitative , ( 45e ) on an instrument , and ( 4 5 f ) on a locative .

                   the house the boys used to s leep in has fal len down
Another strategy leaves a re sumptive pronoun in the relative c lause . This
strategy relativises all positions on the Hierarchy including posse s s ives , a s
shown in example ( 4 6 ) .
     (46)    r e y rey-ke p i y ren wan - e d - re l - i - re rarne l a k n a - ka y

             the man whose dog bit me has died
In yet another strategy , the head noun takes case marking appropriate to its
role in the relative clause . Thi s construction can also relativise a l l
positions except posse ssives .
     (47 )   (a)   tey Yawu r ffiwre d - u y - kow- kay- re ta l e - re w- eya- re
                   3FS Yawur house-FA-build-BEN-PF- 0 woman-O NF-come -FU

                   the axe I fe l led the tree with is very sharp
It is possible to summarise the attributes of the three constructions in terms
of two principles :
     1 . A resumptive pronoun must carry possessive marking when relativising
         on a possessive NP .
     2 . The head noun may bear the case marking o f the position from wh ich it
         was relativi sed when there i s no resumptive pronoun .
The head noun of any relative clause may occupy any syntactic pos i tion in the
matrix clause , as illustrated in example ( 4 8 ) .

A relative clause can follow the head noun with appos itional intonation and
non- re strictive sense , a matter I have di scussed in 7 . 6 .

10. 3    Adverb i a l construct i o n s
An  adverbial construction marks the verb o f the embedded clause with the
instrumental/comitative suffix - re - k . The verb in such a c lause se lects a l l
verbal categories but tense a n d il locutionary force independently o f the matrix
c lause and has its own set of arguments and adj uncts . Its tense is relative to
the tense of the matrix verb .
The subject of a verb marked as instrumental may appear with pos se s s ive
marking .

                 we have gone on ta�king since you arrived
Sequence of tense s in this construction is quite different from the sequence of
tenses described above in section 10 . 2 . 5 . Here an embedded verb must either
bear the same tense marker as the matrix verb , or no tense marking at all .
A matrix verb o f any tense may embed a verb unmarked for tense .

A future matrix verb may also embed a future form, and a past matrix verb can
embed a past form.

As I mentioned in section 4 . 12 , Awtuw ' s abi lity to code a variety of a spectual
and adverbial categories in compounding roots and elsewhere in the verb comp lex
compensate s for its lack of conj unctions . The se categor ies , along with regular
a spe ct marking and the adverbial prefixes in slots -5 and -4 , make it pos s ible
to form a wide variety of temporal c lause s .
An embedded clause with imperfective marking is typically interpreted as a
whi le-c lause . The adverbial pre f i x t aw- sti l l can reinforce this
interpretation .

               you arrived in the vi l lage whi le we were s ti l l cooking food
An imperfective matrix verb and an embedded perfect verb result in a structure
analogous to an un ti l-clause . This interpretation is strengthened by the
addition of the compounding root !�� - begin to the matrix verb .

And an embedded past verb combines with an �y serialisation ( see 10 . 1 . 2 ) with
perfect marking to form a since-clause .

10 . 4   C o nd i t i o n a l construct i o n s
Awtuw has two types o f conditional sentence s . Future conditionals have verbs
marked for future in both the protasis and the apodosis , as in ( 6 1 ) , and
contrafactual conditionals have verbs marked as conditional in both c lauses , a s
in ( 6 0 ) and ( 6 2 ) . In e i ther case , there i s a strict constraint that the two
inte rdependent clause s bear the same marking for tense and modality, although
each verb selects aspect , direction , and negative marking independently .
Moreove r , each verb carries an independent set of arguments and adj uncts .

10 . 5   Co-ordi na ted c l a u s e s
In addition t o the various seriali sation and subordination strategies described
in the preceding sections , Awtuw can concatenate fully independent c lauses .
One such clause is never embedded in the othe r , nor may either clause bear case
marking . Each clause is always entirely acceptable on its own .
Unl ike the previously described strategies , where the tense of the verb in one
c lause was dependent upon the tense of the other - either determined by the
construction , or re lative to the time of the matrix verb , the tense of each
c lause in co-ordinate constructions is independent of the other . The tense of
every verb has absolute time reference .
Furthermore , the clauses in these constructions are independent with respect to
i l l ocutionary force . One c lause may be in a debitive or potential modal i ty ,
or be a question , while the other i s not .

adverbs thus . Unlike indirect di scourse complements , they never take case
marking or occur clause medial ly . Tense and pe rson are not relative to the
tense and person in the matrix clause .

In any o f the constructions discussed above that d o not entai l spe c i f ic
co-re ference constraints , the possibility of confusion arise s . Awtuw
compensates for this in large measure pragmatically by interpreting the
antecedent of a deleted NP as the most plausible NP available .

                Kamp o h i t Poytin and she cried
In this case the antecedent of the mis sing NP in the second c lause is
inte rpreted as the obj ect o f the first - Poytin got hit , so she must be the
one who cried .
When two or more NPs are equally l ikely candidates for the role of antecedent
of a de leted NP , the default interpretation is that it is the subject of the
preceding clause .

When the antecedent is the subj ect of the preceding clause , but it is not the

(cf . 5 . 1 . 1) .

4.6   Aspect mark i n g
The Awtuw verb di splays marking for two aspects - Perfect and Imperfective . The
Perfect is marked by a suf fix in s lot +2 , and the Imperfective by a c ircumf ix ,
the suffixal component of which appears in s lot +2 . The prefixal component
appears in s lot - 2 . Except when the verb is in a truncated verb seriali sation ,
both components of the Imperfective c ircumfix must co-occur ( see 1 0 . 1 . 2 ) .

The Imper fective marker appear s o n verbs depicting a situation that i s durative ,
continuous , progressive , or iterative in nature .

4.7        Fea t u re a n a l ys i s o f moda l i ty , ten s e , and a s pect catego r i e s
The preceding sections have mentioned a variety o f co-occurrence restrictions
among the affixes that may appear in the Awtuw verb complex . A simple statement
of positional restrict ions can account for some o f these . A verb may not be
spec ified , for example , as both Negative and Potential because once the
Negative prefix has occupied s lot -8 , the Potential prefix cannot do so , and
vice versa .
A number of co-occurrence restrictions apply to affixes that f i l l different
s lot s . The purpose of this section is to submit the relevant morphemes to an
analysis that assign s a set of feature speci fications to each and stipulates
the i r co-occurrence poss ibi lities in terms of a set of redundancy rules .
We w i l l be primarily concerned with the categories of tense , aspect , and mood ,
represented in verbal affixes in s lots - 8 , -7 , -2 , +2 , +4 , and +5 . There w i l l
also b e reason t o touch o n the category o f person , which i s represented i n
Awtuw onl y as a portmanteau o f the Debitive modal ity prefixes , and number .
S ince no co-occurrence restrictions apply to the other categories marked by verb
morphology , it w i l l be unnecessary to analyse them in thi s way .
Three features dist ingu i sh the categor ies of modal ity marked in s lot - 8 . The
feature Debitive distinguishes forms marked with p a - , kan - , wa n - , a p - , and n i 1 -
from those marked with n a - , k a - , or ¢ . Potential distinguishe s those marked
with n a - from tho se marked with k a - or ¢ . Negative distinguishes those marked
with ka- from unmarked forms on the one hand , and those marked with pa - , kan - ,
and wa n - from those marked with a p - and n i l - on the other .
The feature Nonfactive distinguishes forms marked with w- in s lot -7 from
those that do not bear the Nonfactive pre fix . As I mentioned in the discussion
above , Factive and Nonfactive marking is conditioned by tense . This makes the
non-Factive feature useful in the spec i f ication of the tense suffixes as wel l
as the Factive and Nonfactive prefixes . Specifical ly , the feature
distinguishes Future and Desiderative forms from Past and unmarked forms .
The purpose of this analysis is to describe co-occurrence restrictions on overt
morphemes . The features therefore corre spond directly with morphological
categor ies . Ideal ly , a feature mediates between a morphologically marked
category and a corresponding semantic category . S ince the morphological
category of Nonfactivi ty i n Awtuw i s semantically redundant , specifications
of forms for thi s feature may at times seem arbitrary .
The feature Nonpresent distinguishes Past and Future forms , which are overtly
marked and have Nonpresent time reference from Desiderative forms and forms
unmarked for tense , which have present time reference .
Fina l l y , the features Conditional , Perfect , Imperfective , Second Person , Third
Person , P lural , and Dual are morphologically and semantically transparent .
Since the categories o f aspect , person , and number i n Awtuw a l l make three-way
d i st inction s , a pair of features is required for each .","[65, 66, 67]"

1 . 2 . 4 The people of the region largely subsist in an economy dominated by
sago production . Sago is at once the staple of their diet and their f avourite
food ( c f . Wark and Malcolm 1969) . Moreover , sago fronds trep are used for
thatch and the stalks of these fronds , madow (TP mo ra i ta ) , are used in the
construction of wall s , doors , and beds .
The sago diet is supplemented by a small amount of garden produce - mainly
n i yame l yam, t a l ow taro , wom coconut , and amak pandanus-and occasional game ,
fish , or domestic pig.
All gardening and hunting tasks fall to the men , whi le sago production is the
exclusive domain of women . The men clear their gardens by burning them off and
hunt with r i py ' - a l me bows and arrows or shotguns .
Awtuw-speakers , like most of their countrymen , are inveterate chewers of �y
bete lnut and smokers of t awkway tobacco. The gardens of the Awtuw-speaking
vil lages produce more betelnut , tobacco , and rep i t daka pepper than the people
require , and the main source of cash income derives from the sale of these
commodi ties at the weekly market in Lumi . In the two southernmost vil lages ,
Tupum and Kalaktuw , where game is more plentiful , meat and occas ional ly
kat i ok+wa te wi ldfowl eggs , or even re l rewye +wa te crocodi le eggs are brought to
market.
Throughout the area , settlement is in small villages , most of them consisting
of a cluster of smaller hamlets , with populations of between five and 50 . Each
hamlet generally consists of two paral lel lines of houses , with more houses at
either end , all facing into a cleared central area . In some cases , houses or
sma l l patches of garden may intrude into the centre of the hamlet . In hamlets
occupied by more than one lineage , the members of each lineage tend to l ive in
adj acent houses .
Houses themse lve s are invariably built o f madow and thatched with trep . Some
are bui lt on the ground and others are rai sed on stilts of y i y l e ka l kwi la
wood . The f loors of rai sed houses are made of wud p i r (TP l i ""mbum) b lack palm.
More e laborate housing involves the use of p l a ym mats of woven, flattened
                                                                                     7
bamboo in walls and occasionally windows . The typical house i s between five
and eight metres square , with a door at either end and no windows . The area
between the two doors is c lear , and between two and three small ' rooms ' flank
this corridor on either side . The rooms are separated by wal l s of madow about
1 . 5 metres high and each contains two parallel benches of madow set perpendicu­
lar to the s ide wal l s of the house . The benches are about 50 cm high and wide
and between 150 cm and 200 cm long . Between each pair of benches is a cleared
area about one metre wide where a fire may be bui l t .
Generally , a nuclear fami ly , consisting of a married couple , their unmarried
daughters and sma l l sons , and sometimes the husband ' s widowed parent , wi l l
occupy each house. Boys move into a separate house with their age-mates at
about the age of ten and remain in such a household unti l they marry , between
the ages of about 25 and 3 0 , when they build their own houses and establish
thei r own households in the husband ' s hamlet .
The spouses share the housework and care of chi ldren . Men usually undertake
such tasks as cutting grass , while the women sweep out the house and collect
firewood and water . Men cook all meat and most garden crops , and the women
take on responsibili ty for preparing most of the sago .
The speakers of the ma jority dialect of Awtuw ( see 1 . 3 ) share most cultural
traits with their Torricelli language speaking neighbour s to the west , north ,
and eas t . The speakers of the southern dialect are much more c losely
affiliated with their neighbours to the south . The dialect boundary that
segregates the people of Kamlakw, Wutlakw , and Wiyup from those of Kalaktuw and
Tupum is also the southern limit of the �a l e-wokaw Devi lfish ceremony .
On the other hand , the restriction on game consumption defines a cultural
continuum stretching from the Sepik River a long the Yellow and Wiytape Sibi
Rivers up into the highest vil lages in the Torricell i s . At the southern end of
the continuum , the restriction on consuming the game one shoots extends to all
members of the hunter ' s patril ine and his wife . In the Awtuw- speaking area ,
only the hunter , his father , brothers , and sons may not eat his game . Further
north , only the hunter himself is restricted from eating his game . Still
further along , the hunter may eat his own game . This continuum corresponds ,
perhaps coincidentally , with the density of settlement and concomitant scarc ity
of game .
The three villages that speak the maj ority dialect of Awtuw are distinct from
any of their neighbours with respect to certain cultural traits . For example ,
in this area , people do not eat dog meat , on which there is no restriction in
the surrounding area . Women and chi ldren in these vil lages do not eat fresh
fish .
As I mentioned above , the �a l e -wokaw ceremony , ce lebrated throughout the Wapei
area , stretches only as far south as Wiyup . The other two maj or ceremonies , the
wokaw Malangan and kepne TUmbuan , encompass the entire area . All of these
ceremonies , as wel l as the minor ceremonies that are restricted to a locality ,
are closely involved with therapeusi s . Although these ceremonies have a
variety of politica l , economic , artistic , mu sical , and religious funct ions , the
explicit motivation for performing any ceremony is always diseas e . performing
the appropriate ceremony propitiates the spirit responsible for causing the
disease , who then removes it .

1.3   Soc i o l i ng u i s t i c s
The Sepik region as a whole , and the Lumi District i n particu lar , are
l inguistically very diverse ( Laycock 1968 , 197 3 ) . Of the roughly 3 0 , 000
inhabitants of the District , over 10 , 000 are speakers of 010, a Torricelli
Phylum language with over 1 5 , 000 speakers , some of them in other administrative
area s . The remaining 2 0 , 000 people speak 2 1 other language s . With 400
speakers , Awtuw i s larger than many of the surrounding languages .
Such diversity , combined with a general rule of local exogamy , engenders a
re latively astounding degree of multilingualism. Typically , an 010 speaker
married to another 010 speaker will speak only 010 and Tok P i s in . But speakers
of any of the smal ler languages will usua lly speak 010 and Tok P i s in , in
add ition to their f irst language . I f an individual ' s parents speak different
language s , he or she is l ikely to speak at least four . Husbands who do not
speak the ir wife ' s language usually learn it , and wives who do not speak their
husband ' s language always do . People with relations or other contacts further
afield commonly speak as many as seven or eight languages .
Children in the Awtuw-speaking area start to learn Awtuw and Tok Pisin at the
same time . By the age of three or four they express themselves more comfortably
in Awtuw , but they become genuinely f luent in Tok Pisin by the age of f ive ,
whi l e it may take another three to five years to master Awtuw entire ly . By
that time the child will have also learned a modicum of 010 and of other
languages that he or she comes into contact with .
Because Awtuw-speaking women marry into villages that do not speak Awtuw , there
are a number of Awtuw speakers outside the five v i l lages . Naturally , such
Awtuw-speaking women continue to speak Awtuw themselves and the ir chi ldren a lso
speak Awtuw . What strikes one as interesting is that their husbands usual ly
learn it as wel l . That adults continue to learn Awtuw as a second language
indicates that the language remains vital and is likely to continue to thrive .
There are Awtuw- speaking populations in the fol lowing villages ( see Map 1 ) :                                Tab l e 1 . 2 : V i l l a ges wi th Awtuw s peakers                              VILLAGE         (TOK PISIN NAME )           LANGUAGE

As I mentioned above , Awtuw , a lthough it has so few speakers , has more than one
dialect . In fact , there are three - the Southern diale c t , the Witit dialect ,
and the maj ority dialect that I describe in this grammar . The Southern dialect ,
spoken in the two southernmost v i l lage s , Kalaktuw and Tupum , has two very
distinct phonological features . First , it has completely neutralised the
distinction made in the maj ority dialect between I rl and III in favour of the
I l l . And second , it has replaced the word- initial I Q I of the major ity dialect
with 1 7 / . Thus I r a re re l want to eat in the maj ority dialect is I l a l e l el in the
Southern dialec t , and IQa l e l fish becomes 1 7 a l e/ .
The witit dialect i s spoken by only one l i neage i n the hamlet o f Witi tlape in
Kamlakw. It is distinguished from the maj ority dialect in replacing word­
initial IQI with In / . Thus I Qalel fish becomes In a l e/ , homophonous with I n a l el
ho Ze .
Interestingly , the neutral isation of I rl and III and of IQI and I n l are two
features of child language as well as the main indicators of dialect
dif ferences.

structure . Its phonology and espec ially its morphophonology are enormously
rich and fully deserve a thorough and comprehensive description . But as I
mentioned in 1 . 1 . 2 , this work is a description of Awtuw grammatical st�ucture
and I have therefore constrained the chapter on phonology to a minimum . The
aim of this chapter is to provide the reader with a brief overview of Awtuw
segmental phonology and some of the major morphophonological rules .","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"
9 . 2 . 1 Morphological negation with k a - / k�- is the usual strategy for negating
any clause with a verbal predicate .
      (21)     Awt i y k�-w- �y - re
               Awtiy NG-NF-go-FU
               Awtiy isn ' t going

               Awtiy-o lSG NG-FA-See- PF
               I haven ' t seen Awtiy
This strategy may be used to contrast verbs , verb phrase s , or subjects ,
although it is more common to find yene negating constituent s .
      (23)     N u moy k�- d - k - �y - e y , r e v po d - i k i y
               Numoy NG-FA- IP-go- IP 3MS PCL FA-s tay

               Numoy didn ' t hit A l tiy, he fed me
Morphological negation cannot contrast obj ects or other full constituent s , but ,
oddly , it can contrast adj ectiva l constituents of the object .

               I didn ' t see a new house, I saw an o ld house
9 . 2 . 2 The negative particle yene may negate any constituent of the clause that
it precede s , including the verb . Because ye ne is assoc iated with a particular
constituent , it frequently has somewhat more of a contrastive force than a
negation of the entire clause using the morphological strategy . Compare , for
e xample , example ( 2 9 ) with example ( 2 6 ) above .
      (29)     wan yene Yawman - re d u - p uy - e , wan Naytow- re d u - p uy - e
               lSG NG     Yawmen-O FA-hit-p lSG Nay tow-o FA-hit-p

There i s a similar contrast between examples ( 30 ) and ( 2 7 ) .

9 . 2 . 3 When y e n e negate s a morphologica l ly negative verb , the meaning of the
resulting double negation inc ludes both negatives . The morphological negative
is in the scope of yene , which cance ls rather than emphasises its meaning .

3 . 8 . 1 The suffix - neney i s enormous ly productive and regularly forms
apparently nonce express ions from any e l igible noun , i . e . any common noun .
Its basic meaning would appear to be to attribute the noun bearing the suffix
as a property or posses sion of the noun that the derived adj ective mod i f ie s .
The examples i n ( 3 8 ) illu strate these two meanings .
      ( 38 )   (a)     neknek-   neney
                       knowledge-y
                       c lever
               (b)     ffiW re- neney
                       house-y
                       having a house
               (c)     YffiY+ t i w- neney
                       skin+hair-y .
                       hairy
               (d)     yen kay- neney
                       husband-y
                       married (of woman)
Another important function of thi s suffix is to take up the s lack left by
Awtuw ' s closed class of adj ectives . Unl ike many other languages with closed
adj ective classes , many of the gaps in the inventory of basic adj ectival
50
meanings are filled not by nouns or verbs ( cf . Schachter to appear p . 1S ) , but
rather by derived adj ectives with - n eney .
     (39)      (a)   t a pwo- neney
                     fire- y
                     hot
               (b)   n ampe t - neney

                     cold
               (c)   y i w- neney ( c f . rey 1 e dry )
                     water-y
                     wet, fu l l of water
3 . 8 . 2 As noted above , - kwo/-wo has a number of functions . The distribution of
the two a llomorphs appears to be lexically conditioned . Perhaps most important
among these is the derivation of colour terms . Section 1 1 . 2 contains further
discussion of colour terminology .
      ( 4 0)   (a)   t i p ra y - kwo
                     soot- like
                     b lack
               (b)   reyp i y- kwo
                     b lood- like
                     red
               (c)   nene 1 - wo
                     unripe- like
                     green
Examples ( 40a) and ( 40b) il lustrate the derivation of ad j ectives from nouns and
( 40c) il lustrate s the derivation of an adj ective from another adj ective .
Another important function of this suffix is to derive an extremely common
adj ective .
      (41)           1 um-wo
                     fat- like
                     s low, easy
Thi s suffix may be added to any adj ective to fudge its meaning .
      (42)     (a)   pa r p a r - kwo
                     sharp-like
                     kind of sharp
               (b)   t u k re- 1 i ke
                     short- like
                     kind of short
I t has an important function in a type of comparative predication , discussed
in chapter S .
      ( 43 )         yen-ke reymen wa n - ke - kwo
                     2SG-PS knife l S G-ps- like
                     your knife is like mine
                                                                                   51
Finally , the same suffix productively derives adverbs from nouns ,
demonstratives , and other adverbs .
      (44)   (a)   p i y re n - kwo
                   dog-         like
                   like a dog
             (b)   Po l i w- kwo
                   Po liw- like
                   like Po liw
      (45)   (a)   topo r - kwo
                   that- like
                   thus
             (b)   a d e r - kwo
                   this-like
                   thus
     ( 46)   (a)   ya row-  kwo
                   tomorrow-like
                   around tomorrow
             (b)   tcey- wo
                   near- like
                   sort of near
3 . 8 . 3 The number markers occur on human Common and Proper nouns in the case of
-wcew DUAL and -worn PLURAL and on Place names and most common nouns and
adj ectives in the case of ycen i rn GENERIC . All three of these have the pecu l iar
                                       -
property of deriving a form with some of the morphological character istics of a
personal pronoun from a noun . Both the di stribution of the number markers and
the morphological properties of personal pronouns rece ive fuller discussion in
section 3 . 5 and 3 . 6 . But briefly , where nouns may not take the possessive
suffix - ke , nouns bearing the number markers may . Where a subclass of nouns
may take the locative suffix - a / - ka , nouns with number marking may not . And
where nouns take one of the allomorphs of the object marker beginning with a
consonant , number-marked nouns take the al lomorphs consisting of a vowe l alone .

4. 1   Structure o f the verb compl ex
Many o f the aff ixes discussed in this chapter have already appeared in section
2 . 2 . There I was concerned with the changes phonemes undergo in the presence
of other spec i fied phonemes and boundaries in the verb complex and elsewhere .
Here , I descr ibe the formal morphological simi larities and differences among
verbs , the co-occurrence of affixes , and the meanings and functions of the
affixe s . I llustrative paradigms are to be found at the end of this chapter .
We can begin by examining a few highly expanded forms of typical verbs to
i l lustrate the overall structure of the verb complex and the order of the
elements that it compr ises . For the sake of intel ligibility , I wi l l f irst
display a table o f the slots i n the verb complex and the affixes that may f i l l
them , and then present the evidence for the analys i s . with the exception o f
slot +1 , the l i s t s o f affixes for each slot are exhaustive . I discuss the
aff ixes that occur in slot +1 fully in section 4 . 1 2 .
Co-occurrence restrictions make three examples neces sary to i l lus trate the
relative order of a f f ixes in all slots . I will discuss these in subsequent
section s .

Example ( 4a) provides the single most semantically plaus ible combination of
affixes from the same slot avai lable from the inventory . Neverthe less , it is
entirely unacceptable , the form with this meaning being :
         (4)     (b)    -8 -7 0         +5
                        ka -w- a l ow- re
                        NG-NF-speak-Fu
                        can ' t/won ' t speak
The comb ination of slot -6 aff ixes in example ( 5 ) is again ungrammatical in
spite of its semantic plausibility .
         (5)     -8 -6 -6 0           +5
                 a p - ma -w- a l ow- re

                 *don ' t go and speak while [ someone is ] absent
The semantic bizarreness of other concatenations of affixes from the same slot
makes i llustration of the ir unacceptabil ity virtually unnecessary .
The examples below demonstrate that affixes from the various slots are not
permutable . Each example shows a single permutation of affixe s in an otherwise
wel l- formed and minimal verb complex .
         (6)      - 7 -8 0       +5
               '''d - k a - puya-e
                  FA-NG-hit- P
                *didn ' t hit
Example        ( 6)    shows that affixes from slots -8 and -7 are not permutable .
         (7)      -6 -7 0       +5
               '''ma - d - puya-e
                  MT-FA-hit- P
                *went and hit
Example ( 7 ) demonstrates that aff ixes from slots -7 and -6 are not permutable .
A very large number of additional examples , which I hope the reader is wi l l i ng
to forego , would demonstrate the impermutabil ity of affixes in other slots and
of non-adj acent affixe s .","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"

4 . 9 . 3 Where there is both a subj ect and a comitative , the following pr inciples
determine the number agreement on the verb and the interpretation of the number
of actors .
(1)    Number marking on the verb i s optional i n any comitative construction .
( 2 ) Where the verb i s marked for number , i t may agree either with the actual
number of actors , inctuding both the subj ect and the comitative , or with the NP
whose referent is the more numerous .
( 3 ) I f the subj ect i s not first person dua l , then the sub j ect does not inc lude
the comitative and the number of actors must be interpreted as the total of the
sub j ect plus the number of the comitative .
( 4 ) I f the sub j ect is f irst person dual and the comitative is s ingular , then
number agreement on the verb may disambiguate the number of actors .
       ( a ) I f the verb bears dual marking , then the dual subj ect includes the
       singular comitative .
       (b)  I f the verb is marked with a plural suf fix , then the dual sub j ect
       does not include the s ingular comitative and there i s a total of three
       actors .
       ( c ) I f the verb is unmarked for number , then the sentence w i l l remain
       ambiguous as to whether there are two or three actor s .
( 5 ) I f either the subj ect or the comitative i s plural , then the verb w i l l

These principles account for the fol lowing facts concerning the interaction of
number marking and a comitative construction .
I f both the subj ect and the comitative are dual , then there are four actors and
the verb may be marked as e i ther dual , plura l , or unmarked .

Because they can co-occur in a fixed orde r , I have placed the two ' adverbial '
prefixes t aw- yet , sti l l and owra- again in separate s lot s , -5 and - 4 . Both of
these prefixes are very productive . Frequently owra - occurs attached to the
root � y � come to derive a form meaning return.

The other prefix , taw- , often occurs in Temporal c l auses ( c f . 1 0 . 3 ) . Like
several of the ' compound ' suffixe s , this prefix , along with regular tense and
aspect marking , and the nominal suff ix -wo just which can occur on verb forms
in certain syntactic environments , helps Awtuw to compensate for its lack of
con j unction s . Among them , these strategies can produce a wide range of
temporal c lause types ( cf . 10 . 3 ) .

Awtuw codes gramma tical ly , through verb affixation , a number of concepts that
in other languages might require an additional verb . In particul ar , the suffix
-kayna and go is used to indicate that the subj ect goes away after performing
the action depicted by the verb roo t .
Most of the pref ixe s in the Location/Direct ion s lot - 6 can have much the same
function . Ma- go and spec i fical ly , has virtua lly the opposite affect from
- kayna    the sub j ect move s and then performs the action depicted by the root .
             -
Ma - doe s not specify the d irection of motion , whether it is from a source or
to a goal , or whether it is up or down with relation to s lope or stream .

Slot +1 i s unlike any other s lot in three maj or respects . First , there are at
least 3 0 morphemes , li sted below , that can fill it . Second , as many as three
of the e l i gible morphemes can co-occur in the same verb complex . I have chosen
to place the entire class o f morphemes in the same s lot , rather than three
separate slot s , because any of the e ligible morphemes would be able to occupy
any of the s lot s , as long as no s ingle morpheme occurs more than once . And
final l y , seven of the morphemes are identical or nearly identical in form to a
verb root that occurs independently. I t is for thi s reason that I have
designated the slot a Compound slot. Another factor that has contributed to
this deci sion is the semantic diversity that the morpheme s in this class
d i splay. They range from the Benefactive suffix -kow which increases the
valence of the verb it i s attached to , through the aspectual-l ike I nchoative
suffix - tffiwa , to such apparently lexical and adverbial meanings as - a t a in
order to detain someone .
Every member of this class of morphemes is of a phonological shape plausible
for a verb root , i . e . they end in a consonant or /a/ , and it i s l ike ly that
this construction has ari sen diachronically from a very tightly-bound verb
serialisation . As the seriali sation crystall ised into suffixation , some o f the
verbs which could participate in the seriali sation have ceased to occur as
independent verb s , and a few have not yet done so .
The suffixes that can f i l l this slot may conveniently be divided into semantic
c lasses wh ich I label Grammatical , ' pretend ' Aux i l iary , Aspectual , Quantitative ,
Adverbia l , Consecutive , and Obstructive .
76
I n Table 4 . 7 , I l i st the morphemes that can occur in this position , and have
come to my attention . Each entry includes a gloss for the suffix , and , where
relevant , for the morpheme when it oc curs independently. I have f lagged the
most common morphemes with an asteri sk .","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"

3. 7   Compound i ng
Awtuw has three basic compounding strategies . Two of these compound two nouns
to form a third noun . The other strategy , which compounds two verb roots to
form a verb stem with the same inflectional poss ibilities as a monomorphemic
root , may not be a compounding strategy at all . I have described the re levant
phonemenon in section 4 . 1 2 and 10 . 1 , but feel that it deserves mention in this
section .
                                                                                      47
3 . 7 . 1 There are two strategies for compounding noun s . Because of their
similarity to compounding strategies in Sanskrit , I have used the Sanskrit
names to distinguish them .
First , and least productive among the Awtuw compounding strategies , i s the
Dvandva  compound ( c f . Whitney 1960 : 485-487 ) . This strategy compounds two
common nouns to form a third common noun whose meaning i s a coordination of the
two components . Example ( 3 1 ) i l lu strate s the two most common Dvandva compounds .
      (31)   (a)   neme t+ lJawe r
                   mother+father
                   mother and father� parents
             (b)   r i pye+a 1 me
                   bow+ arrow
                   bow and arrow
3 . 7 . 2 I n the second strategy for compounding two common nouns , the first
mod i f ies or somehow restricts the meaning of the second . Like the Ta tpurusa ,
or ' determinative ' compounds in Sanskrit or C lassical Greek ( c f . Whitney 1 9 60 :
481 , 490-491 , Smyth 1 9 2 0 : 2 52 ) , it may be u se fu l to conceive of the first
component as standing in a dependent , or case , relation with the second .
      (32)   (a)   n i w+ <ewre
                   ground+house
                   house on the ground
             (b)   �p i y�n+ <ewre
                   chicken+house
                   house for chickens
      (33)   (a)   yuwp+ t a pwo
                   kunai+fire
                   fire made of kunai
             (b)   t i y l + yekne
                   s tone+axe
                   axe made of stone
             (c)   emek+    tepe
                   pandanus+sago 'pudding '
                   sago 'pudding ' made with pandanus
The examples in ( 3 3 ) il lustrate situations where the name of a distinctive
material restricts the meaning of a noun that may characteristica l ly denote
something made with other materials .
      (34)   (a)   0 1 e+ yaw
                   bush+pig
                   pig from the bush
             (b)   Wu t l a kw+t a l e
                   Gutaiye+woman
                   woman from Gutaiye
Example ( 3 4 ) i l lu strate s compounds where the first component designates the
source of the second . Example ( 3 5 ) shows a compound where the first component
designates the characteristic inhabitants of the second .
48
     (35)           Qa l e+y i w
                    fish+water
                    waterho le ful l of fish
F ina l ly , the first component noun may denote a whole of which the second forms
a part .
     ( 3 6)   (a)   CI:lW r '+ or
                    house+top
                    roof

                    tree+hair
                    fo liage
              (c)   w i y t a pe+y i 1
                    river+ edge
                    river bcmk
              (d)   r i we+ 1 ake
                    foot+bone
                    bone of the leg
Further discuss ion of compounds l ike the one in ( 3 6a) is to be found in
section 6 . 5 .
As mentioned above , thi s strategy i s quite productive . The resulting compound
nouns bear all the same properties as monomorphemic common nouns , including the
abi l ity to enter into similar compounds .
      (37)    ( a ) [ p i y ren+na l e ]+ l ukw
                      dog+      hole+ middle
                      the middle of a doghole
              (b) [ t aw+ t i w ]+d i yake
                    tree+hair+under
                    the underside of the foliage
3 . 7 . 3 The other strategy compounds two or more verb roots to form another verb
stem which enters into the verb complex as if it were a single root . While any
verb may be the first in such a compound , the second and subsequent roots are
se lected from a clo sed set of about 30 member s . About a third of the members
of this set may themselves function as independent verb roots in meanings
reasonably closely re lated to the meanings they express in a compound . The
balance bear no phono logical resemblance to any independent verb root , although
they al l have a phonologica l shape that would be plausible for one .
The morphemes that may occur as the second and subsequent components of such a
compound range in meaning from �2� give , which marks verbs with a benefactive
argument , through aspectual meanings l ike ! ��� begin and �2 � � � comp le te ly ,
auxi l iary- like meanings l ike (�� � ) e � try , and adverbial meanings l ike � �� !�
secre t ly , to meanings that more closely resemble a second predicate , l ike � ��� �
. . . and g o away .
There is no apparent correlation between the independence of the morpheme and
the independence of its meaning from that of the matrix verb root . Thus , kow
the bene factive marker , which has the most clearly ' grammatical ' meaning of the
                                                                                        49
morphemes in this set , is among the commonest verbs in the language used
independently . But � �Y!:!� . . and go Cf1;)ay , one of the morphemes with the most
                                     .
conspicuously independent meanings , bear s no resemblance to any independent
verb root .
These factors conspire t o make the situation highly ambiguous . The membership
in this class of verb roots that occur independently suggests that the
structure is one of compounding , or of a very tight , partly crystalised , verb
serialisation , or both ( c f . 10 . 1 . 1 ) . But the generally ' grammatica l ' nature of
the meanings expressed suggest an analys i s of the morphemes concerned as verb
affixe s .
I have therefore mentioned the phenomenon here i n the section on compounding
and in the section on verb serialisation ( c f . 10 . 1 . 1 ) , while presenting a full
description , including a complete list of the morphemes in the class , in the
discuss ion of verbal morphosyntax in section 4 . 1 2 .","[52, 53, 54, 55]"

Certain low and mid root vowels raise to become mid and high vowels respectively
when unstressed. It seems obvious that this is a single rule, but there doesn' t
appear to be any convenient way of formalising it. Moreover , it eludes simple
expression because it does not apply to low and mid vowels in all roots, nor
even to all low and mid vowels in the same root. The following examples
illustrate the application of the rule to the vowels of four susceptible roots .

In accordance with the descriptive strategy adopted throughout this grammar,
this section will endeavour to segregate on language-internal morpho syntactic
grounds discrete classes of lexemes in Awtuw, to identify subclasses of the
classes so segregated, and to relate the classes thus isolated to universal
semantic categories.
            The most revealing way to view a part-of-speech system
            is as a few large stem classes . . . divided into
            successively smaller classes on the basis of additional
            criteria. (Hockett 1958 : 2 2 1 - 2 2 8 )
Following Hockett, we can impose a structure on our analysis of the Awtuw
parts-of-speech system by dividing Awtuw lexemes into broad classes and
refining these into more restricted classes corresponding to the parts of
speech in Awtuw.
I refine Hockett ' s method by treating each identifying property as a privative
feature , which can segregate two classes according to the presence or absence
of the feature (Trubetzkoy 1969 : 7 4 ) . The presence of a feature characterises
the marked category.
The structure of a parts-of-speech system thus takes on the shape of a
bifurcating tree each of whose branchings represents the segregation of two
classes based on the specification for a given feature. When no additional
formal properties serve to segregate pairs of categories, the branch terminates
in a named class. In some cases it is possible to name superordinate classes .
Figure 3 . a exemplifies the structure.

To clarify the feature specification, I have included a matrix with each tree.
Once a class had been isolated at any level of structure, specification for
features associated with other classes becomes irrelevant to its classification.
Therefore, not all features used in this analysis cross-classify. For example,
referring to Figure 3.a, the specification of Named Class 3 for feature B is
irrelevant to its classification, and will therefore be enclosed in parentheses
in the associated matrix, Table 3 . a.
                                   Ta bl e 3 . a : ( examp l e )
                         FEATURE      CLASS I                        NC 5
                                   NC 1 NC 2                 NC 3           NC 4
                            A                +                        -
                            B        +            -           (- )          (+)                            C       (-   )       (+)           +             -
          While it is assumed here that the assignment of words to
          parts-of-speech classes is based on properties that are
          grammatical rather than semantic, and often language­
          particular rather than universal, it is also assumed that
          the name that is chosen for a particular parts-of-speech
          class in a language may appropriately reflect universal
          semantic considerations . (Schachter, 1985 : 2 ,
          cf. Lyons 1968:147 , 317-319)
I will therefore refrain from assigning names to the classes isolated in this
analysis until they have been refined sufficiently to suggest a correlation
with a universal semantic type (cf. Dixon 1977 :19-20, 24-30, Lyons ' 1 966: 214) .
The diagnostic properties used to segregate the parts-of-speech classes here
will identify all members of any class , including derived forms. But in
assigning names to classes, it is necessary to identify a focal subclass whose
members are necessarily monomorphemic.

First we can segregate those lexemes that accept the Perfect aspect suffix - kay
from those that do not and denominate the segregated class Class I .
Next, we can divide those lexemes that cannot bear aspect marking into two
additional classes. We call those that can occur as the unique constituent of
a noun phrase Class II �nd the residuum that cannot, Class III .
It may clarify this tripartite division to represent the identifying criteria
by binary features and display the specifications for each class on a matrix.
(Values for features that are irrelevant to the classification are enclosed in
parentheses) .

types (cf. Dixon 1 97 7 : 2 5 - 2 9 ) EVENT and ACTIVITY, which typify the part-of-speech
traditionally labelled Verbs. A few examples will demonstrate the constituency
of the class.

           (b) - r a ren- light up ra r e n - ka y has lit up

           (d) - �� k r a - cook              rok r a - kay has cooked
Aside from the ability to accept Perfect marking, affixation marking Tense,
Modality, and a number of other categories characterises verbs. Chapter 4
provides a detailed discussion of verbal morphosyntax, and Chapter 5 will
present a discussion of the subclassification of Verbs .

Each of the two remaining classes can be subdivided further. Class II lexemes
can again be divided into two classes . One subclass has the property of being
able to occur following t a d e r this to form a single constituent, the other does
not.

3 . 3 . 1 Each of the classes segregated by this criterion is subject to further
division. To begin with, we will examine the distinctions among those lexemes
that do occur in the specified environment.

The lexemes that lack this property, as illustrated in example (3a) , have in
common the semantic property of denoting QUANTITY and I therefore call them
Quantifiers. These lexemes can also refer to a quantity. Chapter 7 on the
structure of the Noun Phrase will discuss other properties of the class of
Quantifiers, including their peculiar ability to function either as a
determiner or a modifier of an NP. Section 11. 3 contains a discussion of
Quantifiers , but I include here a list of the most common.

3 . 3 . 2 The other class, whose members do accept the suffix, as illustrated in
examples (3b-e) can be divided into two further classes. Some of them accept
the Adjective-deriving suffix, - neney , the others do not.

The lexemes that lack this property, as illustrated in examples (4a-b) , share
the semantic property of referring constantly to the same token of a type, or
UNIQUE REFERENCE (Foley 1986 ) . In accordance with tradition I will call these
lexemes Proper Nouns .
30
The other class, whose members accept the suffix as shown in examples (4c-d) ,
share the semantic property of constantly referring to tokens of the same type,
or CONSTANT REFERENCE, and I will accordingly denominate them Common Nouns .
A further feature, the ability to accept the Dual suffix, -wrew , serves to

Example ( 5 ) illustrates the distinction among proper nouns. The proper nouns
that accept the suffix share the semantic property of referring uniquely to a
person, while those that do not refer to places and I accordingly denominate
them Personal Names and Place Names respectively.
Common nouns that accept        share the semantic property of referring to
                                      -wrewrelatives and are called Kinship Terms. Example (6c) shows that the distinction
is not between human and non-human common nouns or between animate and inanimate
common nouns. While in most respects syntactically identical to other common
nouns, it will become apparent in Chapter 7 that kinship terms need to be
distinguished from the other common nouns here. section 3 . 5 presents a
description of the other formal properties of nouns .
Table 3 . 2 displays the feature specifications for each of the subdivisions in
this class and Figure 3 . 2 illustrates the structure of the classification.

those that may not follow tade r this to form a single constituent. These
lexemes share the semantic property of referring to tokens of different types,
or SHIFTING REFERENCE. In accordance with the usual convention, I call them
Pronouns .
Two additional features divide the pronouns into four distinct classes.
Example ( 7 ) shows that some pronouns may agree with a following noun in number,
while others do not.
     (7)    (a) tey t a l e
                 3FS woman
                 the woman
            (b) om t a l e - m
                     r                     3PL woman - PL
                     the women
             (c) tade- t t a l e
                     this-FS woman
                     this woman
             (d) t a d u-m t a l e- m
                     this-PL woman-PL
                     these Women
             (e) mene tey             t a l e ( -m }
                     whatchamacal lit woman-PL
                     what 's her/their name (s ) ?
             (f) ye ran t a l e ( -m }
                     who ? woman-PL
                     what woman/women?
For the nonce we may call the class of pronouns that may agree with a following
noun in number Class A , and the class that does not, Class B .
32
Crosscutting this distinction is the ability of some pronouns to accept the
Locative suffix - kef - e .
     (8)  (a) * rey-ke
                3MS-L
          (b) *ye r a n - ke
               who ?- L
          (c) t a d e r - ke
                this- L
               at this one
          (d) men e rey-       ke
                whatchamaca l li t-L
                at whatchamacal li t
There are thus four classes of pronouns :
(a) Personal Pronouns like rey , which distinguish number but do not take
Locative marking,
(b) Demonstrative Pronouns like tade r , which distinguish number and accept
Locative marking,
(c) Interrogative Pronouns like y e ra n , which neither distinguish number nor
take Locative marking, and
(d) Obliviative Pronouns like mene rey , which do not distinguish number, but
do take Locative marking.
Table 3 . 3 exhibits the feature specifications for the four classes of pronouns .
Other pronominal properties are discussed below in section 3 . 6

We can now rename Class II lexemes, i.e. those that can be the unique
constituent of a Noun Phrase, as Substantives. Figures 3 . 3 displays the
structure of the subcategorisation of the class , and Table 3 . 4 displays their
feature specifications.

3.4   C l a s s i f i cati o n o f non s u b s tanti v e s
The lexemes i n C lass I I I fal l into several subc lasses . F i r s t w e can i solate the
subclass whose members share the property of following a personal pronoun and a
common noun to form a s ingle constituent .

The lexemes that fal l into this c lass belong to the semantic types AGE ,
DIMENS I ON , VALUE , SPEED , PHYS ICAL PROPERTY , and HUMAN PROPENSITY ( c f . Dixon
1 9 7 7 : 3 1 ) . I will again venture to specu late that if a language has a
g rammatically identi fiable class whose membership is typified by the semantic
type s DIMENSI ON and VALUE , then that class may appropriately be denominated
Adj ective s .
A sma l l subclass of Awtuw Adj ectives is identif iable by the abil i ty of its
members to intervene between another adj ective and a common noun to form a
s ingle constituent .
The Intens i f iers , mede and yapo r qui te , very and yankeyke a little may modify
Nouns , other Adj ectives , or certain Adverbs ( cf . 7 . 4 ) .
      ( 11 )   (a)   wa r u ke mede neme t
                     big       very mother
                     a very big mother
               ( b ) '<wa ruke monokene neme t
                       big     bad       mother
                     *a badly ( ? ) big mother
The other Ad j ectives constitute an apparently closed class of about 3 6 member s
which can be categorised according to their semantic type . Note that one of
the D IMENSION ad j ectives is also an intensifier and that two of the AGE
ad j ectives , oWyffin and ow t i ykaYffin o ld also functions as nouns , meaning old man .
The only SPEED adj ective a l so functions as an adverb , a property I suspect of
be ing common for SPEED adjective s . In Engl ish , for example , one SPEED
adj ective,  f a s t , not only functions as an adverb , but may not even accept the
                                                                                            35
productive adverb-deriving suffix - l y . Two other SPEED adjectives , s l ow and
q u i c k , which may accept - l y , regularly function adverbially without it. Those
SPEED adjectives that take - l y obligatorily in adverbial function , like l a ng u i d ,
d i l a t o r y , p r ec i p i t a t e , rap i d , and even sw i f t may more appropriately be
classified as MANNER adjectives. Like q u i c k , kupkwa p , may accept the adverb­
deriving suffix, but also functions adverbially without it.

Colour terms, which are not monomorphemic Adjectives, receive further discussion
in section 1 1 . 2 .
Derived Adjectives with the suffix - n eney , which compensate to a great extent
for the paucity of monomorphemic adjectives, share their properties (cf. 3 . 8 . 1 ).
On the basis of their acceptance of the suffix - kwo/ -wo like, simi lar to, sort
of (cf. 3 . 8 . 2 ) , we can discriminate two further subclasses within Class III .
     ( 1 3 ) (a) ade- kwo
                   here-like
                   around here

                    soon- like
                   *around soon
The subclass that accepts the suffix i s difficu lt to characterise in terms o f
semantic type , but i t does include tokens of TIME and MANNER . S o without
speculating on the univer sality o f the category I w i l l call this class Adverbs .
On semantic grounds , there are three types of Adverbs - Demonstrative Adverbs ,
Interrogative Adverbs , and ' Lexica l ' Adverbs . Table 3 . 6 disp lays a l l the
members of the first and second type s . Further discuss ion of the forms of these
adverbs is to be found in section 3 . 8 . 2 .
with the exception of kupkwap quickly , ' Lexica l ' adverbs a l l denote time or
d i stance and I d i scuss them and l i s t them in ful l in a later section on
Numeration and Measurement i n section 1 1 . 3 . Table 3 . 6 therefore exhibits only
a few examples .","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]"

As is apparent from the data in Table 1 1 . 5 , each of the terms ends in the
productive suffix -wo/- kwo like . All save two , k i ywo- kwo white and kow l aw- kwo
ye l low are transparently derived from other lexeme s .
Berlin and Kay ( 1969) have developed and defended a hypothe sis that the foci
of colour terms do not vary signi ficantly from language to language , and that
languages select the ir basic colour terms from a limited inventory in a
predictable manner .
They de fine the concept o f a basic colour term (p . 6 ) a s a term that is :
(a)    monolexemic - the meaning is not predictable from the meanings of i t s
       components ,
186                                                              of anothe r colour term ,
(bl   autonomous - i t is not inc luded within the meanin g
                                                                  o f entitie s , and
(cl   general ly appl icable - not re stricte d t o a small class
(dl   psycholog ically salient -
      i.      occurs early in e lic itation of colour terms
      i i . has stable reference
      i i i . occurs in all idiolects .
U s ing these criteria , a l l of Awtuw ' s colour terms except k i ywo- kwo white and
kow l aw- kwo ye l low are immediately identif iable as non-ba sic under criter ion ( a l ,
although they do , i n fac t , meet the othe r criteria .
We can identify those two terms as basic colour terms because , although they
bear a productive suffix , or at least something forma lly indistingui shable from
one , the ir meaning is not predictable .
The data on Awtuw colour terminology were elic ited using the same colour chart
that Berlin and Kay used in their study . As they sugge st , there is remarkable
consistency among speakers as to the foci of the various colour terms and an
even more remarkable inconsistency regarding the extensions of the terms .
The foci of Awtuw ' s eight terms are all within the ranges Berlin and Kay
predict on the basis of the sample they examined . But Awtuw appe ars to violate
the ir proposed universal ordering of colour terms .
I f we restrict our attention for the present to the two terms that fit the
definition of basic colour terms most closely , the terms for white and yellow ,
we find that they violate Berlin and Kay ' s first ' distributional restriction ' :
' Al l languages contain terms for black and white . ' (p . 2 l .
Turning to the other colour terms , although they are not basic under Berlin and
Kay ' s de finition , we find that for the most part they conform to Ber l in and                                                                                            [� l

1 1 . 1 . 7 There is a name taboo associated with various af final re lations . The
form this taboo takes is that ego may not pronounce the personal name s of anyone
standing in the appropriate relation to him or her - Awtuw speake rs typically
have from three to six personal name s - eithe r in reference or in addre ss .
All name taboos are reciprocal , whether the terms by which Ego and the specified
affine addre ss each other are reciprocal or not . Thus , Ego and his sister ' s
husband ' s s ister cal l each other a y ra m and may not pronounce each othe r ' s name s .
But although Ego calls h i s wife ' s mother Qamey and she calls him yen a n , they
still may not pronounce each othe r ' s name s . Affines in a name-taboo relationship
addre ss and re fer to each other by the name of the re lation .
Moreover , Ego may not address or refer to any namesake of the relevant affines
by the tabooed name . Generally , anyone who is not in a name-taboo re lation with
Ego wi l l have at least one personal name that does not overlap with the persona l
names of those who are in such a re lation to Ego . Note that the namesake o f
someone i n a name taboo relation with Ego may pronounce Ego ' s name , provided Ego
is not a name sake of someone in a name -taboo relation with that person .
Finally , where an aff ine in a name-taboo re lation to Ego has a personal name
that i s also a common noun or one that resemble s a common noun close ly , Ego may
not use that common noun . Affines in a name-taboo relation to Ego are
represented by filled triangles and circles in Figures 1 1 . 1-7 .
We c an i l lustrate this with reference to the data in Figure 1 1 . 7 .","[188, 189, 190]"

1 0 . 1 . 2 The second strategy involves the seriali sation o f a truncated verb form
with a direction verb . There are two types of truncated verb serialisation .
In the first type the first verb consists of a fu ll set of pre fixe s and any
verb root , but no suff ixation whatsoever . The second verb consists of a full
verb complex whose root must be �y go . Speakers often re iterate the form of
�y a s many as five times or more , but only the last verb bears suffixation .
The semantic function of this strategy i s to depict prolonged continuous or
habitual a spect .

                    what haven ' t you two kep t going and doing to my turtle ?
Nothing may intervene within this type of seriali sation . The single ten se
marker , i f any , has scope over the entire serial i sation , as does any directional
pre fix or root compound , as i llustrated in ( ld ) . Example ( lb ) shows that if
the first verb has the Imperfective prefix , then the final verb must be an
Imperfective form. Simi larly , any Negative prefix must occur on both verbs , as
shown in ( ld ) .
One variation on thi s strategy involves the repetition of full forms of �y
after a truncated verb , with the same semantic function , as shown in examp le
( 2)•

              she twisted [ string ] again and kep t twisting
The second type is formally very similar to the first . But there are three
major difference s . First , i n this strategy only two verbs may enter into the
seriali sation . Second , the first verb must be e ither � � ge t , l � Y bear , �� y
carry , one of the other verbs of carrying , or one o f the manner of motion
verbs , e . g . i my a run , towkaney climb ( c f . 5 . 4 . 2 ) . And third , the second verb
may be any of the Direction verbs .
When the first verb i s �� get , the second verb depicts a sequential action
deriving a form meaning ' take ' or ' br ing ' .

Whe re the first verb is a verb of carrying or a manner of motion verb , the
construction specifies direction and allows an accompanying source or goal NP .

                  they oarried him here
Example ( 5 ) i l lustrates the distinction between a manner of motion verb alone
and such a verb in this construction , where there is a Locative NP in the
clause .
The inte rpretation of the Locative NP as source or goal depends upon the point
of view of the speaker and the class of the directional verb . Thus , the NP in
( 5b ) gets goal interpretation if the narrator adopts the perspective of being
outside the vil lage and source interpretation if the narrator adopts the point
of view of someone within the village ( c f . 5 . 3 . 1 ) .

                  he ran to/from the vi l lage
Simi larly , the Locative NP in ( 6 ) will be a goal i f the speaker adopts inside
perspective , and a source if the narrator views the situation from outside .

verb form , with the same semantic function as the first type of truncated verb
seriali sation - to depict continuous or habitual aspect .

            she kep t on twisting string
This construction ha s a characteristic intonation where each repetition of the
verb is pronounced with a low pitch , and the final syllable of the last
repetition is protracted and has a rising pitch .
                                                                                       155
10 . 1 . 4 The next strategy concatenates between two and five full verb forms .
Nothing may intervene between the verbs in this type of serialisation .
Although each verb is fully inflected , they d o not select categories
independently . Every verb must bear the same tense marking . Typical ly , each
verb will bear the same a spect marking as we l l . But since one or more of the
verbs may be serialisations of a truncated verb with �y , which is itse l f a mark
of a spect , there doe s not appear to be a constraint that a s ingle aspect must
have scope over the entire serialisation .
As nothing may interrupt the serialisation , the same argument or set o f
arguments w i l l apply t o every verb .

               what wou ld they boi l and eat it wi th ?
The intonation characteristic of this serialisation strategy involves a high
p itch on the penultimate syllable of each serialised verb falling over the
ultimate , with no pause between verb s , as shown in example [ 10 ] .               �

A single subject has scope over the entire serialisation , and as in the
preceding strategy , al l the verbs must be marked for the same tense .

There is an intonation character istic o f thi s strategy that c learly
distinguishe s it from the preceding construction on the one hand , and from
other strategies with either a reiterated sub j e c t , a change of sub j e c t , or
a change of tense on the other .
156
In this case , the intonation rises over the penultimate syllable of each verb
in the serialisation , except the last , and remains high over the lengthened
ultimate syllable , fol lowed by a brie f paus e . When the subj ect changes or is
repeate d , the intonation falls from a high pitch ove r the penultimate syllable

1 0 . 1 . 6 The last strategy resembles a participial construction in certain
respects . Although there is no actual participial form in Awtuw , an
Imper fective form unmarked for tense functions like one in this construction .
The situations depicted by the two verbs are interpreted as simultaneous .
The tense of the second verb has scope over the unmarked first verb .
The ability of a subj ect to occur with the second , tense -marke d , verb
distinguishe s this construction from the one described in 10 . 1 . 5 .
The verbs accept independent aspect and directional marking , as shown in
e xample ( 14a) . Examples ( 14b) and ( 1 4c ) il lustrate that Adverbs and Location/
Direction NPs have scope over only one of the verbs .

10 . 2      Nom i n a l con s t ruc t i o n s
There a r e six types of nominal constructions in Awtuw , a l l of wh ich involve a
predication as a constituent of an NP .","[159, 160, 161, 162]"
"
4 . 1 3 . 4 All other roots except those d i scussed below fal l into the same
conjugation c l ass . Such differences as exist among them are accounted for by
the morphophonological rules presented in section 2 . 2 . The paradigms for three
such regular roots appear in Table 4 . 13 at the end of the chapter . Each of the
three , along with r 2� r§ from the first conj ugation c lass , i l lustrates different
morphophonological properties .
The members of thi s , the large s t , and residual , con j ugation class , are again
impossible to characteri se as semantically unified .

detai led classif ication of verb roots on morphosyntactic grounds .",[89]
"
9 . 4 . 2 Awtuw uses four other focusing strategie s , a l l o f them much rarer than
po . The simplest of the se is topicali sation , which entails e xtracting the
focused constituent with a pause between the extracted constituent and the rest
of the clause .
     (42)     (a)   Ta k i y , t a d e r rew re d - u y - kay
                    Takiy this house FA-bui ld-PF
                    Takiy, he 's bui lt this house
The top icalised constituent may appear e i ther to the right or to the le ft of
the clause .
              (b)   t a d e r rew r e d - uy - ka y , Ta k i y
Topicali sations may focus direct obj ects , recipients , instruments , or any other
nominal constituent .
     ( 43 )   (al   yekne- re- k , Ke r i y rev taw d - uwk- 0
                    axe- 0- I Keriy 3MS tree FA-fe l l-p
                    with an axe, Keriy fe l led the tree

              (b)   w a n rew r e d - uy - kow-o , Kampo- re
Note that appositiona l intonation over the extracted constituent and the
associated pause , represented here by a comma , are necessary compone nts of thi s
construction . Without the m , the resulting permutation o f word order would have
no particular focusing e ffect .
150
9 . 4 . 3 Dis location di f fers from topicali sation only in that a pronominal copy
of the focused constituent remains behind in the body of the clause .
      (45)     (a)   Peyaw , rey yaw- re d - i y- e
                     Peyaw 3MS pig-o FA-shoot-p

The dis located element may appear to the right or to the left of the clause
from which it was extracted .
               (b)    rey yaw- re d - i y -e , Peyaw
The dis location strategy may be used to focus any nominal constituent , but not
pronominal , adverbial , or verbal constituents .
      (46)     (a)   rey yaw , A l t i y rey-e d - i y - e

9 . 4 . 4 Awtuw forms clefts by extracting a nominal constituent for focus ing from
a c lause , predicating that constituent to a third-person pronoun agreeing with
it in sex and number , and modi fying it with a restrictive re lative clause
formed from the balance o f the original clause .
      (49)     (a)    A l t i y yaw wa r uke d - i y - e
                      A l tiy pig big        FA-shoo t-p
                      A l tiy shot a big pig
               (b)    rey A l t i y [ yaw wa r u ke d - i y-  e - re ]
                      3MS A l tiy pig big           FA-shoo t-p-o
                      it 's A l tiy who shot a big pig
The clef ted consti tuent may appear to the right or to the left of the re lative
clause .
               ( c ) [ yaw wa r u ke d - i y - e - re ] rey A l t i y
This strategy may also focus any nominal constituent .
      ( 50 )   (a)    re y t a d e r yaw [ Yawman d - i y - e - re ]
                      3MS this pig Yawmen FA-shoot-p-o
                      it 's this pig that Yawmen shot

      (51)     (a)    rey Treyp i 1 [ P i y n a n e d- ey- e - re ]
                      3MS Ta lbipi Piynane FA-come-p-O
                      it 's Ta lbipi that Piynane came from
               (b) [ P i y n a n e d -e y -e - r e ] rey Treyp i l
                                                                                    151
9 . 4 . 5 F inally , Awtuw can focus constituents by p seudoc le fting . In thi s
construction , a nominal constituent is extracted from the clause , a generic
noun is predicated to it, and that noun heads a re lative clause formed from
the rest of the original clause .
     (52)   L i wm i y rev l ape     [ Kewmrey d - cey- ka - re ]
            Lumi       3MS vi l lage Kewmaey FA-go-PF-O
            Lumi is the vi l lage Kewmaey has gone to
Pseudoclefts with the focused constituent to the le ft do not focus sub j ects .
In pseudoclefts to the right , wh ich may focus any nominal constituent , the
focused e lement appears a lone to the right of the clause a fter a pause , while
the inserted head noun remains on the left .

                               I NTERPRED I CATE A N D I NTERC LAUSAL RELAT I ONSAwtuw displays a wide variety of constructions for re lating predicates . The se
range from the strategy described in section 3 . 7 . 3 and 4 . 14 , which fuses roots
within a single verb complex , to strateg ie s that con join clauses with separate
sets of NPs and complete ly independent speci fication for verbal categories .
This chapter describe s the forma l properties of each construction and re lates
them to the ir semantic functions .
The constructions fall into five di stinct categorie s . Serial isation construc­
t ions concatenate verb roots , verb forms , or verb phrases whose subj ects are
obl igatorily co-referential to code diverse semantic functions ranging from an
increase in valency to a sequence of actions .
Nominal constructions subordinate a verb phrase or a full c lause as a
constituent of an NP per forming a nominal or ad j ectival function. In these
constructions , the tense of the subordinate verb is e ither determined by the
construction or interpreted as relative to the tense of the matrix verb .
Nominal constructions code a variety of relations ranging from so-called psych­
action complements , such as ' remembe r to . . . ' , to cause clause s , inc luding
re lative c lause s .
Adverbial constructions code actions contemporaneous or sequential to the
action coded by the matrix verb . They are formally similar to nominal
constructions in some respect s . But where a nominal clause is marked a s
subordinate with the suffix - re , a n adverbial clause bears the suf fix - rek .
Moreover , the subject of an adverbial clause may not occur as the obj e c t o f
the matrix clause , a s is possible in certain nominal constructions . And an
adverbial clause functions adverbial ly rather than nominally or adj ectivally .
Condi tional constructions j uxtapose two interdependent clause s which must bear
identical future or conditional marking .
Co-ordination constructions j uxtapose two or more entirely independent clauses
to code simultaneous , consecutive , and unspecified re lations among predicate s .","[155, 156, 157, 158]"

verb . In fact , the form that I cite as the root , � ���y is probably a
crystalised imperfective stem formed from a root � and the imperfective
circumfix - k - -ey .   If this conj ecture is correct , then the initial vowe l would
have ari sen from an epenthetic vowel regu larly inserted between the factive
prefix d- and the prefix component of the imperfective circumf ix - k - and a
regular w-metathesis rule would have reversed the order of the - k - and the -w- .
The future form , w-owkey - re , which occurs only rare l y , demonstrates that the
form is indeed crystalised because the regular future imperfective of a root �
would have to be * ka -w-ey- re . There wou ld be no factive prefix , the non-factive
prefix w- would be deleted before the - k - , and there would be no epenthetic
vowel before the -k- to accept stress and condition w-metathesi s . The past
tense form , d - awkey- e , i s much more common . The root appears very often in the
Debitive wan-owkey . A l l three of these are formal ly regular for a root �� �� y .
But the root occurs most frequently in a defective imperfective form unmarked

da-w- awkey .","[89, 90, 91]"

Trans itive verbs fall into three main classes according to whether they derive
intransitive verbs or not and whether it is the subj ect or the obj ect of the
trans itive verb that becomes the subj ect of the intransitive verb .
Verb Morphology does not reflect these derivations . It is only through the
argument structure of the pred ications the verb participates in that the
derivation becomes apparent .
Some transitive verbs do not der ive corre sponding intransitive verbs at all .
A deleted subj ect or obj ect can only be interpreted as anaphoric or irre levant .
Because these verbs are always transitive , I call them card inal transit ive
verbs .

Another class derive s intransitive verbs whose subj ect corre sponds to the
direct obj ect of the transitive form . Thi s class of verbs bears a formal
resemblance to the class of English verbs that Lyons ( 1 968 : 3 59-360) calls
' causative ' verbs . I am therefore adopting his term for the corresponding
class of Awtuw verbs .
On the whole , causative verbs do not permit the deletion of the ir object .

The third class of transitive verbs derives an intransitive verb whose subj ect
corresponds to the subj ect of the transitive form . I again follow Lyons ' s
( 1968 : 360- 3 6 1 ) terminology in calling verbs in this class ' object deletion '
verbs .

The VV and unitary vowel analyses would also require a rule to transform high

4.2. 1     The debi ti ve modal i t i e s
Awtuw codes debitive i l locutionary force , i . e . commands , necessiti es , and
strong sugge stions , in a set of pre f ixes that occupy the very first slot in
the verb complex a long with the negative and potential prefixes . It is only
in the debitive modalities that verb affixes are sensi tive to the person of
the subj ect .
( 1 ) The Hortative prefix p ( a ) - occur s only with fi rst person subj ects and is
used in situations where the subj ect wi shes to express a f irm intention to do
something in the immed iate future with an implicit request for the addres see ' s
permiss ion or agreemen t . Semantically , the Awtuw Hortative bears a very c lose
resemblance to Engl ish le t-Hortative s .
                                                                                        55

             Mommy, let me go get that dry coconut !
As these examples i l lustrate , a subj ect pronoun may or may not occur i n
Hortative clauses , the person , and usually the number , o f the subj ect being
recoverable from the verb affixation . A Hortative clause may cons ist of the
verb complex alone or may have any number of arguments and adjuncts . Whi le the
tendency for c lauses to be verb f inal is somewhat stronger for debitive
modal ity clauses , it is not unusual to f ind the verb in other position s .
    ( 11 )   wa n p - a pwo y a k um- kwo wa n k l ow !
             lsg HR-see what- like turtle
             let me see what kind of turtle it is!
Unlike the second- and third-person debitive modalities , the Hortative has no
negative portmanteau counterpart so there is no exact Awtuw equivalent for an
Engl ish le t 's not . . . construction . In such c ircumstances , an Awtuw speaker
would either use a lexical antonym , e . g . let 's go ! for let 's not stay ! , or a
Negative Desiderative , e . g . nom kae-w- i k i y - re re we don ' t want to stay .","[60, 61]"

4 . 1 2 . 2 I have designated the second category of suffixes ' ''pretend'' Aux i l i ary '
because they a l l depict s i tuations that do not come to fruition .
The morpheme -weypa try , or more commonly - p a try , is among the members of thi s
c l a s s that occurs most frequentl y . The f a r rarer - l a i s apparently synonymous .
     (75)      (a)    wan tade r wom-      r e w- oWkaney- ( wey ) pa- re

The third ' pretend ' Aux i l iary suffix is - pa nya pretend, which a lso occurs
independently with the s ame meaning .
    . ( 76 )   ( a)   rev reye rok r a - pa ny- e

4 . 1 2 . 3 The aspectual morphemes - trewa begin and - t ay finish are important in
temporal c lause s .

               lPL food cook- FINISH-PF-just-o 3MS eat-BEGIN-P

The suffix - ney first means just before something e lse , contrasting wi th - preyk
for the first time ever.

The other two Aspectual suff ixes are - i my a quickly , which a l so occurs
independently in the meaning run , and - omku r for a long time , which also
occurs independently in the meaning spend a long time .

4 . 12 . 4Three of the Quant itative suffixes have the property of quantifying any
sub j ect or d i rect obj ec t NP .
The suffix -wo rka can refer to e i ther the subject or the direct obj ec t of the
verb to which it is attached , but does not appear to quant ify indirect obj ects ,
even when there is no overt direct obj ect .
       (81)      ( a)   rom d - ow ra- uk l a - wo rka-m- e
                        3PL FA-AGN- arise-ALL- PL-P

Note that example ( 8 1 a ) a lso i l lu s trates the use of � � ! � , to be d i scussed below
in i t s role as a suff ix , as an independent verb root .
This suffix can also be adverbial , especially with intransitive verb s .
       (82)     w a n w - �y-wo rka- re , ka -w- ew r - eya- re
                lSG NF-go-COMPL-FU NG-NF-AGN-come-FU
                I ' l l go altogether and won ' t come back
One of the four suffixes in this clas s , - t awa incomplete ly , can only quantify
the obj ec t .

The other two , -ok rey a lot , and -wa n a half, may , as I said , quantify e ither
the sub j e c t or the ob j ec t .

4 . 12 . 5
        Two of the suffixes i n the Adverbial c lass have a property similar to
the Quantitative suffixes - they may modify the subject or the obj ect of the
verb . The Engl i sh glosses for example ( 8 5 ) reflect the ambigu i ty of the Awtuw
sentences they gloss .
       (85)     (a)        rom reV        rep i t d a - k - ra- pam ' - ey

                           they are chewing bete lnut and pepper separate ly
Three other suffixes in this class seem to group themse lves together
semantically     - po rya properly , - i yp a p wrong , and -wu l ey badly. Example ( 8 6 )
                       -
i l lustrates the distinction between the second and the third of these .
       (86)     (a)        rev d a - k - rey- i ypa p-ey

                           he 's limping
The first of the three , - po rya , contrasts with both - i ypap and -wu l ey .
       (87)     rev d a - k - rey- po ry ' - ey
                3MS FA- I P-go-PROPERLY - I P
                he ' s walking properly/going the right way
Three other suffixes fall into this class .
       ( 88 )   (a)        rev w- rey- k l a k        - re
                           3MS NF-go-BACK AND FORTH-FU
                           he ' l l go here and there/wa lk back and forth
                (b)        r e v reye r o k ra- twaw- re
                           3 MS food cook- SEE - FU
                           he ' l l cook the food and see how it turns out (i . e . without
                           attachment to result)

                           he cooked food unti l dawn
        The suffixes I am call ing Consecutive a l l depict an action per formed
4 . 12 . 6
after the action depicted by the roo t .
Note that the same subj ect mu s t perform both actions with - uk l a and - ka y n a , but
that with - l a kna , - p r i k , and - newt a , the obj ect of both actions must be the
same .

4 . 13       Conj uga ti on c l a s s e s
Aside from the s ix irregular verbs di scussed i n the next section , all Awtuw
verb roots fall into one of four conj ugation classe s . One of these classes
has five members with slightly aberrant Imperfective suffixe s . The second
class , with 14 members , has a prefix identical in form to the Dual pre f ix
through most of its conj ugation regardless of the number of the subj ect . The
third is somewhat irregular in the way that it accepts the Imperfective prefix .
The fourth class includes all other verb s .

4 . 13 . 1
        The five members of the first class d iffer from other verbs in that the
regular e l i s ion rule does not de lete the f inal lal of the root ( see section 2 . 2 )
after having cond i tioned the lei of the Imperfective suf f ix . Rather , the lei
of the Imperfect ive suffix i s deleted after the f inal la/ . The d i s tinction is
conveniently i l lustrated by contrasting the Imperfective forms · of the
homophonous root s E� consume and ra weave.

1 1 . 1 . 4 There are several intere sting features o f this system . First , and most
conspicuous , is that the term for mothe r ' s brother , waway , is not the same as
that for mother ' s brother ' s son , t amy�n . Second , these two terms alternate in
subsequent generations . Thus mother ' s brothe r ' s son ' s son is again waway , his
son is t amy�n , his son waway again , and so forth .
Next , parents ' mother ' s brother ' s son ' s descendants are all eywe grandparent
regardle s s of generation . Thus , Ego ' s mother ' s mother ' s brother ' s son ' s son ' s
son ' s son , who i s of the same generation as Ego ' s grandchildren , is still
grandparent to Ego . A male ego may marry his eywe , who is the only relative he
may marry . Conversely , a female ego may marry her yenankeyke grandchi ld who is
the only relation she may marry .
Fourth , there are three special terms for affines , to all of whom the name taboo
applies ( c f . 1 1 . 1 . 7 ) and all of which are rec iprocal . T�p i yne is mother ' s
brother ' s daughter ' s husband or wife ' s father ' s sister ' s son . Ayram is Ego ' s
opposite sex s ibling ' s spouse ' s opposite sex sibl ing . And wa l ne is Ego ' s
opposite sex sibling ' S spouse ' s parent or child ' s spouse ' s opposite sex sibling.
Note that these are not the only affines whose name s Ego may not pronounce .
Fifth , Ego ' s parents ' older same sex sibl ings are addressed and referred to by
the same term as grandparents .
Finally , there are two sets of terms for parents ' younger same sex siblings .
Mother ' s younger sister may be e ither �amey mother or ene parent 's younger same
sex sibling while father ' s younger brother may be either �aye father or ene .
In neither system , however , is father ' s brother the same as mothe r ' s brothe r .
Thi s makes classification o f the system i n terms of the first ascending
generation terms problematical . Leaving aside the problem of identifying
parents ' older same sex siblings with parents ' parents , the two co-exi sting
sets of terms for parents ' siblings remain problematical . In one case , the
terms for father and father ' s ( younger ) brother are the same , �aye , and
contrast with the term for mother ' s brothe r , waway - a bi furcate merging
system . In the other , the term for fathe r , �aye , contrasts with both the term
for father ' s ( younger ) brothe r , ene , and that for mother ' s brother - a b ifurcate
collateral system ( Lowie 1968) . Either of these cl assif ications ignores two
apparently signi ficant facts - the problem of parents ' older same sex siblings
remains , and , in the second system , the term for fathe r ' s younger brother
identifies him with mother ' s younger sister .
There is less di ff iculty in classifying the Awtuw system according to cousin
terms ( Murdock 1949 : 2 2 3 ) . This system i s unambiguously an Iroquo is type . The
terms for paral lel cousins identify them with s iblings and contrast with the
te rms for cross cousins . Father ' s older brother ' s son , mother ' s older siste r ' s
son , and (male ) Ego ' s o lder brother are all yaye , father ' s younger brother ' s
son , mother ' s younger sister ' s son and Ego ' s younger brother are all l am , wh i le
mother ' s brother ' s son and father ' s sister ' s son are both tamy�n .","[183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188]"

The pre sence of terms from the last slot on the hierarchy would constitute a
serious violation if it did not have such terms . But there is one additional
violation - Berlin and Kay predict that a language with a seventh term will
have a term for ' brown ' and that languages with any of ' purple ' , ' pink ' ,
' orange ' , or ' grey ' will add those terms after ' brown ' . Awtuw ' s violation ,
whose import is in some que s tion because the terms involved are polymorphemic ,
is in having terms from the last category wi thout having a term for ' brown ' .
The terms �yp i ykwo red and nene l wo green are used by Awtuw spe ake rs in
referring to the brown segment of the colour chart . Figure 1 1 . 9 exhibits the
foci of Awtuw ' s e ight colour terms on a representation of Berlin and Kay ' s
colour chart . The strip at the left cons ist o f a range of greys without hue .
The colours on the body of the chart range from red on the left to purple on
the right and from light at the top to dark at the bottom . All Awtuw speakers
consulted unhe sitatingly selected the border of the chart , which is whiter
than any of the individual chips on the body of the chart proper , as the focus

Awtuw has four basic counting numerals . The se combine produc tive ly with y i y l e
hand, r i we foot , and rame man to form numerals a s high a s 4 19 . But in practice ,
Awtuw speakers se ldom use vernacular numerals in excess of 20 .
There are several reasons for this . First , for most purposes , Awtuw speake rs do
not concern themse lves with precision of numeration          l i wke a lot and y a n ke y ke
                                                                                         -
a litt le, few are ordinarily suf ficiently accurate .       Second , in counting cash ,
Awtuw speakers and the ir ne ighbours use a variety of denominations obviating
the need for large numerals ( see be low 1 1 . 3 . 3 ) . And fina l ly , all Awtuw
speakers are fluent in Tok Pisin and use Tok Pisin numerals freely in all
contexts .

1 . 2 . 3 Most reports of patrols through the area prior to World War II were
destroyed in air attacks on the administrative centre of Aitape . Some of those
that survive indicate that patrols were conducted near , but probably not
through , the Awtuw-speaking region in the early- to mid-1930s ( McCarthy 193 1 ,
1936- 3 7 , Robinson 1931-34 , c f . Marshal l 1 9 3 7 , 1 9 3 8 ) .
Prior to contact and the establishment of government control over the area ,
there was sporadic fighting among the villages in the area . The most recent
series of conf l i cts , which ended in a permanent armistice around 1950 , involved
the vil lages of Kamlakw and Wiyup on the one side , and Nalpetlape ( Taute) and
Wilkilape (Wi lki l i ) on the othe r .
B y the t ime of World War II , Awtuw speakers were regularly contracting t o do
plantation labour and some served in the armed forces during the war . The
Japanese crossed the Torricellis in the course of the invasion and were
certainly in the village of Se inim, but apparently fai led to penetrate as far
south as Kamlakwlape or Wutlakwlape .
In 1948 , the Franciscan order established their mission at Lumi , the nearest
airstrip to the Awtuw-speaking area , about three and a half hours ' walk north­
east of Kamlakwlape . The government established a patrol post there the
fo llowing year and the Christian Missions in Many Lands ( CMML ) , a Brethren
mission , also set up their mission at Lumi in 1949 . The two missions competed
with each other for the souls of the people in the surrounding area , but
eventually divided the area to their mutual satisfact ion . Don and Ai leen
MacGregor , a CMML couple from New Zealand , staffed the Lumi mission , probably
from its inception , unt i l Don ' s death in 1976 . During this time , Don wrote a
number of papers on the culture of the Wapei people ( MaCGregor 1969 , 1972 ,
1974a , 1974b, 1 9 7 5 ) , and , in collaboration with Ai leen , a sketch of 010 grammar
and a glossary of 010 , a Torricelli Phylum language ( MacGregor and MacGregor
198 2 ) .
In 195 7 , Ken Knight , of the Sola Fide Mission , established himself and his
party of seven to nine people in what is now Me leylape . The hamlet was
inhabited at the time , but since the Knights wanted to bui ld their compound
there , the Meley people moved to a nearby spot on the track to Wutlakw . The
Knights compensated the people thus displaced with a payment of one pound .
The Knights ran a school and a clinic at Meley and left in 1961 for reasons
which I have not been able to determine . The Sola Fide Mission sti ll exists ,
with headquarters in Goroka EHP .
After the Knights ' party left , the CMML took over responsibility for Kamlakw
and the surrounding area . Don MacGregor visited frequently to conduct services .
In the mid- 1960s , the CMML sent a school teacher to Kamlakw , but the hamlet
decided to expel him after a year because they considered him excessively cruel
to the chi ldren .
6
Since then , the CMML has sponsored several Awtuw-speaking men to attend their
Bible school at Amanab , and several others have attended Bible classes in Lumi .
B i l l Mitchell , an American anthropologist , spent 18 months in 1970-71 in Taute
doing fieldwork . His wife and two young chi ldren accompanied him on his field­
trip and so the party had a significant impact on the people of the area . A
number of articles and a monograph about Mitchel l ' s f ield experiences have
resulted from this fieldwork . They provide some background on the Wapei
culture , which the Awtuw-speaking people participate in ( see Mitchel l 1 9 7 3 ,
1974 , 1 97 5 , 1977 , 1978a , 1978b , 1978c ) .
Dave Scorza , of the Summer Institute of Lingu istics (PNG Branch) , has been
working in the vil lage of Tumenton i k , about 24 km due east of Kamnum , since
1 968 . He has published some material on the Au language , which , while unrelated
to Awtuw , borders on it ( see Scorza 1 97 2 , 1974) . Awtuw speakers marry into at
least two Au-speaking vil lages ( see Map 1 ) .","[11, 12]"

1 1 . 1 . 8 In addition to other kin relations , two agemates of the same sex may
enter into one of two special fictive kin relations voluntarily . The se are
called ma rap and m i l wane and pairs of agemates who have e lected to enter into
such a relation address and re fer to each other by the name of the re lation .
To enter into a m i l wane relation , the agemates involved wi l l share a g a l i p nut

10. 2 . 2    Fu ture compl ement c o n s truc t i o n s
The first three constructions we w i l l b e examining require a verb with future
marking in the nominal clause . These constructions express desire or lack o f
de sire t o d o something , remembering or forgetting to do something , asking o r
tell ing someone t o d o some thing , and purpose . I n each case , the future -marked
verb depicts an action that must take place after the situation depicted by the
matrix verb . This make s the future marking seem semantically natural .
1 . In one o f the se , the covert subj ect o f the nominal clause must be
co-re ferential with the subj ect of the matrix c lause . Although Awtuw lacks an
infinitive form , this bears a close resemblance to an infinitive construction .
In thi s construction , the future verb functions as the complement o f the othe r
verb , as s ignalled by the Obj ect suffix. The Obj e ct-marked verb may have an
obj ect of its own , but it has no overt subj ect as it is neces sarily
co-re ferential with the subj ect of the other verb.
There is a l imited class of roots that can occur as the matrix verb in this
construction , speci fically , a subset of the cognition verbs . This class
include s the two preference verbs , rewrey l � � like and ���� don ' t like, don ' t
want when they mean like/want to and not like/want to .
        ( 15 )   Ka3mp i y l a pe-  ke w- i k i y - re - re d e - yaw ' - 0                 Kaempiy vi l lage- L NF-s tay-F- 0 FA-not want-p
                 Xaempiy doesn ' t want/like to stay in the vi l lage
The two memory verbs mane � r �� � (ear) forget and nenren -e �� � (hold in thought )
remember enter into this construction when they mean remember/forget to.
        ( 16 )   (a)   wan reye    r a - re- re mane d - a rney- kay
                       l SG food eat-FU-O ear FA-forget-PF
                       I ' ve forgotten to eat
158
      ( 16 )   (b)    wan ma n e d - a r ney- kay reye r a - re ( - re )
                      lSG ear FA-forge t-PF food eat-FU- 0
                      I ' ve forgotten to eat
Awtuw uses the same construction to express purpose when the embedded subject
is co-referential with the matrix sub j e c t . I n this construction the matrix
verb may be any root and the embedded verb bears future marking and the obj ect
suffix .
      ( 17)    A l t i y Kuk rown - t a k i l w - a l ow- kow- re- r e Wu t l a kw-o d - rey - e
               A ltiy Kukrown-o speech NF-speak-BEN-Fu-o Gutaiye -L FA-go-P
               A ltiy went to Gutaiye to speak to Kukrown
A variant of this construction al lows ffiWrey l � Y like, want to take an obj ect­
marked future complement whose subject is a possessive NP co-referential with
the matrix subject .
      ( 18 )   R uwmay rey - rey - ke w- rey - re - re ffiWrey l ay - ka y
               Ruwmay 3MS- 3MS-PS NF-go-FU-O U �                      W
               Ruwmay likes to go
2 . In the second construction , the covert subj ect of the obj ect-marked future
verb is obligatorily co-referential with the indirect obj e ct of the matrix verb .
Again , only a limited class of predicates may take this construction . This
class inc ludes the two speech verbs Y� � �� ask and �� � te l l when they mean ask
to and te l l to.
      ( 19 )   (a)    Yawu r rey-e L i wm i y - e w- rey- re - re da-ma k ' -e
                      Yawur 3MS-O Lumi- L NF-gO-FU-O FA-te ll-p
                      Yawur told him to go to Lumi
               (b)    Yaw u r r ey - e da-ma k ' - e L i wm i y-e w- rey - re ( - re )
                      Yawur 3MS-O FA-te l l- p Lumi- L NF-go-FU- 0
                      Yawur to ld him to go to Lumi
Note that the indirect obj ect of the matrix clause can not intervene be tween
L i wm i ye and w�y r e re .
      [ 19 J *Yaw u r L i wm i y - e rey-e w- rey - re- re d -mak ' -e
              Yawur Lumi- L 3MS-O NF-go-FU-O FA-te l l-p
              Yawur told him to go to Lumi
The preference verbs can also participate in this construction .
      (20)     Awt i y N umoy - re rewrey l ay - k a y L i wm i y-e w- rey- re - re
               Awtiy Numoy-o want bear-PF Lumi- L NF-gO- FU-O
               Awtiy wants Numoy to go to Lumi
3 . Fina l ly , purpose clause s , like the purpose structures described above ,
a lways have a verb in the future . In this construction , however , there are
no co-re ference restrictions .
      (21)     wa n Ma l a y manman ka- r e- re yen-e y uk uwt da- kow- kay
               lSG Ma lay fun       get-Fu-o 2SG-O paper FA-give-PF
               I have given you paper for Ma lay to p lay with
The subj ect of such a purpose clause may bear possess ive marking .
      (22)     wan Ma l ay rey - ke manman ka- r e - re yen - e y u k uw t da- kow- 0
               lSG Ma lay 3MS-P S fun      get-Fu-o 2SG-O paper FA-give-p

                                                                                            159
10 . 2 . 3   Imperfec t i ve c ompl ement constructi o n s
Two types o f complements require a n imperfective form . In one case , the
imperfective verb depicts a skil l that is known , not known , or taught . In the
other , it depicts a situation that i s perceived directly while it i s going on .
The imperfective form i s semantically we ll-suited to such imperfective
situations .
1 . The first type al lows the two knowledge quasi-verbs neknek know and a re n e
                                                           ------
don ' t know to occur in the meaning (no t ) know how to .
        (23)     (a)    A l t i y - wo take   da-k- r ' -   ey- re neknek
                        A l tiy-only bow stop FA- I P-plait-IP-O know
                        only A ltiy knows how to p lait bow s tops
                 (b)    A l t i y-wo neknek t a ke   da-k- r ' -     ey { - re }
                        A l tiy-only know   bow stop FA- IP-p lai t- IP- 0
                        only A ltiy knows how to p lait bow stops
The verb l�mgl�� teach, show also takes this construction .
        (24)     Kukrown wa n - e y i l mre t d a - k- n a k - ey - re d - i yma l ey - e
                 Kukrown lSG-O string FA- IP-ho ld- IP-o FA-teach- P
                 Kukrown taught me to make string figures
2 . Direct perception complements have the ir verbs in the imper fective with
obj ect marking and thei r covert subj ects are co-referential with the matrix
direct obj ect . The perception verbs that take such complements are wan hear ,
gYQ� sme l l , and 2� e � see.        (25)     wan N u moy - re mye d a - k - rok r a - y - re d - ayn ' - e
                 lSG Numoy-o food FA- IP-cook- IP-O FA-sme l l-p
                 I sme l led Numoy cooking food
It is not pos sible for the matrix obj ect to re fer to the obj ect of the embedded
verb in this construction . Example ( 2 6a) , while grammatical , exemplifies not a
direct perception complement , but a relative c lause . Note that it is pos s ible
to insert a perfect verb form , which is not a feature o f this construction , in
( 26b) . Example ( 26c ) shows that an unambiguous relative clause construction is
synonymous with ( 26a) .
        ( 26 )   (a)    wan mye- r e N umoy d a - k - rok r a - y - r e d - a y n ' - e
                        lSG food- o Numoy FA- IP-cook- IP-O FA-sme l l-p
                        I sme lled the food that Numoy was cooking
                 (b)    wan reye - re N umoy rok ra- kay- re d - ayn ' - e
                        lSG food-o Numoy cook- PF- 0 FA-sme Z l-p
                        I sme Z led the food that Numoy had cooked
                 (c)    wan Numoy d a - k - rok r a - y - re mye - re d- a y n ' - e
                        l S G Numoy FA- IP-cook- I P-O food-o FA-sme l l-p
                        I sme l led the food that Numoy was cooking
When the complement subject is overt , it occurs as a pos sess ive pronoun
co-re ferential with the matrix direct obj ect .
        (27)     Os i y Tak i y- re d - uwp - o r e y - ke mye d a - k - rok r a - y - re
                 Osiy Takiy-o FA-see-p 3MS-PS food FA- IP-cook- IP-O
                 Osiy saw Takiy cooking food
160
Perception verbs can also take direct perception complements whose subject is
marked as posses sive . In this case , the complement itse l f serves a s the unique
direct object of the matrix clause .
        ( 28 )    (a)   Os i y Tak i y rey-ke ffiye d a - k - r o k r a - y - r e d - uwp - o
                        Osiy Takiy 3MS-PS food FA- IP-cook- I P - O FA-see-P
                        Osiy saw Takiy 's cooking food
                  (b)   O s i y T a k i y d- uwp -o r ey - ke ffiye d a - k - r o k ra - y ( - re )
                        Osiy Takiy FA-see-p 3MS-PS food FA-IP-cook- IP-O
                        Osiy saw Takiy 's cooking food
10. 2 . 4    Subj ect c ompl emen ts
Sub j ect complements , which are unusual in Awtuw , and whose predicate may only
be a predicate NP or adj ective phrase , also have an impe rfective verb form that
may be marked with - re o
A nominal construction with an imperfective verb form may function a s the
subj ect of certain types of verble ss predication . This construction occurs
very infrequently .
        ( 29)     (a)   Poy t i n a n ta n te �ow d i - k - ye l -e y ( - re ) monokene vapor
                        Poytin a lways tear FA- IP-cry- IP- 0                  bad      very
                        it 's very bad that Poy tin a UJays cries
                  (b)   ffiy      d a - k - r a - y ( - re ) wan - ke l a ke
                        bete lnut FA- IP-eat- IP-O           lSG-PS bone
                        chewing bete lnut is my thing
It is surpri sing that the only available strategy for forming subj ect
complements can accept obj ect marking . It would appear that - re has become
partly general ised as a marker of subordination and that on those rare
occasions when called upon to produce a sub j ect complement , Awtuw speake rs are
therefore inclined to mark the clause with the subordination marker .","[163, 164, 165, 166]"
"
7 . 6 . 1 Where an NP enters into a construction of thi s sort , it most frequently
serialises a nominal constituent cons isting of a noun and an adjective .

The Determiner in this NP prevents any ambiguity from ari sing with regard to
co-re ferentiality . I f the three NPs were not co-referential , the most idiomatic
construction would concatenate equative predications ( c f . 8 . 4 ) , as in ( 4 4b) .
     (44)     ( b ) ( u r u n k rame ) , dam i rame t u k r e rame , dcen i rame . .                         .

                    (three men) , one man is short, one man is . . .

a numeral .

7 . 7 . 2 There are two peculiar constructions that bear discussion in this
context. Both have low functional loads and are probably arcane literary
device s . I n one case , two ful l NPs i n a co-ordinate construction take a single
case marker on the end of the second , as in example ( 56 ) .
      ( 56 )   Wa ypaw i y d - i w rek-e Qaye Ta k i y eywe W i l t i w- re new naw- 0

               Waypawiy begot [ my ] father, Takiy and his e lder brother, Wi ltiw
In the othe r , we f ind two NPs co-ordinated , with separate case marking on each ,
where the semantic re lation between them is posses sive , as in examples ( 5 7 ) and
(58) .
       ( 5 7 ) t a pwo- re uyk- re rey d- ayn- e
               fire- 0 odour-o 3MS RL-sme l l-p

               tooth- 0 mouth- 0 IMP- look-PL
               examine the teeth and mouth
A more idiomatic way of expressing ( 5 7 ) would involve an overtly possessive
construction , as in ( 59a) , or a t a tpuru�a compound ( c f . 3 . 7 . 1 ) , as in ( 59b) .

done elsewhe re , we can segregate verble ss predications into type s .
Several of the distinctions I make in this classi fication rely heavily on the
analys is of the structure of the Noun Phrase which I have presented in de tai l
i n Chapter 7 .","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141]"
"( 2 ) Imperative s are marked by the prefix k a n - and its many al lomorphs , whose
distribution is described in section 2 . 2 . As with Hortative s , the person of an
Imperative verb is always recoverable , and the second person pronoun may or may
not occur .

Althou gh it is uncommon for verbs in the other debitive moda lities to enter
into seriali sations ( c f . 1 0 . 1 . 2 ) , Imperative verbs o ften do so .

( 3 ) Prohibitives with the pre f ix a p-/�p- are the negative counterpart of
imperative s and , l ike imperatives , always have second-person subj ects . Clauses
with Prohibitive verbs share most of the prope rties of other debitive clauses ,
but are even more likely to be verb f inal .

2.2   Mo rphophono l o gy
This section presents a number of ordered rules which together produce most o f
the phonetic forms of Awtuw words from strings of morphemes .
On the whole , the rules apply to verb forms , but where other types of words
meet the environmental criteri a , these rules affect them as wel l . The only
cases o f such rules are one of the vowel harmony rules ( 2 . 2 . 10) , which changes
the canonical lei of the past , future , and obj ect suf f ixes to lrJ or [�J, and
the pre-rhotic stop insertion rule in 2 . 2 . 18 .
                                                                                               17
The rules are ordered and must apply sequentially . This i s particularly
important in the case of the vowel harmony ru les that affect the qual ity of the
Imperfective and Past suffixes ( 2 . 2 . 7 and 2 . 2 . 1 0) . Although nearly identical
in form, one must apply before , and the other after , the e l i sion rule ( 2 . 2 . 9 ) .
with the exception of the vowel gradation rule ( 2 . 2 . 2 0 ) , I have used the
traditional forma l i sms of Generative Phonology to capture the rules conc i sely .
But as I mentioned in Sect ion 1 . 1 . 4 , I do not mean to imply any credence in the
claims of the theory . The formalism mere ly represents a convention to
schematise morphophonological rule s .
Among the formal i sms I have adopted is the labe lled angle bracket notation
(Chomsky and Halle 1 968 : 394-395) . This convention , suggested to me by Avery
Andrews , permits parts of the environment for a rule to be keyed to the
presence or absence of a feature . The benefit of this forma l i sm is that a
single process with a complex environment can be represented as a single ru le ,
in conformity with the intuitive j udgement that the process is unitary in spite
of the complexity of its environment .
Features enclosed in label l ed angle brackets are interpreted as relevant parts
of the environment if the label is [+J, and are ignored when the label is [-J.
Greek letter values are multiplied by any operator on them . Thus , an angle
bracket labe l led [aJ has the same value as some f eature specified [aJ. But an
angle bracket label led [-aJ has the oppos i te value from the f eature spec ified
as [aJ. In example ( 2a ) , the feature F2 is a re levant part of the environment
when Fl is spec ified as [ + J , and irre levant when Fl is speci f ied as [-J. In
example ( 2b) , F2 is relevant when Fl is [-J, and irrelevant when Fl is [+J .
         (2)     (a)     [aFIJ
                         <ex[ +F2 J>
                 (b)     [aFIJ
                         <-ex[ +F2 J>
Thus , the environment in ( 2a) wi l l be read as either [ -FI J , or [ +F l , +F 2 J , and
( 2b) will be read as e ither [ +FI J , or [ -Fl , +F2 J .
I present each rule in a separate subsection , so references to , e . g . Rule 3 ,
refer to the rule presented i n subsection 2 . 2 . 3 . Note that this type of
analysis produces intermediate forms that are neither phonemic nor phonetic
( c f . Chomsky and Halle 1968 : 65 ) . I enclose all non-phonemic forms in square
brackets ([ . . . J) .

The first rule deletes / k / after a consonant and a morpheme boundary and before
another /k/ and a word boundary . Thi s transforms the conditional suffix / k k /
into / k / after a consonant-f inal stem when there is n o desiderative suffix .

The rule also deletes / k / after any unstressed vowe l , any consonant , and a
morpheme boundary and before another / k/ , which s implifies the conditional
suffix after a k - final stem.
