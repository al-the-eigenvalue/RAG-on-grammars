"     It is possible to add the Emph particle yaa to such an answer, hence ay goo yaa
'Yes I will.'
     The one case where such a truncated answer is not possible is a positive answer to
a perfective aspect question, since here the MAN slot is vacant, both positive polarity
and perfective aspect being unmarked. In this case, the only possibility is rjga! 'yes!'.
     It follows that kalaa!, the corresponding 'no!' interjection, is not obligatory as an
answer to any yes-no question, and is not particularly common in this function.
However, kalaa! can also be used to contradict or challenge an assertion by an
interlocutor.
     In (293a), note that Impf goo and its negation sii have their full forms, in contrast
to ο - go and si when followed by an overt VP. These same full forms are also used as
locational quasi-verbs meaning 'be (present)' and 'not be (present), be absent' (§7.1.2).",[192]
"     Although wala logically connects two disjunct clauses, in (292) it functions
indirectly as a kind of polar interrogative marker. German .... oder? '..., or?' following
an affirmative sentence has a similar polar interrogative function.
176 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization     The morpheme rjga! can be used in isolation to mean 'yes!'. Note that rjga
elsewhere functions as the 3SgF pronoun, and as the SFoc (subject-focus) morpheme,
but the etymological connection of the 'yes!' interjection to these grammatical
morphemes is unclear. The form kalaa! means 'no!', again as an isolation form.
     However, rjga! and kalaa! are not the preferred responses to polar questions.
Instead, wherever possible, the response to a yes-no question is a truncated echo clause
consisting of a pronominal subject and a nonzero MAN morpheme, the remainder of
the clause being omitted. (293a) shows positive and negative responses to a question
in imperfective aspect, while (293b) shows a negative reply to a question in the
unmarked perfective aspect.(293)    a.   Q: no-o              dira        suba         wala ?

8.2 Questions and answers8.2.1 Polar (yes-no) questions and answersKCh has no reliable polar interrogative morpheme. The usual simple polar question
has the form of an assertion, usually with rising terminal intonation (290a). Some
younger speakers use clause-initial eska (Fr est-ce que ...?), which is widespread in
                                                      8.2 Questions and answers           175Malian languages. A morpheme kona (variants koni, kooni) is attested as an apparent
clause-initial polar interrogative marker (290b), but it is very rare in my data and is
probably a dialectal borrowing from Fulfulde.(290)    a.   [saa      di]    jiiroo       wor      o        tammahaa
              [time     Def] this-year      2P1S     Impf     hope

              well,         yes-no? 2P1S           Neg get-wet
              'Well, didn't you(Pl) get wet?'","[190, 191]"
"      Disjunctive yes-no questions with wala Or' often take unreduced form, ba occurs
after the first of the disjunct clauses (758a). (758b) shows wala as a tag question in
yes-no contexts where the second disjunct clause (the positive-negative inverse of the
first clause) is omitted.(758)    a.   woo di na mor-ciino woo di^ ο                gay           ba ?
              Dem Def with now            Dem Def Impf be-long-time yes-no?
              wala woo di na            moreyda a          si        gay ?
              or     Dem Def with now              3SgS ImpfNeg be-long-time?
              'From that (prosperous time) to now, has that been a long time? Or from
               that time to now, it has not been a long time?
         b.   wor       kaa-na         huriya    kayna wala ?
              2P1S      come-with knife          small or?
              'You brought the little knife, didn't you?' (='Did you bring the little
               knife?')     Clause-initial particle yala ~ yara is occasionally used instead of wala in simple
or embedded yes-no questions. While wala also means Or' and is basically a
disjunction, yala - yara elsewhere has modal values ranging from desiderative (§9.6.4)
to expectation, cf. (819) in §9.6.5, below.
     Truncated echoic replies to yes-no interrogatives, of the form subject pronoun
plus positive go or negative si, occur in DjCh but less systematically than in KCh.
Alternatives are a simple 'yes!' ( h ! with rising pitch on the second syllable) or 'no!'
(δ'δ! with falling pitch) interjection, or a syntactically complete sentence including a
verb, as in (759).",[421]
"
8.2.7 Tag questions     The tag question is n bey ?, literally 'did you(Sg) know?' can be used regardless
of the form of the preceding assertion. It does not seem to be very common, at least in
Timbuktu. The yes-no interrogative wala can be used after (as well as at the beginning
186 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativizationof) an assertion used as a yes-no interrogative (§8.2.1), so a special tag question is not
desperately needed.","[201, 202]"

"     The composite construction X ci Υ nono occurs chiefly in the negative form X na
ci Υ nono, which functions as the usual negative counterpart of Υ nono, with the
emphasis on identification rather than description. Although the relevant part of (231)
is positive, it is in a yes-no question, which may have favored the longer construction.
A typical negative example is (232).

"
8.2.5 Questions embedded under matrix verbs ('know', 'ask', etc.)Interrogatives are often embedded under verbs of uncertainty. 'Wonder, be curious',
'find out', and 'inquire' are the most obvious, but 'know' and 'see* may also take
interrogative complements (Ί don't know who hit me,' Ί want to see whether he
comes').
     Embedded polar (yes-no) questions can be glossed with 'whether'. The
construction is basically a disjunction (Ί don't know whether he hit me' can be
expanded as Ί don't know whether he hit me, or he didn't me'). In KCh, wala is used
before each such embedded clause, in both monoclausal and biclausal cases. For
examples and discussion see §9.5.4.
     We now consider what happens to the WH-interrogative forms (§8.2.2). The
general principle is that the WH-interrogative stem or phrase is replaced by a non-
interrogative generic NP (normally indefinite in form) which functions as direct object
or other complement of the higher verb. The remainder of the WH-interrogative clause
184     8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativizationsurfaces in the form of a relative clause with the generic NP as head. For example,
embedded 'who?' and 'what?' are replaced by '(a) person who ...' and '(a) thing which
...', asin(311).(311)     a.   ay       si           bey      [bor       kaa      koy]

"    The combination rjga plus Impf ο is transcribed gga^ ο but pronounced [rjgo:]. It is
homophonous with rjgu^ o, consisting of Logo/3ReflSg pronoun plus Impf.
    SFoc gga always appears in the seam between an overt subject NP (which may be
a pronoun) and an immediately following overt core sentence. This is the same pattern
we saw in the preceding section with Foe na. Therefore ijga is not present in truncated
(echoic) answers, consisting of just the focalized subject NP, to WH ('who?', 'what?')
questions (286).",[189]
"
8.1 Focus constructionsMany sentences have no special focus marking. There are, however, productive devices
for marking a particular non-verb constituent (pronoun, full NP, PP, lexical adverbial)
as grammatical ""focus."" The semantic-pragmatic point of marking a focus is to
highlight it as a choice made among two or more logically possible options. The
focused constituent therefore bears the most contestable, unexpected, or novel
information. WH-questions, and answers to them, are the prototypical examples.
     Syntactically, the focused constituent is fronted to the left of the obligatory core
of the sentence (subject NP, MAN morphemes, verb). In most cases a focus
morpheme [SFoc or Foe] is inserted between the focused constituent and the core of
the sentence. Nonsubject and subject focus constructions must be distinguished.",[182]
"(273)         Q: mey    na      a                kar    t ?
                 who?   Foe 3SgS                 hit    i?
                 'Whomx did she hit tx ?'
              A: ay
                 'Me.'     #ay na with Foe na would be ungrammatical. (A morphemically distinct ay na
'no I didn't' with Neg na functions as an echoic answer to a yes-no question, §8.2.1).
     On the other hand, if na were a complementizer bracketed with the core clause
following the focalized constituent, we might expect na to be repeated in a second core
clause attached to the same fronted focus. However, this putative construction, of the
type #[Millet pudding [na we bought] (and) [na we ate]], did not occur in texts and was
rejected by informants. Instead, we get a single na directly following the focused
constituent, before the two parallel core clauses, as in (274). This casts doubt on the
complementizer analysis of na.(274)         häysi     di      na     [ay       kar     i]    [ay       wii      t]
              dog       Def    Foe [ISgS hit             t ] [ISgS kill           t]
              'It was the dogx [focus] that I struck tx .and (that) I killed tx.'",[185]
"     In the case of simple polar questions, there is a logical choice between a proposed
assertion and its negation. 'Did the blacksmith go to the market?' asks the addressee to
choose between 'The blacksmith went to the market' and ""The blacksmith did not go
to the market.' The full logical form of the question is therefore something like 'Is
""the blacksmith went to the market"" true, or is ""the blacksmith did not go to the
market"" true?' In KCh, even though the second disjunct is normally omitted, the Or*
conjunction wala is frequently added to the first proposition (292).(292)    a.   ciimi        daa       nono  wala ?
              truth        Emph it-is      or ?
              'It's quite true, or?'
         b.   bor       mey a           ra   hay a kaa n        har wala ?
              person have 3Sg Loc thing Rel 2SgS say or ?
              One(=you) has something that you have said in (=about) it, or?'",[191]
"    Similarly, marje ~ merje 'how much? how many?' is replaced by an NP
involving generic hinne 'amount, extent, quantity', either as head of a relative clause,
or m situ as in (313).(313)          saa     di kaa rjgu          guna
               time Def Rel LogoSgS see

               '(Hex said:) when hex saw how much hisy size was ...""     foo 'which?' is the one morphologically simple interrogative which has no
noninterrogative counterpart. In embedded questions, foo can be retained but wala Or,
whether' may be added at the beginning of the clause to make its interrogative status
clear, as in (314).(314)          yee           kaa ta hää       ga
               ISgSImpf      come Inf inquire 3SgO

               [a      si          tuuri]]
               [3SgS ImpfNeg reply]]
                  was coming to ask him for what reason did he not respond when I
                greeted him.'

verb, the direct object being expressed as the noun addelill di 'the reason' with an
attached Rel clause (Ί asked [to him] the reason for which ...').
     The compound interrogatives (§8.2.3) are generally quite easy to embed, since
most of them already consist of a generic noun plus foo 'which?'. The corresponding
embedded questions omit the foo and show up as heads of relatives. For mise foo (and
variants) 'how?' and taka foo 'how?', both literally 'way (=manner) which?', we get
embeddings like those in (315).(315)    a. bara      addama-jje ma          bey

5.8 Markers of discourse status
5.8.1 Focus (Foe na and SFoc rjga)Focalized constituents (as we use the term here) are always fronted to a position
preceding the remainder of the clause. This is most obvious with constituents that are
otherwise postverbal, such as direct objects and adpositional complements. Since
subjects are clause-initial anyway, their focalization does not produce an obvious
""fronting,"" but one can argue nonetheless that fronting occurs here too.
     The usual markers of focalization are Subject Focus (SFoc) qga, inserted
obligatorily between a focalized subject and the following material (MAN morphemes,
then VP), and non-subject Focus (Foe) na, which can be omitted under some
conditions but is usually present after an NP (or adverbial) fronted from post-verbal
position. Simple examples are in (129).(129)    a. ay          ijga      gar       ga
            ISg         SFoc      find      3SgO

            'What [focus] are you looking for?' (nonsubject focus)   For fuller discussion of the syntax, see §8.1.1-2. Historically, na reflects a weak
demonstrative *no 'there' and is therefore related etymologically to identificational
                                                5.5 Markers of discourse status       101quasi-verb nono 'it is', §7.1.1. (KS has no as both a focalizer and a reduced 'there'
demonstrative.) SFoc rjga is intriguingly homophonous to 3SgF pronoun rjga (§8.4.2).
There is considerable variation in the form of SFoc morphemes throughout the KCh-
DjCh-KS zone, permitting speakers of each dialect to make different morphemic
associations (with attendant ""deep"" syntactic analysis) for the SFoc marker.
     It is doubtful that either na or rjga forms a surface constituent, strictly speaking,
with the preceding focalized constituent. If it did, one would expect that the particle
would occur as part of truncated WH questions ('who?') and as part of truncated replies
to WH questions (Q: 'What did you find?'; A: ""The dog'). However, na and rjga are
never used in this way; the truncated interrogative or reply consists simply of the
focalized interrogative pronoun or NP. The truncated form of (129b) is maa 'what?',
not #maa na, and that of (129a) is ay T, not #ay rjga.
     NPs (and PPs) are not the only constituents that can be, in principle, focalized.
VPs can be focal (Q: 'What did you do?'; Α: Ί cried'), as can truth values ('Yes I did
see him'). However, in KCh there is no overt grammatical marking of verb, VP, or
truth-value focus. In practice, ""focus"" applies to NPs, PPs, and adverbials like 'here'
and 'today' which can be analysed as reduced or defective NPs.","[116, 117]"

"     The question arises whether to take marje ~ merje as basically an adjective or a
noun. If we take it as a lexical adjective, the modifying use (300b) is unproblematic.
The use as NP head (300a,d-e) would then be interpreted as involving a zero Absol
prefix (§4.4.3, §4.5.1), which is slightly awkward but not outlandish. If we take it as
a noun, the head-noun use is straightforward, but the apparently modifying use would
have to be reinterpreted as involving a loose compound NP marje in which the NP
has partitive function ('how much of NP?').
     With equational ci 'be', merje takes postverbal position, as in the question in

9.7.6 Quantifying and negative serial verbsHere we are concerned with serial verbs listed in (583d) in §9.7.2, above, that specify
the extent (positive or negative) to which the eventuality in question was realized.
     As a simple verb, hlsa can mean 'fix, prepare, cook (food), make, make well'.
Sometimes it simply denotes production, sometimes it stresses the thoroughness or
high quality of the work of production or repair. As a serial verb, the general sense is
'VP very much, VP a lot'. It is common with verbs denoting gradient adjectival
qualities, as in (595a), but it also occurs with other kinds of VP denoting measurable
activities, as in (595b).(595)    a.   a        tiisa     [ka     sendu]
              3SgS do-very [Inf          be-difficult]
              'It (=food) has become very expensive.'
         b.   woo ci baana kaa yer         tiisa      [ka gey-nda—,  a    oinne]
              Dem be rain Rel 1 PIS do-very [Inf endure-with—, 3Sg peer]
              'This was a rain, which we have gone a very long time without the
               likes of it.'",[329]
"     In both the enumerating and possessive constructions, the pronoun in question
precedes the quantifier. When the quantifier is kul 'all', we get clearcut enumerating
expressions like war kul 'all of you(Pl)'. However, with numerals, the preferred
96      5 Nominal inflection and NP syntaxsurface expression adds a head noun distinct from the pronoun. The usual noun used for
this purpose is boro 'person', as in (119).(119)          yer     boro      hinja
               1P1     person    three
               'we three'       Here yer might be said to be in apposition to boro or perhaps to boro hinja. But
it is also possible to construe (119) syntactically as a possessive expression, glossable
as Our three persons' (cf. English the three of us). This is because possessors
(including pronominal possessors) precede the heads nouns they modify and only
optionally take Poss postposition wane (§4.1.5, §5.2.1).
       What then about unambiguously possessive constructions like Our three'
(simplified from Our three dogs' or the like), with an unexpressed but understood head
noun? The expected maximal version of this is of the type [yer ( wane )] 0 i-hinja,
lit. '[1P1 (Poss)] 0 Absol-three,' with ""0"" representing the vacant head-noun slot. This
is quite grammatical and relevant examples occur in texts. However, again bow
'person' is optionally added as a dummy noun stem, sometimes even when the referent
in question is nonhuman, as in (120).(120)          yer    (wane)       boro      hinja
               1P1    (Poss)       person    three
               Our three'     Note that possessive (120) is distinguishable from enumerating (119) only by the
presence of the optional Poss postposition, and the latter is more often omitted than
present. The syntactic distinction between enumerating and possessive types is
therefore shaky. For an English parallel note the phrasing of the three of us, which has
enumerating function but which is expressed in possessive form (of).","[111, 112]"
"
8.4.3 Use of weak Topic marker taThe morpheme ta is quite common and versatile, so much so that it is difficult to
gloss. We will label it ""Top,"" but will often refer to it as a ""weak"" topic marker to
contrast it with Top bine and 3SgF rjga (see the preceding two sections).
     This fa, which follows the topical constituent in question, is to be distinguished
from two other common ta morphemes. One is a variant, used after kaa 'come', of
Infinitival] ka, hence kaa ta VP (§9.G.7). The other is a Future morpheme used only
after Impf o - go (§7.2.5). Any fa in the texts which does not follow kaa 'come' or
Impf o - go can be safely identified as the Top morpheme
     Weak Top fa is common with preposed topical NPs, as in (372). In this case, if
the referent in question recurs (in any syntactic function) in the following core
sentence, we get a resumptive pronoun. If the preposed constituent is a spatiotemporal
adverbial there is no resumptive element. The structures are the same as the preposed
topics, with or without bine, described in §8.4.1.(372)         a.   [[woo yo ta]       kul] bara ni       nda gi      ma     hagga

                   'All these (tools)x, you and theyx must be inseparable.'

                   now           Top       tea      become      1P1 custom
                   '(By) now, tea has become a custom of ours.'",[227]
"     This pattern is very common and may be considered the normal treatment of
generic referents in simple passages. However, it is also possible for boro in generic
function to be repeated in subsequent mentions as boro or as a 3Sg pronoun. This
pattern can be applied when for some reason it is inappropriate to offer the addressee an
opportunity to symbolically enter the role of the generic personnage in question, or
(more cogently) in passages where the 2Sg category has been pre-empted by a distinct
discourse referent, denoting either the addressee as such or a second generic discourse
referent.
     This is the case in the examples in (669). In (669a), 2Sg is initially used to
denote the addressee in a (meta-)pragmatic comment, after which 2Sg is used
generically. When a second generic discourse referent is introduced as boro 'someone'
in 'you call for someone,' it must remain distinct from 2Sg and so is mentioned in
3Sg form (a) in the following subjunctive clause. In (669b), two distinct generic
discourse referents (subscripted indices ""p"" and ""t"" in the free translation) are introduced
as boro. The first is then repeated in 2Sg form, which forces the second to adopt 3Sg
agreement (a in a na dam).(669)    a.   woo daa           na yee          bar     mana        rjga!,

"     In (272a), the NP positions clearly coindexed with the focused constituent are in
the second and third clauses of a three-clause sequence ('we bend over, we look at
themx, we touch them x ') which functions en bloc as a conditional antecedent bound by
nda 'if. Note gi 'them' twice as a resumptive pronoun coindexed with the focused
constituent 'bits'. There is no clearly coindexed trace in the main clause ('we find that
small chunks are in it'), although one might argue adventurously that 'bits' occurs

pronoun 'it' is the subject of a 'that' clause subordinated to the verb 'notice'.
      There remains the question whether Foe morpheme na forms a constituent with
the preceding fronted constituent, serves as a complementizer introducing the
following core sentence, or has an independent syntactic status. In other words, is
English Beans I like or clefted It's beans that I like (with complementizer that) the
better syntactic parallel to the KCh na construction? I find it difficult to make this
decision on empirical rather than theory-internal grounds.
      In the focus construction, the fronted constituent and the core sentence are, in
general, tightly knit prosodically. There are occasional textual examples where one
detects a brief pause after na, but hesitations can also occur after that in English clefts
due to processing considerations, cf. the free translation of (272b). Examples like
(271) could be taken as evidence that na is bracketed with the preceding focalized
constituent, but only if we consider the material intervening between na and the trace-
containing clause as being completely outside the focalization construction. However,
it is preferable to bracket the type in (271) as 'NPX na [[we come] and [we share /, ]],'
with the 'come' and 'share' clauses fused together (cf. §9.5.2), in which case we have
no new information about how to bracket the na.
      If na formed a constituent with the focalized constituent, it would be reasonable to
expect the two to occur together in truncated replies to WH questions. But na cannot
surface after a bare focalized constituent. This is shown by the exchange in (273).","[184, 185]"

normally fronted and occur in one of the focus constructions. This pattern is very
strong for 'who?', 'what?', 'where?', 'when?', and 'how?'. On the other hand, the
interrogatives foo 'which?' and merje 'how much? how many?', when functioning as
modifiers within larger NPs, optionally remain in place (in situ) in the core sentence.
This is probably because the larger NP would have to be fronted as a whole, and
""heavy"" NPs are less easy to front than are simple interrogatives like 'who?'.

10.1.2 Logophorics and deictic shifts in reported speechWe begin by noting that KCh has no analogue to the tense shifts that typically occur
in reported (past) speech in languages like English, where Ί want a mango' is reported
as 'she said she wanted a mango.' The basic KCh VP categories are imperfective and
(unmarked) perfective aspect, which require no adjustment due to the temporal
displacement of reporting past speech. Schematically, Ί Impf want [mango one]'
becomes [3Sg say, LogoSg Impf want [mango one]].
     The most systematic indexical shift in reported speech is the replacement of
original first person pronouns by a type of pronoun known as ""logophoric,"" which is
used only for this purpose. In KCh, logophoric pronouns are identical in form to third
person reflexive (""3Refl"") pronouns. The basic Logo/3ReflSg pronoun is ijgu, with
plural counterpart ggu-yo or ggi-yo, the latter variant homophonous to the plural of
3SgF pronoun rjga (§5.8.2, §8.4.2). For analysis of the forms, with further variants,
see §3.8.8.
     Logo/3ReflSg ijgu ~ ηυ is easy to distinguish from 3SgF rjga in most
environments. However, both combine with a following Impf o to give phonetic
[qgo:]. Our transcriptional system uses underlying representations plus a ligature to
indicate that contraction (§3.7.1) has occurred, hence we write qgu^ ο or qga^ ο
depending on which pronoun is involved. Readers working through published texts
presented with this ligature format should appreciate that each such transcription
represents an interpretation of the text fragment in question. On occasion a serious
analyst of KCh texts may disagree with the transcriber's interpretation, or conclude
that alternative readings are possible.
     In interlinear glosses, I not only distinguish between ""3F* and ""Logo/3Refl""
forms, I also try to specify logophoric and reflexive functions of the latter. This
functional distinction is often straightforward, but in quite a few textual instances the
pronoun in question has both functions. For example, in 'shex said [she, would prepare
herselfj,' 'herself,' is both 3Refl (within its clause) and Logo (coindexed with the
quoted speaker). In ambiguous or doubly-marked cases we will use the noncommittal
""Logo/3Refl"" label in interlinears. It is also possible to have doubly logophoric
pronouns, as in 'she, said [shex would tell him [to hit her,]],' where the final pronoun
324     10 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speechhas the same referent as antecedent at two higher levels, but we do not distinguish
double from single logophoricity in interlinears.
    Examples of (nonreflexive) logophoric pronouns are in (619).(619)     a.   i-i         bar [ngu-yo        gaazwal     hay] goo^ a        ra,

3.5.8 Stem-initial consonant clustersAside from recent loanwords, mainly from French, the only word-initial clusters are in
morphemes beginning with a nasal followed by a homorganic obstruent or nasal. The
attested clusters are mb, nn, nd, nt, nj, nc, qg, and qk. Examples: mbaaga 'lizard sp.',
nnori 'ant sp.', ndaamakolooti 'chameleon', ntende 'ant sp.', njarka 'native violin',
ncom~n£am 'mouse\qgorfu 'vine sp.', and qkanji 'tick'. As this selection suggests,
the stems in question are nouns rather than verbs, and involve biological or cultural
vocabulary, especially fauna, rather than basic vocabulary such as kin terms and body
parts. Perhaps they were originally borrowings from a language with a noun-class
prefix something like *aN- (the vowel is preserved in HS), or regionally distributed
words with an ultimate origin in such a language. However, there are indications that
some cases of this initial cluster type are secondary, reflecting a certain productivity for
the nasal ""prefix"" in the biological domain. (It seems especially productive in some
upriver dialects, especially around Dir6.)
     As noted in §3.5.2, initial nasal-obstruent clusters also occur in a handful of
grammatical morphemes. The examples are nda 'with, and', Logo/3ReflSg qgu, and
3SgF qga, plus the plural counterparts of these latter two.
                                    3.6 Consonantal assimilations and deletions      29     The initial clusters mentioned in this section are not entirely stable. Some of the
nouns in question also have variants without the initial nasal, nda 'with, and' has a
variant pronunciation na, and Logo/3ReflSg ijgu has a similar variant qu.","[44, 45]"
"    Literally, this is '... for which reason [I greeted himx hex did not reply],' both
verbs in the embedded question being imperfective. Clearly the WH interrogative has
been extracted from 'he did not reply,' while greeted him/ functions as background.
    The verb jo w can be used as a simple transitive 'take', or a serial verb meaning
'do energetically'; see (594) in §9.7.5. It is rarely attested with a following
imperfective indicative clause in the sense 'keep doing (a long time)', as in (503).(503)         i      jow     i-i         dira,     hal        i        too...

     Normally, two or more disjuncts linked by wala must be of the same syntactic
and semantic types (e.g., both are clauses, or both are NPs). However, the same kinds
of nominal catch-all expressions used to end an NP disjunction (§5.11.5) may be used
in the same function with clausal disjunctions, especially in a negative context, as in

"The basic 'whatchamacallit?' expressions are hajje (variant haya-jje) and haywana.

see §3.8.3). The second form may be a variant of hay wane with Poss wane.
     These forms are used as indefinites ('something or other, gizmo, thingamajig') or
in self-directed questions ('whatchamacallit?'). In either case, they replace more precise

locational quasi-verb 500 'be' or sii 'not be' (295a) and with equational ci (296b-c). In
the case of ci, overt focalization with SFoc tjga is optionally omitted, as in (298a-c),
contrast (298d) with qga present. With gga absent, the WH-word may occur in
preverbal (298a-b) or postverbal (298c) position.(298)    a. me£ ci         woo ?

8.5.6 Similative 'like X' (sanda, allaa, taka, Sinne)We discuss here the two basic Similative particles, sanda and allaa, and combinations
involving compound finals taka, wise, and Sinne.
    sanda is a particle that can sometimes be glossed 'like', preceding the constituent
in question. Examples in (415).

"     Here war^ nda cere (plus Emph daa) is a fronted focalized NP in subject
function. Since a true Instr-Comit prepositional phrase cannot occur in such a
position, we might consider taking nda here as the NP conjunction 'and', but this
makes no sense since war '2 is plural and already denotes the full set of able-bodied
men in question, which is expressed as an afterthought by war baalici di yo 'you
adult men'. So there is no alternative to taking nda cere as a quantifying expression,
not unlike kul 'all' but emphasizing joint (cooperative) action rather than simple
universality. Incidentally, the predicate guna cere 'see each other' (by extension
'compete as rivals for public approval') in the same sentence is a true reciprocal.
     cere may occur in deverbal nominalizations, preserving its reciprocal functions,
as in (666). We hyphenate these compounds.

"     The freedom with which the two NPs in an equational ci clause switch positions
reflects the fact that this is the only transitive verb which is commutative in the
mathematical sense, A ci B being logically interchangeable with B ci A. Another
syntactic consequence of this is that when one of the equated constituents is focalized,
it is always treated as the subject. Therefore we can get overt SFoc gga but never
(nonsubject) Foe na in WH interrogatives and other focalized ci sentences.
Corresponding to the pattern A ijga ci B 'it is A [focus] that is B' seen in (296b-c),
we never get #A na B ci 'it is Ax [focus] that B is tx.'
     mey 'who?' and maa 'what?' may occur in the conjoined NP construction X nda
Y 'X and Y'. They take the ""Y"" position following nda 'and, with'. The entire
conjunction is normally fronted, as in (299).(299)    a.   [ni      nda     mey]         na    a         kar
              [2Sg     and     who?] Foe 3SgS               hit

              'You and who (else) killed it?'     mey 'who?' and maa 'what?' normally take singular form, even when it is not
known what the number of denoted referents is. However, they may take PI yo to
specify plurality (295b, 296b).
     We next consider marje ~ merje. This form can be used syntactically as a full-
fledged NP (300a,d-e), or it may quantify over an indefinite noun (300b) with no
change in form. When denoting the price of a commodity ('for ten riyals'), there is
generally no 'for' postposition although the constituent with marje ~ merje functions

"       However, a preposed topical NP does not require such a ""resumptive"" pronoun.
                           2. l Brief outline of typical sentence and NP structures    13     Occasionally a NP with topic marking is treated as part of the sentence proper,
namely as its subject NP. In this case, the MAN morphemes and the VP immediately
follow the topic-marked subject NP.
     While topic-marked NPs are generally sentence-external, focalized NPs are clearly
part of sentential syntax even though the focused NP (or PP) is always fronted
(=extracted). (We use ""preposed"" or in connection with sentence-external elements such
as most topic-marked NPs, ""fronted"" or ""extracted"" for sentence-internal movement
associated with focalization, WH-interrogatives, and perhaps relativization). In KCh,
unlike KS, extraction normally leaves behind a phonologically zero trace (rather than a
resumptive pronoun).
     The focalization system sharply distinguishes subject focus from other focus
structures. If the grammatical subject is the focus, the morpheme rjga occurs between
subject NP and the remainder of the sentence (16).(16)          ay        qga      guna      ga
              ISg       SFoc     see        3SgO
              Ί [focus] saw him (her).' (= 'It was I [no-one else] who saw ...')    Without the SFoc morpheme, there would be no way to tell that the subject has
been focalized, since subjects precede MAN morphemes and VPs. SFoc ijga is
phonologically identical with a ""Full"" (nonclitic) 3Sg pronoun which we label
""3SgF."" This raises the possibility of construing SFoc .rjga as a kind of subject
resumptive pronoun: the subject NP, here ay (ISg), is shifted to the left, out of the
subject position into a special focus slot, whereby a type of 3Sg subject pronoun
appears in the true subject position. However, this analysis is only one of the
possibilities to be explored later, and it is problematic for the upriver dialects.
    For non-subject focus, the normal KCh construction is to front (extract) the
focused constituent, adding Focus morpheme na before the subject NP. This pattern is
especially common in WH questions and responses to such questions (17).(17)         maa           na    no-o              taasi?
             what?         Foe 2SgS-Impf           seek
             'What [focus] are you seeking (=doing here)?'","[28, 29]"
"
7.1.2 Locational quasi-verbs goo, siiThe basic locational predicators are goo 'be (in a place)' and its negation sii 'not be (in
a place), be absent'. Each is normally followed by a more concrete LP (locational
phrase, §5.12) such as a place name, adverbial, or PP. I refer to them loosely as
""quasi-verbs,"" but their peculiarities are different from those of other quasi-verbs
described in the adjoining sections. Examples in (234).(234)    a. i        goo       nee
            3P1S     be        here
            'They are here.'
         b. a        sii              [huu      di       ra]
            3SgS     be-absent [house           Def      Loc]
            'He (She, It) is not in the house.'     goo is clearly related to Impf (positive) ο ~ go (<*go), as is sii to ImpfNeg si. In
sentences with ordinary verbs, ο and si are members of the set of MAN (mood-aspect-
negation) morphemes that intervene between subject NP and verb (§7.2.1). That the
connection between {goo sii} and the cognate imperfect!ve morphemes ο ~ go and si is
synchronically real is shown by the fact that the imperfective morphemes are
pronounced goo and sii in the one situation where they are clause-final; namely, in
truncated replies to yes-no questions and similar echoes (§8.2.1). Moreover, locational
{goo sii} cannot be preceded by MAN morphemes (#o goo, #ma goo, etc.).
     If we were to assume that the ""verb"" position is obligatorily filled in any
predicate, the preferred analysis of (234a-b) would be to take {goo sii} as verbs, albeit
a special type of verbs which do not allow MAN morphemes. Alternatively, since
these quasi-verbs are apparently morphemically identical to the cognate preverbal
MAN morphemes, one could argue that {goo sii} in (234a-b) are simply stressed
allomorphs of Impf (positive) ο ~ go and ImpfNeg si, used when the following verb
position is vacant (a possibility limited to locationals). The two analyses lead to the
alternative parsings in (235a-b) for sentence (234a).(235)            subject NP      MAN morphemes           verb             locational
              a.     i               0                   goo                nee
              b.     /               goo                 0                  nee

on the general approach (235b), represented here as (235c-d). In (235c), goo is a MAN
morpheme as in (235b), but the verb position is filled by a ""light"" (i.e. low-content)
verb BE that happens to be phonologically null. In (235d) we have started out with the
                                                        7.1 Types of predicates       149same structure, but the MAN morpheme goo has then been fused or adjoined to BE,
perhaps leaving a (coindexed) trace tx behind.
      In (235c-d), we might equate the BE verb specifically with bara 'be, exist'
(following section). In any event, forms with overt bara are closely related
syntactically to the goo and sii sentences we have been discussing. There are three
syntactic contexts where goo and sii are syntactically impossible, and where
constructions involving bara are used instead. First, goo and sii cannot be used in
subjunctives, where they are replaced by, respectively, the positive and negative
subjunctive of bara. The subjunctive equivalent of (234a) is therefore / ma bara nee
'that they be here.' Second, goo and sii cannot be used in imperatives, so we again
make use of the subjunctive of bara to fill the void; see (266) in §7.3. Third, goo is
not allowed in infinitival VPs, again requiring the use of bara, as in ... ka bara nee
'... to be here.' We can therefore get a very close approximation to the surface facts by
arguing that there is an underlying existential-locative BE verb which is realized as
zero following imperfective morphemes, and as bara elsewhere. In order to actually
formalize this analysis, we would have to distinguish this BE, realized as (0 ~ bara,},
from bara2 in the sense 'exist', since bara2 can occur after Impf as well as other MAN
morphemes (following section). In any event, existential-locative BE is clearly distinct
from equational or identificational quasi-verbs (oi 'be', ποπό 'it is') described above.
      Although goo and sii in (234a-b) are basically locational rather than pure
existentials, in some textual occurrences the following LP seems to be nearly pro
forma, and the clause comes close to a pure existential predication with little emphasis
on location. The favorite ""bleached"" locationals used for this purpose are doodi ~ dooti
'there* and third person pronominal Locative PPs such as a ra 'in it, therein'. Both
occur in (236), which describes how one detects limestone deposits in the bush; the
key phrases are bolded in the free translation as well as in the interlinears.(236)        jombu-jombu woo di                ye na nda yer guqguma

doodi 'there' have at least vestiges of a locational denotation, but in passages like this
the location has already been established in prior discourse. In other cases, the location

(238)         a          goo
              3SgS       be
              'Here she is!Or ""There she is!'     (238) is usually rendered as la voila or la void in local French and has a similar
presentative quality. For more on presentatives, see §7.2.3.
     There is another, completely different use of a goo and similar combinations of a
pronoun with goo or sii, only superficially identical to the presentative type (238).
This is the pattern exemplified by a 500 '(Yes) it is' and ay sii '(No) I don't' used in
truncated replies to yes-no questions and in similar echoing contexts (§8.2.1). This
type has no presentative or locational-existential connotations.
     Locational quasi-verbs have no difficulty occurring in relativized or focus
constructions. Examples in (239).(239)    a.   maa        rjga      goo    nee ?
              what?      S Foe be         here?
              'What [focus] is here?'
         b.   har     di       kaa     goo     nee
              man Def          Rel     be      here
              'the man who is here'
         c.   man        na        a      goo ?
              where?     Foe       3SgS be ?
              'Where [focus] is he?'     (239c) and similar instances with clause-final 500 (or sii) only superficially
resemble the presentative type (238). (239c), unlike (238), does have an overt LP
complement, the only difference being that in (239c) the LP (man 'where?') has been
fronted as part of the focalization process that is regular with WH interrogatives. We
could represent (239c) as manx na a goo tx with a phonologically unrealized trace to
make this clear.
                                                        7.1 Types of predicates     1517.1.3 Existential and impersonal quasi-verb baraThe form bara occurs in several constructions. We disregard here the 'except'
construction with following NP (§8.5.3) and the clause-initial use as a 'because'
complementizer (§9.5.7), in order to focus on its verbal and quasi-verbal uses.
     First, bara is used in the normal verb position (following a subject NP and MAN
morphemes) as an existential predicator 'exist'. We have noted in the preceding section
that locationals of the type 'be there' or 'be in it' can also be used in a fashion
approaching existential predications, so the use of bara as an existential is somewhat
circumscribed. In general, bara is preferred when the existant is abstract, unlocalized,
or too diffuse to be meaningfully localized. Examples in (240).(240)    a.   saa      kaa       keydiya^      ο       bara
              time     Rel       monsoon       Impf    be
              'when there is a (good) rainy season'
         b.   saa      kaa       keydiya       si         bara
              time     Rel       monsoon       ImpfNeg    be
              'when there is no rainy season'     Note that bara can be preceded by Impf o or ImpfNeg si. The ability to appear
after MAN morphemes distinguishes bara from locational quasi-verbs goo and sii
(§7.1.2) and from identificational nono (§7.1.1). Note also that bara does not require a
following LP (locational phrase), though such a phrase could be added to (240a-b).
     bara replaces locational goo in certain constructions where goo is syntactically
impermissible. This use of bara does not translate easily as 'exist', so it may be
useful to recognize a distinct abstract locational BE that is realized as 0 after
imperfective morphemes and as bara, elsewhere, distinct from bara2 'exist', as
suggested in the preceding section. Negative locational sii is likewise replaced by a
negated form of bara2. These replacements occur in the subjunctive mood with ma,
which cannot co-occur with {goo sii} or with the imperfective morphemes related to
the latter; an example is (241a). Using ""L"" to represent the locational, X goo L 'X is
in L* has subjunctive counterpart X ma bara L 'that X may be in L,' while its
negation X sii L 'X is not in L' becomes X ma si bara L 'that X may not be in
L'. Likewise, in the infinitival VP construction with Inf ka, bara replaces goo. In
(241b), the infinitival construction is required by serial verb hima.(241)    a.   yee          baa ay        ma       bara nee jirjgar ban
              ISgSImpf want ISgS Subju be               here holiday day
              Ί want to be here on the day of the (Muslim) holiday.'
         b.   a-a             hima       ka     bara    bamako
              3SgS-Impf       ought      Inf    be      Bamako
              'He ought to be in Bamako.'","[164, 165, 166, 167]"

3.10.6 Loss of final short vowelStem-final high vowels {i u} have been dropped without trace in many *CVVCV
stems. This process has occurred in Timbuktu KCh and in DjCh, but not in the
upriver KCh towns such as Niafunko, and it is an interesting piece of evidence for
direct relations between Timbuktu and Djenne"". For the vowel to be dropped, it is
necessary that the resulting C,VVC2 shape be pronounceable, which effectively limits
the process to stems with a sonorant C2 and excludes stems where the long VV is high
{// uu}. Examples of vowel dropping are beer 'be big', moor 'be distant', yoon 'rub
in, anoint', doon 'millet cream', and taam 'pair of shoes'. Compare KS beer;, mooru,
yoonu, doonu, and taami. The process does not apply when the consonant in question
is an obstruent, so the bisyllabic form is always preserved in cases like yoobu 'market'
andjeesi 'tilt'. I know of no case where the final vowel has been dropped in a stem
with long high vowel, so stems like tuuru 'reply' and jiiri 'year* remain bisyllabic.
(For further evidence regarding the historical role of long high vowels, see the
following section).
     There are some stems that satisfy the conditions for the process which for some
reason also preserve the bisyllabic shape, e.g., jaari 'day', maani '(animal) fat'.
     The examples known to me which undergo this *CVVCV —> C,VVC2 reduction
have a C2 from the set {r n m}. It is difficult to say whether the absence of 7 and the
semivowels { w y] from the inventory is accidental. Among the stems which do not
reduce are laali 'be cursed (unfortunate)' and haawi 'be ashamed; shame'. Since certain
stems even with C2 {r n m} do not reduce for reasons which are not entirely clear
(/aari and maa/ii were just mentioned), I cannot determine whether examples like laali
and haawi are similar isolated exceptions, or whether their C2 is incompatible with the
52     3 Phonologyreduction. It may be relevant that haawi, though now functioning as verb or noun, is
likely to represent an original nominalization *haaw-i.
     Comparisons like KCh JUT with KS zuru 'run', and KCh wir with KS wiri 'seek',
indicate that either KCh has dropped an original final vowel or that KS has added an
echo vowel. The cases in question are of the shape Cir(i) or Cur(u) with tap r and
short high vowel(s). Since KS also has some inherited verbs of the shape Cur without
echo vowel (KCh = KS dur 'pound grain'), it is possible that KCh was the innovator
and that the reconstructions are *zuru, * wiri, and *dur as in KS.","[67, 68]"

                                   Introduction
1.1 Generalities about SonghaySonghay is often described loosely as a ""language,"" but in fact it is a large complex of
varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages. Languages of the
Songhay family are linguistically dominant in northeastern Mali along the Niger
River, and others of the family occupy much of the Republic of Niger (""Kaado"" and
""Zarma""). Additional varieties are spoken in Bonin, and perhaps still residually in the
Dori area of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). Some ""nomadic"" or ""northern""
Songhay languages, not yet well studied, are spoken by small beduin groups in far
northern Niger, with one offshoot each extending into Mali ('Tadaksahak"" near
Menaka) and in southwestern Algeria (""Korandje"" in the Tabelbala oasis). The major
work on the internal genetic classification of Songhay varieties is that of Nicola'i
(1981), who puts considerable emphasis on sound changes and phonological typology.
     My work on Songhay has focused to date on the four main varieties spoken in
Mali. The following sets of designations are partially interchangeable. One set
consists of transcriptions of the native terms; the second is simply the name (in
English or French) of the respective major town; the third is the cardinal-direction
system developed by Nicola'i.        native term         major city or town    NicolaTs term

         humburi senn-i     Hombori               central Songhay (S. central)     For Gao, koroboro senn-i co-occurs with other variants such as koyra senn-i and
koyra senn-e.
     The nouns ciini and senn-i ~ senn-i (with variant senn-e ~ senn-e) are noncognate,
though both mean 'speech, speaking, language', cf. verbs cii (<*ciin) and selaq -
seien. In the cases of Djenne and Hombori, both of which are (in effect) Songhay
enclaves rather than parts of extended Songhay-speaking regions, the first term of the
compound is simply the name of the town. Timbuktu and Gao, on the other hand, are
merely the largest cities in extended Songhay-speaking regions, and the terms for these
varieties are more general: koyra-ciini 'town language' and koroboro-senn-i
(contraction of koyra-boro senn-i 'town-person language') distinguish the sedentary
Songhays from the nomadic Arabs and Tuaregs. The Songhay are also sometimes
called 'river people' (Timbuktu isa-boro), but no related expression for their language
is in common use.
     For the native sense of sonoy, see beginning of §1.2.
     We will use the informal transcription ""Koyra Chiini"" to denote the unbroken
koyra ciini complex of dialects in the region along and near the Niger River beginning
2   1 Introduction with Timbuktu. This includes the towns of Dire"", Tonka, Goundam, and Niafunke
 going upriver (west) from Timbuktu. There is a thinly populated northern extension in
 Araouane, on the caravan route from Timbuktu to Taoudenni. There is a relatively
 sharp linguistic break between Koyra Chiini and Koroboro Senni (the ""Gao"" variety)
just east of Timbuktu. Koroboro Senni is the traditional language even of Gourma
 Rharous and Bamba, the first important towns on the Niger River going east from
Timbuktu.
      Most of my Koyra Chiini data are from Timbuktu itself. I have a corpus of some
 six hours of transcribed recordings, mostly dyadic (interviews, conversations, or
 narratives with an interactive listener). I have supplemented this data base with elicited
material obtained chiefly in the final field sessions (1996-97).
      I also have some transcribed recordings from Niafunke"" and Goundam, which can
 serve as representatives of the larger complex of ""upriver"" dialects (""upriver"" from the
perspective of Timbuktu). I also spent about a week in this area in 1996 to clear up
 some problems in the analysis of these tapes and to do some follow-up elicitation and
ethnobiological vocabulary elicitation and specimen collection. A summary of
observable differences between the upriver dialects and the Timbuktu dialect is given in
the short Appendix 1. In the much larger Appendix 2, I describe the distinctive and
 geographically separated variety of Djenno, which I refer to as ""Djenne Chiini"" (for
jenne ciini, literally ""Djenn6 language""). Abbreviations for the Malian Songhay
 languages and varieties used in this grammar are KCh (Koyra Chiini, the present
object of study), DjCh (Djenne Chiini), KS (Koroboro Senni of Gao, etc.), and HS
 (Humburi Senni of Hombori). Names of other Songhay languages are not abbreviated.
      The wider genetic affiliation of Songhay is controversial. It is one of the few
African languages for which Joseph Greenberg (1966) did not make a confident
assignment to a large genetic stock, though he suggested Nilo-Saharan as a possible
connection. Nicolai (1984, 1990) has suggested a possible Creole origin in which
Tamashek (Tuareg) played a major lexifying role, but this has not won wide
acceptance. It might be advisable to defer reconsideration of the wider affiliation of the
 Songhay complex until we have better descriptions of the several varieties within the
complex and can thus do serious reconstruction of Proto-Songhay.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"     Consider first that portion of Ql which is external to Q2. In this zone, any
mention of X is expressed as LogoSg on the grounds that it is coindexed with the
quoted speaker; Υ is expressed in this zone as a simple 3Sg pronoun. Within Q2,
which is also part of Ql, any mention of either X or Υ will be expressed as LogoSg,
since each is coindexed with a quoted speaker, albeit at different levels. To the listener,
the surface structure corresponding to Q2 in (625) is ambiguous, since each LogoSg
pronoun in Q2 could correspond to either X or Y.
     Because Logo is an obligatory category when its conditions are met, the use of
ordinary 3Sg or 3P1 pronouns within a quotation specifically indicates that the referent
in question is distinct from that of the attributed speaker. Consider (626), a
modification of (625) with a 3Sg pronoun in the embedded quotation.",[342]
"     Note that some of the combinations in question involve a second verb of motion
in the infinitival VP. Such combinations are likely to be semi-frozen and idiomatic,
and might be described as compounds, jur 'run', for example, seems to occur as serial
verb chiefly in JUT ka kaa 'come running' and jur ka koy 'go running'.
     Another set of verbs that are commonly combined with a following infinitival VP
are verbs denoting actions that take place at particular times of day: biyaa 'VP in early
morning', hanna 'VP all night, VP at night, stay up at night VP-ing', and hoy 'VP
in the middle of the day'. An example of this construction is (602), and variations
with hanna and hoy are also possible.(602)         ay     biyaa               [ka koy]
              ISgS do-in-morning [Inf go]
              Ί went (away) early in the morning.'",[332]
"     The regular output of (65 la) has a 3Refl possessor for 'dog', on clause-internal
grounds (coindexation with the subject of 'eat'). The question then is whether the
possessor of 'dog' is also expressed as 3Refl in (65 Ib) on the grounds of coindexation
with the more distant matrix subject. If so, (65 la) and (65 Ib) will be indistinguishable
on the surface.
     It appears that long-distance reflexive binding usually does not occur in (65 Ib),
so the two constructions generally remain distinct. An example of (65 Ib) is (652).(652)         a-a         fa wii bar di kaa jow [a                wane njerfu di]
              3SgS-Impf Put kill man Def Rel          take [3 S g Poss money Def]
              'Shex will kill the many whoy took herx money.'",[355]

9.5.10 Right-edge marking in antecedents and background clausesIn conditional constructions, the antecedent ('if...') sometimes contains more than one
clause. The left edge (onset) of the antecedent is marked by nda ... 'if ...', but since
nda need not be repeated in each clause of a multi-clause antecedent, the question arises
how the addressee knows where the antecedent ends and the consequent begins.
Although there is no obligatory marking of the right edge of the antecedent, the forms
listed in (537), and perhaps on occasion others, may be used in this function, kul and
dee, unlike the others, can also be pronounced at the onset of the following
consequent clause (cf. English then in 'if..., then ...' conditionals).

              nin          Only'                §8.5.2, example (393)
              moo          'also'               §8.5.5, example (413b)
              di           Definite             §5.6      The common right-edge marker is kul 'all', in bare form without Absolute prefix
a- or i-. If we wish to attribute the usual universal quantificational sense to this use of
kul, two possibilities come to mind. One is that kul means something like 'any time
...', a stronger version of 'if ...'. The second is that kul here works at a higher
pragmatic level, indicating that the exposition of the antecedent material is completed
('that is all'). However, the frequency of kul at the right edge of antecedents, or at the
onset of consequents, suggests that this usage is grammaticalized (538).(538)         nda [n       taar gi]     kul     no-o        bey       kaa
              if [2SgS touch 3P1O] all          2SgS-Impf know that

              Dem      be       limestone
              'If you(Sg) touch them (=stones), you know that that is limestone.'","[302, 303]"
"
3.10.5 Palatalization of velarsMany stems now have c which reflects older *k, or j reflecting older *g. The velar
underwent palatalization (and affrication) before a front vowel */ or *e by a process
which still has some synchronic validity (§3.6.4), but in the stems in question the
lexical representation now has the palatoalveolar affricate rather than the original velar
stop.
     Examples are taaSi 'four' <*taaki, dide (alongside dike) for 'basket', jiji 'go up'
<*zigi (via *jigi), and kanje 'knee'. The original velars are preserved in each case in
one or more other Malian Songhay languages, and sometimes in upriver dialects or in
DjCh. Palatalization has also been spreading in KS, where reanalyses of lexical
representations are ongoing. This is therefore an interesting areal development cutting
across the basic language divisions, linking KS especially with the adjoining
Timbuktu variety of KCh.",[67]

'where?', merje-marje 'how many?"" or 'how much?', foo 'which?' (Absolute i-fod),
and mote 'how?'. Sentence examples are in §8.1.1-2 (fronted) and §8.2.4 (in situ).
    Plural mey yoo 'who?' is attested, though the unmarked singular is usual. PI
maa yoo 'what?' seems to be rare (compare maa yoo 'names').","[421, 422]"

5.11 Instrumental, comitative, and conjoined NPsnda is very common as a clause-initial 'if subordinator in the antecedent clause of a
conditional (§9.5.1). However, in the present chapter we are concerned with the syntax
and semantics of the sentence-internal phrase type nda NP. In the following sections
we interpret ""NP"" broadly to include pronouns and NP-like adverbials, except when (as
in §5.11.2) we speak specifically of ""full NPs"" (i.e., NPs headed by a noun stem).
     In the conjunction X nda Y, where X and Υ are NPs, the morpheme nda appears
at first glance to be an operator which handles its left and right conjuncts
symmetrically, producing a phrase of the same syntactic type as the conjuncts. In the
following two sections we will question the apparent symmetry of nda.
     The phrase type nda NP with a single overt argument NP is also common. It is
the basic instrumental phrase, and can also be used as a comitative phrase. It usually
functions semantically as part of a VP (see §5.11.3).
     As an 'and' conjunction, nda is restricted to conjoining syntactic NPs (including
pronouns) and NP-like adverbials. To a limited extent, it can also conjoin
postpositional phrases involving postpositions with noun-like character, but it does
not seem to work with the most highly grammaticalized postpositions and cannot
conjoin prepositional phrases (with Instr-Comit nda or with bilaa 'without', §5.11.6).
Furthermore, nda cannot be used as an 'and' conjunction linking two verbs, inflected
VPs, or clauses. The closest functional equivalent to ""conjunction"" in such cases is the
addition of an infinitival VP beginning in ka (§9.7.1, §6.3.2) to a preceding VP. When
nda is clause-initial, it functions not as an 'and' conjunction, rather as an 'if
conjunction in conditional antecedent clauses (§9.5.1).
     An apparent counterexample to the claim that nda 'and' is not used to conjoin
clauses is (156).
                               5.77 Instrumental, comitative, and conjoined NPs       113(156)         i-i        rjaa h ySi nda [ay si           bey hay kaa            yo]

              'They eat dog and [I don't know what (else)].'","[128, 129]"
"    See also (609) in §9.7.8, with several parallel subjunctive clauses.
    When the two disjuncts function as embedded polar (yes-no) interrogatives under a
verb of thinking or speaking ('know', 'find out', 'wonder', 'inquire'), it is usual to put
wala before all disjuncts. In this case the best translation is 'whether ..., or ...', as in
(506).(506)         bara a        ma     sii ni        ka     guna   ni
              must 3SgS Subju test 2SgO Inf             see    2SgO

              'He (=dwarf) will undoubtedly test you(Sg), to look at you, (to see)
               whether you are a man, or you are not a man.'",[289]

8.2.3 Composite WH-interrogatives ('how?', 'why?', 'when?')The most important compound interrogative phrases are those in (304).

common form for (304a) 'how?' or 'what sort (of thing)?' in the Timbuktu dialect.
The sense 'how?' is typically expressed by mise foox ... nda tx ? with a stranded
postverbal Instr-Comit preposition nda. Without this nda, mise foo normally
functions as an NP and is best glossed 'what sort (of thing)?' Both mise and its
dialectal equivalent taka are abstract, semantically ""light"" nouns meaning 'way,
manner, nature, kind (of thing)', and require additional modification to have real
semantic substance.
     The NP function of mise foo is illustrated in (305). Note that as a simple NP, it
may be subject or nonsubject in the core clause, resulting in subject focus (305a) and
nonsubject focus (305b) constructions, respectively.(305)    a. mise       foo    nga ci humbar di            taka   di

            'Do you put it (=melon) in something? Or what kind of thing do you
             do to it?'     (305a) is literally 'It is what manner (of thing) that is the (essential) manner of
the waterbag?' (mise and taka are near-synonyms).
     The instrumental type mise foo ... (nda) 'how?' is illustrated in (306a) with
stranded nda present, and in the less common type (306b) with nda omitted. Since the
fronted NP cannot be the subject of the core sentence, the nonsubject focus
construction is required.(306)    a.   [musa     foo]       na a-a           tiisa      ga     [nda \.]1
              [manner which?] Foe 3SgS-Impf make 3SgO [with f ] ?

              '[What way], [focus] do you(Pl) remove it [(with) tx]T
                  (= 'How do you remove it?')
182     8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization     maa se 'why?' ('what? Dat') has a somewhat ambiguous syntactic relationship to
the core of its clause. It is normally fronted like other WH-interrogatives representing
core relations like direct object. It can take the usual Focus morpheme na, as in
(307b), but most often this morpheme is absent, as in (307a). Moreover, a fronted
maa se (without na) may actually co-occur with an immediately following second
fronted constituent which does have a following na, as in (307c). (307c) suggests that
REASON as a thematic relation is, or at least can be, somewhat external to the core of
the clause and therefore outside of the framework of clause-internal focalization. The
two very different syntactic statuses of 'why?' in (307b) and (307c) make it difficult to
interpret the very common simple pattern (307a). One could interpret 'why?' in (307a)
as being focalized, the Focus morpheme na simply being omitted (always a
possibility with focalized PPs). Or one could interpret it as belonging to an outer
syntactic layer as in (307c).(307)     a.   [maa          se]      n         koyl

10.4 Sloppy (partial) coreferentiality""Sloppy"" coreferentiality or coindexation is present when two NPs denote,
respectively, a set and one of this set's proper subsets. Thus 'we' and T are in a
sloppy relationship, since the denotation of the former strictly contains that of the
latter (the denotion of T is a strict subset of the denotation of 'we'). The combination
of such sloppily coreferential NPs poses problems, since some grammatical
mechanisms are based on the coreferential-noncoreferential distinction. This applies to
reflexive constructions (antecedent is usually the clause-mate subject NP), logophoric
pronouns (antecedent is the quoted speaker), and relative clauses (antecedent is the head
NP).
     In the following sections, a subscripted index ""xy"" indicates that the denotation in
question strictly contains that represented by ""x"" or ""y,"" as in 'wexy' vis-a-vis Ίχ'.
     In theory, we should also consider cases involving the complex intersection of
two overlapping sets, e.g., 'theyxy' and 'theyyz', where only ""y"" is shared.

themxy' involving a subject NP whose denotation is a strict subset of that of a
postverbal possessor or postpositional complement. In such constructions, the
partially coindexed NP is expressed as SReflPl, as in (677). This construction is quite
common, cf. §4.1.3.(677)    a.   a       koy [ggi-ye         doo]
              3SgS go [3ReflPl at]

"     That baa 'want' has a special sense 'be about to' as serial verb is shown by
examples with inanimate subjects ('the wall wanted to [=was about to] collapse'). For
'want' plus a subjunctive complement clause, see §9.6.1.
     Next we have some serial verbs which specify that the core eventuality occurred
before the temporal reference point: bey 'know' ('have ever VP-ed'), faati 'have

                                               9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs     311      bey 'know' is used in experiential perfects, which nicely fits its basic sense. As a
serial verb it is most common in negatives (Ί have never ...') as in (591b), and
questions ('have you ever ...'), as in D's query in (591a). Note that H's response in
(59la) omits bey, just as 'ever' is omitted in the corresponding translation. The
translation 'have never' in (59 Ib) shows that the negation takes scope over the
experiential perfective ('it is not the case that [I have ever seen him]').
      faati 'pass' (<Ar.) is uncommon as a simple verb (cf. bisa 'pass'), but is more
common as a serial verb meaning 'already', as in (59Ic). A negative takes scope over
it, as in (591d), giving the sense 'not [... already]'. This is close to the sense 'not yet',
but the usual way to express this is negation plusjinaa 'first, for now', which is fact
is used in D's repetition of H's point in (591d).
      Serial verbs expressing habituality or iteration are oindi 'remain', dooney 'do
habitually', yee 'return', and fitta 'repeat'. In all cases the serial-verb use is closely
related to the core lexical sense. Examples are in (592a-h).(592)    a. ije-keyna       di^ o          oindi     [ka      jafa      yene]

            3SgS ImpfNeg can"" [Inf repeat [Inf eat]]
            'It (=donkey) can't eat any more.'
312     9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics     cindi 'remain' can be used with imperfective aspect, as in (592a), to indicate
present-time continuity. However, this serial verb is especially common with
unmarked (perfective) aspect, indicating past habitual ('used to'), dooney can often be
glossed 'be accustomed to', but as (592b) shows it need not have a sentient agent and
the most appropriate general gloss is 'do usually*.
     yee 'return' is semantically weak, and even in simple motion contexts it nearly
always combines with either Centripetal -kate in the sense 'come back' (§6.3.3), or
with another motion verb in a serial construction, like yee ka koy (592d). In the
more abstract sense 're-VP, VP again' with a non-motional substantive VP, we
generally get either filla 'repeat' by itself (592e-f,h) or a combination of yee and filla
in either order (592c,g). filla is notable in that it optionally omits the usual Inf ka
before the following substantive VP. ka is absent after filla in (592c,e,g), but present
in (592h). Both yee and filla combine easily with a negative in the sense 'not VP
again' or 'no longer VP'. In both positive and negative contexts, yee and filla are
often reinforced by the adverbial particle koyne 'again' (§1 1.1.5), as in (592c,e-f).
     duu 'get, earn' as serial verb is best glossed 'proceed to VP' or '(and) then VP'.
This hopefully captures the flavor of this combination, which indicates sequencing
after the previously described event but also adds a little extra foregrounding (593).(593)     a.   saa foo yo yer o             kani^ i     se hawey,               hal

"     A number of abstract uses of ga are natural extensions of On' and have parallels
with English on. The construction Υ goo [Xga], lit. Ύ be on X', is used for custody
or temporary possession (§5.9.5), cf. English / have five dollars on me. The examples
in (691) can also be translated with English On*. In (69la), the afflictions are a burden
put on people. In (69Ib), tea's original raison d'etre was to counter fatigue.(691)    a.    woo       yo kul i           har
              Dem        PI all 3P1S say

              Tea has nothing on which [focus] it was originally based except
               fatigue.'     ga is often translatable as Out of, from', for example with kow 'take out,
remove'. Recall that apparent ablative glosses of other postpositions like doo, ra, and
kuna turn out to be translation artifacts, and that the ablative element is really
attributable to a verb ('exit', 'leave', 'take out'). Consider (692).(692)         no-o         musey ga
              2SgS-Impf rub         3SgO

              'You rub it (melon seeds) until it (=this) removes the dirt from it.'
358     11 Semantic topics    The ga in question is of course the postposition in a ga, not the 3SgO clitic.
Since kow 'take out, remove' has a built-in ablative component, it is possible to take
ga here as locative On', cf. 'there is some dirt on the melon seeds.'
    ga is apparently glossable as 'by' in connection with the verb bisa 'pass' (693a),
and as 'in' or 'into' in (693b).(693)      a. no-o         bisa [a        ga] ni   si bey
              2SgS-Impf pass [3Sg by] 2SgS ImpfNeg know

1.3 Format of grammarThe present grammar of KCh is written in a fairly strict format to facilitate
comparison to the appendices and to my forthcoming parallel descriptions of other
Songhay languages. The numbering of chapters and sections thereof will be held
constant to the extent possible, although this means that in each grammar some
subsections are blank (e.g., ""tonology"" in the present grammar). In Appendix 1 on the
""upriver"" (Goundarm, Niafunke) varieties, and to a lesser extent in Appendix 2 on
DjCh, we disregard areas where their grammars do not differ significantly from that of
Timbuktu KCh (perhaps giving an example or two), reserving extended analysis for
areas where they differ from Timbuktu.
     The format of the grammar is not revolutionary, and its general nature can be
gleaned from a pass through the table of contents. We begin with a brief overview
chapter (2), designed to give readers an idea what a simple Songhay sentence looks
like. Fortunately, the language is simple morphologically and readers should be able to
pick up its basic sentence structure quickly. A brief chapter on phonology (3) leads to
two chapters (4, 5) on nominal constructions, the first focusing on derivational
processes (also including information on personal and demonstrative pronouns), the
second describing NP inflection and phrasal syntax.
     Verbs likewise get two chapters (6, 7), one mainly on voice categories expressed
by suffixation (or by zero), the other on mood-aspect-negation (MAN) inflection and
VP structure.
     The next chapter (8) turns to ""information packaging"" issues such as focus, topic,
and relativization. These are all of great importance in Songhay discourse, and it turns
out that there are important differences among the Songhay varieties in the respective
forms and functions. This is followed by a chapter (9) on complex (interclausal)
syntax, in which various types of ""serial verb"" construction play important roles. The
final grammatical chapter (10) is on anaphora; the most significant topic here is the
use of logophoric and reflexive versus ordinary personal pronouns.
     The last chapter (11) looks at selected lexical semantic matters, including the
lexical division of labor in expressing spatiotemporal concepts, and some
ethnosemantic issues such as kinship and emotion terminology.
     A volume of Texts in Koyra Chiini (Songhay of Timbuktu) is in press with
Koppe Verlag, Cologne. It includes texts from Timbuktu, Niafunke (an ""upriver""
dialect), and Djenne. A set of three Songhay-English-French dictionaries is to be
published by rHarmattan, Paris. One of the three is KCh (Timbuktu to Niafunke), and
another is for DjCh (the third is KS of Gao).
6     1 Introductionl .4 Transcriptional conventionsKCh is quite simple morphologically and there are few productive phonological rules
disguising underlying (lexical) phonological representations. Double slashes // ... //
enclose underlying representations (not italicized). In the grammar text, brackets [ ... ]
enclose phonetic representations. The ordinary phonemic transcription is italicized
without slashes or brackets. We use the hyphen ""-"" as a morpheme boundary in a fairly
restricted set of cases where it seems justified. Examples are verb stems containing a
derivational suffix (Fact-Caus or Mediop -ndi), such as dira-ndi 'cause to walk'.
     It has been difficult to decide whether to use hyphens in noun-noun compounds,
noun-adjective combinations, and similar close-knit stem sequences showing various
degrees of lexicalization. There is no consistent phonological test for lexicalization of
such combinations, and other criteria (frequency, semantic specialization) are gradient
rather than categorical. In general, I use hyphens in compounds sparingly (when the
combination seems fairly clearly lexicalized), and in combinations involving high-
frequency finals such as -ije 'child' and -fiaa 'mother'. However, readers should not put
too much stock in these transcriptional decisions.
     My most idiosyncratic transcriptional decision is to use the subscripted ligature
""^"" to indicate assimilations across word or morpheme boundaries. This enables us to
show the basic forms of the morphemes in question, maintaining the transparency of
the morpheme structure, while at the same time at least hinting at the surface
pronunciation.
     In the case of nasal consonants, a ligature indicates point-of-articulation
assimilation to a following segment, generally n —> [η] before velar stop. The
expected parallel shifty—> [n] before alveolar consonant is moot in Timbuktu KCh,
where lexical stem-final η is normally absent, but occurs in upriver KCh dialects
which allow stem-final η.","[21, 22]"
"
7.2.2 Perfective and imperfectiveThe basic Impf morpheme is ο ~ go. By far the predominant form in Timbuktu is o.
The Impf morpheme follows the subject and is followed by the verb; the only
morpheme which may intervene between Impf and the verb is Future ta (§7.2.5).
Since all pronouns, NP-final grammatical morphemes (e.g. Def di or PI yo), and SFoc
gga end in a vowel, as do many noun stems, o usually undergoes VV-Contraction. In
the case of pronouns, some of the contractions are irregular, see (35) in (§3.7.1).
     The combination of Impf plus Neg is expressed by the portmanteau morpheme si,
glossed ImpfNeg (§7.2.1). The imperfective-perfective opposition is neutralized in the
subjunctive mood (§7.2.4), and with identificational quasi-verb nono (§7.1.1). It is
only unreliably expressed with equational ci 'be' (§7.1.1).
     There are two situations where ο - go is replaced by goo, and ImpfNeg si by sii.
The first situation is in truncated replies to yes-no questions (§8.2.1). The second
situation, in our preferred analysis, is locational predications of the type 'be (in a
place)', where we get apparent quasi-verbs goo and sii (§7.1.2).
     There is no true tense marking in KCh. However, the basic aspect categories,
perfective (unmarked) and imperfective (o - go), have temporal as well as aspectual
implications. We first consider ordinary sentences (without complementizers or special
serial verbs), then discuss aspectual usage in specialized syntactic constructions. We
focus first on action and process verbs, returning below to verbs of adjectival quality,
which have special features.
     In both hypothetical and counterfactual conditionals, the antecedent ('if ...') clause
is most often perfective, though it may be imperfective under limited conditions. The
consequent clause is always imperfective. Since the antecedent may contain more than
one clause, the perfective-to-imperfective transition is often a crucial clue in
identifying the break between antecedent and consequent (§9.5.1).
     In ordinary past-tense narratives, perfective and imperfective may alternate in the
fashion familiar from many languages. Perfective is associated with abrupt or
otherwise bounded events of the sort that are usually foregrounded in narrative.
Imperfective applies prototypically to prolonged, incomplete or otherwise unbounded
situations or processes of the sort commonly used in narrative as backgrounds, their
temporal intervals encompassing those of superimposed foregrounded events. Consider
(252).

position. It is also yo when immediately followed by the quantifier kul 'all', as in
boro di yo kul 'all the people'.
      However, in some other combinations the yo is usually unrounded to ye ~ ya. (It
is difficult to distinguish a from e after y in unstressed grammatical morphemes.) This
unrounding is normal before Dat and spatial postpositions se, ra, kuna, and doo.
Examples: boro di ye ra 'in the people', boro di ye se 'for the people' (dative).
Note that the quality of the postposition vowel seems to play no role here; the process
is best seen as a relaxation of the secondary labial articulation, influenced both by the
preceding palatoalveolar y and by the lack of phonetic stress in these positions. It
appears that phrase-final (and especially prepausal) position is too ""exposed"" to permit
this relaxation.
      The unrounding can also occur when the plural noun is followed without pause by
another grammatical morpheme such as Rel kaa and SFoc nga. Thus boro di ya kaa
... 'the people who ...', boro di ya nga kar ga 'it was the people [focus] who hit
him.'
      A similar unrounding is very common in the 3P1F pronoun rjgi-yo and the
(sometimes homophonous) Logo/3ReflPl pronoun ngu-yo~ ngi-yo (see §4.1.4). The
rounded vowel is heard phrase-finally, as in the logophoric example i har [ay kar
ngi-yo] 'theyxy said that [I hit themxy].' Such phrase-final position is possible when the
pronoun in question is a simple direct object, or when it occurs in isolation. In all
other uses (subject, focused NP, dative or other postpositional object, possessor) the
pronoun is immediately followed by other material. In this situation, at least in
Timbuktu KCh, the -yo tends strongly to be pronounced [ja] (or [je], the two being
hard to discriminate in rapid speech). A possessor example is ngi-ya harme di 'their
(LogoPl or 3ReflPl) brother'.",[60]
