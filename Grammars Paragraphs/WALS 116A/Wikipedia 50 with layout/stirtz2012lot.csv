non-verbal or verbal question clauses. This section discusses how it is used in non-
verbal questions and section 15.3 presents its use in verbal questions. Question
clauses have the same construction as equivalent declarative clauses except for the
question marker.",[295]

question marker à is independent from stems, evidenced by lack of [ATR] quality
change in the question marker in (44b).

Agented passive, passive, antipassive, and causative morphemes are syntactically
distinguished in a section on verbal valency. Non-verbal clauses with two sets of
copulas are compared. Relative clauses, noun phrase agreement, and possession are
also discussed, among other grammatical aspects. Chapter 15 presents sentence-

Only the interrogative pronouns of (6b-e) agree in number with the noun phrase
which they replace. Some interrogative pronouns have a marked form when they
replace words which occur in an uncommon position in the clause, but are otherwise
unmarked. Other interrogative pronouns only have one form regardless of its
position in the clause. When any of the interrogative pronouns are pre-verbal, the
clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO) of 7.7 and 8.3.8 attaches sentence-finally.
When an interrogative pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal, the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) of 10.7 is attached to the verb.","[311, 312]"

and accompaniment clitic =nĒ attached to underlying approximants and long
vowel-final stems. In all noun words, tone assignment takes the stem tone as its

Gaahmg (Gaam, enthologue code [tbi]) is a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic language
spoken in the Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province of North Sudan, near the
Ethiopian border. For centuries, the Gaahmg people have fought off invaders
entering their hills. Even today, their culture and language have been less influenced
by outsiders than those of other ethnic groups in the Blue Nile Province. Although
Gaahmg speakers outnumber speakers of other languages in the area, little
documentation has been done of their language. This work presents a description of
Gaahmg grammar, including its phonology, morphology, and syntax.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"Alternatively, one might analyze the nouns of (15) and (17) as having suffixes in the
singular and plural forms and the roots ending in vowels, such as d̪āɔ̀-d̪/ d̪āɔ̀-ðàgg
‘fertile soil’, àbbā-d̪/ àbbā-āgg ‘tree type’, bìmìrí-ɟɟ/ bìmìrí-īgg ‘bird type’, etc.
However, this analysis requires an additional singular suffix -ɟɟ and plural suffix
-ðAgg, the latter being unusual in that there are no other -CVC suffixes on nouns.
Further, when the vowel-initial past continuous suffix -An is attached to the vowel-
final verb root /pa/ ‘guard’, the suffix becomes a second syllable, juxtaposed to the
root (pā.-án), in accordance with {M2} of 3.1. However, the plural suffix on the
nouns in (15) and (17) does not become an additional syllable (bìmìrí-īgg), and
reflects a different underlying form. Thus, the alternative analysis is not taken and
the nouns of (15) and (17) are analyzed as having only plural suffixes.",[105]
"Alternatively, the nouns of (19) could have root-final vowels. But as with the nouns
of (15) and (17), the plural suffix on the nouns of (19) does not become an additional
syllable, juxtaposed to the root (áŋɛ́.-ɛ̄gg ‘elephant’) as does the past continuous
suffix on verbs with root-final vowels (pā.-án ‘guard-CONT.P’) {M2}. Thus, the
alternative analysis is not taken.",[106]
"In this thesis, word-initial plosives are written as voiceless plosives since they
surface as such. Underlying geminate plosives in word-final and intervocalic4
  Or, since consonant clusters are not attested word-initially, an alternative analysis would be
that geminate plosives are fortis (‘strong’) consonants and non-geminate plosives are lenis
(‘weak’) consonants.
28                                A grammar of Gaahmgposition are written as voiced geminate plosives, and the reader should assume that
all such voiced geminate plosives surface with little or no contrastive length.","[28, 29]"
"Subjunctive verbs add the suffix -d̪A to the root, except in first and second singular
person forms, where other suffixes can sometimes be added depending on the root-
final segments. A subject pronoun with Mid tone introduces the subjunctive verb.
Plural pronouns before such verbs do not have the plural marker -gg, and second
person pronouns are optionally [+/- ATR] regardless of the [ATR] quality of the root
vowel. The subjunctive particle ā is an optional alternative for introducing third
person subjunctive verbs, as shown in (14b,c).",[182]

preceding verb, verb predicate or clause. Since neither its position nor function
differs from adverbs, the negative particle can also be analyzed as an adverb. As in
(14a), the negative particle occurs as the last word of the verb phrase and may be
separated from the verb by verb complements or adjuncts. The negative particle
may also negate an adverb of manner as in (b) or a prepositional phrase functioning
as an adverb as in (c).",[280]

14.1      Introduction
In the previous chapters, various morphemes have been shown to be distinct in form.
We now present many of the same morphemes in their syntactic context to show
their function. Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb
forms are shown to be syntactically distinct. In non-verbal clauses, copular clitics
are shown to take the place of separate copula particles, which are functionally
equivalent but different in form. Relative clauses are morphologically marked for
definiteness and grammatical function, and they receive the marking instead of the
head noun they modify.","[280, 281, 282]"
"The original data set of nouns and verbs were taken from word lists entered into
dictionary software by speakers of the language, which became the Gaahmg-English
Dictionary (Madal 2004). The singular and plural forms of nouns and subjunctive
and completive forms of verbs were written on cards and glossed in English and
Arabic. The cards were sorted numerous times to isolate segments and tone in the
same environments, and each time speakers read the words on the cards.",[19]

The following is a summary of the thesis in Dutch. See section 1.4 for an overview
in English.","[348, 349, 350]"

actions are described using either the incompletive or continuous, the continuous
form being the more common. For some verbs, such as ‘sleep’, there is more than
one form possible to describe habitual action: nāa (incompletive) and nāan
(continuous). For other verbs, the choice of incompletive or continuous form for
habitual action is based on the semantics of the verb. More study is needed to
determine semantic groupings that predict the correct habitual verb form.",[190]
"6. There are five case suffixes in Laarim (Surmic) which have polar tone—opposite
   tone from the stem-final tone.",[353]
"The lengthening rule of {P4} requires that the minimal surface word for nouns and
verbs have at least mid syllable weight. The process does not apply to other parts of
speech such as the negative wá ‘no, not’ or the adverb tu̪ ‘towards, upward’. These
adverbs, which are separate words, are discussed in chapter 13.",[41]
"14.6 Non-verbal clausesThere are two sets of copulas with which all non-verbal clauses are formed. The
most common set of copulas are shown in table 57 and are used for adjectival,
possessive, and equative clauses. A second set is used for locative and
presentational clauses, which will be presented shortly. With the limited data
collected, it could not be determined how existential clauses, if possible, are
constructed.",[290]
"6.2.1       Singular suffixesLess than 5% of noun lexemes in the language24 have singular suffixes. Although
there are five attested singular suffixes, only -d̪ is not rare. All singular suffixes
attach to root-final sonorants, and the suffix -d̪ also attaches to root-final vowels.
The choice of the singular suffix has no semantic correlation with the noun to which
it is attached. Virtually all nouns with singular suffixes also have plural suffixes.
The plural suffixes attached to nouns presented in this section are the same as those
presented in the following sections.",[98]

semantics. As for phonological conditioning, -AAd̪ attaches to nouns whose stem
ends in gg. The plural suffix -Agg in (13) which attaches to root-final bb, d̪, d, ɟɟ
and g, cannot be used with such nouns. In addition, there are five nouns not ending
in gg which take -AAd̪, four of which are kinship terms. There are many other
kinship terms which do not have the suffix -AAd̪. Only the ten nouns of (23) have
been attested with this suffix. Since the suffix vowel is underlyingly specified as
[-round], it is not affected by the [round] quality of the root.",[108]

1.2    Gaahmg land, history, and peopleThe Ingessana Hills are southwest of Damazine and northwest of Kurmuk in the
Blue Nile Province. The capital of the Ingessena area is Bao (11.350797,
34.083710) and the government offices are in Soda. There are reported to be 78
hills in the area, some rising 300 meters above the surrounding flat plains. While the
plains are grassland with occasional acacia trees, the vegetation in the hills has a
much greater variety of plants and trees, with water sources even in the dry season.

groups in the surrounding geo-political area known as the Funj. In addition to the
related languages of the Aka, Molo, Kelo, and Ben Sheko, there are the Berta,
Gumuz, Oromo to the east, the Burun, Jumjum, Uduk, Mabaan to the south, Dinka

process occurs syllable-finally before a consonant-initial suffix, provided that the
underlying root-final consonant is not the same as the suffix-initial consonant. In

vowel as in ɲáɔ́-d̪ɔ ́ ‘request’ is further support of the root-final segment weakening
to a vowel. Similarly, in the first singular forms of (f-g), w becomes ɔ (ɲáɔ́-nɔ́
‘request’), and y becomes ɛ (kɔ́ɛ-́ nɔ́ ‘cook’) before the consonant-initial suffix -n(A).

This thesis investigates the grammar of Gaahmg, a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic
language spoken in the Blue Nile Province of North Sudan. The comprehensive
description provides an analysis of the phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Ten texts of various genre are given to help illustrated the grammar in context.",[1]
"In the third singular forms of (41), High tone is assigned to the end of the continuous
suffix -A᷄n (MH), which already has final High tone. In (c,d,f), the initial Mid tone
of the suffix -A᷄n assimilates to the preceding Low tone {M9}. In (d), the resulting
H-LH becomes H-MH {M10} when the third singular object =E᷇ with HM tone is
attached, and in (f), the underlying tone surfaces unchanged when the third singular
object is attached.

suffix to become -A᷄ ǹ (MHL). In (c,d,f), the initial Mid tone of the suffix -A᷄ ǹ
assimilates to the preceding Low {M9}. In (d), the resulting H-LHL tone becomes
H-LML in accordance with the combination rule {M11} in 3.4.4, or the tone
becomes H-MHL {M10} when the third singular object clitic =E with no
underlying tone is attached. In (f), the LHL tone also becomes LML {M11}, or the
underlying tone surfaces unchanged when the third singular object is attached.","[198, 199]"
