19.2.1. Polar interrogativesPolar interrogatives express questions that can be answered by ‘yes’ or ‘no’,
although other answers are possible as well, such as ‘maybe’ or ‘I don’t know’.
However, ‘no’ answers are not defining of polar questions in Toqabaqita, be-
cause questions asked by means of open interrogatives also can be answered
with ‘no’. It is ‘yes’ and ‘maybe’ answers that are unique to polar questions.
(See section 19.4 for answers to questions.)
                                                  19.2 Closed interrogatives   791   The structure of polar interrogatives is no different from the structure of
(simple) declarative sentences. The only difference is in the intonation. While
in declaratives there is normally a fall in intonation towards the end of the sen-
tence, in polar interrogatives there is a rise in intonation towards the end. The
sentence in (19-1) with falling intonation at the end is declarative, while struc-
turaly identical (19-2) with a rise in intonation at the end is interrogative:(19-1)     Qe             qako       naqa.
           3SG.NFUT be.cooked PRF
           ‘It [food] is cooked/done now.’(19-2)     Qe            qako       naqa?
           3SG.NFUT be.cooked PRF
           ‘Is it cooked/done now?’   Polar interrogatives can be elliptical sentence fragments:(19-3)     Qa-muqa?
           POSS-2SG.PERS
           ‘Yours?’ (Asking about food.)   A polar interrogative may contain a topicalized, fronted element:(19-4)     Wela baa ki,       qo          riki-da?
           child that PL      2SG.NFUT see-3PL.OBJ
           ‘The children, did you see them?’    A polar interrogative can be joined with a non-interrogative clause in a com-
plex sentence. In (19-5) the interrogative clause is coordinated with a declara-
tive clause :(19-5)     Nau ku            lae naqa, ma ni                    kamuluqa?
           1SG 1SG.NFUT go         PRF and PROFORE              2PL
           ‘I am going now, and (how about) you?’   And in (19-6) the interrogative clause forms the apodosis of a conditional
sentence:(19-6)     Mada      sa    mika          fula         qi     qusungadi,
           or        IRR   1PL(EXCL).SEQ arrive       LOC    tomorrow
792      Interrogatives
             ka        leqa    ba-na?
             3SG.SEQ be.good LIM-3SG.PERS
             ‘If we come tomorrow, will that be all right? (lit.: will that only be
             good?)’ ‘If we came tomorrow, would that be good?’    Without any formal difference, positive polar interrogatives may express
neutral questions, where the speaker has no particular expectations about
whether the answer will be positive or negative, or they can express biased
questions, where the speaker has an expectation that the answer will be posi-
tive. The question expressed in (19-7) is neutral:(19-7)       Qo          riki-a        faela baa?
             2SG.NFUT see-3.OBJ file that
             ‘Have you seen the file [a tool]?’    On the other hand, the question expressed in (19-8) is biased. The question
is directed at a person who is getting ready to leave. The speaker expects the
answer to be positive and seeks confirmation:(19-8)       Qoki     lae naqa neri?
             2SG.FUT go     PRF NPAST.HERE
             ‘Are you going now?’    Sometimes the speaker is fully certain that the state of affairs is indeed such
and such and is seeking neither information nor confirmation. Rather a positive
polar interrogative serves a phatic communion function. Quite commonly, peo-
ple when seeing that a state of affairs is such and such will use a polar inter-
rogative as if they were inquiring about that state of affairs. Such interrogatives
typically serve as a way to initiate conversation or as a greeting. The sentence
in (19-9) was addressed to a man who was clearly making copra:(19-9)       Qo         kafara            nena?
             2SG.NFUT make.copra          NPAST.THERE
             ‘Are you making copra?’   And the interrogative in (19-10) was addressed to a person who was passing
by on his way down (towards the coast) and was intended as a greeting:(19-10)      Qo          sifo    nena?
             2SG.NFUT descend NPAST.THERE
             ‘Are you going down?’
                                                  19.2 Closed interrogatives   793    Positive polar interrogatives are also used when the speaker is not seeking
information from the addressee because he/she does not expect the addressee to
have the information. Rather, the speaker is contemplating the possibility that
such and such may be the case or is wondering whether such and such might be
the case. Such interrogatives function to express a relatively high degree of
uncertainty on the part of the speaker about a state of affairs. They employ the
element mada ‘or’, which elsewhere functions as a conjunction and also to
introduce the protases of conditional sentences, and they may also contain the
particle toqo ‘perhaps’, ‘probably’, ‘possibly’ (section 18.5.1). In (19-11) toqo
is present:(19-11)    Mada     e           sifo      toqo?
           or       3SG.NFUT descend perhaps
           ‘Did he perhaps go down [to the coast]?’   For a pair of examples without toqo see (18-60a) and (18-60b) in section
18.5.3.
   In contrast to positive polar interrogatives, negative polar interrogatives are
normally used to seek confirmation. A negative state of affairs is unexpected or
unusual, and the speaker wishes to have it confirmed that the situation is indeed
such and such. For example, on arriving at a household in the morning and not
seeing Ulufaalu (a man) around, the person surmises that Ulufaalu is still asleep
and asks:(19-12)    Ulufaalu     qe=aqi        si      tharaqi?
           Ulufaalu     3SG.NFUT=NEGV 3SG.NEG be.awake
           ‘Ulufaalu is not awake?’   By saying (19-13), the speaker expresses her surprise at not seeing Fiona
and the others around:(19-13)    Fiona kesi         fula     quu?
           Fiona    3PL.NEG arrive     ANTCONT
           ‘Haven’t Fiona ’n them arrived yet?’
19.2.2. Alternative interrogativesAlternative interrogatives express questions that “provide a list from which, the
speaker suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:
179). In Toqabaqita, the alternatives in such a list are joined by means of the
conjunction mada ‘or’ (sections 11.2.2 and 28.4). There is normally a fall in
794    Interrogatives
intonation at the end of an alternative interrogative. The alternatives may be
clausal, where it is clauses that are joined by mada, or subclausal, where clause
constituents are joined rather than whole clauses. In the first example below the
alternatives are expressed in noun phrases:(19-14)    Qo         thathami-a alo mada kai?
           2SG.NFUT want-3.OBJ taro or        yam
           ‘Do you want the taro or the yam?’    As far as clausal alternatives are concerned, two main subtypes can be dis-
tinguished. In one, the clauses encode independent alternative propositions,
while in the other type the proposition of the second clause is a negation of the
proposition of the first clause. The subtype with independent alternatives is
illustrated in (19-15):(19-15)    Qo         raa mada        qoki      biinga        ba-muqa?
           2SG.NFUT work or           2SG.IPFV sleep          LIM-2SG.PERS
           ‘Did you work or were you just asleep?’   If the second alternative is a negation of the first one, that alternative is nor-
mally expressed only by means of the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the
case’ (section 17.3):(19-16)    Faka ba=e              fula       mad=e            aqi?
           ship that=3SG.NFUT arrive         or=3SG.NFUT      not.be.so
           ‘Did the ship arrive or not?’   If the second alternative is assumed by the speaker to be obvious, it need not
be expressed at all, but the conjunction mada ‘or’ is still present. In fact, it is
the presence of mada that implies the existence of an alternative.","[843, 844, 845, 846, 847]"

19.4.   Answers to questions19.4.1. Answers to polar questionsWith respect to polar questions, Toqabaqita has an agree/disagree answer sys-
tem, sometimes in combination with an echo system (Sadock and Zwicky
1985). A positive (agree) answer pro-sentence element is used when the polar-
ity of the answer agrees with the polarity of the question, and a negative con-
struction is used when the polarity of the answer disagrees with the polarity of
the question. In a pure echo system, “… no special answer words are used at
all. Simple positive and negative responses to questions involve repeating the
verb of the question, with or without additional material ....” (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985: 191). In Toqabaqita, pro-sentence answer elements are some-
times combined with echo answers; alternatively, an echo answer may occur by
itself, without a pro-sentence element.
    There are four “agree” pro-sentence lexemes and one “disagree” type con-
struction. For convenience, the agree lexemes are glossed ‘yes’ and the disagree
construction is glossed ‘no’, ‘(it is) not’, but these glosses do not fully corre-
spond to the meanings of yes and no (because the English system is not of the
agree/disagree type). The gloss ‘yes’ will be in double quotes (“yes”) when the
agree elements occur in sentences that are answers to negative-polarity ques-
tions. The agree elements are listed in (19-149):(19-149)   agree pro-sentence lexemes: iu, aqaa, mania, uaqa   Of these, iu and aqaa are most common, with iu somewhat more common
than aqaa, while uaqa is least common. (All four all also used to express ac-
knowledgement with what somebody else is saying, and iu, aqaa and mania are
also used to link sentences; see examples [27-55] and [27-56] in section
27.3.2.)
   The disagree construction consists of the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be
the case’ (section 17.3) with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker.
The subject marker and the verb normally form one phonological word, with
the stress falling on the subject marker (section 2.5).

                                     ‘no’, ‘it is not so’, ‘it is not the case’   However, as will be discussed further below, the disagree construction is
used only in replies to positive-polarity questions.
   Answers to positive-polarity questions are discussed and illustrated first. In
the next set of examples, the first four illustrate the four agree lexemes:(19-151)   A: Qo           alu-a      ta   malefo?

addition to the pro-sentence elements or in addition to the negative construc-
tion, echoes of the interrogatives, with the appropriate adjustments in pronouns
and other deictic elements, and possibly with some additional material.","[881, 882, 883, 884]"

           B: ‘I am hungry.’   Of course, responses to polar questions are not restricted to agree-type or
disagree-type answers. For example, the respondent may not know the answer:(19-166)   A: Qoki    lae      qana uusi-a qi   qusungadi?
              2SG.FUT go       GENP buy-DVN LOC tomorrow           B: Botaena kwa         lae, mada ka         aqi.

19.4.2. Answers to alternative questionsThe default answer to an alternative question picks up one of the alternatives.
The interrogative sentence in (19-168) is a “complex” one (section 19.5), ex-
pressing a polar question (‘did you go?’) followed by an alternative one where
the second alternative is a negation of the first alternative (‘did you bring a
possum or not?’). The answer is an agree-type echo to the polar question and it
picks the negative alternative:(19-168)   A: Qoo, koqo        kera, kamaroqa     moro         laa-lae,

addressed to not know the answer or to not be certain about what the relevant
state of affairs is:(19-169)   A: Faka ba=e          fula            mad=e          aqi?

              alive’.)
           B: ‘He is around.’    Replies to negative-polarity polar questions are discussed next. In sentences
that are replies to negative-polarity questions, echoing of the interrogative is
more common than in sentences that are replies to positive-polarity questions,
especially when the reply is of the disagree type. When the reply is of the agree
type, an agree element may occur by itself, or an echo may occur by itself, or an
agree element and an echo may be combined. In (19-162) only an agree lexeme
is used.
                                                  19.4 Answers to questions   833(19-162)   A: Ulufaalu     qe=aqi        si      tharaqi?
              Ulufaalu     3SG.NFUT=NEGV 3SG.NEG be.awake              B: Aqaa.
                 “yes”
              A: ‘Ulufaalu is not awake?’
              B: ‘No (he is not awake).’    When a sentence that is a reply to a negative-polarity polar question con-
tains an echo, the echo is grammatically negative, as is the question. The echo
is grammatically negative not because the answer is of the disagree type but
because it is an echo of a negative interrogative. A negative echo and an agree
pro-sentence element can cooccur, as in (19-163):(19-163)   A: Qosi         rongo-a?
              2SG.NEG      hear-3SG.OBJ           B: Iu,       qe=aqi        kwasi              rongo-a.

           A: ‘Didn’t you hear it?’
           B: ‘No, I didn’t hear it.’   In (19-164) only the echo is present:(19-164)   A: Qosi         thaofa?
              2SG.NEG      be.hungry           B: Nau kwasi       thaofa.

           A: ‘Are you not hungry?’
           B: ‘(No,) I am not hungry.’   To express disagree-type replies to negative-polarity questions, only positive
echo-type answers are used. The disagree construction qe aqi is not used, with
or without an echo.","[884, 885, 886]"

           A: ‘Where did you go?’
           B: ‘Nowhere.’ (Lit.: ‘There was not [any such place].’)(19-174)   A: Taa n=o                    qani-a?

              3SG.NFUT=not.exist ASRT
           A: ‘What are you eating?’
           B: ‘Nothing.’ (Lit.: ‘There is not [any such thing].’)   That is, the same negative construction can be used to express a disagree-
type answer to an open question and as a negative answer to a polar question.
The only difference is that in responses to polar questions the negative verb has
the sense ‘not be so, not be the case’, while in responses to open questions the
negative verb has the negative existential sense ‘not exist’. (Negative existential
sentences are discussed 26.1.2.2.) The fact that in responses to open questions
the negative verb functions as an existential one can be seen from (19-175a),
where the verb occurs in the predicate position of a negative existential sen-
tence with an overt subject phrase. In (19-175b) only the verb occurs with the
subject marker and the assertive marker:(19-175)   a.     A: Taa       n=o                 thathami-a?

phrase that provides additional information:

19.5.    Complex interrogativesThe term “complex interrogatives” is used here to refer to cases where two
different types of interrogative are combined in some way, by juxtaposition of
sentences, or by coordination or embedding of clauses. In such cases normally
only one of the interrogatives expresses a true question, that is a question to
which an answer is being sought.
    One type of complex interrogative consists of an open interrogative sentence
with the intransitive interrogative verb qufita ‘be how?’, ‘do what?’, ‘do how?’
(section 19.3.5), followed by a closed interrogative sentence. It is the closed
interrogative that expresses the question to which an answer is requested. The
qufita interrogative merely serves to introduce the closed interrogative. It con-
sists of the verb qufita and its subject marker, which is the third person singular
nonfuture one, qe:(19-178)    Qe             qufita? Koki         lae,      mada
            3SG.NFUT       be.how? DU(INCL).FUT go        or

           DU(INCL).FUT stay LIM-DU(INCL).PERS
           ‘So (how)? Shall we go or shall we (just) stay?’   A complex interrogative structure may consist of what otherwise would be
an open interrogative followed by a fragment of an alternative interrogative that
narrows down the options of the former, and the answer is expected to be se-
lected from that set:(19-179)   Tei na   qoki    lae         bii-da,         kamiliqa  mada
           who? FOC 2SG.FUT go          COM-3PL.OBJ     1PL(EXCL) or           kini    qena      ki?

           ‘Which spoon of these two things is your spoon? This thing or that
           thing?’)   And a complex interrogative may consist of a dependent interrogative (sec-
tion 19.6) that is the complement of a higher verb, also in an interrogative
clause. In (19-181) the complement interrogative is of the closed, alternative
type, and in (19-182) of the open type. The complex interrogatives express
polar questions.","[891, 892]"

          A leave-taking formula, used especially to mean ‘Good night.’, but
          it can be used in leave-taking at any time of the day: ‘Good bye.’   Pro-sentence forms used in response or as a rejoinder to what has just been
said include iu, aqaa, mania, and uaqa. They are used as agree-type responses
to polar questions (section 19.4.1).

someone else is saying: ‘yes’, ‘hmm’, ‘aha’, ‘OK’, ‘right’:(27-55)    A: Kamareqa meki                 baqo-a         alinga-mu.

           B: ‘OK, that’s good.’   And they can also provide a loose link between the clause or sentence they
introduce and the preceding discourse: ‘OK’, ‘right’, ‘all right’. This kind of
linking function may also be performed by the form neri, which elsewhere
functions as a situational demonstrative adverb ‘nonpast here’ (section 13.7).
The first example below contains the pro-sentence form mania, and the second
one neri.","[1000, 1001]"
"
19.3.11.   Emphatic open interrogativesWith some exceptions, open questions can be made more emphatic, more insis-
tent by means of one of several intensifying particles, qana, feteqi, or boqo.
These particles occur inside the interrogative phrases. All three particles can
occur in interrogative noun phrases; qana can also occur in an adverb phrase
with fei ‘where?’. All three particles also occur in phrases other than interroga-
tive. For their positions in noun phrases see table 7.1 in section 7.1. The parti-
cles may be joined to the head interrogative word by means of the ligature ni,
although this is not very common.
    In emphatic questions with any of these particles, the interrogative phrase is
always in the focus position. Since the interrogative verbs qufita ‘be how?’, ‘do
what?’, ‘do how?’ and qufita-a ‘do what? to/with (st.)’, ‘do st. how?’ cannot be
fronted (section 19.3.5), the emphatic particles are not available with them. Nor
are they used in the inverted [verb.phrase subject] structure (sections 19.3.7
and 19.3.8), because the verb phrase is not in focus.
    The three particles may serve to highlight the kind of information requested;
to insist on an accurate, detailed or elaborate answer; to emphatically demand
an answer; or more generally to express some kind of emotional involvement
on the part of the speaker.
    Of the three particles, qana is the most common one in interrogatives. Four
examples follow.",[880]
"
7.10.     Qana intensifierThe intensifier qana is used primarily in interrogative noun phrases in open
interrogatives. Its function is to make a question more emphatic, more insistent,
to request a more accurate, detailed, elaborate answer. Emphatic open inter-

           ‘No cargo at all arrived; (it was) just lies [what certain people had

the exhaustive marker sui) are strong, not just that his hands are strong:(5-112)    Wane        roo     qaba nia    ki qe             suukwaqi

positive clause. In the first, negative clause, boqo has the whole clause in its
scope. (For negative answers to open questions see section 19.4.3.)(5-113)    A: Qo               lae   mai   bi=ni                tei?

Tense and aspect
The categories treated in this chapter are those of tense, aspect and the perfect,
the latter being neither purely a tense nor purely an aspect.","[709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 730]"

19.3.2. Fronting and non-fronting of interrogative phrases, and other properties
        of open interrogativesWith some exceptions, interrogative phrases may occur in situ, where the corre-
sponding non-interrogative phrase would occur in a declarative sentence, or
they can be fronted into the focus position (see [39-2] in section 39.1). In (19-
18) the interrogative phrase taa ‘what?’ occurs in situ, while in (19-19), it has
been fronted and is in focus. (The focus marker na and the subject marker have
fused as n=o).

           what? FOC=2SG.NFUT see-3SG.OBJ
           ‘What did you see?’    Similarly in the next pair of examples. In (19-20) the possessive interroga-
tive phrase is in situ, while in (19-21) it has been fronted and is in focus:(19-20)    Kera        kwaqi-a      rake=ni                   tei?
           3PL.NFUT cut-3.OBJ belly:3.PERS=PERSMKR who?

           ‘Whose belly did they cut (open)?’   Predicate interrogative noun phrases too can be fronted and focused:(19-22)    Tei na       wane lakoo?
           who? FOC man that(3)
           ‘Who is that man?’   Compare (19-23) with ‘who?’ in the predicate of a verbless sentence:(19-23)    Thata-mu          ni           tei?
           name-2SG.PERS PERSMKR who?
           ‘What is your name?’ (Lit.: ‘Your name is who?’)  See section 27.2.3 for grammatically positive verbless ascriptive sentences.
  Occasionally, a fronted interrogative phrase occurs without the focus
marker:(19-24)    Tei kera b=o           ngata          bii    kera qi
           who? 3PL that=2SG.NFUT speak          COM    3PL LOC           quuqusungadia?

           ‘Who (plural) did you speak with in the morning?’
                                                  19.3 Open interrogatives   797    For another example see (19-148) in section 19.3.11. This, however, is rare.
    The focus marker is sometimes absent when the interrogative phrase con-
tains the perfect marker naqa; see (19-114) in section 19.3.6. This is also the
case in non-interrogative clauses (section 39.2).
    The two options — fronting with focusing and no fronting — do not exist
for all types of open interrogatives. When they do, the type with the interroga-
tive phrase in in situ sometimes, but by no means always, expresses an echo
question in reaction to more or less immediately preceding linguistic context.
This type of question may be used when a person did not hear well part of what
has just been said and wants to have it repeated or elaborated upon. By using
the interrogative in (19-25) the person is asking his interlocutor to repeat who
he had spoken to, because he did not hear well what the interlocutor said:(19-25)    Qo         ngata    bii ni                 tei?
           2SG.NFUT speak      COM PERSMKR            who?
           ‘You spoke with who?’   Echo questions are also used because of the unexpectedness of what has just
been said, and the hearer wants to have it confirmed. In such cases the inter-
rogative word is usually uttered with greater-than-normal intensity, including a
sharp rise in intonation. This is indicated by bolding in the next example.","[848, 849, 850]"

the negative verb aqi ‘not exist’ with the third person singular nonfuture subject
marker. Quite commonly, the assertive particle boqo is present as well.","[888, 889]"

the object of a verb-like preposition and is fronted, the preposition must be
stranded behind, with one exception. Example (19-74) shows preposition
stranding:(19-74)    Taa      na    kera        qoga qani-a?
           what? FOC 3PL.NFUT be.busy GENP-3SG.OBJ
           ‘What are they busy with?’    Exceptionally, preposition-stranding need not take place when a taa phrase
is the complement of the purpose/reason verb-like preposition uri (section
10.3.2). The whole prepositional phrase may be fronted. There are three gram-
matical possibilities: fronting of the taa phrase alone; no fronting at all; and
fronting of the whole prepositional phrase. However, these options are not all
fully equivalent semantically. When only the taa phrase is fronted and the
preposition is stranded behind, the meaning expressed may be that of purpose
or cause/reason. The question may inquire about the identity of an object with
respect to which the event takes place, as in (19-75) below, or it may inquire
about the overall purpose of the event or about its cause/reason, as in (19-76)
and (19-77), respectively. However, the two different types of purpose are not
always clearly distinguishable. In the context of (19-75) the speaker assumes
that the third person had come to look for something, and the addressee identi-
fies the object:(19-75)    A: Taa       na         wane ba=e         laa-lae
              what?     FOC        man that=3SG.NFUT RDP-go              m=uri-a?

           A: ‘What did the man come for?’
           B: ‘He came for his knife that he left behind yesterday.’   In principle, the question in (19-75) could instead inquire about the overall
purpose of the man’s coming: ‘Why did the man come?’ On the other hand, the
sentence in (19-76) can only function as an inquiry about the purpose of the
overall event.

           ‘What did you “press” me for?’ ‘Why did you “press” me?’(Fele-si designates the action of one person gently and discretely pressing part
of another person’s body to attract their attention, for example, for a private
conversation.)
   The question in (19-77) is about the cause of, the reason for, the addressee’s
anger:(19-77)    Taa      n=o                rake-qiri      uri-a?
           what? FOC=2SG.NFUT          belly-be.angry REAS-3SG.OBJ
           ‘What are you angry about?’    The same range of meanings can be expressed with the taa phrase in situ.
Thus, (19-78) can be a purpose inquiry about a specific entity or about the over-
all event, while (19-79) expresses a question about the cause/reason.","[861, 862, 863]"

           ‘(Where is) the flashlight?’    For more examples see section 13.3.2.4.
    We can now consider interrogatives concerning locations that are not of the
locational-sentence type. There only fei is available as the interrogative word,
and usually, although not always, it is the complement of a preposition. The fei
phrase normally occurs in situ. The following prepositions can govern fei: loca-
tive qi, used for locations and locative goals; allative uri for locative goals; and
ablative fasi for locative sources. Being an adverb, fei is not indexed on the two
verb-like prepositions uri and fasi.
                                                      19.3 Open interrogatives   823   The first example expresses a question about a location:(19-125)   Qo          riki-a       loi         qeri qi  fei?
           2SG.NFUT see-3.OBJ snake             that LOC where?
           ‘Where did you see the snake?’   The sentences in (19-126) – (19-129) express questions about locative goals.
With some verbs, either the locative or the allative preposition is possible in the
interrogative phrase. For example:(19-126)   Koki          sifo     qi    fei?
           DU(INCL).FUT  descend LOC where?
           ‘Where should we go down to?’(19-127)   Kuki          thaka       uri        fei?
           PL(INCL).FUT  run.away ALL           where?
           ‘Where should we run away to?’    On the other hand, a given verb may require a certain preposition in its loca-
tive complements. For example, alu ‘put’ requires the general locative preposi-
tion qi:(19-128)   Qo         alu-a      naifa nau baa qi       fei?
           2SG.NFUT put-3.OBJ knife 1SG that LOC where?
           ‘Where did you put my knife?’ ‘Where did you put that knife of
           mine?’   With the verb lae ‘go’, it is relatively common for fei to occur neither with
the locative nor with the allative preposition:(19-129)   Thaina-mu       bia        maka      qoe     kera          lae
           mother-2SG.PERS and        father    2SG     3PL.NFUT      go           fei?
           where?
           ‘Where did your mother and father go?’    The sentence in (19-130) expresses a question about a locative source, and
fei occurs with the ablative preposition:

           2SG.NFUT go      VENT     ABL where?
           ‘Where did you come from?’    Interrogative locative prepositional phrases headed by the general locative
preposition qi can be fronted and focused, although this is relatively rare. Such
phrases can inquire about a location or about a locative goal. A prepositional
phrase with the locative pro-form ei must occur at the extraction site. Interroga-
tive prepositional phrases headed by the allative or the ablative preposition
cannot be fronted.","[875, 876, 877]"

uncertainty about the factual status of a proposition, or even complete lack of
knowledge with respect to a proposition. They occur clause-initially, unless
another element has been fronted, for example in topicalization. They can also
form utterances by themselves.
   Botaena and botaqana are mutually interchangeable, the former being
somewhat more common. In one function, they are often used in uncertain re-
plies to questions. If the reply is clausal with a verb, the verb takes the appro-
priate sequential subject marker.","[831, 832]"

Chapter 28
Coordination of clauses
28.1.   IntroductionCoordination of clauses can be syndetic or asyndetic. Three sets of coordinating
conjunctions can be distinguished in Toqabaqita on the basis of their functions:
conjunctive ma, bii, and bia, with some functional extensions in the case of ma;
disjunctive mada; and sui, sui mena and sui taa, whose core functions are to
express contrast and unexpectedness.
    When clauses are coordinated in any way, there is often a rise in intonation
at the end of each non-final clause and there may be a slight pause before the
next clause, and there is a fall in intonation at the end of the final clause, unless
that clause is a polar question, in which case there is a rise in intonation at the
end (section 19.2.1). Rise in intonation and pauses between clauses are indi-
cated by commas.
    Prosodically, the coordinators belong to the material to their right. The con-
junctions occur clause and sentence initially, except that they may be preceded
by an interjection or by an element that functions as a loose linker between that
sentence and the preceding discourse (‘OK, ‘right, ‘all right’; see examples (28-
21) and (28-22) in section 28.2.2.
    Syndetic coordination is discussed first; asyndetic coordination is discussed
in section 28.5
    Besides clausal coordination, linking of sentences is also discussed in this
chapter.","[1003, 1004, 1005]"

13.7.   The situational demonstrative adverbsThere are three demonstrative adverbs with a combined spatial/temporal-deictic
and a kind of emphatic-identifying function: neri, nena and nabaa. All three
are, historically at least, morphologically complex, but in present-day Toqa-
baqita they are best regarded as unitary. All three are fusions of the perfect-
aspect marker/intensifier naqa and the determiner demonstratives qeri, qena
and baa, respectively. Evidence for this will be provided later in this section. In
their deictic functions, the situational demonstratives have both temporal and
locative meaning.
    The situational demonstratives are clause-level constituents and occur clause
finally. The verb phrases in which they occur are never complements of prepo-
sitions. In declarative and imperative verbal clauses they identify, usually in a
slightly emphatic manner, the state of affairs expressed in the clause as indeed
being such and such. In questions they make the request for information slightly
more emphatic than would be the case otherwise.
640    The demonstratives and the demonstrative adverbs
    The choice among the three situational adverbs is determined partly by tem-
poral and partly by locative factors. There is a temporal contrast between neri
and nena on the one hand and nabaa on the other; and a locative contrast be-
tween neri and nena, defined primarily by the notion of the speaker’s sphere.
Neri and nena have non-past relevance, mostly the time of reference, but occa-
sionally also time after the time of reference. Nabaa has past relevance, before
the time of reference, with, usually implicit, reference to some specific time in
the past. The categories non-past and past have a relative significance: non-past
as not before the time of reference (which itself may be in the past), and past as
before the time of reference. (The determiner demonstrative qeri is used to
designate present time [section 13.3.2.1], and the determiner baa is used with
past-time reference [section 13.3.2.4].)
    As far as the contrast between neri and nena is concerned, neri identifies a
state of affairs as being within the speaker’s sphere, while nena identifies a
state of affairs as not being within the speaker’s sphere, often, but not necessar-
ily, in the addressee’s sphere. The speaker’s sphere is pragmatically unmarked:
a sphere is the speaker’s (identified so by means of neri), unless it is specifi-
cally identified (by means of nena) as not being so. This is illustrated with ex-
amples further below. The notion of the speaker’s sphere is not relevant to na-
baa. Nabaa is used about states of affairs located at a time before reference
time, regardless of whether or not they were in the speaker’s sphere.
    Neri, nena, and nabaa are glossed, respectively, ‘NPAST.HERE’,
‘NPAST.THERE’ and ‘PAST.THEN’. ‘THEN’ is equivalent to ‘at that time’, not to
‘later, afterwards’.
    The contrast between neri and nena is discussed and illustrated first. Sen-
tence (13-105) is about what the speaker is doing, and so it is neri that is used:(13-105)   Kwai         qani-a       keekene       neri.
           1SG.IPFV     eat-3.OBJ breadfruit NPAST.HERE
           ‘I am eating the breadfruit (that is what I am doing).’  In the next example, neri serves to emphasize that the person spoken about
was present at that time, because he had not been there earlier:(13-106)   Nia       kai          too         ba-n=i
           3SG       3SG.IPFV     be.at.place LIM-3SG.PERS=LOC           sa-ku           neri.
           ADJC-1SG.PERS NPAST.HERE
           ‘He is with me here now.’
                                   13.7 The situational demonstrative adverbs       641   Neri is used in a formulaic expression that serves to conclude an account of
something, such as at the end of a speech, a story, or a letter:(13-107)   Nia bo=naqa neri.
           3SG ASRT=PRF NPAST.HERE
           ‘That’s all (I have to say).’ ‘That’s it.’ ‘That’s the way it is/was.’   The sentence in (13-111) is a question about what the addressee is doing,
and so it is nena that is used:(13-108)   Qo         kafara           nena?
           2SG.NFUT make.copra         NPAST.THERE
           ‘Are you making copra (is that what you are doing)?’    In the next example, there is alternation between neri and nena. The person
first tells the addressee that she is waiting for him, and uses neri. After waiting
in vain for a while, she changes her mind, and tells the addressee to wait for
her; she will go over to him. And in that sentence she uses nena.","[668, 669, 670]"

AcknowledgementsFirst and foremost, my thanks go to Lawrence Foana’ota and Reuel Riianoa. I
first started working on the language with Lawrence in 1981, when he was a
student at the University of Auckland. And it was Lawrence who introduced me
to the late Reuel Riianoa of Laathalu Village, who became my primary lan-
guage consultant. Reuel was highly respected in the community for his knowl-
edge of the language and traditional concepts at a time when many of the tradi-
tional ways of life had disappeared or may disappear before long.
     A number of other people have contributed, over the years, to this grammar,
whether with texts or other kinds of data. Here I wish to thank Siufimama
(Lawrence’s late grandmother), John Kwanairara (Reuel’s late father), Adam
Ulufaalu Kwanairara (Reuel and his wife Rosina’s son), Reni, Olofia, Ellen
Kanatolea, Penuel Idusulia (the school principal at Malu’u, for general discus-
sions about the Toqabaqita language), Fred Saeni (with whom I worked on the
language during his visits to Auckland), Kado Kamanesi, Rosina Foialatha
(Reuel’s wife) and Liah Lifungangale (Lifuna) (Reuel and Rosina’s daughter)
for information about a disguised-speech variety known to some women, and to
Cathrine Saelifia (Adam Ulufaalu’s daughter) for demonstration of Pig-Latin
Toqabaqita used by children.
     My first period of field work in Toqabaqita was in December 1984–
February 1985. This was followed by five more periods, the last one being in
August–November 1999. During my stays in Laathalu Village I enjoyed the
hospitality and generosity of Reuel Riianoa and Rosina Foialatha’s extended
family, which includes the families of their son Adam Ulufaalu and his wife
Alice Edanamae, and their daughter Liah Lifungangale (Lifuna). On the coast,
at Malu’u, there was the always welcoming house of Reuel and Rosina’s other
daughter Joy Edarodo (Edata) and her husband Fred Matangani (Mata). On
various occasions I also enjoyed the company of Eddie Kanari, Kanatolea,
Saeni, David Rara, and many others. Lawrence Foana’ota was always a good
and helpful friend when I was in Honiara for brief periods of time.
     My work on the Toqabaqita language was supported by several grants from
the University of Auckland Research Fund, which are gratefully acknowledged.
     One round of revisions of the grammar was completed while I was an Hon-
orary Visiting Fellow at the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology at La
Trobe University, on research and study leave from the University of Auckland.
I wish to thank R.M.W. Dixon and Alexandra Aikhenvald for making it possi-
ble for me to spend six months, February–July 2006, at the Research Centre.

    The grammar took its final shape while I was a visitor in the Department of
Linguistics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, for
four months, August–December 2006, while still on research and study leave
from the University of Auckland. I thank Bernard Comrie for making my stay at
the Institute possible.
    I am indebted to Bernard Comrie for reading the near-final version and for
commenting in detail on matters of substance as well as style. The final product
has profited immensely from that. And I wish to thank Juliette Blevins for
comments on chapter 2.
    My thanks to Andrew Hardie for producing the maps and to Andreea
Calude for assistance with the final layout.
    Last but not least, I wish to thank the Walter de Gruyter Foundation for a
generous grant that made publication of this grammar possible.

Introduction
1.1.    The language and the peopleToqabaqita is an Austronesian language spoken at the north-western tip of the
island of Malaita in the Solomon Islands (maps 1.1 and 1.2). Tryon and Hack-
man (1983) consider Toqabaqita to be a dialect of a “North Malaitan” language,
together with Baeguu, Baelelea, and Fataleka (map 1.3 in section 1.3). They say
that Lau could also have been included as another dialect, but they have chosen
to consider it “a separate entity”, for reasons of “tradition” (Tryon and Hack-
man 1983: 27, fn 1). There are a number of other closely related languages
spoken on Malaita. To my knowledge, there is no conception among the Toqa-
baqita people of a single language of which Toqabaqita, Baeguu, Baelelea,
Fataleka, and Lau would be dialects. They do, of course, recognize the similari-
ties between Toqabaqita on the one hand and the other languages/dialects on
the other, just as they recognize the similarities between Toqabaqita and other
languages spoken on Malaita.
    Ethnologue gives the number of speakers of Toqabaqita as 12,572 in 1999
(Gordon 2005), which is a high number in the Solomons Islands context. (Eth-
nologue gives the name of the language as To’abaita.). Although bilingualism
in Toqabaqita and Solomon Islands Pijin is the norm (see chapter 40), it is To-
qabaqita that is the language of daily life. And although children are exposed to
Solomon Islands Pijin at an early age, it is Toqabaqita that they acquire as their
first language. At present the viability of the language is not under threat.
    The Toqabaqita people are primarily subsistence gardeners and practice
swidden agriculture. The main crops are sweet potatoes, taro, slippery cabbage
(Hibiscus manihot), bananas, sugar cane, and cassava. Yam and pana (Dio-
scorea esculenta) are of secondary importance as food crops. Tomatoes, spring
onions, snake beans, and a few other vegetables are also cultivated. The main
tree crops are coconuts, breadruit, canarium nuts, areca nuts, cutnuts (Barring-
tonia sp.), mangoes, pawpaws, guava, and Malay apples. Raising of chickens
and pigs is a common practice. Possums and flying foxes are hunted for meat.
There is some fishing, both in the sea and in the rivers and streams. Tinned tuna
and imported rice feature importantly in the diet of those who can readily afford
them. The gardens are usually located some walking distance from the villages,

               cards.)
           B: ‘Your turn.’ (Lit.: ‘You now.’)    The situational adverb neri has two other functions. First, it is used as a kind
of vividness marker. In this function it is used when the reference is to a state of
affairs in the past. Neri makes that state of affairs more immediate, as if it ob-
tained at the time of reference. In saying the sentences in (13-135) a young man
is telling his mother what happened to him:(13-135)   Qoo,      thaina-ka                  qae, nau      ku

           ‘Oh, mother, I am walking and I, I meet a girl. I look(ed) at the girl.’   In (13-136) it is the man’s answering negatively that is made vivid by means
of neri:(13-136)   Nau ku       so=sa          tha                    weleqi kiiluqa,

‘OK’, ‘right’, ‘all right’. In that function it precedes the clause it connects to the

rogative particles fania or fana can be used in place of fei. Fania and fana are
synonymous. The difference in form between them is reminiscent of the differ-
ence between the full and the reduced forms of the verb-like prepositions (sec-
tion 10.3.1), for example the ablative forms fasi-a (with the third person singu-
lar object suffix -a) and fasa. However, in present-day Toqabaqita at least,
fania and fana do not function as prepositions, and there is no evidence of fania
being morphologically complex (*fani-a).
   In (19-120) variant (b), with fania, expresses a more emphatic, insistent
question about the location than variant (a), with fei, does.(19-120)   a.     Nii          fei    biqu na          maka      kamiliqa
                  be.located   where? house REL        father    1PL(EXCL)                  ki kero          too-too      qi     ei?

                  really want to know,] where is the house where our fathers
                  used to live?’ ‘Where exactly is the house where our fathers
                  used to live?’    In (19-121) all three variants show the possibility of using either the verb nii
or ii ‘be located’ (the latter not being common), and the (b) and (c) variants also
show the possibility of using either fania or fani as the emphatic interrogative
form:(19-121)   a. {Nii       / Ii}               fei    naifa nau        baa?
              be.located / be.located        where? knife 1SG        that

              ‘Where on earth is that knife of mine?’   The constructions nii fania and nii fana have another, non-locative use,
which is discussed in section 19.3.8.
   The next example contains the less common locative verb ii in an elliptical
interrogative:(19-122)   Ii           fei?
           be.located where?
           ‘Where (is it)?’   There is one other way to ask about the location of somebody or something,
which, however, involves neither an interrogative locative form nor a locative
or any other verb. Such sentences consist of a noun phrase where the noun is
modified by the determiner demonstrative of absence baa (section 13.3.2.4).
Frequently, such reduced sentences are introduced by the conjunction ma ‘and’.
There is a rise in intonation at the end of the utterance. Although such questions
are ostensibly non-specific queries about the relevant entity, they are normally
used when the speaker is looking for someone or something that is not where
he/she expects him/her/it to be.","[873, 874, 875]"

17.5.     Emphatic negationIn Toqabaqita, predicate negation can be made stronger, more emphatic in one
of several ways. The double negative construction can, but need not, carry rela-
tively light emphatic force; see (17-33a) and (17-33b) in the preceding section.
Commonly, negation is (further) strengthened by means of the postverbal asser-
tive/intensifying particle boqo (section 5.2.8). In (17-42) boqo is used in a sim-
ple negative construction, in (17-43) in a double negative construction, and in
(17-44) with aqi, which functions as a lexical verb there:
748   Negation

             what?      FOC=2SG.NFUT        want-3SG.OBJ          B: Qe           aqi        boqo.

          A: ‘What do you want?’
          B: ‘Nothing (at all).’ (‘There is nothing [that I want].’)(For negative answers to open questions see section 19.4.3.)
   Negation using the verb aqi as a lexical verb ‘not be so, not be the case’,
‘not exist’, ‘not be available’ can be made more emphatic by means of the per-
fect marker/intensifier naqa (sections 5.2.12 and 15.3). This strategy is not
available to the simple or the double negative constructions. Sometimes, naqa
does mark the perfect with aqi:(17-45)   Maala      b=e           tharu-fi               nau
          sore       that=3SG.NFUT (sore)afflict-TR       1SG          qe=aqi                 naqa! Maala       baa    e

          (sore)heal PRF
          ‘The sore that I had (lit.: that afflicted me) is no more! The sore has
          healed!’   However, frequently some degree of emphasis is present in addition to the
perfect:(17-46)   Nau wane ku                rii-riki-qi      doo, manga
          1SG man 1SG.NFUT           RDP-see-DETR     thing time

           this 3SG.NFUT not.be.so         PRF/INTS
           ‘I used to be rich (lit.: I used to see things), (but) this time no
           more/not at all.’ ‘I used to be a man who was rich; this time no
           more/not at all.’    But it is possible for naqa to express strong negation, without any sense of
the perfect. The three expressions in (17-47) can all function as answers to po-
lar interrogatives. The one in (a) is neutral, the one in (b) relatively emphatic,
and the one in (c) highly emphatic:(17-47)    a.     Qe           aqi.
                  3SG.NFUT     not.be.so
                  ‘No.’           b.     Qe           aqi          boqo.
                  3SG.NFUT     not.be.so    ASRT
                  ‘No.’           c.     Qe             aqi        naqa.
                  3SG.NFUT not.be.so        INTS
                  ‘Not at all.’ ‘No way.’   The situational demonstrative adverbs neri and nena, which are historically
fusions of the perfect-marker/intensifier naqa and the demonstratives qeri and
qena, respectively, can alo be used to make negation more emphatic (section
13.7)(17-48)    Qe           aqi          nena!
           3SG.NFUT not.be.so        NPAST.THERE
           ‘Not there!’ (Don’t look there.)    Negation by means of aqi as a lexical verb and by means of the double nega-
tive construction can be made emphatic by means of either the Class 1 transi-
tive verb dolo-fi ‘smooth, make smooth’ or the related intransitive proprietive
verb doodolo-qa ‘be smooth’. The first two examples show the two verbs in
their basic meanings:(17-49)    Nau kwai    dolo-fi-a       fasi qaaqae-na     matau

           ‘The path is smooth, level (without bumps).’   Both dolo-fi and doodolo-qa can be used in [verb verb] compounds (section
12.5) with aqi as a lexical verb. Aqi comes first. The negation is strongly em-
phatic.","[800, 801, 802, 803]"

           ‘What time is it now?’ (Lit.: ‘How manieth of time now?’)   The question in (19-113) is about clock time. For other ways to ask about
clock time see examples (19-89) and (19-91) in section 19.3.4, and (19-108) in

"
13.6.2. The presentative locative demonstrative adverbsThe presentative demonstrative adverbs are used when the entity in question is
visible at that location and can be pointed at or pointed out (as when a speaker
is holding it in his or her hands). Syntactically, they can function as part of the
predicate (see [4-1] in section 4.1), or they can form the predicate. They tend to
be said emphatically, with relatively strong stress and on higher pitch, espe-
cially when they alone form the predicate. With the exception of the addressee-
proximal form nena, all the others end in a syllable that consists of a glottal
stop and a vowel that is identical to the vowel in the preceding syllable: neqe,
lakoqo, fuqu, etc. More often than not, the final vowel is deleted (see section
2.2.1): neq, lakoq, fuq, etc. Adverb phrases that contain a presentative adverb
do not function as complements of prepositions.
    The first set of examples contains verbless sentences with the presentative
demonstratives forming the predicate. In this function the adverbs are used in
presentational identificational sentences (section 27.2.2.2).",[661]
"
9.1.2. Double nominalizationsThe term “double nominalization” designates nominalizations that contain two
instances of the nominalizing suffix. They can be formed only from transitive
verbs, and they always carry a personal suffix indexing the possessor. One in-
stance of the nominalizing suffix occurs before and the other after the personal
suffix:(9-31)     gani-la-na-laa
           ask.sb.(for.st.)-NMLZ-3SG.PERS-NMLZ
           ‘asking him/her (for st., to do st.)’   Double nominalizations are possible only if there is no possessor noun
phrase. If there is a possessor noun phrase, only single nominalizations are
grammatical:(9-32)   a.   *gani-la-na-laa                           wane
              ask.sb.(for.st.)-NMLZ-3.PERS-NMLZ         man
              (‘asking the man [for st., to do st.]’)         b.   gani-la-na                        wane
              ask.sb.(for.st.)-NMLZ-3.PERS man
              ‘asking the man (for st., to do st.)’   Double nominalizations are never obligatory; single nominalizations can
always be used instead. Most commonly, double nominalizations occur in
oblique-object positions, where they are sometimes judged to be “stronger”,
“more forceful” than single nominalizations. The first example below shows
the free variation between a single and a double nominalization:(9-33)     A: Qo           gani-a                 naqa wane baa        ura

             A: ‘Have you asked the man for money?’
             B: ‘No, I haven’t. I am ashamed to ask him.’ (Lit.: ‘My body is
                ashamed about asking him.’)   In (9-34), where the nominalization does not have a possessor noun phrase,
double nominalization is possible, while in (9-35), where the nominalization
has a lexical possessor, only single nominalization is possible:(9-34)       Qo           lae      mai      uri-a

           CAUS-be.straight-TR-NMLZ-1SG.PERS-NMLZ
           ‘They [the speaker’s parents] would give me whippings to straighten
           me, ….’ (That is, when the speaker was little, his parents would give
           him whippings to make him behave.)   In (9-37) the double nominalization is based on a Class 2 transitive verb. Not
only is the nominalization double, but it also contains both an object suffix and
a personal suffix:(9-37)     B: Qoo, nau lio-ku                qe       dora        qana
              oh 1SG mind-1SG.PERS           3SG.NFUT forget      GENP              soe-toqo-da-la-na-laa.

           [A: ‘When will those people arrive?’]
           B:    ‘Oh, I forgot to ask them.’ (Lit.: ‘Oh, I, my mind forgot its
                 asking them.’)   See the synonymous sentence in (9-15) in section 9.1.1 with a single nomi-
nalization.
   Double nominalizations are not ungrammatical in positions other than
oblique object, but there single nominalizations are clearly preferred. Example
(9-38) shows a double nominalization in the direct-object position, as a possi-
ble, but dispreferred alternative to the single nominalization:(9-38)     Ili-toqo-na   {qani-la-na              /
           do-TEST-3.OBJ eat-NMLZ-3SG.PERS        /           qani-la-na-laa}.
           eat-NMLZ-3SG.PERS-NMLZ
           ‘Try eating it.’
9.1.3.   Nominal and verbal properties of nominalizationsIn Toqabaqita, nominalizations exhibit properties both of nouns and of verbs.29
Their nominal characteristics will be considered first. Nominalizations occur in
positions in which nouns occur, and they take modifiers that only nouns can
take, albeit with some restrictions.
   There are some complexities when nominalizations head the possessum
phrase in possessive noun phrases, and these constructions are discussed first.
432      Nominalizations and deverbal nouns
The distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs is relevant here, and so
is the distinction between Class 1 and Class 2 transitive verbs.
    First, nominalizations of intransitive verbs need not occur in a possessive
construction:(9-39)       Raa-laa       naqi e               tekwa    quu.
             work-NMLZ this 3SG.NFUT be.long ANTCONT
             ‘There is still a lot of this work (to be done).’ (Lit.: ‘This working is
             still long.’)   When a nominalization of an intransitive verb heads a possessum phrase, the
possessor always corresponds to the subject of the source verb. As a norm,
nominalizations of intransitive verbs occur in the suffixing possessive noun
phrase. However, nominalizations of some verbs can occur in the possessum
position of the bare possessive noun phrase (see further below). The next two
examples show nominalizations in the possessum position of the suffixing pos-
sessive construction:(9-40)       tekwa-la-na                biqu       qeri
             be.long-NMLZ-3.PERS        house      this

             speak-NMLZ-3PL.PERS 3SG.NFUT be.good
             ‘Their speaking is/was good.’ (For example: what they said was
             good; or the way they spoke was good.)   Some nominalizations have acquired more of a noun status with their own
meanings, other than signifying a state of affairs. For example, the nominaliza-
tion of the depatientive verb kwai-qadomi ‘help (people)’ occurs in the posses-
sum position of the bare possessive construction with the meaning ‘help, assis-
tance’:(9-42)       kwai-qadomi-laa qoe
             LIP-help-NMLZ      2SG
             ‘your help (help that you provide)’   And the nominalization of qafetaqi ‘be difficult to do, difficult to cope with,
difficult to do st. about’ occurs in the possessum position of the bare possessive
construction with the meaning ‘difficulty, problem (that one has encountered)’:

sive constructions for the difference between the nominalization of leqa ‘be
good’ in the suffixing construction (‘his being good’) and in the bare construc-
tion (‘your goodness’).
    Nominalizations of a few verbs can be used in either type of possessive con-
structions without any appreciable difference in meaning:(9-44)     a.    Too-la-ku                             qe

‘be in a certain condition’. It is used with this meaning in questions and state-
ments about a person’s well-being.)(9-45)     Ku           riki-a       raa-la-mu

             ‘I saw your work(ing), and it was good.’   There is also some variability among speakers as to how readily they accept
nominalizations of intransitive verbs in the bare construction. For example,
while the suffixing construction in (9-47a) is fully acceptable, the correspond-
ing bare construction is not always acceptable. And to the extent that it is ac-
ceptable, its range of meaning is narrower than that of the suffixing construc-
tion:(9-47)       a.    ngata-la-da
                   speak-NMLZ-3PL.PERS
                   ‘their speaking’ (for example, what they said, the way they
                   speak, their language)             b.    ngata-laa kera
                   speak-NMLZ 3PL
                   ‘their language’    The suffixing construction is not used if there is a related bare Class 1 tran-
sitive verb of the same form, because with nominalizations of such transitive
verbs the personal suffix can only index the argument that corresponds to the
direct object of the source verb. For example, there is an intransitive verb luqu
‘answer, respond’, and a bare transitive verb luqu ‘answer (somebody, question,
letter, etc.), respond to’; see (9-48) and (9-49) below, respectively. The nomi-
nalization of the intransitive verb occurs in the bare possessive construction;
the possessor corresponds to the subject. On the other hand, the nominalization
of the transitive verb occurs in the suffixing construction; the possessor corre-
sponds to the direct object.","[458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463]"

13.3.2.4.   The determiner demonstrative of absenceToqabaqita has a determiner demonstrative that in its exophoric function sig-
nals that the referent of the noun phrase is absent from the speaker’s sphere.
The form of the demonstrative is baa. Unlike the other exophoric determiners,
baa signals not the current location of an entity, but its absence from the
speaker’s sphere. The entity used to be in the speaker’s sphere but no longer is,
or it should be in the speaker’s sphere but is not. Baa is commonly used in
questions to ask about the whereabouts of someone or something, for example,
when looking for him/her/it.",[643]

27.2.4. Absence of subjects in the major verbless sentence typesIt is possible for a verbless sentences not to have a subject; only the predicate is
present. This is true both of the identificational and of the ascriptive sentence
types. However, subjects cannot be absent when the predicate consists of a
presentative locative demonstrative adverb or of a reiterative demonstrative
pronominal.
    In most cases the subject is absent when the referent is recoverable from
context, linguistic or extra-linguistic. Identificational sentences are frequently
subjectless because the intended referent is obvious from the extra-linguistic
context (and usually can even be pointed at). In the situation expressed in (27-
29), person A, on seeing a bird, uses a subjectless verbless question and person
B responds with a subjectless verbless answer. In both sentences the predicates
contain the situational demonstrative adverb neri.

           A: ‘What’s the bird?’

is the case in the examples in (27-30) – (27-33), where the subjectless verbless
clauses are ascriptive.
    In (27-30) the subjectless verbless clause forms the apodosis of a conditional
sentence. The referents of the ellipted subject are the pictures (the things that
had been painted) mentioned in the first clause:(27-30)    Nau kwa               riki-a        ba-kuqa      doo kera

           pictures looked so lifelike that if they only moved they would be just
           like real people.)   In (27-31) the referent of the ellipted subject noun phrase is the content of
the direct speech in the preceding sentence, what the man said:(27-31)    Wane       ni       thau wane       qeri ka              quna   qeri,

verb occurs in its detransitivized form and takes paratactic complement clauses
(sections 29.4.7 and 29.4.8).
   The sentence in (27-32) contains a subjectless verbless relative clause:(27-32)    … mika          lio, mika          riki-a              iqa

           ‘… we looked and saw the fish which (were) big sharks ….’   For more examples of subjectless verbal clauses see (27-36) and (27-37) in
section 27.2.5.
   There is one type of verbless sentence that is always subjectless. This is a
type of positive possessive sentence that consists of a noun phrase that contains
the possessive marker qa- with a personal suffix that encodes the possessor and
a noun phrase that encodes the possessum:(27-33)    Qa-muqa          ta      ama?
           POSS-2SG.PERS    some    hammer
           ‘Do you have a hammer?’ (Lit.: ‘(Is there) of yours a hammer?’)   See section 26.2.1.1 for detail.","[993, 994, 995]"
"   And in (2-90) the feminine person marker /n+/ has fused with the preceding
possessum noun and the personal suffix indexing the possessor has been elided:(2-90)     /6a+na-na        n+               a0ar+!+/
           mother-3.PERS PERSMKR             Fangariqi
           ‘Fangariqi’s mother’           with fusion: /6a+na=n+            a0ar+!+/
                       mother:3.PERS=PERSMKR Fangariqi    The verbs /snr'-!'/ and /snr'-!a/ ‘think that, assume that’, with the detransi-
tivizing suffix /-!'/ ~ /-!a/, sometimes fuse with the following irrealis marker
/sa/ ~ /sn/ as /sn=sa/ or /sn=sn/: ‘think’:DETR=IRR. See, for example, (29-138)
and (29-139), respectively, in section 29.4.8.
    As mentioned above, the third person singular subject marker typically cliti-
cizes onto the following negative verb /a!+/ and it is the subject marker that
carries word-initial stress. There is no loss of phonological material here paral-
lel to what happens in fusion. However, because of the shift in stress, unlike
elsewhere when the subject marker cliticizes onto the following verb, this type
of phonological unity is marked in the rest of the grammar as involving fusion.

              w                  w    The set of orthographic symbols employed in this grammar departs from the
traditional orthography in the representation of the glottal stop and (partly) in
the representation of /0/. Present-day Toqabaqita writing conventions follow
those established by South Sea Evangelical Mission missionaries in their trans-
lation of the New Testament (Na alaofua falu: …. [1923 (1977)]. There the
symbol n is used to represent /0/, and the apostrophe to represent the glottal
stop. These days the diagraph ng is quite commonly used instead of n, espe-
cially by the younger people, and I have adopted ng here for typographical con-
venience.
    The glottal stop is rarely represented in the translation of the New Testament
and in the conventional orthography. I have decided to use the letter q to repre-
sent the glottal stop. The apostrophe is not a letter and does not distinguish
between the lower and the upper cases.4 By writing the glottal stop consistently,
I have already departed from the conventional orthography. (I have retained the
                                                   2.6 Orthographic conventions   41apostrophe in those proper names that are, at least sometimes, written in that
way, for example, Foana’ota [a personal name] and Malu’u [a place name].
However, the letter q is used here consistently in the name of the language, the
people and the area, Toqabaqita.) And there are other respects in which the way
the language is written here departs from conventional writing. In conventional
writing, double vowels are written as single, while sequences of two identical
vowel letters are used when in fact there is a glottal stop in between. And in
some cases what is analyzed in this grammar as a single although polymor-
phemic word is written as a sequence of words in conventional writing.
   Speakers of Toqabaqita that I have spoken to about the issue of the glottal
stop readily agree that there is a phonological difference between words that are
distinguished only by the presence and absence of a glottal stop; for example
/!ab7/ ‘blood’ and /ab7/ ‘be taboo, not allowed, forbidden’, ‘be sacred, holy (in
the Christian sense)’, although the two words are written in the same way. They
also agree that it would be useful for the difference to be reflected in writing.
They are aware of grammatical errors in the translation of the New Testament;
and even though copies of the translation are available, it is not much used in
church (one of the English versions being normally used).
   Some additional orthographic symbols are used here to represent sounds that
are not part of the Toqabaqita inventory of phonemes and that occur in code
mixing (section 40.3). These are listed in table 2.4.","[68, 69, 70]"

            ‘I’ll come and see you again next Sunday, without fail (lit.: it will
            not not be the case).’   The lexical verb aqi is used in a bi-clausal construction to signal that a po-
tential situation will/should not obtain because of some disabling conditions
(section 17.6). It is also used in negative counterparts of grammatically positive
verbless sentences, and to negate fragments of clauses from which the verb
complex has been omitted; see section 27.2.5.
   Occasionally, although only relatively rarely, the final vowel of aqi is real-
ized as [']. This may happen when the third person singular nonfuture subject
marker qe and aqi fuse together as one phonological word, in particular as a
negative answer to a question: [!'pa!'] ‘No’. (For fusion of qe and aqi see fur-
ther below in the next section.)
17.4.     The double negative constructionA clause may be negated grammatically solely by means of a negative subject
marker. There is, however, also a complex, double negative construction that
consists of an event clause negated by means of a negative subject marker pre-
ceded by a “mini-clause” that consists of the negative verb aqi and a third per-
son singular subject marker. Furthermore, the aqi mini-clause may be preceded
by a noun phrase that corresponds to the subject of the event clause. The event
clause cannot contain a subject phrase. Two subtypes of the double negative
construction need to be distinguished, depending on the subject marker in the
aqi mini-clause. In one, the subject marker is the third person singular nonfu-
ture form qe. For convenience, this construction will be referred to as the “gen-
eral” double negative construction. Its structure is shown schematically in (17-
24):(17-24)     (NP) [qe aqi] [negative.event.clause]   For example:(17-25)     [Qe          aqi]     [kwasi riki-a].

           and she would pick it up.)    In the other subtype, the subject marker in the aqi mini-clause is the third
person singular sequential form ka. This type of negative construction is joined
to a preceding clause or sentence, with or without the coordinating construction
ma ‘and’. This construction is used to express unfulfilled expectation: a situa-
tion expressed or implied in preceding discourse did/does not obtain. For con-
venience, this kind of construction will be referred to as the “sequential” double
negative construction. Its structure is shown schematically in (17-27):(17-27)    … (ma) (NP) [ka aqi] ([negative.event.clause])   For example:(17-28)    Kamiliqa mili                    lio, ka      aqi

           ‘I did ask him, but (lit.: and) he did not answer me.’    The sequential negative construction is discussed in section 16.3, where
more examples can be found. As also shown there, in clauses expressing unful-
filled expectations aqi also functions as a lexical verb when there is no negative
event clause:(17-30)    Sa     keki    lae mai, ma ka             aqi.

           ‘They should have come but did not.’ ‘They were expected to come
           but did not.’
                                       17.4 The double negative construction   743   In general, negation expresses denial of a presupposition or contradiction
(Givón 1984), which in itself does not distinguish between the general negative
construction and the sequential one. However, there are several types of differ-
ence between the two. First, the two constructions use different third person
singular subject markers in the aqi mini-clause: nonfuture and sequential, re-
spectively. Second, the sequential construction is usually structurally closely
integrated with the preceding discourse. More often than not, it and the preced-
ing clause(s) are part of the same sentence. On the other hand, there is often no
such integration in the case of the general negative construction. Sentences with
the general construction may be used without any prior relevant discourse:(17-31)    Qe          aqi      qosi           thaofa?
           3SG.NFUT NEGV        2SG.NEG        be.hungry
           ‘Aren’t you hungry?’(For the use of negative polar interrogatives see section 19.2.1.)
   Third, in the case of the sequential negative construction, the expected situa-
tion is either explicitly expressed or strongly implied in a preceding clause,
while the presupposition denied or contradicted by the general construction
need not be. For one thing, there need not be any directly relevant preceding
discourse. Fourth, the general double negative construction has a simple coun-
terpart, where negation is achieved by the negative subject markers alone. The
sequential negative construction has no such counterpart. And finally, there are
also prosodic differences between the two constructions. These are discussed
further below.
   With the exception of non-predicate negation, where the verb complex func-
tions as a noun modifier, the general double negative strategy is available wher-
ever the simple strategy is. The double negative construction is strongly pre-
ferred over the simple one if the subject of the negative event clause is third-
person singular. In (17-32) the double construction is used in the first part of
the sentence, where the event clause has a third-person singular subject, and the
simple construction is used in the final clause, which has a first-person singular
subject:(17-32)    Nia    e=aqi         si      naqo-fi nau, nau
           3SG    3SG.NFUT=NEGV 3SG.NEG face-TR 1SG 1SG           kwasi     naqo-fi-a.
           1SG.NEG front-TR-3.OBJ
           ‘She would not face me, (and) I would not face her.’ (In earlier
           times, this was the proper way for a man and a woman who were not
           husband and wife to be positioned when speaking to each other.)
744    Negation
   The double construction may be used when the negation is to be made some-
what emphatic. For example, a person is more likely to use (17-33a) rather than
(17-33b) if he or she wants to emphasize that they are not hungry:(17-33)    a.     Nau qe=aqi         kwasi  thaofa.
                  1SG 3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry
                  ‘I am not hungry.’           b.     Nau kwasi      thaofa.
                  1SG 1SG.NEG be.hungry
                  ‘I am not hungry.’   However, the double construction is also commonly used in non-emphatic
negation.
   There is one grammatical difference between the simple and the general
double negative constructions that concerns the expression of the subject. In the
simple construction, the event clause may have a subject noun phrase, lexical or
pronominal, in addition to the negative subject marker:(17-34)    Toqa     baa kesi         fula.
           people that 3PL.NEG arrive
           ‘The people did not arrive.’(17-35)    Nau kwasi      thaofa.
           1SG 1SG.NEG be.hungry
           ‘I am not hungry.’    On the other hand, in the double construction, no subject noun phrase is
possible in the event clause. The only way the relevant participant may be en-
coded by a noun phrase is as a topic preceding the mini-clause with the nega-
tive verb aqi:(17-36)
   NP(TOPIC)i [subject.marker aqi] [negative.subject.markeri verb ...]    This is illustrated by the grammaticality of (17-37a) and the ungrammatical-
ity of (17-37b):(17-37)    a. Nau qe=aqi         kwasi  thaofa.
              1SG 3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry
              ‘I am not hungry.’
                                         17.4 The double negative construction   745           b. *Qe=aqi            nau      kwasi   thaofa.
              3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG           1SG.NEG be.hungry
              (‘I am not hungry.’)   Compare the ungrammatical (17-37b), with the subject pronoun in the event
clause, and the grammatical (17-35), with the subject in the simple negative
construction.
   Topic noun phrases are not obligatory with the double negative construction,
as illustrated in (17-38), which is synonymous with (17-37a) (and with [17-
35]):(17-38)    Qe=aqi             kwasi thaofa.
           3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry
           ‘I am not hungry.’   The noun phrase that precedes the aqi mini-clause is not its subject; it is a
topic phrase. The subject marker of aqi can only be third-person singular, re-
gardless of the grammatical person and number of the preceding noun phrase.
In (17-37a) further above, that noun phrase is first person singular, and in (17-
39) below it is first person plural exclusive.","[793, 794, 795, 796, 797, 798]"

one of the endophoric demonstratives, rather than naqi. However, the use of
naqi not only signals to the addressee identifiability of the referent, it also
brings the past situation into the context of the speech act.
    The speaker-proximal demonstratives can be used contrastively to oppose
something that is “near” compared to something that is “over there”, or to op-
pose “this side” to the “other side”. This is possible even if the location or the
side in question is not, objectively, near the speaker; but it is treated, meta-
phorically, as if it were. In the next example, the speaker uses neqe with this
contrastive function, even though he himself was not involved in the situation
being described (the text is a traditional story). The deictic centre is the speaker
and his audience, and the two sides are being spoken of as if they were nearer
to and farther from them, respectively.",[637]

by the presence of the third person object marker -a on thathami. See also sec-

is of the impersonal or the personal type. In (29-41) the omitted subject marker
could, in principle, be third person singular functioning non-referentially, or
second person singular:

           ‘Oh, my friendly man, can you/is it possible for you to shine a torch
           in front of me (so that I can move in the dark) ....’   However, when there is evidence available, as in the case of (29-40) above,
the construction is always of the impersonal type when the modal verb occurs
without a subject marker.
   Clauses as direct objects of the modal verbs can express states of affairs that
obtain on specific occasions, or they can express generic, habitual (types of)
states of affairs not restricted to a given occasion; see, for example, (29-37) and
(29-36) above, respectively, for the personal construction, and (29-40) and (29-
38), respectively, for the impersonal construction.
   Both modal verbs, talaqa and faara, can also take nominalizations as their
direct objects. However, nominalizations are much less common than comple-
ment clauses, and they can only be used in the personal type of construction.
That is, the subject of the modal verb must be referential, expressing the actor
participant in the state of affairs expressed by the nominalization. The nomi-
nalization construction is used when the state of affairs in question is a general,
habitual one, rather than one that obtains on a specific occasion. In cases of
generic, habitual situations, either a finite complement clause or a nominaliza-
tion is possible, as in (29-42a) and (29-42b), respectively:(29-42)    a.     Nia e        talaqa-na kai
                  3SG 3SG.NFUT fit-3.OBJ 3SG.FUT                  qaru-toqo-na     kwanga.

verb leqa ‘be good, nice’. That which is characterized as good is normally also
permitted. See example (29-213) in section 29.4.12.
   The third modal verb discussed here is abu ‘be taboo, forbidden; not be al-
lowed’. Abu is an intransitive verb. It takes paratactic complement clauses. The
subject marker of abu is always third person singular, impersonal, semantically-
empty. There are no restrictions on the tense/mood/sequentiality subject mark-
ers in its complement clauses.","[1049, 1050, 1051]"

of potential candidates is not clearly defined: the addressee as against every
human being?
   Contrastiveness is not a binary notion, rather a gradient one (see, for exam-
ple, Lambrecht [1994], following Bolinger [1961]). It ranges from clear, ex-
plicit contrast where the alternatives are identified, as for example in (39-49)
above (the speaker and the addressee), to implicit contrast where only the can-
didate to which the proposition applies is identified, the other or others being
suggested more or less strongly, as in (39-50) (the other members of the old
man’s family), in (39-51) (all other humans?), and in (39-52) (all other con-
ceivable functions that food might have?).
   The focus construction is used with two other functions. In one it is a clause
that is in focus. The clause in focus expresses the reason for, or the cause of,
the situation expressed in the presupposition domain. The reason/cause is high-
lighted, emphasized:(39-53)    Qo       ade qufita            na    qaba-mu      ka

           arm?’ ‘How did your arm get broken’?
1290    Focusing
   Focused reason clauses are discussed in section 33.2.2
   And second, the consequence marker adelana can be put in focus to empha-
size the fact that the situation expressed in the presupposition clause is indeed
the consequence of the situation expressed in another, usually the immediately
preceding, clause; see (39-27) in section 39.2, and chapter 34.
Chapter 40
Toqabaqita, Solomon Islands Pijin, and English
40.1.   IntroductionAs a norm, Toqabaqita people are bilingual in their own language and in Solo-
mon Islands Pijin, an English-lexifier creole, which is the lingua franca in the
Solomon Islands. School education is in English, and so some people, espe-
cially those of the younger generations, with several years of formal education,
have some knowledge of English. Furthermore, people also tend to have at least
some passive knowledge of the neighbouring languages and dialects.
    Borrowing from Pijin into Toqabaqita has been quite extensive, but with the
exceptions of numerals, it has been restricted to lexical items that belong in the
major, open classes of nouns and verbs, the former in particular. There is no
evidence of borrowing of grammatical items or of structural borrowing. By
borrowing is here meant the adoption of a Pijin lexical item into the lexicon of
Toqabaqita, which often necessitates phonological accommodation. This is to
be distinguished from code-mixing, where Pijin words are used in Toqabaqita
discourse in a basically ad hoc manner, often without being accommodated to
Toqabaqita phonological patterns. However, the distinction between estab-
lished borrowings and code-mixing is not a hard and fast one. Some Pijin words
happen to fit the phonological patterns of Toqabaqita and so no accommodation
is necessary. Second, some Pijin words that do not fit the phonological patterns
of Toqabaqita are used commonly in Toqabaqita discourse without accommo-
dation. And third, one and the same Pijin etymon may sometimes be used in an
accommodated form and sometimes in a non-accommodated form, even by the
same speaker. The boundaries of the Toqabaqita lexicon are not clear-cut. For
discussion of this with respect to what should or should not be included in a
dictionary of Toqabaqita see Lichtenberk (2003b).
    The discussion that follows is concerned only with borrowing and code-
mixing that involves Solomon Islands Pijin or, occasionally, English. It is not
concerned with borrowing and code-mixing that involves the neighbouring or
nearby lects. Because of the close similarities between Toqabaqita and the other
lects, borrowings and instances of code-switching are difficult to identify in the
absence of a detailed study. Not infrequently, speakers of Toqabaqita disagree
among themselves whether a given word is a borrowing from a neighbouring or
a nearby lect or not.
1292     Toqabaqita, Pijin, and English
    It needs to be kept in mind that the main donor/source language, Solomon
Islands Pijin, itself is not monolithic. There is a large amount of variation with
respect to how anglicized a person’s Pijin is. On the whole, urban Pijin has
more English features than rural Pijin. Second, people with extensive formal
education in English tend to speak Pijin with more English features than speak-
ers with little or no such education. And the extent of English features in a per-
son’s Pijin may also depend on the speech situation itself: one and the same
person may use more anglicized Pijin in formal contexts than in informal con-
texts. (See Jourdan [2002] for a brief mention of the difficulties with drawing a
line between Pijin and English.) The kind of Pijin a person speaks may also be

           A: ‘I saw a snake under this house.’
           B: ‘You saw what under the house?’   Interrogatives with interrogative phrases in focus tend to be used, although
not exclusively, when there is no immediately preceding linguistic context that
demands repetition, confirmation, or elaboration. For example, when seeing
somebody eat something, one could ask the question in (19-27):
798    Interrogatives
(19-27)    Taa      n=o               qani-a?
           what? FOC=2SG.NFUT         eat-3SG.OBJ
           ‘What are you eating?’ ‘What is it you are eating?’   However, the distinction between open interrogatives with the interrogative
phrase in situ and those with fronted interrogative phrases in terms of their use
is not categorical. For example, interrogatives with fronted interrogative
phrases can also be used to ask for repetition, elaboration, or confirmation. In
(19-28) the speaker is asking for repetition, elaboration after not hearing well
what piece of the other person’s property had been damaged:(19-28)    Taa      qoe na       kera       laba-tani-a?
           what? 2SG FOC 3PL.NFUT damage-TR-3SG.OBJ
           ‘What of yours did they damage?’   Both types of interrogative, with and without fronting, can be used in re-
sponse to very much the same extra-linguistic context. For example, when see-
ing somebody look for something, either type is possible and common:(19-29)    Taa      n=o                rofe-a?
           what? FOC=2SG.NFUT          look.for-3SG.OBJ
           ‘What are you looking for?’(19-30)    Kera        rofe-a           taa?
           3PL.NFUT look.for-3.OBJ what?
           ‘What are they looking for?’   However, there are syntactic environments where the interrogative phrase
must be fronted. This is true of interrogative phrases that correspond to the
subject of the sentence, although with one type of exception. Thus, where (19-
31a) with a fronted and focused tei ‘who?’ interrogative phrase is grammatical,
(19-31b) without fronting/focusing is not:(19-31)    a.     Tei n=e                  lae    mai?
                  who? FOC=3SG.NFUT        go     VENT

locative demonstrative adverb or a situational demonstrative adverb forming the
predicate are not in focus; see (19-33) and (19-34), respectively:(19-33)    Tei      nena?

animate coordinands.) In every coordinate noun phrase the coordinands were of
the same animacy status. With human coordinands, ma and bia were just about
equally common: 29 instances of ma versus 27 instances of bia. On the other
hand, the distribution of ma and bia was highly skewed with inanimate coordi-

use of bia with inanimate coordinands reflects its origin as a comitative prepo-
sition, which normally takes human complements.
    Occasionally, the categorial status of bia (or bii) either as a coordinator or as
a comitative preposition is not transparent. For example in (11-18) it could be
interpreted as either, without any great semantic difference:(11-18)    Ku             riki-a        kukeqe       bia                wela

           b. ‘I saw the woman with her children.’    Mostly, however, the status of bia as a coordinator rather than a preposition
is clear. For example, in (11-19) both coordinands are singular but the coordi-
nate noun phrase is dual, as evidenced by the dual subject marker keko:(11-19)    ... wane qeri bia          kwai-na         keko

           ‘... the man and his wife thought of going down to the market place.’   And in (11-20) there are three coordinands rather than a noun phrase fol-
lowed by two comitative prepositional phrases. The story in question is not
(primarily) about the man. It is about all three people. The man is in no sense
the primary character.","[569, 570]"

37.6.     Direct speech introduced by a clause that contains a verb other
          than a verb of speakingIt is possible for a direct speech to be “introduced” by a clause that contains not
a verb of speaking nor the pseudo-verb quna qeri ‘this manner; thus’, but some
other verb. A clause with a verb of speaking has been omitted. In some cases
the first clause expresses a situation that leads a participant to say something. In
(37-22) and (37-23) the clauses that introduce the direct speeches contain the
verbs ‘see’ and ‘hear’, respectively:(37-22)     Bariqi    lio ka             riki-a,         “Taa      neri?

            [and said to the children], “What’s this? Oh, it’s a bird (lit.: [a] bird
            here).”.’(37-23)     Kero     rongo-a    thaqaro fuu ki,             “Qoo,     thaqaro

             ‘They [possum hunters] heard the possums [and one of them said],
             “Oh, that must be the possums. There is a possum here now.”.’(Thaqaro may be used to refer to birds or to possums.)
    Clearly, the instances of direct speech in (37-22) and (37-23) are not direct
objects of the sensory-perception verbs. What the direct speech expresses is not
what the participants saw and heard, respectively, but their reaction to what
they saw and heard.
    In (37-24) below, the clause preceding the direct speech contains the intran-
sitive verb qinkwayeri ‘hold an inquiry’ from English/Solomon Islands Pijin.
Qinkwayeri is not a verb of speaking here (‘inquire’). The direct speech is a
statement, accusation, not a question. Here the direct speech expresses what
was said during the inquiry.","[1286, 1287]"

differences in the degree of prenasalization, depending on the sound in question
and on the position in a word (section 2.1.2). There is always prenasalization
word-medially, and this is what is relevant here. Pijin does allow homorganic
nasal-consonant sequences word-medially and word-finally. When a Pijin word
contains a sequence of a nasal and a voiced stop, the sequence is realized in
Toqabaqita as a prenasalized voiced stop:(40-7)      Pijin                         Toqaqaqita            namba                         naba (n.) ‘number’

cluster is usually replaced by a (prenasalized) voiced stop with the same place
of articulation as the Pijin consonants.","[1346, 1347]"

27.2.2.2. Presentational identificational sentencesPresentational identificational sentences serve “to make the identity of a refer-
ent known to the hearer. ... [they] provide an object, or a class of objects, with a
‘name’, which may from now on be used by the hearer in referring to it.” (Stas-
sen 1997: 2001).
   There are two subtypes of presentational identificational sentences in Toqa-
baqita. Both are also discussed and illustrated in the chapter on demonstratives
and demonstrative adverbs (chapter 13), and here they are mentioned only
briefly. In one subtype the predicate is an adverb phrase that consists of a pre-
sentative locative demonstrative adverb (section 13.6.2). This type of construc-
tion is used when the entity in question is visible and can be pointed at or
pointed out.","[988, 989]"

           into hardship/difficulty or danger.’   In expressions of negative purpose, a clause in the timitive mood may func-
tion as the complement of one of the two purpose markers fasi or uri, but this is
quite rare, and the purpose markers are never obligatory. While fasi can be used
without ada to express negative purpose (see section 33.3.4 for examples), uri
                                                          18.6 The timitive mood   785can be used in this function only in a timitive clause. In (18-85) the purpose
marker is fasi:(18-85)    Ngali-a    kaleko       qaaqako,      fasi-a          ada    qoko

           ‘Take (some) warm clothes so that you are not cold at night.’   Compare the synonymous example (18-87) further below without the pur-
pose marker.
   In (18-86) the timitive clause is the complement of the purpose marker uri:(18-86)    Nau ku               kani-a        botho naqi qana maqe
           1SG 1SG.NFUT         tie-3.OBJ     pig this GENP CLF           qai naqi, uri-a                ada ka           thaka.

           ‘I tied the (lit.: this) pig to the post so that it might not run away.’    In the in-case subtype of precautionary situations, the state of affairs ex-
pressed in the clause preceding the timitive clause does not serve to prevent the
undesirable situation from coming about. Rather, that clause expresses what
could/should be done in case the undesirable situation does take place. That
situation will not be prevented, but some counteracting measures may be taken.
In some cases, the counteracting measure will alleviate the effects of the unde-
sirable situation. Compare the next two examples. The first one is of the pre-
ventive type: the speaker is telling the addressee to take warm clothes in order
that he (the addressee) may not feel cold:(18-87)    Ngali-a    kaleko qaaqako ada             qoko    gwagwari

addressee to take warm clothes, but even if the latter does take some, that will
not prevent the night from being cold. However, it will alleviate the effects of
the cold on the addressee:

           be cold tonight.’   In the situation expressed in the next example, looking under the timber will
not prevent ants from being there, but if there are ants there, the addressee can
take a counteracting measure, such as cleaning the board before using it or not
using it at all:(18-89)    Lio fas=i     faar-a                          ada    ta   fuufusi

each other semantically, a sentence may be ambiguous between the two inter-
pretations. In the next example either interpretation is possible: the person’s
looking out for the enemy may prevent the enemy’s coming and doing some-

undesirable. There need not be any preceding clause or sentence, or if there is
one it does not contain a verb of fearing nor does it express a precautionary
situation. The first example below expresses the speaker’s concern that it might
rain:(18-91)    Ada dani ka          qaru.
           TIM rain 3SG.SEQ fall
           ‘It might/may rain.’   The speaker is less-than-fully certain that it will rain, and, importantly, the
rain would be undesirable for him/her. The timitive mood would not be used if
the speaker were hoping for rain, such as after a period of drought. Below are
given two more examples of timitive sentences:(18-92)    Ada qoko       mataqi.
           TIM  2SG.SEQ be.sick
           ‘You might be sick.’ (The addressee is showing signs of being sick.)(18-93)    Ada bii                naqi ka      aqi             si

           ‘The food (in the stone oven) may/might not be done yet.’ (Opening
           and closing a stone oven are laborious processes, and the speaker is
           concerned about it being opened prematurely.)    A timitive clause may be preceded by another clause, but the first clause
need not expresses fear about the potential situation of the timitive clause, and
it need not encode a situation that may prevent or counteract it either. For ex-
ample, the preceding clause may express a situation that is seen as potentially
leading to, resulting in, an undesirable situation, expressed in the timitive
clause:(18-94)    Qoe, qe             aqi       qosi    lae     bii nau, uri

shock, reproach, indignation, not necessarily directed at one’s father; see also
section 8.1.2).
   In (18-96) the first clause expresses what may be the symptom of the possi-
ble undesirable situation:(18-96)    Nau ku              feda     qasia naqa, ada          kwa

           be.sick LIM-1SG.PERS
           ‘I feel very tired; I may just be (getting) sick.’   And in (18-97) the first clause expresses the temporal circumstance of the
potential undesirable event:(18-97)    Laalae    qoki    biinga       naqa, ada     qoko    lio-dora
           when      2SG.FUT sleep        PRF    TIM    2SG.SEQ mind-forget           qana kwaqe-mae-li-la-na           laeta.

           to put out the light (so make sure you do put it out).’ ‘When you’re
           about to (go to) sleep, don’t forget to put out the light.’   The distinction between expressions of apprehensional-epistemic meanings
and negative purpose is not always clear cut. The sentence in 18-98) is inter-
pretable either way. The speaker may be relatively less or more certain that the

Interrogatives
19.1.   IntroductionToqabaqita has two basic interrogative sentence types: (a) closed interrogatives
and (b) open interrogatives. The closed-open distinction has been adopted here
from Huddleston (1994: 419): “[c]losed and open interrogatives are characteris-
tically used to express questions where the set of answers is respectively closed
and open”. In Toqabaqita, there are subtypes of interrogatives within both the
closed and the open categories. Also following Huddleston (1994), the term
“interrogative” is used here to designate certain sentence types, whereas the
term “question” is used to designate the central illocutionary force of interroga-
tive sentences, which is to ask for information. In parallel to closed and open
interrogatives (and their subtypes), one can distinguish closed and open ques-
tions (and their subtypes). Although interrogatives are used primarily to ask for
information, they have other functions as well, such as asking for confirmation
or in phatic communion. Different subtypes of interrogatives may be combined
in “complex interrogatives”. And there are also dependent interrogatives that
are complement clauses.","[837, 838, 839, 840, 841, 842, 843]"

           thing.” The man said, “Yes, and the girl, she said I should meet her
           the day after tomorrow”.’
28.2.3. Bii and biaBoth bii and bia are commonly used to coordinate noun phrases (section
11.2.1). There the form bii is used if the coordinand to the right is a pronominal
noun phrase, and bia is used if the coordinand to the right is a lexical noun
phrase. Bii and bia can link clauses, but only under restricted circumstances.
They cannot link sentences, nor can they introduce independent sentences the
way ma can. They can only connect clauses when the relation between the
propositions is simple additiveness, and it is not sequential. They cannot con-
nect clauses when the relation is one of result/consequence or con-
trast/unexpectedness. But even in the additiveness function, bii and bia are
extremely rare.46
   The next two examples show bii and bia, respectively, in their clause-
coordinating function. In the former, bia could be used in place of bii, and in
the latter bii could be used in place of bia. And both forms could be replaced by
ma.","[1015, 1016]"

           ‘You, how manieth now of time you have arrived in the Solo-
           mons?’)
19.3.7. Fei, fania, fana ‘where?’The three interrogative words fei, fania, and fana are all used to inquire about
locations, but the latter two also have one other function (discussed in section
19.3.8). Fei is a locative adverb (section 4.11). It is the commonest locative
interrogative word and occurs in several constructions. Fania and fana are par-
ticles. They are emphatic forms, and their locative use is restricted to one type
of construction.
    It is necessary to distinguish locational-sentence interrogatives and other
interrogatives concerning locations. Locational-sentence interrogatives corre-
spond to locational declaratives (section 26.1), and their function is to ask ques-
tions ‘Where is X?’. They employ the locative verbs nii ‘be located’ or, much
less commonly, ii ‘be located’. Locational-sentence interrogatives are discussed
first, starting with those using fei.
    There are three basic strategies for forming locational-sentence interroga-
tives using fei. In one, both the fei phrase and the locative verb are in situ, with
fei following the verb. No preposition is used with fei. In another strategy fei is
fronted and it is the complement of the locative preposition qi. In the third strat-
egy the locative verb and fei precede the subject. No preposition is used with
fei. The first two examples below contain interrogatives with both the verb and
fei in situ. This type of construction is by no means uncommon and need not
express an echo question.",[872]

            rock this
            ‘Let’s try to move this rock.’ (Lit.: ‘Let’s try moving of this rock.’)    On the other hand, when an attempt to bring a situation about is unsuccess-
luf, ili-toqo takes a finite clause as its complement, and the clause contains the
irrealis marker:(18-10)     Ku            ili-toqo-na   sa        kwai    lafu-a           maqa

            ‘I tried to lift the stone, but (lit.: and) it was too heavy.’ (That is, the
            speaker was not able to lift the stone.)    Similarly, the irrealis marker is used in purpose clauses that express at-
tempted events when the attempt is unsuccessful (see examples [33-42] and
[33-43] in section 33.3.2).
    Complement clauses of the verbs ‘think (that such and such is/was/will be
the case), assume (such and such to be/have been the case)’ also can contain the
irrealis marker. Here too sa signals a relatively low degree of certainty that the
situation in question is or will be the case in non-past contexts, and counterfac-
tuality in the past. Sore-qe (which also means ‘say’), with the detransitivizing
suffix -qe, is one such verb. The clause encoding a possible event is joined to
the sore-qe clause paratactically. Not infrequently, when sore-qe is to be di-
rectly followed by the irrealis marker in the next clause, the two fuse together
                             18.3 Low degree of expectation; counterfactuality   759as so=sa or as so=so. The first example expresses a low degree of certainty
about a potential future event, and the second one counterfactuality in the past:(18-11)    Nau ku              so=so                kwai    lae      qana

           1SG 1SG.NFUT think:DETR=IRR 2SG.NFUT go                    PRF
           ‘I thought you had gone (but now I see you are still here).’   Another verb with the meaning ‘think (that), assume (that)’ is manata-toqo
(often pronounced mantatoqo), a Class 2 transitive verb. The clause that en-
codes the potential event functions as the direct object of manata-toqo. In the
example below, the irrealis marker signals counterfactuality in the past. The
non-occurrence of the event is made explicit in the final clause.","[811, 812]"

occurs in the presence of a future subject marker. This is discussed further be-
low.
   In (15-109) the perfect marker in the negative clause signals not that the
speaker does not expect it ever to be sunny again but that it won’t be sunny in

affairs that has not materialized by the time of reference is still expected to
(possibly) materialize. Compare the next two examples. The perfect marker in
(15-110) signals that the man is no longer expected to come:(15-110)   Wane    baa qe=aqi                si        fula     naqa.

still expected, hoped that he will. There the perfect marker is ungrammatical.","[767, 768]"

           ‘It looks like the people (from) up there may not have gone yet.’   In the hedging/counterfactuality construction just discussed, the verb quri
‘look like’ has as its subject the nominalization of riki ‘look at’. There is an-
other type of construction, also with the verb quri, where quri has no subject,
766    Mood
although it may have a third person singular subject marker that functions im-
personally. However, it is more common for quri to have no subject marker.
Here too the complement of quri is the event clause. This construction usually
expresses either a quite low degree of certainty about the factual status of a
proposition or counterfactuality, in which case the event clause contains the
irrealis marker sa. Quri may be preceded by a topic phrase, which usually, but
not necessarily (see [18-36] further below), corresponds to the subject of the
event clause. The basic structure of this construction is shown in (18-33):(18-33)    (topici/j) (3sg.subject.markeri) quri-a [event.clause]    In (18-34a) quri has the nominalization of riki ‘look at’ as its subject, while
in the synonymous (18-34b) it has no subject. In both sentences thaari naqi
‘this girl’ is the topic that corresponds to the subject of the event clause:(18-34)    a.     Thaari    naqi, riki-la-na           quri-a

has an impersonal subject marker.","[818, 819]"

24.3.    Unrestricted choice expressed by means of mamalana or qatonaThe other type of unrestricted-choice construction is a possessive noun phrase
either with mamalana ‘any one’ or with qatona ‘any one’ as the possessum
nouns. Both nouns are restricted to this construction; they are not used else-
where. Mamalana may historically be a nominalization of a verb *mama, with
the third person singular personal suffix *-na, that is, *mama-la-na, but there is
no evidence of such a verb. Alternatively, mamala may have some historical
connection to the equative preposition mala ‘like, as’ (section 10.2.4), also with
the suffix *-na.44 And it is likely that qatona is historically *qato-na, also with
the third person singular personal suffix *-na. As there is no evidence of mama-
lana or qatona having an internal structure in the present-day language, both
are treated here as unanalyzed wholes.
   Both mamalana and bana are accompanied in the possesum phrase by the
limiter bana (section 7.7.). The basic structure of the construction is given in
(24-6):(24-6)     [mamalana/qatona bana]          [possessor.NP]
           any.one/any.one  LIM    The possessor noun phrase is non-referential. It designates the class of enti-
ties any member of which satisfies the proposition expressed in the clause. The
possessor noun phrase often also contains the indefinite quantifier ta (section
6.8.6), especially if it is qatona that occurs in the possessum phrase.
904      Unrestricted choice
   Although mamalana and qatona occur in the same construction expressing
the same meaning, their uses are not identical. Qatona tends to be used in re-
plies to questions, while mamalana is not normally used in replies.
   Examples (24-7) – (24-11) contain mamalana.","[955, 956, 957]"
