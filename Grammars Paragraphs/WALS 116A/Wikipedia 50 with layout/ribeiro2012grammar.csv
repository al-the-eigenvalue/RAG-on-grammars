       There is one basic negative morpheme in Karajá, -ko); suffixed to the verb, it negatesthe entire sentence (73). It can also occur with the pro-form ♀ ado) ‘thing’ (♂ao)), forming a
negative particle which negates individual constituents of the sentence (74) and also occursin answers to yes/no questions (75b). The negative morpheme, followed by the imperfectiveclitic, can also be used in such circumstances (75c). An emphatic morpheme, hÈkÈ (♂hÈkÈ),
occurs with ado)ko) or a verb to convey a strong negation (75d).(73)   ♂       Î´kI Oha)            ∅-r-I-rOèko)

8.12 Questions
       There are two basic interrogative morphemes in Karajá, èbo and èwE; both seem to
be used interchangeably, though èbo tends to be more common. They combine with the pro-forms ♂ado) (♂ao)) ‘thing’, bo) ‘human’, and ÎI ‘circumstance (time, place, manner)’ to forminterrogative words (76-78). Notice that entire phrases (76d, 78d), referring to the focus of
the question, can be situated between the pro-form and the interrogative clitic.

as a second-position clitic, to situate the focus of the question on specific constituents of the
sentence (80).

8.13 Numerals       Karajá has numeral words (or constructions) for the concepts ‘one’ to ‘twenty’. Fornumerals ‘one’ to ‘five’, there are single words (81). Some of these numerals seem to bemade up of more than one identifiable, albeit fossilized, morpheme, including third personprefix i-, bIkOwa ‘companion’, èdo) ‘indefinite article’ (as suggested by stress and itsbehavior in male speech), and kÈre ‘half’. The use of words such as ‘companion’ with thenumeral ‘four’ is also found in other lowland South American languages (Green 1997), andcould be an areal phenomenon. The numeral ‘five’ could arguably (and rather speculatively)
                                                65
be segmented as i-ru-kÈrE [3-eye-half] ‘the half (of both hands?)’, a descriptive constructionincluding ru ‘eye’, the classifier for ‘round, small things’ such as beans, beads, and coins.","[73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"
"Similarly, all basic-color concepts are basically lexicalized as verbs (TO ‘to be made red’,
                                                218
kura ‘to be made white’, l´bÈ ‘to be made black’). The distribution of the different semantictypes between nouns and verbs constitutes an interesting question to be investigated in thefuture.","[229, 230]"

8. Concluding remarks        The main purpose of this chapter was to describe the female versus male speechdistinctions in Karajá and to outline some of the questions such a phenomenon may pose tohistorical linguistics and sociolinguistics, as well as the implications of such a phenomenonfor the analysis of Karajá phonology and morphology. Although male versus female speechdistinctions are commonly found in the languages of the world, very little is known on howsuch distinctions are brought about historically, how they correlate with other socialinstitutions, and how and why they cease to exist. In this sense, the example of the Karajádialects is particularly interesting, for it provides both a situation in which the distinctions arevigorously preserved and a case in which they seem to have faded away diachronically.","[180, 181]"

extent, an open question, especially regarding nasal vowels. Fortune & Fortune (1963)describe four (as in Table 2 above) and Cavalcante (1992) describes three nasal vowels(treating the nasal low vowel as an allophone of its oral counterpart), while Rodrigues(1999), in a recent survey of the Macro-Jê languages, states that Karajá “has only two nasalvowels, /´)/ and /o)/.” The apparently questionable phonemic status of both /¸)/ and /a)/ is due totheir low frequency. But, as it will be further discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, theirdistribution is not predictable and there is fairly clear evidence of contrast between them andtheir oral counterparts. The schwa, whose phonemic status is also problematic, will bethoroughly discussed in Section 4.2.3.","[97, 98]"
"3.6 Use of female speech by men, and vice-versa         Examples in which the k-dropping rule may or may not apply cannot be confusedwith cases in which a male speaker deliberately uses female speech forms. In fact, as inKoasati (Haas 1964) and Yana (Sapir 1949), female and male speakers can use each other’sspeech forms when ‘impersonating’ a character of the opposite sex, such as when narrating astory or baby-sitting. Thus, if a male speaker is, for example, quoting a female character orbaby-talking to his daughter, he will use plain female speech in doing so.16 Inversely,women will use male speech forms when quoting a male character or baby-talking to a babyboy. The use of female speech by a male speaker is further illustrated by the sentence below,
16
  A very interesting question to be investigated is when and how are the distinctions between female and male
speech learned by the child. According to Fortune & Fortune (1975:115), “at about age three, mothers start
insisting in the Karajá tribe that boys use only men’s speech. This is the beginning of the socialization process
which continues until the adult male is admitted to the men’s house where no young initiate would ever use
women’s speech.” However, the observance of the female-male speech differences in baby-talk suggests that
these distinctions start being acquired much earlier.",[160]

       With a few extended intransitive verbs which take an allative or dative argument,such as ´)k´)raSi ‘to ask’, transitivization results in the promotion of the former obliqueargument to direct object (examples from the Xambioá dialect):(28)   a.      hawÈkÈ          ÎarikOrEkO               r´)k´)raSire

2.3.2 Transitive verbs       Transitive verbs are those that take a direct object as one of their arguments. InKarajá, transitive verbs are always marked by the prefix I-, as shown by the paradigms givenin (7) above. As mentioned above (Section 2.2), transitive and intransitive valence prefixesmay fuse with the preceding personal prefix under certain circumstances, such as in the 2ndperson in the centrifugal direction of the realis mood (29a). Notice that there is no fusion inthe centripetal direction (29b).(29)   a.      ÎErakoÎe                          b.     ÎadIrakoÎe

       There are two allomorphs of the reflexive morpheme, eSi- and iSi-. The former isincorporated into the verb, when the NP coreferential with the subject is a direct object (30a).","[203, 204, 205]"
"2. The ‘Macro-Jê hypothesis’       The Macro-Jê stock comprises the Jê family and a number of possibly relatedlanguage families, most of which are located in Brazil (the exception being Chiquitano,which is also spoken in Bolivia). Macro-Jê is arguably one of the lesser-known language                                              262
groups of South America, its very existence as a genetic unit being still ‘‘a workinghypothesis’’ (Rodrigues 1999: 165). According to Rodrigues (1986, 1999), whoseclassification has been the most widely accepted among researchers working on Brazilianlanguages, the ‘Macro-Jê hypothesis’ comprises 12 different language families: Jê, Kamakã,Maxakalí, Krenák, Purí, Karirí, Yatê, Karajá, Ofayé, Boróro, Guató, and Rikbaktsa. Theexistence of Jê as a language family has been recognized since early classifications of SouthAmerican languages (Martius, 1867). ‘Jê’ is a Portuguese spelling for a Northern Jêcollective morpheme ([je] in Apinajé, for instance) that occurs in the names of several Jê-speaking peoples. The term ‘Macro-Jê’ was coined by Mason (1950), replacing earlier labels,such as ‘Tapuya’ and ‘Tapuya-Je.’       Recent classifications (Rodrigues, 1986; Greenberg, 1987; Kaufman, 1994) differ asto the precise scope of Macro-Jê, although there is agreement on the inclusion of most of thefamilies (Table 1). Except for Karirí (included only by Rodrigues), Greenbergand Kaufman included all the families listed above. In addition, Greenberg includedChiquitano (also included by Kaufman), Jabutí, and Otí. Given the lack of comprehensivecomparative studies, the Macro-Jê status of some of these families is still an open question.","[273, 274]"

9. Table of contents        As I intended to show in this introduction, many aspects of Karajá phonology,morphology, and syntax (as well as its peculiar system of gender deixis) remain to bethoroughly understood. However, even a succinct overview of the language reveals anumber of phenomena rich in theoretical and descriptive implications. It is my hope that thisdissertation will provide us with a better understanding not only of the Karajá language, butalso of the general analytical questions its study raises. The following chapters provide an indepth description of phenomena which are central to the understanding of Karajá.","[77, 78, 79, 80]"

8.3.5.1.1 Causativization       Causative stems derived from unergative verbs, such as rika ‘to walk’, are formedwith the causativizer suffix -d´k´) plus the verbalizer suffix -d´) (53). However, the causativesuffix does not occur in causative stems derived from unaccusative verbs, such as -Uka ‘to becooked’ in (52b) above.

8.3.5.2 Transitive verbs       Transitive verbs are those that take a direct object as one of their arguments. InKarajá, transitive verbs are always marked by the prefix I-. As I mentioned above, bothtransitive and intransitive valence prefixes may fuse with the preceding personal prefix undercertain circumstances, such as in the 2nd person in the centrifugal direction of the realis mood(55a). Notice that there is no fusion in the centripetal direction (55b).(55)   a.      ÎErakoÎe                        b.      ÎadIrakoÎe

8.3.5.2.1 Reflexive       There are two allomorphs of the reflexive morpheme, eSi- and iSi-. The former isincorporated into the verb, when the NP co-referential with the subject is a direct object (56a).","[61, 62, 63]"

       A common characteristic of lowland South American languages is the existence, withnouns, of different degrees of grammatical possession: there are obligatorily-possessed nouns(e.g. body-part terms, for instance), optionally-possessed nouns (e.g cultural items), andnouns which cannot be directly possessed (e.g. items of nature, such as rocks, water, animals,etc.). That is a well-documented phenomenon in several Macro-Jê languages, includingthose of the Boróro, Jê, and Karirí families (Rodrigues 1999:190-192). In the latter case (thatis, items which cannot be directly possessed), generic nouns such as the ones described aboveare used as possessive classifiers in indirect possessive constructions, such as 43 below, fromBoróro (Crowell 1977:178). In Karajá, however, that is not the case, as any noun can inprinciple be directly possessed (wa-idZOrOTa ‘my dog’, etc.).(43)   a.      i-n-ago      kogariga
               1-REL-pet    chicken

               1-REL-thing stone
               ‘my stone’
       Corresponding to possessive verbs such as English have, Karajá presents aconstruction involving the instrumental postposition èdI attached to the indefinite pronounidZo) ‘some, other’ (44a) or to the possessed noun (44b):(44)   a.      ♂       dIar´)        wa-d¸)eru       idZo)è

       b.      ♂       dIar´)              )eruè

                            ‘I have money.’
         While the instrumental postposition is intrinsically unstressed, it is always stressed inconstructions such as the ones above. That is probably another instance of the use of stressshift with subordinating functions (see Chapter 5). This is further illustrated below by aminimal pair (for stress) showing the contrast between the uses of èdI as a postposition (45a)and its use as a possessive predicator (45b):(45)     a.       i-d¸)eruèdI                 [inie""rudI]

                  ‘the one who has money’8.3.3 Subject agreement         Person agreement displays a strictly nominative pattern, with the verb alwaysagreeing with the subject, be it intransitive (46a) or transitive (46b). Person agreementmarkers are distributed into two different sets, one occurring in the realis (present and pasttenses) and the other in the irrealis (future, potential, and admonitory). These prefixes arelisted in Table 12 below.15
15
   The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the
irrealis mood.","[54, 55, 56, 57]"

This analysis is contingent on a revision of the phonemic inventory of Karajá. Contrastingwith the previous phonological descriptions of the language, this analysis points to a largerinventory of vowels in which the feature [ATR] plays a major role (Table 1). The maindifference is that in this analysis, a phonemic opposition is recognized between the high‘tense’ vowels /i/, /È5/, and /u/ and their ‘lax’ counterparts /I/, /È/, and /U/26, as shown by theminimal pairs given below (4). This distinction was not considered in previous works.27(51)    a.       lahi     ‘to curse’                 b.       lahI    ‘grandmother’
        c.       bÈ5      ‘silence’                  d.       bÈ      ‘answer’
e.      -uka     ‘to split’                 f.       -Uka     ‘to be cooked’
Besides the existence of minimal pairs, the phonemic character of the opposition is alsoshown by the fact that lax and tense vowels have quite different behaviors in the processes ofvowel harmony and palatalization. As the examples below demonstrate, the high tensevowels /i/, /È5/, and /u/ and the close-mid vowels /e/, /Ǩ/, and /o/ are dominant28, triggering
vowel harmony, whereas the high lax vowels /I/, /È/, and /U/ do not trigger vowel harmony.","[113, 114]"
"       At any rate, although the regularity of phonological processes remains a major tenetof historical linguistics, there are well-documented cases in which semantic or functionalfactors may interfere with such regularity. A rather illustrative example is provided byGoddard (1991:60), in discussing Cheyenne vis-à-vis Proto-Algonquian:       “Cheyenne […] shows one intriguing development that is not yet explained:
       *p and *k are both dropped, but only, it would seem, optionally; where
       doublets can be compared, the form with retention has a diminutive meaning
       beside the form with loss […]. Such doublets appear to point to the negative
       semantic conditioning of a sound law, surely not a very common type of
       sound change.”",[177]

comparison with Proto-Jê (and other better-known Macro-Jê languages such as Maxakalí),old clusters with an initial voiceless stop were systematically simplified in Karajá (Table 8),losing the initial stop. The process of cluster simplification seems to have affected onlyvoiceless stops (voiced stops were preserved, as illustrated by likely cognate pairs such asProto-Jê *mrOk ‘ash’, Karajá brÈbÈ). Clusters with an initial voiceless stop were laterreintroduced in Karajá through a process of syncope (*k´rO > krO ‘frog’).36Table 6.8. Cluster simplification in Pre-Proto-Karajá

         Correspondences between Proto-Jê and Karajá consonants are fairly well-established,although a few gaps remain. 37 However, for the purposes of the present study, the facts areclear. Concerning the inventory, the crucial facts are those related to the aforementionedgeneralizations about consonant clusters: (a) Karajá /k/, the only voiceless stop in thislanguage, corresponds to Proto-Jê *k (Proto-Jê *ko ‘wood, horn’ :: Karajá kO; Proto-Jê *ku‘to eat’:: Karajá kÈ; also ex. 12 and 13); (b) the voiced stop /b/ in Karajá corresponds toProto-Jê *m (Proto-Jê *ma ‘liver’ :: Karajá ba; Proto-Jê *ma) ‘dative’, Karajá b´); also ex. 1436
   Such syllables can still be considered as underlyingly dissyllabic (/k´.rO/), as demonstrated by their behavior
in processes such as reduplication (which, in Karajá, is sensitive to the number of moras).
37
   For instance, correspondences involving Proto-Jê *N are still unclear. The two likely cognates involving
Proto-Jê *N we have so far happen to be a homophonous pair: Proto-Jê *NrE ‘egg’ :: Karajá TI; Proto-Jê *NrE ‘to
dance, sing’ :: Karajá U-TI ‘to dance’. Here, Karajá /T/ corresponds to Proto-Jê *Nr, and not only *r, contrary to
what Davis suggests (again, Proto-Jê *r corresponds to /r/ in Karajá: Proto-Jê *rE ‘to leave behind’ :: Karajá rI).
So, both *kr and *Nr are reflected in Karajá as /T/. This suggests that both *k and *N merged as /k/ in Karajá,
although the data do not allow a definite answer at this time, since no clear examples illustrating
correspondences with *N in other positions have been identified so far.","[290, 291]"
"         In principle, an alternative, more abstract explanation for the evolution of the suffix*-r into an infix in Karajá could also be proposed, similar to the one suggested by Milizia forthe Proto-Indo-European nasal infixation rule (Milizia 2004). Simply put, the suffix *-rwould have undergone metathesis as a strategy to resolve a constraint against syllable-finalconsonants (*kÈr > *krÈ). This would provide a more straightforward explanation, eliminatingthe need to postulate steps (b), (c), and (d) (Table 10), which could be replaced by one singlerule of metathesis.",[295]
"        The postulation of the female speech as the more conservative one seems to be easilyarguable. The main consideration is predictability: that is, whereas it is generally possible topredict the male form vis-à-vis the female form, the inverse does not occur. There areseveral examples in which sequences of vowels occur both in the female and the malespeech, such as ♀♂ riu ‘hunt’ and ♀♂ UahI ‘medicine’, which makes an alternative rule of k-
insertion unlikely. Considerations of predictability are even more evident in cases wherethere is vowel fusion: in comparing ♀ bEraku ‘river’ with ♂ bero, it is rather clear that the
latter can be derived from the former, but not vice-versa. Loanwords also provide argumentsfor considering the female speech as the less innovative, since borrowings containing a velar                                                 131
stop will have this consonant systematically suppressed in the male speech: kawarU ‘horse’,♂ awarU (from Portuguese cavalo); kUbEÎa ‘blanket’, ♂ UbEÎa (Portuguese coberta); b´)ka
‘mango’, ♂ b´)a (Portuguese manga). On the other hand, there is no insertion of a consonant
in loanwords containing sequences of vowels: d¸)eru [nie""ru] ‘money’ (from Portuguesedinheiro). Morphological considerations also support the postulation of female speech asmore conservative (section 3.2). Finally, in the few cases for which comparative evidence isavailable, the velar stop can be shown to be a retention from the proto-language: Proto-Jê *ko‘wood’ :: kO; Proto-Jê *ku ‘to eat’ :: kÈ.","[142, 143]"
"
       Gender-related speech differences such as the ones found in Karajá (and Koasati(1964), Chiquitano (Falkinger 2002), etc.) can be seen as a matter of gender deixis, in thesense that, as Folley (1997) points out, “some actual linguistic elements are indexicals ofsome fact about gender […]. The choice of a set of forms over the other can be said to pointdirectly to the speaker’s sex.” Throughout this dissertation, the symbols ♀ ‘female’ and ♂
‘male’ will be used to indicate such deitic value of a morpheme. Since forms such as kai andÎ´kI can be used by both male and female speakers, they are left unmarked.",[37]
"        Purpose clauses are constructed with the postposition èb´) attached to verbs in thefuture or potential. This is probably an extension of the use of this postposition to indicatedestination (see 2.6 above).20(55)    i-ha)wÈÈèO idZoi           a-r-a-dÈèk´re

         There are reasons to believe that Southern and Northern Karajá are, with respect tothe existence of the schwa, the most conservative dialects.17 The alternative would be toconsider the scenario occurring in Javaé and Xambioá as the most conservative, postulatingfor Southern and Northern Karajá a rule of lenition of an unstressed vowel when followed bya syllable containing an identical vowel. However, this hypothesis is ruled out by the17
  That is probably a different conclusion from the one reached by the Fortunes. Although they do not discuss
dialectal differences such as the ones illustrated above, their decision concerning Karajá orthography suggests
that they consider Javaé and Xambioá to be more conservative. The schwa is not represented in the common
orthography adopted for the four dialects. Thus, morphemes such as Î´ka ‘to tie’ and Îaka ‘to take off’ (a
minimal pair in Karajá, but a homophonous pair in Xambioá) are not distinguished orthographically in any of
the dialects.",[104]

        The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionallydefine an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, andproductivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11). The existence ofdirection as an inflectional category seems to be a fairly rare phenomenon. Talmy(1985:135), for example, in a survey of grammatical categories, states categorically thatdirection “is not marked inflectionally.” According to Bybee, this would be due to its lack oflexical generality:      By definition, an inflectional category must be applicable to all stems of the appropriate semantic
      and syntactic category and must obligatorily occur in the appropriate syntactic context. In order
      for a morphological process to be so general, it must have only minimal semantic content. If a
      semantic element has high content, i.e. is very specific, it simply will not be applicable to a large
      number of stems. [Bybee 1985:16-17]
      That is, since the category of direction would in principle be relevant only for motionverbs, it would not apply to a sufficient number of verbs to constitute an inflectionalcategory. Thus, besides being commonly expressed lexically such as in Portuguese levar ‘totake away’ versus trazer ‘to bring’ and English come versus go, and by clitics, direction isalso found expressed derivationally, such as in Latin eo¤ ‘I go’, ex-eo¤ ‘I go out’, trans-eo¤ ‘I goacross.’ However, as Bybee (op. cit., 17) observes, “each of these prefixes has a limited                                                      175
lexical applicability, for they are only appropriately added to verbs indicating motion of somesort. Their semantic content prevents them from meeting one of the criteria for inflectionalstatus.”","[185, 186, 187]"

dialects. The alternative would be to consider the scenario occurring in Javaé and Xambioá
as the most conservative, postulating for Southern and Northern Karajá a rule of lenition of
an unstressed vowel when followed by a syllable containing an identical vowel. However,
this hypothesis is ruled out by the existence, in Southern and Northern Karajá, of minimal
pairs such as Îaka [Îa""ka] ‘to take off’ versus Î´ka [Î´""ka] ‘to tie’ (corresponding to a
homophonous pair in Xambioá), as well as bOrO [bO""rO] ‘stingray’ versus b´rO [brO] ‘back’
(corresponding to a homophonous pair in both Javaé and Xambioá). As will be seen, the
facts of the male-female speech distinction also argue in favor of the hypothesis that the
schwa can be reconstructed for Proto-Karajá.
           Another phonological process that differentiates Javaé and Xambioá from Southern
and Northern Karajá is the palatalization, in the latter, of the velar stop /k/ when following
the [high, front, +ATR] vowel /i/.2 As will be shown, the resulting affricate, [tS], will still
behave as /k/ in relation to the process of k-dropping.","[140, 141]"

Thus, in the examples below, the prefix r- indicates that the eventis seen as occurring away from the current location of the speaker (centrifugal direction),32

       As I mentioned above, another difference is the occurrence, in the Northern andSouthern Karajá dialects, of surface CCV syllables, resulting from a process of syncope of aschwa occurring between a stop and the alveolar approximant /r/ (in male speech, this schwamay surface due to the rule of k-dropping: ♂ ´rO ‘frog’, ´rE ‘kingfisher’).

  These semantic characterizations are approximations. For the concepts of figure and path adopted here, see
Talmy (1985:129), who defines figure as “the salient moving or stationary object in a motion event” and path as
a category which “refers to the variety of paths followed, or sites occupied, by the Figure object.”

  Although the range of meanings displayed by some of the Karajá pospositions may at first seem unusual, it is
very easy to find parallels in other, well-known languages such as English or Portuguese. The use of locative
postpositions with temporal purposes (as a metaphorical extension from location in space to location in time),
                                                     226
name, think and tell (that is, the complements denoting that which is said, heard, thought,asked, or told) are also marked by the postposition èb´) (15). As we will see, this semanticdiversity accounts for the use of this postposition to mark both purpose clauses and converbs,as well as sentential complements of verbs such as say, tell, etc.6(11)     ♂        wa-oworuèb´)          a-r-∅-aèkre

                  ‘My friends call me Kawina.’for example, is a rather common phenomenon. Even more idiosyncratic uses of postpositions (as non-canonical
markers of what would be translated as direct objects in English) may also reflect cross-linguistic tendencies.
As Jespersen (1965:159) points out, verbs for ‘to throw’ take objects marked as instrumentals in many
languages, including Old Norse. The use of a locative posposition to mark the object of a verb such as ♀ rakuSi
‘to eat’ (♂ roSi) is paralleled in English by the use of on in constructions such as deer feed on grass or the
castaway lived on coconuts for weeks.
6
  This apparent diversity of meanings could be due not to polysemy, but to homophony (that is, instead of these
being instances of different meanings associated with a single postposition, it could be the case that there would
be different postpositions with the same phonological shape). However, the fact that a postposition such as èb´)
presents the same irregular allomorphy in all the uses mentioned above seems to rule out the hypothesis of
accidental similarity.","[236, 237, 238]"
"Thus, in the short text presented here, ‘The Hawk and the Snake’ (16), the hawk is initiallychosen as the deictic center, as shown by the opposition between the verb forms robière‘he/she saw (thither),’ in Line D, and dobiède ‘he/she saw (hither),’ in Line E. Notice that atthis point the hawk is flying in the sky. The choice of ‘sky’ as opposed to ‘ground’ is notexactly what one would expect if a purely anthropocentric perspective were adopted.",[194]
"Another minimal pair, ra¸)èra ‘I stood up’ (35b) vs. raièra ‘I laid down’ (36b), can beexplained morphologically as the result of the deletion of the nasal vowel in the root -´)i ‘tostand up’ and the transference of the nasality to the stressed vowel:1210
    With some loans, different forms may coexist, varying as to the degree of adaptation. That is the case of the
Portuguese loan for ‘bread’ (Portuguese pão). The form [ma""o)] is said to be used only by those with little or no
knowledge of Portuguese; the less adapted forms [ba""o)] or even [pa""o)] are more commonly used.

    The word for ‘mosquito’, a)h¸), is probably of onomatopoeic origin. Another onomatopoeic word containing
/¸)/ is [s¸)""ka], the name of a bad-omen bird.
12
    Another example of nasal stability under vowel deletion, also involving the nasal mid-central vowel /´)/,
occurs with the root h´) ‘to be’, when it is prefixed with the 1st person prefix wa- (cf. (a) below; for additional
details on this root, which becomes grammaticalized as a habitual marker, see Chapter 5). Thus, there is yet
another (superficial) minimal pair for the contrast between /a/ and /a)/: wahaèr-e ‘(he) is my father’ [wa""hare]

            Note that the environments in which /¸)/ occurs are the same as the ones in which /a)/occurs: that is, onsetless syllables, after the glottal fricative /h/ and after voiced stops.","[101, 102]"
"23
  It is interesting to notice the contrast between forms such as (46b) and those containing the intransitive
marker a-; although the phonological environment would be presumably the same, the intransitive form is
hEÎE. This suggests that object markers have a more ‘intimate’ relationship with the verb stem than inflectional
prefixes such as the intransitive marker (even if, on the surface, they seem to be occurring in the ‘same’
position). A similar state of affairs—the fact that palatalization is restricted to certain prefixes (equivalent to
Lexical Phonology’s level 1 affixes)—is discussed below.",[110]
"
       Likewise, the preservation of /k/ in Karajá female speech could be seen as the resultof a negative sociolinguistic conditioning of a sound law—again, “not a very common typeof sound change”. The synchronic variations in the degree to which k-deletion takes place,coupled with its productive application even to recent loanwords, are in themselves veryenlightening, demonstrating how a phonological rule gains a life of its own once it is investedwith a sociolinguistic function.",[177]
"8.2.2 Stress       The position of the stress is predictable: in general, it falls on the last syllable of the(isolated) word (10). However, ‘minimal pairs’ for stress can appear in a phrasal level, a factwhich is due to the contrast between intrinsically stressed and unstressed words (11).",[41]
"         Also, if consonant clusters involving voiced stops were indeed preserved in Karajá,one should be able to find cases in which the nominalizer has been preserved after /b/. That,in fact, also happens: the nominal form corresponding to the Karajá verb -bU ‘to cry’ is -brU(cf. Meb. muw ‘to cry’, nominal form muw-r; also compare example 18 in Table 9). Casessuch as *par ‘foot’ :: Karajá wa, where lenition seems to have prevented the creation of anenvironment for cluster formation, provide clues on the relative chronology of thephonological processes postulated herein (*p-lenition must have preceded clusterformation).403.4.1 Residual examples: h-replacement         There are a few verb stems for which, instead of /k/, it is /h/ that is replaced by /r/ inthe nominal form (Table 11). Except for hO ‘to wash’, 41 all of these stems present, after theglottal fricative, a front vowel. Thus, it is possible that such cases represent originalinstances in which *k preceded a front vowel. The velar stop would have undergone a
1992:95). The final consonant was apparently reinterpreted as a suffix in the other branches of the Jê family,
Central and Northern Jê, where the nominalizer –r is still productive.
40
   One should not assume, however, that lenition took place simultaneously for *p and *t. As the survival of *k
demonstrates, different consonants (although belonging to the same “natural class”) may behave differently in
processes such as this (and the same applies to cluster simplification). Lenition of *p and *t and cluster
simplification can both be seen as instances of the same tendency (a Sapirian “drift,” if we will) to weaken
voiceless stops (fully consolidated in pre-consonantal position, but only half-way so in pre-vocalic position).
As for the “preservation” of *k in Karajá, that is only half the story, as we have seen in Chapter 3.
41
   Clear correspondences in Jê for Karajá /h/ have not yet been found. /h/ could have derived historically from a
stop (for instance, */); that would provide an explanation for its behavior, in terms of consonantal replacement,
with the stem hO ‘to wash’.",[294]
"5. Adverbial clauses        Karajá apparently has few, if any, true adverbial clauses, a fact that mirrors theoverall lack of adverbs in the language.19 Corresponding to locative adverbs (‘here’, ‘there’,‘hither’, ‘thither’) and temporal adverbs (‘yesterday’, ‘tomorrow’), Karajá has demonstrativepronouns (ka ‘proximal’, k´da) ‘distal’) followed by postpositions (kaèkI ‘here’; ♀ kaèku, ♂
kaèu ‘yesterday’; ♀ k´da)èku, ♂ k´da)èu ‘the day before yesterday; the day after tomorrow’).",[253]
"       In this introduction, I provide background information on the language and itsspeakers: Section 2 describes the geographic location of the Karajá-speaking tribes; Section 3discusses the language’s genetic affiliation; Section 4 describes contacts with speakers ofdifferent languages; Section 5 offers a brief appraisal of previous scholarship on Karajálanguage and culture; Section 6 describes basic dialectal differences; Section 7 brieflydiscusses the circumstances surrounding the collection and elicitation of the data on whichthe present dissertation is based. The introduction concludes with a brief grammatical sketchof the language (Section 8) and a narrative table of contents (Section 9).",[13]
"           Macro-Jê is, to a certain extent, reminiscent of North America’s Algic, in the sensethat, in both cases, there is a close-knit, well-established family (Algoquian; Jê, in our case)and a number of distantly-related families or isolates (Wiyot and Yurok; Karajá, Ofayé, andseveral others, in our case). A major difference is that there is even more internal diversity inMacro-Jê, suggesting that it is even older than Algic. If, as Goddard (1991:64) states,“Algonquian, Wiyot, and Yurok form a genetic grouping that is at, or very close to, themaximum depth at which it is possible to reconstruct features of the protolanguage that retainany appreciable degree of resolution,” Macro-Jê may provide an even fuzzier picture. For
29
     Similar objections against Dixon & Aikhenvald’s claims are raised by Voort (2004:213).",[278]
"The linking prefix has two allomorphs whose choice does not seem to be conditionedsynchronically: d- (d-EbO ‘hand’, d-o)ho) ‘pet’, etc.) and l- (l-OÎI ‘throat’, l-UahI ‘medicine’,etc.). The function of this prefix is synchronically fairly opaque, but its distributionresembles that of the so-called relational prefixes, linking morphemes described for otherMacro-Jê languages (Rodrigues 2000), as well as languages from the Tupí stock and theKaríb family (Rodrigues 2009). As discussed in Chapter 5, the occurrence of such linkingprefixes in Karajá may provide further evidence for its inclusion in the Macro-Jê stock.",[53]
"5.4.2 A case of grammaticalization       In addition to the posture verbs listed above, another common auxiliary-likeconstruction involves the stem h´), which can be translated as ‘to be’, which takes thenominal series of prefixes. Notice that the stem undergoes total harmony (or vowel copy) inthe first (wa-ha)èr-e ‘I am’) and and second persons (a)-ha)èÎ-e ‘you are’), but not in the thirdperson (i-h´)èr-e ‘he is’).

       Constructions such as (78) above seem to have been the source for the ratherproductive habitual construction illustrated by examples (79) below. Both constructions                                               251

         The constructions above are common to both the Northern Karajá and Xambioádialects. In Southern Karajá (78) and Javaé,25 on the other hand, grammaticalization went astep further, with the generalization of the third-person form, èb´)h´), to all persons:

  The contrast in the degree of grammaticalization of the habitual marker demonstrates the descriptive
usefulness of distinguishing between Southern and Northern Karajá, despite the fact that they are traditionally
seen as one single dialect. Considering the traditional situation of contact between the Javaé and Southern

         The development of the habitual marker in Karajá provides an interesting case-studyin which every step in the grammaticalization process can still be witnessed synchronically,both in terms of internal reconstruction and interdialectal comparison. It is a compellingexample of the usefulness of a pan-dialectal analysis, even in cases in which the dialectaldifferences may, at first sight, be considered too shallow to yield any descriptive insight.","[262, 263, 264]"
"       The study of some morphophonemic alternations also corroborates the analysissuggested above. Thus, the nominalizer suffix -TV (where V stands for a vowel identical tothe last vowel in the verb root) is palatalized when attached to a verb root ending in the highfront [+ATR] vowel /i/, but not after its [-ATR] counterpart /I/:(84)   Verb            Noun

         One of the sources of tS in Southern and Northern Karajá is the palatalization of thevelar stop /k/ after the [high, +ATR] vowel /i/, a process that does not occur in Javaé andXambioá (86).

"5.5 Postpositions as discourse connectors        Reflecting their use with adverbial clauses, third-person forms of adpositions are usedas discourse connectors (corresponding to conjunctions in languages such as English andPortuguese): Îai ‘therefore, because of that’, idI ‘then, after that’, etc.",[265]
"This is illustrated below (Table 10) by the Karajá root kÈ ‘to eat’ (nominal form rÈ), a likelycognate of Proto-Jê *ku (nominal form *ku-r)Table 6.10. From suffix to “replacive infix”

         If the description provided here is correct, we should be able to find elsewhere(besides those examples involving suffixation of the nominalizer) additional cases in whichfinal *r came to be in prevocalic position. That is indeed the case: the Karajá cognate of theJê verb root *kÈr ‘to call, to bellow’39 is rÈ, displaying exactly the same correspondences
39
  In this case, the final /r/ is indeed part of the stem, as suggested by Southern Jê (Xokléng kÈl ‘to shout out, to
cry’; Urban 1985:177), where the nominalizer *-r does not occur (cf. also Maxakalí cat ‘to call’; Pereira

       Whereas the i-class prefix series distinguishes a reflexive third person (Îa-) from anon-reflexive one (i-), the Î-class series has only one third person prefix (Î-), which coversthe range of meanings of both reflexive and non-reflexive third persons. Furthermore, the Î-class stem -EbO ‘hand’ presents a prefix d- in the first person and when preceded by anominal possessor. The function of this prefix is synchronically fairly opaque, but itsdistribution resembles that of relational prefixes, linking prefixes which have been describedfor several other Macro-Jê families. Relational prefixes were first described as agrammatical peculiarity of Tupí-Guaraní languages, and their occurrence in languages ofKaríb and Macro-Jê stocks, as well as in languages of other branches within the Tupí stock,has been pointed out as evidence for a genetic relationship among these three groups(Rodrigues 1994). Such linking prefixes are very likely cognates with similar morphemes inJê and other families within Macro-Jê (Ribeiro 2004, 2005b, 2011) and provide furthercorroboration for the inclusion of Karajá in the Macro-Jê stock (see Chapter 6).","[216, 217]"

         The root h´tSi ‘bottom’ (44b) is particularly instructive. The glottal fricative /h/behaves as a ‘transparent’ consonant, allowing total harmony to take place just as withonsetless syllables. Therefore, when h´tSi follows another root in a compound, the schwaassimilates the features of the last vowel in the preceding root (45). Interestingly enough,compounds such as bErahatSi ‘river bottom’ are common to all dialects, demonstrating that a‘harmonizing’ form (that is, a form containing a schwa) must have already been present inthe proto-language.22(45)     bEra-h´tSi                 [bEraha""tSi]

  The variation in the [ATR] value of the high vowel in this stem is not a systematic difference between Javaé
and the other dialects. Other examples of sporadic differences of this type are dIkar´) ‘I’ (in Southern Karajá)
versus dZikar´), kÈla ‘smalll’ versus kÈ5dZa.
22
   That is probably the origin of the interesting pattern of morphophonemic alternations
found with the ‘augmentative’ morpheme, whose first vowel is always a copy of the last
vowel in the preceding root (see below). The difference is that the ‘augmentative’ morpheme
is a bound root, occurring always as the second element in a compound. Therefore, an
underlying, schwa-preserving form is not found in surface representation. Stems such as
h´tSi, on the other hand, although obligatorily possessed, are morphologically independent,
and may be found without any preceding morphological element.♀        a.       bEraku-huk´) [bEraÆkuhu""k´)] b.              Îakida)-ha)k´) [ÎakiÆnaha)""k´)]

         A similar example involves the root h´23ÎE ‘hit’, which generally falls into the overallpattern of correspondence. However, while its basic form in Xambioá is, expectedly, hEÎE(46a), it also occurs as haÎE when preceded by the incorporated object pronouns of first andsecond persons, wa- (46) and a-. That is, corresponding to a single form in Karajá proper,Xambioá has two forms: hEÎE and haÎE. Again, the postulation of a schwa in the proto-language provides a more straightforward explanation for the existence of multiple reflexesin Xambioá.(46)     a.       ∅-r-I-∅-hEÎE-d´)èr-a      [rIhE""ÎEn´)ra]

                  ‘he hit me’
         Finally, examples involving the nasalization of /b/ and /d/ also seem to corroboratethe need for postulating the existence of a schwa in the proto-language. As we have seen, aform such as -d´k´) [d´k´)] ‘causative’ (Xambioá and Javaé -d´k´) [n´)""k´)]) may occur withoutthe velar stop in male speech. As a consequence of k-deletion, the schwa assimilates all thefeatures of the following vowel (-d´´) > -d´)´)), but the consonant remains oral: [d´)""´)].","[108, 109, 110]"

   I am using the terms [+ATR]/[-ATR] and tense/lax more or less interchangeably here. Noske (1995) finds
“the [+ATR] and [-ATR] vowels of Turkana auditorily quite close to the tense and lax vowels of English and
German.” I would say the same at least with respect to the front vowels /i/ and /I/ of Karajá, which sound to me
similar to the vowels in beat and bit, respectively, but, as Noske noted for Turkana, without the length
distinction occurring in the English examples. The mid vowels resemble the ones of Portuguese. An acoustic
analysis of the Karajá vowels is still to be done, though.
27
   In fact, Fortune & Fortune (1963) include /U/ as a phoneme in their initial description of Karajá phonology.
However, more recent works, such as Fortune (1973), do not mention it. Although this phoneme was initially
represented in Fortune’s Karajá orthography, it was not used in more recent published works, such as the latest
version of the New Testament (1983) and literacy materials. After I started discussing the distinction between
[-ATR] and [+ATR] vowels with the Karajá speakers, they decided to use of the letter <ù> to represent /U/ (the
same letter initially adopted by the Fortunes).

"        The evitative postposition indicates what is to be avoided or feared, marking theoblique complements of verbs such as -UbErU ‘to be freightened’ (4) and wO ‘to hide’.3 Anexample of the temporal postposition (‘when’) is given in (5) below. Besides indicatingsource (‘from’), the ablative postposition marks objects of comparison (6).(4)     ♂        wa-riOrE       Îorièèlau       ∅-r-∅-UbErUèr-ErI

  A good example of the problem posed by the translation of adpositions is the preposition by in English, which
has instrumental (he went by train), locative (he is by the fountain), and temporal (I’ll be back by midnight)
uses, among others. The criteria to determine the ‘basic’ meaning of postpositions may be fairly arbitrary. In
labeling the Karajá pospositions, I took into consideration what seems to be their more general, productive, and
non-idiomatic uses (as far as possible).

  Kariri, a Macro-Jê language remotely related to Karajá, also has an evitative postposition (Mamiani 1877:77).
According to Blake (1994: 156), evitative (also called ‘aversive’) case markers are also common in Australian
languages.",[236]

        Besides the scarcity of data on some of its now-extinct members, such as thelanguages belonging to the Purí and Kamakã families, Macro-Jê comparative studies run intoproblems that typically plague long-range comparativists: roots are generally isolating andmonosyllabic, and syllabic patterns are rather simple. Since most likely cognates tend to beof the CV type, there is a greater risk of accidental similarities. That risk is particularlyincreased by an apparent neglect to abide by the comparative method when proposingcognates. A case in point is the work of Aryon Rodrigues, a major Brazilian scholar, oncomparative Macro-Jê linguistics. Besides adding little to the cognate sets already identifiedby previous authors (Guérios, Loukotka), Rodrigues’ cognate inventories (Rodrigues 1999,Rodrigues & Cabral 2007) illustrate primary methodological mistakes, including an obviouscase of borrowing (the word for ‘maize’, which is likely of Arawák origin; cf. Ribeiro 2010)and assigning cognate words to wrong cognate sets--for instance, Kaingáng krE) ‘egg’ isconsidered a cognate of the word for ‘egg’ in other Jê languages, which trace back to Proto-Jê *NrE, even though (as Davis had already demonstrated) Kaingáng preserved Proto-Jê *N as/N/; Kaingáng krE) traces back to Proto-Jê kra ‘offspring’ instead. As examples such as thisillustrate, little attention is given to phonological regularity, even in the case of a fairly well-established family as Jê. Rodrigues’ main contribution to comparative Macro-Jê studies wasthe detection of shared morphological similarities which are likely due to commoninheritance (Rodrigues 1992, 2000b; Ribeiro 2011). Particularly relevant for Karajá are theso-called “relational prefixes”, linking morphemes discussed in Section 3.2 below (cf.","[276, 277]"
"The first wave of Kaiapó migrants were the ancestors of the present-day Xikrin, who wouldhave migrated in the first decades of the 19th century (Vidal 1977). Marching west, theywould establish peaceful contacts with the northernmost Karajá-speaking group, the

Xambioá. As a result of such contacts, the Kaiapó borrowed a number of cultural elements(with their terminology) from Xambioá. The linguistic loans include not only terms referringto items of material and ceremonial culture, but possibly even a relationship term, bikwa‘relative’ (< Karajá bIkOwa ‘friend, companion’, ♂ bIOwa). Additional waves of Kaiapó
would progressively migrate west, this time mostly through Northern Karajá territory, and farfrom peacefully (I have recorded, among the Northern Karajá of Santana do Araguaia,narratives of such conflicts). While some of these late migrants would end up beingcatechized by the missionaries and absorbed into the regional population, disappearing as anethnic group, most continued their migration towards west, ending up as far away as theXingu River. Currently, no Kaiapó-speaking groups live near the Araguaia.","[23, 24]"

Fortune 1963, Cavalcante 1992), my own analysis points to a larger system of vowels, in
which the feature [ATR] ‘advanced tongue root’ plays a major role (Ribeiro 2000). The main
difference is that I recognize a phonemic opposition between the high [+ATR] vowels /i/, /È5/,
and /u/ and their [-ATR] counterparts /I/, /È/, and /U/, a distinction not mentioned in the
previous works. This distinction has pervasive consequences for the understanding of Karajá
morphophonemics. Besides the existence of minimal pairs (for example, lahi ‘to curse’ vs.
lahI ‘grandmother’, and -uka ‘to split’ vs. -Uka ‘to cook’), the phonemic character of the
opposition is also shown by the fact that [-ATR] and [+ATR] high vowels have exactly
inverse behaviors in the processes of vowel harmony (2.4) and palatalization (2.5).",[38]
