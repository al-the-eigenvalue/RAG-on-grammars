The affix rda-, on the other hand, indicates that the subject participant's motion is directedaway from here (where I am) or away from this place (I speak of).
The affix na- is the more specific of the two orientation specifiers. Like demonstrative
forms nguya(bba) ‘here’ and +kara ‘this one here' the locational aspect of na- is specific
because of reference to a specific entity, namely the speaker. The non-specific locational
nature of ‘there’ (not near speaker) is lexicalized in Nakkara,            where four different
demonstratives stems can answer the question “But where there?"" (see 3.3.3.). Similarly,
direction of motion away from the speaker, coded by rda-, provides less specific
information about the location of the referent. This generality of reference leads, oddly
enough, to restrictions on the occurrence of the affix rda- (outlined below). NPs outside theverb-complex can always be used to clarify a goal of motion or location of participants.","[263, 264]"

The particle mukkawa ‘maybe’, perhaps’ can either stand alone as a response expressing
indefiniteness, or can occur with (usually preceding) a clause or NP to suggest some doubtor lack of information about a proposition; sometimes mukkawa is used in posing a

These forms are usually used as interrogatives requesting more information about thenature of an object or a reason why something happens or doesn't happen. They can
occasionally be found expressing indefiniteness, as in (54). The examples following best
capture the function of these formative phrases. Note firstly however that liyawa '3Minimal Oblique’ (=of/to it) is often shortened to liya and secondly that both nangarda
 liya(wa) and nangardawa liya(wa) occur. I have not always been able to distinguish separate meanings for these two forms (which indeed are sometimes interchangeable)

"Since the publication of Glasgows' article on geminate stops in 1967 many linguistsworking in the area have agreed that the distinction perceived is one of quantity rather thanquality, but McKay's 1980 spectographic study provided the first evidence for this, fromwhich he concluded:     ‘A comparison of lengths of occlusion for the geminate and single (fortis and lenis)
     stops shows clearly that the geminate (fortis) stops are considerably longer than the
     single (lenis) stops.' (McKay, 1980:346)
 In spite of this clarification of the phonetic factors involved in stop contrast, the terms fortis' and ‘lenis’ are still frequently used, either as terminological descriptions of the two
 series or as additional features to characterise the distinction. Where the terms ‘fortis’ and
‘lenis’ are not further qualified we must assume that they are used to suggest a perceivedcontrast of articulatory force. A paper by Jeri Jaeger investigates these factors. Titled ‘TheFortis/lenis question: Evidence from Zapotec and Jawofi’, she states:‘Although these terms [fortis/lenis] are used frequently, and numerous attempts have been
made to define and substantiate their phonetic content, linguists continue to disagree on the
interpretation or validity of such evidence, and not all linguists are convinced that the
phonetic distinction indicated by these terms exists at all.' Jaeger, 1983:1)
The data from Jawoii, a language of south-west Arnhem Land (data collected by FrancescaMerlan) is particularly relevant, since the Jawofi stop series and alternation parallels thesituation found in Nakkara.","[36, 37]"

commitment to the factive outcome of the proposition than mukkawa ‘may/might' or
ngawa. ‘maybe'. Nevertheless, the degree of possibility indicated by djawa is not fixed and                                                    336

djarra(bba) ‘should’ and the potential particle ngamarramung. Unlike mukkawa and ngawa,
djawa does not function as an interjection, and does not occur
                                                               in isolation. The particle
djawa commonly occurs with conditionals and counterfactuals where it

It differs from most otherlanguages in the area in that there is no segmental (or prosodic) glottal stop. In this respectNakkara and the two neighbouring languages, Ndjébbana (Kunibidji) and Burarra form asmail enclave of languages without a glottal stop.

7.2. Interrogatives         and   Indefinites
It is possible to cite Nakkara equivalents to a full set of English WH-interrogatives, such as
who?, what?, when?, where?, why?, but this gives an incomplete picture of the function of
these words. Some occurrences of these forms are both interrogative and indefinite, and
others are one or the other. Most interrogative forms have a range of meanings, which are dependent on context. The Interrogative and indefinite forms recorded to date in Nakkara are tabled in 7.2. below.",[319]
"
 It remains to be seen just how many Australian languages employ some form of the verb. ‘get’ in Inchoative constructions.We can cite at this point, Nunggubuyu (Heath (1984:396- 397))    and    Hughes    and       Healey    (1971:55-56)),      Burarra   (Glasgow   (pers.comm.)), Gunwinygu (Carroll (1976)), (Oates (1964:41,62)) and the Papuan language Alamblak (Bruce (1984:151)).
 There are just three other clear examples of nominal+maya (rather than +miya).and only one of these is an inchoative verb (see (86). The other two are nominal forms and have a Semblative meaning, as in (87) and (88). Occurrence of maya as a semblative suffix is not productive, though there may be additional examples that I have not yet encountered. The other ways of forming semblative phrases in Nakkara are by using the particle djabba ‘like’ or -djiddjabbawabba ‘exactly the same as' (see 7.2.3.1.) or -burdandjiya 'be same as' (=lit: hit+RECIP) (see 7.2.3.1.)

verb ending in the syllable ma have an underlying ‘get’ in its semantic structure? Do allverbs with ka       (from the root ‘take’) involve ‘take’, or ‘the hand’ as instrument? Theanswer to both questions is of course no. Not all verbs can be decomposed in this way.
“Some verbs, however, seem to support the hypothesis. This subject will be dealt with more fully outside this thesis in subsequent papers on word-formation in Nakkara.","[281, 282, 283, 284]"
"The function of ngarra is to introduce new information. It can serve to highlight a change

"2.4.1.   Stop   Alternations     in NakkaraStop alternation occurs most commonly across the morpheme boundary of prefix andverbal or nominal root. Specifically, a word-initial stop, which is always short, occurs as a
long stop when forced by a prefix to occupy word-medial position. Alternation of this type
or similar has been documented for other languages in the Arnhem Land area (cf. Waters1983 for Djinang, McKay 1984 for Ndjébbana) but it is not nearly as productive a processin either of these other languages.
2.4.1.1. Stop     Alternations     in Verbs        and   NominalsLengthening of a word-medial morpheme-initial stop is a common process in Nakkara and

  morphemes is: can we establish an underlying form? Given the previous
                                                                                  for the
  environments for neutralisation of stop length we can assume that this accounts
                                                                                       the
  short stops in word-initial position in ib), iib) and iiib). This might suggest that      underlying form is that found in word-medial position. Along these lines of argument the
      underlying form of the verb root ‘to hit’ would be /b:uda/ and ‘to get up' /g:aramoa/, while
      the underlying nominal stem in iii) would be /g:eyada/, that is, all would have an initial long      stop. Nevertheless, the existence of a similar phenomenon in the major type of reduplicated
      word-form militates against this proposition. Consider the examples of reduplication type A
      listed under (2) below:
      (2)     i               ‘garagarawab:a                      ‘all along’

                              na+gara-gara              iii)            n'badabada                          ‘Barramundi’
                              n+bada-bada               iv)            na'g:eragera                        ‘Sand Crab’
                              na+gera-gera               v)             na'g:obagoba                        ‘Ghost Crab’
                              na+goba-goba                  vi)         _—sna'g:uyaguya                     ‘thief’
                              na+guya-guya
Focusing particularly on examples (2) i) and ii) we see the same type of alternation as in (1)above. If, by analogy, the underlying form of the reduplicated morpheme segment has aninitial long stop, we would expect the underlying form to be reduplicated. Instead, thesecond occurrence of the segment consistently shows a short stop. We can thereforeassume that in alternations such as these the underlying stop phoneme is short. There arecoincident factors involved in stop alternation in Nakkara, (e.g stress patterning) but the .regularity and productiveness of the process in this language means that it can be accountedfor in terms of the morpheme boundary alone, as in the following rule:                               CG                                    CG
         o-              —                  [vi            _        |X  {i.e. a consonantal stop segment is created post-vocalically, identical to the following root-initial stop.]Note in this regard that primary stress co-occurs with the initial syllable of the root
morpheme. In fact, in my earlier analyses of Nakkara phonology, primary stress was put forward as the conditioning factor for stop alternation. In neighbouring Ndjébbana where the alternation is not as productive, primary stress placement is used as an appropriate conditioning factor for stop length alternation. (cf. McKay (1984).) 2.4.1.2. Stop      Length      at Nominal        Stem     and Suffix Boundary There are are far fewer nominal suffixes in Nakkara than there are prefixes. Moreover, less than a handful of these are stop-initial. There is one possessive pronoun paradigm, the unmarked forms of which occur as nominal suffixes, (see 4.6. for discussion). Only one suffixal form within the paradigm is stop-initial; with the addition of three remaining nominal suffixes, one of which is /b:a/, the total number of stop-initial suffixes rises to four.","[50, 51, 52]"
"1 These three salient alternatives have been well summarised
                                                                and considered (for Yolngu languages only) in
a valuable document by Wood (1978). This provides a good
                                                         basis for the continuing debate on stop
contrast.
The phonetic factors which distinguish stops in Nakkara are examined closely. Closureduration is shown to be the salient factor involved in the distinction. This conclusion leads
to a more natural statement of distributional constraints. These constraints point to anddraw on the important analogy between long stops and consonant clusters. This analogyprovides strong support for a geminate interpretation of unpredictable long stops.","[35, 36]"

                                                                   s. These strings of adjacent particles
  can sometimes be glossed as a composite of their literal
                                                           meanings, and sometimes not.
  When, for example the negative Particle korla occurs with
                                                             ngarra, as korla ngarra the
  combination means ‘not even’ as in (100) and (101).
                                                      The function of ngarra        to introduce
  new, Contrastive or unexpected information is implicit
                                                         in the gloss ‘even’ in this composite.
 (Compare here the use of 'even' with a negative in English
                                                                : ‘didn't even telephone, let
 alone write.') So too in Nakkara, ngarra is used to invite
                                                               contrast, or where something

 Korla ngarra differs from korla yabba           and korla bardakka'still not, ‘not yet’ (see 7.3.3.4.
- and 7.3.3.5.) in that a verb following the latter construction

  form. Interestingly, this is not a necessary requirement for
                                                               a verb following korla ngarra ,

"The following sections explain the nature and implementation of contrasting stops inNakkara. Firstly, in section 2.3.1, the phonetic nature of the contrast is explored. The most
appropriate phonetic characterisation of the contrast is established after considering threealternatives, a fortis/lenis opposition, a voiceless/voiced opposition and an opposition ofclosure duration. Duration is established as the principal phonetic factor and two alternative
directions emerge for phonological analysis of the stop contrast.",[35]

    Although occurrences of ngamarramung with affirmative irrealis (i.e. future) verbal clauses    are possible, in all examples I have, ngamarramung is always qualified by a preceding    djawa ‘could be' in these circumstances. The composite construction djawa ngamarramung    means ‘should be able’ or ‘supposed to be’. An example follows:

It only occurs with irrealisy negative verb    forms with second person subjects (A) or (S) and always precedes the verb form (V). It     means ‘stop V-ing' or ‘never/don't ever V'. As far as I know it cannot be used to modify     any other word class (i.e. apart from a verb) and it never occurs as part of a composite of     particles. The restriction to second person subject means that mungana is associated with
     negative verb forms that are used as negative Imperative constructions (see also 5.4.2.3.),     but, like the standard negative particle korla it does not actually occur with an Imperative
     verb form. (Only the negative Imperative particle yingawa ‘don't’ occurs with Imperative     verb forms.) Restriction to irrealisy negative verb forms means that only Contemporary and
     Future negative verb forms occur (i.e. C/T NEG and FUT NEG) with mungana. Examples
     of mungana occurring with both an intransitive and a transitive verb follow:                                                        344

" As mentioned above, the term Progressive is used here in a rather general sense, meaning ‘to be involved in the process of doing’. Usually the English gloss ‘is/was V-ing' is appropriate for these aspectual constructions, but sometimes the idea of an associated process suggests alternative glosses. For example, verbs of inert perception like na ‘see’ and kelaya ‘hear' can occur with progressive aspect (usually ni 'sit'), and as such mean ‘watch' and 'listen' respectively, as in the following: (84)   Nganaya nganinda kordakkarddanga balmarnindja.        nga       +na    -ya         nga     +nin                  -da

When we look at structures where the core participants are not coreferential we begin to see
some of the constructions where partial coreferentiality surfaces, and possible subdivisionsemerge. In (106) for example we see simple peripheral coordination between three VCs,but the translation to English of the relation between the second and third VC requiresrelativisation.   Similarly, in (108)        and (109)    we see verbal complements   that in otherlanguages usually require some degree of embedding or reduction.
Partial coreferentiality has most scope where one or both of the verbs invoived in the nexus
is transitive. In these circumstances the transitive object of one verb may be coreferential
with the subject of another and it is no longer just subject coreferentiality at issue. Withintransitive-intransitve constructions a different kind of partial coreferentiality emerges.
Although the core participants are not coreferential, the set of participants involved in thetwo actions can be identical, as in the following example where the subject of the first
clause is ‘she and I' (1UAf) and the subject plus Oblique of the second clause form thesame set. (IUAf = 1M + 3Mf).",[439]

 The set of human status terms that occur with an Attributive prefix also includes terms for
 ‘female with child/ren’, ‘second born’, ‘older sibling’, ‘younger sibling’, ‘old person’, ‘unmarried person’, ‘female’ and ‘uncircumcised male’. Other status terms such as
 ‘circumcised male', ‘cripple’, ‘male/masculine’ and alternative terms for ‘old man/woman’.and ‘infant’ are uninflected forms or take non-Attributive inflections.
It was mentioned in 4.5.1.1. above that the only nominal forms that never occur with the Attributive prefix are derived nouns formed with the prefix /na-/. There are two important exceptions to this generalisation and as kin-terms these words for ‘woman’, ‘female’ and
 ‘man’, 'male' are discussed here. The         singular forms   are nawara and nakaddjara
 respectively. Non-singular forms use the Attributive prefix only after deletion of the derivational prefix na+, as in kabarrwara ‘two women’, ngurrba(wa)ra ‘all us women’, kabanakaddjara ‘two men’, nurrbakaddjara ‘all you men’.
 The kin terms referred to in this section are not the common vocative terms heard in
 everyday speech. Vocative and many other descriptive kin terms occur with alternative
 inflections. The set of kin terms that occur with an Attributive inflection denote specific reciprocal relationship pairs, like ‘mother and child’. They are in this sense dyadic kin terms, There are only seven dyadic forms and they are used for reference to classificatory
 as well as for real or blood relations. These dyadic kin terms form a closed set and are used ‘to define all kin relations within the classificatory system of subsections used by Nakkara
 ‘people.
 Dyadic terms can be used instead of referring to the entities separately. A simple example is
 use of the term which describes the relationship between Mother (and Mother's sibling/s) and child, Instead of (27), one can use the dyadic form, as in (28):

or more negative
(could you)? where a negative form of the verb is used to make the request less direct and
therefore more polite. A polite request in Nakkara can however occur without the particle
yarrkka or any other overt mood particle but still in the negative mood.
Occurrences of yarrkka in texts all involve irrealisy negative verb forms. I have also been

able to elicit yarrkka with irrealisy negatives, and in these cases yarrkka

 nicely captured by use of ‘should’ rather than ‘could’ in the translation).","[368, 369]"

Another morphophonemic change to the intransitive verb root occurs when the root-final
syllable is /ndja/ and a Reciprocal affix is added. This change occurs in the two verbs
“exemplified below and is similar to the deletion of /nja/ in bobanja ‘blow’ in example (62)
above. When the final syllable of a verb root is /ndja/ or /nja/ (and the root has three or |more syllables) the final syllable is deleted with addition of the Reciprocal affix -ndjiya- .

 An alternative interpretation of this deletion process is that the Reciprocal form is
  [ROOT+ ya] and there is no deletion. Although this is possible I have chosen the deletion  alternative for two reasons. Firstly, use of the affix -ndjiya- (rather than -ya-) for a
  Reciprocal verb complies with the standard function of this affix. Secondly, there is already
  a precedent for deleting one of two identical consecutive syllables (see 2.6.3.1. /ba/-
  Deletion Rule M-2 and 2.6.4. YM-1).","[276, 277]"

                 verb forms from monosyllabic roots is quite straightforward for all
 transitive monosyllabic verbs; the PC/T or C/T tense suffix is simply added to the
‘ monosyllabic root. The root syllable then carries the primary stress.
 Formation of irrealis;
                   verb forms (i.e. affirmative future and PC/T negatives (see 5.4.1.1.
 and 5.4.1.2. )) is standard for verbs i) to iii) only. It is normal for PC/T negative forms to
 use the same stem as affirmative future forms. However for verbs iv) to vii) the C/T realis stem compound is used for formation of PC/T negative stems rather than the affirmative future stem.
 For v) djo ‘scold’ an irregular stem kuya replaces the monosyllabic root in affirmative
 future forms. For vi) ka ‘take’ the affirmative future form takes an increment dji giving an
 extended root djika with stress on the increment syllable.
 Formation of Minimal Imperative forms from monosyllabic roots is quite straightforward
  for most of the transitive monosyllabic roots. For verbs i) to iv) the Minimal Imperative
  form (where (O) = 3MIN) is the monosyllabic root alone, as in ma! ‘get it!', rda! ‘spear it!""  etc.","[250, 251]"
" When occurring alone with a verb, naka ‘after'/‘later’ is a temporal support for future verb
 forms only, as in naka ngaybbara Til eat it later’ (where it can also follow the verb). It can
 also be used without tense restrictions to specify the reference of other time qualifiers, such
 as baraka naka “later in the evening’, naka barakabba ‘later tomorrow’, in fact wherever the
 semantic range of the collocation allows.",[310]

usually indicates that the person or thing coded by the prefix is characterised by the quality,

   As in English, descriptive words can be used in Nakkara to compartmentalise the day. The

   morphological forms that refer to parts of the day.",[304]
"The term ""progressive"" is used in a rather general sense here to mean ‘involved in theprocess of doing’. It is used rather like an encoder of broad imperfective aspect, to suggestthat the internal temporal constituency of the action involved a process, took some length oftime from beginning to end. Progressive aspect is syntactically marked by the addition of afully inflected stative existential verb. The internal semantics of the stative existential verbsinclude a sense 'to stay' as well as ‘be’, ‘be at' and ‘sit’, ‘stand’, ‘lie’. It is this sense(‘stay’) that seems to underlie its use as a progressive auxiliary.",[426]
" There is no straightforward criteria for division of verb roots into the various conjugation
 sets. In the following discussion we look at both phonological and semantic criteria.
 Although never entirely predictable, we find that the phonological shape of a verb root (specifically the initial consonant of the final syllable) provides a clue to conjugation membership. The table of conjugations for verbs in Nakkara follows.

7.1.1.2.   Spatial   ParameterAlthough there are no units of measured distance in Nakkara, there are some spatial
qualifiers which give more or less specific parameters of horizontal separation and distance.
The morphologically simple forms recorded to date are included in Table 7.1.1.2.a. The
 three basic forms of this set are belamabba ‘close’, ‘closer’, kunarawa ‘middle distance’, ‘further’ and nakkarrakarra ‘tong way’, ‘far away’.
 Demonstrative adverbs (see Table 7.1.1.a. above) also provide parameters of separation
 and distance, so in this sense they can be appended to the set tabled in 7.1.1.2.a. below.
 There are also expressions in Nakkara which are equivalent to ‘on/to/from this side’ and
 ‘on/to/from the other side’ which incorporate variations of demonstrative adverbs plus the de-transitivised form of the verb belbba ‘step’, ‘spread’. This verb belbbaya means
 something like ‘spread self out’ and has limited usage as an expression of spatial
 parameter. These expressions are tabled in 7.1.1.2.b. below:                                                  278
