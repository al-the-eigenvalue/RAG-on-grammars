"12.5.3. Yawe 'yes'The affirmative yawe is used either to answer a question posed by someone else, or (as
also in English) to create a cohesive link within the text of a single speaker, by signalling
that the text is about to proceed. Examples of both kinds follow. In the first, yawe is used
within the text of a single speaker to represent a response in a narrated speech situation.
In this segment of text, narrated by Elsie Raymond, she represents her grandmother as
telling her a story of an early massacre; and herself, as listener many years ago, asking
""Is that right?"", to which her grandmother replies, ""Yes"".(835) yin.gun-bu-ndi-ya           dan-ganung-ba                galul

   E        ""Is that right?""
   G:     ""Yes. Later, when you get big you tell them the story now'"".
  The second kind of function is not ""response"" either in the immediate speech situation
or in a narrated one, but is a way in which the speaker carries the narrative flow forward
and creates cohesion within the text.(836) 0-yanggi           lurrbu    bordordob        0-gengnu-yi-rri     na

My thorough-going obligation to Wardaman people of Katherine, Northern Territory, as
well as my debt to some researchers who studied languages of this area before me, is
described in 1.5 of the following grammar. Here I would like to acknowledge support
for the funding of my research, and my gratitude to fellow researchers.
  My first period of research in Katherine, from 1976 to 1979, during which I did
considerable work with Wardaman people, was funded by the Australian Institute of
Aboriginal Studies, now the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Studies, Canberra. I am particularly grateful to Warwick Dix for having overseen many
aspects of field support.
  In 1988 and 1989,1 was invited by Josephine Flood, then at the Australian Heritage
Commission, to take part in interdisciplinary research on Aboriginal sites of Willeroo,
Delamere and Innesvale Stations. Permission to visit those properties became easier to
obtain in the late 1980s than it had been before. As a result, I was able to expand my
familiarity with Wardaman country considerably. I was able to visit not only rock art
sites (the focus of research by archaeologists) but also many other Wardaman sites of
significance which I had been learning about for some years from Wardaman people.
  For discussion of Australian languages and many other matters over the years, I would
like to especially acknowledge Paul Black, Jeffrey Heath, Pat McConvell, David Nash,
and Alan Rumsey. I am indebted to Georg Bossong for his useful editorial suggestions
on an earlier draft of this manuscript, especially for his comments on analysis of the
pronominal categories (Chaptero), and his encouragement to expand the analysis of word
order (Chapter 10). Lorraine Garland, Mark Harvey, Stephen Roberts, and Karen
Westmacott were invaluable assistants in the preparation of this manuscript. My thanks
also to the Cartography section of the Department of Geography at the University of
Sydney for preparation of maps.

                                      Chapter 1
                                     Introduction
1.1. Wardaman today: The language and its speakers Wardaman is a non-Pama Nyungan language of the upper, inland Northern Territory of
Australia. It is now one of the most widely spoken Aboriginal languages of Katherine, a
rapidly-growing1 town of about 8000 people located on the Stuart Highway in the upper
third of the Northern Territory (Map 1). Though Wardaman is more widely known than
some of the other languages of the general Katherine area, the number of active speakers
is relatively small. I estimate there are 30 people aged 40 and above who live in and
around Katherine, and regularly speak Wardaman in some of their interactions with each
other. They do not speak only Wardaman to each other and to other Aboriginal people
with whom they live, but also use north Australian Kriol (see Sandefur 1979) and other
Aboriginal languages.
  Additionally, there is a much larger number of people — possibly numbering as many
as two hundred — with and around whom those active speakers live, and in many cases,
have lived for a long period of time, who understand Wardaman and consider hearing it
spoken around them a regular feature of their lives. Many of these additional people are
close family of the ""core"" speakers, children, grandchildren, and others. Some others,
however, tend to be more distantly related ""countrymen"" of the Wardaman — people
who identify with tribal groupings of Victoria and Daly Rivers and the larger region west
and south of Katherine, contiguous with what the Wardaman regard as their traditional
territory. These countrymen include people who are identified as Jaminjung, Yangman
and Mudbura, among other tribal groupings. Many of these people have been in the
Katherine area for a long time, and some are married to Wardaman. Additional
countrymen from the Victoria River hinterland, who identify with tribal groupings
including Ngarinyman, Nungali and Ngaliwurru, often visit the Katherine camps and
houses where Wardaman people live when they come in to town. (See Map 2 showing
approximate territorial association of the tribal groupings mentioned). Some of the older
countrymen not only understand Wardaman, but can speak it, even if they do not do so
as often as the Wardaman core speakers.
  Younger Wardaman people — in my observation, including at least everyone born after
the Second World War — do not speak the language actively, but use at most the
occasional word and phrase. Varying with family, however, some of these younger
people have a good understanding of the language. Due to the particular circumstances
1. The town had continued to grow steadily but slowly until 1986, when the recommissioning of
a RAAF base east of the town, Tindal. was the impetus for the rapid near-doubling of the town's
population. Under these conditions, and despite considerable Aboriginal movement into the town
in the 1960s. 1970s, and 1980s, there has been diminution of the proportion of the town's people
who are Aborigines.
2 Chapter 1under which many Wardaman have lived for the last few decades (see 1.4.), many
younger people of certain families have had a great deal of influential exposure to
Wardaman, and have a rather full, passive knowledge of the language which apparently
might, under some conditions, be convertible into active speakership.
  Thus active use of Wardaman is more closely associated with age among Victoria River
and allied ""countrymen"" than it is simply with social identification as Wardaman.
Tendency to use the language, however, seems to be strongly correlated both with age
and with recognition of Wardaman as one's ""own"" language (see Sutton 1978).
  Wardaman people now mainly live around and in Katherine town, although some
people who either identify themselves as Wardaman, or consider that identity a major
component of their family background, live on stations and in other places in the Victoria
River region (including Killarney, Kildurk, and Bulla Stations, Wave Hill, and Yarralin).
  Wardaman are concentrated at two camps outside of Katherine, to the south and west,
towards their traditional country. These are Binjara (Bunjarri\ a community on
Manbulloo Station about 12 kms. from Katherine on the Victoria Highway; and The
Rockhole, about 10 kms outside of town on the Fiorina Road (see Map 3). Increasingly,
some Wardaman people occupy houses in the town, and some people move back and
forth between the camps outside of town, and relatives' houses in town, with one or the
other locale being the normal residence and the other a place where they may spend
shorter periods, a day or perhaps a few days at a time. Wardaman is spoken at Binjara,
Rockhole, and in the town at Wardaman-occupied houses and in the course of activity
(e.g., shopping) in town. Given the close proximity of the two major camps, one or
(usually) more vehicles will commute between them and the town, once or (often) more
times per day. Visiting among Wardaman in and around town is very frequent, and a
major daily activity for many.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"12.4.1. (Tag) question: AleThere is a question element ale (see Cook 1987:93 for the form ngale in Wakiman) which
is usually final in relation to what is questioned, and thus usually a ""tag"" question marker.
In general, it follows a statement of some kind, and, in the same speaking ""turn"", directs
the addressee to confirm or deny the correctness of the speaker's statement. However, it
may be used not by the original speaker, but in a different turn, to question whether what
the speaker said is correct, and in this usage it is thus not a ""tag"", but a more independent
question element (see example (828) in 12.5.3.). It may follow a positive or negative
statement, but tends to occur after the former; positive statements followed by request
for confirmation are more common than negative ones. It may be glossed 'is that right?'
or'is that so'?
  In the first example below, ale is used text-internally. That is, it is not a request for
confirmation directed by the speaker to another person sitting with us in the immediate
320 Chapter 12
speech situation at the time the material was recorded, but rather a question directed by
the speaker of the narrated speech situation, a European policeman, to an Aboriginal
woman, the speaker's sister. The story being told to me by the speaker and another
woman, in turns, was about how European policeman used to come check up whether
there were any part-Aboriginal children living in camps, and if there were, they used to
remove them to institutions. A policeman came to check up, and found a part-Aboriginal
child in the speaker's family.(816) yinyigben        0-nyanga-ndi              0-na-rri

8.20. Copula verbs
  Two finite verbs function as copulas, jingi- and yu-. The former is also a full lexical
verb ""sit"" (and may also occur with particle duba in this meaning). In many instances
copular kinds of constructions in Wardaman do not involve the use of any finite verb.
                                                                Categories of the finite verb 213For example, as noted in 5.7., semantically adjectival nominate may occur with article
suffix forming complements, the subject of which is understood from the pronominal
adjunct of a proximate finite verb:(512)   wudu-wi                   nganburr-ga-ndi...
        little-ABS-ART            3NSG/lSG-take-PST
        'When I was little they took me ...'
  The verb yu- is less common tYianjingi-, both in predications of being and existence
(in a place), and in particle plus verb combinations. This is related to its being defective.
As noted in 8.16., it has only present tense form yu- and non-past subordinate form
yungga, forms ofjingi- occurring elsewhere. It also has a reduplicative present tense
form, yuju-. Besides serving (rarely) as copula, yu-, is also found as supporting verb in
a number of particle plus finite verb combinations. Any particle which may occur with
yu- may also occur withy wg/-, although certain particles (see below) preferentially occur
with yu- in the Present tense. In a few combinations with particle it seems that the verb
may sometimes express the meaning of ""lie"", or (with inanimate clausal subjects) ""be on
the ground"", but this semantic element is certainly not evident in many combinations.
  Particles with which yu- has been recorded in combination include: geleng 'shine, be
shiny'; lirrngang-ma 'smile, laugh'; mengmeng-ma 'be an expanse, spread out, cover,
be in flower' (typically used of expanses of water or flat plains, and in the last sense of
plants); mirrng-ma 'have a headache'; ngarralang-ma 'stand poised, with paws up';
ngidgid-ba 'whimper'; \varrba 'rest'; word-bo, 'sit with head out, only head visible';
narrangarl-ma 'protrude, stick up';juba 'be deaf; gunurd-ba 'be glad'.
  (513) illustrates the non-past subordinate form of yu- in copular function:(513) ngayi-jingi-n               marrany-(y)a         marranyin           ya-0-yungga

                    Other aspects of word formation
9.1. Introduction: Historical layersThere remain a few significant aspects of word, and mainly nominal, morphology to be
discussed in this chapter. Some of these are isolated, or attested in only a few forms (like
the prefix nya-, see 9.6.), and may be assumed to be remnants of old processes of word
formation, now fairly marginal. Others, however, like nominal formation with the suffix
•ban ~ -man, are not only clearly old, but were thorough-going in the language, as the
large number of relatable forms attests.
9.2. -ban ~ -war/, adjectival suffixA nominal-forming suffix of reasonably frequent occurrence is -ban ~ -wan, which is
attested suffixed both to verb particles/adverbs and to nominals, creating derived forms
which are either semantically adjectival, and/or characterized by perfective passive
meaning. This ending is only moderately productive.
  Some forms with this suffix include: burrgburrg-bari 'piebald, spotted'; nyabnyab-
(b)ari 'sticky' (from nyab); walig-bari 'around, all around' (from adverbial walig
'around'); gorlorlogba-wari 'straight' (related to gorlorlogba 'straight'); gun.garr-wari
'what type?' 'what kind?' (cf. gun.garr-ma, 7.5.5.); derrema-wari 'crawling, crawler'
from the particle derre-ma; and yarralma-wari 'untidy, unkempt' (related to particle
yarralma, 'stand up, be unkempt, untidy').
  Sometimes the suffix derives a form of a different word class from the base form, e.g.,
nyabnyab-(b)ari 'sticky' is derived from particle nyab-(b)a 'to stick to'; and yarralma-
wari 'unkempt' from particle yarralma 'to be unkempt'. However, sometimes
suffixation does not clearly result in a change in word class, e.g., compare:(517a)    walig         yanja               gunya              ye-0-geng-ma
          around        3SG-go-PRES         3SG-DISS           3-3SG-fear-PRES(517b)    walig-bari              yanja               gunya              ye-0-geng-ma
          around-NOM              3SG-go-PRES         3SG-DISS           3-3SG-fear-PRES
         'He's going around away from him, he fears him'.
  In such instances there is little clear ground for describing the suffix as ""nominalizing""
(or indeed, as ""derivational""), since the resulting form has the same possibilities of
occurrence as the base form. Note also gorlorlogban 'straight' and gorlorlogba-wari
'straight' are equally descriptors. There is seemingly a difference in syntactic flexibility
of regular nominal constructions as compared to these: those with -ban ~ -wari are not
216 Chapter 9commonly attested with case suffocation (although inquiry reveals that informants
consider case-suffixed forms of them acceptable).
  The subtly more nominal character of gun.garr-wari as compared togun.garr-nia may
be appreciated from the fact that the latter may be used to question the manner of action,
""how?"". It may, however, also be used to ask about the nature of something, e.g.,
gun.garr-im tmdin 'what's the word?' 'what's the news?' etc. Gun.garr-wari, on the
other hand, is used only as adnominal interrogative:(518)   gej-ba        nga-gi-ndi        nuilurru
        ask-PS        1SG-AUX-PST       old woman-ABS
        barnagbarnang         gun.garr-wari           nwgulu

        gaba gaba nyanga jurd-ba            nga-bu-wa        yinggi

        Ί asked the old lady
        ""Auntie? What sort of thing is niagitlu?""
        ""Here here come, I'll show you"" '.
  Two different kinds of textual occurrences of -ban are worth citing to further illustrate
its functional range. In a text about bushlore, the speaker is describing plants which
Aborigines used to collect and use for fish poisons. Allative forms of ""here"" and ""that
way"" are found suffixed as follows:(519)   menjen         nianda-gan          geler ruga
        [plant]        what-Q              [plant]
        dann-rlan-bari
        here-AI^NGM
        dawu-rlan-bari            gelerrnga
        that way-AUy-NOM          [plant]
        'Barringtonia and what's-it Strychnos
         towards this way
          and that way Strychnos'.
  Here, -ban seems to make more concrete the notion of a region or area in the direction
indicated, and thus a nominalizing sort of value.
  In another text the speaker talks of evil glances, or ""evil eye"", which might keep a
pregnant woman from delivering her child easily and in good time. She describes such
a woman as follows:(520) yi-birrba     bangbun        nana
      YI-old-ABS    woman-ABS      that-ABS
      burruga-wun-bari     gayawun-bi
      long ago-NOM-NOM while-AKT
        ' That is an ""old"" woman [' old' =one pregnant for a time already]
          a long-term one, still a while [to go] ...'.
                                                            Other aspects of word formation 217
  Here the suffix occurs on burruga-, which usually occurs with article suffix as
burruga-wi in the meaning 'a long time ago, a long while, long before'. Although
seemingly essentially adverbial, burruga- is here suffixed with what looks like
nominal-forming -gim ~-wun (see 9.4.), but which may also be analyzed as a reduced
form of the Source case ending - wunba, which has been contracted with the ending -ban,
producing a form meaning 'a long-term (person)'.
  Examples of this suffix with v ;rb particles, which show the perfective passive semantic
most clearly, include: iromdog-ba 'split, halve, cut', dog-bari 'halved, split one'; from
bag-ba 'break', bag-ban 'broten one'; from dorlb-(b)a 'drop', dorlb-(b)ari 'dropped
one'; from dulyurr-nm' break, Irnrst', diilyurrma-wari' burst one'. From nominals, note
also the following derivations: from wengman 'empty', wengnian-bari 'emptied, empty,
having been emptied5; iromja.nam 'fuu',jamam-bari 'full, filled one'; and related to
both verb particle jubad 'be diaf' and adjectival nominal yi-jubad 'deaf', jubad-bari
'deaf, deafened one'. Such derived forms do not occur with nominal class prefixes
(though they are, as noted abo\ e, acceptable with case endings). They tend to occur in
absolutive form, for example:(521)   dog-ban          nganu-wo-n
        split-NOM        2NSG/lSG-give-PRES
        ' Give me the halved ons/give me that bit'.
93. -man ~ -ban, nominal-forming suffixThere are many nominals in Wiirdaman that have a final syllable -man or -ban, which is
discussed in 11.1.2., and seems to be relatable to the particle suffix -ba ~ -ma. This
suggestion is supported by the fact that from a considerable number of particles, nominals
can be derived by the additio:i of the noun-forming -n (the same element which is
commonly deleted in final syllable reduction, see 3.4.): for example, from particle
bilili-nra 'be slippery' is derivei the nominal bililiman 'slippery', and so forth.
  This seems indicative of forner, highly productive derivational processes in which
many roots could variably function as verb particles, or as nominals, the former
seemingly morphologically basic. In the contemporary language, however, there are
large numbers of nominals ending in -ntan or -ban that cannot be related to any verb
particle. It is possible that corresponding verb particles, or at least some, may have
formerly existed but have dropped out of the lexicon, and that along with this went the
thorough installation in the hinguage of -man ~ -ban as part of an historical, but
decreasingly productive, structure of nominal formatioa
  The suffix -man ~ -ban occirs as part of the nominal suffix -gujban - -wujban (see
11.3.1.), but there is a clear encugh semantic contrast between the former and the latter.
The latter suffix is very produc live especially with a large range of finite verb roots and
verb particles in the formation of agentive nominals, i.e., ones that generally designate
""agent that does X"", where X is an activity (e.g., bu-yi-wujban 'fighter' from bit-;
nyerreng-ma-wujban 'noise-maker' from nyerreng-ma 'make noise', and so on). In
218 Chapter 9 contrast, the former suffix is found in all sorts of nominal stems which designate either
 non-agentive substantives, conditions, and the like (dalbirrman 'tough, hard', goyogban
  Orphan', langman 'plain, clear place', wujaban 'house', megerrman 'long yam',
 ngigilman 'straight, wabulman 'light-weight', etc.); or occurs in a large range of animal
 and other natural species terms. Some of the latter are clearly onomatopoetic, but the
 character of the formation, in contrast to that with -gujban ~ -wujban, seems not agentive
 but rather descriptive of inherent quality or characteristic (which may include typical
 noise or sound made). Among such forms are: nilngman 'finch', gorrgorrman
 'kookaburra', jerrman 'wrens', jibilyuman 'whistle duck', jorrerrngman 'kingfisher',
jorlborrman 'butcher bird'. See however also: burariman 'bluetongue' (dry country);
 gurrbljlnman 'python'; and even gangman 'plains kangaroo', where natural species
 terms are clearly not imitative. There is as yet no sustainable etymology for the suffix
 -gujban ~ -wujban.
   A more complete listing of nominals with this ending includes: ngarraban 'hot';
 ngirringirriban 'greedy'; ngunagban Odiferous'; nidban, insect similar to cicada;
 nyorijban, unidentified bird; goyogban Orphan'; warrgban 'ubiquitous, promiscuous,
 all over the place'; welejban 'parrot'; (mu)-wudban 'wet ground'; wujaban 'house,
 humpy'; ylberrgoban 'pigeon-toed'; derreman ' c r a w l e r ' ; belejejeman, small
 grasshopper; belyengman 'red'; berlerlman 'kerosene tree'; bilangman 'sweet';
 bilillman 'slipper'; meleman 'black'; burariman, central blue-tongue; dalbirrman 'hard,
 tough'; darlarlman 'sated, satisfied'; demdetnan 'locust'; denggerrengman 'empty';
gangman 'plains kangaroo'; gelegeleman 'frightened'; gerregerrewuman, unidentified
 bird; gorrgorrman 'kookaburra'; gurrbijinman 'children's python';jajayman 'weak';
jamunyman 'pertaining to mother's father's country'; jerrman 'wrens'; jeyeman
 'promised spouse'-Jibilyuman 'whistleduck';jorlborrman 'butcherbird'; jorrerrngman
 'kingfisher';jurlman 'pocket'; langman 'plain, clear place'; megerrman 'long yam';
 worroman 'quick, fast'; newerrman 'hungry'; ngaringgirrman 'round, circular';
ngigilman 'straight'; nilngman 'finch'; nyilirrman One who ignores or pays no
attention'; wabulman 'light'; yaniman 'that sort'; yi-jumban 'last'; and the forms
dan.nguguwunman, nan.nguguwunman 'from this side, that side', etc.
9.4. -gun ~ -wun, nominal suffixAlso clearly old, and now only moderately productive, is the suffix -gun ~ -wun. Now,
this seems to mainly serve to create semantically adjectival nominals meaning
""pertaining to X"", e.g., laglan 'country, place' and yi-lagla-wun 'indigene, belonging to
place'; wungij 'darkness, night' and yi-wungij-gun 'pertaining to night, nocturnal,
belonging to darkness'; mernden 'ghost, white person' and mernde-wun 'European,
pertaining to ghosts'; ngurruwun 'hot weather' and ngurruwun-gun 'perennial' (of water,
i.e., lasting through the hot season). Less commonly, a suffix perhaps relatable to this
one been found with a small number (3) of verb particles with particle suffix, to create a
derived form which also functions as particle, and which is not distributionally or
semantically clearly distinguishable from the base particle form; see examples following.
                                                                Other aspects of word formation 219
  This suffix is found used with certain common nouns which designate social categories,
to create kinds of gentilic formations. For example, one of the matrifiliatively-
transmitted ngurlu categories (see 1.3.) is goyln 'sugar bag', or 'wild honey'. In the text
Galapin a woman speaks of hjr affiliation with this category, creating with the suffix
under discussion a form meaning ""belonging to/affiliated with honey"", as follows:(522) yi-guyu-wunba                 nganu                goyin                yani-tna
      YI-mother-SOU                  ISO-DAT             honey-ABS            thus-PS
      yi-goyi-wun              yirntg
      YI-honey-NOM             1E:CNSG-ABS
        'From my mother, I an ι honey, like this
         we are honey people'.
   Forms with this suffix may be further case- and adverbially-inflected, viz. in the text
 Galapin the phrase mad-bar ""a mernde-\vun-barra 'in/by means of the European
 mernde-wun) language (madin)', with adverbial suffix -barra (see 5.4.).
   There is some indication of the antiquity of this suffix in the language, in the fact, for
 example, thatthe 'lacking' suffix wagbawun (5.3.2.) is evidently to be analyzed as wagba,
 which by itself means Orphan', or 'trash' (discarded etc.), plus this ending. Also the
 adverb and interjection gayanun 'still, yet, wait' etc. (see 9.5.1.) is composed of gaya
 'today, now' plus this suffix. Finally, a reasonable argument can be made that the
 independent genitive pronoun series contains a suffix which may be historically
 identified with the one under discussion here, viz. the relation between 1SG DAT nganu
 and 1SG GEN nganinggin, 2SG DAT yinggi and 2SG GEN yinggawun, 3SG DAT gunga
 and 3SG GEN gungan.gin, and so on. The fact that many pronouns of the independent
 genitive series have final -gin, that is with a high vowel not to be explained in terms of
 any synchronic assimilatory process, suggests that in some functions the suffix is quite
 old in the language.
   Some nominal forms which are not productive derivations, but with final syllable which
 may be relatable to this suffix, include: yi/maAvu-bujgun 'wild, undomesticated';
 dan.guyugun, nan.guyugun 'this side, that side' etc.; dilygun 'possum'; wu-jarranggun
 'pinky finger'; ma-dulgun 'bladder' (cf. dulgin 'urine'); buruwun 'killer, good hunter';
jurdbawun 'index finger' (cf.Jurd-ba, particle 'to indicate'); miyiwun 'dog'; muruwun
 'bottle tree'; wangguwarlawun 'eastern' (cf. yiyanggu 'east'); andyi-nimgajamayawun
 'last of a litter, runt' (cf. yi-nim^yo 'last-born'). It may even be the case that, historically,
 the negative ngawun contains this suffix.
    The verb particles found siffixed with -gun were: new-ma 'grab', as new-ma-gun;
gurryu-ma 'dive in', asgurryu -ma-gun; and wabirl 'peel, skin,graze' as wabirl-ma-gun.
Note that there is some proble n identifying this suffix with the nominal adjectival one,
 in that following a vowel we would expect the form of the ending to be -wun. It must
therefore be suggested that the ending found with these verb particles cannot be identified
 synchronically with the alternating ending, but it may be an historically specialized form
of it, and may in fact be relatable to that found with lege One' to create the
 morphologically irregular or isolated form lege-gun Once' (see 7.6.5.). Textual examples
of the suffixed verb particles are:
220 Chapter 9

        'My father dived in for [to get] him'.
9.5. -mayin, adjectival suffixAn adjectival ending, -mayin, is attested in the word morrolng-mayin 'green, fresh
(green)'. While this ending is thus rare in Wardaman, it is of some comparative interest,
in that it occurs in other regional languages, e.g., Mangarrayi, as a suffix to cognate colour
terms (and also, in the latter language, with some other descriptive terms). Thus in
Wardaman we find belyeng-man 'red', in Mangarrayi be lye ng-may in; in Wardaman
dewo-man 'white', and in Mangarrayi dewo-mayin, 'white'.
9.6. nya-, actor prefixA few forms meaning ""one characterized by X"" or ""one who does X"" are found to be
derived from verb particles with a prefix nya-. Though fairly uncommon in Wardaman,
this prefix may very likely prove of historical-comparative interest in languages of the
region. The base and derived forms in which this prefix is attested are listed below:
Base            Gloss              Derived                         Glossgiwurrg         'be sulky'        nya-giwurrg             'sulky person, one who sulks'
ginod           'be sulky'        nya-ginod               'sulky person, one who sulks'
ganjayl         'disturb'         nya-ganjayl             'bother, ""humbug""'
yudba           'claim'           nya-yudbarraj           One who claims'
dagurrg         'peer'            nya-dagurrg             'peerer, voyeur'  The particle yudba is used to describe the action of people laying claim to things, saying
that those things are theirs, often with the connotation that they are falsely laying claim
to something which is actually somebody else's. The final syllable of nya-yudbarraj is
unpredictable, and no historical source can be suggested for it.
                                                           Other aspects of word formation 221
9.7. -man, agentive nominal suffixThe suffix -man was found ir two derived forms of agentive meaning: from the verb
particle gerrng-ma 'cry, weep', in yi-gerrngmarnan 'crybaby, one who cries a lot'; and
from the the finite verb ledbarna- 'look at', in yi-ledbarnan One who looks a lot, voyeur'.
  The final segment may be icentified as the absolutive nominal ending (see 3.4.), and
the sequence -rna- may be historically identified with that found in a small number of
finite verbs. This identificat on is quite certain, on the basis that, as noted above,
yi-ledbarnan is directly derived from the finite verb ledbarna- 'look at', and thus only
indirectly linked to the related verb particle led-ba 'look at'. Other verbs with the final
syllable -rna- arejomarna- 'fiiish off', and wojbarna- 'listen' (see 8.1.),
9.8. -widi ~ -bidi, nomin al-forming suffixA rare nominal-forming suflix is attested in two forms: yarrbaly-widi 'nuisance,
nuisance-maker', from the part icle yarrbaly; and jangang-bidl from the panicle jangang.
The meaning of the second requires some explanation.
 There are in Wardaman two particles which people gloss in Kriol as ""hard work la"",
but this has little to do with ""work"" in the Standard English sense. It has to do with the
notion of expending great eff art to try to tell someone something, to make someone
understand or ""listen"". One of these particles is jarnbab (which usually occurs with
yana-\ the other jangang (which also occurs with yana-). Thus it may be said:(526) jangang           ngarr-ge-yi-rri-ya                     wurrugu
       'work'           1INPL-AUX-RR-PST-NAR                   3NSG-DAT
       'We really tried hard with them' [i.e., to tell them something, or convince them
        of something].
  (Note that the AUX ga- is g?- before the reflexive-reciprocal marker.)
  The derived nominal jangang-bidi is used to mean someone who has been the object
of this hard work. Thus speakers gloss jangang-bidi as 'he can't believe', i.e., someone
upon whom one has had no effect, who is incapable of ""listening"" or ""being sorry"" (i.e.,
taking account of one's social effort with him or her).
  Efforts to test this suffix v/ith other particles were met with judgments of non-
acceptability, so it appears to te synchronically rather unproductive.
9.9. -ngana, nominal-forming suffixA rare suffix -ngana has been f aund with particle badbad 'cover' to form badbad-ngana
'blanket', and with reduplicative form durdurrb (from durrb 'stab, jab') to form
dardurrb-ngana 'doctor' (i.e., one who gives injections).
                             Chapter 10
                Issues in constituency and word order
10.1. The question of fn:e word orderAs modern description of Ausfalian languages intensified from the early 1970s, it was
commonly said that they exhibited ""free"" word order, both at the level of the phrase and
the clause (Dixon 1972; Sharpe 1972; see also more recently Simpson 1991, Chapter 2,
where ""free word order"" is desc ibed as a defining dimension of ""non-configurationality""
for the Pama-Nyungan language, Warlpiri). The general claim is that constituent word-
level units can be found in almost any order and the phrase or clause still be grammatically
acceptable. Taken in that baiic sense, Wardaman, too, exhibits greater freedom of
ordering than does English, for example.
  Some researchers, however, have reported of their languages that not all orders are
equally common within the pirase or clause (Heath 1984; Merlan 1988; McGregor
 1990). They have observed tha: ordering is freer than in English and many of the world's
better-known languages, but ha /e sought to open the question, Free with respect to what?
In other words, they have begun to explore the question whether the grammatical notion
of the ""clause"" is the appropriate basis in terms of which to describe ordering phenomena.
In my opinion, the answer wh ch is beginning to emerge from this work is that other
levels of analysis—for example, intersections between constituent structure possibilities
and their typical prosodically organized syntagmatic realizations — must be the units
against which different word-level orderings, and their differing frequency and
meaningfulness, need to be defined.
  We can illustrate from Wardaman examples the difficulties which arise in attempting
to define any particular noun phrase on the basis of constituent structure only, in order
to show how these problems have informed the approach taken further on in this chapter.
Many of the issues involved have been previously noted for their general descriptive
interest. Consider the first few lines of the text (appended) Jalijbang, about a moon
dreaming place on Innesvale Siation.
  A protagonist, of Yiwalyarri iubsection, is identified. Then:(527) yanggi bogogo gangma.i yorri
       'He went hunting and sheared a kangaroo'
        mangali
       'a female'
        wurre-warang
       'with young/a joey'.
 Then the information given to that point is summarized:
224 Chapter 10
(528) yorri nana gangman wiirre-warang
        'He speared the kangaroo with a joey'.
   Obviously, in the text as given, line divisions have already been made which appear to
 be of some significance. These, as will be described, are tone groups. At first,
 information is being conveyed in a manner that may be called ""expansion"": only a small
 ""bit"" is given in each apparent unit. Then a structurally more elaborate summation is
 given, that is, one in which the word-level units can evidently be assumed to comprise a
 whole unit (in this case, clause) in a way the preceding shorter units cannot. That clause
 contains a nominal constituent structure which is not uncommon in Wardaman,
 consisting of a demonstrative determiner, plus nominal plus a nominal modifier of the
 ""having X"" kind described in 5.3. In fact, as we will see, phrases consisting of the first
 two elements — demonstrative plus open-class nominal — are the commonest kind of
two-word noun phrase in Wardaman, and the position of the ""having"" modifier following
the entity is also typical (although such ""having"" constructions may of course occur by
themselves, as the sole word of a noun phrase). The more elaborate phrase shows us a
typical way in which the NP may be realized by a syntagm of words. The preceding
lines, however, cannot be identified as a single NP. One of the main reasons for that must
be taken to be the fact that preceding words do not all occur within a single unit as defined
by prosodic criteria. Semantically, we see that the descriptions ""female"", and ""having
joey"" further specify the reference of ""kangaroo"", for which here the generic term, rather
than any existing, specifically female term, was originally used. A phrase consisting of
an open-class nominal such as ""kangaroo"", and then followed within the same tone unit
by two additional nominal descriptors, would in fact be unusual. It is best to conclude
that in the preceding lines ""kangaroo"", ""female"", and ""having joey"" do not constitute a
phrase, continuous or discontinuous, but together constitute a typical association of
prosodically distinguished units of information.
   To even begin to assemble the evidence concerning what may, and what may not,
constitute a ""phrase"", we have to have some criteria of identification. One must, as is
ordinarily done, take into account the possible function or role of given words within a
conceivable grammatical constituent structure; but identification as a phrase cannot be
made ONLY on such grammatical bases, concerning the possible assignment of words to
constituent structure. If that were the only criterion, we might be tempted for example
to regardgangnian mangali wurre-warang as a discontinuous noun phrase, and perhaps
also to attempt permutations of these words in relation to the verb ""speared"", in order to
establish possibilities of ordering within the clause as a whole. Any or all of such
attempted permutations, I feel quite confident, would be accepted by informants as
intelligible. In doing that, however, we would lose sight of the fact that a group such as
gangnian ntangali wurre-warang is at least not usual within a single prosodically defined
unit.
  It is common for constituent structure to be defined with respect to attested examples
which show the apparent full range of possibilities of realization. What I am suggesting
here, however, may appear to some to go too far: that is, that what may count as an attested
example of a particular kind must be defined with respect to some apparently significant
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 225
criteria that belong to other levels of linguistic organization beyond the simply
grammatical. We have noted the common report that, when what is taken as the central
issue is ""grammaticality"", many Australian languages appear to exhibit such freedom in
ordering that the result has often been stated as ""any order is possible"". But that does not
tell us what orderings are morj frequent than others, or distinguish the meaningfulness
of the different orders. And when frequency becomes an issue alongside grammaticality,
then it must also be asked, in what contexts do particular orders occur? Ways must be
found of discriminating different linguistic contexts, and I am simply suggesting that that
cannot be done with respect :o the same phenomenon one is attempting, in the first
instance, to describe — grammatical function within constituency. Rather it must be
done with respect to actual realizations of syntagms which differ meaningfully.
Obviously, like some other Australianists (Heath 1984; McGregor 1990; all of us
following Halliday and others of the Firthian school), I accept that prosodically defined
units appear to be a significant and much under-studied resource for identifying contexts
with respect to which different realizations of constituent structure may be defined.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"

10.10. The ordering of object, agent and subjectIn 10.1. I suggested that it is not possible to approach certain questions of word order
with only the issue of ""grammaticality"" in mind, in Wardaman and other Australian
languages. Informants, when asked, will approve different orders within the phrase and
the elicitation sentence as grammatically acceptable and meaningful. But another matter
is what they will actually say themselves, with all the attendant questions of relative
frequency of different orders, and the meaningful organization of textual matter. The
clause is the understood unit of analysis with respect to which summaries of major
constituent ordering are usually made (as in formulae such as SVO, SOV etc.). But this
assumes that issues of ordering are fundamentally issues of clause-level grammatical
structure. There are however many other issues besides grammaticality which have to
do with the occurrence and ordering of nominal constituents.
  Some observations drawn from text material will be summarized here about the
positioning of the direct object, the ergative-marked transitive agent, and the intransitive
subject. These observations were made on text material that had been organized into
tone units. As I noted above this chapter, this organization was basic in that no thorough
analysis into primary and secondary intonation units was made, although such further
study seems promising. Rather, a simple division into tone units or contours was made
on the main criterion of pitch movement (generally but not always strongly linked with
pause phenomena). Once this is done, it becomes possible to talk about ordering of overt
noun phrases fulfilling major syntactic functions within the tone unit and with respect to
an occurring verb.
  There is an important general issue of the lexical realization of participants. The other
side of the coin is ellipsis (and what may be somewhat different, failure for participants
to be lexically specified through local portions of text, a more general question of
narrative style that will not be further discussed). The fact that two nominal functions
may be marked on the inflecting Wardaman verb by pronominal prefixes is linked to the
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 247
 fact of extensive nominal ellipsis particularly of nominals in intransitive and transitive
 subject functions.
    For instance, in the text Jalijbang, the protagonist Moon is introduced lexically in unit
 (1) by his subsection, Yiwalyarri, but is not designated again lexically until unit (83),
where he is referred to as gandawag 'moon'. By that time he has been the understood
 agent of 31 transitive constructions and numerous intransitive ones. There is only one
 occurrence of an ergative-marked noun in the entire text of 110 units, at 102 where
 Moon's wives return, figure out what has happened, and say, Oh! here the old man-ERG
 is keeping/has his mother-in-law. The relatively straightforward story-line as told, one
 might say, makes it possible for Moon to be the understood and largely ellipsed agent
 and subject of numerous transitive and intransitive verbs (and, interestingly, in this story
 the object of none).
   In the text Gawalyan, the first main character introduced is echidna herself. She is
 identified by the single noungawalyan 'echidna' on the first tone unit of the text. This
 is not ergative-marked, despite the fact that the next unit gives the information ""She had
 a small child"". The naming of echidna simply identifies her, and carries no clear
 indication of grammatical function. Such naming as the content of a tone unit, amounting
to apposition of participants rather than specification of grammatical function, is a
 common feature of Wardaman text. In the Gawalyan text, echidna is not lexically
identified again until line 26, where some birds ask her husband to lend his wife
 fyingawuyu) to them for sexual intercourse. This request, with lexical designation of
echidna as ""wife"", is repeated in line 28. Then there is no further lexical identification
of echidna until a final one in line 43, where she is described as having beenyibarnbarnin
'naked, hairless', until she was speared for refusing the birds, and so acquired quills.
There is no instance of ergative-marked agent in the entire text; for after the aggressor
birds have been lexically identified once (in lines 22 and 23, on tone units which name
them in absolutive case form), they are designated only by pronominal prefixes (subject
and object) on the verb throughout the remainder of the text.
   The two cases above might be among the texts where there is least lexical designation
of protagonists, and reference maintenance to protagonists principally through
pronominal prefixation. A text which shows more considerable lexical specification of
protagonists is Gumurrinji and Bornorron ""Emu and Brolga"". Here, emu asks brolga to
mind her children along with brolga's own while emu goes out foraging, and as in some
Shakespearean plots, there is ample possibility for confusioa Perhaps for that reason,
emu is lexically designated 6 times in a relatively short text, as is brolga; three of the
latter occurrences are Ergative-marked, as brolga maliciously destroys emu's children
while she is away. Nevertheless there is no case in which both agent and object are
lexically specified on the same tone unit, and thus no specific evidence for the ordering
of ""brolga"" and ""emu"" with respect to each other as lexemes in particular major syntactic
functions. Overall, lexical specification of agent and object in the same tone unit is rare
textually, but there are instances (such as Dalyarra line 30, ""two-ERG women- ERG held
her legs-ABS on either side"", or the order AVO).
   In attempting to calculate the occurrence of overt nominals as agents, subjects and
objects, it seemed important to distinguish cases in which they occurred within the same
248 Chapter 10tone unit as the verbal word(s) bearing pronominal agreement, versus those in which they
occurred on another tone group (often, set off as simple nouns or nominal expressions
on a tone unit by themselves in absolutive form, or sometimes with case specification).
Table 18 shows tabulations derived from 24 texts of nominal (including pronominal)
elements in given functions — as direct objects, intransitive subjects, and (ergative-
marked) agents, and their position pre- or post-verbally within the tone unit.","[270, 271, 272]"
"12.5.7. Ngala, emphatic confirmationThe conjunction ngala (12.3.3.) signals a break in relation to previous text. It may be
either strongly adversative, equivalent to English ""but""; or less strongly so, and often
understood as a topic-changing ""but what about?"".
  There is a further interjectional use of ngala, as emphatic confirmation in response to
a question. In the instances attested the polarity of such questions has been positive, as
in the following exchange in which a woman speaker was recounting the taking away of
her sister's child by a welfare officer to the writer and another woman, B:(844) A:       wurr-gelewu-rri     wurren    nganinggin   jongon                   glla

       B:       'Did she cry for him?'
       A:      'And howlTYes indeed!'
  The break normally signalled by ngala applies interpersonally, within the speech
situation, to create the most emphatic kind of confirmatory response. There is no
necessary implication on the part of the respondent A that B thought the sister did NOT
cry; rather, the sense is simply one of forceful confirmation.",[351]
"7.5.5. 'What kind?','how many?' gun.garr-maThe interrogative gun.garr-nia may be used to question a nominal, in relation to which

        'What's the word?'
  This is used in the sense ""What's the news?"", ""What's happened?"", ""What did they
say?"", and the like.
  This interrogative may also be used in a more general sense, not to question a particular
nominal, but (often with indefinite suffix, see 7.5.7.) to ask ""what kind?"" of an entire
proposition. Used in this way, it can be meant to express, for example, ""how many?""(296) gun.garr-nw-warda  yanan yibiwan  wud-janga-ndi yi-jad-bi

  Ordinarily the form is as given, exhibiting a suffix which may be identified with the
usual verb particle suffix -ba —nva. Without this, and suffixed with nominal derivational

2.3. Distributional restrictions: ConsonantsWord-initially there is no distinctive contrast bet wee n consonants of the two apical series.
Where no vowel immediately precedes, in ordinary speech the word-initial realization
of initial apicals tends to be alveolar rather than retroflex. However, when a vowel (of
another word, or of a vowel-final inflectional prefix) immediately precedes, the stem-
initial norm tends to be quite strongly retroflex (but in terms of auditory impression, not
quite so much so as in some languages of the region, for example, Ngalakan). For
example:
       ['na.rri]         'he saw it'
       [yi'rna.rri ]     'you [SG] saw it'
      ['climana]        'horse'
      [y/ 'rdirdiman ] proper name, YI- class marker  Though there is no reason to recognize a word-initial contrast between the two stop-
nasal series, the question remains how to represent the morpheme-initial norm, as plain
alveolar, or as retroflex, or perhaps some other way which shows that there is no clear
auditory contrast except post-vocalically, and following non-nasal sonorants.
  This situation, or something similar, presents itself in a number of the local languages
that have two apical series (see e.g., Merlan 1983: 9-10); that is, there is no, or in some
languages scarcely any, direct contrast between morpheme-initial alveolar and retroflex
apicals. Though the situation might be descriptively treated in a number of ways, my
preference is to regard morphemes as retroflex initial. Phonetically, the retroflex series
is relatively marked, the plain alveolar unmarked. In light of this, it is theoretically more
satisfactory to explain the lack of phonetic contrast word-initially by a neutralization in
favour of realization by the less marked series, than to treat the situation as one in which
retroflexion adds a feature to some kind of archiphonemic segment in the post-vocalic
environment (following a vowel-final prefix).
  However, a practical cost is associated with the decision to treat morphemes as retroflex
initial. Usage in most of this description, as is otherwise common, is to represent retroflex
segments in practical orthography by a digraph consisting of r plus a letter designating
the rest of the segment (e.g., rd for the apical stop, etc.). It is daunting to write the r
morpheme initially, a procedure which results in forms like rdagbarla 'keep it', and
rnarri 'he/she saw it'. Therefore in practical transcription, lexeme-initial apicals will
be represented without initial r. This practice is extended to phonetic environments in
which retroflexion is quite pronounced, as after vowel-final prefixes (e.g., nga-nam Ί
saw it'). This makes it necessary for anyone reading this transcription to keep in mind
that, following vowel-final prefixes and elsewhere post-vocalically, the pronunciation of
initial apical consonants of lexical stems is with a significant degree of retroflexion.
                                                                          Segmental phonology 17
  The contrast between apical series is amply illustrated elsewhere, morpheme- and
word-medially and finally. In word-final position note the contrasts between members
of each series:
   /gulid/      'green plum'          vs.          /mardird/           'whistling kite'
   /menjen/      'dangerous'          vs.          /mejern/            'belly'
                                      vs.          /yingelembern/      'collarbone'   /jurrul/     'saltwater turtle'    vs.          /nyurl/             'be/get angry'   There are additionally numerous examples of minimal and sub-minimal contrasts
medially between the two series: e.g., wu-walu 'ring finger' vs. wu- warli 'arm, creek,
tributary'; yirrgitlun 'river' vs.yigurliyn 'first rain'; ngone 'hooked spear' vs. wurne
 'bone'; yi-welen 'jealousperson' vs.yi-werlen 'lazy person'; bidij 'twist' vs.birdij'find'
 (particles); gelelen 'cold' vs. gerle- 'to taste'; gitda 'where' vs. bigurda, a kind of plat
potato; gadi 'lily' vs. gardirrg 'gnash teeth' (particle), and so on.
   The above generalization does not apply to the rhotics, since /IT/ has not been found
initially in lexical stems, and only two instances of /r/ have been noted to date: the bird
term rewrew 'dollar bird', and a toponym (referring to a creek near Willeroo Station
homestead in the Wardaman heartland, and seemingly not a foreign form), Relwuyugun.
Besides the fact that the bird term is onomatopoetic, it should also be noted that very
similar terms for this bird occur in neighbouring languages. It is likely that there are
complex diffusional relations among them. However, in Jawoyn the form of the word is
dewdew, and beyond the surmise that the diffusional source is not from Jawoyn, it is not
clear why Wardaman should have a form with an initial segment that does not otherwise
occur in that position in the language.
   /rr/ does occur initially in inflectional morphemes which can never be word-initial, e.g.,
in the past tense allomorph -rri. /r/ is (so far) not attested in stem-final position, indicating
at the least that it is c[uite uncommon there, if indeed it may occur at all. The apical /rr/
however is common finally, e.g., /bamarr/ Owenia vernicosa, 'marble tree', /geremerr/
'headband', and so on.
   Medially, the contrast between the two rhotics distinguishes a considerable number of
forms, and there is no reason to regard the contrast as marginal (cf. Cook 1987: 29 on
Wakiman). Exemplifying by comparing the sequences -ara- and-arra-, we may list the
contrasting forms, among others: war ay 'ask', baraj 'far', garab 'spider', wuniara
'heavy stone', janiaram1 lid, doof,garnaniara 'walking stick' Jabara 'putrid, stinking',
barangan 'rift,gap',darab 'bog', and-garang ~ -warang 'having'; vs. barlarra 'hide',
barragarl 'spear', buwarraja 'dreaming', lawarra 'riflefish', warrala 'lie, be spread-
legged5, warrania ' sugar glider', -barra ~ -warra adverbial suffix, among others.
   Some consideration needs to be given to the statement of the distributions of the two
palatal sonorants ly and ny. We will consider the lamino-palatal lateral first, since its
distribution, however analyzed, is especially restricted Then we will return to questions
of the statement of distribution that apply to both lateral and nasal palatal segments.
   The lamino-palatal lateral (unlike the nasal) never occurs in stem- or word-initial
position, and its occurrence medially (excluding, for the moment, intervocalically) and
18 Chapter 2finally is quite restricted, both lexically and positionally. The following includes all
instances of medial (save intervocalic) and final ly found in a list of approximately 2000
(mostly lexical) roots (excluding names of all sorts, personal, toponymic and other):
      bedelybedeyl                'hit all over, flog'
      bilyb(a)                    'switch, swish long object over' (esp. in curing)
      bilybanbilyban              'devil dog' (etym. related to above)
      dilygba                     'wait'
      ally gun                    'possum'
      dilyma                      'light, burn'
      ganyjayl                    'annoy, bother, disturb'
     gilywaj                      'trample'
     jalybug                      'pound, crush up, mince'
     jilyma                       'wring out, squeeze (juices) out of
     milygbilygba                 'beat, thump, ""heart-crack"" [Kr.], be shocked'
     wily ma                      'stretch'
      wilyma                      'whistle' (different AUX from above)
     yarrbayl                     'bother, annoy'  This list demonstrates that about half the instances of the lamino-palatal lateral are final
in verb particles (which often have the additional morph -ma, see 11.1.2.)· Otherwise,
the lateral occurs only before peripheral segments (mainly stops b and g, but note one
instance before w). Overall, the lateral shows a nearly-complete lexical restriction to verb
particles (with the exception ofdilygun 'possum', and the derivate bilybanbilyban).
  There are comparable distributional restrictions on the lamino-palatal lateral in
Yangman, as far as the more limited data indicate. Also, there is in Mangarrayi a small
handful of />'-final verb particles (four have been found). And though all of these appear
to also occur in Yangman, and evidently represent an historical diffusion from that
language, inquiry indicates they are now regarded by speakers as Mangarrayi words, and
not as recognizable borrowings. The restricted distribution of this lateral can, on the basis
of the evidence, be seen as an areal phenomenon in which Mangarrayi participates
marginally.
  In Wardaman, there seems to be little plausibility to the suggestion that these instances
may be viewed (historically) as combinations of / plus a high vowel IM phonetically
realized as palatalization. There are enough cases of stem-final // (e.g., mangali 'girl,
female') to make it clear that such palatalization is not, in any event, a synchronic process.
And there are attestations of word-final lyi, as in /malyi/, toponym. In contrast with the
lateral, the palatal nasal is much more common stem-finally, and is distributed over
different parts of speech (e.g., juyn 'to set' (of sun, particle), jirrangaliyn 'mud
swallow'). It, too, contrasts directly with final nyi (as in mobonyi 'night time').
  There is, however, some question about analysis of both palatal sonorants
intervocalically, simply because in that position there is no clear or convincing basis for
a contrast between ly versus a combination /+ y, or between ny versus n+ y, as there
                                                                          Segmental phonology 19
is finally. This is true, for example, of a word for a catfish species, which could
alternatively be /ginyang/ or /ginyang/, or the word for 'echidna' which might
alternatively be represented phonemically as /gawalyan or /gawalyan/.
  The question of a two-segment versus single-segment analysis may simply be said to
be irrelevant in those medial environments. There is no phonetic difference that can be
established between the two possibilities. We can show this by observing inter-
morphemic combinations of n + y and / + y, where the y is the initial segment of an
inflectional suffix (e.g., YI-buruwun-yi 'killer', ERG). In the text transcriptions in
practical orthography, morphemic combination is always distinguished from intra-
morphemic ny and ly by a hyphen at morpheme boundary.
  In summary concerning word- and morpheme-final position, we note that all stops and
nasals, all the laterals, the glides /y/ and /w/, and apical /IT/ are attested, while /r/ is not.
A few examples attest to final contrast between each glide, and the combination of glide
and homorganic vowel, for example:
      dawu      'that way'         vs.          daw                   'sound sleep',
                                           also maw                   'take off'
      waray     'ask'              vs.          gunduyi-ma            'give hiding, belt'  The set of final nasal contrasts is illustrated by:
      yi-mum            'eye'
      gunbilin          '(native) doctor'
      mejern            'stomach'
      garnbayn          'type of cabbage palm'
      gayardung         'run'  The contrast among laterals finally is exemplified by:
     jil-ma             'company, keep company' (particle)
     jily-ma            'wring, squeeze' (particle)
     mirlirl-ma         'rise' (of sun)  The final contrast among stops is illustrated by:
     bardab             'look around'
     dulwad             'count, enumerate'
     mardird            'kite'
     garnbij             'clapstick'
     gandawag           'moon'2.4. Phonotactics: Consonant clustersThere are no morpheme-initial consonant clusters except for the very rare combination
gl, so far attested in only two forms: -gle 'putrid, rotten', and medially in the (obligatorily
reduplicative) particle lowaglowa 'play', gle- has never been found to occur
20 Chapter 2
word-initially, but rather is always preceded by one of the noun class prefixes (yi-gle,
wu-gle). There is also a place name wugleni 'Johnstone Hole', which might be related
etymologically to the root -gle. There is at least one instance, in a bird name, of a
particularly minimal and indistinct, if indeed organic, vocalic segment between b snarl.
This occurs in the word \jnjiirijbllrlan]' friar bird'. However, there are no other instances
suggesting the possibility of a cluster bl.
  Within morphemes, combinations of apical nasal plus apical stop contrast as between
the two apical series: nd vs. rnd. As in neighbouring languages, there are no such
combinations in which the nasal and stop differ in place. The same is true for the (rare)
combinations of lateral plus apical stop (e.g., Id, which only occur at reduplicative
boundaries). The transcriptional practice adopted for the retroflex combinations is to
write the indicator of retroflexion only once, thus: rnd, rid.","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"

  The orthography is convenient in that it requires no special diacritics. However, the
digraph ng representing the velar nasal needs to be distinguished from the sequence
apical nasal plus velar stop , as in the word /dongo/ 'in a line'. In order to eliminate this
ambiguity, that combination is written with full stop separating the two segments: don.go.
This is not done at morpheme boundary, however, where the presence of hyphen is
sufficient to indicate that two distinct segments of different morphemes are involved,
e.g., yibiwan-gu 'man, person' (Dative).
12 Chapter 2    Word-finally, the palatal digraphs are inverted (ly is written as yl, and ny as yn),
 because this seems to make it easier for those who already read English to approximate
 the correct pronunciation.
    In Wardaman, the bilabial series involves true bilabial occlusion.
    In the apico-alveolar series, the active articulator is the tip of the tongue making contact
 with the alveolar ridge. For the apico-domal or retroflex consonants, the active
 articulator is the apex making contact in the pre-palatal region. It can be difficult to
distinguish phonetically between members of the two apical series, especially
 intervocalically. Here, even what turn out, upon close investigation, to be plain apical
consonants, may occasionally have a hint of retroflex vocoid on-glide. Also, what turn
out to be retroflex segments are often realized with relatively little phonetic retroflexion,
and this appears to be true in any position. Thus the apical series, across their realizations,
tend to be more similar to each other than in some other languages of the region. Despite
the problems sometimes posed by identification of the difference between corresponding
members of the two series, and even despite a certain tendency towards harmonic
phonetic ""spread"" of retroflexion to other apical consonants in the word following a
retroflex one (perhaps similar to a phenomenon identified in Wakiman by Cook 1987:
26-29, see 3.7.3.), there can be no doubt of the phonological status of the distinction in
Wardaman.
   For the production of lamino-palatals, the tongue is laterally spread, with the tip of the
tongue touching the back of the lower teeth, the blade the alveo-palatal region. Lateral
spread of the tongue is particularly noticeable in the (rather rare) realizations of the
lamino-palatal lateral ly before peripheral stops and glides. All three laterals are voiced
bilateral approximants.
   The velar series is dorso-palatal.
   Of the two rhotics, the apico-alveolar /rr/ is a tap, never a trill. The glide Irl is a post-
alveolar approxirnant. There is no question of the phonemic distinctness or positional
neutralization of the rhotic contrast in Wardaman, Yangman, and Dagoman. But here
again a signal difference with Wakiman must be noted: there, the rhotic contrast
minimally distinguishes few forms, and the tap rhotic in that language has a variant which
is phonetically indistinguishable from the post-alveolar glide (Cook 1987: 29).
   /w/ is a voiced bilabial frictionless continuant, with rounding noticeable before /u/ and
Ιοί. However, before /u/ in the noun class prefix /wu/, there may be very little to no
noticeable lip-rounding or protrusion, such that the realization of this sequence is [u].
Likewise, the voiced vocoid /y/, normally produced with considerable lateral tongue
spread and approximation of blade and mid-tongue to palate, may exhibit a minimal
degree of these articulatory features word-initially before the high front III. This is
frequently the case in the realization of the higher animate noun class prefix /yi/, as [/'],
but much less so of pre-/i/ realizations elsewhere (e.g., in such words as yilgbayi 'all
right, enough'). The correct generalization seems to be that where the conditions are met
for higher and tenser realization of/i/, there may be minimal realization of the semivowel.
Where, however, (as in yilgbayi, with its closed first syllable), there is [/] realization of
the vowel, there tends to be fuller realization of the semivowel. And it is precisely in its
morpho-phonological occurrences as noun class prefix that the former conditions (for
                                                                        Segmental phonology 13
higher and tenser realization of the vowel, see below on vowel allophony) are most often
met. Since there is no other compelling evidence for a contrast between /yi/ and /i/
morpheme-initially, nor, indeed, any independent evidence for vowel-initial morphemes
(save one α-initial one) in the language, this can apparently be treated as a specialization
in the noun class morphemes.
  The vowel /i/ is realized as a high, front, maximally tense [/] in open syllables, and
particularly before the palatal segments /j/, /ny/, /ly/, both semivowels, and also the rhotic
/rr/, as in the following examples (in some, more than one condition is met):
      [ 'warrija ]      'alligator'
      [ 'lidi ]         'long-horned grasshopper'
      [li'warrga ]      'ground sugar bag'
      [ 'girrgilang ]   'galah'
      f 'ginyang ]      catfish species
      [ 'ginydan ]      'stone spear point'  In the last form above, the high and tense vowel quality is the main auditory cue
signalling the palatal articulation of the following nasal, which before the stop normally
evidences no palatal off-glide.
  The /i/ vowel is realized as slightly lower and less tense in closed syllables:
      [ 'munln ]        'rock cod'
      [ 'mardlrd ]      'whistling kite'
      [yllg'bayi]       OK, enough'   There are morphemes with phonetic long [/':], sometimes also realized as a diphthong
[if]. This appears to be best regarded as the sequence /iyi/, which can be shown to contrast
with /i/ in an otherwise very similar environment. The following two forms illustrate
this contrast between such a long vowel, and a fairly high, tense but short /i/:
      \ji:la}           'well'                   /jiyila/
      \jila ]           originative suffix       /jila/  There are other examples for which no minimally or sub-minimally distinct form can
be cited, e.g., [bi:marla], /biyimarla/ 'inflate'.
  There is a parallel to the above in the length of the vowel, and syllable reduction, in the
verb particle [du:], also realized as [duU] 'to raise' (with auxiliary bu-), in the noun [lu:n]
'cave', in the noun [ngu:n] 'faeces', in the particle [buUdba] 'cook under ashes', the
noun stem [muUdban] 'wet soil'. In all cases we must recognize the combination of
/uwu/ in accounting for the phonetic length of the vowel: /duwu/, /luwun/, /nguwun/,
/buwud-ba/, /mu-wudban/ (the latter apparently with nominal class marker showing fixed
assimilation to the first stem vowel).
  In contrast with the above V\ + homorganic glide + Vi sequences, combinations with
vowel and heterorganic glide, [iwi] and [uyu], tend to remain clearly syllabified, or may
be only slightly reduced ([yi-ngawuyu] 'wife', [miwinin] 'camp, sleep').
14 Chapter 2  /e/ is realized as a mid front unrounded, and fairly lax vowel [e] in closed syllables,
except before palatal segments, where it tends to be at its highest and tensest It may be
slightly higher and tenser in open syllables, including word-finally, but not cardinal [e]:     ['bedbog ]                   'honey eater'
     ['nienjen ]                  'cheeky'
     [ gej ]                      ' ask' (particle)
     ['nienyje]                   'to feel, hold, grasp'
     [ tiK'gernnan ]              Dioscorea sp.
     [ yinge 'we]                    might fall'
     [ jenibe ]                   ' death adder'  In almost all environments lot is realized as a mid to slightly lower rounded vowel [o].
It is slightly higher than mid in the environment of /w/, but is nowhere cardinal [o].     [mo'gorlgorl ]              Anipelocissus sp.
     [ 'nyob o ]                  ' marsupi al mouse'
     ['ngorrogorro ]              'afternoon'
     ['nsno'iiwrran ]            personal name
     ['nonggs ]                  'too, also' (cf. [nungguru ] 'hand')  The distinction between realizations of/o/ and/u/ can be difficult to identify, but clearly
bears a considerable functional load in lexical stems.
  The usual realization of /u/ is [U ], in closed syllables. It is slightly higher and tenser
in open syllables, including word-finally, and before palatal segments:     [wi'liwiiga ]                'stone curlew'
     ['bUlyan}                    'eagle'
     [nuirru 'jUnnian ]           ' sand frog'
     [ 'naribu ]                  ' freshwater mussel'  Under primary stress in open syllables, /a/ is realized as maximally open, [a.]; in other
open syllables it is regularly realized as slightly more centered [a], and this is
approximately its 'elsewhere' realization, except before apicals, where it is slightly
fronted, somewhere between [a] and [ce\.     \gu 'lirrida ]              ' peew ee'
     [ 'ga. läwärrä ]            ' plumed pigeon'
     [li'rra.wln ]               'black cockatoo'
     \ja'ntardba ]               'rainbow fish'
                                                                      Segmental phonology 15
2.2. Distributional restrictions: VowelsVowels do not occur morpheme-initially in Wardaman, except in the tag-question particle
ale (this is one of the few Wardaman words often produced with an audible, final glottal
constriction, indicative of the intensity of the tag question syntagm 'is that so?'). It was
noted above that the noun class prefixes /wu/ and /yi/, i.e., with homorganic semivowel
and vowel, are commonly realized as [u] and [/]. In other such word-initial combinations,
the glide tends to remain unreduced, or somewhat less so; and the semivowel is not
reduced in initial combination with non-homorganic vowel:
     [Vw/τεη]         'child'
     ['wUjbln]        'greedy'
     [yu'gUrni]       'more, again'
  However, there is some variation, and there are some words, like /wuja/ 'fire, wood',
which appear to be commonly realized in both ways. In that word, it is likely the /wu/
is etymologically the noun class prefix, synchronically however to be analyzed as part
of the root. Leaving aside the matter of the noun class prefixes, and other instances of
word-initial /wu/ and /yi/ which may vary somewhat in degree of realization of the
semivowel, there is, as noted in 2.1., no cause to recognize vowel-initial morphemes in
Wardaman. The difference between morpheme-initial glide plus homorganic vowel, and
vowel alone, is environmentally limited (i.e., most common in the nominal class
markers), and never minimally distinctive. The absence or infrequency of vowel-initial
morphemes is also characteristic of a number of neighbouring languages, including
Mangarrayi, Yangman, and Jawoyn. Slightly further east, we find a very limited range
of α-initial morphemes in Alawa (Sharpe 1972) and Ngalakan (Merlan 1983: 11). In
Wardaman, there are a few inflectional morphemes that have the shape C (e.g., present
tense suffix -n, but none consists only of V, or has initial V.
  As noted in 1.3., the mid-vowels do not occur in any of the inflectional morphology,
which exhibits a three-vowel system, a, i, and u. There is, however, no lack of surface
mid-vowels in inflectional morphs, due to phonetic processes of assimilation (3.7.3.).
Among derivational morphemes and lexical suffixes, too, the mid-vowels are rare, but
there are instances, such as adverbial /beng/, expressing location or place where. The
mid-vowels are widely distributed over lexemes, and there is no particular evidence of
""defective"" distribution with respect to any word class. Though /a/, /i/ and /u/ are more
common finally than the mid-vowels, there are nonetheless quite a number of examples
of Id and /o/ finally, e.g.,: bone 'across'; ngajamberle, proper name; lowe, toponym;
bogo 'lend', jewele 'close, near', wume 'sky', modborrongo, proper name; and
inflectional forms of quite a number of verbs.
  Examples of minimal and sub-minimal vowel contrasts are:
     jin(ma)          'blame'
     jen(ma)          'cut into pieces'
     juny(ma)         'set' (of sun, celestial body)
     jongma-          'to kiss'
     jangma-          'to defecate'
16 Chapter 2
  There are no vowel clusters.
  See 3.7.3. for further remarks on distribution of the mid-vowels.","[35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]"

10.2. Information units, given/new and theme/rheme contrastsHalliday (1985 and earlier) suggests that two major dimensions of textual organization
in English have to do with ""information"" and ""thematisation"" (see also McGregor 1990
for application of Hallidayan concepts to the Western Australian language Gooniyandi).
Information is concerned wit ι the given/new opposition, and thematisation with the
theme/rheme, or topic/comm:nt, opposition. He further suggests that information
structure is primarily expressed prosodically, while the thematic structure is realised
through constituent order. In the previous section I suggested the importance of
considering constituency and prosody in relation to each other, in order to achieve a
descriptive scheme which delimits phrase structure and ordering possibilities within the
phrase in a meaningful way. For present purposes, I consider the use of prosodically
defined units to be one of the most helpful methodological offerings of the Halliday
framework, mainly because it provides an opening into the study of the interaction
between grammaticality and other levels of the organization of text.
  Halliday (1985: 274) observes that an information unit does not correspond exactly to
any unit in the clause grammar, but other things being equal, tends to be coextensive with
one clause, as the ""default"" ccndition in English. Each information unit is realized as a
pitch contour, or TONE, which extends over the whole tone group. Within the tone group,
one foot or syllable carries thi main pitch movement, and the element which has this
feature of tonic prominence is said to carry the information focus. The tonic foot marks
where the 'new' element of information ends. Halliday (1985:277) considers information
that is presented by the speaker as recoverable as ""given"", and that which is presented
as not recoverable to be ""new"".
  The Wardaman texts appended to this grammar were realized as sequences of tone units.
Each such unit is identified by number. Many are short and occupy only one line. The
main criterion for identifying ;i tone unit is on the basis that it is bounded by significant
pitch movement, either a rise or a fall. Typically, such a unit is also bounded by short
226 Chapter 10 pause, but the presence of pause is not in itself defining of a tone group. In some cases
 it is ambiguous whether a particular stretch of speech is best identified as two tone units
 or as one. This is especially the case where it appears that there may be some pitch
 movement at the possible tone unit boundary, but pitch remains relatively constant
 (compared to other instances). In other words, questions of identification may arise
 because intonational phenomena are perceived as a matter of degree. The temptation to
 identify a separate tone unit may be strengthened where there is also pause at such a
 possible boundary, but as noted above, pause in itself is not definitional of the tone unit.
    As McGregor (1990: 362) notes for Gooniyandi, tone units in Wardaman do not
 necessarily correspond to grammatical units, although they do so in particular cases. As
has often been noted for Australian languages (and as in the Moon Dreaming text, above),
a single nominal word may frequently be found on a tone unit of its own, set apart from
 other constituents to which it is meaningfully linked. Because nominal and other words
are frequently set off in this way on their own tone unit, a number of such units together
may contain the information that might otherwise be contained within a clause. At the
same time, it may often happen, as Halliday has shown for English, that a tone group will
be equivalent to a clause, as for the Moon Dreaming group ""he speared the kangaroo
with joey"". In the case of smaller constituent units which may comprise part of a clause,
I make the assumption that while whatever set of nominal words occurs on a single tone
unit may comprise (one or more) noun phrases, it is not legitimate to assume that nominal
constituents occurring in different tone groups constitute part of the same particular
phrase (although the same actual forms may occur elsewhere as part of a phrase on a
single tone group). Thus, in the above Moon Dreaming example, mangali 'female' and
wurre-warang cannot be regarded as part of the same noun phrase, even though these
two words might occur together elsewhere within a tone unit and as part of a noun phrase.
That is, I am prepared to use occurrence on a single tone unit as a minimum condition,
necessary but not sufficient, for the identification as a noun phrase of any given set of
nominal words.
   Following Grimes (1975) and others, it is possible to suggest that there is a distinction
to be made between more central or primary tone units, and secondary ones (see
McGregor 1990: 364). In such a scheme, the primary unit may be defined by greater
prominence of its salient syllable, and by greater pitch movement over the contour. A
secondary unit, whatever its precise character, may be defined as in association with a
primary one, and generally characterized negatively, by lesser syllable salience and lesser
pitch movement. McGregor (1991: 365) suggests for Gooniyandi that the primary unit
normally contains the propositional nexus: the verbal complex in clauses with verbs.
Further, secondary units normally consist of a single clausal constituent: NP, adverbial,
or other. McGregor goes on to hypothesize the existence of a tonic sentence, defined as
a primary unit in association with one or more optional secondary ones. In information
terms, the secondary unit(s) tend(s) to elaborate the primary one, or otherwise convey
information closely related to that of the primary unit. I have not put this plausible
distinction between primary and secondary units to work in this description, that is, units
in the texts are not identified as primary or secondary. I would only note that the
distinction might be profitably elaborated as a set of typical primary-secondary tone unit
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 227
nexus types; for example, there is a prosodic relation of dependency between the
(typically short and unelaboraied) tone units containing a ""say"" verb, and the unit(s)
which realize the reported speech which the verb projects.
  There follows consideration of the constituency of the noun phrase, and in 10.8. a
summary of noun phrase structire types. This is given together with discussion of normal
ordering within the phrase. While no doubt further meaningful distinctions made by
ordering remain to be discerned, it is suggested that regular meaningful differences in
the presentation of information appear to be associated in some instances with the
difference between the orders: demonstrative determiner followed by nominal, versus
nominal followed by demonstrative determiner (DEM + N versus N + DEM). I will
propose that this difference may be seen as part of the organization of difference between
unmarked and marked Theme types, that is, less or more remarkable organization of what
any particular tone unit or sequence of them is ""about"". A further introductory word may
be useful here about the notion of theme.
  Again following Halliday (1935:278-279) in his elaboration of Firthian and Pragueian
notions, thematic structure may be defined as that dimension in which is organized what
a stretch of speech is about. Theme is commonly defined as (1) the point of departure
of what the speaker has to say, or more fully, (2) what the speaker is talking about, the
topic; while Rheme is commonly defined as the completion of this point of departure, or
the comment. Obviously, the £ iven/new contrast may interact closely with the theme/
rheme one, in that, for example, it is possible for something to be presented as either an
expected or unexpected, a givei or not given, point of departure.
  Finally, we will need to consider how to approach the question of the presence and
ordering of nominal constituents of clause-level syntactic function, intransitive Subject,
transitive Object, and ergative-marked Agent. It is common enough for such functions
to be marked only on the verb within any given tone unit, that is, for there to be no overt
nominal expression of any given major clause function. Some discussion of lexical
realization of these functions is thus required, because case-marking of them is obviously
dependent upon their occurrence. But beyond that, is it possible to say that an occurring
nominal typically precedes or :bllows the verb of which it is the object? To the extent
that the agent of a transitive verb is realized by a nominal expression, where does this
occur with respect to the verb1; We will see that the ergative-marked agent is the least
frequently occurring of the three syntactic types, and that there is a tendency for all three
to occur preceding the verbal word or words; but that this tendency is apparently strongest
for nouns and noun phrases in intransitive subject function, noticeable but not extreme
for ergative-marked transitive igents, and least noticeable for transitive objects, which
occur both pre- and post-verba ly with more nearly equal frequency.","[249, 250, 251]"
"7.5.2. 'What?' ngamanda'What?' ngamanda occurs most commonly in Absolutive form as directly questioned
element (as in ""What did you get?"") and may also occur as nominal modifier (as in ""What
food did you get?""); as Dative-marked ngamanda-wu meaning ""what for? why?"";
Instrumental-marked ""by means of what?"" or Ergative-marked (see (288) below);
Dissociative- and Source-marked; suffixed with adverbial -barra ~ -warra in very
similar sense to the Instrumental; and also ""having""-suffixed, also meaning
approximately ""why? what for? concerning what?"" as in the following:(282)    ngamanda-\varang         nu-nyanga-ndi

        'What did you come for?' 'Concerning what did you come?'.

  In the excerpt (284) the speaker was recalling an actual incident and asking, ""What
game animal?"" (did we eat on that occasion); and having thought about it, supplies the
answer ""that (was) goanna"" (note use of the Proximate demonstrative here, see 7.2.).
  ""What?"" more often than not is suffixed with one of the emphatic or indefinite suffixal
elements discussed in 7.5.5. - 7.5.7., and there is further exemplification of it in those
sections.

7.5.3. 'Where'? guda'Where?' guda has an inflectional paradigm similar to that of the direction terms (7.4.)-
The morphological absolutive form may be used either where the sense is static (as in
""Where are you?""), or directional (""Where are you going?""). There is also an explicitly
directional, Allative-marked form guda-rlan, and Ablative gudang-ba. ""Where?"" is
also, however, found suffixed with the ordinary Locative (gudang-nya) as in:(285)   nga-gi-ndi          gej-ba        gudang-nya            0-we-ndi

  Like the Immediate and Proximate demonstratives (7.2.), guda may be suffixed with
an Article-like suffix -ni, guda-ni 'where?', either static or directional.(286)   guda      mulurru          0-yanggi                    guda          mulurru

"7.5.6. Emphatic (question) suffix -gulaIn this and the following two sub-sections three suffixes are discussed which occur with
interrogative expressions and contribute different sorts of modal flavourings. The first
of these, -gula, appears to be the most emphatic and demanding of response (and/or
agreement), perhaps equivalent in feeling-tone to a loudly-spoken ""that's right?"". Its
emphatic character is indicated by the fact that it is one of the few words in the language
which is often followed by phonetic glottal stop — another is the question tag ale
(12.4.1.). Its distribution, however, distinguishes it from the latter, in that -gula as
recorded generally has a single (nominal) element or phrase within its scope and not an
entire proposition, as ale may. -gula is also phrase-final, and not followed by any
grammatical suffix; in this it differs from another question suffix -gan, discussed in the
next section.
  Examples of -gula are:(298) ngan-gerne-rri         birrg     inayin                 nganianda-warang-gula

33. Degemination
Wherever geminate clusters of homorganic stops or nasals arise as the result of morpheme
combination, the cluster is usually simplified to a single segment. However,
degemination is facultative (though usual) in one morpho-phonologically ""outer""
environment, and obligatory only in more internal ones, as in some processes at the
boundary between pronominal prefix and verb stem (see 3.5.1.).
  It might be claimed that no underlying clusters of homorganic consonants occur in
Wardaman; or, more conservatively, that there are no lexical stems with such underlying
clusters. Below, this section, a small number of homorganic apical nasal plus nasal
clusters are suggested to be underlying structurally in pronominal prefix combinations
to the verb, a proposal in keeping with a way of envisioning basic patterning; hence the
alternative statement of the claim.
                                                                          Process phonology 27
  Though there are no geminate clusters in lexical stems, common processes of
morpheme combination result in geminate clusters across boundaries. One of those
boundaries is that between verb particle, and the particle suffix of shape -ma or -ba
(11.1.2.). Following stops, hardening accounts for the stop-initial shape -ba. Where this
follows a particle ending in -b, the cluster b- b arises (lub-ba 'grab'). Where the
particle-suffix follows a particle ending in m, the cluster m-m arises (lom-ma 'peel').
This boundary may be considered morpho-phonologically more external than certain
others (see 3.5.1.), partly on the basis that degemination is facultative, though usual, here:
instances where degemination does not occur are found throughout my data. Failure to
occur was recognizable in one of two ways: as a distinction between two articulations,
or (more commonly) not completely distinct articulations but slightly greater length in
the holding of the articulatory position, e.g., \jub:a] 'shut', a particle which is
alternatively realized as \juba] (orjub, without suffix).
  The combination g-g across morpheme boundaries arises from certain frequent
morpheme combinations: the suffixation to stem ending in -g (see 3.4.) of the post-stop
dative allomorph -gu, dissociative allomorph -gunya, of ""having"" suffixal allomorph
-garang, of allative allomorph -garr, and so on (e.g., allative-suffixed form of stem
goyog- 'bitter, salty' is goyog-garr, normally simplified to goyogarr. This boundary
must be considered different from that discussed above between particle and suffix, in
that geminate clusters are not found here.
  Degemination may be stated informally: that wherever a cluster of two identical stops
or nasals occurs, it tends to be reduced, but is not necessarily reduced at the particle-suffix
boundary. As mentioned, in 3.5.1., it will be seen that the cluster dd invariably reduces,
at the boundary between pronominal prefix and verb root; and that clusters of jj which
may arise at nominal stem and suffix boundary also reduce. Clusters of both kinds arise
from other processes which remain to be discussed; relevant to the rise of jj clusters is
the process of final syllable reduction in nominal stems (3.4.), which may leavey stem-
final. So far, the evidence suggests that only two boundary types are needed to account
for invariable versus facultative degemination. These will be represented, wherever it is
useful to distinguish them, as ~ (where degemination is facultative) and / (invariant
degemination).
  Now let us return to the question of underlying sequences of nn in the pronominal prefix
forms to the verb.
  In a small number of prefixes, it appears plausible and formally justifiable, by analogy
with other forms, to posit an underlying prefix structure which contains instances ofn-n,
where the first is an accusative marker within the prefix paradigm, the second, the initial
sonorant of a small number of«- initial pronominal prefixes which may occur following
the accusative marker. In all these forms, only a single n is realized, and so we may
assume a process of reduction. Examples of such forms are: 2SG                > 1NSG (second
person singular acting on first person nonsingular, see 6.6.2) /yi-n-gu-n-ni-/, to be
analyzed as 1 Exclusive marker, accusative, plural marker, accusative, 2SG; surface form
yin.gini-; 2NSG              > 1NSG /yi-n-gu-n-nu-/ (1EX, accusative, plural marker,
accusative, 2 person), with actual form yunggunu-. This posited degemination is
28 Chaptersrestricted to the pronominal prefixes; for as we shall see (3.4.1.), where prefix-final n
precedes verb stem initial n, a different set of phonological processes occurs.","[50, 51, 52]"

       17. Noun phrase structures Type(l)         Type(2)           Type (3a)             (3b)            (3c)       type       4    NP             NP                               NP              NP              NP             NP

  In Type 1, the noun phrase consists of a single lexical noun or personal pronoun, and
there is no phrase-internal syntax.
  Type 2 has a clause-level constituent, and is a cover term for the general subordinate
clause type discussed in 8.15., and for the complex particle and nominalized verbal
complementizers which are discussed in Chapter 11. As is noted there, such
complements tend to be syntactically truncated, with minimal overt specification of
participants, with the exception of the allative-marked object of a complement (11.7.).
  Several sub-types of head-attribute construction are shown in 3. 3(a) stands for the
common construction in which a demonstrative modifies the head; as noted above, and
further discussed in 10.9 below, there is variation is ordering of the elements, but ageneral
tendency for most demonstratives to precede the modified, most of the time. 3(b) stands
for a number of other sub-types, in which an interrogative, indefinite or other qualifier
modifies the head, and there may be some kind of adverbial modifying element. Type
3(c) stands for the possessive phrase, of several particular types as discussed: possessor
expressed by genitive pronoun (tending to precede the head), by dative pronoun
following it, or both together flanking it; or nominal possessor expressed by dative-
marking on the possessor and agreement with an independent dative pronoun. Finally, 4
represents a coordinate noun phrase structure which may now be considered briefly.
  It is common enough for semantically and syntactically related noun phrases to occur
on separate tone units, each one in some way adding information to the others. For
example, in a myth concerning porcupine, her husband goes out hunting and runs into
some birds, one kind of which, manamanagban (honeyeater?) is explicitly mentioned:
'He caught up to the honeyeaters, they were calling to him'. The tale continues:(599) ngawurnen     manamanagban
      many-ABS      honeyeater-ABS
      'Many honeyeaters'
244 Chapter 10        golorog-bari              wejbu-ma
        peaceful dove-NOM         mix-PS
        'together with peaceful doves'.
  There is no question that such are to be seen as separate phrases, and indeed the
identification and qualification of participants in separate tone units in this way is a
regular feature of Wardaman texts. Whether phrases in separate tone units refer to the
same entity in different ways, or designate different entities which in many instances may
be construed as having the same role within the text as above, it is out of the question to
regard these as sub-parts of the same phrase.
  However, it is also common for nouns to occur together within the same tone unit,
identically case-marked and sharing a participant role, but without overt coordinator. In
fact, there is little evidence of explicit coordination in Wardaman. It would seem that
such elements as the ""focal member of pair"" suffix (5.6.1.) imply coordination, even
though the second member of the pair NEED NOT be explicitly designated, but may be
mentioned (as in the example ngabida-warrma nawurla, see (528) above). Coordination
is achieved simply by juxtaposition, and Type 4 allows for this.(600)   gulid-gu       buda-wu        0-yanggi                bogogo     gunya    na_
        green plum-DAT black plum-DAT 3SG-go-PS               hunt       3SG-DISS [now]
        'She went away from her now foraging for green and black plum'.
  A few special issues which relate to coordination are worthy of mention here. There
are some textual examples in which one finds apparently coordinate nouns, identically
marked with case or adverbial ending, but where their having the same grammatical role
within the clause appears counterintuitive. Consider for example in the text Onion, line
30. Here two girls who are preparing food are being cajoled by a man to give him what
they are cooking. One of them hesitates, because of the flirtatious implications of a
woman giving a man cooked food; but the other girl urges her to give it. She does so,
and the man takes the meat, cuts raw onion on top of it, and eats it. The line of interest
is:(601) anyin-barra         layln-barra      0-ngu-ndi          girdibun
      [onion]-ADV         meat-ADV         3SG-eat-PST        finish
        'He ate the meat and onion up'.
  One might expect onion to be marked with the adverbial, comitative ending, for the
idea being conveyed is that he ate the meat WITH onion. But instead, both ""onion"" and
""meat"" are marked with the adverbial ending. Nothing is expressed as direct object.
  Consider another example which is different in some respects, but basically similar in
that an unexpected ""spreading"" of case-marking appears to be involved. In the text
Goyin, there is description of bees depositing eggs in the comb. It is said that the honey
body (yi-nyeyn) extends right up to/towards the ""nose"" of the honey-comb. ""Nose"" is
allative-marked (see 5.2.5.). The lines of interest are reproduced below:
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 245
(602)   yi-nyeyn                   yi-jurn-garr-min
        YI-body-ABS                YI-nose-ALL-ADV
        'The honey body up to/towards the nose'        yi-jum-garr        nan-garr          goyi-warr
        YI-nose-ALL        that-ALL         honey-ALL
        'to the nose ofthat honey'.
  We might expect the apparent possessor (or whole of which yijurn is a part), goyin
'honey', to be dative marked. Instead we find that it is allative marked like ""nose"".
Another instance of similar kind can be seen in the text Elsie (46) (see also discussion in
10.4. above, insofar as this last example poses questions about ""classifying""
constructions).
  These have the appearance of 'coordinate' phrases like the one exemplified in (600),
but present an anomaly in that commonly marked nominals would seem to have different
semantic case roles in the clause. Evidently these are instances of the ""spread"" of case-
and adverbial marking across a number of co-occurring nominal constituents.","[267, 268, 269]"
"7.5.8. Indefinite suffix -wardaAnother suffix which contributes a slightly different tone than -gula and -gan is -\varda.
This cannot be properly described as just an interrogative suffix, although it is very
common with interrogative words and phrases. It is a more general flavouring element
of the ""interpersonal"" dimension, and expresses either broad and slightly querulous
interrogation of the ""what in the world?"" kind (i.e., which suggests that the event or thing
is unusual, there may be a wide, unforeseen range of possible answers, and the like), and
often (with non-interrogative elements) a tone of exasperation or end-of-tether. Where
it leaves open a wide range of possibilities, it is often best translated indefinitely,
""somewhere/something-or-other"", and the like. A sizeable set of examples is given to
help establish the range of this suffix. Note from some of these that -warda is final,
occurring after any non-zero nominal or other affixes.",[184]
"3.5.2. Fortition of/w/Fortition applies to two important instances of basic /w/ which are stopped to b after
nasals, as well as to one morphologically minor one. Elsewhere these instances are
realized as w. The suffixes concerned are future tense /wa/, third person nonsingular
pronominal prefix /wu/, and a nominal derivational suffix /widi/.
  Because of stem structure and the details of tense formation, future tense suffix /wa/
may only occur in two morpho-phonological environments: following a vowel, or
following the reflexive-reciprocal marker. Ordinarily, the shape of this marker is /yi/:
ya-wu-rr-bu-yi-n 'they are hitting each other, fighting with each other'. However, before
the future tense suffix, all forms which have the reflexive or reciprocal marker are
characterized by the presence of -ng- after it, i.e., the sequence -yl-ng-. Following this
nasal, and because of assimilation of the suffix vowel to the previous /i/, the shape of the
future tense marker is -be. Thus: ya-\vu-rr-bu-yi-ng-be 'they are going to hit each other,
fight'. This illustrates fortition in the post-nasal environment.
  An alternative way of describing the facts would be to simply list two allomorphs of
the future suffix as post-vocalic -wa and as -ngbe in the environment of the reflexive-
reciprocal marker, that is, treating the latter as a morphological irregularity rather than
as a phonological process. There seems to be little to recommend one description over
the other, except that the second affix, to be described, may be seen as similarly
undergoing fortition following a nasal.
  The second hardening of/w/to b involves the prefixal element nonsingular third person
/wu/. Because of its possible positioning within the prefix complex, /wu/ either occurs
in a post-vocalic environment, occurs initially, or follows the accusative-marking
36 Chapter 3element -n-. In the former two environments it is realized as wit; in the latter, the initial
semivowel is hardened in the realization bu. An example of this process is in the morpho-
phonological form 3NSG            » 1SG Inga-n-wu-rrl (1SG, accusative, 3NSG, plural),
which is realized as nganburr-. The third instance is that of a rather rare suffix /widi/
(9.8.), which is found, for example, to create a nominal yarrbaly-widi from a particle
yarrbaly 'make a nuisance'. Following a nasal-final particle such asjangang 'persist in
saying to, asking', we fmdjangang-bidi 'persistent'.
  The question may be raised whether it is reasonable to take the semivowel-initial forms
of the morphemes under discussion as basic. Could the processes be alternatively viewed
as lenition? This seems counterintuitive first, in the case of nonsingular /wu/ because it
is realized in that shape word-initially, where there is no argument for treating this as a
leniting environment; and in the case of future /wa/, because that is the ""elsewhere""
realization apart from the environment following unpredictable -ng- after the reflexive-
reciprocal marker. Below (3.7.) are discussed two other processes which have
realizations as \v, but which must be described as differently conditioned from the
instances we have just seen. For this reason the basic segment in the suffixes described
here is treated as /w/, which undergoes stopping to b after nasals.
P-6 /w/-Fortition
     /w/         > b / [+ Nasal]
  Conditions: morphemes to which this applies are future suffix /wa/, 3NSG /wu/, and
/widi/. Conditioning nasals in the first two instances are -ng- following the reflexive-
reciprocal, and -n- accusative marker.","[59, 60]"
"
4.2. Nominals: Pronouns, nouns, demonstratives, and
     interrogatives""Nominal"" is the cover term used for a broad class of lexical items which can inflect for
case and certain other categories. Within the class of nominals, several sub-classes will
be identified. The syntactic patterning of all sub-classes tends to be Ergative-Absolutive
where there is an object marked on the verb (even if 3SG zero), but occasional instances
are found in text in which transitive agent nominals are not Ergative-marked.
  Pronouns are those nominals which refer to speech-situation participants, and some
which can index (emphatically, anaphorically) other nominals. There are many formal
similarities between the independent pronominal stems, and the affixal pronominal forms
obligatorily prefixed to the verb to indicate participant identities.
  Demonstrative pronouns are a nominal sub-class which make reference in terms of
graded distance or location categories calibrated primarily in relation to the speech
situation (there are three such degrees marked by Wardaman demonstrative morphology,
and a whole host of formally related terms, ""this side"", ""that side"", etc.). One term in the
three-term spatial system, called Proximate, also serves to indicate textual recoverability.
Its forms are thus far more frequent than are those of the other two demonstrative
categories.
  Interrogative pronouns are nominals with which different kinds of questions are
formed: ""what"", ""where"", ""who"". Secondarily, they function in the construction of
negative and indefinite arguments (""nobody"", ""somebody"").
  Number words belong to the class of nominals. There are three numbers, lege One',
guyamin 'two', and murrgun 'three'. Beyond that ngawurnen indicates 'many, a large
number'. Number words may function as modifiers, or as noun phrase heads in their own
right.
  Finally, there is a large class that will simply be called ""nominals"" in general, but which
comprehends what would be called ""nouns"" and ""adjectives"" in conventional part-of-
58 Chapter 4 speech terms. In dictionary entries and glosses, for the most part a distinction has been
 made between the former (""N"") and the latter (""NADJ"")· This is not because the
 distinction can be satisfactorily sustained for all purposes (see below), but because it
 partly captures some distributional and functional differences within the class.
   Some nominals, the notionally more adjectival ones like ""empty"", ""tough"", ""raw""
 ""crooked"", ""long"", ""good"" and so on, are more likely to function predicatively than are
 what might be called argument nominals such as ""goanna"" (lizard),""woman"", and ""duly
 bag"" (string bag). The more adjectival are regularly causativized and inchoativized,
 while the argument nominals are not regularly so treated. Here, however, the distinction
 is not absolute, for some of them which might be considered towards the attributive end
 of a nominal-feature spectrum, and also some which designate persons in terms of age-
 statuses, for example, are found to be so treated. For example, a noun which typically
occurs as argument, meaning such things as ""plain, flat place"" (as opposed to ""flat"" in
general), may be causativized. A noun such as ""man"" may, also. Finally, the more
adjectival are commonly found in modifying function, while the others are not.
   While a degree of distinctiveness thus can be identified between notionally adjectival
and other nominals, in Wardaman as in many other Australian languages (and regional
ones, including Wardaman's putative congeners, see Cook 1987: 88), the formerare not
limited to predicative and modifying functions, but also regularly function as arguments.
In Wardaman, their functioning as arguments is implemented with the help of the overt
nominal class markers which are prefixed to nominals of the adjectival sort, and create
forms the general kind of reference of which is indicated by the class marker, and the
more specific denotation of which is understood in terms of the ""property-like""
designation of the adjectival stem. Such forms may function syntactically as modifiers,
but equally, they may function as arguments in their own right. The difference between
the two different notional types is fluid enough so that stems of the more adjectival kind,
class-prefixed, may come to be regular designators of (kinds of) referents which have
the particular property. For example, the adjectival stem barnbamin means 'naked,
hairless'; with animate class prefix, the formyi-barnbarnin is used to mean 'buffalo'. To
give a second example, the adjectival stem langman means 'clear, cleared'; with class
prefix, the form wu-langman is taken to mean 'clear space, clear area', and case-inflected
forms of it are commonly used without any (other) argument noun, e.g., wu-langma-warr
'to a clearing, clear place' (allative-marked).
   Another general difference between notionally ""argument"" and adjectival nominals is
that most of the former tend to regularly occur with only one class prefix (if any, for there
are argument nouns like bangbun 'woman' which never take overt class prefix). For
example, most body parts take the class prefix yi-, and tend to occur only with that prefix,
not with any other. On the other hand, most of the notionally adjectival nominals may
be freely prefixed with the range of class markers, something which changes their
understood designation. There are some indeterminacies here too, however (see 5.1. for
more detail), so relatively fixed versus variable class-marking of nominals can only be
taken as a general guide. The point in distinguishing between N and NADJ at all is not
to saddle the language with untenable distinctions, but rather to try to capture some of
the privilege-of-occurrence tendencies which are evident in Wardaman.
                                                                            Word classes 59
43. Finite verbsVerbs obligatorily are marked for either subject alone, or for subject and object. A
maximum of two participant slots can be filled by pronominal prefixes. Other participant
roles are marked on external nominals but nowhere on the verb. Categories of tense,
mood and aspect are marked on the verb in the main by suffixation, but also (primarily
in respect of a mood distinction between realis and irrealis) by prefixes. Weak
subordination and other kinds of clause-level relations are expressed by suffixation to
finite verb forms.
  Wardaman has at least 130 fairly common finite verbs (unlike Wakiman, which appears
to have only around forty, Cook 1987: 90). Among these are eight very high-frequency
CV verbs, a number of which can also occur as inseparable auxiliaries of compound verb
stems, e.g., bu- occurs as a verb in its own right meaning 'hit', but also as auxiliary in
banybu- 'to fill receptacle', dembu- 'to peck', werrenybu- 'to ensorcell', gardbu- 'to
wipe', and so on. Several classes of such ""compound verbs"" can be identified according
to the verb root. There are also many finite verbs which have a simple, i.e., non-
compound, stem, e.g., bewe- 'to tread on', gorno- 'to fill', gene- 'to taste', and others.
Most finite verbs can occur with one or more ""verb particles"" to yield particular
meanings, while some finite verbs occur independently with full lexical meaning e.g.,
waja- means 'to leave', and is often used without particle; but may occur with particles
to create other meanings, such as narru waja- 'to dodge (weapons)'.","[81, 82, 83]"
"12.3.3. Ngala 'but'The next two conjunctions to be discussed fall into the Halliday and Hasan category of
""adversative"". That is, the kind of linkage they express is that something following is
disjunct or different from something that has gone before. (In 12.2.1. we saw that the
particle bajawinyin usually seems to have an adversative nuance.) The first conjunction
of this kind to be discussed here is the stronger of the two, and is best glossed in most of
its uses as ""but"", but as examples will show, the disjunction need not be quite as radical
as that ordinarily signalled by English ""but"". It is usually clause-initial.(786) ngan.gu-la-rri              ngala    yinyang               yimbu-la-rri

2.5. Syllable and word shapeSyllable shapes CV and CVC(C) are the most common, the full form of the latter found,
for example, in words such as those illustrated above with a triple cluster across
morpheme boundary, where the syllable boundary occurs between CVCC and following
C, gaygSbarla. The syllable shape V is found only in the sole vowel-initial word, tag-
question particle ale, and phonetically, where the initial glide of nominal class markers
is reduced (see 2.1.). The syllable shape CCV is found ingle (occurring forms syllabified
e.g., yi$gle 'putrid flesh'), and lo$wa$glo$wa 'play' (often with some reduction of the
glides).
  A phonological word in Wardaman may consist of one syllable, closed or open (CVC
or CV), though so far no nominal stems of the latter shape have been found. Verb roots
of shape CV are common, and some paradigmatic forms of such roots (imperative) have
this shape. Disyllabic words, aside from the single particle ale, may be described by the
options CV(C)CV(C). Lexical stems of five syllables, based on the repetition of syllable
types as given, are common. There are some over five syllables, but in such, a lexical
derivational element of some kind (whether productive or not) can be recognized.

                              Process phonology
3.1. IntroductionAmong the major phonological processes are: a pervasive but variable final syllable
reduction in nominal stems before non-zero affixes; alternations among stops, glides and
nasals in a number of affixes, mainly suffixes marking case, number, and a few other
derivational and inflectional categories; alternations which apply within pronominal
prefixes to the verb, and at the boundary between those prefixes and the initial segment
of the following verb root. Some low-level assimilatory processes apply to consonants
and vowels. Many of the latter are regressive and progressive effects of mid-vowels Id
and /o/ on /a/ occurring in verbal pronominal prefixes, tense/mood suffixes, and a small
number of other suffixes. Some automatic aspects of segmental surface realizations, such
as the regular loss of initial retroflexion in some environments (see 2.2.), need to be
briefly discussed.
  Rather less predictably, some nasal segments are found in verbal morphology where
they cannot be accounted for by any regular phonological process. One instance involves
forms of the highly irregular verb ""to go"". All of these occurrences of nasals can only
be described as morpho-phonological irregularities (3.10.).
  Finally, there are some interesting and quite general reduplicative processes.
  This chapter includes brief discussion of word-level stress patterns.","[48, 49]"

10.9. Variant ordering in DEM + N phrasesIn 10.3 it was said that the most common ordering of demonstrative and specified noun
is DEM + N. It was also noted that such phrases containing the forms of the Proximate
demonstrative nana are of particularly high frequency, since that category has the
function of signaling the textual recoverability of the entity, and is perhaps most
comparable to the English definite article (see 7.2. for illustration). But recoverability in
general does not completely coincide with the identification in context of which
particular recoverable entity is being referred to. Let us consider some instances of the
variant order with the Proximate category, N + DEM, since it would appear to be
associated with and one of the means of clarifying which recoverable or given noun
phrase within the information unit is meant, by signalling a break in the flow.
  In certain instances where two protagonists have been spoken about, the variant order
seems to be associated with a shift from one to the other.
  In the Onion text, line 65 we have an instance of marluga nana. Two men have been
discussing the illness of one of them who ate food prepared by two girls. The other man
suggests to him that he has been ensorcelled, and he agrees. ""I dreamt about them"" (63),
""about the two of them giving me onion, he says"" (64). At that point the other old man
calls out to the girls and tells them to rub the victim with fat. It is at that point in line
(65) that the phrase in question occurs, and appears to be associated with a transition
from the speaker quoting the victim, to the other old man asserting his authority over the
girls and telling them to cure him. Note that the ""other"" old man re-introduced at this
point is grammatically the subject of an intransitive verb (""call to"") which takes dative
complement.
  In the text Mejern, between lines (93) and (98) there is a similar shift in transition
between two recoverable characters. An old Aboriginal man identified as the father of
246 Chapter 10Micky Bennett was hiding along the river (92) and saw a white man shooting Aborigines
(93). For several dozen lines the speaker has been talking about shooting by whites, not
individually identifiable but only known as associated with local stations. A chief interest
of this part of the story is the identifiability of particular Aborigines and their exploits in
the face of European violence. Having seen the white (or whites) shooting (93), the old
Aboriginal man spears his horse out from under him (94-97), and he falls. Line (98)
begins with the variant order memden nana, perhaps associated with the transition from
the previous few lines in which the old Aboriginal man is the assumed agent (ellipsed in
97). A similar shift occurs between about lines (99) and (104). In (99), the old Aborigine
runs up to the white and stabs him, ""with a tommyhawk"" (100), ""stab"" (101), and runs
away up on top (of the hills) (102-103). Line 104 says: mernden nana gud gajurri 'the
white man stood up'. That is, both are recoverable as nana signals, but I hypothesize that
the variant order may be associated with the signalling of a shift among recoverable items,
specifically to one that has receded slightly into the narrative background.","[269, 270]"
"  ""Where"" may be Originative-suffixed to question provenance (as place of birth), or
recent provenance, even occurring in construction with a Source-suffixed nominal, as in
the phrasegudang-jila wu-jaba-wunba 'from which house?'",[180]
"
1.3. Linguistic typeWardaman is both prefixing and suffixing. It has relatively complex nominal and verbal
morphology. There are three overt nominal class markers (yi-, ma- and WM-), at least the
first two of which are used to designate fairly unified sets of denotata. Most noun stems
occur only with prefix of one particular class (e.g., yi-biyan 'man, person, Aborigine');
but some may occur with more than one, producing lexical difference (yi-mum 'eye',
wu-mum 'nipple'). As well, there are many nouns which occur without prefix (i.e., with
0- prefix), but with which modifiers (adjectival nouns) may exhibit overt concord.
  Number and case are marked by suffixes, and the syntactic case system tends to be
fairly strongly Ergative-Absolutive. However, there is wide use of a clause type with
actor subject (not generally Ergatively-marked if represented by an independent
nominal), and objective complement marked by Dative case. As well, there are various
one-place (fully intransitive) clause types. Overt suffix categories include
Ergative/Instrumental, Dative/ Genitive, local cases Allative, Locative and Ablative, and
the semantically most restricted local category, Originative. In addition, there are two
morphologically composite case categories, historically built on the Dative. The first,
an historical composite of Dative plus Locative, is termed Dissociative, and usually
expresses the meaning ""from"" or ""away from"" of an animate participant, or ""on account
of of a wider range of participant types. The second, historical composite of Dative and
Ablative, expresses a range of notions including source and cause, and is labelled Source.
  Participants are obligatorily marked by pronominal prefixes in the verb, and
secondarily by independent pronouns. A maximum of two participants are indicated in
the verb by transitive prefix forms that tend to be portmanteaux, i.e., not neatly
segmentable into parts representing each person/number that enters into the combination.
  In the expression of verbal meanings, there is a basic distinction between inflecting
verbs and what I have called free verb ""particles"". It is common in linguistic descriptions
for the word ""particle"" to be used to designate non-inflecting parts of speech. In
Wardaman what I call ""particles"" can take some inflections. The term ""particle"" in this
sense, however, has had currency in Australianist studies for some time (see Dixon ed.
1976), and I retain it, but place emphasis on describing the possibilities of inflection, and
the important syntactic functions of these elements. ""Verb particles"" are semantically
full, and occur in combination with a small number of high-frequency inflecting roots
(including a number of significant ones of shape CV). Where such particle and verb
combinations are highly regular in a specific verbal meaning, the construction is
generally labelled that of Particle plus Auxiliary in this description. However, it is
                                                                               Introduction 5
significant that here, seemingly more than in some other regional languages which have
this general construction type (e.g., Mangarrayi), the ""AUX"" often transparently has
some clear semantic commonality with the particle, and thus cannot be regarded simply
as a formal mechanism or bearer of inflections. For example, with the particle gayardung
'run', most common are the motion verbs ya- 'go' and nyanga- 'come'. These of course
partly function as grammatical ""auxiliaries"", in that they bear person and verbal
categorial inflections; but transparently, they are semantically integral with the particle.
The clear kind of semantic integration in this case contrasts with that, say, between the
particle wululu and its usual ""AUX"" we-, which may occur by itself in the meaning 'fall,
be born'. However, together, the combination wululu we- means 'enter, go inside' (not
""fall in"" or the like). That is, there is no clear semantic ""transparency"" of the AUX in
the latter case, and thus a greater idiomaticity to the combination than to those with
gayardung. Thus, the label Particle plus AUX is applied to combinations which may
differ considerably in their internal semantic relations. The diverse nature of
combinations within this construction type is clearly of comparative interest, and this
labelling should not by any means disguise the fact that, as noted above, ""AUX"" is a
semantically and functionally flexible, diverse and problematic category.
  Particles have a wide syntactic range. They may be inflected for nominal categories
(case), and occur in non-predicative construction types as nominals, and as modifiers.
Paradigms of inflecting verbs tend to be highly regular: there is a very limited amount
of suffixal allomorphy for tense/aspect/mood categories. The one thoroughly irregular
paradigm is that of the verb ""to go"".
  Suffixal categories of the verb include Present, Past, Future, and Potential, that is,
express tense and in some instances, tense/mood meanings. An Admonitive (""lest"")
construction is generally built on a zero-stem form, or is built on the Future stem in the
few verbs where this is a formally distinct (and obviously historically moribund)
category. Further tense/aspect meanings (e.g., iterative) are expressed by additional
suffixation to verb forms inflected for tense/aspect, and in some instances (Habitual) by
special prefix forms.
  A basic mood distinction between Realis and Irrealis categories is expressed by verbal
prefixation, in combination (in some instances) with differences in the bound pronominal
forms which express person/number as between the two mood categories.
  Weak subordination of one predication to another is a common means of constructing
discourse linkage in Wardaman. There are two sets of subordinators, one expressing
non-past, the other past, temporal reference. Another important mechanism of textual
cohesion is ""de-focusing"" of overtly occurring NPs, i.e., marking of them as recoverable
and thus cohesive with surrounding linguistic context.
  Three deictic ""degrees"" are distinguished in the demonstrative system, with some
irregularity in the paradigms. The spatially intermediate category (not ""this""and not
""yonder"", but proximate ""that"") also serves to indicate textual recoverability, and is thus
most closely comparable to the English definite article.
  There are five main points of articulation of parallel stop-nasal series: labial, apico-
alveolar, apico-domal or retroflex, lamino-palatal, and velar. There are laterals at three
of these points of articulation, apico-alveolar, apico-domal, and lamino-palatal. The
6 Chapter 1 lamino-palatal lateral has a very limited distribution. There are retroflex glide and tap
 alveolar rhotics. While there are five vowels /, e, u, o and a, the mid-vowels do not
 occur in any of the inflectional morphology, except as the result of low-level assimilatory
processes. The mid-vowels do, however, occur in a small number of important
derivational morphemes, and they occur freely in the wider lexicon.
   There are no vowel clusters in Wardaman, and no vowel-initial morphemes besides the
 tag-question particle ale 'isn't that so?'.
   There appears to be little intra-language variation, but minor differences in a few lexical
items were noted among speakers.
   Like Warlmanpa to the south (see Nash 1990), Wardaman speak of different territorial
sub-groupings, to which recruitment is normatively in the male line, as having different
madin 'languages', or 'words'. Each such identifiable grouping is said to have
minimally one, sometimes more, special words that are ""their"" language. Typically, these
are said to be either the sound made by, or the language spoken by, principal mythological
figures saliently associated with given Wardaman sub-territories. For example, an
important mythological association with the sub-country just west of Willeroo Station
homestead running westerly to Garnawala (Mount Hogarth) is gulirrida 'peewees',
which are abundantly represented in some of the spectacular rock paintings in this area.
The ""language"" or ""word"" of the peewees, and therefore of the grouping of people
patrifiliated to this area, is said to be mamundajgani, a form for which no etymology can
be given. A few of the ""words"" for particular sub-groupings may have etymologies in
other languages of the Victoria River area. At least one is clearly onomatopoetic (e.g.,
standardization of a bird cry). Knowledge of this kind of relation among people, territory
and salient ""word"" or ""words"" is limited to older people. The madin 'words' about which
there appeared to be wide agreement were: mamundajgani, cited above; ngagandoroj,
the ""word'Of menngen 'white cockatoo', a major dreaming around the Innesvale Station
homestead area; yidabu and wamanga, words associated with warrija 'crocodile'
dreaming, localized at Mt. Gregory; and nenene, a ""word' (imitative of a bird cry) of
bulyan 'eagle', associated with Jalad, or Price's Creek, area. The words associated with
""crocodile"" are interesting, and either have etymologies in other Victoria River
languages, or apparently in any case connote the meanings ""beef, meat"" and ""hit, strike""
(Wardaman deb 'hit, belt' was used to gloss wamanga), both principal elements of the
myth associated with Mt. Gregory, the principal characters of which, Warrura and
Barnangga, fought over a catch of crocodile. In addition, a dilygun 'possum' dreaming
associated with the high country along Mathison Creek is characterized by a particular
style of speaking, with stopped nasal segments similar to the speech of a person trying
to talk with a blocked nose. Thus, possum says dadadi instead of danani 'this one'.
Asked about these ""languages"" or ""words"", people will emphasize that they are all ""one"",
the ""same Wardaman"", that is, are socio-territorial distinctions made by people who share
a common language in the linguist's usual sense.
   Among other systems of social relationship, Wardaman people recognize several
(equatable) sets of subsection (or ""eight-class"") terms, but identify only one of these as
""proper"" Wardaman. That set is given in 5.13. They also recognize matrifiliatively
transmitted recruitment to groupings commonly called ngurlu across the Victoria River
                                                                                   Introduction 7
region. These groupings are not localized. Among my Wardaman informants, most
belonged to one or other of the ngurlu: goyin 'sugarbag', ganben 'flying fox', warrag
'catfish', yiburu 'black rain', and yiwaganga 'rain'. While some of these are specifically
Wardaman words (e.g., goyin), certain of the names (e.g., yiburu) have wider currency
across the region, and cannot be considered only Wardaman.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
"8.17. TransitivityThere is a clear difference between canonical transitive and intransitive clause structures
in Wardaman, the former characterized by the presence of two pronominal adjuncts in
the verb, and by the subject pronominal corresponding to an independent Ergative-
marked, semantically agentive nominal; the latter, by the presence of one pronominal
adjunct.
                                                                 Categories of the finite verb 203  However, a bipartite transitive-intransitive division of both clauses and verbs is
unsatisfactory. Let us consider clause types first, and here it becomes apparent that it is
useful to recognize at least three major ones, and at least one minor one.
  An intransitive clause may be defined as one with one pronominal verb prefix (Table
16, Type 1). Various kinds of complements may occur in the intransitive clause, none of
which is marked in the verb, e.g., a clause with predicate of motion may have a
Dissociative nominal complement, 0-yanggi gunya ' he went away from him', a location
complement of some kind, and so on.
  The canonical transitive clause is one in which there are two pronominal adjuncts, one
of which may be linked to an independent Ergative-marked nominal (that is, if this is
present), while the other represents the direct object category (Type 3). There is a
ditransitive clause type, which only a few predicates may realize, in which the two
pronominal adjuncts represent the semantic agent and the semantic indirect object (Type
4).
Table 16. Types of Noun-Verb Relations                   Noun                                  Verb
1                  ABSi                                  SUBJj
2                  ABSi+ DATj                            SUBJi
3                  ABSj+ ERGj                            SUBJj+ OBJj
4                  ABSj+ ERGj+ DATk                      SUBj + OBJk   This leaves the question of how one may regard the common Absolutive-Dative clause
Type 2 in Wardaman, i.e., that in which there is one pronominal adjunct to the verb, a
semantic agent, and a Dative (often, semantically benefactive) clausal argument function
which cannot be encoded on the verb, but may be expressed by independent nominal
phrase, commonly a pronominal. If one takes the presence of verbal pronominal prefixes
as definitional, this clause type is to be regarded as intransitive. But if one defines the
clause type in terms of predicate semantics and argument roles, such a clause-type would
better be regarded as two-place, rather than one-place (intransitive) with possible
additional complements. The agent nominal, if present in such clauses, is over-
whelmingly Absolutive, although it may occasionally be Ergative-marked
  One might also recognize as a distinct sub-type the clause with one pronominal adjunct
which is a semantic agent or experiencer, in which there may be an Instrumental phrase
expressing the semantic cause or source. The archetypal predicate which occurs in this
clause type in Wardaman is ba- 'bum, perish', often with Instrumental niarninggam-yi
'sun'. As with other intransitives, there is an optional purposive (formally Dative)
argument position ""for which"" that may occur with this predicate, e.g., nga-ba-n wiya-wu
'I'm thirsty for water'. But the really distinctive things about this clause type are, first,
the presence of the semantically agentive nominal phrase which cannot be marked on
the verb, but instead is realized as Instrument; and the encoding of the sole semantically
patientive nominal by subject form-class in the verb.
  It seems out of keeping with the structural diversity of clause types, then, to simply
recognize a distinction between transitive and intransitive clauses. We may more
204 Chapter 8usefully recognize (at least) the types shown in Table 16. Some further minor types may
also be identified on both semantic and formal grounds; e.g., that described in the
preceding paragraph; the mediopassive construction; and as will be seen below, a
construction type might be recognized for which a label ""medioactive"" might be coined,
to handle the case of a some predicate (particle plus verb) phrases which mainly designate
weather conditions.
  If it is not useful to recognize a simple bipartite division of clauses, it is also not
completely satisfactory to recognize a bipartite division of verbs, for at least two reasons.
The first is that the transitivity value of finite verbs as sole predicate constituent, and as
member of a particle plus verb construction, may be and often is different. There is a
large number of particle plus verb combinations, in which the finite verbs are the same
ones that generally occur elsewhere as predicates of transitive clauses. With some
particles, however, they do not determine transitive clause structure. For example, the
finite verb gi-, by itself, is transitive, or the predicate basis of transitive clauses. With
the particle mllid 'show', however, it takes only one pronominal adjunct, and any indirect
object, ""person shown to"", is a Dative-marked nominal which cannot be encoded in the
verb; thus its argument structure is of the Absolutive-Dative kind. In combination with
other particles, such as denberr 'hang up, suspend', gi- is the basis of transitive clause
structure.
  In the same way the verb root bu- may occur in transitive and other clause types
depending upon its occurrence as sole predicate, versus its particular lexical combination
with given particles. Although bu- as sole verbal constituent is transitive, in the particle
plus verb combinationyMrd^a) bu- 'to show to' it occurs in the Absolutive-Dative clause
type, and any ""person shown to"" must be Dative-marked outside the verb.
  The root bu- is particularly common in particle plus verb combinations which designate
weather conditions, and clauses of this kind show no evidence of being structurally
transitive. For example, in clauses with the particle plus verb combinations jurrg(ba)
bu- 'sprinkle, rain lightly', and larrawardba bu- 'to break' (of day), there is no syntactic
indication of transitivity:(482)   galulul ya-0-wudba            marlnga          jurrg-ba     ya-0-bu-n-ga
        toprdp 3-3SG-throw           cloud-ABS         sprinkle     3-3SG-AUX-PRES-SUB
        'Way high up clouds form when it sprinkles'.
  There has never been found to be an explicitly agentive nominal which may occur with
this combination, although the ""cognate"" nominal wiyan 'rain', in Absolutive form, may
co-occur.(483)   larraward-ba        ya-0-bu-n                  maminggani
        break-PS            3-3SG-AUX-PRES             sun-ABS
        'The day is breaking'.
  The Absolutive form of ""sun"" in propositions with this combination may be taken as
an indication that it is formally intransitive (i.e., one-place). It might, as suggested above,
be useful to recognize this as a distinct predicate class, for bu- otherwise typically occurs
                                                                   Categories of the finite verb 205
in transitive or Absolutive-Dative clause types. Combinations of bu- with other particles,
such as bag 'break', yield transitive clause structures.
  Likewise, the verb na- 'see' is ordinarily transitive (ngawun-da-n Ί see them'), but
occurs in a formally intransitive clause structure with the particle lag(ba), meaning as a
whole 'to dry up, become dessicated'; in this combination, it is partly synonymous with
the combination lag(ba) ngegba- 'to die and dry up', where ngegba- normally, as sole
predicative constituent, occurs in intransitive clause structure.
  The second kind of evidence that militates against a strict transitive-intransitive
distinction at the level of the predicate is the fact that one important predicate, yana- 'say,
do' is found used both transitively and intransitively. Clauses with this predicate tend to
be structured transitively first, where there is a jussive complement of ""commanding
that"" (see 477 above), or second, of ""saying to that"" with complement clause not one of
directly reported speech, in which case the person told may be treated as direct object:(484)   ngan-yana-rri              ya-0-nyangi-we                yiwarna         wiyan
        3SG/lSG-say-PST            3-3SG-come-FUT                next            rain
        'She told me she will come next year'.
  Note that this amounts to the possibility of ""indirect"" report, i.e., the report is not framed
as direct speech, but rather as a summary of what was said, or as indirect speech.
Transitive usage of the verb also is common where what is said is a nominal ""cognate
object"" of speech of some kind, and not necessarily a complement clause:(485) nganburr-yana-rri-ya                    madin
      3NSG/lSG-say-PST-NAR                    word-ABS
        'They gave me knowledge', in the sense 'they imparted information'.
 Intransitive usage tends to correspond to the function ""tell to"", ""say to"" or ""relate to"",
where the complement is a clause of reported (direct) speech:(486) dana-ni-wan         0-yana-rri          nganu
      this-ART-DF         3SG-say-PST         1SG-DAT
        ""This is the one"", she said to me'.
  The same possibility of variable transitivity exists with the particle plus verb
combination yang(ma) bu- 'tell, inform'. Ί informed them' may be either yang
nga-bu-ndi wurrugu or yang ngawun-bu-ndi, and either may have a full linked clause
(either independent or subordinate in form) specifying the content of the report. Textual
examples were recorded in which the particle jurd-(ba) 'show, indicate', which normally
occurs with finite verb bu- in Absolutive-Dative clause-type such that any ""person shown
to"" must be put into Dative case, alternatively occurs with constructionally transitive
yana-, as indicated by the fact that the one to whom something is shown is marked by
object pronominal form in the verb. (For a parallel difference in transitivity of the ""say""
verb in Wakiman, see Cook 1987: 221.)
206 Chapter 8   Given the evidence presented here of the inadequacy of a bipartite transitive-
intransitive distinction at either clause- or predicate-level, we nevertheless capture
something significant about the language by noting that there tends to be congruence
between particular verbs as sole predicative constituent and particular clause types, i.e.,
bu- as sole predicate normally occurs in transitive clauses. Further, predicates which as
sole constituent function transitively also, in combination with particles, commonly
occur in Absolutive-Dative clause structures; but predicates which function intransitively
as sole verbal constituent also tend to function intransitively in combination with
particles.
  There is no single process of transitive-intransitive derivation (but see 8.19. on
causatives). Rather the difference between transitive and intransitive predicate meanings
and associated clause structures is generally managed ""lexico-syntactically"", by the
alternation of different finite (auxiliary) verbs with the same particle. Hence, the
difference implemented by such alternation is often not simply a grammatical one relating
to transitivity, but may also involve additional elements of lexical semantics. Below are
listed a number of common alternations of the same particle with different finite verbs,

wurrnmg           me-               we-                'knock over, die'
  This list shows that a common transitive-intransitive pairing is gi-ljingi-, but other
pairings are found As independent predicate gi- means 'put', and jingi- 'sit', but the
latter also has an important copula function (""be, be in a place""), as well as auxiliary
function with particles.
  The sense of some of the pairs listed may be more or less transparent. In some cases
the pair corresponds to a difference in transitivity in clause type, but seemingly without
great semantic difference, e.g., mamaj ngen-me-n 'he beckons me', versus mamaj
ya-0-yana nganu 'he beckons to me', or the like.
  The difference in pairings with wabirl is that between ""peel"" or ""take the skin off,
versus ""come, peel off, fade, fall off, as one might say of paint on the wall or colour in
clothing.
  There are many alternative possible pairings where there is no change in transitivity of
the clause, but rather a semantic difference in the nature of the action predicated. In
Wardaman, this kind of alternation cannot be seen as of formally different kind to the
transitive-intransitive pairings shown above. Some of these alternative pairings give
some insight into verbal lexical semantics. Examples are:
Particle            Verb-1            Verb-2                Gloss(es)

yulun-            me-               wo-                'give in ex change, get'  In some cases we must see the semantics of particle plus verb pairing as rather
compositional, e.g., lag ngegba- 'to die and dry up'; or luglug-ba ba- 'to swell up and
burn'; mun-ma ba- 'to cook in a ground oven, pit'.
208 Chapter 8  From some alternative pairings with me-, it becomes clear that this verb has a central
semantic component in many combinations of ""action by hand"", e.g., dibdib me- 'to
extract, remove' versus dibdib buju- 'to extract, dig out'; birrij bu- 'knead' versus me-
'stir', where the latter is an action more fully implemented with the hand only. It also is
clear that the verbja/α- which by itself is used to mean 'to boomerang', in combinations
expresses a component of meaning ""touch tangentially"", e.g., din.gawurrg bu- 'to hit on
the neck', versus din.gawurrg jala- 'to hit a (glancing) blow on the neck'.","[226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"

11.2. Temporal clauses: -barra ~ -warra with finite verbs and
      particles
Dependent clauses meaning 'when, at the time when' may be formed with the suffix
-barra ~ -warra (see 5.4.) from both verbs and verb particles, but in the latter instance
exhibit some of the usual limitations of complement clauses based on particles.
  Temporal clauses with verbs tend to be used to express background conditions in
relation to another clause or series of them, and thus are often constructed with formally
subordinate predicates, as in this example:(654)   gorromogon        ngarr-gurrgba-n-ga-\varra           ya-wud-janga-yan
        early morning     UNPL-sleep-PRES-SUB-ADV             3-3NSG-come-POT
        ""They may come early in the morning when we are sleeping'.
                                             Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 271  A similar meaning would be expressed by the subordinate verb form without suffix;
but its addition seems to focus on simultaneity of the two actions or conditions expressed
by the predicates of clauses so linked. The suffix may be added to finite verb forms:(655)   nga-njigbe-warra          nana                  ya-0-nyangi-we          yiwarna-gari
        ISG-go-FUT-ADV            that-ABS              3-3SG-come-FUT           other-other
        'When I will go the other fellow will come'.
  The same suffix is added to verb particles, and these function as clause complements:
(1) designating the time at which something took place; or (2) as secondary predicates
with verbs of motion, the kind of action undertaken during or as a result ofthat motion.
In the first usage, the suffix is added to particles designating events, for example:(656)   lilg-ba-warra       barrunin        lag                  0-ngegba-rri
        dryup-ADV           fish-ABS        dessicate            3SG-AUX-PST
        'When it [water] dried, the fish died and dried up'.
  The particle lilg-ba is usually combined with ya- to mean 'dry up', and is often used
in reference to seasonal drying up of water bodies. Such minimal temporal complements
as these differ little from nominals designating seasons and conditions, similarly suffixed,
e.g., wu-jerrij-barra 'when it is cold, in cold-weather time'.
   As secondary predicates with verbs of motion, the complement clause may have a
Dative, semantically direct object, and further nominal complements are also Dative
marked. Common in this function is the particle gej-(ba) 'ask'; as clausal predicate with
finite verb gi~ it takes a direct (animate) object, the person asked.(657)   oliba-wu          0-nyanga-ndi    gej-ba-warra    walbarnda-wu
        [Oliver]-DAT      3SG-come-PST ask-PS-ADV         plain-DAT
        nyangurlang       ya-wu-di-yan            wurren
        when               3-3NSG-bring-POT       child-ABS
        'He came to ask Oliver about the initiation, when they might bring the child'
         [initiand].
  (Here as is often the case, the word meaning ""plain"" or ""flat ground"" is contextually
understood to refer and allude to ""ceremony ground"", and the activity of initiation
conducted there.) Gej-ba-warra has a semantically direct object, the person asked; and
that asked about is also Dative-marked (the nominal ""plain""; the more precise content of
the question is encoded in a clause linked to the preceding by the (usually) interrogative
pronoun ""when"", here functioning as a temporal relativizer.","[294, 295]"
"7.5.7. Question suffix -ganA relatively milder and extremely common interrogative suffix is -gan. By ""milder"" is
meant that its feeling-tone is such that the speaker appears more to be inquiring of himself
or herself, rather than intrusively trying to elicit a response from an interlocutor. This
quality is no doubt linked to the fact that forms with -gan are often of the ""whatchama-
callit"" sort, in which the speaker is seeking to remember something, but is searching for
the missing item himself or herself, and not really expecting anyone else to supply it.
Distributionally, too, -gan differs from -gula in that it may be followed by grammatical
affixes (case-suffixes, etc.), in which case inflections are added to the form -ga-. -gan
forms are most common with ngamanda 'what', yinggiya 'who', and also with the mode
particle (12.2.4.) yilama 'maybe, (X) thinks that':(303)   ma-birral    0-ba-ndi-ya            ngamanda-ga-yi             wurr-ginye-rri-ya

  (309) was said in the context of telling a story about the fear women used to have of
the evil eye, or men's malignant gaze, when they were pregnant. The speaker has
constructed an hypothetical situation, in which a woman had been pregnant for several
months, and she continues as in the example.

10.7. Discontinuous constituency
There are numerous examples in which nominal constituents of groups which occur on
a single tone unit, and might be on semantic and syntactic grounds analyzed as members
of a single noun phrase, nevertheless occur separated from each other, sometimes by a
number of words.(593)   oni    majadmajad               yirr-me-ndi-ya                    mayin
        [only] MA-big-rdp-ABS           lEXNSG-get-PST-NAR                food-ABS
        'We only got big tubers'.
  From the preceding context, ""vegetable food"" seems to be presupposed, while ""big""
appears to be contrastive with ""little ones"" (vegetables) of the preceding tone group. In
the next example, wu-jad 'big' modifies yibumbu 'billycan':(594) yibumbu            yanima-n joy nganburr-wo-ndi-ya-wuya                     wu-jad
      billy-ABS          thus-ABS give 3NSG/lSG-give-PST-NAR-DU                   WU-big-ABS
        'They gave me a big billycan like this'.
  Here, in context, the information focus appears to be on the deictic ""like this"", and
generally, on the size of the billycan, further expressed by the qualifier in final position.
In the following tone unit the billycan is further described, by an adjectival nominal set
off on its own tone, as ""clean"".
  In the next example, yidinen-bi 'whole' modifies the earlier occurring lege walanja
One goanna':(595) lege               walanja            nga-ga-ndi         go      yidinen-bi
      one-ABS            goanna-ABS         ISG-take-PST       3SG-DAT whole-ART
        Ί took one goanna for him whole'.
  In this context, the referent ""goanna"" appears to be considered recoverable, and was
explicitly mentioned in the previous tone group. What seems to be presented as salient
is that, on one occasion, the speaker took back a whole goanna for her father.(596) ma-garlarl             0-we-ndi-ya              ma-nyeyn
      MA-clean-ABS           3SG-fall-PST-NAR         MA-body-ABS
        'The vegetable matter fell down clean'/ 'the clean vegetable matter fell down'.
 In context, a contrast is being made between the ""body"" which falls away clean after
winnowing, and the skin (mentioned in first position in the following tone unit) which
242 Chapter 10must be put to one side. The focus appears to be on ""flesh"" and ultimately the contrast
between ""flesh"" and ""skin"".(597) ma-jad             wurr-nwrnbu-rri-ya           mayin              yanima-n
      MA-big-ABS         3NSG-make-PST-NAR            food-ABS           thus-ABS
        'They made a big loaf of it like this'.
  In context, the speaker has referred to vegetable paste from which she says a big loaf
(mayin)' like this' is made. The focus of information appears to be on the nature and size
of the loaf, and perhaps particularly on the deictic ""like this"".(598) wwren              0-dagbarla-rri      wudu
      child-ABS          3SG-have-PST        little-ABS
        'She had a little child'.
  This tone unit occurs early in a narration (Gawalyan 2) in which very little is
presupposed; only gawalyan 'porcupine' has been mentioned as protagonist in the
preceding tone unit.
  Questions arise about the textual significance of such preferred constructions, and
possible constituent analysis of them. It would seem that the earlier-occurring lexemes
are part of what each tone group as a whole ""is about"", or constitute part of the theme,
in that sense, of each. However, those lexemes in first position generally seem, in context,
to be less a focus of the information unit as a whole than other later-occurring elements
with which they are cohesive. As the above examples suggest, the nominal prefix system
of Wardaman may play a particular role in making explicit the link between such
discontinous elements. In general terms, my hypothesis is that this is a kind of
discontinuity which breaks up a larger theme into parts, the earlier (at least in general, if
not in every case) through this presentation rendered as more fully presupposed, the later
as more in-focus for one reason or another e.g., because it is contrastive, or otherwise the
less presupposable element of the theme as a whole.
  Are such constructions to be analyzed as one phrase or two? All of those illustrated
occur on a single tone unit, and we have hypothesized above that the discontinuity plays
a role in distributing information over that unit, representing an intersection of Theme
with Given/New contrasts. Partly because these constructions occur on a single tone
unit, I provisionally regard each one as a single noun phrase, and the discontinuity as as
a way in which more highly presupposable (but not completely given and ellipsable)
nominal reference is carried through the text. The common reference of both parts
reinforces the identification of participants, but distribution of information into two parts
allows one to be presented as more highly presupposed than the other, and (generally)
less highly contrastive with surrounding nominal expressions. Where information is
distributed discontinuously in this way, first position appears to be more strongly
associated with more highly presupposed thematic elements, final position with those
that are less so.

"12.2.5. Negative particles wonggo and warnaThere are two negative particles wonggo and warna, which do not appear to differ in
possibilities of syntactic distribution, but do differ in relative frequency. Of the two,
wonggo is the most common in the speech of all from whom lengthy texts have been
collected, with the exception of one person whose texts tend either to have approximately
equal numbers of these particles, or a slight preponderance of warna. However, since
this person was a minor contributor to the text collection overall, it is difficult to know
what to make of his case. People from whom the greatest amounts of material were
collected, including notably Elsie Raymond, her father, and Lily Gin.gina, used both
particles, but showed a disproportion ranging as high as ten to one in any given text in
favour of wonggo, but in some texts (those with the lowest number of negated clauses)
occurring in equal proportions.
   Both are clausal negators, and generally occur immediately preceding a finite verb, or
before particle plus finite verb combination, or sometimes in between particle and finite
verb (see below). Both may negate verbless predications, i.e. those in which the
predicative constituent is a nominal (including pronoun), and the 'missing verb' to be
understood as a copular one of being. Negations of existence of something in a place
are generally made with -wagbawun suffixed to a nominal (5.3.2.). Although warna is
overall less frequent and both negators may occur in all possible syntactic contexts, there
nevertheless appears to be a slight preference for warna to be more frequent in verbless
(zero copula) construction type rather than as negator of overt, finite predications,
compared to the frequencies of wonggo in these two different contexts. This suggests
there may formerly have been a clearer distributional difference between them, but if so,
it has been eroded.
   Both particles may occur with the range of tense-aspect-mood forms, i.e., with present,
past, ordinary future, and potential. Because of the particular meaning of the
'admonitive' category, designating an as-yet unrealized situation as unwelcome (e.g.,
""lest he get sick""), the negative particles are not found, or at least have not been found
in material collected, in that construction type.
   As discussed in 8.9.2., functional negative imperatives are not distinct from negated,
irrealis present forms of the verb, thus irrealis yi-ni-marn-bu-n 'you (SG) may make it'
and negative imperative wonggo yi-ni-marn-bu-n 'you ought not/cannot make it', also
functionally an imperative ""do not make it!"". A basic distinction exists between negative
predications which negate a predicate of indicative mood, versus those which negate a
predicate of irrealis mood. For the present tense, the difference may be illustrated by the
contrast between wonggo (or warna) nganja Ί am not going', the negative of the
indicative form nganja Ί am going' (this instant, or imminently), versus wonggoAvama
yi-nganja Ί may not/cannot/ought not go'. All of the glossed non-indicative modalities
are expressed formally with the irrealis markers (i.e., first position prefix/es and
appropriate pronominal adjuncts (see 6.7.3.).
                                               Clausal particles, conjunctions and interjections 301  The same contrast may exist in the past, between negated indicative forms (""did not
X"") and irrealis (""would/could not have""). Thus, wonggo and wama are simply negators,
while modality is signalled by the (indicative or irrealis) form of the predicate. Examples
of the negative particles — first wonggo, then wama — follow with commentary.(744) yinyang           wonggo              yi-marnany-garang

'no, nothing, none', which is often used as complement to predications of negative

302 Chapter 12  Note that the formulation of the meaning of (749) is not by means of the negation of
an indicative predication, but rather by use of an irrealis verb form which signals
incapacity and/or habit of not doing something, and is thus more than the simple negation
of an indicative assertion ""she is making fire"" etc.(750) wonggo            ngawun-wo-ndi

  In (754), the second occurrence of wonggo negates the predication ""I am your wife"",
with zero copula of being. In such a construction, the independent pronoun cannot be
seen as contrastive, for it is the only means by which person-number can be expressed
in the absence of a finite verb.(755)   wonggo ngayugu          nganu-gomarla-n               yibiwi

10.6. The negated noun phraseOne of the most commonly heard words in Wardaman is ngawun 'nothing, none'. One
man of my acquaintance was in fact called by the nickname ""Ngawun"", because
whenever anybody asked him for anything they could be sure of his answer. However,
ngawun is an interjection. The particle which most commonly negates the noun or noun
phrase is wonggo, or secondarily warna. These always precede that which they negate
(see 12.2.5.).(590) wonggo             lege              miwinin

"7.6.7. Secondary adverbsA few common adverbs are worthy of mention as ""secondary"", that is derived from
basically adverbial forms by means of nominal case-suffixes. The processes involved
are not regular, but examples include: gurru-ya 'later', built from the adverbgiirru of
the same meaning by addition of the Locative case suffix; niarla-warr Over and over,
again', built from what is elsewhere (8.13.) an iterative verbal suffix by means of the
Allative case-suffix; andyijarlu-warr 'sometimes', built from the adjectival nominal
stemyijarlu 'some', again with the Allative suffix.

  Categories of the finite verb, and the verb in the clause
8.1. Introduction: Verbal construction typesThere are two common types of verbal construction in Wardaman. One has as its main
constituent a finite verb which by itself expresses the lexical verbal content of the clause.
It carries pronominal adjuncts in keeping with the transitivity structure of the clause
which the verb partly instantiates, and marking for a number of verbal categories
including tense-mood-aspect, and possibly others such as subordination. Finite verbs
may be divided into a number of different formal types, based on shape and analyzability
(see following).
  The second kind of construction is one which consists of a verb particle and inflecting
verb. The verb particle, an interesting, multi-functional part of speech, is the basis of
formation of a number of types of adclausal complements (see 11.4.). But for the moment
we will consider it only as part of the verbal construction. In such particle+ finite verb
structures, often most of the lexical verbal content of the clause is associated with the
particle, while the lexical contribution of the finite verb may vary. We might think of the
possible internal relation of particle and finite verb as a spectrum, with variation along
it in terms of the semantic specificity versus generality of the verb. Where the verb is
highly general, it may seemingly contribute only to specification of the transitivity of the
clause, but very little to lexical meaning. Where the verb is semantically more specific
and transparent in combination with the particle, it contributes both to the specification
of transitivity in the clause, and to lexical meaning in a more readily analyzable way.
  Most particles tend to be fairly specialized in their co-occurrence, that is, they occur
with only one or a small number of inflecting verbs. But combinations tend to differ in
the extent to which the meaning contributions of particle and verb can be assessed. An
example is birdij, which in material recorded has been found with only two inflecting
verbs. Its combination with the CV- root gi-, yields the meaning 'find, locate'. In
construction with the CV- root na-, it means 'to espy, to find' (as, in the terms of
Australian Aboriginal child-spirit concepts, a father or other relative is said to ""find"" a
child, see Merlan 1986). Such examples present themselves more or less as idioms with
respect to given meanings, in that the contribution to meaning cannot be neatly
apportioned as between particle and finite verb. But such combinations have some
degree of semantic transparency that can be assessed by looking at the meaning the finite
verb may have as sole constituent of a verb phrase, and by comparing the various pairings
of the particle with other finite verbs.
  Most of the finite verbs that occur in such combinations as birdij gi- can occur by
themselves as the main constituent in verbal constructions of the first type discussed
above; and from their occurrence there, an independent lexical meaning can be
established. By itself, the verb gi- means 'to put'; and na- 'to see'. We can therefore
172 Chapters appreciate that with respect to the combination birdij gi-, the second combination birdij
 na- may be analyzed as 'finding by seeing', or the like. But there seems to be no revealing
 way to further analyze the relationship between birdij and gi- in semantic terms.
    In other cases of limited co-occurrence of particle with finite verbs, we may speak more
 confidently of the semantic contribution and relation to each other of the constituents.
 For instance, the particle gayardung 'run' may occur with verbs of motion ya- 'go' and
 nyanga- 'come', but we are able to say that the particle expresses a manner of movement,
 while the finite verbs differ in directionality.
    It is not usual for a particle to commonly occur with more than several different finite
 verbs. An important grammatical feature that such alternative combinations may
 contribute to, or directly instantiate, is transitivity at the clause level. For example, the
 particle birriwirlib 'roll, tumble' with either main motion verb, 'go' or 'come' may only
 occur as part of an intransitive clause structure. However, with either wudba- (which by
 itself means 'to throw') or bu-, the combination can only occur within a transitive clause
 structure (with appropriate pronominal adjuncts, etc.). There are many ways in
Wardaman that such intransitive/transitive pairs or sets with the same verb particle are
 implemented, and sometimes here an (at least partial) semantic compatibility between
particle and co-occurring finite verb can be discerned by examining the set of possible
pairings into which each particle may enter (as above, the two pairings with birdij). For
instance, two common combinations into which the particle bard enters are: bard wudba-
 'throw down', and bard we- 'fall down'. From this can be discerned some of the
semantic components associated with bard rather than with the finite verb, i.e., trajectory
downwards. In another example, we find the combinations barlarra gi- 'to hide', and
barlarrajingi- 'to hide, be in hiding', where the lexical semantics of the finite verbs ('to
put' and 'to be, sit' respectively) are expanded into the difference between transitive and
intransitive clause structures. Compare the different possibilities of pairing with bod-ba
 'visit': with na- 'see', it means 'to visit'; with nyanga- (otherwise 'to come') the pair
means 'come to visit', and with lawu- (otherwise 'to reach, get to, catch up to, fetch'),
something like 'visit with'.
   There are many instances where alternative pairing does not change transitivity value,
but rather subtly alters verbal semantics. The particle birrij-ba with bu- (by itself, 'hit,
strike') means 'to knead'; but with me- (otherwise, 'to get') means 'to stir'. Both finite
verbs determine transitive clause-level structures. Similarly, bag-ba with ya- (by itself
 'to go') may be translated simply 'to break'; but with we- (ordinarily, 'to fall') may be
translated 'fall and break, break in falling'. Both of the finite verbs here instantiate
intransitive clause structures.
   So far most of the examples have involved pairings in which the particle appears more
specialized than the finite verb in its lexical semantics. We may say this on the basis that
verbs like gi- and bu- occur in combination with many different particles, and in many
instances the semantic contribution of the verb amounts to little more than the
specification of general type of action, or minimally, determination of the transitivity of
the clause. There are, however, pairings with what might be described as semantically
more specific lexical verbs, which co-occurring particles seemingly further qualify. Here
the verbs contribute not only transitivity, but a more specialized lexical meaning. An
                                                                   Categories of the finite verb 173
example in point in the verb bewe- 'to step on, tread upon', which has been found paired
with particles bengmarla in the meaning 'to snap, break', and gilywaj in the meaning 'to
trample'. See 8.19. for more detailed examination of causativization and other transitive/
intransitive pairings.
  Insofar as a finite verb appears to only specify transitivity and contribute little to
predicate semantics, it is convenient to consider it an ""Auxiliary"" verb. In interlinear
glosses, many finite verbs in particular constructions are so labelled. However, as we
have seen, there is a variable degree to which finite verbs in particle* verb constructions
may be defined as having only an auxiliary function. Partly by examining alternative
pairings with the same particle, additional degrees of predicate function and semantic
contribution can be discerned.
  It can also be seen that particles function to specify verbal semantics. The more fully
they do so, the more limited they are in their possible pairings with finite verbs. The
more generalized they are semantically, the greater are their possibilities of co-occurrence
with a variety of lexical verbs. There is a point at which we want to call the more general
modifiers ""adverbs"", and as has already been indicated at several places in this
description, there is no absolute line that can be drawn in Wardaman between verb
particles and adverbs — both, for example, can form adclausal complements, but the
latter are more limited in this respect. It is, however, useful to recognize a general
difference between the two word-classes in the terms given.
  Finite verbs fall into several different formal classes. There is a small but very
important set of 15 or 16 CV roots (see 8.16.), all of these are of high frequency both as
independent verbs, and most also as auxiliaries or supporting predicates in particle+ verb
constructions. These are ba- 'burn, thirst', bu- 'hit', ga- 'take', gi- 'put', la- 'bite', lu-
'cry', me- 'get', na 'see', ni- 'bring', nge- 'sing', ngu- 'eat, consume', we- 'fall', wo-
'give', να- 'go', yo- 'spear', and yu-, copula (see 8.20.). The verb ""go"" is so irregular
that it is not particularly useful to classify it as a CV- root, hence the alternative 15 or 16.
  There are finite verbs of two syllables which are morphologically unanalyzable, or
monomorphemic. Examples are bewe- 'tread on', buju- 'to dig', gaju- 'to rise, grow',
gerle- 'to taste', gerne- 'to take away from'; gewu- 'to shoo, chase away', gila- 'to water,
douse', ginye- 'to cook'Jingi- to sit', linyje- 'to cut', megbe- 'to snap' golo- 'to laugh
at', menyje- 'to feel', mowo- 'to steal', ngenyje- 'to choke', nyanga- 'to come', waja-
'to leave', yana- 'to do, say', yeli- 'to call out', and yonga- 'to farewell'. Some of these
show a suggestively similar final syllable, e.g., the final -(ny)je- in linyje- 'cut', menyje -
'feel', and ngenyje- 'choke', indicating that this may be historically analyzable.
  Some verbs of two syllables, and all of three syllables or more, are morphologically
analyzable into two parts, a variable initial element and a small set of inseparable, final
auxiliary-like elements. These include the pairs -ma and -ba which are in complementary
distribution depending on the stem-final element; -wu and -bu, also in complementary
distribution; a small number of verbs with final element -ma, suggesting that this also
may be historically separable; a small number of verbs with final syllable -rla some of
which contrast with verbs which lack this element, and on the basis of which the final
syllable may be seen as a transitivizing element; and a few verbs which contain a final
syllable ->·/- (post-nasal -ji-), identical with what is elsewhere the reflexive-reciprocal
174 Chaptersmarker, but which here must be defined as a formal marker of a small class of
mediopassive verbs.
  Where the syllable -ma occurs, the initial element may be analyzed as ending in any
segment but a stop; the shape -ba follows stops. Examples are: giirrg-ba- 'sleep',
gayg-ba-' shout', barlirrg-ba-' sweep', bidbid-ba-' twirl firedrill', borlorrod-ba-' spread
o\A\jongorog-ba- 'yawn' Jornog-ba- 'fill up', lorrod-ba- 'sharpen', mowoj-ba- 'sneak
away', wud-ba- 'throw'; yerrb-(b)a- 'be ashamed', yid-ba- 'sharpen', andyurrg-ba-
'feel'. Examples with final -ma- axe:jong-ma-' kiss' Jorl-nia-' kick', nmrndi-nia-' mind,
look after', newerr-tna- 'be hungry', nginy-nta- 'help', ngorr-nia- 'grind', ngunyang-
ma- 'knead', warrang-nia- 'swear', warrgany-ma- 'mess up', born-nia- 'bathe, wash',
and others. This final syllable, -ba or -nia, is probably to be seen as historically relatable
to the final particle suffix of the same allomorphy (11.1.2.). Such a relationship is
supported by the fact that there are some forms with this final syllable which are inflecting
verbs, or alternatively may function as verb particles, e.g., finite ngorlog-ba-, and particle
ngorlogba; or inflecting born-nia-, and particle bornborn 'bathe'.
  The shape-ΗΊί occurs after non-nasal sonorants, while -bu occurs after stops and nasals.
Examples of each are: bel-wii- 'slice', jewu- 'show', lawn- 'get, fetch, reach'; versus
lid-bu- 'sew', /wr/z-im- 'make^yerrenggej-bii- 'rummage, make a mess of, jarram-bu-
'look iar'Jinjin-bu- 'give work to, lay tasks upon', dem-bu- 'peck at'. Historically, this
final element is probably to be related to the finite independent verb bu-, but cannot be
synchronically identified with it, as their past tense suffixes differ (e.g., bel-wu-rri 'he
sliced it' versus bu-ndi' he hit it').
  The few verbs which end suggestively, for the purposes of historical analysis, in -rna
are: jomarna- 'to finish off, ledbarna- 'see', and wojbarna- 'listen'. This may be
relatable to na- 'see'.
  The verbs which end in -rla, some of which also contrast with stems which lack the
final syllable, are the following:
gayg-ba-        'call out'(intransitive) vs.       gayg-ba-rla-     'call out to'
biyima-rla-     'inflate' (transitive)
dagba-rla-      'have' (transitive)
wema-rla-       'vomit' (something) vs.            wentiyi-         'vomit'
  The small class of verbs called semantically ""Mediopassive"", and which are
constructionally intransitive, includes a number which do not contrast with a paired
transitive verb, but a small number that do, however, as follows.
jawe-yi-        'be tired'
lo-yi-          ' dance'
jerri-yi-        'be cold'
la-yi-           'die'
garrany-jiyi-   'grow'
worlgbi-yi-     'work for, do work for'vs.         worlg-ba-        'roil'
burla-yi-        'lie, tell lies, be a liar' vs.   burla-ma-        'lie to'
wali-yi-        'be jealous of               vs.   wali-na-         'be jealous towards'
wenuyi-         'vomit'                   vs.      weniarla-        'vomit' (something)
                                                                 Categories of the finite verb 175  This element must evidently be seen historically as related to the reflexive-reciprocal
marker, which intransitivizes the predicate where subject and object are co-referential or
overlap, to create a formally intransitive clause. The segmentation of the form ""to grow""
is tentative, for it appears that there has been doubling of the mediopassive element.
  A final, isolated final syllable is equivalent to the CV verb ""to consume"", and occurs
ingun-ngu- 'drown'.","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]"
"8.15. Subordinate suffixationThere is a generalized subordinate clause type in Wardaman which fills both
""NP-relative"" and ""T(emporal)-relative"" functions (see Hale 1976 for discussion of this
generalized clause type in a number of Australian languages). Unlike a number of
languages of this region which have only this one generalized subordinate clause type
(see e.g., Merlan 1982 and 1983: 135; Heath 1981), Wardaman also has a range of other
kinds of adclausal constructions (Chapter 11).
  In Wardaman, subordination of one clause to another is signalled by means of two
suffixes. One, -n-ga, has non-past temporal reference and expresses imperfectivity of
the predicate to which it is suffixed in relation to the predicate of the linked clause; while
the other, -ny-ga expresses past temporal reference and perfectivity with respect to the
predicate of the linked clause. The suffixes are obviously bimorphemic and may be
analyzed as having a tense-marking element, followed by a common subordinate marker.
Each is suffixed to predicates which are otherwise no different from their normal form.(455)   marluga            gagung             berru

  In (455), the first prosodic line names and identifies Berru; the second further describes
him by means of a past subordinate construction of which he is subject; the third continues
the earlier story-line concerning Berru's being sent on an errand. Note that the phrase
""old man grandfather Berru"" is Absolutive, in keeping with its function as direct object
of the predicate ""send"", rather than Ergative as it would normally be were the predicate
""have"" in a main rather than subordinate clause.(456)   ngan-ga-ndi                0-na-rri            tnagulu           dibid-ba

 The past subordinate clauses in (456) and (457) are both ad-nominal, the first modifying
magulu, the second, marluga.(458)   ngan-werreny-bu-rri         yarrirndi-yi     barrangardba            wu-warringun

that is, one in which the subordinate clause is not ad-nominal, but rather modifies an
entire other clause, supplying some kind of background information.(459) barlba-wan        jarrambu 0-yanggi        barlb    yayi-we-ny-ga

looking around for where it might situate itself in the landscape; note the past subordinate

  (461) is adnominal modifier of yijeng 'foot', the object of the main first and third
clauses. All examples so far have been of past subordinate forms, but present ones are
equally common:(462)    ngarl yawu-da-n           ngamanda-warda yilama yibiyan    yilama

        'Whatever are they barking at? maybe a man, maybe a cow, coming down to

  In (462) the clause ""corning to water"" contains present subordinate verb which modifies
each of the suggested possibilities. Mention of the dogs' barking is taken up again in a
further linked clause, marked with the important textual linking suffix -wan (see
12.3.7.).
  A subordinate verb-form may be further suffixed with the adverbial specifier of place
-beng ~ -weng, to create a modifying clause of ""place where"":(463)   0-waja-rri          waj     jumba      julu-ya          baraj          nana

 The adverbial ending may also be suffixed to a nominal head, and a subordinate clause
modify it:(464)   nga-gurrgba-yan yimiyan-beng           nga-da-ny-ga             yi-guwarlangana

 Alternatively, a clause (as in 463) may be subordinate to a nominal head of location,
with a subordinate clause suffixed with -beng modifying it:(465) nga-nyanga-n                nan-ba   megerrman         ngarr-buju-ny-ga-weng

  In elicitation, informants produced examples with both Allative and Locative inflection
of subordinate clauses, for example:
                                                                Categories of the finite verb 197(466)   gangman            ngo-yo-ny-ga-warr     nan-garr                 nganjigbe

  There are clauses within certain kinds of constructions, and particular verbal categories,
which generally may be seen as providing kinds of background information to main
clauses, and it is common in Wardaman (but not obligatory) for such clauses to exhibit
subordinate marking. The first construction of this kind which deserves mention is the
conditional one (past and present). The protasis, or ""if — clause, generally introduced
by or containing the particle bujun (see 12.2.2.), may be seen as providing background
information in the sense that it specifies the conditions under which that which is
designated by the apodosis will obtain. The protasis is often formally a subordinate
clause, as the following examples show:(468) bujun yi-ngan-yana-ny-ga           yiwama                           wiyan
      if       IRR-3SG/lSG-teIl-PST-SUB  other-ABS                        rain-ABS
      yiyalang      yi-ngang-mam-bu-rri
      inform         IRR-1SG/2SG-AUX-PST
        'Had he told me last wet season I would have told you'.
  The predicate of the protasis, ""had he told me"", is formally subordinate, indicating its
linkage, as condition, to the formally independent apodosis which specifies what the
outcome would have been. Another example of this kind is:(469) bujun      yi-ngon-wo-ny-ga         ma-jad     yi-ngong-wo-ndi
       if        IRR-3SG/lSG-give-PST-SUB MA-big-ABS IRR-lSG/2SG-give-PST
        'If he had given me a lot, I would have given you [some]'.
  The Habitual verbal category (8.10.), in keeping with its categorial semantics, may be
used to specify background information in relation to linked clauses with independent
predicates, and in this capacity often is formally subordinate to them, as the following
examples illustrate:(470)   warramarlg-ba ma-nu-\vudba             nganu       dubuluj
        overturn-PS    HAB-2NSG-AUX-PRES ISO-DAT           bag-ABS

        'You're always overturning my bag, what for? [as] you always search around
         maybe for money'.
198 Chapters  The Habitual, present subordinate-marked ""you always search(ing) around"" specifies
the general conditions under which the overturning occurs.(471) yi-gerrngmarnan   ngalyalya ma-yi-jmgi-n-ga                       mayi-wu

      nes            HAB-2NSG-cook-PRES 3SG-DAT
        'He's a crybaby always crying for food, you don't cook for him all the time'.
  As in (471), the semantic subordinate linkage between two such clauses may be rather
weak, and even were the predicate of the first clause to be independent in form, the logical
linkage between the two clauses would be fairly obvious.(472) nga-wojbarna-n       ma-nganjaga                          dan-gar r

        Ί listen, I might go there, they [are] always talking to me'.
  Subordination of ""they sitting (talking)"" in (472) perhaps makes slightly more explicit
the reason for the subject's going where ""they"" are, that is, implies a logical linkage
between the two clauses.
  The Habitual category has only been recorded to occur with the non-past subordinate
marker, in keeping with the fact that it has not been found to be inflected for past tense.","[218, 219, 220, 221, 222]"
"8.2. Overview of tense-aspect-mood categoriesA main contrast within the system of verbal categories is that between Indicative and
Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms. Indicative forms are those in which there is no explicit
qualification of the reality or eventuality of that which is designated by the predicate;
Irrealis forms are those which are overtly so qualified. The distinction must be seen as
one which is tailored to the linguistic categories, however, for not all Indicative forms
designate ""real"" events. They are used rather to make predicate meanings in a way that
involves no explicit qualification of the factuality or eventuality of what the predicate
designates.
  The Indicative categories are Present, Past, Future and Potential, each of which is
described and illustrated in a separate section below. Each category is marked by one or
more allomorphs, and the tense-mood-aspect categories in the language overall are highly
regular and show little variation. The Present, Future and Potential forms have non-past
ya- in first position within the inflecting verb in 'third person' forms, i.e., in those where
the sole pronominal adjunct is third person, and in those in which both subject and object
are third persons (see 6.6.). This initial non-past, third person prefix in the non-past
categories contrasts with zero in the same position in the Past forms of the verb, e.g.,
yanggun-bu-n 'he is hitting them', versus wunggun-bu-ndi 'he hit them'.
  As a whole, the Indicative mood contrasts with Irrealis mood. Irrealis is directly
signalled by first-position prefix(es) in the verb, in general yayi- for 'third person' forms
(as above), and yi- for non-third person forms. There are also some differences from
Indicative forms in person-marking pronominals (6.6.3. for further details). Irrealis
prefixation may co-occur both with Present and Past tense marking, and further, with a
zero-stem form, i.e., one with no explicit tense-aspect suffixation. Irrealis prefixation
with Present forms of the verb expresses modal meanings of the sort ""ought to"", and with
negative particles (either wonggo or warna, 12.2.5.), meanings 'should not', and 'cannot'
(either inability or physical and/or social constraint). Negative Imperatives in Wardaman
(8.9.2.) are not formally distinguished from such forms. Irrealis prefixation with Past
tense marking expresses past counterfactual meanings ""meant to"", ""ought to have"", and
the like. Irrealis prefixation with zero-stem expresses mere possibility ""may, might"" (and
contrasts with Potential, which expresses eventuality but without qualification of the
reality of the event designated by the predicate). A particular use of the Irrealis zero-stem
forms is in what may be called ""admonitive"" constructions, often best translated by use
of English ""lest"". There will be some illustration in this chapter of all of these forms and
uses, and forward reference to discussion of conditional and other constructions in
following chapters.
176 Chapter 8  Most verbs in Wardaman have an invariable stem to which inflectional endings are
added. Some, however, show a distinctive Future stem form, that is, a stem to which
Future suffix is added. For those verbs which have distinctive Future stem, this is also
found in Irrealis zero-suffix forms, i.e. with Irrealis prefixation and zero suffixation to
the stem, to express mere possibility, and also in the admonitive semantic construction
type mentioned above.
  The verbs which have distinctive Future stem are all ones with final stem-vowel a: all
those verbs with final syllable -ma ~ -ba, as well asyana- 'say, do', nyanga- 'come', and
the irregular ya- 'go'. (Not all stems with final a, however, have a distinctive Future
stem; for example, la- 'to bite', ga- 'to take', ba- 'to burn', do not). To exemplify the
relation between the regular and Future stem, and the Irrealis form with zero suffix, we
can take the verb nyanga-: Present 3SG form ya-0-nyanga-n, PUT ya-0-nyangi-we, and
zero-suffixed Irrealis form yayi-0-nyangi 'lest he come'. The vowel of the regular stem
is a, that of the Future stem, i (following which the Future suffix -wa becomes -we). In
this sharing of stem by Future and (one of the) Irrealis paradigmatic forms, we see some
indication of the historical nature of the Future as a sub-category of Irrealis mood. From
this we may assume that the generalization of the -wa as Future suffix is a later
development in the language, and that stem alternation is a relic of an earlier, somewhat
different organization of tense-mood categories.
  The Positive Imperative (8.7.) is neither Indicative nor Irrealis. ""Hortative"" (8.8.)
constitutes a semantic category of forms of urging (""let us go"", ""may he go"" etc.), but
the first-position prefix complex is distinctive only in third person forms. Otherwise, the
prefix complex is not distinguished from that found in Indicative forms.
  There is an Habitual verbal category (8.10.), which has been found to occur only with
Present-tense suffixation on the verb, and may also have additionally non-past
subordinate suffixation. As noted in 6.6.4., formally the Habitual prefix complex has
much in common with the Irrealis mood category, but there is no reason to see Habitual
synchronically as a sub-category of Irrealis. Final sections of this chapter describe
reflexive-reciprocal marking, minor aspectual categories of the verb (marked by outer
suffixes), and subordinate marking. There is also a discussion of the paradigm of the
highly irregular verb ""to go"".","[199, 200]"
"12.3.5. Wunyjug 'because'There is a sole, explicitly ""causal"" conjunction which expresses ""because, for the reason
that"". This appears in the data in two forms, as wuwunyjug and as wunyjug, from which
one may suppose that the initial wu- is etymologically relatable to the noun class prefix
of the same shape, and perhaps is to be understood as ""because of wu- class thing"", one
of the possible fields of denotation being madin 'word', or 'language' generally. In other
words, it may be that the form wu-wunyjug is to be understood as anaphoric to a
constituent or stretch of text, indexing it as ""cause"". This seems especially plausible in
that the few occurring types of instances of this particle were ones in which it was
preceded by nana functioning as a sort of resumptive pronoun, ""because ofthat"", where
""that"" could be read as a previous stretch of text.
312 Chapter 12  Interestingly, not a single instance of this particle showed up in collected texts. For this
search, 87 pages of computerized text, and a further 60 pages of handwritten, glossed and
analyzed text, were used as the searched corpus, the material ranging from life-history

this kind seem to be formulated in such a way that it generally has a nominal constituent

"3.7.3. Vowel assimilationThe processes in question are low-level assimilations of certain prefixal and suffixal
vowels to the quality of adjacent vowels in noun and verb stems. Assimilations affecting
prefixes are regressive from the first stem-vowel ""backwards"" to the prefix, those
affecting verb suffixes are progressive from the final stem-vowel ""forwards"" to the
suffixal vowel.
  Regressive assimilation from the verb stem applies to certain pronominal prefixes, all
and only those in which the sole vowel is a: 1SG nga-, 1INPL ngarr-, and third singular
nonpast conjugation marker (8.2.) ya-\ transitive combination 1SG        > 2SG ngang-,
and 3SG          > 1SG combination ngan-. Though it usually has the opportunity to apply
to only one vowel leftwards of the conditioning stem vowel, in the case of the habitual
mood prefix ma- followed by a person element in which the sole vowel is a (i.e., the 1SG
element nga-, it applies to both elements in sequence, ma-nga- (see 6.6.4.). It applies
(optionally, but usually) just where the adjacent stem vowel is a mid-vowel, ο or e. The
a of the prefix tends to assimilate to the quality of the mid- vowel. Thus, the relevant
forms of the verb wo 'give' usually (but in careful pronunciation do not necessarily)
become: from /nga-won/ Ί give it', ngowon; from /ngarr-won/ 'we INPL give it',
ngorrwon; from /ya-won/ 'he gives it', yowon; from/ngang-wo-n/ Ί give it to you SG.',
ngongwon; from /ngan-wo-n/ 'he gives it to me', ngonwon. Similarly, in a verb with
                                                                          Process phonology 41
front mid stem-vowel, we find such forms as: from /nga-we-n/ Ί fall' ngewen; from
/nga-rr-we-n/ 'we Incl fall' ngerrwen; from/ya-we-n/ 'he falls', yewen, and so on.
  There is a third person irrealis prefix combination yayi- (see 6.6.3.) in which a, being
minimally one vowel removed from the first stem-vowel (i.e., other person-number
elements may follow before the stem), does not assimilate.
  An example of a verb with more than one stem vowel is the following: /nga-gomarla-n/
 Ί follow him', generally realized as ngo-gomarlan. Where the prefix is bi- or multi-
syllabic, thus separating the α vowel from the stem, the assimilation does not occur:
/nga-rr-wu-n-gomarla-n/ 'we INPL follow them', ngarrun.gomarlan.
  The noun class prefix Imal also commonly shows the effects of regressive assimilation
before a stem with ""next-over"" mid-vowel. Because nouns show much less paradigmatic
variation than verbs — i.e., inflect with a lesser number of elements, and most noun stems
tend to occur with only one class prefix — some nouns quite invariably show this kind
of assimilation. The overall result has evidently been a tendency towards long-term
change, through vowel assimilation and fusion of the erstwhile prefix with the stem,
creating a lexical unit. Examples of this kind are: mogorlgorl Ampelocissus; mordon
'creeper', megerrman 'long yam'. In all these cases, initial mV must now be considered
part of the stem, but historically, is transparently the class prefix /ma/ which has vegetable
foods central among the nouns to which it is usually prefixed. The assimilatory process
is also synchronically active, as in me-dengdeng 'fig' (species), or me-dewoman
yi-mum-gu 'white of the eye, sclera', where /ma/ becomes me- before the mid-vowel.
The stem 'white' may be prefixed with the other noun class markers, in which instances
no assimilation occurs, e.g., wu-dewoman 'white', WU- class. Variation may be observed
in realization of ma- before stems with mid-vowel, e.g., both ma-jem and me-jern
'stomach', occur.
  My transcription practice (in the texts and examples) is to write the basic vowel of the
pronominal prefixes, e.g., invariably 1SG nga- no matter what its realization. However,
with the noun class prefix /ma/ the assimilation is indicated in the transcription, since
this does not seem to impede intelligibility or easy identification, given that a single
morpheme is involved. Where (as in megerrman 'long yam') the prefix has become
fused to the stem and there is no alternation of prefix, no morpheme boundary is indicated.
  Progressive assimilation affects the realization of the future tense suffix /wa/, the
directional suffix Man/ (sometimes, also, potential -ycm). These processes, however, are
not identical, and will be discussed in turn.
  Assimilation of the future suffixal vowel α occurs only to e, after a final stem-vowel e
or /; no change occurs where the final stem-vowel is o. Thus the realization of
/nga-we-wa/ Ί will fall' is ngewewe, where the stem mid-vowel determines assimilation
to it of both 1SG prefix and future suffix; also /nga-jingi-wa/ Ί will sit', ngajingiwe', but
ngongwowa Ί will give it to you', not ngongwowo.
  Often, the relevant stem-final vowel conditioning progressive assimilation is / of the
reflexive-reciprocal marker ->·/-. As already noted in 3.4.2. above, and further discussed
in 3.9. below, following this morpheme and before the future tense suffix is a nasal -ng-,
but this does not block the assimilation. Thus, /ya-wu-r-bu-yi-ng-wa/ 'they will fight' is
realized as yawurrbuyingbe.
42 Chapters  There is a small class of verbs, largely mediopassive in nature, which invariably have
-yi- as a stem formant, and these too, when suffixed with the future, always show the
same assimilation. Thus, /nga-jerri-yi-ng-wa/ Ί will be cold', with mediopassive stem
/jerri-yi/, realized as ngejerriyingbe; /ya-wu-rr-lo-yi-ng-wa/ 'they will dance', with
mediopassive stem /lo-yi/ 'dance', realized as yawuloyingbe. The a vowel of the potential
suffix -yan may be fronted and raised somewhat following final / or e stem-vowel.
  Assimilation in the directional suffix /Ian/ occurs where the adjacent vowel, i.e., the
immediately preceding stem vowel, is either ο or e. Compare:

     jongon          jongo-rlon               'east, eastwards'  This suffixal vowel remains unaffected by other than mid-vowels, viz. there is no
tendency towards assimilation in such forms as dami-rlan 'towards this way'. Also,
presence of stem-final nasal appears to block the assimilation, viz. gorrong-lan 'towards
the south', not gorrong-lon.
  The assimilatory tendencies described above are represented by the following
descriptions. The first shows assimilation of prefixal a, and must be understood to mean
that no other prefixal element intervenes between the prefix containing a and the first
stem vowel, which has been therefore termed ""adjacent""

  Regarding the variable degree of spread of such vowel harmonies within words, some
further observations can be made. Conditioning vowel qualities in most instances
discussed are mid-vowels, and these and sometimes l\l result in the phonetic presence of
mid-vowels in inflectional affixes. Despite this, there are no inflectional affixes which
must be analyzed as containing mid-vowels (but two quite distinct derivational ones, see
discussion of -gume ~ -wurne in 8.19., and of -ye- in 11.4.1.). There are, however,
                                                                           Process phonology 43numerous cases in which nominal class prefix /ma/ has recurrently been assimilated to
stem-vowel qualities, and become fused as part of the stem. We may conclude that a
long-term effect has been to admit mid-vowels as part of re-analysed lexical stems, and
not to radically alter the vocalic segmental inventory of inflectional (or derivational)
affixes.
  In keeping with this apparent long-term trend, it needs to be noted that assimilatory
processes are commonly observed to be synchronically active, affecting a vowels across
certain morpheme boundaries, and even within nominal, pronominal, and verbal roots
themselves. To some extent, the conditions under which this may occur are similar to
certain ones already described.
  For example, there are instances of α in the second syllable of a stem being raised to a
height approximating [ε] following an initial syllable containing the vowel /. Careful
pronunciation of the 2SG independent pronoun reveals /yinyang/ as the basic form, but
usual realization is [yinyeng]. Arguably, such assimilation has historically determined
the present form of the nounyi-jeng 'foot', and others similar to this. The word now used
for 'policeman', yinyigben, must be etymologically analyzed as containing a derivational
suffix which has the allomorphs -ban and -man (see 9.3.); yet it is probably best to regard
the synchronic shape of the word as given above, with final mid-vowel which has
undergone historical assimilation following /.
  There are also instances of leftward moving spread of harmony over two vocalic nuclei,
where a certain amount of synchronic variability in the realization of the one second-to-
left suggests recent, even on-going, change; but where assimilation in left-most affixal
a (where this is relevant) indicates that the basic second-to-left vowel quality should now
probably be recognized as a mid-vowel. Examples will clarify the point.
  The verb ""to know"", has variable realizations of the following kinds (example is with
 1SG pronominal nga-, an assimilating vowel): [ngayarcten], [ngayerden], [ngeyzrden].
The fact that there is this much variability shows the process is not entirely settled. But
also, the fact that the α affixal vowel can, and generally does, show assimilation suggests
that the representation of the root, if only one, should now be /yerde/.
  Slightly differently, in the allative-marked directional 'downriver', we usually
encounter [bey£-rl&i], but also find something approaching [bayz-rlen], suggesting that
while the final root vowel is certainly e (to account for the suffixal assimilation), the first
may historically have been a, which has undergone and is still undergoing leftward-
moving harmony. This form is given as /beye/ (e.g., in the dictionary).
  However, some similar assimilations appear to have a certain synchronic lexical
specificity, in that other, apparently structurally similar forms show no tendency towards
variation in vowel qualities. In one particularly common instance, that of the word
/marnden/ 'ghost, white person', stressed a is often raised to approximate mid-level
before the following front mid-vowel, i.e., regressively. Thus this word is commonly
realized in two ways, as ['marnden], and as [ 'mernden]. There is no tendency for this to
occur where the following vowel is other than a mid-vowel, e.g., in /madin/ 'word,
language', which is invariably realized as ['madln\: the effect of/i/ on /a/ seems to be
only progressive from stem- to suffixal vowel. Nor is there any tendency for change in
quality to occur in other words apparently more similar to /marnden/, e.g., /ganben/
44 Chapters 'flying fox'. There may be a vowel-raising effect conditioned by presence of the retroflex
homorganic nasal-stop cluster. Given the more nearly equal frequency of occurrence of
the alternative forms of ""ghost, white person"" (compared, say, to frequencies of the stem-
forms for ""downriver"", of which beye is by far more common), it seems the variability
here should not be regularized at this stage, and both forms deserve separate dictionary
entry.
   Though regressive assimilation cannot be seen as the historical source of all mid-
vowels, nevertheless it is arguable that it has been historically important in yielding a
considerable number of bi- and poly-syllabic words, the vowels of which in the
contemporary language are all of the same quality, e.g.,: /gorromogon/ 'morning',
/jongon/ 'east', /ngorrogorro/ 'afternoon', /woyolong/ 'whipsnake', /borndoyorron/
Pandanus spiralis, /gornorrong/ 'long necked turtle', /menngen/ 'white cockatoo',
/ngeleleg/ 'little corella', /lerrwewen/ Ficus opposita, /jembe/ 'death adder', /geremerr/
'headband', and others. It must, however, also be noted that mid-vowels occur in words
with another mid-vowel of a different quality (/bedbog/ 'honeyeater', though one must
of course recognize that bird and some other animal names are commonly imitative, but
also /belgogban/ 'dry ground'), and with the vowels /a/, III and /u/, e.g., /ganben/ 'flying
fox' already cited, in which there is no tendency towards modification of the first vowel.
The point is simply that there is no indication one may identify in such assimilatory spread
as has been described here the historical origin of mid-vowels in this and related
languages. In fact, as we have seen, the process tends to spread mid-vowel qualities
outwards from lexical roots to affixes. Aspects of the contemporary lexical distribution
of mid-vowels, however, are clearly to be seen in the light of this spread. A few figures
may help to indicate the possible extent ofthat influence.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"
"11.1.1. Particle shapesThe particle suffix of shape -ba ~ -ma may be freely suffixed to the majority of particles,
and also to many of what are considered in this description to be ""adverbs"", that is, verbal
modifiers of a more general sort which may occur with a large number of predicates. As
noted in Chapter 4, particles constitute an open word class that cannot be strictly
delimited from adverbs, though it is useful to retain a distinction between them. There
are some particles which appear to contain what is historically the particle suffix, but
which now do not occur without it. For example duba 'sit' was probably dub-ba, and
with degemination normally occurred as duba. The suffix-less form dub, however, is not
used, in contradistinction to most particles of this shape which still have suffixed and
suffix-less alternative forms (e.g.Juba 'be deaf, shut, blocked', and alsojub). There is
also a large number of particles (such as the high-frequency ngorlog-ba 'talk') which
characteristically occur with the particle suffix, and although informants consider them
acceptable as particles without the suffix, elicitation and text material fails to reveal any
spontaneously-produced examples in which they lack the suffix. We may conclude that
there is a long-term tendency for the particle suffix to become lexicalized, and that this
may be especially likely where the particle is paralleled by finite verb of the same shape
(ngorlog-ba-, see comments below in on the historical relationship between particles
and finite verbs).
  Excluding those forms which are considered adverbs, i.e., general predicate modifiers
which may occur with a wide range of finite verbs, an examination was made of 460
particles to ascertain their shapes. Of these, 449 were finally tallied (the remaining few
were eliminated for various reasons, e.g., lowaglowa 'play' because of the exceptionality
of the gl cluster, jangjajang 'slurp' because of the apparently special nature of the
reduplicative process, etc.). Many fully reduplicative stems were classified as of the kind
of one of their identifiable segments, e.g., dingding(ma) 'be pretty, attractive, look nice'
was classified as if it were ding, i.e., as a CVS particle; wardagwardag 'shake head no',
as if it were wardag, i.e., as a CVC(C)VC particle. The final 449 fell into categories of
the following shapes in the numbers given (illustrative examples are also given):
                                                                Number              %     CVS where S = sonorant, e.g., jin 'blame'                    78              17.37

      CVC(C)VR/LG, e.g., birilg 'flatten'                            19                 4.23
      CVCCVCV(C)/(N/L), e.g., bulmarrab 'float'                      12                 2.67
      CVCVCCVC, e.g., yarramburl 'have gooseflesh'                    6                  .13
      CVCCV, e.g., don.go 'in a line, lined up'                       8                  .18  Obviously the first six categories are the most significant, and all of the categories
comprise permissible consonant-vowel combinations. But it is of interest to know the
average and also maximum lengths and shape-types of the particles to see, among other
things, how they compare with the shapes of finite verbs to which, in a moderate number
of cases, the particles are synchronically related (e.g., particle and verb of the shape
ngorlog-ba).
  In a lexical list of nearly two thousand entries, 150 were finite verbs, 15 (or 16 including
ya- 'go') were CV- roots, 20 CVCV- roots, 18 verbs with inseparable suffix -bu, and 63
with final syllable -ba or -ma. Of these, 26 had stem-initial element of the shape
CVC(C)VC before the -ba ~ -ma suffix, 20 initial element of the shape CVS(onorant),
5 of the shape CVCV, 3 of the shape CVCVCV(C), 2 of the shape CVS(top), 5 of the
shape CVSC where S = sonorant, and one of the shape CVCVR/LG. The proportions
of each type are in keeping with the supposition that these are the result of a long-term
process of verbalization of particles.
  Recall that the verbal suffixal paradigms in Wardaman are highly regular, and that it
only in the CV- roots, and the two roots nyanga- 'come' and jingi- 'sit', that the -ndi Past
tense allomorph is found. It is also only among these verbs, and those with final syllables
-bu, -rla, -nyje, -rna, and some of the CVCV- roots, that the Present allomorph -n is found.
All other verbs, and in particular the class ending in -ba ~ -ma, have no overt Present
suffix, and all take the Past allomorph -rri. It was also noted in 8.2. that there is a small
number of verbs which have a distinctive Future stem-form, mainly those which have
stem-final a, including some monomorphemic roots such as nyanga- 'come', but also
including the class ending in ba ~ -ma. These facts, and especially that the minority and
perhaps relic Past tense allomorph (-ndi) is found only among those verbs which are
clearly of long-standing in that word class, suggest that the direction of historical change
in the language has been towards verbalization of particles, with an accompanying
process of levelling of verbal suffixal allomorphy. The fact that the verbs which end in
ba ~ -ma have distinctive Future stem vocalism, however, is suggestive of intrusion into
the developing majority verb class of a much older distinction between (let us posit and
label) Future and Non-Future stem forms realized in a particular way (the contrast
between / and a vocalism) for some verbs, and which seems to have played a part in the
realization of Irrealis versus Indicative mood categories.","[286, 287]"

8.16. Verb paradigms: The CV- roots, and irregular verbs ya- 'go'
      and vw- 'be'The tense-aspect forms of 13 CV roots, and also of the bisyllabic roots megbe- 'break,
snap', nyanga- 'come' andjingi- 'sit' are shown in Table 14. The latter are included
because they are the only bisyllabic roots to take the Past suffix form -ndi; all other verbs
besides these three, and some of the CV roots, take -ra. It can be seen that, for the most
part, the paradigms are highly predictable and regular. Of all of these verbs, only nyanga-
has a distinctive Future stem-form. The stem-form required in 'admonitive' Irrealis
constructions is not separately listed, but is the same as that which occurs in the Future
tense, minus the tense suffix -wa. The stem form of the positive imperative is the same
as that of Present tense, minus the tense suffix -n, the allomorph found with all the verbs
listed.
  What might be considered a sixteenth CV- root, the verb 'go', requires full paradigmatic
specification because of its irregularity. The forms are set out in Table 15.
  In the Present, two stem forms can be identified, ya- where the immediately preceding
element is nonsingular morpheme -rr-, and -Nja elsewhere. The initial nasal of the latter
stem varies here (as it does throughout the paradigm). Where it immediately follows the
shape yi- (of 2SG, 1INDU), the nasal is palatal; where it follows a or u, it is plain alveolar.
There has clearly been an historical assimilatory process at work in determining the
specification of the nasal.
  Morpheme breaks are not indicated in the Past forms because of their irregularity.
There may be specified two general stem forms, one -(y)anggi following -rr-, and -Njagi,
where the same historical assimilatory processes mentioned above are evident. There
are two further irregularities, however. The 3SG Past is yanggi; and the 1INPL form
which we would expect to be ngarr- (y)anggi is instead ngadjanggi, indicating that in
this form the history of the relationship between -rr- and the following stem is different
than in the 1EXNSG and 3NSG forms to which it is ordinarily analogous. Here as in
some other paradigmatic forms (e.g., Potential) there is a ""trade-off between presence
versus absence of nasal in the stem, and the presence or absence of one in the apparent
form of the suffix. That is, where the form of the root in the past is evidently -ya-, the
past tense marker has a nasal -nggi; but where the root has a nasal, Nja-, the past tense
element is plain -gi.
  On this basis we may say that the Potential has two stem-suffix forms, -Nja-gan, and
-ya-nggan, the latter following -rr- in the expected categories, 1EXNSG, 1INPL and
3NSG. There must be posited both a simple stem form as given, and a doubled one, to
account for the occurrence following -rr- of Potential forms such as 1EXNSG
yirrajanggan, to be analyzed as /yirr-ya-ja-nggan/, with internal hardening of the
reduplicated stem, for example:(473) yirmg-bulu                 gabarri      yirr-ajanggan                  gangga-rlan
      1EXNSG-PL-ABS              also         lEXNSG-go rdp-POT              upriver-ALL
        'We too may go higher up'.

the two basic stem-suffix shapes -Njigbe and -yingbe. The former with initial nasal has
medial g, while the latter with initial palatal continuant has medial velar nasal. It seems
that here too in at least two forms which have the morpheme -rr-, we should identify two
alternative stem forms, a simple and a doubled one, for while these forms are usually as
given, there have been recorded the additional forms 1EXNSG yirr-iyingbe, and 1INPL
ngarr-iyingbe, i.e., suggesting an alternative stem-suffix form -yiyingbe. (No
                                                               Categories of the finite verb 201
comparable form was recorded for 3NSG.) Those given in Table 15 however, are the
usual forms, showing deletion of the palatal glide following -rr-.
  There is additionally a ""second"" Future paradigm, which differs both formally and
semantically from the first, but is much less commonly used. This second Future appears
to have stem shapes -Njiji, -yijingbe, and -Njigbe, thus showing (in the last two forms)
trade-offs between nasal segment stem— initially versus before the Future suffix; but
additionally, showing the distinctive Future stem shape -Njiji. Note that the paradigms
of ""first"" and ""second"" Futures are not completely distinct, for they have common 1INDU
and 3NSG forms. In 1INPL, 1EXNSG and 3NSG, however (i.e., just where there is
nonsingular -rr-), there occurs the doubled stem form -yijingbe, with internal hardening.
This contrasts directly with the few doubled forms without hardening reported in the
previous paragraph (with stem -yiyingbe).
  Forms of this additional Future paradigm have been found mainly in clauses introduced
by the particle gala 'try' (see further 12.2.3.), and also in clauses where they express
obligation, necessity or inevitability in the way Future forms usually do, for example:(474)   yanjiji          wirrig
        3-3SG-go        tomorrow
        'He must• go
                  e> tomorrow'
(475)   ngayugu          gala     nganjiji    jarrambu        gunga
        1SG-ABS         try        ISG-go      looking        3SG-DAT
        Til try to go look for him'.
  The / vocalism of these forms suggests that they are essentially doubled forms of the
Future stem, and (the singulars) old relics of earlier Future formation, without the
distinctive but presumably more recent suffix -wa.
  The present Irrealis forms, given for the sake of completeness, show the alternation
between a stem -ya following -rr- in 1EXNSG, 1INPL and 3NSG, and a stem -Nja
elsewhere. In these forms, the palatal nasal occurs following the Irrealis 2SG person
marker -ni-, and likewise, the 3SG form has palatal nasal following the third person
Irrealis prefix complex yayi-. The Habitual shows the same patterning.
  Although ""admonitive"" is not elsewhere listed as a separate paradigmatic category, it
is worth doing so here because the relationship between Future and admonitive is not
apparently as straightforward as usual — although examination will show that the
admonitive stem forms may in fact be arrived at by eliminating final -gbe or -ngbe from
the corresponding Future forms.
  Finally, there appears to be wider categorial function than usual of the Potential forms.
Although Future (as noted in 8.6. above) is the preferred category in the protasis of
non-past conditionals, there have been recorded several examples of Potential stems
forms of ""go"", with reduction of final -n, and Irrealis prefixation, in the protasis of
non-past conditionals:
202 Chapters(476) bujun       yi-ni-nyjaga       nan-garr          yi-ni-me          wurren

      if         IRR-3-go          inside              lSG/3NSG-hunt-POT
        'If he goes inside, I may hunt them all away'.
  It seems to be the case for ""go"" that Potential forms may be understood to express
volition, intention and necessity in the way that Future does for the majority of verbs.
Thus informants apparently understand Potential ngarranggan wirrig-bi and Future
ngarringbe wirrig-bi to mean something very similar, 'We shall/must go early'. As with
other verbs, however, Future is the preferred form of jussive complement clauses:(478) nan-yi             ngan-yana-rri                 nganjigbe
      that-ERG           3SG/lSG-say-PST               1SG-FUT
        'He/that one told me I must go'.
  Hortative and positive Imperative categories attest the stem forms ya~ and Nja-.
  The verb yu- (reduplicated form yuju-, and generally with auxiliary function) 'to be,
be in a place, exist' is defective in having only Present and non-past subordinate forms.
The latter is irregular: the expected yu-n-ga is not found, the occurring form being
yungga. In other tense-aspect categories, parts of the verb of being and location, jingi-,
are used. Examples of the occurrence of yu- are:(479)   bardab-marla              ya-0-yuju            ngamanda-wu

        A: 'Maybe that thing?' or 'Is that it?'
        B: 'That's the one, we've found it'.
  In (319), A asks using the -warda suffix whether an object might be the one sought
after; the use of the suffix presumably leaves the matter wide open. The particle bago is
often used in such a context, to confirm the identity of something yet with something
mentally formulated (and perhaps sought after) but not previously to hand (see 12.4.2.).

  -warda here qualifies sought-after information which the speaker cannot recall, and
expresses some degree of querulousness at being unable to. A common mode of talking
is to state positively that someone has gone, and then rather than asking ""Where?""
directly, to say something like yilama-gan gudani-warda 'maybe somewhere-or-other';
or simply, gudani-warda 'somewhere-or-other', leaving it open for someone else to
comment or suggest an answer.
  There occur as free words or interjections the combinations warda-gan, conventionally
used to mean Ί don't know', or 'might be like that', 'perhaps'; and also gala-warda with
the same meaning (see 12.2.3. for the particle gala).","[185, 186]"

"12.2.3. Gala 'try'The particle gala has been found in construction with verbs in the following tense-
aspect-mood forms: present, admonitive (marked by zero-stem form or distinctive future
stem, depending on the verb), and imperative. With predicates in present tense, only first
person forms, or pronominal adjuncts which include a first person, have been found to
occur. That is, with present tense which expresses relative certainty or imminence of
unfulfilled action, apparently only first persons (or first-plus-others) can have the
appropriate intentional status as actors. In construction with gala, although formal
admonitive and imperative forms have both been found to occur, the former are
uncommon, and semantically not clearly distinct from the imperative, among other
reasons because such forms have only been found with second person subjects. The only
difference may be between admonitive and imperative that the former make the
imperative force of the utterance slightly less, or more tentative. See discussion
following the examples concerning why gala may occur with ""admonitive"" future-tense
forms, and not with the ordinary future (8.6.). First, examples of gala with first person
(plus) pronominal adjuncts, and present tense forms are:

  If gala were equivalent to English ""try"", it should be possible to use it in the past tense.
The fact that this is not possible shows that gala is not equivalent to English ""try"", and
that its core meaning is one of uncertainty concerning an as-yet unrealised state of affairs.
Combined with the present tense, gala expresses intention of the first person (plus) subject.
  Combined with first- or second-person subject future-admonitive forms, it expresses
either the subject's inner sense of necessity to do what the predicate designates (first
persons), or the attribution (to second persons) of an intentional force. Notice then how
such future-admonitive forms appear to differ from the ordinary future, e.g., nganjigbe
Ί will go, I must go', in which no sense of indeterminacy or uncertainty is attributable
to the subject, but rather only unmitigated volition, intention, or necessity to the subject-
predicate combination as a whole. The ordinary future, in other words (see 8.6.) is a form
of the verb which expresses all such meanings but without clearly distinguishing if, or
the extent to which, they are to be attributed to the subject, or exactly where necessity
and intentionality are to be located. The distinctive future-stem or admonitive
construction differs from the ordinary future precisely in modality, in that it expresses
uncertainty (and most generally, undesirability) of an as-yet unrealised state of affairs. It
is thus possible for it (rather than the ordinary future) to co-occur with gala. With
imperative forms, gala expresses the clearer attribution of uncertainty to the agency of
the second person subject, i.e., ""you try to do X"" (but you may not succeed).
  Seeing ""uncertainty"" as the core semantic dimension of gala, with different
modulations of intentionality varying with tense-aspect-mood form of the verb, helps to
understand the interjectional formation possible with this particle, gala-warda, best
translated as either Ί don't know', or more generally'who knows?','it's not clear', where
the uncertainty is understood in relation to the speaker as a pragmatic effect of the usage
of the expression. Here, gala is paired with the indefinite suffix -warda (7.5.8.), and is
thus a regular member of the set of forms which may be so suffixed, expressing general
uncertainty. Examples of usage of this form are shown in the following conversation-like
sequences (invented by informants without suggestion as to content, to illustrate the
meaning of gala-warda):(734) A:       guda-ni         0-yanggi        jangari      yilama-gan 0-yanggi

        A:     'Where has jangari gone, maybe he's gone south'.
        Β:     Ί don't know, maybe/I think you saw [him]'.","[319, 320, 321]"

7.2. Demonstrative categories and some related forms
The demonstrative pronouns, may serve either as modifiers within a nominal phrase, or
like all sub-types of nominal in Wardaman, may by themselves constitute the sole,
reference-making member of a nominal phrase. As modifiers, they normally occur
within a phrase preceding the modified, but the reverse order may be found (10.3., 10.9.).
As modifiers and arguments, the demonstrative pronouns may be inflected for the range
of nominal case-suffixes.
  The system of demonstratives shows a tripartite division in terms of spatial categories
which will be called ""Immediate"", ""Proximate"" and ""Remote"". These categories are
roughly translatable in English as ""this"", ""that"" and ""yonder"", and the spatial and textual
semantics of all of them will be illustrated below. In summary fashion, the spatial
reference of the Immediate category is in the vicinity of the speech situation, and may
designate within the vicinity of the speaker, hearer or both. Something that is designated
as ""that"" in the sense of distal from speaker but close to hearer is liable to be coded with
the Proximate category, but never with the remote category as it is still within range of
the location of the speech event. The Immediate and Remote categories are the most
closely linked in most of their uses to spatial semantics, although forms of the immediate
category may have textually immediate reference to that just said or about to be said.
The Remote category is most restricted to spatial reference in the extra-linguistic context
138 Chapter?(as opposed to linguistic), and its use seems to be to refer to things, objects, locations etc.
which are generally visible from the location of the speech event, or portrayed as visible
from the perspective of a narrated or reported speech event, but in either case distal from
it.
   This leaves relatively unspecified the proximate category, which is in fact widest of the
three in its range of uses, and the least restricted in its textual and other extended
distribution. As noted above, it may designate within the general vicinity of the speech
situation something that is distal from speaker and close to hearer, or something that is
distal from both but still relatively close. Further, it is the category generally used to
code the textual familiarity of some nominal, where its use often amounts to specification
of definiteness of the referent via its proximate text-spatial semantics. In this definite-
marking usage it is often best translated by English definite article. It is also the category
most widely used to mark the relation of units of text to others, by means of inflected
forms which mean such things as ""and then, after that"", and so on.
  Case forms in the three series are shown in Table 12. Stem morphology is not
complicated: each series has an Absolutive form, and a stem-form used with non-zero
suffixes. The two stems differ most unpredictably for the remote category.","[161, 162]"
"12.5.9. Baway 'come' and gaba 'come on'The unanalyzable interjection baway means Over here, come on'. In the text where
people out looking for water in a dry area come upon a supply, they shout to others as
follows:
                                              Clausal particles, conjunctions and interjections 329
(850) baway            dan-bi-wi          yi-jad
      come on          this-ART-ART       YI-big-ABS
       'Come on, right here there is a lot [of water]!'.
  While baway may thus be equivalent to an imperative verb, the particle gaba always
precedes one, and seems to be a verbal gesture, having a hailing and beckoning sense.
See (796) above for an illustration, with gaba bega lawu 'hey come and get tobacco!' It
is most common followed by an imperative form of nyanga- 'come': gaba nyanga 'hey
come on!', 'hey come here!' 'come on over here'.

"  Possibly, given its usual position before the finite verb, the post-verbal position, and
particularly the tone-group final position gives a special prominence to the predicate
meaning expressed by the particle.
  In general, insofar as a determinate semantic relation can be posited between particles
and finite verbs, the former may be said to restrict the latter in that they contribute a
specificity of meaning that the latter does not have by itself. Particles do not regularly
combine with each other to constitute predicate meanings in the way, for example, two
or several verbal roots regularly serialize in some New Guinean languages; examples
with more than two particles within the same finite clause have not been found, and those
of two are not regular, idiomatic combinations. Where two particles occur together, there
seems to be a regular semantic relationship between them of the following two kinds.
First, one of the particles might be described as semantically more specific than the other.
It is one that enters into regular combination with the finite verb in a unique lexical
predicate meaning. The other particle is more general than the first, semantically
compatible with it, and refines or elaborates it semantically. This second particle tends
to be of such generality that, along a notional spectrum of predicate modification such
as was mentioned in Chapter 4, it might fall into the category of adverb.
  In the second sort of case, there again exists a relation of semantic compatibility,
perhaps even partial synonymy, between the two particles, which need not be contiguous
within the clause, and together they reinforce a particular predicate meaning, or express
a conjunction of partly similar, paired meanings. The relation of specificity and
generality typical of the first sort of case is not found here; instead, the two particles
appear to be of approximately equal lexical specificity. Examples of these sorts of
combinations follow.(614) nan-guya            nganburr-ga-ndi-ya-marla                         buda-wu

254 Chapter 10
   This example might be seen to illustrate both types of particle cooccurrence
characterized above. First, in the second line there is the combination girdibun-ma which
means 'finish, end' (and as a nominal modifier may mean ""all, the whole lot"") together
with the particle plus verb combination yarr-ma ya- 'to diminish, tail off, end', often used
of seasonal rains. The former particle is more general than the first in that it expresses
completion more broadly, and restricts the following lexical combination, producing a
meaning something like ""when it ended completely, altogether"". In the last line is the
combination bogogo ngurlmud, of the second sort, where one particle cannot be seen as
restricting or modifying the other, because they are of approximately equal lexical
specificity, semantically compatible in that each designates activities defined in
opposition to staying put, being in camp and the like. The result is a more conjunctive
kind of expression: ""foraging and camping out"".(615) lurle      wu-lu-rri-ya     ngawurnen                   mulerr-ma

        Ά great number [of them] cried and grieved/cried in mourning'.
  (615) may be considered an instance of the second kind, where there is a relation of
semantic compatibility and partial synonymy between the two particles, lurle used in the
meaning 'cry, weep' and mulerr-ma with connotations of public, loud, grieving and
mourning, particularly for a death. Together the particles encode and reinforce a single
predicate meaning (as opposed to a more clearly conjunctive one of the bogogo ngurlmud
type).(616) nganinggin   yibiwi                   0-lu-rri-ya           nganu    na_

        'My father cried for me now he worried and longed for me'.
  In (616), moyin-ma (which, like some other constructions of sentiment and affect,
occurs with the Absolutive nominal mejern 'stomach', see 10.4.), apparently conveys a
sense of worry or concern, while luyurr-ma designates longing, pining, or sometimes
compassion for. The combination seems to be conjunctive, rather than one particle
restricting the other.(617)   warlarrgu       wud-janga-ndi                werrwerr
        outside         3NSG-come-PST                outwards rdp
        'They came outside'.
  As first briefly mentioned in 7.6.3., in Wardaman as in Wakiman (see Cook 1987:253),
there is a common use of two orientational particles which locate action or state as
""outwards"", ""outside"" and ""inwards, inside"" (but the relational sense, or the relation to
something else, of both terms may sometimes not be very precisely defined or explicitly
indicated). In Wardaman, the most common term that designates 'inside, inwards' is
                                                         Issues in constituency and word order 255
warljub(-a), and this is more adverbial than specifically particle-like, in that it readily
occurs with any number of finite verbs, and is not particularly strongly associated with
any, in anything approximating a regular particle plus finite verb combination. There is,
however, a second particle wululu 'inwards, inside', which while it may combine with
any verb of motion (""come"", ""go"" etc.), tends to occur with special frequency with we-,
which by itself means 'fall'. The combination wululu we-, however, does not mean to
""fall in(side)"", but rather simply 'go inside, motion inwards' wululu ngerr-we-n 'let us
go inside'.
  The particle werr-ma Outwards, outside' is often used to describe the situation of
people emerging from the countryside into a camp or habited place, approximately 'they
came out'; it is used to describe where rivers and creeks come ""out"" or debouche; and to
describe the emergence of dreaming figures from the landscape or from a position covert
within landforms into the visible world, or into a particular place. As in (610), this particle
may occur with other forms such as warlarrgu, generally used (now, at least) to talk about
Outside' a house or other structure as opposed to inside, and of such generality that it
might be designated an adverb as easily as a particle. Although werr is also of
considerable generality (i.e., it is used to describe the ""outward"" motion or position of a
large range of arguments), it is more particle- than adverb-like in that it is regularly found
in lexical-syntactic combination with the finite verb bu- to express action or motion
outwards (although it MAY also occur with other verbs). Thus, the coocurrence of
warlarrgu and werr would seemingly be best described semantically as one of a more
general item modifying a more specific one, and together expressing not just emergence
Outwards' (i.e., the inward to outward trajectory of werr), but to the outside (the general
location designated by warlarrgu).
  The examples presented so far have been of particles cooccurring within a single clause
on a tone unit, where each particle (or adverb) is associated with the finite verb of the
clause, each in the same way, or one apparently modifying or restricting the other. It
often happens in connected narrative that particles are used without a finite verb but
simply with a major argument of a (partly realized) clause, often the object, as in the
following:(618)   wurr-bel-wu-rri-ya             girdibun
        3NSG-slice-PST-NAR             finish        wolon            barlbarlb           wurr-gi-ndi-ya-wuya                      gunga

        'They sliced it, that's all (finished)
        the two of them spread the grass out for it
        heap up stones, spread out grass'.
  Especially given the preceding context, the last tone unit can be easily understood
despite the absence of any finite verb. There are many textual examples elsewhere of a
256 Chapter 10tone group consisting of one or two grammatically complete clauses, and then an
""appended"" particle without finite verb, final or near-final within the tone group. The
effect of this kind of ""incomplete"" structure is to indicate that the action, condition etc.
designated by the particle should be interpreted in relation to the rest of the tone group,
and in direct relation to major arguments within it. Insofar as ""ellipsis"" is used to mean
that some constituent formerly present has been zeroed, the term does not seem
appropriate. We seem to be dealing with instances in which the particle SUGGESTS the
fuller verbal expression. The following set of examples should illustrate this common
textual effect:(619) wurr-ga-ndi-ya         nana       magulu          rm                dun    wiya-ya

      'They took the yam now and tipped it into water'.
  A usual combination with particle dun 'tip, pour' is the finite verb wudba-. In (619),
however, there is no finite verb with dun, but the object of the particle is clearly understood
to be the immediately preceding magulu, and the subject, the 3NSG pronominal on the verb.(620)    wurr-me-ndi            jubung
         3NSG-AUX-PST            grind

         3NSG-eat-PST
        'They ground the charcoal and mixed it with water
        mixed it with water and ate it'.
  Here a few lines are given to establish that there has been one instance of ""they ground
it"", with particle jubung and finite verb me-; the object, 'charcoal', is separately specified
and then repeated in the third line, which ends with particle ngay 'mix, stir', and no finite
verb. The following line begins with the finite verb (me- is the usual finite verb with
ngay, while jubung commonly occurs with both bu- and me-), a repetition of ""with
water"", and of the particle itself.(621)   marlarluga                 nurdurd

        wurren
        child-ABS
        '[they put] the old men in a heap
        they heaped them up
        they just shot them and heaped them
        they shot little tiny kids and all'.
  The particle without finite verb occurs in the third line: duyma 'heap' normally occurs
with the finite verb gi-. The following line does not return to more fully specify that
predicate, however, but returns to the theme of shooting and the fact that even little
children were killed.(622)   gud     0-gaju-rri          worroman-bi         wardabarrb
        arise   3SG-AUX-PST         quickly-ART         leap/start        gayardung       0-yanggi   yirrgulun                     judjud
        run             3SG-AUXPST river-ABS                     descend
        'He got up quickly with a start
        ran and descended to the river'.
  The first line might be interpreted as a combination of particles of compatible
semantics, gud more general in that it designates arising, getting up, and wardabarrb
more specific in that while it implies arising, it also specifies the manner in which it is
done as sudden, or unexpected. Both gud and wardabarrb normally occur (in
intransitive clauses) with finite verb gaju-. That is, it is probably not appropriate to see
wardabarrb as the particle of a truncated or ellipsed clause, but as the second member
of a particle combination with gud. In the second line, however, we may posit that
yirrgulun judjud are members of an incompletely specified predication ""and descended
to the river"". Indications that this string never achieves clausal status are: first, that
yirrgulun is Absolutive, instead of Allative as one might expect in a fully developed
clause; and secondly, \hatjudjud normally occurs with we- in the meaning 'descend',
and therefore may be interpreted as occurring here without finite verb. The latter point
is somewhat equivocal, for judjud also regularly occurs with the verbs of motion 'go'
and 'come'; however, given the lack of case-marking on 'river', we may interpret this as
a textually-cohesive fragment, rather than as a particle-combination with finite verb να-.
  A passage similar in context occurs further on in the same text from which (622) was
drawn:(623)    gayardung      0-yanggi              gunya            yirrgulu-warr         barrwa

        black soil-LOC
258 Chapter 10
        'He ran away from him and down to the river
        along the river and came up and out on black soil'.
  Here the particlejudjud is once again apparently not directly paired with a finite verb
(though the ""river"", the place to which the subject descended, is regularly case-marked).
The meaning is perfectly clear because of the surrounding specification of the nature and
direction of action.(624)   galul wurr-(y)anggi           worroman-bi        gayardung        julu-ya

        duba
        sit-PS
        'They ran up quickly and sat down on the hill'.
   The particle duba is here without finite verb, normally.//«!»/-, but again its absence does
not impair intelligibility.
   Although such unpaired particles commonly occur tone-group finally, as so far
illustrated, they may also occur in other positions, especially group-initially:(625)   wardarl          0-yana-rri           ngawun
        struggle         3SG-AUX-PST          nothing        new        wardang         0-wudba-rri
        grab       belly-up        3SG-AUX-PST
        'She struggled, nothing [to no avail]
        he grabbed and threw her belly-up'.
  The particle new 'grab' is unpaired; it usually occurs with me-, and does not occur by
itself in combination with \vudba- (which as independent verb means 'throw', and
obviously retains some ofthat semantic content in its combination with wardang). 'Grab'
in such a construction as this obviously has the same nominal arguments as wardang.
  While further above were illustrated kinds of particle combinations which may be seen
as members of a single finite clause, in the immediate preceding examples we have what
should be regarded as particle adjuncts of less than full clausal status to a single clause.
These adjuncts add to the development of text, and are related to the fully specified clause
in a way that presupposes the sharing of major arguments and argument functions by the
particles, and the applicability of other verbal categories (tense-aspect) to the additional
particle as well as to the clause as a whole. These constructions cannot, however, taken
to be serialized ones insofar as ""serialization"" is understood to mean the regular
combination of predicates in determinate lexical meanings. The constructions illustrated
here are textual ones, i.e. not essentially analyzable at the clause level, though they
certainly interact with and are constrained by clause-level structure. The particle
adjunction effects a close textual linkage between the major clausal predicate(s) and the
adjoined one. This packaging of narrative material is most closely comparable to the
inclusion, within a single tone-group, of more than one finite clause. While comparable,
these processes must be distinguished.

 Inclusion of two full clauses within a single tone group is common, although it is
unusual in the narratives collected for a tone group to contain MORE than TWO clauses.
Examples of two clauses within a single tone unit follow.(626) belgin             wurr-ngu-ndi         wurr-wemi-yi-rri

        Ί put water, I dipped it up'.
  These examples show that, in the textual linking of two full clauses by prosodic means
only, although it often happens that the two finite verbs share an object, or (perhaps better
put) presuppose the same object, they may in fact have different subjects and/or objects.
(629) illustrates different subjects of the two prosodically-Iinked predicates, the linkage
highlighting precisely their opposite direction of movement: as one went down the other
went up. The prosodic linkage of full clauses on a tone unit, then, is an even more
explicitly ""textual"" (rather than ""grammatical"") device than is particle adjunction; for
the latter operates in terms of the sharing of core arguments among all predicate
constituents and the controlling of verbal categories by the finite verb.
                            Chapter 11
      Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements
11.1. Introduction: Special properties of particlesMany languages in this region, like Wardaman, have predicate structures of more than
one kind, some of which consist of more than one word. Verbal construction types were
described in 8.1., and the distinction was made between predicate structures consisting
only of finite verb, and those consisting of verbal ""particle"" (following some long-
standing Australianist usage, see Dixon ed. 1976) and finite verb. We saw that among
the finite verbs which may occur as predicators by themselves, with full lexical meaning,
are high-frequency verbs (including most of the CV- roots) which also occur widely with
verb particles, to constitute most of the language's verbal lexicon. It was shown that
there is moderate flexibility in alternative pairings of the same particle with different
verbs, and that this kind of alternation, besides making differences in lexical meaning,
also instantiates differences in clause-level transitivity in what was accordingly termed
a ""lexico-syntactic"" manner. This kind of transitivity system is consistent with the fact
that there tends to be a strong coincidence between particular verb and either transitive
or intransitive clause type (e.g., bu-, gi- etc. transitive, jingi- intransitive). However, a
simple dichotomy between transitive and intransitive clauses and/or predicates was
argued to be inappropriate, mainly because of the considerable degree to which verbs
which, as clausal predicates by themselves determine transitive clause structure, with
particles may instantiate the Absolutive-Dative clause type.
  Although particle plus verb constructions occur in many other languages of the area,
their range of functions is rather distinctive of the group of presumed congeners including
Wardaman (for Wakiman, see Cook 1987 Chapter 9; the same range of functions is
indicated by the more limited material available for Yangman). Particles in these
languages have at least two major functions: first, they productively occur with finite
verbs to express predicate meanings; and second, case-marked in a number of ways that
will be described in this chapter, they form clausal complements. It is in this second
range of functions that the particle system of Wardaman and congeners is particularly
distinctive, as compared with other regional languages. For example in the languages
immediately to the east (of the Wardaman-Yangman dialect continuum), Mangarrayi and
Alawa, particle plus verb constitutes the usual kind of predicate construction. But the
extent to which particles in those languages may be used in adclausal complement
constructions is very limited, and in particular, there is no parallel to the Allative-marked
complements described in 11.4.3. and 11.7. Though the particle plus verb construction
type of all of these languages is superficially similar, the differences in syntactic
distribution of the particles support the view that we are not dealing with similar syntactic
systems. There appear, also, to be some, much more minor differences between
Wardaman and Wakiman in the way that particles function: in Wardaman they do not
262 Chapter 11
occur alone, without finite verb, as imperative utterances (Cook 1987: 253). This
difference may be related to some others, e.g., the fact that the 'particle suffix' in
Wardaman (11.1.2.) cannot be clearly associated with aspectual categorial meaning in
the way it apparently can in Wakiman (Cook 1987: 235).","[277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286]"

5.7. Article suffix ~bi ~ -mAn article-like ending -bi —wi (see 3.6.) may be suffixed to many parts of speech, most
commonly to nominals, to adverbs, and more rarely, to verb particles. In general, the
article ending contributes specificity or concreteness to the meaning of the form to which
it is suffixed, but it does this in slightly different ways for different word classes.
   The article is suffixed to nominals of both substantive and adjectival kinds. In (138),
suffixed to body parts specifying the focus of action, it gives greater concreteness to their
involvement in the hitting:(138) 0-bu-ndi-ya                   darang-bi                  banggin-bi
      3SG/3SG-hit-PST               rump ABS-ART               back ABS-ART
        'He hit his rump part, back part'.
  With words designating place or geographic feature, the article equally contributes
specificity, and often is to be interpreted as having a pergressive sense with respect to the
predicate:(139) yirrgulun-bi                ya-0-gomarla-n
      river ABS-ART               3-3SG-follow-PRES
       'He is following along the river'.
  Notice the article is suffixed to Absolutive case-form.
  With nominals which specify condition or status, the contribution of the article is to
create something like a clausal complement meaning ""at the time of X"", or ""when X"",
where X is the condition or status.
                                                     Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 93(140) wudu-wi        0-ba-ndi              wuja-yi

      'As a young person he is turning grey-haired'.
 See also (108) above, a similar kind of example.(142) 0-nyanga-ndi     yi-merrug           yinggiya-wanda      danani
      3SG-come-PST YI-spirit-ABS whoABS-EMPH this-ABS

      'Who in the world is this spirit that has come? This is that same old woman
      who's come back from the west'.
  The above is from a text about child spirits. The speaker imitates someone's wondering
reaction to seeing such a spirit — ""Who is this?"" He then imitates recognition of the spirit
— ""It is the same one"", i.e., a previously known person who has returned in spirit form.
  The article suffix's occurrence with adverbs might be described as partly inflectional,
partly derivational. It may be freely suffixed to such adverbs as bulgu 'in the middle'
(bulgu-wi, or reduplicative bulgulgu-wi), to give greater concreteness to the specification
of locality; and to the specification of time with such adverbs as wirrig 'tomorrow',
dalgan 'forenoon, daytime', and bulju 'long ago':(143) bulju-wi         0-yanggi       yiwarna                   gandawag
      longago-ART      3SG-goPST other-ABS                      moon-ABS
      'He went long ago, last month'.
  It is now apparently inseparable in such adverbs as burrugawi 'long ago', which is not
attested without it.
  The article suffix is widely attested with demonstratives following certain other suffixes
such as locational -beng ~ -\veng (7.2.3.): dan-beng-bi 'right here in this place'.
Apparently doubled instances of the article suffixes have been recorded only with
demonstratives (not with other parts of speech), as in the following examples:(144) nana          0-bardarrma-rri     walanja-yi       gaya      yi-balanggin
      that-ABS      3SG-scratch-PST goanna-ERG           today    YI-newABS

      Ά goanna has scratched that anew today, [I] reckon he's underneath right
      here'.

      ya-0-jingi-n
      3-3SG-be-PRES
        'He's sitting in the grass with only his head out, he's right there'.
  Although the article suffix has been found to occur with forms which normally function
as verb particles, it is arguable that the suffix permits them to occur in a more distinctly
nominal function, that is, with nominal reference. In examples (146) and (147), the
article is suffixed to warduj which usually is paired with verbs of motion in the meaning
'disappear, vanish'; and wabaja likewise usually enters into combinations where it
means 'to get lost'.(146) warduj-bi                   wurr-bu-ndi
      disappear-ART                3NSG-hit-PST
        'They beat him out of sight'.(147) wabaja-wi      wurr-jarram-bu-rri go:::          ngawun                   wonggo
      lost-ART       3NSG-look-PST                     3SG DAT nothing          neg
      birdij    wurr-gi-ndi
      find      3NSG-AUX-PST
        ""They looked around for him lost [one], nothing, they never found him'.
  Finally, it must be noted that there sometimes occurs a suffix of shape -yi which, while
its contribution to meaning remains somewhat difficult to specify, must apparently be
distinguished from -wi. An example which shows the two in close proximity is:(148) dirlyag-ba      wu-da-yi-rri-wuya                        wudu-wuya-wi
      sweetheart-PS   3NSG-AUX-RR-PST-DU                       little-DU-ART
      wudu-wunba-yi
      little-SOU-ADV?
       'They were sweethearts [from the time/when] the two of them were little,
       from little'.
  While the suffix -wi is clearly the article, -yi is probably to be related to the general
adverbial suffix mentioned above as common following adverbial -barra, and illustrated
in (112). There are forms with which seemingly either -wi or -yi may occur: notable
among these is the interjection meaning ""OK, all right, enough"", the usual form of which
is yilgba-yi. Suffixed with -wi, this appears to have a more clearly substantival character,
as in:(149) yilgba-wi         yi-dagbarla-n
      OK-ART             2SG-have-PRES
       'You have enough'.

5.8. Experiential and anaphoric specifiers
There is a suffix -wunyin (often realized as [winyin]) by means of which the speaker
presents that to which it is suffixed as having specific or particular reference. This may
or may not have been established textually: the form is not a textual anaphor, but rather
a (performative) marker of experiential specificity. It is a form for which one kind of
Kriol equivalent is a reinforcing use of ""now"": ""this one now"", ""me now"", etc.
  The first examples will be drawn from one text which is particularly rich in the use of
this suffix. The speaker tells of a place called Mawuya-ya, literally ""at the poison"", or
""poison place"". He describes how he or someone like him, closely affiliated to the place,
might go there to ask for poison in order to harm someone else. (The speaker explains
that people used to do this). He begins the story (divided into prosodic lines) as follows,
with an address by himself as visitor to the place:(150) dana-winyin
      this ABS-SPEC
      ngayugu
      1SGABS
      muymuy-munggayin
      [place]-territorial ABS
      mawuya            dana              nga-lawu-n
      poison-ABS this-ABS                 ISG-come toget-PRES
      'This one here [i.e., the speaker], me, a person of Muymuy, I come to get
      this poison'.
  The first line is the speaker's way of getting the place's attention; and he does so by
telling the place that he is someone here, now, known. Later he adds:(151) mad-barra       yinga-yana                 go
      word-ADV        IRR ISG-say PRES           3SG DAT
      ngayugu-winyin          yi-laglawun                 yibiwan

      1SGABS          ISG-come-PRES
      Ί might say to it: me now, a man of this place, X is my name, I've come'.
  The suffix is added following non-zero case-endings, e.g., nan-gu-winyin yum-gu Of
that particular kind of tree'.
  One text about a place again began with this suffix in the first line, that is with a
formulation by the speaker that the place is already referentially established or specific:(152) wu-dab          wu-dab-winyin          ya-0-jingi-n
      WU-cave         WU-cave-SPEC 3-3SG-be-PRES
      'The cave, the particular cave is there ...'.
96 Chapters  And another speaker talking of bush foods she used to eat said:(153) jarrug   go     nan-gu   galawarra-wu                    lany-gu  nana-winyin
      egg-ABS 3SG DAT that-DAT pigeon-DAT                      game-DAT that ABS-SPEC
       'Eggs of the spinifex pigeon, [exactly] that...'.
  It seems quite probable that etymologically, this suffix is to be regarded as nominal
class prefix wu- followed by monosyllabic stem -nyin.
  There is a suffix -marlang, much less frequent in the data, which contrasts with -winyin
in that it appears to be much more clearly a textual anaphor. Its use signals that something
has previously been referred to, or established, somewhere in the discourse. It is a kind
of category which often seems to find an equivalent in Kriol usage of the demonstrative
""that"" as textual anaphor.
  -marlang is added to nouns and demonstratives, following any overt case- marker, and
has been also recorded on subordinate (NP-relative type) verb forms. The suffix itself
is invariant in form. It occurred in a story about a fight between brolga and emu, in which
both had previously been introduced, but emu had not been mentioned for some time.(154) gumurrinji-marlang      bagbag 0-bu-ndi                 yi-warli           bag
      emu-ΑΝΑ                 break   3-AUX-PST               YI-arm-ABS         break
      yi-bam           darang       wayana
      YI-head-ABS      rump-AB S    and all
       'He broke the arm of that emu, broke his head and rump and all'.
 In another part of the same story we find:(155) bornorro-yi-marlang         debgarra    wunggun-bu-ndi-ya             duy-ma nard
      brolga-ERG-ANA              hiding      3SG/3NSG-hit-PST-NAR          heap-PS lot
       'That brolga beat the whole lot [emu's children] to a pulp'.
 From camp conversation the following example was recorded:(156) layin-marlang               ngerr-me-we           dog-ba
      meat ABS-ANA                1 INPL-get-FUT        cut-PS
       'That meat, we have to get a cut [half, quarter] of it'.
  In a text about marriage, the speaker has been describing the kind of man to whom an
additional wife would be promised, and has mentioned that such a man would be expected
to work for, and to dance in ceremony for, his (promised) mother-in-law. Later in this
text we find:(157) nana              yi-warna-gari            yi-namun-garang
      that-ABS          YI-other-other-ABS       YI-sister-having-ABS

                                                     Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 97
       'The other one who has [is married to] the elder sister, that one who [as
       mentioned] dances for her, that's the one to whom they give her'.
  (157) illustrates -nrarlang suffixed to a subordinate verb form, which already has a
more nominal character in that it describes ""one who dances"". This example also shows
clearly the functional difference between -warlang and -wnnyin.
  In a text about social classification, the speaker has been bemoaning, as older people
often do, the laxity of present sexual and marital partnerships, and says:(158) gaya-warlang         ngawurnen       wu-warlam                  wagbawun
      today-ΑΝΑ            whole lot       WU-skin-ABS                lacking
       'Today [as I've said] it's open slather, there arc no skins' [i.e., there is no
       observance of appropriate restrictions].
 (158) illustrates the very general kind of textually anaphoric function that -niarlang
may have.
 There were lengthy texts in which this suffix did not occur at all.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"

3.4. Final syllable reduction in nominal stemsThere is a pervasive process of final syllable reduction in nominal stems before non-zero
suffix. However, one finds that to some of the same stems that are often reduced, on
other occasions speakers will add case and other endings without reduction. That is, the
process of reduction appears at least partly facultative. Elicitation concerning this matter
reveals an extensive speaker willingness to accept either particular reduced forms as
described below, or unreduced stem forms (with a few exceptions where speakers will
only accept the unreduced form as inflecting stem, e.g., with banggin 'back'). In general,
then, we are not dealing with a matter of strict grammaticality. Despite the apparent
speaker flexibility, one finds from both elicitation and text materials that a certain stem
form, either reduced or unreduced, is the most common for a particular noun, when the
speaker is asked to use the noun in some context, rather than to concentrate on the
acceptability of one or another stem form. There are only a few nouns for which the
reduction process seems to be truly optional in a statistical sense. Therefore, I will
include some comments below about the most common forms for particular nouns.
  Cook (1987: 80-83) describes a generally similar process in Wakiman, but the details
differ considerably for each language. Wardaman and Yangman are much more similar
to each other in respect of this process than either is to Wakiman.
  In Wardaman, a significant number of nominals (nouns and adjectival nouns) end in
final syllable -CVn. However, it seems for purposes of describing the reduction process
we should distinguish between final -Cin syllables, for some of which (depending partly
on the identity of C) there is often reduction up to and including the entire syllable; and
final -CVn, by which here we understand V to be any vowel besides /. In the latter type,
reduction is simply of the final -n, which may therefore be identified synchronically as
an Absolutive suffix for large numbers of nominals, and historically as that, and/or as
some sort of nominal derivational suffix. (It is also the latter synchronically, see 11.1.4.).
  Taking the simplest case first, that of -CVn in the sense identified above, we may
exemplify loss of final -n before non-zero ending with luwun 'cave', bomdoyorron
'pandanus', gangman 'kangaroo' and wurren 'child'. Usual case forms for such nouns
are, e.g., Locative luwu-ya 'in the cave', Allative luwu-warr 'into the cave', and Ablative
luwu-wa 'from the cave'; Locative borndoyorro-ya 'in the pandanus', borndoyorro-warr
'to the pandanus', and borndoyorro-wa 'from the pandanus'; Ergative gangma-yi
'kangaroo', Dative gangma-wu; Ergative wurre-yi 'child', Dative wurre-wu, Dual
Absolutive wurre- wuya, Plural Absolutive wurre-mulu, and so on.
   Adjectival nouns like the word Wardaman itself commonly undergo reduction. For
example, from that stem may be created a form meaning explicitly ""Wardaman
language"", with class prefix wu-. Usually (but not invariably) reduced and inflected with
an adverbial suffix, this expression is commonly used to mean ""by means of the
Wardaman language, in Wardaman"": wu-wardama-warra (one also finds simply
                                                                        Process phonology 29
wardama-warra, and also wardaman-barra is acceptable though appears to be less
common in actual usage when attention is not focused on the reduction process).
   For all -CVn nominals with minimally bisyllabic root (i.e., excluding such nouns as
wu-bin 'thumb', to which the process does not apply) reduction is far more common
before non-zero affix than is retention of -n.
   There is at least one high-frequency nominal to which -n is commonly added to create
an inflecting (Ergative) stem-form, where the -n does not appear in the Absolutive. This
is lege One', which has alternative (and approximately equally used) Ergative forms
lege-yi and lege-n-yi. Other cases are built on the zero stem.
   There is greater variability in patterning among nominals with final syllable -Cin, and
it seems we ought to distinguish at least three sub-types here, though most of them exhibit
some internal variability. These are: nominals with final syllable -Nin, where N is a nasal;
of final syllable -L/R/Y where L is a lateral, R a rhotic, Υ the semivowel; and of type
-Sin, where S is a stop (and here, the most variable sub-set of this sort has final syllable
-gin; variation is linked to the segment which precedes this final syllable).
   Nominals with final -Nin are the least variable. The inflecting stem is formed by
reduction of -in. Examples are: Absolutive linin 'snake', ERG lin-yi, DAT lin-gu;
Absolutive yumin 'tree, wood', INST yum-nyi (see 3.5.4. for the assimilatory process
here), LOG yum-nya, DAT yum-gu, Adverbial yum-barra; ABS langganin 'billabong',
LOG langgan-nya, etc. However, there is some variation in longer stems of this
description as to whether they reduce or not; e.g., Absolutive marranyin 'sand, sugar',
has alternative inflected forms Ablative marranyin-ba or marrany-ba, 'having' forms
marranyin-garang or marrany-garang, and so on. In my data the reduced forms are more
common than unreduced for trisyllabic -Nin stems.
   However, it is important to mention that some nouns with final nasal segment, where
this was preceded by another consonant (i.e., there would have remained a cluster after
syllable reduction), were found not to conform to the -Nin pattern described above, but
rather reduced only -n, or not at all. An example of this kind is warlngin 'fly', which had
usual and acceptable case-inflected forms of the sort warlngi-yi or warlngin-yi (ERG).
Below it becomes clear that the presence of stem-final clusters is a factor relevant to
reduction where other segments types are involved.
   The second sub-type is -L/R/Yin, where the syllable margin is a non-nasal sonorant.
Here the most common pattern seems to be for final syllable to lose -in, but loss of just
-n is attested in some nouns, and (perhaps relevant) particularly commonly with certain
kinds of suffixes. There are also in the class two high-frequency nouns layin 'game, meat',
and mayin 'vegetable food', and besides conforming to the minority pattern in that both
typically lose only -n, the former is idiosyncratic in its possible stem-forms.
  The most general pattern for this sub-type, loss of-in, can be illustrated by the common
nouns, Absolutive forms of which arejerrin 'ground oven', warnarrin 'fat', and bulilin
'blood': Locative jerr-ya, Ablative jerr-wa, DAT jerr-wu; DAT warnarr-wu, 'having'
warnarr-warang; 'having' bulil-warang ('menstruating'). However, non-reduced
alternatives are accepted for most such nouns (e.g., LOG jerrin-nya), though they are
not in fact as commonly used.
30 Chapters   One problem with saying that reduction of -in is the most common pattern is that, for
 nouns of the -L/K/Yin sub-type, those that, because of the nature of their referents, most
 typically occur in Ergative case-form, have been found to show reduction of only -n in
 that form. Examples are: ABS garlirlin 'mosquito', ERG garlirli-yi; ABSjuwarin 'Long
 Tom', ERG juwari-yi; ABS geyirrin 'dew, frost', ERG geyirri-yi; ABS murrurin
 'mud-dauber', ERG murruri-yi. However, some of the same nouns have other common
 inflectional or derivational forms which show loss of -in, e.g., geyirr-warang 'dewy,
 frosty'. While informants readily accept geyirrin-garang, they do not accept geyirri-
 warang. For any of the above nouns, informants will produce and readily accept
 unreduced forms, e.g., geyirrin-yi 'dew' (ERG), or garlirlin-yi 'mosquito' (ERG). This
 set of facts is evidence of some specialization of the reduction process by suffix type,
 seemingly not very far advanced, however, in the context of general variability in final
 syllable reduction.
   The two common nouns of this sub-type mentioned above show different tendencies.
Mayin 'vegetable food' tends to exhibit inflecting stem mayi-, i.e., with reduction of -n
only. DAT mayi-wu, 'having' mayi-warang, etc. However, both accepted and used is the
 unreduced stem mayin, e.g., DAT mayin- gu. This seems to be of higher frequency with
 Dissociative and Source suffixes, mayin-gunya, mayin-gunba, seemingly an indication
of the overall somewhat more clitic-like morpho-syntactic status of these case-endings
compared to the elementary or non-composite cases (see Chapter 5). On the other hand,
layin exhibits with about equal frequency the Dative forms layi-wu and lany-gu. In other
cases the latter appears to be most common, e.g., ABL lany-ba. (There is no
corresponding stem *many- for mayin). Informants found the Ergative form *layi-yi
unusual/unacceptable, both layin-yi and lany-nyi common and acceptable. Instances of
the latter noun in Ergative case are not infrequent, especially since layin clearly can have
the general sense 'game animal'. This appears to be linked to the fact that, in that sense
(as distinct from the sense ""game meat""), the word is often found in construction with a
specific term designating a kind of animal, e.g., layin gangman 'kangaroo (game)' (see
 10.5.). Thus, specific animal terms commonly exhibited Ergative marking, and so may
layin, which as illustrated has at least in part a kind of classifier-like occurrence and
identificational textual function: ngamanda-yi lany-nyi yimbu-larri 'what kind of
[ngamanda, 'what', ERG] animal bit you?'
   There is, again, considerable variability among the nominals grouped under the
sub-type -Sin, but some generalizations do emerge from the variability. For nominals
ending in -bin, there were two common patterns: reduction of -in, or failure to reduce
where reduction would leave a stem-final cluster (e.g., ABS lalbin 'narrow place', LOG
wu-lalbi-ya 'in the crack'; ABS 'greedy (person)' wujbin, ERG wujbin-yi, PL ABS
wujbin-mulu. For nominals with apical stop (a, rd) as final syllable margin, the most
common pattern (for all kinds of non-zero endings) was again reduction of-in. Examples
are: ABS madin 'language, word', DAT mad-gu, ADV mad-barra; ABS minyardin
'charcoal', LOG minyard-ja; ABS jordjordin 'crazy, mad', PL ABS yi-jordjord-mulu
'mad ones'; ABS yordin 'ashes', DAT yord-gu. It seems, however, that words with
homorganic apical nasal-stop cluster across the syllable margin ought not be included in
this subtype, because they appear to commonly lose only -n, or alternatively fail to
                                                                          Process phonology 31reduce. An example is ABS barndin 'sore', DAT barndi-wii, 'having' forms
barndi-warang, barndin-garang. Consideration of nominals with final -gin shows that
the presence of homorganic nasal-stop cluster is relevant to the form of reduction there
too.
    Nominals ending in -jin seem also to preferentially lose -in, thus clustering with
nominals ending in -b/d/rdin. Examples are ABS wu-jerrijin 'cold weather', ADV
wiijerrij-barra; ABS berngijin 'black soil', LOC berngij-a, ABL berngij-ba etc.
 (' Black soil' and a few other nouns are sometimes treated as collectives, and have special
number- marked stems, see 5.6.3.)
    Nominals ending in -gin also preferentially lose -in, except where this would leave a
stem-final cluster. Where the latter would occur, trisyllabic (or longer) stems with/igg
across syllable margin may reduce the entire final syllable to zero, adding endings directly
to the remaining ng. Examples of the first sort are ABS nniragin ' shade', LOCnnirag-ja;
belgin 'mud', LOC belg-ja; ABS yi-goyogin 'salt water', ALLyi-gayog-arr, LOC
yi-goyog-ja; nvirrgbarrgin 'cramp', ERG njarrgbarrg-ji; ABS larrglarrgin 'light (not
dense) shade', LOC wu-larrglarrg-ja; ABS dulgin' urine', OATdulg-ii'; ABS wii-nurlgin
'hot ashes, live coals', LOC wu-nurlg-ja.
    Despite the relative acceptability of forms such as belg-ja here, that there is some issue
of remaining stem-final clusters is shows by the fact that, while both belg-ja and
belgin-nya 'in the mud' were considered usual and acceptable (and the former is in fact
more frequent), informants refused to accept warlg-ja 'in bed, in the swag', and instead
allowed only warlgin-nya.
    Four nominals in which zeroing of the entire final syllable seems to account for the
usual inflecting stem-form areluyunggin 'smoke', guyanggin 'woomera', warranggin
' corroboree', and balanggin ' new'. Most common case-forms for the former were, e.g.,
ABLluyimg-ba, ALLluyimg-garr; for 'woomera', UOCguyang-nya, ABLgnyang-ba;
for 'corroboree', DAT warrang-git. Alternative forms for all these nominals were
unreduced As noted far above, the noun banggin' back' was never found to reduce (thus,
*bang-nya LOC, was unacceptable). The factor relevant to failure to reduce is evidently
presence of the homorganic nasal-stop cluster, in a bisyllabic stem where such reduction
would remove the homorganic stop. Commonest patterns for different final-syllable
types may be summarized:
     -CVn (where Fis not ι)                     reduce -n
     -Cin
            -M/i                                reduce -in
            -L/RFfin                            reduce -in, also -n
            -Sin (S =stop)                      reduce -in
                    -gin                        as above but may zero syllable where
                                                 preceding segment is ng in trisyllabic
                                                 stems
  At least one word, bornorron 'brolga', which undergoes reduction bornorro-yi ERG,
compares with bornorrong (velar nasal - final) in some other languages of the region,
e.g., Jawoyn, Ngalkbon.
32 Chapters3.5. Fortition and related processesWardaman exhibits surface alternations, some of which must be considered to result from
fortition, or ""hardening"", a process by which a basic sonorant is realized as a stop. There
are several distinguishable, productive processes of this sort; that is, which are
environmentally conditioned, live alternations. An expository problem is that certain of
these, with which this section begins, are closely linked to other processes which operate
at the same boundary — that between pronominal prefix and verb stem — but have
different effects (degemination, deletion, etc.). There are other important fortition
processes of quite different character, which operate elsewhere. My preference is to treat
together the set of processes which operate at boundary between prefix and verb stem,
rather than artificially attempting to group all fortition processes together.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56]"
"7.6.6. Adverbial ending -minAn adverbial final suffix -min may be added to a number of different parts of speech,
often with little isolable contribution to meaning. The suffix sometimes may be glossed
""in the direction of, ""in the manner of, or ""up until"". It is frozen lexically in a number
of forms including the numeral guyamin 'two', the adverb jangbuwarrmin 'in vain, for
nothing', and apparently the demonstrative damin 'here' (see 7.2.). As noted in 7.6.5.,
the form legegumin means 'sporadically, once in a while, now and again, sometimes'.(353)    legegumin     yi-bam-nya        nga-ga-ndi

   As some of the examples show, -nvn often seems to have a liminal component of
meaning' right up to' whatever is designated by the nominal, particle, or adverb to which
it is suffixed Conceivably this suffix is relatable to the verbal suffix -nun in Wakiman,
which Cook (1987: 184) glosses 'progressive aspect'.","[192, 193]"

       Clausal particles, conjunctions, and interjections
12.1. Introduction
In this chapter are drawn together several functionally diverse categories of elements,
most of them categorizable as ""particles"" in having independent word status, and not
inflecting. However, some of the forms discussed in this chapter are clitics, and others
(like marrig, 12.2.1.) are clitic-like in usually occupying a determinate position
(following the first full word) of the clause. Beyond that, the forms are divisible into at
least three functional sets, with a degree of overlap between any two, in that some forms
may be assigned to more than one set.
  The first set, called ""clausal particles"", function to subcategorize the predicate in terms
of modal semantics, and occur in construction with the entire clause. To an extent, some
of these clausal particles tend to occur with certain tense-aspect-mood inflectional forms
of the verb (as gala 'try' often occurs with future), but most are not as clearly restricted
in this way. One, bujun 'if etc., occurs frequently in the construction of conditional
clauses, but this is not its sole function. Other members of this set, such as yilama 'might
be' freely occur with a range of different verb forms, and generally introduce a meaning
of speaker speculation or hypothesis ""I suppose"" etc.
  The second set, ""conjunctions"", generally function to specify ""the way in which what
is to follow is systematically connected to what has gone before"" (Halliday and Hasan
1976: 227). Several different semantic sub-types of conjunctive relations are
distinguished.
  The third set, ""interjections"", are forms which constitute a complete utterance by
themselves. However, while they may do so formally, interjections are of course also
cohesive, and express comment partly on elements of the communicative situation, rather
than simply upon its prepositional content. To the extent that they do the former, they
are conjunctive in the general sense given above. We find therefore that one of the major
conjunctions, ngala 'but, however', also occurs as interjection.
  There is a small set of forms (two independent words, and one clitic) that combine
text-cohesive and interjectional properties in a way that does not lend itself to neat
labelling or classification; these are discussed as a sub-class of (most explicitly)
""interpersonal elements"", a label not intended to suggest that other formal classes and
elements do not have an interpersonal dimension.","[314, 315]"
"5.6.2. Dual suffix -guya ~ -wuyaThe dual suffix -guya - -wuya is ""chameleon"" in that, although it marks a category of
the noun, it is freely affixed to either nominal or verb (or both within the clause), to
express the notion of a set of two. Examples in which the dual suffix has occurred on
nominal or on each member of a nominal phrase in this chapter are (3, 30, 90, and 120).
In (123) there was an example of dual suffixed to a verb. Further examples of that kind
are:(126) ya-wurr-nge-yi-n                      wirrig               ya-wurr-bu-yinggan-guya
      3-3NSG-argue MED-PRES                 tomorrow            3-3NSG-fight RR POT-DU
       'They are arguing, tomorrow they may fight'.
90 Chapters(127) ngayi-ga-n-guya
      UNDU-take-PRES-DU
        'Let's you and I take it'.(128) bambaya            ya-wu-da-yi-n-guya
      row                3-3NSG-AUX-RR-PRES-DU
       'They are rowing [arguing] together'.
  There is no distinction in verbal pronominals between dual and plural categories in
second and third persons (see Chapter 6): those forms in the verb may be designated
simply ""non-singular"". Thus the dual suffix, whether suffixed to nominal or verb or both,
often functions within the clause to explicitly mark dual reference (e.g., example 126 and
127 above). Dual suffixed to a nominal expresses that there is a pair of a single kind
(e.g., dang-guya yarrula-wuya 'these two young people, this young couple'). However,
dual is often suffixed to the second of two overtly expressed nominals, to more explicitly
formulate the two thus explicitly mentioned as a pair. Examples are:(129) ngayugu           yinggangala-wuya            ngayi-jingi-n
      1SGABS            [ss]-DU-ABS                 UNDU-sit-PRES
       'Yinggangala [subsection term] and I are sitting down',(130) yibiyan           yi-ngawuyu-wuya             ya-wud-janga-n
      man-AB S          YI-wife-DU-ABS              3-3NSG-come-PRES
       'The [pair of them] man and his wife are coming'.
  Any overt case suffixes follow the number marker, e.g. yibiyan-guya-yi 'the two men',
ERG.
  A derived or morphologically secondary adverb waliguya 'all around, in all directions'
may be analyzed as the combination of adverb walig 'around', and dual suffix, so that
the pair concept provides the formal and semantic basis for a notion of entirety.
  A special dyadic suffix is used with kinship terms; see 5.11.","[113, 114]"
"11.1.2. Particle suffix -ba ~ -maThe particle suffix may be freely added to members of this word class which otherwise
end in a consonant, e.g., ban.garrg or ban.garrg-ba 'fall, pitch down, headlong',
bulmarrab or bulmarrab-(b)a 'float', lorn 'peel, strip' and lorn-ma, etc. It may also be
264 Chapter 11
suffixed to some members of the class here called adverbs, e.g., bone and borle-ma
 'across', malang and malang-ma 'cross, across', etc.
   There is a no doubt etymologically related suffix -ma in Wakiman, which Cook
(1987: 235) describes as implementing aspectual differences in the particle class (or
""participles"", as he terms them). In fact, there he recognizes four aspectual participial
forms: aspectually ""unmarked"" (with suffix -ma for many members of the class);
Punctual, reduced in some way compared to the ""unmarked"" form, and involving zeroing
of-ma for some participles; Sequential with suffix -wi; and Purposive, which is generally
built on the ""unmarked"" stem form by addition of y-gu. Cook (1987: 232) notes that
participles in Wakiman can occur alone without nominal arguments as imperative
utterances, and it would seem (ibid: 255) that such imperative function generally (or
invariably?) involves use of the aspectually ""Punctual"" forms, and not the ""unmarked""
ones.
   In contrast, in Wardaman although the alternation between zero-suffixed and -ba ~ -ma
suffixed particles is ubiquitous, no such clear aspectual difference can be discerned in
the alternation, and indeed no perspicuous grammatical distinction can be associated with
it. One piece of evidence of the difference between Wakiman and Wardaman comes from
the fact that the overtly suffixed particles are freely used in imperative constructions, as
the following examples show:(632)   \vird-ba         ga        yi-nebel-ya
        carry up-PS      AUX       YI-shoulder-LOC
        'Carry it on your shoulder!'.
  The locative phrase seems redundant, given that wird is usually understood to mean
'carry on shoulder' without additional qualification.(633)   gud-ba            me

  (639) illustrates the retention of the particle suffix in a negative imperative construction.
One might expect this to be less an issue in the negative imperative, because of the fact
that it is not formally distinct from the Irrealis Present.
  Elsewhere, in other tense-aspect-mood forms of the verb, the presence or absence of
the particle suffix equally seems not to be associable with a categorial difference. The
following are (elicited) examples of suffixed and suffix-less forms, alleged to be
interpreted in the same way:(638)    wonggo           worlog/worlog-ba              ya-0-bu-n                        gunga

 Although not all of the predicate meanings in these examples can be seen as aspectually
punctual, there are some that seem undoubtedly so, e.g., (642), and with respect to these
266 Chapter 11
informants seem to not make a distinction between the suffixed and unsuffixed particle
forms. This alternation extends also to members of the word class that are general enough
that they might equally be termed adverbs, viz.:(643) menbalu-wa      0-nyanga-ndi                   borle/borle-ma     dan-garr yimerrug

        'The spirit came across from Manbulloo to here'.
 Compare (644) and (645), both of which seem to designate actions of semantically
punctual aspect:(644)   wu-dab-(b)a         werr-ma         0-bu-ndi

        'She lay in wait for him with a knife, he came naked from the shower and the
        knife came out [from] his back'.
  In short, whatever the function of the alternation may have been historically, it seems
not to be associable with a difference between grammatical categories now. Any
supposed levelling of a previous grammatical difference may have to do with the wide
distribution of the -ba ~ -ma verb class in the contemporary lexicon, where the suffix is
re-interpreted as a mark of predicate function per se, and not of contrast within the system
of verbal categories.","[287, 288, 289, 290]"
"
8.6. FutureFuture is marked by the suffix -wa, which occurs in combination with initial (Indicative
non-past) prefix ya- in third person forms. As discussed above, for some verbs there is
a distinctive Future stem-form to which this suffix is added. Future stems have the
characteristic vocalism /, so for these verbs Future is marked by the suffix combination
-i-we.
  Future expresses the inevitability or necessity of future action. It is often appropriately
translated by the English modals ""must"" or ""have to"", and sometimes simply ""is going
180 Chaptersto""; and is also the tense-mood-aspect form of jussive complements, and complements
of promising (""saying that"" with Future time reference). In some of the examples below,
the values of Potential and Future can be contrasted.(378)   bujun    ngan-yani-we      gurru               nga-yana-yan      yinggi

  It may seem inconsistent with the semantic characterization of Future as given to have
an ""if clause with Future verb form, for the conjunction seems to specify the predicate
meaning as merely possible. Future, however, is the preferred form of the protasis of
non-past conditionals, seemingly another indication of the closer relationship of the
Future (compared, e.g., with the Potential) to irrealis semantically (and formally, an
historical indication of which has already been referred to, the sharing of Future stem by
Future tense forms and Irrealis zero-suffix forms for some verbs).(379) yawurr-(y)ingbe              wirrig

"11.3.1. Derivational suffix: -gujban ~ wujbanThe following two sub-sections briefly exemplify three adjectival derivatives possible
with both particles and finite verbs. With particles, the derivational suffixes are added
directly to the root, or to its particle-suffixed form without any additional mark of
derivation. However, with finite verbs, these suffixes are added to the nominalized form
in -yi-, that is, the usual one to which any overt case suffixes are added. The first suffix
was already described briefly in 9.1.4.: the generally agentive ending -gujban - -wujban.
                                            Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 273
This occurs, not only with particles and finite verbs, but to a more limited extent also
with nominal stems. In the latter case, the suffix is added to the final-syllable reduced
stem. Examples follow, first of such forms from finite verbs, second from particles, and
third from nominal stems, with nominal(ized) base form in the left-hand column and
derivative in the right.

274 Chapter 11  With respect to the finite verbs, note that before the nominalizing suffix -yi-, the vowel
of any final suffix -ba or -ma becomes i. In normal speech, the sequence -mi-yi- often
involves reduction of the semivowel, so the occurring form is more often [mi:] or [mi:I].
  With respect to the particles, in collected forms the particle suffix is present in slightly
more than half, but for those in which it occurred, alternative forms without suffix were
also considered normal usage.
  With respect to other forms, most of these are nominal stems, and indeed most
ordinarily argument nouns. The connotations of the term for ""sorcerer"" are that this is a
kind of person believed to fell victims and remove (kidney) fat from their bodies,
unknown to them, and thus to cause death within a matter of days. A sorcerer is thus
presumably someone who acts on fat, but no determinate grammatical function can be
assigned to ""fat"". Likewise, wiyan may mean 'water', but today also 'alcohol'; a
wiya-wujban is someone who constantly drinks. Yirlarlan means 'country, open country'
and thus yirlarla-wujban is someone who never stops moving around, someone always
on the move. Yinabam is 'cooked food' (as opposed to unprepared or raw foods), and
thus yinabam-gujban is a particularly opprobrious kind of person who comes around and
cadges cooked food at someone else's expense instead of preparing his or her own. It is
notable the extent to which this suffix is used to form common terms of abuse and opprobrium.
  The inflecting form of this suffix is gujba             wujba; thus, Ergative barrgbarrg-
(g)ujba-yi 'wife-stealer' (ERG.).
  It should be noted that in some cases there is minor difference between the base and
derived form semantically. For example, (yi-)jordjordin means 'mad' or 'crazy-acting'
person, (yi-)jordjord-gujban something very similar. But the suffix seems to place in
focus agency and activity, so that the latter gloss would probably be most appropriate for
the derived form. Also, certain particles, especially some expressing dispositions and
modes of acting, may be found to function as nominals without any mark of derivation.
Thus, from galyurra 'bother' is formed galyurra-wujban 'nuisance'; but note the
following two examples of nominal function of formally underived instances:(658)    galyurra-marla       0-marn-bu-yi-rri-ya
