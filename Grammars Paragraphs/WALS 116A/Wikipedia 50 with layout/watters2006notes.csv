–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––5.6.1.      Adverbs of manner
   Two adverbs of manner that are generic are based on ‘this’ and ‘that’ and combine
with the ‘make’ verb root to form pro-forms – ‘in this manner,’ and ‘in that manner’:
    (216)      a. ai ˙di           ‘doing like this’
               b. gin ˙di          ‘doing like that’
    Other adverbs of manner have to do with the relative speed in which an event occurs,
as in the following:
    (217)      a. m˙st˙m˙          ‘slowly’
               b. m˙la≥            ‘tardily’
               c. siba             ‘fast, quickly’
    Others adverbs refer to the associative aspect of the referents performing the action:
    (218)      a. myaqa            ‘alone’
               b. qa tse           ‘together’
     Still others adverbs of manner answer questions about an event’s level of certainty
or necessity, and if the event did not occur, about the margin of possibility by which it
failed to occur, as in:
    (219)      a. REALIS:
                  k˙pæera          ‘again’
               b. IRREALIS:
                  hunko            ‘almost’5.6.2.      Adverbs of time
   Adverbs of time are broader in scope that manner adverbs, and characterize entire
events, as in: Yesterday, Prem Bahadur went to the forest. In the following examples,
we list them in broad semantic domains, though it must be pointed out that the different
domains have no significance or relevance in grammatical terms:
    (220)      DAYS:
                   t˙ina, t˙ndin         ‘today’
                   goraq                 ‘tomorrow’
                   qoturaq               ‘day after tomorrow’
                   pyana, pene           ‘yesterday’
                   to on                 ‘day before yesterday’
    (221)      TIME WITHIN A DAY:
                   deosi                 ‘later today’
                   goradze               ‘morning, early’
                   isi, iskin            ‘evening’
                   oˆ ts˙                ‘afternoon’
    (222)      YEARS:
                   t˙inan b˙s˙           ‘this year’
                   oran b˙s˙             ‘next year’
                   pyai d˙g˙n b˙s˙       ‘last year’

    Adverbs of location specify the physical location of an event or of its participants, as
in: Kamala sat across from me. Locative suffixes also specify location or direction, as
in ‘in the tree’ or ‘to the house’ and were treated in §5.2.2.3. Those listed here are
locative postpositions. Locative postpositions were treated more generally in §5.3 as a
class of nouns – “relator nouns” – and will not be repeated here.
    We will add here two other adverbs – adverbs of relative distance – that are somewhat
different from physical location:
    (224)      a. h~utu                ‘far’
               b. ist˙                 ‘near’5.6.4.      Adverbs of quantity
    Following are examples of adverbs of quantity:

               b.   m˙nni              ‘many’
               c.   h~uku h~uku        ‘a little bit’
               d.   sw˙tt˙i            ‘all’
               e.   m˙ta, m˙           ‘only’
                                            84
6.        Basic clause types
    Basic clause types in Kusunda are 1) verbless equative constructions, 2) existential
and locative copular constructions, and 3) intransitive, transitive, and bitransitive construc-
tions. In §5.5 we have already noted several distinctions between transitive and intransitive
verbs, but in this section we will attempt to summarize and bring together all the salient
features that serve to define them.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"
"5.5.7.      Hortatives and optatives
    The “hortative” and “optative” in Kusunda specify similar semantic notions, differing
primarily in the person involved in the predication. The hortative is a kind of first
person imperative expressing notions like ‘Let’s go!’ whereas the optative is a kind of
third person imperative expressing a notion of ‘Let him go!’ or ‘May he go!’5.5.7.1.     Hortative
    Our understanding of the hortative in Kusunda is still tentative. Part of the problem
is due to a close similarity in form between hortatives and first person past forms. In
Class I verbs, i.e. those with prefixed person marking, there is generally a defective or
poorly developed past perfective marking (sometimes missing altogether). Recall from
examples like (163–165) that past marking is characterized by -d-i ‘first person,’ -n-i
‘second person,’ and -g-i ‘third person.’ In verbs without the past distinction (some of
the Class I verbs) there is only a realis–irrealis distinction. It is in precisely these cases
that -di marks hortative, not first person past.
    Thus, with a Class I verb like ‘eat,’ realis and irrealis forms occur predictably as
follows, paralleling the forms for ‘beat’:
    (207)      Class I - EAT       Class II - BEAT
               REALIS:
               a. t-˙m-˙n          pumba-d-ßn        ‘I eat.’ / ‘I beat.’
               b. t-˙m-da-n        pumba-d˙-n        ‘We eat.’ / ‘We beat.’
               c. n-˙m-˙n          pumba-n-ßn        ‘You eat.’ / ‘You beat.’                                              79

   (208)     IRREALIS:

             f.   g-˙m-da-k      pumba-g˙-k        ‘They will eat.’ / ‘They will beat.’
    In the past paradigm, however, Class I forms are defective – i.e. -di and -dei mark
singular and plural hortatives, not past tense:
   (209)     Class I - EAT       Class II - BEAT
             PAST:
             a. t-˙m-di          pumba-d-i         ‘Let me eat!’ / ‘I beat.’
             b. t-˙m-d˙i         pumba-d-˙i        ‘Let’s eat!’ / ‘We beat.’
             c.                  pumba-n-i         ‘You beat.’
             d.                  pumba-n-˙i        ‘You [pl] beat.’
             e.                  pumba-g-i         ‘He/she beats.’
             f.                  pumba-g-˙i        ‘They beat.’
    Forms -di and -d˙i (209a–b) mark the hortative in Class I, but past tense in Class II.
Furthermore, the forms expected in (209c–f) are generally missing from Class I, though
there appears to be some confusion on that count. Gyani Maiya and Kamala are in
disagreement on whether a form n-˙m-di is possible – Gyani Maiya says “yes” (as a
past tense); Kamala says “no”. The analogy between Class I hortative and Class II
past tense apparently confuses them. Though the forms n-˙m-di and g-˙m-di have a
familiar ring to them, they are unsure about their grammaticality and where to place
them.
    A question arises as to how the hortative is marked in Class II verbs. Unfortunately,
our notes are sketchy and inconsistent on this matter and we cannot give a definitive
answer. For some verbs we have homophonous forms for the hortative and first person
past:
   (210)     a.   a-d-i          ‘I made it.’ / ‘Let me make it!’
             b.   e-d-i          ‘I gave it.’ / ‘Let me give it!’
             c.   dzaÚ-d-i       ‘I bought it.’ / ‘Let me buy it!’
             d.   tsim˙-d-i      ‘I touched it.’ / ‘Let me touch it!’
   For other verbs we have the homophonous form plus a disambiguated form that
makes use of the Class I hortative form of the verb ‘get, go get, fetch’:
   (211)     a. pumba-di / -d-i
                beat-HORT / -1-PAST        ‘Let me beat it!’ / ‘I beat it.’
             b. pumba ts-i-di
                beat  1-get-HORT           ‘Let me (go/get) beat it!’
   The grammaticalization of a hortative from verbs like ‘come,’ ‘go,’ and ‘get’ is not
unusual and has been reported in numerous languages (see Aikhenvald forthcoming: on                                           80

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––Origins of imperatives). What is unusual is a formal similarity between past tense and
hortative. In the languages surrounding Kusunda, and following universal expectations,
the hortative has formal ties to future tense.","[79, 80, 81]"
"   • Negative indefinite pronouns. Negative indefinite pronouns are derived from the
more basic interrogative pronouns seen in the preceding section. The “nobody, nothing,
nowhere” series, for example, uses the interrogative pronoun plus an existential negative.
The pattern is pervasive in South Asia and often appears with an emphatic marker on the
question word as well, as in IA Nepali ke-hi chhaina [what-EMP is.not] ‘nothing,’ or TB
Kham su-z˙ male [who- EMP is.not] ‘no one.’ Though it occurs without an emphatic in
Kusunda, its basic form is the same, as the following examples show:
    (104)      a. n˙tßn kæaÚ u tsim˙n-gya
                  what not        touch-OPT
                  ‘Nothing will happen, let him touch it!’
               b. n˙tßn qæaiya kæaÚ u
                  what danger not
                  ‘There is no danger.’

                  where not
                  ‘nowhere’        The finals -ti and -ßn may be old classifier morphemes and occur in other sequences like qas-ti
    19‘one’ and qas-ßn ‘one’.",[48]

                 Table 1. CONSONANT INVENTORY IN KUSUNDA4.4.1.     The labial series
    The labial series in Kusunda is fairly simple and straightforward. There are five
sounds to which we have accorded phonological status – [p], [pæ], [b], [bæ], and [m]
(plus the semivowel [w]).
    However, many of the allophonic problems that occur elsewhere in the phonology
also occur in the labial series, and we will do well to deal with them here. One problem
has to do with voicing, another with aspiration, and still another with fricativization.
Though there is a clear voicing contrast word initially, the contrast is sometimes neutralized
intervocalically (especially in rapid speech and if the syllable in question is unstressed),
as in the following examples:
    (37)    CONTRAST (p- vs. b-):
            a. [pitadi]             ‘I untied it.’
            b. [bi itßn]            ‘It dawned.’
    (38)    NEUTRALIZATION:
            a. [tap]                ‘chicken’
            b. [tab-i gwa]          ‘chicken egg’
    Neutralization does not occur if the preceding sound is a consonant, even if it is a
voiced consonant, as in:
    (39)    a. [amba]               ‘meat’
            b. [hampe]              ‘where’
                                              32

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––4.4.1.1.   Bilabial fricatives
   Voiced labial consonants often undergo fricativization when occurring between vowels.
The fricative variants do not have phonemic status. Following are examples:
    (40)   FRICATIVIZATION:
           a. [d˙∏˙ i]             ‘later today’
           b. [yi∏iu]              ‘scratch’
    A question arises with respect to polysyllabic morphemes in which a voiced bilabial
stop occurs intervocalically in some words and a voiced fricative in others, as in:
    (41)   a. [sabe]               ‘there’
           b. [ i∏a]               ‘quickly’
    Without the information in (40) or in (41b), conventional wisdom would recommend
that we write [sabe] as /sabe/. If, however, we can show that underlying /p/ surfaces as
[b] intervocalically and underlying /b/ surfaces as [∏], we would be supported in repre-
senting (41a) ‘there’ as /sape/ and (41b) ‘quickly’ as /siba/. We suspect, in fact, that
this is what is happening, but we do not yet have sufficient evidence to support our
hypothesis.
    There is a possibility too that some intervocalic sequences that we have represented
as /w/, may, in fact, turn out to be [∏], (i.e. underlying /b/), as in: [d˙∏˙ i] ~ [d˙o i]
‘later.’4.4.1.2.   Bilabial aspirates
    Aspiration has marginal status in Kusunda, and may very well be a novel innovation,
due to areal influence from Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman. We have 13 instances of
[pæ] in our wordlist, but some appear to be partial borrowings. The word [k˙pæera]
‘again,’ for example, resembles Nepali [pæeri]; [pæ˙laq] ‘bed’ resembles Nepali [pæ˙le]
‘plank’; [pæurpæur] ‘run’ resembles Tibeto-Burman (TB) *pur ‘fly’ (which is aspirated
in Chepang, Magar, and some Kham dialects); and [pæela≥] ‘flat’ resembles TB *ple≥
‘flat.’ It is unnecessary to trace the two TB loans back to PTB; there are cognate forms
closer at hand, found in Kham, Magar, and Chepang.
    Words with aspirate [pæ] that appear to have a native origin are the following:
    (42)   a.   pæo-                 ‘shoot a gun’
           b.   pæepßn               ‘drop’
           c.   pæirutßn             ‘full’
           d.   pæotoq               ‘short’
           e.   pæurlu≥              ‘red’
           f.   pæuÚdzi              ‘jump’
           g.   pæya-                ‘wash clothes’
           h.   pæyaks˙m             ‘horse’
    We have two instances of [bæ], one of which appears to have a Nepali source:
    (43)   a. bæ˙raqßn               ‘break (rope)’
           b. bæ˙~îra                ‘sparrow’ < Nep. bæ˙≥ero

    The apical consonants are those articulated with the apex (or tip) of the tongue, and
the series is rife with phonological variants. In terms of raw phonetic values, sounds in
the apical series occur at several non-contrastive points of articulation – dental, alveolar,
retroflex, and some palatal variants. Here again, it is the active articulator that is contrastive.","[31, 32, 33, 34]"

occur closer to the verb than the pronominal referent. This is the least marked order:

                 I   yesterday 1-go-REAL
                 ‘I went yesterday.’
              b. tsi da≥      t -a -an
                 I Dang 1-go-IRR
                 ‘I will go to Dang.’
              c. gina    tok-ma    u-g-i
                 he/she us-WITH come-3-PAST
                 ‘He/she came with us.’
    Where both peripheral elements occur – time and location – the element with closer
semantic ties to the verb occurs next to the verb, and the other element occurs as an
adverbial specification to the whole predication. This order mirrors the basic order for
transitive predications too – the object occurs next to the verb, and temporal elements
which occur outside the case frame also occur syntactically outside:
    (258)     a. INTRANSITIVE:
                 goraq       tsi da≥       t -a -an
                 tomorrow    I     Dang 1-go-IRR
                 ‘Tomorrow I will go to Dang.’
              b. TRANSITIVE:
                 pyana       tsi agai-da pumba-d-i
                 yesterday I      dog-ACC beat-1-PAST
                 ‘Yesterday I beat the dog.’    • Case marking. Case marking in Kusunda follows a basic nominative–accusative
alignment – S and A arguments are unmarked (nominative) and the O argument is
marked by the accusative suffix -da (see example (258b)). For more details and
examples, see §5.2.2.2.
    There are a few transitive verbs in Kusunda which appear to be “less-than-transitive”
– they have some of the morphosyntactic characteristics of intransitive verbs. ‘Climb,’
‘beg,’ and ‘fight,’ for example, all take intransitive imperative markers. All happen to be
non-accusative in case marking; that is, the notional object is marked by a locative ‘on’
for ‘climb’ and a comitative ‘with’ for ‘beg’ and ‘fight’. (See the discussion following
example (196).)
                                              96
7.       Transitivity alternations – causatives, anti-
         causatives, and reflexives
    There are a number of derivational operations by which intransitive verbs can be
made transitive, and transitive verbs made intransitive. We will deal here only with
morphological operations, leaving periphrastic causatives and other syntactic devices to
§9.2.","[95, 96, 97]"
"4.4.5.     Liquids, flaps, glides, etc.
   Kusunda has the liquid [l], the flap [r], and glides [y] and [w]. Following are
examples:
    (83)     LIQUID:
             a.   la an          ‘village’
             b.   ligin          ‘nettle, burlap’
             c.   balßn          ‘descend’
             d.   dz˙g˙l         ‘old woman’
    (84)     FLAP:
             a.   r˙ktsa         ‘Chettri’

             d.   k~aw˙r         ‘light weight’
    Glides (semi-vowels) occur as non-peak elements in vocalic sequences belonging to
the same syllable, as in:
    (85)     GLIDES:
             a.   ye≥gu          ‘stone’

5.         Word classes
     The major word classes, noun, verb, and adjective are well represented in Kusunda.
We will deal with them one at a time in this section with a separate sub-section for
pronouns. We will also look at some minor word classes, like adverbs, numerals, and
question words. We were unable to determine the extent to which Kusunda makes use
of “ideophones” or “rhyming couplets” for modifying verbs. This is a category of
the type in which basic verbs like ‘go’ are modified by ideophonic adverbs to mean
things like ‘saunter,’ ‘stomp away,’ ‘go in long strides,’ etc. The phonomenon is well
represented in the region, both in Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman languages. The
category needs study in Kusunda; indeed, it has not yet been determined if it exists at
all.","[43, 44]"
"5.1.1.1.    Possessive prefixes
    In first and second persons singular, the same pronominal roots (tsi- and ni-) can
occur as pronominal prefixes on nouns, without the genitive. Where they do, they are
possessive prefixes, and differ from the possessive pronouns shown in (90) in much the
same way that ‘mine’ differs from ‘my’ in English. The “alienable–inalienable”
distinction found in some languages appears to be irrelevant for Kusunda. Following
are examples:
    (91)    a. tsi-gimi
               1SPOSS-money                ‘my money’
            b. ni-gimi
                 2SPOSS-money              ‘your money’                                                45
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    In first and second persons plural, the possessive root cannot occur as a possessive
prefix attached directly to nouns, but must be accompanied by the genitive. This is true
also for third person gina, as in:
    (92)    a. *tig-gimi
            b. tig-i       gimi
                1PPOSS-GEN money          ‘our money’
    (93)    a. *gina-gimi
            b. gina-yi gimi
               he-GEN money               ‘his money’
    First or second person singular possession can be marked by either form – the
prefixal form or the genitive marked form – though there are likely pragmatic differences
between the two. The following examples show them in free variation:
    (94)    a. tsi-gimi ~ tsi-yi gimi         ‘my money’
            b. ni-gimi ~ ni-yi gimi           ‘your money’
    The genitive occurs also on question words, as in:
    (95)        n˙ti-ye      gimi
                who-GEN      money            ‘whose money?’5.1.1.2.   Lexicalized third person possession
    There are several lexical items in the language in which an initial g- is very likely the
vestige of an old third person possessive prefix. Typically, such words come from the
domain of body parts (and may be restricted to a general “parts” domain). Thus, for
example, the default word for ‘stomach’ is gim˙t and the second person possessed
form, ‘your stomach,’ is ni-gim˙t. From this we might expect tsi-gim˙t for ‘my stomach,’
which, indeed is possible, but the preferred form is ts-im˙t.
    (96)    a. gim˙t            ‘stomach’
            b. ni-gim˙t         ‘your stomach’
            c. ts-im˙t          ‘my stomach’
    Interestingly, in Reinhard’s 1976 list, ‘stomach’ is listed as imat, without a prefix.
In contrast, ‘knee’ in Reinhard’s list is t-uputu with a prefix (likely meaning ‘my
knee’), while we have elicited upto.
    The word for ‘wind’ is qai, while the word for ‘breath’ is either ata qai ‘mouth
wind,’ or ge-qai ‘its wind.’
    (97)    a. qai                      ‘wind’
            b. ata qai                  ‘breath’ (lit. ‘mouth wind’)
            c. ge-qai, [gya-qai]        ‘breath’ (lit. ‘its wind’)
    A word that commonly occurs in combination with other words to mean something
like ‘fluid’ or ‘juice,’ is very likely the etymon for ‘water’ with a lexicalized third
person prefix, as in the following:
    (98)    a. ta≥                    ‘water’
            b. gida≥                  ‘sap’ (lit. ‘its water’)
            c. ata gida≥              ‘saliva’ (lit. ‘mouth water’)                                             46

    Other candidates for a lexicalized third person prefix are the following:

             b.   gidza≥                 ‘body’

   First and second person pronouns have an oblique form that occurs with the accusative,
and third person has a slightly reduced form. Thus, taken together with the genitive
form, Kusunda has two “oblique” modifications of the pronoun, one for the genitive
and another for the accusative, as summarized in Table 2:

                    Table 2. OBLIQUE PRONOMINAL FORMS IN KUSUNDA5.1.3.      Interrogative pronouns
   The interrogative pronouns of Kusunda correspond to the so-called WH-words of
English and include the following seven:
    (100)      a.    n˙ti                  ‘who, what’
               b.    n˙n                   ‘what, why’
               c.    n˙tßn                 ‘what, why’
               d.    hampe                 ‘where’
               e.    ˙sa                   ‘how’
               f.    ˙si                   ‘how much’
               g.    ˙saÚ i                ‘when’
    The semantic domain of some of these interrogatives is not yet clear. ‘What,’ for
example, can be expressed by n˙ti, n˙n, or n˙tßn, all obviously related forms, but it is not
clear what their semantic differences are.1 9 Used with an animate demonstrative, n˙ti is    17
        The basic form for this word is mihaq ~ mehaq, and it is not clear to us what the function of
the prefix ge- might be.
        B. K. Rana (2002) claims similarity between this word and the Kham word ge-pa≥ ‘our
    18language.’ Granted, p˙n and pa≥ bear some similarity, the initial element in Kham is a first person
plural prefix, while in Kusunda it is a third person singular.","[45, 46, 47]"
"    • Optative in Class II verbs. The most regular optative forms are those for Class II
transitive verbs, i.e. those patterned after the verb ‘to do, make.’ Recall that such verbs
were also very regular in the imperative, empoying the suffix ˙-go ‘Do it!’ / ‘Make it!’
(see examples in (198)). Here the suffix empoyed is -˙ge, fashioned after the optative
form of ‘do’: ˙-ge ‘May he do it!’ Following are examples:
    (214)                               IMPERATIVE                    OPTATIVE

              d.   ‘buy’                dzaÚ ˙go                      dzaÚ ˙ge

    There is some confusion about another optative form -gya that occurs on the verb
‘to be, to become,’ as in: ˙-gya ‘Let it be!’ The form occurs erratically on other
intransitive verbs as well, which might suggest that this is an intransitive form. Among
them are lim-gya ‘Let him dance!’; b˙l-gya ‘Let him descend!’; sip-gya ‘Let him
enter!’; and dziu-gya ‘Let it leak!’ Significantly, however, the form occurs just as
frequently on transitive verbs, as in kis˙-gya ‘Let him cut it!’; and tsim˙n-gya ‘Let him
touch it!.’ Are we dealing here with a transcription error, with ˙gya being the same form
as ˙ge? Probably not.
    Interestingly, the form, wherever it occurs, is almost always transcribed without the
intervening schwa: -gya, but not ˙-gya. Given further that the optative form of the verb
‘to go’ is g-ya, with g- being separable as a third person prefix (which, as we saw
earlier, occurs in the optative form of all Class I verbs; see (212)), it is probable that we
are looking at a grammaticalized verb ‘go’ tacked on as a suffix as in: hui-gya ‘Let it
go fly!’; m˙b˙-gya ‘Let him go hear!’3 0 (We also saw in (211b) that ‘go/get’ is used
as a basis for some hortative constructions.)
    Assuming that our analysis is correct, and that -gya is a ‘go’ optative, we are left
with a residue of intransitive verbs that form the optative with the suffix -ta (allomorphs
-da and -na), or -ya. This is analogous to the intransitive imperative formed by the
suffix -to (allomorphs -do and -no in the same environments as optative -da and -na)
and fits our analysis well. Following are examples:

    There are several heterogeneous classes of words traditionally called adverbs that
have in common that they modify events or states (i.e. verbs or adjectives). The more
traditional ones are relatable to question words like ‘how,’ ‘where,’ ‘when,’ and ‘how
many’ as adverbs of ‘manner,’ ‘place,’ ‘time,’ and ‘quantity’ respectively, and will be
organized as such here.","[81, 82]"
"6.1.2.1      Existence
    It is important to distinguish in Kusunda the difference between “existence in a
location” and “location.” The former expresses that something exists in a given
location, like ‘In the tree is a monkey,’ whereas the latter focuses on the actual location
of a given referent, as in ‘The monkey is in the tree.’ The existential copula is used
primarily to express the former – existence in a location. Pure existence, as in any
language, is rare in Kusunda:
    (231)      a. tsi-˙i      tsu
                  my-father exist
                  ‘My father is’ / ‘My father is living’ / ‘I have a father.’
               b. wu     tsi-˙i       tsu
                  home my-father exist
                  ‘My father is (at) home.’
               c. yi-g˙ ha o           tsu
                  tree-IN monkey exist
                  ‘In the tree is a monkey’ / ‘There is a monkey in the tree.’
               d. tu       dukæu tsu
                  snake two        exist
                  ‘There are two snakes.’
                  (tsi would mean ‘Two snakes are there’ / ‘There are two snakes there’)6.1.2.2      Negative existential
    The negative existential is kæaÚu. We noted earlier (see the discussion following
example (74) and §5.5.4.1) that the actual negative sequence is -aÚu, with pharyngealization
on the first vowel and falling-rising pitch on the full sequence. This suggests that the
original negative sequence is something like -a)u, with kh-a)u as the negative existential.
This leaves kh- as the negative existential verb root, a suppletive form with no apparent
relationship to tsu. Following are examples:
    (232)      a. ta≥     tsu
                  water exist
                  ‘There is water.’
               a. ta≥     kæ-aÚ u           < kæ-a     u
                  water neg.exist-not
                  ‘There is no water.’

                my-small three exist
                ‘I have three children.’ (lit. ‘my little ones three exist’)
             b. nu-ma     ˙si         tsu?
                you-WITH how.many exist
                ‘How many do you have?’ (lit. ‘with you how many exist?’)
             c. tsi-ma    qasti tsu
                I-WITH one exist
                ‘I have one.’ (lit. ‘with me one exists’)
    Negative possession uses the same negative existential verb that we saw earlier –
kæaÚu. Following is an example:
   (234)     tsi-h~ukui qasti b˙        kæaÚ u
             my-little   one even is.not
             ‘I don’t have even one child.’6.1.2.4    Dative subject constructions
    In “dative subject constructions” feelings/emotions/pain are construed as existing
‘to’ a referent, as in ‘Hunger is to me.’ In terms of syntax, the construction is similar to
the possessive clause construction, the major difference being in the marking of the
topical argument – ‘with me’ in possessive clauses, and ‘to me’ in dative clauses.
   (235)     t˙n-da    ida≥         tsu
             me-DAT hunger exist
             ‘I am hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is to me’)
   The negative uses the same existential negative kæaÚu that we saw earlier:
   (236)     t˙n-da     ida≥        kæaÚ u
             me-DAT hunger is.not
             ‘I am not hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is not to me’)6.1.2.5    Predicate adjective
    The “predicate adjective” construction – ‘He is tall,’ ‘I am big,’ etc. – predicates
adjectival notions through the help of the existential copula tsu, as in:
   (237)     a. na pæurlu≥ tsu
                this red       is
                ‘This is red.’
             b. tsi-h~ukui li≥wa tsu
                my-small heavy is
                ‘My child is heavy.’                                            88

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    The negative uses the same existential negative kæaÚu we saw earlier:
               c. tsi-h~ukui li≥wa kæaÚ u
                  my-small heavy is.not
                  ‘My child is not heavy.’
               d. ben amba ola≥ kæaÚ u
                  raw meat tasty is.not
                  ‘Raw meat is not tasty.’
   The predicate adjective construction is also used to predicate attributes designated by
“participles” (here partially-finite adnominals), as in the following:
    (238)      a. suta    bæ˙ra-q-ßn      tsu
                  string break-AC-REAL is
                  ‘The string is broken.’
               b. k˙re k˙la-q-ßn           lan tsu
                  pot break-AC-REAL like is
                  ‘The pot is about to break.’ (lit. ‘is like it will break’)
    As shown in (228a), the adjective can occur also without the copula, in which case it
is interpreted as a nominal in an equative clause – ‘I am a small person.’ (See also
(230).)6.1.3       Locational copula
    The locational copula is used to predicate the location of a referent – it is in such and
such a place. It differs from the existential copula, in that the latter expresses that the
referent exists, whether explicitly in a place or not.
    The locational copula is tsi in the positive and kæaÚi in the negative. Recall that the
negative existential was kæaÚu. Contrasting kæaÚu with kæaÚi we have further evidence
that the sequences were originally tri-morphemic – kæ-a)-u versus kæ-a)-i. Following
are examples:
    (239)      POSITIVE:
               a. tsi tsi
                  I loc.copula                      ‘I am (here).’
               b. tsi t˙isa     tsi
                  I here        loc.copula          ‘I am here.’
               c. nu tsi?
                  you loc.copula                    ‘Are you (there)?’
               d. nu isna         tsi?
                  you there       loc.copula        ‘Are you there?’
    (240)      NEGATIVE:
               a. ha o     yi-g˙         kæaÚ i
                  monkey tree-LOC loc.neg
                  ‘The monkey is not (located) in the tree.’
                                               89
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Basic clause types
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––               b. gina     kæaÚ i
                  he/she loc.neg
                  ‘He is not (there).’
    Notice that sentences (239a) and (239b) are very nearly synonymous, as are (239c)
and (239d). What is implied in sentence (a) and (c) is made explicit by a locative adverb
in (b) and (d). Notice, too, how this copula contrasts with the existential copula.
Following are contrastive examples:
    (241)      a. EXISTENTIAL:
                  yi-g˙       ha o      tsu
                  tree-LOC monkey exist
                  ‘In the tree is a monkey.’ / ‘There is a monkey in the tree.’
               b. LOCATIONAL:
                  ha o    yi-g˙       tsi
                  monkey tree-LOC loc.copula
                  ‘The monkey is in the tree.’
    In §5.2.2.4, example (124), we saw that in possessive clauses marked by the comitative
-ma ‘with,’ both existential and locational locatives can be used felicitously. Where the
existential is used the assertion is concerned with the existence of the item; where the
locational is used the assertion is concerned with the location of the item:
    (242)      a. EXISTENTIAL POSSESSIVE:
                  tsi-ma gimi     tsu
                  I-WITH money exist
                  ‘I have some money on me.’ (lit. ‘money exists with me.’)
               b. LOCATIONAL POSSESSIVE:
                  tsi-ma gimi      tsi
                  I-WITH money loc.copula
                  ‘I have money.’ (lit. ‘money is located with me.’)6.1.4       The inchoative and the causative
    The inchoative and the causative are treated here as subtypes of copular constructions
because 1) they serve frequently as verbs in “light verb” constructions (i.e. where the
real predication is done by a nominal and the verb is semantically empty), 2) they have
an intransitive–transitive paradigmatic relationship to one another, and 3) they form the
basis for verbal conjugation in “non-inflecting verbs” (see §5.5.1.2). Following are
some light verb constructions, all transitive, and all of which utilize the verb ‘to do,’ as in
the following:
    (243)      a. p˙idzi bun˙       ˙-g-˙n
                  cloth    weave do-3-REAL
                  ‘She is weaving cloth.’ (lit. ‘does weaving’)
               b. tap       gimi     gwa ˙-g-˙n
                  chicken female egg do-3-REAL
                  ‘The hen layed an egg.’ (lit. ‘did an egg’)                                               90

                I drum         do-1-PAST
                ‘I beat the drum.’
    There is some question about whether there is a phonological distinction between the
inchoative ‘become’ and the causative ‘make.’ Under careful articulation we recorded
distinct paradigms, but on the following day our informants would often give either
interpretation for either paradigm. There may be a single ambi-transitive verb with the
interpretation based on pragmatics. It is difficult to say at this stage. Nevertheless, we
give here two separate paradigms:
   (244)     INCHOATIVE (‘become’)               CAUSATIVE (‘make’)
             a. PAST:

                3p                                  3p ˙-g˙-n
             c. IRREALIS:
                1s ˙-d-u                            1s a-d-u
                1p ˙-d˙-i                           1p a-d˙-k
                2s ˙-n-u                            2s a-n-u
                2p ˙-n˙-k                           2p a-n˙-k
                3s ˙-g-u                            3s a-g-u
                3p ˙-g˙-k                           3p a-g˙-k
    We have a few sentences in our corpus in which there is a clear distinction between
“inchoative” and “causative” roots:
   (245)     tsi mo≥ ˙-d-u                   s˙h˙r a-d-u
             I king become-1-IRR:SG city            make-1-IRR:SG
             ‘I will become king and I will make a city.’
    The status of the inchoative realis is confusing, with what appears to be a lot of
variation, and we can say nothing substantive about it.
    As we have shown earlier (see §5.5.1.2), Class II transitive conjugations are patterned
after the “causative” paradigm, i.e. based on the auxiliary verb ‘to do, make,’ as in the
following contrastive examples (‘do’ marks the Class II auxiliary verb root):

                ‘I carried it.’                    ‘I cooked it.’
    Where the verb root ends in a consonant, (246b), or in a vowel radically different
from the first vowel [a] of the causative root ‘make,’ (246c), the causative root surfaces
unscathed – a-t-ßn [make-1-REAL]. Where the verb root ends in [˙] or [a], the two vowels
tend to coalesce, as in (246d).
    We have a few examples in which the inchoative version of the verb root [˙-] can be
used in a kind of “passive” sense, but this is almost expecting too much of the
distinction between [˙] and [a] where the distinction is almost non-existent elsewhere.
The construction is rare in our corpus and needs more research. Following are examples:
   (247)     a. tsya d˙baq ˙-g-u
                tea later      be-3-IRR:SG
                ‘Tea will be made later.’

                he    tea later       cook make-3-IRR:SG
                ‘He/she will cook tea later.’
    The difference between the verb in (247b) hul˙ ˙-g-u and its active counterpart in
(247c) hul˙ a-g-u is so minimal that the contrast may depend more on contrastive syntax
than anything else – the “passive” version is without an agent.","[87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––7.1.2       Morphological causative -da
    Most intransitive verbs can be made transitive by adding the morphological causative
suffix -da. Where such verbs belong inherently to Class I, i.e. having prefixed person
marking, after derivation they become Class II verbs – i.e. having suffixed person
marking. Thus, in the following examples, the (a) sentences are inherently Class I verbs
and their transitive (b) counterparts are Class II. Prefixed person marking is lost:
    (260)      a. INTRANSITIVE
                  ts-ip-ßn
                  1-sleep-REAL                ‘I slept.’
               b. TRANSITIVE
                  ip-da-d-i
                  sleep-CAUS-1-PAST           ‘I put him to sleep.’
    (261)      a. INTRANSITIVE
                  t-o -˙n
                  1-die-REAL                  ‘I died.’
               b. TRANSITIVE
                  o -da-d-i
                  die-CAUS-1-PAST             ‘I killed him.’
    Note that the causative of ‘die,’ i.e. the verb ‘kill’ illustrated in (261b) is very often
pronounced ora- and is an example of a verb developing what may someday become a
suppletive pair whose developmental pathway is opaque – -o) ‘die’ versus ora- ‘kill.’
    For Class II intransitive verbs there is no shift from prefixing to suffixing under
causativization – they begin with suffixed person marking. Such verbs can be made
transitive either by the morphological causative -a or by the morphological causative -da.
The choice of one over the other does not seem to be based on phonological factors or
the syllable type of the root. The verbs ‘sleep’ and ‘die’ both end in consonants and
the causative is formed by -da. But so also do ‘fall’ and ‘wear’ end in consonants, but
the causative is formed by -a (though -da is also possible with no apparent difference in
meaning, though, of course, there may be a difference in “force” for “directness” of
causation). ‘Scorch’ and ‘swell’ end in vowels, but both form the causative by -da.
There is a great deal of variation between the two forms. Following are verbs which can
take either form:
    (262)      a. INTRANSITIVE
                  hyoq-tsi-n

                 insert-CAUS-1-REAL            ‘I inserted (something).’
    Some verbs, in addition to a causative morpheme, manifest some phonological change
in the root morpheme itself. The pair ‘to survive’ versus ‘to rescue’ is one such pair
(from ˙igi- to ˙gi-):
      (264)   a. ˙igi-d-ßn
                 live-1-REAL                   ‘I survived.’
              b. ˙gi-da-d-ßn
                 live-CAUS-1-REAL              ‘I rescued (him).’
    Some intransitives when causativized yield unexpected meanings. Two examples are
the verbs ‘to laugh’ and ‘to say.’ Causativized by the morphological causative they do
not mean ‘make laugh’ or ‘make say,’ but rather ‘laugh at’ and ‘say to.’ (Similar
semantic shifts occur in Nepali, suggesting the possibility of contact induced meanings.)
      (265)   a. gin-da nikæ-e-d-i
                 he-ACC laugh-CAUS-1-PAST
                 ‘I laughed at him.’

                 ‘No matter what I say to him, he cries.’
     It should also be noted that morphological causativization in Kusunda works even
on intransitive “process” verbs which would normally require a periphrastic causative
in English – verbs like ‘rot.’ The implication is that the subject is ultimately responsible
for the eventuality, even if only by neglect or inadvertence. Such causatives are typologically
common in the area, in both TB and IA languages:

    The anti-causative is a detransitivizing derivation on inherently transitive verbs yielding
intransitive and middle senses. In such verbs the “middle” or “anti-causative” <AC> is
marked by the suffix -q. The ‘break’ verbs are among them, as in the following sets of
contrastive pairs:

                 this string break-AC-REAL like          is
                 ‘This string is like it will break.’7.2.1      Anti-causative -q versus lexical -q
    Somewhat problematic are intransitive verb roots in which a final -q is part of the
underived lexical representation. On the surface, such verb roots look like derived
middles, but, in fact, there are no corresponding transitives without the -q. In such cases,
-q is not a derivational marker per se. Rather, the marker is semantically motivated,
occurring on verbs whose inherent status is middle. We will not separate the -q in these
cases, but treat it as part of the underlying root. (If we do find occasion to dissect such
forms, we will mark them as “middle marked” <MM>, recognizing that we are not
dealing with a derivation.) Under causativization, the middle marking remains (often
becoming -)), followed by the morphological causative -a, as in the following:
   (270)      a. wi      gyaq-ßn
                 house collapse-REAL
                 ‘The house collapsed.’

                 ‘The water spilled.’                                            100

                  I water spill-CAUS-1-PAST
                  ‘I spilled the water.’
    It is important to notice the contrast between verbs whose underlying root ends in -q
and verbs whose underlying root is an open syllable. In the former case, -q (or -))
occurs in both transitive and intransitive forms, whereas in the latter case -q occurs only
in the intransitive. Thus, in (272) -q is lexical and the transitive form is derived, and in
(273) -q is derivational and the intransitive form is derived:
    (272)      UNDERLYING -Q:
               a. ta≥    byaq-ßn
                  water spill-REAL
                  ‘The water spilled.’
               b. tsi ta≥       bya -a-d-i             <— transitivized by -a
                  I water spill-CAUS-1-PAST
                  ‘I spilled the water.’
    (273)      OPEN SYLLABLE:
               a. k˙reÚ k˙la-q-ßn                      <— detransitivized by -q
                  jug    break-AC-REAL
                  ‘The jug broke.’

                  I jug       break-1-REAL
                  ‘I broke (shattered) the jug.’
    Another verb with lexical -q in the intransitive member is soq- ‘climb,’ as in:
    (274)      a. tsi soq-ßn
                  I climb-REAL
                  ‘I climbed.’

                  tree-IN climb-CAUS-1-REAL
                  ‘I treed him.’7.2.2       Anti-causative -t
     More difficult to interpret are intransitive verb roots which end in -t. Recall that in
many transitive verb conjugations (like a-t-ßn ‘I made’), -t followed by syllabic -ßn signifies
first person followed by realis. There are numerous intransitive verbs, however, in which
a stem final -t followed by syllabic -ßn does not indicate first person:
    (275)      a. dimi    n~odze gwi-t-ßn
                  smoke above gather-<T>-REAL
                  ‘Smoke (soot) gathered above.’
               b. gag˙ri-ga ta≥         pæiru-t-ßn
                  jug-LOC      water fill-<T>-REAL
                  ‘Water filled in the jug.’
    We have glossed -t in (275a–b) with a tentative <T>. The question is, “Is -t part of
the lexical root or is it a grammatical morpheme?” We know already that -t here is not
                                             101
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Transitivity alternations
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––first person. Following the same line of reasoning we used above, we need to compare
these forms with their causativized counterparts:
    (276)     a. tsi d˙idzi       gwi-˙-d-i
                 I firewood gather-CAUS-1-PAST
                 ‘I gathered firewood.’
              b. gag˙ri-ga ta≥           pæir-a-t-ßn
                 jug-LOC       water fill-CAUS-1-REAL
                 ‘I filled water in the jug.’
     The stem final -t does not occur in the causativized version (*gwi-t-a-t-ßn) and we are
left to conclude that -t is an anti-causative morpheme analogous to the -q we saw earlier.
It turns out, in fact, that we have no verbs in our corpus with root final -t. Where -t
occurs it is always anti-causative <AC>.
     In §5.5.1.2 (subsection intransitive patterns) we saw that Class II intransitive verbs
have the option of including a person marker immediately after the root-final consonant:
    (277)     a. sip-ts-in
                 enter-1-REAL             ‘I entered.’
              b. b˙l-n-in
                 descend-2-REAL           ‘You descended.’
              c. pæep-ts-in
                 fall-1-REAL              ‘I fell.’
              d. hyoq-n-in
                 hide-2-REAL              ‘You hid.’
    Significantly, where the same optional person marking is employed in intransitive
verbs with anti-causative -t, the -t occurs after person marking, separating the -t from the
verb root. This strengthens our hypothesis that -t is not part of the intransitive root:
    (278)     a. nok       gwi-ni-t-n-a-n
                 you[pl] gather-2-AC-2-PL-REAL
                 ‘You all gathered.’
              b. hampe t -a -an kæai-tsi-t-ßn
                 where   1-go-IRR fear-1-AC-REAL
                 ‘Wherever I go I get scared.’
              c. un-da      ts-˙g-˙n      miÚ-tsi-t-ßn
                 road-LOC 1-go-REAL lost-1-AC-REAL
                 ‘Going along the road I got lost.’
    We have numerous other examples, too, of “floating” -t in our data base, but we
will not list them all here.
    It would, of course, be satisfying to our claims if anti-causative -q also floated to the
right of person markers, thus demonstrating that it too is an element divisible from the
verb root. In fact we have no data in our corpus to prove this. (Nor do we have
anything to disprove it.) We have examples of person marking only on verbs in which
-q is part of the root, and as our claims would predict, -q remains attached to the root, as
in: borloq-tsi-n ‘I got boiled,’ and gyaq-tsi-n ‘I collapsed.’

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––7.2.3       Passive
    There is no canonical passive in Kusunda (of the English sort) in which the former
object is promoted to subject status. The closest analogue is the detransitivizing, anti-
causative derivation discussed in §7.2 which produces a kind of “middle.” The derivation,
however, appears to be available only to select transitive verbs.
    Another structure which is not well understood applies to transitive and intransitive
verbs alike. On Class II transitive verbs, the “auxiliary” ending ‘to do, make,’ is
replaced by a sequence -in-dzi. -Dzi occurs elsewhere as a “present tense” marker
(also not well understood; see example (265b)). The first affix, -in, resembles the
Nepali passive marker -in, but the resemblance may be accidental. It might be equally
plausible to think of -in as the intransitive (inchoative) version of ‘to do, make’ (see
(244b)). We will label it as <INCHO> for “inchoative.” Following are examples of its
usage (but with no attempted explanation on how the construction works)3 2:
    (279)      a. ACCOMPANIED BY AN ANTI-CAUSATIVE:
                  dza h~oÚ-˙-go             borlo-q-in-dzi
                  fire burn-CAUS-IMP boil-AC-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Stoke the fire, it (the water) will boil.’
               b. WITHOUT ANTI-CAUSATIVE:
                  qai   u-g-i         ip˙n sola-in-dzi
                  wind come-3-PAST corn break-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Wind comes and the corn breaks.’
               c. ON AN INTRANSITIVE:
                  n˙n gip˙n ts-o -da-d-ßn            dzæ˙m-in-dzi
                  what word 1-say-CAUS-1-REAL weep-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Whatever I say to him, he cries.’
    Note that (279a) is made intranstive by virtue of the <AC> marker -q, and (279c) is
intransitive already. (279b) begins as a transitive verb, and appears to be detransitivized
by the inchoative -in.
    We have several examples of intransitive verbs marked by this construction, but are
uncertain about how the meaning differs from ordinary intransitive conjugation without
-in: kæai-in-dzi ‘He is afraid’; meÚ-in-dzi ‘He gets lost’; dæ~u-in-dzi ‘He stands, rises’;
by~o-in-dzi ‘He sits, squats.’7.2.3.1     “Passive” in ambi-transitive verbs
    It is difficult to say unequivocally whether some verbs are inherently transitive or
intransitive. They can be conjugated as transitive or intransitive without mediating
derivational morphology, and the intransitive version is passive-like. The verb ‘to burn,
roast’ is one such verb, as in the following contrastive pair:
    32
       My anonymous reviewer has suggested that because the -in- marker in all the examples listed
occurs on the second clause of a complex sentence, it might indicate that the second clause event is a
consequence of the first clause event. The suggestion warrants looking into.","[97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"

    No one could have guessed, early in 2004, that before the year was out we would get
lucky with Kusunda. At the time, all we had were a couple of word lists, one from the
1850s and another from the 1970s; plus a short text that was largely uninterpretable.
We knew almost nothing about the grammar – doubly lamentable in light of the fact that
Kusunda was recognized as a language isolate, related to no other language on earth. In
some quarters, the last speaker was reported to have died in 1985, and though some
Nepalese linguists and anthropologists were aware of one or two Kusundas with a vague
memory of their ancestral tongue, the situation was not hopeful, and most of us had
resigned ourselves to the notion that we would never know more about Kusunda than
what we already knew.
    In the midst of this unpromising circumstance, our friends at the National Foundation
for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN), especially Vice-Chairman
Prof. Sant Bahadur Gurung and Member Secretary Mr. Tamla Ukyab, never gave up. It
is impossible to overemphasize our indebtedness to them. In April 2004, with help from
the National Indigenous Nationalities Women’s Forum, they brought three Kusundas to
Kathmandu from Dang Valley to help them with citizenship papers – a practical, first
step in helping them and making a simple thing like land ownership a possibility for
them. They also arranged a press conference in which they introduced the Kusundas to
the public and to the academic community – sociologists, anthropologists, and linguists.
It was there that we discovered that one of them, Ms. Gyani Maiya Sen, had more than a
passive knowledge of Kusunda; she could actually speak it!
    We, at the Central Department of Linguistics (CDL), Tribhuvan University, immediately
made a proposal to Prof. Gurung and Mr. Ukyab to help us in bringing Gyani Maiya
and possibly other Kusunda speakers into Kathmandu for a three month period of
intensive linguistic research. Their response was magnanimous. Not only did NFDIN
agree to fund the research and documentation project, they also sent one of their own
people, Mr. Dinesh Gurung, to Dang to bring the speakers to Kathmandu.
    Once in Kathmandu, Mr. Jagat Gurung, also of NFDIN, dealt with many practical
arrangements, like finding lodging for the Kusundas and taking them on weekend tours
to the zoo and to numerous religious sites. We are grateful for his willing contribution.
We are also grateful to Mr. Stephen Watters, of SIL and CDL, for making digital
recordings of many Kusunda sounds, and to Dinesh Khadga of Kantipur Photo Studio
for making video recordings of several elicitation sessions. All electronic media are now
housed at the CDL library, and make a valuable addition to their language archives.
    Without question, our greatest debt of gratitude goes to the Kusunda speakers who
accepted the invitation to come to Kathmandu – Ms. Gyani Maiya Sen, Ms. Kamala
Singh Khatri, and Mr. Prem Bahadur Shahi Thakuri. Back in Dang, Gyani Maiya
contacted Prem Bahadur, her uncle, and Prem Bahadur contacted Kamala, his niece, who
lived in Rolpa. Only Gyani Maiya had been to Kathmandu before, at the recent invitation
of NFDIN. But for all of them, a three month stay in Kathmandu was a leap of faith.
They were at the mercy of strangers, not knowing fully what to expect. When they
arrived, they quickly settled into their new situation, cheerfully sharing their language
and their lives.
    Four of us at CDL, Linguistics Chair Prof. Yogendra Prasad Yadava, Prof. Madhav
Prasad Pokharel, Mr. Balaram Prasain, and myself, had separate, daily sessions with our
new-found friends, keeping them busy the whole day long. Once a week, we debriefed
                                           5

of the linguistics department. I should make clear that the three participants do not
necessarily agree with all my interpretations presented in this grammar. Any and all
errors are my own.
    At the end of the research period, NFDIN hosted another press conference, at which
the Kusundas were fêted, and the principal investigators were given opportunity to
present their findings. An invited speaker, State Minister for Local Development Mr.
Krishna Gopal Shrestha, promised his support for projects aimed at uplifting indigenous
nationalities. Several other dignitaries, including Prof. Sant Bahadur Gurung, Prof.
Yogendra Prasad Yadava, Prof. Madhav Prasad Pokharel, Prof. Novel Kishore Rai, and
visiting Prof. Sueyoshi Toba, gave unanimous voice to the overriding value of language
documentation and preservation efforts. The conference was reported in all the major
Nepalese dailies for Asoj 24, 2061, BS (October 10, 2004).
    A special note of thanks goes to Professors R. M. W. Dixon and Alexandra Aikhenvald
for inviting me as an Honorary Visiting Fellow to their Research Centre for Linguistic
Typology (RCLT) at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. I was able to spend
three months, uninterrupted, analyzing my notes and writing the present grammar. I was
also given opportunity to present my findings and analysis at an RCLT seminar, receiving
valuable suggestions and comments from Robert Dixon, Alexandra Aikhenvald, Randy
LaPolla, John Saeed, Gerrold Sadock, Ghil‘ad Zuckermann, and John Hajek.
    I would also like to thank Alexandra Aikhenvald, Scott DeLancey, David Bradley,
Sueyoshi Toba, and Stephen Watters for reading an earlier draft of this grammar and
making valuable comments. I have not incorporated all of them, and any shortcomings
are my own.
    Last, but not least, I wish to thank the Himalayan Linguistics anonymous reviewer
who took a close, critical view of the first edition of this grammar (the NFDIN version)
and made a number of very helpful suggestions. Many of those recommendations I
have followed and incorporated into this current edition.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

say to you, don’t sleep!’? If not, -tsi marks some unknown category:

                  2-sleep-1-PROH           ‘Don’t sleep!’

    Some verbs are capable of taking either the -in prohibitive or the prohibitive ˙-yin
based on the verb ‘to do.’ In the majority of cases, this makes for an intransitive/transitive
difference, as in: bem-in ‘Don’t fall!’ vs. bem ˙-yin ‘Don’t make him fall!’ (See §9.2
on Periphrastic causatives.)
    The verbs that concern us here, however, are those which take either ending without a
perceptible difference in meaning. Following are examples:
(206)          a.   n-o -˙n / n-o ˙-yin              ‘Don’t die!’
               b.   n-o ˆ-˙n / n~o ˆ ˙-yin           ‘Don’t drink!’
               c.   pumba-n-in / pumba ˙-yin         ‘Don’t beat him!’
               d.   hab-en / hab˙ ˙-yin              ‘Don’t roast it!’
               e.   tsim-in / tsim˙ ˙-yin            ‘Don’t touch it!’
    Further research may reveal varying levels of transitivity or even levels of intentionality
in such verb pairs.","[78, 79]"
"10.1.1.1 Negation of the medial verb
   Where the medial verb in a clause chain is negated, the scope of negation is local – it
applies to that verb alone. Following are examples:
   (344)      a. tsi t-˙m-daÚ u          t-ug-un
                 I 1-eat-REAL:NEG        1-come-REAL
                 ‘I came without eating.’ (lit. ‘I didn’t eat, I came.’)

                 bathe-3-REAL:NEG 3-eat-REAL
                 ‘He ate without bathing.’ (lit. ‘He didn’t bathe, he ate.’)
              c. teina tumba-d-aÚ u,             goraq       tumb˙-d-u

                 ‘Not finishing it today, I’ll finish it tomorrow.’10.1.1.2 Negation of the final verb
   We have very few examples of this structure, but the ones that we do have often
imply “condition,” which will be treated more fully in §11.2. Following are two                                            126

                  ‘(If) we eat the medicine we won’t die.’

               ‘He bathed (but) he didn’t eat.’10.1.2      A second negative
   Both medial and final verbs sometimes employ a second negative. Though we can
surmise on the origin of its structure, we do not know how this negative differs semantically
from the one illustrated in §10.1.1 above. We give two examples of a medial verb
negated by this second negative (a–b), and one example of a final verb (c):
    (347)      a. gina po≈la kæaÚ i              g-˙m-˙n
                  he    bathe be:REAL:NEG 3-eat-REAL
                  ‘He didn’t bathe and he ate.’ (He ate without bathing.)
               b. wa     uga    kæaÚ i         un-da        ip-dzi
                  home come be:REAL:NEG trail-LOC sleep-TAM
                  ‘He didn’t come home and he slept on the trail.’ OR
                  ‘Not coming home, he slept on the trail.’
               c. gimi       meÚ-d-i     d~aba-n˙ kæaÚ i
                  money lose-1-PAST, find-2          be:REAL:NEG
                  ‘I lost the money and you didn’t find it.’
    Beginning with (347a), the expected negative form for a finite, realis Class II verb
would be po≈la-g-aÚi (bathe-3-REAL:NEG), the -g being a third person agreement marker.
The negative kæaÚi, on the other hand, is the negative existential copula, now used as
negation marker on non-copular verbs. (See Negative existential under §6.1.2.1.) The
use of copular verbs in modality systems, of course, is widespread in the languages of
the world, South Asia included. This is the first instance, however, that we have seen it
in Kusunda.
    In §8.1.4 we saw examples of bare verb roots used in concatenative structures like
hol t-˙m-du (cook 1-eat-IRR:SG) ‘I’ll cook and eat.’ The first root, hol, is followed by a
second finite root, t-˙m-du, without intervening morphology of any kind. The negative
construction that we are dealing with here is a parallel structure – the negative copula
follows the bare root. It is reasonable that such “bare root” verbs should be negated by
the existential, without all the finite machinery of conjugated verbs.
    The form of the final verb in (347c) is also unexpected. We would expect d~aba-n-aÚi
(find-2-REAL:NEG). Final verbs are always finite, being marked for TAM and person/num-                                            127

the first root. It is very likely, in fact, that the grammaticalization pathway for d~aba-n-aÚi
is < *d~aba-n˙ kæaÚi.
    It may turn out, then, after further study, that the “concatenative” structure is the
“real” clause chaining device and the structures illustrated in (342) are coordinated
“co-ranking” structures on the English model.","[126, 127, 128]"

3.      Linguistic type
     Kusunda is related to no other language or language family of South Asia; indeed,
as far as we can tell, to no other language on earth – it is a true linguistic “isolate”.
There are, to be sure, a few lexical borrowings from surrounding languages, both from
Indo-Aryan and from Tibeto-Burman. But all such borrowings are relatively recent and
have nothing to do with its genetic lineage.
     The status of some linguistic isolates can be extremely difficult to determine; such
languages may have been sufficiently influenced through long-term contact with
surrounding languages that they begin to resemble them both grammatically and lexically.
The original language provides only a substrate. Kusunda has not escaped at least some
such influence, but, by and large, it remains a typological isolate – i.e. it is phonologically,
lexically, and grammatically distinct. Thus, we can be reasonably safe in assuming that
throughout most of its history Kusunda developed in isolation, and only in recent times
has it had contact with other linguistic types.
     Phonologically, Kusunda possesses sounds that do not exist in other languages of
the region – namely, uvular and pharyngealized consonants. Conversely, there are
sounds found throughout the region, like retroflex consonants, that do not occur in
Kusunda. Furthermore, the point of articulation in Kusunda is more-or-less immaterial,
it is the active articulator that counts as contrastive.
     The uvular consonants are accompanied by the concomitant features of pharyngeal
stricture and lower fundamental frequencies on preceding vowels. Such features, in fact,
are often the primary auditory cues to their presence.
     The voicing contrast in Kusunda is neutralized in many consonants, having a lesser
functional load than in surrounding languages.
     Vowels in Kusunda occur partially in harmonic sets, an upper set comprising three
vowels and a lower set comprising three vowels. There is considerable free variation
between the two sets, and only in a few words can opposing vowels in upper and lower
sets be shown to be contrastive. This suggests that Kusunda may have at one time had a
simple, three vowel system – i, a, o.
     Consonant sounds in Kusunda occur at many points of articulation – bilabial, dental,
alveolar, palatal, retroflex, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal. Most of the points,
however, are non-contrastive, and there can sometimes be considerable variation even in
single words. What is more material for Kusunda, then, is to describe consonant
sounds in terms of their active articulator – labial, apical, laminal, velar, and uvular/pha-
ryngeal. An apical consonant, for example, can be dental, alveolar, or retroflex.
     One of the most striking and unusual aspects of Kusunda grammar is the means by
which “marked” structures are distinguished from “unmarked” ones. The “mark” is
not an affix, as typical of the region or indeed of the languages of the world, but rather, a
harmonic autosegmental process (which we will refer to as “mutation”) that spreads
“retraction” across the entire word. Apical consonants become laminal, velar consonants
become uvular, and vowels from the upper set shift to the lower set. The process
appears to be very old, and occurs today only in a very small subset of high frequency
verbs.
     Vestiges of this striking morphophonological process are still apparent in several
categories and may represent the morphologization of a single process in different
contexts – all ‘marked’ categories. Thus, the marked modality is irrealis (while the
unmarked category is realis); the marked polarity is negative; the marked transitivity is
                                              20

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––causative; and the marked dependency is dependent. All of these systems utilize mutation
as a mark (at least to a partial extent).
    There are very few case marking affixes in Kusunda, but an affix -da occurs as a
distinguishing morpheme in numerous systems. In some cases a single etymological
source can be plausibly inferred – -da is a local case marker, the marker of an animate
object in transitive clauses, and occurs in some complement clauses. In other cases,
different morphemes that just happen to be homophonous must be assumed – -da is a
plural number agreement in verbs, a marker of incompletive aspect, and a morphological
causative.
    Syntax in Kusunda follows a basic SV, AOV constituent order, with alternative
orders used to mark specialized pragmatic notions. This is common in the linguistic
area. Subject NPs are often deleted in running discourse, the person and number of the
subject actant being recoverable from obligatory person–number agreement markers in
the verb. In terms of grammatical case marking, Kusunda follows a nominative–accusative
case marking alignment – something unusual for the languages of the region.
    Verbs in Kusunda divide broadly into Class I and Class II. In Class I verbs, person
agreement is marked by prefixes and number by suffixes, whereas in Class II verbs both
person agreement and number is marked by suffixes. Class I verbs are old with a lot of
irregularity in the paradigms and an abundance of suppletive forms. The majority of
verbs belong to Class II. Such verbs can be thought of as “non-inflecting,” i.e. all
inflection falls on an auxiliary based on the verb ‘to make, to do.’ Class II intransitive
verbs are basically bereft of person marking, with a new, innovative person marking
distinction developing in some contexts.
    The basic TAM system in Kusunda makes a binary distinction between realis and
irrealis. Class II verbs have also developed a past tense distinction, a distinction that is
generally missing from Class I verbs.
    There are derivational operations in Kusunda whereby inherently intransitive verbs
can be made transitive, and inherently transitive verbs made intransitive – the latter a kind
of “middle” derivation. Both operations are morphological, and causativization always
yields a Class II verb. Periphrastic causatives are also possible, in which case the caused
event is embedded to the causativizing matrix verb ‘to make, to do.’
    Verb subordination (or embedding) occurs in numerous Kusunda structures – relative
clauses, verbal complements, periphrastic causatives, and applicatives. A striking feature
in Kusunda, unusual for the typology of the region, is that such embedded structures
appear not to be nominalized (although our so-called ‘neutral’ verbs are possible candidates
for nominalization; see §8.1 and §9.1.2). Most subordinate structures are fully finite
and their embedded status is signalled entirely by their syntax. (In mutating verbs,
subordination is also marked by mutation.)
    Some, but not all, clause chains in Kusunda are marked by converbs. Unusual,
however, is that converbs in Kusunda do not mark sequential events, but “overlapping”
ones. Sequential chains are marked by a series of fully finite verbs. Certain periphrastic
causatives, as well as some complements (like ‘teaching how to do something’) are
marked by overlapping converbs. A structure which on the surface looks deceptively
like the benefactive in surrounding languages, is, in fact, only an overlapping converbal
structure. The benefactive, at least for some non-inflecting (Class II) verbs, is marked
by the auxiliary ‘give’ in place of the auxiliary ‘make, do.’ In most cases, however, it
requires no derivational machinery and is formed simply by the addition of a dative
argument.","[19, 20, 21]"
"5.5.7.2.    Optative
    • Optative in Class I verbs. The optative, especially in Class I verbs, has a paradigmatic
relationship to the imperative. The negative imperative (the prohibitive), for example,
employs the second person prefix n-, whereas the optative (either the negative, positive,
or both) employs the third person prefix g-. Apart from this simple generalization, the
paradigm is very irregular. Following are examples:
    (212)                             PROHIBITIVE            OPTATIVE
              a.   ‘go’               n-iw-˙n                g-ya
              b.   ‘come’             n-ug-in                g-u-ya
              c.   ‘die’              n-o -˙n                g-o -ya
              d.   ‘sleep’            n-ip-in                g-ip-da
              e.   ‘drink’            n-~oˆ -˙ni             g-oˆ -na
              f.   ‘put’              ??                     g-o -ta
              g.   ‘see’              ˘-~aÚ-yin              g-~aˆ -na
    Notice here, too, that Class I verbs, whether transitive or intransitive, follow similar
conjugational patterns. Class II verbs, mostly transitive, are the ones that diverge.
    There are also negative optatives in our data set (as in ‘Let him not go’), but
generally they are so confused and incomplete that we will not attempt to present them
here, except to say that some of them appear to take the prohibitive suffix -in, and others
the irrealis negative suffix -wa:
    (213)                           POSITIVE              NEGATIVE

   Our data is insufficient to make any predictions, but it is interesting to note that
negative -wa occurs only in the absence of third person g-. Wherever g- occurs, the
negative suffix used is the prohibitive -in.",[81]
"    • Nasal consonant harmony with uvular consonants. In a process of anticipatory
assimilation, the alveolar nasal consonant in the sequence [na] is realized as a palatal
consonant [¯a] wherever the following consonant is uvular, as in the following:
    (72)     a.   [gi¯aq]            ‘trousers’
             b.   [¯aqtsin]          ‘I wait.’
             c.   [¯a an]            ‘You will go.’
             d.   [¯aˆ an]           ‘You sat.’
             e.   [¯~aˆ di]1 3       ‘wife’
             f.   [¯~aˆ gitse]       ‘daughter’
             g.   [¯~aˆ dzi]         ‘You look.’     • Establishing underlying [)] in contexts where it is “compressed”. There are
several constructions in Kusunda in which an underlying [ ] can be posited based on
the two principles discussed immediately above – pharyngealization (plus lowered pitch)
and consonantal harmony. The negative construction is one such context. Uvular [ ] is
compressed to such an extent in these kinds of high frequency environments that only
its secondary (concomitant) phonetic features are perceptible.
     In the first pair below we give the affirmative forms for ‘I went,’ and ‘You went.’ In
the second pair are the negative forms:
    (73)     a. [ts˙g˙n]           ‘I went.’
             b. [n˙g˙n]            ‘You went.’
    (74)     a. [t aÚ u]      <    [t a u]        ‘I did not go.’
             b. [¯aÚ u]       <    [¯a u]         ‘You did not go.’
    In (74a) and (74b), the sequence [aÚ u] comes from an underlying [a u], as evidenced
by pharyngealization on the vowel preceding [ ]. Evidence for underlying [ ] is further
supported by the change from [ts] and [n] affirmative to [t ] and [¯] negative in (74a–b).",[41]
"11.2.2.1 With continuity of TAM
    We have numerous examples in our corpus in which both sides of a conditional
clause, the protasis and the apodosis, are marked for irrealis. We have already seen in
§11.2 that the final clause of a conditional construction must be marked irrealis, and it is
not at all surprising that in a language for which irrealis marking is available, the protasis
side of the conditional should also be marked irrealis. (The surprising thing is that
irrealis marking is not always required on the protasis, a matter that we will discuss in                                            136

                 ‘If it rains tomorrow I won’t go.’11.2.2.2 With discontinuity of TAM
   In conditional constructions it is also possible that the protasis side of the construction
be marked for realis, replacing the expected irrealis. Here we get a disjunction of TAM
marking, as in the following:
    (368)     a. goraq          ta≥    g-iw-˙n       tsi ts-˙g-wa
                 tomorrow water 3-go-REAL I              1-go-NEG:IRR

                 2-eat-NEG:REAL cold-3-IRR:SG
                 ‘If you don’t drink it, it will get cold.’
     It is not known how the semantic interpretation of the sentences in (368) should
differ from those in (367). Some kind of evidential might be implied here. For
example, it might be that with realis marking in the protasis the speaker is stating
something about general knowledge – “If you don’t drink the tea, it will get cold” – or
even about his level of commitment to the outcome – “If it rains tomorrow (and I expect
it to do so), I will not go.” In any event, it is likely that the speaker is more strongly
committed to the possibility that the event in the first clause, though conditional, will
actually occur – something similar to the differences reflected in the English saying
“Not if, but when!” With irrealis in the conditional, nothing is certain, and the speaker
makes no commitment about the outcome.","[136, 137]"

        It is interesting to note that in Reinhard and Toba’s (1970) description, the word for ‘son’ is
listed as duguci [dugutsi], which also, very likely, includes a contracted form for [getse] ‘child,
offspring.’                                                 23
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Phonology
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––4.3.       Vowels
   As already mentioned, Kusunda has six vowels, three forming an upper set and three
forming a lower set, as in the following:
   (9)       Kusunda vowels:
                i           u
                      ˙
                e           o
                      a
    In terms of absolute contrasts, it is difficult to find contrastive pairs of words in
which the consonants remain constant, but one word utilizes a vowel from the upper set
and the other word utilizes the corresponding vowel from the lower set – i.e. minimal
pairs for vowels. In many words, especially within polysyllabic morphemes, there is a
certain amount of free variation between the two sets (as borne out in tape recordings
from one day to the next). Following are examples:
    (10)     Variation between [i] and [e]:
              a. gitsi          ~       getse            ‘child’
              b. gip˙n          ~       gep˙n            ‘language’
              c. gidzi          ~       gidze            ‘name’
              d. mihaq          ~       mehaq            ‘Kusunda’
              e. yi≥gu          ~       ye≥gu            ‘stone’
   Interestingly, the variation reported in (10a) constitutes a minimal pair in careful
speech:
    (11)       a. gitsi         ‘thorn’
               b. getse         ‘child’
     Likewise, similar variation occurs between [u] and [o] as well as between [˙] and [a],
as illustrated in the following examples:
   (12)      Variation between [u] and [o]:
              a. gulu≥         ~       golo≥             ‘round’
              b. mu≥           ~       mo≥               ‘king’
              c. hyudzi         ~       hyodzi           ‘fat, swollen’
              d. tukan         ~       tokan             ‘know’
              e. hul˙dßn       ~       holadßn           ‘I cooked it.’
    (13)     Variation between [˙] and [a]:
              a. gidz˙≥         ~       gidza≥           ‘body’
              b. k˙p˙≥          ~       k˙pa≥            ‘tumeric’
              c. hul˙dßn        ~       holadßn          ‘I cooked it.’
    As with the contrast between gitsi ‘thorn’ and getse ‘child’ illustrated in (11), with
these vowels too, contrastive pairs can be found, as in the following:
    (14)       a. pæuÚdzi       ‘He jumped.’
               b. pæoÚdzi       ‘He shot.’
    (15)       a. gip˙n         ‘language’
               b. gipan         ‘flower’                                             24

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    It turns out that much of the free variation we encountered occurs in polysyllabic
words where [h] or one of the velar sounds [k], [g], or [≥] occurs. It is significant, in
this respect, that uvular sounds, especially the voiced ones [ ], and [ˆ], occur only with
vowels [o] and [a], displaying a kind of harmony within a syllable.7 It is not altogether
surprising, then, to find their neighbors, the velar sounds, somewhat ambivalent in their
preference of upper or lower vowels.
    Though minimal contrasts are rare in our data set, the following words and morphemes
further illustrate the contrast between upper vowels [i, u, ˙] and lower vowels [e, o, a]:
    (16)     [i]                                             [e]

             a. ˙di            ‘I became’                    adi           ‘I made’

    (See also the contrast between inchoative ˙- ‘become’ and causative a- ‘make’ in
§6.1.4 and example (243).)4.3.1.     Vowels and uvular consonants
   Only vowels [o] and [a] can occur following uvular consonants.8 The constraint,
however, is unidirectional – it is a constraint on the consonant, not on vowels. Other
consonants, too, can occur with [o] or [a], as in the following:
    (19)     a. qan                 ‘itch’
             b. kan                 ‘sharp’
             c. ˙ga                 ‘Come!’
    (20)     a. qolom               ‘bad’
             b. kolumu              ‘owl’
             c. goloq               ‘sheep’    7
          This occurs also in Eskimo-Aleut. Bergsland (1997:21) reports that the vowels [u], [i], and [a]
occur before labial or velar consonants, but in contact with uvular consonants they become [o], [e], and
[a], all retracted.
    8
        In Reinhard and Toba’s transcription all [q]s are followed by an [a] or [o], though they too seem
to have found some phonemic evidence for a [k] vs. [q] contrast in central vowels.","[23, 24, 25]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––8.1.2       In Class II transitive verbs
   Class II transitive verbs, too, for the most part, can occur in a neutral form. This is
especially true if the verb root ends in a consonant, as in:
    (289)      a. tok kæaidzi dza -˙n ts-i-da-n
                  we food      buy-NEUT 1-go-PL-REAL
                  ‘We went to buy food.’
               b. tsi amba hab-˙n         t-ug-un
                  I meat roast-NEUT 1-come-REAL
                  ‘I came to roast meat.’
               c. amba pad-˙n          ts-i-d˙-i
                  meat hunt-NEUT 1-go-PL-HORT
                  ‘Let’s go hunting (for animals).’
    In these Class II transitive verbs, it is difficult to know if the so-called neutral forms
are only contracted third person realis forms – ˙-g-˙n (do-3-REAL) > -˙n. Many third
person realis forms, pronounced simply as -˙n by Kamala, are pronounced -˙g˙n by
Gyani Maiya. The third person -g tends to surface more readily in open syllable roots:
    (290)      kæaidzi ai-g-˙n        t-ug-un
               food     beg-3-REAL 1-come-REAL
               ‘I came to beg for food.’
    Forms like the one in (290) are problematic in that they use a third person form in
the complement (‘to beg’), a form technically incompatible with first person in the
matrix verb (‘I came’). Thus, although forms like ai-g-˙n, too, are neutral or generic in
function, we will reserve the label “neutral” to those forms that are without third person
marking (as in (289)); especially where the form is incompatible with third person. (For
less finite forms for some of these verbs see §8.2.2.)8.1.3       In Class I verbs
    Class I verbs are the least amenable to non-finite conjugation for the simple reason
that such verbs normally include a prefixed person marker. In such cases, a third person
form is used (somewhat analogous to the form in (290) in which third person seems to
be understood as generic, as in:
    (291)      g-˙m-˙n       kæaidzi
               3-eat-REAL food
               ‘eaten food’ / ‘food eaten by (someone)’8.1.4       Bare roots (concatenative structures)
    There are a few verbs for which only the bare root occurs in neutral constructions,
without the final -n, in a concatenative structure. This possibility is apparently lexically
determined and is not available for all verbs:
    (292)      a. ta≥    kola t-ug-un
                  water draw 1-come-REAL
                  ‘I came to draw water.’

                    cook 1-eat-IRR:SG
                    ‘I’ll cook and eat.’
   In a sense, all Class II transitives modelled after the verb ‘to do’ are a special case of
bare-root neutral verbs (i.e. “non-inflecting verbs”) – here followed by a conjugated
form of the verb ‘to make, to do.’ Following is an example of a typical Class II verb:
      (293)      qaÚi  u-g-i         ip˙n suml˙        ˙-g˙-n-dzi
                 wind come-3-PAST corn break           do-3-REAL-TAM (?)
                 ‘Wind comes and breaks the corn.’8.2       Embedded structures marked by -da
    There are several subordinate clause types – like the purposive, the desiderative, and
non-implicative causatives – that are marked by the suffix -da on the embedded verb.
We will refer to this morpheme as the “purposive” <PURP> morpheme. This -da may
be related to the verb ‘go,’ in which case it would be analogous to purposive constructions
in some TB languages, as in the following Kham example:
      (294)      ≥aÚ zya-na ≥a-hu-ke
                 I    eat-GO 1-come-PFV
                 ‘I came to eat.’
    An alternative is to identify -da with the object marker -da. (Ultimately, of course,
the two may be etymologically related, the object marker itself having derived from ‘go,’
not unusual in the world’s languages.) Interestingly, -da does not occur on relatives, but
is exclusive to complements, and it is in these kinds of contexts that -da ‘go’ begins to
specialize as -da ‘object.’8.2.1         Non-finite forms marked by -da
    Some types of subordinate clauses are marked by the purposive morpheme -da
suffixed to the non-finite, bare root of the embedded verb. The -da suffix, however,
occurs in this “pure” form (we will see modified forms later) on Class I verbs (i.e.
those with potential prefixed person marking), and only after the person marking prefix
has been stripped away (an exception is given in §8.2.2). Thus, the verb ‘to sleep,’ for
example, occurs in its inflected forms with prefixed person marking – ts-ip-ßn ‘I sleep’;
n-ip-ßn ‘You sleep’; g-ip-ßn ‘He sleeps.’ In the non-finite -da structure, however, only
the bare root ip- occurs with -da suffixed:
      (295)      a. tsi ip-da          t-ug-un
                    I sleep-PURP 1-come-REAL
                    ‘I came to sleep.’
                 b. nu ip-da          n-ug-un
                    you sleep-PURP 2-come-REAL
                    ‘You came to sleep.’
                 c. gina ip-da        u-g-i
                    he sleep-PURP come-3-PAST
                    ‘He came to sleep.’
      Likewise with the verb ‘to eat’:

    The important thing to notice in examples (295) and (296) is that the embedded verb
occurs without person agreement prefixes, and that -da occurs invariant, as -da throughout.
Both of these points will contrast with “inflected -da structures” in §8.2.3.
    The bare root forms for these Class I verbs are the same suppletive forms we saw
earlier in §5.5.5.1 (Irregular and suppletive forms). ‘To drink’ is another such verb:
   (297)      tsya qon-da           t -a -an
              tea drink-PURP 1-go-IRR:SG
              ‘I will go to drink tea.’8.2.2      Non-finite Class II verbs marked by -da
    Recall from §8.1.2 that the -˙n “neutral” forms for Class II transitive verbs may, in
fact, be generic third person forms whose full form is -˙g˙n. For at least some verbs of
that class there is also a suppletive form of the verb which combines with -da to form a
non-finite structure. The transitive verb par excellence ‘to do, make’ is one such verb.
Where the inflected forms of the verb are a-d-i ‘I made’; a-n-i ‘You made’; ˙-g-˙n ‘He
made’; the non-finite form is ˙n- as follows:
   (298)      a. tsi wi       ˙n-da         o~ ˆ la-t-ßn
                 I house make-PURP want-1-REAL

                 work do-PURP send-1-PAST
                 ‘I sent him to do work.’
     Likewise, there is also a less finite structure for the verb ‘to beg’ than the one
illustrated in example (290) of §8.1.2. It is as follows:
   (299)      ai-da       t-ug-un
              beg-PURP 1-come-REAL
              ‘I came to beg.’8.2.3      Inflected forms marked by -da
    The forms in this section will contrast with those described in §8.2.1. Furthermore,
the structures described in this section are available to both Class I and Class II verbs.","[106, 107, 108, 109]"
"4.1.     Harmony
    Vowels in Kusunda, at least to a certain extent, occur in two harmonic sets — an
upper set (i, ˙, u) and a lower set (e, a, o). In some environments, like the environment of
uvular ‘q’ or ‘ ,’ the lower set predominates, but in other environments there is considerable
free variation between the two sets – [i] varies with [e], [˙] varies with [a], and [u] varies
with [o]. Upon closer investigation, however, it becomes apparent that the two sets are,
in fact, contrastive and that the variation is related to an intrinsic tendency of
consonant–vowel “harmony” in certain parts the language.
    Our attempts at nailing down vowels were constantly frustrated. One day the form
for ‘I cooked’ would be [hul˙dßn] and the next day it would be [holadßn], with no
apparent difference in meaning. Fairly predictably, though, [u] would occur in conjunction
with [˙], as in [hul˙dßn], and [o] would occur with [a], as in [holadßn]. In some cases the
harmonics mark a grammatical category, as in [n˙g˙n] ‘You went’ versus [¯a an] ‘You
will go.’ (We will treat this in more detail in §4.4.2.4 on Apcial nasals and §5.5.3.1 on
Mutation.)
    Consonants are diverse with bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal, retroflex, velar, uvular,
pharyngeal, and glottal points of articulation, but not all are contrastive. An apical sound
represented by /t/, for example, has numerous allophones – [@t], [t], [Ê] [c] – and at times
the choice of one over the other seems unprincipled. The laminal/palatal series appears
to have only weak contrastive lexical status, but it does play a contrastive role in some
grammatical systems.5 Laminals and uvulars tend to co-occur in harmonic sets.
    Our analysis shows a contrast between the cardinal values for velar and uvular
consonants, but because of a certain amount of variation at the extremes we often had
difficulty in distinguishing certain varieties of velar consonants from certain varieties of
uvular consonants. The phoneme [k], for example, appears to have two major variants –
a pre-velar [k] occurring before front vowels, and a post-velar [ßk] occurring before back
vowels, and it is particularly in these ‘back’ environments that [ßk] is hardly distinguishable
from [q]. But the fact remains that some grammatical contrasts depend upon the
velar/uvular contrast. The already cited contrast between [n˙g˙n] ‘You went’ and [¯a an]     5
        Alexandra Aikhenvald has pointed out to me that a distinction between the phonology of roots
and the phonology of inflectional morphology can also be found in languages like Hebrew, with
""servile"" consonants being a subset of ""radical"" consonants. See, for example, Roediger 1874.",[22]
"6.1.2       Existential copula
   The existential copula is tsu in the positive and kæaÚu in the negative. It does not
conjugate for person, number, or for tense (that we are aware of), although there are
some limited aspectual notions supported by it. The same copulas (positive and negative)
used for existential senses are also used in predicate adjective constructions.",[87]
"5.5.2.2.   Class II person and number marking
    In Class II irrealis mode, the sequences -d-u (157a) and -d-˙k (157b) may appear
superficially to be equivalent to the -du (153a–155a) and -da-k (153b–155b) of Class I
verbs. In fact, however, the Class I and Class II forms are composed of different
morpheme sequences (clearly as a consequence of reanalysis due to person suffixation
in Class II – see also summary in (166–167)):

     The Class II -d-u / -d-˙k forms are in paradigmatic opposition to second person -n-u

    Likewise, the realis forms also distinguish between -d ‘first person,’ -n ‘second
person,’ and -g ‘third person,’ as in:

                  beat-3-REAL             ‘He/she/they beat (someone).’
    Class II verbs also have a past tense. As is true for irrealis and realis modes, so too
in past tense the suffixes -d, -n, and -g mark first, second, and third person, respectively.
Following is the paradigm:
    (163)     FIRST PERSON
              a. pumba-d-i
                 beat-1-SG:PAST           ‘I beat (someone).’
              b. pumba-d-ei
                 beat-1-PL:PAST           ‘We beat (someone).’
    (164)     SECOND PERSON
              a. pumba-n-i
                 beat-2-SG:PAST           ‘You beat (someone).’
              b. pumba-n-ei
                 beat-2-PL:PAST           ‘You [pl] beat (someone).’
    (165)     THIRD PERSON
              a. pumba-(g)-i
                 beat-3-SG:PAST           ‘He/she beat (someone).’
              b. pumba-(g)-ei
                 beat-3-PL:PAST           ‘They beat (someone).’
    Thus, in Class I verbs, where person markers are prefixed, the sequences -da and -du
are indivisible, single morphemes – -da functions as a plural marker and -du as a
singular irrealis marker. In Class II verbs, -da and -du are forced to coalesce with
suffixed person markers -d, -n, and -g, resulting in a reinterpretation of the data. The
-du of Class I becomes the -d-u, -n-u, and -g-u of Class II; the -da-n of Class I becomes
the -d-˙n, -n-˙n, and -g-˙n of Class II; and, finally, the -da-k of Class I becomes the
-d-˙k, -n-˙k, and -g-˙k of Class II.

                  plural                    g- ∑ -da-k            ∑ -g -˙k5.5.3.      Tense-aspect-modality (TAM)
    For most verbs in Kusunda there is, what appears to be, a three-way tense distinction
– past, present, and future. By contrast, and central to our understanding of the three-way
distinction, however, Class I verbs have only a two-way distinction. Past and present
time are generally grouped together into a “realis” mode, and its opposite, “irrealis,”
marks future time and possibility. Realis, in some cases, however, can also occur with
future events, especially where certainty is high; such events are “perceptually located in
the real world” (Elliott 2000). Elliott claims that this is the case for a number of
Australian languages; “tense does not necessarily reflect reality status” (Elliott 2000:68).
    Evidence suggests that the realis–irrealis distinction is older and more primary than
the so-called a “past–present–future” distinction. In fact, past tense (see Table 3)
appears to be only an added category; it occupies some of the same semantic space as
realis (see §5.5.4 on Negation) and, more significantly, its absence does not constitute a
“present” tense (indicated by the “strike through” in Table 3). Rather, the absence of
“past” is only realis. The major difference between past and realis is that past has an
unequivocal past–completive reading, while realis is used more frequently in utterances
with a kind of “neutral” or “timeless” sense, as in the verb ‘build’ in the following
sentences:
    (168)      a. pyana        tsi wi          a-t-ßn,          t˙~îna   ts-ip-du
                  yesterday I        house build-1-REAL, today           1-sleep-IRR
                  ‘Yesterday I built a house, today I will sleep.’                                             66

                 yesterday     I      house build-1-PAST, today 1-sleep-IRR
                 ‘Yesterday I built (finished) a house, today I will sleep.’
    Past–present–future in Kusunda, then, is only the fiction of a three-way division.
The real distinction is past–realis–irrealis. Thus, in Table 3, Class I verbs are those with
a two-way distinction, and Class II verbs add a further distinction for a total of three.

   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  Table 3. TWO-WAY CLASS I DISTINCTION, AND THREE-WAY CLASS II DISTINCTION    From Table 3 we see that both verb classes mark future and unrealized (irrealis)
events with -u / -k, and realis events with -n. Class II verbs, in addition, mark past
completive events with -i (singular) or -ei (plural).
    The realis form is partially compatible with future time adverbials, although not in
independent utterances as in (169a). It can be used, however, with future time adverbials
in what appears to be a kind of neutral, timeless sense, as in (169b):
   (169)      a. *goraq      tsi ts-˙g-˙n
                 *tomorrow I      1-go-REAL
                 *‘I went tomorrow.’
              b. t˙~în   wi       a-t-ßn,        goraq      ts-ip-ßn
                 today house 1-make-REAL, tomorrow 1-sleep-REAL
                 ‘Today I build a house, tomorrow I sleep.’
    Irrealis, on the other hand, is fully compatible with future time. Thus, it can occur
with future time adverbials, or with present time adverbials extendable to a future reading,
as in the following:
   (170)      a. goraq     tsi t -a -an
                 tomorrow I      1-go-IRR
                 ‘Tomorrow I will go.’
              b. d˙baq tsi t -a -an
                 now      I   1-go-IRR
                 ‘I will go now.’ (‘I haven’t started yet, but I’m ready to go.’)
    Irrealis is not compatible with past time, (unless it occurs with incompletive -da, in
which case it carries a sense of ‘would have’ or ‘was about to’ – see §5.5.3.6). Its
incompatibility with past time adverbials is illustrated in the following example:
   (171)      *pyana        tsi t -a -an
              *yesterday I 1-go-IRR
              *‘Yesterday I will go.’                                            67

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––5.5.3.1.    Mutation
    In a small subset of Class I verbs (high frequency verbs like ‘go’ and ‘come’) a
process of “mutation,” is used in marking the realis–irrealis distinction.2 5 Apparently,
the process is old; it is being replaced by a newer and more regular affixation pattern.
For “mutating” verbs, then, there are two equivalent irrealis forms – those marked by
mutation (172b, 173b, and 175) and those marked by -k (176).
    Beginning with the realis conjugation as the default, all consonants and vowels used
for the irrealis form are “shifted” back one point of articulation – apical becomes
laminal, velar becomes uvular, ˙ becomes a, and u becomes o (see fn. 25). In such cases
the irrealis morpheme is a kind of autosegmental harmony process which spreads across
the whole of the root affecting all consonants and vowels. Following are examples:
    (172)      FIRST PERSON
               a. REALIS
                    tsi ts-˙g-˙n

    In contrast to the mutating Class I verbs, the realis–irrealis distinction in the majority
of Class I verbs is marked by affixation patterns. Following are examples of irrealis
forms marked by the affixes -du (for singular) and -dak (for plural):
    (174)      REALIS                                   IRREALIS

        Whatever the original function of ‘mutation’ may have been, it shows evidence of having later
been morphologized to operate in several grammatical systems, not restricted to the realis–irrealis
distinction alone. In some transitivity diathesis alternations, for example, the marked parameter is
marked by mutation, as in: dzu≥-dzi ‘It hangs’ vs. mutated dzoˆ-a-dzi ‘He hung it.’ See also sections
§8.4, §9.2.1, §9.3.4, and §9.3.8 for the ‘mutating’ pattern in subordination.
        Though such marking systems are rare in the languages of the world, similar phenomena have
been reported in isolated cases. Jim Watters (1987) reports that in Tlachichilco Tepehua, a Totonacan
language of Mexico, second person subject agreement in verbs is marked by glottalizing all glottalizable
consonants – p, t, ts, ch, k, and q become p’, t’, ts’, ch’, k’, and , respectively.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"
"5.5.5.2.    Transitive imperatives
    Transitive imperatives are much more regular than their intransitive counterparts.
Most transitive imperatives are fashioned after the imperative of the verb ‘to make, to
do,’ whose root form is ˙- or a-. The morpheme ˙-go transfers across to (almost) all
transitive imperatives, as in the following sample:
    (198)     a.   bem ˙-go              ‘Trip him!’
              b.   pumba ˙-go            ‘Beat him!’
              c.   d~aba ˙-go            ‘Find it!’
              d.   kisa ˙-go             ‘Cut it!’
              e.   unda ˙-go             ‘Show it!’
              f.   hab˙ ˙-go             ‘Roast it!’
              g.   t˙mb˙ ˙-go            ‘Send it!’
              h.   borl˙ ˙-go            ‘Boil it!’
              i.   dzaÚ ˙-go             ‘Buy it!’
              j.   abi ˙-go              ‘Carry it!’
              k.   toba ˙-go             ‘Sew it!’
    Because most transitive verbs take the syntactic form of a “light verb” (i.e. some
nominal notion plus the semantically empty verb ‘to do’), many such verbs are intransitive
in force, as in the following:
    (199)     a.   imba ˙-go             ‘Think!’
              b.   nikæe ˙-go            ‘Laugh!’
              c.   lol˙ ˙-go             ‘Cry out!’
              d.   ya≥ ˙-go              ‘Defecate!’
              e.   an ˙-go               ‘Urinate!’
   An exception to the generalization that transitive imperatives are fashioned after the
verb ‘to do’ is in the case of Class I verbs – those with prefixed person marking. In
such cases the imperative verb is conjugated for second person. This phenomenon is                                            77
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––much more common in intransitive verbs, as can be seen in §5.5.6.1. We have a single
example in transitive verbs:
    (200)      n-ukan2 9         ‘Know it!’ / ‘Figure it out!’5.5.6.      Prohibitives
     Prohibitives, both transitive and intransitive, are marked by the suffix -in (allomorphs
-en, -˙n, -yin) following the verb root. As with imperatives, most (but not all) transitive
prohibitives are built on the prohibitive form of the verb ‘to do, make’ – ˙-yin ‘Don’t do
it!’ Following are examples:
    (201)      a.   bem ˙-yin               ‘Don’t trip him!’
               b.   pumba ˙-yin             ‘Don’t beat him!’
               c.   d~aba ˙-yin             ‘Don’t allow it!’
               d.   kisa ˙-yin              ‘Don’t cut it!’
               e.   unda ˙-yin              ‘Don’t show it!’
               f.   hab˙ ˙-yin              ‘Don’t roast it!’5.5.6.1.    Intransitive and transitive Class I prohibitives
    Intransitive prohibitives and Class I prohibitives are simpler than those illustrated in
(201) in that they occur without the “helping” verb ‘to do, make.’ In addition, with
Class I verbs (see (202–203)), the root is preceded by the second person pronominal
prefix n-. (Note that the pronominal prefix also occurs potentially on transitive imperatives,
though only a single example has been found – ‘Know it!’ (see (200).)
    (202)      CLASS I INTRANSITIVES (includes pronominal prefix):

                  jump-PROH                   ‘Don’t jump!’
    A strange alternative set is available for the forms in (202) which, on the surface,    29
        This form is identical with second person realis n-uk-an (2-know-REAL). First person realis is
t-ukan, and third person ukan-dzi.","[77, 78]"

10. Clause chaining
    “Clause chaining” is a clause combining strategy very common in the languages of
South Asia and syntactically distinct from English-type “co-ranking” structures like He
went to the forest and set traps. A basic feature common to classical clause chaining
languages is the distinction between chain-medial and chain-final verbs. Typically, the
verb belonging to the chain-final clause is the most finite, being marked for things like
person/number agreement and tense/aspect distinctions. Verbs belonging to chain-medial
clauses, on the other hand, are less finite, sometimes pared down to a simple verb root
plus some kind of non-final marker. Thus, it is termed “co-subordinate.” It is
subordinate in that it depends on the final verb for certain finite specifications, but
coordinate in that it lacks many features of true subordinates (Haspelmath 1995).
    With respect to clause chaining, Kusunda is typologically distinct from the languages
immediately surrounding it. First of all it distinguishes on a temporal scale between
“sequential” events and “overlapping” events, and secondly, it marks sequential events
as “co-ranking” and overlapping events as “co-subordinate.” In the surrounding
languages, like Nepali and Kham, there is no formal distinction between sequential and
overlapping events, and the only strategy employed is the co-subordinate one.","[124, 125]"

                 he/she go-IRR-NEG
                 ‘He/she did not go.’
    Unlike the non-mutating verbs, here we see a distinction between the singular and
plural forms of the negative – distinct plural forms occur in (187b) and (187d). Parsing
the forms, however, is far from transparent. From (141) we saw that the plural forms for
‘go’ involve a vowel change in the verb root from ˙ to i. We also saw from (150–152)
that plurality is regularly marked by -da. In (187b) and (187d) both processes occur –
thus -id- is glossed as ‘go:PL’.
    Note, too, that the negative in third person uses an -i suffix in place of the -u suffix.
The negative -i occurs also in other persons, but it seems to be more prevalent in third
person contexts. We do not know if there is an implied semantic distinction between -i
and -u. This problem will require more study. One possibility that suggests itself is
that -i and -u are somehow related to the existential and locative copulas (see §6.1).
There may be evidential distinctions here.","[73, 74]"
"6.1.1.1         Negative equative
   The negative equative copula is odoq, which can occur virtually anywhere the zero
copula occurs. The negative of (226b) and (226d), for example, is as follows:
       (227)      a. na gimi       tsi-yi odoq
                     this money I-GEN is.not
                     ‘This money is not mine.’
                                              85
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Basic clause types
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––             b. na tsi kila-d-ßn        gimi      odoq
                this I steal-1-REAL money is.not
                ‘This is not money that I stole.’
    We have recorded a few cases in which the equative copula (Ø or odoq) occurs with
adjectives, an environment in which one might expect the “predicate adjective” copula.
Of course, the predicate adjective copula does occur in this environment (as in na
pæurlu≥ tsu ‘This is red’; see example (237a) below), but where the equative occurs, the
implication is that one particular item is chosen from among many as having the relevant
feature – ‘This one is long’ or ‘This is the long one.’ In effect, the adjective is rendered
as a nominal. This is similar to what occurs in Nepali and other languages of the region,
like Kham. In Kusunda, however, because the positive construction is verbless, it is
more difficult to determine the correct interpretation in that context:
   (228)     a. na li≥wa Ø
                this heavy (copula)
                ‘This one is heavy’ / ‘This is the heavy one.’
             b. na l˙≥ka odoq
                this long is.not
                ‘This one is not long’ / ‘This is not the long one.’
    There is still a possibility that we have interpreted (228a) incorrectly. Perhaps
adjectives are “verbal” enough in their semantics that they can be used as simple
predicators, in which case (228a) should be interpreted to mean ‘This is heavy.’ Given,
however, that the negative equative is possible here, we are assuming that the adjective in
the verbless construction, too, is functioning as a nominal.","[85, 86]"

"6.1.1.2    An equative copula
   There is an equative copula b˙t, which is in some ways the positive counterpart of the
negative equative described above. However, the copula b˙t occurs only rarely, and there
may be pragmatic constraints on its use. Following are examples:
   (229)     a. tsi b˙t
                I    equative
                ‘It’s me.’
             b. tsi mo≥ b˙t

                this cook-ADJ meat            equative
                ‘This is cooked meat.’
    Note that in (229b) the implication is similar to what we described for (228a) – the
referent is singled out from among many – ‘I am the one who is king,’ not just ‘I am a
king.’ Likewise, the equative copula b˙t can also occur with adjectives, in which case the
adjective functions as a nominal:
   (230)     tsi h~ukui     b˙t
             I    small     equative
             ‘I am a small/unimportant (person).’ / Not *I am small.

"   • Refusal. Negatives with a strong component of “refusal” sometimes mark the
pronoun twice on the verb – the old prefixed form and a newer suffixed form, as in:
    (191)      tsi t-˙m-wa-tsi
               I 1-eat-NEG:IRR-1
               ‘I won’t eat it.’5.5.4.5.     Negative perfect
   Another aspectual category is the negative perfect, translated as ‘not yet.’ It is
formed by suffixing a pronominal copy at the end of the realis negative verb, as in:
    (192)      a. tsi t-˙m-daÚ u-tsi
                  I 1-eat-REAL:NEG-1S

   There are a large number of irregular, suppletive forms for marking the imperative,
especially in old, high frequency verbs (e.g. see (197)), and each has to be learned
separately. Still, most verbs follow regular patterns and we will deal with those first.",[75]

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    It also becomes more clear under negation that the distinction between realis and
irrealis is, in fact, not related to “real” and “not real,” but is more closely related to
“actual” and “possible.” Thus realis affirmative statements assert something to be
factual, and irrealis affirmative statements assert something to be possibly true. In the
negative, “realis” asserts as true that something did not happen (or is not happening),
while irrealis asserts that even possible truth is not likely to become fact.","[71, 72]"
"5.5.4.1.    Negative realis in Class II verbs
     Negative realis-assertion is marked by a suffix -aÚu, with pharyngealization on the
first vowel and falling–rising pitch on the full sequence.2 6 (See also §6.1.2.2 Negative
existential.)
     As in the affirmative, the affixation type of person markers (i.e. prefixing or suffixing)
affects other affixation patterns as well. Thus, recall from (153–155) that with fully
contrastive prefixed person markers in the affirmative (Class I verbs) the only distinction
marked by suffixes is the number distinction. The suffix -du, then, marks singular
actant for first, second, and third persons, while -dak marks plural actants. In Class II
verbs -d is separated off as a first person marker.
     In Class II negative verbs, too, -d (along with -n and -g) belongs to the person
marking system and not to the negative suffix. Note, too, that in the negative there is no
marking in the verb to distinguish between singular and plural actants. Such information
is signalled by the free pronoun. Following is a Class II negative–realis paradigm:
    (184)      CLASS II — NEGATIVE–REALIS:

    As already alluded to, Class I verbs mark negative realis in all persons with the
suffix -daÚu. In Class II verbs, of course, we have already seen repeatedly that -d is a
person marker – first person negative is -d-aÚu, second person is -n-aÚu, and third
person is -g-aÚu. In Class I verbs, the -d has become part of the negative suffix.
Following is a Class I negative–realis paradigm:    26
        This suggests that the original sequence is something like -a)u, which interestingly, is
precisely the mutated form of -˙go, the imperative marker. Recall that the mutated form is related to
several marked structures – something also true of negation. (See §5.5.3.1 on Mutation.)

"4.4.4.     The velar and uvular series
    There are difficulties inherent in distinguishing the velar and uvular series of consonants,
and for that reason they will be discussed together. As with consonants in the apical
series, absolute points of articulation may vary slightly from one word to the next
according to the vowels which follow. Thus, for example, the phoneme /k/ can have
pre-velar and post-velar variants depending on whether the associated vowel is high-front
or low-back.
    Though there is good evidence for a contrast between velar and uvular consonants,
we have often found it difficult to distinguish between a post-velar [ßk] and a uvular [q],
especially because they commonly occur in identical contexts. Fortunately, the task of
distinguishing velar and uvular points of articulation is simplified in voiced consonants –
primarily because of the concomitant features of pharyngealization and lowering of
fundamental frequencies in the uvular series (see §4.3.2).
    There may be an aspirate series for uvular consonants, but we have so far been
unable to distinguish it clearly from a fricative series:                                               37

    The velar consonant [k] occurs in all contexts – syllable initial, syllable final, and
with any vowel. Its voiced counterpart [g] occurs in the same contexts except syllable
final. By contrast, the velar nasal consonant [≥] occurs only syllable finally. In this
respect, Kusunda differs noticeably from Tibeto-Burman languages in which nasal [≥] is
very common syllable initially. No word in Kusunda that we have found begins with
nasal [≥]. Following are examples of [k], [g], and [≥] in various contexts:

           g. [ye≥gu]                  ‘stone’   • Fricative variants for velar consonants. Intervocalically, it is common for ‘g’ to
occur as a fricative [©]. As in the labial and lingual series, a non-fricative [g] occurring
between vowels can be an indicator of underlying [k], as in (62d):
    (62)   a.   [a©˙i]                 ‘dog’
           b.   [d˙©˙i]                ‘he went’

           d.   [nigu] < *niku         ‘moon’
    In Kamala’s speech, the fricative is reduced even further, either to a very light
fricative, or to Ø, as in the following contrastive sets:

    It is difficult to determine if there is a velar fricative [x] in the data set. What sounds,
in many contexts, to be a fricative [x] also occurs with equal frequency as an aspirate
[kæ]. Given that velar sounds are often fricativized anyway, we are assuming that /kæ/,
because of its instability in a predictable direction, has a variant [x]. Following are
examples:
    (65)     a.   [kæaidzi]        ~     [xaidzi]                   ‘food’
             b.   [kæaÚ u]         ~     [xaÚ u] / [≈aÚ u]          ‘is not’

sometimes arises as a coalescence of anti-causative ‘q’ plus syllabic ‘n,’ which marks
realis, as in:
    (66)     a. h˙ra-q-ßn                    > h˙ra-≥
                open-AC-REAL                 > open-AC:REAL                ‘open’ (participle)
             b. gya-q-ßn                     > gya-≥
                collapse-AC-REAL             > collapse-AC:REAL            ‘collapsed’ (participle)   • Aspiration. We have twelve examples of [kæ], at least three of which have a
Nepali source, and one of which has a Kham or Magar source:
    (67)     a.   kæola           ‘stream’ < Nep.
             b.   lekæadßn        ‘write’ < Nep. lekhnu
             c.   kæurpa          ‘knife’ < Nep. khurpa; Kham, Magar khur ‘knife’

             l.   ukæ˙-           ‘ruin’
    We have five examples of [gæ], one of which is Nepali, and another which is likely
from Nepali. The word in (68d) shows up in the Reinhard and Toba data as gihan,1 1

    The uvular consonants [q], [ ], and [ˆ] contrast with the velar consonants [k], [g],
and [≥]. We have already commented that velar and uvular points of articulation are
more easily distinguished in the voiced series for the simple reason that voiced uvular
consonants are accompanied by other phonetic indicators – pharyngealization and a
lowering of fundamental frequencies on preceding vowels.
    As far as we can tell, no word begins with [ ], though numerous words begin with
[q]. [G] occurs as an interovcalic phenomenon. This fact by itself would lead us to
believe that [q] and [ ] are in complementary distribution. There are, however, cases of
[q] also occurring intervocalically, as in the following contrastive pair:
    (69)     a. [yaqa]          ‘porcupine’
             b. [ya o]          ‘cold (weather)’
     The problem we run into here is similar to the problem we have seen with other
consonants – voiceless consonants, intervocalically, frequently surface as voiced sounds
(see §4.4.1). With labial consonants we were able to say that intervocalic [b] is an
underlying [p], and intervocalic [∏] is an underlying [b]. The solution is not so simple
here. [G], in our data, never surfaces as an actual stop. Rather, it is sometimes
articulated with a certain amount of fricativization, as in [Ù], but more often as a pharyn-
gealized approximant [ ].
     In our early transcriptions, we wrote [ ] as [h] or [÷];1 2 later we began to realize that
the sound had an anticipatory “glottal” or “pharyngeal” quality, and we experimented
with [h] preceded by pharyngealization on the vowel. As we collected more data we
began to detect distinct pharyngeal stricture during the production of the consonant, and
though the sound is phonetically closer to [ ] than anything else, we are interpreting the
sound, within the larger system, as [ ]. The caveat is that cardinal [ ] does not occur,
and we will write the sound in our text examples as / /, (indicating pharyngealization,
realized especially on the preceding vowel).","[39, 40]"

    Verbs are marked for the person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or

     The verbs ‘eat’ and ‘sleep’ are the most regular of the four verbs shown in (141)
and will serve as our starting point. The first element, a prefix, is t-/ts-, n-, or g-
according to whether the actant is first, second, or third person, respectively. The forms
are clearly based on the shape of the free pronouns tsi ‘I,’ nu ‘you,’ and gina ‘he, she,
it.’ The determination of first person ts- vs. t- is purely lexical and cannot be determined
by rule – phonological, grammatical, or otherwise.
     Other Class I verbs with first person ts- are the following: ts-oˆ-˙n ‘I drank,’
ts-o)-on ‘I put,’ etc. Other Class I verbs with first person t- are the following:
t-o)-˙n ‘I died,’ t-uk-an ‘I knew,’ etc.
     With the third verb, ‘come,’ the pronominal agreement forms are t-, n-, or Ø, and
with the final verb, ‘go,’ the forms are ts-, n-, and (seemingly) d-. In the latter case,
however, though d- possibly fills a person slot in the synchronic grammar, historically it
is the first element of the root and still surfaces in certain forms like the imperative – da
‘Go!’ D- as a third person marker, then, can be discounted on historical grounds.
     Again, as in first person ts- vs. t-, the determination of third person g- vs. Ø is lexical
and cannot be determined by rule. Other Class I verbs with third person Ø- are the
following: o)-˙n ‘he died,’ uk-an-dzi ‘he knows,’ etc. Many others take g-.
     Class I verbs are generally messy, with many irregular and suppletive forms. This is
very likely a consequence of their considerable age and maintained by high frequency

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––usage. A case in point are the plural forms for ‘go’ – ts-i÷-da-n ‘I went’ and n-i÷-da-n
‘You went.’ The vocalism [i] in the plural root [i÷] cannot be explained in the synchronic
grammar and nothing of the original root da remains. We end up with a suppletive
form.2 4
    Another irregular verb is the verb ‘sit,’ with first person s-, second person ¯-, and
third person h-, as in the following:
    (142)        1s    s-~aˆ an           ‘I sit.’
                 1p    s-~aˆ an           ‘We sit.’
                 2s    ¯-~aˆ an           ‘You sit.’
                 2p    ¯-~aˆ an           ‘You [pl] sit.’
                 3s    h-~aÚdzi           ‘He/she sits.’
                 3p    h-~aÚdei           ‘They sit.’
    It is possible that the underlying root in this case has an /h/ onset. The /h/ emerges
also in the imperative, as in: h~aˆ-no ‘Sit!’5.5.1.2.    Suffixing patterns (Class II)
    In contrast to Class I verbs, Class II verbs are characterized by person marking
suffixes. The majority of verbs in Kusunda belong to this class.","[59, 60, 61]"
"11.1    Coordination
    Where the person reference in both verbs of a co-ranking structure is identical we
get something equivalent to coordination, especially where there is also continuity of
time reference between the two verbs. We looked briefly at coordination in §10.1, but
there we were contrasting it with co-subordinate strucures; here we contrast coordination
with other co-ranking structures. Following are examples of coordination, translated by
English ‘and’:
    (359)     a. wa     u-g-i         ip-dzi
                 home come-3-PAST sleep-3:PAST
                 ‘He came home and slept.’
              b. hyoq-ts-in     ts-ip-ßn
                 hide-1-REAL 1-sleep-REAL
                 ‘I hid and slept.’
    Thus, though in Kusunda, the person and number of the subject is marked on both
verbs, their English translations elide the second pronominal reference, as in: He came
home and slept. The same Kusunda sentences could also be translated as, for example,
‘He came home, he slept’ or ‘He came home and he slept.’ Subject continuity allows,
but does not require, the elided translations given in (359). (The sentences were originally
elicited as sequential chains using Nepali -er˙, hence, the same subject in both verbs and
their English translations.)    • The adversative. The adversative is based entirely on semantic inference. It has a
basic coordinate structure, but one in which the second event of the bi-clausal structure
can be thought of as an unexpected outcome of the first event:

              I lie.down-1-REAL 1-sleep-REAL:NEG
              ‘I laid down, (but) I didn’t sleep.’

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––11.1.1      Discontinuity of person reference
    Where two verbs in a sequence are marked for different subjects, a disjunction of
events is implied by the two verbs in the co-ranking structure, as reflected in the following
translations (here the second pronoun cannot be elided):
    (361)     a. t˙n-da   un     unda-g-i        t-ug-un
                 me-ACC road show-3-PAST 1-come-REAL
                 ‘He showed me the road and I came.’
              b. nu n-ug-un            tsi hyoq-ts-in
                 you 2-come-REAL I         hide-1-REAL
                 ‘You came and I hid.’
    In examples (359–361) all verbs were cast in past time – either as realis or past
tense. In the following example both clauses are in future time, but with the same
discontinuity of person reference. Here, the second clause implies “reason”:
    (362)     t˙n-da    t˙mba-yin,       tsi un    meÚ-d-u
              me-ACC send-PROH, I road lose-1-IRR:SG
              ‘Don’t send me, I’ll lose the road.’11.1.2      Discontinuity of time
    Where one or both clauses are marked by adverbs of time, a disjunction of events is
implied, even where the pronominal reference for both events is identical. Again, there
are no explicit coordinators marking such predications; the relationship between the two
events must be inferred:
    (363)     SAME PRONOMINAL REFERENCE:
              a. tsi kæaidzi t-˙m-˙n,          d˙baq a-t-ßn         wi

                 ‘I ate food, now I’ll build the house.’
              b. tsi wi      a-t-ßn,           s˙mba ts-ip-ßn
                 I house make-1-REAL, later              1-sleep-REAL

                 ‘Yesterday I thought of you, today we met.’
    (364)     DIFFERENT PRONOMINAL REFERENCE:

                  ‘After you come I will eat.’ (lit. ‘You’ll come, I’ll eat later’)11.1.3      Discontinuity of TAM marking
    Where there is discontinuity of time (as in §11.1.2), there can also be an accompanying
discontinuity in TAM marking between the two verbs of the construction. The semantic
inference to be drawn in such cases is not different from the inferences we saw in (363)
and (364). In the following examples, the first verb is marked for realis or past, and the
second verb for irrealis:                                            135

between ‘how’ and ‘how much’ seems odd, although it occurs also in English.","[47, 48]"
"5.5.4.3.    Negative realis in mutating verbs
    All mutating verbs belong to Class I, i.e. person marking indices are prefixed to the
verb root. (But not all Class I verbs are mutating.) Significantly, negative realis in
mutating verbs employs mutation as part of its marking strategy, and the negative suffix
-u is added to the mutated root. Thus, both irrealis and negative are marked/mutated
patterns.
    (186)      a. REALIS            b. IRREALIS              c. NEGATIVE

                  2-go:REAL-IND        2-go:IRR-IND             2-go:IRR-NEG
                  ‘You went.’          ‘You are going.’         ‘You did not go.’
    Here we encounter a few clues about the composition of the more elaborate negative
suffixes. The most basic (and probably original) negative marker is a simple -u suffix
added to the marked form of a mutating verb – yielding -a)-u (as in 187a, c) and
phonetically yielding [-aÚ -u]. (See also Negative indefinite pronouns under §5.1.3.)
    Next, in Class II verbs, the slightly elongated form -aÚu follows person markers
yielding sequences like -d-aÚu for first person, -n-aÚu for second person, and -g-aÚu
for third person. Finally, in non-mutating Class I verbs, the modern realis negative
marker includes -d as part of the negative sequence – -daÚu for all persons (as in
185a–f). Mutation is part of the history of negation and occurs in both the simple and
in the more elaborated forms of the morpheme.2 7
    Following is a negative–realis paradigm for mutating verbs (illustrating the simplest
of the negative suffixes):

"     • The voicing contrast between [q] and [)]. There are a number of intransitive
verb roots which end in [q], which when causativized end up as [ ] sandwiched between
vowels. It is likely that the consonant in the causativized version is also an underlying
[q], now voiced in the new environment. However, we are not yet sure if voicing plays a
role in causativization, or in any other grammatical marking. Unusual contrasts, like the
contrast between velar [g] and uvular [ ] plays a role in TAM marking (see §5.5.3.1),
and until we are sure about voicing in causativization, we will err on the side of caution
and continue to write the intervocalic uvular as / / in causative contexts. Following are
examples:

make,’ as in: abi a-t-ßn (carry do-1-REAL) ‘I carry it.’ Some of the same verbs (but
apparently not all of them) can substitute the verb ‘to give’ in place of ‘to do.’ Where
this occurs, we get a benefactive reading, as in:

     The “teach” converbal employs the overlapping converbal marker -de, followed by
a finite form of the verb ‘to show.’ The following examples show that the verb ‘show’
is not in a sequential relationship with the preceding verb, but an overlapping relationship.
It implies teaching by example, ‘showing how’:

   We saw the periphrastic causative ‘send’ earlier in §9.2.2, but we are now in a
position to discuss it more fully. The ‘send’ causative contrasts with the ‘make’                                            132

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––causative in at least two ways. First of all, the ‘make’ causative is an implicative
causative, i.e. it implies that the embedded event also occurred. With the ‘send’ causative,
such an implication seems to be weaker (though we are not yet sure). Secondly, the
‘send’ causative employs the “overlapping converb” as part of its structure. (The
‘make’ causative did not.)
    The overlapping converb carries with it the implication that the two verbs in the
clause chain are at least partially continuous, both temporally and thematically. This
contrasts with a sequential interpretation, in which the initial verb-event occurs first and
the final verb-event later. These clauses are bitransitive with a hierarchical structure.
The accusative marked object is an object of the higher verb and the embedded object is
unmarked. Following are examples:
    (358)     a. tsi n˙n-da        wi      a-de       t˙mb˙-d-u
                 I     you-ACC house make-CNV send-1-IRR:SG

                 (not: ‘You built a house and sent him.’)
    Part of the force of the ‘send’ causative is captured in the English idiomatic expression
(from Shakespeare) She sent him packing, which means something like, ‘She made him
leave.’

11. Combinations of finite clauses
In §10 we looked at clause chains of two types – 1) those that code events which occur
in temporal sequence, and 2) those that code events in which there is some kind of
temporal or semantic overlap. There is a formal structural difference – the former are
“co-ranking” in structure, all verbs being finite (and hence equal in rank, Longacre
1985), and the latter are “co-subordinate,” making a distinction between medial verbs
(non-finite) and final verbs (finite).
    In this chapter we will look further at co-ranking structures – those clause combinations
in which both verbs are finite. These are clauses of coordination, of condition, of
adversity and concession. But because there are no explicit clause connectors, like
‘and’ or ‘but,’ in Kusunda, the semantic relationship between any two co-ranking
clauses is a matter of inference. This is not to say that the inferences are not dependent
on certain grammatical and pragmatic factors; they are. Two very broad factors that are
relevant to our study are 1) the level of continuity between clauses, and 2) the particular
TAM marking employed. Continuity between clauses implies conjunction, and disconti-
nuity implies disjunction. It also turns out that irrealis marking on the final clause of a
two-clause construction almost always implies a conditional construction.","[131, 132, 133, 134]"
"10.1.1     Negation in sequential chains
    One consequence of having finite marking on both verbs is their logical independence
of one another. Under negation, it appears (tentatively, at least) that the scope of the
negative applies only to the negated verb, something not necessarily true for classical
clause chaining languages. In classical clause chaining languages, negation on the final
verb can extend backwards to the medial verb as well, as in the following example from
Kham (Watters 2002:327):
   (343)      m˙d˙ cæokoraÚ o-d˙           ta-s˙-m~ï:h-si-c-yo
              wine beer         drink-NF PROH-CAUS-drunk-DETRANS-2P-IMP
              ‘Don’t get yourselves drunk drinking beer and wine!’
    The inference is that you should not drink and get drunk – drinking is also prohibited.
However, cause and effect must be semantically well integrated before the scope of
negation on the final verb extends back to include the medial verb. Unfortunately, our
corpus of data does not include examples of negative clause chains where the two events
can be thought of as semantically well integrated, and under such circumstances it is
impossible to know if the scope of the negative in semantically integrated events is more
inclusive than it is in semantically discontinuous events.",[126]

                   ‘I roasted meat in the fire.’
                b. INTRANSITIVE:

                   fire-IN 1-go-REAL burn-1-REAL
                   ‘I went into the fire and got burned.’
    The intransitive version, illustrated in (280b), is passive in force and must be translated
in English as ‘got burned.’7.2.3.2       A “functional” passive
    In §8.1 we will discuss verbs that occur without person marking – our so-called
“neutral” inflection. In subordinate structures like the “purposive” clause, neutral
inflection on the subordinated verb indicates an identity of person (same subject) with
the matrix verb, as in the following:
      (281)     tok hyoq-ßn       ts-i-da-n
                we hide-NEUT 1-go-PL-REAL
                ‘We went to hide.’
   In Class I verbs, however, it is not normally possible to be rid of all person marking
– person marking occurs as a prefix. In such cases, the most neutral inflection is a
generic third person prefix (see §8.1.3), as in the following verb used in a modifying
function:
      (282)     g-˙m-˙n      kæaidzi
                3-eat-REAL food
                ‘eaten food’ / ‘food eaten by (someone)’
    In like manner, independent verbs in coordinate structures (see §11.1) can be interpreted
as having passive force where the medial “passive” verb is inflected as a generic third
person and the final verb is specific for person, as in:
      (283)     pyana       hul˙-g-˙n,      t˙~îna t-˙m-˙n
                yesterday cook-3-REAL, today 1-eat-REAL
                ‘Yesterday it was cooked, today I’ll eat it.’
   Many third person realis forms, pronounced as -˙g˙n by Gyani Maiya, are pronounced
simply as -˙n by Kamala, as in (284). (On this topic see also sections §4.4.4.1,
examples (63–64), and §9.1.2,1.)

                yesterday cook-REAL, today 1-eat-REAL
                ‘Yesterday it was cooked, today I’ll eat it.’7.3       Reflexive
    The reflexive construction in Kusunda does not require detransitivizing morphology
in the verb, but relies on the reflexive pronoun gimdzi ‘self.’ The reciprocal uses the
same mechanism, but with two occurrences of the reflexive pronoun, as in:                                             104

                ‘They killed each other.’
    This is not to say that detransitivized constructions are not compatible with the
reflexive pronoun; they are. If, however, the speaker wishes to express that the agent
acted on him/herself, the construction requires a fully transitive verb, as in the examples
of (285). Used with intransitive constructions, inherent or derived, the reflexive pronoun
only signifies that the eventuality named by the verb happened without outside agency
(not that it acted upon itself):
   (286)     ANTICAUSATIVE WITHOUT REFLEXIVE PRONOUN:

                ‘I didn’t do it, the corn broke by itself.’
    The same reflexive pronoun is used to indicate exclusive ownership, in which case
the reflexive pronoun precedes the possessed item, as in:
   (287)     a. gina    gimdzi gimdzi wi-nu         t-ei-dzi
                he/she self      self    house-TO go-PL-TAM (?)

                                           105
8.         Morphology of subordinate structures
    Clauses which are subordinated or embedded in other structures – adnominals in
relative clauses, sentential complements, periphrastic causatives, purposive clauses and
the like – are cast in one of three basic construction types. In one, the verb is cast in a
“neutral” non-finite form without person marking; in another, the subordinated verb
root is marked by a suffix -da; and in a third type the subordinate verb is fully finite.
None of the structures appear to have any kind of nominalizing morphology, although it
might be argued that the presence of -da is sufficient evidence to assume some kind of
nominalization – -da is also an NP object marker (see §5.2.2.2).3 3
    Lack of nominalized structures makes Kusunda typologically exceptional. Languages
of the region, both Nepali and TB languages like Kham, nominalize all sorts of embedded
clauses, and in some TB languages there are multiple types of nominalization.
    Here we will explore the basic morphological structure of subordinate structures and
talk later (in §9) about how they function within hosting structures. Though presented
from different points of view, there will necessarily be some overlap.","[103, 104, 105, 106]"
"11.2.1      Continuity of person in irrealis mode
     Irrealis marking on the final verb of a bi-clausal construction can occur with or
without person continuity between the two clauses. The result in both cases is the same
– it implies condition. The following example, then, a conditional, contrasts with the
examples shown in (365):
    (366)      na t-˙m-da-n             t-o -da-k
               this 1-eat-PL-REAL 1-die-PL-IRR
               ‘If we eat this we will die.’11.2.2      Discontinuity of person in irrealis mode
    Disjunction of person in irrealis contexts for bi-clausal constructions can occur with
or without continuity in the TAM marking of the two verbs. In the following sections
we present both types.",[136]

    In fact, like many languages of the region, the same morpheme that marks accusative
also marks “dative recipient” in bitransitive clauses and the subject in “dative subject”
clauses. The grammatical category, then, marks the “terminus” of a causal chain, and
might be better termed an “endpoint.” Following are examples of both:
   (114)     DATIVE RECIPIENT:
             a. gina-Ø    t˙n-da haq t˙mb˙-g-˙n
                he-NOM I-DAT letter send-3-REAL
                ‘He sent me a letter.’
             DATIVE SUBJECT:
             b. t˙n-da ida≥      kæaÚ u
                I-DAT hunger is:not
                ‘I am not hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is not to me’)

                I-DAT tea 1-drink-REAL tasty seems
                ‘To me drinking tea is tasty.’
    Note that the verb form in (114a) is identical to the form in (113d) even though one
functions in a transitive clause and the other in a bitransitive clause. (114a) adds a
“secondary object” letter, and -da marks the animate “primary object,” a notional
indirect object (Dryer 1986).
    In (114b–c), -da marks the “dative subject,” a well established pattern both in
Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman languages of the region (with the exception of Kham,
one of Kusunda’s immediate neighbors). Reinhard and Toba show this structure
without a dative subject.
    It is not known what semantic or pragmatic parameters delimit the use of -da in
transitive clauses, but it is clear that animacy plays a big role. We have numerous cases
of inanimate objects being unmarked, as in:
   (115)     a. tsi wi        a-t-ßn
                I house make-1-REAL
                ‘I built a house’ / ‘I make houses.’
             b. gina ta≥     kola-g-i
                he    water draw-3-PAST
                ‘He drew water.’   • The object marker -da as a ‘purposive’ marker. What may be regarded as the
same morpheme -da also marks embedded clauses of purpose (glossed in the examples
                                           52

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––as PURP). Here too, the “endpoint” of the eventuality named by the matrix verb is the
semantic notion being marked. The embedded verb retains many of its finite features,
and will be treated more fully in §8.2.3. In the meantime, we present the following
examples:
    (116)      a. t-˙m-da       t-ug-un
                  1-eat-PURP 1-come-REAL

                  I house make-PURP want-1-REAL
                  ‘I want to build a house.’
   From the example in (116a) it is clear that the matrix verb need not be transitive to
warrant the felicitous use of -da. It is likely that the marker is more attuned to the
pragmatic notion of “endpoint” or “goal” than it is to the syntactic notion of transitive
“object.” Throughout this grammar we will continue to gloss -da as ACC, DAT, or
PURP, depending on its usage.","[51, 52, 53]"
"4.4.2.1.    Apical stops
     The following raw stop consonants occur in the apical series in Kusunda – [@t], [t],
[Ê], and [c] in the voiceless series, and [@d], [d], [Î], and [Ç] in the voiced series. The four
voiceless sounds are variants of an apical /t/ and the four voiced sounds are variants of
an apical /d/.
     The stop variants are not absolute, but phonological tendencies. The dental variant,
for example, tends to occur preceding high, front vowels; the alveolar variant in neutral
contexts preceding [e], [u], or [˙]; the retroflex variant preceding [o] or [a]; and the
palatal variant in harmony with uvular consonants, as in the following examples:
    (44)    DENTAL:
            a. [@tigi]              ‘our’
            ALVEOLAR:
            b. [teisa]              ‘here’
            c. [tu]                 ‘snake’
            d. [t˙m˙n]              ‘I ate’
            RETROFLEX:
            e. [Êa≥]                ‘water’
            f. [Êoba]               ‘sew’
            PALATAL:
            g. [coq] ~ [tok]        ‘we’
            h. [qocu]               ‘bird’    • Aspiration. We have already seen that aspiration has a marginal status in Kusunda.
This is true also for apical consonants. We have five examples of [tæ], three of which
are from Nepali:
    (45)    a.   tæal                       ‘plate’ < Nep.
            b.   tæ˙w˙                      ‘place’ < Nep. tæa~u
            c.   tæag˙n ye≥gu               ‘flint’ (lit. ‘striking stone’ < Nep. thoknu ‘strike’)
            d.   tæum˙n ye≥gu               ‘mortar’
            e.   witæu                      ‘slippery’
   We have six examples of [dæ], one of which is Nepali, and another which has a
possible Kham source:
    (46)    a. dæundi                       ‘fog’ < Nep.
            b. dæapa gipan                  ‘rhododendron’ (lit. dhapa flower; possibly
                                                from Kham, related to the Kham custom of
                                                young men [dhapa] wearing rhododendrons

            c. dæab˙-di                     ‘shut’                                                34

            f. dæya                           ‘old man’    • Intervocalic voicing. Stops in the apical series display some of the same characteristics
presented for stops in the labial series – primarily a tendency for intervocalic voicing.
Some words originally transcribed with intervocalic [d] have, under closer scrutiny and
more careful speech, been shown to have an underlying [t], as in the following:
    (47)    a. [n˙di]       ~       [n˙ti]       ‘who’
            b. [gid˙t]      ~       [git˙t]      ‘skin’
    As in the discussion following example (41), we suspect that in many places where
[d] occurs intervocalically, it is an underlying [t]. Our case would be stronger if we also
found [Ï] in environments analogous to the environment for [∏]. In fact, we have not
recorded [Ï] anywhere. (See §4.4.2.2 immediately below.)4.4.2.2.   Apical fricatives
    Only the apical fricative [s] occurs in our data set with contrastive status, although
[z] also occurs as an allophonic variant of voiced and voiceless affricates [dz] and [ts]
respectively. The phoneme /s/ has a palatalized variant [ ] which occurs preceding front
vowels, as in the following:
    (48)    [ ] variant:
            a. [ i en]              ‘rice (in field)’
            b. [o enti]             ‘girl’
            c. [ i≥ki]              ‘eagle’
    (49)    [s] variant:
            a. [supo]               ‘winnowing tray’ (Nep.)
            b. [s˙i]                ‘bear (the animal)’
            c. [sodzaq]             ‘greetings’
    The voiced counterpart of [ ], (i.e. [Ô]), occurs as a variant of [dz] or [ts] in intervocalic
environments in which the following vowel is [i] or [e]. It occurs only in “compressed”
or “contracted” speech, as in:
    (50)    a. [deiÔi]          <        [deidzi]             ‘firewood’
            b. [dui˙Ôe]         <        [dui getse]          ‘male human’4.4.2.3.   Apical affricates
    The apical affricates [ts] and [dz] occur commonly in our data set, tsi being the first
person singular pronoun, and -dzi being a frequently occurring aspectual marker. As
with fricatives, the affricates are palatalized before front vowels. Thus, first person tsi
occurs as [t i], and the aspectual marker -dzi occurs as [dÔi]. (We are viewing these as
allophonic variants in such environments, but there is also a possible contrastive [t ],
described in §4.4.3 and in the section on “mutation” – §5.5.3.1.)
    The two affricates commonly occur with other vowels, too, as in the following
examples:                                                  35
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Phonology
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    (51)    AFFRICATE TS:
            a. [tsu]              ‘to be (existential)’
            b. [ts˙g˙n]           ‘I went.’
            c. [tso on]           ‘I put.’
            AFFRICATE DZ:
            d. [dzugui]            ‘sickness’
            e. [dz˙g˙l]            ‘old woman’
            f. [dzoqto]            ‘soak’
    We have a only two cases of aspirated apical affricates. One of them appears to be
derived from Nepali, as in:
    (52)    a. tsæ~aÚ-d-i            ‘I tied it.’ < Nep. chan ‘hobble’
            b. dzæ˙m-dzi             ‘He weeps.’4.4.2.4.   Apical nasals
    In our discussion of apical consonants so far, palatal consonants have been treated
as an allophonic variant of a generic apical series which includes dental, alveolar, retroflex,
and palatal points of articulation. This is generally true for the apical nasal consonant /n/
as well, with a palatal variant [¯] preceding high, front vowels (analagous to the palatal
variants for the other apical consonants /t/, /d/, /s/, and /ts/). (We are viewing [¯] as an
allophonic variant of [n] in such environments, but there is also a possible contrastive
[¯], described in §4.4.3 and in the section on “mutation” – §5.5.3.1.)
    (53)    NON-PALATALIZED:
            a. [n˙ti]              ‘who’
            b. [numba]             ‘cow’
            PALATALIZED:
            a. [m˙¯¯i]             ‘many’
            b. [~oÚ¯i]             ‘big’    • Syllabic ‘n’. In our data set, the resonant consonant ‘n’ occurs very frequently
with its own syllabic status, in which case it is written as [ßn]. Syllabic ‘n’ is usually
preceded by a stop consonant, but there are also cases where it is preceded by [n].
Following are examples:
    (54)    a. abi-a-t-ßn
               carry-do-1-REAL           ‘I carried it.’
            b. bal-ßn

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––4.4.3.     The laminal series
     Laminal consonants are formed by the blade of the tongue against the palate, in
contrast to the tip of the tongue in apical consonants. Apart from the palatal glide or
semi-vowel /y/ (see §4.4.5), the only laminal consonants are /¯/ and /t /, both somewhat
difficult to justify. As we have just seen in example (53), [¯] can occur as a variant of
/n/, but there are some minimal environments that dispose us to treat it as a separate
phoneme. One such environment is where it “harmonizes” with a following uvular
cosonant, as in:
    (55)    a. [¯~aˆdi]            ‘wife’
            b. [¯aqtsin]           ‘I wait.’
    Though it might be possible to write the laminal as a simple /n/ and rely on the
following uvular consonant to trigger the appropriate variant [¯], the fact is that in certain
grammatical environments the palatalization of both ‘n’ and ‘ts’ is part of a larger
autosegmental “mark” that spreads vocalic and consonantal harmony across the entire
word. Thus, in the following example, [n˙g˙n] and [¯a an] are realis and irrealis forms,
respectively, of the same verb, as are also [ts˙g˙n] and [t a an], as in:
    (56)    a. [n˙g˙n]             ‘You went.’
            b. [¯a an]             ‘You will go.’
            c. [ts˙g˙n]            ‘I went.’
            d. [t a an]            ‘I will go.’
   The phoneme [¯] also occurs in at least one environment where it is unpredictable
and contrasts with [n], as in:
    (57)    a. [na]                ‘this’
            b. [¯~aÚ ˙di]          ‘I removed it’
    This particular contrast is somewhat suspect and may, in fact, turn out to be [¯~aˆ
˙di].","[34, 35, 36, 37]"
"9.1.2.2     Levels of transitivity in adnominal modifiers
    There can be various levels of transitivity in adnominals derived from verbs. The
most transitive are those with fully finite transitive verbs (315e), and the least transitive
are those with Class II intransitive verbs where S equals O (315a). (Not all transitive
verbs have a Class II intransitive counterpart as the following verb does.) It will be
easier to describe transitivity levels (a), (b), and (c) by using Nepali equivalents in
addition to English. We begin with the least transitive:
    (315)     a. yo-˙n       amba
                 cook-REAL meat
                 ‘cooked meat’ / Nep. ‘pakeko masu’ (intransitive)
              b. hol-di    amba
                 cook-ADJ meat
                 ‘cooked meat’ / Nep. ‘pakeko masu’ (intransitive)
                 ‘cooking meat’ / Nep. ‘p˙kaune masu’

                 ‘meat that has been cooked (by s.o)’
                 Nep. ‘p˙kaeko masu’ (transitive)
              d. hul˙-g-˙n    amba
                 cook-3-REAL meat
                 ‘cooked meat’ / ‘meat cooked by someone’ / ‘meat cooked by
                 him’

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Syntax of subordinate structures
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––                e. hul˙-d-ßn      amba
                   cook-1-REAL meat
                   ‘meat that I cooked’
    The verb in (315a) is a suppletive intransitive form of the verb ‘to cook’ and always
implies intransitivity with S equalling O. The -di form in (315b) is an adjectival form
that is available to only a few transitive verbs. The form in (315c) is a neutral form, used
primarily by Kamala and derived from an earlier third person generic form. It is
transitive, but with no agent in view. The third person generic form is given in (315d).
It can also be a specific third person form. The form in (315e) is a first person form
which is never used in a generic sense, and implies full transitivity.
    It is instructive to contrast the ‘cook’ verb above with another verb whose intransitive
semantics implies that S equals A. The Kusunda verb for ‘hide’ is such a verb.
Furthermore, the inherent form of the verb is intransitive. (For ‘cook’ there are two
inherent forms – an intransitive yo- and a transitive hol-.) With ‘hide,’ because S equals
A, the intransitive adnominal must modify an animate noun, as in:
    (316)       a. hyoq-ßn      amba
                   hide-REAL animal
                   ‘hidden / hiding animal’
                b. *hyoq-ßn   gimi
                   *hide-REAL money
    Our informants’ explanation for the ungrammaticality of (b) is “because money
cannot hide itself.” Thus, where there is no inherent O intransitive verb, the passive
adnominal must be formed off the causativized version of the verb, and the only “passive”
form available to such verbs is Kamala’s “neutral” form or Gyani Maiya’s “generic
third person” form:
(317)       a. Kamala:
               hyo -a-˙n             gimi
               hide-CAUS-REAL        money
               ‘hidden money’
            b. Gyani Maiya:
               hyo -a-g-˙n          gimi
               hide-CAUS-3-REAL     money
               ‘hidden money’ (by someone)
     This contrasts sharply with those forms that are inherently transitive and are detransi-
tivized by anti-causative derivation, like the forms in (312).","[115, 116]"
"10.1    Sequential events
    Sequential events occur in temporal chronology – Having eaten he left is an example;
eating occurs first and leaving second. Kusunda has such sequences, but all verbs in the
chain – medial and final – are fully finite. Furthermore, medial verbs have no special
marker to distinguish them from final verbs. As such, these are “co-ranking” structures
(Longacre 1985) and differ from the “co-subordinate” structures we will look at in
§10.2. Following are examples:
   (342)     a. hyoq-ts-in       ts-ip-ßn
                hide-1-REAL 1-sleep-REAL
                ‘I hid and I slept.’ (I hid and slept.)

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Clause chaining
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    All of the sequences above retain the same subject for both verbs and would occur in
other languages of the region as classic clause chains – the first verb would occur as a
non-finite medial verb (plus linking morphology), and only the final verb would occur as
fully finite with person inflection. English, too, would treat all the sentences in (342) as
“same-subject” chains by deleting the second pronoun — ‘You hid and you slept.’
    The kinds of sequences illustrated in (342) are not formally different from the
coordinated structures we will look at in §11.1. The only difference, if any, might be
based on semantic inferences. The structures here were elicited as sequential chains
(using Nepali -er˙), while the structures in §11.1 were elicited as non-chains like After I
eat I will go.","[125, 126]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––5.1.4.      Demonstrative pronouns
    As far as we can tell, there are only two demonstrative pronouns in Kusunda – na
and ta. The distinction does not appear to be deictic, as in the usual “proximate” and
“distal” distinctions in both IA and TB languages of Nepal. Rather, the distinction
appears to be based on animacy, na being an animate demonstrative, and ta an inanimate
demonstrative. Here we repeat the examples in (101):
    (105)      a. n˙ti na
                  who this (animate)      ‘Who is this?’
               b. n˙ti ta
                  what this (inanimate)   ‘What is this?’
     Unfortunately, this generalization breaks down in many contexts, and the two terms
seem to be interchangeable, as in na pæurlu≥ tsu ‘This is red’ to refer to an inanimate
object. It is possible that na is the functionally unmarked member of the two.
     We are not aware of a way, using demonstrative pronouns, to distinguish between
‘this’ and ‘that.’ However, the third person pronoun sometimes occurs as a demonstrative,
and in that function appears to express a distal demonstrative ‘that’:
   (106)       gina k˙l˙m gina-yi
               that pen         he-GEN
               ‘That pen is his.’
    There are no plural demonstrative pronouns. Plurality in pronouns, like plurality in
nouns, can be marked in the NP by numerals or quantifiers, or by plural agreement
affixes in the verb. (See also §5.2.1.)5.2.     Nouns and noun morphology
    All nouns in Kusunda, as far as we currently know, have the same morphosyntactic
properties. The class is composed of prototypical nouns, concrete kinds of things that
can be manipulated and counted. Though they can be counted, none of them can be
pluralized. There is no nominal plural marker. This sets them apart from pronouns,
which we saw in §5.1.
    Another class of words that might be called “nominal” (though not so in this
grammar) are “action nouns.” This is a highly restricted class and occurs only in
constructions as a complement of the verb ‘to do’ – notions like ‘to do thinking’ or ‘to
do hitting.’ More than half of the verbs in Kusunda are formed from such elements.
Rather than referring to them as “nouns” in light verb constructions, however, we will
refer to them as “non-inflecting verbs.” They require the presence of an auxiliary verb
‘to do, make’ to carry the appropriate inflection. More investigation needs to be done
on their properties. (See §6.1.4.)
    In §5.2.2.3 we give some evidence, still weak, for a possible “locational” subclass
of nouns.","[48, 49]"
"9.2.1         Implicative causative – “make”
    The implicative causative is a complement verb structure whose matrix verb is the
verb ‘to make.’ The embedded verb is coded in much the same way as the clauses we
saw in §8.1 and §8.2 – either as “neutral” or finite (or as a mutating structure as we
saw in §8.4). There is, however, none of the -da encoding we saw on “purposive”
clauses. Following are neutral forms:
                                               118

                  ‘I got my friend to fight.’
    The following embedded forms are finite, realis mode. We do not seem to have any
examples of the embedded form in past tense. Whether it is possible or not needs to be
verified.
    (325)      a. t˙n-da   wi      a-t-ßn     ˙-g-i
                  me-ACC house make-1-REAL make-3-PAST
                  ‘He made me build a house.’

                  he-ACC dance-3:REAL make-1-PAST
                  ‘I made him dance.’
    In an unexpected twist, the embedded form of “mutating” verbs (see §5.5.3.1) is
the irrealis form, something that needs to be accounted for (we broached this topic first
in §8.4). In Class II verbs, like the verb in (325a), the form of the embedded verb is
realis (which is what one would expect for an implicative verb). Irrealis would seem to
imply a non-implicative status for the embedded verb.
    Earlier (see fn. 25, 26), we noted that the mutating pattern very likely originated in an
old “marked–unmarked” distinction and was later morphologized in various systems.
The marked modality is irrealis, the marked polarity is negative, and here, the marked
dependency is dependent. In the “permissive” construction (see §9.3.4) we will see the
pattern again.

     The “send causative” uses, as its matrix verb, a transitive verb which means ‘send’
in its literal sense. The embedding structure, however, is something we have not yet
encountered, and will not properly discuss until §10.1, and specifically in §10.2.5. We
introduce it here simply as an “overlapping converb.” Following are two examples:
    (327)      a. gina t˙n-da      wi       a-de     t˙mb˙-g-u
                  he   me-ACC house make-CNV send-3-IRR:SG

                    you him-ACC house make-CNV send-2-PAST
                    ‘You got him to build a house.’
    The causative use of ‘send’ contrasts with the literal sense of ‘send’ through the
complementation type used. With literal ‘send,’ the complement is cast as a “purposive”
clause, as in:
      (328)      tsi gin-da       am-da     t˙mb˙-d-i
                 I    him-ACC eat-PURP      send-1-PAST
                 ‘I sent him to eat.’
    This latter sense of ‘send’ is non-implicative; it does not imply that the event named
by the embedded verb occurred.","[118, 119, 120]"
"5.2.2.3.    Local case markers
     In our data set, only three locative case markers have emerged. Reinhard and Toba
list more, though some of them are suspect. The so-called “preposition” inside, for
example, given as gem˙t, is very likely the word for ‘stomach.’2 1
     None of the locative case markers appear to be obligatory, especially if the semantic
connection is sufficiently understood by the collocation of the verb and the locational
noun. This may constitute some evidence for a separate “locational” subclass of nouns
(see §5.2).
    (117)      a. goraq      tsi da≥      t -a -an
                  tomorrow I      Dang 1-go-IRR
                  ‘Tomorrow I will go to Dang.’

                  bag     3-put-REAL
                  ‘He put it in the bag.’    • The locative -da. The marker -da, discussed in §5.2.2.2 as an accusative, marks
at least one other kind of relationship, a locative one. The marker occurs rarely, but
seems to occur almost obligatorily on the word for ‘road’2 2 and also commonly on the
word for ‘forest.’
    (118)      a. un-da        myaq       p˙rm˙-d-i      qæai-tsi-n
                  road-LOC leopard meet-1-PAST afraid-1-REAL
                  ‘I met a leopard on the road and was frightened.’    21
       The word for stomach can, of course, serve as a ‘relator noun’ for inside in the same way that
the word for buttocks in our data serves as a relator noun for behind. Very likely it is a kind of noun.
See §5.3.
    22
        It appears possible that the frequent combination un ‘road’ and -da ‘locative’ may be the source
for the verb ‘to show’ unda a-d-i [show do-1-PAST] ‘I showed it.’                                                  53

   Notice that in (118b), -da occurs twice. In its second occurrence it marks what
appears to be an inanimate object – ‘road.’ In fact, we are interpreting it as a locative
marker. Recall that -da is obligatory on most occurrences of ‘road.’
   Comparing locative -da with locative -ga (following), the distinction may be that -da
marks distal, diffuse locations, while -ga marks nearby, specific locations.","[53, 54]"
"    • The comitative. The comitative marks a notion of association, or doing an action
with another actant, as in the following:
   (123)     gina-ma     tsi ts-˙g-˙n
             he-WITH I       1-go-REAL
             ‘I went with him.’
   As in most other languages of the region, the comitative also marks possession, as in
‘With me is one rupee’ meaning ‘I have one rupee.’
   (124)     tsi-ma    qasti tsi/tsu
             I-WITH one is
             ‘I have one.’ (lit. ‘with me is one’)
    The language is ambivalent in how it interprets -ma. As a location, it collocates with
the locational copula tsi. As a possessive, it collocates with the existential copula tsu.
    In “reciprocal” kinds of verbs, -ma marks the reciprocal actant. Such verbs, mor-
phologically, behave like intransitives, as in:
   (125)     tsi gina-ma       limu-tsi-n
             I     he-WITH     fight-1-REAL
             ‘I fought with him.’
   There is at least one bitransitive verb in Kusunda in which -ma marks the “source.”

               I-WITH money beg-3:PAST 3-go-PAST
               ‘He begged money from me and left.’ (lit. ‘with me’)    • The “benefactive”. What we refer to here as the “benefactive” is a case marker
that occurs on NPs without concomitant valence adjusting modifications on the verb.
For details on the latter kind of benefactive construction, see §10.2.3. Here, the benefactive
case marker is based on the Nepali ko lagi, as in the following:
       (127)   tsi-lage limu-dzi
               I-FOR fight-3:PAST
               ‘He fought for me.’    • Comparative. The comparative in Kusunda is based on the Nepali bæ˙nda, as in
the following:
       (128)   na bæ˙nda ~oˆ ˙n o -da-n
               this than       big     come-PL-REAL
               ‘Bigger than this come.’ (in reference to mosquitos)    • Instrumental. It seems strange that we have been unable to elicit an instrumental
marker. All attempts have yielded nothing. Reinhard and Toba list a morpheme -ya as
the instrumental. Following is an example of the lack of an instrumental:
       (129)   na kæurpa-Ø kis˙-g-˙n
               this knife         cut-3-REAL
               ‘This is cut by a knife.’ / ‘(He) cut this with a knife.’
    (See §8.1 for the “neutral” conjugation of this verb – something that yields an
intransitive reading.)5.3.       Locative postpositions
    Most locative postpositions are specialized nouns that specify some kind of location
– notions like ‘on top of,’ ‘beside,’ etc. Some have referred to such nouns as “relator
nouns” (Starosta 1985; Watters 2002). Where these nouns still function elsewhere in
the grammar as full nouns with their original, literal sense, their nominal source is
transparent. In other cases, the word ceases to function as a full noun, and serves only
in a locative function.
    A transparent case of a noun serving as a postposition is the word for ‘behind,’
s˙mba derived from s˙mba ‘buttocks.’ (See fn. 21.) The word has a temporal function,
too, meaning ‘after’ or ‘later.’
    That many such words are basically nouns can be shown by the fact that they are
capable of supporting the genitive or the locative case marking suffixes shown in §5.2.2.
Thus, for example, a~o ‘inside’ and b~adza ‘outside’ can take the ablative in the same way
that ‘house’ can take the ablative. Thus, we can get:
       (130)   a. a~o-˙na      b~adza   ˙g-a
                  inside-ABL outside come-IMP

   (131)     a.   gidzaq         ‘between’
             b.   kampya         ‘to one side’
             c.   pinda          ‘in front of’
             d.   a k˙           ‘on top of, above’ (see the spectogram under §4.3.2)
    The last word, (131d), also occurs in our elicitation lists as the noun for ‘sky.’
Again, we are dealing with a noun that has become grammaticalized as a locational
postposition. Likewise, pinda in (131c) can be used to mean ‘first,’ as in pinda duksi
‘the first/eldest son.’
    We have two lexemes for ‘down, below, or under,’ and another two for ‘up, or
above.’ We have nothing to indicate what the difference might be. The words are:
   (132)     a. aqa              ‘down, below, under’
             b. ama a            ‘down, below, under’
   (133)     a. n~oˆ dze         ‘up, above’
             b. a~ ˆ dze         ‘up, above’
   Another three locational nouns are the following:
   (134)     a. akp˙i            ‘across’
             b. asne             ‘uphill’
             c. paÚtse           ‘downhill’    • Deictic pronouns/locatives. There may be a three-way deictic distinction – prox-
imate, distal, remote – in the Kusunda deictic locatives, but we have been unable to verify
this.
    There are two sets, one for static location and another for “direction to.” The three
forms in each set do not form regular paradigms, the individual members being suppletive.
The forms ape ‘there,’ tape ‘to there,’ and sape ‘to here’ may have formed a paradigm
at one time in the language, but in the modern language the forms are semantically
disparate. The modern paradigms are as follows (it is not known how (135b) and
(135c) differ):
   (135)     STATIC:
             a. t˙isa            ‘here’
             b. ape              ‘there’
             c. nupa             ‘there’
   The locatives in (135) occur with verbs like ‘sit’ or ‘sleep’ in constructions like ‘Sit
here!’ or ‘Sleep there!’
   (136)     DYNAMIC:
             a. tape             ‘to here’
             b. t˙wa             ‘to here’
             c. sape             ‘to there’                                              57

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––             d. isna             ‘to there’
   The locatives in (136) occur with verbs that include motion – like ‘Come here!’ or
‘Go there!’ or even ‘Give it here!’ We have examples of both tape and t˙wa occurring
with the command ‘Come here!’5.4.    Adjectives
    Like Indo-Aryan, but unlike Tibeto-Burman, Kusunda has a distinct “adjective”
class. That is, the property notions of “size,” “shape,” “color,” etc., form an inherent
class of words not derived from other word classes (as with the class of stative verbs in
TB). This does not mean, of course, that the class of adjectives in Kusunda matches the
class of adjectives in any other language. There are several words that occur as adjectives
in English, for example, that occur as verbs in Kusunda. ‘Fat,’ for example, is a verb in
Kusunda, but an adjective in English. (See also §9.1.4 for derived Adjectivals.)
    Adjectives in Kusunda, when occurring in a modifying function, precede the noun
they modify, and in a predicative function they occur with the existential copula tsu (or
kæaÚu, its negative counterpart). Following are examples:
   (137)     MODIFICATION:
             a. huigin ta≥       pokæla-yin
                dirty   water bathe-PROH
                ‘Don’t bathe in dirty water!’
             b. tsi ˙gi tu          ts-~aˆ -dzi
                I    live snake 1-see-PAST
                ‘I saw a live snake.’
             c. h~ukun suta      bæ˙ra-q-ßn
                small thread break-AC-REAL
                ‘The small thread broke.’
   (138)     PREDICATION:
             a. na    amba ola≥ tsu
                this meat tasty is
                ‘This meat is tasty.’
             b. tsi gya ai tsu, gina-ma           limu-tsi-n
                I    strong     am, he-WITH fight-1-REAL
                ‘I am strong, I fought with him.’
             c. nu ta       kam     ˙n wey˙n kæaÚ u
                you this work do good              not
                ‘It’s not good for you to do this work.’
    We spent very little time studying adjectives, and may encounter surprises in a later
study. One thing that did catch our attention was the paucity of basic color terms –
black, white, and red. Even the simplest TB systems have a four-term system – black,
white, red, and green. Still, black, white, and red are the colors predicted by Berlin and
Kay’s (1969) study for a three-term system.
    Yellow and green are also possible in Kusunda, but only as secondary innovations.
Yellow, as in some of the TB languages of the region,2 3 is based on the color of tumeric
powder. The Kusunda word for tumeric is k˙p˙≥, and ‘yellow’ is k˙p˙≥ b˙yo. The

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––word b˙yo is similar to the Nepali bæ˙yo ‘became,’ but we have found it in no other
contexts.
    Our informants, for several weeks, claimed that Kusunda had no word for ‘green.’
Eventually, they produced the word h˙rgun, which appears to be related to Nepali
h˙riyo. The likelihood of this being true is more convincing in the light of a second
word for ‘red’ – kæ˙rgun – based on a Kham corruption of the Nepali word for ‘rust.’
In Kham the word for ‘reddish-brown’ is kæ˙iryaso ‘rust-like.’ The words h˙r-gun and
kæ˙r-gun, then, may mean something like ‘har-like’ (from Nepali ‘green’) and ‘kæ˙r-like’
(from Kham ‘reddish-brown’). The words for ‘black’ and ‘white’ respectively are
soksodi ~ soksog˙r˙m and kasige.
    The Kusunda word for ‘bad’ stands out as unique in the languages of the region.
In both IA and TB, ‘bad’ is commonly expressed only as NEG-good. In Kusunda,
‘bad’ qolom is a separate lexical item from ‘good’ wey˙n.
    Most verbs, too, can be used in a modifying function. For a treatment of these, see
§9.1 on Adnominals and relative clauses.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59]"
