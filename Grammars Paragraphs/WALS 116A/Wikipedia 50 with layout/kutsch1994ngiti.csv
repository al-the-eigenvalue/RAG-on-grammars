Finally, in the process of reduplication, the tonal sandhi processes between
the final tone of the first occurrence of the verb stem L, M, LM, and the tone
on the verb-initial vowel of the second form, L, M, or H, yield the fotlowing
tones on the surface:
              +   Eek
              +M —LM
              + H + LH
The rule LM    + L — LM is applied in the Perfective Present and Past 1 of
verb classes 3 and 4, In the example in v.4, however, an additional and more
general rule is effective because of the initial low component of the tone on
the following syllable: LM -» LH /_ L(M) (see also 4.5).
Examples are given for each of the six relevant verb classes, v.Jab, v.2ab, v.3,
v.4, according to the following sequence of tense/aspect forms: first of all, the
three without segmental marking for tense/aspect PAST3 (generally used as
the citation form), PF.PR, and NAR. The three forms form a tonal minimal
triplet, except in v.4, where there is neutralisation between PAST3 and PF.PR-
Following that, the forms with suffixes are presented:          PASTI,    PAST2,
PAST.CNT, FUT1, and FUT2. The forms with the suffix -na on different
tones form a minimal triplet in cach verb class. The PAST.CNT forms of verbs

The following examples show the use of the regular demonstratives both as
noun modifier and as noun substitute. Since the emphatic morpheme ri has’
its origin in the verb ‘to be’, it cannot cooccur with a form of the verb ‘to be’:
ina sentence. On the other hand, the emphatic form is used when the verb!
‘to be"" is not present in the sentence.                                           2

Even though there are no major dialect differences within the Ngiti-speaking
area, the demonstratives have a number of regional variants. The central
speech variety is the one used for this study; the northern and southern speech
varieties are listed on either side for comparison. The sound shifts attested in’
the sets of demonstratives are the same as noted with other vocabulary
between the three speech varieties (see also Appendix C).

9.5.3 Locative Demonstratives
Ngiti has three sets of three locative demonstratives each. The parameters
regarding relative distance are the same as with the demonstratives mentioned
above; close, intermediate, and far.
       irs                         here
       urs                         there

       (a)ndilé    / (A)ndali      there (farther away)
The   three locative demonstratives azi, dwi,      anda   are considered short or
abbreviated forms of 261, awéld, and andalé. In most environments, they
are interchangeable, though not in all,
The three forms of the first set, ir5, ard, ndors, are exclusively used adverbially. :
The question word ingbors / ingbors ‘where ?’ is related to this set of locative |
demonstratives (sec also 9.6.2).

There is a clear difference in meaning between azi and az616 when followed
by fdza ‘house’, the only noun which also functions as locative modifier (see
9.2.1). In combination with aza / awa / anda (or abbreviated to za / wi / nda),
it always has a locative meaning and functions as an oblique phrase in the ©
sentence. As locative modifier, idza can take a postpositional final High tone
too, in this case: idzi (more precise indication of place, see also 8.3). In
combination with Axil) / Aw6ld / andalé, idza always functions as a nominal ~
phrase.

Two of the five question words function as noun substitutes: adhu ‘what (4
and adhi ‘who ?°. The other three, adha ‘where ?', ife ‘how many ?', ingba
‘which ?’, are used as noun modifier or in an adverbial function in the sentence.
9.6.2.3.1   Noun    Substitute
The two basic question words which function as noun substitutes are adhu/
Adhu ‘what ?' [—human] and 4dhi/adhi ‘who ?"" {+human]. They function in
subject or object position in the sentence, or as modifying noun in an alienable
or inalienable possessive construction. As the only [+ human] question word,
adhi / adhi has a plural counterpart: 4dhima /Adhima ""who.PL ?' (see example
above in 9.6.1).

          word order, There are word-level particles which function with
                                                                             verb phrases
          pronouns and modifiers (9.7.1.1), Other particles function with

9.7.1.2 Phrase-Level      Particles
There are a number of phrase-level particles which function with verb phrases.
They add a semantic aspect of intensity, completeness, precisencss or
suddenness to the verb, Each one of them is intrinsically linked to one verb
only, and cannot be used in other contexts: Within the clause, they immediately
follow an intransitive verb, or they follow the object in a sentence with a
transitive verb. They can also take the initial adjunct position, Several consist
of a CV-syllable only, a structure not allowed in any other word class.
       inga              nti               mbi

 Unlike the previously mentioned clause-level particles, affirmative and
 markers can only take one of two positions in the clause: the. initial adjunct
 position or immediately following the conjugated verb or auxiliary verb. There
 are two affirmative markers      and three negative markers,        used   in mutually

9.7.1.4 One-Word       Utterances
This category consists of words that in themsclyes form a complete utterance,
As such are found exclamations, swear words, a few commands,                and some
others words, as well as the affirmative and negative markers which can
function within the clause as well as independently. The following serve a5
examples:

a coordinative relationship. These could be considered particles functioning
sentence or paragraph level.
With respect to subordination, the following cases can be: distinguished:
1, relative clauses: these have no overt relativiser and precede their nominal
       (in this language     which   is so heavily head-final at phrase-level).   An
head
in-depth study of these is beyond the scope of this work.
2. complement clauses: the noun (i)dhu ‘thing’ functions as complementiser,
                                                                                nal

ndird ‘then, so, however’ (when the sentence does not consist of a polar
question), or ‘or’ (in a sentence containing a polar question).
Ndird can be analysed as consisting of the referential demonstrative ndi
followed by the postposition rd. If this view is indeed correct, ndird should
probably be scen as a short but complete clause in itself. The referential
demonstrative ndi resumes the preceding clause and r3 is the subordinator
marking the sequential chronology (see r3, 9.7.2.2.2 below): ‘when that,’ The
complex construction is now texicalised as coordinating conjunction.

         together with a clause-final postposition.

         The postposition r3 functions both at phrase and at clause level. At phrase          7
         level, r3 functions as a postposition meaning ‘away from’, with a modifier or
         a postpositional phrase (see 8.3). At clause level, rd functions as’a clause-final
         conjunction, signalling a sequential temporal relationship in which the contents
         of the subordinate clause chronologically precede the contents of the main
         clause. It is mostly translated by ‘when’.

There are two sections with paradigms of the Perfective Present. In the first
section, the regular “long” and “short” forms are presented. The second section
gives “long” and “short” forms of the Perfective Present when used as second
verb in serial verb constructions. In the “long” forms of this set, the SC marker
r- is used in all persons, Some of the “short” forms of this set differ tonally
from the “short” forms belonging to the “regular” Perfective Present forms.
The Subjunctive paradigms are introduced by the form itsé. The “long” forms
take the SC marker r-; in the short forms, the subject pronoun is prefixed to
the verb stem. However, there are no short forms for the 38G/PL
non-logophoric and logophoric reference.
The final two sections present a combination of an auxiliary verb followed by
a nominalised yerb stem, NOMI and NOM2, which are tonally contrastive in
several verb classes,
The auxiliary chosen 10 exemplify the NOM1 form is 4 / r¥/ -drd (suppletive
forms of the verb ‘to be’, see 7.6.4.1). When followed by intransitive verbs, a
merger takes place between the last vowel of the auxiliary and the stem-initial
vowel of the nominalised verb. With the transitive verbs, the NOMI      verb form
is separated from the auxiliary by the object.
The auxiliary verb used to exemplify the NOM2 form is arfita ‘to go, SG’, with
its suppletive plural owuta ‘to po, PL’.

In section 1.3, | propose an internal subclassification of LENDU based on a
comparison of 190 lexical items of the six different speech varieties that [ have
been able to record as well as on some phonological and morphological
observations.
Section 1.4 presents some remarks about the historical background of the
LENDU peoples and the surrounding ethnic groups, followed by a clarification
of the names used for the different ethnic groups, subgroups, and speech
varieties,
The remaining sections of this chapter deal with an overview of earlier studics:
done on both Lendu and Ngiti (1.5), and the background and scope of this
study (1.6).
1.1 Classification
Ngiti has thus far mostly been considered as a dialect of Lendu,.a Central-
Sudanic language. No further research has ever been attempted to define its
status within Central Sudanic and in relation 10 Lenda. This section starts with an
overview of the existing internal classifications of Central Sudanic, in particular
the Eastern Central-Sudanic or Moru-Mangbetu languages.
The information on the internul classification of Central Sudanic in this section
is mainly drawn from the following sources: Van Bulck 1948 and 1954, Caprile
1978, Tucker and Bryan 1956, and to a lesser extent from Bokula                          199],

Ngakpa-Najati-Ngalori 1977.

 Tucker (1940:8) mentions that “some have overflowed into the West Nile

 (1972:80) also mentions briefly that there is a small pocket of Lendu speakers
 that spills over the border into Uganda.           Nothing more      particular about the
extent, the number of speakers, or details about the speech               form was known.

on the map, there is in fact a village called Lendu, just across          the border     in

          Pi
          Rrkpa
          Ddra
          Njaw
 It seems that these names indicate neither a purely ethnic identity nor a purely
linguistic identity, but a mixture of both. First of all, they may. be considered
to indicate ethnic groupings. When studying the word lists, though, it becomes
evident that some of their spcech varieties are almost identical (e.g. Dja-dha’
and Ta-dha), whereas others are very distinct (Pi-dha from Dja-dha, and from
Ddra-dha and Njaw-dha), Dja-dha is the speech variety which is used for radio
broadcasts as well as for the written standard of the language. Rrkpa is
considered by the people as a subgroup of Pi, and probably points more to
an ethnic subdivision, since their speech forms are almost identical. [1 must
be said here that those Lendu speakers who have written about their own
language generally cite Bbaledha as having threc (main) dialects: Djadha,
Pidha, and Tadha (Dhejju 1977:2, and Lotsove-Dirive 1981:1). Exception to
this is Ngakpa-Ndjali (1977:5), who cites all six Djadha, Pidha, Tadha,
Rkpadha (cf. my spelling Rrkpadha), Ndjudha (cf. my spelling Njawdha or
Njawlo, see 1,4,2), and Dradha (my spelling Ddradha or Ddralo, sec 1.4.2).
Based on the patterns of relationships between these different speech varicties
which all have @ cognate percentage of 90-100%, a tree could be drawn,
dividing the six into three groups of two nearly identical or closely similar
speech varieties, as follows: Ta-Dja (the southern dialects), Pi-Rrkpa (the
central dialects), and Njaw-Ddra (the northern dialects). Between the three
groups of speech varieties, the southern and the central dialects are more

Njawdha and Ddradha), which is -ra in the Ta speech varicty, corresponds to
Ngiti -ta (and Ngiti northern speech variety -ca), and not to -va. By way of
example, the infinitive form of ‘to see, look at’ (130), is formed as follows:
       Ngiti:                    andi     + in     —    andata
        Ngiti-north:              anja     + ca    —    anjaca

An interesting shift in place of articulation occurs between the alveolar stops,
palatal stops, and palato-alveolar affricates. Both Lendu and Ngiti have a sel
of voiceless, voiced, and prenasalised alveolar stops; Ngiti only has palatal
stops /e/, /#/, /ny/ and Lendu only has palato-alveolar affricates: /t/, /d3/, {nds/.
They correspond to each other in the following way: an alveolar stop in Lendu,
/t/, Jal, or fnd/, corresponds to an alveolar stop in Ngiti, Words with a
palato-alveolar affricate, AY, /d3/, or pd3/, in Lendu have a corresponding
palatal stop in Ngiti when followed by a front vowel, and an alveolar stop
when followed by any other vowel.’ The three sets of examples below represent
the voiceless, voiced, and prenasalised stops respectively.

7 or8 vowels. In addition, some have glides as well. (Sce more detailed remarks
on the vowel systems. of the Lendu speech varieties as presented in 1.3.4.2
below.)
In the area of tone, it must be said that Ngiti is quite different. Although both
the Lendu speech vurieties and Ngiti have a system with three level tones,
Ngiti has considerably more glides on the surface.
Based on both the cognate counts and the phonological comparison between
Ngiti and the other speech varieties, | conclude that Nyiti stands out as
sufficiently different to consider it as.a separate language from Lendu-Bbaledha
within the LENDU subgroup.
1.3.4.2 The Lendu Speech Varieties
When looking at the Lendu speech varieties, several additional remarks can
be made. Firstly, they are all identical with regard to their basic word structure,
which ‘is. CV.
Djadha and Tadha are nearly identical Jexically: A difference between these
two, however, is the infinitive suffix -ra in Tadha, and -Oa in Djadha, as welt
as in Pidha, Njawdha, and Ddradha. (see the examples given above 1.3.4.1).
Tadha, Djadha, and Njawdha have an 8-vowel system which includes a central
vowel which I have represented by a in the wordlists (it corresponds to u in
Pidha and Ddradha, and to the [+ATR] back vowel 0 in Ngiti which is also
somewhat centralised, though not as much as in Tadha, Djadha, and Njawdha).
Pidha and Ddradha have seven vowels. In addition, the three northern speech
varieties. Pidha, Njawdha, and Ddradha present some yowel glides as well:
Njawdha   has two, which | have represented by ery and aw; in Pidha and
Ddradha   four vowel glides are found; ey, ey. aw and aw. The following is a

Nothing significant can be noted for the consonants, except that a velar nasal

velar nasal corresponds to a bilabial nasal in the other speech varieties (see

1.4 Ethnology
The     Lendu   and      Ngiti        people   live surrounded          by    and    imerspersed    with
cattle-raising Hema people. They speak Central-Sudanic languages. The Hema
people living among the northern Lendu have acquired Lendu; those living
around the Ngiti speak KiHema, a Bantu language. Both linguistically and
historically this presents a most interesting situation.
It is difficult to trace the origin of ethnic groups                          through     the centuries.
Unfortunately, the sources are very scanty. In the following section, I present
@ synthesis of three smail articles dealing with the history of the ethnic groups
now living in north-eastern Zaire.
A clarification of the many names used in the literature and by the people
themselves for different ethnic groups, subgroups, and specch varieties is given

 LuNyoro/RuTooro as spoken in Uganda),
 The Northern Hema find their origin in the Lwoo people (Wod'ukumu
 1987:84) who migrated from their original home in the plains of the
 Bahr-cl-Ghazal region in Sudan southward in the direction of the lakes. A
 major group settled at Pubungu in present-day Uganda, in the area of Lake
 Mobutu, which became the centre from which subgroups started migrating and
colonising other ethnic groups. In their next wave of migrations, which started
in the late 16th and early 17th century, they entered the BuNyoro area (Kaputo
1982:56) and must also have adopted LuNyoro as their language. Subsequently,
for lack of space for their cattle, the previous group of immigrants in the
BuNyoro    area now moved     to the west, crossed the Semliki valley and settled
among the Lendu-Bindi people. They are nowadays called the Southern Hema.
The second group of immigrants in the BuNyoro          area migrated by crossing
the lake and settled among the Lendu people. These migrations were finalised
by the middle of the 19th century. This agrees with the information I received
from an old Lendu speaker, who says that the (Northern) Hema people settled
among them about six generations ago.
Those who settled among the Northern Lendu intermarried with them and
adopted Lendu-Bbaledha as their language. They kept their cattle-raising culture
separate from that of the agricultural Lendu but have by now lost most of their
pastoralist culture. The Lendu call them Ji [si]. Those who settled among the
Southern Lendu or Ngiti did not intermarry with them and maintained their own
language, generally referred to as KiHema, a Bantu language, closely related to
LuNyoro/RuTooro (Bantu E 11,12). It seems likely that they are related to the
Hima, a group of pastoralists among the Nyankore (E13). An amount of mixed
culture has emerged in such a way that the Ngiti, who are originally agricultural-
ists, have adopted a certain measure of cattle raising, and vice versa, Southern
Hema do some agriculture in addition to their cattle herding.

        However, because of the supposed common Nilotic origin, the name is
        used in this particular context to indicate those Alur people who have
       lost their language and who now speak Lendu-Djadha.
 Ndruna (sometimes found as Druna or even as Indruna)
       Ndruna (ndrina} is the name of the language of the Indru, as used by
       the speakers themselves. It is an alternative for (Ki)Ngiti and Southern
       Lendu. -na is the 3SG inalienable possessive pronoun, so its literal
       meaning would be something like ‘the people’s’, ‘the inherent possession
       of the people’, ic., their language.
Ngiti (or KiNgiti)
       Ngiti is an alternative name for Southern Lendu or Ndruna, primarily
       in use by the political administration. Its origin is to be found in the
       name of one of the rivers in the area: [anzicé}. Because of this river,
       the administrative centre built near it received this name, However, it
       was misunderstood by the Belgian colonisers and became Gety [geti).
       The name of the language as used in Swahili was based on this, and
       became (Ki)Ngiti,
Njaw, Njawlo and Njawdha
       Njaw (nd3aw) is the name of a Lendu-speaking subgroup located in the
       Watsi Collectivité in the Mahagi Zone.
       Njawlo [ndgawls} is the speech variety of the Njaw. Others call their
       speech form Njawdha [ndzaw6al.
Pi, Pidha, and Pitsi

22 INTRODUCTION
Finally, there are several publications in Lendu, the okdest one being a New
Testament, published by the London Bible Society in 1936. During the past
decade, work on Lendu has been resumed, and has resulted in several literacy
publications, published by the “projet de traduction bbaledha”: two subsequent
alphabet posters (1981 and 1989), a transition primer, 'Akéz# Bbaledha bbld,
in two volumes (1989), a small book of folk tales, Bbatedha ni ngi (1989),
and in the domain           of translation four booklets belonging      to a series ‘New
Readers’ Selections’; Hwé dhi 10-i (1988), a Gospel of Mark (1984), and a
newly translated edition of the New Testament (1988), all published by the
Société Biblique du Zaire. These publications in the language were based on
more thorough linguistic studies, done in particular by two Roman Catholic
fathers (Péres Blanes): José Alcober (1973), who wrote up detailed elements
of the    phonology     and     grammar,   which    would   serve   as language   learning
material for others who planned to learn to speak the language, and Fernand
Mertens (1987), who produced an extensive Lendu-French dictionary.
The publications thus far in Ngiti arc a hyan book, Mungu bha Adyi, from
1980, an alphabet poster, Ndrina t'Andita, 5zita mand, published in 1991,
and three small volumes of a transition primer, K3ze Ndrina mbéyi (1993).
1.6 Methodology       and     Framework
1.6.1 Scope and Overview of this Study
This     thesis on the phonological        and     morphological    structure of Ngiti     is
descriptive in nature. [t attempts to present a picture of the structure of the
language as it is spoken today, showing system and symmetry in the different
domains treated.
Except for just a few small works written by native speakers of Ngiti, no earlier
studies are known about this language, In actual fact, it was not clear how
different Ngiti was from Lend, My earlier involvement in the study of Lendu

stem-initial vowels and/or a different verb class.
Chapter 8 deals with the complex topic of postpositions. A first division is
made      into those postpositions which function with a noun as modifier, and
those which take a non-nominal modifier. The first group is subdivided into
non-derived postpositions and those which are derived from inalienable nouns.
Finally, in chapter 9, the remaining word classes are treated: first of all a
grammatical class of modifiers (9.2), followed by a section On numerals (9.3),
which are a semantic subset of modifiers, Verbal modifiers (9.4) are syntactic
constructions, namely prenominal subject rejative clauses of intransitive verbs,
maybe in the process of being Jexicalised as modifiers having scope over nouns.
The final sections deal with demonstratives (9.5), question words (9.6), and
particles and conjunctions (9.7),
1.6.2 Field Work
Field work on Ngiti was done with the main aim of laying a foundation for a
Bible translation project. Any such project must build on a foundation
consisting of two main parts: a thorough analysis of the language, both
phonologically and prammatically, and an adequate Jiteracy programme, A
complete translation project therefore includes development of an orthography
(the choice of letters for the alphabet as well as the word boundaries), based
on the principle that each distinctive sound receives a scparate representation
in the alphabet. Work on a dictionary (in this case quadrilinguak Ngiti - Swahili
+ French - English) was not only helpful in the process of developing the
orthography, but is also very attractive for the native speakers, since
preservation of their language is very important to many of them. Oral
literature was gathered: proverbs, riddles, folktales, which is an excellent means
for developing u consistent system of word boundaries in the language, Of
course,    they   provide culturally known   reading   material   for early cfforts in
                                                                   INTRODUCTION     25

On a clear day the snowtopped peak Marguerite of the Ruwenzori mountains
can be seen from the village. The seminars were held approximately three
times a year for one to two weeks cach; the first one took place in April 1988.
Both older and younger people participated, with different levels of education.
The direct aim of the group approach was that the native speakers would
contribute as much as possible to the process of developing a written form
for their language. Related to that is the fact that, while working on their
language, they would come to a conscious awareness of how their language
functions in the areas of phonology, tone, and grammar.
The benefit of a mixed group with both older and younger people soon became
clear. The older people generally have a much wider vocabulary and know a
great variety of names of plants, animals, customs ete. Actually, the traditional
numeral system could only be discovered with a few among the older people.
Since no previous work bad been done on the language, the phonological system
was not clear from the outset. Very important in the discovery of the phonology
was native speaker intuition. The first week was. crucial in discovering those
sounds that needed to be represented in the orthography, The interaction and
the mutual benefit of native speaker intuition and an outside linguist is clear when
one realises that the latter has a hard time hearing the exact phonetic difference
between [—ATR]} i and [+ATR] ¢, especially when there are no other vowels in
the word that give a clue to determine the vowel-harmony set. However, native
speakers only wrote the language with five vowels, invariably writing both i and
iasi,and e and ease. Whereas native speakers have no difficulty distinguishing
between i and e, the outside linguist has no difficulty distinguishing between i and
i, nor between e and cr,

2.2 Syllab
The structure of the syllable is described following the three-ticred model as
presented by Clements and Keyser (1983). It consists of the following three
structural tiers to sccount for the syllabic structure:
       syllable tier
       CV-tier!
       segmental tier
This three-tiered model of the syllable aims at providing an adequate
description of both phonological segments and processes which refer to the
syllable and its constituents. As for the vowels, the three-ticred model of the
syllable is relevant for the description of vowel coalescence, where
resyllabification needs to take place (3.5). There are no processes involving
two consonants,
Of the set of core syllables mentioned by Clements and Keyser (1983:28,29),
only the first two, CV and V, are found in Ngiti, This means that the language
is built up of short, open syllables. The syllable type consisting of a V only
occurs in word-initial position. [t always has a simple nucleus, consisting. of
one short vowel. CV-syllables occur both word-initally and word-internally.
Both simple and complex consonants may be found in the onset position.
Internally in compound or derived forms, V may represent a complex nucleus
consisting of a short rising diphthong with (wo different vowel qualities, the
first one of which      is realised as a very short onset to the second one (for
examples see the section on vowel sandhi, cdiphtongisation, 3.5.3).

2.3.2 Evidence         for Consonantal    Contrasts
The examples in this section arc given to show evidence of the contrastiveness of
each of the consonants in the chart above. Compound and derived forms are
avoided; however, verbs are cited with their infinitive suffix -ta. The examples are
given in sets, according to their place of articulation. ‘Three sets are presented for
the consonant contrasts for each place of articulation. The choice of the sets is
made in such a way that the systematic distributional restrictions become evident.
The first set in each section shows the relevant consonants before the vowel a;
the second und third sets before a front and a back vowel respectively, not
differentiated for [ATR]-value, Since vowel height has no bearing on the
consonant, only one set of front and back vowels is used to present the contrasts,
either i or ee, und cither ufo or ofo, Gaps indicate the non-existence of it

2.3.3 Distributional Restrictions
A study of distributional restrictions between consonants and vowels reveals
the following systematic gaps:
1. The affricates pf and by can only be followed by the [+round] vowels u,
@, 0, and » in monomorphemie forms.
                                                      PHONOLOGICAL   STRUCTURE   35
  this cooccurrence restriction is violated. In the process of reduplication
                                                                             (VCV
  + VCY), the stem-fina) vowel of the first element is deleted and the consonant
 is followed by the stem-initial vowel of the second part (see also 3.5.2 and
 9.4.1.2), which may yield a combination of a labial affricate followed by a
 [-round] vowel. The following cases have been found.
          ipfota                              to mould
          ipfo      + ipf)    —> ipfipf        mouldy

          abv       + aby — abvibyai          brooding
 2. The palatal stops ky, gy, and ngy are only found followed by [ — back] yowels
 (i, 4, ¢, &) in monomorphemic       forms.
   ky:    ikyi               cow
          a’ikye             crab
          akye               oil
   gy:    igye               rain
          agyeta             to dominate, oppress
   ngy:   angyi              long ago, previously
          vhingyt            small jar used for milking cows
          ingytyi            bushbuck
          ingyé              bell
However, this cooccurrence restriction may be violated in polymorphemic

 shows. a clear break, indicating voicelessness of the implosive. These two factors
 together do indeed indicate that there is'a clear voiced-voiceless contrast

 utterances with respect to the release of the implosives and the onset of the
 following vowel, there secms to be a difference in the onset of the vowel
 following the two sets of implosives. The case of the voiceless implosives. is
 interesting in that voicing seems to start slightly before the urticulatory release
 of the implosive. This would be evidence for what           I seemed   to perceive
 anditorily, namely that the voiceless implosives contain “an initial voiceless
 clement, followed by some voicing” (Kutsch Lojenga, 1991:82).
 In addition, when looking at the pitch frequency of the examples of voiceless
 implosives, it appears that there is.a sudden increase in frequency just prior
 to its release. Because of the full closure of the glottis for the voiceless
 implosives, there is more transglottal pressure building up than with the voiced
 implosives, and hence the pitch frequency shows momentary increase until the
 pressure is equalised apain. Since the larynx is not quite closed for the voiced
 implosive, just leaving some aperture to create voicing, the transglottal pressure
is much less in the case of voiced implosives, and no sudden increase in pitch
frequency is visible.
In actual fact, this increase in transglottal pressure and hence in pitch frequency
just prior to the release of the voiceless implosives is another argument against
an interpretation as preglottalised voiced cgressive stops (HS suggested: by
Dimmendaal, 1986a). In the enunciation of a voiced cgressive stop, the
transglottal pressure.and hence the pitch frequency is reduced, ie. the effect
of @ (preglottalised) voiced egressive stop on the pitch frequency would be
opposite to what the graph shows for the voiceless implosive.
A final remark should be made about the onset of the voiceless implosives in
particular. It cannot be deduced unambiguously from listening to the recordings

 of articulation. In Ngiti, however, they contrast with  the   palatal  stops, as well
 as with the alveolar stops. Hence, there               really     is   not another
 place-of-articulation column left where they would fit if grouped
                                                                       with the stops.

23.7 Complex and Contour Segments
Many    syllable       onsets   contain    at   first sight   a combination    of consonantal
articulations. The question is how to interpret these. Within the framework of
nonlinear sutosegmental phonology, there is the possibility of representing
multiple articulations within a segment by many-to-one mappings on a single
timing slot, Ngiti has quite a variety of such multiple articulations of consonants,
which are best dealt with as linked to one C-slot, based on simultaneity of
articulation of different articulators (labial-vclar                 stops)   or     homorganic
behaviour (affricates and prenasalised obstrucnts).
Sagey   (1986:56)         distinguishes     between      complex    and    contour    segments,
Complex segments are “multiple simultaneous articulations within the place
node"", whereas she uses the term contour segments for “many-to-one linkings
of sequences of articulations within a single segment”, Ngiti has both complex
segments (labial-velar stops) and contour segments (affricates and prenasalised
Obstruents). In addition, there is a combination of the above, namely the
Prenasalised (sequential) labial-velar (simultancous) stop pingb,
Another way of looking at implosives would be to see if they could be
considered as complex segments with simultaneous articulation of a glottal
closure and a closure in the oral cavity. However, it is hard to judge whether
the two are exactly simultaneous, or sequential after all. Also, within Sagey’s
framework, one would have the laryngeal tier for the glottal constriction and
the supralaryngeal tier for the place node. However, she herself says that
                                                              PHONOLOGICAL         STRUCTURE   47
                                       giti also has a set of voiceless implosives.
 So, strictly speaking, and based on the above arguments,       the implosives do
 not fall in the category of complex segments. In addition, | would not see the
 closed glottis as an extra point of articulation, but rather as a necessary means
 for the initiation of the plottalic-air stream mechanism.
 The following categories of comptex and contour consonants are presented
 below:
 1. Simultaneous articulation: the labial-velar stops kp and gb
 2. Sequential articulation: the affricates: pf, by, ts, dz, and the prenasalised
 stops mb, ad, yd, sy and yg and fricatives my and nz
3. Simultaneous plus sequential articulation: the prenasatised labial-velar stop
pmgb
In the representations and descriptions that account for these complex and
contour consonants, the following feature specifications are needed. The
 place-of-articulation features are {Labial}, (Coronal) and [Dorsal], whereby
 {Coronal} needs to be marked [ +ant} or [ —ant} for the alveolar and retroflex
consonants respectively, and [Dorsal] can be [~back} and [+ back] for the
palatal and velar consonants respectively. The manner features needed are
{+cont) and [~cont) to differentiate between stops and fricatives in particular,
and a privative feature [nasal], which is used to designate the initial element
of the prenasalised obstruents.
Each of the complex and contour consonants presents autosegmental branching
for some feature, be it place of articulation (in the case of labial-velar stops),
or manner of articulation (for the affricates). Prenasalisation can be considered
a case of a [nasal] archisegment N, unspecified for place of articulation,
receiving its specification from the accompanying stop or fricative by spreading
of the place node.
A basic representation is made for each of the different configurations of
complex and contour consonants, whercby features that are the same for the
different articulators are not overtly specified in the representation.

In contrast    to the complex        segments     presented   in | above,     which have an
unordered simultaneous articulation, the contour segments in this section have
an ordered sequential articulation.
As with the simultancously articulated complex segments, the two elements of
the affricates and the prenasalised stops agree for the feature [voice], Unlike
them, however, their points of articulation are the same (the symbols used
may not indicate that completely, but there is a mutual adaptation, pf and br
being cither fully bilabial or fully labio-dental), The manner of articulation
differs in these, since we find a combination of stop-plus-fricative for the
affricates and nasal-plus-oral stop or fricative in the prenasalised obstruents.
In the general representation of the affricates, pf, by, ts, and dz, the voicing
and place of articulation are not overtly mentioned, since they are not
contrastive    between      the two elements.        However,    there      is autosegmental
branching for the manner feature (continuant].

    Prenasalisation     is found    exclusively        with     voiced     obstruents,   so   that    both
    elements of the complex consonant agree for the feature [voice]. This is,
    however, not a universal necessity, but language-specific for Ngiti.
    J. Simultaneous plus sequential articulation
    The only consonant in this category is the prenasalised labial-velar voiced stop,
    consisting of simultancous articulation of two different articulators, as
    presented in 1 above, preceded by a nasal. The underlyingly unspecified nasal
    receives its specification for place of articulation from the Jabial-velar stop,
    and is therefore homorganic to it. The labial-velar stop is a complex segment
    with unordered simultancous articulation for its places of articulation, When
    it is prenasalised, the prerasalisation assumes both articulations.

Two sets of cooccurrence restrictions between consonants and vowels are
described in 2.3.3 above. The generalities can be captured very easily following
the features proposed for the vowel system. The labial affricates pf and by
may only cooccur with [+round] vowels; excluded are [—round] vowels, On
the other hand, the palatal stops ky, gy, and ngy are only found with [—back]
vowels, and never with [+bick}] vowels, Exceptions are found in some
polymorphemic forms, among others created by reduplication.
The [—low] vowels exist in pairs of two, a [—-ATR] and a [+ATR]
counterpart. Unlike Moru-Ma’di languages, which have [a] as counterpart of
a in [+ ATR] context, the vowel a functions in both [-ATR] and [+ ATR]
context in Ngiti. Although inherently [—ATR], it functions as a transparent
vowel in | +ATR] context, neither undergoing nor triggering vowel harmony
changes. (See discussion on lexical yowel harmony, 3.2, and postlexical vowel
harmony in 3,3 below).
Rather than specifying cach vowel for its [ATR] value, the feature [ATR] can
be extracted as a privative feature on the autosegmental level. Certain
morphemes are then marked [ATR]; others are unmarked, and are by default
[-ATR]. The fact that only one value for [ATR] is marked reflects the fact
that the marked value, {+ATR] is indeed the dominant value, and the one
that may trigger vowel harmony changes, Other morphemes receive the
[-ATR] value by default. They have no power to change or trigger harmony
changes, but they can undergo.them in the right context, under the influence
of [ATR}-marked morphemes.
If [ATR]   is considered a separate autosegment, four sets of two vowels are
unspecified. for [ATR] underlyingly. They are represented by capital letters
which stand for phonological archisegments not yet specified for [ATR], Once

The following two remarks need to be made about the realisations of

 All verb stems begin with   a  V-syllab le. There   are   stronger    argumen ts than
 with the nouns to treat this initial vowel   as a prefix,   since  it  has  a semantic
 function in many instances. The initial V-syllable is followed by
                                                                            one or two

V-initial nouns and verbs are subject to certain   restriction s   with   respect   to  the
vowel which may occur in initial position. The   initial vowel     of  such   nouns    may
be a (in the great majority of cases), 1, or O, In addition      ta   these,   verbs may
have an initial U. The vowel E never occurs initially in nouns or
                                                                             verbs.

In one (fairly infrequent) process of nominalisation, verb infinitives function
as nouns (sce 5.11.2.1). These are the only U-initial nouns that exist,

The constraints on VCVCV-verbs affect both vowels and consonants. The
following restrictions apply to the disyllabic root of these verbs* the two vowels
must be identical; the root-medial consonant slot can only be filled by | or r,
whereas oral or nasal sonorants, the retroflex consonants tr, dr, and ndr and
al} palatals are excluded from the C)-position. The two tones of the verb root
in the infinitive must be identical, L-L, M.M, or H.H (see also 4.4.1).

All [—low] vowels within a word must belong to the same harmony set, either
{[+ATR], or [—ATR].
Vowel harmony js determined by the root morpheme; the V- or CV-prefix
harmonises with the vowels of the root for the feature [ATR].

The vowel a is unspecified for            [ATR], ic., when it constitutes the only root
yowel, the prefix vowel must be [—ATR}. However, it does occur as a
transparent vowel in [+ATR] context, where it does not block, undergo, nor
trigger the spread of vowel harmony. This means that a as prefix vowel is
found in words with both [—ATR] and [4+ ATR] roots.

The vowel a may occur in any V-slot in the polysyllabie root, in both |—ATR]
or [+ATR] environment, as long as the vowels cither side of a agree for the
feature [ATR].
The words used to exemplify the behaviour of [ATR] vowel harmony are
nouns (with or without a prefix which harmonises with the vowel(s) of the
root morpheme), or verbs, which always have an initial V- as prefix, which
reccives its [ATR] specification from the root. For ease of recognition, I

 Specification; those without the [ATR] autosegment are by default [—ATR}
 in their output. The [+low]) vowel a does not participate in the harmony
 process, and the [ATR] autosegment cannot be linked to this vowel.
 Compound nouns are excluded since they are considered as two words
 phonologically and therefore may exhibit contrastive values for [ATR] on their

The   first   part   of this section   concerns   the   V.CV   construction,   Le,   a
monosyllabic root, preceded by a V-prefix. Representations are given of words
with different [ATR] specifications and with the transparent yowel a« in
different positions. Cooccurrences and cooccurrence restrictions between prefix
vowels and root vowels are presented in two charts, followed by lists of
examples of cach combination, After thut, longer V-initial nouns are treated
with respect to vowel harmony and the behaviour of the [ATR] autosegment.
The following examples show VCV-nouns or verbs in their underlying form, —
unspecified for [ATR]. All vowels except a are written with upper case letters:

The [ATR] autosegment is then associated to both the root morpheme and |
the prefix vowel. The direction of association is irrelevant.

The two tables above show clearly that E- never occurs in initial position in
VCV words, and that U-initial words are exclusively verbs. There is one more
cooccurrence restriction: the sequence 2-a is not permissible in VCV words,
An explanation is found in the patterns of directional verb derivation (sce
78,2). The yerb-initial yowel of the itive base form is O- (o- or a-). However,
this applics only for roots which contain a [—low] vowel. In roots with the
[ + low] vowel a, the verb-initial vowel marking itive derivation is a. I therefore
assume that, by @ process of assimilation, the original sequence 9-a has become
a-2 in both VCV. nouns and verbs,

                                          of the root vowels      in both [~ATR}
 and [+ATR] roots. The examples below          repre  sent the different cases of
 [-ATR] and [+ATR] words with the vowel
                                                   a in different positions in the
 root morpheme and in the prefix.
 With respect to the occurrence of the vowel  a  in   [+ ATR}-roots, the following
 can be observed. The vowel-a is found in   both    positions, namely as first root
 vowel and as second root vowel in | +ATRJ-en
                                                vironment. In all cases except
 one, the prefix vowel is a. There is only
                                           one example with an      O-prefix, and
 & as second root vowel, Gwiva ‘tree sp,’ There
                                                 are no [+ATR] V-initial nouns
 with a as first root vowel preceded by a [ —low]
                                                   prefix vowel, in which {ATR}
would associate to the two vowels either
                                            side ofa. This could be due to the
fact that the a-prefix js by far the most frequ ent, and that O- does not occur
preceding the [ +Jow] vowel a (as seen in
                                           the table-above, where the sequence’
a-a never occurs in V.CV structures). The data

of a word without [ATR] specification for the

3,2.2 CV-Initial Nouns
This section deals with [ATR] vowel harmony in CV-initial nouns, As in the
previous section, care has been taken to exclude compound nouns, though the
Ngiti and    | may      have failed to identify some       as. compounds.     The     initial
CV-syllable in three-syllable nouns may be considered a prefix when it is one
of the very regularly recurring syllables: ka-, kI-, kE-, ma-, mU-, nya-, pba-,
and rU-, followed by a disyllabic root morpheme. The majority (though not
all) of the disyllabic nouns seems to consist of a root without any such prefix.
This shows that the most frequent and basic structure is that of disyllabie roots,
However, since it is not always possible to define exactly which words do and
which words don't have an initial prefix, the examples in this section are
subdivided according to the number of syliables in the word.
In the following examples, disylabic nouns are presented first, then trisyllabic
founs    (both   with    and    without   prefix),   quadrisyllabic   nouns   (many      are
reduplicated forms), and finally quintusyllabic nouns (only a few examples
exist),
An [ATR] autosegment may belong to the root morpheme, which is then
associated (© both the prefix and the root vowels, except a, which cannot be
associated to the [ATR] autosegment. Examples of representations are given
with the trisyllabic nouns only. The examples in the sections below are grouped
according to the occurrence of the vowel a and its position in the word, The

Quadrisyllabic Nouns
Of the 100 nouns in this category, just over half consist of reduplicated forms
(whose non-reduplicated counterparts do not exist). A number of the other
four-syllable nouns seems to consist of one of the aforementioned prefixes
(only kV- and mV-) attached to a trisyllabic root: In all but two exceptional
cases vowel harmony applies as before.

3.3 Posticxical Vowel Harmony
Ngiti does not have an extensive vowel-harmony system whereby vowels in
roots or affixes which are underlyingly unspecified for [ATR] receive an [ATR]
specification due to spreading of an [ATR] autosegment. However, in rapid
speech, an [ATR] autosegment may spread to the last vowel of the morpheme
or word to its left, thus specifiying it for [ATR], This phenomenon of postlexical
vowel harmony, pot limited in its domain of application, is described and
exemplified in the following two sections by looking at the inalienable
possessive construction, both in its citation form and followed by the 1SG
possessive pronoun du.
In the first section, 3.3.1, we will look at the “citation   forms” of inulicnable
nouns denoting body parts. The examples consist of a [+ATR] inalienable
noun designating a body part, preceded by the noun ale ‘person, somebody’.
       ale + dzo        thigh (lit: somebody's thigh)
       ale + ki         tooth (lit: somebody’s tooth)
In the second section, 3.3.2, we will look at what happens when [—-ATR]
inalienable nouns (here body parts us well as kinship terms and a few others)
are followed by the 1SG possessive pronoun du, which has a [+ATR] vowel.
                                                  PHONOLOGICAL      PROCESSES   77
 When ale, unspecified for [ATR], is juxtaposed to 4 noun specified
                                                                    for [ATR]
 in an inalienable possessive construction, the [ATR] autoseg ment of that noun
 may spread one. syllable to the left thus specifying the precedin
                                                                   g vowel for
 [ATR].
          ale + fi                    —    ‘ale-li     in the mouth
          ale + gyé                   —>   ale-gyé     thigh
          ale + dzo                   —    -ale-dzo    thigh
          ale    +           ta       —    ale-tu      neck, voice
          ale    +           ku       —    ale-ku      tooth
          ale    +           tsu      —    ale-tsu     intestines
          ale    +           dhidhi   —    aledhddhd   heart
          ale    +           hikpé    >    ale-lakpo   kidneys
The rule that accounts for these changes can be represented as follows:
          Vey
            ad
                     +
                         .
                 [ATR]
The rule says that the ATR autosegment Spreads to the left, and associate
                                                                          s
to the vowel to its left. The domain of this rule is any two words which
                                                                         follow
each other in rapid succession within a breath group.
It is not obvious from the construction with ale that the domain  of  spreadin g
is limited to one syllabic, since the ATR aulosegm ent  cannot be linked  to the
[+low] vowel a. Section 3.3.2 contains constructions where
                                                                     the ATR
autosegment has the potential to spread to [—low] vowels further to the left,
but in actual fact doesn't.

{+ATR] nor {+high}, no spreading takes place, and the root is found with
its underlying vowel, as in the following example with na 3PL.LOG:

The vowel I in word-initial position must be deleted in some well-defined

¥i-deletion.
1. Inalienable Nouns in the Citation Form
 Inalienable nouns in their citation form are preceded by the [+ human] noun
‘ale ‘person’, or the [—human] noun idbu ‘thing. The examples here concern
 inali¢nable nouns designating body parts preceded by ale.
Only a, 1, or O may occur initially in nouns, The following are examples of
inalicnable nouns beginning with each of these vowels. The noun stems are
cited here with the tones as pronounced following alc.

 3. Compound Nouns
 Compound nouns are formed by juxtaposition of
                                               two nouns. When the second
 member         of a compound            noun   begins with a vowel, there are thé following
 two possibilities:
 1. Nz begins with I-, in which case rule
                                          1, I-deletion applies,
 2. Nz begins with a vowel other than I-, in
                                             which case rule 3, Diphthongisation
applies (see 3.5.3 below).
The following exemplify the application rule 1:
                                                the initial I- of Nz is deleted.

can only be followed by [+ round] vowels. However, this restriction is violated
when V; is deleted in the process of reduplication of the verb stem in the
following cxamples, In these cases only, there is free variation with
diphthongisation, so that the affricate is again followed by a [+-round) vowel
as onset Of a rising diphthong.

  However, when Nz begins with I, both rule
                                            | and rule 2 could apply. It appears

The following are the possessive prono
                                        uns used in the alienable possessive
construction. There are full forms as
                                      well as abbreviated forms, used in free
variation. The 3SG and 3PL non-logoph
                                          oric pronouns    are not taken into
consideration here, since they form possessive
                                               constructions with bha and 13.

When    the        following noun          begins   with a   vowel,     there   are    the   following
possibilities that arise between               the final vowel of the possessive pronoun
(Vi &, @, §) and the initial vowel of the possessed noun (Vz a, I, O).
          Vi             V2

              4H         I-
              +          O-
Vi-deletion is only applied to the full forms ending in a: pbaka, 1SG and Taka,
IPL.
       pbaka         +        obhi    ->      pbak-dbhi      my knife
       faka          +        dGmvi   —       fak-dmva       our enemies
When the possessed noun has an initial I, there is free variation between
tule 1, I-deletion, and rule 2, V,-deletion, as follows:
       pbaka         +        idza    —       pbaki-dza      ~      pbakidza          my house

3.5.3 Diphthongisation
Diphthongisation applies toll cases of two vowels: meeting uicross. morpheme
or word boundaries in which V; cannot be deleted, and where Vy is any vowel
but I, The following serve as example.

43 Interpretation of Contour Tones
In the previous section, it was shown that the Low-Mid rising tone is clearly
contrastive with all three level tones. In-addition, it was seen that the realisation
of three of the falling tones, HL, ML, and L*, is conditioned by their preceding
and following environment. The rules that predict their realisation are given
above. In this section, some remaining problems of the interpretation of the
rising and falling tones are discussed: first of all the problem of the
interpretation of LH in relation to the LM tone, then those that occur as the
result of the merger of two syllables at morpheme boundaries, MH, HM, and
partly also LM.
4.3.1 LH       versus   LM
There is a surface contrast between LH and LM in non-final CV-syllables
followed by a syllable on Low tone. The following is an exhaustive fist of
LM.L (phonetically            [.<]) on CVCV-nouns; LH.L (phonetically      [/\]) on
CVCY-nouns          is'a much more frequent pattern, and only a few examples are
Biven,
                                                                            TONE    97
is very small. There may be three examples of alienable nouns: kpétdya
‘carefulness’, musi ‘sweet banana sp.’, fim’ ‘purpose’, as well as a few
inalienable nouns -dhédha ‘heart’, -rr3 ‘a little bit of liquid’, -vivi Sting (of
insect)’,
The (wo patterns H.L and LH.L seem contrastive synchronically, though the
evidence is not very convincing, especially since there also seems to be some
fluctuation between a LH and H tone followed by L and preceded by pause.
One interpretation therefore is that the LH.L pattern could have developed
from an underlying H.L pattern, with an optional realisation rule that H —- LH
when preceded by pause and followed by L.
Similarly, there are many three-syllable words, both    V-initial and CV-initial,
which have a L.LH.L tone pattern on the surface      {_ J]. Contrastive LLL
or L.LM.L patterns are absent on monomorphemic nouns (though they are
found on compound notins).
        Agiiyi      famine            kapild =— hat
        akura       raven             makire    news, messape
        Amveva      chimpanzec        mbilika    basket
Consequently, it would be possible to interpret the LH rising tone in this
context also as an underlying H tone.
However, there are some arguments against this interpretation, too, Firstly,
an initial level H tone on a CY-syllable does occur in words with more than
two syllables, even when followed by L:
        kAtdyek?    H.LL     Ir.)       sorghum sp.
        kitstingd   FLLLM    [-\J]      small purse
        kolégbe     H.LLM    [- J]      cricket sp,
The initial tone in these words is definitely a level H tone, and there is no
trace of a LH realisation, which might be expected in word-initial position and
followed by L.

44 Distribution of Tones and Tone Patterns
There are a number of restrictions on the tones that may occur in different
positions in the word. Similarly, there are also restrictions on the tonal patterns
on words of different word classes and different syllable structures,
                                                                                  of
In this section, the distribution of tones and tone patterns is presented first

all on verbs (two structures: VCV-stems, and YCVCV-stems), then on
(V-initial and CV-initial separately, and subdivided according to word length).
Words of other classes are mentioned whenever they form exceptions.
Otherwise it can be assumed that they follow the tone patterns found on nouns
of comparable structure.
44.1 Tone on the Verb Stem

The M.L tone pattern on verbs varies freely with LL The choice to write
M.L is an arbitrary onc.
The underlying tone of the infinitive suffix -ta ts Mid. 11 becomes       High by a
process of spreading from a High-tone root.

on the initial V-syllable. The root syllable
                                                 carries any one of the four
contrastive tones; Low, Mid, High,    or Low-M id,   Howev er, only five of’ the

Nouns can be divided into two sub-classes, alienablé and inalienable nouns.
This division is based on the way in which they behave in possessive
constructions, Certain nouns can be classified us inherently inalienable, others
as inherently alienable, but there is some overlap in that there are nouns which
may occur in both alienable and inalienable possessive constructions, with or
without semantic distinctions. This may indicate that it is not the noun as such,
but rather the relationship between the noun and its possessor which should
be classified as ulienable or inalienable. T have, however, for practical reasons!

                                           The result js. a VCV-noun, sometime
  followed by a morpheme                                                              s
                             ong   (5.11 .1.2/3). These nouns derived from verbs
  mostly have the same segmentals as
                                        the verb Stem, but often  exhib it a diffe
  tone pattern, In some rare cases, howev                                          rent
                                           er, the initia) vowel of the noun differ
  from the initial vowel of the verb stem:                                            s
        ozé-ta        to love
        azé          love
         ubhi-ta     to walk, travel (inherently plural)
        abhi         walk, travel
        uyi-ti       to place protective fetishes in the field
                                                               s
        ayi-ngi      —_fetishes: placed in the fields as protection
2. optional presence Of the prefix
 In a number of nouns with at least a disyll
                                             abic stem, the
                                                        presence of the prefix
syllable, V- or CV- is optional, which
                                       would indicate that this syllabic is not
an inherent part of the root. The follo
                                        wing forms occur in free variation:
       Agiri         ~ piri          cold
       agirukye      ~ girikye       big lizard
       agbényd      ~ gbénya         bird sp.
       akali        — kali          firewood (possibly a compound noun)
       akatsu       — katsu         reed sp. (possibly a compound noun)
       akuku        — kuku          weevil

       mixizana / -dzana        help (AL/INAL)
       miléma = / -lema         victory (AL/INAL)
in several other instances, the root exists with and without the prefix, one
being a regular noun, the other one a proper name. The examples make it
dear that this is not a regular and productive system, but concerns some
isolated pairs only. However, it is an additional argument in favour of the
interpretation of mi’- and ki- as prefixes.

The optional presence or absence of the initial prefix vowel is not only found
with nouns; it also takes place with several polysyllabic modifiers, see 9,2.1.3.1.
3. singutar-plural formation by means of prefixes
The singular-plural forms of some nouns make use of Bantu-like prefixes,
which give an indication that these and other CV-forms can be considered
prefixes, albeit a case of borrowed morphology. For an exhaustive list, see

The frequent recurrence of certain specific CV-syllables in the majority of
three-syllable nouns may indicate that they are not part of the root, but

Even though there are no original noun stems with an U-prefix, there are just
a few examples of nouns derived from U-initial verbs, The U-prefix only
remains if the complete infinitive form (VCV-ta) is nominalised. There are
no VCV-nouns derived from verbs which haye an initial U-prefix.

§,2.4 Reduplication
Reduplication is not a productive feature found with Ngiti nouns, though quite
a few nouns have reduplicated stems. Their origin can only sometimes be
retraced 10 a non-reduplicated form (CV or CVCY verb root) which has a
“pasic” meaning from which the reduplicated nouns have been derived.
Five surface patterns of reduplication are found, They are treated in turn; 3
reduplicated C¥-syllable without prefix and with prefix; a reduplicated
CVCV-structure without prefix and with prefix, and finally a VCVCY-structure,
which   can    be considered   a reduplication   of a VCV-form,     analogous to a
productive system in the formation of verbal modificrs. No special regularities
can be observed in the tone.
1. réduplicated monosyllables without prefix
Quite n few nouns have the structure C;ViCyV;, which could be considered a
reduplication of a CV-syllable. Their non-reduplicated counterpart does: not
exist except in the following cases. The alienable noun dhédhe ‘jey’ has an
inalienable counterpart, -(i)dhé; both can be related to the verb idheta ‘to
jump or run for joy’. The noun riri ‘grass. sp.’, is probably derived from the
verb irita ‘to not grow well’, The inalienable noun -rdrd ‘little bit of liquid’ is
possibly related to the verb arsta ‘to strain, filter, milk the last little bit’. The
verb izeta ‘to joke” has resulted in the reduplicated noun zéze ‘joke’.

 5.3.2. Prefixation
 A number of nouns have an initial prefix mU- (mu-
                                                   or mw-). Since the     Ngiti
 Speakers are familiar with Swahili and other Bantu langua ges spoken in their
 area, this prefix probably reminds them of the Bantu

                                                     There is, however,      a lot of
 variation in the use of these prefixe s betwee n individ ual speakers. In addition,

      -tsuki    < tsb + ka       mouth + hair         beard, moustache
The inalienable possessive pronouns do not follow the first part of the
compound, but the second part, as is exemplified with du 1SG,POS., thereby
showing     that the original (and still transparent)       compound     js treated as a
monomorphemic noun.

 5.4.2 Kinship Terms
 Kinship terms, being { + human] nouns,    have separate singular and plural forms.
 In the singular, they can be  cited in  isolat ion; in the plural (marked by tone,
 sce 5.3.3), they must be cited in their
                                           Possessed form.
 The kinship terms take 4 slightly different
                                                 set of pronominal Posses  sives from
 the body parts. The differences lie in the additi
                                                       on of a suffix -ni or -na in
 certain forms, including the citation form, and in
                                                     the tone of certain Possessives.
 In fact, the tones of the possessive pronouns differ
                                                         between singular and plural
forms in 38G.LOG, 3PL.LOG, and IPLEXCL, as
                                                          described in detail in 6.3.1.
In the following list, all inalienable kinship terms.
                                                        are listed. The first column
gives the non-possessed singular citation forms;
                                                       the second column presents
the plural possessed citati  on forms.  Vowel  sandh i   proce sses take place at the
boundary: between ale ‘person’ and the first vowel
                                                            of the kinshi

presented in 3.5.1. The word al-ava-na ‘langu
                                             age, culture, custom’ is inflected
in the-same way as the plural kinship terms.

‘brother-in-law’ and ‘son-in-law’ by its use of the two different possessive
constructions, When used in an inalienable possessive construction, it carries
the meaning ‘brother-in-law’, but when used in an ualiennable possessive
construction it refers to ‘son-in-law’.
       nz                 brother-in-law; son-in-law
       azi-du             my brother-in-law
       pbaka azi          my son-in-law
The term zadh@ is a synonym of az in its reference to ‘brother-in-law’. It is
found with both alienable and inalienable possessive marking:
       pbaka zadhob       =~   zadhi-du    — my brother-in-law
A   few other kinship    terms can be used as alienable or inalicnable nouns,
without any semantic difference;
       dada             elder sister
       dada-du          my élder sister
       pbaka dada     = my eer sister
       kadza              cousin
       kiidza-du          my cousin
       pbaka kidza      = my cousin
The word adhi ‘friend, offspring, delivery’, derived from the verb odhbita ‘to
give birth’, is found in both alicnable and inalienable possessive constructions.
On two different tonal patterns in the inalienable possessive construction, it
shows slight semantic differences: ‘friend’ and ‘offspring’. The same noun in
an ali¢nable possessive construction refers to ‘delivery’:
       adhi              birth, offspring, friend
       adhi-du           my friend
       ddhi-du           my offspring
       pbaka odhi        my delivery

                                          which are exclusively used in fixed
expressions with the verb anzita ‘to do’,

All of these have a final High or rising tone (theuzh not-all inalienable nouns
with final High or rising tones belong to this category). The locative
postposition, a floating High tone (sec also 8,3), has attached itself to the final
Low or Mid tone of the original noun, thereby producing some tonal sandhi
processes, with the hypothetical underlying non-locative form as basis:

Tonal alternations are attested in the relatively few cases where the inalienable
noun can also be cited in isolation (see the lists in 5.4 above), In all cases this
concerns inalienable nouns which have a M.M tone pattern in their isolation
form and a M.L pattern in their possessed form. The tonal modification is
therefore marked only on the last syllable of the head noun,

5.5.2 Alienable Nominal           Possessive
The alicnable nominal possessive construction is marked by an explicit
possessive marker (POS) between the modifying noun (N;) and the head noun
(Nz):
                  N; - POS       - Nz
In actual     fact, this possessive         marker   is a postposition, often with a tonal
modification when it functions in the possessive construction. This means that
the alienable nominal possessive construction consists in fact of a postpositional
phrase as modifier of the heact noun, A number of different postpositions can
                                                                                NOUNS   153

5.6.3 Three-Noun Compounds
Only   few compound      nouns consist of elements other than                two   nouns. The
most interesting, however, is a   list of compoun d  nouns consisti ng of a
Succession of three nouns. The following serve as example. Note
                                                                  that in all
cases the final element js an inalienable noun; in most cases the
                                                                  second noun
is also an inalienable noun.
The internal structure of these three-noun compounds                   musi be scen as two
subsequent    compounding           processes,    first N;    +   Nz   The   resulting   N;+2

  5.7 Diminutives and Augmentatives
 Ngiti has a system of diminutive (DIM) and augme
                                                   ntative (AUG) formation
 by using certain alienable and inalienable [+hum
                                                    an] nouns as head of
 compound-like constructions. Since all [+human]} nouns
                                                         can be pluralised, all
 diminutive and augmentative compounds also
                                            have separate forms   for Singular
 and plural. Thus, there are no Separate singular and
                                                      plural forms for words
 like house, snake,    trec, mountain,   but diminutives   and augmentatives   formed
 from any of these nouns do have separa       te   singul ar and plural forms; small
 house and small houses, tall tree and tall trees,
                                                    big mountain and big mountains,
 5.7.1   Diminutives
In order to form a diminutive, the word ingba ‘child’ is
                                                         postposed to any noun.
The strategy used is the same as compound format
                                                 ion, whereby the two nouns
are juxtaposed. Since ingba has a Suppletive plural
                                                      form, inzo ‘children’, the
addition of this form creates a plural diminutive of
                                                     any |-+human] as well as
{—human] noun. The initial F is deleted (see 3.5.1).
                                                       As for tonal behaviour,
in the case of ingba and inzo, a floating High tone
                                                     must be posited between
the two elements, which is grounded on the
                                           first noun, and causes some   tonal
modifications; . + H -» LM,M       +  H—+H     (H  +   H = H;LM +H =
LM). It is this extra floating High tone which disting
                                                       uishes the diminutives
from regular compounds with the nouns ingba and
                                                inzo (sce also 5.6.2 above).

§.9 Proper Names
My corpus     contains      nearly 200 proper names      of people: Rarely does Ngiti
have proper names that are used for both men and women. Only two examples
have been     found. The majority of the others is masculine, about a third is
feminine.
§.9.1 Proper Names derived from Nouns
A very common and the most regular way of forming proper names for people
is by the addition of the morpheme -si to a noun for feminine proper names
(n.pr.f}, and -zo for masculine proper names (n.pr.m).

5.11 Nominalisation and Nominal Construction
This section on nominalisation is divided into three major parts. First of all,
there are different processes by which nouns are derived from verbs (5.11.1).
Four morphological strategies are described, three of which are action-related.
The fourth strategy, tonally constrastive with one of the three action-related
strategies, marks the result of the action or an object related to the action,
Secondly, there is participant-noun formation (5.11.2). A distinction is made
between participant nouns on the one hand, and agent nouns with expressed
abject. Two strategies of the former are described, and one of the latter,
Finally, nominalisation processes take place in order to make the members of
a particular class of words take a nominal function in the sentence, In. this
way, modifiers, verbal modifiers, numerals, and postpositional phrases can be
nominalised. When nominalised, they may function in possessive constructions,
postpositional phrases, or as head of a subject or object noun phrase. All these
constituents undergo one and the same process of nominalisation, which is
described in’ 5.11.3.
§.11.1 Verbal   Nouns
There are four strategies to derive non-participant nouns from verbs:
    1. verb stems + -ta
    2, verb stems on a M.H tone pattern
    3. verb stems on a M.H tone pattern + -nga
   4, verb stems on other tone patterns
                                                                          marks
The first three strategies listed are action-related; the fourth category
the result of the action or an object related to the action of the verb.
All four strategies are considered nominalisations by means of morphological
                                                                         tone.

 Verb infinitives are formed by adding the suffix -ta to the

 have an infinitive form with -ta, except certain auxiliary verbs.
 Semantically, they are action-related.  They   can be glossed  by an infinitive: ‘to

  The latter is shown by the prefix m- preceding the verb

Nominalisation of these constituents takes place by way of a syntactic
construction, namely the formation of an inalienable possessive construction
with the noun inga as empty head, preceded by the modifier, verbal modifier,
numeral, or postpositional phrase. [n this way, it has formally become a noun
phrase, which can function in any nominal slot. In fact, inga is the most general
{[—human] noun that exists in Ngiti. [ts meaning is ‘place, fields, time,
atmosphere, abstract thing’. In this context, inga is subject to I-deletion (see
3.5.1) and surfaces therefore as -nga.
The. following sections treat nominalisation of modifiers, verbal modifiers,
numerals, and postpositional phrases and present examples of these
nominalised constituents in different syntactic environments: as modifying noun
within @ postpositional phrase, or in a possessive construction; in subject or
object slot within the sentence, It is gencrally very difficult to determine the
meaning of any of these nominalised constituents in isolation since their
interpretation depends so much on the context. An attempt is made, however,
to give an approximate meaning for most of the nominalised forms.
5.11.3.1 Modifiers
All modifiers can be nominalised by the nominaliser (NOM) -nga. The
following are some examples of modifiers with their nominalised forms: Their
meanings are expressed by abstract nouns,

sfot.

       but    = REP:PL work in good-NOM be NEG                    be
       but in these works, goodness (benefit) is not
Locative and temporal modifiers are also nominalised when they function in
4 nominal slot. Their meaning, though hard to express outside the construction
in which they function, is rendered here by the general word ‘place’ for the
locative modifiers, or ‘time’ for the temporal modifiers.

5.11.3.2 Verbal Modifiers
If their function in a phrase or clause requires it, verbal modifiers (see 9.4)
are also nominalised by addition of the nominaliser -nga.
In the examples below, the verb is cited first, then the verbal modifiers with
the tones of their citation forms, followed by their nominalised forms, abstract
nouns. In some rare instances, other inflected forms of verbal modifiers have
been found nominalised.

      Noun            ®pupi-ngn      — fatness
Like the nominalised modifiers mentioned above, the nominalised             verbal
modifiers are particularly used in inalienable possessive constructions.

       ddre               ten          idre-nga
These forms.are used when they need to function as a nominal in the phrase
or clause. In the following sentence, the nominalised form atdinga functions
as the head of the possessive construction ka t5 atdinga ‘one of them’.
       idyi               ki      5   atdi-nga

5.11.3.4 Postpositional Phrases
Whenever      a postpositional phrase has to function in a subject or an object
slot in the sentence, it must be overtly nominalised. The postpositional phrase
as a whole takes the nominaliser -nga. This results in a sequence
noun-postposition-noun, which js identical in structure to the alienable
possessive construction, whose possessive marker is in fact a postposition (see

In the following example, the postpositional phrase otu *S ‘on the road"" is
nominalised and functions as modifier within another postpositional phrase.

the ulienable possessive pronouns precede the noun, whereas the inalienable
possessive pronouns follow the noun, In addition, there is a set of indirect
object pronouns (6.4). The logophoric function deserves special mention, since
it is found with all the categories of pronouns: subject/object, possessive and
indirect object (6.5),
6,2 Subject and Object Pronouns and Clitics
Ngiti has one set of pronouns functioning both in subject and object position,
In addition to free-standing subject pronouns, each verb curries an agreement
marker, These subject concord markers prefixed to the verb stem are an
obligatory element in conjunction with the free-standing subject pronoun. The
existence of both subject pronouns and agreement markers’on the verb in
Ngiti - its closest neighbour Lendu only has subject pronouns - may be due
to a diachronic development, possibly influenced by the structure of
neighbouring Bantu languages, by which the original free-standing pronoun
became   an   obligatory   part   of the   verbal   word,   after   which   it served   as
agreement marker in conjunction with a free-standing pronoun (the “long
form”). If another constituent occupies, the initial adjunct position, the
free-standing pronoun is no longer an obligatory element (the “short form”).
Subject and object pronouns may be immediately attached to the verb stem.
In that case, they are considered clitics, since they are syntactically independent
morphemes, phonologically bound to the verb stem. Subject clitics are
particularly used with second and subsequent verbs in serial verb constructions.
Object pronouns may be cliticised to the verb stem when they follow an
auxiliary verb and precede the main verb (in SAuxOV constructions}. The
pronoun loses its vowel and the consonant is allached to the initial vowel of
the verb stem. This does not apply to the longer pronouns which have come
into the system through a process of grammaticalisation: Abadhi 3$G.masc,
iyadhiya 3SG.fem, alé 1PL.INCL, and abédhi 3PL, although a shortened form
of the IPL.INCL pronoun alé may be found as clitic; (a)l~~ The case of 3SG
k’- is particular in that it is considered a clitic, though in subject function if
is used frequently ina “short form” in all tense/aspect forms (see also 7.2.4).

6.2.5 Grammaticalisation
Several of the pronouns in the table above are most likely the result of a
process of grammaticalisation: 3SG abadhi, iyadhiya and 3PL abadhi,
IPLINCL alé, and 3SG.LOG ndi. The following remarks about their nominal
origin can be made.
The third person pronouns Abadhi and abadhi consist of the stem for ‘father’,
aba (SG) and -aba- (PL, but which never occurs in isolation, see al-aba-na,
5.4.2) followed by a morpheme -dhi in the singular and -dhi in the plural. This
morpheme originally indicated possession, and the terms abadhi and abadhi
could be translated ‘owner(s)'.
The form fyidhiya, ‘owner, fem.’, is the feminine counterpart of abadhi. Its
origin is found     in the inalienable kinship       term    iya- ‘mother’.   It is used
infrequently,
The IPLLINCL pronoun alé most likely originates from the noun ale ‘person,
people’, and has been incorporated into the pronoun system through a process
of grammaticalisation in which it has acquired the same tonal pattern as the
other   first and   second-person   plural     pronouns,    In fast speech    alé can   be
shortened to become Jé, and in cliticised form to l--.
The 38G.LOG pronoun ndi is identical to the inalienable noun -ndi ‘skin’. It
looks plausible that this word hus been incorporated into the pronominal

verb, In the former case, the vowel of the pronoun is deleted before the initia}
vowel of the verb, and the pronoun ka is reduced to k*- cliticised to the verb
stem. When it is followed by the auxiliary element ri (a suppletive form of
the verb ‘to be’, marking present continuous action), the 38G pronoun carries
a Low tone, ka.

The 3SG pronoun abadhi js often used in free variation with ka. Its meaning
is more restricted, though: ka may be used for any third-person referent,
abadhi is used exclusively for [+ human] masculine referents. It has a feminine
counterpart, iyadhiya, used infrequently.
Even though the 3SG pronoun abadhi is well-known and immediately
understood, it is not used ‘as commonly as its plural counterpart abadhi, which
is the only possibility to express 3PL both for masculine and. feminine,
In object position, « separation needs to be made between humans, animals,
and things. The following system seems to emerge, whereby abadhi and
iyadhiya are used for singular human objects, and abédhi for plural objects
referring to humans and animals. The pronoun ka loses its reference to
number, since it is used-not only for all singular objects (human, animals, and

pronouns, These are presented in separate sections below (6.2.9 and 6.5.1).
6.2.7 The Indefinite Pronaun
The 38G pronoun ka also functions as indefinite pronoun (INDEF), ‘one,
they’, In Ngiti, however, the indefinite is close to the first person             plural
inclusive, both in form and meaning, for the following reasons.
   lL. Its-concord marker prefixed to the verb is the same as the one used
      with the IPL.INCL pronoun al€, namely k-, whereas the concord marker
      agrecing with the 38G pronoun ka is §-.

63.1   Inalienable Possessive   Pronouns
The following table shows the possessive pronouns used to mark inalienable
possession. The basic set is used following the noun and contains six pronouns
for    the   person/number       categories   ISG/PL.EXCL,       2SG/PL,    and
4SG.LOG/PL.LOG. For the other categories, 3SG/PL non-logophoric, and
IPL.INCL the regular personal pronouns are used preceding     the noun, without
an intervening possessive marker.
In the chart below, the set used for body parts and other inalienable nouns
which can be possessed by a [++ human] possessor is considered the basic set,
Inalienable nouns which can only be possessed by a [— human] possessor may
only take the 3SG possessive pronouns, They are dealt with below.
The kinship terms, which exhibit singular-plural distinctions, must be treated
Separately. The possessive      pronouns used with the plural kinship terms are
the same as the ones used for body parts and other inalienable nouns, but
those with the singular kinship terms exhibit some tonal differences. In
addition, in those cases where the kinship term takes a personul pronoun
which precedes the noun, an additional suffix -ma or -na is present.
In the chart below, the following categories are distinguished: body parts
(including all other nouns except, that can be possessed by a [+human] or a
{—human] possessor, except kinship terms), kinship terms singular, and kinship
terms plural. The personal pronouns functioning as possessives in 3SG, 3PL,
and IPL.INCL are included in the chart. Hyphens indicate morpheme
boundaries, and the position in relation to the noun which they modily.

64 Indirect Object Pronouns
Ngiti has a separate set of indirect object pronouns, They function as oblique
phrases in the sentence, in the same way as posipositional phrases do. This
is evident in the forms for 3SG/PL non-logophoric reference and 1PL.INCL,
which consist of the regular personal pronouns followed by the postpesition
t3 (or y3 in its weakened form). Specific forms of the indirect object pronouns
exist   for   1SG/PL.EXCL,           2SG/PL,     and     3SG.LOG/PL.LOG.   The   full   set,
including some free variant forms, is displayed in the table below.

Logophorit pronouns in the narrower sense of the word are used in a number
of African languages in indirect speech, marking coreference with the subject
of the matrix clause containing a yerb of “speaking”. Ngiti uses logophoric
pronouns in a broader sense: they are not limited to reported specch, but may
be found in other contexts also, referring to a nominal or pronominal subject
introduced in a main clause. The main clause introducing the third-person
referent may precede or follow the subordinate clause containing a logophoric
pronoun.   Ngiti being a head-final           language,   the subordinate clause often
precedes   the   main   clause,    and   so    the   logophoric    pronoun       precedes    its
antecedent, In a chain of main clauses, the introduction of the third-person
referent precedes the use of logophoric pronouns,
There is a closé semanti¢ link between reflexive and logophoric pronouns, and
in many languages reflexive pronouns are used with a logophoric function as
well. This is indeed the case in Ngiti, where the subject/object pronouns ndi
(SG) and ‘i (PL) can be called both reflexive and logophoric. A reflexive
pronoun is an object pronoun coreferent with the subject of the sentence and
as such it is in fact identical to a logophoric pronoun.
The   following sections exemplify        the function of the           logophoric    pronouns.
Subscript letters i and j are used to Indicate coreference or non-coreference.
6.5.1 Logophoric Subject and Object Pronouns
The 3SG/PL. subject/object pronouns, clitics and concord                    markers    marking
coreference and non-coreference are the following:

    7.2 The Structure of Verb Forms
    Ngiti verb forms have the following structure:
           C-     V-CV(CV)-CV

           vert   Verb Root
           vVsx   Verb Suffix
    7.2.1 The Verb Stem
    The verb stem consists of an obligatory stem-initial vowel (SIV) as stem prefix
    and a verb root (VRT).
    The verb root is monosyllabic: a CV-syllable, or disyllabic: CVCV. The
    disyllabic structure is subject to the following restrictions: both vowels are
    identical, the root-medial consonant can only be | or r, certain consonants are
    excluded from the C;-position, and the two syllables have identical tones in
    the Infinitive, and only an additional L.LM tone pattern in certain conjugated
    forms (which becomes L.LH before a L-tone suffix). For more details and

The subject pronouns are cliticised to the verb stem in the Perfective Present,
when it occurs as second or subsequent verb in a serial verb construction, The
difference between a Subject Concord marker (SC) and a subject clitic (SCL)
lies predominantly in the tones: the former are inherently toncless and
therefore do not alter the tone on the stem-initial vowel; the latter have their
inherent tone and cause changes to the tone of the stem-initial vowel,
Tonal neutralisation occurs between the 1PL and 2PL subject clitics and the
1PL and 2PL forms with a SC marker not preceded by a free-standing subject
pronoun (the “short” forms, sce 7.2.4}, in which the LM tone of the pronouns
is realised on the initial vowel of the verb form.
Object     pronouns   may    be followed by the resumptive       marker   or may be
cliticised immedintely to the verb stem whenever they precede the main verb
in   its   nominalised      form      (NOM1   and   NOM2    in   a   SAuxOV(NOM)
configuration). In the same way as with the subject clitics, the object clitics
cause changes to the tone of the stem-initial yowel.
The verb forms which can be preceded by a subject or object clitic are the
Perfective Present, which has a Low tone on the stem-initial vowel, and the
two nominalised forms of the verb (NOMI             and NOM2), which both have a
Low tone on the stem-initial vowel also.

7.2.3 Suffixes to the Verb Stem
Not all tense forms have a suffix. Some are exclusively marked by tone on
the stem-initial yowel (identical in all verb classes) in conjunction with tone
on the root (different according to the verb class).
Several tense paradigms, however, have a suffix following the verb stem. The
suffix -na is the most frequent. It occurs with different tones, marking the
different tense forms together with the tones on the stem-initial vowel and
the verb root. The suffix tone remains constant across the various verb classes
within any one tense.
The following examples represent all tense forms which are formed with a
suffix -na on Low, Mid, or High tone.

7.24 Types of Verb Forms
Three types of verb forms need to be
                                     distinguished in order to account for
the different tonal configurations.

construction. The surface tonal realisations resulting from the
subject clitics with the Low tone of the stem-initial vowel are described in
7.2.2.3 above.
The difference between the first two types lies in the presence or absence of
a free-standing subject pronoun, ‘Type 1, a verb form consisting of SC marker
 + Verb Stem preceded by a free-standing pronoun, represents the “long”
form. Type 2 comprises those forms, also consisting of a SC marker followed
by the Verb Stem, which are preceded by some other clement than a subject
pronoun in the initial adjunct position: a negative or affirmation marker, or a
clause modifier. These are the “short” forms.
Subject concord markers are toneless, so, in principle, the verb forms of types
1-and 2 should be identical. They are, in fact, identical in the singular forms.

230 VERBS AND VERBAL MORPHOLOGY
The three tone patterns on the Infinitives do not, by themselves, show the
basic division into tonal classes. In fact, a second criterion is needed in order
to divide the verbs into four major classes according to their tonal behaviour,
since the M.M.M verbs constitute a neutralisation of two major classes. The
tones on the Imperative are used in conjunction with those of the Infinitive
to determine the four main classes of verbs (as is shown in 7.4 below).
Imperatives
The Imperative singular consists of the VCV or VCVCV verb stem only, with
a High tone on the verb-initial vowel. In the Imperative plural, the verb stem
is preceded by the toneless subject concord markers k- for 1PL.INCL and ny-
for 2PL; the verb-initial vowel has a Low tonc.
There is a three-way tonal distinction on the verb root: L, M, and LM (on
disyllabic roots realised as LLL, M.M, and L.LM), Singular, 1PL and 2PL forms
ate presented together. In the first three examples, the tone on the verb root
is the same in singular and plural. In the last example, the verb-root tones
are different between singular and plural. For further detail, see 7.6.2.1.

Reflexive verbs aré a subcategory of transitive verbs. They must take an object
in the form of the reflexive pronoun ndi (SG) or 4 (PL). Transitive verbs may
be used reflexively, but there is also a category of reflexive verbs that is Strictly
reflexive in that they cannot take a nominal object. Reflexivity is a formal
Property of these verbs which is rarely transparent in the meaning.
This gives rise to the following categorisation of the verbs into two major
classes; intransitive and transitive, whereby the transitive verbs are subdivided
into reflexive and transitive.

_ vowel. The intransitive, basic form, may have any vowel stem-initially. If it has
  an I-, the basic verb and its transitive derivation may be entirely homophonous,

7.4.2.1    Main     classes
A first division into four main classes is made on the basis of tone in the
Infinitive    and     Imperative.   Since   only   three   tonal   configurations   are   the
maximum differentiation found across the verb classes in the Infinitives or any
conjugated verb forms, neither Infinitive nor Imperative forms alone will
account for the division into four main classes. This means that in certain
cases, two verb forms are needed to recognise the basic verb classes. The two
verb forms that most casily show the four main verb classes based on tone
are either Infinitive and Imperative singular, or Imperative singular and
Imperative plural. In this section, both are exemplified. Because verbs are
normally cited in their Infinitive form, any later reference to the determination
of verb classes will make use of the Infinitive, with the Imperative singular, if
needed.
Verb class 1 can be determined on the basis of Infinitives or Imperatives alone.
A combination of two verb forms is needed jn order to distinguish between
classes 2 and 3, which are tonally homophonous in their Infinitive and
Imperative plural forms, or between classes 3 and 4, which are tonally
homophonous in the Imperative singular.
Verb class 1 (v./).
All verbs with a Low tone on the verb root in the Infinitive or in the Imperative
belong to verb class 1.

7.4.2.3 Subclasses According to Transitivity
Verb classes 2a, 2b, 3, and 4 are further subdivided in order to account for
their different tonal behaviour in several forms. Transitivity is the parameter
which correlates with this division into two subclasses each.
The subdivision of classes 2a, 2b, and 4 into transitive and intransitive verbs _
is needed only to account for tonal differences on the nominalised verb stem
(NOM2) used following a certain set of auxiliary verbs (sce 7.6.4.2). The
auxiliary verb used in the examples is -ada ‘CONSEC’.                            a
Verb classes 2a.tr: a-, I-, and U-initial verbs and 2b: O-initial verbs in NOM2.
The verb root has a Low tone.

        . ndid’     akpe                       - and then he whistled, NOM2
Verb class 3 is also subdivided into v.3.ur and v.37. However, the NOM2 forms
are identical in these two subclasses. The differences in their conjugations are
found   in the    Narrative,       the        two   Future   tenses,   the   Past   Continuous,   the
Subjunctive, and the NOMI                form (used in the Present Continuous) as follows:

The following verbs are homophonous in the Infinitive and Imperative forms
(both are given to show that they belong to class 3). Because of the fact that
One of each pair is transitive and the other intransitive, they belong to different
subclasses, with different tones on the verb root in certain tense forms.

on the tense/aspect forms being presented. Any mention of v.2a, v.2b, v.3, OF

7.5 Negation
An introduction to the system of negation and negative markers is necessary
at this point since the distinction between Perfective and Imperfective aspect,
presented in the following section, 7.6, correlates with the use of different
negative markers,                                                      =o)
Even though only two negative markers function in the Perfective-Imperiective
aspectual system, the complete sct of three negative markers is presented here,
with details about their position in the sentence and their distribution with
different paradigms,
Ngiti   has    three   negative   markers;   inzi,   inzé,   and   imba.   When   used
sentence-initially, they are mostly used in their disyllabic form. When used
non-initially, the initial vowel i- is deleted, a feature found with all I-initial
words, see also 2.2. The resultant forms are nzi, nza, mba.

marker automatically moves to the post-verbal position, It is also possible to
place the negative marker at the beginning, with the temporal modifier in final

7.6 Verbal    Inflection
Ngiti verb forms can be divided into Indicative and Subjunctive mood, The
Subjunctive is only used following a few subordinating conjunctions and
particles. The Subjunctive paradigm (which takes the subject concord marker
r- following all pronouns in the long form) is presented in 7.6.3 below.
All other inflected forms belong to the Indicative mood and can be divided into
two aspects: Perfective and Imperfective, This distinction correlates with the use
of the two negative markers inzi and inzé. The first one, inzi, is the negative
marker used with the Imperfective aspect; inz4 correlates. with the Perfective
aspect, The different tense forms belonging to the Perfective aspect are presented
in 7.6.1; those of the Imperfective aspect are treated in 7.6.2 below.
Other temporal or aspectual distinctions may be marked by certain verbs initiating
serial verb constructions or by the use of auxiliary verbs followed by a nominalised
verb stem as complement. The first category is briey mentioned in 7.6.1.1 since
any non-initial verb ina serial verb construction is always found in the Perfective
Present. Auxiliary verbs followed by nominalised verb stems are treated in the
section on complex verbal constructions, 7.6.4 below. Two categories of nominal-
ised verb stems are distinguished according to tonal configurations.
The negative marker has been chosen as criterion for the aspectual distinction
rather than the tone on the stem-initial vowel or the suffixes for the different
tenses, because it correlates with a semantic distinction between sets of varb
tenses whose action is already or is not yet completed, giving rise to the
Perfective and Imperfective aspects respectively,

  One may consider Perfective Present an “apparently
                                                           contradictory combination

The stem-initial vowel has a particular tone  for cach  tense   paradigm: Low,
Mid, or High. This tone is constant across all verb classes

concord marker m- 1SG is toneless, so that the tone of the stem-initial vowel
surfaces unaltered. Since the Subjunctive appears in subordinate clauses, the
subject concord marker is a toneless r-. The nominalised verb stems follow an
auxiliary form and never take a subject concord marker.

The consonantal subject concord markers preceding the stem-initial vowel are
toneless, However, the subject/object clitics do have an inherent tone. Different

verbs of class 1, which have a Low-tone verb root, it freely Muctuates with Low.

3, Suffixes
The following suffixes are used to mark tense forms: -na and -ya. The sulfix
-na occurs on different tones (L, M, or H) according to the particular tense
in which it is used. In cach case, it remains constant ‘across verb classes and
within any tense paradigm. It is used for the following tenses: Recent Past
(Low tone), Intermediate Past (High tone), Near Future (Mid tone), Past
Continuous (Mid tone), and Past Habitual (Low tone), The suffix -ya (Mid
tone) is used to mark Distant Future only, The semi-vowel y is fading out with
a number of speakers in fast speech and between certain vowels.

Used independently, the Perfective Present indicates an action which has been
completed in the present or in the very immediate past: “just now’.
The Perfective Present is also used in serial verb constructions. The first verb
in a serial verb construction is inflected for tense/aspect. Any following verb
is found in the Perfectiye Present and carries a subject clitic which is often
(but not necessarily) identical to the subject of the initial verb. Both negative
markers inz& and inzi are attested with the Perfective Present when used as
second or subsequent verb in a serial verb construction.

          The-Narrative Tense is used in narrative discourse in the first main clause of
          each sentence which follows the story line. Any subsequent verbs in the
          sentence, also following the story linc, are in the Perfective Present, which
          also serves as a Consecutive. The Narrative Tense can therefore only be used
          once in a sentence,
          A few exceptions have been found where the tone of the verb root is different
          from the expected system laid out above.
          In the Narrative tense, the verbs irata ‘to come’ and itsita ‘to fall’ v.Ja have
          a Mid tone on the verb root, rather than a Low tone, as all other verbs in
          class 1.

          Four verbs belonging to class v.3.r take a Low tone on the verb root, rather
          than a Mid tone.

                                                     presented together since they
 are tonally identical; the only difference is the
                                                     suffix -na or -ya.
 Since the Imperative is also negated with     inzi,   the negative marker for the
 Imperfective aspect, the first subsection below
                                                      deals with the Imperative: in
 more detail than 7.3 above, where the basic

                                                       on into four main classes,
 7.6.2.1 The Imperative
The Imperative has three forms: 2SG,
                                     IPL.INCL, and 2PL.
                                                      The forms used                   —
for 2SG and 2PL indicate a command to one
                                          or more people respectively,
whereas       the form   for 1PL could be considered an exhortatio
inclusive,
                                                                   n   to “us-all”’;
The negative Imperative is formed with the
                                             negative marker inzt preceding
the Imperative verb form. Additional particles
                                                which are used for negative
commands or prohibitions are presented

The Imperative forms can be followed by s morpheme -na. Whereas the
regular forms of the Imperative express a command or order, the forms
followed by -na are polite forms, expressing a respectful exhortation, The
following two contrastive sets serve as example.

 non-initial position in the sentence (except when       preced ed by the negative
 marker inzi), whereas the vowel-initial Imperative

high-frequency verbs belonging to class v.Ja. The irregularity is found in the
tone on the verb root, which has a Mid tone instead of a Low tone; the tones
on the stem-initial vowel and the suffix are according to the regular pattern.

7.6.2.3 The     Past Continuous
The Past Continuous indicates an action which was ongoing at some point in
the past. With respect to tone on the stem-initial vowel, tone on the verb root
in all classes, and the vowel change O- =» a-, it is identical to the Narrative
Past Tense. There are two differences with the Narrative Past Tense:
    1. whereas inzé is the negative marker used for the Narrative Past Tense,
        the negative Past Continuous is formed with the negative marker inzi,
        and
    2. the Past Continuous         has a suffix -na, whereas the Narrative Past has
       no suffix.
It has the following features:
1, Tone on the stem-initial vowel: Mid
The tonal realisations resulting from the combinations of subject clitics with
Low or Low-Mid tone or the Higb-tone resumptive marker and the Mid tone
on the stem-initial vowel are as follows:
        Ll      +M--        LM
        LM      +M-—--      LM
        H       +M-         HM
3These are the same verbs as the ones with lonal exceptions in the Narrative tense, 7.6.1.2.

 7.6.3 The Subjunctive
 There is one Subjunctive paradigm. The
                                          Subjunctive is a dependent form in
 that it can only be used in subordinat
                                        e clauses, following a limited set of
 introductory verb forms, conjunctions
                                       or particies.
 There are both long forms and short forms
                                              of cach paradigm.  Since  they occur
 exclusively in subordinate clauses,
                                      the subject concord marker r- is
 following the pronoun for all persons inste                                  used
                                             ad of the different subject concord
markers are used,
The Subjunctive is used in the following
                                                  environments:
 1, after Gbha, Imperative of the verb ubhi

 The nominalised verb consists of the stem

 lexical object in the case of a transitive verb.
 The nominalised verb stem has the following
                                             features:
 1. Tone on the stem-initial vowel:

The following is an example of a transitive verb in the Present Continuous,
first without and then with the resumptive marker. The object precedes the
main verb.

In the case of transitive verbs, the auxiliary form and the nominalised verb
stem are separated from cach other by the object. The two arc, however,
juxtaposed in the case of intransitive verbs, whereby the vowel 4 of the
auxiliary verb is deleted, The tone normally found on the auxiliary verb (High)
now merges with the Low tone on the verb root and yields H as surface
realisation (H + L —+ H). The result of the sequence LM (ri) followed by

In the case of transitive verbs, the auxiliary and the nominalised verb are
separated from each other by the object. The two are, however, juxtaposed
in the tase of intransitive verbs, whereby the final vowel 4 of the auxiliary
verb is deleted. The tone normally found on the last syllable of the auxiliary
verb (High) now merges with the Low tone on the verb root and yields H as
surface realisation (H + L — H).

The   auxiliary    verbs   -itdé and   -Ambé   have   no infinitive     forms.   They       are,
however, inflected for tense/aspect. On the basis of these inflected forms, an
original infinitive and verb class can be posited: *itdéta, v.Ja, and *ambéta,
v.Ja, In any tense form, they are followed by the nominalised-1 form of the
verb stem, which may be preceded by the object when it is. transitive.

7.1.2 Attributive, Locative, and Possessive Clauses
The verb ifita ‘to be' can be followed by a modifier or a postpositional phrase.
The resulting constructions are attributive, locative, and possessive clauses.
The attributive clauses in the first paradigm are formed with the noun modifiers
fdréngba ‘big.sc’ and ddrsdr5 ‘big.PL”. Locative clauses can be formed with
a locative modifier or with a postpositional phrase. A variety of examples is
used. A possessive clause is formed by a form of the verb #ita ‘to be’, followed
by a postpositional phrase ending in na ‘with’. The whole construction of Vita
‘to be’ followed by ma ‘with’ can be translated by ‘to have’.
In the following paradigms, the forms of the verb ‘to be’ are marked for person
by subject concord markers in the same way as all other verbs. Regular
inflected stems of the verb #ita are used, with in the Perfective Present the
optional use of an abbreviated stem alongside the complete stem: <i and 4.
       ma     mi     adréngbi         — ma mii          aAdrangba   Tam big

       mi mi itse                      we are far away
The resumptive marker ni is optionally present following the 3SG and 3PL
non-logophoric pronouns:
       ka (ni) 1 idza                  he is. at home
       abadhi (ni) ri itse             he is: far away
       abadhi (ni) ri akekpa           they are small
The   negative of attributive, locative and    possessive clauses is formed   with
imba. It is found as mba (I-deletion) when it immediately follows the verb
form and as imba sentence-initially. The negative marker imba docs not cause
inversion of subject and verb in the way inzi does in predicate nominals.
       ma mi mba fidringba             Tam not big, or
       imba ma mi ddringba             [am not big
       nyt nyt mbii idzi               you are not in the house
       imbi nyi nyi idz4               you are not in the house
        ngbangba ri mba andi na        the child is not ill
       jmba ngbangba ri andi na = the child is not ill
When the paradigms with the regular form in the Perfective Present are
negated, and the negative marker follows the verb, it splits the verb form as
follows:
        Affirmative:    ma mi't idza              l am_at home
        Negative:       ma mj mba ¥idzi           =] am not at home, or
                        imba ma m¥i idzi        = |. nm not at home
The forms for other tense paradigms are regular in that they use regularly
inflected paradigms of the verb #ita (with the tonal exception on the Future

i   7.8.1.2 Pluractional
    The second category within the topic of verbal plurality concerns both transitive
    and intransitive verbs. Plural action is indicated by a stem-initial vowel U-; the
    base form, with singular meaning as opposed to its plural counterpart, can
    have any of the four vowel prefixes, a-, I-, O-, or U-.
    Collective-and Distributive Plurality
    Newman coined the term “pluractional” to refer to the set of verb stems
    whose specific semantic component indicates plural action as opposed to
    singular action for the base form. “Although pluractional verbs sometimes
    relate to plurality of a nominal argument in the sentence (e.g subject, direct
    object, even indirect object), the essential semantic characteristic of such verbs
    is almost always plurality or multiplicity of the verb’s action” (Newman,
    1990:53-4}.

       Doke (1931:139) mentions the existence of a diminutive derivation in the verbal
       system of Zulu: ‘The diminutive form of the verb, formed by a reduplication
       of the stem, indicates a diminution of the action, ‘to do a little’.” Even though
                                                                                   means,

       the diminutive derivation also covers the semantic aspect of inceptive,

 The presence of diminutive verb stems does not exclude        the  existenc e of
 pluractional stems (marked by U-). One example has been found
                                                                       of  a verb

 7.8.6 O-Initial and a-Initial Verb Stems
It was mentioned above (7.8) that in general, if a verb has an O-initial or an
a-initial stem, that stem represents the base form from which other stems  may
be derived. A verb root containing the vowel a always has a stem-initial
                                                                             a,
Verb roots with any other vowel may have O- or a- as stem-initial vowel.
                                                                         In
most cases, there is only one verb stem: either with O- or with a- stem-initially,
There are, however, about twenty roots which are found both with stem-initial
O- and a-, and whose meanings are closely related. It does not seem possible
to state unambiguously whether the O-initial stem or the a-initial stem is the
base form in these cases. A closer Jook at these pairs shows that some may
be used interchangeably; in other cases, there are semantic  difference s similar
to the ones found in the derivational system described above, and in yet
                                                                            other
cases, the meanings have diverged and one of the two is used in a very specific
context. Further study needs to concentrate on exploring the range of
collocations of each of these verbs. The following serve as examples.

A major division into two classes of postpositions can be made: postpositions
which take a nominal element as modifier: noun, noun phrase, or pronoun
(8.2), and postpositions which take an oblique phrase as modifier: a temporal
or locative modifier, or a postpositional phrase (8.3).
The first group of postpositions, those functioning with a nominal modifier,
needs to be subdivided into two classes according to the set of pronouns used
as modifier in the postpositiona) phrase. Firstly, non-derived postpositions take
the regular personal pronouns as modifiers (8.2.1). The other class consists of
inalienable nouns functioning as postpositions. They are modified by the set
of inalienable possessive pronouns (8.2.2). The resultant postpositional phrase
is tonally different from # noun phrase. In addition, there are a few
postpositions with irregular paradigms when modified by a pronoun (8.2.3).
When     modified by a noun or noun     phrase, however, both the non-derived
postpositions and those derived from inalienable nouns immediately follow the
noun or noun phrase and there is no apparent distinction between these two
ciasses of postpositions,
For clarity of description, the postpositions derived from inalienable nouns are
subdivided into three sections. The first group consists of three postpositions
derived from body parts, which have two tonally contrastive forms each. The
difference can be explained in terms of directional versus locational and
general location versus specific location (8.2.2.1). The second group consists
of five locative inalienable nouns which function as postpositions (8.2.2.2).
Finally, there are a few compound postpositions whose second element is a
postposition derived from an inalienable noun (8.2.2.3). Features like vowel
height assimilation and [ATR] harmony are mentioned whenever applicable.
Posipositional phrases must be nominalised when they function in a nominal
slot (8.4). Within the clause, they may function as subject or object. Certain
verbs require their subject or object to be a nominalised postpositional phrase.
Nominalised postpositional phrases may also function within a postpositional
phrase or an alienable possessive construction. For examples, sce 5.11.34.

compound postpositions (2.2.3).

       {In morphological terms, the difference can be explained as a Low tone on the
  basic form of each of the three postpositions and the addition of a floating
 ') High tone, producing a LM rising tone, on the second form of each of the
   > postpositions. The floating High tone should be considered a separate
      postposition since it can also be attached to adverbial modifiers (see 8.3 below).
           In certain environments,        the two    tonally    contrastive   forms   are mutually

    The   two tonally contrastive       forms     are more       frequently   found   in identicat
    environments with verbs which indicate a position at.a particular place (i'ita
    ‘to be at’, idéta “to stand, stay’). Semantically, the difference between the two
    tonally contrastive forms in this type of identical environment can be stated
    in terms of general (GEN) versus specific (SPEC); the basic form with the
    Low tone indicates the place in general; the form with the LM tone points
    to a precise or well-defined place, whether explicitly mentioned, or implicitly
    Supposed to be understood because the speaker expects the hearer to know.

                  e ouns have extended their meaning and are used jin a
wider range of contexts as postpositions. The borderline between locative
nouns and postpositions is not very sharp since they are tonally identical. The
criterion must be the shift of meaning and the range of contexts in which they
are used,
                    Locative Nouns         Postpositions:
       -li          in the mouth of        in front of
       +3           son the body of        against
       -ti          sin the proximity of   close to, next to
In addition, there are two postpositions in this set whose nominal origin cannot
be traced:
       -onzi                               in front of
       -tsi                                under, below
The first one, li ‘in the mouth’, is not used widely as a postposition. Combined
with a possessive pronoun, it follows its primary meaning:
       ma      mi         makyi nidba               lida
       ma m+        miakyi wm -dhd                  li    -di

       Zam retaining milk in my mouth
As postposition with a nominal modifier, li is nearly exclusively used in
combination with the noun idza ‘house’: idza-li , which literally means ‘in front
of the house’, ie., in the courtyard, The locative construction idza-li can then
be nominalised, idza-li-nga, to designate the noun ‘courtyard’. The postposition
li is theoretically productive in that it can be combined with other nouns. Some
examples are given, but in actual practice these are rare.

possessive pronouns. In the same way as with compound nouns whose first

placed between the two elements of the compound postposition (cf. also 5.6.1).

The postposition bha is derived from the adverb ibha ‘at home’, In its
postpositional function, it is tonally marked by a Low tone, in the same way
as the postpositions derived from inalienable nouns mentioned above. It is
used to mark presence at or movement towards a [+ human]                          referent, in the
singular only (with bva/byé as plural counterpart). The same postposition bha
is also used in possessive constructions marking singular possessor, As
possessive   marker,     it can     be     seen        as   marking    a   postpositional   phrase
functioning as noun modifier within the alienable possessive construction (ste

The postpositions 13 and t5 are used in different syntactic constructions, The
former, t5, is used for postpositional phrases marking an indirect object. It can
be preceded by nouns, or by the pronouns derived from nouns (abadhi,
iyadhiya, alé, abadhi), and the 3SG pronoun ka. For 1SG/PL, 2SG/PL, and
3SG/PL.LOG followed by t3, there are suppletive forms used as indirect object
pronouns (see 6.4).
The Jatter, t5, is mainly found in possessive constructions, marking plural or      —
non-countable/abstract possessor (cf. bha as singular possessor). It also occurs     —
following nominalised verbs (the infinitive form marked by -ta in the example
below). It is found with nouns as well as with pronominal referents, In the
latter case, it behaves similarly to its counterpart t3 in that it forms regular         —
constructions with the pronouns derived from nouns,              and   suppletive
constructions in 1SG/PL, 2SG/PL, and 3SG/PL.LOG.

9.2.1 Modifiers
There is no morphological nor a clear syntactic distinction between a class of
adjectives and # class of adverbs in Ngiti. The functional term modifiers js
therefore used in this section to cover.a fairly large grammatical class of words, —
containing about 150 items, which are neither nouns nor verbs and which al]                  7
have a modifying function in relation to different constituents. They are not
verbs in that they are not inflected for tense, They are not nouns either, since
they cannot function as head of a nominal phrase unless they are explicitly
nominalised.
The class of modifiers comprises all and only those words which can be
nominalised (see 5.11.3). The only exception to this are three words which
cannot be nominalised, and which can only be used as noun modifiers: ngafe
‘some’, ngatsi ‘other.sG', and ngikpa ‘other.PL’. Any other words traditionally
classified as adverbs   but which cannot    be nominalised,    are treated      in the
section on particles (9.7.1 below),
Modifiers have scope over nouns, verbs, or clauses, Because of semantic
restrictions, some modifiers have scope over nouns-only; others may function
exclusively with verbs or clauses.
Many modifiers, however, are very flexible semantically, and can function hoth
as noun and as verb or clause modifier. Their meanings diverge somewhat,
but   the   common   core   meaning   remains   transparent,   In   addition,    some
modifiers can take both temporal and Jocative meaning.
The following are examples of modifiers which function both as temporal and
as locative clause modifiers.

Numerals and other quantifiers, which semantically must relate to a noun, are
somewhat freer with respect to word order. In addition to the prenominal
position, they are also found in other word-order configurations; the adjunct
positions clause-initially and clause-finally. In clause-final and clause-initial
position, the numeral has more emphasis than in the unmarked Position,
preceding the noun. A discontinuous noun phrase is created when the numeral
is separated from the noun.

Other modifiers, namely those that have scope over verbs or clauses, take the
adjunct positions, clausc-initially or clause-finally, in the same way that
postpositional phrases do, Clause-initially, there is one adjunct position; two
successive    adjuncts   -   modifiers        or   postpositional   phrases   -   may   occur
clause-finally. Manner adverbials normally have scope over verbs, whereas
locative and temporal modifiers function at clause Jevel.

Even though they relate to nouns in whatever position in the clause they Occur,
some of the numerals have two tonally distinct forms according to the position
in the clause they take: one form for the prenominal position, another form
for the adjunct position (see 9.3.1.2).
9.2.L.2 Morphological Structure
In addition to a number of CVCY         modifiers and some compounded    forms,
the following structures are worth specific mention.
A number of modifiers have the basic VCV-structure also found with members
of the other open classes, nouns and verbs, Certain tone patterns occur which
are not found with the nouns and verbs: H.LM and M.L, The initial vowel is
a-, I-, or Q-, as with the nouns. The following serve as example.

     9,2.1.3.2 Intensification
     Several VCV modifiers can be intensified by tripling the CV-syllable. As with
     reduplicated plurals, this is not a fully productive feature. Tonally, the following
     two patterns are observed: triplicate CVCVCV-forms derived from a M.H
     VCV-structure        have   a H.HLH   tone     pattern;   those   derived   from   a L.LM
     VCV-structure, have a L.H.H tone pattern. The following serve as examples:

9.2.2 Other modifying strategies
In addition to the class of modifiers used as noun, verb, or:clause modifiers,
the language has two other strategics by which nouns can be modified:
inalienable possessive constructions and verbal modifiers. Verb or clause
modification can also be expressed by means of postpositional phrases. All
three are briefly exemplified in the following sections.
9.2.2.1 Inalienable Possessive Construction
Inalienable nouns functioning as head of an inalienable possessive construction
may semantically serve to modify that noun, These inalienable nouns differ
from the regular modifiers in that they follow the noun they modify and that
they cannot undergo the process of nominalisation, since in themselves they
are already nominals (see also. 5.5.1).

       idre                        ten
The following remarks can be made:
1. The form Aré ‘eight’ also appears in &rabhé ‘seven’ and ardgyétdi ‘nine’,
2. The form araébha ‘seven’ seems in fact a combination of ar’ ‘eight’ followed
by ibhw ‘three’. If we look at the traditional numeral system, 9.3.1.3 below,
there is a morpheme, -vi, which marks ‘lacking one’, or ‘one below’ the numeral
to which it is attached, from otsi ‘twelve’ onward (otsi-vi, 12-1=11). In the
case of arébhé ‘seven’, ibhw may have taken on the same function: its originat
meaning being ‘three’, ic, one below the first unit of four. Following that,
attached to aré ‘eight’, which is the next unit of four, its meaning is ‘lacking
one’, in this case from eight, ie., seven.
3, The etymology of ‘nine’ is a bit clearer. The recognisable parts of ardgyétdi
are aré ‘cight’, and -tdi, ‘one’, which together make up ‘nine’. The middie
part, -gyé-, is not entirely clear. Some suggest that it originates from -do, ‘head,
on’, which is pronounced gyo in the northern speech variety. Influenced by
the [+ATR] front vowel in -tdi, gyo acquires a [+ ATR] front vowel, thereby
keeping its original vowel height: gye. There is free variation in fast speech
between dragyétdi and drigyétdi. In the latter form even the antepenultimate
syllable has exchanged its back vowel for a front yowel.
9.3.1.2 Word   Order
The unmarked listing order in counting items is numeral-noun. However, in
connected speech and in written texts, the numeral can both precede or follow
the noun it modifies, or even be found in clause-initial position, separated
from the noun altogether. The different word orders signal different degrees
of emphasis. Numeral-noun is the unmarked order with the least emphasis,
noun-numeral is slightly emphasised, and the numeral in clause-initial position
is the most emphatic.

            Swahili words mia and elfu, All three loan words have a M.L tone pattern
            and, Jike kumi, function as nouns which are modified by other numerals, as
            follows:
                     atdi miyi       = one hundred

            Longer numerals can be made up, c.g.,
                   atdi miya djna ibbe kumi djnf aza na                 = 136

            In the market place, when dealing with money, people mostly use Swahili or
            French these days, especially with the high inflation rate, which results in
            having to count in hundreds of thousands and millions.
            9.3.2 Ordinal Numbers
            Ordinal numbers are made up of a syntactic construction consisting of a clause
            with the verb isété ‘to increase’.

    |              idre ri kist ale                 the tenth person
        |   A literal translation of these noun phrases which in fact contain a relative
            clause preceding the head, is: ‘the cow which one adds to be two’, ‘the house
            which one adds to be four’, ‘the child which one adds to be five’, etc.

9.3.3.2 Numerals followed by rd
Both the simple numerals and the reduplicated numerals can be followed by
the postposition rd ‘away from’ in a postpositional phrase. In the case of the
simple numerals, one group of the appropriate number        is meant; whenever
the numeral is reduplicated, it concerns several groups of the particular number
mentioned; several groups of two, several piles of three etc.

9.4.1 Structure
9.4.1.L Inflection
Verbal modifiers can be found in any one of nine tense/aspect forms. Withia
the Perfective aspect, they have been attested in Perfective Present (PF.PR),
the three Past tenses (PAST 1, 2, and 3), and in the Narrative tense (NAR)
Within the Imperfective aspect, inflected verbal modifiers are found in the
Past Continuous (PAST.CNT) and the two Future tenses (FUT 1 and 2) as
well asin the Present Continuous (PR.CNT), a complex verbal construction
