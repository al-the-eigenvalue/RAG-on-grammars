"         In this grammar I assume that the question of whether a language has two systemsof syntagmatic organization (even if they overlap or display fuzziness at their boundaries)is an empirical question that should be assessed for each language (Haspelmath 2011;Tallman & Epps forthcoming). I, therefore, take it as the null hypothesis that anyarchitectural division between morphotactics and syntax in a language is arbitrary, unlessthe distinction can be motivated empirically.",[156]

"       1.8.4 Dynamic interviews
Dynamic interviews involve two or more participants where one participant asks questionsrelated to common Chácobo cultural activities (when was the last time you went fishing?what did you catch?), questions that are meant to elicit narratives at different temporaldistances from the speech time (what were you doing about a month ago? What were you

doing two weeks ago? What do you plan to do tomorrow/in a week?), and questions thatare meant to elicit speaker perspectives (recount a story that you heard that you don'tbelieve is true and explain why? Have you ever seen a ghost? How did you know it was aghost?). Some of the questions were about stories that had already been relayed to myinterviewing consultants earlier. The interviewing consultants were instructed to attemptto maintain a dialogue with the other speakers in order to record more conversationalspeech. Ostensibly the purpose of recording discourse at distinct temporal distances was tobetter understand how tense, aspect, temporal adverbials, and temporal distancemorphemes (or “graded tense” morphemes) were encoded, and their relationship toperspectival meanings such as reported evidentials and assertive modals. This wasimportant because the corpus developed from the first year of fieldwork was biased towardstraditional folk stories, which are always in the remote past. The aforementioned interviewswere designed to gather more data about the use of temporal distance morphemes in thedistant and recent past times, and the crasternal (“tomorrow”) and remote future times.","[68, 69]"

           4.2.2.3. Other functions of the interrogativeIn Chácobo, interrogative clause-types have a number of related functions apart fromasking for information. As noted in Erikson (2010), questions are used as a form of greetingand for other social conventions in Chácobo (and Matis). Such expressions diverge fromthe prototypical use of an interrogative as inquiring about information because the answerto the question is always obvious from context. For instance, (4.101) is typically utteredwhen someone is done eating and it is obvious. The sentence in (4.102) is always utteredas a greeting at the beginning of the day. The sentence in (4.103) is uttered when thespeaker can clearly see that her interlocutor has arrived.(4.101)        bɨso=ʔá               mi-a               awake=INTER:P          2SG-EPEN               ‘Are you awake?’           OBSV(4.102)        mi         pi=ʔá               2SG        eat=INTER:P               ‘Did you finish eating?’    OBSV(4.103)        ho=ʔá              mi-a               arrive=INTER:P      2SG-EPEN               ‘Have you arrived?’         OBSV

          Interrogatives are also used for exclamative expressions in Chácobo. This isillustrated in (4.104). The exclamative expression typically combines an interrogativeexpression such as hawɨ ‘what, who’ with an adjective as in tio-ria ‘very big’.(4.104)       hawɨ́     tió-ria     ní        páitʃe         tʃaʔíta              what      big-AUG      INTER      paiche          big              ‘How big the paiche is!’                    TXT 109:051          Conjectural questions are also a way in which interrogative constructions candiverge from their prototypical function. The Chácobo frequently use interrogative clause-type for rhetorical effect as is illustrated in (4.105).(4.105)          náa                      tsɨmo=kaná=tsi=ʔikiá                   hawɨniá                 DEM1                      get_dark=GOING:ITR:SG=NOW:ITR=REP        where                 oʂa=ʔiní                 ɨ-a=rɨ́                 sleep=INTER:NONP          1SG-A=REG                 ‘At this point it was getting darker it is said “Where am I going to sleep?!","[276, 277, 278]"

40 A reasonable question arises as to why the experiential reading (as it is described above) is considered a
perfect reading at all. The reason for this is primarily typological in that constructions that encode otherperfect readings cross-linguistically can sometimes also encode an experiential reading (Matthewson 2016).",[789]

"         4.2.2 Interrogatives            4.2.2.1. Interrogatives - IntroductionAn interrogative refers to a grammatical structure which encodes typically that a speakeris requesting information from a hearer (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 178). In Chácobo, theinterrogative clause-type has a number of other functions apart from requestinginformation, such as exhortation, greetings and expressions of regret. Typologically, twotypes of interrogative constructions are typically recognized; polar and constituentinterrogatives. Polar interrogatives elicit a yes or no answer and constituent interrogativesquestion some particular part of a sentence (König & Siemund 2007: 291). There is astructural distinction between polar and constituent interrogatives in Chácobo. Cross-classifying the distinction between polar and constituent interrogatives is the distinction

"         Currently in linguistic science there is no agreed upon phonetic criterion or testfor distinguishing stress and tone. Intuitively tone should be distinguished based on pitchand stress based on some combination of acoustic correlates. To my knowledge, however,there has been little or practically no attention paid to the statistical relationship betweentone categories and other potential correlates besides pitch. For instance, is it incorrect torefer to prominence 1 as “tone” (as is done in this thesis) because vowel duration alsoplausibly plays a role in marking high tone bearing versus toneless syllables? Since themultivariate structure of phonological categories has not been investigated in the literatureand plays no part in current “word prosodic typologies” (e.g. Hyman 2006, 2009), there iscurrently no way to answer this question. Based on the phonetics it is not clear whetherChácobo should be regarded as a system that distinguishes two types of stress, two typesof tone, or a mixed tone stress system. In this dissertation I assume that Chácobo can bedescribed as a mixed tone-stress system, but I emphasize that it is not motivated by thephonetics of this language.",[144]
"
16 I cannot confidently say at this point which pattern of combination with respect to position 3 suffixes is
the most common, because I have not conducted a statistical analysis of the lexicon. It is my impression thatthe most common pattern is that roots do not combine these suffixes. The roots that require transitivitysuffixes appear to be the oldest in the sense that my experience suggests one is more likely to find cognatesbetween these roots another verb roots of other Pano languages. This question requires future research.",[311]
"While such interviews were meant to capture more interactional speech, it should be notedthat it is difficult to separate interactional speech registers and monologues at all in mycorpus. The reason is that even in oral histories and folk stories, where one might expectlonger uninterrupted monologues, the Chácobo consistently engage in conversationthroughout, asking clarifying questions to the main speaker, and sometimes stopping todiscuss interpretation of a story in the case of folk stories.",[69]

"       This morphosyntactic distinction begs the question as to whether there are semanticdifferences between the two reportatives.

This section reports the results ofapplication of semantic and pragmatic tests on reportatives in the literature concerningwhether the reportative should be regarded as a modal or an evidential. I report theapplication of these tests across the three construction types described above in Sections13.16.1-13.16.6. A summary of the results are provided in 13.16.7.

         nouns, verbs (Section 5.3.1),        Lexical                   Open         adjectives (Section 5.3.2)         adverbs (Section 5.3.3)              Semi-lexical function     Semi-Open         associated motion, temporal          Semi-lexical function     Closed         distance, perspectival         (evidentiality, modality,         mirativity), quantifiers,         interrogative phrases         post-positions, case, participant    Functional                Closed         agreement, subordinators,         possessive markers, number,         tense, aspect, clause-type       Before describing the part-of-speech classes in Chácobo, a terminologicalclarification is in order. There are some roots that can function in more than one class at atime. For instance, the root íbo ‘owner (n.), to own (v.)’ in Chácobo can function as a nounor a verb, where it refers to an ‘owner (n.)’ or a transitive predicate ‘to own something (v.)’respectively. There are two ways of describing such a situation. One way is by referring toa process called zero-derivation, that derives one of the part-of-speech categories from the                                             132
others. For instance, one could consider the noun function of ibo ‘owner’ to constitute itsunderlying meaning. The verb function ‘to own something’ could be derived from the nounthrough zero-derivation. Another way of describing such cases is by positing that such aroot is lexically flexible between verb and noun classes. In this grammar, I use theterminology of lexical flexibility to describe such cases. The reason is that I see this conceptas capturing distinct degrees of autonomy that different part-of-speech classes exhibit vis-à-vis other part of speech classes. For instance, adverbs are a much less robust grammaticalclass because, overall, they display a high degree of lexical flexibility with a number ofdifferent part-of-speech classes. This terminological choice should not be seen as atheoretical decision, however. I am not claiming that an analysis that posits zero-derivationor perhaps differentiates it in some way from lexical flexibility is incompatible with thedata in Chácobo (see the papers in Rijkhoff and van Lier [2013] on this question).","[174, 175, 176]"

This is not a syntactic requirement of the imperfective i-auxiliaryconstruction. For example, in (4.71), where the subject pronominal ɨ ‘first person singular’precedes the entire auxiliary verb construction (see Sections 7.1.1.2 and 7.2.1.3 for thealignment properties of this construction).(4.71)          tʃani          siri                 yoa=ʔai=ka                story          old                  tell=NMLZ:IMPFV=REL                ɨ              nika=ʔi              i=pao=ní=kɨ                1SG            listen=SS            AUX=HAB=REMP=DEC:P                ‘I was always listening to the the old story that she (my grand mother) was                telling’ TXT 022:027

         The next auxiliary verb construction is the regretative i-auxiliary verbconstruction. In this construction the auxiliary is i ‘intransitive’, the negative/antonymic=ma combines with the main lexical verb, and the modal enclitic =rɨ́ ‘regretative’ occursdirectly after the clause type/rank morpheme =kɨ ‘declarative, past time’ (see Section13.14). This construction type refers to a counterfactual event that the speaker regrets orlaments not performing. In Spanish, it is often translated as a question that a speaker posesto oneself. An example of this auxiliary construction is provided in (4.72a) with some ofthe discourse contact in (4.72a).(4.72)    a.   haatia          yáwa                        haská-ria      tsi      kiá               EXPL:EPIS       white_lipped_peccary         similar-SIMIL   P5       REP               no-kí          ha          tsaya=ʔái=na               1PL-ACC         3           look=NMLZ:IPV=EPEN               ‘I don’t know, it seems as if the white lipped peccary were watching us.’          b.   papa= ́             pía     wɨstí        bɨ-ma              ɨ               father=GEN          arrow    one           bring-NMLZ:NEG     1SG               i=ʔita=kɨ=rɨ́                      yáwa                     wɨstí               AUX=RECP=DEC:P=LAMENT              white_lipped_peccary      one               a(k)=ʂɨ́=na               kill=REMF=EPEN

I regret not bringing one of my father’s arrows so that I               could have killed a white lipped peccary.’) TXT 007:333-334       The marker of verbal and clausal negation is =yáma ‘negation’ in all otherconstruction types. The morpheme -ma expresses negation or antonymity when it combineswith adjectives and certain nominalized verbs. Based on the fact that -ma combines withnominalized verbs and adjectives, I interpret the -ma in the lamentative i-auxiliaryconstruction as a nominalizer. Since nominalization is a form of subordination it is on thisbasis that I classify the lamentative construction as an auxiliary construction.","[257, 258, 259, 260]"
"On the other hand, =yó ‘completive’ is indexed as “No” under this column, indicating thatit can never combine with a reduplicated verb. The morpheme =ʃina ‘at night, during thenight’ allows both possibilities and is thus indexed with “Yes/No”.",[892]

       The example in (10.44) also demonstrates that the remote future =ʂɨ́ does notdisplay discourse perseverance; it is not repeated redundantly throughout discourse. Yocauses the morpheme once in (10.44b), and does not use it in (10.44d). There are no examplesin my corpus where the same speaker repeats =ʂɨ́ redundantly throughout a narrative. Thereare a few cases (to be discussed below), where =ʂɨ́ is repeated redundantly in questionanswer pairs, but I argue that this does not count as a counter example to the lack ofdiscourse perseverance.","[867, 868]"
