        If you are not careful you can get very mixed up in these negative
questions and the unusual, though quite logical, reply, and it is better to try and
avoid them if possible.
The Thai themselves do not use the negative form of question very much in
conversation.
         These short answers given to questions in Thai sound rather abrupt
when translated into English but they are perfectly alright in Thai and you need
not be afraid to use them.
          Although we have tabulated the various forms of question and answer
above, there are no fixed rules as to when to use one or the other particular
form and in fact most of them are fairly interchangeable. Once you have had a
little practice in the language you will have no difficulty in forming an appro-
priate reply to any question.","[196, 197]"
"15. A. 1. “Yes” and “No”.
         There are no two words in Thai which can be considered as being the
equivalents of “Yes” and “No” in English and plain affirmative and negative
answers are given in a variety of ways depending on the way in which the
question is asked.
        This fact usually causes difficulty to the foreigner who is accustomed to
using “Yes” and “No” quite freely in a large number of sentences where they
are in many cases fairly redundant and are merely added for emphasis or to
smooth out the sentence and make it sound less abrupt.
          You have already seen some of the ways in which Thai people give
affirmative and negative answers and we will now bring all these and some
other forms together for comparison.
         (a) In Lesson 1 you had CHY “it is” and MY CHY “it is not”, but
             these two words are often used alone in sentences where in Eng-
             lish we would also add “Yes” or “No”.

                  luhniu            As a general rule, if a question ends in CHY MY the best answer
            is either CHY or MY CHY
            Similarly, if the question ends in DY MY, the answer will generally
            be either D Y or MY DY.

(b) Another common way of rendering “Yes” or “No” in answering
    a question is merely to repeat the verb on its own for the
    affirmative or the verb preceded by the negative word MY for
    the negative.","[194, 195]"
"          There are many exceptions to the above general rules on question
words and in many cases alternative forms of question are equally acceptable
just as they are in English.",[103]

        REU PLOW is mostly used in questions to which you do not know
what the answer is likely to be, i.e. questions in which in English we might end
with the words “or not?”

         REU is similar to MY but is not such a good word to use generally. In
many cases it does not sound very “polite”. It is however the general word to
use in the following circumstances.
        (a) Combined with MY CHY to mean “isri’t it? _

         (b) In negative questions

         SABAI DEE REU                  fllJWin©   Are you well?
which is generally used as a conventional greeting and corresponds to the Eng-
lish “How do you do?”
        (d) In a long drawn out form REU-U-U as an expression of surprise.
        PRALAHT J Y MAHK REU
        It is very surprising, isn’t it?
        ihmwiUinnvno
As you will see if you examine these questions, it can be broadly said that if you
use REU it usually implies that you expect an affirmative answer.
        Negative questions of the form of (b) above are not very common in
Thai and should be avoided for the present as the answer is rather tricky. See
Examples 8 and 12 Para 5 of this lesson.","[101, 102]"
"         A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of
the verb or, in certain cases, after it. (See Lesson 7.)
        When a negative word qualifies an adjective it is usually placed between
the noun and the adjective (Example 21.)
         The future tense is indicated by putting the word JA “will”, “shall”
in front of the verb.
         In most cases questions in the future tense can be answered in the
present tense.
         The answer to a question is generally made as short as possible and in
many cases will consist only of a repetition of the verb in the case of an affirma-
tive answer, or the verb preceded by a negative word in the case of a negative
answer.
         The position of adverbs and adverbial clauses is variable. Generally the
adverb of time comes at the beginning of the sentence but we can add emphasis
to it by putting it at the end.
Other adverbs and adverbial clauses may go either at the beginning or end of
the sentence but the position of each particular one is usually fairly constant.
Adverbs or adverbial clauses seldom come in the middle of a sentence. For
instance;
       “Go to the market and buy some eggs”
would be rendered in Thai as,
         “Go buy some eggs at the market”
Interrogative adverbs and some adverbs of time such as “always”, “often”,
“soon” etc. are usually placed at the end of the sentence.",[31]
Negative questions.,[196]
"The word MY expressed in a rising tone at the end of a sentence is probably
the most common interrogative word and denotes a question. Its use is analo-
gous to that of the English word “NG?” as often used by Latin peoples at the
end of a sentence in English to donate a question.",[19]
"  Whether talking English or Thai you should be very careful about asking a
Thai a negative question such as :
  MEU-A WAHN NEE KOON MY                               Yesterday you didn’t go to the

                                             LESSON 8. A.
                                          CONVERSATION8. A. 1. Question Words.
        In Lesson 1. A. we saw that an interrogative sentence was formed by
adding the interrogative word MY or the words CHY MY at the end of the
sentence.
REU and REU PLOW are two other words which are used in a similar manner.
The distinction between the various forms of question is not easy to make and
in many cases they are used alternatively but we can set out the following broad
principles as a general guide.
         MY is generally used for a direct question concerning something in
the present or future.
MY cannot be used in a negative question or in questions where the pronouns
14, 1414 or 11414 are written or implied.
In these cases we must use CHY MY (preferably) or else REU.
        KOON CHORP LEN TENNIT MY                            Do you like playing tennis?

         TiiiifitimlilimiirmlMu
               9
          CHY MY corresponds fairly closely to “is it”, “are you” “does it”
etc. and is used in sentences where we could use “is it?” in English even though
in English we would probably use a rather different form of construction.","[100, 101]"
"                                         — 87 —
This type of question will be dealt with more fully again in Lesson 15 A.","[102, 103]"
"REU ( 1 H 0 ) if it comes in the middle of a sentence usually means “or”.
You will meet it again as a question word in lesson 8.",[56]
"  KA. There are actually two words (written KA in the transliteration) used
  by women, and though there is little difference between them in normal
  conversation it is appropriate to draw attention to them at this stage. *
  KA ( f l £ ) pronounced in the high tone is normally used in questions
  and requests.
          1
  KA (f)£) pronounced in the dropped tone is used with a reply to a question
  or as an affirmative (See Lesson 15.)

         ltl«0Ulij04U10   az  PEN (11114) is used to indicate a “state of being” and in this sense can
  be translated as “is”.",[34]
"                                 — 180 —
            When talking on the telephone Thai people use these words
            KRUP and KA very frequently meaning “I understand”. Note
            that it is only when used either alone or at the beginning of a
            sentence that KRUP and KA have this meaning of “yes”.
        (d) When the question ends in REU PLOW the negative answer is
            usually either PLOW alone or PLOW followed by an amplifying
            clause.

        (e) You will occasionally meet the word JA(D ) meaning “yes” used
            similarly to PLOW “no” and usually followed by an amplifying
            clause.
           It is not a very “polite” word and is used mostly to inferiors or
           amongst intimates and it is better for you not to use it at all.","[195, 196]"
"KOR YEUM (110 0 kJ ) “borrow” and H Y YEUM “lend” both refer to borrowing

of any interest being paid.",[281]

whereas in the second and fourth example it is the negative word "" n o ” , ""not” and in Thai
is written l u   Colloquially you will very often hear DY used in sentences where it would
   strictly be more correct to use PEN.

Note.
     When referring to numbers of things or people a special form of construction is used
   which includes a ""Classifier"" or Designatory Particle"".

         (iii).   The Common Tone.
                  This is spoken in the speaker’s ordinary tone of voice without
                  any inflection. It is the tone used in English for ordinary conver-
                  sation.
                  It is indicated in the vocabularies by “c”                  Come                   MAH                   c          JJ1

                  This is a level tone with no inflection but lower in pitch than
                  common tone.
                  It is indicated in t h e vocabularies by “ 1 ”                  A flower               DORK                 1          flan

          (v). The Dropped Tone.
                  This an emphatic and heavily accented tone with a falling in flee-
                  tion and is similar to the tone iused in English to denote emphasis
                            e.g. “I told you not to go there”.
                  It is indicated in the vocabularies by “d”                  Rice                  KAOU                  d

         It should be noted that the tone applies to a syllable only so that in a
polysyllabic word each syllable may and often does have a different tone.

         You may find it difficult at first to pronounce all the syllables of a
polysyllabic word in the correct tone but luckily there are very few words of
more than two syllables where the tonal values of the syllables vary, so that even
if the tone of one or more syllables is not quite correct the combination of
syllables alone will usually distinguish the word without ambiguity. The tone
of each word in the vocabularies is indicated as shown above and the same
system is used for all words in the extended vocabulary at the end of the book
but for clarity and simplicity of printing the tones are not shown in the roma-
nized version of the examples throughout the text.","[16, 17, 18]"

                                LESSON 1. A.
                               CONVERSATION1. A. 1. (a). The Tones.
        The Thai language is a “Tonal Language” which means that a word
may have two or more distinct and quite unrelated meanings depending on the
tone in which it is pronounced.
        Altogether there are five tones but there is no single word which is
pronounced in all five although there are a number which may be pronounced
in two or three and carry a different meaning in each.
          Most newcomers to the language are rather appalled at the apparent
difficulty of the tones but they are not as hard as is generally imagined even for
people with no musical ear.
         A great many words in common use take only one tone and even where
a word has two or three tones, each with a different meaning, in most cases the
word you intend to use will be made clear by the context provided you get the
construction of the sentence right even though your tone may not be quite
correct.
         The five tones are;
          (i). The High Tone.
               This, is a uniform tone pitched well above the level of the
               speaker’s normal voice and is similar to the tone used in Eng-
                lish to denote alarm.
                          e.g. “keep away”
               It is indicated in the vocabularies by “h”                A bird                NOK                      h     un
                To love               RUK                      h     ■fn
               Small                  LEK                      h     tan
          (ii). The Rising Tone.
                This as the name implies has a rising inflection and is something
                like the tone used in English to denote surprise or a question
                          e.g. “Are you going home now ?”
                It is indicated in the vocabularies by “r”.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
