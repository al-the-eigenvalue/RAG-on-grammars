In (10.22), the place name introduces new (i.e., previously unmentioned) infor-
mation, and, therefore, functions like a polar question. But yu yu can be used
to confirm information that is not new. For example, in (10.23), which is from a
conversation, KS asserts that some children they are watching are off to fly kites.
DG responds with the newsmaker-type response token ngarrikuna (§10.2.1 above),
which functions here to seek confirmation of this assertion from KS. KS confirms
this with yu yu.","[334, 335]"
"9.5.1 NegationGarrwa has many negative constructions formed using the negative particle
miku in initial position.⁹⁴ This particle is also used as the negative exclamative
‘no’ (e.g., in negative answers to polar questions). In clausal negation, the neg-
ative particle is followed by second-position clitic elements. This is typically a
pronoun, but some modal clitics are also possible, as discussed below. The verb
usually directly follows the second-position clitic complex. Where there are no
second-position clitics (e.g., when the referent is third person singular and there-
fore unmarked), the verb may directly follow the negative particle. Otherwise the
verb typically directly follows the second-position clitics.
     In negative non-past contexts, verbs occur in the irrealis form (with -kanyi
§7.5.3)(9.95)      miku ngayu          jilaj-kanyi
            neg     1sgnom walk-irr
            ‘I’m not going.’ (Osborne 1966 field notes)
94 Speakers in Borroloola sometimes use the Yanyuwa negative form kurdardi/kudadi instead
of miku, but clearly identify miku as the Garrwa word. Uses of kudadi are usually corrected by
speakers during transcription sessions.

          ‘The snake didn’t bite me.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)To negate ability, the clitic =yi ‘neg.ability’ attaches to pronouns.(9.106)   miku      ngayi=yi                jilajba
          neg       1sgnom=neg.abil         walk
          ‘I can’t walk.’ (Hale 1962 field notes)(9.107)   miku        ngayi=yi             mili         kajurra    balkjiba

          ‘We can’t (even) go searching in the east under stones for echidna.’
          (20.6.08.KS)The deontic modal clitic =kiya (§8.1.2.2) may attach to miku in past contexts to
indicate that the event/situation did not happen, but that it should have hap-
                                                       Other sentence types       283
pened or that it didn’t happen contrary to expectations. The deontic reading is
retained in the negative reading because the meaning relates to social obliga-
tions. For example, in (9.110) below, the speaker claims that the protagonists were
not obliged to bury the dead person (because of social convention). Instead, they
hung him up in a tree.(9.109)    miku=kiya     ninji       janyba     nanda ngubungu
           neg=oblig 2sgnom throw               that  boomerang
           ‘You wouldn’t have thrown that boomerang (even though you are
           accused of doing so).’ (3.9.03.3.KS)(9.110)    miku=kiya      yalu      makaba ngala       langandaba yalu
           neg=oblig      3plnom bury         contr hang.up           3plnom
           ‘They wouldn’t have buried him, they hung him up.’ (3.9.03.3.KS)In all the examples so far, miku directly precedes the second-position pronoun
and associated clitics, and the negation has scope over the whole proposition.
When miku does not precede a pronoun, its scope narrows to negate the constitu-
ent immediately following it.(9.111)    miku    kaja-muku     yal=i            jila    baja-nki
           neg     many-pl       3plnom=past      walk dance-purp
           ‘Not many went to dance.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 6.1.8)(9.112)    mama=kiyi kuyu         mama, miku waliji
           bread=imp bring        bread    neg     meat
           ‘Bring some (bread) food over! Not meat!’ (3.9.03.4.DG)(9.113)    miku nanda niya-ngi,                nijanganjinyi
           neg     that      1duIncl-dat       father
           ‘That’s not our father.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)9.5.1.1 Miku=yaji ‘negative existential’
A negative existential predicate construction is formed using miku plus the
clitic =yaji as a nominal predicate. Speakers translate miku=yaji as ‘nothing’. Its
complement is a dative marked nominal or pronoun in such constructions. The
subject is typically unexpressed and interpreted as impersonal, which (9.114) and
(9.115) illustrate. Dative pronouns may indicate the person/number category of
the referent affected by the absence. This is illustrated in (9.115) and (9.116), where
284        Syntaxa negative possession interpretation is also possible. Most examples in the corpus
have a past time interpretation because they tend to occur in reminiscences of the
past. There is no overt tense marking in these examples.(9.114)   miku=yaji      kunyba-nyi wada-nyi
          neg=place      good-dat       food-dat
          ‘There was no good food.’ (1.5.01.1.DG)(9.115)   miku=yaji      ngambala-ngi      mudika-nyi
          neg=place      1plIncl-dat       car-dat
          ‘There were no cars for us / We had no cars.’ (22.8.03.1.TD)(9.116)   miku=yaji     niya-ngi       waliji banda-na wayka
          neg=place     1duIncl-dat meat camp-loc down
          ‘There was no meat for us two down at the camp / We two had no meat
          down at the camp.’ (Belfrage 1991 field notes, my translation)As an independent word, yaji is a noun that means ‘place’ and that takes loca-
tional case marking as other nouns do. Examples (9.117) and (9.118) illustrate this.
Yaji can also refer to general ‘things’ and places, which (9.119) and (9.120) illus-
trate. It seems plausible that the negation of such a general concept as a place/
thing could grammaticalize into a negative existential term as it appears to have
done here (i.e., no place = does not exist in space).(9.117)   kangulkijba       nayi    yaji
          be.dewy           this    place

          place-abl
          ‘And the tide rises fast from that place.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 3.1.14)(9.119)   bayimba      ngay=i             yaji
          buy          1sgnom=past        place
          ‘I bought things.’ (20.6.08.HG)

           ‘And you all keep watching my things.’ (3.9.04.4.DG)In some emphatic contexts, miku=yaji may occur with a the third person singular
nominal nyulu. This is common in clauses that start with the contrastive particle
ngala, which (9.121) illustrates. In these examples, miku=yaji is not in initial posi-
tion because the sentence begins with the contrastive conjunction ngala, which
attracts a second-position pronoun. This ordering pattern relegates miku=yaji to
post-pronominal (post-core) position, which is the usual place for verbal predi-
cates when they are not in canonical-initial position.
     Note that the construction retains an impersonal reading even when there
is a third person singular pronoun, which examples (9.121) and (9.122) illustrate.(9.121)    ngala      nyulu      miku=yaji      maji-nyi

           ‘There were no houses for us.’ (4.5.01.1.TD)9.5.2 QuestionsAlmost all questions in the corpus are information questions. As noted above,
these kinds of utterances must begin with either wanya ‘what/who’, wanjawa
‘where’, or yangka ‘which way’, which are followed by second-position pronouns,
other clitics, and the verb in that order.(9.123)    wanya      ninji     najba juka kukulinya

           where        fut=1plInclnom      walk      next.day

            ‘How should I talk?’ (lit. ‘Which way am I going to talk?’) (20.6.08.DG)Polar questions are mostly expressed with rising intonation, similar to English
question intonation. There is no particular question syntax. The particle kuna
often occurs in second position in polar questions, but is not obligatory.(9.126)     kangku,     na-nyina     kuna ngambala        kuluka              munganawa

            ‘Are you all right?’ (3.9.03.4.DG)9.5.2.1 Non-initial question words
By far the most common use of question words in Garrwa is to ask questions.
It is common among Australian languages for interrogative forms to also have
indefinite, non-question related meanings (e.g., a form meaning who that can
also mean someone, I don’t know who) (Mushin 1995). It seems that, for Garrwa,
this indefinite reading is rare, certainly in main clauses. There are, however, some
examples from the corpus in which a question word appears embedded. It is
unclear whether the so-called embedded use of question words is associated with
an indefinite reading, or whether these are directly represented embedded ques-
tions and the question is simply shifted to the relative time of the main clause.⁹⁵
Example (9.128) illustrates this because the question follows a matrix clause of
direct speech (yanyba ngaki ‘she said to me’), and the deixis in the embedded
clause clearly shifts to the reported speaker (wanjawa nganyi mani ‘where is your
hand?’ rather than ‘where is my hand?’).","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304]"

or contradict as a single word (§9.5.1 for general negation). Overall, the response-
particle uses of miku constitute a small fraction of its overall use as a marker of
negation. In (10.24), it is a negative response to a polar question (marked with
rising intonation but no questioning morphosyntax). In (10.25), it is used as a
disconfirming response to a confirmation check.",[335]

with the formation of yes/no questions (§8.1.2.5), and its use here may be to mark
the questioning nature of the utterance, as least insofar as it projects a yes/no
response. In this example, DG’s use of ngarri kuna does result in a ‘yes’ response
from KS, which is not the case in the ngarri examples given above.","[329, 330]"
"6.3.1 Wanya ‘what/who’This form is used to question both things and people (i.e., potential referents).
Whether the questioned referent is a person or a thing is inferred from the context.
There is some variation between the citation form wanya and the form wanyi in
conversational contexts. Wanya is the most common nominative (unmarked
form). Wanyi- is the stem form used when wanya is case inflected, but it some-
times occurs in nominative contexts (which (6.117) illustrates).(6.117)   wanyi     nanda yingka

144       Demonstratives, directionals, and interrogativesThe fact that wanya itself attracts second-position pronominal clitics is evidence
that the grammar does not treat it as a pronoun. Additionally, wanya inflects like a
nominal and takes ergative rather than accusative marking (as (6.123) illustrates),
as well as other oblique case marking. The allomorphs of the case markers are the
same forms as those attached to demonstratives. Like most Australian languages,
dative marking results in the English translation ‘why?’ (‘what for?’)(6.121)   wanya ninji        najba juka kukulinya

mean ‘who (pl)’ (usually translated as ‘which ones’). This form can itself be case
marked with the regular allomorphs that attach to muku.

wanya by attaching the class 1 stem-forming verb affix -mba (§7.2.1.3) to form
wanyimba.(6.130)     wanyi-mba      barri yalu

associated morphology, not even locative and directional case marking (cf. direc-
tionals in §6.2.1 and §6.2.2 above). It is not clear what differentiates winjawa from
48 Note that, in this example, the plural and locative question word is followed by a third per-
son plural locative pronoun. This may be because the question is asking for a subset of people
from a larger (known) set (i.e., ‘which ones of them?’).

motion verbs. In examples (6.138) and (6.139), yangka clearly refers to direction
because the answers to the question involve directional terms.(6.138)     yangka       ninji      jilajba

49 It is not uncommon in Australian languages to have a dedicated ‘WHERE’ form or ‘WHAT+’
locative case marking (Mushin 1995). It may be that a distinction is made between specific and
non-specific places, but more study is required to accurately determine this.

lated as ‘what manner’ or ‘how’. In these cases, the answers to questions asked
with yangka refer to the manner in which an activity is carried out.","[161, 162, 163, 164, 165]"

marking the boundaries of activities. It is mostly found at the beginning of utter-
ances or in its own intonation unit between utterances.

In conversation, barriwa can be used to signal one activity’s end and another’s
beginning.
     In (10.15), for example, KS is clarifying a location for HG as a particular cave
north of Robinson River. At (10.15c), she utters barriwa before calling out to a
young boy to try to get his attention. This marks a fairly radical shift in the focus
of the conversation.(10.15)   (a)     KS:    jila   narri      langki jila      najba narri(nga),

                         ‘Cave in the north – finished.’                         (0.7)          (d)            juka waydbala

                         hair).’ (3.9.03.4)Similarly, in (10.16), which is from a different conversation recorded in Robin-
son River, KS complains about not being able to get turtle to eat. In (10.16b),
DG responds with what looks like a counter-complaint (she never gets to eat
turtle, either), followed by barriwa. KS immediately changes topic to talk about
an upcoming trip to Borroloola for a cultural festival. The fact that this topic is
immediately taken up by DG reinforces the analysis that barriwa signals that the
speaker has finished with the current topic. The main difference between this
example and (10.15) is that here it is the responding speaker who initiates the
new topic.

tive to demarcate different parts of narrative structure. This often occurs when
a storyteller has been providing some orienting or background information (i.e.,
information that does not advance the narrative timeline), but who moves back
to relating narrative events (which do advance a narrative timeline). Barriwa can
also be used to mark transitions between narrative episodes (both of which might
advance a narrative timeline). Examples (10.17) and (10.18) illustrate barriwa’s
narrative transition functions.(10.17)   wijba     ngay=ili,         munga-na,     wudumbi-ji ngaki

structed quote from a narrative where the quoted characters are leaving to go
hunting. Example (10.20) is an extended leave-taking from a conversation where
a number of young people are leaving the room where this recording was taking

                  ‘Bye, you all!’ (20.6.08)The construction barriwa barri, which combines barriwa ‘finished’ with the ‘pi’
marker barri, is conventionally used to signal the end of speaking activity, such as
a story. It often follows a pause. Barriwa barri was regularly used when speakers
who were recording monologue texts had finished saying what they wanted to
say, which (10.21) illustrates. I translate this use as ‘the end’.

miku ‘neg’, respectively. As (10.22) illustrates, the affirmative marker yu is mostly
uttered with repetition (i.e., yu yu). It rarely occurs as an affirmative response to
most polar questions, but this could be a result of the lack of clear polar questions
overall in the corpus.¹¹⁰ Yu yu does frequently occur as a response to confirma-
tion checks, which may be considered a type of polar question. For example, in
(10.22), which is from an extended narrative, KS reports that the story characters
were left “over there”. DG proffers a candidate place name for where the charac-
ters were left (Kabularrku), and this is affirmed by KS with yu yu.","[330, 331, 332, 333, 334]"

have family resemblances but may not cover exactly the same range of information types. For
example, established information may be variously called “given”, “old” (e.g., Chafe 1976), “ac-
cessible” (Ariel 1990), “thematic” (e.g., Firbas 1992), or “topic” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994). Less-
predictable information may be called “new” (e.g., Chafe 1976), “focus” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994;
É Kiss 1998), “pragmatically marked” (Payne 1992), “newsworthy” (Mithun 1992), “prominent”
(Choi 1999), “rheme” (Firbas 1992), and a range of other terms. See Baker and Mushin (2008)
for more on information packaging in Australian languages.
104 A systematic empirical study of Garrwa prosody is yet to be attempted but would be an
important part of the understanding of Garrwa information packaging.
302         Discourse phenomena(10.3)      ngaki-nyi       mambuka-wanyi, lirrkamba                    ngan=i

            ‘My boss, (he) grew me up.’ (28.3.00.2.DG)In general, information that is less prominent occurs after the core. The second-
position pronoun and its associated clitics mark a boundary between more or
less prominent information. Second-position forms are never prominent in and
of themselves.
     In most cases, the core-initial constituents are also prosodically marked (e.g.,
stressed or in their own intonation unit), and there may be a systematic relation-
ship between the placement of prominent information in an initial slot and its
prosodic marking.
     The interaction between prosody and word order for the signalling of infor-
mation packaging is not simply a matter of stressing an initial-prominent word.
For example, it is not always the case that an initial form is also the most prosodi-
cally prominent, and factors such as the regular pattern of repeating intonation
contours in linked utterances will affect the ways that prosody is used to mark
information. This is seen in the following example, which is from an expository
text on bushtucker (Text 1 in Appendix A).(10.4)      “yangka      ngamba          balba  munganawa”
            which.way 1plInclnom         go     next.day
            Q: ‘Which way are we going tomorrow?’            (6.0)            “kula    ngamba         jila     nganbi-nyi”
            south 1plInclnom        walk     lilyroot-dat
            A: ‘We are going south for lilyroot [nganbi].’            (5.1)            nganbi wudumba=yili            nurr=i,                 darrumala¹⁰⁵,

            bring.back       south-abl     cook-purp
            ‘We’d get lilyroots [nganbi and darrumala], bring it back from the south
            to cook it.’
105 Nganbi, darrumala, and bujuwan are different kinds of edible lilyroots.
                            Information packaging and the marking of prominence             303
In (10.4), the speaker constructs a dialogue (a question/answer sequence), fol-
lowed by the continuation of her exposition. The question asks for the direction
to which the group will travel the next day. As expected, the information that
corresponds to the question’s direct answer is in core-initial position (i.e., kula
‘south’ as an answer to yangka ‘which way’). While kula bears some features of
prosodic prominence (it is relatively high and intense by virtue of being the first
item in the intonation unit), it is the final word nganbi-nyi ‘lilyroot-dat’ that bears
the primary pitch accent for this utterance because it is longer and slightly higher
and louder. While this information was not directly part of the question, it is pro-
viding further new information that is of principle concern to the group – the
purpose of the expedition is not just to go south, but also to collect food such as
nganbi. Indeed, nganbi is repeated as the first word in the next utterance after a
gap of over five seconds, and followed by the clausal core. Here, nganbi is also the
most prosodically marked word, and, although it is no longer new information,
it links the return to exposition back to the information in the constructed quote.
      This one example is given to illustrate how prosody and word order may work
together to facilitate the flow of information in discourse.","[319, 320, 321]"

    In negative-polarity contexts, however, =kiya indicates that the speaker
wishes that the event in question (which did not happen) should happen.(8.119)   miku=kiya         ngayu        jarrba kulkul

          to’). (3.9.03.3.KS)8.1.2.3 =Nyi ‘hortative’
This hortative clitic is not often found in discourse. It is used in contexts where
obligation is attributed to a third party (i.e., ‘someone else, not me or you, should
do X’).(8.122)   baja=nyi        yalu         na-nyina    wayka

232        Clitics and particles8.1.2.4 =Wali ‘evidential’
The clitic =wali, here glossed as ‘evid’, is the only clearly epistemic modal mor-
pheme in Garrwa. It is used in contexts where the speaker infers some future
event on the basis of (usually visual) sensory evidence in the present. As a con-
sequence, =wali expresses that it is possible that something might happen on
the available evidence, but leaves open the possibility that it might not happen.
As there are only a few examples of =wali in the corpus, it is unclear how its
use relates to degrees of certainty. Speakers typically translate =wali-marked
clauses with ‘might’. In most cases, the actual evidence used is not made explicit,
although it can be, which (8.125) and (8.126) illustrate.(8.125)   nayinda    ngalu       badajba=ngka,        wirrba=wali janja

          them)’) (3.9.03.4.DG)(8.128)   kudanyu=wali           yirrba      kamu
          strong=evid            fall        later

          to the toilet.’ (3.9.03.3.KS)

In clauses of negative polarity, =wali attaches to the negative particle miku, which
results in the construction mikuwali. This combination results in its conventional
meaning ‘not able to do X’, which is clearly implied in its literal meaning ‘not
possible for X to happen’.(8.130)    miku=wali        yirrba
           neg=evid         fall

Furby and Furby (1977: 78) describe the morpheme kuna ‘question’ as a particle.
It occurs in second position, a position more associated with clitics than with
particles. It may be that this form is loosely cliticized to the initial constituent. It
always occurs before second-position pronouns when there are pronouns in the
clause. Kuna is used in some yes/no interrogatives to indicate that the utterance
is a question.(8.134)    jilajba    kuna      nyul=i           nanga-ngi-nkurri    banda-rri

of positions than those morphemes defined as clitics. The particles described in
this section have a range of modifying functions. Particles associated with clause
combining are described in §8.3 below. Some particles associated with discourse
organisation are described in §10.2.","[248, 249, 250, 251, 252]"
"9.4.1 Grammatically determined non-canonical ordersThere are some forms that are obligatory in core-initial position: interrogative
words (§6.3), the negative particle miku (see §9.5.1), and the contrastive particle
ngala (§8.3.3). When these forms are used, they occur in the slot that verbs fill in
canonical word order sentences. TAM clitics and pronouns directly follow these
obligatorily initial elements. In such cases, the verb directly follows the core
(post-core position).a) Interrogative sentences(9.67)      wanya     yalu       yabimba

clarative, positive polarity clause with no marked pragmatics. It does not necessarily mean that
such clauses are infrequent in discourse.

            ‘He didn’t give me that axe.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)
92 Note that there is no pronoun in second position and that the demonstrative nayi appears
to occur where one would expect a pronoun to occur. Note that it is followed by the verb, which
is the expected order for interrogative sentences with a pronoun. More work needs to be done
to determine the syntactic status of demonstratives that follow the core-initial position.

          ‘But they came, like this, all the old men, possibly.’ (3.9.03.1.KS)9.4.2 Pragmatically determined non-canonical ordersThere are several identifiable contexts in which words other than those canoni-
cally found in initial position (i.e., verbs and other words that are grammatically
found in core-initial position) occur in initial position. Nouns are by far the most
frequent type of word in this position, followed by temporal adverbs. Some con-
junctions (e.g., baki) may precede them, just as some conjunctions may precede
verbs. In such contexts, the initial word precedes a pronoun, and the verb follows
the pronoun so that the pronoun retains its second-position status. In third
person singular contexts, there is no pronoun and the verb immediately follows
the initial word.
      The contexts in which this latter word order occurs include situations where
the word in question is pragmatically prominent. This prominence usually occurs
because the speaker has some motivation for making such a word stand out
from the rest of the words in the utterance. These include contexts that are often
called “focus” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994; Vallduví and Vilkuna 1998; É Kiss 1998) in
the linguistics literature – information that is at variance with assumed hearer
expectations. Such contexts might include where a word answers a question or
fills a knowledge gap (what Lambrecht (1994) calls “narrow focus”). In storytell-
ing, this initial position is used for newly introduced referents who are significant
for the plot (e.g., because they will become ongoing characters in the story, or
because they refer to plot-changing information – see Mushin (2005a) for more on
the narrative functions of initial position). In both of these contexts, the relevant
information may be new to the discourse (and possibly new to the hearer), but
newness alone is not the determining factor. As Mushin (2005a) demonstrates for
narrative, new information that has no plot significance does not occur initially.

Other common interactive contexts where non-canonical initial elements are
found include when a speaker contrasts with or contradicts something someone
else has said – cases of what I call here managing misalignments. It is also used
for rhetorical emphasis, often with a repetition of the word at the end of the utter-
ance. This of course does not exhaust the possible contexts in which a Garrwa
speaker might use such non-canonical word order. The aim here is to give a sense
of the kinds of contexts where such orders tend to be used.a) Answers to questions(9.77)    DG:     wanya     ninji      wudumba=yi          bayungu

In conversational repair sequences (i.e., dealing with problems of hearing and
understanding, or disagreements about information, information being pre-
sented as the crux of the problem occurs in initial position.
      In (9.83), the participants are discussing the location of a Salvation Army rep-
resentative who has been visiting the community. KS claims to have seen him
arriving because she was at the school before him early that morning. The first
person pronoun ngayu is initial here as KS emphasizes her witnessing of him
coming to the school. DG counters with an assertion that he arrived yesterday
(i.e., not today) and has the word for ‘yesterday’, wulani, in initial position to
contrast KS’s assertion that he was seen today.

                  ‘I just saw him with a swag coming (through the door). I arrived
                  here (before him) in the school.’          DG:     wulani          wanbiya=yi    ngabungabu-rri
                  day.before      arrive=past   sundown-all
                  ‘He arrived at sundown yesterday.’ (20.6.08)d) Rhetorical emphasis
Rhetorical emphasis is a broad term, but is used here to cover other contexts in
which information is presented as outside of the hearer’s (immediate) expecta-
tions. Words in this position can be accompanied by the superlative =mirra and
the intensifier particle mili.(9.84)    wayka-nmirra      ja=ngayu        nayi    daya
          down-intens       fut=1sgnom this         cut
          ‘Deepest down, I’m going to cut (wood for a coolamon).’ (3.9.03.2.KS)In (9.85), the initial position is used in a narrative to contrast how the policemen
were travelling with how the prisoners were travelling.(9.85)    jila=yi        yalu      nukami-na     wujuju bayungu        jila
          walk=past 3plnom foot-loc              all.day west          walk

          3plnom 3plnom         intens     on.top horse-loc
          ‘They (the prisoners) walked on foot all day (until) sunset, they (the
          prisoners) went. They (the policemen) were on horses.’ (3.9.03.1.KS)In (9.86) the speaker has ‘Garrwa’ in initial position to emphasize that she (and
the other old women) are talking their traditional language and not just any lan-
guage while they are being taped.
278         Syntax(9.86)      tapim     nurri-ngka     nayi, Garrwa nurri                 yanyba

            na-nyina
            this-loc
            ‘We’re taping ourselves here. We’re talking Garrwa here.’ (20.6.08.KS)In (9.87), DG is requesting KS to talk louder. As KS has already been speaking, it is
the ‘up’ (i.e., louder) part that she emphasizes.(9.87)      kingkarri=kiyi      yanyba
            up=imp              talk
            ‘Speak up!’ (3.9.03.2.DG)Sometimes, the emphasized word is repeated at the end of the utterance. In
(9.88), the speaker is calling to a relative to bring over some bread/vegetable food
(chips), not meat food. The word for non-meat food, mama, is initial and also
repeated at the end of the intonation unit. Examples (9.89) and (9.90) illustrate
similar constructions.⁹³(9.88)      mama=kiyi      kuyu     mama, kudadi          waliji
            bread=imp      bring    bread    neg          meat
            ‘Bring some bread-food over! Not meat!’ (3.9.03.2.DG)(9.89)      juka     ja=nga              karu nayi         juka
            boy      fut=1sgnom          tell     this     boy
            ‘I’m going to tell about this boy.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)(9.90)      kajala          narri       kuyu,    kajala
            yamstick        2plnom      bring    yamstick
            ‘[I’m going to get my nullanulla] you all bring yamsticks.’ (11.5.01.1.KS)
93 Utterance-final repeated nominals may occur with or without an intonation break. Because
they are repetitions of an established nominal in core-initial position, I am hesitant to label
them as right-dislocations. Right-dislocations tend to be used for disambiguation and are
not repeated in the main clause (although a co-referential pronominal may occur in the main
clause). Furthermore, right-dislocations are always offset by an intonation break.
                                                 Non-canonical word orders      279
e) Left-dislocation
Left-dislocations are identified here as utterance-initial nominal phrases that
occur before a core, where some pronominal reference to the nominal is pre-
served in the core sentence. In most cases, core-initial position will be filled by a
verb, and the second-position pronoun in the core will share person and number
categories with the left-dislocated nominal group. Left-dislocations are harder to
identify in third person singular contexts because third person singular nomina-
tive pronouns are only used in emphatic contexts.
      There is usually an intonation break between the left-dislocated constituent
and the rest of the clause. Third person singular left dislocations are, therefore,
best formally identified by this intonation break. These features separate left-
dislocated constituents from core-initial nominals of the kind seen in examples
(9.88) to (9.90) above.
      Mushin (2005a) identifies systematic functional differences between nomi-
nals in left-dislocated and nominals in core-initial position. Like core-initial nom-
inals, left-dislocated elements may be used for new referents. The main difference
is that left-dislocation is not used in contexts of prominence. In (9.91), the aunt
and older sister go off to hunt at night leaving the narrator and her brother behind.
These two female relatives never return to the narrative. Similarly, in (9.92), which
is the opening utterance of the narrative, the mother is never mentioned again
(i.e., never established as a character). So left-dislocation seems associated with
the newness of referents, but not in contexts of prominence.(9.91)    biliki-yurru, baki maju ngaki,           balba bul=i
          MyZ-dec       and eZ          1sgdat     go       3dunom=past
          munga-na
          night-loc
          ‘Aunty and my older sister, they went at night.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(9.92)    ngadanganja, kuluka=yi
          mother           sleep=past
          ‘Mother, (she) was asleep.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)Left-dislocations may introduce new characters into narrative that are mentioned
again in the story, although I have no examples of left-dislocations being used for
principal characters. In both (9.93) and (9.94), the left-dislocated nominal group
is the first mention of a character, but not the main character of the story.
280         Syntax(9.93)      ngaki-nyi       mambuka-wanyi, lirrkamba                   ngan=i

Preface and acknowledgements
My introduction to Garrwa began in 1999 when I embarked on the Austral-
ian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) funded
“Garrwa Language Project” in conjunction with members of the Borroloola Lan-
guage Centre. In the first phase of the project, I conducted fieldwork in Borroloola
in November 1999 and March-June 2000 to produce a 325-word picture diction-
ary and a non-technical grammatical sketch to facilitate the Garrwa language
program. These materials were published in house to be available for developing
teaching materials. A number of mostly narrative texts were also audio recorded
at this time and compiled as an in-house text collection.
     I was able to continue working on Garrwa in 2001 through a University of
Sydney postdoctroral fellowship entitled “Language loss and the linguistics of
storytelling in Aboriginal Australia”. The focus of this project was on language
use in narrative discourse. I conducted field trips in May 2001 and August-October
2003 that concentrated on the recording and transcription of narrative and con-
versational data with elicitation of particular linguistic features a secondary goal.
Publications that emerged from this narrative-focused project include Mushin
(2005a), Mushin (2005b), Mushin (2006), Simpson & Mushin (2008), and Mushin
& Simpson (2008). More conversational data was collected and transcribed in
field trips in November 2006 and June 2008, which was supported by AIATSIS
“Garrwa Language Project, Phase 2” and a University of Queensland Staff grant.
     In writing this grammar, I have tried to balance the interests of both Garrwa
people and linguists. Garrwa people may want to use this book as a resource for
how to say things in Garrwa or to provide tools for language maintenance and
revitalisazation in the future. They may also like to have a document that dem-
onstrates the uniqueness of their language. Linguists may be interested in the
grammatical features of Garrwa for a range of theoretical issues.
     My own interests have been in developing a description of the language as it
is used by its speakers. Consequently, the focus of this grammar is on the kinds of
utterances that speakers employ in actual discourse, and it takes advantage of the
considerable corpus of Garrwa discourse recorded between 1999 and 2010, which
is supplemented with field notes and recordings of other linguists and anthro-
pologists who have worked on Garrwa. I focus less on structures that, though they
may be elicited under certain conditions, are seldom used. Where possible, I try
to link my description of the structural features of Garrwa to the ways in which
such structures are used in discourse, especially ordinary conversation.
     While many Garrwa speakers have contributed to this project, I have been
fortunate to have had sustained language teaching, transcription, and transla-
tion assistance from †Doreen George, †Kathleen Shadforth, and Thelma Dixon.
viii      Preface and acknowledgementsThese three women, all born and raised in Robinson River, have contributed
the bulk of the discourse and grammatical data used for this description. Other
significant contributors include Eileen and †Don Rory, †Dinny McDinny, Nancy
McDinny, Myra McDinny, Hazel Godfrey, and Miriam Charlie.
     A considerable number of other people have also helped with this project.
I particularly want to thank Rebecca Green who first alerted me to the Garrwa
people’s interest in having a linguist work on their language. I am very grateful
for the ongoing support of the original Borroloola Language Centre and particu-
larly their director Maryanne Riley. Karan Hayward has adminstered the AIATSIS
grant on behalf of Papalu-Apparr Kari Aboriginal Corporation in Tennant Creek.
In Borroloola, I have also had the support of Peter Callinan, co-ordinator of the
Waralungku Arts Centre, and Mike Longton. My trips to Robinson River were
helped by the support of Council co-ordinator Bill South and Helen Webber,
former principal of the Robinson River School. I also am grateful for the intel-
lectual support, advice, and constructive criticism from Brett Baker, Rod Gardner,
Mark Harvey, Mary Laughren, Rachel Nordlinger, Patrick McConvell, Felicity
Meakins, Rob Pensalfini, Jane Simpson, and Robert Van Valin.
     Thanks go to Adam LeBrocq, Ruby Rayner, and Paul Sidwell for editorial
support. The Map was produced by the Cartographic section of Education and
Multimedia Services, Australian National University.
     My family, both near and extended, have been a constant source of love and
support and are a major reason this book has been completed.

Map of Garrwa and surrounding languages.
1 The Garrwa language and its speakers1.1 Garrwa country and contact historyGarrwa language territory extends roughly from the eastern bank of the Macarthur
River at Borroloola in the Northern Territory southeast to just over the Queens-
land Border towards the ex-mission settlement of Doomadgee and the Nichol-
son River. Traditionally, Garrwa country did not include the coastline along the
Gulf of Carpentaria, although Garrwa people today do affiliate with the area at
the mouths of the major rivers that extend south of the Gulf of Carpentaria: the
Wearyan, Folsche, and Robinson rivers. Most maps that show Aboriginal lan-
guage territory have Garrwa extending south as far as the ends of the rivers that
flow from the Gulf of Carpentaria. The surviving surrounding language groups
include Yanyuwa (a coastal group to the north and west), Waanyi (to the south),
Gudanji (also to the south), and Ganggalida (to the east). Two other neighbouring
groups, Binbinka and Wilangarra, had disappeared shortly after European settle-
ment and there are no records of their languages. The approximate boundaries of
these language areas are represented on the map, which is based on the maps in
Harvey (2009).
     Pickering (1992: 11), in his study of traditional Western Garrwa hunting prac-
tices, describes their environment as a “transitional zone between the northern
subhumid to humid tropics and the southern central semi-arid to arid inland…
centre[ing] on the major north-south running river and stream systems of the Gulf
fall, with seasonal excursions into the hills of the Bukalara/Barkly Plateau, and
onto the plains of the Gulf fall”. These major north-south rivers include (from west
to east), the Wearyan, Folsche, Robinson, and Calvert Rivers, as well as Settle-
ment Creek (at Wollogorang). Additionally, there are many freshwater billabongs
(or lagoons) that become expansive lakes in the wet season. Thus, Garrwa culture
developed in an environment that was neither coastal nor arid between the Gulf
of Carpentaria coastline and the vast Barkly Tableland to the south. Towards the
coast, the rivers become esturine and open out into mangrove swamps, while
inland the country becomes stony with sandstone gorges and escarpments. There
are many caves in this area that were used as shelter in the wet season.
     Garrwa people call themselves freshwater people who exploit the bounties of
these river systems and billabongs: freshwater fish, crayfish, turtles, waterfowl,
and waterlilies were staple parts of a diet that also consisted of land mammals
(kangaroo, echidna, and possums), tubers, and fruit. Pickering (1989: 12)
describes Garrwa land use as seasonal but traditionally people moved around in
no more than a radius of about 15 kilometres to take advantage of the food avail-
2       The Garrwa language and its speakersable at different times of the year. The climate is governed by a tropical wet-dry
cycle. The long wet season would result in a dispersal of population because there
were many sources of water and food. As the land dried up over the dry season,
people would cluster around the permanent water supplies of the major rivers.
Trigger (1987b) shows how Garrwa material culture (including manufacture of
spear throwers and stone tools) distinguishes them from their coastal Saltwater
neighbours to the north and east.
    The first Europeans to enter Garrwa country would most likely have been the
exploratory parties headed by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1844 and 1845 that travelled
from the east coast of Australia to approximately where Darwin is today, from
the Great Dividing Range across the Gulf of Carpentariacoastline. While there is
no specific reference to Garrwa people in the journals of this expedition, there is
clear recognition of the presence of a people living in Garrwa country. Roberts
(2005: 9), in his early contact history about the Gulf of Carpentaria region (includ-
ing Garrwa country), relates what Leichhart recorded:    In the vicinity of what is now the Robinson and Wearyan rivers he described emu traps
    around waterholes, fish traps and fishing weirs across rivers, well-used footpaths, major
    living areas with substantial dwellings, wells of clear water and a sophisticated method of
    detoxifying the otherwise extremely poisonous cycad nuts.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

18 It is, of course, possible that the conjugation class forms are the reflexes of an earlier sys-
tem of complex predication.
40        Grammatical overview3.2.3.1 Pronouns
Pronouns (Chapter 5) form a distinct category in Garrwa based on their restricted
syntax and class-specific case morphology. Like nouns, pronouns inflect for core
grammatical relations (nominative and accusative), oblique (dative), and loca-
tional and directional cases. Pronominal categories are like those found in many
other Australian languages: there are forms for first, second, and third person
singular, dual, and plural; first person non-singular pronouns distinguish inclu-
sive and exclusive categories. Additionally, there is no third person singular accu-
sative form and third person singular nominative forms are rarely used. Morphol-
ogy is regular, except for first and second person singular forms, which exhibit
some suppletion.
     A distinctive property of Garrwa pronouns is the formation of compounds,
which include accusative + nominative pronouns (§5.4). These are used for tran-
sitive constructions that only involve human referents. Example (3.10) compares
some pronoun forms.(3.10)     ngayu         ‘first person singular nominative’
           ngana         ‘first person singular accusative’
           ninji         ‘second person singular nominative’
           ninya         ‘second person singular accusative’
           yalu          ‘third person plural nominative’
           yalu-nya      ‘third person plural accusative’
           ninga         ‘second person singular accusative/ first person singular
                         nominative’
           nganinji      ‘first person singular accusative/ second person singular
                         nominative’
           yalunjalu     ‘third person plural accusative/ third person plural nomi-
                         native’Pronouns almost always occur in second position in the clausal core, where
they are often cliticized to the core-initial word. This is illustrated in (3.6). As §3.1
notes, Garrwa is like many languages of north-central Australia (e.g., Warlpiri,
Gurindji, and Wambaya) because it has second-position pronouns. Most of these
languages have an additional set of free pronouns that pattern with nominals
in their distribution. What distinguishes Garrwa in this respect is the lack of a
formal distinction between second-position pronouns and free pronouns. That is,
the same pronominal forms found in second-position clitic complexes may also
occur utterance initially; for example, in cases of prominence (see 3.11, which
is from a conversation), where a third person plural nominative pronoun occurs
initially as the answer to a question.

There are two demonstrative roots: distal nana- and proximal na-. The proximal na-
forms two stems: na-yi- and na-ngi-. These combine with a large range of suffixes.
The unmarked (absolutive) demonstrative form alternates between the stem nana/
nayi and the root or stem + -nda suffix nanda/nayinda. Demonstratives can take
the same range of case marking as nouns and pronouns, albeit with distinctive
case allomorphy. They can function as nominals and are often used as anaphors,
especially because third person singular nominative pronouns are rarely used.(3.12)    nanda          ngudijba=ngka
          that           be.hot=pres
          ‘That one is hot!’ (Hale 1962 field notes)(3.13)    baki    nayi    barri wijkunumba nurr=i
          and     this    dm      bring.back     1plExclnom=past
          ‘And this one we brought back (=sugarbag).’ (1.5.01.2.TD)Demonstrative roots are part of the system of spatial orientation, and combine
with locative and directional case suffixes or with the deictic suffix -ba.(3.14)    jungku     ngali                  nana-nyina
          sit        1duExclnom=past that-loc

          sit        fut=1sgnom that-deic          dm
          ‘I’m going to stay there.’ (8.9.10.TD)More details of Garrwa demonstratives are in §6.1.
42        Grammatical overview3.2.3.3 Directionals
Like many Australian languages, spatial orientation in Garrwa is largely
expressed using an absolute reference system based on the four compass direc-
tions: langki ‘north’, kula ‘south’, bayungu ‘west’, and karri ‘east’, as well as the
vertical axis: kingkarri ‘up’ and wayka ‘down’. These forms combine productively
with a number of morphemes to specify the location, the direction, the distance,
and the relation to landmarks. This range of suffixes is particular to these direc-
tional morphemes, which justifies their classification as an independent closed
class in Garrwa. The morphological properties of directionals are detailed in §6.2.","[57, 58, 59, 60]"
"3.1 Morphosyntactic typologyGarrwa is and has been spoken in a linguistically diverse region of Australia. The
language families with which Garrwa people have had considerable sustained
contact include the non-Pama-Nyungan Mirndi (largely Gudanji and Wambaya)
and Tangkic (Ganggaliida) families, as well as the Pama-Nyungan Waluwarric
(Yanyuwa) family. As noted in Chapter 1, there has been considerable debate
about whether the Garrwan language family (Garrwa and Waanyi) belongs to the
Pama-Nyungan or the Non-Pama-Nyungan language family. Whatever its genetic
and contact history, Garrwa morphology and syntax demonstrate a number of
typologically unusual, as well as typologically regular, features for an Australian
language.
     Like all of its surrounding languages (except Yanyuwa¹⁴), Garrwa is a suf-
fixing-only language. Also like many Australian languages, it is highly agglu-
tinative, with each morpheme clearly following another. While there are some
morphosyntactic processes associated with the combination of morphemes, the
forms of morphemes are transparent in words. We see this in (3.1) – an instru-
mental construction that comprises the noun comitative suffix -yudi and the erga-
tive suffix -nyi; (3.2) – a directional form, the locative suffix -rri, and the locational
suffix -nbana (which means ‘on the side of a landmark feature’ (e.g., a river)); and
14 Yanyuwa itself is somewhat unusual for a Pama-Nyungan language because it has both
prefixes and suffixes.
34         Grammatical overview(3.3) – an ablative pronoun that comprises a pronominal root, the locative suffix
-ndu, and the ablative suffix -nanyi.(3.1)       wabuda-yudi-nyi
            water-with-erg
            ‘with water’ (e.g., sprinkle a fire with water)(3.2)       bayanga-rri-nbana
            west-loc-side2
            ‘on the west side’(3.3)       nganyi-ndu-nanyi
            2sg-loc-abl
            ‘(away) from you’Like most suffixing languages in Australia, Garrwa is largely dependent marking:
regular case-marking is required on nominals, including pronouns and demon-
stratives, to indicate grammatical function. Verbal inflectional morphology is
limited to a set of participial suffixes: there is no verb agreement and no verb-
specific tense/aspect/mood morphology (see §3.3 below).
    Also, like many Australian languages, core grammatical relations (subject and
object) follow a “split ergative” pattern (Dixon 1994), where all nouns (including
proper nouns) and demonstratives follow an ergative/absolutive pattern and all
pronouns follow a nominative/accusative pattern,¹⁵ which (3.4) illustrates.(3.4)       a.      jawunja=yi nganinyi jibarri-wanyi
                    kiss=past    man       woman-erg
                    ‘The woman kissed the man.’            b.      jawunja ngay=i                  nganinyi
                    kiss        1sgnom=past         man
                    ‘I kissed the man.’            c.      jawunja ngan=i        nganinyi-wanyi
                    kiss     1sgacc=past man-erg
                    ‘The man kissed me.’
15 The category absolutive is not overtly coded in the glosses for nominals. Ergative, nomina-
tive, and accusative are all overtly coded in the gloss line.

Other relations are signalled by non-core case-marking with dative, locative, and
directional suffixes.(3.5)       a.      kuyu     ngay=i           mama,          wawarra-nyi

                    bring    1sgnom=past food                  camp-all
                    ‘I brought food to the camp.’Garrwa syntax is built around a second-position clitic complex that minimally
includes a pronoun or a tense, aspect, or modal marker, although it mostly
includes both. The second-position pronoun can only mark the subject (nomina-
tive pronoun), the object (accusative pronoun), or both the subject and the object
(human referents only). This is illustrated in (3.6). Oblique pronominal arguments
never occur in second position.¹⁶(3.6)       a.      kuyu     ngay=i            mama
                    bring    1sgnom=past food
                    ‘I brought food.’ (subject pronoun and tense marking in second
                    position)            b.      kuyu    ngan=i          Mukularrangu-rri
                    bring 1sgacc=past Robinson.River-all
                    ‘He brought me to Robinson River.’ (object pronoun and tense
                    marking in second position)
16 Second-position pronouns are conventionally written as separate words even though they
are usually prosodically dependent on the initial word and are thus better analysed as clitics.
This convention has arisen in part because of speakers’ treatment of pronouns as independ-
ent words, and in part because these pronouns can occur elsewhere in clauses and in contexts
where they are clearly not cliticized (e.g., in utterance-initial position).
36       Grammatical overview          c.      kuyu     ninga           Mukularrangu-rri
                  bring    2sgacc/1sgnom Robinson.River-all
                  ‘I’m bringing you to Robinson River.’ (subject and object in
                  second position)          d.      kuyu=kiyi     Mukularrangu-rri
                  bring=imp Robinson.River-all
                  ‘Bring her to Robinson River!’ (modal marking only in second
                  position)The positioning of basic grammatical information in second position, such as
person, number, and grammatical relations of core arguments, as well as tense,
aspect, and modal information, is an areal feature of north-central Australia
that includes Garrwa and some languages to its south and west (Mushin 2005c;
Mushin 2006). For example, similar structures are found in some Ngumpin-
Yapa (e.g., Warlpiri and Gurindji), Tangkic (e.g., Ganggaliida), and Mirndi (e.g.,
Wambaya) languages. Waanyi pronouns appear to behave similarly to Garrwa,
but Waanyi does not have tense or aspect marking in this position as Garrwa does.
The Garrwa second-position system differs from others in the region because it a)
lacks an auxiliary or catalyst element (cf. Warlpiri and Gurindji), b) lacks a clear
distinction between free and bound pronoun paradigms (cf. all other Australian
languages with second-position clitics), and c) shows variation in the placement
of pronouns and tense, aspect, and modal markers (cf. Warlpiri and Wambaya
where the order is fixed). Further properties of the Garrwa second-position clitics
are discussed in §5.7 (second person pronouns), §8.1 (tense, aspect, and modal
clitics), and §9.3 (syntax).
     As shown in the examples above, the verb is the default word class that occurs
in the initial position that precedes the second-position clitic complex. However,
as discussed in detail in Chapter 9, if there is a motivation for marking a word as
prominent (or focused), then that word is found in immediate initial position and
the verb occurs immediately after the second-position complex. This is illustrated
in (3.7) with a question-and-answer pair from a narrative text. The question word
occurs initially in the question, while the information that answers the question
is also found in initial position.(3.7)     a.      wanya ninji      najba juka kukulinya
                  what    2sgnom see        boy   DaCh(of woman)
                  ‘What are you looking at grandson?’
                                                                        Word classes    37
            b.      nganbi-nyi      ngayu       yadajba kukudi, darrumala-nyi
                    lilyroot-dat 1sgnom wait               MoMo       lilyroot-dat
                    ‘I’m waiting for lilyroots, granny, lilyroots.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)Therefore, Garrwa verbs occur either clause initially and thus host the second-
position clitic, or they occur initially among the linguistic elements that occur
after the second position. These properties have led to the analysis that Garrwa
has a verb-initial basic word order.¹⁷ The word order properties in Garrwa are thus
less free than how many other Australian languages have been described. Some
ordered structures can be attributed to a highly systematic use of word order to
mark particular pragmatic profiles (see §9.4 for more details), while others (e.g.,
the ordering of nominal arguments and adjuncts when following the second posi-
tion) appear more grammatically motivated.
     In the next section, I summarize the key morphosyntactic properties of
Garrwa word classes.","[51, 52, 53, 54, 55]"

          sack
          ‘They two saw him. They two emerged from the sack.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)Of TA clitics, only =yi sometimes attaches to both verb and pronoun. Speakers do
not accept such double marking in elicitation, but there are some clear examples
of this in texts.
208        Clitics and particles(8.9)      kulwa=yi            ngay=i               nani        baba

           ‘I asked grandfather…’ (15.5.01.1.DG)In summary, across a range of contexts and pronoun types, =yi clearly prefers
to attach to second-position pronouns when there is one present. There are,
however, a considerable number of clauses where =yi is attached to the verb even
when there is a pronoun present (as the examples above show). There are also
examples of =yi attached to verbs even when the verb is not in its canonical-initial
position. Mushin (2008) suggests that this is evidence of a shift towards =yi as a
verbal inflection, rather than =yi as part of a second-position clitic complex. In
the question/answer pair in example (8.11), the question word is initial (as it must
be) and followed by the second-position pronoun, which is then followed by the
verb with the =yi clitic attached. In theory, however, the =yi could attach to the
second-position pronoun, similar to many other examples.","[224, 225, 226]"
"102 There are many aspects of Garrwa discourse that I do not include in this grammar, but
which would ideally be relevant to a chapter on discourse-related phenomena. These include a
detailed analysis of the discourse functions of prosody, and the ways in which Garrwa speakers
organize utterances into larger structures, such as conversational sequences. Some work on
Garrwa conversation has been published elsewhere (e.g., Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin
and Gardner 2009, 2011; Gardner 2010).

10.1.1 Prosody and word orderLike most languages, prominence in Garrwa is perhaps most saliently and iconi-
callymarked through prosody. Prominent information tends to be more stressed,
louder, and at the boundaries of intonation units, including in its own intona-
tion unit.¹⁰⁴ Prominence is also signalled by word order. The information pack-
aging properties of word order are described in detail in §9.4. To summarize that
section, information that is an answer to an information question and construed
as contrastive or highly emphatic is found in the initial position of the core of
Garrwa clauses, which (10.1) and (10.2) illustrate.","[318, 319]"

     (extracts)Conversation recorded on video and audio between Doreen George, Kathleen
Shadforth and Hazel Godfrey on 20th June 2008 at the Robinson River school
office. Ilana Mushin was not present for most of the recording time.
     The camera and audio equipment was set up and left running for about
25 minutes, during which time I absented myself. The camera was set up to focus
on the three Garrwa women who were seated around a table. Sections of the
recording where other people enter the office have been edited from this tran-
scription. Thus, the conversation gives a sense of how people talk about ordi-
nary things. This conversation has been selected from the larger corpus of Garrwa
conversations because of the high proportion of Garrwa spoken, relative to Kriol
or English. Even here, however, speakers use code-switching between these lan-
guages.
     The entire conversation was transcribed by myself in collaboration with the
speakers who were recorded and Rod Gardner between 2008 and 2010. The first
line of transcription of this conversation follows the conventions of Conversation

corpus that jala is ever used to signal temporal progression.

          ‘I got to go and talk to that white woman until Friday. Friday I got to go
          south (to Alice Springs) where they will feed me bush tucker.’ (20.6.08.
          KS)In (8.201), which is from a personal narrative, it is not clear whether the jala-
marked clause is modifying Wollogorang (i.e., as a place where the speaker’s
mother had her children), or whether it is modifying the time when her mother
remained at Wollogorang (i.e., a time when she had her children). It is likely that
jala does not specify a temporal or spatial meaning because the two concepts are
connected in these examples.(8.201)   ngadanganja           ngaki,   jibiya Wollogorang,
          mother-anaph          1sgdat   remain Wollogorang

          ‘My mother remained at Wollogorang when/where they had us chil-

          ‘They used to walk from the south, where/when they used to stay in the
          south – mother also for this old woman…’ (28.8.03.1.ER)In (8.201) and (8.202) above, the jala-marked clause modifies a location. In (8.203)
below, the common nominal yawulyu (a type of woman’s song) is modified by the
jala-marked clause.

           in the south place yesterday (I bin explain to her what we bin dancing
           dat way).’ (22.8.03.1.TD)8.3.5 Minji ‘conditional’Unlike all of the clause combining particles examined thus far, minji can occur in
both initial position and immediately following initial position. It always directly
precedes a pronoun if pronouns are present in the clause. When it occurs in
second position, it looks like a modal particle; however, its meaning and occur-
rence in initial position suggest it should be considered a clause-combining par-
ticle like ngala and baki. Clauses beginning with minji usually have their own TA
marking.
     Minji is described here as ‘conditional’ in the sense that a clause marked with
minji signals condition(s) under which some situation denoted in the following
clause obtains – a realis conditional. It can be used in both past and future con-
texts and can usually be translated as something like: ‘When X is the case, Y is
(or will be) the case’. Like baki and jala, the TA marker =yili can attach directly to
minji (resulting in the form minjili). Minji is distinguished from the other clause
combining particles in that it has scope over the first clause in the two-clause
sequence, whereas the other particles connect the second clause with a preced-
ing clause. This difference in scope may account for the different positional prop-
erties of minji compared with the other particles described in this section.
     Only one speaker (KS) used minji with any frequency in her discourse. Other
speakers clearly recognize and accept the form as Garrwa, but do not use it much.(8.204)    wabula          minji     ngayu   jungku,    Winmirri-na,

            this fishing line they used to make, sister.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)There are a couple of examples in the corpus of minji occurring in initial position,
similar to the other clause-combining particles. In these contexts, it seems that
minji has a more temporal meaning (i.e., ‘when X happens, Y will happen’), but
this requires further investigation.(8.208)     minji       ninji     badajba Jinkula-na,      juka-wuya

            (11.5.01.1.KS)
80 I am unsure what the question particle kuna does here in final position.

9 Syntax
This chapter is mostly concerned with the linear ordering of elements in Garrwa
utterances, with some discussion of the basis on which larger constituents may
be defined.⁸¹9.1 Nominal groupsThe term group indicates a set of nominal forms that refer to the same referent
and that share the same grammatical and semantic role. I use the term nominal
groups rather than noun phrases, although the groups in question do exhibit
some phrase-like behaviour. Members of a nominal group may occur in a pro-
sodic unit, but they may also occur across intonation boundaries. While members
of a nominal group frequently occur contiguously (as one might expect of noun
phrases), they may also be discontinuous. The main discourse function of
nominal groups is to identify referents.","[268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273]"
"In this section, I consider whether Garrwa pronouns are bound or free forms, or
somewhere in between. In general, free pronouns have the status of independ-
ent words and are often treated grammatically as a subtype of nominal. Bound
pronouns include affixes that usually attach to verbs and/or clitics, which may be
                                        Are Garrwa pronouns free, bound, or both?              109
positional and which may or may not constitute part of an auxiliary constituent.
The status of Garrwa pronouns compared with pronominal types in other Austral-
ian languages has been discussed in Mushin (2006) and Simpson and Mushin
(2008), and this section expands on the analysis developed in those papers.
Dixon (2002) analyses Garrwa as a language that lacks bound pronouns, but
which has, perhaps, some incipient signs of developing bound pronouns through
the compound pronoun forms. While the compound pronouns do indeed bind
pronouns to each other, this is not the same as bound pronouns as a category of
pronoun that must itself be attached to another word or constituent.
     In a number of Australian languages, bound pronouns are transparently
derived from free forms (e.g., Wambaya (Nordlinger 1998)), which usually
includes a systematic reduction in form. In Garrwa, while there are some clear
contexts in which forms may be reduced, as a class, these reduced forms do not
appear to form a distinct paradigm on distributional grounds. This is evidence
against the analysis of Garrwa pronouns as having a free set and a bound set
(what Mushin and Simpson (2008) call “dual systems”), and I have maintained
the treatment of Garrwa pronouns as a single class. It is for this reason that I
have represented pronouns as independent words in all example sentences, even
when they prosodically and positionally seem to behave more like clitics than
independent words.
     Almost all tokens of core argument pronouns in both elicited and text exam-
ples occur as the second element in what I call the clause’s core (see §9.3.1).³⁸
Second position is the default or unmarked position for Garrwa pronouns. When
they are in second position, pronouns are always non-stressed and may be ana-
lysed as cliticized to the preceding constituent.³⁹ Often, this preceding constitu-
ent is a verb (which (5.109) and (5.110) illustrates), but, as examples (5.111) and
(5.112) illustrate, when verbs do not occur in initial position, such as in interroga-
tive and negative contexts, the pronoun remains in second position. This is evi-
dence that the pronoun is attracted to second position rather than to the class of
verb.(5.109)     wudumba=yi      narri     mani        wulani
            get=past        2plnom money day.before
            ‘You all got money yesterday.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)
38 Analysis of word order in a corpus of over 300 clauses in narrative texts found that over
90% of pronouns occurred in second position.
39 The exact phonetic properties of such cliticization are the subject of future research.

          ‘We didn’t used to eat beef.’ (2.5.01.1.KS)The default second position slot for pronouns can be characterized as the place
where pronouns are found when they are being used to signal the person,
number, or role features of the referent in question when there is no particular
focus on these features. This could be because the referent is well established in
the discourse or in the situational contexts, or because other information in the
clause is being highlighted in some way.
     When the discourse or situational context does motivate the pronoun’s high-
lighting, it occurs in initial position. Initial pronouns only occur in contexts of
emphasis or contrast. In such cases, they are intonationally set off from the rest
of the clause. For example, in (5.113), the initial pronoun yalu occurs prior to the
normally initial conjunction jali. In this part of the conversation, KS contrasts
what she and others were doing (i.e., putting paperbark on a wagon) with what
her cousins (and perhaps others) were doing (i.e., getting bark off the tree).(5.113)   bankijba nurr=i                 naja,        yarrijba       waykinyi-na,
          get.bark 1plExclnom=past paperbark put                      wagon-loc
          ‘We got the paperbark, put it on the wagon.’          yalu     jal=i         bankijba=yi      naja            jamaku-yurru-nyi
          3plnom rel=past get.bark=past paperbark FZD-dec-erg
          ‘They got the bark off the tree, cousin (did).’ (3.9.03.4.KS)In (5.114), which is from a traditional narrative text, the protagonist is a man
chasing a couple (one of whom is his younger brother and one of whom is his
                                           Are Garrwa pronouns free, bound, or both?            111
wife). He has just been told by another man has just told him where the eloping
couple have run to. At this point, the action shifts to the angered dupe as he waits
to kill them. The initial third person singular pronoun nyulu helps to signal the
shift in narrative from the previous episode (which was focused on finding out
where the elopers had escaped to) to this new episode that is centrally focused on
the actions of the protagonist. The use of the intensifier =mili also highlights the
wronged man as the central figure of this narrative episode. In the next clause in
this episode, the third person singular pronoun reverts to second position (here
following the verb), which signals a continuity of focus on the wronged man.(5.114)     nyul=i           mili      jilajba nana-nkurri-wa,
            3sgnom=past      intens walk         that-all-dir
            ngadijba=yi      nangka dere         bula-ngi
            hide=past        3sgrefl             3du-dat
            ‘He came right up to them. He hid himself from them.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)Examples (5.113) and (5.114) illustrate the use of an initial pronoun in a pragmati-
cally marked context. In such contexts, there is no second-position pronoun; one
pronoun is sufficient here. This reinforces the analysis that Garrwa only has one
set of pronouns because languages with free and bound pronouns usually require
a bound pronoun form when a free pronoun is used.
     There are some contexts where an initial pronoun and a second-position
pronoun co-occur in the same clause. These are also in contexts where the initial
pronoun is emphasized. In (5.115), the initial pronoun is prosodically prominent
compared with the second position pronoun. In (5.116), the initial pronoun is in
its own prosodic unit, which supports a left-dislocation analysis.⁴⁰ The prosodic
separation of initial pronouns when there is a second-position pronoun in the
clause is also consistent with the analysis that Garrwa has one set of pronouns.(5.115)     ngayu       wudumba ngayu            wawarra na
            1sgnom get                1sgnom child
            ‘Me, I (finally) got kids.’ (The speaker is contrasting herself with other
            women in a community who had had children earlier) (10.9.03.3.TD)
40 There may well be some systematic differences in the kinds of prominent contexts that
lead to the doubling of pronouns, but this will require more analysis of the contexts for initial
pronouns than I am able to provide here.
112       Pronouns(5.116)    DG:    and wanyi kuyu        nanda yiliburru

                  ‘They did, when they went from the east, from Calvert Hills
                  Station.’ (3.9.03.4)Finally, there is the question of how Garrwa pronouns interact with other sec-
ond-position clitic phenomena, especially tense, aspect, and modality marking
(details of these are given in Chapter 8). A number of these clitics always attach
directly to the word in initial position, and precede what I call second-position
pronouns. The pronoun directly follows this clitic. This is illustrated in (5.117)
with the imperative clitic =kiyi (§8.1.2.1), in (5.118) with the hortative clitic =nyi
(§8.1.2.3), and in (5.119) with the obligation clitic =kiya (§8.1.2.2).(5.117)    yanyba=kiyi ninji         mada ngurujba ngayu              yanybi-kanyi

           ‘I didn’t get to eat turtle.’ (impl. ‘even though I wanted to eat turtle’)
           (20.6.08.KS)Unlike the modal clitics, which are fixed in their position, tense/aspect clitics
vary according to whether they attach to the initial constituent that precedes
the pronoun, or whether they attach to the second-position pronoun. Examples
(5.120) to (5.123), which are from the same text, illustrate these variations with
the past tense clitic =(y)i. In (5.120), the clitic =yi attaches to the second-posi-
tion pronoun; in (5.121), it attaches to the initial verb and precedes the pronoun.
Examples (5.122) and (5.123) provide similar contrasting examples for the habitual
clitic =yili.

          ‘I would see them coming here.’ (10.8.03.3.TD)As these examples show, pronouns, tense/aspect, and modal clitics are associ-
ated with second position in the clause’s core. This feature makes Garrwa clause
structure look somewhat similar to Australian languages that have auxiliaries
– clusters of clitics (not necessarily in second position) that combine informa-
tion about core arguments (i.e., bound pronouns) with tense, aspect, or modal
information. Examples of such languages include Warlpiri (Laughren 2002b),
Wambaya (Nordlinger 1998), and Gurindji (McConvell 1996). I do not analyse
forms in Garrwa second position as forming an auxiliary because of the consider-
able flexibility in the placement of tense/aspect clitics before or after pronouns.
It seems more true to the language to analyse pronouns and tense/aspect, and
modal marking as separate types of second-position phenomena. While second-
position pronouns are prosodically dependent on the preceding constituent, they
may also occur as free forms. The same cannot be said of tense/aspect and modal
marking, which must always be cliticized to the preceding constituent.
6 Demonstratives, directionals,
  and interrogatives
This chapter mostly describes forms whose primary function is to pick out entities
and locations in space: demonstrative, direction, and location words, words used
to ask information questions, and constructions associated with temporal refer-
ence. Many of the forms described in this chapter share some features with nouns
but differ enough in their inflectional possibilities and in their distribution in sen-
tences for them to be classified as a different word class from nouns. Like nouns,
however, demonstratives form part of the system of reference, and can combine
with nouns in nominal groups (see §9.1). Therefore, they share inflectional fea-
tures with nouns. Location and direction words generally function as adjuncts in
clauses to signal aspects of spatial orientation. Their inflectional properties are
restricted to grammatical meanings associated with spatial orientation, and they
pattern quite differently from nouns. Demonstratives, directionals, and inter-
rogatives each form a small closed class based on their distinct morphosyntactic
behaviour. There are also a number of location words and temporal words that
pattern more like particles.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"
"
75 I do not analyse =kiyi as ‘imperative’ as such because it is not an inflectional form. The
fact that second person pronouns can occur with clauses marked with =kiyi suggests that the
directive meaning is conventional, which results in the regular omission of the second person
pronoun unless there is a good reason for using it. This is analogous to the absence of third
person singular pronouns in contexts of continuing reference.

          ‘I’ll dive for lilyroots, while you cook (the food) like this.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)
228        Clitics and particlesSpeakers only appear to use second person pronouns in prominent contexts
where the second person pronoun is being contrasted or emphasized. In such
contexts, the pronoun typically occurs in initial position with the clitic attached.(8.108)   ninji=kiyi        jungku yingamali
          2sgnom=imp        sit       one
          ‘You, only you sit (down).’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 5.3.12)(8.109)   ngala      ninji=kiyi      langa    kunda-na      kingkarri,
          contr      2sgnom=imp hang          tree-loc      up
          nana-ba
          that-deic
          ‘But you can stay up there hanging in the tree…’ (8.5.01.1.KS)(8.110)   ninji=kiyi       balba    yingka-rri      yaji-yurri
          2sgnom=imp       go       another-all     place-all
          ‘You go away to another place.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 5.3.9)In (8.111), the context suggests some degree of prominence because the speaker
contrasts herself with the addressee. This may account for the presence of the
second person pronoun, although here it is not in initial position.(8.111)   yanyba=kiyi       ninji      mada ngurujba         ngayu
          talk=imp          2sgnom also be.tired             1sgnom
          yanybi-kanyi
          talk-irr
          ‘You talk also because I’m too worn out to talk.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)When =kiyi attaches to the question word yangka ‘which way’, it seems to
strengthen the degree of obligation that the speaker is placing on the addressee
(Furby and Furby (1977) calls this an “obligation clause”). There are only a few
examples of this construction in the corpus. Note that this construction can be
found with or without a second person pronoun, which examples (8.112) and
(8.113) illustrate.(8.112)   yangka=kiyi          jilajba kamu
          which.way=imp        walk       later
          ‘(You) should go later today.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 5.4.3)
                                                                    Clitics     229
(8.113)   yangka=kiyi          ninji      jila
          which.way=imp        2sgnom walk
          ‘You should go.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)Very occasionally, speakers use the different clitic =i for marking directives. This
is one of the imperative forms described for Waanyi (Breen 2003), and may be
used more frequently in Eastern Garrwa. It only occurs attached to verbs and
replaces its final vowel.(8.114)   janyb=i         nani        hat badibadi
          throw=imp       like.this hat old.woman
          ‘Throw the hat like this, old woman.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)8.1.2.2 =Kiya ‘obligation’
The obligation clitic =kiya is used in a range of contexts associated with speak-
ers’ stance towards the content of an utterance. This includes content either a)
desired by the speaker but not accomplished by the addressee, or b) intended by
the speaker or referent but understood to be socially proscribed or undesirable.
Unlike the directive clitic =kiyi (described above), =kiya occurs with all person/
number categories and in past and non-past contexts. Unlike =kiyi, it implies
no illocutionary force through directing an addressee to carry out an action, but
rather focuses on the action in question as one that is bound by social relations.
     I use the term obligation for this clitic because this term evokes social rela-
tionships and restrictions, explicit or implied. This is consistent with the clitic’s
deontic modal functions. Because there are a relatively small number of tokens
of this form in the corpus, it is difficult to develop a more detailed account of the
notion of obligation. As such, the nature of the obligation may not be explicit in
the data. It emerges most strongly in second person past-tense contexts where
the implication is that the addressee should have done something but did not.
Examples (8.115) and (8.116) illustrate this.(8.115)   kaya=kiya      ninji        nanga-ngi     jala   kaya
          call=oblig     2sgnom       3sg-dat       rel    call

                    dalalambi-ji
                    take.out-purp
                    ‘(I thought that) he wanted to bring them west (to another
                    school) to take them out.’ (20.6.08)In first person and third person contexts, =kiya expresses unrequited intention
(usually translated as ‘want’). This fits the social obligation meaning associated
with =kiya by expressing a self-motivated action (i.e., the thing desired) that is
not able to be carried out. In (8.117), which is from a traditional narrative, the
speaking character expresses a desire to eat, a euphemism for having sex. The
person he desires is one who is not an appropriate sexual partner, however.⁷⁶(8.117)     nana-ma         ngayu=kiya         jarrba
            that-ident      1sgnom=oblig       eat
            ‘I want to eat that one (said the boy).’ (9.5.01.1.KS)In (8.118), which is from a personal narrative, the referent (an apparition claim-
ing to be the storyteller’s father) intends to lead the storyteller and her younger
brother westwards, but the two children do not yet trust him and are reluctant to
go.(8.118)     waluwijba=kiya      bayungu
            lead=oblig          west
            ‘He wanted to lead (us) westwards.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)It is important to note that, while =kiya in first and third person contexts indi-
cates a degree of disapproval by the speaker, it does not mean that the action is
not consequently performed. Indeed, both the events expressed in (8.117) and
(8.118) actually happen in their respective stories.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"

           notes)It is only in third person singular contexts, where the subject is represented
by a full noun or nominal group, that there may be no pronoun (which (8.181)
illustrates). However, it is not uncommon for the third person singular subject
pronoun nyulu to follow ngala, which (8.182) and (8.183) illustrate. This use is
consistent with the analysis that nyulu is an emphatic pronoun (§5.1)(8.181)    nguwalili      jungku=yi nyulu       Kumunjurr       ngala yakal

tion as the following examples with =kiyi ‘directive’ and =yili ‘habitual’ attest.
These are the only clitics that directly attach to ngala in the corpus; therefore,
it may be that this is the extent to which modal and TA clitics attach directly to
ngala. Note that, in all of these cases, ngala occurs utterance initially, and there is
no pronoun in the ngala-marked clause.

          ‘But that boy would just sit there, looking at her.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)The different contexts in which ngala can be used are summarized below.a) Temporal contexts
Ngala can indicate that one event involving one set of participants occurs at the
same time as another event involving a different set of participants. In these con-
texts it is usually translated as ‘while’. It is often used in narratives to contrast
what two different (sets of) characters are doing at the same narrative time. In
such clauses there is never any tense marking in the ngala-marked clause as it
inherits its temporal reading from the previous clause. Pronouns always occur
directly following ngala in these contexts.(8.187)   yundijba     bul=i          munga-na,      ngala nurru

          ‘Those two kicked that old man, WD, while we were out bush.’
          (9.10.03.1.TD)Ngala can also establish the time that an event or situation occurred relative to
another situation while maintaining the same participant. It is often translated as
‘when’ in these circumstances, although ‘while’ may also be appropriate.(8.190)   buluki     nurr=ili              majirrimba, nana-wa, ngala

          work-irr
          ‘He saw them while he was working for the white man.’ (3.0.03.3.KS)b) Contrastive contexts
Ngala can also indicate that the event in question is in contrast with what has
already been said with no implications of relative temporal organisation. In such
cases, ngala is usually translated as ‘but’. In these cases, it is common for the
ngala-marked clause to maintain the word order of an independent clause. This
is the main formal difference between ngala clauses with a temporal implication
and ngala clauses without a temporal implication. It is perhaps iconic of the inde-
pendence of the connected clauses.
     In (8.192), which is from a narrative, the contrasted clause has verb+pronoun
order. In this example, there is a clear contrast between what the people in the
story did not do with a character’s corpse (i.e., bury it in the ground) and what
they did do with it (i.e., they hung it up in a tree).

           ‘I didn’t hear anything but my grandson was there.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)In (8.194), which is from a conversation, the speakers are discussing the cultural
knowledge of central Australian communities (where kids still speak traditional
language and ceremony life is strong) relative to Robinson River, where kids don’t
speak Garrwa and ceremony life is seen as less strong.(8.194)    ngala      kajurra   barri yalu         baki miku yalu

           ‘But they dance and they don’t mess it up, those old women.’ (20.6.08.
           KS)c) In quotation
Thirdly, ngala can signal deictic shifts between narration and direct speech in
storytelling. In such cases, ngala introduces direct speech without a speech verb
to function like a quotative marker. It is immediately followed by the content of
direct speech. The direct speech itself is signalled by deictic shifts and changes
in voice quality. It is clear in such contexts that ngala is outside of the clause con-
taining represented speech. It is usually de-stressed, and any clauses within this
quote have their canonical structure. For example, the pronoun never directly
follows ngala in such contexts. This quotative function is clearly related to other
contrastive functions because it contrasts what one reported speaker says with
either another reported speaker (in constructed dialogue) or with description of
narrative events.

father answers to the contrary, and the direct speech introduction clause (which
is not speech itself) is marked with ngala. Note that the ngala-marked clause here
takes tense marking (yanyba=yi), perhaps to reinforce the deictic shift from one
speech event in the narrative to another.","[262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"

                  (15.5.01.1.DG)8.3.4 Jala ‘relative’Like ngala, jala relates events and situations in terms of their temporal organiza-
tion. Clauses marked by an initial jala indicate that the event or situation occurred
or is occurring within the same time period as the event or situation denoted in
the first clause (‘X occurred while/when Y occurred’). Unlike ngala, however,
there is no implication of contrast between the events in question. Rather, the
250         Clitics and particlessecond clause is interpreted as relative in time (and sometimes space) to the first
clause.⁷⁹
     Jala shares syntactic properties with both baki and mada in some respects
and ngala in others. Jala is like baki and ngala because they almost exclusively
occur utterance and clause initially. Like baki and mada, but unlike ngala, jala-
marked clauses have their own tense/aspect marking, which is usually directly
marked on the particle (cf. Ngala clauses, which do not have tense/aspect
marking). Like baki, jala can directly take the =yili habitual clitic (which (8.200)
illustrates). Unlike baki, however, there is the distinct past-tense form jali (which
may be jala=yi) that (8.198) and (8.199) illustrate. Like ngala, but unlike baki and
mada, a pronoun usually directly follows jala if there is a pronoun in the clause.
This makes jala look like an initial element in the clausal core (like ngala), but
one that can take its own tense/aspect marking. There are no examples in the
corpus of modal clitics attaching to jala.(8.198)     yinba=yi         nanga-ngi    nayi, jal=i          jungku,
            point=past       3sg-dat      this    rel=past sit

            ‘(You) climbed (that hill) when you two were little girls, in the east.’
            (20.6.08.DG)Some clauses with jala are used to modify a proposition or referent in the previ-
ous clause to say something about the kind of place or time it is. This is similar to
how some relative clauses are used in English. In (8.200), which is from a conver-
sation, the speaker says she will go “south” (i.e., to Alice Springs), a place where
she will be fed bush tucker. The jala-marked clause thus says something more
about the south place.","[267, 268]"

Garrwa question words, only yangka can co-occur with the imperative clitic =kiyi.
Furby and Furby (1977) describe this use as “obligation” rather than imperative.

centre (e.g., expressions that mean ‘earlier’, ‘later’, ‘next day’, ‘day before’, etc).
The deictic centre is typically the now of the speech situation, but it can also be
transposed to another time. The few terms that specify times of day are linked to
sunrise and sunset. Some temporal expressions are particles, while others are
adverbial constructions based on verbal forms. Temporal expressions typically
occur at the peripheries of clauses, mostly final, but sometimes initial. In this
section, I provide brief descriptions of the most frequent temporal expressions
in discourse.","[165, 166]"

70 KS alone of the speakers I record uses nurri as the form for first person plural exclusive.
71 Ganggaliida also has the present tense clitic =ngka (ti), which is only used when there is a
third person singular object (the allomorph =ti is used elsewhere) (Keen 1983: 322)
                                                                               Clitics        215
     The full form =ngka attaches to most verbs, with the allomorph =ka used
when the final syllable of the verb includes a nasal+stop combination (thus pre-
venting two nasal+stop clusters in succession). The allomorph =ya alternates
irregularly with both =ngka and =ka.⁷² Examples (8.36) to (8.40) illustrate the use
of the different allomorphs.(8.36)      wijba=ngka     bayungu-na

            cry=pres       that-ident baby
            ‘That baby is crying.’ (Belfrage 1991 field notes)In earlier work on Garrwa, the reduced =a form was described as attaching to first
person singular pronouns. The form is attested in Hale’s 1962 field notes and in
Furby (1972), but it is only found irregularly in my own data. Furby (1972) analyses
=a as a general pronominal form of =ngka and analagous to the =yi/=i alterna-
tion for past tense. However, it is clear from all examples that this form is only
72 Belfrage (1992) analyses =ya as a separate morpheme from =ngka, although he is unable
to provide a clear description of its meaning separate from meanings associated with =ngka.
While he claims it can be used in past contexts, all examples given are consistent with the use
of =ngka. It appears to be a lenited version of =ka that occurs with nasal+stop combinations. It
is unclear what motivates this allomorphy because it is irregular in the corpus. It may be follow-
ing a similar pattern to =kili/=yili alternation, described below.

Indeed, the reformulation in (8.48) (from kululuka=ngka ‘(they) are sleeping’

          ‘These clouds are coming up – rain might fall.’ (Mushin 2003 field

is just about to happen – an immediate future.(8.58)    dukumba=ka        winyurru      ngadara-wanyi

          ‘It’s dry.’ (8.8.03.2.TD)e) =Ngka may be used to mark generic habitual behaviours. This includes natural
phenomena, which (8.64) and (8.65) illustrate. Speakers also use =ngka when
describing cultural practices. Example (8.66), which is from a text describ-
ing preparations for a ceremony, illustrates this. The speaker is describing how
women make skirts in general, rather than describing an actual skirt being made
at the time of speaking.(8.64)    kabala walajba=ngka wuju wayka-linya           jamba-na

in relation to narrative events. This use points to a form of relative tense marking,
but one where the =ngka-marked event is not actually happening at the time of
utterance.(8.71)    dadijba     nanda, wulani           yalu,      ngaraba=yi

The future marker =ja= is used in various contexts associated with unrealized
events, especially future events for which the speaker has a reasonable degree of
certainty. In second person contexts, it can be used as a directive, an alternative
to the imperative form.(8.73)    karu ja=ngayu               ngaki       nayi   jangkurr

          ‘Well you can go down there to sing for them.’ (20.6.08.KS)Like the past tense =yi, the future clitic is found attached to either verbs or pro-
nouns. Unlike the other TA clitics, there is no change in form according to whether
the clitic attaches to a verb or to a pronoun. The main variation in the use of =ja=
is whether it encliticizes to a prior word as other TA clitics do, or whether it pre-
222          Clitics and particlescedes the word to which it is attached as a proclitic. =Ja= is always an enclitic
when it attaches to a verb, but it may be either an enclitic or a proclitic when
attached to a pronoun, which examples (8.78) to (8.80) illustrate.⁷³a) =Ja always occurs as an enclitic when it is attached to verbs with no pronoun
present.(8.78)      baku dukumba=ja ngadara-wanyi

            ‘(He’s) going to talk later to them all day, westwards.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)b) =Ja may encliticize, especially in elicitation contexts, but also in some texts, to
second-position pronouns. This seems to be the main placement for =ja in Hale’s
(1962) field notes, but is not the preferred placement in my own corpus.(8.81)      baku ngayu=ja            yadajba na-nyina
            later 1sgnom=fut wait                this-loc

73 It is still unclear what motivates the position of =ja= with respect to pronouns.
                                                                           Clitics          223

            ‘What are you two going to return for?’ (8.8.03.2.TD)c) Overall, in the vast majority of cases of both elicited materials and in texts,
=ja= occurs before a second-position pronoun, and, in the vast majority of these
cases, =ja= cliticizes to the pronoun as a proclitic, not to the prior word as an
enclitic. This is the case even when the prior word is a verb, which examples
(8.85) to (9.89) illustrate.(8.85)      ngaraba     ja=ninji,       kunyba       wabuda

ngayu to nga. This is the only context where ngayu is systematically reduced in this way.
224        Clitics and particlesd) Unlike the other three TA clitics, =ja= can occur utterance initially, but it must
be attached to a pronoun in this position. These are cases where the pronoun
occurs initially because it is in a context of prominence. It appears that the future
marker may remain preceding the pronoun in these contexts, even though it
would be grammatical to position the clitic following the pronoun (which exam-
ples (8.81) to (8.84) illustrate). In (8.91), the future marker is the first element of
the speaker’s turn in a conversation. In (8.92) to (8.94), the future marker is the
first element of a new intonation unit.(8.91)     ja=ninyalu               manku video na

          and we’re going to get our clothes.’ (21.8.03.3.TD)8.1.1.5 Durative aspect
A common practice in discourse and especially in narration is to utter a length-
ened vowel (usually /e/) over a constant pitch to represent the passing of time.
This vowel may be held for seconds and this, together with the sustained pitch,
gives the word a singing-like quality. Furby and Furby (1977) analyse this practice,
which is widespread in Australian Aboriginal discourse, as a durative morpheme.
I retain the gloss ‘durative’ for this practice, although it is unclear whether it
should be analysed as a morpheme. At the least, it is a regular means for speakers
to express the passing of time in speech.
     I transcribe this practice as eee when it occurs utterance initially and as ==
(two equals signs) when it directly follows another word. Examples (8.97) and
(8.98) illustrate the use of this.(8.97)    eee,    yanyba=yi    nurru-ngi       kangku     “barriwa

          ‘Grandfather said to us: “We’ve got to keep going eastwards. We’ll
          sleep at Wulnguna tomorrow”.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)

            yundijba     ngay=i==
            cook         1sgnom=past=dur
            ‘I cooked food at the place. I cooked and cooked.’ (8.9.10.TD)8.1.2 Modal cliticsThe set of clitics classified here as modal express something about a speaker’s
evaluation of an utterance. Three of these have a deontic modal meaning associ-
ated with obligation and which are either addressee oriented, speaker oriented,
or group oriented: the directive clitic =kiyi (speaker evaluates utterance as some-
thing the addressee is obliged to do); the obligation clitic =kiya (speaker evalu-
ates utterance as something done or not done with approval or disapproval); and
the hortative clitic =nyi (speaker evaluates utterance as something a third party
should do). The fourth modal clitic =wali is epistemic, and the fifth clitic =kuna
frames an utterance as a polar question.
     Modal clitics attach directly to initial constituents regardless of word class.
If there is a second-position pronoun, the clitic attaches to the initial constituent
prior to the pronoun.","[232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244]"

                  place.name (15.10.03.1)10.2.5 Mili ‘intensifier’This particle/clitic is used in a range of ways, all of which indicate an intensifica-
tion of that which is under its scope. Speakers frequently translate it as ‘more’,
although it does not seem to have the same range of meanings as the English
“more”. For events, it can mean that the event is done repeatedly. Mili is mostly
found in second position and so may be loosely cliticized to the preceding word
as other second-position phenomena are. In the second position, mili appears to
occur after all other possible clitics (TA and pronouns). In (10.30), it occurs after
the TAM clitic =(y)ili; in (10.31), it occurs after both the TA clitic and the following
accusative pronoun; in (10.32) and (10.33), it directly follows the pronoun.(10.30)    bak=ili     mili      jurrulaba  wayka
           and=hab intens dive              down

           ‘He speared at them again.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)Mili is frequently used in contexts of emphasis and contrast. In (10.32) and (10.33)
below, mili occurs following the use of the third person singular pronoun nyulu, a
pronoun which is only used in context of emphasis or contrast (§4.1).(10.32)    nyul=i           mili       jilajba nana-nkurri-wa

           ‘We went south again, we were looking for (him), my dad (in contrast
           with what others were doing).’ (3.9.03.3.KS)In negative contexts, mili emphasizes the negativity, often in contexts of disa-
greement or contradiction. In (10.36), which is from a conversation, the speaker
emphasizes the fact that she can’t dance. Thus, she can’t participate in a cere-
mony that others might participate in.(10.36)    miku ngayi=yi          mili     kajurra, balkijba ngayu
           neg      1sgnom=yi intens       dance     be.bad     1sgnom

           ‘I really can’t dance – my knee has been bad for a long time still.’
           (20.6.08.DG)In (10.37), which is from a conversation, the speaker is disputing a claim made
by another speaker on how people used to eat waterlily seeds. The use of mili
emphasizes the disagreement (translated here with ‘really’). Note that these three
conversational uses of mili in (10.36) and (10.37) illustrate mili in three different
places in the clause. In (10.36), mili immediately follows the pronoun and TAM
clitic. In (10.37), mili occurs (1) straight after the negative particle and before the
322       Discourse phenomenapronoun in second position, and (2) after the verb, which is in a post-core posi-
tion.(10.37)   ngala    miku mili        yali-yanyi,   miku yali-yanyi       jarrba
          contr neg intens 3plnom-neg neg               3plnom-neg eat

          intens like.this old.woman grind 3plnom
          ‘But – no they really didn‘t. They really didn‘t eat it like that, old
          woman. They’d grind it.’ (3.9.03.4.DG)10.3 SummaryThis chapter focuses on word order, particles and their contribution to discourse
organization in Garrwa. Some features of turn management in conversation,
such as overlapping talk and the use of silence, are examined in other work (e.g.,
Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin and Gardner 2009; Mushin and Gardner 2010).
The range of particles examined here show much that is common across Austral-
ian languages and languages in general, but also much that may be unique to
Garrwa. For example, while the prior information particle barri shares features
with a related particle in Yanyuwa, they are clearly not synonymous. As noted in
the introduction to this chapter, any analysis of discourse phenomena is incom-
plete without a proper understanding of the use of prosody. Such as study must
be left for future work, however.

                                         Number marking for human referents      79
4.6.1 -Wuya ‘dual’In (4.150), both the kinship noun kangku ‘FF’ and the qualifying noun minkin
‘skillful (one)’ take dual marking.(4.153)   minkin-wuya     ngaki    kangku-wuya
          skillful-du     1sgdat FF-du
          ‘Two great dancers, my two grandfathers (were).’ (28.8.03.1.ER)The word for ‘child’ is bayayawa. In dual and plural forms, baya functions as
the root morpheme. It is not clear what -yawa means. It does not occur in other
words. Note that, in (4.154), dual marking occurs in the presence of the 3dunom
pronoun bula.(4.154)   baya-wuya nayi kingkarri karrinja bula,                 baya-wu
          child-du      this up             stand      3dunom child-du
          kabula-na
          ghost.gum-loc
          ‘There are two children up here standing at the ghost gum.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)The dual marker appears to be optional in the presence of the numeral kujarra
‘two’. In (4.155), the big referents, which happen to be animals, are marked with
the dual suffix in the presence of the numeral kujarra ‘two’, but, in (4.156), -wuya
is missing despite the presence of the numeral.(4.155)   jikuwarra     ngay=i            najba kujarra walkurra-wuya
          wallaby.sp 1sgnom=past          see     two       big.one-du
          ‘I saw two big wallabies.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 3.1.16)(4.156)   rangimba ngay=i               ngunba      ngajarr-yudi-nyi kujarra
          shoot        1sgnom=past duck             rifle-with-erg      two
          ‘I shot two ducks with (my) rifle.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 3.1.1.1)4.6.2 -Muku ‘plural’In (4.157), both the demonstrative and the qualifier nominal minkin ‘skilful’
are marked with the plural morpheme; however, the plurality of badibadi ‘old
woman’ is signalled by partial reduplication. In (4.158), however, the plurality of
badibadi is signalled with -muku (here, there are no other coreferential nominals
80        Nounsin the noun group). In this example, madamada ‘possum hair skirt’ is not overtly
marked as plural even though the plurality of ‘old women’ implies the plurality
of possum hair skirts. This reinforces the analysis that -muku only marks human
nominals.(4.157)   minkin-muku nana-muku badidibadi
          skilful-pl       that-pl      old.women(redup)
          ‘Great dancers, those old women.’ (28.8.03.1.ER)(4.158)   jungku=yili    yalu      badibadi-muku      madamada-yudi
          sit=hab        3plnom old.woman-pl          possum.skirt-with
          ‘All the old women used to wear possum skirts.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)In (4.159), all human nominal references are marked with the plural morpheme.
Note the inclusion of the 3plnom pronoun yalu (cf. (4.154) above with the 3dunom
pronoun bula) in the following examples.(4.159)   baki kuyu        nurr=i             waw~,
          and     bring    1plExclnom=past
          daru-muku             yalu-nya kula-ni,      wawarra,
          uninitiated.boys-pl 3pl-acc    south-abl child
          balalanyi-muku      nayi-muku
          big-pl              this-pl
          ‘We also brought young boys from the south, child(ren), this big mob.’
          (21.3.00.1.DmcD)When -muku attaches to a possessive pronoun, the meaning is ‘X’s mob’ (i.e., all
the people associated/related to X). Again, this reinforces the analysis of -muku
as a marker of numbers of humans only. Note again that, in (4.161), julaki ‘bird’ is
not signalled as plural even though it is clear the referent is plural from context.(4.160)   ngaki-nmuku=yili     yalu,       jila      nayi,
          1sgdat-pl=hab        3plnom walk           this
          ‘All my mob used to come here.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)
                                                                  Possession    81
(4.161)   wadamba=yili yalu        nanda julaki, ngaki-muku-nyi
          feed=hab        3plnom that     bird   1sgdat-pl-erg
          junu       wawarra-muku-nyi
          perhaps child-pl-erg
          ‘(They) used to feed those chooks, my ones, maybe, the kids.’
          (28.3.00.3.TD)Example (4.162) illustrates the use of -muku with the root baya ‘child’ to mean
‘children’.(4.162)   kuyu     yalu-nya    langki    baya-muku waluwijba
          bring    3pl-acc     north     child-pl      lead
          ‘(He) takes them north, the kids, leading them.’ (singular ‘bayakada /
          bayayawa’ and dual ‘bayawuya’) (3.9.03.3.KS)4.7 PossessionThis section summarizes the ways in which both alienable and inalienable pos-
session is marked in Garrwa.a) Possessors in alienable possessive constructions usually take dative case
marking. This is particularly the case when the possessed is a (more) permanent
fixture, such as one’s own stories, which (4.163) illustrates, or a house, which
(4.164) illustrates. As discussed in §4.2.3, kin relationships are also marked with
dative case.(4.163)   karu ja=ngayu              ngaki        nayi jangkurr
          tell       fut=1sgnom 1sgdat            this  story
          ‘I’ll tell you this my story.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(4.164)   wadara-na    ngama-ngi-nyina
          humpy-loc 1plIncl-dat-loc
          ‘in our humpy’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(4.165)   baki mankumanku=kiyi nanda nganyi, wangarr
          and     think=imp            that      2sgdat ceremony
          ‘And think of that your ceremony.’ (28.8.03.1.TD)
82        Nouns(4.166)   langandaba ja=ngayu            ngaki     diraji
          hang.up         fut=1sgnom 1sgdat        dress
          ‘I’m going to hang up my dress.’ (Mushin 2003 field notes)b) A temporarily possessed item (e.g., money) is marked two ways: with the asso-
ciative -yudi ‘with’, or with the possessor taking locative rather than dative case.
When -yudi is used, the possessor is subject and the possessed is predicate, which
(4.167) and (4.168) illustrate. However, when the locative -na is used, the pos-
sessed is subject while the possessor is predicate, which (4.169) illustrates. It is
not clear what motivates the choice between these two constructions in discourse.(4.167)   makirra-yudi      nanda ngila
          paint-with        that      girl
          ‘That girl has paint.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 5.1.7.16)(4.168)   nayi yalu         badajba=ya, nayi waliji-yudi
          this    3plnom come=pres         this    meat-with
          ‘Here they come – here with a kangaroo.’ (4.5.01.5.KS)(4.169)   kaja      ngaki-ndu dungala
          many 1sg-loc           money
          ‘I’ve got lots of money.’ (lit. ‘Much money is with me’) (Mushin 2000
          field notes)c) Inalienable possession is mostly restricted to body parts. The possessed body
part shares the same case marking as the possessor. In (4.170), the possessor is
a nominative pronoun (intransitive subject of the sentence); in (4.171), the pos-
sessor is marked as an ergative nominal as the transitive subject of the sentence.
Self-propelled movement of a body part requires a reflexive subject, which (4.172)
and (4.173) illustrate.(4.170)   balkijba ngay=a            yami
          be.bad      1sgnom=pres eye
          ‘My eye is no good.’ (translation given as ‘I‘m no good langa eye’)

          show        3pl-refl=past hand 1sgdat
          ‘They waved to me.’ (lit. ‘They showed their hands to me’) (Belfrage

          clap        2sgdat-refl      hand
          ‘Clap your hands.’ (29.6.06.1.KS)
5 Pronouns
Garrwa pronouns fall somewhere between the category of independent words
and bound clitics. There is one set of pronouns, represented in Table 9 below,
with reflexive and reciprocal pronouns derived from this set (§5.5). A subset of
pronouns are able to combine to form compound pronouns (§5.4). Pronouns
share many properties with nouns, which includes grammatical functions such
as core and oblique arguments, the capacity to refer, and anaphoric functions.
Like nouns, pronouns inflect for case to signal the role they play in clauses. Pro-
nouns, however, have distinct case allomorphs from nouns (§5.2) and distinctive
syntactic properties (§5.6 and §5.7).
     In isolation, these forms are phonological words and can occur indepen-
dently (e.g., as one-word answers to questions). However, they are more often
found cliticized to a preceding word (i.e., prosodically dependent). The host
of the pronominal clitic is almost always the initial constituent in the clause.
These restrictions on pronoun placement, together with their loose phonologi-
cal dependency, make Garrwa pronouns resemble both free pronouns and bound
pronouns. Pronoun placement is described in more detail in §5.7. Bound pro-
nouns, in contrast with free pronouns, lack a distinctive paradigm, which makes
Garrwa typologically unusual among Australian languages.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]"
"8.2.1 Ngawamba ‘only, just’This particle restricts what is under its scope to that and only that. Ngawamba
precedes that which it has scope over. It frequently occurs clause or utterance
initially where it may attract TA clitics (which (8.140) illustrates) and second-
position pronouns. It can have scope over a nominal (which (8.141) ilustrates) or
an entire clause (which (8.142) illustrates). It is not clear how such scope relations
are established formally. In (8.141), it is clear from the contexts that the scope of
ngawamba is over the nominal (i.e., only the auntie was taken, not other people)
and not over the whole clause (i.e., *only took the auntie, not did other things),

even though the verb is what immediately follows the particle and the nominal is
in final position in this utterance.(8.140)   ngawamba=yili       nurri          jarrba, munjimunji-nyi           wada

          ‘They used to fight in the olden days with yamsticks, boomerangs,
          fighting sticks, but now only with hands.’ (8.8.03.2.ER)8.2.2 Muningka ‘anyway, for no/some reason’Like ngawamba ‘only’, this particle may occur clause initially and attract second-
position pronouns. It has scope over whole events, and indicates that the event
in question is happening for no particular reason. This has implications that the
event (and its consequences) should not be taken too seriously. Speakers often
translate it as ‘anyway’.(8.143)   muningka       ngay=a             nyindu

or continuously. It is sometimes translated with the English progressive form.
Jabarri is almost always found in initial position where it attracts second-position
clitics, but see below for exceptions. It can occur in conjunction with the past

but before a verb. In these cases, jabarri can be analysed as occurring immedi-
ately after second position. There does not seem to be a clear semantic difference
between initial jabarri and when it is found elsewhere.

238        Clitics and particles8.2.5 Junu ‘perhaps’This particle has an epistemic modal meaning conveying a lack of certainty and
is, therefore, glossed with ‘perhaps’. Speakers frequently translate this as ‘don’t
know’,‘perhaps’, or ‘I think’. Unlike most other particles, junu is found at the end
of utterances or at least at the end of an intonation unit. Adjunct-like or nominal
constituents may follow junu if there is an intonation break.(8.153)   jarrba     yal=i          waliji     junu        nyambal-yudi-nyi
          eat        3plnom=past kangaroo perhaps feather-with-erg
          ‘Perhaps they (those men) with feathers (on) ate kangaroo.’ (Furby and
          Furby 1977: 3.4.9)(8.154)   wanya      nanda yaji        karru-rri     junu,      nuyiburri-nanyi
          what       that      place east-loc        perhaps valley-abl
          ‘What’s that place in the east I think, from the valley?’ (3.9.03.4.HG)(8.155)   julaki     nayi    karri junu
          bird       this    east    perhaps
          ‘I think there are birds here eastwards.’ (3.9.03.4.DG)(8.156)   ngawamba ngay=i                  drawimba=yi        naniku
          only           1sgnom=past       draw=past          goat
          junu         nana-nkurri-wa
          perhaps      that-all-dir
          ‘I can only draw goats, I think, all the way to there.’ (13.10.03.1.TD)However, junu can be used in contexts where the speaker clearly knows the infor-
mation with some certainty. In such cases, junu conveys a sense that the factual-
ity of the information should be treated loosely and may involve more detail than
is being said explicitly. For example, in (8.157) below, the speaker recounts the
things she used to do when she was young and living around the Barkly Table-
lands. Here, the use of junu does not mean that she is not certain that they used to
muster cattle, but rather that mustering cattle was one among a number of things
they used to do.(8.157)   majirrimba    nurr=ili             buluki junu
          muster        1plExclnom=hab cattle          perhaps
          ‘We used to muster cattle (among other stuff).’ (25.8.03.1.ER)

Similarly, in (8.158) below, the speaker is recounting a trip to a woman’s dance
ceremony near Alice Springs. She talks about seeing the campfires of all the
women’s groups who have already arrived, something she had directly experi-
enced. The use of junu is not, then, about lack of certainty in this instance, but
rather about suggesting that there were lots of fires distributed around (and more
information besides).(8.158)    jilajba     nurr=i            baki najba nurr=i
           walk        1plExclnom=past   and    see  1plExclnom=past

           ‘We went and we saw these fires (among other things), for them.’
           (21.8.03.3.TD)8.3 Particles for clause combiningVarious particles have a more specialized function that concerns the combining
of clauses.⁷⁷ The syntactic properties of co-ordination and related types of clause
combining in Garrwa are described in §9.3.2. In §8.3.1 to §8.3.5, I describe the mor-
phological and semantic properties of each particle. Most clause-combining par-
ticles occur clause initially, except minji ‘conditional’, which occurs in second
position. They vary in the extent to which they attract TA clitics and second-posi-
tion pronouns.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"
"4.4.1 Ergative -wanyiThe ergative morpheme is used to signal the A-argument of a transitive construc-
tion. This appears to be the only function of the ergative morpheme.²³ Pronouns
representing transitive subjects are not ergatively marked, but demonstratives
and third person nominals are. Ergative allomorphy is determined by nominal
type. Most common nouns are marked with the -wanyi allomorph.(4.44)      nana-ngini walkurra-nyi       nganinyi-wanyi ngarrkadaba=yi
            that-erg      big-erg         man-erg          spear=past

            ‘That fat man speared the kangaroo.’ (Mushin 2000 field notes)(4.45)      ngaraba-ngka       wabuda      na-ngini       bukubuku-wanyi

            ‘This pigeon is drinking the water.’ (Mushin 2000 field notes)23 There is no evidence of ergative marking in intransitive constructions, nor is there any
evidence of the kinds of patterns of optional ergativity that is described for other Australian
languages (e.g., McGregor 2006; Gaby 2008). Where there is a nominal subject of a transitive
sentence, it is marked with the ergative morpheme.

          ‘He might see you (= your fingerprints), the whitefella.’ (20.6.08.KS)The vast majority of A-arguments in discourse are animate and usually human.
Inanimate A-arguments may also be coded with ergative case. These are fre-
quently weather or climate related terms, which raises questions about the extent
to which such nouns are conceptualized as inanimate in such contexts. Examples
(4.50) to (4.52), in which the inanimate nouns are floodwater moving over other
objects and an airplane in motion (respectively), illustrate this.(4.50)    mali-wanyi        murrumba=yi      ngaki      muwada
          floodwater-erg    sink=past        1sgdat      boat

          ‘The airplane‘s going to bring you food from the west.’ (1.5.01.1.KS)Qualifiers, numerals, possessive (dative) pronouns, and nominals marked with
-yurru ‘deceased’ all take the -nyi allomorph rather than -wanyi. Common nomi-
nals that end in /rrV/ also take the -nyi allomorph (hence walkurra-nyi ‘big-erg’,
not *walkurra-wanyi).

24 While case concordance across coreferential nominals in the same nominal group is highly
consistent in elicited examples, in texts, only the initial nominal occasionally bears the case
suffix. We see this in (4.53), where wulukanja ‘father’ could be wulukanja-wanyi ‘father-ERG’.
Case concordance is discussed further in §9.1.1.

position or as a right-dislocated element following an intonation break. Erga-
tively marked nominals can and do occur initially as well, however, when the
nominal is pragmatically marked. For example, in (4.63), the speaker is speaking
to someone who has just knocked a video camera, shifting it off target. Wanymarri
‘white woman’ is pragmatically marked because it is in implicit contrast with the
person who knocked the camera. That is, the speaker is suggesting or warning the
addressee not to touch the camera anymore as the white woman (whose camera it
is) will come and re-adjust it. In (4.64), which is part of a reported speech passage
in a narrative, yingka-wanyi malbu-wanyi ‘another old man’ is in overt contrast
with the addressee (in the narrative).

            (3.9.03.3.KS)4.4.2 Dative -nyiThe dative morpheme -nyi has the widest range of functions of any case. It is used
in a range of oblique functions: benefactive, possessive, and other kinds of alien-
able associations (see §4.7 for more on possession). It is typically translated using
English prepositions ‘for’ or ‘with’. There are a small number of verbs that take
a dative object. Allomorphy is determined by nominal type. Common nouns take
the -nyi allomorph; pronouns take the -ngi allomorph; and demonstratives, inter-
rogatives and dative-marked possessive pronouns take the -nkanyi allomorph.
The Furbys have the additional allomorph –ngka that attaches to derivational
morphemes. I have no examples of this in the corpus, but provide examples from
Furby and Furby (1977).(4.65)      wajba     ninyalu              ngujbul-anyi wada-nyi²⁵
            give      2sgacc/3plnom        rotten-dat   food-dat

            ‘And I said to him...’ (pronoun -ngi) (15.5.01.1.DG)
25 Note that the verb wajba ‘give’ marks the theme and not the recipient with dative case
marking. It is perhaps more akin in meaning to using furnish as a ditransitive verb (e.g., “I
furnished you with supplies”).

            ‘That man went with many dogs to search for goanna.’ (Furby and
            Furby 1977: 3.6.1)Dative case-marking occurs in a range of relational contexts. Most of these are
typically associated with oblique marking across languages. In Garrwa, dative
case is used in contexts where the nominal is the beneficiary of an event, activity,
or object.(4.71)      ngayu      yundijba mama, wanymarri-nyi,           badibadi-nyi
            1sgnom cook            bread   white.woman-dat old.woman-dat

            ‘We’d bring them (mountain berries) back for our kids.’ (2.5.01.1.KS)
26 This appears to further exemplify the lack of case concordance in discourse. The first
person plural-exclusive pronoun nurru is dative because it is possessive, but it could have a
second dative suffix to mark the pronoun as a member of the beneficiary.

noun(s). In cases where a datively marked pronoun is further marked with dative
as part of a possessed nominal group (e.g., phrases like ‘my mother’s axe’ and ‘my
father’s country’), the pronominal allomorph is -(n)kanyi, as it is for demonstra-
tives and interrogatives. Dative pronouns that end in the suffix -ngi (the regular
pronoun form) are followed by -kanyi rather than –nkanyi. It is possible that this
allomorph is selected to avoid the doubling of nasal consonants (e.g., niya-ng-
kanyi ‘1duIncl-dat-dat’ in (4.77) compared with ngaki-nkanyi ‘1sgdat-dat’ in
(4.78)).(4.75)    waydbala-nyi      waliji

          ‘Where is Rory’s camp?’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 3.1.19)There are also contexts of association where dative is found. Because Garrwa has
the associative suffix -yudi (§4.5.1), it raises the question of where the semantic
boundaries lie. Note that locative case is used in some contexts of association,
too. Example (4.81) demonstrates the close relationship between dative case and
the associative suffix -yudi because the speaker uses both morphemes to indicate
that the two story characters returned with a sugarbag (in their possession).(4.81)    wajili-nyi,             wijba=yi         bula       wada,

          ground.sugarbag-with
          ‘They came back with sugarbag – full of sugarbag.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)Dative case is found following the particle jidi ‘mixed (with)’, which functions to
associate a nominal referent with a habitual possessor.(4.82)    nayinda nganinyi jilajba=ngka jidi              wuni-nyi

66       NounsHowever, most examples of jidi in the corpus are followed by nominative nomi-
nals, which (4.84) illustrates.(4.84)    wankijba       yal=ili         jidi      jibarri,     lukuluku

          ‘They (men) would dance with women – in a circle.’ (28.8.03.1.ER)Dative case marking is also used to mark an oblique argument. There are some
verbs that require dative objects: for example, kujba ‘hunt’, yadajba ‘wait’, and
wadamba ‘feed’, while others may take an oblique argument optionally.(4.85)    kujba=yili  nurru            wada-nyi

the recipient is marked with dative case.(4.88)    wajba     yalu-nya mukunyjana-nyi

always used to mark the addressee. The accusative case can also be used, however.
The following examples come from the same narrative text and refers to the same
reported speaker and addressee, but the addressee is marked with dative case in
(4.94) and accusative case in (4.95).(4.94)    yanyba=yi nurru-ngi           kangku

poral location, position, and alienable possession. Some types of instruments are
also marked with locative case. The form of this morpheme is -na that follows
vowel-final nominal roots, and -ina that follows consonant-final nominal roots.
The allomorph -nyina follows demonstratives (including possessive pronouns)
and borrowed words from English. The allomorph -ndu (variant -nbu) follows pro-
nouns. Examples (4.99) to (4.101) illustrate the use of these different allomorphs
(pronominal allomorphs are discussed further in §5.2).(4.99)    ngakuya diba      yal=ili         bindaba Lurrunda      wabuda-na

ogy with place names. Examples (4.107) and (4.108) illustrate the use of place
names in locative contexts with no locative marking, while examples (4.109) and
(4.110) illustrate the use of place names with locative morphology.(4.107)   kuluka     nurr=i                  Jalajarra

particles do not themselves take locative case marking.(4.111)   muningka nurr=i                jungku=yi   kala,      wadara-na

instruments).(4.114)   kudiya-wanyi    yalunjal=ili           rangimba, nanda

tionships in real space are not being marked. These include temporal contexts
(which (4.122) illustrates), but also contexts where associations involve abstract
or non-visible entities (which (4.123) illustrates).(4.122)     daba nurr=i                   nyinbu       kamba-na

take the -rri allomorph following the locative stem (see §5.2). Demonstratives
(including possessive pronouns) take a –nkurri allomorph. Examples (4.125) and
(4.126) illustrate the variation between -yurri and -rri by the same speaker during
the same storytelling event.(4.125)   mada              wijkunumba=yili nurru          wuju,

"7.5.1 -Ji ‘purpose’Complex clauses marked with –ji ‘purp’ mean ‘do X in order to do Y’. In intransi-
tive clauses, the subject of the subordinate clause must be co-referent with the
subject of the main clause, and is only mentioned in the main clause. In transitive
clauses, the object may also be co-referential.(7.129)    kuyu     ja=ngayu         narri-nya bayanga-rri yingki-ji

192        Verbs7.5.2 -Jiwa ‘subsequent’Like the purposive construction, subordinate clauses marked with -jiwa ‘subse-
quent’ must share a co-referential subject with the main clause, and they must
denote an event that takes place subsequent to the event in the main clause (‘X
until Y happens’). That is, the event denoted in the subordinate clause marks a
subsequent or concluding action that was brought about by the event denoted in
the main clause. For example, in (7.134), the eating of food is a subsequent action
predicated on the subject first getting up. Similarly, in (7.135), the cooking of the
goanna is framed as the subsequent action which is dependent on the killing
of the goanna in the first instance. In (7.136), the projected recording session is
framed as a subsequent event to the linguist’s return (she was absent at the time
this was uttered).(7.134)   kuluka=ngka walajba=ngka          ja-jiwa    wada

          walk=past up             alive  lie.down-subs 3pl-loc
          ‘He walked up alive and camped with them.’ (3.9.03.3.KS)(7.138)   ngala      ninji=kiyi      langa kunda-na kingkarri nana-ba

          ‘And you can stay up there hanging in the tree until you are dead.’
          (8.5.01.1.KS)In all of these examples, -jiwa is used in a context where event X is clearly pre-
sented as a precursor or prerequisite to event Y (‘X until Y’). Analysing -jiwa as a
                                               Verb inflectional morphology       193
signal of the endpoint of a sequence of events is, however, also compatible with
a purposive reading. As an endpoint, the second event can be read as the inten-
tional consequence of performing the first event (‘do X in order to Y’). This is the
meaning attributed to -jiwa in Furby and Furby (1977). The suffix -jiwa differs from
-ji in that it does not require the agent of the events to have a conscious intention
(‘Y as a consequence of X’, ‘X leading up to Y’). The following examples appear to
incorporate a (weak) purposive meaning, which indicates the close relationship
between -ji and -jiwa.(7.139)   baki     burrijba ngali            karurri-ji  barri, wudumbi-jiwa

          bring=hab       3plnom up-abl                 cook-subs
          ‘They used to bring the milk from up (there) and/to boil it.’ (28.3.00.1.KS)Forms that focus on events as endpoints may additionally be analysed as resul-
tative constructions (‘Y as a result of X’). Results are usually expressed as end
states, however. It is not clear from my current data whether the –jiwa marked
clause is viewed as a result.
     Another difference between the purposive -ji and the subsequent -jiwa is the
ability for subordinate clauses with -jiwa to occur following the co-ordinating
conjunction baki ‘and’ (described in §9.6.1). The use of baki, which is the regular
conjoiner of temporally ordered clauses, raises the possibility that speakers do
not always treat -jiwa clauses as subordinate. It is not possible for clauses marked
with the other verb inflections to occur with conjunctions. -Jiwa may be special
because it has temporal ordering as part of its core meaning, and this is what may
be motivating its co-occurrence with baki.(7.141)   kakalijba      yal=i            nanda baki yalu

subject as the main clause. It is commonly used to form complements to verbs of
communication and cognition. It is also used in the formation of negative verbs.
When the main verb is a verb of speaking or cognition, the subordinate clause
represents the action being thought or spoken (e.g., ‘I told her to X’, ‘I thought
about X’) rather than the content of speech/thought as in indirect speech repre-
sentation. The suffix -kanyi is glossed with irrealis because it always occurs in
contexts where the proposition of the subordinate clause is not realised, which is
usually because the proposition in question is a thought, desire, or words of the
subject of the main clause, and not a representation of the actualisation of the
proposition.(7.144)    mankumanku       ngaka        wadambi-kanyi

-Kanyi is also used for complements of verbs of feeling and desire, which (7.148) to
(7.150) illustrate .(7.148)    karijba         ngayu       jila-kanyi

           ‘Those two used to bury them, in case we wanted to eat it.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)A third context for the use of -kanyi seems close to the purposive meaning
described for -ji (§7.5.1 above). All examples from Furby and Furby (1977) have
-kanyi occurring in contexts where the purposive clause denotes something done
habitually, or when attention is being drawn to the general utility of the object in
the main clause. It does not denote any particular instance of the event in ques-
tion. In this sense, the subordinate clause appears to function as a modifier of the
object of the main clause. Examples (7.151) to (7.155) come from Furby and Furby
(1977), but I have re-translated the examples to better reflect the use of the irrealis
suffix to signal certain kinds of habitual behaviours.(7.151)    karu       nurru           nanda madajangu nurru

ous actions, ones where the activity described in the switch-reference marked
clause must coincide in time with the event / activity in the main clause. Exam-
ples (7.156) to (7.159) illustrate this. In this sense, switch-reference marked clauses
are aspectually activities.
    The suffix -jina marks co-reference between the subject of the main clause
and the subject of the subordinate clause (i.e., subject control), while -kurri marks
co-reference between the object of the main clause and the subject of the subor-
dinate clause (i.e., object control).(7.156)    bak=ili       yalu      waradijba    wawarra        ngara-jina

           KS)While there are clear temporal framing restrictions for the acceptability of switch
reference coding, there do not seem to be any general valency restrictions with
respect to switch reference marking. These clauses can be transitive or intran-
sitive. Note that the subject of the transitive subordinate clause takes its case
marking from its role in the main clause. That is, it does not have the expected
ergative marking but rather absolutive marking as the object of the main clause.a) Intransitive main clause, transitive switch reference clause(7.160)    jibarri      yakirrimba      nangka  da-jina

           ‘I hear (them) singing at his camp in the north.’ (Furby and Furby 1977:
           6.2.1.5)Although they can occur in descriptions of manner of speech, which (7.164) and
(7.165) illustrate, switch reference contexts does not seem to be compatible with
reported speech contexts. That is, the content of speech does not count as a
simultaneous action. This is interesting because the content of perception does
count as a simultaneous action for the purposes of switch reference marking. One
explanation is that speech representation (whether direct or indirect) involves a
shift in perspective from the framing clause of speech to the content of speech.
Perception sentences do not involve a shift in perspective.
     Note also that switch reference is not used when the content of speech
expresses some embedded illocutionary force, such as a command (-kanyi is used
in these contexts).(7.164)    kaya       nyul=i          nimbala-nya ngabaya-wanyi

The following examples from Belfrage’s (1991) field notes illustrate the incom-
patibility of switch reference markers with representing the content of reported
speech. In (7.166), the irrealis -kanyi is used, while in (7.167), the content of speech
is represented as direct speech with a deictic shift to future tense in the second
clause.(7.166)    a.       yilikajba     ngay=i            nyulu      jilaj-kanyi

verb is still going or continuing. Because this morpheme seems exclusive to verbs
(there is another homophonous morpheme -wa that attaches to directionals and
demonstratives to reinforce directionality – see §6.1.3.2) and not associated with
a position, I do not analyse this as a tense/aspect clitic. Semantically, it has more
in common with other aspectual clitics.

7.6.2 -Warr ‘characteristic’The characteristic suffix -warr derives a noun from a verb that means ‘thing/
person that is characterized by [Verb]’. Some uses of verb-warr seem convention-
alized as in ngarrkadaba-warr ‘spear-char’ for the health clinic (=place where
one gets injections) or kijijba-warr ‘tie.up-char’ for policeman, while others seem
productively constructed for a particular context. Verb+-warr constructions are
often found as modifiers of other nominals. For verb+warr constructions derived
from transitive verbs, the object of the transitive verb may be expressed with
dative case marking, which (7.179) and (7.180) illustrate.(7.174)   ngala      nyul=i           nayi wayka ngarrkadaba-warr

predicates and yet have surface forms that look like verbs, in particular the -mba
stem ending. These adverbs never occur as the sole predicate in clauses and
cannot take verb inflectional morphology. They do not occur clause initially in
unmarked contexts. In fact, they mostly occur either in their own intonation unit
or utterance finally. Meanings are quantificational or spatio-temporal, and often
aspectually modifying the main predicate.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"
"6.2.1 Compass directionalsThe citation forms for compass directions are: langki ‘north’, kula ‘south’, bayungu
‘west’, and karri ‘east’. They can take a range of suffixes that further specifies the
type of directional relationship. These are summarized in Table 15.
      The citation form for all four compass directionals has an underlying allative
meaning (i.e., ‘move in an X direction’). Three of the four (langki ‘north’, bayungu
‘west’, and karri ‘east’) have alternative root forms for locative case (in the case of
langki, bayungu, and karri), and ablative case (in the case of langki). Two of these
locative root forms, langku and karru, may be used to describe location without
-rri. The fourth compass directional, kula ‘south’, does not have a variant root

form, but has different locative and ablative case allomorphs (-rra and -ni, respec-
tively, not -rri and -na).
     These four cardinal compass directions can be combined to point to direc-
tions in between the cardinal directions. The ordering of compass directions does
not seem to matter (c.f. equivalent English compounds where the north/south
axis is first in the compound). The first in the sequence take the -ya suffix: kula-ya
karri or karri-ya kula ‘southeast’, bayin-ya kula or kulaya bayungu ‘southwest’,
langkiya bayungu or bayin-ya langki ‘northwest’, and langkiya karri or karriya
langki ‘northeast’. The same directions can be expressed with burrandi ‘middle’
(e.g,. burrandi langki ‘middle north (northwest)’ and burrandi karri ‘middle east
(northeast)).
     There are three directional stem forms. The citation form is also used alla-
tively (i.e., motion towards that direction). There is also a locative stem formed
with the suffix -rri that is used to indicate a place located in a particular direction.
The ablative stem, formed with the suffix -na, is used to indicate motion away
from a direction.
     Examples (6.64) to (6.69) illustrate the different stem forms with bayungu
‘west’. The citation directional examples (6.64) and (6.65) illustrate the under-
lying allative meaning. Examples (6.66) and (6.67) illustrate the locative form,
which indicates a fixed location in that particular direction. Examples (6.68) and
(6.69) illustrate the ablative form, which indicates motion away from the nomi-
nated direction.

discourse. The locative form kula-rra is used to point to a particular place south
of Robinson River (the location of the recording session) – in this case Alice
Springs – where the speaker had slept with a hat on because it was cold. The alla-
tive form kula is used with the motion verb to indicate the direction in which the
addressee had moved.(6.70)    kuluka ngay=i                 jidi    munjimunji kula-rra

As is common in many Australian languages, absolute directionals are used not
only to locate referents across larger distances, but also to locate referents in a
small or narrow spatial environment (e.g., within a room or within close proxim-
ity to speakers). In the narrative example (6.71), directionals are used to indicate
the direction that the protagonists are moving between as they dodge an enemy
who is trying to spear them. Example (6.72) was said as the interlocutors were
watching two boys playing in the part of the schoolyard to their south.(6.71)    ngarrkadaba=yi       wuni-na,  bulbulngijba bula

          ‘South, they are playing in the south.’ (20.6.08.DG)For even smaller locational contexts, such as when an object or person is being
located next to another object or person, the suffix -ya ‘side1’ is used. It attaches
directly to the root.(6.73)    jal=ili     yalu       jungku kula-ya          ngadanganja

          ‘That dog is sleeping on the south side of me.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)The locative stem can take a suffix -nyi ‘turn’ to specify that the referent is
turning to face a direction as they are moving.

            ‘He walked turning west along the river.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)The locative stem can also occur with the suffix -bana ‘side2’. Since -bana begins
with a stop consonant, the stem augment -n- also occurs, which results in the form
-nbana. While both -ya and -nbana are glossed as ‘side’, they differ in whether the
side in question is on a human scale (i.e., in relation to people or objects around
people) or whether it is on a geographic scale. For relation on a human scale, -ya
is used, while -nbana is used for a geographic scale. Conventionally, -nbana is
used to point to a bank of a river (e.g., the east/west bank of a river running north/
south, or a north/south bank of a river running east/west).(6.77)      nana-ba     gen    makaba=yi yalu,           bayanga-rri-nbana,

used to describe the direction that wind is coming from. All of these examples
have the present tense clitic to indicate that wind is blowing at the time of utter-
ance. Example (6.84) illustrates that this verb form cannot be used with anything
other than wind. A motion verb plus the ablative directional must be used, which
(6.85) illustrates.(6.83)    a.      bayungu-na-mba=ka         yunkurr

          ‘They are coming from the north.’6.2.2 Kingkarri ‘up’ and wayka ‘down’The four compass directionals and their inflected forms are predominantly used
to specify spatial relationships on the horizontal axis. The other two absolute
directional words, kingkarri ‘up’ and wayka ‘down’, specify relationships on the
vertical axis. Both kingkarri and wayka are used not only for true verticality (e.g.,
skywards and groundwards), but also for indicating direction towards and away
from lower land masses (e.g., wayka indicates ‘towards a riverbank’ and kingkarri
indicates ‘away from the river’ ). These forms are mostly used to express direction
with geographic terrain sloping up (e.g., away from watercourses and up hills) or
sloping down (towards or at a watercourse and down hills).(6.86)    daba bula-ngk=i          wayka nana-ba, badibadi,

Wayka can also be used in contexts where the referent is underground or under-
water. Note that wayka refers to the downward trajectory and not to the resulting
location, which is what kala ‘under’ refers to (see §6.2.3 below).(6.88)    makaba=yili yalu        wayka      marada-na

          ‘And she would dive under the water again, that old woman, throwing
          (them) up (onto the bank).’ (9.5.01.1.KS)Wayka and kingkarri can also be used for motion along a vertical axis, such as
climbing a tree.(6.90)    bawa-nganja nanga-ngi, kirrijba=yi           kingkarri nani

          this down (at the base of the tree). He looked up(wards).’ (8.5.01.1.KS)These forms can also be used to describe the direction a form is facing (upside-up
or upside-down)(6.91)    baki kulkul=yili     yalu        larrkimba,                kingkarri

          ngalurr
          chest
          ‘And they used to cook turtle bellyside (turned) up.’ (2.5.01.1.KS)There also seem to be conventional uses of wayka and kingkarri associated with
places. In (6.92), the speakers in Robinson River use wayka to refer to where Bor-
roloola is located. This appears similar to the ways English speakers use up and
down to refer to places (e.g., down to Melbourne, up to Darwin, etc). In English,
there is typically an association with compass direction (north places are up and
south places are down). However, this may not be the case in Garrwa. In (6.92), for
138         Demonstratives, directionals, and interrogativesexample, it is unclear why Borroloola should be down from where the speakers
are located (at Robinson River).(6.92)      wandimba ninyalu              wayka Borroloola
            want        2sgacc/3plnom down
            ‘They want you down at Borroloola.’ (20.6.08.KS)Like compass directionals, the base forms kingkarri and wayka are inherently
allative; they indicate either upwards or downwards motion. When this motion
includes a specific endpoint (i.e., to an up place / to a down place), these terms
may also take directional suffixes, such as the ablative -(li)nya (i.e., motion away
from a goal) and the allative -(li)ji⁴⁶ (i.e., motion towards a goal).(6.93)      balba nurr=ili         kingkarri-ji mundumunduka

            Furby 1977: 5.1.2.17)(6.95)      badidibadi         wayka-linya kuyu nana-nkurri,

            (8.9.10.1.TD)
46 The allomorphy might be related to the number of syllables in the host (e.g., the two-sylla-
ble wayka has the longer allomorph), but it is hard to generalize with so few examples of this
phenomenon.

           (3.9.03.4.KS)This additional directional morphology is only used when the directional word
is the only such word in the utterance. In (6.98) and (6.99), direction is explicitly
signalled by the allative-marked nominals; kingkarri and wayka remain in their
root form.(6.98)     wijba    yal=i           kingkarri dat         school-yurri

           ‘He fell from up there and hit down on the ground.’ (7.8.03.1.TD)6.2.3 Location adverbialsIn addition to the absolute directionals described in the above two sections,
Garrwa also has a closed set of (mostly) uninflected adverbials that are used to
locate objects relative to each other along different axes: yundu ‘top’, kala ‘under’,
walu ‘in front’, banykani ‘behind’, and kalawunyi ‘inside’. I also include juju ‘a
long way away’ and bangani ‘close’ in this category because they share morpho-
140        Demonstratives, directionals, and interrogativessyntactic features with the other forms, although these refer to distance in rela-
tion to the deictic centre rather than the locational axis.
     Like other adjuncts, location adverbials tend to occur at the ends of utter-
ances. They may co-occur with other locational words and phrases as in (6.101),
where yundu co-occurs with a locative case-marked nominal to indicate the
precise spatial relationship between the subject and the locative nominal as ‘on
top (of the horse)’, and (6.102), where banykani co-occurs with a locative nominal
to indicate that the subject is ‘behind the anthill’). In (6.103), kala and yundu con-
ventionally refer to two east-going roads from Robinson River to the Queensland
border.(6.101)    kirrijba=yi    yarrama-na jungku=yi yundu

            (3.9.03.4.KS)The suffix -nbana ‘side2’ can occur with yundu ‘top’, which makes it the only
suffix that is found across both directional and locational words. It is used to
focus on the relative positioning of one object with respect to a landscape feature,
such as a hill or a river. For yundu ‘top’, an additional syllable -wi- is inserted
between the locational word and the suffix, possibly to avoid two nasal+stop
clusters in adjacent syllables across morpheme boundaries (i.e., yundu-wi-nbana
rather than *yundu-nbana).⁴⁷(6.114)     ngala      nyulu-ma      barri malba=yi

47 An alternative analysis suggests that the -wi- augment occurs because yundu is a disyllabic
root. Note that the trisyllabic kingkarri does not have an extra stem-forming augment with
-nbana.

6.3 Interrogative wordsThere are three root forms for asking information questions: wanya ‘what/who’,
winjawa ‘where’, and yangka ‘which way’. These always occur clause initially and
attract second-position clitics, including pronouns. While they share functional
and syntactic properties, only wanya takes case marking, which is consistent
with its function as a marker of unknown nominals. The other two forms take no
extra morphology.","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"
"10.1.2 The ‘prior information’ particle barriThe particle barri, here glossed as ‘pi’ or ‘prior information’, is a discourse-fre-
quent form whose meaning is clearly associated with the organization of dis-
course rather than the propositional content of utterances.¹⁰⁶ Generally, barri has
scope over the information that precedes it (usually the word that precedes it),
and operates in conjunction with word order and prosody to signal the status
of information being expressed. While the precise pragmatic properties of barri
have yet to be completely solved, its principle function appears to be to link infor-
mation under its scope with prior information. Such prior information may be
mentioned earlier in the same discourse, or may constitute shared information
with the interlocutor. Barri frequently occurs following the distal demonstrative
nanda, which supports its analysis as a type of anaphoric discourse marker. For
106 Barri was originally analysed as a hesitation marker (e.g., like English um) in Furby and
Furby (1977) and Belfrage (1992), perhaps due to its seemingly flexible distribution within
clauses. However, it has no properties of true hesitation markers. Kirton and Charlie (1996)
analyse the similar Yanyuwa particle barra as a focus particle.
304         Discourse phenomenathis reason, I do not analyse barri as a focus marker as Kirton and Charlie (1996)
do for the related Yanyuwa particle barra.¹⁰⁷
     Barri is, therefore, a resource that speakers may use to point to the connect-
edness of information. Its use may draw attention to the information under its
scope, but its primary function is not to mark information as new, contrastive,
or emphatic. It frequently occurs when repeating, reformulating, or elaborating
on information already mentioned in prior talk. It is never used to introduce new
topical referents. Barri occurs more frequently in explanations, accounts, story-
telling, and answers, which are all speech activities for which making connec-
tions to prior information is highly relevant. Example (10.5) illustrates a typical
use of barri in a storytelling context.","[321, 322]"

rect speech/thought/perception sentences but was given direct representation.

are no clear deictic cues in the embedded clause. The future marker in (9.130)
might suggest a future relative to the past time in the main clause (future in the
past). This would apply whether the embedded question is a more direct repre-
sentation of the pilot questioning what he might see (‘…where will he see that
body?’), or whether it is truly an indirect report of what the pilot said (‘…where he
will/might see that body.’).(9.129)     waluku        nganarri          karu winjawa nani             yilarr

telling another character (who has been arrested) to give an account of a fight for
which he has been arrested. The use of past tense in the embedded clause sup-
ports an analysis here of a truly embedded clause whose deictic configuration is
relative to that in the main clause. The embedded clause has the structure of a
question, but it is difficult to see how this could be interpreted as a direct ques-
tion (? ‘You should tell that white man how did you fight each other?’).","[304, 305]"
"3.2.4 Particles and cliticsGarrwa particles are identified as forms that do not take any additional suffixes,
inflectional or otherwise. Forms of this type exhibit a range of grammatical func-
tions that includes adverbial-like clausal modification (§8.2), location (§6.2.3),
clause combining (§8.3), negation (§9.5.1), and a range of functions associated
with discourse organization and talk-in-interaction (Chapter 10). Some particles
typically occur utterance initially (e.g., baki ‘and’ (§8.3.1)), some typically utter-
ance finally (e.g., junu ‘perhaps’ (§8.2.5)), while others occur in second position
(e.g., kuna ‘question’ (§8.1.2.5)). Particles that occur in utterance-medial posi-
tions are usually weakly cliticized to the preceding word. I consistently represent
particles as independent words in this grammar in the interests of consistency.
Garrwa speakers treat them as independent words.
     Garrwa clitics are always prosodically dependent on the preceding word, and
speakers do not typically treat them as independent words. Most clitics occur in
second position as part of the second-position clitic cluster within the core of the
Garrwa clause (§9.3.1). These include: tense and aspect markers (e.g., =yi ‘past’,
=yili ‘habitual’, =ngka ‘present’, and =ja= ‘future’ (§8.1.1)) and modal markers
(e.g., =kiyi ‘imperative (§8.1.2.1) and =wali ‘evidential’ (§8.1.2.4). Examples (3.16)
to (3.21) below illustrate these.(3.16)     yanyba=yi       ngayu         all day     wulani

          ‘That snake might be alive.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)As noted in §3.2.3.1 above, Garrwa pronouns are typically found as part of the
second-position clitic complex. As with particles, I consistently write them as
separate words, although it is clear that pronouns in the second position are
phonetically dependent on the preceding word in discourse. Modal clitics always
directly attach to the word in core-initial position. The examples above have tense
or aspect clitics attached to the second-position pronoun. However, as Mushin
(2008) and §8.1.1 of this book discuss, tense and aspect clitics can also directly
attach to the core-initial word and can precede the pronoun, which (3.22) illus-
trates with the past tense clitic =yi (=i when attached to pronouns).(3.22)    a.     wilku=yi      ngayu        baki    jilajba=yi      ngayu

4 Nouns
Garrwa nouns are formally identified by morphological processes specifically
associated with this word class. Case marking is the most frequent and salient
morphology associated with nouns. Nouns form a large open class with many
subclasses (not all of which are themselves open-class categories). Noun sub-
classes are identified on the basis of their distribution, meaning, and case allo-
morphy. In this chapter, I describe the morphological and distributional proper-
ties of common and proper nouns, kin terms, and quantifying nouns. I describe
interrogative words, which mostly pattern with nouns, in Chapter 6.
     Common nouns cover a large range of semantic types that includes words
referring to people, animate and inanimate natural objects, man-made objects,
and qualities of objects. Unlike many languages in this region, Garrwa has no
grammatical system of noun classification. There is also no verbal agreement or
obligatory pronominal cross-referencing. These are all common morphological
strategies among Australian languages for identifying referents and maintain-
ing reference in discourse. In this context, Garrwa looks morphologically poor,
but Garrwa speakers have various strategies to establish and maintain reference,
such as choosing the referring expression (e.g., noun vs. pronoun vs. zero) and/
or the word order.","[60, 61, 62]"

The habitual clitic =(y)ili is almost always used for a habitual meaning in the past
– ‘used to do X’ – or a durative or iterative meaning in the past – ‘kept doing X’.
Its focus is on the aspectual features of durativity and repetition of the activity or
events in question when they were being undertaken. In my data, the allomorph
=yili attaches to anything other than a pronoun, while =ili attaches to pronouns.
The attachment patterns of =yili are considerably more varied than both =yi ‘past’
and =ngka ‘present’.
     The difference between =(y)ili’s habitual and iterative meanings seems to
depend on the time scale of the event or activity being expressed. A habitual
meaning concerns activities that take place over an indefinite period of time

(although no longer in the present), and is the default TA clitic for talking about
the way Garrwa people lived in the old days. Examples (8.12) and (8.13) illustrate
this meaning.(8.12)     kuyu=yili ngama-ngi          wayka bak=ili        yarrijba,

           ‘They (working men) would go and put up fences. While I would be at
           the camp, staying and cooking food. I used to cook food. I used to make
           clothes.’ (28.3.00.3.TD)The clitic =yili takes on a past durative or iterative meaning when the timeframe
of the event or activity is more restricted. For example, in narratives, a =yili-
marked clause indicates that the action in question occurs repeatedly for some
duration during narrative time, but that it is bound by subsequent events in the
narrative. For example, in both (8.14) and (8.15), the protagonists are staring at
other character in the story. In (8.14), the protagonist stares at an apparition of
the storyteller’s father. In (8.15), the protagonist is staring at a woman with sexual
intent. In both cases, =yili is used to mark the durativity of the staring – that
these characters are watching beyond a stretch of time normally associated with
this activity. However, following this particular episode, the story moves to other
events that occur after this staring event.

          ‘But that boy kept sitting there, (he) kept on looking (at her).’
          (9.5.01.1.KS)The examples given thus far illustrate =yili attached to anything other than a
pronoun. In earlier descriptions of Garrwa (e.g., Belfrage 2003; Furby and Furby
1977), =yili’s form was given as =kili, with no mention of the lenited form =yili.
This may reflect a varietal difference between Robinson River and other varie-
ties. Speakers who originated from Robinson River station used =yili. Speakers
from elsewhere (including Wollogorang and Wandangula) were more likely to use
=kili, although they also used =yili. This might account for the differences in data
(e.g., Belfrage collected much of his data from people in Wandangula, close to
Borroloola). The following examples, from my own data, are from speakers from
Wollogorang and Wandangula, respectively.(8.16)    badibadi       ngaki ngawuji kajurra=kili nanga-ndu

          ‘(He) used to make a humpy like that.’ (19.4.00.1.DMcD)For all speakers, =ili is the allomorph used with pronouns. The final vowel of
the pronoun is omitted in all cases. This is also the case following the accusative
suffix -nya, which (8.20) illustrates.

          ‘Trousers, (they) would give us.’ (25.8.03.1.ER)As Mushin (2008) discusses, =yili has different distributional properties than
both =yi and =ngka. Like =yi and =ngka, =yili has scope over the whole clause in
which it occurs. It occurs in every clause in texts, except in cases of clause chain-
ing where, like other TA clitics, =yili need only be marked in the first clause of
the chain (see §9.6.3). Where =yi and =ngka are restricted to attaching to second-
position pronouns or initial verbs, =yili attaches to these and a wide range of
other forms. These include:a) Attached to a second-position pronoun(8.21)    wadararrijba   yal=ili          yaji

different from the other clitics, which only attach to verbs or pronouns. Note that
most initial elements only occur in initial position in contexts of prominence, so
it may be that =yili is attracted to a marked prominent element in these cases.
Examples (8.27) and (8.28) illustrate =yili attached to initial nominals; example
(8.29) illustrates it attached to demonstratives; example (8.30) illustrates it
attached to temporal adverbials; and example (8.31) illustrates it attached to a
nominal group that comprises a co-referential demonstrative and nominal.(8.27)      wabula=yili         yalu-ngka daba

            (2.5.01.1.KS)In summary, =yili is the least restrictive of the TA clitics based on where it can
occur. In all cases, however, =yili either attaches to the initial element or a second-
position element. In clauses where there is both a verb and a pronoun present,
there seems to be considerable variability in whether speakers place =yili directly
after the verb or directly after the pronoun. Some speakers prefer pronoun attach-
ment, which suggests a parallelism with =yi and =ngka, while others prefer ini-
tial-verb attachment. Given that =yili regularly attaches to any initial constituent,
including conjunctions and initial (prominent) nominals, this suggests that, for
these speakers, =yili is more like other modal clitics (e.g., =kiyi (§8.1.2.1) and =wali
(§8.2.1.4)) that attach to an initial constituent regardless of word class, and occur
prior to second-position pronouns.
     =Yili is also the only clitic that can follow a clause-combining particle. As
described in §8.3, co-ordinating conjunctions baki, mada, and jala seem to
operate outside of initial position to determine second-position pronoun place-
ment. The constituent directly following such conjunctions can be counted as in
initial position. But, unlike other forms that directly follow conjunctions, =yili
cannot occur utterance initially.","[226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"

"7.2.3 Productivity of verb derivationThere are clearly some differences in the productivity of verb derivation according
to class. It seems easiest to derive new verbs in class 1, and it is unclear whether
it is possible to derive new class 2B verbs at all. There are many examples of
nominal roots in the corpus that form the basis for class 1 and 2 verbs. In all of
these examples, the class 1 form has a causative meaning, while the class 2 form
has a stative/inchoative meaning.(7.67)    badawa ‘hole’                        badawa-j-ba ‘come out of a hole’

meaning associated with their root. Despite this, there is often no independent
word, nominal, or otherwise that corresponds to these roots.(7.68)     *jarri       jarri-j-ba ‘be absent’    jarri-mba ‘take away’These examples further reinforce the analysis that -j is an inchoative stem and
that -mba is a causative stem, at least in derived verbs. There is little evidence that
these productive meanings apply to true verbs, however, which leaves open the
question of when the stem forms acquired these meanings. If they were originally
causative and inchoative stem forms, then we might expect some reflexes of these
meanings in the true verbs as well as the derived verbs. The fact that we do not
find clear reflexes suggests that the assignment of meanings to these conjugation
classes is a later, albeit well-entrenched, phenomenon.","[194, 195]"

is possessed. In (5.14) below, TD lists women who are known to be good dancers.
In the first possessive phrase, the possessive pronoun precedes the possessed
noun; in the second, the possessed noun precedes the possessive pronoun.(5.14)     ngaki    ngadanganja        mimina      nganyi

Pronouns in locative case are typically translated as ‘with X’ rather than ‘at X’,
which reflects the fact that being at the location of another person (or groups of
people) implies that this person (or people) is engaged in social activities, not just
that they are located at some fixed point or area.(5.15)     mada          nayi-ba   malbu       bukakanya jungku=yi

                 kal-kanyi                          ‘cut-irr’Like class 1 basic verbs, class 2 verbs have a wide range of meanings and valency
types. However, it is still unclear why some verbs in this class retain the -j stem in
the unmarked form while others do not. There does not appear to be any phono-
logical reason for this. For example, the unmarked form of the verb ‘see’ is najba,
but the unmarked form of the verb ‘hit’ is daba, yet dajba is a possible word, as
is naba. An alternative analysis would reanalyse the final -j of class 2A verbs as
part of the verb root. This would account for the occurrence of -j- in the unmarked
forms.
     However, there are some verbs in which the root form alternates with the
unmarked form. One of these is the very discourse-frequent motion verb jila ~
jilajba ‘walk’, which is often used generically for moving from one place to
another. It is not deictic, so the motion can be towards or away from the centre of
deixis. It is not clear what the motivation is for selecting one form of ‘walk’ over
another. Some speakers appear to prefer jila to jilajba for the main verb in simple
sentences, but all speakers accept both forms.(7.11)     jila     ja=ninji         biri-ji        wayka        yalu-ngi
           walk     fut=2sgnom       sing-purp      down         3pl-dat

           walk       fut=1sgnom        down          bird-dat        hunt

           where        fut=1plInclnom        walk       next.day

These examples confirm that the root form of jila ~ jilajba should be analysed as
jila rather than jilaj.⁵⁴ It seems reasonable, therefore, to apply this analysis to the
whole class and retain -j as a stem-forming affix.","[179, 180, 181]"

"2.5.1 ReduplicationApart from suffixation, reduplication is the only other productive morphologi-
cal process in Garrwa. It seems that all common nominal and verbal words have
the potential to be reduplicated. Verb reduplication is discussed in more detail
in §7.3.4. Here, I focus on reduplication of nominals and adverbials. The general
rule, regardless of word class, is that two-syllable roots totally reduplicate the
first syllable and three-syllable roots and higher reduplicate the second syllable
only. Sometimes, the final syllable is reduplicated in three-syllable roots (as with
bankulu ~ bankululu below).
     Examples (2.38) and (2.39) illustrate some two-syllable roots.(2.38)    /burrku/     ‘tail’    /burrkuburrkun/ ‘tail feather of emu (big tail)’
          /larrwa/     ‘pipe’    /larrbalarrba/  ‘pipe’ (alternative form)
          /malbu/      ‘old man’ /malbumalbu/    ‘old men’As §2.1.4 above notes, some reduplicated two-syllable words show lenition in the
first consonant of the reduplicated form.(2.39)    /bala/        ‘forked stick’      /balawala/          ‘forked sticks’
          /kaburr/      ‘uninitiated boy’   /kaburrwaburr/      ‘uninitiated boys’
          /kamu/        ‘later’             /kamuwamu/          ‘much later’Examples (2.40) to (2.43) illustrate some three-syllable and higher roots.(2.40)    /bankulu/          ‘stone axe’       /bankululu/       ‘stone axes’
          /bajangu/          ‘dog’             /bajajangu/       ‘dogs’
          /badibadi/         ‘old woman’       /badidibadi/      ‘old women’Partial reduplication of dyadic kin terms is productively used to indicate more
than one member of the dyad is present in the group. For example:
30       Phonology(2.41)    /bawakula/        ‘two brothers (of the same parents)’
          /bawawakula/      ‘a group of brothers’
          /kawuju/          ‘woman and her brother’s daughter’
          /kawuwuju/        ‘a group of three or more people in the
                            relationship of woman and her brother’s daughter’In most cases, reduplicated nominals indicate plurality, whereas reduplicated
adverbials are intensified. In all of the examples above, there is no change in
word class between the reduplicated and unreduplicated forms. However, there
are some examples of reduplicated nominals that appear to derive from unredu-
plicated verb roots. For example:(2.42)    /ngarra-j-ba/      ‘be hot’     /ngarrangarra/          ‘hot (one)’
          /ngundurr-ba/      ‘snore’      /ngundurrngundurr/      ‘windpipe’There are also many nouns that have the form of reduplications but which lack
unreduplicated counterparts, at least in contemporary Garrwa.(2.43)    /bududabududa/                      ‘swollen’
          /bunyulbunyul/                      ‘soft, rotten’
          /kalirrkalirr/                      ‘boney’
          /kijirrikijirri/                    ‘Willy Wagtail’
          /mulyamulya/                        ‘sack’
          /munjimunji/                        ‘bush’
          /ridiridi/                          ‘walking stick’
          /wakadawakada/                      ‘cattle’2.5.2 Loss of segments in connected speechIn connected speech, speakers commonly omit final-/i/ vowels, especially when
they follow a velar, a palatal nasal, or a palatal guide. This is especially common
in allomorphs of the dative case /-nyi/ for nouns and/-ngi/ for pronouns.(2.44)    /nanga-ngi/        [ˈnaŋaŋɪ] ~ [ˈnaŋaŋ]       ‘3sg-dat’
          /wawarra-nyi/      [ˈwawaˌraɲɪ] ~ [ˈwawaˌraɲ] ‘child-dat’
          /jila=nyi/         [jilaʲɲ]                   ‘walk=hort’
                                                            English loanwords     31
There is a tendency for the first syllable to be omitted (i.e., the last syllable on
the first word) when syllables with at least the same onset (if not the same form
altogether) are adjacent.(2.45)    /wanya nyulu/            [wanjʊlʊ]                 ‘what’s that’2.6 English loanwordsGarrwa has borrowed many words from English, some perhaps indirectly through
Kriol. Regular phonological changes include the regular use of /j/ for English /s/
/z/, /sh/ (e.g., jimuku ‘smoke’, yujimba ‘use’, and jadanyi ‘shirt’), /b/ for /f/ and
/v/ (e.g., bilawa ‘flour’, babulun ‘buffalo’, and kabikabi ‘calf’), and the splitting
up of English consonant clusters with the vowel /i/ (e.g., jiwayiki ‘swag’ and
birijin ‘prison’).
     Loan verbs inflect as Garrwa verbs and behave as class 1 stems (§7.1.1). This
seems to be a productive process because some of the forms in the corpus have
not even phonologically adapted to Garrwa (e.g., waystimba ‘waste’ and ray-
dimba ‘ride’).(2.46)    yadimba                              ‘corral’ (from ‘yard’)

          kilinimba                            ‘clean’

3 Grammatical overview
In this chapter, I describe some of Garrwa’s key typological features and briefly
overview the morphological and syntactic properties of the word classes in the
language.
     Like many other Australian languages, Garrwa has two open classes of lexical
items (nouns and verbs), both of which have distinctive inflectional and syntactic
properties. Nouns are described in detail in Chapter 4, and verbs are described
in detail in Chapter 7. Closed word classes include pronouns (Chapter 5), demon-
stratives (Chapter 6), and directionals (Chapter 6). These closed classes also have
distinctive morphological and syntactic properties. There is a large, but probably
closed, class of forms that do not take inflectional morphology: I call these parti-
cles. These are mostly described in Chapters 8 and 10.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"

May 2001 at Macarthur River Caravan Park. Also present: Ilana Mushin.
    This text was elicited at the start of my 2001. I had arrived in Borroloola fol-
lowing a particularly wet March/April where part of the town was flooded. This
prompted memories of a previous large flood brought on by Cyclone Kathy in
1985. This is the flood mention as occurring when some of the speakers were in
Burketown (a town well to the east of Borroloola in Queensland).","[399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416]"

                  your belly, this flu (retching).’ (3.9.03.4)Yuku is frequently followed by barri ‘pi’ at the beginning of utterances to signal
that things are well. In (10.27), which is from a narrative, yuku is a marker of posi-
tive assessment to characterize the distribution of clean clothes as a good thing.
This was originally translated by the speaker as ‘We were happy (to have clean
clothes)’.

          (=keep them) – finished”. Eh, This is all right, to sit (with clean
          clothes).’ (8.9.10.TD)There are a number of contexts where yuku is used without direct reference to
physical wellbeing, although there may be indirect implications for wellbeing.
In (10.28), the speaker is reassuring the addressee that she can understand the
language being spoken.(10.28)   yuku            barri ngayu          manku nayi         jangkurr

          ‘It’s all right. I can hear this language.’ (11.8.03.1.TD)In (10.29), yuku is used to signal a realization of correct information; for example,
the right European name for a Garrwa place. ER and TD have been discussing
a recent trip they took together from Borroloola to Robinson River. ER asks the
original question before suggesting the Wearyan river. TD checks that this is not
Kalalakina, a different Garrwa place, before ER recognizes Bujiwunyi as a part
of the Folsche river (i.e., not the Wearyan), which is accompanied by yuku. This
assertion is immediately accepted by TD.","[336, 337]"

nungkala, ngambala, and ngaliya) and a disyllabic form that omits the final syl-
lable.³⁰ These are the only pronouns to alternate in this way. For these four pro-
nouns, their trisyllabic form is the form given in elicitation. It is the form always
used in contexts of prominence (e.g., contrast or emphasis), and follows the con-
trastive particle ngala (see §8.3.3) in utterance-initial position.(5.20)      nayi-ba     nayi, nimbala       jungku kangku-na
            this-deic this     2dunom       sit         FF-loc

            contr       1duExclnom sit    that-deic 1sgdat yB
            ‘…While we two stayed over there, my younger brother (and I).’
            (15.5.01.1.DG)(5.22)      waja      nungkala        yanyba=ya
            quick     1duInclnom say=pres
            ‘Quick, you and I (better) talk…’ (3.9.03.4.DG)
30 The disyllabic forms of these pronouns are the standard forms in Waanyi.

          now       like            other(redup)
          ‘No, anyway, we’re like a different people living here now.’ (20.6.08.DG)These pronouns’ disyllabic forms are found in a range of contexts; some alternate
with their trisyllabic form.a) Non-nominative contexts
The trisyllabic forms 1plInclnom ngambala and 2dunom nimbala are regularly
used in non-nominative contexts (the non-nominative root of the 1duIncl pronoun
(nominative form – nungkala) is the suppletive niya-).(5.24)    nimbala-ngi ngayu,         nijanganjinyi nimbala-ngi       (*nimba-ngi)
          2du-dat         1sgnom father               2du-dat

          neg=place 1plIncl-dat             car-dat
          ‘(There were) no cars for us.’ (22.8.02.1.ER)However, the disyllabic form of the 1plIncl pronoun (ngama) is also sometimes
found in non-nominative contexts, which (5.26) illustrates. The disyllabic form of
the 1duExcl pronoun (ngali) is always used in non-nominative contexts.(5.26)    miku-wali wanbiya nayi, julaki               ngama-ngi        wada-yudi
          neg-evid arrive           this, airplane 1plIncl-dat          food-with

          like.this say         1duExcl-dat                 that     old.man
          ‘Like that, he says to us, that old man.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)b) Second position
When the four non-singular pronouns are in second position, their disyllabic
form is the more frequent choice. Note that these pronouns are mostly destressed
in this position.

           wash         2dunom things
           ‘You two wash (the) things.’ (28.3.00.1.KS)(5.31)     yangka       ngamba        balba     munganawa
           which.way    1plInclnom go           next.day
           ‘Which way are we going tomorrow?’ (2.5.01.1.KS)(5.32)     balba    ngali            bayungu
           go       1duExclnom west
           ‘We two went west.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)The pronouns’ trisyllabic forms may also occur in second position, albeit much
less frequently than their disyllabic forms. Examples (5.33) to (5.35) illustrate this
in discourse.(5.33)     wanjawa nungkala       baya-muku narriyalama
           where       1duInclnom child-pl   tree.sugarbag
           ‘Where are we two and the children (going to find) sugarbag?’
           (3.9.03.4.DG)(5.34)     yarrijba ngambala         nani,         ngandu nani
           put        1plinclnom like.this shade          like.this
           ‘We built a shade like this.’ (1.5.01.1.KS)(5.35)     ningkijba=yili ngaliya          nani
           watch=hab       1duExclnom like.this
           ‘We would look (at him) like that.’ (15.5.01.DG)c) Pronoun-pronoun combinations
The disyllabic form is always used when a nominative pronoun precedes another
pronoun (accusative or oblique), which examples (5.36) to (5.39) illustrate.
92       Pronouns(5.36)    nayi kujarra ngarrkadaba nungka                  bula-nya

          teach        1duExclnom 2sgacc
          ‘We two are teaching you.’ (11.8.03.1.ER)(5.38)    ngarrkadaba ngamba              yalu-nya
          spear          1plInclnom       3pl-acc

          sing      1duExclnom 3pl-dat
          ‘We sang for them.’ (21.8.03.3.TD)d) Future tense
The disyllabic forms of these pronouns are also frequently, but not exclusively,
used when following the future marker ja (§8.1.1.4). The following examples dem-
onstrate the use of both forms with future tense.(5.40)    wijba    ja=nungka
          return fut=1duInclnom
          ‘You and I are going to go back.’ (3.9.03.4.DG)(5.41)    ja=nungkala          kuluku kula-rra

          ‘We’re going to spear (you) here from the east...’ (11.5.01.1.KS)
                                                       Compound pronouns        93

          ‘We’re going to write down language.’ (22.3.00.1.DmcD)Given that the closely related Waanyi language only has disyllabic pronouns, it is
possible that the trisyllabic forms in Garrwa are newer augments that developed
to mark emphatic pronouns. Clearly, the trisyllabic forms occur in more emphatic
and prominent contexts (which includes citing these pronouns in elicitation),
and the disyllabic forms do not occur in these contexts. However, the variation
in non-emphatic contexts suggests that, for contemporary Garrwa, the trisyllabic
forms are not exclusively associated with emphasis or prominence.","[106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111]"

morphological features of kinship nouns.
     The suffix -nganja can attach productively to kin terms to indicate an ana-
phoric prepositus (anaph), which is co-referential with any prepositus referent
regardless of person or number.²¹ It is only used with kinship nouns. Examples
(4.6) to (4.9) show that nganja can occur on third and first person pronouns.(4.6)       badibadi-yurru,    ngaki-nkurru        ngada-nganja-rru
            old.woman-dec      1sgdat-dec          M-anaph-dec
            ‘That old woman my mother.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)(4.7)       nayi=li       yalu         yingijba    na-nkanyi      nanga-ngi

            ngada-nganja
            M-anaph
            ‘They used to leave that one (HG), her mother behind.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)(4.8)       karu=yi        ngayu        ngaki       bawa-nganja
            tell=past      1sgnom       1sgdat      eB-anaph
            ‘I told my older brother…’ (Belfrage Field 1991 notes)
21 This suffix is also used productively in Waanyi. I am grateful to the anonymous reviewer for
clarifying the analysis of -nganja as a general anaphoric suffix.
                                                               Kinship nouns       51

           ‘The boy helped his older brother.’ (Belfrage field notes 1991)If there is no pronoun, the prepositus is unspecified. For example, in (4.10),
the mothers are mothers of goats within a herd of goats. In (4.11), which is the
opening utterance of an elicited narrative, the mother turns out to be the mother
of the main character, but this is not yet specified (note the translation as ‘mother’
rather than ‘his mother’).(4.10)     yarrijba kudiya-mba           kidikidi nayi, ngada-nganja nayi,
           put         some-class1       kid      this     M-anaph           this
           munganawanyja
           until.next.day
           ‘Put half the goats – kids here, mothers here (in a different place) until
           tomorrow morning.’ (8.9.10.TD)(4.11)     ngada-nganja, kuluka=yi
           M-anaph          sleep=past
           ‘Mother was sleeping.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)As they are used to clarify reference to the prepositus, forms with -nganja are
common in discourse. Kinship nouns that lack both -nganja and a specifying
dative pronoun are interpreted as having a first person prepositus (‘my X’).(4.12)     yingamali yal=i               wudumba-yi         maju-yurru
           one          3plnom=past      get=past           eZ-dec
           badibadi-yurru
           old.woman-dec
           ‘They got one – my deceased older sister.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)(4.13)     ngaki-nmuku=yili yalu,       jila  nayi, kawuja-rru Nyanja
           1sgdat-pl=hab      3plnom walk this        FZ-dec       Name
           ‘All this mob of mine used to come, (including) my aunt Nyanja.’
           (3.9.03.4.KS)This suffix is not entirely productive as some forms are never found with -nganja
(e.g., kukudi ‘MM’ and kangku ‘FF’), while others only ever occur with the -nganja
suffix.

marked) pronouns with the kin term (with or without -nganja) to indicate the pos-
sessor, or a derived verb form of the kin term (using class 1 verb morphology – see
§7.1.1), with a pronominal possessor in nominative case. This construction has
the semblance of a predicate+subject structure, although it is clearly used in dis-
course exclusively to attribute a kin term to its possessor. This is clearly shown in
(4.15) where the nominal referent “Lobby” is ergatively marked (as the transitive
subject of the clause), but there is no equivalent or comparable inflection in the
kinship ascription.(4.14)     wanjawa       nanda yingka kujarra walkurra ngaki

           ‘Lobby, his grandson, shot the emu.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 3.1.2.4)Kin terms take the same case-marking morphology as common nouns, which
supports their analysis as a noun type. This is illustrated in (4.16) to (4.18). A
detailed description of nominal case-marking is given in §4.4.(4.16)     wakaramba nyul=i                nganyi-nkanyi ngada-nganja-nyi

other languages of the region (e.g., Wambaya).

put these together under elicitation conditions to form higher numbers: kujarra
yingamali ‘three’, kujarra baki kujarra ‘four’ (lit. ‘two and two’), kujarra kujarra
baki yingamali ‘five’ (lit. ‘two, two, and one’), and so on. The form murrku may
also be used to refer to small quantities (three, four, or five). Speakers tend to
translate murrku as ‘three’ when asked, but it is more common for the precise
number ‘three’ to be designated by combining kujarra and yingamali in discourse.(4.19)    nayi     kujarra, ngarrkadaba nungka                  bula-nya

54       NounsAs (4.22) illustrates, the suffix -ka is only found attached to kujarra and murrku
to mean ‘two nights’ and ‘three nights’, respectively. It does not attach to other
quantifying nouns.
     Besides numerals, there are a number of other quantifying nominals. These
include: kaja ‘many’, kudiya ‘some’, and yingka ‘another’. Kaja denotes a quan-
tity larger than murrku ‘three’. Kudiya denotes a proportion of a whole set (‘some
of X’). Yingka denotes a single referent different from aforementioned and is redu-
plicated for plural reference. These quantifying nominals can occur alone or in
nominal groups.(4.23)    wijkunumba=yi     yalu       kaja        nyinbu

          (3.9.03.3.KS)4.4 Nominal case-markingCase marking morphology largely functions to mark the role a nominal or group
of nouns plays in a clause. Furby and Furby (1977) identify seven cases: “erga-
tive”, “accusative”, “referent” (= “dative”), “locative”, “allative”, “ablative”, and
“translocative”. The morphological and semantic properties of these cases are
discussed in §4.4.1 to §4.4.6. There are some grounds for treating the associative
or having suffix -yudi (§4.5.1) as a case marker because it also indicates the role a
nominal plays in its clause. However, it is classified here among “other nominal
morphology” (§4.5) for reasons discussed below.
     In terms of the system of core case-marking, Garrwa has a split ergative
system. All nominal types except pronouns (i.e., demonstratives, interrogatives,
                                                        Nominal case-marking     57
kin terms, quantifier nominals, and common nouns) mark transitive subjects (A)
with an ergative suffix, while intransitive subjects (S) and transitive objects (O)
are not marked (absolutive). All pronouns mark transitive objects with an accusa-
tive suffix, but leave transitive and intransitive subjects unmarked (nominative),
which Table 7 illustrates.","[67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]"

matical functions in the clause (A, S, or O), b) signalling oblique grammatical
functions, and c) signalling a nominal’s spatial relationship with respect to the
state of affairs described in the clause. The morphemes described above as case
suffixes share the paradigmatic property of being the final morpheme in an
inflected word, should a word consist of a root and more than one morpheme.
There are also a small number of morphemes that attach exclusively to nominal
forms, but which are not part of the case paradigm.

4.5.1 Yudi ‘with’This morpheme is used in most cases of alienable possession (which is some-
times called associative case). It only occurs with non-human common nouns –
pronominals and human nominals use locative or dative case to signal an asso-
ciative/alienable possession relationship (see §4.7 for more on possession). While
-yudi shares properties with case markers as a marker of the role the nominal
plays in the clause, its restriction to non-human common nouns only and its
capacity to be followed by another case marker suggests that it is a different type
of morpheme from those described in §4.4.(4.137)   makirra-yudi      nanda ngila
          paint-with        that      girl

          ‘She went with them, carrying (a swag) on her head, wearing a possum
          hair skirt.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)In the following example, the -yudi-marked nominal groups seems to function
more like instruments than simple alienable possessives.(4.141)   wajarrijba nurr=i                   wanka-yudi kaku-yudi

          ‘You’re going to talk well with good language, good girl.’ (3.9.03.4.DG)
76        NounsIn most instances, instruments are marked with a locative case marker (§4.4.3),
although there are some examples (as above) where -yudi marks a nominal that
can be construed as an instrument. These tend to occur in transitive contexts
where the subject has ergative marking (unless it is a pronoun); when functioning
as an instrument, the -yudi marked nominals also take ergative marking. There
are no cases where ergatively marked nominals function as instruments without
-yudi. Note that, while the first two examples have body parts as instruments, the
second two examples do not. This suggests that alienability is not a factor in this
construction.(4.143)    daba ngayu          mani-yudi-nyi     jamba

           ‘I’m going to cut this (wood for coolamon) directly, really deep down.’
           (3.9.03.4.KS)In comparative contexts, -mirra is used to indicate the superlative member of a
set.(4.147)    nayinda walkurra-mirra
           this        big-intens
           ‘This one is the biggest (of three jars).’ (Mushin 2011 field notes)There is no equivalent comparative morpheme, nor is there a comparative con-
struction that explicitly compares two items in the same grammatical unit. When
speakers need to make comparisons or identify something as having the most
of a quality, they do so with intensifiers and juxtaposed utterances. The particle
bijal ‘partly, a little bit’ may be used to indicate that one member of a set of two is
greater on some scale than the other member.(4.148)    nayinda      bijal     walkurra
           this         part      big

           ‘This one is smaller (of two jars) / this is a smaller one.’ (Mushin 2011
           field notes)4.5.3 -Yurru ‘deceased’This morpheme occurs attached to human nominals and kin terms to indicate
that the person in question is deceased. It does not occur with proper names.
The euphemistic term mudinyi is used in place of the proper name of a recently
deceased person.
78         NounsThere are a number allomorphs of -yurru. Determiners (including possessive pro-
nouns) take the form -nkurru.²⁸ The first syllable /yu/ is omitted when the nominal
root has a final syllable with a palatal onset (same morphophonemic principle as
applies to the allative suffix -yurri). The following example illustrates all of the
allomorphs.(4.150)     nayi Wakudi nayi kabuji           nayi, yurru-yurru,
            this name          this blind.one this old.woman-dec
            ngaki-nkurru, ngada-nganja-rru
            1sgdat-dec       M-anaph-dec
            ‘This Wakudi, this blind one (nickname), this old woman my mother
            (deceased).’ (3.9.03.4.KS)(4.151)     ngaki-nmuku=yili yalu,         jila     nayi, kawuja-rru Nyanja

            ‘All this mob used to come here, my deceased aunt Nyanja.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)The next example shows that -yurru is optional with the possessive pronoun.
Note, however, that in this example (cf. (5.150) above), the pronoun occurs after
an intonation break, and may therefore be considered an increment (i.e., clarify-
ing whose grandfather).(4.152)     balba nurr=i                  kangku-yurru, ngaki
            go      1plExclnom=past FF-dec                   1sgdat
            ‘We went, (with) father’s father, my one.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)4.6 Number marking for human referentsGarrwa has dual (-wuya) and plural (-muku) suffixes that obligatorily attach to
nominals with human referents, which includes kin terms and demonstratives
referring to humans. Nominals that denote attributes of humans may also take
number marking. Animal references can also take number marking, although
this does not appear to be obligatory (see examples below). Inanimates never
take these number markers.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"
"8.1.1.1 =Yi ‘past’
The past clitic =yi is most regularly used to refer to events in the past time relative
to the time of speaking. These typically involve events that have finished in the
past and are no longer in process in the present (i.e., completed events). It is the
default tense for narration, which the narrative excerpt in (8.1) illustrates. In this
                                                                      Clitics      205
example, every clause that represents an actualized narrative event is marked
with =yi.(8.1)      bijba=yi      marrimba=yi nanda madumbarra                     nanda

           ‘…That crocodile bit and grabbed at that whitefella (while he) tried to
           swim on the east side. That crocodile grabbed him, a long time ago. (It)
           ate (him) all up. (It) ate (him) raw. The end.’ (24.3.00.1.DR)The full form =yi is used when attached to verbs. An =i allomorph occurs when =yi
is attached to pronouns. For pronouns that already end in /i/ (e.g., ninji ‘2sg’ and
narri ‘2pl’), it is difficult to hear whether the clitic is present or not: for example,
the vowel is not especially lengthened(cf. /iyi/ combinations in other contexts).
In (8.2), which is from Belfrage’s 1991 field notes, the clitic clearly follows the
pronoun in the conjoined clause, but there is no phonological evidence that it is
marked on the first clause, although the clause is clearly past tense from context.(8.2)      malwanumba nganinji(=i??)         baki    kulwa
           frighten        1sgacc/2sgnom and         look.back

           1sgnom=past        2sg-loc-all
           ‘You frightened me and I looked back at you.’ (Belfrage 1991 field notes)In the vast majority of clauses, =yi attaches to a verb or to a second-position
pronoun in a main clause. Occasionally it may be found on both the verb and
pronoun, although this is generally less preferred by some speakers, and dis-
counted altogether by others. The past form of the relative conjunction jala is jali,
which may be jala=yi.
     In Mushin (2008), a study based on a corpus of 315 narrative clauses, in clauses
that had both a verb and a pronoun present, the clitic attached to pronouns 66%
of the time. This corpus only included third person (i.e., non-personal) narratives,
however, which meant that a relatively larger number of clauses had no pronoun
206         Clitics and particlespresent at all.⁶⁷ If we examine the larger corpus used for this book that includes
elicited data, personal as well as traditional and non-personal narratives, and
conversations, the data indicates a broader preference for =yi to attach to second-
position pronouns rather than to verbs when they are present⁶⁸, but there is vari-
ation in single texts as well as across different texts and speakers.
     Examples (8.3) to (8.7) illustrate the variation in =yi attachment across dif-
ferent kinds of pronouns: 1sgnom, 3plnom, reflexive, and compound. In each of
these text examples, speakers considered the converse possibility acceptable.","[222, 223, 224]"
"2.1.5 Consonant clustersConsonant clusters appear word medially, never word initially or finally. They
may be morpheme initial as in the case of some suffixes (see below). Combina-
tions tend to maximize differences between both place and manner of articula-
tion. There are no geminate consonants and there is simplification of potential
geminate consonants occurring over morpheme boundaries. An example of this
is when class 2 verb stems that end in /j/ combine with verb inflectional mor-
phemes that begin with /j/; for example, the purposive suffix -ji.(2.14)    verb stem           suffix              word
          badaj-              -ji                 badaji (*badajji) ‘come-PURP’There are clear restrictions on combinations involving coronal consonants (alveo-
lar and palatal) – they may combine with bilabial and velar consonants but not
with each other. There are also no combinations of labial and velar consonants
(e.g., */mk/, */ngb/, and */wk/). The trill and alveolar lateral appear to pattern
together as liquids in combinations. Possible clusters are consistent with the
sonority hierarchy, with more or equally sonorous consonants preceding less
sonorous consonants (i.e., glides then liquids then nasals then stops). This rules
out stop-glide and nasal-glide combinations, although liquid-glide combinations
are possible.
     The following examples illustrate the possible clusters.
20       Phonologya) Homo-organic nasal-stop
All places of articulation allow for a homo-organic nasal-stop combination.(2.15)    /mb/                    /ngambala/              ‘1plInclNOM’
          /nd/                    /bundal/                ‘river’

          /ngk/                   /yangka/                ‘how many, which’b) Hetero-organic nasal stop
This cluster type only applies to coronal nasals /n/ and /ny/. There are no exam-
ples of /nyd/ as a cluster, which reflects a general avoidance of palatal-alveolar
consonant combinations.(2.16)    /nb/                 /nyinbu/              ‘echidna’
          /nj/                 /banjarrba/           ‘swim’
          /nk/                 /janki/               ‘back of neck’
          /nyb/                /yanyba/              ‘say’
          /nyk/                /yanyka/              ‘steady or purposeful walk’c) Nasal-nasal
There is no clear example of a /nyng/ combination, although it is theoretically
possible. The restriction on palatal+alveolar combinations results in no possible
*/nyn/ or */nny/ clusters.(2.17)    /nm/ /dinmanjan/       ‘black ant’
          /nym/ /nganymarrkijba/ ‘be dying of thirst’
          /ngm/ /bunaringma/     ‘Northern Wild Orange (Capparis umbonata)’
          /nng/ /banngarru/      ‘be dry (clothes)’Most combinations involving a liquid + consonant are restricted to combinations
with bilabial and velar consonants in the second slot.d) Liquid-stop

This is the only consonant cluster type that appears to violate the sonority hier-
archy. Only trill+labiovelar glides occur within word stems. The trill+ palatal
glide only occurs across morpheme boundaries. Without more detailed phonetic
analysis, it is difficult to tell whether the /ly/ combination is a single consonant
(palatal lateral) or a combination of an alveolar lateral and a glide. I analyse /
dalyamba/ ‘break’ as a word with a lateral+glide cluster because the initial /a/
vowel does not have a palatal offglide, which usually anticipates a forthcoming
palatal consonant (i.e., the word is pronounced [ˈdalˌjamba], not [ˈdaʲˌ ʎamba]).¹¹(2.20)      /rrw/                     /karrwa/                   ‘Garrwa’ (language name)

            /ly/                      /dalyamba/                 ‘break’Consonant clusters tend to be syllabified across syllables. Some suffixes and
enclitics begin with consonant clusters, but these are resyllabified when attached
to roots.(2.21)      /ngka/      =ngka

combinations. Such clusters are never found within roots.","[37, 38, 39]"
