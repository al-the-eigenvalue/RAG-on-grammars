3.3.1.1     Suffixes and clitics inducing penultimate     accentAs noted above, some suffixes and clitics ending in a C are treated for
accentual purposes as though they had an additional syllable (a nonsyllabic
suffix counts as having one syllable, a monosyllabic suffix counts as having
two, etc.). At any rate, they require word accent on the (surface) penult instead
                                                                3.3 Accent     85of the antepenult. It is probably best to treat this as a morphophonological fact,
simply stipulating that the suffixes and clitics in question have this effect on
word accent. I use the double grave accent ν to indicate surface accent due to
the effect of these morphemes
     Alternatively, one could argue for underlying representations of the
suffixes and clitics that have one more syllable than appears on the surface.
This could take the form of a final (or initial) unspecified vowel (V) that is
present when accentuation applies but is then dropped by a late, ad hoc
morphological rule.
     Another alternative would be to recognize floating accents on the left of
the morphemes in question (the accent would attach to a syllable to the left). A
floating-accent analysis would be most appropriate when the suffix or clitic is
monosyllabic (contains one vowel), and the accent ends up on the immediately
preceding syllable. This analysis is less attractive for cases (FeSg -t, 3MaSg
-\t) where the suffix or clitic is nonsyllablic (consists of just consonants), so
the accent ends up on a nonadjacent syllable farther to the left.
     The morphemes in question are those in (63).","[103, 104]"
"    The positive hortative forms illustrated here are negated by a special
hortative negative, which is formed from the Prohib stem in the long
imperfective system (§7.2.5.6).

set of entities exhorted or permitted to undertake the activity is indexed in the
grammatical subject. For example, if there is one speaker and one addressee,
'let's go!' has 1P1 subject.
     In the alternative construction to which we now turn, a 1P1 dative clitic is
added to an imperative. The overt subject of the imperative is Sg or PI
depending on the number of persons in question, excluding the speaker. This
imperative verb is followed by a 1 PI dative clitic, even if only two persons
(speaker and addressee) are present. The 1P1 dative can therefore be taken as
subsuming the 2nd person subject of the imperative. In this construction, 'let's
go!' for two persons (1st dual inclusive) is expressed as 'go!-Sg for us'. On the
other hand, 'let's go!' for three or more persons is expressed as 'go!-Pl for us',
the imperative being 2MaPl or 2FePl according to the sex of the addressees
(and any other included non-speaker referent). Data in (327) are valid for at
least T-ka and R dialects.","[341, 342]"

12.3     InterrogativesYes-no (i.e. polar) interrogatives are simple sentences with an optional
question particle, or just with interrogative intonation.
    WH-interrogatives are closely related to the focalization construction, but
usually omit the demonstrative following the focalized constituent.",[668]
"     The rule does not apply to nominal morphology, where Fe prefix t- is
never deleted. In the rare cases (involving loanwords) where Fe t- directly
precedes a C-initial stem that lacks a vocalic prefix, Schwa-Epenthesis applies
and we get ta- (§3.2.5). In several dialects, though not in T-ka, the FePI prefix
combination t-i- reduces (by Prefix Reduction) to t - 0 - before a stem beginning
in CV..., e.g. PI t-l-kabr-en 'sparrows', but reduced form (in a PP) d a e r
^t-O-kabr-en 'in the sparrows'. In this combination, the t- is not deletable.
(T-ka reduces -i- to schwa here: daer ""t-a-kabr-en.)
     Whether Prefixal t-Deletion also applies to the -t- prefix marking the long
imperfective stems in many verb classes is a tricky question. In those cases
where it appears audibly, this -t- is always followed by a V, so there is no
question of deletion. However, all cases (except one) where -t- is absent from a
long imperfective stem involve C-initial stems like LoImpfP -bdddasd- 'get
up' and causative -s-arad- 'wash'. Although I do not favor this analysis, one
might argue that -t- is underlyingly present here but is always deleted by
Prefixal t-Deletion.
     The one case where -t- is (or rather may be) absent from a long
imperfective stem is in the class of verbs of basic shape -vPvC-. Here the
LoImpfP varies between -aPPaC- and -t-aPPaC-, e.g. -awwat- and -t-awwat-
'hit'. We therefore have only equivocal evidence as to whether -t- is part of all
long imperfective stems. The alternative analysis is that - t - is in
complementary distribution with F-c2 (i.e. gemination of C2); see §3.4.2.1.
     In the type -aPPaC- varying with -t-aPPdC-, if a t- subject prefix is present
we always get e.g. phonetic ftaw:a't], which can be parsed morphologically as
either t-awwdt (with 3FeSg t-) or as 0-t-awwat from /t-t-awwat/.",[67]

lexicalized causative of the adjectival verb 'be big' in the contextual sense 'be
important' (PerfP maeqqor-). 'Be reduced' is the passive of -s-vdrvs- 'reduce',
causative of the adjectival verb 'be few, not much' (PerfP darus). To the extent
that the double derivation is logically transparent, the passive-of-causative
appears to have the underlying patient as subject ('X be caused to be big/few'),
with both the agent of the intervening causative and the outer agent omitted.
     'Be eaten' in (481.b) does not seem to differ much in meaning from
-amm-aksa-, the simple mediopassive on which it is based.

3.4.9.1        Presuffixal α-Shortening    (Non-Augment    Verbs)To begin with, non-augment V-Final verbs shorten a stem-final α to ae before
C-initial suffixes (but not clitics). This analysis is based on the assumption that
the stem-final V ' s in question (see §7.3.1.3, §7.3.1.5) would otherwise appear
as the full vowel a . The full set of C-initial suffixes that can follow an
inflectable verb stem are listed in (107).",[153]
"
7.1.2   Alternative segmentations of Augment -t-As with some other suffixes, there is some ambiguity as to the precise form of
the -t- augment. I segment it as -t- and assign the preceding as or a to the verb
stem. Certainly there is evidence that the stems in question end in a full V (it
appears overtly in the VblN, for example), so we need a V-Shortening rule that
applies to the V when it is followed by the augment. The closest parallel to this
is the shortening of a stem-final V (in unaugmented verbs) before C-initial
subject and Participial suffixes, e.g. PI Partpl -nen (§8.5.1). This analysis
allows us to take the final full V (i or u) that appears overtly in the VblN and
in the LoImpfP as lexical (except where a final u is attributable to spreading
from another medial u in the stem).
    However, other segmentations of the augment are also possible.
Alternative #1 is to segment the augment as -vt- (v = short vowel), realized as
-aet- or -at-. This strategy would require application of VV-Contraction,
effectively deleting the stem-final full V before the short V of the suffix. This
would entail hyphenating 'burst.PerfP' as -abbuqq-ast (instead of my
-abbuqqae-t), and its Sg Imprt as büqq-at (instead of buqqa-t). To account for
the alternation of -set- and -at- in this analysis, one could simply include the
augment in the scope of the respective stem melodies. Alternatively, we could
                                                         7.2 Stem categories       299allow the melodies to apply to the pre-VV-Contraction stem, then have the
stem-final V's high or low feature transferred to the augment-initial V as part
of the VV-Contraction process. A similar transfer occurs in VV-Contraction
examples involving unaugmented V-final stems in the Shlmpf, which end in
the underspecified high vowel hi (§3.1.2.4, §7.3.1.3).
     Alternative #2, which might be considered by readers who wish to
motivate the distinction between augmented and unaugmented V-final verbs
other than by lexical verb-class assignment, would be to take the augment as -t
as before, but to claim that verbs of the augment class end in underlying short
(not full) v. The difference between augment verbs and other V-final verbs
would then be predictable: augment verbs are simply those verbs ending in a
final short v. This would account directly for the surface ν in the augmented
forms ( a f f u r r a e - t , f u r r a - t , etc.). It would also permit a phonological
interpretation of the way VV-Contraction applies when the stem-final V is
directly followed by a V-initial subject suffix (-aer, -aed, -aem, -asn), see
(305.a), above. Specifically, we could posit /ae-as/ —> e in all of these
combinations. For unaugmented verbs, we would posit stem-final l a l in the
PerfP, so the VV-Contraction cases would have underlying l a - x l , which
surfaces as either ae or e depending on which suffixal category is involved
(§7.3.1.1).
     Alternatives #1 and #2 each have some attractive features. I reject
alternative #1 since the VblN and other nominals show a clear stem-final full
V (with no Augment). I reject alternative #2 since there is no other evidence
for positing stem-final short V's (contrasting in phonological behavior both
with full V's and with deletable stem-final V's).","[317, 318]"

3.2.7     Syncope and Leftward L-Spreading3.2.7.1     SyncopeIn some positions, a Syncope rule affecting /a/, and arguably /ae/, appears to
apply. Whether or not the rule affects only /a/ (asymmetrical version) or
applies equally to both /a/ and /ae/ (symmetrical version) depends on decisions
about how to represent the stems in question. The data just below on Syncope
are for T-ka, while some dialectological color is given at the end of this
section.
    The most important cases of Stem-Initial Syncope involve alternations of
stem-initial surface -CvCV... and -vCCV... in verbs, where ""v"" is a short
vowel and ""V"" is any vowel. Consider the examples in (51).",[92]
"3.4.7   V-Height CompromiseAs just mentioned, there are some full-V-initial light stems (-uCi>, -uCvC-,
-uCCi>, etc.) and some -CuCvC- stems with full (high) V after the first C,

             -usvl-                    -osael-           'run'    There is an asymmetry between the cases with e and those with ο in the
perfective. With rare underived exceptions like 'gesture', e is confined to
Mediopassive derivatives with -m-. Especially in the causatives, we often get
perfective ο even when the VblN and other forms point to lexical i. Leaving
the choice between e and ο aside, the question here is how to account for the
mid-height V's in the context of ablaut mechanics.
    Synchronically, the most straightforward interpretation is that the mid-
height V's reflect a mix of Η and L features. The fact that the mid-height V is
flanked by two ae's in the trisyllabic perfectives suggests that a stem-wide <L>
melody is at hand. This would make sense if we assume a lexical high V.
    In other contexts the melodic L or Η trumps lexical vocalic features. For
example, - b v l u l w - 'gape' with medial u has PerfP -aeblalaer-, which
preserves no trace of the rounding feature. By contrast, the perfectives in (97)
combine /u/ with L to give o, and HI with L to give e. In other words, the
surface mid-height V is a compromise, and rounding and backness values are
preserved.
    For historical speculations see the end of the preceding section.","[142, 143]"

5.1.1.2          ComparativesThe most common symmetrical comparative construction, glossable as 'X be
as [adjective] as Y \ involves the transitive verb -ujdvh- (PerfP -ojdaeh-). In
the absence of a specification, this verb can mean 'be equal to' or 'be as big
as'. It can be adapted to other adjectival qualities by adding an appropriate
specification ('X equals Y [with respect to\ strength'). The specifying noun
follows the verb, with no preposition. The Resit stem -ojdaeh- is usual in
positive comparatives. Some dialects have g for T-ka j.(220)     a.        waerAdsr-l                  0-ogdeh

"(460)   Causative Initial V-Shortening (repeated from (124))            A full V in the first syllable of an underived bisyllabic

proper, it is not completely out of the question to take the underived perfective
shape -v(C)Ci/uC- as basic to both. Comparison with such cases as (PerfP =
454     8 Verbal derivationShlmpf) - a n d u - 'be churned' and its causative -s-undu- 'churn' (PerfP
-ass-unda-, etc., see (467), below) shows that a second-syllable high V in the
input can be transposed to the preceding syllable in the causative. But if 'be
churned' is analysed as having basic form -undu- to begin with, becoming
-vndu- by u-Spreading and Medial V-Shortening (before a CC cluster), cf.
§7.3.1.4, no leftward movement of the features of u would be involved, so the
comparison with causatives in (458), above, would not be instructive.
    For the record, the full set of stem forms for 'suck', the causative of 'be
sucked' (458.b), is given in (461).","[472, 473]"

3.1.2.6   Phonological status of medial [u] and [i] before CMost cases of medial [u] and [i] are unproblematically assigned to u and i
phonemes. However, there are some cases where I transcribe them as
diphthongs, ay or a w . The stems in question have ablaut alternations of the
type asw versus [u], or asy versus [i]. For example, the verb 'dust o f f has a
Shlmpf stem kaeykaey [kae'jkaej], and a PerfP stem [a'k:ikasj] that I transcribe
-akkaykasy-. Likewise Shlmpf laewlaew 'tower (above)' and PerfP [a'hulu],
the latter transcribed -allawlaw-.
     For the irregular verb 'sit' (Vrym or Vrm), the most common forms are of
the perfective stem family, e.g. PerfP [-aeq:ima-] (for T-ka, the [ae] is a backed
                                                                      3.1 Segments       41realization of /a/, harmonic to i, before a BLC, but for other dialects it is a true
initial ze). The Shlmpf is dialectally variable, e.g. Sg Imprt r a m (qam) versus
Yayam. This variation suggests competing analyses of the perfectives, as
either -aqqima- or -sqqayma- (plus variants with initial ae). The LoImpfP is
usually - t - a r a s y m a - but - t - a r a m a - is attested dialectally. See §7.3.2.9 for
more on 'sit', and on the other stem of the same type (Vjyh or Vjh 'witness').","[59, 60]"
"    It is also possible to put the possessor in subject position with transitive
verb -νΐυ- 'have' (§9.1.3, and for the irregular morphology §7.3.2.13). One
can further extract the object of this verb, e.g. as a 'what?' interrogative, the
effect being to approximate a predicate genitive ('what does X have?' = 'what
belongs to X?').

12.2.5    Focalization of verb or VPVerb (or VP) focalization occurs, for example, in response to questions of the
'what are you doing?' type. This corresponds to ""verb clefting"" in the syntax
literature. The verb (or VP) is converted into a VblN, is treated as the object of
-vji> 'do, make', and is then fronted like an ordinary focalized direct object. In
effect, -vju- takes the place of the verb in the original location. Focus
morpheme ά is usually present, but it is omitted in (752). Note that here the
complement ('suffering') remains in its original position, rather than following
the lexical verb into clause-initial focalized position. The complement cannot
be fronted along with the VblN unless it is expressed as a possessor NP, and
while this is grammatical, the construction in (752) with the complement
following -vju- is far more idiomatic and is common in texts. However, the
entire core VP, here 'see suffering', is logically focalized.

608      10 Clitics     I have also heard the 2MaSg preverbal form as -\ha-kk with geminated kk.
     The ""full"" forms are used in the following cases: a) when the dative
immediately follows an object clitic (in preverbal or postverbal position); b)
when the dative is postverbal and follows a high V {i u}. The ""preverbal""
column shows the form taken by the clitic when they immediately follow
preverbal particles Negative waer or Future ad (which is always reduced to ά
before clitics), or a focalized constituent (e.g. mi 'who?' in questions). The
-\ha- of the full form is deleted in the lSg form, and reduced to - \ h a -
elsewhere. The remaining columns show the forms in postverbal position after
a C (the h of the full form is dropped), and after α (the h is dropped and the
two α vowels contract into one).
    Instead of taking underlying /-ha-/ as the lexical form of the Dative
morpheme and having the /h/ deleted in some positions, one could
alternatively take the morpheme as /-a-/ and posit an h-Insertion rule (like
that given for directional clitics in §10.2.1.1). However, the phonological
distribution of the /h/ in the datives is extensive, including some post-
consonantal positions where an h-Insertion rule would have little motivation.
This is unlike the case with Centripetal Aadd, where a minor h-Insertion rule
seems warranted.
    Data from dialects other than T-ka (e.g. K-d R T-md) differ in the respects
indicated in (674).","[626, 627]"
"
9.6.3   Future (ad, ar, mar, mad, e)The Future particle has a form dd in clause-initial position. It is followed
(after any clitics that may be present) by a Shlmpf or (rarely) LoImpfP verb
stem. I was told by informants that there is a dialectal variant ar, but I cannot
identify the dialect(s) in question, and ad is usual in all the dialects I worked
on.
    The d of ad is dropped before any clitic, as in αΑΚί i-wat 'he will hit me'
(lSgO clitic Ahi). Perhaps a trace of the *d lingers in the geminated tt of the
3MaSgO clitic Att (postvocalic allomorph), as in aAtt awat-aer Ί will hit
him', but the geminated tt is now part of the clitic and is also heard after
V-final verb stems (§10.3.1).
    The alternation of ad and ά in the Future particle results in partial
convergence between this particle and the combination aAd consisting of a
590     9 Verb phrases and other predicationsminimal demonstrative ά and a following cliticized Comitative preposition d
(= ad). This a-\d functions as the normal jussive complementizer (§13.3). The
surface convergence of complementizer a - \ d with Fut d d is especially
thoroughgoing in that the -\d in a-\d is omitted if another clitic is present, as in
certain high-frequency adverbial clause types. Therefore both Fut ad and
complementizer a-\d appear as phonetic [ad] without a clitic and as phonetic
[a] before a clitic. Moreover, both occur clause-initially.
     However, there is a syntactic distinction between Future ad and the
combination a-\d in the way they combine with negation. The combination
Neg + Fut is expressed as Neg wzer (or a reduced allomorph) plus a distinctive
non-clause-initial Future allomorph such as m a d or e replacing ad (§9.6.4,
below). By contrast, complementizer a-\d is followed by Neg waer. In
addition, Future ad can only be followed by a Shlmpf or (much less often)
LoImpfP stem, whereas complementizer a-\d can be followed by a fuller range
of stems (including perfectives).
    In ordinary contexts, the verb stem used after Future ad is the Shlmpf, as
in (641.a). The LoImpfP is much less common, but can be used to specify an
extended time span (641.b).(641)   a.      ad        i-jal

                'fear'              -ammuttaesae-t        -ammüttaesae-t     In the Resit stems in (310.a), both lengthening (χ-pcl) and accent (χ-pcl)
are audible. In (310.b), we hear a marked accent (x-pcl), but lengthening
(χ-pcl) conspicuously fails to apply, even though the relevant V is short. This
pattern is characteristic of verbs that are basically adjectival in nature. This
confirms the need for a grammatical distinction between nonadjectival (310.a)
and adjectival (310.b). In (310.c), the marked accent is audible but lengthening
(if present) is not, since the V in question is already a full V. The surface forms
in (310.c) therefore give us no clue as to which stems belong with the
nonadjectival verbs in (310.a), and which belong with the adjectival verbs in
(310.b). Presumably those with adjectival sense, like 'be brown', belong with
(310.b), but there is no way to prove this empirically.
     In (310.d-f), we have an i in the Resit. As I analyse these forms, the i is the
result of applying χ-pcl to /a/ (after Melodic Association), where the relevant
schwa is the overt or underlying ν following the first C position of the stem.
For example, 'raise (child)' in (310.d) is -rvbbu- and 'be joyful' in (310.f) is
-hvlvylvy- in their basic lexical representation, and the first short ν is targeted
by χ-pcl, resulting in -arribba- and -ahllasylaey- after all rules have applied. In
308     7 Verbal morphology(310.g), there is already a full V in the relevant position, so χ-pcl applies
vacuously.
     In (310.e-g), because the V targeted by χ-pcl happens to be the antepenult
or earlier, this grammatical accent is overridden by Default Accentuation. In
(310.e-f) at least χ-pcl is audible in the form of the i vowel, but in (3lO.g)
there is no audible difference between the PerfP and the Resit.
     In (310.b-c), the only audible distinguishing feature of the Resit is the
accent, either because χ-pcl is suspended (adjectival verbs) or because the
targeted V in question is already full so χ-pcl has no audible effect. If suffixes
and/or clitics are added to Resit verbs of types (310.b-c), so that the
grammatical accent χ-pcl is overridden by Default Accentuation (or by an
accented directional clitic), there is again no audible difference between PerfP
and Resit.
     As detailed in §3.5.3.1, §8.5.2, and §12.1, χ-pcl is erased in Resit verbs
and Resit participles in definite relative clauses. This eliminates the
distinguishing i in (310.d-f), and the distinctive lengthening of the final-
syllable stem-vowel in (310.a). However, the erasure does not affect χ-pcl (i.e.
accent), so certain types of verbs maintain the PerfP/Reslt opposition even in
definite relative clauses, viz., the verbs in (310.a-d), provided that the accented
V is in the penult or final of the word and is not followed by an accented
directional clitic or by a suffix that forces penultimate accent.
     In light V-final stems, i.e. -VC(C)u- (V = short or full vowel, υ = full
vowel), e.g. 'go to' in (309.c) with PerfP -skka- and Resit -akkd-, the only
difference is accent when no subject suffix is added: 3MaSg PerfP 1-kka, Resit
i-kkd. However, when subject suffixes are added to light V-final verbs, the
suffix creates an environment that permits χ-pcl (in addition to χ-pcl) to
apply. Thus 3MaPl PerfP Skkae-n (with Presuffixal α-Shortening (112) and
VV-Contraction (37.d)) and Resit a k k d - n , 3FePl akkae-naet and Resit
skkd-naet, where the Resit forms have a lengthened as well as accented stem-
final ά. For all other verb types, including heavy V-final verbs and all C-final
verbs, suffixes are not a factor in ablaut. This shows that the scope of ablaut,
in the case of light V-final verbs, consists of the stem plus up to the first
suffixal C, hence all of 3MaPl /akka-aen/, and all of 3FePl /akka-nast/ except
the final ast. In §7.2.2.3, below, we will see that the same definition of domain
works for PerfN ablaut.
    In causatives, a Resit stem beginning in -s-ί... might be mistaken (by a
non-native speaker) for a LoImpfP. This is because many causative LoImpfP
forms begin in -s-ί... . However, the Resit stem will always have a low V at
least in its final syllable, while a LoImpfP stem beginning with i (i.e. with <H>
melody) will have high vowels through to the end of the stem.

7.2.2.3    Perfective Negative stem (PerfN)Negation is expressed in all aspect-mood categories by the preverb wser, which
undergoes Short-V Harmony to war when immediately followed by a high
vowel {u a i}. Both the PerfP and the Resit of positive sentences are negated
by a single form that is here labeled PerfN (Perfective Negative). For example,
both PerfP sssaen-aer Ί knew, found out', and the much more common Resit
sssdn-aev Ί know', are negated as war assen-aer Ί don't know' or Ί didn't
know'.
    Curiously, the same combination of waer plus PerfN verb that is used to
negative the PerfP or Resit is also used as a prohibitive (i.e., negative
imperative) 'don't VERB!'. There is no audible difference, even at clause
level, between the prohibitive and perfective negative readings. However,
there is an alternative prohibitive construction consisting of waer plus the
Prohibitive] stem, which belongs to the long imperfective system. See
§7.2.5.3 for both types of prohibitive.
    The PerfN is formed from the PerfP by adding a single ablaut formative
that is realized (if at all) as an e vowel. I label this e -pelf. This formative is
expressed audibly only in light stems ending in ...CaeC-, where it appears in
the second syllable. Otherwise the PerfN is homophonous to the PerfP. The
basic morphological data are given in (312).

which are light and C-final, with ae in the second syllable of the PerfP. (These
are the same verbs that express both χ-pcl and χ-pcl audibly in the Resit.)
     In (312.b), the stems are light V-final verbs, i.e. -V(C)Cu- with the length
of the first V variable. These verbs do not distinguish PerfN from PerfP in the
unsuffixed forms shown in the table, hence PerfP 1-ksa 'he ate', negated as
war i-ksa 'he did not eat'. However, these verbs do distinguish PerfN from
PerfP if one of the PI -asC or -CaeC subject suffixes, e.g. 3MaPl -aen or 3FePl
-naet, is present. This is because, for PerfN ablaut as for Resit ablaut (see
§7.2.2.2, above), the initial asC of subject suffixes is included, for with light
V-final verbs, in the scope of ablaut. For example, the 3MaPl (suffix -asn)
occurs in PerfP alhae-n 'they wept' (cf. Resit alhd-n), which is negated as war
slhe-n, while the 3FePl (suffix -naet) has PerfP alhas-naet, negated as war
Mhe-nast. See the full paradigm of the PerfN for the similar verb -ojja- 'weep'

suffixes are not within the scope of ablaut.
    In (312.c), the verb is too heavy to be affected by e - p c l f . In (312.d), the
PerfP does not end in ...CaeC-. Causative -aes-saer- 'depilate' looks as though it
ought to be amenable to e - p c l f , but it is syncopated from -...s-vsvr- and
therefore counts as heavy rather than light.
    In summary, the effect of e - p c l f is to insert e replacing a short ae of the
PerfP, when this is the first postconsonantal V and is also the final V.
    (313) shows that a clitic may intervene between Neg waer and the PerfN
verb.(313)     a.      waer-\t£en         i-jrew                      ^-sni ?

7.2.3     Short imperfective systemThe Shlmpf stem is closely related morphologically to the Imprt (used in
positive imperatives) stem. There is a short hortative form based on the Shlmpf
stem. I discuss the inflected Shlmpf and Imprt stems, and the short hortative
forms, in this section before turning to the long imperfective system.
    Stative aspect with present time reference is normally expressed by the
Resit stem in the perfective system. Therefore ""imperfective"" is used here for a
more limited temporal/aspectual range than in other languages where
imperfective stems are required with present time reference.","[325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]"
"
3.1.2.4   Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (in verbs)A number of verbs have stem-alternations involving full V's, short V's, and
zero. These are the only unaugmented V-final verbs. For example, 'vomit' has
a PerfP -absa-, with 3FePl subject absas-naet 'they-Fe vomited'; I take its basic
lexical form to be -vbsu-. The Shlmpf is -zebs (e.g. Sg Imprt aebs 'vomit!')
without the final V. The Shlmpf combines with 3FePl subject suffix -naet as
absa-naet, with a stem-final a that also induces an assimilatory (i.e. harmonic)
change of stem-initial /ae/ to a. It also combines with 3MaPl subject suffix -aen
to give sbsa-n. I take the basic (lexical) form of the Shlmpf to be /-aebsi-/,
ending in an underspecified high V ""i"" that is deleted without trace word-
finally (i.e. where no subject suffix appears). The hi contracts with the /ae/ of a
38   3 Phonologyfollowing V-initial subject suffix to form 3, in effect transferring its [+high]
feature to the surviving short V. The hi surfaces as a before C-initial subject
suffixes like 3FeSg -naet.
      A good case can be made for a parallel underspecified and deletable low V
that I write IAI. This occurs only in long imperfectives of a subset (namely,
bisyllablic -vCCu-) of the same V-final verbs that have h i in the short
imperfective (preceding paragraph). The LoImpfP in question appears as
- P d Q Q word-finally (i.e., with no subject suffix), as in -bass 'vomit'.
However, when a C-initial subject suffix is added, we get forms like 3FePl
bassas-nast with a stem-final low V, and this is the main evidence for a
representation of the type /-bdssA-/. When a subject suffix beginning in as is
added, we get forms like 3MaPl bdssae-n, which could be generated with or
without a stem-final /A/, but which I take (by parallelism to the short
imperfectives) as due to contraction, i.e. /bassA-asn/ with the IAI transferring
its [-high] feature to the surviving contracted V. In sum, the evidence for IAI is
weaker than that for hi, and IAI occurs in the paradigms of a subset of the
stems that have hi.
      For more on these unaugmented V-final verbs see §7.3.1.3.
      Both final hi and IAI in these verbs correspond to ""u"" in the corresponding
forms of Niger Tamajak (LTF2 424, class I.A.7-ll,e.g. Imprt ""zeknu"" and
LoImpfP ""ikannu"" for 'do well'). However, Foucauld's data do not have a
final V in such forms as ""iläss"" for 'he dresses' (DTF 4.2020) and ""ed iken""
for 'he will do well' (DTF 2.821).
      Synchronically in Tamashek, one might equate stem-final hi with a, and
IAI with ae, noting that {a ae} do not otherwise occur as stem-final segments.
However, these equations are not transparent, and the fact that the verbs in
question have stem-final full V's in the perfective and long imperfective stems
makes it difficult to justify short-vowel representations for hi and IAI. No
other stems or words in the language end with short V's.
      If we were to identify hi and IAJ with full V's (the only V's that otherwise
occur in stem-final position), hi should probably be identified with i rather
than with u. This is because there are some verb classes with a non-deleting
final u, either in the imperfective forms only or in both perfective and
imperfective stems. For example, the verb 'cough' appears as -asu- in both
PerfP and Shlmpf stems (§7.3.1.4). This u does not delete word-finally, and
contracts with /ae/ at the beginning of a subject suffix to form u rather than a,
as in asu-n 'they-Ma coughed' from /asu-aen/. This true stem-final u therefore
has no phonological similarity to III. However, there is only one verb with true
i in the Shlmprt stem, namely -Iwi- 'be born'. Since this verb has a /-iCi-/
shape not found with any of the verbs that I analyse as having final hi in the
Shlmpf (and IAI in the LoImpfP), one could imagine identifying III with i and
trying to connect the phonological differences in some way with stem shape.
However, again this is a somewhat convoluted argument, and I prefer to think
of hi and IAJ as abstract segments with vowel-like properties.
      The deletion rule may be formulated as (29).
                                                             3.1 Segments     39(29)      Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (Verbs)              Stem-final underspecified vowels I I I (high) and /A/ (low) are
              deleted when not followed by a nonzero subject suffix    The nonzero suffixes expressing imperative subject (MaPl -aet, FePl -maet)
do not count as ""subject suffixes"" for this purpose and do not block the
deletion (§7.2.3.2).
    When deletion of hi produces a word-final CC cluster, depending on
which C's are involved it may be necessary to resyllabify by inserting a schwa
between the two. In T-ka this also entails an accent shift onto the schwa. See
§3.2.4 and §3.3.2 for details.","[56, 57, 58]"
"     The sense is deciphered by noting which case (object or dative) the non-1st
person clitic is in, then inferring the grammatical function of the ambiguous 1st
person clitic. In (685.a), the final -\tt is a 3Sg object form, so the ambiguous
lSg Λα-hi- is interpreted as a dative. In (685.b), the final -\ha-s is a 3Sg
dative, so the ambiguous lSg Λα-hi- is interpreted as an object pronominal. In
both types, informants normally reject suggested alternatives with the lSg
clitic following the non-lst person clitic. Thus #i-waet-\t-\ha-hi for (685.a) and
#i-wast-\a-s-\ha-hi for (685.b) were usually expressly rejected, though very
rarely such a combination did occur in paradigmatic elicitation.
     However, in some combinations it is possible for a 1st person dative clitic
to follow a 3rd person object clitic. Consider (686), attested in T-md and K-d.
                                                  10.4 Ordering of clitics   613(686)   i-qre-\n-\ha-hi
        3MaSgS-kill.PerfP-\3MaP10-\Dat-lSg
        'He killed them-Ma for me.' (T-md)     Here the 3MaPl object has a reduced, arguably V-initial allomorph (/-aen-/)
after the V-final verb (-sgra-), and we get VV-Contraction with /a-ae/
surfacing as e. It appears that this ""fusion"" of object clitic with stem-final V
permits an exception to the first person first rule. However, even here, some
speakers including my primary T-ka informant strongly prefer to allow the first
person first rule to apply, so instead of (686) they have i-qYCi-\0-hi-\taen, with
3MaP10 -\taen at the end.
     In the combinations not involving a 1st person clitic, the common
sequence is dative-object. In other words, the object-2 slot is favored for
object clitics. One can account for the data by recognizing (684.b) as the basic
order, while allowing for subsequent ""fronting"" of a lSg or 1P1 form to initial
position within the clitic cluster. However, there are also some attestations of
object-dative order even when a 1st person clitic is not involved, so the
ordering is not rigid.
     In the uncommon case where two objects and one dative co-occur, the two
object clitics flank the dative clitic, so we get object-dative-object order.
     Some further examples each involving one dative clitic and one object
clitic are in (687). The verb glossed 'kill' can also mean 'hit hard, whack'.
(687.a-b) include a 1st person, while the others do not.(687)   a.      waer-\hl-\tt                   i-ηγα

accentuation in this position, may have ""comma"" intonation, and is essentially
external to the clause. If the referent in question is subject, object, etc., it is
expressed by a pronominal in the clause proper. In (689.a-b), the topicalized

"    Further kin terms of this regular type are ae-bdbas 'cross-cousin', a-jaeya
'great grandson', a-daeggal 'father- or son-in-law', and α-laggas 'brother-in-
law'. This is also the pattern for ""kin"" terms that are just special uses of
ordinary nouns in possessed form (e.g. 'child', 'man', 'woman').
                                          5.2 Possession and compounding     261     A handful of kin terms take a special set of pronominal possessive suffixes
given in (251), below. Since these nouns are a subset of the (semantically)
inalienable nouns in the language, for lack of a better term I call these suffixes
inalienable. The stems in question are V-final, so there is only one suffixal
series. All of the suffixes are distinct from their counterparts in the regular
possessive series (§5.2.2, just above). The Ο before some suffixes indicates
that the suffix forces penultimate word accent.
     The postconsonantal allomorphs for singular possessors are difficult to
elicit. The inalienable noun stems that end in a C are plural: taey- 'fathers
(of...)' and maessaw- 'owners/masters (of...)', and they normally require
plural possessors, as in täey-naer 'our fathers' and maessaw-kmaet 'your-FePl
masters'. In Tuareg society, one does not easily speak of the 'fathers' or
'masters' of a single person or object. In the case of 'father', the synonym
abba (250) can be used in its plural form (with alienable possessor suffix).
When pressed to combine Sg possessor suffixes with taey- or maessaw-,
informants grudgingly add -(e)v, -k, -m, and -s with no phonological difficulty
but find the combinations awkward. With maessaw- 'owners', I recorded lSg
maessaw-r (T-ka), maessaw-ex (R), and maessaw-i (A-grm).","[279, 280]"
"    YQS after one clause, followed closely by another clause, can indicate
temporal proximity of the two events (§13.1.1.4).
    The alternative construction involves a negated clause, followed by an
add-on phrase (small clause) with ar 'except' and the highlighted constituent.
(For a version with ssel instead of ar, see §11.3.2, below.) This ar is a particle
rather than a true preposition and does not induce Prefix Reduction on a

followed by ar and a VblN specifying the concrete event type. Note that
although t-e-taete is the logical subject of 'occupy', the latter has default
3MaSg subject rather than 3FeSg agreement, and t-e-taete does not show
Prefix Reduction as it would if it were a true syntactic subject.
    In (700.b), ar is followed by a complete clause, if dd here is the Future
particle.
    In R dialect, ar is also a particle meaning 'until' or 'all the way to', but in
T-ka and other dialects the 'until' particle is har (§13.1.1.5).
11.3.2 'other than'(ssel)The particle sael occurs in a construction of the type '(an) X other than Y'
where X is a noun (normally indefinite in sense) and Y is an NP with more
specific reference. If X is not expressed by a regular noun, the minimal
demonstrative ά can be used, sael is not a preposition, and a following noun
does not undergo Prefix Reduction.(701)   a.       daer      ae-kall       sael       [w-α               naesasn]

specifies that what he eats is not limited to meat.
     ssel also occurs in the fixed temporal phrase d-sal wen sael a-sskka 'the
day after tomorrow', lit. 'that day there other than tomorrow'.
     ssel can occur in constructions of the type 'not..., except X' (i.e. 'only X'),

basic sense is 'also, in addition', with 'again' as a more contextual translation.

§11.3.5, below, and (795) in §13.1.1.4. For har 'until' see §13.1.1.5.(704)   har            w-ά               i-rhln

11.3.5 'not yet' (har w-ά, saedder, and!)There are two basic constructions for 'not yet'. The first is of the syntactic type
'not still', involving negation and har w-ά 'still' (see just above). The har w-ά
may be clause-initial or -final (705.a-b). The second construction also involves
a negation, but uses sasdder (dialectally saedden) '(not) yet' clause-finally
(705.c). The variation between saedder and saedden resembles that between
negative predicator wasdder and wasdden (633) (§9.5), though the dialectal
range of the rare variant ssedden is much more limited than than for the variant
wsedden.(705)   a.      wser-\d           0-osa                     har     w-ά

variants with α rather than a in the final syllable, like a-mlawlaw, since this
change does not affect accent.)
     In (93.b), we have apparent final-syllable accent, but this is due to deletion
of a stem-final V, compare LoImpfP -t-lmtalli- and PerfP -aemtaella-. If we
order the association of χ-pen to the stem before Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29),
the form will come out correctly.
     (93.c) shows that augment verbs, i.e. verbs that take Augment -t in most
inflected forms, do not have χ-pen in the VblN, even though the Augment is
not part of the VblN (or any other nominal).
                                                             3.4 Ablaut         1213.4.6   From <H L> to pure <L> melody (PerfP verbs)In §3.4.3.2, above, we saw that while a great many verbs have <H L> melody
in perfectives, another large set of verbs has a stem-wide <L> perfective
melody. The issue to be discussed here is whether the <L> melody can be
reduced to <H L>. Since the stems in question have at least two syllables, and
usually three or more, there is no obvious reason why the Η component of
<H L> should be unable to associate audibly with at least the stem-initial
syllable. However, the <H> melody is in a one-to-one relationship (in T-ka and
other dialects, except A-grm). Given this correlation, the possibility of a
phonological motivation for the <H> perfective melody should be considered.
    I will exclude from this discussion the unusual perfectives of adjectival
verbs. These adjectival perfectives are typically C-initial (§7.3.1.11), but
nonetheless fail to accept subject prefixes, including 3MaSg i-. Many of these
adjectival perfectives have stem-wide (usually bisyllabic) <H> vocalism, but
others have <L> vocalism. The perfective stems of these adjectival verbs often
diverge sharply in shape from imperfectives, and generally behave as
lexicalized, idiosyncratic perfective stems. I choose not to decompose them
into ablaut components.
    With the adjectival stems excluded, we turn to examples like those in (94).","[139, 140]"

3.5.1   Prefix Reduction of nouns (dependent state)An important morphological process affecting nouns is that associated with
dependent state (in French usually « etat d'annexion »). This ""state"" is a
cover term for the following syntactic positions: a) complement of a
preposition (dative, possessive, locative), b) compound final (in a few tight
compound constructions like that with erk 'bad', §5.2.4.4); and c) subject
immediately following an inflected verb. In all three cases, the noun in
question can be said to ""depend on"" an immediately preceding word or stem.
    If a noun that has a vocalic prefix consisting of a full V (i.e. a noun
beginning with Sg α-, e-, t-α-, t-e-, or PI i- or t-i-) occurs in dependent state,
directly following the preposition, compound initial, or verb on which it
""depends,"" the prefix undergoes Prefix Reduction. There is no other
morphological indication of dependent state (for example, there is no case-
marking of subject or prepositional complement), so Prefix-Reduction itself is
as close as we come in this language to structural case-marking. Note that
nouns that do not have a full-V prefix undergo no (audible) reduction of the
prefix.
     I use the diacritic 1 before a noun to indicate that it has undergone audible
Prefix Reduction. I do not use the diacritic for other nouns (e.g. those lacking a
full-V vocalic prefix), even when they occur in syntactic positions associated
with dependent state.
    The relevant shifts are given in (125).",[166]

3.2.1.2    Nasal assimilation and dissimilationIn most dialects, /n/ appears as [m] before a labial stop { b p } , and as velar or
uvular [q] before stops {g k Y}. In the cluster η γ , the γ is pronounced as
uvular stop or affricate (§3.1.1.3). Observable alternations occur primarily in
verbs whose first C is a nasal. Two examples: 1) PerfP -smbasr- '(herd) be
taken to pasture at night' and variant VblN t - a - m b s r - t versus LoImpfP
-ndbbaer- and VblN a-naebar ; 2) PerfP -3ητα- 'kill' versus LoImpfP -naqq-
and VblN t-e-naeYe. The most obvious analysis for these cases is that the /n/ is
basic but undergoes point-of-articulation assimilation to an immediately
following C.
     One could alternatively argue that an initial /m/ or /q/ shifts to n stem-
initially. This is dubious for /q/ since the velar nasal is a marginal phoneme in
prevocalic position (§3.1.1.2). However, this analysis is fairly credible for /m/,
since /m/ in verb prefixes (there is no /m/ in nominal prefixes) shifts to n when
the stem contains a labial. The prefixes in question are Mediopassive (§8.3)
and Agentive (§8.8). By extending this dissimilation to e.g. -nabbaer-
(preceding paragraph), one could actually argue for a basic lexical
representation with /m/ instead of /n/.
     On the whole, I prefer the nasal-assimilation analysis, since it makes more
sense for the alternations of n with q.",[64]

respect Sibilant Harmony. All causatives that are in common use respect
harmony (in T-ka). Harmony seems to be less reliable in R and A-grm, though
this comment is based on elicited examples. I recorded P e r f P
-aes-raerzaezzaew- and later -aez-vaerzaszzaew- from the R speaker for 'fell
(tree)'. Another R form is PerfP -aes-kaerzaszzaew- 'cluck (tongue)'. A-grm
PerfP -s-aeffaenasssae-t 'break (melon) open with hand' is another non-
harmonic example.
    For -vnsu- 'be sold (or bought)', the causative is -s-vnso- for R and T-ka
but -z-vnsu- for other dialects (A-grm I K-d). Here we get positional but not
voicing harmony. The causative is much more common than the intransitive;
with different directional clitics it is the basic verb for 'buy', 'sell', and
'barter'.
    A-grm causative -s-vzvd- and K-d unsegmentable - s v z z v d - 'prostrate
oneself (in prayer' are borrowed from Classical Arabic root Vsjd (j is
pronounced ζ in Hassaniya Arabic). T-ka causative -s-vjvd- (same gloss) does
not violate Sibilant Harmony.
    The simple verb 'laugh' has C's d...z when separated by a V, but ts
varying with ts when clustered, e.g. PerfP -stsa- (-atsa-) and LoImpfP -ddzz-.
In the causative, the C's in question are always clustered. There is a (faint)
possibility of deriving ts from underlying /dz/, and if native speakers agreed
we could, in theory, have -z- as Causative prefix. In fact, we get -s- (e.g. PerfP
-sss-atsa-), showing that native speakers take the stem-internal sibilant to be s
(or possibly s) instead of z.","[461, 462]"

2.3 Prefix ReductionIt was mentioned above that nouns express (local) dependency on a preceding
element by undergoing Prefix Reduction. This applies to a subject (but not
object) noun after a verb, to a noun functioning as complement of a
preposition, and to a noun stem functioning as a compound final.
     Most nouns have a vocalic prefix -i- in the plural. This PI prefix is audibly
reduced to -9- or zero in the relevant syntactic positions. These same nouns
have a vocalic prefix -α-, -e-, -as-, or -a- in the singular. Of these Sg prefixes,
-ae- and -a- are already short vowels and cannot be audibly reduced. However,
-a- and -e- are reduced to a short vowel, either -a- or -ae- depending on dialect
and on the height of the vowel of the following syllable. Nouns that do not
have a segmentable vocalic prefix are unaffected by Prefix Reduction.
     The position of the accent is unaffected by Prefix Reduction. In particular,
if the vocalic prefix happens to be accented, its reduced variant (other than
zero) continues to bear accent. In cases where PI vocalic prefix -i- is reduced
to zero, the accent shifts to the preceding syllable (i.e. to the final syllable of
the preceding word). Thus t-Vhatt-en 'sheep-Pi' occurs in the locative PP dasr
""t-3-hatt-en 'in the sheep', with a dialectal variant (e.g. K-d) dser ""t-^-hatt-en.
     Where Prefix Reduction has applied audibly, the symbol Ί is given at the
beginning of the word in question. Thus e-haen 'house' has a reduced form
""ae-hasn.",[33]
"            3. Agentive
                  [no examples; the two -uPQu- stems are non-agentive

                   -t-ilaw 'is spacious'
                         (cf. 3MaPl i-t-ilw-aen)    The only verbs of shape -uPQu- with two full V's, where Q is a sonorant,
are (PerfP) -olwa- 'be spacious' and -odwa- 'leave in afternoon'. The only
respect in which they differ from the -vPQu- verbs is insofar as their long
imperfectives are also subject to resyllabification.
    I know of one underived (and unaugmented) -CvPQu- verb of the same
type, namely -lvjwu- 'bend, veer' (PerfP -allajwa-, LoImpfP -t-alaejwa-, but
Imprt laejaew from /laejwi/ and VbIN a-bjsww from /-lsjwi/.
    This leaves -vPQu- verbs as the overwhelmingly most common stems
subject to resyllabification. The following stems are affected (they are shown
in the resyllabified Sg Imprt, for underlying /asPQi/): s r a r [asras'r] 'read!' or
'call!', sjal 'go!', akan 'do (well)!', skal 'spend mid-day!', asal 'hear!', and
64    3 Phonology 3S3W 'drink!'. A larger set of -vPQu- stems end in stable CC clusters in the Sg
 Imprt and so do not undergo resyllabification: (Imprt) aebs 'vomit!', aetf 'be
 poured!' (Vdf), sets 'laugh' (Vdz), aert 'be implanted!', aeks 'sprout!', aels 'get
dressed!', aelz 'shave!', aend 'collapse!', aeijY 'kill!', aens 'lie down!', sens 'be
 sold!' or 'excuse!', zent 'begin!', aerv 'be on fire!', aerh 'want!', and aerz
 'break!'. Note that these all involve an obstruent or h as final C. I know of no
 -vPQu- stems where Ρ and Q are both sonorants and do not form a geminate.
There is no resyllabification when the cluster is geminate, even when it is a
 sonorant: aekk 'go (to)', aezz 'weave!', aenn 'say!'. In the one case involving h
preceding a sonorant, the necessity for resyllabification is avoided, since the
two C's are metathesized (§3.2.2.1) when not separated by a V: 'weep'
(LoImpfP -hall- with Vhl, but PerfP -alha- and Imprt aelh with Vlh).
     Resyllabification is blocked in most cases when the verb form in question
 is followed by a V-initial suffix or clitic. This is regularly the case with
 inflected verbs (including imperatives). Thus 2Sg Imprt assl 'hear!' but 2MaPl
Imprt aesl-aet, the latter having the same shape as the 2MaPl forms of non-
resyllabifying verbs, e.g. äebs-set 'vomit!-MaPl'. For the agentives and VblN's,
resyllabification is likewise blocked when a PI suffix (MaPl -aen, here realized
 as -an) is added; see the plurals given in parentheses in (43). However, in the
T-ka VblN (and certain minor nominals) that show Stem-Final Gemination, the
geminate is retained when possessive suffixes are added, hence a-s-akann
 'showing', a-s-akann-in 'my showing' (not #a-s-3kn-in as wel might expect
on the basis of unpossessed PI i-s-akn-an).
     In the case of Vsw 'drink' and its derivatives, the only set where the final
 C is w, the resyllabified form -ssaw is pronounced [-asu1] and can be treated
 as V-final at least for purposes of assigning allomorphs (postvocalic versus
 postconsonantal) to a following clitic. Thus Imprt 3saw-\tt occurs dialectally
 as an alternative to aesw-\e 'drink it-MaSg!'. The latter variant shows the
 pattern that is obligatory in other resyllabifying verbs, e.g. aevr-\e 'read it!'.
      However, in the more easterly dialects, the number of forms subject to
Stem-Final i/A-Deletion is diminished, which of course limits the scope of
resyllabification. For example, the high-frequency motion verb -vjlu- (eastern
 -vglu-) 'go' has short imperfectives that undergo Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29)
 in a few dialects (A-grm T-ka T-md), but not elsewhere (Gao K-d K-f Ts), e.g.
T-ka Sg Imprt ejal 'go!' versus K-d aglu. Likewise, the long imperfectives of
verbs like -ulwu- 'be spacious' show Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29) in some
dialects (K-d R T-ka) but keep the stem-final V in others (A-grm Gao R), e.g
T-ka 3MaSg LoImpfP i-t-ilsw versus Gao i-t-llwa.
     The most systematic dialectal difference is in the VblN's of prefixally
derived stems. For example, T-ka α-s-ilaww 'making spacious' (PI
l-s-alw-αη) corresponds to A-grm a-s-alwi, and T-ka a-s-akann 'showing' (PI
l-s-skn-an) corresponds to A-grm a-s-akni (PI i-s-akni-taen).
     On occasion I have recorded Imprt and Shlmpf verb forms ending in
Augment -t, although the verb in question is not otherwise of the augment
class. This tends to happen in elicitation of paradigms of less common heavy
                          3.2 Local assimilations and syllabification rules    65verbs. Example: for the T-md informant, 'become long (or tall)' was recorded
as PerfP sajra-, Imprt sljra-t, and LoImpfP -t-lsajru-. The Imprt form here also
shows the i...a vocalism typical of the imperfective of adjectival verbs. This
verb shows up in other dialects either as an augmented verb (PerfP -assagrae-t
in A-grm, for example), or as an unaugmented verb with final stem consonant t
(PerfP sajrat- in several dialects); see §7.3.2.2. The T-md speaker appears to
have made selective, opportunistic use of the augment option to avoid having
to resyllabify the Imprt stem.
     The formulation of the Final-CC Schwa-Insertion rule is tricky, since the
epenthetic V appears as a in most cases, e.g. alaw 'be spacious!', but appears
as ae in m-aesaew 'be drunk!' and e-m-aesaeww 'drinker; water source'. In three
morphological patterns we get a. One is the VblN type for derived or long
underived verbs, where the entire stem is subject to a <H> vocalic melody, so
schwa is the expected short V: α-m-asaww 'being drunk', α-s-ilaww 'making
spacious'. A second is the set of imperfectives like (Caus) Imprt s-ilaw 'make
spacious!' and Lolmpf -t-ilaw 'is spacious', where we again assume a stem-
wide <H> melody (underlying /s-ilwi/, /-t-ilwi/). The third is the underived
short imperfective of type Imprt ajal 'go!' and alaw 'be spacious!', where the
epenthetic schwa breaks up a CC cluster that separates underlying <L> and
<H> melodic components (/acjli/, /alwi/). Here it is not clear whether the
schwa is determined by the <H> melodic component, or is simply the default
epenthetic vowel.
     This leaves mediopassive Imprt m-aesasw 'be drunk!' and e-m-aesaeww
'drinker; water source', from -vswu- 'drink'. For m-aesaew, the basic form is
arguably / m - a e s w A / instead of / m - a e s w i / , since mediopassive short
imperfectives favor <L> melody. In the case of e-m-aesaeww 'drinker; water
source', in the agentive interpretation 'drinker' we would probably expect a
composite <H L> melody; compare e-m-aeks 'eater', feminine counterpart
t-e-m-aeksi-t-t with stem-final i. I know of one other agentive of this type,
e-m-aeraerr 'reader, pupil' from - v r r u - 'read', e-m-aesaeww in the sense
'water source' is a nonagentive nominal and might have a stem-wide <L>
melody, but agentives e-m-asvaerr and e-m-assaeww presumably have <L H>
melody like other agentives of -vCCi> stems. Given that Imprt /aeswi/ and
/aerri/ appear as asaw (or a s u ) and a r a r , while agentives /e-m-aeswi/ and
/e-m-aerri/ appear as e-m-aesaeww and e-m-aeraerr, it is necessary to explain
why the L part of the <L H> melody extends to the epenthetic V in the
agentives but not in the Imprt. Pending further dialectological study, it is far
from clear that Stem-Final Gemination (which is limited to T-ka nominals,
including VblN's and agentives) is correlated with this difference in melodic
domain. For now I will simply stipulate the difference as a morpho-
phonological fact (45).
66      3 Phonology(44)      Final-CC Schwa-Insertion             Word-finally (or before suffix or clitic beginning with a C), a
             sequence ...VPQ where V is any vowel, Ρ and Q are distinct C's,
             and Q is a sonorant (semivowel, liquid, nasal), insert a between Ρ
             and Q.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"
"    Except as noted below ('drink'), resyllabification does not apply when the
verb stem in question is followed by a V-initial suffix or clitic. This cannot be
explained as Syncope applying to a previously resyllabified sequence, since
there is no evidence for Stem-Final Gemination in the relevant suffixal
combinations, and since Short-V Harmony (§3.2.6) does not affect the first
syllable in Imprt or other verbs. Thus for - v r r u - 'read', T-ka Imprt /asm/—»
/aerr/ —> a r a r 'read!' without further suffix or clitic, but serr-\e 'read it!' with
V-initial 3MaSg object clitic.
    However, in the specific case of -vswu- 'drink', the resyllabified variant
-3S3W occurs (in several dialects) before the 3MaSg object clitic, which
therefore takes its postvocalic allomorph -\tt. Probably -asaw [ssu:1] has been
reanalysed as -ssu, resulting in this (dialectal) generalization. For Sg Imprt
'drink it-Ma!' we therefore get, depending on the dialect, two results. The first
type is seen in A-grm aeswAi and T-ka aeswAe, parallel to aevrAe 'read it!' and
2eks-\e 'eat it!'. Here -\e (including A-grm variant -\i) is the postconsonantal
allomorph of the 3MaSgO object clitic. The second type is seen in asüAtt (K-d
K-f R Ts) and asiiAtti (Im), where the clitic has a postvocalic allomorph.",[85]

     In (385.a), 'be licit' and 'be illicit' refer to Islamic law and, and the word
families in question are borrowed from Arabic. The other verbs in (385) appear
to be native Berber terms.
     There are many terms denoting shades of color associated prototypically
with particular animals, particularly in the red/brown and grey regions.
Therefore glosses like 'be brown' and 'be grey' may appear in this grammar
for multiple items.

perfective melody (at least in T-ka), are given in (386). Again, the term

but also over word boundaries (§3.2.1.1).
     Within words, we have cases of morphological gemination such as
/i-avmbb-aet/ >l-qqubb-aet 'he gulped', cf. verbal noun a - r a b b u 'gulping'.
At a nonprefixal morpheme boundary (with a suffix or clitic), q q often
represents Μ or IrkJ, as when a morpheme otherwise ending in γ is followed
by a morpheme otherwise consisting of or beginning in t or k (e.g. FeSg -t,
3MaPl object clitic -t, or any of the pronominal clitics beginning in k). An
example is the name of the language, / t - a 2 - m d : s a e v - t / > t-£e-ma:saeq-q
'Tamashek'; see §3.2.1.1 for more detail. In these cases, the effect is a
bidirectional feature assimilation whereby the t or k adopts the uvular position
of the Y while the latter adopts a voiceless stop articulation.
     At word boundaries, we have such examples as preposition dser 'in' plus
any noun beginning in Y, e.g. DA2Y Yussast 'in August', often pronounced
[dajqiu'J'iaet]. Another recurring combination is a verb ending in lSgS -3ΪΥ
followed by particle Yds 'only'.
     While /YY/ is regularly realized as qq, there are hints that ungeminated q
may be on the way to becoming a phoneme distinct from Y. This is because q
as well as γ can occur in ungeminated position. While γ is much more
common, there are some cases of q in Arabic borrowings, as in PerfP -aqbael-
'consent' (imperative aqbal, LoImpfP -qdbbael-, cf. noun aelqabdla, all from
Arabic qbl 'accept'). Contrast this with a native stem like -SYbaer- 'kick with
heel' (Imprt 3Ybsr, LoImpfP -Yabbaer-). There are also dialectally sporadic
cases of ungeminated q in non-borrowed vocabulary, especially where back-
26    3    Phonologyformation from geminated qq may be involved. An example of internal back-
formation is the verb 'sit' (§7.3.2.9), which often appears in the perfective or
resultative stem, which involve gemination to q q (PerfP - a j q q i m a - , etc.). For
some speakers we also (by back-formation) get ungeminated q rather than γ in
forms like Imprt q a y a m (variant q a m ) alongside r a y m , where I interpret the
variants with q as influenced by the qq of the perfectives.
    In the combination η γ , often representing alveolar η plus Y, the γ
approaches the stop articulation [q], or an affricated articulation that sounds
like phonetic [q Y ]. The most common case is the verb 'kill', P e r f P -aqYa-
[-sqq^a-], but e.g. VblN t-e-naeYe with intervening vowel. I do not use "" q ""
here in phonemic transcriptions, since I am not convinced that the segment in
question is completely voiceless in this position; an instrumental phonetic
study would be useful. N o similar affrication occurs in m r , e.g. i - n w a d
'vassals' (PI of a-m3Yid).
    While there is incipient phonemic splitting of q and Y, the alternation of
ungeminated γ and geminated q q remains quite fundamental. For purposes of
alphabetizing dictionary entries, I treat q as though γ (i.e. immediately
following g).","[44, 45]"

                                       [LoImpfP also -s-aPaeCCa-]     There are some minor differences between causatives and other stems. In
causatives, the tendency of stems with i to have <L> LoImpfP extends to
superheavy stems, and V-final stems tend to have final u rather than i in the
LoImpfP (in the absence of a medial full V).
     The comparisons between Shlmpf and LoImpfP above are also useful in
another connection, namely, specifying the precise input to long imperfective
ablaut. When the -t- prefix is present, if the core stem is C-initial it is
necessary to account for the vowel that appears between the two. In the
LoImpfP, this V is targeted by χ-pcl and χ-pcl (i.e. length and accent), and so
appears as ί or ά, but the corresponding LoImpfN always has 3, and the Prohib
(which respects the verb's characteristic long imperfective melody) has a or as.
So disregarding the special LoImpfP ablaut formatives we need to ensure that
a short vowel (""v"") occurs between -t- and the stem-initial C before ablaut
(including vocalic melodies) takes place. One possibility is to argue that -t- is
really -tv-. However, we have also identified a Stem-Initial V-Insertion that
adds an initial short V to the perfectives and Shlmpf (but not Imprt) of many
verbs, and having a version of this rule apply to a C-initial stem as an input
modification prior to applying long imperfective ablaut components is another
possibility.
     More serious pre-ablaut reconfigurations may be needed for the light
verbs in (332), which have a vowel between C, (""P"") and C2 (""Q"") in the long
imperfectives but not in the perfectives or short imperfectives.

    P r e - a b l a u t r e c o n f i g u r a t i o n s are a s o m e w h a t questionable
morphophonological concept. The need to include such modifications to
support an otherwise ""regular"" componential ablaut analysis should make us
wonder whether long imperfectives of light stems might have template-like
features. Certainly there is no overall prosodic template that could begin to
capture the full range of long imperfective shapes, and the long imperfectives
of heavy verbs are transparently constructed by applying ablaut components to
the basic form of the stem, preserving the stem's C and V positions. However,
several types of light verb end up with long imperfectives based on a shape
beginning -CvCC... (hence LoImpfP -CdCC...), and a templatic element in
derivations is not out of the question.","[347, 348, 349]"
"     Some singular nouns already begin in a short vowel ae or a, whether it is
segmentable as a prefix or part of the stem. MaSg examples: addinaet 'people'
(dialectally seddinaet), ae-lawi 'cockiness'. Such nouns undergo no further
reduction after prepositions or in postverbal subject function. The same is true
of FeSg nouns with t- plus a short vowel, e.g. t-a-rlali-t-t 'women's cry of
joy'. Likewise, the few C-initial nouns that do not take nominal prefixes (e.g.
ksemmo 'illness') undergo no change in the syntactic positions indicated. For
all of these invariant nouns, there is no audible difference between e.g. subject
and object directly following a verb stem.
     However, the majority of nouns do begin with a full-V prefix (with or
without FeSg t-). These undergo Prefix Reduction in the relevant positions:
MaSg α-kaebor 'sparrow', dependent ""ae-kaebor, MaPl ί-kbar, dependent
""a-kbar ; FeSg t-a-käebar-t, dependent ""t-se-kaebar-t, FePl t - l - k a b r - e n ,
dependent ""t-s-kabr-en varying dialectally with 't-0-kabr-en (with phrasal
accent on the preceding morpheme x).
     The choice between ""a- and nas- here is consistent with an initial reduction
to ""ae-, which is then subject (most systematically in T-ka) to Short-V
Harmony (46) (§3.2.6), which converts /ae/ to a when the following syllable
has a high V. In dialects like A-grm that do not apply Short-V Harmony, we
get ""ae- as the reduced form of Ί α- or 'e- regardless of the vocalism of the
following syllable.
     The choice between ""a- and zero (-0-) in the plural is somewhat tricky. In
all dialects, we get a phonetic schwa when the following stem begins with a
CC cluster, as in i-hrühuv-asn 'migrations', reduced form ""a-hrühur-aen. In
T-ka and some Gao-area dialects, if the stem proper begins with CV..., we get
""0- in the MaPl (for i-), but ""t-a- with a clear schwa in the FePl (for t-i-). In
                     3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes    149T-md, R, K, and some Gao-area dialects, we get ""0- in the MaPl (for i-) as in
T-ka, but also get 't-0- in the FePl. The dialectal difference can be seen in the
PP formed by Locative daer 'in' and the PI noun t-l-rubba 'gulps', which
appears as T-ka daer ""t-a-vubba but e.g. T-md d s r ""t-0-Yubba. Note the
accents; the T-ka schwa is capable of taking accent (here, default accent on the
antepenult), but the T-md zero is disregarded in accentuation, so phrasal accent
falls on the preceding preposition. A further example is t-l-hatt-en 'sheep-PI',
daer t-3-hatt-en 'in the sheep' (T-ka, some Gao-area dialects) or dser
t-0-hatt-en (K, other Gao-area dialects).
     There is a real question whether the basic Prefix Reduction rule converts
PI i- to V (which can then be syncopated in some environments), or to 0 -
(with a schwa inserted by a later rule if too many C's have piled up). Within
T-ka, MaPl i- seems to have a basic reduced form '0-, but FePl t-i- has a basic
reduced form """"t-a-. so the MaPl and FePl diverge in vocalism. In T-md and
other dialects that allow FePl t-0-, it is reasonable to take ^0- as the basic
reduced form of PI Ί- in both MaPl and FePl
     I will agonize about this no further, and will formulate the Prefix-
Reduction rule as (127), allowing some latitude in the plural.","[167, 168]"
"    A very common construction for reciprocals expressing other than subject-
object coindexation involves a distributive subject ('each X') and the
possessed form of ά-m-idi 'friend' in the relevant non-subject position. In
context, the second referent can be translated 'the other' (892.a). The verb
underlying Agentive ά-m-idi is 'accompany' (PerfP -aeddew-, Imprt Idaw),
and the verb itself can be used in constructions translatable with 'together'
(892.b).

transcribed from dictation, allowing the speaker to repeat the sentences. My
other textual material is transcribed from recorded dialogues, and the reason
for choosing monologue dictation in this case was to allow the speaker to
smooth out the accentual phrasing (which can be ragged in spontaneous
dialogue due to the fact that phrasal accents work from right to left. Where
they are clear, I use brackets here to indicate the accentual phrases of more

    Parenthesized Ο before an allomorph indicates that the preceding syllable
(the word penult) is accented, even with nouns that would otherwise be
accented on an earlier syllable. In other words, the possessor suffixes in
question force penultimate word accent; cf. §3.3.1.1. In full word
transcriptions, such a suffixally induced accent is written as v, where ν is any
vowel. Note that the invariant forms in the leftmost column also have marked
penultimate accent. However, the 2Sg and 3Sg postconsonantal variants
(-annaek, etc.), take default accents.
    Examples showing the allomorphy are ISg mataji-nin 'my peanuts'
(mataji), e-hsen-nin 'my house' (e-haen), and alsibb-in 'my pocket' (slsibb);
and 3Sg matajl-nnet, e-hsen-net, and alsibb-annet. The postconsonantal forms

sonorants like {1 m r}, as in a-laemom-annaek 'your-MaSg young dama

7.1 Augment verbs with -t-7.1.1   Augmented and unaugmented V-final stemsWe will see that many verbs end in a C, but there are quite a few others that
end in a V. Of the V-final verbs, the majority are augment verbs (short for
augmented V-final verbs) that add a suffixal Augment (""Aug"" in interlinears)
-t- word-finally and before C-initial subject and Participle suffixes. The
Augment does not occur in non-participial nominals (VblN, Agentive, etc.). In
this section, I focus on the distribution of -t- itself, and on its effect on a
preceding V. The full set of stems for augment verbs is discussed below
(§7.3.1.6, §7.3.1.13, §7.3.1.16).
    While many augmented verbs are unrelated to nouns (except their own
derivatives), others are matched with an underived noun and may be
considered denominal, e.g. noun a e - r o r r 'patty from droppings put into
animal's mouth to prevent suckling', verb -ruru-t (PerfP -seqqorae-t) 'smear
(breast) to deter suckling' (VblN a e - r a r u ) . There are no other productive
denominal verbalizations.
    Augment -t- is absent before a V-initial subject suffix (303.a), whereupon
the stem-final V contracts with the suffix-initial V (§3.2.3). However, the
augment is present when there is no subject suffix (303.b), and when the
subject suffix begins in C-initial (303.c). The addition of clitics has no effect
on the presence/absence of -t-.
                                                 7.1 Augment verbs with -t-   295(303)   PerfP of 'fly away'        a. VV-Contraction (37.d) to e with V-initial suffix

               2FePl        t-affurrae-t-maet
               3FePl        affurrae-t-naet     In other dialects (A-grm Gao Κ R T-md), such stems begin with ae rather
than a in the perfective system (e.g. PerfP -aeffurrae-t). T-ka has harmonized
the stem-initial short V with the <H> V of the following syllable (cf. §3.2.6),
but in T-ka there is no synchronic evidence that the initial V is underlying fx/.
     The stem-final V is shortened before -t in ordinary inflected forms (PerfP,
Shlmpf), but when the final V is protected by a χ ablaut feature (as in the long
imperfectives) it does appear as a full V before -t. Thus 3MaSg PerfP
Ί-ffurrae-t (303.b) and 3MaSg Shlmpf l-ffurrs-t have short pre-augment V, but
3MaSg LoImpfP i-t-lfarru-t shows a full pre-augment V. See Pre-Augment
V-Shortening (115) (§3.4.9.2).
     There are a few augment verbs, belonging to a broader adjectival class,
whose perfective inflected forms allow a full V to surface before the -t-,
violating Pre-Augment V-Shortening, and usually keep the -t- even before
V-initial suffixes. An example is 'be speckled' (372.d), with 3MaSg PerfP
kaesa-t (not #kaesae-t) and 3MaPl kaesa-t-aen (not #ksese-n in this sense,
though the latter is attested as a MaSg participle). The verbs in question have
PerfP CaeCa-t and Imprt QeCae-t, or PerfP CaCa-t and Imprt CaCae-t. The
Imprt forms suggest that these verbs have a basic shape -CVCu- (+ -t), but
have the peculiarity that the stem-final υ is unconditionally lengthened to α in
the perfective. There are other (C-final) adjectival verbs that have a similar
long α (or other long V) in the second perfective syllable, e.g. PerfP -aezzay-
 'be heavy', bsehaw- 'be grey', and ssggcnr- 'be red'. While these adjectival
perfectives are lexically irregular, one could argue that they include a
lengthening formative χ (perhaps χ-f, i.e. applying to the final stem syllable),
and this χ blocks (or undoes) Pre-Augment V-Shortening in augment verbs
like CaeCa-t.
     In (304), below, we see that the augment -t- is present in all imperative
forms. Based on the non-imperative data in (303), this is not surprising in the
296     7 Verbal morphologycase of 2Sg (zero subject suffix) and 2FePl (C-initial suffix). However, the
presence of -t- is noteworthy in the case of 2MaPl (V-initial subject suffix).","[313, 314, 315]"
"    Here ak is an ""appetizer"" that marks the larger construction as an
interrogative, but we don't find out what kind of interrogative until the
WH-word sndek.

               definite demonstrative     participle         ablaut change    In (8.a), a morphophonological rule Prefix Reduction (e.g. -a- reduced to
-as-, or -i- reduced to -a-) applies to nouns in combinations with specific
preceding forms. Of special interest is the fact that reduction applies to the
12    2 Overviewverb-subject sequence, but not to a verb-object sequence. For more on the
role this plays in ""case marking,"" see §2.3, below.
    For verbs, the only true local dependency is that of an inflected verb on a
preceding Negative (8.b). This applies in all combinations where no elements
(other than floating clitics) intervene between the two, hence to perfective,
(long) imperfective, and imperative (i.e. prohibitive) stems. Basically the
modification converting Y to Y' adds phonetic content (where it is not
vacuous) in the perfective, reduces phonetic content (erasing a V-length ablaut
formative χ-pcl and an accent ablaut formative χ-pcl) in the imperfective and
prohibitive, and modifies the stem vocalism in all of these stems.
    The cases in (8.c) are limited to definite relative clauses, which begin
with a definite demonstrative (in apposition to the head NP, which if overtly
expressed is external to the clause). The modification in ablaut form of the
verb involves erasure of a V-length ablaut formative (χ-pcl), and (with
specific exceptions) a shift in the location of the ablaut accent formative (in
one combination, this formative is entirely erased). The formulation of the
relevant rules requires an extraordinary interpenetration of ""syntax"" and
""phonology,"" and constitutes an important empirical argument against highly
modularized theories of grammar.
    It is possible to combine two [X Y'...] configurations, as in the
combination [Negative verb noun(subject) ...]. In this combination, the
relevant pairs involving local dependencies are [Negative verb] and [verb
noun(subject)]. As a result, internal bracketing as in [Negative [verb
noun(subject)] ...] or [[Negative verb] noun(subject) ...] is counterproductive
(any such bracketing would appear to separate two forms that enter into a local
dependency). The only points that matter are adjacency (disregarding clitics)
and the grammatical relationship (e.g. Negative + verb, or verb +
noun(subject).
    Superficially similar cases are those in (9)(9)     [X Y'...] Dependencies Not Requiring Adjacency        X                     Y'          modification in Y'        Future particle       verb        Short Imperfective
        complementizer        verb        Short Imperfective    The cases in (9) involve either a Future particle or a particular type of
complementizer, plus an inflected ""Short Imperfective"" form. The latter cannot
be used clause-initially with its usual subject pronominal inflections. However,
the short imperfective is related to the positive imperative (which has no
morphological connection to the prohibitive). The positive imperative is
clause-initial (hence is preceded by no ""X"" element), and it lacks the usual
subject pronominals.
                                                                   2.2 Nouns      13     Importantly, while the [X Y' ...] depencies in (8) require direct adjacency
(except that they allow floating clitics to be hosted by X), the dependency of
the Short Imperfective on the Future particle or on the complementizer in (9)
can extend to a second short imperfective clause appended to the first one,
with no repetition of the X element. Thus [Future Shlmpf,, Shlmpf 2 ] is
grammatical, where both verbs are under the scope of the Future morpheme
(cf. English he will come, and eat). No confusion is likely, since the Shlmpf
cannot be used in the absence of a dependency. In other words, a Shlmpf can
be triggered by a variable-distance dependency; compare the concept of
""serie enchainee"" adapted from other Berberist literature to Tuareg by Leguil
(1992:43). By contrast, we cannot get e.g. #[Neg Verb,, Verty where both
verbs are under the scope of the negator; the correct expression is [Neg Verb,,
Neg Verb2] with the negator repeated, since adjacency is required in local
dependencies.","[30, 31, 32]"

             eff        effae-taen (A-grm)      'shelter'     In (148.a), I take the a as the surface output of stem-final underspecified
deletable hi. The verbs in question are of the shape -vCCi>, e.g. PerfP -ödha-
'fold'. It is much harder to establish a stem-final deletable V in noun stems,
though at least historically there was probably a stem-final V in 'palate'
(148.b), since a variant άητα is recorded for Im dialect.
     In the other cases in (148.c-d), with the possible exception of the A-grm
forms with a in the PI, an underlying stem-final V seems unlikely. In these
cases, however, the PI has a marked penultimate accent, though the Sg has a
default accent (which shifts onto a preceding preposition). This is seen by
adding prepositions, e.g. daer laz 'in the famine', PI daer laz-tasn 'in the
famines' (not #daer laz-taen). In effect, these plurals are accented as though
they had a V between stem and -tasn suffix, as heard audibly in the plurals of
'being inflated', 'palate', and 'grass'. Since no such V is audible, I have no
choice but to mark the plural with the acute accent (Ιάζ-tasn, kok-taen).
     The plurals in (148.a) and that of 'palate' in (148.c) are dialectally
variable. R idhi-taen 'foldings' has a full i. Likewise, T-ka PI Ijja-taen
'stretchings to look' corresponds to Rljji-taen and A-grm ""iggi-taen. While only
Im dialect has bisyllabic Sg ά η ν α 'palate', a few other dialects (A-grm, R)
have Sg άην but PI aqra-taen (K-area dialects have PI aqriw-en). For T-md I
recorded PI laz-taen 'hungers' with default accent (hence dser Ιαζ-tasn 'in ...').
     C-final stems of more than one syllable that take -taen rather than -aen are
shown in (149). Most of them have final accent, and all lack vocalic prefixes
(these are typical features of loanwords). The correlation with final accent is
seen clearly in T-ka wasil, PI wasil-taen versus other dialects' w a s i l , PI
wasil-aen.","[193, 194]"

406    7 Verbal morphology     A-grm usually reduces the lexical u to a short V, converting these stem-
shapes to -CVCCD- and -CvCCvCu- plus Augment, types covered in §7.3.1.6.
For middleweight 'be abundant' we therefore get A-grm PerfP abbaffae-t and
so on. For superheavy verbs, A-grm medial short V corresponding to u in other
dialects, cited in the PerfP, is seen in PerfP -kaekkaerae-t 'draw out',
-nsennaerae-t 'rub eyes', and -saessaefae-t 'tear off a strip' (A-grm also avoids
Stem-Initial V-Insertion in these stems).
     As usual in perfectives beginning with a short V plus a syllable with a full
high V, dialects other than T-ka and A-grm have initial ae instead of a (PerfP
-sebbuffae-t).
     I have recorded at least 20 verbs with paradigms of the middleweight 'be
abundant' subtype in (402), with both geminated and nongeminate medial
clusters. These include -dukru- 'get angry' (Imprt dukra-t), -buggu- 'admit an
error', and -kurdu- 'be dirty'.
     In the superheavy subtype exemplified by -jujjvbu- 'bind' in (402), my
primary T-ka speaker tended to degeminate the medial geminate when the
initial C was geminated by C|-Gemination. Therefore, PerfP -allüllaemae-t was
sometimes heard as -allülaemae-t for this speaker, whereas Imprt lüllsma-t
never appeared as #lubm3-t, and the LoImpfP was always -t-ilalbmu-t. This
degemination seems to be a feature of allegro speech, and it may be an
idiosyncracy of this speaker (I usually got the geminate pronunciation when I
elicited the form a second time). I checked these forms carefully with R and
K-d speakers and observed no degemination.
     The other verbs known to me of the superheavy subtype are these:
-fuffviO- 'scrub', -Yullvmu- 'wear' (K-d), -kukkvbu- 'be tied up tight',
-kukkvru- 'draw out', -lullvmu- 'trim', -mummvnu- 'pinch and twist',
-nunnvru- 'rub eyes', -sussvru- 'be rude', -sussvfu- 'tear off a strip', and
-zurrvbu- 'try, test' (cf. A-grm non-augment -zurvb-, PerfP -azzorab-). The
cluster seems to be a geminate in all cases.
     All of the verbs in (402) are subject (in T-ka) to u-Spreading and Medial
V-Shortening (§3.4.9.3) in short imperfective forms where Augment -t- is
omitted and the stem-final V contracts with a V-initial subject suffix. This
happens in the lSg, 2Sg, 2MaPl, and 3MaPl subject forms, which are
expressed by -aeC suffixes. The same morphophonological processes apply
throughout the long imperfective paradigms.
     Consider the sample short imperfectives in (403), where 3MaPl -aen
illustrates what happens when a V-initial subject suffix is present. In the
3MaPl, a putative representation (after Melodic Association) /abbuffi-aen/,
perhaps already contracted to /sbbuffi-n/, first spreads the quality features of
the /u/ to the stem-final i, and then shortens the /u/ to a before a cluster.
                                    7.3 Verb classes and irregular verbs     407(403)   Short Imperfectives (T-ka) with u-Spreading and Medial V-Shortening            gloss                3MaSg                3MaPl            'be much'            1-bbuffa-t           abbsffu-n

            'fear'               i-mmüttasa-t          ammattasu-n     In the I, Kidal-area, and R dialects, Medial V-Shortening and u-Spreading
are absent. For K(K-f and optionally K-d), I recorded 3MaPl affuffari-n. This
is phonologically straightforward, assuming basic form -fiiffvru-, Shlmpf <H>
melody, and /i-se/ contracting to i (parallel to /u-ae/ contracting to u in T-ka).
However, for I and R dialects (and optionally for K-d), I recorded forms with e
instead of i, hence 3MaPl Shlmpf abbuffe-n and affuffare-n. These Shlmpf
forms have an odd resemblance to the corresponding perfectives, where stem-
final /a/ contracts with suffixal /as/ to give e, as in 3MaPl PerfP aebbuffe-n
'they were abundant' in these same dialects. It would seem that the e in the
Shlmpf forms in these dialects is due to an unusual analogy from perfective to
Shlmpf, and I will not attempt to derive these forms phonologically.
     I now turn to stems where the full V occurs in a noninitial open syllable
in the basic representation. The stems in question have the shapes -CvCuCu-,
-CvCCuCu- just (one attested unaugmented verb, see (406) later in this
section, and -CVCVCCUCD-. These stems have <L> melodies in the perfective,
and except for the rare -CvCCuCu- stem shape they have a lexically
determined high V (u or i) in the imperfectives and in the VblN. I consider the
high V to be part of the basic representation.
     Verbs of the shapes -CvCuCu- and -CVCVCCUCD- with lexical u are
illustrated in (404).","[424, 425, 426]"

3.2.4   Resyllabification (Final-CC Schwa-Insertion)Resyllabification occurs when an unstable word-final CC cluster results from
the deletion of a final V. The relevant rule is Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29)
(§3.1.2.4). The deletion rule applies to short imperfectives and VblN's of
V-final verbs. These verbs have a clear word-final α in the perfective stem
system, but some of them have short imperfective (including Imprt) ending in
III, an abstract, underspecified V. Many of the verbs are of the basic shape
-vCCu- or -u>CCi>, and when the final υ is deleted we get a CC cluster. Some
CC clusters are stable in word-final position. However, if the cluster is not a
geminate, and if the final C is a sonorant, it cannot be pronounced as such, so
resyllabification is required.
     An example is /askni/, Sg Imprt of 'make', which appears as akan in T-ka,
but as akan in most other dialects. Compare PerfP -akna-, which shows the
stem-final V more clearly (-vkno-). Another verb, in form perhaps the
causative of this -vknu-, is -s-vkni> 'show', with Imprt s-akan (A-grm T-ka)
or s-akan (Im K-d R T-md). Because -s-vknu-, unlike -vknu-, is long enough
to quality for the VblN type with a - Sg prefix and <H> vocalic melody, we get
VblN / a - s - a k n i / in T-ka and several other dialects, and this too must be
resyllabified when the III is deleted. The Sg VblN appears variably as
α-s-akann (T-ka), α - s - a k a n (Im R), α-s-akan (T-md), or α-s-kan (K-d),
62     3    Phonologydepending on what other rules apply (gemination, syncope, accent shift).
A-grm, on the other hand, has a-s-akni, retaining the original final V, so no
resyllabification is needed there.
     As these examples show, resyllabification takes the form of insertion of a
(Final-CC Schwa-Insertion, see below) to break up a nongeminate final CC
cluster whose second element is a sonorant, and is accompanied in T-ka by
accent shift onto the epenthetic schwa and by gemination of the final C. The
accent shift (Epenthetic-Vowel Accentuation) and the doubling of the final
sonorant in the VblN and other nominalizations (Stem-Final Gemination) are
covered in §3.3.2. Both processes are characteristic of T-ka but do not apply in
most other dialects. Even in T-ka, neither is a general phonological rule,
though both are parasitic on Final-CC Schwa-Insertion.
    Final-CC Schwa-Insertion also feeds Short-V Harmony, though this
interaction is somewhat difficult to analyse. The relevant fact here is the shift
of the initial /as/ in e.g. /askni/ 'make!-Sg' to a in akan, apparently under the
influence of the medial schwa. See §3.2.6, below, for discussion.
    Consider the data in (43), which show the morphological contexts where
Resyllabification can occur. In all cases the stem in question is an
unaugmented verb whose final V is deletable.","[80, 81]"

connection with Stem-Initial Syncope was sketched in §3.2.7.1, where it helps
reconcile the loss, by Stem-Initial Syncope, of the short V following χ in PerfP
-aexbabas-t with the observation that the syncope rule elsewhere specifically
targets a and does not affect ae. This ceases to be a problem if the syncopated
V is schwa at the point when Stem-Initial Syncope applies, as in the derivation
(95).

            -sexbabae-t          surface form     Because Melodic Association for perfective verbs produces sequences of
the maximal type «HHLLL», there are never more than two Η-vowel syllables
at the beginning of the stem. In all relevant cases, the perfective stem begins
with a nonlexical initial short V, the first schwa of /axababae-t/, which is
therefore followed by no more than one other schwa-syllable before the
melody switches from Η to L. Stem-Initial Syncope deletes this second schwa,
giving /axbabas-t/. It remains merely to change the initial /a/ to as. If we
allowed Short-V Harmony to work in a symmetrical fashion, we could
attribute the initial ae of -aexbabae-t to this harmony rule. However, sequences
like aCCa are stable in other contexts, including perfectives of -vCCu- verbs
like -aksa- 'eat', so I have elsewhere expressed doubts about a symmetrical
formulation of Short-V Harmony (§3.2.6). As a result, I recognize Leftward
L-Spreading as a morphologically sprecialized rule converting the initial /a/ to
ae in (95).
     There are some alternative options, especially for dialects other than T-ka.
In T-ka, the maximal melody for perfectives is «HHLLL», and there is no
reason to consider an alternative «LHLLL» which would unproblematically
become «LLLL» after Stem-Initial Syncope (deleting the Η vowel). However,
in the dialects other than T-ka and A-grm, it is much more reasonable to allow
«LHLLL» as a maximal melody for perfectives. In particular, in these dialects
(K-d, R, T-md), we get surface «LHLLL» when the Η syllable is full, i.e. i or
u. This applies even to verbs like -xvbubu- (+ -t), namely in the Resit stem,
which appears as -axlbabas-t in T-Ka but as -aexlbabae-t in the other dialects
mentioned. In these non-T-ka dialects, it may be best to formulate Stem-Initial
V-Insertion (see below) so that the added stem-initial V is specified as as. This
would actually work for T-ka as well, since Short-V Harmony would convert
/ae/ to a under the influence of the Η vowel of the following syllable. However,
in T-ka there is no direct evidence for initial /as/ in these perfectives, and since
«HHLLL» is a reasonable mapping of <H L> onto perfective verb stems I am
inclined to have Stem-Initial V-Insertion just insert an unspecified short V in
T-ka.
     There is an intriguing similarity between Leftward L-Spreading in (95) on
the one hand, and a dialectal alternation of the type -aPaQ- versus -aePQ- in
the short imperfective (including Imprt). Examples: Future ad t-awat 'she will
hit' versus, depending on dialect, ad awat-aer (e.g. T-ka) or ad aewt-aer (e.g.
K-d) Ί will hit'. The variants of type -aewt- occur chiefly in the Kidal area
((49), §3.2.6.2). These variants show the same pattern suggested in the
                                                             3.4 Ablaut     123derivation (95), namely syncope of a second-syllable schwa accompanied by
switch of a stem-initial schwa to ae. However, to my knowledge, T-ka does not
show this output type in short imperfectives: ad awst-aer Ί will hit'.
    In A-grm, Stem-Initial Syncope does not apply to the perfectives in (94),
but we get stem-wide <L> vocalism anyway. Thus -xaebabae-t, -taerara-,
-s-aemm-askae-t, -s-aennaem-aehael-, and so forth. In A-grm, therefore, there is
no connection between Leftward L-Spreading and Syncope, since the
spreading rule applies in the absence of Syncope. I will not venture here into
the question whether A-grm preserves an archaic, Proto-Tuareg system, or has
recently reshaped the perfectives (ultimately on the model of the Imprt, e.g.
xsbubs-t, tsrur).
    Aside from the cases where (outside of A-grm) Stem-Initial Syncope and
Leftward L-Spreading are correlated, there are a few nonsyncopating verb
types that have stem-wide <L> melody in the perfective. These are light stems
beginning with a full V (-uCu-, -uCvC-, -uCCi>, etc.), and middleweight
stems of shape -CuCvC- with a full V after the first C. An example is in (96).","[140, 141, 142]"

many cases by another vocalic shift in the second syllable. The stems in (159-

     Rather more common than the full-V alternations in (160) are alternations
of short V in the Sg with full α in the PI, before a CC cluster. The short V is
normally ae (161.a), though there is a less common pattern where the Sg has a
at least as a variant (161.b). As in (160), the cases in (161) are feminines with
Fe prefix t- but no Fe suffix (unless final e or α is taken to be a Fe suffix), and
the basic t-u-CvCCe Sg shape in (161) is similar in accent and in syllabic
structure to the t-b-CeCe Sg shape in (160).

4.1.1.11     Stem-final vowel shifts before ...w- and PI suffixAs noted in §4.1.2.6, w or t commonly appears between a stem-final full vowel
and the vowel of MaPl -asn or FePl -en. The t cases generally involve no
change in the stem, and I take it to be a quasi-epenthetic suffixal element. On
the other hand, the w cases quite often do show changes in the preceding
vowel, and the w behaves more like a stem-final than a suffix-initial segment.
A generous sample of the w cases is displayed in (162). The shifts e to i, α to i,
and e to a, are all common. Leaving aside the prefixes and suffixes, the stems
in question are nearly always bisyllabic.","[203, 204]"
