3.10.2. Interrogative words
        The interrogative words include lfijhg 'something'; /sty 'someone', /&l
'somewhere', lkhy61U'when', and /fie/ 'how'. They typically occur at the beginning of
a sentence if they are immediate constituents of the matrix clause.(137) fifni h& qkhyimi)t%                'What did you buy?'

and ( 144a) below. However, when the interrogative form occurs in an embedded
question, the question particle does not occur. The clause in (144b),which is a direct
question, has the interrogative particle /h&/.(143) b ~ s & t fifd

from W@/.      In fact, one of my consultants occasionally says [fikkhY&],instead of
[fi6hY$]. It explains why L-effect takes place, changing [h] to [E], as in example (138),
when [h] follows N.

"The class membership of the quantified noun does not predict which variant occurs.

2.5.17. Vowel Truncation
        When two vowels occur sequentially across a word boundary, one of the
vowels is dropped. This process only affects a sequence of a noun or a particle plus a
verb-initial pronominal prefix on the following verb. If the first vowel is unstressed,
the first of the two vowels is dropped. If the first vowel is stressed, as in lexical stems
and some particles (e.g. question particle [h$]), Lhen it is the second vowel that is
deleted. The tones of the two vowels are assigned to the undeleted vowel.
       The Vowel Truncation rule consists of two parts: the first part deletes one of
the successive vowels; the second assigns both tones to the remaining vowel.","[99, 100, 101]"

1.2. Jemez and the Kiowa-Tanoan language family
        Jernez belongs to the Kiowa-Tanoan language family. It is the only member of
the Towa branch of the family. The other branches are Tewa, Tiwa, and Kiowa.
Tewa, Tiwa, and Towa are generally grouped as ""Tanoan"" languages. It was John
Powell(189 1) who first used the name ""Taiioan"" to group them. He treated Kiowa as
constituting a different family ""Kiowan"" at the time. J. P. Harrington (1910a) was the
first to propose the classification of the Tanoan languages into three branches-Tewa,
Tiwa, and Towa. He also noted similarities in vocabulary and sounds between Kiowa
and Tanoan languages (Harrington 191Ob). The genetic relationship between these
groups of languages is well established through the comparative works of Wick Miller
(19591, George and Edith Trager (Trager and Trager 1959), Kenneth Hale (1962,-1967), and Laurel Watkins (1 977, 1978).
        There are still questions regarding the internal relationship of the language
family. Some linguists-for     instance, Irvine Davis (1959) and George Trager
(1967)-suggested     that the family had first split into Kiowa and Tanoan. Others hinted
that this might not be the case. Watkins writes that ""the label Kiowa-Tanoan reflects an
obvious cultural division rather than a linguistic one"" (1984:2).1 (See also Paul
Kroskrity ( 1993:56-57).)
       It is not certain if there was any other language in the Towa sub-group. It has
been generally assumed that Pecos spoke another dialect of Towa. Harrington wrote
that Jemez and Pecos were two dialects of the Towa language:
       It was also suggested that the dialects of group B be known as constituting the
       Towa language, since the term tdwa, meaning ""native,"" is applied by the Jemez
       and Pecos to their own language. (Harrington 1910a: 13)
However, the Jemez historian, Joe Sando, rejects this assumption: ""What few words
are known of the Pecos language sound more Tewa than Towa"" (1982: 149).
       In this dissertation, I will use the name ""Jemez"" to refer to the language under
investigation.","[18, 19]"
"
2.3. Phonotactics
2.3.1. Syllable structure and types
        The most common syllable types in Jemez are CV and CVV.10 Closed
syllables ending with a consonant, either [S] or [I], do occur in surface forms, but only
word-finally before a pause. All the possible syllable types are shown along with
examples in (3).(3)     v                 [e-] 'pronominal pfx'         [Q-] 'pronominal pfx'
        W                 [ea-] 'pronominal pfx'
        CV                [p61 'sun'                    [kwi3] 'medicine'
        CW                r6-]'branch'                  [p$*] 'deer'
        CVC               [&3] 'buttocks'               [sal 'seven'
                          bill 'eight'
        CWC               [figs] 'cottontail rabbits'   [wi-l]'four'10In the discussion of the syllable structure, V is used to represent a short vowel, and
VV a long vowel. Thus CV refers to an open syllable with a short vowel, while CVV
represents an open syllable with a Iong vowel.
        Even when a syllable-final consonant occurs on the surface, there is a tendency
toward a CV template in the language, i.e. a tendency toward eliminating a closed
syllable in favor of an open syllable. For instance, the 'inverse' suffix /-Uis often
omitted from the noun stem, and when it does occur before a verb stem with a
pronominal prefix, speakers usually pause slightly between the noun stem and the
suffix, and pronounce [S] and the following vowel (i.e. the initial vowel of the
pronominal prefix on the verb) as one syllable: e.g. [v8*la:Sijq 'Men (du) fell off' <
/v&la-S P-Si/ (man-inv intr[3du]-fall.sg/pf). In the early 1920's Elsie Clews Parsons'
(Parsons 192570) transcription [ywa' kishi sernihy] 'your children send' suggests
that the pronominal verbal prefix [i] was already phonetically bound to the inverse
number suffix [-sh] in [kjshi].)
        Word-internally, closed syllables are not possible in present-day Jemez, but it
appears that there used to be a consonant cluster of word-medial [t] plus a stop
consonant in the language: [pdpa'] '(term for) September-October' (Parsons 1925:75).
        Although long consonants also occur, they are not contrastive. Voiceless stops,
particularly lpl, N and Ity/,are lengthened if the preceding vowel is short and stressed:
                      'weak';lsipaeyd [sippaeya] 'marry'. l l
e.g. 14itYimv[@itYtYirnd
        There is a remaining question of whether Jemez has true vowel-initial syllables.
What appear to be syllable-initial vowels in some roots start at a low pitch level, the
pitch quickly rising as the vowel is pronounced. Often a voiced glottal fricative [fi] is
heard before the vowel: e.g. [fii.p7ae] 'yesterday'. l2 ' [fi] is present at least in root-
initial syllables. Hale (1967) points out that in all the Kiowa-Tanoa languages except1lThe double consonant symbols here indicate long consonants; they do not mean
rearticulated geminate consonants.
l2Laurel Watkins (personal communication) observes a similar low-high tonal pattern
on syllable-initial vowels and on vowels which follow an initial voiced consonant, and
argues that there is a voiced laryngeal /W at the beginning of what appear to be vowel-
initial syllables.
Jemez, there is a consonantal alternation under some morphosyntactic conditions: /h/       -
/X/ (Taos), /h/   - /X/ (Tewa), /h/ - /kh/(Kiowa). In Jemez, this alternation is between /@/
(zero) and /h/ according to his transcription. (See Section 2.5.5 for details.) He
reconstructs an *h    - *khalternation for Proto-Kiowa-Tanoan. If this is true, Proto-
Kiowa-Tanoan *khchanged to /h/ and *h to /M in Jemez. In fact, setting up an
underlying /W helps us explain synchronic phonological alternations, and I include the
segment in my consonant inventory.","[38, 39, 40]"
"        (27)    Another consonant alternation, [kb] to [h] (in the particle [ha]), is seen
here. (See also sentences (30) and (37) below.) The question particle [h$] may have
contained an initial FhY]
                       in the past. Another consultant occasionally says [fi6khy&]
'how', instead of [fikhy&]. This possibility is also supported by the existence of the
interrogative word [seE$] 'who'. The word consists of /SW 'who, someone' and the
question particle, and exhibits an apparent case of L-effect. (/khY/
                                                                   changes to [E] after an
underlying /I/.)        (28)    FwzlelPe(S)] literally means '(ones who) are now', and refers
specifically to today's young people in the sentence.
       (29)    There is a very brief pause before the instrumental marker [@*l, which
is normally suffixed to a noun.
       (37)    [mt]'feel', which often occurs in compound stative verbs, is used as a
main verb here.
       (38)    [ep&m$e] 'what they used to do', as the speaker means it here, includes
things such as dances that they used to do but do not do any longer.

       This complex suffix is probably related to the locative suffix /-n)/ 'place (where
something takes place)' which is illustrated in (340).(340) khYaitY8h+?iwg q%n$              'I am going down to where you are.'

The complement clause marked by l-d$ni/ is suffixed to the perfective or potential form
of the subordinate verb. It usually indicates the purpose of an action conveyed by the
verb of the main clause, which is often   r$J'come' or [m$] 'go'.

       Another complex suffix /-d%khe/also indicates the purpose of an action. The
difference is that the sentence which contains /-d%ngmeans something like 'X

/-d$khe/.

         This section presents some of the more commonly used particles. Since the
meanings of these particles are not well understood, only a general context of use is
discussed.
4.10. l. Tense-aspectual particle
4.10.1.1./khYa/
         /khya/is a tense-aspect particle which can be used with active or stative verbs. It
may occur with the perfective, the imperfective (and progressive) or the future of active
verbs.(345) khYa~t~&*'6                'He is awake. (= He has waken up.)'

        khya 0-th-mfse-h$-      (TA intr[3bas]-fadpotn-fut)The particle also occurs following /da/. In this case, the verb is in the potential.(352) da khyairne7;7q           'I will go then.'
                                (I first refused to go, but then changed my mind.)

4.10.2. Modal particles
4.10.2.1. /da/, /ds/
        /do/ and /da/ are used in hortative and optative constructions, which includes
the potential form of active verbs or the basic or potential form of stative verbs. While   '
/da/ occurs when the S or A of the verb is first or third person, /dz/ only appears with
the second person S or A.(353) h& bB16 da tat3Pk 'I will eat the bread.' 'Let me eat the bread.'

        d z m&ni                (opt slow/stat)        /die/ plus the potentid form of a verb can be used as an indirect command,
most commonly with intransitive verbs.

(357) die t&s6          'Sit down.' (or 'You can sit down.')
        da= l-tYh-sC (opt refl-seatlpotn)Note that although the first part of the pronominal prefix does not appear after the
particle / d d , the morpheme N is still present.(358) daethk*?o         'Wakeup.'(orbYoucanwakeup.')
        dre 1-sWo       (opt reWpl-wake.up/potn)
        /k'""il/ is most commonly used with the perfective, active or passive, but it is also
found to occur when the verb is in the future plus      /-?&g/,   which expresses the speaker's
wish that something had happened.(359) n&-tq kwi khY6*li%ipik7y&                     'She made a basket for me.'

4.10.2.3. /h$/
       /h&/, which is homophonous with the question particle lhu,is commonly
found in commands, and sometimes together with the particle /dal or /dad and the
potential form of the verb.(366) h$ da qth$-30                    'He can wake up.'

4.10.2.4. /bin$/
       /'h@&/also appears in commands. According to one of my consultants, /hh$/means something like 'Will you . . .?' However, /h$$/ can also occur with a first-
person S or A.(368) h$$    be16 q h 6 . l ~   'Bake bread.' ('Will you bake bread?')

4.10.2.5. /hed&/
       /h6dk/ is typically found in admonitive construction with the subordinating
suffix I-?&/.(See Section 4.8.8 for examples.)
4.10.2.6. /dakwil/
       /dak""il/, which appears to consist of the particles /da/ and WiY, means 'maybe'.   .

4.10.3.1. /gYa/
       /gYa/ is used to report what the speaker heard.

    5.0. Introduction
             The following text is a personal narrative told by one of my older consultants
    about her childhood. The text serves two purposes: (a) it illustrates, in natural
    discourse, some of the phonological and morphological points discussed in the
    preceding chapters; (b) it gives a glimpse into aspects of Jemez life, both past and
    present.
            After transcribing the text from the tape, I checked my transcription with the
    same speaker. During the second session, she explained details and helped to refine the
    translation, and in addition, she sometimes made corrections to her original. All the
    changes are noted in Section 5.1.4.
            Each line is marked with a number enclosed in parentheses in order to make it
    easy to relate the text to the translation, the interlinear gloss, and the notes. Each line
    represents a single clause or a rnain clause and an embedded clause. A comma indicates
    places where the speaker paused.","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265]"

        When P is a Class IV noun, normally only the basic-number prefixes (i.e.         /a-/,
/Q-/,/e-/) are used. There is no basicfinverse distinction reflected in the transitiveprefixes for Class N nouns. However, a few mass nouns in Class TV occur with both
the basic-number and the plural prefixes which also cooccur with some nouns of
Classes I, 11 and m.considering that Class IV are mass nouns, the term 'plural
prefix' may not be totally appropriate, but it is used here to refer to these verbal
prefixes. (See the next section for a discussion of the plural prefixes.)
        The verbal agreement facts about transitive prefixes are summarized in Table                Table 10. Transitive prefixes by basic/inverse distinction

referred to as 'inverse prefixes' from here on. Except when the exact number such as
singular, dual, or plural, is in question, the term 'inverse prefix' indicates non-dual
inverse, i.e., either singular or plural, depending on the noun class.
3.4.3. Plurality and verbal agreement
        Nouns of Class I, 11, and III in the basic number are normally indicated by a
null prefix on intransitive verbs. However, some Class II and III nouns can also be
indexed with the verbal prefix /il-/ when plural. The difference between (28a) and
(28b), and between (29a) and (29b), is that the latter in each pair implies that the boxes
fell off all at once. /il-1 seems to occur when the items are perceived as a collection.(28)    a.      ty&tibatyi               'Boxes (pl) fell off.'           (Class 11)

category. Table l l lists the transitive prefixes (A and P arguments) with plural P

        Examples of nouns which can cooccur with the plural prefixes are provided
separately in Sections 3.4.4.1 through 3.4.4.3. Note that some Class IV nouns are
also found with these prefixes, although they are mass nouns and do not take the
inverse suffix /-S/. '(see Section 3.4.4.4 for the details.)8All these plural prefixes contain a final /l/
                                             which only surfaces when it occurs before
certain 'L-effect' consonants: e.g. [h@ ithp] 'He chewed bones.' c /h60 il-S@/ (bones

3.4.4. Noun class membership
       We will now look at the membership of nouns in each class.9
3.4.4.1. Class I nouns
       The basic number of nouns in this class is singular, so the inverse is dual and
plural. The class consists mostly of animate nouns, including terms for people,
animals, birds and insects. Inanimate nouns in this class include a few plants and
heavenly bodies.
(33)   a. Human:
               v&la 'man'            ?6*w6 'woman'          ?ipekhYi'girl'
               ?$khyi'boy'           n@Sipa=ya 'potter'     khyime'trader, vendor'
               hi. 'Jemez'           kV$l$ 'Navajo'         w&hi 'corpse'
       b. Non-human, animate:
               t6*tYa'buffalo'       w6-gYbSa'cow'          p$* 'deer'
               khy@?ni'dog'          mpsb 'cat'             khY6.'crow'
               ?&pila 'turtle'       wh*?ida 'frog'         hkyh 'snake'
               +i.y4 'fly'           '&mg 'ant'             tYi+=minq'centipede'
               h6db 'grasshopper'                           w$de713 'egg'
9There is some disagreement among my main consultants regarding the class
membership of some nouns. The nouns are: [zb*l&]'cone shell' (I or II), r5qpzkhyi]
'doll' (Class I or m),&'a?qnpkhYi]   'kachina (doll)' (I or m),[pkhiele] 'blanket' (I1 or
ID),[p%] 'mountain' (II or III), F@mitk] 'shovel' (II or III). [z6*16] 'cone shell'
could be perceived as either animate or inanimate, and when treated as animate, it must
be a member of Class I. ri$pzkhyg'doll' and [kVa3qnqkhyi]     'kachina (doll)' may be
considered Class I because they have humans as models. One reason why [h@mi&]
'shovel', a compound whose original meaning is a 'stick to bring out sand', is treated
as Class 11 may be because [tY&] 'stick' is a member of this class. Only those nouns
whose class membership data were elicited from two or more speakers and for which
there is no disagreement among the speakers, are given in this section.
(33)   c. Plants:
               weha; 'pumpkin' sqd6ya 'watermelon'
       d. Heavenly bodies:
               p?&* 'moon'         wQh~'star'
The following nouns are found with non-inverse plural prefixes.
(34)           p?$- 'moon'         w$hq- 'pumpkin'          w Q h ~'star'
3.4.4.2. Class I1 nouns
       Class I1 nouns have plural as the basic number, and singular and dual as the
inverse. All the nouns are inanimate objects. Terms for tools, plants and body parts
are distributed between Classes 11 and m.
(35)   a. Man-made objects:
               gYCba='water jar'   t&sa 'cup'               v&si 'drinking glass'

(35)   b. Plants:

               pB 'flower'
       c. Body parts:
               w&t% 'ear'           Wse 'nose'             hij*Wyk 'knee'
               t3+"" 'head'          w.16 'head-hair'       ?ij*'n?4'foot'
               tY8'animal horn'
       Those Class II nouns which are indexed with non-inverse plural prefixes are as
follows:               @?l%'apple'            tY&'mow'                d&bh 'board, door'               nQto 'book, paper'     tY&tiba'box'            ty$- 'cactus'               % l e e 'chair'        bityl' 'fork'           fi6Ie 'hat'

               tYe'stick'             pf(n0 'thread'
       There are a few other plant terms which appear to belong to this class,
according to some speakers, but at least one speaker uses the inverse intransitive prefix
le-l for both singular and plural objects, presenting a new paradigm. (Compare thiswith the prefixes in Table 6.)

These heads are normally not incorporated but there are exceptions. In (268b) and

        /-he/ is suffixed to the potential form of an active verb or the basic form of most
stative verbs. (See Section 4.8.5 'Stative verbs'.) It indicates that an action or event is
predicted to happen in the future.39(282) d&b$ teEi,16hi?i            'I am going to open the door.'

differ in tonal patterns.

            most commonly means an aborted or unfulfilled action. It is suffixed to

form of a stative verb, it indicates that a state or a condition existed in the past.","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"
"
        Finally, the first syllable of lexical stems is more prominent than subsequent
syllables, regardless of what tone it carries. This is because the initial syllable is
always stressed? In pronominal prefixes, on the other hand, no stress is placed on
any syllable.
        Almost all the examples cited in this section are single-root stems, and the tonal
patterns found in them also occur in compounds (nouns and verbs) and incorporation
(nouns and verbs). This fact indicates the existence of some tonal rules. They will be
discussed in Section 2.4.3.2sThis point is confirmed by Alan Bell's acoustic phonetic study (Bell 1992). He
writes that the stress is always placed on the stem-initial syllable and that it is not a
property of a H or F tone per se.
2.4.2. Underlying tones
        The surface tones can be reduced to three underlying tones-High,      Falling, and
Low. Most surface Mid tones are derived from underlying F. (See Section 2.4.3 for
the details.) The analysis of underlying tones is based on the distribution and contrast
of surface tones.""   Let us first consider pairwise the distribution of surface tones.
Both H and L can occur after H in roots. It is not possible to predict what tone (H or
L) will occur in the second syllable of disyllabic roots whose initial syllable carries H
tone, e.g. [w&pil 'nit', [@bpi]'brown'. Thus these two surface tones must be marked
                  and M (9)on short vowels must also be marked in underlying
underlyingly. H (0)
representation because they are found after H in disyllabic stems, e.g. [tb-sC] 'hit/potn9, '
[tb-s'e] 'hit/pf'. H and F contrast, e.g. [ail 'sore', [ail 'buckskin', [w&tpb]'be quiet',
[wS-t%] 'be cold'. It seems that the surface M and L tones must also be distinguishedsince they occur in minimal pairs, e.g. [khY&?n8
                                               'dog', [khy$nâ‚¬]'tired', [mhSam'a;]
'loan/pf', [m@Sama;] 'loan/potn, go to borrowlpf.27
       On the other hand, surface F and M tones on short vowels do not contrast: they
are in complementary distribution. F normally occurs in the initial syllable of lexical
stems, while M appears non-initially. When monosyllabic roots with F tone occur as
the right-most members in compounds, their tone changes to M in surface
representation, e.g. [tY] 'head', [p&*t?i]'deer-dance headpiece (deer + head)', [tye]
                       'firewood' (fireplace + wood)'.
'wood, stick', [@kkW6t%]
       Although surface F and L must logically be treated as underlyingly different
since M and L contrast, and F and M belong to the same underlying tone, the
relationship between these surface tones is not straightforward. They are never found
261n the analysis, only native Jemez words were used, since many Spanish loanwords
exhibit different tonal patterns.
27See Section 2.5.3 for the relation between tone and glottalization.
in the same position within lexical stems: F occurs in initial syllable where L does not,
and L appears in non-initial position where the surface F is not possible. In fact, two
of the examples cited earlier to show the contrast between the surface M and L,
[mQSam&] 'loadpf', [me-Samq] 'loan/potn', are compounds, containing [m&]
'give/pf' and [m@] 'give/potn', respectively. Since surface H is always H underlyingly
and the H tone was lowered to L in [me-Samq] 'loadpotn', the underlying contrast in
these examples is between underlying F and H rather than F and L. Although surface F
and L do not occur in true minimal pairs, these tones are treated as different
underlyingly.","[50, 51, 52]"

                                        ABSTRACT
        This is a descriptive study of Jemez (or Towat-a      Native American language of
the Kiowa-Tanoan family, spoken at the Pueblo of Jemez in New Mexico. It provides
a detailed account of the phonology, noun morphology, and verb morphology.
Although the phonological analysis in this work is essentially generative, a
phenomenon-oriented approach is used rather than a model-oriented approach. Data
contained in this dissertation should be readily accessible and comprehensible to other
linguists.
        Jemez has a large vowel and consonant inventory. There are 22 vowels,
distinguished by vowel length and nasality as well as tongue height and lip rounding.
Some of the surface consonants have a limited distribution and are derived from
underlying segments. The alternation of various consonants is the most prominent
feature of Jemez phonology, and is useful for understanding the morphology,
particularly the verbal morphology. The language has four surface tones, derived from
three underlying tones.
        Just as in other Kiowa-Tanoan languages, Jemez nouns are grouped into four
classes on the basis of what is called 'basic number'. The noun classification is
reflected in the distribution of the nominal 'inverse-number' suffix and coreferential
demonstratives and in the pronominal verbal prefixes which encode grammatical
relations.
        There are two ways of grouping Jemez verbs: one is according to the criteria of
transitivity and stativity, which results in four verb types: transitive active, transitive
stative, intransitive active, and intransitive stative. The other is a grouping into
morphological classes of verbs, based on the shared inflectional properties. This
classification takes into account the alternations of root-final consonants and tonal
patterns in inflected stems, among others.
       The dissertation includes a short narrative. It illustrates, in natural discourse,
some of the phonological and morphological points, and also gives a glimpse into
aspects of Jemez life, both past and present. The appendices include a list of Spanish
loanwords and Jemez numerals.
                                  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
           This dissertation is finally finished. Its completion has been made possible by
    the enduring support and assistance I received from many people.
           First, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my Jemez friends,
    without whose help this project would have been impossible. I will always remember
    their friendship and hospitality. They treated me like a family member. The people
    who taught me the language were extremely patient and showed genuine enthusiasm for
    their language. It was a privilege to work with them.
           I am greatly indebted to the CO-directorsof the dissertation, Professors Akira
    Yamamoto and Laurel Watkins. They read many earlier drafts of this dissertation
    carefully and thoroughly. Professor Watkins has spent so much time for me from the
    beginning of the research. As an authority on the Kiowa-Tanoan language family, she
    made me realize things which I would not have otherwise. She is responsible for many
    improvements in my analyses and the overall organization. (Needless to say, all errors
    are my fault.) Professor Yamamoto was always prompt in providing me with detailed
    and meticulous comments, which contributed to making this a better dissertation than if
    it were not for his careful reading. Furthermore, Professor Yarnarnoto was always
    there when I struggled and needed help; he provided continual encouragement and
    unfailing support. Without him, I would not be where I am now. My utmost respect
    goes to Professor Yamamoto.
           I have also received valuable comments from Professors Clifton Pye, Michael
.   Henderson, and ShengLi Feng.
           I would like to thank my teachers in the Linguistics Department of the
    University of Kansas. In addition to Professors Yamamoto, Henderson, and Pye,
    Professors Frances Ingemann, Kenneth Miner, Keith Percival, and Robert Rankin have
taught me a great deal about linguistics. Mary Haas deserves special recognition: she
introduced me to Native American languages when she came to teach at the University
of Kansas as a visiting professor.
        Kenneth Hale did a pioneering work on the Jemez (Towa) language and has
generously made copies of his Jemez grammar notes available to me and other
researchers. I find his insight into Jemez even more impressive now than before since I
know the language better.
        I have also benefited from the discussions I had with Robert Sprott, Randall
and Anna Speirs.
       The majority writing of this dissertation was done while I was on leave from
teaching at Bucknell University. For their support and understanding, I thank my
colleagues in the East Asian Studies Department, particularly Paul Noguchi and Jarnes
Pusey. The College of Arts and Sciences at Bucknell provided me with a fund to help
me travel to Kansas for the dissertation defense. For this, I thank Dean Eugenia
Gerdes and Associate Dean Mark Padilla.
       The fieldwork was made possible by grants from the American Philosophical
Society, Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, and Whatcorn
Museum Society, and by a Summer Fellowship from the University of Kansas. I
gratefully acknowledge their financial assistance.
        I would also like to thank Betty Jo Miller, Anita Herzfeld, Valeria and Stoian
Petrescu, David Lu, and Betty Steffensen for their kindnesses.
        Finally, a very special gratitude goes to my parents, Suhachiro and Kinuyo, and
to my family, Chutatip and Hideki, who have made many sacrifices to help me
complete this project. I dedicate this dissertation to them and to the Jernez people.

something can happen. The potentid may indicate the speaker's intention of taking an
action or giving permission to someone. It is also used in situations where the speaker
wants to suggest or propose an action. It can be a polite way of giving a command.
The potential is, in short, a modal category. The verb is usually preceded by the
particle Idal or its variant /d;e/.23                                   'I will send it.'

23ld2el is used when the A is second person (i.e. the addressee), while /da/ occurs
when the action is taken by either the speaker or some third person. Note that the
pronominal verbal prefix beginning with a vowel fuses with Idal, as in example (182),
                                                   does not appear when /die/ is used, as
but the pronominal prefix, except for the final /l/,
in (184). (See Section 4.10.2.1 for a further discussion of Id=/.)
        Finally, the incorporative form occurs in verb compounding and incorporation
( 189) as well as in negative commands ( I go)-( 191). As is seen in examples ( 190) and(191), the incorporative form, when used as a negative imperative, does not occur with
any pronominal prefix. [mq] is a variant of /m@/'no, without, out o f , which is
suffixed to nouns.(189) d&b$ howa ehilese                'The door is hard to open.'

4.8.1.2. Inflectional stems
       There is considerable irregularity in the active verb inflection. However, most
of the transitive verbs in my data can be grouped into nine morphological classes
according to the shared inflectional patterns? Two of these, which I call G7 and G10
verbs are rather small classes, consisting of only a few verbs. One of the features24Throughout the discussion on the inflected forms, the verb classes are referred to
with the prefix 'G'(for 'group') followed by a number, e.g. 'G7','G5-3b'. The
classification and numbering of the verbs are first presented in Section 4.8.2.2, and a
subset of the data appears in Table 19.
which distinguish them from the other verb classes is that they contain inflectional
suffixes such as 1-01 (G7)and /-i/
                                (GlO), whereas verbs of the other classes have l-e/.
The details of the morphological classes are provided in the discussion of each inflected
form, in Sections 4.8.2 and 4.8.3, and a summary appears in Section 4.8.4.
        Transitive verbs have eight inflectional stem forms: five active and three
passive forms. Some stems consist of a root plus an inflectional suffix (e.g. perfective
suffix, potential suffix), while others are unsuffixed.u Each stem, whether suffixed or
not, is associated with some prosody (e.g. tonal melody) in the underlying
representation. For example, the potential stem form of G6 verbs has the underlying
tonal pattern /IF/,e.g. /tP61i?1[tP6?1b]'eat', and that of G8 verbs has /FF/,
                                                                            e.g. /t?Q.de/
[t?@?nj]'beat'. Since the tonal pattern is a property of each inflectional stem, tones are
not specified in the roots in the following discussion of verb inflection.
       Active verbs are inflected according to two separate paradigms: the active
paradigm and the detransitive (i.e. passive) paradigm. The active paradigm is for non-
derived intransitive verbs and the active form of transitive verbs. The detransitive
paradigm is used for derived intransitive verbs and the passive f o m of transitive verbs.","[211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"
"                        'He saw it.'
                        (tr[3sg:3has]-seelpf)
4.1.2. Verb roots
        Most verb stems consist of a single root. The vast majority of verb roots are
monosyllabic and end in an underlying consonant, which only surfaces when the root
is followed by a non-null inflectional suffix or a subordinating suffix. The possible 1As we will see in the following section, most Jemez verbs contain only one root, but
there are verbs consisting of two roots. The term 'verb stem' is used to refer to that
part of a verb to which an inflectional suffix or a subordinating suffix is attached. Thus
/@it/'string' is a verb root and also a verb stem. It is suffixed with /e/ and other
inflectional suffixes: e.g. [aitk] 'string (perfective)', [@it%]
                                                               'string (imperative)'. On the
other hand, /p')$epzy/ 'melt' is a verb stem but not a root, because it contains two roots:
/pp%/'water' and / p ~ y /'make'. Note, however, the term 'root' is used as a cover term
for both a root and a stem in the discussion of active-verb inflectional paradigms
(Sections 4.8.2 and 4.8.3) since all the verbs mentioned as examples there have a non-
compound stem: namely, they contain a single root to which an inflectional suffix is
attached.
underlying final consonants are /p, b, t, d, ty, S,I, W, y/.2 Examples of roots which
contain these consonants are provided in (3), and some surface forms of the roots in(4b3(3)     Ra-p/ 'shoot with an arrow'            P Q * ~'do,

2Many of these consonants alternate with others. For example, /b/ can surface as [b],
[m], or [p?]. This fact may give an impression that there are more root-final
consonants.
3The tone and vowel length of the root differ among inflected forms. I do not specify
the tones in the underlying segmental representation of verb roots since the tonal pattern
is associated to each inflected stem form. (See Section 4.8.1.2 for the discussion of
tones in inflectional forms.)
       Most roots can occur alone, followed only by an inflectional suffix, but there
are some bound forms which appear only in compound verbs. In (5) the first root in
each example never occurs as an independent word.                                'walk awayJimpf'               r6-ya-] 'walk', [mfl 'go'

4.1.3. Number-differentiated stems
       Some verbs have a pair of different stems whose occurrence is correlated with
the number of the S of intransitive verbs or the P of transitive verbs. There are two
types: in the first type, there is one form for the singular and dual, and a different form
for the plural. All the examples of this type are verbs of position, shown in (6) - (10).
The occurrence of different stems is independent of the inflectional categories
associated with the cited forms.","[164, 165, 166]"

4.8.3.5. Incorporative
        The incorporative form is the most variant of all the inflected forms in the
detransitive paradigm. Three types are recognized: (a) verb root only, (b) verb root
plus the suffix l-z(-)l, (c) irregular forms. Examples (237) - (240) illustrate the
incorporative stems in negative imperative constructions.",[235]

3.7.4. Double marking for possessive
        Occasionally Jemez speakers mark the possessor twice with different
mechanisms. In (106a), the possessor is marked by both a relativized verb of position
with incorporated kin term and a transitive benefactive prefix on the main verb. (106b)
shows an alternative construction with a simple transitive prefix on the main verb.
Similarly, (107a) contains a kinship verb with an intransitive prefix and an intransitive
benefactive prefix on the main verb. In (l07b), the main verb is marked by an
intransitive prefix, not an intransitive benefactive prefix.(106) a. nl.#'&?aPe ba=mfw$             'Look at my child.'

3.8. Noun qualifiers
       Jemez does not have a separate class of adjectives that is structurally distinct
from other word classes. The Jemez equivalents of adjectives found in other languages
are mostly stative verbs. In addition, there are descriptive words which cooccur with
the copula and behave like nouns. The qualification of nouns is usually done by
relativized verbs, including the copula, or by compounded noun modifiers, as we saw
in Section 3.3.
       First, let us look at the structural characteristics of stative verbs modifying
nouns. In (108a) and (109a)' the verb /N'bright' occurs as the predicate of the
sentence. In ( l OBb), (109b), and ( 109~)'it qualifies the noun /wQh~/'star', forming
an NP with the nominalizer /-?6/ which functions as the P of 'see'. The norninalized
clause shows the expected agreement with a Class I noun.""(108) a           w Q h ~pf                    'The star is bright. '

24Notethat the inverse suffix /-S/ can follow the modified noun, as in (109b), or the
nominalizer, as in (109c).
        Some descriptive words are structurally nouns (e.g. f flabe/ 'big one' rather
than 'big'), and take the copula /-%l when they occur as the predicate of the sentence,
as in ( l lOa), (1 lob), ( l l la), (l l lb). As noun modifiers, these words are foIlowed by
the copula, and the resulting clause is norninalized, as in (1 1 0 ~ )(' l lOd), ( I l lc),
( 1 l Id). These descriptive words can take the inverse suffix, just like nouns. In ( l lob)and (l lOd), the noun is inverse, so rilzbe] is followed by the inverse suffix 1-31. The
same is true of [khyflin ( l l l b) and (l l Id).(110) a.         khy@?n$

These quantifiers form antonyrnous pairs in which one term means having a large
degree of some attribute, and the other a small degree of that attribute, such as 'long'   -
'short', 'heavy'   - 'lightweight', and 'deep' - 'shallow'. In many cases, the words
                                are stative verbs. In (127a), the paired quantifiers
modified by Mz/, /y&-1,and /khyb*/
precede the verbs in a phrasal collocation. In ( l 27b), on the other hand, the quantifiers
are bound to morphemes whose meanings are difficult to determine. h e / and /le/,for
example, do not occur in any other words of this type in my data.","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"

IKiowa is the only Plains Indian tribe in this group. The others all share Pueblo
cultural traits. All the Tanoan languages are spoken in New Mexico, and a dialect of
Tewa is also spoken in Arizona.
        Kenneth Hale collected Jemez data in 1956 and 1957. Some of his data
appeared in three published works? Hale (1962) presents evidence from Jemez to
support a genetic relationship between Kiowa and Tanoan languages, which was
suggested by other researchers, including Harrington (1910b). In this paper, Hale
provides sound correspondences between Jernez and Kiowa. In addition, he very
briefly mentions similarities in the verbal prefix paradigms and the noun classification
systems between the two languages.
        Hale (1967) is an attempt to reconstruct the stem-initial consonants and partially
the vowels in Proto Kiowa-Tanoan. In the course of reconstruction, he describes
morphophonemic consonant ablaut, which appears in all the Kiowa-Tanoan languages.
AIthough it is a historical study, it also contains synchronic data on Jemez phonology,
such as tones, stress, and the phonological process which he calls 'depalatalization'.
       In HaIe (1972), he advocates a more active involvement of American Indians in
linguistic research, and by way of illustrating the merit of such an effort, he provides
some morphosyntactic data on Jemez, such as passive voice and noun incorporation.
       Constance Martin (1964) briefly discusses tones and syllables, and provides a
detailed description of Jemez sounds. However, its scope is limited to (classical)
phonemics: she derives the consonant and vowel phonemes by checking if particular
sounds 'contrast' in analogous environments. She overlooks the fact that some
consonants have a very limited but systematic distribution, and as a result, she comes
up with more consonant 'phonemes' than necessary.
       Beatrice Myers and Hazel Shorey studied Jemez during the 19603, and Myers
wrote a master's thesis on the 'phrase structure' of the language (Myers 1970). She

which he provides concise information about Jemez phonology and morphology. The
notes also contain a vocabulary list.
discusses 'Noun Phrase', 'Verb Phrase', 'Location Phrase', and 'Time Phrase', but
she tends to describe only the sequence of words in particular phrases without giving
adequate morphological information. Like Martin (1964), her phoneme inventory is
based on the classical phonemic approach. She does not indicate tones or stress in her
phonetic transcription. In addition to the discussion of phrases, Myers provides a
vocabulary list and the transcription of three informal talks.
        Laurel Watkins presented papers on aspects of Jemez phonology and verbal
morphology at linguistic conferences (Watkins 1990a & 1990b).
        Robert Sprott's 1992 doctoral dissertation ""Jemez Syntax"" includes
phonological and morphological analysis. Among the morpho-syntactic topics covered
are the passive and incorporation. In addition, he provides a detailed analysis of Jemez
pronominal prefixes in the framework of relational grammar. The most elaborated part
of his work is the interlinear annotation of three biblical stories, as retold in Jemez by a
Jemez man. Sprott's phoneme inventory is similar to mine, but there is a considerable          '
difference in our treatments of suprasegmentals. In fact, he did not undertake the
analysis of tones.
        There are three instrumental studies of Jemez phonetics. Alan Bell (1992)
discusses some issues related to Jemez prosody, including tones and stress. Rebecca
Heins (1993) provides formant values for the Jemez vowel system. Heins (1994) is an
MA thesis on the stop consonants in Jernez.
       In addition to the works cited above, I presented at linguistic conferences a
series of papers that deal with aspects of Jemez morphology and syntax. In Yurnitani
(1988a)' I first suggested that Jemez actually has four noun classes-three     classes of
count nouns and one class of mass nouns-just      like the other Kiowa-Tanoan
language^.^ I elaborated on my findings on noun classes in another paper (Yumitani
1988b) by providing three types of evidence: ( l ) the distribution of the inverse number
suffix /-S/; (2) CO-referentialpronominal prefixes to the verb; and (3) demonstratives.","[19, 20, 21, 22]"

                        CHAPTER 3. NOUN MORPHOLOGY
3.0. Introduction
       Nouns are one of the two major word classes in Jemez. They participate in an
elaborate number-based classification system. Many of them are inflected for number
and take an inflectional suffix. The choice of demonstratives is determined by the
number and class of nouns. These characteristics define them as the class of nouns. A
general introduction to the Jemez noun classification system is given in Section 3.4.1.
pronominal prefixes in Section 3.4.2, and dernonstratives in Section 3.5.
       All the examples in this and the next chapters are surface forms except when the
underlying representation is relevant, in which case both the surface and underlying
forms are provided. (The underlying forms are enclosed between slashes / /.)
3.1. Roots and stems
       Stems typically consist of a single root (l),a root and a suffix (2), or more than
one root (3). Most noun stems contain one to three syllables; disyllabic stems are the
most common.(1)        'tongue'           @ti'feather, fur'       khYk 'crow'
(2)    ?@?e'sugar'             b&tasa3e 'glue'        (cf. /-W 'nominalizer')
(3)    ?ip% 'blood'            (Pg 'blood' + /p?&/ 'water, liquid')
       khyfda.ba='cradle'      (/khyi/'child' + /db-b$/ 'board')       The great majority of noun roots can occur freely.(4)    p&- 'deer'             p@ 'drum'               befa 'bread'There are a few bound roots, some of which are shown in (5).

                                pfbida: 'cotton ball'
3.2. Derivation
        The most common source of derived nounsis verbs. Two main mechanisms
derive nouns from verbs: (a) derivation from the incorporative form of verbs, and (b)
derivation with a nominalizing suffix. (See Section 4.8.3.5 for the discussion of
incorporative forms.)
3.2.1. Derivation from the incorporative form of verbs
        Some nouns derived from the incorporative form of verbs do not change their
shapes. (See Section 2.5.5.) Phonologically, the tonal patterns in the nouns and verbs
are the same in many cases, as in (6)' but sometimes the derived nouns have different
tones from the original verb stems, as in (7) below.

        In terms of classical phonemics, there appears to be a four-way contrast among
stops in Jemez. The presence of [th]especially among the alveolar stops makes the
contrast look as if it is four-way. In other places of articulation, however, there are at
most three stops: for example, among the palatalized and non-palatalized velar stops,
there is no aspirated vs. (voiceless) unaspirated contrast. Thus the actual contrast
among stops is three-way: ejectives, voiceless stops, and voiced stops. [th]is often
pronounced as [q.The voiced stops, [b], [d] , [g] ,are often devoiced in the
pronunciation of some speakers.
        [ty] is a voiceless unaspirated palatal stop. Some speakers pronounce it as a
slightly affricated [E] before [i] : e.g. [tYisala]([Eisalae]) 'lizard'. Note that [Eh]is
always forcefully articulated, while the variant [E] of [ty]is not. ([P] and [Eh]are
                                   respectively, in most cases, and 01 comes from
derived from underlying ka/and /khY/,
underlying /gY/or /S/.)
        The glottal stop r ] can phonetically occur word-initially, intervocalically, and
word-finally before a pause. There are some minimal pairs involving words which
begin with a glottal stop and words which have an initial [fi]: e.g. r g 'blood',   [fia
'cedar tree' .3
        [+] is usually labialized, thus phonetically   [v].[fJ only occurs in loan words.
[S]and [z] have the variants [g] and [a], respectively. Their distributions are not clear:
e.g. [WC-sC]or [wC86] '(water) spring'; [zS3e] or [6EPe] 'mother'. Furthermore,
people of younger generations tend to replace the initial [S]of syllables carrying low
tone with [h], e.g. pronominal prefix [hq-] (for [SQ-l),passive imperfective suffix
[-aha] (for [-asa]).
        [fi] appears in root-initial position.
        U] occurs word-initially only in Spanish loanwords.
        [t] has a rather limited distribution. It alternates with [h] in some environments,
such as after some pronominal prefixes, through a phonological process called 'L-
effect': e.g. [qhk-rna 'you (sg) are running away', [rn@-rnj] 'you (du) are running'In addition to the presence or absence of a glottal stop, there is also a difference in

the discussion of 'L-effect' in Section 2.5. l for the details.)
        [r] is a voiced alveolar flap, and occurs only in loanwords from Spanish.
        The sonorants [l] , [m] ,[n] , [y] ,and [W]have glottalized counterparts rl],
rm] , ['n] ,ry] ,and rw] . The segments in the latter set all have a limited distribution,
and all but [?l] only occur at the beginning of the final syllable of a word, i.e. not at the
beginning of a stem. rl] ,on the other hand, can occur in the stem-initial position as
well as in the last syllable. All these glottalized sonorants are derived from their plain
counterparts by phonological rules. (See Section 2.5.3.)
2.1.2. Underlying consonants
        Some of the surface consonants only occur in surface forms and are derived
from some underlyingly different consonants. They are: [th], [E?], [Eh],[n, [l]?rl], rm],
rn], ['y], and rw], and except for [ P ] ,they never occur at the beginning of words3
All the underlying consonants of Jemez are given in Table 2.","[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

        Consonant alternations of this type are not predictable since only some
consonants which derived from certain consonants in Proto-Kiowa-Tanoan are
invoIved. Thus the words which contain these consonants must be so indicated in the
lexicon.41
2.5.6. Reduplication
        Redupiication is used in the formation of the imperfective form of some verbs.
The entire CV syllable of a monosyllabic root or the final syllable (CV) of a
polysyllabic verb root in a compound is copied and attached to the end of the original
root. If the original syllable carries a high tone, the vowel of the reduplicated syllable is
lengthened and carries a F tone, but if it carries an underlying falling tone, the vowel of
the reduplicated syllable is short with a L tone.","[77, 78]"
"
2.5.3. Glottalization
        As we have already seen, Jernez has both glottaiized sonorants and glottalized
obstments (ejectives). The glottalized sonorants, with the exception of rl] which also
occurs in non-final syllabIes, occur only at the beginning of a word-final short syllable
carrying an underlying F tone (i.e. surface M) within the same stem (i.e. not root-
initially) and are derived from underlyingly non-glottalized sonorants. This consonant
alternation occurs in both nouns and verbs. Examples of nouns are shown in (47).             .(47)    d6?li             'chicken'      C   /dew

        ?&?W&             'shoulder      < &WE/        The glottalization of obstruents as well as sonorants occurs systematically in
some inflectional stems of verbs. The glottalized consonants are often found in the
perfective form, in active or passive voice, the imperative, and the active potential, and
their non-glottalized counterparts occur in other forms, including the imperfective. In
this case also, glottalization is caused by an underlying F tone in the following word-
final syllable.(48)                                     tive

        The alternation of glottalized and non-glottalized consonants is also found in a
few demonstratives, in which case the glottalized consonant is associated with the
inverse number, while its non-glottalized counterpart indicates the basic number.(49)    a.      ni.dagYid&                'this pot, these potslbas (sg/pl)'

resultant consonants are shown in (52), and the formaI rule which accounts for
glottalization in nouns and verbs is given in (53). Note that the rule does not apply to
root-initial consonants or to voiced velar stop /gY/.

2.5.4. Verb-root-final consonant alternation in the imperfective form
       There is one more type of alternation which involves medial consonants (i.e.
verb-root-final consonant) in some verb stems. The alternating pairs are as follows:(SS)   a.             P - ""
       b.             t - l
       C.             ty   -S
The first consonant in each pair occurs in perfective and other perfective-based forms,
while the alternating consonants appear in the imperfective form.*(56)                  Perfective   Immrfective
       a              gYf@         gY@e             'bend'
                      S&pe         S&ve             'shoot (with arrow)'
                      aSipe        mfgive           'rub'
       b.             yktk         y%Ie             'throw'
                      Qnctk          le             'string'
                      7e.e         '&le             'run'40Actually, the alternation between [ty]and [S] is found in the stem-initial position,
too-in the word for 'fall off/pf: [tYaand [Sq. The first form occurs when S (i.e.
intransitive subject) is plural, while the second one when S is singular or dual (for noun
classes I, XI, and m).It is not clear whether this particular alternation is systematic
since this is the only such example I have. (See Section 4.1.3 for a related discussion.)

2.5.5. Verb-root-initial consonant ablaut         One frequently mentioned ""family feature"" of Kiowa-Tanoan languages is what
HaIe (1967: 1 13) describes as ""the rnorphophonemic ablauting of certain verb stem-
initial consonants under specific morphosyntactic conditions."" In Jemez, three such
conditions are identified: (a) verb compounding and incorporation; (b) nominalization;
(c) detransitivization (i.e. formation of intransitive verbs from transitive verbs of similar
semantic content such as 'open/intransitive' and 'opedtransitive' ). The consonants
which alternate under these conditions are listed in (57). The first consonant in each
pair is the basic one, that is, the one which occurs in environments other than these
three.(57)     m    - p
         n - t
         t3   - S
         ka      khY         f i - hNote that not all verbs which contain initial [t3]and [m] exhibit the alternation.
According to Hale (1967: 117), only the [t7]and [m] which derive from Proto-Kiowa-
Tanoan *c? and *b, respectively, participate in the ablauting. He mentions two
                                        -          -
additional consonant alternations, It7/ /t/ and P/ /khy/,but they are only found in the
                                                       -                         -
examples of verb roots which he cites: / t 7 e / /tz-/'to grind', /)a/ /khe-/ 'to bathe'
(19679 17).
       Specific examples of consonant alternations under each morphosyntactic
condition are provided below.","[71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]"

1.3.2. Linguistic data in ethnographic and other studies        Some ethnographic and historical studies contain Jemez vocabulary. Elsie
Clews Parsons conducted field work at Jemez PuebIo in 192 1 and 1922. Parsons
( 1925) is an ethnography of the Jemez and includes, among other things, a descriptionof the kinship system, ceremonial life, and personal life. The book contains many
Jemez words, some of which are now archaic and are not recognized by present-day
Jemez speakers. Parsons' phonetic transcription of Jemez words is probably the best
among the three ethnographers cited here. It marked nasalized vowels and glottalized
consonants. Her transcription of long vowels, however, is inconsistent, and she did
not mark tones at all. Although there are inaccurate transcriptions, her ethnography is
noteworthy in that it contains some phonologically and morphologically interesting
facts. (See Section 2.3.1.)
        Blanche Harper (1929) contains a long vocabulary list (41 pages), arranged
according to various categories, including clans, religious terms, numbers, time terms,
directions, and relationships. She uses a modified English spelling in transcribing3Hale mentions two classes of count nouns in his unpublished ""Notes on Jemez
Grammar."" His vocabulary list contains what appear to be mass nouns.
words, and the meanings of some symbols, including an accent mark,are not clear.
Many consonants, especially stops, are incorrectly recorded.
       Sarah Cook (1930) contains 54 native botanical terms, but there are many
inaccurate transcriptions.
       Joe Sando (1982) presents the history of Jemez Pueblo, and contains some
Jernez personal and place names, written in English spelling, along with their English
glosses.","[22, 23]"
"In the same presentation, I provided a list of examples for each of the four noun
classes. I also discussed the on-going reanalysis of the suffix /-S/ by Jemez speakers.
(See Section 3.4.2 for the details.) Yumitani (1990) provides a general account of
noun incorporation in Jemez, and compares it with its Isleta (Southern Tiwa)
counterpart.",[22]
"
42Logically the progressive form of 'go' would be expected here, but it is the perfective
form which occurs as an inflectional auxiliary.

change of the underlying vowel /z/in the stem-fmal syllable. The suffix Piel has a
tone-lowering effect on disyllabic verb stems: the H tone of the final syllable of the
verb is changed to L, as shown in (3 1I) and (312). (See Section 2.4.3.7 for
morphological tone lowering.)(3 1 1) h6dk qgYida?ae          'Watch out! He might bury you.'

result in the nasalization of the verb-root final consonant (/d/ or /b/). As was noted in
Section 2.5.2of Chapter 2, the nasalized vowel in the preceding syllable causes [a]to
be nasalized within the same stem, but not [ae].(3 13) h6dk qpQ*mq3a=           'Watch out! He might slap you.'

4.8.4. Morphological classes of verbs        As we have seen, the inflection of Jemez verbs is quite complex; there is much
irregularity. It does not seem possible to derive all the inflected forms from a single
underlying form. However, most of the transitive verbs in my data fall into nine
classes according to their inflectional pattems. The tonal patterns and inflectional
properties of verbs in these classes are shown in Table 20. Only the inflected forms in
the active paradigm are included, since the inflection in the detransitive paradigm is
regular.
        In all verbs except those in G7, G8,G9-2,and G10,there is a correspondence
in tonal patterns between the active perfective and active potential sterns: if one of them
carries a H tone in the second syllable of a disyllabic stem or the only syllable of a
monosy~labicstem, the other carries a F tone. There is also a connection between the
incorporative stem and the perfective and potential stems: if the perfective and potential
are unsuffixed, the incorporative, too, is unsuffixed; if suffixed, the incorporative
contains the same suffix as the perfective and potential.
Table 20. Morphological classes of verbs               Potn           Pf              Im~f   m               FinalC
Potn, Pf: The syllable structure and tones of the verb roots are not included for G10
           verbs since the two examples in my data are different in the number of
           syllables.
Impf: 'R' means that these classes have reduplicated forms; '(C)-e' in G9-2 means that
           the root-final consonant alternates with another consonant in the
           imperfective.
m    1    '0' means that these verbs are unsuffixed. There is irregularity in the
           incorporative form of G8 verbs, e.g. [zf] 'catch, touch', [sir-nfl'beat',
           [tYQ*nqJ
                 'cook'.
Final C = verb root-final consonants
        The passive stems (i.e. perfective, potentid, imperfective) have the same tonal
pattern, except for a small subset of G5-3a verbs.
        The verbs in G7 and G10 contain a different consonant (i.e. /b/)in the final
syllable of the passive stems: e.g. [kw5*?yb]
                                           'feed/pf'    - [kw6-p7i]'feed/psv.pf , [pij.ni-]
'slaplpf'   - [p@pTz]'slap/psv.pf'. ([ntjpiyt.] 'teachlpf has two passive perfective
forms-[nQpi3yk] and [nQpip3k]--of which the former is more common.)
        It is quite possible that there are more verb classes. Table 19 lists 19 groups,
and many of them may turn out to be valid classes. However, only nine of them can be
identified as inflectional classes with some certainty. Groups other than these nine
contain too few examples or irregularity within them. For instance, there are at least
two types found in the imperative forms of Gl-l verbs (e.g. [mfwi] 'see', [SG-wi]
'break something') and the incorporative forms of G1-2 verbs (e.g.[m&se] 'give', [hq
'kill'). G2-1 consists of only one verb, [m/.]
                                             'bring (pf/potn)', in my data.
        Sprott (1992) claims that the full paradigm of most verbs can be obtained if we
know four stem forms, i.e. active perfective, active imperfective, passive perfective,
passive imperfective. He writes that ""These four forms must simply be memorized;
there is no sure way of getting from one to any of the other three"" (1 992: 144), and he
seems to suggest that the other three stems in the active paradigm, i.e. imperative,
potential (his 'optative'), and incorporative ('negative imperative'), can all be derived
from the perfective (1992: 148-149). The difference between my conclusions and
Sprott's on verb inflection may be attributed to three factors. First, I have paid close
attention to tones and grouped verbs into 19 classes according to the tonal patterns of
the potential and perfective stems. Second, I have analyzed systematically the
                                           -
alternation between consonants: e.g. [b] [m]     - [p?], [d] - [n] - [t?], and determined
their phonological conditions while setting up a single underlying consonant from
which the other(s) can be derived. Third, I have proposed the analysis that most verbs
have an underlying root-final consonant.
        My preliminary conclusion on transitive active verb inflection is as follows: to
obtain the full paradigm of a verb, we need to have five pieces of information on a
verb, (a) the morphological class of the verb, (b) the verb root, (c) the active perfective
stem, (d) the detransitive (passive) stem, and (e) the active imperative form. The active
potential stem is predictable from the active perfective stem in all but four classes, and
three of the the four are small classes. The (active) incorporative stem, at least the
segmental shape, of verbs except those in G8,can be predicted from the perfective.
The imperfective stem is also predictable if we know the verb root-final consonant and
the tonal pattern of the perfective stem, except for verbs in the small classes of G7, G9-
2, G10.
       Inflection in the detransitive paradigm is regular, and it is possible to derive the
perfective, imperfective and potential forrns from a single detransitive stem with an
underlying tonal pattern, namely, we would not have to list the passive perfective and
imperfective forms. The only difference between the passive and active stems is the
tonal pattern, and the vast majority of verbs have regular, predictable tones (m/or
/ID?/>in the passive stem, so if we only know which verbs of G5-3a have anomalous
tones, we can obtain the passive paradigm of all transitive verbs. (See Section
4.8.3.1.)
       It might even be possible to derive all the inflected stems, including the
imperative, from one underlying verb root as long as the class membership of the verb
is known. However, we still need to work out the details of verb classes before we can
determine the validity of such a claim. A complete paradigm for each of the nine verb
classes is provided in Appendix 4 ""Transitive verb paradigms.""
4.8.5. Stative verbs
4.8.5.1. Introduction
        Stative verbs lack a perfective/imperfective opposition altogether, and most of
them have only one basic form. The verbs are grouped into three types on the basis of
whether they have inflected stems other than the basic one, and if they do, how many.
The first type, which consists of only three verbs in my data, have two forms (basic
and potential). The second type, which contains four stative verbs, have three (basic,
potential, incorporative). The third type is most numerous and has only the basic form.
The details of these types are pr~videdin the following sections.
        Verbs in the basic form are interpreted as refening to a state or condition which
exists at the time of utterance or existed at some reference time in the past. If the
sentence does not contain any time adverb or any other tense marker, the tense is
indeterminate.(241) howa WQ?Q                 'He is (very) kind.'
        howa 0-W@               (very intr[3bas]-kind/stat)
(242) nQ.Sipaya i%              'I am a potter.'
        no*gipaya P 2           (potter intr[l sgl-cop/stat)

(244) w&mf                      'He wantdwanted it.'
        0-wti-mf                (intr[3bas]-wantfstat)        To indicate that the state does not exist any more, the inflectional suffixes I-@/
'past habitual' m d 1-?%*l
                        'unfulfilled' are added to the basic stative form. (See Section
4.8.6 for the inflectional suffkes.)

                                 'He used to be strong.'

                                 'I used to be a potter.'
                                (potter intr[ l sgl-cop/stat-past)

4.8.5.2. Stative verbs with two inflected stems       There are only three verbs of this type in my data. They have separate basic and
potential stems. Basic stems are illustrated in (250)-(252).","[235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"
"SMartin (1964) concurs with the absence of [c] and [C.].
        All short oral vowels, when they occur word-finally, may have a breathy
release. Particularly, the high front vowel [i] is often accompanied by [h] or [c]
                                                  -         -
phonetically when pronounced in isolation: [kwi] [kwih] [kwiq]'joint'.
        [e] is sometimes pronounced with a y off-glide, especially word-medially when
the following syllable contains a low vowel: [vsth]   - [veYth]'thigh', [s&$b]- [sky@]
'eyelash'.
          is pronounced as a high back rounded vowel [U]after [@land [W]:e.g.
        [i]
[cp""Q3u](C/af/)'flea, louse'. It is pronounced as a centralized unrounded [i]
elsewhere?
                                                                                           '
        [o] is pronounced as a mid back vowel [o]. However, two of the speakers I
interviewed use a slightly higher vowel after a palatal or palatalized consonant [W]or
[U]: e.g. [tY6]([tyir]) 'girl'; [khy6*]
                                     ([khyi9-l)'kidneyY.7
        [a] has two principal variants, rounded [D] and unrounded [a]. Although the
former is more common, their distribution is not clear. This vowel is often followed by
a y off-glide when a high vowel occurs in the following syllable: e.g. [@@PE]    -
[@6Ypi'l%]
        'peach'.
       Vowels are nasalized after a nasal consonant, perceptually more so for non-high
vowels than for high vowels, and this poses a problem in determining the underlying
forms. Phonetically nasalized vowels which occur in words without a nasal consonant,
                 'apricot', can be safely treated as underlyingly nasalized. However,
such as [WO-pi21%]
nasalized vowels found in a nasalization environment, e.g. [i] in [sblamj] 'he/she is
running', can be marked as either oral or nasalized in underlying representation because6Some speakers, particularly male, consistently pronounce it as a rounded vowel in all
environments. [U]never contrasts with [i],but it contrasts with [o]: e.g. [@fi.se7ra]
 'yucca plant', [@*l61 'head-hair'.
'Laurel Watkins (personal communication) reports that younger consultants use [U]
after [i] and the palatalized velar stops. Sprott's (1992) data also show this
distribution.
the contrast between oral and nasalized vowels is neutralized in this environment. The
more troublesome case is where a vowel appears to be nasalized as a result of nasality
spread from an adjacent syllable: e.g. riwQ] 'you (sg)'; [sjyfl 'rain/impf . I will mark
underlying nasalized vowels as nasalized whether or not they are adjacent to nasal
2.2.2. Vowel length
        Long vowels can occur in any syllable of a word. (There are some restrictions
on the appearance of long vowels with some tones. See Section 2.4.1 for the details.)
At the end of words, some long vowels have short variants (e.g. [&IQ.] - [@IQ]
'backbone, spine'), while others systematically alternate with a short vowel followed
by a glottal stop plus another vowel of the same qualiy (VV). The latter is found
before a pause? The tone on the long vowels which exhibit this alternation is either
falling or low: e.g. [$-l   - [@Pi]'smoking', [bide-]- [bida:?a:] 'jack rabbit'. The
sequences of Pv]
               and [TV]are analyzed here as long vowels with a falling tone in
underlying representation. (See Section 2.4.1 for discussion.)
        On the other hand, the long vowels which can be shortened without any
apparent pattern are considered to be long with a high tone underlyingly. Such vowels
only occur in compounding and incorporation (nouns and verbs). (See Section 2.4.1BNasality normally spreads from left to right, but there are isolated cases where it
affects preceding syllables. Compare the first vowel in the following two phrases:
[h~wq.di.y6mW+?i]'you (sg) used to be quiet' (uttered in fast speech, underlyingly
Ihowa q-dfiyombg/); [howa rn~di.yorn~rn~?~]     'you (du) used to be quiet'. [o] in
[howa] is usually not nasalized (e.g. [howa ?Q?Q]'it is sweet'); it becomes nasalized
only when nasality spreads from the following syllable.
9In more carefbl speech, the glottal stop, occurring in pre-pause position, is normally
followed by an 'echo' vowel-the vowel preceding the glottal stop is copied after the
glottal stop, and is pronounced with a low tone or with no voicing. At a normal rate of
speech, on the other hand, there is usually no echo vowel after the glottal stop.
for the relation between tones and vowel length, and Section 2.5.15 for the shortening
of long vowels.)
        Short vowels with falling tone, except for high nasalized vowels [I, i], are
slightly lengthened when they appear in the initial syllable of polysyllabic words: e.g.
[mi)] 'finger'   - [ma-te] 'hand'; [p%] 'mountain' - [p%?-pb]'mountain trout'. The
lengthening of short vowels with F tone also occurs in phrases (e.g. noun phrases
involving a quantifier): e.g. [W? se] 'two eyes' (lwil 'two, Is61 'eye'). In this
lengthening environment, contrast in vowel length is lost.","[35, 36, 37, 38]"

2.5.8. Velar Stop Depalatalization        The distribution of palatalized and non-palatalized velar stops is generally
predictable. Palatalized velar stops normally occur at the beginning of a stem-initial
syllable, which is always stressed except for some loanwords.42 The palatalized stops
become depalatalized: (a) when the stops are preceded by benefactive prefixes; (b)in
'small degree' words; and (c) in loanwords, such as [gtiiwe] 'Kiowa'; [ga@] 'coffee';
[gisenq] 'kitchen'; [khm&*tg]
                            'bed'; [kh66e]'cabbage'. The 'small degree' words refer
to words such as [kh61e%] 'be small', [kh6*kwQ*nq]'be thin', [kh6*tQ] 'be short', and
contrast in meaning with [yikbe ?h] 'be big', [yh*kwij*nq]'be thick', [y&*tQ] 'be long'.
(For the details, see Section 3.9 of Chapter 3.)
        The occurrence of the non-palatalized velar stops after benefactive prefixes was
first noted by Hale ( 1967: 120):
        Jernez velar consonants are normally palatalized when they appear initially in
        stressed stems where the latter are unaccompanied by prefixes . . . . With some
        exceptions, velars in unstressed stems are depalatalized, e.g., k ' a l is F'a] in
        P w k ' d a child exists for me,I have a child and /go*/is [go] in PiI-kfgo-l
        . . . In stressed stems following paradigmatic prefixes, the situation is as
        follows: velars are palatalized following prefixes of the 'non-benefactive'
        paradigms, and they are depalatalized following 'benefactive' prefixes.","[78, 79, 80]"
"          L-effect may operate across a word boundary, though very rarely. Sprott
(1992:38) writes that in this environment, ""speakers seem to have a great deal of
freedom as to whether to articulate the N or not."" He notes that other than across clause
boundaries and when a 'phonetically empty' prefix (i.e. a null prefix), e.g. intransitive
prefix with a third person singular S, occurs after /V, the choice is free (1992:39).
Except in the speech of one female speaker, however, L-effect in my data does not take
place if the following word begins with a consonant, whether it is a pronominal prefix,
a particle, or a lexical stem (noun or verb). If /l/
                                                   precedes a vowel-initial pronominal
prefix, N always shows up. However, this is an instance of cliticization rather than L-
effect.
          L-effect changes consonants of various types. The consonants resulting from
L-effect can be grouped into three types-(non-glottalized) alveolar stops, alveopalatal
affricates, and laterals.",[65]

2.4.3.6. Variation in tone rules
        One type of variation is found with respect to the Non-initial Root H Lowering
rule. A H tone is normally lowered after the initial root, but in a smdl number of
lexical items, lowering can occur after the first syllable of the initial root. This is
especially common in noun incorporation.(24)    a       zi5tabela        'tarnale'          c /z6t6/ 'posole' + /b86/ 'bread'30
        b.      khyjinpmk        'selllpf'          C /khybQ/ 'trade'      + /m&/ 'givelpf
        C.      tib6layatk       'I threw bread.'
                                             < /ti-b6l&-yikte/ (W[ l sg:unsp]-bread-throwlpf)
        d.      taMlafii         'I killed a bear.'
                                               /ta-@k16-H/   (&[lsg:3bas]-bear-kill/pf)
Considering that in (24b)and (24d) the H tone in the second syllable of the initial root
is lowered when followed by another root beginning with short F, one might set up a
tone rule to lower a H to L when it occurs between H and M (i.e. an underlying F).
However, HHM (cHH + F) is a common tone sequence in compounds.30cf. [Silkbela] 'corn tortilla' c lSflh/      'round' + /bbl6/ 'bread'.
(25)    ka$lk@          '(blue) sage'   < /k%lk/ 'Navajo' + /W/ 'weed'
        @ie*kw6t%       'firewood'      c /@k*kw6/ 'fireplace'   + /tYi5/ 'wood'        The Non-initial Root H Lowering rule has another type of variation. F tone in
non-stem-initial position is normally lowered to M. In a few long compounds
consisting of five syllables, F is realized as a lowered F in surface representation.

2.4.3.7. Morphological tone lowering
        The second syllable with H tone in disyllabic verb stems is lowered to L before
suffixes P$/ 'conditional-temporal, admonitive' and P&/ 'nominalizer'.(27)    a.            'when he woke up'

                               (that man door-inv tr[3sg:3inv]-close/pf-nom)
31In addition to the tone lowering, the vowel /z/ in this syllable changes to [a], too.

2.5. Consonant alternations and phonological rules
       One of the most prominent features of Jemez phonology is the alternation of
consonants through phonological processes. The underlying consonants and the
derived surface consonants are listed below, with the name of the process given after
each surface consonant.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]"

3.6. Independent personal pronouns
        Jemez has independent personal pronouns for first and second person. There
are separate forms for second-person singulai and duallplural, like Class I nouns. Both
first and second person take the inverse suffix 1-51 for dual and plural. For first person
dud and plural, there is an exclusive/inclusivedistinction.

the reference of the arguments of the predicate since they are encoded by the
pronominal prefix attached to the verb. (See Section 4.6 of Chapter 4 for pronominal
prefixes .)(65)    khyge~?iS~-r@~a= 'when we were small'
        khY6S e=-?e-n-@-?ik      (youngjchild-inv in&[ lpl]-coplstat-past-cond)       is also the root for 'you'.

3.7. Possessive
       Jemez does not have a separate set of possessive pronouns or affixes.
Possessive-marking involves three main mechanisms: benefactive prefixes (intransitive
and transitive), intransitive prefixes, or independent personal pronouns.","[139, 140, 141, 142]"

denote the transfer of an object but which do not specify the direction of the transfer.
With [m&], A is the source of the transfer and P is the recipient, not the transferred?

transitive.","[176, 177, 178]"

2.4. Suprasegmentals
2.4.1. Surface tones and their distribution        Jemez uses pitch differences for lexical and grammatical contrast. At the
surface level, there are four tones: High (H), Low (L), Falling (F), and Mid (M). H is
represented by [' ] above a vowel, F by [""I, M by I'1, and L is unmarked.
Phonetically, H and L are level. F has an onset lower in pitch than that for H, and it is
followed by a quick drop in pitch. F on a short vowel starts at an even lower pitch than
F on a long vowel. M is generally level, but sometimes it has a short downglide. Its
onset is perceptually close to that of F.
        The distribution of tones relative to positions within words differs between
native Jemez words and Spanish loanwords. To summarize the differences: in
Spanish loanwords, (a) L tone can occur in an initial syllable in polysyllabic stems; (b)
F tone is found in non-initial syllables; (c) a L-tone syllable may be followed by a H-

19In a small set of verbs, [v] systematically alternates with [p] in inflection: e.g. [gyipe]
'bend/pf, potn, inc', [gyfve]'bendimpf"". In the verb for 'enter', [z] occurs stem-

in perfective and imperative stems.
tone syllable; (d) the initial syllable of a lexical stem may or may not be stressed. In the
following discussion, some Spanish loanwords are included to illustrate the
differences, but only data from native words are considered to describe the surface
tonal patterns.
        All four surface tones occur in monosyllabic words and affixes (pronominal
prefixes and some suffixes), although M tone is very rare.20 H,F, and L appear on
both short and long vowels. M tone is only associated with long vowels.","[45, 46]"

                         CHAPTER 4. VERB MORPHOLOGY
4.0. Introduction
        Verbs in Jemez are defined as those words which are inflected for aspect, mood
and transitivity and which occur with pronominal prefixes. In addition to words which
denote actions and processes, most of the words which would be treated as 'adjectives'
in other languages belong to this class. (See Section 3.8 'Noun qualifiers'.)
        There are two classes of verbs: transitive and intransitive. Transitive verbs are
obligatorily detransitivized (i.e. passivized) under certain syntactic conditions, and this
is reflected in the inflectional paradigm and the pronominal prefixes which they take. It
is also possible to classify verbs as active or stative. All active verbs have at least five
inflected forms, while most stative verbs have just one basic form.
        Jemez verbs are quite complex phonologically. Some consonants alternate, and
                                                                                               .
tones and vowel length vary with particular inflectional categories. For this reason,
there is a greater coverage of phonological phenomena in this chapter than in the
preceding chapter on noun morphology. The discussion of verbs in this chapter centers
around three main topics: (a) stem formation (Section 4.1 through 4.4), (b) pronominal
prefixes (Section 4.6), and (c) inflection (Section 4.8).
        Unless stated otherwise, the citation forms of verbs found in the text (and many
examples) of this chapter are the perfective form for active verbs and the basic form for
stative verbs. This is necessitated by the fact that the surface forms of Jemez verbs can
be very different from the underlying forms due to various phonological processes.
4.1. Stems
4. l. l . Constituents of the verb
        The verb may consist of up to six parts: (a) pronominal prefix, (b) negative
prefix /W&/, (c) incorporated element(s), adverb, noun or verb, (d) verb stem, (e)
inflectional suffix(es), and (f) subordinating suffix.1 The constituents of verbs are
schematically shown in (1).","[162, 163, 164]"

 TWO phonological rules are involved in the derivation of some of the detransitive
perfective forms. /ae/ changes to [e] after /W/,/y/ and /ty/through the a:Raising rule.
(This rule also applies to the derivation of the detransitive potential form, discussed in
the next section.) The root-final /b/and Id/, when occurring before [g], change to [p?]
and [P], respectively, by the application of the Glottalization rule, which requires the
presence of a F tone in the following syllable. (The gIottalization is also found in the
active perfective form.) Note that a nasalized vowel does not cause these consonants to
change to [m] and [n], respectively, when they are followed by the vowel /ad of the
perfective suffix. (See Sections 2.5.12 ( E Raising), 2.5.3 (Glottalization) and 2.5.2.2
(Nasalization) for the details of the phonological rules.)

the detransitive potential form is a more common way of expressing a command. (See
Section 4.8.2.4.)(229) dae p7i.ye?e               'Get wet.'

        d z khyh~ty%*            (opt dream/detr.potn)        The detransitive potential forms of two transitive verbs, i.e. [h&sk-]'bite' and
[h&pk] 'bake', are also used in giving a command. In this case, the A is second
person (i.e. the person ordered to perform an action), and the P is third person (i.e. the

object acted upon). The verb takes an intransitive prefix which encodes the patient. As
discussed in Section 4.7 'Passivization', passivization is normally not possible when
the A is first or second person. The use of the detransitive potentiai form in an
imperative construction is an apparent exception to this principle.(231) a.          pG3B e h & s S a        'Bite the apple (Class Q.'

cases where the corresponding perfective form does not end in a root-final /p/, N, or /tYl
plus perfective suffix. As was explained in Section 2.5.6, the initial consonant and
vowel of the verb root is reduplicated, i.e., a syllable with the canonical shape of CV or
CV* is added to the root. The tone and vowel length of the added syllable depend on
those of the source syllable: if the original syllable carries a H tone, the added syllable
contains a long vowel with underlying F tone; if the original syllable has a F tone, the
reduplicated syllable has a short vowel with a L tone. Except for verbs in G5-3, the
tone of the reduplicated root is the same as that of the perfective stem.","[221, 222]"
"
4.3.1. Causative verbs
       Jemez has a small number of lexicalized causative verbs. The language has no
productive syntactic process of causativization. The causative verbs end in [p=] and
were historically derived by compounding [pk*]'make' to other morphemes, such as
active verb roots (21), descriptive nouns (22), and nouns (23). (All the examples
below are perfective forms.)
                           'fill' (gY<'be full')
                           'sharpen' (kai 'be sharp')
                           'make someone cry' ($11- 'cry')
                           'make someone laugh' (hf-l- 'laugh')
                           'anger someone' (khyQ--'angry')
                           'dry something' (t7kle 'dry one')
                           'make something wet' (p7Fyk. 'wet one')
                           'gather, rake' (bi 'whole thing')
                           'melt' (p3$ 'water')
                           'write' (tiY 'mark')        The causative verbs are all transitive. Contrast the transitive verbs (24a) - (27a)
with the non-causative (i.e. intransitive) counterparts in (24b)- (27b). The causative
verbs are simple transitives with two arguments, which are encoded as A and P in the
transitive prefixes. The patient (P) in the transitive sentences corresponds to the S of
the intransitive verbs.(24)    a.      til-sa: tegYipa=           'I filled the cup.'

which we saw in Section 4.2.1, contain the causative [pre]. Nor does the verb [p$-]
'make' occur as a main verb in causative sentences. Jemez speakers tend to use verbs
such as rfl 'tell' or [ziepyb] 'tell someone to do' as the main verbs in expressing such
causative constructions as 'X made Y do it'.(28)   a.       it6-sChf-.ta?f         'I told him to sit.'

4.3.2. Motion verbs
       Some bound verb roots denoting manners of movement (29a) or other types of
action (29b) can be compounded to /m&/ 'go' and P&/ 'come' to derive intransitive
motion verbs.","[171, 172, 173]"
"
5Sprott's main consultants were two women in their 40s and a man in his late 30s
(Sprott 1992:6).Some of the differences between my description of Jemez and his
could be due to the generational differences among the speakers.
                             CHAPTER 2. PHONOLOGY
2.0. Introduction
        This chapter discusses the sound system of Jemez, including consonants and
vowels, phonotactics, suprascgmentals, and phonological rules. The language has a
complex phonology, and one of its most prominent features is the alternation of various
consonants. Some of the consonants have a limited distribution and are derived from
underlying segments. This is the rationale for setting up surface and underlying
consonants.
        Martin (1964) contains a detailed description of Jemez sounds. She uses a non-
abstract, classical phonemic approach in her analysis. She does not explain the
underlying systematic alternations among segments, some of which are phonologically
conditioned, others of which are morphologically conditioned. Her discussion of
syllables and tones is also brief, and there is a need for a more detailed account of them.
        A more abstract, generativist approach is used in this analysis and description of
Jemez phonology in order to explain the underlying regularities. This dissertation
employs some notions and formal notations of generative phonology, particularly a
version of Lexical Phonology. However, I have tried to include a detailed account of
the facts since the data presented here should be accessible to linguists of various
theoretical orientations. I have also tried to keep the usage of formalism to a minimum
for the same reason.
        Two terms and notations require clarification. I use the term 'underlying'
representation in the same sense as generative phonologists do, and I indicate the
underlying form by enclosing it between slashes / 1. This level is necessary for
capturing morphophonological alternations, which are very common in Jemez.
However, my 'surface' representation (or 'surface' forms), enclosed in square brackets
[ 1, is not the same as 'surface' (or 'systematic phonetic') representation, as was usedin early generative phonology.' It is an abstraction from the systematic phonetic
representation; that is, not all the phonetic details are represented. Some sounds have
'allophonic' variants: for example, [th]is sometimes pronounced as [ts]in Jemez.
(Note that I use square brackets for both the basic and the variant phones? The
phonetic symbol for the more common variant is used to refer to the particular 'surface'
segment, i.e. [th]in this case.) I have included a discussion of some speech variation,
but a detailed analysis of stylistic and other types of variation is beyond the scope of
this study.
       This surface level of representation is useful for practical reasons, too, that is,
for developing an orthography for the language. It is against the speakers' intuition to
insist that the letter 'byshould be used instead of 'm' in writing a word because the
former is the underlying form of (some occurrences of) the latter.
       The surface segments were identified primarily on the basis of whether they
contrast on the lexical level, usually by identifying minimal or near-minimal pairs.","[24, 25, 26]"
"
1.4. Fieldwork
       Data for this dissertation was collected at various times, mainly in the summer,
from 1987 through 1992 and in 1997.
       My main consultants were two men and two women. Two of them were in
their early 70s and the other two were in their late 60s. In addition, I worked with three
other Jemez people-two       women in their early 50s and a man around 30 years of age.
These seven people were all fluent in English, and the two elder men also knew
Spanish reasonably well.
       The main differences in speech between the four elders and the younger people
are phonological. For example, the younger speakers tend to replace Is1 in some
morphemes (e.g. the pronominal prefix ISQ-/)with /h/.4 As for tones, I did not notice
any significant difference between the older and younger generations.
       Furthermore, the four elder speakers have a larger Jemez vocabulary than the
younger people, particularly the youngest male. This point was confirmed by my
casual contact with other young Jemez speakers-those      in their 20s and 30s. For
instance, none of them could count beyond ten in Jernez.",[23]
"
4.8.2.3. Imperfective
       The imperfective form is much more regular than the other inflected forms in the
active paradigm. The form is almost possible to predict if we know two things: (a)
which underlying final consonant the verb root contains, and (b) whether the root
occurs with a suffix in the perfective. The imperfective form can be grouped into five
types. Of these, the types (199a) and (199b)are the most common.(l 99) a.        Verb root suffixed with I-a3g30
        b.       Reduplication of the verb root
       c.        Alternating final consonant of the verb root, plus a suffix
       d.        Verb root suffixed with 1 4
       e.        Irregularforms       The imperfective suffix /-a?l/only occurs, in principle, if the underlying root-
final consonant is /W/,/y/, N, h/,or Id/. (There are a few exceptions to this rule,
which will be discussed later in connection with reduplication.) The tonal pattern in
this type of the imperfective form is normally /FU.",[221]
"(72)    ~-E~$n&~o*-?e             'his dogs (pl)'""
        Q-l-khy~+y~--?~ (iben [3sg]-inv-dog-be.lying .down.pl/stat-nom)In addition, there are cases where the choice of the velar stop varies from one speaker
to another.(73)                 -
        ~-hG--k~a-?e~-hQ=-k?a-?e                     'his leg'

        bk%36*-kaa-?e kk%36--k3a-3e                  'my son'        There are more variations among the speakers regarding the initial velar stop of
the incorporated nouns than that of the verb stem. For instance, some people use the
form [khy@ni],
            while others say [kh&ni]for 'dog'(/khyi@na.45It is noteworthy that one
of the speakers who use @hkni]in this environment, an older man, consistently uses
[kh]in other words, too.(75)    i-kh6*lm .       'I am tired.' (intr[ l sg]-be. tired/stat)44/gy6./occurs when the possessed object is plural.
45Note that In/ in /khy&ng'dog' is not glottalized when the word is incorporated in the
verb. The underlyingly F tone in the second syllable of the word is lowered to L
through the F to M and M to L rules (Section 2.4.3), and the Glottalization rule does
not apply to the 1111. Thus the surface form of the word for 'dog', when incorporated,

This is in agreement with the above-mentioned distribution of velar stops, i.e. the
occurrence of palatalized and non-palatalized velar stops is phonetically conditioned:
the non-palatalized stops occur after non-low back vowels, and the palatalized stops

2.5.9. Syllable-final Consonant Drop
       As was discussed in Section 2.3.2, some syllables may have an underlying
syllable-final consonant, but in surface representation, no syllable can end in a
consonant except in pre-pause position, where syllable-final [S], and rarely g], can
occur. This entails that there is no consonant cluster word-medially. The underlying
syllable-final consonant is deleted in this environment.","[85, 86]"

1.3. Previous research on the language and people of Jemez
1.3.1. Linguistic studies
       There are not many published works on the Jemez language, and most of these
deal with comparison of Kiowa-Tanoan languages. Harrington (19 lob) was the first
linguist to include Jernez data. He compared the newly obtained Kiowa vocabulary
with similar words from Tiwa, Tewa, and Jemez. He did not provide any phonetic
guide to the triu~scription,and although some Jemez words cited there have accent
marks, the meanings of the marks are not clear.",[19]
"Sprott (1992), supporting Hale's hypothesis, refines the hierarchy by including the
'topic7as an additional conditioning factor. He proposes that the topic status can be
assigned to any non-SAP ('Speech Act Participant', i.e. any third-person nominal).
While the Jemez equivalent of the sentence ""The boy hit the dog"" will normally be in
the active form with the 'boy' as the subject, the sentence could be passivized if ""the
dog is clearly the protagonist"" and receives topic status (Sprott 1992: 178).
        Two morphological features are involved in passivization. First, in passive
sentences, the transitive verb is inflected according to the detransitive (i.e. passive)
paradigm. (See Section 4.8.3.) The active sentence in (161a) above contains the active
perfective form [m1of the verb 'see', while the passive sentence (160) has its passive
perfective form [mf ?W&].
        Second, the transitive verb takes transitive prefixes in active sentences, and
intransitive prefixes in passive sentences. (See examples (160) and (l 6 1A).) The
transitive prefixes encode A and P, whereas the intransitive prefixes show agreement
with S only, which corresponds to P of the active clause. Thus passivization, as
reflected in the pronominal prefixes, has the effect of reducing the number of arguments
by one.
         Similarly, the transitive benefactive prefixes (3 arguments) occur in active
transitive sentences, while the intransitive benefactive prefixes (2 arguments) are used
in passive sentences along with the passive form of verbs. The passivization of verbs
with benefactive prefixes depends on the person of A and B. (For the detailed
discussion of the benefactive, see Section 4.6.) Passivization must take place if A is
third person, and B is either first person or second person. However, passivization is
not allowed when A is first person or second person. P does not play any roIe here
although it shows agreement in the second part of the verbal prefix. Example (164) is
in the passive voice since A is third person and B is first person.(163) nc n@*bCIb t ~ h b                 'I baked bread for her.'

shown in (165) through (169). These examples illustrate clauses with a B argument,
either as possessor of P of a transitive verb or as the beneficiary of a transitive event.
Whenever A is third-person and B is first-person or second-person, an intransitive
benefactive prefix is attached to the passive form of the verb, as in the (b) sentences
below.

4.8.1. Introduction
4.8. l. l. Inflectional categories
        All active verbs have at least one set of perfective, imperfective and potential
forms. Transitive verbs have two sets, one for the active voice and one for the passive
voice. In addition to perfective, imperfective, and potential, there are imperative and
incorporative forms. Thus intransitive active verbs have five inflected forms, while
transitive active verbs have eight. This is illustrated in examples (170) and (171).","[207, 208, 209, 210]"

3.4.4.3. Class IIT nouns
        The basic number for nouns in this class is singular and plural, so the inverse is
only dual. There is some overlap in categories of nouns, as reckoned in English terms,
between Classes II and III, but Class HI includes many terms for clothing, ornaments,
and modem objects. (Note that Jemez people use English words for items such as
television and radio.) It is also interesting that the word for 'sun' is a Class III noun,
but the word for 'moon' is Class I.(38)    a. Clothing, ornaments:

only with the basic-number verbal prefixes, but [hi] 'flour' occurs with both the basic-
number and the non-inverse plural prefixes on verbs. Thus there are two subsets of
nouns in the class.
          Sprott (1 992) recognizes mass nouns as Class N, but he favors ""redefining it
on the basis of verbal morphology rather than nominal."" In other words, whether a
noun takes the inverse suffix 1-51should not be the deciding factor (1992:96). His
argument is summarized in (41).(41)      a. Some of what he groups as Class IV nouns appear to show singularlplural
          distinction in the verbal prefixes-just    like nouns of other classes-but     not in
          the nouns themselves (i.e. no inverse suffix): [sf    m]    'sand', [w&*sa]'ice',
          [@6*lb] 'hair', [w6h071k] 'dough' (1992:93-94).10 They can take both the basic-
          number and the non-inverse plural prefixes.
          b. Other nouns do not show such a number distinction in verbal agreement.
          They take only one type of prefix: [sf *] 'rain', pij*3w'eH]'salt' (inverse
          prefixes); [tYf-]'grass' (non-inverse, plural prefixes); [p7%]'water', rfJ'blood','orhe phonetic transcription of all the Iemez words cited from his dissertation is mine.
        [ga*] 'coffee', [tYkhaela]'clay' (basic-number prefixes). In addition, they do
       not occur with the inverse suffix l-Y, with the exception of [kaQJwk3] 'salt'
       ( 1992:95-96).       c. ""Class N now becomes those nouns that show no distinction between
       singular and plural in the verbal agreement system; they take one prefix and one
       prefix only"", i.e. those mentioned in (b) above (1992:96).","[127, 128, 129, 130]"

Shortening (2.5.8)rules. The Non-initial Root H Lowering rule depends on
