  According to Hudson (1976: 267), Sidaama uses a question suffix -ni, as in (ia) and (iia). However, my
consultant finds the use of this form ungrammatical, and uses intonation for questions, without any suffix,
as in (ib) and (iib).(i)     a.       *it-oo-tt-o-ni ?                             b.       it-oo-tt-o ?

A Sidaama sentence normally ends in a suffixed verb or the predicating noun-phraseclitic (=ho/=te or =ti). Non-WH-questions are usually only indicated by an intonationpattern in the final or semi-final word of a sentence different from that in its declarativecounterpart (Greenberg 1963: universal 8).,[92]

  Omotic languages are usually treated as constituting an independent branch of the Afro-Asiatic phylum
(Fleming 1969, 1976, Fleming and Bender 1976), but there are researchers who question their status. For
example, Lamberti (1991) claims that Omotic languages belong to the Cushitic family, based on their
morphological similarities.",[25]

        2)       ‘He did not close the door, and sat.’        Thus, the question of in what cases the verbs in the temporal sequenceconstruction constitute a single clause cannot be answered here, though whether or notSidaama shows the V-language pattern depends partly on what types of constructions ituses for events. The descriptions in 6.2.3-6.2.7 mainly focused on where more schematicand less schematic event components are morphosyntactically expressed. Nevertheless,the following two types of uses of the temporal sequence construction are excluded fromthe discussion, because the event components do not seem to be packaged denselyenough to be treated as macro-events. One type is a case where the two verbs can bemodified by different temporal adverbials, as in (6.47) and (6.48).12

necessarily correspond to Talmy’s characterization of a macro-event.","[738, 739]"

"         Admittedly, the use of a single consultant for a grammatical description cannottake into account idiolectal or dialectal differences. Nevertheless, even when multipleconsultants on a language are employed, it would be difficult to ask all of them exactlythe same set of questions to write a grammar of the language; a bias toward the judgmentof even a small number of linguistic forms by a certain speaker or speakers out of a groupof consultants would be inevitable. The consultation with a single speaker makes it easyto obtain consistent data. In order to benefit from this strength, I checked almost all theexamples in this dissertation with Abebayehu at least twice.",[47]
"         The question here is how a language expresses the fulfillment of the goal that theagent intends to attain, or the confirmation of the fulfillment of the agent’s goal that isonly implicated, as in (6.137) and (6.138). In S-languages, it is characteristically done bythe use of a satellite, whereas in V-languages, the main verb of a multi-verb constructionis used. Sidaama basically follows the latter pattern.

                  i.       RC=hu di=...=ti          Predicates in Sidaama can be either verb predicates, as in (3.436a) and (3.436b),or NP predicates (with noun-phrase clitics), as in (3.436c)-(3.436i). The clitic di=attaches to clause-final constituents, as in (3.436a), (3.436c), and (3.436e)-(3.436i), or topreverbal constituents, as in (3.436b) and (3.436d). Each type is discussed with examplesbelow. In this language, focus is placed on a preverbal constituent. As indicated in theglosses for some of the examples of (3.436b) and (3.436d), when di= attaches to apreverbal constituent, the constituent is contrasted to other constituents that (potentially)stand in a paradigmatic relation with it.• di=verb: (3.436a)          When used as a predicate, any verb in the present perfect, imperfect, progressive,or continuous aspect, can be negated by di=, which immediately precedes it, as in(3.437)-(3.442).7878
   When this clitic is attached to a verb, the verb has to be in the present perfect, imperfect, progressive, or
continuous aspect, and cannot be in the simple perfect. When the progressive form of a verb, “V-PERS-
INF-INST exist” (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.1), is negated with the clitic di=, it occurs immediately before
the content verb, as in (ia), rather than immediately before the existential verb, as in (ib).","[304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"

The construction where the subject NP in the IPC is predicated by theexistential/locational verb is informative when it contains a locative NP that expresses thelocation of the referent of X’s Y, as in (5.267). In this case, although the IPC portion (lit.,‘X’s Y’) presupposes the possessive relation, the construction as a whole concernslocation. As in (5.268), the dative-possessor construction with a locative expression,where no single constituent presupposes the possessive relation between X and Y,expresses the availability of X’s Y to X as well as the location of X’s Y.(5.267)         damboow-i                     bun-i                           t’arap’ees-u

Two of these, -imma and -ina(a)te, are not limited toadjectives; both can attach also to other nouns (section 4.2.1.1.2) and -imma can attach toverbs (see below) as well.(4.4)          adjective                             noun-imma          lowo ‘much’                           low-imma ‘size, greatness’

                  to mean, ‘She is that tall man’s sister.’          It should be noted that the use of adjectives like nouns is different from the use ofadjectives as nouns. In Sidaama, the noun modified by an adjective can sometimes beomitted.33 In this case, the adjective modifying the omitted noun looks as if it wereserving as an argument. This happens when the referent of the omitted noun isunderstood by the conversation participants to be a particular entity. It also happenswhen the referent is compared to another entity that belongs to the category of theomitted noun that has a property different from the one expressed by the adjective. For
33
   Dryer (2004) points out that there are two types of cases where noun phrases without nouns (or
pronouns) (i.e., those consisting of elements that would otherwise be optional modifiers of “head” nouns)
are likely to be used: (i) “when the speaker does not know what kind of thing the thing that they are
referring to is” and (ii) “when the kind will be so obvious to the hearer that it can be left out” (p.70). Dryer
argues that in the case of (i), nouns do not have a privileged status in noun phrases, and proposes that all
noun phrases are headless; he questions the ‘head’ of an NP as a universal notion. On the other hand,
according to him, in the case of (ii), ellipsis of the noun is likely to be involved.
          The use of noun phrases in Sidaama that do not contain nouns, as in (3.145) and (3.146), is an
example of the latter case. Such noun phrases in Sidaama can occur only when the hearer knows what the
ellipsed noun is.","[175, 176]"

          These suffixes cannot follow the predicating noun-phrase clitics. In place ofthem, the verb ikk- ‘to become’ is used, as in (4.258) and (4.259).","[458, 459, 460, 461]"
"3.2.2.1 Noun-Phrase Clitic: =ta/=ha/=re          Sidaama has two types of clitics that form NPs with constituents that modify them(in other words, that might be analyzed as the heads of NPs). One type is discussed inthis section, and the other type is discussed in the next section.57          The type of noun-phrase clitic (NPC) dealt with here has the following accusativeforms: =ta (F)/=ha (M)/=re (PL) (its other case forms are discussed shortly). It has threeuses (i)-(iii) in Table 3.17, each of which are illustrated with the examples in (3.336)-
57
   An alternative analysis of the first type of NPC may be that it is a nominalizer that turns an open
sentence into an NP and a sentence into a CP. However, when it attaches to an adjective or a non-genitive
NP, it cannot form an argument NP, though it can form a predicate.",[260]

Finally, for an experiential meaning, which concerns the occurrence or non-occurrence ofan event before a certain point in time (e.g., English: I have been to that village before.),only the present perfect can be used, and the simple perfect cannot.(4.177)          t’aa    eessa       bura           maala          lame-woyete=lla

          On the other hand, there are also a few cases where only the simple perfect can beused. First, in a subordinate clause ending in edensa-a-nni [last-LV-LOC] (Chapter 3section 3.1.1.3), the verb preceding it has to be in the simple perfect, but not in thepresent perfect.(4.178)          lase      ulla-te-nni                kinco

                        Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 407Also, when the subordinator suffix -ro occurs at the end of a conditional clause thatexpresses a realizable condition, the verb preceding the clitic is in the simple perfect, notthe present perfect (section 4.2.2.3.1).(4.179)          ado-te    saa                hi--i-tt-o-ro           ado

          There is also one adverbial construction where the simple perfect is always used:V-S.PRF-kki-nni ‘without doing ...’ (section 4.2.2.3.7).(4.180)                                 it-ø-i-kki-nni

          The existential/locational verb (henceforth, “the existential verb”) (lit., ‘to cometo exist, come to be located’), which is used to indicate the existence of an entity or thelocation of one entity with respect to another, is always in a present perfect form, asshown in (4.181), and is incompatible with most of the inflectional suffixes with whichother verbs can usually occur. It expresses the present state of existence or locatedness as                                             - 407 -

the resultative state of a state-change, as indicated above in the gloss for this verb(nevertheless, the present study employs ‘exist’ as its gloss). Thus, this verb does nottake any other aspect suffix. For example, it has no simple perfect or imperfect forms(e.g., *n o - u-mm-a/*no-u-mm-o [exist-S.PRF.1-1SG-F/exist-S.PRF.1-1SG-M] or*no-ee-mm-a/*no-ee-mm-o [exist-IMPRF.1-1SG-F/exist-IMPRF.1-1SG-M]) (for theimperfect meaning, verbs like hee- ‘to live’ and kees- ‘to stay’ are used instead).","[421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429]"
"         Sidaama verbs are either intransitive or transitive.                    There are almost noambitransitive verbs like the English verb break that can be both.19 As shown in (3.68),Sidaama has a limited number of intransitive-transitive pairs of morphologicallyunrelated lexical verbs that seem to show a semantic contrast, but it is not clear whetherthey are contrastive only with respect to causativity.

First, there are a large number of intransitive verb roots whose causative formsare transitive verbs (Chapter 4 section 4.2.1.3.2). Second, the passive form of a transitiveverb root acts as an intransitive verb that expresses a state-change (Chapter 4 section4.2.1.3.3). Third, there are many pairs of idiomatic expressions with ass- ‘to do’ and y-‘to say’ that show a transitivity contrast (see section 3.1.5 for more details).",[137]

3.1.4 Adverbs           The class of lexical adverbs in Sidaama is small in size compared to other openclasses. Like adjectives, lexical adverbs that are not derived from other parts of speechare small in number. Examples are shown in (3.163). Many of them are time adverbs,which refer to temporal relations or points in time relative to the time of utterance or aparticular reference point.

   Note that the glottal stop, which is included in non-agentive/self-agentive verbs, e’- and sa’-, does not
occur in their agentive counterparts.
          Note also that there are a few other pairs of verbs contrasting in agentivity.(i)          non-agentive/self-agentive                                          agentive

verb but a self-contained motion verb. On the other hand, unlike the agentive forms of (ib) and (ic), their
non-agentive/self-agentive forms are self-contained motion verbs rather than translational motion verbs.
21
  A fuller characterization of motion verbs in a particular language needs to test them for their patterns of
occurrence with temporal expressions, for example, by means of Talmy’s Motion-aspect Formulas (Talmy
2000a: 215-216, 2000bL 53-56), but this is beyond the scope of the present study.","[754, 755]"

There are also those adjectives that have no plural forms (e.g., hala’lado ‘wide’, wudde‘expensive (AMH)’). In (3.126), the subject head noun is plural, but the adjective thatmodifies it and the predicative adjectives are both in the non-plural forms.

As a rule, the choice of the form dependson the gender of the subject noun in the case of a predicative adjective and on the genderof the modified noun in the case of an attributive adjective. Some adjectives that havethe gender distinction are listed in (3.127). The two pairs of contrastive suffix forms,-(aal)eette (F)/-(aal)eessa (M) and -(aall)itte (F)/-(aall)icca (M), also occur in somepairs of feminine and masculine nouns (e.g., lakk-itte (F)/lakk-icca (M) ‘twin’; seeChapter 4 section 4.2.1.1; as seen shortly, many words with these suffixes cannot beclassified into adjectives or nouns), but the contrast in terms of -(aam)e (F)/-(aam)o (M)is restricted to adjectives.","[165, 166, 167]"

         All Sidaama words end in vowels. Generally, open-class words end in /e/, /a/, or/o/ in their citation forms, and can end in /u/ or /i/ only when followed by a suffix thatconsists only of or ends in one of these vowels.32.2 Consonant Clusters and Geminates2.2.1 Consonant Clusters         The maximum number of consonants that can occur successively in Sidaama istwo. Consonant clusters only occur intervocalically across syllables. The large majorityof clusters of different consonants are of one of the following two types: (a)sonorant–obstruent or (b) glottal stop–sonorant (Hudson 1976: 249, Wedekind 1980:141-142, Teferra 1994: 1091-1095, Teferra 2000: 15). Some examples are shown in(2.3).(a) Sonorant–Obstruent         The nasals and the liquids can each be followed immediately by obstruents.

"       The framing event, which is the main event of a macro-event, constitutes theschematic core of the macro-event, and has a framing function relative to the macro-event. It “provides for the whole macro-event the overarching conceptual framework orreference frame within which the other included activities are conceived of as takingplace”, and represents “the upshot – relative to the whole macro-event” in the sense that“it is the framing event that is asserted in a positive declarative sentence, that is deniedunder negation, that is demanded in an imperative, and that is asked about in aninterrogative”; moreover, it determines the overall temporal and spatial frameworks, theargument structure, and the syntactic complement structure (Talmy 2000b: 219).",[711]
"       Like other event types, temporal contouring is expressed differently in V-languages and S-languages. For the framing event of temporal contouring, V-languagescharacteristically use the main verb of a construction and S-languages a satellite (or anadpositional phrase), though S-languages may also have lexical verbs for temporalcontouring (e.g., English: begin, end, continue, repeat, finish) (Talmy 2000b: 232).",[802]
"             •   There is a negative suffix except in Sidaama, which uses a negative

Chapters 2-5 usebasic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe the phonology andmorphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event integration patterns (Talmy1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this language.","[19, 20, 21, 22]"

       The negation test reveals the ambiguity of a sentence like (6.29) (repeated belowas (6.36)), which could be taken as an instance of the manner/concomitance constructionor the temporal inclusion construction. The main verb of (6.29) (e’- ‘to enter’) is negatedin (6.37). When (6.37) is interpreted as an instance of the manner/concomitanceconstruction, as in (6.37-1), the occurrences of the event components expressed by thetwo verbs are both negated. On the other hand, when (6.37) is interpreted as an instanceof the temporal inclusion construction, as in (6.37-2), only the occurrence of the eventcomponent expressed by V2 is negated.(6.36) kaase       min-i          iddo-ra

Inmost cases, the negation of V2 has scope over both of the event components, as in (6.38-1)-(6.44-1). Nevertheless, a difference usually emerges in an alternative interpretationdepending on whether or not the V1 of this construction is a Manner verb. When V1expresses a Manner of the translational motion of the V2 in this construction, thenegation of V2 can often also be interpreted as resulting in the negation of only theManner, as shown in (6.38-2) and (6.39-2).10 On the other hand, when the V1 of the

However, it is not clear how the difference of the alternative interpretations due to thescope of negation is related to the single-clause-hood of the construction. Furthermore,there are cases where the above generalization does not work. For example, there arecases like (6.45) where the negation of V2 in a temporal sequence construction using amanner verb as V1 can have a scope over both verbs, or otherwise over V2, rather thanover V1.

       2)       ‘The ball rolled, but did not enter.’There are also cases like (6.46) where the negation of V2 in a temporal sequenceconstruction using a non-manner verb as V1 can have scope over both verbs, or otherwiseover V1, rather than over V2.","[733, 734, 735, 736, 737, 738]"
"4.2.2.3.7 Negative Suffixes          Unlike the negative proclitic di= (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.4), which occurs at thebeginning of a constituent in the focus position and is used to negate various types ofconstituents, the negative suffix -kki is always attached to the verb of a subordinateclause.

          There are two idiomatic expressions in which a verb with -kki may be followed bya nominal suffix (V-PERSON-INF-kki-ra and V-S.PRF-kki-nni). First, when -kkinegates a verb with a combination of the person suffix and the infinitive suffix that isfollowed by the dative suffix -ra (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.4), the suffix occursimmediately before -ra, as in (4.247).

                 ‘She swore not to come.’
          Second, the suffix -kki can occur right before the ablative-instrumental suffix-nni. The verb is always in the simple perfect before -kki-nni, and the negative suffix-kki seems to nominalize the verb. An adverbial of this structure may be used with a verbof prevention as in (4.248), or may express manner as in (4.249).(4.248)          ub-b-u-kki-nni

          There is another negative suffix, -nke, which only attaches to a verb in the first-person plural imperative or the optative (section 4.2.2.3.5).(4.250)          i-n-t-o-nke

"4.2.2.1.2 Gender Suffixes on Nouns       A relatively small number of common nouns have pairs of forms that contrast ingender with feminine and masculine suffixes. There are two pairs of such suffixes:                                          - 350 -

The former pair is often used also to derive nouns or adjectives from verbs(sections 4.2.1.1.1 and 4.2.1.2), and the latter is used to derive nouns from various partsof speech. The latter are a pair of allomorphs of the singular suffix – some pairs haveboth number-neutral forms and plural forms (e.g., UM: k’osorro, PL: k’osorr-oota‘[name of a bird]’).

         Singular and plural forms of common nouns are clearly marked with the singularand plural suffixes. A problem arises with the treatment of unmarked forms, specificallywhether or not the ending vowel of an unmarked form should be regarded as a suffix. Allunmarked forms normally end in -a, -e, or -o, and could be treated as a suffix, like threeof the allomorphs of the nominalizing suffix that attaches to a verb root (section4.2.1.1.1). However, the citation form of any noun ends in one of these vowels inSidaama. Because there is no clear evidence for or against the treatment of the ending ofan unmarked form as a suffix, the present study arbitrarily excludes it from the discussion

   There are three cases where =te/=ho agrees in gender with the predicate noun, but not with the subject
noun. First, as already discussed in footnote 23, when the subject is the infinitive form of a verb, the choice
of the noun-phrase clitic that follows a predicate noun is determined by the gender of the predicate noun, as
in (ia) (though a verb in the infinitive is usually treated as feminine when the predicate is a verb, as in (ib).(i)      (a)      saale            k’is-a                     ise-ra

depends on the gender of the predicate noun, regardless of the gender of the subject noun, as in the
following examples (ficcee is a feminine noun, whereas aiyyaana is a masculine noun; when barr-i is not
mentioned, the subject is impersonal third person).",[269]

Most affixes are suffixes, thoughthere are case suprafixes (specifically, the accusative, oblique, and genitive casesuprafixes). There are no prefixes in this language (though the negative proclitic di=(Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.4) is often treated as a verb prefix rather than a clitic in theliterature; e.g., Teferra 2000). Reduplication is not uncommon in Sidaama, though notproductive.","[331, 332]"
