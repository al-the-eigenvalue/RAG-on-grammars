  6.3.3.9     Talking about time
The clause nala h-uor ‘strike something’ is used to refer to time measured in hours; it
corresponds to English ‘o’clock’. In declarative constructions this clause is followed by
a numeral indicating how many times the ‘beating’ occurred. In questions, the complex
verb yen-r- ‘be how many’ is in situ position of the questioned numeral.","[298, 299]"

3.5.7    Question words
The last closed grammatical category contains question words. In Abui, question words
are forms such as nala ‘what’, maa ‘who’, te ‘where, how’, teina ‘when’ and yeng ‘how
much’. These forms always remain ‘in situ’; i.e. in the syntactic position of the
questioned constituent. The question word nala ‘what’ is used as default question word
referring to non-human entities. In (176), nala ‘what’ occurs in two different syntactic
positions. In (a), it occurs clause finally, questioning the identity of the referred object.
In (b), it occurs in the position of the U argument, questioning the complement of ong
‘make’.(176) a. {it        do}clause nala?              b. a         nala    ong?
         lie.CPL PRX             what                 2SG what         make
         ‘what is this (lying here)?’                 ‘what are you doing/making?’The question word nala may be used to question the species or kind of an entity. This
is illustrated in (177). In (a), the kind of a tree is questioned. In (b), the name of a place
is asked in a construction that involves a relative clause:(177) a. it     do      nala bataa?
         lie.on PRX what tree
         ‘what (kind of ) tree is this?’                                       [Note.007.01]

           ‘what is the name of this place/land?’                              [Note.010.01]The form nala ‘what’ can be used in both interrogative and indicative constructions.
Although both constructions have identical word orders, they are differentiated by their
intonational contour. In (176)-(177) nala ‘what’ is used in interrogative constructions.
In (178), the form nala is used to refer to non-specific entities and is translated as
‘something’. In both cases, the form nala expresses a non-specific U argument of the
verbs nee ‘eat’ and lakda ‘read’:

used to refer to animates. This is illustrated in (179). In (a), the speaker assumes a non-
human actor that caused a bite. In (b), the speaker assumes that the bite is caused by a
human.(179) a. nala e-l          takei?                     b. maa e-l                    takei?

However, the question nala ‘what’ can be used as well. This is illustrated in (180):(180) a. a-ne               nala?                b. a-ne                  maa?

         ‘what is your name?’                         lit.: ‘who is your name?’A question word that refers to space and manner is te ‘where’. As illustrated in (181),
the question word te ‘where’ is found in the position of the questioned constituent (in
situ). In both cases, the question word te ‘where’ combines with the location verb mi
‘be in’:(181) a. fe te          mi-a                   b. a        te        he-mi-a                 taa

         ‘where is the pig?’                        ‘where do you stay, where do you sleep?’The question word te ‘where, how’ combines with the generic root ng ‘see’ when the
direction of a motion is questioned. An example is given in (182), where the form
te=ng combines with the verb yaar ‘go’.(182) ma          e-d-o,             a te=ng      yaar-i?

specific, random location or direction of the event. This is illustrated in (183), where
the speaker expresses that somebody left for no matter where.

‘get like that’ to inquire about the kind of the referent, or the manner of the event. For
more details about the index verbs, see section 3.4.5.6. In (184), the question word te
‘where’ combines with the complex verb wi-d- to inquire about the kind of dog that ate
a rodent.(184) kaai te       wi-d-a                                hu      he-l             rui     nee

drum. This construction is used when the price of a traditional drum ‘moko’ is
bargained in bride-price negotiations.(185) he-tafaa       e       te          wi-l                da-moi-d-i?

event is questioned with a complex construction that involves the question word te
‘where’ combined with a complex verb that is derived from the index verb stem wi ‘be
like.MD’. In (186), the reason of addressee’s crying is questioned.(186) te      wi-r=te,                             a       enra?

question word teina ‘when’ occurs in the left edge of a clause, a typical location for
temporal adverbs, or phrases that indicate the temporal location of an event. In (188),
21 The question word teina ‘when’ is possibly derived. It could be historically derived from the combination oftwo verb stems te-i ‘put where’ and the index verb stem na ‘be like this’ that compose the notion of ‘when’ a
question about the temporal location of an event that is identical to the event described in the second clause.

2.2.1      Distribution of consonants
The following overview of the phonotactic distribution of Abui consonants takes into
account their occurrence in (i) syllables: either in syllable onset or coda; and in (ii)

yambuk ‘glass’ is a derived word consisting of three morphemes. The word-final use of
/m/ is attested only in the verbal domain. The generic verb m ‘be in, take’ may occur
word finally.

In (23), the nasal /n/ occurs in a single case as word medial coda. The noun tukonrek
‘stick’ is possibly derived from the verb tukon ‘cut’.

position it is not represented in orthography (see also 2.6). The glottal stop appears in
pronunciation clearly when nouns such as aremang ‘tribe’, ata ‘leaves’ or eti ‘shrimp’
combine with possessive prefixes, which are open light syllables consisting of a
consonant and a vowel (for further details about possessive prefixes, see section 3.3.2).
Glottal stop occurs word internally in the word he’e ‘yes’ that is used as answer for a
yes-no question.","[54, 55, 56, 57]"
"16The anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC) is the grammaticalized index verb stem nu ‘be.like.PRF’. This stem is
possibly a homogeneous complex verb that is derived from the generic roots n ‘see’ and u ‘leave’ indicating
that the specific referent has been ‘seen’ previously.

earlier, the speaker assumes that the addressee is able to identify the canoe.(131) pelang o            tut      tah-a                it-i

      ‘that canoe (I talked about before) lies on the shore’                            [B09.076.01]The anaphoric demonstrative lo (MD) has the same function as o (MD) discussed in
(131). It refers to a previously mentioned referent that is known to both speech
participants. As illustrated in (132) an NP is linked with the linker ba (LNK) to the
adverb el ‘before’ that is followed by the anaphoric demonstrative lo (MD). The
construction is an answer to the question ‘what are you roasting there?’ The speaker
says that the fish was actually a bit ‘smelly’ and explains ‘so that is why I am roasting it’.(132) [afu]NP ba       {el     lo} he-amaling fa                        kabei ho-pa

      ‘that fish from earlier on (I talked about before), it is actually a bit smelly’ [B05.042.02]More information about NPs combined with the linker ba (LNK) is provided in section
4.5. In (133), the use of the anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD) is illustrated. It
presents the information as medial (less proximate) from the point of view of the
addressee (a) and serves to draw his attention. In (b), the speaker uses yo (MD.AD) to
present new information in a way as if the addressee is actually aware of it.(133) a. karong      yo        tirei=si        taka         kang

116                                      CHAPTER III
In (134), yo (MD.AD) occurs as the final element of a relative clause linked to the NP
kaai ‘dog’ with the linker ba (LNK). The speaker refers to addressee’s knowledge of the
‘dog that died’ and informs what happened to it. To mark this contrast the NP is
combined with the anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD) that indicates that the referent
is medial (less proximate) in discourse with respect to the addressee.(134) [kaai]NP ba         {mon-i       yo}RC he-adua               mi ba           ul     ì

      ‘that dog (you talked about before) that died, his owner took it and buried’ [B05.047.04]There are two demonstratives hu (SPC) and nu (SPC.AD) that are restricted to the
anaphoric function. They do not have a deictic use and never precede the head noun, as
illustrated in (135).(135) a. fala       nu                                 b. *nu          fala

            ‘a house (you do not know about)’Both forms indicate that the referent is ‘referential’ in the sense that is it ‘accessible’
within the discourse. The anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) contrasts with the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD) that indicates a referent ‘specific’ only for the
speaker. That means that the referent is located only in speaker’s own ‘discourse’ and is
not shared with the addressee. In (136), a fragment of a narrative is presented. A man
ate some of the fragrant betel nut that belonged to his wife and gives this as an
explanation to a giant snake, from which he tries to steal some betel nuts.(136) ne-mayol          he-fu                 hu       na      takei

discourse and its anaphoricity is questionable. I consider it as anaphoric only within the
discourse of the speaker. It encodes the subtle referential distinction that the presented
referent is only new for the addressee but specific for the speaker. In (137), the use of
the anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) is illustrated. Consider the conversation fragment
where one participant inquires whether addressee’s wife cooks meat. The answer is that
‘some fish’ is being cooked. The NP afu hu ‘some fish’ refers to a ‘fish’ that is only in
discourse of the speaker in A, and thus specific; however, it is not shared with the
speaker in Q for who the information is new.

for both speaker and addressee. In that sense, it may be considered as definite. This is
illustrated in (138), where the head noun fu ‘betel nut’ is modified with the anaphoric
demonstrative nu (SPC). The demonstrative indicates that both speech participants can
identify the betel nut.(138) fu        nu       pi      takai

contrasted. In the NP given in (a), the anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD) combines
with the head bataa ‘wood’ that is preceded by the deictic demonstrative oro (DST). The
NP refers to a specific tree, visible for both speech participants. In (b), the anaphoric
demonstrative hu (SPC) combines with the question word nala ‘what’. In questions, the
anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) is found frequently. It indicates that the questioned
referent is new in the shared context.(139) a. oro bataa nu              ho-ng                mara!

the verb taa ‘lie’ marking the end of an embedded clause. The anaphoric demonstrative
has a nominalizing effect on the VP di taa ‘he lies’. It expresses that the temporal
location of the event of ‘lying’ as proximate to the event of ‘not lying on a mat’.(140) [di taa] do            adik tai             taa naha

      ‘he sleeps without a mat’, lit.: ‘when he lies, he doesn’t lie on a mat’   [B07.053.04]The use of the anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) in the verbal domain is illustrated in
(141). The anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) follows the verb rik ‘hurt’. It marks the
information ‘the pig is ill’ as new for the addressee.

first clause (all constituents preceding hu) as background of the event expressed by the
second clause di miei ‘he came’; however, this background is new for the addressee.(142) [moku loku te-l                      bol pe] hu di miei

      ‘the children almost started fighting when he came’                  [B07.078.01]In sum, anaphoric demonstratives are not restricted to the nominal domain. They may
combine with VPs to specify the temporal location of an event with respect to
discourse, introduce background information and other functions. Polysemy of
demonstrative elements is also attested in other Papuan languages (cf. Reesink, 1994).
More examples about the use of the anaphoric demonstratives in the clausal domain
can be found in section 6.4.3.","[137, 138, 139, 140, 141]"

9 In Stokhof (1984:125) the forms such as ning or fal are analyzed as a morpheme that is part of a complexpronoun. The form ning is analyzed as a classifier ‘indicating more than one human being’, however, this
form only combines with nouns. The Ateng Melang form fa corresponding to fal is identified in Stokhof
(1984:128) as ‘together’ but its categorial membership is not specified.

to the kind of the referent. The indexed events and referents are located on the familiar
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL axis. This axis is found also in Abui demonstratives and
deictic verbs. Note that the perfect stems nu and hu have been grammaticalized as
anaphoric demonstratives indicating ‘specificity’. For more details, see section 3.5.2.2.
        Abui index verbs are used in questions and in constructions that express the
kind of the referent. The kind of a referent and the manner of an event is described in a
complement clause that serves as an argument of the index verb.11 The proximal index
verbs na/ni/n-u ‘be like.PRX’ are used to refer to the manner and kind obvious and
familiar to both speech participants. The medial index verbs wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ are
frequently used in questions. The speaker presents the questioned manner or kind as
medial. The distal index verbs ha/hi/h-u ‘be like.DST’ are used to refer to manner or
kind that is not familiar to the speaker. The verb ha ‘be like.DST’ may be used to refer
to the manner in which the addressee intends to perform an event, from which the
speaker wants to dissociate himself.
        An example of the manner anaphoric use is given in (112). The verb stem wa
‘be like.MD’ combines with the argument, expressed with the pronominal prefix do-
(3I.REC). It refers to the rain that prevented the participant from going to the market.(112) anui sei                   hare do-wa                   anu=ng                       yaar       naha

ha ‘be like.DST’ occurs as a single predicate in a question. This question is used in
situation when the Abui equivalent of the Malay word anjing ‘dog’ is asked:(113) ‘anjing’ nu          nala ha?

(3II.LOC). It marks the first clause as a manner in which the event described in the11 Index verbs semantically group the manner of event (in fact kind of event) and the kind of referent inadnominal and question uses. In the literature similar predicates were referred to as kind-anaphoric predicates
(cf. Landman and Morzycki, 2003:11).

stem n-u ‘be like.PRX’ in the previous example. The stem combines with the
pronominal prefix he- (3II.LOC). Its complement clause is interpreted as a conditional

          4 Nouns and Noun Phrases
In this chapter, I discuss Abui nouns and noun phrases. Abui nouns are defined by
their referential properties as lexical items referring to time-stable concrete entities
(unique persons, places, or objects, discussed in 4.1). There are also lexical items that
refer to less concrete (typically) uncountable objects and substances. These lexical items
are ambiguous as they may as well refer to events, and they are analysed as categorially
indetermined (see section 3.2.2). Their grammatical category is determined by their
syntactic context. When an ambiguous item is inserted in the head position of an NP
structure; it is identified as a noun.
        In Abui, there is a systematic difference between animate and inanimate
referents. Animate referents are typically expressed by unambiguously nominal lexical
items. Nouns referring to animates are treated differently in grammatical operations
such as possessive inflection or person inflection on the verbs (see 3.2.4). Inanimate
nouns have a more generic reference and denote substances rather than individuated
objects; they are underspecified for number, shape or size. In discourse, inanimate
nouns often combine with other elements that specify their number, shape, or size.
        Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.","[154, 155, 156]"

       ‘Simon looked at the mobile phone and he did not understand it’           [B10.048.02]The examples (116)-(121) suggest that the location of the modifiers linked with ba
(LNK) with respect of the NP sometimes follows the NP template. Modifiers that
denote spatial position or possessor may precede the NP linked to them with ba (LNK).
Although semantically, the NP functions as the head of the structure, the headedness of
structures with ba (LNK) is problematic on the syntactic level, because the relative clause
or other linked modifier appears in two positions.
         Den Dikken (2006) presents an interesting cross-linguistic account of similar
structures that contain a linker and argues that it is actually the linker that is the ‘head’
of these structures. The other functions of ba seem to support this analysis (see 3.5.6).
The linker ba (LNK) probably originates in the verb ba ‘say’ that is grammaticalized to
an affirmative marker (6.4.2.1). The form ba is sometimes used as a copula, as
illustrated in (122). In (a), ba occurs as final constituent and serves as an optional
copula. Because the NP complement kaai ‘dog’ of the copula clause is itself a verb (the
stative verb kika ‘be red’) a copula is not necessary. However, the linking function of ba
is contrasted in (b), where it is grammaticalized to a relator glossed here as (LNK).(122) a. [kaai]copula topic [kika]copula complement       (ba)

       4.6       Nominal predicates
A nominal predicate is an NP that serves as the main predicate of a sentence. In Abui,
there is no copula that links the nominal predicate with its argument. An example of

This is illustrated in (126) where the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ links the nominal
predicate with the NP Simon ayoku ‘two Simons’. The construction is contrasted with
nominal predicative construction in (b).(126) a. Simon       ayoku he-n-u                          muknehi

question word nala ‘what’. Note that the question word nala ‘what’ is in-situ.(127) moku kiang nu             he-n-u                     nala? moku neng re mayol?

index verb wi-d- ‘be like.MD’ usually follows both NPs. This is illustrated in (128),
176                                      CHAPTER IV

        3.5     Closed grammatical categories
The remaining grammatical categories are closed and contain a limited number of
members. On the basis of their distributional and functional properties, I distinguish
the following closed grammatical categories: adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2),
quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4), adverbs (3.5.5), conjunction markers
(3.5.6), and question words (3.5.7).",[132]
"(168) Boi e          he-feela                  Simon       e       Dori

        axe      machete and whetstone         be.red
        ‘axes, swords and red whetstones’In coordinating constructions, at least two nouns are conjoined by a conjunction
marker or simply listed with an intonational pause after each of the constituents.
Coordinating constructions must be distinguished from list compounds (see section
126                                       CHAPTER III
4.3.3). The order of constituents in a list compound is lexicalized, while in case of
coordinating construction this is not the case.
        The conjunction markers ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), and re ‘or’ may be used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain. The linker ba (LNK) joins two constituents so that they
have shared reference to a single referent or event. I refer to this linker as ‘intersective’.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) may be used in nominal domain to link an NP to other
constituents (relative clauses, numerals, deictics, other NPs) that serve as adnominal
modifiers. In (169), the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the head noun kaai ‘dog’ with
the modifier NP he-bikeng faring ‘his many lice’. The complex NP serves as the A
argument of the verb kafia ‘scrape, scratch’ and it is co-indexed with the prefix do-
(3I.REC).(169) [kaai]NP ba       {he-bikeng faring}NP oro do-kafi-a
      dog        LNK 3II.AL-louse many                 DST 3I.REC-scrape-DUR
      ‘that dog with many lice is scratching (itself) over there’                    [B05.060.02]In section 4.5, I discuss other structures that are linked with the intersective linker ba
(LNK) to an NP. In the verbal domain, ba (LNK) links two verbs as in (170) the verbs
bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’. The events of ‘carrying’ and ‘going’ refer to a complex event
‘carry towards’.(170) tafaa di bang ba              yaa     melang       mi-a-d-i
      drum 3A carry LNK go                  village      be.in-be.at-hold-PFV
      ‘he carried drums to the village’                                           [B02.118.07:50]       The linked verbs form a tight unit that falls under the scope of a negation. This
type of construction is different from serial verb constructions, which are defined as a
verb clusters without any conjunction markers (see 8.1). The use of ba (LNK) in the
verbal domain will not be further analysed in the current description.
       The intersective linker ba (LNK) contrasts with the non-intersective linker ya
glossed as SEQ(uential). ya (SEQ) indicates a non-intersective union of two constituents
(a sequence of phrases or clauses). It may be used in both nominal and verbal domain.
In the nominal domain, ya (SEQ) links two NPs. This is illustrated in (171), where two
NPs are linked. Recall (169), to see the contrast with ba (LNK) that can not serve as a
coordinating conjunction marker.(171) a. Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata                  b. luka-luka     ya       yoikoi

In the verbal domain, ya (SEQ) links verbs that retain their own reference so that the
construction is read as a sequence of events. Example (170) is contrasted with example
(172) below. In (172), the verbs bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’ do not refer to a single event
because the ‘carrying’ preceded the ‘going’.(172) tafaa di bang ya            yaa melang mi-a-d-i
      drum 3A carry SEQ go               village        be.in-be.at-hold-PFV
      ‘he carried drums and (then) went to the village’In (173), a more complex example is given, where the non-intersective linker ya (SEQ)
marks that the verbs we ‘leave’, tahai ‘search’ and marang ‘go up’ describe successive
events.(173) a     we ya afu do             kabei tahai ya         marang                  na       nee re

      ‘go and search for some fish and come up, i will eat it up’                            [B06.078.00:37]The linker re ‘or’ indicates a disjoint set of constituents. It is often used in alternative
questions, in which two or more possible answers are presented. It is used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain as illustrated in (174).(174) a. maama       re ni-ya                              b. a          la         taa re a            me?

derived from index verbs or linkers discussed above. A number of such phrases are
given in (175).(175) a. he-ni-l                       ba               b.            he-ni-l                                 mi

             3 Grammatical Categories
In this chapter, I describe Abui grammatical categories. Grammatical categories are
sometimes referred to as ‘part-of-speech classes’; they are the building blocks of
linguistic structures. Grammatical categories are either open or closed. Open categories
contain a virtually unlimited number of items, while closed categories have a limited set
of members. In Abui, open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed
grammatical categories are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers,
adverbs and question words.
        In Abui, many lexical items appear to be ambiguous. Their categorial
membership must be determined by the combination of their distributional, functional,
and semantic properties (cf. Schachter, 1985; Andward et al., 1997). With the term
‘distributional properties’ I refer to the word-internal (morphological) and word-
external (syntactic) distribution of an item. In section 3.1, I give an overview of Abui
morphology describing various morpheme types (bound, free, prefixes, suffixes, roots,
and stems).
        Word-external (syntactic) distributional properties refer to the status of items in
syntactic units such as phrases, clauses and sentences. Items may be restricted in their
distribution within syntactic units; not all items may occur as heads. Items have
different functional properties. They can express various grammatical functions such as
arguments, aspectual markers, or linkers. Finally, items can have a different type of
reference (time-stable or versatile) and different referents (persons, events, etc.).
        In section 3.2, I describe nouns. Nouns are items that canonically refer to time-
stable concepts such as persons, objects or places. The nominal reference is permanent.
Pronouns are discussed in section 3.3. Pronouns refer to time-stable concepts,
however, their reference is not permanent as the nominal reference but versatile and
context dependent. In section 3.4, I discuss Abui verbs. Verbs are defined
morphologically as items that may combine with REC pronominal prefix and aspectual
markers. Syntactically, they are the head of a verb phrase. Verbs serve as predicates in a
clause and may combine with arguments.
        The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of closed grammatical
categories; they are discussed in section 3.5. The closed grammatical categories are
adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2), quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4),
conjunction markers (3.5.6), adverbs (3.5.5), and question words (3.5.7).","[88, 89, 90]"

"MORPHOLOGY. Abui can be characterized as an agglutinating polysynthetic language.
Nouns tend to be morphologically simple; the possessive inflection is the only nominal
inflection. Verbs tend to be morphologically complex; they are inflected for person and
aspect. In (2), I give an overview of morphological structures found in Abui. Words
consist minimally of a free root (i). Free roots may combine with optional morphemes,
prefixes (ii), suffixes (iii), bound roots (iv), or both prefix and suffix (v). Free roots may
form a complex stem with a bound root and still combine with affixes (vi). A number
of roots are bound; they obligatorily combine with prefixes (vii), suffixes (viii), or both
of them (ix), other bound roots (x), bound roots and suffixes (xi), or all of them (xii) to
form a word.

Abui distinguishes open and closed grammatical categories.
Open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed grammatical categories
are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers, adverbs, and question
words. There is a closed set of generic verbs which are monosegmental roots and have
a number of grammatical functions in argument realization and verb derivation.","[35, 36]"

‘fall’ sharing a single argument. It refers to the location near the speaker where the
referred object ‘fell’:(168) di      ma         ha-yei?
      3A      be.PRX 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘did it fall here (by me)?’                                         [B05.083.02]Although both verbs in (168) have each their own argument, both pronouns expressing
the arguments have the same reference. The free pronoun di (3A) is the A argument of
the deictic verb ma ‘be.PRX’ while the PAT prefix ha- is the U argument of the verb yei
‘fall’. The minor verb in (168) expresses an event location while in (169) it expresses
potential modality. The minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ expresses an attitude of the speaker
towards the event expressed by the major verb. The major verb is inflected for aspect
with imperfective suffix -e (IPFV).(169) di      ma         do-làk-e
      3A      be.PRX     3I.REC-leave.for-IPFV

  8.4.4.2       SVC with ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
The minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ encodes the addressee-proximate location of the event.
This is illustrated in example (170) analogous to previous (168) where the minor verb ta
‘be.PRX.AD’ combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ sharing a single argument:(170) di     ta           ha-yei?
      3A     be.PRX.AD 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘did he fall near you?’                                             [B05.083.02]In (171) both proximal deictic verbs are contrasted in the same SVC. Note that the
minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ used in a question presupposes the same location of the
speaker with the addressee as illustrated in (a). However, the minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
refers simply to the location of the addressee, regardless the location of speaker.
Logically the speaker is located elsewhere than the addressee in such situation because
otherwise the verb ma ‘be.PRX’ would be used:(171) a. anui ma              o-pa=ng                    sei?

   8.4.4.3     SVC with la ‘be.MD’
The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ expresses a medial (less proximate) event location with
respect to the speaker. The construction is used in situations when the speech
participants talk about events occurring in other locations that are distant from them.
This is illustrated in (100) where the speaker inquires whether the addressee is going to
stay over night in the harbour town encoded as la ‘be.MD’ or come back to the village
where they are both located at that time:(172) a       la        taa re a-wai?
      2SG be.MD lie            or 2SG.PAT-turn
      ‘will you sleep there or come back?’                                       [B04.009.02]In example (173) the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used in a very complex utterance that
uses a number of SVCs. Ignoring the first two clauses, in the third clause the minor
verb la ‘be.MD’ combines with the major verb yaari ‘go’, together with the other two
minor verbs pa ‘touch’ and ng ‘see’ expressing the motion towards a proximate
recipient. The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used to stress that the location where the
speaker ‘arrived’ is actually distant from his location at the moment of speech:(173) di       he-n          de-l          binen-r-i        ba      me     mai   se    na

       ‘he was getting ready for it to come when I arrived to him there’         [B07.037.03]The location verb SVC with the verb la ‘be.MD’ has a functional extension expressing
modality. It expresses speaker’s opinion that the event expressed with the major verb
happens ‘autonomously’ according its own will. The event is presented as ‘distant’ from
the speaker as illustrated in (174). The addressee is expressed as the A argument of the
minor verb la ‘be.MD’ and major verbs we ‘leave’ and me ‘come’. The speaker expresses
his lack of understanding why the addressee just keeps walking around:(174) a      la       we la           me do, a              nala tahai?
      2SG be.MD leave be.MD come PRX 2SG what search
      ‘you, you only go and come, so what are you searching?’                    [B05.033.03]In fact the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ indicates that the reported event is performed outside
the deictic centre, and ‘autonomously’ of speaker’s intention and awareness of its
reason; however, this construction can be analyzed as realis marking strategy as it
confirms that the event is truly happening. This is illustrated in (175) where (A) inquires
whether (B) is already asleep. (B) uses la ‘be.MD’ to express that he is unable to sleep.
He says that he is just lying ‘there’, while he is in the same location with the speaker.

takes place ‘autonomously’ of speaker’s expectation. In (176) the minor verb la ‘be.MD’
combines with yei ‘fall’ sharing a single argument wata ‘coconut’.(176) wata       la         ha-yei
      coconut be.MD 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘the coconut fell suddenly’                                                      [B07.073.01]
   8.4.4.4   SVC with fa ‘be.MD.AD’
The minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ refers to an event location distant from the addressee.
The use of fa implicates realis mode as it marks ‘truly’ occurring events. As realis mode
marker it has also contrastive epistemic function identifying that the information is
either new or unknown to the addressee. The verb fa corresponds roughly in its use to
English ‘actually’. In (101) it is contrasted with two other deictic verbs ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
and la ‘be.MD’ combined in all cases with the major verb sei ‘come down’:(177) a. anui ta                 sei?                      b. anui la            sei

of a questioned car. Note that the deictic verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ corresponds in usage to the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD).","[426, 427, 428, 429]"

addressee. It seems to be a general strategy in Abui, as in most or all languages, that the
temporal and discourse dimension and their operators are mostly transferred from the

example is given in (179) where the verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ combines with rul ‘take off’:(179) di      fa              de-namang ha-rul                 ba      ko    da-wel

   8.4.4.5    SVC with ya ‘be.DST’
The minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ expresses an event location distal from both speech
participants. Its use is illustrated in (180) where the minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ combines
with the verb -iel ‘roast’. In (a) the speaker is located outside the shelter where he is
roasting a fish for the addressee. In such context, he is marked ‘distal’ from the event
location. In (b) the minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ is used because the speaker is roasting a
fish for the addressee inside the shelter, while the addressee is outside:(180) a. na      ya         e-afu          walanga-i         h-iel

evidential function marking the event as non-witnessed by the speaker but as one that
really happened expressing in fact realis mode. This is illustrated in the narrative
fragment in (181):(181) he-maama         do      wan       ya        do-beka

speaker, but that he is reporting a narrative, that is: an event that occurred in a distal
time from the moment of speech.","[429, 430]"

  7.3.2.3     Semantic contribution of the initial root
In this section, I analyse the function of the initial GV in a complex verb as describing
something that will be referred to as the ‘locus’ of the event, or the spatial constellation
of the event. As suggested in section 7.3.2 and illustrated in (76), the initial generic root
of a homogeneous CV is related to the locus of the event. A large paradigm is given in
(114). Because of their final verb k, all these verbs refer to events that are classified as
motions, while the medial verb a ‘be at’ indicates that the event has no internal
boundary. The initial verb is variable, and indicates the spatial constellation of the
event.(114) t-a-k           ‘bring down, shoot, empty’                  s-a-k             ‘move along, pass along’
      lie-be.at-bring                                             lie.ICP-be.at-bring
         p-a-k           ‘bring at, slap’                         d-a-k               ‘clutch, trap’
         touch-be.at-bring                                        hold-be.at-bring
         b-a-k              ‘swallow, snatch’                     f-a-k               ‘break’
         join-be.at-bring                                         sever-be.at-bring
         l-a-k              ‘mark, count’                         w-a-k               ‘abandon, embrace’
         give-be.at-bring                                         bring-be.at-bring
15 Here, a large body of literature on Aktionsart and the established classifications as states, activities,
accomplishments, and achievements (Vendler 1967) is reffered to. More specifically, the distinctions between stative
[−ADD TO] and dynamic [+ADD TO] made by (Verkuyl 1972) are particularly interesting, and later quantized
and cumulative feature (Krifka 1998).

        As ‘locus’ marking derivational morphemes, initial generic verbs take a
perspective that is quite different from what we are used to in derivational morphology.
For example, the verb t ‘lie’ indicates a horizontal ‘locus’ that is reached by the motion
(expressed by k ‘bring’). The verb s ‘lie’ indicates a parallel ‘locus’. The verb p ‘touch’
indicates a locus that may be described as ‘touching of a surface’, while the root d ‘hold’
encodes that the event involves an ‘overall’ type of contact between participants and
their location. The root b ‘join’ indicates an intersecting locus, while the root f ‘sever’
refers to a separated locus. The root l ‘give’ refers to a locus that may be described as
‘in reach’. Practically it means that the involved participants are ‘in reach’ of each other,
but more distant from each other than e.g. when the generic verb is p ‘touch’ or b ‘join’.
At the same time the participants are still within reach of each other, unlike the
participants in cases when the roots u ‘leave’ (pronounced and written as w in initial
position) and f ‘sever’ are used. The verb u ‘leave’ indicates the remote locus. The verb
ì/y ‘put’ was illustrated in (87); it indicates an overlay locus. A summary is given in Table

        Each of the CVs given in (114) is exemplified in (115)-(126). The CV t-a-k was
discussed previously in (80)-(83), (98), and (99). The CV s-a-k is given in (115). It refers
to bamboo moving along each other and being of no further use because the board is

The stem d-a-k is also used to refer to fish and mouse traps. The bamboo traps referred
to with the stem dak clutch an animal after the trigger part is touched. In (120), the CV
b-a-k is illustrated. It refers to motion away from the DC with locus described as
‘intersection’ corresponding to the English verb ‘snatch’. It combines with the free

DC affecting the ‘house’ that is ‘in reach’ of the event. The CV l-a-k combines with the
prefix ha- (3II.PAT) co-indexing the NP fala ‘house’ as patient. Its meaning corresponds

In (125), the CV w-a-k refers to a motion oriented away from the DC. The locus of the
event is encoded with the root w ‘leave’. It indicates the ‘remoteness’ of the
participants. The CV w-a-k is related to the CV w-o-k ‘throw’. The U argument of the
CV w-a-k is the NP ni-ya maama o ‘mother and father’. The verb refers to
‘abandoning’ of parents by their children.(125) ni-ya              maama o          wat                    he

prefix ta- (DISTR.PAT). It refers to ‘embracing’ of two participants. This is encoded as a
motion away from the DC. The root w ‘leave’ indicates the remote locus. Because both
participants are affected they are co-indexed as patients on the CV.(126) di ning      ayoku ta-w-a-k                         ba             luuk do=ng          we

descriptions of events from a perspective that is radically different from that of more
familiar languages. The paradigms suggest that the question of lexicalization cannot be
answered without intensive further research.
        Some more paradigms of the CVs with alternating first root are given below. In
(127), the root m ‘be in’ encodes the event locus as being in the same location.(127) p-a-ng              ‘feel, shape, form’          m-a-ng-               ‘possess’

       lie-be.at-see                                   join-be.at-seeIn (128), all verbs contain the final root l ‘give’ that indicates that the event is externally
caused. The root u ‘leave’ refers to the event that reached its final boundary and has
persistent effect. The initial roots encode the locus. As discussed in the initial part of
this section, the root f ‘sever’ refers to the separation locus of two participants. The
root k ‘bring’ refers to locus that is not in reach but not too remote. The root r ‘reach’
refers to the locus where participants were previously in ‘in reach or fixed’ of each
other. Finally, the root t ‘lie’ refers to horizontal locus of the participants.(128) f-u-l            ‘swallow’                       k-u-l                 ‘throw’

The use of the CV r-u-l is illustrated in (129) and (130). In (129), the CV combines
with two arguments. The A argument is expressed with the free pronoun di (3A). The U
argument is the NP de-namang ‘her own clothes’ and co-indexed with the prefix ha-
(3II.PAT) as patient on the CV. It corresponds to the English verb ‘take off’ because it
combines with the argument ‘clothes’.(129) di fa            de-namang ha-r-u-l                 ba             ko     da-wel

r-u-l is the NP de-kafiei ‘his goat’. The CV r-u-l corresponds in this case to the English
verb ‘untie’.","[359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364]"
"   8.3.1.3    SVC with re ‘reach’
SVC with the minor verb re ‘reach’ encodes the initial point of an event. The inceptive
stem of the verb re ‘reach’ alternates sometimes with the continuative stem ra ‘reach,
attempt’. The stem re/ra ‘reach’ displays except stem alternation also other verbal
properties, such as aspectual and person inflection.9 Abui speakers often translate re/ra
with the Malay verb coba ‘try, attempt’. An example is given in (34) where the major
verb tulok ‘stab’ is serialized with the minor verb re ‘reach’:(34)    me        ne-l              tulok      re
        come 1SG.LOC-give         stab         reach.ICP
        ‘if you dare, come and stab me’                                                   [B10.020.09]In the following case re is serialized with minang ‘remember’ that combines with two
U arguments. The prefix a- (2SG.PAT) refers to the experiencer of ‘remembering’. The
LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC) refers to the remembered matter. Both verbs share their
aspectual inflection; the perfective suffix -i (PFV) appears on the final minor verb only.
The aspectual inflection of the form re proves its verbhood.(35)    he-a-minang                    re-i!
        3II.LOC-2SG.PAT-remember reach.ICP-PFV

with re. Both major verbs in (36) marei ‘go up’ and rimaldi ‘turn’ combine with the
inceptive aspectual marker se (INCP.I). This marker is the only aspectual inflection that
may intervene between the major and minor verb. The inceptive marker se (INCP.I) and
the minor verb re ‘reach’ have similar functions. Both forms refer to the initial point of
9It is unclear whether the form re ‘or’ is related to this verbal form. The verb ra/re ‘try, attempt’ may
originate as complex verb in generic roots r ‘reach’ and a ‘be at’, e ‘add’.

inceptive marker te (INCP.C); the minor verb re ‘reach’ combines with the perfective
suffix -i (PFV) that is shared by both verbs:(37)   kawen       ba      [topa      nu]RC      ong      bul-r-i=te                 re-i!

       ‘sharpen now finally that blunt machete!’                  [B05.040.09]The minor verb re ‘reach’ sometimes combines with sai ‘put along’ to refer to events,
that might possibly happen, or happen randomly anywhere. This is illustrated in (38). In
(a), the major verb kafering ‘horrify’ combines with re and sai expressing that the
second person participant might ‘become evil’. In the first clause, the second person
singular participant is realized as the U argument of the verb do ‘hold’ with the LOC
prefix e- (2SG.LOC). For more information about the attributive serial construction with
the verb d-o ‘hold’, see section 8.4.2.2. In (b), both verbs combine with the verb nee-i
‘eat’. In both cases the clause contains either the location question word te ‘where’ or a
temporal adverb. Some more examples can be found in 8.3.3.2.(38)   a. e-d-o                       beka,      ko       o-kafering          re            sai

inflection (see 8.1.1), this is not always the case. In aspectual ASVC.I, the major verb may
be inflected for aspect too, typically with the inceptive markers se/te (INCP). The
aspectual properties of the inceptive markers are similar to the aspect contributed by
the verb re ‘reach’.
        The verb re ‘reach’ often occurs in imperative constructions. Two instances are
given in (39). Note that in (b) the verb re ‘reach’ follows the negator naha (NEG) which
indicates that two verbs are not serialized here. As marked with the brackets, the verb
re ‘reach’ is here the main verb while the preceding clause serves as its complement.

The verb tik ‘stretch’ occurs as the minor verb in an ASVC.I to indicate a postponed
final point of the event. This is illustrated in (40), where the major verb wel ‘pour’ is
serialized with the minor verb tik ‘stretch’ in (a). In (b), the major verb wel ‘pour’
combines with two minor verbs: tik ‘stretch’ and loida ‘lengthen’. In both cases, the
minor verbs combine with the prefix ha- (3II.PAT) that refers to the first part of the
serial verb construction that functions as a complement of the minor verb.(40)       a. [Simon         di da-wel]complement        la=ng           ha-tik

nasal velar [ŋ], all consonants occur also word initially. The coda position is relatively
more restricted than the onset position. Only eight consonants are allowed in word-
final coda position: /t, k, m, n, ŋ, r, l, j/. The word-medial coda position is even more
restricted, as it allows only five consonants: /k, m, n, ŋ, r/. There is a clear asymmetry
in the distribution of /j/ and /w/. The glide /j/ occurs as coda while /w/ does not
occur as coda. A similar asymmetry is also found among liquids, as the liquid /r/ is
found in word-medial codas across the lexicon, while the liquid /l/ is only found in
word-medial coda position in complex verbs.","[57, 58]"

  8.3.5.2    SVC with wa / wi ‘be like.MD’
The minor verb wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ refer to the way or manner in which the event was
performed. This type of manner may be considered as ‘medial’, it is obvious to both
speech participants; however, this type is often used in questions, because the speaker
wants to indicate lower awareness of the manner in which an event was performed. The13 This strategy is in fact a form of tail head linkage (THL), a typical feature of for many Papuan languages (cf.de Vries, 2005). In Abui usually last clause is recapitulated in THL constructions. The final verb of
recapitulated clause combines with an complex index verb.

referred manner is expressed by the complement that precedes the index verb. In (75)
the major verb ayong ‘swim’ is serialized with the complex verb wi-d-a ‘become like
that’ that serves as minor verb. The first complement is a clause, while the second
complement is a part of serial verb construction.(75)   [di ayong do,]CC [afu he-n-u                            ayong]complement

       ‘he swims like a fish’, lit.: ‘given he swims, he does (so) like a fish swims’     [B07.053.02]Both verbs share the A argument of the verb ayong ‘swim’ realized with the NP afu
‘fish’. The verb ayong ‘swim’ occurs also in the first clause and combines with a
different A argument expressed as the free pronoun di (3A). Logically the verb wida has
to share the argument expressed as the NP afu ‘fish’ with the second verb. It is not
clear whether the verb wi-d-a ‘become like that’ has a second argument. It seems to be
linked in a paratactic topic-comment structure with the first clause di ayong do ‘he
swims’.
         In (76) a fragment of the Lord’s prayer is given. The verb wi-d-a ‘become like
that’ is serialized with the verb mi-a ‘be in’ to express the manner in which the earth
should be. The bracketed structure melang san mi-a ‘be in heaven’ serves as a
complement of the verb wi-d-a ‘become like that’. The second argument of the verb
wi-d-a ‘become like that’ is expressed with the complement clause buku taha mi-a do
‘be on earth’. Observe also that the VP structure o-mi ‘inside you’ is nominalized in a
possessive construction (see also 8.4.2.3).(76)   [o-mi]nominal he-san           he-masolang mi ni-l,                     [buku tah-a

verb ma ‘be.PRX’ combines with the REC prefix that expresses the speaker as
experiencer of the disapproval.(77)   no-ma                  wa                    naha

374                                   CHAPTER VIII
  8.3.5.3     SVC with ha ‘be like.DST’
In SVCs, the index verb ha ‘be like.DST’ refers to a manner of way of performing an
event that is new to the addressee and can be considered as ‘distal’. An example
contrasting with (75) is given in (78) below. The minor verb hari ‘make somehow’ is
complex. It combines with the major verb ayon ‘swim’. Both verbs share the aspectual
inflection that is expressed on the minor verb.(78)   di      [afu he-n-u                 ayon]complement ha-r-i
       3A    fish 3II.LOC-be.like.PRX-PRF swim.CPL          be.like.DST.CNT-reach-PFV
       ‘he swam like a fish somehow’                                        [B07.053.02]In imperative construction the verb ha ‘be like.DST’ may occur serialized as simple verb,
not being part of a complex verb. However, in indicative constructions derived forms
tend to be used. Consider now example (79) where the minor verbs ha ‘be like.DST’ and
hal ‘make somehow’ occur serialized with the major verb reng ‘turn to’. In (a) ha is
used in imperative construction; in indicative construction hal ‘make somehow’ must
be used instead. In both cases the serialized verbs share the A argument: a (2SG) in (a),
di (3A) in (b). The U argument of the minor verbs ha and hal is the NP oto ‘car’. The
phrase war sei ‘sun descends, west’ together with the bound pronoun ha- (3II.PAT) is
the U argument of the major verb reng ‘turn to’.(79)   a. a      oto   mi ba war sei             ha-reng             ha!

8.4         Asymmetrical Serial Verb Constructions type II
Asymmetrical SVCs of type II are composed of a grammatically restricted verb (the
‘minor’ verb) followed by an open-class verb (the ‘major’ verb, see also 8.1.2). The
major verb identifies the event and the minor verb has a grammatical function relating
to argument realization and describing event settings. The ordering of the minor and
major verb is parallel to Abui clause structure. In a clause, adverbial modifiers and
arguments precede the VP. On semantic grounds, the major verb can be considered as
the head of the serial construction. Syntactically, the notion of head is problematic, as
the valence of the major verb does not necessarily correspond to the valence of the
whole structure (cf. Aikhenvald, 2006:29).
        In this section, asymmetrical SVCs of type II are discusses according to the
verb-class of the minor verb. In sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.2 I discuss asymmetrical SVCs
that are used mainly in argument realization. In section 8.4.2 I describe asymmetrical

SVCs in which the minor verb belongs to the generic-verb class. The quantification
SVCs are discussed in 8.4.3. In section 8.4.4, I give an overview of SVCs with minor
verbs belonging to the deictic-verb class. SVCs with minor verbs from the positional-
verb class are discussed in section 8.4.5. These SVCs express the position of the
participants involved in the event. The second type of manner SVCs is described
section 8.4.6, it expresses participant oriented manner and differs from the manner
SVC described in 8.3.3 which is event oriented. In section 8.4.7, I discuss the second
type of modal SVCs, which expresses participant oriented modality and differs from the
modal SVC discussed in 8.3.4 which expresses event oriented modality.","[395, 396, 397, 398]"

The research reported here was conducted in the context of M.A.F. Klamer’s
‘Vernieuwingsimpuls’-project ‘Linguistic variation in Eastern Indonesia’ funded by the
Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). Fieldwork in 2004 was funded by
the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project.
      AcknowledgementsThis book is a linguistic account of an amazing journey. As a small boy I used to hear
stories about Indonesia from my father’s friend who worked there and found it the
most beautiful place on Earth. Later, during my studies in Nijmegen, I took courses in
Indonesian and fieldwork methods, and became convinced that I could travel to those
remote islands myself and describe a language.
        The first step of this journey started in Leiden in 2002. My whole-hearted
thanks belong to those who guided me patiently along the journey, and whom, as the
tradition dictates, I may not name.
        Many people accompanied me as the journey unfolded. In Leiden, I owe thanks
to my colleagues at Leiden University Centre for Linguistics for teaching, reading,
listening, good friendship, joyful company, culinary treats, and any possible
combination of these. They are Alwin Kloekhorst, Amir Tauber, Anikó Liptak, Aone

Vincent van Heuven. I would also like to thank Nelleke Goudswaard and Wilco van
den Heuvel for taking care of practical issues concerning language description.
        In Indonesia, I found hospitality and friends in many places. I thank Uri
Tadmor for sharing his fine home in Jakarta and his colleagues at MPI Field station,
Antonia Soriente and Betty Litamahuputty for a fine company. I am pleased to
acknowledge the official support that I have received from MPI Field station Jakarta
and in particular from Dr. Uri Tadmor as well as from Universitas Atma Jaya, Jakarta
and in particular from Professor Bambang Kaswanti Purwo. I owe many thanks to
Andreas Wijaya, Obing Katubi, Anisah Kortshak, Yunus Riadi Herman, Arnoldus Arif
Kusuma for their friendship and merry company and to Dani Martati for her delicious
cooking and care.
        In Kupang, June Jacob, John Haan, Flori Lake, Christo and Ben always helped
me around. Universitas Kristen Arthawacana Kupang supported my research. When I
stayed with Madah Biha’s family, it felt like home. I also thank Bapak Arkilaus Sabu and
Elias Ndiwa and their families for their great hospitality.
        Once the journey reached Alor, Karsten van der Oord introduced me to the
family of Chris Dani, who looked after me in Kalabahi and shared their home and
delicious food. Karsten took me out for diving, bought me strong liquors, told me a lot
about Alor and taught me how to chew betel nut. Sister Christa, Sister Gisela, Romo
Polce and Romo Toni showed me the pure and humble face of christianity. Many
thanks are directed to Andreas Malaikosa and Neil Johnston from SIL branch Alor. I
also thank Daniel Bekak and Ans Takalapeta who supported my research in Alor.

        Karsten van der Oord introduced me to Timoteus, Amalia, Dori, Orpa and
Simon Lanma, who took me in their family and treated me as their own. They taught
me their ‘straight’ language, as they call it. They took care of me in times of illness and
discomfort and made me laugh on so many occasions. I thank Benidiktus Delpada and
Waksi Maufani, who carried the daily linguistic burden with me, and they carried it so
well. I thank my little friends Fani, Fan Ata, Eman, Simon-Kakak, Lon-Rut, Orpa, and
Peni for taking me for trips to the jungle and teaching me so many things. I also thank
Nelis, Eben, Ande, Loni, Hilde, Nani, Lon Fan for being good villagers. I thank Bapak
Penku, Bapak Vinsen, Bapak Maiku, Bapak Aliku, Bapak Ande, Bapa Elias, and many
others for sharing their stories and language with me. They were tried to teach me the
‘straight’ Abui, but I am afraid it is still quite twisted.
        The first two trips I made together with Louise Baird and Peter Newman. They
looked after me in many ways wherever I went or stayed: in Leiden, Indonesia, and
Australia. Louise was a frustratingly hard-working officemate and a wonderful
colleague.
        In Australia, I am grateful to Bill Foley for valuable comments on many matters,
especially on generic verbs. I thank Andrew Pawley for his support and sharing his
knowledge. John Hajek helped me with Abui tones. I also thank John Bowden, Mark
Donohue and Gary Holton.
        Along the journey, I met my paranymph Floris Scheplitz. Floris accompanied
me on my last trip to Alor, conducting his own ethnobotanic research. It was a true
pleasure having him and Marloes around. I was blessed with the company of the
gentlemen Freek Otte, Eric Thomassen, Martin Vink, Frank de Wever, and Fred
Hamburg, with whom I spent many hours in De Bonte Koe and De Burcht, discussing
sacral and secular issues passionately. I thank Lewis Mayo, Julian Millie, Rati and Joe,
Ivana Hladká, Gershon Kaigere for their cheerful company and many nice dinners.
        I would like to thank my old friends Gerard van Poppel, Jasper van der Weerd,
the late Sjef van Tilborg, Tim Sparla, Tom Willems, Ineke de Kort, Lisette Crooijmans,
Kees van Dongen and Mieke Hoedemakers (with Berend and Willem) in Nijmegen;
Roy van Rijt en Hilde Beurskens in Haelen; Klaas en Anja Visser in Beemster; Kitty,
Marino, Sjoerd (and octopuses), Tijs, and Bas in Rijen; Kamila Krupičková, Johan
Deknopper, Fred Stroobants in Belgium, Martijn Cooijmans in London; and Tomáš
Langášek and Michal Kramář in the Czech Republic, for always being there even when
I was not there. Reinoud, Rienje and Jan visited me in Takalelang and cooked me plenty
good dinners. Thomas made it to Alor only in the belly, but was our companion in all
the following adventures.
        The Eastern European connection was taken care of by Boban Arsenijević, my
second paranymph, and his graceous company Dunce and Lidija. He appreciates
generic verbs, slivowitz, absurdity and melodramatic sentiment and knows that without
these, one gets easily lost, being far from one’s homeland.
        Joanna Sio became another eastern connection. She taught me to appreciate
general knowlegde, food-related metaphors and convinced me to move to Hong Kong.
Joanna helped me through the last months of writing this book.
        At the end of a proper journey, one should go home. I thank my family in the
Czech Republic for allowing me to go and learn that villages on the other side of this
planet are not that different from Dobroutov, the little village where we come from. I
remember those who passed away while I was not there.

                            1 Introduction
This book is a description of Abui, a Papuan language spoken on Alor Island in eastern
Indonesia. It presents essential parts of Abui grammar in a theoretically neutral way.
        This chapter contains some general information about Abui, its speakers and the
area in which Abui is spoken. This chapter is organised in the following fashion. The
geographic position of the area where Abui is spoken is defined in section 1.1. The
genetic affiliation of Abui, together with a brief overview of the historical sources
concerning Alor Island and Abui people, is discussed in section 1.2. In section 1.3 I
give some general information about the Abui community, the number of speakers,
their typical occupation and way of living. The linguistic situation of the area where
Abui is spoken is described in section 1.4. Information about the contexts in which
Abui is used and about language endangerment will also be included in this section. In
section 1.5 I give an overview of previous linguistic efforts focused on Abui; and in 1.6
I discuss Abui genetic affiliation. I present a typological sketch of Abui in section 1.7.
Section 1.8 discusses how the language data was collected. It describes the fieldwork
and gives some basic information about the language consultants. Section 1.9 deals with
composition of the corpus and gives a list of recorded texts that are included in it.
Section 1.10 gives an outline of this book and introduces the conventions in which the
language data will be presented.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"  6.4.3.1     Anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX)
The anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) indicates the temporal location of an event as
proximate to the moment of speech when it is the final constituent of a sentence, such
as in (234). The demonstrative do (PRX) combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ to indicate
that the event of ‘falling’ just occurred.(234) da-kur             ba     aka=ng      ha-yei         do
      3I.PAT-jump.CPL LNK outside=see       3II.PAT-fall   PRX
      ‘he jumped, fell outside’                                           [B02.167.06.05]The temporal location of the event is not by definition in the past. It is any proximate
location in time, as illustrated in (235). The speaker complains that his arm hurts.
Because of it he will not be able to shoot with the bow.

       ‘my hand really hurts, so will not be able to do anything like this’        [B09.006.06:27]When anaphoric demonstratives occur between two clauses or phrases, they indicate
the discourse location of the event. This is illustrated in (236) where the demonstrative
do (PRX) follows the clause di ning ayoku ‘they are two’. The demonstrative do (PRX)
seems to mark the first clause as background information for the second clause. It is
followed by an intonational pause, marked in the example with a comma.(236) [luka-luka ya           yoikoi     di ning             ayoku    do,]clause

       ‘monkey and turtle, they were just two of them, they told to each other’ [B06.044.01:48]In (237), two instances of do (PRX) are given. In (a), the anaphoric demonstrative do
(PRX) locates the event of ‘singing’ expressed by the first clause as being proximate to
‘weeding’. It is a type of a ‘when’ clause that presents the background information for
the event expressed in the second clause. In (b), its function is analogous. It indicates
that the event of ‘whirlwinds being bad’ co-occurs with the ‘continuous rain’. The
anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) has a nominalising effect on the clause presenting is
as background information for the event described in the second clause. In fact, the
first phrase is ambiguous and may be also interpreted as an NP because anaphoric
demonstratives also occur as final constituents in NPs.(237) a. [di     yai panen            do,]clause [do-baloka ber-i-a]clause

             ‘during the rainy season it rains only’                             [B07.044.04]In (238), the first clause contains the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX). Note that the
argument of the verb luuk ‘dance’ is not accessible for the reference of the free
pronoun di (3A) in the second clause. This example illustrates that there are no pivots
for cross-clause coreference in Abui. In this fragment of the Fuluk Munuma narrative,
the free pronoun di (3A) refers to a young man and woman who chew their betel nut
while other people are dancing.

      ‘while people were dancing, the two were eating their betel nut’         [B02.087.08:17]Anaphoric demonstratives may occur in clauses which express paratactic complements,
as in (239), where the first clause expresses one of the arguments of the verb fal
‘separate’ in the second clause.(239) [di nala         nee do,]CC [nu-fal                           naha]clause

      ‘he ate without us’, lit.: ‘given that he ate something, he did not separate for us’The anaphoric demonstratives typically occur as final constituent in complement
clauses such as in (240). It has a nominalising effect on the complement clause which
may be analyzed as a nominal, because it expresses the U argument of the verb ng ‘see’.
The verb ng ‘see’ combines with the verb we ‘leave’ in allative serial verb construction
(see 8.4.2.1). Note, that there is no specialized complementizer in Abui, but the
complement clauses occur in syntactic position of an argument and often combine with
anaphoric demonstratives that seem to serve as nominalizing devices.(240) pulang [na-pong             pe      do]CC=ng            we-i

the locational verb hanah-a ‘put between’ is used in a ULOC-UREC transitive
construction (see 6.2.3.6) expressing the complement of the verb ng ‘see’ which
combines with the verb we ‘leave’ in allative serial verb construction. Observe that the
free pronoun di (3I) precedes the complement.(241) he’e, di [he-to-hanah-a                               do]CC=ng            we

      ‘yes, he went to (the place that is) in between then’                        [B10.003.03:15]In larger text fragments, the anaphoric demonstrative often has a nominalising
function. As illustrated in the following fragment from the narrative moku ayoku, the
information presented in one clause chain is resumed in the initial part of the next
clause chain and marked as background information with an anaphoric demonstrative.
The direct speech given in (242) is resumed in the first clause of (243) and marked with
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) as background information. The clause ya si-a
‘fetch water’ serves as a complement clause (CC) of the verb generic n ‘see’ that
combines with the verb we ‘leave’ in a purpose serial verb constriction (see 8.4.2.1).

from (243) is resumed as the initial part of the clause chain. Note that the NP baleei
wataka ‘banana blossom’ that is introduced in the first clause is also the implicit U
argument of the verb mi ‘take’.(244) [di baleei wataka do          kek            he-we   do,]clause        mi miei

used frequently in Abui narratives (see texts in Appendix for more examples). Tail-head
linkage is a typical feature of many Papuan languages (cf. De Vries, 2005).","[306, 307, 308, 309]"

6.4.2      Affirmative predicate markers
Affirmative predicate markers affirm predicates. That means that they mark them as
‘true’. Their function is inverted negation. There are two affirmative predicate markers
in Abui: ba and bai (discussed in 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2). Both items are identified as verbs,
because they may combine with person and aspectual inflection. Both markers are
related, in fact they are a grammaticalization of the verb ba ‘say’ which is used when
direct speech is quoted, as illustrated in (222) where the verb ba ‘say’ follows a direct
speech and combines with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC).15(222) ‘ah Karfe Hawa moku loku do                     taki!’              he-ba

      ‘oh, Karfe-Hawa, the children fled away’ they said                                  [B02.045.16:09]This verb has developed, next to its affirmative functions, also to a relator, complement
marker, and an intersective linker in both nominal and verbal domain (see also 3.5.6
and 4.5).16   6.4.2.1     Affirmative predicate marker ba
The affirmative predicate marker ba ‘say’ affirms the true value of a predicate. Its use is
illustrated in (223). The marker ba ‘say’ indicates that the child that is described as
‘shivering’ in the preceding clause perhaps ‘is’ ill. The first clause expresses the topic of
the predicate, which is expressed in the second clause. Structurally, the construction
reminds of the copula clauses given in section 4.5, example (122).(223) [moku nuku oro raharak-d-i-a                          do]clause [yang ha-rik]          ba

      ‘the child over there is shivering, it is perhaps ill’                          [B05.060.04]In (224), the marker ba ‘say’ follows the index verb na ‘be like.PRX’. Also this structure
is related to the copula clauses mentioned above. However, as the complement itself is
verbal, the verb ba ‘say’ has acquired the affirmative function.(224) [ma]topic         [na]complement        bacopula/affirmative marker

both conversation turns. One of the participants inquires whether the solicitors ‘will’
start bargaining. One solicitor answers that they ‘do’ intend to do so.","[302, 303]"

‘come up’. The speaker is filled up by the rice that he consumed. The LOC prefix he-
(3II.LOC) co-indexes the NP sieng ma ‘cooked rice’, while the REC prefix no- (1SG.REC)
expresses the first person participant as an involuntary experiencer (see also 6.2.3.6).(76)   sieng ma            he-no-maran-i

  6.1.2.2     Person inflection and valence of bound verb stems
In this section, I show how person inflection and valence vary in a number of VPs
headed by bound verb stems such as -yei ‘fall’, -rik ‘hurt’, and -loi ‘put far’.
       In the VPs exemplified in (77)-(81), the bound verb stem yei ‘fall’ occurs as the
head verb. In (77), the VP contains the PAT pronominal prefix ha- (3II.PAT) that
expresses the U argument. The pronoun refers to the NP moku fila ‘small child’. The 3I
prefix da- (3I.PAT) cannot combine with the verb -yei ‘fall’ as the event of ‘falling’ is
never controlled by the affected participant.(77)   moku fila              lik             ha-pong          mi-a       ha-yei

As illustrated in (78), a VP headed by -yei ‘fall’ cannot combine with an A argument.
The first person actor is realized as the A argument of the verb ong ‘make’ with the free
pronoun na (1SG) as in (62) ong ha-mong ‘cause to die’.(78)   na     yambuk       ong     ha-yei

construction (see 6.2.3.8). The PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT) refers to the NP bataa tuku
‘piece of wood’ while the REC prefix o- (2SG.REC) refers to the human goal of the
motion.(79)   na bataa tuku ong           ha-yei        mai=se               la       o-ha-yei

person participants to be expressed with the PAT prefix. Instead, a serial verb
construction must be used, as illustrated in (81), where the verb -yei ‘fall’ combines
with a U argument expressed with the third person prefix ha- (3II.PAT). The first person
undergoer is specified as the malefactive with the LOC prefix ne- (1SG.LOC) attached to
the verb -l ‘give’ (see also 8.4.2.4).(81)   ne-l            ong       ha-yei

In (82), the verb -rik ‘hurt’ combines with a single prefix, expressing the single U
argument of the verb (see 6.2.4.5).(82)   a. na-rik                   b. ni-rik              ba-i,   a        mahi-a            naha

In (83), the VP contains a single prefix but combines with two arguments. In (a), the
second argument is questioned with nala ‘what’. In (b), the second argument of the
verb is the NP na-táng ‘my arm’ which is the inanimate location, or instigator of pain.(83)   a. nala a-rik?                               b. na-táng             na-rik        ba-i

suffix. It is used in a ULOC-UPAT transitive construction (see 6.2.3.7). While the PAT
prefix ha- (3II.PAT) refers to the human undergoer, the LOC prefix refers to the reason of
pain expressed in the preceding complement clause ‘he ate so much meat’.(84)   di mahiting la            faring nee-i        ba      he-ha-rik-i

are given. In (85), the VP contains the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC) that co-indexes the NP
oro nala nuku ‘something over there’ as the U argument. The VP combines with the
NP kaai ‘dog’ in a A-ULOC transitive construction (6.2.2.2).(85)   kaai ya         oro    nala nuku         he-loi              do

argument is di (3A). Both arguments combine with the verb in a A-UPAT transitive
construction (6.2.2.4). Observe that the prefix ha- (3II.PAT) has a human referent. The
PAT prefix can be used only in cases where the acting participant has full control of the
undergoer; otherwise a benefactive serial construction is required as in (90).(87)   he-ura            di ha-loi

234                                                CHAPTER VI
Another example of a A-UPAT transitive construction is given in (88). The verb -loi ‘put
far, chase’ combines with the distributive prefix ta- (DISTR.PAT). The VP has a reciprocal
reading (see also 5.4.2).(88)        pet     kak            ama        mi       ba        ta-loi

contains two pronominal prefixes and in both cases also an aspectual marker. In both
cases, the VP combines with two U arguments. There is no third argument slot. The
evidence for this claim comes from both examples below. The actor participant that
will cause that the flies are chased is cast as the A argument of the verb me ‘come’.4(89)        a. a          me       he-ha-loi=se

above. The verb -loi ‘put far, chase’ is serialized with the verb -l ‘give’ to disambiguate
who is acting upon whom (see also 8.4.2.4). The benefactive serial verb construction
also implicates, that the chasing was not performed with the full control of the
undergoer participant, as in the example below.(90)        kaai di ne-l                   to-ha-loi                      hare na    kof-i

occurs further from the verb stem. The bound stems -baai ‘be angry’ and -l ‘give’ have
the LOC prefix attached immediately to the stem. Both stems are used in UREC-ULOC
transitive construction (6.2.3.5) which indicates that the second person singular
participant expressed with the REC prefix o- (2SG.REC) experiences a strong emotion
with respect of the first person singular participant expressed by the LOC prefix ne-
(1SG.LOC). The verb stem -loi ‘put far, chase’ combines with the verb -l ‘give’ in
benefactive serial construction to express the first person singular undergoer participant
(8.4.2.4).","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"
"  3.4.4.5     Utterance verbs
Utterance verbs refer to different types of communicative acts. They are verbs such as
fanga ‘say’, tanga ‘speak’, ananra ‘tell’, ne ‘call’, tahang ‘ask’, moi ‘sound, answer’.
Utterance verbs typically occur in A-ULOC transitive constructions (see 6.2.2.2). In (67),
the verbs fanga ‘say’ and tahang ‘ask’ are illustrated.(67)   a. na       nala       he-fanga                  b. moku        di ama         he-tahang

constructions as illustrated in 5.5. The second type of utterance verbs expresses the
manner, in which the utterance is performed. These are verbs such as kawai ‘argue’,
tafayak ‘chat, lie’, kalol ‘foretell’. They typically occur in A intransitive construction (see
6.2.4.1), as illustrated in (68).(68)   a. maama         kalol                              b. kalieta       loku kawai

  3.4.4.6    Verbs of perception, cognition and experience
Perception and experience verbs refer to different types of perception, cognitive
processes and describe emotions. A number of such verbs are listed in (69).(69)   faaling           ‘listen’                      maha      ‘perceive, notice, note’       wahai             ‘look’                        -iéng     ‘see’       -muna             ‘love, care’                  -munang   ‘smell, kiss’       pang              ‘feel (emotion), think’       piela     ‘dream’       -minang           ‘remember’                    -yongfa   ‘forget’

The anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD) indicates that an event occurred some time
ago and is know to the addressee. An example is given in (256), where the speaker
refers to a tribal conflict during which a drum was taken from his clan.(256) tafaa foka         la        mi saai                 nu

4 Wim Stokhof and Hein Steinhauer carried out a survey of Alor-Pantar languages published in Stokhof
(1975). Stokhof continued working on Woisika (also referred to as Kamang), and also worked on Abui (1984)
and Kabola (1987). Steinhauer focussed on Blagar (Steinhauer, 1986; 1991).

        1.6       Genetic affiliation
Abui is classified as belonging to the Timor-Alor-Pantar branch of the Trans-New
Guinea (TNG) family (Capell, 1969; Stokhof, 1975; 1984; Pawley, 1998:655; 2001;
Ross, 2005:22-4; Gordon, 2005). The majority of languages spoken in the Alor-Pantar
area belong to same branch of the TNG family. 5 TNG languages extend over the
mountainous area of New Guinea, but also in the northern and southern lowlands; and
as far as the Timor-Alor-Pantar area, where Abui belongs (see Map 1).6 It is unclear
when speakers of TNG languages arrived in the Timor-Alor-Pantar area, but is very
likely that it was before the Austronesians (cf. Klamer et.al., In press).
         In general, most linguists agree that there is a possible connection between the
development of taro and other root crop agriculture in New Guinea 6,000-9,000 years
ago and the initial dispersal of TNG languages (cf. Foley, 1986:275-277; Pawley, 1998:
655; Ross 2005:41-42). Ross (2005:42) argues, that the mountainous east-central region
of New Guinea is probably the place of origin of TNG languages, as the diversity
found there is greatest and may coalesce with the area of taro domestication. As one
proceeds towards the periphery, the diversity decreases. Ross further speculates, that
the extreme of the West TNG linkage in Timor, Alor, and Pantar may represent a
relatively late TNG settlement. However, it is probable that the speakers of TNG
languages reached the area before the Austronesian migration that occurred by mid
third millennium BC.
         Ross (2005:36) groups the Timor-Alor-Pantar languages, and the languages of
Bomberai Peninsula of the Bird’s Head together with the western part of the main
mountain chain into a so called ‘West Trans New Guinea linkage’. He argues that the
group resulted from an earlier dialect chain rather than from a single protolanguage.
         Languages assigned membership in the Trans-New Guinea family (TNG) show
systematic resemblance in the pronominal system and regular sound correspondences
in their basic vocabulary, of which about two hundred etyma have been reconstructed
so far (cf. Pawley, 2005-b). There are alternative groupings of Papuan languages (cf.
Foley, 1986) and some linguists are reserved about the extension of the TNG family.
         As mentioned above, the membership in the TNG family is established by a set
of free pronouns. The reconstructed proto-TNG pronouns (cf. Ross, 2005:29) and
corresponding Abui forms are listed in Table 1.","[28, 29]"

"7.2.6     Heterogeneous complex verbs with functional roots
In Abui, a number of functional roots such as the quantifiers faring ‘much’, kabei
‘little’, or nuk ‘one’ may be incorporated in a CV stem, as illustrated in (61). In all cases,
the functional root combines with the generic root d ‘hold’.(61)    faring-faring-d-          ‘become too much’      nuk-nuk-d-             ‘do one by one’
        RED[much]-hold                                   RED[one]-hold
        kabei-kabei-d-            ‘become very little’
        RED[little]-holdThe use of the CV kabei-kabei-d- is illustrated in (62), where the verb combines with
the A argument di (3A) and the U argument seng ‘money’:(62)    di seng       kabei-kabei-d-i            ba      mi maama he-r-i

        ‘he split and took a bit of money and gave it to the father’               [B07.052.03]The verb naha ‘be not, be lost, NEG’ may serve as the first root in a CV. This is
illustrated in (63), where the CV naha-d- ‘become extinct, cease’ combines with the
pronominal prefix nu- (1PL.E.REC) and is inflected for perfective and durative aspect
with suffixes -i (PFV) and -a (DUR). Note that the verb naha alternates with nai ‘loose,
lost, vanish’ and belongs to the II.f class. It is unclear whether the verb naha is further
derived or not.(63)    ni    nu-naha-d-i-a                      bai       ba,    ri   ko     ri-i

318                                           CHAPTER VII
Another functional root that may be incorporated in a CV is the demonstrative root wó
‘above, DST.H’. In (64), the CV wó-n-r- refers to ‘praising’ of the Lord, lit.: ‘make to be
high, above’. The CV consists of the demonstrative root wó combined with the generic
root n ‘see’ indicating a location ‘be above, high’. A further step in the derivation is the
completive generic root r ‘reach’ that a CV verb referring to a caused event. The CV
stem combines with two arguments, the U argument Lahatala ‘Lord’ is co-indexed with
the prefix ha- (3II.PAT) on the verb.(64)     na     Lahatala ha-wó-n-r-a

7.3      Homogeneous complex verbs
The second type of Abui CVs is referred to as ‘homogeneous’, because roots
combining in a homogeneous CV belong to the generic-verb class. 12 This type of
complex verbs is very flexible and covers sometimes a number of meanings,
determined by the participant constellation. Homogeneous CVs consist of two (or
more) bound generic roots. 13 This is illustrated in (65), where a number of
homogeneous CVs are given derived from the base m ‘be in’.(65)     a. m-a                               b. m-e                        c.    m-i
              be.in-be.at                           be.in-move                    be.in-put
              ‘be in here (near speaker), exist’    ‘come’                        ‘take’The final root determines the valence properties of the stems. In (a), the stem m-a ‘be
in deictic centre, exist’ ends in [-transitive] generic root a ‘be at’ and occurs in
intransitive constructions only. In (b), the stem m-e ‘come’ terminates in the [-
transitive] generic root e ‘move’. The motion verb m-e ‘come’ typically occurs in
intransitive constructions. In (c), the root m ‘be in’ terminates in the [±transitive]
generic root i ‘put’. The resulting CV m-i ‘take, be in’ occurs in both transitive and
intransitive constructions. I conclude that the final root of the homogeneous CVs given
in (65) , determines the valence properties of the stem. This is illustrated in Figure 23:
12 Similar CVs are found in at least two other Papuan languages from the TNG family: Kalam (Pawley, 1987;1991; 1993; 2004; 2005; Pawley and Lane, 1997) and Kobon (Davies, 1984). Both languages have a closed
verb class with about 100 members. Various strategies are employed to describe a large variety of event. As
discussed in 7.2, verbs in these languages may combine with non-verbal roots in complex predicates,
traditionally referred to as ‘adjunct constructions’. In richly documented Kalam, verbs also combine together
to derive more complex verbs that were analysed as SVCs.
13 All generic roots are bound forms, except of the root ì ‘put’ that may occur as an independent predicate inmonoverbal clauses.

intransitive constructions (see 6.2.1). I conclude that the final root is the syntactic head
of the CV. The structure of these verbs is parallel to the heterogeneous CVs discussed
in (8). So far, I have found no evidence that the number of roots combined is a CV is
grammatically restricted in Abui. New stems are derived in a step by step fashion from
the original stems. This is illustrated in (68), where a number of CVs are derived from
the homogenous CV t-a ‘be on’. The arrows indicate the direction of the derivation, as
sometimes only one of the meanings of the CV continues in the further derivation. In
some cases multiple derivational paths are possible. The derivation is cyclic producing
each time a new CV stem.

are discussed in section 7.2.1 and exemplified in (30)-(38), where I gloss the form tak as
‘empty’. The meaning shifts illustrated in (68) may obscure the derivation path. To
avoid confusion and discussion elsewhere in this book, I use the simplified glossing
instead of the full glosses given in this section.
        In this analysis, I take the conservative view that the segments of a verb can
only be analysed as morphemes when there is positive evidence to do so. A
morphologically complex verb that is composed of GVs will only be identified as such
under the strict condition that it occurs in a paradigm with other complex verbs which
shows a minimal contrast in form coupled to a systematic contrast in meaning. This is
why the paradigms discussed below are crucial. There are also many Abui verbs that do
not show systematic form/ meaning contrast with other verbs (see 3.4.4). It may be
that such verbs are morphologically simple forms, but it may also be that some of them
are derived forms whose semantics have shifted so much over time that there is no
evidence of their former morphological composition.
        In 7.3.1, the CVs consisting of two generic roots are discussed. My data covers
the best the homogenous CVs that consists of three generic roots. This substantial
subtype is discussed in section 7.3.2. The CVs that consist of more than three generic
roots are discussed in section 7.3.3.","[340, 341, 342, 343]"

(i) the nature of the generic verbs involved, (ii) the semantic alignment (see chapter 5),
and (iii) the flexibility of Abui verbal constructions (see 6.2.1). The complex verbs are

built from generic verbs, and such verbs already start out with a rather abstract (or
vague) lexical semantic content. Combining with each other to form new verbal
compounds, they become reanalysed as morphemes and lose some of their verbal
semantics (which was already underspecified to begin with). Abstract verbs interacting
with other abstract verbs in a derivation are also bound to undergo semantic drift or
shift, with the result that the compound may become reanalysed as a simplex word over
time. This is something that often happens with compounds. The meaning contribution
of compound structure typically involves a high degree of abstractness and flexibility
(cf. Booij, 2005: 210), because the semantic relation between the elements in the
compound is not formally expressed.
         Despite these complications, however, we have argued that there is evidence to
analyse the final generic verbs in CVs as ‘event classifiers’ that encode information
about the type of event denoted by the verb. Interestingly, their function as final verb
differs from the function they have when they occur as non-heads, i.e. in medial or
initial position. This will be discussed in the next two sections.","[353, 354]"

  6.1.1.8    Phasal aspect markers si (PHSL.I) and ti (PHSL.C)
The phasal aspect marker si (PHSL.I) refers to the point just after the start of an event.
The marker ti (PHSL.C) indicates the point right after an event has finished. Both
markers are formally related to the inceptive markers. In fact, the inceptive and phasal
224                                      CHAPTER VI
markers have reversed functions: inceptive markers refer to the point just before, while
phasal markers refer to the point just after. In (46), both phasal markers are contrasted.(46)   a. di sei=si                                          b. di yaa=ti

            ‘he has just started coming down’ [B02.123.02:06]     ‘he just went’ [B02.086.07:47]The phasal inceptive marker si (PHSL.I) in (46) indicates that the event of ‘coming down’
has just started. The phasal completive marker ti (PHSL.C) indicates that the event of
‘going’ just finished. Note that the marker ti (PHSL.C) does not require the completive
stem of ‘go’ yaar. Another contrastive pair of examples is given in (47).(47)   a. Arjun di he-wahai=si                     Mai Fan do-làk

            ‘Arjun has just finished looking (how) Maifan is leaving’              [B06.008.01]The phasal markers are often used with complement clauses that follow the verb. An
example is given in (48), where the verb piei-l-a ‘dream’ combines with the phasal
marker ti (PHSL.C) and is followed by a complement clause that expresses the content of
the dream. The complement clause contains the affirmative marker ba that indicates
that the reported event really happened (see also 6.4.2.1).(48)   na     piei-l-a=ti                na-noting         Kalang-Fat       yaa    ba

marker ti (PHSL.C) and is followed by a complement clause that expresses the content of
what was said.(49)   a      tah-a               he-fanga=ti                a      ko      me     ba yo

       ‘you were just saying that you would come’                              [B07.010.02]Another use of phasal marker is to introduce a conditional clause in (50)-(51). In (50),
the clause do-mon=ti ‘he died’ introduces a hypothetical condition for the statement
expressed in the clause kang ‘it would be good’.(50)   palaka         hare la          do-mon=ti                  kang

In (51), the first clause ending with the aspectual marker ti (PHSL.C) expresses the
condition of ‘being rich’ followed by the statement in the second clause.(51)    a      kawaisa       ho-mi        mi-a=ti              a   no-ta-wang?

6.1.2       Person inflection and valence
In Abui, the head of a VP may carry person inflection in addition to aspectual inflection
discussed in 6.1.1. Person inflection appears in the form of pronominal prefixes (see
3.3.2). Syntactically, these prefixes are (anaphoric) pronouns that express [+specific]
arguments (see 5.2). Abui verbs appear in a number of transitive and intransitive
constructions. Almost no Abui verb is restricted to a single construction but most verb
stems can be characterized as ‘labile’ (see 6.2.1). Except for the intransitive stative
verbs, most Abui verbs appear with one or two arguments. In my corpus, there are no
instances of ditransitive verbs; in description of events involving three participants
various types of serial verb constructions are used instead (see 8.4.2).
        In this section, I illustrate on a sample of verbs that a verb stem may occur in
transitive, intransitive, and experiencer construction. I discuss the verbs following their
morphological type: (i) free stems that may occur as a VP; (ii) bound stems that
obligatorily carry person inflection (see also 3.4.2.2). Both types are discussed in
sections 6.1.2.1 and 6.1.2.2 respectively.","[245, 246, 247, 248]"

7.3.3     Homogeneous CVs consisting of four and more generic roots
The majority of homogeneous CVs described in this chapter consist of three generic
roots. However, there are paradigms that involve more than three generic roots. In this
section a number of paradigms are given. The CVs that are found in these paradigms
are clearly semantically related and the steps of the derivation can be reconstructed, as
illustrated in (68) is section 7.1.3. In (135), the homogeneous CVs derived from the CV
t-u- ‘leave surface’ are given, with possible lexicalization paths represented by the
arrows.

be attached in front of the stem involved in derivation. There are a number of forms
derived with the verb a ‘be at’ referring to a property or deriving a verb parallel to
applicative verbs in other languages or sometimes even nouns. This part is rather
speculative and more data is needed to confirm these suggestions.(136) ì                 ‘put’                          a-i                 ‘put at, put aside, select’

               5 Argument Realization
In this chapter, I discuss Abui argument realization. Event participants are realized as
different arguments of a verb with NPs and/or pronouns. The choice of the
appropriate realization is determined by the semantic properties of the participant. This
is discussed in section 5.1. The controlling and volitional participants are identified for
the actor (A) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or free pronouns. The affected
participants are identified for the undergoer (U) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or
bound pronouns. The listed criteria apply to arguments in both transitive and
intransitive constructions.
        The choice between a pronoun and an NP is determined by the referential
properties of the participant. In section 5.2, I show that arguments with a specific
reference are expressed with pronouns and optional NPs; arguments with a non-
specific reference are expressed with NPs. In section 5.3, I discuss the A arguments
that are expressed with free pronouns. In section 5.4, the U arguments expressed with
bound pronouns are described. There are three distinct sets of bound pronouns that
may express the U arguments. As discussed in section 5.5, the choice of a bound
pronoun is determined by the semantic properties of the participants such as
[±individuated] and [±change of state]. In section 5.6, I focus on the U argument in
transitive constructions. I illustrate multiple ways in which the U argument can be
expressed. In section 5.7, the argument realization in intransitive constructions is

"   7.3.2.1     Semantic contribution of the final root
As discussed in sections 7.1.3 and 7.3.2, the final root of a homogeneous CV is the
syntactic head. An additional function of the final root is that is describes the different
types of events, in similar way as the final generic root in heterogeneous CVs discussed
in 7.2. As the set of the generic roots is limited, the generic roots may be analyzed as
‘event classifiers’. Not all of the generic verbs are equally productive as event classifiers.
324                                         CHAPTER VII
For example, in the tripartite derivations, the verbs h, k, l/r, ng/n, p, t, and i frequently
occur as final root, while l/r, d, ng and i are typically used as final root in larger
derivations or in heterogeneous verbs, and f and b have an overall low frequency. The
verb u is used most often in non-final position, in final position it is ambiguous with
the perfect suffix -u (PFV). The verbs s and m are typically used as initial verbs and
occur rarely as final roots.
          In (74), I demonstrated that the generic root k ‘bring’ can derive other CV stem
from the CV t-a ‘be on, lie’. In (77), the full set of CVs derived from the CV t-a ‘be on,
lie’ is repeated:(77)   t-a-i              ‘put on’                       t-a-h-        ‘already put on’

       lie-be.at-give                                    lie-be.at-seeNote that the derived CVs in (77) cover a wide range of meanings. Some of these
meanings will be exemplified in (78)-(86). In (78), the use of the CV t-a-i is illustrated.
In (a), t-a-i is interpreted as ‘to put x down’, in (b), it refers to curing a person by
‘putting on’ medicine, while in (c), it is used to express an order as something (a duty)
that the old woman ‘imposes on’ the child.(78)   a. na       yambuk             mi    tai                 nat-i-a

down’ has been completed. Elsewhere in this book I gloss the stem t-a-h- as
‘put.on.CPL’. In (79), the verb t-a-h- is exemplified. In (a) t-a-h- is interpreted as
‘already put x down’. In (b), it is interpreted as ‘x being put down on y’ where the y
argument is expressed with the noun pelang ‘canoe’ The x argument is understood as
the second person.(79)   a. ri    ri-mai                sak      he-tel             t-a-h-i

causes the participant(s) to ‘lie down’. Depending on the context in which the verb is
used, it may get various interpretations, including ‘to shoot x’, ‘to cover x’ or ‘to empty
x’. In (80), the CV t-a-k is used to refer to the ‘bringing down’ of birds and has here the
reading of ‘shooting’. The CV combines with two arguments. The A argument is
realized with the NP Arjun. The U argument is expressed with the NP kuya ‘bird’ co-
indexed as patient with the prefix ha- (3II.PAT)(80)   Arjun de-kartipel         ong     ba      mara              kuya ha-t-a-k

       ‘Arjun made himself a catapult to go up and shoot the birds’ [B06.014.03]Interestingly, when the event of ‘shooting’ was completed, the final root k ‘bring’
alternates with the root p ‘touch’ as illustrated in (81).(81)   mangmat do de-kuya              ha-t-a-p-i                       yaa ba       sei

       ‘her foster child was shooting birds along the way coming down there’ [B02.104.20:08]The final verb is not alternated for the other meanings of the CV t-a-k. In (82), the CV
t-a-k refers to ‘covering’ of one’s head with a piece of cloth, thus being a possible
interpretation of ‘to bring x to lie on y’ where the x argument is expressed as the U
argument of the verb mi ‘take’.(82)   ama        do   di kabala do            mi         de-fui        he-t-a-k-i

       ‘and the people covered the top of their heads with a cloth’     [B02.169.08:43]Another use of the CV t-a-k is given in (83). The verb refers to ‘stopping’ of the
speaker to prevent him to step on a snake. The interpretation ‘to bring y to lie’ is
translated as ‘stop, prevent, interrupt’.(83)   ne-feela        di ne-t-a-k                          mading      hu    mon do

       ‘my friend prevented me from being bitten by a snake’                           [B07.012.02]The final GV l ‘give’ encodes an event that is externally caused and involves a transfer
of participants. In the derivation t-a-l this renders the interpretation of ‘to drop x on y’.
This is illustrated in (84)-(85). In (84), the verb t-a-l refers to sewing of tobacco.

verbs ending in ng seem parallel to applicative verbs in other languages. In (86), the CV
t-a-ng is illustrated. In (a) the verb combines with the noun kaai ‘dogs’ that are released
to hunt, while in (b) the benefactive of releasing is expressed with the LOC prefix ne-
(1SG.LOC)combines with two arguments. The bow that is to be released is the U
argument of the verb mi ‘take’.(86)   a. neng           loku ba, he-n-u                             kaai ha-tang                      kang

involvement of the actor. For example, t-a-ng can contrast with t-a-l ‘to drop x on y’
(discussed above) when it is interpreted as ‘to allow x to drop on y’, for example, ‘to
allow water to drop on the floor’.
        Some more examples of CVs with final generic roots k ‘bring’, i ‘put’, l ‘give’, ng
‘see’ are given in (87) where the verbs are listed in four columns according to the final
generic root.","[346, 347, 348, 349]"
"  8.4.7.1   SVC with kul ‘must’
The verb kul ‘must’ is used to express deontic modality. An example is given in (203)
where kul combines with a single A argument:(203) Floris di kul Petumbang               yaa-r-i
      name 3A must place                    go-COMPL-PFV
      ‘Floris had to go to Petumbang’                                     [B10.053.05]The verb kul ‘must’ may occur in different syntactic positions as illustrated in (204)
with a distinct reading. In (a) the modal follows the pronoun forming a contiguous SVC
with sakoladi ‘learn’ and encoding deontic modality. However, in (b) the NP is
extracted in pragmatic position and the A marking free pronoun di (3A) intervenes
between kul and sakoladi ‘learn’. This non-contiguous SVC encodes epistemic
modality:(204) a. moku fil-a             di kul sakola-d-i=se
         kid       be.young 3A must school-hold-PFV=INCP.I

       b. moku       fila        kul    di sakola-d-i=se

           ‘the small child is certainly about to learn’                  [B10.053.08]In instances such as (b) kul may be considered to be an adverb. Note that adverbs are
mainly found preceding the A argument in the left edge of a clause or in the clause-
initial pragmatic position. In some cases they are preceded by focussed argument.
Another instance of kul ‘must’ displaying adverbial features is given in (205). Here kul
indicates epistemic modality; the dog is reported to be ‘certainly’ lost:(205) he-kaai        kul kupai tama=ng             nai-d-i

logical necessity by the speaker in the following example where kul combines with du
that is here used to express that food has to ‘accompany’ or simply ‘be there’:(206) nala     ma do         kul ha-d-u

   8.4.7.2   SVC with kang ‘be good’
The verb kang ‘be good’ indicates that an event ‘really’ happened. An example is given
in (207) where kang is serialized with wel ‘pour’.(207) di      kang            da-wel

happened. Constructions with kang occurred frequently in elicitations of the Man Tree
game. 23 In the following example taken from a narrative the water bucket is being
reported as truly getting empty:(208) ya       do     di kang          taka-d-i                        do

third person arguments expressed obligatorily with the free pronoun di (3A) and an
optional NP. This serial construction is a source of the adverb dikang ‘again’, an
instance of its use is given in (209). I analyze the form dikang as an adverb ‘again’,
because the A argument is expressed with second person singular free pronoun a (2SG).
More details can be found in section 6.3.(209) kopi    a      dikang              ma-r=te

   8.4.7.3     SVC with ra/re ‘reach’
The verb ra/re ‘reach’ occurs in serial construction to express speaker’s intention to
perform some activity. Abui verb ‘reach’ has two alternating stems: the inceptive stem
re ‘reach, try’ refers to reaching or trying that has an initial point. This verb is also used
in aspectual SVC illustrated in 8.3.1.3. The continuative stem ra ‘reach, attempt’ is used
when the event of trying has not clear initial and final point, it has a reading of ‘reach’
or ‘attempt, persist’. The minor verb ra/re ‘reach’ usually occurs in A≡UPAT
experiencer construction (6.2.5.2), expressing a single participant with both free and
bound pronoun. Consider now (210):
23 Man-Tree game is a MPI elicitation tool designed to provide stimuli and help elicit spatial reference andnavigation apparatus of a language. Language consultants are presented each an identical set of photographs.
One of the consultants is to describe the photographs that consequently have to be correctly identified by the

         ‘he tries to leave (obligation)’          ‘he tries to leave (deliberately)’ [B05.045.01]The single participant is realized as an experiencer as free and bound pronoun with
single reference in (a). In (b) it is expressed only as a free pronoun. The minor verb ra
‘reach, attempt’ expresses speaker’s intention to ‘leave’. The use of the inceptive re
‘reach, try’ is illustrated in (211) where it combines with the verb natet-d-i ‘stand up,
get standing’:(211) a-re                 natet-d-i!
      2SG.PAT-reach.ICP    stand.up.CPL-hold-PFV

persistent way. The single (human) participant is realized as the U argument with the
PAT prefix. Because the speaker mostly expresses his ‘wish’ to perform an activity, the
free pronoun is omitted and the A≡UPAT experiencer construction is alternated, as
illustrated in (212). In both cases the major verb is inflected with perfective suffix -i
(PFV) although the expressed situation must be considered as an instance of irrealis
mode (cf. Payne 1997:244):(212) a. na-ra                we-i    b.        a-ra                    na-pun-i

‘still’ and has many similarities with an adverbial modifier. In (a), the item still can be
interpreted as a verb; however, in (b), the predicate dara does not show person
agreement with the A argument na (1SG). The form functions as an adverbial modifier
(see 6.3).(213) a. di da-ra              nala nee         naha

considering the restrictions on the use of the active pronouns with inanimates, it is
likely that the form dara in (214) is adverbial. It is quite obvious that the semantics of
the verb ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ can be easily extended to an adverbial use.

      ‘the thorn is still actually stuck in my foot’                            [B10.020.03]The verb ra ‘reach’ is sometimes used to refer to an event performed simultaneously by
more than one participant. In that case it combines with the distributive prefix ta-
(DISTR.PAT) that refers to the performing participants. The function of ra in such
instances is complex. It serves to introduce a multiple actor and indicates the realis
mode. Consider now the example (215):(215) Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata la            ta-ra                    de-kaai     bol

      ‘Fan Malei and Fan Ata each beat their dog there’                         [B07.076.02]In (215) ra combines with bol ‘hit’ sharing the multiple actor expressed with two proper
nouns Fan Malei and Fan Ata. These two participants are expressed as the U
argument of ra and also cross-referenced as the possessor of dekaai ‘their own dog’.
The SVC contains further the deictic verb la ‘be.MD’ indicating a ‘distant’ location of
the event. In some cases the whole minor verb might be reduplicated to indicate that
the participants perform the event simultaneously, but each of them on his own. This is
illustrated in (216) where ra combines with mok ‘bring together, pray’:(216) ta-ra-ta-ra                     mok
      RED[DISTR.PAT-reach.CNT]        bring.together
      ‘each prays on his own’                                                   [B04.019.03]Now compare the construction discussed in (215) with the construction given in (217).
Here the boys Fan Malei and Fan Ata beat simultaneously each his own dog. That
means that more than one dog is being beaten, while in (215) their single dog was
maltreated:(217) Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata ta-ra-ta-ra                       de-kaai bol
      name         SEQ name           RED[DISTR.PAT-reach.CNT] 3I.AL-dog hit
      ‘Fan Malei with Fan Ata beat each his dog on his own (different place, way)’ [B07.076.02]Also in this case the reduplication of the minor verb ra indicates that the participants
act simultaneously but each of them upon another undergoer.
                       Appendix: Abui texts
In this section I present a number of Abui texts. The first text is an ancestor story of
the Aila clan la teitu nikalieta. The second and third text are two fables about the
monkey and the turtle titled luka-luka ya yoikoi. The fourth text is the Abui version of
the Lord’s Prayer. The sixth text moku mayol is a description of a traditional bride
price negotiations and marriage. In the transcriptions I use the comma symbol to mark
a pause in intonation, longer pauses (where the speaker is thinking) are marked with the
plus symbol +, long pauses that mark the end of a discourse unit are marked with the
number sign #. Malay loans are given in bold case.                    la teitu nikalieta (ancestor story of Aila clan)
This story describes the ancestry and origin of the Aila clan that is a part of the
Takalelang village. The common ancestor of Aila clan is claimed to originate from the
Munaseli area of the neighbouring island Pantar. After an internal conflict some of the
ancestors left Munaseli and came up to Likwatang area.1 Having cultivated some areas
they came in contact with the original (Non-Austronesian) Abui speaking population
settled in Kewai above in the mountains. The mountain people did not have iron tools
and therefore they allowed the Aila people to stay and demanded iron tools from
them.2 After a conflict the Aila ancestors had to escape; one of the two brothers was
killed, while the other one managed to escape and built a village. Although he was
paying a tribute to the Kewai, his village was attacked and burnt down. Only a couple
managed to escape. The woman was pregnant; she gave birth to a child and was taken
back by her family. The Aila clan members count their origin from her. In the recent
past they were summoned by the government and the church to come down from their
village on the mountain top and move to the new settlement Kameng Taha. The
relocation of the village happened during the lifetime of the old story-teller Alfred
Maufani. His ironic allusions describe the relocation as a well-meant intention of the
government and the church to let everybody dwell in peace together. The style of the
story is rich with frequent parallelisms and direct speech, and frequent resuming of the
previous (tail head linkage). The number of Malay loans is very limited.","[437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442]"

7.3.1     Homogeneous complex verbs consisting of two generic roots
The set of homogenous CVs that consist of two generic roots is relatively small. As
discussed in section 7.1.1, CVs must obey phonotactic rules. As homogenous CVs
consist only of two segments (a consonant and a vowel root) they must match the
structure of Abui open or closed syllable. This is illustrated in (69)-(71). Note that all
stems, except two last, match the light syllable structure. The stems i-t ‘lie down’ and u-
k ‘draw off, bring away’, a-k ‘open, open mouth’, and e-k ‘summon, invite’ are closed
syllables.

valence. All homogenous CVs given in (69) and (70) end in a [-transitive] generic root.
These stems occur in intransitive constructions. The CVs given in (71) end in a
[±transitive] generic root and consequently occur in both transitive and intransitive
constructions.
        An example of the use of the CV p-a ‘touch’ is given in (72). The CV p-a
combines with a single argument expressed with the pronominal prefix no- (1SG.REC).
Note that the CV no-p-a ‘be attached to me’ it incorporated in a complex relative
clause that modifies the noun bataa ‘wood’.(72)   {no-p-a                       mi-a}RC     ba    [bataa do]NP          ha-fik-i

7.3.2     Homogeneous complex verbs consisting of three generic roots
There is a large set of homogeneous CVs that consist of three roots. As the CVs are
subject to the phonotactic restrictions, most frequently occurring phonological shape is
the closed syllable. As discussed in section 7.1.1, Abui closed syllables allow a single
consonant in the coda. This implies that only the consonant roots will be found in the
head position of the CVs that consist of three roots. It implies as well that the derived
CVs will be [±transitive] and occur in both transitive and intransitive constructions.
This is schematically represented in Figure 24.","[343, 344, 345]"

  3.4.4.7     Verbs of bodily processes and activities
Bodily process verbs refer to processes that occur or involve bodies of animate
participants. The verbs of bodily processes and activities are a heterogeneous group
with respect to constructions, in which they may occur. The verbs listed in (72) typically
occur in A U transitive constructions.

The members
of the first subgroup do not contain the final generic root a ‘be at’. The members of the
second subgroup end in the vowel /ɑ/. They are morphologically complex, consisting
of two bound roots. Roots expressing states or properties are bound. Unlike adjectives,
they may only be used as adnominal modifier with the generic root a ‘be at’. As
illustrated in (80), the bound roots fok- ‘big’ and lil- ‘hot’ obligatorily combine with
another bound root, belonging to the generic verb class.(80)   fok-a           ‘be big’                              lil-a                    ‘be hot’
       big-be.at                                             hot-be.atSemantically, the set of stative verbs that obligatorily contains the generic verb a ‘be at’
refers to properties such as size (big, small), colour (red, blue/green, bright), position
(near, far, high, deep), material density (fine-grained, soft), material condition
(hot/cold). However, the verbal roots given in (80) that combine with a ‘be at’ to refer
to states may also combine with other generic roots, such as d ‘hold’, or r ‘reach’ derive
other types of verbs as illustrated in (81), for more details see 7.2.1.(81)   fok-d-i         ‘get big, grow up, increase’          lil-r-i                  ‘heat up’

verbs are found as heads in VPs and as adnominal modifiers in NPs. Stative verbs
overlap in their adnominal modifier function with adjectives (see 3.5.1). In (82), the use
of the stative verbs lila ‘be hot’ and fing ‘be eldest’ is contrasted. In (a), it is used in a
noun phrase. In (b), the verb lila ‘be hot’ is the head of a VP combining with an
argument realized with the NP ya do ‘this water’. In (c), lila ‘be hot’ combines with a U
argument, expressed with the prefix from set II no- (1SG.REC). Analogically, in (d) the
verb fing ‘be eldest’ serves as the adnominal modifier in the NP headed by moku ‘kid’.

2.5.5    Stress and vowel quality
The length, pitch and intensity of vowels change under stress. In fast speech, also the
quality of the stressed vowels is affected. As illustrated in (97), the mid front vowel /ɛ/
followed by the velars [k, ŋ] is lowered, slightly lengthened, and pronounced as the
diphthong [ɛɑ] when under stress. The ‘breaking’ of /ɛ/ does not occur in slow and
careful speech.

2.5.6    Affixes
Affixes and clitics in Abui are light syllables that do not attract stress. Pronominal
prefixes fit the iambic pattern of the word as illustrated in the following examples:(99)    /CV|CV(C)/
        /hɛ’fu/              he-fu                ‘his betel nut’

       /ʔɛ’kaːlɑ/           e-kaala                 ‘your pudding (sweet pudding from corn)’
                            2SG.AL-puddingAspectual markers are light syllables (or single vowels) that form a prosodic word with
the verb. As illustrated in (100), the verbs tukon ‘cut’ and marang ‘come up’ consist of
two light syllables stressed in iambic pattern. When these verbs are inflected for aspect
the stress moves to the final syllable and is placed on the clitic.","[83, 84, 85, 86]"

in (220). The particle doma ‘no’ is located in front of the negative clause muila naha
‘not play’.",[302]
"8.2        Symmetrical serial verb constructions
The verbs in symmetrical SVCs (SSVC) belong to unrestricted sets (as already discussed
in 8.1.2). They do not show any dependency in respect of each other. In general, the
linear ordering of the verbs in a SSVC is the same as order of sub-events building up the
reported event. However, the choice of the verbs reporting various sub-events is
conventionalised as an event has to be reported in a culturally and conventionally
accepted way (cf. Bruce, 1988; Pawley, 1991).4
        The SSVC is sometimes indicated by the presence of an aspectual marker
between two verbs. In (13) the verb ban ‘carry’ combines with the aspectual marker te
(INCP.C) that is not shared with the verb sei ‘come down’. Both verbs form a SSCV
characterized by its intonational properties.(13)    ban=te                sei!
        carry.CPL=INCP.C      come.down.CNT
        ‘bring it down!’                                                            [B02.060.24:01]The borders of a SSVC may be fuzzy, which makes it difficult to determine whether a
SVC is symmetrical, asymmetrical, or hybrid. In (14) the verb me ‘come’ may be
interpreted to be part of two SVCs. It either indicates the direction in which the
4 This type of SVCs is found in other Papuan languages consisting sometimes of more than five verbs in
languages such as Kalam (Pawley, 1987; 1991; 1993; 2004) or Kobon (Davies, 1984).

SVCs (see 8.2.1), locative SVCs (see 8.2.2), and synonymous SVCs (see 8.2.3).","[376, 377]"
"        1.10 Outline of the grammar and the presentation of data
This book is organized as follows. In chapter 2, I give a description of the Abui
phonological system. Morphology and grammatical categories are given in chapter 3. In
chapter 4, nouns and noun phrases are described. Chapter 5 discusses argument
realization. Verb phrases and clauses are described in chapter 6. The final two chapters
focus on multi-verb constructions. In chapter 7, I describe complex verbs; chapter 8
gives an overview of serial verb constructions. In the appendixes, a number of texts are
given as well as Abui-English and English-Abui wordlists.
        Abui language data are presented in the following fashion, as illustrated in (22).

        In chapter 7, I discuss the morphology of Abui complex verbs. The verb stems
are split into segments that are glossed as generic verbs. These glosses are given only in
chapter 7. Elsewhere, I adopt simplified glossing as illustrated in the left-hand column.","[46, 47]"

7.1.3     Compositional and semantic properties of CVs
Abui CVs consist of two or more morphemes; these morphemes are free or bound
roots that build up a complex stem. The set of roots found in the initial position of the
stem is not restricted. The set of roots found in second position is restricted. In vast
majority, the second (and following roots) belongs to generic-verb class. Before I
elaborate on the compositional and semantic properties of Abui CVs, first I give a brief
overview of Abui generic roots.
        In the Table 24, the inventory of Abui generic-verb class is given (cf. 3.4.5.2). It
comprises eighteen mono-segmental roots. The phonological form is given in the left-
hand column, the orthographic representation in the second column, and the used gloss
in the third column and the possible interpretations in the right-hand column.

The generic roots are divided in two subgroups according to their valence properties.
Those given in the above part of the table may be used in both transitive and
intransitive construction. With respect to their phonological shape, these generic roots
are characterized as consonants or high vowels. In the lower part of the table, the low-
vowel roots are given. These roots are always intransitive. Further, the roots that are
phonologically characterized as alveodental liquids (l, r), non-labial nasals (n, ng), and
unvoiced alveodental obstruents (t, s) are analyzed as alternating roots. Their
alternation reflects the internal temporal structure of the referred event (Aktionsart).
They refer to the same event that is viewed either as having an endpoint (completive),
or an initial point (inceptive).
        Having discussed the inventory of Abui generic-verb class, now I turn back to
the complex verbs. In this description, I distinguish between two major types of CVs:
(i) HETEROGENEOUS COMPLEX VERBS, in which the conjoined roots belong to different
classes (of which at least the final root belongs to the generic-verb class), and (ii)
HOMOGENOUS COMPLEX VERBS, composed of two or more generic roots. This distinction

is illustrated in (6) and (67). Heterogeneous CVs are explored in detail in section 7.2,
homogeneous CVs in section 7.3. In what follows, I will identify the morphological
structure of CVs. I use the distinction between free and bound forms and alternation in
aspectual marking to identify the head of a CV.
         Consider now example (6), where a number of CVs derived from the bound
root bek ‘bad’ are given:(6)      a. bek-a           b. bek-d-a                     c.    bek-d-i             d. bek-a-d-i

CV stems.4 The verbs derived from the root bek ‘bad’ are exemplified in (7).(7)      a. di de-toku            beka       he-daweng           buuk-e

occur in intransitive constructions (see 6.2.4.2). In (b-e), the [±transitive] generic root d
‘hold, get’ is the final root of a CV. It derives verbs that refer to internally caused
change of state or condition that may occur in both transitive and intransitive
construction. The final root of a CV determines the valence and semantic properties of
the CV stem (aspectual suffixes are not counted). It is the syntactic ‘head’ of a
heterogeneous CV. It is in line with the head-final character of Abui morpho-syntax,
where objects precede verbs and negations and conjunctions occur at the end of a
4 Note that the morpheme a is polysemous, it is treated differently in (a) and (b). In (a), it derives the stative
verb beka ‘be bad’ from the bound root bek ‘bad’. Because it derives a new verb, it is treated as a generic root
‘be at’. In (b), it expresses durative aspect (-DUR). It is the generic root d ‘hold’ that derives the new CV ‘get
bad, break down’ and requires aspectual inflection. In (c), it alternates with the aspectual suffix -i (PFV). Both
meanings expressed by the form a are probably historically related (for more details about aspectual
inflection, see 6.1.1).

clause, GVs that derive denominal verbs also occur in final position. As discussed in
4.3, nominal compounds also are right-headed.
        Consider now example (8). The free root al/ar ‘burn’ combines with one (or
more) generic roots in CVs. Only the CV stem ar-a ‘be in fire’ is intransitive. The other
CV stems are [±transitive], as their final roots l ‘give’, ng ‘see’, d ‘hold’ and i ‘put’ are
[±transitive]. As discussed in 6.2.4.2, many stative verbs are derived with the generic
verb a ‘be at’. They typically occur in intransitive constructions. The [-transitive] generic
root a ‘be at’ that precedes those roots does restrict the valence of the stems in the
same way as it does when it is the final root such as in ar-a ‘be in fire’.(8)      ar                 ‘burn’                                ar-a          ‘be in fire, fire n.’

determines the valence as schematically illustrated in Figure 22:                    VP                                                   V[±transitive]                           V[-transitive]                      V[-transitive]

generic roots deriving new CVs do not occur each with the same frequency. The most
frequently used generic root is d ‘hold, get’. This root is also the default generic root
that may combine with loan roots. The other frequently occurring roots are a ‘be at’, l
‘give’, r ‘reach’, ng ‘see’, t ‘lie’, and i ‘put’.5 The remaining roots do not occur frequently
and are not productive in derivation of new verbs and seem almost exclusively
restricted to the homogenous CVs.","[318, 319, 320, 321]"

are established criteria how to categorize the Aktionsart. The tests use the temporal
modification and quantification of the arguments (Krifka, 1998; Vendler, 1967; Verkuyl,
336                                              CHAPTER VII
1972).15 In this discussion I use the features ADD TO and BOUNDED to characterize the
Aktionsart. The combinations of the features with examples of verbs are shown below:(113) a. [−BOUNDED][−ADD TO]:                    be, sleep, know, mark, be red         b. [+BOUNDED][−ADD TO]:                 drop, hit, sleep an hour, know the number         c. [−BOUNDED][+ADD TO]:                 slide down, fall, aim, pull         d. [+BOUNDED][+ADD TO]:                 fall at, slid down, lose the key, pull out a canoeIn sum, the vocalic generic verbs in medial position are analyzed as overt encoders of
the inner aspect (Aktionsart) of an event. This may seem strange because cross-
linguistically, although stem alternation encoding telic properties of verbs is found
elsewhere in Papuan languages, or in Slavic languages. In English, Aktionsart
distinctions are typically part of the lexical semantics of a word and are not expressed
by derivational morphology. Abui is exceptional in that it has a (limited) set of complex
verbs which express Aktionsart systematically and overtly in their derivational
morphology.","[358, 359]"

3.2.2        Categorial indeterminacy
There are a number of ambiguous lexical items that are identified as nouns or verbs.
The ambiguity is resolved by the syntactic context in which the items occur. Consider
the form luuk in (8).(8)     a. he-luuk              do         he-feela      afenga     wi-d-a

           ‘while people were dancing, the two were eating their betel nut’    [B02.087.08:17]The lexical item luuk in (8) is identified a noun in (a) because it combines with the
possessive prefix and serves as an argument of the verb wida ‘become like that,
resemble’. In (b), the form is identified as a verb because it combines with a single
argument expressed with the noun ama ‘person’. In both cases the form luuk is
followed by the anaphoric demonstrative do that marks the end of a domain. In (a), do
(PRX) marks the end of an NP. In (b), it has a nominalising function, it marks the end of
a clause that serves as background information for the second clause.
        Another ambiguous item is tur, illustrated in (9). Both examples are taken from
a narrative. In (a), the form tur refers to a ‘spoon’ that fell out from the house and
must be picked up again. In (b), the form tur is used as a predicate ‘scoop up’ and
combines with the U argument is fat ma ‘cooked corn’.(9)    a. ah, na        sei               tur       mi=se         yo!

same form yaa is used in (b), where it refers to the activity of ‘going’.(10)   a. na      yaa     foka=ng      ha-fui-d-a

relation between their two meanings in the sense that the noun refers to a U argument
of the verb in a very broad sense. The semantic relations may be described in pairs such
as undergoer/result-activity, instrument-activity, location-activity, and entity-property

an NP) or predicatively (as the head of a VP). The same categorial ambiguity is found
also by lexical items that are borrowed from Malay, as illustrated in (15). The two uses
of sakola display the location-activity relationship; tulusa displays the undergoer-
activity relationship:

the syntactic and morphological context, in which they occur. The presented data
suggests that Abui sides with Austronesian languages in categorial indeterminacy and
not with Papuan (cf. Foley, 1998:509, 512; Himmelmann, 2005:126-131), which
normally have a strict division in nominal and verbal categories.1
3.2.3      Distributional properties
At the word level, nouns are characterized as either free or bound roots that may
combine with pronominal prefixes (for an overview of pronominal inventory, see
section 3.3). Pronominal prefixes serve to express possessors (for a detailed discussion
of possession, see section 4.2). Nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor
marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or
gender are not found in Abui.2
        Two free roots combined with pronominal prefixes are given in (16). The
pronominal prefixes belong to set I, glossed as AL(inenable) below. The free root feela
‘friend’ combines with pronominal prefix ne- (1SG.AL). The free root maama ‘father’
combines with pronominal prefix he- (3II.AL):(16)     ne-feela                ‘my friend’                         he-maama           ‘his father’
         1SG.AL-friend                                               3II.AL-fatherBound roots combine with pronominal prefixes from set III, glossed as INAL(ienable)
below. As illustrated in (17), the bound roots –táng ‘hand’ and wei ‘ear’ combine with
pronominal prefixes na- (1SG.INAL) and ha- (3II.INAL) respectively.(17)     na-táng                 ‘my hand’                           ha-wei             ‘his ear’
         1SG.INAL-hand                                               3II.INAL-earThere is a distinction between the nouns in (16) and (17). The nouns in (17) obligatorily
combine with the pronominal prefixes that express a possessor (see section 4.2.2). The
nouns in (16) combine optionally with pronominal prefixes (see section 4.2.3).
       Nouns never combine with pronominal prefixes from set II, glossed as
REC(ipient) below, which may only be attached to verbs. In (18), this restriction1 Categorical indeterminacy is a typical feature of Austronesian languages. As discussed by (Foley, 1998)Austronesian morphology is typified by the roots that ‘exhibit categorical indeterminacy, i.e. a given root can
be used nominally or verbally without derivation by being head of syntactically nominal or verbal
construction’ (Foley, 1998:509). However, ‘the roots in Papuan languages show a sharp division into nominal
and verbal categories and can only change via morphological derivation’ (Foley, 1998:512). Another Papuan
language that shows similar categorical indeterminacy is Sulka. This language has been in long-termed contact
with Austronesian languages (Reesink, 2005:145) which resulted in sharing the typological feature of
indeterminacy with AN languages (Reesink, 2005:163).
2 The lack of case and number inflection of nouns is claimed to be a common feature among other Papuanlanguages (Foley, 1986:93-96) as they rather employ verbal affixation to signal case relations.

Alfred Maufani tells how the marriage of his daughter was arranged. First, the betel nut
is sent to the parents of the girl. After they all agree, bride price negotiations are
arranged. Nowadays the young pair already knows each other, but sometimes the
marriage is arranged by the older people, sometimes a special person in the village.
There can be also special motivation, because, the one who manages to organize a
wedding will get a part of the bride price, this is a topic of the bride price discussion.
After the wedding the young woman leaves to the house of her husband. Sons, on the
other hand, stay with their parents.

their internal temporal structure (inner aspect, Aktionsart). I distinguish three stem
types: continuative (CNT), completive (CPL), and inceptive (ICP). For more details about
the aspectual properties of stem types, see 6.1.1.1, where the various types are
exemplified.
        As illustrated in (41), for the first type, the coda of the stem is alternated. In all
cases the alternation contrasts the completive (CPL) stem and non-completive
continuative (CNT) or inceptive (ICP) stem. In (42) a number of verbs are given that
alternate the final consonant of the stem.
distinct aspectual properties (Foley 1986:146-8). In Telefol some verb stems obligatorily combine with
aspectual suffixes while other do not. In Kiwai, continuative stems must end in non-low vowels e, i, o, u. The
punctiliar stems terminate in low vowel a or in diphthong ai (Foley 1986:147). In Marind (Drabbe 1955)
alternations of the ‘momentary’ and ‘durative’ stems are found. The durative stems end in /ɑ/ and the
momentary stems in a consonant.

contains other verbs such as bok ‘dig, poke, perforate, push in/inform’, pok ‘split’, buk
‘brace’, wak ‘embrace’, wok ‘throw’, muk ‘blow’, eik ‘defecate’, batek ‘strike’, wik ‘carry
away’, piek ‘pass along’, lek ‘move towards’, kek ‘prod’, tik ‘stretch’, akuk ‘not see (close
one’s eyes)’. Other verbs such as mok ‘put together’ illustrated in (b) alternate final
/k/~/p/. These include tak ‘bring down’, uk ‘withdraw’, tok ‘put’, talok ‘lean’, tuk
‘reach’. A large group of verbs alternate /ŋ/~/n/ such as lang ‘wash’ in (c). These
include tukong ‘cut’, tàng ‘release’, mong ‘die’, pung ‘grab’, feng ‘injure, kill’, paneng
‘make’, bang ‘carry on shoulder’, meng ‘wear’, marang ‘come up’, iéng ‘see’, mang
‘bear, possess’, pang ‘feel’, rang ‘be turned towards’, reng ‘turn towards’, ong ‘make’,
akung ‘be dark’. Many verbs alternate /l/~/r/ such as bel ‘pull’ in (d). They include
verbs as kul ‘throw’, tul ‘scoop’, nal ‘make like this’, nil ‘already like this’, mal ‘prepare
food’, kol ‘bind, trick’, -uol ‘strike’. These alternations correlate with the alternation of
the generic verbs l ‘give’ and r ‘reach’. None of these alternations is really productive in
the sense that loan items are not affected by it. In (43), the remaining verb stems
belonging to the first type are given. For the stem yaa ‘go’ the final consonant /r/ is
added. For the bound stem nate ‘stand up’ the consonant /t/ is attached to the stem.
For the stems takai ‘steal’ and koi ‘cut down’ the final /j/ is alternated with /f/, while
for the stem baai the final /j/ alternates with /b/.(43)   a. yaa          ~        yaar              (type II.e)

match the regular pattern of aspectual inflection with aspectual suffixes (see section
3.5.4, and 6.1.1). Two analyses are possible:(44)   a. fanga       ~          fangi          (type III.a)

       b. fang-a       ~         fang-i
           say-DUR               say-PFVIn (44), the verb stem can be either analysed as alternating or as having a stem that
obligatorily combines with an aspectual suffix. This alternation is quite productive and
it is found with many other verbs such as tanga ‘speak’, ananra ‘tell’, aisa ‘urinate’,
muila ‘play’, yengra ‘be how many’, falakda ‘get bright’, kanra ‘finish’, arida ‘appear’,
kawaisa ‘be rich’, tihaida ‘get heavy’, naida ‘get lost’. In my analysis the alternating
stems such as tanga ‘speak’, fanga ‘say’, ananra ‘tell’, aisa ‘urinate’ are analysed as
alternating according to type (a) in (44). They alternate the continuative (CNT) and
completive (CPL) verb stem. There are no free stems such as *fang ‘say’ or *tang
‘speak’. However, instances of complex verb stems such as ari-d-a ‘become appearing’
are analyzed differently. This is illustrated in (45), where the complex stem ari-d-a
consists of the root ari ‘appear’ and the bound root d ‘hold’ combined with the
obligatory durative suffix -a (DUR) that alternates with the perfective suffix -i (PFV). For
more details about this property of complex verb stems see section 7.1.3.(45)   ari-d-a               ~       ari-d-i              (type III.a)
       appear-hold-DUR               appear-hold-PFV
       ‘become appearing’            ‘became appearing’The remaining alternations of the second type are limited to a relatively small number
of frequently occurring verbs. Verb stems given in (46) share only the onset consonant.
They alternate the continuative (CNT) or inceptive (ICP) verb stem with the completive
(CPL) stem.

As illustrated in examples above, neither a simple phonotactic rule nor a number of
suffixes can predict the shape of the alternating stems. However, a number of
observations can be made in respect of the form of the alternating stems: continuative
stems mostly end in /ɑ/; verb stems that end in a consonant alternate the final
consonant only. It may be concluded that the stem alternation morphology is no longer
productive.","[106, 107, 108, 109]"

demonstratives indicate the proximate discourse location of referents (or events). The
referents (or events) are shared information of both speech participants and may be
considered definite. Such referents (or events) are focused or topical. In the second
row, the anaphoric demonstratives o/lo and yo are given. They indicate the medial (less
proximate) discourse location of referents (or events) in shared discourse. The referents
may be considered definite.
        In the third row of the table, the forms hu (SPC) and nu (SPC.AD) are given.14
The anaphoric demonstrative hu serves as a ‘specific’ marker; it is glossed as (SPC). 15 It
indicates that the referent (or event) is ‘specific’ in the sense that is it ‘accessible’ within
the discourse of the speaker. However, the specificity does not necessarily extend to the
addressee. In fact, the speaker typically uses the demonstrative hu to introduce new
information into the shared discourse. The demonstrative hu contrasts with the
anaphoric demonstrative nu. The anaphoric demonstrative nu indicates that the
referent (or event) is ‘specific’ also from the perspective of the addressee, in the sense
that it is accessible for the speaker in his own ‘discourse’ and shared with the

15 The anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC.AD) is the grammaticalized index verb stem hu ‘be.like.else.PRF’,which is a homogeneous complex verb. This CV is derived from the generic roots h ‘lack’ and u ‘leave’
indicating that the specific referent has been ‘seen’ previously only by the speaker and is not accessible of the
addressee.

addressee. 16 The speaker typically uses the demonstrative nu to refer to specific
information that is present in the context and already known to the addressee.
       The use of the anaphoric demonstratives in both domains is illustrated below.
Only the axis SPEAKER-ADDRESSEE and PROXIMAL-DISTAL apply to anaphoric
demonstratives. In (126), the proximal anaphoric demonstratives do (PRX) and to
(PRX.AD) are given.(126) a. kaai do                                        b. kaai to

         ‘the dog (I just talked about)’                      ‘the dog (you just talked about)’The use of the anaphoric demonstratives given in (126) is exemplified in (127). In both
cases, the referent fala ‘house’ expresses an argument of the verb fak ‘break’. In (a), a
neutral case is given. In (b), the referent fala ‘house’ is located as proximate in the
discourse of the addressee. The speaker refers to the house that the addressee talked
about. The demonstrative to is used to draw addressee’s attention.(127) a. fala      do          fak-i

proximate in discourse and as shared information of both speech participants. Such a
referent is traditionally considered definite.
       In (128), the noun kawen ‘machete’ is followed by the anaphoric demonstrative
do (PRX).(128) kawen      do,         a      ha-komang-d-i-a                 naha!

a situation in which Waksi makes nice drawings in his book. Simon wants to have a
look at his book, and asks Waksi to lend him his book. Waksi is afraid that Simon will
lose it and tells Simon that he wants to make a copy of his book before Simon may
borrow it. He uses the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) in order to refer to his own
book that Simon talked about.","[136, 137]"
"       7.4     Summary of the semantic contribution of generic roots
As demonstrated in the sections above, the homogeneous CVs frequently encode
locomotion and motion events. They offer an interesting look in the event
decomposition of the motion and locomotion events in Abui. The structure of these
events is schematically represented in (137) and compared with the structure of the
heterogeneous CVs.

When Abui speakers translate the meaning of a complex verb, they often use hand
gestures that express the locus and indicate the trajectory of the event (for instance the
                                      COMPLEX VERBS                                      345
verb d ‘hold’ is illustrated by putting one hand on the top of an object, or just on the
table, the verb t ‘lie’ is illustrated by putting both hands on each other, etc.). They often
find it difficult to translate an Abui verb with a Malay equivalent unable to capture the
polysemy of Abui verbs. Systematic research into this use of gesture could provide
additional insights in the type of event decompositions suggested in this chapter.
             8 Serial Verb Constructions
In general, Abui speakers use more verbs to refer to simple events than English
speakers. In (1) the expressed events of ‘taking back’ and ‘bringing back’ are spelled out
in serial verb constructions that describe the event components in step by step fashion.1(1)      a. ha-wai            mi-a!                       b. na mi            ha-wai           miei
             3II.PAT-turn take-DUR                              1SG take 3II.PAT-turn          come.CPL
             ‘take it back!’                                    ‘I brought it back’Serial verb constructions (SVCs) are often thought of as verb clusters without any over
marker of coordination or subordination. Foley and Olson (1985) argue that the verbs
in SVCs behave as a single predicate in a simple clause with respect to grammatical
operators such as negation or aspectual inflection. As illustrated in (1), Abui SVCs
consist minimally of two verbs (a), but often more verbs are serialized (b). In a SVC,
different meaning components of the verbs may be activated (cf. Crowley, 2002:22-3).
This is illustrated (2). The verb me ‘come’ encodes direction in (a), while in (b) it
encodes manner and perhaps some aspect (gradual change).(2)      a. di tur-i                   ya      mi      me            b. di me            ha-rik-i

             ‘she scooped up and brought it (towards DC)                   ‘he got gradually ill’In view of this Abui SVCs should not be dealt with as a single construction, but rather
as a collection of constructions sharing the same set of conceptual, grammatical,
morpho-syntactic and semantic properties (cf. Crowley 2002:1-23).
        In section 8.1, I give grammatical, compositional and semantic characteristics of
Abui SVCs. Compositional characteristics of SVCs are taken as the main criterion in
describing Abui SVCs (8.1.2). They are described as symmetrical or asymmetrical,
following the dichotomy established by Aikhenvald (2006). In section 8.2, I describe
symmetrical SVCs in which the verbs have ‘equal’ grammatical status. The verbs in
symmetrical SVCs encode the reported event in a step by step fashion by listing the
verbs.
        The asymmetrical SVCs consist of a two verbs of ‘unequal’ grammatical status.
The ‘minor verb’ has a grammatical function as the verb me ‘come’ in (2). The ‘major
verb’ is the semantic head of the SVC. I distinguish two types of asymmetrical SVCs
taking the syntactic position of the ‘minor’ verb as the formal criterion. In section 8.3, I
describe asymmetrical SVCs in which the minor verb follows the major verb. The
minor verb expresses aspect, direction, manner and mood.","[366, 367, 368, 369, 370]"
