Dóòhseewa is used inwh-questions where the focus element of question is the reason, as in the questions in (67) and(68).

        Plural and singular forms in questions are distinguished by the presence of the pluralsuffix -ˀo that follows the future suffix, as in (222). In (223), an additional cue is provided by theplurlal suppletive stem nááhi to go which is used in lieu of néè to go to indicate plural subjects.","[304, 305]"
        In some respects noun stripping looks strikingly similar to the article-less NP described in9.1. One question that needs to be answered by future research is whether the sequence of ageneric noun and verb is subject to any adjacency requirements.,[230]
Question marks in (117) indicate unattested forms.,[170]
"       In response to the question iidáàwiˀ? how many are there? (see 12.2.2), one answers withthe appropriate cardinal number that is usually preceded by the instrumental prefix ii-, especiallyif the numeral is pluralized to stress that the group consists of individuals (see 4.2.2). Twocardinal numbers, núùba two and náàwii three, have irregular forms when combined with theinstrumental prefix: iirúba two and iiráwi three. Examples are given in (5).",[467]

directives and first person plural question forms in cohortative expressions. An example of acohortative is (231) and examples of directives are (232)–(233). It is important to bear in mindthat only context, facial expression, or intonational cues tell whether an interrogative speech-actis to be interpreted as a question or a cohortative suggestion, or a declarative speech-act as astatement or a directive.","[306, 307]"

6.1.2.3 -dóòg ‘speculative’Sentences ending with the speculative suffix -dóòg can be translated into English as “I wonder”or “could it be that”. The speculative is used for introspective questions addressed to oneself andit indicates that the speaker is uncertain about his judgment.","[263, 264]"
       Examples (26a) and (26b) shed further light on the question. If Hiraaciréˀhaa in (26b)were a causative verb in a contemporaneous clause it would mean ‘to make sb speak Hidatsa’.,[496]
       Past (realis) events are referred to by combining *dúàhga when with the past suffix -siand the temporal-locative suffix -rú (see 17.4.1.1). Questions with dúàhgasiru when are in (72)and (73).,[461]
"
       Both statements and questions containing future suffixes are sometimes translated with‘should’ or ‘ought to’, as in (234)–(239). Again, the exact interpretation depends on the specificcontextual circumstances of the speech act.",[307]
"       Speech-act markers in Hidatsa can be divided into three categories of unequal size:statements, commands, and questions. Each category contains a number of grammaticalizedspeech acts identified by traditional grammatical labels, such as interrogative, declarative, andimperative. The feature differentiating minor speech-act types from each other in each of thethree categories is the force of assertion. The statements category comprises the largest numberof grammaticalized speech acts, questions have three, and commands two. As Givón (1984: 318)has pointed out, the “major well-coded speech-acts [i.e., statements, questions, and commands]are just the most common, conventionalized (‘grammaticalized’) prototypes”. In reality, theprototypes are distributed along a continuum space organized along a number of social-psychological dimensions (Givón 1984: 318).",[247]
"First and foremost, this grammar would not have been possible without the fulltime commitmentby my most important collaborators, Rosaria Starr and Arvella White, who spent countless hourspatiently answering my questions, expanding paradigms, and translating texts. This work is asmuch theirs as it is mine. I would also like to thank all the other Hidatsa speakers whoparticipated in this project, especially, Fred Gunn, Carol-Ann Newman, Bryan Brady, andLouann Phelan, and countless others who willingly shared their time and knowledge with me.",[7]
"           In content questions and indefinite statements, an absolutive S argument of an intransitiveclause or an O argument of a transitive clause is indicated by the interrogative pronoun dáàbawa,as in (21). Dáàbari is used for ergative A arguments in transitive clauses, as in (22). The focuselement of dáàbawa and dáàbari is always non-human.",[450]
"       Example (7a) demonstrates that only -rú is grammatical with the D-words dóò where (see12.2.9) and agudóò which one (see 12.1.3). Although the interrogative pronoun agudóò-ru inwhich one in (7a) is grammatical only with the locative suffix -rú, there are no constrainst againstanswering the question in (7b) with -hgua instead of -rú.",[517]
"
        In the spoken language the first person plural question form, used in interrogative speech-acts and cohortative expressions, is often contracted by deleting the second syllable in -wihi andadding the optionally lengthened plural -ˀo directly to the first syllable, as in (224).",[305]
"                                                                                             430

12.2.1 dusáàci ‘what kind’Dusáàci to be some way, be some kind is a stative verb that is mostly used in questions. Examplesare seen in (38)–(40). An indefinite interrogative pronoun, marked with the distributive suffix, isin (41).","[453, 454]"
"Possible combinations of pronominal affixes in the stem are given in TABLE 17.1. The agent(benefactor) affixes are underlined, and the object (beneficiary) affixes are given in bold. Thirdperson agent and object forms are not marked by affixation. Unattested but possible forms areindicated with a question mark. Imperative and precative forms are given in their singular andplural forms.",[565]
"       Finally, the focus morpheme derives interrogative pronouns from D-words that are stativeverbs (see 12.1). D-words that are derived with -wa are used to ask questions about the non-ergative arguments S and O. The ergative case marker -rí is suffixed to the same stem instead of -wa if the question asked is about the ergative argument A. D-words with -wa may be used                                                                                                  370

"       Since the morphological categories comprising modal notions are clearly the mostmisunderstood — yet paradoxically the best “known” features in Hidatsa — I will provide moreexamples and data in each subsection of this chapter than is the usual practice in descriptivegrammars. I will raise a few questions and identify aspects that need further clarification, but inthe end I hope to provide a comprehensive description of the notions of modality, aspect, andtense in Hidatsa.",[246]
"       Finally, when used in isolation and without any speech-act markers, dabéè!? Who isthere!? is used as an exclamatory query (see 14.2) as when someone is knocking at the door.12.1.2 dáàba ‘what’Dáàba to be what is a stative verb that is used to ask questions and make statements about theidentity of non-human referents, as in (19) and (20).",[449]
"Cohortative expressions can only be used in first person plural utterances. They are translatedinto English as ‘let’s V’. With some verbs, such as néè to go in (72), cohortative expressions canalso be interpreted as questions. The exact interpretation depends on the context, intonation, andother similar factors. Some verbs and situations allow only the cohortative reading of suchconstructions.",[263]
"12.1 Pronominal D-wordsThree D- words, dabéè to be who, dáàba to be what, and agudóò to be which one are stativeverbs that in a matrix clause occur mostly, but not exclusively, in questions. They are alsoextremely common in the dependent conditional and concessive clauses, in which case theyfunction as nonassertive indefinite pronouns.",[444]
"17.1 Independent clausesWith the exception of exclamations (see Chapter 14), every independent utterance terminateswith an illocutionary marker that identifies the clause as a type of statement, question, orcommand. Speech acts and illocutionary suffixes marking independent clauses are discussed indetail in 6.1.",[539]
"14.2 Exclamatory phrasesExclamatory phrases are nonsentences formed with lexemes that have an independent semanticvalue. They are classified as exclamations because they always occur without illocutionarymarkers (see 6.1) and do not enter into syntactic relations. A question mark in (25), for instance,suggests an interrogative speech-act, but the absence of the interrogative speech-act marker -ˀindicates that the utterance is actually an exclamation.",[481]
"       The negative counterpart of the affirmative interjection éè yes, which cannot be usedpredicatively, is neehá no. Neehá is actually a stative verb that means ‘to not be something’.",[480]
