9.6.1     Yes/no
          Yes/no questions can have any order. They often end with the tag aiñe o ndoñ ‘yes or
no?’ In (20a) the clause is verb final, whereas in (20b) the main verb jan ‘go’ is first with the
complement jenokwedam ‘eat together’ and the deictic ‘to there’ following it. In (20c) the verb
jan ‘go’ shows different morphology than the usual affirmative tonja for the third singular past.
Also, the question ends with the tag aiñe o ndoñ. In (20d) the word order is OSV and the
question ends with the particle ka. (20e) shows a longer yes/no question with an embedded
clause.",[242]

1.6.3   Word order and syntax
        The basic order of basic constituents in Kamsá seems to be SOV but it is extremely
flexible and is also perhaps becoming SVO under the influence of Spanish. Kamsá is dependent-                                                 27
marking, with possessors being marked morphologically rather than the thing possessed. The
language also exhibits agreement, with adjectives agreeing with nouns in class, number, and
sometimes case. Oblique phrases tend to follow the subject of the clause and can precede or
follow the verb. Negators almost always precede verbs. Kamsá has mostly postpositions,
although it also has some prepositions that it has borrowed from Spanish. There are some
subordinators that are clause-initial and others that are clause final. In possessive constructions,
the possessor precedes the possessum (possessed) and is marked with a genitive case ending.
Adjectives can either follow or precede the nouns that they modify. Demonstratives and
numerals always precede nouns. Kamsá may be considered a pro-drop language, in that an overt
subject is not a necessary syntactic element.
        Kamsá has nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment. In the third person, S and
A (not O) trigger verbal agreement. There can be also object marking on verbs, mainly for first
and second person objects. When the verb is ditransitive, if the goal is first or second person, it is
marked on the verb (not the theme). Kamsá has a strange characteristic of having dual marking
when there is a transitive sentence with an animate agent and patient. This could be polysemy.
        There is wh-movement for questions: question words always come at the beginning of the
clause. Polar (‘yes/no’) questions do not necessitate any change in word order, and no special
particle is needed, although the tag aiñ o ndoñ ‘yes or no’ is commonly added to the end of the
question with a difference in intonation. Comparatives and superlatives are formed with the
Spanish loanword más ‘more’. Both nouns and adjectives can function as predicate
complements, either without a copula or with an inflected ‘be’ verb.","[40, 41]"

        Although word order in Kamsá is quite free, question words are always at the start of the
clause when WH questions are formed. The only words that can precede question word are
adverbs. Subjects, objects, and verbs always come after the question word. The remaining
                                               230
constituents of the clause can be in any word order. Figure 9.1 shows the question words in
Kamsá.","[242, 243, 244]"

9.5.1   Morphological imperatives
        Imperatives are formed with m- before the verb root. There is no other morphology. In
(18a) jabo ‘come’ has m- as does j-olempia ‘clean’ (from Spanish limpiar ‘clean’) in (18b).
(18a) mabo
      mabo
      ‘Come!’ (MC)(18b) Mwata molempia. Kanÿaná kochjase,

      ‘Clean these two, and eat one of the them.’ (Chindoy 94:6)9.5.2   Future as imperative
        Another common way to make a command is by using the future. In (19a) the verb j-
areparan ‘watch’ is marked with the second singular marker ko- followed by the future prefix                                              228
ch- as in (19b) with jatbana ‘collect’. (19c) is repeated from above and shows both strategies of
command: the morphological imperative mo-lempia ‘Clean!’ and the future as imperative with
kochjase ‘Eat!’.(19a) Pero kochantsareparan ndweñangbiama.

          Word order in Kamsa is very free. Yes/no questions can have any word order. WH
questions, however, generally have the question word first with other constituents following the
question word. Adverbs can precede the question word. Sometimes the evidentiality is different
with only j- and not n-, the marker for things the speaker has seen or experienced. The verb
jamnan ‘be’ often has the prefix yo- in questions, but I have not determined the use of this prefix.","[241, 242]"

10.3.2 Subordinate clauses with other question words
       In addition to nts̈amo ‘how’, other question words can be used to form subordinate
clauses. These include nda ‘who’, ndayents̈ ‘where’, ndayek ‘why’, and ndaya ‘what’. These
subordinators are identical in form to their respective interrogatives (9.6.2). They always come at
the beginning of the clause. (8) shows a sentence with several subordinate clauses, including the
question words ndayek ‘why’, ndayents̈ ‘where’, and nda ‘who’, and nts̈amo ‘how’.","[256, 257]"

nda ‘who’ in intransitive questions. (21d) and (21e) show ndmoy ‘to where’ in intransitive
sentences. In (21d) the subject is not realized, whereas in (21e) it is and the verb is the last word
in the question. (21f) and (21g) both have questions with ndayek ‘why’ and have different word
orders: in (21f) it is verb then subject and in (21g) there is no verb. In (21i) the question word

"         Thus, while nts̈amo ‘how’ is a question word and—as such—functions much like the

        There are two main negators in Kamsá: ndoñ and tonday. They are also discussed in
section 9.3 on negation. ndoñ means ‘no’ and can precede words: verbs, nouns, adjectives as
well as be the answer to a yes/no question. Generally, ndoñ precedes the thing it is negating, as
seen in (39a) in which it precedes a verb; in (39b) in which it precedes an NP; (39c) in which it
precedes chka ‘in this way’; (39d) in which it precedes mas ‘more’; and in (39e) in which it
precedes and adjective: ts̈aba ‘good’.(39a) Ats̈na jenanufja ndoñ kes̈natajaboto.

10.4.1 Paratactic reported speech
           One strategy for encoding reported speech is to have the verb of speaking followed by
that which is said, without any subordinators or other indicators that two clauses are being
linked. In (25a), the verb j-ayana ‘say’ is followed by the clause detailing that which is said.(25a) Chanjayana cha ats̈be ents̈á yomna ka.
      chan-jayana cha        ats̈be           ents̈á yo-mna         ka

      <ca> in original orthography.)10.4.2 Reported speech using subordinators
           Reported speech can be encoded with the subordinator nts̈amo ‘how’, as well as with
other question words. In (26a) the reported speech is shown with nts̈amo ‘how’ followed by the
verb j-apasan ‘happen’. In (26b) the reported speech is also shown with nts̈amo but the verb is
an infinitive. In (26c) there are two clauses of reported speech. nts̈amo is also discussed in 10.3
on subordination and 9.6.2 on questions.(26a) Ibsana ch viajeratna bojakwentá kaserbioy

between (27a) and (27b) where the verb j-amnan ‘be’ in (27a) is marked with the unkown
evidential marker j- in the indirect question and in (27b) is marked with n-, the known evidential

2.2.1.5 Vowel-glide sequences and glide-vowel sequences
          There are no diphthongs in Kamsá, in that it is never the case that multiple vowels form
the nucleus of a syllable. There are, however, two possible sequences of vowel-plus-glide in
Kamsá (/aj/ and /oj/), as well as four possible sequences of glide-plus-vowel (/je/, /jo/, /ja/, and
/wa/). The vowel-plus-glide sequences both contain the palatal glide /j/ as their coda; the glide-
plus-vowel sequences can begin with either the palatal glide /j/ or the labio-velar glide /w/,
                                                   39
although there are limitations on which vowels may form the nucleus of the syllable. Kamsá
syllable structure forbids vowel sequences: any vowel sequences that could potentially occur are
broken up by the insertion of a glide./aj/The sequence /aj/ has wide distribution. It can be at the beginning of a word, as in ajnan ‘heart’;
it can be at the end of a word, as in wafxaxonaj ‘lagoon’; and it can be somewhere in the middle
of a word (with a consonant forming the onset of the syllable), as in tajta ‘father’./oj/The sequence /oj/ is also common. It can be at the beginning of a word, as in ojena ‘inhabitant’;
it can be at the end of a word, as in tabanoj ‘to(ward) the town’; and it can be somewhere in the
middle of a word (with a consonant forming the onset of the syllable), as in soj ‘thing’ or boja
‘man’./jV/Glides can also form the onset (or part of the onset of a syllable. The palatal glide /j/ can occur
before three vowels: /e/, /a/, and /o/. That is, it may precede non-high vowels (*ji, *jɨ, *ju are not
attested). There can also be word initial onsets with j- followed by a vowel, such as the distant
past marker je-.je: betje ‘tree’
ja: atʂbjam ‘for me’
jo: atʂbjoka ‘at my place’
joj: atʂbjoj ‘to me’
/wa/The labio-velar glide /w/ can also precede a vowel, although it has a much more restricted
distribution: /w/ can only precede the low vowel /a/. There is no /w/ without a following vowel,
but /w/ can be word initial as seen in the word waben ‘sister of a man’.ʃbwaya ‘hunter’
ʃekwatʂ ‘foot’
                                                  40
waben ‘sister of a man’        In sum, there are four phonemic vowels in Kamsa that have wide distribution and that
contrast with one another (/u/, /e/, /o/, and /a)/. There are also two vowels whose phonemic status
is questioned, as their occurrence is predictable accept for minor exceptions (/ɨ/ and /i/). There
are several vowel-glide and glide-vowel sequences, but vowel sequences are prohibited.","[52, 53, 54]"

the first two (with ndayents̈ ‘where’ and ndayá ‘what’), the verb is marked with bi-, which is
perhaps a subjunctive marker. In the third subordinate clause, nts̈amo is followed by the
infinitive j-oshacheñán ‘find’. The fourth subordinate clause is really two clauses, ‘what would
happen/how it would happen’ and ‘when they collect (the) gold’. The first begins with nts̈amo

temporal subordinator ora ‘when’ (see 11.3.4).","[257, 258]"

<ë> (ɨ)
          The high central vowel is problematic for several reasons. First, it is difficult to determine
whether it is actually a phoneme, because—for most (but not all) words—it is phonologically
predictable. Second, it is often inserted as an epenthetic vowel between consonants, particularly
nasals. These issues are discussed in greater depth above on the phonology of the language. The
third difficulty is the question of how to write this vowel. Most authors have chosen <ë>, so I am
following the literature by using that symbol. McDowell (2014) does not write it at all; instead,
when he believes it to be epenthetic, he excludes it completely and when he believes it to be
underlying /u/ or /e/, he writes it as <u> or <e> accordingly.
<w, y>
          Glides: I have decided to write <w> although many Kamsa writers use <u>.",[65]

       The question word ndayents̈ ‘where’ is used to form subordinate clauses as well. In (11a),
it is used to form a subordinate clause meaning ‘where the cathedral is now’. In (11b), it is
negated by the negator ndoka to mean ‘there is nowhere…’, perhaps an existential matrix clause
with null copula: “(there was) not [where he could be]” In (11c), the people are talking about
where to shoot the hawk who has been hunting their chickens and they say to aim for ‘where he
breathes’.(11a) Chiyekna primer nÿos̈ yebuna tojëbtsojebo

10.3.2.3       Subordinate clauses with nda ‘who’
       Finally, the question nda ‘who’ may be used as a subordinator as well, as seen in (12a)

       161:11)10.3.3 Temporal subordinate clauses with ora ‘when’
       Temporal clauses may use the subordinator ora ‘when’, which derives from Spanish hora
‘hour, time, term’. Unlike the question words discussed in the previous sections (which come at
the beginning of the clause), the subordinator ora comes at the end of the clause. In (13a), ora is
the final element of the subordinate clause ‘when the field-owner didn’t see her’. In (13b), this
word comes at the end of the clause ‘when the deer was tired’. Sometimes the forms or, gor, or
orna may be used instead of ora (note orna in 13b, gor in 13c and 13d). (13d) shows a
simultaneous action in the past. Temporal clauses with ora can either precede the main clause (as
in 13a, 13b, and 13c) or follow the main clause (as in 13d); the order is flexible.(13a) Ch jaja dweñna bojets̈e ora yejenojwaboy:

      ‘Yesterday I was looking for (the) cat when it was raining.’ (MC)10.3.4 Subordinate clauses with =as
       A common strategy for subordinate clauses is employing the clitic =as, which comes at
the end of the subordinate clause. It tends to attach to the verb, but it can attach to the end of the
VP. It is possibly a clause level clitic, related to the word as ‘then’ which may derive from
Spanish así ‘thus, therefore, so, like that, in this way’. The word as, however, comes at the
beginning of clauses, whereas the clitic =as comes at the end of the clause. Semantically, =as
seems to be like the Greek participle where one does not know if it is causal, concessive,
temporal, etc. It can be used for past, present and future.
       In (14a) =as is on the verb j-apasan ‘happen’ (which can also mean ‘be’) and has a
causal meaning. In (14b), =as is on j-obobekon ‘get close’ for a temporal meaning, for two
things happening simultaneously. In (14c) it is on j-obebi-an ‘bathe’ for a temporal meaning, as
well. In (14d) it is on the verb j-atersi-an ‘drape’ and has a temporal meaning. In (14e) it is on
two verbs before the main verb j-atsënts̈e ‘push’. In (14f) the adversative clause has the
subordinator =as in kondbomnas ‘you having’. It is strange in that it uses pero, or that pero can
be used redundantly with =as.(14a) Ats̈na yap lastem tsjisepasas

                            Sentences and multi-clausal constructions
10.1     Introduction
         In this chapter I examine Kamsá sentences that are composed of more than one clause (in
addition to considering the coordination of multiple elements within a single clause). Two (or
more) clauses may be combined in Kamsá, either through coordination or through subordination.
When two clauses are coordinated, they maintain an equal grammatical status. A subordinate
clause, on the other hand, is dependent upon another (main) clause. Both coordination and
subordination can be signalled (in part) through the use of a class of words called conjunctions.
         First I discuss coordination (10.2), including conjunctive coordination (10.2.1),
disjunctive coordination (10.2.2), adversative coordination (10.2.3), and correlatives (10.2.4). In
(10.3) I discuss subordination strategies, and (10.4) is dedicated to indirect discourse.
         Kamsá has several conjunctions, including both coordinators and subordinators. Many of
the coordinators, which can connect words or phrases as well as entire clauses, are derived from
Spanish. Figure 10.1 shows the most commonly used conjunctions in Kamsá, providing basic
glosses and etymologies (where known).","[245, 246, 247]"

        First, I would like to thank all of the Kamsás who welcomed me into their lives: Carmen,
without whom nothing would have been possible; Margarita, Clemencia, Anita, and Maria
Clementina for teaching me their language; Alejandro for all the wonderful conversations about
language, philosophy, and life; as well as Margarita, Andrés, Ivan, Miguel, Luis, Sandra, and
Rosita.
        I have been extremely lucky to have worked with Lyle Campbell, who is the best advisor
anyone could ever hope for. I would also like to thank my committee members, William
O’Grady, Gary Holton, Bob Blust, and Alex Mawyer; and Robert Littman, who was the reason I
was able to do a graduate degree at the University of Hawai‘i.
        My friends in Bogotá offered me incredible support. I would like to thank Pipe for
dedicating his time to working with me on Kamsá; Gustavo, whose conversations kept me going;
Jennifer for always being willing to accompany me into the jungle; Andrea, one of the most
lovely people in the world; Andrés for the evenings in La Candelaria; Edinson for our lunches
together; Daniel for being my bodyguard; Francisco and Gloria for their hospitality; Lili for
being my Colombian mother and friend; Javier for the inspiration; David for the breaks from el
centro; Leidy for sharing insights about Kamsá; Camilo for being wonderful; Jorge for our
mornings in Juan Valdez; Paul for the walks in the rain; Laura and Rajiv … I don’t know where
to begin; Gerriet for always helping; Arturo for becoming my friend at BBC; Ricardo for our
time together; Fernando for helping me before I knew Spanish; Mauricio for making things a
little more fun; Alejandro and Juan for giving me a home; Yinneth for her great knowledge; Katy
for the chats over coffee; and Youlin for helping me before she even knew me. There have been
many other people in Colombia whom I’m grateful to as well: Luisa for opening her home to me;
Henry in Sibundoy; Gloria in Manizales.
        Some friends from the US visited me during my time in Colombia, making my time there
even more pleasant. I’d like to thank John for making the first trip to Sibundoy with me; Ariane
for staying in touch … hopefully we see each other more; Noah, these years have been crazy;
Erik for always being there to talk and helping edit more drafts of things than I can count;
Joachim for being willing to do anything; Craig for being a great friend and going with me to the
beach.
        Other friends who’ve been supportive during my degree, some of whom I’ve known
since elementary school, some I’ve met more recently: Don, Vlad, Laura, Jonathan, and Verna.
I’d also like to thank my parents.
        Other mentors who have guided me during my PhD include Bryan, without whom I may
never have done academia; Caleb for always seeming to believe in me; Thiago for offering
advice along the way in Colombia; and Brett for the advice and contacts, starting in Cambridge.
        I’d like to thank friends and classmates in Hawai‘i who’ve helped in various ways
throughout the PhD process: Eve, Kirsten, Samantha, Kavon, John, Ryan, Sejung, Victoria,
George, Laura, Clara, Kevin, Adila, and Melody.
        I am also grateful for the generous agencies that have helped fund my research including
the Bilinski Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the American Association of
University Women, and the Foundation for Endangered Languages.
        Finally, I’d like to thank Russell.

                                         ABSTRACT
        This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangered
language isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
        Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.

                                           Introduction
1.1    Summary
       This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangered
language isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
       Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.
       This introductory chapter to this dissertation is organized as follows:
In 1.2, I discuss the Kamsá people and language, including the location, culture, relationship to
other languages, borrowing, and the name of the language. In 1.3 I discuss the language ecology
and language vitality, and in 1.4 I discuss previous research on the language. In 1.5 I describe my
methodology, and in 1.6 I give a typological overview of the language.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

10.3.1 Subordinate clauses with nts̈amo ‘how, what happened’
          A common subordinator is nts̈amo ‘how’, which (in such constructions) is used much like
the English word ‘what’. To see how nts̈amo is used in questions, see 9.6.2. In (7a), nts̈amo
‘how’ subordinates the clause ‘horrible [things] happened’ to the main clause ‘the older brother
… returned to see’. In (7b), nts̈amo ‘how’ is used for ‘how it happened’. In (7c), it is in a
subordinate clause following the main verb montsetats̈ëmbo ‘they (didn’t) know’ with an
                                                  242
infinitive j-tsenojwanan ‘get rid of’. The verb in this subordinate clause j-tsenojwanan ‘get rid
of’ is not inflected.(7a)     Wbochená natsán wabwatmá kastellan binÿnoy, yejobaye ora,

4.2.3   Third person singular: i- or ton-
        Third person singular subjects are indexed on the verb with the vowel i- in the present,
future, and distant past tenses and to- in the past tense. (There is yet another form for the third
person singular distant past: ye-. The difference between the distant past with i- and the distant
past with ye- is as yet undetermined and is discussed further in 4.4.7). Finally, when a transitive
verb has a third person singular subject and a first or second person (singular, plural, or dual)
object, the subject is not marked; only the object is marked. Phonetically, the i- for third person
singular habitual is often reduced to [ë].
        In (6a) and (6b), the tense/aspect of the verb is present/habitual and the subject is a third
person singular referent. In (6a), the subject is cha, the third person singular pronoun. In (6b), the
subject is kes̈ ‘dog’, In (6c), the verb j-wabwan ‘cook’ has the future marker chan- with the third
person singular marker i- preceding chan- and indexing a third person singular (pronominal)
subject.(6a)    Kadaté cha indwabwán wameshnen.

       Indirect speech is encoded in Kamsá with a verb of speaking, followed by the thing being
told (without any subordinators). Some common verbs used for introducing indirect discourse
are:j-ayanan ‘say’
j-auyanan ‘say’
j-atjayan ‘ask’                                               252
j-ojwan ‘answer’
j-aparlan ‘tell’
j-akwentan ‘tell’
j-obwambayan ‘say, declare’          The following two examples show the verbs jojwan ‘answer’ and jatjayan ‘ask’, each
having an object of the VP: in (21a) kanÿe palabra ‘one word’ and in (21b) kanÿe soy ‘one
thing’.(21a) Chora ndokná tonjanobená ni mo kanÿe palabra jojwana.

marked in the object marking slot of the verb. In (22), the verb j-awentan ‘tell’ is marked with
the first person object marker s̈o-. s̈o- is the marker for first person objects in transitive
sentences or the goal in ditransitive sentences.","[265, 266]"
"
4.4.1   Aspect: non-past habitual nd- and non-past progressive ts-
        The aspect markers nd- and ts- come after the person and number markers, and also after
the evidential markers, if there are evidential markers. Thus, they are the inflectional prefixes
closest to the verb root. (Footnote: derivational prefixes can occur between these inflectional
prefixes and the root) nd- and ts- precede the verbal root. Often, epenthetic vowel /ë / is added
after the aspect marker, before the verb root. This seems to be phonological or phonetic rather
than morphological. Neither nd- nor ts- is obligatory; verbs can be marked without aspect. nd-
marks habitual in the present or future, and ts- marks a progressive action in the past or future.
        Note that there is homophony between the habitual prefix nd- and negative prefix nd-.
They have different functions, and appear in different slots. The negative prefix nd is discussed
in 4.9.3.
        In (40a-b), ts- shows actions that are currently happening: cooking and changing. ts- is
between the evidentiality marker n- and the verb root in both examples. (40c-f) show nd- for
habitual actions and states. In (40c) and (40d), nd- shows a constant state, being able to sing,
having a house, and usually waiting. In (40c), the verb is also ongoing, non-completed. Thus, nd-
could also be interpreted as non-completive.(40a) Mor ats̈ mënts̈en sëntsabwana

nd- and ts-. In (41a) i-nd-emën shows a characteristic of the leaf, whereas in (41b) i-n-ts-emën is
a temporary state, the bird being in a tree. Note that in Kamsá jamnan ‘be’ inflects in the same
way as other verbs.(41a) kem tsbuanach bëtsich indemën

on joyejwa ‘be happy’.(42)       ats̈be enuta ts̈aba i-n-ts-oyejwa

Because
batá ‘aunt’ has a final stressed vowel which cannot be deleted (as in other words that have final
stressed vowels, but unlike words that have optional final vowels; see Chapter 2 on the
phonology). When batá is dual, batá + at becomes batát. When batá is plural, batá + ëng
becomes batáng.(kanÿe) kes̈ ‘one dog’
(uta) kes̈-at ‘two dogs’
(unga) kes̈-ëng ‘three dogs’(kanÿe) batá ‘one aunt’
(uta) bata-t ‘two aunts’
(unga) bata-ng ‘three aunts’                                                   67
Nouns that end in -n become -ng in the plural as seen below, where s̈es̈on ‘baby’ becomes
s̈es̈ong. and begon ‘fish’ becomes begong in the plural. Thus the n → Ø /__+ng ?s̈es̈on ‘baby’
s̈es̈ong ‘babies’begon ‘fish’
begong ‘fish (pl)’        The evidence that these are suffixes rather than separate words or clitics can be seen with
nouns that undergo a phonological change when the plural or dual marker is added, as seen
above with nouns that end in vowels, such as bata ‘aunt’ which is batang in the plural, ‘aunts’.
Also, nouns that end in -n undergo a phonological change when the plural marker is added, as
seen where the plural of begon ‘fish’ is begong ‘fish (pl)’ The second piece of evidence that
these are suffixes rather than separate words is that psychologically speakers think that they are
part of the word based on questions I have asked consultants. Finally, -at and -ng never stand on
their own.
        In Kamsá, the dual and plural markers are optional. In (28), three options for marking
dual can be seen. In (28a), the uta viajerata 'two travelers' has both the numeral two and a dual
suffix, -at. In (28b), viajerata has the dual suffix but not numeral. In (28c), the noun tjok
‘mountain’ is modified by uta 'two' but has no dual marker. In (28d), the ungrammatical example
shows that plural cannot be used for dual. Note that (28c) has the determiner ch to mark
definiteness/specificity whereas (28a) and (28b) do not.(28a) uta byajerata

and without a number and without a plural marker (29d), where the context makes it clear that

sometimes the adjective agree with the noun. There is a diminutive -tem, a pejorative -ëfja with
allomorphs -ëja and -ëfa, and a suffix for ‘poor’ -jema.","[80, 81, 82]"

       from Spanish mago ‘magus’; ora from Spanish hour ‘hour’.)10.5   Causative constructions
       Causatives are formed morphologically. They are formed by adding the object pronoun
prefix to the verb. A causative meaning is formed by putting an object pronoun marker on the
verb, thus, increasing valency, going from ‘she cried’ vs. ‘she cried me’ = increase valency of
‘cry’ by 1, meaning it now takes a direct object, and therefore, since ‘cry’ is semantically
inherently intransitive, with the object the sense is a verb with both a subject and an object,
hence causative. As far as I know, there is no analytic version, i.e. no multiword construction
like ‘make someone do something’ composed of some independent ‘make’-like auxiliary or verb
plus another verb. In (28a) there is an intransitive sentence with the verb j-os̈achn ‘cry’. It is
marked with to- to show past and third singular subject. In causative (28b) j-os̈achn ‘cry’is
marked with the direct object pronominal prefix s̈o-. In (28c) the verb is marked with the dual
bo-. In (28d) only the first person subject is marked with te-, an alternate past form for the first
person singular. The function of j- is unclear. In (28c) the bo- shows that there is an animate
subject and an animate object, while in (28d) the verbal prefix (28d) just marks first person
singular subject and past tense. In (28e-f) a causative with a transitive verb jasan ‘eat’ is shown.","[269, 270]"

       A verb phrase in Kamsá consists minimally of a verb (8.3.1), but can, alternatively,
consist of a verb and its direct object (8.3.2), a verb and an oblique object (8.3.3), a verb and two
objects (ditransitive verbal constructions) (8.3.4), a verb, a direct object, and an oblique object
(8.3.5), a verb and an adverb (8.3.6), and a verb and a verbal complement (8.3.7), among other
possible combinations. Some (semantically) transitive verbs have within their argument structure
an object marked with an oblique case (8.3.8). There are also other possible pairings not
discussed here.","[215, 216]"

4.2.1 First person singular: së- and Ø-
           Verbs with first person singular subjects are marked with the prefix së- in the present
progressive, habitual, and past. They are unmarked (or marked with the null marker Ø-) in the
future. There is one small class of verbs where first person singular is te- in the past.
           In the following sentences, the first person pronominal agreement prefix on the verb is
së-, shown with different tense/aspect marking. In (1a) and (1b) the verbs j-wabw-an ‘cook’ and
j-wam-an ‘know’ are habitual. The verbs j-wabw-an ‘cook’ and j-otebem ‘sit’ are present
progressive in (1c-d). The verb j-wabw-an ‘cook’ and j-achemb ‘call’ are past in (1e-f). In some
of the examples (1a, 1b, 1c, and 1e), the first person singular pronoun ats̈ is used, but it is not
obligatory (and not included in 1d or 1f), because the prefix së- shows that the subject of the verb
is first person singular.(1a)       Kadaté ats̈ sëndwabwán wameshnen.

8.3.1   VPs consisting entirely of a single verb
        A verb phrase can consist of just a verb (without any other constituents) as seen in (20a),
where the verb jwenatjëmban ‘disappear’ is marked for person, number, and TAM. The prefix
tën- ‘3SG’ indexes the third person singular subject washëntsayá ‘sower’. There is no object,
oblique, adverb, or postposition within the VP. In (20a), the verb phrase contains nothing but a
verb, and the object of the verb that is not present as a full noun is indicated by a cross-
referencing prefix on the verb (k- ‘2SG)’. The prefix b- (which follows the object marker) indexes
a first person singular subject; and the prefix at- marks the mood of the verb as irrealis.(20a) Ndayek tënjwenatjëmba ch washëntsayá?
      ndayek        tën-j-wenatjëmba            ch             washëntsayá

        Verb phrases can have expressed direct objects. As there is no case marking on any
nominals (including pronouns) to indicate their role as subject or (direct) object in Kamsá, there
is no morphological difference between subjects and objects. Also, because the word order in
Kamsá is very free, it is generally not possible to use word order to discern which NP is the
subject and which is the object in a transitive clause. In (21), there is no expressed subject; the
NP mongoj ‘deer’ is the direct object of the verb. There is no extra morphology on mongoj to
indicate what its role in the sentence is.","[216, 217]"

2.2.1.4 Arguments against the high central vowel as a phoneme
          An alternative analysis is that ɨ is not phonemic, but instead is either an epenthetic vowel
(to break up consonant clusters) or a reduced form of an underlyingly different vowel.
Sometimes (and especially between nasals), it is not clear whether [ɨ] is present in the word at all
(even phonetically). Thus [mɨnte] ‘today’ could also be realized as [mnte], that is, with a syllabic
nasal and [ɨndɨmɨn] ‘he/she’it is’ could also be [ndmn], [ndɨmɨn] or other various combinations
of having the high central vowel and not having it.
          Although there are arguments against ɨ being phonemic, I claim here that it is a phoneme
because of the few minimal pairs and because speakers distinguish between it and other sounds.",[52]

       One interesting phenomenon in the Kamsa language is that when a verb is ditransitive,
the pronominal agreement morpheme that is attached to the verb indexes the goal. In (37), the
goal is first singular and is shown on the verb with s̈o-. Furthermore, the first person pronoun ats̈
is in the sentence with no marking.(37)   ats̈ s̈o-n-jakwenta tonjapasaibs kanÿe kwent tayta mandat.

sometimes a Kamsá word and a word of Spanish origin. Several adverbs are formed from a
Kamsá word and té ‘day’, (presumably from Spanish dia ‘day’) which is a stressed clitic,
attaching to other words; the stress is always on te. For example, mnte ‘today’ is formed from the
Kamsá demonstrative mwa and té, ‘day’. Similarly, kadaté ‘every day’ and kanÿeté ‘one day’ are
formed with kada from Spanish cada ‘each’ and te, and Kamsá kanÿe ‘one’ and te. Some
adverbs are formed from the intensifier kach, including kachiñ ‘again’ kachës ‘early’ and kachor
‘instantly’ (presumably from Spanish ahora ‘now’). One interesting composite is tonjapasaibs
‘yesterday’ formed with the Kamsá word ibs ‘tomorrow’, tonja ‘he/she went’, and pasa from
Spanish pasar ‘to spend, pass’14. Some common adverbs are loan words from Spanish, such as
mor ‘now’ from Spanish ahora ‘now’ and ya ‘already’ from Spanish ya. This chart does not
include all temporal adverbs in the language.
         Sentences (1a-i) show adverbs. In all of the sentences, except (1k), (1i) and (1m), the
adverb is the first element in the clause. In (1a) kachiñ ‘again’ is at the beginning of the clause.
In (1b) mor means ‘now’. In (1c) ibs ‘tomorrow’ is at the beginning of the clause, and the verb
has the future tense. Similarly in (1d) the clause begins with tonjapasaibs ‘yesterday’ for past
tense. In (1e) and (1f) the clauses start with kanÿna ‘once’ and kanÿe te ‘one day’, respectively.
In (1g) the clause starts with kadate ‘each day’. In (1h), the clause (and the story) begins with
anteo ‘long ago’. In (1i) natsan ‘before’ goes at the beginning of the NP, meaning something like
‘the gold-before-knower’, i.e. the one who knew first where the gold was. Some of these words
can also be used adverbially as seen in the following two examples with natsan ‘before’. In (1j),

  The etymology of tonjapasaibs is strange, because one would expect it to mean ‘day after tomorrow’ rather than
‘yesterday’.","[173, 174]"

        In (7a) waben ‘sister’ is not marked, nor is tobias̈ ‘girl’ in (7b). Note that in (7a) the Goal
is at the end of the sentence whereas in (7b) the Theme tsjan ‘guinea pig’ is the last element in
the cause. Sometimes, however, the Goal has an allative marker as seen in (7c) with boya ‘man’.
Perhaps the allative has a different semantic connotation.(7a)    tonjopasaibs ch bata tbojeyam kanÿe twamb ats̈be waben

pronoun appears in the clause, which is optional, it does not have any special marking. In (8a),
the verb j-akwenta ‘tell’ is marked with s̈o-, the first person object marker. (8b) is repeated from
above to show comparison with j-achemb ‘call’ marked with s̈o- to agree with the object. In both

       Negation is shown by the negator word ndoñ, negative indefinite pronouns, and/or verbal
morphology. The language does not allow double negatives, meaning that either the negator
word ndoñ is used or a negative indefinite pronoun, but never both at the same time. The
language can have, however, negative verbal morphology and the negator ndoñ in the same
clause. When the verb is negative, the negator ndoñ is usually there but sometimes negation can
be shown by verbal morphology without the negator. Similarly, although the verb usually has
negative morphology, sometimes negation can be shown with ndoñ without any special
morphology on the verb. The verbal morphology of negation is discussed in 4.9. Here I discuss
the syntax of such constructions.","[233, 234]"

          The word nÿe is extremely common. It has three uses. It can be used in parallel
structures; it can be used alone to mean ‘only’; and it can strengthen words/phrases.
          In (29a-c), nÿe is used to create parallel structures. In (29a) the first clause has the
subordinator =as and has a concessive meaning, and the second clause has the conjunction pero
‘but’. In (29b), nÿe is used to convey ‘not only, but also…’; the first clause has an inflected verb
jamnan ‘be’ while the second clause has an uninflected verb marked with the benefactive clitic
=am. Also note that jamnan ‘be’ in the first clause has the emphatic marker kwa-. In (29c) nÿe is
                                                    180
used twice to create parallel structures within a single clause, first before a list of nouns and then
before lempe ‘all’.(29a) nÿe botaman labran bobach kondbomnas

once, unlike the examples in (29) where it is used twice to create parallel structures. Even when
it is only used once, nÿe shows a contrast. In (30a) nÿe modifies ‘three days’, to contrast with
another person (who stayed in hell for longer than three days). In (30b) nÿe modifies
shloftŝëngbe mëntŝen ‘meat of birds’ to mean it is the only thing that he eats. In (30c) nÿe
modifies uta shloftsë to mean ‘only two birds’, i.e. he didn’t hunt more than two birds. As in the
example above where nÿe is used twice to create parallel structures, when it is used only once it
creates a contrast. In (30d) nÿe is used with the verb phrase ‘start to follow’.(30a) Kanÿe yents̈á bojadesmaya chnungwan te parej ibetak.

                                                 34
2.2.1.1 Distribution of /u, e, o, a/
       The four vowels that are definitely distinct phonemes in Kamsá are /u/, /e/, /o/, and /a/.
Because most Kamsá words are rather long, there are few true minimal pairs in the language.
There are, however, a number of near minimal pairs, showing the distribution of these four
vowels. The following examples illustrate that different vowels can occur in identical
environments.u and e:
xunatsan ‘carry multiple things’       xenabajan ‘come, multiple people’Both vowels can occur in the first (unstressed) syllable, between a voiceless velar fricative x and
an alveolar nasal n.u and o:
xutsnaʃa ‘bed’                         xotsbanan ‘get up’Both vowels can occur in the first (unstressed) syllable, between a voiceless velar fricative x and
a voiceless alveolar affricate ts.u and a:
kukwatʂ ‘hand’                         kakan ‘raw’Both vowels can occur in a stressed first syllable, between two voiceless velar stops k. Some
more examples are:tʃumbo ‘turkey’                        tʃam ‘for this’
xuʃaɲ ‘crack, crevice’                 xaʃnan ‘apply medicine’e and o:
xenoboten ‘get bigger’                 xonanan ‘feel’Both vowels can occur between a voiceless velar fricative x and an alveolar nasal n.e and a:
nde (response to a greeting)           nda ‘who’
Both can occur in open syllables, following a prenasalized alveolar stop nd.o and a:
obona ‘fat’                            obana ‘dead’                                                   35
Both vowels can occur the second (stressed) syllable, between a voiced bilabial stop b and an
alveolar nasal n.
         All four of these vowels can occur between two consonants (specifically stops), as seen
below.u: kukwatʂ ‘hand’
e: bekon ‘close’
o: bokoj ‘chicha (a fermented beverage)’
a: bata ‘aunt’All four of the vowels can be word initial, as seen below.u: uta ‘two’
e: enuta ‘friend’
o: obana ‘dead’
a: ak ‘you (singular)’Only three of the four vowels (/e, o, a/) can occur word finally, however, as seen below. There is
no attested form ending in *u#.e: maʃakbe ‘lulo fruit’
o: tʃumbo ‘turkey’
a: moka ‘here’2.2.1.2 The high front vowel [i]
         The status of the high front vowel i is less clear. It seems to be an allophone of /e/, as the
two phones are in complementary distribution. The form [i] is only found preceding palatal (or
palatal-alveolar) consonants (/ʃ, ⁿdʒ, tʃ, ɲ, j, ʎ/), whereas [e] never precedes a palatal (or palatal-
alveolar) consonant, as illustrated by the following:(1a)     empas ‘finished’
(1b)     ena ‘pure’
(1c)     iⁿdʒa ‘other’ (i preceding a prenasalized voiced palato-alveolar affricate)
(1d)     iɲe ‘fire’ (i preceding a palatal nasal)
(1e)     itʃan- [future prefix] (i preceding a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate)Thus, the following phonological process could be posited:e → i / _ palatal
                                                   36
/i/ before palatal glides
/i/ is also inserted before the glide /j/, just as /u/ can occur before /w/.
Ø → i / _ glide        There are, however, a few places where i occurs that are not predictable, running counter
to the posited palatal rule above (i.e., a limited number of lexemes exhibit [i] preceding non-
palatal consonants). First, there are three words (likely etymologically related) that contain the
form [ib] (all three of these words have something to do with time): ibeta ‘night’, ibs
‘tomorrow’, and tonxapasaibs ‘yesterday’. Note that tonxapasaibs contains the Spanish-derived
element pasa (from pasar ‘spend time’).
        A second exceptional [i] is found in the verbal prefix is-, which designates movement
‘from a place’. The following three verbs exemplify this derivational prefix.xiseboknan ‘leave from’
xisoᵑɡwefxwan ‘fly from’
xisetsxwan ‘go up frome’        The third exception is the third person singular present marker i-, as seen below.i-n-ts-abwana ‘he/she is cooking’        There is a fourth possible exception to the rule of [i] only being found preceding palatal
consonants, as there appears to be a noun class marker of the form -i (3.2.4). Nouns represented
by this class and the adjectives that agree with them all end in [-i]. This final high front vowel
could, however, underlyingly be the palatal glide /j/, which becomes syllabic when occurring
word-finally and following a consonant, as shown below:j→i/C_#The following sentences illustrate this form as it follows the consonants x and t.(2)     tʃ bjaxi bjen fwerti ɨndemɨn

no <c> or <q>
        To simplify the orthography, I use <k> for all voiceless velar stops. I do not use <c> in
the orthography except as part of the digraph <ch> for the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /tʃ/.
Some authors have used <c> (at least in some lexemes) for the voiceless velar stop, presumably
based on English usage. Thus Howard (1967) wrote the name of the language as “Camsa”. .
Some authors have used <qu> for some Kamsá words to transcribe the velar stop while using
<k> for transcribing the same sound elsewhere. I do not use <q> at all in my orthography.
<s̈> for retroflex
        The retroflex has been written with a variety of symbols. One problem with using <s̈> is
that it could be confused with /ʃ/ or other sounds. The alternatives, however, seem more
complicated. No one in the community uses IPA <ʂ>, and some researchers have used <x> for
the retroflex, which could be confused with other sounds.

        There is perhaps a phoneme /ʎ/, the palatal lateral approximant as discussed in 2.2.2.7.
The sound is extremely rare, but there are a few words where it exists, such as mallajt (IPA
maʎaxta) ‘many’. I use <ll> for this sound because every Kamsá speaker also speaks Spanish,
where the sound [ʎ] is written <ll> and it is easier than using the IPA [ʎ].
<nd> for /nd/
        I use <nd> instead of <d> for /nd/ for two reasons. First, I want to show the
prenasalization in the orthography. Second, I want to be able to distinguish between older loan
words that were borrowed as / nd/ from Spanish /d/ and newer ones that are borrowed as /d/.","[65, 66]"

      ‘He is not even a human being.’ (McDowell)4.9     Negation
        Negation in Kamsá is shown by the negator word ndoñ preceding the verb. Usually, when
a verb is negated it has the irrealis prefix ke- and the negative prefix at-. The ke- comes before
person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and evidential marking, while the at- come after all of
those markers, closer to the verb root. Neither morpheme is obligatory, however, and it is
possible simply to have the negator word ndoñ without the irrealis prefix or the negative prefix.
Furthermore, in some tenses, such as distant past, a different negative prefix is used, namely n-
or nd-, both of which are homophonous with other prefixes in the language, i.e. evidential
marker and present habitual, respectively.
4.9.1   ndoñ with ke- and at-
        A common way to negate verbs is to use the irrealis marker ke- which comes at the
beginning of the word, preceding the subject marker, and at- which comes closer to the root,
after the aspect markers. In (60a), the j-amn-an ‘be’ is negated with ndoñ and the verb has both
prefixes ke- and at-. In (60b-c) j-amënts̈na ‘be tired’ is shown with and without the negative
marking. In (60b) and (60c) the verb has an agreement marker s̈- for first person agreement. In
(60c) the first person agreement marker s̈- comes after ke- and before at-. In (60d-e) j-apten ‘to
rain’ is shown with and without negative marking. In (60e) the evidential marker n- comes
between ki- and at-. It is phonetically ki- not ke-. (60f) shows j-abowenynan ‘remember’ with

9.3.1   Negator words ndoñ and tonday in predicative constructions
        There are two negator words in Kamsa. The negator word in Kamsa is ndoñ and it can
negate any word class and tonday means ‘there isn’t’ and negates nouns. In the following
examples, there is no verb. In predicative constructions, a copula is not necessary. In (9a) ndoñ
negates the adjective ts̈aba ‘good’ and in (9b) it negates mas ‘more’. Neither clause has a verb.
In (9c) and (9d) tonday ‘there is not’ is used, to show the nonexistence of shloftsts̈unga ‘birds’
and begong ‘fish’.(9a)    ch bayujeman ndoñe ts̈abaka

        The following two examples provide a review of the negative verbal morphology
discussed in 4.9. The verb j-obenan ‘be able to’ appears in the first person singular present. In
(10a), the verb has no extra morphology. In (10b) ndoñ precedes the verb, and the verb has both
the prefix ke- and the additional prefix at- closer to the verb stem.","[234, 235]"

        Postpositional phrases in Kamsá consist of a noun followed by a postposition. Often case
markers are also present: case markers can occur on the postposition itself, on the noun, or on
both the postposition and the noun. In (34a), the postposition tsëntsa ‘middle’ follows the noun
tsa ‘room’ and tsëntsa has the locative marker -k. Similarly, in (34b) tsëntsa has the case marker
                                               210
-k and the NP preceding it, chëng ‘3PL’, has the genitive marker -be. In (34c) the third person
singular pronoun cha has the genitive marker -be when it precedes bekonan ‘close’. An
alternative analysis is that these are not postpositions, but rather nouns. In (34d) the tsëntsak is
used nominally without any other noun (i.e. just ‘in the middle’ not ‘in the middle of the room’).
Another analysis is that these are compound nouns, not postpositions.(34a) wabowan bëtsëkna tsa tsëntsak jakena
      wabowan         bëtsëk-na      tsa     tsëntsa-k      jakena

      ‘(arriving) at the middle, it begin to get bright.’ (Chindoy 70:14)8.5    Prepositional phrases
       Although Kamsá normally employs postpositions, it has borrowed some prepositions
from Spanish. There are no native prepositions in the language (only postpositions), but the
Spanish prepositions are very common now. In (35a), the preposition sin ‘without’ (from
Spanish sin ‘without’) precedes the noun tamo ‘salt’. Nouns governed by the loan preposition sin
take the instrumental case marker -k, as does tamo ‘salt’ below. If the preposition sin were not
present in this sentence, then the phrase would mean ‘with salt’, as illustrated in (35b).
       It is interesting to note that the language has postpositions, and that all subordinators go
at the end of clauses, such as the general subordinator -as and ora ‘when’, but that it has started
borrowing prepositions, and subordinators that go at the beginning of clauses (like ante ‘before’),
so now you can have a mix of things going at the end of phrases and clauses and at the beginning
                                                 211
of verbs and clauses. Furthermore, it is possible that adpositions and subordinators borrowed
from Spanish earlier (maybe several centuries ago) became postpositions or clause final
subordinators, such as ora ‘when’ from Spanish hora ‘time, hour’, whereas recent borrowings
became prepositions or clause initial subordinators.(35a) nÿe s̈men janÿets̈na sin tamok
      nÿe     s̈men          janÿets̈na      [sin          tamo-k]
      only toasted.corn corn.flour           [without      salt-INS]
      ‘only toasted corn flour without salt’ (Chindoy 62:17)(35b) wameshnen tamok
      wameshnen [tamo=k]
      mote         [salt=INS]
      ‘mote (hominy soup) with salt’       In (36a) another common preposition. asta ‘until’ (from Spanish hasta ‘until’), precedes
bastok ‘Pasto (a city near Sibundoy)’. This preposition can have a noun or an infinitive object;
when it takes an infinitive, it is always an uninflected. In (36a) asta bastok means ‘until Pasto’. It
is unclear whether there is case marking on bastok because, like many place names, the
unmarked form is already locative (such as bogotok ‘Bogotá’; tabanok ‘Sibundoy’ and chatjok
‘Mocoa’). In (36b) asta ‘until’ is the preposition and the infinitive belongs to the prepositional
phrase. The verb jwenatjëmb ‘disappear’ is not inflected for person, number, or TAM. In (36c)
asta precedes shachna ‘five’, which is used substantively and has the plural marker -ëng.(36a) ch benach indëmën chatjokan asta bastok.

                                                 212
       Another preposition, also derived from Spanish, is parej ‘together with’ presumably from
parejo ‘similar, equal, close, next to’. It is interesting because its meaning has shifted from the
Spanish meaning mostly as an adjective to become a preposition. Its noun has a case marker:
commitative for animate nouns and instrumental for inanimate nouns. In (37a) parej
enuntëngaftaka means ‘together with (her) friends’ where enuntëng ‘friends’ has the comitative
marker -aftak. In (37b) parej twambianak means ‘together with that of the hen’ (meaning the
brother discarded the chili along with the piece of hen). Note that in (37b) the noun has the
ablative marker to show source; it does not have -bi even though it’s an animal (and living
animals are animate) because in this sense it is food; and it does not show any object marking.(37a) nÿe s̈ës̈etem jtsabmuchtkoyám parej enuntëngaftaka.

                             Simple clauses (monoclausal sentences)
9.1     Introduction
        In this chapter, I provide an overview of clause-level syntax in Kamsá, a clause being
minimally a verb and a subject (expressed or not expressed). Because verbs are marked for
person and number, a noun or pronoun is not obligatory, thus a clause could be simply a verb.
First I discuss clauses (9.2) including intransitive (9.2.1), predicative (9.2.2), then transitive
clauses (9.2.3) and clauses with complements (9.2.4). In (9.2.5) I discuss clauses with obliques
and in (9.2.6) I discuss ditransitive clauses. In (9.3) I discuss negation and in (9.4) I discuss
comparatives and superlatives. (9.5) covers imperatives and (9.6) describes interrogatives.
        Indexing on the verb clearly shows that the system is nominative-accusative: subjects of
transitive verbs have the same morphemes as subjects of intransitives, both contrasting with the
marking of objects of transitives. NPs and personal pronouns are not marked in any way for
Agent or Patient (see 3.3.3 on noun cases). As seen in the following examples, although the
nouns and pronouns do not have any morphology for case, the verbal morphology is
nominative/accusative.(1a)    ch bobonts tonjachemb tobias̈

      ‘You (plural) are crying out for corn.’ (Chindoy 2 73:2)It is important to note that s̈mo- is confusingly the same morpheme as the composite for a first

        Third person plural subjects are indexed on verbs by the plural prefix mo-. Each of the

‘little birds’, is overt in the clause, whereas in (13b) and (13c), the subjects are not expressed, but

        There is no specific verbal marker to indicate first person dual subjects. That is, no prefix
encodes both first person and dual number. First person dual subjects can be indexed with the
dual marker bo-, the first person marker së-, and bsë-. It is possible that such subjects can
alternatively be marked with the plural marker mo-, but I do not have examples of mo- marking
first person dual in my data.
        In (14a), the verb j-wabw-an ‘cook’ is marked with the dual marker bo-, agreeing with
the first dual pronoun bëndat in the same clause. In (14b), the two verbs jashjango ‘arrive’ and
jatay ‘spend the night’ are marked with the dual marker bo-. Here, there is no overt subject, but
the subject is understood to be first person (dual) since the sentence belongs to a text in which a
man is planning with his brother. In (14c), the verb jan ‘go’ is marked with së-, the first person

        Second person dual has the marker s̈o-, but it can also be indexed with the dual marker
bo-. It is possible that such subjects can alternatively be marked with the plural marker mo- or
the second person plural marker s̈mo- but I do not have examples of these in my corpus. In (15a),
both verbs are marked with s̈o- to agree with the second person dual subject pronoun tsëndat.
Also in (15b) the verb j-aman ‘sleep’ is marked with s̈o- to agree with tsëndat, whereas in (15c)
the verb is marked simply with the dual marker bo-, which does not index person. Note that in
(15a) the verb also has a dual suffix -at in addition to the second person dual prefix.(15a) Tsëndata kats̈ata s̈ondmëna,

with first person object. It seems that this is homophony rather than being the same prefix. In
(16) j-apegan ‘hit’ has the prefix s̈o- to index a third person singular subject basetem ‘boy’ and
first person singular object ats̈ ‘I, me’. Object marking is discussed in 4.3.","[110, 111, 112, 113]"
"
4.4.3 Past, completed: t-
       As discussed in 4.2, the third person singular is marked with t- in the past. Thus, to-
marks both third person singular and past. In (45a-b) the verb j-an ‘go’ is shown with different
person and number prefixes to contrast with to-. In (45a) the third person is marked with to-,
which is contrasted with the first person singular së- in (45b) and the second person singular ko-
in (45c). In (45d) the third person singular is marked i- in the future, showing that third person
singular isn’t marked with t- in other tenses.(45a) Tonjapasaibs tobias̈ tonja tabanoy.

morphemes for completed actions. In the following example, t- precedes the second person
object marker k- and the first person subject marker bo-.(46)   tonjapasaibs ats̈       t-k-bo-n-jakwenta kanÿe istoria

       Irrealis is marked by the prefix ke-. It can be used in conditional clauses with ora or orna
‘when’, which comes from Spanish ahora ‘now’. In these subordinate clauses ora is clause final.
In (47a), the verb has the ke- prefix for irrealis, then the second person object marker followed
by the third person plural subject marker. The clause ends with orna. Similarly in (47b), the verb
j-amn-an ‘to be’ has the irrealis prefix at the beginning, and the clause ends with ora.(47a) ndayents̈ kekmonjinÿe orna kmochantsepochoka

       It is interesting to note that there is a contrast between singular, plural, and dual first
person and no contrast between inclusive and exclusive plural first person, a common feature of
many languages in the area.
       Additionally, there are optional suffixes that show that the subject of a verb is plural or
dual (-ang and -at, respectively). Although these suffixes can co-occur with number marking
prefixes, they are often used when the number marking prefixes are not present.
       The following sentences show verbs marked with the first person plural prefix bs- (often
pronounced [fs-], perhaps because of different dialects or free variation). In (9a), the verb
jamnan ‘be’ is marked with the prefix bsë-, without any overt (pronominal) subject included in
the clause. In (9b), on the other hand, the first person plural pronoun bëng is present in the
clause, and the verb jets̈an ‘lose’ is marked with bsë- to agree with it. Similarly, in (9c), japasar
‘pass, be’ is marked with bsë-, indexing the first person plural pronoun bëng.(9a)   Bsëndanmën bëts tabanok.

2.2.2.1 Voiceless stops /t, k/
        Kamsá has two voiceless stops, /t/ and /k/, which contrast with each other. They can
occur word initially before /a/ or before /o/, as seen below, as well as in other environments.katʃ [intensifier]               tamo ‘salt’
kotʃaʂ ‘chest’                   tobiaʂ ‘girl’        Both /t/ and /k/ can be word final, as seen below.bakoftak ‘with the uncle’        katʂat ‘brother’2.2.2.2 Voiced stops /b, ⁿd, /ᵑɡ/
        The voiced stops are /b/, /ⁿd/, and /ᵑɡ/. Whereas the alveolar and velar voiced stops are
prenasalized, the bilabial voiced stop is not. The prenasalized stops /ⁿd/ and /ᵑɡ/ contrast with
each other, as seen in the following words.ⁿdmwa ‘who’                      ᵑɡmenan ‘pity’
ⁿdwawenan [deaf]                 ᵑɡwɨʂɨʂbe ‘nose’
The (non-prenasalized) voiced bilabial stop /b/ also contrasts with the two other voiced stops, ⁿd
and ᵑɡ, as seen below.bokoj ‘chicha’                   ⁿdoka ‘nothing’
baja ‘animal, beast’             ⁿdajek ‘why?’bwetʃtsanuko ‘hat’               ᵑɡwetʃe ‘mud’

       As mentioned, the voiced bilabial stop /b/ exhibits the allophones [b], [p], and [f]. As
discussed in Section (2.5) below, [p] is becoming (or has become) a phoneme as well, due to
loan words in the language.
       The allophone [f] occurs when /b/ followed by a voiceless consonant, i.e.:/b/ → [f ] / [-voice] (optional?)       The form [b] is always found when followed by a vowel or the labial-velar approximant
/w/, as in basa ‘small’ or bwatʃana ‘visitor’ (i.e., never *fasa or *fwatʃana). It is only a
following voiceless consonant that can condition the change of /b/ to [f], as in the word fʃants
‘land’ and fxants ‘white’, in which the following voiceless fricative conditions the [f]. Voiceless
stops also condition b → f, as seen in the word ften ‘bland’.
       For at least some words, however, there may be free variation—for example, the word
[ftʃend] ‘blue’ can also be pronounced [btʃe nd].","[55, 56]"

examples are ndoká ‘nothing’ and ndokena ‘no one’. In (13a) ndoká ‘nothing’ is used with the
verb jayan which is marked with n- to show that it is negative, meaning ‘saying nothing’. In
(13b) it is used with nÿa for emphasis in the command. In (13c) the verb j-amnan ‘to be’ has
negative morphology. In (13d) ndokna ‘no one’ shows that there was nothing left of two images.
It has the dual marker -ta because it is of the two images and it isn’t clear why it is ndokna ‘no
one’ instead of ndoká ‘nothing’.","[235, 236, 237]"

up to two consonants in the onset and up to two consonants in the coda. Alternatively, the
nucleus can be a consonant, but if there are more than two consonants in a syllable, an epenthetic
high central vowel /ɨ/ is inserted.
        The following words exhibit syllables containing onsets consisting of a single consonant:betsko ‘fast’
kanta ‘four’
maʃakbe ‘lulo fruit’
sasna ‘food’
ʃaxwan ‘bean’
tabanok ‘village’
wabon ‘spirit’
xan ‘go’        The following word contains syllables with two consonants in a single onset.stonoj ‘behind’        Vowel initial words in Kamsa are rare, but are possible, as seen by the following words.atʂ ‘I’
enutá ‘friend’
obaná ‘dead’
uta ‘two’2.4     Stress
        Kamsá words generally have penultimate stress, although there are a few cases where
stress is ultimate. Thus, stress is phonemic, not fully predictable. Stress cannot fall on syllables
other than the penult or ultima.
        Some words have lexically determined ultimate stress. This is particularly common for
nouns ending in /-a/, such as wabowán ‘horrible’ and batá ‘aunt’. There is a tendency for nouns
that end in an open syllable with /a/ or /o/ or a closed syllable with /an/ to have ultimate stress,
but it is not always the case.
        Stress is usually penultimate, but it can be ultimate as well. For ultimate stress, only
syllables with /a/, /o/, or /e/ as the nucleus can take stress. In the following examples, /a/, /o/, and
                                                   46
/e/ are in the final syllable and have stress. /i/, /u/, and /ɨ/ never have stress in the ultimate
syllable.batá ‘aunt’
bakó ‘uncle’
ʃaxbé ‘cucumber’Words that end with closed syllables have penultimate stress.bastok ‘Pasto’
benach ‘path’        The high back vowel /u/ can be stressed when occurring in the penult of a word with
default penultimate stress, but there are no Kamsá words with /u/ in the last syllable.
        While ultimate stress can be lexically determined, it can be morphologically determined
as well: verbs have ultimate stress in the infinitive, as in the following examples (note that the
infinitive always ends in -an).xaxanán ‘to say’
xwaʃɨntsán ‘to plant corn’        Although this ultimate stress appears to be morphologically conditioned, it could instead
be that there is something (phonological) about final -an that attracts stress. Indeed, there are
words belonging to other classes that end in -an, which also have ultimate stress, such as
wabowán ‘horrible’.
        Although there are not many minimal pairs in Kamsá (in part because words tend to be
quite long), there is at least one minimal pair in the language based on stress alone: whereas the
word ena ‘pure’ has penultimate stress, the word ená ‘seller’ has ultimate stress.
        Some clitics always take the stress, namely the clitic te ‘day’, as in kada-té ‘each day’
2.5     Loan phonology
        Due to the influence of Spanish, Kamsá has acquired several (relatively) new phonemes,
which speakers recognize as different sounds. These occur only in loanwords. Words with stops
are now being borrowed with the stop /d/ or /g/ instead of with the prenasalized equivalent. /r/
and /ʎ/ are also common and found only in loan words (from Spanish or Inga). Finally [p] (which
                                                    47
also occur in Kamsá as an allophone of /b/) is recognized by speakers as phonemically distinct
when occurring in loanwords, and so could be considered a fifth loan phoneme.","[58, 59, 60, 61]"

        Some community members have noticed that the language is not being passed on to
children, and they have various reactions to this, ranging from desire to take action to feeling that
no action is necessary, since the children will still somehow have the language because it is “in
their blood”, to feeling futility, that the language will be lost no matter what, since children are
concerned more with popular music than with the language of their elders. Many people,
however, have not noticed how dire the situation is, perhaps in part because many children do
indeed know the basic greetings and some vocabulary, and so can often come across as more
engaged with the language than they actually are. Él/ella) entiende ‘(s)he understands’ is a
common thing said about members of the younger generation.","[34, 35]"

1.2.4   Borrowing
        Kamsá has a long tradition of lexical borrowed from both Spanish and Inga. More
recently, as the language has come to be spoken less and less, it has become more and more
influenced by Spanish, both lexically and syntactically. This section focuses more on the older
borrowings, especially those forms that have been fully integrated into Kamsá phonotactics or
have undergone sound changes that have somewhat obscured their non-Kamsá etymologies. The
words considered in this section are—largely—considered by native speakers to be “Kamsá”
(regardless of their origins) and they are used commonly in traditional stories, ceremonial
speech, and other speech registers that may be considered “pure” or “traditional”. Thus, these
are—both etically (on the grounds of phonotactics and morphology) and emically (on the
grounds of speaker identification of Kamsá-ness)—fully integrated loanwords as opposed to
instances of code-switching or language loss.
        One obvious semantic domain for borrowing includes vocabulary for fauna, flora,
cultural objects and concepts that did not exist before the arrival of the Spanish. Examples
include: ral ‘money’ (from Spanish real, the old Spanish currency), naranjabe ‘orange’ (from
Spanish naranja ‘orange’), and jatrabaja ‘work’ (from Spanish trabajar ‘work’). All three of
these words exhibit the borrowed phoneme /r/, which suggests that the forms are foreign.
Nevertheless, their integration into Kamsá can be shown both phonologically and
morphologically. First, ral ‘money’ has undergone a phonological reduction, from the disyllabic                                                  12
form re.al to the current monosyllabic ral (the fact that the term real is no longer used in local
Colombian Spanish can obscure the word’s etymology). Second, the from naranjabe ‘orange’
shows a morphological change, having received the noun classifier associated with round
objects, -be (3.2.2). Finally, jatrabaja has undergone the phonological change of the loss of a
final consonant; furthermore, it reveals Kamsá verbal morphology by exhibiting the non-finite
verb marker j(a)- (4), as well as being able to receive TAM morphology.
       Almost all conjunctions (10.2) in Kamsá are borrowed from Spanish, including: o ‘or’
(from Spanish o); i ‘and’ (from Spanish y); pero ‘but’ (from Spanish pero); porke ‘because’
(from Spanish porque); maske ‘although’ (from Spanish más que ‘more than’); and ni ‘neither,
nor’ (from Spanish ni). Other borrowed basic function-like words include mas ‘more’ (from
Spanish más); mejor ‘better’ (from Spanish mejor); and peor ‘bad’ (from Spanish peor ‘worse’).
These are all discussed in 10.2 and 9.4.
       Because the Catholic missionaries were the only people speaking Spanish in Sibundoy
until the 1950s (Fabre 2001:2), much of the older Spanish vocabulary that has been borrowed
into Kamsá reflects the varieties of Spanish used by the them. Fabre states: “This explains why
the Spanish layer we can detect in Kamsá and Inga is so replete with quaintly old-fashioned
church Spanish” (Fabre 2001:2). Some examples are the following: parla ‘speak’ (from parlar, a
now obsolete Spanish word for ‘speak’, cf. standard hablar); ndeombre ‘truly’ (from Spanish de
hombre loosely, ‘by my word’); andela warda ‘God protect you’ (from Spanish dios le guarde,
‘God preserve you’), dioslepay ‘thank you’ (from (que) dios le pague ‘may God pay you’, cf.
standard gracias).
       Along with vocabulary, Kamsá has borrowed some phonology from Spanish as well
(2.2.2.7). The most obvious loan phoneme is /r/, some examples of which were seen above.
Other examples include rat ‘bit, while’ (from Spanish rato ‘while’) and mor ‘now’ (from
Spanish ahora ‘now’ or, alternatively, from *mwa-hora ‘this hour’, from Kamsá mwa ‘that’ plus
Spanish hora ‘hour’).
       Kamsá’s traditional phoneme inventory also lacked a plain (non-prenasalized) voiced
alveolar /d/, and many older Spanish words that contained /d/ have been borrowed into Kamsá
with either /nd/ or /ndʒ/ (written in orthography used here as <nd> and <nÿ>, respectively).
Examples of Spanish words with *d that have been borrowed with phonological changes into
                                                 13
Kamsá are: nÿios or ndios or nÿios̈ ‘god’ (from Spanish dios ‘god’); ndeolpe ‘suddenly’ from de
golpe ‘suddenly’; and nderado ‘maybe’ possibly from *de raro.
       Many words borrowed from Spanish have changed in meaning, sometimes even
functioning as different parts of speech in Kamsá than in Spanish. Loanwords are pointed out
throughout the dissertation as well as their change in meaning and/or part of speech. Two brief
examples of loanwords that have taken on new meaning in Kamsá are ora ‘when’ and parej
‘with’. First, ora ‘when’ comes from the Spanish nouns hora ‘hour, time, when’, but has become
a subordinator for temporal clauses, thus shifting both in meaning and in function (10.3.3).
Similarly, parej ‘with’ from the Spanish adjective parejo ‘equal to, level with, similar to’
functions in Kamsá as a preposition, not as a adjective.
       Many Spanish words have found new meanings in ceremonial speech, the register of
Kamsá that is used for many formal situations, such as greetings in the cabildo, and for Catholic
sacraments, such as baptisms and confirmations. Haydee Seijas (1969:65), who conducted
anthropological fieldwork in Sibundoy in the 1960s, refers to this type of speech as the lengua de
los antiguos or “relación speech”. She reports that most people are not fluent in this speech,
which consists of set words and phrases and are used by the governor in his Sunday address to
the Kamsá people and by others as a means of showing politeness. The following example, the
beginning of a formal greeting, shows the Spanish influence, with three out of the four words
coming from Spanish (the possessive pronoun ats̈be ‘my’ is the only fully native Kamsá word).
The verb, although derived from Spanish, exhibits Kamsá verbal morphology:(1)    Primermente ats̈be dios chas̈pasentsia …
       primermente ats̈-be            dios cha-s̈-pasentsia
       first             1SG-GEN      god    COND-1SG-forgive
       ‘First may god forgive me…’ (Chindoy 28:5) (primermente from Spanish primeramente
       ‘firstly’, dios from Spanish dios ‘God’, pasentsia from Spanish paciencia ‘patience’)       Much of the ‘formal’ speech relates to the Catholic church, which we might expect to
have a lot of Spanish not because it’s formal but because it involves Catholic rituals and
ceremonies, where they borrowed the words along with the rituals. There is also non-religious
formal speech that uses Spanish, such as the petitioning for a girlfriend, mentioned above.
       In addition to lexical borrowing, Kamsá has perhaps undergone structural changes under
influence from Spanish and Inga. Since Kamsá has no known relatives and since no early                                                 14
documents representing the language are known, it is impossible to say with any certainty what
structural traits (if any) are due to influence from other languages. That said, it is possible that
the basic word order in Kamsá is becoming more SVO (due to influence from Spanish), and that
there is a trend toward using fewer adjectival verbs or null-copular constructions for predicate
adjectives, with a preference instead for copula-plus-adjective constructions (as in Spanish).
Fabre (Fabre 2001:3) suggests another influence from Spanish:   the redundant use of the same classifier, even with no intervening word between them,
   strongly reminds of the Spanish number and gender agreement rules between the same two
   parts of speech and sets Kamsá apart from classifier languages of Western Amazonia, where
   classifiers are mostly used as an anaphoric device, there being no need of repeating the noun
   to which they refer.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"
