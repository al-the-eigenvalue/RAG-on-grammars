"3.12 Question words3. 12. 1 Polar question markers   Polar questions can be formed without any overt morphological marking, as long as the
intonation is rising. But generally, either of two question markers, e or i, is used. Both
question markers are utterance-final clitics. The marker i (which is homophonous, if not
identical, to the element 'yes' = i or iyo, presumably 'yes' + 0 'inclusive disjunction') seems to
be the more general, since it also occurs on content questions.
   The difference between -e and - i lies in expectations on the part of the speaker.
Informants characterised the contrast in terms of e requiring a quick answer and i marking
questions in general. When a positive -i.e. agreeing-answer is expected, -e is used, as in
examples (3. 1 47) and (3 . 1 4 8).
     (3 . 1 47)   A -ngkek   dut e?
                  2SG-skin hot Q
                  You are hot, aren't you?",[84]
"The expected answer is: [yo, di-ngkek dut 'yes, I'm hot'.     (3 . 1 48)   li-ttei    ha      hi          big     e?
                  2PL-carry bird      another not        Q
                  You didn't bring a bird, did you?
                                                                               Morphology         69Similarly, the expected answer to (3 . 1 48) is: Iyo, ni-ttei ha hi big 'Yes, we (excl.) didn't bring
a bird'. In contrast, a request, as in (3 . 1 49), does not presume a positive answer.","[84, 85]"
"
3. 12.2 Content questions    Content questions use a question word as well as the marker i. The question marker is
always present. If it follows a word with final high front vowel, the phonetic result is a long
[i:]. This same form seems to be part of the Q-word 'what' mindei, which I take to be made
up of mun 'something' + de 'POSS' + i 'Q-marker'. Thus, if mindei is utterance-final the
realisation is [m�ndeyi]:
   (3 . 1 52)    A -pim    tut       mindei-i?
                 2SG-cry   along what
                 Why are you crying?",[85]
"3. 1 1. 1 Given marker ri   The 'given marker' ri is used in a variety of contexts, but it always determines the
preceding constituent. In example (3 . 1 37), which are possible answers to the question where
something is located, it links the preceding pronoun to the following demonstrative.
      (3 . 1 37)      No       Tl    ni.
                      3SG GIV here
                      It is here (near the Speaker).",[82]
"     (3 . 1 62)      Mi-tiei     ni-mang-ti           pig    i?
                     thing-white 3SG-many-NOM how Q
                     How much does it cost? (mitiei = money)
   Finally, WHY is questioned with an expression similar to WHO, in that it uses ri no
'GIVen 3SG':
     (3 . 1 63)      Nggon ri      no       a-bi-nyen      i?
                     what    GIV 3SG 2SG-INS-just Q
                     Why are you late? (I take binyen 'late, slow' to be a compound of
                     Instrumental bi- and the adverb nyen 'just'.)
                                                                            Morphology        71   The difference between tut mindei 'why' in examples (3. 1 52) and (3 . 1 53) and nggon ri no
in (3 . 1 63) is reflected in form and clausal position. The former expresses 'reason' or
'purpose' -'for what (are you crying)?', while the latter expresses cause-'what was it that
(you are late)?' I have not seen the form nggon in other combinations, thus cannot give a
separate gloss for it.
   Notice that WHO questions, questions involving nominal predicates and this cause/reason
question all use the given marker ri, which seems to close the first constituent, as also in:
   (3 . 1 64)    A-nyeng     n     tou i?
                 2SG-name GIV who Q
                 What's your name?

                    1                         Introduction                 1.1 Background                   When the multidisciplinary program ISIR was conceived at the end of 1 992, the focus
                was on the south-west of the Bird's Head peninsula of Irian Jaya. At the same time, we
                realised that a detailed study of languages spoken in the eastern part of the Bird's Head was
                necessary if we wanted to obtain a more complete picture of the so-called West-Papuan
                phylum and other language groups in this area. One intriguing target was what was known as
                a phylum-level isolate in the eastern part of the Bird's Head: Hatam.
                   Not much was known. We knew that missionaries of TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance
                Mission) were working on a bible translation in that language, but no linguistic description
                was available. The oldest information on the language was a (very) short article by Loukotka,
                which contains a few words of the language. ' Cowan ( 1 953) does not contain any Hatam
                material. He presents some data on what he calls Mansibaber, which can be identified as
                Meyah or related Moskona, and Manikion (equated with Mantion), which can be identified
                as Sougb.
                   In Voorhoeve (1 975) and Wurm and Hattori ( 1 98 1 ) Hatam and Borai are treated as
                related languages, clearly separate from neighbouring language groups. In later publications,
                Borai has disappeared and Hatam is listed as an isolate (Voorhoeve ( 1 987a, 1 987b), Silzer
                and Heikkinen ( 1 99 1 )). In fact, Voorhoeve ( 1 9 8 7b:9 1 ) substitutes the name Tinam for
                Hatam and Silzer and Heikkinen ( 1 9 9 1 : 50) include Borai together with a number of other
                names as alternatives for Hatam.
                   Similarly, not much was known about Manikion or Mantion, Meyah or Moskona. As the
                ISIR program started in 1 99 3 we learned that members of the Summer Institute of
                Linguistics were active in Meyah (and Moskona), and that Manikion was in fact a derogatory
                term for people who call themselves Sougb. In Sougb also, TEAM missionaries were
                involved in bible translation, but no linguistic description was available.
                   Our plan, then, was to try to increase our knowledge of these languages, either through our
                own fieldwork or through material from SIL linguists. The main question was: What kind of
                language is Hatam? Related questions were: What is the status of Borai? Does it exist as a
                separate language? Is it possible to get some more information on Sougb?
                   The answer to the first question is found in this monograph, with some preliminary
                information on the related questions provided in this introduction (see § 1 .2).","[14, 15, 16, 17]"
"When the question word is fronted, the question will maintain its final marker:   (3. 1 5 3)    Tut     mindei a-pim       l' .7
                 along what       2SG-cry Q
                 What are you crying about?
  The Q-word tou is the basis for questions after 'who', 'how', 'where' and 'which'.
Questions about human identity use tou 'who', which in subject position seems t o require the
Given particle ri, as in example (3. 1 54).
   (3 . 1 54)    Tou   n      no     ngot ig           di-ni         i?
                 who GI V 3SG tie             house REL-this Q
                 Who built this house? (lit. Who is it he built this house?)   (3. 1 5 5)    Nani a-kwen      pas    mem tou-i?
                 you   2SG-cook rice     for    who-Q
                 For whom are you cooking rice?
70       Ger P. Reesink  To ask information about a particular referent out of a possible set of inanimate entities,
Hatam uses the same form tou:
     (3 . 1 56)      Nan a-de           ig    n tou-i?
                     you   2SG-POS house GIV which-Q
                     Which one is your house?
     The identity of inanimate referents is questioned with mindei:
     (3 . 1 57)      Nani a-bon        mindei-i?
                     you   2SG-make what-Q
                     What are you making?
     LOCATION (or direction) is questioned by hantou (= han 'place' + tou 'which'):
     (3 . 1 58)      Yoni i-kos      nab      ei     han-tou     i?
                     they 3PL-cut pig         LOC    place-which Q
                     Where do they cut the pig?
     If hantou is fronted, the Q-marker i remains utterance-final:
     (3 . 1 59)      Ei    han-tou        a-ttei      biei mui ug           i?
                     LOC place-which 2SG-take wood dry go                   Q
                     To where do you take the firewood?
   MANNER is questioned using tou with third person singular no preceding. It may be
positioned in either initial or final position in the clause:
     (3 . 1 60) (a) No    tou    yoni i-kim  riep i?
                    3 SG how they 3PL-tie trap Q
                    How do they make a trap?                  (b) Noni bon     ngug no      tou i?
                      he    make fence 3SG how Q
                      How does he make a fence?
   TIME and QUANTITY both use the Q-word pig. The temporal question word,
phonetically realised as [<I>i] , is followed by the conjunction api 'then' and seems to be
restricted to initial position, as in example (3 . 1 6 1 ). When quantity is questioned, the final
position is required (3 . 1 62), with the question marker immediately following, phonetically
linked by a palatal fricative [<I>icyi].
                                                                              .
     (3. 1 6 1 )     Pig  api      noni mbut        ug    ei      Branda     l .?
                     when then he         travel    go    LOC     Holland    Q
                     When will he go to Holland?","[85, 86]"
"   (3 . 1 49)    A -yai   bi-dani mem di-ngat i?
                 2SG-get to-me        for     I SG-see Q
                 Would you give it to me so I (can) see it?
  An imperative (= declarative with second person subject), as in example (3. 1 50), which
does not use the question marker, is less polite.
   (3 . 1 50)    A -yai    bi-dani mem di-ngat.
                 2SG-get to-me          for     I SG-see
                 Let me see it. (lit Give to me so I (can) see (it).)
   The contrast between e and i is found in the sequence of the questions in (3 . 1 5 1 ), directed
by the two Mandacan brothers to the Dutch sergeant Kokkelink. The first one expects that
Kokkelink will indeed answer positively, the second one is an open request.
   (3. 1 5 1 )   A-ngon    dut  nye          di  mben        Arpak      e?
                 2SG-heart warm we           REL people      Arfak      Q

                 Do you love us the Arfak people? If you do, would you allow us to hide you?",[85]
"9
     This is the only instance I have, in elicited material. Why tu had been accepted rather than corrected to su is
     not clear.
10
     Since third person singular lacks a subject prefix, the various tests and their interpretations are vacuous.
     Examples from the natural texts involving third person singular need to be confirmed for other person
     categories.
98       Ger P. Reesink   Such sequences are all necessarily same-subject, in contrast with similar sequences
interrupted by ba 'and' or lene 'then' (see §4.7. 1 ), which may have either same or different
subjects. When explicit conjunctions are employed it is clear that the sequence involves
coordination of clauses. The same observation holds for sequences interrupted by a pause, as
in example (4.97). But the question is, what is the status of sequences without connectives?
Are they asyndetically coordinated clauses? Does Hatam require an analysis positing a
special class of serial verb constructions? What happens to verbal prefixation in close verbal
sequences? What syntactic restrictions are placed on various sequences? In this preliminary
descriptive work I refrain from theoretical commitments with regard to the issue of serial
verb constructions. I have tried to gather data that seems to be relevant to the matter, and will
present that without too much interpretation.
   In order to at least partly answer these questions I will discuss morphological and syntactic
features of the following categories: (i) Directional verb sequences, (ii) Instrumental verb
sequences, (iii) Purposive verb sequences, (iv) Perception verbs + complements, and (v)
General juxtaposition. These sections are then followed by a discussion of the scope of
negation.","[113, 114]"
"
4.4.9 Position of negative   Hatam has two negatives: big 'not' for negation of declaratives and interrogatives, and au
'don't' (in Indonesian janga n) for imperatives. Both negative adverbs are always in clause­
final position. Only question particles e or i may follow.
     (4.90)     Ieni ji-ttei        hab hi        big    e?
                you    2PL-carry bird other not          Q
                You didn't bring a bird, did you?",[112]

   The Pacific Linguistics logo was
designed by Ian Scales after one
small panel of a poro batuna from
Vella La vella, held i n the
Australian Museum (A8 S 1 7). This
is an artefact made from a plaque
of fossilised giant clam shell
(Tridacna sp .), carved into an
elaborate fretwork design. These
particular artefacts were made in
the western Solomon I slands,
probably between 1 00 and 200
years ago.

          Acknowledgements    Research for this grammar was conducted in the framework of the Netherlands
Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) priority programme 'The Irian Jaya Studies: a
Programme for Interdisciplinary Research' (ISIR), financed by the Netherlands Foundation
for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO). The programme is carried out in
cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, The Indonesian Institute of
Sciences).
    I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan
Bahasa (National Centre for Language Development), for his willingness to be the sponsor of
the linguistic studies carried out under the auspices of ISIR.
    In order to study the Hatam language in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya I also needed
and readily obtained permission from the authorities in Jayapura, Irian Jaya, and more
specifically in the regency (Kabupaten) Manokwari. I thank the heads of Sospol (Direktorat
Jenderal Sosial Politik) and Bappeda (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah) for
their permission.
    But with just the permission and support of the governmental authorities it is hard to study
a regional language such as Hatam. During my first visit to Manokwari, Rogier Gruys gave
me many useful suggestions about whom I should contact. So, before I even travelled to
Hatam territory, I visited the office of World Wide Fund for Nature, where various Hatam
speakers were employed. The director, Daud Womsiwor, arranged for me to meet with
Yohanes Wonggor and Marinus Mandacan, both from Mokwam. They taught me a few
useful expressions in Hatam, and supplied me with a letter in Hatam about regulations for the
nature reserve. Yohanes read it on tape and gave me the meaning in Indonesian.
    In Minyambou I was welcomed by the missionaries of The Evangelical Alliance Mission,
Dick and Char Griffiths and Walter and Dianne Kennedy. My thanks are due to them for
their hospitality and their help. The TEAM director in Manokwari, Elmer Lorenz, graciously
allowed me to use the organization's address and infrastructure to keep in contact with people
in my home country.
   There is no way to learn a language without native speakers willing to teach. Many Hatam
people have been very friendly and helpful. They were willing to tell stories, which I recorded
and transcribed, or just provided words or sentences which I needed in order to make progress
with my analysis. Thanks are due to: andigpoi Tuantiei Dowansiba, and Yoas Wonggor,
Yoas Iwou, Yairus Dowansiba, Erens Morum, Isak Mandacan, Esap Iwou. In particular, the
texts from Tuantiei were not always easy to understand. Hans Iwou, principal of the primary
school in Minyambou, was a patient and astute teacher. He not only helped me understand
xii   Acknowledgementsthese difficult texts, but also was able to answer my many questions regarding morphological
and syntactic complexities. When he was not at Minyambou during my second visit in 1 995,
I found his cousins Yakonias Iwou and Yoas Iwou willing to help me with my questions. But
Hans Iwou, living then at Maruni, could again answer some remaining questions, when I
returned from Minyambou to Manokwari in December 1 995.
   Finally, I want to express my thanks to two anonymous referees and Bert Voorhoeve for
commenting on a first draft. In particular, Bert had gone through the manuscript with a fine­
tooth comb, and made many valuable suggestions. I want to thank Jelle Miedema, Dianne
van Oosterhout and Leontine Visser for comments on an earlier version of the
anthropological notes in the Introduction. I have benefited from comments by Harry van der
Hulst and Ian Maddieson on the phonology chapter. Cecilia Ode has helped me with the
measurements and printing the spectograms. None of these people are, of course, responsible
for the flaws that remain.

   It should be clear from this short description that a number of questions remain. For
example, what exactly are the factors that determine differences such as between (2.73) and
(2.74)? Other topics which need further research are the geminates. At least for the bilabial
                                                                            Phonology       39and alveolar nasals and for voiceless stops of three points of articulation enough evidence for
geminates has been given. Possibly there are also geminates for the palatal stop and the
liquid. Whether geminates contrast in voice, as the orthography suggests, remains a question.
   Regarding the voiced-voiceless opposition, my tentative conclusion is that this holds only
for the onset of stressed syllables.
   Possibly a basic template for the prosodic form of lexical items in Hatam could account
for syllabic nasals, vowel or consonant status of VV(V) sequences, and occurrence
restrictions of geminates and certain vowels. But that would require a more theoretical
treatment than I considered desirable for this descriptive study.
   I hope to have at least indicated that Hatam is characterised by a clear iambic metre which
has full clauses or utterances as its domain, and not some kind of limited word stress.
3 Morphology
3.0 Introduction   This chapter gives the word classes that appear necessary for a description of Hatam. This
language, like the languages that are claimed to constitute the West-Papuan Phylum, has a
rather limited morphology. Inalienable nouns and verbs are prefixed to index person-number
of possessor and subject. To facilitate the treatment of nouns and verbs, I will first discuss
the personal pronouns. There are a number of clitics which apply either to lexical items or to
clausal constituents. These will be presented before the other word classes are discussed. The
way some of the clitics operate on different word classes can then be described in the
appropriate sections. This chapter then, will provide all the 'building blocks' which are
needed to account for the syntactic structures to be discussed in Chapter 4. In general I will
use the established orthography. At times, when necessary, phonetic realisations will be
specified.","[54, 55, 56]"

  Negation can be intensified to convey the sense of 'not at all' , 'by no means', by
combining the perception verb kan 'know' with the negative:
     (4.92)     Njap gom dem             mem ni-pilei           hab can kan       big.

                One day was not at all enough for us to shoot two birds. [Wonggor 1 .0 1 3 ]
    When both tulsu 'already' and big 'not' are clause-final, the question i s what happens
when both are present. The combination tulsu big does not occur. The realisation of 'not yet'
is by big + yo 'still', as in example (4.93). The reversed sequence does occur as in (4.94).

    The order Genitive-Noun was already used by Van der Veen ( 1 905:95) as a diagnostic feature of Non­
    Austronesian languages of North-Halmahera. See also Reesink ( 1 996) for a comparison of the Bird's Head
    languages in general with adjacent Austronesian languages.
82 . Ger P. Reesink4.1.2 Adjectives   Adjectives always follow the noun in an NP, when they function as attributives. As shown
in §3 .5, they contrast with verbs in this respect. In attributive position adjectives may occur in
three different shapes: (i) as a bare adjective (example 4. 1 5); (ii) with the relativiser di- (see
§3.2.5) as in (4. 1 6); and (iii) with the 3 SG.POS prefix ni-, as in (4. 1 7). The difference
between the morphological shapes of the attributive adjective is reflected in the free
translations.
   (4. 1 5)       wou     cun    di-ma
                  snake short REL-that
                  that short snake   (4. 1 6)       wou di-cun           di-ma

                  that snake which is short   (4. 1 7)       wou ni-cun            di-ma
                  snake 3SG-short REL-that
                  that short one of a snake
    In other words, the relative marker /dV-/ is employed to single out one individual from a
set of possible referents by a particular feature, expressed by the adjective. When the
adjective is marked with the third person singular prefix , it seems to indicate a more
permanent quality. The expression in (4. 1 7) would then refer to a snake that is inherently
short. Whether this is the correct interpretation is not clear. Thus, with respect to (4. 1 8a) and
(4. 1 8b) informants would say that (a) refers to a knife that is curved, while the (b) variant
would refer to a sickle which is bent even more. This could mean a temporary state, or a
permanent one of such a bent sickle. In other words, more data would be needed to ascertain
whether the semantic effect of 3SG.POS prefix is indeed a permanent quality. I have no
evidence to answer the question whether plural prefixes are possible in this construction.

44   This sentence leaves many questions. Sigau was explained as bencana alam 'natural disaster', while
     Griffiths ( 1 994: 68) gives 'storm'. Minyei ud was explained as telaga 'pond, lake', but it may also refer to
     'canoe' in that ud is 'stem, trunk' and is also used for 'canoe'. Sibau was explained as the name of a lake.
     Thus, the general meaning seems to be that the daughter of one of these sons was drowned, through a storm,
     while travelling by canoe on a lake. The syntactic relations between the lexical elements of this line are not
     clear to me.

"
3.2 Clitics    Hatam has a number of clitics. These are monosyllabic morphemes, which are
phonologically attached to a number of different word classes. They are mainly unstressed,
but as the discussion of metrical stress indicated, Hatam may shift stress quite easily away
from content words. Although some clitics can indeed never receive stress, some others can
form a iambic peak.
   There are five enclitics. Two occur on clause level: they are interrogative markers -i and
-e, which will be discussed in the section on question words. Two occur mainly on nominal
constituents. The citation marker -a and the inclusive disjunction marker -0 are directly
attached to nouns or the nominal modifiers that may follow in an NP. A third enclitic is the
nominalising device tilsi, which can be attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions.
The alternation of its initial consonant is determined by the coda of the preceding syllable. Of
these enclitics, only -0 may receive stress.
   Then there are three proclitics in Hatam: gi- and di- occur with verbs, adjectives and
demonstratives. Neither of these is ever stressed. A third proclitic is a weakened form of the
preposition bak 'for', namely bi- [b�], which has both prepositional and conjunctive functions.
There are instances of stress even on the clitic variant. The three enclitics on nominal
constituents will be discussed first, followed by the three proclitics.",[59]

                   They also, every day they would just walk around in the forest.
   Whether ghai 'scattered around' is indeed a preposition, as indicated in §3. 1 0, or perhaps
better analysed as a verb, is still a question. At any rate, it is found in reduplicated form and
nominalised as a modifier within a noun phrase:
     (3 . 1 95)    Ne       yai    bak di-munggwom-bat
                   TOP      get    to  1 SG-child-COLL

                   So, give (her) to my children the mountains surrounding me. [Koba 0 1 8]
     I have not found examples of noun reduplication, other than the temporal noun njap in
example (3 . 1 94). The only process I have observed involves full reduplication of stems.
Thus, it is not possible to have di-bong-di-bong ' l SG-sleep- 1 SG-sleep' in (3 . 1 93) or gi-ghai­
gi-ghai in (3 . 1 95). The instance of si-nggom si-nggom ' l DU-topple 1 DU-topple' in Anggos
( 1 2) in the Appendix appears to be a repetition, rather than a morphological reduplication.",[93]
"2.10 Metrical stress    All lexical items, whether monosyllabic or polysyllabic, allow stress marking, including
CV verbs, such as jo 'be somewhere', ku 'to hide'; nouns, such as b u 'nettle leaf', mo
'shrimp' ; adverbs, such as bu 'again' , and function words, such as ei 'at; to' and ba 'and'.
As mentioned with regard to bisyllabic words, the first syllable is never stressed, except in
two instances. Firstly, the suffix -ni on personal pronouns can never receive stress. Thus dani
'1', nyeni 'we' are never [da. 'ni] or [fie . 'ni]. Secondly, the clitic -a on citation forms of nouns
may never receive stress:
     (2.57)     igya           Jig-aJ         house-IND             =   ['iy.ya]
                sara           Jsar-aJ        lattice-IND           =   ['sa.ra]     (2.58)     nungugw-a        [nu. 'IJu.gwa]    mountain
                guri-a           [gu. 'ri.ya]      chicken
    Notice that I formulated the stress rule for words in isolation in negative terms. Whereas
suffixed pronouns and monosyllabic nouns show a trochaic pattern, bisyllabic words with or
without a final clitic suggest a iambic pattern. But when these words occur in running speech,
no rule can positively specify which syllable should be assigned stress. Only negatively, first
syllables of polysyllabic words (whether mono- or poly morphemic) can never be stressed,
suggesting a phrasal iambic metrical stress. Accent in Hatam cannot be stated in terms of
word pattern. It is related to a whole utterance or phrasal part thereof. Following a pause, or a
single long syllable, such as the connective ba 'and', a trough comes (almost) always first, as
in:
     (2.5 9)
                [ni.fi£ IJ.rI.n::>.bl .ji.bu.j£m. J Ba.rnI.fias.d;:).ni]

                Its name is bijibugjem. And the cloth [kain timur] . . . [Kain timur:003J4]The qualification of 'almost' is necessary, since the free personal pronouns, when suffixed,
always have the first syllable stressed: da-ni 'I-this' etc.
   The sequence of iambs in Hatam seems to be quite regular and gives a distinctive
rhythmic impression. A sequence of bisyllabic words in an NP maintains stress on words of
different classes in the following:
                                                                                 Phonology     33   (2.60)

   Content words, like monosyllabic verbs or nouns, do not necessarily attract stress. It
apparently depends on the overall pattern in the clause. For example, in (2.6 1 ), which
answers the question where a certain item can be found, [no.jo] forms the first iamb, with /jo/
being the peak.
   (2.6 1 )

have a voiced alveolar stop and stress on the second syllable. Native speakers insist that first
singular is dit-de, realised phonetically as [dgtE], which contrasts with an aspirated alveolar
voiceless stop in dete = [dgthE] 'my side'. Likewise nye-nde is realised as [nyente], without
aspiration. Possibly, some remnant of possessive linker is still present in some forms (see also
kinship terms as inalienable nouns in §3.3 . 1 ).
   In most instances the free pronouns are suffixed with -ni: dani, nani, noni, nyeni, jeni,
yoni, and sani. The suffix is identical to the near deictic ni 'this', possibly derived from it and
bleached of its deictic meaning. It is not quite clear which factors determine the distribution
of short and long free pronouns. Subject position seems to prefer the suffixed form, as in
example (3. 1 ), and (oblique) object position seems to favour the short forms, as in (3.2). But
this is certainly not a strict rule, as (3.3) shows.

    Finally, a construction which expresses that a certain item exists or is available should be
mentioned here. It makes use of the element nonaha, which is best translated as 'there are' or

4.3 Impersonal predicates  Hatam appears to have a few elements that behave as impersonal predicates. This
concerns the inanimate existential verb jo 'be at', the action verb bon 'make, do' and the
modal (see §3.4.6) dem 'enough'.
     (4.42)        Jo    ni-brei-si                 mem        da.

  Although dem 'enough' may be inflected for subject person/number, as in the elicited
example (4.44), it is preferable to have it in clause-initial position, as in (4.45).

"2.8 Consonant clusters   Tautosyllabic consonant clusters are rather limited. I n §2.5 I have already given
preconsonantal nasals as being syllabic. Complex onsets are formed by stops, except the
palatals, or lsi as first element followed by the liquid Irl, which is always realised with its
allophone flap [f], never by the lateral [1], as in:
     (2.38)     Ipr/:        Ipril              to jump
                /br/:        /bril              to clamber
                Itr/:        Itril              to sell
                Idr/:        Idruyl             to be startled
                Ikr/:        Ikril              to tie

                Isr/:        Isral              to cut along the grain
   Following a syllabic nasal, I have only found the ICrl cluster with voiced stop in my data,
as in:
     (2.39)     Imbr/:       Im.braPI           to talk
                Indr/:       In.draTI           to stub one's toe
                Inggr/:      Ing.greyl          to peel (a banana)But Griffiths has a few instances with voiceless stops and lsi:
                                                                               Phonology       29   (2.40)        mpri        Im.pril            k.o. frog

         so not necessarily part of the regular phonological system).
    If those instances of non-syllabic high vowels are indeed consonants, then two more
tautosyllabic clusters should be recognised, as [velar] + Iwl in example (2.4 1 ) and /hw/ or /hyl
in (2 .42).

2.9 Syllable structure   A number of observations made in earlier sections are relevant to an account of the
syllable and word structure of Hatam. I want to begin by giving the ev patterns found in
monosyllabic words. Whereas there is only one full lexical item with just V (2.43), the other
phonemic vowels (2.44) occur as clitics. That is, they always form the nucleus of a syllable
whose onset is taken from the last segment of the previous word.
   (2.43)       lui         to tether   (2.44)       /a/         citation marker

                Ii!         question marker
                101         inclusive disjunction
  Then there are ve stems with all five phonemic vowels:
   (2.45)       luKi        to go              [u(g)]          = he goes
                10m!        to press           [:>m]           = he presses
                leTI        to skin            ret]            = he takes skin off (banana)                lig!        house              ri Ck»�]        = house                lawl        prohibitive        raw]            = don't
  There are a number of monosyllabic words with the form ev.
  (2.46)        Ipal        to laugh
                /bal        and; to use

                Imol        shrimp
                lfiel       weIn eve words, all phonemic vowels may occur in the nucleus, all consonants in the single
onset (2.47). In the coda, only a subset of the consonants is allowed. As discussed in §2.3,
voicing is neutralised, and n o palatal stops or /hi are allowed.

    A complex onset in CCV(C) is limited to certain stops or lsi as first consonant with Irl in
second position. In example (2.3 8), instances of CCV have already been given. In (2.48),
CCVC items are illustrated. Thus, no Ic/, IjI, IbI, Iyl or Iwl can be followed by Ir/. That no
sequence of Igrl is attested may be an accidental gap, considering the occurrence of Ing.greyl
'to peel (e.g. banana)'.

   The CV patterns evidenced in monosyllabic words form the basis of polysyllabic words.
The basic form of bisyllabic words in Hatam can be given as a sequence of a weak (w) and a
strong syllable (s). That is, the stress is never on the first syllable.
     (2.49)     w                 s
                (C)(C)V(C)        C(C)V(C)
   There are a number of restrictions on the weak syllable. Recall that VC allows all
phonemic vowels in monosyllabic items. In the weak syllable without an onset, only the
vowels la!, lui and Iii are attested. That I cannot give examples with lei or 101 as initial vowels
in the weak syllable may be an accidental gap. The unspecified vowel [g], however, is not
possible without an onset.
   If the weak syllable lacks both an onset and a coda, V is la!, as in example (2.50), or lui,
as in (2.5 1 ). This mono morphemic pattern is repeated in inflected nouns and verbs with
second person singular prefix la-I; see §2.6.
     (2.50)    akou          lakowl      =   [a. 'kow]      ant
               adrom         ladrom!     =   [a. 'dr::>m]   leech

                    udop           ludoPI        =   [u.d::>p]           Wariori river
   Both /a/ and lu/ are also found i n initial position with a nasal a s coda of the weak syllable,
as in:
     (2.52)         undoi          /undoyl    = [un. 'doy]               hornbill
                    andigpoi       landigpoy/ = [an.'dik>poy]            elder
   Then there are words with initial Iii, but these all have a coda of [k>] preceding a stop,
similar to the realisation of lig/ 'house' in [ik>bey] 'house (as dwelling place)', so that I
assume the first syllable to have the phonological shape of fig!, as in:
     (2.53)         igpu          /igpu/         = [ik> . 'pu]           earwax
                    igtu          ligtu/         = [ik > . 'tu]          eel
                    igbit         /igbiTI        = [ik > . 'bit]         true
                    igdo          /igto/         = [ik > . 'to]          side1 2   In polysyllabic words, the stress pattern is an extension of this sequence: alternating 'w'
and 's', as seen in andigpoi (2.52). But when a prefix or proclitic is added to bisyllabic words,
none of the weak syllables with unspecified vowel may receive stress. It seems Hatam allows
more than one weak syllable before the strong one. For example, when monomorphemic
words like pilei 'shoot' or digo 'cut up' are inflected, the result is as in:
     (2. 54)        dipilei       IdV-pVreyl         [d::J.p::J. 'ley]   I SG-shoot
                    nidigo        InV-dVgo/          [n::J.d::J.'go]     l EXC-cut up
   Inflection for instrument (see §3.4. 7 . 1 ) provides a weak syllable between the subject
prefix and the verb stem:
     (2.55)        /dV-bV-pVrey/                 [d::J.b::J.p::J.'ley]   1 SG-INS-shoot
                   /nV-bV-dVgol                  [n::J.b::J.d::J. 'go]   l EXC-INS-cut up
   These forms may in turn receive the proclitic bi [b::J] , which marks a purposive relation
(see §3.2.6). The resulting string allows up to four weak syllables preceding a stressed one,
delivered in a very rapid speed. For example, 'so that I cut (something) up with (a mentioned
            ,
instrument) has the following phonological shape and phonetic realisation:
     (2.56)        /bV-dV-bV-dVgo/          [b::J.d::J.b::J.d::J.'go]
                   PUR- l SG-INS-cut.up
                   so that I cut up (something) with (an instrument)The onset of the strong syllable allows all the phonemic contrasts of consonants. The vowel
can be any of the five phonemic vowels, but never a schwa. The onset of a weak syllable
allows only a subset of the phonemic consonants. Whereas all nasals are allowed as syllabic,
if the vowel position is present, only 1m! and In! are attested. Although there are both voiced
and voiceless stops as onset of a weak syllable, as shown in example (2. 1 9), there are some
indications that this distinction is not required in this position. Firstly, there are no clear cases12   Griffiths gives igdo 'a part of, on the side of', while in my data I have [ik>toJ 'half, side (of a deer)'. The
     word igpu was given to refer to a cause of being deaf, which I took to mean 'earwax', while Griffiths has
     the gloss 'inflammation of the gums' for igpua. My interpretation could well be mistaken, when 'infection
     of the ear' was meant.
32      Ger P. Reesinkof fkI versus JgJ. Secondly, I have alternative realisations of words like JdVgoJ 'to cut up', as
in [t;:)go] and [d;:)go]. Thirdly, no geminates are found as onset of a weak syllable.
   I suspect that weak syllables may be realised with either voiced consonants, as in example
(2.5 6), or voiceless ones. I am rather cautious in making firm statements, because my
fieldwork was limited to Minyambou, where the two dialects Miriei and Tinam meet. It
seems that Miriei has less voicing than Tinam. Perhaps the contrast in voicing is in the
process of disappearing in Miriei faster than in Tinam. While I have no instances of [b;:)ley]
for pilei 'to shoot', my recordings do have a realisation of [p;:)IJgas] for IbVnggasJ 'goanna' by
a recognised Tinam speaker; see. example (2.60).","[44, 45, 46, 47, 48]"
"An interesting case of alternative realisation of stress on content words is provided by two
speakers who produced the test sentence (2.65), which was meant to ascertain the tense
consonant of the word for 'cracked' (Indonesian retak).",[50]

                   twenty           nya-tungwa-gom = 'PL-human-one'
   Phonetically, the compounds containing muhui + nda 'five' + 'hand', are realised as
[munda . . . ]. The cardinal number gom 'one' is also used as indefinite article: 'a certain/one or
another'.
   (3.98) (a) Di-sut      gom pilei.
              l SG-friend one     shoot
              One of my friends shot.               (b) Di-sut      gom bu          pilei.

                l SG-friend one     again also      shoot
                Yet another one of my friends shot.
   The same item also forms the basis for the universal quantifier 'all', when it is prefixed by
the (marginally) productive ha- 'be/do', which then is inflected as a verb:
   (3.99) (a) Tungwa-tu-nya ya-ha-gom              y-ug.
              human-?-PL       3PL-be-one          3PL-go
              All the people went.            (b) Nyeni na-ha-gom             n-ug.
                we      1 EXC-be-one        l EXC-go
                We all went.
   The quantifiers mang 'many' and poi 'a few, some' behave as adjectives. The former can
be intensified with bibor 'very' , and both occur with the classifier -bou when referring to
humans: i-bou mang bibor 'very many of them'; ni-bou poi 'the few of us; some of us'.

60       Ger P. Reesink   The quantity 'some, a few' can also be expressed by reduplication of the cardinal number
'one': gom-gom 'one-one' :

   Finally, 'someone or another' is based upon the adjective hi 'another' and is apparently
verbal, as illustrated in:

inflected verbs to link these items as modifiers to a head noun, when its referent needs to be
contrasted to a set of possible alternatives. Again, this form is never stressed. Often it is in
combination with no '3SG', as in example (3.39). A form with similar function, but more
anaphoric than ostentive, is po, with a weak variant [p;:)], as on the demonstrative in (3.39).
Their functions will be discussed in §4.6. Some examples are:
   (3 . 3 7)      puig di-ni
                  path REL-this
                  this path   (3.38)          Ni-huk       yo   di     i-nggimang radio.

    These can be made explicit, as Hans Iwou did, when he saw me writing <puk> for 'to pick' (memetik):
    ""oh, ke, phuk>, �ukh itu khetu0. Kalau pakai kata kha itu khetuphintu, kalau ge, itu memeti0, jadi
    [phug>]""    'Oh, ge, [puk>], [pukh] means ketuk ( knock on door), If you use fkI it means ketuk pintu 'knock on a
    door', if /g! it means memetik 'pick fruit/flower', so it is [pug]. '
                                                  =
    Thus, in careful speech h e made a difference between an unreleased versus a released velar stop: the former
    was used for what he considered to be a final /g!, the latter for fkI. But as we have seen, final stops before a
    pause may be realised either way, neutralising voice.

                     it is by means ofIn my data, I have clear evidence for Ig! following the high front vowel. The nouns ig 'house'
and tig 'stone', for example, are in isolation given as [i�ya] and [tiHa]. When followed by a
demonstrative [d;)ma], one would get [ik> d;)ma] 'house that', [tik> d;)ma] 'stone that'. In
natural speech, sindig 'old woman' is realised with a light palatal friction between the high
front vowel and the following schwa in sindig gom 'one old woman' [sIndi�;)g:)m] and with
an unreleased voiceless stop preceding a nasal in the next sentence sindig ni-nyeng 'old
woman 3SG-name' as [sIndik> ninYElJ] 'the old woman's name'. And 'he goes and arrives' is
ug ndei, which is realised as [ulJdey], with the initial alveolar nasal accomodating the velarity
of the 'hidden' stop.
    Although rik 'tom' is the only attested item with I ... ik/, phonetically [rikh], there are a few
contrasts between I ... ig! and I ...i!. The phonological forms with I .. .ig! are realised as [i] or [i�]
in isolation and with an unreleased (palato-)velar stop preceding voiced bilabial or alveolar
stopS. 7 Consider:

    Other evidence for a final velar stop following the high front vowel in some lexical items,
is the choice of the allomorph of the enclitic nominaliser tilsi, as in examples (2. 1 3) and
(2. 1 4). Similar phonological conditioning affects tu/su 'already' and tutlsut 'along with'. The
allomorph with the grooved fricative betrays the phonological presence of the 'hidden' velar,
which is recognised in the orthography. Consider:

   Following high vowels, the opposition between final lkl and Igi is found in the fact that Igi
is either elided or realised as an approximant preceding vowels, while IkI is voiced in that
environment. Before stops, both are phonetically unreleased voiceless.
   Rather similar is the fate of the words with the vocoid sequences [ei], [ail or [ou]. In
isolation, no velar stop is present in the lexical items, given in example (2. 1 5). In other words,
neither a pause nor a following vowel suggests a final stop.
   (2. 1 5)       wou        [wowa]         snake

                  bitai      �tBY]          four
   But when the items from (2. 1 5) occur preceding a consonant, a voiceless unreleased velar
stop surfaces:
   (2. 1 6) (a)   [wowk> d;}ma]
                  wou      di-ma

                  these four
   Whether the phonological shape of these words should have a final stop is not clear. If the
high vowel is indeed consonantal, as argued in §2 .7, it would imply a complex coda. Perhaps
the velar is a phonetic juncture between an approximant and a following stop. Possibly, a
similar phenomenon occurs with [ui] as in [Tui�] 'Sougb', [dui�] 'coconut', which are given in
the orthography as Tuigya, duigya , and similar items. But I have not been able to ascertain a
distinction between such words and kui 'ascend', mui 'cooked, dry' and so on. So far, I have
not found this phenomenon with other vocoid sequences, such as [iu], [eu], [au], or [oi].
20        Ger P. Reesink2.4 Palatal series   Given the restricted distribution of Icl, IjI, and lfiJ, the question is warranted whether the
palatal consonants do indeed deserve phonemic status, or whether they are the realisation of
C+liI. Consider the restrictions:
(i)       [ii] does not occur word-finally, in contrast to the nasals of other points of articulation.
          In initial position Hatam has [roi] and [IJi] as in [miyap] '3SG.hears' and [IJYoy] 'cheek'
          (which I also recorded as [iioyD. Thus, [ii] could realise the sequence [ni].(ii)      Whereas bilabial, alveolar and velar stops are present in final position, albeit
          neutralised with respect to voicing, the palatal stops do not occur word-finally.8(iii)     The palatal stops [c] and [j] cannot be followed by Irl in consonant clusters, as opposed
          to all other stops (see §2. 8).
   These restrictions suggest that the palatals may not have phonemic status as other stops or
nasals, that they may be the phonetic merging of an alveolar consonant plus a front high
vowel. But such an interpretation is not quite possible in the light of items such as [cin] 'a
pair' , [tilJ] 'far', and [cErn] 'also' versus [tiyey] 'white'; as well as [jit] 'true' and [jiya]
'chin.CIT' versus [diya] 'slippery'.
   Although my own data do not contain instances of palatal stops followed by a vocoid
series with [HIGH] in first position, Griffiths ( 1 994) lists: ciem 'rocks heated for pit cooking'
and diem 'leak through which liquids flow'. These items imply a contrast between [ciyEm]
'heated rocks' and [CErn] 'also' and [diYEm] 'leak' versus [jEm] 'to call ' and [yEm] 'to eat '.
When polymorphemic words are considered, there are more. Consider the verbs yem 'to eat'
and jem 'to call'. Without a prefix the forms [yem] and [jem] mean '3SG.eat' and '3 SG.call'
respectively. With first person singular the forms are IdV-yernl [diyem] and IdV-jernl [dijem],
and with second person plural [jiyem] and [jijem], clearly constituting a contrast between [j]
and [di]. If indeed there is also a geminate member of the series, as Griffiths' jjei 'to crawl'
suggests, the palatal series is parallel to the stops of other points of articulation.
   Similarly, the clear contrast between [ni.yay] '3SG-eye' or ' l EXC-take' (morphologically
InV-yayl in both cases) on the one hand and [iiay] 'other side of river' (morphologically liiay/)
on the other suggests that lfiJ may be taken as a fourth phonemic nasal. My conclusion is that
Hatam has a palatal series of stops and nasal, which cannot be equated with a realisation of
the sequence alveolar stoplnasal and front high vowel.","[33, 34, 35, 36]"

   It seems significant that the impersonal predicate has a purpose clause, introduced by mem
as its complement, as in (4.45). A similar construction has a nominalised adjective as its

sentences with a modal adverb in initial position, in that the latter do not have a complement
clause with mem 'for' (see further §4.4. 5).","[102, 103]"

    It would seem that directional verbs as y2 obligatorily lack subject prefixation. 1 1
Apparently, more general motion verbs as y2 do not obey this rule: a-ttei mikwau dini
{lj-mbut tut is not acceptable in the following:
      (4. 1 09)    A-ttei           mikwau      dini       a-mbut          tut

   As conveyed by the free translations of examples (4. 1 05) and (4. 1 06), the sequence with
directional verb as y2 seems to function more as a unit than when y2 is some other verb, as
in (4. 1 09). Although [V I = transitive + y2= directional] appears to form a tight sequence,
Hatam does not allow a tighter sequence of action + motion verb with the object of y l after
                                                             ,
the motion verb: *di-ttei kwei srat 'I-carry come letter .l2 The unweakened form ba 'and' is
allowed in such sequences, as long as the verb following the connective is marked for person­
number of the subject, indicating it has the same referent as the verb preceding it. Thus, a
natural, i.e. unelicited, sentence as in example (4. 1 1 Oa) has various alternative realisations:
      (4. 1 1 0) (a) Lene    {lj-pilei       hanyen       bu        lene     {lj-nduk
                     then    3SG-shoot       return       again     then     3SG-gather
                    nyeni ba     ni-ttei.       Ba ni-kwei            bam.
                    us     and 1 EXC-carry and 1 EXC-come roast
                    Then he shot (Pig) again and called us together and we carried (it). And we
                    came and roasted (it). [Wonggor 1 :056]
   The first sentence in (4. 1 1 Oa) ends with ni-ttei carrying a final falling intonation, followed
by a (long) pause. It is also possible to merge the two sentences into one, resulting in a
sequence of three verbs, of which only the first one is prefixed. The reason why these three
verbs are asyndetically linked, it seems, is that the second verb is directional kwei. It is
uninflected because it is y2 specifying direction for the transitive verb ttei 'carry', and it is
y l with respect to bam 'roast':
      (4. 1 1 0) (b) lene {lj-nduk        nyeni ni-ttei         {lj-kwei                       (lj-bam . . .

    What I call epenthetic vowels here may well involve weakened realisations of the citation
clitic -a. Within NPs it occurs on nouns preceding monosyllabic numerals gom 'one' and can
'two'. The possible explanation that this suggests some linkage between a nominal and a
predicate is weak in the light of the earlier example (2 .65) with biged 'rain' as subject.
Apparently, the schwa or weakened form of citation -a is not obligatory, as also shown by
(2.73) and (2.74), taken from the text Kain timur. I have no explanation for the alternative
realisation of ni-bok gom which takes a schwa to create two canonical iambs in (2.7 3),
whereas ni-bok can in (2.74) leaves the final iamb 'extrametrical'.

"4. 7. 1 Sequencing conjunctions4. 7. 1. 1 ba 'and'   Basically, ba signals a rather neutral addition of actions or events by the same subject, as
in examples (4. 1 90) and (4. 1 9 1 ).
   (4. 1 90)     Kwanding     juk        leu      biei nggramti

                 Thereupon we came (and/to) roast (the deer) and we ate.[Wonggor 1 :050]
   When subjects of consecutive clauses refer to subsets, ba can be used. For example, in
example (4. 1 92) the second subject, third person singular, was part of the first subject, first
person plural exclusive, while in (4. 1 9 3) the first person singular of the first subject is a
member of the set referred to by the first person plural exclusive in the following clause.

   Perhaps it would be better to substitute 'same topic' for 'same subject', since not only are
subsets of referents considered as 'same', but when (oblique) objects of the first predicate
1 22       Ger P. Reesinkhave the same referent as the subject (or possessor) of the second conjunct, ba is used.
Consider example (4. 1 94), where the direct object of the first predicate has the same referent
as the subject of the second, which is not different from what is described as purposive
sequence in §4. 5 . 3 . In (4 . 1 9 5) the conjuncts are separated by a clear pause, followed by a
new nominal subject, referring to the same participant. In (4. 1 96) the possessor of the second
conjunct has the same referent as the zero anaphoric object of the first one.

   In fact, occurrences of ba as in example (4. 1 95) could be interpreted as meaning 'in
addition (I want to say)', which seems to be the function when ba is used to introduce
sentences following some collateral information, as in (4. 1 97), where the narrator has just
told that the Hatam people used to trade kain timur only with each other and neighbouring
groups.
       (4. 1 97)     Ba,   nyeni mpe di        mahan         tu. . .
                     and   we     time REL adolescent already

26     A similar construction seems to occur in (i) below. This could present a problem for the characterisation of
       ba as same subject sequence, if indeed the subject of pim is not Hambong, but Kwanding, who is holding the
       other end of the comb Hambong held out to her. Given that (ii) follows in the story, I take it that in (i) the
       narrator had meant Kwanding, and mistakenly said Hambong.
(i)         Hambong     su-o        nsus     ba    Kwanding krau         ne-te            hi

conjuncts than ba. There are many instances of .billh same and subject sequences marked by
lene in narrative texts, as illustrated by examples (4. 1 98) and (4. 1 99).
   (4. 1 98)   Di-mbut   ei        mpia di-no    undoi               mang

               Then we touched (it) and then the cuscus scrambled away. [Wonggor 1 :020]
   In §4.S.2 we have seen Instruments being linked to the main clause by means of ba. In
narratives it is mainly lene that is found in this function. Either a nominal instrument, as in
(4.200), or a time phrase (4.20 1 ), is given and linked to the main clause by lene:
   (4.200)     Pinda hou     gom lene di-bi-non               hacam-o.
               gun    wind one       then   l SG-INS-shoot hawk-or
               With a shotgun then I shot hawks (etcetera). [Wonggor 1 :0030]   (4.20 1 )   Nipou     dima lene nyeni '71.ok munggwom mien                     he ...

               Before then we were only small children . . . [Wonggor 1 :0 1 3]
    The clearest evidence for contrast between neutral addition of ba and sequentiality of lene
is the fact that I have not found ba as introduction of apodosis of conditionals or temporal
contingencies. This is always done by lene (or the even stronger sequential api), as in:
   (4.202)     Gi-no           i-suar   dihyei ei            minu
               NOM-3SG         3PL-need ground LOC           place

               If they needed ground at another village, then they usually asked them about
               the price of the ground. [Kain timur:036]
4. 7. 1.2. 1 Combinations with lene    Given the meaning of lene as opposed to ba, namely that a stronger sense of sequentiality
is involved, it is not surprising to find lene combined with other elements to express notions
such as 'after', 'after a while', 'before' and 'so then'. Such combinations are not possible with
ba .
    The phasal aspect marker tulsu on the first conjuct, followed by lene expresses 'after the
first event, the second', as in:
1 24     Ger P. Reesink     (4.203)      Noni      bon  ha-gom          bi-put     tu      lene

                  After he had made everything he said to his son, .... [Habel 1 :0006]
   When the first conjunct is followed by the contrastive conjunction lo and the negative big,
the time span between the consecutive events is lengthened. The sequence lo big lene 'after a
while' in example (4.204) has virtually become a complex conjunction.
     (4.204)       Kwanding gwam lo            big    lene kut kimbrim           gam.
                   Kwanding sit          but not      then cut bamboo            one

                   [K wanding: 004]
  The opposite temporal relation 'before X, Y happened' is expressed by the same
conjunction lene following the aspectual big-yo 'not-yet' of the first conjunct. Consider:
     (4.205)   Nipou di-pek        pinda hou         big-yo lene di-pek         kataper.
               before I SO-get gun           wind not-yet then         I SO-get catapult

   As sentence introducer the complex nok lene 'like and then 27 signals a paragraph-like

4. 7. 1.3 api 'thereupon '  The connector api is much less frequent than lene 'then; so' or ba 'and'. Its sense is more
explicitly sequential, or even causal, suggesting a translation like 'consequently', as in
example (4.208). But in the latter case it often is in conjunction with third person pronoun:
api-no 'so then' (4.209), or leu 'from': leu api 'because of that then', as in (4.2 1 0).

     stop elided.

4. 7. 1 . 4 Series of conjunctions   That api has more of a semantic factor 'consequence' can also be deduced from the fact
that both ba and lene occur preceding api. Such a sequence does not form a compound
conjunction, but rather a repair to a more explicit indication of sequence or consequence. In
(4.2 1 2) for example, a heavy pause divides the two conjunctions.

     In the example below ug-e occurs sentence-finally, clearly functioning as an aspectual adverb meaning
     'first':          Dani       mi-di-mbut         noro     dit-de       midyai    put      ug-e.

   Similarly, ba and lene may occur juxtaposed. In example (4. 2 1 3 ) lene comes first,
followed by a pause, suggesting a repair to a lesser degree of sequentiality. On the other
hand, in (4.2 1 4) ba and lene are phonetically merged into [bgr;me], suggesting addition +
sequence.

4. 7.2 Contrastive conjunctions    Hatam has two conjunctions, which are morphologically related, to express a contrastive
relation between two clauses. The basic form is lo, which, combined with the third person
pronoun no, gives noro 'but'. Recall that Hatam does not have a phonemic contrast between
[r] and [1]. Nevertheless, I have encountered neither [nolo] nor [co].","[137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142]"
"However, the alternative Papuan order is equally possible, either with or without the plurality

(4. 1 4b):

                   He grabbed his dogs and threw (them).
    Informants either claim there is no difference, or try to restrict the postnominal
construction to situations where there is some temporal distance. For example, a-de
munggwom-nya '2SG-POS child-PL' is explained as direct address to the hearer, while
munggwom a-de-nya would be used when the children are no longer present. Such an
explanation is hardly relevant to the difference between (4. 1 4a) and (4. 1 4b). My conclusion
is that the postnominal possessives stand in an appositional relation to the possessed noun.
The prenominal position is by far the more frequent one in my data.",[97]

      Beisi is what a garden full of ripening plants is called, when it is ready for harvesting. As the garden is being

      The meaning of this sentence was given as Kami asal Hatam tidak gampang seperti 'We Hatam women
      are not that easy (to get)"" as represented by the free translation. Mipong had made a sexual overture, by
      asking her if the pig had bitten her. But Kwanding is not interested in him and rejects him. The actual
      morphemes are not clear: yak may also be '3PL' in which case the following nya is 'PLural' and ci could be
      a verb meaning 'chase'. But nyaci could be n-ya ti, a nominalisation of 'we stand'= 'our standing is in the
      open', or something similar. The narrator's toothless pronunciation didn't make it easy for other informants
      to interpret what exactly he did say.

 in (4. 1 29) or the total event as its object, as a full clause in (4. 1 30).

   The clausal complement of miap 'hear' is optionally, that of kan 'thinklknow' obligatorily
introduced with the complementiser pia:
     (4. 1 3 1 )    Di-kan            pia  dip-misop                ni-ngon   ngakei
                    l SG-know         QUOT l SG-daughter            3SG-heart (?)

                    man that      not
                    I do not know whether my daughter loves that man. 16
   The complementiser pia is glossed as QUOTE, since it is almost always present to
introduce quoted speech, whether direct or indirect; see examples (4 . 1 32a) and (4. 1 32b). The
difference between direct and indirect speech is signalled only by the shift in person category
of the pronoun(s) in the quote:
     (4. 1 32) (a) Annani            dani      di-pai   bak nom          pia
                   yesterday         I         l SG-say to  him          QUOT
                    nani suar a-wim          miai.
                    you    need 2SG-cut garden

                   yesterday         I         l SG-say to         him    QUOT
                    nom suar 0-wim            miai.

                    Yesterday I told him that he had to cut the garden.
   Another example of indirect speech employs the prefixed QUOTE marker bi-pia, which I
interpret as an instance of the instrument prefix, since a purposive would be followed by
subject prefix (if/when applicable)'7:
     (4. 1 3 3)     I-hig     ser      bi-pia   -ndo                     i-ntun       him

                    (If) we inquire that he show us their exact place of origin, they will show (it) to
                    us. [Yairus 026]   Direct speech would have had a-ndo '2SG-show' instead of 0-ndo '3SG-show', following
bi-pia . Compare the direct and indirect speech variants of the event 'pig bites youlher' in
examples (4. 1 34a) and (4. 1 34b), both unelicited, taken from the Kwanding myth:
16
     This sentence can also mean 'I know that my daughter does not love that man'. For further discussion of
     scope of negative see §4.5.6. For ngon ngakei 'love' see §3.4.5.
17   In example (4. 1 33) it could be that third person plural has disappeared through assimilation. But if the
     subject were first person singular, for example, one would get:           di-hig ser bi-pia.. . and not: *di-hig ser bi-di-pia.

    Other speech verbs using (bi-)pia include hig 'to ask', hara 'to request; call out' and jem
'to call'. The latter uses (bi-)pia 'QUOTE' when it refers to naming persons or objects, as in:
   (4. 1 35)   Gi-ma         i-ba    ni-hyet       Mor           i-jem

               That one they call in Indonesian Burung Pintar (= Bowerbird). [Wonggor
               1 :005]Without the quote marker, this verb functions in a similar structure as perception verbs or
'manipulative' verbs, such as nduk 'to gather' (compare example (4. 1 1 0). Consider:   (4. 1 36)   Apino     0-jem         yok     i-kwei   ndam          noni

4.5.5 Generaljuxtaposition    As the examples in the introduction to this section show, juxtaposition of verbal predicates
is not restricted to the Directional, Instrumental, Purposive and Perception/Speech
complements. As far as I can tell, juxtaposition of verbal predicates -with or without explicit
object NPs in the case of transitive verbs -always involves a same subject sequence. This
'rule' excludes perception and speech verbs as V I , as we have seen. Secondly, juxtaposed
verbs are always both marked with a subject prefix, when applicable. This 'rule' excludes
i) verbs immediately following Directional verbs, ii) Directional verbs specifying direction for
main verbs and iii) optionally, V2's of Instrumental sequences. But even juxtaposed
                                                                                          Syntax     1 07directional verbs can be prefixed, as can be seen in i-nang y-ug 'they fled and went' in
[Yairus 2:067] (see footnote 1 1 above), and in another instance of intransitive verbs in series:
       (4. 1 3 7)          Sop        cin    idnJ2.J&1.
                                                      i -kwei         su

   Some sequences of intransitive verbs could be interpreted as V2 being an adverbial
modifier of V I . Such sequences do not allow an intervening conjunction ba 'and', as shown
by example (4.96), repeated here as (4. 1 3 8); (4. 1 3 8b) is unacceptable.
       (4. 1 3 8) (a) Ni-hara     ni-nggum . . .
                      l EXC-ask l EXC-hungry
                      We ask (because) we are hungry ...
                           *
                     (b)    ni-hara    ba    ni-nggum
   Sequences of transitive verbs are simply tight temporal sequences, which in contrast with
'adverbial sequences' can easily be conjoined by ba 'and':
       (4. 1 39)           I-ttei     njinta (ba) i-biak            yok.
                           3PL-take food       (and) 3PL-host them
                           They take food (and) host (= put on a big meal) them. [Dowansiba 06 1 ]
4.5. 6 Scope of negation   As mentioned in §4.4.9, the negative adverb big (as well as negative imperative au) is
always in clause-final position. I should say rather that it occurs sentence-finally, because, as
seen in example (4. 1 3 1 ) above, negation of a perception verb is effected by big following the
complement clause. It is ungrammatical to have the negative in between the main predicate
and its complement:
       (4. 1 40)           *Dani di-ngat big             nab yem dit-de       siep.
                           I         I SG-see not        pig eat     I SG-POS sw.potato
                           I didn't see that the pig ate my sweet potatoes.
   The strictly final position of the negative implies that any negative sentence consisting of
more than one clause allows more than one interpretation, depending on whether the scope of
the negation includes the main or the subordinate predicate. Consider:
       (4. 1 4 1 )         Dani   di-ngat nab             yem   dit-de   bikau        big.
                           I      I SG-see pig            eat   I SG-POS sw.potato    notThis sentence can have two readings:(i)        I didn't see (that) the pig ate my sweet potatoes.
(ii)       I saw (that) the pig didn't eat my sweet potatoes.
Likewise:
108       Ger P. Reesink      (4. 1 42)       Dani   di-miap     (pia)      yoni    sisip i-mbrab      big.

(ii) I don' t hear them talking. (= They may be talking but I don' t hear them.)
    Disambiguation of examples (4. 1 4 1 ) and (4 . 1 42) is possible only on pragmatic grounds.
Not only negative sentences involving perception complements are semantically opaque. The
various verb sequences described in §4.S. 1 -§4.S.S allow similar multiple interpretations,
albeit that some interpretations are more easily available than others. Consider the following
examples: (i) adverbial, (ii) directional verb plus main, (iii) main verb plus directional, (iv)
instrumental, (v) resultative, (vi) speech and (vii) perception verbs with their complements
under negation.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124]"

   The final IK/ of IngwaK/ 'empty' in example (2.6) is unreleased, preceding a morpheme­
initial stop, and the final /KI of l-ngwaK/ 'forehead' in (2.7) is a voiced velar stop, followed
by a schwa. This schwa could be a transitional element, helping to define a contrast between
final voiced versus voiceless stops, or to shape the preferred rhythmic pattern, but I rather

the different realisations are due to the phonetic environment, rather than the inherent
phonological shape.
   As far as I know, there are no possible minimal pairs within the word class nouns. Similar
phonetic realisation of nouns such as bed-a 'moon-CIT' or ngwag-a 'forehead-CIT' and
words of other categories, such as the verb bet 'to wait' or adjective ngwak 'empty' never
cause misunderstanding. Only within the class of verbs have I found minimal pairs suggesting
a contrast between voiced and voiceless velar stops in final position, but these are restricted
to verbs with the vowel lui, as in huk 'to chase, hunt' versus hug 'to pour', cuk 'to order'
                         ,
versus cug 'to threaten .6
   There does seem to be a phonological contrast in voicing between velar stops in word-final
position, revealing itself in phonetic realisations. This is limited, however, to environments
following high vowels. Consider the following items as given in isolation:
    (2.8)          !hukl          [hukh]; [huk>]                 to chase, hunt

   Words with final lkl or Ig! can both be realised with unreleased voiceless stops. The items
with final Ig! are also (and mainly) realised without a stop in isolation. They end in just a
vowel or an unreleased approximant following lui or a light palatal friction following Iii. The
(palato-)velar consonant does betray itself in the environment of a following consonant. For
example, preceding /hi, there is a contrast between !hukl 'hunt' and Itug! 'pound', as in (2.9).
The voiceless IkI is phonetically realised, the voiced Ig! is not.

3.2. 4 Nominalising gi   The clitic gi- can be found preceding spatial deictics, adjectives and verbs to form a

                NOM-that what
                What is that?                (b) gi-kui

                    the/an ascending oneSuch constructions contrast with more specific referring relativisations, as in:     (3.34) (a) ig     di-ma

                that house (out of a set of possible entities)                (b) no    di   (no)     kui

                    the one who is ascending (= one specific referent out of of a given set)

promise 3SG-new) = 'the new promise' for 'New Testament', or in attributive position, as in
ni-nei gi kwes (3SG-breath NOM clear) = 'Holy Spirit'. Unfortunately, I do not have
unelicited examples or instances not involving translation of foreign concepts.
   With or without the third person pronoun (no), gi may precede complete clauses to signal
conditionality or, more generally, topical circumstance.

"Thus, the first interpretation of (4. 1 47) is 'I hit the pig but it didn't die'. However, 'I didn't hit
the pig, but it died of another cause' is also possible. On the other hand, for the negative
sentence (4. 1 48), the preferred interpretation is 'They didn't draw water for me to drink'.",[126]

    If a Direct Object is not expressed, but an 'adverbial' verb series is involved (see example
(4. 1 43) above), the RC formation is similar. The verbs are in immediate sequence with the
preposition following:
   (4. 1 8 1 )   Andigpoi    di-no   ni-hara            ni-nggum               bak
                 elder       REL-3SG l EXC-ask          l EXC-hungry           to

                 that   he      push
                 The elder that we asked for something (because) we were hungry, he refused.
   The verb ndo 'to show; point', which always marks the Recipient with bak or its weakened
form bi- in main clauses, allows relativisation on the Recipient with 'stranded' preposition, as
in example (4. 1 82), but the RC may also be formed without bak, as in (4. 1 8 3).

"3.2.2 Inclusive disjunction -0   A second clitic that attaches mainly to nominal elements is -0. It is glossed as 'or', since its
most transparent function is to indicate inclusive disjunction, as in example (3 .22). It can
have the stress of a iambic peak with the content word being relegated to a iambic trough, as
in [ng.'huk ha. 'bo], or can be unstressed as in [ng. 'gok mi. 'ye.yo].

   Related to the function of inclusive disjunction is the sense of 'there's more to come', in
which case it is possible to have only one instance of -0 in a clause, and not necessarily
attached to a nominal, as illustrated in example (3.23). Its function comes close to signalling
a hesitation. All recorded instances of -0 are followed by a pause.

2.6 Unspecified vowel   Besides the monomorphemic words with an initial syllabic nasal, there are a number of
other presumably monomorphemic words consisting of more than one syllable. The great
majority of these bisyllabic words have the form CV.CV(C), although vowel-initial words are
also possible. But these will be discussed in §2.9.
   If the first syllable has an onset, the vowel is either a schwa (example 2 . 1 9), or the same
as the vowel in the second syllable (examples 2.20 and 2 .2 1 ). [;}] is a mid central vowel, with
a slightly fronted quality, almost sounding as [1]. Preceding palatals it may acquire even a
higher quality as [i]. It can never be the vowel in a monosyllabic word. In bisyllabic words it
can never occur in the second syllable, because it can never receive stress.

necessary to break up illicit consonant clusters. But there does seem to be a contrast between
[IJ .gruk] 'difficult' and [IJ .gg.luk] 'vein, tendon'.9 So, rather than assuming a number of
consonant clusters, it seems better to postulate a phonemic vowel position in the initial
syllable, which has a rather wide range of phonetic realisation: [g], [1] or [i]. And if the onset
of the stressed syllable is /hi, the unspecified vowel is identical with the stressed one, as in
example (2.20). Intervocallic /hi is always voiced.     (2.20)        [dafiat]        to break (tr. and intr.)

3. 13.5 Sentence-final adverbs   Although some adverbs, such as cem 'also' and bu 'again' are often found in clause-final
position, they can also occur in other positions, as seen in example (3. 1 79). The negative
adverbs big 'not' and au 'must/should not' and the phasal aspect adverbs tu (su) 'already' and
yo 'still, yet', as also in combination with big in bigyo 'not yet', are always in a final position:
   (3. 1 8 1 )   Lene ni-ngat      mbrei       hi      big-yo.

instrument will be further discussed in §4.5.2.
   The general clause formula gives the most common word order. However, other word
orders are possible. Hatam does allow (oblique) objects to be preposed, or time adverbials in
clause-final position. Adverbs are possible at various positions throughout the clause, except
between verb and direct object. These options will be shown when I discuss each clause
constituent in §4.4. But first the general structure of the noun phrase, with comments on its
constituents, will be presented in §4. 1 . Section 4.2 will illustrate non-verbal predications,
which are not covered by the general clause formula. Another construction that does not
correspond to the verbal clause involves impersonal predicates. This will be presented in §4.3.
A rather striking feature of Hatam is its prolific use of asyndetic verb sequences. Since this
phenomenon is pertinent to the issue of serial verb constructions, I will discuss various
combinations of predications and the scope of negation which they allow in some detail in
§4.5. Relative clauses with their possible head nouns are dealt with in §4.6. This chapter will
close with a presentation of clause combinations in §4 .7, according to the conjunctions as
given in §3 . 1 5 .",[95]

    In the orthography 'angry' is given as gga. But in my recordings the consonant is always voiceless and
    slightly aspirated.
16        Ger P. Reesink2.3 Final stops   Word-finally, the palatal stops do not occur. For the other stops the voiced-voiceless
contrast is neutralised. I will give evidence for stops of three places of articulation:
(i)       Regarding bilabial stops, in one sentence one may find: [m�mbron� mem sop>]
          'brideprice for woman', immediately followed by [atau ibuwak> soph] 'or they marry
          women'. Nouns in citation form are always 'suffixed' with the vowel -a, whether they
          end in vowel or consonant. In that context, no noun 'ends' with a voiceless stop, which
          gives [sob-a] 'woman' as citation form. Thus IsoPI 'woman' is realised with (a) an
          unreleased voiceless bilabial stop or (b) a released voiceless one preceding a pause, or
          (c) a voiced bilabial stop preceding a vowel.(ii)      As for alveolar stops, the verb IngaTI 'to see' is realised as [I)at] utterance-finally in:
       (2.2)       [a-yay      b�-dani mEm d�-I)ath]
                   2SG-give to-me           for     l SG-see
                   Let me see it. (lit. Give it to me so I can see it.)Alternatively, it is [I) ad] preceding a vowel, as in the more polite request, using the
interrogative particle -i:       (2.3)       [a-yay    �-dani mEm d�-I)ad-i]
                   2SG-give to-me        for     l SG-see-Q

FOUNDING EDITOR:      Stephen A. Wurm
EDITORIAL BOARD: Malcolm D. Ross and Darrell T. Tryon (Managing Editors),
                      John Bowden, Thomas E. Dutton, Andrew K. PawleyPacific Linguistics is a publisher specialising in linguistic descriptions, dictionaries, atlases and
other material on languages of the Pacific, the Philippines, Indonesia and Southeast Asia.
The authors and editors of Pacific Linguistics publications are drawn from a wide range of
institutions around the world.
Pacific Linguistics is associated with the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at The
Australian National University. Pacific Linguistics was established in 1 963 through an initial
grant from the Hunter Douglas Fund. It is a non-profit-making body financed largely from
the sales of its books to libraries and individuals throughout the world, with some assistance
from the School.
The Editorial Board of Pacific Linguistics is made up of the academic staff of the School's
Department of Linguistics. The Board also appoints a body of editorial advisors drawn from
the international community of linguists. Publications in Series A, B and C and textbooks in
Series D are refereed by scholars with relevant expertise who are normally not members of
the editorial board.
To date Pacific Linguistics has published over 400 volumes in four series:
Series A:       Occasional Papers; collections of shorter papers, usually on a single topic or
                area.
Series B:       Monographs of intermediate length.
Series C:       Books; publications of greater length, especially reference books such as
                dictionaries and grammars, and conference proceedings.
Series D:       Special Publications; including archival materials, pedagogical works, maps,
                audiovisual productions, and materials that do not fit into the other series.","[1, 2]"
