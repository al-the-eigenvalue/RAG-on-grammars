"15.1        Yes/no questionsYes/no questions are formed from indicative sentences by starting them
with a ‘yes/no’,1 as in 921 and 922. (See also example 955, page 361.)

Chapter 15Question FormationThere are two types of question: “yes/no” questions (15.1) and “ content”
questions (15.2).
   Questions are spoken with the same intonation as declaratives, but
there may be tone changes.","[382, 383]"

a-kha (aca) (yh-doubt aca) is used to ask regarding something that the
    speaker heard, asking for confirmation and simultaneusly indicating
    disapproval or incredulity, as in 823. (See also example 785, page

"12.1      ConjunctionsBora has no word like English and. The conjunction o f nominals is
achieved by means of suffixes or by a “ summation” word as discussed in
section 7.6.
    There are two disjunctive morphemes, ami ‘or’ and mitjha ‘or’, which
to our knowledge are entirely interchangable. They are used to ask which
of two alternatives is correct, occurring between the clauses that express
the alternatives, as in the following examples:
(818) iA u majchoó mitya tsa u majchóityune?
     a m maxf ho-ó-? mitjha teha? m max$hó-i-tjhm-nè
     yh you eat-fut-(t) or  not you eat-fut-neg-(n)a

Examples 820 and 821 show that much o f the second clause may be
ellipsed:

They are never part of a sentence.1
 uix ( uj) ~ hm?m:: (juhuu) expresses surprise
 ^hix (chfj) ~ $4:: (chff) expresses surprise or admiration
 pó:o: (n ó ó o o ) expresses happiness
    Many other interjections are used in the interaction between people:
to get another’s attention, to answer, or to indicate a reaction. A few of
the more common follow:
 éhè (é je ) calls attention to look at something (like English ‘Look!’)
 ahm (a ju ) calls attention to receive something given (like English ‘Here!
      Take it!’)
 aax (a a j) answers a call or indicates a question (like English ‘Yes, what do
      you want?’)
 hmmhmx (juujuj) ~ hmm (juu) ~ uiui ( uu) indicates agreement (like En­
      glish OK.)
 maa?mmx (m aah u u j) indicates that one does not know (like English ‘I
      don’t know!’)
 hm:m (juuu) indicates incredulity (like English ‘I can’tbelieve it!’12.3        ParticlesThe PARTICLES listed below call attention, express surprise, ask permis­
sion, and so forth. In contrast to the interjections discussed in section
12.2, the particles are sentence constituents.","[353, 354]"

    Example 959 begins “ I was gladdend” (not included in 959), followed
by an adverbial clause of the sort discussed in section 17.4.2. The verb of
this clause is “teil,” which has an object complement expressing what was
told. (The subject o f the complement clause is the noun phrase “ those to
whom I taught the truth.”) The structure o f 959 is given in figure 16.4:

   An object complement may be an embedded content question, as in
the subordinate clause beginning with mm-:pè-khé ‘whom’ in 960 and with
mm-?a ‘who’ in 961. Embedded alternative questions are expressed using
a conditional clause, as in 973.

-© thm (-tu) ‘negative’; see section 13.2. The other two are glossed (0) and
(event). This section deals with the contrast between these two.
   (0) represents a thing, that is, an inanimate object that typically persists
over time (and can be localized in space). By contrast, an event typically                             ©2012 SIL International ®

(event) are used following subordinate verbs, so the verb’s initial syllable
bears high tone. However, the former imposes a low tone on its host’s
penult while the latter does not:                                    #ü...crane(0) (thing)
                                    #a...aone             (event)This difference is visible only on verbs that have three or more syllables,6
as in 962, in which the tone of the verb’s penult (/pa/) correlates with
whether the clause bearing -ne refers to an object (962a) or an event

(543) a:nm     teha-hmkhó:-?i (A a n u tsa ju cóó h i.) ‘This one (SgM)
      this.SgM come-now-(t)                              has now come.’
They may also be used to answer a question. For example, the question in
544a could be answered by 544b:
(544) a. khia ti-:piè     Q K ia d ifb ye?) ‘Where is he?’
         where that-(SgM)                    (lit. ‘Where he?’)        b. a:nm:        (A a n u u .) ‘He is here.’
           this.SgM
8.4.2       Inanimate demonstrative pronounsInanimate demonstrative pronouns are not specified for gender; they are
third person and may be singular, dual or plural. These are formed by
adding a classifier to i- ‘demonstrative proximate’ e(:)- ‘medial’ and &-
‘distal’. For example, see é-xphi in 545 and é?-kpa: in 546:
(545) tehi-xphi   é-xphi     (tsfjpi é jp i)‘another’s person
      other-(SgM) that-(SgM)                     (or animal)’(546) ...dihnéw aa M o itsee éh w aa, Erfa éhw aa...
         [ti?pé-kpa:] [moitehée é?-kpa:]      [èrïa é?-kpa:]
          your-(slab) Moses that-(slab) Elijah that-(shelter)
        ‘ ...your shelter, Moses’ shelter, Elijah’s shelter...’    Any o f the classifiers can be used in this way. Table 8.4 illustrates
this for -nè ~ -pè ‘thing’, -kpa ‘slab, plank, table, bench, machete, knife
and similar things’, and -?a:mi ‘leaf, paper, book, bill, and similar things’.
The proximate, medial, and distal demonstratives are given as singular,
dual (with -:khm ‘duin’), and plural (with -(?)hi ‘plural’). Note that, with
perhaps a few exceptions, the medial and distal differ by the tone of the
second syllable: low for medial and high for distal.","[274, 275]"

animate direct object:                           ©2012 SIL International ®
352                                          CHAPTER 15. QUESTION FORMATION
(930) ïMuubeké u tsivahi?
      mm-:pè-khé         m tehi§a-?i                     ‘Whom (SgM)
      WH-(SgM)-objAn.£? you bring-(t)                     do you bring?’
As stated above, the interrogative phrase generally ends with a high tone
(glossed “ .£?”.) There are two cases where this is not so. First, mm?a ‘who’
never bears a final high tone. Second, in an embedded question (discussed
on page 364) the interrogative word ends with a low tone.
    When used as the subject of a clause, the forms that end in /e/ change
this to a high tone /a/, as shown in 931 and illustrated in 932.
(931)    NO NSU BJECT                 SU BJECT
        mm:pè (muube) — > mm:pa (muuba) ‘who (SgM)’
        mrn:fÈ (muulle) — > mm:$a (muulla) ‘who (SgF)’
        mm:thè (muute) — > mm:tha (muuta) ‘who (AnPl)’(932) ïMuuba tsaahif?
      mm-:pa      teha:-?ii              ‘Who (SgM) comes?’
      WH-(SgM).<? come-(t)
Likewise, when the interrogative phrase is an object terminated with the
animate object suffix, the form is -kha rather than -khe; for example:
(933) ïMuca u tsivahi?
      mm-kha       m tehi§a-?i                 ‘Whom (Sg/Du/Pl) are
      WH-objAn.i? you bring-(t)                 you bringing?’
These two facts— the final high tone and the vowel change— are evidence
of an interrogative suffix that ( 1) has a @ to be docked on its host’s final
syllable, and ( 2) causes the change o f /e/ to /a/.2
    The interrogative pronouns o f table 15.4 ask for the identification of
the person or animal with respect to some group (in the same way that
which does in English). When used in a question, the final syllable of the
interrogative phrase bears high tone but (unlike the forms in table 15.3)
do not change /e/ to /a/. (These interrogative pronouns are also used in
embedded questions; see examples 960 and 961, page 364.)   Table 15.4 Animate interrogative pronouns formed with ca- ‘which’

In 1194b, the direct object ‘manioc’ is attached to the verb ‘we peel’ and
then this phrase is attached t o ‘we wash’. ; hence [[DO s-V] s-V]. In 1194c,
on the other hand, the attachment of ‘manioc’ is deferred until ‘we peel

happened a long time ago (at least some months ago). The -phe form is
illustrated in 275a and 276a. The -O ^ form (1) imposes a high tone on
the preceeding syllable and (2) forms an additional syllable that bears low
tone, the vowel of which is the same as the preceding vowel; see examples
275b and 276b:

        a. ‘ My brother is about to go.’

be simply an interrogative pronoun (as described below). For example,
923 is a simple statement and 924 is a question, in which the interrogative
pronoun mm?a ‘who’ is used as the subject:
(923) 0 tsaa améjutu.
      0 teha:-?  améhm-thm                      ‘I come from down river.’

    Interrogative phrases are formed from the roots and stems of table 15.1:                           Table 15.1 The interrogative roots

  In 934 the interrogative pronoun is the direct object; because it is ani­
mate it bears -© khe ‘objAn’:
(934) ïCaatyétsikyé u tsivahi?
      kha:-tjhétehi-kjhé    m tehi§a-?i                      ‘Which two (DuM) are
      which-(DuM)-objAn.^? you bring-(t)                      you bringing?’In 935 the interrogative pronoun takes -(?)ti (-hdi) ‘benefactive’ because it
is animate:
(935) iCaabyedf(tyu) u ihjyuvahi?
      kha-:piè-tf-(tjhm)       m i?hjm§a-?i
      which-(SgM) -anim-sou.i? you speak-(t)
      ‘About which one (SgM) o f them are you talking?’
15.2.2       Inanimate interrogative pronouns
Inanimate interrogative pronouns are third person and may be singular,
dual, or plural. They do not reflect gender. There are two roots. First, i:-
‘what’ is used to ask for the identity o f one or more things. It is always
followed by -nè (0), presumably because the one who asks does not know
what it is and thus cannot use a more specific classifier.3
(936) a. ï:-na          (++na)        ‘what (sg)’
         what-(0).i?
      b. £-nè-:khm      (tn e e c u ) ‘what (du)’

      c. £-nè-?hi       (+nehj+) ‘what’ (p l)’
         what-(0)-pl.^?
   When used as a subject (as in 937), as direct object (as in 938), or as
predicate complement (as in 939), ï:né changes to ï:na

   Adverbial subordinate clauses are discussed in chapter 17. There are
various types of nominal subordinate clauses. Relative clauses are dis­
cussed in chapter 18. Complements are dealt with here in section 16.2:
subject complements in section 16.2.1 and object complements in section
16.2.2.
   The first syllable o f the verb of a subordinate clause bears high tone,
represented here by S over the vowel. For example, compare 944a, a
subordinate clause headed by a verb with the initial high tone, with 944b,

Authorship
Wesley Thiesen, who— along with his wife Eva— worked intimately with
the Bora people from 1952 to 1998, drafted a grammar sketch o f Bora
in Spanish but for the Bora people, to be included in the Bora dictionary
(Thiesen & Thiesen 1998). In response to questions from David Weber (as
linguistic consultant) this sketch grew to the point that it was decided that
it should be published as a separate volume (Thiesen 1996).2
    Weber began transforming one of the intermediate Spanish versions
into a more linguistically oriented English document, raising more ques­
tions, exploring deeper linguistic issues, dividing examples into mor-
phemes and glossing them, and refining analyses. The analysis of tone
was particularly difficult, but we are now satisfied that the analysis given
in this volume gives reasonable coverage, although there are still a few
unresolved issues.3
   : An earlier draft o f this grammar was circulated in 1998 and another in 2000. The content
has not changed much since the 2000 draft. Publication has been delayed a decade for
w ork-related reasons beyond the authors' control.
   2Unless otherwise indicated, references to Thiesen are to W esley Thiesen.
   3T o study the Bora tone system, Thiesen (circa 1954) identified 18 verbs that instantiated
the range o f tonal behaviors. He elicited each verb in 165 frames consisting m ostly o f differ­
ent suffix combinations. He also identified 15 animate and 15 inanimate nouns. He elicited
each animate noun in 28 frames and each inanimate noun in 31 frames. Although some o f
the root-fram e com binations w ere not possible, over 3850 words w ere elicited.
  T o facilitate seeing patterns o f tone, he made exhaustive charts representing just tone and
length, i.e., suppressing the phonological segments. For the verbs, this resulted in what                             ©2012 SIL International ®

    The list of classifiers in appendix E was translated from a draft of
(Thiesen & Thiesen 1998). The description of Bora kinship terms in ap­
pendix F was written by Thiesen in 1964 and later published as (Thiesen
1975b). The current version was revised with Weber in 1996. The texts
included in appendix G were provided by Bora individuals. Thiesen pro-
vided the glosses and translations.","[25, 26]"

    Second, pronouns like those o f table 15.5 are used to ask for the iden-

‘which’, some classifier, and optionally a pluralizer: -:khm ‘duin’ or -(?)hi
‘plural’. The classifiers used in table 15.5 are -ne, which refers to things
in general (not specified), -mi, which refers to canoes, cars, airplanes and
other means of transport, and -hi, which refers to disk-like things (includ-
ing coins, pills, buttons, the earth, the sky,...).","[387, 388]"
"R E L A T IV E C L A U S E S :
In 1030, page 392, the subject of the relative clause, indicated by i ‘self’,
is coreferential with the subject of the main clause.
   In 539, the three cases o f i ‘self’ refer to the subject o f the main clause.
The two that are underlined indicate the subjects o f subordinate clauses;
the other (in the first word) is part of a possessive pronoun:

         ‘Having caused the loss of his own, he wants to get yours.’    We now turn to cases in which the anaphor is the modifier (possessor)
in a genitive construction. In 540a the anaphor i ‘self’ modifies (possesses)

‘house’ and refers to the sentence’s subject (John). By contrast, in 540b
the personal pronoun ti-:pie must refer to someone outside o f this domain,
that is, someone other than John:
(5 4 0 ) a. Jóaa p ee ihjyavu.
      b. Jóaa p éé dffbyé ja vu .
                        a. i?        hja-§m

                           that-(SgM) house-goal      a. ‘John* went to his* house.’
      b. ‘Johnj went to hisj house, (i = j ) ’And i ‘self’ behaves as an anaphor when it is part of a free possessive
pronoun. For example, i?pe ‘self’s (thing)’ must refer to something pos­
sessed by the referent of a nearby expression,one close enough to bind
the anaphor. In 564, page 248, it refers to the sentence’s subject.
   Although i ‘self’ behaves like a typical anaphor in the majority of cases,
some cases are unexpected. For example, in 541 it refers to the subject of
the sentence, but that subject is outside o f the immediate clause o f the
anaphor:
(541) Jóaa w aajacu foohffbye ds+j+véne.
      hóaaj kpa:hakhm-? [ï* © (3:?i-:piè  teihï^é ]-nè
      John know-(t)      self   dog-(SgM) die       -(0)
      ‘John* knows that his* dog died.’Example 542 is perhaps even more problematic. Generally anaphors must
be coreferential to a noun phrase that is in a structurally more prominent
position. However, in 542 i refers from within the subject to the direct
object, which presumably is not more prominent:(542) Io o h ffb ye Jóaake thdóhi.
      1 © (3:?i-:piè hóa:-khè   ï?tó-?i              ‘John*’s dog bit himj.’
      self dog-(SgM) John-objAn bite-(t)
Technically, the binding expression should c-command the anaphor. Fur­
ther, subjects generally c-command objects, but objects do not c-command
subjects. This may be evidence that Bora has a “ flat” structure, one lacking
a verb phrase. However, this raises other questions beyond the scope of
this grammar. We leave the question as an outstanding research issue.","[272, 273]"

10.2.3     Objects as cliticized classifiersWhen a clause has a preverbal subject, the direct object may occur as a
classifier cliticized to the verb, displacing the -(0 0 ?ï (t) that normally

(thematic), as when responding to a question about the object. Perhaps
these are not sentences, but relative clauses (in elliptical responses). As
such, the high tone on the first syllable o f each verb marks the clause as
subordinate.","[308, 309]"

However, in single word responses to questions the vowel is long, as in
530:
(530)a. o:-khè (O ó k e.) ‘To me.’
     b. mè:-khè (Meéke.) ‘To us (in.).’
8.1.2 The use of personal pronounsFirst and second person pronouns are used to refer to the speaker(s) and
hearer(s) as needed. Third person pronouns are used either to “point” to a
referent in the external context or to establish coreference with another
referring expression, usually one that has been previously established.
This latter use o f pronouns competes with two alternatives: (1) with the
anaphor i ‘self’, and (2) with the use of a classifier subject to refer to the
subject. We comment briefly on these in turn.
    First, i ‘self’ is an anaphor, so must be bound within a very local domain
(as discussed further in section 8.3) while the personal pronouns must not
be bound within that domain. For example, consider 531, the structure
o f which is represented in figure 8.1. The possessor in the subordinate
clause is ti-:piè (that-(SgM)) and it is bound from outside o f the subordinate
clause. (It could refer to the speaker’s brother or any other male other
than the speaker himself.) If instead it were i ‘self’, as in 1157, page 439,
it would be bound by the subject o f its clause and thus refer to “ me” rather
than to John.4

7. Bora’s tone system seems too complex. A reader commented, “You can’t
   be right. It is too complicated. How would children learn it?”
   We agree that our description— and the analysis implicit in it— are too
   complicated. Of course, the complexity of the facts themselves cannot
   be reduced. (Indeed, further study will undoubtedly bring to light more
   complexities.) The challenge, therefore, is to find analyses that reduce
   the complexity.
8. Bora— it seems— has no stress system aside from the system o f tone:
   there do not seem to be stressed versus unstressed syllables, only high
   tone versus low tone syllables. In basic design, the Bora tone system
   is not unlike the accentual system o f Lithuanian described by Kensto-
   wicz (1994:584ff.). We do not discount the possibility that Bora’s tone
   system is a stress system implemented on tone. Kenstowicz (1994)
   says that Milner proposes such an analysis for Winnebago; Kensto­
   wicz writes (p. 595) “The accent is interpreted as high tone” and (p.
   596) “ The accent in Winnebago is apparently realized tonally (Milner
   1979)”. (Consult Kenstowicz (1994) for references.)
9. Bora drum communication raises various intriguing questions: Given
   that there is relatively little lexical tone, why is it possible at all? What
   is the range o f messages that can be communicated? To what extent
   does it depend on conventional frames?
10. Across Bora clans there are small dialect differences, most promi-
   nently, with regard to palatalization. There are differences in tone.
   This merits further study.
   A language spoken to the north in Colombia, Muinane, is closely related
   to Bora. According to Mike Maxwell (personal communication) it has
   a pitch-accent system: very roughly, words begin with some number of
   high tone syllables and are thereafter followed by low tone syllables.
   Perhaps this is the result o f the collapse of a system like that of Bora.
   Tone has not been sufficiently studied in other members of the Witotoan
   family such as Witoto and Ocaina.
   Aschmann (1993) has done an admirable job of reconstructing the seg-
   mental phonology of Witotoan. However, reconstructing the system of
   tone is an outstanding challenge.","[131, 132]"

For example, if someone points out a bird to a person who has trouble
seeing it, then that person might challenge the first with 795, which is as
though to say “Where in the world is it; I don’t see anything!”
           mm-?tehi-?aha     QMuhtsfhaja?) '(7 9 5 )                     (jK fd h c ja ? )   | ,W here?! Cincredulous3'

If someone says (pointing to a group) “ He did it.” someone who cannot
identify the referent could respond with 796:
(796) kha-:pié-?aha      QCaabyéhaja?) ‘Which one?’
      which-(SgM)-verify
In response to something incredible one can respond with 797:
(797) mm-?tm-ra-?aha         (jMuhdurahaja!) ‘How could that be!’
      WH- (like) -frs-verify

11.2.9       -hde ‘be able’-?te ‘be able’ indicates that its host’s referent is able to do the action indi­
cated by the verb:
(803)ó-^tè ó max$ho-ó-?i (Óhde ó majchoóhi.) ‘I can eat it.’
      I-able I eat-fut-(t)(804)        Óréhdéiikyéca ó méénuuhi.

        I-only-able-be-affirm I do-fut-(t)        do it I w ill!’
It can also be used to indicate permission, as in 805:
(805) Anéhde waaca dipye.
      ané-^tè      kpa:-kha      ti-pihè               ‘O.K., then,
      concede-able permit-affirm youlmp-go           you may go.’
11.2.10        -mei ‘pity’-mei (-mei) ‘pity’ indicates compassion or pity. For example:
(806) ti-ip’è-méi     (dnbyeméi) ‘poor thing (SgM )!’
      that-(SgM)-pity(807) Ts++méneméi aakityé fyé fjcyaabe.

        ‘The poor child feil, being alone.’
11.2.11        -jtane ‘exclude’-xthane (-jtane) ‘exclude’ indicates that an action is done without taking
into consideration another person or thing. For example:
(808) Diityéjtane ds+tneébe.
      ti:-tjhé-xthanè     tei:nè-:pè       ‘He ran leaving
      that-(AnPl)-exclude run-(SgM)         them behind.’(809) Aamye majchó ajyujtane.

11.2.12       -véj+u ‘similar to’-^éhirn (-véj+u) ‘similar to’ indicates similarity or likeness. For example:
(810)kpa?aró-§éhïm oó (Waharóvéj+u oó.) ‘I am like my mother.’
      mother-similar I
11.2.13       The combination -i-ro ‘contrary’The combination o f -i ‘projected time’ and -ro ~ -jo ‘frustrative, contra­
expectation’ is cliticized to noun phrases to indicate that some situation
is contrary to what one expects, what one might want, what is likely to
happen, and so forth. For example, 811 runs contrary to the expectation
that a singular masculine being would be present:
(811)kha-:pié-i-jo       QCaabyéiyo?) ‘Which one (SgM)?’
     which- (SgM) -PT-frs
Examples 812-817 run contrary to the expectation that the person or ob­
ject in question would be present:

328                                               CHAPTER 13. NEGATION
13.3.1     -jt+va with verbsWith verbs, -hi:(§a) ‘deny’ imposes a low tone on its host’s final syl­
lable. Further, the host’s initial syllable must bear high tone (in the
same way as -© thm ‘neg’; see section 3.10.) Thus, the form for verbs
is: # @ ...- © h i:(a ).
   When someone is accused o f doing something bad, he can emphatically
deny this by saying:
(848) o me:nm-:pè-hi:§a (0 méénuubej++va.) ‘I did NO T do it!’
      I do-(SgM)-deny
Note that— contrary to the PREVERBAL SUBJECT CONSTRAINT, page
129)— there seem to be two subjects in 848: the preverbal o ‘I’ and the
postverbal classifier -©:pe (SgM). However, this is not the case if its
structure is as in 849, where the clause is subordinate:
(849) [o mernra ]-:pè   [v hi:§a ]
       I do      -(SgM)    deny
This structure not only resolves the conflict with the PREVERBAL SUBJECT
CONSTRAINT, it also accounts for the verb’s initial high tone (since the
initial syllable o f the verb o f a subordinate clause always bears a high
tone).
    The question in 850a could be answered by either 850b or c. The
difference is that 850b is more emphatic than 850c:
(850) a. iA tsuuca dftyaaba majchójucóó?
      b. Tsahai; majchóllej++va.
      c. Tsahai dille majchotune.      a. a tehm:kha ti   (    tjha:pa max$hó-hmkhó:
         yh already your      wife eat-now      b. teha?a-i; max$hó-$è-hi:§a
         not-PT eat-(SgF)-deny      c. teha?a-i ti-^è    max$ho-thm-nè

      b. ‘Not yet; she has not eaten.’
      c. ‘ She has not yet eaten.’
   Likewise, the first sentence in 851 may be followed by either 851a or
851b; the former is more emphatic than the latter:                             ©2012 SIL International ®

stood that the referents o f the subject caused each other to do the action
indicated by the verb; for example:   17In many cases the causative suffix has /o/, whereas in 263 and 257 it has /a/. This
reflects the fact that most speakers o f the Ineje dialect apply a rule w h ereby -teko becomes

verb. For example, in answer to the question in 1062, one could answer
with 1063. (See also examples 277 and 278, page 152.)

Appendix BSpeculations on Diachronie
ProcessesThe following are speculations about how some forms may have developed
from earlier stages of the language:
1. Two suffixes have the form            One is glossed as ‘become’ (as in
   137); the other is glossed as ‘singular intransitive (sin)’ (as in 242).
   These are at least cognate; perhaps they are a single morpheme with
   two uses.
2. imipax$ho ‘fix’ may derive from *imi-pa-$ho (good-verbalizer-caus).
   Likewise, i?hjm§a ‘talk’ may derive from *i?hm-§a mouth-verbalizer and
   mxkha§a ‘become fat’ from *mxkha-§a- fat-verbalizer.
3. imihjm ‘happy’ may derive from *imi-hjm (good-speech); e.g., imihjm-
   :§é-mè ‘they became very happy’.
4. ïmi^’é- ‘finish’ may derive from imi-^ié- (good-verbalizer). (However
   ïmi^’é- is a transitive verb, whereas      generally derives intransitive
   verbs.)
5. i kpahjamm ‘his clothes’ may derive from i kpa-ha-mm (self (slab)-
   (shelter)-pl), perhaps because the body is perceived as roughly slab-
   shaped (like a plank).
6. Perhaps the /pa/ of -khopa ‘ augment’ is cognate with pha- ‘all, big’.
7. maxf ho ‘eat (bread)’ may derive from *mai-teho- (bread-cause), with the
   /*i/ palatalizing the /ts/. Support for this is found in the word ma?o
   ‘cassava bread’.
8. phi:^iè ‘grow’ may derive from phi-:§e. The *phi would have been ei­
   ther ‘body’ or ‘big’; the *-:§£ would have been either the verbalizer
                       ©2012 SIL Int4flrïktional ®
412              APPENDIX B. SPECULATIONS ON DIACHRONIC PROCESSES
    ‘become’ or ‘sin’ (which, as suggested above, may have been the same
    morpheme).
9. -na:akha ‘meanwhile’ may derive from *-ne-a:kha ( ( 0} -realize). This may
   be due to either a historical or a morphophonemic process.
10. -? ixkjha1 ‘be’ forms a compound tense indicating imperfective aspect.
   It is frequently interpreted as habitual. It is now bound but was un-
   doubtedly free at some prior stage of the language.
11. -tehi (not palatalized) ~ -^hi (palatalized) (place} and -?m$e (yonder}
   ~      (root) ‘yonder, over there’ are probably cognate.
12. Consider the requirement that, when -§m ‘goal’ follows an animate
   phrase, the phrase must bear the suffix -(?)ti ‘animate’, as in example
   656, page 276. This suffix, which now appears to mark animacy, may
   have arisen from the pronoun ti ‘that’ in locational uses o f the genitive
   construction along the lines of      in example 660, page 276.
13. tehi:me ‘children’ may derive from tehi:-me (baby-ANPL) where tehi:- is
   cognate with the classifier -tehi (baby}.
14. The /hm/ o f        Ohmkho: ‘now, already; focus’ may be cognate with
   the /hm/ o f -Ohm-x ‘quick-vocative’.
15. -?i (t}, the tracé left when a subject is moved to before the verb, may
   be cognate with i ‘self’.
16. mi: ‘two’ may be cognate with -mm ‘dual’ as in -mmtehi (DuM} and
   -mmphi (DuF}.
17. -naa(:kha) ‘while’ (discussed in section 17.3 may be derived from -ne
   (event} and the adverbial clitic -ha(:ca) ‘realize’ (listed in 11.2).
18. The pronoun mmm ‘indefinite animate singular’ discussed in section
   14.3.2 may be cognate with -mm ‘plAn’.
19. The suffix - O O teha ‘each’ is probably cognate with the root teha- ‘one’.
20. See footnote 11, page 106, regarding probable source of certain verbs
   often used in compounds.
21. See chapter 15, footnote 2, regarding the possible historical develop-
   ment o f an interrogative suffix that docks a high tone on the host’s final
   syllable and causes the final vowel to change from /e/ to /a/.","[439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446]"

17.2.1 “Normal” conditional clauses“ Normal” conditional adverbial clauses are formed with -?ah$hi:(hjm) (-
hajchnjyu) ‘i f ’. These indicate that the event o f the main clause depends
on that o f the subordinate clause. Sentence finally -?ax$hi:hjm (-h ajch n jyu )
is used, as in 971, and sentence medially -?ax^hi: (-h a jc h n ) is used, as in
972.2

17.2.2        Counterfactual conditional clausesCounterfactual conditional clauses are formed with -kh®a (-ca) ‘if
(contrary-to-fact)’ (CF). Their underlying assumptions are: (1) the truth of
the main clause depends crucially3 on the truth o f the conditional clause,
(2) the conditional clause is false, and (3) therefore the main clause is
false.
    The verb of the main clause always bears -i ‘future’ and -ra ~ -ro ‘frus­
trative, contraexpectation’.4 For example:
(974) U majchoca tsuuca u ts+jpanuiyahi.
        [m maxtfho 1-kha tehm:kha m tehixphanm-i-ja-?i
         you eat       -CF already you be.strong-fut-frs-(t)
       ‘ If you had eaten, you would now be strong.’(975) Teene u majchótuca tsa u chéméftyuró(ne).
        [thè:-nè m max$hó-thm 1-kha
         that-(0) you eat-neg  -CF       teha? m $hémé-i-tjhm-ró-(nè)
       not you be.ill-fut-neg-frs-(n)
       ‘If you had not eaten that, you would not have taken ill.’(976) lA ca iiïmütuca meke p+aabóiyóne?
       a-kha      [i   i:mm-thm     1-kha
       ques-doubt self be.savory-neg -CF       mè-khè       phia:pó-i-jó-nè
       SAP-objAn help-fut-frs-(0)
       ‘If it were not savory, would it help us?’   Note that the order of the main and subordinate clauses is reversed in
977:
   3This is generally a causal dependence.
   4This requirem ent— that the main verb bear both the future and the frustrative (contra­
expectation) suffixes— negates the future possibility o f the event o f the main clause, thereby
givin g the counterfactual meaning.","[405, 406]"
"   Discussion follows. However, we will leave open various questions
about the phonemic status of certain sounds: (1) Which palatalized con­
sonants are allophones o f the corresponding nonpalatalized consonant?
Some instances are probably allophones while others are phonemes in
their own right. (2) Is [?] an allophone o f /?/, with which it is in com-
plementary distribution? (3) Is [x] an allophone o f /h/, with which it is in
complementary distribution?
/p/ (orthographic b) and /ph/ (orthographic p) differ by aspiration, as in
     the following pair:
      (19) a. phè:pè (peébe) ‘he goes’
           b. pé:pèé (béébeé) ‘the new one’
/t/ (orthographic d) and / tV (orthographic t) differ by aspiration, as in
      the following pair:
      (20) a. ta:$hi (daachi) ‘his son’
           b. t^a:$è (taalle) ‘ she cries’
/te/ (orthographic ds) and /teh/ (orthographic ts) differ by aspiration, as
      in the following pair:
       (21) a. te4tehïihï (ts+ts++j+) ‘white button’
            b. tei:teïhï (ds++ds+j+) ‘coin’

/$/ (orthographic II) and /$h/ (orthographic ch) differ by aspiration, as
     in the following pairs:
       (22) a. ^hémè:pè (chémeébe) ‘he is sick’
            b. $é:nè:pè (llééneébe) ‘he eats fruit’
     (23) a. i$hi: (fchii) ‘here’
          b. i$ii (flln) ‘his/her son’
/$h/ (orthographic ch) contrasts with /tjh/ (orthographic ty), as in 24:
     (24) a. aa^hi (aachi) ‘outside’
          b. a:tihè (aatye) ‘those’
/k/ (orthographic g) and /kh/ (orthographic c before a, o or u but k before
     e, i or +) differ by aspiration, as in 25:
     (25) a. ko:khómè     (goocóme) ‘they laugh’
          b. k^a?kmnmkho (cahgunuco) ‘cahuana (starch drink)’
          c. k4khi:hjè    (kfkijjye)     ‘bat’
/kp/ (orthographic w) is a voiceless labial-velar stop, as in 26:
       (26) a. kpa?aro         (waharo)        ‘mother’
            b. ó kpa:hakhm-?i (ó waajacuhi) ‘I know-(t)’
       There are interesting restrictions on /kp/ (w). First, it only occurs
       before /a/ or /m/ (u). Second, it never undergoes palatalization (see
       section 2.4.2). For example, we expect palatalization after /i/ but
       that does not happen with /kp/: imiwu imikpm ‘very good’. Third,
       generally neither /?/ (h) nor /V (j) (preaspiration) may precede /kp/,
     but a long vowel may, as in è:-kpa (that-(slab)) and imia:-kpa (proper-
     (slab)).                                                    _ _
/^/ (orthographic v) is a voiced labial fricative, as in 27:
     (27) a. ré§ó:§è-:pè (révóóveébe) ‘he turns around’
          b. §aha:§è      (vajaave)     ‘to become punctured’
/h/ (orthographic j ) may occur as the onset o f a syllable, at the beginning
     of a word, as in 28a, or in the middle of a word, as in 28b:
      (28) a. haa                             i]aa)      ‘house’
           b. kpa:hakhm (waajacu) ‘know’
/*/ (orthographic j ) is preaspiration. It occupies the coda o f the syllable
      before an aspirated consonant (see section 2.4.3), as in 29a, or it may
      be word final as in 29b:2
       (29) a. ma*fho                       (majcho)   ‘food’
            b. max$hóhmx (majchójuj) ‘eat (hurriedly)’
       /V in the syllable coda is pronounced with greater friction than is
       /h/ in the onset.
    2Since x is in com plem entary distribution w ith /h/ it m ight be considered an allophone
o f /h/.","[67, 68]"

(which, recall, generally precede the subject in Bora) as in 567. (The final
high tone in 567a and b is because they are questions.)

Chapter 9The Genitive ConstructionThe genitive construction joins two nouns or noun phrases into a single
noun phrase.                                [ nP NPmodifier      Nhead ]The meaning is generally that o f “ possession,” in which the first noun
(phrase) “ possesses” the second. (We often refer to the modifier as the
POSSESSOR and the head as the POSSESSED. The modifier (possessor) pre­
cedes the head (possessed) with the tones described in section 9.1. The
modifier may cliticize to the head or it may be a separate word (or phrase).","[282, 283, 284, 285]"

PrefaceThis book is intended as a baseline description o f the the Bora language.1
It makes both structural and functional claims. Most o f the description is
framed in terms of basic notions accepted across linguistic theories; occa-
sionally we make a theory-specific excursus.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

5.9.1      The present-past tenseThe unmarked tense of Bora verbs is present-past (realis). These do not
distinguish past (prior) events from present ones, that is events happening
at the time of speaking. Whether past or present is intended be inferred
from context. For example, in answer to “What is your brother doing?”
266 would be understood as ‘He is working’ but in answer to “What did
your brother do yesterday?” it would be understood as ‘He worked’:(266)kpakhimjèi-:piè (Wakimyenbye.)     «JJewraked’18'
     work-(SgM)                     1 ‘
Of course, the time reference may be made explicit by a time adverb, such
as i:hjm ‘yesterday’ in 267:
(267)                Tanahbe wakfmyef ifjyu.
        tha © pa?pè kpakhimjèi-? i:hjm       ‘My brother worked
        my    brother work-(t)   yesterday yesterday.’
5.9.2      The future tenseThe future tense indicates that the action, event or state indicated by the
verb will happen subsequent to the time o f speaking. Future tense is
marked by the addition o f the future morpheme at the position indicated
in figure 5.2, page 135. This morpheme has two forms, which are briefly
described and illustrated here; for further discussion see appendix D, page
429, item 1110.
     First, when a suffix other than - © © ?i (t) follows, the future morpheme
is -i.19 For example, consider 268b (in which -©$è (SgF) follows the future
suffix):
   19 This m orpheme and the “ projected tim e” clitic discussed in section 5.9.3.3 may be one
and the same m orpheme but w e treat them separately because -i ‘future’ occurs on ly on
verbs (a distributional d ifferen ce) and never has the additional syllable /:ki l è/ as does the
“ projected tim e” clitic (a form al difference).",[183]

1.6       ReligionRelatively little is known about traditional Bora religion. The chief,
Mibeco, said that the evil thunder god splits trees from top to bottom
with lightning, and then plants the life o f a new animal in the ground. In
this way, the wild and dangerous animals of the rain forest were created.
Many o f these animals, especially the jaguar, were believed to have spe­
cial powers, which could harm people, or which could protect a clan. If
the latter, the animal in question was not killed or eaten by members of
that clan, and the clan’s shaman claimed that that animal gave him spe­
cial power.13 The Bora did not worship such animals but respected them
for their powers. They made appeasement offerings to the spirits of some
animals. (This is also true o f one type o f tree, for which an offering was
made before it was cut down.)
    The shaman still follows these beliefs and employs the teeth of the
jaguar to adversely affect others: he is said to cause the swelling o f knee
joints, with an eventual, very painful death. Several deaths in 1953 were
attributed to such shamanistic practice.
    While most Bora no longer observe the practices of the traditional reli­
gion, they still have a great fear o f the shaman’s powers. The shaman was,
perhaps, the most powerful man in Bora culture. He was feared, and was
always paid for his assistance. Cultural change has diminished his power.
With medicines available at the Posta Medica or from outsiders, the people
call on the shaman less frequently.
    It was the custom in the old days for the shaman to assign babies a pro-
tective totem, usually one o f the following: dove, hummingbird, partridge,
parrot, stork, panguano, partridge, paca, agouti.14 Each person expected to
receive help from his totem. This naming practice and belief has declined
due to the conversion o f many Bora people to Christianity.
    In 1984 or 1985 a six-year-old boy was caught in the claws o f a jaguar
of the type known as colorado.15 When the father came running with his
shotgun, the jaguar was distracted, enabling the boy to get away. The
father fired his only shell, but missed. The jaguar ran a short way off. After  13Several years ago a man livin g at the mouth o f the Sumun River was reported to have
claim ed ownership o f the huangana, the peccary lacking the w hite stripe across its shoulder.
He claim ed to be able to talk to them when they came to his house. He demanded that
hunters pay him when they killed one, or otherwise suffer the consequences.
   14These animals w ere regarded as good, w h ile the deer, collared peccary (sajino), white-
lipped peccary (huangana), tapir (sachavaca), ow l, bat, and certain other animals w ere re­
garded as evil. The shaman also w orked w ith the pow er o f the evil animals.
  15This is about tw o feet high, four feet long, o f a reddish brow n color (w ithou t spots).","[52, 53]"

   However, bisyllabic hosts unexpectedly bear a low tone on their final
   syllable. (It is as though the suffix’s © , having been blocked by the
   subordination tone, docks on the host’s final syllable.) See the following
   chart and the examples that follow it.

In the index, entries are ordered according to the English alphabet. Bora
words are written according to the Bora writing system (the “ practical
orthography”) to facilitate finding them in alphabetical order.
EXAMPLES:
Examples generally present four types of information. The position of
these parts varies in the interest o f saving space. (1) The Bora example is
written in a phonetic or phonemic form using the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA). (2) The example is also written in the Bora writing
system, with this sort o f font (sans serif). This is sometimes located
above the phonetic / phonemic representation and sometimes following
the phonetic / phonemic form (in parentheses). (3) A
morpheme-by-morpheme gloss is given either below the Bora example or
in parentheses following it. (4) A free translation follows, either on a line
below the morpheme-by-morpheme text or following it at the end o f the
line.
BORA C ITATIO N FORMS:
(a) Words given “ in isolation” (i.e., without any preceding or following
text) may meet the conditions for the application of either PLTS or FLTS.
If so, the isolation form will be the output o f the rule (which is how it
would be pronounced in isolation). (b) Sometimes the phonetic /
phonemic representation of words, roots, affixes,...make lexically                            ©2012 SIL International ®

marked tones explicit, as discussed below, while omitting the tones of
other syllables. (c) When verbs are cited, the phonetic / phonemic
representation may make lexically marked tones explicit whereas the
orthographic form gives the nonfinite form; see section 4.1, page 100,
especially figure 4.1. For example, akpakhumrn (awacunu) ‘to yawn’.
PHRASE MARKERS:
Phrase markers ( “ trees”) with which structure is represented are
intended as suggestive, neither definitive nor what would might be
expected for any particular theoretic perspective. Some sentences are
given with a rather flat structure. This makes it easier to deal with Bora’s
relatively free word order, but at the cost o f sometimes obscuring
subcategorization relationships. For example, see the tree given for
example 662, page 277. Some affixes are treated as separate syntactic
constituents; for example, case markers are treated as postpositions.
TONE DERIVATIONS:
The Bora forms in tone derivations are written as Bora people normally
read and write their language. Tone derivations use the font with
which this sentence is written.
LETTERS REPRESENTING USES OF TONE:
We sometimes use v to highlight a high tone and v to highlight a low
tone. Further, to help the reader keep track of different uses o f tone, we
sometimes indicate the use by writing a small letter over the vowel.
These letters are as follows:
              LETTER   TONE                USE

   Another case is that o f mï-nè transport-(0) ‘canoe’. By itself, the root
   mi- does not refer to a canoe; rather, it means quite generally ‘trans­
   portation’. However, it does refer to a canoe when combined with -nè
   (0), which (1) satisfies the structural requirement for a head, and (2) de­
   notes a class o f objects, thus enabling the phrase to refer.12
5. It might be possible to formulate an argument against the claim that
   classifiers head their phrases based on the remarkable behavior of clas­
   sifiers with numeral phrases.
   When a numeral phrase is used to quantify a noun, that noun must agree
   in animacy, gender and number. For example, consider 478, page 218.
   The phrase that means ‘six’ ends with an animate, singular, masculine
   classifier because ‘ six’ is literally ‘one from this hand’. When this phrase
   quantifies a noun (phrase), it must agree in animacy, number and gen­
   der. Thus, in ‘six dogs’— contrary to what one might expect— ‘dogs’ is
   marked as singular and masculine. See section 7.7.2 for further discus-
   sion. However, this lends further support for the claim that classifiers
   head their phrases. What matters are the features of the the numeral
   phrase and the noun, which are precisely the features of the classifiers
   with which each ends. That is, the classifiers determine the features of
   their phrase, even though these features do not reflect the semantics of
   the expression.
    To conclude this section (6.3), it should be clear that Bora classifiers
are eminently nominal. Here we have made a stronger claim: that Bora
classifiers are nouns. By doing so, it follows that Bora classifiers should
share the major properties o f nouns: the types o f meanings they encode,
the grammatical functions they may have, their distribution/use, and so
forth. Indeed, they do except that they have a more restricted distribu­
tion than other nouns. And this restricted distribution is due to a simple
property: that they are bound.
    Based on the claim that Bora classifiers are nouns, it seems reasonable
to think that what have been called “ classifiers” in Bora are not really
such, but simply a subclass o f nouns. We will not try to resolve this issue
here because the answer depends on whether one believes in universal
category definitions or that ultimately each category must be defined for
each language.","[221, 222]"

it is embedded bears -ne (0). (The tone o f the proclitics is explained in

writes (Langacker 1991:183):
       Conceptually, objects and interactions present a maxim al contrast, having op-
       posite values for such properties as dom ain o f instantiation (space vs. tim e),
       essential constituent (substance vs. energy transfer), and the possibility o f
       conceptualizing one independently o f the other (autonomous vs. dependent).
       Physical objects and energetic interactions provide the respective prototypes
       for the noun and verb categories, w hich likew ise represent a polar opposition

Chapter 10Case and Grammatical
RelationsCase marking suffixes indicate the role o f a noun phrase (or subordinate
clause) with respect to the clause within which it occurs. Bora has the
following case markers: -0 ‘nominative’ for subjects ( 10.1), -khe ~ 0 (with
animate and inanimate phrases, respectively) ‘direct object’ ( 10.2),
‘goal’ or ‘theme’ (10.3), -thm ‘source’ (10.4), -fi ‘inanimate obliques’ (10.5),
-ma ‘with’ (10.6), and -$i:?è ‘motive’ (10.7). In addition to these, there are
two “ pseudo-cases”: -?tm ‘comparative’ (10.8) and -x ‘vocative’ (10.9).
    Some of the case-marking alternatives are illustrated in 625. 625a has
a singular transitive verb whereas 625b-d have an intransitive verb.

10.1        SubjectSubjects are not marked for case; that is, the nominative is unmarked. (An
exception is discussed below.) Subjects are recognized by the absence of
another case marker, by their position in the sentence, or by the classifier
suffixed to the verb.
   There are three possible patterns for the subject and predicate, as rep­
resented in 626a, b, and d:(626) a.    ( N   P sub je c t)     [p r e d ic a te       '   '         ^ (j)      b *   [p r e d ic a te   . . . V e r b ] - c l a s s i f i e r s u b je c t   (   @ N P s u b je c t )      c.    NPsubject [predicate •**verb]-[classifiersubject]

First, as represented in 626a, the subject may be a noun phrase preceding
the verb, as in as in 627-629. In this case the verb is followed by - © 0 ? ï
(t) or, when negative, by -(00 nG (n) as ïn 837, page 326. This order is
the one most commonly used to introducé a referent into the discourse.","[300, 301, 302]"

Consider 86 (from example 769 on page 308). In 86a, which has a direct
quote, /nè-:pè/ ‘he said’ ends a phonological phrase, and thus undergoes
PLTS. By contrast, 86b has an indirect quote, so the phonological phrase
continues after /nè-:pè/; in this case PLTS does not apply because its con-
ditions are not met:
(86) a. Oke neebe, “ Péjcore ...” .
     b. Oke neebe péjcore ....
     a. okhè nèépè phéxkhorè ‘He said to me, “ Tomorrow...”
     b. okhè nè:pè phéxkhorè ‘He told me that tomorrow...’The singular masculine pronoun /ti:pie/ (diibye) is really ti- ‘that’ followed
by -©:pe (SgM), as in figure 3.16a. The result of this union is represented
in 3.16b, where both the low tone (L) and the mora (m) have become part
o f the preceding syllable. This form, tiip’è, occurs when N O T at the end of
a phrase. (The two low tones are allowed because they occur at the end
o f a word.) At the end of a phrase PLTS applies to produce tiip’è (difbye),
as in 3.16c:

(t) (5.4.1) or - © ©ne (n) (5.4.2).8
5.4.1 -hi ~ -h (t)
The morpheme - © © ? (i) (t) is suffixed to the verb o f the main clause, as
in 229:
(229) A vyéju u b e ihajkimuke n éé d itye ihjya nmibajchoki.
        a^iéhm-:pè i     ?axkhi-mm-khè né:-?(i) ti-tjhè

        self house self fix-pur
        ‘The chief told his people to fix his9 house.’This suffix occurs only with explicit preverbal subjects, as in 230a. It does
not co-occur with a classifier subject, as in the first alternative in 230b:
(230) a. ï:hm mmï§a-?i (I+ju um+va.) ‘The horse escaped.’
         horse escape-(t)              *mmi§a-:pé-?i             I

                escape-(SgM)Nor does it occur in negative clauses; such cases are discussed in the next
section.
    The suffix - © © ? (i) (t) imposes a low tone on its host’s penult:(231) a. ó $e:né-?i (ó lleen éh i) ‘I eat (fruit).’
        b. ó i?§èthé-?i (ó th v e té h i) ‘I stop.’     8A theory that entertains some notion o f m ovem ent m ight consider (t) and (n ) to be
“ tracés” o f subjects that have been m oved to a preverbal position. This could be m otivated
by the follo w in g distributional facts: (1 ) (t) and (n ) never co-occur w ith a classifier subject,
presumably because they occupy the position o f classifier subjects, and (2 ) (t) and (n ) occur
i f and on ly i f there is an overt preverbal subject (pronoun, name, or noun phrase).
    9This could also refer to “ their” house, i.e., it could be bound by the indirect object rather
than the subject o f the higher clause. The interpretation given in 229 is preferred because
‘house’ is singular. If, how ever, the object w ere plural, that is i ’ Wa ?apè (s e lf house various)
‘his/their various houses’, then the favored interpretation w ou ld be ‘ their houses’ .","[164, 165]"

action versus iteration, and so forth.17 This is discussed in section 5.7.2.
   The suffix -thrn(rn) ‘negative’ may occur between the root and the sin­
gular versus multiple suffix, as in 156:
(156) khé?'é-thmm-:Bè       (kéhyétuuuve) ‘become listless’
      have.strength-neg-sln       mfia?-thmm-:fiè (uvahtuuuve) ‘be dumbfounded’
       alert(?)-neg-slnIn this position, -thm(m) ‘negative’ is frequently preceded by -ra ‘frustrat­
ive, contraexpectation’, as in 157, but -ra does not occur in this position
without -thm(m).
(157) tfépó-ra-thmm-:Be (lléboratuuuve) ‘become deaf’
      hear-frs-neg-sln       kpahakhm-ra-thumi-:3è (wdjdcurdtuuuve) ‘bewildered, stunned’
       know-frs-neg-sln
4.3.2      Verbs derived from nounsVerbs are derived from nouns by one o f the following suffixes:18 -$e ‘treat
like, regard as’, - © O nm ‘do’, -:§e ‘become’, -the ‘become’, -§a ‘have’ or
-xkhimei ‘behave like’. These will be discussed in turn.
4.3.2.1    -lle ‘treat like, regard as’The suffix -(OO$G(""He) ‘treat like, regard as’ and -(OOnm ( _nu) ‘cause to
have, do’ derive transitive verbs. With -$e (-lle) ‘regard as’, the referent of
the direct object is compared to the referent o f the host (i.e., the noun to
which       is suffixed). For example, in 158 he (subject) regards me (object)
as a child (host):
(158) oke ts++ménélleébe.
      0-khè tehi:méné-^è-:pè               ‘He considers me to be
      1-objAn child-regard-(SgM)            like a child.’
  17For this reason the Bora dictionary (Thiesen & Thiesen 1998) lists both singular and
m ultiple forms for verbs.
  18These m ight be considered noun-incorporating verbs.","[142, 143]"

There are two ways we might think o f this. On the one hand, we might
regard kpathaxkho ‘cover’ as a transitive verb that subcategorizes for a direct
object, the object covered. On this view, ?joxtehi ‘hand’ would be regarded
as an adjunct that bears         (-v u ) ‘theme’ because it is the thing that
moves. This is the first alternative presented in figure 10.4. On the other
hand, we might regard kpathaxkho ‘cover’ as subcategorizing for both a
theme and a goal. If one expects the goal to be marked with             (-v u )
‘goal’ and the theme as a direct object, then the actual case marking would
require inversion, as represented in the second alternative o f figure 10.4.      [    girl   breast  ] hand                    [ girl hand          breast   ]

                       Figure 10.4 Inversion with watdjco ‘cover’
   We withhold judgement on this case. However, there is a case where an
inversion analysis is motivated for Bora.8 The verb axkhm (a jcu ) ‘give’ (and
perhaps a few other verbs) presents the recipient (goal) as the direct object
and marks the theme (that which passes from the giver to the recipient)
with      (-v u ) ‘goal/theme’; this is represented in figure 10.5:  8This inversion is similar to a phenomena described for Seri by M arlett (1993).","[311, 312]"

5.12.2        Lexical adverbsBora has few lexical adverbs but words o f other categories, especially ad­
jectives, may be used as adverbial modifiers. (There is also a mechanism
for deriving adverbs from adjectives; see section 4.3.7.) Whether lexical,
derived, or a word of another category, an “ adverbs’ may indicate manner,
time, place, duration, distance, quantity, or reason, (among other possi-
bilities), as now illustrated.
An adverb may indicate how an action is carried out:
(307) ïmi^ kpakhimjéi-:piè ( I m f w a k im yéifb ye.) ‘He works well.’
      good work-(SgM)(308 )i:khmi? teha-:pè (I+cui ts a a b e .) ‘He came quickly.’
      quick come-(SgM)(309)         i:khmi mè a?to (I+cui meahdo.) ‘Hurry and pay.’
        quick SAP pay
An adverb may indicate when the event took place:
(310) P éjc o re een e m éénuifbye.
      phÉxkhorè22 è:-nè     mé:nm-i-:piè                 ‘He will make that (me-
      tomorrow that-(0) make-fut-(SgM)                   dial) thing tomorrow.’
Time adverbs may be restricted as to the tense with which they co-occur.
For example, i:hjm-ihjm ‘yesterday’ may not co-occur with the future
(311b) and phéxkhoro ‘tomorrow’ may not co-occur with the present-past
(311d), as shown in 311:
An adverb may indicate how long the event persisted, as in 312:
(312) Tsu u caja fjcyaab e aah+.
      tehm:khaha fxk'ha-:pè a:?ï              ‘He was at home a long time.’
      long.time be-(SgM) home

    To this point we have not discussed -ne’s tonal properties. -ne (event)
seems to ( 1) impose a high tone on the host’s initial syllable and ( 2) delink
low tones between itself and the initial syllable, thereby making them high:
# @ ...-hne. However, it is not necessary to specify that -ne imposes the
initial high tone provided we recognize that the main verbs o f all sub­
ordinate clauses bear high tones on their first syllables, as indicated by
# @ ...-hne ‘subordinate’ in the tone derivation of i kpa:hakhm-hmkhó:-nè
in figure 16.6. Further, note that the low tone borne by -juco (:) ‘now’
is delinked but not the © that it imposes on the host’s penult. (Unfortu-

           self eat -(event) go-now-(SgM) he goes now.’
Is there any sense in which the sensory verb complement in 963a is less an
event than the adverbial clauses in 963b and c? (Here tone does not help
because the verb is too short.) The generalization seems to be this: When
a subordinate clause is headed by -ne and is a direct object, then this -ne is
- © ©ne (0). This—we assume— is the result o f subcategorization; that is,
verbs like axtjhmmi ‘see’ in 963a subcategorize for a complement headed
by - © ©ne (0). If this is correct, the tone difference is due to a syntactic
condition, not a semantic difference.
    Returning now to the -ne (n) that follows -© thm ‘negative’ (mentioned
at the very start of this section), it may be desirable to identify this with
- © ©ne (0). There are two reasons. First, the tone is consistent; indeed
the © imposed by -thm may actually be the © imposed by - © ©ne (0).
Second, this is consistent with the suggestion that negative clauses are
subordinate clauses.","[399, 400, 401]"

Thus, the choice between a personal pronoun and the anaphor may be de-
termined by the (structural) distance to the pronoun’s coreferent: a pro­
noun if sufficiently far, the anaphor if sufficiently close.
    Second, in some cases the choice between indicating a sentence’s sub­
ject with an overt personal pronoun, as opposed to using a classifier on the
verb, is determined by structural factors. For example, when a sentence is
negated with teha?(a) and -thm ‘neg’ an overt pronoun (or noun phrase) is
required, but if it is negated (contrastively) with -hi:(§a) ‘deny’, a classifier
subject is used; see section 13.3, particularly examples 850 and 851.
   However, more generally the choice is determined by the issue o f topic
continuity:
continuity: A classifier subject on the verb is generally used when the
     subject remains the same, as in the second and third sentences of
     1043, page 398. Continuity can also be maintained by making the
     subject a thematic connective, as in 1041, page 398.","[268, 269]"

used as an adverbial clause indicating comparison or manner, as in 994­
995:

        I        talk     (like) not that-(SgM) talk-neg-(n)
      ‘He does not talk like I talk.’
When one thing is compared to another, the object o f comparison may be
a relative clause headed by the classifier that corresponds to that object,
followed by -tm. For example, in 996 the relative clause is headed by -ha
(shelter), followed by -tm. (In this case -tm functions more like a case
marker than a classifier. See section 10.8 regarding comparatives.)

Chapter 18Relative ClausesGenerally, a RELATIVE CLAUSE is a subordinate clause that modifies a
noun, usually restricting the referent of that noun to those persons or
things o f which that clause is true. Bora has relative clauses, both re-
strictive and nonrestrictive (as in example 1011, page 386). Classifiers, as
we shall see, play an important role in their formation.
    In Bora, the initial syllable of the verb o f a relative clause bears high
tone. (This is true for all Bora subordinate clauses, but see the discussion
with example 114.) For example, mkpa:popè in the relative clauses in
997a and b bears high tone on the first syllable, as does mkpa:pónè in the
subordinate clause in 997c. By contrast, the nonfinite verb mkpa:po-:pè
in 997d does not bear high tone on its initial syllable; rather, it bears the
nonfinite low tone that docks on the stem’s antepenult. (See also example
132, page 102, and accompanying discussion.)

      c. ‘ I see John teaching.’
      d. ‘Hei5 the teacher^ Johni5 came.’The noun modified by a relative clause must be understandable as having
some semantic relation/role with respect to the modifying clause, since
this makes it possible to assess the truth o f the modifying clause since
it pertains to the modified noun. In many cases the modified noun is
understood as the subject of the modifying clause, as illustrated in example
997a. Such “ subject relatives” are discussed in section 18.2.
   In other cases, the modified noun is understood as having some role
other than that o f the subject o f the modifying clause, as illustrated in
example 997b above. Such cases are discussed in section 18.3.
    Note that the relative clauses o f 997a and b differ from complements,
like the sensory verb complement in 997c, and from nonfinite verbs as in
997d.
   However, before illustrating subject and non subject relative clauses,
we will discuss various structural alternatives for relative clauses.","[410, 411, 412, 413, 414]"

as the one glossed (0). This would be the case if negative clauses were
complements to a negative verb (one which time has robbed of most verbal
responsibilities and privileges). This would not only explain the presence
of -ne, but also the fact that the initial syllable o f the verb o f negative
clauses bears high tone. For example, 236 above would structurally be
the following:(2 3 8 ) [vteha?] [NP [s o max$ho-thm ] nè ]          ‘I did not eat it.’

subordinate clause terminated with - © ©ne (0). Presumably this clause
is the predicate complement o f an implicit verb be, the implicit subject of
which is something like fact. The first sentence of 239 illustrates this type
o f sentence:
(2 3 9 )       Ó m ajch oróne. A ró n a a tsa o ó ó vetu n e.
