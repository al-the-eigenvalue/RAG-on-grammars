7.14.     Questions and answers
As was described in 2.8.5, a question is marked by a particular intonation pattern: in a yes/no-
question, the antepenultimate syllable carries stress and high tone. When the penultimate
syllable is heavy (i.e., closed or long), stress and high tone are on the penultimate syllable. In
a content question, the highest tone is on the first syllable and is lowered towards the end of
the utterance.
  A yes/no question is exclusively marked by intonation, whereas a content question can, in
addition, contain a question word (cf. 3.10.6):(238)   che naya’       kos      ben‘i      dis en-na=is

        ‘What is it they eat, then?’                                     {AH, EA&AH 129}However, the question word is not an obligatory marker of an interrogative sentence. Often,
the focus of the question is implied, the only question marker being intonation (indicated here                                                                                              313
by an accent). For example, the word kemara ‘use of’ frequently occurs as the predicate of an
interrogative clause (marked by intonation), as in (241). However, that it is not a question
word can be seen in (242), where it occurs in a declarative clause, and in (243), where it is
preceded by a question word.(241)   kémara=as      rey      jampa=n

questions by the intonation.(244)   yá:yu’

following examples.(247)   naya’ jóy-na=n

        ‘Where are you going?’                                               {EG 3, 118}(248)   é e -a=kos         loy bísapa=n

part of it.","[336, 337]"

  The syntactic status of the word naya’ (cf. (238), (247) above) deserves special discussion.
First of all, while the words based on jan- and e - can be identified as the predicate of
interrogative sentences, since they are followed by an NP, this is not regularly the case with
the word naya’: as can be seen in (247) (cf. also 3.10.6), the verb it is combined with is not
preceded by an article, as is the case with a noun (cf. (238)). Also, it differs in this respect
from the other question words, which are always combined with NPs, even when the NP
contains a verb (cf. (239), (240)). Consequently, naya’ cannot be classified as a typical
content word, functioning as either a predicate or an argument. Its status needs to be
investigated further.
  The word naya’ has one more peculiarity: when combined with an bound pronoun, the
pronoun seems to appear in the obviative form (preceded by k-), a form which usually only
occurs in a transitive construction (cf. 7.5.2 above). This can be seen in (249) and (250). The
simple absential bound pronoun is ungrammatical, as shown in (251).(249)       kiro’    naya’--ki:s,          jankwa             che       ka<ma:~>may

  I will now briefly illustrate the way in which answers are given. A content question is
usually answered by a full clause:(252)       Q. naya’     kus        májniwa=n

               ‘He is in Santa Cruz, that is where he lives.’          {AY 10, 043a}The affirmative answer to a yes/no question is usually not the expression jo:jo’ ‘yes’ (cf.
12.6), but the repetition of the focalized element of the question (i.e., the predicate or the
element in topic position):183
183
      This can also be observed in local Spanish: Ya fuiste? – Fui. ‘Did you already go?’ – ‘I went.’                                                                                                            315

7.15.     Negation7.15.1. Main clause negation: kas + NMZ
In a negative main clause, the predicate is preceded by the negative particle kas (cf. 12.5.1).
At the same time, the predicate either contains a negative element, or it is converted into a
relational noun by action nominalization (cf. 11.1). The latter form is identical to that of verbs
in subordinate clauses (cf. 7.12).
   The following are examples of negative clauses with verbal predicates. Example (256)
illustrates a negative intransitive, (257) a negative transitive direct, and (258) a negative
transitive inverse clause. Note that in all cases, the deverbal noun is possessed. This is to say,
the intransitive argument and ARG1 is attached as an internal clitic or, in the case of the first
person singular (cf. (258)), it is implied. Hence, in negative main clauses, we find the same
reversed ergativity split as described for subordinate clauses in 7.12 above.(256)   bo       rey choy        jayna     kas joro-wa=n

(cf. 7.9.1), it is either reduplicated or combined with the suffix - e (cf. 11.1). Reduplication is
shown in (259) and suffixation of - e in (260):(259)   bo       choy     rey     kas dichi<ye:~>ye        kinos     kwey ji:sa:-na,

and subsequently nominalizing it by the verbal nominalizing suffix -wa. This type of
nominalization creates an unpossessed noun (cf. 11.9.4).(261)   kas rey i’ko-ni-wa               po’so, bo             is     rey po’so ma’nes

        ‘Those didn’t break easily, the jugs, because they were hard.’ {HR, TX 258}As can be seen in (263), the negated free pronoun is often used instead of the negated noun.

the demonstrative is nominalized in the same way as a free pronoun, i.e. by the combination
of -ni ‘PRC’ and -wa ‘NMZ’. The following are examples:(266)    kas jayna         kiro’-ni-wa            kis      o -ka- e-na=i

         ‘There was no one who cheated him when he bargained, absolutely not!’
         {EA, Abuelo 017}A possessive predicate (cf. 7.9.5) is either negated by a demonstrative, as described above, or
by the irrealis marker <a’> (cf. 3.6.2, 10.4), as shown in (268) and (269).184
184
    Note that even though the affirmative and the negative form of the possessive predicate are not
morphologically similar, there is an interesting parallel. Both the formation of the affirmative predicate by
prefixing reduplication (cf. 7.9.5) and that of the negative predicate by infixation of the irrealis marker are
applied according to the first iambic foot of the word (cf. 3.6.2, 3.7.6).","[337, 338, 339, 340, 341]"

            ‘Are you wiping it clean?’The examples above show that all syllables from the right are counted, independently of their
morphological status. In (197), the antepenultimate stressed, high-tone syllable consists of an
article, which is normally unstressed. In (198), the three syllables which determine the
intonation pattern only consist of a linking vowel and cliticized bound pronouns. In (199), the
final syllable is the release vowel following the glottal stop of the presential bound pronoun
/ak/, realized as [a a].
  In contrast to the last three syllables of the utterance, the syllables that precede a stressed
syllable can participate in the intonation pattern only if they belong to a content word. A
function word or clitic is not stressed and does not receive a marked tone. In the above
examples, this concerned the first elements of the utterance. In (200), it concerns the feminine
article /iknes/:(200)   /puruknan--iknes     alwahan/

content word in the question is heavy, i.e. closed (cf. (201)) or lengthened (cf. (202)). Stress
then falls on the penultimate syllable:(201)   /kah ditrimeme a            as          t orankwanto/

        ‘Have you already wiped the table clean?’In contrast, a heavy penultimate syllable is not stressed when it is distributed over two
phonological words. In (203), the syllable /nik/ is not stressed because its final consonant
belongs to an externally cliticized element:(203)   /hajna sehawni--kne/

vowels become short, even when they occur before the penultimate syllable position of the

respectively, of the same sentence.(204)   /hajna ba:lo:mah/

            ‘Do (we) finish already?’The intonation pattern of content questions is slightly different from that of yes/no questions
described so far. In content questions, the first syllable of the utterance typically receives a
high pitch, and the pitch gets lower towards the end of the utterance. This can roughly be
presented as in (205):(205)   /t e   kemaras    rej          hampan/
        and    use_of:ART again        do_like:2
        [t 'k ma ah j 'ham'pan]
        ‘And what do you do that for?’In addition, in content questions, the last two syllables of the utterance typically have equal
weight and stress. This could be seen in (205) above and is also illustrated by (206) below.","[75, 76, 77]"

intonation. The basic stress and intonation rule for a yes/no question is the following, to be
specified below (H = high tone and stress, M = mid tone and no stress, # = end of utterance,
… = no marked tone and no stress):(196)       (…) H M             M (…) H M                M       (…)       H M   M #The matrix in (196) is to be interpreted as follows: in a question, stress and high tone fall on
the antepenultimate syllable of the entire utterance.31 The last three syllables of the
interrogative utterance participate in this intonation pattern independently of their morphemic
status (i.e., particles and clitics are included). The content words that precedes this segment
also receive stress and high tone on the antepenultimate syllable. Function words that precede
a stressed syllable do not participate in the stress/tone pattern. This is indicated by the dots
(…).
  Any utterance can be fit into this matrix and is thereby marked as a question. Consider the
following examples, in which the declarative intonation (a.) is contrasted with the
interrogative intonation (b.):(197)       /kas      tot ididi=as                   rojan/

3.10.6. Question words
A question in Movima is marked by a particular intonation pattern, described in 2.8.5. In
addition, a content question is typically introduced by one of the following elements:(229)       naya’                ‘where?’
            jan-                 ‘which?’
            e-                   ‘what?’The question word naya’, the only morphologically simple question word, is illustrated in
(230) and (231).",[145]

        ‘It [the cow] had already given birth several times.’        {GB, Ganado 069}Thus, the root jan- may not have a specific interrogative function at all, even though it occurs
in a particular type of question. This morpheme requires further research.
  The root e - is used to mark questions which ask for the identity of a person or object. Like
jan-, it is obligatorily combined with a bound nominal element. However, it seems to be less
productive in this respect, and it is never combined with the semantically empty bound
element -ra. By default, it is combined with the bound root e ‘BR.name’:(244)   é -e -a=n

undergoes infixing reduplication, the reason for which is not clear. The following examples
illustrate this for the incorporated elements o:ra ‘hour’ (cf. (250)), poy ‘BR.animal’ (cf.
(251)) and lo ‘BR.liquid’ (cf. (252)):
                                                                                            125

  The question word e -e -, with the bound root e ‘BR.name’ (cf. (244), (245) above) seems
to be more lexicalized than the ones containing other bound elements. This is why, outside the
present chapter, I represent it as an unanalysable word. For example, the bound root e
‘BR.name’ is not preceded by a glottal stop, in contrast to its occurrence in other
constructions. Compare the pronunciation of the question in (253)a with the noun containing
the same bound root in (253)b:(253)   a. é -e -a=a          ['  a a]           ‘What is it?’
        b. kem-’e -a=‘ne      [k m ' a n ]       ‘her surname’Also, the question word e e - does not necessarily ask for a name. It can be used to ask for
more general information, as in (254) and (255):(254)   é -e -a=kos                      jeya=n
        what-BR.name-LV=ART.n.a          state_of=2

        ‘Then they know what the people are doing.’       {EA, Summary 027}More evidence for the lexicalization of the element e e a- ‘what’ is provided by the fact that
there is an apparently synonymous short form, e a-:(256)   é e a=a,    eney,    é a=is        siripipimmo, ope’e,          jankwa

        ‘What might have been wrong with them?’                          {HR, TX 190}The question marker e - can not only be combined with a bound nominal element, but also
with the subordinating particle jan ‘consequently’ (not related to the interrogative root jan-
described above). In a declarative utterance, this particle introduces an adverbial clause the
content of which was explained by the preceding discourse (cf. 7.12.6). The predicate of the
subordinate clause introduced by jan is nominalized by the suffix -na (cf. 11.1.3):(259)   jan     no-kos       jiwa-na=sne
        CSQ obl-ART.n.a come-NMZ.CSQ=f.a

construction is the same as in the declarative clause (cf. (259)), and different from that of
questions introduced by e - in combination with a bound nominal element: the word is not
followed by an internal clitic, but by an oblique NP (underlined). The root e - in this
construction indicates that the speaker does not know the reason for the circumstance
described by the subordinate clause.(260)   e -jan      no-kos        sa~sal-na=n
        what-CSQ    obl-ART.n.a DR~search-NMZ.CSQ=2

        ‘They knew why he died.’                                       {HR, TX 314}To conclude, Movima does not have a clearly defined category of question words. The
elements which typically occur in questions have quite heterogeneous properties, and more
research is required as to their exact morphological and syntactic status. Probably the central
device for marking an interrogative utterance in Movima is intonation (cf. 2.8.5).","[147, 148, 149, 150]"

seen as morphological nouns. They are different from adjectives and verbs composed of a
root and an obligatory bound element (cf. 3.10.5) in that they receive person marking by an
internal clitic. Evidence for this is the fact that the second person is encoded by =n, as in
(238) and (240) above, a morpheme which only occurs in the set of internal clitics (cf. 4.1).
Also, the clitics are preceded by the linking vowel -a when the word ends in a consonant, as
in (238) and (239) above.58 In contrast, for verbs and adjectives, person marking by an
internal clitic is only possible when they contain a bivalent voice marker (cf. 8.1). Thus,
formally, words with the root jan- can be classed as relational nouns (cf. 6.3).
  While words with the root jan- typically introduce a question, they can also occur in a
declarative clause (distinguished from questions by intonation, cf. 2.8.5). The words jankwa
and jampa, usually not used as question words (cf. (241), (242)), provide examples of this. In
(243), another example of a word with jan- in a declarative clause is given:
57
  The function of the suffix -kwi in this context requires further research.
58
  Stress does not help to identify the type of cliticization here, since interrogative sentences have a special stress
pattern.","[145, 146, 147]"

3.10. Parts of Speech
The major parts of speech that can be distinguished in Movima are nouns, verbs, and
particles. Adjectives form a subclass of nouns. Question words, which will also be discussed
in this chapter, have some properties that distinguish them from other word classes, but they
do not form one homogeneous class.
  The distinction between verbs (cf. 3.10.1) and nouns (cf. 3.10.2) can only be made on
morphological, not on morphosyntactic grounds: while verbs typically function as predicates
and nouns typically as arguments, verbs can function as arguments and nouns can function as
predicates, too, without any morphological modification. There are, however, some
morphemes that apply only to nouns, but not to verbs. These serve as a criterion for
distinguishing the two word classes. Other morphemes can apply to both nouns and verbs, but
they usually have different functions depending on the base to which they are attached (cf.
3.10.3).
  Adjectives can, according to their morphological form, be split up into two groups: nounlike
and verblike adjectives. In general, adjectives are more similar to nouns, since they can be
combined with the nominal morphemes. Within the class of nouns, however, they have a
special status. Nominal affixes have a different degree of productivity on adjectives than on
nouns, and adjectives can only occur as the first part of compounds. Some adjectives can also
be formally identical to verbs. The properties of adjectives are discussed in 3.10.4.
  The main borderline cases between nouns, verbs, and adjectives, are described in a special
section (cf. 3.10.5).
  The classification of question words and particles, both highly heterogeneous classes,
requires further research. Question words are presented in 3.10.6, particles are briefly
characterized in 3.10.7 (and cf. Ch. 12).",[129]

12.5.1. kas: main clause negation
The particle kas forms a negative clause (cf. 7.15.1). At the same time, the predicate is
morphologically modified. In the canonical negative clause, this is achieved with action
nominalization through -wa when the predicate is a verb or through infixing reduplication
when the predicate is a morphological noun (cf. 11.1.1):(221)   kas ona-ye-na-wa=sne                  os juyeni n-as      Tirinra
        NEG know-BE.person-DR-NMZ=f.a ART.n.p person obl-ART.n Trinidad

        ‘(It was) a bright night, it wasn’t dark.’                      {EA, Escape 050}When the predicate in the negative clause already contains a negative affix, it is not
additionally nominalized. In (223) and (224), the predicate contains the irrealis infix <a’> (cf.
10.3). The predicate in (225) contains the mental-state suffix -baycho, which typically has a
negative meaning (cf. 10.5).(223)   kas rey yok-a’-na=as                n-is         majniwa=a

        and right_now NEG person<IRR>
        ‘And now, no one will be there.’                                {EA, Cabildo 021}(225)   jayna     in a       kas ney-ni-baycho

        ‘I don’t want to be here anymore.’                              {EA, Cbba 035}The negative particle kas is special in that it resembles very much the neuter article. First of
all, it has similar syntactic properties: kas precedes a predicate which is nominalized, in the
same way in which the neuter article precedes a nominalized predicate in subordinate clauses,
shown in (226) and (227):(226)   bo         as      ona-ye-wa=sne
        REAS       ART.n know-BE.person-NMZ=f.a
        ‘so that she might get to know X (a person)’(227)   n-as           pa<ya~>yak-a=as
        obl-ART.n.p dark<NMZ.N~>-LV=n.a
        ‘when it is dark’
                                                                                             543
Morphologically, the negative particle and the neuter article are similar as well. First of all,
both occur before action nouns (cf. 11.1.1):(228)   a. kas      chi:-wa=a              b. as        chi:-wa=a
           NEG go_out-NMZ=n                   ART.n go_out-NMZ=n
           ‘It doesn’t come/go out.’          ‘its coming/going out’Second, not only the article, but also the negative particle is phonologically conflated with the
first-person marker (cf. 4.4):(229)   a. ka         chi:-wa            b. a        chi:-wa
           NEG.1 go_out-NMZ                 ART.n.1 go_out-NMZ
           ‘I don’t come/go out.’           ‘my coming/going out’This morphological parallel with the article suggests that the final element s of the negative
particle is the same determining element that occurs on the article and on demonstratives,
described in 3.9.3 and 4.4.
  A third parallel between the negative particle and the article concerns the form of this
particle, kas, and the organization of the article paradigm (cf. 4.4). Recall from 4.4 that the
absential article is always contains an initial k; for example, the presential masculine article is
us, and the absential masculine article is kus. The absential neuter article, kos, is irregular in
that it is not only marked by k, but also has a different vowel than the presential neuter article,
as. The form that would be expected to represent the absential neuter article is kas. However,
the morpheme kas functions as the negative particle. Historically, therefore, it is possible that
the negative particle originates from the article paradigm, and that the change *kas > kos
resulted from the need to differentiate between negation and the article.
  Note that there are several particles that are morphologically and semantically related to the
negative particle kas: the negative expression ka:’i ‘no’, which is often used in the same way
as kas; the preclusive particle ka: (cf. 12.5.5); and the prohibitive particle ka’ (cf. 12.5.4).
12.5.2. loy negation of subordinate and relative clauses
The function of the negative particle loy, not to be confused with the homophonous modal
particle loy ‘intentional’ (cf. 12.3.2 above), was already described in 7.15.2. It negates relative
and subordinate clauses. In relative clauses, loy goes together with partial action
nominalization (cf. 11.1.2). This is to say, in negative relative clauses, only monovalent
predicates are converted into action nouns, which are non-relational. In subordinate clauses,
in contrast, the particle loy has no effect on the form of the subordinate predicate.
  Examples (230) and (231) show loy in a relative clause with a bivalent and with a
monovalent predicate, respectively. Note that the bivalent predicate in (230) is not
nominalized, whereas the monovalent predicate in (231), which is a noun, receives the suffix
- e (cf. 11.1):
544

the article and action nominalization. Note that the predicate, whether monovalent, as in
(232), or bivalent, as in (233), occurs in the same form that it would have if the clause were
affirmative. In (232), the predicate is a canonical action nominal formed by the suffix -wa (cf.
11.1.1). In (233) and (234), the predicate contains the the nominalizing suffix -na that is
required by the subordinating particle jan ‘CSQ’ (cf. 11.1.3).(232)   n-os        jayna loy            mere’     avo-ni-wa=y’ i       jayna

The particle mo: ‘not yet’ occurs right before the predicate. It indicates that the event has not
occurred at the time of reference, but will, or is expected to, occur later. The time of reference
can be the time of speaking or the time of the narrative context. In (235), the time of reference
is the time of speaking:(235)   bo     rey ney mo: rey           ba:-ra-wa              as     yejcho
        REAS again here yet again finish-BE:ntr-NMZ ART.n month

In (236), the first ocurrence of mo: refers to the time of speaking within the narrative. The
second ocurrence, which represents part of a comment made by the narrator, refers to the time
of narrative context, in this case the day before the events are narrated:(236)   che    usko       kuro’      mo: joyaj-wa,          jankwa,
        and    PRO.m.a DM.m.a yet arrive-NMZ                say

        REAS     yet arrive-NMZ--m.a
        ‘“And he hasn’t arrived yet,” I said, because he hadn’t arrived yet.’ {EA, Visita 040}In (237), the time of reference is in the past:(237)   n-os         kwil     bay im-a=y’ i rey         mo: maj<a’><ni:~>ni

        ‘When we first had a field, I didn’t have any children yet.’
        {EA, Chaco III 001}The particle mo: triggers partial nominalization (cf. 11.1.2). When the predicate of the
subordinate clause introduced by mo: is monovalent, as in (236), it is converted into a non-
relational noun through the suffixation of -wa or, if it is a noun, through reduplication (cf.
(237)). When the predicate of the subordinate clause is bivalent, however, it remains
unmodified, as illustrated in (238):(238)   aya-ti            bo        mo: lirij-na=‘ne
        wait.DR-IMP.tr REAS         yet shake-DR=f
        ‘Wait because she hasn’t shaken [the tablecloth] yet.’             {EA 19, 146g}Note that partial nominalization of the predicate (cf. 11.1.2) not only occurs with mo: ‘not
yet’, but also with the negative particles loy ‘NEG’ in relative clauses (cf. 12.5.2 above) and
ka’ ‘prohibitive’ (cf. 12.5.4 below).12.5.4. ka’ ‘prohibitive’
The particle ka’ marks the prohibitive construction. It has the same formal properties as mo:
‘not yet’, described above. When the predicate is monovalent, it is nominalized, and when
bivalent, it is not. In (239)–(241), the construction is shown with monovalent, nominalized
predicates:(239)   ka’       na -u’-wa,                ka’        pen-lo -wa

The particle ka: introduces an adverbial clause, i.e., an oblique noun phrase containing a
nominalized predicate (cf. 7.12.3). It indicates that the event described in the adverbial clause
should be prevented. The following examples illustrate the use of this particle:(243)   day-a-ra=n        no-kowa         ban     taw-ka-ra-na=n

before a noun phrase (cf. 12.1.4 above). This is illustrated in (245):(245)   jayna us-che              po:ra,     bo       ka:       n-as  mam~man-wa

12.6.     Interjections
According to Schachter (1985: 58), interjections are “words, often of an exclamatory
character, that can constitute utterances in themselves, and that usually have no syntactic
connection to any other words that may cooccur with them.” In Movima, these include: jo:jo’
‘yes’, ka:’i ‘no’, and chu’ ‘stop it!’. I will illustrate them in turn.
12.6.1. jo:jo’ ‘yes’
This is an affirmative interjection. It can be translated as ‘yes’. However, it is normally not
used as an answer to a question (cf. 7.14), but as a positive reaction to, or a reinforcement of,
the preceding utterance. Example (246) is from a dialogue, and in (247), the speaker
reinforces what she has said before:(246)   A. usko     dis rey        jankwa=n      kempa-kay-a=y’ i
           PRO.m.a OPT again say=2               inform-INV-LV=1pl
           ‘You should have said to him that he could tell us.’        B. jo:jo’o, ban rey       jankwa n-usko            no-kos
           yes      but again say            obl-PRO.m.a obl-ART.n.a

           certainly again FRUST go-NMZ=1pl
           ‘Yes, but I told him that we really wanted to go.’ {EA&EG, Dialogue 087}(247)   tes-che beyka n-os            jayna joy-wa=y’ i n-os         ro:ya, jo:jo’

        ‘[He] limped, poor guy, as we went to the house, really.’ {Sicurí 092}
12.6.2. ka:’i ‘no’
The particle ka:’i is used to answer questions negatively (cf. 7.14):(248)   Q.    kas rapál-di- e          kós   as-na=n
              NEG red-BE.house-NMZ.N ART.n.a sit-DR=2
              ‘Is your house not red?’        A.    ka:’i, bo           ja’     tavoj-di--as
              no       REAS       just    white-BE.house--n.a
              ‘No, it’s just white.’                                        {EA 8, 045}Sometimes, ka:’i is used in the same way as kas (cf. 12.5.1 above), i.e., in combination with a
nominalized predicate (cf. (249)):(249)   che ka:’i oso’-ni-wa                  os      rim-wanra=y’ i
        and no       DM.n.p-PRC-NMZ           ART.n.p trade-INSTR:BE.ntr=1pl
        ‘And we had no money.’                                     {EA, Vida 020}548
The particle ka:’i is sometimes realized as ka:. Its ending -‘i can probably be analyzed as the
dummy element (cf. 2.9.5). However, I represent this morpheme as monomorphemic, since
the element ka: normally functions as the preclusive particle (cf. 12.5.5 above).
12.6.3. chu’ ‘stop it!’
This exclamation is used to chase away chicken or to tell someone to stop doing something.(250)   chu’,      ka’ tore-na=n as            me:sa
        stop.IMP NEG ?-DR=2          ART.n table
        ‘Stop that, don’t knock on the table!’                                {JM 19, 029}(251)   chu’      na-kal         bo        po~poy-kwa
        stop.IMP obl-DM.ad.n REAS          RED~BR.animal-ABS
        ‘Leave that, it’s an animal!’                                       {EC 15, 088}
12.7. The filler particle eney
There is one particle used when the speaker does not find the right word: eney. This particle
occurs most often inside an NP, i.e. after the article, and is also found after the relativizer.
Both instances can be found in (252). This is an example in which the speaker looks for a
word of Spanish origin, anteteta:nika ‘anti-tetanus vaccination’.(252)   jayna ya’ e ban-na=is         an is           eney,

        call it.’                                                       {EA, Lagartija 039}Possibly, eney is a historically complex form, consisting of the demonstrative adverb ney
‘here’ and a preceding element e. Judy & Judy (1967) describe an element e- that precedes
demonstratives. However, this element does not occur in the database used here. If the filler                                                                                             549
particle eney can indeed be traced back to a demonstrative, then it may be a calque on the
Spanish filler particle este ‘this (masculine)’.","[565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573]"

                ‘It was a jaguar that the dogs had met, madam.’                            {EA, Jaguar 085}In (141)a, the bivalent verb manaye ‘meet’ is the predicate and the nouns pa:ko ‘dog’ and
rulrul ‘jaguar’ occur in the two argument NPs, ARG1 and ARG2. In (141)b, in contrast, the
noun rulrul functions as a monovalent predicate: “(is a) jaguar”. Here, the verb manaye
‘meet’ occurs together with its ARG1 (=os pa:ko) in the NP representing the argument of the
clause. Since ARG1 and the possessor are encoded identically, this NP can be considered
possessed: “the met (one) of the dogs”. This NP is cross-referenced by the free pronoun in
topic position: “It was a jaguar, the met one of the dogs.”171
   An alternative way to analyse clauses of the type in (141)b might seem to maintain that the
verb manaye ‘meet’ is the predicate and that the noun rulrul belongs to the NP representing
ARG2. With the predicate in bold-print and the arguments underlined, this can be represented
as in (10). However, this construction would be difficult to explain. Why does the noun rulrul
‘jaguar’ occur before the article? Has it been extracted from its usual position in the NP? And
what is the function of the free pronoun in topic position, if ARG2 is already represented by
an NP in preverbal position? Instead of seeking answers to these questions, it is much more
likely that clauses of this type are structured in analogy to equational clauses, as described
earlier in this section.172(10)         asko        rulrul os          man<a>ye=is                        pa:ko, ma’a

        ‘And [the agouti] could be heard in its cave.’                       {EA, Jaguar 040}A question that might be asked is what would happen if the entities denoted by these nouns
had a first-person inalienable possessor (given an appropriate context), which would not be
encoded by an enclitic and which, therefore, would not trigger the linking vowel. The answer
is that even if it were possible for these nouns to denote a part of a human, i.e., a body part,
they would not be marked for possession in this way, but by reduplication of -kwa. This
process is described in 6.5.3, and the marking of body-part terms is described in 6.6.
  When the suffix -kwa is omitted from a noun whose base has the structure CVCV, as is the
case with the nouns in (59)c., the base has to be augmented in a different manner. Due to the
vocalic ending of these bases, no linking vowel is attached which could create a base with
three moras. In order to achieve the required structure, these bases undergo infixing
reduplication. The reduplication creates a base of three syllables to which the enclitic is
attached:(72)    lo.si.si=is
        lo<si~>si=is
        resin<RED~>=pl.a
        ‘their resin (of the trees)’                            {EA 14, 083}This process is also applied to bases that already contain prefixing reduplication, as is the case
for some of the nouns listed under (59)c., e.g. ba~ba:-kwa ‘fruit’. When the suffix -kwa is
dropped here to create a possessive base, the remaining base ba~ba has to be additionally
reduplicated before the possessor is cliticized. This is illustrated by (73):(73)    jayna     lok-a:- e        is          ba~<ba~>ba=as  ko’
        DSC       fall-DR-CO ART.pl RED~<RED~>BR.round=ART.n tree
        ‘I made the fruits fall off the tree.’               {JM 16, 372b}Note that, even though these nouns denote inalienably possessed entities, I analyse the
infixing reduplication here as a purely phonological process, not as the marker of inalienable
possession described in 6.4.1. This is because, with regard to nouns ending in -kwa, the
reduplication is only found on bases with the form CVCV. If it were a semantically relevant
derivation, the infixing reduplication would be found on the other bases, too.
  Other bound roots that denote parts of wholes and display the same behaviour were given in
5.3.2.1. In difference to the bases described here, however, those roots do not normally occur
with the suffix -kwa.","[269, 270]"

incorporation. As was tested in elicitation, the verbs here can only be used in transitive
clauses, although the incorporated elements clearly indicate the type of undergoer involved in
the action (‘mud’ in (34), ‘dust’ in (35), and ‘animal’ in (36)). These may be borderline cases
between argument incorporation and classificatory modifying incorporation (cf. 9.2.6 below).(34)    loj-a-but-a=n               kis              mo’incho:-bun

        ‘Because he appreciated it [the dog] and liked (it).’     {JM, Perro II 058}As can be seen, no clear pattern could as yet be discovered which may account for the
acceptability of some incorporating verbs in transitive clauses and the inacceptability of
others.
  An important criterion which needs to be kept in mind when examining the lability of
incorporating verbs is the construction in which the verb occurs. As was shown in (11) above,
when a verb with an incorporated argument occurs in an NP, the NP is marked as possessed.
Since possessive marking is identical to transitive person marking (cf. 6.1 and 7.1, 7.2), this
similarity can lead to the conclusion that the verb is bivalent, even though this is not the case.
To illustrate the point, example (37)a shows the usual construction with a verb with an
incorporated argument in an intransitive clause, as can be seen from the fact that the only core
argument is represented by an external clitic. In (37)b, the verb occurs in an NP (underlined),
which is marked as possessed by an internal clitic. That this does not imply that the verb can
be used as a transitive predicate is shown by the ungrammaticality of (37)c, where the verb376
occurs with an internally cliticized pronoun and an NP that is not marked as oblique.(37)       a. ye -a:-mi--’ne             ni-kis to:mi

further investigation. The questions to be answered include:       –   Are we dealing with two homophonous bound elements here (comparable to example
           (38) below)?
       –   Is it the syntactic construction that makes the difference, e.g., the presence of an
           independent NP?
       –   Are these verbs on their way to lexicalization, so that the direct marker is interpreted
           as a valency marker for the entire verb?","[398, 399, 400]"
"3.10.7. Particles
The class of particles is heterogeneous in their formal and functional properties. It can
roughly be subdivided into conjunctions, TAM markers, discourse markers, interjections, and
adverbs. They are described in Ch. 12. A more fine-grained distinction requires further
research. For the time being, I comprise all independent words which are neither nouns, verbs,
adjectives, question words, nor referential elements as particles.
  The common property of the approximately 60 elements that fall into this class is that, in
contrast with the other parts of speech, they are not morphologically modified. Particles                                                                                            127
usually consist of a single root. Some are disyllabic, as in (262). In this class, there are
disyllabic words whose first syllable is heavy, as in (262), and others where both syllables are
light, as in (262)b. Other function words consist of a monosyllabic root (cf. (263) and (264)),
which can even be monomoraic (cf. (264)):(262)   a. jayna     ‘already, then’           b. tela     ‘almost’

As was already observed by Judy & Judy (1967: 403), only the verb root mas- ‘beat’ takes yet
another allomorph, -o’, shown in (120). This allomorph does not occur on any other verb root.(120)     loy mas-o’-na
          ITN beat-INT-DR
          ‘I’ll beat X up terribly.’                                          {EA 12, 099a}The distribution of -u’ and -ay’ depends on the (last) vowel of the root (cf. 2.9.8). It is based
on maximal distinctness: roots containing /a/ (with the exception of mas- ‘beat’) take the
suffix -u’ (cf. (118)), and those containing /u/ take the suffix -ay’ (cf. (119)). Roots that
contain one of the other vowels, /o/, /e/, or /i/, can take either of the suffixes:(121)     a. tos-ay’-na
        ~ b. tos-u’-na
             peel-INT-DR
             ‘I peel it well.’                                                  {JM 18, 384}(122)     a. werel-ay’-na

             dry-INT-DR
             ‘I dry it well [e.g. by putting it outside].’                      {JM 16, 316}(123)     a. lirij-ay’-na

             ‘I shake it well.’                                                   {JM 16, 331}When the intensifying suffix is attached to a vowel, it is usually preceded by a /k/, as in (124).
On some bases, however, it is preceded by the palatal glide, and the form with /k/ is not
accepted, as shown in (125). Possibly, the verb root leve- ‘chase off’ originally had the form
levey-, which has remained in this derivation.(124)     jo-kay’-na
        ~ jo-ku’-na
          heat-INT-DR
          ‘I heat X well.’                                                             {JM 16, 322}(125)     a. loy i         leve-yay’-na    is          jo’me

The intensifying suffix directly follows the verb root. Therefore, it never cooccurs with the
base-internal allomorph of the direct marker (-a), which can only occur in second-syllable
position (cf. 8.1.1). When it cooccurs with the multiple-event marker -ka (cf. 10.2.1), the
intensifying suffix comes first:(126)   loy i kel-u’-ka-ba -na
        ITN 1 open-INT-MLT-BR.cover-DR
        ‘I’ll uncover (it) [e.g. the firewood] completely.’                   {EA 12, 108b}A base with the intensive marker takes, in principle, the same voice markers as a verb root (cf.
8.1). The above examples all contained the direct voice marker. The following are examples
of an intensified verb with the inverse (cf. (127)) and the reflexive/reciprocal marker (cf.
(128)):(127)   sal-u’-kay
        search-INT-INV
        ‘X searched for me well.’                                             {JM 17, 212j}(128)   kwey i        sal-u’-che        che ka         dumme-wa=n

        ‘We just searched thoroughly for each other, and [despite this] we didn’t meet.’
        {JM 17, 212k}Like on a simple verb root, the resultative is marked by the dummy element -‘i (cf. 8.1.5):(129)   sal-u’-’i
        search-INT-D
        ‘It has been/has to be searched for well.’                          {JM 17, 212n}(130)   choy      rey lirij-ay’-’i      i:

        ‘These have to be shaken well, of course.’                          {JM16, 331}The agentive marker -e e, however, has not been found on intensified bases.
  The intensifying suffix is most productively combined with bivalent roots. However, in
spontaneous speech, it is mainly found with the monovalent positional roots de:- ‘lie’, as-
‘sit’, en- ‘stand’, and bat- ‘be put’, as in the following examples.(131)   ban jayna n          rey      de-ku’-ni        jayna

         ‘... the one egg that had stayed put so that it [the hen] would lay eggs.’249
         {EA, Huevo 004f.}Notice that these bases are usually combined with the verbalizing suffix -ni. Since this suffix
usually appears on bases which can also appear independently (typically nouns; cf. 11.9), this
suggests that the bases in (131)–(134) can also occur alone. However, it is not clear whether
this is the case: the forms enu’, asu’ etc. are accepted by some speakers as an answer to a
question, as in (135), but rejected by others.","[472, 473, 474, 475]"
"
2.10.6. Representation of stress
The representation of stress is, in general, avoided. In the case of the different types of
cliticization, where stress is distinctive, the stress pattern of the morphological unit has to be
inferred from the cliticization symbol:(265)   a. dewajna--us [       'wahna us]      ‘I see him.’
        b. dewajna=us [        wah'na us]      ‘He sees X.’However, the stress symbol is used to reflect interrogative intonation (cf. 2.8.5):(266)   jayna bálomaj        ‘Have we finished already?’

3      Morphological Units and ProcessesThis chapter introduces the types of morphemes that exist in Movima, the different
morphological processes, and gives an overview of the parts of speech. The morphology is
complex, because many words are not composed of a lexical element (the root) and
grammatical elements (affixes), but often contain two (or more) elements of lexical origin.
Apart from that, some morphemes are attached not according to morphological, but to metric
criteria. Further research is needed to establish and schematize the different levels to which
the morphological processes apply.
  This chapter is structured as follows. The first part describes the main morphological units
and processes. The use of the terms “root” and “base” is defined in 3.1. Sections 3.2–3.9
describe the different bound morphemes and morphological processes. These include bound
lexical elements (3.3), affixes and affixation (3.4), incorporation (3.5), the different types of
reduplication (3.6), and the different types of cliticization (3.8). A pattern characteristic of
Movima, which is that certain morphemes can occur twice in a word, is shown in section 3.7.
  Section 3.10, which occupies the second half of this chapter, introduces the different parts
of speech distinguished in Movima. The main classes are nouns, verbs, and particles.
Adjectives constitute a subclass of nouns, and it will be discussed whether question words can
be seen as a word class of their own.","[91, 92]"

Acknowledgements
Many people have helped me get this work done. First and foremost, my gratitude goes to
Pieter Muysken, who has made this project possible by hosting it within his Spinoza
programme “Lexicon and Syntax” at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Not only did I
benefit from his insightful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript, which were always
to the point and opened new lines of thought for me. He also gave me the feeling that
whatever problem there would be on the way, he would try to help out. Whenever I
approached him for linguistic or non-linguistic advice, I got an open ear, no matter whether it
was the right moment or not. His confidence in this project and his constant encouragement
were an enormous support.
   I was also very lucky in that during the entire project, I had Rik van Gijn as my office mate.
This meant lots of fun, discussions, and the possibility to exchange experiences on life in the
linguistic world. My work has benefited greatly from Rik’s insights and from his talent to
present things systematically.
   Hein van der Voort, occasional office mate, advised me in many ways. In particular, I am
very grateful for his extremely detailed, critical and helpful comments on the entire
manuscript.
   I owe many thanks to Mily Crevels, who has helped me a lot especially at the beginning of
this project. In particular, Mily accompanied me to Santa Ana in 2001, and through her I got
acquainted with the people who became my closest friends there. With respect to field work
and dealing with practical matters in the Beni, Mily gave me the most valuable advice.
   Outside the Spinoza group, I want to thank the following linguists for commenting on
earlier drafts of specific chapters of this book, for discussing the data with me, and/or for
advising me on particular topics: Willem Adelaar, Martin Böhler, Werner Drossard, Dan
Everett, Mats Exter, Ad Foolen, Colette Grinevald, Carlos Gussenhoven, Birgit Hellwig,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, Helen de Hoop, Haike Jacobs, Leonid Kulikov, Geraldine Legendre,
Andrej Malchukov, Maarten Mous, Doris Payne, Hans-Jürgen Sasse, René Schiering, Anna
Siewierska, Leon Stassen, and Fernando Zúñiga. I am especially grateful to Werner Drossard,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, and Hans-Jürgen Sasse for the long and inspiring discussions on the
Movima voice and valency system, whose essence I would probably never have understood
otherwise. My particular gratitude also goes to Willem Adelaar and Carlos Gussenhoven for
discussing earlier versions of the phonology chapter with me, and for their patience in
answering my numerous questions on the topic. In addition, I am deeply indebted to Willem
Adelaar for his valuable comments on the entire manuscript. And Maarten Mous is especially
thanked for sitting with me for hours when I was desperate and did not know how this work
could ever come to an end.
   Pilar Valenzuela is acknowledged for pointing out Movima to me as a possible language of
research.
   I furthermore want to thank the participants of the Americanist Colloquium in Nijmegen for
their comments on my talks, in particular Jürgen Bohnemeyer, Swintha Danielsen, Martina
Faller, Rafael Fischer, Jesus Mario Girón, Katja Hanss, Roland Hemmauer, Sergio Meira,
Loretta O’Connor, and Frank Seifart. And without the critical questions from the participants
of my “Strukturkurs Movima” at the Linguistics Department in Cologne, some problems and
contradictions in my analyses would hardly ever have become apparent to me.                                                                                                i
   While it was not possible to integrate into the present work all the comments I got, they
highly increased my insight into the Movima grammar.
   My research has also benefited greatly from the open and friendly atmosphere at the
Linguistics Department of the Radboud University in Nijmegen. My thanks go particularly to
Helen de Hoop, Monique Lamers, Peter de Swart, Andrej Malchukov, Joost Zwarts, Wilske
Driessen, Janine van der Zijl, Else Havik, Margot van den Berg, and Marleen van de Vate.
   It is hard to express my gratitude adequately to the Movima speakers who contributed the
data on which this grammar is based. Their hospitality and their willingness to teach me their
language were overwhelming.
   First of all, I want to thank Esaltación Amblo Ovales, who took upon herself the task of
teaching me Movima. She is the best teacher I could have imagined, with her clarity of
pronunciation, her great memory, and her readiness to talk to me in Movima about all kinds of
topics. I am also grateful to her sister Etelvina and her cousin Modesta for receiving me in
their house with so much friendliness.
   My thanks go furthermore to Julia Malale Humasa, my principal teacher during my first and
my last stay. Good-humoured and funny, yet serious when it came to analysing her language,
she is a delightful instructor.
   I owe many thanks to Eligardo Chirimani Malue for working with me every day right from
the beginning. Without his linguistic insight and his careful judgment, it would never have
been possible to create such a large and useful text database. Apart from that, it is mainly due
to the fact that he and Melvin Rossel Yoqui took so much interest in maintaining their native
language that this research was carried out at all. The other members of the Subcentral
Indígena Movima are also acknowledged for supporting this project throughout.
   I am furthermore grateful to Griselda Cáumol, Balvina Almaquio, Herlan Rojas, Ela Rossel,
Nelly Gualusna, Peregrina Cayú, Dora Vargas, Delmira Masaro, Nataniel Cáumol, Eleuterio
Mole, Alejandro Yónima, Juan Hualima, Bernarda Gualusna, María Esaltación Sepi, and Luis
Yalauma for teaching me their language.
   Most of my teachers I would never have met without the help of Janeth Cayalo. She took
me with her on her motorbike every day during the beginning of my field work to find
consultants. I am deeply grateful to her.
   This leads me to other friends in Santa Ana without whom my stays there would have been
much less effective and pleasant. Elsita Asbún, Esperanza Cayalo, Sonia Rivero, and Graciela
Rodríguez helped me in all aspects of daily life and became dear friends. Olga Arteaga and
her family provided a home for me for most the time, and their parrot was my most faithful
companion and probably the only one who learned words from me. I am also indebted to
Milton Villavicencio and his wife Loida for their great hospitality.
   Outside Santa Ana, I especially want to thank Dr. Carlos Patiño Kühn in Santa Cruz for
taking my health worries off my back. Gudrun Birk is thanked for digging with me in the
APCOB library.
   Last but not least, I want to thank my parents for their strong support at all times. My
friends in Cologne took up with my unusual lifestyle with much understanding. And my
deepest gratitude is with Harald Stoffels, who accompanied me towards and throughout this
entire project, and who is the main responsible for the fact that the years of thesis writing
were very happy years.

Regional termsThe following are brief explanations of a few Spanish and regional terms that occur in some
examples.chicha

flour made of manioc, which is grated, spread in the sun for fermentation, and then toasted on
the fire; is consumed either dry together with a meal, or mixed with water as a drink. Both the
mass of grated manioc and the toasted powder can be referred to by this term. Typical of the
Movima area.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

         b. kas       din-<ra~>da=a
            NEG hard-<NMZ.N~>BE.ntr=n
            ‘It is not hard.’                                                                {JM 5, 017}Example (261) shows an interrogative clause introduced by the question word e jan ‘why’.
Here, too, the predicate receives the suffix -na:(31)     ona-ra-na=is          e -jan                   n-os        kayni-na=us
         know-BE.ntr-DR=pl.a what-CSQ                   obl-ART.n.p die-NMZ.CSQ=m.a
         ‘They knew why he died.’                                               {HR, TX 314}Note that the nominalizing suffix -na is not to be confused with the direct voice marker -na. It
is also attached to verbs containing this suffix, so that the two homophonous morphemes can
cooccur:(32)     jan     n-as       ona-waj-na:-na as                               Kochawamba
         CSQ obl-ART.n know-BE.place-DR-NMZ.CSQ                             Cochabamba
         ‘That’s why I know Cbba.’                                              {EA, Cbba 250}Verbs that receive the suffix -na after being derived through the verbalizing suffix -ni ‘PRC’,
are shown in 11.9.4. For more examples of adverbial clauses introduced by jan, see 7.12.6.
11.2. -pa nominalization of agent or location
When the suffix -pa is attached to a monovalent verbal base, it creates a noun that denotes the
entity which habitually carries out the action denoted by the base.257 When -pa is attached to a
bivalent base, the resulting noun denotes the place where the event took place. Since it is
much more common on monovalent bases, I consider agent nominalization as the central
function of this suffix. I will first describe its function on monovalent bases and turn to
bivalent bases below.
  The examples in (33)–(34) show that on monovalent verbal bases, -pa indicates that the
action is carried out habitually. The bases are monovalent because they contain an
incorporated argument (cf. 7.7, 9.1).(33)     bo        isne       jat-e -cha-ye:-pa
         REAS      PRO.f.a hit-AGT-DR2-BE.person-AG
         ‘But she habitually hits people.’ [lit.: “She is a people-hitter.”]
         {PC, Empleada 046}
257
   Apart from the nominalizing suffix described here, there are at least two more suffixes with the form -pa: the
bound nominal element for ‘hand’ (truncated from chopa ‘hand’, cf. 5.3.3) and the applicative marker -pa (cf.
9.6). While the three morphemes may be related historically, I consider them as homophonous morphemes.","[497, 498]"

(120)    jiran-kos-ni
         pretty-TRC.girl-PRC
         ‘pretty girl’                                                            {EC 1, 158}Still, the pattern may be the same as that in (117) and (118) above: the element -ya in the
noun tolkosya ‘girl’ may be a suffix which, in turn, is a truncated form of kwe:ya ‘woman’.
This is apparent, first of all, from the fact that the noun tolkosya can be replaced by the
compound tolkos-kwe:ya, which shows that there is a morpheme boundary after kos.
Furthermore, the element -ya in the noun tolkosya is by some speakers omitted in certain
constructions. This can be seen in (121)b as opposed to (121)a, which does not differ in
meaning:(121)    a. n-os          tolkos<ya:~>ya
            obl-ART.n.p girl<NMZ.N~>
            ‘when I was a young woman’                                               {EA, My life 002}         b. n-os          tol<ko:~>kos
            obl-ART.n.p girl<NMZ.N~>
            ‘when I was a young woman’                                                    {JM, Loro 001}Hence, the element -ya may have been an element which was added after the element -kos had
been established as the bound element used for anaphoric purposes. It may be related to the
element -ya in kwe:ya ‘woman’.
  The morphological truncation pattern applying to native nouns may have been extended to
loans. For example, the truncation of the loan lapise:ro ‘pen’ (from Spanish lapicero ‘pen’) as
-pis (cf. (122)) may be due to the fact that the ending -ero is recognized as a separate
morpheme:110(122)    ayru        ay           son-pis
         DM.spk.n DM.spk.n other-TRC.pen
         ‘Here I’ve got another pen.’                                                          {EA 8, 080}Thus, the truncation of polysyllabic loans can be explained by the fact that they probably
originate from compounds. This may have been what led J. Judy (1962) and Judy & Judy
(1967) to the assumption that these bound elements are actually roots.
  What remains to be investigated is whether the truncation of disyllabic loans has a
morphological origin as well. This depends on the question of whether these are historically
simple nouns or compounds. While most synchronically analysable compounds are longer (cf.
5.2), some disyllabic nouns can still be analysed. The clearest cases are nouns like nonlo
‘milk’ or chojlo ‘urine’, which are obviously composed a verb root (non- ‘suckle’ and choj-
‘urinate’, respectively) and the classificatory bound root -lo ‘liquid’. Therefore, probably, the
cross-referencing bound element -lo is better analysed as the classifying bound root, as in
(123)a, than as a truncated element, as in (123)b:110
    Probably , the bound element -pis is the result of the truncation of la:pis (from Spanish lapiz) ‘pencil’, and
this element is also used to cross-refer to the longer word lapisero ‘pen’.","[241, 242]"

are narrated that took place in the speaker’s childhood or in a dream. This function is possibly
related to the indication of hearsay knowledge (cf. (183)–(185)). Example (191) is from a
dream narration, example (192) is from a childhood narration:(191)    an jankwa ney in a,               yey-na, pa’,

(188)–(190) above. The utterance is usually marked as a question by intonation (cf. 2.8.5).(193)   ja’ josi-ka-poj-kay-a=n               i’ne     an ay’ku

12.4. The focus particle kaw
The construction with kaw (often pronounced as kwey, see further below) was already
discussed in 7.8. It is a focus marker, the most salient property of which is to reduce the
valency of a bivalent verb. It thereby enables the former ARG1 to occur as the absolutive
argument in topic position. In addition, kaw has another, possessor-marking function. In this
section, I will first describe the possessor-marking function of kaw. After that, I discuss the
difference between this particle and the often homophonous tense particle kwey (cf. 12.2.1).
  The possessor-marking function of kaw may be related to its focalizing function described
in 7.8 (and cf. below for further examples). In this function, illustrated in (197) and (198), it
precedes a noun which is a generic term for the possessed entity. Together, the two words
denote the possessor of the entity. The possessum can be specified by an oblique noun phrase,
underlined in the following examples:(197)    is        mere’ ko’ kis              neyru, o’im, o’im-vos

         ‘The cows [...] didn’t have cut ears because they didn’t have an owner.’
         [lit.: “there was no domestic-animal-owner of them.’] {GB, Ganado 004}Curiously, the possessor-denoting expression with kaw is most often found as a lexical
expression in combination with the oblique-marked first person singular pronoun in a:(199)     kaw     n-in a
        ~ kwey    n-in a
          FOC     obl-PRO.1sg
          ‘owner’Also with this expression, the possessum can be specified by an oblique-marked noun phrase
(as in (197) and (198) above):(200)    bo       as      iy’ i-ni-wa            kwey    n-in a      n-as       akamba

The expression kwey nin a ‘owner’ occurs twice in (202) below. In this example, it can be
seen that the possessive-marking function of kaw can sometimes not be formally
distinguished from its focus function. Here, it occurs with the word asna ‘home’, which is
morphologically a verb. I will elaborate on this phrase below.(202)   di:ra tochi’ kwaj-na=y’ i kos            sinko-pe:so n-i’nes     kwey n-in a

        ART.f Modesta        PRO.f FOC obl-PRO.1sg obl-ART.n water
        ‘At least we give a small five pesos to the owner of the water of the tap, she is the
        owner of the house here [lit.: “she is the one who sits here”], Modesta, she is the
        owner of the water.’                                    {EA, Agua sucia 020}The phrase i’ne kwey asna ney in this example can be translated in two ways: as ‘she is the
one who sits here’ or, more appropriate in this context, as ‘she is the owner of the house here’.
The first translation is literal, while the second takes the lexicalized meaning of the word
asna, ‘home’, as basis. This example, where the category of a word oscillates between verb
and noun, shows that possessive marking may have developed out of the focus-marking
function.
  As could be seen in the examples so far, the focus particle has two variants: kaw and kwey.
Some speakers always use kwey, others generally use kaw and sometimes kwey. When asked,
speakers confirm the exchangeability of the forms:(203)       iy’ i      kaw        sal-na
        ~   iy’ i      kwey       sal-na
            PRO.1pl FOC           search-DR
            ‘We look for it.’                                                {ER 11, 015}For the tense particle kwey (cf. 12.2.1), there is no variant kaw. Therefore, I refer to the focus
particle as kaw. However, since the two particles are often homophonous, I will point out their
differences here.
  Apart from the fact that kaw can be realized as kwey, but not the other way round, the
particles differ in that the tense particle kwey is realized as kweyka in certain cases, as in
(204). In contrast, for the particle kaw this is not possible, as shown by (205)b.(204)   bo        jayna kweyka      ji:sa   kos      konvokato:riya
        REAS      DSC IMM           make ART.n.a announcement

the behaviour of bivalent verbs. The tense particle kwey (cf. (206)) typically occurs in clause-
initial position, while in a clause with kaw, this position is usually occupied by a free pronoun
(underlined):(206)   kwey in        ji<wa:~>wa
        IMM 1intr come<MD~>
        ‘I came earlier today.’                                             {EA, Visita 031}(207)   jayna isne        kwey joy-che
        DSC PRO.f.a FOC go-R/R
        ‘Then she will go.’                                                 {EA, Dial. 029}The particle kaw is found most often with bivalent verbs. It reduces the syntactic valency of
the verb. This means that the original ARG1 becomes the intransitive argument, encoded by a
free pronoun in topic position. The original ARG2 becomes an oblique argument, marked by
n- (cf. 7.6, 7.8). In contrast, with the tense particle, the valency of the verb is retained. The
difference can be seen in (208)a and b, respectively:(208)   a. kaw: focus, valency reduction:
           i’ne    kwey toroj-na       n-as      ro:ya
           PRO.f FOC dust-DR           obl-ART.n house
           ‘She has dusted the house.’                                        {EA 19, 248a}        b. kwey: no focus, valency retention:

           ‘She has dusted the house today.’                                     {EA 19, 248b}The following examples, which are variations of (208)a and b above, show that focus and
valency reduction indeed go together. Example (209)a shows that when the verb remains
bivalent, ARG1 cannot be put in focus. Example (209)b, in contrast, shows that when there is
no free pronoun in topic position, the valency of the verb cannot be reduced:(209)   a. ungrammatical: focus, no valency reduction:
          * i’ne    kwey toroj-na=‘ne as           ro:ya
            PRO.f ?         dust-DR=f     ART.n house
            (‘She has dusted the house.’)                                     {EA 19, 248c}
                                                                                             539
         b. ungrammatical: no focus, but valency reduction:
           * kwey toroj-na       n-as         ro:ya
             ?       dust-DR     obl-ART.n house
             (‘X has dusted the house today.’)                                      {EA 19, 248d}Another difference between the two constructions concerns intonation. The word kwey can
only be stressed when it is the tense marker, as in (206). In the case of the focus particle kaw,
as in (207), stress always falls on the free pronoun, not on the particle.
  The question is whether the focus particle kaw and the tense particle kwey have anything in
common, since the focus particle kaw is pronounced as kwey by many speakers. The
translations of some clauses that contain the focus particle suggest that this particle implies
past tense as well. A case of this type is given in (210):(210)    u’ko    kwey loj-na=u          kis               sapato=u
         PRO.m FOC wash-DR=m ART.pl.a                     shoe=m
         ‘He has just washed his shoes.’                                               {NG 10, 076e}However, unlike the tense particle kwey, the focus particle kaw can be found in contexts
which exclude a past-tense reading. This can be seen when other tense particles or adverbial
clauses are involved. The three following examples are marked for future tense, incompatible
with the past-tense particle kwey, which implies the occurrence of an event before the moment
of speaking. Here, the form kwey can only represent the focus particle kaw. In (211), the
particles nokowa ‘right now’ (cf. 12.2.4) and loy ‘intentional’ (cf. 12.3.2) indicate future
tense:272(211)    jay e nokowa        loy ney=s           imay-ni,
         then right_now      ITN here=DET night-PRC

         ‘So now in the night, this [dog] will watch over the dried meat [not the other one].’
        {JM, Perro II 020}In (212), the event referred to is a habitual action, and the particle nokowa ‘right now’
indicates future tense (cf. 12.2.4):(212)    ka’       jayna      rujalniwa:-wa     n-as       as-na=n

As can be seen, the roots alone indicate the shape or consistency of an entity, while the
independent nouns denote a more specific type of entity. The following are examples of
compounds containing bound roots of this type:(82)    a. kape              ‘coffee (in any form)’
        b. kape:-lo          ‘coffee (for drinking)’    (lo ‘BR.liquid’)
        c. kape:-vas         ‘coffee powder’            (vas ‘BR.flour’)(83)    a. mo’incho      ‘chivé (powder of toasted, fermented manioc)’
        b. mo’incho:-ba ‘chivé cake’                (ba ‘BR.round’)
        c. mo’incho:-bun ‘chivé mass’               (bun ‘BR.mass’)Some bound roots can function both as markers of shape/consistency and of natural class. For
example, the bound root ba ‘BR.round, cylindric’, besides specifying a noun with respect to
the shape of the denoted entity (cf. (83)), also denotes the natural class of roundish objects.
Accordingly, nouns which by themselves denote a roundish object do not take the suffix -ba.
Here, as could already be seen in (80)a, the bound root can function as a cross-referencing
device on the predicate:(84)    jayna    don-ba:-ni             as maropa
        DSC      rot-BR.round-PRC ART.n papaya
        ‘The papaya is already rotten.’                                        {JM 3, 283b}(85)    way-na=‘ne     os         sota’-ba di’ jo -kwa

        ‘She took away the only egg.’                    {EA, Huevo 004}As was already observed by J. Judy (1962) and Grinevald (2002), the bound roots presented
here are classificatory elements: they signal the form and consistency and/or the natural class
of an entity.
  Idiomatic use of these elements is also found. For example, the bound root di ‘seed’
sometimes functions as a diminutive suffix (not productively however):(86)    awaro:-di              ‘little parrot’         (parrot-BR.grain)
        siya:-di               ‘little chair’          (chair-BR.grain)
        walacho:-di            ‘little stream’         (stream-BR.grain)The bound root toda ‘BR.piece’ preserves its literal meaning when combined with nouns like
those in (87), which denote entities that can be divided into parts:(87)    wa:ka-to:da            ‘meat; beef’               (cow-BR.piece)
        rulrul-to:da           ‘jaguar meat’              (jaguar-BR.piece)
        bote:liya-to:da        ‘piece of glass’           (bottle-BR.piece)
        do’ewanoj-to:da        ‘piece of cloth’           (cloth-BR.piece)                                                                                           211
In the nouns in (88), however, the bound root toda ‘BR.piece’ indicates in a derogatory way
that the entity referred to is old.(88)       roya-to:da               ‘dilapidated house’          (house-BR.piece)
           mo:to-to:da              ‘wrecked motorbike’          (motorbike-BR.piece)
           sapato-to:da             ‘old, worn-out shoes’        (shoe-BR.piece)When the referent can neither be divided nor be described as old, the noun cannot be
combined with toda:(89)       *chammo-toda               (bush-BR.piece)
           *tomi-toda                 (water-BR.piece)
           *bachi-toda                (nose-BR.piece)A question which arises with respect to the elements listed in (81) is the following: is the
classificatory element (e.g. ba ‘BR.round) a semantically bleached version of the independent
noun (ba~ba:-kwa ‘fruit’)? Or is the narrower semantic scope of the independent noun a
result of lexicalization? The first possibility would correspond to the way in which classifier
systems usually develop (cf. Craig 1994). However, as was shown above for cases where the
suffix -kwa derives a noun from an otherwise independent root (cf. (75)), the meaning of the
derived noun can be different and more specific than that of the root alone. In analogy to
those nouns, I analyse the nouns with -kwa containing a classificatory root as lexicalized
cases, too:103(90)       ba~ba:-kwa
           RED~BR.round-ABS
           ‘fruit’5.3.3. Truncation
When combined with another lexical base (in compounding, cf. 5.2, or noun incorporation, cf.
9.1, 9.2), many nouns occur in a truncated form, a phenomenon identified by Grinevald
(2002). This concerns a number of indigenous nouns, as well as some loans.
  The morphological characteristic of elements truncated from indigenous nouns is that they
are homophonous with a particular segment, typically the final syllable, of a corresponding

There are two words which seem to be bivalent verbs, because they are mainly used as
predicates and the actor is encoded by an internal clitic or, if it is a speech-act participant, by a
pronoun of Set 1. However, they do not have a bivalent voice marker, and in fact, they are
better analysed as nouns (cf. also 3.10.2). These words are jankwa ‘say’ and jampa ‘do like’.
The following examples illustrate them:(140)    jayna     jankwa ney,          é a kos         yey-na=n
         DSC       say         here    what ART.n want-DR=2

         ‘If you want (it), then we’ll do it (like that).’                  {GB, Ganado 037}The following examples illustrate the occurrence of these words in an NP. As can be seen, the
concepts they denote are the thing being said and the way in which something is done:(142)    jay e jayna iwa:ni--is      n-as        kaste

         ‘She took them with her and she’ll send them, like you did back then.’
         {EA, Visita 112}If analysed as bivalent verbs, these words are unusual: they do not contain a voice marker, as
do all other bivalent verbs, and their undergoer is never overtly expressed. Consequently, they352
cannot be used in the inverse voice. It is more adequate to analyse these words not as verbs,
but as nouns. This is supported by the way in which they receive further derivational suffixes:
they are first verbalized by the suffix -ni, and then receive a verbal suffix. The following
examples illustrate action nominalization in subordinate clauses (cf. 7.12, 11.1):(144)    jayna     n-os          jankwa-ni-wa=‘ne, kus              alkaka:ye ...

         NEG do_like-PRC-NMZ=f.a
         ‘She didn’t do it like that.’                                               {EA, Siesta 023}The next example shows the same phenomenon in the imperative form of jankwa:(146)    jankwa-ni-ki         no-kos      yey-na=n
         say-PRC-IMP.MV       obl-ART.n.a want-DR=2

into an element jan and an element -kwa and -pa, respectively. The element jan may be
identical or related to the root jan- in question words (cf. 3.10.6). The elements -kwa and -pa
may be related to the noun root kwa ‘BR.mouth’ and, by truncation, to the noun chopa ‘hand’,
respectively.204 However, these relations are purely etymological. Therefore, I simply
translate these words as verbs, i.e. as ‘say’ and ‘do like’, respectively.","[374, 375, 376]"

          ‘I’ve already finished cleaning the table.’                            {EA 13, 012}There is only one phonological difference with the intensifying suffix: the root mas- ‘beat’ is
not combined with a special allomorph -o’ (cf. 10.6, example (120) above). Instead, like other
roots containing /a/, it takes the suffix -u’:(166)   jayna in       ba:-mas-u’       n-us           dichi:ye
        DSC 1intr finish-beat-PH obl-ART.m             child
        ‘I finished beating the child.’                                      {EA, 13, 040}The fact that the root mas- ‘beat’ behaves regularly here, unlike in the case of the intensifying
derivation described above, is one reason to consider the phasal suffix as different from the
intensifying suffix, even though they may have the same origin. Another reason is that the
two can cooccur, as I will show in 10.7.3 below.
  The question is what the phasal suffix -u’/-ay’, which probably has a common origin with
the homophonous intensifying suffix, actually contributes to the phasal verb. One possibility
is that it expresses duration: an aspect-neutral verb root is first derived for durative aspect so458
that it can, subsequently, be incorporated into a phasal verb. This is suggested by the fact that
any verb root can be derived in this way, also those roots which denote inherently punctual
(as in (167)) or telic events. The comment of speakers in this case is usually that the event has
taken place several times.(167)      jayna      in       ba:-suy-ay’             n-us         dichi:ye

           ‘I’ve finished taking it away from the boy (repeatedly).’                        {EA 13, 094a}If the phasal suffixes imply duration, this may be the historical connection with the
intensifying suffixes, which, however, usually do not have a durative meaning.
  As was mentioned above, all phasal verbs are monovalent. This can be seen from the fact
that these verbs cannot take more than one core argument, which is encoded by an externally
cliticized bound pronoun or by a bound SAP-pronoun of Set 2. Also, when marked as
imperative, these verbs are combined with the monovalent imperative suffix -ki:(168)      nan-sam-u’-ki                            jayna

is the case with other monovalent bases (cf. 8.7). The following is an example of a
nominalized phasal verb (a similar example was given in (151)):(169)      jayna      rey   n-os           ba:-’il-ay’-wa=sne        n-is        mo’incho

these verbs, this suffix indicates that the result of the action is reached, but that the agent is
unknown or irrelevant.(170)      ba:-’il-uk-e

      Note that when the vowel-initial suffix -e follows, the allomorph -u’ is realized as /uk/; in contrast, the
glottal stop of the allomorph -ay’ in word-final position is dropped: it is realized as /aj/. This is due to the
properties of the phoneme /j /, described in 2.2.","[480, 481, 482]"

        ‘This is why he won’t reach [them] now.’              {EA, Alcanzar 035}That the presential article indicates a non-past event with action nominals can be seen when
comparing (139) above with (140) below. In (140), the choice of the absential article indicates
that the event took place on the same day, but before the moment of speaking.(140)   jan      no-kos        loy         nokowa ba:-lowes-na-na=us
        CSQ obl-ART.n.a NEG.SUB now                 finish-BE.time-DR-NMZ.CSQ=m.a
        ‘This is why he hasn’t reached [them] now.’                 {JM 17, 294}These examples show that the absential article, which indicates physical absence of concrete
referents (cf. 4.8.1), indicates a temporal category with nouns encoding times or events.
  Alternatively, it could be surmised that there is a connection between the presence or
absence of the participant(s) in the event referred to, and the choice of the referential element.
However, example (141) below shows that this does not seem to be the case. Even though the
actor of the action nominal onaranawa ‘knowing’ is present (as is indicated by the presential
bound pronoun =u), the noun is combined with the absential article. Likewise, the action
nominal jiwawa ‘coming’ receives the presential even though the agent is absent (indicated by
the absential bound pronoun =sne).(141)   yey-na=u      kos       ona-ra-na-wa=u              as      é -lomaj

        ART.n come-NMZ=f.a
        ‘He (present) wanted to know when she (absent) will come.’ {EA, Llamada 006}The choice of the articles in this example can only be explained with their tense-marking
function. The event of “wanting to know” (the father, who is present, called his daughter on
the phone) took place on the day of speaking, therefore the absential article. The event of
“coming” takes place in the future, hence the presential article both before the temporal noun
e lomaj ‘when’ and the action noun jiwawa=sne ‘her (absent) coming’.
  Another point concerning the role of the absential article with action nouns is its behaviour
with nominalized verbs of directed motion. Does the absential article perhaps encode spatial
location of the actor here, instead of encoding the temporal relation of the event to the
moment of speaking? The answer is no, as the following example shows. Here, the agent is
the speaker herself and the motion encoded by the verb has led toward the place of speaking.","[191, 192]"

2.4.    Assimilation of nasals
The alveolar nasal phoneme /n/ always assimilates to the following consonant with respect to
its place of articulation: it is realized as [m] before a bilabial consonant and as [ ] before a
velar consonant. This can be represented as follows:(98)    /n/       [m]   / __ C [+bilabial]
                  [ ]   / __ C [+velar]The behaviour of /n/ before different consonants is illustrated in (99)a–c:(99)    a. /'ento/          [' nt ]          ‘to stand obliquely’
        b. /'enpoh/         [' mp h]         ‘to be made stand’
        c. /'enki/          ['  ki]          ‘Stand up!’Some speakers realize /n/ as [ ] in coda position when the following onset consonant is /n/ as
well (cf. (100)). This dissimilation signals syllable boundaries.(100)   /'enna/ [' nna] ~ ['    na] ‘where I stand’Unlike /n/, the bilabial nasal, /m/, does usually not assimilate to its environment. In (101)a, it
occurs before the alveolar, and in (101)b, before the velar plosive:(101)   a. /rim'tik/           [ im'ti i]    ‘to do the shopping’
        b. /'amki/             [' amki]      ‘Come in!’In the speech of some speakers, however, /m/ is realized as a velar nasal before a velar
consonant, as in (102). Here, /m/ is indistinguishable from /n/.(102)   /'amki/    [' a ki] ‘Come in!’As far as assimilation is concerned, the nasalized coda allophone of /t/, [t n] (cf. 2.3.1),
behaves in the same way as the alveolar nasal phoneme /n/: [t n] is realized as [p m] before a
bilabial consonant and as [k ] before a velar consonant. Hence, the syllable-final variants of
/t/ are as follows:34
(103)   /t/      [p m] / __ .C [+bilabial]
                 [k ] / __ .C [+velar]
                 [t n] / __ . (elsewhere)The realization of /t/ as a nasalized stop with simultaneous bilabial and velar closure,
respectively, is shown in (104)a and b:(104)   a. /tat' o:se /      [tap m' :s ]        ‘to fall down’
        b. /'batki/          [' ak ki]           ‘Get seated (on top of something)!’Note that in cases such as (104)a, the distinction between /t/ and /p/ is neutralized. In contrast,
/t/ does not become identical with /k/ before a velar consonant (cf. (104)b), since /k/ is
realized as a simple glottal stop and not accompanied by a velar closure.
   In cases such as (104)a, where the phonemic distinction between /t/ and /p/ is neutralized,
the underlying phoneme can be identified when a vowel-initial morpheme is attached to it (cf.
also 2.3.1 above, examples (63)–(69)). In this way, example (105) shows that the morpheme
realized as [p m] in (104) is, in fact, /t/:(105)    /tata' o:se /     [tata'   :s ]       ‘I make X fall down.’
2.5.    Nasalization of vowels
Nasalization of vowels is not a phonemic phenomenon. Progressive nasal assimilation can
occur when the following consonant is a nasal, as in (106), or a nasalized stop, as in (107):(106)   /be'benkwa/      [ '    kwa]         ‘hide, leather’
(107)   /bu'butkwa/      [ u' uk kwa]        ‘mud’Only one word contains nasal vowels which are not followed by a nasal or nasalized
consonant:(108)   /ho:'hok/        [h :'h     ]        ‘yes’This interjection is often pronounced with closed lips, so that the vowels are replaced by a
syllabic nasal consonant:(109)   [hm:'hm m]                           ‘yes’
                                                                                                35
2.6.    Aspiration of /s/ and / /
The phoneme /s/ can be realized as [h] in coda position. This only concerns the final
consonant of the articles (cf. 4.4), shown in (110)a for the article /as/, and of the negative
particle /kas/ (cf. 12.5), shown in (110)b.(110)   a. /as        'pa:ko/                       b. /kas     'hojwa/
           ART.n dog                                   NEG go:NMZ
           [ as 'pa:k ] ~ [ ah 'pa:k ]                 [kas 'h jwa] ~ [kah 'h jwa]
           ‘the/a dog’                                 ‘I don’t go.’The variation of [s] and [h] in these morphemes depends on the speaker. Some speakers
consistently pronounce them with a final [h], unless they precedes a word starting in [s] or
[t ]. In (111), this is shown for the article /is/ before the word /t i'na a/ ‘manioc’:(111)   /is t i'na a/    [ is t i'na a]               ‘(the) manioc’Other speakers pronounce these words with a final [s] in all environments.
  The fact that /s/ and /h/ are otherwise phonemically distinct in coda position, was shown by
the minimal pair in (37) above, which is repeated here:(112)   /as' aba /      [ as' a a ]       ‘to sit on the ground’
        /ah' aba /      [ ah' a a ]       ‘to go by foot’The phoneme / / is also often realized as [h]. This is particularly the case when it constitutes
the proclitic marking the first person (cf. 4.1). The phoneme / / is often realized as [h] when
the proclitic occurs before a relational noun (cf. Ch. 6) or before a bivalent verb. These cases
are illustrated by (113) and (114), respectively. In both cases, the first person is implicit and
therefore not necessarily overtly encoded (cf. 6.1 and 7.4).(113)   /a       'de:na/
        ART.n.1 lie:DR
        [ a ' :na] ~ [ ah '       :na]
        ‘my bed’(114)   /i 'salna/
        1 search:DR
        [ i 'salna] ~ [ ih 'salna]
        ‘I look for something.’However, /h/ and / / are phonemically distinct. This becomes apparent when a non-relational
noun with a first person singular possessor, as in (115)a, is contrasted with an unpossessed
non-relational noun, as in (115)b (cf. also 6.3):

Apart from the monovalent roots which take the suffix -che when occurring as the predicate
of an intransitive clause, there are monovalent roots which are not combined with -che , but
with other, sometimes nonproductive affixes. There seems to be a clear semantic basis for
these classes as well. I will briefly illustrate them in the following subsections. Like the roots
described here, these roots are defined as monovalent by the fact that the suffix -na
establishes a location as undergoer.
8.3.2.1. -kwa ‘bodily processes’
Some monovalent roots are regularly combined with the non-productive suffix -kwa. The
resulting verbs denote events which can be subsumed under the term “involuntary bodily
processes”:(88)     joro:-kwa           ‘sleep’
         beysi:-kwa          ‘dream’
         maw-’i-n-kwa        ‘be hungry’
         achis-kwa           ‘sneeze’
         jowo:-kwa           ‘cough’
         jalay-kwa           ‘yawn’
          e’-kwa             ‘have the hickup’199
         roson-kwa           ‘pass wind’
         choj-kwa            ‘urinate’
         momo:-kwa           ‘defecate’
         lel-kwa             ‘vomit’
         res-kwa             ‘burp’The following examples illustrate their use:(89)     chi:~chi--sne      n-os          i:may            choj-kwa
         MD~go_out--f.a obl-ART.n.p night                  urinate-BDP
         ‘She went out at night and urinated.’                                         {SY, serpiente 002}(90)     jema’ da’            roson-kwa,       puwo:,                puwo:
         also     DUR.nst pass_wind-BDP ONOM                         ONOM
         ‘[I] was also passing winds, “puwo, puwo”.’                                 {EA, Gallina 004}That these roots are monovalent can be seen from the fact that when the suffix -na is attached,
it establishes a location as undergoer, not a patient:200199
   The root ek- ‘kick’ is the only one which is also found as a bivalent root (cf. 8.3.1).
200
   However, the root joro- ‘sleep’ can occur with the inverse marker. This has only been found in combination
with the particle mo: 'not yet' (cf. 12.5.3): mo: joro:-kay kos jowo-kwa-n-wa ‘My coughing (last night) hadn’t let
me sleep yet.’ (yet sleep-INV ART.n.a sleep-BDP-LN-NMZ)
342
(91)    asko       joro-na=‘ne      jay e, jo:jo’
        DM.n.a sleep-DR=f           then    yes
        ‘That (is) where she will sleep then, yes.’                 {EA, Alojamiento 011}These roots have many morphological characteristics of nouns. First of all, some of the roots
can occur independently, as nouns (cf. (92)). Like nouns or bound nominal elements, they can
also be incorporated (cf. (93)):(92)    as maw-’i         ‘(the) hunger’    (-‘i ‘D’)
        as beysi          ‘the/a dream’
        as jo’wo          ‘the/a cough’(93)    kayni:-maw        ‘to die of hunger’
        jayaw-jo:ro       ‘to sleep well’Secondly, there is also a nominal suffix -kwa (the absolute-state marker on nominal bases; cf.
5.3.2, 6.5). It is possible that the suffix -kwa on the verbs above can be traced back to the
same origin.
  Another nounlike property of these verbs is that they can be nominalized in the same way as
nouns, i.e., not by suffixation of -wa, but by reduplication (cf. 3.10.2, 11.1):(94)    no-ko         maw-’i-n-<kwa:~>kwa,    in    de<ja:~>jal
        obl-ART.n.a.1 hunger-D-LN-<NMZ.N~>BDP 1intr cook<MD~>
        ‘When I was hungry, I cooked.’                     {JM 18, 114}Usually, however, under nominalization the suffix -kwa is omitted and -wa is added, as is the
case with other monovalent bases (cf. 8.7.1 below):(95)    bo       as         joro:-wa        jayna
        REAS ART.n sleep-NMZ                DSC
        ‘in order to sleep already’                                     {EA, Ay’ku II 019}
8.3.2.2. -a ‘sensation’
Five verb roots were encountered that are regularly combined with a suffix -a ‘SNS’, which
does not occur on other bases. The resulting verbs denote an emotional or sensory state:(96)    bele:k-a      ‘to be happy, glad’
        sutu:k-a      ‘to be angry’
        tino:k-a      ‘to be scared’
        tayo:k-a      ‘to feel hot’
        jilo:k-a      ‘to feel cold’
                                                                                          343
The following examples illustrate the use of these verbs:(97)    ban rey in         tino:k-a   in a
        but again 1intr fear-SNS PRO.1sg
        ‘But I was scared, you know.’                                 {EA, Jaguar 124}(98)    jayna     bele:k-a    is     ney bito’o
        DSC       glad-SNS ART.pl here old_person
        ‘Then the old people were happy.’                       {EM, Gringas II 015}As on other monovalent roots, the direct voice marker -na establishes a location as undergoer
on these verbs. It is attached to the entire base with -a:(99)    tinok-a:-na      jayson
        fear-SNS-DR seem
        ‘It seemed that at that place I was scared.’                  {JA, TX 071}Like the verb roots combined with -kwa described above, these roots may have a nominal
origin. This is apparent from the fact that when they do not denote a sensory or emotional
state, they are combined with the verbalizing suffix -ni (cf. 11.9):(100)   jayson    chonlomaj       tino’-ni       os       ney je:mes
        seem      really          fear-PRC       ART.n.p here day

        {EA 8, 082a}(102)   bo        ay          rey jayna jilo’-ni,        bo        jayna rey

        ‘Because it was already cold, because there was a strong wind last night.’
        {EA, Antes de fiesta 049}The combination of these roots with -ni is not fully productive, however. For example, the
verb root sutu’ ‘to be angry’ cannot be combined with -ni:(103)   *sutu’-ni        (‘to be annoying’)Thus, some of the roots in (96) are lexicalized together with the suffix -a ‘SNS’, since the
suffix -a cannot be replaced by another suffix.","[364, 365, 366, 367]"

be combined with a second causative suffix, as shown in (118). This indicates that the agent
is, in turn, caused to carry out the event.(118)   loy i       ok-a-poj-poj-na            u’ko      n-as      ko’

to tell the semantic difference between a bivalent verb containing the causative suffix and a
bivalent verb containing the direct voice marker only. It might be expected that the causative
form is used when the undergoer is animate or has a larger amount of control. For example, in
the causative form in (115) above, the undergoer is animate, while in (119) below, where the
root am- is combined with the direct marker only, the undergoer is inanimate:(119)   am-na=sne         no-kos        balde-to:da         di’ pe -cho         ney

         {EA, Motacu 014}There are at least two roots, cho’es ‘dirty, ugly’ and jiran ‘pretty’, on which the causative
seems to have a more idiomatic meaning, and where it usually only occurs in an inverse verb.

consisting of a root or a root plus a voice suffix, thereby creating a complex base. However,
the causative suffix can also be attached to a base that is already complex. One example of
this could be seen in (118) above. Example (123) shows the causative suffix attached to a
complex base containing an incorporated modifier. In (123)a, the base is monovalent, in
(123)b, it is bivalent (cf. 8.4):(123)     a. kam-pin-poj-na                          b. kat-a-pin-poj-na

As was said in the previous section, when the suffix -poj is attached to a bivalent base, the
causee is encoded by an unmarked and the patient by an oblique argument.224 This relation is
reversed when an additional suffix is added to the causative base: -as, which I call “causative
inverse”. The pair in (125) illustrates this. In the simple causative construction in (125)a, the
causee is encoded by an unmarked NP and the patient by an oblique NP. In (125)b, where the
causative verb contains the marker -as, the unmarked NP encodes the patient, while the
causee is marked as oblique.225(125)     a. jayna kino’ leve-na-poj-na                kinos     a:na

180).

        ‘They walk.’In Table 9 above, two alternative forms are given for the presential bound pronouns: one with
a final glottal stop and one without a glottal stop. Since the glottal stop is present in the
presential free pronouns (e.g. u’ko ‘he’), I take this to be the underlying form. The presence of
the glottal stop in the bound pronoun depends on the final phoneme of the host: when the host
ends in a vowel, the glottal stop is omitted (cf. 2.3.3). This can be seen in (17) (internal
cliticization) and (18) (external cliticization):(17)    joy-a- e=u

        ‘He (present) takes X with him.’(18)    ilo:ni--u

    determiner”). The first two functions are described in Ch. 7 (7.3.3 and 7.9.4, respectively); the
    latter function is illustrated in section 4.4 below. The pragmatic categories encoded by the
    demonstratives are described in detail in section 4.9.","[159, 160, 161]"
"These variants are illustrated in (95). Notice that there are two examples of H-reduplication:
in (95) a., reduplication concerns a closed, and in (95)b, a long open syllable.(95)     a.   kar~karso:ne                      ‘to own trousers’         POSS~trousers (H)

the second choice leading to disyllabic (LL or LH) reduplication. In most disyllabic words44
  In a negative or subordinate clause, the argument is encoded in the same way as the possessor. Therefore, in
(93)a, the plural bound pronoun refers to the bees and in (93)b to the honey (a mass noun, cf. 4.7.2).",[113]

The particle jan introduces an adverbial clause, which is formally an oblique NP (cf. 7.12.3).
The special property of this construction is that the predicate of the adverbial clause is not
nominalized through -wa or reduplication (cf. 11.1.1), but through a suffix -na, which only
occurs in this particular construction (cf. 11.1.3). Consider the following example:(37)     jan     n-os         tes-na=sne,           bo       jayna rey
         CSQ obl-ART.n.p limp-NMZ.CSQ=f.a REAS DSC again

         ‘That’s why she limped, because her thigh was broken here.’ {EA, Ay’ku I 011}
508
Often, a clause containing jan is preceded by the particle bo ‘because’. This does not seem to
influence the meaning.(38)    bo        jan     n-os           jisa-na-na=is          enona=y’ i

12.1.8. The preposition o:be ‘like’
The particle o:be precedes an NP or a pronoun which denotes an entity with which another
entity is compared. Unlike the subordinating particles described above (e.g. bo ‘so that’), the
NP preceded by o:be typically contains not a nominalized predicate, but an ordinary noun.
This particle is therefore best described as a preposition.
  In (42), o:be introduces a noun phrase, in (43) a free pronoun, and in (44) a demonstrative
(underlined):(42)    wurul-che --as o:be           is       bana:ma
        roar-R/R--n.a       like      ART.pl   anteater

        ‘The door was like that one [half-open].’                        {EA, Escape 038}In (45) below, the NP following the particle o:be contains a nominalized predicate. This
clause qualifies the predicate of the preceding clause (tivijniwa ‘hurting’), which is itself an
adverbial clause of the type described in 7.12.3.(45)    asko      n-os          jayna tivij-ni-wa=os                dimpoj-a=sne

12.2.     Tense and aspect particles
It is not easy to distinguish the categories tense, aspect and mood as indicated by particles.
Temporal and aspectual categories are difficult to distinguish, and some particles with an
aspectual function can also be used as markers of mood. Therefore, I subsume tense and
aspect particles under one heading, and some of them will be described again in the section on
modal and epistemic particles (12.3).
   The position of the TAM-particles in the clause, and the relation between their position and
their scope, requires further research. It seems that in principle, a particle can occur at any
position in the clause:(46)    (TAM) TOP (TAM) PRED (TAM) ARG (TAM)Strikingly, these particles occur very often within an NP, i.e., between the article and the
noun:(47)    ART (TAM) NIn the following sections, I will indicate for each particle whether it can occur within an NP.
Further research is needed to establish the frequency of certain particles in that position, and
what this means for their scope properties.
  Many TAM-particles have a long form with the ending -ka. This form usually occurs at the
margins of the clause. The existence of a long form will also be indicated for each particle
individually.","[529, 530, 531, 532, 533]"

that when functioning as the predicate of a negative or subordinate clause, adjectives also
undergo infixing reduplication. Examples (12) and (13) illustrate this.(12)        n-os          ja<ya~>yaw-a=a,         a’ko=     as-na,     a’ko=        joro:-na

negative or subordinate clause, whose applicability indicates a subtle difference between
nouns and verbs. This concerns the suffixation of - e.255 Examples (14) and (15) show that
reduplication and the suffixation of - e are, in principle, equivalent. Due to this equivalence, I
also gloss the suffix - e as ‘NMZ.N’.(14)         a. kas         cho<’e~>’es-a=a

10.3.     The irrealis marker <a’> or -RED~-a’
As described in 3.6.2, the irrealis infix <a’>, realized as <ka’> after a vowel, is inserted after
the first iambic foot of the base. It signals irrealis mood in affirmative contexts and participant
negation in negative contexts. As an irrealis marker, it indicates that the speaker considers it
unimportant when exactly the event takes place, but assures that it will take place eventually.
Consider the following examples of the irrealis marker on monovalent verbs:(55)    sal<a’>mo
        return<IRR>
        ‘I’ll be back!’(56)    dol-a’-mi             as        balde

        ‘May it eat, it’s your pet!’ [hen picking maize from a basin]         {EA 14, 069}The following examples contain bivalent verbs with the irrealis marker in affirmative clauses:(58)    in a       kwey puy-a’-na

        ‘I’ll hem it.’ [i.e., leave it to me!]                                   {EA 13, 291a}

        {EA, Makina 013}Since the irrealis marker has a future implication, it is often combined with the TAM-particles
nokowa and loy (cf. 12.2.4 and 12.3.2, respectively):(60)    loy i         nokowa       ji<ka’>sa:-na

of existential negation: it negates the existence of the primary participant, i.e. the one encoded
by the absolutive argument. This is identical to its negative function on predicate nominals
(cf. 7.15.1).(61)    kas   tij-a’-ka:rim

then usually apparent from the context. In this case, the irrealis marker implies negation. The
following are examples from a dialogue:(65)    sal<a’>mo-kwa:-na        rey     jayna

        ‘[They] don’t feel pain.’ [lit: “Nothing hurts.”]           {AH, Dial. EA&AH 023}Strikingly, the irrealis marker negates the existence of the participant established by the voice
properties of the base (cf. 8.1). Compare, for example, the irrealis forms in (65)–(66) above
with the corresponding unmarked forms in (68)–(70), respectively. These take an absolutive
argument:(68)    salmo-kwa:-na--sne
        return-BEN-DR--f.a
        ‘I return for her.’ [i.e., for her benefit](69)    suy-kay-a=sne--kus

        ‘It hurts.’In a negative clause, a predicate that contains the irrealis marker cannot cooccur with a
pronoun or NP that refers to the participant whose existence is negated. In an affirmative
clause, in contrast, a predicate that contains the irrealis marker can cooccur with the
absolutive argument. Hence, in addition to the presence or absence of the negative particle
kas, the realization of the absolutive argument formally identifies an irrealis-marked verb as
an affirmative predicate. Compare the negative irrealis clause, marked by kas, in (71)a with
the affirmative clause, containing a pronoun that encodes the absolutive argument, in (71)b:440

overtly expressed, their absence is not an unmistakable signal of either the affirmative or the
negative interpretation. The following expression, for example, has two possible
interpretations, depending on the context:(72)    dewaj-a’-na
        see-IRR-DR
        ‘I don’t see anything.’ ~ ‘I’ll see X (sometime).’Morphologically, the irrealis marker behaves slightly differently on verbs with monovalent
and middle roots (cf. 8.3.2 and 8.3.3, respectively). This may have to do with their inherent
valency, but it can also be a purely morphological phenomenon. When the irrealis marker is
attached to verbs with monovalent or middle roots, the voice affix, which is normally attached
to the root, is lost. This is to say, monovalent verbs lose the reflexive/reciprocal marker -che ,
which indicates agentivity of the participant (cf. 8.1.4, 8.3.2), and verbs with middle roots
lose the middle reduplication (cf. 8.3.3). Since only a single iambic element remains, the
irrealis marker is attached as a suffix and then reduplicated (cf. 3.6.2). In (57) and (71) above,
examples of verbs with middle roots were given, which would have the form kay~kay ‘to eat’
(cf. (57)) and de<ja:~>jal ‘to cook’ (cf. (71)) if not marked as irrealis. The following
examples are of irrealis-marked verbs with a monovalent root, which take the
reflexive/reciprocal suffix -che when not marked as irrealis. The verb in jo<ya:~>y-a’ in
(73) would appear as joy-che ‘go’ if not marked as irrealis; the verb de<ka:~>-ka’ in (74)
would appear as de:-che ‘lie’. An example involving the verb en-che ‘to stand’ was seen in
(64) above.(73)    i’ne   jo<ya:~>y-a’       n-as        leve-na-wa=‘ne

voice marker -na, which, on these roots, indicates that the undergoer is a location, the voice
marker is retained. This is the same type of marking as on verbs containing a bivalent root and                                                                                              441

10.4.       -na:na’ ‘pseudo’
The suffix -na:na’ can occur on nouns as well as on verbs. It is not very productive and often
lexicalized together with the root.243
  On nouns, the suffixation of -na:na’ indicates that the denoted entity is reminiscent of the
entity denoted by the nominal base, but not identical with it. Therefore, I adopt the gloss
‘pseudo’ from Judy & Judy (1967). The examples in (78) illustrate this meaning:(78)     pa:ko-na:na’   ‘fox’ (dog-PSEU)
         kodosi-na:na’  ‘artificial duck (e.g. of plastic)’ (duck-PSEU)
         sapa’mo-na:na’ ‘small calabash’ (SP. tutumillo) (calabash-PSEU)Likewise, on verbs, the suffix -na:na’ indicates that the action denoted by the verb root is
only pretended. The suffix is attached to monovalent roots or bases only, and the resulting
verb is monovalent.(79)     dejal-na:na’ is            dichi:ye

         ‘to be running without being able to’, ‘to run slowly’                     {JM 18, 083b}243
   This suffix is apparently the result of CV-reduplication of the segment /nak/. However, the only examples that
may show an unreduplicated morpheme -na’ are tomi:-na’ ‘wet season’ (water-?) and ita:-na’ ‘white person’
(?-?).","[459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465]"

the position of the actor. The particle da’, which occurs inside the NP that refers to the

        ‘And I (standing) looked at (it), I saw the (lying) jaguar.’ {EA, Jaguar 135}The particles ena’ and daya’ or da’ are used according to the same criteria as the positional
demonstratives of Set 1 and Set 2 (cf. 4.9.2.1). That is, the particle ena’ occurs under the same
conditions as the demonstratives of Set 1 (e.g kore’ ‘DM.std.n’), and the particle da’ or daya’
occurs when the referent is sitting or lying, which corresponds to the demonstratives of Set 2
(e.g. kode: ‘DM.nst.n’). Consequently, in a clause that contains a demonstrative, the durative
particle corresponds to the respective demonstrative:(125)    kine’e=s           ena’         tolkosya    di’ ena’

Set 4 ‘possessed’ (cf. 4.9.2.2, 4.9.2.3), the choice of the durative particle depends on the
inherent position or motion of the referent. In (128) and (129), the particle da’ is used, since
the referents of the demonstratives are in a non-standing position:

12.3.          Modal and epistemic particles
In this section I describe particles that indicate the speaker’s attitude towards the contents of
the proposition. Many of them are employed to attain a particular effect with the addressee.
The following particles will be illustrated in this section:(130)        rey               ‘again’
             loy               ‘intentional’
             joy(ka)           ‘speculative’
             choy              ‘certainly’
             di’               ‘hypothetical’
             dis               ‘optative’
             disoy             ‘counterfactual’
             didi’             ‘frustrative’
             kwaj              ‘emphatic’
             toje              ‘very’
             ja’               ‘just’
              an               ‘evidential’12.3.1. rey ‘again, obviously’
I consider the particle rey in its modal function as identical to the aspectual particle rey
‘again’ described in 12.2.13 above, even though the two may be merely historically related.
For the time being, I gloss this word as ‘again’ everywhere. The only formal difference
between the aspectual and the modal particle is that the long form reyka can only occur in the
aspectual function.
  As may have become apparent from previous examples in this book, the particle rey is
extremely frequent. Its meaning is often not reflected in the English translation, because it is
hard to characterize.269 It can perhaps be said that it is used when the speaker wants to present
the contents of the proposition as common knowledge, which may or may not be shared by
the addressee. The following examples may serve as an illustration.","[546, 547, 548]"

that it has a nominal origin, too.
  While it is sometimes difficult to isolate the meaning of the root in these verbs, it is clearly
the case that predicates with -baycho in affirmative contexts denote some kind of mental state
or psychological property. This can be seen in (107) and (108) above, as well as in (110)–
(112) below:(110)   dom-baycho     us        dotor

are also worth mentioning. These are pabaycho ‘think’ (cf. (113)) and to’baycho ‘remember’

Since all these words involve, to some degree, a mental activity or state, the suffix -baycho in
these cases can be considered identical to -baycho in negative contexts, where it also indicates
a (more specific) state of mind.
  Note, however, that there is one formal difference between predicates containing -baycho in
affirmative and in negative clauses. In affirmative use, the suffix -baycho creates a predicate
whose argument is absolutive, as expected of monovalent predicates. This could be seen, for
example, in (108) and (114), where the first person singular is encoded by the bound pronoun
of Set 2, in.247 In contrast, in negative contexts, the derived predicate has an internally
cliticized argument (cf. (101)–(106)). No explanation for this contrast in person encoding can
be given at this point.","[469, 470, 471, 472]"
"
4.8.2.2. Past vs. non-past marking of temporal and action nominals
The clearest cases of non-time-stable “referents” are times and events. Since they have
usually ceased to exist in a past-tense context, they are always referred to by the past-tense
article in past-tense discourse. Time categories are usually referred to by noun phrases in
Movima, and in negative or subordinate clauses, events are encoded by noun phrases as well
(cf. 7.12). The high frequency of these NPs makes the article, primarily an indicator of ceased
or ongoing existence of the referent, the main tense marker in Movima.
  Examples of past marking of action nominals could be seen in (113)–(115) above. Example
(129) shows that the internal temporal structure of an event does not influence the choice of
the article. Here, the context indicates that the event of ‘holding’ is progressive; still, it is
combined with the past-tense article, since the entire event takes place in the past.(129)   che n-os            jayna     e~’ew-wa=as             os           pa:ko,

  It might seem an alternative possibility to analyse -e ‘APPL’ as a valency-increasing
marker by itself. This is because, as was illustrated by (194), the applicative marker always
cooccurs with the bivalent voice marker, so that it is difficult to tell whether it is the voice
marker or the applicative marker which is responsible for the valency increase. However,
when a different bivalent voice marker is attached, such as the inverse marker (cf. (193)) or
the direct imperative marker (cf. (192)c), it is attached in addition to the applicative marker,
and not instead of the direct voice marker. This shows that the direct bivalent voice marker is
equivalent to the other voice markers in this construction, and that there is no reason to
assume that -e itself increases the semantic valency of the verb. It only increases the inherent
valency of the verb by ascribing a different status to the incorporated element.235
9.8.2. -e on verblike adjectives
The suffix -e is productive on verblike adjectives, which have an obligatory bound element
(cf. 3.10.4 and 9.2.9). Here, it also has an applicative function, because it allows a new
participant to be expressed as the absolutive argument:(202)       son-lolos-e           us         pa’a

referential element coreferential with the incorporated element:(205)       asko       son-lo:los
            PRO.n.a other-village

-e indicates that the predication is about the contents of the container:235
      Recall the definition of semantic and inherent valency in the introduction to Chapter 8.","[436, 437]"
"Apart from a bound pronoun, a possessor can additionally be encoded by a free pronoun or an
NP. The most productive way to encode the possessor by a free form is the addition of a
relative clause containing an oblique-marked pronoun, as in (2).(2)       oso’     os         kawayo=y’ i       di’ n-iy’ i
          DM.n.p ART.n.p horse=1pl              REL obl-PRO.1pl
          ‘We had a horse of our own.’ [lit.: “There was our horse, which was of us.”]
          {EA, Cbba 059}The free pronoun or NP can also occur directly after the possessed noun. This is similar to a
free pronoun encoding an argument of a clause, to be described in 7.3. The pronoun or NP can
either be unmarked, or it can be marked as oblique. It is not clear what the conditions are for
alternative marking, but the choice is not arbitrary. First of all, there are nouns on which the
possessor can only be expressed by the oblique pronoun, marked by the prefix n- (cf. 4.6), as
in (3)a. The use of an unmarked pronoun is ungrammatical, as shown by (3)b.(3)       a. as        roya=n         n-ulkwan
             ART.n house=2            obl-PRO.2sg

228
With other nouns, it is only possible to express the possessor by the unmarked pronoun, as in
(4)a, but not by an oblique pronoun. The oblique pronoun can only occur in the relative
clause, as in (4)b:(4)      a. is        e: -a=n   ulkwan
            ART.pl BR.name-LV=2 PRO.2sg
            ‘the name of yours’         b. is       e: -a=n                        di’ n-ulkwan
            ART.pl BR.name-LV=2                     REL obl-PRO.2sg

properties of the noun (cf. 6.2): a non-relational noun such as ro:ya ‘house’ in (3) can only be
combined with an oblique-marked possessive pronoun, whereas a relational noun such as e
‘BR.name’ is combined with an unmarked pronoun.115
  However, the data are contradictory. For instance, the noun iwaniwansi ‘my way of
speaking’, a relational noun, is often found with the oblique pronoun, but cannot be combined
with the unmarked pronoun (cf. (5)).116 In contrast, some non-relational nouns, such as ju:ve
‘dugout’, can be combined neither with the unmarked nor, as would be expected, with the
oblique pronoun (cf. (6)). And finally, there are nouns which, despite being non-relational,
can be combined with the unmarked pronoun (cf. (7)).(5)      a. as      iwani-wansi=n               n-i:de              mowi:maj

    This would be a parallel between relational nouns and bivalent verbs (cf. 7.3).
116
    All deverbal instrument nouns are relational, as will be shown in 11.1.6.
117
    As will be shown in 6.2, the encoding of the first person is not obligatory with relational nouns. In (5),
therefore, the marker of the first person is omitted, only leaving the second-person marker =n to encode the first
person inclusive on the noun (cf. 4.1.2).","[251, 252]"
"90
with an open first syllable, this syllable is long due to prosodic factors (cf. 2.8.2). This
prosodic lengthening can be taken into account for reduplication or not. The word ro:ya
‘house’, for example, can be marked for predicative possession in two ways:(96)    a. ro:~ro:ya        ~       b. roya~ro:ya
           POSS~house                  POSS~house
           ‘to own a house’In contrast, words whose first syllable is always long, e.g. disyllabic loans (cf. 2.9.2), do not
permit this variation, since the first syllable is inherently heavy. This is the case with the word
wa:ka ‘cow’ (cf. (95)b above), which cannot undergo disyllabic reduplication:(97)    * waka~wa:ka
          POSS~cow
          (‘to own cows’)Prefixing reduplication marking a possessive predicate can cooccur with infixing
reduplication. In (98), an example is given of a possessive predicate formed of a noun marked
for inalienable possession (cf. 3.7.5). It is structured as follows. In (98)a, the noun charayelo
‘honey’ is marked by infixing reduplication for inalienable possession, as in (92) and (93)a
above, with the possessor expressed by an internally cliticized bound pronoun. In (98)b, the
same noun is marked as a possessive predicate by prefixing foot reduplication; its argument is
expressed by the externally cliticized bound pronoun (cf. 3.9.2, 7.9.1). In (98)c, finally, the
two reduplicative processes occur on the same base: the inalienably possessed noun in (98)a is
marked by prefixing foot reduplication, as in (98)b, as a possessive predicate in a relative
clause.(98)    a. charaye<lo~>lo=is
           syrup-<INAL~>BR.liquid=pl.a
           ‘their honey (of the bees)’        b. chara~charaye:-lo--is
           POSS~syrup-BR.liquid--pl.a
           ‘They have honey.’ [lit.: “They are honey-owners.”]        c. is        chuydi di’ chara~charaye-<lo:~>lo

           ‘bees which have (their) honey’ [lit.: “which are honey-owners”] {JM 17, 278}Another case in which both types of reduplication cooccur is when a possessive predicate
occurs in a subordinate or negative clause (cf. (99)a and b, respectively). Here, the noun with
the foot reduplication undergoes additional infixing reduplication (cf. 3.7.4):
                                                                                                91

possessive predicate formed by the irrealis marker -a’ on nouns (cf. 3.6.2):(100)   kas    chara<ka’>ye-lo=i
        NEG syrup<IRR>-BR.liquid=pl

determined by the first iambic foot of the base, as is the position of the irrealis marker. It is
striking that these morphological processes, which are related in meaning but formally quite
distinct, are influenced by the same prosodic feature of the base.","[113, 114, 115]"

1.11. Presentation of the data
The presentation of the Movima data as well as the English translation given deserve some
explanation.
  When a bivalent predicate in Movima is not combined with a cliticized referential element,
this automatically implies that the first argument is the first person singular. All bivalent
verbs, furthermore, have an implicit second argument, even though it is not obligatorily
overtly realized. Therefore, a simple bivalent verb without person marking is translated into
English as a full clause with a first person singular subject; the implied second argument is
always represented as “X”:(1)     sal-na    ‘I look for X.’Temporal categories are often not overtly indicated in Movima, but inferred from the context.
Hence, a clause unmarked for tense can imply any temporal category (past, present, future),
and example (1) can mean ‘I (have) looked for X,’ ‘I will look for X,’ etc. This is a problem
for the English translation, which I have solved as follows: examples where no context exists
(in particular, elicitation examples) are translated into the English simple present, even when
this does not sound like good English. Examples where a temporal context exists, even when
this cannot be seen in the example itself, are translated in a way which fits into this context
(e.g., ‘I looked for X’ in (1)). In many examples, the translation fits with the Movima data,
since tense is often reflected in the article.
  An area where Movima displays finer differentiations than English is spatial deixis: articles,
pronouns and demonstratives always indicate whether a referent is present, absent, in
existence or out of existence. Unless relevant for the discussion, I do not reflect these
categories in the English translation:(2)     a. i’nes kwe:ya            b. kinos     kwe:ya     c.        isnos     kwe:ya
           ART.f woman                ART.f.a woman                  ART.f.p woman
           ‘the/a woman (present)’    ‘the/a woman (absent)’         ‘the/a woman (deceased)’
           ‘the/a woman’               ‘the/a woman’                 ‘the/a woman’Occasionally, I use the indices i and j when it is necessary to indicate whether two are
coreferential or not:(3)     di’ joy-sicha’kwa=‘ne joy-che --i’ne, jankwa=sne
        HYP go-DES=f                  go-R/R--f        say=f.a
        ‘If she i wants to go, she i goes, shej said.’In the English translations, I use round brackets (as in (2)a and b) for relevant information
implicit in the Movima example. Contextual information, which cannot be inferred from the
example, is given in square brackets:(4)     sal-na      ‘I look for [her].’Many particles indicating tense, aspect, and mood (henceforth TAM) and discourse particles                                                                                             13
are hard to translate. For example, it is not clear how the particle rey in (5), which occurs in
almost every sentence, should be translated:(5)      bo        rey     ban-cho           os       ben‘i
         REAS      again bare-BR.inside ART.n.p grassland
         ‘Because the savannah was flat (you know/of course?).’             {EA, Cbba 164}Therefore, I often do not translate these particles.
  Square brackets with dots […] in the Movima example mean that a part of the text has been
omitted.
  It was necessary to employ special symbols representing different morphological processes.
Most are taken from the Leipzig Glossing Rules of 2003, like those given in (6).13 Others,
shown in (7), are specifically introduced for the purpose of the present description.(6)      ~       reduplication
         <>      infixation(7)      =       (internal) cliticization
         --      external cliticizationAs suggested by the Leipzig Glossing Rules, I sometimes use a colon ( : ) in the glosses when
it is not practical to segment the Movima word. For example, when a morphologically
complex noun is incorporated into a verb, this process can be represented more adequately
when the different morphemes of the noun are not set apart. In (8), an example is given of a
complex noun (cf. (8)a) that is incorporated into a verb (cf. (8)b). From the glosses in (8)b, it
can be seen that the noun consists of several morphemes. In (8)c, the morphemes are
separated; here, it is not directly clear from the representation whether the suffix - e modifies
the verb or, as is actually the case, belongs to the noun.(8)      a. kwa-n- e                          b. ban-kwan e         c. ban-kwa-n- e

            ‘upper side, opening’                ‘to be put on top’    ‘to be put on top’The source of the examples is usually indicated. Between braces, the speaker code is given
(cf. Table 1), followed by either a word, an abbreviation, or a number. In text examples, the
speaker code is followed by words or by an abbreviation indicating the text, as shown (9)a.
Elicitation examples are marked by a number following the speaker code, as in (9)b.14
Examples from elicitation on demonstratives are marked by “DEM”, as in (9)c.","[35, 36, 37]"

While all predicate nominals can be reduplicated in order to function as the predicate of a
negative or subordinate clause, the suffix - e has a more limited distribution. First of all, the
form with - e occurs more often in negative than in subordinate clauses. The following
example illustrates this. In (16)a, the adjective tochi’ ‘small’ occurs in a negative clause with
the suffix - e. In (16)b, it is shown that in a subordinate clause, this suffix cannot be used.
Rather, the reduplicated form has to be used, as shown by (16)c (cf. also (8) above).(16)    a. kas     tochi'- e

           ‘When I was small, that (was where) I grew up.’                          {JM 16, 253b}Furthermore, nominalization through - e is very common on adjectives, while more
prototypical nouns are only rarely found with this suffix (cf. 3.10.4.3). The only text example
of a noun with the suffix - e in a negative clause is given in (17):(17)    jayna kas        don-’i- e=os       chi:~chi
        DSC NEG blood-D-NMZ.N=n.p MD~go_out
        ‘It wasn’t blood anymore what came out.’                                   {EA, Cbba 159}The reason why in (17), the predicate nominal don’i ‘blood’ is marked by - e and not by
reduplication, may be that when reduplicated, the word would be homophonous with the
inalienably possessed form. Recall from 3.7.5 and 6.4.1 that like action nominalization,
inalienable possession is marked by infixing reduplication. This is illustrated in (18) for the
same word as in (17) above. The sentence in (18) is the one which follows (17) in the
narration.(18)    ba:-ra          jayna     os         don-<‘i:~>‘i        jayna

        ‘I had lost all my blood.’ [lit: “My blood was finished.”] {EA, Cbba 160}In this particular context, it is possible that the suffix - e is used in (17) in order to distinguish
the negated predicate nominal from the inalienably possessed noun in (18). However, it can
still be concluded that adjectives are more often combined with the suffix - e than nouns,
especially in negative clauses, so that the tendency to use - e on adjectives can be seen as a
distinction between the two word classes.
   Before concluding the present section, I will briefly discuss verbs that contain the ending
-wa, but where this element does not have a nominalizing function. Examples include                                                                                                 471

        DSC       feel_pain--f.a     obl-ART.n.p leg=f.a

        ‘When there are many people when theyi go out [onto the stage], theyi are ashamed.’
        {EA, Tolkosya I 028}When these verbs are nominalized, the nominalizing suffix -wa is attached. This shows that
-wa in (19) and (20) above is not the nominalizing suffix, but part of the verbal base.(21)    n-as       tivijniwa-wa=i
        obl-ART.n feel_pain-NMZ=pl
        ‘when they have pain’                                   {AH, EA&AH 023}(22)    kas     chajaniwa:-wa         n-in a       n-as     je’e

        ‘I am not ashamed of myself, of how I am.’         {HR, TX 088}While the verb chajaniwa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)) always occurs with the ending -wa, there is
also a verb tivijni ‘hurt’, derived from the noun ti:vij ‘pain’, which does not contain the
ending -wa. Here, a difference in meaning can be observed: the argument of the verb tivijni
‘hurt’ expresses the body part which hurts, whereas the argument of the verb tivijni:wa ‘feel
pain’ expresses the person or animal that feels pain. Compare (24) below, which contains the
nominalized form of the verb tivijni ‘hurt’, with (19) above, which contains the verb tivijni:wa
‘feel pain’. Apart from the difference in meaning, ‘hurt’ versus ‘feel pain’, the form in (24) is
a relational noun, while the one in (19) above is a monovalent verb.(23)    tivij-ni    as    bari=‘ne

        ‘That was when her toe hurt.’                          {EA, Lagartija 021}  Thus, there is a suffix -wa, homophonous with the nominalizer, which has an applicative
function, raising a new participant to argument function. However, this suffix does not seem
to be productive, since only these two examples were found.","[493, 494, 495]"

the concept or entity denoted by the content word of the noun phrase. The content word can
be a noun or a verb (cf. 7.10). Example (20) shows a noun phrase (underlined) containing a

In (22), the direct bivalent voice marker -na on the verb indicates that the entity referred to by
the article is the undergoer of a two-participant event. A more detailed account of this
phenomenon is found in 7.10 and 8.2.
  The content word in a noun phrase can be modified by a relative clause (cf. 7.11):                                                                                              139

syntactic proclitics to the predicate or noun they modify (cf. 4.1), the article is a syntactic
proclitic to the content word with which it forms a noun phrase. Between the article and this
word, only particles can occur (cf. Ch. 12), as illustrated by (24) and (25):(24)    is       nu:<na~>n-a=is              chon wa:ka di’ tikoy-na=us

        ‘And where will the ranch be then?’                    {GB, Ganado 049}Some forms of the article are similar, or even identical, to the absential bound pronouns (cf.
Table 9 above). However, there is an important phonological difference: the final /s/ of the
article is often realized as [h] (cf. 2.6):(26)    as pa:ko       [as pa:k ] ~ [ah 'pa:k ]        ‘the/a dog’    (ART.n dog)On bound pronouns, in contrast, this aspiration never occurs. Compare the pronunciation of
the article as in (27)a with that of the homophonous bound pronoun as in (27)b:(27)    a.    am-na=as         pa:ko        b.     am-na=as

             ‘The/a dog bites X.’                 ‘It bites X.’The choice of the two variants of the article is speaker-dependent: some speakers consistently
use the aspirated variant, others use most of the time the variant with the final [s], and many
use both variants interchangeably. With speakers who always use the aspirated variant, the
[s]-final variant appears when the following word begins with a sibilant (/t / or /s/):(28)    is china a [ is t i'na a]                ‘(the) manioc’      (ART.pl manioc)It seems that older speakers mainly use the [s]-final forms. The [s]-final forms as given in
Table 11 above are the ones used by Judy & Judy (1967) and were also chosen by the
speakers as the standard spelling. They can be seen as underlying, firstly because a final /h/ is140
never realized as [s], and secondly because the aspiration seems to be a common phenomenon
in the local variety of Spanish as well. However, it is important to keep in mind that the
possibility of aspiration is a phonological criterion for distinguishing articles from bound
pronouns.
  I will now turn to the internal morphological structure of the article. All article forms can be
analysed as composed of a syllabic element which specifies semantic and pragmatic features
of the referent, and the final element s, which has the function of introducing a noun phrase.
This analysis is supported by the fact that both elements can occur separately and in
combination with other morphemes. The final element s can be cliticized to a proximate or
positional demonstrative (cf. 4.3 and 4.9.1 below). In this way, the demonstrative acquires a
determiner function. Example (29) illustrates the determining function of a speaker-oriented
proximate demonstrative:(29)      ayru=s             as-wa:nas neyru, kas yey-a-waj-wa
          DM.spk.n=DET sit-ABSTR here         NEG want-DR-BE.place-NMZ
          ‘This house here, I don’t like it.’                       {EA, Mi casa 003}Examples (30)–(31) show positional demonstratives as determining referential elements:(30)      dol-ra      kode:=s          ro:ya n-is           mo’incho:-bun

          ‘... because that woman doesn’t like me at all.’            {EA, Asilo 090}Example (32) shows that the demonstrative is an element of the noun phrase, since it encodes
the possessor and is attached to the possessed noun by internal cliticization (cf. 3.9.1):(32)      u’ko       ulcha -a=kine’e=s            kwe:ya63
          PRO.m in_law-LV=DM.f.std=DET woman
          ‘He is the son-in-law of that (standing) woman.’ {EA, Neighbours 011}The absential and the past demonstratives (cf. 4.9.3) do not occur as determiners. They can
only function as pronouns or as predicates (cf. 7.3.3 and 7.9.4).
  Thus, the final =s of the article occurs on other referential elements, converting them into
determiners. The first element of the article, in turn, can be combined with the first-person
marker , rather than with =s, in possessive noun phrases (cf. 4.1):(33)      a=     pa:ko
          n=1    dog
          ‘my dog’63
   In demonstratives that end in a glottal stop, the clitic is attached to the release vowel that follows the glottal
stop; cf. 2.3.2, 3.9.3.","[162, 163, 164]"

  Since not only verbs, but also nouns can function as the predicate of an affirmative main
clause (cf. 7.9), action nominalization applies to nouns as well. However, when turned into an
action noun, a predicate nominal undergoes a different morphological process than a verbal
predicate. It undergoes infixing reduplication, or it receives a suffix - e. I will first describe
nominalization by reduplication. In (7) and (8), adverbial clauses with predicate nominals are
shown:254(7)      n-asko       rey    tolkos<ya~>ya=sne
         obl-PRO.n.a again girl<NMZ.N~>=f.a

         ‘I knew [her] when she was small, like this.’           {EG, Dial. 065}Example (9) shows a predicate nominal in a negative clause:(9)      jayna       kas    mo:to-to<da~>da=a
         DSC         NEG motorbike-BR.piece<NMZ.N~>=n
         ‘It’s not a wrecked motorbike anymore.’ [i.e., it has been repaired] {EA, Moto 006}When a possessive predicate, formed by prefixing foot reduplication of a noun (cf. 3.7.6,
7.9.5) occurs in a subordinate or negative clause, it undergoes infixing reduplication as well.
The resulting word then contains two reduplicated elements, as shown in (10) and (11). The
fact that these predicates are reduplicated, like nouns, and do not nominalized through the
suffix -wa, like verbs, is a sign that morphologically, possessive predicates are nouns.","[491, 492]"

5.3.5. Homophony
There is quite a number of homophonous bound elements. Homophony occurs within one
morphological class of elements, such as the three morphemes -mo in the list in (92), which
are truncated forms of nouns ending in the same syllable. When all types of bound elements
are taken together, however, the amount of homophony is striking. The following lists
summarize some of these cases and provide, where possible, the morphologically related
                                                                                             223

                2. fan                 (bo:ve ‘fan’)The homophony of different bound elements is normally not a problem, since the context
disambiguates between the different possible interpretations of one form. The following
elicitation example illustrates how speakers deal with the ambiguity. Here, the meaning of the
element di was tested. The clause in (148)a was accepted by the speaker, since it contains a
disambiguating full noun (ro:ya ‘house’). Even though grammatically correct, the clause in
(148)b was rejected, however. According to the speaker, one would not know whether the
proposition was about “a house, a rope, or something else”.(148)   a. ona-di:-na   kos        ro:ya di’ tavoj-di

More research is needed on some nearly-homophonous bound elements. Some bound
elements consisting of a CV-sequence have a semantically similar counterpart which only
differs in that it contains an additional syllable-final lateral fricative, / /. Consider the pairs in
(149); the simple forms are listed under a, the corresponding forms with the ending - under b:(149)    a. ba        ‘BR.round’        b. ba        ‘BR.cover’
            cho       ‘BR.inside’          cho       ‘BE.between’
            lo        ‘BR.liquid’          lo        ‘BR.water as Ground (non-manipulable)’
            mo        ‘TRC.bush’           mo        ‘TRC.bush’The elements of each pair are not only phonologically, but also semantically related. The
elements under b denote an entity on which something can be located, and this entity is
similar to the entity characterized by the corresponding element under a. The following
examples illustrates this for -cho (cf. (150)a) and -cho (cf. (150)b):(150)    a. chut-a-cho -a=as                  os          pa:ko     n-os         chowit-a=as

9.8). On verbs with a bound nominal element, this marker indicates that the entity denoted by
the bound element is involved in the event as a ground or as an instrument (cf. 9.2.4, 9.2.5):(151)    joro-poy-e                as       mi:chi n-as       pa:ko

         ‘The cat is sleeping on (top of) the dog.’                           {JM 3, 268}There is some evidence that the bound nominal element with - is identical in function to the
applicative marker. In (152), the short form can be replaced by the long form of the marker
(which is -ne after a vowel):(152)     a. wes-mo: -e                       n-as                  chammo

problem with this analysis is that the lateral fricative also occurs on the roots of full nouns
with -kwa (cf. 5.3.2.3):                                                                                                 225

else (juice, nut) or which serves as a kind of container for something (nest, shell, hole). This
common property may be a function of the element - , while the CV element indicates the
type of container. However, more research is needed on the internal structure of bound
elements before this idea can be confirmed.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"

This shows that elevation is generally determined with respect to the ground, not with respect
to the moveable object on which the referent may be located.
  When a human referent is concerned, this is different. Here, usually the internal orientation
of the referent is encoded rather than its location with respect to the ground. This means that a
person sitting or standing on a higher level is usually referred to by a Set 1 or Set 2
demonstrative. Examples (199) and (200), respectively, illustrate this.(199)   kine’      en-che       i’nes dichi:ye n-as     de:-na
        DM.std.f stand-R/R ART.f child         obl- ART lie-DR

        ‘She is lying down [on the bed] because she doesn’t feel very well.’ {EA, DEM 056}For human referents, a demonstrative of Set 1 or Set 2 can also be used when the referent is
standing on an elevated location which is not a typical ground, as in (201):(201)   kilne’            en-che      n-as         tolej-a=as ko’o

        ‘The girl is standing on a branch of the tree.’            {EA, DEM 115a}In contrast, the following examples show that when a non-human referent is concerned, a
similar situation as the one described in (200) requires encoding by the Set 3 demonstrative,
as in (202). The use of the Set 2 demonstrative would be appropriate for a different situation,
like the one described in (203), in which direct contact with the ground is provided.(202)   kowa         de:-che as        pa:ko n-as          de:-na

        ‘The dog is lying on my bed.’ [when my bed is on the floor]           {EA, DEM 043}A Set 3 demonstrative can be used, however, for human referents, too. In (204)a, it indicates
that the person does not have his feet on the ground, as opposed to the situation described in
(204)b:(204)   a. kuwa         de:-che n-as         se:le

             ‘He is lying in the hammock.’ [with feet on the ground]                       {GC, DEM 326}Judging from these data, the distinction between the demonstratives of Set 1/2 and 3 is less
strict for human referents than for non-human referents, the demonstratives of Set 1 and 2
being more broadly applicable for human referents. An explanation for this can be that for a
human referent, the position (standing vs. not-standing) is conceived as more salient or more
important than the opposition of their being located on the ground vs. on a higher level.89
  It has to be pointed out, however, that there is speaker variation with respect to the choice
between a demonstrative of Set 1/2 and one of Set 3. This is due to the fact that the forms of
Set 1/2 differentiate the inherent position of the referent, while those of Set 3 do not. Some
speakers generally prefer to indicate the location of the referent with respect to the ground
instead of indicating its inherent position. When referring to a person located on a higher
level, these speakers sometimes spontaneously use the Set 3 demonstrative:(205)     kiniwa=s          dichi:ye n-as     de:-na=n
          DM.el.f=DET child           obl-ART lie-DR=2
          ‘The girl is lying on your bed.’                                              {EA, DEM 113}Other speakers choose the demonstrative according to the inherent position of the referent.
These speakers even use a demonstrative of Set 1 or Set 2 spontaneously for an inanimate
entity on a higher level, as is illustrated by the following examples:(206)     kode:         ban -sasa:-ne bas-to
          DM.nst.n put-TRC.table-APPL ?-BE.side
          ‘It is lying on the table.’                                                   {ER, DEM 399}(207)     kore’        en-che       as      bote:liya n-as       se:le
          DM.std.n stand-R/R ART.n bottle             obl- ART.n hammock
          ‘The bottle is standing in the hammock.’                     {PC, DEM 063}Apart from the speaker variation with respect to the choice of the demonstrative, the neat
categorization system of the positional demonstratives seems to be getting lost. Speakers who
are not very fluent anymore avoid these forms. When referring to entities in sight, but out of
reach, the absential demonstrative (cf. 4.9.3 below) and the demonstrative adverb nakal (cf.
4.6 above) are combined:89
   Moreover, it seems that with human referents, up to a certain degree the speaker can choose between Set 1/2
and Set 3 demonstratives depending on what s/he wants to emphasize. So for example, one consultant pointed
out to me that a baby lying on a table would usually be referred to by kode: (Set 2); according to her, however, it
is also possible to use kowa (Set 3) instead to emphasize that the baby is lying in an unusual place. This may also
account for the spontaneous use of the Set 3 demonstrative in (205), since the person is lying not on her own
bed, but on somebody else’s.","[206, 207, 208]"

there was a method to elongate the heads of little babies. Nowadays, the only material
attributes that can be seen as typically Movima are the adorned mats of reed woven by the
women, and chivé (in Movima: mo’incho), a powder of roasted fermented manioc, which is
usually mixed with water to drink. It is probably due to the lack of “exotic” features that the
Movima culture has been very much neglected by anthropologists.
  Precolonial Movima mythology seems to have disappeared a long time ago. D’Orbigny
(1839) found there were memories of an evil spirit called Canibaba Kilmo (cf. Montaño
Aragón 1987: 247, Métraux 1942: 82).4 Native speakers say that there are still old people who
may know some folk tales. On several occasions I accompanied speakers to visit these old
people, but they always said that they had forgotten the stories. In the Movima narrative
tradition, their history starts with the arrival of the first cattle. The Movimas were already
Catholics then, represented by the cacique of the cabildo indigenal, which still exists today.
  In the 19th century, white farmers5 came into the Beni Department to raise cattle, using the
Indians as workers (cf. Crevels 2002: 15). During the so-called “rubber boom”, Indians from
all of Amazonia were transported to the rubber regions and used as slaves. The survivors
returned to their original villages and continued working for white farmers (Riester 1976: 51).
  Interestingly, Nordenskiöld (1922: 76) reports that during his travels he met quite a few
wealthy Movima Indians who owned cattle, sewing machines, guns and rifles, clothing etc.
This is supported by different stories told to me about their parents or grandparents who had
been wealthy land owners who traded with white merchants. Usually, cattle was exchanged
for artifacts, like jewellery, weapons, or sewing machines. Some say that this is what finally
ruined the Indians, who sold off their cattle in order to pay the high prices for the goods. For
example, the price for a pair of golden earrings was one adult cow, and a foot-driven sewing
machine cost a pair of tame ox. The real impoverishment of the Movimas, however, is
probably primarily due to the land reform that took place in 1953 (cf. Crevels 2002: 19, Díez
Astete & Murillo 1998: 156).
  In the 1980s, Santa Ana del Yacuma played a central role in the Bolivian drug trade. Coca
paste from the Chapare region was processed in laboratories around Santa Ana and sold to
Columbian traders. The most famous drugs barons of Bolivia lived in Santa Ana, which
prospered at that time. In 1991, an invasion by the United States’ Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) ended this situation. Apparently, the Indians did not profit from the
money the drug traffic brought; on the contrary. Those years are reported to have been
dominated by violence, of which Indian employees in the country were often the victims.
  Today, apart from self-sustaining horticulture and some hunting, most people work for the
white upper class, as cowboys or as domestic employees. This is not an ideal situation,
exacerbated by the fact that on the ranches only the men, who work with the cattle, earn
money, while their wives, who do the domestic work, earn nothing. The salary is so low that
the workers are often forced to borrow money from their employers, so that they are often
working to pay off increasing debts. An alternative system exists in which workers are not
paid, but receive half of the cattle raised during five years. The workers, however, usually do
not have land on which they could keep this cattle, so they generally end up selling it back to
the land owner and continue working as employees.","[25, 26]"
