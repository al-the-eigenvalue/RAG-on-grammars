2.3.4.3.3 Polar Question Particle á
Yes-no questions are marked with a clause-final interrogative particle, á (104).104.     À      ri     le            dì                á?

       Elicitation was done either in the village of Tin or in the town of Orodara, both of which
are Siamou speaking areas, about 15 kilometres apart. Sessions were recorded in .wav files with
a Marantz PMD660 solid state recorder using two of three microphones (one for the linguist and
one for the consultant): an omni-directional mic, a hand-held cardioid mic, and a lapel mic. The
omni-directional mic, although lovely in theory, was much better at recording cicadas, roosters,
donkeys, and mopeds than Siamou utterances so it was phased out. I used the hand-held mic
(with a mic stand) while Solo used the lapel mic. The recordings were later transferred to a
Macbook laptop. All Siamou utterances, along with any related information, were entered into a
database using Toolbox (an SIL software program).
       When I returned to Canada, I was able to continue with my research by conducting
elicitation through email questionnaires. This was a beneficial supplement to in-person elicitation
because some elements of the grammar which my ears had missed became more apparent. Email
elicitation requires different techniques than in-person elicitation. Since there is often a time lag
between the time questions are asked and the time responses are received, it is extra important to
make the questions as clear as possible. Depending on availability of internet, a
misunderstanding could take weeks to clear up. Some techniques that I learned through trial and
error were the following:14.    a.      Do not make questionnaires too long. Three pages of well-spaced questions was a
               good length in my situation.
       b.      Put lots of empty space between questions so that it is clear when you are
               transitioning from one to the next.
       c.      Make the utterances that you are asking about stand out visually using boldface
               text or something similar.
       d.      Make it very clear where answers are expected. One way to do this is to draw a
               blank line after every question to which you would like a response.
       e.      It is sometimes necessary to ask the same kinds of questions more than once in
               different ways, especially if the answers are not clear at first. Even slightly
               rephrasing a question can affect the answers you get.
       f.      It is often useful to elicit data in stages. The first round of questions might involve
               asking for translations of utterances in the language of communication (French, in
               this case). It might also involve constructing Siamou utterances and determining if
               they are grammatical. Once you have a set of well-formed Siamou utterances, you
               can construct contexts and find out if the utterances are felicitous in those
               contexts, or even ask the consultant to supply contexts. Care must be taken with
               this because grammatical utterances may be rejected as ill-formed initially if no
               context is provided, but deemed acceptable with an appropriate context.","[28, 29]"
"Both of these sentences require the situation to be one in which your mom answered the phone,
but (8b) also requires both the speaker and the addressee to already believe that someone
answered the phone. This means that the question Did someone answer the phone? in (9) can be
answered by (9a), but not by (9b), even though both of them are true. Therefore these sentences
have similar truth conditions, but different felicity conditions (Matthewson 2004).",[198]
"9.     Did someone answer the phone?       a.      Yes, your mom answered the phone.
       b.      # Yes, it was your mom who answered the phone.",[198]
"        The example in (92) also shows that ín implicates (but does not entail) that the situation
no longer holds. If (92a) is uttered on its own (by Person A), the listener assumes that the mat is
no longer spread. However, the listener (Person B) can ask whether the mat is still spread (92b),
and Person A can respond either negatively (92bi) or positively (92bii).92.     a.      Person A:       Ń       ni      kpàr bré                  ín.

"         In a negated polar question, the question particle always follows the negative particle
(105a). Note that bo becomes be in that environment;55 bo followed by a is ungrammatical54
   To complete the paradigm, an example is needed in which both instances of ín follow bo. Such an example is
predicted to be unacceptable because the most preferred order is ín bo.
55
   The bo/be alternation may just be a phonological change, but if so, it is the only one of its kind that I am aware of
in Siamou. It may also be a different negation particle which also occurs in negative imperatives (i).",[92]
"
2.3.4.2.4 NPI wo
The particle wo has some characteristics of a negative polarity item (NPI): Wo occurs mainly in
negative clauses, but it is not obligatory in negative clauses. It can also occur in certain types of
affirmative questions (Adger 2003). The data available at this point are compatible with it being
an NPI, so that is how I have chosen to gloss it.",[81]

           g.       It is sometimes useful to give questions in pairs so that the consultant can contrast
                    one form with another. For example, instead of eliciting a set of perfective
                    utterances and then a set of imperfective utterances, elicit them as minimal pairs:
                    one perfective utterance with a matching imperfective utterance.
           h.       Sometimes it is helpful to briefly explain your purpose in eliciting certain data.
                    This may prevent the consultant from getting frustrated when, for example, you
                    purposefully ask about a bunch of ungrammatical sentences to get negative data
                    and he begins to feel that all his careful teaching was in vain.","[29, 30]"
"3.2.1.3 Is There Evidence for Leftward Movement in Siamou?
This section explores three situations where movement commonly occurs cross-linguistically:
wh-questions, relative clauses and the formation of passives. (See Adger 2003.) Although this is
not the same type of movement as the verb-raising in anti-symmetry, we might expect that if a
language uses movement as a common strategy, it would be more likely to use movement to
derive its surface SOV word order. It turns out that Siamou does not use movement as a strategy
in wh-questions (3.2.1.3.1) or relative clauses (3.2.1.3.2), but it does in passives (3.2.1.3.3).",[146]

future is note-worthy, and could lead to an implicature that the meaning of bè is specifically not
part of the meaning of the priority future. This, I argue, is one possible reason that the priority
future sometimes has an interpretation of obligation or desire. If the subject is going to do
something, but not based on their own intentions, then their reason for doing it might be based on
other factors––either an outside influence (obligation), or their own influence (desire). We are
not necessarily in charge of our desires, but they may cause us to do things that we do not intend.
         The concepts introduced in this section need to be fleshed out and tested. For now, they
are simply an explanation of my current understanding of Siamou's future expressions. In the
conclusion (7.5) I list some of the questions that remain and some steps for answering them.","[387, 388]"

Secondly, imperfectives are expected to be compatible with stative verbs, but progressives are

unmarked group and marked (low tone) group. As in other Kru languages, when it is marked, it
is a tonal suffix on the verb. It does not change the segmental form of the bare verb (except for
irregular verbs in Siamou). The Siamou imperfective also resembles other Kru imperfectives in
some ways: it is always marked in some way, it bears mid tone, it has segmental content, and it is
suffixal. However, while the Siamou imperfective is marked by a nasal consonant suffix on the
verb, the Kru imperfective is generally marked by a vowel, and sometimes the consonant /l/, and
it may be either a verbal suffix or a suffix on the subject, or both. Siamou is part of the group that
marks it on the verb. Irregular imperfective forms in Siamou show some similarities with the
form of the Kru imperfective, which I show in an appendix to chapter 3, following the
conclusion.",[180]

8.2.3 Unresolved Issues in the Analysis of Siamou Aspect
The main questions regarding aspect are discussed in the following subsections. These include
aspect in subordinate clauses (8.2.3.1), the syntactic structure of aspect (8.2.3.2), and a number
of issues relating to stativity in Siamou (8.2.3.3).",[410]

(Klein 1994:103). Klein is less sure about whether or not (22) is felicitous in the case where
Mary falls asleep at some time after 2:00 and sleeps past 5:00 (23c), but concludes that it
probably is. If Mary slept from before 2:00 until after 5:00, that would be expressed with an
imperfective.23.    a.       Scenario 1: Mary was asleep before 2:00 and slept until some time before 5.00.",[204]
"7.5 Conclusion and Outstanding Questions
I have shown in this chapter how Siamou future expressions are composed. The priority future is
made up of a finiteness marker, ri, and a prospective aspect morpheme -a. The simple future has
this same suffix -a, and also contains the particle bè which is a modal, and which may encode
intention. The certain future contains the particle bè as well, and the near prospective aspect
suffix, -bɛ̂.
         The following paragraphs discuss some questions or problems that were raised by the
information in this chapter.
         In 7.3.1-7.3.3 I presented three tests to show that the Siamou futures are prospective
aspect: they have obligatory future interpretations, they occur in aspect position, and they are
compatible with past tense. However, it would be desirable to have more tests to differentiate
future tense from prospective aspect. Enç (1996) used sequence of tense effects to show that the
English future will was different from the past tense -ed. Sequence of tense data from Siamou is
complicated by the fact that ""past"" construals are often obtained in the absence of past tense. In
Siamou, it is aspect, not tense, that is (usually) obligatory in a finite clause. The relevant data is
shown in (63).",[388]

"In (15), Meredith does not directly answer the question. However, if she is co-operatively
participating in the conversation (14a), it may be assumed that what she is saying is relevant to
Ken's question (according to the maxim of relation). Without the implied meaning, this utterance
would violate principles of conversation and would not be an answer to the question (14b). Ken
should be able to work out the conversational implicature without too much difficulty (14c) (and
most likely without even thinking about the fact a conversational implicature was used).
       Implicatures have a number of characteristics (Grice 1989). First of all, they are
cancellable (Grice 1989:39). This means that a speaker can state or imply that an implied
meaning does not hold, or the context itself can cause the implicature to be cancelled. For
example, in (15), above, Meredith has made the implicature that she is not able to get together
with Ken. She could cancel this implicature by adding a clause to her utterance: I have to study
[...] but I can do that after I get home. This cancels the implicature that she has refused his
invitation and creates another implicature which is that she is accepting his invitation.
Implicatures may also be non-detachable. This means that if a certain utterance in a certain
context has a certain implicature, it will be impossible (except perhaps in special circumstances)
to find a different way to say the same thing and not have that implicature. Thirdly, although
implicatures sometimes become conventionalized, usually they are not part of the literal
meaning of an utterance. Additionally, implicatures do not have the same truth conditions as
the literal content of the utterance they are associated with. The literal content may be true and
the implicature false. (For example, suppose a younger sister finds her older sister's sweater lying
on the sofa and takes it to wear for the day. When accused by her older sister of taking her
sweater, she might reply 'I don't even know where you keep your sweater.' This is literally true,
but it implicates that she did not take it, which is not true. Finally, conversational implicatures
are often indeterminate. This means that a given utterance may be supposed to have a variety of
implicatures, any one of which would satisfy the principles of communication, and it may be
difficult to determine exactly which one the speaker intends.
       Often the lexical meaning of the utterance (e.g. I have to study) is taken to be the main
intended meaning of the utterance. However, speakers very frequently communicate ideas in an
                                                                                                  276
indirect way, and sometimes an unspoken meaning is more salient than the spoken one. The
main intended meaning of an utterance is often something more complex than simply a
development of the literal meaning of an utterance (Jaczsolt 2009, among others).
       Using this idea, we can see that implicatures could easily be the main intended meaning
of an utterance even though they are not part of its literal meaning. I will argue that this is the
case for ín in Siamou: The meaning(s) that it conveys in various contexts are not necessarily part
of its literal meaning. For example, the utterance in (16) contains the morpheme ín. I argue in
this chapter that its literal meaning is past tense. However, in this case, it does not even appear to
be contributing past tense because the same utterance without ín would also be interpreted as
past (17). The most salient meaning of (16) is either the invitation to sit down, or the speaker's
willingness to move (depending on the context).16.              Ń       kpàr búr-è             ín.

6.2.4 Abstract Meaning Hypothesis
Conversational implicatures are one possible explanation for (apparently) multi-functional
morphemes. Another possibility is that an (apparently) multi-functional morpheme actually has a
single abstract meaning. In this case, the specific meaning that the morpheme seems to have in a
particular utterance is contextually determined (Higginbotham 1983, Kay and Zimmer 1990).
This analysis has been used for multi-functional morphemes such as the English genitive suffix, -
's. This morpheme has many meanings, some of which are listed in (18) (see Nikiforidou 1991,
among others).","[298, 299]"

"4.4.1.3 Perfective Aspect Is Not Required in Contexts That Force a Past Construal
The second test to show that a morpheme is not past tense has to do with whether or not there are
events with a past interpretation that do not use this morpheme. This is also not an airtight test
because even a true past tense marker may not be required for all past contexts. For example, the
English historical present (as in (32)) is used for past contexts, even though it does not have past
morphology. However, depending on the nature of the other past-like elements in the language in

8.5 Conclusion
This work on Siamou tense and aspect has served to document previously unknown patterns and
reveal new puzzles to solve. Overall, we see that although superficially Siamou may look very
different from other languages, the kinds of tools we have developed based on other languages
are useful in the analysis of an unfamiliar tense/aspect system, and the distinctions we find in
other languages are found in Siamou as well. In the end, Siamou does not really look all that
different. In the ways that it is different, we can systematically say how it is different because of
the tools that have been developed. There are still many open questions, some of which might be
resolved by more data which would provide evidence to help us choose between different
options. I hope that this thesis has contributed to this growing literature on the typology of tense
and aspect and contributed to the understanding of the Siamou language in its own right.","[420, 421]"
"2.4.2.1.1 Prost (1964) on Siamou
Prost (1964) gives a brief overview of Siamou grammar, including the sound system: vowels,
consonants, syllable structure and tone. He observes that Siamou has a high tone and a low tone.
He also describes plural formation, definiteness, enclitics, counting, wh-questions, and more.
Prost (1964) includes Siamou with the Gur languages, and he observes that it was once
considered a Mande language. However, he says that Siamou has nothing in common with either
of these families, except for the fact that it uses the word fu for the numeral ten, which some
Mande languages also do. He hints at a possible connection with languages from Ivory Coast,
since Siamou tradition says they come from the south.",[100]
"
4.4.1.4 Perfective Aspect Combines with Past Tense
The final test to show that a morpheme is not past tense is whether or not it can combine with
past morphology. This test is stronger than the previous two. First of all, if other past
morphology exists in the language, the role of past tense marker may already be taken, which
means the morpheme in question is likely not past tense.141 Secondly, we would not expect the
past tense to be marked twice by two distinct morphemes in one utterance. If one morpheme is
already marking past, the other one is likely doing something else.",[216]

"5.6 Conclusion
The main purpose of this chapter was to show that the Siamou L tone verbal suffix is a perfective
aspect morpheme and that the Siamou M tone -n suffix is an imperfective aspect morpheme. This
means that they are part of Siamou's grammatical aspect paradigm. In order to accomplish this, I
needed to provide theoretical background on three syntactic categories: tense, grammatical
aspect, and lexical aspect. This is because these three categories interact in a myriad of ways,
often resulting in default readings that can make it difficult to determine the actual function of a
given morpheme.
            These results raise questions about the nature of other verb classes in Siamou. Although I
did not specifically attempt to show that Siamou distinguishes accomplishments, achievements
and activities, the analysis of the perfective and imperfective seems to confirm the existence of
these classes. For example, the test for culmination entailments of perfective verbs serves to
distinguish activities, which do not have culmination entailments, from accomplishments and
achievements, which do have culmination entailments.
            In the process of this analysis, an important discovery was made: Siamou does not (as far
as I can tell) have stative main verbs. Rather, Siamou has a number of strategies for expressing
stativity, including a class of inchoative verbs that occasionally have result state readings, but
which actually make the coming-to-be of a stative situation more salient than the stative situation
itself.
            The findings of this chapter also call into question the existence of the factative effect in
other Kru languages. Perhaps further investigation would reveal that a better understanding of
Kru verb classes would do away with the need for a ""factative"" in these languages.",[289]

    It is an interesting question, however, why some accomplishments can have an inceptive reading and others can
not. Another example of an accomplishment with an inceptive reading is At 2:00 the old man counted his money.
160
    If a morpheme is already known to be a perfective, this test may also show indirectly that an utterance has a
(grammatical aspect) initial point because if it is perfective, it can not lack both initial and final points. However,
this is not very helpful because we are testing final points to determine if something is a perfective in the first place.
161
    Note that Bar-el (2005) is looking at initial points that are given by lexical aspect (i.e. the situation type has a
BECOME operator). I am looking at initial points that are given by grammatical aspect (i.e. the beginning of the event
is inside the reference time).",[225]

5.5.2.4 Implications for Kru
If Siamou perfective-marked verbs that have a present stative interpretation can be analyzed as a
result state entailment of inchoative verbs, this leads to the question of whether the present
stative readings in other Kru languages (or even other Niger-Congo languages) can be analyzed
the same way. It would be interesting to see if verbs that are interpreted as stative in these
languages ever have inchoative readings as well, and in what syntactic environments those
readings arise. It is possible that the analysis given here for Siamou would work in these
languages as well. Perhaps Kru languages actually have no stative verbs, but only inchoative
verbs that may have a result state interpretation (especially in the perfective). One piece of
evidence to support this hypothesis comes from Kouya, another Kru language. In Kouya the
perfective of the verb za is glossed as an inchoative ('redden'), but it has a stative interpretation,
either present or past (68) (Saunders 2009).",[288]

        d.      [the x: blanket (x) & my grandma designed the pattern for x]        The question I seek to answer in the following pages is which analysis (accidental
homophony, polysemy, conversational implicature, or abstract meaning), or which combination
of these analyses, best explains the apparent multi-functionality of ín. In the next section (6.3), I
show that its primary meaning is past tense, and then in section 6.4 I show that its other
meanings can all be attributed to conversational implicature.6.3. ín Shifts Reference Time to Past
This chapter argues that ín is a past tense morpheme. However, there is no concensus on what
the relevant criteria are for determining this. Semantically, the only criterion for a morpheme to
be called past tense is that it serves to shift or restrict the reference time to the past (Reichenbach
1947, Klein 1994, Stowell 2007, among others). In that case, ín fits the (semantic) definition of
past tense, as I show below.
        There are also syntactic criteria to determine what counts as a tense. These include
obligatoriness and paradigmatic contrast (Comrie 1995, Binnick 2012, Wiltschko 2014). Using
these criteria, ín is not a past tense because it is not obligatory (as shown in chapter 5). It is also
not in contrast with any other tense morpheme since Siamou does not have a present tense or a
future tense. Based on these two diagnostics, ín might be better diagnosed as an adverbial.
However, it does not fit the criteria for adverbs in Siamou. First of all, it does not have the same
distribution as adverbs (as shown in chapter 2). Secondly, it does not have the phonology of a
Siamou adverb. In Siamou, no adverbs are vowel-initial, and in fact almost no lexical
morphemes at all are vowel-initial (see Table 2.5). This information is summarized in Table 6.1
Using this data, it is not possible to determine whether ín is a tense or an adverb. If obligatoriness
and paradigmatic contrasts are the main criteria, then ín is an adverb. However, if so, it is a very
unusual Siamou adverb because of its distribution and phonology. For me, the most important
criterion for past tense is the semantic one, and when I argue that ín instantiates past tense, I am
arguing that it has a past reference time, and I recognize that this requires me to stipulate that it is
not obligatory and not in contrast with any other tense markers in th language.","[300, 301]"

Since futurity is tied up with modality, this chapter contains a survey of the literature on
modality. This includes a discussion of the ingredients of modality: the modal base, the ordering
source and the modal force, as well as two ways that modal expressions can be classified:
Kratzer's (1991) and Portner's (2009). It also includes an overview of different ways that modals
can be underspecified in languages, and how modality interacts with futurity. I look at four
different ways of analyzing ""future modals"" in various languages. They have been analyzed as
pure modals, as a fusion (into a single morpheme) of modality and aspect, as a combination of
modality and aspect (using two or more morphemes), and as modals that are either aspectual or
non-aspectual. In Siamou, future expressions are best analyzed as a combination of prospective
aspect and modality, as evidenced by a number of diagnostics. The final part of this chapter is a
first pass at decomposing Siamou's future expressions to justify the tree in (15). This chapter is
the final body chapter of this thesis and it is the most speculative and the least conclusive. At the
end of this chapter there is a discussion of some outstanding questions and a set of extra data on
future expressions that was not included in the analysis, but which may be useful for further
work on this topic.",[37]

       Along with truth conditions, felicity conditions are an important component of the
meaning of an utterance. Felicity conditions are the facts about a situation that are required in
order for an utterance to be judged appropriate in that situation. Sometimes the structure of a
sentence affects its felicity conditions (Austin 1975, Matthewson 2004). For example, (8a) and
(8b) have different structures. The sentence in (8b) is a clefted version of (8a), where the subject
(your mom) is moved and put in focus.8.     a.      Your mom answered the phone.
       b.      It was your mom who answered the phone.","[197, 198]"
"4.4.1.2 Perfective Aspect Need Not Be Construed as Past
Without additional contextual information, a morpheme that has a past interpretation in an out-
of-the-blue context is just as likely to be a marker of past tense as it is to be a marker of
perfective aspect. Therefore, the next step in testing whether or not a morpheme is perfective
aspect is to verify that it is not past tense. That is the focus of this and the following two
diagnostics. These diagnostics on their own are not conclusive. However, if all of them are
considered together, they strengthen each other, and may be considered strong evidence. The
first diagnostic has to do with whether or not the morpheme in question can ever be useevents
that do not have a past interpretation. If it usually has a past interpretation, and if that
interpretation does not occur in all contexts, it may in fact be a marker of perfective aspect. This138
    In contrast, imperfectives often have a default present interpretation (Smith 1997), as I discuss in 4.4.2.1.
139
    If we take the present to be an instantaneous moment, then the bounded event constraint might not even be
necessary, but would fall out naturally (see Bennett and Partee (1978) and Reis Silva and Matthewson (2007).
140
    This constraint does not prevent a perfective from being interpreted as a future event. However, future
interpretations are usually marked and are not arrived at by default. Smith (2008) uses the Simplicity Principle of
Interpretation to rule out future interpretations.",[215]
"Sequence of tense readings need to be tested more rigorously, controlling for both tense marking
and aspect marking, and bearing in mind that ""past"" readings are not always the result of past
tense.
         I proposed in this chapter that ri marks finiteness and bè marks intentional modality.
However, I have not pursued these claims. In order to determine whether ri actually marks
finiteness, I need to more thoroughly test its distribution in finite clauses. Its tendency to drop out
in casual speech makes it more difficult to analyze. For example, in non-verbal predicates, ri is
often absent. However, I do not know whether it is required in such clauses in careful speech, or                                                                                                   367
if it simply does not occur with certain non-verbal predicates. I also need to look at non-finite
predicates, such as those containing the non-finite particle ki, to contrast them with ri-clauses and
determine whether or not there is any overlap.
       The analysis of the particle bè also left many questions unanswered. Is a unified analysis
of bè in all its contexts of use possible, or even desirable? I proposed that bè marks intentional
modality. However, it occurs in many future expressions that do not seem to be about intention.
It also occurs in some non-future expressions (for example, subordinate clauses and non-verbal
predicates) that are not about intention either.
       I argued that the three future expressions all encode modality, and that the bè futures are
(at least sometimes) about intention, and the ri future is about non-intention, leading to a priority
modal reading. More tests need to be done to find out what kinds of modal bases and ordering
sources these future expressions are compatible with.
       Finally, the prospective aspect 2 suffix, -bɛ̂ is not compatible without bè. That is, there is
no ri. . .-bɛ̂ future expression in Siamou. A complete analysis of these future expressions should
provide an explanation for this. One possibility is that if -bɛ̂ implies that a set of steps leading up
to the event is already in progress, perhaps this means that it has gone beyond a vague idea such
as desire or obligation, and the ""intentional"" reading provided by bè is obligatory.
       I leave this work on futures for future work.","[389, 390]"

8.3 What Siamou Teaches Us About Context
       This dissertation makes reference to Matthewson's (2004) paper on semantic fieldwork
methodology, which advocates against the use of translations as evidence in semantic fieldwork.
Translations are seen as simply one clue among many. In my work, it is very important to use
contextualized utterances to make semantic claims about Siamou. For example, I use utterances
such as (39), repeated from 5.1.2.1, to claim that the Siamou perfective has a default past
interpretation. This example shows that yɛn 'yawn.PRFV' has a strong default past interpretation
and it is only compatible in a context that allows a past perfective reading. The utterance is
infelicitous in a past imperfective context as well as a present progressive and present habitual
context. This shows that Siamou perfectives as they are used in real-life, and not simply spoken
out-of-the-blue, are interpreted as past.39.    a.      À     ri        yɛn.

       By hypothesis, ín is a lexical past tense marker, and the utterance has a default past
interpretation without ín. Co-operative communication principles require the listener to assume
that the speaker has some reason for adding a past tense marker to an utterance that is already
interpreted as past, and this causes the inference that the event might be more distant in the past.
The context also has to support the listener's inference. If, for example, the context supports the
inference that the speaker is trying to be polite, rather than indicate remoteness, then there will be
no remoteness implicature.
       Unlike remote past tenses in many other languages, ín does not have a temporal cut-off
point. It is compatible with events earlier on the same day, or events from yesterday, or events
from the distant past. It serves to make whatever event predicate it modifies more remote, but
there is no clear indication of what counts as remote. This indeterminacy is odd for a remote past
tense marker, but expected of an implicature.
       The fact that implicatures are non-detachable leads us to ask why past tense markers in
other languages, such as English -ed do not have a remoteness implicature. Example (77a) has a
present interpretation, and (77b), with -ed, has a past interpretation, but no remoteness
implicature.77.    a.      I answer the phone.

               asleep and finishing before she woke up)Then, using only the Siamou phrases, I attempted to determine in what types of contexts these
phrases were felicitous. In particular, I tried to determine whether or not utterances with a
perfective verb were used for situations in which the event time was contained within the
reference time (i.e. a Kratzer-type (1998) perfective, or a sub-type of Klein's (1994) perfectives),
and whether or not utterances with an imperfective verb were used for events in which the
reference time was contained within the event time. Note that for (26b), a context in which the
man reads the whole book while his wife is asleep was accepted. This is consistent with it being
a perfective utterance. However, I was not able to determine the felicity status of a context in
which he began reading before she fell asleep and continued after she woke up.
       For the most part I was not able to get consistent results for these utterances. Part of the
issue may be my method of asking questions. Since French is not my first language, there is
always the possibility of a misunderstanding based on my wording of questions. Another
confounding issue may be the fact that the Siamou translations of the French phrases reverse the
order of the main and subordinate clauses, so that the French phrase is literally She cooked tô
while I watched her and the Siamou phrase is literally The time at which she cooked tô, at that
time I was watching her. Therefore, in one language the perfective aspect-marked phrase she
cooked tô occurs in the main clause and in the other it occurs in the subordinate clause. The
examples in (28) above are of perfective-marked verbs in subordinate clauses. The examples in
(29) are the imperfective counterparts to the phrases in (28). Contextual information is not
available for these examples either.","[412, 413]"

that are not included in Kratzer's (1998) definition. In order to determine if this is so, it is
important to pay attention to exactly how R and E overlap. In the diagrams in (25), the first and
third perfectives (25a,c) have an event time that begins inside the reference time. In other words,
the initial point of E is in R. The second and third perfectives (25b-c) have an event time that
ends inside the reference time. That is, the final point of E is in R. Since the reference time is a
time that is relevant in the discourse in some way, we expect the initial points of (25a,c) to be
relevant, and we expect the final points of (25b-c) to be relevant. Therefore, in order to
determine which perfective aspect a morpheme represents, we need to test whether or not the
initial and final points of E are inside R.
        Testing the initial and final points of E is complicated by the fact that if an event
described by a perfective-marked utterance lacks an initial or final point, this may be due to
either lexical aspect or grammatical aspect. It may be difficult to tell which one, especially since
they are interdependent. For example, if a perfective-marked activity event has no final point
within the reference time, it may be because activities have no final points or it may be because
the perfective in question refers to an event that has no final point within the reference time. My
goal is not to untangle them, but simply to determine whether or not perfective aspect does
sometimes refer to events that lack either an initial point or a final point within the reference
time, as Klein (1994) predicts. (It can never lack both because that is an imperfective in both
Klein (1994) and Kratzer's (1998) definitions.)
        Some data accords better with Klein's (1994) broader meaning approach to the perfective.
Allowing a perfective to lack a final point easily accounts for the inceptive reading that
perfectives may have with punctual adverbs in languages such as Skwxwú7mesh (Bar-el 2005)).
One potential problem with adopting Klein's perfective is a lack of solid evidence (besides the
vague intuitions of native English speakers such as that given in (16-17)) that perfectives can
lack initial points. However, this does not mean that such evidence does not exist. I have not
found any satisfactory test for initial points at all, so this is an area of research that needs
attention.","[206, 207]"

If this is the structure of Siamou aspect, then we expect stacking of aspectual morphemes. The
tree predicts that the perfective and imperfective could combine with any of the other four
aspects, but not with each other.101 It also predicts that none of the other four aspects should be
able to combine with each other. This second prediction is shown to be true in (58). All twelve

conclusions about whether this is actually stacking or not, although I suspect it is not. I simply
present what I know and leave the rest for future work.
        The first case of possible stacking involves the imperfective. It is possible to manipulate
the Siamou verb stem in two ways in order to alter the meaning of the utterance. In (59), I show
one example of this changed verb stem using the verb kú (to die) with the prospective aspect 1
suffix, -a. In (59a), the verb stem is unaltered. In (59b), the tone of the verb stem has changed
(from high to high-mid), and a nasal consonant has been added to the right edge, and the
meaning of the utterance includes stronger certainty. In (59c), the tone has changed even more
drastically to become quite a long contour, and there is a nasal consonant at the right edge, as in
(59b). The utterance in (59c) has more semantic intensity than (59a-b).","[161, 162]"

"Unlike the /tuw/ case, this morpheme has exactly the same distribution no matter which meaning
it receives, which can be seen in the phrases in (18). Moreover, it is possible to show that the
different functions of this morpheme are semantically related to each other.
        The abstract meaning analysis states that the morpheme 's simply indicates that some
unspecified relation exists between two entities (Kay and Zimmer 1990, also see Partee and
Borschev 1998, 1999). The only way to determine the nature of this relation is to rely on context.
For example, the phrase in (19) could have any of the meanings listed in (19a-e).19.     my grandma's blanket        a.       a blanket my grandma owns
        b.       a blanket my grandma made
        c.       a blanket my grandma sleeps under when she stays with us
        d.       a blanket made using a quilt pattern designed by my grandma
        e.       a blanket I inherited from my grandmaSuppose I were to visit my mother-in-law and found that she had started on a new quilt using my
grandma's pattern. I might say to her, Oh, you're making my grandma's blanket! In that case, the
meaning would have to be the one in (19d). Or, suppose a friend came to stay with me for a
week, and needed some bedding to use. I have a big supply of blankets in the back closet, but
one of them is reserved for my grandma, so I tell her, You can use any of these blankets except
that one- it's my grandma's blanket. In that case, the meaning would be the one in (19c).
        Higginbotham (1983) formalizes this theory as follows: A genitive phrase is represented
as in (20a), where NP1 is the genitive-marked noun phrase214 and N' is the thing that is possessed.
The meaning of 's is expanded in (20b), which states that for the unique entity, x, x is N' and x is
in some relation (R) to NP1 (from Higginbotham (1983:397–398). If the specific NP in question
is my grandma's blanket (20c), and the context is the one from (19d), then the representation in
(20b) can be filled out as in (20d).",[300]

Above the aspect phrase there is a locative phrase which contains two particles fɔn 'be here' and
mí 'be there.' I put these two particles in the same syntactic position because they are in
complementary distribution and because they are both locatives. I put them at the bottom of all
the functional particles because whenever they occur with another pre-predicate particle they are
always to the right of the other particle (e.g. ri fɔn, wo mí) (see 2.3.4.2.8).
        The head right above the locative phrase I have called a functional phrase (FP), for lack
of a better name, and it contains the modal particle bè and the negative polarity particle wo. I put
                                                                                                  50
these particles in the same syntactic position because they never co-occur. I put them above the
locative phrase because wo precedes mí if they co-occur (wo mí).
        The next level up is the finite phrase which contains the non-finite particle ki and the
finite particle ri. (The labels for these particles is also tentative.) I put these particles in the same
syntactic position because they never co-occur and because they both seem to have something to
do with finiteness. If ki or ri occur with another pre-predicate particle, they are always to the left
of the other particle (e.g. ki bè, ri bè, ki wo, ri mí).
        Above the finite phrase is the TP, which contains the right edge particle ín. This particle
precedes all other right edge particles (see 2.3.4.3). I placed the TP as close as possible to the
finite phrase, since I expect both of them to be part of the IP.
        The phrase above TP is the NegP which contains the right edge particle bo (sometimes
be) NEG. I put this particle above ín PAST because ín always precedes bo (although see (103a.)).
        Above this is the CP, which contains the pre-predicate particle nì 'if/when.' This particle
is in complementary distribution with ki and ri in the finite phrase. Nonetheless, I chose to give it
its own position because of its function. That is, it seems to fit into the CP better than the IP.
        Immediately above the CP is another functional phrase that contains two right-edge
particles: a polar question particle a and an emphatic particle na. I put these particles in the same
position because they never co-occur. I put them above the NegP because they always follow
negation (be a, bo na).
        The highest level in the tree is the quotative phrase which contains the quotative particle
dé. I placed this particle at the top because it precedes all other elements of the phrase. Since I
am focusing on functional particles, this tree does not include the subject of the sentence.
However, I assume that the subject is generated inside the VP and raises to a position higher in
the clause. In Siamou the subject precedes all pre-predicate particles. The only particle that
precedes the subject is the quotative dé. Therefore, the subject likely raises as high as the CP.
        The subsections below look in more detail at each these functional elements. In 2.3.4.1 I
introduce the quotative, dé, in 2.3.4.2 the set of seven pre-predicate particles, and 2.3.4.3 the set
of four right-edge particles. The final section, 2.3.4.4, is about some unusual verb stems.","[72, 73]"
