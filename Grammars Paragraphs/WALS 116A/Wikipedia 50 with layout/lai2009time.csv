"       The last type of clause in which caa negation is used is in yes-no questions. Ascan be seen in (278), caa precedes the pronominal subject even if the sentence is aquestion. Yes-no questions and declarative sentences are structurally the same in Iquito.",[188]

(He will be reading this book now.)In addition to affirmative declaratives, realis mood is also used in past and presentnegative declaratives (245), as well as interrogatives, including yes-no questions (246)and wh-questions (247). The following three sentences all have SVO word order, withsubject pronouns preceding verbs in (245) and (246), and a subject interrogative pronounpreceding the verb in (245).",[171]
"The only difference resides in the intonation contour at the end of the sentence, with yes-
no questions displaying a rising pattern.",[188]
"In (288), caa appears between the questioned subject and the verb marked with -ji. Thenegative particle caa does not appear again in the postverbal position and the sentence isgrammatical.",[194]
"Other cases of ji-caa negation, besides embedded clauses of cleft constructions, are wh-questions and relative clauses. The speakers always interpret them in the same way theyinterpret clefts, and they frequently insert the copular t++.74 Consider example (300).",[198]
"The question word in the sentence is the direct object. The subject is a pronoun nu ‘3S’and caa appears after it in the preverbal position, which forms the SXV word order toexpress the irrealis mood. The indirect object remains in the postverbal position.",[193]
"                                            172
In addition to wh-questions, relative clauses also adopt ji-caa negation. As can be seen in(281), this sentence consists of a principal clause and a relative clause. In the principalclause, the negative particle caa precedes the pronominal subject and in the relativeclause, caa follows the verb which is additionally marked with -ji.","[190, 191]"
"       In the types of clauses introduced above, the negative particle caa follows theverb. As can be seen in (280) which is a wh-question, caa is in the postverbal positionand -ji is marked after the verbal root, as part of the verbal complex. It is noted that -jiappears after the verbal root to which only derivational morphemes attach. This suggeststhat in Iquito -ji is considered a derivational morpheme.",[190]

"        The data collected during my 2006 dissertation fieldwork consists of around 130hours of recordings, including texts, elicitation and consultation (i.e. discussion of
elicitation, questions, contexts, and texts). The content of texts and elicitation wastranscribed, analyzed and translated into English as presented in this dissertation. Theconsultation part, however, is in Spanish and, therefore, was not transcribed. For theanalysis of text, I transcribed in 3-second intervals for around 5 minutes of texts, and thenI had consultation sessions with the speakers for the translation and analysis; I repeated12 To assist in the task of building the dictionary, I made word lists that included example sentences,
definition, and function of the word as I encountered a new lexical item, and I handed the lists over to the
person in charge, Lev D. Michael. He then would enter these words into the SHOEBOX database. The
ILDP dictionary has been useful and I would like to acknowledge Lev’s extensive work on the dictionary.

this process until the entire text was done; I went over the translated and transcribed textswith a few other speakers for other analysis-related opinions. The elicitation, generallybased on the above-mentioned questionnaires and modified sentences and questions fromthe texts, and the consultation sessions, usually went together, so I transcribed as I askedthe questions. The estimated transcribed words number around 8000 in Source Language.","[55, 56]"
Sentence (554) is a question and was elicited in the following context: the addresseebeing asked moved to the speaker’s village several years ago and the speaker asks if theaddressee met the speaker’s brother before moving to the village. The RT of the principalclause is ‘the moment when you arrived that year.’ The event [you meet (you start toknow)] took place before the RT.,[314]
"The information a viewpoint presents is affected by the structure of the situation. Thisleads us to the point that aspectual viewpoints are independent of situation types asassumed in the two-component theory. The main semantic distinction among aspectualviewpoints is how much of a situation they make visible. Perfective viewpoints focus a
                                            26
situation as a whole and include endpoints while imperfective viewpoints focus aninterval and exclude endpoints. The evidence for the semantic meanings of aspectualviewpoints comes from semantic tests: conjunctions and questions. Conjunction is basedon the compatibility of two assertions. Open situations are compatible with assertions thatthe situation continues or terminates without completion, which means the imperfectiveviewpoint does not entail the completion of the situation and, hence, the final endpoint ofthe event is not visible. Closed situations, on the other hand, are not compatible withassertions that the situation continues or terminates without completion, which means theperfective viewpoint entails the completion of the situation and, hence, the final endpointof the event is visible. Crosslinguistically, there are different manifestations of perfectiveaspects; some languages have terminative closure instead of completive closure and somelanguages include a post stage, etc. Before- and after- clauses are also useful to test if thefinal endpoint of a situation is semantically visible. When- clauses can distinguish theimperfective viewpoint from others because a sequential reading would not be availablefor it. Questions also function as tests to discover the semantic meaning of a sentence: aclosed situation is not compatible with a question which asks about its continuation.","[44, 45]"
"4.3.2 Ji-caa Negation       Ji-caa negation uses the negative particle caa, plus an additional negativemorpheme -ji attached to the verb root, to negate a clause. This strategy is used in thefollowing types of clauses: wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleftconstructions. Complement and adverbial clauses can adopt either caa negation or ji-caanegation. In ji-caa negation, both -ji and caa contribute to the negation meaning. Thenegative marker -ji is a portmanteau morpheme which encodes both the negation and theclause-type information. The fact that it also conveys the negation meaning is supportedby two pieces of evidence. First, it is ungrammatical for it to appear in an affirmative
                                           171
clause; second, in some cases, caa is omitted while the clause still retains its negationmeaning. It is possible to consider ji-caa negation as a type of negative agreement since itagrees with the type of the clause it occurs. However, it is unlike a typical inflectionalagreement marker for the following reasons. First, it cannot appear freely in any negativeclause, but only in wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleftconstructions. Second, it attaches to the root (as opposed to stem) form of the verb, whichindicates that it behaves more like a derivational morpheme in Iquito. Diagram 7 showsthat the negative particle caa follows the inflected verb and the negative morpheme -ji issuffixed to the verbal root, preceding tense and aspect information.","[189, 190]"
                                                                             Yes. Yes. Yes.,[616]
"       In pursuit of a thorough and systematic corpus, I adopted Dahl’s (1985, 2000)methods, which use questionnaires as an essential approach to data collection, in May2006, when I began my dissertation research. Among the questionnaires that I used wereDahl’s (1985) “TMA Questionnaire,” Dahl’s (2000) “The Future Time ReferenceQuestionnaire,” “The Perfect Questionnaire” and “Questionnaire on the ProgressiveAspect.” I adapted and contextualized the questions in these questionnaires according tospecific cultural traditions to prevent speakers from directly translating the sentences.",[54]
"       Unlike caa negation, ji-caa negation presents many syntactic variations sensitiveto mood (i.e. in irrealis clauses). The negative particle in such clauses can appear after theverb, as in the basic pattern, before and after the verb, or only before the verb in somecases. Recalling the requirement of irrealis mood (i.e. one element should occupy theposition between the subject and the verb), when this requirement is fulfilled, then caa                                             173
stays in the postverbal position, maintaining the basic pattern. When the object of aclause is dislocated to form a wh-question, or stays in the postverbal position, thenegative particle caa appears between the subject and the verb, by which the requirementof irrealis mood is fulfilled. Sometimes, when caa already appears in the preverbalposition, it does not appear again in the postverbal position. In each variation, the verb isobligatorily marked with the negative morpheme -ji.","[191, 192]"

        In the following, I briefly discuss the precise analytical criteria (i.e. linguisticcorrelates) and the semantic tests I employ in determining the various temporal andaspectual meanings in question. The information introduced here should be combinedwith the detailed explanations of the theoretical background and tests outlined in §2.1 andin respective chapters and sections of different TMA categories. Smith defines the tensecategory as an obligatory morpheme in the sentence. Temporal interpretation is directlyattained from tense in tensed languages. Therefore, the first criterion of determiningwhether a morpheme in question is a tense is its obligatory status in a finite sentence. If itis optional, most likely13 it is a temporal adverb. If a morpheme is truly a tense category,even if a temporal adverb, such as ‘yesterday,’ which explicitly indicates RT, appears, thetense, such as the past tense in English, is still required in the sentence and the lack ofsuch a tense would result in ungrammaticality. The second criterion I propose is thecompatibility of such a morpheme and temporal adverbials; this criterion also serves todetermine the temporal meaning of a tense morpheme. If a morpheme yields a pastinterpretation, it could be a past tense or a perfective—or even an imperfective—aspect.","[56, 57]"

"4.3.3 The Scope of Negation and the Function of the Two Strategies      In addition to the syntactic characteristics (i.e. type of clause) discussed above,there is a correlation between the negation strategy, the scope of negation and the
                                           178
pragmatic function: caa negation has scope over the entire clause while ji-caa negationhas scope over only the verb phrase, excluding the subject of the clause. For example, inwh-questions, the wh-word is not negated; only the rest of the clause is negated. This hasmuch to do with the function of the two negation strategies: caa negation negates theclause without focusing any element, but ji-caa negation focuses the first element of theclause and negates the rest of the clause. This corresponds to the fact that wh-questions,relative clauses and embedded clauses are similar to cleft constructions, not onlystructurally (i.e. using ji-caa negation) but also functionally (i.e. generally interpreted byspeakers as clefts and the first element focused). Recall also the phenomenon such thatadverbial and complement clauses can adopt both negation strategies. In Iquito, thesyntactic status of these types of clauses can be treated as subordinate clauses as well ascoordinated clauses. In addition, it is noted that this variation also corresponds todifferent pragmatic functions (i.e. whether the first element of the clause focused or not).","[196, 197]"

"Most tenses take utterance time as the deictic center in independent principal clauses, butthey can depend on reference time in some cases. I study the Iquito patterns of differentclause types (e.g. subordinate clauses, when clauses, etc.) and the discourse of narratives                                             2
in light of the well-established facts in Smith (1991, 1997, 2003). 3) Is future expressedby a modal category or tense, or a combination of both? 4) Is the tense category restrictedto a certain type of situation, e.g. stative or dynamic? 5) How many viewpoint aspectsand morphemes of temporal function are there in Iquito? 6) Does aspect interact withmodal constructions? 7) Does aspect contribute to temporal interpretation? 8) Doviewpoint aspect and lexical aspect of predicates interact? In answering all theaforementioned questions, the goal of the dissertation research is to define the Iquitotense, mood and aspect categories, and to discover their interactions and patterns ofobligatoriness. This dissertation pursues a thorough understanding of the temporal systemof the Iquito Language.","[20, 21]"
"       There are two principal strategies of clausal negation in Iquito: one uses thenegative particle caa (referred to as caa negation hereafter) and the other uses thenegative morpheme -ji in combination with the negative particle caa (referred to as ji-caanegation hereafter). In caa negation, the negative particle caa precedes a pronominalsubject or a non-topicalized subject phrase, and follows a topicalized element if any. Thisstrategy is generally used in principal/independent declarative clauses and yes/noquestions. In ji-caa negation, the negative particle caa follows an inflected verb, in whichthe verbal root is followed by the negative morpheme -ji, followed by tense and aspectinformation. This strategy is generally used in wh-questions, relative clauses, andembedded clauses of cleft constructions. While caa negation does not have variation inirrealis mood, ji-caa negation varies structurally in irrealis clauses. The negative particlecaa in ji-caa negation may appear repetitively in the postverbal position as well as inpreverbal position if no other elements appear between the subject and the verb of anirrealis clause (detailed in §4.3.2). In adverbial and complement clauses, either one ofthese two strategies can be used.",[186]
