      9. echu          ‗to take off‘
     10. chabo         ‗to put away‘
Exercise 10. Completive aspect stimulus response drill
The teacher gives the stimulus in the form of a yes/no question. The student replies using the correct form of the
completive aspect suffix. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example     Teacher: ¿Ome sabured pakne?
            Student: Chuli. Pato mol pakcha.
    Frame Chuli. Pato mol ____.         ‗No, (she) already ____ a blouse.‘
     1. ¿Ome sabured pakne?             ‗Is the woman going to buy the skirt?‘
     2. ¿Ome sabured enukne?            ‗Is the woman going to wash the skirt?‘
     3. ¿Ome sabured chune?             ‗Is the woman going to fetch the skirt?‘
     4. ¿Ome sabured makne?             ‗Is the woman going to sew the skirt?‘
     5. ¿Ome sabured chikne?            ‗Is the woman going to cut out the skirt?‘
     6. ¿Ome sabured chabone?           ‗Is the woman going to put away the skirt?‘
     7. ¿Ome sabured ukne?              ‗Is the woman going to sell the skirt?‘
     8. ¿Ome sabured amine?             ‗Is the woman going to look for the skirt?‘4.4.3 Content Questions (Ex. 11–18)
Content questions are questions which require something other than yes/no answers (see 3.2.3.2). The
information required is signalled in English by a question word such as ―Who?,‖ ―What?,‖ ―When?,‖ etc. In
Kuna, there are three types of content questions: amplificatory questions, topic-establishing questions, and
confirmation questions.","[51, 52]"
"3.2.3.2 Intonation pattern of questions
A question has a different intonation pattern from a statement. The actual order of words in a question which requires
a yes/no answer is the same order as for a statement. Because the word order does not vary, it is important that you
learn the intonation patterns for questions versus statements in order to distinguish a question from an answer.
In Kuna, the pitch at which the question is said is higher than the pitch of a statement. The last word of a
question is even higher pitch than the rest of the question and then the pitch of that word falls off quickly.
Exercise 5. Yes/no question intonation drill
Mimic the intonation of the teacher by humming the the intonation of the following questions.
      1. ¿Pe mas chikne?                       ‗Are you going to cut plantains?‘
      2. ¿Pe mol pakne?                        ‗Are you going to buy cloth?‘
      3. ¿Pe ogob tigne?                       ‗Are you going to plant the coconut?‘
      4. ¿Pe ua tune?                          ‗Are you going to cook the fish?‘
      5. ¿Machi ob kunne?                      ‗Is the boy going to eat the corn?‘
      6. ¿Machi chowal chikne?                 ‗Is the boy going to cut the firewood?‘
26                                                                                          Conversational RepliesExercise 6. Yes/No question intonation pattern drill
The teacher drills the class using Sentences 1–5 below as yes/no questions.
Example       Teacher: ¿Machi ob kunne?
              Student: ¿Machi ob kunne?
      1. ¿Machi ob kunne?                ‗Is the boy going to eat corn?‘
      2. ¿Machi mas chikne?              ‗Is the boy going to cut plantains?‘
      3. ¿Machi immal amine?             ‗Is the boy going to hunt (something)?‘
      4. ¿Machi ina komne?               ‗Is the boy going to drink the medicine?‘
      5. ¿Machi ul chune?                ‗Is the boy going to fetch the canoe?‘
Note: The lenis consonant b becomes m when it occurs before n
Example       kob + -ne = komne               ‗going to drink‘
Exercise 7. Statement intonation pattern drill
The teacher drills the students using Sentences 1–5 below as statements.
Example      Teacher: Machi ob kunne.
             Student: Machi ob kunne.
      1. Machi ob kunne.                      ‗The boy is going to eat corn.‘
      2. Machi mas chikne.                    ‗The boy is going to cut plantains.‘
      3. Machi immal amine.                   ‗The boy is going to hunt (something).‘
      4. Machi ina komne.                     ‗The boy is going to drink the medicine.‘
      5. Machi ul chune.                      ‗The boy is going to fetch the canoe.‘
Exercise 8. Question and statement contrast
The teacher says one of the sentences above. The student has to identify whether the teacher has uttered a
question or a statement and writes ―question‖ or ―statement‖ on his answer sheet.
Examples         Teacher (says):        ¿Machi immal amine?
                 Student (writes):      question
                 Teacher (says):        Machi mas chikne.
                 Student (writes):      statement
If difficulty is experienced by the student in hearing the differences in the exercise, then the student should
practice Exercise 9.
Exercise 9. Question and statement contrast
The student should listen while the teacher repeats Sentences 1–5 in Exercise 6 above. The teacher then inserts
the following sentence between Sentences 4 and 5 as a statement (A) or as a question (B). The student has to tell
the teacher which has been used -- a question or a statement. The exercise should be repeated several times.
     A. Machi ua makne.                       ‗The boy is going to spear fish.‘
     B. ¿Machi ua makne?                      ‗Is the boy going to spear fish?‘
Exercise 10. Question and statement contrast
Repeat Exercise 9 using the statements in Exercise 7. Again, the student needs to distinguish whether the
statement (A) or the question (B) has been inserted.
Note: After Exercises 9 and 10 are successfully completed, Exercise 8 should be repeated.","[38, 39]"
"3.4.5.1 Change of subject
A common use of the change of subject suffix is the exchange of greetings. One person may ask, ―How are
you?‖ Then the other person answers, ―I am fine. How are you?‖ In this case, the you refers back to the first
speaker. The subject of the dialogue has changed. A Kuna speaker would signal such a change of subject by the
use of the suffix -din.
Example
       Visitor :           ¿Pe igi oipos?           ‗How are you this morning?‘
       Villager:           Ampala. ¿Pedin?          ‗So-so. And you?‘3.4.5.2 Contrast of subject
Kunas also use the suffix -din/-tin to mark a contrast between what two subjects are doing.
Example             Machidin ua makne.                 ‗On the one hand, the boy is going to spear fish.‘
                    Omedin ua tune.                    ‗On the other hand, the woman is going to cook fish.‘
1
    Helps for distinguishing between short and long fortis consonants at the end of words are given in 4.2.2.
2
    -din becomes -tin after a fortis consonant.

  Beginning with this lesson, both the long and short forms of words—where two exist—are given in the vocabulary.
Parentheses enclose the vowel that is dropped for the short form. If the consonant changes, the two forms are separated by
commas.
                                                4 QUESTIONS
4.1 Dialogue
Question words are extremely useful in finding your way among strangers in a new place. When you have only
partial control of the language, you can question someone until you fully understand what they have been
saying. By fully using the question words—several of which are included in Dialogue 4.1—you can continue a
conversation for a reasonable time, even though you have very little control of the language. They also help the
language learner to become better acquainted with the language and culture.
Wife to her husband about visitors in their village:
      1.    Wife:              ¿Toa noni?                           ‗Who has arrived?‘
      2.    Husband:           Waga.                                ‗An outsider!‘
      3.    Wife:              Mmm. ¿Inkwa noni?                    ‗Hmm. When did he arrive?‘
      4.    Husband:           Immis.                               ‗Today./Just now.‘
      5.    Wife:              Immis. ¿Ibi pei?                     ‗Oh, today. What does he want?‘
      6.    Husband:           Chuli. Kinki pakcha.                 ‗Nothing. He bought a gun.‘
      7.    Wife:              Mmm. ¿Igi mani?                      ‗Hmm. How much?‘
      8.    Husband:           An wichul.                           ‗I don‘t know.‘
      9.    Wife:              ¿Pia pakcha?                         ‗Where did he buy it?‘
      10.   Husband:           Teal.                                ‗Downriver.‘
      11.   Wife:              Mmm.                                 ‗Hmm.‘4.2 Pronunciation
4.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2)
In section 3.2.3 the intonation pattern of questions requiring yes/no answers is discussed. Other types of
questions are discussed in this lesson (see 4.4.3 for grammatical explanations). Become familiar with the correct
intonation of questions by doing the following exercises.15
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1 by humming the intonation. Pay special attention to acknowledgement of the
answer to a question.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing
down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.","[44, 45, 46]"
"3.4 Grammar
3.4.1 Yes/No questions
As stated in 3.2.3.2, the order of words in a question requiring an eye ‗yes‘ or chuli ‗no‘ answer is the same as
the order of the words in a statement. In conversation, a question is distinguished from a statement by
intonation. In writing, a question is distinguished from a statement by punctuation (question marks).
Example         ¿Pe mas tune?                     ‗Are you going to cook?‘3.4.2 Verb tense aspect - immediate future (Ex. 12–16)
When an event is viewed by the speaker as being imminent (the action will undoubtedly take place), the
tense-aspect11 used is called the immediate future. In using the immediate future, keep two things in mind: the
immediate future suffix is added to the verb and a time reference must be either stated or implied.",[41]
"20.4.11.1 Alternatives in postpredicate position
A main sentence, either a statement or question, which gives rise to the alternatives is stated with the
probability/possibility suffix -dewa/-tewa attached to the verb. The two alternatives with the suffix
-dewa/-tewa ‗perhaps‘ attached to each one, are stated in the postpredicate position. When the alternative is
more remote the suffix -dowa/-towa is used.
Examples
    1. Antin wichul inkwa tanidewa; pandewa                     ‗I do not know when (he) is coming perhaps; perhaps
         (o)128 achuldewa.                                      tomorrow (or) perhaps the day after tomorrow.‘
127
    The suffix -dibe/-tibe ‗perhaps‘ is used rarely in the Paya Kuna dialect although it is common in the San Blas dialect. It
is limited to already hypothetical situations. For example, ¿Ibi an immal kaotibeye? ‗How could I perhaps catch
something?‘ (see #13 of Section 20.1).
128
    The Spanish o ‗or‘ has been borrowed into the language and is used often between alternatives.
284                                                                                                   Classifications      2.   An wichul; Pedro tanidowa (o) chuldowa.         ‗I don‘t know; Peter is coming perhaps or not
                                                           (perhaps)‘20.4.11.2 Chulil
The adverb chulil ‗if not‘ may be used to express an alternative. In this case, two sentences are used; the first
gives one alternative, the second begins with chulil and provides the other alternative.
Example
           Sagla pan noniko. Chulil, achul.                ‗The chief will arrive tomorrow. If not, then the day
                                                           after tomorrow.‘20.4.11.3 Alternative choice
When a speaker is deciding on a choice of two actions or people, the choice is indicated by two questions; the
first poses the choice involved with or without -dewa/-tewa, the second states the two alternatives each
accompanied by -dewa/-tewa ‗perhaps‘.
Examples
    1a. ¿Igi an chao?                                      ‗What shall I do?‘
    b. ¿An naodewa (o) chuldewa?                           ‗I should go perhaps or not perhaps?‘
    2a. ¿Toa an palmine(dewa)?                             ‗Whom should I send (perhaps)?‘
    b. ¿Pedrodewa (o) Pablodewa?                           ‗Peter perhaps or Paul perhaps?‘
    3a. ¿Mol igid an pako?                                 ‗What color (of) cloth will I buy?‘
    b. Antin mol kinnid paknedewa (o) mol                  ‗I will buy red cloth perhaps or yellow perhaps.‘
         kollogwaddewa.","[296, 297]"
"11.4.5.1 Yielding-the-floor questions
One of the most common signals and one which clearly signals that the floor is now free for another speaker, is
the use of a question.
One situation, however, in which a question does not indicate a yielding of the floor is the case of rhetorical
questions used for rebuke. The speaker does not want the listener to answer a rhetorical question. This type of
question is clearly marked by jaj which is added to the end of the question.
Example
Angry father to his son:
        ¿Pe es chapurbal ebes? ¿Jaj?           ‗You left the machete in the jungle, didn‘t you!‘
11.4 Grammar                                                                                                       13511.4.5.2 Yielding-the-floor expressionsa) Mmmm
Mmmm is said with a long drawn-out sound and a final low pitch which signals that the speaker has now
finished what he wants to say and the floor is open.b) Teobi
Teobi ‗that‘s all (thus only)‘ is used by the speaker at the end of an account of a trip or incident that has
happened. The expected response to teobi is Ajáj, Aaaa, or Mmmm.c) Teob ito
Teob ito ‗thus (it was), you understand‘ is a variation of teobi ‗that‘s all‘. The speaker says, ―This is the way it
was‖ to make sure the listener heard and understood his comments. The expected response to teob ito is Ajáj
and/or another yielding-the-floor expression.d) Teje
If the speaker views what he has told you as being selected from a larger corpus (body) of information, he will
often close with teje ‗thus far (to there)‘. The expected response would be ajáj, or another yielding-the-floor
expression.e) Ajáj
Ajáj ‗agreement‘ is often used to terminate an answer to a question, as though the speaker was saying, ―That‘s
my answer and I agree with it.‖ The expected response is ajáj or another yielding-the-floor expression.f) Pitogwa
Pitogwa ‗Listen/Heed!‘ is used at the end of a speech or exhortation. The expected response would be yerba
‗good‘ with a final quickly raised pitch which leaves the floor open.g) Pitomalgo
Pitomalgo ‗let‘s all listen to/heed (this)‘ is also used at the end of a speech, or exhortation. The expected
response to this is yerba ‗good‘ with a final quickly raised pitch which leaves the floor open.h) Pela
Pela ‗finished‘ is used to terminate a meeting, discussion, work party, etc. The expected response is ajáj or napíra.
Although there are other more complex endings, they usually contain at least one of the above.
Examples
Speaker:
      1. Teje unila an chogdo.                           ‗To here, is all I say.‘
      2. Egdin bal chummakedbal nikchul.                 ‗I have nothing further to say.‘
      3. Teob ito.                                       ‗That‘s it/thus it was, you hear/understand.‘
Listener:
      4. Ajáj. Mmmm.                                     ‗Oh! Mmmm. (floor is open for anyone to speak).‘11.4.6 Waiving the floor
Often a speaker is speaking to a group of people, but one of the people is the real object of his comments or the
listeners have a known order of rank which dictates who may take the floor first. If on the speaker‘s
yielding-the-floor, the main person spoken to or the status person wishes to leave the floor ―free,‖ he may do so
by using the the waiving-the-floor expression.

Yerba ‗good‘ is used to express approval of a formal speech, exhortation, etc., and is usually made by the
person of highest status in the group and chorused by the rest of the listeners.","[147, 148, 149]"

                                             ABSTRACT
The purpose of this grammar is to help any interested person learn to speak and understand Paya Kuna ,
which is spoken by the people of Paya, Pucuru, and Capetí in the Darién province of the Republic of Panama
and in the Kuna settlements of Arquía and Kudi on the Colombian side of the border. This volume deals with
some of the most basic characteristics of Kuna pronunciation and grammar, and it provides appendices on
various topics and a fairly extensive Paya Kuna vocabulary. Many important characteristics are not discussed
in this volume, but hopefully, after mastering these first twenty lessons the student will be equipped to
continue self-directed language learning. The grammar was designed primarily for use in a classroom where
the teacher is a native speaker of Kuna, but it also lends itself to learning Kuna in the informal situation of a
Paya Kuna village. Each section is not meant to be covered in a single class period, but normally consists of a
dialogue, pronunciation notes, notes on cultural etiquette, grammar aspects and exercises, and vocabulary
items for memorization. Emphasis is put on learning by mimicking in chorus and alone until the speech
patterns become automatic, thus, using a conversational approach to learning a language. An attempt is made
throughout to not only explain and drill the forms discussed, but also to enable language students to know in
which situational contexts their use is appropriate. An effort was also made to show the inseparability of the
Kuna language from its socio-cultural context.

                            THE PAYA KUNA ALPHABET
To simplify reference, Paya Kuna will be referred to as ―Kuna.‖ For pedagogical purposes some modifications
of the official Kuna alphabet have been employed in the spelling of Kuna words in the body of the text. In the
vocabulary in Volume 3, if the official spelling differs from the practical one adopted for this grammar, it is
given in square brackets.

                   1 BASIC GREETINGS AND TAKING LEAVE
1.1 Dialogue
When you first encounter a Kuna speaker, it is important to establish rapport. The first step is the use of
greetings and leave-takings appropriate to the occasion. One of the common formats for greeting and
leave-taking is given in this Dialogue.
Upon arrival:
        1.    Visitor:          Anná.1                              ‗Hello.‘
        2.    Villager:         Mai./Chi.                           ‗I‘m home (masculine)./I‘m home (feminine).‘ (see
                                                                    I.D.1.)
    3. Visitor:                 An pe taktani.                      ‗I‘ve come to see you.‘
    4. Villager:                Ajáj. Toge.                         ‗Come in.‘
    5. Visitor:                 Nabiri.                             ‗Okay.‘
    6. Villager:                Chigwe.                             ‗Sit down.‘
    7. Visitor:                 Nabiri.                             ‗Okay.‘
Upon departure:
        8.    Visitor:          Nade.                               ‗I‘m going.‘
        9.    Villager:         Eye.                                ‗Yes‘1.2 Pronunciation
1.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2)
In learning another language as an adult, you will have to break one set of habits and acquire a new set as
required by the new language. One of the first is intonation, the ―tune‖ of what is being said, since Kuna
intonation differs from that of English or Spanish. Learning the intonation patterns is very important to your
future control of the language. Learn them at the beginning so you do not have to unlearn wrong patterns later.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher (not another student) as he says Dialogue 1.1 by humming the intonation patterns (―tune‖).
Note: Humming the intonation patterns should be done before any attempt is made to master the individual
(segmental) sounds.
Attention should be paid to pitch, intensity, rhythm, etc. In short, mimic everything you can say with your
mouth still firmly shut! Further practice can be gained by mimicking the teacher under your breath, while he
is working with other students. Do not mimic other students.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 1.1. Pronounce the individual sounds as best you can without 1) slowing down
or, 2) losing the intonation pattern.
Note: If you have trouble with a particular sound, you should master the sound by using the drills designed
specifically for the sound, not by trying to master it in the dialogue.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"4.3 Culture
In Kuna, if someone answers a question you have asked, it is polite to acknowledge the answer before you ask
another question. Such expressions as ajáj, aaaa, eye ‗yes‘, are used to acknowledge the answer to a question
(see 11.4.3.1).
Most Kunas have a Spanish name and a Kuna name; they prefer to use their Spanish names with outsiders and
for doing business. If you are referring to a Kuna while you are in conversation with someone, or if you need to
attract the attention of a Kuna, it is more polite to refer to him by his role in society (e.g., sagla ‗chief‘) or by his
kinship to someone (e.g., Luis pab ‗Louis‘ father‘, Alvaro machi ‗Alvaro‘s son‘), than directly by name. It is
not polite to ask someone his Kuna name. Even if you know an individual‘s Kuna name, you should use his
Spanish name to refer to him. Only if/when in conversation with you, the Kuna people refer to someone by his
Kuna name, are you at liberty to use his Kuna name.",[50]
"3.4.2.2 Intonation pattern of answers
As you get into the Kuna language and people try to get to know you, you will find that your early
conversations are primarily question and answer interactions. Both the questions and the answers in Kuna have
specific intonation patterns. For the purpose of these lessons, consider the normal pitch to be that of a statement.
Exercise 4. Answer intonation drill
The teacher says Dialogue 3.1 and the student reads the dialogue, humming the intonation quietly as the teacher
reads aloud. Pay special attention to the intonation and pitch of the answers.",[38]
"11.4.8 Obligatory answers to questions and proposals
Kuna tends to be more explicit than English/Spanish. A real question must be answered or a proposal responded
to by the listener before he can pose a counter question or counter proposal. The listener, however, is allowed to
ask for further information or clarification before answering the main question or proposal.
Example
    1. Speaker A:               ¿Inkwa pe nao?         ‗When are you going?‘
    2. Speaker B:               ¿Piaje?                ‗(Going) where?‘
    3. Speaker A:               Negzhe.                ‗Home.‘
    4. Speaker B:               Pane.                  ‗Tomorrow.‘11.5 Vocabulary

                       12 EVENT TIME-COMMUNICATION
12.1 Dialogue
In almost every Kuna conversation, it is important to communicate the time at which events took place. Ways of
doing so are illustrated in This dialogue:
The men are in a town meeting discussing when to thatch a house. Pedro speaks:
     1. Nabirté.                                       ‗Well then.‘
     2. Immis an chowal amidi.                         ‗Today I looked for firewood.‘
     3. Pandin, an aros tigne.                         ‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to plant rice.‘
     4. Achuldin, an ua makne, nakwal.                 ‗The day after tomorrow, I‘m going to spear fish upriver.‘
     5. Ibapaje, anmal nabir neg makel.                ‗In three days‘ time we can thatch the house.‘
     6. Teob an chog.                                  ‗That‘s what I say.‘
Juan speaks:
     7.    Nabirté.                                    ‗Well now.‘
     8.    Immis an immal amidi.                       ‗Today I went hunting.‘
     9.    Wis mecha: koe walgwen, tegin chigli        ‗I killed something (a little): a deer and a wild turkey.‘
           kwagwendo.
     10. Pandin, an tagar chwane.                      ‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to collect wild banana leaves.‘
     11. Kukpo ampa napi, takcha.                      ‗I still lack two bundles, you see.‘
     12. Tummigwengus an yegus.                        ‗(This is because) a week ago I got sick.‘
     13. Immis kep wisgad.                             ‗Today I‘m feeling better for the first time.‘
     14. Ibapaje nabir neg makel.                      ‗It will be fine to thatch the house in three days‘ time.‘
     15. Itos. Ajáj.                                   ‗That‘s all.‘
The chief speaks (in summary):
      16. Itosmal.                                     ‗Listen, all of you.‘
      17. Ibapaje neg makne.                           ‗In three days‘ time we‘ll thatch the house.‘
All the men speak (in chorus):
     18.   Yerba.                                      ‗Fine.‘12.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–3)
The goals of this section are to master the intonation patterns of sentences which contrast with each other. For
example, in English a speaker may contrast events on two different days, ―Today I ... Tomorrow I ...‖ using a
changed intonation pattern to emphasize the contrast of activities. On the other hand, in Kuna the contrastive
suffix -din/-tin is used to contrast clauses, phrases, and words, and a characteristic intonation pattern
accompanies these utterances. These characteristic intonation patterns and change of pitch which occur with
-din/-tin are drilled in this section.
Exercise 1. Tracking the dialogue
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 12.1. Be sure to keep within two or three syllables behind him at all
times. Repeat this exercise several times.","[152, 153, 154]"
"13.4.2.1 Pronoun of noun referring to the possessor without possessive suffix
When possession is expressed by the name of the possessor, the possessor or a pronoun without a possessive
suffix, the possessed item follows.
Examples
    1. An achu neggin mai.                    ‗My dog is at home.‘
    2. Pab achu neggin mai.                   ‗Father’s dog is at home.‘
    3. Pedro achu neggin mai.                 ‗Peter’s dog is at home.‘
Exercise 3. Possessive substitution drill
The teacher says the sentence and selects a word from the list and says it. The student substitutes the selected
word in the frame.
Example        Teacher: An pega an mol ukcha.
               Teacher: nan
               Student: An pega nan mol ukcha.
      Frame    An pega ____ mol ukcha. ‗I gave you ____‘s clothes.‘
       1. an           ‗I/my‘
       2. pe           ‗you/your‘

      4. nan            ‗mother/mother‘s‘
      5. Pedro          ‗Peter/Peter‘s‘
      6. e              ‗his/her/its/their‘13.4.2.2 Possessive suffix -gad/-kad in an equative sentence
Possession in an equative sentence is expressed by saying the object possessed, followed by the noun or
pronoun that refers to the possessor to which the possessive suffix -gad/-kad is attached.
Examples
      1. Achu ankad.          ‗The dog is mine.‘
      2. Achu pabgad.         ‗The dog is father’s.‘
      3. Neg kallingad.       ‗The house is the chicken’s.‘
If ownership is being emphasized the long form of the suffix is used.
Example        Achu Pedrogadi.                   ‗The dog is Peter‘s.‘13.4.2.3 Possessive pronoun with a possessive suffix
A possessive phrase paralleling the English construction ―____ of mine/yours/his/its‖ can be formed by stating
the object possessed, followed by the noun or pronoun that refers to the possessor to which the possessive suffix
-gad/-kad is attached.64
Examples
    1. Es ankad neggin mai.                      ‗A machete of mine is in the house.‘
    2. An karta Pedrogad takcha.                 ‗I saw the book of Peter’s.‘13.4.2.4 Possessive questions
Questions of possession are formed by adding the possessive suffix -gad/-kad to a question word.
Examples
    1. ¿Toagad?                   ‗Whose (is it)?‘
    2. ¿Ibigad?                   ‗To what (does it belong?‘13.4.2.5 Extended use of -gad/-kad
-gad/-kad is used in the sense of ‗made of some type of material‘.
Examples
    1. chowalgad                  ‗wooden‘
    2. ezhagad                    ‗made of iron‘
Exercise 4. -gadi/-kadi drill
The teacher asks the question and the student answers the question, selecting an answer from the list below.
Example      Teacher: ¿Achude, toagadi?
             Student: Angadi.
         Answers
      1. an          ‗I‘
      2. mu          ‗older respected lady‘
64
  The variation in word order in which the possessive -gad/-kad form precedes the noun indicates that the focus is on the
possessive word. For example, Ankad ul cheles. ‗(It was) my canoe that was washed away.‘ but Ul ankad cheles. ‗My
canoe was washed away.‘

         5. ¿Toagad esmed, itide?          ‗Whose pot is this?‘13.4.3 Concept of pluralization (Ex. 6–18)
In Kuna, there is not necessarily anything in a noun or in most verbs which would tell you whether it is singular
or plural. Generally speaking, you understand that a noun/verb is singular or plural from the context of the
sentence or from the situation.
In the case of nouns, however, there are two suffixes, -gan(a)/-kan(a) and -mal(a), which are added in certain
situations to indicate that the speaker is referring to more than one individual.
Positional verbs have a plural form and the suffix -mal(a) may be added to a verb to indicate that ―everyone‖ is
included in an action.","[173, 174, 175]"

  Here and throughout this grammar, where no subject is overtly indicated by a noun or pronoun, an appropriate pronoun is
supplied. In another context, it might be a different one.

     9. pak          ‗to buy‘
    10. tig          ‗to plant‘4.4.3.2 Topic-establishing questions
The topic of a question is the person or thing to whom/which the question refers. It is very important in Kuna
that the topic of a question be clear. If the person or thing to whom/which the question refers is not presently
being talked about, or if the topic is not obvious, it must be stated before the question itself. If the topic of a
question is obscure and it is not stated, the listener may not understand the question.
For example, if you suddenly ask, ―Where is he going?,‖ your listener will invariably reply, ―Where is who
going?‖ By asking this question, the listener has tried to establish the topic of your question. In other words, the
topic of the question was unclear. Once the listener has understood the topic, he will answer the question. Three
things must be kept in mind in using topic-establishing questions: the intonation pattern of the question, the
order of the sentence, and the form of the topic.","[53, 54]"
"1) Forms of the basic negative word chuli „no‟
        When used alone, the basic negative word chuli ‗no‘ may occur in one of three forms:a) Chul ‗no‘
     Chul ‗no‘ is the most common form of the basic negative word. It is used in response to a question which
     requires a negative answer. In other words, it is used to deny that the action in the question is going to take
     place.

     -chul follows fortis consonants, -zhul follows lenis consonants, and -jul follows vowels.

    1. ¿Pe ne?                     ‗Are you going?‘
    2. Chul.                       ‗No.‘b) Chuli ‗no‘
     Chuli ‗no‘ is a more emphatic form of the basic negative word and is used as a more emphatic denial in
     response to the same situations for which you would reply with chul ‗no‘.
Examples
    1. ¿Pedro Pucurche ne?                         ‗Is Peter going to Pucuro?‘
    2. ¡Chuli!                                     ‗No!‘c) Chula ‗no‘
     Chula ‗no‘ is a very rare form of the basic negative word. It is used in reference to an action of the past
     and parallels the English construction, ―never, not a chance.‖ It is often used as a response to consistent
     teasing or persistent accusation and gives the response the flavor of ―not only is that not true, it never was
     true either!‖
Examples
    1. ¡An akande, pedin tar chus!                 ‗You took my axe!‘
    2. ¡Chula!                                     ‗No (I did nothing of the kind)!‘2) Basic negative word used in a sentence
      Any form of the basic negative word chul/chuli/chula ‗no‘ may be used in a sentence to deny that an
      adverb or adjective used in the/a previous sentence is valid. In this construction, the sentence is reiterated.
      The subject must be emphasized by the addition of the topic marking suffix -din/-tin or by the use of the
      demonstrative adjective we ‗that‘. A form of the word chul/chuli/chula is used at the end of the sentence
      to negate the adjective/adverb.
Examples
    1. Uade, totó.                                 ‗The fish is small.‘
    2. Uadin, toto chul.95                         ‗The fish is not small.‘
       or
       We ua, toto chul.                           ‗That fish is not small.‘
Exercise 22. Chul ‗no‘ denial stimulus-response drill
The teacher selects a sentence and says it. The student replies denying the statement.
Examples       Teacher: Uade, totó.
               Student: Uadin, toto chul.
       1. Uade, totó.         ‗That fish is small.‘
       2. Molde, muis.        ‗That cloth is cheap.‘
       3. Manide, unni.       ‗That money is enough.‘
       4. Akande, nued.       ‗That axe is good.‘
       5. Ulde, tummad.       ‗That canoe is big.‘15.4.2.2 Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i)
The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhuli/-jul(i) may be added to certain words in order to negate the word itself
or it may be used to negate an entire sentence.","[217, 218]"
"3.2.5 Pronunciation of monosyllabic words (Ex. 11)
Monosyllabic words are words which have only one syllable. Kuna words which are made up of only one vowel
and one consonant, or of only one vowel are pronounced by lengthening the vowel. When such monosyllabic
words are said in isolation or at the end of a sentence, the tone slides down (down glides).
Examples
    1. ti             ‗water‘
    2. an             ‗branch‘
    3. u              ‗nest‘
Exercise 11. Pronunciation of monosyllabic words
The teacher says a word from the list below, and the student repeats the word after the teacher, mimicking as
closely as possible the down glide in these monosyllabic words.
Example    Teacher: ti
           Student: ti
     1. ti         ‗water‘
     2. no         ‗frog‘
     3. ka         ‗hot peppers‘
     4. pe         ‗you‘
     5. ku         ‗louse‘
     6. ma         ‗to peck‘
     7. ne         ‗Go!‘
     8. ni         ‗moon‘
     9. po         ‗to cry‘
    10. tu         ‗(species of) armadillo‘
    11. a          ‗that‘
    12. e          ‗his/her/its‘
    13. u          ‗nest‘3.3 Culture
When people first meet, there is usually an exchange of questions which helps the people become acquainted.
Cultures differ as to the questions which may be politely asked in such a situation.
Questions about where you have come from and where you are going are quite acceptable in Kuna. The
question, ―When are you leaving?‖ is also often asked. That question does not have the same negative
connotation it does in English, but rather implies the idea of, ―How long are you staying?‖ Questions
concerning your parents, brothers and sisters, and wife/husband and children are bound to follow.
28                                                                                                  Conversational RepliesIn Kuna, it is quite acceptable to ask the price of items bought. If the item was a gift there is no need to disclose
the value.
Great care should be taken when inquiring about the success of a hunting or fishing trip. Direct questions
concerning the kill or the catch may be interpreted as a request/demand to share in the proceeds. It is much
more acceptable to ask what happened on the trip than to ask what was killed or caught.","[40, 41]"
"1) Intonation of a topic-establishing question
     Topic-establishing questions have a characteristic intonation pattern. Do the following exercise to
     familiarize yourself with this pattern.

    2. ¿Punu, pia chi?          ‗Daughter, where is she?‘ or ‗Where is (my) daughter?‘3) Form of the topic
     Many nouns have long and short forms (see 3.4.4. and Appendix A). One of the times the long forms is
     used is in establishing the topic of a question.
Examples
     1. mol becomes mola                 ‗cloth/blouse‘
     2. pab becomes paba                 ‗father‘
    You must memorize the nouns which have two forms and the ones which do not. Some hints which will
    help you learn some nouns which do not have short forms are:
    1. A noun is almost never shortened if the short form would introduce ambiguity.
    2. Nouns which have a consonant cluster (two consonants together) before the final vowel, cannot be
        shortened.

Structurally, confirmation questions are the same as the amplificatory questions. However, their purpose is
different. A confirmation question acknowledges that the narrator has already given the information asked for
by the listener. The listener has missed the information for some reason or another, so he asks for a repeat. The
confirmation question is signalled by a distinctive intonation pattern. The question basically says: ―I know you
already said this, but would you please say it again?‖ Do the following exercise to familiarize yourself with the
intonation pattern.
Exercise 18. Confirmation question drill
The teacher says Sentence 1a and then leads the class in asking the confirmation question 1b. The class repeats
the question after the teacher, being careful to mimic the intonation pattern. The teacher then replies to the
question by repeating Sentence 1a. Continue to practice the intonation pattern of confirmation questions by
doing the following dialogue-type exercises.
Example       Teacher (speaking as narrator):                                            Tule ogob pakcha.
              Teacher (leading the class as listener):                                   ¿Ibi pakcha?
              Student (mimicking the teacher as listener):                               ¿Ibi pakcha?
              Teacher (speaking as narrator, in answer to confirmation question):        Tule ogob pakcha.

5.1 Dialogue
Trade often brings people of different languages and cultures together. The following dialogue is typical in such
situations.
A villager comes up to a trader selling goods:
     1.    Villager:    ¿Igi kude?                           ‗How are you?‘
     2.    Trader:      Nued. ¿Pedin?                        ‗Fine, and you?‘
     3.    Villager:    Ampala. ¿Ibi nika (uked)?            ‗So-so. What do you have to sell?‘
     4.    Trader:      Mola, ezha, palu; tegine             ‗Cloth, machetes, salt and kerosene.‘
                        akwati.
    5.   Villager:      ¿Igi mani?                           ‗How much?‘
    6.   Trader:        ¿Piti?                               ‗Which?‘
    7.   Villager:      Esdina.                              ‗The machetes.‘
    8.   Trader:        Karta kabo.                          ‗Two dollars.‘

    10. Trader:         Manigwen.                            ‗One real (nickel).‘
    11. Villager:       Ajáj. An akwati pei.                 ‗Okay. I want kerosene. A gallon (costs) $.75,
                        Galongwen, tongwen eg                doesn‘t it?‘
                        maniatal, jaj?
    12. Trader:         Eye.                                 ‗Yes (that‘s right).‘

     18.   Trader:          Eye.                             ‗Good-bye.‘5.2 Pronunciation and Intonation (Ex. 1–4)
5.2.1 Conversation
Increase your ability to control the intonation patterns of Kuna conversation by doing the following drills.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 5.1 by humming the intonation. Pay special attention to the intonation
differences between questions and answers.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 5.1 doing your best to formulate individual sounds 1) without slowing down, or
2) without losing the intonation pattern.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"
"1) Emphasis
    The main use of the long form is for emphasis in various situations. In the case of a suffixed word, the
    long form of the final suffix is used.
Examples
    1. Nana.                       ‗MOTHER‘
    2. ¡Tummagana!                 ‗The chiefs!‘2) Topic establishing
     The long form of a word is used to establish the topic of a question or statement.
Examples
    1. ¿Paba, pia nad?             ‗Where did father go?‘
    2. Antina, an132 ne.           ‗I am going.‘3) Emphatic answers
    Emphatic, single word answers to questions occur in the long form.
Examples
    1. ¿Toa koe makcha?                            ‗Who shot the deer?‘
       Anni.                                       ‗I did.‘
    2. ¿Pedin machi takcha?                        ‗Did you see the boy?‘
       ¡Chuli!                                     ‗No!‘4) Attribute of attributive or equative sentence
     If the attribute of an attributive or equative sentence is emphasized, the long form is used (see 9.4.4).
Examples
    1.                                             Ul tummadi.             ‗The canoe is big.‘
    2. (People looking at photographs):            Wedin paba.             ‗That‘s Father.‘5) Vocative
     The emphatic, long form of the vocative is used when the person is at a distance, or when the speaker is
     exasperated.
Examples
    1. ¡Nana!            ‗Mo-o-other!‘
    2. ¡Punu!            ‗Dau-au-aughter!‘6) Clarification
     The long form of a word is used to clarify a situation and to prevent ambiguity concerning which item is
     under discussion (see 17.4.2.3).",[303]
"6.4.2.1 General use of the present progressive
In general, the positional verb used to form the present progressive reflects the position of the person/thing
doing the action.
Examples
       1a. Mimmi kammai.24                     ‗The baby is (lying) sleeping.‘
        b. Mimmi kabzhi.                       ‗The baby is (sitting in a chair) sleeping.‘
                         25
        c. Wag kabgwis.                        ‗The outsider is (standing/leaning against something) sleeping.‘
       2a. An mas kunchi.                      ‗I am (sitting) eating.‘
        b. An mas kunkwis.5                    ‗I am (standing) eating.‘
        3. Kukualed kukunai.                   ‗The plane is (suspended) flying.‘
It is important to note that the present progressive suffix -chi, changes its form according to the final vowel or
consonant of the verb stem:
         -chi occurs following fortis consonants.
         -chi becomes -zhi following lenis consonants.
         -chi becomes -ji following vowels.24
     b becomes m before m or n. For example, kab + -mai = kammai ‗is sleeping‘.
25
     -gwis and -kwis are short forms of kwichi ‗to be standing‘.
64                                                                                                     Positional WordsExamples
    1. An mas kunchi.                              ‗I am (sitting) eating.‘
    2. An madun kobzhi.                            ‗I am (sitting) drinking.‘
    3. An mas tuji.                                ‗I am (sitting) cooking.‘6.4.2.2 Active/passive involvement in present progressive tense
A Kuna speaker often makes a distinction between a person actively engaging in an action, versus someone who
is passively involved in an action. If the speaker is focusing on the idea that the person is actively or passively
involved in an action, rather than on the action itself, the positional verbs nai and chi are used as present
progressive suffixes. The suffix -nai ‗hanging/suspended‘ is used to indicate that a person is actively involved
in an action. The actor may be standing, sitting or lying, but he is actively involved.
Examples
       1. An mol maknai.                         ‗I am actively (sitting) sewing a blouse.‘
       2. Machi karro nudanai.                   ‗The boy is actively (lying down underneath) fixing a car.‘
The present progressive tense suffix -chi is used if an actor is passively involved in an action, regardless of a
standing, sitting, or lying position. If, for example, a woman is standing passively watching food cook, but is
not stirring it, or doing anything to the fire, a Kuna speaker would use the present progressive suffix
-chi/-zhi/-ji. Or, if a man is lying under a car, passively looking at it, but he is not actively involved in doing
anything, the present progressive suffix -chi/-zhi/-ji could be used.
Examples
    1. Ome mas tuji.                 ‗The woman is passively (possibly standing) cooking food.‘
    2. Tule karro takchi.            ‗The man is passively (possibly lying underneath) looking at a car.‘
    3. An aros takchi.               ‗I am passively (possibly standing) looking at the rice.‘6.4.2.3 Temporary action sense of -gwis/-kwis
The temporary nature of an action in progress can be indicated by using -gwis/-kwis in a secondary sense. In
this case the suffix -gwis/-kwis26 is added to the short form of the verb stem.
Examples
    1. An nuskan takkwis.                          ‗I am looking after the children for the moment.‘
    2. An itigin meggwis.                          ‗I am living here temporarily.‘
Exercise 6. Present progressive aspect frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example         Teacher: An ua kunnai.
                Student: An ua kunnai.
         1. An ua kunnai.                          ‗I‘m eating fish.‘
         2. An ua maknai.                          ‗I‘m spearing fish.‘
         3. An ua chwanai.                         ‗I‘m catching fish.‘
         4. An karta takchi.                       ‗I‘m just sitting looking at/reading a letter.‘
         5. An karta nermaji.                      ‗I‘m just sitting writing a letter.‘
         6. Machi kammai.                          ‗The boy lies sleeping.‘
         7. Machi atamai.                          ‗The boy lies awake.‘
         8. Machi ullukumai.                       ‗The boy lies resting.‘26
     purkwis ‗died‘ and nakwis ‗to ascend/go up‘ are not derived in this way.

      8. echu          ‗to take off‘6.4.3 Disclaimer (nothing-special-is-happening) response (Ex. 10)
It is very common that on a chance meeting or casual visit a Kuna will ask the person he sees a general question
such as, ‗What are you doing?‘, ‗Where have you been?‘, or ‗What are you going to do?‘. The response is often a
nothing-much type of an answer, a disclaimer response. The disclaimer response states what the person is doing or
where he is going in a manner that suggests that the activity is routine, nothing special. Pinche ‗for nothing/for no
special purpose‘ is an optional feature of a disclaimer response. It serves to heighten the disclaimer.
Exercise 10. Disclaimer response drill

  -o is used to refer to an action to be performed in the future. This suffix is discussed further in 10.4. -bal is used to
indicate repetition of an action, e.g., tanibal ‗come again‘. This suffix is also discussed further in 10.4.3.1.

7.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1)
Exercise 1. Intonation pattern drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 7.1 by humming the intonation patterns. Think the words as you hum them. Pay
special attention to the intonation change between questions and answers.","[76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81]"
"         Setting
        When you wish to orient your listener as to ―when‖ an event took place or will take place, the time
        expression occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Example          Sae an karpa chobzha.           ‗Yesterday I made a basket.‘          Connectives
        If you choose to organize your story chronologically, thus, developing the story around the time certain
        events happened/will happen, time expressions become the ―glue‖ that holds the story together. The time
        expression is the connective which joins one thought or sentence to the former one. If the time expression
        is a connective, it occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Example
             Martesgin59 anmal noni. Pangin anmal            ‗Tuesday we arrived. The next day we went hunting
             immal aminade.                                  (animals).‘
58
     b becomes m before n, for example: chob + -ne = chomne ‗going to make‘.

     Days of the week are Spanish loan words. Tummi ‗Sunday‘ is a Kuna term whose primary meaning is ‗week‘.
12.4 Grammar                                                                                                      147      Answers to questions
     Time expressions used to answer time-related questions such as: ¿Inkwa? ‗When?‘ occur at the beginning
     of the sentence.
Examples
    1. ¿Inkwa pe ne?            ‗When are you going?‘
    2. Pan an ne.               ‗I am going tomorrow.‘      Topic
     When the time expression is the topic of the conversation, it occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Examples
    1. Pan an ne.                                         ‗Tomorrow I am going (referring to what the person
                                                          plans to do tomorrow).‘
     2.    Ai yegualil an ina che.                        ‗When a friend becomes sick, I give him his
                                                          medicine.‘      Contrast of time of distinct events
     Occasionally, a situation arises in that an event that happened (will happen) in one time period is
     contrasted with what happened (will happen) in another time period. When the time of distinct events are
     contrasted, the time expressions occur at the beginning of the two sentences describing the events.
Example
          Pandin an aros tigne. Achuldin an ua            ‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to plant rice. The day after
          makne.                                          tomorrow (on the other hand), I‘m going to spear
                                                          fish.‘b) Time expressions used after the subject
     If a time expression is used as an adverb to limit the scope of the action by stating when it took place (or
     will take place), the time expression occurs after the subject of the sentence. This parallels the time
     expression occurring after the verb in English, ―I will go at 3 o‘clock.‖
Example       Antin pan ne.                 ‗I am going tomorrow.‘
    If there is more than one adverbial expression occurring after the subject, the time expression occurs
    immediately following the subject. This word order is different from English word order.
Example       Antin pan negzhe ne.            ‗I am going home tomorrow.‘
Exercise 10. Time frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: An pan negzhe ne.
              Student: An pan negzhe ne.
     1.    An pan negzhe ne.                              ‗I am going home tomorrow.‘
     2.    An sae akan pakcha.                            ‗I bought an axe yesterday.‘
     3.    Sagla immis noni.                              ‗The chief arrived today/just now.‘
     4.    An achul ob tigne.                             ‗I am going to plant corn day after tomorrow.‘
     5.    Machi asto kueye- kueye koe mecha.             ‗The boy quickly killed the deer the day before
                                                          yesterday.‘Exercise 11. Time expression substitution drill
The teacher says the frame and selects a time expression. The student then inserts the time expression in the
correct form of the frame.

       2. asto                 ‗day before yesterday‘

       7. immis                ‗now (referring to past or future)‘c) Time expressions at the end of a sentence
     Occasionally a time expression occurs at the end of a sentence in the postpredicate position (see 17.4) The
     time expression in this position is being emphasized by the speaker.
Example
       Machi nakwal ua makne, pane.                          ‗The boy is going to spear fish upriver tomorrow.‘12.4.1.2 Relating an event to another event (Ex. 12–26)
As indicated (see 7.4.1.4), the time of an event may be referred to by an exact time, for example, wachilbo ‗two
o‘clock‘. It may also be referred to by using an adverb of time, sae ‗yesterday‘, or a complex time word
ibabakegus ‗four days ago‘ (see 7.4.1.4). Another way of referring to the time of an event (Event A) is by
referring to the time of another event (Event B), that is known to the listener. That other event (Event B), may
be referred to by use of a time-reference suffix or time conjunction, or by means of prior condition suffixes.","[159, 160, 161]"

  This construction is the negation of the adjective and does not carry the antithetic connotation of the suffixed word (see
9.4.2.3).

      As discussed in Section 9.4.2, the negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) may be used to negate specific
      words such as adjectives or adverbs. The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is added to an
      adjective to give a negative answer to a question, to intensify antithesis or to provide an antonym for an
      adjective which does not have an antonym.
Examples
    1. totojuli                      ‗not small (emphatic: large)‘
    2. kakpijuli                     ‗not at all bitter (sweet)‘
    3. tikalbal                      ‗nearby‘
       becomes
       tikajul                       ‗not near (far)‘2) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a sentence
      A Kuna sentence is negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) ‗no‘ to the verb.96
      The long form has a more emphatic connotation than the short. The suffix is attached to the verb stem or
      immediately following the aspect suffix, for example, the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi (see 2.4.2.1).
Examples
    1. An immal pakchul.                                       ‗I did not buy a thing.‘
    2. An mol peichuli.97                                      ‗I do not want cloth.‘
    3. An mol peichul.                                         ‗I do not want cloth.‘
    4. An nan takchajul.                                       ‗I did not see Mother.‘
    5. Anmal yannu gwen takchajulmal.                          ‗We did not see a single peccary.‘
    6. An nebijul.                                             ‗I don’t want to go.‘
Exercise 23. -chul/-zhul/-jul negation of sentence frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise is repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: An nejul.
               Student: An nejul.
       1. An nejul.                                  ‗I am not going to go.‘
       2. An mas kuchajul.                           ‗I didn‘t eat (any) food.‘
       3. An mol pakchajul.                          ‗I didn‘t buy cloth.‘
       4. An tub peichul.                            ‗I don‘t want thread.‘
       5. An nebijul.                                ‗I don‘t want to go.‘
Exercise 24. -chul/-zhul/-jul negation of sentence stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a sentence from those listed below. The student responds by giving the negative form of the
sentence.
Example        Teacher: An ne.
               Student: An nejul.
       1. An ne.                                     ‗I‘m going to go.‘
       2. Machi ua chwas.                            ‗The boy caught a fish.‘
       3. Tad es pakpi.                              ‗The elder wants to buy a machete.‘
96
   After the dipthongs ai, ei, and oi, -chul(i) occurs rather than -jul(i). In fact, the -ch form of any suffix having an alternate
beginning in ch would occur after these diphthongs.
97
   The verb stem pei ‗to want to have (something)‘ expresses a desiderative state (see 2.4.2.2).

"3.2.2 Pronunciation of consonant cluster with lenis consonant g or fortis consonant k before
nasals m and n (Ex. 3)
The nasals m and n following a lenis consonant g do not change the quality of the g, The g is still said in a
relaxed, soft manner and the preceding vowel is lengthened.
Examples           chig + -ne = chigne                ‗going to sit‘
                   tig + -mal = tigmal                ‗(they) plant‘10
     oi is pronounced like oy in ‗boy‘ in English or like ‗hoy‘ ‗today‘ in Spanish. Igi ‗how‘ is contracted to ig in this greeting.

sound but is pronounced as a hard g sound. The hard g sound is used in the English word ‗bigness‘ and in the
Spanish word gorra ‗cap‘. In the case of a consonant cluster of k before nasals m and n, the vowel preceding
the cluster is short. In this way the identity of the fortis k is clarified.
Examples       chik + -ne = chikne             ‗going to cut‘
               pak + -mal = pakmal             ‗(they) buy‘
Exercise 3. Pronunciation of consonant cluster lenis g or fortis k and nasals m or n
The teacher reads through the list of words aloud while the student reads the words silently. The teacher reads
each word and the student mimics the teacher, being careful to pronounce as closely as possible the lenis g and
fortis k before the nasals m and n.
Example       Teacher: chikne
              Student: chikne
      1. chikne              ‗going to cut‘

It is helpful to divide the motion involved in a roundtrip journey into stages or phases:
Phase 1 - departure from a point of origin
Phase 2 - movement from point of origin towards a destination
Phase 3 - arrival at the destination or a major intermediate point
Phase 4 - leaving on the return journey
Phase 5 - returning from the destination
Phase 6 - arriving back at the original point of departure.
These phases of motion are referred to as the scope of movement. The narration of every journey involves some
or all of these phases, sometimes various activities are related, also which tools place during a phase, especially
phase 2 and phase 5, are at the destination before starting the return journey.
Languages differ in the phases of motion included in each motion verb, i.e., in the scope of movement
encompassed by certain verbs.
Verbs whose scope of movement includes only Phases 1 through 3 or Phases 4 through 6 are called
uni-directional verbs. Verbs whose scope includes Phases 1 through 6 are called bi-directional. Some motion
verbs, termed nondirectional, do not indicate a direction of motion.","[230, 231, 232, 233]"
"4.4.3.1 Amplificatory questions
Amplificatory questions are asked about a topic that may be already under discussion, or so obvious that it
requires no introduction. Most of the time, more information is being sought about the action referred to in the
discussion at hand. For example, the questioner may want to know who did the action, or when the action
happened. In dealing with amplificatory questions, two things must be remembered: the intonation pattern of
the question and the formation of the question.",[52]
"5. Summary information
A summary statement of some sort is then needed to summarize and warn the listener that the introduction is
finished and that the story proper is about to begin.
Example
Immal noni. Chule noni; taikcha. Chule, yer tunku. Chule nabir kunned. Ad noni.
Topical information
      1. Immal noni.                        ‗An animal arrived.‘
Identificational information
      2. Chule noni, takcha.                ‗It was a capybara, you see.‘

                    APPENDIX N: LANGUAGE LEARNING
A. Learning Outside the Classroom
The lessons in this grammar were designed mainly for classroom use. For the student who is learning the
language living among the people, or for those who wish extra or further study of the language, the questions
arise:
1. ―How do I learn outside of the classroom?‖
2. ―How do I go beyond the information in these lessons?‖ (The learner will inevitably find that he wants to
   know much more on some topics.)
This appendix is an attempt to answer these questions.","[316, 317, 318, 319, 320]"
"8.3     Culture
You already know how important it is to exchange greetings when you encounter a Kuna in or around the
village. Failure to greet people you pass in a Kuna village in the Darién indicates lack of acceptance or
displeasure.
You will certainly experience times, however, when you will want to do more than just greet the person.
Perhaps you will wish to establish an acquaintance or start a conversation. In such situations the use of
questions is very helpful. Questions concerning the person‘s family (Are you married? Do you have
brothers/sisters? Do you have children?) are acceptable. Questions concerning birthplace, what he is doing,
where he is going or where he lives are also acceptable and are very good conversation openers.
You must be careful to avoid certain areas of conversation which a person would find threatening to his people
or himself. For instance, detailed questioning about tribal ceremonies and customs should be withheld until you
are sure you have established mutual respect with the person.",[100]
"1) Intonation pattern of amplificatory questions
     Amplificatory questions have a characteristic intonation pattern. Do the following exercise to familiarize
     yourself with this pattern.
Exercise 11. Intonation of amplificatory questions drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc.
This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: ¿Pia ne?
              Student: ¿Pia ne?
40                                                                                                             Questions      1. ¿Pia ne?                 ‗Where are/is (you/he) going?‘
      2. ¿Ibi chobzha?            ‗What did (you/he) make?‘
      3. ¿Igi choge?              ‗What (how) do/does (you/he) say?‘
      4. ¿Toa noni?               ‗Who arrived?‘
      5. ¿Inkwa noni?             ‗When did (you/he) arrive?‘2) Form of amplificatory questions
     To form an amplificatory question, the appropriate question word is used and the verb about which more
     information is wanted is repeated. The subject is usually omitted.
Exercise 12. Amplificatory questions frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc.
This exercise should be repeated several times.
Examples       Teacher: ¿Toa chikcha?
               Student: ¿Toa chikcha?
               Teacher: ¿Ibi chikcha?
               Student: ¿Ibi chikcha?
      1. ¿Toa chikcha?                          ‗Who cut (it)?‘
      2. ¿Ibi chikcha?                          ‗What did (he) cut?‘17
      3. ¿Inkwa chikcha?                        ‗When did (he) cut (it)?‘
      4. ¿Pia chikcha?                          ‗Where did (he) cut (it)?‘
      5. ¿Igi chikcha?                          ‗How did (he) cut (it)?‘
Exercise 13. Amplificatory questions substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame and selects a word from the list below, which can be substituted in the frame, and
says it. The student then substitutes the word in the correct place in the frame.
Examples     Teacher: ¿Toa makcha?
             Teacher: ibi
             Student: ¿Ibi makcha?
             Teacher: ¿Ibi makcha?
             Teacher: inkwa
             Student: ¿Inkwa makcha?
     Frame ¿____ makcha?                        ‗____ did (she) sew (it)?‘
      1. pia         ‗Where?‘
      2. inkwa       ‗When?‘
      3. ibi         ‗What?‘
      4. igi         ‗How?‘
      5. toa         ‗Who?‘
Exercise 14. Amplificatory questions, varied substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame and selects a word from the list below which can be substituted in the frame and
says it. The student then substitutes the word in the correct place in the frame.","[52, 53]"
"1) Verb form of a very polite command
      A very polite command may be formed in one of three ways:
      a) Insert the suffix -gwel/-kwel between the verb stem and the future aspect suffix -o of the polite
      command form. No subject is used. In the case of the verb ne ‗to go‘, the request command form is
      negwelo, that is to say, the polite command form of the verb, nao, is not used in this construction.
Examples
     1. An pentakkwelo.                      ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘
     2. Anche taggwelo.                      ‗I would like you to be so kind as to come to me.‘
    b) Use the future aspect form of the verb preceded by the word wis ‗a little‘. In this case (as in future
    statements), the subject is included. The intonation pattern of a command is used.
Example      Pe wis an pentako.              ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘
    c) Use both the word wis ‗a little‘ and the suffix -gwel/-kwel with the future aspect of the verb. That is to
    say, wis precedes the verb and the suffix -gwel/-kwel is inserted before the future aspect suffix -o in the
    verb. The subject is included.
Example        Pe wis an pentakkwelo.         ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘2) Additional information stated in the request
      As stated above, a subject must be used when the word wis ‗a little‘ is used in the request command. The
      subject precedes wis and the rest of the very polite command follows normal word order. Wis can be
      repeated before the verb to make the request very polite: vocative + subject + wis + indirect object + direct
      object + verb ( + -gwel/-kwel) ( + -o).
Example
           Pedro, pe wis anka ina (wis) ukkwelo.           ‗Peter, I would like it if you would give me the medicine.‘3) Questioning request
      When the speaker is not sure whether or not the listener can meet a request, he uses a questioning request.
      This construction is formed by using the word wis ‗a little‘ with the suffix -ji following the future suffix.
      A question intonation pattern is used (see 3.2.3). The use of -ji expects a positive (yes) answer.
Example        ¿An wis pentakoji?             ‗Would you be so kind as to help me?‘
Exercise 12. wis very polite command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: Pedro, pe wis an pentako.
               Student: Pedro, pe wis an pentako.
      1. Pedro, pe wis an pentako.         ‗Peter, I would like you to please help me.‘
      2. Nestor, pe wis negzhe nao.        ‗Nestor, I would like you to please go home.‘
      3. Amma, pe wis nanbak nao.          ‗Aunt, I would like you to please go with Mother.‘
      4. Luis, pe wis anche tago.          ‗Louis, I would like you to please come to me.‘
      5. María, pe wis anka tub uko.       ‗Mary, I would like you to please give me some thread.‘

      1. Pedro, an pentakkwelo.           ‗Peter, I would like you to please help me.‘
      2. Nestor, negzhe negwelo.          ‗Nestor, I would like you to please go home.‘
      3. Amma, nanbak negwelo.            ‗Aunt, I would like you to please go with Mother.‘
      4. Luis, anche taggwelo.            ‗Louis, I would like you to please come to me.‘
      5. María, anka tub ukgwelo.         ‗Mary, I would like you to please give me some thread.‘
Exercise 14. wis and -gwel/-kwel request frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: Pedro, pe wis an pentakkwelo.
               Student: Pedro, pe wis an pentakkwelo.
      1. Pedro, pe wis an pentakkwelo.             ‗Peter, I would like you to please help me.‘
      2. Nestor, pe wis negzhe negwelo.            ‗Nestor, I would like you to please go home.‘

command form of the verb tag ‗to come‘.
Example      Teacher: You want a child some distance away to come.
             Student: ¡Tage!
      1. You want a child some distance away to come.
      2. You want the chief to come over to you.
      3. You want a friend to come.
      4. You want someone to come urgently.
      5. You want to coax a reluctant friend to come.","[213, 214]"
"15.4.2.1 Basic negative word chuli „no‟
The basic negative word chuli/chul ‗no‘ may be used alone as a negative exclamation, or it may be used within
a sentence. Chuli/chul ‗no‘ is used to respond negatively to a question asked, or a statement made to negate a
fact or action mentioned in the/a previous sentence, or to negate a certain adverb or adjective used in a/the
previous sentence.",[217]
"11.4.3.5 Question words used as conversation sustainers
Question words, such as toa ‗Who?‘, ibi ‗What?‘, inkwa ‗When?‘, igi ‗How?‘ , and pia ‗Where?‘ are
interjected at various points in the speaker‘s conversation to show interest and to encourage the speaker to go
into more detail.

Often a listener will echo a confirmation question back at the speaker. Confirmation questions are a useful
sustainer when the speaker is indulging in graphic descriptions. These are discussed in Section 4.4.3.3.","[146, 147]"
"9.4.3.4 Equivalent color suffix
Many colors do not fit easily into the two-way system of color distinctions: spectral and shades of intensity.
Kunas refer to colors which are similar to their view of a ―pure‖ color, or like another familiar object, or in the
general area of a shade of intensity by using an equivalent suffix attached to the color term. Equivalent suffixes
include:
          -gid(i)/-kid(i)       ‗the kind of‘
          -gwad(i)/-kwad(i) ‗has the quality/characteristic of‘
          -tiki/-diki39‗on the side of/leans toward‘
          -jaled(i)/-chaled(i)/-zhaled(i) ‗at the point of becoming‘
          -yob(i)     ‗like‘
          -ged(i)/-ked(i)       ‗being ____‘
    -takleged(i)/-dageleged(i)*           ‗____ looking‘
Examples
    1. pukwagid                                     ‗a kind of ñampi (purple)‘
    2. kinnigwad                                    ‗has the quality of red‘
    3. arraddiki                                    ‗on the side of a blue (color)‘
    4. kollodikigwad*                               ‗leaning toward the characteristic of yellow‘
    5. chibujaled                                   ‗at the point of becoming white‘

In addition to content questions discussed in Section 4.4.3, there is a color question. A color question is used to
inquire about the color of an object and is formed by the use of the word ¿Igid? ‗What color (is it)?‘
Examples
    1. ¿Molde, igid?               ‗The mola, what color (is it)?‘
    2. ¿Ulde, igid?                ‗The canoe, what color (is it)?‘
    3. ¿Mol igid?                  ‗What color cloth?‘
Exercise 7. Pure color drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it. The student repeats Sentence 1, changing to the -ne
‗going to ...‘ form. The student then repeats Sentence 1, changing to the -cha ‗completed aspect‘ form. The
teacher says Sentence 2, etc.
Example         Teacher: An mol kinnid pakpi.
                Student: An mol kinnid pakpi.
                Student: An mol kinnid pakne.
                Student: An mol kinnid pakcha.

         3. An mol arrad pakpi.            ‗I want to buy blue/green cloth.‘
         4. An mol chibu pakpi.            ‗I want to buy white cloth.‘
         5. An mol chichid pakpi.          ‗I want to buy black cloth.‘
Exercise 8. Equivalent color suffix drill
The teacher says the shade of Color Suffix 1 below. Then the teacher says the colors A–E one by one. The
student adds Suffix 1 to each of the colors said by the teacher. The teacher says the shade of Color Suffix 2.
Then the teacher says the colors A–E one by one. The student adds Suffix 2 to each of the colors said by the
teacher, etc.
Examples          Teacher:   -gwad

      It is difficult to ascribe a specific meaning to the discourse markers.
286                                                                                                    ClassificationsExample        An wis igal onakwia.            ‗(Explaining) I‘m going to tell you a story.‘4) jáj
      Although jáj ‗challenge‘ is often used to make a real question (one that expects an answer) into a
      rhetorical question (one that doesn‘t expect an answer), in a wider sense, it is used to challenge the listener
      to dispute or contradict what he has said.
Example        ¿Inkwa pe takcha, jáj?          ‗When did you see (it), (go on tell me)?‘5) -chulchi/-zhulchi/-julchi
      When the speaker feels that the audience is in agreement with him, the appeal for agreement is a mere
      formality and the point will be willingly conceded, the suffix -chulchi/-zhulchi/-julchi ‗Isn‘t that so?‘ is
      used (see Monologue 19.1, Sentence 2).
Example
           Teun Pedro maimojulchi.                          ‗At that time Peter was home, wasn‘t he? (Everybody
                                                            knows he was.)‘6) itos
      The marker itos ‗(you) understand‘ is used to mark explanatory comments of background or additional
      information (see Dialogue 15.1, Sentence 11).
Example        An pega ochi ukmogo itos.       ‗I‘ll give you a candy too, (you understand).‘7) takcha/taikcha
      The marker takcha/taikcha ‗you understand‘ is also used to appeal/ask for understanding. However,
      takcha is used with mainline information such as the main points of an argument, or an important
      explanation on which the outcome of the story is dependent (see Section 20.1, Sentence 5).
Example
           An pega mani uko, anka immal pakegal ,           ‗I‘ll give you some money, see, to buy me something.‘
           takcha.8) takenye
      The marker takenye ‗appeal for credibility‘ is used when the speaker is appealing for the believing
      support of the listener(s). It is used extensively in storytelling and in narrating of personal or reported
      experiences (see 20.1, Sentence 17).
Example        Teun achu mai takenye.          ‗At that time tiger was living/at home (you) see.‘9) takenchogye
      The marker takenchogye ‗(appeal) for credibility of what was said‘ has the same meaning as takenye
      except that it relates to what was said instead of what happened (see 20.1, Sentence 20).
Example
           Koe chogal: --An ne tegil, takenchogye.          ‗Deer said, ―I‘m going then,‖ (you understand that he
                                                            said it).‘10) chogeye
      The marker chogeye ‗it is said‘ is used when the speaker disclaims any responsibility for what is said. It is
      usually assumed to be fiction (see 20.1, Sentence 4).
20.5 Vocabulary                                                                                                     287Example       Koe mai chogeye.                ‗Once upon a time, deer was living/at home.‘11) chogchundo
     The expression chogchundo ‗it is said and it is supposed to be true‘ is used when the speaker is claiming
     what he said to be true but at the same time he is not accepting the responsibility for what is being said.
Example
          Tadgan maidgin teob kuschogchundo.               ‗That‘s what happened when the ancestors were alive.
                                                           (They say it is true.)‘12) itoleye
     The speaker is advising his listener that the statement itoleye ‗it is understood‘ is surmise on the part of
     someone other than himself (see 20.1, Sentence 30).
Example       Koe untar immal mecha itoleye.           ‗Deer killed many creatures (it is) understood.‘20.5    Vocabulary

           APPENDIX A: LONG AND SHORT WORD FORMS
In Kuna, many words and suffixes (though not all) have long and short forms. That is to say, certain words or
suffixes occur in various specific situations with the final vowel and in others it is deleted, without altering the
meaning of the word or suffix. The use of the short form of words/suffixes is more common, while the use of
the long form is more restricted. The number of words/suffixes which have both long and short forms varies
according to the class of word; these are listed in Section 1 below. General rules for predicting which
words/suffixes have a long or short form are given in Section 2, and rules governing the use of the long form are
given in Section 3.","[298, 299, 300, 301]"
"11.4.1.3 Greetings used in the village1) Arrival greeting
     It is common for people to announce their arrival at a place (a house or another location) by saying the
     following:
               Anná.                           ‗Hello/I‘ve come.‘2) Successive arrival greeting
     Subsequent arrivals at the same location are announced by saying the following:
               An pemalzhe tanibal.            ‗I‘ve come (back) again to you (all).‘3) First greeting of the day
     The greeting for the first encounter for the day (usually used only in the morning) is the following:
               ¿Ig oipos?                      ‗How are you this morning? (How did you greet the dawn?)‘4) General greeting
     A general greeting that may be used at any time of the day (whether it is your first encounter with the
     person or not) is the following:
       ¿Igi kude?                ‗How are (things)?‘
       ¿Tegidde?                 ‗What‘s new?/What‘s happening?‘5) Greeting from a passerby
     When you are walking through the village, it is customary to call out to the houses you pass using such
     greetings as the following:
       ¿Pemalde?                 ‗(How are) you (all)?‘
       ¿Pukwamal?                ‗Are you there?‘
       ¿Pemaldega?               ‗(How is it) with you (all)?‘
132                                                                                        Conversation Continuance6) Greeting to a passerby
      People in a house often call to a passerby in greetings using such expressions as the following:
       ¿Pia ne?                ‗Where are you going?‘
       ¿Pia ti?                ‗Where have you been?‘
       A person returning from his field, or from fishing/hunting may be greeted with the following:
       ¿Kep tani?              ‗Are you just now (for the first time) getting back?‘11.4.1.4 Greeting exchanges used as a traveller returns from a trip
The greeting exchange with a person just returning from a trip varies according to whether the traveller is
greeting the villager, the villager is greeting the traveller, or the traveller is already at home and receiving
callers.
Examples
Traveller greets a villager:
      1. Traveller:            ¿Pemal pukwade?           ‗You who are here, how are you?‘
      2. Villager:             Pukwamala.                ‗We are here, and we are fine.‘
Villager greets a traveller:
      3. Villager:             ¿Tani?                    ‗You‘ve come?‘
      4. Traveller:            Eye.                      ‗Yes.‘
Traveller at home receiving callers:
      5. Caller:               ¿Noni?                    ‗You‘ve arrived?‘
      6. Traveller:            Eye.                      ‗Yes.‘11.4.2 Establishment of topic (Ex. 4)
The topic of a conversation must be established. It is usually established by a question as discussed in Section
4.4.3.2. If the topic of the conversation is not implicit in the situation, the person who begins the conversation
must clearly set the topic or other people involved in the conversation will not know what is being discussed. A
topic-establishing question uses a specific intonation pattern, order of sentence, and also the long form of the
topic. Such suffixes as -din/-tin, -de/-te may be used to establish a topic, as discussed in Lesson III.D.5.
Exercise 4. Review
Review the use of topic-establishing questions in Section 4.4.3.2 and the use of topic-establishing suffixes
-din/-tin and -de/-te in 3.4.5 and Appendix E.","[144, 145]"
"3. Variation
Next, you learn to modify (vary) what you have just learned in section 2 above, in the same context. For
example, you discover that by adding -ga to toa ‗who‘ (modifying it), you get toaga ‗to, for whom‘. Also, you
discover that by adding -bak to toa ‗who‘ (another modification), you get toabak ‗with whom‘ which you can
now use in the same context (amplificatory questions).
Examples
    1. ¿Toa ob chus?                         ‗Who fetched the corn?‘
    2. ¿Toaga ob chus?                       ‗For whom did (he) fetch the corn?‘
    3. ¿Toabak ob chus?                      ‗With whom did (he) fetch the corn?‘4. Limited Control
Then you learn to control what you have learned in other limited contexts. For example, you move from
controlling toa ‗who‘ only in amplificatory questions, to controlling toa ‗who‘ in topic questions and
confirmation questions though all in the limited context of questions.
Examples
    1. ¿Toa koe makcha?                      ‗Who killed the deer?‘
    2. ¿Koede, toa tar makcha?               ‗Who killed the deer?‘
    3. ¿Toa makcha?                          ‗Who (did you say) killed (the deer)?‘5. Complete control
Finally, you learn to control what you are learning in any context and use it automatically whenever you need it
to communicate what you want to say. For example, you learn to use toa elsewhere in the language.
Example       Meke toa tule tani.            ‗Let anybody come.‘C. What You Have To Do To Succeed
Robert Gunn (personal communication) suggests there are three essential requirements for success: 1) speak the
language, 2) keep others talking, and 3) plan your contacts.",[322]
"12.3 CULTURE
The Kuna culture has a highly developed democratic system. Any adult man or woman has the right to speak at
length on any subject in a town meeting. The protocol of town meetings is quite rigid and it is helpful for the
outsider to be aware of certain rules which Kunas observe in their meetings.
The order in which people speak is strictly adhered to. The order is: village leaders in order of status, older men
(tadgana), younger men (machimala), male outsiders, older women, younger women, female outsiders.
Before the meeting, you are expected to advise the chief, who calls the meeting, of any subject you wish to have
discussed. At that time, you must also discuss any questions the chief might have concerning the subject you
wish discussed.
Normally, the chief will call on you, the outsider, to speak when your item on the agenda is reached. Once you
have presented your case, it is not polite to interrupt another speaker who is speaking to your subject. If you feel
you need to answer a certain objection or correct a misunderstanding, you may ask the chief for permission to
speak again before further discussion takes place.
At the close of the discussion, the chief will announce to you the official acceptance or rejection of your
proposal/request. It is not proper for you, as an outsider, to speak on any subject which does not directly involve
you or the people you represent. Visiting Kunas from outside the community have the same rule imposed upon
them.
If you wish to be excused from a meeting which you are expected to attend, you must inform the chief or the
chowal ibed deputy. He is the person who officially notified you of the time and place of the meeting.",[155]
"1) Subject omitted from simple sentence and stated in postpredicate position in answer to question
     One situation in which the subject is omitted in the main part of the sentence and stated in the
     postpredicate position is in answer to a question. If the replier wishes to emphasize the subject as he
     replies to a question, he may do so by omitting it in the main part of the sentence and stating it,
     accompanied by the suffix -din/-tin, in the postpredicate position.
Examples
   1a. ¿Pia pe ne?                             ‗Where are you going?‘
    b. Chapurbal ne; antin.                    ‗I am going to the jungle.‘
   2a. ¿Piade?                                 ‗Where (is he)?‘
    b. Nad; Luisdin.                           ‗Louis, went.‘2) Subject omitted from simple sentence and stated in postpredicate position in storytelling
     Another situation in which the subject is omitted from the main part of the sentence, but occurs in the
     postpredicate position is in the midst of the narration of a story or a tale of activities. This situation is
     dictated by the rules of storytelling and discourse structure. In a story, when the subject is omitted in the
     main part of the sentence and stated in the postpredicate position, it is accompanied by the topic marking
     suffix -de/-te (see Appendix E).
250                                                                                             Situational ExplanationExamples
On a peccary hunt, the hunters had tried to head off the animals and to arrive at another point before the animals
did. On their arrival at the expected meeting place, they discover...
      1. Pato nas; yannude.                             ‗The peccaries have already gone by.‘
      2. Mutik, nakwal chule amine, machide.            ‗Tonight the boy is going to hunt paca upriver.‘18.4.5.2 Direct object stated in main clause, and only adjective stated in the postpredicate
            position
When the speaker wishes to highlight/clarify an evaluation of a direct object, only the direct object is stated in
the main clause and only the adjective is stated in the postpredicate position. In other words, when the speaker
wishes to give his opinion of the object, its relative size, quantity or relative weight, etc., only the adjective
occurs in the postpredicate position. All adjectives are not of an evaluatory nature. Those which are not
evaluatory (e.g., colors) may not occur alone in the postpredicate position.
If the evaluatory adjective is descriptive, the short form is used, and the stress changes to the last syllable of the
adjective. Derived adjectives do not change their stress.
Examples
      1. Tad ul chobzha; totó.               ‗The grandfather made the canoe (what in my opinion is) small.‘
      2. Antin mol pakcha; tatár.            ‗I bought a flimsy (piece of) cloth.‘
      3. Tad ul chobzha; ul yer tummad. ‗The elder made a very big canoe.‘
      4. Machi koe makcha; kallagwa.         ‗The boy killed a (in my opinion) thin deer.‘
When a speaker highlights an object and evaluates it in terms of the class of similar objects to which it belongs,
the suffix -gwa/-kwa is added to the adjective. Some adjectives may not take the suffix, e.g., tummad ‗big‘.
Examples
    1. Tad ul chobzha; totogwa.                               ‗The elder made (what in my opinion is) a (one of the)

        2.    Machi koe makcha; kallagwa.                     ‗The boy shot (what in my opinion is) (one of the)
                                                              small deer.‘Exercise 8. Postpredicate position (object evaluation) frame drill

       5. ¿Pe immal amine?                  ‗Are you going to go hunting?‘18.4.3 Gerundial verb form (Ex. 7)
The gerund in English is formed by adding the ending -ing to the verb stem, whereas in Kuna it is composed of
the long form of the verb stem, that is to say, the verb stem which has the -e. There is no tense aspect suffix in
the Kuna gerund.
The gerund is able to act like a noun, for example, ―The doing of it is difficult.‖ In Kuna, as in English, the
gerund focuses on the type of action, versus the doing of the action. Take for example the two phrases, ―to plant
rice‖ and ―rice planting‖. The first phrase tends to focus on the doing of the action, whereas the second phrase
tends to focus on the act itself.
Examples
      1. An cho chike.           ‗I have been firewood cutting.‘
         but
      2. An cho chikti.          ‗I have been to cut firewood.‘
Following are illustrations of the lack of time aspect suffix:

Exercise 7. Gerund stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks one of the three questions listed below and then selects one of the verbs listed below and says
it. The student replies to the teacher‘s question using the gerund, i.e., -e form of the verb in the frame. This
exercise should be repeated several times, changing the frame to some other suitable one.
Example         Teacher: ¿Pia pe ne?
                Teacher: chik
                Student: Mas chike.

     10. chu           ‗to fetch/take‘18.4.4 Qualitative suffix -gwa/-kwa
The qualitative suffix -gwa/-kwa is used to identify/describe an object by its nature/quality and parallels the
English construction ‗a ____ one‘. This suffix may be added to some nouns and many adjectives; one must
learn which forms are acceptable and which are not, since there are no general rules.
Examples
       1. We omegwa e mimmi akwe.                   ‗A female (one) cares for the young.‘
       2. Machi orokwagwa.                          ‗The boy is (a) short (one).‘
The suffix -d(i) may be added to the -gwa/-kwa form of a word and has the effect of the definite English article
―the‖.
Examples
    1. Antin omegwad(i) pakcha.                         ‗I bought the female (of a pair).‘
    2. Pe anka es orokwagwad(i) uko.                    ‗Please give me the short machete.‘18.4.5 Postpredicate position of basic elements (Ex. 8–20)
In Lesson XVII, general guidelines for using the postpredicate position were discussed. In this lesson,
guidelines specific to the basic elements of the sentence -- subject, direct object, and predicate -- are discussed.","[260, 261, 262]"

      This is the most common and easiest way of getting information, whether in a formal language session or
      a casual contact. However, you need to follow up on your first question: e.g., if you saw a pig and asked,
      ¿Ibi wede? ‗What is that?‘ then if feasible, you should follow it up with a whole string of questions, such
      as:
  2. ¿Ibi kun?                           ‗What does it eat?‘
  3. ¿Pia mai?                           ‗Where does it live?‘
  4. ¿Toagad?                            ‗Whose is it?‘
  5. ¿Ibi chenai?                        ‗What is it doing?‘
  6. ¿Igi talde, igi pe ebinzhe?         ‗What do you think, how does it look?‘
      This type of questioning will do several things for you:
      1. It may produce new vocabulary.
      2. It will reinforce old vocabulary.
      3. It will help you determine the usage of words. You will discover that chickens don‘t kun ‗eat‘ food but
         that they ma ‗peck‘ food.
      4. It will help you build up vocabulary according to topic (according to semantic field). This means that
         you will become familiar with many of the words associated with ―pigs‖ in the above example. That
         means that the next time you are out on a walk, you will not only be able to comment ¡Pe take, china!
         ‗Look, pigs!‘ but you will be able also to comment on their size, color, activity, likes and dislikes, what
         they taste like, etc.
      5. By using the new word in several questions, you will learn it.","[326, 327]"

  Time expressions occasionally occur after the subject or at the end of the sentence, as discussed in 12.4.1.a.3, both in b)
and c).
12.4 Grammar                                                                                                      1431) Past time reference
        When the event to which the speaker is referring happened before the time of his speech, it has a past time
        reference. The past time reference can be expressed by the use of (simple) adverbs of time, or by the
        formation of complex time words. In independent simple sentences, the completive suffix -cha/-zha/-s/-ja
        usually occurs on verbs with a past time reference.a) Use of (simple) adverbs of time
     In Kuna, adverbs of time can be used to express time periods from the immediate past, immis-immis ‗just
     now‘ to asto ‗the day before yesterday‘; or they can be used to express more general past, times such as
     mutik ‗at night‘.
Examples
    1. Immis-immis an chunkal chikcha.                         ‗Just now I cut my hand.‘
    2. Sae an mol makcha.                                      ‗Yesterday I sewed a blouse.‘
    3. Asto an ua chwanad.                                     ‗The day before yesterday I went fishing.‘        b) Forming complex time words
        Specific concepts that are further into the past than ―the day before yesterday‖ are formed by attaching an
        adverb of time (iba ‗day‘, tummi ‗week‘, ni ‗month‘, pirka ‗year‘) to a number suffix and the suffix
        -gus/-kus:54 adverb of time + number suffix + -gus/-kus.
Examples
    1. iba                 + pá           + -gus = ibapagus                        ‗three days ago‘
       day                 three
    2. pirka               + gwen         + -gus = pirkagwengus                    ‗one year ago‘
       year                one

Exercise 6. Time setting in the past, stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies. The teacher repeats the question and the student replies
with an earlier setting. This drill may be repeated using other questions listed below.
Examples      Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?
              Student: Immis.         ‗today‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?
              Student: Sae.           ‗yesterday‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?
              Student: Asto.          ‗day before yesterday‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?
              Student: Ibapagus. ‗three days ago‘
The teacher should tell the student when to change from iba ‗day‘ to tummi ‗week‘ or to ni ‗month‘ or pirka
‗year‘.
         1. ¿Inkwa noni?                           ‗When did (you) arrive?‘
         2. ¿Inkwa nade?                           ‗When did (you) leave (here)?‘
         3. ¿Inkwa chobzha?                        ‗When did (you) make (it)?‘2) Future time reference
        When the event to which the speaker is referring will take place after the time of his speech, it has a future
        time reference. The future time reference may be expressed by the use of adverbs of time, or by the
        formation of complex future time words.a) Use of adverbs of time
     In Kuna, temporal adverbs are used to express time in the immediate future, immis-immis ‗just now‘56
     kujal ‗later‘, and as far into the future as achul ‗day after tomorrow‘ or they may be used to express more
     general future times such as ibegwenche ‗until some day‘.
Examples
    1. Kujal an mas kunne.                         ‗Later, I am going to eat.‘
    2. Pan an mol makne.                           ‗Tomorrow, I am going to sew a blouse.‘
    3. Achul machi ua chwane.                      ‗The day after tomorrow the boy is going to go fishing.‘
56
     The word immis-immis ‗just now‘ may refer to either past or future events, depending upon the form of the verb.
12.4 Grammar                                                                                                      145b) Forming complex future time words
     Time concepts that are further in the future than ―the day after tomorrow‖ may be expressed by attaching
     an adverb of time (iba ‗day‘, tummi ‗week‘, ni ‗month‘, or pirka ‗year‘), a number suffix and the suffix
     -che/-zhe/-je:57 adverb of time + number suffix + -che/-zhe/-je:
Examples
    1. iba                  + nerkwa       + -je = ibanerkwaje                     ‗in six days‘
       day                  six
    2. tummi                + pabak        + -che = tummipabakche                  ‗in eight weeks‘

        Time expressions (word/phrase/clause) usually occur at the beginning of a sentence. They may, however,
        occur after the subject of the sentence or at the end of the sentence.
Examples
    1. Mutik an ne.                ‗Tonight, I am going to go.‘
    2. Antin mutik ne.             ‗I am going to go tonight.‘
    3. An ne, mutik.               ‗I am going to go -- tonight!‘a) Time expressions at the beginning of a sentence
     As discussed in Section 12.4, a time expression most commonly occurs at the beginning of a sentence.
     This sentence initial position is indicated in certain situations.","[155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"
"1. Awareness
First, you need to be made aware of the existence of a particular sound, word, grammatical construction or
intonation pattern and its meaning. Yon have to learn to ―hear‖ (recognize) it in a particular context. For
example, you find out (become aware) that toa means ―who‖ and start to ―hear‖ (recognize) it when it is used in
an amplificatory question (see Section 4.4.3.1).
Example       ¿Toa nade?                     ‗Who went?‘2. Reproduction
Then, you have to learn to reproduce (say) automatically the same particular sound, word, grammatical
construction, or intonation pattern in that particular context. For example, you practice using toa ‗who‘ in
amplificatory questions until you can do so without even thinking about it.",[322]
"1) Days, weeks, and years
     Days, weeks, and years are described by the use of time-related prefixes iba- ‗day‘, tummi- ‗week‘, and
     pirka- ‗year‘. Time-related prefixes attach to any basic number stem to form a time-related number:
     time-related prefix + basic number stem.
Examples
    1. ibanerkwa                ‗six days‘
    2. tummibo                  ‗two weeks‘
    3. pirkaambe                ‗ten years‘
Exercise 15. Time-related prefix substitution frame drill
The teacher says the frame and the student repeats it. The teacher selects a word from the list below and says it.
The student then substitutes the word in the frame.
7.4 Grammar                                                                                                      81Examples      Teacher: An tummipá megne.

              Teacher: An ibapá megne.
              Student: An ibapá megne.
              Teacher: -bake
              Student: An ibabake megne.
    Frame An tummipá megne.              ‗I‘m going to stay three weeks.‘
     1. iba-                 ‗day‘
     2. -bake                ‗four‘
     3. tummi-               ‗week‘
     4. -atal                ‗five‘
     5. pirka-               ‗year‘
     6. -nerkwa              ‗six‘

     8. -kugle               ‗seven‘
     9. -bo                  ‗two‘
    10. -pabak               ‗eight‘2) Months
     The time-related number phrase used to describe months differs from other time-related number phrases
     and parallels the number phrases used for Group I and Group II number prefixes (see 5.4.1.3). The Kuna
     word for ―month‖ is ni. Ni ‗month‘ is a concrete noun which comes from the word ni ‗moon‘. Since
     Kunas personalize the word ni ‗moon/month‘, the Group I number prefix wal-/wala- is used in the number
     phrase. The time-related number phrase for month is formed by ni + (wal- + basic number stem).
Examples
    1. ni walpá                 ‗three months‘
    2. ni walanerkwa            ‗six months‘
Exercise 16. Time-related prefix substitution frame drill

     1. -bo                                   ‗two‘
     2. -pá                                   ‗three‘

      7. iba-               ‗day‘
      8. -nerkwa            ‗six‘3) Hours
     Hours in a day may be referred to by time words formed from the time-related prefix wachil- ‗o‘clock‘ or
     by the use of a specific time word.
     Specific hours may be described by a time-related number which is formed by adding a basic number stem
     to the time-related prefix wachil- ‗o‘clock‘: wachil- + basic number stem. This description of time is
     closely associated with the actual time on a clock.
Examples
    1. wachilpá               ‗three o‘clock‘
    2. wachilkugle            ‗seven o‘clock‘
    Half hours are described by using the time-related number eg ‗and‘ + abal ‗half‘.
Example      wachilbo eg abal               ‗two-thirty o‘clock‘
    Irregular times tend to be described with a combination of Kuna and Spanish loan words. A Kuna
    time-related number describes the hour. Minutes are described by either using the Spanish loan word
    minuto as a prefix to a basic number stem, or by using the basic number stem alone.
Examples
     1. wachilbo minutoambe kakaatal                  ‗2:15‘
     2. wachilbo tulagwen kakaatal                    ‗2:25‘
     3. wachilpá minutoatal                           ‗3:05‘
     4. wachilbake tulabo kakaatal                    ‗4:45‘
    Irregular time-related phrases for times past the half hour can be shortened somewhat by using a phrase:
    (minuto- + basic number stem) + napi ‗short of‘ + (wachil- + basic number stem + kugal ‗to become‘).
Examples
    1. minutoatal napi wachilbo kugal                      ‗five minutes short of two o‘clock/1:55‘
    2. minutoambe kakaatal napi wachilpá kugal             ‗fifteen minutes short of three o‘clock/2:45‘
Exercise 18. Time-related prefix changed frame drill
The teacher says Phrase 1 and the student repeats it. The teacher and the student repeat Phrase 1 in unison. The
same is done for the succeeding sentences.
Example       Teacher:                            wachilgwen
              Student:                            wachilgwen

     10. ‗9:30 o‘clock‘        wachilbakebak eg abal7.4.2 Time words
Kunas often describe time by the use of time words which parallel a general time of day rather than a specific
hour on the clock. Such words tend to describe time in relation to the sun in a similar way to the English words
―noon‖, ―afternoon‖, and ―mid-morning‖. Some examples of the more common time words are listed here and
should be memorized. Other time words are listed in Appendix D. The time words are used at the beginning of a
sentence as described in Lesson 3.4.2.2.
Following is a listing of the common time words:
      1. oipos                 ‗dawn‘
      2. wakur                 ‗morning‘
      3. yoroku                ‗noon‘
      4. chedo                 ‗evening‘
      5. neggabgwen            ‗midnight‘
      6. mutik                 ‗night‘
      7. ibgin                 ‗day‘7.4.3 Quantity-related questions (Ex. 20)
Quantity-related questions are the questions one uses to learn the quantity of an item which is being spoken of
or asked for. Quantity-related questions can be asked by using the general term melu ‗How much?‘ or by the
use of a quantity-related question number phrase, using the suffix -bigwa.
84                                                                                            Buying and Selling7.4.3.1 Melu „How much?‟
Melu ‗How much?‘ is a question word which is used in order to question the quantity of an item which is being
requested or spoken of. It is a general term and can be used with all classes of items.
Examples
    1. ¿Melu pei?                            ‗How many (do you want)?‘
    2. ¿Nuzhade, melu napi?                  ‗How many eggs are you short?‘7.4.3.2 -bigwa „How many?‟
A quantity-related question number is formed by using the suffix -bigwa. The suffix -bigwa is added to the
number prefix which applies to the item being discussed: (¿number prefix + -bigwa?).
Examples
    1. ¿Masde, walabigwa?                    ‗How many plantains (are there)?‘
    2. ¿Ibabigwa peine?                      ‗How many days are you going to stay?‘
    3. ¿Kwabigwa nalas nika?                 ‗How many oranges do you have?‘
    4. ¿Karta, kabigwa nika?                 ‗How much money do you have?‘
    5. ¿Tagarde, kukbigwa pei?               ‗How many bundles of thatch do you want?‘
    6. ¿Wachilbigwa?                         ‗What time is it?‘
Exercise 20. Time-related prefix stimulus response drill
The teacher gives the stimulus in the form of a question. The student responds using the correct form of the
numeral.
Example       Teacher: ¿Ibabigwa megne?
              Student: Ibabake megne.
      1. ¿Ibabigwa megne?               ‗How many days are you going to stay?‘
      2. ¿Tummibigwa megne?             ‗How many weeks are you going to stay?‘
      3. ¿Ni walabigwa megne?           ‗How many months are you going to stay?‘
      4. ¿Pirkabigwa megne?             ‗How many years are you going to stay?‘
      5. ¿Wachilbigwa megne?            ‗How many hours are you going to stay?‘7.4.3.3 Igi „How much (money)?‟
Igi ‗How much?‘ is a question word which is used to find out how much an item costs. The quantity-related
question phrase is formed by adding the word mani ‗money‘ after the word igi ‗How much?‘: igi + mani.
Examples
    1. ¿Kartade, igi mani?                   ‗How much is the book?‘
    2. ¿Masde, walaatal, igi mani?           ‗How much are five plantains?‘7.5 Vocabulary

It is important to be aware of the correct intonation pattern used at different times throughout a Kuna
conversation.","[93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"
"      2) Active listening
      A less profitable way is to listen actively. Sometimes it‘s just not wise to track the speaker, so this is the
      best you can do. Think about what you are hearing. Don‘t only pay attention to the content (or meaning) of
      what is being said, but also to the way it is said. Sometimes you should concentrate on everything that is
      being said. Other times you should select a particular feature and zero in on that, e.g., where a listener
      inserts a conversation sustainer, or if there is some pattern to how one of them is used.
Appenxix N                                                                                                       313     3) Passive listening
     This is just listening to what is being said, without thinking about the intonation, grammatical construction
     used, etc. This does not mean that you have ―switched off‖ the speaker. It means that you listen to the
     speaker, like you listen to English, to hear what he is saying.c. Noting the setting
This is as important as the tracking or listening itself. It‘s no use knowing patterns of intonation, grammar, etc.,
if you don‘t know when to use them. So, whenever you are listening, notice the following:
1. What incident triggered what the speaker is saying? Was it a question? Was it an allegation? Was it what
   happened? Was it what the speaker had failed to do?
2. What is the speaker‘s emotional attitude? Is he happy, sad, angry, afraid or doubtful? Is he defensive,
   aggressive, involved, neutral or trying to disassociate himself from something?
3. What is the relative status between the speaker and the listener? Is the speaker of higher or lower status? Is
   the difference in status being ignored or even reversed?
4. Is the speaker using his authority or trying to manipulate someone? Is he only pleading?
5. Is he serious or speaking in jest?d. Gestures
Note the accompanying gestures and facial expressions.","[325, 326]"
"16.4.3.1 General area goal
If the motion is towards a general area, for example, the jungle versus a specific tree in the jungle, the general
goal suffix -bal/-pal is added to the noun. This is the same as the locative suffix for a broad setting described in
Section 8.4.1.1).
Example       Sagla chapurbal nad.            ‗The chief went to the jungle.‘
In the speaker‘s view, the jungle represents a general area, rather than a specific point.

If the motion is towards what is viewed as a specific point within a general setting, such as a home within a
town, the specific goal suffix -che/-zhe/-je103 is added to the noun.
Example       Sagla negzhe nad.                ‗The chief went home.‘
The suffix -che/-zhe/-je is also used in the sense of ‗as far as‘.
Example
       An sagla negzhe arpi.                        ‗I went as far as the chief‘s house./I went to the chief‘s house.‘16.4.3.3 General direction words
Sometimes a general direction word, rather than a general or specific area is used as the goal of motion. These
general direction words do not use the goal suffixes -bal/-pal or -che/-zhe/-je. Some general direction words
include:
  1. nakwal                          ‗up (river)‘
  2. teal                            ‗down (river)‘

3.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2)
As you learn to speak Kuna, it is important that you learn to mimic the intonation of a Kuna speaker. The
correct intonation pattern becomes automatic as you spend time with Kuna people, listening for the way they
say sentences and trying to mimic them. Do the following exercises, listening carefully to the intonation
patterns of the questions and answers, and mimicking the intonation as closely as possible.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher as he says Dialogue 3.1 by humming the intonation. Especially concentrate on the intonation
patterns of the questions and answers.
Overlearn: Mimic under your breath while the teacher works with other students.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in the above dialogue, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1)
slowing down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.","[34, 35, 36, 37]"
"4) Use of -gan/-kan versus -mal
     Any of the words which take -gan/-kan can also take -mal(a). The question arises, ―When do I choose
     -gan/-kan and when do I choose -mal(a)?‖
     a) -gan/-kan is used to refer to a class of people who are proficient in a certain area, or who have reached
     a particular social status.
Example
       Machergan ormanemal.                    ‗The men are going to meet.‘70
  When the words omemal ‗female‘ and machermal ‗male‘ are used to refer to the sex of animals and/or birds, they do not
have a derogatory connotation. For example, yannu omemal ‗peccary sows‘ and kallin machermal ‗roosters‘.
166                                                                      Communicating Community Togetherness      ―Machergan‖ refers to people who have the social prestige of being men. -gan/-kan is generally used only
      for people. It groups a class of people together, rather than describing a temporary grouping.
      b) -mal(a) is used to refer to a group of people or things as a unit. These people or things are grouped on a
      temporary basis for some reason or another and parallels the English construction, ―a group of ...‖
Examples
    1. Tulegan noni.            ‗People (who are specialists in a field) arrived.‘
    2. Tulemal noni.            ‗(A group of) people arrived.‘
Exercise 10. -mal(a) versus -gan/-kan selective choice drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student adds the suffix -mal(a) or -gan/-kan to the subject of the
sentence, as the sense of the sentence requires.
Example       Teacher: Machered noni.
              Student: Machergan noni.
      1. Machered noni.                       ‗The man arrived.‘
      2. Tule noni.                           ‗The Kuna person arrived.‘
      3. Ome turwa mine.                      ‗The woman is throwing out the rubbish.‘
      4. Achu chule kas.                      ‗The dog caught a paca.‘
      5. Machi yannu amine.                   ‗The boy is going to hunt peccary.‘5) Use of -mal(a) with -gan/-kan
      Sometimes it is necessary to speak of a group of people who have a certain status, skill, or class. To form
      this construction, you add the short form of -gan/-kan to the noun stem and then add -mal(a): noun +
      -gan/-kan + -mal(a).
Example
           Pay tolganmal pistagin arpananimal.             ‗(A group of) Paya inhabitants are working on the
                                                           airstrip.‘
      In this case, the phrase Pay tolganmal refers to a group of people who qualify in the class of inhabitants
      of Paya.","[178, 179]"
"19.4 Grammar
19.4.1 Obligation (Ex. 5–6)
Obligation parallels the English construction, ―ought to ...‖ or ―have to ...‖. This concept is expressed by adding
the obligatory suffix -nab to the long form of the verb stem.
Example
       Nuskan e pabgan atakenab.               ‗Children ought to respect their parents.‘
Exercise 5. Obligation frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise may be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: Ome mas tuenab.
              Student: Ome mas tuenab.
      1. Ome mas tuenab.                       ‗The woman has to cook the food.‘
      2. An nenab.                             ‗I have/ought to go.‘
      3. Pe an pennukenab.                     ‗You have to pay me.‘
      4. Nuskan e pabgan atakenab.             ‗Children ought to respect their parents.‘
      5. Pe anka chogenab.                     ‗You need to tell me.‘
Exercise 6. Obligation stimulus response drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies using the obligation -nab form.
Example       Teacher: ¿Pe ne?
              Student: Antin nenab.
      1. ¿Pe ne?                               ‗Are you going?‘
      2. ¿Pe kai chune?                        ‗Are you going to fetch sugar cane?‘
      3. ¿Pe saglaga chogo?                    ‗Will you tell the chief?‘
      4. ¿Pe neg chomne?                       ‗Are you going to build a house?‘
      5. ¿Pe ina too?                          ‗Will you take (swallow) the medicine (pills)?‘19.4.2 Non-obligatory expressions
Several adverbial expressions may be used to indicate that an action was done without obligation or duress.19.4.2.1 an/pe/a itoleged „my/your/his/hers/its own desire (lit.: feeling)‟
Example    Machi a itoleged nad.      ‗The boy went of his own desire.‘19.4.2.2 pinche „just (without duress or purpose)‟
When used to refer to an action executed without duress it is generally said with a disclaimer intonation (see
6.2.2).
19.4 Grammar                                                                                                   259Example       Machi pinche yogal pakcha. ‗The boy just bought the shirt (on a whim).‘19.4.2.3 naga/aga tukin „of my/one‟s own free will‟
naga/aga tukin ‗of my/one‘s own free will‘ is further discussed in Section 20.4.6.2.
Example
       Punadin aga tukin mol ukcha.           ‗The girl sold the blouse herself (of her own volition).‘19.4.3 Futility
An event or action may be perceived as being done in vain. This concept of futility is expressed by the adverb
pinche ‗in vain/for nothing‘ which, in this usage, normally occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Examples
    1. Pinche an ti.                        ‗I went for nothing.‘
    2. Pinche an ul chobzha.                ‗I might as well have not made the canoe.‘
However, when used as an adverb of futility, pinche occasionally occurs in the adverbial position.
Example       Antin pinche mani amidi.      ‗I went in vain for the money.‘
Pinche can also mean ‗just (for no reason/purpose)‘. Intonation, context and word order provide clues to which
meaning it has.","[271, 272]"

One of the most useful tools for learning the language is a device called ―tracking.‖ Tracking is instantaneously
mimicking a speaker. As the speaker starts to talk you mimic everything he says, keeping two or three syllables
behind him all the time. You should concentrate mainly on the rhythm and pitch patterns as you track,
approximating the consonant and vowel sounds as well as you can without losing speed.36
Obviously, you have to be discrete in using this tracking to learn the language in a live situation. ―Live‖
tracking, tracking actual conversation of your Kuna friends, is best. It is probably better to tell your Kuna
friends what you are doing and why you are tracking their speech. Track in a very subdued voice. If there is
objection to it, stop at once and restrict your tracking to willing friends or tapes.
Tracking tapes is also useful. If you track the same text (story or conversation) over and over it will help you
master the patterns. You should try to track different types of conversations, stories and speech styles since each
has its own characteristic pattern. Pitch, rhythm, speed, intensity, crescendo and decrescendo, range of tone, and
other more subtle features blend until each type of talking has its own distinctive ―tune‖ or set of ―tunes.‖
Types of intonation include: question-answer, travelogue, folktale, description, explanation, teaching, exhorting,
procedural explanation, argument, etc. You should track one type at a time until the patterns are learned.
Exercise 1. Tracking drill
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 9.1. Be sure to keep within two or three syllables behind him at all times.
The exercise should be repeated several times.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Dramatize the above Dialogue 9.1 with two students playing the roles of the nurse and the mother. The teacher
will be listening and checking for 1) correct intonation patterns, 2) correct pronunciation, and 3) correct
gestures.
Exercise 3. Intonation drill
Drill the problem sentences, sounds, and gestures encountered in Exercise 2 above.","[113, 114, 115, 116]"
"11.4.7.4 Farewell until sometime in the future
In the case of farewell until some future date, -che/-je/-zhe ‗until‘ is added to the time word which represents
the time that is expected to elapse before the next meeting.
Examples
       Ibabakeje.               ‗Until four days‘ time‘
       Yolzhe.                  ‗Until summer.‘

Some farewells indicate that the speaker is intending to leave the location of the conversation. These farewells
may or may not be followed by farewell terms, kujal, panmal, etc.
Examples
      Ne.                       ‗I‘m about to go.‘
      Nebi.                     ‗I want (need) to leave.‘11.4.7.6 Response to farewells (Ex. 5–14)
All farewells are responded to by one of two words: Eye. ‗Yes.‘ or Ajáj. ‗agreement‘.
Exercise 5. Greeting drill
The teacher describes the situation. The student provides a suitable greeting.
Example       Teacher: A man sees a young man with a machete in his hand passing the house.
              Student: ¿Pia ne? ‗Where are (you) going?‘
      1. You see your neighbor early in the morning.
      2. You announce your arrival as you step off the airplane.
      3. You arrive at a neighbor‘s house to visit.

              Student: ¿Pabde?         ‗(How is your) father?‘
              Teacher: You are watching a man make something.
              Student: ¿Ibi chomnai?                 ‗What are (you) making?‘
     1a. Mola.                   ‗Cloth.‘

Exercise 7. Hearing conversation sustainers
The teacher writes a selection of conversation sustainers on the blackboard and plays the tape of a story told by
him and commented on (―sustained‖) by another Kuna. The teacher points out the ―sustainer‖ as it is said. The
student should actively listen, noting and learning 1) when the response is made, 2) what ―sustainers‖ are used,
3) the variation (same ―sustainer‖ not usually used twice in a row), and 4) trying to anticipate when it will be
used and what will be used.

In order to find an equivalent to the Kuna labialized consonants, the u in the following Spanish examples must
be treated virtually as an onglide, rather than as a full vowel. The onglide sound may be achieved by
pronouncing the Spanish examples fairly quickly:
1. kw is pronounced almost like cu in cuarto ‗room‘.
2. gw is pronounced almost like gu in agua ‗water‘.
3. tw is pronounced almost like tu in santuario ‗sanctuary‘.

1.3.1 Visiting
When you go visiting in a Kuna town, it is customary to call out at the door of the house and wait for an
invitation before entering. The host or hostess will probably invite you to sit down. He/she will indicate where
you are to sit (normally on a kana ‗bench‘). Visiting chiefs or male dignitaries may be invited to sit in (actually
astride) a hammock. If you are not offered a seat, it means you are not welcome. You should make an attempt to
either increase rapport or state your business right away, in spite of the cool reception. If you are accepted, you
should exchange pleasantries before discussing business.","[20, 21]"
"2) Negative desiderative action yapa „don‟t want to‟
     As has been mentioned (see 15.4.2.2.2, Example 6), a desiderative action may be negated by adding the
     basic negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul to the verb. The desiderative action may also be negated by use of an
     adverb yapa ‗don‘t want to‘ in the adverbial position after the subject and before the object, if there is one.
     The adverb yapa ‗don‘t want to‘ has a stronger negative connotation than does the desiderative action
     suffix -bi/-pi and -chul/-jul.
Example       An yapa mol pak.                ‗I don‘t want to buy cloth.‘
Exercise 25. Yapa negative desiderative action frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example      Teacher: An yapa ne.
             Student: An yapa ne.
      1. An yapa ne.                          ‗I don‘t want to go.‘
      2. An yapa mantur kun.                  ‗I don‘t want to eat roasted plantain.‘
      3. An yapa mol pak.                     ‗I don‘t want to buy cloth.‘
      4. An yapa ina kop.                     ‗I don‘t want to take (drink) the medicine.‘
      5. An yapa wartiku.                     ‗I don‘t want to get wet.‘
Exercise 26. Yapa negative desiderative action stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a sentence and says it. The student responds using the negative form with yapa.
Example       Teacher: An nebi.
              Student: An yapa ne.
      1. An nebi.                             ‗I want to go.‘
      2. An ua kumpi.                         ‗I want to eat fish.‘
      3. An saglabak chunmabi.                ‗I want to talk to the chief.‘
      4. An ul nudabi.                        ‗I want to repair the canoe.‘
      5. An chagla chikpi.                    ‗I want to have my hair cut.‘3) Negative adverb yo „not yet‟
     The negative adverb yo ‗not yet‘ or ‗before he/she/it (had) ...‘ is used as an adverb in a subordinate
     sentence. Yo ‗not yet‘ is when the action in the independent sentence precedes that of the subordinate
     sentence. That is to say, Kuna negates an action by using yo ‗not yet‘ to indicate the concept that before
     something happened, the action in the independent sentence took place.
Example       An yo nadgu, an mas kucha. ‗Before I left, I ate (some) food.‘
Exercise 27. Yo ‗not yet‘ stimulus response drill
The teacher gives the sentence. The student responds using the yo form of the subordinate sentence.

              Student: Machi yo nadgu an mas kucha.
      1.   Machi nadgu an mas kucha.                ‗When the boy left, I ate (some) food.‘
      2.   Pun mol pakchagu an nad.                 ‗When the girl bought cloth, I left.‘
      3.   Kukualed nonigu machi pistabal arpi.     ‗When the plane arrived, the boy went to the airstrip
                                                    (and back).‘
      4.   An tian omosgu an yannu takcha.          ‗When I reached the stream, I saw the peccaries.‘
      5.   An nadel an mol pako.                    ‗When I leave, I will buy cloth.‘4) Negative adverb ampa „still‟
      The adverb ampa ‗still‘ may be used to compound with the adverb yo ‗not yet‘ to form the negative
      expression ampayo ‗still not‘. It may also be used in conjunction with the word owed ‗away/delayed‘ to
      form the negative expression ampa owed ‗still delayed‘. Ampayo and ampa owed may be used to
      indicate that an action has still not happened. It may be used in answer to the question, ―Are you ready?‖
Examples
    1. Andin ampayo mas kun.                  ‗I still have not eaten.‘
   2a. ¿Pedin pato ogus?                      ‗Are you all ready?‘

   3a. ¿Pabde mai?                            ‗Is father home?‘
    b. Ampa owed.                             ‗He is still delayed.‘
Exercise 28. Ampayo ‗not yet‘ negative adverb stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a question and asks it. The student replies using the ampayo ‗not yet‘ negative adverb.
Example        Teacher: ¿Pedin pato ne?

           together):16.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–4)
As you do the following exercises, concentrate on using correct intonation patterns. You will find that your
audience will really appreciate hearing all the details of any trip you make, no matter how brief the trip was.
Retelling the events of even a short jaunt into the jungle will provide excellent language practice. Work hard on
the intonation patterns in the following exercises so that you will be able to recount your trips in traditional
Kuna style. Your audience will be thrilled.
Exercise 1. Tracking
Track the teacher and his assistant (if available) as they say Dialogue 16.1. Concentrate on the overall
intonation patterns of the entire speech and responses.
Exercise 2. Dialogue dramatization
Dramatize Dialogue 16.1 with two students playing the roles of Traveler and Villager.
Exercise 3. Problem solving exercise
Discuss and drill any problems encountered in Exercise 2 above.
Exercise 4. Tracking
Listen to tapes of travel stories and track them, in order to thoroughly master the intonation patterns.","[220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226]"
"2.2 Pronunciation
2.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–3)
Every time you say something, you say it with a ―tune‖ (intonation). Basic intonation patterns for statements,
questions, commands, etc., should be automatic. The patterns become automatic only as you spend time
mimicking the Kuna speakers with whom you come in contact.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
First mimic the teacher as he says Dialogue 2.1 by humming the ―tune‖ (intonation patterns). Practice makes
perfect. Mimic under your breath while the teacher works with other students.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 2.1, pronouncing the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing
down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.
Exercise 3. Intonation of ‗I want to ____.‘
Mimic the teacher by humming the intonation of the following:
         1. An mas kumpi.                             ‗I want to eat food.‘
         2. An mas pakpi.                             ‗I want to buy food.‘

In 1.2.2., the contrast between lenis consonants and fortis consonants was introduced. Fortis consonants in Kuna
are written p, t, k, ch, mm, nn, ss, ll, and rr.72.2.3 Pronunciation of individual fortis consonant sounds (Ex. 4–8)
The parts of the vocal apparatus used in the pronunciation of fortis consonants are the same as those used for the
lenis consonant counterparts. The difference in pronunciation lies in the fact that the vocal apparatus is kept very
taut or tense in the pronunciation of fortis consonants. They are much stronger sounds than their lenis counterparts.","[23, 24]"
