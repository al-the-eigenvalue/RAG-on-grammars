10.1.1.     Polar questions with the interrogative clitic =aPolar questions can involve verbal and non-verbal predicates. In the former
case, the illocutionary particle cliticizes to the verb, in the latter case, the
particle cliticizes to the non-verbal predicate term.
    The interrogative clitic =a is realized as =ya when following /a/, e.g.
naka=ya? ‘A man?’. After emphatic and restrictive pronouns, which end in
the emphatic suffix -ta, the interrogative clitic =a is also realized as =ya, but
here the preceding /a/ is deleted, e.g. kb-ta ‘you (M, EMPH)’ and kb-t=ya? ‘Is
it you?’, y-ta ‘only this (restrictive)’ and y-t=ya? ‘Is it only this?’
    In polar questions involving verbal predications the interrogative particle
cliticizes to the finite verb, as in the formulaic greeting in (1):(1)       klayâm             bi-Ø-eb=a?
          properly_good      stay.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
          ‘Are you (staying) well?’ [Observed]Constituent order does not change in questions. The declarative marker =be,
the emphatic/quotative marker =bo, or the exclamative marker =ble are simply
replaced by =a and the utterance receives a marked intonational contour as
opposed to the corresponding declarative sentence. Compare the polar
question in (2) and its declarative counterpart in (3):(2)       kb             mn=e         sm     gwáab

                                                      10.1. Polar questions   387       bi-Ø-e=be
       stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘Your boy is still small.’The verb in (2) is pronounced bia. On this unusual contracted form, see
section 8.6.5, where irregularities in the inflection of the existential verb are
described.
   Optionally, polar questions can additionally contain the interrogative clitic
m (as opposed to negative mo with low tone). This typically encliticizes to
the final constituent before the predicate, as in (4), but can appear as a free
word if it occurs clause initially, as in example (15) below.(4)    ns      lo=m

       like.PFV-give.PFV-N2.R-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
       ‘Do you like this song?’As with the negative clitic mo, interrogative m may only occur once per
sentence. Thus, it may only appear once in any given clause chain, which
constitutes one sentence. Usually this would be the first clause to signal right
from the start that a question is coming:(5)    kbo       glol-amît=o=m             betelâ’-n-eb=a

       ‘Did you open and again close the window?’ [TMA Questionnaire,
       61]The interrogative marker =a can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to query whether the addressee wants the speaker or the group of which
both speaker and addressee are members to perform a certain action:(6)    ayal=e            kemela-n-an=a?

       go.PFV-REAL-1PL.SBJ.HORT=Q
       ‘Shall we go?’ [Observed]In polar questions involving non-verbal predications the interrogative particle
attaches to either a noun (8), an emphatic pronoun (9), a distal demonstrative
(10), an adjective (11), or an adverb (12). The interrogative clitic m may not
be used. The range of possible hosts for the clitic is exactly co-extensive with
the range of word classes that can appear in the predicate slot in declarative
non-verbal clauses. Detailed information on non-verbal clauses can be found
in section 9.11.(8)    tíl=a?
       dog=Q
       ‘Is it a dog?’(9)    n-t=ya?

       slowly=Q
       ‘Is it (done) slowly?’Possible answers to these five non-verbal questions are given in (13):(13)   a. ae tíl=o=be                                ‘Yes, it’s a dog.’

sentence. In that case, there is no illocutionary clitic. This is illustrated for a
non-verbal predication in (14), and a sentence whose predicate is a finite verb,
in which case the interrogative clitic m is commonly used (15):(14)      yi=e              yi        bleka?
          wound=SG.N1        wound or
          ‘A wound, is it a wound?’ (lit. ‘A wound, a wound, or?’) [Pig story](15)      m      wentê-b-eb=ta                        o-b-i

          or
          ‘Do you understand what I’m saying?’
          (Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m saying, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]Questions with bleka ‘or’ at the end are not leading but rather neutral polar
questions that introduce the (implied) negation of the proposition as a second
alternative, which is equally probable. Thus, the alternatives offered in (14)
are that the referent either is a wound or is not a wound. This is a type of polar
question because the appropriate responses are ‘yes’ or ‘no’.","[412, 413, 414, 415]"
"
10.1.      Polar questionsThe appropriate answer for a polar question is ‘yes’ or ‘no’, which are ae and
yeye in Mian, respectively. They are formed with the interrogative illo-
cutionary clitic =a. Very rarely, one finds polar questions with =e (which is
usually used for content questions). Like all illocutionary particles (see
386       10. Question formation3.13.1), =a encliticizes to the immediately preceding word and forms a single
prosodic word with it. A second type of polar question ends with bleka ‘or’.
   Intonationally, polar questions are characterized by a short intonational
peak and subsequent fall on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is
formed by the illocutionary particle or the final syllable of bleka ‘or’.","[411, 412]"
"
3.13.4.    The negative clitic =moThe negative clitic =mo is used in clauses that are negated with =ba ‘negation’
and prohibitives (see 8.6.7.6). It cannot be used in negated non-verbal
predications. =Mo typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the
verb. It can occur as a free word clause-initially. Examples of =mo in
declaratives can be found in 3.13.3 above. An example of the prohibitive is
given in (201):(201) mo         dob-ski
          NEG    3SG.M_CL.O-turn          dob-ski-n-em-eb=e!
          3SG.M_CL.O-turn-AUX.PFV-DEONT-2SG.SBJ=HORT
          ‘Do not keep turning him (a male child) around!’ [Crows]If the negated verb consists of a coverb and a function verb in case of a
function-verb construction, =mo attaches to the final constituent before the
whole predicate, which includes the coverb accompanying a function verb. An
example is:

      ‘I don’t know.’
3.13.5.       The interrogative clitic =mThe interrogative clitic =m is employed in polar questions (see 10.1.1). Like
negative =mo, interrogative =m typically encliticize to the final constituent
before the verb (or the coverb in case of a function-verb construction) but can
occur as a free word clause-initially. An example is (204):(204) m          wentê-b-eb=ta                           o-b-i
          Q       hear.IPFV-DS.SIM-2SG.SBJ=MED            say.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ          bleka?
          or
          ‘Do you understand what I’m saying?’
          (Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m saying, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]
3.13.6.       The topic clitic =leThe topic clitic =le attaches to preceding noun phrases and adverbial and
medial clauses to indicate their topicality. The reader is referred to later
sections for examples and more detailed information on topicalized noun
phrases (6.9), topicalized medial clauses (11.3), and topicalized adverbial
clauses (13.2.5). An example of a topicalized noun phrase is (205):(205) memé               =le              ||   Sobining=e
      children           PL.AN=TOP              PN=SG.M          dl-êt-n-e=a
          PL.AN.O-take-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
          ‘As for the children, Sobining took them and ...’ [Sobining]The use of =le in topic-only questions is discussed in 10.3.

noun phrases to express the notion that something which is expressed in the
same sentence or which is obvious from the context also applies to the referent
of the noun phrase. This is illustrated for a first and second person singular
pronoun in (206) and (207), respectively, and for a noun phrase in subject,
(206) and (207), and object position (208) and (209):(206) n=sa       klayâm             bl-Ø-i=be

          ‘The shinbones too became all ashes.’ (lit. ‘all “ashified” ’) [Crows](209) tk         =sa           glagl-tem-daak

          ‘they put the leaf (bag) too down between (them) as well’ [Danenok]Prima facie it might look that =sa ‘too’ is another suffix which derives
complex pronouns from simple ones, like -ta derives emphatic pronouns
(3.7.4). However, consider the following example which shows that if sa was
a pronoun suffix, we would not expect it to follow the topic clitic, which
marks noun phrases as topicalized not just noun:(210) y le        li=le=sa                      besa     y

          ‘Well, while these too were just living there (i.e. without trouble or
          altercations with their neighbours), they…’ [Mianmin and
          Telefomin]
3.13.8.     Interjections and formulaic utterancesInterjections are particles which express assent or dissent, emotional states,
and hesitation in speech. Due to the fact that interjections are usually uttered
with a marked intonation, and the difficulty of teasing apart lexical tone and
intonation, I will not mark tone on interjections. The inventory comprises:(211) ae, ai                               ‘yes’
      ayasi                                ‘expressing surprise or disbelief’
      ayo                                  ‘sorry (feeling regret or pity)’
      ba (< baa ‘say’)                     ‘ehm (hesitation in speech)’
      dowe                                 ‘boah man’
      ekskyus (from Tok Pisin)             ‘excuse me’
      klâye                                ‘well now’
      o                                    ‘oh’
      yait, yaiks (from Tok Pisin)         ‘yuck’
      yle, yle                           ‘well (also hesitation)’
      yeye                                 ‘no’The interjection ayo can only express regret and is not used for apologies.
   I think it is plausible that ba ‘ehm’ indicating hesitation goes back to the
verb stem baa ‘say (PFV)’. As bare verb stems are commonly used as
imperatives, it is conceivable that speakers used the imperative form baa
[mbà] ‘Say (it)!’ to “order themselves” to continue speaking. Synchronically,
however, the interjection ba is not pronounced with a pharyngealized /a/.
   In the eastern dialect, there are no interjections for the purpose of greeting
people. Instead whole formulaic sentences are exchanged. The following
patterns of question and answer are customary:Arriving party says:                         Customary answer:
bo y bliba? — ‘Are you (PL) there?’        ae, n y biobobe — ‘Yes, we are there.’
klayâm bieba? — ‘Are you well?’              ae, klayâm blibe — ‘Yes, I am well.’Departing party says:                        Customary answer:
klayâm biebte! — ‘Stay well!’                klayâm one! — ‘Go well!’

                                           slept (well).’Going to sleep:                            Customary anwser:
klayâm áan one! — ‘(Go to) Sleep well!’    kbsa klayâm áan one! — ‘You too (go
                                           to) sleep well!’Both parties meet (on a path):             Customary answer:
kbo y tleba? — ‘You have come to         (ae,) y tlibe ‘(Yes,) I have come to this
this place.’                               place?’In the western dialect area, the form klayâmo ‘really good’ is commonly used
to say hello or bid farewell to somebody. Speakers of the eastern dialect do
not have this convention.","[185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"
"
9.13.      A note on causativesLike many languages, Mian has lexical causatives where an intransitive verb
and its causative counterpart are realized as distinct lexical verb stems:(154) Intransitive                 Causative
      ein ‘cook’                   fu ‘cook’
      kaan ‘die (PFV)’             -nâ’ ‘kill (PFV)’
      bokbok ge ‘boil (PFV)’       bafu ‘boil’In addition to this, ambitransitive verbs have a causative element as part of
their meaning when used transitively, cf. halò ‘break (intransitive) vs. halò
382    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause‘(cause to) break (transitive)’ or dòu ‘close (intransitive)’ vs. dòu ‘(cause to)
close (transitive)’. On ambitransitives, see 9.3.
    There is no morphological causative. The syntactic causative construction
is a special form of verb serialization consisting of (exactly) two verbs, where
subject marking is used to index the causer on the first verb and the causee on
the second verb. For more information on causative serializations, see 11.1.5.
An example of a causative serialization is given in (155):(155) geim=e                          tob-â’-i
      pronged_arrow=SG.N1             3SG.LONG.O-let_go.PFV-1SG.SBJ       un-Ø-e=be
       go.PFV-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ=MED
       ‘I dropped the pronged arrow.’ (lit. ‘I let go of the arrow and it
       went.’)What I would like to do in the remainder of this section is to discuss one case
that has been identified as the “Mian causative construction” in the literature.
Smith and Weston (1974b: 138) claim that: “[t]he verb kimanin ‘watch over,
command’ is used in the first clause of a sequence sentence [i.e. a clause
chaining construction – SF]” to indicate a cause-effect relation. They give one
example. Morpheme breakdown, glosses and translation are Smith and
Weston’s (1974a: 139):6(156) awok-o           men-e         ki-mab-o               a     aay-e
      mother-CM        child-CM      command-FUT-she        SEQ   water-CM       fuela-n-a-mab-e        bo
       bathe-PU-NU-FUT-he     IND.EMPH
       ‘The mother will command the child and he will bathe.’ i.e. ‘The
       mother will make the child bathe.’Based on Smith and Weston’s data and glosses Song (1996: 36-37) classifies
the construction in (156) as an overt AND type of causative in his typological
survey of causatives, i.e. a biclausal construction with an overt coordinating
element, in this case a ‘sequential’ connecting the clauses specifying cause
and effect. Before going into the question whether this construction is really a
causative, the morphological analysis has to be corrected.
   First, Smith and Weston analyse -mab in kimabo erroneously as a future
form though medial verbs in Mian are never inflected with -mab (which I
gloss as ‘irrealis’). Although they do not explicitly say so, no forms inflected
                                               9.13. A note on causatives   383with -mab appear in their table summarizing the morphology of the medial
verb nor do any of their examples have medial verbs inflected with -mab.
   Second, the verb involved is not ki but rather is kimâa’ ‘watch over (PFV)’
(with a pharyngealized /a/). This verb cannot be inflected directly in the
imperfective but needs an auxiliary before it can be inflected (cf. the verbal
noun kimâa’-nin ‘(activity of) watching over’, where nin is the verbal noun of
the existential verb).
   My analysis of (156) above is:(157) awók=o           mn=e
      mother=SG.F      child=SG.M       kimâa’-bi-Ø-o=a7
       watch_over.PFV-AUX.IPFV-DS.SIM-3SG.F.SBJ=MED       aaie     fuela-n-amab-e=bo
       water    bathe.PFV-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-3SG.M.SBJ=EMPH
       ‘While the mother is watching over the child, it will bathe.’The second issue with Smith and Weston’s analysis is semantic in nature.
Although it is true that the verbal noun kimâa’nin can be used as a noun with
the meaning ‘boss, minder’, the verb stem kimâa’ essentially means ‘watch
over, look out for (PFV)’ and not ‘command’. There is not a single instance in
my corpus where kimâa’ could be felicitously translated as ‘command’. In my
view, it is mainly the glossing of kimâa’ as ‘command’ that suggests that we
are dealing with a causative construction.
   Furthermore, even the assumption of a potential causative construction
with kimâa’ ‘watch over (PFV)’ in a medial clause indicating causation, is not
supported by my data. Nowhere does the clause following a medial clause
with kimâa’ express an effect related to a causer, who would be the subject of
kimâa’.
   To conclude, I am very sceptical as to whether a causative analysis of the
construction in (157) is valid. Such constructions may have a causative
implicature at best but they are not dedicated causatives.

Question formation
10.0.      IntroductionThis chapter deals with the formation of questions. Formally, there are five
different types of question in Mian. Questions can employ:1)      only the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence
2)      bleka ‘or’ at the end of the sentence, and no interrogative clitic =a
3)      the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence and
        bleka ‘or’ inside the sentence (separating two alternatives)
4)      the interrogative illocutionary clitic =e plus an interrogative phrase with
        either fàb ‘where’ or wan ‘who’
5)      the topic clitic =leFunctionally, these can be assigned to the following types:
    Types (1) and (2) are polar questions, i.e. questions for which the
appropriate answer is ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
    Type (3) are alternative questions, where the speaker wants a specification
of the offered alternatives, e.g. Do you want pork or fish for dinner?.
    Type (4) are content questions, which are used to request information about
the who, what, when, etc. of an event or action. Content questions consist of a
proposition which is completely presupposed apart from one element, which is
the one queried (Givón 1990: 714-715). In Mian, the maximum number of
queried constituents is one. Thus, multiple constituent questions, such as
English Who did what?, are not possible.
    Type (5) are topic-only questions, in which only a topic is given, as in
English What about John? or And you?. The speaker has a particular question
in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied question is.","[407, 408, 409, 410, 411]"
"
10.1.3.       Alternative questions with bleka ‘or’When using an alternative question the speaker expects the addressee to
specify one of two alternatives offered rather than just say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. They
are formed with the interrogative clitic =a and do not involve a change of
constituent order. The maximum number of alternatives is two. The
conjunction bleka ‘or’ conjoins the elements denoting the alternative options
in polar questions. These can be two noun phrases, as in (16), or two
sentences, as in (17):(16)      kbo        aning     -ta                  bleka
          2SG.M       fish      SG.M-EMPH             or          éil    -ta               dowôn’-aamab-eb=a?
          pig    SG.M-EMPH          eat.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
          ‘Do you want to eat fish or pork?’ [Observed]

        ‘Are you staying in the village today or are you going to the garden?’If the alternatives given are instantiated by noun phrases each needs an
emphatic pronoun in adnominal position, as in (16) above, not just an article.
The use of the interrogative clitic m in alternative questions is unattested.","[415, 416]"
"
10.2.     Content questionsIn content questions, the speaker requests information about some participant,
theme, location, time, manner, etc. of an event or action. The proposition of a
content question is presupposed apart from the queried constituent.
   Content questions are formed with the interrogative clitic =e (=ne after
vowel). It encliticizes to the (clause-final) finite verb or the interrogative
phrase. Content questions are never marked by the interrogative particle m.
   Apart from being flagged with the interrogative clitic =e, content questions
also involve one of the two basic question words or interrogative words fàb
‘where’ (18) or wan ‘who’ (19), which have further semantic extensions into
other epistemic domains (see below):(18)    fàb      un-Ø-eb=e?
        where    go.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
        ‘Where do you go?’(19)    wan-ta                   kàb      le
        who-3SG.M.EMPH            cup      DEM.PROX.SG.N1        klutâ-n-e=ne?
        smash.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
        ‘Who’s broken this cup?’ [TMA questionnaire, 127]Semantically, the two interrogative words almost exactly divide the world up
into animates (wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials
(fàb ‘where, what’), on the other. The only exception to this rule is that wan
plus emphatic pronoun is employed to find out about people’s names, which
are not strictly animate but nonetheless important properties of people.
                                                     10.2. Content questions   391    The interrogative words fàb and wan neither encode number nor gender.
Emphatic pronouns, which can be compounded with both fàb and wan, have
to encode number and in the third person singular also gender. Mian
interrogative words do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites, as interrogatives do for example in Japanese (Nichigauchi 1990)
or in the Australian languages Kayardild (Evans 1995: 365) and Kuuk
Thaayorre (Gaby 2006: 243-244). Both fàb and wan can be used pronominally
and adnominally.
    Content questions in Mian usually have declarative (i.e. falling) intonation,
but can be intonationally marked by a quick rise and subsequent fall of pitch
on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is invariably formed by the
illocutionary particle. This intonational pattern is very similar to the one found
in polar questions.
    The interrogative clitic =e can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to indicate that the speaker assumes that the addressee wants this action
to be performed by the speaker (or by a group to which both speaker and
addressee belong), e.g.:(20)      fàb      o-fâ-n-an=e?
          where    3SG.RESID.O-put.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT =CQ
          ‘Where shall I put it?’ [Observed]Interrogative phrases, which contain the interrogative words fàb and wan,
always appear in situ, i.e. they occur in the same position as non-interrogative
phrases with the same grammatical function (Li and Thompson 1984: 51,
Dryer 2005).
   As in polar and alternative questions, constituent order is not changed with
respect to the corresponding declarative sentence and the interrogative phrase
occupies the position which the queried constituent would have in an
appropriate answer sentence.
   There are a few cases where the interrogative phrase seems to be not in situ
but rather to be postposed after the verb. I will turn to this issue in more detail
below.","[416, 417]"
"This is illustrated for -dum ‘with’ (41) and -dofa ‘about’ (42):

10.2.6.     Fatnàmin plus the nominal postposition dim ‘on’The interrogative word fatnàmin can function as the complement of the
nominal postposition dim ‘on’, yielding fatnàmin dim ta ‘when’, which is
formally a postpositional phrase (see section 7.2 on nominal postpositions like
dim ‘on’ and 7.5 on temporal postpositional phrases):(43)      fatnàmin   dim   -ta          tl-Ø-eb-bu=e?

          ‘When did you come?’
10.2.7.     The interrogative word wanThe interrogative word wan ‘who’ is used to inquire about the identity of
animates including their names.
   There are four variants wan, un and wal, ul. The variation between /wa/
and /u/ is free and can be found in other areas of Mian grammar, e.g. in the
variation of the object agreement prefix wa- ~ u- (see 8.5.3). The variants wal
and ul have the morphophonemic variants wale and ule if the following
emphatic pronoun start in /i/, there is. Thus, the forms for the second and third
person plural are walibta/ulibta ‘who (you PL)’ and walita/ulita ‘who
(they)’, respectively.
   Without an emphatic pronoun, wan only occurs in questions about
possessors. Like possessors expressed by full noun phrases, the interrogative
word wan precedes the possessed. Either the pronominal article =e in the
singular masculine form (44) or =i in the animate plural form (45) is
obligatory:

        ‘Whose (people’s) dog is this?’In questions about the identity of a certain individual wan ‘who’ has to be
compounded with an emphatic pronoun, such as ta ‘he (EMPH)’ (see 3.7.4).
The interrogative clitic =e is used to mark interrogative illocution. When =e
follows the pronoun suffix -ta, this suffix is realized as -t, as in (46) and (47):(46)    bo    wan-bt=e?

        ‘Who built this house?’ [TMA Questionnaire, 128]So far, all instances of wan have been to inquire about the possessor or the
subject. It is also possible to use wan to inquire about the object of a transitive
verb:

       who-SG.M.EMPH        3SG.M.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Who are you looking at?’In ditransitives, content questions about either the recipient (51) or the theme
(52) are possible, but not both in the same clause. The maximal number of
queried constituents is restricted to one:(51)   buk=o         wan-ta
       book=N2       who-SG.M.EMPH       om-ûb’-a-n-eb=e?

       PL.AN.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
       ‘What did you give to the man?’The use of the classificatory prefix dl- ‘plural animate object’ in the last
example does not entail that the referent of the object is animate and plural.
Rather it is used as a default form in content questions about the object, i.e.
when the identity of the object referent is unknown and queried. For inquiring
about inanimate objects, see section 10.2.4 on fatnàmin ‘what’ above.
   The combination wan ‘who’ plus emphatic pronoun is used in a non-verbal
construction to inquire about proper names, which are important properties of
humans and some animals. Example (53) is the idiomatic way of inquiring
about a man’s name. To ask about a woman’s name wanbte has to be used.(53)   kb              ninín=o=le       wan-kbt=e?

       ‘What is your (M) name?’ (lit. ‘As for your (M) name, who
       [are] you (M)?’)Like fàb ‘where’, the interrogative word wan plus an emphatic pronoun can
also be used adnominally as an interrogative modifier. In adnominal position it
means ‘which’:

       ‘Which men are about to come?’ [Danenok]There is one case where the interrogative phrase seemingly does not appear in
situ. Consider the two semantically more or less equivalent utterances. In both
(55) and (56), the speaker wants to know who broke the cup (|| indicates an
intonational break):(55)   wan-ta                kàb         le

       ‘(As for) He who broke the cup, who (is he)?’ [TMA questionnaire,
       127]Compare constituent order in these two examples and also consider the order
in the possible declarative answer in (57), which is parallel in structure to
example (55):(57)   Milsen=e     kàb=e               klutâ-n-e=be
       PN=SG.M      cup(TP)=SG.N1       smash.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Milsen has smashed the cup.’Example (55) above consists of one clause showing the unmarked AOV order.
The interrogative phrase is in subject position (i.e. in situ) and the verb is
marked for interrogative illocution, whereas (56), on the other hand, does not
consist of a finite clause but rather of a topic-comment construction with a
head-internal relative clause in topic position, namely kàb=e klutâ-n-e =le
‘he who broke the cup’, which is marked as a topic with =le, followed by a
juxtaposed comment consisting of the interrogative word and the illocutionary

Embedding
13.0.     IntroductionMian has four types of embedded structure. These are:-   quotative sentences
-   adverbial clauses
-   head-internal relative clauses
-   prenominal relative clausesThese four structures can be distinguished with respect to their syntactic
category and the structures into which they are embedded.
    Quotatives are full sentences, i.e. they receive marking for illocutionary
force, e.g. =bo for quotatives, =a for embedded polar questions, =e for
embedded content questions, or =e ~ =o ‘hortative’. These are always
embedded as sentential complements of the function verb ge/ga ‘say’.
    Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses display clausal syntax
but are formally marked as noun phrases, i.e. they occur with a proper subset
of the determiners which fill the determiner slot in ordinary noun phrases. It is
quite typical for Papuan languages to treat adverbials and relatives formally
the same, the functional reason for this being that both types of clause provide
background information (Foley 1986: 202).
    Prenominal relative clauses are embedded within noun phrases. They do
not receive any overt marking. There is no subordinator, determiner and no
illocutionary marking.
    Embedded structures are on a different syntactic level with respect to their
matrix clauses because in complex sentences, embedded clauses are skipped
by the switch reference (S/R) morphology operating in the main clause, i.e.
S/R is calculated with respect to the next clause after the embedded structure.
    Verbs in simple embedded clauses are morphologically very similar to
independent sentence-final verbs, e.g. both the former and the latter can be
inflected for irrealis mood whereas medial verbs cannot. All embedded
structures can be complex themselves. They can consist of a clause chain
themselves. In such cases, the last clause has a final verb and all clauses in the
embedded chain have medial verbs with S/R morphology pertaining only to
subject tracking and to the temporal structure of the events in the embedded
clause chain. In other words, S/R morphology only tracks subjects across
486       13. Embeddingclauses on the same syntactic level. Subject-tracking never reaches into
embedded clauses or out of embedded clauses into the matrix clause.
   Verbs in embedded quotatives are always fully independent of any
information marked on the final verb in the matrix clause. Verbs in embedded
adverbials and relative clauses are only minimally dependent on the matrix
verb in that it always has to have the same illocutionary force value. This
dependency is familiar from clause chains. Unlike medial clauses, however,
verbs in embedded adverbial and relative clauses have their own TAM value
and are independent of any negation on the matrix verb, as shown in (1).
Adverbial clauses are “impervious to denial from such following clauses”
(Haiman 1980: 142), e.g.:(1)       bomânomo        balubib=e        aai=e
          tomorrow        airstrip=SG.N1   water=SG.N1          êi-n-em-e=o
          accumulate-AUX.PFV-COND-3SG.N1.SBJ=N2          balu=e=mo                tl-aamab-e=ba=be
          plane=SG.N1=NEG          come.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ=NEG=DECL
          ‘If tomorrow the airstrip accumulates water, the plane won’t come.’Habitual marking likewise never extends to an adverbial clause. The hitting of
cats cannot be interpreted as habitual in (2):(2)       kbo        busi   i-nâ’-n-em-eb=o
          2SG.M       cat    PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-AUX.PFV-COND-2SG.SBJ=N2                     meou        ga-bina-b-io=be

13.1.       Embedded quotatives13.1.1.     Quotatives as sentential complementsQuotative sentences are used to represent discourse. They are always
embedded as sentential complements of the function verb ge/ga ‘say’. Verbs
in simple embedded quotative sentences display final verb morphology and
either take a clitic =bo ‘Quotative’, as in (3), or have a hortative verb form

illustrated by the examples (3) to (7). This ‘introductory’ medial clause is not
obligatory and can be left out without creating a difference in meaning. The

11.1.4.     The morphological status of the auxiliaryThe question about the morphological status of the auxiliary is less
straightforward than it might appear in section 8.6.7, where I state that verb
forms like those in (23) are auxiliary-serialized forms consisting of a lexical
verb stem with any argument-indexing affixes followed by an auxiliary, e.g.:(23)      két=e
          container=SG.N1          a-fû’-bi-n-e-so=be
          3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ-HPST=DECL
          ‘I was holding the container yesterday.’For a description of the forms of the existential verb with the function of an
auxiliary, see section 8.6.7 for final verbs and section 11.2.5 for medial verbs.
Such verb-auxiliary sequences have the following properties:-     They are realized as a single phonological word, but there is no fusion
      of the verbs and the auxiliary stem.
-     Aspect of the main verb and the auxiliary can be at variance.

phrase and means ‘which’ rather than ‘where’, e.g.:(26)   am=o         fàb       áa un-omab-bio=ne?

394       10. Question formation10.2.3.     fatnà- ‘do what?’This is an interrogative pro-verb (Hagège 2008) consisting of the interrogative
word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’. Fatnà ‘do what?’ can be inflected as a
verb and has the meaning ‘do what’:(27)      fatnà-b-eb=e?
          do_what-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=CQ
          ‘What are you doing?’ [Observed]There is a case to be made that fatnà is best analysed as an interrogative pro-
verb, i.e. as a single root which contains both a verbal and an interrogative
meaning. Such interrogative pro-verbs can be found in Papuan languages, e.g.
Kuot (Lindström 2002), Austronesian languages, e.g. Paamese (Crowley
1982) and Australian languages, e.g. Kayardild (Evans 1995: 371-372) and
Dyirbal (Dixon 1972). Outside the Pacific area, interrogative verbs can for
example be found in West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) (Sadock 1984: 206).
   In Paamese, there is an intransitive monomorphemic interrogative verb
kosaa ‘do what’, which is not segmentable into an interrogative and a verbal
element (Crowley 1982: 159).
   For Kayardild, Evans (1995: 371) analyses the pro-verb ngaakawatha ‘do
what’ as an inchoative form of the interrogative word ngaaka ‘what/who’.
Here, the pro-verb is derived from an interrogative word with the suffix
-watha which derives verbs from nominals (Evans 1995: 282).
   The degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal element in
fatnà is relatively low. The interrogative word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’
can still clearly be discerned. /b/ goes to [t] before the alveolar nasal /n/. This
form of place assimilation applies across the board in Mian and is thus not
necessarily indicative of a beginning fusion between the interrogative and the
verb stem.
   On the other hand, there is a semantic shift of the interrogative word fàb
from ‘where’ to ‘what’ in fatnà. Bare fàb cannot mean ‘what’, while fatnà
cannot mean ‘do where’. It contrasts with fàb na ‘do where’. As the meaning
of fàb is clearly construction-specific here, the meaning of fatnà cannot be
said to be fully transparent anymore. Also, the [t] in the interrogative verb
ftna is often elided in normal and fast speech to yield fanà ‘do what’. I
therefore analyse fatnà as an interrogative pro-verb, albeit one with a low
degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal part.
   The core meaning of fatnà is ‘do what’:(28)      n      ul        lo                 dowôn’-aam-i=o

is closer to ‘why’, as in (29) or ‘how’, as in (30):(29)                  fanà-n-o=ta

       ‘How has he escaped me?’ [Klebein]
       (lit. ‘What has he done, has he gone on me?’)The last two examples also shed some light on the syntactic and
morphological behaviour of fatnà in content questions.
   First, these forms function as verbs and are heads of their own clauses as
can be seen in (29), which consists of a medial clause  fatnànota and a final
clause besao mebone. This is captured in the literal translations above. Like
medial verbs, inflected fatnà is subject to the usual inflectional restrictions for
medial verbs, namely that they cannot be marked for polarity or for irrealis or
deontic mood.
   Second, the bare stem fatnà can appear in shortened medial clauses under
subject identity as in (30). If the verb in the following clause has the same
subject, Mian medial verbs can be shortened to just the stem which is marked
as a medial verb by the clitic =ta (see 11.2.13).
   Therefore, fatnà ‘do what’ is a morphologically and syntactically regular
verb in many respects. It can also form hortative verb forms (31) and appear in
purposive serializations (32):(31)    fatnà-n-an=e?

10.2.4.     The verbal noun fatnàmin ‘what’The interrogative word fatnàmin has the basic meaning ‘what’. As an isolated
utterance, fatnàmin is interpreted as ‘what’, ‘why’, or ‘how’. Unlike a
question with bare fàb, a question with fatnàmin can optionally be marked
with the content question clitic =e:(33)      fatnàmin?/ fatnàmin=e?    ‘What (is it)?’/‘Why (is it)?’/‘How (is it)?’If fatnàmin appears in an argument position of a verb, as in (34), i.e. in the
position the argument constituent will have in an appropriate answer sentence,
as in (35), it means ‘what’:(34)      Q:    kbo      fatnàmin dowôn’-aamab-eb=e?

                ‘I want to eat pork.’As no interrogative containing fàb can ever be used to inquire about animates,
the argument position fatnàmin occupies is usually that of the object of the
verb.
   Inanimate subjects of the (intransitive) existential verb n/bi~bl, can be
queried by using fatnàmin:(36)      Q:    fatnàmin y      bi-Ø-e=ne?
                what       there stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=CQ
                ‘What is there?’(37)      A:     imen=e            y      bi-Ø-e=be
                 taro=SG.N1        there stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=DECL
                 ‘There is a taro (tuber).’In its adnominal use fatnàmin precedes the noun phrase and means either
‘what kind of’ or ‘how many’. Thus, the questions in (38) and (39) below are
                                                      10.2. Content questions     397ambiguous as to whether the speaker requests information about quality, i.e.
‘what kind of’, or quantity, i.e. ‘how many’. Generally, the context has to
disambiguate:(38)      fatnàmin lais         sm bi-Ø-e=ne?
          what     rice(TP) still stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=CQ
          ‘How much rice is still there?’ But also: ‘What kind of rice is still
          there?’(39)               fatnàmin   am        ge-n-e-bu=e?
          3SG.M     what       house     build.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ-GPST=CQ
          ‘What kind of house did he build?’ But also: ‘How many houses did
          he build?’In order to unambiguously express that they are interested to learn about
quantity and not quality or kind, younger speakers tend to use fatnàmin-fela
for ‘how much/many’. This construction is calqued from Tok Pisin hamaspela
‘how much/many’:(40)      fatnàmin-fela    tablaséb  unáng=i                wat
          how_many         white_man woman=PL.AN            there_across          bl-Ø-ib=e?
          stay.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=CQ
          ‘How many white women are over there?’ [Observed]Inquiring about quantities was presumably not a common activity in a society
which only had three basic numerals and by combining them counted to
around six or seven. Larger quantities were designated as ‘many’. I assume
that the meaning ‘how many’ for fatnàmin developed as a secondary sense
from ‘what, what kind of’.","[418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423]"
"
10.3.       Topic-only questionsTopic-only questions are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is given,
as in English What about John? or And you? The speaker has a particular
question in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied
question is, normally something that would have been asked immediately
before about a different discourse participant or something that was
anticipated by a statement, such as I’m going. What about you? (Implied: Are
you going as well?). In Mian topic-only questions are formed by using a free
pronoun or noun phrase and the low-toned topic clitic =le. In the examples
below, possible implied questions are given in brackets. If context is lacking
the default interpretation of a topic-only question would be about the topic’s
whereabouts:(58)      bo=le?
          2SG.F=TOP
          ‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
          ‘What do you want to eat?’)
                                               10.3. Topic-only questions   403(59)   Leoni    =le?
       PN       3SG.F=TOP
       ‘What about Leoni?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Leoni doing?’,
       ‘Where is Leoni?’)Topic-only questions are a special case because they do not display any of the
usual strategies to mark an utterance as a question in Mian. As can be seen
from the two examples above, there are no interrogative words nor do any
interrogative particles occur.
    I assume that there are two reasons why (58) and (59) are readily
interpreted as topic-only questions though they do not bear any of the markers
typical of questions in Mian: (a) they have their own distinctive intonational
contour, namely a level high pitch on the topic marker =le which is almost as
high as the H on the preceding vowel and (b) as a matter of convention, any
utterance of the structure NP=TOP is interpreted as a topic-only question.
Chapter 11
Chaining constructions
11.0.    IntroductionThis chapter deals with two different types of chaining construction, both of
which are highly frequent in Mian discourse. The first type is verb
serialization where two or more verb stems are concatenated to form a
sequence of predicates within a single clause. Within serial verb constructions,
I distinguish between core and nuclear (or ‘tight’) serializations. The second
type of chaining construction is clause chaining where two or more clauses are
chained together to form a sentence.
   These two construction types have in common that they are essentially
coordinate (i.e. not subordinate or embedded) structures and that their last
constituent carries grammatical information, such as illocutionary force and
polarity, which has scope over the entire construction. This form of
dependency relation in serial verb constructions and clause chains is also
called co-subordination in the literature (Reesink 1983, Foley and Van Valin
1984). A succinct definition of co-subordination can be found in Reesink
(1983: 224-226): “[Co-subordination] refers to a process whereby two items
are coordinated into a new whole with operators applying to this new whole
rather than to one of the conjuncts.” The scope rules of operators in clause
chains will be taken up in detail in chapter 12.","[428, 429, 430, 431]"
"
11.5.        Medial verbs in utterance-final positionIt is quite a common phenomenon for Mian medial verbs to appear utterance-
finally in natural discourse. However, such utterances are usually not taken to
be grammatically complete sentences (Reesink 1987: 87). Their verbs are
clearly medial and not final because they are not interpreted with respect to
the moment of speaking (as final verbs are) but rather with respect to some
subsequent event which is not mentioned but implied or understood, since it is
obvious to the addressee from the context established by the situation in which
the utterance was made (Reesink 1983: 225).
    Although clause chains do not involve subordination (in the sense of
embedding) but rather co-subordination, the phenomenon under discussion
here is comparable to the widespread use of subordinate constructions as main
clauses in the world’s languages with particular semantic or discourse effects
(Evans 2007).
    Note that medial verbs in utterance-final position always take the medial
verb marker =ta rather than =a. An example is provided in (124):(124) n       sít=o            fubâ-n-i=ta
      1SG      tooth=PL.N1 wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘I’ll brush my teeth first and then I’ll …’ [Observed]Medial clauses as independent utterances are invariably understood as
desiderative statements about the future. Examples like (124) are abbreviated
468    11. Chaining constructionsversions of a full clause chain ending in a final verb inflected for irrealis. A
possible example is (125):(125) n        sít=o               fubâ-n-i=ta
      1SG       tooth=PL.N1         wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED       áam          un-aamab-i=be
       lie.SG.SBJ go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I’ll brush my teeth and then go to bed.’A clause with a medial verb in final position, such as n sít=o fubâ-n-i=ta in
(124) above cannot be construed to mean: *‘I have brushed my teeth’, for
which an independent sentence has to be employed, as in (126):(126) n      sít=o            fubâ-Ø-i-o=be
      1SG     tooth=PL.N1      wash-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
      ‘I’ve brushed my teeth.’In (126), the final verb fubâiobe ‘I’ve washed (it)’ is zero-marked for realis
mood. As there is no alternative temporal reference point indicated, the default
interpretation is that the action took place immediately before the moment of
speaking.
    Another reason why utterance-final verbs in examples such as (124) above
should be treated as medial and not as final verbs is that the markers in the
pre-subject slot are interpreted as S/R markers. The S/R system limits the set
of available subjects for the implied event. For instance, the medial verb in
(124) fubânita is inflected with -n ‘SS.SEQ’. As the subject is first person
singular, the subject of the implied event must be coreferential. In all other
person-number combinations, -n only indicates sequentiality of events (127):(127) funa-n-eb=ta
      think.PFV-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘You think first and then (anybody)…’In the next example the medial verb is marked for DS. Consequently, the
subject of the implied event must be disjoint (regardless of person and number
specification of the subject):(128) aai=e            dowôn’-s-eb=ta
      water=SG.N1      eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘You’ll drink water first and then someone else will…’
                                   11.6. Non-verbal clauses in clause chains   469It is possible for utterance-final medial verbs to also take one of the
illocutionary particles =be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble
‘Exclamative’, =a ‘Question’, or =e ‘(Content) Question’ (which normally
only occur on final verbs) in addition to the medial verb clitic =ta. Again,
such structures are not grammatically complete utterances but imply an event
which must be readily retrievable from the linguistic or extra-linguistic
context. Examples (129) and (130) illustrate this for a declarative and an
interrogative sentence, respectively:(129) fanin-wal=i              wengsâng
      ancestor-PL=PL.AN        story        baa-n-ang-ge-n-i=ta=be
        say.PFV-REAL-IMMACC.SG.SBJ-say.PFV-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED=DECL
        ‘I am about to tell an ancestor story.’ (Implied: ‘and I will tell it
        now’)(130) sít=o           fubâ-n-eb=t=ya?
      tooth=PL.N1     wash-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED=Q
      ‘Will you brush your teeth first?’ (Implied, e.g. ‘and then go to bed’)
11.6.     Non-verbal clauses in clause chainsMost often the predicate of a non-verbal clause is followed by an illocutionary
particle which marks the end of independent and grammatically complete
utterance. However, non-verbal clauses also occur in clause chaining
constructions without an illocutionary clitic. Two examples are provided in
(131) and (132):(131) Kasening Milimab        n-ta            wengsâng       lo
        PN                    1SG-EMPH         story          DEM.PROX.N2        om-êb=wt

      ‘because (his, i.e. a child’s) liver, lungs, and heart were open and he
      was panting, …’ [Crows]Quite commonly, non-verbal clauses in clause chains are followed by the
conjunction kesoa ‘because’:(133) nái         -ta             kesoa

Chapter 12
Operator scope in clause chaining constructions
12.0.      IntroductionGrammatically marked categories such as tense, mood, polarity, illocutionary
force and the like, called operators by Foley and Van Valin (1984) and Foley
and Olsen (1985), differ in the scope they have in clause chaining structures.
The final verb is usually marked for such categories whereas the medial verbs
in the same clause chain depend on some of this information. While medial
verbs encode sequentiality or simultaneity of events and switches in subject
reference, they rely on final verbs for information on temporal location, mood,
and illocutionary force of the events denoted by the medial verbs. This is
typical for co-subordinated structures, such as clause chains (Reesink 1983,
Foley and Van Valin 1984).
    In this chapter, all operators that occur in final verbs in clause chaining
constructions and the scope they have over the clause chain will be examined
in some detail. The operators are ordered according to categories:        Illocutionary force   =be                ‘Declarative’
                              =ble               ‘Exclamative’
                              =bo                ‘Quotative, emphatic’
                              =a                 ‘Question’
                              =e                 ‘(Content) Question’
                              =o ~ =e            ‘Hortative’
        Polarity              =ba                ‘Negation’
        Tense1                -bio               ‘General past’
                              -so                ‘Hesternal past’
                              -b(H)              ‘Non-hodiernal past’
                              -s                 ‘Remote past’
        Mood                  -n                 ‘Realis’
                              -(a)mab/-omab      ‘Irrealis’
                              -(V)m              ‘Deontic’
        Aspect                -b, -l             ‘Imperfective’
                              -m                 ‘Inchoative imperfective’
        Habituality           bina               ‘Habitual’
472     12. Operator scope in clause chaining constructionsOf these, illocutionary force, polarity, and tense always have full scope, mood
and habituality can have full scope but do not have to, and aspect finally is a
local phenomenon that never has scope.","[493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498]"

Acknowledgements
The present volume is the heavily revised version of my doctoral dissertation
“A grammar of Mian, a Papuan language of New Guinea”. It is wider in scope
and also tries to get rid of the rough edges of the dissertation. Since my days
as a Ph.D. student I have been back to the field for two more months
expanding the corpus and tying up loose ends in the analysis. This larger
corpus, the critical and helpful comments of the external reviewers, as well as
two years of turning over various issues of Mian grammar in my mind, helped
me to develop a clearer view of many of these issues. I would like to sincerely
thank the following people and institutions for providing help and support
during my Ph.D. and while revising the material and preparing it for
publication. All mistakes are, of course, my own.
    A great debt of gratitude is owed to the people of the Mianmin
communities in Mianmin and Yapsiei for sharing their language, culture and
lives with me during my stay in Papua New Guinea. In particular, thanks to
the whole Milimab family, especially to Kasening Milimab, for great patience
and interest in this project and for taking me in as one of the family.
    Special thanks go to my language consultants: Kasening Milimab, who had
an immense knowledge and was very concerned that I learn Mian properly,
Asuneng Amit, who had the gift of telling wonderful stories and the patience
for paradigm elicitation, Liden Milimab, whose superb command of English
was helpful in many ways, and Raymond Davai, who taught me basic Mian
tonology by indicating pitch movements with hand gestures, after it had turned
out that the method of having speakers whistle the tones failed. Thanks also to
Beitab Fenobi and Ibalim Soubgena, from whom I was able to record
historical accounts and descriptions of traditional Mianmin initiation rituals
and to Umsin Milimab, Wentak Yung, Awaseb Oblib, Ms. Selem Kasening,
Milsen (aka Mandat) Milimab, Eron Yung, Davai Milimab, Wils Tloniab,
Stanley Ebtem, Headmaster Nontlin Dab, Ray Waniab from MAF in Tabubil,
Jeremiah (aka Vagi) Yung, Ebel Yangsin, Aiben, and the pastors Uneyab and
Maikas.
    I am grateful to my supervisors Nick Evans and Rachel Nordlinger for
steady guidance and support throughout the Ph.D. project.
    Thanks to Nick for always challenging me intellectually in our supervision
meetings, for never being satisfied with the second best, but also for steady
encouragement along the way. He not only made me be critical towards my
work and sharpen my analyses of Mian linguistic structure but also made me
aware how important it is to have the reader in mind when writing a grammar.
vi   AcknowledgementsThanks also for many valuable tips concerning fieldwork and equipment
(especially the ‘dead-dog’ bag to keep things dry).
    Thanks to Rachel, who was always there for spontaneous meetings, in
which we discussed various topics of my thesis and brought some sense into
the complex Mian verb morphology. Also for being a great moral support
throughout the time of my Ph.D.
    I thank the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen for
enabling me to continue my work on this grammar while being a postdoc in
the Language and Cognition Group, and the Arts and Humanities Research
Council (UK) for giving me the opportunity to continue my work and finish
this grammar while working on the ESF EuroBabel project “Alor-Pantar
languages: origin and theoretical impact” (AH/H500251/1).
    The fieldwork I have conducted during my time as a Ph.D. student (in 2004
and 2005) was funded by the Arts Faculty of the University of Melbourne and
the ARC Discovery Project “Reciprocals across languages”. The last field trip
(in 2008) was funded by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in
Nijmegen. I thank these bodies for their financial support.
    I wrote the revised version of my thesis presented in this volume as a
postdoctoral fellow at the MPI for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen and in the
Surrey Morphology Group at the University of Surrey. I thank Steve Levinson
and Grev Corbett, respectively, for their help and support.
    Special thanks go to Don Gardner who first got me interested in working
on Mian. Don has been working as an anthropologist with the West Mianmin
for the last 30 years and I was lucky to be able to profit from his knowledge
and connections in Papua New Guinea. Don accompanied me on my first trip
for a couple of weeks, introduced me to the people and was generally an
invaluable help for me to adjust to the unfamiliar environment.
    The first one and a half months of my first field trip I spent in Yapsiei
station. I would like to thank Tesinab Balabe, with whom I worked there, and
Atupe, Father Ben and Father Albino of the Yapsiei mission station, Milan
Janda, who was researching moths in the area and who let me use his satellite
phone, and the kiap of Telefomin District Ricky Yentop Yaman.
    Further, I thank the National Research Institute of Papua New Guinea in
Port Moresby, especially Jim Robins, and the Provincial Government of
Sandaun Province in Vanimo, especially Eugene Raire and Ignatius Litiki.
    I thank Bernard Comrie and Bill Foley, the examiners of my dissertation,
for many critical comments and helpful suggestions which I incorporated into
the present book.
    Matthew Dryer, the cognizant editor for the Mouton Grammar Library,
closely read the whole manuscript. I am very grateful for his insightful
comments which made me change many aspects of the description and the
analysis and which thus greatly improved the quality of the grammar.

The language and its speakers
1.0.     IntroductionThe term Mian is not a native Mian word. Nevertheless, it is nowadays used as
an ethnonym and a logonym and as a toponym for the airstrip near the
Mianmin settlements Timeilmin and Temsakmin. Traditionally, the Mianmin
had no term for their people but used group or clan names which were
compounded with the nominal stem tn ‘people’, e.g. Usalei-tn and Kmeil-
tn, denoting the Mian clans who today live in the settlements Gubil and
Timeilmin, respectively.
    The noun mian means ‘dog’ in the related Ok languages Faiwol and Bimin
(Healey 1964a: 85) and in the distantly related Oksapmin language (Lawrence
1972a, Lawrence 1972b, Loughnane 2009). The story goes that when a patrol
came to Telefomin District in the mid 1930s and asked for information about
the people living towards the north and west of the Telefomin area, who
afterwards became known as the Mianmin, they learned the name ‘Mian’,
possibly because the Mianmin had a reputation as fierce warriors. This name
subsequently became the standard designation for the people under the
colonial administration and later was adopted by the Mianmin people
themselves. The Oksapmin know a mythical story of how the Mianmin got
their name. Near Oksapmin station there is a rock face amidst the rain forest
covering the steep wall of a mountain ridge. According to Oksapmin myth,
that was the place where a bitch gave birth to the first Mianmin in days of
yore. From there, they moved westward into lower altitude regions, into the
traditional and contemporary Mianmin area.1
    Linguists of the Summer Institute of Linguistics generally used the terms
‘Mianmin’ or ‘Oksapmin’ both as ethnonyms and language names. This
terminology gained wider currency through the classic literature on Papuan
languages (Wurm 1982, Foley 1986). Originally, the Mianmin called their
language wéng, which polysemously means ‘sound, voice, speech, language’.
Nowadays, they use Mian wéng ‘Mian language’. Most names of inhabited
places are compounds ending in am ‘house’, such as Mian-am ‘Mianmin’,
Temsel-am ‘Temsakmin’, Klefol-am ‘Telefomin’, Oksab-am ‘Oksapmin’ or in
bib ‘village, hamlet, place’, e.g. Kondu-bib, Skio-bib. I will use the term
‘Mian’ for the language (as an abbreviation of Mian wéng) and ‘Mianmin’ as
the ethnonym and as the toponym signifying the area around Mianmin airstrip.
2      1. The language and its speakers1.1.        Mian wéng: The Mian languageMian (also known as ‘Mianmin’ or ‘Miyanmin’ in the literature, ISO mpt) is a
Papuan language of the Ok family. The term ‘Papuan’ is not to be understood
as a name for a well-defined language family but as a residue category for the
non-Austronesian and non-Australian languages of the south-west Pacific
(Foley 1986, 2000).
   The Ok family of languages belongs to the larger Trans New Guinea
(TNG) family, and is of roughly the same order of internal diversification as
Germanic within Indo-European (Healey 1964a, Wurm 1982, Pawley 2005).
The Ok languages are named after the widespread cognate ok ‘river, water’ in
these languages.2 Mian is spoken by fewer than two thousand people in the
north-west of Telefomin District in Sandaun Province, Papua New Guinea.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

9.11.     Non-verbal clausesNon-verbal clauses are topic-comment constructions consisting of a non-finite
predicate (the comment) and exactly one argument (the topic). The predicate
is followed by the predicator =o. The topic is non-obligatory and thus can be
left out if its identity is obvious or retrievable from the linguistic or extra-
linguistic context. Non-verbal predicates always are one-place predicates and
can consist of a pronoun or noun (including proper names and verbal nouns),
an adjective, or an adverb.
    Like clauses with finite verbs, non-verbal clauses are marked for
illocutionary force. The range of illocutionary markers, however, is slightly
more restricted since non-verbal predications cannot be hortatives. One finds
=be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble ‘Exclamative’, =a
‘Question’ and =e ‘(Content) Question’. For interrogatory non-verbal
predications, see 10.1.1.
    An example of a declarative non-verbal predication is:(118) Iliba=e       tíl=o=be
      PN=SG.M       dog=PRD=DECL
      ‘Iliba is a dog.’Any noun phrase is permitted as the topic argument. This noun phrase can
consist of a free or inflected pronoun or a headless adjective. If the identity of
the referent of the topic noun phrase is obvious it is commonly left out:(119) tíl=o=be
      dog=PRD=DECL
      ‘It’s a dog.’The reader should note that the pronoun ‘it’ in the free translation is not meant
to be taken as referential. ‘It’ does not refer to any entity which happens to be
a dog. Nothing in the Mian utterance tíl=o=be actually refers to the entity
about which the predication is made.
   There is no predicator in questions:
372       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(120) tíl=a?
      dog=Q
      ‘Is it a dog?’If the predicate term ends in a vowel the predicator =o is usually left out, even
in non-interrogatory contexts. However, occasionally =o is put in even under
these circumstances. Compare more frequent (121) and less frequent (122)
with the same meaning:(121) naka=be
      man=DECL
      ‘It is a man.’(122) naka=o=be
      man=PRD=DECL
      ‘It is a man.’
9.11.1.     IdentityNon-verbal predications express more or less permanent states, as opposed to
temporary ones. They are commonly used to state the identity of some
referent:(123) n         Bikene=i      unáng=o=bo
      1SG        PN=PL.AN      woman=PRD=QUOT          ge        baa-s-o=a
          say.PFV say.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘ “I am a woman of the Bikene (people)” she said, and then someone
          else…’ [Dimosson]The following example (124) illustrates the reversed order of the topic and the
comment, see ungrammatical (125), if the predicate term is a proper name, kin
noun, or dyad (when the predication is about identity). In this case the topic
has to be an emphatic pronoun, compare grammatical (124) with
ungrammatical (126):(124) Kasening        n-ta=be
          PN          1SG-EMPH=DECL
          ‘I’m Kasening.’
                                                  9.11. Non-verbal clauses   373(125) *n    Kasening=o=be
      1SG    PN=PRD=DECL
      Intended: ‘I’m Kasening.’(126) *Kasening           n=be
          PN              1SG=DECL
          Intended: ‘I’m Kasening.’
9.11.2.    PropertyAnother common function of non-verbal predications is to predicate certain
properties of a referent:(127) ngáamein=o=be
      yellow=PRD=DECL
      ‘It is yellow.’(128) ninín     Sofelok lo          sino      awém=o=be
      name      PN       DEM.N2      before taboo=PRD=DECL
      ‘Before, this name Sofelok was taboo.’ [Sofelok, 2]In non-verbal predications which designate properties one also finds a variant
which involves =na ‘too’ which is possibly derived from the verb stem na
‘do’. The meaning is that the topic argument – apart from other potential
properties – also has the property predicated about it by the predicate term.
This construction can be used only with adjectives:(129) wan     le                      ilem=na=be
      bird    DEM.PROX.SG.M            red=too=DECL
      ‘This bird is also red (in addition to some other colour(s)).’(130) as=e             milil     eka teke=na=be
      tree=SG.N1       black     and long=too=DECL
      ‘The tree is black and also tall.’Although =na might have originated in the verb na, it cannot be inflected in
property predications. Therefore, I treat this construction as non-verbal.
374       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause9.11.3.     PossessionNon-verbal predications can be used to indicate possession. In non-verbal
possessive constructions, the predicate can be a possessive pronoun with
nominal function, e.g. nmi ‘mine’, kbmi ‘yours’ and nlemi ‘mine alone’,
kelebmî ‘yours alone’, etc., as in (131) with a topic term and in (132) without
one:(131) táang      le                         nmi=be
      flint      DEM.PROX.SG.N1              mine=DECL
      ‘This lighter is mine.’(132) nmi=be
      mine=DECL
      ‘It is mine.’An alternative way of expressing possession with a non-verbal clause is to
inflect a noun with -sa ‘with’ as the predicate term, as in (133) and (134):(133) unáng=o          amún-sa=be
      woman=SG.F       belly-with=DECL
      ‘The woman is pregnant.’ (lit. ‘is with belly’)(134) n      am-sa=be
      1SG     house-with=DECL
      ‘I have a house.’ (lit. ‘am with house’)On attributive possession, see section 6.5. On derivational suffixes on nouns,
see 3.1.5.","[397, 398, 399, 400]"
"
2.5.2.      The verb -lò ‘hit, kill’This verb is realized as -l before any vowel. This specific context arises when
the verb is compounded with a vowel-initial second stem (47) or when
followed by a vowel initial subject suffix (48). The lexical tone HL on -lò is

2.5.3.      The article =i ‘Animate plural’The clitic article =i is realized as =ei after a word ending in a high vowel /i/ or
/u/, e.g. snbi ‘crocodile’ and snbi=ei ‘(the) crocodiles’; umasou ‘umasou
fish (species)’ and umasou=ei ‘(the) umasou fish (PL)’.

‘second/third person plural animate subject’, are realized as -ei and -eib(o),
respectively, whenever they attach to a stem ending in a high vowel /i/ or /u/,
such as ki ‘align, read’ or fu ‘cook’. Thus, the correct forms are kieibiobe (49)

example:(54)      naka=ya?
          man=Q
          ‘Is it a man?’The illocutionary clitic =e ‘(Content) Question’ is realized as =ne after vowel,

2.6.        Phonotactics2.6.1.      Syllable structureSyllable structure can be represented as follows: (C1)(C2)V(C3). This means
that Mian allows the following six syllable types: V, CV, VC, CVC, CCV, and
CCVC. Apart from these regular patterns, there is the structure VCC, which is
attested in only one native word so far, /Hans/ ‘song’. The tendency of some
speakers to nasalize the vowel and pronounce this word as [ãs]  indicates that
this syllable type is highly uncommon and therefore readily transformed into
the regular VC pattern. CVCC syllable structure is attested in a limited
number of Tok Pisin loans, e.g. /HLboks/ ‘box’, though often pronounced
[bkìs] with an epenthetic [i], and /Ltons/ ‘tongs’, though sometimes
pronounced [tõs] with a nasalized vowel by older speakers.

   Far from all logically possible combinations are attested. The rule is that /s/
in C1 position can precede all consonants which are allowed in the C2 position

3.7.11.   InterrogativesMian has two interrogative words: wan ‘who’ and fàb ‘where, what’.
Semantically, the two interrogative words divide the world up into animates
(wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials (fàb ‘where,
what’), on the other. Interrogative words do not encode the categories number
and gender. They do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites. Both wan and fàb can be used pronominally and adnominally. For
details on the form and the use of wan and fàb, see section 10.2 on
interrogative words and the formation of content question.","[164, 165]"
"
11.1.2.     Nuclear serial verb constructionsNuclear SVCs have a more tightly-knit structure than core SVCs. They consist
of maximally two stems. No material can intervene between the two stems of
a nuclear SVC but the component verbs are realized as phonologically
independent words and each verb constitutes its own domain with respect to
tone assignment.
    While core SVCs allow the component verbs to have their own objects this
is not permitted in nuclear SVCs. If the whole SVC is transitive it has a single
object. The stem aspect value of the component verbs must not be at variance.
While it is possible for either stem to be trans-aspectual, it is impossible that
one is perfective and the other imperfective. In many cases the constituent
stems of a nuclear SVC do not occur on their own and they are therefore
difficult to gloss. I therefore gloss nuclear SVCs as a whole.
    An example of a nuclear SVC is given in (18):(18)      Aalei    awél=i              =le

nuclear SVCs is provided in table 11.1. Verbs which only occur in a nuclear
SVC and whose meaning is therefore difficult to give, are glossed with a
question mark. When the gloss of a component verb is doubtful it is preceded
by a question mark.","[438, 439]"
"2.6.4.     Vowel clustersMian has a plethora of different vowel clusters, most of which appear ‘post-
morphologically’ due to morpheme concatenation. Like vowel clusters are not
permitted. In some cases, like vowels are fused into a single vowel of normal
length, sometimes allomorphy is triggered.
   Unlike the diphthongs, which are only rising, vowel clusters can be
centring. Vowel clusters which result from morpheme concatenation are
always heterosyllabic in careful speech. Table 2.7 sets out all permissible
heterosyllabic vowel clusters. Cells marked with an asterisk are not
permissible. In two cases allomorphy is triggered (see below).
   A few selected examples are given below. The vowel clusters appear in
boldface:(62)     biebe       /Lbib/          [mbi..]       ‘he is there’

sequences, e.g. the subject suffixes which begin in /i/, these are -i ‘first
singular subject’ and -ib(o) ‘second/third person plural animate subject’, are
realized as -ei and -eib(o), respectively, if they attach to a stem ending in a
high vowel, such as ki ‘align, read’ or fu ‘cook’. Thus, kieibiobe ‘I read’ and
fueibbiobe ‘you(PL)/they cooked’. Similarly, the animate plural article =i is
realized as =ei after /i/ or /u/, e.g. /Hsnabi/ ‘crocodile’ and /Hsnabi=i/ ‘(the)
crocodiles’; /Lumasou/ ‘fish species’ and /umasou=i/ ‘(the) umasou fish’.
   In fast(er) speech, high and mid vowels as first members of vowel clusters,
that is all vowels except /a/ and /a/, lose their syllabicity and become glides.","[69, 70]"

12.1.     Illocutionary forceOnly final verbs can be marked for illocutionary force. The set of illocutionary
markers consists of the clitics =be ‘Declarative’, =ble ‘Exclamative’, =bo
‘Quotative, emphatic’, =a ‘Question’, =e ‘(Content) Question’, and =o ~ =e
‘Hortative’. All of these have scope over the whole clause chain, e.g.:(1)                bín=o        we-n-e=a
        3SG.M       floor=N2     sweep-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED        unín=o       fu-n-e=be
        food=N2      cook-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He swept the floor and then cooked food.’In (1) the illocutionary particle =be marks the whole clause chain as
declarative. The first clause cannot be interpreted as having a different
illocutionary value, for instance, to construe it as a question: *‘Did he sweep
the floor?’ is impossible. Note though that the first clause on its own could
indeed be a question,2 provided it has the appropriate interrogative intonation:(2)              bín=o        we-n-e=a?
        3SG.M     floor=N2 sweep-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
        ‘Has he swept the floor?’Nonetheless, in (1) above an interrogative reading of the first clause is
impossible due to the scope of the marker of declarative illocutionary force on
the final verb.
   The same holds for the illocutionary markers =ble ‘Exclamative’ in (3),
and =bo ‘Quotative, emphatic’ in (4):(3)     wan     tiam=i            sangwân te-n-ib=a

       ‘ “I smashed her nose, so she died, so I put her down here”, she said
       and then someone else…’ [Afoksitgabáam]The illocutionary clitic =ble indicates that the whole of (3) is an exclamation
and =bo in (4) likewise expresses that all preceding medial clauses are
quotative, i.e. they represent what the woman said at that point in the story. On
quotatives as embedded structures, see 13.1.
   Markers of interrogative and hortative illocutionary force obey the same
scope rules. In order to turn the wohle of (1) above into a question, one can
replace =be ‘Declarative’ with =a to indicate a polar question:(5)               bín=o        we-n-e=a

       ‘Has he swept the floor and cooked food?’
       *‘He has swept the floor, and has he cooked food?’The verb in the medial clauses which precedes the final verb funea? ‘Has he
cooked (it)?’ is not marked as a question itself, but the scope rules for the
interrogative illocutionary clitic =a force an interpretation of the entire clause
chain as interrogative.
    In clause chains in which the final verb is marked as hortative by =e ~ =o,
scope is over the whole chain as well, e.g.:

2.2.2.      Minimal and near-minimal pairs for Mian vowelsWhat was pointed out in the section on minimal and near-minimal pairs for

2.3.       Vowel lengthAlthough Mian vowels and diphthongs come in different lengths and there are
some near-minimal pairs which suggest that length might indeed be
contrastive, the question whether Mian has a phonemic length distinction in its
vowels is not a straightforward one to answer. The problematic status of
length in the vowel system is due to the fact that there are (so far) no minimal
pairs which differ in length while bearing the same tone and having the same
syllable structure and segmental context, whereas this is common in the
neighbouring language Telefol (Healey 1964b: 8-12).
    It is not entirely clear whether Smith and Weston (1974a) actually include
a series of phonemically long vowels in their analysis. In their treatment of
Mian phonemes, they do not explicitly posit a phonemic length distinction but
speak of “lengthened” vowels instead, which carry two tones and are from 1½
to 2 times longer than “single” vowels (1974a: 6). All of these words show a
rising pitch contour. “Lengthened” vowels are analysed as a sequence of two
vowels which form two adjacent syllable nuclei (p. 14). This sounds as if there
is no phonemic length contrast involved. However, they give two (near-)
minimal pairs under the heading ‘Examples of Length Contrasts’ (p. 13).
32    2. Phonology    Smith and Weston’s analysis shifts the burden of explaining the differences
in vowel length to syllabification. However, both auditory impression and the
F0 trace of words which they treat as having “lengthened”, and thus
heterosyllabic vowels clearly suggest a rising contour over one syllable, albeit
one with a long vowel, instead of two level tones, each attached to one
syllable. Furthermore, I find that syllables with contour tones are pronounced
as a single syllable. There is no additional increase in intensity on the
supposed second nucleus, which might point to an analysis of such words as
disyllabic.
    According to Smith and Weston (1974a: 14), the evidence for their analysis
of “lengthened” vowels comes from the fact that Mian vowels and diphthongs
have two varieties, one being about 1½ to 2 times longer than the other one.
This observation is – at least in a few instances – correct.5 Consider the
difference in vowel length in the following two potential near-minimal length
pairs. Vowel length value is the mean out of three tokens of each word uttered
in isolation by a single speaker.","[56, 57, 58]"

3.12.5.     With a semantically more specific verbOccasionally, an ideophone combines with a more specific verb, which

independent sentence or whole clause chain) for illocutionary force. The
inventory comprises:(195) =be        ‘Declarative’
      =bo        ‘Emphatic, quotative’
      =ble       ‘Exclamative’
      =a         ‘Question’
      =e         ‘(Content) Question’
      =o         ‘Hortative (first person singular and plural, third person
                 singular)’
          =e     ‘Hortative (second person singular, second/third person
                 plural)’All illocutionary clitics are discussed in 12.1. The interrogative clitics =e and
=a receive treatment under question formation in chapter 10. The hortative
clitics are described in 8.6.8.
    The illocutionary clitic =bo ‘Emphatic, quotative’ has three different
functions in Mian. First, it is used to mark embedded quotatives (see 13.1).
Second, while =be just signals that an utterance is declarative, =bo can be used
to make a statement more emphatic, especially under negation, as in (196):(196) nái=o                fiamî=e                fiamî=ba=bo
      vagina=SG.F          arrow_type=SG.N1       arrow_type=NEG=EMPH          toli=e                          tem=e

          ‘they pierced her vagina on a Fiami arrow – not a Fiami arrow – a
          Toli arrow, and then …’ [Initiation ritual]Third, =bo is used in clause chains to indicate that the event described in the
following clause comes as a surprise. In this function it only occurs following
a medial verb form of the intransitive verb têm’/temê’ ‘have a look’, for
example:

          ‘she went down and had a look and  oh no!  since the water had
          dried up, ...’ [Flood]
3.13.2.     Medial verb cliticsThe medial verb marker =a cliticizes to medial verbs in clause chains. It is
probably derived from the coordinating conjunction eka ‘and’. There is a
second medial verb marker =ta which I assume is a clitic sequence of an
unidentified element =t and the medial verb marker =a. The semantic
difference between =a and =ta is unclear and hence both are glossed as MED
‘medial’. Some speakers use =to instead of =ta.","[182, 183, 184]"
"Yet, despite the considerable degree of similarity between medial and final
verbs, there are principled differences between the two. Medial verbs can
neither be marked for irrealis or deontic mood nor for negative polarity. Nor
can they be inflected for hortative mood. Furthermore, medial and final verbs
do not co-occur with the same set of clitics. While the latter co-occur with
clitics indicative of illocutionary force, such as =be ‘Declarative’ and =e
‘(Content) question’, the former usually only co-occur with the medial verb
marker =a. This marker is presumably derived from the co-ordinator =a ‘and’
which is used to coordinate noun phrases, e.g. tn=a unáng=a=i
[child=and woman=and=PL.AN] ‘(the) children and women’, and which in
turn is a shortened form of eka ‘and’.
    As noted above, morphological markers indicating co- or disjoint subject
reference are a common feature of medial verbs in clause chaining
constructions. Medial verbs carry a marker (which may be zero), whose main
function is to indicate whether the subject of the verb in the following clause
has the same subject or a different one, but which also incorporates other
meanings, mainly temporal and aspectual ones, such as sequentiality (SEQ)
and simultaneity (SIM) of events described by the two consecutive clauses
(Stirling 1993, Roberts 1997). The following sections deal with S/R
morphology of medial verbs in Mian.",[450]

6.6.     Dyadic termsDyadic terms are a subclass of the word class of nouns. They refer to a social
or a kin relationship between two or more people and encode relational
opposites (Evans 2003a, 2006). They can function as heads of noun phrases
which in turn are arguments of the predicate in the same clause. An example is
given in (69):
224    6. The noun phrase(69)   dab=i                                 y

       ‘after the brothers had left it (as it was), one of them…’ [Danenok]Most frequently, dyads occur with a plural possessive pronoun which refers to
the whole set of individuals described by the dyad. The possessive pronoun
has appositive meaning:(70)   b           mikim
       2PL.POSS     opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
       ‘you, brother and sister’The reason why I analyse the dyad as the noun phrase head with a possessive
pronoun in the possessor slot and not as a noun phrase apposed to a free
pronoun (an analysis suggested by the English translation I have chosen for
example (70) is because the pronoun forms are clearly from the possessive
pronoun series:(71)   *bo     mikimIn (71) the free personal pronoun cannot be used, cf. also nb mikim ‘we
(INCL), brother and sister’ and unacceptable *nbo mikim. I assume that the
possessive analysis is extended to the cases where the possessive pronoun is
homophonous with the free pronoun:(72)                   mikim
       3PL.AN.POSS      opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
       ‘they, brother and sister’ [MPI Reciprocals clip 1]Dyads can be preceded by a proper name or kin noun, which is in an
appositional relation with the dyad, forming an inclusory construction.
Reference is to the dyad of individuals, only one of which is explicitly named.
Examples are given below:(73)   Danenok   dab-wal

6.7.        Noun phrase coordinationMian has four strategies for the coordination of noun phrases:-      juxtaposition
-      coordination with =sa ‘too’
-      coordination by =a ‘and’
-      coordination by eka ‘and’All of these strategies are available for animate and inanimate nouns alike.
Coordination by juxtaposition shows a maximum of two coordinated noun
phrases in the corpus whereas there is no upper limit of coordinated noun
phrase for the other two strategies.
    The simplest strategy of noun phrase coordination is juxtaposition.
Coordination by juxtaposition is mainly used if the referents of the coordinate
noun phrases are relatively low in individuation. Examples (77) and (78)
illustrate this for animates and inanimates, respectively:(77)      naka homòn     unáng     homòn=i
          man many       woman     many=AN.PL
          ‘many men and many women’ [Sofelok, 2]
226    6. The noun phrase(78)   db=o          ket=o
       seed=N1.PL blossom=N1.PL
       ‘seeds and blossoms’ [Sofelok, 1]Coordination by juxtaposition is not available with noun phrases referring to
individuals or singular entities in subject or object position. However,
juxtaposition of proper names occurs in the possessor position:(79)   Fitibkanib=o Dimoson                        wengsâng=o
       PN=SG.F           PN          3PL.AN.POSS story=N2
       ‘the story of Fitibkanib and Dimosson’ [Fitibkanib and Dimosson]Givón (1990: 497) notes that noun phrases which are conjoined by simple
juxtaposition often yield unified group lexical items. Wälchli (2005) calls
compounds whose component parts refer to stereotypically conjoined entities
additive co-compounds. Mian has a few such lexical items, e.g. alél-melel (lit.
wife-offspring) ‘(core) family’ and awók-aalok ‘adults, parents’, consisting of
awók ‘mother’ and a cranberry morph -aalok without any synchronically
establishable meaning. Although these were probably formed by juxtaposition
and at least partially have become semantically opaque, noun phrase
juxtaposition synchronically is a syntactic device forming coordinate noun
phrases without any tendency for lexicalization.
   The second coordination strategy involves the clitic noun phrase modifier
=sa ‘too’, which attaches to each coordinate noun phrase. Coordinate noun
phrases can refer to individuals (80) or to groups (81). The coordinated noun
phrases are bracketed:(80)   [Kasening     ]=sa         [Albet    ]=sa          y
       PN            3SG.M=too     PN        3SG.M=too      there       tl-Ø-io=be

                                            6.7. Noun phrase coordination   227The third coordination strategy uses the clitic =a ‘and’ (presumably a
shortened form of eka ‘and’), which cliticizes to each noun phrase in the
coordinate structure, as in (82) and (83) or just appears once on the rightmost
member of the coordination, as in (84). Note that the order of the article and
the coordinator on the last coordinated member is reversed. Reversal does not
take place if the last noun in the coordination ends in /a/, as in (83):(82)   naka=ya unáng=a=i
       man=and woman=and=PL.AN
       ‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson](83)   tn=a        unáng=a      naka=i=a

       brother-PL=PL.AN     husband-PL=and=PL.AN
       ‘brothers and husbands’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]An example of an inanimate noun phrase coordinated with =a ‘and’ is
provided in (85):(85)   n=a         kakab=a       bobol=a=o
       liver=and lungs=and heart=and=PL.N1
       ‘liver, lungs, and heart’ [Crows]Instead of =a ‘and’ one also finds eka ‘and’ in noun phrase coordination. The
coordinated noun phrases appear in square brackets:(86)   [Memin    i=e]       eka [Daning       i=e]       eka
       PN        father=SG.M and PN            father=SG.M and
       ‘Memin’s father and Daning’s father’ (from Smith and Weston

       SG.M=too
       ‘he himself and Bokolfet’s younger brother too’ [Mianmin and
       Telefomin]
228    6. The noun phraseThe conjunction eka ‘and’ is also used for the coordination of adjectival
modifiers within a single noun phrase. The first adjective in such a
coordination must not have a distributed article, as in example (88):(88)   sob=e           sm(*=e)          eka   tekebmín   le
       soap=SG.N1 big(*=SG.N1)           and   long       DEM.PROX.SG.N1
       ‘this big and long (bar of) soap’
6.8.     Noun phrase appositionIn my analysis of noun phrase apposition in Mian I follow Rijkhoff (2002),
who defines appositional modifiers as “all those elements which semantically
speaking serve the same purpose as their non-apposed […] counterparts, but
which from a syntactic point of view are not part of the […] phrase containing
the head noun. An obvious requirement of any apposed modifier phrase is co-
reference: it must refer to the same entity as the other member(s) in the
appositional construction” (p. 22).
   Appositive noun phrases always follow the noun phrase to which they are
apposed. Typical examples include apposition of a proper name, as in (89) and
(90), specification of a profession (91), and a reflexive pronoun with
contrastive function (92). In the following examples, the appositional
modifiers are separated by a comma.(89)   n           imak=e,             Nialiaaleb=e

6.9.     Noun phrase topicalizationTopic-marking in Mian is done with the topic clitic =le which attaches to
noun phrases, including free pronouns. I analyse =le as a clitic rather than an
affix because it not only attaches to pronouns but can mark topical adverbial
clauses and medial clauses in clause chains as well. Topical constituents with
=le are intonationally detached from the following clause.
    Topic marking with =le is incompatible with emphatic pronouns, which
are used for focus (see 6.10), e.g. *-ta=le [3SG.M-EMPH=TOP].
    Topic-only question are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is
mentioned. The speaker has a particular question in mind, and it must be
obvious from the context what the implied question is, such as I’m going. And
you? (Implied: Are you going as well?). Two examples are given below:(94)   kbo=le?
       2SG.M=TOP
       ‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
       ‘What do you want to eat?’)(95)   Mandat    =le?
       PN        3SG.M=TOP
       ‘What about Milsen?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Milsen doing?’
       ‘Where is Milsen?’)Topic marking is commonly found in personal introductions (|| marks an
intonational break in all examples in this section):(96)   n=le         ||  Dabein       n-ta=bo
       1SG=TOP           PN           1SG-EMPH=QUOT
       ‘ “As for me, Dabein that’s me.” ’ [Dimosson]Subjects can be topicalized with =le, as in the following excerpts from an
account of traditional initiation, where the topic is given:
230    6. The noun phrase(97)   [...] ‘Adults would line the side of the path. Others (also adults)
       would lead the boys who are to be initiated, and they (i.e. the boys)
       walked along the path ...’       tam                 =le             ||

       ‘as for the ones on the side (i.e. the adults), they take drums and ...’
       [Initiation rituals]This bit of discourse contains two groups of adults, as opposed to the boys,
one group lining the path, the other leading the boys. The topic pronoun is
here used to establish the first group of adults as the topic of the new clause.
    Topics are typically given information but this is not necessarily the case,
as in the following example where an object is topicalized which has not been
previously mentioned in the discourse:(98)   memé          =le               ||        Sobining=e

       ‘As for the children, Sobining took them and ...’ [Sobining]Multiple topicalized constituents can often be found as discourse openers (de
Vries 2005). In the following example, the first topic yomin=o=le is a more
general topic of the whole narrative, set up here as a discourse frame by the
speaker:(99)   yomin=o=le              ||   yangpela=i=le                    ||
       initiation=N2=TOP            young_ones(TP)=PL.AN=TOP       alukûm          dli     tat-n-ib=a

       ‘As for the initiation, the young ones, they went downriver and
       then ...’ [Initation rituals]
                                               6.10. Focused noun phrases   2316.10.    Focused noun phrases“[F]ocus is the most important or salient piece of information in the utterance,
as perceived by the speaker. [...] The focus [...] always presents new
information, though new relative to the topic, not necessarily new in the
discourse” (Siewierska 2004: 159).
   Focus in Mian is marked by using an emphatic pronoun, etc., i.e. a bound
pronominal form suffixed with the emphatic pronoun suffix -ta (see 3.7.4)
Marking of focus is characteristic of Papuan languages in general, contrary to
fixed positional encoding in European languages, where focus is associated
with clause-final position (Foley 2000: 387-8).
   Contrastive focus in Mian is generally expressed by using emphatic
pronouns. Two examples are given below:(100)           Asuneb=e=mo        a-têm’-Ø-e=ba=be
      3SG.M      PN=SG.M=NEG        3SG.M.O-see-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL                Beitab     -ta

        ‘the husband went to sit down at pig fruits (to ambush pigs), the wife

questions (see 10.1.3). When there is a choice between two alternatives, each
232    6. The noun phraseexpressed by a noun phrase, both are in contrastive focus and emphatic
pronouns have to be used, as in the following example:(102) kbo           éil    -ta             bleka        aning      -ta
      2SG.M          pig    SG.M-EMPH        or           fish       SG.M-EMPH       dowôn’-aamab-eb=a?
       eat-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
       ‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’On completive focus in content questions with wan ‘who’, see 10.2.7.
  Focus marking is used in comparisons. I recorded example (103) as the
Mian translation of the English sentence “Port Moresby is bigger that
Vanimo” (|| indicates an intonational break):(103) Mosbi      =le             || sm    eka      Banimo       -ta
       PN        SG.N2=TOP           big    and      PN           SG.N2-EMPH       gwáab=o=be
       small=PRD=DECL
       ‘(As for) Port Moresby (, it) is big, and Vanimo is small.’This example consists of a topical noun phrase ‘Port Moresby’, set off
intonationally from the rest of the utterance, and a comment which actually
predicates something about this topic. The comparative element is focused
with -ta, but the statement, which prima facie seems to be about Vanimo, is in
effect a statement about the topic Port Moresby.
Chapter 7
The postpositional phrase
7.0.     IntroductionPostpositional phrases are adverbial adjuncts which fulfil a variety of
functions, such as situating an event spatially or temporally, or specifying an
instrument involved in an action. Postpositional phrases in Mian are always
syntactically optional. They provide additional adverbial information but their
omission never renders a clause syntactically incomplete.
   Postpositions can be simple or complex. An example of a simple
postposition is (1). Simple postpositions typically encliticize if their
complement is bare, as in (2):(1)    naka    -ta             baka
       man     PL.AN-EMPH       with       hâa’-bi-Ø-ob=a

       ‘while she was curing (them, i.e. frogs) with a torch there,
       someone else ...’ [Crows]Complex postpositions either consist of two or three combined postpositions,
e.g. tabáab-tem-daak [beneath-in(to)-down] ‘down underneath’, as in (3), or
they are denominal derivations formed by suffixing -daa ‘at’ to a noun (see
3.1.5), as in (4):(3)    hàs=e              tabáab-tem-daak
       hat(TP)=SG.N1      beneath-in(to)-down
       ‘down underneath the hat’(4)    as=e              dáang-daa
       tree=SG.N1        back-at
       ‘at the back of the tree (i.e. the side hitting the ground first when
       the tree is felled)’
234    7. The postpositional phrase7.1.     Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a directionalThese consist of one noun phrase without a determiner and one directional
postposition. The inventory of directionals comprises:(5)    ut          ‘up(wards)’
       daak        ‘down(wards)’
       met         ‘up(river)’
       tab         ‘down(river)’
       tm         ‘sideways, at the same level’
       wt         ‘across’For every postpositional phrase, there is an allative and a locative
interpretation:(6)    kim=daak              to-fâ-n-e=a
       ground=down           3SG.LONG.O-put.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED

       ‘he grabbed (across) his wife’s hand’ [Flood]There are some structures which show that directionals when used as
postpositions do not follow nouns but noun phrases. In (9), the complement is
a noun phrase consisting of a possessor and a noun head. In (10), the
complement is a nominalisation unin ‘activitiy of ingesting’ with its object aa
‘water’:(9)    hen            tab                tem-Ø-e=a
       seek.IPFV      downriver          look.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
                 7.1. Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a directional   235       [kwin=i           bibam] NP tab=o
       ghost=PL.AN       village      downriver=N2
       ‘he was seeking (for his wife), he looked downriver, downriver at the
       ghost village’ [Ghost village](10)   [aa          un-in]               daak=o

       ‘down at the water drinking (place), a large tree broke down and then
       they …’ [Flood]The noun phrase serving as a complement of a directional never has an article
or any other adnominal determiner nor can it be followed by adjectival
modifiers:(11)   *Skiobib=o=tab
       PN=N2=downriver
       Intended: ‘downriver at/to Skiobib’The postpositional phrase can optionally be followed by an article. In this case
the postposition does not cliticize. The article can agree in gender and number
with the noun in the preceding complement. The following two examples
show that the article following the postposition agrees in gender and number
with kakam ‘buttocks, butt’ (gender: N1) and tibín ‘river head’ (gender: N2),
respectively:(12)   kakam            tab=e             […]     ge-n-e=a
       buttocks(N1) down=SG.N1            [...]   tie.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he tied (it) down at the buttocks’ [Selimin](13)   ut-n-ib=a                         Sek     tibín                   ut=o
       up-SS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED        PN      river_head(N2)          up=N2
       ‘they ascended, up to the head of the river Sek’ [Flood]Gender agreement of the article is mostly disregarded and =o is used
regardless of the gender of the noun, thus instead of kakam tab=e ‘down at the
buttocks’ in (12) one also finds kakam tab=o. The article =o also marks
temporal nouns (see 3.1.9) and adverbial clauses (see 13.2) and is a default
marker for all adverbial adjuncts.
236    7. The postpositional phrase    The phrases kakam tabe and Sek tibín uto in (12) and (13) might look like
noun phrases as far as their internal syntax is concerned because they end in
an article. But in simple postpositional phrases with a directional only the
article is allowed. Noun phrases allow the full range of adnominally used
pronouns (see 6.2.3).","[249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262]"

      ‘this man’The proximal demonstrative agrees in number and gender with the noun it
follows. It is employed when the object in question is close to the speaker. The
form le is also used as a spatial adverb meaning ‘here’ and the form lo is
also used as a temporal adverb meaning ‘now’. The distal series is used when
the object is remote from the speaker. The form y (and y) is also used as a
spatial adverb meaning ‘there’.
    Apart from the adnominal use illustrated in (130) and (131), the proximal
demonstrative can also be used pronominally using the same forms. In its
pronominal use the demonstrative constitutes a noun phrase of its own, as in

      ‘as for the boy’The form in (133) is pronounced [ l ] because of high-tone spreading. The
form in (134), however, is pronounced [ l] because the topic clitic bears a
low tone, which prevents tone spreading from the left. In all other cases this
issue does not arise because the two forms in question are not segmentally
identical (in addition to the tonal difference illustrated for (133) and (134)
above):(135) unáng     lo

      ‘as for the woman’The distal demonstrative series formally distinguishes between an adnominal
and a pronominal series. The former always involves the clitic element =obba,
followed by the distal demonstrative.
    As in the proximal series, distal demonstratives always follow the noun and
reflect number and gender:(137) ninín=obba            y

      ‘ “No, that wasn’t a stick.” ’ [Pig story]The position of demonstratives within the noun phrase is discussed further in
section 6.3.7.
   There is an emphatic series of the distal demonstrative. These forms have a
restrictive meaning and can be used pronominally (140) or adnominally (141):(140) y-ta

pronominally and they can instantiate a noun phrase by themselves. Only the
forms of the third person plural are given in the synopsis, but cross-references
are provided in case the reader wants to look up the full pronominal
paradigms.
    In the third person, all emphatic pronouns, the proximal demonstratives
and the emphatic distal demonstrative pronoun can also be used adnominally
in the rightmost position in the noun phrase.
    The forms li and lita of the proximal demonstrative are only used
adnominally, the forms li and lita have both adnominal and pronominal
uses. All distal demonstratives co-occur with the clitic =obba, which follows
the noun, in their adnominal form.","[162, 163, 164]"

simply -a followed by -n ‘Realis’. Especially because the /n/ in the suffix -an
is sometimes left out, possibly on analogy with the alternation -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’
in directly inflected verb forms (see 8.6.1.7). Thus, gwánaebe ‘he became a

verbalizer is indeed -an and not just -a: *háangasea.

combine with a coverb in a complex predication. The coverbs of the former
are ideophones (e.g. fong ‘whistle’), while the latter typically occurs with a
noun (e.g. tekein ‘knowledge’), but serves a wider range of functions (see
below). Ge/ga~gena ‘say’ is also used in quotatives and embedded questions
(see 13.1). Complex predicates involving function verbs will be discussed in
detail in section 8.9.
   Two examples follow:(58)      fong       ge-s-e=a

          ‘Many man and women knew (of it), and ...’ [Sofelok, 2]The function verb ke ‘do’ has a range of other functions, which I only mention
in passing here. A more detailed description can be found in 8.9.2. The
function verb ke ‘do’:-      can follow an adverb, e.g. heb ke [fast do] ‘hurry’.
-      productively takes Tok Pisin noun and verb loans as coverbs to form
       new (complex) verbs, e.g. kot ke [court do] ‘stand trial’, sakim ke [suck
       do] ‘suck’.
-      can follow any of the basic numerals asú ‘two’, asusûna ‘two’, and
       asumâtna ‘three’ to express that a group consists of a certain number
       of individuals, e.g. asumâtna ke [three do] ‘be three of’.","[134, 135]"

Notes to Chapter 11 1.   The evidence for first person plural subjects remains inconclusive. As first
      person plural forms are only sparsely attested in the spontaneous data corpus, I
      tested the behaviour of verbs inflected with -n with first person plural subjects
      in elicitation. A co-referent subject in the reference clause was always accepted
      but speaker judgments were inconsistent when reference was disjoint. What’s
      more, examples which had been accepted earlier were rejected later.

 4.   In my analysis of the Mian gender system, I treat genders as singular-plural
      pairs defined by sets of affixes. Both masculine and neuter 1 gender have -e as
      the subject marker. If the subject of the marked clause is masculine and the
      subject of the reference clause is neuter1 both verbs will have -e in the subject
      slot (see chapter 4).

      might be used to describe slow motion footage of the event of a bullet hitting
      somebody at exactly one o’clock but under normal circumstances they sound
      odd.

      fillers which is unattested in final verbs in a clause chaining construction. -Nab
      only occurs in medial verbs where it indicates DS and event sequentiality with
      a short interval between marked and reference clause events. It also occurs in
      simple independent sentences with the meaning ‘Near past’.
 2.   This is possibly due to (accidental) homophony between =a ‘medial’ and =a

"
8.6.5.    Inflection of the existential verbThe existential verb n/bi~bl occurs on its own as a main verb with the
meaning ‘be (there), stay, exist, remain’. The perfective stem n is always a
bound form, whereas there are a bound stem bl and a free stem bi in the
imperfective. The latter form, bi, can be inflected but can also appear in its
bare form in serial verb constructions. The imperfective stem is realized as bl
when followed by /i/.
   The existential verb plays an important role in the paradigms of verbs that
need to be serialized with one of the stems of the existential verb to express
certain TAM categories (see 8.6.7).
   The existential verb has a number of irregular stems apart from the basic
perfective-imperfective distinction n/bi~bl, which will be discussed below.
300     8. Verb morphologyTable 8.14 sets out stem contrasts and inflectional possibilities for the
existential verb.
   There are several noteworthy features about TAM inflection in the
existential verb.
   First, -n ‘Realis’ contrasts with -Ø ‘Imperfective’, while in all other
directly inflected verbs -n and -Ø are allomorphs with the meaning ‘Realis’.
Thus, there are both (156) and (157):Table 8.14. Stem contrasts and inflection of the existential verb n/bi~bl
 Stem                                          TAM

 bi (Imperfective stem)                        -s ‘Remote past’
                                               -aamab/ -omab ‘Irrealis’

                                               -b ‘Imperfective’

      ‘He has grabbed it.’(157) a-fû’-Ø-e=be
      3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has grabbed it.’This allomorphy is not found in the existential verb. Elision of -n in forms of
the existential verb creates a semantic contrast. Compare (158) and (159):(158) bi-n-e=be
      stay.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has been staying (up to now).’(159) bi-Ø-e=be
      stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He is staying.’The second noteworthy feature about the existential verb is that it has three
additional stems apart from the perfective stem n- and the imperfective stems
                                        8.6. TAM morphology of final verbs    301bi~bl-: biaaH ‘stay (Non-hodiernal past)’, example (160), bina               ‘stay

      ‘I was staying (but not today).’(161) bina-b-o=be
      stay.HAB-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
      ‘She stays habitually.’Third, irrealis mood in the imperfective is formed with -aamab, if the subject
is not animate plural. If it is, -omab is used:(162) bi-aamab-i=be
      stay.IPFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I will be staying.’(163) bi-omab-io=be
      stay.IPFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘You (PL)/they will be staying.’The existential verb shows two contracted forms. When either of the forms
bi-Ø-e [stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ] ‘he stays’ or bi-Ø-o [stay.IPFV-IPFV-
3SG.F.SBJ] ‘she stays’ are followed by =a ‘Question’ the disallowed vowel
clusters *[mbia] and *[mbioa] are simplified to [mbia] and [mbua], respectively.
    Apart from these differences, TAM inflection of the existential verb
proceeds in much the same way as in other directly inflected verbs. The
perfective stem n is used in irrealis forms in the perfective (164) and (165) and
in deontic forms (166):(164) n-amab-i=be
      stay.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I will stay.’(165) n-omab-io=be
      stay.PFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘You/they will stay.’(166) n-im-i=be
      stay.PFV-DEONT-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I should stay.’
302      8. Verb morphologyForms which are only marked -n ‘Realis’ are by default interpreted as
referring to events having taken place immediately before the moment of
speaking and appear interspersed in texts about the far and remote past.(167) bi-n-o=be
      stay.IPFV-REAL-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
      ‘She has been staying (up to now)/was staying.’For realis forms, further temporal specification is possible by suffixing -so
‘Hesternal past’ or -bio ‘General past’:(168) bi-n-i-so=be
      stay.IPFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-HPST=DECL
      ‘I was staying yesterday.’(169) bi-n-i-bio=be
      stay.IPFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
      ‘I was staying.’
8.6.6.     Negation (with the existential verb)Negation is commonly expressed with the negative particle mo and the clitic
=ba, which is always the last formative in the verb before the illocutionary
particle (see 3.13.3). Mian has an alternative way of expressing negative
polarity in the perfective only, involving an invariable form of the existential
verb:(170) Tesinab=e       tl-im             bl-im=o=be
      PN=SG.M         come.PFV-NEG      exist-NEG=PRD=DECL
      ‘Tesinab hasn’t come.’ [Observed]In this example the perfective verb stem tl is inflected with -im signalling
negative polarity, followed by the existential verb bl inflected with the same
suffix, effectively yielding a double negation construction.
   The exact semantic difference between this type of negation and the
negation with =ba and their respective usages are not fully clear at the
moment. However, a few observations can be made which might inform
further research. The negation with the existential verb is restricted to
perfective aspect and can only be used to express negative polarity of events
which could have happened (but did not happen) in the past. For instance, it is
                                         8.6. TAM morphology of final verbs    303not allowed with future time reference. In order to say that someone will not
or does not want to come, only the ba-negation is possible:(171) Tesinab=e=mo      tl-aamab-e=ba=be
      PN=SG.M=NEG       come.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL
      ‘Tesinab won’t/doesn’t want to come.’Likewise negation with the existential verb is disallowed in the imperfective.
Again, the ba-negation needs to be used:(172) Tesinab=e=mo          wen-b-e=ba=be
      PN=SG.M=NEG           eat.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL
      ‘Tesinab isn’t eating.’
8.6.7.    Auxiliary-serialized verbsFor some TAM combinations, e.g. realis or remote past marking in the
imperfective, verbs have to be serialized with a range of auxiliary stems,
which all belong to the existential verb. Also, verbs of some conjugation
classes (see 8.4) require an auxiliary to be inflected for certain TAM
categories, e.g. irrealis in V-stems, as opposed to N-stems which are directly
inflected. The stems of the existential verb are used as auxiliaries in the sense
that they are necessary in the verb form to bear the inflection. All stems used
as auxiliaries also appear in independent forms of the existential verb.
    The justification of this analysis as a serialization has to be postponed after
the criteria for verb serializations have been discussed (see 11.1.4).
    Table 8.15 below summarizes all possibilities for the serialization of
perfective and imperfective stems with an auxiliary stem.
    While directly inflected verbs have -n and -Ø as allomorphs with the
meaning ‘Realis’, in the inflection of the existential verb -n ‘Realis’ contrasts
with -Ø ‘Imperfective’ (see 8.6.5 above). We observe the same contrast in
auxiliary-serialized verb forms. Compare (173) and (174):(173) a-fû’-bi-n-e=be
      3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL

8.6.7.1. Auxiliary-serialization with imperfective stemsImperfective stems need an auxiliary in order to be inflected for -n ~ -Ø
‘Realis’, -s ‘Remote past’, or -b(H) ‘Non-hodiernal past’, and for the (present)
habitual and the past habitual.
    Imperfective V-stems (i.e. verbs stems ending in an vowel) cannot be
inflected directly for realis mood. Instead, they have to be serialized with the
imperfective stem bi of the existential verb. Realis forms have immediate past
as their default temporal interpretation, but they occur interspersed in texts
about the far and remote past:(175) wen-bi-n-e=be
      eat.IPFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has been eating (until now).’ OR ‘He was eating (at any time in
      the past)’Forms with the auxiliary bi inflected with -n ‘Realis’ can be further suffixed
with -so ‘Hesternal past’ and -bio ‘General past’ to locate events at different
levels of temporal remoteness:(176) wen-bi-n-e-so=be
      eat.IPFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ-HPST=DECL
      ‘He was eating yesterday.’(177) wen-bi-n-e-bio=be

auxiliary only co-occurs with -b(H) ‘Non-hodiernal past’ in the TAM slot, as in
(179). Non-hodiernal past forms of the existential verb always bear a high
tone on the subject suffix.(179)           sesá=tem

"In the rest of this section on generic terms I discuss a few peculiarities of the
classificatory construction.
    First, generic term and referential noun obligatorily or preferably occur in
reverse order in a few cases:(64)    taan wan         ‘Metallic starling’ (sc. Alponis metallica)
        takumein hok     ‘scorpion species’In order to refer to a metallic starling, one says taan wan. To just say *taan is
out of the question. The generic term cannot be left out, which suggests that
examples like taan wan form a very close compound-like structure.
                                                          6.6. Dyadic terms    223   Second, some names for individual species simply lack a generic term, and
exist outside the folk taxonomy. Examples are:(65)   iwát ‘breadfruit’       ‘breadfruit (tree)’        *as iwát
                               (sc. Artocarpus altilis)
       mifím ‘sago’            ‘sago (palm)’              *as mifím
                               (sc. Metroxylon sagu)Third, the referential term can be an adjective, for example:(66)   wan     namâ        ‘Sulphur-crested cockatoo’ (sc. Cacatua galerita)
       bird    whiteThe noun phrase in (66) behaves exactly like two nominal elements in a
classification construction, rather than like a noun and adjectival modifier. To
appreciate this point, we have to consider an example in which (66) occurs in
an utterance, where the appearance of the article allows us to draw
conclusions about the structure involved:(67)   wan     namâ=e           y       ei-b-e=be
       bird    white=SG.M       there    fly.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘A/the cockatoo is flying there.’
       OR ‘A/the white bird is flying there.’(68)   wan=e       namâ=e           y       ei-b-e=be
       bird=SG.M   white=SG.M       there    fly.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ONLY ‘A/the white bird is flying there.’In (67), the noun phrase as a whole bears the article, which results in the
ambiguity. However, if the article is distributed throughout the noun phrase, as
in (68), the structure can only be one of a head noun followed by an adjectival
modifier.","[248, 249]"
"
8.6.7.2. Habitual formsVerbs inflected with -b ‘Imperfective’ can have a (present) habitual
interpretation apart from the more basic continuous meaning (see 8.6.1.4).
However, there is also a dedicated habitual construction involving the
auxiliary habitual stem of the existential verb bina. As one would expect, the
habitual auxiliary cannot be collocated with perfective stems. Habitual verb
forms are always further suffixed by -b ‘Imperfective’.(180) ae,       n      amítye
      yes,      1SG     always

       ‘Yes, I see him all the time.’ [TMA Questionnaire, 40]Habitual verb form with bina are often collocated with the adverbs sún(ye)
‘habitually’ and amít(ye) ‘always’.
   The past habitual is formed by serializing biaana with an imperfective
stem. Again, there is obligatory further suffixation of the imperfective aspect
suffix -b:(181) naka=i

       ‘They used to use poison magic on people (but not anymore).’
       [Dafinau]
8.6.7.3. Auxiliary-serialization with perfective stemsSome perfective stems can be serialized with an imperfective auxiliary in
order to express that the result of the action denoted by the perfective stem is
continuing after the execution of the action. Consider the perfective-only verb
stem -fû’/— ‘grab’. In (182), the result of a punctual action is described. In
(183), the focus is on the continuation of the result of the action of grabbing,
i.e. holding:(182) a-fû’-n-e=be
      3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has grabbed it.’(183) a-fû-bi-n-e=be
      3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has been holding it.’ (lit. ‘He has grabbed it and has been
      staying up to now’)The core class of perfective stems which can be serialized with a stem of the
existential verb in the function of an auxiliary are those which show this
aspect alternation. Perfective stems which belong to the core class almost all
lack an imperfective stem:

       -waa/—             ‘hide’From this core group of perfective stems, the possibility of auxiliary-
serialization extends to other perfective stems, for which the aspect alternation
is less obvious because they refer to activities, which are extended in time,
rather than to punctual events. Some of these have distinct imperfective stems,
for example:
308    8. Verb morphology(185) dowôn’              ‘eat (PFV)’, has an IPFV stem wen ‘eat (IPFV)’
      fa                  ‘make a fire (PFV)’, has an IPFV stem faka ‘make
                          a fire (IPFV)
        kimâa’/—          ‘look out for, guard, protect’
        mama/—            ‘walk around’
        meleklaa/—        ‘work hard’
        melek/—           ‘work hard’
        -silêb/—          ‘follow (directly)’An example is provided in (186):(186) n      dowôn’-bi-n-i-so=be
      1SG     eat.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-HPST=DECL
      ‘Yesterday, having eaten I was staying.’As there is an obvious aspect mismatch in forms like dowôn’binisobe in (186),
which consists of a perfective stem dowôn’ ‘eat’ and an imperfective auxiliary
bi, the two events cannot be interpreted as overlapping but rather as a bounded
event plus the continuation of the result of this event, thus dowôn’binisobe
‘yesterday, having eaten I stayed’.
    In order to express that the result of a bounded event is continuing at the
present moment, a perfective stem must be serialized with the imperfective
auxiliary stem bi which is then suffixed by -Ø ‘Imperfective’, as in (187):(187) két=e
      container=SG.N1        a-fû’-bi-Ø-e=be
        3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He’s holding the container’ (lit. ‘Having grabbed the container,
        he’s staying’)Imperfective stems generally do not have this possibility, but see 8.4 for
obligatorily auxiliary-serialized verbs in the imperfective (X-stems), where an
imperfective stem is followed by a form of the existential verb.","[331, 332, 333, 334]"

2.1.1.4. The lateral glide /l/The lateral glide /l/ is the most complex phoneme in terms of its allophonic
variation. In native words, it is realized by all speakers as the voiced, pre-
nasalized, alveolar stop [d] word-initially. Phonetic [l] occurs word-initially
only in a few Tok Pisin loans, e.g. lotu [lotu] ‘church’, lais [lais] ‘rice’, and
ledio [ldio] ‘radio’.
    As far as the question whether this phoneme should be analysed as /l/ or /d/
is concerned, I opt for /l/ because, given that /b/ is devoiced syllable-finally,
we would expect that devoicing also applies to a syllable-final /d/-phoneme,
but syllable-final /l/ is always realized as either [l] or [], never as [t].
    /l/ is only pronounced [d] word-internally if the preceding syllable ends in
a consonant. Compare:(1)              áandal          /LHa n-lal/   [a ndl]     ‘river bank’
                 dingdang        /Llila/     [dida]    ‘thin’
        BUT      elàak           /HL-la k/    [ là kh]   ‘down here’That /l/ is not pronounced [d] or [d] word-medially between vowels, even
though in syllable-initial position, can be seen from the example /LHtil=o=Lb/
[thi.l. ], *[thi.d. ] ‘it’s a dog’.
    Apart from these fixed rules, pronunciation of /l/ varies considerably
between speakers. Generally, /l/ can be realized as [l] in all other positions
apart from word-initial and word-medial position following a consonant.
Some speakers pronounce /l/ as [l] only syllable-finally, but as an alveolar trill
[r] between /t/ and a vowel in the syllable-initial cluster /tl/, and as an alveolar
flap [ ] in all other contexts, e.g. as second member of the syllable-initial
consonant clusters /bl, kl, l, sl, fl/ and between vowels.
    Some speakers do not have [l] at all. They pronounce /l/ as [ ] in all
positions with a certain tendency to have [r] in the syllable-initial cluster /tl/.
                                                                         2.1. Consonants   23These speakers sometimes spell /tl/ as <tr> when writing their language.
Examples of the different pronunciations of the lateral glide /l/:(2)     dót             /LHlot/            [dt ]                             ‘very’
        dabáal          /LHlabal/         [dál]      [dá]             ‘ground’
        klaa            /Lkla/            [kla]         [ka]                ‘rot’
        tle             /Ltl/             [tl]          [t]        [tr]    ‘come’There is one additional context – not covered by the rules given above – in
which /l/ is pronounced [d], namely reduplication:3(3)   diadia        /Llialia/      [djadja]           ‘quickly’/l/ is the only phoneme in Mian which can form word-initial geminate clusters,
namely /ll/:(4)   dli      /Llli/    [dli]      [di]       ‘dance (v.)’The phoneme /l/ also occurs as the second member of the syllable-initial
consonant clusters /bl, tl, kl, gl, fl, sl/. None of the allophones of /l/ is
pronounced as voiceless when preceded by a voiceless stop, e.g. /Lkla/ [kla],
but *[kl a] ‘rot’.","[48, 49]"

examples are given below:(34)   Febluali=e       dim     -ta
       PN= SG.N1        on      SG.N1-EMPH
       ‘in February’(35)   am     mak        dim=o
       day    another on=N2
       ‘on another day, sometimes, sometime’Temporal postpositional phrases typically appear immediately before the verb
(see 9.10.5).

Verb morphology
8.0.      IntroductionThe Mian verb is by far the most morphologically complex category in the
language. Many verbs formally distinguish a perfective and an imperfective
stem, which are used to express bounded and unbounded events, respectively.
Aspectual stem distinctions are a typical feature of the Mountain Ok
languages (Healey 1964a: 68). They can also be found in other Papuan
languages, e.g. Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and Abui (Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86).
    Mian is mildly polysynthetic in that all finite verbs obligatorily index their
subject and the recipient object, if a recipient is part of the verb’s argument
structure. A subset of verbs also marks their objects. All argument affixes are
pronominal in nature, i.e. they are not pure agreement affixes. They cross-
reference overt argument noun phrases, which can be freely elided. Argument
affixes agree with overt argument noun phrases in person, number and gender.
If the argument noun phrase is elided, argument affixes agree anaphorically.
    The verb has two slots for tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, one on either
side of the subject suffix slot. The pre-subject slot accommodates a range of
tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, whereas the post-subject slot is filled only by
tense suffixes. The fillers of the post-subject slot are probably more recent
grammaticalizations from erstwhile auxiliary constructions, in which an
inflected auxiliary has been reanalysed as a tense suffix.
    Verbs are inflected directly for certain TAM combinations. Direct
inflection here means that the TAM suffix is appended directly to the verb
stem. A serialization of a lexical verb stem with a form of the existential verb
is required for other TAM combinations. In this case the TAM suffix is
appended to the existential verb.
    It is typical for verbs in many Papuan languages to be marked for
illocutionary force (Foley 1986: 164). Mian has several sentential clitic
particles which attach to the verb to signal the illocutionary force of an
utterance as declarative or quotative, as a question, or as hortative.
    Mian verbs productively form serial verb constructions. Verb serialization
is discussed in section 11.1 under chaining.
244    8. Verb morphology8.1.     Classification of verbsVerbs can be classified according to three criteria, namely position in the
sentence, possibility of direct inflection, and finiteness. A further division in
four conjugation classes will be made in 8.4.
    First, finite verbs can either be directly inflected for various TAM
categories or serialized with an auxiliary. See 8.6.1 on directly inflected verbs
and 8.6.7 on auxiliary-serialized verbs.
    Second, finite verbs are either final or medial. Mian is a clause-chaining
language. Simple sentences contain one final verb, whereas complex
sentences usually consist of clauses chained together, each of which contains a
medial verb while the last clause in a given chain, which forms the end of the
sentence, terminates with a final verb. All final verbs index their subjects and
any of the object(s) that this verb has to index, and can be inflected for all
TAM categories, while medial verbs are slightly more restricted in terms of
their TAM morphology. Medial verbs cannot be inflected for irrealis or
deontic mood. Furthermore, they are never marked for polarity or
illocutionary force. Tense marking with -bio ‘General past’ and -so ‘Hesternal
past’ on medial verbs is possible. Medial verbs partake in the switch-reference
system of the language. They are inflected for same or different subject, i.e.
they have suffixes which mark whether or not the subject of the following
clause is the same. The same suffixes also indicate sequentiality or
simultaneity of events.
    Third, verbs are either finite or non-finite. Any verb (or serial verb
construction) marked for subject is finite, any verb not marked for subject is
non-finite.
    As medial verbs and their morphology are intricately linked to the
phenomenon of clause-chaining, their morphology is described in section 10.2
under clause-chaining constructions.","[267, 268, 269, 270]"

extent – by making reference to the interaction of vowel length with other
suprasegmental phenomena, such as tone/pitch and syllable structure, and
morphological processes, such as compounding and cliticization, which lead
to polysyllabic shortening. This is what I have done in my thesis (Fedden
2007a). In the following, I sketch this account and its issues.
    Smith and Weston’s “lengthened” vowels become much shorter when
additional material cliticizes to a (nominal) word, such as the articles =e, =o,
and =i or the predicator =o (followed by the declarative clitic =be), or when a
noun stem is compounded with another noun stem. In all of these cases the
phonological word becomes at least disyllabic which leads to polysyllabic
shortening (Lehiste 1972, Klatt 1976).
    Table 2.3 gives some data for vowel length in bare noun stems and
cliticized or compounded noun stems. The vowel length value is the middle
out of two tokens of each word uttered in isolation by a single speaker.

 /LHban-on/        [mba.nn]     165               ‘jaw bone’      CompoundingThe data in this table show that in certain contexts the vowels in /LHmn/
‘string bag’ and /Hmn/ ‘child’ are very similar in length, namely 155 ms vs.
140 ms. The reason for this is that the tonal melody in /LHmn/ ‘string bag’
does not show up as a contour when material cliticizes to the noun. In larger
tonal domains the tonal melody is spread over the whole domain (see sections
2.8.3.1 and 2.8.3.2).
    Therefore, Fedden (2007a) analyses the longer vowel in the uncliticized
form /LHmn/ ‘string bag’ to be a phonetic effect of the contour tone rather
than to assume a length distinction or a syllabification into two syllables.
Since contour tones, as opposed to level tones, take a certain time to be
realized, the vowel under the tone is lengthened. Thus vowel length becomes a
function of the tone (Weidert 1981: 66-68).
    Compounding has a similar effect on tonal melodies and vowel length. The
LH melody in /LHban/ [mbán] ‘jaw’ does not show up as a contour in the
compound /LH|banon/ [mbann] ‘jaw bone’ due to the specific tone
association rules involved here (see 2.8.2.3 and 2.8.3.3). Consequently, the
vowel, i.e. the pharyngealized /a/, is shortened.
    The same holds for contexts in which tone is completely neutralized, i.e.
when the tone pattern on two words becomes the same due to cliticization of
the predicator or an article. In table 2.4, vowel length value is the middle out
of two tokens of each word uttered in isolation by a single speaker.
    Table 2.4 suggests that the (near-)minimal pairs /Lokok/ vs. /LHmokok/ and
/ aft/ vs. /LHaft/, at the phonemic level, do not contrast in length but in tone.
 LThis indicates that the difference in vowel length is functionally unimportant.
    The phonetic lengthening of vowels is only conspicuous under rising
contours, i.e. the LH melody. Monosyllabic words with a HL contour, on the
other hand, do not show phonetic lengthening under the contour tone HL, e.g.
/HLfab/ ‘where’ (125ms) and /HLf/ ‘carrion’ (155ms), each single tokens
recorded in isolation.

 / aft=o= b/       [a.f.t.]     90           ‘it’s (been) cleared of a taboo’Vowel length can be also systematically related to other phenomena apart
from pitch. The role of pitch in vowel length does not explain why the vowel
in /Hmn/ ‘child’ is considerably longer (185 ms) than the vowel in the second
syllable in /Lajal/ ‘light’ (125 ms), as both have level tones, a high and a low
one, respectively. Similarly, the length difference between /LHit/ ‘penis’ (260
ms) and /LHkwit/ ‘sugar cane’ (185 ms) cannot be due to tone because both
bear the same LH melody.
    Some of these differences in length might be accounted for by relating
them to straightforward differences in syllable configuration. Throughout the
language, vowels in monosyllables are longer than vowels in syllables of
disyllables. Similarly, vowels in onset-less or coda-less syllables are longer
than vowels in syllables which have onsets or codas. It seems however less
probable that the absence or the presence of an onset, as in the pair /LHit/
‘penis’ (260 ms) vs. /LHkwit/ ‘sugar cane’ (185 ms) can indeed account for a
difference in duration of over 70ms.
    The data and the discussion in this section might suggest there is evidence
for a phonemic length distinction in Mian vowels. However, a systematic
analysis of vowel length is impeded by the fact that there are no minimal
length pairs and not many near-minimal length pairs. What’s worse, vowel
length is generally subject to considerable variation between speakers (up to
60ms in some cases), and even between different tokens of the same word
uttered by a single speaker (again up to 60 ms in some cases). This range of
free length variation makes it hard to assign a given vowel to a discrete ‘long’
or ‘short’ phonemic category when genuine minimal pairs are absent, and
near-minimal pairs are rare. Furthermore, at this stage, the data available for
analysis are not sufficient to make any statistically valid generalizations about
vowel length. For that, more tokens and especially more different speakers
recording these tokens are needed.

one in Fedden (2007a) in not assuming a phonemic length contrast, leaving
the question whether Mian has a phonemic length distinction in its vowels for
future research on the language’s phonetics and phonology.","[58, 59, 60, 61]"

8.7.2.     Verbal nounsVerbal nouns are formed by affixing -in to the perfective or the imperfective
M-form, e.g. fu-nam-in ‘(instance of) cooking (PFV VN)’, fu-m-in ‘(activity of)
cooking (IPFV VN)’. The verbal noun is the citation form for all verbs. Verbal
nouns are inflected for aspect with -nam in the perfective and -m in the
imperfective. Furthermore, they require any object(s) of the verb to be indexed
by an affix on the stem, regardless of whether a given object is part of the
basic or the derived argument structure of a verb. Hence, it is not possible to
just say ‘kill’ in Mian, one has to include the object and say ‘kill him’, ‘kill
them’, etc.:
                                                     Non-finite verb forms   317(205) i-nâ’-nam-in / *nâ’-nam-in
      PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-PFV-VN
      ‘(instance of) killing us/you/them (PFV VN)’When there is no referent for the object provided by the context, for instance
when a verb is cited, speakers by default use the third person singular
masculine or the animate plural form of an object affix in the verbal noun. For
example, if asked out of context what ‘see’ means, Mian speakers will answer
either (206) or (207):(206) a-têm’-nam-in
      3SG.M.O-see.PFV-PFV-VN
      ‘(instance of) seeing him (PFV VN)’(207) ya-têm’-nam-in
      PL.AN.O-see.PFV-PFV-VN
      ‘(instance of) seeing them (PFV VN)’Verbal nouns have the syntactic distribution of nouns and can occur as
subjects and objects and as possessors of another noun phrase. As nouns, they
are of neuter 2 gender and can take the article =o when used as arguments.
    Semantically, the perfective and imperfective verbal nouns differ in the
following way: The former denotes exactly one bounded event, e.g. onamin
‘(instance of) going (PFV VN)’, whereas the latter denotes one or more
unbounded events, e.g. unêmin ‘(activity of) going (IPFV VN)’. The following
two examples illustrate this semantic difference in an elicited minimal
sentence pair:(208) on-nam-in=o              fatnà=ta
      go.PFV-PFV-VN =N2        do_what=MED       dê’-bl-Ø-ib=e?
       desist.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=CQ

       desist.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Why aren’t you moving along (i.e. in a queue)?’
318    8. Verb morphologySmith and Weston (1974b: 65-66) call all verb forms in -in ‘customary’. This
meaning may be contained in the imperfective verbal noun, which can indeed
be used for recurring and habitual actions and events. In more general terms,
however, ‘customary’ is clearly a misnomer because imperfective verbal
nouns do not necessarily denote habitual or customary actions, e.g. unêmin
‘(activity of) going (IPFV VN)’ in (209) is simply continuous, nor do perfective
verbal nouns ever signify habitual actions.","[342, 343, 344]"

13.2.4.     Adverbial clauses with the article =oThese display clausal syntax, yet they are formally treated as noun phrases
because they always bear the article =o reflecting neuter 2 gender. Like
medial clauses, adverbial clauses can be topic-marked with =le as well. In the
following examples the adverbial clause appears enclosed in square brackets.
    The verbs in adverbial clauses are final verbs, i.e. they have their own
polarity value and can be inflected for irrealis. A temporal interpretation (24)
or a locative interpretation (25) is possible:(24)      [naka=i                   utl-Ø-ib=o]

13.2.5.     Topicalized adverbial clausesAdverbial clauses with the article =o can be marked as topical with the topic
clitic =le to indicate that a whole event is relevant to what follows:(28)      [          utlaan          dama-Ø-ib=o=le]

          ‘so when they grew up, they multiplied and then ...’ [Dimosson]In example (28), the topicality of the clause marked as the topic lies in the fact
that it is a necessary prerequisite for the event of the succeeding clause to take
place. Before humans can procreate they need to grow up.
                                                        13.2. Adverbial clauses   49713.2.6.     Adverbial clauses with the postpositions temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at
            the time when’Temwât ‘while’, which itself consists of the nominal postposition tem ‘in(to)’
(from the noun tem ‘inside’) and the directional wt ‘across’, can follow the
verb of an adverbial clause to specify that the event described by the
preceding clause is on-going at a certain point in time, at which another event
takes place so that both situations temporally overlap, at least partially. The
whole construction has to be marked as adverbial with the article =o.
Intonationally, temwât belongs to the adverbial clause. The characteristic
pause indicating the beginning of a new clause comes after, never before
temwât.(29)      [kbo      fút=e                gen-b-eb                    temwât=o]

       and then he…’ [Elicited as a contrast to (30)]This seems to be the original construction in which the free pronoun
functioning as a resumptive pronoun anaphorically refers to the proposition of
the whole preceding clause. It is plausible that (29) and (30) represent
successive stages of phonological erosion of this pronoun. While it is realized
as a toneless clitic in (30), it has completely disappeared in (29).
   Dim ‘at the time when’, which is basically a nominal postposition meaning
‘on(to)’ (from the noun dim ‘top’), can follow the verb of an adverbial clause
to specify that at a certain time while one situation holds true (e.g. a state), a
new situation comes in. Like adverbials with temwât ‘while’, the whole
construction has to be marked as an adverbial by =o. Intonationally, dim
belongs to the adverbial clause. The characteristic pause indicating the
beginning of a new clause comes after, never before dim.
   Dim shows those same three constructional variants, described above for
temwât. In (32), the variant with the free pronoun is illustrated here:(32)   [sinanggwâno       naka=i=a                unáng=a=i

neither a pronoun nor a clitic article:(33)      [n   áa      un-aamab-i                          dim=o]

13.2.7.    The semantic difference between temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at the
           time when’The semantic difference between adverbial clauses with temwât and dim is
subtle. While both indicate that two events overlap, the former is preferred, if
one wants to express that one event occurs inside another one and that there is
some interaction between participants or interference between the events. The
latter only indicates a temporal overlap. Compare the following two examples:(34)      [         miting          ke-b-ib=o                     temwât=o]

          ‘At the same time as they are having a meeting, I’m smoking.’ (i.e.
          outside the building, in my own house, etc.).’
500       13. Embedding13.3.       Relative clausesRelative clauses in Mian serve the function that many scholars have identified
for relative clauses in all languages, namely to delimit the potential reference
of a noun (e.g. Comrie 1981: 136). More specifically, a relative relation
involves two events (or states of affairs), a main and a dependent one, which
share exactly one participant. “[A] participant of the main SoA [State of
Affairs – SF] is identified within a set of possible referents by mentioning
some other SoA in which he or she takes part” (Cristofaro 2003: 195).
    Mian relative clauses are finite and can be either prenominal or head-
internal. There is no formal distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive
relative clauses. As the function of the latter ones is not to delimit potential
reference of a noun but rather to give additional information pertaining to the
referent in question, they are not covered by Comrie’s (1981) definition.
Nevertheless, this section also includes some examples of relative clauses
which are clearly of the non-restrictive type in English. In Mian the restrictive
vs. non-restrictive distinction is not formally expressed.","[521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526]"

5.8.     Verbs with obligatory classificatory prefixBelow are listed the most frequent verbs which require a classificatory prefix.
In a few cases, the classificatory prefix is frozen in the singular form of the
residue class ob-, e.g. ase ob-tanà/ase ob-tunu ‘light with fire’ and aaie ob-dî
‘fetch water’. In the case of the perfective-only stem -kilêb ‘put handle of bag
around forehead so that the bag hangs down the bag (in order to carry the
bag)’ the prefix is frozen as go- from the bundle class.(25)   -â’/—                 ‘leave, let’
       -atdi/—               ‘throw into fire’

       -usâ’/-uka          ‘put on (clothes)’
       -waa                ‘hide’Verbs with an obligatory classificatory prefix where the prefix has to index an
animate object are listed in (26).(26)   -klafâ/—     ‘put on back (piggy-back style)’
       -môu/—       ‘put on shoulder’ (pig or child)
       -silêb /—    ‘follow’
       -tamà/—      ‘pen in, imprison’
5.9.     Gender system vs. classification by prefixNominal categorization in Mian is complex due to the fact that two different
nominal classification systems, which show different formal and semantic
properties, exist next to and interact with each other.
   First, there is the category ‘gender’ with the masculine, feminine, neuter 1
and 2 subcategories. All pronominal affixes on the verb agree in person,
number and gender with the arguments they cross-reference. If the verb occurs
without overt noun phrase arguments, pronominal affixes agree anaphorically
with a previously mentioned overt noun phrase argument.
   These instances of agreement are predictable from the person, number and
gender of the nominal argument. In other words, pronominal affixes never
have any semantic impact on the noun or its noun phrase. Their function is to
indicate grammatical relations in the clause and to enable construal of any
overt arguments with their respective cross-referencing affix by showing
agreement.
   In addition, there are the categories (prefix classes) established by sets of
classificatory prefixes. There are four reasons why I consider this system of
classificatory prefixes to be different from the system of gender agreement.
   First, only some verbs with similar semantics of object manipulation or
handling participate in the system of classificatory prefixes, whereas
pronominal affixes can be found on all finite verbs.
196    5. Classificatory verb prefixes   Second, nominal classification by classificatory prefixes operates on an
absolutive basis, whereas the gender system does not.
   Third, formal means and semantic categorizations used by the two
classificatory systems are quite different (see below).
   Fourth, the system of classificatory prefixes has instances of ‘non-standard
agreement’, i.e. in certain contexts, choice of the prefix is not necessarily
predictable from formal features (e.g. gender) of a noun or semantic properties
(sex, shape) of its referent. Examples of this will be provided in 5.10 below.
Within the gender system, agreement patterns are always predictable from the
gender specification of a noun.
   Phonologically, classificatory prefixes are more complex than the
pronominal affixes which define the genders. First, almost all prefixes have
prefix variants conditioned by quite diverse phonological environments.
Second, two classificatory prefixes show vowel harmony with a following
vowel (see 2.7.1).
   Note also the differences in semantic split-up. In the gender system, the
main semantic distinctions are animacy and sex, establishing a masculine, a
feminine, and two neuter genders. The distinction between the neuter genders
is mainly a formal one between those nouns with a number contrast and those
without a number contrast, though one should recall that this is not exclusively
a formal distinction but also a semantic one since an overwhelming number of
N2-nouns, such as masses, locations, and abstract or intangible entities are
non-count nouns.
   In the system of classificatory prefixes, animacy/sex is also an important
categorization criterion but the M-class and the F-class contain many items
from the inanimate world. Moreover, shape (long object) and function
(bundle-like or covering object) are criteria for classification. The residue
class mainly contains inanimate nouns which are also of neuter 1 gender, but
not exclusively so (for example a few animates such as máab tóm ‘tortoise
species’) and the residue class is not co-extensive with this gender since many
neuter 1 nouns are classified as M-class, F-class, long, bundle, or covering by
the prefix system.
   To sum up, two nominal classification systems operate alongside each
other in Mian: (a) the gender system and (b) the system of classification
through classificatory verbal prefixes. The formal means employed by the
respective systems are clearly distinct and the semantic criteria for
classification yield two different ways of categorizing nouns.
                                                      5.10. Reclassification   1975.10.     ReclassificationReclassification refers to a different categorization of a noun due to the choice
of a different classificatory prefix in order, for example, to highlight a certain
feature of the referent. Reclassification in Mian mainly applies to nouns whose
referents are or can somehow be handled like bags, for instance bundles of
firewood or substantial chunks of pork which have a string or rope attached to
them. This characteristic of the referent is not expressed in the noun, but in the
classificatory prefix. An example of reclassification by using a different
classificatory prefix is given in (27) and (28):(27)    éil=o      om-fâ-n-e=be
        pork=N2 3SG.F_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He put down the (piece of) pork.’(28)    éil=o     gol-meki-n-e=be
        pork=N2 3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hung up the (piece of) pork (on a string).’In this case, the semantic impact of the classificatory prefixes of the bundle
class is hard to miss. The information that the referent of the object, namely
the meat, comes with a string or rope attached so that it can be carried around
or hung up like a bag or bundle does not reside in the noun itself, nor is it
included in the semantics of the verb stem. It might be argued that the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’ necessarily takes gol-/gulel- as a prefix because its
semantics suggest that in order to hang something up it must be bundle-like or
at least have a handle. However, sosbên, a Tok Pisin loan which refers to
metal pots of various sizes with handles, cannot occur with the bundle class
prefixes, even though the action of hanging them up can be referred to by
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’:(29)    sosbên=e     ob-meki-n-e=be / *gol-meki-n-e=be
        pot=SG.N1    3SG.RESID.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hung up the pot.’Thus, the “hang-upability” of referents of objects of the verb -meki ‘hang up
(PFV)’ is more a selectional restriction of this verb rather than having anything
to do with the presence of the bundle class prefixes gol-/gulel-.
    In general the choice of a different prefix subtly changes the semantics of
an utterance. Compare:
198    5. Classificatory verb prefixes(30)   som=e
       banana_bunch=SG.N1       dob-meki-n-e=be
       3SG.M_CL.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up the banana bunch (e.g. the whole bunch on a nail).’(31)   som=e

       3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up the banana bunch (to which a string or rope is
       attached).’In (31), som=e ‘a/the banana bunch’ is reclassified as a bundle-like object.
Although the object is the same in (30) and (31), namely som=e in both cases,
the choice of prefixes indicates that in the former example the bunch of
bananas itself is hung over a hook or nail whereas in the latter example the
bunch has some string or rope attached to it, which is slipped over a hook or
nail.
   Example (31) can also have a different meaning, namely that the referent
of the object is a bag full of bananas. Bundle class prefixes can indicate that
the referent of the object is contained in a bag:(32)   tóm=e          gol-meki-n-e=be
       stone=SG.N1    3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up a bag full of stones.’If several bags are involved, the difference in number is expressed on the
article and on the verbal prefix, but the fact that the objects are in a bag is
solely conveyed by the bundle class prefix:(33)   tóm=o           gol-meki-n-e=be
       stone=PL.N1     PL.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I hung up bags full of stones.’The reclassification of a noun as bundle-like is not restricted to the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’. This can be seen in the following example:
                                                       5.10. Reclassification   199(34)   mn=e            y        gol-ò-n-e=a

       ‘It (the wild boar) takes the boy (with the umbilical cord), and then…’
       [Afoksitgabáam]This sentence is from a story in which a pregnant woman is savaged by a wild
boar who tears her open, takes her unborn son, still attached to the umbilical
cord (the handle, so to say), and throws him on the ground. (The whole story
can be found in the text collection in appendix 1.)
   Reclassification of yóum ‘piece of clothing’, which is by default M-class
(35), to the covering class is exemplified in (36):(35)   yóum=e                         tek      dim=e
       piece_of_clothing=SG.N1        rope     on=SG.N1       do-fâ-n-ebo=be

        PL.COVER.O-remove.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘You undressed (lit. ‘removed your clothes).’What the reclassification of ‘clothes’ effects in this case is the highlighting of
the fact that they had covered a person’s body before they were removed, as
stated in the utterance in (36) above.
    Another example of reclassification is provided in (37):(37)            tob-ò-n-e=a
       3SG.M 3SG.LONG.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he took it (i.e. his long penis) and then ...’ [Selimin]In this example, the classificatory prefix tob- refers anaphorically back to the
previously mentioned éit ‘penis’, which is assigned to the residue class by
default. However, in order to emphasize the enormous length of the
protagonist’s member, the speaker uses the prefix of the long class.
    All of these examples illustrate that reclassification can be used quite
creatively in Mian.
200       5. Classificatory verb prefixes5.10.1.     Plurals of inanimate nouns of neuter 1 genderThe noun éim ‘pandanus fruit’ is classified by default as belonging to the
M-class and occurs with the prefixes dob-/dol-. However, when one wants to
refer to considerable numbers of these fruits, the residue plural prefix ol- is
used. The same happens with long objects which are normally classified as
long and occur with tob-/tebel-. If their numbers exceed a few, the plural
prefix ol- of the residue class is employed:(38)      kbo       geim=o                  tebel-ubmà

5.10.2.     Use of F-class singular om- for broken and half objectsFor inanimate referents which are broken, the prefix om- is always possible as
an alternative to the bundle, covering, long, and residue class prefixes:(40)      mén=o

          3SG.F_CL.O-be_concerned.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘I am concerned about the (heap of torn) string bags.’
                                                      5.10. Reclassification   201In this case, the use of the F-class singular prefix om- focuses on the fact that
the objects in question are indeed broken and thus not treated as individual
items anymore but more like a heap or a mass.
    The prefix om- is also employed for halves of formerly whole objects.
Compare:(42)   imen=e        ob-Øˆ-nen=e!
       taro=SG.N1 3SG.RESID.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
       ‘Give me the taro!’(43)   imen=e        om-Øˆ-nen=e!
       taro=SG.N1 3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
       ‘Give me the half taro!’Again, the examples (42) and (43) are instances of reclassification. The
semantic features ‘broken mass’ or ‘half’ are not expressed in the noun but lie
exclusively in the classificatory prefix.

The noun phrase
6.0.     IntroductionMian noun phrase syntax is rigid. All noun phrases conform to the following
structural template, which specifies the structure of maximally complex noun
phrases:           Prenominal
Possessor
             adjective
                           Head     Postnominal
  Prenominal relative                              Quantifier   Determiner
                           noun     adjective(s)
        clause
  Prenominal modifierThe head noun slot can only hold an item of the category N, which includes
verbal nouns. A pronoun can instantiate a full noun phrase. Headless
adjectives can constitute a noun phrase of their own. In that case the head
noun slot is empty.
   Any material filling the possessor slot must be either a possessive pronoun
or a noun phrase. The prenominal adjective slot can accommodate one
adjective of the two sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’. The head noun can be
preceded by a prenominal relative clause or by one of two prenominal
modifiers omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’. In these cases there must
not be a possessor. The postnominal adjective slot can be filled by one or
more adjectives. Postnominal adjectives are followed by quantifiers. The
determiner slot can be filled by the article or any of those pronouns which can
be used adnominally (Himmelmann 1997: 215-219).
   Table 6.1 lists examples illustrating noun phrases of different complexity.
All of these structures are discussed below. For a short overview of relative
clauses, see 6.3.8. For a detailed description of relative clauses, see 13.3.
   The normal situation in natural Mian discourse is that the clitic article
occurs only once on the rightmost constituent of a noun phrase that is used
referentially:(1)    tíl     milil     sm=e
       dog     black     big=SG.M

noun phrase. It can show up on the noun itself, and on any adjectival
modifiers:(2)        tíl=e          milil=e        sm=e
           dog=SG.M black=SG.M           big=SG.M
           ‘a/the big, black dog’
6.1.         Pronouns as noun phrasesThe forms of all pronoun series (except the possessive pronoun) can be used
pronominally, i.e. they can constitute noun phrases by themselves. For details
on the form and the semantics of the respective pronoun series and for more
examples, see 3.7.
    All of these can occur in subject position. Free pronouns occasionally
occur in object position whereas the other pronoun series are so far only
attested in subject position.
    Forms from either of the reflexive series appear as objects if their function
is to indicate reflexivity:(3)        n     nmaye/neleskîl     gò’-Ø-i-obe

English ‘I myself killed the pig’, the pronoun can appear in apposition to an
overt subject noun phrase, as in (4) or on its own in lieu of an overt subject
noun phrase, as in (5):(4)      naka    le                  -maye            éil=o

                                       3.11. Conjunctions and subordinators   1493.11.      Conjunctions and subordinatorsThe inventory of conjunctions and subordinators is rather small. Being a
clause-chaining language with morphologically rich medial verbs, Mian
mainly relies on the marking of sequentiality or simultaneity in medial verbs
to indicate temporal semantic relations between clauses for which English
uses conjunctions like then, after, when, as, while, etc. Adverbial clauses
without overt subordinators can have a range of semantic relations (namely
temporal, locative, or conditional) to their matrix clause. On adverbial clauses,
see 13.2. On the use of the postpositions temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at the time
when’, as conjunctions in embedded adverbial clauses, see 13.2.6.
   The word class of conjunctions and subordinators comprises:(168) eka                ‘and’
      =a                 ‘and’ (< eka)
      bleka              ‘or’
      otâne              ‘but’
      kesoa              ‘because, since’
      bita               ‘until’
      mole               ‘if’Mian is a typical verb-final language since subordinators (kesoa ‘because’,
bita ‘until’, mole ‘if’) occur in clause-final position (Dryer 2007: 100). Co-
ordinating conjunctions (eka and =a ‘and’, bleka ‘or’, otâne ‘but’) are
prosodically a part of the first conjunct.
3.11.1.    eka ‘and’The conjunction eka ‘and’ is strictly coordinating, i.e. it can only be used if
two expressions are of the same syntactic order, e.g. both are noun phrases
(169), adjectival modifiers (170), or clauses (171):(169) Memin        i=e           eka Daning i=e                eka
          PN       father=SG.M    and PN          father=SG.M and
          ‘both Memin’s father and Daning’s father’ (Smith and Weston
          1974b: 99)(170) sob=e             ngáamein eka          beitlok=o=be
      soap=SG.N1        yellow       and      soft=PRD=DECL
      ‘The soap is yellow and soft.’
150       3. Word classes and grammatical relations(171) bi-n-o=a                               eka   imín

          come.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘she stayed and then came back and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]In (171), eka is redundant and binoa imin tenoa is also possible. I assume that
the medial verb clitic =a is derived from the coordinating clitic =a ‘and’,
which in turn is a shortened form of eka ‘and’. The coordinating clitic =a
‘and’ is used to coordinate noun phrases (see 6.7 for examples).
3.11.2.     bleka ‘or’The conjunction bleka ‘or’ is used to coordinate maximally two noun phrases,
as in (172), or clauses (173). In the latter case, the verb of the first clause
appears without an illocutionary clitic:(172) kbo           éil    -ta               bleka   aning    -ta
      2SG.M          pig    SG.N1-EMPH         or      fish     SG.N1-EMPH          dowôn’-aamab-eb=a?

          ‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’(173) kbo            memâlo       bib       bi-aamab-eb
      2SG.M           today        village   stay.IPFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ           bleka    damìb      un-aamab-eb=a?
           or       garden     go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
          ‘Are you going to stay in the village or go to the garden today?’Coordination of three or more alternatives is unattested. On bleka ‘or’ in polar
questions, see section 10.1.2.
3.11.3.     otâne ‘but’The conjunction otâne ‘but’ coordinates two clauses. The verb in the first
clause has final verb morphology, i.e. it can be inflected for irrealis and
deontic mood but appears without an illocutionary marker (174):
                                          3.11. Conjunctions and subordinators   151(174) sinta             imen=o         fu-n-amab-i

          ‘Yesterday, I wanted to cook taro but they were bad and I left them.’
          (Smith and Weston 1974b: 131)
3.11.4.     kesoa ‘because, since’The causal conjunction kesoa ‘because, since’ invariably occurs after the verb
and intonationally belongs to this clause, which gives the reason. The
consequence is given in the succeeding clause, which forms its own
intonational unit:(175) [milimsîn=e                 háang-an-Ø-e                      kesoa] IU
      other_side=SG.N1            dry-VBLZ-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ          because          [tob-ski-n-amab-i=be] IU
          3SG.LONG.O-turn-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘Because the other side has dried, I’ll turn it (the tobacco leaf)
          around.’ [Rolling smokes]The conjunction kesoa is probably derived from a verb that constituted its own
medial clause in a clause chain. Verbal morphology including S/R marking
with -s ‘DS.SEQ’, and medial verb marking with the clitic =a is still clearly
discernible. The most likely candidate for the verb stem is the function verb ke
‘do’, thus ke-s-o=a [do-DS.SEQ-EXPL=MED]. Intonationally, however, kesoa
does not constitute its own clause anymore and the verb preceding kesoa
allows final verb morphology, i.e. inflection for polarity, mood, and
inchoative aspect (176) are permitted:(176) me-m-e                      kesoa
      cry.IPFV-INCH-3SG.M.SBJ     because
      ‘because he was crying’ [Crows]On the other hand, kesoa retains some features of an erstwhile medial clause.
Apart from the medial verb marker =a, =ta is also possible (kesota). As the
152       3. Word classes and grammatical relationsexact semantic difference between these two variants is unclear at this stage I
gloss them both as ‘because’.
3.11.5.     bita ‘until’The temporal conjunction bita ‘until’ expresses that the event described in the
preceding clause continues up to the onset of the event in the succeeding
clause:(177) deib=o            on        bl-Ø-ib                         bita
      road=N2           go.PFV    stay.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ     until          bita       wàt-n-ib=ta
          until      across-SS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
          ‘they went and stayed (where they had gone to) until they went
          across (i.e. to Telefomin), and then they …’ [Mianmin and
          Telefomin]The conjunction bita ‘until’ very likely goes back to a shortened medial verb
form consisting of the existential verb bi and the medial clitic =ta. On such
shortened medial verb forms, see 11.2.13.
3.11.6.     mole ‘if’The conjunction mole ‘if’ is used in conditionals. An example is provided in
(178). For details on conditionals, see section 13.2.1.(178) y                      went-Ø-ib                         mole

                                                         3.12. Ideophones   1533.12.     IdeophonesIdeophones are sound-symbolic words that evoke certain perceptions and
sensations in a direct and vivid way (Dingemanse 2009). Ideophones are very
often phonologically peculiar. In Mian, they are phonologically marked in that
they often involve full reduplication, e.g. bangbang ‘clap’, bokbok ‘bubble’ or
partial reduplication, e.g. blele ‘fly’, fluluk ‘flutter (of a small bird)’.
Reduplication with ablaut is also attested, e.g. dingdung ‘hollow,
reverberating sound’, nikitneket ‘creak’, and fliliflala ‘blaze’. None of these
phonological characteristics are typical of any other word class. Semantically,
most ideophones refer to types of sound or types of movement. The corpus
contains roughly 60 ideophones (not counting linguistic renderings of animal
cries).
    Ideophones always immediately precede the main verb. They are further
subdivided into four classes depending on which type of verb they precede:   (i)      function verb ge/ga ‘say’
   (ii)     function verb ge/ga ‘say’ or existential verb n/bi~bl
   (ii)     motion verb, e.g. un~on/unê ‘go’, tl-~te/tle ‘come’
   (iv)     function verb ge/ga ‘say’ or motion verbIdeophones that refer to types of motion are adverb-like because they express
the manner of movement. In contrast to adverbs proper, ideophones are
syntactically fixed in front of the verb associated with them. Compare:(179) Milsen=e      blublu      un-Ø-e=be
      PN=M.SG       run         go.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘Milsen ran.’(180) *blublu Milsene unebeMany adverbs, on the other hand, are more mobile within the clause. Although
they tend to immediately precede the verb, as in (181), other positions are
possible, barring the position after the verb, as shown in (182):(181) n      imen=e           hebmamsâb       wen-b-i=be
      1SG     taro=SG.N1       quickly         eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I’m eating a taro quickly.’(182) (hebmamsâb) n (hebmamsâb) imen=e (hebmamsâb) wen-b-i=be
      (*hebmamsâb) ‘I’m eating a taro quickly.’
154       3. Word classes and grammatical relationsIdeophones form fixed expressions with their associated verbs and do not
occur on their own, with the exception of bird cries. Thus, bangbang just
represents a clapping sound. Verbal nouns have to be used to refer to instances
of clapping or the activity of clapping:(183) bangbang       ge-nam-in
      clap           say.PFV-PFV-VN
      ‘(an instance of) clapping’(184) bangbang        ga-l-in
      clap            say.IPFV-IPFV-VN
      ‘(activity of) clapping’
3.12.1.     With function verb ge/ga ‘say’The use of ideophones with the function verb ge/ga ‘say’ is illustrated in
examples (185) and (186):(185) fong             ge-s-ib=a
      whistle          say.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED          wentê-n-ib=a

      sizzle     say.IPFV-AUX.IPFV-SEQ-3SG.N1.SBJ= MED
      ‘it (some meat) was sizzling and then ...’ [Crows]Most of the ideophones in this class refer to sounds. The inventory consists of:
bangbang ‘clap’, bangklibbangklib ‘rotate, revolve’, beng ‘fart (quietly)’,
biang ‘slap’, blala ‘flash of lightning’, blili ‘crackle (of aggressively blazing
fire)’, bling ‘shine’, blout ‘sound of opening wings’, bluatbluat ‘spin’, bua/bui
‘eagle’s cry’, buk ‘fart (loud)’, dlatdlat ‘fast movement of snake’s tongue’,
dungdung ‘drum’, duk ‘swallow’, dut ‘glow bright in the dark’, fitfit ‘shake

3.14.1.   SubjectMorphologically, the grammatical relation of subject is indexed on the verb by
a pronominal suffix in all finite verb forms:(212) haleb         -ta             te-s-e=a
      wild_boar     3SG.M-EMPH       come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
      ‘a wild boar came and then she ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]Syntactically, the subject is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the subject index on
the verb, in (212) haleb ta ‘the wild boar’. The subject noun phrase is not
overtly case-marked. The subject has special syntactic status in Mian because
it is the pivot of the switch-reference system of the language. Semantically,
subjects are typically topics and agents but subjects can also be experiencers
or expletives (i.e. dummy subjects in impersonal verbs). Subject suffixes are
discussed in 8.5.2.
164       3. Word classes and grammatical relations3.14.2.     ObjectMian has a single grammatical relation of object, which can be
morphologically indexed in different ways, so that the indexing patterns on the
verb do not correspond to the grammatical relations which can be established
on syntactic grounds. All objects can be modified, quantified, topicalized and
questioned. All objects can be relativized as well, but the relativization options
are subject to some restrictions for verbs which do not index their object. This
will be discussed in more detail below.
   In all cases, the object is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the object index on
the verb. Object noun phrases are never overtly case-marked. The way objects
are indexed on the verb depends on lexical factors. There are four distinct
patterns of object indexation.
   First, the object can be marked by a pronominal prefix according to an
accusative pattern, e.g.:(213) no=i
      marsupial=PL.AN          ya-l-êt-n-e=ta
          PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
          ‘he killed and brought/carried the marsupials and then ...’ [Crows]Semantically, objects indexed with a pronominal prefix mostly have the role
of patient.
    Second, the object can be marked by a classificatory prefix according to an
absolutive pattern, i.e. the object of a transitive verb (214) or the subject of an
intransitive verb (215) are indexed, e.g.:(214) ti=e                 báangkli=e
      blade=SG.M            stone_adze=SG.M          deb-êt-n-o=a
          3SG.M_CL.O-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘she carried a báangkli adze and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam](215) Dabein       om-mêin                   tl-Ø-o=ta
          PN       3SG.F-CL.SBJ-fall.PFV     come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘Dabein came falling down (i.e. from the sky) and ...’ [Sofelok, 1]
                                              3.14. Grammatical relations   165Semantically, objects indexed with a classificatory prefix mostly have the role
of theme or patient.
    Third, the object can be marked by a pronominal suffix according to an
indirective pattern. In the perfective, the suffix must be appended to -ûb’-
‘give’, which is compounded with another verb. In the imperfective,
suffixation is directly to the stem. For a detailed description, see 8.5.5.(216) unáng=o         baa-ˆb’-o-n-e=o=le
      woman=SG.F say.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=N2=TOP
      ‘and when he said to the woman’ [Pig story]Such objects most commonly have the role of recipient, benefactive,
malefactive, possessor, or experiencer. Finally, there are verbs which never
mark their object, e.g.:(217) unín=o        dowôn’-Ø-i=a
      food=N2       eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘I eat food and then someone else ...’ [Newlyweds]In this case, there is no indicator on the verb which makes the object relation
explicit, so the object is the noun phrase which is not indexed on the verb. In
most cases animacy differences (objects of verbs without object prefix are
overwhelmingly inanimate) and the semantics and context of the whole
utterance also help identify the object. Furthermore, many verbs without an
object prefix only occur with a relatively small range of possible object noun
phrases, as in the case of halbû’ ‘fold (IPFV)’, or even only with a single
possible object noun phrase (as in the case of êi ‘accumulate, impound
(water)’ or kè ‘cut (scraped taro) into slabs’, for which the objects can only
ever be aai ‘water’ and imen nini ‘scraped taro’, respectively.
    The absence of the prefix on these verbs has a syntactic consequence.
When a verb does not index its object relativization with a prenominal relative
clause is impossible and relativization with a head-internal relative clause is
only possible if the head is not omitted. This is illustrated in the following
examples. A prenominal relative clause is not allowed when the object is not
indexed, as in (218), but is fine when it is indexed, as in (219):(218) *n     fu-n-i                    unín=o         ayam=o=be
      1SG     cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ         food=N2        good=PRD=DECL
      Intended: ‘The food I’ve cooked is good.’(219) n        a-têm’-Ø-i                         naka=e
      1SG       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ       man=SG.M
166    3. Word classes and grammatical relations       teke=o=be
       long=PRD=DECL
       ‘The man I see is tall.’In a head-internal relative clause the head must not be left out, if the verb does
not index the object, as in (220):(220) *n     fu-n-i=o                      ayam=o=be
      1SG     cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ=N2          good=PRD=DECL
      Intended: ‘What I’ve cooked is good.’Examples (221) and (222) show that a head-internal relative clause is possible
whether the overt object noun phrase is present or not, if the verb indexes its
object.(221) n       naka=e             a-têm’-Ø-i=e
      1SG      man=SG.M           3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M       teke=o=be

       ‘The man I see is tall.’(222) n     a-têm’-Ø-i=e                                   teke=o=be
      1SG    3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M              long=PRD=DECL
      ‘The one (M) I see is tall.’If the head is present, a head-internal relative clause is possible, even if the
verb does not index its object, as in (223):(223) n      unín=o     fu-n-i=o                        ayam=o=be
      1SG     food=N2 cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ=N2               good=PRD=DECL
      ‘The food I’ve cooked is good.’The evidence suggests that relativization is only allowed, if the relativized
object is present in the clause in some way or other, either as a prefix or as an
overt noun phrase. Thus, the syntactic effect correlates with a morphological
effect, namely the presence or absence of the prefix. As this is more a
morphological issue than a syntactic one I do not see a reason why the non-
subject noun phrases of verbs like fu ‘cook’, which do not cross-reference this
noun phrase with a prefix, should not be objects.
   To sum up, Mian has one grammatical relation of object, which can be
marked in three different ways. The object can also be not marked on the verb.

12.2.        PolarityLike illocutionary force, positive polarity, which is unmarked, and negative
polarity marked by =ba on a final verb in a clause chain are interpreted as
having scope over the whole clause chain:(9)     a.             ayam     bi-Ø-e=a
               3SG.M    good     stay.IPFV-SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED        b.     bib      lo

               PL.AN.O-see.PFV-DEONT-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG       because
               ‘because he wasn’t well and couldn’t walk around this place
               and see them, …’ [Crows]
476     12. Operator scope in clause chaining constructionsIf the medial clause in clause (a) occurred in a clause chain whose final verb
was not marked with =ba to indicate negative polarity, its meaning would be
‘he was well’. Due to the scope of negation over whole clause chains,
however, this interpretation is impossible for (9).
    As the polarity specification must not change within a clause chain, two
independent sentences have to be used in order to say something like ‘He
didn’t see Asuneb, he saw Beitab’, for example:(10)             Asuneb=e=mo
        3SG.M     PN=SG.M=NEG        a-têm’-Ø-e=ba=be
        3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL                   Beitab       -ta
        3SG.M       PN           3SG.M-EMPH        a-têm’-Ø-e=be
        3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hasn’t seen Asuneb. He saw Beitab.’Medial verbs can never be marked for negative polarity with =ba. A clause
chain in which a medial verb is marked as negative is ungrammatical:(11)    *        Asuneb=e=mo
        3SG.M     PN=SG.M=NEG        a-têm’-n-e=ba=ta
        3SG.M.O-see.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=MED        Beitab   -ta              a-têm’-Ø-e=be

        Intended: ‘He didn’t see Asuneb, he saw Beitab.’
12.3.     TenseTense is marked by either pre-subject slot suffixes (-b(H) ‘Non-hodiernal past’
and -s ‘Remote past’) or post-subject slot suffixes (-bio ‘General past’ and -so
‘Hesternal past’). All of these are absolute tense markers, i.e. they locate an
event with respect to the moment of speaking. In final verbs, the tense suffixes
                                                                12.3. Tense    477in the post-subject slot, -bio ‘General past’ and -so ‘Hesternal past’, only co-
occur with -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’ in the pre-subject slot.","[501, 502, 503]"

the possessive pronoun with nominal function, e.g. n-mi ‘mine’ (from the
simple series), and the ‘alone’-possessive pronoun with nominal function, e.g.
kleb-mi ‘yours alone’ (from the ‘alone’-series). Table 3.13 lists all forms.
Grey areas indicate the absence of a gender contrast.
   The possessive pronoun with nominal function can appear in the predicate
of a non-verbal clause to assert ownership, as in (117):(117) le                     nmi=be

1.3.        Typological profileMian has a relatively small segmental phoneme inventory though of fairly
typical shape and size by Papuan standards. An unusual feature of the
segmental inventory is the presence of a contrast between a plain /a/ (spelled
<a>) and a pharyngealized /a/ (spelled <aa>). The tonal phonology is
complex. Mian is a word tone language, i.e. the domain for the assignment of
                                                        1.3. Typological profile   7one of five tonal melodies (H, L, LH, LHL, and HL) is the phonological word,
not the syllable. Lexemes are specified for one tonal melody and an accent
which serves as the anchor point for the melody. Tonal melodies spread over
the entire phonological word including all affixes and most clitics. Verbal and
nominal compounds are treated as a single word phonologically, i.e. they have
one tonal melody (i.e. a composite of both stem tones) and one accent. The
tonal inventory of compounds is a proper subset of the tonal melodies found
on monomorphemic words. While the function of tone is mainly to make
lexical distinctions, there is one tense (the non-hodiernal past) which is
marked tonally for some verbs in addition to a suffix.
   There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional
noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the
noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it
indicates an associative plural. If a noun is used referentially, it is followed by
a cliticized article which is etymologically related to the third person free
pronouns. There is a tendency to use inanimate nouns without this marker,
even if they are used referentially. There are several derivational noun
suffixes which derive adverbs from nouns and express meanings like
instrumental, e.g. sbun-dum ‘with a spoon’. Furthermore, there is a
derivational suffix -an, which attaches to either nouns or adjectives to form
verbs. The meaning is inchoative, e.g. ayam ‘good’ and ayam-an- ‘become
good’. These derived forms are further inflected as intransitive verbs.
   Mian has four genders: Masculine, feminine, neuter 1 and neuter 2 which
are defined by sets of agreement markers. Agreement targets are the
adnominally used pronouns, the article and demonstratives, and the
pronominal affixes on the verb.
   The structure of the noun phrase is relatively simple and constituent order
within the noun phrase is fixed. The leftmost position is the possessor slot. It
can be filled by a possessive pronoun or a noun phrase expressing the
possessor. Most adjectival modifiers and quantifiers follow the noun. The
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ tend to precede the noun but they can
also follow it. The rightmost position in the noun phrase is reserved for a
determiner, e.g. a clitic pronominal article or an adnominally used emphatic
pronoun. The clitic article can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and
show up on the head noun, all adjectival modifiers, and on numerals. Mian has
prenominal and head-internal relative clauses. The former are unmarked
clauses embedded in the noun phrase before the head noun, the latter are
essentially clausal noun phrases and end with a determiner, such as an article.
   Mian only has postpositions many of which have a noun origin.
   About half of the Mian verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with
formally distinct perfective and imperfective stems. This is a typical feature of
the Ok languages and also found in Telefol and Tifal. Outside of Ok, aspect
8   1. The language and its speakersdistinctions in the stem can be found in the Papuan languages Marind and
Kiwai (Foley 1986: 146-148), in Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and in Abui
(Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86). Some verb stems (approximately 50) are defective
and lack either the perfective or the imperfective stem. The rest of the verb
stems are trans-aspectual and do not have a formal perfective-imperfective
distinction.
    Verbal morphology is complex. Mian is mainly a nominative-accusative
language though in a limited number of cases argument marking proceeds on
an absolutive basis, mainly – but not exclusively – with classificatory prefixes,
which index transitive objects and intransitive subjects. Alignment in
ditransitives is indirective.
    Mian is basically head-marking at the clause level and mildly
polysynthetic. Core arguments are subject (S) in intransitive clauses, subject
(A) and object (O) in monotransitive clauses, and subject (A), object (O) and
recipient (R) in ditransitive clauses. There is no morphological case- or
adpositional marking for these. Core arguments are cross-referenced on the
verb by cross-referencing affixes. These index all subjects and recipients. The
language is not fully head-marking at the clause level because many transitive
verbs do not index their object. Object prefixation is only found in a small
number of transitive verbs, including ‘see’, ‘kill’, ‘grab’, and ‘bite’.
    In the perfective, recipient arguments are introduced through a compound
construction with -(û)b’- ‘give’, or allomorphs thereof. In contemporary Mian,
-(û)b’- ‘give’ and its allomorphs serve a quasi-applicative function. In the
imperfective, recipient suffixes immediately follow the verb stem. The notion
of ‘recipient’ is semantically relatively general and includes benefactives and
malefactives, possessors, goals of ballistic motion, and experiencers.
    In addition to the argument affixes, which work on a nominative-
accusative basis, Mian has a set of classificatory verb prefixes which are
obligatory for some verbs, most of which involve the handling or
manipulation of objects, including predications such as ‘take’, ‘throw’, ‘give’,
and ‘fall’. The classificatory prefixes classify a verbal argument according to
semantic criteria, such as biological sex but also shape and function on an
absolutive basis, i.e. classification extends to the subject of intransitive verbs
and the object of transitive verbs. These prefixes are in many ways
reminiscent of classificatory verbal elements in various North-American
languages, e.g. Navajo and Diegueño.
    Inflectional tense, aspect, and mood marking is moderately complex. The
verb has two slots for TAM suffixes which are on either side of the subject
suffix slot. The pre-subject slot is filled by various tense, aspect, and mood
markers. The post-subject slot can only be filled by tense markers (which are
formally and semantically distinct from those in the pre-subject slot). There
                                                        1.3. Typological profile   9are some co-occurrence restrictions pertaining to the suffixes in these two
slots.
    Verbs are inflected directly for some TAM categories, but for others the
verb must be serialized with an auxiliary before the respective TAM suffixes
can attach.
    Mian makes pervasive use of chaining constructions. Verbs can be
serialized at the core or the nuclear level of the clause. Serialized verbs share
the same subject which is marked on the last verb in the construction. An
exception is the causative serial verb construction, in which subject marking
indexes the causer on the first verb of the serialization and the causee on the
second verb. The predications expressed by a core serial verb constructions
are of relatively low semantic integration and serialized transitive verbs
commonly have their own overt object noun phrases. Serializations on the
nuclear level of the clause are possible. They are tighter-knit than core
serializations and do not allow separate objects.
    Clause chaining is very common in Mian. Verbs can be medial and
function as the predicate of a medial clause or final and function as the
predicate of an independent sentence or the last clause in a clause chain.
Medial verbs show switch-reference morphology indicating whether the
subject of the succeeding clause is co-referent or disjoint in reference, in
addition to marking events as sequential or simultaneous. In languages that
use clause chaining, medial verbs are often morphologically impoverished.
Mian medial verbs, however, only have the morphological restriction that they
cannot be marked for polarity, irrealis or deontic mood or be followed by one
of the sentence-final illocutionary clitics. The Mian switch-reference system
has a typologically unusual property in that ‘same subject’ marking by -n only
forces the following subject to be co-referent in the first person singular. In all
other person-number combinations the switch-reference meaning of -n is
suspended and the suffix only indicates sequentiality of events.
    Adverbial clauses with temporal, locative or conditional meaning – like
head-internal relative clauses – are clausal noun phrases and function as
referring expressions in Mian. They are followed by the default neuter article
=o. Other embedded structures found in the language are embedded questions
and quotatives.
    Unmarked constituent orders in medial and final clauses and independent
sentences are SV and AOV. Due to the head-marking characteristics of the
language, constituent order is relatively flexible with the mandatory restriction
that the verb be clause-final. The verb can only be followed by =ba, signalling
negative polarity, and/or an illocutionary clitic particle, which marks
independent sentences or whole clause chains as declarative, exclamative,
interrogative, quotative, or hortative. Post-verbal locative adverbials following
motion verbs are possible but rare and always constitute their own intonational

9.2.2.    Transitives with object prefix (accusative alignment)Subclass 2 of transitive verbs contains those with an obligatory object prefix
which signals person, number, and (in the third person) the gender of the
object. These verb stems are given in (21). The formal details of pronominal
object prefixes are covered in section 8.5.5.(21)     -e          ‘hit, kill (IPFV)’
         -fû’        ‘grab (PFV)’
         -lò         ‘hit, kill (PFV)’
         -nâ’        ‘hit, kill (PFV)’
         -ntamâ’     ‘bite (PFV)’
         -têm’       ‘see (PFV)’
         -temê’      ‘look at (IPFV)’This type of argument marking shows accusative alignment. The subjects of
intransitive verbs (S) and transitive verbs (A) are treated in the same way,
different from the object of transitive verbs (O). The accusative alignment
pattern is illustrated by comparing an intransitive verb (22) with a transitive
verb (23):(22)     yle    on-s-io=be
         well    go.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
         ‘Well, they went.’ [Pig story](23)     yle    éil=e          a-nâ’-s-ib=e?
         well    pig=SG.M 3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=Q
         ‘Well, did they kill the pig?’ [Mianmin and Telefomin history]
342      9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseIn (23) above, the object is marked on the verb with the pronominal affix a-
‘third person singular masculine’. The overt object noun phrase can be elided
without affecting the grammaticality of the utterance, as in (24):(24)     a-nâ’-s-ib=e?
         3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=Q
         ‘Well, did they kill him?’
9.2.3.     Transitives with object suffix (indirective aligment)Subclass 3 of transitive verbs consists of verbs which index their object with a
pronominal object suffix. In the perfective, such objects can only be
introduced into the argument structure of a verb through a compound with
-ûb- ‘give (PFV)’, to which the object suffix is appended. In the imperfective,
object suffixes directly attach to the stem (see section 8.5.5). If a verb
obligatorily has an object suffix, this is indicated by a dash following the stem,
e.g. fote- ‘chase away, rout’ (25) or dei-/— ‘leave’ (26).(25)     y         Klefol=i         tata      ke-n-ib=a

         ‘because he was utterly terrified, …’ (lit. ‘his soul left him there and
         went’) [Crows]
                                                           9.2. Transitives   343As verbs of this type always need -ûb- ‘give (PFV)’ with an applicative
function in the perfective, they look derived. However, they – at least
synchronically – do not have an intransitive base from which they could be
derived, i.e. there is no verb *fote, cf. example (25).
    All verb stems that belong to subclass 3 of transitive verbs are given in the
list below:(27)   al tlia-   ‘be angry (PFV)’
       atli-      ‘be angry (IPFV)’
       da-        ‘help’
       dei-       ‘leave (PFV)’
       doko-      ‘forget (PFV)’
       en-        ‘pain, hurt (IPFV)’
       fote-      ‘chase away, rout’
       gai-       ‘pass, surpass (PFV)’
       go-        ‘like, appreciate (PFV)’
       mele-      ‘touch, feel (PFV)’
       men-       ‘touch, feel (IPFV)’
       wai-       ‘wait for (PFV)’The verbs en- ‘pain’ and go- ‘like, appreciate’ are exceptional in that they do
not require object suffixes to be present in the verbal noun. For these two
verbs two forms exist, one with and one without object suffix. Thus, en- has
the verbal nouns (28) and (29):(28)   en-ye-m-in
       pain.IPFV-PL.AN.R-IPFV-VN
       ‘(event of) hurting us/you/them’(29)   en-in
       pain.IPFV-VN
       ‘(event of) hurting’The verb go- ‘like, appreciate’ has the verbal nouns (30) and (31):(30)   go-ˆb’-e-nam-in
       like-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-PFV-VN
       ‘(instance of) liking us/you/them’(31)   go-n-in
       like-AUX-VN
       ‘(event of) liking’.
344      9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseFor all other verbs in the list in (27) the object suffix is obligatorily part of the
verbal noun:(32)     fote-ˆb’-e-nam-in / *fote-nam-in
         rout-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-PFV-VN
         ‘(instance of) routing us/you/them’One perception verb and some verbs denoting physiological or psychological
states belong to the subclass of transitive verbs which obligatorily index their
object (i.e. the experiencer) with a suffix. Example (33) shows the use of the
perception verb mele-/men- ‘touch, feel’. Example (34) illustrates —/en- ‘hurt,
pain’:(33)     mele-ˆb’-a-s-o=a
         touch.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED         me-m-s-e=a

         head=SG.N1 hurt.IPFV-2SG.R-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=Q
         ‘Is your head hurting?’
9.2.4.     Transitives without object affixAlthough the transitive verbs of subclass 4 never cross-reference their object
they nonetheless have objects. For a more detailed treatment of this issue, see
3.14.2 on the grammatical relation of object in Mian.
   Compare (35) with an overt object noun phrase and (36) without one:(35)     imen=o          wen-b-i=be
         taro=N1.PL      eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am eating taro.’(36)     wen-b-i=be
         eat.IPFV-IPFV-1.SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am eating (it).’
                                                             9.2. Transitives   345The existence of these verbs shows that Mian is not fully head-marking at the
clause level. For these verbs, there is neither head-marking nor dependent-
marking.
    As with the other three types of transitive verb, the object noun phrase of
transitive verbs in the fourth subclass tends to be elided if referent identity is
recoverable from context or speech situation or if its identity is irrelevant. The
normal situation for any transitive verb is to occur without overt object noun
phrases in Mian discourse.
    Hence, transitives without cross-referencing object affixes might seem
difficult to separate from intransitive verbs in many instances. However, there
is both a syntactic and a semantic criterion which can be used to distinguish
the two from each other.
    Syntactically, transitives without cross-referencing object affixes differ
from intransitives in that they are always capable of having an overt object
noun phrase, which is still understood in case it is dropped. Intransitives can
under no circumstances have overt objects nor do they have elided but
understood objects.
    Semantically, the predications made by transitives without cross-
referencing object affixes can be characterized as involving a participant – in
addition to the participant encoded as subject – which undergoes or is affected
by (or effected/produced by) the action described by the verb. Even though
they might show up without an overt object noun phrase in discourse,
semantically they invariably describe two-place relations.
    An alternative analysis would be to treat transitives without cross-
referencing object affixes as ambitransitives, i.e. verbs which can be used
either transitively or intransitively without any overt derivation. Two types of
ambitransitives are normally distinguished in the literature. The decisive
question is “which of the transitive arguments corresponds to the intransitive
argument (Dixon 1994: 18). In the first type, intransitive S becomes transitive
A, as in ‘I am eating’ vs. ‘I am eating an apple’. In the second type,
intransitive S becomes transitive O, as in ‘the door opened’ vs. ‘I opened the
door’. Following Dixon (2002: 177), I will call these two types of
ambitransitives the “S=A type” and the “S=O type”.
    The alternation illustrated in (35) and (36) could thus be due to the fact that
the verb dowôn’/wen ‘eat’ is an S=A ambitransitive in Mian. However, I have
no evidence whatsoever suggesting (36) illustrates a change in argument
structure, in other words, that the verb becomes intransitive just because the
overt object noun phrase is elided. Therefore, I will reject the S=A
ambitransitive analysis here and recognize a fourth subclass of transitive verbs
whose objects are never indexed but can be freely elided without a change in
argument structure.
346    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause    Most transitive verbs which do not index their object occur with inanimate
objects only. Few can have animate objects, e.g. bina/— ‘shoot, pierce’, or
must have animate objects, e.g. bu ‘hunt’ and yo ‘initiate, beget’.
    Other transitive verbs of subclass 4 are: baa/o ‘say’, bafu ‘boil’, bali ‘to
bear (fruit)’, bina/— ‘shoot, pierce’, bu ‘hunt’, dabala/daba ‘make (arrow)’,
fa/faka ‘make (a fire)’, fu ‘cook, smoke’, fubâ ‘wash’, ga ‘cook in a leaf
oven’, ge/gen ‘build, roll, fasten’, gò’/gokà ‘cut (flesh, meat)’, haa ‘weave
(string bag)’, habù ‘obscure, hide’, hena/hen ‘seek’, kimâa’/— ‘look out for,
guard’, klâ ‘fix, complete’, klutâ/klutâ(ka) ‘smash’, maanafa/— ‘cut (cooked
meat)’, ngana/ngaan ‘sing’, nini ‘scrape (taro)’, ou ‘put (arrow head) into
shaft’, sita ‘care for’, ta ‘sharpen’, taye ‘crack open (nut)’, tosiana/tosian
‘fear’, wa ‘adorn with carvings’, went/wentê ‘hear, understand’, yo ‘initiate,
beget’.","[367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"

Appendix II
Mian-English wordlist
This Mian-English wordlist comprises approximately 1950 entries. It is based on my
own fieldwork and has been complemented with Smith and Weston (n.d.-b), which is
their dictionary of the Mian language. I have carefully checked the material from
Smith and Weston with one speaker and added tonal and grammatical information.
    An entry consists of underlying tone specification, word class, meaning, and
gender for nouns or stem aspect for verbs. Clitics and derivational suffixes are also
listed.
    If the lexical entry consists of two words the tonal specifications are given for each
one, separated by “/”. The tonal specification ‘LH(redup)’ means that the first part of
the word has low tone and that the reduplicant has high tone. ‘Toneless means that an
item is not lexically specified for tone.
    A noun marked as (PL) has plural as an inherent meaning. Any specification that is
doubtful at this stage is preceded by a question mark. Any specification that is
unknown has a question mark in its place.

8.5.5.1. The zero root ‘transfer’Mian has a perfective-only verb -Øˆ(-) with a very general meaning ‘transfer’,
which is interpreted as ‘take’ when it only indexes the object (with a
classificatory prefix) and as ‘give’ when both theme and recipient are indexed
(with a classificatory prefix and an object suffix, respectively). This verb is
interesting phonologically because it is segmentally zero, yet all word forms
based on this root have a LHL tonal melody (indicated by the diacritic ‘ˆ’ after
the zero stem). This suggests that there used to be a non-zero verb root
‘transfer’, which was elided, while the tone associated with it remained.
    The following examples illustrate -Øˆ ‘take (PFV)’ without a recipient
suffix (transitive), in (76), and -Øˆ- ‘give (PFV)’ with such a suffix
(ditransitive), in (77). Note that these suffixes are formally different from the
ûb- and ka-paradigms.

here. Recipients for all three verbs are always animate.
   The verb -Øˆ- ‘give (PFV)’ has an alternative series of recipient suffixes
which can be used with this verb only. These alternative recipient suffixes are
given in table 8.7. Grey areas indicate person and number combinations where
the gender contrast is neutralized.","[297, 298]"

6.3.5.    QuantifiersThe class of quantifiers comprises numerals and the quantifying expressions
homòn ‘many’, alukûm ‘all, every, each’, and alik ‘all, every, each’. Numerals
usually appear without an article. In Mian, pronouns from the ‘alone’-series
elekiêm (also eleyêm) ‘he/it alone’ and olokiêm (also oloyêm) ‘she/it alone’
double as the numeral ‘one’:(28)     naka=e      elekiêm
         man=SG.M    one.M
         ‘one man’ OR ‘the man alone’(29)     unáng=o      olokiêm
         woman=SG.F one.F
         ‘one woman’ OR ‘the woman alone’The only two basic numerals Mian has are asú ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’.
The former has a variant asusûna, which looks like a partial reduplication of
the simple numeral asú ’two’. Nonetheless, asusûna means ‘two’, not ‘four’:

       woman=PL.AN          two(=PL.AN)
       ‘two women’Numerals larger than three are phrasal and involve stringing together instances
of asú=ke ‘two=and’ (i.e. the numeral asú ‘two’ and the function verb stem ke
‘do’ serving as a coordinator in phrasal numerals) as many times as needed to
count to any even number and rounding this off by make ‘(one) other’ for odd
numbers. Phrasal numerals occur with the verbal element na ‘do’, if they carry
an article:(31)   unáng=i           asú=ke asú=ke
       woman=PL.AN two=do two=do
       ‘four women’ (lit. ‘two and two women’)(32)   memé         asú=ke asú=ke make             na=i
       children     two=do two=do other            do=PL.AN
       ‘five children’ (lit. ‘two and two children and another’)Numerals always occur after adjectival modifiers:(33)   memé          gwáab=i         asumâtna
       children      little=PL.AN    three
       ‘three little children’Instead of a numeral denoting an exact figure, the quantifier slot in the noun
phrase can be filled by homòn ‘many’:(34)   tíl=i         milil=i             sm=i         homòn=i
       dog=PL.AN black=PL.AN             big=PL.AN     many=PL.AN
       ‘many big black dogs’The quantifier alukûm ‘all, every, each’ usually follows the whole noun phrase
but can also precede it. The quantifier alik ‘all, every, each’ is only attested
following the noun phrase. The exact semantic difference between the two is
unclear.
    Neither alukûm nor alik can take an article or any other determiner:(35)   Mianam=o     naka=i          alukûm/alik        am-sa=be
       PN=N2        man=PL.AN       all/all            house-with=DECL
       ‘The men of Mianmin all have a house.’

This is illustrated for a simple demonstrative in (42) and (43), and for an
emphatic demonstrative in (44):(42)     naka     asumâtna    li

and a pronominal series. The former always involves the clitic element obba,
which is followed by the distal demonstrative.(45)     ninín=obba            y

internal. Both types of relative clause will be described in detail in section
13.3 under embedding.
    Prenominal relative clauses precede their head noun. They do not receive
any marking indicating subordination. An example of a prenominal relative
clause is given in (47):(47)     balubib=y        mâa’-bl-Ø-ib
         airstrip=at       stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ         naka=i
         man=PL.AN
         ‘the men who are standing at the airstrip.’Head-internal relative clauses are obligatorily marked with a proper subset of
determiners, all of which are also used to mark non-relativized noun phrases.
They function as noun phrases occupying the argument position which the
head noun has in the main clause, for example the object in (48):(48)     naka=i         balubib     y
         man=PL.AN      airstrip    at         mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i
         stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=PL.AN         ya-temê’-b-i=be
         PL.AN.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am looking at the men who are standing at the airstrip.’In head-internal relative clauses, the head noun can be omitted. The
restrictions concerning omission of the head noun are examined in more detail
in section 13.3.3. An example is:(49)     balubib y mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i
         airstrip at stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=PL.AN
         ‘the (ones) who are standing at the airstrip’In each of the examples above, the subject is relativized. Objects, possessors
and – at least in prenominal relative clauses – locatives can also be relativized.
216    6. The noun phrase    Constituent order in relative clauses is no different from the order in
independent clauses, with one noteworthy exception where the internal head
of a relative clause shows some mobility unattested in simple declarative
sentences (see 13.3.7). Verbs in relative clauses show all inflectional
possibilities of a (sentence-final) verb in an independent sentence in terms of
tense, aspect, mood, and argument marking. For example, they can be
inflected for irrealis or deontic mood, which medial verbs cannot.
    Head-internal relative clauses are much more frequent than prenominal
ones in natural discourse. Nearly all examples of prenominal relative clauses
are elicited. However, in most cases the prenominal variant of a head-internal
relative clause was offered immediately by the speaker without any further
question as to whether a prenominal relative construction was also possible.","[237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"

11.2.5.2. -bi ‘Imperfective auxiliary’ plus -Ø ‘DS.SIM’The only imperfective stems which can be serialized with -bi ‘Imperfective
auxiliary’ plus -Ø ‘DS.SIM’ in medial verb forms are X-stems, i.e. those which
always require an auxiliary to be inflected (see 8.4). These verbs cannot be
inflected directly by -b ‘DS.SIM’. There is no form *hâa’-b-i=a
[roam.IPFV-DS.SIM-1SG.SBJ=MED]. In order to express DS and event
simultaneity the auxiliary construction has to be used:(61)   hâa’-bi-Ø-o=ta                                      le

       ‘while she was roaming (the bush), this (one) took the child in his
       arms, and then…’ [Crows]It seems that some speakers treat -Ø ‘DS.SIM’ in an auxiliary serialization as a
more general marker of event simultaneity and allow the subject of the
reference clause to be either the same or different.
    Note that in this respect medial X-stems are similar to final X-stems. The
former cannot be directly inflected for -b ‘DS.SIM’ whereas the latter cannot be
directly inflected for -b ‘Imperfective’.
11.2.5.3. -biaan ‘Imperfective SS.SIM auxiliary’The only way to express simultaneity of events without a switch in subject
reference is to employ the auxiliary -biaan ‘IPFV.SS.SIM’ in the marked clause.
This auxiliary can only be used in the imperfective. The closest English
translation of such a verb would be ‘while V-ing’:

       ‘While cutting out the bowels of the rodents, she was cutting and
       eating bits of the intestines and while doing that she ...’ [Crows]The event in a reference clause following a marked clause with (-)biaan
(whether it occurs as a main verb or as an auxiliary) can be unbounded itself
or it can be bounded. In the former case, it must commence while the marked
clause event is on-going but can continue after the end of the marked clause
event. In the latter case, it must occur at some point in time while the marked
clause event is on-going, possibly terminating it. As with -b ‘DS.SIM’, the only
restriction on what temporal relation the events can have to each other is that
the reference clause event must not commence before the marked clause event
did.
    Medial verbs with the auxiliary -biaan followed by a subject suffix
sometimes appear in the shortened form biaam without a subject suffix
following. The form biaam also indicates imperfective, same subject and
simultaneity but does not express the subject. Two examples are provided

Notes
Notes to Chapter 1 1.   In the Mianmin creation myth, their female ancestor Dimosson created the first
      Mianmin couple after having come from the mythical place of Dimobib in the
      Highlands. Dimosson’s younger sister Fitibkanib created the first Telefol
      couple and later on gave birth to a white child, which she threw into the river,
      aghast at its pale skin colour. According to traditional Mianmin belief, all
      white people descended from this child.
 2.   Mian is an exception because its word for ‘river, water’ is aai. This word
      apparently has no cognates in the other Ok languages (Healey 1964b).
 3.   ‘Wagarabai’ is an Abau (Bailey 1975) name for a large river (which the
      Mianmin call ‘Kweima’) flowing into the August river. The lowland groups
      (quite a few of whom were in the Kweima valley at that time) were contacted
      from Green River, so the patrols would have had Abau-speaking interpreters,
      hence the use of Abau names. ‘Skonga’ (or sometimes ‘Suganga’), by contrast,
      is the Mian name for a smaller river upstream from Yapsiei (Don Gardner,
      pers. comm.).
 4.   Literally, these mean ‘bird language thinking’ and ‘white man language
      thinking’, respectively.
 5.   In older publications one finds the Dutch spelling ‘Iwoer’.
 6.   The inclusive pronoun nbo was probably formed by compounding n ‘we
      (EXCL)’ and bo ‘you (PL)’ to yield a relatively transparent first person plural
      inclusive pronoun.
 7.   Information on tone is not given.
 8.   There is another type of leaf oven found in New Guinea (e.g. in the Oksapmin
      area) for which the leaves are put into a shallow pit in the ground.","[604, 605]"

                            -sA few comments regarding this table are necessary here to orient the reader.
All suffixes will be dealt with in detail later in this section.
    The suffix -n in medial verbs has two functions. If the subject of the
marked clause is first person singular,1 it unequivocally indicates SS and event
sequentiality. In all other person-number combinations, -n functions as a more
general marker of event sequentiality and semantic coherence between clauses
and the subject of the subsequent clause can be the same or different.
    There is a notable exception to this rule. If a medial verb can only ever be
inflected with -n, this suffix invariably signals SS and SEQ in all person and
number combinations. This holds true for the six directionals if inflected
directly (see 9.1.2) and the verb -êb ‘take (in order to carry)’ and all forms
which contain -êb as an element, such as -silêb ‘follow’ (also see 8.6.4).
    For the sake of completeness, I included the auxiliary -biaan in table 11.5
above, which is used in auxiliary-serialized medial verbs to indicate SS and
event simultaneity. As it does not fall under direct inflection, it will be
discussed further below (11.2.5.3).
    The suffix -nab always indicates DS and event sequentiality, but also
signals that there is a short interval until the ensuing event commences.
    The suffix -s always indicates DS and event sequentiality. Additionally, -s
tends to be used when there is a tight temporal or even a causal relationship
between the events described by two adjacent clauses within a clause chain.
426    11. Chaining constructions11.2.3.1. Unusual behaviour of -n ‘(SS.)SEQ’There is an interesting typological quirk in the Mian S/R system. The suffix -n
‘(SS.)SEQ’ only unequivocally marks SS plus event sequentiality if the subject
of the marked clause is first person singular. The event described in the
marked clause temporally precedes the event in the reference clause and
events are sequentially performed by the same individual, as in (40):(40)   n        memâlo     fút=e

       I…’ [Rolling smokes]In a Reichenbachian model (Reichenbach 1947), the temporal structure of
events in (40) may be represented as follows (‘e1’ and ‘e2’ refer to the event
described in the marked and the reference clause, respectively; ‘<’ means
‘prior to’):(41)   e1 < e2      ——|——|———>
                      e1 e2If the subject of the marked clause is anything but first person singular the
subject of the reference clause can also be different, as in (42):(42)   te-n-ib=a                               mak=i         te

be a bounded event which is properly contained within e1 as in (43):(43)   ngaan-b-e=a                              naka=i

with respect to each other is that e2 must not commence before e1 did. In that
428    11. Chaining constructionssense, even a sequence of two medial clauses with simultaneous events is
iconic. Events can be temporally co-extensive but they do not have to be.
    In (45) above, there is a third event e3 which is bounded (namely the
opening of the stone gate in the third clause). This event e3 terminates e1 (i.e.
the blowing on the stone) but nothing is said about whether e2 is terminated as
well. The ‘watching’-event may continue after the stone gate has opened.
    Thus, the temporal structure of the events in (45) can be represented as
follows (I use the symbol ‘’ to indicate the endpoint of an unbounded event
as opposed to ‘|’ which indicates the occurrence of a bounded event):(46)   e1 O e 2   e1—————
       e2 O e3    e2—————|·····>
                         e3In the spontaneous corpus, -b ‘DS.SIM’ in the marked clause is indeed very
consistently followed by DS in the reference clause and speakers generally
judged clause chaining constructions with -b ‘DS.SIM’ in the marked clause
and a co-referent subject in the reference clause to be ungrammatical.
Contrary to speaker judgments, however, such cases are attested in the
spontaneous corpus (as long as the events described are simultaneous), for
example:(47)   e1   ke-ha-b-e=a

reference clause to have disjoint reference. The difference in their semantics is
hard to grasp. While -Ø ‘DS.SEQ’ only indicates DS and event sequentiality,
-s ‘DS.SEQ’ seems to specify that the event in the marked clause is a necessary
condition for the event in the reference clause to take place. This contrast
between -Ø and -s can be illustrated with example (49):(49)    e1   gíng=e            tob-tlâa’-n-i=a
             midrib=SG.N1      3SG.LONG.O-remove.PFV-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED        e2   tob-kimà-Ø-i=a

             ‘I remove the midrib (of the tobacco leaf), put it (the tobacco) in
             the fire, as it has dried, I break it (and then I …)’ [Rolling
             smokes]There are four events (e1 to e4), all of which occur sequentially. In the clauses
describing e1, e2, and e4, the subject is the narrator (first person singular). The
third clause (e3) has a different subject from the rest of this text chunk, namely
the tobacco, and it specifies a necessary condition for the event in the fourth
clause to take place, i.e. the tobacco having dried (e3) is a necessary
prerequisite for the speaker in (49) to break it (e4). In general, -s is used
instead of -Ø if the event in the marked clause is necessary for the one in the
reference clause to take place. Compare the following two examples (50) and
(51):(50)    kbo      te-s-eb=ta

        ‘When you come and we’ll work.’The occurrence of the -Ø DS marker is restricted by phonological context. In
final verbs, zero is a variant of -n ‘Realis’. Alternation is phonologically
conditioned by the subject suffix which always follows the aspect suffix. If the
subject suffix starts with /i/, as in the first person singular -i and the second
and third plural animate -ib, -n is commonly replaced by zero. In all other
cases, that is if the subject suffix starts with // as in the second singular -eb or
third singular masculine -e or with /o/ as in third singular feminine -o and first
plural -ob, zero alternation is possible (but far less common), provided that
omission of -n does not lead to a clash of like vowels. If zero alternation leads
to such a clash, -n has to surface in the pre-subject slot, e.g. baa-n-e=be ~
baa-Ø-e=be ‘he’s said’, ge-n-e=be ‘he’s built’, but *ge-Ø-e=be). Hence, there
are certain verb forms which simply cannot have zero in the pre-subject slot
by virtue of their phonological make-up. DS-zero in medial verbs is limited in
the same way. Certain verb forms cannot have the zero DS marker for
phonological reasons. Zero-marked medial verb forms like *ge-Ø-e=ta ‘he
built’ do not exist because of like-vowel clash. The only possible DS medial
form is ge-s-e=ta.
    There is a further phonological restriction for DS-zero, which is not as
obvious in final verbs as it is in medial verbs. Realization as zero is impossible
if the result means that two vowel-only syllables follow. As most final verbs
end in =be ‘DECL’, this situation does not arise often, but it does in questions:(52)    mukùng=e       goi-ˆs’-o-n-e=a? (*mukùng=e goi-ˆs’-o-Ø-e=a?)
        nose=SG.N1     smash.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
        ‘Has he smashed her nose?’This phonological restriction is much more relevant for medial verbs because
the standard medial clitic =a ‘and’ does not start with a consonant. Medial
verb forms like *mukùng=e goi-ˆs’-o-Ø-e=a ‘he’s smashed her nose and then
she …’ are ruled out. If the medial clitic =ta is used, which starts in a
consonant, zero can alternate freely with -s to indicate sequentiality and DS in
medial verbs. The form goi-ˆs’-o-Ø-e=ta is correct.
   Three important and highly frequent verbs have alternative “zero-
compatible” stems which all end in a consonant /l/ to avoid like-vowel clash,
e.g. te ~ tl ‘come (PFV)’, bi ~ bl ‘exist, stay (IPFV)’, and ge ~ gl ‘say (PFV)’.

verb stems already inflected with -m ‘Inchoative imperfective’ (see 8.6.1.6).
Such a form focuses on the inception of an action or event. In this case, -s
indicates that a change of subjects will take place in the reference clause even
though the situation described by the verb in the marked clause might still
hold when the event of the reference clause comes into effect, as in (53):(53)   e1   mele-ˆb’-a-s-o=a

            ‘as it (a wallaby) touched him (a baby), he started to cry,
            so it ran away and then …’ [Afoksitgabáam]The temporal structure of the events in this example can be represented as
follows. Note that event e2 refers to the inception of the ‘crying’, as expressed
by the inchoative form me-m:(54)   e1 > e2 > e3   ——|—|——————>
                        e1 e2 —|——>
                               e3There are no medial verbs which only bear the inchoative aspect suffix -m.
The sequence -m plus -s is possible in medial verbs only.
11.2.3.5. -nab ‘DS.SEQ.SHORT INTERVAL’The marker -nab in medial verbs indicates DS and sequentiality and also a
short interval between events:(55)   aaleb=e          abuko     y

          ‘later they left the father there and after a short while he jumped
