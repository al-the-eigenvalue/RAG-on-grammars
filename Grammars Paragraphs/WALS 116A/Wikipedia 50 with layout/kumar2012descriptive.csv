"5.4.14 Question particle
Jarawa employs the question particle in yes/no questions. However, this questionparticle also has (limited) use in content questions (wh-questions). The examples(5.40) and (5.41) demonstrate the use of the question particle in yes/no questionsof verbless clauses while examples (5.42) and (5.43) show the use in yes/noquestions of verbal clauses.

4.7.1   Yes/no questions
The schema of a yes/no question is presented in (4.81).

"
In interrogatives, we looked at yes/no questions and wh-questions, which differsyntactically. Yes/no questions are formed by placing the interrogative marker kaat the beginning of a clause, while in wh-questions the wh-word occupied its situposition. The use of the interrogative marker with some wh-questions was alsofound.",[247]
"4.7 Interrogative clauses
Interrogatives in Jarawa are of two types: ‘yes/no’ questions and wh-questions.",[188]
"
4.5.3   Use of ɲag
For short responses or an answer to a yes/no question, Jarawa uses the negativeparticle ɲag at the beginning of the negative response, followed by the negatedsentence. For instance, the negative response to the yes/no question given in(4.70) would be (4.71).
        (4.70) ka     ŋa-kaja            pečame               INTM   2POSS-mother       die               Has your mother died?        (4.71) ɲag    ma-kaja           pečame naɖem               No     1POSS-mother      die       NEG               No, my/our mother has not died.",[185]
"However, the use of the question particle in content questions is limited. Mostlycontent questions are formed with the question word in situ. The examples (5.46–5.48) illustrate the usual way of forming content questions, where questionwords are employed without the question particle.",[234]
"
                                                                                    79

This raises the question as to whether the hypothesis that “mi” forms are subjectsand “ma” forms are objects is valid. It is also difficult to say whether it is anidiolectal variation. In the present study there is no answer to this issue.","[97, 98]"
"
Yes/no questions may also be formed out of verbless clauses by using theinterrogative marker ka as shown in (4.85), followed by some examples.

    (4.86)   ka     ŋi əŋ ?",[189]
"There is one example in the corpus which shows that the question particle maybe used in between the noun phrase and the question word. In example (5.49)cajwaj ‘name of a girl’ is a noun phrase and ʈʰucəʈəgə ‘where’ is a question word,and question particle comes in between the two. The example given in (5.49) canbe articulated without question particle as given in (5.50). It is surprising thathere the question particle cannot be used in the beginning of the sentence; theuse of question particle at the beginning of the clause in (5.51) makes thesentence ungrammatical.

"As mentioned, the question particle may also be used in content questions. Theexamples (5.44) and (5.45) show this.
      (5.44) ka-ŋi         kahiunen   onəhə     ɖi     h-ija-g?",[234]
"
Some constructions involve the structure SUB + INTM + question word. Theseconstructions mostly contain the subject NP and the question word for ‘where’.",[193]
"
In (3.120a) there is a question and we get the response as in (3.120b). However, itis not essential to get the question like (3.120a) everytime, and hence the meaningof the sentence can be derived from the context in which the conversation iscarried out.",[154]
"
4.7.2   Wh-question
In wh-questions in Jarawa, some NPs in the clause are replaced correspondingquestion words (interrogative pronouns/adverbs). The wh-words stay in situ, i.e.the question word used for the subject NP would stay in canonical subjectposition and the question word used for the object NP would stay in canonicalobject position. Other question words (interrogative adverbs like when andwhere) also appear in canonical positions. Interrogative sentences with wh-words explored below.
1. onne ‘who’
The question word onne ‘who’ is used for humans. It can be employed for the Sargument of an intransitive verb, the A argument of a transitive verb, and anindirect object (including benefactors).
      (4.90)   onne   ɖi        olleg-ɖə          bəᵼʈʰe?               who    REF       Olleg-LOC         go               Who went to Olleg/Lakaralunda?",[190]
"Pronominals can also be attached to the Interrogative Marker (INTM) ka. kagenerally occurs at the beginning of a yes/no question. In this construction, thepronominal, used as the S(ubject)/A(gent) argument of the clause, is suffixed tothe interrogative marker. Consider example (3.20).
           (3.20)    ka-ŋi         kekahəʈə     olleg        ɖə    bəᵼʈʰe                     INTM-2        tomorrow     Olleg        LOC   go                     Will you go to Olleg tomorrow?",[102]
"In first type, the interrogative marker ka is used at the beginning of the sentence,while in the second type question words (interrogative pronouns) are used tocreate the interrogative. However, there are some instances where theinterrogative marker is used even in wh-questions. All these structures aredescribed in the following sub-sections.",[188]
"Another question word onəhəle ‘what-VS’ seems to be derived from onəhə ‘what’. Ipropose this due to the {-le} suffix, which is generally employed with nouns todenominalise them (for detailed discussion, see § 3.9.2). Onəhəle may, here, mean‘what are (you) doing?’ or ‘why are (you) doing?’ Other question words likekahaje ‘where’, ʈʰučəgə ‘where’, nojčʰe ‘how many’ may have some differencessince these words are used with Interrogative Marker (INTM).",[104]
"Interrogative dependent clauses have the same syntactic structure as simple wh-question clauses. Thus the schema of such clause external complement clause ispresented in (4.119), and (4.120) illustrates it.",[201]

"
In (4.107) there are clearly two clauses with two verbs, each verb takes evidentialmarker. In (4.109) only the main verb takes evidential marker. They also seem tobe embeded within one another. If they are two clauses embeded within oneanother, we need to answer the question raised in (4.110). As we will notice againin section 4.9, ɖi is a marker of definiteness/referentiality and it also specifiesgrammatical relations. This morpheme is generally used with nominalsfunctioning as either S argument or O argument. It is also used with the nominalwhich is IO of the clause. Since this morpheme is definiteness marker, we cannot                                                                                   179

There are some cases where the interrogative marker ka is employed in this typeof wh-question, as shown in (4.100). It was not ascertained why ka appears insuch cases. The ordering of the interrogative marker and other constituents of theclause is as we have in other interrogative constructions, where we haveinterrogative marker in the beginning of the clause followed by otherconstituents.

The chapter is organized in the following manner. In section 4.1, I present a briefintroduction to Jarawa clause structure. Section 4.2 discusses the verbless clausein which a nominal or an adjective may play the role of a predicate. In section 4.3is a detailed discussion of the verbal clause with core argument. Section 4.4discusses verbal clauses with peripheral arguments. Section 4.5 focuses on thenegative construction, and section 4.6 describes imperative structures (includescommands, requests, and prohibition). Section 4.7 concentrates on howinterrogative constructions are formed: it further focuses on yes/no and wh-question types. In section 4.8, complex sentences are discussed, and a closeexamination of direct speech is presented. Section 4.9 attempts to depict thefunction of definiteness/referential morpheme {ɖi} which seems to be used in theergative-absolutive system. Section 4.10 presents the conclusion of the chapter.",[161]

4.0 Introduction
The preceding chapter was a detailed study of Jarawa morphology. The presentchapter attempts to describe the syntactic structure of Jarawa: syntactic strategies(how the language conveys commands, requests; the formation of questions, theuse of Reported Speech, and so on) and clause structure. The chapter willelaborate these structures and their variances.","[160, 161]"

Sentence (3.113) demonstrates the use of {ɲačʰe}. Note that in (3.113) the secondperson pronoun which is the S argument of the clause is dropped. (3.114) is theresponse for the question asked in (3.113). I have used the term comitative (COM)for this postposition.

"But the use of ɖi in sentence (4.148) raises a question about the criteria employedto consider an NP to be definite. In this sentence, ɖəwaɖəwa ‘biscuits’ is neitherseen nor not does it refer to a definite packet of biscuits. It may be the case thatthe reference here is to a specific kind of packets of biscuits which the researcher(myself) generally used to bring during fieldwork.

In Jarawa, clause internal clauses have the structure of a normal clause. Theydenote a proposition. In the case of (4.107) it denotes an action. They alsodemonstrate the syntactic properties of O (for detailed discussion see section 4.9),it is, however, misleading to say that ujijə ɖ-ipale-jə functions as the O of bəᵼʈʰe,since bəᵼʈʰe is an intransitive verb and it cannot take an O argument. I, still,submit that such clauses are possibly made of two clauses: one is the main clauseand the other is the clause internal complement clause. This is based on the
180
                                                                                 181
assumption that these clause internal complement clauses are peripheralarguments of the clause in case of (4.107). It is still an open question whether theyare complement clauses or not.","[198, 199]"
Based on these facts we may infer that ɖi is used for the clause [ujijə]NP [ɖ-ipale-yə]]VP treating it as an NP. Is it a plausible answer? It is still open for furtherresearch. The second problem poses a grave problem. Since bəᵼʈʰe is anintransitve verb it cannot take an object NP. Dixon (2010) proposed three criteriato identify a complement clause which is reproduced in (4.111).,[198]

     Plosives Group C.           In this group there is only one pair of sounds. In this     pair we have palatal plosives. However, the corpus lacks minimal pairs to

                                                                                      53
     confirm that they are phonemes. A lot of interchangeability has been     observed in this pair, but this is not true of all the words where one or the     other occurs. If we take pattern congruity as the principle to establish the     phonemic status of this pair of the sounds, we may claim that these sounds     are phonemes in this language.
/č/ vs. /ǰ/
The phoneme /č/ is a voiceless unaspirated palatal plosive while /ǰ/ is a voiced,unaspirated palatal plosive. Their existence as distinct phonemes has not beenestablished. The data so far demonstrates that they are in free variation in thislanguage, and no minimal pairs exist on record to claim that they are distinctphonemes. We have seen above in the case of bilabial sounds /p/ and /b/ thatthough they can sometimes be substituted for one another, they are still distinctphonemes, since minimal pairs for them have been found. The same is the casewith the sounds /k/ and /g/. In the case of /č/ vs. /ǰ/, there are words like /čə:w/‘wild potato’ which may be pronounced as /ǰə:w/. But also attested are words like/čawa:ja/ ‘walk[v]’ which is never articulated as /ǰawa:ja/. There are, in fact, a lot ofwords that begin with /č/ which cannot be replaced by /ǰ/. This creates thesuspicion that these sounds could be considered as distinct sounds in thislanguage. However, the question is still open as to whether /č/ and /ǰ/ are distinctphonemes in this language or they are allophonic variants of the same phone.

2.2.2.2    Nasals
Jarawa uses voiced nasals. It employs four places of articulation for the nasals,bilabial, dental, palatal, and velar. Thus, we have four nasals in this language,/m, n, ɲ, ŋ/. They seem to be in contrast with each other. However, the minimalpairs for these nasals are not straightforward. Rather, I will demonstrate herethat contrasts exist between the following pairs: /m/ and /n/, /m/ and /ɲ/, /n/ and/ɲ/, and /n/ and /ŋ/. However, minimal pairs have not been found for the pair /ɲ/and /ŋ/.
/m/ vs. /n/
The phoneme /m/ is a voiced bilabial nasal while /n/ is a voiced dental nasal.","[70, 71, 72]"

2.5      Syllabification
Jarawa attests all the four variants of minimal possible syllable structures, but thepresent corpus suggests that only one consonant is allowed in onset and codapositions. If a word is composed of more than one syllable, the parsing of thesyllable would be as shown in (2.81).","[83, 84]"

Words in Jarawa may be monosyllabic, disyllabic, or polysyllabic entities. Thesecombinations are explained with reference to the occurrences of vowels in thebeginning of words, or medially or finally. I consider here words which end witha consonant (closed syllable) or without a consonant (open syllable). Let usconsider the following words:

2.7     Morphophonemics
In this section I will discuss the phonological changes which occur in thislanguage. There are two kinds of phonological processes which will be discussedhere. Section 2.7.1 focuses on two forms of pronominals, which I have termed the‘mi form’ and the ‘ma form’, conditioned according to how they are used. Section2.7.2 presents a complex phenomenon which Jarawa exhibits, wherein two wordsare taken together and the form of the second word is reduced. For example, mi‘1GEN’ and paʈʰo ‘arrow’ are taken together and pronounced as /maʈʰo/ ‘my arrow’.","[84, 85, 86, 87]"
"4.6.2   Prohibitive clauses
Prohibitives are a kind of command, order, or advice to not to do something. InJarawa, these are formed by putting the negative element naɖem after the verb,like it happens in simple negative sentences.

2.2.1.2    Quantitative Contrasts
Whether quantitative contrast appears across the board in this language is notclear because not all the quantitative contrasts have minimal pairs. However,there is evidence of some minimal pairs, which indicate there is quantitativedifference in this language. The data presented here covers both types of cases. Ihave divided the examples into two groups; one which has minimal pairs andanother which does not.","[59, 60, 61, 62]"

3.    Negative particle: It is also used with the negative particle naɖem ‘not’. {ʈʰi}is employed with negative particle when the negative particle is used for a shortresponse of a sentence or clause. This is illustrated by the example (3.120a and3.120b).

"Throughout the dissertation I have taken /mi/, /ŋi/, and /hi/ form as ‘mi form’ and/ma/, /ŋa/, and /hiwa/ or /wa/ as ‘ma form’. However, there is a great difference inthe usage of the mi form and the ma form in the syntax, especially in possessive                                                                                   69

constructions (for detailed discussion, see § 3.3.1). In the present chapter, Ienquire into whether there is any phonological reason to use mi vs. ma forms,particularly in possessive constructions. In these constructions, for first andsecond person any either form may be used, but only /wa/ is permitted for thirdperson. The examples in table 2.6 illustrate some of the patterns of usage of miand ma forms.","[87, 88]"

2.2.1.1     Qualitative Contrasts
Qualitatively, vowels in Jarawa consist of high, mid, and low vowels in front,central, and back positions with rounding and non-rounding features. This three-way combination of articulation yields seven vowels. These vowels are /i, e, u, o,a, ə, ᵼ/. The phonemic status of /ᵼ/ has been established in this language but it isstill difficult to provide acoustic evidence to claim that the phoneme /ᵼ/ is a high-mid central unrounded vowel. At the auditory level, this phoneme seems to be alittle bit higher than the mid central unrounded vowel /ə/ but lower than thehigh central unrounded vowel /ᵼ/. Moreover, two mid-low vowels have beenencountered, but their phonemic status is not clear. Their occurrences are alsolimited in the data and I do not have any minimal pairs at present. I will presenttheir distribution in phonological structure in section 2.1.2. Below I present someminimal pairs and near-minimal pairs to establish the phonemic status ofvowels.
/i/ vs. /e/
The close high front unrounded vowel /i/ stands in contrast with the half closemid front unrounded vowel /e/.

"
It has been observed that these pronominals are prefixed to verbs, nouns, oradjectives which begin with a vowel. In such cases the forms that are prefixed arephonologically similar shortened forms of the independent forms. Theindependent forms and their prefixed forms are given in table 3.3.",[98]
"
The superlative degree is formed by combining the adjective with an adverb, orby using a new word which is not morphologically similar to the positive form ofa descriptive adjective. In (3.103), there is an adverb ʈʰuhumə ‘very’ which is usedto indicate superlative degree.
          (3.103) kopel-wa-a:w                ʈʰi       huʈʰu     ʈʰuhumə                    Kopel-POSS-bow            COP       big       very                    Kopel’s bow is the biggest one.",[145]
"
In the adjective category, this language was observed to demonstrate descriptiveadjectives, numerals, and demonstratives. Descriptive adjectives consist of wordsrelated to colour terms or which define, describe, and qualify nouns. Also foundwas marking of the degree of adjectives. In degrees of comparison positive,comparative, and superlative degrees are attested. The positive degree is formedby the noun phrase and adjective. The comparative degree was seen to beexpressed syntactically. In the comparative degree, the standard of comparisonwas observed to precede the marker of comparison, and the adjective to followthe marker of comparison. Superlative degree was seen as formed by employingthe intensifier or a completely new word which was not found to have anyresemblance with the adjective of positive degree.",[243]
"In the case of possessive constructions, both the forms are possible. Within thescope of this study, it can only be said that the distinction between “mi” and“ma” forms seems to be phonological to some extent, though not always (fordetailed discussion, see § 2.5.1).",[98]
"4.5 Negative clauses
Negation in Jarawa can be expressed in two ways: either by using theindependent negative word naɖem or the suffix –ma. Both are used for clausalnegation. There is no semantic difference between the two, but the suffix –ma hasrestricted use in the language while naɖem can be used across the board.",[181]
"
The chapter is organized in the following manner. Section 2.1 focuses on theproblems of sounds and phonemes in this language and the criteria that havebeen employed to claim the phonemic status of a sound. It also talks aboutphonemic contrasts of sounds, where I provide minimal pairs. I go on to describethe phonemic distribution of sounds in syllables and words. Then I provide theoccurrences of sounds in different environments. In section 2.2 the syllablestructure of Jarawa is discussed. Section 2.3 describes syllabification, and section2.4 deals with word structure. Section 2.5 focuses on the morphophonemics ofJarawa phonology. A brief conclusion of the chapter is presented in section 2.6.",[54]
"5.4.13 Negation
Jarawa employs two strategies to express negation: either putting a negativeword at the end of a clause, or using a negative suffix to the verbs. Though thenegative word can be used in any type of clause, whether verbal or verbless, thenegative suffix is used only in verbal clauses. Examples in (5.33–5.38) illustrate                                                                              213

"These examples show “mi” forms in the subject position and “ma” forms in theobject position of the clause. However, examples like (3.10) show that mi formsmay also be used in the object position of a clause.
