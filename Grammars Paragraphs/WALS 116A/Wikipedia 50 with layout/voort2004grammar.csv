5.5.19.3. Modal interpretations of -tara-So far, the morpheme -tara- was considered as a kind of procrastinative aspect
suffix. However, there are some constructions which may lead to a more modal
interpretation of -tara-.
    When followed by -hͿ, and then verbalised by declarative -ki, the element
-tara- has the sense of ‘to do certainly’. This meaning may be only distantly
related to ‘to do later’ or ‘to do first’:(2256)   atsu'ka nãi-ta-'tara-hͿ-ki
         sugar     like-1O-PROC-NOM-DEC
         ‘(I’m definitely) certain it is sugar (which made me ill)’(2257)   e'tay     nãi-ta-'tara-hͿ-ki
         woman like-1O-PROC-NOM-DEC
         ‘(I’m definitely) certain it is the women (who are calling me)’ (t)Note that -tara- occupies the expected position after object marking. In the pre-
sent construction -tara- may also be applied directly to a noun, which has ap-
parently undergone zero-verbalisation:(2258)   atsu'ka-'tara-hͿ-ki
         sugar-PROC-NOM-DEC
         ‘(I’m definitely) certain it is sugar (and not salt)’  When followed by -hͿ, and then verbalised by cosubordinative -ta, the ele-
ment -tara- has the sense of ‘to have done already’. This meaning seems easily

about how to make chicha, the indigenous beverage. It contains two instances
of -tara-hͿ-ta:(2259)   kayte-'ce-a-ta             'be    ja
         scrape-CL:hole-1P-CSO      leaf   alreadytowİ=txi'te-a-tara-hͿ-ta    kayte-'ce-a-ta                     'hãrã-a-ta

   already broken off and piled up, and we finished cleaning. After having put
   the maize on the fire and cooked it, finishing to clean, now they (the men)
   used to dig, and plant (the mortar)’In the following example, -tara- modifies a habitual construction (see 8.6.1.):(2260)   e'xwa-tjate 'mİ̘-tjarjͿ-dy-ta a-tara-'hͿ-ta
         man-3.POS beat-much-DS-CSO exist-PROC-NOM-CSO         ‘mİ̘-e-dy-ta        emã=hã'rã-tja

         ‘she was already accustomed to her husband always hitting her, when
         he beat again, she just stopped crying’ (t)In the next example, -tara-hͿ-ta is part of a reported speech construction (see
5.5.11.):(2261)   kui-xa-'ki=cwa-tara-hͿ-ta
         drink-2-DEC=IS-PROC-NOM-CSO
         ‘(I did not offer as) they said that you had already drunk’    The construction represented by the subsequent examples is formally identi-
cal to (2259), but it has a different, more modal sense of ‘to do fortunately’:(2262)   'tͅitja    'a-tara-hͿ-ta
         alone      exist-PROC-NOM-CSO
         ‘luckily, he was (there) alone’

            alone      exist-1S-PROC-NOM-CSO
            ‘luckily, I was alone’
5.5.19.3.1. -tjara- as an alternative of -tara-There is a modal construction with the same semantic value of -tara- ‘fortu-
nately’ as in examples (2262) and (2263), but it involves an alternative element
-tjara-. This may force us to look at the element -tara- in a different way. Note
the following examples:(2264)      tei-'hͿ-tjara-hͿ-ta           (*tͅihͿtarahͿta)
            one-NOM-PROC-NOM-CSO
            ‘luckily there being (only) one’259(2265)      aky-'hͿ-tjara-hͿ-ta

            ‘luckily there being (only) two’(2266)      hakai-tjate-'le-tjara-hͿ-ta
            grandparent-3.POS-only-PROC-NOM-CSO
            ‘how lucky he was that only his grandmother was there’ (t)The following construction is obviously related:(2267)      txa'nã awe-'he-tjara-re (2268)              txa'nã kui-'he-tjara-re
            we.IN    rain-NEG-PROC-INT                  we.IN    drink-NEG-PROC-INT
            ‘good that it did not rain!’                ‘good that he didn’t drink (it)!’This construction represents a partially idiomatic expression, in which the in-
clusive pronoun (see 4.7.2.) and the interrogative mood are used emphatically
(see 5.2.2.1.). Also constructions which are somehow the negative equivalents
of (2252) and (2253) seem to require -tjara- instead of -tara-:259.Note that example (2264) represents a corrected version of the following:            ?*tei-'hͿ-tja-tara-hͿ-ta
            one-NOM-CSO-PROC-NOM-CSO
            ‘luckily there was (only) one’      Even though the verb in this example bears canonical -tara- it is in a strange posi-
      tion, as it follows a clause-final cosubordination marker. This is probably why it was
      rejected later by the consultant.
                                                5.5. Tense, modality and aspect    443(2269)    atsile-'he-tjara-re          (*'atsiletjara're)
          heavy-NEG-PROC-INT
          ‘it isn’t very heavy is it?’(2270)    dehe-'he-tjara-re
          bitter-NEG-PROC-INT
          ‘it isn’t very bitter, is it?’In a way -tjara- in the latter two examples can also be interpreted as semanti-
cally related to ‘fortunately’. It so happens both questions anticipate a reassur-
ing answer. Example (2269) was uttered in the context of someone wanting the
speaker to carry something, but the speaker was in doubt, because the item to
be carried looked rather heavy. Example (2270) was uttered in the context of
someone wanting the speaker to drink medicine. Especially children abhor bit-
ter tastes. Note that the said positive equivalents (2252) and (2253) also have a
modal connotation of ‘fortunately’. Here is one more, elliptic, example:(2271)    'he-tjara-ki
          NEG-PROC-DEC
          ‘it isn’t dirty!’, ‘don’t worry!’, ‘nothing wrong!’, ‘doesn’t matter!’    Instead of the expected -tara-, we find -tjara- in the examples of the present
section. This strongly reminds of the variation between cosubordinative -ta and
-tja as discussed in (8.3.1.4.). This is corroborated by the fact that -tjara- is in-
compatible with non-third person forms. Compare the following example to
(2268):(2272)    txa'nã kui-'he-da-tara-re
          we.IN    drink-NEG-1S-PROC-INT
          ‘good that I did not drink (it)!’ (it was poisoned)So, one could ask whether -tara- is actually discontinuous. Would it not be
better to analyse it as a clause-final cosubordinative -ta, which is then followed
by an unidentified verb ra- of modal content? And, would this have conse-
quences for the analysis of all examples in the present section (5.5.19.)? Under
such an analysis, e.g. (2214) should be analysed as a biclausal construction:(2273)    'ja-da-ta      'ra-tse
          eat-1S-CSO ???-DEC
          ‘I’ll eat later’The fact that ra- bears stress here could be used in support of its interpretation
as a verbal root. However, there are very many instances of ra- without stress,
to begin with (2215). Furthermore, -tara- can be omitted, together with the
sense of ‘to do later’, as if it were an indivisible suffix:
444   5. The verb phrase(2274)   o'kja-a-'xa-(tara)-tsy-hͿ-he're=jã-re          (see 8.1.1.3.)
         hunt-1P-AS-PROC-POT-NOM-APPL=be-INT
         ‘we are still going to hunt! (but we’re too busy now)’Finally, no clearly identifiable verb root of the form ra- was attested. One
could assume the existence of such a root, by analysing ra- as ‘to be’ or ‘to be-
come’. With some imagination, rahͿki in example (2256) can be ascribed the
sense of ‘to be certainly’, ratsytse in (2220) ‘to be potentially’, ramͿ in (2245)
‘I to be’ and so on. But then one would also expect elliptic occurrences of this
construction, in which a context like e.g. the question ‘when are you going to
eat?’ allows for a minimal answer, such as ratse ‘it will be’. However, such el-
liptic answers always include the preceding person marker and -ta-, as in
(2223).
    There is actually one verb root of the form ra-. It is apparently based on the
imperative mood morpheme -ra. It occurs only in combination with a subse-
quent transitiviser -tja- and means ‘to order (him)’:(2275)   ra'tja-ki                 (2276)     İ-'nƭ-da-ta ra'tja-da-ki
         order-DEC                            go-CAUS-1S-CSO order-1S-DEC
         ‘he ordered him’, ‘he’s insisting’   ‘I ordered him to go home’Another form based on imperative -ra is elliptic, and contains a preceding em-
phatic imperative morpheme -ca- (which is also pronounced as [tja]). It func-
tions as a positive minimal answer to an offer or a declaration of intention:(2277)   ca-'ra
         EMP-IMP
         ‘yes! / it is O.K. / do so!’I assume that these imperative constructions have nothing to do with any analy-
sis of the procrastinative -t(j)ara-. They are discussed further in (5.5.11.1.).","[478, 479, 480, 481, 482]"

2.10. IntonationIntonation contours may have an illocutionary function in Kwaza. Actually
verbal moods such as declarative, interrogative, imperative etc. require a for-
mal expression and are often accompanied by a specific intonation. From a
formal point of view, verbs without morphological person and mood marking
are incomplete. In the proper context, however, such marking can be omitted. It
appears that in such cases, the accompanying intonation pattern becomes more
prominent as if to make up for the omitted morphemes.
   In the interrogative mood, tone rises at the end of the utterance, and more
distinctly so, in the case of ellipsis of person and interrogative markers (and it
sometimes also influences the placement of stress). It is symbolised here by an
upw ard arrow <n> preceding the syllable with rising pitch:     ['wa!a'sasa'4e]               ‘have you finished?’
     ['wa!a'nsa]                   ‘have you finished?’     [ku'kuKnãƭ!enÓ'4jasa4e]      ‘did you suffer pain?’
     [ku'kuKnãƭ!enÓ'n4ja]         ‘you suffered pain?’     ['sÓKÈÓ'4jѸÓ'4e]              ‘is it your place?’
     ['sÓKÈÓ'n4jѸÓ]                ‘your place?’     [ha'tsi!Ǌ]                     ‘heliconia flower’
     [ha'tsi!Ǌ'4e]                  ‘is it a heliconia flower?’
     [hatsi'n!Ǌ]                    ‘(you mean/is it) heliconia flower?’     [ha'hanÓmãƭ'nãdaki]           ‘I’m going to brush my teeth’
     [ha'hanÓmãƭ'nnã]              ‘are you going to brush your teeth?’   When information is provided without the use of the declarative morpheme,
intonation (and stress placement) differs from the ordinary. The following pro-
nunciation of the word [ln'nİ] ‘hole’ was heard as an answer to the question
'what do you call the hole (i.e. mouth) of the basket?’:     ['lnnİ]                        ‘just “hole”’   As we saw in section (2.8.) above, the negative morpheme /-he-/ usually
gets main stress. In short context-dependent replies it also gets a high tone.
                                         2.12. Loan phonology and phonetics    75Note that in the following example of a question and the answer to it, the verb
stem is omitted:   [ÈÓ'nwa]                       ‘have you finished cutting (rice)?’
   [""nheÈanÓ hakn'4e ÈÓ'wa]       ‘not yet, tomorrow we will finish to cut’   Maybe because of their semantic content, some words always get high pitch
and heavy stress on the first syllable:   [""ntsi!a4jѸÓki]                 ‘it is (completely) silent’
2.11. Exceptional soundsIt is a known fact that ideophones often contain sounds which may in principle
be considered as phonemes but which otherwise do not occur in the language’s
ordinary vocabulary. The same goes for specific sounds in loanwords, and may
hold for specific registers too./ng/ [0] is encountered in the ideophone [tu'pǊ0] ‘splash!’. It is probably a (ve-
lar) continuation of the nasal feature of the preceding [Ǌ]./ü/ [y] is encountered in the ideophone [hy:'4yp]. This ideophone symbolises
the chant of the iriwa bird species. Note that /ü/ is also a loan phoneme from
Aikanã, and that a similar ideophone is probably the basis of the name for the
iriwa bird in Aikanã: hü'rüdü'dü.","[112, 113]"

5.2.1.2. Semantic characteristics of -tse vs. -kiAside from morpho(phono)logically determined conditions on the occurrence
of either declarative marker, there are also semantic factors involved. For a
number of verbs, when zero-marked for person (i.e. definite third person), there
seems to be no semantic difference whatsoever between the applications of -ki
and -tse. I have listed the roots of a number of these verbs below:(1275) bõ'rõ-     ‘perforate’                 kwİ-        ‘enter’
       bwa-       ‘finish’                    ori-        ‘to be climbing’
       eroke'ja- ‘bifurcate’                  takai'sa- ‘traverse, divide’
       İsiko'je- ‘hold by the hand’           tyi-        ‘fill river’
       İsitso'ro- ‘hold by the wrist’         tu'rwe-     ‘heal’
       jana'nãi- ‘fine’                       tsi'tsi-    ‘burnt, is burning’
       Ϳ'mͿ-      ‘entwine, sleep with’       wacerjͿ'he- ‘be overgrown’
       kãu-       ‘break, tear’               watxita'hͿ- ‘guard’
       ki'ke-     ‘hot’                       we-         ‘be afraid’
       ki'tsİ-    ‘(tell) lie’                wİ-         ‘bring, carry’
       ko'rjͿ- ‘be absent’                    wy-         ‘tempest, rustle, buzz’
       kõrõ'rõ- ‘snore’
174.Unfortunately, the semantic distinction between these two examples cannot be
    shown because they were elicited without a relevant context.
288    5. The verb phraseFrom a formal point of view, this is quite a motley collection. The list includes
both transitive and intransitive verbs from various different semantic
“classes”.175 Two items from this list were illustrated above by examples
(1262) and (1263). The following contrast shows that valency differences do
not determine the alternation between -ki and -tse:(1276)    amǊ'tay 'kãu-ki                /   amǊ'tay 'kãu-tse
          glass      break-DEC           /   glass   break-DEC
          ‘the bottle broke’The intransitive verb kãu- ‘break’ can only be made transitive through such
means as composition with the transitive verb stem asa- ‘leave, end, destroy’.
    For another set of verbs there seems to be a relative difference in comple-
tivity or perfectivity beteen the two declarative morphemes:(1277) ba-            ‘cut, clear’                 le'ja-        ‘be ahead’
       birjete-       ‘undo, take apart’           nͿ'mǊ-        ‘(water) be high’
       du-            ‘close / finish all’         o'nİ-         ‘arrive’
       he'bo-         ‘be blind’                   xu'ru-        ‘soften’
       hedu'tu-       ‘lose’                       tu'ru-        ‘wake up’
       i'si-          ‘die, be drunk’              tsa'si-       ‘follow’
       ja-            ‘eat’                        tsei-         ‘start, commence’
       ki-            ‘be ripe, red’               tsitİ'kja-    ‘erect’
       ke'hͿ-         ‘burn up’                    Ǌ-            ‘be, stand, sit’When the -ki declarative is applied to the root of one of these verbs, the result
tends to be in general less “perfective” than when the -tse declarative is ap-
plied:(1278)    ja 'baki            ‘he is already clearing the field’
          ja 'batse           ‘he has already cleared the field’(1279)    birje'teki          ‘he is undoing the house’
          birje'tetse         ‘he undid the house’(1280)    'duki               ‘he is closing, it is finishing’
          'dutse              ‘he closed the whole thing’(1281)    he'boki             ‘he becomes blind’
          he'botse            ‘he is blind’175.These roots were selected from a corpus of about 700 different verbs. Not for every
    verb was obtained information about the possible contrast between possible different
    expressions of the declarative with a zero marked third person subject. Consequently,
    this and other lists presented below do not pretend to be exhaustive.
                                                                      5.2. Mood   289(1282)   i'siki           ‘he is dying, he died, he got drunk, he is drunk’

         xu'rutse         ‘it has become soft (ball, cucumber etc.)’(1289)   tu'ruki          ‘she is waking up’
         tu'rutse         ‘he woke up’(1290)   tsa'siki         ‘is going after (him)’
         tsa'sitse        ‘went after (him)’(1291)   'tseiki          ‘it started (and continues successfully)’ (t)
         'karo 'tseitse   ‘the car started’(1292)   tsitİ'kjaki      ‘he left it upright’
         tsitİ'kjatse     ‘he put it upright’Only three verbs were encountered with which the opposite was observed:(1293)   'İki             ‘he went away’
         'İtse            ‘he goes/went away’(1294)   hã do'teki          ‘the water is leaking/leaked’
         hã do'tetse         ‘the water is leaking (*/leaked)’
290    5. The verb phrase(1295)    la'to kuida'hͿki      ‘I drank yesterday’
          la'to kuida'hͿtse     ‘I’m drinking now as well as yesterday’176Maybe the contrast between the different declaratives has to be understood in
terms of dynamicity. Examples like (1294) and the following suggest that the
choice of the declarative is based on a difference between the interpretations of
the verb as process or state:(1296)    ka'raki               ‘it is dry’
          ka'ratse/kara'tse     ‘it is/has dried’The possibility that the difference is lexicalised or idiomatic cannot be ex-
cluded.
   Finally, there is a small number of verb roots where the difference between
the -ki declarative and the -tse declarative reflects unpredictable differences in
meaning. These differences are certainly lexicalised:(1297)    a'saki                ‘he left (X behind)’
          a'satse               ‘he is separated (from X)’(1298)    'deiki         ‘pull covering leaves from maize cob’, ‘light lantern’

176.The current relevance of situation that has started in a specified past can apparently
    also be expressed more analytically, involving the verb tsicwa- ‘to begin’, in the
    following way: la'to tsi'cwadata kuida'hͿki ‘I have been drinking since yesterday’.
                                                                   5.2. Mood   291(1304)   o'hoja 'uiki         ‘he got the flu’

         ha'retse             ‘it went out’    Note that the aspectual effects and some idiosyncratic properties observed
above are neutralised, or only one of the meanings is selected, when the verb is
in another mood or when overt person marking occurs:(1306)   ja 'bare             ‘is/has already clearing/ed?’
         ja 'jare             ‘is/has already eating/en?’

         ja kuida'hͿtse       ‘I have already drunk’    Apart from the verbs which can occur with both declarative markers in the
zero-marked third person and apart from the many verbs of which there is no
information on which declaratives are required or allowed, there is a small
number of verb roots which may only take one of the declarative markers in the
third person. Again, these roots do not systematically share any formal and se-
mantic characteristics which explain why they belong to the same set. The fol-
lowing set of verbs can only get the declarative morpheme -ki:(1307)   bay-      ‘sour’                      jana'nãitara- ‘thanks’

         jã-       ‘be, be truly, exist’       -Ϳ-           ‘(ATT)’Then there is a number of verbs which only take the -tse declarative under the
same circumstances:(1308)   ai-            ‘want not’        ha're-        ‘disappear’

          hã'rã-      ‘stop’                 -tsy-       ‘(POT)’There are probably many more members to these lists but we lack information
about the (im)possibility of either one of the declarative markers. Furthermore,
the information we have is not always clear. As an example, the verb rai'hͿ-
‘ruin, break down’ was mainly encountered with -tse. However, we cannot add
it to any of the lists above, since we lack conclusive evidence for the possibility
of ?rai'hͿki.177
5.2.1.3. Pragmatic characteristics of -tse vs. -kiAside from semantic factors, there may be a pragmatic condition on the occur-
rence of either of the declarative markers. Verbs are often in the -tse declarative
when the utterance is an answer to a question, or also when a state of affairs is
emphasised or described to someone who was not a witness or who was not
aware of it:(1309)    xare'nͿki            ‘it is in front/turned towards us’
          xare'nͿtse           ‘it is in front/turned towards us (A to Q)’(1310)    la'to kuida'hͿki     ‘yesterday I have drunk/was drinking’
          la'to kuida'hͿtse    ‘yesterday I drank/was drinking (A to Q)’(1311)    'hoiheki             ‘it is not sweet’ (observation made by S)
          hoi'hetse            ‘it is not sweet’ (warning H)
177.This form was not considered very felicitous, but a contrasting translation was pro-
    vided by MA: raihͿ'tse ‘it broke down’ (POR estragou) vs. ?rai'hͿki ‘it is broken
    down’ (POR está estragado).
                                                                    5.2. Mood     293The pragmatic contrast between -ki and -tse as observed in example (1310)
may help to explain why -tse cannot be immediately attached to an overt per-
son marker. If -tse brands the verb as explicitly conveying new and actual in-
formation, an utterance like *kui-da-tse *’I (am) drink(ing)’ is irrelevant be-
cause the hearer is naturally bound to be a (potential) witness of the expressed
fact.
   Note, however, the following dialogue, which suggests that the rule-of-
thumb “answer to a question” is not to be regarded as an absolute criterion for
the occurrence of -tse:(1312)    R:     a'le hedydu'tu-tse
                 axe lose-DEC
                 ‘he lost the axe’          Q:     tsǊhǊ-ra'ti hedydu'tu-re           A:     a'le hedydu'tu-ki
                 what-FOC lose-INT                         axe lose-DEC
                 ‘what did he lose?’                       ‘he lost the axe’Also, other explanations for the difference between the alternatives in (1310)
were offered on another occasion, and are repeated above in (1295).
5.2.1.4. -tse vs. -ki in verbalisation of nounsWhatever the semantic and pragmatic reasons to use one or the other declara-
tive marker, they are all subjected to the formal morphological condition that it
is impossible for an overt person to be followed immediately by -tse. There
seems to be no clear general reason why this should be the case, but there is
one phenomenon that could shed some more light on this problem. Kwaza
nouns can be derived as verbs without further morphological operations.178
Both -ki and -tse can be used. Nouns derived by -ki have an identificational
function, whereas nouns derived by -tse rather seem to have an existential
function:(1313)    e'tay-ki                    Ione e'tay-ki
          woman-DEC                   Ione woman-DEC
          ‘it is a woman’             ‘Ione is a woman’(1314)    e'tay      'a-ki        (1315)        auxwa'na jo-'le-tse
          woman exist-DEC                       meat          manioc-only-DEC
          ‘there is a woman/are women’          ‘there is only meat and manioc’
178.The phenomenon of zero-verbalisation, both in declarative and other moods, is dis-
    cussed as a separate subject in (4.4.9.).
294   5. The verb phrase(1316)    tͅja'wã-tsy-hͿ txa'rwa ko'sa=txuhǊi-tse bare-'nͿ-da-ki
          dark-GER-NOM first          sun=small-DEC      warm-REF-1S-DEC
          ‘because there is a little sun (through clouded sky) I’m warmed up’(1317)    aky-'xİ-tse            (1318)    axy-'na      aky-'hͿ-tse    e'tay
          two-CL:leaf-DEC                  house-LOC two-NOM-DEC woman
          ‘there are two leaves’           ‘in the house live two women’Zero-verbalisation of nouns by -ki is clearly demonstrated in these examples.
However, the verbalisations by -tse are less obvious. In examples (1315) and
(1316) the nouns jo'le ‘only manioc’ and kosatxuhǊi ‘small sun’ are complex:
they consist of nouns derived by a nominal suffix; and in examples (1317) and
(1318) the nouns akyxİ ‘two leaves’ and akyhͿ ‘two things’ consist of a bound
attributive numeral root (see 4.3.2.2.) and a classifier. Unfortunately no exam-
ples of clearer contrast were encountered. This means that the analysis sug-
gested here is a hypothesis that can only be either confirmed or falsified
through further investigation in the field.
    The following examples may point to the same contrast of identification and
existence, but their respective roots are verbal, adverbial and elliptic, not nomi-
nal:(1319)    hã lõ'wͅ-Ϳ-ki             ‘the river is crooked’
          lõ'wͅ-Ϳ-ki                ‘it (~) is crooked/an undulation’
          lõwͅ=lõwͅ=lõ'wͅ-tse       ‘it (~~~~~) is undulating’(1320)    tsİ̘ e-te'te-tse          ‘there is much salt’
          tsİ̘ ele'le-Ϳ-ki          ‘it is very salt’
          hoi ele'le-tse            ‘there are very many bats’(1321)    'he                       ‘no’
          'he-tse                   ‘there isn’t (any)’
          he-'ki                    ‘it isn’t (the case)’, ‘no’
          he-'re                    ‘isn’t it?’, ‘yes’Example (1321) is discussed and possibly explained from different perspective
in (7.1.1.5.).
    The following counter-example, an indentifying zero-verbalisation by -tse,
may find its explanation in the fact that the stem is a personal pronoun:(1322)    'ƭ-tse
          he-DEC
          ‘it was him’A possible counterexample to the hypothesis that -ki does not have an existen-
tial function in zero-verbalisation is:
                                                                   5.2. Mood    295(1323)    darje'mǊ-ki
          rapids-DEC
          ‘there is a rapids in the river’
5.2.1.5. -tse and reported speechOne last difference between -ki and -tse should be mentioned here, if only
briefly. Reported speech in Kwaza is expressed by “cliticisation” of person and
mood marking to direct speech utterances which may already be inflected for
person and mood. The cliticised inflexion refers to the person of the reporting
speaker and the mood in which the report is stated. If the reporting speaker is a
third person and his report is stated in the declarative, not -ki is cliticised, but
-tse:(1324)    ojanͿ-da-'ki-Ø-tse
          arrive-1S-DEC-3-DEC
          ‘he said he arrived’ (lit. ‘he said “I arrived”’)This specific quotative construction occurs also in e.g. desiderative and voli-
tional expressions, where the same restrictions hold. Reported speech, desid-
erative and volitional are the subject of separate sections (5.5.11.; 5.5.13.;
5.2.5.1.). Probably, reported speech may also account for another way in which
zero-verbalisation by cliticisation of -ki may differ from cliticisation of -tse:(1325)    rai?Ϳ'hͿ-ki                     (1326) rai?Ϳ'hͿ-tse
          animal-DEC                               animal-DEC
          ‘it is an animal/it is a thing’          ‘he wants something’
                                          (CX: he came over to ask for e.g. rice)Example (1326) may have a quotative origin and hence mean literally ‘he says
“things”‘ (which would contain an indirect report in this case). This suggests
that there is no real zero-verbalisation going on. Similar pairs were given in
section (4.4.9.) on zero-verbalisation. One indication that this analysis is cor-
rect is provided by the respective negative counterparts of these constructions:(1327)    ipİ'pa etay-'he-tse    (1328)         ipİ'pa e'tay    he'?ai-tse
          Ipepa woman-NEG-DEC                   Ipepa woman want.not-DEC
          ‘Ipepa is not a woman’                ‘Ipepa does not want a woman’In (1327) the zero-verbalised root is negated,179 whereas in (1328) an overt
verbal root is used.","[325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333]"

discussed thoroughly in section (7.1.1.3.). Note also that person cross-reference
markers never occur as elliptic forms by themselves, but that they are always
followed by mood markers. Finally, it should be emphasised that such bound
morpheme sequences only build a phrase by itself in the proper context. Con-
sider the following examples:(3128)   e-'xy       'dai-ty-taxwa-hͿ-ta'dy=jã-ki

         ‘that’s it indeed!’About (3129), the consultant said that it is ungrammatical as such, but that it
can be uttered after someone told you something which you already know.
    The interpretation of elliptic expressions may also depend on more prag-
matic, extralinguistic factors of the context. The following utterances represent
a response to the general (speech) behaviour of the hearer:(3130)   xa-'he-tsy-tse      İ-'ra    mã         ca'ri-hata-'tsi

7.5.2.2. Resumptive particlesIn running monologue, combinations of person and cosubordinative mood
marking are sometimes used as resumptive particles. They link sentences, and
they are often translated by consultants as ‘and then, well, I, then I, so I, she,
well you, and thereafter, yes’ etc. Although these “inflected particles” cannot
be regarded as elements which remain when a root is omitted, they are elliptic:

the following example, the consultant said “if one would have said si ‘I’, this
would have been too strong, as it would mean ‘I myself’”:(3133)    a-'he-xa-wy      oja'nͿ-da-day-hͿ-'ki            da-ta  'Ǌi-da-ta

          again’ (long ago)All subject persons can occur in resumptive particles, as long as the mood
marker is the cosubordinative:(3134)    e'nãi-tja-ja-tsy-'tse      a-xa-'ta    areta-'nã-a-xa-ki

          ‘he is going to quarrel with one, so we, we’re going to learn’The resumptive particle construction is possibly related to cliticisation, as dis-
cussed in (7.5.2.3.), and to quoted speech like constructions, as discussed in
(5.5.11-14.). The monitory mood version of the embedded clause in (3134) re-
sults in a “preventive” construction (see 5.2.9.1.):(3135)    e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi-xa-xa-ta        areta-'nã-xa-xa-ki
          quarrel-TRA-1PO-MON-2-AS-CSO know-FUT-2-AS-DEC
          ‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore you’re going to learn’Note that the impersonal subject marker -na- does not occur in resumptive par-
ticles or as a clitic. From the comparison of (3135) with the following example,
it becomes clear that this function is taken over by the verb root jã- ‘to be’:337336.This sentence was uttered by a mother to her son, explaining why she separated from
    his father.

           ‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore one is going to learn’It is also important to notice that in the third person, -tja is used instead of zero

   denly it popped (loudly): “bang!”‘ (t)It is worthwhile to note here that Mario once said that tja was an equivalent of
the adverbial hesitation interjection haryky ‘now’, ‘uhh..’. It may be that the
origin of the resumptive particles lies in quoted speech constructions. This is
also discussed to a certain extent in (8.3.1.9.).
    Maybe these resumptive particles should really be called anticipating parti-
cles, since they resume a person marker that is actually going to come only
later, in the matrix predicate. It is interesting to consider in this respect the dif-
ferent subject marker -dy-, which occurs exclusively in cosubordinated clause
chains and is never encountered as a part of matrix clause inflexion. It does not
indicate that the present subject is different from the former subject, but that the
next subject will be different from the present. In the next example, the differ-
ent subject cosubordinative marker even occurs twice as a “resumptive” parti-
cle:(3139)     hary'ky 'tana hͿ-'dy-ta             'nãi-ta bu-'dy-damͿ

    put forward in (5.1.7.) and (7.2.11.).
338.This fact represents further corroboration of the statements made in section (8.3.1.4.)
    to the effect that -tja is not only a manner adverbial clause marker, but also a fully
    fledged cosubordinative marker.
584    7. Other morphosyntactic structures          ‘then, well, like that he made the nuts starting to fall, but then ...
          (someone else did something totally different)’ (t)Here the omitted root is unidentifiable. The inflexions occur as abstract con-
junctional particles whose only function is to indicate that the next clause has a
different subject.339 From the point of view of the cosubordinate marker, how-
ever, these elliptic elements can be seen as resumptive. The cosubordinate
marker reminds the hearer of the fact that everything which precedes is part of
the same medial clause chain, regardless of whether any matrix moods have al-
ready passed by. The real end of this clause chain is only the final matrix clause
of the entire story. Even when the story is interrupted by a listener posing a
question, it can be resumed by a resumptive particle:(3140)    S: aru-'rjͿ-wa-hͿ-herejã-re
             place-CD:area-IS-NOM-APPL-INT
             ‘... they place (the jar with chicha) on the ground, you know’          H: 'kui-dy-ja-da-'te-cwa-hͿ

             yes       IS-CSO night-IDS-CSO
             ‘yes, then they, when night falls ...’ (t)So the elements which I have called “resumptive” here, both have a prospective
property, which is expressed in the person marker, and a resumptive property,
which is expressed in the cosubordination marker.
   Note that veritable omission of a root can have a truly resumptive effect:(3141)    areta-'he-da-kywy 'si-dy-hͿ tã'jã e'nãi-tja-ta-tsy-tse [...]

          ‘if I don’t learn, my chief will quarrel with me ..., he will with me, so
          I, I’m going to learn’In this example, the inflexional part of the last predicate of a clause is repeated
after a short pause, the event is in fact resumed, in order to connect it as back339.See (8.3.2.1.5.) and (8.3.2.2.1.) for the “discontinuative” function of the different
    subject marker and the inflected swith reference mood when used as a resumptive
    particle.
340.The purposive construction is explained in (5.5.12.).

is repeated, but the root omitted could be taken to symbolise such back-
grounding in an iconical manner.341
7.5.2.3. CliticisationThere are several grammatical constructions in which person and/or mood oc-
cur relatively deep inside the predicate. These are morphological constructions
which contain multiple person and mood markers, such as the quoted speech
constructions:(3142)     kukuihͿ-da-'ki-da-ki
           ill-1S-DEC-1S-DEC
           ‘I said I am ill’In this example, the grammatical subject of the quoted utterance, the speaker
and the person who quotes are identical. If the quoted person would be a sec-
ond person, the construction would be as follows (note that this alternative ex-
ample was constructed by myself):(3143)     kukuihͿ-da-'ki-xa-ki
           ill-1S-DEC-2-DEC
           ‘you said “I am ill”‘If the grammatical subject of the quoted utterance would be a second person,
the construction would be reversed, as follows (note that this example was con-
structed by myself):(3144)     kukuihͿ-xa-'ki-da-ki
           ill-2-DEC-1S-DEC
           ‘I said “you are ill”‘Also the declarative mood markers can be exchanged for any other mood
marker. In section (5.5.11.) the quoted speech constructions are discussed thor-
oughly. In (5.5.11.1.) the hypothesis is elaborated upon that these constructions
originate from ellipsis of a verb root for ‘to speak’.","[617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623]"

tive presupposition held by the speaker:(2800)     ƭ-'wã     'rai?ͿhͿ       mã=duhͿ-ty-a-'ni=xa-he-re      ͅrjãwã-'na

303.Note that the glossing of -ni as exhortative represents a literal interpretation of a con-
    struction that may be also analysed as causational (like in the next example).

           ‘I was not happy for nothing, they’ve really arrived’304Emphatic use of the interrogative was discussed in (5.2.2.1.).
    In sections (5.2.7-10.) three special prohibitive moods were identified and
described: negative imperative, negative exhortative and monitory. They form
the respective counterparts to the three persuasive moods imperative, exhorta-
tive causative and volitive.
    Only the negation of the exhortative is transparent in the sense that the
negative marker -he- precedes exhortative -ni. There is a less transparent, non-
discontinuous, negative exhortative -ini, but this has only been attested in rela-
tively fixed expressions. Negative exhortative is discussed in (5.2.8.).
    The negative imperative also contains the identifiable negative marker -he-,
but the mood marker is different: -ky. Even though the negative imperative may
be expressed in a discontinuous way, the element -ky does not occur as a mood
marker without -he- (see 5.2.7.). Only few instances of negation of the impera-
tive as marked by -ra were attested:(2803)     ehͿ-'he-ca-ra            (*ehͿhecaky)
           make-NEG-EMP-IMP
           ‘don’t do that!’305Apparently, the alternative mild imperative which involves the potential marker
-tsy- and which is discussed in (5.2.3.1.) can also be negated with -he-:(2804)     tsuhǊ-'du-xa-lİ    nãi-xa-'he-tsy-tse
           what-BER-2-PREC like-2-NEG-POT-DEC
           ‘you are not going to do thus, because (he is your son)’ (t)   A real negative counterpart of the volitive was not attested. Instead, there is
a monitory mood which was discussed in (5.2.9.). It is marked by monomor-
phemic -tsi, which bears no formal resemblance to the negative morpheme.","[564, 565, 566]"

5.1.2. Inclusive referenceThe morpheme -a- marks the first person inclusive subject, i.e. ‘we’ including
the hearer. It is distinct from the first person exclusive subject morpheme
-a-xa- ‘we’ excluding the hearer and thereby including only third persons. The
same distinction is reflected by the respective pronominal counterparts: txa'na
‘we (inclusive)’ and tsi'tsİ ‘we (exclusive)’.(1090)    tsi'tsİ  esi'ki luze-'wã    wa'dy-a-xa-hͿ-ki

         ‘Luzeu gave (it) to us’As the following examples show, the object marker -eteja- may either refer to
an inclusive or an exclusive object:(1094)   (tjana-'wã) 'mİ̘-eteja-ki         (1095)   xyi'tsİ axe'hͿ-ete'ja-xa-ki

         ‘he is going to give us (resp.IN/EX)’It may be the case that the inclusive pronoun in the object function is not obli-
gatorily marked for animate object case, while the exclusive is:(1097)   lu'zeu   wa'dy-eteja-hͿ-ki      'txana(-wã) /     'tsitsİ-'wã
         Luzeu give-1PO-NOM-DEC we.IN-AO /                 we.EX-AO
         ‘Luzeu gave to us (resp.IN/EX)’   It was not registered what the difference is between a second person plural
object form occurring in combination with an exclusive subject form and with
an inclusive subject form:(1098)   wa'dy-etele'tay-a-xa-ki     (1099)      wa'dy-etele'tay-a-ki

-ja- in (5.1.4.3.).
258   5. The verb phrase5.1.3. Exclusive referenceIn section (4.7.2.), reference was made to the occurrence of “incompatible”
combination of the inclusive pronoun with exclusive cross-reference marking
was noticed:(1100)    tja'nã    ƭle'le-a-xa-ki
          we.IN     together-1P-AS-DEC
          ‘we are together (married/brother-sister/kin)’(1101)    txa'nã / tsi'tsİ      Ǌ'ce-a-xa-hͿ-ki    arǊi-'du-a-xa-ta
          we.IN      / we.EX trap-1P-AS-NOM-DEC tapir-BER-1P-AS-CSO
          ‘(it is) we who made a trap for a tapir’It is unclear what the function of these “incompatible” combinations is. One
could imagine that (1100) has an affective connotation, or that the exclusion of
the hearer is emphasised. Or maybe the examples reflect evasive use of the dis-
tinction, i.e. one tries to avoid to be specific. The choice between pronouns in
(1101) is not problematic as far as the nature of interrogative context is re-
garded: this utterance was the answer to a question and the person who asked
the question is by definition excluded from the proposition, because otherwise
he would not have asked. Note that the combination of exclusive tsitsİ with in-
clusive -a- inflexion tends to be considered really ungrammatical, so there is an
asymmetry:Table 24. Compatibility of inclusive and exclusive reference

          ‘we’re hitting (him)’whereas: *tjana mͅ?axaki and *tjana mͅ?aki were rejected altogether, can be
explained by pragmatic anomaly, as here it could be argued that it is very un-
usual to make a remark “we’re beating him up” to a participant in the action. It
is more natural to utter this phrase to a bystander, e.g. as an answer to his or her
questions about what is going on.

definite cross-reference forms as far as their shape is regarded. Nonetheless,
this overlap is rather limited. Furthermore, a number of semantic and gram-
matical differences are involved, such as the fact that no corresponding pro-
nouns are possible.156 For these reasons, indefinite arguments are treated as a
category in itself. It involves two basic parameters: indefinite subject, which is
formally represented by the morpheme -wa-, and indefinite object, which is
formally represented by the morpheme -ja-. This category only surfaces in the
form of cross-reference morphemes. In fact, indefinite argument cross-
reference tends to preclude the expression of an overt argument.","[294, 295, 296, 297]"

tative morpheme -ni and the part ƭ- to the pronoun ƭ ‘he’.

               Subordination and coordination
The preceding chapters concerned the basic parts of speech and their morphol-
ogy. The present chapter deals with complex constructions, or, to be more pre-
cise, the morphology of verbs in complex clause constructions. In Kwaza there
are three types of clauses: matrix clauses, subordinate clauses and medial
clauses. A full sentence always consists of a matrix clause. The morphological
properties of the constituents of single matrix clauses, such as case marking,
person and mood marking and derivational extension, were discussed in the
previous sections. A full sentence may also consist of a complex matrix clause
that contains other, non-matrix clauses such as adverbial clauses. The verb that
bears matrix clause morphology is usually sentence-final. The (co-) subordi-
nated clauses normally precede the matrix verb. The difference between all
these types of clauses is signalled by verbal morphology, especially by inflex-
ional endings.
    Subordinate clauses are discussed in section (8.2.) on adverbial clauses and
section (8.4.) on nominal clauses. Apart from subordinate clauses, Kwaza also
has clauses which are semantically coordinated with the matrix clause, but
which are morphosyntactically subordinated to the matrix clause, and which
may form multiple clause chains. These clauses are discussed in (8.3.), and I
have called them “cosubordinated” or “medial” clauses. In spite of the fact that
Kwaza has no conjunctional element which means ‘and’, functional coordina-
tion of noun phrases is nonetheless possible. This is discussed in (8.5.). Finally,
there are some specific syntactic constructions the grammatical structure of
which is interpreted in more or less ideosyncratic ways. Such special construc-
tions form a sort of templates which convey notions such as habituality. This is
dealt with in (8.6.). The first subsection of this chapter, (8.1.), is an exposition
on the bound morpheme -tsy-, which has several different functions, and which
is treated here because of its importance in complex clause constructions.","[642, 643]"

7.5.2.4. Abstract ellipsisAbout elliptic responses as discussed in (7.5.2.1.), one could say that the spe-
cific root is physically absent but that it is understood, and identifiable from the
context. About quoted speech as discussed in (7.5.2.3.) one could maintain that
a verb root of speech was deleted. However, most quoted speech constructions
would be ungrammatical without such deletion, because it would result in jux-
taposition of matrix clause predicates. Finally, it seems that the resumptive use
of inflexions as discussed in (7.5.2.2.) does not involve easily identifiable
omitted verb roots at all. In the present subsection I will discuss some root
omissions which may be even more abstract.
    In section (8.2.2.3.) concessive adverbial clause constructions involving the
subordinator =wara ‘but’ are discussed. This element is always preceded by a
nominaliser, usually -hͿ. The nominaliser is normally preceded by the verbal
root of the adverbial clause predicate. However, the morphological complex
-hͿ=wara can also occur independently, as a concessive conjunctional particle,
forming a link between sentences or sections of the discourse. Although this is
also amply illustrated in (8.2.2.3.) I will give an example of it here:(3151)    oja-e'te-da-tsy-tse        zezƭju-dy-'rjͿ      hͿ=wara

          want.not-1S-DEC
          ‘we are going together to Zezinho, but I don’t want to, no’    The same abstract kind of ellipsis was observed in quoted speech construc-
tions, when the verbal root of the quoted phrase was omitted. Compare the
following examples from (8.1.2.2.):(3152)    la'to        'masiju kukuihͿ-da-'ki-tsy-hͿ-ki

          ‘yesterday, Marcio said he is ill’

          GER-NOM-DEC
          ‘he says yes / he says so’Example (3153) can be used as if tsy- were a verb root meaning ‘to say’ or a
third person singular cross-reference morpheme. It may be an elliptic version of
(3311), but it may apparently also function as a response to questions like ‘was
Marcio ill yesterday?’:(3154)    la'to       tsicwata     'masiju kukui'hͿ-hͿ-re
          yesterday begin-CSO Marcio ill-NOM-INT
          ‘did Marcio become ill yesterday?’(3155)  tsy-'hͿ-ki
        GER-NOM-DEC
        ‘he says so / it is said’344
The same situation exists with respect to the following examples:(3156)    tsy-'nãixwa-wa-ki                   (3157)      'tse-cwa-ki
          GER-SIMU-IS-DEC                                 DEC-IS-DEC
          ‘they pretend to be talking’                    ‘it is said (that...)’Speech quotations can be extended also with further morphology, e.g. the frus-
trative morpheme -le- (see 8.2.2.2.). Compare the following examples:(3158)    haru'wi 'ja-a-tsy-'tse-tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
          Luiz      eat-1P-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘Luiz invited us for dinner, now what to do?’ (it isn’t possible)(3159)    tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
          GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘he said that; however, unfortunately I can’t’, ‘what a pity’Example (3159) is the elliptic version of (3158), but it can also be uttered for
example as an elliptic response to someone saying ‘Luiz invited us to eat!’, as
if it were a lamentative predicate itself.
     Also other morphemes, such as repetitive -je?e- ‘again’ and negative -he-
followed by person and mood marking can occur elliptically, without there be-
ing a specific verb root which is understood:(3160)    je'?e-wa-si
          again-IS-SWR
          ‘they explained again’, ‘they did it again’ (etc.)344.Although the consultant added that hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes’ would have been a better answer.

         ‘I (spoke, did, etc.) again’                   ‘when one is nothing’   Finally it was suggested in (5.2.3.4.) and (5.5.11.1.) that certain verbs of
speech may have derived from elliptic constructions. These verbs, and also
modal verb roots like damͿ- in (3150) can still be considered as elliptic in a
way. However, the actual omission may have become so abstract as to be only
symbolic now.","[626, 627, 628]"
"
5.4.6. Reflexive and middle -nӻ-Kwaza has a reflexive morpheme -nͿ-, which is applied before person
cross-reference morphology. It indicates that the subject affects itself:(1847)    cari-'nͿ-da-mͿ                   (1848)    mİ̘-'nͿ-wa-ki
          shoot-REF-1S-VOL                           beat-REF-IS-DEC
          ‘I’m going to kill myself’                 ‘they beat themselves’(1849)    'marju wi-ko'je-ki
          Mario cut-CL:hand-DEC
          ‘Mario cut someone in the hand’(1850)    'marju koreja-('ko) wi-koje-nͿ-('hͿ)-ki
          Mario knife-INS cut-CL:hand-REF-NOM-DEC
          ‘Mario cut himself in the hand with a knife’(1851)    'marju kore'ja wi-koje-nͿ-'dy-hͿ-ki
          Mario knife        cut-CL:hand-REF-CAU-NOM-DEC
          ‘the knife cut Mario in the hand (because of his own fault)’The verb roots dohͿ- ‘to pour liquid’, isihͿ- ‘to secure something’ and isixwe-
‘to medicate’ appear to be discontinuous when the reflexive morpheme is ap-
plied:(1852)    do-nͿ-hͿ-'nã-da-ki         (1853)       i'si-nͿ-'to-ki
          leak-REF-NOM-FUT-1S-DEC                 secure-REF-CL:seed-DEC
          ‘I’m going to make myself wet’          ‘he holds, grabs his own penis’(1854)    inͿsi'xwe-ki
          medicate.REF-DEC
          ‘he is taking medicine, he is treating himself’Here, -nͿ- occurs inside the root, as if it is an infix. This may not be so strange
in the roots of example (1852) and (1853), because the element -hͿ- can appar-
ently be disconnected (and become replaced by a specific classifier, in this case
-to- ‘seed’). However, in the root of example (1854), which may contain an al-
lomorphic variant of the classifier -tswe- ‘(medicinal) root’, the element -nͿ- is

above.
    The morpheme -nͿ- has also a detransitivising effect without being reflexive
in the sense that the subject acts on itself:(1855)     lo'tİ dai'txa-da-ki                   lo'tİ daitxa-'nͿ-tse

           ‘I striped it’                        ‘it is striped’Although Kwaza does not have a distinct passive voice, this construction re-
sembles a kind of middle voice construction. Notice that with the verb root
uitsİ̘rjͿ- ‘to hang’ the reflexive morpheme has a middle function, as in example
(1863), whereas the reflexive function is zero-expressed, as in (1864):(1862)     loko'tja uitsİ̘'rjͿ-da-ki             (1863)    i'tso         uitsİ̘'rjͿ-nͿ-ki

           ‘the monkey hangs (itself actively by its tail from a branch)’232.Note that the root isi- ‘to die’ may be related to isixwe- ‘to medicate’.
378    5. The verb phraseThe semantics of some Kwaza verbs require a reflexive reading when inflected
for a first person subject. In case the reflexive morpheme is added it has the ef-
fect of wilfulness:233(1865)     e'te-ta-ki
           pierce-1O-DEC
           ‘I was pierced (e.g. my foot got pierced by a thorn)’(1866)     e'te-da-ki
           pierce-1S-DEC
           ‘I pierced myself (i.e. I caused myself to have e.g. my foot pierced)’(1867)     e'te-nͿ-da-ki
           pierce-REF-1S-DEC
           ‘I pierced myself (on purpose)’   As explained in (5.3.) the reflexive morpheme is also used as a directional
with the sense ‘hither’:(1868)     le'ja-da-ki                      (1869)     leja-'nͿ-da-ki
           ahead-1S-DEC                                ahead-REF-1S-DEC
           ‘I’m going ahead’                           ‘I went/came ahead’When used as a directional, -nͿ- can be applied to both transitive and intransi-
tive verbs. However it is not interpretable as reflexive or as detransitivising:(1870)     ko'sa     waja-nͿ-'ra
           lantern bring-REF-IMP
           ‘bring the lantern hither!’The directional use of -nͿ-, which is discussed more extensively in (5.3.), may
be derived from the middle interpretation of the reflexive.
   The reflexive morpheme may be lexicalised in the noun akynͿ ‘friend’,
which is apparently derived from the attributive verb root aky- ‘two’.
   The answer in the following little dialogue is not well understood. The ele-
ment -nͿ- is not reflexive there, and it occurs after person cross-reference:(1871)     R:     'si-dy-hͿ 'bu-xa-ki
                  I-POS-NOM wear-2-DEC
                  ‘you’re wearing my hat! (indignated)’

                ‘yes, I’m using your hat (laconically)’
5.4.7. Reciprocal -lİ-Reciprocity in Kwaza is expressed by the morpheme -lİ-. It is applied to transi-
tive or transitivised verbal bases and it occurs before cross-reference marking:(1872)   peDru sa'Bina huruja-'lİ-ki

         we .EX beat-RECI-1P-AS-DEC
         ‘it was we ourselves who beat one another’   With the verb root oitsi- ‘to copulate sexually, fuck’ the reciprocal mor-
pheme may have a more human connotation:(1883)   oi'tsi-ki                     oitsi-'lİ-ki
         copulate-DEC                  copulate-RECI-DEC
         ‘(animal) is mating’          ‘human is having sex’   With the verb root wady- ‘to give’, the reciprocal morpheme suggests that
many people are involved in the action of giving, and this is not necessarily a
reciprocal action:(1884)   wady-'lİ-(wa)-ki
         give-RECI-IS-DEC
         ‘they are giving (things) to one another/to a multitude’In the case of few people, reflexive -nͿ- would be inserted in addition to -lİ-,
and the action would be reciprocal:(1885)   wa-nͿ-dy-'lİ-ki
         give-REF-CAU-RECI-DEC
         ‘they are giving (things) to one another’Note again that -nͿ- is inserted in a strange place, inside the root.
    There are no reflexive or reciprocal pronouns in Kwaza. There is a lexeme
which has in a way a restricted comitative sense, ƭlİlİ ‘them together, them-
selves, just them’. On another occasion, the consultant explained that ƭlİlİ was
also used to refer to ‘a couple’, e.g. ‘two Westerners’, ‘two brothers’, ‘two In-
dians’, but also: ‘a group of only Germans’, etc. Formally it may consist of the
pronoun ƭ ‘he’, and a reciprocal morpheme -lİ- or the emphatic morpheme -le-
‘just, only’, or both. It is used as a contrastive answer to questions like: ‘John
comes with whom?’, answer: ƭlİlİ ‘no, he is coming only with his brother’; ‘is
he married to a Brazilian?’, answer: ƭlİlİ ‘no, he is together with her (the one
you know)’. The categorial status of ƭlİlİ is ambiguous. In the next example it
is used as a verb stem:(1886)   tja'nã    ƭlİ'lİ-a-xa-ki
         we.IN     together-1P-AS-DEC
         ‘we are together (through marriage or kinship)’The incompatibility of the inclusive pronoun with exclusive cross-reference in
this example is discussed in (5.1.3.).

The group indicated by ƭlİlİ is not defined arbitrarily, by people who happen to
accompany one another. It indicates rather that people stand in a fundamental
reciprocal relation to one another, from which others are excluded as if by na-
ture. Because of this semantic characteristic, which seems to be supported by
formal traits such as -lİ-, I have discussed this element in the present section,
and not below, in the section on the comitative.","[414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419]"

1.11. Organisation of the present workThis book consists of three parts: a grammar (part I), texts (part II) and a dic-
tionary (part III). It is an attempt to describe the Kwaza language. It neither
follows a specific theoretical model, nor does it examine theoretical implica-
tions of the analysis. Its primary concern is to prevent the Kwaza language
from disappearing without leaving behind representative documentation. The
description is intended to be comprehensive and dependable, so that theoretical
issues can be dealt with in later studies.
    The basic orientation of this grammar is formal rather than functional, that
is, the structure of the present description is determined by the productive
forms of the language and the way they are used, rather than by possible
grammatical functions and the way these are realised by the grammatical sys-
tem. Nevertheless, the sections are not always located where they could be ex-
pected to be on formal grounds. The subsection about classifiers (4.2.) is rele-
vant both for nominal and verbal morphology. Since classification is important
for a complete understanding of attributive modification, numerals and demon-
stratives, I have discussed it prior to these. The subsections which concern ad-
verbial affixes (6.2.4.) have been placed together, because I deemed it conven-
ient to have all adverbial morphology in one place rather than scattered
throughout the book. Finally, the chapter on complex constructions (8.) also
has a basis in verbal morphology. However, since that morphology is charac-
teristic for subordinate clauses, its grammatical domain is greater than that of
the verb alone. Therefore, I have discussed it after the sections on nouns, verbs
and adverbs. The subsections of (8.) together provide a complete account of
subordinate clause formation. If a strictly formal arrangement were followed,
the discussion of subordinate constructions would become highly fragmented.
Additionally, some minor subsections have been assigned to chapters on func-
tional grounds, such as (5.1.7.) on the impersonal use of the special verb root
jã- ‘to be’, although they are also mentioned in chapters where they belong
formally (in this case 7.6.2.).
    In the present work the subject of morpheme order has not been discussed
thoroughly. Its basic characteristics are dealt with briefly in (3.2.) as a separate
issue. Otherwise, it is only discussed in an ad hoc manner in those places where
it is of immediate importance for identification or proper understanding of a
specific morpheme, such as e.g. the negative morpheme -he- in (7.1.).
    With regard to the internal organisation of the subsections, I have striven to
discuss the most common constructions, and the examples which serve to il-
lustrate them, first, and the more exceptional ones towards the end of these
subsections.
28    1. Introduction    The examples are as much as possible in a phonemic spelling, but phonetic
variation is sometimes indicated. I found this necessary since not all questions
that concern the underlying phonological structures of Kwaza may have been
answered satisfactorily yet.34 Word boundary is symbolised by a space < > and
morpheme boundary by a hyphen <->, or, in the case of compounds (and
sometimes cliticisation), by the equation sign <=>. A dot <.> occurs between
multiple component elements of an English gloss corresponding to a single
morpheme in Kwaza. The presence of a glottal stop <?> is not indicated in
automatic positions, provided that these positions are preceded by a space, hy-
phen or equation sign (see the discussion concerning the glottal stop in 2.2.2.).
    The main stress of polysyllabic words is usually symbolised by an apostro-
phe <'> preceding the stressed syllable (see 2.8.).35 In chapter (2.) stress is only
indicated in the phonetic transcriptions, since it is not analysed as phonemic.
However, because the proposed rules of stress placement are sometimes not
consistent with stress placement in actual spontaneous data, main stress as ob-
served is always indicated in the rest of the work, even though the notation of
the glossed examples is largely phonemic. When a word contains two stress
markers it has not been possible to determine which one of them was main and
which one was secondary. Very long derived or compounded words may con-
tain several main stress positions. The precise determination of the rules with
regard to stress is a matter of future research.
    The free translations of the examples are based as directly as possible on the
Portuguese translations given of the Kwaza phrases by the consultants them-
selves. Because the notion “sentence” in Kwaza has not been thoroughly ex-
plored I have avoided the use of capitals and full stops in both the Kwaza mate-
rial and the free translations. The main exceptions to this concern proper names
and quoted utterances in the free translations.","[65, 66]"
"
4.2.2. The types of classifiersThe morphemes illustrated above appear to behave like classifiers, but are they
truly classifiers? The answer to this question is important for the assessment of
the nature of Kwaza morphology. Many Kwaza classifiers behave as if they
were the second element in a compound, which is otherwise practically only
attested with Kwaza verbs. In other constructions, the behaviour of classifiers
shows resemblance to incorporation. In order to determine whether some es-
sential differences emerge, I have roughly ordered the morphemes I consider to
be classifiers into sections according to their etymology.
    In the very first subsection (4.2.2.1.) I discuss the use of the nominaliser -hͿ
as a neutral classifier. The following three subsections contain an inventory of
all known specific classifiers. In section (4.2.2.2.) I listed the classifiers which
have no fully transparent etymological relation to the nouns they classify. In
the next section (4.2.2.3.) I listed those which seem to be only slightly adapted
or reduced versions of the independent nouns with which they are referentially
identical. The final section (4.2.2.4.) lists those classifiers which can only ap-
pear as an independent noun when attached to the empty root e-.",[175]
"
8.3.1.5. Indefinite subject marking in medial clauses: -(c)waIn cosubordinations with an indefinite subject, the indefinite subject marker
-wa- (see 5.1.4.1.) is applied to both the medial clause and the matrix clause:(3510)    dodotxi'tİ o'hui-wa-ta        'nãi-wa-ki
          ball         play-IS-CSO      like-IS-DEC
          ‘they do that (because they) are playing ball’379There is a variant of -wa- which seems to have exactly the same semantic
value: -cwa-. The following examples demonstrate its use:(3511)    aky-'ta e'mã-cwa-ta       'mİ̘-eteja-wa-ki
          two-ANI more-IS-CSO beat-1PO-IS-DEC
          ‘they were with three persons who beat us’379.This phrase could be uttered as an answer to questions of someone who is unac-
    quainted with the game. If his questions are very stupid one could use a more exple-
    tive matrix clause 'nãi-wa-he'rejã're ‘they do that of course, you fool!’.
664   8. Subordination and coordination(3512)   oja-'nã-cwa-ta     'kui-wa-ki
         leave-FUT-IS-CSO drink-IS-DEC
         ‘because they are preparing to go they drink up’(3513)   tsuhǊ-'du-cwa-ta kunͿ-'djo-wa-re          coha-si'ki
         what-BER-IS-CSO dress-CL:foot-IS-INT foot-CL:skin
         ‘why (for what purpose) are they putting on shoes?’The occurrence of -cwa- is restricted to cosubordinative constructions where it
seems to be a perfectly optional variant:(3514)   'İ-(c)wa-ta 'hu-wa-ki
         go-IS-CSO smoke-IS-DEC
         ‘she went (home and is) smoking’Notice that within a cosubordination construction, -cwa- may be attached to
either of the concomitant clauses. In the next examples -cwa- is applied to the
matrix clause where it corefers with -wa- or even with zero in the medial
clause:(3515)   hiuDu'?uru-nã      'a-wa-ta        onİ-'he-cwa-ki     Ϳ-hͿ-'ko
         Rio.do.Ouro-LOC exist-IS-CSO       arrive-NEG-IS-DEC this-NOM-INS
         ‘being stuck in Rio do Ouro they have not arrived here (yet)’(3516)   tsuhǊ-'nã-ta      hyhyrwa-'nã-cwa-re
         what-FUT-CSO      move-FUT-IS-INT
         ‘why are they going for a walk?’For the latter example, cf. the discussion with regard to (3488). In the next ex-
ample (which corresponds to 1132), optional variant of -wa-, i.e. -cwa-, in the
matrix clause corefers with -cwa- in the medial clause:(3517)   aky-'hͿ    e'mã-cwa-ta    'dai-(c)wa-ki       ('manga)
         two-NOM more-IS-CSO take-IS-DEC               mango
         ‘someone took three (mangoes)’
8.3.1.6. Object marking in cosubordinationNo special object forms or constructions are involved in cosubordination. Ob-
ject markers occur on either of the concomitants of cosubordination construc-
tions, as is shown e.g. in (3504), (3511) and in the following example:
                                           8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   665(3518)    hoi hy'hyrwa-ki         hadai-ja-'nã-tja
          bat fly-DEC             bite-IO-FUT-CSO
          ‘the bat is flying around as he wants to suck people’s blood’
8.3.1.7. Functions of the medial clauseThe chaining of medial clauses is basically employed to express sheer con-
secutiveness of events:(3519)    ã'rǊi a're-da-ta o'ja-da-ki
          tapir turn-1S-CSO leave-1S-DEC
          ‘I turned into a tapir and went away’Often one of the verbs in a clause chain can be considered as a complement of
reason, cause or purpose of the other verb. The purposive nature of such com-
plements is usually determined by affixes like future second person object
-leja-, future -nã- in the sense of ‘will, want’, volitional modal -damͿ- ‘want’
or by exhortative and imperative mood affixes to which the cosubordinative
marker is then cliticised:(3520)    pİ̘rİ̘jã-tja-le'ja-da-ta     oja'nͿ-da-ki
          speak-TRA-2O.FUT-1S-CSO arrive-1S-DEC
          ‘I came here to talk with you’(3521)    pİ̘rİ̘jã-tja-'nã-da-ta    oja'nͿ-da-ki
          speak-TRA-FUT-1S-DEC arrive-1S-DEC
          ‘I came to talk with him’(3522)    Ǌcenãi-da'mͿ-xa-ta erewe-'xy-xa-ki
          know-want-2-CSO        write-CL:leaf-2-DEC
          ‘you are writing in order to learn’(3523)    pİ̘rİ̘'jã-tja-a-'ni-da-ta  oja'nͿ-da-ki
          speak-TRA-1P-EXH-1S-DEC arrive-1S-DEC
          ‘I came for us to talk’380(3524)    pİ̘rİ̘jã-tja-'ra-da-ta     waja-'nͿ-da-ki
          speak-TRA-IMP-1S-DEC bring-REF-1S-DEC
          ‘I brought him for you to talk with him’
          (lit. ‘saying “you talk with him!”, I got him hither’)380.See also the remarks about the same example (3145) in (7.5.2.3.).
666    8. Subordination and coordinationHowever, the medial clause can also have a purposive sense without such
means, aside from its purely consecutive function:(3525)    pİ̘rİ̘jã-'tja-da-ta     oja'nͿ-da-ki
          speak-TRA-1S-DEC        arrive-1S-DEC
          ‘I talked to him and I came’ (i.e. I came authorised)(3526)    pİ̘rİ̘jã-tja-'ja-da-ta     oja'nͿ-da-ki
          speak-TRA-IO-1S-DEC        arrive-1S-DEC
          ‘I came here to talk with them’ (i.e. I came here for us to talk)  As suggested in the introduction, a clause ending in a cosubordinate mood
marker may also function as an adverbial clause:(3527)    txu'hǊi-tja hǊnǊ-'dy-da-ki              (3528)    txu'hǊi-tja a'we-tse
          small-CSO scorch-CAU-1S-DEC                       small-CSO rain-DEC
          ‘I burnt the food (just) a little’                ‘it rained a little’Notice that it is not really possible to speak of same subject medial clauses in
(3527) and (3528), because the matrix subject is different from that of the me-
dial clause. Furthermore, this subject discontinuity is not marked in the ex-
pected manner as discussed in (8.3.2.). These adverbial clauses are probably
subordinate clauses which modify the verb root of the matrix clause only. They
do not cosubordinate a second proposition to the matrix clause proposition, like
medial clauses do.
   Cosubordinate mood verbs which are used in coordinative constructions are
discussed in (8.3.1.10.).","[701, 702, 703, 704]"
"      7.1.1.).
                                                                    5.2. Mood    2975.2.2. InterrogativeThe interrogative mood marker -re (sometimes also pronounced as [4İ]) is at-
tached to the very same person markers as the declarative. The third person
singular remains the zero-marked form.(1330)    tsu'hǊ pİ̘rİ̘'jã-xa-re     (1331)     di'lİ 'cu-re
          what      speak-2-INT                 who cut-INT
          ‘what are you saying?’                ‘who is cutting (felling the tree)?’Certain forms are obviously difficult to elicit in the field. As mentioned above
in (5.2.1.), the declarative of the second person normally elicits imperative or
interrogative forms. Similarly, the imperative and interrogative combined with
an adjacent first person marker are best elicited in offered contexts that are con-
sidered absurd or ironic, etc.(1332)    hã     kui-da-'re            (1333)      hyhyrwa-'hͿ-a-re
          water drink-1S-INT                       move-NOM-1P-INT
          ‘am I (going to) drinking water?’        ‘is it we who are walking?’180In future tenses, the first person interrogative is less extraordinary. The fol-
lowing example was elicited in the context of a group discussion addressing the
question of who is going to be sent on an unpleasant mission:(1334)    o'ja-da-tsy-'re     (better than o'jada're)
          leave-1S-POT-INT
          ‘am I going (to leave)?’Also in certain past constructions the first person interrogative may occur:(1335)    ti-'rjͿ         a'sa-da-re
          what-CD:area leave-1S-INT
          ‘where did I put it?’   When person and interrogative mood inflexion of a question are omitted,
there is a notable rise of intonation on the last syllable of the interrogative verb:(1336)    tyka'?o
          visit
          ‘(are you) promenading/strolling?’
180.The sentence created by myself which contained a first person exclusive form
    *hyhyrwa-'nã-axa-re *’are we going for a walk or what?’ was rejected by MA who
    explained it was “contrariant”.
298   5. The verb phrase5.2.2.1. Emphatic uses of the interrogativeThere is a number of fixed constructions which require among other things an
interrogative matrix verb, but which do not really have an interrogative sense.
Their common characteristic is their emphatic nature. The interrogative can ex-
press indignation:(1337)   (tsuhǊ) 'dyrãrã=dyitxƭ'rjͿ-xa-re
         what      noise=noise.make-2-INT
         ‘what is this noise you’re making (with empty cans)?’(1338)   pİ̘rİ̘'jã=dyitxi'rjͿ-xa-re
         speak=noise.make-2-INT
         ‘how noisily are you conversing!’(1339)   kui-'re=tja    'ta-wa-ta
         drink-INT=CSO talk-IS-CSO
         ‘they’re complaining that he does nothing but drink’(1340)   kui-xa-'re=tja      'ta-wa-ta
         drink-2-INT=CSO talk-IS-CSO
         ‘they say that you do nothing but drink’The interrogative is required in an expletive construction with the particle
ku'kui ‘wow!/yecch!/damn!/how strange!’, which is derived from the verb root
kukui- ‘hurt’ (see 7.7.6.):(1341)   ku'kui ñãsi-'he-da-re        (1342)    ku'kui kara'ra-Ϳ-re
         wow!      hear-NEG-1S-INT              wow!      meagre-ATT-INT
         ‘damn, I can’t hear anything’          ‘gosh, he is meagre!’(1343)   kawa'pe      ku'kui nͿ-'hͿ-re
         cockroach wow!        big-NOM-INT
         ‘why, that cockroach is big!’(1344)   jerexwa-co'ha ku'kui      cu=hy'hydwa-'re-da-hͿ-ki
         jaguar-foot   wow!        step=go.path-INT-1S-NOM-DEC         zjwãu-dy-jãhã-'na
         João-POS-CL:path-LOC
         ‘gosh I saw MANY jaguar traces on the road to João!’The interrogative is required in the expression of relief that something did not
happen. This construction also involves the first person inclusive pronoun
txana and the procrastinative morpheme -tjara-, which is a variant of -tara-:
                                                                      5.2. Mood     299(1345)    txa'nã awe-'he-tjara-re
          we.IN    rain-NEG-PROC-INT
          ‘good that it did not rain!’This construction will be further discussed in (5.5.19.3.1.). More examples
were also given in (4.7.2.).
    Regret or compassion can be expressed through the verb root daki- ‘it’s a
pity’, which is required in the cosubordinative as complement of an interroga-
tive matrix verb:(1346)    da'ki-tja      tsͅi-'re
          pity-CSO       tear-INT
          ‘a pity it (the cloth) tore’The second person interrogative form of the verb root awͿi- ‘see’ may function
as a tag question, not necessarily with its literal sense:181(1347)    ku'kui ywy'nwͿ nͿ-'nwͿ-re           a'wͿi-xa-re
          wow      tree       big-CL:tree-INT see-2-INT
          ‘wow! that’s a big tree, isn’t it?’(1348)    nͿ-nãi-'he-tsy-hͿ-herejã-re      awͿi-'he-xa-re
          big-NOM-NEG-GER-NOM-APPL-INT see-NEG-2-INT
          ‘that is not much money, is it?’Note that in the latter example another lexicalised tag question construction is
used as well. The interrogative form of the appellative conjectural -herejã-
(which contains the existential verb jã- ‘to be’) is often cliticised to nominals in
order to draw the attention of the hearer, or even to express surprise about the
fact that (the hearer is so mal-informed that) it is necessary to mention the in-
formation at all. So there may be an extra connotation of self-evidence of the
facts expressed: ‘isn’t it?, of course!’ or even of irritation about the ignorance
of the hearer: ‘you fool!’. It is possible that -here contains a lexicalised inter-
rogative mood marker (see 5.5.14.).(1349)    'mã-herejã-re              (1350)      kayte-'ce-a-hͿ-herejã-re
          mother-APPL-INT                        scrape-CL:hole-1P-NOM-APPL-INT
          ‘it is mother, you silly!’             ‘(first) we clean it (the mortar) on
                                                 the inside, don’t we?’ (t)Another conjectural morpheme that may involve cleft-like use of the interroga-
tive is deductive apparential -tehere or -cehere (see 5.5.14.2.), which can be
181.This use of the verb awͿixare may be calqued on Portuguese viu? ‘did you see it?’.
300   5. The verb phrasetranslated as ‘think that, it seems that, maybe’. Maybe it consists of the mor-
phemes -te-he-re ‘(-INTENS-NEG-INT)’:(1351)    awe-'nã-tehere
          rain-FUT-APPR
          ‘I think it is going to rain’Finally, there is a focus suffix -rati- (see 7.2.8.) which is often combined with a
question word in an interrogative matrix sentence:(1352)    tsuhǊ-ra'ti-wã hã   'ta-a-re                (1353)     wai-ra'ti-re
          what-FOC-AO water say-1P-INT                           good-FOC-INT
          ‘what does “hã” mean?’                                 ‘is it delicious?’The specific morphemes involved in the emphatic interrogative expressions
will be treated more extensively in the aforementioned sections.","[334, 335, 336, 337, 338]"
"
5.1.7. Impersonal use of the verb root jã- ‘to be’The verb root jã- ‘to be’ is mostly used in special idiomatic and emphatic cleft
constructions (see 7.2.11. and 8.6.3.) such as the one below:(1230)    jere'xwa tͅjãwã-'wy hyhy'rwa-ta dutu're           txe-'hͿ    kahİ-'hͿ
          jaguar dark-time move-CSO pig                     grab-NOM   bite-NOM          ka'hİ-ta jo='bwa-tsy-hͿ               ha'dytİ=hyhyrwa-'hͿ-ki=jã-hͿ
          bite-CSO devour=end-GER-NOM shit=move-NOM-DEC=be-NOM
          ‘the jaguar walks in the dark, grabs wild pigs, bites and eats them,
          and walks while he shits, it is like that’ (t)In some of these constructions, jã- occurs in a position where one would expect
a person cross-reference marker. Note how the following examples, which rep-
resent a possible answer to the question ‘what is this pipe for?’, were claimed
to be identical in meaning:
169.According to the offered POR translation: aquí a gente respira.

          ‘it was for bathing (but                      ‘it was for bathing (but
          now it has broke down)’                       now it has broke down)’In those positions, it often seems to “agree” with first person plural inclusive
-a- in other clauses. Furthermore, in those situations, it is usually translated by
the consultants in Portuguese as a gente, literally ‘the people’ but functionally
an impersonal way in which to say ‘we, us’. This use of jã- is discussed and il-
lustrated further in section (7.2.11.). The following example shows especially

impersonal cross-reference morpheme which is coincidentally homophonous
with jã- ‘to be’. I consider this as less likely in the first place because it doesn’t170.The verb djͅ- ‘kill’ is normally used for the killing of birds, but it’s use here is
    probably children’s speech.
280   5. The verb phraseseem to be necessary to presume the existence of another morpheme. There is
no profound incompatibility of the senses ‘it is’ (of jã- ‘to be’) and ‘one is’ (of
-a- ‘1P’). Furthermore, in most other constructions, such as (1230), jã- is not
easily associated with impersonal reference. Such an interpretation, e.g. as a
quotative, would be probably too far-fetched. As another imaginable hypothe-
sis, -jã- could be regarded as an allomorph of -a-. A problem with this hypothe-
sis is that there seem to be no morphophonological conditions for the occur-
rence of -jã- instead of -a-. Furthermore, if such a condition would exist, such
as spread of nasalisation, it would be impossible to relate this to a functional
property like impersonal.","[316, 317, 318]"

            ‘is (the pepper) strong?’               ‘no’In other contexts, an answer like 'hetse could mean ‘there isn’t (any)’, ‘he said
no’, etc.
   The occurrence of rootless negation combined with further morphemes in
extraposition functions as a particle which emphasises the negative aspect of a
preceding negative sentence:(2808)   Ǌcenãi-'hͿ-he-ki     'he-tsy-hͿ
         know-NOM-NEG-DEC NEG-GER-NOM
         ‘they don’t know anything’   The same countersuppositionality as discussed in section (7.1.1.2.) can be
expressed in root ellipsis:(2809)   xa-'he-tsy-tse      İ-'ra
         2-NEG-POT-DEC go-IMP
         ‘don’t you persist, go away!’ (t)This example is from a mythological story in which a boy, who presumed
wrongly that he could stay with his mother, is sent away.
    The free occurrence of he'ki ‘no’ probably also negates a presupposition, but
the evidence is only circumstantial. In (8.1.2.1.) it is explained how negation is
not normally adjacent to an interrogative mood marker. However, when it is,
countersupposition is apparently involved. The following example suggests
this:(2810)   he-'re
         NEG-INT
         ‘yes, isn’t it?’
530   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresThis example represents an utterance which confirms a statement. Its non-
countersuppositional variant would be the interrogative equivalent of 'hetse ‘it
isn’t’ and it would inquire about the negation of the omitted root.306
   Since the negative morpheme can occur as a verbal root, it is apparently also
found as root part of a compound. Compare the following examples:(2811)    darje-'he-tja      ojanͿ-'he-tse
          strong-NEG-CSO arrive-NEG-DEC
          ‘because he is weak, he did not come hither’(2812)    darje-'he-tja 'he=ojanͿ-ki
          strong-NEG-CSONEG=arrive-DEC
          ‘because he is weak, he did not come hither’It is possible that the verb root he'?ai- ‘to want not’ originates from ellipsis and
compounding:(2813)    wƭ    he'?ai-xa-re
          wine want.not-2-INT
          ‘you don’t want wine?’Although there is no verbal root *ai-, there are roots which may be historically
related, aitse- ‘to be patient’ and aitsehe- ‘to be lazy’.
    There is one other type of expression in which the negative morpheme is
probably used elliptically:(2814)    i'si-da-nãi-'he
          die-1S-NOM-NEG
          ‘(I’m) not (going to drink more) or else I’ll get drunk’(2815)    ka'je=İ-da-nãi-'he
          crawl=go-1S-NOM-NEG
          ‘(I’m) not (going to drink more) or else I’ll have to crawl’This construction is neither semantically nor grammatically understood very
well, and it is probably idiomatic. Example (2814) was considered as identical
to the following:306.This was created by myself:          he-tsy-'re

7.2.8. Focus -rati-When applied to nouns or verb roots, the morpheme -rati- has a focus function.
It occurs often in interrogative clauses, attached to the question word tsǊhǊ
‘what’.(2934)   tsǊhǊ-ra'ti cari-'re           (2935)   tsǊhǊ-ra'ti e=e'hͿ-xa-re

                                      7.2. Morphemes not limited to word class   551-rati- can occur as part of the matrix predicate:(2940)    tsǊhǊ-ra'ti-re
          what-FOC-INT
          ‘what kind of thing is it?’ (reaction to someone’s question about ‘it’)-rati- is not an interrogative morpheme, and it is possible to ask the same ques-
tions without its application. However, it accentuates a certain topic which is,
explicitly or implicitly, at hand. Of the following set of alternatives, to be pos-
sibly uttered when one sees tracks in the sand, the consultant said that the one
without -rati- was ‘less clear’:(2941)    tsǊhǊ-rati-to'ha-re     (2942)     tsǊhǊ-to'ha-re
          what-FOC-foot-INT                  what-foot-INT
          ‘it is the tracks of what?’        ‘what track is it?’ (MA: ‘less clear’)-rati can also be applied to verb roots:(2943)    wai-rati-'re

value. In the following examples, -rati- replaces the mood marker and indicates
surprise and emphasis:(2945)    mo'rango wai-ra'ti-ta'dy

contains historical narrative. This is discussed in the next subsection. It fur-
thermore shows some resemblance to the nominal prioritive morpheme -rata-
discussed in (4.4.7.). Note that -rati- is homophonous with, but considered dis-
tinct from, a classifier that means ‘man’ discussed in (4.2.2.2.).","[588, 589, 590]"

5.5.19.1. Persuasive mood in combination with -tara-The above supersection demonstrates how the state of affairs as expressed by
the verb root can be postponed by procrastinative -tara-. In the present subsec-
tion, it will be shown that -tara- has the opposite effect when combined with
persuasive moods. In this combination procrastination happens on behalf of the
state of affairs expressed by the verb root, while another, implicit state of af-
fairs is postponed.
    With the exhortative mood, discussed in (5.2.4.), -tara- means ‘to do first,
before anything else’ rather than ‘to do later’:(2232)   'ja-a-tara-ni                  (2233)   'ja-a-xa-tara-ni
         eat-1P-PROC-EXH                         eat-1P-AS-PROC-EXH
         ‘let’s (IN) eat first!’                 ‘please, let us (EX) eat first!’(2234)   'ja-tara-ni                    (2235)   'wai-dy-tara-'ja
         eat-PROC-EXH                            good-CAU-PROC-EXP
         ‘let him eat first’                     ‘let’s make the food tasteful!’In order to express ‘let (him) eat later!’, a more analytic construction is used,
which involves a preconditional adverbial clause (see 8.2.1.3.) and a declara-
tive matrix clause containing -tara-:(2236)   'ja-tara-tse      kuriku'ri-tsy-lİ
         eat-PROC-DEC little.later-POT-PREC
         ‘let him eat later’(2237)   kuriku'ri=jã-lİ           'ja-a-tara-tse
         little.later=be-PREC      eat-1P-PROC-DEC
         ‘let’s eat later’  In the following examples, -tara- in combination with the exhortative mood
morpheme -ni is embedded in an elliptic quotation construction (see 5.5.11.):(2238)   bohyja-tara-'ni-xa-he-re
         burn.up-PROC-CAUS-2-NEG-INT
         ‘why don’t you let it burn up? (instead of extinguishing the cigarette
         halfway)’ (lit. ‘don’t you say “let it burn up first!”?’)
438   5. The verb phrase(2239)   be-tara-'ni-xa-he-re

         ‘why don’t you wait for (the fruit) to ripen?’

         ripe-PROC-CAUS-IS-NEG-INT
         ‘why don’t they wait for (the fruit) to ripen?’
         (lit. ‘don’t they say “let it ripen first!”?’)   Also in the imperative, -tara- means ‘to do first’. However, it was shown in
(5.2.3.2.) that it can only be succeeded by a verb-final element -ta, instead of
the expected imperative marker -ra:(2241)   'ja-tara-'ta
         eat-PROC-IMP
         ‘eat first! (before going away)’(2242)   ka'we      oxote-'hͿ-tara-ta          (2243)      here?ece-hͿ-tara-'ta

         ‘wait for the coffee first!’                      ‘rest first!’In order to express ‘eat later!’, a construction similar to (2236) is used, albeit
without -tara-:(2244)   kuriku'ri-xa-lİ      'ja-xa-tsy-tse
         little.later-2-PREC eat-2-POT-DEC
         ‘you (SG) eat later!’It has not been attested whether the matrix clause can be in the canonical im-
perative instead of the present mitigated imperative (as discussed in 5.2.3.1.).
    In section (5.2.5.) it was shown that in combination with -tara- ‘later’ the
volitive -mͿ does not bear the expected first person subject cross-reference
morphemes:(2245)   here?ece-hͿ-tara-'mͿ

          bathe-1S-PROC-VOL
          ‘let me take a bath first’   Although the usual sense of -tara- in the volitive mood is ‘to do first’, with
the verb ja- ‘to eat’, -tara- seems to have both opposite meanings ‘to do later’
and ‘to do first’. In the first sense eating is postponed until later. In the second
sense, eating takes place first, with the implication that something else is post-
poned. It is not entirely predictable which sense is intended:(2250)    ha-ha-nͿ-'tsa-tara-mͿ

5.5.19.2. Interrogative mood in combination with -tara-Procrastinative -tara- was seldom attested in interrogative clauses. In one type
of construction, the resulting sense is ‘to be already’:(2252)    atsi'le-tara-re        (2253) kawİ         'hoi-tara-re

          ‘is it heavy (enough) already?’ ‘is the coffee (quite) sweet already?’In a way, -tara- in these examples may have a modal connotation of ‘fortu-
nately’ as well. The question in (2252) anticipates a positive answer, because
people (both sellers and buyers) generally want blocks of latex to be heavy.","[475, 476, 477]"

                                Introduction
Kwaza is an unclassified indigenous Amazonian language that is spoken by 25
people. The speakers of Kwaza live in the indigenous reserve of Tubarão-
Latundê on the headwaters of the Apediá or Pimenta Bueno river in the South-
east of the federal Brazilian state of Rondônia. In traditional times the Kwaza
must have formed a fierce nation of a few thousand persons subdivided into
various groups. They lived in a huge area, as neighbours of the Aikanã nation
which was of similar size and structure.1 It is not known when exactly the
Kwaza met representatives of Western cultures for the first time.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]"

5.6.3. The first person plural cross-reference morpheme -a-As demonstrated in the previous sections, verbs which are nominalised by -hͿ
or -nãi retain person marking. This person marking may be expressed by overt
cross-reference morphemes or, in case of a third person, by zero-marking.
Cross-reference markers occur in nominalised verbs without any change of
meaning, except for the first person plural. When applied before nominalisation
by -hͿ, -nãi and, possibly, -hͿwã (see 5.6.4.below), the first person plural
marker -a- may get a non-personal sense. Under its occurrence in such in-
stances, the verb is interpreted as if it is not inflected for person at all, be it
overt or covert. In a way, the first person plural marker enables the creation of
an abstract noun.
   When -a- is applied before the nominaliser -hͿ, the result is often something
that resembles an infinitive-like action noun:(2451)    tsu'tsu-hͿ                     (2452)    tsu'tsu-a-hͿ
          urinate-NOM                              urinate-1P-NOM
          ‘the one that urinates’                  ‘urinating, to urinate’
472   5. The verb phrase(2453)   i'si=Ǌi-da-hͿ-ki                 (2454)   i'si=Ǌi-a-hͿ
         die=lie-1S-NOM-DEC                        die=lie-1P-NOM

         heal-again-1P-NOM
         ‘to resuscitate’The application of -a-hͿ results in a noun. The following examples show that
the verbal root of such a noun may retain an argument:(2456)   ko'reja   'kjͅ-a-hͿ
         knife     sharpen-1P-NOM
         ‘file’(2457)   mƭu       wy'ru-a-hͿ               (2458)    atxi'txi dudu'ñǊ-a-hͿ

         ‘mortar’ (lit. ‘thing to grind               ‘mortar’ (lit. ‘thing to
         (maize in for) chicha’)                      pund maize in (for flour)’)(2459)   oitsi-'lİ-a-hͿ           e-tsy-ka'nİ
         copulate-RECI-1P-NOM have-GER-CL:oblong
         ‘pornographic video tape’Nota that in spite of the fact that the above examples involve juxtaposition of
nouns, these nouns only rarely seem to modify one another (see 4.3.):(2460)   hi       ha'bi-a-hͿ
         firewood ignite-1P-NOM
         ‘firewood for ignition’Another example may be (2463) below.
  The abstract noun has often a connotation of ‘with respect to’ or of purpose:(2461)   warja-'ra kui-'dy-a-hͿ
         take-IMP    drink-CAU-1P-NOM
         ‘take something to drink to him!’(2462)   Q: tsǊhǊ-'nãi pİ̘rİ̘'jã-nã-a-re           A: 'mƭu-dy-a-hͿ
            what-NOM speak-FUT-1P-INT                 chicha-CAU-1P-NOM
            ‘what will we talk about?’                ‘about making chicha’ (t)The result of nominalisation with -a- may also resemble an agent noun. Two
possible translations were offered for the word mƭudy?ahͿ in the above exam-
ple: ‘in order to make chicha’ and (although considered less appropriate)
                                                            5.6. Nominalisation     473‘maker of chicha’. This semantic ambiguity can be explained better with the
following example:(2463)    'tauBa a'xy-dy-a-hͿ
          board     house-CAU-1P-NOM
          ‘boards to build a house’266According to the consultant the word axydy?ahͿ can be translated both as ‘in
order to make a house’ and as ‘maker of a house’. This is apparently because of
the fact that the involved boards both serve the builder to make a house and
constitute the house themselves.267 The next example represents an instrument
noun:(2464)    'a-a-hͿ
          exist-1P-NOM
          ‘(once-) inhabited place / house’    In the translations offered by the consultants of the nominalisations dis-
cussed here, -a- seems to behave as sort of infinitive marker meaning some-
thing like ‘(thing) with reference to V-ing’. Literally, however, all occurrences
of -a- can and should be regarded as first person plural cross-reference. In some
of the following examples, I have added a literal translation. The result of -a-hͿ
can be zero-verbalised:(2465)    ou-'dy-a-hͿ-ki
          catch-CAU-1P-NOM-DEC
          ‘it’s to hook up (i.e. a clip)’ (lit. ‘it’s a thing which we hook up with’)(2466)    to'mã=jã-hͿ-le-ki              / to'mã-a-hͿ-le-ki
          bathe=be-NOM-FRUST-DEC            bathe-1P-NOM-FRUST-DEC
          ‘it was for bathing (but now it has broke down)’268
          (lit. ‘it was a thing by which we bathed’)   The nominaliser -hͿ is also a classifier. The next example shows that it can
be replaced by more specific classifiers also when it is preceded by non-
personal -a-:
266.The order 21 is also allowed.
267.Germanic and Romance languages have words that have the form of an agent noun,
    even though they refer to patient, instrument or locative nouns, e.g. English drawer
    ‘box which can be drawn out of a piece of furniture by its handle’, Dutch hanger
    ‘thing which is instrumental in hanging up clothes’, and Spanish comedor ‘dining
    room’.
268.This is an answer to the question ‘what is this pipe for?’.
474   5. The verb phrase(2467)    a'xy ha'je-a-mǊ                   (2468)    mwİ̘jã-a-ro'tİ
          house smear-1P-CL:liquid                    open-1P-CL:door
          ‘paint’ (lit. ‘the liquid                   ‘window (hole)’ (lit. ‘the
          we smear onto the house’)                   hole which we open’)The internal structure of the latter example is possibly partly lexicalised. An
indication for this is the fact that the productive classifier for ‘door’ has an /e/
instead of an /İ/: -rote.
    Instead of classifiers, the non-personally used morpheme -a- can also pre-
cede the nominaliser -nãi. The result looks more like an action noun than does
the combination with -hͿ illustrated above. For the rest, -a- has the same prop-
erties. The next example shows that it functions as a non-personal morpheme
also in combination with -nãi:(2469)    e-'enãi-rjͿ-nãi

construction:(2477)    tsurwani-ka'si-a-hͿ
          nostril-CL:wing-1P-NOM
          ‘nose feather’The literal interpretation of this example is probably: ‘the one that we use as a
nose feather decoration’.
   The subsequent application of a nominaliser suggests that roots or stems
which end in -a- are verbal. On the other hand, only very few possible in-
stances of non-personal -a- were attested which are followed directly by a ver-
bal mood marker:(2478)    ti-'nãi       mã-a-'re
          what-NOM call-1P-INT
          ‘how is this called?’ (lit. ‘how do we call this?’)
5.6.3.1. The ambiguous interpretation of -a-Non-personal use of the first person plural morpheme was also shortly dis-
cussed in (5.1.6.). Because the first person plural form -a- is also used in its ca-
nonical first person plural sense, the consultant offered two different transla-
tions for the following example:(2479)    hyhy'rwa-a-re
          move-..-INT
          ‘are we going to walk?’, ‘will there be walking?’On the basis of the fact that the person marked examples in (2480) below are
interpretable, one would expect potential confusion between non-personal and
first person plural -a-. However, such a first person plural interpretation was
rejected for example (2481):(2480)    erewe-'xy-da-nãi                         erewe-'xy-nãi
          write-CL:leaf-1S-NOM                     write-CL:leaf-NOM
          ‘my writing’                             ‘his writing’(2481)    hary'ky erewe-'xy-a-nãi           'wai-ki
          now      write-CL:leaf-1P-NOM good-DEC
          ‘now (since there is a table), (*our) writing goes well’
476   5. The verb phraseIt probably depends on the context how -a- is to be interpreted. In constructions
like the following the non-personal reading does not seem to be a problem,
whereas a first person plural reading seems somewhat far-fetched:(2482)    wãwã'wͿ-a-nãi        e-da-hͿ-ki
          dream-1P-NOM         have-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘I had a dream’ (lit. ‘I have what we dream’)(2483)    wai-'he-hͿ-'dy-da-ki            cu'cu-a-nãi
          good-NEG-NOM-CAU-1S-DEC walk-1P-NOM
          ‘(the shoe) makes walking uncomfortable’
          (lit. ‘I’m given incommodation in our walking’)Nevertheless, -a- may be ambiguous with respect to both readings in the fol-
lowing examples:(2484)    ͅ'hike    'ta-a-nãi       he'?ai-tse
          Henrique talk-1P-NOM want.not-DEC
          ‘he does not like (people) to call him Henrique’(2485)    cͅrͅ'mǊ 'hedy-a-nãi       'wai-re
          milk       mix-1P-NOM     good-INT
          ‘is it good with milk?’The same ambiguity was found with regard to the morpheme combination
-a-hͿ-wã discussed in (5.6.4.) below.
   Another ambiguity is related to the possibility that -a- can be applied to
nouns:(2486)    kukuri'?yi-a-hͿ
          loop-1P-NOM
          ‘spring’The root of this construction is probably related to the verb kurje- ‘stir, wind’,
and is extended by the classifier -yi- ‘thread, wire’. Literally it could mean ‘the
repeatedly winding one’. Maybe, however, -a- should be interpreted as a- ‘ex-
ist, have’, which would yield the literal sense of ‘one having windings’.(2487)    kukuri'?yi    a-'hͿ
          loop         exist-NOM
          ‘spring’To make matters worse, this alternative analysis is also imaginable for verbal
roots because of the possiblity of verbal compounding. Then example (2452)
could be interpreted alternatively in the following way:
                                                        5.6. Nominalisation   477(2488)   tsu'tsu=a-hͿ
         urinate=exist-NOM
         ‘there being urinating’However, this seems rather unlikely.
   Whatever the value of -a-, it cannot be combined with (other) person cross-
reference marking:(2489)   *erewe-xy-da-a-nãi
         write-CL:leaf-1S-1P-NOM
         ‘my writing’Although the interpretation of the element -a- as a first person inclusive marker
may in certain contexts lead to somewhat far-fetched analyses, I have chosen to
consider it as a first person plural morpheme also in the examples discussed
here.","[509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515]"
"
8.6.2. ExplicativeThe verb root nãi- ‘to be like’/’to do thus’ has an abstract semantic content, and
can be used as a dummy verb in all situations where it is clear from the narra-
tive or pragmatic context what it means:(3738)    'nãi-cwa-ta      'nãi-wa-hͿ-herejã-re
          like-IS-CSO      like-IS-NOM-APPL-INT
          ‘that’s how it happened to him’ (that’s how he fared)Medial clauses often function as a complement of reason in cosubordination
with the matrix clause. If the matrix predicate is based on the verb root nãi- ‘to
be like’/’to do thus’, the construction V-CSO nãi- ‘it is because V’ is used in the
discourse to inform about or to explain the background to a certain situation.
Consider the following little dialogues:(3739)    Q: ti-'nãi-tja     'nãi-re              A: hy'ja-ta 'nãi-ki
             what-NOM-CSO like-INT                   fall-CSO like-DEC
             ‘how did it happen to him?’             ‘he fell, that is how it went’(3740)    Q: tsǊhǊ-'du-xa-ta    kunͿ-'djo-xa-re
             what-BER-2-CSO dress-CL:foot-2-INT
             ‘why are you putting on shoes?’          A: hyhyrwa-'nã-da-ta     'nãi-da-ki
             move-FUT-1S-CSO       like-1S-DEC
             ‘because I’m going for a walk’The verb root can also be the first member of a compound. In that case the sec-
ond member explicitates the background:(3741)    ho'hͿ-xa-ta    nãi=tsasi-'he-xa-re
          shy-2-CSO      like=follow-NEG-2-INT
          ‘you don’t come with us because you are shy?’
8.6.3. IndignantThere are several emphatic constructions which express indignation over the
fact that the hearer is not aware of something. The most important ones involve
the interrogative mood and the verb jã- ‘to be’ and were discussed in
                                                    8.6. Specific constructions   711(5.5.14.3.). The construction discussed here also involves clefting use of jã-.
Furthermore, it may contain emphatic use of the interrogative, a switch refer-
ence construction, an embedded cosubordinative construction, and the verb
nãi- ‘to be like’ often occurs as the matrix predicate root. The entire framework
of this construction can be summarised as:(3742)   V-ta        a-'re=jã-si           'nãi-xa-re
         verb-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
         ‘do you suppose that it is really the case that V?’The verb jãsi ‘it is’ is represented here as cliticised to the preceding one be-
cause of the stress pattern. Main stress is on the preceding interrogative marker.
Note that in this construction the preceding verb a're ‘is there?’ is usually pro-
nounced as [ã'4Ӂ] or [Ó'4Ӂ], probably because of the nasality of the subsequent
verb root jã-.
   This construction expresses indignation over a presupposition held by the
hearer. Consider the following examples:(3743)   'mİ̘-ta a-'re=jã-si           'nãi-xa-re
         hit-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
         ‘he did not hit me, no!’ (S does not want to admit it)
         (lit. ‘do you perhaps suppose that he hit me?’)(3744)   tsuhǊ-'du-xa-ta      oja'nͿ-xa-re     mã
         what-BER-2-CSO       come-2-INT       mother         awͿi=ba'ru=asa-hata-tsy-hͿ-ta   a-'re=jã-si
         see=end=leave-3S.2O-POT-NOM-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR         'nãi-xa-re=tja      'ta-ta    'İ-ra=tja       'ta-hͿ=wara
         like-2-INT=CSO      talk-CSO go-IMP=CSO       talk-NOM=but
         ‘“why the hell have you come?, mother is not just going to have a
         look at you, no!”, she said, “go away!” she said, but...’ (t)The latter example is from a traditional tale in which a young boy is searching
his mother, but his grandmother warns him, because the mother is likely to kill
the boy upon first sight. Through this construction she emphatically rejects the
boy’s presupposition that the mother will also want to see him.
   Not all ingredients of the framework as represented in (3742) are obligatory.
Consider the following examples in which there is no matrix predicate:(3745)   'kawİ         'kui-tsy-hͿ-'ta       a-'re=jã-si
         coffee drink-POT-NOM-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR
         ‘he isn’t going to drink coffee, no!’
         (lit. ‘it is to be questioned that he is going to drink coffee’)
712    8. Subordination and coordination(3746)    'kawİ    'kui-da-tsy-hͿ-'ta        a-'re=jã-si
          coffee drink-1S-POT-NOM-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR
          ‘I (know I’m) not going to drink coffee!’(3747)    waja-ha'ta-tsy-hͿ-'ta         a-'re=jã-si
          bring-3S.2O-POT-NOM-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR
          ‘he is not going take you there, no (it’s a pity)’Also the cosubordinative construction may be left out:(3748)    a-'re=jã-si
          exist-INT=be-SWR
          ‘I don’t know whether there is (any food etc.)’(3749)    kukui-'dy-da-rai-re=jã-si               'nãi-xa-re
          hurt-BEN-1S-damn-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
          ‘it doesn’t hurt, no!’416 (lit. ‘do you perhaps suppose that it hurts?’)(3750)    atsi'le-ki      jã-he-rai-'re      jã-'si   'nãi-xa-re
          heavy-DEC be-NEG-damn-INT be-SWR like-2-INT
          ‘it is very heavy, I’m telling you!’
          (lit. ‘it is heavy: do you perhaps suppose that it bloody isn’t?’)In these constructions, the interrogative marker is used emphatically, and the
negative connotation is not marked overtly in the morphology. In a way, the
interrogative marker expresses strong negation, and the literal translation of
(3745) is not entirely realistic. Although these constructions may have a nega-
tive value, no negative morpheme is involved unless the element -si should be
related to negative -hͿsi (see 7.1.3.), and should not represent a switch-
reference marker. However, there is no formal reason to assume that there is
morphologically marked negation here:(3751)    ti-'nãi-da-lİ         axe'hͿ-da-tsy-re jã-si     'nãi-xa-re
          what-NOM-1S-PREC meet-1S-POT-INT be-SWR like-2-INT
          ‘well how would I meet her, do you suppose?’ (t)
          (lit. ‘how do you suppose I could meet her?’)The following example indicates that the presumed switch reference marker
does not have to be present at all:
416.One does not normally want to admit it if one is in pain.
                                                    8.6. Specific constructions   713(3752)    tsuhǊ-ra'ti mani'ni ja-da-'re=jã-hͿ

          ‘I don’t know what fish I’ve eaten’
          (lit. ‘it being a question what fish I’ve eaten’)Finally, it appears that the root jã- is not necessarily cliticised to an interroga-
tive structure:(3753)    tsuhǊ-'du-xa-lİ nãi-xa-'he-tsy-tse 'xyi-dy-hͿ

          after you, you fool!, why would you?, what for would you do that?”
          she said’ (t)In this example, which is from the same text as (3744), the grandmother is try-
ing to convince her daughter of not killing her own son. She tries to work on
the daughter’s consciousness by emphasising the fact that the boy is her son
and that he has searched for her in spite of the danger.
    I see any negative interpretation of variants of the indignant construction as
a side-effect of the interrogative clause to which jã- is attached. In these exam-
ples, which all involve indignation or categorical negation, the only obligatory
element is the root jã-.

                     Lexico-semantic categories
This section contains certain specific topics concerning the lexicon of Kwaza,
such as a special register of children’s talk, and lexico-semantic categories such
as colour terms, shape terms, kinship terminology, proper names of people,
dogs and rivers. The last subsection deals with ideophones.","[748, 749, 750, 751, 752, 753]"
"
3.1.   Parts of speechTrying to decide upon the question of what should be regarded as a “word” in
Kwaza, I have in the present work used a combination of phonological and
grammatical criteria. If an element may contain a stressed syllable and can oc-
cur in different positions in an utterance, I regard it as a word.
    In general, main word stress tends to fall on the last syllable of the root. A
number of roots appear to coincide with monomorphemic stems which can oc-
cur as syntactically free elements in the clause. Another group of roots require
attachment of other elements before they can be syntactically free.
    As it happens, this division between different kinds of roots can provide the
basis for a distinction between parts of speech in Kwaza. The coincidence of
certain formal and functional properties of free elements in Kwaza justifies a
major distinction of the grammatical categories of nouns, adverbs and particles
as opposed to verbs.
92    3. Parts of speech and constituent order   There is no justification for adjectives, articles and adpositions as separate
categories.","[129, 130]"
"
220.Order 132 is also allowed, but 213 is less felicitous.
358   5. The verb phrase    In her article, Wise (2002) shows that a number of unrelated Peruvian Ama-
zonian languages, such as Arabela and Iquito (Zaparo), Chayahuita (Ca-
huapana) and Yagua (Peba-Yagua) share applicative suffixes of the form
-ta/-tia. She asks the question whether this could be a North-Western Amazo-
nian areal feature. However, in addition to Kwaza, also other languages in
South-Western Amazonia seem to have similar morphemes, such as the Aikanã
(unclassified) “transitiviser/classifier” -za- (Vasconcelos 2002), the Kanoê (un-
classified) “transitiviser/classifier” -ta-/-to- (Bacelar 2004), the Karo (Tupi-
Ramarama) comitative/causative -ta- (Gabas 1999:83-86), the Moséten (un-
classified) applicative -tya-/-te- (Sakel 2003:251-253) and possibly others.","[395, 396]"

7.7.8. Delay jale ‘wait!’The particle jale ‘wait (a little)!’ indicates that the speaker requires something
to be delayed or postponed for a short while. The particle may occur in isola-
tion:(3205)    ja'le
          wait
          ‘wait!, wait a little’In the following example, it is part of a quotative construction:(3206)    ja'le-da-ki
          wait-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m saying ‘wait a little!’’It occurs often in a negative imperative combination with the verb root ihƭ- ‘on
the contrary’, which was discussed in (5.2.7.) and (7.1.2.):(3207)    ja'le=ihƭ-ky
          wait=contrary-NEI

7.7.9. Exhortation hӻdİ ‘let's go!’The exhortative particle hͿdİ was also presented in (5.2.4.3.). The stress on the
last syllable is sometimes so heavy, that the first syllable becomes reduced to
nothing: [Èe]. This was the case in the following example (although it is written
in its full form here):(3211)    hͿ'dİ      jã-Ϳ-'rjͿ            kari'cwa-na    'İ-a-ta

wife or husband. An identical particle is used in Aikanã.ӻ ‘uhh’. The element Ϳ can also be used in the hesitation sense of ‘uhh’.hӻ ‘uhh’. The element hͿ is sometimes uttered as a minimal response when one
has not understood the previous speaker:(3213)    Q:    xyi ece-nͿ-ku'ty-xa-hͿ-re                          A:      hͿ

                ‘do you put oil in your hair?’                             ‘uhh?’hãhã ‘it is’. The element hãhã ‘it is’ is used as a minimal response by the hear-
ers when someone tells a story. It is not felicitous to use hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes’ in this way.
604   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresha?ã ‘here!’. The element ha?ã is used when one presents something to some-
one:(3214)    ha'?ã     u'ru
          here!     patua
          ‘look, here are patua seeds!’hӻ?ӻ ‘yes, O.K.’. As a positive minimal response, hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes, O.K.’ is used.
The second syllable bears the accent. It can also be pronounced as hã'?ã, hã'hã,
hy'?Ϳ, “hmhm” or Ϳ'hͿ. It is also a positive minimal response to commands.
Roquette-Pinto (1950:152) attributes the wide diffusion of “Hum! Hum!” in
this function among Brazilians, esp. in Mato-Grosso and Rondônia, to Indian
influence.tse ‘yes’. Another positive minimal response is tse ‘yes’, sometimes pro-
nounced as [se]. It is used much in family II. It is not to be confused with the
interjection tsİh ‘why!’ or the declarative morpheme -tse.","[640, 641, 642]"

have only a passive knowledge of Aikanã. Some are bilingual in Kwaza and
Portuguese. This family claims Kwaza ethnic identity and is very reserved to-
wards the Aikanã and anyone else, including the other Kwaza speaking family.

indigenous languages, except for the head of the Latundê group, who, being of
Tawandê (Northern Nambikwara) upbringing still speaks his mother tongue.
     Within family I, Kwaza is used mainly between representatives of the pe-
nultimate and antepenultimate generation. Within family II, Kwaza is the vehi-
cle of verbal communication for all generations. Furthermore, Kwaza is the
language of communication between the two families. However, because of the
little contact between these families, they cannot really be considered to con-
stitute a “speech community”. Hence, Kwaza can be said to be a family lan-
guage of two separate families. As far as I can estimate, both families I and II
have been speaking Kwaza as a first language under these circumstances
maybe for some 30 years, and at the most four generations were involved.
     Half of Maria Edite’s family lives in Gleba. Another part of the Kwaza
speakers live in the different settlements of Barroso. Recently, members of
family II have been moving to the town of Chupinguaia. Only one Kwaza
semi-speaker, Kwa'ba, or Marlene, who is related to family II, lives with her
Portuguese and Aikanã speaking Aikanã-Kwaza family in the original region
by the São Pedro river. There may be a few Kwaza in the town of Pimenta
Bueno and in Porto Velho but it is not very likely that they still speak the lan-
guage. It may not be excluded that there are still Kwaza living in the remaining
forests avoiding all contact.
     In spite of the fact that Kwaza looks quite seriously endangered with respect
to the number of speakers, it is not endangered with respect to the range of dif-
ferent generations of speakers. In Antonhão’s family, it is acquired as a native
first language by all children, some of whom are very young. In Maria Edite’s
family it is more endangered because only half of the youngest generation
learns to speak it as their “grandmother’s tongue”. Also, with respect to figures
from 20 years ago (±1984) indicating that there were no more than fourteen
speakers at that time (Carlson noted seven), the number of speakers is slowly
increasing: there are 25 speakers today. This is probably due to childbirth and
improved health conditions during the past decennium. Nevertheless, it will be
hard for the language to be transferred to future generations because the mem-
bers of family I and II do not intermarry. Furthermore, a part of family II has
now moved to the nearby town of Chupinguaia, where the Kwaza children will
not get education in their native language.
                                     1.7. Fieldwork situation and methodology    151.7.   Fieldwork situation and methodologyDue to the previous lack of linguistic data, the present work is based almost
entirely on linguistic fieldwork with native consultants. Since practically all
speakers of Kwaza live in the indigenous reserve Tubarão-Latundê, my field-
work involved the acquisition of authorisations by the FUNAI to enter the re-
serve. Since scientific research was the objective, permission had furthermore
to be obtained from the Brazilian national research council CNPq29. One of the
prerequisites for this permission is affiliation with a scientific institution in
Brazil, which was in my case the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi in Belém.
Between February 1995 and March 1998 I spent a total of 14 months in the re-
serve, accompanied by my girlfriend Marga van der Schaaf. We were there
three times, from February to May 1995, November 1995 to July 1996 and No-
vember 1997 to March 1998. In May 1996, my main consultant Mario and I
visited the recently contacted AkǊtsǊ and Kanoê in the Omeré region. In July
1996, Marga and I visited the Kwaza in the São Pedro region. In the second
half of March 1998 Mario was invited to Belém by Denny Moore, to make
digital audio and video recordings at the linguistics department of the Museu
Goeldi.
    In 2001 and 2002 I did fieldwork on another indigenous language of
Rondônia, Arikapu (Yabuti family), but I had the opportunity to visit the
Kwaza again and work with them on a language primer and a revision of my
previous work.
    In the field, I made analogue recordings on audiotape of running texts and
of several elicitation sessions. Most elicitation, however, was only recorded on
paper. One text was also recorded on videotape. Besides Kwaza, I have also
collected some documentation of Aikanã, AkǊtsǊ, Kanoê, Latundê and
Salamãi. Furthermore traditional Kwaza songs and Aikanã music were re-
corded. Finally, many photographs and slides were taken. Since the speech
community of Kwaza is so small and fragmented, one rarely has the chance of
overhearing conversations in the language, let alone that one can become im-
mersed in spoken Kwaza on a day to day basis and learn the language. There-
fore, I never acquired any level of proficiency in Kwaza to boast of, and most
of the fieldwork had to take place via Portuguese, a language in which my main
consultant is much more articulate than I am.
    Fieldwork manuals (e.g. Samarin 1967) always caution the researcher to
choose consultants carefully. In my case, there was no choice, since the com-
munity had decided that I should work with Mario, who had volunteered to be
my consultant. This was only fortunate since he turned out to be an excellent
teacher and a very considerate friend. Although I also did fieldwork with other
speakers of Kwaza, we lived mainly with Mario and his family in Barroso. An-
other important warning in fieldwork manuals and from experienced field29. Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, ‘national council
    of scientific and technological development’.
16     1. Introductionworkers is that the linguistic data should be processed right away in the field.
This was hardly possible in my case because of the attention we got from the
many children and the way we were involved in community life.
    The different sessions in the field consisted of formal elicitation of word
lists and minimal pairs. These were recorded on tape for phonological docu-
mentation and analysis. Furthermore, I asked for translations into Kwaza of se-
ries of Portuguese sentences which I had based on Comrie and Smith’s (1977)
and Dahl’s (1985) questionnaires, and on the three volumes edited by Shopen
(1985). Already in the first weeks in the field some texts in Kwaza were re-
corded and transcribed and an attempt was made to gloss the texts with the help
of the consultant. Later, as Mario became more accustomed to my questions
and as my understanding of the language advanced, morpheme-by-morpheme
translation became less laborious and the analyses became more dependable.
Part II of the present work contains a number of glossed and translated texts, of
several different types. Outside of the fieldwork sessions, I learnt much about
the language by accompanying Mario and others on hunting and fishing trips
and work in the forest. Such occasions were ideal for collecting specific termi-
nology relating to the local flora and fauna, both in Kwaza and in Aikanã.
Many hours of linguistic sessions were devoted to verification and correction
of the data from previous sessions. Besides linguistic interviews with speakers
of Kwaza, I spoke with elderly people whenever I had a chance. Not only is the
Kwaza language undocumented and endangered, but also the traditional culture
and history of the entire region.30
    My teacher Mario belongs to family I. As depicted above in (1.6.), the ecol-
ogy of the Kwaza language in family I has been adversely affected by the low
number of speakers as far as the domain of its use is concerned. Furthermore,
there are some differences between the language as spoken in family I and in
family II. It may be that some differences have a dialectal basis, but on several
occasions there were also indications for a difference in linguistic knowledge.
This became apparent in the knowledge of specialised vocabulary such as kin-
ship terminology.31 On several occasions, members of the different families
said that the other family speaks “different”. Mario once said that family II
members speak in an “old-fashioned” way. Sometimes, members of family II
even claimed to speak “better” themselves. This was not confirmed by the
members of family I, but with questions regarding specific lexical items, Mario
sometimes referred me to Antonhão, the oldest member of family II. He also
told me that he himself had learnt words and expressions from Antonhão which
his mother Maria Edite did not know. Circumstances like these might constitute
a ground to prefer consultants from family II over those from family I. How-
ever, I did not, for several reasons: the first reason being that I had no choice.
In order to conduct fieldwork of reasonable quality I would probably have had
to move and live with family II, which was impossible if I also wanted to30. What the old people have to tell requires more research and merits a separate study.
31. This situation is discussed further in section (9.4.).
                                     1.7. Fieldwork situation and methodology    17maintain good relationships with the rest of the reserve. Furthermore, the
members of family II were rather reserved towards other people. I visited fam-
ily II often and although we became good friends, and I learnt a lot from them
about Kwaza, they always remained very shy and insecure as linguistic con-
sultants. Finally, my impression on the whole is that the grammar of the lan-
guage is identical in both families. Phonological differences, which may be of
dialectal nature, were documented in several recorded texts and wordlists.
    In the reserve there is no electricity but I did not have the time to select and
test solar energy equipment for computers or video cameras. I was relatively
lightly equipped with a professional stereo walkman tape recorder Sony WM
D3 with a stereo lapel microphone Sony ECM 144. This was kept in an airtight
bag with reheatable colour-indicator silica gel at all times except when in use. I
used TDK CrO2 cassette tapes I had brought from the Netherlands and AA size
batteries bought in Vilhena. In case the professional walkman broke down, I
had two spare Sony dictaphone type walkmans, which were much cheaper. I
used these also in transcription work. During my more recent visits I have used
a portable minidisc recorder Sony MZ-R70, with a hand held omni-directional
Sennheiser MD 22 microphone.
    While I was conducting fieldwork, Marga set up a literacy project in Bar-
roso. The necessity of this was obvious, since the closest and only operating
school was in Gleba, which was only attended by five children. Barroso had
more than 15 children but no teacher wanted to live there and the responsible
municipality was not willing to invest in these children. Of course, in view of
the present pace of acculturation one must reckon with a much higher degree of
dependency on the towns a few years from now. Fifteen years ago few people
spoke Portuguese, whereas today even the youngest children speak it as a sec-
ond language. Therefore it is sad that most people in Barroso are illiterate and
are not able to count, let alone that they would be able to do basic mathematic
operations. Consequently, in the future they will become even more dependent
on the good intentions of the Brazilians whereas the experiences leave no room
for much optimism in this respect so far. The alphabetisation project functioned
about five months in total, during which several children acquired basic reading
and writing skills. Had there been more time Marga would also have been able
to reach the Latundê children and I might have managed to teach Antonhão’s
family to write Kwaza.
    Because we were not able to hunt, and there was no time to make a clearing
and till it, we were dependent for our supplies on one- or two-monthly trips to
the supermarket in Vilhena. In Vilhena we became friends with Hans Kompier,
a Dutch immigrant with an “all-Brazilian” family who had been running a dairy
farm in Vilhena and at Perobal on the RO-399, nearby Veado Preto, for over 20
years. His untimely death in May 1999 is a tragic loss to many people in the
region. Whenever we were in Vilhena, we visited him. As we were focusing
almost all our attention on the life of the Indians and had very little time for
Brazilian life we would never have learnt so much about Brazil and the Brazil-
ians without him and his family. I always left the photocopies of my A4 size
18     1. Introductionnote books with him, since I could not afford to lose them. In Vilhena I also
developed my films because photos served as excellent presents for the Indians.
   As regards payment of consultants, there was little else I could think of to
offer but money. Basing myself on considerations like e.g. the salary of the
schoolteacher I chose to pay averagely R$ 3,5 an hour, which corresponded to
a salary of around three Brazilian minimum wages. On several occasions I
could pay in kind, such as clothing and once a horse. In general, when people
on the reserve needed medical assistance or asked for presents or food, we were
never reluctant. Certain people would sometimes ask for a small loan, which I
would usually give. Sometimes I would be asked for a contribution to repara-
tions or petrol for the car.
   A more elaborated account of the setting and the period of fieldwork be-
tween 1995 and 1996 is to be found in van der Voort (1996a). Besides field-
work in Rondônia, (archival) research was done in Belém in December 1994,
in Cuiabá and Rio de Janeiro in October 1995, and in Belo Horizonte and
Brasília in July 1996. During the remaining intervals I lived in the Netherlands,
digitising and studying the Kwaza data. Copies of all tape recordings have been
deposited at the Museu Goeldi in Belém.32
1.8.   The speakers of KwazaSeveral speakers of Kwaza were mentioned in the previous subsections. In the
following, I will present them all briefly, in separate subsections according to
the respective families. Within each subsection, I will first discuss those per-
sons with whom I did substantial fieldwork. Thereafter, I will list the other
speakers, from the oldest to the youngest. In the last subsection, other known
former speakers of Kwaza are briefly mentioned for the sake of completeness.","[51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]"

5.5.14.2. Deductive conjecture: apparential -tehere and -cehereThe apparential morpheme -tehere occurs verb-finally. It expresses more often
the sense of conjecture or assumption than the embedded variant -here- does.
Besides this, it may also express a suspicion, an indirect question or an opinion
on behalf of the speaker.
   The general function of -tehere seems to be deductive evidentiality. Com-
pare the following examples:

          father hungry-2-CSO like-2-NOM-APPR
          ‘father, I think you are hungry’ (t)   From the translations, it is not very clear whether -tehere represents an im-
personal statement, or whether it has a first person connotation in Kwaza. Some
examples were translated both ways:(2139)    ka'tay kukui'hͿ-tehere
          agouti ill-APPR
          ‘I think João is ill / would João be ill?’251   The next example, which represents a quotation construction (see 5.5.11.),
contains explicit reference to the conjecturing first person:(2140)    jere'xwa-(*wã) / wa'wͿi-xay-nãi         he'?ai-xa-tehe're-da-ki
          jaguar-AO       / sleep-2-NOM           want.not-2-APPR-1S-DEC
          ‘I think you don’t want a dog / to sleep / etc.’The alternative second translation of the following elliptic example suggests
that the person and mood markers succeeding -tehere also resulted from a
quotation construction:251.katay ‘agouti’ is a nickname.
                                                 5.5. Tense, modality and aspect   423(2141)    tehe're-da-ta     'nãi-da-ki
          APPR-1S-CSO       like-1S-DEC
          ‘I think like this’, ‘I think yes’The next example is a quotation construction in which a first person is implicit.
It means literally: ‘hei thinks: “hej seems to be afraid”‘ and “hej” is identical
with the speaker in the actual discourse context:(2142)    we-tehe're-tse
          fear-APPR-DEC
          ‘he thinks I am afraid’Note also the following example:(2143)    kukui'hͿ-da-tehe're-tse
          ill-1S-APPR-DEC
          ‘he thinks he is ill’ (even when he isn’t ill)The examples (2140), (2141), (2142) and (2143) obviously represent quotation
constructions. Hence, it is likely that, in those instances where no person cross-
reference marking follows -tehere, it represents an impersonal deduction ‘it
seems’. Where it is translated as ‘I think’ or ‘I wonder’, this is just because the
speaker, who utters the deduction, is always a first person. Thus, it does not
represent the grammatical perspective of Kwaza, and the choice between the
translations ‘it seems’ and ‘I think’ depends on coincidence.
   Another alternative variant of the apparential morpheme is -cehere. It seems
equivalent to -tehere in all respects:(2144)    maga'riDa onİ-'he-cehere
          Margarida come-NEG-APPR
          ‘maybe Margarida did not arrive’252(2145)    'ja       ãwͿi-xa-'hͿ-cehere         (2146)   kreBa-'na oja-'nã-cehere

          ‘maybe someone is bathing that bird, that it is crying like that’ (t)The following little dialogue shows that cehere may function as an equivalent
of -tehere:

                ‘would it be Vera?’                 ‘must be’It is possible that the locative case may precede -tehere, but this cannot be
firmly established because of the want of comparative data:(2149)   'txarwa 'posto-na-cehere
         first    Posto-LOC-APPR
         ‘he could be in Posto now / he must be in Posto now’It seems that the negative may not be immediately adjacent to -tehere:(2150)   kukuihͿ-'he-cehere

         ‘I think no-one screamed’                  ‘I think someone screamed’These examples suggest that -cehere is only partially an optional morphopho-
nological variant of -tehere.
    The morpheme -tehere also plays a role in ‘(n)either ... (n)or’ constructions
involving the particle hele, which are discussed in (7.7.3.).
    The following examples indicate that the apparential morpheme -tehere can
also occur in an emphatic cleft construction involving the auxiliary verb root

7.5.2. Ellipsis of rootsThe omission of verb roots is much more common than omission of verb in-
flexion. Because this makes utterances rather unspecific literally, their inter-
pretation depends heavily on the speech context. Consequently, root ellipsis
occurs frequently in dialogues, as a minimal response to questions, remarks or

5.5.14.3. Appellative -herejã-In a compound structure with the verb root jã- ‘to be’ (see 7.2.11.), and without
a “conjectural” subject, -here- has an appellative and possibly even expletive
function. In the present work I treat -herejã- as one morpheme:(2156)     di'lİ di'lİ mãrİ̘ri'tsa 'bu=Ǌ-rjͿ-herejã-ki
           who who person             put=be-CD:area-APPL-DEC
           ‘who (the hell) is that person sitting there?’ (t)The morpheme can be followed by an interrogative mood marker with the same
emphatic effect (see also 5.2.2.1.):(2157)     'mã-herejã-re
           mother-APPL-INT
           ‘it is mother, didn’t you notice (you fool)!’   Nasalisation does not spread in -herejã-. Even though the Western ear easily
hears [he'4ӁjѸã], such a pronunciation is immediately rejected. Only if one
makes the effort to say [he'rejã] is it accepted by the speakers of Kwaza.
   In procedural texts, such as about how to make chicha, -herejã- occurs fre-
quently and functions as an evidential tag question with the meaning ‘isn’t it?’:(2158)     kayte='te-a-hͿ-herejã-re
           scrape=RED-1P-NOM-APPL-INT
           ‘we clean it (the mortar) on the inside, don’t we’ (t)It may be followed by an explicit tag question:(2159)     nͿ-nãi-'he-tsy-hͿ-herejã-re            awͿi-'he-xa-re
           big-NOM-NEG-GER-NOM-APPL-INT           see-NEG-2-INT
           ‘this is not much (money), now is it?’253.Note that the function of -dy- and -ta- in this example is not well understood.
426   5. The verb phraseThe appellative may have an edifying tone. The ostensibly counterintuitive re-
sult is that a very affirmative statement is phrased as a question:(2160)   cu'ku-herejã-re
         tongue-APPL-INT
         ‘(it is called the) tongue’The appellative -herejã- can be used to express irritation or indignation at
someone “who should know”:(2161)   a=a'nǊ-herejã-re        ('rai?ͿhͿ)
         RED=plant-APPL-INT thing
         ‘he is planting (things), don’t you see?’(2162)   Q: ti-'rjͿ-re          koreja'ro        A: 'jã-Ϳ-hͿ-herejã-re
            what-CD:area-INT pan                    DIST-this-NOM-APPL-INT
            ‘where is the pan?’                     ‘it is there, don’t you see?’(2163)   wady-nƭ'nã-da-hͿ-herejã-re
         give-2O-1S-NOM-APPL-INT
         ‘I’ve already given it to you!’Note about the following example, which concerns an order which has not been
obeyed, that the order itself is embedded as a quoted utterance on a deeper
level:(2164)   tsoroi=oja-'ra-da-hͿ-herejã-re
         run=go-IMP-1S-NOM-APPL-INT
         ‘I asked you to run from there!’ (t)The appellative may furthermore express a complaint, such as about someone’s
drinking:(2165)   'kui-herejã-hͿ
         drink-APPL-NOM
         ‘I think he was drinking, wasn’t he?’Or it is used to express irritation at someone who is nagging. The following ex-
ample was given in a context where the hearer has tried to tease the speaker
about (the latter) not drinking enough chicha:(2166)   'kui-da-herejã-re
         drink-1S-APPL-INT
         ‘am I drinking, or what!’
                                                5.5. Tense, modality and aspect   427However, irritation is often faked:(2167)    Q: wãnͿ'dy 'a-xa-re                   A: a-he'rejã-ki
             food        exist-2-INT               exist-APPL-DEC
             ‘do you have food?’                   ‘of course there is!
             (lit. ‘is there food with you?’)      (otherwise I wouldn’t offer)’(2168)    'kui-xa-hͿ-herejã-re
          drink-2-NOM-APPL-INT
          ‘of course you may drink!’The appellative is also used in contexts where one tries to fool someone. The
next example was given in a context where the speaker tried to make the hearer
believe that he was drinking, whereas in reality the drink was thrown away:(2169)    'kui-da-hͿ-herejã-re
          drink-1S-NOM-APPL-INT
          ‘don’t you see that I’m drinking?’
5.5.15.   Degrammaticalisation of mood inflexion to modal derivationIt seems that the gerundial -tsy-, volitional -damͿ- and causational -nƭ- mor-
phemes are the result of one and the same process. Because of the descriptive
aims of the present work, I have tried to avoid the more theoretical subject of
distinction between inflexional and derivational morphology. At this point,
however, the distinction may be useful in trying to describe the nature of cer-
tain parallel and interrelated characteristics of Kwaza morphology.
    The morphological complex of bound person and mood marking sometimes
occurs as a clitic morpheme or even as a free morpheme. In section (5.5.11.) it
is shown that cliticisation of person and mood marking to predicates which are
already inflected for person and mood is a productive means to quote speech. It
seems on a more diachronic level that, as a result of this same phenomenon of
post-cliticisation of further person and mood suffixes, the volitive (-mͿ), ex-
hortative (-ni), monitory (-tsi) and declarative (-tse) mood morphemes have de-
veloped into modal volitional (-damͿ-), causational (-nƭ-), preventive (-tsi-) and
gerundial (-tsy-) morphemes, respectively. The causational and gerundial do
not contain person cross-reference. In the case of the volitional, however, the
element -da- is still recognisable as the first person singular cross-reference
morpheme, be it not any longer productive.
    Kwaza person and mood suffixes are obligatory and they probably have to
be considered as inflexions, whereas the temporal, modal and aspectual suf-
fixes discussed in the present section represent optional categories and are thus
derivational. In a way then, in Kwaza, certain elements of inflexional morphol-
ogy develop into derivational morphology. To a certain extent, this coincides
428   5. The verb phrasewith Bybee’s (1985:165-189) observations about the development of modality.
However, the fact that the volitive mood develops even further, into a lexical
verbal root, is in contradiction with Bybee.
    In contrast to the three modality morphemes discussed here, the Kwaza pur-
posive -te-, desiderative -heta- and the conjectural element -here- have not, as
far as could be ascertained, developed out of identifiable mood markers. How-
ever, as demonstrated in the relevant subsections, it does occur with obligatory
productive person cross-reference marking, and the structure of the derived and
inflected verb strongly resembles the quotation construction.
    Probably, the development of certain modality morphemes in Kwaza can be
regarded as a result of degrammaticalisation, a process which has been dis-
cussed by Norde (1997, 2001) in her case study about the Swedish genitive.
The inflexionability of certain modality morphemes, such as purposive -te-,
seems to underscore the gradualness of this process. However, this is not
proven since these morphemes are etymologically unanalysable.254
    In van der Voort (2002a) I discuss the possibility that the present analysis of
these phenomena depends on the overall analysis of Kwaza as a morphologi-
cally complex language, and I show, for example, that similar phenomena can
be attested in the highly polysynthetic Eskimo languages.255
5.5.16.   Irrealis -rydy-Because of its main function in conditional adverbial clause constructions, the
irrealis condition morpheme -rydy- is discussed in section (8.2.1.2.) of the
chapter on complex constructions. The following examples show that it can
also be used in a simple matrix clause:(2170)    'ti-nãi      etay-tja'te-rydy-re
          what-NOM woman-3.POS-IRR-INT
          ‘would it be that she was his wife?’(2171)    alexunwͿ-rydy-'hͿ-he-ki
          tree-IRR-NOM-NEG-DEC
          ‘they said it is axe-handle wood but it isn’t’
254.Note that other etymologically unanalysable modality morphemes, such as irrealis
    -rydy-, are not even inflexionable for person at all.
255.The origin of Kwaza modality morphemes resembles the development of local case
    markers of Greenlandic into derivational morphemes, which are placed deeper inside
    the word, and other processes attested in Eskimo (e.g. Fortescue 1984:78;227;321-
    322, De Reuse 1994:170-230, Sadock 1991:174-175). Something similar was docu-
    mented for Ecuadorian Quechua in Muysken (1977:105-107).

general lack of involvement by the speaker. It may have a past connotation. It

tions.","[463, 464, 465, 466, 467]"

4.5.1. Cardinal numeralsThe Kwaza numerals are of heterogenous nature and do not constitute a com-
plete grammaticalised system. There seem to be only two original numeral lex-
emes involved in the cardinal numeral system. These are the roots tei- and aky-,
which relate to the numbers ‘one’ and ‘two’ respectively. They were also men-
tioned in (4.3.2.2.). The present numeral system seems to be quinary, which
suggests a relationship with the fingers of the hand. Nevertheless, there are no
names for the fingers of the hand and no-one could confirm any relation be-
tween the numerals and possible obsolete finger names. The word for ‘finger’
is tsoje'xu, lit. ‘hand-bone’. The principal five roots involved in counting are:(880) 1   tei-                 ‘to be one’, ‘alone’
      2   aky-                 ‘to be two’, ‘company’
      3   e'mã                 ‘one more / again’, ‘without companion’
      4   ele'le (~[İlİ'lİ])   ‘several / many / very / emphatic’
      5   bwa-                 ‘to end / to finish’The roots tei- ‘one’ and aky- ‘two’ are bound roots. This means that they can-
not be used as independent morphemes, nor can they be ‘zero-verbalised’: *tei,
*tei-ki, *tei-tse, *aky, *aky-ki, *aky-tse. Zero-verbalisation is possible, how-
ever, when a classifier or an “adverbialising” morpheme intervenes. The root
tei- ‘one’ is usually attested with the nominaliser -hͿ, and only once with a spe-
cific classifier (see example (815) in 4.4.5.). By contrast, aky- is very often at-
tested to occur with other classifiers as well (see also 4.2.):
                                                                  4.5. Numerals   215(881) aky-'hͿ       ã'wͿi-da-ki e'?Ǌ            (882) aky-lo'tswa-tse

      canoe     two-CL:leg three very-DEC
      ‘the car has four wheels’ (lit. ‘it is a four-wheel car’)Another property unique to aky- ‘two’ is the possibility to distinguish explicitly
animate referents. Instead of -hͿ, the ‘animate’ suffix -ta occurs:(885) tã'jã aky-'ta
      chief two-ANI
      ‘two chiefs’The animacy suffix -ta was only attested with aky- and never with any other
root. Because of such a limited distribution, this morpheme is probably not a
classifier.
   The roots e'mã ‘one more’ and ele'le ‘very’, ‘EMPH’ are independent mor-
phemes in the sense that they do not require further derivation or inflexion. In
the present work they are analysed as adverbial particles.
   The root bwa- ‘end’ is verbal and receives a verbalising person and mood
marker: bwatse ‘it is finished’. This verbaliser may be implicit (see 7.5.1.), and
as a result bwa may also be used as a particle, provided the context allows, e.g.
terminating a narrative. For numeral use it normally receives the classifier -koje
‘hand’: bwako'je ‘five’ (lit. ‘end of the hand’).
   In family II, where all generations speak Kwaza as their mother’s tongue,
counting to five was done in the following manner:(886) 1   tei'hͿ                  ‘one’
      2   aky'hͿ                  ‘two’
      3   e'mã                    ‘three’
      4   ele'le                  ‘four’
      5   bwako'je                ‘five’In family I, where the youngest generation speaks predominantly Aikanã or
Portuguese, people often count to five as follows:(887) 1   tei'hͿ                  ‘one’
      2   aky'hͿ                  ‘two’
      3   aky'hͿ e'mã             ‘three’
216       4. The noun phrase          4     aky'hͿ e'mã ele'le        ‘four’
          5     bwako'je                  ‘five’Any one of these numerals can function as the basis of a verb: tei'hͿtse ‘it is
one’. When the numeral composes several parts, only the ultimate part is ver-
balised: aky'hͿ e'mãtse ‘they’re three’, and:(888) xyi aky-'ta e'mã-xa-xa-ta o'ja-xa-ra
      you two-ANI more-2-AS-CSO leave-AS-IMP
      ‘you three are leaving!’Beyond ‘five’, numeral counting is done in a variable and sometimes idiolectal
manner. Laborious periphrases in the form of full sentences were encountered.
The fact that there is no clear regular system suggests that the numerals in
Kwaza are not a grammaticalised category. In fact, neither the Kwaza, nor the
neighbouring Aikanã are used to counting further than five, so maybe that is
the reason for the variation and contradictions I was presented with.131 Above
five, the Kwaza usually count in Portuguese, although under five Portuguese
may also be used. In the following list, all Kwaza numeral expressions found
are listed, with the numbers they refer to and their literal translations:1     tei'hͿ                                       ‘one’
1     tͅi'hͿ                                       ‘one’
2     aky'hͿ                                       ‘two’
2     aky'ta                                       ‘two persons, non-vegetals’132
3     e'mã                                         ‘three’131.From my brief and shallow investigations it appears that there is only little similarity
    between the Kwaza and Aikanã numeral systems. According to my Aikanã consult-
    ant Paulo, the numbers above ‘five’ are always counted in Portuguese, and some-
    times even for those below ‘five’ Portuguese is used. It is not known to me in which
    way the following Aikanã forms are further analysable:      1       'amİmİ""hİ̘ / a'mİmİ""hİ̘       ‘one’
      2       'atuka""hİ̘                    ‘two’
      3       'atuka'mİmİ""hİ̘               ‘two one’
      4       'atuka?'atuka?i'mͿitö""hİ̘     ‘two two ?’
      5       'atuka?'atuka?a'mİmİ""hİ̘      ‘two two one’
      6       'arü""pİ̘ / 'arü""pİ            ‘many’The Aikanã system seems to resemble more the Kanoê system, where there are also two
    numbers and where e.g. ‘three’ is represented by ‘two-one’ etc. as in Aikanã (Ba-
    celar 2004).
132.On one occasion the animate form was explained to me in terms of proximity differ-
    ences: akytatse ‘they are two (remote)’ and aky(hͿ)tse ‘they are two (here)’, but this
    may have been caused by the specific context.

    not clear which of the analyses is the right one.

20 aky'hͿ e'mã ele'le                     ‘two and more many’ (4)The basic structures of these complex numerals can be divided into two types:
juxtaposition and cosubordination. The expression for ‘three’ is a juxtapositive
construction:(889) aky-'hͿ         e'mã
      two-NOM more
      ‘three’ (lit. ‘two and one more’)It is excluded that (889) represents a modification construction, because other-
wise it would have meant ‘six’ or ‘two more’. In addition to modification, the
secondary function of juxtaposition is coordination. Therefore, I analyse the
structure of such complex numerals as coordinate. This construction is dis-
cussed further in section (8.5.). Another construction through which complex
numerals are expressed is cosubordination:(890) bwa-ko'je-tja        aky-'hͿ-tse
      end-CL:hand-CSO two-NOM-DEC
      ‘seven’ (lit. ‘a hand ending it is two (fingers)’)(891) bwa-ko'je-tja         aky-ko'je-tse
      end-CL:hand-CSO two-CL:hand-DEC
      ‘fifteen’ (lit. ‘a hand ending it is two hands’)In these examples both numerals are zero-verbalised, and then placed in a me-
dial clause structure. The cosubordination construction is discussed in
(8.3.1.10.) and (8.5.).
    Note that the root aky- ‘two’ may have a paucal connotation.134 Consider the

5.2.3. ImperativeThe imperative mood marker -ra is used to indicate the speech act of com-
manding by which the hearer can be required, requested or invited to do some-
thing. The imperative marker attracts stress.(1355)     wady-'ra                     (1356)     wa'dy-e'teja-'ra

singular, which is zero-marked, and second person plural, which is marked by
-xa-. Zero-marking is explicitly indicated only in the first two of the examples

son represents third person, the default value of the imperative is second per182.According to MA this answer is a bit harsh. Nicer is: tsy're ‘would it be?’
302   5. The verb phraseson. The second person plural imperative is marked by -xa-, and this form con-
trasts with second person plural form -xa-xa- of the declarative and other
moods. The following examples represent strong evidence for this:(1363)    xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-ra                      xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-xa-ki
          you        hit-AS-IMP                   you       hit-2-AS-DEC
          ‘you hit!’                    vs.       ‘you hit’(1364)    xyi aky-'ta        e'mã-xa-xa-ta o'ja-xa-ra          Ba'hozo-na
          you two-ANI        more-2-AS-CSO leave-AS-IMP        Barroso-LOC
          ‘you three, go to Barroso!’As explained in (5.1.), the element -xa-xa- consists of the second person ele-
ment -xa- and a homophonous associated person marker -xa-. Considering the
fact that second person is zero-marked for the singular subject of the impera-
tive, it is likely that it is also zero-marked for a plural subject. Therefore, the
element -xa- in the second person plural imperative represents associated per-
son, and not second person.
    In spite of the fact that -xa- in most imperative sentences represents a plural
subject, there are examples of the imperative in which -xa- is used for second
person singular. In the next example, which is from a mythical tale, the en-
chanted tapir is being addressed by a group of women:(1365)    huruja=du'hͿ-İteja-xa-ra
          like=all-1PO-2-IMP
          ‘make love to us all!’ (t)Compare this example to (1356). The tapir from this tale is a singular being
with a solitary life. And far as I am aware no special register was used in this
tale. Therefore, I have interpreted -xa- as a second person subject marker.
    Imperative verbs were never attested bearing any other subject person
marking than either zero or -xa-. Imperative verbs can be marked for any kind
of object and the same forms are used as in the declarative, with one exception.
The declarative first person object -ta- corresponds to the imperative (and
monitory) first person singular object -ta?Ϳ-:(1366)    wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-'ra (*wadytara)          (1367)    aredy'ta-ta?Ϳ-'ra

         see-NOM-1SO-AS-IMP
         ‘help!’ (lit. ‘you pl. look at me!’)   The negative imperative is expressed by a different morpheme -ky, which
will be treated in (5.2.7.). Nevertheless, some instances of a negative mor-
pheme in combination with imperative -ra were attested. They are rather em-
phatic:(1371)   ehͿ-'he-ca-ra                   (1372)    ja-'he-ca-xa-ra
         make-NEG-EMP-IMP                          eat-NEG-EMP-2-IMP

                                                   you (PL) are nót going to eat!’Note that -ra is not immediately attached to negative -he- in this construction.
The intervening element -ca- will be discussed below in section (5.2.3.3.).
5.2.3.1. -tsy- as an imperative elementNo mitigated version of the imperative has been identified with absolute cer-
tainty. Sometimes the imperative can be expressed by an alternative construc-
tion which involves the potential/future morpheme -tsy-:(1373)   hako're    oja'nͿ-e-ra     / hako're             ojanͿ-'?e-xa-tsy-tse
         tomorrow return-again-IMP/ tomorrow              return-again-2-POT-DEC
         ‘tomorrow you (sg/pl) come again’The next examples show that the alternative imperative construction with po-
tential -tsy- may also be zero marked for second person just like the canonical
imperative construction is (note that both are embedded as reported speech
constructions, see 5.5.11.).(1374)   hã    mǊi-'ra-tsy-le-'hͿ                   bõ'rõ-tse

         ‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’
304   5. The verb phraseThe difference between overt and zero marked second person in the imperative
construction with potential -tsy- is discussed in section (8.1.1.1.).
    The consultant regarded the imperative content of the alternative expres-
sions as equally strong or equally nice. On one occasion, however, the potential
construction was indicated as a mitigated and possibly euphemistic alternative
to the imperative:(1376)   wayrjͿ-'ra          /      way'rjͿ-xa-tsy-tsİ
         clean-IMP                  clean-2-POT-DEC
         ‘clean!’                   ‘you may clean’
5.2.3.2. -ta as an imperative elementThe procrastinative morpheme -tara- ‘later’, ‘do first’ was discussed above and
demonstrated in example (1268). In the declarative it cannot precede -ki but
only -tsİ. In the imperative it can only be succeeded by a verb-final element -ta.
This element -ta is not a cosubordinative marker, as it is clearly imperative in
combination with -tara-.(1377)   e'hͿ-tara-'ta
         make-PROC-IMP
         ‘do that first! (before going away)’(1378)   ka'we 'kui-tara-'ta                       (1379)   here?ece-'hͿ-tara-'ta

         ‘drink coffee first!, wait for the coffee!’        ‘rest first!’Maybe -ta should be regarded as an allomorph of -ra, although it only occurs in
this construction. The morpheme -tara- is involved in several different con-
structions and will be treated by itself in section (5.5.19.).","[339, 340, 341, 342]"

9.3.   Some expressions for geometrical shapesThe word e'rje ‘mesh, comb’ has to do with a pattern of crossing lines, as in a
net, sieve etc. It consists of a dummy root and a classifier (cf. 4.2.2.4.):

pressed by reduplication. The transitive verb root nõita- ‘to dot’ probably con-
tains a lexicalised transitivising morpheme -ta-. In order to refer not to the ac-

9.4.   Kinship terminologyIn fieldwork interviews about kinship terminology it is necessary not to be-
come too abstract. In general, people get confused after several questions like
“and how do you call the son of your sister-in-law?”, and they will start to give
terms that only match for part of the question, or invert the question and give
the term which is used by the kinsperson for ego, or give wrong terms alto-
gether. In the ideal situation, one should be specific and ask terms for existing
persons, e.g. “how do you call Almir?”, which obviously requires that you
know as many family members as possible by name and in what way they are
related to the consultant (‘ego’). However, the original full Kwaza kinship
system is not matched for all of its members by living representants at this
moment.
    In present-day Kwaza society, not all attested kinship terms can be used any
more. It is no longer realistic to speak of a Kwaza “society”, or even a “com-
munity”. The Kwaza were reduced considerably during the decades following
first contact with the Westerners and have been living in pluri-ethnic commu-
nities with Kanoê, Salamãi, Aikanã and Tuparí since the ensuing introduction419.When referring to distorted forms of the human body, such as a crooked leg, the root
    koiloi- is considered more suitable than lowİ̘-.
                                                        9.4. Kinship terminology    721of rubber extraction in the early 1930’s. Although the population has nearly
doubled since Carlson’s visit in 1984, it consists now of only two families with
25 members in total. These are divided into several nuclear families in three of
which Kwaza is spoken on a daily basis.
    There are probably only very remote ties of kinship between the families,
and at the present no intermarriage is foreseen. In-’laws’ are nearly all Aikanã
and some are Nambikwara or absent and unidentified. Half of the members of
family I (ME) is of Aikanã ethnic identity, and the consultants from this family
have no Kwaza uncles, cousins, nephews and nieces or in-laws. Although the
relevant consultants in family II (AN) are in the same situation, the majority is
of Kwaza ethnic identity. As a consequence there is much more insecurity
about certain parts of kinship terminology in family I than in family II, which
results in less dependable information from the former. The consultants from
family II were able to give a more complete and consistent set of kinship terms
than family I. They are all given in table (37) below.
    All grandparents are called ha'kai. This term is probably related to the root
haka- ‘old’. Father and mother are a'ha and mã respectively. Aunts and uncles
are differentiated as to their status by blood or as in-law. True uncle is ta'la and
true aunt is mãduku'tay, which contains the word for mother, and an unidenti-
fied element. Uncle-in-law is ahadu'ky, a term which contains the word for fa-
ther, and possibly the root duky- ‘other’. In-law male cousins also contain this
root: duky'xwa. It is possible that -duku- in mãduku'tay ‘true aunt’ is also re-
lated to this root duky- ‘other’. Aunt-in-law is koreda'ra. It is conspicuous that
the terms for the parent of the husband or wife of ego are identical to ‘true un-
cle’ and ‘aunt-in-law’.420 The terminology for brothers and sisters depends par-
tially on relative age. This is investigated in (9.5.). Children of ego are
eto'hoi.421 There is a set of terms for cousins: to ƃ txare'wa and Ƃ ma?Ϳ'tİ.
Etymologically ma?Ϳ'tİ may be related to mã ‘mother’, with an original resul-
tative noun marker -te (see 5.6.6.). The female classifier -tay is found on
‘niece’, ‘cousin’ and ‘true aunt’. It is uncertain whether txare'wa could be re-
lated to tswa ‘man’. Nephews and nieces are ƃ ko're and Ƃ kore'tay, whereas
their children again are termed ƃ txare'wa and Ƃ ma?Ϳ'tİ.422 Both grandchil-
dren of ego and children of cousins are kore?anͿ'tİ. This term contains also the
aforementioned nominaliser -te. Husbands of the children of ego are ko're, and
wives of the children of ego are kore?u'ty. Note that several terms for directly
related female kinsfolk contain the classifier -tay ‘woman’, whereas terms for420.If there is a mistake in the terminology as sketched here, it may lie either with the
    terminology for the parents of husband/wife, or with the terminology for un-
    cles/aunts.
421.The distinction between masculine and feminine equivalents of this word tswatohoi
    and etaytohoi respectively, does not concern the sex of offspring in general, but the
    sex of children between 10 and 15 years of age, and therefore belongs to age-group
    terminology, which is discussed below.
422.Or ƃ kore and Ƃ koretay, although this is uncertain.
722   9. Lexico-semantic categoriesin-law female kinsfolk contain the nominal suffix -uty (see 4.4.3.). Optional use
of -tay in ma?Ϳtİ'tay ‘niece’ and hidi'tay ‘older sister’ is considered as endear-
ing.
    Could it be that the Kwaza had a system similar to those of other Amazo-
nian peoples, where for instance ego could marry his aunt-in-law, or his cousin
or his niece? On several occasions this was suggested by consultants. It is
likely that kinship terminology reflects patterns of marriageability and marks
the boundaries of incestuous engagement, which is culturally determined as a
result of the traditionally prevailing circumstances (see Melatti 1993:83-96). In
addition to the factors mentioned earlier, missionaries and other Westerners
have been trying to suppress “promiscuity” and polygamy for several decades
now, so possible traditional systems of marriage, exchange of women and in-
cest taboos have likely become obsolete. All of this contributes to the difficulty
to establish what the traditional patterns were, and consequently, the values of
the kinship terms elicited. From the kinskip terminology table (37) it is not per-
fectly clear to whom ego can marry. Probably, there is no incestual ban on in-
tercourse or marriage with ƃ txare'wa and Ƃ ma?Ϳ'tİ. It is less likely that kins-
folk referred to by a term containing the root kore- are marriageable to ego.
One of the reasons to suppose this is that there is no sex differentiation in the
terms for grandchildren of ego, kore?anͿ'tİ, but there is for grandchildren of
nephew and niece, as shown above. Furthermore ko're also shows up in the
terms for son and daughter-in-law and as part of koreda'ra ‘aunt-in-law’. So if
ego can marry with txare'wa of ma?Ϳ'tİ he will either cross a relatively large
gap from the pespective of blood-ties: a cousin is related only via the grandpar-
ents, who are two levels away; or a gap in terms of generation difference: the
child of a nephew or niece is two generations away.
    Kinship terminology is reportedly not used vocatively in family II, whereas
it is in family I (note that Kwaza has no vocative morpheme). It is by MA con-
sidered ugly to use the words for ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ vocatively. Personal
names can be used vocatively.
    In kinship terminology there hardly seems to have been any influence from
other languages. The word mã shows similarities to Aikanã ?ma?ma (Carlson
1984:72) mama (Becker-Donner 1955:306), Kanoê mu(j) (Bacelar 1996:31) or
mõ (Becker-Donner 1955:306) ‘mother’ and Quechua mama (Willem Adelaar
pc). Not very many indigenous languages of the Americas have similar forms
for ‘mother’. There may be a relation between Kwaza ko're and Kanoê ko'ro
‘nephew’, and between the second part of Kwaza kore?anͿ'tİ and Kanoê nǊ'ti
‘grandson’.

724     9. Lexico-semantic categories9.5.    Brother-sister terminologyThere is a subsystem of terms to denote true brothers and sisters where age
relative to the age of ego is involved. In the kinship terminology table above,
persons to the left of ego are older than ego and to the right they are younger.
Furthermore there is differentiation not only in accordance with the sex of a
kinsperson, but also as to sex of ego. So this could be considered as an instance
of separate registers for male and female speakers. Other sex-determined
speech variation was not encountered in Kwaza, nor are there recollections of
such in the past.423 The functional load of the terms for ‘brother’ and ‘sister’ in
Kwaza can be schematised as follows:Table 38. Brother-sister terminology
                                                          sex of ego
       age           sex of kin                 ƃ                          Ƃ
        +                ƃ                      djy                       hƭdjͅ
                         Ƃ                                   hidi
        -                ƃ                                   tsiki
                         Ƃ                      jãky                       tsikiOne could infer from this table that in terms of differentiation of reference pos-
sibilities, brothers are in certain respects “privileged” on the basis of sex, and
somewhat “discriminated” on the basis of age, whereas sisters are somewhat
less privileged on the basis of sex and to a certain extent more on the basis of
age. It is not certain that there is a hierarchy connected to this differentiation,
e.g. a hierarchy of social importance based on age and sex distinctions like:
older brother > younger sister > older sister > younger brother. There has been
a certain level of sex-segregation in traditional Kwaza and Aikanã society.
Apart from roles like male hunter and female housekeeper, there were strong
taboos on contact between the sexes in initiation periods, and certain types of
ritual music performances. On the other hand, both men and women could ful-
fil the role of chief or shaman.
     This subsystem of reference is still equally intact in both families, and there
do not seem to be differences in form or use between them. It is interesting that
instead of mãduku'tay ‘true aunt’ also hi'di ‘older sister’ can be used. And in-
stead of e'hei in the case of a brother-in-law who is married to an older sister, a
male ego may say 'djy-tjate lit. ‘older brother of his’.
     Etymologically, Kwaza brother-sister terminology is intransparent as there
are no other meanings in Kwaza. There seems to be no generic term for broth423.There is a traditional tale only about the use of a different word for ‘jaguar’, to be
    used by women when they are in the forest without “protection” by a man, although
    this story is laughed at (see part II).
                                                             9.7. Social roles   725ers and/or sisters, but there is an associative suffix -mİ for kinship terms, as in
e.g. hidi'mİ ‘(my) older sisters’ (see 4.4.2.).
    The word for ‘twins’, aky-'tohoi-tsy-hͿ, is analysable as ‘two-child-GER-
NOM’. The word for ‘orphan (which has the sense of being without father and
mother)’, awãnͿ'ce-tohoi, may be analysable as ‘show-child’, although there
may be a relation with the verb root ãwãte- ‘to be sad’.
    There are imaginable connections between Kwaza hi'di ‘older sister’ and
Salamãi hƭnd`i ‘mother’ (Becker-Donner 1955:306), between Kwaza jã'ky and
Kanoê njákòró ‘younger sister’ (Becker-Donner 1955:308), or naké ‘nubile
girl’ (Bacelar 1996:32). In Guarani, the system of terminology for brother and
sister is based on the same parameters of sex and age (Gregores and Suárez
1967).","[756, 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 762, 763]"

4.1.1.9. Concluding remarksIn conclusion, we can say that objects of transitive verbs tend to be case
marked in the first place because they belong to the animate category. When
they are inanimate, case marking is ungrammatical. From a formal point of
view, case marking is not strictly necessary in order to distinguish between the
subject and the object, because the subject is identified by cross-reference
marking on the verb. However, if all arguments are third persons there is room
for ambiguity. In the absence of case marking, if both subject and object are
animate third persons, there would be no way to know on the basis of the syn-
tax alone which would be what. From a pragmatic point of view, the absence of
case marking generally does not create ambiguity when the verbal object is in-
animate. The same holds for indirect objects of semantically ditransitive verbs:
it is usually people who give things to living beings. So, if the case marker -wã
were an animacy marker alone, the disambiguation function would be an auto-
matic side effect. Nevertheless, it is essential when the arguments of transitive
verbs are equal in animacy and person. Therefore -wã is bifunctional: it serves
to mark both animacy and objecthood. At the same time, it reflects the much
attested pragmatically based tendency to prefer to give subject function to ani-
mate beings (see e.g. Comrie 1989:128). From the contrast between certain
verbs, remember the pair (106) and (107), it appears also that in the grammar of
Kwaza, human beings are higher on the animacy hierarchy than non-human
animate beings.
    The occurrence of -wã on inanimate nouns, as in (197), is not understood in
the light of the present analysis.
    For some verbs no information was obtained regarding the question whether
animate object marking is optional, obligatory or ungrammatical:(199) dilİ-'wã oi'tsi-tsy-hͿ-'re              (200) ã'rǊi-wã 'mǊ-ki

an adverbialising function. This is discussed in (6.2.4.3.).","[158, 159]"

6.1.   Basic adverbsKwaza has a limited number of basic adverbs. There are two kinds of basic ad-
verbs. One is represented by independent lexemes which are morphologically
simplex. The other one consists of lexemes which show morphological com-
plexity but which are not productively formed. The following list contains all
attested simplex adverbs of the first kind:
486   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressions(2546)   ãi               ‘far, distant’
         da'nͿ            ‘still, yet’
         ele'le           ‘very (EMPH), only (EMPH.PL)’
         hade'ja          ‘by night’
         ha'ja            ‘by day’
         hary'ky          ‘now, then (interjection of hesitation)’
         ƭ                ‘idly, in vain, nothing’
         ja               ‘already’
         ka'le            ‘actually, in reality’
         ka'tsy           ‘soon, quickly’
         la'to            ‘yesterday’
         tsãrãrã'te       ‘low’
         tsǊ'hǊ           ‘what?’
         txa'rwa          ‘first, now, today’
         wa'txi           ‘truly, correct’These adverbs are etymologically neither easily relatable to one another, nor to
other known lexemes. The next list contains the adverbs which behave as mor-
phologically simplex adverbs but which show internal morphological structure:(2547)   anãi'dy          ‘rightly, properly’
         a'renͿ'ta        ‘noon’, ‘the hours before noon’
         a'rwalİ          ‘long ago’
         awani'hͿ         ‘alone’

         İhͿ?İ'hͿ         ‘suddenly’

         hako're          ‘tomorrow’
         ƭ'wã             ‘nothing, in vain’
         jale'ja          ‘in the past’

         tͅi'tja          ‘alone’
         tjahİ'rjͿ        ‘elsewhere’
         tsiri'tsa        ‘in the middle’
         txatxarwa'te     ‘just now, suddenly, for the very first time’
         watxi'le(-)      ‘finally’, ‘so, then’Note here the occurrence of elements which resemble productive morphemes
such as -hͿ (NOM), -nãi- (NOM), -dy- (CAU, POS), -wã (AO), -ta (CSO) and -tja
(CSO). Note also possible roots such as are- ‘turn’ (at noon the sun is going to
                                                              6.1. Basic adverbs     487change its course from rising to descending). Note furthermore the recurring
root forms such as tͅi- (which may be related to tei- ‘one’274) the empty root a-,
and the adverbs ja ‘already’ and haja ‘day’. Note finally reduplication of İhͿ.
These morphological regularities have to be considered as fossilised. In the first
place, as the main word accent in Kwaza always falls on the last syllable of the
root, the apparent suffixes noticed here have to be considered as inalienable
parts of the root. Secondly, the ostensible morphological structure cannot be
altered, because, as an example, -hͿ cannot be replaced by another morpheme:
*awani-ki, *awani-xy, etc., and hence, -hͿ is not a productive nominaliser or
classifier here.
    The adverbs are canonically employed to modify predicates. The following
examples illustrate this for the adverbs of list (2546):(2548)    ãi     'a-ki

bedded in a complement clause. Of the three logically possible positions, the
position in which the adverb is separated by a clause boundary from the verb it
modifies is not allowed:(2578)    (*lato)      u'te-da-mͿ (la'to)         kukui'hͿ-da-nãi         (la'to)

ify the other adverbs. In such constructions one adverb often modifies the ver-
bal root of the subsequent adverb, as in (2579) and (2580), but this is not al-
ways the case, as in (2581):277.The adverb can be placed in any alternative position in the sentence. The expression
    involving Benefactive/Causative -dy- must be a calque on Portuguese fazer aniver-
    sário, lit. ‘make anniversary’.

and occur as roots of matrix predicates, nominalised verbs, etc.:(2582)    'ãi-ki      (2583)    ãi-'hͿ-da-ki       (2584)       'ãi-Ϳ-xy

          still turtle exist-INT                      still-INT turtle
          ‘is the turtle still there?’                ‘is the turtle still there?’Few cases were documented of medial clauses (see 8.3.) used as adverbials.
The following example shows a medial clause marked for switch reference and
based on an adverbial root:(2587)    ha'ja-Ϳ-si     mƭu       kui-da-da-'ta-da-ki
          day-ATT-SWR chicha drink-1S-1S-CSO-1S-DEC

          RED-like-CSO day-ATT-SWR what-NOM know-1S-DEC
          ‘every day I understand better’Note, however, that ha'ja?Ϳsi is sometimes also pronounced as ha'ja?ƭ'si ‘every
day’:278.This is actually an adverbial clause, the structure of which will be discussed in
    (6.2.4.1.).
                                                         6.1. Basic adverbs   491(2589)   na-'nãi-tja     ha'ja?ƭsi    'hudada-'ta-da-ki
         RED-like-CSO    every.day speak-TRA-1S-DEC
         ‘every day I speak with him (in order to teach him)’On one occasion this was explicitly reported to be the correct pronunciation.
Furthermore, a similar expression involving hakuri ‘moon, month’ was consid-
ered to be children’s speech: hakuri?ƭsi ‘every month’. Possibly haja?ƭsi is a
lexicalising variant of haja?Ϳi.
    Not all adverbs have the same properties. The adverbs hary'ky ‘now’, ƭ
‘idly’, txa'rwa ‘first’ and most of list (2547) were never attested with verbal
morphology. Many adverbs have relatively ideosyncratic properties. The ad-
verb kale ‘actually’, which contradicts presuppositions, is often combined with
a matrix verb ending in the resignation morpheme -tsy:(2590)   ka'le     'İ-tsy-hͿ-tsy
         actually go-GER-NOM-RES
         ‘actually (he did not sleep here but) he went away’(2591)   ka'le      na-ay-'hͿ          mã-a-ra'ti-tsy    ka'le kwa'za-ta
         actually PROX-that-NOM call-1P-FOC-RES actually Kwaza-CSO
         ‘it is actually him which (the Aikanã) call Kwaza’In the next example kale probably modifies the entire proposition rather than
the single predicate:(2592)   ka'le    hİin Ϳ'nͿ-da-hͿ-tsy
         actually Hein be.called-1S-NOM-RES
         ‘(I’m known as Henrique, but) actually I’m called Hein’  The emphatic element elele ‘very’ functions as an intensifying adverb in
combination with a preceding nominal:(2593)   na-ay-xu'ko         ele'le 'a-ki       (2594)    e'tay ele'le
         PROX-that-SETT      very exist-DEC               women very
         ‘he lives in the same place’                     ‘just the women’ (t)(2595)   'si-dy-hͿ   ele'le
         I-POS-NOM very
         ‘only mine, my very ones (and not someone else’s)’In addition to its function as an emphatic adverb, elele also functions as a nu-
meral element (see 4.5.), which is probably a derived function.
   The interrogative adverb tsǊhǊ ‘what?’ can with just as much right be con-
sidered as a noun, verb or adverb. It is often zero-verbalised and used for a
matrix verb:
492   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressions(2596)    tsǊ'hǊ-xa-re
          what-2-INT
          ‘what do you want?’, ‘what happened to you?’It is often case marked as if it were a noun:(2597)    tsǊhǊ-'du                  (2598)     tsǊhǊ-ra'ti-wã jari'mã ja-'re
          what-BER                              what-FOC-AO jarimã say-INT
          ‘what for?’                           ‘what does “jarimã” mean?’It may occur as the basis of a noun modifier:(2599)    tsǊhǊ-ra'ti mani'ni ja-da-'re=jã-hͿ
          what-FOC fish         eat-1S-INT=be-NOM
          ‘I don’t know what kind of fish I ate’In the following example it may be difficult to establish whether it has to be
interpreted as an adverb, a verb argument, or a complement:(2600)    tsǊ'hǊ pİ̘rİ̘'jã-xa-re
          what      speak-2-INT
          ‘what are you saying?’    The adverbs are quite a heterogenous category. The element haryky ‘now’
has another, possibly derived meaning of indicating a hesitation or a pause in
one’s speech, without wanting to pass one’s turn of speech on to someone else.
It is also discussed in (7.7.4.).
    In the next example the canonical adverb ãi ‘far’ occurs twice:(2601)    'tana ãi     hã     du'ky-mǊ-na            ãi     o'ja-xa-tsy-tse
          well far water other-CL:liquid-LOC far go-2-POT-DEC
          ‘therefore you are going to another river far from here’ (t)It is unclear whether the first occurrence of ãi is topicalised here and repeated
later, or whether it functions as an adjective modifying the subsequent locative
phrase.
    There is one adverbial root in (2547) that is always followed by productive
morphology, but that is never used in another way than adverbial: bony- ‘next,
again’. In the following examples it bears the nominalising suffix -hͿ, although
it functions as an adverb:(2602)    bony-'hͿ    tsa'si-xa-tsy-tse
          again-NOM follow-2-POT-DEC
          ‘you will come next (I’m already going)’
                                                           6.1. Basic adverbs   493(2603)    kui-'he-da-ki        bony-'hͿ   kui-da-ta'ra-tse
          drink-NEG-1S-DEC again-NOM drink-1S-PROC-DEC
          ‘I did not drink, later I will’In the subsequent examples, it bears the adverbialising suffix -wy:(2604)    bony-'wy     ja-da-tara-'tse
          again-time eat-1S-PROC-DEC
          ‘next time I will come to eat there (not now)’(2605)    bony-'wy      wa'ja-da-tsy-tse
          again-time bring-1S-POT-DEC
          ‘I will take her there later (not now)’The root bony- was never encountered with any other suffixes replacing -hͿ or
-wy. The difference with the attributive root duky- ‘other’ concerns precisely
this property. The form duky'wy ‘another time, on another day’ is used as an
adverb, but when -wy is replaced by -hͿ it functions as a noun. Furthermore,
-hͿ can be replaced by any other classifier. Therefore, duky'wy is the result of
productive adverbialising morphology, which is discussed in (6.2.4.), whereas
bonywy is based on a special adverbial root and hence, discussed in the present
section.
    There is no general semantic distinction between the first (2546) and the
second (2547) list of adverbs. Semantically defined groupings of adverbs such
as manner, time and evidential, may consist in both etymologically simplex and
complex lexemes. Adverbs referring to time of the day, for example, are found
in both lists. Besides these, there is a small number of time of the day adverbs
which are even formed through relatively productive morphological operations:(2606)    haja'jadyko're          ‘tomorrow morning’
          lato'wy                 ‘the day before yesterday’
          hakore'wy               ‘the day after tomorrow’
          (sile'ta                ‘afternoon’, ‘at dusk’, ‘at night’)
          tsiri'tsanã'wã          ‘midnight’The adverb hakore ‘tomorrow’ in list (2546) may consist originally of the
empty root a- and the directional -kore- ‘matutinal, of the morning’ but if it
were a productive formation, the initial “h” would not be expected. The adverb
hajadykore ‘this morning’ in list (2547) may consist originally of the adverb
haja followed by the possessive morpheme -dy- as if it were a noun, and the
directional -kore- ‘matutinal’ as if that were a classifier. However, this is also a
morphologically unexpected constellation. Partial reduplication as observed in
haja'jadyko're ‘tomorrow early’ in list (2606) is discussed in (6.2.2.) as a sepa-
rate morphological process in adverb formation.
494   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressions   The adverb tsiri'tsanã'wã ‘midnight’ consists of an irregularly formed ad-
verb based on the combination of a directional as discussed in (6.2.1.) and a
classifier as discussed in (6.2.3.):(2607)   tsiri'tsa-nãwã
         middle-CL:sky
         ‘midnight’   The adverb sileta ‘afternoon’ is possibly based on a verb root sile- ‘be
night’, which does not occur as an independent lexeme itself.(2608)   tsile'ta       wai'rjͿ-ki
         afternoon nice.weather-DEC
         ‘it is a beautiful afternoon’It seems unlikely that the element -ta can be analysed further. However, the oc-
currence of a different subject marker -dy- in the following rare example re-
minds of a cosubordinated clause (8.3.):(2609)   si'le-dy-ta       wã'wͿi-ki
         night-DS-CSO sleep-DEC
         ‘he slept in the afternoon’In this example, both verbs have different subjects and the literal meaning
could be ‘as it got night he slept’. However the free translation refers to the
time of the afternoon. The fact that medial clauses may sometimes have an ad-
verbial function was attested in (2587). In combination with the free translation
‘afternoon’, example (2609) suggests that the element -ta in sile'ta could be a
cosubordinative morpheme. However, the different subject marker is unexpect-
edly absent in the next example:(2610)   sile'ta        wã'wͿi-da-ki
         afternoon sleep-1S-DEC
         ‘I slept in the afternoon’Furthermore, sileta ‘afternoon’ may be embedded in a medial clause itself, as
in example (3437) in section (8.2.2.3). Because of this I regard it primarily as
an adverb, be it possibly with lexicalised morphology that sometimes betrays
its origin.
    The adverbs latowy ‘the day before yesterday’ and hakore'wy ‘the day after
tomorrow’ are the semantically unpredictable result of an otherwise productive
morphological operation, which is discussed in (6.2.4.1.).
    Adverbs of direction and location form a semantically definable sub-group
of adverbs. These adverbs are usually formed through the combination of an
empty root a- and a directional morpheme (see 5.3.). Because these adverbs are

8.2.2.2. Frustrative and antithetic -le-(hͿ)-There is an “antithetic” or “counterfactual” concessive construction that one
could call the frustrative. It employs the elements -le-(hͿ)- in various ways. The
frustrative element -le- often indicates that a certain situation in the past does
not obtain any more, or that something has “nearly” happened. In combination
with nominaliser -hͿ(-) there can be a connotation of regret. It has not been es-
tablished whether frustrative -le- is related to preconditional -lİ or concessive
-lete.
    The subordinate clause may contain clause-final -le-hͿ while the matrix
verb is in the declarative:
                                                        8.2. Adverbial clauses   641(3396)   rai'hͿ-le-hͿ          hyhy'rwa-nãi 'wai-ki
         ruin-FRUST-NOM move-NOM                 good-DEC
         ‘it (the bridge) is ruined, but (still) good to walk’The subordinate clause in the above example is in a way counterfactual because
the bridge does not appear to be totally ruined. Despite of the impression it
might make one can still walk across. The next example shows that neither an-
titheticity nor counterfactuality are strict, formal-semantic requirements of
frustrative subordination:(3397)   ywy'nwͿ      'dy=asa-'nã-da-le-hͿ              'tãi-ki
         tree         cut=leave-FUT-1S-FRUST-NOM hard-DEC
         ‘I was going to cut away the tree trunk, but it was (too) hard’The subordinate clause in the above example is “antithetic” in that the enter-
prise of cutting away the tree trunk did not have the intended result. It was lit-
erally frustrated because of the hardness of the timber. A situation of similar
antithetic calibre holds in the following example:(3398)   jere'xwa wai'hͿ ã'wͿi-da-le-hͿ               'nã-hͿ-ki
         jaguar nice         see-1S-FRUST-NOM         stink-NOM-DEC
         ‘I saw a beautiful dog but it stank’   The antithetic sense can be reinforced by the intentional conjectural -here-
(see 5.5.14.):(3399)   wai-'he-tsy-hͿ-here-da-le-hͿ                 'wai-ki
         good-NEG-GER-NOM-INTL-1S-FRUST-NOM good-DEC

         wild-INTL-1S-FRUST-NOM
         ‘I thought it was wild (but it is a domestic cat)’   The entire combination -le-hͿ- may also be part of a matrix verb. Often it
express the fact that some situation existed in the past but not any more in the
present. In this way it functions as an aspect marker of arrested progression
(see 5.5.18.):(3401)   emǊ'hͿ-le-hͿ-'ki

         ‘it was wet’ (CX: it has already dried)

          still    arrive-NEG-2-time move-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘I walked a while before you arrived’ (but not thereafter)This sense of ‘situation that obtained in the past and was interrupted’ may also
have a connotation of ‘unfortunately’, ‘what a pity’. The subject in the next ex-
ample is unfortunate because the cigarette ended:(3405)    ui       'hu-le-hͿ-ki
          tobacco smoke-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘he was smoking (but the cigarette ended) unfortunately’The next example apparently does not refer to a past situation, but there is an
antithetic implication in the unfortunate dilemma which it expresses:(3406)    haru'wi ja-a-tsy-'tse-tsy-le-hͿ-ki
          Luiz      eat-1P-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘Luiz invited us/me for dinner, now what to do?’Literally this sentence involves a quotative construction meaning ‘unfortu-
nately Luiz said “we are going to eat”‘. The dilemma lies in the fact that the
hearer and his companion had different plans, but they can impossibly decline
his offer. The following examples also contain quotative constructions and an-
tithetic implications:(3407)    hã    mǊi-tsy-'tse-da-le-'hͿ-ki
          water submerge-POT-DEC-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘I was ordering you to fetch water (but you didn’t)’(3408)    hã     mǊi-(xa)-tsy-'tse-tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
          water submerge-2-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘he said I had to get water, but it’s a pity (it’s not possible)’364364.Remember that potential -tsy- has a mitigated imperative connotation here, and that a
    second person is expressed optionally in this construction. Note also that the ‘com-
    mand’ is embedded in a quoted speech construction, which is why the subject of the
    embedded verb is ultimately a first person object on the discourse-pragmatic level.
                                                      8.2. Adverbial clauses   643(3409)   hã    mǊi-tsy-'tse-tsy-le-'hͿ                  bõ'rõ-tse
         water submerge-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
         ‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’In example (3409) the antithetic phrase is a subordinated adverbial clause,
whereas in (3408) it is part of the matrix verb. The contrast between examples
(3408) and (3409) (repeated from 1375) suggests that the occurrence of -le-hͿ(-
) inside the matrix clause represents a zero-verbalised noun-phrase rather than
an extension of the verb by a verbalising suffix. In fact, it may corroborate the
hypothesis that subordinate clauses in Kwaza are noun phrases.
    -le-hͿ(-) is an analysable combination of different morphemes. In the first
place, -hͿ may be replaced by a specific classifier (see 4.2.):(3410)   a'xy ͅ'hike    'a-tsy-le-xy
         house Henrique exist-GER-FRUST-CL:house
         ‘the house where Henrique lived’ (t)In the second place, the element -hͿ plays a role in nominalisation, which may
produce relative clause-like phrases (see 8.4.1.1.):(3411)   Ǌcenãi-'he-da-hͿ      ere'we-da-ki
         know-NEG-1S-NOM write-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m writing up what I don’t know’Such a nominalised phrase can be zero-verbalised again by the application of a
mood marker:(3412)   si 'kui-da-hͿ-ki         hã         (*kuihͿdaki)
         I drink-1S-NOM-DEC water
         ‘it is me who drank water’365In comparison with the preceding example the element -le- in the next example
may seem to have a sense of an ongoing action in the past which was inter-
rupted at some point (see 5.5.18.):(3413)   si 'kui-da-le-hͿ-ki           hã
         I drink-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC water
         ‘it was me who was drinking water’366The contrast between the next examples in which the element -hͿ does not oc-
cur, also suggests that the element -le- has a sense of interrupted continuous
action:365.MA in POR: eu que tomei agua

           ‘why did you give it?’367                   ‘why were you giving it?’368Canonically, the part -le- by itself creates the antithetic sense of ‘nearly’:(3416)     hy'ja-da-le-ki
           fall-1S-FRUST-DEC
           ‘I nearly fell’The sense of ‘nearly’ is semantically related to the notion of ‘frustrative’ be-
cause it refers to the fact that something which was about to happen did not
happen after all, whether this is fortunate or not. Sometimes, a verb ending in
frustrative -le-hͿ can express this notion:(3417)     rai'hͿ-tsy-le-hͿ
           ruin-GER-FRUST-NOM
           ‘it having nearly broke’Sometimes, -le has a ‘frustrative’ connotation by itself:(3418)     hako'ro mãdu'tu-da-le-(hͿ)-ki

           ‘it was for bathing (but now it has broke down)’369In a non-antithetic context -le helps to express ‘pity’ and ‘regret’ (see also

though it was the case once in the past, or even though it was expected to be the
case. This is the reason why I have discussed -le-(hͿ-) as part of the concessive
category. A verb may contain -le- with this aspect-like meaning, but it can also
be nominalised and then function as a concessive clause. The concessive clause
can be subordinated to a matrix clause, or it can be incorporated in the matrix
clause through zero-derivation.
    Under ellipsis (see 7.5.) of the preceding verb stem or a quoted expression,
-(tsy)-le-hͿ- can occur as a root with context dependent meaning:(3423)    le-'hͿ-ki                          (3424)    tsy-le-'hͿ-ki
          FRUST-NOM-DEC                                GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘yes’, ‘he wanted to’,                       ‘what a pity’ (as e.g. in the
          ‘he was saying’                              context of (3406/3158))(3425)    xa-le-'re
          2-FRUST-INT
          ‘you would like?’ (t)
8.2.2.3. The concessive element -waraThere is another type of concessive construction that is realised through what
looks like subordination of two clauses by an intervening conjunctional ele-
ment (-)wara, roughly translated as ‘but’. The morphological status of this
element is not entirely clear. On the one hand it behaves like an independent
particle, but on the other hand it is very frequently connected to the nominaliser
-hͿ, where it acts as a bound morpheme. In this construction, -hͿ may have
scope over a wide array of phrases from verb roots and independent nouns to
fully-fledged verbal clauses. In this way, -hͿ forms a phonological unit together
with -wara, and may behave as if it were an independent coordinating particle
hͿwara ‘but’.
    In the present analysis, the “but”-concessive clause is regarded as a nomi-
nalised verb that is subordinated to a matrix clause. In these respects, it is
similar to other adverbial clauses. It differs from the other constructions in that
the “but”-concessive clause requires an extra element wara in order to be sub370.This example relates to our mysterious friend Saravi. No-one in Rondônia had been
    able to establish his ethnic identity. He was shot dead in 1995 in Vilhena by a
    rancher for something he did not do. Note that the first -le in this example means
    ‘only, just’ (‘nothing but hair’).
646   8. Subordination and coordinationordinated to the matrix clause. Under the analysis of wara as a cliticised parti-
cle, this concessive construction can be regarded as an analytical equivalent of
the more synthetic concessive construction with -lete, which was discussed in
(8.2.2.1.).
    The following examples represent the most basic occurrence of the “but”-
concessive:(3426)   hy'ja-hͿ=wara        kãu-'he-tse
         fall-NOM=but         break-NEG-DEC

         ‘he does not see but does not use glasses. / he does not see, neverthe-
         less he does not use glasses’In the above examples, the verbal base of the subordinate clause was nomi-
nalised by -hͿ and subordinated to the matrix clause through cliticisation of
wara. In the following example, -hͿ- is a lexicalised part of the verbal base
waihͿ- ‘to be beautiful’. Instead of a subsequent nominaliser, =wara is at-
tached to the verbal base immediately:(3431)   kwa'za-dy-nãi      wai.'hͿ=wara are'ta-da-rai-he-ki
         Kwaza-POS-NOM beautiful=but understand-1S-damn-NEG-DEC
         ‘Kwaza is beautiful but I don’t know a thing’
                                                     8.2. Adverbial clauses   647The expected form *waihͿhͿwara was rejected. This example suggests above
all that although the combination of wai- ‘to be good’ with the element -hͿ- has
a lexicalised meaning of ‘be beautiful’, the same element -hͿ- has preserved
certain grammatical functions. Here, it combines its lexicalised status with its
nominalising subordinating status.
    Note that the predicate of the concessive clause may also be nominalised by
another morpheme such as the temporal nominaliser -wy:(3432)   si aky'nͿda'nͿ     ja-'he-da-wy=wara 'İ-tse
         I friend still     eat-NEG-1S-time=but go-DEC
         ‘(my) friend went away while I had not yet eaten’   The next examples show that in combination with wara, the nominaliser can
have the scope over an entire sentence in the declarative mood. Arguments em-
bedded in the concessive clause may even intervene between its predicate and
the concessive particle:(3433)   oja-e'te-da-tsy-tse       zezƭju-dy-'rjͿ      hͿ=wa'ra
         go-COMIT-1S-POT-DEC       Zezinho-POS-DC:area NOM=but         he'?ai -da-ki

         woman child         leave-DEC NOM=but like-RECI-DEC
         ‘he left wife and children, but nevertheless they loved each other very
         much’These examples suggest of course that -hͿ is not a bound nominalising mor-
pheme any more, but that it has obtained a semi-independent status. If the dis-
course context allows, the conjunctional “particle” can even be “inflected” for
person.(3435)   da-hͿ=wa'ra mãrİ̘'?a-dy-nãi       pİ̘rİ̘'jã-nãi 'e-da-ki
         1S-NOM=but spirit-POS-NOM         speak-NOM have-1S-DEC
         ‘nevertheless I know the Western man’s language’Possibly, the verb root that originally preceded -dahͿwara is understood and
has been omitted. These phenomena of ellipsis and cliticisation were further
discussed in (7.5.). In the following example, hͿwara is used even more inde-
pendently:
648   8. Subordination and coordination(3436)   hͿ=wa'ra     hu-'ra
         NOM=but      smoke-IMP
         ‘nevertheless, smoke!’It was said in a situation in which the hearer had declined an offered smoke but
where the speaker insisted. Here it is possible to maintain that nothing is omit-
ted, but that hͿwara is used as a context-dependent pragmatic particle. In an-
other situation the speaker uttered hͿwara as a single phrase in the figurative
sense of ‘never mind’ or ‘it is no problem’. Here the speaker had offered the
visiting hearer his hammock but the hearer had objected that he had come in
from the rain and that his clothes were wet. The speaker again reacted to this by
hͿwara ‘never mind’. As an equivalent expression he could also have said
na'nãi?Ϳky'wy ‘it is O.K. like that’.
    In quoted speech constructions the concessive conjunction can be realised
through the extended particle tsyhͿwara ‘think that, but’ (see 5.5.11.). There
are other conditions which relate to the element -tsy-. In (8.1.2.3.) it is ex-
plained how -hͿ cannot be preceded immediately by future -nã-, but that -tsy-
has to intervene. This requirement also holds for hͿwara:(3437)   wãwͿi-'nã-tsy-hͿ=wara            tsile'ta    tsile'ta-tja
         sleep-FUT-GER-NOM=but            afternoon   afternoon-CSO         a'wͿi=xare-ri'tsa-hͿ=wara          jerexwa-'le

         ‘(..., and) went to sleep, but early in the night she looked outside, but
         there was a jaguar!’ (t)Notice with respect to the latter example also that the difference between the
subject of the but-clause and the matrix clause does not require formal mark-
ing.
   Notice with respect to the counterfactual concessive example (3348) in
(8.2.1.2.1.) that the but-clause can also refer to a possible non-realised fact.","[678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686]"

8.1.1.1. Potential and person markingConstructions involving potential -tsy- can be marked for any subject person,
including second person singular and plural -xa-. If a person marker is absent,
however, the verb may be ambiguous. Often, zero marking in potential verbs
cross-refers to third persons, but in the ambiguous cases it can also refer to sec-
ond persons. The difference between -xa- and zero-marking for second persons
in verbs containing potential -tsy- is not entirely clear.
    Meanwhile, zero-marked potential verbs ending in -tse are declarative when
the subject is a third person. However, when the zero-marked subject is a sec-
ond person, the verb may have an imperative connotation. As demonstrated in
(5.2.3.) verbs bearing the canonical imperative mood marker -ra may cross-
refer to a singular subject (which is intrinsically a second person) by either zero
or -xa-. It was also demonstrated that in comparison to the canonical impera-
tive, the potential morpheme -tsy- may have a mitigated imperative interpreta-
tion. The examples below and in (5.2.3.1.) suggest that the presence or absence
of second person marker -xa- does not determine this mitigated imperative ef-
fect. On some occasions both potential verbs in which -xa- is present and in
which it is absent (though with a second person interpretation) could be re-
garded as (mitigated) imperative:

         ‘say it if (the food) isn’t good!’          *?”moon, become full!’The latter example was considered anomalous for obvious reasons. Notice that
it was not regarded as a correct third person form of a verb in which -tsy- has a
future interpretation. Compare examples (1463) and (1464) in section (5.2.5.1.)
for the correct version of this.
    In contrast to what the above examples suggest, second person marking in
combination with potential does not always have an imperative effect. The
following example shows that it may have just a future effect:(3240)   i'si-xa-tsy-tse
         die-2-POT-DEC
         ‘you may die’ (CX: what happens if you eat this mushroom?)It is nevertheless possible that zero marked second person potential verbs may
also have just the future effect. Unfortunately, the following examples were
elicited and translated in isolation and it was not possible to inquire explicitly
about their connotations:(3241)   kui-da'mͿ-(xa)-tsy-tse    /   kui-'nã-(xa)-tsy-tse
         drink-want-2-POT-DEC /        drink-FUT-2-POT-DEC
         ‘you’re planning to drink’Zero-marked verbs in the potential seem to cross-refer to second person sub-
jects with or without the imperative effect. Without imperative effect they ei-
ther refer to second or to third person subjects. This implies that the absence or
presence of -xa- is not fully predictable and that there is room for ambiguity

a purposive function:(3248)   cͅrͅ'mǊ e'hͿ-da-mͿ  'kui-da-tsy-hͿ                  eto'hoi-nahe're

tains its valency, and may have embedded lexical arguments. On a morpho-
logical level, these are arguments of that verb stem. However, the internal syn-
tactic structure of the purposive clause is identical to that of a nominal modifi-
cation construction in which the dependent and the (omissible) head are juxta-
posed (see 4.3. and 8.4.1.5.). On a sentence level the adverbial clause is a bene-
ficiary argument satellite of the matrix verb. In the following purposive clauses
the lexical heads represent the subject, object and instrumental satellite argu-
ments, respectively, of the verb stem embedded in the dependent:(3250)   eto'hoi-nahere erewe-tsy-'hͿ

subject of the purposive clause, although this clause can also be regarded ex-
clusively as an adverbial phrase:(3254)     e-si'ki      'bİta-'nã-da-ki    ka'ra-tsy-hͿ
           Ø-CL:skin hang-FUT-1S-DEC dry-POT-NOM
           ‘I’m going to hang out the clothes to dry’In the following example the object of the cosubordinated clause is identical to
the subject of the verbal root of the purposive nominal which functions as the
stem of the matrix verb (‘João’):(3255)     talo-'tja-dy-ta    'İ-tsy-hͿ-ki      zjwãu
           sulk-TRA-DS-CSO go-POT-NOM-DEC João
           ‘by sulking (ignoring him) she made João go away’A literal reading of this example could be: ‘she sulked with João in order for
him to leave’, and the effect appears to be causative.352
    The contrast between the next two examples shows that, instead of nomi-
naliser -hͿ, a specific classifier (see 4.2.) can be applied. This faculty of classi-
fiers to represent specific nominals morphologically, is interconnected with the
phenomenon of omissible heads. The result is an even more synthetic con-
struction in which the head (‘board’) has in a sense “incorporated” the descrip-
tive dependent (‘for you to make a house’):(3256)     a'xy-dy-'xa-tsy-tse

that a nominalised potential verb may have an internally purposive meaning,
even although on the sentential level it may be just a Patiens object argument of
the matrix verb. The next example illustrates that this “incorporation” also ap352.In an alternative analysis, -tsy- can be interpreted as gerundial, which would yield the
    translation ‘the fact that he is/was treated bad is/was a reason for João to leave’. It is
    difficult to say what the best interpretation is.
                                                              8.1. The form -tsy-   613plies to the referent of the nominaliser -hͿ, which can be regarded as a neutral
classifier:(3258)    areta-'dy-ja-tsy-hͿ              /   erewe-xy-'dy-ja-tsy-hͿ

person in order to make people know, c.q. in order to make people write’.353 In
general one may say that a verb which is nominalised by the combination of the
potential morpheme -tsy- with any classifier has become a “purposive noun”.
   It is important to notice that nominalisation of a potential verb does not al-
ways yield a purposive noun, though it retains a future sense:(3259)    o'kja-a-xa-(tara)-tsy-hͿ-herejã-'re

8.1.2. Gerundi(v)al -tsy-In certain positions inside the verb the element -tsy- clearly does not have a
potential sense and it can apparently not be related to the potential morpheme
-tsy- dealt with in the preceding section. The unidentified element -tsy- seems
to be another morpheme with a different meaning, but its exact semantic con-
tents are difficult to establish. Depending on the semantics of the specific verb
stem to which it is attached it may have a durative, progressive or resultative
effect, but its principal function is mildly emphatic. Because it is usually fol-
lowed by a nominaliser, and because this combination replaces declarative -tse
on many occasions, I have analysed it provisionally as a gerundial morpheme:(3266)   lo'te e-'he-tse                  (3267)    lo'te e-'he-tsy-hͿ
         door have-NEG-DEC                          door have-NEG-GER-NOM
         ‘there is no door’                         ‘without door’There could be a morphophonological relation between -tsy- and declarative
-tse. The main reason why -tsy- is not regarded here as an outright allomorph of
-tse is because -tse is analysed as a verb-final mood marker. If a verb is nomi-
nalised, the mood marker is normally truncated and replaced by the nominalis-
ing morpheme. Nevertheless, formal, distributional and perhaps semantic cor-
respondences warrant the suspicion that gerundial -tsy- may derive from de-
clarative -tse.
    Example (3267) above means literally: ‘the one not having a door’. It is
possible that -tsy- has an emphatic cleft function. In the following examples,
-tsy- causes contrastive focus:(3268)   nͿ-'xy-tsy-hͿ

one do you want?’. The fact that -hͿ is a nominaliser which can be replaced by
a specific classifier (see also 4.2.) is a reason to regard -tsy- as an element
which is not inextricably fused with -hͿ:(3270)    koreja'ri      nͿ-'ri-tsy-ri

          ‘(while) being a place with only grass’ (t)Further evidence that -hͿ is nominaliser here is that it can be marked for case:(3275)    ywy'nwͿ    kara-ko'ro-tsy-hͿ-na               mau'ru     'Ǌ-ki

          ‘with what money did you pay/buy?’Even though a verbal root preceding -tsy-hͿ retains its original valency, the en-
tire phrase can function as a dependent relative clause-like nominal (‘one with-
out an arm’) modifying a juxtaposed nominal head (‘shirt’):354.MA translated it in POR as fita de fuder ‘video tape of fucking’.
355.MA translated this in POR as fita de se matar o outro ‘video tape of killing one an-

          ‘car wheel’ (lit. ‘the thing being a car’s wheel’)With regard to the latter example, there is doubt about whether the possessor
possesses the derived stem or whether -tsy-hͿ nominalises the entire possessive
construction. The root of the possessum erirwa ‘disk’ could namely be a nomi-
nal stem, although this is not completely certain. This example also points to
another correspondence between -tse and -tsy-: bare nouns can be zero-derived
as verb stems by the application of a mood marker.356 Similarly then, -tsy-hͿ
can be applied to bare nominal stems. Also in the subsequent examples -tsy-hͿ
has an emphatic function:(3283)    e-ka'nİ-tsy-hͿ

          (lit. ‘annatto which has the form of powder’)If gerundial -tsy- is a verbal suffix, then a noun root terminated by -tsy-hͿ has
gone through a change of lexical category twice: zero-verbalisation and nomi-
nalisation.
    Sometimes, the gerundial morpheme -tsy- makes the impression of being an
equivalent of the attributive morpheme -Ϳ- (see 4.3.2.1.):(3287)    lowİ̘-'xu-Ϳ-hͿ                         tso'ro   e-'he-tsy-hͿ

          ‘the close one’                        ‘the closer one’However, the contrasted examples represent completely different constructions.
The most important formal difference between the two is that -Ϳ-, being only
optionally nominalised, can be followed immediately by a mood marker, ex-
cept by declarative -tse, while -tsy- is obligatorily nominalised before it can be
verbalised again by a declarative mood marker. Compare kãu-tse ‘it broke’ to
the following examples:(3289)    kãu-tsy-'hͿ                            kãu-tsy-'hͿ-ki
          break-GER-NOM                          break-GER-NOM-DEC

8.1.2.1. Gerundial -tsy- in the interrogativeOnly in the interrogative mood gerundial -tsy- is not nominalised. The present
subsection is partially based on (5.2.2.2.). As we have seen there, the inter-
rogative marker is attached to the zero-marked verb root in third person exam-
ples like the following (repeated from 1331):357.Traditionally, the Kwaza used the red paste from the seeds of annatto (Bixa orellana
    L.) for body decoration.

          who cut-INT
          ‘who is cutting (felling the tree)?’The element -tsy- may be inserted between subject cross-reference marking
(which is zero for the third person) and interrogative -re. No solid explanations
have been found with regard to its presence or absence. If there is a possibility
that gerundial -tsy- is related to declarative -tse, then -tsy- may have a similar
gerundial function in the interrogative:(3291)    'bwa-tse              ‘it is finished’
          'bwa-tsy-hͿ           ‘the/a finished one/finishing one’

          who coffee-CL:liquid drink=end-GER-INT
          ‘who drank all the coffee?’It may be worthwhile to observe how -tsy- is usually inserted between -re and
the negative marker:(3293)    atsile-'re                             atsile-'he-tsy-re
          heavy-INT                              heavy-NEG-GER-INT

          coati     flee-NEG-GER-INT
          ‘the coati has not escaped?’In a similar fashion, -tse usually replaces -ki after the negative marker -he- (and
after the future markers -nã- and -damͿ-). Although I see no compelling reason
to relate the potential modality marker -tsy- to declarative -tse and gerundial
-tsy-, it does have a similar distribution in certain interrogative constructions.
Compare the following examples (repeated from 1354) to (3290):(3295)    di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re                       di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re

          ‘who cut (the tree)?’                  ‘who is going to cut (the tree)?’The example in which -tsy- is analysed as gerundial has a past tense reading
when contrasted to present tense (3290) and to the potential construction which
has a future tense interpretation. It is unclear whether -tsy- is an allomorph of
declarative -tse in the third person interrogative or whether it is a different
morpheme. An important reason to distinguish potential -tsy- from the other
-tsy- (and from -tse) is that the potential -tsy- can be attached directly to overt

future:(3296)    o'ja-xa-tsy-re
          leave-2-POT-INT
          ‘you’re going?’    The semantic difference between interrogatives with and without gerundial
-tsy- is not predictable. Above in (3295) we saw a past interpretation of the
verb containing the -tsy- interrogative, but interrogatives without -tsy- may also
have a past tense reading:(3297)    dilİ-'wã 'mİ̘-re                    (3298)    txa'rwa oja-'re
          who-AO beat-INT                               first     leave-INT
          ‘he hit whom?’                                ‘he went today?’(3299)    o'ja-tsy-re
          leave-GER-INT
          ‘did he go?’Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that there is idiosyncratic and therefore
lexicalised difference between certain verbs with and without -tsy- in the inter-
rogative. However, the next examples do not seem to have any sharply con-
trasting meanings:(3300)    di'lİ               ‘who?’
          di'lİ-re            ‘who is there? (at the door)’
          di'le-tsy-re        ‘who is it?’(3301)    ja        hã'rã-(tsy)-re
          already stop-GER-INT
          ‘already stopped?’Unfortunately, the collected documentation does not provide for clearer exam-
ples and contrasts. Probably the function of gerundial -tsy- is to give an extra
cleft-like effect, like ‘who could it be who ...?’ or ‘what could it be that ...?’.
Note that in case of verb stem ellipsis, -re is usually preceded by -tsy-. In fact,
tsyre is often used as a free minimal response particle, with a potential conno-
tation of doubt: ‘is it?’, ‘would it be?’, ‘I don’t know’.","[646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657]"

78. The question whether a specific vowel in a certain word is phonemically nasal or
    oral was solved through comparing the number of occasions on which it occured as
    oral and as nasal. If it was nine out of ten times nasal, then I concluded it was pho-
    nemically nasal. In case of equal frequencies, I presented the consultant with both
    oral and nasal versions of that word and let him decide which pronunciation was
    best.

5.5.18.   Modal and aspectual uses of frustrative -le-In (8.2.2.2.) the antithetic adverbial clause marker -le-(hͿ)- was treated as a
frustrative subordinate mood marker. When applied to a matrix predicate in
combination with the nominaliser -hͿ-, the frustrative morpheme may add the
attitudinal modal sense of ‘unfortunately, a pity’ (see the examples in 8.2.2.2.).
When applied to a matrix predicate without -hͿ-, the frustrative morpheme may
also add the sense of ‘pity’, but more often there is a rather aspectual sense of
incompleteness or unrealisedness: ‘nearly, come close to’. Obviously these
functions are related to the frustrative adverbial clause mood. Here are some

         ‘I’m wanting to go to Zezinho’ (but I have not been there yet)In combination with procrastinative -tara-, the frustrative morpheme -le- means
probably ‘for the time being’. This will be illustrated by the examples (2225)
and (2226) in section (5.5.19.) below.
   The frustrative morpheme -le- also seems to have a more abstract aspectual
sense of interrupted continuity or arrested progression. The nominaliser -hͿ-
seems optional. In the following example, the progressive sense is revealed by
reduplication of the verb root:(2199)   hoi    kwİ-nİ=kwİ-nİ-'le-tsy-hͿ

         I drink-1S-NOM-DEC        water             water drink-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘I’ve drunk water’                          ‘I’ve drunk water’(2203)   si 'kui-da-le-hͿ-ki               hã
         I drink-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC          water
         ‘I was drinking water’Example (2202) is not subject to a progressive interpretation. In example
(2203), there is such an interpretation, albeit interrupted progression. Appar-
ently, then, explicit progressive marking is not always required in order to ex-
press its interruption by -le-. When no other progressive marking exists, -le-
has both a progressive sense and the interruption of that progression. The same
observations can be made with respect to the following pair of examples:(2204)   tsǊhǊ-'du 'hu-xa-re           (2205)      tsǊhǊ-'du 'hu-xa-le-re
         what-BER give-2-INT                       what-BER give-2-FRUST-INT
         ‘why did you give?’                       ‘why were you giving?’The following examples represent instances of similar interruptions of implicit
progression:(2206)   hã'rã-xa-le-ki                (2207)      mƭu      'kui-le-ki
         stop-2-FRUST-DEC                          chicha drink-FRUST-DEC
         ‘you were stopping’                       ‘he was drinking chicha’
                                                   (once by one person)(2208)   Q: ti-'rjͿ       o'ja-xa-re         A: o'kja-da-le-ki
            what-CD:area go-2-INT               hunt-1S-FRUST-DEC
            ‘where were you?’                   ‘I was out hunting’
                                                (S is returning from the forest)More examples can be found in (8.2.2.2.).
   When the predicate is habitual, by way of ƭ?ƭta- ‘as always’ (see 5.5.24.),
and marked by remote past, the frustrative -le- does not indicate that the habit-
ual is cancelled:(2209)   txa'hͿ ba-jãhͿ-ƭ?ƭ-le-'hͿ-ki
         path      clear-CL:path-REM-FRUST-NOM-DEC
         ‘he usually cleared the road’ (after breakfast last summer) (TMA:20)
434   5. The verb phrase(2210)    ba-jãhͿ=ƭ?ƭ'ta-ƭ?ƭ-le-'hͿ-ki
          clear-CL:path=always-REM-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘he usually cleared the road’ (after breakfast last summer and he may
          be still doing it) (TMA:20)   In the interrogative, a frustrative interpretation does not seem to be always
neccessary. The following example can be interpreted in several different ways
according to the pragmatic context:(2211)    ti-'nãi-xa-le-re
          what-NOM-2-FRUST-INT
          ‘where did you go?’, ‘where were you?”,
          ‘how/what did you say/were you saying?’With some effort, the free translations can be related to an originally frustrative
interpretation. However, (2211) can also be used in the sense of ‘how are
you?’. In the following set of examples, no frustrative interpretation was at-
tested at all:(2212)    da'rje-xa-re                  (2213)     da'rje-xa-le-re
          strong-2-INT                             strong-2-FRUST-INT
          ‘are you fast? / do you walk fast?’      ‘are you fine/healthy/strong?’Maybe such utterances represent idiomatic expressions in which a friendly
question about someone’s well-being is posed in the form of something like an
interrupted habitual.","[469, 470, 471, 472]"

4.3.1. PossessiveOne important form of nominal modification is possessive modification.
Kwaza has no possessive pronouns. The possessor- the modifier in the Kwaza
possessive construction- is a personal pronoun or a noun. These constructions
require a derivational possessive morpheme -dy-, which must be applied to the
possessor and which must be followed by a classifier, usually the nominaliser
-hͿ, which functions as a semantically neutral classifier. Some examples are:(657) 'si-dy-hͿ ecǊi'ri            (658) 'si-dy-hͿ   'kopu ko-'ro-tse
      I-POS-NOM buttock                  I-POS-NOM cup without-CL:cup-DEC
      ‘my buttock’                       ‘my cup is empty’111(659) ko-'ro-tse             'xyi-dy-hͿ 'kopu
      without-CL:cup-DEC you-POS-NOM cup
      ‘your cup is empty’112(660) 'kopu 'ƭ-dy-hͿ           ko-'ro-tse
      cup he-POS-NOM           without-CL:cup-DEC
      ‘his cup is empty’111.The phrase is ungrammatical with -ki ‘DEC’.
112.The order 231 is also possible.
182    4. The noun phrase(661) 'si-dy-hͿ-ki         'kopu          (662) 'si-dy-hͿ    'kopu-ki

                                                       hole’ (not lo'ne ‘hole’!)(665) lu'zeu-dy-hͿ        ko'sa hyri-'ty-da-ki
      Luzeu-POS-NOM sun steal-DET-1S-DEC
      ‘I stole Luzeu’s lantern / from Luzeu’As seen in example (661), the dependent noun may be verbalised: 'sidyhͿki ‘it
is mine’. In the proper discourse context the head noun may be omitted: 'sidyhͿ
‘mine’. Note the following example:(666) na-'ay-hͿ-dy-hͿ               i'si-ki
      PROX-that-NOM-POS-NOM         die-DEC
      ‘that person’s (son) has died’Case marking in the following example shows that the possessive construction
functions as a single noun phrase in the sentence:(667) 'si-dy-hͿ   etay-'wã     duky'ri-da-ki
      I-POS-NOM woman-AO long-1S-DEC
      ‘I’m longing for my wife’   Instead of the nominaliser -hͿ in the function of a neutral classifier, other,
semantically specific classifiers may be encountered in possessive construc-
tions as well. They were amply discussed in the previous section on classifiers,
so I will limit the evidence here to only few examples:(668) 'si-dy-ro      'dai-xa-ki           (669) 'si-dy-mãi
      I-POS-CL:cup grab-2-DEC                   I-POS-CL:tooth
      ‘you took my cup’                         ‘my teeth’   The combination of these possibilities, the omission of the head noun and
the use of a classifier, allows for two alternative possessive expressions, which
are equivalent in meaning and context-(in)dependence:
113.Order 21 is also possible.
                                                   4.3. Attributive modification   183(670) maga'riDa-dy-hͿ    e-'xyi                /   maga'riDa-dy-'xyi

      ‘Margarida’s hair’(671) di'lİ-dy-hͿ    a'xy                      /   di'lİ-dy-xy (a'xy)
      who-POS-NOM house                        /   who-POS-CL:house (house)
      ‘whose house?’In both examples, the first alternative is an analytic expression involving the
neutral classifier (see 4.2.) and the second alternative is a synthetic headless
construction involving a specific classifier. Here is an example of the latter in a
sentential context:(672) di'lİ-dy-xy          wai-dy-'hͿ-xa-re
      who-POS-CL:house good-CAU-NOM-2-INT
      ‘whose house are you repairing?’   The possessive morpheme -dy- is homophonous with the benefactive mor-
pheme -dy-, but it has a different distribution and behaviour. It forms a root that
neither exists independently as a nominal stem, nor can it form a verb stem like
the benefactive does:(673) 'si-dy-hͿ        /      *si-dy    /   *(kopu) si-dy-ki
      I-POS-NOM        /      I-POS     /   (cup) I-POS-DEC
      ‘mine’We have seen in examples (661) and (662) that concomitants of the possessive
construction can be verbalised through e.g. the declarative marker -ki:(674) 'si-dy-hͿ kanwa=ekai-'e           (675) si-dy-'hͿ-ki         kanwa=ekai-'e
      I-POS-NOM canoe=leg-too                 I-POS-NOM-DEC canoe=leg-too
      ‘my car’                                ‘it is my car/the car is mine’During elicitation sessions in fieldwork doubt was expressed by MA at the
grammaticality of the non-verbalised possessor as an answer two an open
question, like to: ‘whose car is that?’, A: *?'marjudyhͿ ‘Mario’s’ instead of
marjudy'hͿki ‘it is Mario’s’.
   Other verbal moods than the declarative are also possible. Note that in some
of the following interrogative examples, word order is reversed apparently
without semantic consequences:(676) e'tay 'xyi-dy-hͿ-re                   (677) 'xyi-dy-hͿ-re e'tay
      wife I-POS-NOM-INT                          I-POS-NOM-INT wife

      I-POS-NOM wife-INT
      ‘is she your wife?’Here are some further examples:(679) Q: di'lİ-dy-ro-re                       (680) A: 'si-dy-ro-ki

      ‘whose is it?’                                ‘whose house is it?’Note that not with all pronouns the possessive morpheme -dy- is possible, that
is, not with the pronoun txana ‘we.IN’:(683) txana(*-dy)-'hͿ-ki          'kopo       (684) 'kopo txana-'ro-ki
      we.IN(-POS)-NOM-DEC cup                       cup we.IN-CL:cup-DEC
      ‘it is our cup/the cup is ours’               ‘it is our cup/the cup is ours’114(685) İ-'ja      txana-'rjͿ
      go-EXP we.IN-CD:area
      ‘let’s go to our place!’An explanation for the behaviour of txana is that it is of Tupi-Guarani origin,
unlike the other pronouns. All other pronouns require -dy-, although TE re-
jected also the combination of the possessive morpheme with xyitsİ ‘you.PL’:115(686) tsyitsİ(*-dy)-'hͿ-ki 'kopo
      you.PL(-POS)-NOM-DEC cup
      ‘it is your cup’   In headless possessive constructions which contain a classifier and which
refer to animal body parts, the possessive morpheme -dy- is often, but not al-
ways, optional. The resulting construction is one of noun classification as de-
scribed in (4.2.1.9.):114.Once I ventured *kopo txana-dy-ro-ki ‘our cup’ wherupon MA said in Portuguese:
    'ta certo, mas não existe ‘It’s correct, but it doesn’t exist’.
115.This is probably caused by uncertainty on the part of TE. Notice in this respect that
    TE also pronounced the second person plural pronoun differently from normal xy-
    i'tsİ: [tsÓitsİ] probably in analogy with tsitsİ ‘we.EX’.

      ‘toucan beak’No evidence was found that -dy- is optional in similar constructions which in-
volve body parts of humans.
   Possessive constructions can be embedded in other possessive construc-
tions. The embedding possessor possesses the embedded possessor:(693) 'xyi-dy-'hͿ    'mã-dy-'hͿ  a'xy
      you-POS-NOM mother-POS-NOM house
      ‘your mother’s house’As was demonstrated earlier, it is possible to express an object of possession
synthetically through a specific classifier. The resulting headless construction
can be an object of possession itself, but again, only the embedded possessor is
possessed:(694) 'xyi-dy-hͿ     'mã-dy-'rjͿ
      you-POS-NOM mother-POS-CD:area
      ‘your mother’s place’   There are neither possessive pronouns nor possessive inflexion in Kwaza.
There is only one denominal-nominal morpheme, -tjate, which marks a noun as
possessed by a third person possessor:(695) 'kopu-tjate ko-'ro-tsİ
      cup-3.POS without-CL:cup-DEC
      ‘his cup is empty’
186   4. The noun phraseThis morpheme will be discussed under other nominal morphological catego-
ries in section (4.4.1.).
    The possessive morpheme also occurs in combination with the factive
nominaliser -nãi. The result is not a grammatically possessive construction, but
an adverbial complement with the meaning ‘the language of’:(696) aika'nã-dy-nãi     areta-'he-da-ki
      Aikanã-POS-NOM know-NEG-1S-DEC
      ‘I don’t understand Aikanã’The fact that the morpheme -dy- is preferably omitted in the context of the in-
clusive pronoun suggests that it is originally a possessive morpheme:(697) txana(*?-dy)-'nãi
      we.IN-POS-NOM
      ‘our language’The phenomenon of omission of possessive -dy- was also encountered in the
examples (683) to (684) above. Another indication that -dy- is originally a pos-
sessive morpheme comes from the next example:(698) ti-'nãi-hͿ        de'da-dy-nãi           Ǌce'nãi-xa-re
      what-NOM-NOM anaconda-POS-NOM know-2S-INT
      ‘do you know that story about the snake?’ (t)Here, -nãi probably marks a complement clause. The -dy-nãi construction is
treated further in (6.2.4.2.). The morpheme -nãi is discussed exhaustively in
(5.6.2.) and (8.4.2.).
    Apart from the constructions involving -dy- and -tjate, there are no other
grammatical ways to express possession in Kwaza. Lexical alternatives involve
the verb e- ‘have’, as in:(699) xyi'ni 'e-ki                        (700) e-wa-hͿ-ki
      thorn have-DEC                            have-IS-NOM-DEC
      ‘it has thorns’                           ‘it is someone’s’Furthermore, there is a way of speaking in which a possessor can be “under-
stood”, and by that, the whole notion of possession:(701) exyi'co he'we-da-ki esiki-'na
      feather put-1S-DEC skin-LOC
      ‘I put feathers as ornaments on (my) clothes’
                                                 4.3. Attributive modification   1874.3.2. Attributive (adjective)Attributive constructions in Kwaza are structurally identical to other noun
modification constructions like the possessive. A noun or nominalised verb
with an attributive sense can be juxtaposed to the (optional) head noun which it
modifies. Also verbs with non-attributive meaning can be nominalised and ob-
tain an attributive sense through juxtaposition. It depends on the specific verbal
root or stem which type of nominalisation is involved. In a number of situations
the insertion of a special attributive morpheme -Ϳ- is required. In this section, I
will discuss all non-possessive noun-noun attributive constructions.
    The simplest attributive construction consists of juxtaposed bare nouns:(702) ywy'nwͿ duma'ru             (703) koreja'ri amǊ'tay
      tree     ladle                    plate     glass

      ‘male duck’                         ‘shaman João is treating (someone)’Many nouns contain verb stems, nominalisers and classifiers, either lexicalised
as in (706) and (707), or not:(706) wade-'xyi      bu-ni'te       (707) auxwa'na 'ke-ni'te

      ‘a big cockroach’                          ‘big star’Attributive constructions may consist of multiple juxtaposed nouns:(711) tã'jã wade-'xyi         bu-ni'te    wai-'hͿ-hͿ           'e-ki
      chief tucuma-CL:hair put-INSTR good-NOM-NOM have-DEC
      ‘the chief has a beautiful hat made of the fibre of tucuma’The maximum seems to lie around four juxtaposed nouns. In the following ex-
ample, there was no room for wai'hͿhͿ ‘beautiful’ any more:
188   4. The noun phrase(712) axe'hͿ-da-ki     tã'jã wade-'xyi       bu-ni'te     'bu-hͿ
      find-1S-DEC      chief tucuma-CL:hair put-INSTR put-NOM
      ‘I met the chief wearing a hat made of fibre of tucuma’   There is no difference in Kwaza between nominalisation and relative clause
formation. Nominalised verbs can be finite and juxtaposed to a noun, which
may be the underlying object of the verb stem:(713) a'ru-xy-nite          awͿi-'ja-da-day-hͿ
      cross-CL:leaf-INSTR see-IO-1S-1S-NOM

      thing      sting-IO-NOM have-DEC
      ‘there is an animal which bites (CX: inside the box)’Like any other noun modification construction a “relative clause” can be head-
less:(717) 'kui-da-hͿ         txu'hǊi-tse
      drink-1S-NOM small-DEC
      ‘I drank little’ (that which I drank was little)A “relative clause” can be verbalised again which results in a cleft-like con-
struction:(718) jo-ka'nİ     txitxi-'dy-da-hͿ-ki
      manioc-bar fry-CAU-1S-NOM-DEC
      ‘they’re pieces of manioc which I fried’(719) ay-'hͿ       wai-'hͿ-Ϳ-rydy-hͿ-tse
      that-NOM good-NOM-ATT-IRR-NOM-DEC

unclear so far whether there are other connotations involved in the application

clauses” are further discussed as attributive clauses in (8.4.1.).

from relatively remote to the first days of mankind:(1946)    ja        a'nǊ-ƭ?ƭ-hͿ-ki        atxi'txi

          ‘it’s been a long time since the hawk grabbed (chickens)’   Apparently, the remote past morpheme is applied before argument cross-
reference, whereas the nominaliser -hͿ- may occur in alternative positions:(1950)    etohoi-ƭ?ƭ-'hͿ-a-xa-ki
          child-REM-NOM-1P-AS-DEC
          ‘we were children’(1951)    etohoi-ƭ?ƭ-a-xa-a-xa-le-'hͿ-ki

          ‘he talked / he was talking’                ‘he (has) talked’ (once)   Apparently, -ƭ?ƭ- does not occur as the only verb root-extending bound mor-
pheme on the predicate:(1954)    *kui-ƭ?ƭ-(da)-ki
          drink-REM-1S-DEC

mood marking it refers to a noun:(1955)    'xyi-dy-hͿ    eto'hoi-ƭ?ƭ-hͿ     tsa'si-hͿ-tsy
          you-POS-NOM child-REM-NOM follow-NOM-RES
          ‘he who was once your son came after you, you fool!’ (t)   The following examples range from relatively not very remote past to an-
cient:(1956)    segunDafera-'wy                  (1957)    segunDafera-ƭ?ƭ-'wy

          hunt-REM-COL
          ‘those hunters of the past (of olden times)’   Although the consultant claimed that ƭ?ƭ-hͿ-ki did not occur as an independ-
ent word, it may have occurred as such on several occasions in texts. It was
possible to ask about it in isolation, and he explained that it meant ‘it took a
long time’, ‘it was’, or ‘in the past’.
   The element -ƭ?ƭ-hͿ does not always have a temporal meaning. In the fol-
lowing little dialogue it marks an indignated reply:(1961)    R:     hã'?ã kurakura-'ni           A:     haki'dwa-ƭ?ƭ-hͿ

5.5.4. Remote past by cross-reference reduplication and -hӻSection (7.3.) deals with reduplication as a phonotactically determined process
with grammatical or lexical functions. However, there is also a type of redupli-
cation in Kwaza that could be thought of rather as a morphologically deter237.Or in POR: é pedra, uai!
                                                5.5. Tense, modality and aspect   393mined process with grammatical functions. Whereas reduplication as discussed
in section (7.3.) can involve repetition of either entire lexical content bearing
roots, or of root syllables that have no distinguishable meaning or function of
themselves, in the present section the reduplication of bound person markers in
the verbal complex, which have a grammatical meaning, is discussed. This sort
of reduplication was also the topic of a separate article by van der Voort
(2003). To my knowledge, it has not been attested in any other language.
   A rare instance of this kind of reduplication was already shown in (5.5.2.),
where a past tense construction may involve reduplication of a bound person
marker. The remote past construction discussed here appears to be much more
productive.
   The reduplication of bound argument cross-reference morphemes followed
by -hͿ- creates a sense of remote past. Here, some reduplicated person markers
have a slightly different form. First person singular -da- is expressed by its al-
lomorph -day- in certain positions, second person -xa- by -xay-, first person
plural subject -a- by -ay-, first person singular object -ta- becomes -tay- and in-
definite subject -cwa- (itself an allomorph of -wa-) becomes -cu-, -ci- or -ti-.
Note the following examples:(1962)    xyi mã-xa-'xay-hͿ-ki
          you call-2-2-NOM-DEC
          ‘you have given him (your son) his name’ (t)(1963)    tutunita'hͿ-ti-cwa-hͿ-ki
          think-IS-IS-NOM-DEC
          ‘in olden times they worried a lot’(1964)    txarwa-wy-te'te     'a-ci-cwa-wy were=oja-'tay
          first-time-really   exist-IS-IS-time revolt=go-CL:woman          ‘ta-ci-cwa-nahere 'a-ƭ?ƭ-wy
          talk-IS-IS-COL      exist-REM-time
          ‘it was at the time of those people of the very first time, which they
          called “the rebellious runaway women”‘ (t)For -cu- as an allomorph of -cwa-, see example (1987). Apparently, the exclu-
sive realisation of the first person plural does not have a special allomorph for
reduplication:(1965)    aure-lİ-'nã-a-xa-a-xa-le-hͿ-ki
          marry-RECI-FUT-1P-AS-1P-AS-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘we were going to marry (but we didn’t)’A possible explanation for this is that the first person plural exclusive consists
of two separate morphemes. Another explanation could lie in the fact that the
394   5. The verb phraseassociated person marker is a different type of morpheme. No instances of sec-
ond person plural reduplication have been documented.
    Compare the following examples, and note that there is obviously no redu-
plication when a zero-marked third person subject is involved:(1966)   na-ay-'wy         o'nİ-da-day-hͿ-ki
         PROX-that-time arrive-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘I arrived at that time’(1967)   na-ay-'wy        o'nİ-hͿ-ki
         PROX-that-time arrive-NOM-DEC
         ‘he arrived at that time’Note that the proximate prefix na- in these examples indicates proximity in the
discourse, and not temporal proximity.
   In view of the different status of object markers, it is remarkable that one of
them, the first person object marker -ta- can be reduplicated, namely by the al-
lomorph -tay-, as if it were somehow part of the subject marking paradigm:(1968)   tsǊhǊ-'du 'si-dy-hͿ       e'tay a'sa-ta-tay-'hͿ-re
         what-BER I-POS-NOM woman leave-1O-1O-NOM-INT
         ‘what a pity my wife left me!’   Remote past seems to be the main function of argument cross-reference re-
duplication followed by -hͿ-. Compare (1969) to example (1940) above, and
compare example (1970) to (1971):(1969)   nǊ'ri-xa-'xay-hͿ-re
         satiate-2-2-NOM-INT
         ‘were you satiated?’ (one week up to three months ago)(1970)   la'to        o'ja-da-hͿ-ki      ze'zƭju-dy-rjͿ

         ‘it has been a long time I was there. I haven’t been there since’   Apparently, the remote past needs to be expressed only once in a sentence,
on the matrix predicate:(1972)   'xa-ta   'Ǌi-xa-ta    İ-'e-xa-xay-hͿ-ki
         2-CSO lie-2-CSO go-again-2-2-NOM-DEC
         ‘then you slept, and went away again’ (long ago)

         a) ‘because I liked her, I married her’
         b) ‘I made love to her and I married her’    The remote past construction may have a perfect connotation, and the frus-
trative morpheme may emphasise the notion that the situation described by the
verb does not obtain anymore in the present:(1974)   aure-lİ-'nã-da-day-hͿ-ki
         marry-RECI-FUT-1S-1S-NOM-DEC

         Barroso-LOC exist-1S-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
         ‘I lived in Barroso’ (but now not any more)   The remote past is often combined with temporal adverbs:(1977)   jale'ja      aniwesario-'dy-da-day-hͿ-ki
         in.the.past birthday-CAU-1S-1S-NOM-DEC

         that-time still      exist-NEG-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘at that time I was not living here’    In combination with the adverbial perfect particle ja ‘already’, the interpre-
tation of the remote past construction is what Dahl (1985:132) calls the “perfect
of persistent situation”:(1979)   ja        'a-da-day-hͿ-ki        Ba'roso-'na
         already exist-1S-1S-NOM-DEC Barroso-LOC

         already marry-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘I’m already married’Summarising, one could state that the combination of reduplicated person
marking and nominalisation creates a sense of remote past. Since this construc

is no reason to regard the reduplication it contains as iconic.","[428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434]"

5.5.19.4. Tentative conclusionFor the time being, I have considered -tara- and -tjara- as variants of the same
modal/aspectual suffix. It may be that both are fossilisations of formerly dis-
continuous elements in a fixed type of expression containing a modal verb.
   In the following table I give an overview of the distributional and semantic
properties of -tara-, according to their order of occurrence in the discussions
above, with reference to primary examples.

5.5.20.   TMA effects of nominaliser -hӻIn (4.2.2.1.) and (5.6.1.) the nominaliser and neutral classifier -hͿ is discussed
extensively. When a nominalised verb is zero-verbalised again (see 4.4.9.), it
can be regarded as a cleft predicate:(2278)    a'xy nͿ-'xy-ki                   (2279)    a'xy nͿ-'xy-hͿ-ki
          house big-CL:house-DEC                     house big-CL:house-NOM-DEC
          ‘the house is big’                         ‘the house is a big one’
          (visible) (TMA:1)                          (invisible) (TMA:2;4)When one asks about any possible difference in meaning between examples
like these, the consultants often maintain that there is no difference whatso-
ever.260 On other occasions, the consultant explained that the application of -hͿ-
makes the utterance “stronger” than without -hͿ-:
260.The difference between (2278) and (2279) coincides with a difference in visibility of
    the house. This is in accordance with the contexts in Dahl’s (1985:198) TMA ques-
    tionnaire, with the aid of which these examples were elicited. However, the corre-
    spondence between -hͿ- and invisibility has not been corroborated as being system-
    atic by other examples.
446   5. The verb phrase(2280)    a'wͿi-da-ki                  (2281)   awͿi-da-'hͿ-ki
          see-1S-DEC                            see-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘I saw it’                            ‘I saw it’ (‘stronger than (2280)’)Furthermore, some examples equivalent to (2279) were shown in (4.2.2.1.) to
have actually a comparative or superlative sense. On some rare occasions,
predicates with an embedded nominaliser -hͿ- were indeed translated as (rela-
tivised) cleft constructions:(2282)    'e-wa-hͿ-ki
          have-IS-NOM-DEC
          ‘it is someone’s’(2283)    jo-ka'nİ            txitxi-'dy-da-hͿ-ki
          manioc-CL:oblong fry-CAU-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘they are pieces of manioc which I fried’261Finally, the impression is that this kind of “clefting” may have the side-effect
of a past tense reading or progressive aspect or both. This will be elaborated
upon in the following subsections.
5.5.20.1. past interpretation of -hͿIn (5.5.1.) we have seen that the distinction between past and present is not
obligatorily marked morphologically. Nevertheless, the general impression is
that predicates with a past or perfective sense more often seem to bear the suf-
fix -hͿ than present tense predicates do. The suffix occurs between the argu-
ment cross-reference morpheme and the mood marker:(2284)    'kui-da-ki      hã             (2285)       'kui-da-hͿ-ki           hã

          ‘I drank/drink/am drinking water’           ‘I drank water’(2286)    si wara'ñͿ-da-ki                  (2287)    si wara'ñͿ-da-hͿ-'ki

    manioc which I fried’.

          someone you meet on the road)               (some time ago)Sometimes, when contrasting a sentence marked by -hͿ with a zero-marked
sentence, the consultant indicated that the former refers to any past, whereas
the latter refers either to present or immediate past. The “perfect” adverb ja ‘al-
ready’ (see 5.5.22.) ensures that we are dealing with past events in the follow-
ing sentences:(2292)    ja        'kui-da-ki      hã
          already drink-1S-DEC water
          ‘I already drank water (just now)’(2293)    ja        'kui-da-hͿ-ki          hã
          already drink-1S-NOM-DEC water
          ‘I already drank water (earlier on, 1 day, 2 weeks)’It may be a telling fact that canonical remote past marking always involves -hͿ.
One of the ways to express remote past is through reduplication of the person
cross-reference marker followed by -hͿ (see also 5.5.4.):(2294)    (txa'rwa)    axe'hͿ-da-(hͿ)-ki       (2295)     axe'hͿ-da-day-'hͿ-ki
          first        meet-1S-NOM-DEC                    meet-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘I met him’ (just a minute ago)                 ‘I met him’ (long ago)
          (TMA:38;46;49)                                  (TMA:39;40;43;44;48)Also the past marker -ky- (see 5.5.2.) and the remote past marker -ƭ?ƭ- (see
5.5.3.) never fail to cooccur with the element -hͿ.
   But with recent and/or immediate past, -hͿ is optional. Meanwhile past can
be explicitated by an adverb:(2296)    la'to        kui-da-('hͿ)-ki
          yesterday drink-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘I drank yesterday’  On some occasions, -hͿ was considered as obligatory in a past sentence.
Compare the following example to (1936):(2297)    txa'hͿ ba-jã'hͿ-hͿ-ki                  (*txahͿ bajãhͿki)
          path     clear-CL:path-NOM-DEC
          ‘he was clearing the road’ (yesterday after dinner) (TMA:13)
448   5. The verb phraseThe context which pertains to this example is the question ‘what did your
brother do after you had dinner together yesterday?’. The past tense contexts in
which -hͿ- was optional were: ‘what was your brother doing when you visited
him yesterday?’ (TMA:9) and ‘what was your brother doing when you tele-
phoned him yesterday?’ (TMA:11). The difference between the context of
(2297) and these is probably that (2297) can be interpreted as obligatorily du-
rative or progressive, whereas in the other ones this is optional.","[482, 483, 484, 485, 486]"

6.2.2. Reduplication in adverbsAdverbs can be extended by full repetition of the adverbial root (see also
7.3.1.). The semantic effect is emphasis or intensification of the meaning origi-
nal adverb:(2639)   wa'txi zjwãu         hy'ja-re
         true     João        fall-INT
         ‘has João really fallen?’(2640)   watxi-wa'txi     ãwͿi-'ra
         true-true        see-IMP
         ‘aim right!’, ‘look well!’Reduplication of an adverb can also have a repetitive effect:(2641)   haja-ha'ja
         day-day
         ‘every day’This is not possible with similar temporal adverbs: *hakorehakore.
   Partial reduplication of the adverb txarwa ‘first, now, today’ may go to-
gether with the intensifying suffix -te. Compare the following examples:(2642)   txa'rwa 'a-da-hͿ-ki                 Ϳ-hͿ-'ko
         first     exist-1S-NOM-DEC          this-NOM-LOC

         RED.first-INTENS    stop-DEC    maize        plant-NOM
         ‘he’s just stopped planting maize’The suffix -te, which can be reduplicated itself, is discussed further down be-
low. The partial reduplication in haja'jadyko're ‘tomorrow early’ was discussed
under (2606).
   Some adverbs were only attested in a partially reduplicated form, such as
harehareja'wyle ‘(only) after a (long) time’ or ‘just a little while later’:(2644)   sa'mweu aha-tja'te-dynͿ           'a=a-ta
         Samuel father-3POS-COMIT          exist=exist-CSO         harehareja'wyle axe-'rjͿ-tse
         long.while        find-CD:area-DEC
         ‘Samuel lived together with his parents until he found a place of his
         own’The root of this adverb harejawy, in which the suffix -wy ‘time’ can be dis-
cerned, was translated by the consultant as ‘late, slow, belated, retarded’ but it
was not considered as an independent word. However, the element -le, which
probably means ‘only, just’ here, was omitted in one instance, and the redupli-
cation involved an even smaller part of the root:(2645)   harereja'wy     tsa'si-ki
         long.while      follow-DEC
         ‘it took him long to come’, ‘he is the last one’
6.2.3. Other categories used as adverbsFor other categories to function as adverbs, specific morphological operations
are usually required. As is demonstrated elsewhere (4.4.9.), the possibilities of
zero-derivation in Kwaza allow for many lexical roots to be ambiguous with
regard to their grammatical category. However, there is only a very small num-
ber of adverbs which are ambiguous in this respect. Some words used as ad-
verbs may actually be nouns, for example because they end in a classifier.
Other words used as adverbs may be uninflected verb roots but their original
status is difficult to prove.
    Some bare nouns have been attested to function as adverbs, e.g. teja ‘(oppo-
site) side of a place (river, settlement, road)’:(2646)   'si-dy-hͿ te'ja     (2647)    na-ay-xu'ko         te'ja 'a-ki
         I-POS-NOM side                PROX-that-SETT      side exist-DEC
         ‘my side’                     ‘he lives on the same side of the river’

         begin-1P-AS-1P-AS-NOM-DEC Barroso side
         ‘we started on the side/part/region of Barroso’ (t)If teja would function as a locative satellite, it would have been marked with
the locative morpheme -na. As this is not the case, and because teja is clearly
not an argument of the verb, its function may be considered as adverbial in
these examples.
    The noun kohͿtİ ‘thing without (something)’ is a classified nominalisation
of the verb root ko- ‘to be without (something)’. It is regarded as a noun in the
present analysis, but in the following construction it may be regarded as having
both a nominal argument function and an adverbial modification function:(2650)   wa'txi ko-hͿ-'tİ                  kui-'nã-tsy-re
         true       without-NOM-NOM        drink-FUT-GER-INT
         ‘is he really going to drink (coffee) without (sugar)?’In the next example there is no doubt that kohͿtİ functions as an adverb, or,
rather, the head of an adverbial clause:(2651)   ma'telu ko-hͿ-'tİ                   hu'hui-da-ki
         hammer without-NOM-NOM              beat-1S-DEC
         ‘I hit him without a hammer’The adverbial in (2651) has a negative instrumental sense, and cannot be inter-
preted as an argument in the form of a relative clause, like ‘I hit him who was
without a hammer’.
   Although the origin of the root of the apparent adverb dako'ro ‘left’ is un-
clear, its extension -koro ‘arm’ is otherwise a productive classifier. The proper
use of this adverb is not well documented, but the following example shows
that it cannot function as an adjective, though other nouns normally do:(2652)   *dako'ro     e'cǊi
         left         eye
         ‘left eye’   Other adverbs ending in classifiers are based on nominal roots but they
contain directionals such as -rja- ‘rim’ (see 5.3.3.) in the following examples:
                                                     6.2. Adverbial morphology     503(2653)    mãreri'tsa a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki     xyi-dy-rja-'xy

          ‘he hid himself behind a tree’If these nouns would not function as adverbs, but as locative arguments of the
verb, they would have been marked with locative case. These adverbs do not
differ structurally from those discussed in (6.2.1.), which are based on the
empty adverbial root a- and which contain directionals and which end in a clas-
sifier, such as e.g. (2625).
    Demonstratives and question roots ending in the classifier -rjͿ ‘area’ are
considered as nouns in the present analysis.282 Although they often function as
locative objects, they do not usually bear the corresponding locative or instru-
mental case marker. Hence, their use can be considered as adverbial:(2655)    (ja-)Ϳ-'rjͿ        oja-'ra
          DIST-this-CD:area  go-IMP
          ‘you have to go there!’(2656)    ti-'rjͿ        İ-'nã-xa-re             Ba'hoso-na      İ-'nã-da-ki

          Q: ‘where are you going?’              A: ‘I’m going to Barroso’Some instances were attested where other constructions terminated by -rjͿ did
not allow the locative case either.(2657)    ze'zƭju-dy-rjͿ(*-nã)         co-'hͿ a-'ki kuraku'ra
          Zezinho-POS-CD:area(-LOC) many-NOM exist-DECchicken
          ‘there are many chickens at Zezinho’s’Nevertheless, similar instances were attested in (4.6.3.) where the locative case
marker was allowed.
   Also demonstratives ending in -(xu)ko may function as adverbs (see the ex-
amples in 4.6.3.).
   Because independent stems of whatever categorial status can be easily zero-
verbalised, it is not entirely certain whether the adverbs discussed in the fol-
lowing are originally verb roots or whether their possible use as verb roots is
the result of productive verbalisation. The root of the verb habui-ki ‘it is out-
side of the house’ is used as an adverb in the following example:282.The hypothesis that these words are nouns is corroborated by many data presented in
    section (4.6.) on demonstratives and section (4.2.) on classifiers.

following examples show its use respectively as a verb stem, as a nominalised
attributivisation, as an adverbial modifier of the verbal stem of a noun and as
an adverb:(2660)     tja?a'tje-tse              (2661)     tja?a'tje-Ϳ-hͿ

as a verbal root:(2664)     txu'hǊi-tse (*txu'hǊiki)         (2665)     'kui-da-hͿ       txu'hǊi-tse

parently it may occur as a second element in a verb compound:(2675)    wai=txu'hǊi-tse                   (2676)      nͿ-hͿ=txu'hǊi-tse

          ‘I’m going to visit people a little’          ‘nearly killed (him)’Although compounds in Kwaza usually only involve verb stems, this seems a
rather illegitimate criterion for regarding txuhǊi as a verb root, since txuhǊi is
also attested as a noun modifier in a construction that is probably a nominal
compound:(2679)    jerexwa=txu'hǊi                   jere'xwa-tohoi

          I-POS-NOM cord=little
          ‘my piece of rope’    Canonical verb compounding in Kwaza may create serial verb-like con-
structions (see 7.4.1.). Depending on the semantic contents of the verb roots in-
volved, compounding can have an adverbial effect. In the following examples,
the first element in the compound is the attributive verbal root darje- ‘to be
strong, quick’:(2681)    darje=hyhy'rwa-ki                 (2682)      da'rje=ja-ra

506   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressionsHowever, note that darje- may also be used as an adverb:(2683)    hyhy'rwa-da-mͿ darje
          move-1S-VOL         strong
          ‘I want to walk fast’In the present analysis, darje- is regarded as compounded because it also oc-
curs as a single inflected verb root, and because no distributional variation as as
wide as with txuhǊi was observed, like in (2680).
   The verb root takaisa- ‘traverse, divide’ was also encountered as an adverb:(2684)    ze'zƭju Ǌtİ'ja takai'sa 'a-ki
          Zezinho side traverse exist-DEC
          ‘Zezinho lives on the other side of the river’(2685)    aruu-'nã-da-ki     Ǌtİ'ja takai'sa
          cross-FUT-1S-DEC side traverse
          ‘I’m going to cross to the other side’One could argue that takaisa- is the first element of a verbal compound in
(2684), but this is impossible in (2685). In both examples it could be the second
element in a compound with the noun Ǌtİja ‘(opposite) side of an object (head,
body, house)’. However, noun-verb compounds are very rare, if they exist at
all.
     The verb stem acwadyhͿ- ‘to force (someone to do something)’ looks as if it
contains bound morphemes. Indeed, the element -dy- is causative and can be
preceded by reflexive -nͿ-, if necessary. However, the nominaliser -hͿ- is
obligatory and the root does not occur as a verb stem itself: *acwa-ki. In order
to modify the matrix verb in a complete sentence acwadyhͿ- does usually not
occur as a subordinate clause, but it is simply not inflected, and acts as an ad-
verb:(2686)    zjwãu samwe-'wã a'cwadyhͿ mǊi-'dy-ki

compounded verb root.

5.5.28.   Temporary contrast ihƭ-There is a verb root ihƭ- ‘on the contrary, it isn’t like that, wait!’, which often
occurs as a second element in compounds. It has a negative value which is dis-
cussed in (7.1.2.) and it is also encountered in certain negative imperative con-
structions illustrated in (5.2.7.).
    In addition to a negative sense, ihƭ- has some further interrelated connota-
tions. In the first place, it has a contrastive semantic value, i.e. it negates a pre-
sumed presupposition. Secondly, the negation it expresses may be only tempo-
rary. The following example is from a dialogue in which TE explains why the
next day is not suitable for work:

              ‘tomorrow is Saturday, therefore there won’t be?’          TE:    a-'he=ihƭ-tsy-hͿ
                 exist-NEG=contrary-POT-NOM
                 ‘therefore there won’t be’ (t)In the second, the sixth and the eighth utterances of this dialogue, ihƭ- expresses
a temporary counter of supposition. They suggest that, for the time being, it is
not a good day to resume the work. But later, i.e. after tomorrow, it is.
    Note that the counter of supposition is not necessarily of temporary value:(2367)    wa'txi-re     hudada-'nãi        e-'re    txana-'nãi   ƭ'wã

5.5.29.    Contrastive -hehӻThere is a verbal morpheme -hehͿ, which replaces the mood marker. It ex-
presses contrast:(2370)     R:     tsewe-dy-'tõi-hata-tsi

                  ‘but I have glasses!’The element -he- of the morpheme looks like a negative morpheme and -hͿ
looks like a nominaliser. However, -hehͿ does not have any nominalising prop263.The traditional initiation of boys includes these ingredients. Only a few people in the

the negative in that it involves the rejection of a presupposition. The fact that
person cross-reference morphemes only precede the morpheme and the fact
that the element -he- does not bear stress also suggest this:(2371)    a'wͿi-wa-hehͿ                (*awͿi'hewahͿ)
          see-IS-CONT
          ‘they are looking’Countersupposition is discussed in (7.1.1.2.). Note that the contrast does not
have to be very strong:(2372)    Q:     tsǊhǊ-ra'ti kui-xa-'re              A:      ka'wİ    'kui-da-hehͿ

                 ‘what are you drinking?’                    ‘I’m drinking coffee!’The sentence ka'wİ 'kuidahehͿ ‘I’m drinking coffee!’ would not be a proper re-
ply to a warning that it is not real coffee, but oil, or poison.264 In the following
excerpt from a conversation the contrastive morpheme is used twice:(2373)    TE:    'deda          hanã'wã-na       'bou-tsy-rati

sition the hearer TE is holding that the speaker ME knows the story of the ori264.In that case the answer would have been kawİ kuidaki ‘I drink coffee’ or kawİki ‘it’s

knows about its existence through her only, and later ME did tell it. The second
occurrence rejects the presupposition that ME would be prepared to tell the
rainbow story.
   The contrastive morpheme is also encountered in the following type of
idiomatic expression:(2374)    nãi-'nãi     a'wͿi-wa-ta       'nãi-wa-hehͿ
          like-NOM see-IS-CSO            like-IS-CONT

          ‘just wait!’, ‘they will see!’The consultant said that women do not use this idiomatic expression.","[495, 496, 497, 498, 499]"
"Headwords are only listed in their radical forms, with the following
consequences. Nouns and adverbs are presented as complete words. Verbs are
presented as uninflected underived roots, which end in a hyphen. Transparently
derived forms do not have separate entries but may be dealt with under the entry
of their root. There are also verb roots which require further derivation with
specific affixes from a very limited set. Since these root and affix combinations
are not completely lexicalised I have presented the bound or etymological roots
in separate entries, but without such affixes. Conversely, certain verb roots that
contain recognisable but truly fossilised or lexicalised morphological elements
are presented in separate entries. Affixes are presented as isolated elements in
separate entries. Apart from the two prefixes, all affixes start with a hyphen and,
in case they cannot occur word-finally, they also end with a hyphen.
    The first line of each entry starts with a Kwaza headword, or rather,
headform, followed by an abbreviation between brackets, which indicates the
grammatical category of the headform, and it ends in an English equivalent of the
headform. In the rest of the entry, more specific grammatical information is
given, and illustrated by Kwaza examples of use in italic print, followed by free
English translations in inverted commas. The examples of use are not always in a
strictly phonological spelling, and contain additional phonetic information, such
as multiple stress marking, length, deviating vowel and consonant qualities and
other idiosyncrasies.
    On certain occasions, forms are presented in phonetic spelling in square
brackets. Note that this does not involve the IPA alphabet as in the other parts of
the present description, but that it is based on the phonemic orthography.
Futhermore, italics are also used in this case. This means that e.g. /c/ is
symbolised as [t] in part I and II, and as [c] here in part III. The [B] and [D] in
part III represent the plosive [b] and [d], and [O] represents close-mid [o]. In a
816   Dictionarynumber of instances the family or the exact speaker who uttered a certain
example is specified by an abbreviation.
    Whenever forms from neighbouring languages to which I happened to have
access showed similarities to the Kwaza forms, these were usually added at the
end of the entry in italic print. In respect to Kwaza terminology for flora and
fauna species, I have tried to find the corresponding Western scientific
equivalents mainly via the Brazilian Portuguese translations obtained from
consultants, thus in an indirect manner. Unfortunately, identical popular names
are very often used for different species in different regions, and dictionaries and
handbooks are therefore often contradictory. It even seems possible that some
species may not have received a Western scientific name yet. Therefore there are
doubts about a number of Western equivalents of local names in the present
dictionary. In a number of cases I did not succeed to identify a Kwaza name with
a certain species at all. In case of doubt I added the Aikanã terms, if available,
even if they were not likely to be etymologically related to the Kwaza terms. The
usual order is: scientific terms (species, genus, family, order); Portuguese terms;
English terms, all whenever available.
    Portuguese loanwords are also included if they are not the result of code-
switching, but have clearly become naturalised, i.e. part of the Kwaza lexicon,
e.g. through phonological adaptation. Their Portuguese origin is always
indicated. In contrast to the Portuguese equivalents of scientific terms mentioned
above, Portuguese forms that can explain Kwaza forms are always in italics.
    Section (3.) below contains an English-Kwaza index to the preceding
vocabulary. Because of the broad meaning of certain headforms, a number of
Kwaza forms are repeated with alternative English translations. This is why the
index has a higher number of entries (nearly 2800) than the vocabulary. Within
certain translational domains, such as “stick” or “foot”, the different Kwaza
equivalents are alphabetised according to the order in the Kwaza alphabet, where
e.g. <y> occurs before <k> and <c> after <ts>.
    All abbreviations used in this dictionary are listed at the beginning of this
work. All bibliographical references encountered in the dictionary are included in
the list of references.

                             Indices of affixes
In these indices, affixes are listed in different manners. The first index contains all
known affixes, both inflexional and derivational, ordered according to their form
in the Kwaza alphabet (see part I, section 2.16.). The other indices are all ordered
alphabetically according to their meaning. Index (2.) contains all attested
classifying morphemes, the last few of which also have directional uses. Index (3.)
contains all attested directional morphemes the last few of which also have
classifying uses. Index (4.) contains the three affixes that have only demonstrative
use. Index (5.) contains the affixes that are attached to nouns and do not change
the word class. Index (6.) contains the affixes that are attached to verbs and do not
change the word class. Index (7.) contains affixes that either that change the
specific word class of their host, or that are not applied to a root of one word class
exclusively, or that do not determine the word class of their host. The
abbreviations express this in the following manner: (svv) concerns a suffix that is
attached to a verbal root and produces an extended verbal root or stem; (svn)
concerns a suffix that is attached to a verbal root and produces nominal root or
stem, etc. The abbreviations involved are: a = adverb; dem = demonstrative; n =
noun; p = prefix; s = suffix; v = verb; x = unspecified.","[853, 854, 855, 856, 857, 858, 859, 860, 861, 862, 863, 864, 865, 866, 867, 868, 869, 870, 871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881, 882, 883, 884, 885, 886, 887, 888, 889, 890, 891, 892, 893, 894, 895, 896, 897, 898, 899, 900, 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 910, 911, 912, 913, 914, 915, 916, 917, 918, 919, 920, 921, 922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 928, 929, 930, 931, 932, 933, 934, 935, 936, 937, 938, 939, 940, 941, 942, 943, 944, 945, 946, 947, 948, 949, 950, 951, 952, 953, 954, 955, 956, 957, 958, 959, 960, 961, 962, 963, 964, 965, 966, 967, 968, 969, 970, 971, 972, 973, 974, 975, 976, 977, 978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985, 986, 987, 988, 989, 990, 991, 992, 993, 994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1016, 1017, 1018, 1019, 1020, 1021, 1022, 1023, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1036, 1037, 1038, 1039, 1040, 1041, 1042, 1043, 1044, 1045, 1046, 1047]"

8.3.2.2. Indefinite different subject: -dwa-The morpheme -dwa- is a variant of the indefinite subject cross-reference
marker -wa- (see 5.1.4.1.). It occurs only in the medial clause and it co-refers
with the indefinite subject of the next clause. It does not agree with the subject
of the present clause, but it indicates that the subject of the next clause is in-
definite, and that it is different from the subject of the present clause. Here are
some examples from texts by different narrators:(3587)    e'tay     aky'hͿ au're-dwa-ta wã'rͅ-dy-ta-wa-si

8.3.2.3. Switch reference mood: -siThe verb-root extension -dy- as discussed in (8.3.2.1.) is used to mark third
person switch reference. The next question is: how to indicate switch reference
with other persons? As explained above, the subject of a medial clause ending
in -ta is usually identical to the subject of the matrix clause. Because subject
identity finds expression in overt and covert coreferent person marking, one
would expect that non-coreferent person marking would suffice to indicate dif-
ferent subjects. However, things are not as straightforward as that. The proper
way to mark switch reference between non-third person subjects involves two
morphological operations. In the first place, there is overt non-coreferent per-
son subject marking. In the second place the medial clause ending -ta is re
682    8. Subordination and coordinationplaced by another medial clause ending -si. The element -si indicates that the
subject of the subsequent verb is different from that of the current verb. The
contrast between the following examples illustrates its use:(3598)    'kwİ-da-ta       atxitxi-'nǊ       'ja-da-ki
          enter-1S-CSO maize-CL:powder eat-1S-DEC
          ‘I entered and ate maize porridge’(3599)    'kwİ-da-si      ho'Bİto atxitxi-'nǊ        wa'dy-ta-ki
          enter-1S-SWR Roberto maize-CL:powder give-1O-DEC
          ‘I entered and Roberto gave me maize porridge’The hypothesis that -si indicates a switching referent explains why *kwİ-da-si
atxitxi-nǊ ja-da-ki, cf. example (3598), was considered uninterpretable by the
consultant.
   There is no functional difference between the switch reference markers -dy-
and -si. The consultant claimed that they meant the same thing, which is cor-
roborated by the contrast between (3563) and (3600), and by (3601):(3600)    (si) 'kwİ-da-si       mau'risiju wa'dy-ki      'Bousa          txi?a-'wã
          I      enter-1S-SWR Maurício       give-DEC bag                Txi?a-AO
          ‘I entered and Maurício gave the bag to Txi?a’(3601)    onİ-'si      oja-'ta-da-hͿ-ki
          arrive-SWR leave-TRA-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘he returned, I went there’In the above examples, the subordinated verb and the matrix verb express two
successive events. Verbs in the switch reference mood can also function as
complement clauses of perception verbs:390(3602)    la'to        dutu're tsutsu-'si        ã'wͿi-da-ki
          yesterday pig          piss-SWR        see-1S-DEC
          ‘yesterday I saw a pig pissing’(3603)    zjwã-'wã cari=a'sa-wa-si        hary'ky e'tay-tjate            Ǌtje'nãi-ki

          ‘they killed João but now his wife found out’Furthermore, it seems that -si also has a strong tendency to mark the subordi-
nated verb as a reason clause or maybe even a condition clause:
390.Note that -si can be replaced by nominalisers like -hͿ and -nãi practically without
    consequences for the meaning of the following sentences (see 8.4.).

           ‘we have to boil monkey meat for a long time for it to get soft’ (t)   There is no formal overlap between the domains of the switch reference
markers -dy- and -si. Whereas -dy- indicates a different third person subject, -si
indicates difference between a third person and a non-third person subject:391.A more correct translation would be probably ‘because he doesn’t force me’.
392.Note that phoneme fluctuation between /s/ and /ts/ has resulted in /-si/ being pro-
    nounced as [tsi] in this and the next example. In van der Voort (2000c:220, exx. 243
    and 244) the phonetic sequence -tsi was mistaken for the monitory mood morpheme
    and these examples were translated as: ‘lest we don’t club them, they run away’ and
    ‘it gets soft lest we don’t cook it long enough’ / ‘unless we fail to cook it long
    enough, it gets soft’. They were regarded as examples of a special construction in-
    volving the reverse sense of English ‘lest’, or, the mirror image of ‘unless’, which
    was attributed to the intrinsic negative sense of monitory -tsi. This illustrates how
    easily the linguist can stray in his or her wish to make sense of unusual data under all
    circumstances (and get away with it), and how vital the role of a good consultant is at
    all times.

two instances of coreferent subject marking in switch reference medial clause
constructions were recorded:394(3620)   erewe-'xy-da-si         kukui-ko'je-da-ki
         write-CL:leaf-1S-SWR hurt-CL:hand-1S-DEC

         marry-again-one-SWR     many-again-one-DEC
         ‘because we married again, we (multiplied and) grew again’Instead of the medial clause switch reference marker -si one would have ex-
pected same reference -ta, because the subjects of the cosubordinated and ma-
trix clauses are identical. Maybe the switch reference marker does not relate to
a discontinuity of the grammatical function of subject across the sentence, but
rather to discontinuity of some pragmatic function. Reesink (1983, 1987) and
Dik (1997a:322) note about a reverse situation in a Papuan language, where
subject switches do not necessarily lead to the expected different subject
marking, that switch reference can be used to indicate topic (dis)continuity.
    In (8.3.1.9.) and (8.3.2.1.) it was demonstrated that medial clause markers
may also occur as resumptive particles in the discourse together with person
marking. The same holds for the switch reference mood marker in combination
with person cross reference.(3623)   cwa-si
         IS-SWR
         ‘it is’, ‘now then’, ‘well’In fact, these grammatical morphemes, which are usually encountered as clitics
to verb stems, resume the continuity or indicate the discontinuity of semantic,
pragmatic or grammatical properties of the preceding utterance. This also oc-
curs in dialogues:
394.It should be mentioned here that both sentences were not procured from running
    texts, but they were offered by the consultant in isolation.

ehͿsi ‘well’ resembles “Tail-head linking” as described by De Vries (1989:204)

7.2.7. Expletive -rai- ‘damned!’The morpheme -rai ‘damned!’ has basically an exclamative function. Although
it can be used in a neutral way, it has usually a heavily expletive connotation.
However, this often occurs in an ironic context of faking indignation. The mor
548   7. Other morphosyntactic structurespheme is mostly applied to verb stems, between the person cross-reference and
mood markers:(2916)   ãwãka-da-'rai-re

         laugh-1S-damn-INT
         ‘I’m not joking!’-rai occurs very often in emphatically used interrogative clauses (see 5.2.2.1.).
Also the negative morpheme -he- may be involved, but without a negative
sense:(2922)   kui-he-rai-'re
         drink-NEG-damn-INT
         ‘didn’t he drink!, Jesus!’(2923)   'kui=jã-he-rai-re

may have a negative sense:(2924)   kui-rydy-'hͿ-rai-re

         ‘he isn’t going to drink, no way!’(2925)   atsile-rydy-'hͿ-rai-re

         hurt-CAU-1S-damn-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
         ‘it doesn’t hurt, no!’ (speaker does not want to admit he has pain)The expletive morpheme sometimes replaces the mood marker, as in the sec-
ond alternative answer to (2920), and it does not have to be very impolite. The
following examples represent possible answers to a compliment by someone
about the tasteful soup the speaker has made:(2927)   'wai-he-'ki                       (2928)      'wai-he-'rai
         good-NEG-DEC                                  good-NEG-damn
         ‘it does not taste good’                      ‘it does not taste good’In fact, (2928) was considered as more polite than the countersuppositional ex-
ample (2927).
    The following examples represent a fixed type of emphatic expression, in
which -rai replaces a mood marker, and in which the root wai- occurs in the
cosubordinative mood:(2929)   awy-'rjͿ-rai            wai-'ta         (*waiki)
         cold-CD:area-damn       good-CSO

         thirst-1S-damn good-CSO
         ‘I’m so thirsty!’It is not known whether one of the constituents is subordinated to the other.
    In the example (2865), -rai is attached to a noun. In the next example, the
derived noun is zero-verbalised:(2931)   'ñǊ-rai-re
         faeces-damn-INT
         ‘it isn’t dung, pal!’ (hearer was afraid to taste liquorice)
550   7. Other morphosyntactic structures   Section (7.2.1.) contains several examples in which -rai is combined with
the paucal morpheme -ry- in the following manner:(2932)   kuraku'ra-ry-'rai
         chicken-PAU-damn
         ‘those/my/your/his chicken’In this combination, -rai does not seem to have a strong expletive connotation.
However, it does seem that there can be a context dependent possessive con-
notation. That possessive relation can be made explicit, as in the next example:(2933)   'xyi-dy-hͿ    tala-ry-'rai
         you-POS-NOM uncle-PAU-damn
         ‘your uncles’    The morpheme -rai may be etymologically related to the verb root rai'hͿ-
‘to ruin’, and/or to the root of nouns such as 'rai?ͿhͿ ‘animal, thing’, 'rai?ͿnǊ
‘poison’.","[585, 586, 587, 588]"

that the expression is basically a localiser and refers to a place. Under “orienta-
tion”, “0” signifies that the expression is not specified as either hearer or
speaker-oriented, and “equi” means that the place or object is equally close to
speaker and hearer. Under “connotation” alternative or parallel interpretations
are listed, where “ANIN” means anaphoric in the instrumental case, and “TOPIC”
indicates metaphorical proximity in the discourse.(984) form           type         orientation connotation basic meaning      Ϳ-hͿ           ADAN         S             LOCA            this

tendency to be associated with speaker-orientedness and hearer-orientedness
respectively; 2) that the tendency mentioned in 1) is not absolute; 3) that in
jã?ͿhͿko ‘with that one’, -ko is productively applied to the demonstrative
jã?ͿhͿ ‘that one’, and that only an instrumental interpretation was observed; 4)
that the distal prefix jã- does not occur with the hearer-oriented root ay-; 5) that

exception to statement 4) was encountered in (951).
   The Kwaza demonstrative system appears to be subject to two basic pa-
rameters: obligatory orientation of the perspective of the discourse participants,
which is expressed by a choice between roots; and (optional) specification of
equality of distance with respect to the discourse participants or to the prag-
matic proximity of information in the discourse, which is expressed by a choice
between prefixes:Table 17. The Kwaza demonstrative system
      distance          {prefixes}                 {roots}         orientation
       distal               jã-                       ӻ-            speaker
     proximate             na-                       ay-             hearerAn additional parameter is “location” or “relative physical distance” involving
a more heterogenous set of forms: -hͿ-ko, -xuko and -rjͿ. There is an “implica-
tional” cline along which these forms range from “close” (I) via “within the
same settlement” (II) to “distant” (III):Table 18. Locative demonstratives
             I<                           II <                      III

           ‘here’              ‘here in this settlement’       ‘over there’
         ayhӻ’ko                       ayxu’ko                 (na-)ay’rjӻ
          ‘there’             ‘there in this settlement’       ‘over there’The deictic centre of cislocative ͿhͿ'ko ‘here’ is the speaker. -xuko is probably
also cislocative since it always means ‘within the settlement where the speaker
(and hearer) find themselves’. The distal range is relative and depends on the
discourse context: jã?Ϳ'rjͿ may mean ‘over there’ either inside the same settle-
ment, outside of it, or in another settlement.","[270, 271, 272]"

This is a description of a language. More specifically, this is the first comprehen-
sive documentation and study of the Kwaza language of Brazil. It is based on re-
search and interviews with native speakers between 1995 and 2002 in the
Guaporé region. This book is a corrected and thoroughly revised version of my
doctoral dissertation. Although no description of any language will ever be com-
plete and definitive, I believe nevertheless that the present work provides a repre-
sentative and reliable outline of the language. Even though this book concerns the
indigenous heritage of Brazil, it was for several reasons necessary to publish it in
English. I hope that there will be a Portuguese version one day, that is accessible
to both the indigenous peoples of Rondônia and a wider Brazilian public.
    Without the cooperation of native speakers, I could not have written this
grammar. In this sort of work native language consultants of field researchers
have often been called “informants”. Lately the term “collaborators” has been
proposed because that correctly reflects a more active role in the research on the
part of the consultant, and also because “informants” has developed a pejorative
connotation in certain contexts. However, since “collaborators” has at least as pe-
jorative a connotation in certain other contexts, I have avoided the use of either
one of them. Therefore I refer to the native speakers I worked with as my “con-
sultants” or, where it does not sound awkward, as my “teachers”. Whatever con-
notation these terms may develop in the future, in this book they intend to convey
reference to highly intelligent, kind and active participants in scientific research.

5.2.4.4. Beneficiary exhortativeIn a fixed construction with a pronoun bearing the beneficiary case marker -du,
the exhortative has the sense of ‘want’:(1444)    kanİ'xu si-du-'ni
          bracelet I-BER-EXH
          ‘I want a bracelet for me’
5.2.5. VolitiveThe volitive mood morpheme -mͿ is only found with the first person singular
subject, marked by -da-, and the first person exclusive subject, marked by -a-
xa-. It expresses a high level of determination on behalf of the subject and it
may have future connotations.(1445)    mƭu      'kui-da-mͿ          (1446)        mƭu      'kui-a-xa-mͿ
          chicha drink-1S-VOL                        chicha drink-1P-AS-VOL
          ‘I’m going to drink chicha!’184            ‘we’re going to drink chicha!’(1447)    hyhy'rwa-a-xa-mͿ      (1448)        ku'ri-ta-da-mͿ
          move-1P-AS-VOL                      quiet-TRA-1S-VOL
          ‘we’re going for a walk!’           ‘I’m not going to talk to him at all’It appears that the future connotation of the volitive -'mͿ only applies to con-
trolled verbs and that the canonical future tense morpheme -'nã- (see 5.5.5.) is
at least neutral with respect to the semantic feature of “control”:(1449)    hyja-'nã-da-ki               (*hy'ja-da-'mͿ)
          fall-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m going to fall’
184.The pronunciation ['kui!mÓ] or ['kui!amÓ] was heard on several occasions with one
    consultant (ME) and one case has been attested where the first person singular seems
    to be zero-marked: /'kui?eda'mͿ/ ‘I’m going to drink again’ pronounced as
    ['kui!e'mÓ]. These pronunciations were rejected by MA.
314    5. The verb phrase(1450)    kikalo-'nã-da-ki          (*kika'lo-da-'mͿ)
          fever-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m going to have fever’People do not usually fall on purpose, and, aside from the fact that usually no-
one wants a fever, people are generally not capable of getting a fever at their
wish. Nevertheless, the consultant said one could think of saying kika'lo-da-mͿ
‘I’m going to have fever!’ in case one is going to take a fever-evoking medi-
cine, or food such as pariri fruit together with honey which is said to cause fe-
ver. The following figure may depict the difference in grammaticality:Table 26. Verb control and the relative grammaticality of the volitive
                             -nã-                           -mͿ
+ control                    ¥                              ¥
- control                    ¥                              *For a number of controlled verbs the difference between the canonical future
and the volitive is as marked as the difference between ‘die’ and ‘commit sui-
cide’:(1451)    i'si-da-mͿ                          isi-'nã-da-ki
          die-1S-VOL                          die-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m going to kill myself’          ‘I’m going to die’(1452)    cari-'nͿ-da-mͿ
          shoot-REF-1S-VOL
          ‘I’m going to shoot (and kill) myself’With most controlled verbs and verbs which are ambiguous with respect to
“control” there is no obvious difference between the future -nã- construction
and the volitive -mͿ construction:(1453)    wãwͿ-'nã-da-ki                   wã'wͿi-da-mͿ
          sleep-FUT-1S-DEC                 sleep-1S-VOL

swer to an invitation or call or not, when one is very hungry or not, in an im-
mediate future or not. The difference probably lies in the fact that the volitive
has a connotation of desire, whereas the future is neutral in this respect.
   In combination with procrastinative -tara- (see 5.5.19.1.), the volitive -mͿ is
not inflected for person. It has a kind of postponing exhortative sense, and its
perspective is either first person singular subject, or, not surprising from a se-
mantic point of view, first person inclusive subject. In the examples below, it is
something else which will be postponed on behalf of the state of affairs as ex-
pressed by the verb root.(1456)    'ja-tara-mͿ                       (1457)    here?ece-hͿ-tara-'mͿ

          ‘let me/I’m going to eat first’             ‘let me rest first’
5.2.5.1. damͿ as a lexeme and as a bound modal morphemeThrough ellipsis of a verbal root the first person singular form of the volitive
may occur as a volitional paricle da'mͿ ‘I will’, ‘yes!’ insofar as the context
allows. It has a connotation of eagerness and its use may make a covetous im-
pression in certain contexts. For example as a minimal response to an invitation
to drink coffee da'mͿ is regarded as not very nice. Then again, it is a proper re-
sponse to a command.
    Such ellipsis has probably led to the emergence of an auxiliary-like inde-
pendent verbal root with the meaning ‘to be intending/wanting/going to (do)’,
which is marked for any person like any other verb root:(1458)    da'mͿ-xa-xa-ki
          want-2-AS-DEC
          ‘you (pl) are going to do’The zero-marked third person does not accept the application of the -ki de-
clarative (see 5.2.1.):(1459)    da'mͿ-tse                      (*damͿki)
          want-DEC
          ‘he is going to do’, ‘he says yes’185The second meaning of the latter example ‘he says yes’ is reminiscent of the
reported speech construction (see 5.5.11.) where person and mood inflexions
are cliticised to already existing person and mood inflexion. In the case of the
volitive this cliticisation again has led to the emergence of -damͿ- ‘is going to’,185.When speaking to children it means ‘you want?’.
316   5. The verb phrase‘wants to’ as a bound modality morpheme which expresses periphrastic future.
It is on a par with canonical future -nã- in many respects. Note, for example,
that -damͿ- as a modality morpheme neither requires the verb to be a “control”
verb, nor does it provide it with a “control” reading:(1460)   awe-'nã-tja       kyry'ja-ki bİ'rİ-damͿ-tse

         die-want-GER-NOM-PREC go-1S-DEC
         ‘while he was dying I went away’There may be semantic differences for the periphrastic future use of -damͿ- and
the canonical future -nã-, possibly in terms of temporal remoteness:(1464)   hako'ri ekawa-da'mͿ-tse (1465)          hako'ri ekawa-'nã-tse

         (while it is half moon)                 (while it is nearly full moon)Notice that the feature “control” may not be relevant for the difference between
these examples as it is inevitable that the moon becomes full.
   Also, the post-cliticisation of person and mood morphemes appears to have
lost its productive sense of reported speech in the process of lexicalisation of
-damͿ-:(1466)   İ-da'mͿ-xa-re              (1467)    bwa-da'mͿ-tse

          ‘you’re writing in order to learn’186In spite of the abovementioned changes and deviations from the original use
and sense of the first person volitive -da-mͿ, there are examples which suggest
that -damͿ- still has a strong sense of determination, and which contrast in this
respect with future -nã-:(1471)    'hudada-'nã-da-ki
          speak-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I want to (learn to) speak’(1472)    huda'da-da'mͿ-da-ki

          first     shoot=leave-want-1S-DEC
          ‘now I’ll kill him for sure!’    Apparently the productive inflexional first person volitive combination -da-
mͿ has become fossilised and developed into a new derivational volitional or
intentional modal morpheme -damͿ- ‘want’ and even into a modal verb root
with similar semantic content. In (5.5.15.) I discuss the possibility that this de-
velopment has involved quotation of speech and degrammaticalisation and that
it can be attested also with other mood morphemes, such as causational -nƭ-
(5.2.4.1.) and preventive -tsi- (5.2.9.1.).","[351, 352, 353, 354, 355]"
"
116.But note that this example is unreliable. The -Ϳ- was actually pronounced without
    nasalisation, and may have represented -a- here, which would in the same position
    function as a sort infinitive. Furthermore, the word was recorded outside of its proper
    pragmatic context, for which reason it is impossible to establish any attributive
    meaning.
192   4. The noun phrase   The morpheme -Ϳ- is also ambivalent in that, in addition to being used with
verbs, it can be applied to nouns or nominalised verbs:(741) o'wy-Ϳ-ki                            (742) 'tswa-Ϳ-hͿ

      ‘(hat with a) tail of buriti straw hanging down on the back’It can also be applied to adverbs (e.g. respectively: tja?a'tje ‘close by’, ha'bui
‘outside the house’, ele'le ‘very’, ‘much’, ‘EMPH’, tsiri'tsa ‘in the middle’,
atoto ‘upward’, aka'rwİ ‘over there’):(745) ã'wͿi-da-ki a'xy      tja?a'tje-Ϳ-xy

      what-FOC-ATT-2-INT
      ‘what is the matter with you?’ (t)The morpheme -Ϳ- may even occur following inflexions, like the locative case
marker of a prepositional object in:

      pan-LOC-ATT-NOM begin-CSO water shed-DEC
      ‘water began to leak from the pan’117The application of -Ϳ- to demonstrative stems will be shown in (4.6.) below.
The ambivalence demonstrated above of -Ϳ- towards the root to which it is suf-
fixed is not very surprising. Kwaza nouns and adverbs can easily be turned into
verbs by simply adding a verbal suffix, like e.g. the declarative -tse in:(753) hoiele'le-tse
      batvery-DEC
      ‘there are many bats’The primary root of the following example is a verb. The application of the
classifier -tu ‘back’ yields a noun meaning ‘slope’, which can also be used as
an adverbial compound in certain constructions.(754) tewe-'tu-Ϳ-he-tse
      slant-CL:back-ATT-NEG-DEC
      ‘it is not slanting’ (there is no word for *’horizontal’)So it is really not clear to which category tewe'tu ‘slope’ belongs. The classifier
suggests that it is morphologically a noun, but it can be used as a verb or ad-
verb without further morphological adaptation. The same holds for the follow-
ing root. ͅrjͅ'tõi means ‘wink’ as a verb stem, ‘from aside’ as an adverb, and if
it exists as a noun, which is suggested by the classifier -tõi ‘eye’ and by the
corresponding neutral nouns ͅrjͅ ‘rib’ and ͅrjͅhͿ ‘side’, it probably means
something like ‘eye from the side’ or ‘screwed-up eye’ (but this was not
tested):(755) ͅrjͅ-'tõi-Ϳ-ki
      side-CL:eye-ATT-DEC
      ‘he narrows his eyes (because of an illness etc.)’    As regards semantics, the morpheme -Ϳ- should basically be viewed as an
attributivising morpheme. The adjective-like or verbal root derived by -Ϳ- usu-
ally refers to an acquired or attributed property of its subject:(756) atsi'le-Ϳ-hͿ                           atsi'le-ki
      heavy-ATT-NOM                          heavy-DEC
      ‘heavy one’               vs.          ‘it is heavy’117.korejaro ‘pan’ cannot be subject here.
194   4. The noun phraseWhen the root is a noun, -Ϳ- indicates that an argument of the matrix sentence
is ‘provided with’ (741) or ‘in a permanent state of being’ (742) what the se-
mantic content of the nominal root refers to. In case an adverbial root is derived
by -Ϳ-, the resulting word refers to the location or the quantity of some argu-
ment in the matrix sentence.(757) 'ãi-Ϳ-hͿ
      far-ATT-NOM
      ‘the one further away/more to there’When -Ϳ- is attached to a noun bearing a locative case marker, the resulting
word refers to the origin of some argument in the matrix sentence:(758) ko'sa-na-Ϳ-hͿ            dai-'kwa-cwa-ki
      sun-LOC-ATT-NOM          grab-DR:inside-IS-DEC
      ‘he stole (batteries) from the lantern’(759) 'hã-na-Ϳ-'hͿ-ki
      water-LOC-ATT-NOM-DEC
      ‘it is from the water’Also (possessive) nouns with a locative semantic implication like xyi-dy-rjͿ
‘your place’ may acquire a connotation of origin through -Ϳ-:(760) 'xyi-dy-rjͿ-ki             koreja'ro
      you-POS-CD:area-DEC        pan
      ‘the pan is at your place’(761) xyi-dy-'rjͿ-Ϳ-tsy       koreja'ro

      you-POS-CD:area-ATT-NOM-INT
      ‘is it from your place?’
118.Note that xyi-dy-'hͿ korejaro would mean ‘your pan’, but *xyi-dy-'rjͿ korejaro
    would be ungrammatical.
                                                      4.3. Attributive modification    1954.3.2.2. Attributive roots with obligatory classifierUnder (721) in the preceding section we have seen a number of roots to which
the attributive morpheme -Ϳ- is obligatorily attached before any stem formative
morpheme can be applied. Most of these roots are semantically attributive, and
as such they also belong in fact to the present subsection. Nevertheless, they do
not require a subsequent classifier. Therefore I will not discuss them here
again.
    There is another limited set of roots, which is not used without the nomi-
naliser / neutral classifier -hͿ. The difference with the roots ending in -Ϳ- is that
those roots are not yet stems and require further morphological operations,
whereas the roots ending in -hͿ are well-formed stems and may occur as inde-
pendent words. If not further derived than (necessarily) by -hͿ, they are head
nouns or occur as modifiers in juxtaposition to other nouns. When they are
used predicatively, further derivation by verbal marking is required. The mor-
pheme -hͿ cannot be considered as lexicalised with the root, as it can be ex-
changed for a specific classifier (see 4.2.). I have called these roots “bound
roots”.
    The group of bound roots discussed here is also semantically attributive. Its
members are mostly used as stative verbs, but it is in principle not possible to
say that they are verb roots as they require a classifier before anything else.119
For various reasons (lack of time, no opportunity in the field) it was impossible
to document and investigate the behaviour of every lexical root and determine
exactly which other roots potentially belong to the group identified here. How-
ever, most of the roots listed below have been established to share the proper-
ties described here.(764) ay-                ‘that’
      aky-               ‘two’
      arwa-              ‘new’
      acwa-              ‘whole’
      awy-               ‘cold’
      dara-              ‘green, immature’
      dota-              ‘wild, young’

      huxe-              ‘hairy’
      Ϳ-                 ‘this’119.There is also another group of bound roots which requires -hͿ or a specific classifier.
    It consists mainly of semantically non-attributive transitive action / process verb
    roots, and in spite of the obligatory classifier, its members do not occur as nouns, and
    will therefore not be treated here (they are mentioned in 5.6.1. and 4.2.1.4.).

close to the speaker and ay- refers to things which are close to the hearer. These
roots cannot function as stems without -hͿ or a specific classifier. They can be
juxtaposed to an (omissible) head noun, as in (714) and in:(775) Ϳ-'hͿ      ko'sa 'si-dy-hͿ-ki

    Of those entries in list (764) which are explicitly marked with -hͿ it has not
been established whether the element can be replaced by a specific classifier.
All others occur either with -hͿ or with another classifier.
    As regards the root acwa-, it is not clear whether -hͿ is fully lexicalised with
this root.(778) i'sosisi acwa-'hͿ       wane-'ra
      rope      whole-NOM bring-IMP
      ‘bring the entire rope!’In acwa'rjͿ ‘the entire city’ and acwaricwa ‘city’ it seems to be replaced by
another classifier. There is a possibility, however, that the word has to be ana-
lysed further as having a verbal root a- ‘exist, live’.
   In order to form a noun, ko- ‘be empty, without’ usually requires not only
the application of a classifier but also a further derivation with -te ‘NOM’ (see
5.6.6.):(779) 'prego ko-hͿ-'tİ         a'xy e'hͿ-da-ki
      spike    lack-NOM-NOM house make-1S-DEC
      ‘I make a house without nails’When used as a verb, ko-hͿ- is not required to be succeeded by -te. It is some-
what similar to txi- ‘very big’. In fact, there is even less justification for txi- to
occur in the present list, because it always requires the further derivation with
-te ‘NOM’:(780) ƭ'tswİ̘  txi-hͿ-'tİ                    xui txi-yi-'tİ

198    4. The noun phrase   No attributive use of the numeral teihͿ ‘one’ was attested, nor any replace-
ment of -hͿ with other classifiers.
   It is not clear whether tsanͿsi'hͿ ‘last’ could be further analysed as ‘the fol-
lowing one’. Morphologically this would be difficult, since the verb tsa'si-
‘follow’ is an unanalysable root and reflexive -nͿ- is in the present work not
supposed to behave as an infix.120 Semantically, however, it is tempting to as-
sume a relationship.(781) tsi'ki            tsanͿsi-'hͿ
      younger.brother last-NOM
      ‘younger brother’Some semantically attributive (verbal) roots could also have been included in
the above list, such as wai- ‘good’, nͿ- ‘fat’, kukui- ‘pain’. However, they may
occur either with or without the element -hͿ-, be it with a slightly different
meaning (as noted in 4.2.1.9.):(782) 'wai-ki               wai-'hͿ-ki               wai-'xy-ki
      good-DEC              good-NOM-DEC             good-CL:house-DEC
      ‘it is good’          ‘it is beautiful’        ‘it is a beautiful house’(783) 'rai?ͿhͿ wai-'hͿ-hͿ
      thing    good-NOM-NOM
      ‘very beautiful things’Since the meaning differences between forms with and without -hͿ are quite
small, respectively waihͿ- ‘nice’, nͿhͿ- ‘big’, kukuihͿ- ‘ill’, and since these dif-
ferences are not always consequently distinguished or distinguishable, I have
so far regarded the application of -hͿ as not immediately obligatory. Therefore,
such roots were not discussed in the present subsection.
    Apart from the roots mentioned in (764), there is a number of other adjec-
tive-like roots which do require the element -hͿ-, or another classifier, but of
which no nominal use was attested:(784) babarİ̘'hͿ-        ‘warm’
      bony-              ‘again’ (only as an adverb)121
      hatsi'hͿ-          ‘naked, smooth’
      kyikyi'hͿ-         ‘angry’
      koxona'hͿ-         ‘itchy’
      mǊrjetuce'hͿ-      ‘vertiginous’
      xay'hͿ-            ‘happy’120.Here -nͿ- is used as a directional morpheme, for which see (5.3.1.).
121.The root bony- does not occur with other classifiers than -'hͿ, but it can occur with
    the temporal adverbial nominaliser -wy ‘time’ (see 6.2.4.1.).

       tjaru'hͿ-        ‘ready’
       tsu'hͿ-          ‘jealous’
       tsunͿ'hͿ-        ‘expensive’From a morpho-semantic point of view these, and other semantically attributive
roots which do not require the element -hͿ- at all, are interesting but they will
not be discussed any further here.
    In principle, possessive constructions could have been dealt with here as
well. The difference with the present group of roots is that possessive attribu-
tives have an independent nominal stem as root. The similarity with the roots
presented in this subsection is that once the possessive morpheme -dy- is ap-
plied, an ensuing classifier is obligatory. The resulting stem can be juxtaposed
to an optional head noun, as shown in (4.3.1.).","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237]"

5.1.4.1. Indefinite subjectwa ‘IS’. The indefinite subject morpheme -wa- is often encountered as the sole
person inflexion on a verb. It indicates that the third person subject is not speci-
fied, only the semantic content of the predicate being of interest.(1103)    'kui-wa-'ki
          drink-IS-DEC
          ‘people are / someone is drinking’This utterance was made in a context in which the speaker went over to the
nearby house and heard or saw that there was a party going on, and upon re-
turning she informed the hearer about it (for reasons such as the hearer having
asked the speaker to see for him, or the speaker wanting to get the hearer to ac-
company her and join the party). In such a context, kuiki ‘they are / he is
drinking’ would have been less appropriate. So kuiwaki can be translated more
or less as ‘there is drinking going on’. Similar examples can be given:(1104)    dodotxi'te o'hui-ki              (1105)    dodotxi'te o'hui-wa-ki
          ball         play-DEC                      ball        play-IS-DEC
          ‘he/they are playing ball’                 ‘they (many) are playing ball’(1106)    a'wͿi-da-ki     a'rǊi-wã     mawdy'ne-wa-ta

    non-interrogative constructions (4.7.4.).

contexts in order to be able to explain the exact meaning and possible idiomatic
uses of the indefinite subject marker in every attested occurrence, than can be
done in the present work. As an example it was sometimes said that the addi-
tion of -wa- could be regarded as “respectful”. Nevertheless, there is an impor-
tant morphosyntactic clue which corroborates the “indefinite”-hypothesis of
-wa-: the indefinite morpheme does not cross-reference an overt argument. In
general, a definite argument is then unmentionable:(1111)    lu'zeu   mƭu      peri'Dauwa-wã wa'dy-ki
          Luzeu chicha Peridalva-AO give-DEC
          ‘Luzeu gave chicha to Peridalva’(1112)    *luzeu mƭu       peri'Dauwa-wã wa'dy-wa-ki

          Piu scream-NOM-DEC
          ‘Piu screamed’The following example contained -wa- even though both speaker and hearer
knew the identity of the subject (in this case Daniel Latundê):(1114)    ywy'nwͿ 'dy=asa-wa-ki
          tree    cut=leave-IS-DEC
          ‘someone/they cut the log and cleared it out of the way’Nevertheless, it is impossible to inquire about the identity of the subject while
using an indefinite cross-reference marker:157.Even if no-one knows who Luzeu is, this sentence is ungrammatical.

         who scream-IS-INT
         ‘who screamed?’This was also illustrated in (4.7.4.). However, some overt arguments can be re-
garded as indefinite:(1116)   txi'rja wy'ru-wa-re          (1117)     txi'rja-wa-ta
         everyone grind-IS-INT                   everyone-IS-CSO
         ‘everyone helps grinding?’ (t)          ‘being everyone / everyone is’There is no indefinite pronoun ‘someone’ or ‘nobody’. Instead, a nominalised
verbalisation of a noun may be used:(1118)   mãrİ̘ri'tsa-wa-hͿ kwİ'nİ-wa-ki
         human-IS-NOM      enter-IS-DEC
         ‘someone/a person entered (here, while we were away)’(1119)   Ǌcenãi-'he-wa-hͿ       ere're-wa-ki
         know-NEG-IS-NOM        write-IS-DEC
         ‘they are writing up that which nobody knows’Apparently, some nouns like wã ‘wasp’ can act as an indefinite subject. The
reason for this possibility is probably that when a swarm of wasps attacks, they
are not definite individuals any more, as far as the victim is concerned. So one
could say that the application of -wa- has a de-individualising effect. This may
also create a passive-like effect, though not more than that:(1120)   wã e'xyi-ki              (1121)      wã e'xyi-wa-ki
         wasp sting-DEC                       wasp sting-IS-DEC
         ‘the wasp stung him’,                ‘wasps stung him’,
         ‘it’s a wasp who stung him’          ‘he received stings from wasps’(1122)   wã-'wã e'xyi-wa-ki
         wasp-AO sting-IS-DEC
         ‘they stung the wasp’An alternative translation of (1121) had an indefinite object: ‘wasp stung
someone’. This may suggest a passive nature of -wa- (‘people were stung’) af-
ter all. However, the verb exyi- ‘sting (by wasp)’ is exceptional itself: the form
e'xyi-da-ki, with first person subject inflexion, both means ‘I stung (him)’ as ‘I
got stung’. It is probably because of the unusualness of the first, literal mean-
ing, that the second interpretation is enabled. Nevertheless, it is considered
more correct to use a first person object form in this case: e'xyi-ta-ki ‘I got
stung’ (lit. ‘stung me’). Also the result of nominalisation of certain verb stems
262   5. The verb phrasemay be ambiguous in this respect: it may refer to an object or to the subject, re-
gardless whether -wa- is present:(1123)   dutu're hãtsǊ-'hͿ           (1124)      dutu're hã'tsǊ-wa-'hͿ

         ‘I saw that pig which they skinned’These constructions were also discussed in (8.4.1.4.).
   Although I have found no evidence for a passive in Kwaza, it should be
mentioned that elicited translations of Portuguese passive sentences into Kwaza
often contain the element -wa-:(1127)   ecoto'hͿ-wa-ki     ca'ri-wa-ki       (1128)    tã'jã 'ta-wa-hͿ

         ‘they killed him’                              ‘the one they call chief’When a truly definite subject is expressed in combination with indefinite sub-
ject reference -wa-, this subject is part of a group functioning as an indefinite
subject:(1129)   lato-'wy          pju ohui'nƭ-wa-ta
         yesterday-time Piu play-IS-CSO
         ‘yesterday, Piu and the others were playing’
         (lit. ‘yesterday Piu they were playing’)This may create the impression that the element -wa- is a plural marker:(1130)   i'grezja-'na e'tay  'tswa-cwa-ta 'nãi-wa-ki

phology of Kwaza, whereas most occurrences of -wa- suggest that it expresses
indefiniteness of the subject. The contrast between following examples shows
that a plural subject reading is out of the question:(1132)   aky-'hͿ    e'mã-cwa-ta    'dai-cwa-ki ('manga)
         two-NOM more-IS-CSO take-IS-DEC mango

         two-NOM more-IS-CSO RED-take-IS-DEC              mango
         ‘a number of people took three (mangoes)’The contrast between (1132) and the next example rather confirms that indefi-
niteness is involved:(1134)   aky-'hͿ      e'mã-tja   'dai-kizjwõ 'manga
         two-NOM more-CSO take-DEC João mango
         ‘João took three mangoes’    Only few examples were encountered which appear to go against the indefi-
nite analysis of -wa-:(1135)   zjwãu     'kwİ-wa-ki
         João      enter-IS-DEC
         ‘João entered here’It is not so likely that this example has a similar pragmatic context as (1129).
    The following example is from a story about a tapir which transforms itself
into a human being. When the transformed man was shot dead, he turned back
into a tapir:(1136)   ã'rǊi a're-wa-hͿ
         tapir turn-IS-NOM
         ‘the transformed tapir’ (t)Here there is no doubt about the definiteness and singularity of the tapir, but
maybe there is an explanation in the fact that the transformation happened
automatically, and that the tapir is not a subject here any more.
   In combination with the imperative mood, -wa- may have a kind of vocative
function:(1137)   tso'roi-wa-ra
         run-IS-IMP
         ‘run, everybody!’
264    5. The verb phraseThe fact that -wa- does not only have its normal indefinite function here is con-
firmed by the fact that it can be succeeded by another subject marking element
-xa-:158(1138)    towa-'nã-tse      tso'roi-wa-xa-ra=tja 'ta-ja-hͿ=wara
          fall-FUT-DEC run-IS-AS-IMP=CSO talk-IO-NOM=but
          ‘“it’s going to fall, people, run!”, he warned them, but ...’ (t)    On some occasions -wa- was explicitly indicated by the consultant to have
an evidential function. For the following example MA deliberately described a
context of the speaker arriving in a room where (either one or many) people are
in the presence of an empty coffee pot and that that is the reason to draw the
conclusion that those people must have drunk all the coffee:(1139)    ka'wİ    kui='bwa-(c)wa-ki
          coffee drink=end-IS-DEC
          ‘(apparently) they finished the coffee’In this case the evidence is indirect, and it is possible that the evidential analy-
sis of -wa- matches with the (unfortunately often poorly registered) contexts of
many (elicited) examples in the present section. However, the fact that the oc-
currence of this morpheme was claimed to rule out the presence of overt argu-
ments in most cases, such as in (1112) and (1113), goes against this analysis
(but note that (1135) is a telling exception in this respect). Furthermore there
seem to be elicited examples of -wa- occurring in eyewitness contexts, e.g. in
(1103) above and in (3510) in (8.3.1.5.). Also, there are many cases of -wa- oc-
curring in eyewitness accounts in the initiation story by ME (part II, text 3.1.).
On the other hand, MA complained about the latter story that ME talked about
her experiences in a way as if she had not participated herself. Furthermore, the
problem remains that the isolated utterances and their contexts were all elicited
in relatively uncontrolled settings, and it cannot be excluded that the consult-
ant’s interpretation of the imagined situation was completely the opposite. As
more textual research is needed here I consider indirect evidentiality for the
time being as a side effect of the basic indefinite function of -wa-.
    The indefinite subject marker -wa- has several allomorphs. The allomorph
-cwa- occurs often as an optional variant of -wa- in cosubordinating construc-
tions discussed in (8.3.1.5.), when following the negative morpheme -he-
(7.1.1.), and probably when following the future morpheme -nã-:(1140)    kui-nã-cwa-ki              (*kui'nãwaki)
          drink-FUT-IS-DEC
          ‘they’re going to drink, there’s going to be drinking’158.In this example, -xa- was glossed as an associated third person marker, but there is
    no way to establish here whether it is not rather a second person subject marker.
                                                      5.1. Person cross-reference    265The allomorph is obligatory in constructions which involve double sets of in-
flexion marking such as quoted speech (5.5.11.), purposive (5.5.12.) and con-
jectural (5.5.14.) constructions. In the remote past (5.5.4.) and habitual (5.5.26.)
constructions, the allomorph -cwa- is usually reduplicated and has the forms
-cu-, -ci- or -ti- ([tu] ~ [tÓ] ~ [ti] ~ [ti]). This is further illustrated by several ex-
amples in the relevant sections, but note also (1130) and (1131) above. The in-
definite different subject morpheme -dwa- is probably related to -wa-. It occurs
only in cosubordinated clauses and indicates that the subject is different from
the indefinite subject of the next clause. This is dealt with in (8.3.2.2.).
   Note that the third person declarative marker -tse is never encountered in
combination with -wa- or its allomorphs.
   Note also that neither -wa- nor its allomorphs seem to cross-refer to inani-
mate subjects.
   The form -wa- has a reflex [swa] in the first and second person object mor-
phemes -taxwa- and -xuxwa-. Some of the properties of indefinite cross-
reference demonstrated above will be illustrated more extensively under
-xuxwa- and -taxwa- below, and under -ja- in (5.1.4.2.).taxwa ‘IS.1O’. In the indefinite subject- first person object morpheme -taxwa-,
the first person object marker -ta- is clearly identifiable. The remaining element
-xwa- strongly resembles the indefinite subject marker -wa-. The relation be-
tween -xwa- and -wa- cannot be explained by morphophonemic rules. Most
likely -xwa- is lexicalised in both -taxwa- ‘(IS.1O)’ and -xuxwa- ‘(IS.2O)’.
    The following examples show this morpheme involved in cross-reference to
indefinite subject combined with a first person object (which consequently is
definite).(1141)    wa'dy-taxwa-ki                          (1142)     ka'hİ-taxwa-ki

          ‘they/he (someone) gave to me’                     ‘they bit me’About the intended subject(s) in example (1142) the consultant said “you can’t
say their names”. Also, it is not possible to inquire about the identity of the in-
definite subject:(1143)    di'lİ ka'hİ-ta-re            (*dilİ ka'hİtaxware)
          who bite-1O-INT
          ‘who bit me?’This is also illustrated for other persons and for -wa- in (4.7.4.).
   The next examples show the occurrence of -taxwa- in various constructions.
In every one of them, it has the same sense.

-xuxwa-, the apparent second person element -xu- does not strongly resemble
the second person subject morpheme -xa-. One consultant (TE) says [tsiswa].
The constituent elements of -xuxwa- cannot function as separate morphemes
for themselves: wadyxuxwaki ‘someone/they gave to you’ vs. *wadyxuki,
*wadyxwaki.
     According to MA -xuxwa- is an alternative to -hata-. Clearly, the indefinite
subject is felt as an (indefinite) third person subject. As with -wa- and -taxwa-,
it is not possible to specify or inquire about the subject:(1149)   ka'hİ-xuxwa-ki      (1150)    di'lİ ka'hİ-hata-re (*ka'hİxuxware)

         ‘someone Peridalva gave/is giving chicha to you’The following contrasted examples both contain an object marked for animate
object case. This further corroborates that no morphological passive is involved
in indefinite subject cross-reference:(1159)   xyi*(wã) wa'dy-hata-ki              (1160)    xyi*(wã) wa'dy-xuxwa-ki

curs normally as a fixed part of -xuxwa- and -taxwa-. Among the rare instances
of its “independent” use we find it in example (1071). It is not clear whether
indefinite subject -(x)wa- is etymologically related to the (homophonous) clas-
sifier -xwa- ‘man’.eteja-wa ‘1PO-IS’ and etelexwa-wa ‘2PO-IS’ are morpheme combinations in
which the indefinite subject morpheme -wa- is productively applied to the cor-
responding first person plural and second person plural definite object mor-
phemes -eteja- and -etelexwa-. No distinction is made between inclusive and
exclusive first person object.(1161)   'mİ̘-eteja-wa-ki                    (1162)    ka'hİ-etelexwa-wa-ki

268   5. The verb phrase5.1.4.2. Indefinite objectja ‘IO’. The indefinite object morpheme -ja- is the objective equivalent of sub-
jective -wa-. Just like -wa- it is frequently encountered as the sole person in-
flexion on a verb, and it indicates that the third person object is not specified,
as only the semantic content of the predicate is of interest.(1163)   mƭu       darje-'dy-ja-ki

         ‘the woman is not angry towards people’The morpheme -ja- is fully productive for all subjects, including indefinite
subject, and has to precede the subject markers. As with all other indefinite
cross-reference morphemes, it is in principle not possible to mention an overt
object corresponding with -ja-.(1167)   lu'ze-wã     wa'dy-xa-ki          (*lu'zewã wady'jaxaki)

reference marker can be immediately adjacent to the special declarative marker
-tse. One would expect the same to be the case for the indefinite object marker
-ja-. Note, however, example (1198) below and the following one:(1177)    wady-'ja-tse
          give-IO-DEC
          ‘he gave to him’   On the verb roots ta- ‘to talk’ and İhİta- ‘to tell’, -ja- may have an evasive
function. It is used evasively when it refers to one’s living close relatives, espe-
cially children, grandchildren or newly born babies:(1178)    'hoBinson 'ta-ja-da-ki
          Robinson talk-IO-1S-DEC
          ‘I call him Robinson’It may even have a lamentative interpretation, and it is often used to refer to
deceased persons, which may not necessarily be relatives:(1179)    'si-dy-hͿ     a'ha     'ta-ja-da-ki
          I-POS-NOM father       talk-IO-1S-DEC

          ‘I warned the poor fellow’
270   5. The verb phrase   It is not clear whether -ja- can also refer to inanimate indefinite objects.
Possibly it cannot:(1181)    ã'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki     ãwͿi-'ja-xa-xay-'hͿ
          see-1S-NOM-DEC see-IO-2-2-NOM
          ‘I saw that photo you took of them’(1182)    ã'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki      ã'wͿi-xa-xay-hͿ
          see-1S-NOM-DEC see-2-2-NOM
          ‘I saw that photo you took (of house, dog, waterfall etc.)’  Usually, no other morphemes intervene between object and subject markers.
Only two positive exceptions were attested:159(1183)    'krİBa-na oitsi-ja-'nã-xa-re
          Gleba-LOC copulate-IO-FUT-2-INT
          ‘are you going to get laid in Gleba?’In section (7.1.), the relative position of the negation morpheme is discussed.
The negative morpheme canonically precedes the cross-reference markers:(1184)    kahİ-'he-ja-ki
          bite-NEG-IO-DEC
          ‘it (e.g. grasshopper) does not bite’In case of negation of a presupposition, however, the negative morpheme fol-
lows cross-reference marking:(1185)    axehͿ-ja-'he-damͿ-cehere (jã-ki)
          find-IO-NEG-want-APPR          be-DEC
          ‘I think that she is going to encounter no-one (EMPH)’(1186)    we-'tja-he-ky        ka'hİ-ja-he-ki
          fear-TRA-NEG-IMP bite-IO-NEG-DEC
          ‘don’t be afraid, it does not bite (anyone)’   Normally, double object marking within a single verb is not accepted:(1187)    *wai-ja-ta-ki
          good-IO-1O-DEC
          ‘it does good to me’159.Also in example (1053) a future morpheme follows the object morpheme.
                                                 5.1. Person cross-reference   271It appears that -ja-, although being an object marker itself, can occur together
with another, definite object marker in one word:(1188)   axehͿ-ja-'he-eteja-ki
         find-IO-NEG-1PO-DEC
         ‘he did not meet us’Note that both object markers are separated by a negative morpheme and that
-ja- precedes it. This can be seen as a case of recursive derivation, and it may
indicate that -ja- is derived on a deeper level than the subsequent elements. A
likely interpretation would be ‘he met no-one of us’ or ‘he did not meet anyone
with respect to us’. This also suggests that -ja- is not a constituing part of
-İteja-. Maybe -ja- is lexicalised with the verb root as axehͿja- ‘meet’.
    The indefinite object morpheme has clearly a plural connotation in the fol-
lowing example:(1189)   e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-ra
         woman-COL-AO give-IO-IMP
         ‘give (it) to all women!’   It is not clear whether the second occurrence of -ja- in the third phrase be-
low represents a second instance of indefinite object marking:(1190)   wady-'ja-da-ki          ‘I gave to them’
         wady-'ja-du'hͿ-da-ki    ‘I gave all to them’
         wady-'ja-duhͿ-'ja-da-ki ‘I gave all to them all’    Even though the following example involves a definite subject, -ja- is ap-
plied. It is probably lexicalised with the root asa- ‘to leave’ as a euphemism:(1191)   asa-'ja-da-ki
         leave-IO-1S-DEC
         ‘I buried him’    Some verbs contain a root-final element -ja-, which may originate from the
indefinite object morpheme, but which is completely lexicalised. Semantically
it does not refer to an indefinite object. As an example xareja- ‘search things’
does take overt definite objects: ui xare'jadaki ‘I’m looking for the tobacco’. In
order to refer to an indefinite object the addition of -ja- is required:(1192)   xareja-'ja-da-ki        (1193)       waja-'ja-he-tsy-tse
         search-IO-1S-DEC                     bring-IO-NEG-POT-DEC
         ‘I’m searching (many) people’        ‘he is not going to bring anyone’
272   5. The verb phrase5.1.4.3. Extension to inclusive object referenceSome translations provided by the consultant suggest that, in the proper con-
text, a first person object can be “understood” and be expressed by the indefi-
nite object morpheme -ja-:(1194)   'a-ty-ja-ki               (1195)    o'tsi-ja-ki
         exist-DET-IO-DEC                    fall-IO-DEC
         ‘there was for us’                  ‘it fell on top of us’(1196)   axe'hͿ-ja-ki
         find-IO-DEC
         ‘he met (us)’ (accidentally on the road)In fact, the example (1196) was presented in a first person inclusive context,
whereas contrasted with a first person exclusive context the consultant offered
the following Kwaza equivalent:(1197)   axe'hͿ-e'teja-ki
         find-1PO-DEC
         ‘he met (us)’ (accidentally on the road)These examples represent the only attested pair in which a contrast between in-
clusive and exclusive first person interpretations of object cross-reference
markers can be suspected. Now remember from example (1177) above that,
against expectations, the indefinite object marker -ja- can be followed by the
special declarative marker -tse. So, when inquiring about a truly indefinite ob-
ject equivalent of (1196) the following sentence was offered:(1198)   axehͿ-'ja-tse
         find-IO-DEC
         ‘he met them’As a consequence, two apparent anomalies with respect to the expected be-
haviour of object cross-reference; an inclusive reading (of -ja-) and a combina-
tion (of -ja-) with the morpheme -tse, may be related in that they work together
to enable both the expression of an inclusive object and of a true indefinite ob-
ject. In view of the fact that these are the only clear examples encountered, it
may not be the case that the distinctions discussed here are fully grammati-
calised. Example (1094) above forms evidence for the fact that -eteja- may
cross-refer to an inclusive pronoun. Furthermore, the verb axehͿ- ‘find’ may be
ideosyncratic. Nevertheless, about the following examples it was said that they
have the same meaning, but that the second alternative was “better”:
                                                      5.1. Person cross-reference   273(1199)    'mİ̘-ja-wa-ki                 (1200)     mİ̘-'eteja-wa-ki

          ‘they hit us’                            ‘they hit us’In case the first alternative involves an inclusive first person object, it may have
been considered as less felicitous because it is less easy to imagine a proper
pragmatic context for uttering it.","[297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311]"
