2. 1. 2 MOOD
   I am using the term ' mood' to refer to a fuzzy parameter along which Yele makes three
structural distinctions, based on the type of speech act and the specificity of the action. These
distinctions are marked in the verbal prenucIeus and postnucIeus, and even affect the verb
root with some verbs. From the perspective of speech act, Yele makes only one major
distinction, namely that between informational speech and commands. Questions use the
same verb roots and exactly the same prenucIear and postnuclear components as do
                                                                                               19statements. Imperatives differ markedly in form from statements and questions. (Yes-no
questions differ from statements in intonation, and content questions contain a question
word. Otherwise they are the same as statements.) Thus Yele distinguishes morphologically
between informational speech and imperatival speech.
   Within informational speech, Yele distinguishes between reference to specific events in
the past, present or future, as opposed to habitual events that people perform. The reference
to specific events is termed the indicative mood in this paper, while the reference to habitual
events is the habitual mood. Table 2. 1.2. 1 shows these distinctions diagrammatically.","[26, 27]"

"   The definite morpheme w- is nearly always used with future questions ( 1 0 1 ), but is not
used with a negative future statement with a first or second person subject. (Compare ( 1 00)
and ( 1 02).)

   In other future indicative forms (i.e. positive questions and statements), its use is
optional. In fact, the meaning of w- is rather difficult to determine in future positive
statements. In some texts it correlates fairly closely with duration, punctiliar events using w-,
continuous events not using it. Compare ( 1 03a) with ( 1 03b).

   Text (b) (a procedural text about copra making) in §2.4 illustrates the difficulty of
determining the function of W-. As stated in §2. 1 .3 (just above example (23», a second
person singular subject form in future tense is used for procedures that people in general
follow. The predicate prenucleus in this case is (w-)a-nyi. An adaptation of the free
translation of that text follows, in which w-a -nyi is represented as w-you and a-nyi as @-you.

At first sight the use of w-a-nyi or a-nyi in this text seems quite random, one form being
used for several clauses, and then the other form for several clauses. But then a subtle
difference emerges. Sentence 2 refers to any time in general when one would be making
copra, and begins the sequence of operations involved, all without the W-. The switch to
                                                                                                  51using w- comes with sentence 3, which begins with U kuw6 dini ghi nge ' after that ' . The
situation is a little more definite now - the processing has begun and should not be
interrupted until it is completed. And so the clauses through to 5b all use w-a -nyi, but 5c uses
a-nyi, apparently because it refers to some generic prior time at which the firewood should
have been gathered. The definite situation marked with w- is resumed in 9a with further steps
in the copra-making process, until the end of the process is reached in 1 1 a, and the copra is
in the shed on the wharf waiting for shipping to market.
   Sentence 1 4 begins an evaluative paragraph which presents the consequences of
processing copra well or badly, and this more general situation is indicated by the absence of
w-. So far so good. But why is w- used in sentence 1 7 ? Sentence 17 is essentially the same
condition and consequence as are found in 1 5, which does not have W-. It seems that here the
w- is used as a prominence marker, to highlight the responsibility a man has to process his
copra properly. And the w- is continued in sentence 18 to enforce the conclusion.","[57, 58, 59]"

(2) Specifier
  The Head noun of the phrase can be specified by a deictic, a question word or a
comparative expression. When this happens, many nouns take on a ' specified' form, others
remain unchanged, as in example (2 1 9).

                    that word
   Some of the nouns which show this specification do so by having -ni suffixed to them, as
                                                    ,
in example (220), while others change to a specified form, as in examples (22 1 ) and (222).

(4) Quantifier
   The Head of a noun phrase can be quantified either by a number marker or by a numeric
expression. The Quantifier follows the noun. Two number markers are used, de for dual
items and yoo for plural animate items.

singular agreement in the verb.","[79, 80, 81, 82]"

   As listed in Table 2. 1 . 7 . 5 . 1 , ala and mu have cataphoric reference when used i n
discourse, and wu and yi have anaphoric reference. Discussion with the speaker o f this text,
Raymond, confirmed that ala used in clause (95a) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (c) and (d), and that its use in clause (g) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). He also said that mu in clause (h) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). Mu seems to be used here rather than ala, because it introduces another
following REASON, as mu is used as a deictic to refer to an 'other' entity. When asked
about yi in clause U), he said it referred to all the previous REASONs. Concerning wu in
(96a) and (96c), he said it referred to the earlier pair of REASONs in (95c) and (95d). There
is a parallel here between the real-world usage of wu to refer to an entity which is out of
sight. The earlier pair of preceding REASONs is 'out of sight' compared with the later pair
of preceding REASONs.
   Five of these deictics have parallels in the predicate prenucleus with similar meanings. For
example, the basic form of the certainty prefix is Ja''.., and its typical use is to indicate that the
speaker was an eyewitness to an event. While kJ- and its variants are used with non-future
indicative events, future indicatives (that is events that have not been ' seen' yet) can be
marked with w- 'definiteness' in the same position in the predicate prenucleus.
( 1 ) Incorporating the deictic kJ
   The incorporation of the other deictics is described in detail below, but first let us examine
kJ- and W-. The basic form kJ- merges into the predicate prenucleus. In the present tense of
continuous events, it takes the form k-, and is used only with third person subjects.

       kJ + nmJ --> kunu
       kJ + dpJ    --> kudu
       kJ + nmo --> kuno
       kJ remains unchanged elsewhere.

96FREE TRANSLATION - A procedural discourse - how to make copra
1 . Now I'm going to talk about making copra.
2. To begin with, you gather the coconuts and put them in heaps. 3 . After that you husk
them, you pluck the fibres off them, you break them open and take them to the copra house.
4. You put them face down and light the fire underneath, after first gathering the firewood.
5. It dries for five days in the copra house, with the fire going underneath all the time. 6. If it
dries well, the water won ' t stay in it, 7. the moisture comes out, leaving the oil inside
properly . 8. So that copra is dried properly . 9. After that you ram it. 1 0 . You gather the
copra to the ramming place. You sew up the bags and put the copra well , so that it doesn' t
get moist again. 1 l . You take i t t o the wharf and leave i t i n the shed there, waiting for the
boat. 1 2 . When the boat comes the crew load it aboard. 1 3 . It goes to Samarai, and from
there to the Copra Marketing Board.","[103, 104]"

882.3.4 MODALITIE S
   This section deals with those items traditionally called ' modalities ' , such as desire,
possibility and permission. Yele uses two items here, U yi 'its desire' and u ntaa 'enough/its
size' .

                 to accompany the bishop
                 and work for him there?
   When yi 'desire' is followed by the first person singular experiencer marker a nga, vowel
harmony forces yi to become ya.

     A request to do something is handled with an appropriate imperative in the second clause.

   An invitation with some coercive force uses the normal first person imperative, but
precedes it with a desiderative clause.

  When imperatives are negated, the postnuclei take the form of those used with indicative

the verb is treated as a 'basic' or 'simple' indicative proximal verb. Thus negative imperative
status is expressed only once in the verb phrase.","[63, 64, 65]"

1 . The savage dog is called ' Peetuuki ' , and he lives at Doonge. 2. It' s nothing to do with
me. 3. It' s not my dog. 4. It' s Nkal' s dog. 5. He raised it. 6. It' s a bad dog. 7. It bites
everyone. 8-9. It doesn' t like anyone.
1 0. Recently it bit Mepe's son, Yidika. 1 1 . It really bit him hard. 1 2. Mepe became very
angry, 1 3 . and said, ""I'm going to kill that dog"". 1 4. Nkal said, ""Okay"". 1 5 . The dog ran
away into the bush, 1 6. so Mepe couldn't kill it.
17. So now it' s still there at Doonge, 1 8 . so there ' s not a safe road through there.
1 9. That's the end of my story.","[104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109]"
"   Where there is more than one third person referent on stage at a time in a discourse, the
subjects and objects are made explicit more often, to ensure that the hearer can keep track of
the referents of the clauses. (As is often the case, folk stories show less explicit reference to
the participants, because everyone knows who does what in the story, and it is not necessary
to be as explicit. Everyone knows, that is, except the linguist from another culture!). Text (d)
in §2.4 provides an example of a text with more than one third person referent on stage at a
time. It is by the same author as the fishing story referred to above. The topic of the text is a
savage dog, which is introduced and named in clause l a, then referred to with third person
singular verb parts in clause 1 b. The author disclaims responsibility in sentence 2 ,
introducing himself with a pronoun, and using the word 'dog' in sentence 3 . H e names the
culprit, his brother Nkal, with a noun, and uses the word 'dog' again in sentence 4. Nkal ' s
name is repeated i n sentence 5, but this time the other third person referent i s understood to
be the dog, without specific reference. The dog is mentioned again specifically in the next
sentence, number 6. It remains the topic of the rest of that paragraph, sentences 7 to 9, being
referred to only pronominally. Sentence 1 0 begins a narrative episode, in which Mepe and
his son Yidika are introduced by name. In this episode each sentence uses a noun to refer to
one of these actors, as the initiative moves from one third person referent to another in quick
succession. The result of the incident comes in sentence 1 7, but the dog is not mentioned
specifically - it is just the third person singular referent of the verb. The text ends with a
specific reference to a safe road for people to follow.
(2) Order of items in the clause   Apart from the subject and object of the clause, other items can be included at will when
their semantic content is to be made explicit, up to a limit of five items in any one clause,
including the predicate. The histogram in Table 2. 1 .8 . 1 shows the proportion of transitive
and intransitive clauses having each number of items. The histogram is based on a sample of
667 clauses all from texts or conversation.",[66]

straightforward, such as p for the bilabial stop and k for the velar stop. Others required some
care. For example, t was chosen to represent the dental phoneme and d to represent the post­
alveolar phoneme, because some Rossel people were already writing these sounds this way,
and because the post-alveolar stop is partially voiced word medially adjacent to a short vowel
and so it is similar to d in English. The digraph th was rejected by the Rossel people as a
representation for one of these phonemes, because the nearby Sudest language has [0] in its
inventory, and the Rossels did not want there to be any confusion with that sound. The
dental and post-alveolar nasals posed a problem, as the English alphabet does not provide
any equivalent in the nasals to t and d, so the acute accent used to mark close vowels was
borrowed and pressed into service to mark the dental nasal. The velar nasal is represented by
ng to match English usage. The velar fricative is represented on Goodenough Island by g,
but gh was chosen for the Yele orthography to avoid confusion with the symbols used for a
prenasalised velar stop uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure (mg).
  The non-dental stops are partially voiced word medially when adjacent to a short vowel.
For the post-alveolar stop, this results in a manifestation as [r] in that environment.

  There is a contrastive series of prenasalised stops, in which the speech power of the
prenasalisation is much greater than that of the stop. Hence they are referred to as the

contrasts are illustrated in Table 1.2.2.","[14, 15]"

non-nasal syllable in the same word. Such nasalisation is not written in the practical
orthography, as it is non-phonemic.","[10, 11]"

   I have analysed these as 11 basic vowel phonemes, a nasalisation phoneme and length.
   There is a gap in the distribution of the close vowels, in that non-nasalised [E] and [a]
rarely occur preceding [i] in the next syllable of the same morpheme, and non-nasalised [J]
rarely occurs preceding [u] in the next syllable of the same morpheme. The close
counterparts [e], [re] and [0] occur in these environments instead. The high vowel [i] does
not affect the quality of the vowel in the syllable before it. Tables 1.1.11 and 1.1.12 illustrate
the usual situation.

  When interpreting sequences of vowels such as [k!e] 'bite', there are no sequences of low
vowels such as * [£0] on which to base an interpretation as a sequence of two vowel
phonemes. All vowel sequences involve a high or mid close vowel, suggesting that
palatalisation, labialisation or a semivowel is involved. Palatalisation and labialisation both
contrast with sequences of a higher vowel followed by a lower vowel, as shown in Table

"(3) Incorporating the deictic ala
    The deictic ala ' this' (close to the speaker) has a parallel in a 'close ' , which occurs in the
predicate prenucleus to mark motion towards the speaker or proximity to the speaker.
Although the basic form is a, the morpheme takes a number of different forms, as presented
in the matrices A-7 and A-8 in the appendix. In some cases, a 'close' is added unchanged to
the 'unmarked' predicate prenucleus ( 1 04). (The added a is written as a separate word in the
practical orthography to avoid confusion with a long vowel within a morpheme. Where a
'close' is added, there is a pitch glide from the unmarked prenucleus down to the a, but this
does not occur with normal long vowels.)   ( 1 04) a.      [Maah      w-a       kee             dmi.

lowered to a, as a mother encourages her young child not to dawdle along. Example ( 1 07a) is

2.1.3 TENSE
   In the indicative mood, six tenses are distinguished for continuous events, but only four
for punctiliar events. Punctiliar verb roots cannot be manifested in the immediate future and
present tenses.
   This section outlines the ways in which the tenses are distinguished. Sections 2. 1. 4 to
2.1. 6 give further details.
                                                                                                21(1) Future tense   In the indicative mood, future prenuclear components are prefixed with a - 'future' and
optionally with w- 'definite situation'. (See §2. 1.7.S also.)
   (22) a.     W-a -dnyi                  mbwollmbwoli.
               D -FUT-CI.DST. 3PL.SB hiding
               They (plural) will be hiding (tomorrow).                            (continuous)
          b.   W-a     mbwoll dmi.
               D-FUT hide       IT. PI.PRX. PL.SB
               They (plural) will hide (tomorrow).                                  (punctiliar)
   The future tense with continuous events covers the period tomorrow and later, but with
punctiliar events, it covers any time after the present moment. It is also used with a second
person singular subject to express a general procedure that people follow.
   (23)        [DYUU]A a -nyi-ne                   pyidu  t6.
               heap       FUT- PI. 2SG.SB- CLS stand. up T.IND. PRX. 3PL. O.MF
               One gathers them (coconuts) into heaps.                (text (b), clause 2c)
               (lit. You (singular) will stand up heaps.)
(2) Immediate future versus present tense
   Immediate future and present forms with third person subjects usually can not be
distinguished:
  (24)         A                         mbwollmbwoll t6.
               CI.PRES/IM.FUT.3.SB hiding             IT. CI. PRX. PL.SB
               They are/will soon be hiding.                                       (continuous)
   Some people, however, mark continuous indicative present tense intransitive verbs with
third person singular subjects by changing the postnucleus from the usual 0 to ne ( 2Sa).
Similarly, equative statements are sometimes marked with ne (2Sb).
  ( 2S) a.     [Daa yoo      ngmiffil A [y:llL a                kwo
               NEG group one           there CI. PRES. 3.SB standing
               ne.
               IT. CI. PRES. 3SG. SB
               There are many groups of people there.
               (A characteristic Yele understatement - lit. Not one group is standing there.)          b.   [Gregory hop [ala ne] cOM .
               Gregory        here PRES
               Gregory is here.
Punctiliar events do not occur with present or immediate future tense, as stated above.
   With first and second person subjects, present and immediate future forms can be
distinguished:
   (26) a.     N:aa                   mbwollmbwoll.
               CI. IM.FUT. l SG.SB hiding
               I'll be hiding soon.                                          (immediate future)
22              b.   A-ni                 mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLPRES- l SG.SB hiding
                   I'm hiding (at this moment).                                          (present)
   Present tense forms are rare. The immediate future is frequently used for events that are
actually happening as well as for events that will happen soon.
(3) Immediate past and near past tenses
   The prenuclear components of immediate past and near past predicates are in a reciprocal
relationship with duration. The immediate past continuous prenuclei (27) are identical with
the near past punctiliar prenuclei (28). The immediate past punctiliar prenuclei have a stop
feature added to them (de in (29)), and the near past continuous prenuclei used with third
person subjects also contain a stop feature (dnyi in (30)):
     ( 27)         Nmi                  mbwolimbwoli teo
                   CI.IM.PST. I PL.SB hiding         IT.C LPRX. PL.SB

     (29)          De                  mbwoli dmi.
                   PI. IM.PST. 3. SB hide     IT.PL PRX.PL.SB
                   They hid (earlier today).                           (punctiliar immediate past)
     (30)          Dnyi                  mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLNR. PST.3PL.SB hiding
                   They were hiding (yesterday).                           (continuous near past)
   Near past tense is used for events that happened yesterday. Immediate past is used for
events that happened 'earlier today', but also for punctiliar events that took place earlier than
today, even into the far past, if the present effects of the events are in focus (Comrie' s
'perfect'). I n example (31) below, the fire was into the domain of the remote past by the time
the news travelled right around Rossel, but the news is conveyed in the immediate past to
show that its effects remain.
     (31) a.       [Pi    yint6mu Y:OO] E ny:ee ng6pu,
                   person all       PL.E   hear   T.PL REM. 3SG.O.PF
              b.   ape,      [N:aa Teepwe yi p:o, l L
                   they.said N: iiii Teepwe their home
              C.   ape,      [NdapiJ A     [nde nge] E de                   mao
                   they.said shell.money fire SG.E PI.IM.PST. SG. SB eat
                   Everyone heard that at N:aa and Teepwe's village fire had destroyed the shell
                   money.
(4) Discourse function of immediate past tense
   In a narrative set in the remote past, the immediate past is used for several punctiliar
clauses at the climax of the narrative, if the emotive content of the story warrants it. (Many
stories are told without any shift to the immediate past.) For example, in Gregory Mepe""s
narrative of his trip to Port Moresby and years of work there, he switches to the immediate
past at the point where he is met at the wharf and taken to the place where he is to live and
                                                                                              23work. In Kadawa's story of a trip to T:am for a bride-price ceremony, she switches to the
immediate past for the distribution of the shell wealth, then back to the remote past again.
This switch seems to mark the focus of the story. It is signalled by using a continuous future
prenucleus with a punctiliar verb root and postnucleus.
   (32)            [ Teetee mbwemi   kni  Y:OO] E ­

  Longacre (1972: 135f) reports a similar tense shift marking the climaxes of legends in Fore
and Waffa, Highland languages of Papua New Guinea.
(5) Remote past tense
   The one tense remaining to be described here is the remote past - events that took place
before yesterday.
   (33) a.         Dnye              mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLREM. 3PL.SB hiding
                   They were hiding (before yesterday).               (continuous remote past)
           b.      Mbwoli dniye.
                   hide    IT.PL REM.PL.SB
                   They hid (before yesterday).                        (punctiliar remote past)
(6) System of tense relationships
   The third person examples above that involve mbwolimbwoli 'hiding' are repeated
without glosses in Table 2.1.3.1 to facilitate comparison.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"

602. 1 .9 NON-VERB AL PREDICATION  Non-verbal predication involves a Topic and a nominal or adjectival Comment about that
Topic, linked together in an Equative clause. A Locative and a negative can also be present.

2.3.2 SUBORDINATION  The categories of subordination distinguished in Yele are Time, Logical relationships and
Relative Clauses.
2.3.2. 1 nME CLA USES
  By far the most frequent form of TIME clause contains dini ghi n:ii nge 'at the time

  The first two sentences of text (b) in §2.4 provide examples of subordination, of a
SPECIFIC clause and of a TIME clause respectively.
     An intended future action is expressed with daa kemakema 'soon ' , as in example (245).

alveolar contrast, and to give weight to the significance of the prenasalisation, the
prenasalised stops are represented in the practical orthography by nasal-stop pairs. Thus nt
and nd represent the dental and post-alveolar stops respectively when they are prenasalised.
mb was chosen for the bilabial stop rather than mp, because of pressure from the English
orthography. For the velar stop, ngg was first introduced, as is used in a number of Papua
New Guinea languages, but Rossel people failed to notice the second g when reading and

and has proven easy to teach.
   The post-alveolar and velar stops can also be uttered with nasal release, which is
characterised by nasal plosion. Table 1.2.3 shows these two basic stops alone, with pre­
nasalisation and with nasal release.",[15]

grand total of 94 contrastively different sounds in the language.
   Traditional phonemic principles call for the interpretation of 'ambivalent' sequences of
consonants, to decide whether they should be regarded as consonant clusters or complex
consonants. Normally one would look for clusters of heterorganic consonants on which to
base a cluster solution when interpreting prenasalised stops, stops with nasal release,
palatalisation and labialisation, but there are no sequences of consonants that do not involve
one or more of these features. Simultaneous bilabial closure involves two articulations, but
they occur simultaneously, and act as a multiplier, covering the prenasalisation or nasal
release of a stop as well as the stop itself. Clearly the 'unambivalent cluster' criterion must be
relaxed, or the sum total of consonant phonemes could approach the possible maximim of
56!
  The sequences [pY], [kY] and [mY] cited in Tables 1. 2. 6 and 1.2.7 above are heterorganic,
even though they involve palatalisation. They provide the basis for recognising consonant -
semivowel clusters. [Y] and [W] can then be regarded as allophones of y and w respectively.
Turning now to prenasalisation and nasal release, it is observed that they constitute a reverse
sequence, stop-nasal and nasal-stop, so those clusters are allowed on that basis.
   Following traditional phonemic principles, the consonants with simultaneous bilabial
closure would be set apart as separate phonemes, adding
   tp        dp      kp
   rim       nm      ngmand Iv
12to the thirteen basic phonemes illustrated in Table 1.2.1, making a total of 20 basic
consonantal phonemes.
   In this analysis a consonant would have the formula C1(C2)S, where if Cl and C2 are
both manifested, they are homorganic in the order nasal-stop or stop-nasal. The order stop­
nasal only occurs with post-alveolar and velar consonants. With bilabial consonants, S can
be manifested by yand w simultaneously.
   Non-nasal continuants are a special case, with the formula C(y), where yoccurs only with
1 and v.","[19, 20]"
"   A number of verbs are obligatorily marked 'close', even when motion does not seem to be
involved.

(4) Incorporating the deictic mu
  Another deictic which is incorporated in the predicate prenucleus is mu 'other' . The verbal
equivalent is mu- or mJ-, and it means ' in the other place' .

(5) Incorporating the deictic yi
   The remaining deictic which is incorporated into the predicate prenucleus is yi 'previously
discussed' . When incorporated into the predicate, it accentuates reference to a previously
introduced discourse participant, sometimes approximating the force of the English cleft
sentence 'He's the one that...'

2.3.3 QUOTATIONS
   All quotations are direct. There is no indirect speech. Every utterance by the one person is
introduced by a quote formula which specifies when the words were spoken, and the person
and number of the speaker and of the hearer. Typically, each succeeding clause in the
quotation is introduced by a contracted quote formula that gives the person and number of the
speaker and of the person spoken to, and the tense.   (267) a .    [Hughie nge] E ye-pe,

                But the women didn't understand properly,
                so they ran away.
                Hugh said to them,
                ""Don't run away.

purpose in being there. (There i s another example o f implied speech i n sentence 1 2 o f text (a)

   Another example of dialogue is at text (a), sentences 6 and 7 in §2.4. In sentence 8 of that
text the two following clauses in the quotation are not preceded by the contracted quote
formula, a -ka -de ' he said to me' . It is obvious that the quotation continues, because of the
second person verb parts. This text was originally written, not spoken, and there is a
tendency in written material not to use the quote formulae as frequently as in spoken
discourse.
   Quoted speech is common in narrative, but rare in procedural, hortatory or explanatory
discourse types. Text (d) in §2.4 is explanatory, and contains quoted speech in an embedded
narrative episode (sentences 10 to 1 6) .
                                                                                                  87   Table 2 . 3 .3 . 1 illustrates some of the quote formulae used before each quoted clause in
speech.","[93, 94, 95]"

  Although <16-> is frequently used in conversation, it is generally only used at the first
opportunity in a monologue, quoted speech excepted, of course. Text (a) in §2.4 is a good
example.
(2) Incorporating the deictic wu   The future counterpart of certainty ( 'in sight') is definiteness ( w-), from wu 'out of sight ' .

examples in this section.
( l ) CONTRAST
   ""The relation of CONTRAST occurs between two communication units when there are at
least two points of difference between them and one point of similarity. One of the points of
difference involves an opposition"" (Beekman et. al. : p. 1 00). A simple example of contrast
where the clauses are juxtaposed without indicating the semantic relationship is:   (247) a.    [Daa] NEG [a w:aa. JcOM
               not         my dog         b.    [Nkal u       w:aa. JcOM                                    CONTRAST to (a)
               Nkal his dog
               It' s not my dog.
               It' s Nkal' s dog.
  The two points of difference are: (a) not my, and (b) 0 Nkal' s. The point of similarity is
w:aa 'dog ' . These two clauses are sentences 3 and 4 of text (d) in §2.4.
   A similar example of CONTRAST is between the two clauses of sentence 5 in text (c) in
§2.4, where the Topic is constant in both clauses, and the two differences are in the Time
and Comment positions.
80  A possible example of the CONTRAST relationship, where the contrast is with an implied
expectation, is:     (248) a.     [A p:aa        peek di                          Je,

                  I went home,
                  but I didn't see anyone.
   This sentence, however, may only illustrate the ADDITION relationship, with the second
clause simply giving the next event in the narrative.
    The CONTRAST relationship can be made explicit with the conjunction ngmene 'but' as
in the following examples.     (249) a.     [Kpemi k:ii              ntee te-ni,J cOM

(2) REASON-RESULT    The REASON clause usually precedes the RESULT clause, often without being marked
in the surface structure. For example:
     (25 1 ) a.   [Dnyintel M a          w:ee           ngopu,

                  They didn't understand,
                  so the women ran away.
   Similar examples are at text (a), sentences 1 - 5 and text (d), sentences 1 0- 1 2, where the
final sentence is the result of the preceding sentences listed in each case.

   Note that in ( l OSc) the a has been absorbed into the prenucleus dpo. The environments in
which this absorption takes place can be discerned by comparing Table A-3 in the appendix
with Table A-7, and AA with A-S .

'close' also changes the certainty marker to ka.     ( 1 09) a.    Ki 100.

of the first person form.

   A second strategy is followed in Yele for marking motion towards the reference point, and
that is to add <-ne> 'close' to the 'basic' form rather than adding a. « -ne> is manifested by
-de following dPl, by -ne elsewhere.) This strategy is used with the following categories of
tense, mood, aspect and Subject identity:
      A continuous immediate future and continuous proximal habitual forms with non­
        third person subject ( 1 1 1 ). (With third person forms the prenucleus is wune ( 1 1 2) . )
        (This is analogous t o K in §2. 1 .7.4 above.)
      B: continuous immediate past indicative and punctiliar indicative forms in which the
         last syllable of the unmarked prenucleus contains a palatalised nasal, either a nasal
         continuant ( 1 1 3 ) or nasal release ( 1 1 4).

   Yele ( also referred to as Yela and Yeletnye) is spoken by about 3,300 people, the
inhabitants of Rossel Island in the Milne B ay Province of Papua New Guinea. It is non­
Austronesian, sharing only 6 per cent of cognates with the nearest Austronesian language,
Sudest. (See Henderson and Henderson 1 974.) No close relatives of Yele have been
identified.
   This monograph describes the phonology and grammar of the language, highlighting the
portmanteau orthography and portmanteau interaction of tense, mood and aspect i n
predications. The grammatical description is b y prose statements, the analytical insights
being drawn mainly from Tagmemics and Functional Grammar (Dik 1 978).
  A preliminary description of the Yele language was published in 1 975 ( Henderson 1 975).","[2, 3, 4, 5]"

"(4) Reason
   Reason can be expressed at clause level with u (l:ee) dly:o 'on account of' . A dependent
pronoun is obligatory, but the morpheme 1:ee is optional . Its use seems to be a matter of
idiosyncratic style.

(5) Accompaniment
   The viewpoint is different from English in that Yele uses the accompaniment slot to
specify more explicitly the subject of a clause, and the verb agrees in number and person
with the combined party, from the speaker' s point of view.

(6) Location  Location in general is expressed without any marker. For verbs which do not imply
motion, it is the location where the event takes place.","[76, 77]"
"   Where events in the past are the REASON for a current and continuing RESULT, the
RESULT clause is marked with awede 'today ' . The following example is from text (d),
sentences 16 and 1 7.
   (252) a .   [Mepe nge] E [ w:aa mbwame] A -
               Mepe      S G . E dog    neck
               me-depe                            chapwo.                            REASON for (b)

               Mepe didn' t c u t its throat,
               so it is still there at Doonge.
(3) MEANS-RESULT   The MEANS-RESULT relationship is similar to the REASON-RESULT relationship,
but MEANS implies that someone intends the RESULT to take place. Example (253) is from
text (d), sentences 1 5 and 1 6.
  (253) a.     [ W:aa] A mJ                       mb€pe wo, -

               again-PI.REM. 3 .SB .NEG cut
               The dog ran into the bush,
               so Mepe wasn't able to cut its throat.
   Another example shows the use of awede 'today' to mark a continuing state arising from
an origin story.

               He sent coconuts to every place,
               so now there are plenty of coconuts all over the island.
(4) MEANS-PURPOSE
   MEANS-PURPOSE is similar to MEANS-RESULT, but the event with the PURPOSE
relationship is intended, not necessarily realised. In Yele the PURPOSE clause is expressed
as an imperative.

                 Hens are kept i n a cage

   Since a negative habitual carries the force of a negative imperative, PURPOSE can also be
expressed with a negative habitual, as in (256b) . (This example is taken from text (b) ,
sentences 1 0 c and d.)
     (256) a .   [Mb:aamb:aa nge] M w-a-nyi                  ye,

                 You put it well,
                 so that moisture will not get inside it.
(5) CONDITION-CONSEQUENCE     This relationship is frequently not marked. For example:
     (257) a.    [Mb:aamb:aa nge] M a-nyi                    vyoko,             CONDITION of (b)

                 If you dry it well,
                 you 'll get a good price for it.","[89, 90]"
"   Example (39a) is typical of noun incorporation, while (39b) shows how the noun cannot
be incorporated if specified in some way, in this instance by a possessive pronoun.
     (39) a.      Ni-mo                     mbwaa vy:emi.

   Many verbs with incorporated nouns represent ""activities recognized sufficiently often to
be considered name-worthy in their own right"" (Mithun 1 984:848). Some examples are:
   (40) a.       tpile gheeghee
                 thing washing
                 plate-washing

                 fish following

Others seem to be coined afresh by speakers as needed:   (4 1 )        Nmee-n:aa             yi.paa paapaa.

                 The bishop keeps sending me letters.
B oth examples (4 1 ) and (42) incidentally also illustrate the incorporation of compound
nouns.
   While noun incorporation usually involves transitive verb roots, there is a small set of
intransitive verb roots which incorporate a Goal, along with the Goal marker, <ka>. Example
(43) shows the root vyu wo 'look' with its goal not incorporated, and (44) shows two goals
typically incorporated with this verb.

28   Example (45) below shows a verb with incorporated Goal, which does not occur in un­
incorporated form. It names the traditional activity of cooking food in a ground oven, which
has been replaced to quite some extent by cooking in store-bought pots. Perhaps in the past it
could be un-incorporated.","[34, 35, 36]"

the person of the object, then the duration, mood and tense of the event. After that the person

can easily be seen. With the third person objects, dual and plural are nearly always marked
with forms containing d and t respectively.
( 1 ) Monofocal versus polyfocal subject    Many of the forms show a consistent pattern where for any number of object, one form is
used if the subject is first person or singular, and a different form is used with other subjects.
The forms used with a third person object and indicative proximal events or with punctiliar
habituals provide an example of this phenomenon. If the subject is first person or singular,
the postnucleus is @ for a singular object, de for a dual object or te for a plural obj ect. For
subjects other than first person or singular, however, the corresponding forms are ngme,
d:oo and t:oo respectively. Deibler ( 1 964:23) and Young ( 1 964:47-49 and 1 97 1 :22-23) have
termed these monofocal and polyfocal forms in describing Gahuku and B ena-bena
respectively, Papuan languages of the New Guinea Highlands. Table 2 . 1 .6.3 highlights this
phenomenon, showing how a third person plural object is affected by the person and number
                                           ,
of the subject in 'X ate them (yesterday) .","[45, 46, 47]"

   Possession is expressed using the appropriate dependent pronoun from the set displayed
in Table 2.2.2. 1 . (They are termed 'dependent pronouns' rather than 'possessive pronouns' ,
because they have other uses, such as for anaphoric reference in postpositional phrases.)                             TAB LE 2.2.2. 1 : DEPENDENT PRONOUNS

   In the imperative mood, punctiliar verbs display two tenses, an imperative to be obeyed
immediately and a deferred imperative, which is not to be obeyed until a later time.
Continuous imperatives, however, show no distinctions in tense. Imperatives with second or
third person subjects have a prenucleus of dpi if the action is not to be performed
immediately, compared with zero prenucleus when the action is to be performed straight
away.

third person imperatives.

(9) Tenses in habitual mood
   In the habitual mood, continuous verbs show a contrast between events that habitually
take place at present (designated as proximal tense) and events which used to take place in the
past but which do not take place at present (designated as distal tense). There are no future
habituals in Yele. Punctiliar events have no distinctions of tense in the habitual mood. (See
examples ( 2 0b) and ( 2 1b).)
   The predicate prenuclei used with continuous habitual events taking place at present
(proximal tense - see ( 37b» are identical to the prenuclei used with immediate future
indicative events (a proximal tense - see (37a» , while the distal habitual prenuclei (38b) are
derived largely from the distal indicative prenuclei (38a) with the addition of the suffix -mo
'distal habitual'. The details are presented in §2. 1.5.   (37) a.    N:aa                  lepi.

2. 1 .7.2 COMMONALITY
   Where a predication parallels a previous predication in some way, the morpheme mye
'also' is merged with the predicate prenucleus. In example (76), the Agent and the event are
the same in both clauses, but the Patient differs.
     (76)    a.   [A mailbaglA [k:umul M noD                tpye.
                  my mailbag   in.the.hand CI.REM . l SG.SB holding

                 saw body in.the.hand also-CI.REM. I SG.SB holding
                 I was holding my mailbag in (one) hand, and the saw blade in the other.
   This morpheme can also be used with the force of English 'still', as in example (77).
   (77) a.       [ U chine] A ghay wo,                   [nt:ee,k
                 his nephew fall       IT. PI. REM. 3.SB lagoon

          c.     me        teme wo,

          d.     mye-di'-mJ       m6du...
                 also-NEG-other saw
                 His nephew dived into the lagoon, but didn't see the clam...
                 he dived again, but still didn't see it...
    Examples (76) and (77) illustrate uses of mye- where it is prefixed to the predicate
prenucleus without change. In a number of combinations of TMA and Subject Person,
however, mye- is merged into the prenucleus to produce a new portmanteau morpheme, as
illustrated in Table 2. 1.7.2. 1.","[50, 51]"
"( 1 ) Presence of explicit subjects and objects
    Since the prenuclear and postnuclear components of the Yele verb mark the subject and
object of the predication so fully, these referents are frequently not specified by nouns or
noun phrases. Typically, they are made explicit where they enter a discourse, or where the
referents change, and elsewhere are carried just by the markers in the verb. For example, text
(a) in §2.4 introduces the author in the verbal prenucleus of clause 1 , and thereafter his
identity is carried by the verbal markers. He introduces his brother Nkal by name in clause
6a, and the quote formulae in their conversation keep track of the speakers. Nkal refers to
fish with a noun in 6c. Third person objects are introduced with nouns in clause l Ob 'I didn't
see anyone' and 1 1 b 'I chewed some betel nut' . The author refers to his father with a kin
58term in 1 2c, and quotes h i s father' s use o f h i s own name in 1 3b. H i s father also mentions
fish with a noun, in 1 5b.","[65, 66]"

   Note that with continuous aspect, postnuclear te is used only with the three tenses closest
to the speech act: present, immediate future and immediate past. Similarly , with punctiliar
aspect, postnuclear dmi is used with the three tenses closest to the speech act: future,
immediate past and near past. This pattern is also evident with transitive predicate postnuclei,
so for each duration the three tenses closest to the speech act are termed 'proximal'. Remote
past differs clearly from the proximal tenses, not only in peripheral components of the
predicate, but also in verb root selection, as shown in sections 2. 1. 4 to 2.1. 6 below. The
24remaining two tenses used with continuous aspect (future and near past) are termed 'distal'.
Their peripheral predicate components are identical except that the future is marked with a­
'future' to distinguish it from near past. Table 2. 1.3.2 represents this division of tenses
diagrammatically.","[31, 32]"

important person is placed first, and the speaker places himself last.
