9.5.1.1. Polar interrogative clauses
          The function of a polar interrogative clause is to ask an addressee whether he or
she believes a particular assertion made by the speaker to be in fact the case (‘yes’) or not
(‘no’).
          In Galo, polar interrogatives are formed according to one of three basic patterns,
all of which are based closely on (i.e., do not involve significant reorganization of) main
declarative clause syntax.
1) tag particles
2) interrogative particles
3) preferred inflections9.5.1.1.1. Tag particles          The simplest and most frequent means of forming a polar question is via one of a
variety of tag particles, all of which occur as enclitics to a main declarative clause (in any
person). Most tag particles represent intonational and/or segmental variants of a
“versatile” particle with the core segmental form (ʔə)i, with correspondingly differentpragmatic implications (described in §13.5.1), and may in turn be supplemented in their
                                         3069H
use by phrasal intonation. The tag particle may directly follow the copula/predicate, or it
may follow any other occurring particles, including interrogative particles (§9.5.1.1.2).
                                                                                 307H
The resulting construction has the overall sense of an assertion whose validity the speaker
wishes to check with the addressee. It and all other polar questions may be answered in
mm ‘yes’ or máa ‘no’, and/or in a repetition of the questioned clause (or some portion
                                                 436

13.7.1. Calls and responses to humans

vocatives (§13.6.2), which occur as enclitics to a term of address, the following Galo

13.3.3.2. Dubitative larèe       Dubitative larèe ‘DUB’ has the same distribution as Polar interrogative ree. Itindicates speaker surprise at seeing an indication that the marked information is or should
be the case, and forms an insistent polar question to verify whether it is or is not so (in
principle, probably expecting a negative answer) (791). In cases where the speaker and
                                                    4083H
addressee both know quite well that the marked information is not and can not be the case,
the sense is closer to a rhetorical question, possibly with disapproving and/or mirative
overtones; if (792) were marked in simple Polar interrogative particle ree ‘PQ’, it would
              408H
inappropriately suggest the speaker’s earnest ignorance as to whether or not his addressee
(in this case his son) was in fact insane.

       The second formative of Dubitative larèe clearly reflects Polar interrogative ree,however the initial formative is unknown. Although Dubitative larèe occurs relativelyinfrequently in my corpus, it is commonly believed among my consultants that Dubitative
larèe is namesake of the Lare (larèe) dialect of Galo which forms the focus of this                                             652

                Hesitation mane is an ubiquitous form of the Assam plains, reflecting Assameseman- ‘mean’ + -e ‘Third person subject’. It is as addictive an expression as may be found
in any language, on a par with American English like and every bit as distasteful to
language purists. Usually translatable via English like, I mean or that’s to say, maneoccurs clause-initially or -finally in Galo of the foothills area, and also as a general
hesitation word. However, unlike native Galo hesitation words such as məráa (§13.7.6),      4105H
mane cannot stand as a “pro-lexeme”. Use of mane is less widespread outside Assamese
contact areas, although it is probably more widespread than many Galo seem to have
hoped (809).

13.5.           “Versatile” particles
                “Versatile” particles form a small, closed set, and are so-called due to their ability
to occur in an especially wide variety of contexts, both constituent-finally and, in some
cases, constituent-internally. Most have a basically emphatic function, and are used to
draw extra attention to certain clausal and/or phrasal constituents. However, most do not
occur as markers of a cleft/focus construction. Some versatile particles have
homophonous and semantically relatable forms in other form-classes; depending on the
analysis, one could either describe such forms as (probably) diachronically related but
synchronically distinct, or else as constituting a perhaps even more versatile class of
particles than is being envisaged here. Although the first of the two approaches is the one
more consistently taken in this grammar, in the interest of descriptive completeness the
full potential distribution of the versatile particles is presented in subsections below
(Table 13.8).

Table 13.8 – Versatile particles
13.5.1. Emphatic, focal, and polar question marking particles with formative i         There is a large set of Galo forms seemingly organized around a basic formative i,whose functions are probably relatable and may ultimately permit reduction (whether in a
synchronic or a diachronic sense) to a basic form (ə)i ‘Emphatic’. Variations, bothfunctional and phonological, would then be viewed as products of syntactic position and
scope as well as, potentially, of prosodic expressivity. At the same time, there is certainly
evidence that form-function specialization either has occurred or is in the process of
occurring, and not all possible phonological shapes seem to be permissible in all syntactic
positions/functions. 252 In what follows, three basic form-function categories are described,
                       251F
with the caveat that a certain amount of formal and functional “spillover” occurs between
them, and may ultimately reflect the existence of an “underlying” relationship of some
kind.
         Emphatic (ə)i ́ occurs as an enclitic to any non-final constituent, seemingly withlocal scope. Its basic function is to highlight or draw additional attention to the constituent,
as though to increase a sense of precision or importance. When marking a noun phrase,
Emphatic (ə)i ́ conveys a sense of ‘precisely (this)’, ‘right (then/there)’ or ‘(this) and
252
   I have asked numerous consultants on numerous occasions whether one form in i is ‘the same as’ or
‘means the same as’ another, and found the range of possible answers to be almost unlimited, and equally
unlimited in their potential for cross-contradiction!

        When marking a predicate, Emphatic (ə)i ́ has the unusual property of occurringwithin the predicate complex, either following the predicate word and preceding any
particles, or else (and more often) interrupting the grammatical predicate word (see §10.6           418H
for discussion of this phenomenon in a more general context). In either case, the position
of (ə)i ́ is always clitic to the left edge of a phonological word – it cannot occur within aphonological word (811)-(812).

    (ə)í occurs with far greater frequency in the speech of Galo living in foothill areas than in the higher
areas, and with far higher frequency in the speech of my female consultants than in that of males. Its usage
is believed by some of my consultants to derive from mimicry of plains languages – a plausible claim which,
however, I have not been able to properly verify. Some of my consultants consider Emphatic particle use or
overuse to be bad form or to constitute low-register speech, although its use is certainly addictive; I have
been personally scolded on several occasions for my unseemly imitation of these patterns!

attitude (813)-(814) (also cf. §13.2.2.3 ex. (713)).

        Emphatic tag (ə)ì follows predicates, including any and all particles which may beassociated to it. It does not mark cleft/focal NPs. Its basic function is to “check” that the
addressee is following and/or agrees with the speaker. By implication, it usually forms a
polar question which differs somewhat in feel from a polar question in ree (§13.3.3.1);

the S complement clause predicate head kú- denotes a type of fishing traditionallyfavoured by Galo women, in which a conical basket trap (raazùu) is placed between the       fisher’s legs, with the mouth facing a large stone. When the stone is lifted, shellfish
       hiding under the stone are frightened into the basket, which is then raised and drained.
       Only shellfish are caught using this method. In this sense, we can say that tahúm‘shellfish’ denotes a type of entity prototypically associated with the event or state
denoted by the predicate.

              ‘Can (that river) be fished for crawdads?’ (RmR, CC 102)              Prototypically predicate-collocated nominals run a fine line between syntactic
argument and compound-element-like or incorporated status (Mithun 1984). For example,
predicates in kú- almost always occur with an adjacent, bare noun tahúm ‘shellfish’ as in(914); although I have found it possible in elicitation to mark the noun tahúm in the
431H
accusative in sentences like (914), thus establishing kú- as – potentially, at least – a

       transitive verb root capable of taking tahúm as its O argument head, my consultantsassured me they would never actually speak this way. In natural speech, kú- would almostnever be uttered in absence of collocated tahúm, and tahúm would almost never be case       marked.
              In other cases, we find prototypically predicate-collocated nominals occurring
       with predicate types which are very clear in being able to take a wide variety of S/A or O
       arguments; in this case, however, collocated arguments may occur as a means of limiting

         The occurrence of non-case-marked acín ‘cooked rice’ in (915) limits the

denotational range of dó- ‘eat’ to one of its potential senses ‘having a meal’, inasmuch as‘cooked rice’ is the prototypical entity associated with the event type ‘eat a meal’ in Galo
culture. As such, it is possible to correctly answer әәm, dó-bée ‘yes eat-EPF’ ‘yes, I have’to (915) even if one has on some rare occasion in fact eaten roti bread rather than rice – if
  435H
the roti constituted one’s meal rather than a snack – and one might just as easily ask the
question in (915) as a means of making polite conversation even if one were perfectly
             436H
aware that one’s addressee did not eat rice for his meal, etc.
         Thus, one might suppose that acín-donám ‘cooked.rice-eat.NZR:RLS’ represents alexicalized, compound-like association between noun and verb, rather than a clause-level
argument-predicate relation per se, and this is certainly true to an extent. But it is always
possible to case-mark a prototypically-associated nominal if the sense intended is
somehow contrastive. So, for example nó acín=əəm dó-bée? ‘2.SG cooked.rice=ACC eat-EPF’ ‘have you eaten the rice ~ have you ever eaten rice’ might be asked if a speaker wasgenuinely wondering if his addressee (presumably a non-Galo) had ever eaten rice before
in his life (assuming there to be any number of other unspecified things which he has
eaten), and/or was aware that the addressee had been served a variety of foodstuffs (as at
a banquet) and was wondering if he had eaten the rice yet (as distinct from whatever else
was known to be available).
         Uses of prototypically predicate-collocated nominals abound in Galo discourse.
Although they most commonly reflect an underlying O argument of the predicate, many
other types of relation are also attested. For example, in isì-hú-nam ‘water-wash.body-NZR:RLS’ ‘to bathe’, isì ‘water’ is an underlying instrument of the verb, as shown in ŋóisì=әə alə̀=əəm hú-rә́ ‘1.SG water=TOP foot/leg=ACC wash.body-IRR’ ‘I’m going to
wash my feet with water (as opposed to a chemical solution, etc.)’. In (916) below, the

sense of láa- ‘take’ is ‘marry’, a transitive sense in which A is ‘(male) marrier’ and O is‘(female) married (in the sense of having been taken into the family)’. Nominals
prototypically-associated with the ‘marry’ sense of ‘take’ such as ɲimә́ ‘wife’ can bemarked in the accusative if, for example, contrastive with ɲamә́ә ‘daughter-in-law’ (aswhen clarifying that one is speaking from the groom’s perspective rather than from the
perspective of an elder male of the groom’s family). In (916), however, note that the O
                                                                           438H

If ɲimә́ ‘wife’ were case-marked under these conditions, it wouldhave to be marked in the dative. However, rather than considering ɲimә́ in (916) to occur  439H
as a (zero-marked) E or oblique noun phrase, it may be preferable to consider it as weakly
incorporated into and/or compounded to the predicate, in the sense of functioning simply
to restrict or disambiguate the sense of ‘take’ intended (without which, it would be
understood that the A argument referent ‘took’, i.e. picked up, a dried-up oko leaf). The
concept of weak “incorporation” is also discussed in §5.3.2.1.     4350H

non-case-marked, predicate-adjacent nominals are understood as generic, non-referential
syntactic arguments or as elements of a lexicalized collocation with a particular predicate
type. In fact, the latter category is probably productively fed by the former, and would
presumably directly relate to the existence of culturally prominent, hence frequently-

9.5.1.2. Content interrogative clauses
       The function of a content interrogative clause is to question some aspect of a state
of affairs about which some amount of detail is known, usually by replacing the
constituent of a phrase or clause which is under question with an interrogative pronoun.
Galo content interrogatives are formed according to one of three structural patterns:
       1) in-situ
       2) constituent-internal
       3) cleft/focus       Use of one or another pattern is dependent on a variety of factors, including the
type of interrogative pronoun used, the constituent being questioned, the nature of the
predicate/clause type being used to form the question (appositive, predicative and/or                                            438
subtype thereof) and the precise nature of the illocutionary force the speaker hopes to
achieve. The resulting picture is complex, and has not yet been comprehensively
investigated. The following subsections will present the basic patterns involved; a number
of the individual distributional characteristics of interrogative pronouns are also discussed
in §7.3, where their indefinite uses are also reviewed. Some additional remarks on content

question-marking particles are also found in §13.3.3. Ultimately, however, a good deal

"         Locally, a small handful of Galo have begun efforts to represent the phonology,
lexicon and grammar of their language, with varying levels of success. The Itanagar-
based Galo scholar Toni Koyu has led an admirable attempt to develop a wholly
indigenous script “Tani Lipi”, which is based primarily on Galo phonology but is claimed
to represent the phonologies of all Tani languages. His efforts are supported by many
Galo, but due largely to practical difficulties associated with learning and implementation,
his script has not achieved broad usage as of this writing. Duri Taipodia, a poet and singer23
  The description is short and concise enough to enable us to address its most serious errors: 1) “genitives
after noun heads”: if “genitive” means “genitive phrase”, genitives are overwhelmingly pre-head in my data
(§6.1.2.2.3) 2) “relatives after noun heads or without”: if “relative” means “relative clause”, pre-head
relatives are statistically more common in my data, and post-head relatives may in fact be better analysed as
internally-headed (§15.3.1.3) 3) “question word initial”: if “question word” indicates a “question marker”,
these are obligatorily clause-final in my data; if “question word” indicates an “interrogative pronoun”, these
typically occur in-situ, and/or in a focus construction (potentially preceded by other syntactic constituents)
(§9.5.1) 4) “maximum prefixes 2”: there is at most one (usually non-productive) prefix on any Galo word in
my data (§5.3.1.1) 5) “nontonal” is wildly wrong as an overall description of Galo, as has been clear since
the well-known work of Weidert (1987) (§4.1.3.2).

residing in Likabali town and a native speaker of the Taipodia dialect, has produced an
orthography and a small primer for use in local schools (with a grammar and dictionary
reportedly in the works). He may be credited for making efforts to represent the vowels /ɨ/
and /ə/ (using the symbols ⎧ and ξ respectively), and for representing vowel length in
non-word-final syllables, both of which are usually ignored by casual writers of Galo.
Nevertheless, the prospects of his work attaining any reasonable stage of completeness
over the coming years are uncertain.
       The capable Shillong-based Galo Reverend Gode Doke (goodə́ə dokèe) has, under
the auspices of the Galo Baptist Christian Council, (GBCC) (partnering with the Bible
Society of India (BSI) and the Christian missionary organization Summer Institute of
Linguistics (SIL)), recently developed a Roman-based Galo script and a small number of
school primers in the context of an ongoing Bible translation project. While the script is
admirable in its representation of vowels ɨ and ə (using symbols ü and ë respectively), the
SIL operative(s) assigned to the task of advising the GBCC do not appear to have
conducted a full study of Galo phonology, and have accordingly failed to offer the expert
advice on some of the more difficult aspects of phonological representation (such as
tonality, length contrasts, underlying versus surface aspects of phonological form,
consistent representation of word boundaries, etc.) that would have justified their work
with the Galo from a purely linguistic perspective. Beyond these technical concerns,
however, there would seem to be larger and more worrisome social, cultural and political
problems associated with sectarian sponsorship and facilitation of language development
programs. The fact is that the GBCC/BSI/SIL project is not community-authorized, and in
fact stands in open opposition to community-authorized, non-sectarian, literacy programs.
Not in a position to conduct proper socio-linguistic surveys within Arunachal Pradesh,
SIL is unable to justify its choice of “partners” in terms of the actual needs or desires of
the broader community, and potential sources of intra-community conflict are thus not
recognized, or if they are, they may be disregarded. Being a missionary organization, the
ultimate goal of SIL is of course conversion of indigenous peoples to Christianity, and, in
turn, encouragement of the obsolescence of traditional belief systems and associated
cultural practices. Performing under-researched and under-committed linguistic work in
partnership with explicitly sectarian organizations potentially threatens social cohesion
and quite likely under-serves the actual literacy needs of the public; at the same time, it
could be seen to accord quite well with SIL’s ultimate sectarian goals. Conversations with
SIL’s area directors on behalf of the Galo Welfare Society (GWS) – the principal non-
sectarian Galo representative body – have for now led to a moratorium on such activities
as the GWS begins to mount its own, community-authorized and state-supported literacy                                              69
program. However, a full and permanent resolution remains elusive at the present time of
writing.
       Finally, a group of concerned Galo based in dɨpə́ (Dipa) village, lɨɨkàa-balíi(Likabali) town and in the Arunachali capital, Itanagar, have with the assistance of this
author developed a script which I believe to represent Galo phonology with sufficient
accuracy for the first time, and which has recently been officially adopted (and further
developed) by the Galo Language Development Committee of the Galo Welfare Society –
the principal (non-sectarian, non-governmental) representative group of the Galo people.

        In our discussion of phonological words in §4.1.3, focus fell principally on
disyllabic sequences, which constitute in a sense “prototypical” phonological words.
Despite the fact that most Galo lexemes are also disyllabic, it is of course possible to
encounter trisyllabic sequences; within the noun phrase, disyllabic lexemes are commonly
followed by case enclitics such as əə ‘TOP’ and lo ‘LOC’, and within the predicate complextrisyllabic sequences such as káa-kèn-dùu ‘look-GOOD/EASY-IPFV’ ‘good-looking;beautiful’ are commonplace. While there is never doubt that such sequences constitute a                                              174
phonological unit of some kind, it is sometimes very difficult to discern whether they are
to be treated as one phonological word, or as two.
       Applying the criteria for phonological wordhood summarized in Table 4.1, we
find a certain degree of indeterminacy. Consider the two predicates of (32).
(32)   `kaanəmə́…`bɨ ̂ɨ `caalên `dù.
       káa-nam=əə        bɨ ̀ɨ  càa-lèn-dùu
       look-NZR:RLS=TOP 3.SG ascend-OUT-IPFV
       ‘Having looked…(I saw that) he was leaving for the upper (village).’
In (32), the nominalized, topicalized predicate káa-nam=əə very likely constitutes asingle phonological word. No glottal stop or pause intervenes at the clitic boundary
(between nominalizer and Topic marker), internal rhyme-reduction occurs due to
resyllabification and syncope, and primary stress occurs on the initial syllable only. Now,
however, consider the final predicate. Here again, we have a trisyllabic sequence, but the
syllables seem less well-integrated as a single “word”. Again, no significant pause
interrupts them, but primary stress falls on both càa- and -dùu. Native speakers may writekáa-nam=əə as a single orthographic word, but usually write càa-lèn-dùu as two.
       Unfortunately, there is no easy answer here. Some “word” criteria are relatively
robust, and apply to disyllabic sequences only; these include fricative and underspecified
consonant realization, (§3.2.4, §3.4.2) and the prohibition against internal pauses or
glottal stop (§4.1.3.4). However, such criteria are clearly not applicable in every case, as
when fricatives or underspecified consonants are not present in the sequence in question.
Other “word” criteria also apply sporadically to sequences larger than two syllables. For
example, assimilation sandhi (§4.1.3.7) may apply sporadically across word boundaries
(although they are never obligatory in this context, unlike within a word). Word-final
vowel length neutralization (§4.1.4.4) may or may not occur at the boundary of the
second and third syllable of a trisyllabic word, and the question of whether a particular
trisyllabic sequence represents one metrical foot (with one stress position only) or two,
and whether the two stressed slots are equal or unequal are both very difficult questions
on which I have found considerable disagreements among native speakers (see also
§4.2.3).
       For now, what may be said with confidence is the following: A phonological word
in Galo is prototypically disyllabic, although monosyllabic, bimoraic phonological words
are also admitted. Phonological units of greater than two syllables generally constitute
phonological phrases, which exhibit some but not all of the properties of phonological
                                             175
words – often in a sporadic rather than obligatory form – and which in general constitute
a relatively “looser” phonological structure. Trisyllabic phonological units exhibit
considerable indeterminacy; by some criteria, they may appear to have phonological word
status, while by other criteria they may appear to constitute a phonological phrase
consisting of two phonological words. It is certain that future research, including cross-
dialectal research within Galo as well as in its neighbours, will shed considerable light on
this matter.","[174, 175, 176]"

        Finally, with respect to “grammatical word” status, we can note that while Type C
stems can always stand as independent grammatical words, and Type A stems never can,
Type B stems usually but not always do so. Table 10.3 summarizes these possibilities.

Table 10.3 – Stem types and inflection/derivation
        On the basis of the distribution outlined in Table 10.3, one might conclude that
                                                                        3125H
while prototypically verbal (A) and prototypically adjectival predicates (C) can be clearly
distinguished, derived predicate stems (B) can be more or less verb- or adjective-like in
their behaviour. It may ultimately be possible to further subdivide derived predicate stems
into “verbal” and “adjectival” subclasses, however that has not been accomplished as of
this writing. Some additional discussion on the verbal vs. adjectival nature of derived
predicate stemps may be found together with relevant in several of the sections referenced
above, as well as in §11.

10.4.   Predicate transitivity and argument structure        A predicate projects the argument structure of a predicative clause (§9.2). The     3127H
transitivity of a predicate is in turn a function of its internal constituents. A predicate of
simple stem Type C (adjectival) is generally intransitive (§5.2.3.1). A predicate of simple
                                                                                    3128H
stem Type A (verbal) derives its argument structure directly from the lexically-specified
transitivity of the head verb root (§5.2.4.1).
                                          3129H
        A predicate of complex stem Type B may have a wide variety of transitivity
specifications, which are a product of the interaction of the head root together with its one
or more derivations. Some predicate derivations function to reduce transitivity, often as
an outcome of adjectivalization. In (397)-(398), predicate derivation -kèn ‘GOOD/EASY’

10.5.   Multiword predicates        Up to now, we have only considered predicates which are composed of a single
grammatical word, with linearly-unfolding head-dependent constituency. In this section
we discuss Multiword predicates. Multiword predicates are morphologically complex;
they are also composed of more than one phonological word, and, in a special sense to be
outlined below, may also constitute a sequence of multiple grammatical words. However,
the “words” contained in a Multiword predicate are not syntactically independent, and
cannot occur outside of a Multiword predicate construction; hence, Multiword predicates
are not describable as “serial verb constructions” or “complex predicates” in the
traditional senses of these terms.","[446, 447, 448, 449]"

interrogative main clause or cleft/focus construction (188)-(189). It may question spatial
                                                                       2604H           2605H

       this ordering contrasts with the normal post-head position of enumerative/quantitative
       modifiers in Galo (§6.1.2.1; §8.2.1). For example, an appropriate response to (190) would

of my older consultants and those residing away from Assamese contact areas have
criticized overuse of preferred inflections among some “foothills” Galo, and have
indicated to me that they in turn sometimes find it difficult to determine whether the

development will play out in the speech of future generations.","[437, 438]"

7.3. Interrogative and indefinite pronouns
        The forms discussed in this section are all available for use as interrogative
pronouns, standing for the questioned constituent of a content interrogative clause.
Content interrogative clause formation is discussed from a general perspective in §9.5.1.2.
                                                                                       2573H
Many of the forms discussed below are also available for use as indefinite pronouns in
positive and negative polarities, with senses like ‘something’ and ‘nothing’. The
interrogative or indefinite sense of a pronoun is in most cases determined by the syntax of
the clause in which it appears, together with marking by various clausal particles and,
sometimes, intonation. Very broadly speaking, interrogative force is most often obtained
through interrogative pronominal use in a cleft/focus construction (§9.4), while indefinite
                                                                            2574H
sense is obtained through in-situ use of a pronoun in construction with an appropriate
particle. However, there is much less regularity to the interrogative/indefinite alternation
found in Galo than exists in many other Asian languages; in what follows, we will to
some extent be required to take a case-by-case approach.","[333, 334]"

         Finally, in case the relative location of the referent-to-be-marked is unknown to
the speaker, or is presumed by the speaker to be unknown to the addressee (for example,
if the referent is or is located in a place or country whose name is known, but whose
location relative to the deictic centre is unknown), same level demonstratives are used as a
sort of “default”. For example, the following sentence is almost always uttered when I am
introduced to a Galo for the first time (225). 2689H

         ‘He’s from Australia.’ (Passim)Although a speaker of (225) may know very well him- or herself that Australia is
                               2690H
basically to the south of the Galo area, the riding assumption is that this fact is not
generally within the collective knowledge of Galo people; the implication is thus not that
Australia is “on the same level” as the place of speaking, but rather that Australia’s
precise location is either unknowable or is, for most purposes, a matter of little
importance.

                All Proximate and Distal simplex demonstratives appear to be etymologically
non-compositional. Hyperdistal and Megadistal forms may be described as prosodic
variants of the simplex Distal forms, and are also probably etymologically
noncompositional. All simplex demonstratives take pronominal (suffixal) case-marking
(§6.1.3).

7.4.2.2. Basic functions
                The principle function of a simplex demonstrative is to mark a referential non-
oblique noun phrase for spatial-deictic and discourse-pragmatic values, as discussed in
§7.4.1. In (226), simplex distal demonstrative (upward) tə̀ marks the CS argument of a
 269H              2697H
copula clause as spatially upward of the deictic centre. In (227), simplex speaker-
                                                                        2698H
proximate demonstrative hì marks the O argument of a final clause as a Proximal topic. 160                  159F

160
    At the time of speaking, the rice beer in question was in fact spatially downward of both the speaker and
her interlocutor, suggesting that use of the speaker-proximate demonstrative was discourse-importance-
oriented rather than spatially-oriented. It must of course be admitted, however, that in many cases these uses
overlap (for example, a referent which is near to the speaker may also be important, and vice versa), and it
is not always possible to differentiate in a particular use between these ostensibly different types of function.

       Capitalizing on its discourse-pragmatic value as a marker of Proximal topics

spatial deixis (§7.4.1.2, ex. (218); cf. also (227))), Speaker-proximate simplex

demonstrative hì has also developed the extended functionality of marking a spatiallynon-proximal referent as a Proximal topic.
       In the sequence in (228)-(229), which represents a continuous stretch of text from
                                   270H          2703H
the same speaker, note in (228) that the noun phrase referent “our place” – marked by the
                           2704H
Individuative speaker-proximate demonstrative hɨgɨ ̀ – may be simultaneously understoodas spatially speaker-proximate and topically prominent. In (229) however, a new,

spatially non-speaker-proximal discourse topic is established. A salient contrast in spatial
location motivates the speaker to shift to a distal demonstrative, which, unlike proximate
demonstratives, has no capacity to mark a proximal topic. Therefore, the noun phrase is
simultaneously marked in hì – which is now no longer interpretable as a spatial-deicticdemonstrative.

       Although dedicated use of this “Proximal topic-marking” function of hì on non-spatially-speaker-proximal noun phrases is very rare by comparison with use of the                                                                 358

Table 7.14 – Semblative/genitive demonstratives
        The structure and distribution of Semblative/Genitive demonstratives suggest a
diachronic origin in Simplex distal demonstrative suffixation by Genitive pronominal
suffix -kə̀, as tə̀-kə̀ ‘DST.UP-GEN’. Like Genitive-marked pronouns but unlike most otherdemonstratives, Semblative demonstratives take phrasal enclitics, but do not take (further)
pronominal case suffixes when occurring as the sole constituent of an argument noun
phrase; this would seemingly suggest an origin as a headless noun phrase as təkə̀=go‘DST.SEMB.UP=IND’, possibly reflecting tə̀-kə̀ Ø go ‘DST.UP-GEN (NOM) IND’. Descriptionof Semblative/Genitive demonstratives as an independent paradigm basically hinges on
the seeming lexicalization of (unpredictable) progressive vowel harmony i → ə in the                                                            359

declarative clauses in terms of basic syntax and marking. Specific indications of

speech act markers are homophonous with and probably derived historically from
aspectual suffixes. Most imperatives and hortatives are obligatorily second person in Galo,

10. Predicate complex10.1.   Overview        Chapters §10-§12 discuss aspects of the predicate complex. By “predicate
                    309H   310H
complex”, is meant a word or closely-related, tightly-clustered set of words which
together realize the head of a predicative clause (§9.2), from which clausal argument
                                                                               310H
structure and temporal-aspectual structure are projected and on which clause-level
inflections (such as Aspect and Modality suffixes) occur.
        Galo predicates are prototypically headed by a verb (“prototypically” in the sense
of having the greatest statistical frequency and greatest set of structural/behavioural
possibilities). However, the term “verb phrase” is avoided for two reasons; first, because
of the technical sense in which this term is traditionally used, namely as a high-level
clause constituent consisting of a verbal head plus a variety of other phrase- or word-level
syntactic constituents (Haegeman 1991:78-88). Clear evidence for such a high-level
constituent has not yet been discovered in Galo. Second, because it is also possible for
adjectives to stand as head of a predicate complex (see §5.1.2). Additionally, the term
                                                                                      3102H
“phrase” is avoided more here because of the normal implications of head/dependent
internal syntactic constituencies. Unlike other types of “phrases” identified in Galo
(especially the noun phrase; see §6.1.2), a Multiword predicate complex is not always
                                                  310H
clearly divisible into hierarchical constituencies in the same sense (cf. the discussion of
Multiword predicates in §10.5). Finally, we can note that clause-final particles – which
                                  3104H
often quite clearly have clause-level rather than phrase-level scope – are often difficult to
characterize as clearly “within” or “outside” of a grammatical phrase headed by the
predicate. For these and other similar reasons, the albeit somewhat ambiguous term
“complex” is preferred in this work to the more precise yet potentially misleading term
“phrase”.
        In the remainder of the chapter, §10.2 presents an overview of basic predicate
                                                         3105H
structure. §10.3 identifies three possible stem types and discusses their different
            3106H
possibilities for derivation and inflection, and §10.4 briefly discusses predicate transitivity
                                                                       3107H
and argument structure. In §10.5 we discuss more complex “Multiword predicates”; §10.6
                                          3108H                                               3109H

         More often than not, Assertive da follows Evidential ben, with which it may be inthe process of fusing as a unit. While a clause in simple Evidential ben has a “non-committal” feel, as though the speaker were simply presenting information for which

9.4. Cleft/focus constructions
             A cleft/focus construction is a formally and functionally marked construction
which exhibits structural featues of both predicative and appositive clause types. In a
prototypical cleft/focus construction, a single, pragmatically important constituent of an
appositive or predicative clause is marked as “focused” by one of a wide variety of
clause-final particles and often (but not obligatorily) “set off” from the remainder of the
clause via left-dislocation. In terms of this construction, the focused constituent will be
referred to as the “marked focus” and the particle which marks the focus as the “focus
particle”. The remaining constituent will be referred-to as the “topic”; schematically: [[x

PCL]FOC [y]TOP] ‘[[it is x]FOC [that y]TOP]’.     19F
             We first discuss the relatively less-marked case of underlyingly appositive clauses
in §9.4.1, then turn to more marked cleft/focus constructions based on underlyingly
      301H
predicative clauses in §9.4.2.
                             302H
9.4.1. Appositive cleft/focus construction
             The focus of an appositive clause canonically occurs to the right (i.e., in (V)CC
function), and does not necessarily require any special focus marking (§9.3.1). That fact30H
199
    This is not to say that individual adjectives cannot be zero-derived for use as nominals; as was discussed
in §5.1.2, many of them can. However, this property cannot be generalized over the entire adjective class;
by contrast, the ability of adjectives to occur in CC function is a categorical property of the adjective class.
200
    The sense of “focus” used here is compatible with Lambrecht’s (1994) sense, in which “focus” is defined
as any and all information contained in an assertion which significantly differs from what is presupposed,
and further depends on Dryer’s (1996) inclusion of predicates/propositions among types of information
which may be presupposed. I would tend to follow Mazaudon (2003) in reducing Lambrecht’s “predicate”
and “sentence” focus to a single propositional focus type, which Mazaudon opposes to argument focus
using the terms “broad” and “narrow” focus respectively. Ultimatly, however, my purpose here is to
describe the basic form of the cleft/focus construction, not to give an overall account of focus marking and
constructions in Galo, a project which would require more detailed research into Galo discourse
organization than has been conducted as of this writing.
                                                              430
notwithstanding, clause-final particles such as Declarative na mark the focus of anappositive clause more often than they do not, and possibly aid in disambiguating topic
from focus in what is after all a relatively formally symmetrical construction (362).
                                                                                304H
However, in an appositive focus construction, the focused constituent is fronted to the left
of the clause; in this case, the focus is obligatorily marked by a focus particle (363).

9.4.2. Predicative cleft/focus construction
       A predicative cleft/focus construction derives its basic structure from the
appositive focus construction described in §9.4.1, and again consists of two major surface
                                                   308H
constituents, the marked focus and the presupposed topic. However, a predicative                                                   431
cleft/focus construction is based underlyingly on a multi-constituent predicative clause;
       the surface, two-constituent appositive structure of the cleft/focus construction thus
       interacts with the underlyingly multi-constituent predicative clause structure in a number
       of ways.
              First, the predicate of a predicative cleft/focus construction undergoes obligatory
       nominalization by one of the “Primary” nominalizers -nà ‘NZR:SUB’, -nam‘NZR:RLS/NSUB’, -há ‘NZR:IRR’, or -kò ‘NZR:LOC/OBL’ (§15.2). The nominalized predicate
                                                                   309H
then stands as the core constituent of the clause topic; it may be uninflected/stem-based
(366) or inflected (367) (see §15 for definitions of these types).

              ‘Who might it have been who lit (this fire)?’ (KN, OLxx)
              The focus particle describes a clear boundary between the marked focus and the
topic. This is relatively easy to see in examples like (366)-(367), in which both the
                                                            304H          304H
       marked focus and the topic contain only a single internal constituent. When more than
       one constituent of the underlying predicative clause is included in the surface structure,
       they may be treated either as marked focus constituents, or as topic constituents. In most
cases, underlying predicative clause constituents will retain whatever marking they would
       have taken in the underlying predicative clause – for example, O arguments will (when
       definitely referential) be marked in the Accusative, and Adverbials will (when derived) be
       marked by an adverbializing enclitic, etc. However, underlying predicative clause
       subjects are zero-marked if and only if they occur inside the marked focus (368).
                                                                                    3045H
       Underlying predicative clause subjects which are treated as topic constituents are
       obligatorily in the Genitive (369).

               (one).’) (MN, B5:87)               It is not entirely clear why a non-focused constituent of an underlying predicative
clause can occur within either the marked focus or the topic of a predicative cleft/focus
construction, or whether there is a significant pragmatic difference between one or the
other grouping strategy (there is certainly no semantic difference). Although one might
speculate that the First person plural referent constitutes a secondary focus in a sentence
such as (368), while not at all under focus in (369), this cannot at present be demonstrated
                3047H                                  3048H
with any certainty.
               Choice of predicate nominalizer in a predicative cleft/focus construction is
generally determined by the underlying grammatical relation of the marked focus to the
nominalized predicate; that is, a focused underlying subject will tend to select for a
subject nominalizer -nà ‘NZR:SUB’, while a focused underlying O argument will tend toselect for a non-subject nominalizer -nam ‘NZR:NSUB’ (cf. §15.3.2). However, variation of
                                                                       3049H
the nominalizer is also possible, and may yield subtle and intriguing differences of
interpretation – particularly in interrogative cleft/focus constructions. For example, (370)-    305H
(371) are a minimal interrogative clause pair in which the predicate is nominalized in -nà
3051H
‘NZR:SUB’ in the first example and in -kò ‘NZR:LOC/OBL’ in the second. The denotation ofthe two sentences is basically identical; however, note that in (370), the locative/oblique
                                                                               3052H
nominalizer references the location of jùp- ‘sleep’, as might be expected given the        locative marking on the focus-marked interrogative pronoun. By contrast, in (371), the
                                                                                         305H
        subject nominalizer references the actor of jùp- ‘sleep’, despite that this is now notcoreferential with the focused interrogative pronoun. Almost impossible to translate
effectively into a corresponding English sentence pair, the effect of this alternation
appears to be to highlight the relative thematic importance of one or another clause
constituent – quite independently of the effect of focus marking and/or interrogative
                                                     433

       OL16:52)       Focused constituents sometimes exhibit non-canonical marking with respect to
their function in the underlying predicative clause, which may at least in part relate to
their basic surface status as appositive clause constituents. For instance, in (372) the
                                                                                3057H
focused noun phrase is unmarked for case, despite that it underlyingly refers to a non-
subject argument of nɨ ́k- ‘punch’. This seems to reflect the surface syntactic status of thefocused noun phrase as an appositive clause subject. In absence of case-marking, both
goal and locative construals (associated with locative/oblique nominalizer -kò) arepossible. In (373) however, the focused noun phrase is marked in the accusative, and now,
            3058H
only the goal reading is possible. This seems to relate to the usual status of semantic goals
as E (extension to core) arguments in Galo, and the association of accusative case
marking with E argument status (§14.1.3.8).

       In terms of discourse functions, interrogative cleft/focus constructions are among
the most frequent means of asking content questions (§9.5.1.2). Declarative focus
                                                                       306H
constructions are relatively rare, being generally used in cases when a speaker wishes to
draw unusually high attention to a contrastive referent, especially one whose identity was
explicitly in question. Accordingly, a declarative focus construction is the normal
rejoinder to an interrogative focus construction (374).        3061H

   Note also that the system does not appear to provide for a question with a first person subject. This
seems not to be related to conjunct/disjunct patterning as such, but rather relates to difficulties associated
with asking a first person question in the ‘Direct’ perfective -bá(a), which indicates direct experience of an
event; if anyone had directly experienced the speaker’s eating, it would surely be the speaker rather than an
addressee.

that it cannot occur as a “conjunct” cross-clause coreferentiality marker. Thus, although I
do not wish to discount my consultants’ intuitions regarding the relatedness of the Stative
imperfective and Experiential perfect in terms of subject person alternations in certain
functions, it is clear that it does not operate as a fully-fledged conjunct/disjunct pattern for
       all speakers.

12.5.3. Discussion
       By comparison with other Tibeto-Burman languages for which it has been
identified, conjunct/disjunct marking in Galo appears relatively impoverished. Not only
does it not occur in simple main clauses, it does not appear to have uniform properties in
those areas of the grammar in which it is found. Although more comparative work on
Tani languages should be undertaken prior to making any firm statements, it would seem
that, in Galo, we may be dealing with a decayed (and possibly still decaying) system
which, while once potentially robust, is now retained only in areas of the grammar in
which it seems likely to have had a relatively high functional value (such as in correlating
subject person with direct evidence of information).
       At the same time, there is evidence of a new conjunct/disjunct system arising in
the Intentional modality (§12.4.2.8, §16.6.2.2.1). Although restricted to a single modality,
                            3890H      3891H
the patterning is essentially that of a prototypical conjunct/disjunct system, and there is of
course a possibility (though nothing near a certainty) that it could eventually generalize.
       There is of course another possibility, however, and this is that conjunct/disjunct
systems arise (in some if not all languages) quite by accident. Developing in Galo (if not
in all languages which exhibit it) in at least one case from a fairly trivial process of de-
subordination through matrix predicate ellipsis, the grammaticalization of a
conjunct/disjunct system may not be motivated by any particular functional value
associated with the pattern itself – it may be simply a by-product of some functionally
quite unrelated process. Under the circumstances, it is possible that the emerging pattern
may be exploited for some functional potential which is as yet not well understood (but
which may well relate to evidentiality; see Sun (1993a) and Aikhenvald (2004:123-8)).
But it is also possible that the conjunct/disjunct pattern remains in a language as a pattern
simply because it is learned as a pattern; however, in terms of functional value, it may
have little if any at all. Such a system would be expected to decay over time, and that is
certainly what it looks like may have happened in Galo. Future research on related Tani
languages should enable us to determine whether Galo is anomalous in this respect, or not.","[607, 608, 609, 610, 611]"

11.1.6.1. Phonological factors
               As we noted in §11.1.2, the majority of simple predicate derivations in Galo are
                                327H
monosyllabic. Since predicate derivations very often follow a bound, monosyllabic verb
root – and since disyllabic sequences are usually realized as phonological words in Galo
(§4.1.3) – the sequence [VERB ROOT + PREDICATE DERIVATION] is realized as a
        328H
phonological word, and is subject to word-level stress- and tone-assignment (§4.1.3.1-    329H
§4.1.3.2), word-boundary phonotactics (§4.1.3.6) and internal assimilation sandhi
 320H                                                  321H
(§4.1.3.7). However, these rules do not, or not in the same way, apply at the boundary of
        32H
a predicate derivation in second syllable position and whatever form succeeds it. This is
demonstrated by the application of Regressive voicing assimilation (§4.1.3.7) at the
                                                                                  32H

understand here is that according to all tests for phonological wordhood currently
identified for Galo, rɨkkák and ladù in (425) constitute independent phonological words.
                                       326H
Accordingly, the predicate derivation -là(a) ‘ABIL’ is analysed as a phonologicallydependent element of the word rɨglàa in (424), and the phonological head of the word
                                              327H
ladù in (425).
       328H
11.1.6.2. Grammatical factors
       The grammatical status of “words” such as rɨkkák and ladù in (425) – and, in turn,
                                                                       329H
the grammatical status of their constituent formatives – is a more complex problem. First
consider the grammatical status of the sequence [VERB ROOT-PREDICATE DERIVATION]
([VROOT-PDER] for short) such as rɨkkák in (425):    3240H
11.1.6.2.1. Grammatical status of the sequence [VROOT-PDER] 1: “Standalone”
            utterance
       As was discussed in §5.3.2, verb roots such as rɨ ́k- ‘wash clothes’, being bound,
                             3241H
have no “standalone” sense, nor any capacity to be uttered in isolation as “words”. By
contrast, sequences of the form [VROOT-PDER] such as rɨ ́k-kák ‘wash.clothes-CLEAN’ canoften be uttered in isolation, and assigned a context-free semantic value by speakers. For
example, rɨkkák as in (425) has the standalone sense ‘wash (clothes) fully clean’, and
                      324H
rɨglàa as in (424) has the standalone sense ‘can wash (clothes)’ or ‘be able to wash
              324H
                                                             468
(clothes)’. Accordingly, disyllabic forms with the internal structure [VROOT-PDER] often
occur in wordlists, in Galo as in other Tani languages, which may suggest that they have
at least some cognitive reality as “words”. In addition, we can note the occurrence of a
few verb roots whose sense may be incomplete in absence of an appropriate predicate
derivation. For example, consider the transitive verb root cíK- ‘operate door’, which tosome consultants has no real meaning unless an appropriate Result derivation such
as -kók ‘OPEN’ or -túm ‘CLOSED’ is added. So, although cikkók ‘open a door’ and cittúm‘close a door’ are both perfectly good “words”, some consultants reject ?cinnám ‘tooperate a door’ (< cíK- ‘operate door’ + -nam ‘NZR:RLS’) – possibly because there is littlesubstance to the idea of operating a door unless one is either opening or closing it.
        We can also note a few rare but important cases in which sequences of the form
[VROOT-PDER] seem to have lexicalized. For example, kahí ‘hide’ apparently deriveshistorically from the PG sequence *ká-ɕí ‘send-REFL’, i.e. ‘send oneself’, however theerstwhile verb root appears to have obsolesced in modern Lare, and it is no longer
possible to treat kahí ‘hide’ as synchronically compositional as a result. Similarly, takàa‘ask’ may derive from tà-káa ‘obey-TENT’, literally ‘try to follow/accord with whatsomeone says’, although lexicalization and attendant semantic shift seem to have
occurred; consultants have only the vaguest sense, if any at all, of the compositionality
and semantic sub-contents of this form. In such cases, it would seem that we are obliged
to grant these (albeit not actively-formed) sequences of [VROOT-PDER] the standalone
status of “words”.
        However, we must be cautious about generalizing grammatical “word” status, in
this standalone sense, over the sequence [VROOT-PDER] as a structural type. For, although
we have seen that many such sequences may be uttered and assigned semantic values by
Lare speakers in isolation, not all may. 207 Furthermore, although it is interesting that such
                                                206F
sequences may develop strong interdependency relations to the extent that they may even
lexicalize as units, this fact does nothing to unseat a more robust generalization, which is
that the construction [VROOT-PDER] is highly productive, and is generally open to any two
semantically and functionally compatible qualifying forms. Furthermore, the fact that
collocations of [VROOT-PDER] frequently occur in Tani wordlists translating what are
207
   For example, some of my consultants have disagreed about whether takàa ‘ask’ qualifies as a “word”.
Whether this fact relates to its possible reanalysis as a bound root is an interesting question which I cannot
at present confidently answer.

often structurally and semantically simplex terms in another language may say less about
their formal and functional equivalence than it does about the lack of thoroughness with
which the analyst may have conducted his elicitation. 208         207F
        In sum, evidence from isolation utterances, from a few cases in which verb roots
derived by predicate derivations are more straightforwardly recognized by consultants as
“words” than is the same verb root in the infinitive, and from a few cases of possible
lexicalization all suggest that in some “standalone” sense, sequences of the form [VROOT-
PDER] can have the grammatical status of “words”; at the same time, it is not possible tomake a generalization to the effect that they always or necessarily do. The next section
treats their ability to pattern as syntactic words.","[467, 468, 469, 470]"

frequent occurrence with a rising-pitch tone contour – which lends itself naturally to
emphatic extensions.

              A second functional extension of jòo, quite different from the preceding, is that of       a universal pro-form with the basic semantic value ‘etcetera; and all that sort of thing; and
       so forth and so on’. This sense seems to emerge out of the potential indefinite value of jòoin a positive polarity clause, but also seems to depend on being able to occur as the
second member of an appositive construction as in (204).       2643H

Figure 7.1 – Extended functions of jòo ‘what’
               Finally, in an extended function seemingly unrelated to the above-described set of
functions, jòo ‘what’ has probably quite recently developed a clause-final use as a marker        of addressee-admonishment, used often in imperative clauses with an optional following
        particle laa ‘CQ’. According to my consultants, the understood sense is something like        ‘what (is the problem here)’, ‘what (are you prevaricating over)’ or ‘what (ill do you think
        could possibly befall you)’. However, use of jòo(laa) in clause-final position has theprosodic feel of a clause-internal constituent, quite clearly falling within the same overall
intonation contour, and may be developing into a syntactic particle in this function (208)-  2650H
(209).

7.3.5. Pronominal/pro-adjectival of quality joojòo ‘what sort’        Full reduplication of jòo ‘what’ results in a semi-compositional form joojòo,whose basic sense when standing as a noun phrase head in an interrogative clause is ‘what
sort (of thing)’; often, the implication is distributive, as though the entity under question
were plural, diffuse, or potentially various in nature (cf. also the general discussion of
reduplication in §5.5); however, the distributive reading is not necessary (210).

While statistically rare, it is also possible for joojòo to stand as a pro-adjectival, with thecorresponding sense ‘what sort (of quality)’. In (211), note that the first mention of joojòo
                                                        2654H
stands as a pro-adjectival, as demonstrated by the fact of its taking subject
nominalizer/attributive marker -nà for the purpose of modifying the O argument nounphrase head karbar ‘culture; activity’. 156 Note then that the second mention of joojòo
                                           15F
stands itself as, in essence, the same O argument noun phrase head in a restatement of the
earlier clause.","[342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347]"

marked as Locative (§14.3.5.1; see also §14.1.3.8). However, in a limited and quite rare
                             4398H         439H

non-nominalized finite/inflected clauses, but some other speakers claim such uses to be

"         Glottal stops rarely have the salience, obligatoriness, and cognitive reality to
native speakers of South-East Asian languages that other consonants have. At the same
time, they are often persistent, and correct use can in part mark one as a good or poor
non-native speaker. The question of whether or not to assign phonemic status is not only
an academic question of adding another element to the inventory, however. As Coupe
(2007:53) also points out, the presence or absence of glottal stop can provide crucial
evidence for phonological word boundaries.
         In Galo, glottal stop is almost completely absent in word-final position, generally
occurring only as a marker of emphatic speaker attitude (as in the disagreement
interjection máʔ ‘no (your presupposition is incorrect)’ (§13.7.3). Word-internally, glottalstop is never found. In word-initial position, however, glottal stop figures prominently.
Vowel-initial words are usually realized with a glottal stop onset in clear speech, blocking
onset-loan from the final consonant of a preceding term (as apə̀k-arə̀k ‘perfect-RDUP’‘intelligent’, syllabified as [ʔa.pək.ʔa.rək], not *[a.pə.ka.rək]). In running speech,furthermore, vowel-initial words are usually realized with a glottal stop onset, leading to a

evidence for locating word boundaries in Galo (§4.1.3.3), as in Ao Mongsen (Coupe
2007).
         However, the fact remains that the tendency for speakers to realize glottal stops
before vowel-initial morphemes is nowhere near as strong as the tendency to realize any
of the other consonants discussed above. Omission of glottal stop in e.g. kaí-nà (ʔ)ikìi63
   My impression, both as results from the texts used for this study and from general observation, is that this
is more true for the speech of women than in that of men, although why that should be escapes me.

11.1.6. Predicate derivations, predicate complex and the question of sub-predicate
               “words”
               The careful reader will have noticed a wide discrepancy between the surface line
of transcription in all examples given above and the parse; namely, morphemes which
look like they form initial elements of “words” in the surface line are given as bound,
right-branching dependent formatives in the parse line. Although this basic discrepancy is
related to the general problem of the disconnect between phonological and grammatical
words in Galo, discussed in detail in §4.1, there are some aspects of this problem which
                                                326H
relate crucially to the grammatical status of predicate derivations, and which therefore
deserve detailed treatment in this section.",[467]

16.3.1.3. Concessive coordination
         Concessive coordination (‘although/despite (that) x, (still/nonetheless) y’) between
two final clauses is marked in daram, a particle for which no plausible completeetymology currently exists. 302 daram occurs as a supporting clause particle/enclitic.
                                  301F
301
    Although ungrammatical in a stand-alone sense, such an utterance would be possible if it were
understood that an unspecified alternative were implied, but omitted for some reason (perhaps with an
appropriately lilting intonation); it would not be possible to interpret rəkên jaarə̀ dɨɨmá in (1060) as a final
clause in negative polarity.
302
    It is natural to suppose that the first syllable may reflect Contrastive particle da (§13.2.2.4), however the
remainder of the form seems completely obscure.

16.3.1.4. Contrastive coordination
       Simple contrastive coordination (‘x; however/but, y’) is not well-grammaticalized
in Galo. The most frequent functional contrastive coordinations are periphrastic, based on
a repetition of the preceding predicate root or a light verb rɨ ̀- ‘do; happen’, marked with aconcessive coordinating suffix such as -dakkòm or -la(a)cìn (§16.3.2.2) (1063).

16.3.2. Coordination by predicate-bound operators
16.3.2.1. Conditional coordination
              Although certain other non-final clause types are able to occur with conditional
       implications (§16.4.3.3), the only dedicated Galo conditional coordination is in -boolo – a
                      467H
form which seems to derive historically from a fusion of an earlier nominalizer *bVVplus Locative enclitic lo (§14.3.5). 303
                                     4675H   302F
              Conditional coordinator -boolo occurs as a suffix to a supporting clause predicate       root/stem (verbal or adjectival), which may or may not be inflected for aspect and polarity
(1066)-(1067).

    Jacquesson (2001) claims this construction to be one based on a synchronic nominalization. However, he
neglects to provide evidence to support this claim, which, minimally, should consist of a verb or adjective
in -boo which is capable of standing as a syntactic nominal. In fact, such formations are ungrammatical in
all Galo dialects on which I have conducted research, suggesting that while the nominalization etymology is
probably a good one, it is also probably inaccurate as a synchronic description.

         It is important to note that although -boolo is described here as a conditionalmarker, and the constructions it licenses as conditional coordinations, the
semantic/functional range of -boolo is probably somewhat broader than these terms wouldsuggest; in particular, clauses in -boolo are often introduced not as hypotheticalconditions per se, in the sense of a provisional a which, if met, would lead to b (‘if a (then
b)’), but rather to introduce unreal or counterfactual contexts (whether temporal or
logical) in terms of which a speaker wishes to predicate some fact (as in (1071)). 304                  4687H   30F

forms -dakkòm ‘CONC’ or -la(a)cìn ‘CONC’. -dakkòm ‘CONC’ seemingly derives from afusion of the Change of state aspectual inflection -dàk ‘COS’ (§12.3.2.3) with the               468H
Minyong-loaned Additive particle kòm ‘ADD’ (§13.2.2.2). Similarly, -la(a)cìn ‘CONC’ is
                                                                   4689H
derived from a fusion of Non-final suffix -là(a) ‘NF’ (§16.4.2) with native Galo Additive

particle cìn ‘ADD’ (§13.2.2.2) (1072)-(1073). Note in (1073) that -la(a)cìn ‘CONC’ is

    Note that, if the final proto-formative of -boolo is indeed Locative postposition lo, such an etymology
would argue in favour of viewing the general sense of the marker as basically “contextual” rather than
strictly “conditional”.

11.2.5.5. Manner and result applicatives
        The forms discussed in this section add some manner or result information to the
predicate, in addition to changing its core argument structure. In general, they are highly
semantically particular and infrequent in usage, and it is likely that more will be
discovered as our database increases.
         -tóm ‘APPLICATIVE: SHOW’ may be described as a manner applicative. To date, ithas only been attested on verbs in mèn- ‘say’ and káa- ‘look’ – intransitive and transitiveverbs respectively – adding a sense that the predicated event amounts to an act of
‘showing’ someone something (as when teaching someone a skill). Syntactically, it adds
an E argument – which may be marked in the Accusative/Non-agentive (like O) or else as
Dative – whose referent is understood as the ‘showee’. Although one or more core
arguments are ellipsed in all naturally-attested examples, (524) and (525) are elicited
                                                                 3508H        3509H
examples in which all core arguments are present, and which illustrate Non-agentive and
Dative marking of the added E argument respectively. Note that the E argument is not
licensed in absence of the applicative suffix in either example, irrespective of marking
type.

-tóm has no apparently related forms elsewhere in Galo.       -rɨ ́k ‘APPLICATIVE:MEET’ has a core semantic value which is similar to English‘meet’. When occurring on an intransitive predicate, it adds an O argument understood as
a referent who is ‘met’, ‘encountered’ or ‘made contact with’ by way of some action, as
in dùu-rɨ ́k ‘sit-MEET’ ‘sit and wait for someone’, dàk-rɨ ́k ‘stand-MEET’ ‘stand up next tosomeone/something’ or gə́-rɨ ́k ‘be disposed-MEET’ ‘face someone/something’; in (526),3510H

       It is common for a predicate in -rɨ ́k to also take Relexive -hí; in this case, the senseis usually reciprocal, as in dák-rɨ ́k-hí-nam ‘stand-MEET-REFL-NZR:RLS’ ‘to stand face-to-face; to size one another up’ or pá-rɨ ́k-hí-nam ‘chop-MEET-REFL-NZR:RLS’ ‘cut oneanother; fight using machetes’. -rɨ ́k ‘APPLICATIVE: MEET’ has no clearly related formselsewhere in Galo and cannot itself stand as a predicate head; however, it is almost                                             530

       -jùp ‘CAUSE.O.SLEEP’, -kàp ‘CAUSE.O.WET’ and -ŋík ‘CAUSE.O.EXTINGUISH’similarly designate a resulting state pertaining to O, understood as caused by the actor A.
On an intransitive verb, they each have the function of adding the referenced O; on a
transitive verb, they have the function of assigning a resulting, caused state to the
inherently projected O. All of the examples in (528)-(530) are based on intransitive verbs.

11.2.5.6. Locational/Relational applicatives
               The forms discussed in this section all function either to add an obligatory
argument to the predicate, or cause an already-subcategorized argument to be understood
differently. Semantically, they involve locational and/or relational meaning; their effects
are usually best translated by adpositional phrases or serial verb constructions in other
languages. The discussion of Locational/Relational applicatives in effect began in §11.2.2,   3517H
        in which they were mentioned in the context of Motion/Direction derivations. Although it
        is clear that there are certain Motion/Direction derivations which are not applicative, and
        certain Locational/Relational applicatives which are not (or not obviously) relatable to
        motion, it is at present unclear where a boundary between these two categories may be
        said to exist; this question remains for future research.
               -káa ‘APPLICATIVE: AT/ON’ is most frequently attested as a transitivizingderivation to intransitive verbs of activity such as ár- ‘glance’, cóm- ‘peek’, míK- ‘blow’,ùm- ‘grunt’, kók- ‘crow’, zə́ə- ‘shout’, góp- ‘measure by handspans’ and ɲɨ ́r- ‘laugh’
(532). Its effect is to add an non-subject argument understood as an entity ‘at’, ‘on’ or
3518H
‘against’ whom the activity denoted by the predicate is directed. (532) is ungrammatical
                                                                          3519H

               surprisingly laughing at me!) (MN, OL23:107)
It is possible that -káa ‘APPLICATIVE:AT/ON’ relates to káa- ‘look’, although this is farfrom certain.
               -tén ‘APPLICATIVE:ATOP’ is attested as a transitivizing derivation to intransitiveactivity and transfer verbs such as zə́ə- ‘shout’ and dùu- ‘sit’; it introduces a non-subjectargument whose referent is understood as affected ‘under’ the predicate semantics;
another way of understanding this is that A is understood as performing an event

        ‘Yell over to Last Brother’s Wife (to call her)!’ (MN, OLB7:15)
-tén is also attested on transitive verbs; in this case, -tén functions simply to expand therange of semantic types available to O, and/or to cause O to be understood more generally
as a Location or Goal rather than a Patient or Experiencer (534).
                                                              3521H

    If it is accurate, this analysis would appear to have implications for our understanding of the “functional
motivation” of conjunct/disjunct marking patterns. That is, while the intentional inflection in -lapə̀ might
appear superficially to be motivated by a synchronic function of marking “firsthand” or “direct” knowledge
(i.e., in agreeing only with first and second persons in statements and questions respectively), this would

16.6.2.2.2. Emergence of predictive particle
               When following a final predicative or appositive clause, lapə̀ has a predictivesense, and is seemingly not subject to any person-based constraints. It is not yet known
whether this usage has arisen as a functional extension of the stem-based inflections
discussed in §16.6.2.2-§16.6.2.2.1 (perhaps through reanalysis of the suffix as an
                       4907H           4908H
independent particle), or whether lapə̀ ‘PRD’ perhaps has an independent etymology. Thesense of lapə̀ ‘PRD’ is one of predictive assertion that the marked event will come about;        note that neither the S argument of (1171) ‘my mother’ nor the (ellipsed) CS argument of

unusual for predicate arguments, and yet this is the statistically most common position for
direct content reports. And, while at least some types of direct content reports appear to
occur clause-internally, such forms are not generally replaceable by pronouns in the same
syntactic functions. Finally, however, note in (1177) that the speaker changes speech

verbs between the first and second clauses despite the lexical semantics of the speech
event remaining quite clearly unchanged. This turns out to be necessary precisely because
of the change in complement type: while ə́m- ‘say; tell’ is subcategorized for an unmarkedclausal speech report complement (in addition to a common nominal S), mèn- ‘speak’ (inits transitive sense of speaking to an addressee) is subcategorized for a common nominal

8.2.2.4. Classifier expressions
       Bound forms of sortal and mensural classifiers are compounded to core numeral
roots (§8.2.1) and monosyllabic adjectival roots (§5.2.3.2) to form Enumerative classifier
        2876H                                        287H
expressions and Adjectival classifier expressions respectively, as bór-úm ‘CLF:SHEETS-three’ ‘three sheets (of something)’ and bór-tə̀ ‘CLF:SHEETS-big’ ‘big, of a sheet-likeentity’ (cf. also (273)-(274) above). Sortal classifiers freely occur in either Enumerative
                287H   2879H
or Adjectival classifier expressions, but many (certainly not all) mensural classifiers can
occur on Enumerative classifier expressions only. Both Enumerative and Adjectival
classifier expressions realize single grammatical and phonological words.
       The syntactic status of a classifier expression is determined by its second
constituent root. Enumerative classifier expressions in essence pattern like numerals,
although inasmuch as they cannot themselves directly modify classifiers, it may be
preferable to identify a single position in the NP syntax “Enumerator or “Enumerative
expression”, which may be filled either by a two-word sequence [CLF NUM]ENUM or by a
single term [CLF.EXP]ENUM (297)-(298).

Standing as a predicate head, Adjectival classifier expressions classify the clause subject
(300). As head of a relative clause, they classify the relative clause head; in (301), note

that dór-tə̀-nà ‘CLF:HIGH.ANIMAL-big-NZR:SUB’ stands as a headless relative clause in a       headless NP which serves as CC argument of the copula. Since copula clauses are basically
equative in Galo, this means that the classifier expression also classifies the CS argument.

         “Qualifying nouns” constitute a somewhat heterogeneous set of terms whose
principal function is to qualify the referential status or scope of an NP by limiting it,
increasing its precision, or otherwise modifying it in some way. Most qualifying nouns
are in essence subtypes of noun or pronoun, and may usually head a nominally- or
pronominally-headed NP – usually, with anaphoric or otherwise dependent reference (303).                   28H
Many also occur as the head of a “qualifying” NP in a Referential qualifying expression,
in which their host NP is apposed to a preceding “primary” NP whose reference it
“qualifies” (304) (see §6.3.2). In addition, most qualifying nouns also occur NP-internally,
             289H                 2890H
modifying a distinct NP head. In the majority of cases, NP-internal qualifying nouns are
postposed to the head (305); very rarely, they may also occur head-preposed (306). 185
                          2891H                                                              289H   184F
185
   Head-preposition of Qualifying nouns runs quite counter to the overall trend in Galo NP syntax for non-
lexical modifiers (i.e., those other than modifying nominals and genitive phrases) to be postposed to the
head. In principle, pre-head Qualifying nouns may be treated syntactically as modifying nominals (cf.
§6.1.2.1); however, this is basically an ad-hoc solution for what appears to be a genuine syntactic anomaly.
To the extent that there is any difference between pre-head and post-head position, it may be that pre-head
position signifies every (modification of a count noun only) while post-head position signifies all
(modification of either count or non-count nouns). Future research will be brought to bear on this question.

4.1.3.8. Word structure 4: Very long vowel constraint
         Sequences of more than two vowels of any quality are not found underlyingly in
any Galo roots or grammatical morphemes. In addition, such sequences are not in general
permitted in surface phonology within the same phonological word. When underlying
sequences of three or four vowels result from morpheme concatenation within a single
phonological word, a variety of possible resolutions are available.
         In the most common case, when a vowel-initial enclitic is hosted by a word with a
long final vowel, the sequence is reduced in length, but not resyllabified. Thus, for
example, ɨlɨ ̀ɨ=əə ‘stone=COP.IPFV’ ‘it’s a stone’ is realized [ɨ.lɨ.ə] (not *[ɨ.lɨɨ.ə(ə)]), andapúu=əə ‘flower=COP.IPFV’ ‘it’s a flower’ is realized [a.pu.ə] (not *[a.puu.ə(ə)]). Some
speakers are conscious of disyllabicity being maintained even when homorganic vowel
sequences are presented, as ə̀ə=əə ‘bamboo=COP.IPFV’ ‘it’s bamboo’, realized [ə̂.ə̀]; forsuch speakers, this contrasts with ə̀ə ‘bamboo’, realized [ə̀] in isolation (followingoperation of Final Length neutralization; see §4.1.4.4). 78
         Another strategy is to realize the long vowel as a vowel-glide sequence. This
strategy is mainly found in two areas: in the lexicon, forms such as pejàk ‘soybean’ haveresulted from erstwhile concatenation of VV.V sequences (in this case, pée- ‘bean’ + àk-‘soybean’; the “expected” form *pe(e)àk is rejected by speakers). Interestingly, theparallel process does not apply to back rounded vowels; poà ‘rice beer storage basket’
78
  To the extent that not all speakers agree on this point, it seems to hinge not on inter-speaker or inter-
dialectal differences, but rather on differences in levels of awarenesses of the difference in context-free
usage. Unfortunately, the number of homorganic long vowel sequences arising from morpheme
concatenation in my corpus is so small as to not permit a discourse-based analysis.

results from pòo- ‘liquor’ + á- ‘keep’, not *powà. 79 Glide-insertion is also found in themorphophonological process of Triggered foot-strengthening. In this case, a vowel-initial
enclitic motivates geminate glide-formation at the boundary of a ViVj word, with the glide
quality a function of the Vj vowel. Thus time, back rounded vowels are affected, as
hoə́=əə → [how.wə]; for further discussion and examples, see §4.1.4.6.
           So far, we have covered cases in which an initial form ending in a long vowel is
followed by a dependent vowel-initial form. Word-internally, an initial form ending in a
short vowel, if followed by a vowel-initial form, behaves in the same manner; the result is
a disyllabic [V.V] sequence. However, when a host phonological word ends in a
permitted short vowel (i, ə, o and, rarely, u), a following, dependent vowel-intial form isresyllabified as a prosodic constituent of the host. This process is also discussed in
§4.1.4.6.
           The Very long vowel constraint is relatively easily dealt with in synchronic
analysis, since its effects can always be “undone” by removing the conditions of the
alternation (e.g., a particle may be inserted between hoə́ and əə in the above example). Indiachronic analysis however, it can prove troublesome. This is because when a given
vowel-final root only has exemplars in a vowel-adjacent context, it becomes difficult or
impossible to determine its underlying (or historical) length. The case of poà ‘rice beerstorage basket’, discussed above, is easily dealt with inasmuch as numerous other
attestations of both roots exist (such as in opòo ‘liquor’ and anám ‘to keep’. In the case ofaì ‘heavy’ however (in which the initial reflects a short prefix a-), is the rhyme, reflecting
the ‘heavy’ root and the only attested lexeme in which this root appears, underlyingly
long ìi- or short ì-? This is a potentially vexing question which is not always easilyresolved. For discussion of one possible solution (albeit with limited applicability), see

will be called Type A, Type B and Type C. A Type A predicate stem consists of a single,
morphologically simplex, bound verb root, such as dó- ‘eat’ or ín- ‘go’. A Type Bpredicate stem is complex, and consists of a bound verb root plus a stem-expanding
derivation, as in dó-lɨ ̀ɨ ‘eat-DESD’ ‘want to eat’ and dó-kèn ‘eat-GOOD/EASY’ ‘delicious’. AType C predicate stem consists of a simplex or complex adjective, such as zèe‘green/blue’, hɨkɨ ́r ‘cool/cold’ (both simplex) or cɨ ́r-tə̀ ‘CLF:GRAIN-big’ ‘big-grained’(complex) (Table 10.2).

       ‘When he comes down, make (him) some tea (lit., ‘On his coming down, make
       some tea).’ (ZR, OLC2:10)       The question might be raised of whether genitive marking in Galo
nominalized/subordinated clauses is analyzable as dependent clause ergative marking (on
the one hand) or as passive/oblique subject marking (on the other). Although both of these
possible analyses are worth taking seriously, I reject both of them in the context of
modern Lare Galo, for the following reasons:
       Regarding the ergativity analysis, we should first be reminded that ergativity
refers to the fully grammaticalized alignment of S/O as opposed to A in all applicable
conditions (i.e., all possible configurations within a particular subdomain of the grammar
– say, of a particular subordinate clause type – or possibly in the grammar taken as a
whole). However, dependent clause genitive marking is in fact a subject (S/A) function in
Galo. It is sometimes not easy to see this, since some argument types may not be
representable in some conditions; for example, subject nominalizations contain an
obligatory, nominalized predicate-coreferential gap, meaning that genitive marking of
subjects is usually only witnessed in the context of object nominalizations (in which A is
marked in the genitive, in opposition to O). However, oblique nominalizations, in which S
may be represented, make the case for genitive marking as a subject property plain:
compare (965), in which a transitive object nominalization exhibits genitive subject
         49H
marking, with (967), in which an intransitive locative nominalization also exhibits subject
               450H
genitive marking.

       ‘There’s a place (there) where barking deer live.’ (IR, B8:42)       Regarding the passive/oblique subject analysis, although it might be argued that
object relatives such as in (965) background the actor, they only do so inasmuch as the
                           451H
entire event is backgrounded through expression as a relative clause. There is no
                                            740
construction in Galo which permits the notional actor of a simple main clause to be
expressed as oblique, hence, I argue, no true syntactic passive in Galo (see also §14.1.3.7).
                                                                                     452H
       Then, if all this is true, why are many types of Galo dependent clause subjects
marked in the genitive? It seems to me that this occurs for one ultimate reason and one
only: because the subject is opposed in these functions to a nominalized predicate
(whether currently or at some earlier stage of the language), and genitive marking is the
normal way of establishing a subordinate relation between one nominal and another in
Galo. Genitive subject-marking may subsequently be assigned the functional value of
disambiguating the lower clause subject from the higher clause subject; or, on the other
hand, it may simply be retained as an inherited feature of the construction, with no direct
functional value at all. Although a full investigation exceeds the scope of this work, I
would suggest that much might be learned from a future study which addresses this
question.","[738, 739, 740, 741]"
"        At the same time, predicate derivations are sometimes discovered in situations in
which it seems extremely difficult to discount the possibility that they are being directly,
and actively, derived from verb roots. For example, when I asked one of my consultants
to explain to me the meaning of the verb root cə̀p- ‘pinch’, I was shown a piece of paperbeing stuffed between the wall and its crossbeam, an activity which my consultant then
described as hɨ ̀ɨ-cə̀p-nam ‘press-PINCHED-NZR:RLS’ ‘to press something (between twosurfaces), pinching it’. This would seem to be a clear indication that my consultant saw
the forms cə̀p- ‘pinch’ (the form I had asked for) and -cə̀p ‘PINCHED RESULT’ (the formwhich he actually returned) as, in effect, semantically interchangeable (although,
potentially, pragmatically different). Furthermore, it seems to me here that the order of
derivation would be most straightforwardly analysed as verb root → predicate derivation
rather than the reverse; could this not be describable as an active synchronic derivational
process?
        It seems to me that it could. However, observations such as these raise an
interesting theoretical and methodological question: how is it possible for the analyst of
Galo grammar to distinguish, phenomenologically, between 1) observing a case of
expansion of the class of predicate derivations and 2) discovery of a predicate derivation
which had been previously unattested? Unless the boundaries of the class of predicate
derivations were initially well-defined, it is not easy to see what “expansion” would
necessarily mean. 21221F
11.1.7.4. Interim conclusion
        Returning to the question posed at the outset of this section, are Galo predicate
derivations roots, suffixes, or (in some sense) both? Evidence reviewed to date suggest
that in some sense, they are both. That is to say, certain predicate derivations – such
as -cə̀p ‘PINCHED RESULT’ – so closely resemble a probably cognate verb root that it212
   One promising test might involve loanwords or nonce forms. That is, one might stipulate a form *lòo-,
with the nonce semantic value * ‘of a pitcher, to break’ and test its ability to pattern as a novel Result
derivation, e.g. My efforts in this area to date have failed, with consultants invariably returning the Result
derivations (or other types of predicate derivation) which they would actually use in this function. Whether
a more imaginative experimenter than myself might design a better test than I have and return more
promising results, I shall leave to be seen. As for loans, I have found no indications to date that they may
ever be used as predicate derivations.
                                                     484
would appear that the predicate derivation should by similarly analysed as a type of root –
potentially, as the same root in two different functions. At the same time, other predicate
derivations – such as -hí ‘REFL’ – apparently reconstruct to Proto-Tani as predicatederivations in the same function (in this case PTs *ɕu ‘Reflexive’), are highly abstract anddo not seem to relate to a lexical root; such forms seem quite straightforwardly
describable as suffixes. These two types seem to represent two fairly comfortable
analytical extremes. However, there are also numerous examples of virtually every
imaginable type in between; a paradigm example would be -kák ‘CLEAN RESULT’ (cf.","[484, 485]"

15. Nominalization and nominalization-based constructions15.1.   Theoretical preliminary to nominalization in Galo
        As is by now well-known, it is common in Sino-Tibetan languages to find
extensive grammatical exploitation of structures which are synchronically analysable as
nominalizations, derive historically from nominalizations, or else derive from a third,
diachronically prior structure which also developed separately into a nominalization
(Matisoff 1972; Genetti 1992; Noonan 1997; Bickel 1999; DeLancey 2002; Yap and
Matthews in press).
        The most commonly-identified type of structure is what I will here call a
nominalized clause. A nominalized clause is here defined as a marked derivation of a
predicate and/or clause, such that the resulting structure is able to stand as head of an
argument noun phrase within a second, higher clause. Usually in Sino-Tibetan languages,
nominalized clauses may also stand as clausal adnominal modifiers, i.e. relative clauses
and nominal complements. Often, we also find what are here described as clausal
nominalizations (a.k.a. “standalone” nominalizations). Clausal nominalizations generally
resemble main clauses – they are not subordinated to any higher syntactic constituent –
and yet they exhibit nominalizing morphology (or morphology which also has
nominalizing functions), or otherwise in some way resemble a nominalization. Finally,
and seemingly more rarely, non-clausal adnominal modifiers such as genitive phrases are
often viewed as participating in the same overall syncretism, usually because they are
marked by morphology which also performs nominalizations and/or relativizations
(Matisoff 1972; Noonan 1997). As far as I can see, all of these structural types potentially
fall within the descriptive scope of Bickel’s (1999) term “Standard Sino-Tibetan
Nominalization (SSTN)”, which has gained wide if not universal acceptance. In Galo, we
find extensive exploitation of all of these grammatical structures, with the exception that
Genitive marking and/or non-clausal nominal subordination do not generally seem to
relate synchronically to Galo nominalization processes. The Galo genitive marker gə/-kə̀is not relatable to any attested Tani nominalizers, does not itself mark predicates which
are not independently nominalized.
        An exhaustive review of the theoretical questions which arise in the course of
determining the synchronic grammatical status of nominalization-derived structures falls
outside the scope of this work (more detailed discussion will be found in Post (in                                             752
preparation-b)). However, for the purpose of grounding the presentation to follow, a few
key points should be established.
       The first is that I take in this work a conservative and literal view of the concept of
“nominalization”. In this view, the term “nominalization” strictly denotes all and only
those members of a set of grammatical operations in which a term which may be treated
as a nominal by the grammar of a language is derived from a term which cannot be so
treated. Although there may be some semantic or even pragmatic values that also adhere
to a given type of nominalization (such as “reification” or “backgrounding”), these values
are neither necessary nor sufficient criteria to the designation of any particular structure as
a nominalization.
       The second point has to do with synchronic versus diachronic dimensions of
analysis. As many previous works have already noted, the fact that a given structure
resembles a nominalization morphologically does not necessarily indicate that it has the
synchronic grammatical status of a nominal (see e.g. Genetti (1992)). That is, although a
particular structure may employ morphology which is elsewhere employed in the function
of nominalization, if it cannot be directly employed in a prototypical nominal function
(particularly, as head of an argument noun phrase), it is not a clear candidate for analysis
as a synchronic nominal, whatever its internal form and historical origin. In addition,
when a nominalizer resembles a form with some other type of functionality – say, a noun-
subordinator – this does not necessarily indicate either that they represent a single
synchronic form-class (polyfunctional or not) or that any one function has evolved
directly from any other. It is equally possible that some earlier form gave rise separately
both to nominalizing functionality and to some other type of functionality. Certainly,
structural and functional resemblances will exist in such cases, but resemblances do not
count as evidence either of an active synchronic relationship or of a direct historical
relationship (i.e., of the form *A → B).
       In sum, I count a structure as a synchronic nominalization if and only if it licenses
treatment of a non-nominal as a nominal by the grammar. This is not to say that the task
of identification is necessarily easy or straightforward, but it is set as an overall goal. As
to the diachronic dimension, it is not assumed that any one type of structure necessarily or
even naturally evolves from or is diachronically relatable to any other type of structure;
rather, the question of precedence (i.e. of a nominalizing or some other type of
structure/function) is left open to demonstration via comparative analysis and
morphosyntactic reconstruction.","[749, 750, 751, 752, 753]"

2.1. Morphological profile of Proto-Tani
         Proto-Tani shows signs of having been, or having had a near ancestor which was,
a basically “morphosyllabic” 25 language of the type found commonly in Mainland South-24
   Note also that no serious claims are advanced here concerning time-depth, either of Proto-Tani or of any
stage since then. I am not aware of the existence of any uniformly reliable method for determining linguistic
time-depth in absence of written records, which in this case are unavailable.
25
   The useful term “morphosyllabic” was coined by Timothy Light (1978) in the context of tonogenesis
theory, and was also used by Sun (1993b) with specific reference to Proto-Tani. Broadly speaking, a
prototypical morphosyllabic language is strongly isolating and analytical, with a basic unity
syllable=morpheme=word predominating. Very little well-grammaticalized material is found, with most
grammatical functions coded by lexemes in particular constructions (such as serial verb constructions).
Typically, morphosyllabic languages also exhibit relatively simple segmental phonology as well as lexical
tones. Not all scholars have adopted this useful label; however the basic characteristics of the typology in
question are generally agreed-upon.

subsections review the main evidence for this view.","[82, 83]"
"4.2.4. Integration of surface prosody
        Integration of surface prosody remains one of the greatest standing challenges in
Galo language description. The view sketched above is one in which the basic prosodic
constituent is the phonological word, and where prosodic rules apply at both word and
phrase levels. The question is whether all prosodic phenomena are sensitive to and/or
identify precisely the same types of constituent. We have already seen some evidence that
this may not be the case; for example, the shape of a tonal contour may or may not be
sensitive to the same basic word-and-syllable-level structural features to which rhythm
appears to be sensitive. Furthermore, we have seen evidence from tonal contours that
certain grammatical non-head elements (such as a predicate-adjacent nominal, including a
subject pronoun) behave as though they formed an element of a phonological phrase with
a following head. However, it is not at all clear what their metrical status with respect to
the overall phrase would be.
        Ultimately, it would seem as though in the process of shifting from a basically
morphosyllabic language (cf. §2.1) to a basically synthetic, agglutinating language,
prosody has played a central, and possibly a motivating role. Furthermore, it may be that
the process remains ongoing. Just as stress and rhythm may have motivated historical
sound changes at the word level (for example, Word-final weakening; see §2.4.4.5), the
same basic patterns may now be motivating shifts in constituency at a higher level (for
example, the collapse of the Topic-marker əə into some types of lexeme, as exemplifiedin §4.1.4.6).
        Finally, a topic on which this grammar is almost completely silent is that of
pragmatically-oriented sentence/phrasal intonation (for a brief overview of linking
intonation, see §16.2.2). Although it is clear that pragmatically-oriented intonation exists
in Galo, and interacts with the mainly lexically- and rhythmically-driven prosody
described in this chapter, the process of discovering regularities to this interaction has but
barely begun. Under the circumstances, and given the complexities involved, it is certain
that Galo prosodic phonology will remain an intriguing and rewarding topic for
continuing research from a variety of perspectives; I sincerely hope that this very basic
description will provide some suggestive avenues for further inquiry.",[202]

7.4.1.1. Proximate dimension 1: speaker vs. addressee-orientation
                     In the most basic, spatial-deictic sense, Speaker-proximate and Addressee-
proximate demonstratives refer to entities or locations which are construed as being
nearer to or in the possession of the speaker or addressee respectively. In the following
exchange, the three demonstratives in bold refer to the same object, which is located
relatively close to speaker IRw. Speaker IR refers to this object using Addressee-
proximate demonstratives, while speaker IRw uses Speaker-proximate demonstratives
(214)-(215).

                     A second and probably derivative use of non-locative Proximate demonstratives 158 157F
is in marking discourse endophora (anaphora and cataphora) and topicality. In some cases,
the Speaker/Addressee-orientation discussed in §7.4.1.1 extends to this use; for example,
                                                                            2674H
       an Addressee-proximate form is invariably used to refer to the contents of an
       interlocutor’s speech, while a Speaker-proximate form would be used to refer to the
       contents of the speaker’s speech. However, such cases can probably be subsumed under
       the following, more general, set of distinctions (disregarding diachronic prioricity).
                     Generally speaking, anaphora are coded using Addressee-proximate
demonstrative forms. In the exchange in (216)-(217), speaker IR uses the Addressee-

Table 2.26 – Illustration of Intervocalic glide deletion
        A notable outcome of this change was its effect on the grammatical differentiation
of some Galo dialects. In particular, disyllabic forms which resulted from morphological
fusion of a particle or enclitic to the PG Irrealis suffix *-rjə́ ‘IRR’ (with Lare and Pugoreflexes -rə́ ‘IRR’ and -jé ‘IRR’ respectively) or to the PG Polar question particle *rjee ‘PQ’(with Lare and Pugo reflexes ree ‘PQ’ and jee ‘PQ’) were subjected to a collapse intomonosyllables in Pugo, but not in Lare. This was because rj-split (§2.4.4.2) in Pugocreated numerous environments which qualified for Intervocalic glide deletion which
were not created in Lare. Among the affected forms identified to date are the Additive
concessive suffix (Lare -gərə́ ‘ACNC’, Pugo -gée ‘ACNC’) (§16.4.4.3), Conjectural particle(§13.3.3.4) (Lare bəree ‘CJEC’, Pugo bee ‘CJEC’) and Dubitative particle (§13.3.3.2) (Larelaree ‘DUB’, Pugo lee ‘DUB’). Although the grammatical categories which these forms

now exist sometimes create difficulties in cross-dialectal comprehension.",[117]
"Thus, evidence is sufficient to establish -K as a phoneme, but with limited distributionand with incomplete phonetic specification.
         Intriguingly, some speakers report sensing a “difference” of some kind between
alveolar nasals which result from assimilation of a form in -K to a following alveolarnasal, and an alveolar nasal which realizes underlying -n. Thus, for example, in zinnám‘to melt’ (< zíK-nam ‘melt-NZR:RLS), the first medial [n] seemed to occur as a dental [n̺],while in zinnàm ‘to stretch (VI)’ (< zìn-nam ‘stretch-NZR:RLS’) the corresponding segmentwas alveolar. This difference was not found among other alveolar segments (i.e., a [d]resulting from assimilation occurred as [d], not [d̺]). However, some queried speakersreported sensing no difference, nor could I discern any in their speech. Thus, it is both
possible that the “difference” was an illusion, 67 and that, at least in some Lare subdialects,
partial retention of an archaic pronunciation exists. This question would require further
study.",[144]
"Also consider the pair kartə̀ ‘huge wedding’ and karmɨ ̀k ‘ordinary wedding.’ The firstterm derives from PG *kár- ‘luminescence’ (cf. takár ‘star’) and the PG root *tə̀- ‘big’discussed above, while the final element of the second word is mɨ ̀k- ‘powder’ (< PTs*mɨk ‘powder’). *karɲí (reflecting PG *ɲí- ‘small’) and *karjáa (< PTs *jaŋ ‘small’) arerejected, although they use roots which are more often antonymically opposed to tə̀- ‘big’in the modern Lare lexicon. 32 If words always represented actively-formed root-root
constructions, such idiosyncrasies would be difficult to explain, and one would assume
31
   ‘Haunch’ is used here in the sense of the Galo root – which is more general than the corresponding
English word – to mean ‘upper portion of either limb, from mid-joint (elbow, knee), through the upper joint
muscle (shoulder, buttock), to joint (shoulder joint, hip joint).’

that formations such as *karɲí would at least be intelligible to listeners. Instead, it appearsthat the words reviewed here have been fully lexicalized and are not in fact based on
active formations.
         Finally, consider word class-membership. Although the Lare root dɨ ́k- (above, thissection) participates in all available classes, it provides the exception rather than the rule.
aró ‘tongue’ has the verb root counterpart ró- ‘extend tongue’, but aɲɨ ́k ‘eye’ has no verbroot counterpart *ɲɨ ́k-. Why should this be? There may be a synchronic explanation, butthe answer probably lies in the idiosyncrasies of historical processes of lexicalization.","[92, 93]"

1.2.7. Linguistic affiliations, dialects and subdialects
        As definitively shown for the first time by the eminent Taiwanese scholar Tian-
Shin Jackson Sun (1993b), Galo falls within the Tani subgroup of Tibeto-Burman.
However, both the position of Tani within Tibeto-Burman and the position of Galo within
Tani remain to be fully worked-out. While I cannot address the first question in the
present work, I will attempt to address the second.
        As noted earlier, this is the first comprehensive grammar not only of Galo, but of
any of the Tani languages; accordingly, we lack adequate grammatical descriptions such
as would enable us to subgroup languages and dialects on the basis of the shared
morphological innovations which have been noted e.g. by Dixon (1997) to be the most
effective criteria for subgrouping when available. However, on the basis of segmental
phonological correspondences, and by comparison with the Proto-Tani (PT)
reconstructions by Sun , we can establish a Proto-Galo (PG) segment inventory which
places it in the position in Sun’s (1993b) tree shown in Figure 1.7. We can very
provisionally further group those Galo dialects I have studied to date as in Figure 1.8.","[45, 46]"

16.3.1. Coordination by free syntactic operators
16.3.1.1. Conjunctive/additive coordination
           The most frequently-used conjunctive/additive (‘x and (also) y’) coordinator is
okkə́ə (phonetically realized [okkə́ə ~ okə́ ~ ók ~ ʔkə́]). okkə́ə appears to derivehistorically from, and could potentially be argued to remain relatable to, a collocation okə̀‘ANAP.ABL’ + əə ‘TOP’ (with the overall sense ‘from that previously mentioned thing, nowthis:’) (§7.4.6.3).
             4650H
           Typically, okkə́ə conjoins two final clauses, in which the second, focal clause isconstrued as thematically and temporally subsequent to the first, supporting clause. 300            29F
okkə́ə is best analysed as a structural element of the clause it introduces (1056).    4651H
300
      The semantic terms “focal clause” and “supporting clause” are discussed in Dixon (under review).

        Although in examples like (1056) okkə́ə may be said to establish a clear
                                      4652H
relationship of thematic and temporal continuity between two clauses and the events they
code, in other cases okkə́ə functions more loosely as a simple indicator that the speakerhas something more to say and is about to say it. There are no discernible grammatical
constraints in terms of argument structure or TAM-sharing which obligatorily hold
between clauses coordinated in okkə́ə. In (1057), note that none of the three clauses

16.3.1.2. Disjunctive/alternative coordination
               Closed disjunctive coordination among Galo interrogative clauses (‘x or y?’) may
be obtained through apposition of structurally parallel clauses with contrasting semantic
values (§16.2.1). This construction may be additionally supported through marking in
                4658H
máa. In the main a Negative polarity particle, and basically homophonous with theNegative polarity predicate suffix -máa (§12.2) and the Negative interjection máa ~ máʔ

‘no’ (§13.7.3), in disjunctive function máa marks a polar (closed) alternation between
        460H
two coordinated interrogative clauses. The marked clauses may themselves contrast in
polarity, or they may not. When two clauses are coordinated as in (1060), disjunctive máa
                                                                                       461H
tends to pattern prosodically with the supporting clause, although it is important to note                                                            789

3.3.1. Diphthongs
        The occurrence or non-occurrence of diphthongs in Galo is a vexing question.
Diphthongs do not seem to have occurred at the Proto-Tani stage, and are thus not
generally found in the underlying representations of monosyllabic Galo roots and other
morphemes. However, as a result of historical processes of compounding and prefixation,
as well as sound changes, 61 a few heterorganic ViVj sequences have emerged which may
or may not have the same prosodic status as long vowels (i.e., as ViVi sequences) in
61
  Compounding and root-prefixation in themselves created opportunities for short vowel adjacency; these
opportunities were also enhanced by the pre-Proto-Galo loss of most initial fricatives, which left many
previously “shielded” short vowel nuclei “exposed”. For example, consider aú ‘fat/grease’ < PTs *a-fu
‘PFX-fat/grease’.

       As in many Tibeto-Burman languages, as well as elsewhere, it is common in Galo
to find nominals unmarked for case (and typically free of any other modifiers) occurring
immediately adjacent to a predicate and often forming a tight, word-like phonological
and conceptual bond with it. The grammatical status of such forms is not always
straightforwardly determined.
       In some cases, it seems clear that the nominal in question is an argument of the
predicate – often, an O argument – which is not case-marked because it is generic and/or
non-referential (§14.2.1.1). In (913), rák- is a transitive verb meaning roughly ‘weave or
                       438H     439H

        In many functions, postpositions have both demonstrative postpositional and
pronominal-suffixal allomorphs. However, although they may be identical in their
grammatical and/or semantic relational marking functions, these three morpheme classes
are structurally/categorically distinct: true postpositions occur post-nominally only; this
distinguishes them from demonstrative postpositions on the one hand – which may
“bracket” a noun phrase – and suffixal allomorphs of relational markers on the other hand
– which may depend on both iterations of a “bracketing” demonstrative (§6.1.2.2.4). The

simplex postpositions (or postpositions with another neighbouring form, such as a particle)

occurrences are limited to specific sequences of particular forms; furthermore, such
sequences are not always (or not always obviously) synchronically compositional.","[297, 298]"

        Quantity-sensitivity (or syllable structure/weight) complicates analysis of Galo
stress considerably. This is because certain potential phonetic correlates of stress appear
to be sensitive to the quantity of mora in a particular syllable, while others do not.
        Generally speaking, if a phonological word contains a sequence of identically-
weighted syllables, as aló [`a.lo] ‘salt’ and pumtúp [`pum.tup] ‘tip of the nose’, a trochaicfoot is formed, and the initial syllable is relatively longer in duration, has a relatively full
vocalic specification, and is relatively higher in amplitude. If the word in question is a
Low/Tense word, the phonetic location of the “pitch peak” will tend to occur over the
first syllable, not the second. This overall relative asymmetry is even more pronounced
and noticeable when the foot-initial syllable is heavier than the foot-final syllable. Figure
4.24 represents the waveform, pitch (lower line) and intensity (higher line) of ŋó tabə̀=gokáa-tó ‘1.SG sugar cane=IND look-PFV’ ‘I saw some sugar cane’, as spoken by a middle-aged male, realized [`ŋó `tâbə gò `kaató]. Note with respect to tabə̀ ‘sugar cane’ that thepitch and intensity peaks both occur over the syllable [ta]. The duration of the syllablenucleus in [ta], at 91 Ms, is also longer than that of [bə], at only 34 Ms. Moreover,although this is not discernible from the measures presented, the syllable nucleus in [ta] ismore fully realized as [a] than is that of [bə], which registers as little more than a releaseof the preceding stop. All of the identified criteria thus converge to identify [ta] as“stressed” relative to [bə].",[198]
