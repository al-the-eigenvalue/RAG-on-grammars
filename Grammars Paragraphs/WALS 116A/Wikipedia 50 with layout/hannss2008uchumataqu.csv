    There are exceptions from this rule, which make up 5,26% of all information questions I consider them
to be misinterpretations and thus, will not treat them as regular instances of Uchumataqu interrogative
clauses.

    The form of the interrogative pronoun hekis 'who1'' differs from the usual form hek. The difference
cannot be explained.
280                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA

           who-COM you you-TOP species_of_fish hunt-SR go-FU
           'Whom will you (sg) go hunting cisi fish with?' (Uhle 1894:94.1 )7.6.2 Yes /no questions
This type of interrogative clauses has no particular morphological features except for
the question bound topic marker -xwi.
(49)       uxk ni-stani     paku-xwi
           go (s)he-cOM dog-QTP
           'Did the dog go with him / her?'
           ('tEl hapartido con esteperro?'')                            (Vellard 1967:24)
A striking feature of yes / no questions is the use of declarative -cay. In general, there
is a slight tendency for the interrogative clauses to occur without this marker (50) but
it occurs regularly in non-verbal predicate clauses of any type (51).
(50)       ikan-si kumi pek         okwa-kalfaj pek
           rest-AN you     want go-CERT           want
           'Do you (sg) want a rest [or] do you want to go?' (Vellard 1949:169)
(51)       qotfaj-ksi sex ana-kfij sex-cay
           lake-LOC be NEO-TOP be-DEC
           'Are there (some) in the lake or are there not?'             (Uhle 1894:68.2)
However, declarative -cay is also used in clauses containg a full verbal predicate
although in such cases, the tendency is to occur without it.
(52)       ana tulun kun-tani okwfaj-aki-cay
            NEG grief      you-COM gO-FU-DEC
            'Won't you (sg) go with grief?' (lit.: 'Won't the grief go with you?')
                                                               (Vellard 1949:169)637
It is possible that the application of declarative -cay marks an increased certainty on
the speaker's side with respect to the answer. Thus, when the speaker believes to
know the answer, (s)he uses declarative -cay, whereas in a case when the answer
cannot be anticipated by the speaker declarative -cay is missing. If this proposition is
true, then example (50) would display a lack of certainty, i.e. it is unknown to the
speaker what his / her interlocutor may want. In example (52), however, a particular
answer may even be expected (namely, that Vellard would not leave easily) and thus,
the speaker feels able to use declarative -cay in his question.
      In some cases, declarative -cay and question bound topic marker -ki are
combined, which I regard as errors since these markers are generally mutually
exclusive (cf. 7.2). The answer to a yes / no question is the repetition of the verb, as
demonstrated in example (53a) and (b).","[296, 297]"

In yes / no questions without question bound topic marker -xwi, there is a strong
tendency to have the word order of OSV (50 and 54). When this marker is applied,
the marked word order may become unnecessary and other combinations are then
possible, too.

For yes / no questions that neither display a marked word order nor carry the marker -
xwi, we may assume that context contributes to their interpretation as interrogative.","[297, 298]"

The following section deals with items that do not belong to the word classes
presented above, and no feature can be established that classifies them as a category
of their own. With one exception, to be discussed below none of these lexical items
takes particular morphological marking except for personal and clausal clitics.
Furthermore, negation ana 'no, not' is the only expression that occurs in all
documents while the remaining particles appear in only one source. Therefore, they
cannot be cross-checked and verified and thus, it remains uncertain whether the items

Table 3 5 Uchumataqu particles (spelling not adjusted)
The first case to be discussed is hi-lay 'yes' (112a and b)
(112) a          ti-s         pitcfaj-aki-cay nayas-[a]ki-cay
                 this-CL=3 come-FU-DEC choke-FU-DEC
                 'This [fish] will come, you will choke [it] '
           b     hi-lay
                 'Yes'                                                (Vellard 1949 159)
In contrast to modem Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino 2006 109), which uses hee-za to
express positive confirmation, the sources on Uchumataqu (including Vellard) agree
on that the notion 'yes' is expressed by repetition of the verb form (cf 113a and b)
(113) a          kun tam
                 you take
                 'Did you (sg) catch [itp'
           b     tan-u-cay
                 take-PSTl-DEC
                 '[Yes,] I caught it '                                (Vellard 1949 158)
Although the Uchumataqu form hi-lay shows considerable similanty to its Chipaya
equivalent, it remains largely uncertain whether hi-lay is a regular form, under which
314
      Uchumataqu forms alphabetically ordered Slashes denote alternative forms
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                    161
circumstances it could be used, and what the difference is between hi-lay and
repetition of the verb form.
      Next is isu-cay 'so, that' (Vellard 1949:151), which is probably a loan from
Spanish eso 'this, that' (cf. 2.11) and thus, we do not know whether the form ka:ya-
ca: (Uhle 1894:2) represents the original Uchumataqu expression. Furthermore, Uhle
did not specify whether this item is from Chipaya or Uchumataqu.
      Likewise uncertain is the use of sipi 'when, if, as given by Polo (1901:476).
Notions of mood and modality are usually expressed by irrealis -aca (cf. 5.8.2) and
thus, the use of a presumably unbound morpheme such as sipi appears to be striking.
It is possible that the first part is a loan from Spanish si meaning 'when, if335 but in
this case, the second element *-pi remains unanalysable. I would like to point to
Cuzco Quechua where a similar phenomenon can be observed. In this dialect,
Spanish si in its meaning 'when, if is combined with -chus which itself consists of
negation and question marking -chu and Reportative -s(i) (Cusihuamân 1976:248).
The resulting form sichus is likewise translated as 'when, if (cf. Valderrama and
Escalante 1977, Hannß 2004). However, since sipi is a single instance and its second
component remains elusive nothing further can be said about it.
      Another element to be discussed is somewhat exceptional to the previous ones
since wajasiki23*' 'that's why' comprises a form -siki which can be analysed as the
locative marker (cf. 4.1.1.3). The element *waja- does not occur elsewhere and we
may assume that wajasiki is lexicalised, provided it is a regular form of Uchumataqu
at all.
      Finally, Uhle (1894:113, 54.1) presents two particles related to Aymara. The
expression winaya 'always' is a direct loan from Aymara337 (DeLucca 1983:853)
while waligara, which is translated by Uhle as 'like'338, comprises the form wali
meaning 'well' or 'much' (DeLucca 1983:444). The form wali itself is used as an
adverb in Uchumataqu (cf. 6.1.4) but the element *-gara cannot be established for
neither Aymara nor Uchumataqu. The notion of comparative 'like' is expressed in
Aymara by the bound grammatical morpheme -jama (DeLucca 1983:606), whereas
Uchumataqu uses separative -kistana. Therefore, the form waligara remains largely
unanalysable. The remaining forms do not show any peculiarities or relations to other
bound or free morphemes.
      In what follows, I do not interpret the term 'phrase' in its syntactic sense but
rather in a pragmatic way, i.e. as a fixed expression that serves in daily
communication. As such, these phrases form a closed set. They are not a part of
speech as are e.g. adjectives but neither do they belong to a particular clause type (cf.
chapter 7) for they are fixed and do not allow much morphological or syntactic
variation. Therefore, these expressions are treated as a final remark on the parts of
speech Uchumataqu comprises.
      The majority of these phrases comes from Vellard (1949, 1951) and is thus
subject to the same source-related restrictions as are particles. Some of the phrases  It can also mean 'yes'
  As a quotation, the form waja- is maintained and not adopted to the Irohito alphabet
  Uhle points to this.
  Likewise for not specified for its origin Uhle himself is doubtful about the meaning of waligara.
162                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
cannot be analysed and most may be regarded as lexicalised. Furthermore, we lack a
context to these phrases and therefore, it remains largely unclear how they were used.
Taking this into consideration the following will be restricted to a mere presentation
of phrases and discussion will concern only some general features and observations.

Some of these phrases are clearly analysable, e.g. ok^acay 'I will go' and in response
cunukasiì4ì 'alright' (Vellard 1951:20). Others can be understood only in part. This is
the case with e.g. cuni luxkucay wat cay 'thank you (for the meal)' (Vellard 1951:20)
where cuni luxkucay means 'I ate well' but the expression wat'cay remains elusive
(cf. Muysken 2005). The same is true for 'good evening' which is expressed as
sequese sincilita (Polo 1901:479). The first element sequese is reminiscent of the
word for 'evening' sericai or seheri (Polo 1901:476) but the form sincilita remains
uncertain342. Other forms that cannot be explained are kuntinsw, kal tinskucay, kam-
tun, and wa.ntuncay. It is possible that tun- of kam-tun and wa.ntuncay is related to
the verb stem tuna- or tona- meaning 'to come'. Provided these expressions are
indeed part of the Uchumataqu register of phrases, well-wishes, and greetings, it is
likely that they are lexicalised.
     The element -ay or -lay344 occurs on the respectful address for a superior person
appay or apây 'father', on epalai145 'good day', on cicalay used to greet a brother or
a person of equal rank. It may have inspired the interjection hay 'oh', as in hay
happay 'oh, father' (Vellard 1951:19) in response to happay. If the element -ay or
-lay has ever been a suffix of Uchumataqu it was not productive any more at the time
of documentation and it does not occur elsewhere. Although its exact meaning
therefore has to remain uncertain it seems justified to propose that it conveys the idea
of a respectful and polite address when attached to kinship terms. These terms, then,
may be considered to be an appropriate way of expressing politeness and respect
when dealing with a person one is not related to.
      Finally, the greeting exchanged between husband and wife should be mentioned.
The husband greets his wife with tun'una atto (Vellard 1951:20) which itself is not
translated by Vellard. The first element tun 'una shows considerable similarity with
the verb ton- 'to come' (Métraux 1935:109)346 while the second element atto is a
kinship term meaning 'mother'. In response the wife replies with wa.ntuncay apay
341
    The change of/i/ to /u/ on curnt- cannot be explained
342
    Métraux points to the similarity between the expression for 'good evening' and the word for 'evening'
sese.
343
    The element kun could be a form of second person singular. For further dicussion, cf. 4 2.5 1.1
344
    See also Polo (1901 481) who points out that male kinship terms end in -at
345
    Although Métraux translated this expression as 'good day' it is likely that it means the same as happay,
i e. 'father' in respectfully addressing a person of higher rank, epalai shows considerable similarity to the
kinship term ep '(biological) father'.
346
    Vellard does not mention the use of the verb ton- 'to come'
164                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
where wa.ntun- remains largely inexplicable except for the element -tun- which again
is reminiscent of'to come'. The term apay means 'father' as outlined above. That is,
the kinship terms of 'father' and 'mother' are used between husband and wife in
order to express politeness and respect347. This consideration gives further support to
the assumption that with respect to pragmatics kinship terms function as a polite
means to address people of equal or higher social rank. Thus, they have a scope
beyond the simple denotation of relationship.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]"

1 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE UCHUMATAQU LANGUAGE
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDYUchumataqu, also known as Uru, was spoken around Lake Titicaca in the
communities of Irohito (northwestern Bolivia), Ch'imu (southeastern Peru), and in
the Bay of Puno (Peru) It is assumed that in pre-colomal times there has been an
Uru-speaking population all along the nvers of the Bolivian Altipiano and at the great
lakes Titicaca, Ροορό and Coipasa Wachtel (1986 283) named this stretch the
""aquatic axis"" Adapting to this environment, the Uru based their economy on
hunting, fishing, and gathering However, it is likely that the Uru already became
dispersed under Inca rule and matters did not improve for the Uru population when
the Spanish arrived In fact, they were forced to leave their traditional communities,
abandon their lifestyle and settle down in Aymara villages By this process, the
community of Irohito became isolated and what could be called one of 'the last
stands' of Uru culture and language Despite less favourable social, economic, and
political circumstances, the small village of Irohito managed to survive and even
maintained its language Uchumataqu Although the Uru, their particular culture and
language had been known since early colonial times, they were not documented
before 1894, when Max Uhle paid a visit to Irohito and for the first time collected
linguistic data Irohito soon became a kind of scientific hot spot (Muysken m s
2007 4) and during the first half of the 20th century, the village was visited by a
number of researchers, who recorded Uchumataqu However, a severe drought at the
beginning of the 1940's brought the end to Irohito, and Uchumataqu became extinct
around 1950 However, Irohito recovered and survived as a settlement Today, there
is a certain pnde of the inhabitants about their distinct culture Although the language
has been extinct for about half a century by now and only the knowledge of some
words and phrases remains, the Uru are aware of their ancient language, which, still,
contnbutes to the Urns' view of themselves as being different from all their
neighbours
      This study is based on the efforts and results of the early researchers, who
worked in Irohito and on Uchumataqu between 1894 and 1967 Although a
considerable amount of research had been conducted during this time, only few
studies were actually published and none brought together what had been said on
Uchumataqu Therefore, the aim of this book is to provide a grammatical description
of Uchumataqu, taking into consideration every study, published or unpublished, that
is concerned with linguistic data on Uchumataqu It seeks to give an impression of
this language and its phonological, morphological, and syntactic processes and to
provide linguists from different backgrounds with a reference grammar on this so far
minimally described language Working with (in part) historic material on a language
that is not acquired by anyone any more as native language involves a certain degree
of reconstruction and makes necessary more assumptions and incertainties than
would have been the case with a language that is still spoken However, this study is
not a reconstruction in the sense that it tries to reconstruct a proto-language or the
kind of Uchumataqu that was spoken 500 years ago Rather, its purpose is to describe
the language as it has been recorded during the last 50 years of its existence and is
2                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
thus a description of a highly endangered language, which, became extinct two
generations ago. It cannot be denied that material from different researchers with
different backgrounds and recorded at different stages of the language, adds new
problems to the already existing challenge of describing a dying language. Thus, in
some cases our knowledge of certain phenomena remains limited since the data do
not provide solutions and there are no native speakers left to answer questions.
      To give a more detailed outline of Uchumataqu, its speakers and the research on
which the present study is based, this chapter will sketch the structure of Uchumataqu
and its differences and similarities with closely related Chipaya, before giving an
overview of the Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara influences on this language. That
will be followed by a description of the history of Irohito, its development during the
20th century, and its position at the beginning of the 21 st century, including a sketch
on the field-work I conducted in Irohito. Before turning to detailed presentation of
the sources considered here, I will comment on the theoretical framework applied for
the current study and the resulting terminology and methodology.
      This introductory chapter will be followed by a description of the phonology of
Uchumataqu and its morphophonological processes in chapter 2, which I call
context-sensitive processes. Chapter 3 describes the morphological patterns that can
be observed in Uchumataqu. Then I turn to a description of the nominal system in
chapter 4. Chapter 5 concerns a presentation of the verbal system of Uchumataqu.
The following chapter 6 deals with adverbs, postpositions, and the negation particle
ana. The final chapter of this book provides a description of the clause types and
syntactic operations of Uchumataqu. The appendices contain a comparative
dictionary and transcriptions of Uhle's and Lehmann's manuscripts of Uchumataqu.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"1.1 Structural overview of the Uchumataqu language
Together with closely related Chipaya (cf. 1.1.2), Uchumataqu forms the language
family of Uru-Chipaya, which is assumed to be isolated (cf. Torero 2002:466,
Muysken 2001:76). The following summary of the linguistic structure of
Uchumataqu is based on my research and the features addressed here will be further
outlined in chapters 2 to 7.
       Uchumataqu phonology differs in some aspects from that of the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Just like these languages Uchumataqu has a rather
elaborate set of plosives. However, these include aspirated, glottalised, and labialised
plosives, and word initial plosive clusters, something that cannot be observed for
Quechua or Aymara. Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some affricates and fricatives,
which do not occur in its neighbouring languages, either, such as dental voiceless
affricate /ts/ or postalveolar voiceless fricative [J]1. Another distinctive feature of
Uchumataqu phonology is the 5-vowel system with a long variant of each vowel.
However, increasing influence of Aymara (with a 3-vowel system) caused the
attrition of the 5-vowel system, as can be observed in later studies on Uchumataqu
(e.g. Vellard 1967). The tendency of Uchumataqu to allow consonant clusters is also
reflected in its syllable structure, where a syllable can have the form of CVCC or
    Which does not have phonemic status.
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                              3
CCVC. However, the most common forms are CV or CVC. With respect to stress we
find that Uchumataqu has a tendency to place stress on the penultimate syllable,
although this is not compulsory and there are exceptions from this, particularly when
a bisyllabic stem is inflected with a bisyllabic suffix or a mono- or bisyllabic verb is
inflected with first person singular markers -u or -a.
      The elision of final vowels (or in some cases the deletion of the last syllable)
does not have morphological meaning in Uchumataqu, i.e. kuy' 'house' does not
denote a direct object or any other grammatical relation, although the full form would
be kuya. I therefore call these processes context-sensitive instead of
morphophonological. The context-sensitive processes comprise mainly final vowel
elision and to a lesser degree elision of consonants. In order to prevent elision, the
dummy elements -i and -u are used. Uchumataqu has a certain tendency towards
metathesis, which occurs with the present tense habitual marker -in that is
metathesised to -ni, related state adjectival marker -tni to -tin, and the locative
markers -kis and -fa/' and their allophones -ski and -siki which are built by metathesis
      Uchumataqu distinguishes three major parts of speech, which are nouns,
adjectives and verbs. There is no morphological device that distinguishes particles as
a separate class and the only particle that occurs frequently is the negation particle
ana 'no, not'. Adverbs can be subsumed under either nouns or adjectives. The latter
are distinguished by the use of predicator -kasi and form an open class in
Uchumataqu. Morphological processes of Uchumataqu are primarily compounding,
only marginally noun incorporation and reduplication. Uchumataqu compounds
consist of a nominal head and a modifier, which can be another noun, an adjective, or
an adverb; the resulting compounds are endocentric or exocentric, although the latter
is exceptional. Compounding is a productive process in Uchumataqu and occurs
mainly with kinship terms and body parts. Noun incorporation, however, is hardly
ever used in Uchumataqu and the few examples found could be analysed differently.
Reduplication is another productive morphological process of Uchumataqu and
occurs with all parts of speech and can be partial or complete. With verbs,
reduplication mainly intensifies the meaning of the verb stem, while reduplicated
adjectives and nouns are augmentative or, in the case of nouns, express plurality.
Reduplication of grammatical material is mainly restricted to possessive marking -ci.
      Although Uchumataqu is an agglutinative language, the average number of
affixes per word is low: nouns and pronouns tend to carry only one affix, while
adjectives and adverbs are often zero marked or have at best one bound morpheme.
This also holds for particles and numerals. Only verbs have a tendency to carry two
morphological morphemes, and verbs with three or four affixes attached are
exceptional. Uchumataqu differs from Aymara and Quechua by the low number of
affixes that occur on a stem.
      Uchumataqu employs mainly suffixes, but it also has two prefixes, one of which
is lexicalised. The case marking system of Uchumataqu resembles that of Aymara
and Quechua with the exception of locative marking devices, where we find the
directional locative -kis (and its metathesised allomorph -ski), locative marker -ksi
(and the allomorph -siki) as well as yet another locative marker -ta. The latter
contrasts with locative -ksi I -siki since the form -ta does not occur with stative or
4                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
position verbs or in locational predicate clauses. Uchumataqu has six personal
pronouns, which also occur in possession marking and only for the first person
singular does a specially marked form exist: wist 'my'. However, it is likely that at
least the third person plural pronoun ninaka 'they' has been inspired by Aymara, with
which it shares plural marker -naka. This appears to be a recent development since
sources until Métraux (1935) still report the use of an ancient pronominal plural
marker -wici. Similar considerations could be applied to the pronoun of first person
plural exclusive wisnaka, which is clearly derived from first person singular wir 'Γ
and -naka, although no combination of wir with -wici occurs. Another peculiarity of
Uchumataqu's pronominal system is the form kun, which appears to be the pronoun
of second person singular and is preferrably applied in interrogative clauses, although
it occurs in sentence types too. Its function and meaning is not fully understood.
      Uchumataqu has four postpositions, one of which, kos 'inside', can be inflected
with nominal locative marker -ta.
      As in the majority of South American languages, the verbal system of
Uchumataqu is rather complex, although some of its aspects can be described only
vaguely due to the incomplete sources and the progressive attrition of Uchumataqu
reflected in them. In the verbal system the two prefixes mentioned above can be
observed. The marker s- appears to have been still productive at the time of
documentation and marks a first person singular as object. The second prefix ke-
indicating 'return' had already been lexicalised on kepic- 'return' when Uchumataqu
was documented. However, the use of prefixes is exceptional among the Andean
languages. Uchumataqu has a tense system, which primarily distinguishes future /
non-future, although there are markers for past, present and future tense. Only a first
singular is clearly indicated in present and future tense by the markers -u and -a.
There are no bound morphemes for any other person, with the exception of In-Group
marker -acu referring to first plural inclusive, which, however, may have an aspectual
quality. Only a few aspectual suffixes are found in the sources, probably due to the
circumstances of data collection and the increasing attrition of Uchumataqu. Other
verbal markers are nominalising -ni and -s(i), two subordination markers, of which
only gerund -ku can be satisfactorily interpreted, and irrealis -aca, which fulfills
several functions, such as marking conditional or Deontic modality.
     The general order of verbal affixes is that grammatical function marking affixes,
aspectual suffixes, subordinating and switch reference marking suffixes, the valence
changing suffix as well as nominalising and adjectival state marking suffixes cluster
around the verb stem. These suffixes appear to be mutually exclusive. They can be
followed by the validational suffix -kala, which is a verbal suffix. Mood, modality,
and portmanteau suffixes expressing tense and person are the last verbal suffixes to
be attached. Verbs can take one or two of the clausal clitics -pini, -ki, or -cay2, which
themselves can be followed by one of the personal clitics -/, -tn, or -s.
     On a clausal level, Uchumataqu has the following clitics: declarative -cay, topic
marker -ki, and affirmative -pini3. Another peculiarity of Uchumataqu is the use of

    Affirmative -pini and declarative -cay can be combined.

CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                      5
the personal clitics -/, -m, and -s, which refer to first, second, and third person,
respectively. Although their usage in the sources appears to be mainly emphatic,
there are also hints that these clitics had a person marking function in a more intact
stage of Uchumataqu. This is particularly reflected in interrogative and imperative
clauses. Uchumataqu is predominantly an SOV language but it allows great variation
with respect to word order. Interrogative devices are the interrogative pronouns and
the use of question markers -ta and -xwi; the latter is an allomorph of topic marker -ki
used in questions. In most cases, declarative -cay does not occur in interrogative
clauses, although there are some yes / no questions in which it is used. Although the
number of relative clauses is severely limited in my data, it appears that they are built
with nominalising subject relativiser -ni and are prenominai in nature, corresponding
to the basic SOV word order. The available examples suggest that relativisation in
Uchumataqu is restricted to subjects.","[19, 20, 21, 22]"
"4.2.5.1.2 Question marker -ta
The question marker -ta requires some additional comments. In Uhle (1894), its
regular use is testified but in later documents it is found less and less. In Vellard
(1967) -ta is used only occasionally on the interrogative pronoun kasu, but otherwise
does not appear any more. In Muysken (2005) it has entirely vanished. Therefore, the
following statements are based mainly on Uhle's data.
     The question marker -ta is mostly attached to the interrogative pronoun, less
often to a personal pronoun, and hardly ever to the subject of a phrase. It is not used
obligatorily, and we find a general tendency to delete the question marker -ta after
case marking suffixes on interrogative pronouns when these appear at the beginning
of a phrase (e.g. example 99) (cf. Uhle 1894:55). Accordingly, there is a tendency to
employ -ta on pure interrogative stems (119) and often the element which -ta is
attached to is not positioned at the beginning of a phrase (97). The use of -ta seems to
be reinforcing rather than purely marking an utterance as interrogative.

              who-QM     you     father-TOP

According to Vellard (1967:26) -ki and -xwi are interrogative particles. The use of
-xwi is limited to the work of Vellard (1949-67) and does not occur in other
documents. Despite its uncertain origin it is clear that -xwi is not a loan from Aymara
or Quechua.
(120)         culfuj tuti   am-xwi
              what name you-QTP
              'What is your name?' (lit: 'What name is yours?') (Vellard 1967:19)
Although Vellard labelled -ki a question marker, it appears in declarative clauses, too.
Furthermore, interrogative clauses are regularly built without -ki. The same is true for
-xwi: the majority of interrogative clauses is constructed without it (tab. 4.13),
although it is worth to note that -xwi is restricted to interrogative clauses. Neither -ki
nor -xwi are attached to the interrogative pronoun itself (tab. 4.14 and 4.15). These
aspects point into the direction that none of these elements is a question marking
suffix. Instead, -ki might be seen as the topic marker.
      Both morphemes show a tendency to occur on nouns and pronouns and they
appear in complementary distribution. It is the last point that gives rise to the
assumption that -xwi may well be an allomorph of Topic marker -ki. It then has to be
glossed as question bound topic marker (QTP) since its scope is strictly limited to
interrogative clauses. If -xwi is an allomorph of topic marker -ki, there has been a  For the difference between apa and ep, cf. 3.6 4

phonological shift from the plosive Ikl to a labialised fricative /xw/. What induced this
shift is uncertain but we may assume that it is at least in part due to the attrition of
Uchumataqu.
      Vellard (1967) presents three examples which may be interpreted as instances of
the question bound topic marker, although their form differs from this suffix (121).
However, since these instances occur only in interrogative clauses, I propose a
reading as the question bound topic marker.(121)          culu si-si-n-aki        wir-xo

4.3 Adjectives
The core function of adjectives is to qualify a noun, but for many languages it is
problematic to state whether they have a separate class of adjectives or not.
Adjectives sometimes stand between nouns and verbs, and in many languages
concepts that in other languages are expressed as adjectives are encoded as either
nouns or verbs; and often the situation is not entirely clear.
     In Uchumataqu, adjectival concepts are in general not encoded as verbs429, but
the situation is not so clear when it comes to the difference between nouns and
adjectives. In the following I will discuss whether Uchumataqu has a separate class
of adjectives or not 430 .
     There are some morphosyntactic and semantic means to state whether a
language has adjectives. The most common way to do so is to look at morphology,' l29 In fact, there are at least two adjectival concepts that are encoded verbally. These are 'to be tired' oc-
and 'to be ill' asi- Maybe also the notion of 'to be sad' is expressed verbally but there the situation is not
entirely clear. These cases are viewed as exceptions but not as a general means to express adjectival
concepts.
""""This discussion is limited to ""descriptive adjectives"" because ""limiting adjectives"" (Dixon 1982:3) as
numbers and expressions such as 'this','other', or 'much' behave morphologically different (cf 4 2 3;
4.3.4, 4.4)
198                       UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
i.e. do nominal markers also attach to adjectival concepts? Or are adjectival concepts
morphologically marked distinctly from nouns?
      As Croft (2003:185) points out for a theory of markedness, adjectives are
prototypically morphologically unmarked in modifying position, but they are marked
when used as nouns or in predicative function. Nouns, on the other hand, derived
from adjectives are marked as derivations, e.g. 'happi-ness' in English (2003:185).
Another characteristic of adjectives is their ability to function in comparative
constructions (Schachter 1985:14).
      With regard to semantics Dixon (1982:13) points out that if a language has
adjectives at all, at least the concepts of dimension (e.g. tall), colour (e.g. red) and
value (e.g. good) as a universal tendency, will be encoded as adjectives ('Languages
that have only a limited class of adjectives show considerable similarity in the
concepts that are expressed through adjectives.' Dixon 1982:3). Furthermore, if there
exists a class of adjectives there tend to be antonyms.
      In Uchumataqu, adjectival concepts are not marked for case suffixes or the
plural marker -naka. The only morphological markers they have in common with
nouns are clausal clitics such as declarative -cay and Topic marker -ki.
      With regard to morphological marking, adjectival concepts in a modifying
position usually do not take morphological markers at all. In predicative function
they often take the predicator -kasi (cf. 4.3.2.1), which also occurs on e.g. manner
adverbs, such as e.g. nisu-kasi 'so' 431 . Adjectives can be further modified by adverbs.
      The adverb iya 'more' is used to increase the degree of the meaning embodied in
an adjectival concept and in this sense contributes to some kind of comparison (122).
For true comparisons between two entities separative -kistana is used (cf. 4.1.1.4).
(122)        wata      iya-cay       aski-n
             village more-DEC far-?
             'The village is further away.'                   (Métraux 1935:104)
With respect to semantics, no nouns derived from adjectives could be found in
Uchumataqu but there are lexically distinct words for semantically related concepts
such as 'the cold', hipu and '(to be) cold', saki. This is evidence of a separate class of
adjectives. There are also antonym pairs among adjectival concepts in Uchumataqu,
e.g. coq, 'great' and uca, 'small, little'. With regard to morphology, the antonym
pairs behave similarly to each other and to other typical adjectival concepts as e.g.
value (cf. Table 4.17). The concepts proposed by Dixon (1982:13) as universally
apparent if a language has adjectives at all, appear mostly as modifiers in
Uchumataqu. As such, they do not take any special morphological markers but are
mostly inflected with -kasi when they occur in predicative function. The expression
cuni 'good' can function as an adjective as well as an adverb (cf. 6.1.4).
     As one can see from Table 4.16, most of the criteria are fulfilled by Uchumataqu
so one can speak of a separate class of adjectives found in this language. I propose an
open class of adjectives (Dixon 1982) because no restricting mechanisms can be
431
    In Uchumataqu, adverbs stand between nouns and adjectives and some adverbs can therefore be
inflected with the predicator -kasi For a more detailed discussion, cf 6.1.

stated. But I would also like to point out that there is no clear-cut distinction and that
there are some exceptions where adjectival concepts are encoded as either nouns or
verbs (e.g. oc-u 'I am tired', lit: 'I do tire' Uhle: 1894:89.1).","[213, 214, 215, 216]"

AcknowledgementsFirst and foremost, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my promoter Pieter
Muysken, without whom this project would have been impossible. I am very grateful
for his never ending support and confidence in this project. He commented on every
section and chapter and his insightful and inspiring suggestions guided me through
the project, which was at times a difficult one. Whenever I approached him with
whatever difficulty I faced, I was given the feeling that nothing but the solution to my
problem mattered and he supported me in every possible way.
      I am likewise deeply indebted to Hein van der Voort, with whom I was lucky
enough to share an office for a time. The entire manuscript and particularly the
chapter on phonology profited from his invaluable comments and incredible patience.
I would also like to thank Mily Crevels and Simon van de Kerke, together with Hein
van der Voort editors of this grammar. Mily Crevels and Simon van de Kerke
contributed to the manuscript with useful comments and support during the
formatting, which at times was quite challenging.
      My thanks also go to Sabine Dedenbach-Salazar Saenz, who was my
copromoter in this project and the one who brought me into contact with Uru-
Chipaya. Without her very sharp eye for details, many inconsistencies and
contradictions not only in the manuscript would have gone unnoticed.
      I would also like to thank Willem Adelaar for his interest in my research, his
inspiring comments on the manuscript, and his support on many other topics.
      Many other people contributed to the study of Uchumataqu, either by
commenting on sections and chapters or by their helpful remarks and suggestions on
presentations: Astrid Alexander-Bakkerus, Susanne Brouwer, Hanke van Buren,
Eithne Carlin, Wolfgang Dietrich, Rafael Fischer, Rik van Gijn, Jesus Mario Giron,
Katharina Haude, Roland Hemmauer, Gertie Hoyman, Peter Masson, Sergio Meira,
Hella Olbertz, Kees Versteegh, and Otto Zwartjes. My research always profited from
their useful comments and critics. Furthermore, I would like to thank Amo Zweden,
who often was my last resort when my Dutch failed me.
      I am particularly grateful to my former office mate Swintha Danielsen and to
Sonja Gipper for all the discussions we had, be they on linguistic or non-linguistic
topics. Without their opinion, advice and often enough help, things would have been
much more difficult. I hope this is the only the beginning of further collaboration.
      I am also indebted to the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin that gave me
free and uncomplicated access the invaluable manuscripts of Max Uhle and Walter
Lehmann on Uchumataqu (Uru). My thanks go particularly to Gregor Wolff, who
was very co-operative about my archive research. Furthermore, I would like to thank
Colette Grinevald, who allowed me to use her personal notes on her visit to Irohito
and provided me with interesting and useful background information on the language
situation in Bolivia.
      In Bolivia, my thanks go to don Lorenzo Inda and his family in Irohito, who
hosted me and answered any of my questions, regardless whether I wished to know
something about their former language or about a trivial matter of everyday life.
Without their friendliness and hospitality, I could not have gained the insight I had in
the present-day situation of the Uru people. I am also grateful to Ciriaco Inda, who
spent his rare time with me pondering on the meaning of words and phrases. Without
Vladimir Salazar I would not have been able to meet the Inda family and I would like
to express my gratitude for his energy and unending support. Whenever I met a
problem, he tried to solve it for me and his profound knowledge of Bolivian society
was an invaluable help, not only to my research but also to my well-being. When it
comes to well-being, I am likewise deeply indebted to Trini Betancourt, who took
care for me in La Paz, treated me like her daughter, and sometimes made the
impossible possible. I also owe many thanks to the native speakers of Chipaya. Their
interest in Uchumataqu and unending patience with my questions enabled me to
comprehend Uchumataqu and its relation to Chipaya better than could have done any
book. Without their help, the film Vellard made about the Uru would be nothing but
beautiful pictures.
      This is the place to thank my close friends in Bonn: Christiane, Sabine, Moritz,
Christian, and Alexis. They showed the greatest understanding for me and my
sometimes unusual situation. Without them, the years of thesis writing would have
been less happy.
      Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my grandparents for
their ever-lasting care and my mother for wanting me to be happy and for picking up
the receiver every time I called.
      Any mistake and error this book may contain is entirely mine.","[7, 8, 9]"
"4.2.5.1.1 The second person singular kun
The form kun requires some discussion. It can be interpreted as a second person
singular pronoun and in seventeen out of 25 cases it occurs in interrogative clauses.
Vellard (1967:26) points to this: ""kù [...] an interrogative particle, which is placed at
the beginning of a phrase.""423 That is, the form kun may be interpreted as a second
person singular personal pronoun restricted to interrogative clauses (112 and 113).
(112)          luli  kun-ki      pek
               food you-TOP      want
               'Do you want food?'                                  (Polo 1901:479)

               'You will return, won't you?'                        (Métraux 1935:106)
What is particularly remarkable is that (with the exception of Uhle and Lehmann) all
documents use both am and kun, although am is by far the more common form. What
is the origin of kun. It may be possible that it is a loan from Aymara cuna 'what?'
(DeLucca 1983:73), with which it shares an interrogative meaning. However, since
cuna means 'what?' and kun clearly denotes a second person singular 'you?', this
proposition seems only partly appropriate. Yet another possibility is that kun derives
from Aymara personal pronoun xuma*24 'you' (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981:122). In this
case, the initial fricative oïxuma would have been replaced by a stop, while the final
vowel /a/ got lost and the bilabial nasal Imi became alveolar Ini. Strikingly, Aymara
xuma is not restricted to interrogative clauses. On the other hand, it is less likely that

borrows only one single pronoun and furthermore changes it considerably with
respect to meaning and / or phonological form. Even if we assume that kun is a native
form of Uchumataqu, it is still remarkable that the language has only one specific
personal pronoun used in interrogative clauses and not a complete set of them.
Finally, it may be possible that kun is the remainder of an older pronominal paradigm
(cf. 4.1.4), but we lack sufficient data to further pursue this claim. In sum, I cannot
provide a satisfying answer to the question of the origin of kun, but would like to
point out that it appears in Polo (1901), Métraux (1935), Vellard (1949, 1951, 1967),
and possibly in Muysken (2005). With respect to morphology, we find that kun takes
clausal clitics and nominal markers (115).

Apart from the examples quoted so far, there are other instances, where what appears
to be kun carries unanalysable elements. Please consider (116).

The form kun is transcribed in several ways. The more common forms are: kum,
kumi, and cun (each found three times), while ku appears two times, and kuma, can[-
Jcu, kon f-J tais426, and kam are single instances. The form kun itself is used ten times
in the data.
     As mentioned above, in eight cases kun appears in non-interrogative clauses as
well (cf. 116). I have no explanation for this. In (118), chun421 is used to denote a
direct object, a use not found elsewhere.

The second derivation cul-ura-sa 'when' is highly lexicalised and does not allow any
variation. There, the Uchumataqu basic interrogative pronoun is combined with
Spanish hora 'hour' and the Aymara marker for information questions -sa (Huayhua
Pari 2001:278).

The form kasu 'how many' can be regarded as the most specified interrogative
pronoun since its use is strictly limited to count nouns. It is not attested for Muysken
(2005) any more but has been replaced by culu.

With regard to morphological marking different case markers can be applied to the
interrogative pronoims, depending on their semantics (38, 39) (cf. tab 4.12). Both hek
and kasu can take plural marker -naka, too, although this must be viewed as an
exception. Personal clitics (99) and question marker -ta (98, 111) can be attached to
every interrogative pronoun.

In most cases interrogative pronouns are the first element of a clause. However, they
can be preceded by demonstrative pronouns, possessive pronouns or phrases (40), as
well as by personal pronouns.

Table 4.12: Distribution of case markers on interrogative pronouns4.2.5.1 Question marking related phenomena
The following sections will be concerned with pronominal features used in question
formation. I will first describe the second person singular pronoun kun before turning
to the question marker -ta, and the question bound topic marker -xwi.","[209, 210, 211]"
"7.6.1 Information questions
As imperative clauses, interrogative clauses convey a low degree of certainty
expressed by the speaker and are thus not marked with declarative -coy634. Specific
markers are the interrogative pronouns themselves (cf. 4.2.5), the question marker -ta
(cf. 4.2.5.1.2), and the question bound topic marker -xwi (found only in Vellard's
data; cf. 4.2.5.1.3).
(45)       culu-tfaj am tu
           what-QM you name
           'What is your (sg) name?'                                    (Uhle 1894:53)

           'Whose house is it?'                                         (Vellard 1951:34)
As indicated in (46), interrogative pronouns can be inflected with nominal case
markers. The interrogative pronoun may occur with the verbal predicate alone (47) or
the question may consist of the interrogative pronoun and a predicate clause (45, 46).
(47)       culu-m     peki
           what-CL=2 want
           'What do you want?'                                          (Métraux 1935:105)
Apart from these peculiarities, word order does not differ from the most common
types found in declarative clauses, i.e. SOV, SV, or OV. Since the interrogative
pronoun already marks the construction as not being declarative, no particular word
order is required. As with simple declarative clauses, deviations from these types
occur but represent only a minority within the group of information questions.
     Particularly in Uhle's data (1894) do we find a frequent repetition of the subject
or subject pronoun. Whether this is an emphatic device or a peculiarity of
interrogative clauses remains uncertain.",[296]
"4.1 3 Comitative-instrumental -stani
The comitative-instrumental case marker -stani is attached to the stem of nouns,
personal, interrogative, and demonstrative pronouns and can be followed by Topic
marker -ki or declarative -cay although this happens only infrequently. Comitative-
instrumental -stani marks either accompaniment (49) or an instrument (50) and in
both cases it is translated as 'with'. Two different agents are connected by double
inflection with -stani (51). In this case the translation is 'and'. When -stani marks
accompaniment, it is glossed as comitative (COM); when it refers to an Instrument, it
is glossed as Instrument (INS). As an oblique case marker comitative-instrumental -
stani is not selected by verb semantics.

In an extended meaning comitative-instrumental -stani can also express the notion of
'to be provided with (something)'.

180                      UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Comitative-instrumental -stani attaches to the interrogative pronouns hek- 'who?' and
kasu- 'how many?' to question accompaniment. In the case of kasu-, it may also
express the extended meaning of 'being provided with'.
(54)      hek-stan(i) am am-ki     cis(i)              tafnj-ni ok-aki

          'How many brothers do you have?'
          (lit: 'With how many brothers are you?')     (Vellard 1967:24)
The case marker also attaches to the interrogative pronoun culu- 'what?' to mark
either a question about the instrument ('with what?') or to build the interrogative
pronoun 'why?'. It is in the latter case that we find a free alternation with separative
-kistana, which is also found on culu- to form the interrogative pronoun 'why?' (cf.
4.1.1.5 and 4.2.5). This free alternation between -stani and -kistana occurs only with
verbs that do not require a directional marker, like e.g. qaw- 'cry'. With verbs that do
require directional marking, either separative -kistana or directional -kina are used
instead of comitative-instrumental -stani (cf. 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.5).
      The alternative form -toni appears lexicalised on pikil- or pukul- and cepul-tani
where it attaches to a numeral pisk 'two' or cep 'three'. The numeralpisk(i) 'two' has
been modified and appears in the form of either pik- or puk-. In this function -(s)tani
marks a unity and can be translated as 'together' or 'the two / three of. There is no
difference between pikiltani and pukultani, so they are regarded as allomorphs. The
use of pikil- /pukultani and cepultani, respectively, is restricted to human beings.
      The comitative is bound to the numeral stem by means of the linking element -ul
or -/'/. The linking element does not have a meaning of its own but serves only to
connect the numeral stem to comitative -stani. The vowel of the linking element is
determined by the vowel of the stem. It is likely that especially -il is of the same
origin as the linking vowel -i that occurs between the personal pronouns of first and
second person singular and their clitic elements (cf. 4.2.1).

          'I see [the] three man together on the road.' (Métraux 1935:110)
No phonetic rules can be stated which determine the distribution of -stani and -toni.
The same is true for the deletion of final I'll, although there is a tendency to keep it
before consonants and on final elements in a clause but this does not work as a rule.
As a fixed expression, pikiltan(i) or pukultan(i) do not take -stani but -toni.","[196, 197]"
"6.1.7 The adverbial use of affirmative -pini
Affirmative -pini is a loan from Aymara where it expresses affirmation (Porterie-
Gutiérrez 1981:33If) and can be translated as 'truly' or 'for sure'. It is a clausal clitic
(cf. 7.2.3). Uchumataqu adopted these functions and affirmative -pini occurs in all
adverbial subclasses appearing regularly on adverbs expressing degree. With time
adverbs and adverbs of location and direction, we may assume that the marker
signals Affirmation, as demonstrated in example (27).

    Provided -kacu is an instance ofpredicator -kasi, example (17) is in contrast to this finding since it is
not an attributive predicate clause. No suitable explanation can be given

With manner adverbs and adverbs expressing degree, affirmative -pini marks an
increased degree In this function, it can be translated as 'very', 'really' or, even more
extended, 'enormously' (cf examples (14), (20), and (23))
(28)      luwa luwa           luwa-pim-cay
          quick quick         quick-AFF-DEC
          'very quickly'      'very / really quickly'   (Vellard 1951 13)
Only in its affirmative function does affirmative -pint come close to what according
to Schachter (1985 20) signals the speaker's attitude towards the predication When it
occurs on manner adverbs or adverbs expressing degree, it looses this function and
becomes a mere way of increasing degree, which does not say anything about the
speaker's attitude
     With respect to word order, we find four possible positions the adverb can take
In most cases, it precedes the entire clause which may be regarded as the unmarked
position (pos 1) Another common and probably equally unmarked position is
preceding the verb, adverb, or adjective it modifies (pos 2) This position is in some
cases identical to the one preceding the entire clause The adverb can also appear at
the end of the clause which is less common than its position at the beginning (pos 3)
Accordingly, the adverb occurs sometimes after the item
it modifies although it does so less often (pos 4) Again, this position is in some
cases identical to the one following the entire clause In comparison to the position
preceding the modified item or entire clause, the position following it is possibly
marked in some way although it remains uncertain why or in what way it is marked
     There are only a few deviations from these positions We can only assume that
these deviations denote highly marked positions but it is impossible to provide
further explanations for the reason or meaning of these deviations6 2 Postpositions
In most languages, the distinction between case markers and adpositions is not
discreet one and the following definition is described as a ""[r]ule of thumb"" by Payne
(1997 100) However, I would like to adopt this definition for the following section
on postpositions
         Case marking is the morphosyntactic categorization of noun phrases that is
         imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase occurs Adpositions
         are free of such configurational constraints (Payne 1997 100)
Thus, adpositions may be seen as providing some additional semantic information on
the noun phrase they refer to and accordingly, are not required by verb semantics
     Adpositions in Uchumataqu are postpositions and some morphological features
help to clarify their status as postpositions To differing degrees, they are able to
combine with morphological markers other than clausal clitics which is not possible
for case markers In one case (see below), the postposition mora 'middle' follows a
case marker and it would be highly unusual for Uchumataqu to have two case markes
on one word In most case, a noun cames only one morphological marker (cf 3 2)
Only for huntani 'on, above' do we have to refer to Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino
260                      UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
2006:141) since the expression does not provide any hints to its status, i.e. it could be
a case marker as well. However, huntani 'on, above' can be equated with the Chipaya
postposition huni 'on, above' and thus, we may assume that huntani in Uchumataqu
is a postposition, too.
      In Uchumataqu, we find four postpositions which are huntani 'on, above', kesu
'close to', mora 'middle', and kos 'inside'. Each of these will be presented below.6.2.1 huntani 'on, above'
The postposition huntani 'on, above' does not combine with other markers except for
declarative -cay.
(29)      wes       huntani-cay potsi

          'The knife is on the blanket.'                          (Uhle 1894:64)
It is possible that huntani consists of a stem *hun followed by locative marker -ta (cf.
4.1.1.4) and an element -ni. The latter may be in some way related to the subject
relativiser -ni but it is not the marker itself since locative -ta already is a nominal
suffix. However, the postposition huntani probably was lexicalised at the time of its
documentation and thus, has to be considered a lexeme.6.2.2 kesu 'close to '
The postposition kesu is translated as 'close to'.
(30)      oeisa    kesu       kuasi-cay
          sheep    close to water-DEC
          'The sheep is close to the water.'                      (Métraux 1935:105)

          'The little village is close.'                          (Muysken 2005:26)
It can be combined with predicator -kasi and declarative -cay. It is particularly
predicator -kasi that confirms the status of kesu as a postposition since a case marker
cannot appear in a predicative position, such as shown in example (32).
(32)      kesu-kaci-cay
          close tO-PRE-DEC
          'It is close.'                                          (Vellard 1951:14)6.2.3 mora 'middle'
The postposition mora means 'middle' and no example is found where it is combined
with other morphological markers. However, since huntani 'on, above' and kesu
'close to' can be combined with at least declarative -cay, we may assume that mora,
too, can be followed by clausal clitics.
CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                           261

Although mora is a postposition, there is one case in which it precedes the noun it
refers to. It is uncertain whether this reversed order is highly marked or due to
language attrition.

            'We will place ourselves onto the middle of the road.' (Uhle 1894:17)
The following example confirms that mora is a postposition and not a case marker.
(35)        //' tapa        cufkij    xin-kinfaj ya-ki        maska-kifnaj mora
            this pepper we            stock-DlR put-TOP pot-DlR              middle
            'Let us put this pepper into the stock, into the pot in the middle.'

As shown in the example clause, the form mora follows the directional case marker
-kina which would be impossible if mora itself was another case marker.6.2.4kos 'inside'
The last postposition to be discussed is kos 'inside'. With respect to morphology, kos
differs to a certain degree from the other postpositions in that it can be combined with
nominal markers, such as directional locative -ski and locative -ta. This is a proof that
kos indeed is postpositional in nature.

            'I will stay inside the house.'                                (Vellard 1967:30)
Postposition kos also combines with the form -carku '-wards' (cf. 6.1.2, and example
(10)).
(37)        kos-carku

In the following example, the meaning of kos is slightly changed to 'under'. This
becomes explicable if the table is viewed as a square with the legs forming its sides
and thus, building a closed space.

    The use of object marker -n is somewhat sinking here. It is possible that it reflects the locative object,
in the sense of 'stay in it (= house)'

The morpheme ana negates entire clauses as well as noun, verb, pronominal, and
adjectival phrases, i.e. it can occur with all parts of speech. It has several translations
depending on the context. According to the morphological markers or lexemes ana
can be combined with, four categories can be distinguished. They will be presented
below.
     The basic meaning of ana is 'no' or 'not' and in this function, the negation
appears either without any morphological marking at all (example 40) or combines
with clitic elements (41). However, in most cases, ana is not marked at all.
(40)        ana k""asi tun-n-aki-cay         tiks-n-aki-caysn
            NEG water come-OB2-FU-DEC die-OB2-FU-DEC
            'No water [= rain] will come, we will die.' (Vellard 1949:152)
(41)        tomxe-ki ana-l            t(a)xa-cay wir-ki
            today-TOP NEG-CL=1 sleep-DEC I-TOP
            'Today, I did not sleep.'594                (Uhle 1894:12b)
Declarative -cay is attached to the negation ana only as an exception.
(42)        ana-cay tuku          saki
            NEG-DEC yet           cold
            'It is not cold yet.'                                    (Métraux 1935:98)
With respect to its position, ana almost always precedes the element it negates, i.e. it
appears either at the beginning of the entire clause or precedes the phrase it refers to.
Sometimes the position at the beginning of a clause coincides with the one preceding
the negated phrase (e.g. example 40). Only in one case does ana appear at the end of
a clause and there, it is used to build a tag question. Since the construction in (43) is
the only one of this type found in the sources, it is impossible to state whether it is a

CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                        263
regular construction and what its exact meaning is. However, we may assume that the
position of ana is marked in some way in order to form the tag question.
(43)        kun kepck-aki ana(-cay)
            you retum-FU NEG(-DEC)
            'You (sg) will return, won't you?'                           (Métraux 1935:106)
When the negation is inflected with affirmative -pini, the meaning of ana extends to
'never', thereby reflecting the affirmative sense of -pini. Thus, -pini rules out the
basic meaning of ana. Affirmative -pini itself can be combined with declarative -cay.
(44)        ana    xuwa sels-cay ana-pini slekisini
            NEG    totora be-DEC NEG-AFF duck egg
            'There is no totora, [there are] never [again] duck eggs.'
                                                               (Vellard 1949:151)
In one instance, ana is inflected with certainty -kala (cf. 5.9) which takes a position
normally reserved for affirmative -pini since certainty -kala is a verbal and
affirmative -pini a clausal clitic.
(45)        kuya tax-cay sax-aki-cay ana-kala ci cuna
            house roof-DEC drip-FU-DEC NEG-CERT one good
            'It will drip from the roof of the house (lit: 'the roof of the house will
            drip'); it is [certainly] not good.'
            ('ku-ya tax-cay sax-r-kicay hana Kala c/'-cwna') (Vellard 1949:166)
Since affirmative -pini is a more recent loan from Aymara (Porterie-Gutiérrez
1981:331f), its occurence is limited to the works of Vellard (1949-67) and Muysken
(2005) (cf. 7.2.3). In all cases, the emphasised negative expression ana-pini- precedes
the item it refers to.
      So far, morphological processes have been discussed. The following will deal
with lexical processes involving negative morpheme ana. It can be combined with
indefinite pronouns in order to build negative indefinite pronouns595 (see 4.2.4). It
occurs with hek 'who' (only attested for Uhle 1894), culu or ci-culu 'something'596,
cila 'another', and the lexical expression ti suni 'this man'. Depending on the
indefinite pronoun, the resulting expression means either 'no one, nobody', 'nothing',
or 'not one'. Although negative ana can be inflected with clausal and personal clitics
(examples 46, 47), its scope is over the indefinite pronoun, i.e. an expression as e.g.
ana-pini hek means 'certainly no one' and not 'never one' (example mine). Thus, the
combination of ana and an indefinite pronoun rules out the meaning a clausal clitic
has on the negation on its own (example 47). The indefinite pronouns themselves can
take nominal or clausal clitics but in most cases they are not marked at all.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280]"

In possessive predicate clauses -kistana is used to mark a question for the possessor:
(21)        ti ckal-kstan(i) hek-ta                 duenu-ki
            this field-SEP who-QM                   owner-TOP
            'Who is the owner of this                 field?'             (Uhle 1894:53)365(22)        hek-i-s-kistana kuya-xwi

This function is limited to interrogative clauses since possession is otherwise
expressed by either the possessive suffix -/ (only first person singular) or by word
order (possessor-possessed) (cf. 4.1.2 and 4.2.2). Whereas it does not seem to be a
common function of the separative, we find a rather frequent use of -kistana in
interrogative clauses. There, it is attached to the basic interrogative pronoun culu-
'what' to form the more specific cul-k(i)sta 'why' (lit: 'what from?').
(23)        cul-ksta am am-k(i) pis-cay
            what-SEP you you-TOP come-DEC
            'Why do you come?'                                            (Uhle 1894:23)

Separative -kistana is also employed to mark a temporal separative as in culura-si-
kstafni/66, 'since when?'.
(25)        culuras-fkisjtani am sel am-ki        (Hanqohaqe)
            when-SEP           you be you-TOP Ancoaqui
            'Since when are you (sg) in Ancoaqui?'        (Uhle 1894:55)    The divergent ending -i instead of-a is possibly a dummy element (cf. 2.12.2).

At last, separative -kistana is also applied in comparisons between two entities.
(26)       wir-ki am-ksta(na) yuk     q'a:-ci:-cay
           I-TOP you-SEP        much money-POS-DEC

           (\..yukq^äcïca,)                          (Uhle 1894:71)
As can be expected -kistana appears most often with motion verbs like ol- or ul(an)-
'leave', pic- 'come', and ox- 'go'. Another use of separative -kistana is with verbs
that express an inherent direction, like resiw?61 'receive'. However, in the majority
of cases -kistana is employed in either interrogative or possessive clauses.
     Separative -kistana appears in a lexicalised constructions as nekstani or nikstam
'then, afterwards', where a demonstrative pronoun ni 'that' has been combined with -
kistana, literally 'that away from'. The form nekstani is limited to express a temporal
adverb.
(27)       wir-i-l     niksta okw[a]-a-cay
           I-LV-CL=1   then gO-FU-DEC
           'Then [afterwards] I will go.'                        (Vellard 1967:31)
Separative -kistana shows a great variety of different forms, which range from
-kistana to forms like -tam, -stam/n, or -sta. However, no phonological,
morphological, or syntactic rules can be shown to determine their distribution.
Therefore they have to be considered as mere alternative forms, probably due to rapid
speech.","[187, 188, 189]"

Samenvatting
De taal Uchumataqu werd ooit gesproken in de omgeving van het Titicacameer en
langs de bovenloop van de Desaguadero rivier, maar is rond 1950 uitgestorven. Het
onderwerp van dit onderzoek is de gemeenschap Irohito (Noordwest Bolivia). Dit
dorp was één van de laatste nederzettingen in het noorden van Bolivia waar de
bevolking Uchumataqu sprak. Het aantal sprekers is waarschijnlijk altijd vrij klein
geweest: waarschijnlijk nooit meer dan 150 sprekers. Het Uchumataqu vormt samen
met het gerelateerde dialect Chipaya de taalfamilie Uru-Chipaya. Deze wordt gezien
als een geïsoleerde taalfamilie.
      Verschillende onderzoekers hebben Irohito bezocht, totdat een ernstige droogte,
gedurende de jaren 40 van de 20e eeuw, een einde maakte aan het Uchumataqu als
een gesproken taal. De Duitse taalwetenschapper Max Uhle was de eerste die
linguïstische gegevens heeft verzameld in Irohito in 1894. Hij werd gevolgd door
José T. Polo, Zenón Bacarreza, Walter Lehmann, Alfred Métraux en Jehan (Jean)
Vellard. Vellard heeft als laatste gesproken Uchumataqu opgenomen. Het door Uhle
en Lehmann verzameld materiaal bleef ongepubliceerd. Recent onderzoek in de jaren
90 van de 20de eeuw en het begin van de 21ste eeuw werd uitgevoerd door Colette
Grinevald en Pieter Muysken.
      Dit boek bevat de eerste grondige beschrijving van het Uchumataqu waarbij
ieder onderzoek, gepubliceerd of ongepubliceerd, naar het Uchumataqu wordt
betrokken. Dit onderzoek is gebaseerd op de voorheen genoemde onderzoeken en de
gegevens die daarin zijn verzameld. Observaties over de huidige situatie in Irohito
werden verkregen gedurende een veldonderzoekdoor de auteur. Het veldwerk werd
uitgevoerd in Irohito.
      In hoofdstuk 1 worden de sociale, geografische en historische achtergronden van
Irohito en het Uchumataqu beschreven. De genetische verwantschap binnen de Uru-
Chipaya taalfamilie wordt bediscussieerd en Uchumataqu en Chipaya worden met
elkaar vergeleken. Hierna wordt een korte beschrijving gegeven van het theoretisch
kader en de gebruikte terminologie voor de grammaticale beschrijving, gevolgd door
een overzicht van de geschiedenis van Irohito. Het laatste gedeelte van het hoofdstuk
gaat in op de studies die als grondslag voor dit boek gebruikt zijn.
   Hoofdstuk 2 gaat over het fonologische systeem van het Uchumataqu. De
medeklinkers en klinkers worden eerst geïntroduceerd, waama de klanken die in
leenwoorden voorkomen worden behandeld. Dit wordt gevolgd door de presentatie
van contextgevoelige processen. Binnen deze processen komt elisie van finale
klinkers het meest voor en leidt vaak tot verdere contextgevoelige processen. De
lettergreep en het klemtoonpatroon worden gepresenteerd voordat de representatie en
orthografie worden behandeld. Ik laat tot slot zien hoe de fonemen en allofonen van
het Uchumataqu in de manuscripten worden gepresenteerd.
      Hoofdstuk 3 geeft een overzicht van de morfologische processen. De termen
wortel, stam en woord worden behandeld voordat affixatie, clitische elementen,
samenstellingen, incorporatie en reduplicatie worden gepresenteerd. In het tweede
deel van hoofdstuk 3 worden de zinsdelen van Uchumataqu geïntroduceerd.
      In hoofdstuk 4 wordt het nominale systeem beschreven. Het begint met een
beschrijving van de nominale markeerders en de persoonlijke voornaamwoorden van
Uchumataqu Daarna worden de beschrijvende voornaamwoorden geïntroduceerd In
tegenstelling tot andere Andestalen heeft Uchumataqu een aparte klasse van
adjectieven Deze omvat twee subcategorieën kwantificerende adjectieven en
adjectieven van toestand In het laatste deel van het hoofdstuk wordt het numeneke
systeem beschreven
      Hoofdstuk 5 gaat in op het verbale systeem Het begint met de markering van
tijd, die opmerkelijk is, omdat Uchumataqu alleen de eerste persoon enkelvoud in de
tegenwoordige en toekomstige tijd apart markeert, terwijl alle andere personen
ongemarkeerd zijn Na de beschnjving van tijd volgt een presentatie van de
aspectuele affixen, waarvan slechts dne werden gevonden Dit relatief kleine aantal is
mogelijk het gevolg van taalverhes en de methoden van dataverzameling Binnen de
aspectuele affixen vinden we een prefix, dat tegenwoordig is gelexicaliseerd Na een
korte presentatie van het koppelwerkwoord worden de markeerders voor subject en
object geïntroduceerd Binnen die groep vinden we een ander prefix, een
subjectmarkeerder, dat nog productief gebruikt werd ten tijde van de documentatie
Het gebruik van prefixen in een Andestaal is opmerkelijk en niet bekend van het
Aymara of Quechua De causatieve markeerder wordt kort beschreven voordat de
nominahsatie- en onderschikkingsmarkeerders worden behandeld De begrippen van
modus en modaliteit worden geïntroduceerd in de daaropvolgende sectie In het
laatste gedeelte van het hoofdstuk wordt het validatieve suffix besproken
     Hoofdstuk 6 gaat in op bijwoorden, postposities en het negatiepartikel In
Uchumataqu worden temporale en ruimtelijke bijwoorden en bijwoorden van wijze
gecodeerd als zelfstandige naamwoorden, terwijl bijwoorden van graad en
bijwoorden die bijwoorden en adjectieven modificeren, zich gedragen als
adjectieven In het daaropvolgende deel worden de postposities behandeld Daarna
wordt het negatiepartikel gepresenteerd Uchumataqu heeft een negatiepartikel, dat
woorden, constituenten en hele zinnen ontkennend kan maken
     In hoofdstuk 7 worden de verschillende zinstypes van het Uchumataqu
beschreven Het hoofdstuk begint met een presentatie van clitische elementen,
waarvan de persoonlijke chtica uniek zijn in het Andesgebied Het volgende deel gaat
over de basale zinstypes declaratieve, imperatieve en vragende zinnen Daarna
worden predicatieve zinnen geïntroduceerd Dit wordt gevolgd door een behandeling
van complexe zinnen nevengeschikte zinnen, complementszinnen, adverbiale zinnen
en relatieve zinnen
     Een bijlage die de tussen 1894 en 2002 verzamelde gegevens en transcripties
van de materialen van Uhle en Lehmann bevat, is beschikbaar op de website van de

This book is the first comprehensive grammatical description of Uchumataqu, the lost
language of the Uru of Lake Titicaca in northwest Bolivia. Uchumataqu forms part of
the isolated Uru-Chipaya language family, which was influenced to different degrees
by Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish. The Uchumataqu language became extinct around
1950 and although several researchers had documented the language during the first
half of the 20th century, their results were never considered in a comprehensive
context. Some of the more substantial studies remained unpublished.
         This grammatical description is based on previous publications and archival
materials and provides the most complete treatment of Uchumataqu to date. The
study also comprises a detailed description of the data source situation as well as
a thorough introduction to previous research that resulted in the database for the
present book. In addition, it contains a description of the phonological system and
the morphological processes of Uchumataqu. The nominal and verbal systems are
discussed in detail. Particular attention is paid to the complex person-marking system,
of which the person-marking clitics distinguish Uchumataqu from the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Other important topics are nominalisation and
subordination strategies and the existence of a separate word class for adjectives.
The relationship between Uchumataqu and the surrounding Aymara and Quechua
languages is described in detail.
          This book will appeal especially to historical linguists, typologists and Andean
linguists, but it should also interest anthropologists, Americanists, and linguists in
general. In addition to its academic value, this book is a physical record of the extinct
Uchumataqu language for the descendants of its speakers.

"1.4.2.2 José T. Polo (1841-1918)
José Toribio Polo was bom in Ica in 1841 and went to Lima to study history at the
Convictorio de San Carlos and the Seminary of Santo Toribio but never completed
his studies there69 (Dager Alva 2000:147, footnote 48). Beside other occupations, he
worked at the Archive del Cabildo eclesiastico, the Tribunal de Cuentas, and the
Biblioteca Nacional, of which he was subdirector (Dager Alva 2000:137, footnote 3).
Polo died in Lima in 1918.
     According to Polo's profession the introduction to his work Indios uros del Peru
y Bolivia (1901) contains a detailed compilation of notes on the Uru in historical
sources, including a comparison of the historical representation of Cunza, Puquina,
and Uru (pp. 445-455). Since at that time Uchumataqu was considered to be identical
with or related to the historical Puquina mentioned by Ore (1607), Polo provides a
comparative word lists of Puquina-Uchumataqu-Spanish, which consists of twenty
items and includes the numerals 1-10 (p. 456). This list is followed by a Puquina
version of the Lord's Prayer (p. 456). Polo also adds a brief comparative word list
Atacameno-Uchumataqu of only seven items (p. 457). The following etymological
discussion of the name 'Uro' (p. 457) as well as some anthropological considerations
(pp. 459-463) are also dominated by historical considerations. These aspects make up
more than half of Polo's work on the Uru.
     The Uchumataqu-Spanish word list (pp. 464-479) itself consists of about 300
words, which are ordered according to the Spanish alphabet. It comprises nouns of
    As Dager Alva (2000.147) points out, at this time historiography was not a subject with an academic
tradition and it still lacked a unified methodology. Correspondingly, Dager Alva (2000:135) describes Polo
as belonging to a ""generation of historians in transition between an amateur-like history and a more
professional one""69. Regardless of these restrictions, Polo can be characterised as a historiographer and his
first and foremost field of activity was history
34                               UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
several semantic fields, e.g. kinship terms, body parts, clothing, domesticated and
non-domesticated animals as well as natural and religious phenomena, personal
pronouns, and numerals. The list further contains directions, adjectives, colour terms,
and verbs of every class. Polo adds footnotes that either explain in greater detail a
particular word or point to the Aymara or Quechua origin of the item. The author also
provides a list of fourteen Spanish loan words (p. 478) and about 30 phrases (p. 478-
479), which he considered to be of frequent use. They include the questions for food,
one's name, and one's well-being. Polo concludes his article with some brief remarks
on his spelling of Uchumataqu lexemes and some basic grammatical observations on
compounding, personal pronouns, numerals, adjectives, the negation ana, and kinship
terms. He also provides basic notes about the verbal tense system, adverbs, and the
agglutinative character of Uchumataqu (pp. 479-482).
      It is noteworthy that Polo does not use a particular phonological transcription
system but represents the Uchumataqu items by using the Spanish alphabet. The only
adaptation is that [kk], [pp], and [tt] are employed to ""reinforce the sound and also
distinguish certain words""70 (Polo 1901:480, translation mine).
      Polo remains vague about the circumstances under which he collected his data.
He mentions a small vocabulary by Augusto Benavides (Polo 1901:464), which he
used to compare it to his own data. Polo ascribes differences to either dialectal
variation or to a certain ""confusion on the Urus' part for being questioned in
Aymara""71 (Polo 1901:464, translation mine). It remains uncertain whether Polo
refers to Benavides' language consultants, who were confused for being questioned
in Aymara, or his own. In case he refers to his language consultants, it is still
unknown whether Polo spoke Aymara sufficiently to communicate directly with the
Uchumataqu speakers or whether he relied on an interpreter. Further, Polo does not
specify who his language consultants were, but since he uses a plural form when
refering to them he must have worked with at least two speakers. Polo was
accompanied by Javier Gonzalez del Valle, a professor at the Colegio National in
Puno, and Enrique Gamero, likewise a resident of Puno. The latter contributed to
Polo's article by collecting data in the villages of Ancoaqui and Ahuallamaya (Polo
 1901:463). Polo (ibid.) also expresses his thanks to Victor R. Cavinos, who left him
some words and phrases of Uchumataqu. Since both Gamero as well as Cavinos are
Spanish surnames, it is unlikely that they were native speakers of Uchumataqu and
therefore Polo's article does not only comprise his own data but also those of other
researchers, which, however, is not indicated in the word list itself. Thus, it remains
entirely unknown whom Polo worked with, whether he had an interpreter, and which
of the data result from his own field-work and which do not.
     However, Polo (1901:463) mentions that he visited the Lake Titicaca region in
February 1897 to collect his data, which then were published four years later. He
does not further specify the duration of this trip but since Polo (1901:463) refers to it
as ""una ràpida excursion"", it must have been a rather short time. For all we know this
was Polo's only visit to the Uru, at least for linguistic purposes. We do not know of
     ""Las letras kk, pp, /ƒ, son para reforzar el somdo, y distinguir asi algunas palabras "" (italics by author)
     ""[...] pueden provenir de equivocación de los indios al ser preguntados en aimarâ ""

which kind Polo's relationship to his language consultants was, but it is remarkable
that he characterises the Uru as remaining in their ""primitive state"" and points out
that the Spanish conquerers could oppress them only by work and taxes (Polo
1901:459, 460). This description shows that Polo was not only influenced by the
picture of the Uru as presented in historical sources but also by the general idea of his
time that there is a constant progression from primitive to less primitive to civilised
human communities72 (cf. Dager Alva 2000:138).
     For an evaluation of Polo's data, we have to take into consideration that Polo's
language consultants and their personal backgrounds remain unknown as does the
exact duration of Polo's apparently brief stay with the Uchumataqu speakers.
Furthermore, we do not know whether Polo needed an interpreter. Finally, his article
contains data other than his own, but it is not indicated which these are. However, the
lexical material presented by Polo is mainly congruent with that of other researchers,
although similarities are sometimes difficult to establish due to Polo's uncommon
spelling. The phrases, clauses, and verbal paradigms hardly ever agree with those of
other sources. It happens frequently that Polo reports a feature which other sources
do not mention or else a particular feature is similar in all sources except for Polo.
That is, Polo's phrases, clauses, and paradigms can be hardly verified and thus, his
grammatical material is only in part reliable.","[50, 51, 52]"
"7.2.2 Topic marker -ki
The following description of topic marker -ki is loosely based on Givón (1984).
Three main functions can be ascribed to this marker: the marking of topical
information, topic setting, and the marking of exhortative verbs. These functions will
be discussed in what follows.
     In its most basic function, the topic marker -ki marks old, i.e. topic information,
thereby being a counterpart to focus -cay. The following clauses demonstrate the
marking of topic by -ki (in bold). The speaker describes how they used to trade fish.
(15) a.     kuifaj-kifna] pitc-acu-cay ses-ki
            house-DiR     come-lN-DEC late-τορ610
            'We come to the house lately [= at night].'
       b.   qay kui-kina-k[ij   pitci-cay
            trade house-DlR-TOP come-DEC
            'We come to the trade house [= store].'                     (Vellard 1949:152)
Since the second clause is almost a repetion, the speakers marks the repeated and thus
known information kui-kina-k[i] 'to the house'by Topic marker -ki.
     As an extension, topic marker -ki can be also used to mark information that is
invoked by or can be inferred from the context but not necessarily mentioned
explicitly before. The following two clauses deal with the leave taking of Vellard and
consist of a question directed to the researcher and the answer 6 "".
(16) a.     ana tulun kun-tani okw[aJ-aki-cay
            NEG grief you-COM go-FU-DEC
            'Won't you (sg) go with grief?' (lit.: 'Won't the grief go with you?')
       b.   wali tulun-tani okw[a]-aki-cay kui-kina-kfi]
            much grief-COM go-FU-DEC            house-DlR-TOP
            'To the [my] house, I will go with much grief.' (Vellard 1949:169)
Although kuya 'house' has not been mentioned explicitly before, it can be inferred
from the context that 'going' here means: going home. As inferrable (or invoked)
information, it is marked with topic marker -ki. The constituent kui-kina-k[i] in (16b)
is right-dislocated, i.e. it appears at the end of the clause in a position normally
reserved for the verb. This is in accordance with Givón (1984:257), who notes that an
indirect complement usually expresses ""new, asserted information"". Thus, to'i("" A loan from Spanish eso 'this'. Person reference has been established in the preceding clauses

right-dislocation. It is a specific device for topicalisation and, accordingly, we find it
used with indirect complements and information that can be only inferred from or is
invoked by the context but not mentioned explicitly before.
      However, right-dislocation is a specific construction to mark what Givón calls
""topic negotiations"" (1984:257f). Topic negotiations can be understood as topic
setting elements or, as Andrews (1985:80) puts it, ""presentational"" information, i.e.
information that is entirely new to the discourse and serves to establish the
background (and is henceforth presupposed information) for the following discourse.
This topic setting information is marked by right-dislocation. The following clauses
(17a-17e) demonstrate the use of topic marker -ki as a topic setting device: it occurs
on the right-dislocated pronoun of the first clause (which is the opening clause of the
entire text) and henceforth, no person reference is expressed since it has already been
established in the first clause. Thus, although wir Τ is entirely new information, it
becomes background information for the following discourse by adding
presentational -ki. The narrator tells about how he used to go fishing.(17) a.    kuy-kani612 ok-u-cay    wir-ki

Topic setting adverbs are oftenright-dislocatedand marked with -ki, too.

    According to the documents, lekku designates a stick used to push the balsa raft. The term kaham
means a particularly large net possibly used as dragnet.

    According to Vellard, âaka- means 'ready'. However, the translation given in Muysken (2005:49) is 'to

CHAPTER 7 - CLAUSES                                                                                          273
However, some topic setting marked adverbs also occur at the beginning of a clause
(cf. 6.1). It remains uncertain whether or to which degree they are dislocated.
      A particular use of topic marker -ki is in exhortative clauses, where it is attached
to the verb instead of declarative -cay, which is prohibited (cf. 5.8.1).
( 19)          tus[a]-na          s-kepitc-ki
               balsa_ raft-LOC CL=3-retum-TOP
               'Let us return in the balsa raft! '                      (Vellard 1949:160)
This is rather striking since in most cases, it is the verb that conveys the biggest
chunk of new information. This deviation from the general pattern may be explained
by the possibilty of topic marker -ki to introduce new information in its topic setting
function. This ability may be the conceptual link to its use on verbs in exhortative
clauses.
     With respect to topic marked constituents, Givón (1984:256) explains: ""[...], the
subject [...] tends to be part of the old information in clauses, while the rest of the
clause has a higher likelihood of being new information."" Further, a direct
complement is more likely to encode topic information than an indirect complement.
In accordance with this, topic marker -ki appears mainly on subjects and direct
complements when marking old information. When it occurs in its topic setting
function (on a right-dislocated item), it appears mainly on either demonstrative
pronouns or adverbs, i.e. on constituents otherwise unlikely to be marked with -ki.
Similar to declarative -cay, no regular allomorphs of topic marker -ki exist, although
it sometimes looses its final vowel.","[288, 289, 290]"

Possessive marking -ci belongs to the nominal system of Uchumataqu and as such is
attached to nouns and numerals. As other nominal suffixes, it attaches directly to the
stem and is not followed by other morphemes except by declarative -cay or Topic
marker -ki. Possessive -ci is translated as 'have' and is found on the possessed but
refers to the possessor.

Possessive -ci is regularly used to build cardinal numbers above ten. Those numbers
are built as possessor-possessed constructions with the possessed carrying -ci (cf.4.4).

          ten-one-POS

Possessive -ci has two allomorphs, -cic (38) and -cis (39); their distribution is not
determined phonologically. All three forms are free variations, although -ci is the one
most often used.
(38)       kasfuj     watfaj-cic am-ta

           'twenty-one' (lit: 'two-ten-one-have')                (Métraux 1935:110)
The form -cic could theoretically be a combination of possessive -ci plus declarative
-cay. But since it appears in questions (38) or together with Topic marker -ki,
positions in which the use of declarative -cay is unlikely, it is considered to be a
variation of possessive -ci and not a combination of two suffixes.
     It is well possible that possessive -ci developed fom the verb cic- 'carry', as
Métraux (1935:91) points out. But even if this is the case, -ci has been completely
gramaticalised in its function as possessive marking suffix.  pataki is probably a loan from aymara pataca '[c]ien, ciento, centena' (DeLucca 1983:335)
  For double inflection with possessive -ci, cf. 3.5 3
176                        UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
As Uhle (1894:28.2, 70.2) points out, -ci shows great functional similarity to Aymara
-ni and Quechua -yog. However, Uchumataqu -ci does not mark origin like Quechua
-yoq (Cusihuaman 1976:228) and therefore is closer in meaning to Aymara -ni.","[191, 192, 193]"
"4.3.5 Adjectival states
Adjectival states (ST) form a subcategory of adjectives (cf. 3.6.2). They are derived
from verbs by application of State marking -tni or its allomorph -tin, which
themselves are built by a combination of verbal resultative -/ and nominalising
subject relativiser -ni (see 5.2.1; 5.6.1).

                 die-ST
                 'dead'                                     (Uhle 1894:103),447
(148)            lik-tni
                 drink-ST
                 'drunk'                                    (Métraux 1935:99)
However, in the majority of all cases the expression containing State Marker -tni I
-tin is lexicalised and the underlying verb form cannot be established any more. In
these cases no gloss ST is provided. Please consider examples (149) and (150).
(149)             asintin
                  'ill'                                     (Métraux 1935:100)

                  'it is bitter'                            (Vellard 1951:12)
As shown in example (150), adjectival states can take clausal marking such as
declarative -cay but otherwise they are not marked at all, i.e. they do not take
nominal or adjectival morphology. This suggests that the derivational process of
attaching -tni or -tin marks the resulting forms sufficiently as adjectives, since they
do not require predicator -kasi when used predicatively.

However, two exceptions to this claim have to be made. Example ( 152) demonstrates
the only use of predicator -kasi on an adjectival state, whereas example (153) shows
what could be analysed as the nominal plural marker -naka. Since these instances are
the only examples for these kinds of usage I regard them as exceptional.

State marking -tni and -tin are directly preceded by the verb stem. With one
exception the markers are attached only to action and action-process verbs, i.e. to
intransitive and transitive verbs alike'150. However, when attached to a transitive verb
the resulting State is always intransitive (cf. Uhle 1894:103). Please compare
example (154) to example (155) (example 148 repeated).

With respect to the allomorphs -tni and -tin the first may be regarded to be the basic
form. As mentioned above the allomorphs of the State Marker are derived from the
subject relativiser which itself has no allomorph -in but always occurs in the form of-
ni. Furthermore, -tni is used more often and it occurs mainly after consonants while
-tin preferably follows vowels. The form of -tin is built by metathesis of the basic
form. However, it is not a hard rule that -tni follows consonants while -tin occurs
after vowels but only a tendency. Please compare examples (156a, example 147
repeated) and (156b).

Similar to subject relativiser -ni the derived State Marker -tni can sometimes appear
in the form of -tni, i.e. Ini is palatalised. The following is the only example where -tin

contains a palatalised nasal. The expression appears to be lexicalised. The form
chosen for representation in the present study is either -tni or -tin.

             'fever (lit.: heat)'                           (Vellard 1951:22)
As has been mentioned above adjectival states do not take nominal or adjectival
marking and thus the question arises on which basis these forms can be termed
'adjectival'. It has been outlined in greater detail in chapter 3.6.2 that their most
important function is to modify nouns. This ability places -tni I -tin marked States
close to prototypical adjectives. Please consider examples (158) and (159).
(158)        ana matni tukun wawa
             NEG fertile woman
             'an infertile woman; a barren woman'           (Métraux 1935:90)

             'it is a warm meal'                            (Vellard 1950:81)
Apart from their functional properties the semantic content of adjectival states further
suggests that it is better to treat them as adjectives. That is, they express a state which
is so permanent or characteristic that it can be understood as a typical property of
somebody or something. A somewhat exceptional case is the expression katni
(Métraux 1935:102) or ka:tin (Vellard 1950:64) 'snow', which does not describe a
property but refers to a noun. It is the only instance where a -tni I -tin marked State is
translated as a noun. However, in all other cases adjectival states refer to properties
and physical properties are encoded as adjectives in Uchumataqu (please recall table
4.17). Therefore, it seems justified to consider adjectival states as a subcategory of
adjectives, although they are not inflected with predicator -kasi.
     In contrast to prototypical adjectives, States marked by -tni I -tin at first sight do
not seem to form an open class. What points to a possibly closed class of adjectival
states is that (with one exception) only action and action-process verbs are inflected
with State marking -tni I -tin while other semantic verb classes are not. However,
most expressions carrying -tni I -tin are lexicalised and it is impossible to establish
the underlying verb stem. This observation suggests that derivation of adjectival
states by means of applying -tni I -tin was not productive any more at the time of
documentation, which may further explain the relatively small number of actual
instances found and repeated citations of the same form. Thus, I would like to ascribe
the small set of items and the restricted applicability of -tni I -tin to a lexicalisation
process completed before the first documentation rather than to adjectival states
forming a closed class.","[222, 223, 224]"
"3.5.2 Adjectival and adverbial reduplication
In most cases, adjectives reduplicate only their initial syllable and reduplication of
the entire stem (or root) is exceptional.
(54)      cu-cuni
          RED-good
          'very good'                                   (Vellard 1951:10)
(55)      ana    cu-cuni
          NEG RED-good
          'disgusting'                                  (Polo 1901:470)
Example (56) shows the reduplication of the entire (admittedly monosyllabic)
adjectival stem.
(56)      ca-ca-cay
          old-old-DEC
          'very old man'                                (Vellard 1950:60)
The function of adjectival reduplication is always augmentative regardless of whether
there is partial or, less common complete reduplication.
     There is only one instance of adverbial reduplication present in the sources. It is
lexicalised; no basic, non-reduplicated form can be found. Example (57)
demonstrates this instance, with the entire stem reduplicated.
(57)      loaloa
          'quickly'                                     (Métraux 1935:110)3.5.3 Nominal and pronominal reduplication
Nouns and pronouns show the broadest range of reduplication types and functions.
Particularly nouns can reduplicate their initial or final syllable or the enire stem, and
functions most commonly expressed are either augmentative or plurality. The latter
can be expressed only in case the entire nominal stem is reduplicated. This may be
due to the fact that partial reduplication is insufficient in conveying the idea of
plurality and instead, the entire stem must be reduplicated. There are no such
constraints with an augmentative function, which can occur with partial and complete
nominal reduplication. The following examples show the types of reduplication and
functions found with nouns and pronouns.
     Examples (58) and (59) demonstrate the reduplication of initial and final
syllables. For none of the items basic, non-reduplicated forms can be established and
thus, the impact of reduplication cannot be established.

The following is the only instance where an initial consonant cluster is reduplicated.
As in the preceding two examples, the function of reduplication is unknown and the
term is possibly lexicalised.

augmentative function. The same meaning is expressed in example (62) with the
entire stem reduplicated.

              'little girl (less than three years)'                 (Vellard 1950:60)
Example (63) shows the augmentative function of pronominal reduplication.

It is only with pronouns that a possible distributive function may be expressed, as in
(64) and (65). There are only a few instances.

As mentioned above, plurality is conveyed only in case the entire stem is
reduplicated as shown in the following example.

Names of astronomical constellations can be regarded as lexicalised In cases such as
these, reduplication has the function of expressing plurality

A similar situation is found with animal names, which are often built by reduplication
of either the initial syllable or the entire stem As with astronomical phenomena, we
may consider them lexicalised
(69)          kusi-kusi-cay
              'it is a spider'                                           (Vellard 1950 87)

In some cases, reduplication serves an onomatopoetic effect
(71)          ko ko ro ko™
              'rooster'                                                  (Lehmann 1929d 8)

Another special case is the reduplication of grammatical material It affects nouns,
adjectives, and numerals and occurs only with possessive marking -ci It is unlikely
that reduplication of possessive -ci is lexicalised since every word bearing
reduplicated -ci has a basic, non-reduplicated form Furthermore, reduplication of -ci
is exceptional since in the majority of all cases, the marker is not reduplicated Thus,
the function of this reduplication type is not entirely clear but it is possible that it
denotes a very close and possibly inalienable kind of possession If this assumption is
true, reduplication of -ci could be considered to be augmentative in function
Consider the following examples
(73)          kurs-ci-ci
              tail-POS-POS
              'rabbit (ht tail-having)'                                   (Lehmann 1929d 5)

      This onomatopoetic expression is probably a borrowingfromSpanish
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                  149
Reduplication of possessive -ci is not restricted to body parts but can also occur with
adjectives describing characteristics and numerals
(75)     tuk[i]-ci-ci
          old-pos-pos
          'grandfather (ht old / age-having)'                    (Polo 1901 464)

         'thirteen'                                    (Vellard 1951 18)
The interpretation of reduplicated -ci as marking a very close relation is further
supported by its use on numerals (cf 4 4) Vellard (1951 17ff) reports the
reduplication to appear on every numeral higher than ten (cf example 76)
In conclusion, I would like to state that reduplication must have been a fairly
productive means of stem modification once, but lexicalisation has often obscured its
meaning This is particularly the case with verbs However, with adjectives, nouns,
and pronouns some regularities can be detected Adjectives mainly reduplicate their
initial syllable and due to their semantics convey only an augmentative meaning,
whereas nouns and pronouns show partial or complete reduplication In contrast to
adjectives, nominal reduplication can have the function of plurality but only with
complete reduplication3 6 Parts of speech
According to Payne (1997 32, bold marking by the author), ""grammatical
categories are called 'parts of speech'"" or are sometimes also referred to as ""lexical
categones"" The lexical content of an Uchumataqu word is sometimes hard to grasp
due to diverging or even missing translations Therefore, I will classify Uchumataqu
categones primarily on the basis of their structural and functional properties, ι e
according to their morphosynatctic behaviour Pursuing this approach the following
parts of speech can be established nouns, adjectives, and verbs Two somewhat
special cases are particles and so-called phrases, ι e fixed expressions found in
everyday life's communication Particles do not form a word class of their own but
do not belong to another word class either Phrases, even less than particles, do not
form a grammatical category but will be treated here as a final remark on
Uchumataqu parts of speech They differ syntactically from prototypical noun or verb
phrases and clause types and thus will not be considered in chapter 7
      Although it is well possible to establish three grammatical categories the
boundanes between them are not always clear-cut (cf Schachter 1985 6, Payne
1997 32) These overlaps are observed for other languages too and go as far as to
bring into question the traditional distinction between the different categories (cf
Croft 2003 183)
      In what follows, I will use the terms 'grammatical category' and 'parts of
speech' alike to refer to the Uchumataqu categones Further, I would like to point out
that for the subsequent outline of the classification of Uchumataqu parts of speech, I
roughly follow Schachter (1985) and Payne (1997)
150                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
3.6.1 Nouns
Notions most typically associated with nouns are time-stability (Payne 1997:33) and
referentiality (Croft 2003:185) to ""persons, places, and things"" (Schachter 1985:7),
the latter concepts considered to be prototypically encoded by nouns.
Payne (1997:33)3'5 lists as functional properties of nouns their ability to act as the
head of noun phrases, to serve as either subject or object of a clause, and to be most
commonly the topic of texts. The head of a noun phrase can be characterised as ""the
one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers
to"" (Payne 1997:33) (cf. 77).
(77)       co:k lu.si
           big    jar
           'abigjar'                                              (Métraux 1935:94)
Example (77) is about ajar, not about co.k 'big', which only specifies the type of jar.
That is, the phrase itself refers to lu.si 'jar', but not to co.k and therefore, lu.si is the
head of the phrase.
     Another function of nouns is as predicates and as such, no particular marking or
copulative device is required. Please consider (78).

           adobebrick house-DEC

                                                       (Vellard 1967:7)
The role of a predicate is usually reserved for verbs. When nouns are used as
predicates without particular marking, the distinction between nouns and verbs
becomes blurred316.
      Despite this overlap between verbs and nouns, the latter can be set apart by their
ability to function as the subject of a clause (examples 78 and 79).
(79)        hep-[p]im-s          kuyla manti-cay311
            father-AFF-CL=3 house rule-DEC
            'The father rules [in] the house.'                    (Vellard 1951:35)
The noun hep 'father' is the subject of example (79), whereas kuyla 'house' serves as
object. Thus, these findings are in accordance with Payne's definition. However, with
regard to the role of objects we find an overlap with verbs since verbs can likewise
function as arguments, i.e. objects. These cases will be further discussed in 3.6.3.
     The third functional property of nouns mentioned by Payne is their potential to
be the topics of texts, as demonstrated in example (80a) and (80b). As such, they are
often marked by topic marker -ki (bold).","[163, 164, 165, 166, 167]"
"5.6.2 Action nominaliser -s
The form -i belongs to the verbal suffixes that mark nominalisation and forms a
complement to the matrix verb. The morpheme -s marks an action nominaliser (AN),
i.e. an unspecified nominalisation, similar to Quechua -y. Therefore, I propose a
translation as either '(the) ...-ing' or else with the infinitive form, as e.g. 'to go'.
Action nominaliser -s is attached to the verb stem without preceding suffixes, but can
be occasionally followed by the clausal clitics topic -ki (85) or declarative -cay.

          'Now, I want to give money.' (lit: 'Now, I want the money-giving.')
                                                      (Uhle 1894:94.2)

          'Far [away] there is fishing.'               (Vellard 1949:152)
In the following example action nominaliser -s is followed by terminative -kama
(86). However, in most cases it is not followed by case markers.
(86)      wist keppi-s-kama
          my retum-AN-TER
          'Until my return.'                             (Vellard 1967:31)
In some cases, an interpretation as AN -s(i) may be questioned. However, I propose
that the following example also represents an instance of action nominaliser -s(i).
(87)      am-tani ok-[s]i         pek-u-cay      ana-l

The marker s appears regularly in elicitation lists when the infinitive form is given.
By a comparison with the form of first person singular, it is possible to state whether
s marks the infinitive or else belongs to the verb stem (as it the case for e.g. liks- 'to
drink').

As pointed out by Uhle (1894:105), action nominaliser -s is apparently lexicalised on
some instrument names, as e.g. on potsi 'knife' (Métraux 1935:94) or thaxsi 'bed'
(Uhle 1894:105; cf. 89).
(89)        wiyanis waxe521            uxk-cay tfajxfsje

            'At night, we go to bed immediately.'
            ('es la noche, en seguida vamos (a) dormir') (Vellard 1967:1)
The forms -si and -s are allomorphs of action nominaliser -s, but occur in a few cases
only, and particularly -si appears mainly on instrument names although it is not
limited to them (cf. 90). The forms -s, -si and -s occur in free alternation, although -s
is the most common one. It the furthermore the form chosen for representation (cf.
2.14.3).

            'It is good to rest still; rest.'                          (Vellard 1949:169)
Action Nominaliser -s has no restrictions with respect to verb class and is not
restricted in its temporal scope, either.
      Although only a limited database of entire clauses is available for action
nominaliser -s, the data suggest that person is mostly indicated by the use of either
subjects or subject pronouns. However, there are also cases in which person is not
marked at all (cf. 90). In these cases, we may assume that the context supports
understanding.
      It is in Uhle's data (1894) that the combination -s{-)ni occurs. An interpretation
as action nominaliser plus subject relativiser is impossible since the action
nominaliser itself is a nominalising suffix and therefore cannot be followed by
another nominalising, i.e. verbal suffix. However, the clauses are not entirely clear
and in most cases a different interpretation is possible as well.

236                        UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Uhle (ibid) interprets yanapisni asyanapi- 'to help' plus what he calls infinitive -sni.
I propose a different interpretation: Both yana- 'serve' and Additional -pis 'also;
too'525 come from Quechua (Lira 1944:1178, Cusihuamân 1976:249ff) and do not
constitute the verb yanapa- 'to help' but rather they are two distinct morphemes. In
(91), the Uchumataqu subject relativiser -ni follows. However, the expectation is that
a clausal element such as Additional -pis would appear at the end of the construction,
i.e. after the nominaliser but not before it. No explanation can be provided for this but
it is likewise improbable that either a nominalising suffix should be followed by
another or that the Uchumataqu action nominaliser should be *-sni instead of -s.","[251, 252, 253]"
"3.1 Roots, stems, and words
Before describing the morphological entities of Uchumataqu, I would like to point to
a somewhat inconsistent use of terminology in the literature. Thus, particularly the
terms 'root' and 'stem' are often used in contradictory ways and what is defined as
'root' in one study describes a 'stem' in another one. I will adopt a definition for the
terms 'root' and 'stem' that is not bound to a certain theory, as provided by Payne
(1997:24). According to this author, a root can be defined as ""an unanalyzable form
that expresses the basic lexical content of the word,"", while stem can be described as
""consist[ing] minimally of a root, but may be analyzable into a root plus derivational
morphemes. [...] Like a root, a stem may or may not be a fully understandable
word."". Example (1) presents some roots of Uchumataqu.
(1)       un-                   'to give, lend'                  (Polo 1901:478)

The following items may be analysed as Uchumataqu stems.
(2)       yuxki okni            'guide'                          (Lehmann 1929b:7)
          cerini                ' looked at, upon '              (Uhle 1894:71 )
The expression yuxki okni 'guide' is a compound that consists of the directional
adverb yuxki 'in front of and the verb ok- 'to go', which is nominalised by the
subject relativiser -ni. The construction can literally be translated as 'the one who
goes ahead'. The component okni, literally 'goer', is interpreted as a stem. The
second example cerini 'looked at, upon' can be analysed as consisting of the verb
cer- 'to see' and an adjectival state marker -ini. The application of the marker -mi
turns the verb into an adjectival state (cf. 3.6.2 and 4.3.5). It has to be noted that the
instances in (2) are exceptional since in many cases the difference between roots and
stems is not visible in Uchumataqu. For example, the expression sisni 'sorcerer'
(example mine) can be analysed as being composed of the verbal root sis- 'to know'
and the subject relativiser -ni, meaning 'the one who knows'. In this case, sisni can
be analysed as a stem. It can also be interpreted as the lexicalised expression
'sorcerer', in which case it would be a root. Since the degree of lexicalisation of a
particular term often remains uncertain, I will prefer the term 'stem' over 'root'.275
     With respect to the number of syllables in stems (cf. 2.13.1), we find that
nominal and adjectival stems can have up to three syllables. Forms consisting of four
  I owe thanks to Simon van de Kerke for his useful comments on this topic.
130                        UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
syllables are the result of compounding and lexicalisation processes, as e.g. in
pikiltani 'the two together', where the Numeral pisk 'two' is combined with
comitative Marker -stani and linking element -il. However, on the average, adverbs
tend to have either one or two syllables. If an adverb comprises three syllables, this is
likewise the result of a lexicalisation process, as in wirwina 'last' (Vellard 1951:19),
which is composed of win 'back; anus' and an unanalysable element -wina. Verbal
stems are likewise limited to a maximum of two syllables. However, since verbs are
almost always inflected with morphological markers, the final stem vowel is often
deleted during this process and thus, verbs often appear to be monosyllabic, although
the stem is actually bisyllabic. Only in a few cases the final stem vowel is maintained
during inflection, as can be seen in examples (3) and (4) (final stem vowel bold).
(3)       ceri-s-n-a-cay
          see-su-OB2-FU-DEC
          'I will see it.'                              (Vellard 1949:168)
(4)       pica-x
          come-JU
          '(S)he shall come!'                           (Uhle 1894:92.2)
The elision of the final stem vowel caused by inflection often makes it necessary to
reconstruct it.
     Only in interrogative and subordinate clauses, as well as in chain verb
constructions do verbs appear in the shape of their stem (see also sections 5.7.3, 7.6,
and 7.8.2). Nominal stems, on the other hand, can occur without marking, as is
frequently the case with subjects and direct objects, which are only optionally marked
by topic marker -ki. The same situation is found with adjectival and adverbial stems,
particularly in attributive function, where they are often zero marked (cf. 3.2).
     However, both verbal and nominal stems form the basis for further inflectional
and derivational processes, as shown in the following examples (stems bold).
(5)       hisk-n-u-cay
          afraid-OB2-lSG-DEC
          'it frightens me'                             (Vellard 1949:166)

          sleep-AN
          'bed (lit.: 'that which is for sleeping')'    (Métraux 1935:100)
Adjectival and adverbial stems take nominal morphological markers as well, but can
also be inflected with adjectival predicator -kasi (cf. 4.3.3 and 6.1.6).
(8)        sies-kfisjtani
          yesterday-SEP
          'since yesterday'                             (Uhle 1894:23,49)

(9)       yafsij-kasi

          'it is now'                                  (Vellard 1949:162)
Before turning to the average number of affixes per morpheme and the related
question of the tyological profile of the language, I will discuss the basis on which
the items quoted in (5) to (9) can be termed 'words'. That is, how is it possible to say
that e.g. yafsij-kasi (example 9) is construed of one single word and not of two, such
as *ya[si]ka si. As the discussion of phonology (chapter 2) has shown, phonological
criteria are a less reliable means for establishing word boundaries and thus, I will
adopt a syntactic definition of the term 'word', as provided by Anderson (1985:153):
""The units which can thus be permuted or interrupted freely by other 'words' can
therefore be taken to establish a syntactic notion of ""word."". Examples (10) and (11)
present such cases.
(10)      wala-kfij       aski-cay   iyai
          village-TOP far-DEC         more
          'The village is further away.'               (Métraux 1935:100)
(11)      wata iya-cay aski-n
          village more-DEC far-?
          'The village is further away.'               (Métraux 1935:104)
Sentences such as (10) and (11) establish wata, iya, and aski as discrete lexical items,
whereas no similar case involving -kasi can be found. Thus, e.g. iya can be
established as a word, while -kasi cannot. Once word boundaries are established, they
can be further supported by morphological and even phonological evidence, such as
that e.g. declarative -cay is always word final, and that words do not begin with /r/.","[146, 147, 148]"
"1.3.1 The names Uru and Uchumataqu
Several names have been applied to the Uru and their language during the last 500
years. In what follows, I will give a brief overview of the names applied and will
discuss the denomination chosen for the current work. The list of sources quoted in
the following is by no means exhaustive but represents only a part.
      In colonial sources we find the name Uro to be the most common one when
referring to the people12. Both Alonso Ramos Gavilân (Historia del santuario de
Nuestra Senora de Copacabana, [1621] 1988:82) and Antonio de Castro y del
Castillo (Juicio de Limites entre el Peru y Bolivia, [1651] 1906:201) also give the
name Ochosuma, and Gavilân specifies that this was the common appellation of the
ethnic group. The origin and meaning of this name is entirely uncertain and we do
not even know whether it was a self-denomination of the Uru people or a name given
to them by their neighbours. With respect to the language, most chroniclers do not
provide a name but only say that the Uru had their own language, which was
different from all others. However, Mercado de Penalosa ([1586] 1965:336) and
Balthasar Ramirez ([1597] 1936:48) state that the Uru language was called Pukina.
      According to Espinoza Soriano ([1575-77] 1981:195, translation mine), Uru and
Uruquilla were denominations of two different ethnic groups: ""The Uros in this
empire are less numerous than the Aymaras, Uruquillas and Sevaroyos.""13. This
opinion is not shared by Weston LaBarre (1941:500), who states: ""The Uroquillas of
the early chroniclers appears to have meant the Uru; [...]•""· Espinoza Soriano's
observation is likewise rejected by Torero. Following Torero (2002:468), Uruquilla
refered to the language family Uru-Chipaya, while the name Uro (or Ochosuma)
meant only the people with a water-based economy. In the process of aymaricisation,
the term Uruquilla was lost and the appellation Uru, formerly restricted to the people,
became generalised to refer to the speakers and their language. In the light of what
has been said by Espinoza Soriano, LaBarre's and Torero's statements may be
questioned, although the discussion about Uru and Uruquilla continues.",[29]

There is an allomorph to the instrumental marking function of -stani which is -na. It
is strictly limited to instrumental marking (INS) and therefore is not attached to
animate nouns. It is to note that non-animate nouns can be inflected with -stani and
-na alike, e.g. kucillom 'knife' (50, 57) or qhasi 'water', although there is a tendency
to inflect 'real' instruments like knives, stones, or sticks with -na rather than -stani.

Table 4.9: Distribution oi-stan(i),   -tan(i), and -na according to nominal semantic categories4.1.4 Plural markers -naka and -wici
Number in Uchumataqu is not marked obligatorily, but the language offers several
possibilities to express plurality, one of which is by suffixing plural marker -naka.
Furthermore, numerals, quantifiers, and sometimes personal pronouns are employed
to express plural. The several means do not exclude each other although they are
almost never used together. Uchumataqu has no dual or further subdivision of plural.
      The Nominal plural marker -naka is a loan from Aymara, where it marks
plurality on nouns and personal pronouns. In Aymara plural marking is not obligatory
and the absence of the plural marker -naka does not necessarily indicate singularity.
Furthermore, -naka does not occur with numerals or quantifiers that modify the noun.
      In Uchumataqu the plural marker -naka, as in Aymara, is found on nouns, and
personal and interrogative pronouns to express plurality (cf. examples 60, 61, 64, 65).
It can be followed by Topic marker -ki, declarative -cay, and case marking suffixes.
Plural -naka may also be preceded by other morphemes such as subject relativiser
-ni, but in most cases -naka is neither preceded nor followed by other morphemes.

As in Aymara, plural -naka in Uchumataqu is not obligatory, particularly if there is a
numeral or quantifier, which modifies the noun.

With regard to personal pronouns plural -naka attaches to the pronouns of first and
third person singular to form the regular plural forms of 'we' and 'they' (cf. 4.2.1).
Its use here has to be considered highly lexicalised.

It is on the pronoun of first person plural that we find an element -t(i) which attaches
to plural -naka. When this happens, -naka looses its final vowel. Meaning and
function of -t(i) cannot be explained, and it is possible that -nakt(i) is only an
alternative form to -naka196.

Some of the earlier sources on Uchumataqu (Polo 1901, Lehmann 1929, Métraux
1935) mention the use of an older pronominal plural marker -wic(i). It is used only on
third person singular ni '(s)he' to form niwici 'they' and is not found on other
pronouns or nouns. That it has been gradually replaced by Aymara -naka is reflected
in the parallel use of -wici and -naka in the sources mentioned above (cf. examples
65, 69, 70). In later sources (Vellard 1949-67, Muysken 2005) -wici cannot be found.

    This is a loan from Aymara

Except for the loss of final /a/ before -t(i) no special phonological processes can be

Table 4 10 Distribution of-naka, -nakt(i), and -wici4 2 Pronouns
Pronouns either accompany nouns or are substitutions to them and as such normally
have all the morphosyntactic properties of nouns Uchumataqu has five sets of
pronouns which are personal, possessive, demonstrative, indefinite, and interrogative
pronouns They all can take nominal morphological markers (although it depends on
their semantics which these are) and therefore, pronouns form a subcategory of the
nominal system in Uchumataqu4 21 Personal Pronouns
Uchumataqu has the following personal pronouns
(71)      wir     'Γ                ucumi        'we (incl)'
          am      'you'             msnaka       'we (excl)'
          m       'he, she, it'     amcuka       'you (all)'
                                    ninaka       'they'
Due to the heterogenous nature of the sources on Uchumataqu the information about
personal prounouns is quite vaned The variation does not only appear between two
documents but also within one single source Therefore, I decided to take as the
pronoun represented here, the form that in all or most documents appears as the most
general form of a given pronoun However, the pronouns of first person singular, first
person plural inclusive and exclusive as well as third person plural require a more
detailed explanation
     With regard to first person singular we find a variety of spellings ranging from
wex over wir to wis Uhle (1894 98, translation mine) points to this irregularity by
184                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
noting: ""[...] as in general a pronounciation of hi dominates which for a German ear
is more reminiscent of /s/ than hi [,..].""397. Recordings made recently by Muysken
(2001) as well as audio data on modem Chipaya confirm that first person singular
pronoun could be represented as w'A, i.e. with a lateral fricative. As indicated by
Uhle, this particular sound was not easily recognisable, which may explain why in
certain environments we find wir, whereas in other contexts wis (or wex) is
employed. In its basic form and together with a linking vowel I'll wir is used, but
when case suffixes are attached (e.g. COM -stani) assimilation occurs and the pronoun
of first person singular is pronounced wis. Since the basic form of first person
singular is wir I will choose this form for representation here398.
     There are two forms combined with or related to first person plural inclusive
ucumi. One is wakpaca 'all' (see also further below) which can serve as a modifier
for ucumi. When this happens, a phonological process takes place which leads to a
syncope of wakpaca and the personal pronoun of first person plural inclusive ucumi.
There, final /a/ of wakpaca is deleted and by processes of elision and assimilation the
form wakpa-cumi results, which is translated as 'we all'399.
(72)        wak 'pa cumi kepic-aki-cay ni            wat 'kfaj-kina 00
            all      we     retum-FU-DEC that        village-DiR
            ""We all will come back to this village.'                 (Vellard 1949:152)
The second form related to ucumi is cuki which expresses an exhortative first person
plural inclusive401 (cf. Vellard 1967:33) and is best translated as 'let us'.
(73)        ni-s        skit'ti   cuki huk
            that-CL=3 clothes let_us bum
            'Let's bum these clothes.'402                                       (Vellard 1949:167)
The pronoun of first person plural exclusive is wisnaka which is composed of a
combination of first person singular w 4 0 3 and plural marker -naka (cf. 4.1.4). We
find a similar situation with third person plural ninaka, which is constructed in a
parallel way to wisnaka404. There is, however, an older pronominal plural marker397
    ""[...] wie ja überhaupl hier eine Aussprache des r überwiegt, welche für ein deutsches Ohr mehr an § als
an r anklingt [...].""
398
    With that, I am in accordance with Uhle (1894), Lehmann (Ancoaqui, 1929), Métraux (1935), and
Vellard ( 1951, 1967) who all have wir as one form of first person singular
399
    Since first person plural inclusive ucumi also functions as possessive pronoun, in some cases a
translation as 'all our' is appropriate, too.
400
    In the examples (72) and (73) ni marks a demonstrative rather than a personal pronoun (cf. 4 2 1).
401
    Uhle (1894) reports a form cuk(i) as well but treats it as a form of second person plural Although
Métraux translates cuki as a first person plural, he, too, gives one translation as second person plural
(1935:90). All other documents translate cuki as an instance of first person plural.
402
    Here, a translation as 'his clothes' would also be possible The translation offered here is based on
Vellard (ibid).
403
    Although here, final M has eventually turned into a sibilant.
404
    It might be possible that Uchumataqu originally had a 4-person-system consisting of wir, am, m, and
ucumi. The forms wisnaka and ninaka were added as a reaction to the language pressure exercised by
Aymara and Quechua The fact that the forms of wakpaca and cuki are related only to first person plural
inclusive ucumi but not to wisnaka supports that view. However, for lack of data this proposition will not
be further pursued

The pronouns of first to third person singular very often take a clitic element which,
in the case of first and second person singular, needs a linking vowel /i/ in order to be
attached to the pronoun (cf. 7.3).

             [('Ich will ihm das nicht geben.'l do not want to give it to him.)
However, all personal pronouns can take all nominal suffixes except for locative
markers -kis and -ksi (cf. Uhle 1894:41) and possessive -ci. They also take clausal
clitics such as declarative -cay. Topic marker -ki, as well as QM -ta.
      As a final remark, the form wakpaca 'all' will be discussed. It is not a personal
pronoun in a strict sense, but will be treated here due to its relation to the personal
pronoun of first person plural inclusive. The form wakpaca is a compound of Aymara
wake 'part, portion; price'405 (DeLucca 1983:444) and the suffix -paca which
DeLucca (1983:328) describes as following: ""It resembles the expression 'and all',
which in colloquial Spanish is used to emphasise the idea of 'a whole number'""406.
Since wakpaca itself is not used in Aymara we may regard it as the genuine Uru
expression. From Vellard 1949 onwards we find a parallel use of wakpaca and wake
or waki, the latter one being a recent loan from Aymara (76).
(76)        kuka wak'i ti-cay
            coca all       this-DEC

            ('kuka wak'i-ticay)                              (Vellard 1951:34)
The form wakpaca does not only modify the pronoun of first person plural inclusive
but also refers to nouns (77). This sets wakpaca apart from the personal pronouns:
(77)        wakpac'a        paku-cay
            all             dog-DEC
            'all dogs'                                                   (Vellard 1967:21)405

(translation mine)
186                      U C H U M A T A Q U : THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
However, apart from its modifying function, wakpaca can also occupy a prototypical
pronominal position (78).
(78)      waqpaca-l wir-i-l            ta-cay
          all-CL=l      I-LV-CL=1      give-DEC

Similar to personal pronouns, wakpaca can take nominal markers (79) as well as
personal (78) and clausal clitics, although inflection with nominal morphology is
exceptional.

          ('wak 'pak 'sta kinsi (ila (ila sç 'k'-cay haske haske') (Vellard 1949:163)
When wakpaca is used, plural marker -naka becomes superfluous (76) and is used
only exceptionally. We may assume that the use of wakpaca together with plural
marker -naka emphasises the idea of plurality.","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203]"
"1.1.2 Uchumataqu compared with Chipaya
Chipaya is the only member of the Uru-Chipaya4 linguistic family that is still in use
today. It has approximately 1,800 native speakers in the communitiy Santa Ana de
Chipaya near Lake Coipasa in southwest Bolivia. Chipaya is highly endangered due
to an increasing influence of Spanish in modem Bolivian society and a shift to
Aymara. Uchumataqu and Chipaya are considered to be as closely related as French
4
   In 2001 the Nacwn Originaria Um (NOU) was formed in Oraro and consists of several groups, who
consider themselves to be of Uru origin. However, none of them speaks a Uru-Chipaya language any
more, with the exception of the Chipaya.
6                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
and Spanish (Muysken 2001:77), although the exact kind and degree of their
relationship still has to be explored.
      It has become common usage to refer to the variety of the Titicaca region as
Uru, whereas Chipaya denotes the variety spoken in southwest Bolivia close to Lake
Coipasa. For further discussion of the denominations Uru and Uchumataqu, cf. 1.3.1.
      Both varieties are structurally close to each other and with respect to phonology,
we may say that Uchumataqu and Chipaya are almost identical (at least from what
can be judged from the phonological information on Uchumataqu given in the
sources). However, with regard to morphology, Uchumataqu has certain morphemes
that do not occur in Chipaya, either because Uchumataqu preserved an older stage of
the language due to its isolation or, alternatively, Uchumataqu developed these
morphemes after its split from other Uru-Chipaya. These morphemes, then, are
unique to Uchumataqu. Among these unique morphemes are possibly the personal
pronoun of second person singular kun 'you', which appears to be restricted to
interrogative clauses. Another pronominal form is -wici, which can be described as
an original pronominal plural marker that was used to build niwici 'they' before
Aymara plural marker -naka took on this function. Morphemes that probably
developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya speaking groups had lost contact are
predicator -kasi, question bound topic marker -xwi, and In-Group marker -acu. The
non-existence of predicator -kasi in Chipaya relates to another difference: in
Uchumataqu, predicator -kasi distinguishes adjectives as a separate word class, while
in Chipaya adjectives form a subcategory of nouns (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:103) but
do not constitute a class of its own5. Uchumataqu resultative -/ resembles Aymara
resultative marker -ta to some degree and Chipaya seems to have borrowed the
Aymara marker. Thus, Uchumataqu -/ and Chipaya -ta are not entirely different but
contrast, just like Uchumataqu -t and the Aymara morpheme. It is possible that
Uchumataqu -t derives from the Aymara form and would be therefore a morpheme
that developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya had become separated.
      One of the more crucial differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is the
locative marking system. As will be further outlined under 4.1.1.2 and 4.1.1.3,
Uchumataqu has two basic locative forms, which are -kis and -fa/, each of which has
an allomorph derived by metathesis: -kis I -ski and -fa/' / -sikf. The form -kis I -ski is
the directional locative, which marks a movement 'into X' with motion verbs, while
with stative or position verbs it is translated as 'in X'. The form -fa/' / -siki expresses
a locative and is always understood as 'in X'. I analyse this as a system in transition
(cf. 4.1.1). Chipaya also has two locative markers -kiz(i) and -kin(a), which do not
possess metathesised allomorphs. The form -kiz(i) refers to entities or objects being
close to the speaker, while -kin(a) marks entities or objects being away from the
!
   Chipaya preserves lexicalisations with -Un, a form that in Uchumataqu serves to create adjectival states,
which form a subcategory of adjectives In Uchumataqu, -/in was still productive at the time of
documentation, but lexicahsed forms with -Im exist too (for further discussion, cf 4 3 5) In Chipaya, it is
doubtful whether the form -tin is still productive Cerrón-Palomino (2006) does not interpret it as a
morpheme
   It has to be noted that the interpretation of-ski and -siki as allomorphs is arguable It may possible that
both forms represent one morpheme and -ski is the same as -siki only with an unstressed -si
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                                7
speaker (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:128). Uchumataqu, too, uses a form -kina but it is
purely directional. Thus, the two systems are rather different. When I asked a native
speaker of Chipaya to translate the Uchumataqu expression wat-siki 'in the village'
(Uhle 1894:19), he understood it as 'the weave (el tejido)', thus analysing wat- as the
verb stem 'to weave', -s possibly as the action nominaliser followed by a linking
vowel -/', and topic marker -kf.
      Another case of formally similar but functionally different suffixes are Chipaya
-z and Uchumataqu -s. Chipaya -z is analysed by Cerrón-Palomino (2006:159, 160)
as 'reflexivo-mediopasivo', while for Uchumataqu -s I propose an interpretation as
first person singular subject marker. Even if possible interpretation errors are left
aside, the fact remains that both suffixes appear in the same slot, are preceded and
followed by the same types of morphemes, and they even have similar allomorphs,
namely -zh in Chipaya and -s in Uchumataqu. Nonetheless, they cannot express the
same idea since Chipaya -z is not restricted to a particular person, whereas
Uchumataqu -s marks a first person singular as subject. Thus, formally they are
almost identical but differ considerably with respect to function.
      One of the greatest differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is that the
latter has a gender distinction, which Uchumataqu entirely lacks. The Chipaya gender
distinction affects nouns, pronouns, and the personal clitics, although there is a
growing tendency to neglect the use of female pronouns, particularly with respect to
the plural form nanaka 'they (fern.)'. This may be due to a growing Spanish
influence on Chipaya, since in Spanish a group of men and women is referred to as
ellos 'they (masc.)'. Only if there is a group composed solely of women would the
female form ellas 'they (fern.)' be used. A similar use of ninaka 'they (masc.)' and
nanaka 'they (fern.)' can be observed in Chipaya8.
      It is possible that some of the morphemes described as characteristic only for
Chipaya existed in Uchumataqu before it became highly endangered. Alternatively, it
is possible that they existed even at the time of documentation, but went unnoticed
because documentation would have required a long-term study of a wider range of
data including conversations between native speakers, story telling, etc. However,
given the high number of different morphemes or formally similar but functionally
different affixes, it seems doubtful that intelligibility between speakers of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya has ever been very high, despite Wachtel's observation
(1990:269) that during a recent meeting of Uchumataqu and Chipaya speakers both
groups could talk to each in ""Uru-Chipaya"". During field-work carried out in January
2006, I asked several native speakers of Chipaya to translate phrases and simple
clauses from Uchumataqu and the outcome was very different. In some cases, there
was hardly any or no understanding at all, while in other cases there was a certain
degree of intelligibility. However, the fact that some Uchumataqu phrases from Uhle
   The interpretation and transcription of these morphemes in Chipaya provided by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006) is slightly different: what I termed action nominaliser -s is labelled the ""infinitivizador"" -z(a)
(Cerrón-Palomino 2006 131), while what I analyse as a linking vowel -ι is termed by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006.87) as ""inflexion vocalica"" The interpretation of-Ai as topic marker is the same for Uchumataqu (cf.
7 2 2) and Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino 2006 175).

and Métraux could be interpreted by Chipaya speakers does not prove immediate
intelligibility since a French native speaker would probably understand the basic
meaning of a written Spanish text, even without knowledge of Spanish but that would
be probably quite different if (s)he were confronted with rapid, spoken Spanish. This
was actually the case when during field-work I asked the Chipaya native speakers to
listen to the Uchumataqu passages in Vellard's film: none of them could immediately
understand what has been said and it was only after several sessions that they had
gained a general idea of the Uchumataqu texts. That is, it has probably been possible
for an Uchumataqu native speaker to understand whether a Chipaya speaker talked
about his / her family, fanning, or the latest transactions made in La Paz, but details
may remain obscure.","[22, 23, 24, 25]"

      Although the number of expected participants is clearly at least one

      The element -m cannot be explained.

In principle, causative -sna can occur with every verb class but there are restrictions
with respect to its allomorph -ska (see below). The form -sna appears with
(transitive) cognition and utterance verbs (73) as well as with (intransitive) states
(74), thereby turning them into transitive verbs.
(73)        cis-         'to speak'
            ci[s]-sna    'to cause someone to speak = to teach someone'5""
                                                                (Métraux 1935:103,96)
(74)        cipi-cay     'filli'512
            cip-sna-     'to fill something'
            {'cipcnâca')                                        (Uhle 1894:102)
The allomorph -ska occurs with (transitive) action and action-process verbs.
(75)        Iowa Iowa cap      capi-sk[a]-a
            quick      spear spear-CAU-lMP
            'Quickly, make [someone] spear it! '
            impronto ensartale (unpez con un chuzo depescay)(Ve\\ard 1967:1)
Even less evidence is available for the form -ska and therefore it is likewise uncertain
whether it marks a causative or whether it is a regular morpheme at all. However, if
the form -ska is an allomorph of causative -sna, there is a pattern of distribution
according to verb class (see above). Remarkably, the forms are apparently not
distributed according to transitivity, with e.g. one form attached only to intransitive
verbs and the other reserved for transitive ones. No hard and firm conclusions can be
drawn but it is possible that the notion of control may be of importance here (cf.
Payne 1997, referring to Haiman 1983)513. If this is true, causative -sna and its
allomorph -ska may indicate different degrees of control the causée exercises upon
the action. Then the form -sna marks a low degree of control on the causee's side
since one cannot choose what (s)he sees nor can e.g. a pot decide whether it is filled
or not. Similarly, the allomorph -ska, occuring with action and action-process verbs,
expresses that the causée exercises a higher degree of control since one can decide (at
least in theory) whether one wants to spear a fish or not. Therefore, one expects the
allomorph -ska to appear only with animate nouns.
      As can be seen from the examples, causative -sna is attached directly to the verb
stem. In most cases, it is not followed by other morphemes although it can be
followed by imperative -a and clausal clitics as declarative -cay or topic marker
-λ/514.
      From this, one would expect to find clear indication of person reference but in
fact most clauses do not contain person reference at all. If there is a pronoun, it refers511

512
    Item being marked for coming from Chipaya but can be verified for Uchumataqu by e g. Métraux
(1935 106)
511
    What the author says on the notion of control only serves as a basis for the following considerations I
do not apply Haiman's (1983a) theory here.
5,4
    There are a few instances in which causative -sna is followed or preceded by elements such as -in, -ra,
or -CM (see example 76), none of which can be sufficiently explained Therefore, these instances are not
regarded as meaningful elements of Uchumataqu but rather as misinterpretations
232                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
mainly to the causer, and only in two cases causer and causée are marked by
pronouns. It is to note that the data contain mainly singular items (as demonstrated in
examples 73 and 74) which do not constitute entire clauses and therefore it remains
uncertain how person reference would have been expressed. The following clause
(76) demonstrates the use of causer and causée where word order (causee-causer)
prevents a possessive interpretation.
(76)       suwa wir lula-ska-cu-cay
           child    I     eat-CAU-?-DEC
           'I feed the child (lit: 'I make the child eat.')·' (Muysken 2005:57)
It is only in Vellard's data (1949-67) that the form -am appears, which according to
Vellard (1967:33) marks a causative, as demonstrated below.
(77)       ma:s-na     cuke tihus-ki        ana hipu saxk-aru
           stone-iNS let_us cover-TOP NEG wind run-'make'

However, the form -am occurs only with the verb saxk- 'to run' and example (77) is
the only complete clause that contains -am. Therefore, I do not regard the form -am
as marking a causative515 although a definite answer to what it expresses cannot be
given.","[247, 248, 249]"
"1.4.2.3.2 Manuscript from Ch'imu (fair copy)
In contrast to the preceding manuscript, Lehmann supplies more detailed background
information in the manuscript from Ch'imu and also refers to his visit to Ancoaqui.
He visited Ch'imu on 26lh October 1929 where he met Florentino Valcufia, an elderly
fisherman who lived in the village. According to Lehmann's description, he started
working with Florentino Valcufia on the spot and collected a few hundred words.
When Florentino's son Nicolas Valcufia, alcalde90 of Ch'imu, appeared Lehmann
persuaded Nicolas to accompany him to Puno. They kept working at Lehmann's
hotel in Puno but Nicolas Valcufia returned to Ch'imu the same night. Although
Lehmann mentions her in the manuscript, the marniti Juanita Cuno did not
contribute to the data collection. Again, Lehmann spent only one afternoon in the Uni
community and did not return for further interviews. However, it is noteworthy that
Lehmann was the only researcher ever to have visited Ch'imu for the purpose of
collecting linguistic data. As such, his manuscript from Ch'imu can be regarded as
unique.
     Lehmann's interpreter was Enrique Rodriguez Averanta, as is stated in the
original manuscript92; in the fair copy Lehmann (1929d:iii)93 only mentions that the
interpreter is a ""known poet"". He spoke Aymara with the Valcufia family and the
languages thus used in data recording were Spanish, Aymara, and Uchumataqu.
     Lehmann made the fair copy in his hotel in La Paz (date unspecified) and on
board the ship back to Europe. The date given here is January 30th 1930, i.e. about
three months after his trip to Ch'imu. Like in the Ancoaqui manuscript Lehmann uses
Spanish, again with the exception of the introduction and some terms of which he
possibly did not know the Spanish name.
     The manuscript from Ch'imu is slightly shorter than the one from Ancoaqui and
consists of 29 pages with 324 entries. Until p. 14 / 188 the word list is ordered     Alcalde can be equated with the function of a mayor

alphabetically and contains mainly the same items as the Ancoaqui list, i.e. mainly
concrete nouns referring to body parts, clothing and such. On the following five
pages, Lehmann provides directions, temporal adverbs and expressions as well as
conjugations of the verbs 'to be' and 'to eat' and a possessive paradigm for the word
'house'. Numerals 1 to 10, 20, and 40 are provided on p. 19 to be followed by further
lexical entries, which do not belong to a particular semantic field but comprise only
nouns. Page 24 / 273 contains another example of a possessive paradigm of 'house',
which, however, is note complete since second and third person plural are missing.
Lehmann supplies purely lexical information on the following pages, but on pp. 27
and 28 adds conjugations of the verbs 'to be' and 'to give', again providing single
entries on 'I am not', 'I was', and 'I was not'. The verb 'to give' is used as an
example of a transitive verb. Lehmann repeats the drawing of the traditional loom
from Ancoaqui but this time lists thirteen items designating its parts. The headline
clearly states that the drawing was made two weeks earlier in Ancoaqui, so it is likely
that Lehmann used the older drawing in the absence of a real loom to collect some
more terms with Nicolas Valcuna. Most of these are German, probably because
Lehmann did not have the appropriate Spanish word at hand.
      According to a final note, Lehmann wrote the introduction on March δ""1 1937 in
Berlin, i.e. almost eight years after his trip to Ancoaqui and Ch'imu.
     As mentioned above, Lehmann notes which data were contributed by Florentino
or Nicolas Valcuna. It is noteworthy that the items provided by Florentino Valcufla
show a higher degree of Aymara influence than do those of his son Nicolas. This is
particularly the case with numerals and possessive paradigms. Florentino counts in
Uchumataqu until 4 but changes to Aymara then, while Nicolas gives all the
numerals in Uchumataqu. A similar observation concerns the possessive paradigms:
the one provided by Florentino is incomplete (see above) and it shows considerable
influence from Aymara due to the suffixed endings -ma and -pa. The paradigm given
by Nicolas is complete and is close to what other sources report as possession
marking, although Nicolas gives anxat as the pronoun of third person singular, which
cannot be confirmed by other sources. We find the following distribution of the data:
in more concrete fields, such as e.g. the making of balsa rafts, food, and animals,
most of the data were provided by Florentino Valcuna, whereas more abstract terms,
such as temporal adverbs, directions and all grammatical items were contributed by
his son Nicolas. As to the reason, we can only speculate. It is possible that Lehmann
found Nicolas a more suitable language consultant on Uchumataqu than his father.
      With respect to how the data were collected, the manuscript from Ch'imu is
restricted by the same considerations as is the one from Ancoaqui, although Lehmann
supplies information about his language consultants. An evaluation of the linguistic
data is hardly possible due to the following reasons. First, the items provided by
Florentino Valcuna are to a certain degree influenced by Aymara, and his command
of Uchumataqu seems to have been weaker than that of his son. Second, since
Lehmann is the only person ever to have collected data in Ch'imu, a comparison with
the remaining sources, all on Ancoaqui, would not yield reliable results. Differences
can be ascribed to a higher degree of language attrition in Ch'imu and / or to dialectal
variation. Since there is no further material on Ch'imu, the question for dialectal
40                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
variation has to remain unanswered. What can be said is that even in those cases
where a Ch'imu word is close to its Ancoaqui equivalent, we almost always find
slight differences. In other cases, in particular in the verbal paradigms, the data
cannot be verified at all, i.e. they are neither Uchumataqu nor e.g. Aymara. This is
the case with e.g. anxata inarata (Lehmann 1929d:17), which is translated as 'he
eats' but inarata is neither Uchumataqu nor Aymara nor Quechua (for anxata see
above). Thus, data from the Ch'imu manuscript will be used only when they can be
verified by other sources on Ancoaqui.","[55, 56, 57]"

allophone of Is/ for the following reasons: it has a tendency to occur in word initial
position followed by /i/, /e/, or /a/, and although the sources are not entirely
homogeneous, the following examples can be found in most of the sources.

           sax.Ki '.cay        '(s)he will run'               (Vellard 1951:29)
However, when followed by /o/ or lul, there is a tendency to use [s] instead of [ƒ].

Thus, I propose that postalveolar [ƒ] is an allophone of alveolar /s/ in word initial
position. The postalveolar variety appears before front vowels, i.e. /il. Id, or Id,
whereas the alveolar variety occurs before back vowels lul and lol. However, the
distribution is not entirely homogeneous and there are counterexamples, as e.g. si:
'warmth (of the sun)' (see above). In a position other than word initially, both
variants seem to appear in free alternation (cf. example 45).

Since postalveolar [ί] occupies the same positions as alveolar [s] (cf. 43 and 45), no
basic form can be established. However, the sources agree in that they demonstrate a
slight tendency to use [s] over [J].
                                                                   h
[z] It is only in Lehmann's data (1929b, d) that <sh> or <s > appears. It is not
entirely clear which sound it symbolises but I propose that it may be understood as a
voiced alveolar fricative [z]. Lehmann also employs <ä>, the symbol of <sh>
therefore probably does not refer to a postalveolar voiceless fricative. It occupies the
same positions as voiceless [s].

Lehmann (1929d) further uses the symbol <z>, which is also found in Métraux's data
(1935). Neither researcher provides an explanation. On the basis of the International
Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), I propose that it is a voiced alveolar fricative [z]. This
assumption is supported by the alternative forms provided by the authors (47).

[θ] The symbol <s> used by Lehmann (1929) is defined as interdental (Lehmann
1920:9), and can be assumed to be voiceless. It occurs twice in his data, as in (48).

<φ> This symbol is found only in the work of Vellard (1949-67), but the author does
not provide a defintion. If one compares the contexts it appears in with the remaining
sources, it becomes apparent that its range varies between what otherwise is
transcribed as [s], [ƒ], or [c]. Since Vellard uses these symbols, too, «£> must denote
yet another sound and based on the comparison with the remaining sources, I propose
that <0> may be equated with the interdental [Θ] mentioned by Lehmann (see above).
<0> occurs mainly word initially, but is also found in the onset of a syllable, where in
most cases it appears in an intervocalic environment.(49)      Ηο.φα                    'peak; nose'         (Vellard 1949:164)

[χ] A voiceless uvular fricative occurs in Lehmann's (1929), LaBarre's, (1941) and
Palavecino's (1949) data. LaBarre and Palavecino symbolise it by <χ>, while
Lehmann transcribes it as <χ>. Example (52) demonstrates its usage.

[ç] Only Lehmann (1929) and Vellard (1949-67) do mention a voiceless palatal
fricative. Lehmann represents it as <χ>, while Vellard symbolses it by <K> and
defines it as 'the palatal fricative K' 169 (translation mine). As already discussed under
2.2, <K> appears to be used as a plosive rather than a fricative in Vellard's data (for
examples and further discussion, cf. 2.2).

[xw] Labialisation170 of velar fricative /x/ is not present in every source, but found
only in Lehmann (1929d), Métraux (1935), and to a minor degree in the work of
Vellard (1949-67). Métraux sometimes also uses <xua> instead of <xw>. According
to the sources, labialisation of fricatives is restricted to a few items and occurs only in
word initial position or in syllable onset.
(57)       sa.xwe                'urine'                         (Métraux 1935:109)

           tu.sa.xwi             'Is it a balsa raft?'         (Vellard 1967:24)
<x>There is only one instance found in Métraux (1935) where a feeble articulation of
[x] (represented as <x>) is used in a context other than /k/ (cf. 2.2). Example (58)
shows this item. It has to be noted that 'to be' is usually trancribed as selx- in
Métraux.
(58)       seF.ca                'to be (here: to have)'           (Métraux 1935:91)
<é> Vellard (1949:150) also mentions a prepalatal fricative which he symbolises by
<é> and defines as ""prepalatal fricative (voiced German ch)'172 (translation mine).
This description refers to the so-called ich-Laut which should be represented as [ç],
i.e. as a voiceless palatal fricative. However, Vellard (ibid.) assigns this quality to
<K> (see above). No instance can be found where Vellard actually uses <é> as a
fricative but all contexts suggest a simple vowel reading (cf. 59).
(59)       ha.na séls.-asul -cay 'we do not exist' m               (Vellard 1951:33)/h/
[h] Although it is used in all sources174, only a few provide an explanation of the
symbol <h>. Lehmann (1920:9) describes it as an aspirated fricative and Vellard
(1949:150) points out that it is always voiced. It is likely that this characterisation is
valid for Vellard's other publications as well (1950, 1951, 1967). On the basis of
these descriptions, I label Ihl as a voiced glottal fricative. However, the context of its
usage suggests that it may resemble a palatal or velar fricative, since e.g. Métraux
(1935:95) transcribes 'tomorrow' as either haka or xaka (cf. Huayhua Pari 2001:76
on Aymara /h/; Cerrón-Palomino 2006:50 on velar fricative /x/).
     Sources between 1894 and 1935 demonstrate only a word initial position of/h/,
and it is only in Vellard's data that l\\l occurs elsewhere. Example (60) shows its
word initial position.

Although the majority of Vellard's data (1949-67) also demonstrate /hi used word-
initially, other positions are reported as well. Of 51 items that contain non-word
initial /h/, 45 have it in a syllable onset, mainly intervocalically, two times /h/ occurs
in a syllable coda, and only once word finally. It can occur pre- and post-
consonantally without constraints. Example (61) shows its distribution in Vellard's
data.(61)        hi.-ra                'tunique'

            wis.nah115            'we; our'                          (Vellard 1949:164)[h] The symbol <h> appears only in Lehmann's (1929) and Vellard's (1950, 1951)
data but no explanation is provided and thus, any description must be based on
external sources. Schmidt (1907:832) labels it a pharyngeal sound. This is in
accordance with Lehmann (1920:9) who further specifies it as voiceless. Meillet and
Cohen (1952:xiii) agree on that <h> is voiceless but elsewhere call it laryngeal.
However, in the modem literature (e.g. Clark and Yallop 1995:423) the term
laryngeal is used differently and cannot be understood as voiceless. I therefore
choose the term pharyngeal and label <h> as a voiceless pharyngeal fricative [h]. [h]
occurs only eight times in the data, and half of these items originate from Aymara.
The remaining four items include two expressions that belong to the semantic field of
fire and the word hiuk'i 'light' (Lehmann 1929d:10) cannot be verified for sources
other than Lehmann's. This leaves three expressions containg [h] (see example 62)
where it occurs either in a syllable coda or word finally.(62)        uh.-cay I uh.ci.-cay        'fire'                       (Vellard 1950:64)

It is possible that the word final use of [h] is conditioned by the preceding uvular
fricative [χ], which causes a rather pharyngeal than glottalic realisation. This may be
true for the word for 'fire' and its derivations as well, where the following velar
plosive or palatal affricate, respectively, may be the cause of a pharyngeal perception.
On the basis of these considerations, it seems justified to ascribe [h] allophonic
status, with its occurence restricted to coda or word final position conditioned by a
velar or palatal environment.
      In Vellard's data a certain amount of variation occurs concerning the word for
'fire'. Example (63) demonstrates not only metathesis but also shows that within one
source the choice of glottal [h] or pharyngealised [h] varies (please compare example
62 to example 63). No other sources provide similar evidence.","[88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"
"3.4.2 Noun incorporation
As Croft (2003:168) puts it, ""[n]oun incorporation is the phenomenon by which a
noun is so closely bound to a verb grammatically that it is considered to be part of
it."". Thus, noun incorporation can be viewed as a subcategory of compounding and is
therefore likewise a derivational process. Croft (2003:169) further points out that
direct objects are the nouns which are most likely to be incorporated, while Anderson
(1985:54) adds that subjects of intransitive verbs may also be incorporated.
      The analysis of noun incorporation in Uchumataqu is affected by the same
source-related methodological restrictions as nominal compounding, but there are
two particular factors that contribute to an even higher degree of uncertainty. First,
Uchumataqu does not mark a direct object morphologically and thus, noun
incorporation cannot be attested by the non-application of a particular morphological
marker. Second, since the principal word order is SOV it is often not determinable
syntactically whether an item is an instance of noun incorporation or a simple
nominal phrase (subject or direct object) followed by a verb phrase, as in example
(38).

          'I want a woman (= wife).'                  (Vellard 1967:14)
Therefore, the most reliable means to establish noun incorporation are semantic (as is
the case with nominal compounding), i.e. the degree of lexicalisation and
compositionality. In some cases, morphological markers, such as clitics, indicate that
the item in question is not an instance of noun incorporation.
      Uchumataqu hardly ever employs noun incorporation and there are indeed only
a few instances that could be interpreted as such. In comparison to the more common
nominal compounding, noun incorporation appears to be exceptional. What may be
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                     143
said of Uchumataqu noun incorporation is that in most cases a direct objet is
incorporated into a (transitive) action-process verb and the resulting compounds are
verbs or nouns. The few instances of noun incorporation suggest that they are
exocentric (e.g. 39 and 40), in contrast to nominal compounding, which is mainly
endocentric. Word order is OV in all but one case. Since the number of possible
instances is limited, nothing can be said about particular semantic fields where noun
incorporation occurs.

Example (41) shows an instance where the resulting compound is a verb.

           'unable to remember (lit.: 'heart lost')'                (Velard 1951:35)
There is also a synthetic expression for 'unable to remember', which is kata-ni-cay
'to forget'(Vellard 1951:35).
     The following example is in two ways outstanding. First, it is the only example
where a subject is incorporated into an intransitive motion verb, and second, we find
a reversed order of verb and subject.

In sum, I would like to conclude that noun incorporation does not seem to be a
regular means of deriving new lexical items in Uchumataqu. Whereas nominal
compounding is used frequently, noun incorporation appears to be rather occasional
and limited to a few items only. It is possible that this restriction is in part due to the
more regular use of chain verb constructions or that Uchumataqu syntactic structure
already resembles noun incorporation by not marking a direct object, which in most
cases is immediately followed by the verbal predicate. It is unlikely that the lack of
noun incorporation is due to language attrition since nominal compounding is
testified for every source.","[159, 160]"

The word order of complement clauses is SOV, OV, or SV with the complement
preceding the matrix verb. If there is an indirect complement, it often precedes the
direct complement, as in (87) and (88).

However, variation in word order is possible (89) although it occurs more often with
the chain verb construction. In somes cases, other constituents can appear between
the complements and its matrix verb (90).

It can be argued that the following case forms a subcategory of the chain verb
construction. What is striking is that the matrix verb behaves like the complement
and vice versa, i.e. the matrix verb (which is always pek- 'to want') is unmarked and
precedes the complement which bears person, tense / aspect marking, and declarative
-cay. However, the translation suggests a normal complement clause interpretation.

According to Payne (1997:233), this construction may be a verb-verb compound
which he defines as follows: ""[...] both roots are recognizable verbs in their own
right, but nothing can come in between them, and the meaning of the whole structure
is 'bleached', i.e., slightly different from the combination of the lexical meanings of
the two roots [...]."" (marking by the author). Although the database on this
phenomenon is limited, the first two requirements can be regarded as fulfilled, i.e.
both roots are verbs in their own rights and their combination is not split up by other
components. With respect to the last requirement, we have to rely on the translations656
   Métraux added in parentheses 'wiéi sus""1' Since the nature of this comment is uncertain, it is not dealt
with here
*"" Since 'to rest' is an intransitive verb, object marker -« may suggest a reflexive meaning here

offered in the sources which do not suggest a change of meaning. Thus, within this
possible compound, the verb forms are not translated any different from a
complement-verb construction. Thus, constructions as in (91) stand somewhere in
between complements and verb-verb compounds and I view them as a subcategory of
the chain verb constructions.
      Finally, I would like to add a note concerning the difference between
complements marked by action nominaliser -s(i) and chain verb constructions. Both
means show a certain similarity in that they are used for complementation and almost
always occur with pek- 'to want' as the matrix verb. Thus, the question of their
difference in meaning arises. Since the database is not extensive and for most cases,
we lack a context, the following has to be regarded as speculative. We may assume
that the missing marking of complement verbs in chain verb constructions conveys
the idea of a greater semantic integration into the matrix than is the case with -s(i)-
marked complements and it may be possible that zero marked verbs then denote a
permanent or long-standing wish or desire in contrast to complements inflected with
the action nominaliser. If this assumption is correct, then e.g. (84) could be
understood as a permanent refusal to drink, i.e. the person never drinks, while e.g.
(87) denotes a momentary wish. This hypothesis is further supported by the use of the
temporal adverb hase 'now' in (87).","[304, 305, 306]"
"2.5 Affricates
Uchumataqu has a set of two affricates, /ts/ and /tj/, which show the same pattern of
distribution./ts/
[ts] The dental voiceless affricate occurs word initially and in the onset of a syllable,
often occupying an intervocalic position.
(65)           tsa.ta.ki.ca          'we will dance'                         (Uhle 1894:92.1)
               kha.tsi               'bag'                                   (Lehmann 1929b:2)
However, dental affricate /ts/ does not appear in coda position, and accordingly is
found in word final position presumably only in case of final vowel elision (cf. 66
u'ats para). It is pre-consonantally only in word initial position and its post-
consonantal occurence is restricted to a few items, as example (66) demonstrates.
(66)           u 'ats pa.ra116        'chipped wood of the loom' (Lehmann 1929d:30)
               tsma.ya               'a fly'                     (Lehmann 1929b: 11 )
               cem.tsa""7             'sky, heaven'               (Métraux 1935:93)
The data on aspirated and glottalised affricates are quite limited and only seven items
with these features can be established. Only two of them do occur in more than one
source and these items do not correspond with respect to the feature in question.
Furthermore, no example of an aspirated palatal affricate *<ôh> can be provided.
These considerations would suggest that neither aspiration nor glottalisation of
affricates is an original feature of Uchumataqu. However, none of the seven
expressions is a loan from Aymara or Quechua, and thus, it seems possible to
m
      This compound consists of walsi 'the weaving' and para 'stick'

      This item also forms part of the expression cuk-cemtsa 'eye lashes'.

propose that Uchumataqu, too, has aspirated and glottalised affricates'78. Since the
database is severely limited and because the only two re-occuring items do not
correspond with each other, I am unable to pronounce on the phonemic or allophonic
status of the sounds presented below179. Therefore, the following will be limited to a
mere presentation of the data. However, it has to be noted that counterexamples to all
instances exist, i.e. the sources are by no means homogeneous.
     All but one instance occur word initially and Cerrón-Palomino (2006:45ff)
mentions similar restrictions for aspirated and glottalised affricates in Chipaya.
[tsh] The aspirated dental affricate occurs word initially and is transcribed as <tsh>.
(67)        tshiji1*0                'bone'                          (Uhle 1894:1a)
[ts'] The glottalised dental affricate is likewise restricted to a word initial position.
The sources symbolise it by <ts'>.

[d3] Lehmann (1929) further distinguishes a voiced dental affricate, which he
transcribes as <dz> (see example 69). It occurs only in his data and is restricted to the
semantic field of 'weaving'. Thus, I do not regard it to be a regular sound of
Uchumataqu.
(69)        hua.dzi               'loom'                             (Lehmann 1929b:23)
<tz> The symbol <tz> as used by Posnansky may also be mentioned here. The author
does not provide an explanation and it remains thus uncertain whether the symbol
represents a voiced or voiceless dental affricate. The following is the only instance of
<tz> found in Posnansky's data.
(70)        ka.tzi                'bag for coca'                     (Posnansky 1934:286)/ti/
[tl] The palatal voiceless affricate is transcribed in all sources as <c> except for
Lehmann ( 1929), who symbolises it by <tä>. It appears in a word initial position and
in the onset of a syllable, where it often occupies an intervocalic position Example
(71) demonstrates its more regular use in word initial position, in a syllable onset as
well as post-consonantally and intervocalically.
(71)        cu.ma                 'wool'                             (Vellard 1950:78)

178
    Further support to this view comes from the toponym Ch'imu which itself contains a glottalised palatal
affricate. However, this toponym may come from a language spoken there before or from Aymara and
thus, it is no firm proof of the assumption mentioned above
179
    For this incertitude I decide to represent them in the form of allophones, ι e by brackets rather than as
phonemes, ι e by forward slashes

78                          UCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAThe palatal voiceless affricate occurs in word final and coda position mainly in case
of vowel elision, as in non-simplex forms or compounds, and only a few simplex
forms contain /tj/ in these positions It is particularly in this environment that l\\l
occurs pre-consonantally

[tj'] The glottahsed palatal affricate is represented as <ò'> and occurs in all but one
instances word initially Example (74) shows the only exception
(73)       c'a ta ca            'to bite'                        (Uhle 1894 18 1)
Example (74) shows the only instance where <c'> occurs in such a position since
every other source presents -paca without a glottal stop Beside, neither Aymara nor
Quechua181 demonstrate a glottahsation of -paca, which suggests that -pac'a is an
irregularity
(74)       wakpac'a             'all, everything,-body'          (Vellard 1967 21)
[}] Lehmann (1929) and Metraux (1935) further note a voiced palatal affricate, which
they transcribe as either <dz> (Lehmann 1929) or <j> (Metraux 1935) Since no
sources other than these mention a voiced palatal affricate, I do not consider it to be a
regular feature of Uchumataqu
      The voiced palatal affricate occurs only a few times in Lehmann's data and is
restricted to either a word initial or syllable onset position
(75)       dziu'i               'white'                          (Lehmann 1929b 2)

The voiced palatal affricate <j> in Metraux (1935) appears with one exception only
in -ja, ι e as an alternative form of declarative marker -cay The voiced palatal
affricate <j> occurs thus only in a particular phonological (a syllable onset) and
morphological (the declarative marking suffix) environment and is more restricted
than the regular voiceless palatal affricate /tj/

Uchumataqu has two lateral sounds, an alveolar lateral and a palatal/I/
[1] Apart from Uhle (1894 1), who ascribes to <1> a sometimes slightly palatalised
quality, no other author offers a description of <1> Thus, the classification of this
sound relies on external sources which agree on that it is a voiced alveolar lateral

(Schmidt 1907:862, Lehmann 1920:9, Meillet and Cohen 1952:xiii). In what follows,
I adopt this characterisation of IM. It occurs word initially, and in syllable onset and
coda, in an intervocalic or pre-consonantal position.

The evidence for a word final position of /I/ is weak and the data suggest that it
occurs mainly in case of vowel elision, as is the case with cui 'what?' (cf. 78), where
final <u> is deleted. Sometimes the sources show the so-called infinitive form of a
verb which then may end in /I/. However, these are mostly citation forms and are not
used in more natural speech.

The following instance is found in Métraux and Vellard and depending on its
transcription, it is either an example of a simplex form ending in l\l or else the only
example of post-consonantal position of IV.

[L] Vellard (1950:56) uses the symbols <fl> and <1>, which he describes as follows:
""a very deep / reminicent of Russian /. We sometimes marked it by a bar, sometimes
by/7.""183 (translation mine). Thus, both <fl> and <1> represent the same sound which,
according to the description, may be classified as a voiced velar lateral since the most
backward manner of articulation found with laterals is velar (cf. Meillet and Cohen
1952:xiii). In modem IPA (1996), this sound is symbolised by [L]. The presumed
velar lateral occurs only with two words, as demonstrated in example (80).

Only once does Vellard (1950:83) transcribe 'totora' as luua but specifies /I/ as
""Russian 1, deep""185.

    A similar pronounciation is observed by Pieter Muysken for the modem data of Uchumataqu (personal
communication).
80                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAlateral which according to modem IP A is represented as |Ί]. The manner of
articulation is not further specified. Lehmann (1929) also mentions a voiceless
lateral, which he represents as <1>:
(81)        u'ël.ti.ni            'cooked'                              (Lehmann 1929b:4)IRI
[X] The voiced palatal lateral is transcribed in different ways: Lehmann symbolises it
as <ly>, Métraux uses <Γ>, while Vellard represents it as <1>186. Of these, only
Métraux (1935:90) does further specify the symbol and therefore, its classification as
palatal is in part based on external sources. Métraux describes <Γ> as ""[...] the «11» or
palatalised 1 of the same language [i.e. Spanish].""187 (translation mine)', i.e. <Γ> is a
palatal sound. One example provided by Métraux, which appears in most sources, is
xil'i 'meat' and thus, by way of comparison it is possible a) to establish the existence
of this lateral sound for the remaining sources, and b) to assume that it is palatal since
the context it appears in is the same as in Métraux, who characterises <Γ> as palatal.
On the basis of these considerations it is possible to classify the symbol <ly> used by
Lehmann (1929; cf. 4) as representing a palatal lateral. However, the symbol used to
transcribe IAl in the texts of Vellard (<1>) is explained by Meillet and Cohen
(1952:xiii) as pre-palatal, but since I lack further explications, I would like to
maintain the more basic notion of a voiced palatal lateral188 (cf. Lehmann 1920:9,
Cerrón-Palomino 2006:54, IPA 1996).
       The occurence of IAl is restricted. The sources provide only a few and not
entirely clear instances for a word initial position and only for its occurence in a
syllable onset do we have sufficient and reliable data. Despite these restrictions, it is
likely that IAl has phonemic status since it appears mainly in the same positions189
and environments as /I/, i.e. no complementary distribution can be established.
However, it is noteworthy that there is an unusually high percentage (39,40%) of loan
words from Aymara, Quechua, or Spanish containing IAl.

Uchumataqu has a set of two semivowels, /y/ and /w/, whose interpretation as
semivowels is in part inspired by external sources. With respect to lyl, none of the
sources provide an explanation and the external sources are sometimes contradictory.
Thus, in Lehmann (1920:9), lyl is classified as a ""post-palatal guttural sound"", i.e. a186
    It has to be noted that in Vellard 1949 and Vellard 1967 no voiced palatal lateral is mentioned.

postpalatal fricative. The context in which <y> is used in Lehmann's manuscripts
(1929) does not support this interpretation but rather suggests a reading as semivowel
(see examples below). Therefore, I adopt the classification of lyl as a prepalatal
semivowel, as given in Meillet and Cohen (1952:xiii).
Only Utile (1894:1a) and Métraux do classify /w/; Uhle describes it as ""like English
w"" (translation mine)191 while Métraux (1935:90) notes that ""M is a semivowel close
to w""'92 (translation mine). Thus, both authors agree on that /w/ is a semivowel but do
not refer to the manner of articulation. Meillet and Cohen (1952:xiii) describe /w/ as
a labio-velar semivowel and I will maintain this interpretation. I regard both lyl and
/w/ as voiced since according to Clark and Yallop (1995:48), ""[a]pproximants193 are
normally voiced"" and my data do not demonstrate evidence to the contrary.hi'
[y] The voiced prepalatal semivowel occurs word initially and finally, in a syllable
onset and coda, taking a pre-consonantal or intervocalic position. Nominal and verbal
stems do not have lyl in word final position, where it occurs only in non-simplex
forms or after vowel elision.

[w] In the overwhelming majority of cases, the voiced labio-velar semivowel appears
word initially and in the onset of a syllable, thus mainly intervocalically. Only in one
instance does Iv/I appear post-consonantally. Most sources spell it <w>, but a spelling
as <hua>, hue>, or <hui> is also found, although it is less common.

82                            UCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAThere is only one example for a word final position of /w/ but since vocalisation (cf

<w> insead of <v> The expression civi 'white' is elsewhere transenbed as <w>, as
in ciwi (Vellard 1951 790) I therefore consider <v> to be a voiced labiodental

<u> This symbol is used only by Métraux (1935), who notes that ""u is a semivowel

allophone of semivowel /w/, although in some cases Métraux seems to treat <u> as
an allophone of/u/ rather than of/w/ (cf 2 12 1 2)

In what follows, two features of Uchumataqu will be presented that are not confined
to a particular phoneme but occur with different phonemes One of these features is
the insertion of a nasal consonant, the other one deals with the feeble anculation of
consonants
     The insertion of a nasal consonant is mentioned by Lehmann (1929d), and
Vellard (1950, 1951) Example (88) demonstrates its usage
(88)         pa"" tees ""a          'forty'                              (Lehmann 1929d 20)

The word tees""a is not found in sources other than Lehmann (1929d) and nasalisation
is a frequent phenomenon in Vellard's data, which can be traced back to a possible
French interference (cf 2 9) Furthermore, the items cited in example (88) do not
correspond to other sources and therefore, I do not regard nasalisation to have
phonemic value
      It is mainly in Lehmann's data (1929) that further instances of the so-called
feeble articulation (cf Meillet and Cohen 1952 xiv) occur Since feeble consonantal
articulation occurs mainly in Lehmann's manuscripts, I will present it only bnefly in

2.9 Vowels
The methodological considerations for establishing vowels and the sections dealing
with them are the same as for consonants.
     All sources mention a five-vowel system with each vowel having phonemic
value and all documents have at least two vowel types: an unmarked vowel of middle
length and a lengthened variant which is also phonemic. A five-vowel system is
unique among the Andean languages. However, apart from an unmarked vowel of
middle length and a lengthened variant, Uhle (1894), Lehmann (1929), and Vellard
(1949-67) also report short vowels. These short vowels are mostly restricted with
respect to the positions they can take, and there is no unequivocal example
demonstrating their use. Given these considerations, I will describe short vowels as
allophones of both the middle and long variants. There is considerable variation in
the sources concerning the distribution of short, middle, and long vowels, which
makes it impossible to state which environment conditions the use of which type. The
positions a vowel can occupy are given at the beginning of each section. Thus, it is
possible to establish the following scheme for Uchumataqu vowels.","[93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]"

            'There is little.'                                      (Métraux 1935:103)5.4 Grammatical function markers
In what follows, a group of three verbal affixes is presented whose purpose is to
indicate the grammatical functions the verbal arguments fulfil in the clause500. Two
of these markers refer to first person sg and pi (OBl s- and su -s), while the third
marker refers to all other persons (OB2 -n)50]. The object markers, which are OBl s-
and OB2 -n, can be considered obligatory since they occur with transitive verbs that
require a direct complement. The subject marker -s is probably emphatic or
reinforcing rather than strictly obligatory, although this cannot be definitely
established. It is interesting to note that no morpheme is found which marks a person
other than first person as subject. Thus, a first person is prominent over all other
persons in the grammatical function marking system. However, this fits well in with
the overall organisation of Uchumataqu since the language also marks explicitly only
a first person singular in present and future tense tense (by the means of -u and -a,
respectively).
      The following clause shows the interconnections of the clause arguments. Parts
that belong together or refer to each other are in bold or underlined, respectively.

The verbal object marker (OBl) s- is the only prefix that was still productive at the
time Uchumataqu was documented and the productive use of prefixes sets the
language apart from Aymara and Quechua, which do not have such devices. It
constitutes a grammatical function marker since it designates a first person as object.
It is immediately followed by the verb stem (58, 59).

            food OBl-give-OB2-iMP502

            'You are a good man, you don't beat me.' (Métraux 1935:92)
As can be seen in examples (58) and (59), object marker s- refers to first person
singular, but there is also one instance in which it marks a first person plural
inclusive as object (60). Since subject marker -s (cf. 5.4.2) serves for both first person    The clitic elements -/, -m, -s can also serve to indicate the subject and object of a clause. For a more
detailed discussion, cf. 7.3.

    The morphemes will be presented in the order of their appearance, i.e. s-, -s, and -n

singular and plural, it is likely that the object marker does the same although in my
data it designates mostly a first person singular.

                                                               (Vellard 1949:166)
Object marker s- appears together with action and action-process verbs since only a
transitive verb can require the marker. This excludes at least motion, position, and
stative verbs (cf. 5.4.3) but it remains uncertain whether the marker could occur with
factive, utterance, cognition, or sensation verbs as e.g. in 'tell me' (61). However, the
following points to the contrary although this may be due to language attrition.
(61)       culu si-si-n-aki         wir-xo
           what tell-tell-OB2-FU I-QTP
           'What will you tell me?'                                 (Vellard 1967:32)
Although object marker Ä- can possibly occur on its own (62), in most cases it is
accompanied by both subject and object (pronouns) (cf. 60, 63) or else person
reference is indicated on the verb, as in (58).
(62)        is-ta-llasm
           OB 1 -give-POL
           '[Please], give me.'                                     (Lehmann 1929d:28)
(63)       am     wir is-ta-lla
           you    I    OB 1-give-POL
           'You (sg) give me [please].'                             (Lehmann 1929d:28)
This leads to the question whether the use of object marker i- has to be considered
obligatory, and hence whether accompanying pronouns or person reference indicated
on the verb are merely emphatic. No hard and firm conclusions can be drawn, but it
is well possible that at a time when Uchumataqu was not yet endangered, object
marker 5- was obligatory since transitive verbs require a direct complement. In this
case, pronouns would have been used only emphatically. Its use as manifest in my
data points to a reinforcing rather than an obligatory status and in later documents
(Vellard 1950-67, Muysken 2005) first person object is marked by either pronouns
(cf. 61) or else context, i.e. OBl s- is not in use any more. However, this may be a
result of language attrition and the growing influence of Spanish. On the basis of
these considerations, I propose that object marker s- was probably once obligatory
but at the time of its documentation has to be considered merely reinforcing. As can
be seen in example (60), object marker s- is not bound to a specific tense.","[242, 243, 244]"
"1.4.2.5.4 Vellard 1967
Vellard's article Contribution al estudio de la lengua Uru was published in 1967120.
Vellard himself does not provide any introductory notes, but instead, the brief
introduction is written by Salvador Bucca, who points out that the edition is to be
understood as a complement to Vellard's preceding work on the Uru (1949-1951).
However, the consultation of them is recommended in order to fully comprehend this
edition. The editor also points to phonological variation apparent in the texts. Apart
from this, no further information is provided on how and when the data were
obtained or on the editing process. It thus remains uncertain whether Vellard himself
carried out the translation, analysis, and interpretation of the data or whether another
researcher was involved. The document was published in Spanish in Buenos Aires.
     Although not mentioned explicitly, it becomes apparent in the footnotes that the
language consultants were Manuel and Luis Inta and Carlos Kispe. Luis Inta is
described as ""a mestizo who speaks a very incorrect language""121 (Vellard 1967:36,

50                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
translation mine). Dates on pp. 36 and 37 point to the possibility that the data were
collected in 1942 and 1944, except for the data provided by Luis Inta, which
probably come from 1952 (Vellard 1967:34, 36, 37). However, as a footnote (Vellard
1967:36) states the prayers ""Confesión"" and ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" were
recorded nearly ten years after Vellard's first field-work campaign, which, if this
were true, would have been in 1948. This does not correspond to the dates proposed
in table 1.4, for which I am unable to provide an explanation. As usually, no
information on the duration of Vellard's field-work is given.
     The data consist mainly of single clauses and only in some cases do more
comprehensive sequences occur, such as question and response. The clauses are of
varying length and complexity and include imperative and interrogative clauses as
well (Vellard 1967:1-24). They are all provided with a word-by-word as well as free
translation. This section is followed by a sample of adverbs and conjunctions
(Vellard 1967:24-26) and interrogative pronouns (Vellard 1967:26). These
grammatical observations are continued by a brief overview of some suffixes, which
are called ""particles with prepositional force""122 (Vellard 1967:27, translation mine),
whose use is further exemplified by clauses (Vellard 1967:28-32). This part is
followed by some basic grammatical observations, which deal with e.g. reduplication
as a means of reinforcement or the meaning of cuki 'let us' in imperative clauses
(Vellard 1967:33). The subsequent data were provided by Luis Inta and consist of a
question and the response to it as well as of the prayers mentioned above. A footnote
to ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" states that this prayer is a somewhat corrupted
Aymara version (Vellard 1967:35, footnote 2)' 23 . The article concludes with a
comparison of numerals (Vellard 1967:36, 37). The first comparison comprises
numerals 1 to 10 supplied by Manuel Inta124 compared to numerals as provided by
Posnansky and numerals 1 to 5 from Tiwanaku. The entire comparison is titled
""ancient numeration of the Titicaca region (as remembered by some old people)""125
(Vellard 1967:36, translation mine). A next comparison comprises numerals 1 to 10
from the ""Uru of Irohito""126, Chipaya, and Puquina, following Ore (1607). It is
noteworthy that the numerals given by Manuel Inta and those under the heading of
""Uru of Irohito"" are not identical, although the numerals from Irohito are congruent
with the rest of my data (cf. 4.4). Finally, numerals 1 to 10 from Aymara and
Quechua are compared. Some of the clauses published in 1967 had already appeared
in earlier works of Vellard, mainly that of 1949.
     With respect to evaluation we find a situation similar to the one from 1949, i.e.
most of the data can be verified when compared to e.g. Uhle or Métraux. However, as
already indicated for 1949, the amount of Aymara loan words and grammatical
elements is higher than that in other sources and we find a certain degree of
phonological variation. The data provided by Luis Inta are hardly analysable at all.

analysis and interpretation are best considered separately from each other. The data
themselves are as informative and reliable as those from e.g. Vellard 1949.

Table 1.4· Overview of Vellard's visits to Irohito1.4.2.6 Final remarks
Although the personal backgrounds of the researchers presented above are highly
divergent and most of them did not have any intensive contact with each other, the
52                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
data collected are consistent to a considerable degree. That is, the grammatical
materials provided by Uhle (1894) and Métraux (1935) are very well comparable and
confirm each other's results, which is also true with respect to the lexical material
collected by Polo (1901) and Lehmann (1929). It is only with Vellard's data that we
find a certain difference with regard to the results of the preceding studies, which can
be ascribed to an increasing influence of Aymara and the de facto extinction of
Uchumataqu. It is one of the tragedies of the language that the first researchers
studied Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already highly
endangered, unfortunately left hardly any information on their language consultants,
etc. Therefore, we know virtually nothing about their field trip experiences. Vellard
was the only researcher who bothered to introduce his language consultants and
provided background information on his field-work. However, Vellard visited Irohito
when the community and its language had as good as vanished. Despite these less
favourable circumstances the data found in the several documents can be regarded as
a reliable and highly informative source on Uchumataqu.
      Certain restrictions have to be taken into consideration when dealing with the
sources on Uchumataqu. Although not always mentioned explicitly, we have to
assume that data collection required the use of three languages: Spanish, Aymara,
and Uchumataqu. This gives plenty of room for interference on the language
consultant's as well as on the interpreter's and researcher's parts. Furthermore, none
of the language consultants, interpreters, or researchers was a native speaker of
Spanish127.
      It also has to be taken into consideration that only Uhle had professional
linguistic training, while the other researchers were either social anthropologists or
even came from completely unrelated disciplines. For them, the recording of
Uchumataqu was rather a sideline in their career, which they did not further pursue
(except Vellard)128. This leads to the observation that all researchers lived in a time
when the idea of academic research differed considerably from that of present-day
research. Even those researchers who did not have linguistic or anthropological
training considered themselves qualified to collect linguistic data, a consideration
originating in the old idea of the 'all-round scientist'. Furthermore, there were no
standards or a unified methodology for language documentation and description and
thus, every researcher used his own techniques and methodology. Particularly Uhle
was influenced by a Latin-based grammar model, which he tried to apply to
Uchumataqu. Furthermore, most researchers tried and compared Uchumataqu to
Aymara and, to a lesser degree, to Quechua, which does not yield satisfying results,
particularly with respect to the verbal system. This bias towards a standardised
(Andean) grammar model resulted in turning the language consultant's information
into what was thought appropriate by the researcher, as in the case of Uhle.
     Other aspects that today would be considered inadequate are the short periods of
time spent in the language community as well as the collaboration with only one or
two persons. The average time spent in Irohito was about one week129, which is     With the exception of Polo and Palavecino
     Cf. Muysken and Hannß (2006 218)
     With the exception of Vellard.
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                              53
hardly sufficient to document a language in depth. Thus, particularly complex
features of the language, such as e.g. the verbal system, could not be explored in
detail, even if they were (more or less) fully functional at the time of documentation.
      When talking about language consultants we have to consider that probably
most or all of them would have been men. That is, all the researchers were men and it
is likely that they got into contact with men first and due to the short time they spent
in Irohito could not intensify their contact with women. Therefore, potential gender
distinctions and / or gender related speech130 may have been impossible to record.
The only exception is Vellard, who mentions women among his language consultants
and reports so-called ""phrases d'amour"" (Vellard 1951:21, 22), in which a woman's
speech is recorded.
      It should be emphasised once more that Uchumataqu has been an endangered
language at every stage of its documentation and description, and in the case of
Vellard it has to be regarded as almost extinct. This is of course crucial to the
analysis and interpretation of the data since even in the earliest documents most
complex structures were already simplified, used incorrectly, have simply vanished,
and / or have been replaced by Aymara. These processes explain why in some cases
there are limited, contradictory or even no data at all on particular phenomena. The
process of language death as well as the in part insufficient data collection impose
some considerable restrictions on the data.
      Finally, the researchers were influenced by political and social circumstances.
This is particularly the case for researchers of late 19th century, when the so-called
""War for the Pacific"" (1879-1884) was fought between Chile, Peru, and Bolivia
(Loza 2004:22). This war was followed by rebellions of the indigenous population
against Spanish domination during a time when Uhle was at the Lake Titicaca region
(Loza 2004:23). The rebellions themselves were a kind of prelude to the so-called
""Federal War"" between 1898 and 1899 (ibid.), a time when Polo, too, carried out his
research. Another example of the influence of external factors is that Vellard's final
visit to Irohito in 1952 coincided with a revolt of farmers, miners, and students who
succeeded in installing a new government131. Thus, the political atmosphere was at
times less favourable for European researchers to visit and work in indigenous
communities and might have prevented further studies.
     After having evaluated the sources with respect to their reliability and usefulness
for a grammatical description, I will provide an overview of the numerical
contribution of each document to the amount of data (cf. tab. 1.5). Column Β
provides numbers on purely lexical material as given in word lists, which excludes
Vellard 1949 and 1967. Column C offers the amount of words found in phrases,
clauses, and texts, therefore excluding Bacarreza (1910), Posnansky (1934), LaBarre
(1941), and Palavecino (1949) while in D an overview of the total number of words
in each source is supplied. Columns E and G show the proportion of their
contribution to the whole corpus of data.","[66, 67, 68, 69, 70]"

Only a few instances of terminative -kama are found throughout the sources on
Uchumataqu and it is only in Vellard's data (1949-1967) that we find a more frequent
use of it. Terminative -kama is attached to nouns and temporal adverbs and forms
part of the nominal system. Like other case markers -kama attaches directly to the
stem and is not followed by any other morphemes.
      It has to be noted that from the different functions -kama fulfils in Aymara and
Quechua (tab. 4.5) only a limited aspect has been adopted by Uchumataqu, namely
the terminative function in time. Therefore, -kama is translated as 'until' (but only in
a temporal sense), '(mean)while', or 'during'. As can be expected from this, we find -
kama attached only to nouns or adverbs expressing a temporal aspect.
(28)      uskatan-kama
          moment-TER
          'in a moment, in an instant'                      (Métraux 1935:101)

          (s)he I-TOP no go-iR-FU-DEC                    ten  day-TER
          '(S)he [and] I, we will not part until ten days.' (Vellard 1967:17)
(30)      culuras-kama sel-aki-cay am-ki

          'Until when will you stay (fishing)?'             (Uhle 1894:68.2)
As can be seen from the examples (28-30), terminative -kama expresses two temporal
concepts (as it also does in Aymara and Quechua), which are considered distinct in
Indo-European languages. First, it describes the notion of 'until', i.e. an event with
some (unknown) starting point, but with a fixed end point from where on another
event takes place. 'During' and '(mean)while' rather mark two events being parallel
for at least some time; starting and end point are of no importance here.
With regard to vowel elision or other processes of deleting phonological segments we
hardly find any evidence for that with terminative -kama whereas most Uchumataqu
morphemes show a relatively great range of phonetic reductions e.g. -ki for Allative -
kina or -stan for separative -kistana. A possible explanation might be the status of
terminative -kama as a borrowed morpheme.
      In Aymara the suffix has two different shapes: -kama and -kam, depending on
the number of syllables in the root (Hardman et al. 1986:217, Huayhua Pari
2001:258f). Since Aymara as the providing language offers only the forms of -kama
and -kam the borrowing language Uchumataqu maintains them and does not show the
usual reduction in phonetic shape (to e.g. *-ka).

          'Until tomorrow.'                                 (Vellard 1951:20)
It is not entirely certain how a locational notion of the terminative is expressed, but
there is evidence that is done by the use of the interrogative pronoun xas 'where', as
demonstrated by the following example.

The clause is unmarked for its origin, but possibly comes from Uchumataqu due to its
content. There is evidence in Uhle (1894) that -kama is used to mark a locational
terminative but the examples presented are not marked for their origin and the
evidence it not flirter supported by other sources on Uchumataqu.

Table 4.6: Translation possibilities of terminative -kama4.1.2 Possession     and     beneficiary
Uchumataqu has several means to express possession. As a syntactic means it
employs the juxtaposition of either possessive pronoun and possessed noun (cf. 4.2.2)
or of two nouns. The regular word order is possessor-possessed.
(33)        paku-kurus
            dog-tail
            'the dog's tail; a dog-tail'                            (Métraux 1935:105)
This may be called primary possession since it is the most immediate way to express
possession and no stress is put onto either participant.
      Apart from syntactic ways there are also morphological means to mark
possession. One is the inflection with possessive -ci (cf. 4.1.2.1) which functions to
stress the possessor. In an extended meaning benefactive -taki expresses the idea that
'X exists for Y' (cf. 4.1.2.2). In this case, the beneficiary relationship between two
entities is stressed. Finally, separative -kistana is sometimes used to express a part-
whole relation in that a possessive construction with -kistana can be literally
translated as 'the X from Y' (cf. 4.1.1.5). These morphological means to express
possession may be called secondary possession since they either stress the possessor
or the possessed or mark a special relationship between the two entities.","[189, 190, 191]"

[r], [[] / [J] With respect to /r/, the sources do not provide further specification and
thus, we do not know whether <r> should represent a vibrant or a tap / flap. It is only
in Uhle's (1894) and Lehmann's (1929b, d) data that some additional explanation
occurs. Uhle (1894:1, 98) notes that /r/ is often palatalised (""mouilliert"") and thereby,
is more reminiscent of postalveolar fricative [I] than a simple vibrant163. These
descriptions possibly point into the direction of a retroflex approximant rather than a
vibrant. Lehmann (1929) uses two symbols which are <r> and <r>. In Lehmann
(1920:9), the latter is described as a prepalatal dental which is in accordance with
Schmidt (1907:862), who assigns <r> a cerebral pronounciation, which may be
equated with a postalveolar or prepalatal position. Thus, both Uhle (1894) and
Lehmann (1929) agree on a postalveolar or prepalatal /r/ which then could be
understood as either a retroflex tap or flap [ζ] or else as a retroflex approximant [ή.
However, although Uhle apparently distinguished two different sounds, he used <r>
indistinctly and therefore, we do not know which phonological environments
palatalised [r] occurs in. Lehmann's data do not demonstrate a particular distribution
of [t] or [j] and [r] but they appear in the same environment, and thus I regard [ζ] or
[j] as allophones of/r/.
     With respect to the phonological qualities of/r/, I have no definite answer due to
the lack of further specification and its classification as alveolar vibrant /r/ is in part
inspired by Cerrón-Palomino (2006:54).
     Alveolar vibrant /r/ and its allophone do not occur word initially164 (cf. Uhle
 1894:1) but appear word finally165, in a syllable's onset and its coda, and thus are pre-
consonantal or intervocalic.

However, evidence for a post-consonantal position of /r/ is rare and there is no item

Benefactive -taki in Uchumataqu is a loan from Aymara where it marks beneficiary
too; but in this function it is limited to human beings. Additionally, it also indicates a
purpose or an objective; in both these functions -taki is translated as 'for'.
      Uchumataqu adopted only the benefactive function with human beings, that is to
say: the most typical meaning of benefactive -taki. Its other function in Uchumataqu,
namely to build possessive predicate clauses like 'For me exist(s)...' is not described
for Aymara377. This use of-taki seems to be a re-interpretation extended on the basis
of its most typical meaning378.

Table 4.8: Function and meaning of benefactive -taki in Aymara and Uchumataqu
4.1.2.3 Purpose       -xapa
The nominal morpheme -xapa belongs to the case marking system of Uchumataqu
and marks purpose (PUR). It can be regarded as the counterpart to benefactive -taki
which expresses beneficiary and possession (see section 4.1.2.2) while -xapa is
restricted to marking purpose379. It is attached to verbs nominalised by infinitive -5
(45) and possibly subject relativiser -ni (see below) and nouns (46), and although
Uhle (1894) also says it is used on pronouns, no such example is available for
Uchumataqu380.
      It is to note that Vellard (1967:27) interpreted the form, which he spells -
srapam, as being verbal382. This interpretation becomes explicable if one considers
that purpose -xapa can be attached only to a nominalised verb form. The element /δ/
    Aymara also builds possessive clauses by using the verb utxa 'exist' but it does not employ benefactive
-taki in such constructions (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981154f)
378
    Uhle (1894) presents one instance in which sel- 'exist' and benefactive -laki are used to express
obligation 'It is ours to leave the house.'. This clause is built in the way possessive predicate clauses are
but clearly marks obligation. This is the only example for this usage and is considered to be exceptional.
379
    This is in contrast with Aymara and Quechua where the benefactive markers -taki and -paq,
respectively, fulfil both functions

 "" However, for Uchumataqu, Uhle (1894:52.1) mentions the interrogative pronoun cui-xapa 'for whaf'
but it occurs only as a single item, i.e. outside a clause and without further context No other researcher
notes the use of cul-xapa
381
    On some occasions also represented as -srapa.
382
    In contrast to this, Vellard (1949:177) stated that the form could be attached to nouns, verbs, and
adjectives alike.
178                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
or Isl in Vellard's inteipretation reflects the obligatory use of action nominaliser -s
before purpose -xapa. Since the form -xapa appears almost exclusively with the
action nominaliser -5 (cf. 45), Vellard (ibid.) apparently analysed Isl (or /s/) as being
part of the morpheme and therefore considered it a verbal element. However, a
problem in Vellard's data is that the form -srapa also appears twice on nouns, i.e. on
forms that do not require a nominalising morpheme. We can only assume that
Vellard, after he had analysed the form as -srapa, decided to analyse it as such in
every context, i.e. even on nouns, as in (46).(45)        haske-l         ox-cay       ma:-ki             kona      tuki    ana

There is no special form indicating negative purpose. Instead it is expressed by the
negative particle ana 'no, not' preceding the element marked by -xapa (cf. 45).
     As demonstrated above, purpose -xapa can be preceded by action nominaliser -s
which itself can be preceded by verbal markers, such as object marker -n or habitual
present tense marker -in I -ni.

However, there is only weak evidence for purpose -xapa being also preceded by
subject relativiser -ni (for purposive meaning of -ni, cf. 5.6.1) The following is the
only suitable example for this kind of usage.

possible that <c> is an alternative way to transcribe voiceless velar plosive /k/. The
same considerations may be applied for the data of Bacarreza and Posnansky, who143

present instances of <c> (example 13).

<K> Vellard uses this symbol, which he (Vellard 1949:150) defines as ""the palatal
fricative K.""146 (translation mine). This interpretation seems to be doubtful for several
reasons. First, in Vellard 1949, this symbol is not used but instead there is <K>.
Vellard does not provide a further explanation of the subscript dot but according to
Meillet and Cohen (1952:xiv), it denotes an emphatic sound. Clark and Yallop
(1995:65) point out that in Arabic emphatic sounds are velarised or pharyngealised. If
we assume that the subscript dot refers to an emphatic sound, the palatal fricative
would then result in a velar fricative [x]. In Vellard 1967, <K> is not used at all but
appears to have been replaced by simple velar plosive [k]. This possibly results from
the way <K> is employed in Vellard 1950 and 1951, where it occurs in contexts that
support a plosive reading (14). This is particularly true for glottalisation which is
impossible for a fricative and occurs only with plosives or affricates.(14)       wa.K'i            'village of Waki'           (Vellard 1950:66)
           pe.K'u.cay        '(s)he wanted'              (Vellard 1951:34)
Finally, there are inconsistencies in Vellard's data where the transcription varies
between <K> and <k> (15).

           caK' k'u.ya.-cay 'it is an old house'         (Vellard 1950:69)
Given these considerations, it seems justified to treat <K> as a plosive rather than a
fricative, despite Vellard's definition. However, since the author's definition does not
support a plosive interpretation and because Vellard appears to make a difference
between simple velar plosive <k> and <K>, I am unable to assign <K> a postion
within the Uchumataqu sound system./q/
[q] The voiceless uvular plosive is represented in the sources as <q> or <k>. It is not
found word finally nor in a coda position. Furthermore, it does not occur pre-
consonantally. Thus, /q/ is restricted to a word initial or syllable onset position, where
it can be post-consonantal.

64                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAThis restricted scope of /q/ demands some discussion. As Cerron-Palomino (2006:39)
points out with respect to /q/ ""[...] that in iru-wit'u they aymaricised it turning it into
a posterior [...]"" (translation mine)147, thus, we may assume that Uchumataqu /q/ is
the same as Aymara /q/. In Aymara, it is possible for /q/ to appear pre-consonantally
and intervocalically (Huayhua Pari 2001:70, Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981:50f). However,
as Porterie-Gutiérrez (1981:51) points out, a /q/ before consonant can be realised as
[k], i.e. it becomes velarised, which might explain why Uchumataqu /q/ does not
occur before consonants. With respect to its intervocalic position, Porterie-Gutiérrez
(1981:53) proposes for Aymara that before or after a vowel /q/ takes on a fricative
quality and is realised as [x] or [χ], respectively. If Uchumataqu /q/ is indeed of the
same quality as Aymara [q], we may assume that similar mechanisms lead to a
fricativisation of Uchumataqu /q/, which results in the loss of intervocalic [q]. These
two processes may also explain why /q/ does not appear in word final position. If e.g.
a word such as taqu 'word, language' lost its final vowel, it would result in *taq-. If
the next word began in a consonant, Iql would be pre-consonantal, which then led to
its realisation as [k]. If the following word started in a vowel, Iql would be left in
intervocalic position which would result in a fricative realisation. Although it is not
explicitly mentioned in the Uchumataqu sources, it seems possible that these two
processes also prevent Iql from appearing in a coda position.<g> In the introduction to his manuscript, Uhle (1894:1) further mentions <g> which
he specifies as follows: ""deeply guttural [...] g and q are particularly hard to
distinguish"" (translation mine).148. Example (17) demonstrates its use. However, no
other source makes note of a similar sound.

All plosives of Uchumataqu can be aspirated as well as glottalised. However, the
sources are not entirely clear about these phenomena for several reasons. First, only a
few words containing aspiration or glottalisation occur in more than one source or in
sources independent of each other, i.e. in e.g. Métraux (1935) and Vellard (1949).
Second, the authors do not always agree on whether a word is either glottalised or
aspirated, as e.g.phalni (Métraux 1935:107) andp'alne (Vellard 1950:59), 'sweat'. It
is likewise noteworthy that not every author reports phenomena of both glottalisation
and aspiration (cf. tab. 2.3).

Table 2.3: Indication of aspiration and glottalisation in the sources
Thus, at first sight it seems doubtful whether Uchumataqu has a system of aspirated
and glottalised sounds at all, or whether these are due to the language's increased
contact with Aymara (cf. Cerrón-Palomino 2006:39, footnote 4)149. However, there
are a few pairs of words that are found in different works and which display the same
phenomena (with respect to aspiration and glottalisation).
(18)       q'a                 'silver; money'                 (Uhle 1894:94.2)

           fun.eps             'father sun'                    (Métraux 1935:96)
These words are not loans and show the features in question. Thus, it is justified to
propose that Uchumataqu has a system of aspirated and glottalised plosives of its
own. However, the majority of all aspirated and glottalised sounds occur only in the
work of one author, which means that they cannot be cross-checked. Therefore, a
certain amount of uncertainty remains. It should be noted that aspirated and
glottalised plosives are more restricted with respect to the positions they can occur in
than their simple counterparts./ph/

149
    A similar observation has been made by Willem Adelaar (personal communication) He proposes that
the features of glottalisation and aspiration may spread from one language (providing language) into
another language (borrowing language), where they eventually may receive phoneme status.

Similar to its non-glottalised counterpart, /k'/ occurs word finally only in case of final

"3.4.1 Nominal compounding
Accordig to Bauer (2006:719), ""[a] compound is usually defined [...] as a word that is
made up of two other words.""289. As elaborated in the literature, it is somewhat
problematic to distinguish compounds from phrases, since both are the result of
combining independent items into larger, meaningful units (cf. Anderson 1985:40).
Several criteria help to identify compounds, including phonological peculiarities and
particularly the stress pattern, but as outlined in chapter 2, these measures are less
reliable for Uchumataqu. However, morphophonological processes, such as the use
of linking elements or elision of the final vowel may indicate whether an item is
perceived as one word or two. Linking elements often indicate clearly that the object
is indeed a compound, but elision of final vowels is frequent in Uchumataqu and
therefore can never be the single criterion for establishing compounds. With respect
to morphology, we find that inflection occurs only on the last element of a compound
(cf. Bauer 2006:723) and thus, an item such as kot' suni-naka 'the Uru people'
(Vellard 1967:3) can be interpreted as a compound290. Another means of establishing
  Anderson (1985 40) points out that a compound can consist of more than two words.
  Please note that this claim receives additional support by the elision of final /a/ on kola 'lake'.
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                   139
compounds is their syntactic behaviour, i.e. since compounds form a single part of
speech, they syntactically behave as any other member of this class and occupy an
appropriate position (e.g. clause initial in case the compound is a noun functioning as
a subject). As will be shown with greater detail in chapter 7, Uchumataqu has a
relatively free word order, and although it is in principle SOV, nearly every word
order is possible and thus, the position an item can take does not provide much
evidence. However, if an item occurs repeatedly as a unit in the sources and its
components are never split up by other constitutents (as is the case with kot ' sum),
then it is likely to be a compound. The last criteria to be mentioned are semantic: the
""degree of lexicalised meaning"" and the ""degree of compositionality"" (Anderson
1985:44). The meaning of a compound is often more than the sum of its parts and
lexicalised. Consider (28):(28)       p-cincu     kara
           bird        hand
           'wing'                                                (Lehmann 1929b: 1)
In establishing compounds on a semantic base, I interpret those items as compounds
that occur with some frequency in the sources291 and / or whose meaning is non-
compositional. This is not without obstacles, either: an item still documented in e.g.
Uhle (1894) may be already lost in e.g. Métraux (1935) although it was lexicalised.
In some cases, the sources offer divergent translations for the same item, which can
make the status of the item in question doubtful. In other cases, the appearance of an
object is that of a compound but with respect to semantics, a lexicalised meaning is
less likely, as demonstrated in example (29).
(29)       tuxsfaj kuya-cay
           foreign house-DEC
           'it is a house of others; an Aymara house292 (Vellard 1967:7)
Example (29) shows an object which at first sight could be understood as a
compound since two words follow each other immediately and inflection (i.e.
declarative -cay) occurs on the second component. However, with respect to
frequency of use, it is less likely that an expression such as this would have become
lexicalised and furthermore, it is compositional and thus, instances such as example
(29) are not regarded as compounds293.1 would like to point out that for establishing
compounds I rely mainly on semantic criteria, which can be supported by
morphophonological, morphological, and syntactic findings.
     Uchumataqu makes frequent use of compounding, particularly with kinship
terms and body parts. Uchumataqu compounds can be understood as consisting of a
head and its modifier, the head being nominal whereas the modifier can be another
noun, an adjective, or an adverb. The order is modifier-head. Consider (30) to (32):
2,1
   Which points to their lexicalised status.
292
   tuxsa means 'foreign' but is mainly used to denote the Aymara people.
293
   Another semantic test for the compound status are paraphrases (Anderson 1985 42). However, this
cannot be tested since the sources do not offer periphrastic descriptions (in Uchumataqu) for compounds.

The following is an instance of an adverb functioning as a modifier.

           'cousin'                                                (Métraux 1935:94)
The parts of speech used in Uchumataqu compounds are nouns, adjectives, and
adverbs295 and the resulting compounds are either nouns or adjectives. Thus,
Uchumataqu compounds can be sketched as follows296: [N/Adj/Adv-N]N/Adj
     The majority of the resulting compounds is endocentric (see examples 30 to 32),
while only a minor part is exocentric (see examples 33 and 34).

In all but one case, the components are simply juxtaposed and often, the final vowel
of the modifier is deleted (e.g. example 33). Example (35) is the only instance where
a linking element -/ is used.
(35)        haqe-l-taqe
            person-LK-totality,297

As will be further discussed in chapter 4, the use of haqeltaqe in Uchumataqu is
uncertain and if it is indeed lexicalised, it possibly originates from Aymara haqe
'person, human being' and take 'totality' (DeLucca 1983:161, 397). If this analysis is
true, then the Uchumataqu speakers borrowed both components from Aymara,
'glued' them together by means of linking element -/, and derived a new meaning for
the resulting item.
     Apart from this, there are cases which seem to be compounds but one of their
components does not occur independently (cf. Payne 1997:93f)· Therefore, its2.4
    The hyphe in lussi 'leg' does not mark a morpheme boundary but can be interpreted as marking a

meaning and the word class it belongs to remain uncertain. An example is the word
for 'hunger' ceri s-tuk-29* (see tab. 3.3). It appears in all sources, is completely
lexicalised, and translations agree on that it means 'hunger; to be hungry'. The first
component is known as ceri 'stomach' but tuk does not occur as an independent
lexical item299. It is even doubtful whether ceri s-tuk- (regardless of the spelling) can
be considered a compound since the element -s (or *-) is reminiscent of third person
clitic - j , which always occurs word initially or finally. If this is true, then the
expression for 'hunger' consists of two lexical items.","[155, 156, 157, 158]"

Sometimes the subject is expressed overtly but the tendency is for the predicate to
appear alone. If the subject occurs, it is often marked by topic marker -ki and can
precede or follow the predicate; no preference for either position can be established.

A significant feature of existential predicate clauses (cf. Payne 1997:112) is the
obligatory use of the copulative verb sel- 'to be' which always carries declarative -
cay, while the predicate either takes topic marker -ki (59) or is not marked at all (60),
although this happens only exceptionally.

Locational predicate clauses predicate over the location of an entity. Thus, the
morphological feature of this predication type is the application of nominal locative
marking morphology, such as directional locative -kis, locative -fcy/ (62), and
postpositions which follow the subject (63). Although the locational predicate can
take declarative -cay, this happens only exceptionally (63).","[298, 299]"

5.7.1 Gerund -ku
Gerund -ku marks the same subject for dependent and independent verb forms and is
best translated by English gerund -ing. In accordance with that, it expresses
simultaneousness.
(92)        am cer-ku txas-txas-u-cay
            you see-GER laugh-laugh-1SG-DEC
            'Seeing you (sg), I laugh [and] laugh.'                           (Uhle 1894:94.2)
(93)        tiki-cay kwas-na521 k'ap-ku
            die-DEC water-LOC sink-GER
            '(S)he died, sinking into the water.'                             (Vellard 1967:4)Gerund -ku is the only element that can be attached to a subordinate verb form528 and
the use of declarative -cay is prohibited on the subordinate form.
     We find gerund -ku attached to action, motion, and cognition verbs and we may
therefore assume that there is no restriction with respect to verb class. Gerund -ku is
not selected by a specific verb or verb class in the matrix position.
      In most cases, the subordinate verb precedes the independent verb, as in
examples (92) and (94), although there are a few exceptions (cf. 93).
     Person reference is expressed either by the use of a subject or subject pronoun or
is otherwise indicated on the verb itself, as in (92) and (94).

The form -na, and its possible variant -an, is found only three times, so the database
on which the following statements are based is severely limited. Furthermore, the
clauses that contain -na are not entirely clear and it may be possible that -na does not
mark subordination at all. However, if we assume that -na is used for subordination,
then it expresses switch reference (glossed as SWR) combined with non-
simultaneousness, i.e. the action expressed by the -«α-marked verb form still has to
happen.(95)        tukunwa tiks-na tacikni litrai     ceri-s-n-a-cay
            woman die-SWR portrait             see-SU-OB2-FU-DEC

    Aymara locative form, cf 4 1 1 2 and 4 1.13 Person reference is based on Vellard's translation
528
    In fact, there are two instances in which -ku is preceded by the elements -n; and -na and once, it is
followed by an element -/ Since these cases are not entirely clear, I will treat them as misinterpretations
529
    The word hap- 'to run' is found only in Vellard's work ( 1949-67)
!ï0
    The expression litrai is a loan from Spanish retrato 'portrait' However, the form tacikni remains
uncertain, particularly since Vellard (1949 186, translation mine) himself does not provide a further
analysis but only points out ""I am myself not absolutely sure about the transcription of tiks' na-tacikni, it
is a future form of die, meaning 'the one strechted out"".(""Je ne suis pas absolument sûr de la transcription
de liks' na-tacikni; c'est une forme future de mort, littéralement 'qui est étendu"" )
238                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAThe potential alternative form -an appears only once and there, an interpretation as
verb stem plus object marker -n is possible, too. The translation is based on Métraux
(ibid).
(96)        //' soni        luxl-s-ka-ra     tiks-t-in-cay  luli
            this man        eat-SU?-lC-DT531 die-RES-SR-DEC food
            cuki on-an-ki
            let_us give-swR-TOP
            'This man is nearly starved to death, let's give him food.'
                                                                    (Métraux 1935:97)
The form -an in example (96) is followed by Topic marker -ki, the use of which is
selected by the personal pronoun cuki 'let us'. But even if a clausal element such as
Topic marker -ki can appear on a subordinate verb form, we may assume that the use
of declarative -cay is impossible on a verb subordinated by -an or -na. According to
the examples (95) and (96), no morphemes precede the forms -an or -na.
      The limited database on switch reference subordination markers does not allow
any statement about potential verb class restrictions532, normal word order, or the
distribution of pronominal and clitic elements. With respect to the latter, we may
assume that the use of subjects or subject pronouns is obligatory should -na indeed
mark switch reference. This requirement is fulfilled for examples (95) and (96).
      It seems likely that particularly in its last stage Uchumataqu employed a
coordination strategy rather than switch reference subordination. In examples (97)
and (98), we find simple declarative clauses533 joined by coordination, each
containing its own subject or subject pronoun.

531
    -ka is glossed as incompletive (IC), -ra as distributive (DT) (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981 208, 281). If Ihis
interpretation is true, both elements are from Aymara origin, although it is not entirely certain whether the
assumption is accurate.
 52
    The three potential instances of -na I -an occur on cognition, action-process, and factive verbs If the
proposed interpretation of-na / -an is correct, the distribution does not point to a restriction with respect to
verb class
53)
    The end of a clause is indicated by declarative -cay (underlined).
"" 4 As indicated in the glosses cerk means 'to see, look' According to Vellard, it is translated here as 'to
wait for'.

5.7.3 Chain verb constructions
What may be understood as a kind of subcategory to subordination are the so-called
chain verb constructions (cf. Muysken 2001:108). The matrix verb is often the
volition verb pek- 'to want' and the complement verb is zero marked, i.e. it consists
of the verb stem alone. Although two different actions (e.g. 'want' and 'eat') are
expressed, these are closely related, as can also be seen by word order, where the
complement verb immediately precedes the matrix verb (cf. chapter 7.8.2).

If at all, chain verb constructions come closest to what could be described as
coreferential and non-simultaneous, although there are counterexamples such as
(101), which is simultaneous.

With respect to verb class, we find chain verb constructions involving action,
cognition, utterance, and motion verbs537. Although the database is limited, we may
assume that there is no restriction with regard to verb class. As in simple declarative
clauses, person reference is expressed mainly by the use of a subject or subject
pronoun, the latter one is frequently inflected with a subject clitic (cf. 99 and 100).","[253, 254, 255, 256]"
"6.1.1 Temporal adverbs
Among the group of adverbs that signal temporal modification we find the following
expressions:
twrnxe™                         'today'
sesko                           'yesterday'
haqa or haqa winsi              'tomorrow'
maxena                          'early day'
wiya56*                         'night'
yasi                            'now'
nikstani569                     'afterwards, then'
wina or wir(i)wina510           'afterwards'
yam tuku                        'not yet'
hiya or his                     'still'.
Some temporal adverbs consist of lexical compounds, such as haqa winsi
'tomorrow'or yam tuku 'not yet' whose constituents can be explained only in part.
The component winsi of haqa winsi 'tomorrow' never occurs on its own and
therefore, nothing can be said about its exact meaning or the semantic impact it has.
The same is true for yam of yam tuku 'not yet'. Sometimes there are alternative
forms, as e.g. hiya or his 'still' but the difference between these forms has also to
remain uncertain.
     Temporal adverbs belong to those adverbs that behave nominally, i.e. they can
be inflected with nominal suffixes (see example 1). However, at least yasi 'now' can
take the adjectival predicator -kasi (cf. example 2 and chapter 4.3.2).

                                                          (Vellard 1949:162)

The expression yasi 'now' is the only example of a temporal adverb that takes
predicator -kasi. Thus, it has to be regarded as an exception from the general567
      The spelling of this forni differs considerably
' 6 * It is uncertain whether the stem is wiya or wiyam. Inflection points into the direction of wiya.
"" ί , The use of separative -k[i]slam is lexicahsed here. The change of final vowel /a/ to l\I possibly reflects
the use of a dummy element.
570
      win itself means 'anus' but can be used to designate anything which is somewhere at the back.
571
      puka probably derives from aymara phokana 'completar / [ ] cumplir' (DeLucca 1983 352) as does
resultalive -la (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981 117). Vellard ( 1951:13) points to that.

morphological coding pattern and the use of predicator -kasi does not appear to be
obligatory, as demonstrated in example (3) (for further discussion, see 6.1.6).

            'We launch the balsa raft now.'                          (Vellard 1949:155)
As mentioned above, temporal adverbs can take nominal morphemes (except yasi) as
well as clausal clitics, such as topic marker -ki, declarative -cay, affirmative -pini, or
clitic elements. However, in most cases, they are not inflected at all.

temporal adverbs which are tonx 'today' andjOsz' 'now'.
(5)         tonx paca             as[-]paca
            today INT             now[-]iNT
            'even today'          'now'
            ('aujourd'hui même'1) (lmaintenant,)                     (Métraux 1935:91,100)
These are the only instances where the form (-)paca occurs with temporal adverbs
which provides a small basis for any conclusive statements. However, it seems that
with the expression tonx paca 'even today' a sense of urgency or intensification is
included. Cerrón-Palomino (2006:179, translation mine) observes an identical suffix
for Chipaya which the author labels ""puntualizador"" and describes as follows: ""[...]
the morpheme -paca imprints a sense of urgency or irreplacable pressure on the
situation or event expressed by the phrase to which it is added.""574 I would like to
adopt this definition of-paca and will call the morpheme intensifier (INT). However,
the severly limited database on the form -paca prevents further statements on other
functions or kinds of usage as well as on the type of suffix -paca presents, i.e.
whether it is a nominal, adjectival, or clausal marker. However, it may be well related
to either the Aymara or Quechua word paca which in both languages means 'time'
(DeLucca 1983:328, Lira 1944:720)575.","[269, 270]"
"7.1 Clausal and personal clitics
""A clitic is a bound morpheme that functions at a phrasal or clausal level, but which
binds phonologically to some other word, known as the host."" (Payne 1997:22,
markings by the author). Clitics are not bound to a specific clause types, but are
nonetheless crucial for the analysis and interpretation of Uchumataqu clause types.
Therefore, these clitic elements will be introduced before I discuss Uchumataqu
clause types.
      Uchumataqu has two sets of clitic elements: the first set consists of the clausal
clitics affirmative -pini, declarative -cay, and topic marker -ki, while the second set
comprises the personal clitics -/, -m, and -5 (first, second, and third person). Before I
describe these elements, I will discuss the ground on which they can be termed
clitics. I follow Zwicky and Pullum (1983:503ff) for this discussion. According to the
authors, six criteria establish the clitic nature of an element. These criteria will be
examined for their truth value of the Uchumataqu clitic elements.
      The first criterion for clitichood is that clitics show ""a low degree of selection
with respect to their host."" (Zwicky and Pullum 1983:503). This requirement is met
by clausal clitics since they can occur on every part of speech without any restriction.
(1)        ninaka lik-cay
           they     drink-DEC
           'They drink.'                                         (Métraux 1935:92)

           'Now, I will go to the house.'            (Vellard 1967:20)
The same is true for personal clitics. Please consider examples (3) and (4).
(3)        heki aka winsi-s   pit-[a]c[a]-aki
           who tomorrow-CL=3 come-lR-FU
           'Who will come tomorrow?'                             (Vellard 1967:15)
(4)        tomxe-ki       ana-l          t(a)xa-cay wir-ki
           today-TOP NEG-CL=1            sleep-DEC      I-TOP
           'Today, I did not sleep.'601                          (Uhle 1894:12b)
The second criterion is that there ""are no arbitrary gaps in the set of host-clitic
combinations - no cases where a PARTICULAR host word fails to combine with [...]
 "" Temporal relationship expressed in the example is based on Uhle.
268                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
clitics."" (Zwicky and Pullum 1983:504, marking by the authors). This is a logical
consequence of the first criterion, since the clausal as well as the personal clitics
appear on every morpheme combination, either nominal, verbal, or attributive (cf.
examples 1 to 4). That is, there is no rule which forbids the combination of either of
these elements with e.g. a verb inflected with past tense 1 -u.
      The third criterion concerns phonology: ""[...] no cases where a particular host-
clitic combination shows an unexpected phonological form. Hosts are unaffected by
these clitics, and the clitics themselves have allomorphs distributed by general rules
referring to phonological and morphological properties of the host."" (Zwicky and
Pullum 1983:505). The application of one (or more) of the clausal clitics does not
change phonological or morphological properties the host602 (5), and only in some
rare cases is the final stem vowel deleted.

Personal clitics -/, -m, -s never cause the deletion of a stem or final vowel. If either of
them is to occur between two consonants, a linking vowel is inserted, resulting in
either -/-/' / -/-/, -m-i /-i-m, or -s-i I -is.

           {'aminpica')                                  (Métraux 1935:109)
A further syntactic criterion of Zwicky and Pullum (1983:505f) is that ""[s]yntactic
rules can affect affixed words, but cannot affect clitic groups. [...], no syntactic
operations exist which treat a word combined with one of the clitics [...] as a unit.""
This criterion cannot be applied to the clausal clitics. Affirmative -pini, declarative
-cay, and topic marker -ki have fixed positions following all other nominal or verbal
markers and cannot change positions among each other or with any of their preceding
suffixes. That is, they are bound to an enclitic position. In contrast, the personal
clitics -/, -m, -s have the freedom to occur in a pro- as well as enclitic position (8) and
thus, never form a fixed unit with their host the way an affix does. Furthermore, there
are examples that suggest that -/, -m, -s are able to split up compounds (9).

          'We go hunting fish in the new balsa raft.' (Vellard 1949:155)
Two last criteria listed by Zwicky and Pullum (1983:504, 505) are: ""[...] no cases
where the contribution of these clitics to sentence meaning is not identical to the
conribution of their associated full forms."", and further: ""Clitics can attach to material
already containing clitics, but affixes cannot."". With respect to first criterion, the
personal clitic of second person -m is reminiscent of the personal pronoun am 'you'
and could be derived from the personal pronoun. However, apart from this, the clitic
elements of Uchumataqu do not develop from contractions of otherwise full forms
and thus, this criterion cannot be applied to Uchumataqu. With respect to the second
requirement, we find that declarative -cay and topic marker -ki are mutually exclusive
but it is well possible for declarative -cay to follow affirmative -pini (10). No
instance is found where -pini is followed by topic marker -ki. Affirmative -pini can
be also combined with personal clitics (11), although this is rather exceptional.
Among each other, the personal clitics are mutually exclusive due to the person
reference they express. No other nominal, adjectival, or verbal morpheme can follow
after a member of the sets of clitics has been attached. With that, the final criterion of
Zwicky and Pullum is fulfilled.(10)      ana-pini-cay hoxk-aca-cay

In sum, of the six criteria named by Zwicky and Pullum for the establishment of
clitics, four are fulfilled by all of the forms discussed here, while a fifth (the syntactic
criterion) is fulfilled only by the personal clitics. A final criterion cannot be examined
due to language specific features, i.e. the lack of adjacent full forms. However, I
regard the results of the preceding discussion satisfying enough to label -pini, -cay,
and -ki as well as -/, -m, and -5 clitic elements605.","[284, 285, 286]"

218                          UCHUMATAQU : THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA

           '(S)he / it sank down into the water.'              (Vellard 1951:30)
With respect to the translation of the past tense forms, the sources differ remarkably
and no meaningful distinction between -u and -ku is made. Therefore, I propose as a
general translation simple past tense. In the glosses, the past tense markers are
distinguished by PSTl for -u and PST2 for -ku. However, some forms suggest that -u
marks a recent past with some connection to present tense (cf. Vellard 1951:371). We
sometimes find -u used with adverbs that relate to a recent past tense, as in the
following example.
(26)       sesku       s(i)kisiki wes-u-cay
           yesterday skin-skin remove-PSTl-DEC
           'Yesterday, I removed the skins.'   (Métraux 1935:96)
We also find a form -u in present tense, although there it is limited to first person
singular. Thus, it is possible that -u is more closely related to the present tense than
-ku, which is often found designating events that have a sense of finality or which are
irreversible (25, 26).
(27)        ni     tiks-ku-cay
            (s)he die-PST2-DEC
            '(S)hedied.'                                          (Vellard 1951:25)
The distribution of pronominal elements and clitics is similar to that of the present
tense. In the majority of cases where -u and -ku are used484, neither subject or subject
pronoun nor subject clitics appear and only the verb marked for past occurs (cf. 25,
26). In such cases, context must contribute to the person reference. However, if
person reference is expressed, it is done mainly by the application of the subject or
subject pronoun (cf. 22, 23). As in present tense, clitic elements play only a minor
role and hardly ever contribute to person reference alone.
     The application of -u and -ku is not obligatory since there are clauses which are
zero marked for tense, or in which a temporal dimension is indicated by the use of
temporal adverbs alone, cf. (28).
(28)        sesku       asini suni ox-cay
            yesterday ill       man go-DEC
            'Yesterday, an ill man went.'                         (Vellard 1967:13)
According to a paradigm provided by Vellard (1951:371), the form -cu is an
allomorph of PST2 marker -ku. This cannot be verified by the data, and neither can
the use of a form -(i)ki, which according to Vellard (ibid.) marks a very distant past
tense.   -na is an Aymara locative marker. Person reference is based on Vellard's translation.

   Elicitated phrases (found e g in Vellard 1951) are excluded here since they do not represent a natural

5.7.5 Future tense markers -a / -aki
The future tense markers -a I -aki are attached to all verb classes. The form -a is used
exclusively for first person singular, whereas -aki appears on the other persons
(second person singular-third person plural).
(29)        wir-i-l       tapa         lul-a(-cay)
            I-LV-CL=1     pepper       eat-FU-DEC
            'I will eat pepper.'                                  (Métraux 1935:100)

            ""Whom will you go fishing cisi with?' (Uhle 1894:94.1)
Future tense markers -a I -aki denote a close as well as a more distant future tense, as
in (31 ), although verb semantics often point into the direction of a near or immediate
future tense (cf. example 35). This observation is strengthened by the use of temporal
adverbs which refer to an immediate future (32). Therefore, the future tense markers
are generally translated as 'will' when an unspecified future is expressed, or 'going
to' when an immediate future is signalled. Sometimes an exhortative is implied, too,
as demonstrated in (32)485 (cf. 5.8.1). It is worth mentioning that we find only a first
person plural inclusive employed with -aki, but never a first person plural exclusive.

            'If during this year there will be enough water, we will be [= live].'
                                                          (Vellard 1949:152)
(32)       yasse cukfij     okwfaj-aki-cay    am kui-kina
           now let_us       go-FU-DEC         you house-DlR
           'Now, we are going to go to your house.' (free translation: 'Now, let us go
           to your house.')                           (Vellard 1967:20)
Although in the majority of cases the distinction between -a for first person singular
and -aki for second person singular to third person plural is upheld, we sometimes
find deviations from that pattern. Thus, a first person singular occurs with -aki (33),
while first person plural inclusive and third person singular are used with -a. These
cases are not entirely clear and no explanation can be provided. However, the
majority of the data support the interpretation given above486.
(33)        wir-ki cap-aki-cay
            I-TOP     pinch-FU-DEC
            'I will pinch.'                                       (Vellard 1951:31)48!
    This phenomenon is observed for Aymara and Quechua as well
'"""" In modem Chipaya we find a similar distinction. There, -a is used for both first person singular and
plural whereas -aki marks future tense on all other persons. However, no such deviation as mentioned here
exists in Chipaya, i.e. a first person always must take -a.
220                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
With respect to the distribution of pronominal and clitic elements487, in most cases
neither the subject nor a subject pronoun or a subject clitic appear. Except for first
person singular, person reference is uncertain in these cases and must be provided by
the context. If person reference is expressed, we find a subject or subject pronoun
employed and only in the minority of the data, a subject clitic is additionally attached
to a subject pronoun (there, mostly with first person singular). Clitic elements alone
hardly ever contribute to person reference.
     Although in most cases -a I -aki are attached directly to the verb stem, they can
be preceded by several suffixes, such as irrealis -aca (34, 35).

Declarative -cay is the only suffix that follows the future tense markers which shows
that -a I -aki belong to the last verbal elements attached to a verb. No derivations,
short or alternative forms of -a or -aki are encountered.","[234, 235, 236, 237]"
"2.13.1 Syllable patterns of Uchumataqu
A syllable can be defined as consisting ""of a vocalic peak, which may be
accompanied by a consonantal onset or coda"" (Clark and Yallop 1995:67). In  The form -ske is an alternative of -ski (cf. example 200).
  Uhle does not specify whether this item originates from Uchumataqu or Chipaya.
CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY                                                                         115
accordance with this definition we find the following syllable patterns in
Uchumataqu
(201)        V          aca              'head'               (Métraux 1935 108)

(207)        CVCC       liks-            'to drink'           (Métraux 1935 92)
A vowel as syllable peak cannot take more than three consonants, ι e either two
consonants in the onset and one in the coda or vice versa There is no lexeme that
consists of a single vowel, although Uchumataqu has syllabic vowels, as represented
in example (201) (cf Cerrón-Palomino 2006 63) Syllables of the type V, CV, and
CCV are open, in contrast to syllables of the types VC, CVC, CCVC, and CVCC,
which are closed Except for CVCC and CCVC syllables, the syllables have one
mora Syllables of the type CVCC and CCVC have two morae as do syllables whose
nucleus consist of a complex vowel sequence Those syllables are open Please
consider examples (208) and (209)(208)        VV          au na ca        'to wet (somebody or something)'
                                                           (Uhle 1894 102)

The syllable pattern of Uchumataqu can be therefore sketched as follows
((C)C)V(V)(C(C)) The most common syllable patterns are CV and CVC, although
Uchumataqu has a tendency to have word initial consonant clusters, in the way of
CCVC (see also example 206 and 2 2 3) However, the following instances of

the only ones attested Therefore, I regard them as exceptions

Example (211) is the only item which displays the otherwise impossible pattern of
CCVCC, which is due to the preceding object marker s- Although it is not reflected
in the translation, the use of object marker s- suggests a transitive reading '(s)he cuts

find that verbs are either mono- or bisyllabic, whereas nouns can have up to three

30                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Uhle stayed in Irohito between 23rd August and lsl September 1894 (Uhle 1894 m.s.
Chronologie meiner Erfahrungen57:!) and for all we know, this was his only visit to
the community. He does not provide the name of his language consultant but only
refers to him as ""at least one who taught me his language, in spite of his fellows""58
(Uhle 1896:19, translation mine). That is, the Uchumataqu data collected by Uhle
stem from one single speaker and except for the fact that he was male nothing further
is said about him. Neither does Uhle specify the personal relationship to his language
consultant, although he twice mentions him as his ""teacher"" (Uhle 1894:3, 89.1).
However, we do not know whether he refers to his visit to Irohito or Huachacalla.
      With respect to his language skills, Max Uhle spoke Spanish but probably
hardly any Aymara59 at the time he visited Irohito and it was only after his trip to
Irohito that Uhle became more acquainted with Aymara (cf. Rowe 1954:106).
Although he mentions an interpreter for his studies on Chipaya (Uhle 1896:331)60,
we find no unequivocal hint to an interpreter for his trip to Irohito. Only once does
Uhle (1894:82, translation mine) remark upon ""an interpreter speaking a second
Indian language""61 but it remains uncertain whether he refers to his study on Chipaya
or Uchumataqu. However, it seems justified to assume that Uhle was dependent upon
an interpreter in Irohito as well. Thus, the languages used in the process of data
collection must have been Uchumataqu, Aymara, and Spanish.
      The Uchumataqu data have never been published and are thus available only as
a manuscript, which, as part of Uhle's academic legacy, is in the possession of the
Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin. The manuscript is handwritten in what is
today an old-fashioned script called Siitterlin and with a few exceptions Uhle uses
German throughout his notes.
      The part of the manuscript that is of importance here is the grammar of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya called ""Basic outline of an Uro grammar"" (Grundzüge
einer Uro-Grammatik). It consists of 117 single and double pages, some of which are
not numbered, in which case I cite them as e.g. 64.1. Here, 64 refers to the last page
number Uhle used, while . 1 indicates that it is the first unnumbered page after this;
correspondingly, 64.2 would refer to the second unnumbered page following p. 64.
      Although the first section in Uhle's manuscript is about the language of Irohito,
the manuscript itself is concerned with both varieties, i.e. Uhle treats Uchumataqu
and Chipaya and melts them into one grammatical description. He often indicates
where he obtained a particular piece of information from or which variety a statement
refers to, but does not consistently do so. In some cases, he points to differences
between the two varieties. However, Uhle deals with every aspect of the language
and his manuscript is thus an entire grammar of Uru-Chipaya. Although Uhle
collected a considerable number of sentences and more than 600 words in Irohito
 (Uhle 1896:19), his grammar does not contain texts but single sentences. These are
transcribed according to the phonological transcription conventions of Uhle's time

(cf. chapter 2) and therefore the data convey not only grammatical but also
phonological information. As it was common in the late 19th century, Uhle used a
Latin-based model for his grammar, which particularly with respect to the verbal
system led to a certain frustration on the researcher's part:
        While recording the language I tried several times to conjugate a short verbal
        phrase through the different tenses but all I got was that with every person I
        received an entirely new tense changing the entire meaning of the sentence,
        [...]. Particularly the answers on tense were always the most unsatisfactory.
        Some of these answers I had to correct by cross-checking two, three times but
        did not always succeed. (Uhle 1894:84, translation mine)62
Uhle also compares his results to Aymara referring to the grammar of Middendorf
(1891), observing similarities and differences and repeatedly pointing to the
increasing Aymara influence on Uchumataqu.
     From Uhle's difficulties to describe the verbal system a certain bias results
towards the nominal and pronominal system of the language: it is by far the most
elaborate section and an almost complete description of the nominal and pronominal
aspects of Uru-Chipaya. In comparison, the verbal system is less detailed and as
indicated in the quotation above, Uhle is concerned mainly with the tense system,
while he is less interested in e.g. aspectual features. Furthermore, most of the data
exemplifying the verbal system seem to come from Chipaya. Other parts of the
language are treated equally briefly, e.g. postpositions, clausal markers, and adverbs.
Each of these topics receives only a few pages' treatment. In the following I give a
rough sketch of the contents of the grammar. The numbering is mine.

minor degree.

We find personal notes and comments made by Uhle throughout his manuscript.
Some of them were clearly made while collecting the data, whereas others were
probably added afterwards. They enable us to get an insight into the way Uhle
obtained and treated his information, something he himself does not further specify.
Thus, Uhle reports the expression tsi: wa.sa 'once' but remarks: ""The Indian gave me
tsi u.nu, but u.nu is probably Spanish WHO!""68 (Uhle 1894:33, translation mine). That
is, Uhle does not use the expression his language consultant provided but what he65
   Which is expressed by the copulative verb sel - 'to be' and benefactive -taki
66
   These clauses are repeated from his grammar
67
   Since Polo visited Irohito in 1897, it seems that this list must have been added some time after Uhle
returned from South America

considered to be appropriate. It is not unlikely that this happened with other entries,
too, even if Uhle does not mark them as 'corrected'. A similar process can be
observed with the use of parenthesis, as e.g. on -kin(a) 'to, towards' (Uhle 1894:11).
Although Uhle does not explain when and why he uses parenthesis, it is likely that
they mark elements that were not realised due to e.g. elision but which Uhle
considers to be necessary.
     When it comes to an evaluation of the manuscript, we have to take into
consideration that Uhle spent only a short time in Irohito, worked only with one
language consultant, whose background remains unknown, he probably needed an
interpreter speaking Aymara and Spanish, and possibly changed some of his data to
what he considered appropriate. However, despite these restrictions Uhle's work can
be regarded as one of the most important documents on Uchumataqu. Not only was
he the first researcher ever to collect any linguistic data, but he also documented
Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already endangered. His
description of the nominal and pronominal system is supported by following works
and even modem studies on the closely related Chipaya (cf. Cerrón-Palomino 2006)
confirm his findings. In conclusion, Uhle's manuscript contains highly valuable
information on Uchumataqu.","[46, 47, 48, 49, 50]"
"5.1 Tense marking suffixes
Uchumataqu has a tense system which may be a future / non-future-system although
there are markers for present, past, and future tense. The markers for simple present
and past tense 1 resemble each other more than those for future and simple present
tense (cf. table 5.1). Furthermore, a verb in present457 and past tense can be zero
marked for tense, which is rare for future tense.
      It is only for future and simple present tense that a person distinction is made,
i.e. first person singular is marked differently from all other persons which receive
the same marking, habitual present tense, past tense 1 and 2 may be viewed as having
some aspectual notion to them, due to their lack of person marking (see also 5.2.2).
With regard to the distribution of pronominal and clitic elements, the tenses behave
similarly. The two strategies employed most often are either no marking at all or the
use of a subject or subject pronoun. If neither a subject or subject pronoun nor a
subject clitic is used, we must assume that context contributes to person reference.
However, the first person sg is always clearly marked and very often there is double
or triple marking. In this case, a subject clitic is attached to a subject pronoun, and in
present or future tense the verb takes -u or -a, respectively. In general, clitic elements
do not establish person reference by themselves. The tense markers are applied
disregarding verb class.458Person          Future tense Simple                 Habitual             Past tense I     Past tense II

   In simple present tense, this is the usual way to express any person other than first person singular

   Although future and present tense in Uchumataqu are nearly identical to Chipaya, the varieties differ to
some degree in past tense marking Uchumataqu does not have the Chipaya -ci paradigm, which does not
only express past tense but also person reference and gender distinction Furthermore, Uchumataqu uses
the resultative-/faj in a different manner as well
212                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
5.1.1 Simple present tense -u and 0
In the Uchumataqu simple present tense, the first person singular is obligatorily
marked by -u (1). For second person singular to third person plural no verbal markers
exist, so there we only find the verbal stem (2)460.

            (7cA will gleich Geld geben.' Now, I want to give money.)
                                                                (Uhle 1894:94.2)

            'The sail fills out, (it is a) great, strong wind.' (Vellard 1949:162)
It is noteworthy that the verbal phrases of first person singular found in Vellard 1951
do not contain the first person singular marker -u (3) and it is only in entire clauses
that the marker occurs (4). No definite explanation can be given for this, but we may
assume that Vellard wishes to present an infinitive form by deleting the first person
singular marker -u.
(3)         wir taxe-cay
            I     sleep-DEC
            'I sleep.'                                                 (Vellard 1951:25)

            'I want [= love] you very much, white man.'                (Vellard 1951:21)
There are some more cases in Métraux (1935) and the work of Vellard (1949-67)
where -u is missing, but those instances are not entirely clear and very often an
interpretation as another person is possible, too (5).
(5)         wist kui-kina     pit-cay
            my house-DiR come-DEC
            'You, (s)he,... come(s) from my house.'
            (To vengo de casa. ')                                       (Vellard 1967:20)
The first person singular marker -u can be preceded by subject marker -s (3, 4) and
object marker -n (4) (cf. 5. 2. 3).
(6)         wir-i-l     tusa                  pa:-s-u(-cay)

   The following statements are restricted to declarative clauses since verbs in interrogative or imperative
clauses behave differently (cf. 7 5 and 7 6).
460
   In Chipaya, -u also serves to mark a first person plural inclusive. However, this is not attested for
Uchumataqu; instead, a first person plural inclusive is unmarked. In Métraux's work (1935) we find some
instances of a first person plural inclusive indicated with -u, but those cases are not entirely clear
Therefore, I consider -u strictly limited to first person singular
CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM                                                                            213(7)         wilk espejo-ta       wils      yuk cir-s-n-u-cay

            'I see my face in the mirror.'               (Muysken 2005:56)
Since second person singular to third person plural have no marker of their own, no
preceding suffixes can be listed462. The only morpheme that frequently follows verbs
in the simple present tense is declarative -cay, although this is not a rule because in a
few instances it is attached to other constituents as well. When -cay is not used, the
verb is completely unmarked (except for first person singular where -u is attached).
     Although the example clauses are translated as simple present, semantics and /
or pragmatics point into the direction of actions or events happening at the moment
of speech (e.g. examples 1, 2, 6, 7). That is, these actions or events do not take place
over an extended period of time but are restricted in their temporal scope to the
moment of speaking and are therefore seen as conveying a progressive meaning
The following two examples contain a progressive form in their translation.

            ('VOMÌ êtes en train de manger'')                        (Métraux 1935:100)
General existential statements are formed with the copulative verb sel 'to be'.

            'There areno women here.'465          (Métraux 1935:91)
Since except for first person singular, person reference is not indicated on the verb,
the use of pronouns and clitics should be important to the understanding of a clause.
For second person singular to third person plural it is most common to find a subject
or subject pronoun before the verb, but the use of a subject clitic is exceptional. The
most common way to mark first person singular is to attach -u to the verb, which
itself is preceded by a subject pronoun which bears a subject clitic -/ (cf. 1, 6).
Although it seems crucial to indicate person by pronouns and / or clitics, there are
many instances in which person is not marked at all (except for a first person singular461
    The forms wilk and wils are slightly different from the general representation wir 'Γ, as chosen here
The difference cannot be explained. The word espejo is a loan from Spanish and as asuch, the
representation with <j> is maintained.

The interpretation of -in I -ni as markers of habitual present tense is in part inspired
by the meaning and function these forms have in Chipaya (cf. Cerrón Palomino
2006:148). This is necessary because, the Uchumataqu database for -in I -ni is limited
and the translations given in the sources are not transparent with respect to the
meaning of -in I -ni.
        The form -in and its allomorph -ni are attached to verbs and form part of the
Uchumataqu tense system. They mark a habitual present tense (HP) and are therefore
translated as 'habitually' or 'usually'.

The habitual present tense markers -in I -ni are attached to the verb stem and can be
followed by either declarative -cay or Topic marker -ki (cf. 13, 14). The application
of -in I -ni prevents the use of first person singular -u in present tense, as
demonstrated in (15). This feature points in the direction of a tense marking function
since one would expect first person singular -u to appear if -in I -ni were purely
aspectual. However, they themselves have no person marking function471, so in most
of the cases, a subject or subject pronoun is used to express person reference (cf. Π­
Ι 5). It is not expressed by clitic elements alone.

Habitual present tense -in I -ni is attached to action and action-process verbs
Because of the limited database on -in I -ni they may occur in another verb class as
well, but as expected, we do not find -in I -ni on stative, position, or cognition verbs,
whose meanings already express a habitual concept.
      There are homonymous forms where a linking element /i/ is inserted and
immediately followed by the object marker -n. In such clauses, it can only be
clarified through context whether an habitual present tense is expressed, cf. (16).

With respect to the phonological distribution of habitual present tense -in and its
allomorph -ni, we find free alternation when they appear between two consonants.
After a vowel, -ni follows, while after a consonant -in is applied (either followed by a
vowel or as the final element). In general, -in is employed more often than -ni.                                                     -in      -ni

5.1.3 In-Group marker -acu
The suffix to be described in the following does not entirely belong to the group of
tense marking morphemes but will be treated with these suffixes due to its almost
exclusive use with present tense. The In-Group marker -acu marks a first person
plural exclusive and is therefore best translated as 'we (excl.)', excluding the
addressee. The use of this suffix is remarakble because it can occur with the pronoun
of the first person plural inclusive ucumi 'we (incl.)'.
(17)        ucumi      awaris474-taki lux-acu-cay
            we         SOUI-BEN           eat-m-DEC

            ('ucumi awari-staki lux '-acucay "")                     ( Vellard 1949:167)
However, the use of -acu implies that the addressee is not included, as in (18), where
it is unlikely that the speaker includes the addressee (in this case Vellard) since he
refers to a custom characteristic for his own group. Furthermore, the marker -acu can
be attested only to a certain degree since it is found solely in the works of Métraux
(1935) and Vellard (1949-67). It is in the latter that we find a frequent use of the In-  In one uncertain case we find a possible instance of-in on the weather verb cur- 'to rain'

216                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Group marker -acu, but in Métraux it appears only in a few cases. Not only is it
missing in Uhle (1894) as well but such an element is likewise unknown from
Chipaya.
      In-Group marker -acu cannot be satisfactorily integrated into the Uchumataqu
person marking system, but I would like to point to its presumably recent origin. It is
possible that Uchumataqu once had a four-person system consisting of the pronouns
of first to third person singular and ucumi 'we (incl.)'. As outlined under 4.2, ninaka
'they' and wisnaka 'we (excl) 'may have possibly developed only by an increasing
influence of Aymara. This influence may have caused either the 'invention' of -acu
as a verbal bound marker to indicate the newly adopted first person plural exclusive
or the re-interpretation of an already existing but distinctly used morpheme. As a
further support to this assumption may be taken that -acu is reminiscent of first
person plural ucumi and may have been derived from it to create a verbal bound first
plural exclusive marker.
      However, since there is no firm evidence for this in the sources, I will analyse -
acu as the In-Group marker, which excludes the addressee. For the following
discussion, I rely mainly on Vellard (1949-1967).
(18)       alma475 skit'ti-k[i]   huk-acu-cay
           soul    clothes-TOP bum-iN-DEC
           'We bum the soul's clothes.'                           (Vellard 1949:167)

           NEG know-iN-DEC water-LOC476      swim-TOP
           'We do not know how to swim in the water.' (Vellard 1967:4)
Although In-Group marker -acu is not limited to a specific tense, it is very often
translated as present tense477. However, there are a few instances which are translated
as past tense478 and / or with a person reference other than first person plural
exclusive. These cases are not entirely clear and allow an interpretation as present
tense and first person plural exclusive as well (20).
(20)       wat [aj-kistam pic-acu-cay
           village-SEP      come-lN-DEC
           'We come from the village.'
           (' Yo he venido del pueblo. ')                          (Vellard 1967:29)
Since the form -acu already establishes person reference, the vast majority of all
cases lacks subject pronouns or subject clitics, as in (18) to (20). Thus, the
application of subject pronouns and / or clitics may be considered emphatic, as in
(21, example 17 repeated).","[228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"
"6.1.3 Adverbs of manner
In most languages, manner adverbs form the largest group of adverbs. However, for
Uchumataqu only a comparatively small number of manner adverbs can be
established which may be due to the documentary situation. Among these adverbs are
asta and loaloa both meaning 'quickly', untu 'hard, strong', and ina 'in vain'. In
contrast to the adverbial subclasses discussed above, manner adverbs are combined
with adjectival morphology, i.e. predicator -kasi (13) and they take clausal clitics,
such as declarative -cay or affirmative -pini (14).
(13)        ops-kasi   (a)pa:-ta-ni
            secret-PRE make-RES-SR
            'That which is done secretly.'                           (Métraux 1935:107)
( 14)       untu-pini k 'au-k 'awa-aca-cay
            hard-AFF cry-cry-iR-DEC
            '(S)he [probably] cries very hard.'579                   (Vellard 1951:24)
579
   Vellard (ibid.) translated the clause as habitual, i.e. the author analysed -aca as habitual marker instead
of irrealis. Thus, we do not know what kind of irrealis -aca denotes here and the translation offered here is
rather speculative For further discussion, see 5.8.2.6.
256                              UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
However, in most cases, manner adverbs are not inflected at all (15).
(15)           loaloa ton-aki-cay wat[a]-kina
               quick come-FU-DEC village-DlR
               'You will come very quickly to the village.' (Métraux 1935:109)
The expression ina 'in vain' demands some discussion. It can take predicator -kasi
but it also takes the forms -ci and -kacu. The element -ci may be the nominal
possessive marker -ci (cf. 4.1.2.1) in which case ina would be an exception from the
general adjectival coding pattern. The element -ci appears only on elicited, singular
items and when ina occurs within a clause, it is not inflected with -ci (16).
(16)           has    ina     ki-aca-kiSB0
               now in_vain speak-IR-TOP
               'Now, (s)he may speak in vain.'                          (Métraux 1935:98)
The following is the only example clause that contains the element -kacu.
(17)           ni     hina-kacu oxk-cay
               (s)he in vain-? go-DEC
               '(S)he goes in vain.'                                    (Vellard 1951:13)
It may be possible that -kacu developed from the alternative form of predicator -kasi
which is -kaci (cf. 4.3.3) by way of final vowel deletion and co-articulation. In this
case, final /if of -kaci would have been deleted and co-articulation may have led to
the form -kacu. If this is true, it would be a further proof of the adjectival nature of
ina. In this case, an inflection with nominal possessive -ci seems unlikely and the
form -ci has to remain uncertain.","[272, 273]"
"595
    Uhle (1894'92.1) reports three instances where ana seems to be combined with the pronoun of
exhortative first person plural inclusive cukfij However, Uhle himself (1894.65) points out that in Irohito
no such combination exists and therefore, these uncertain instances will not be considered in the following

    Both hek 'who' and culu 'what' are in principle interrogative pronouns (see 4.2 5) but serve as
indefinite pronouns as well

           'We [certainly] did not kill any lama.'597 (Vellard 1967:11)
Since negation ana and the indefinite pronoun form one expression, they hardly ever
split up. However, on a few rare occasions this is possible and we may assume that it
is highly marked in order to express e.g. emphasis.
(48)       qotsuni-pini ci waxlfaj-stani ana tox'sasm ci-cul
           Uru-AFF         one village-COM NEG other          what

           not any other.'                             (Vellard 1967:18)
The overwhelming majority of negative indefinite pronouns appears at the beginning
of the entire clause, in one case, it immediately precedes the verb phrase it negates,
and example (48) is the only instance where the expression occurs at the end of the
clause. Thus, we may assume that example (48) is marked twice, i.e. the negative
indefinite pronoun occurs at the end and, furthermore, it is split up.
       In the last category to be discussed here, the negation ana is combined with
lexemes in order to express an antonymic relation. Since the resulting expressions are
found throughout the sources, they may be regarded as lexicalised. The following
combinations exist: ana cuni 'bad (lit.: 'not good')', ana ci cuni 'bad (lit.: 'not one
good')', ana cini 'mute (lit.: 'the one who does not speak')', and ana ep(-cic) 'orphan
(lit.: 'no father[-having]')'. At least for the paraphrastic expression ana cini 'mute'
exists a synthetic synonym which is cukcilai or chuxta, respectively (Polo 1901:473,
Muysken 2005:45).
(49)       ana aep-cic

The negation ana can be inflected with personal (example 51) and clausal clitics,
such as declarative -cay (example 52) although in most cases it does not take
morphological marker at all (examples 49, 50).

  Usually, toxsa serves an Uchumataqu name for the Aymara people, meaning 'the others' It is uncertain
why it is employed here instead ofcila 'another'
CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                 265(52)       ana-cay cum

In most cases, the lexemes that are combined with ana do not take further
morphological marking However, ep 'father' and cim 'speaker' are exceptional,
since they can be inflected with possessive -ci and subject relativiser -ni,
respectively
     With respect to word order, the lexical expressions have a tendency to appear
either at the beginning of the entire clause or to precede the item they refer to,
although this happens less often Only in two cases does the negative lexical
expression follow the negated phrase (examples 53) and both clauses are predicate
clauses

           'The maize is bad '                                  (Métraux 1935 101)
Only in some exceptional cases does negation ana lose its final vowel In the works
of Vel lard (1949-67) and Muysken (2005) the negation is sometimes decnbed as
hana or jana, respectively This points to a fricative quality the initial sound may
have, similar to Aymara ham (ci Portene-Gutiérrez 1981 32) However, in the
majonty of all cases600, the negation is transenbed as ana and therefore, I adopted
this spelling here

In what follows, I will describe the clause types Uchumataqu displays and the
morphological means by which they are marked. I will first discuss clausal and
personal clitics before turning to a description of clause types, including declarative,
imperative, and interrogative as well as predicate clauses. The final sections will be
concerned with the several types of complex clauses in Uchumataqu.","[280, 281, 282, 283, 284]"
