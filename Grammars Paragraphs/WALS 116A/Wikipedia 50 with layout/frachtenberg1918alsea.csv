     suooeeding sectio.ns. the su.l'i'lxed particles (s6699120-124) and
     the adverbs (see§§ 150-153).      Ther·· are. however, other ways
     and means of distinguishing them rrom the latter elements, from
     which they differ vastly in two particular respects; first in
     reference to. the poal tion they occupy in a complex of words and.
     secondly. in regard to the various meanings which the~ imply.
     Unlike the suffixed particles, they form no unit whatsoever
     with either a preceding or following word, being phonetically
•    absolutely independent.     They may be shifted from one place to
     another without affecting, in !Ul.y way, the sense of' the sentence,
     and they ref'er rather to the whole sentence than to any speclf'ie
    , part of it.   In contradistinction to the adverbs, they are not
     always capable of expressing a de.finlte or clear idea, when
     used alo8.e.
             A majority of these expletives have no accent of their
     own, being either enclitic or proclitic.     A .few are composed
     of' two or more distinct particles and express the combined ideas
     of their component elements; soma appear in the form of verbal
     stems, while others may be verbalized or nominalized by means
     of a proper verbal and nominal suffix     (see§'§33. 155).
             All particles are used to exp ..'ess grarrmmtlcal categories•    and syntactic relations.     Their functions cover a wide range of'
     ideas, in accordance with which they may be subdivided into the

            All infinitive suffixes tnlst be used in conjuntion with
    the pl'ei'ixes   1:..-   or   l!~ (seej{30. 32.33),          excepting in cases
    where the grouping of too many sounds in initial position has
    necessitated the drOppins of the prefiX (see§'{ 4, 14).                 J;t will
    be well to remember that, gener'llly speakine, all intransItive
     infinitives require the prefix               1:..-, while the transitive verbs
    are preceded by the prefis             ,2-'
            An analysis of the several infinitive suffixes Shows them
     to have the element          -1    in cOl'l1mon. which may be consids2ed as
    the elemsnt expressiTlb a general modal idea of an ini'initive                    or
    participial character.             Whether this      -1   Is in any way related
e   to the various other Alsea suffixes of similar structure. is a
    matter of mere conjecture.             It seems, however, that there can
    ,be no connection between the auxiliary and nominal         -1 (see 47.     5,
    115), the hzpsrati'le         -1 (see;' 69) and this formative element
     (see ~ 33).     The infinitive suffixes for transitive verbs have
    the element      -~      in connnon (see i. '74).
            In orcer to avoid a classification of the infinl tl 'Ie
    formative elements into too many sections, all these postpositions
    have been divided here. r,:.ther arbitr'lrily. into two categoriest
          (1)   Infinitive suffixes for intransitive verbs.
          (2)   Infinitive suffixes for transitive verbs.
            It has been found convenient to begin the discussion of
    the infinitive mode with those suf""fixes that are added toe   intransitive verbs.

     by means of the temporal suffixes, such as: the Inchoative                    _~     -I (see § 76), the transitional -!I (seag 77), the continua.tive

     is not infrequently amplified by Il'!eSl!lS of a voaclic change (see
e    § 130).          Verbs that end in a consonant, insert a weak vowel
     between their final consonant and this suffix (see               § 4).

              -xamt     refers to plural subjects (see ,84).                  It follows
    the stem directly (see, 4), or else it is preceded by the recip-    rocal     -ll!.! (see § 56), by the distributive               _sal (see S 59), by
    the ibchoative        -1 (see j 76 ) or by the continuative -~ (see
    ~ ~ 46,   '79).    In the f'irst mentioned instance it denotes, besides
    the infinitive mode. also a reciprocal Qction.                   The verbal stem
    to which this suf'fix is added nnlst be preceded by the prefix                       ~­    (see   i 30) which may be omitted, whenever the verbal stem begins
    with a cluster of consonants              (see 9 4).    Like the preceding           _!.
e   this format! va element has been rendered by the infini ti va, by a
    participle, by a nOun or by the indicative mood.                        Its etymology
    is obscure.        'I'he final ele:r.1ent is undoubtedly the general infinitive
    -1 (see 9 72 and above).           'lhe    !.   of   ~     cannot be the verbal
    sign, since that element does not occur in the infinitive mode
    (see    f 46); nor does the !!! seem to be in any Ylay related to
    the future     -E (see f 81). It is probable, however, that it    may be rel'lted to the nomna! suffix                 -xam (see ~ 111).

                 -1st      is added to transitive verbs and indicates the presence
    of a direct or indirect third person object.                    It can be used onl,-
    in co njunction with the prefix                ;e.- (see 9 32).    It follows the
    verbal stem directly or it may be preceded by SOme temporal suffix,
    or by the prono:rn1nal eleI:1ent         ~ (see     5 42) ..    The phonetic a.greement
    between this suffix, the subjective pronoun for                   t~e   inclusive dual    (aee ~ 35) and the nominal             -~ (see    9 115) is purely accidental.
    It is probable, however, that it may be                ~el·lted   to the impera.tive
e   .on (see 9 69); and it is, furthermore, conceivable that, owing to
    t..~e   presence of the intentional p_""efix. the infinitive phrase is
    ~reated as a future tense, in which case the                    -1: may be the
    suffix for the transitive future (see, 82) and the                       _.!!:,   identical
    with the sirr.i1a.r elel1ent which expresses an intransitive infinitive
    idea         (see §'~ 33, '13).   It is also possible that the           -1 may be
    the inchoative tense sisn (see            9 '16).     This sui'f'ix appears also as
    -.!l!b in accordance with the 113.;.,. permitting the interchanbe between
         1- dip thong and the onlg 1- vowel (seej' 2).            ust-        to follow                  tsl110lxwe Lx paul sitallst (they) were

             Casas of gra.mrnat1ea1 suppletton are not missing in
    Alsea.   'l'b.us certain stems have been found that OCCLlr in
    two distinct forms, one of whieh. ean be need in the Singular

    manner a limited number of nouns denotIng sex and gender have
    been observed to Deeur in parallel forms~ one for the singular
    and the other for the plural.
             Reduplication in Alsee. does not seem to have any
    fix.ad morphological illnction.   Its occurrence is I""are and
    irregular.   It Is not at all improbable, that originally 1 t
    may have indleated l'$ot-procailty of action.
             Vocal Ie changes are employed for the pUI""'pose of
    expI""esslng ideas of contlIl:uation and repetition, and of
    differentiating between the subjective and objective f'orms
    of the independent personal and demonstrative pronouns. 1b.e
    synctactic particles play an important part in Alsea phraseology.
    ihey are chiefly used to denote syntactic relations.       Hence,
    they express degrees of certainty and knowledge, emotional
    states, connection with preViou.sly expressed ideas, emphasis,
    exhortation, comparison, interrogation and concHttonality.
    Certain particles are also used in a pronominal, numeral and

         This sui'f1x seems to be composed of' the discriminative
prefix   !- (966 §9 24, 33) amplified by me~e.s of ""\::hE! demonstrat~~ <,_

It is also possIble that the       .! may be the general modal elema.nt'
that has been discussed in a preceding seetion (see f                 SO).      In
any event, the vcrbal sign would seem superfluous, as both thE)prefix   !,- < and the sui'fl,x   -,!, have a discriminative function.
That a di9criminatlV6 element should be used as denoting a re-
flexive action is perfectly justified by the fact. that iIt 1:JUch

Object of the sentence.      The form    -~     has been a.bbreviatedfrom   -xasx; it coincides phonetically with the abbreviated form

    J.aation of   long:r and        ~ taee ;Sa).   !hese two consonants are
    always changed Into vowels            (£., ~. ~ and 1) when preceded by
    consonants, unlells the vocaliZation Is prevented by the insortion
    of' a weak vowel between the.!. and Z and the consonants that
    precede them (see §4).            The change takes place mostly aftere   12. !!!-. !!, ~. !:.. and!.       VocaliZation of the .! occurs more

•   (see § 78), all semi_temporal suffixes ure treated as modal
    elements and must precede the true te':,po.t'ul sui'fixes.
             A lIlIljority of the tempor!!.l suffixes appear in two forms
    one denoting the time of transitive actions, and the other expressing
    intransitive peri'ormsnces.        '.!.he former are u::Jually compo;1ed of the
    temporal elements plus the objective suffixes (see§i 37-44) or
    are rendered by using the temporal suf'fix in conjunction with    the transitivlzin.:; prefix      l- (see ISO) i the latter include in
    their composition the intrnnsitive          -~ (see ~ 48).
             Of the several tenses that occur in Alsea the most important
    seem to be the continuative aru'l future        c:lte~ories.   which are
    expressed by a great v~riety of distinct suffixes.              All continuative
    elements are invariably '~dded to the ,,-orist form of iii. verbal stem;•   that is to say, to that forIJ. which has been amplified by means of
    a vocalic change (see    in a separate future form.
                                9' 130).   The future seems to be of utnost    importance, each senli-temporal (and even the past) tense appearing
                                       The Alsea lafi.t,~age has no distinct
    suffix for the present tense, 1.'rhieb is usually rendered by one
    of the inchoative ele-:-:ents (see     9 76).
             Practically all temporal suffixes are subject to a process    of abbreviation which consists of the droppiIlG oi' the final    syll3.-:::1es {see   9 19}, and all h~3.ve --- in ac;dition to their
    temporal character ___ also a verbaliziJlci function, chlll1.ging

               BotIc suffixes are sonetimes               1Jreced~d   by the glottal stop

•   and identical structure,! and may be ultimately connect-3d with    the Alsea auxiliary           -1 (see       f ¥l), It II1Ilst not, bOVlever, be
    confused with ot!lfitr Alsea formative elements, such as: the
    imperative        -1 (see § 69), the infinitive -1 (see § 72) or the
    demonstrative prefix        1- (seeJ§25, 33). Similarly the post_
    position     -~    is in no way related to the ma.ny su:':-fixes that
    have the same phonetic structu~.'e (see                if 33, 35, 69, '73-74)            J
    although it is quite possible that it may form part of the
    passive suffixes           -~        -~         (see   p 64).      It is furthermore,
    highly probable that i t may be eventually related to the Sluslaw

Introductory             Alsea. employes several suffixes for the purPOdB of e~res~1ng""    the imperative mood.         A clear line of demaI'c!ltlon is drawn bet,,~e1J'    the imperative and the prohibitive; each being indicated by'dl.sttne't·    sui'fixes.    Tt..e prohibitive is usually obtained from the u.ori.st          forn•   of the verbal stem (see § 130).            A spedal suffix innicntos the    imperative of verbs th'1t express, besides a command, also other    Idea.s, chiefl-y of' a modal nature        (see   !'i 67).
             In the imperative the pronOminal element for the second    person   slngul,~r   is Olritted; dual and plural persons, however,    must be expressed, which is accomplished by the. suffiXation of    theo proper SUbj~ctive pronouns to the iwperative elements (see    § 35).    The prohibitive requires the pre8ence of all pronominal
    elements that represent the parsons to whon a comr.!snd has been    addressed..    'I'hi.'l mood is treated as a future expression; honce
    the-,Sd'bjective pronouns precede the verbal stem (3e69,;)5, 80).","[214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219]"
