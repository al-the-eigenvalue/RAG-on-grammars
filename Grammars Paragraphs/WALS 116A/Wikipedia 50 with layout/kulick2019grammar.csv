"3.9 Interrogatives (q)3.9.1 Yes/no questionsYes/no questions in Tayap are formed with the clitic =ke. The part of speech to
which =ke is cliticized is the focus of the question. So compare:(3-88) a. Amanike okɨnet?
          Amani =ke o           -kɨ   -net?
          Amani =q go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
          ‘Will Amani (as opposed to someone else) go?’       b. Amani okɨnetke?
          Amani o          -kɨ   -net                =ke?
          Amani go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s =q
          ‘Will Amani go?’ (as opposed to ‘will Amani stay?’)Because it expresses uncertainty, =ke can also be used in a context where it would
be translated as ‘or’:(3-89) a. epi ŋa Mbowdike Aperke yim okɨtike Potowre
          epi       ŋa Mbowdi =ke Aper =ke yim
          tomorrow 1sg Mbowdi =q Aper =q 1pl           o        -kɨ -tike   Potow=re
           go.irr -irr -dl.irr Wongan=all
           ‘tomorrow I’ll go with either Mbowdi or Aper to Wongan’
           (lit. ‘tomorrow I Mbowdi? Aper? we two will go to Wongan’)       b. ŋɨ mbaranɨke kut mɨrinɨke

               be.sg.m.r rainforest=loc=q
               ‘he’s either in the garden or in the rainforest’Note that the interrogative clitic follows the locative clitic when they co-occur, as
in example (3-89b).","[116, 117]"
"3.1.3.3 Non-particular nouns
Nouns that otherwise could be expected to be masculine can be feminine under
two circumstances.
     The first is when the subject or referent of a verb is a general class of people
rather than a named or known individual. For example, the following utterance
is from a harangue by an older Tayap speaker who is chastising younger vil-
lagers for behaving badly. In the course of his harangue, the speaker wonders
rhetorically which big man (i.e. which old, knowledgeable man) is still alive to
teach young people about the good ways of the past. (The answer, he knows,
is ‘none’.)
     His question was phrased as follows:(3-22) Ani munje suman wuk?
       who man      big      be.3sg.f.r
       ‘Which big man is here (i.e. still living)?’Note that the verb ‘be’ is inflected in 3sg.f, even though the referent is unambig-
uously a male. The use of the feminine form here conveys generality. It refers to
the category or class of ‘big men’ rather than to a specific big man. If the speaker
had phrased the question using the 3sg.m form of ‘be’, kut, the question would
be referring to a specific named or known big man: ‘Which one of the big men we
all know is present here right now?’
     Another example of the same phenomenon is the following (feminine forms
that denote the male referent are in bold):
                                                                    Nouns        61

       other=erg.f talk.irr -3sg.f.irr neg
       ‘The man is of course finding his strength and doing it on his own,
       nobody else is telling him to’This utterance was spoken during a tense discussion about the incessant and dis-
ruptive drinking in the village that, by late 2009, had been plaguing Gapun for
some time. During a village-wide meeting, the mother of a fifteen-year-old boy
shouted angrily that her husband never tried to stop their son from drinking.
     In response, a man in his late thirties made the comment above, which is
dismissive of the mother and supports the young man’s father by implying that
it wouldn’t matter what the father told his son. The son, this man is saying, is old
enough and would act according to his own desires anyway: no one is ordering
him to drink; he does it because he wants to. But as in the previous example,
(3-22), this utterance refers to a male using feminine grammatical forms.
     The rhetorical effect is the same: the speaker’s use of feminine grammatical
forms when talking about a male conveys a meaning of generality. The speaker
is not overtly disputing anything the mother says about her son or her husband,
these grammatical forms say; he is making a general observation.
     A non-literal but semantically more accurate translation of the man’s remark
would be: ‘As young men get older and stronger of course they decide on their own
what they want to do, they don’t do things just because other people tell them to’.","[80, 81]"
"3.9.2 Information questionsInformation questions are formed using one of the following interrogative words,
many of which are readily segmentable, e.g. anire ‘with whom’ can be segmented
as ani=re ‘who=com’; ani=yi is who=erg.f; ani=mat is who=poss, etc.:
ani                ‘who?’                ambinŋa/ ambukŋa         ‘which?’
aniyi              ‘who (did it)?’       ambuknɨ                  ‘how?’
animat             ‘whose?’              ambukranɨ                ‘how many?’/ ‘how
anire              ‘with whom?’                                   much?’
ambin              ‘what?’               ana(knɨ)                 ‘where?’
ambin ana          ‘why?’/ ‘what for?’   anakŋa                   ‘from where?’
ambinekenɨ         ‘from what?’          ana sokop                ‘when?’

affirmation or disagreement, as well as affective involvement with, or phatic
acknowledgement of, other people. These interjections form an utterance by
themselves:ore             ‘Yes’. This is a Watam-language borrowing that has all but
                replaced Tayap’s awo.awo             The Tayap word for the affirmative ‘Yes’. Since the 1980s,
                however, it has become replaced by ore, and the meaning of
                awo has shifted to express sarcastic agreement that would be
                translated in English as ‘Yeah, right’ or ‘Like I’m so sure’.
                The word has also taken on connotations of confrontation and
                violence. It is shouted at others whom one is prepared to strike.
                Parents use it frequently to threaten disobedient children, and
                an adult engaged in a shouting match with another adult might
                use it to signal that her or his patience is about to give in. When
                it is shouted with sharp, rising volume and strong stress on the
                final syllable awó, the word is a warning that means: ‘You haven’t
                listened to my warnings and now I’m about to come and hit you!’wákare         ‘No’. This is also the morpheme of negation, often shortened to
                wak when used to mean ‘No’ (as in: ‘Is there any food left?’ ‘No’).
                When asked as a sharp question with rising intonation, wákare
                signifies a threat, meaning: ‘So you’re not doing what I told you
                to do? (I’m therefore going to come and hit you)’.ario            ‘He/she/it is coming to get you’. This word is used to scare
                babies and small children. It is uttered preceded by the name of
                the person or thing that the caregiver wants the child to think is
                coming to get him or her, and is a vocative call, calling directly
                to the person or thing to come and get the baby (in order to hit
                the baby, or devour the baby).kapambínana ‘Exactly’, ‘Of course’

              a caregiver insists they do something they don’t want to do, or

                  response to someone saying “Poor thing, I have no food to
                  give you”, it means: ‘Don’t worry about it’, ‘Don’t bother’.
100          3 Word classesye                    Two different meanings:
                      (1) when uttered in a sudden, staccato burst, it means: ‘Oh!’,
                          ‘Oh no!’ This sound is frequently used by caregivers to scare
                          children. At least when children are very young, the alarmed
                          quality of this sound can be an effective way of making
                          them move away from an open fire or put down a sharp
                          butcher knife. If the child is still a baby, this sound is often
                          accompanied by the caregiver wrapping her or his arms
                          around the baby as if to protect the baby;
                      (2) when uttered with an extended vowel and a curled lip, it
                          means: ‘Gross’; ‘Disgusting’; ‘Feel shame’.amaye                 An expression moaned and cried by people experiencing

"SynonymsWhere no example or explanation is given between two cross-referenced words that
mean the same thing, I have been unable to elicit any difference in meaning. Examples
are ŋgakraw and ndadab, both of which mean ‘peel’, i.e. the skin of a fruit or vege-
table that has been removed. My questions about difference in meaning were consis-
tently answered with a version of the following: “If you want to say ŋgakraw, you’ll
say ŋgakraw. If you want to say ndadab you’ll say ndadab. They mean the same”
(“Yu laik tok ŋgakraw bai yu tok ŋgakraw. Na yu laik tok ndadab bai yu tok ndadab.
Em wankain mining tasol”). Or I would sometimes be told “wanpela mining na tok
i bruk”: there’s one meaning but the talk (i.e. the language) is broken, or fractured.

     In some cases – for example, two different verbs that mean ‘sweep’: mburai
(class 5) and mburai-(p)-i (class 1) – the words are true synonyms (although in this
case, it is clear that the verb is mburai; in the class 1 form it is constructed with i- ‘give’).
     In other cases, the difference in the meaning of two words may have been lost.
I suspect, for example, that the two words for ‘bridge’, koŋgrik and nɨmɨrkokɨr,
at one time referred to different kinds of bridges – made of different material,
spanning different bodies of water or constructed in different ways. However, I
was unable to elicit any difference in meaning from the most senior speakers in
the village. Whatever difference may have existed is now forgotten.","[362, 363]"

Tayap has a six-way distinction for singular referents – three for feminine ref-
erents and three for masculine referents. As in other parts of Tayap grammar,
the gender distinction collapses in the plural, and here the language maintains a
two-way distinction:

Note that the three-way distance distinction in the singular and two-way in the
plural is highly unusual and may in fact be a simplification: the middle term in
the singular could in fact be a close-to-addressee term or expressing other prag-
matic factors (see e.g. Wilkins 1999).5
     In addition to the words listed above, Tayap also has a number of slightly
different deictic words. They are as follows:
Feminine               Masculine                       Pluralaŋgok…aŋgo             aindet….ende ‘this …here’
                                   6
                                                       aŋgeb…aŋge
‘this... here’         anɨndet…ende/inde/ide/de        ‘these…there’
aŋgudek…aŋgu           ‘that…there’                    aŋgɨb… aŋgɨb ‘those…
‘that…there’                                           there’The first or second words in these pairs can occur alone functioning as an argu-
ment of a verb phrase. During a disagreement between two men, for example, one
protagonist responded to the other’s threats to come and beat him up with the
dismissive snort addressed to everybody who was listening:6(3-84) aindetŋike oyin?
       aindet      =ŋi       =ke o          -yi -n?
       that_one =erg.m =q strike.irr -1sg.irr.o -sg|1pl.irr.s
       ‘that one there is going to hit me?’These topicalizing deictic words often co-occur, sometimes multiple times in an
utterance.7 They can be post-posed to a noun to emphasize it, for example in
response to a question like ‘Who did it?’:5 We thank Anna Margetts for this observation.
6 The second word here, ende, can also be realized as inde, ide or de
7 It is possible that these instances might more felicitously be labeled “focusing”, “highlight-
ing” or “emphasizing” rather than topicalizing (Reesink 2014). More information and analysis
on the functions of all these deicitics is needed.
                                                                Deictics (dx)     95

          dx.m man         dx.m crazy     dx.m
          ‘this man is crazy’A third set of related deictic words are demonstrative identifiers, which indicate
particularity and presence, e.g. ‘it’s me’, or ‘I’m here’ (as opposed to being away
somewhere). The term “demonstrative identifiers” comes from Diessel (1999).
These words function in a similar way to how an adverb like ecco functions in the
Italian eccomi – ‘it’s me’ or ‘here I am’. So the most common response to a ques-
tion like ‘Who are you?’ – asked, for example when one hears someone approach-
ing in the pitch blackness of a moonless night – is Ŋa ainda (‘it’s me’).    ainda    used with ŋa (1sg.m and 1sg.f)
                       yu (2sg.m and 2sg.f)
                       yim (1pl)
                       yum (2pl)
    ainde    used with ŋɨ (3sg.m)
    aŋgo(de) used with ŋgu (3sg.f)
    aŋge(de) used with ŋgɨ (3sg.pl) and dlThese words are virtually obligatory with many verbs, such as aku ‘be’, in the
sense that even though it would be grammatically correct to just say ŋɨ kut (‘he’s
here’), it is pragmatically awkward. One should say ŋɨ ainde kut (‘he dx.m is here’).
    Finally, in addition to all the deictic forms listed above, Tayap also has a
quasi-deictic suffix -me, which means ‘yes, indeed, that one (or those) as opposed
to any other or others’, occurring on pronouns.
    -me is also used to emphasize a referent, for example:(3-87) a. ŋgɨme aŋgi ŋgwokara
          ŋgɨ -me aŋgi ŋgwok          -ara
          3pl -dx dx.pl go.3pl.r -perf

heard phrases in Tayap: ŋguméŋgi. This phrase – a contracted form of ŋgu-me aŋgi
(3sg.f-me + aŋgi) – means ‘yes, that way’, ‘that’s right’ (“em nau” in Tok Pisin).","[113, 114, 115, 116]"
"3.1.3.2 Principles of gender assignment
There are two genders in Tayap: feminine and masculine. Humans have natural
gender, even though this can be overridden when the referent is non-particular
(see below). The gender classification of all other animate nouns is decided by
three criteria.
58          3 Word classes    The first is particularity: the unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including
animate nouns, is feminine.1
    The second is sex: a male referent may be specified as masculine and a female
referent feminine.
    The third criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be
masculine; short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine.
    Snakes (long and thin) and cassowaries (tall and imposing), therefore, are
prototypically masculine; pigs (fat and stocky) are prototypically feminine. So in
a sentence like ‘he speared a pig’, the object ‘pig’ will be designated by the femi-
nine object suffix -ku unless the speaker specifically wants to point out that it was
male, in which case the masculine object suffix -ŋgɨ would be used.
    The difference is as follows:(3-19) a. ŋɨŋi mbor pokun
          ŋɨ      =ŋi       mbor po         -ku                       -n
          3sg.m =erg.m pig         strike.r -3sg.f.r.o                -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘he speared a (female) pig’        b. ŋɨŋi mbor poŋgɨn
           ŋɨ      =ŋi      mbor po           -ŋgɨ       -n
           3sg.m =erg.m pig          strike.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘he speared a (male) pig’The following chart shows the process of gender assignment in Tayap:
                                              Is it particular?
                                          yes               no                                   is it male?             feminine
                             yes                 no
                                                 feminine      shape long?                      shape stocky?
      yes       no                     yes            nomasculine       feminine           feminine           masculineTayap gender decision tree
1 Foley (2000: 371) notes that among those Papuan languages which have gender, binary con-
trasts are typical, and feminine is always the unmarked gender.
                                                                     Nouns           59
     As the chart suggests, even though snakes and cassowaries are commonly
masculine, a short, fat snake or a squat, short-necked cassowary could be referred
to using feminine forms.
     The shape-based assignment of gender is not entirely predictable, however.
A praying mantis is generally masculine, perhaps because its name is homopho-
nous with ‘cassowary’ (i.e. ŋgat). And a millipede (kakámatik), even though it is
long, is generally feminine, perhaps because it is stubby, fat, and slow moving,
at least compared to a centipede (yandum), which is sleek and slithering (and
generally masculine).
     Even though nouns tend to be generally classified as feminine, there are
some nouns which are always (in the case of natural phenomena and insects) or
tend to be (in the case of animals and birds) masculine.
     The nouns in question are:Natural phenomena       Animals, birds and insectsarawer ‘sun’            aram ‘snake’                    ŋgararik ‘monitor lizard’
ŋgudum ‘star’           kakarpwap ‘eagle’               ŋgat ‘cassowary’; ‘praying
nekan ‘earthquake’      kamban ‘magpie’                 mantis’
aruat ‘thunder’         kekékato ‘worm’                 njakep ‘flying fox bat’
pora ‘wind’             momɨk ‘guria pigeon’            ondom ‘hornbill’
urerŋgar ‘lightning’    nekan ‘stick insect’, Note:     orem ‘crocodile’
                        homophonous with ‘earthquake’   pesaw ‘bird of paradise’
                                                        yandum ‘centipede’
Examples are:(3-20) nekan        katot
       earthquake happen.3sg.m.r
       ‘an earthquake (m) happened’(3-21) ŋayi aram tanɨŋgɨn
       ŋa =yi          aram ta -nɨ -ŋgɨ      -n
       1sg =erg.f snake see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r. s
       ‘I (f) saw a snake (m)’This gender system shares some similarity with the East Sepik, Ndu family lan-
guage Manambu, in which gender assignment is determined in part by the size
and shape of the referent (Aikhenvald et al. 2008; see also Reesink 2003 on North
Papuan languages). Aikhenvald et al. (2008: 112) note that shape-based gender
assignment is a feature of languages of the Sepik area, also citing Alamblak (Bruce
60        3 Word classes1984). Other languages of the Sepik-Ramu region have gender, but very different
systems: Foley (2000: 366) notes for instance that Lower Sepik languages have a
phonological gender system; that is, gender assignment is based on the phono-
logical form of the noun root.
    On the other hand, the situational element to Tayap’s gender system – in
which gender is partly a matter of the discourse situation rather than a fixed
property of a noun – is reminiscent of that of Bilua, a Papuan language spoken
on Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands. In Bilua, masculine gender is used
for third-person singular masculine human referents as well as “singulative”
non-human nouns. But all other nouns are marked feminine, the default form
(Obata 2003: 88, 105–109).","[77, 78, 79, 80]"
"Authorship of this bookThe first person pronoun used throughout this work refers to Don Kulick. I col-
lected all the linguistic and ethnographic data analyzed here over the course of
my thirty years’ work in Gapun. As mentioned above, I wrote the entire first draft
of this grammar and dictionary and submitted it for review at Pacific Linguistics in
2011. Shelving the project to complete other work, I took it up again in 2017, when
I approached linguist Angela Terrill, who had trained in descriptive linguistics at
ANU and written a grammar of the Papuan language, Lavukaleve, to collaborate
with me in rewriting the text (Terrill 2003). Angela worked on the morphological
and grammatical analysis in preparing the manuscript for publication.

Conventions and abbreviations
Tayap examples in the grammar usually consist of four lines. The first is the Tayap
speech written in bounded, unsegmented words.
     The second line is the same clause or sentence in which the words have been
separated into morphemes.
     The third line is the interlinear gloss of the morphemes. The space separating
the morphemes in the second and third lines is larger than it is in most grammars
for reasons of readability. The usual manner of presentation, in which glosses for
morphemes are chained together in long, complicated strings, assumes readers
with a great deal of specialized knowledge, experience and patience. Separat-
ing the morphemes should make the glosses easier to process. The spacing does
admittedly make it a bit harder to see individual words, but those appear in the
first line of the examples.
     The fourth line is the translation into English.
     An example is as follows:(1) Merewŋgrogi munje parŋgɨro
    Merew -ŋgro =gi             munje par     -ŋgɨ       -ro
    Sanae    -pl     =erg.pl man       bury.r -3sg.m.r.o -3pl.r.s
    ‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’Suffixes are marked by hyphens (-) and clitics are marked with an equal sign (=).
In Tayap there are no prefixes, only suffixes, and enclitics rather than proclitics.
      Some glossing conventions used throughout this grammar in the interlinear
glosses need to be noted. Tayap verbs – and other words – have a broad range of
meanings, and an o, for example, is consistently glossed as ‘strike’ in the interlin-
ear glosses, but is translated to its context-specific meaning as ‘hit’, ‘stab’, ‘kill’,
etc. in the translation. Similarly, the Locative case has a broad range of meanings.
It is glossed as loc when it has a locational meaning but in other contexts it may
be glossed as temp for temporal, com for comitative or all for allative.
      Further conventions need explanation are as follows:
      The first is the pipeline symbol | which appears in example 3 below under-
neath the final morpheme -n. This symbol means that the morpheme it glosses
has more than one meaning. Disambiguation occurs through the use of pronouns
or nouns, or through context.
      An S is used in glossing transitive verbs to show features of the subject. With
intransitive verbs, the person/number/status of subjects are marked in the lan-
guage but there is no S in the gloss.

                                            Conventions and abbreviations     XIX
    Another convention concerns Tayap’s discontinuous subject markers. Some
verbs have subject morphemes that occur both before and after the object mor-
pheme. An example is as follows:(2) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
    ŋgu    =yi      aram ta  -tɨ  -ŋgɨ                  -n
    3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -r.s -3sg.m.r.o            -r.s
    ‘she saw a snake’In this verb, the combination of -tɨ before the object morpheme and -n after the
object morpheme encodes either a 2sg or 3sg.f subject in realis status. The
pronoun ‘she’ disambiguates the subject to be 3sg.f, in this case. Since it is the
combination of the two discontinuous subject morphemes that produces meaning,
the labeling convention adopted here is to gloss the first subject morpheme
with ‘s’ (‘subject’), and to gloss the combined meaning of the two morphemes
under the second morpheme. The object morpheme in verbs like this case occurs
between the two subject markers, and is bounded by < > instead of hyphens, to
show that it intervenes between the two discontinuous subject markers.
    So in this grammar, the example above is written as:(3) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
    ŋgu    =yi      aram ta  -tɨ         -ŋgɨ        -n
    3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -s-         <3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
    ‘she saw a snake’The abbreviations used in the interlinear glosses otherwise generally follow the
Leipzig glossing rules.
    Note that the dictionary uses some different terms and abbreviations (see
page 351 for those).

1 The Tayap language and its speakers1.1 General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in
    GapunTayap is the name of a Papuan language spoken by a dwindling number of people,
most of whom live in a small village called Gapun (the speakers themselves call
the language Tayap mer, which means, precisely, ‘Tayap language’). Gapun is
located on the Papua New Guinea mainland, between the Sepik and Ramu rivers,
about thirty kilometers inland from the northern coast. The village is far from
roads of any kind and is difficult to reach. It lies in a mosquito- and leech-infested
swamp in the middle of the rainforest (see Map 1.1).
     The Tayap language is tiny, even by the extreme standards of Papua New
Guinea, where one linguist estimated that thirty five percent of the languages
have fewer than five hundred speakers (Sankoff 1980: 96). As far as anyone in
Gapun has been able to remember, Tayap has never had more than, at most, just
over one hundred speakers. That small number seems to have remained stable for
a very long time. By the 1980s, however, children were no longer learning Tayap
as their first language. Instead, they were learning Tok Pisin, the most important
and widely-spoken national language of Papua New Guinea.
     I began my work in Gapun in 1985. At that time, the number of people who
actively commanded Tayap – in the sense that they spoke it with other villagers
and were able to narrate stories in it – was about ninety, out of a population of
about one hundred and thirty (most but not all of whom lived in Gapun). Twenty
three years later, in 2009, the population of Gapun had grown to two hundred
and eight people. In addition, seventeen people who had been born and raised
in Gapun had left the village (mostly because of conflicts over land rights and
sorcery accusations) and moved to the village of Wongan, which is a ninety-
minute trip from Gapun, by foot and then dugout canoe across a vast mangrove
lagoon.
     If we were to include those people in a count of Gapuners the total population
would be two hundred and twenty five. And if their children, most of whom were
born and raised in Wongan, were to be included, the number of people who could
reasonably claim to be a Gapuner would be close to three hundred.
     Any way Gapuners are counted, it is clear that their numbers have doubled
over the past twenty years. However, during that same time, old people have died
and children have continued to learn Tok Pisin as their first language. By 2009,
fewer than twenty people still living in Gapun had grown up with Tayap as their
first language.https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-001

"     Furthermore, the population of Gapun village is overwhelmingly young:
ninety percent of the total population is under forty years old, and only three
people in the village are over sixty years old. Today only about sixty people
actively command Tayap and only about forty five use the language to any extent
in their day-to-day lives.
     This grammar and dictionary is an attempt to document and preserve a small
part of the linguistic heritage of the Gapun people. Its publication will without
doubt have little or no impact on Tayap’s impending demise. Gapuners of today
have little need for their vernacular. They also have little desire for it – even
though no villager ever openly acknowledges this.
     Many instances of language death around the world start when adults more
or less consciously neglect to teach their home language to their children because
they want the children to succeed in school or because the home language is
socially stigmatized. This is not the situation in Gapun. No one in Gapun has
ever explicitly rejected Tayap, and no one disparages it or suggests that it should
be forgotten. On the contrary, Gapuners all express positive sentiments towards
their vernacular language. They all say they like it. Older adults occasionally flare
up and berate young people and children for not knowing it.
                    General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun   3
     But despite positive sentiments toward Tayap, day-to-day village life is now
overwhelmingly conducted in Tok Pisin. Village-wide meetings are in Tok Pisin,
church services are in Tok Pisin, gatherings in the men’s house are in Tok Pisin,
chatter on the field during soccer matches is in Tok Pisin, talk among women
visiting new mothers in maternity houses is in Tok Pisin. Informal conversations
involving villagers over thirty-five often involve code-switching between Tayap
and Tok Pisin, depending on who is present. But most conversations in Gapun,
between most people, take place mostly in Tok Pisin. Even private, intimate con-
versations occur overwhelmingly in Tok Pisin: young men who go off together in
groups to engage in secret rituals that make them feel lighter and more attractive
speak Tok Pisin to one another. Husbands and wives under thirty, when they are
alone together, speak Tok Pisin – a fact I know because when I asked a husband
or a wife to give me their opinion on their spouse’s competence in Tayap, they
usually answered that they couldn’t, because they almost never heard their
spouse speak Tayap.
     When villagers panic – for example when a drunken young man hurls himself
through the village swinging a machete at anyone he sees, or when a child is
bitten by a death adder in the middle of the village and no one knows where it
went – on occasions like those, the overwhelming bulk of everyone’s alarmed
screams to one another, tellingly, is in Tok Pisin, not Tayap.
     Equally tellingly, even senior villagers’ admonitions to younger people to
speak Tayap tend to be shouted in Tok Pisin. There is never any consistent effort
to teach children Tayap; indeed, whenever young people do occasionally attempt
to say something in it, any adult who hears them will often dismiss them with
a chuckle or a sneer, and loudly bemoan how poorly they speak the vernacular
language.
     Language loss is inevitably linked to cultural change, and during the past
few decades, Gapun has changed dramatically. The changes have not been eco-
nomic: Gapun villagers of today are not materially much better off than their great-
grandparents. Nor are villagers radically different from their post-war predecessors
in terms of their understandings of their place in the world: like their grandpar-
ents, today’s villagers still believe that Papua New Guineans are “the last country”
and that one day, hopefully soon, Jesus will return to Earth and bestow upon them
all the goods and riches that they believe He has already rewarded white people
with, everywhere else in the world. (The complexity of all this is the subject of my
two anthropological monographs on the village, Kulick 1992 and Kulick 2019.)
     What makes villagers of today very different from the generation born in
the 1940s and earlier is that the overwhelming majority of the social, cultural
and ritual practices that link them to their history have vanished. The men’s
house cult, which for generations was the backbone of Gapun culture, is broken.
4       1 The Tayap language and its speakersPreviously important social bonds – for example, relations between joking kin,
which are inherited relations to certain members of the clans into which one may
marry (njakum in Tayap, “wanpilai” in Tok Pisin) – are no longer observed and for
the most part no longer even known. Traditional healing rites, which depended
on knowing, respecting, flattering and sometimes threatening the spirits of ances-
tors and the powers of the rainforest, are now all regarded as suspicious at best
and Satanic at worst. Funerary rituals, which once engaged entire villages and
were occasions for important social gatherings, great feasts and the momentous
playing of the sacred flutes in the men’s house – these are all moribund.
     For the past fifty years, villagers have been much more interested in trying to
be good Catholics (villagers began to be baptized by visiting missionaries in the
early 1950s), trying to get their children educated, and trying to discover a way to
make money so that they can “develop” than they have been in talking about or
preserving their traditions.
     Like perhaps most people around the world, Gapuners care much more about
their future than they do about their past. And a price they seem destined to pay
for their enthusiastic orientation towards the future is not only the loss of their
traditions and history, but also the loss of their ancestral language.
     The death of languages is a phenomenon that linguists, anthropologists
and activists for indigenous and ethnic rights have long been aware of, and con-
cerned about. Much early linguistic and anthropological work was devoted to
“salvaging” what could be documented of traditions and languages that were
fading to extinction in the early decades of the twentieth century. During the past
twenty years, however, awareness of language death has turned from concern to
alarm.
     Linguists have realized that languages are becoming extinct at a rate seem-
ingly unprecedented in history. It is sobering to realize, for example, that ninety
percent of the indigenous languages spoken upon Cook’s arrival in Australia are
either dead or on the verge of dying. One overview has called the United States
“a graveyard for hundreds of languages” (Nettle and Romaine 2000: 5), noting
that eighty percent of the indigenous languages that still even exist there are
no longer being learned by children. Thirty percent of the languages spoken in
South America are thought to be “no longer viable”. And so on. The most widely
cited estimate of language death is the ominous prediction that ninety percent of
the world’s approximately six thousand languages are endangered (Krauss 1992,
Evans 2010). This figure, which at first glance seems hyperbolic and unbeliev-
able, becomes more comprehensible the moment it is realized that most people
in the world speak one or more of the one hundred largest languages. Those
big languages, linguists claim, are spoken by ninety six percent of the world’s
population.
                      General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun          5
    This means that four percent of the world’s population speaks the over-
whelming majority of the world’s languages. And those languages – thousands of
them, many of them undocumented – are believed to be in danger of vanishing
within the next one hundred years.
    Tayap is one of those languages. And in the literature on language death that
began burgeoning in the 1990s, it has sometimes been featured as a poignant
example. It is discussed, for example, in Daniel Nettle and Suzanne Romaine’s
comprehensive overview of language extinction around the world. Those lin-
guists cite my earlier work on Gapun (employing the spelling of “Tayap” that I
used previously; Kulick 1992) to make the point that:    Taiap is an amazingly rich language in terms of its structural diversity and particularly
    distinctive vocabulary, unlike any other in the Sepik. It is not clearly related to any other
    language in the area or indeed to any other language in Papua New Guinea as far as we can
    tell. (2000:13)
This celebration of Tayap’s uniqueness and complexity is a buildup that leads
to a somber punchline: “While further research might provide clues about the
precise genetic relationship between Taiap and other languages, this is unlikely
to happen. Taiap is dying”, write Nettle and Romaine, employing a baleful tone
that is characteristic of work on language death around the world.
     No one could dispute that the disappearance of a human language is a cause
for lamentation and mourning. And it would be insensitive and beside the point
to critique linguists’ attempts to inform a wider public about the widespread lan-
guage extinction that appears to be occurring across the globe today. But even
as we acknowledge and appreciate this, it is still possible to be skeptical of what
has emerged as a dominant way in which linguists discuss language death –
the likening of endangered languages to endangered animals and endangered
plants.
     Nettle and Romaine, for example, liken Tayap to a great bird. They write, “if
Taiap were a rare species of bird or Ubykh [another endangered language they
discuss] a dying coral reef, maybe more people would know of their plight and
be concerned”. And they continue, asking dramatically, “Should we be any less
concerned about Taiap than we are about the passing of the California condor?”
(2000: 13–14).
     A question like that is difficult to answer, not least because it is far from
obvious what “our” concern that Tayap is dying might actually materialize in prac-
tice, and what consequences those material expressions of “our” concern might
have for anyone living in Gapun. There is also a problem with likening Tayap to a
condor because exquisite as languages may be, they really are not like condors or
6       1 The Tayap language and its speakerscoral reefs. Condor chicks are not sent to schools where they are taught in a cos-
mopolitan language they’ve barely ever heard, and where they learn to devalue
their traditional condor ways. Coral reefs are not converted to Christianity and
told that their traditional reef ways are Satanic.
     To be fair, none of these things happen to languages either. But they do
happen to speakers of many of the languages that linguists are so concerned
about. Linguists like Nettle and Romaine who use species metaphors under-
stand this, of course. But in the current cultural climate that exhorts people
to develop concern for the environment and sustainability, many linguists
seem to believe that they can elicit some kind of sympathy and support for
dying languages if they talk about them in terms of biodiversity and species
loss.
     This way of thinking about language death is specious, however, because
it directs our attention to the natural world. By encouraging us to think in
terms of ecosystems rather than political systems, ecological or species met-
aphors elide, or at least defer, the simple realization that language death is
anything but a natural phenomenon. On the contrary, it is a profoundly social
phenomenon.
     Languages die because people stop speaking them, not because they exhaust
themselves in the fullness of time or are killed off by predatory languages of
greater phonological scope or syntactic richness.
     A better metaphor for language death, instead of seeing languages as
animals or organisms, would be to think of them like political movements,
philosophies or religions – that is, to consider them as social phenomena that
cannot be comprehended apart from history, beliefs, economics, desire, struc-
ture and power. And that necessarily change and sometimes even disappear as
the material, economic, social and cultural conditions that sustain them shift
and transform.
     With that in mind, and given the current state and tenor of Gapun village life,
I wish to make it clear that this grammar and dictionary of Tayap is not an effort to
influence the future. It is, instead, a record that documents what I am convinced
soon will be the irrevocable past. Gapun villagers are ceasing to speak their lan-
guage and if present trends persist, in thirty or forty years, Tayap will be gone
forever. While this is inconsolably sad, it is the villagers’ choice. It is a choice I
have no doubt that their descendants will castigate them for, as always eventually
happens with languages that die.
     But I do not write this grammar and dictionary with the fantasy that its
appearance will somehow change villagers’ lives and make them revive their
dying language. Indeed, I recognize that the opposite may – and at this point
probably will – happen. The appearance of Tayap words printed in a book may
                       General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun           7
foster resignation and complacency: a sense that, “Well now our language is all
there in a book, so we don’t really have to worry about it anymore, our children
can learn it from the book when they’re grown up”. Tayap in a book may also
solidify a view that the language is an august tongue of the ancestors far too
majestic and esoteric for young people to ever even attempt to master.
     So why write a book about Tayap? Partly to preserve some small part of the
proverbial treasure chest of human knowledge, certainly. But mostly, I have
written this grammar and dictionary primarily in the hope that a curious young
Gapuner, sometime in the probably distant future, will discover it somewhere and
value the fact that the obsolete language of his or her ancestors did not disappear
without a trace.
     The dictionary that accompanies this grammar is trilingual: Tayap, English
and Tok Pisin. A few of the villagers in Gapun have had as many as ten years of
schooling, most of it in English. Despite that, though (or, really, because of that),
none of them currently possesses anything but the most rudimentary command of
that language.1 No villager today will be able to make much sense of this grammar
of Tayap, but the dictionary part of this work may be entertaining and useful to
them now, as opposed to some distant future. And to facilitate that usefulness, I
have included definitions in the language that is replacing Tayap and in which all
villagers are fluent: Tok Pisin.
     I have also provided many examples of how the words in the dictionary
are used in Tayap, and I have purposely included a large number of vulgarities.
Gapun villagers are no different from anyone else who has ever scoured a dictio-
nary to see if it dared to list the most obscene terms that one and one’s sniggering
friends could dream up. I hope that the shock of seeing some of their most vulgar
words and insults immortalized in a book will provide the villagers with a great
deal of guilty pleasure.
     This grammar and dictionary should be of interest to linguists who study
Sepik and Ramu languages and the genealogical relationships of Papuan lan-
guages more generally. It should also interest archeologists and historians who
study the peopling and linguistic diversity of the Sepik region of Papua New
Guinea.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"

      shell.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o be.sg.f|1pl.r
      ‘we used to take the coffee to a machine and shell it’In this situation the form is no longer a single phonological word but still a single
predicate.
     Serial verb constructions are composed of one or more non-final verb(s) and
a final verb. The non-final verbs are always formally irrealis, but the final verb can
take the full range of Tayap’s TAM inflections. TAM and subject marking occurs
once across the construction, on the final verb, and the non-final verb(s) are
marked only for their object, if transitive.
     According to Haspelmath (2016: 296), a serial verb construction is “a mono-
clausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element
linking them and with no predicate-argument relation between the verbs”. It is
important to make clear that non-final and final verbs are both independent, and
there is not a relationship of syntactic dependency between the verbs of a serial
verb construction. Instead, there is a sharing of features (TAM, subject marking
and negation). The differences between non-final and final verbs are positional, a
factor of where they fall in the clause, rather than related to dependency.","[250, 251]"

     V is a single vowelAlthough words can be generated from this schema with multiple V syllables, in
practice sequences of more than two vowels do not occur (see above, Section 2.2).
    So under this schema a word like aruat ‘thunder’ would be two syllables:
V.CVC.
    The position C5 is analyzed as a semivowel /w/ rather than a vowel /u/ for one
reason. C6 is only ever a stop: thus an analysis of C5 as /u/ would mean that CVC
sequences with /u/ as the vowel could only ever be followed by stops. This would
be a rather strange situation, so it is avoided here by instead positing a CC cluster
with /w/ as the first consonant and any stop as the second.

theory be distinguished from those of the shape VmCV, where mC is a prenasalized
stop, on the grounds that prenasalization fluctuates word-medially in Tayap, and
thus could be not pronounced, whereas if the segment in question is a nasal con-
sonant it must be pronounced.
      They can also be distinguished in other ways. So for example nam'bar ‘one’ has
stress on the syllable beginning /b/, not on the /mb/ cluster, indicating that the nasal
is a full nasal consonant rather than prenasalization belonging to the voiced stop.
      This analysis has implications for the orthography, and here the decision is
a pragmatic one: while it is possible to distinguish NC from mC medially, in the
orthography these are not distinguished. Thus, a voiced stop with no accompany-
ing nasal indicates a voiced stop, which could alternatively be pronounced with
or without nasalization. But a nasal and homorganic voiced stop cluster may refer
to a NC cluster, e.g. as in nambar, or it may refer to a prenasalized stop mC.","[54, 55]"

6.1.3 Class 1 and 2 verbs in young people’s TayapAll verbs that have different stems in their irrealis and realis forms pose problems
for young speakers of Tayap. What generally happens whenever young speakers
are unsure of a form is that they take the irrealis stem (which is the same as the
verb root) and inflect that stem with realis morphology – that is, with object and
subject morphemes marked for realis status.
174          6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs      So a class 2 verb like war ‘fill’ will be inflected as(6-15) a. *war        -ku                -n
          fill.irr -3sg.f.r.o            -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I filled it’instead of the correct form, which is:        b.   par -ku                 -n
             fill.r -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
             ‘I filled it’An incorrect form like *warkun indicates that the speaker is using the verb root,
war, as the basis for inflection. All young people do this, and this kind of error
demonstrates a central feature of how young speakers produce Tayap verb mor-
phology: they clearly perceive the morphological structure of verbs but they are
unable to produce them correctly.
     The speaker who produced *warkun possibly had a sense that the verb she
wanted is associated with both the semivowel w and the plosive p. Having heard
parkun (‘I filled it’), warkrutak (‘she will fill it’, or ‘you (f) will fill it’) and warkru
wákare (‘X won’t fill it) all her life, the speaker who produced this utterance
probably intuitively knew the different forms that this verb can take. She has not
analyzed the different sounds as signifying different tenses and statuses, and so
what she ends up producing is a verb that mixes together realis and irrealis forms
and results in an ungrammatical neologism.
     Young speakers who attempt to inflect class 1 or 2 verbs that they do not auto-
matically know do one of three things:
     The first thing they can do is illustrated by the above example: they include
both the irrealis and realis forms in the same verb. Other examples are *wurpukun
(instead of puwkun; from wuw ‘carry on shoulder’) and *woipokun (instead of
poikun; from woi ‘roll’).
     The second strategy is to conjugate the class 1 or 2 verb as though it were a
class 5 verb. This means treating the verb root as though it is invariant, and also
using a discontinuous subject marker in the non-future. So a class 1 verb like
kotar-(p)-e ‘ask’ becomes *kotar and is inflected as:(6-16) a. *kotar -tu -ku         -n
          ask.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
          ‘she asked her’
                                                        Transitive verb classes     175
instead of the correct form:        b. kotarpe -ku               -n
           ask.r    -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘she asked her’The ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n is a perfectly correctly formed class 5 verb
(see below, Section 6.1.7). The problem is that the verb in question, kotar-(p)-e-, is
a class 1 verb, not a class 5 verb.
     At the same time, however, it is important to note that anyone hearing the
ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n will have no trouble understanding its
meaning. The verb root kotar means ‘query’. It derives the noun ‘question’ (as
kotarŋgar) and the intransitive verb ‘ask’, kotarkɨ. Because this basic meaning of
the verb root is known to everyone, it does not make a great deal of difference for
comprehension if the verb is conjugated as a class 1 verb or as a class 5 verb.
     This kind of separable relationship between the meaning of a verb root and the
details of its inflection will likely lead to the attrition of class 1 and 2 verbs. When
it doesn’t matter is if a verb is inflected as mbuspiŋgɨn (class 1, mbus-(p)-i ‘send’)
or mbustiŋgɨn (‘send’ inflected as a class 5 verb), the less regular inflection will
inexorably decline in use in the speech of young speakers who have not learned it.
     At the same time as young speakers simplify Tayap verbal morphology in this
way – that is, treating verbs of other classes as though they were all class 5 verbs –
there is also a competing tendency to insert a p in verbs that do not take one. So
some young speakers produce forms like the following:(6-17) a. *moserpi -ku                 -n
          buy.r       -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I bought it’instead of        b. mose -nu -ku              -n
           buy.r -s      <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg.m|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘I bought it’
           verb root moser (class 4)(6-18) a. *andpi     -ku       -n
          follow.r <3sg.f.r.o> - sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I followed her’instead of
176        6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs        b. kandu       -ku           -n
           follow.r <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|2sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘I followed her’
           verb root andu- (class 3)Both (6-17a and 6-18a) are inflected as class 1 verbs in the non-future tense,
despite the fact that moser ‘buy’ is a class 4 verb and andu ‘follow’ is a class 3
verb. These cases exhibit the opposite of the tendency just discussed: instead of
collapsing class 1 and 2 verbs into class 5 verbs, verbs from other classes become
incorporated into class 1 and 2 verbs.
     There may have always been some free variation in Tayap on this count. In
the speech of the oldest Tayap speakers, for example, I recorded two words for
the verb ‘sweep’; one mburai (class 5) and the other mburai-(p)-i (class 1). The
difference in non-future inflection between these two verbs is the element that
directly follows the stem: in the first verb that is n or t plus a vowel, in the second
verb it is a p.
     So using the first verb, one would say that a woman mburaitukun her house;
using the second, one would say she mburaipikun.
     When I asked if these two forms meant anything different the oldest speakers in
the village told me no, they were exact synonyms. And that they were both correct.
     The co-existence of two different forms of the same verb suggests that there may
have always been some accepted variation in the classification of verbs as class 5 or
class 1 verbs. If this is the case, then it seems that some young speakers have honed
in on that variation and exploited it. They inflect verbs as class 1 verbs (i.e. inserting
a p in the non-future) much less frequently than they simply collapse all verbs into
class 5 verbs. But the fact that they can create class 1 verbs out of verb roots from
other classes shows, once again, that young speakers possess a broad repertoire of
grammatical competence in Tayap. What they lack is productive ability.
     The third strategy that young speakers use when they are unsure of how to
conjugate a class 1 or 2 verb in the non-future is to inflect it in the progressive
aspect. This often makes little semantic sense. But as is discussed in Section
8.3.1, the progressive aspect is an “easy” inflectional form – all one needs to know
is three things: (1) the irrealis stem form of the verb; (2) the benefactive object
(which in most cases will be -kwan ‘3sg.f.ben.r.o’); and (3) the correct form of the
verb ‘be’. This relative morphological transparency appeals to younger speakers
and allows them to use verbs they otherwise would have a hard time inflecting.
     Thus, rather than tackling the class 2 verb war ‘grate’, to generate the correct
non-future form parkun ‘I grated it’, or the class 1 verb o ‘shoot’, to generate the
correct non-future form pokun ‘I shot it’, young speakers telling stories about
their actions and adventures say things like the following:
                                                      Transitive verb classes     177

          ‘I (f) was grating it’        b. o           -kwan         -kut
           strike.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o - be.sg.m.r.s
           ‘I (m) was shooting it’These are perfectly formed progressives. However, the context in which they
occurred demanded the non-future tense. But by inflecting the verbs in the pro-
gressive aspect, the speakers who needed them were at least able to use them.
This phenomenon illustrates a general rule of grammatical decay in Tayap,
namely: the weaker the speaker, the more instances of the progressive aspect that
speaker will use (see also Section 8.3.1).","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"

NP – in this case a possessive NP. Verbalized nouns often carry an inchoative meaning.(3.27) ŋgu kapa weka numŋa noŋortakara

able to host realis/irrealis status and transitivity suffixes as well as subject and
object suffixes. A fully inflected verb can function as the sole word of a sentence.
    There are two major subclasses of verbs: intransitive and transitive. Examples
of each are:Intransitive verb(3-28) ŋgu pirok
       ŋgu     pirok
       3sg.f laugh.sg.f|1sg.pl.r

       ‘I saw you’There are no ditransitive verbs in Tayap (see also Section 9.1). Semantically three-
place predicates express the recipient of giving, for example, with the benefactive
morpheme:(3-30) is        -iata        -n
       give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
       ‘(you) give it to me!’However the recipient can be omitted, indicating that the verb in question is tran-
sitive, not ditransitive, and that the benefactive morpheme is an optional oblique
argument:(3-31) epi           i           -kru       -net
       tomorrow give.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
       ‘I (m) will give it (to someone) tomorrow’Benefactive objects and regular objects cannot coocur in the same clause.
     As well as being divided into transitivity classes, every Tayap verb falls
into one of nine conjugation classes, based on how verbs form their non-future
forms: there are five classes for transitive verbs and four for intransitives (see
Chapter 6).
     Verb morphology in Tayap is entirely suffixing, with morphemes for object
and subject added – in that order, apart from discontinuous subject markers – to
verb stems. A characteristic feature of Tayap verbs is that status is marked across
the verb multiple times. The stem must occur in either an irrealis or realis form.
In addition, the object and subject morphemes that get suffixed to the stem also
encode realis/irrealis status.
     This can be illustrated with an example from the transitive verb stem o, which
means ‘strike’ (and covers actions like ‘shoot’, ‘stab’ and ‘hit’). Note how irrealis
vs. realis is marked across the verb (in bold):

           get up’)Status2marking on verbs, while mandatory, does not always occur in predictable
ways. Realis morphemes can occur as part of a verb that refers to an unreal event.
An example is the counterfactual mood (cf), which is a prototypical irrealis cate-
gory, because it refers to events that never occurred, such as ‘If he had seen it, he
would have shot it’. However in Tayap, on transitive verbs, the counterfactual is2 Note that the negative verb requires irrealis marking, see Section 5.4.2.1.

grammar – for the sake of consistency with the pattern that is clear in transitive
verbs – are glossed as realis. In reality, though, group I subject morphemes are

"5.4.2.3 Near future (nrfut)
The near future is formed by suffixing morpheme -ana (-nana after a vowel) to a
verb inflected for future tense:

          ‘Are you (m) going to eat sago jelly?’ (if I fix a plate of it for you?)The suffix -(n)ana expresses intention (see Section 7.4). But Tayap distin-
guishes between a near future tense and an intentional mood. Pure intention-
ality, with no morphological marking for time, is signaled on both transitive
and intransitive verbs by omitting the subject suffixes in the inflected future
verb and affixing -(n)ana directly to the irrealis object marker (for transitive
verbs) and directly to the irrealis modal marker (for intransitive verbs). So
compare:

          ‘Would you eat sago jelly?’ (if I offer you some)
            Note: The gender of ‘you’ here is unspecified, since there is no subject suffix on the
            verb.near future
      b. yu mum akrutetanake?

         2sg sago_jelly eat.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -2sg.m.irr.s- -intent =q
         ‘Are you (m) going to eat the sago jelly?’ (that is sitting in front of you
         getting cold)The only difference between these two questions is that in the first example
(5-12a) there is no subject suffix on the verb.
     In practice, it can be difficult or meaningless to try to distinguish between the
near future and intention. Just as an English expression like ‘I’m going to leave now’
conflates the desire or intention to leave with an action that is about to occur, so
does a Tayap sentence inflected in the near future tense imply a desire or intention.
     However, the difference between English and Tayap here is that unlike
English, Tayap can also clearly morphologically distinguish between an action
that is intended or desired and one that is about to occur.","[173, 174]"
"6.1 Transitive verb classesAll transitive verbs belong to one of five conjugation classes. Class 1 and 5 have
the biggest membership: in the dictionary there are 76 class 1 verbs and 73 class
5 verbs, with the other classes smaller: class 2 with 23, class 3 with 21 and class 4
with 38 verbs.
     The classes are distinguishable by two interrelated patterned changes that
occur on the verb stem:1.   the pattern of alternation between the stem’s form in the non-future tense
     and its form in the irrealis status (for example when it is negated or when it
     denotes the future);
     and
2.   the nature of the stem changes that occur in the non-future
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-006
164        6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsIn addition to these two kinds of patterned changes to the verb stem, three of the
five conjugation classes – classes 3, 4 and 5 – also mark the subject twice with a
discontinuous subject marker.
     It was demonstrated in Section 5.2 how the root of a verb can be deduced from
knowing the form it takes when it is negated. With that in mind, notice once again
how the root of a verb like o ‘strike’ changes between the irrealis and the realis
stem forms, seen here in the contrast between future and non-future tenses:(6-1) a. future ŋguyi okrutak

                           shoulder.r
         ‘she carried it/her on (her) shoulderOnce again, note the way the verb stem alternates.
    This kind of alternation is patterned and consistent, and it provides the basis
for distinguishing class 1 verbs (that alternate between the Ø form of the verb
stem in irrealis and -p- in realis), and class 2 verbs, which consist of verb stems

that alternate between -w- in irrealis and -p- in realis (the hyphens indicate that
both phonemes can occur word-initially or word-medially, depending on the verb
in question).
     Contrast both of those verb classes with conjugation class 3, which is charac-
terized by a stem alternation between irrealis a and realis ka and o (depending on
the subject of the verb).(6-3) a. future            ŋguyi akrutak

         ‘he ate it’Verb stems in the fourth class of transitive verbs, class 4 verbs, alternate between
r in irrealis and t in realis. They also have an extra subject morpheme in the
non-future that alternates between -nV- and -tV- and that marks person, gender
and number. An example is rar ‘see’:

           ‘he saw the dog’The final class of transitive verbs, class 5, is the simplest verb class. In class 5
verbs, the stem remains the same and does not change between the irrealis and
realis statuses. This regularity and simplicity is certainly one reason why all
foreign verbs that get incorporated into Tayap become inflected as class 5 verbs.1
It is also why speakers younger than thirty tend to conjugate all transitive verbs
as though they belonged to this verb class.","[183, 184, 185, 186]"
"3.4.4 Adverbials of frequency and distribution and ‘not yet’Two adverbials in Tayap express frequency and distribution (-re), and the tem-
poral relationship ‘not yet’ (ŋgo wákare). Note the formal parallel with the loca-
tive =re (see Section 3.4.3 above and Section 4.4); presumably these forms, while
having different functions, have the same origin. The suffix -re occurs on nouns,
and always involves reduplication, as the following examples show.-re ‘every’(3-64) a. Yu nimenda nirakkut arore arore. Rorsem aikindaka ambukenɨ
          nirakkut? Hariap kwik nirakkut.

            ‘he hasn’t spoken yet’3.4.5 Elevational and positional adverbialsThe relative geographical position of objects and people is expressed in Tayap
much more frequently than it is in a language like English. When leaving
someone’s company, for example, one doesn’t just say ‘I’m going’, but rather,
‘I’m going up (in the direction of the rainforest)’ or ‘I’m going down (in the
direction of the mangrove lagoon)’. Similarly, if you have just arrived back
in Gapun from a trip to the village of Wongan, and someone asks you where
you have been, the correct answer is not ‘I was in Wongan’, but ‘I was down
in Wongan’.
     Elevational and positional relationships are lexically encoded in Tayap’s rich
set of verbs of motion, virtually all of which are being lost because of their irreg-
ular inflectional patterns (see Section 6.2.3). But Tayap also has a set of two free-
standing elevationals and seven positionals that are used to pinpoint the location
of an object or a person.
     Four of these are oriented according to a spatial array consisting of two axes.
                                                                   Adverbs      81

MANGROVE LAGOON                        down sire
     The vertical axis refers to the spatial elevationals of ‘up’ and ‘down’, for
instance being up in a tree or down on the ground.
     The horizontal axis refers to the geographical relationship between the rain-
forest and the mangrove lagoon. The mangrove lagoon that villagers have to cross
to get to the neighboring village of Wongan runs to the sea and lies to the north
of Gapun. The rainforest, in which the villagers live and into which they walk
every day to find sago palms to process and game to hunt, lies all around the
village, but most of the vast areas of their traditional land lies roughly south of
Gapun. In relation to the mighty Sepik River, which can be seen from the top of
the mountain where Gapun village was situated until after World War II, the man-
grove lagoon is ‘downstream’, and the rainforest is ‘upstream’. This is the sense
in which villagers say they went ‘down’ to Wongan and then came back ‘up’ to
Gapun. These directionals are relative to one another, so that when one has gone
‘up’ into the rainforest, one comes ‘down’ to Gapun village when one returns.
Note that the terms also cover all space within the village.
     The five other freestanding positionals are:    ari   ‘below’, in the sense of ‘down below’ on a slope
    ase   ‘beside’, ‘on the edge of’, ‘on the periphery of’
    aro   ‘inside’, in the sense of ‘enveloped in or covered by’
    ato   ‘outside’, ‘on the exterior of’
    osi   ‘on the other side’So, for example, in response to the question ‘Where is it?’, one might respond in
any of the following ways:

with the locative clitic =nɨ.    imin=nɨ          ‘inside’ or ‘underneath’ (lit. ‘belly’ + loc)
    kandaŋ=nɨ        ‘under’, ‘at the base of’ (lit. ‘base’ + loc)
    mbokak=nɨ        ‘on top of’ (lit. ‘surface’ + loc)

    sek=nɨ           ‘underneath’ (lit. ‘underside’ + loc)
    taw=nɨ           ‘beside’ (lit. ‘side’ + loc)
The above positionals are nouns that can occur on their own – so one can say:(3-70)   raw =nɨ         aŋgi wuk
         nose =loc dx.f be.3sg.f.r
         ‘it’s in front’But speakers also frequently combine locative positionals like rawnɨ with the free-
standing elevationals and positionals, as well as more complex elements like the
possessive-marked noun in (3-71a–c), to specify location. One of the tests I did for
positionals was to put a plastic box in the middle of my floor and then put a torch
(i.e. a flashlight) in various positions in, under, behind, etc. the box. Some of the
positionals I elicited in this way are as follows (Note: tos ‘torch’ and kontena ‘box’
or ‘container’ are Tok Pisin words):
84        3 Word classes(3-71)   a. tos     kontena =ŋa         mbwar =nɨ  wo wuk

            ‘the torch is underneath the box’In addition to the elevationals and positionals discussed above, Tayap has two
further spatial adverbials that denote relative distance: kemrak ‘far away’ and
menjikan ‘nearby’. Examples are:(3-72)   a. ŋɨ ŋgɨnana kemrak puŋgot
            ŋɨ       ŋgɨ   = nana kemrak       puŋgot

            ‘the plate is there near your leg’3.5 PronounsTayap has a single set of pronouns that occur in three different cases: absolutive,
ergative and possessive.
     The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the possessive clitic = ŋa(n)
to the absolutive-case pronouns (with some irregularities), and the ergative pro-
nouns are formed by adding the nominal ergative clitics (see Section 4.3) to the
absolutive forms, again with some irregularities. Note that bound pronominal
forms are listed below and discussed in Section 5.3.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104]"
"7.6.1 Expectation and impatience (exp)The particle awa, which occurs initially or in the case of (7-39), after the subject,
carries a connotation of expectation tinged with slight or potential impatience or
disapproval. In the 1980s, senior men translated some occurrences of awa for me
with the Tok Pisin word “watpo” (‘what for’). “Watpo” is a demand that one can
easily imagine being shouted at black plantation workers by white colonial over-
seers. In the speech of the senior Gapun men, it was an interrogative that retained
an aggressive or exasperated tone that didn’t so much mean ‘why?’ as it meant,
‘Why in the world…? or ‘Why the hell…?’.
224           7 Mood    By 2009, awa was rarely heard in Tayap speech, and the instances of the word I
heard in the speech of senior villagers did not express overt disapproval. However,
they did seem to indicate that what was being referred to was anticipated or
overdue. So note the difference in meaning between two sentences, one of which
uses the simple interrogative, and the other which uses the modal particle awa:(7-38) a.      Speaker A:    wek-ara
                             come.3sg.f.r-perf
                             ‘she has arrived’               Speaker B:    Ndamor=ke?
                             Ndamor=q
                             ‘who, Ndamor?         b.    Speaker A:    wek-ara
                             come.3sg.f.r-perf
                             ‘she has arrived’               Speaker B:    Ndamor awa?
                             Ndamor exp
                             ‘it must be Ndamor?’Another example occurred when an old woman was waiting for a piece of meat
to be heated on a fire. At one point during a conversation about other things, she
asked a girl who was looking after the meat:(7-39)   ŋgu      awa mborsip tandiu pipiek?
         3sg.f exp pork          well cook.3sg.f.r
         ‘is the pork cooked enough?’Once again, this question is not simply a request for information; it expresses an
expectation. In the next example, given to me by a senior man in the 1980s, men
in Gapun were ready to fight men from the neighboring village of Sanae. All pre-
pared to fight, the Gapun men could ask one another in anticipatory excitement:(7-40) awa ŋgɨ ai                -ki   -ndak?
       exp 3pl come.irr -irr -3pl.irr
       ‘Will they come?’; i.e. ‘Do you think they’ll really come?’
                                                                    Mood particles          225
When it occurs together with a negated verb, the sense of expectation is height-
ened. Contrast the following two sentences:(7-41)   a. awa mbet
            exp come.r.1sg.m|3sg.m.r
            ‘he should come’ (i.e. ‘I expect he will come’)         a. awa ai-ki              wákare
            exp come.irr-irr neg
            ‘he must have arrived’Because it carries a sense of expectation, this construction is similar in meaning
to the admonitive mood discussed in Section 7.3. For example, the following two
sentences both mean something similar:(7-42)   a. awa Kemma orasambgi nirru wákare
            awa Kem =ma      ora      samb =gi
            exp Kem =poss thing pl            =erg.pl                nir         -ru        wákare
                make.irr -2sg.irr.o neg
                ‘it must be Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the spirit world]
                that are making you sick’ (in Tok Pisin: “Nogut ol samting bilong Kem
                i mekim yu”)         b. Kemma orasambgi nirŋgarana
            Kem =ma         ora    samb =gi           nir          -ŋgarana
            Kem =poss thing pl             =erg.pl make.irr -adm.sg|1pl
            ‘it wouldn’t be good if it’s Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the
            spirit world] that are making you sick’ (same Tok Pisin translation as
            above).22 This example is marked by non-agreement between the plural noun (orasamb, ‘things’) and
the plural ergative morpheme (=gi) affixed to the noun, and the singular inflection (-ŋgarana) on
the verb ‘make’ (nir). One would expect the plural ending –ŋgroana ( so ‘nirŋgroana’ see Section
7.3).
    It is probable that this example takes the form it does because the plural noun orak samb
(‘things’) is usually treated as a singular entity. So speakers say:     ŋgan orasamb wuk aŋgi
     ŋgan        orak      samb     wuk           aŋgi
     3pl.poss    thing     pl       be.3sg.f.r    dx
     ‘their things are there’ (lit. ‘their things is there’)
226         7 MoodAlthough they clearly are not identical in meaning, sentences like these two both
express an anxiety in relation to, or an expectation about, an event.","[243, 244, 245, 246]"
"Grammatical words generally coincide with phonological words in Tayap
(however see Section 8.2, example (8–3) for a counter-example). Grammatical
words consist of “a number of grammatical elements which (i) always occur
together rather than scattered throughout the clause (…); (ii) occur in fixed order;
and (iii) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning” (Aikhenvald 2007: 2).
     In Tayap, verbs are grammatical words which minimally must always occur
with person and/or status marking except in certain restricted morphosyntac-
tic environments. Even the longest and most complex of the complex predicates
described in Chapters 8 and 9 consist of single grammatical words, sharing as they
do various properties like marking for arguments and/or realis/irrealis status. Thus
the example discussed in detail in Chapter 8, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, ‘she intends to
carry him down on her shoulders’, is a single phonological and grammatical word.
     However grammatical words do not necessarily have to be inflected. Verbs
are normally inflected, but nouns, pronouns, particles and other minor classes
can occur without inflection.
                                                               Orthography        45
2.8 OrthographyThe Tayap orthography in this grammar and dictionary uses letters of the English
alphabet that correspond to the language’s phonemes, with two exceptions: ɨ
and ŋ. The phonemes /ɵ/ and /ŋ/ would be difficult to render using the letters
used to write English or Tok Pisin. Tayap is almost never written, and any villager
who does so invents his or her own nonce orthography. In my years of contact with
the villagers, I have received many letters from them, always written in Tok Pisin.
At the very end of these letters, though, after the writer has finished asking me for
money (which is always the sole reason for sending me a letter), he or she often
concludes with a line written in Tayap, to add coercive punch to the requests.
     A typical example is the phrase Aowo grag engon yu na na, which occurred at
the very end of a letter that had just instructed me to send the writer the equiva-
lent of $8,000 (at a time when the yearly income for the entire village was about
$500). The interjection aowo is an orthographic rendering of a sound used by
villagers to convey worry and longing, and the rest, ‘good evening to you’, is a
Tayap calque of Tok Pisin’s “gutpela apinun long yu”. The unambiguous meaning
of the Tayap phrase is: ‘I worry about you, so now you worry about me and send
me eight thousand dollars’.
     The orthography that villagers have come up with to write Tayap varies from
writer to writer and from occasion to occasion. However, one convention that has
developed over the years regards /ɵ/, which is sometimes written as h, and /ŋ/,
which is often rendered as either nh or ngh. This convention may be the invention
of Amburi Waiki, who was in his late twenties and the village prayer leader in the
mid-1980s. Amburi was the only person in Gapun to write anything in Tayap at
that time, and his orthography – which he himself applied erratically – was seen
by others and perhaps adopted by them. (What Amburi wrote on loose pages and
in school workbooks were the names of villagers who had contributed money to
the village church, and the names of areas of rainforest that he wanted to note
down for various reasons.)
     This way of handling Tayap’s phonemes results in a sentence like the follow-
ing, which Amburi wrote down for me in the 1980s: Ngha nghing ana mbet (‘I have
come for them’).
     The problem with the orthography used to write this sentence is that it is
difficult for villagers to parse and read. It makes no distinction between free and
bound morphemes (-ana, ‘for’ or ‘to’, for example, is a bound morpheme that
cannot occur on its own), and literate villagers, who have learned to read by being
drilled in school with texts in English, have difficulty with the sheer number of
letters used to denote simple sounds. (In the orthography used in this grammar
and dictionary the sentence would be written Ŋa ŋgɨnana mbet.)
46        2 Phonology and orthography      A sentence produced in 2009 by a literate villager who I asked to demonstrate
to me how he would write something in Tayap shows that the same problems
have persisted: Nhang nhan patir engon nhayar (‘My house is very nice’). The
orthography is internally inconsistent – the word written engon is pronounced
[εŋgɔn], and thus should be written enhgon, if the conventions of this orthogra-
phy were followed consistently.
      This orthography also quickly gets messy. For example, in the sentence just
quoted, a common word like ŋaŋan (‘my’) is written as two words and spelled
nhang nhan. In other instances, simple pronouns like ŋɨ [ŋɵ] (‘he’) and ŋgɨ [ŋgɵ]
(‘they’) tend to stump village writers, who might write them as nghi and nghgh,
respectively – although they would more likely avoid writing them or give up
trying to write them.
      Words with the consonant cluster /ŋg/ also pose difficulties. A name like
‘Saŋgi’ – which the villagers’ orthography should render as something like
Sanhgi – looks strange to the villagers when they see it written out in this way
(they would in this case write ‘Sangi’). Worse, a name like ‘Saŋgiŋgi’, which
might be written something like Sanhginhgi, would make villagers who try to use
their invented orthography throw up their hands in despair.
      Because of those difficulties, which villagers perceive and talk about them-
selves, I do not adopt their orthographic inventions to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/. Instead, I
introduce two additional letters, ɨ and ŋ. These letters are ordered so that ɨ follows
i in the alphabet, and ŋ follows n.
      While I depart from the villagers’ attempts to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/, I do follow
their loose convention of orthographically marking prenasalization on the voiced
word-initial stops /b/ and /d/ and on the affricate /dʒ/. Villagers vary on whether
or not they orthographically mark word-initial nasalization on the velar stop
/g/: a word like ‘cassowary’, spelled ŋgat in this orthography, would probably be
written ngat by most villagers.
      On the other hand, though, some of them write ŋgrag ‘evening’ as grag (see
above, the example of a villager’s letter asking me for $8,000). Regardless of how
they would write a word-initial /g/, however, Tayap speakers consistently prena-
salize the phoneme when they pronounce it in this position. Hence, I mark this
in the orthography.
      This concession to village pronunciation and writing conventions means that
the orthography used here is not as economical as it otherwise might have been.
I could have omitted the nasalization in words beginning with /b/, /d/, /j/ and
/g/ and simply noted that those phonemes are all obligatorily nasalized word-
initially (this is what Christopher Stroud and I did in our 1993 sketch grammar).
      In the end, though, I decided that since the only people who might conceiv-
ably ever actually use the orthography employed here are the speakers of Tayap,
                                                                 Orthography        47
their perceptual biases and already-established habits were more important than
an economical orthography. As I just noted, villagers who write anything in Tayap
vary in whether or not they mark the prenasalization before a word-initial /g/. But
they would find it counter-intuitive and odd to see or write bor ‘pig’, je ‘dog’ or der
‘path’ when they say – and would write – mbor, nje and nder.
     I therefore write words the way the villagers pronounce them, with the result
that there are no words in the dictionary that begin orthographically with b, d, j
or g.
     Word-medial and word-final prenasalized consonants are written as they are
most commonly pronounced, thus the j in munje ‘man’ is written as prenasalized,
as it is normally pronounced, versus mbubujiram ‘bubbles from fish, crocodiles,
turtles emerging from underwater’, which is written unprenasalized.
     This orthographic convention would also logically entail changing the spell-
ing of the villagers’ home, Gapun, to Ŋgapun. However, ‘Gapun’ is not a Tayap
word. Senior men in the 1980s told me that they had heard that Germans had
given the name Gapun to their village – which is called Tayap num ‘Tayap village’
in Tayap.
     No one knows why ‘Gapun’ was chosen, but the most likely explanation is
that when German cartographers and labor recruiters first appeared in the lower
Sepik area in the early decades of the 1900s, they asked coastal villagers the
names of inland villages which they could not reach, and they wrote down some
version of the names they received in response. The Kopar-language name for
Gapun, for example, is Saŋgap.
     No great leap of imagination is required to see how a name like that, through
various mis-hearings and confusions, could end up as Gapun. A significant per-
centage of the colonial records from the lower Sepik area were destroyed during
WWII, so I have been unable to uncover any information that directly sheds light
on the question of why Gapun is called Gapun.
     But whatever the story behind the German naming of the village may be, the
spelling of ‘Gapun’ can remain unchanged, since it is not a Tayap word.
     Note that stress is marked where it is a property of a lexical morpheme (for
example, wákare (‘no’), but in the rest of the grammar it is not marked it when it
is a product of complex morpho-phonemics e.g. like kakúndara in (2-14a) above.
     Out of respect for villagers’ writing habits (and also to be consistent with the
analysis of the language’s phonology discussed above, where no VVV clusters
are permitted), I have also changed the spelling of the name of the language and
people from Taiap – as I have spelled it in all my previous work on Gapun – to
Tayap.
     Whenever villagers write their name for themselves, they always spell it
Tayap. And the word is a popular one to write. The front of one house near the
48        2 Phonology and orthographycenter of the village, for example, is adorned with large letters, painted in black
battery acid, that proclaims (tellingly, in Tok Pisin), NIU LUK TAYAP (‘New Look
Tayap’).
     Another young man, upping the linguistic ante in the direction of what many
villagers have understood is the even more prestigious language, used similar
material to paint the words NEW HOME TAYAP on a wall in his house.
     A young man with whom I was walking along the beach one day, making
the six-hour trip to the village of Watam to see if the local health worker there
had any medicine for a bad case of scabies I had acquired in the village (she
didn’t), paused at one point to scratch the words NICK OUTCAST PERSON K*B*H*
ROR TAYAP MUNJE into the sand. Translated, this means ‘Nick outcast person
K[ambedagam] B[lue] H[ill] child Tayap man’ – the K*B*H* part of the message
being a name the young villagers have given to their mountain.
     Nick’s scribble in the sand doesn’t make much sense in either of the two lan-
guages in which it is written. But that is typical of the way that the word Tayap is
used in young villagers’ writing: it is used more as a marker or a tag than as an
attempt to convey referential meaning. Nick’s writing is a slightly more elaborate
variant of the words Tayap ror (Tayap child), which is a popular tag that young
men and women like to carve into trees or add after their signature at the end of
a love letter. The words are modeled on the Tok Pisin word “mangi”, which used
to mean ‘child’, but which during the past thirty years has acquired the sassier
meaning of ‘young person’ or, better, ‘kid’.
3 Word classesTayap has two open classes of words – nouns (Section 3.1) and verbs (Section 3.2) –
and a number of closed classes:     3.3 adjectives                  3.8 deictics
     3.4 adverbs                     3.9 interrogatives
     3.5 pronouns                    3.10 interjections and affect words
     3.6 quantifiers                 3.11 intensifiers and discourse markers
     3.7 articles                    3.12 mood particlesThe properties of Tayap’s word classes are discussed in the sections below.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]"
"7.1.2.1 Intransitive imperatives
The imperative forms of intransitive verbs are the single most salient grammati-
cal feature of Tayap, both for the speakers of Tayap and for everyone else in the
lower Sepik area who has ever heard of the language. Whenever Tayap speak-
ers talk about their vernacular, they merrily tell anyone who is willing to listen
that Tayap “is broken into a woman’s language and a man’s language” (“i bruk
long tok ples bilong ol meri na tok ples bilong ol man”). If you want to talk to a
woman, they explain patiently, you have to use the “women’s language” (“tok
ples bilong ol meri”). If you want to talk to a man, you have to use the “tok ples
bilong ol man”.
     Anyone who has followed this grammar this far knows that Tayap does indeed
have a number of gender-specific forms, such as the difference in first-person
forms for intransitive verbs inflected in the non-future tense (a male says ŋa mbot
‘I went’; a female says ŋa mbok; see Section 6.2). But this particular gendered
distinction is not primarily what the villagers have in mind when they talk about
how their language is broken in two.
     Instead, the villagers who describe Tayap in that way are referring to a single
feature of grammar, namely the different forms that the imperative of an intran-
sitive verb takes when it is addressed to a woman or to a man. The dramatic way
villagers describe this feature of their grammar, however – that you have to speak
to men and women using their specific “languages” – makes it seem as though
the entire Tayap language is “broken” in two.
     The villagers’ exegesis carries the unspoken implication that even parts of
speech like nouns have female and male forms, and that both those forms must
be mastered in order to be able to talk at all. Non-Gapuners who listen to Gapun
villagers describe Tayap in this way always react with understandable dismay,
and they inevitably shake their heads in wonder that a human language could
possibly be so complex. Some of them then go off and augment the complexity
                                                          Subjunctive (sbj)       203
further, informing others that, in fact, Tayap is “broken” into four languages: one
for women, one for men, one for girls and one for boys.
     Gapuners’ story about Tayap’s difference from other vernacular languages
must have arisen because no other language in the area marks gender on the
imperative forms of intransitive verbs. This is a salient feature of language
because whenever villagers from different places meet, one way many of them
enjoy spending time is to quiz one another on what one calls common objects –
‘betel nut’, ‘lime’ (for chewing betel nut), ‘tobacco’, ‘pig’, ‘dog’ and ‘sago jelly’
are the inevitable ones – in their respective vernaculars.
     Once these words have been exchanged, many people then go on to ask
about simple verbs: “How do you tell someone to come?”, they ask each other;
“How do you say ‘go’?”. Anyone asking a Tayap speaker that question will
receive the spiel about the vernacular being “broken in two” in response, and
so the story about the bizarreness of the little language that really is two – or is
it four? – separate languages gets perpetuated and spread throughout the lower
Sepik area.
     Despite the hype, however, the imperative form of an intransitive verb is
a simple construction. All it involves is (a) a verb stem inflected to express a
speaker’s wish that another person do something – in other words, a verb stem
inflected in the subjunctive mood – and (b) a subject ending that marks gender
and number. So the imperative for any intransitive verb is formed in the following
way (recall that 2nd person dual uses the plural form; see the discussion that
precedes example (3-73)):                                  +   -tet (2sg.m.r)
    subjunctive verb stem         +   -tak (2sg.f.r)

cal to the stem form of those verbs in the irrealis status. There are exceptions to
this pattern (for intransitive verbs; transitive verbs have exceptions discussed in
7.1.2.2), however, such as the following, where the verbs have a subjunctive-spe-
cific form:(7-3) a. ai (irr) ‘come’ → we- (sbj, so: we-tet, we-tak, we-nkem; see example
         7-1 above)
      b. tutu (irr) ‘sit’ → tuto- (sbj, so: tuto-tet, tuto-tak, tuto-nkem)Verb roots ending in r gain the vowel e before the imperative ending, which is
also stressed:(7-4) a. rar (irr) ‘ look’ → raré- (sbj, so: raré-tet, raré-tak, raré-nkem)
      b. sir (irr) ‘descend’→ siré- (sbj, so: siré-tet, siré-tak, siré-nkem)If these exceptions only occurred in the imperative mood, it would be possible to
simply classify them as exceptions and maintain that the stem form of an imper-
ative verb is its irrealis form. However, the stem forms of verbs in the impera-
tive mood are also the forms that occur for verbs inflected to express an indirect
command (see below 7.1.4). This fact indicates that the underlying form for imper-
ative forms is a subjunctive wish – in other words, ‘You go!’ takes the grammatical
form of ‘(I want that) you go!’.
     For that reason, the stem forms of verbs inflected in the imperative are classi-
fied as subjunctive rather than irrealis, even though their realization in speech is
most often identical with the irrealis forms.","[222, 223, 224]"
"1.4 Young people’s TayapIn addition to language recorded through formal elicitation sessions and tran-
scriptions of naturally occurring speech, this grammar and dictionary is also
informed by fifty-six narratives from forty five young people aged fourteen to
thirty that I collected and transcribed between July and November 2009.
     I elicited these narratives primarily to see whether villagers younger than
about thirty had any active command of Tayap at all. By mid-2009, after having
lived in Gapun twenty-four hours a day for more than three months, I found
that I was still unable to accurately judge this. The reason I had trouble assess-
ing younger villagers’ active competence in Tayap during this time was because
whenever I asked young people if they “save toktok long tok ples” (spoke Tayap),
they all told me, sure they did.
     The problem was, I never heard any of them doing so. Once in a while I would
hear a young person utter a few formulaic phrases in Tayap, but this was usually
done to mark a situation as funny, and it was usually accompanied and followed
by laughter. It also seemed to me that whenever villagers under twenty-five
mouthed even a short formulaic phrase in Tayap, their tone of voice shifted to
suggest that they were imitating or quoting someone else, usually to mock them
(a big man’s Voice of Authority, for example). Much the same happened whenever
I pressed the young people who told me that they spoke Tayap, and asked them
to tell me exactly what kind of things they said in the vernacular. In response,
they would list a few words like mum and tamwai (sago jelly and sago pancake,
respectively) and a few rudimentary formulaic phrases, such as the command to
hand over some betel nut or tobacco.
     At the same time, however, Tayap does continue to be heard throughout
Gapun. Women and men over fifty use it habitually (even if they continually
code-switch between Tayap and Tok Pisin), and a few men and women in their
mid-thirties and older also use Tayap very frequently, even when speaking to
their children. Even small children in the village understand the commands to
go and fetch things, hit dogs, get out of the way, stop crying, etc. that adults are
continually hollering at them.
18       1 The Tayap language and its speakers     Given that it was clear that Tayap was still used throughout Gapun, for a long
time I thought that perhaps the young people really were quite competent in the
vernacular, as they claimed to be. I fretted that I just never seemed to be in the
right place at the right time to hear them when they actually spoke it.
     I began to wonder whether the reason I wasn’t hearing young people telling
each other stories or asking each other questions in Tayap was because maybe
they spoke it mostly out of the earshot of older, more fluent speakers. Maybe they
felt ashamed that they weren’t speaking it completely flawlessly, I conjectured.
Or perhaps the vernacular, for them, had become tied to particular social events
like same-sex gossip or hanging out in the rainforest – speech situations that
only happened when young people were alone in groups and away from nosy and
critical parents and elders.
     To see whether any of this was in fact the case, I ended up spending a
great deal of time with young people of both sexes between the ages of four-
teen to twenty-five. I accompanied young men into the rainforest on frequent
occasions, to go looking for birds to shoot with arrows or slingshots, and also
when they went off together in groups to perform secret rituals that refresh
their bodies.
     I also spent a lot of time hanging out with young women. One place I made
a point of doing this was inside maternity huts. Maternity huts are small, flimsy,
hurriedly-constructed little houses on stilts, set on the periphery of the village,
often near areas that villagers go off into to urinate or defecate. Women ready to
give birth walk to special places in the rainforest, have their baby, then return
to these maternity huts, where they are supposed to stay for up to three months
(even though most young women these days find excuses to go back into their
usual houses after only a few perfunctory weeks). During the entire period a
woman is in a maternity hut, no man is supposed to visit her or even set eyes
upon her and her newborn baby because villagers believe that the quantities of
blood and uterine fluids discharged during childbirth make a woman and her
newborn infant “hot” – that is to say, scalding, dangerous. Females are not as
vulnerable to the effects of other women’s “heat” (since they are, themselves,
“hot”), and female visitors drop by a maternity hut throughout the day, usually
accompanied by their younger child siblings and their own babies, if they have
any. They bring food, water and gossip about the goings-on in the village from
which the new mother is temporarily excluded.
     It was not gender-appropriate for me to sit in the maternity huts with new
mothers and other women, but the villagers regarded my enthusiasm for doing
so as just a puzzling, whiteman eccentricity. Everyone in Gapun was convinced
that I was going to get a fatal case of asthma from allowing myself to come in such
close contact with the heat of women.
                                                        Young people’s Tayap      19
     With this kind of danger in mind, whenever I wondered aloud in Gapun
whether I might be coming down with a cold or a fever, a villager was always on
hand to ruefully shake his or her head and remind me how foolish I was to put
myself at risk of bronchial collapse by sitting next to a woman who had recently
given birth. Sure, I might take special white-people’s medicine to protect against
the ravages of vaginal heat, they told me (this is how they assumed I could survive
the blasts at all), but sooner or later, they just knew, I would start spewing blood.
     Despite their expectation that I would soon be coughing out my own lungs,
both women and men seemed to enjoy my visits in the maternity huts. Men
enjoyed them because I took digital photos of the new babies and willingly
showed them to them. Before I began doing this, no adult man had ever seen a
newborn, so they were all deeply curious. Women always welcomed me because
I brought gossip and stories. They also liked looking at the photos I took of them
and their babies. I usually also brought along some kerosene that could be put
into a tin lamp, thus sparing the new mother and her baby pitch-black nights in
a lonely, wind-rattled hut.
     Because I spent so many hours in the company of young women in places
like maternity huts, and of young men in places like the rainforest when they
performed intimate and lengthy ministrations together, I came to see, over the
months, that none of these young people ever used Tayap at all. All conversations
between young people under twenty-five, in all situations, were in Tok Pisin.
Young people use Tayap words that are common in the villagers’ speech, and
that often don’t have Tok Pisin equivalents (for example, words for various birds
and plants in the forest). And they do sometimes use short formulaic phrases,
to provoke humor or to “hide talk” from any non-villager who might be in their
company or within earshot. But that is all.
     Young people do not converse, narrate, gossip, argue, tell jokes, discuss
erotic experiences or do anything else at all in Tayap.
     Once I understood this, I became better able to make sense of the mutual
recrimination that arises whenever the topic of language shift comes up in villag-
ers’ conversations. Parents blame their children for not speaking Tayap. They say
in voices dripping with irony that their children have all turned white and there-
fore they only speak the language of white people – Tok Pisin. Young people,
when mocked in this way, snap back that it’s the parents’ own fault their children
don’t speak Tayap: if they had taught them Tayap, they would be able to speak it.
     Young men and women also told me that they don’t speak Tayap because
they are ashamed. “They laugh at us”, said one twenty-one-year-old man, refer-
ring to villagers in their forties and older. “They’ll say ‘Oh, he’s someone raised
in some other village’. Or, ‘Oh! A whiteman child who doesn’t know the village
language’. They’ll make fun of us. So it’s hard to answer in the vernacular and we
20        1 The Tayap language and its speakersget mixed up.” (“Ol i save lap long mipela, ol bai kirap tok, ‘Em wanpela mangi
bilong narapela hap ia’. O ‘Ye, waitman pikinini i no save long tok ples’. Na bai
ol i wokim pani gen. Em nau, hat long bekim long tok ples bai mipela paul ia.”)
     I became curious to know if the young people’s lack of Tayap, and their shame
about speaking it, was due to the fact that they simply didn’t command it. So to
try to assess this, I began asking groups of friends, two to three at a time, to come
into my house at night to narrate stories in Tayap. Because I knew by that time
that young people didn’t speak Tayap to one another or anyone else, I expected
this task to be like pulling teeth.
     Instead, to my great surprise, it was like slicing butter.
     Not only were young villagers eager to narrate; all but the very youngest of
them were also able to narrate in Tayap. Many of the narratives were short, and
most of them were scaffolded by the narrator’s same-sex friends, who sat on the
floor with them and helped the teller remember what things were called and figure
out how verbs were inflected. But what emerged in the narrative sessions was that
all young people in the village have some active competence in the vernacular, and
some of them have excellent active competence – even though they never use it.
     Those young people who exhibited the highest-level proficiency in their
Tayap narratives (defined as speakers who spoke relatively unhesitatingly, used
a variety of pronouns, verbal statuses and verbs of motion, and who had a broad
vocabulary) constitute a kind of speaker that has not been discussed in the lit-
erature on language death. They are not exactly “passive bilinguals”, because
they are capable of active production – in a few cases, of relatively advanced
active production (Tayap Text 3, narrated by a twenty-five-year-old woman, is an
example of just how advanced).
     Nor are these young women and men quite the same as what the linguist
Nancy Dorian, in her work on language death in Scottish Gaelic communities,
once labeled “semi-speakers” (Dorian 1981). The young people of Gapun are
like the Gaelic semi-speakers that Dorian described in that they have perfect
passive competence and perfect communicative competence in the vernacular:
they understand everything said to them and they respond in culturally appro-
priate ways. But unlike Dorian’s semi-speakers (and also unlike the Australian
Dyirbal semi-speakers discussed in Schmidt 1985), young people in Gapun do not
use the vernacular in conversations with fluent speakers. On the contrary, with
the exception of lexical items and a few formulaic phrases like those mentioned
above, they never use it at all. The narratives I collected in 2009 are the only
times in their lives that the young people I recorded have ever told an entire story
in Tayap, and unless I return to Gapun and record some more, or unless some
miracle happens and the vernacular experiences a sudden renaissance, those
sessions in my house are likely the last time that anyone under twenty five will
ever even attempt to narrate an entire story in Tayap.

    Rather than calling them “passive bilinguals” or “semi-speakers”, a more
accurate name for this category of speaker might be “passive active bilingual”.
The convolutedness of that label seems fitting to describe a speaker who pos-
sesses sufficient grammatical and communicative competence in a second lan-
guage to use that language, but who never actually does use it, because social
and cultural factors make it unnecessary or undesirable to do so.
    Of particular relevance for this grammar is that there is a steady and stage-
bound grammatical erosion from passive active bilinguals to increasingly less
competent passive bilinguals. Some of this erosion includes the following:–   The five transitive verb classes become collapsed into the morphologically
    simplest conjugation class, class 5.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"

"Villagers’ debates and language shiftSomething similar to the ‘wind problem’ occurred with a word that I would have
thought was common and uncontroversial – the word for ‘rainbow’. One morning
344        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionaryafter a night of heavy rain, a large rainbow appeared in the sky. On my way to
wash my clothes in one of the village waterholes, I saw the rainbow and realized
that I didn’t know what it was called in Tayap. So I asked the first person I saw – a
fluent speaker of Tayap in his late thirties – what one calls a rainbow in Tayap.
     “Renbo”, he responded, without missing a beat.
     Um, no, I told him, that must be the Tok Pisin word – the Tayap word had to be
something else. The man told me that in that case, he didn’t know, and that I should
go ask his father, sixty-five-year-old Monei Mbanaŋ, who was my main language
informant at the time. I went off to find Monei and thus did my innocent query
launch a month of acrimonious debate from one end of the village to the other.
     I found Monei sitting on his veranda and I asked him the word for rainbow.
He pondered for awhile. He told me he couldn’t remember the word offhand; he
needed to think about it. He thought for several days. Finally, he told me that
‘rainbow’ had no single word in Tayap; instead, ‘rainbow’ was expressed by the
verb phrase akɨn tamtiek, ‘cloud is marked with color’. This sounded reasonable
to me, and I duly recorded it. But when I repeated it to other speakers to check
their reactions, I was universally met with disdain. “Em giaman” – ‘He’s lying’,
everyone sneered, using their favorite expression to dismiss another speaker’s
expertise in Tayap. Even though no one could think of the correct term themselves,
they all told me they knew that the phrase Monei had volunteered was wrong.
     Days went by and no one could come up with ‘rainbow’. Older villagers
explained to me that their parents and older relatives had warned them about
rainbows, saying they should never walk underneath one, because if they did,
their minds would become clouded and confused. But even though they remem-
bered these cautions, no senior speaker could recall the word for ‘rainbow’
that their parents and relatives had used while articulating them. The word for
‘rainbow’, villagers told me, “i hait” – it was hiding. (In the villagers’ defense, I
should note that rainbows are not exactly common occurrences in Gapun – I only
saw that one the entire eight months I was there in 2009).
     Eventually Monei’s old wife, Sopak Waiki, told me that she had a dream in
which the true word for ‘rainbow’ had been whispered to her by a dead ancestor.
The word, she revealed, was mɨnuomb – a word that otherwise means ‘large
round lake’. Sopak said that the way to say ‘rainbow’ in Tayap was to say akɨnnɨ
mɨnuomb utok, ‘a round lake appeared in the clouds’.
     I told other senior speakers of Sopak’s revelation. They were unmoved. “Em
giaman”, they all pronounced, impassively.
     A few days later, one of the oldest men in the village told me that he had
remembered the word – it was wagurmos.
     The other speakers’ judgement fell predictably: “Em giaman”, they all said.
They explained that wagurmos meant the white film one sees in the sky at night
                                          Villagers’ debates and language shift     345
– that is, the Milky Way. It doesn’t mean ‘rainbow’ at all. Many older speakers also
took the opportunity to disparage the linguistic knowledge of the old man who
had offered wagurmos. That speaker may be old, they said belittlingly, but he’s
“lapun nating” – he’s grown old without having learned anything. All he has,
people said, is “bebi sens” – the sense of a baby.
     Weeks passed and frustration grew. But finally, having heard about the
senior speakers’ search for ‘rainbow’, a young man in his 30s one day came and
told me that he had once heard his grandfather, Kruni Ayarpa, say the word for
‘rainbow’. Kruni had been one of my language informants in the 1980s; he died
in the early 1990s. For the last few decades of his life, Kruni had been universally
respected and vaguely feared as an elder who knew everything about Gapun’s
history and who spoke flawless and eloquent Tayap. The young man reported
that as a child, he had once been together with Kruni when women from the
neighboring village of Wongan mentioned rainbows, which are called mamor in
their Kopar language. They asked Kruni what the word in Tayap was. Kruni told
them that it was mamar.
     Rather than being a breakthrough, this word, too, was rejected. “It means
‘banana’”, all the old people responded dryly when, without telling them why, I
asked them to define mamar. And indeed, it does mean a kind of banana. But in
the end, unable to come up with a word or expression that satisfied them all, and
undoubtedly growing annoyed at my persistence in questioning them, the older
villagers begrudgingly agreed that mamar must be the word for ‘rainbow’ too,
since Kruni apparently had claimed it was.
     My own conclusion is that mamar probably was the Tayap word for ‘rainbow’.
Tayap and Kopar share quite a few nouns, because speakers of the two languages
have been in contact with one another for a very long time. The kind of slight
phonetic variation between mamor and mamar are common in the words shared
by the two languages. For example:                        Tayap                 Kopar
  crocodile             orem                  oreo
  cockatoo              kaimwa                keimwa
  turtle                pawp                  pup
  lorikeet              njijerɨk              njijerɨŋ
  hook                  pipiŋgabu             bibigabuFor those all those reasons, I have entered ‘rainbow’ as one of the definitions of
mamar. I recount the little epic of finally getting that word, though, in order to
illustrate the fact that not all of the entries contained in this dictionary will satisfy
all the current speakers of Tayap.
346        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionary     In fact, this inability to satisfy all the current speakers of a Tayap is a feature
of the language that may be contributing to its demise. I was continually struck by
how vigorously (and, to my mind, how gratuitously) senior speakers of Tayap dis-
counted and ridiculed one another’s linguistic competence. Early on, I stopped
trying to discuss Tayap in groups of old people because any discussion of any
aspect of the language would inevitably result in bickering. Speakers might even-
tually grouchily agree on whatever it was I was asking them about, but later on,
they would always arrange a private moment with me to heartily dismiss the
knowledge and opinions of their fellow speakers.
     While it escapes no one’s attention that Tayap is a tiny language spoken
nowhere else but in Gapun (and by Gapun villagers living in the neighboring
village of Wongan), knowledge about language is regarded as a private, rather than
a communal, possession. This way of thinking about language is an extension of
the villagers’ more general ethos of ownership. Gapun villagers would shake their
heads in absolute bewilderment at the persistent Western stereotypes about how
a rainforest-dwelling people like themselves supposedly eschew ownership and
share their natural resources in a kind of prelapsarian socialist ecological bliss.
     On the contrary. In Gapun, nothing is communal, nothing is equally owned
and shared by everyone. Everything – every area of land, every sago palm, every
coconut palm, every mango tree, every pot, plate, axe, machete, discarded spear
shaft, broken kerosene lamp, and every anything else one can think of – is owned
by someone (including people’s names and the right to bestow them, as well
as knowledge of myths, songs, and curing chants). Villagers guard their rights
of ownership energetically and they defend them loudly (see Kulick 1992 for an
extended discussion of this that is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago).
     This understanding of possession and ownership has consequences for lan-
guage: it means that the sociolinguistic truism of a common “shared” language
has little purchase in Gapun. In their own view, villagers don’t “share” a lan-
guage. Instead, each speaker owns his or her own version of the language. And
the older those speakers become, the more they regard their version as the proper
one and everyone else’s as “giaman” (false, a lie; takwat in Tayap). This absence
of a language ideology that regards a common language as something “shared”
means that speakers are predisposed to not regard the loss of Tayap as particu-
larly traumatic. Fluent elder speakers still have ‘their’ Tayap; if younger speakers
don’t possess a version of it as, well, “wari bilong ol”. That’s their problem.","[363, 364, 365, 366]"

            3sg.f shake.r -mod go.3sg.f.r
            ‘she shivered’The difference in meaning between these two forms is subtle. Speakers say that
the fully inflected forms – those in (9-36a) and (9-37a) above – are synonymous
with the -ra forms – those in (9-36b) and (9-37b). Some verbs – ‘jump’ for example –
regularly occur in both forms. At the same time, however, it is clear that the
morpheme -ra does not just link two verbs in a temporal sequence like the con-
junction –(y)a does (Section 9.3.1). Instead, -ra modifies both the verb to which it
affixes and the verb of motion that follows it, creating a new lexical predicate out
of two independent verbs.
     In an important sense, all complex predicates create new lexical verbs by
linking together a series of different verbs. But the difference in this case is this:
other kinds of sequences in Tayap create complex predicates by conjoining verbs
that retain their separate lexical meaning even as they link together in sequences
with other verbs. Their meaning is additive – each verb contributes its particular
meaning to the final compound construction. So a sequence like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨ-
takana (Section 8.1ff) that was discussed in the previous chapter is composed of sep-
arate constituents that each add their own meaning to the action being expressed,
resulting in a verb that means ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’.
     Complex clauses created with the -ra suffix, on the other hand, are not addi-
tive, they are transformative. A complex clause created with -ra is not so much the
sum of its parts as it is a new semantic entity. Although many verbs formed with -ra
do retain a transparent relation to the independent verbs that derive them, others
have meanings that are completely different from the two verbs that compose
them. So ‘faint’, for example, is wasowra aiki- (wasow ‘die’ + -ra + aiki ‘come’).7
     Another way in which the -ra suffix transforms verbs is that it reduces their
valency. Compare the verb worer ‘capsize’ in constructions formed with -ra, and
7 This suffix occurs on at least one noun: the way to express that a body part has ‘fallen asleep’,
as one says in English, is to use the derived verb sɨwɨdɨdɨmra okɨ, which comes from the word for
small black ants; so sɨwɨdɨdɨm ‘ants’ + -ra + okɨ ‘go’.

in serial verb constructions formed with a non-final verb + a final verb like those
discussed in Section 8.2:(9-38) a. ewar yimbar worerara wok
          ewar        yimbar worer          -ara wok
          yesterday canoe capsize.irr -mod go.3sg.f.r

          yesterday 3pl canoe capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o- go.3sg.f.r
          ‘yesterday they tipped over the canoe’(9-39) a. awin worerara wok
          awin worer          -ara wok
          water capsize.irr -mod go.3sg.f.r
          ‘the water spilled’       b. ŋayi awin worerkuwok
          ŋa =yi       awin worer    -ku                     wok
          1sg =erg water capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o              go.3sg.f.r
          ‘I poured the water’Notice how the first sentences in these pairs (9-38a) and (9-39a) only has one argu-
ment – the subject, ‘canoe’ in (9-38a) and ‘water’ in (9-39a). The second sentences
have two arguments – subject (‘they’ and ‘I’) and object (‘canoe’ and ‘water’).
     Negation on verbs marked with -ra is only marked on the independent verb
that carries TAM, but its scope is both/all verb stems. So the negation of a verb
like ‘jump’ is:(9-40) ŋɨ       pɨŋ      -ra     atɨ           -kɨ   wákare
       3sg.m jump.r -mod go_down.irr -irr neg
       ‘he didn’t jump down’ or ‘he won’t jump down’9.8.2 Cosubordinate constructions with manner suffix -kar (mann)Like clause chains constructed with -ra, those formed with -kar also add a mor-
pheme directly onto the irrealis stem of a verb that precedes a verb of motion, thus
creating a medial verb. Unlike the -ra forms, however, constructions formed with
-kar or its allophonic variant -kwar (the environment triggering the alternation
278         9 Simple and complex sentencesis unknown) maintain the separate meanings of the modified verb and the verb
of motion that follows it. The suffix -kar creates a manner medial verb, one that
answers the question ‘How or in what manner did X go/come, etc.?’
    Verbs constructed with -kar are constructed in the following way:      irr verb stem + -kar/-kwar + fully inflected verb of motionVerbs formed with -kar encode the simultaneity of both actions for the duration
of both actions. In English, this temporal relationship would be rendered with the
adverbial ‘as’, as in ‘They were laughing as they washed the dishes’, or participle
clauses, as in ‘Laughing, they washed the dishes’. In other words, the first action,
laughing, occurred simultaneously with, and continued for the same length of
time as, the second action, washing the dishes.
    This foregrounding of duration and simultaneity results in awkward literal
translations, as in the following example:(9-41) nda mbɨd non         rekɨ ai        -kar wek
       dm pain indef with come.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
       ‘she came feeling pain as she came’A more idiomatic translation would be with an English adverbial phrase; some-
thing that highlighted the experience of pain as during travel, like ‘In pain, she
made her way here’.
    Cosubordinate constructions created with the -kar suffix also highlight an
action or process that has begun and is continuing, especially when the con-
struction is used with an inanimate subject. In English, this kind of phrase
would use a verb of inception, like ‘begin’ or ‘start’, or a verb of intensifi-
cation or process, like ‘growing’ or ‘becoming’; for example: ‘his anger was
growing’.
    The verb of motion that follows the medial verb created with the -kar suffix is
most commonly either ‘go’ (okɨ) or ‘come’ (aiki), although any verb of motion may
occur in this slot. Examples are:(9-42) a. ŋgu    warak     -kar wek
          3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
          ‘she came talking’         b. ŋɨ       ŋgar          -kwar mbot
            3sg.m call_out.irr -mann go.sg.m.r
            ‘he called out as he went along’
                                                Cosubordinate constructions      279
The sense of development and process means that these verb forms can co-occur
with other chained forms, such as the -ra forms, for example:(9-43) minjike =ŋa        mbatep pwak         -ra    o       -kar     wek
       betel_nut =poss unit        drop.irr -mod go.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
       ‘the flowers on the betel nut (palm) are in the process of opening’This suggests that the -ra clause and the -kar clause are syntactically equivalent,
both equally dependent on the final verb wek ‘come’.
    The directionality of the verb of motion (‘go’ or ‘come’) can express a differ-
ence in meaning, as in the following:(9-44) a. toto andɨ           -kar      wek
          skin swell.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
          ‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (in various places because bees have stung me)        b.    toto andɨ          -kar      wok
             skin swell.irr -mann go.3sg.f.r
             ‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (from a central point and spreading outwards)This kind of semantic difference encoded by different verbs of motion may have
been more productive in the past, and subtle nuances may have been eroded and
lost over the course of the last few decades. Today, senior speakers insist that with
only a few exceptions, such as (9-44a) and (9-44b) above, verbs formed with ‘go’
and ‘come’ have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably.
     Chains with -kar are negated by placing the negative marker after the inde-
pendent verb. So the negated form of example (9-42a) is:(9-45) ŋgu    warak      -kar    ai      -ki wákare
       3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.irr -irr neg
       ‘she was not talking as she came’The scope of negation in manner constructions has to include the medial verb.
Thus, the negated sentence means that the woman probably still came (the sen-
tence probably would not have been uttered if she hadn’t come); she just didn’t
come talking.
     This seems to indicate that -kar (and in fact -ra) are complex verbal con-
structions rather than adverbials, since negation of adverbials would be
expressed with the negator directly after the adverbial, not as here at the end
of the clause.
280        9 Simple and complex sentences9.9 Tail-head linkageTayap makes extensive use of tail-head linkage, a phenomenon in which the
last verb of one sentence is repeated as the first verb of the next sentence. It is a
coherence device for structuring discourse and is very common among Papuan
languages (de Vries 2005). In de Vries’s terms, Tayap’s tail-head linkage is the
chained type, utilizing the basic complex clause structures of the language,
namely coordination and subordination.
     Some examples, which are taken from the Tayap Texts at the end of this
grammar, are presented below (see those texts for many more examples of this
phenomenon).
     The following excerpt is a continuous stretch of speech taken from a narrated
story that is presented in its entirety in Text 1. The repeated inflected verbs are in

           ‘It died and there…’In most cases of tail-head linkage, only the verb is repeated. The second instance
of the verb usually occurs with a conjunction marker to connect it to the clause
that follows. However, other material can be repeated too: an example is the
oblique NP repeated with the verb in lines (9-47 a-b).
282          9 Simple and complex sentences9.10 Complex constructions with the suffix signifying
     multiplicity -rar (ml)The final suffix occurring on complex sentences is -rar. This suffix signifies
that the action denoted by the verb occurred in relation to multiple objects – so
‘look at many things’ instead of just ‘look’, or ‘shoot at many things’ instead of
just ‘shoot’. The suffix -rar is always used on transitive verbs. The object mor-
pheme is always in the realis form. TAM is marked on the final, independent
verb of motion that follows the medial verb. Even though the action of the verb
happens multiple times, the object is still singular. So the structure of this form
is as follows:      transitive verb stem irr + object r + -rar + verb of motion inflected for
      subject, TAM and statusExamples are as follows:(9-49) a. tar        -ku         -rar mbet
          take.irr -3sg.f.r.o -ml come.sg.m.r
          ‘he collected several as he came’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)         b. o           -ku         -rar mbot

            ‘he shot various things as he went’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)If the object slot is filled by a ben object rather than a direct object, then -rar is
realized as -tar (see examples 9-49c and d below):      transitive verb stem irr + ben object r + -tar + verb of motion inflected for
      subject, TAM and status         c. kokɨr krar         -mba         -tar weke

Verbs constructed with -rar are negated by negating the final, fully inflected verb
in the series. And like -kar verbs, the scope of negation covers the whole construc-
tion. So the negated form of (9-49a), above, is:(9-50) tar        -ku          -rar ai-ki       wákare
       take.irr -3sg.f.r.o     -ml come.irr-irr neg
       ‘he didn’t come collecting several’9.11 Complex sentences in young people’s TayapYoung people use a great deal of tail-head linkage in their narratives. The narra-
tor of Text 4, for example – a twenty-year-old man with good passive Tayap but
limited active command of the language – uses tail-head linkage in fifty percent of
his clause conjunctions. Compare this with between roughly ten to twelve percent
in Texts 1–3, which were narrated by more fluent speakers.
     Subordinate and cosubordinate clauses are beyond the capability of most
Tayap speakers younger than thirty. A few of the most skilled passive active speak-
ers (such as the twenty-five-year-old narrator of Tayap Text 3) can use the subordi-
nating morpheme -re to produce ‘when’ clauses (see lines 26 and 51 in Tayap Text 3).
But hypothetical morphemes – like the counterfactual mood that often accompa-
nies it – are mostly dead, and in fifty five of the fifty six narratives by young people
that I collected in Gapun, there is not a single instance of relativization.8
     Young people’s narratives are strings of events presented paratactically –
X did Y, Z happened, Q did P. Sometimes, the events are narrated with no
clause-linking morphology, as in the following extract, from a narrative told
by a twenty-three-year-old man (hesitations, false starts and interruptions and
encouragements by another speaker have been edited out of this extract):8 The single exception is a complex narrative in flawless Tayap told by a twenty-nine-year-old
young woman named Mbonika Amburi (the same Mbonika who features as a six-year-old girl
in the opening vignette of Kulick 1992). Mbonika is the paradigm example of the passive active
speaker. She never speaks more than a few formulaic phrases of Tayap to anyone, and knowing
her well and seeing her every day, I had come to assume that her command of the vernacular was
minimal. After being astonished by the fluency of her Tayap narrative, I asked her why she never
spoke the language. She is ashamed, she told me. She feared that if she spoke Tayap and said
something wrong, the old people in the village would laugh at her. “They’ll criticize”, she told
me. “They’ll say, ‘You all speak Tok Pisin too much and so you don’t know the vernacular’. For
that reason, I’m ashamed to speak the vernacular” (“Ol bai wokim koments, ‘Tok Pisin i planti na
yupela i no save long tok ples’. Na olsem na mi save sem long tok ples.”)

which are typical of the kinds of errors made by young speakers), note that he
does not use a single coordinating, cosubordinating or subordinating morpheme
throughout this entire stretch of speech. The verb phrases that make up the nar-
rative are simply placed one after the other with no linkage between them. (The
final a of the nonce word taina could be a coordinating morpheme, but this is
hard to know since the word doesn’t mean anything.)
     Much more commonly than simply listing verb phrases one after the other,
young speakers link clauses with the coordinating conjunction -(y)a. Here is an
extract from a narrative about a pig hunt by a twenty-six-year-old man who is one
of the more advanced younger speakers in the village:(9-52)   … Ŋa motɨnɨ warukpeta mbet. Mbeta mborma ndow tankuna anpekuna

he uses is incorrectly inflected. The form he wants is nirkwanuk ‘she was making’.

        shit, blood. And [Tok Pisin] I called out…’This speaker has the typical problem with the class 3 transitive verb andu ‘follow’
(see Section 6.1.5). The form he wants is kandukun, not the nonce form he creates
by using the verb root as the basis for the non-future inflection. But regardless of
his difficulty inflecting some verbs, he nevertheless is able to link verb phrases
into a coherent narrative. He does this with a single morphological tool, however:
the coordinating conjunction -(y)a.
     This morpheme has been over-extended in the speech of most young speak-
ers to do the work of all coordinating, cosubordinating and subordinating mor-
phemes. The reason for this over-extension is probably twofold.
     First, -a occurs frequently in Tayap, as a way to link coordinated clauses (see
Section 9.3.1).
     Second, the suffix -a, especially when it appears in speech after verbs ending
in n – verbs like tankun and *andpekun in the narrative above – sounds a lot like
(and behaves syntactically a lot like) Tok Pisin’s conjunction “na”, which means
‘and’. That Tok Pisin is never far from the minds of young Tayap speakers is
evident at the end of the above narrative, when the speaker briefly code-switches
into Tok Pisin, precisely to link two clauses.
     Cosubordinate verbs formed with the multiple suffix, -rar, do not appear in
the narratives I collected from speakers younger than thirty, and verbs formed
with the modifying -ra suffix only occur when they have become lexicalized, in
verbs like worer-ara wok ‘pour’ or wasow-ra wek ‘faint’.
286        9 Simple and complex sentences     The only kind of cosubordinate construction that young speakers do some-
times use is verbs formed with the medial manner suffix -kar. A small number of
verbs recur in the different narratives. These verbs always encode motion, never
process or development, and they are verbs that have probably been lexicalized,
like rar-kar mbot (‘I looked and came’), mar-kar ŋgwok (‘they rowed away’), and
amai-kwar wek (‘I was searching as I came’).
     However, the -kar form remains productive for at least some speakers, who
produced verbs like the following:(9-53) a. mɨri    adu         -kwar *weske
          forest break.irr -mann come_outside.dl
          ‘the two of us came crashing out of the forest’; *weske has no meaning;
          the speaker wants uske, from the verb root aski-.       b. naw           apu          -kwar ŋgwek
          grassland burn.irr -mann come.3pl.r
          ‘they burned and came’; a morphologically correctly formed but
          semantically incorrect verb – the speaker was talking about men
          lighting fire to a grassland to drive game out towards men waiting
          with spears, and she wants otar war-kwar ŋgwek: ‘fire light.irr-mann
          come’; lit. ‘they lit fire while coming’.       c. ŋgat        sene am           -kwar ŋgwek
          cassowary two fight.irr -mann come.3pl.r
          ‘the two cassowaries were fighting with one another as they came’;
          the speaker wants the dual form of ‘come’, weke.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306]"

"This speaker’s use of the clause subordinating morpheme -re (Section 9.4.1) is
morphologically correct – that is, it is placed correctly after the main verb in a
clause that thus becomes marked as subordinate. But it is semantically awkward.
A more fluent speaker would tell the story using the coordinating morpheme -a
(Section 9.3.1) in all instances where this speaker uses the subordinating mor-
pheme. This particular speaker uses -re more than all other young speakers
combined. It seems that she has identified the morpheme as a synonym for the
coordinating suffix -a.
     Three other kinds of clause linkage appear in young people’s narratives. The
first is the use of the perfect suffix to coordinate clauses, discussed in Section
5.4.3.2.
     The second is linkage accomplished with the word ‘okay’, which has become
part of Tok Pisin (as “oke”) via English.
     Here is an example from the narrative of a twenty-one-year-old man telling a
story about buying alcohol:(9-55) piatana ŋa mbot ŋgɨrekɨ oke Jastinŋi botol nambar mosenkun oke Simbɨraŋi
       non mosenkun oke ŋa ŋaŋan nambar kukumbota ŋgɨrekɨ akruna
       pi     -iata         -n           -a     ŋa mbot       ŋgɨ =rekɨ oke
       give.r -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s -and 1sg go.sg.m.r they =com okay       Jastin =ŋi    botol       nambar mose -n -ku
       Jastin =erg.m bottle (TP) one    buy.r -s <3sg.f.r.o>       -n                 oke Simbɨra =ŋi     non mose -n -ku
       -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s okay Simbɨra =erg.m one buy.r -s <3sg.f.r.o>       -n                 oke ŋa ŋaŋan      nambar ku    -ku
       -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s okay 1sg 1sg.poss one    bring -3sg.f.r.o       mbot         -a     ŋgɨ =rekɨ a                -kru          -na
       go.sg.m.r.s- -and 3pl =com consume.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -intent
       ‘…he gave me and I went with them, OK Jastin bought one bottle, OK
       Sɨmbɨra bought one, OK I took mine and went with them to drink…’
288        9 Simple and complex sentencesNote that ‘okay’ here performs the role of both -a (which this speaker uses profi-
ciently, as can be seen in lines 1 and 4 of this extract) and the clause coordinating
suffix -api, which links clauses that encode actions that occur one after the other
(Section 9.3.2).
     The third way young villagers sometimes link clauses is with the Tayap word
mai, which means ‘enough’, and the discourse marker nda. For many young
speakers, these two words have replaced the -api suffix as a way of indicating
that one action was completed before the next action began.
     This usage can be exemplified with an extract from a narrative told by a
nineteen-year-old woman:(9-56) …ŋayi wakuna wakuna mai, nda sowor ninkun. Sowor nitukuna mai,
       amayi mum nitukuna nda yim kakun uretrekɨ.
       ŋa =yi       pap     *wa      -ku          -n          -a

       ‘…I grated the coconut and, I grated it and enough, I made a boiling. She
       made a boiling, enough, then mama made sago jelly then we ate it with
       bamboo shoots’There are several grammatical errors in this short extract: the class 2 transitive
verb war ‘grate’ is inflected in a way typical of young speakers (see Section 6.1.3).
The expression sowor ninkun doesn’t exist – the speaker wants a verb, sowor-
pokun (‘I boiled a little’, from the verb root sowor-(p)-o ‘boil a small amount’).
And the speaker produces two different inflections for her *sowor construction:
                                   Complex sentences in young people’s Tayap      289
‘I did it’ (ninkun) and ‘she did it’ (nitukun), so it is never clear exactly who boiled
the small amount of bamboo shoots she talks about.
     As far as syntax is concerned, note how the speaker uses mai (‘enough’) to
express the completion of one action before the following action begins, and how
the discourse marker nda marks the beginning of the following action. This is
precisely the kind of clause coordination done by the Tayap suffix -api, and in
the speech of a fluent speaker, the young woman’s sentence would look like this:(9-57) ŋayi pap parkunapi, uret soworpokun

        ‘I grated the coconut, after I had grated it, I boiled a little bamboo shoots’That the utterance that this young woman actually produces in (9-56) is so far
removed from correct Tayap – in terms of vocabulary, verb inflection and mor-
phology – is sobering.
    It is a chill reminder that a tenacious and unique little language spoken by
very few people for a very long time is now on its way to oblivion.
Tayap TextsTayap Text 1: Two men are chased by their lover’s ghost
Narrated by Raya Ayarpa in 1987English translationI am going to tell the story of the old ancestors of Mbwadum. Once upon a
time (lit. before, in the old days) two men went to the Turuŋgwad clan. Kanjaŋ
village. For mangrove slugs. They were going to go and they went to their
lover and asked her: “Are you OK? We’re going to go for mangrove slugs at the
Turuŋgwad clan”.
     She told them, “The two of you go. I’m not a baby bird who is going to swallow
a seed and die”.
     Hearing her talk, they went. With their best dog, they went to the Turuŋgwad
clan. In Kanjaŋ village. Thus they went and the people of the Turuŋgwad clan
gave them gifts. They gave them the gift of two sticks of dried slug meat and they
sent them on their way and the two of them came back up [home].
     The two came up and went and came up to the Kirmar grassland.
     The woman too had died and her ghost went there. She went they came up.
They came up toward the grassland. They came up toward the Krimar grassland
and she asked them, “So the two of you come now, do you?”
     The two answered, “Yes”. They asked her, “Where are you going?”
     “I have children who are crying, so I’m going to Kandumsik stream to try and
net some fish”.
     “OK. You go on then, in that case”.
     She passed by them and put down her things, turned and cleared her throat
and said, “Who are you? Are you my lovers? It’s me”.
     They threw down their two sticks of slugs and then she chased them. She
chased them and brought them [towards the village]. She chased them and
brought them.
     The dog stood and was fighting with the spirit woman while the two ances-
tors picked up speed and came. The dog was fighting, fighting, fighting with the
spirit woman. Leaving her, he then came to the two ancestors. He came, came,
came, came, came, he came down to them.
     The spirit woman came close to them and he [the dog] stood and fought. He
was fighting with the spirit as the two ancestors came [towards the village].They
continued in that way [i.e. the dog and woman fighting, the men fleeing] for a longhttps://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-010

time in the forest far away from the village, and finally they came and appeared at
the bottom of Mbwadum mountain. They came up along the mountain.
    Children were below playing on the slope, they were shooting arrows at little
coconuts. They were shooting arrows at little coconuts when the two men came
up to them. They told them: “Call out to us!”. The children called out to them: “O!
O! O! O! O! O!”
    They [the men] fell and rolled down and died, their two bodies lay there
below. Their dog died together with them.
    The spirit woman, she had brought them thusly and she stood there and then
she turned and left them.
    Leaving them, she went away. The two men were laying there and they [other
men], thinking this must have something to do with ghosts, got a branch and spit
magic chants on it and as they were trying to bring them back, the two men got up.
    The others asked them: “What did this to you?”
     “The ghost, our girlfriend, chased us and came and her heat [i.e. her power]
affected us and so we died”.
     “OK”, said the others, “Come on then [back to the village]”.","[307, 308, 309, 310, 311]"

"7.1 Subjunctive (sbj)Tayap has a distinct set of verb forms that encode a speaker’s desire that another
person do something. The underlying syntactic structure in which a subjunctive
appears is a subordinate clause (i.e. ‘I want that X do Y’), but a separate set of
subjunctive forms can also occur in a main clause. Since those forms only occur
in indirect commands, they are discussed below in Section 7.1.5.
     The inflectional pattern for intransitive and transitive verbs in the subjunc-
tive mood is as follows:
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-007
                                                                    Subjunctive (sbj)         201
transitive verbs              subjunctive verb stem inflected as class 5 verb + realis subject
                              and object endings
intransitive verbs            subjunctive verb stem + realis subject ending
Below are the subjunctive inflections for the intransitive verb aiki ‘come’ and the
class 3 transitive verb a ‘eat’. To clearly see the difference between the subjunc-
tive and the indicative, the indicative inflections of those verbs appear in the two
right-hand columns:(7-1)                                                                       indicative

A verb like aiki ‘come’ notwithstanding, the subjunctive stem form of most verbs
has the same realization as the verb’s irrealis stem form. The exceptions to this
pattern are discussed in Sections 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2 below.
    The subjunctive in Tayap is used to express the following speech acts:
(a) direct imperatives (‘Take this food to Kapiru!’)
(b) jussive imperatives (‘Let her go’);
(c) indirect commands (‘Tell them to hit him’; ‘Make them go away’);
(d) wishes (‘I want you all to go to Sanae’)
Each of these four uses of the subjunctive involves different grammatical and syn-
tactic components. A direct imperative can, by itself, constitute a sentence. Jussive
imperatives involve the fixed expression ŋganokaw, which does not change for
person or number. Indirect commands can be expressed in two ways, one using
the subjunctive in both the main clause and the subordinate clause; and one just
juxtaposing two independent clauses in the declarative mood. The expression of
a wish, similarly, has several forms, only one of which involves the subjunctive.
202        7 Mood7.1.2 ImperativeThe imperative mood expresses a command that is directly addressed to one
person (‘you come!’) or to several people (‘you all come!’). In Tayap there are two
kinds of imperatives: positive imperatives – commands to do something – and
negative imperatives, commands to not do something.
     Negative imperatives have a particular morphology and are discussed under
prohibitives and admonitives (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3).
     Positive imperatives – a command that an addressee perform some action –
are realized differently for intransitive and transitive verbs.","[220, 221, 222]"
"7.6.2 Supposition (supp)Another particle, mera, marks the epistemic status of an action or event as some-
thing that has been assumed but that the speaker believes does not correspond to
what actually happened. In other words, it is what Tayap speakers use to convey
a meaning like ‘I thought Paita had gone to Wongan’. A statement like that in
English conveys a belief that regardless of whether or not Paita did go to Wongan,
the speaker expected him to but believes that he did not.
     The modal particle mera that carries this meaning follows whatever part of
speech is the focus of the assumption. So it can occur after a noun, as in the
following:(7-43)   ŋa ndɨ nda namnak Ŋgemanŋi mera
         ŋa ndɨ nda nam           -nak         Ŋgeman =ŋi          mera
         1sg dm dm talk.r -1sg.f|1pl.r Ŋgeman =erg.m supp
         ‘I (f) thought it was Ŋgeman’ (who did it, but it wasn’t)Most commonly, mera follows a verb, thereby reframing what would have been a
statement as a supposition. For example:(7-44) ŋa namnet ŋɨ Potore okɨnet mera
       ŋa nam -net                   ŋɨ Poto  =re
       1sg talk.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r 3sg.m Wongan =all         o         -kɨ   -net             mera
         go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr supp
         ‘I (m) thought he would go to Wongan’ (but he didn’t)Without the modal particle, this sentence would mean ‘I thought: he will go
to Wongan’. Mera turns the statement into an assumption that, moreover, the
speaker believes did not come to pass. Note that these constructions always
involve the use of a phrase like ‘I thought’ or ‘I lied’ as exemplified here.
    The particle is also to express the action of having been fooled or lied to. So
‘they lied to us that you were dead’ is:
                                                             Mood particles       227

         ‘they lied to us that you (m) were dead’ (lit. ‘they lied to us, you were dead
         we thought’)7.6.3 Mirative (mir)Kapa encodes surprise. It follows nominals and the closest colloquial English
translation would be the expression ‘that damned X’ in both its positive and neg-
ative valences; so both ‘That damned kid really did well’ and ‘That damned cat
peed on my sofa’. Kapa follows pronouns, nouns and noun phrases, as in the
following examples:(7-46) a. ŋgu kapa weka numŋan noŋortakara

228         7 Mood7.6.4 Surprise counter to expectation (cs)Nímera expresses surprise that a situation has turned out contrary to one’s
expectations. It is a combination of the adverb, ni, which expresses a negative
state – the state of doing nothing or having nothing (see Section 3.4.1) – with the
suppositional particle mera (see above Section 7.6.2).
    An example that senior speakers used to explain the particle is as follows:
You tell another person to complete some work and then you leave them, thinking
that the person will not do the work. When you return, you find that the person
actually has done the work, at which point you might say:(7-47)   ŋa ndɨ yu nímera kut                       inda
         1sg dm 2sg cs               be.r.sg.m.r dx.m
         ‘I thought you (m) just were here’ (doing nothing, but you weren’t, you
         actually worked) (lit: ‘I was like, you just were here’)Another example is that people have come to your house and you expect them to
help you do some work, but they don’t. You might say:(7-48) yum nímera a           -ku -nana      mbekem?
       2pl cs          be.irr -irr intent come.2pl.r
       ‘So you’ve all come just to be here?’ (and do nothing even though I
       expected you to work?)A final example is that you are carving something and you want to make it look
like an object you have seen before – perhaps a small statue with a traditional

8 Complex predicates8.1 Complex predicates and complex clausesIn Tayap, the major division in complex structures is between combining verbs
versus combining clauses. Verb combining in Tayap is accomplished through
complex predicates, which can be serial verb constructions or complex predi-
cates involving the verb ‘to be’. Clause combining is of three types: Coordinate,
subordinate and cosubordinate constructions.
    This chapter deals with complex predicates, and the following chapter
(Chapter 9) deals with clause combining.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"
"Don and Angela’s Acknowledgements:
We both thank Ger Reesink, who revealed himself to be the reviewer of the man-
uscript we submitted to Pacific Linguistics in spring 2018. In only a few weeks,
Ger had scoured the text with a gimlet eye and fine-toothed comb, noting incon-
sistencies, recommending literature, suggesting alternative analyses and – most
considerately – remarking on the parts of the text that he particularly enjoyed.
His knowledge of Papuan languages is unsurpassed and this grammar benefits
from it greatly.
     We are also deeply grateful to Tim Curnow who did us a wonderful service in
reading the final manuscript with what must have been a microscope, and pro-
viding us with almost unbelievably detailed comments. The grammar is much the
better for his thorough and meticulous input.",[9]

"9.4.3.1 How to form a counterfactual verb
Counterfactual morphology is quite specific. Intransitive verbs use their irrealis
stems, and transitive verbs their realis stems.
     The actual stem form of many intransitive verbs is the same as their irrealis
form. But other verb stems have suppletive forms. They change in regular ways,
but most of the forms occur nowhere else in Tayap (an exception is the counter-
factual form for o ‘go’, which is the same as that verb’s habitual stem, see Section
8.3.2). The changes to the verb stems are as follows:    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain e → wek
    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain o → wak
    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain i → ik
    class 3 verb stems, a → akexceptions:     (1) the verb ‘be’, a-, becomes awk in cf
                (2) the verb ‘marry’, ar-, remains the same and does not change
                    to ak in cfThe following is a full list of how counterfactual intransitive verbs are formed.

                       (in most cases this
                       is the same as the
ŋɨ ‘he’                stem in irrealis)                           -ret (cf) or -net (irr)
ŋgu ‘she’                                                          -rak (cf) or -tak (irr)

Note that the counterfactual -rɨk is always stressed, in which point it differs from
the formally identical progressive marker also -rɨk (see Section 8.3.1.1).
     The counterfactual affix -rɨk is optional in those cases where the form of
the verb stem in the counterfactual differs from its form in the irrealis. So, for
example, a verb like ‘be’ is realized as a in its irrealis form, but in the counter-
factual, it becomes awk. This partially suppletive stem change makes the coun-
terfactual morpheme -rɨk redundant. Therefore, it can be omitted. But it doesn’t
have to be omitted.
     The phrase ‘she would have been’ can thus be expressed in any of the follow-
ing four ways:      awk-rɨk-rak
      awk-rɨk-tak
      awk-rak
      awk-takTransitive verbs display a similar range of variation. They can be formed in ways
that either include or exclude the following morphemes in parentheses. Note the
realis forms of the subject and object affixes:

                                6.1.6)So a verb like ‘I would have eaten it’ has the following forms, all of which senior
speakers insist mean the same:2verb stem.cf + (-rɨk) + (-nv/-tv)           + object.r + subject.r
     ak-       -rɨk       -nu-                 <ku>        -n             →     akrɨknukun2
     ak-       -rɨk                             -ku        -n             →      akrɨkkun
     ak-                  -nu-                 <ku>        -n             →      aknukun
     ak-                                        -ku        -n             →        akkunAs with intransitive verbs, all these options for variation only apply to verbs that
alter their stems in the counterfactual. They don’t apply to a verb like moser
‘buy’, for example, because that verb has the same stem form in both the irrealis
and the counterfactual (since moser isn’t a class 1, 2 or 3 verb; see the discussion
above about which verbs change their stem form in the counterfactual).3 In this
case, where the stem does not change to express the counterfactual, the coun-
terfactual morpheme -rɨk is needed – even if the -nv/-tv subject morphemes are
optional.
     So the full range of inflectional options listed above applies to verbs like o
‘hit’ or wawar-(p/w)-e ‘hang up’, because to express counterfactuality, those verb
stems change and become wak and wawarwek respectively. In those instances,
once again, the counterfactual affix -rɨk is redundant, since the stem change
already signals counterfactuality.
     Negative counterfactual actions are expressed by simply negating the rele-
vant subordinate verb as in a main clause, and following this with one of the
hypothetical particles (most commonly ndɨ), then expressing the main clause in
the counterfactual as usual:
2 In the morphological combination -rɨknukun, the morpheme-medial n and u undergo metath-
esis, resulting in [ɾɵkunkun]
3 To lessen the risk for confusion, the verb stem of such verbs is glossed as cf in counterfactual
constructions, even though the stem is identical with its irr form. An example is (9-23).

reference of an NP by specifying the role of the referent of that NP in the situation
described by the [relative clause]” (Andrews 2007: 206). Relative clauses in Tayap
are nominalized, marked with the inanimate possessive clitic =ŋa(n) which
appears on the verb of the relative clause. This possessive clitic =ŋa(n) is added
to a fully inflected verb, which then functions as a subordinate relative clause.
The common argument or head (“domain nominal” in Andrews’ 2007 terms) of
a relative and a main clause can be in S, A, O or oblique function in the relative
clause and in the main clause.
     Tayap relative clauses are external. The relative clause generally directly
follows the common argument in the main clause. This is the position held by a
nominal modifier (e.g. adjective) as well (see Chapter 4).
     The common argument may also be expressed with a deictic (Section 3.8)
functioning resumptively with respect to the head noun, and typically following
the common argument directly: for example, consider (9-29a-b). In both examples
there are two resumptive pronouns, in (9-29a) following the relative clause and as
the final part of the main clause and in (9-29b) following the common argument
and as the final part of the main clause. Note that these resumptive pronouns agree
in gender and number with the common argument. They are not an obligatory part
of relative clauses: see for example (9-29c) and (9-29f), which do not have them.
     Note that the verb of the relative clause is fully inflected, and the relative
clause contains all the usual components of a clause. The relative clause may
                                                          Relative clauses     269
even contain a complex predicate: see for example (9-29f) which has a relative
clause with a serial verb construction involving kv ‘bring’ in construction with a
verb (see Section 8.2.3.1).
     Relative clauses would appear to always be restrictive. No non-restrictive rel-
ative clauses have been found in the data. In the following example the posses-
sive marker is in bold and the head noun in the main clause underlined.(9-29) a. nɨm puŋgokawukŋan aŋgi kopi aŋgi

            ‘I don’t know where they got the one they killed later from’
            Ie, ‘the one they struck later, I don’t know where they got it from’Relative clauses are not very common and the corpus contains few examples to
show whether the common argument is syntactically a part of the relative clause
or part of the main clause. However the main clause of (9-29d) can be negated
using wákare before munje (and changing the verb kiraw to kirawŋgrɨ). This sug-
gests that munje belongs syntactically in the relative clause rather than the main
clause. However more examples are needed to be certain.
    Tayap used to have another relativizing suffix: the morpheme -gin (or perhaps
it was a clitic =gin, there is not enough evidence to show). This morpheme seems
to be synonymous with, and occurs in exactly the same morphological slot as,
=ŋa(n). For example:(9-30) patɨr aŋgu ŋaŋan omoŋi perkungin otɨtekara
       patɨr aŋgu ŋaŋan         omo    =ŋi       per -ku

sions that I recorded in the 1980s. By 2009, however, it was no longer used by
anybody. 49.6 Finite nominalizations with consequence clitic =ŋa(n)Finite nominalizations are constructed, like relative clauses, with the possessive
clitic, and carry the meaning of consequence; that a particular state has been
brought into existence because of an action. For example:(9-31)   kokɨr mbɨdtia ŋaŋan noŋor kokɨr kratianŋa

         break.r -s <1sg.ben.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s =poss
         ‘my head hurts because my wife hit me on the head’9.7 Perception constructionsSentences that describe an act of perceiving, like seeing or smelling, can be
expressed in two ways in Tayap: either paratactically as two separate clauses, or
with a nominalized construction.
     In the perception construction, the perceiver is subject of the main clause,
and the person or thing perceived is object. In the subordinate (nominalized)
clause, always placed after the main clause, the action expressing the circum-
stances of the perception is indicated. Coreferential with the main clause object
is the thing perceived, which may be subject or object in the subordinate clause.
     The two possibilities are exemplified below:

                                                  Perception constructions      273
One argument, the subject or the object of the main clause, is coreferent with
either the subject or object of the nominalized clause. The verb of the nominal-
ized clause is fully inflected. These clauses, while marked with the possessive
clitic (as relative clauses are), are structurally different from relative clauses.
     Relative clauses modify NPs, and they occur in the modifier slot within an NP.
These nominalized clauses, on the contrary, while they share an argument with
their main clause, do not modify an NP but rather modify an entire main clause,
within the specific semantic domain of perception. The shared argument of the
clauses is expressed only once, in the main clause, while the nominalized clause
consists only of the nominalized predicate and any arguments.
     These are not complement clauses either, as the nominalized clause does not
function as an argument of the main clause, but rather as a modifier. This can
clearly be seen for example in (9-32b), in which it can’t be the case that the nomi-
nalized clause is functioning as an argument of the main clause. The main clause
verb has 3pl object marking, so the object must be the women, not the clause
describing them going into the forest.
     Other potential candidates for complement clauses, including constructions
of saying and telling, are expressed with verbal morphology involving indirect
commands (see Section 7.1.4).

            ‘I saw her going inside the house’In (9-34a) the main clause is Sopakyi Nik tatŋgɨn ‘Sopak saw Nik’, and the subor-
dinate perception clause mbor pokunŋa ‘[Nik] spearing the pig’. Thus the clause
structure as a whole is ‘Sopak saw Nik [spearing the pig]’. The clause is not mod-
ifying Nik, as it would be in a relative clause, but rather the perception clause
predicates what is perceived.

          ‘I didn’t know you (m) had come’9.8 Cosubordinate constructionsA further type of clause combining construction in Tayap consists of medial verbs
appearing with modifying suffixes and then linked to independent final verbs,
which are always verbs of motion. These are cosubordinate constructions, also
called clause chaining constructions: the terms are used interchangeably here.
     In these clauses, a medial verb appears in its irrealis or realis stem form,
without a subject marker, with an object marker if transitive, and one of three
linking suffixes: -ra (modifier), -kar (manner), or -rar (multiple), followed by an
independent verb. These structures form medial-final chains (Longacre 2007).
Van Valin and La Polla (1997) call this type of clause linkage cosubordination, i.e.
dependency without embedding.
     Nothing can occur between the medial verb and the final verb. Also such
clauses cannot contain cataphoric pronominal reference (i.e. cannot refer forward
to something in a later clause). So medial chains are not subordinate, but neither
are they coordinate as their medial verbs are dependent on the final verb of the
chain for status marking.
                                                       Cosubordinate constructions          275
     In all three types of clause chains, negation occurs once and has scope over
the whole construction.
     Tayap cosubordinate constructions differ from serial verb constructions in
that medial verbs have an obligatory linking suffix, whereas non-final verbs in
serial verb constructions do not, and serial verb constructions generally form
a single phonological word whereas cosubordinate constructions do not (see
Section 8.2 for discussion of serial verb constructions).
     One unusual facet of Tayap’s medial-final constructions is that they do not
typically form the long chains that Papuan languages in general are so famous
for. The majority of medial-final chains in Tayap consist of a single medial verb
followed by a final verb. This might be in part because the final verb has to be a
verb of motion.
     An alternative analysis of these constructions, in particular -r and -kar, is that
they are adverbial suffixes, rendering an adverb from a verb. However a cosubor-
dinate analysis is preferred here as negation operates across clause boundaries
to cover the whole construction rather than negating the putative adverb directly
(see below, Section 9.8.2).","[285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295]"
"These tendencies are discussed in the appropriate sections of the grammar and in
the commentaries to the Tayap texts (page 289ff).
22        1 The Tayap language and its speakers1.5 Naming practicesEveryone in Gapun has a numŋa nomb ‘village name’, which is one of a closed
class of names that are recycled every third or fourth generation. When the
person who bore the name most recently has died, it becomes available for reuse.
All personal names are the property of one of the five different clans to which
all Gapuners belong – crocodile (orem), dog (nje), parrot (karar), pig (mbor) or
flying fox (njakep). This means that a name expresses clan membership, which
is a crucial and central facet of villagers’ identity, since it regulates access to
land rights (different clans have rights to different areas of land) and marriage
possibilities (clans are exogamous, so one’s spouse should not be a fellow clan
member).
     Because names signify clan membership, a person cannot give a child a
name that belongs to another clan. Such an act would be a kind of theft and
would result, villagers are agreed, in the ensorcellment and death of the child, of
the person who named the child or of a matrilineal relative of those persons (see
Kulick 1992: 98–99 for a fuller discussion).
      A child’s parents have little say in what their child will be called. When a
baby is born and has survived a few days, one of the baby’s relatives (normally
a matrilineal relative such as the baby’s mother’s mother, the mother’s uncle or
one of her siblings) will let it be known that they are going to ‘put a name’ (nomb
ŋgur) on the child. In due course – several weeks to a month after the child’s
birth – the self-appointed bestower of the name will let it be known what the
child will be called. If the mother or father doesn’t like the sound of the name that
the relative has come up with, they can reject it and ask her or him to think of a
better one. Or they can ask another relative to put another name on the child, so
that the child has two competing names.
     This occasionally happens even if both a child’s parents are satisfied with the
name that has given to their new baby: sometimes that name is a taboo name for
one of the parents – it may be the name of a deceased in-law, for example, and the
names of in-laws are forbidden for villagers to call, even after the in-law bearing
the name has died. In a case like that, the parent who is unable to call her or his
child by name will either solicit a second name, or else she or he will address the
child by a nickname, which will often be a word that draws attention to a defect
or disability.
     Villagers do not hide or try to disguise people’s physical or intellectual differ-
ences from others; on the contrary, they continually foreground such differences
with names like Ŋgino (Tayap ‘Eye’; the nickname of a woman with strabismus);
Kela (Tok Pisin ‘Baldy’, the nickname of a child who fell into a fire at a young age
and was left with a large scar, from which hair cannot grow, covering most of his

head); or Sens (Tok Pisin ‘Crazy’, the nickname of a young man who is probably
epileptic and who sometimes blanks out of an interaction for several minutes at a
time).
    Village names are anywhere from one to four syllables, with the majority
consisting of two syllables. Some examples are:
syllables     female name                           male name1             Mbit, Mbop, Mbup                      Kak, Kem, Njab

3             Karepa, Mbasama, Poniker              Oŋenjar, Sakoko, Tagipa
4             Armambɨra, Somasoma, Tamgeria         Ajiragi, Antamawri, KaŋíraseSince the 1950s, each villager also has a Christian name (‘kristen nem’ in Tok
Pisin, no word in Tayap). In contrast to village names, a person’s Christian name
is chosen by his or her parents or by a matrilineal relative whom the parents think
can come up with a better name than they can. They choose a name either that
they have heard someone from another village being called, or that they have
decided is a name from the Bible.
     Following the pattern of their traditional naming practices, villagers avoid
giving their child the same name that somebody else already has, so there is
usually only one Maria, one Joseph, one Paul, etc. in Gapun at any one time.
     A child’s Christian name is thought up whenever the Catholic priest from the
Marienberg mission station comes to the village to baptize children – an event
that occurs about once every two or three years. Villagers who get too creative with
Christian names are chastised and corrected by the priest. In 2009, for example,
one couple had chosen the name ‘Anunciata’ for their three-year-old daughter,
because they liked the sound of the name and they had heard from someone that
it was the name of a nun somewhere. As the priest from Marienberg was about to
anoint the child, the girl’s godparent told him that the child’s Christian name was
to be ‘Anunciata’. The priest stopped the ceremony.
     “That’s not a Christian name”, he announced. The parents would have to
come up with something different.
     The parents were silent.
     Getting no response, the priest asked who the father was. When he was iden-
tified, he asked him impatiently what other names he had considered for the girl.
The father said nothing.
     From somewhere in the back of the church, one of the mother’s relatives sug-
gested ‘Tema’.
24        1 The Tayap language and its speakers     The priest asked the girl’s father if he wanted the name ‘Tema’ (the girl’s
mother’s wishes or opinions – in keeping with Catholic practice – were not solic-
ited or considered).
     The father answered by looking down at his feet and saying softly, “If you
want to change it, that’s alright” (“Sapos yu laik sensim bai mi bihainim yu”).
     “No”, the priest said to him. “Do you want that name?” (“Nogat, yu laikim
despela nem tu?”)
      The father repeated himself, “If you want to change it, that’s alright”.
     “But do you like the name?” the priest wanted to know. (“Na yu laikim tu?”)
     “Yeah”, said the father reluctantly and barely audibly, “Em i orait” (“It’s OK”).
     Thus did little Anunciata become baptized as Tema, a name that the parents
don’t like at all, and that, consequently, has never been uttered by anyone since
that moment of baptism.
     In day-to-day life, most villagers are called by their village names. A handful
of people, however, are usually called by their Christian name, either because
they want to foreground their Catholic piety, or because their parents never really
liked the village names given to their child, so they got around it by always calling
the child by his or her Christian name.
     For official purposes such as school enrollment or electoral rolls, villagers are
identified by their Christian name and the village name of their father. So Ŋgero,
one of my main language informants in 2009, is identified in official contexts as
Prisila Sair.
     This patrilineal naming practice is contrary to and corrosive of how villagers
reckon kinship, which is matrilineally – a villager belongs to the clan of her or
his mother, not her or his father. Increasingly, however, as a direct result both
of Catholic teaching and government sanctioned conventions such as official
naming practices, fathers are asserting rights over their children, and are begin-
ning to “take” their children into their clans with a frequency that far exceeds
past practice.
     Important mythical ancestors, deities and spirits also have names, as do all
the areas of Gapun’s vast rainforest. The more esoteric names for the ancestors
and deities vanished from Tayap in the 1990s with the last of the village’s truly
knowledgeable big men. Those men declined to pass on the names to their matri-
lineal nephews, as used to be happen, because, they told me in the 1980s, the
names were powerful elements in sorcery chants and could be used to kill people.
The big men who made this decision were all strongly Catholic, and they believed
that their traditional knowledge was part of what was preventing Gapuners from
changing into white people (Kulick 1992).
     Tayap words for commonly visited areas of the rainforest remain known
among villagers, because they walk through the forest every day to hunt, gather
                                                       Tayap linguistic profile    25
food and go to their gardens or sago swamps. The names of places rarely visited
by villagers and that are several days’ walk from the village are less well known,
and only the oldest people in the village can recite them, after long consultations
with one another.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"
"Bird namesNames for birds are an important exception to Tayap’s otherwise relatively modest
wildlife vocabulary. The extent of Tayap’s bird vocabulary is surprising. The rain-
forest is full of birds, certainly. But it is also full of other kinds of wildlife, such
as frogs, bats, spiders, and insects that the villagers do not distinguish lexically.
Even large mammals such as the different species of tree possums and cuscus
look very different from one another in terms of size and fur-color, but Tayap clas-
sifies them all with the same word, enamb.
     Birds (tam) do not make up any particularly noticeable percentage of the
villagers’ diet. Boys kill small birds with slingshots or arrows and roast them
to eat as snacks. During the dry season, young men set traps or build blinds
(pura) in which they hide at dawn and dusk, hoping to shoot large birds like the
turkey-sized crowned pigeon (momɨk) when those fly down to drink at the few
streams and ponds that retain water. Villagers eat cassowary (ŋgat) meat with
gusto, but those big birds are elusive and fierce, and they were killed only rarely
until about 2012, when one village man learned to set rope traps for cassowaries
                                               Animals, insects, fish and birds     445
and has subsequently killed scores of the birds – so many, in fact, that they are
now becoming increasingly rare throughout the area.
      Cassowary eggs are boiled and eaten whenever they are found, and women
and girls regularly dig into the mounds made by scrubfowls (kokosuar) and
brush-turkeys (onaw), searching for their large red eggs (yamiŋe), which are
prized as a delicacy, regardless of what stage of development the egg happens
to be in when it is eaten. Some villagers raise a few domestic chickens (kokok),
but those leathery fowl are only killed on special occasions to impress and honor
visitors, or as part of a conciliatory or funerary feast.
      With a few exceptions (cassowaries, eagles and a few small birds), birds do
not feature in the village’s myths and traditional stories. Nor is the plumage of
birds collected, at least nowadays, to make into decorations to wear on festive
occasions.
      Despite their relative lack of importance in the villagers’ diet, myths or daily
life, many birds have names in Tayap. I collected more than 70 words for different
bird species. I was able to do this thanks to the marvelous book, Birds of New
Guinea, by Bruce M. Beehler, Thane K. Pratt and Dale A. Zimmerman, illustrated
by Dale A. Zimmerman and James Coe (Princeton University Press, 1986). This
invaluable field guide contains 55 illustrated plates, most in color, depicting
every species of bird known to exist in New Guinea.
      Villagers of all ages loved this book. I had others that I used to help me elicit
words for animals, such as Mammals of New Guinea by Tim Flannery (Cornell
University Press, 1995). Those books, though, had photographs of animals, rather
than drawings. Villagers turned out to be much less interested in the photo-
graphs than they were in drawings. My impression was that villagers had a hard
time recognizing many animals from their photographs. Many of the photos in
a book like Mammals of New Guinea, it must be said, are not particularly clear.
They are taken from angles, or from distances – for example, in extreme close
up – from which villagers would normally not ever view the animals. There were
also numerous photographs of animals like small bats that villagers call by the
same word, and have little interest in differentiating. Villagers quickly became
bored looking at this book.
      The plates in Birds of New Guinea elicited a completely different response.
Older men and women repeatedly returned to the drawings to recognize and
name different kinds of birds. Younger people and children used the drawings to
test each others’ knowledge of bird names.
      The following is a list of all the names of birds I was able to elicit from villag-
ers. The English names are from Birds of New Guinea, and for easy identification,
the relevant plate number and drawing number in that book is given in parenthe-
ses after the English translation (anyone wishing to know the classificatory Latin
446           Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionaryname of the birds will find it there). If no drawing number is given, the Tayap
word refers to all birds depicted on that plate.
     The overwhelming majority of the birds with names in Tayap have no names
in Tok Pisin, which means that the most convenient way to talk about them is to
use a vernacular language name. Villagers under thirty, especially females, who
do not hunt birds like boys and young men do, generally do not know the names
of birds that are rarely encountered. But for commonly seen birds, the vernacular
names are still known, even by children. Because there are no Tok Pisin equiva-
lents, many of the words for birds are likely to endure long after many other parts
of the language have been forgotten.

       ‘Tell Mawi not to go’7.1.5 Expressing a desire for someone else to do somethingThe final use of the subjunctive in Tayap is in constructions in which a speaker
expresses a desire that some action be performed by someone else or something
else. Here the subjunctive occurs in the “desire” clause, after an expression of
cognition in the main clause. It is the appearance of the verb in its subjunctive
form that generates the meaning of the verb in the main clause as one of desire,
rather than cognition.(7-19) a. ŋa numbwan pikun ŋɨ onet Merewre

212        7 MoodThis construction using an expression of cognition in the main clause and a sub-
junctive in the subordinate clause is unusual – examples (7-19a) and (7-19b) are
from elicitation sessions with senior men in the 1980s. I have not encountered
this construction in any of the conversations or speeches that I have transcribed.
Instead, desire predicates are constructed in one of two ways, none of them
involving the subjunctive.
     The first way of forming a desire predicate is with the verb phrase ‘arei + erga-
tive + tar’, which literally means ‘desire takes’. This is a moribund construction:
like examples (7-19a-b) above, my only recorded instances of it are in elicitation
sessions in the 1980s with senior informants.
     The construction is realized without overt marking on the main clause, and
the verb in the subordinate clause is inflected for future tense:(7-20) ŋɨ areiyi tatɨŋgɨn ŋa okɨnet Potowre
       ŋɨ       arei     =yi        ta     -tɨ   -ŋgɨ        -n

       1sg go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.r Wongan =all
       ‘he wants me to go to Wongan’ (lit. ‘desire takes him, I will go to Wongan’)The most common way to express the desire that someone or something else do
something that you want is to use the verb nam, which has the primary meaning
of ‘talk’ or ‘tell’, but which is also used to mean ‘think’ (this kind of semantic
conflation between verbs like “talk”, “tell”, “think” and “desire” is common in
Papuan languages; Reesink 1993).
     Desire predicates with nam are constructed the same way as the example
above, that is to say with the verb in the subordinate clause inflected in the future
tense. Speakers also often use the adverb nande ‘thusly’ to draw attention to the
verb of desire, producing sentences like the following:(7-21) ŋa nande namnet yu okɨtet Ombágire
       ŋa nande nam -net                   yu o    -kɨ  -tet

7.2 Prohibitive (proh)In contrast to the imperative mood, which expresses the speaker’s command for
the addressee to perform a particular action, the prohibitive is a command to not
perform an action. It can be translated as ‘Don’t do X’, ‘Don’t dare do X’ or ‘X is
prohibited’. The prohibitive cannot be negated. It is formed as follows:    person
    ŋa ‘I’
    yu ‘you’
                                  irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgarke
    ŋgu ‘she’
    ŋɨ ‘he’

    ŋgɨ ‘they’       →            irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgroke
    dl               →            irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgrekeIf a speaker includes the benefactive object in this construction, the action is
marked as ongoing, in the progressive aspect, so it means ‘Don’t be doing X!’(7-22) a. emarar -ŋgarke!

           ‘you can’t be here!’7.3 Admonitive (adm)A structure that is morphologically almost identical to the prohibitive occurs in
the modal construction that expresses the non-desirability of an action.
     This modality in Tayap has its exact equivalent in the Tok Pisin expression
“nogut X”, where X denotes an action that the speaker doesn’t want to happen,
regrets happening, is uncertain has happened or will happen, or when the speaker
anticipates or senses that something undesirable will ensue from the action’s
occurrence. This is a difficult expression to translate, because it can be a warning,
as in ‘X better not happen/have happened’; a negative hope, as in ‘I hope X doesn’t
happen’ (or, ‘I hoped X wouldn’t happen’); a concern, as in ‘May X not happen’; or
a meditation, like ‘What if X should happen?’. The admonitive cannot be negated.
     In Tayap, this construction differs from the prohibitive only in that the final
-ke of the prohibitive markers is -ana in the admonitive, and that there is no ben-
efactive in it:      person
      ŋa ‘I’
      yu ‘you’
                                 irr verb root + -ŋgarana

      yim ‘we’
      yum ‘you pl’      →        irr verb root + -ŋgremana
      ŋgɨ ‘they’        →        irr verb root + -ŋgroana

          who is talking                 better not talk’; said to someone who
                                         knows a secret about another person
                                         and is going to visit that person; the
                                         speaker is expressing the hope that
                                         the person addressed won’t open his
                                         or her mouth and spill the beans7.4 Intentional (intent)The intentional mood expresses two kinds of events. The first is actions that are
or were intended or desired but that have not been completed or that didn’t occur
or won’t occur. The second kind of event expressed by the intentional mood is an
inevitable action: an action that often, in retrospect, ended in a foreseeable way.
    An example of this latter sense is the response of a woman seeing a photograph I
had taken of a gravely ill Monei Mbanaŋ; he had been sick for weeks and I photographed
him as he was about to be carried to a canoe and taken to a hospital, where he died a
few days later. Upon seeing this photograph months after Monei had died, looking at
a desiccated and paralyzed Monei, this woman murmured waso-kɨ-nana (die.irr-irr-
intent) ‘he’s about to/intending to die’, in a soft, rising voice expressing sorrow.
    The intentional mood was mentioned earlier in the section on the near future
tense (5.4.2.3) because it is constructed in a similar way, with the bound morpheme
216        7 Mood-ana (-nana after a vowel; this form is often reduced and realized as -na) affixed
directly to the irrealis object marker (for transitive verbs) or directly to the irrealis
marker -ki-, -kɨ- or -ku- (for intransitive verbs). So the structure is as follows:transitive verbs       irr verb stem + irr object + -(n)anaintransitive verbs     irr verb stem + irr morpheme + -(n)anaExamples of the intentional mood are:(7-25) a. ewar ŋa sokoi akrunana, sokoi wákare

of’, as in the following, consisting of two juxtaposed main clauses:

another verb of the sentence (7-27), or by a word like mɨnda ‘tired of’, ‘sick of’ that
expresses negative affect (7-28):(7-27)   a. ŋa aiki wákare ŋɨ rarŋgrɨnana

to the irrealis modal suffix that follows the verb stem.
     With transitive verbs, the irrealis subject suffix (Section 5.2.2) is added after
the irrealis object suffix.
     So future is formed in Tayap according to the following patterns:
 intransitive
                   irr verb stem + irr suffixes -ki, -kɨ or -ku + irr subject
 verbs transitive
                   irr verb stem + irr object + irr subject

The future encodes an unreal event, but also locates an event in time. It con-
trasts with the near future in terms of the action’s expected occurrence in rela-
tion to the moment of speaking: the near future is expected to occur soon in
relation to the moment of speaking; the future is expected to occur at some
other point in the future – a time that may or may not be specified by a temporal
adverb like ‘this evening’, ‘tomorrow’ or ‘later’.","[171, 172, 173]"

CommentaryThe narrator of this story is an example of a young passive active speaker, a villager
who never speaks more than a few formulaic phases of Tayap. She speaks Tok Pisin
to everyone: her children, her husband, her old mother, her siblings, and even her
mother-in-law, with whom she interacts every day, and who is a Tayap-dominant
woman in her late fifties. Despite the fact that this young woman never speaks
Tayap, she not only possesses solid grammatical competence in the language; she
is also able to activate that competence to produce narratives of relatively great
complexity. She is the youngest villager able to do this; her husband, who is 6 years
older, was able to produce a coherent narrative only with her active intervention.
     Gapuners would judge this narrative to be a good story in terms of structure,
content and performance. It adheres to the village narrative convention of having
the protagonist or protagonists go off into the rainforest, have something happen
                                       Tayap Text 4: Young men kill a cassowary     317
there, and then return, at the end of the story, back to the village. It contains
detail and a variety of perspectives. It is dramatic.
       Grammatically, the narrative is complex. It contains a number of different
verbs of motion besides ‘go’ and ‘come’ (lines 4–5, 16, 21, 22, 36), serial verbs (lines
13, 15, 23, 36) and clauses coordinated with the clause subordinating morpheme
-re (lines 26, 51). All verbs but one are correctly inflected for subject – this speaker
makes none of the errors that most other young speakers make, discussed
throughout the grammar. The one inflectional error she does make is tuptukro
‘they went first’ in line 7; but she corrects herself and produces the correct form a
few words later. Her pronunciation of the word, /tuptuko/, deviates a bit from the
more usual tɨptuko, but it is within the range of acceptable variation.
     The only grammatical mistakes made by the speaker both occur with regard to
the gender of the snake. For most of the narrative, the snake is correctly gendered
masculine. But three times, in lines 29, 33, and 42, it becomes feminine (even if line
29 is ambiguous, because it isn’t entirely clear what the speaker is referring to).","[336, 337]"

Appendix 1English translation of Georg Höltker 1938. Eine fragmentarische Wörterliste
der Gapún-Sprache Newguineas. Anthropos 33: 279–82
                               Translated by Agnes Brandt, edited by D. Kulickeditor’s note:
In his transcriptions of Tayap words, Höltker used “the Anthropos alphabet”,
which was a catalogue of phonetic symbols employed by German missionaries
and anthropologists at the time Höltker was writing. This alphabet is handily
summarized in an article by Kirschbaum and von Führer-Haimendorf (1934:
I-IV).1 The symbols have not been used for over 40 years, but with the exception
of one symbol – a̤̣, which denotes what the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

2 Semantic error: the verb nam- ‘tell’ is incorrect here; the speaker wants kotar-(p)-e- ‘ask’.
   Grammatical errors: the speaker omits the ergative clitic on the subject of the verb, and also
omits a locative case marker on Yengia, the undergoer of the verb. The grammatically correct way
of phrasing the question is:      ŋayar=ke yu=yi            morasi apro Yengia=nɨ    ni-tu-ku-n?

4.4 Peripheral casesTayap has five peripheral cases. Three of the cases mark animate and inanimate
referents differently.
     The possessive case marks possession, association and part-whole rela-
tionships, with no distinction between alienable and inalienable possession.
Possession is discussed in Section 4.5.
     The locative case has the widest semantic scope of Tayap’s peripheral cases. It
specifies location in time and space, covering relationships that in other languages
are expressed in allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal and durative cases.
     The ablative case expresses movement away from a person, place or object,
or an action of revelation in which something that was hidden becomes visible.
     The perlative case expresses movement along, through or by means of.
     The dative case is used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison and a number
of other relations.
     All these peripheral case markers are clitics, as they occur attached to the last
element of an NP with scope over the whole NP: see for example (4-40i), (4-40j),
(4-42b), (4-43d), (4-43i), among others. Many of them contain optional material
(shown in parentheses), the conditioning factors of which are not known.
Examples (the relevant peripheral case clitics are in bold):

130        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession4.5 PossessionPossession is marked by a possessive clitic on the possessor. Possessor clitics
mark higher animate singular (=ma), higher animate plural (=mandama) and
inanimate (=ŋa) possessors. Note also that Tayap has external possession con-
structions, discussed in Section 7.5 in the section on benefactives.
     This clitic is also used to form relative clauses (Section 9.5), finite nominaliza-
tions (Section 9.6) and perception clauses (Section 9.7).
     Example (4-44) shows the possessive clitic marking an NP consisting of a
modified noun ‘cold belly’, thus demonstrating the clitic rather than affix status
of these forms:animate plural inalienable:(4-44)   imin pokemŋan munjema tɨk
         imin pokem =ŋan        munje          =ma       tɨk
         belly cold      =poss man             =poss     story
         ‘the calm man’s story’For the purposes of possession, animals and humans are considered higher ani-
mates, and plants are considered inanimate. Possessive relations expressed with
this construction include alienable, inalienable, body part, association and part-
whole possession. There is no morpho-syntactic distinction between these cate-
gories (but see Section 7.5 for the role of benefactive object suffixes in body part
possession).
     Some examples:animate singular body part (human):(4-45)   Mbanaŋma tokɨmot
         Mbanaŋ =ma              tokɨmot
         Mbanaŋ =poss            chest
         ‘Mbanaŋ’s chest’animate singular body part (animal):(4-46)   aramma sik
         aram =ma        sik
         snake =poss mouth
         ‘the snake’s mouth’

         nuwomb =ŋa            taw
         stream      =poss side
         ‘the side of the stream’Recursive possession also occurs, using the possessive clitic on each possessor,
with the possessee unmarked (see also example 4-44):(4-51)   Samekma rorma mbor suman
         Samek =ma         ror     =ma mbor      suman
         Samek =poss child =poss pig             big
         ‘Samek’s child’s big pig’The animate possessive clitic can be used on an inanimate noun to highlight that
the noun has some kind of relation to humans:

            ‘pig used as payment for an area of forest’It is possible that this variation represents the remnants of an earlier classifica-
tion system, but this is all that remains of it now.4.5.1 =ŋa(n) poss with adjectivesThe possessive clitic =ŋa(n) can also occur in construction with adjectives (see
Section 3.3 for more on adjectives). However in these cases the function is clearly
not possession but rather modification. For example:(4-54)   iminkato sawirŋa
         iminkato         sawir       =ŋa
         lower_intestine black        =poss

         ‘big thief’
4.5.2 Possessive modificationThe possessive clitic can also occur, similarly to the above examples, but on
nouns or verbs as well as adjectives, to create modifiers: for example, in (4-57)–
(4-58) it occurs on a noun, rendering it a modifier, and in (4-59)–(4-61) it occurs on
an adjective which here modifies a verb:(4-57)   kandawŋa munje
         kandaw     =ŋa         munje
         sickness =poss         man

         ground     =poss    woman
         ‘ground woman’ (an insult: it means ‘you’re so old you have been
         around since when the ground emerged’)(4-59)   ei sumanŋa ror
         ei    suman =ŋa           ror

         ‘bad, sore-ridden, smelly man’In (4-59) the verb ei ‘cry’ is modified by ‘big’, the phrase in its turn modifying the
noun ‘child’. Example (4-60) has the same structure: the verb is followed by the
possessive-marked adjective, together modifying ‘woman’. Example (4-61) is more
complex. Here we have a head noun munje ‘man’, modified by adjective ‘bad’ and

1 The =re appears as =dre after n.
116       4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionFor those reasons, ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn can potentially be understood to mean either
‘he speared the cassowary (with a spear)’ or ‘the cassowary struck him’ (that is,
pierced his body with the knife-like claws on its feet).
    Using the ergative case marker resolves ambiguity by marking the transitive
subject who performs the action. So compare:(4-30) a. ŋɨŋi ŋgat poŋgɨn
          ŋɨ=ŋi            ŋgat      po -ŋgɨ                         -n
          3sg.m=erg.m cassowary shoot.r -3sg.m.r.o                   -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘he speared the cassowary’       b. ŋgatŋi ŋɨ poŋgɨn
          ŋgat=ŋi            ŋɨ      po         -ŋgɨ   -n
          cassowary=erg.m 3sg.m shoot.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘the cassowary speared him’ (with its claws)Note that it is not the case that when two NPs (A and O) are present the ergative
marking must be used. The following example contains a verb that is highly tran-
sitive with two NP arguments present but there is no ergative:(4-31) ŋgɨ ŋgomar tarmbrar ŋgwok
       ŋgɨ ŋgomar tar            -mb       -rar ŋgwok
       3pl fish       take.irr -3pl.r.o -ml go.3pl.r
       ‘They picked up fish as they walked’However there are also many examples in which there can be no ambiguity, and
yet an ergative marker is used:(4-32) mbumjorŋi minjikankɨ nda kokɨr kukupemiet
       mbumjor=ŋi              minjikan -kɨ                nda     kokɨr
       Mbumjor_snake=erg.m nearby         -intens          dm      head       ku      -ku         pemiet
       bring -3sg.f.r.o rise_up.sg.m.r
       ‘the snake raised his head really close’One verb that virtually always marks its subject with the ergative clitic is kiraw-
when it conveys the meaning of ‘know’ (this verb also has a range of other
meanings, including ‘consider something’, ‘recognize something’ and ‘taste
something’); note that this example has the unusual structure of a preposed
head, with possessive phrase following.
                                                    The ergative case (erg)       117
(4-33) orak orak aŋgo sumbwaŋaŋi ŋɨ kirawtɨŋgɨn ainde
       orak orak aŋgo sumbwa =ŋa              =ŋi     ŋɨ
       thing thing dx.f ground =poss =erg.m 3sg.m       kiraw     -tɨ -ŋgɨ            -n            ainde
       know.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s dx.m
       ‘this thing of the ground knows about him.’Perception verbs may or may not have subjects carrying the ergative marker.
Compare the following: (4-34a), which marks the subject with the ergative clitic,
and (4-34b), which doesn’t:(4-34) a. yim noni tarkru wákareŋan noni tankun
          yim non       =i        tar        -kru             wákare      =ŋan
          1pl indef =erg.f hear.irr -3sg.f.irr.o              neg         =poss           non    =i        ta        -n -ku          -n
           indef =erg.f hear.r -s <3sg.f.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘Some of us didn’t hear it, some did hear it.’       b. Akupi ŋgume ŋɨ tankun aŋgude
          Akupi ŋgu     -me ŋɨ
          Akupi 3sg.f -dx 3sg.m           ta     -n -ku              -n           aŋgude
           see.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s dx.f
           ‘He saw Akupi [’s spirit]’4.3.1.1 Ergative clitics on intransitive verbs
The main function of ergative clitics is to mark the subject of a transitive verb.
In Tayap, however, the ergative marker can also be attached to the subject of an
intransitive verb.
     This marked use often carries a particular nuance, which can be illustrated
by an example taken from a narrative about a powerful crocodile water-spirit
named Ŋgayam. In telling this story, the narrator uses the ergative with an intran-
sitive verb:(4-35) Ŋgayamŋi mbet
       Ŋgayam =ŋi    mbet
       Ŋgayam =erg.m come.3sg.m.r
       ‘Ŋgayam came’
118       4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThe ergative here carries the connotation of purposefulness. The implication
is that Ŋgayam didn’t just come – he came with a purpose, to do something, to
perform some kind of action. And indeed he did: the story tells of how Ŋgayam
flooded the rainforest and drowned an entire kin group as they stood gathering
his children – who had the form of fish – in his jungle streams. A version of this
story appears at the end of this grammar as Tayap Text 2.
     Another telling instance of an ergative marker on an intransitive verb
occurred once when men from the neighboring village of Sanae arrived in
Gapun unannounced a few days after one of their relatives had been attacked
by a Gapuner. Everyone in Gapun was fearful of the Sanae men, because it was
assumed that they had come to fatally bewitch the attacker or one of his matri-
lineal relatives. As the Sanae men arrived in Gapun, villagers whispered to one
another:(4-36) Merewŋgrogi ŋgwek
       Merew -ŋgro =gi           ŋgwek
       Sanae -pl       =erg.pl come.3pl.r
       ‘the Sanae [men] are coming’The use of the ergative in this case meant that the Sanae men were not just drop-
ping by Gapun on an innocent visit to socialize. They were coming to accomplish
a particular sinister purpose.
    This use of the ergative to mark intentionality on intransitive verbs is also
apparent in cases where the ergative is used to denote a remarked-upon lack of
intentionality. The following example was uttered by a woman screaming abuse
at her relatives because her nephew littered the ground in front of her house with
seeds he blew from a homemade pea-shooter (i.e. in front of the house of the
woman having the “kros”, see Kulick 1992: 104–113 and Kulick 1993 for details on
these kinds of antagonistic speech events):(4-37) yumŋni mburaiakaku wákare!
       yum =ŋi          mburai     -ak           aku       wákare
       2pl =erg.m sweep.irr -link                be.irr    neg
       ‘you all never sweep!’Here the ergative clitic on an intransitive verb (mburai ‘sweep’) inflected in the
negative habitual aspect (see Section 8.3.2) highlights the consistent lack of
intention on the part of her addressees to perform an act that she thinks they
ought to consider doing occasionally.
                                                     The ergative case (erg)    119
    Suter’s (2010) description of optional ergativity in the Trans New Guinea
language Kâte shows that the ergative marker is most likely to be used in
clauses with the marked word order of OSV (as opposed to the usual SOV) or
when a focus particle is used on the subject (Suter 2010: 435). In other Trans
New Guinea languages, factors include animacy, agency and control (Suter
2010: 436).
    As we have seen, however, there seems to be no single factor or group of
factors which account for the use or absence of the ergative marker in Tayap.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"

the University of Chicago, for granting me the research leave that allowed me
to return to Gapun and conduct fieldwork for nine months during 2009, and for
leave to visit Gapun for several months in 2010, 2012 and 2014. I am grateful to my
current employer, Uppsala University, for leave to travel to the town of Madang in
order to complete the final draft of this book in spring 2018.
     In Papua New Guinea, I thank James Robins and Georgia Kaipu, of Papua
New Guinea’s National Research Institute, for their impressive skill in negotiat-
ing the bureaucracy involved in obtaining a research visa. I owe a large debt to
Divine Word University in the town of Madang, which generously provided me
with a place to live while I worked on the final version of this text. The late Nancy
Sullivan, whose feisty and festive presence in Madang was instrumental in luring
me back to Papua New Guinea after an absence of fifteen years, is deeply, sorely
missed. Other people in Madang whose company and support I value are John

     I am grateful to several colleagues who generously provided me with
support over the years. Many years ago, Christopher Stroud worked with me to
make initial sense of Tayap, and I gratefully acknowledge his contributions to
my understanding of the language. Eva Lindström shared much appreciated
pre-fieldwork technical advice about audio recorders, Toughbook computers and
solar panels. Two stays at ANU in Australia, one of them as a visiting fellow at
ANU’s Humanities Research Centre, facilitated by Nick Evans and Alan Rumsey,
were extremely important in the development of this text. Andy Pawley gave me
very helpful advice in relation to the dictionary, which he read through with care.
Nick Evans provided important encouragement and perspicacious suggestions
about the analysis at several crucial points when I felt stuck.
     I am grateful to Bill Foley for reading the entire first draft of the grammar and
providing invaluable feedback.
     I want to take this opportunity to explicitly acknowledge the work of my
co-author, Angela Terrill. Upon receiving the reader’s report from an anony-

VIII      Acknowledgementsto help me transform the grammar into publishable form. In 2017, I contacted
Angela, who through sheer serendipity happened to be living in Uppsala, the city
in Sweden where I am employed. Angela accepted my invitation to work with
my manuscript, and remarkably, she managed to acquire a feel for Tayap – its
idiosyncrasies and its genius – after only a few months. Angela’s incisive inter-
ventions, her continual exhortations that “we need more examples”, her exten-
sive knowledge of Papuan linguistics, and her clear head and good cheer are the
reason why this grammar and dictionary is now finally seeing the light of day.
     My greatest debt, obviously, is to the people of Gapun, whom I have known
now for over three decades. Villagers have always seen to it that I have had a
house to live in (three times, in 1987, 1991 and 2009, they have built me a house),
and food to eat. My debt to them is a collective one, and this documentation of
their vernacular language is one way I hope they will sense some repayment of
that debt. Many of the people who worked with me on the intricacies of the Tayap
language are no longer alive, among them my chief language informants in the
1980s, Raya Ayarpa, Kruni Ayarpa and Mukar Raya. In 2009, I worked most inten-
sively on the language with Monei Mbanaŋ, Samek Wanjo and Ŋgero Sair, all of
whom were remarkable teachers. Others to whom I am especially grateful for my
stay in Gapun in 2009 are Mbaso Monei who allowed me to live in a room in his
house when I arrived in Gapun, and his older brother, the village komiti at the
time, Opɨ Monei who organized, cajoled and supervised much of the labor that
eventually built my house.
     My greatest single debt during my months in Gapun since I began returning
in 2006 after a fifteen-year absence is to those two men’s younger sister, Ndamor
Monei her husband Mbanu Ajiragi and the couple’s seven sassy children Mbobot,
Mopok, Poniker, Ŋawr, Ŋgayam, Kape and Kaŋirase. The house that villagers built
me in 2009 was in the center of Gapun, right next to Ndamor’s house. Without
anyone ever asking her to do so, Ndamor quietly took it upon herself to make sure
that I was always fed, and she and her daughters kept the area surrounding my
house clean and free from dog feces and pig droppings. Ndamor has one of the
most raucous senses of humor in the village, and now in her mid-forties, she is
also one of the few women in Gapun who still has ferocious and poetic kros-es
(harangues of anger) in Tayap. I loved both her humor and her anger – some of
the most imaginative obscenities quoted in this book are Ndamor’s. Living right
next to Ndamor, in full hearing of everything that went on in her house at all
hours of the day and night, was continually enlightening and hugely entertain-
ing. Whenever I feel nostalgic for Gapun, it is my time spent listening to Ndamor
and talking and laughing with her and her family that I miss the most.
     I am grateful to the librarians in Kungliga Biblioteket in Stockholm, who pro-
vided me with a forskarplats in the reading room, where I was able to sit and

Words pertaining to sago processingSago is the staple food of Gapun. It is eaten every single day of the year, ideally at
least twice a day; once in the morning and once in the late afternoon. Its raw form
is a flour that resembles compacted corn starch. This flour (muna) can be made
into a kind of rubbery pancake (tamwai) by heating it on a broken pot shard
(pambram) or a frying pan, it can be tossed onto the fire raw in a tennis ball-
sized chunk (muna kokɨr, which literally means ‘sago head’), it can be wrapped
in a leaf and cooked in on a fire (paŋgɨp), or it can be crumbled into a bamboo
tube and thrown onto a fire to congeal (munakumund). Its most common and
most appreciated form, though, is as what, in English, is usually misleadingly
called ‘sago pudding’ or ‘sago jelly’. Both designations are misleading because
they imply (a) that said food item that has the consistency of pudding or jelly, and
(b) that said food item is appetizing.
     Both these implications are false. In fact, the texture of sago referred to by
‘sago jelly’ is much closer to slime or phlegm than it is to jelly or pudding. Its
consistency is such that some of a mouthful will be in your mouth; at the same
time some of it will be hanging down into your throat, like a long thick sputum.
And appetizing, alas, ‘sago jelly’ is not – unless, of course, one happens to be a
Sepik villager raised on it from birth (villagers in Gapun start feeding their babies
sago jelly only a few days after they are born). The color of ‘sago jelly’ varies from
light pink to dark red or even black, depending on the quality and character of the
water in which it was leached.
     ‘Sago jelly’ (mum) is served in plates or washbasins in big viscous globs. On
top of such a glob, women will place a few leaves of some vegetable, or a small
piece of fish or tiny chunk of meat – like a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae
450        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionary(although, again, that image is deceptive because it suggests something tasty).
On top of that, a few spoonfuls of ‘soup’ (wawan) will be poured. ‘Soup’ consists
of coconut milk (i.e. the liquid produced when a coconut is grated and squeezed
in cold water) in which the vegetables or meat served on top of the mum has
been boiled. If the villagers have salt, they will use copious amounts of it to flavor
the soup. Aside from salt, no flavorings, spices or herbs of any kind are used in
Gapun’s cuisine.
     Villagers produce sago in a process so complicated that it makes one wonder
how human beings could possibly ever have discovered it. Most sago palms, to
begin with, are far from inviting: they have have long sharp needles covering
their trunks and their leaves. Nevertheless, people somehow, at some point in the
distant past, discovered that an edible starch can be wrested from the inner bark
of those spine-covered palms, according to the following steps.
     First, men fell the sago palm and use bush knives to strip it of its needles. The
outer bark of the palm is then slit open with an axe, lengthwise down the palm.
This outer bark is pried open on both sides of the cut with axes and bush knives,
producing a gash which men widen until the outer bark lies open like a shell. Men
then begin chipping away at the exposed pale inner bark with an instrument that
looks like a cross between an axe and a large chisel (makor or yasuk). They start
at the base of the tree (wot) and work their way upwards towards the crown of the
palm (mar). The scraped-away inner bark looks like coarse pink sawdust.
     This sawdust (tawar) is taken away by women to a place from which they can
draw water – ususally a rough well dug somewhere near the sago palm (because
sago palms grow in swamps, there is usually plenty of water on hand). Women
take the sawdust and put handfuls of it into a long funnel (iko or ndadum) that
they make out of the base of one of the sago palm leaves. They attach a coconut
fiber strainer (waris) to the end of this funnel and they pour water into it. They
then squeeze and knead the sago pith in the funnel, thereby releasing the flour
it contains. The flour runs through the strainer along with the water, and is col-
lected in buckets made of palm fronds (kondew) placed on the ground below
the funnel. The sago pith, once it has been leached of its flour in this manner, is
tossed away. Each handful of sago pith is washed 4–5 times to ensure that it has
been completely leached.
     The sago flour that has run through the strainer with the water settles on
the bottom of the palm frond buckets and the water rises to the top. When this
settling process is completed, the water that has risen to the top of the sago is
poured off, and what remains are firm cakes of wet flour. These are dried by cov-
ering them with leaves and putting hot ashes on top. The heat generated by these
ashes extracts the remaining water. The cakes of sago flour (munakatar) are then
carried to the village and used to prepare the villagers’ meals.
                                          Words pertaining to sago processing     451
     ‘Sago jelly’ is made from this raw sago by breaking off a mound of sago flour,
putting it in a pot and diluting it in a small amount of cold water. This produces
a watery paste that is strained so that most of the remaining impurities (insects,
twigs, ashes) are removed. Next, the cook pours a large amount of boiling water
onto the paste, stirring vigorously all the while. The boiling water and the stirring
cause the sago paste to coagulate and become the viscous mass so beloved by
villagers. This pot of gummy mucous is twisted like taffy onto people’s basins, it
is topped with the requisite few leaves or small chunk of meat and fish, and voilà,
Bon Appetit.
     The sago-processing work described above is protypically done by a married
couple. In practice, both men and women can and do perform all steps in the
process by themselves or with same-sex friends or same-sex kin. This might
happen, for example, if a mother sends her teenage girls or boys off to work sago,
or if a person’s spouse is ill and the household supply of sago has run out. But
despite the fact that sago processing can be done alone or in same-sex groups, it
is strongly associated with conjugal couples. In Gapun, there is no ceremony sur-
rounding marriage – nothing is exchanged, bought or given by anyone involved
in a marriage. The only surefire sign that a couple is married is that they go off
together to work sago. This time in the rainforest producing sago is also the time
when a married couple often have sex. In their house, a husband and wife are
seldom alone – and if they have children they are never alone. And what goes on
in the house is audible to anyone walking by, as well as visible to anyone stop-
ping to peek through the braided bamboo or sago palm leaves that villagers use
as walls.
     The entire sago-production process, from felling the sago palm to producing
the cakes of sago flour, takes an entire day, from about 8 am to 3 or 4 o’clock in
the afternoon, for two people to complete. And this day’s work will usually only
result in half the sago palm being processed – the other half remains for the fol-
lowing day. One day’s work produces between 5–8 large cakes of sago. Depending
on how much of that sago one distributes to relatives, this amount of sago will
last a family of eight 2–4 days.
     Traditionally, Gapuners processed sago like their Adjora-speaking neighbors
to the east. Men pulverized sago pith in a seated position, sitting on small benches
made of branches (kokɨparaŋ) and using a short sago-pounder made of a single
piece of wood (yasuk). Women leached sago in a basket (saiput) that they hung
from a frame and squeezed with both hands. In the mid-1960s, Gapuners moved
their village from its former site on top of a small mountain down to its present site
in a swampy clearing in the rainforest. At the same time, they began to adopt the
sago-processing methods used by the villagers of Wongan and other people who
452          Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionarylive near the coast. Women abandoned the sago-leaching basket and men started
to stand up to pound the pith. This method of sago processing has remained the
one used by all villagers. The only innovation since the 1960s occurred in the
1990s, when villagers began to abandon the sago frond buckets into which the
water containing the sago flour settled after the pith had been washed. Again
copying the villagers of Wongan, Gapuners began to carve large canoe-shaped
receptacles and using those instead of the sago-frond buckets. They did this
because the wooden canoes are more durable than the buckets, which fall apart
after only a few weeks’ use.","[469, 470, 471, 472]"

"5.5 ReduplicationThe reduplication of verbs is another way of expressing temporality and epis-
temic stance (usually disapproval). The repetition or iteration of an action, for
example, is expressed by repeating the verb stem:(5-21) a.    ketukketukkwankut

          ‘My trousers keep falling downReduplication of a verb can also carry the meaning that the action expressed by
the verb happens over a length of time.(5-22) a. yu weteta wetukwar wetukwar kukuwe tumbekenɨ

           (hollered by a woman in anger about a man she said always
           cheated her. The meaning is something like ‘come and jerk yourself
           off all the way up the mountain’)
160       5 Basic verb morphology5.5.1 Repeated action
There are a number of ways of showing an action is repeated. The following
example shows repetition, rather than reduplication strictly speaking, of a verb:       b. ŋgɨ amkwar ŋgwoka ŋgwoka ŋayi ŋgɨ orepemɨn
          ŋgɨ am     -kwar ŋgwok      -a      ŋgwok           -a
          3pl fight -mann go.3pl.r -and go.3pl.r              -and           ŋa =yi         ŋgɨ orepe       -mɨ       -n
           1sg =erg.f 3pl leave.r -3pl.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘they were fighting for a long time and I (gender
           unspecified) left them ’In addition to simply repeating a verb to convey that an action or event occurred
several times or extended over a period of time, Tayap has a verbal suffix (-ítŋo)
that marks an action or event as occurring repeatedly and exaggeratedly over
a continuous, extended period of time. The meaning of this form corresponds
to the durative “igo” construction in Tok Pisin – e.g. “em i krai igo igo igo”; ‘he
cried and cried and cried’. The suffix only occurs on intransitive verbs and this
restricted usage may have limited the form’s transmission.
     Speakers under forty understand the meaning of verbs that have the -ítŋo
suffix, but they never produce the forms themselves. In 2009, even speakers over
fifty had trouble thinking of examples. Perhaps the forms occurred mainly in
ritual narrative and singing or tuneful weeping over corpses – verbal skills that
for the most part have become moribund in Gapun.
     In the 1980s, I recorded the suffix -ítŋo for verbs that were repeated over an
extended period of time, for example in the following verbs:           emrar-ítŋo       poror-ítŋo
           play.irr-xd      sing.irr-xd           ketuk-ítŋo       simber-ítŋo
           cough.irr-xd     chew_betel_nut.irr-xd           warak-ítŋo
           talk.irr-xd
I was also told that an alternative form that meant the same thing was the irrealis
verb stem + -ít- + ŋayar, which is an adverb meaning ‘really’. Senior men told me
that both forms below express the same meaning – perhaps because the first form
may be a contraction of the second:
                                                             Reduplication       161
           emrar-ítŋo or emrar-it             ŋayar
           play.irr-xd   play.irr-xd?         reallyThe -ítŋo suffix that I recorded in the 1980s no longer occurs in the speech of
anyone in Gapun.
     Today, to the very limited extent that the idea of repeated actions over an
extended period is encoded by a verbal suffix at all, this is done by adding the
suffix -ŋo, or its variants -eŋo, -erŋo and -irŋo directly to the irrealis stem of an
intransitive verb. The suffix is the same for all subjects; a verb with this suffix
takes no subject endings, and the verb is always repeated.(5-23) a. pororŋo pororŋo ŋgakre mbɨdtak

162         5 Basic verb morphology5.6 Reflexive and reciprocal constructionsReflexive and reciprocal constructions are formed by adding the suffix -ano
(-ŋano after a vowel) to the subject pronoun.
     In reflexive constructions, the valency of a verb is decreased, so a verb that
normally takes two arguments – a subject and object – instead only takes one.
There is no explicit grammatical marking of this decreasing valency other than in
the fact that a verb in a reflexive construction is always intransitive.(5-24) a. awin nanuknɨ ŋaŋano taniet
          awin nanuk =nɨ       ŋa -ŋano ta   -niet
          mirror        =loc 1sg -refl see.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r
          ‘I saw myself in the mirror’Non singular subjects in this construction convey reciprocity:       b. yimano yim tatike
          yim -ano yim ta           -tike
          1pl -refl 1pl see.r -dl.r
          ‘the two of us saw ourselves’ or ‘saw each other’       c. ŋgɨŋano amurukuke
          ŋgɨ -ŋano amuru -kuke
          3pl -refl fight.r -dl.r
          ‘the two of them are fighting each other’This construction can also be used for emphasis, to convey that the subject does
the action alone:(5-25) a.    yuŋano nitukun!
             yu     -ŋano ni   -tu -ku       -n!
             you -refl do.sbj -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
             ‘Do it yourself!’       b. ŋgɨŋanokɨ kirawtukuro
          ŋgɨ -ŋano -kɨ          kiraw -tu -ku  -ro
          3pl -refl -emph know.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -3pl.r.s
          ‘they realize it themselves’
6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsPerhaps the single most complex feature of Tayap’s grammar is the formation
of verbs in the realis status. The realis stem forms are only used in forming the
non-future tense and the perfect aspect. However, because the realis status is
what speakers use to refer to actions and events that have occurred in the past
or are occurring in the present – as well as to make gnomic statements like ‘birds
fly’ – it is the single most frequently occurring inflectional form in the speech of
fluent Tayap speakers.
     In the speech of younger, less fluent speakers, the non-future tense is still
used, but the weakest speakers do their best to get around it as much as they can.
To manage this, they overextend the progressive aspect, which is easier to inflect,
partly because the verb stem inflects in its irrealis form and thus remains consist-
ent, and partly because the suffixes that encode person and number that follow
the verb stem have minimal variation (see Section 5.3).
     The realis status is another kettle of fish. Its inflectional forms are irregular
both in terms of the kinds of changes that occur in verb stems, and also in terms
of their relative predictability. Transitive and intransitive verbs have very different
inflectional patterns.
     The following section (Section 6.1) discusses transitive verbs; intransitive
verbs are discussed separately in Section 6.2.","[178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]"
"5.3 Object (o) and subject (s/a) suffixes5.3.1 Object suffixesBefore going on to discuss the range of TAM distinctions made in Tayap, it will
be useful to distinguish the various forms of the object and subject suffixes that,
together with the verb stems, encode TAM on a verb.
     Taking the object suffixes first, note how their forms in irrealis are simply
the realis forms with an r inserted before the vowel in all cases except 1sg, which
retains the same form in both statuses. Interestingly, only the 3pl is distinguished
from the other non-singular suffixes in both paradigms:

5.3.2 Subject (S/A) suffixesTayap’s subject (S/A) suffixes can be compared in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 below. Irrealis
subject suffixes only mark gender for singular subjects, and realis subject suffixes
do not mark gender at all. Both paradigms collapse second person non-singular,
they distinguish third person plural, and they collapse first and third person
dual. Note that these complex syncretisms are different in different paradigms
(see Section 3.5 for other pronoun paradigms, including the free pronouns and
benefactive suffixes).","[164, 165]"
