                      7.6     Non-Declarative
                                In this section, I discuss three types of constructions that can be subsumed
                      together under the label non-declarative.             As Payne (1997:294) points out,
                      declarative clauses “simply assert information”.              This is typically the unmarked
                      clause in a language.         There are many other clause types that do not involve such
                      an assertion.      I discuss three of these below for Nxa?amxcin:             interrogatives
                      (yes/no questions), imperatives and prohibitives.",[337]

                               Yes/No questions in Nxa?amxcin are marked by sa?, which I represent
                      here as a particle, but its status remains unclear.         Some examples of sa?, which is
                      often recorded without the final glottal stop, are given below:

                             In addition it is not possible for a lexical suffix to function as the head of a

                     If the bound stems in (209) to (211) were incorporated nouns, there should be a
                     trace remaining in the V-complement position that heads the relative clause.        The
                     fact that modifier stranding is not possible in Nxa?amxcin bound stem
                     constructions but is in NI constructions suggests that the structures of these
                     examples are quite different.
                             Wh-questions show further evidence of stranding effects in Mohawk.
                     Baker argues that since incorporated nouns originate in direct object position,

                     originate in the direct object position as well. He gives the Mohawk example in
                     (212) to illustrate this point:                     (212)   ?* thka     t-a-hse-wir-a-hkw-e’?

                     The example in (212) is ungrammatical since, under Baker’s analysis, the wh-
                     element ‘who’ and the incorporated noun ‘baby’ originate in the same syntactic
                     position which in unacceptable in X’-theory.          However, a similar construction
                     using the wh-element ka nikdya ‘which’ is possible, as in (213):
                     (213)   Ka nikdya t-a-hse-wir-a-hkw-e’?
                             which       DUP-FUT-2sS-baby-@-pick.up-PUNC
                             Which baby are you going to pick up?                                 Baker 1996:323
                     Baker claims that the grammatical difference between (212) and (213) lies in the
                     fact that the wh-element in (212) originates within an NP whereas the wh-element
                     in (213) adjoins to an NP.        In (213) ka nikdya ‘which’ is outside of the NP and
                     therefore has no link to the head position within NP.          In summary, ‘who/what’-
                     type questions should not be possible if an incorporated noun is the question
                     target, while ‘which’ type questions should be possible.
                             The bound stem data indicates that neither of these are possible in
                     Nxa?amxcin.       Bound stems cannot be questioned using any wh-element.             Some
                     examples are given in (215) and (217):

                     4.2    Schwa
                              Schwa vowels appear regularly in Nxa?amxcin surface forms, which raises
                     the question of whether schwa should be considered part of the phonological
                     vowel inventory in (2). This question has surfaced for other Salishanists working
                     on languages throughout the Salish family.          Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade
                     (1998:10) claim that “[t]he phonemic status of schwa is questionable for most, if
                     not all, Salish languages” (see also Kinkade 1993, 1998a).2.           Czaykowska-Higgins
                     (1993a) and Willett and Czaykowska-Higgins (1995) specifically argue that
                     schwa is not present underlyingly in Nxa?amxcin. Kinkade (1993) suggests that

                      7.8 Summary
                              In this chapter, I discussed various operations that place at the level of the
                      inflectional stem. In section 7.1 I outlined how person, number and grammatical
                      relation features are marked for intransitive subjects, transitive subjects and
                      objects, and possessive.     In section 7.2 I looked at two aspectual operations that
                      are relevant to viewpoint aspect:      perfective and imperfective aspect.         Section 7.3
                      briefly addressed the category mood, more specifically the operation marking
                      irrealis along with various particles used to mark potential, deontic and
                      probability.   Temporal markers indicating past and future were discussed in
                      section 7.4 followed by negation in 7.5. Three operations subsumed under the
                      label non-declarative—interrogative (yes/no questions), imperative and
                      prohibitive—are the focus of section 7.6. Finally nominalization, previously
                      discussed as a derivational operation in chapter 6, is considered as an inflectional
                      operation in section 7.7.
                              The following chapter addresses compound formation in Nxa?amxcin, a
                      process that takes place before any derivational or inflectional operations are
                      realized.",[348]

                      The above examples involve monovalent stems marked for habitual aspect. The
                      only bivalent stem I have seen in the data is actually a surface intransitive, shown
                     in (316):

                     The predicate is marked transitive in (316), but the subsequent reflexive marking
                     results in an intransitive predicate.
                           The habitual forms in (313) to (316) clearly have a predicative function.
                     Many habitual forms, however, have a nominal interpretation as evidenced from
                     the translations provided by the speakers.         Some examples are given below:

                     Supervisors:      Dr. Leslie Saxon and Dr. Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins                                                              ABSTRACT
                             This dissertation is the first grammatical sketch of the Nxa’amxcin (Moses-
                     Columbian) language.        Nxa’amxcin is an endangered member of the Southern
                     Interior branch of the Salish language family, a linguistic group indigenous to the
                     Pacific Northwest region of North America.           Building on previous work by other
                      Salish linguists, I address to varying degrees all three major aspects of the
                     grammar (phonology, syntax and morphology) from a Lexeme-Morpheme Base
                     Morphology approach to word formation (Beard 1995).
                             A brief introduction to the phonology of Nxa’amxcin provides a look at
                     the segment inventory, the status of schwa, various segmental processes, and
                      syllable structure.    An overview of the syntax focuses on aspects of the noun
                     phrase—determiners, demonstratives, locative prepositions, genitive
                     marking—and the major clause types—simple clauses, relative clauses and
                      fronting.
                             An extensive discussion of lexical operations (derivational morphology)
                     addresses the categories of valence, voice, secondary aspect, control, category-
                     changing operations, and operations marking locative, augmentative, diminutive
                     and relational.     An overview of inflectional operations (inflectional morphology)
                     is presented starting with the marking of person, number and grammatical relation
                     on the predicate.      Viewpoint aspect, mood, temporal marking, negation, non-
                     declarative operations—yes/no questions, imperative, prohibitive—and
                     nominalization are also discussed.
                             A description of the three different types of compounds found in
                     Nxa’amxcin—two involving free stems and the third (known as lexical
                     affixation) comprising a free stem and a bound stem—is provided along with the
                     corresponding word structure rules responsible for these compounds.                  A number
                     of arguments in support of a compounding analysis of bound stem constructions
                     (lexical affixation), as opposed to a syntactic analysis, are presented.            The set of
                     classifiers that has developed from lexical affixation is also addressed.","[2, 3]"

                     5.1   Lexical Categories
                             In this section I briefly address the question of lexical categories in
                     Nxa?amxcin.       Before beginning any discussion of Nxa?amxcin lexical
                     categories, however, it is important to address the ongoing controversy in the
                      Salish literature over the status of nouns and verbs as independent lexical
                     categories.    Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade (1998:35) remark that “[o]ne of
                     the important controversies in the study of Salish languages concerns the
                     question of whether or not these languages exhibit a distinction between the
                     categories ‘noun’ and ‘verb’ ”. This is an issue that has long been debated in
                     the field of Salish studies. Researchers such as Kuipers (1968), Hukari (1977),
                     Demers and Jelinek (1982, 1984), Kinkade (1983b), Jelinek (1993, 1995, 1998)
                     and Jelinek and Demers (1994) have argued, based on morphological and/or
                     syntactic evidence in various Salish languages, that Salish does not distinguish
                     between nouns and verbs.        In essence, there is no lexical category [+V, -N]
                     indicating verb, and no lexical category [-V, +N] indicating noun.
                             Van Eijk and Hess (1986), Beck (1995, 2002), Demirdache and
                     Matthewson (1996), N. Mattina (1996), Haag (1998), and Davis and Matthewson
                     (1999) have all argued for a noun-verb distinction using morphological and/or
                     syntactic arguments for a wide array of Salish languages.           Kroeber (1999:33-36)
                     also adopts this approach.      The general claim is that at the lexical level there are
                     two distinct categories [+V, -N] and [-V, +N], even though these categories may
                     have fewer properties distinguishing them from each other than in other language
                     families.
                             While the general debate has focused on nouns vs. verbs, the status of

                       Examples (214) and (216) show that it is possible to form wh-questions without
                       the bound stem; however, when bound stems relating to the wh-element surface
                       on the predicate, the examples are rejected, as in (215) and (217).          If Nxa?amxcin
                       bound stem constructions were formed under the same syntactic conditions as
                       noun incorporation, we would expect (217) to be grammatical under Baker’s
                       analysis.    The fact that this is not the case further suggests that the structures of
                       incorporated noun clauses and bound stem clauses are quite different.","[424, 425]"

                     contain nominalized predicates.
                              In addition to the types of constructions found above, nominalized
                     predicates also appear in relative clauses (section 5.4), as in the following

                             Up to this point I have made the assumption that constructions involving
                     bound stems are a type of compounding in Nxa?amxcin.                Bound stem
                     constructions are found throughout the Salish family, but there has not been any
                     general agreement as to where in the grammar these constructions are formed.
                     Some Salishanists have argued that these constructions, referred to as lexical
                     affixation, are a syntactic phenomenon (at least for some instances of lexical
                     affixation).   Some have concluded that this phenomenon developed from free
                     stem compounding, which could suggest that lexical affixation is an alternate
                     type of compounding and hence a lexical phenomenon.                In this section I provide
                     support for the latter view.
                             I first provide a review of the literature on lexical affixation, including a
                     discussion of previous analyses of lexical affixation.         I then look at the nature of
                     lexical affixes in the grammar addressing the question of whether they are stems
                     or affixes realized by the Morphological Spelling Component.              I then discuss
                     properties of lexical affixation that support a compounding analysis.           Finally, I
                     pursue the syntactic noun incorporation angle, providing an initial review of the
                     literature on noun incorporation and then comparing data in Nxa?amxcin with
                     that of Mohawk to illustrate the syntactic differences between lexical affixation
                     in Nxa?amxcin and noun incorporation in Mohawk.","[389, 390]"

                     Examples (180) to (182) illustrate the introduction of a participant via an
                     independent nominal which, according to coreferencing judgements, is
                     subsequently referred to by a lexical suffix.
                             Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart note, however, that the results of
                     these tests are not conclusive.     These examples were elicited in isolation and the
                     coreferential interpretation may have been forced by pragmatics.              Such
                     interpretations can easily be forced with English compounds.               Consider the
                     following examples:
                     (183)   I went moose;-hunting on Sunday, and let me tell you, they; were pretty
                             scarce.
                     (184)   I went berry;-picking yesterday, and Mary ate them.                  C,W&B    1996:37
                     (185)   The strawberries; are ripe now, so I went berry;-picking.            C,W&B    1996:37
                     English speakers were consulted for judgments on coreferentiality in examples
                     (183) to (185).     The coreferencing marked in these examples was agreed upon by
                     all speakers.     Thus, speakers felt that the compounded noun ‘moose’ in (183) was
                     coreferential with the pronoun ‘they’, the compounded noun ‘berry’ in (184)
                     was coreferential with the pronoun ‘them’, and the independent noun

                     These results are clearly problematic and Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart
                     raised questions as to the grammatical accuracy of the judgements in (177) to
                     (182) in light of results like those in (183) to (185).
                             With bound stem constructions resembling compounding with respect to
                     word structure rules and the generic interpretation of nominals, I now present
                     additional support for a compound analysis of lexical affixation based on
                     syntactic properties.","[409, 410]"

                                                                                                                 385                     In examples (156) to (160), an [a] segment surfaces between the free stem and the
                     lexical suffix =spantk ‘year’. It is obligatory in these cases, unlike with the
                      =sqaxa? examples in (151) and (152).
                             The question that remains is what is the nature of this [a] segment?            If [a]
                     were an epenthetic vowel, it would not have optional status in (152).               One could
                     argue that it is an excrescent vowel, which would explain the optionality;
                     however it consistently surfaces as [a] no matter what the preceding segment is,
                     and excrescent vowels tend to be environmentally conditioned.               I will argue here
                     that this [a] segment is the compound connector -a?- for two reasons.               First, when
                     it appears it consistently surfaces between a free stem and a bound stem, the
                     exact position where we would expect it to surface if it were a free stem
                     compound (i.e. immediately following the lefthand compounded stem).                  The fact
                     that [t] does not appear can be accounted for on phonetic grounds:              t    > @/_-s.
                              Second, the fact that [a] only surfaces before -sqaxa? and -spantk is
                     significant.   These bound stems are clearly new in the language as they still retain
                     the shape of an independent noun.         The examples in (152) and (156) to (160) are
                     most likely indicative of an intermediary stage between a#+-compound formation
                     and the emergence of new bound stems in the language.
                             Further support for this idea can be found in the phonological forms of the
                     lexical suffixes themselves.      Consider the following synchronic list of lexical
                     suffixes:

                     Out of 39 lexical suffixes that are synchronically productive, 26 of them have [a]
                     as the initial segment and 7 of these have [at] as the first two segments.          Recall
                     that one type of compounding in Nxa?amxcin involved the combination of two
                     stems with an intervening connector -a#-. The prevalence of [a] and [at] at the
                     left edge of the lexical suffixes in (161) suggests that these forms developed from
                     righthand stems in a#-compounds.17
                             The question to be addressed here is as follows:         Are complex words
                     involving lexical affixation formed by compounding, which I assume to be a
                     lexical process, or by some word formation process at the level of syntax?","[396, 397, 398, 399]"

                     the largest part of this grammatical sketch. In this chapter I first looked at the
                     category valence examining various types of intransitives as well as four different
                     valence-changing operations: transitive, causative, applicative and external
                     possession.    The following section on voice was divided into two parts:
                     pragmatic voice and semantic voice. The former comprises topical object, passive,
                     antipassive and indefinite object operations, and the latter middle, reflexive and
                     reciprocal operations.     Secondary aspect was addressed in the following section
                      focusing on stative, inchoative, habitual, repetitive and iterative aspect.        Two
                      operations which indicate an agent’s lack of control over a situation were then
                      addressed.    These operations, referred to in the literature as out-of-control and
                      limited control, are subsumed under the label control. Five different category-
                      changing operations were looked at in the following section, four of which
                      involve nominalization—general, instrumental, agentive, and potentially locative
                      prefixing—and one creating adjectival stems.          The category locative was the
                      focus of the next section for which there are seven positional and three
                      directional operations.    The category dimension comprises two reduplicative
                      operations:   augmentative and diminutive.        And finally, the operation relational
                      was viewed independently as it did not seem to belong with any of the other
                      larger categories.
                              Chapter 7 presented an overview of inflectional operations in
                      Nxa?amxcin. The marking of person, number and grammatical relational was first
                      reviewed, followed by a discussion of viewpoint aspect, specifically perfective
                      and imperfective operations. I then took a brief look at mood, an area requiring
                      more attention in Salish languages.       I examined the irrealis operation and briefly
                      touched on potential, deontic and probability mood.          The temporal marking of
                      past and future was addressed, followed by the two patterns of negation that are
                      found in the language.      The following section contained non-declarative
                      operations:   yes/no questions, the imperative, and the prohibitive. Finally, |
                      looked at nominalized constructions.
                              In Chapter 8 I investigated the three types of compounds that are present
                      in Nxa?amxcin:       at-compounds, unmarked compounds and bound stem

                     grammar, arguing that these constructions should be viewed as a type of
                     compounding as opposed to syntactic noun incorporation.
                             The goal of this dissertation has been the creation of the first grammatical
                     sketch of the Nxa?amxcin language.          It is hoped that this sketch will fill a void
                     until a more comprehensive grammar of Nxa?amxcin is available.","[428, 429, 430]"

                      ‘throwing sticks’.
                              The glottal infix, used to mark inchoative aspect on strong roots, raises an
                      interesting question regarding the prosodic structure of roots.          Kinkade
                      (1989b:117) points out that reduplication processes on bases containing the infix

                     of the root is copied (section 3.3.2.1). It is clear that the inchoative infix -?- is
                     recognized as C2 in these forms as the glottal stop is targeted for reduplication.","[211, 212]"

                      constructions.    In direct active clauses, this particle marks the object of transitives
                      and the subject (with some possible restrictions) of intransitives.            For this reason it
                      has been referred to by Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) and Willett (1996) as
                      an absolutive marker.      If we compare bivalent active clauses with the bivalent

                      6.5        Category-Changing
                             In section 5.1, I briefly discussed an ongoing question in Salish linguistics
                      regarding lexical categories: Do Salish languages distinguish between the
                      categories noun and verb?       Discussion in the literature has generally centred on a
                      noun-verb distinction, but of course the status of adjectives is equally relevant.
                      As noted in section 5.1, | am assuming in this work that the categories noun, verb
                      and adjective are distinguished at the lexical level in Nxa?amxcin, even though
                      any of these three can serve a predicative function at the level of syntax. Having
                      made this assumption, I now turn to the various category-changing operations in
                      Nxa?amxcin that create nouns and adjectives, which are marked on the
                      following derivational stem:
                      (440)       Derivational Stem
                      [Ds NM DIR POS ASP DIM CTR ASP[Lx (Y) VROOT (Z) ]Lx DIM ASP CTR VC RL VAL VC NM ]ps
                            tt                                                    t 1                    i}                     Both general and agentive nominalization are marked in the left most nominalizer
                     position. Adjectival operations are marked by a combination of two
                     morphological spelling operations. The first is suffixal CVC-reduplication,
                     indicated by the rightmost DIM category in (440). This reduplicative process is
                     also used to mark predicates augmentative, hence the label “dimension” in (440).
                     The second involves suffixation to the right edge of the root, indicated by the
                     right most ASP category in (440) as this is the same operation used to mark
                     predicates stative. The right most nominalizer position indicates where
                     instrumental nominalization is marked on the stem.",[246]
"
                               Compare example (545) with (544).         They both contain the predicate ‘to
                      wait for’, but the speaker in (544) uses the prefix k’#- while the speaker in (545)
                      uses the prefix kt-. Examples (546) to (548) also illustrate the positional meaning
                      associated with k’?-, but the speaker has chosen to use k#- instead.
                             Like the positional prefix k-, the prefix k’?- can surface on predicates
                      involving some kind of communicative event, the following example:
                      (549)    k?tk*dncntx’
                               k?4-k”an=cin-nt-x”
                               POS-grab=language-TR-(3AB)-2sS

                     6.6.1.5 n-/na-
                              This positional prefix, which Kinkade (1999) glosses as ‘into, onto’, is the
                     first in this list of locatives to involve two variants: na- and n-. It is not clear
                     which of these is underlying, but their distribution is predictable.
                               Examples (550) to (552) below illustrate both forms of the n(a)- positional
                     prefix:
                     (550) kn        _—naq’iltc’a?

                      1.3 Outline of the Dissertation
                                This dissertation is very much a data-oriented as opposed to results-
                      oriented piece of work which basically falls into two parts. The first part, chapters
                      2 and 3, provide background information to the second part, the grammatical
                      sketch.    Nxa?amxcin falls under the traditional label “polysynthetic” as words
                      tend to be long and morphologically complex.           As a result, understanding how
                      words are put together in this language is relevant to essentially all aspects of its
                      grammar.      Thus, I begin by outlining the theoretical approach to word formation
                      adopted in this work.     A lexeme-based approach to word formation (Matthews
                      1972, 1991; Aronoff 1976, 1994; Anderson 1992; Beard 1995) has proved to
                      have the best explanatory value in the case of Nxa?amxcin.              Chapter 2 provides
                      an introduction to Beard’s (1995) Lexeme-Morpheme Base Morphology and a
                      brief comparison of this lexeme-based framework with a morpheme-based
                      approach like Lieber (1992).       Note that it is not the purpose here to argue for the
                      superiority of any particular theoretical viewpoint.        I am incorporating a
                      theoretical framework simply as a tool to facilitate a description of the language.
                                In chapter 3, I present an analysis of Nxa?amxcin word structure,
                      specifically focusing on the concepts of root and lexeme.          I argue for a lexemic
                      (as opposed to roof) stem domain in addition to a derivational and inflectional
                      stem at the level of morphological word structure.         I compare my analysis with
                      that of Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998), who proposes a morphological root
                      domain.     I then adopt Czaykowska-Higgins’ analysis that the root is the primary
                      domain at the level of phonological word structure.
                                Having established a theoretical framework and an analysis of the internal
                      structure of words, I then turn to the second part of the dissertation, which is the
                      grammatical sketch. In Chapter 4, I provide a brief introduction to Nxa?amxcin
                     phonology.       Following works by Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade, I discuss
                     the segment inventory of the language, the status of schwa, various segmental
                     processes, syllable structure and stress. In Chapter 5, I present a description of
                     Nxa?amxcin syntax. I first briefly look at the question of whether or not lexical
                     categories should be distinguished in Nxa?amxcin based on an ongoing debate
                     in Salish linguistics. Assuming that verbs, nouns and adjectives are distinct

                     categories in Nxa?amxcin, I then turn to the syntax of noun phrases, simple
                     clauses, relative clauses and fronting constructions.
                             The morphology of Nxa?amxcin is an extensive topic, and is divided here
                     into three separate chapters. Chapter 6 is an overview of lexical operations in the
                     language (i.e. derivational morphology). In this chapter, I address the categories
                     of valence, voice, aspect, control, category-changing operations, locative,
                     dimension (i.e. augmentative, diminutive), and relational. Chapter 7 is an
                     overview of inflectional operations (i.e. inflectional morphology).           Categories
                     discussed are person, number and grammatical relation, viewpoint aspect, mood,
                     temporal marking, negation, non-declarative speech (i.e. interrogative, imperative,
                     prohibitive), and nominalization.
                              The focus of Chapter 8 is compounding, for which I distinguish three
                      separate types in Nxa?amxcin.        The first two types involve free stems only and
                      are referred to as af-compounds and unmarked compounds. I refer to the third
                     type as bound stem compounds.            This type of compounding is generally labelled
                      lexical affixation in the literature.    I enter into the debate over whether these
                      bound stem constructions are syntactically engaged or formed by compounding,
                      and I provide morphological and syntactic arguments in support of a compound
                      analysis.

                     edge bound stem compounds:
                      (90)      N—-     X     N~   where X €   {A,N,V}
                     The above rule indicates that an adjective, noun or verb stem can combine with a
                     noun stem to form a complex noun stem.           Some examples involving adjectives are
                     given below:

                             It is possible for a verb stem to surface as the initial stem in this word
                     structure rule, but it is difficult to find examples that have not been lexicalized.
                     One clear example is found in Kinkade 1998b:
                     (97)    n-hac=aép=xn

                             There are three right-edge bound stems that are not accounted for by the
                     above word structure rules. The first of these is =ana? ‘all over’, an extension of

                     that conveys an adverbial meaning.          Consider the following examples:
                     (98)     kn      thal’hal’x”’d4na?
                                     t-hal’-hal’x”=ana?

                              POS-spill=all over-TR-(3AB)-(2sS)       +   IMP
                              You spill water on it!                                                     W7.192
                     In (98), the bound stem =ana? has the nominal interpretation of ‘ear’, while in
                     (99) it has the adverbial meaning ‘all over’.        Examples like (99) suggest that the
                     following word structure rule is operative in Nxa?amxcin:
                     (100) V > V Adv                              Two right-edge bound stems appear to have extended their core nominal
                     meaning to a verbal meaning.           The bound stem =ank has the core meaning
                      ‘stomach’ but is also glossed as ‘want’.       Compare the following examples:
                     (101)    q*tnank
                              q’tun=ank
                              big=stomach
                              big stomach (fat or pregnant)
                     (102)    lut’   kn        = n?itnank
                                                 n-?iin=ank

                              Likewise the right-edge bound stem =aya? has the core meaning ‘head’
                     which has been extended the verbal meaning ‘pretend’, as shown in (103) and
                     (104):

                             Examples (103) and (104) suggest that the following word structure rule is
                     present in the language:
                     (105)        VoVV                     The rule in (105) indicates that two verb stems can combine to form a complex
                     verb stem.
                             In the previous section we saw consistency between word structure rules
                     used to form a?-, unmarked and right-edge bound stem compounds.                     The word
                     structure rules in (100) and (105) are inconsistent with the pattern and apply to
                     only one or two bound stems respectively.          I can only speculate at this point but I
                     suspect that examples (99), (102) and (104) are not instances of bound stem
                     compounds, but rather the forms =ana?, =ank and =aya? are functioning as
                     grammatical morphemes in these examples.
                             Hinkson (1999:118) has already indicated that “[t]he suffix *an’/nak is
                     attested with desiderative force and acquires grammatical meaning in the
                     Southern Interior Salish languages Columbian and Okanagan”.                It is possible that
                      =aya? ‘pretend’ could also be subsumed under the category mood.                    With respect
                     to =aya? ‘all over’, we have already seen the prefix ni?- ‘among a bunch of
                     things’ analyzed as a grammatical marker, and it would therefore not be a stretch
                     to consider =aya? ‘all over’ as a grammatical morpheme.
                             It is very difficult to prove the status of these bound stems as lexical or
                     grammatical, and I will leave this question open for future research.","[373, 374, 375, 376]"

                      transitive, causative, applicative and external possession—which are summarized

                     operations whose morphological realizations surface within one of two positions
                     in the derivational stem, as shown below:

The first, located
                     between the control and relational suffixes, is where indefinite object voice is
                     marked. The other position is further right following the category valence. All
                     other voice markers surface in this position. Note that both positions are located
                     close to the right hand boundary between the derivational stem and the

                      between derivational and inflectional status (see Bybee 1985:20—21;32).
                      Analyses for both can be found in the Salish literature. For example, Jelinek
                      (1994, 1995) argues that voice is a syntactic category in Lummi, while N. Mattina
                      (1996) and Gerdts (1998a) consider voice to be derivational in Okanagan and
                      Halkomelem respectively.       For Nxa?amxcin, Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998)
                      considers voice to fall within the morphosyntactic domain of her
                      lexical/morphosyntactic split. Her view is primarily motivated by her analysis of
                      the dual behaviour of lexical suffixes, in that voice marking appears outside
                      “referential” lexical suffixation, which is considered morphosyntactic.              In chapter
                      seven, I adopt a compound analysis of these lexical suffixes (referred to in this
                      work as bound stems) which, for my analysis of Nxa?amxcin word formation,
                      effectively reopens the question of which operations are relevant to the syntax
                      and which are not. As discussed in section 3.4.2, in this work I am including
                      operations that can alter the lexical representations of lexemes under the
                      derivational umbrella.     Since voice operations clearly have an effect on the lexical
                     representation of lexemes in Nxa?amxcin, I consider them to take place at the
                      derivational stem level.
                              Givoén (1994, 2001) defines two separate sub-domains within the category
                     voice, one being primarily pragmatic and the other primarily semantic.                He notes
                      (2001:92) that “[e]ach of these in turn contrasts with the active-transitive voice,
                     the neutral unmarked clause type”.         I organize the sections below in accordance
                     with Givon’s (1994, 2001) voice sub-types.           I first discuss the operations that can
                     be subsumed under the heading pragmatic voice:             topical object, passive,
                     antipassive and indefinite object. I then look at those operations relevant to
                     semantic voice: middle, reflexive and reciprocal.","[156, 157, 158]"
"                     In all of the above constructions, the transitive subject NP surfaces in front of the
                     transitive predicate, as opposed to its usual post-predicate position.          Examples
                     (79) and (80) illustrate fronted nouns, (81) a fronted noun marked for possession,
                     (82) an emphatic pronoun, (83) a personal noun, and (84) and (85) determiner
                     phrases.
                             Wh-questions are always in the form of some kind of fronting.               Some
                     examples of the unmarked fronting of transitive wh-subjects are given below:

                             I have crossed many paths on this long and winding road and, as a result,
                     there are many people I wish to thank.
                             During this program, I have had a supervisory committee par excellence. |
                     cannot adequately express my gratitude towards Leslie Saxon (my supervisor
                     from the very beginning) and Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins for their patience and
                     kindness. I suspect that very few graduate students are in the fortunate position
                     of receiving such extensive feedback and encouragement. They are both
                     extraordinary teachers and mentors, and it is because of them that I made it to the
                     end.
                             Tom Hukari, my departmental member, is a great Salishanist and it has been
                     an honour to have him on my committee. He has, as usual, provided me with
                     insightful and helpful feedback.
                             I am indebted to my outside member, John Tucker, for hanging in there
                     while this dissertation dragged on, and for teaching me some very important
                     lessons on punctuation.
                             Having Paul Kroeber as my external examiner has been the icing on the
                     cake. I would like to thank him for the extensive feedback and for making the
                     effort to attend my defense in person.
                             The Nxa’amxcin speakers I worked with during this project—Agatha Bart,
                     Matilda Bearcub and the late Norine Smith—have been great teachers and
                     friends. What I learned from them goes well beyond the boundaries of
                     Nxa’amxcin grammar. Their stories and sense of humour have been an
                     educational experience with respect to both the culture of the Nxa’amxcin
                     people and life in general. I am also grateful to Dale Kinkade and Ewa
                     Czaykowska-Higgins for allowing me access to their files on Nxa’amxcin.
                             While I was on the Colville reservation, the Barts were like a second family
                     to me. Chuck, Agatha, Linda and Moyatat let me tag along wherever they went,
                     and their company made my stay in Washington State all the more pleasurable. I
                     will never forget their kindness and hospitality.
                             Many things have changed over the years in the University of Victoria
                     Linguistics Department, but one thing has remained a constant: the support
                     network that exists amongst the graduate students. Many graduate students
                     have come and gone during my time here, but that sense of support has remained
                     a constant and for that I am grateful. I dare not list any names here for fear I will
                     inadvertently omit someone. Rather, I will express my thanks to the many
                     graduate students I have crossed paths with during my program. You have made
                     this experience all the better.
                             Outside of the department there are many people I am indebted to for
                     having pulled me away from the desk. My friends on 4th floor Poole have been
                     lifesavers in more ways than one. I am sure they have no idea how important
                     they have been to me this past year. My friends throughout Victoria, in addition

                     3.4.2   Determining if a Category is Derivational or Inflectional
                             The literature outlines numerous criteria for distinguishing between
                      derivation and inflection, but in reality it has proven impossible to determine a
                      steadfast set of rules with cross-linguistic application that predict which
                      categories should be considered derivational and which inflectional.               Bybee
                      (1985) considers the derivational vs. inflectional distinction to be a gradient one
                     whereby categories most intrinsically tied to the root (i.e. derivational) are at one
                      end of a spectrum while the categories least tied to the root (i.e. inflectional) are at
                      the other.   Bybee (p.99) makes certain generalizations regarding the cross-
                      linguistic status of some categories, however acknowledging that a derivational
                      category in one language may be inflectional in another.           This is also noted by
                      Anderson (1992:82), who uses diminutive formation in Fula (Niger-Congo) and
                      English as a comparative example; the diminutive category is considered to be
                      inflectional in Fula, while in English diminutive forms are viewed as derivational.
                              Cases like this where one category can appear at different ends of a
                      spectrum depending on the language, involve more than just a distinction as to
                     where the operation actually takes place (i.e. the lexicon vs. syntax).             Bybee
                      states (1985:99) that “in cases where similar conceptual content is expressed in
                     the two different ways, we will find that the inflectional expression requires a
                     fully general meaning, while the derivational does not”. Hence, while English
                     and Fula each have a diminutive category, the claim that it is derivational in one

                     tied to the root than the latter.2!
                              Of the numerous criteria found in the literature, I have focused on five
                      while determining which categories belong at the derivational stem level and
                      which at the inflectional stem level in Nxa?amxcin: (i) the Peripheral Affix Test;
                      (ii) semantic relevance; (iii) the ability to change features in lexical
                      representations; (iv) portmanteau morphemes; (v) the Free Analog Test.
                              (i) The Peripheral Affix Test. The first of these criteria is the widely noted
                      observation (appearing as Universal 28 in Greenberg 1963 and as The
                      Peripheral Affix Test in Beard 1995) regarding the cross-linguistic consistency of
                      ordering of derivational and inflectional morphemes with respect to each other.
                      Anderson (1992:77) writes that:
                              [...] in forms where both derivational and inflectional morphology are
                              overtly represented, material corresponding to productive inflection comes
                              “outside of’ other morphology. That is, where two or more suffixes are
                              involved, inflectional ones come after derivational ones; and where
                              prefixes are involved, inflectional ones come before derivational ones.
                              Even where a prefix and a suffix are involved, an argument can sometimes
                              be constructed for the relative order in which they must have been added
                              to the stem, and in such cases as well the derivational material seems to be
                              added prior to the addition of productive inflection.
                      Thus, we can expect to find derivational morphemes closer to the root than
                      inflectional morphemes.
                              There are a number of operations in Nxa?amxcin that are quite clearly tied
                      to the root and can thus be considered derivational based on the Peripheral Affix
                      Test. These categories are marked by either morphemes or reduplicated forms and
                      always appear at the innermost core of the Nxa?amxcin word.               The inchoative
                      and out-of-control markers actually appear inside the root as infixes, as shown in
                      (45) and (46) respectively:
                             21Interestingly enough, I have often had difficulty directly eliciting
                     causative and inchoative constructions in Nxa?amxcin. While causative and
                     inchoative are clearly syntactic categories in English, they are derivational in
                     Nxa?amxcin. Under Bybee’s analysis the derivational causative and inchoative
                     categories should have meanings that are of greater relevance to the predicate
                     than the causative and inchoative categories realized as independent syntactic
                     items. This might account for the difficulty in eliciting these constructions.","[66, 67]"

                     5.2.1     Determiners and Demonstratives
                               The Nxa?amxcin determiner and demonstrative systems are addressed in
                     N. Mattina 2002 (see also Kinkade 1967b).           According to N. Mattina (p.263),
                     there are four determiners, listed in (5):5                              4Note that example (3) contains an adjective stem marked irrealis by the
                     prefix kat-. This suggests that adjectives pattern with nouns with respect to
                     irrealis marking. I do not, however, have enough adjective examples to confirm
                     this.
                              5It is very difficult to understand the underlying semantics of Nxa?amxcin
                     determiners by examining isolated texts. Both Matthewson (1998) and Kroeber
                     (1999) maintain that contrasts in Salish determiner systems are reflective of a
                     referential vs. non-referential contrast, as opposed to the definite vs. indefinite-
                     type contrast found in languages like English. N. Mattina (2002) claims,
                     however, that the Nxa?amxcin determiner system is not reflective of this
                     referential/non-referential distinction, stating (p.283) that “[t]he marking of
                     definiteness and specificity is left to other interacting systems in the grammar”.",[96]
"                      5.2.2 Obliques
                                 Oblique marking appears with noun phrases that do not have any direct
                      argument status in the clause.        Such noun phrases are described by N. Mattina
                      (2002:276) as
                                 non-locative, adjunct determiner phrases. These adjuncts are syntactically
                                 oblique in that, unlike core arguments, they are never cross-referenced on
                                 the clause head. They are also semantically oblique in the sense that they
                                 consistently show the partiality of reference similar to English some and
                                 the partitive use of plural and mass nouns, the hallmarks of non-specific
                                 phrases cross-linguistically (Ultan 1978). Likely related to this specificity
                                 is the fact that oblique phrases cannot encode possessors or occur within
                                 the scope of a strong quantifier. They are also thematically limited to a
                                 small number of semantic roles: instrument [ ], theme [ ], and factitive [ ].
                                 Oblique nouns in Nxa?amxcin are preceded by the oblique marker t, as in
                      (22) to (25):

                      patient.     The suffix -m, which was seen on the semantically unergative predicates

                                 Given the data in (9) to (21), it would appear that Nxa?amxcin makes a
                      morphological distinction between unergative and unaccusative-type verbs.             This

                      an “involuntary bodily process”.       While they pattern with the predicates in (9) to
                      (17) from a semantic perspective, they are not marked by the suffix -m.5
                              A third type of intransitive that I will address here is what Levin (1993)
                      labels the “Object of Transitive = Subject of Intransitive Alternation”-type
                      intransitive.     These are intransitive predicates in which the external argument
                      might otherwise be found as the object of the transitive alternative.          This is an
                      area that requires much more research in Nxa?amxcin.             I can provide only the
                      following observation at this point:      these intransitive predicates usually surface
                      with some kind of aspectual or control marking.          These include predicates with
                      meanings like ‘cook’, ‘burn’, ‘break’, ‘tear’, ‘rip’, ‘cut’, ‘shake’, ‘scrape’, and
                      ‘bounce’.       Some examples of out-of-control forms are given in (26) to (29):

                      8.1 What is a Compound?
                            Anderson (1992:292) defines a compound as “the combination of (two or
                      more) existing words into a new word”. Such a process, he claims, contrasts with
                      derivation and inflection which involve “the application of a Word Formation
                      Rule to a single existing word”.      A word formation rule, Anderson states,
                      “operates on a single word (or stem) to manipulate its phonological form
                      (typically, but not exclusively, by affixation) as well as its other properties.
                     Compounding, in contrast, involves the combining of stems from the lexicon into
                     a quasi-syntactic structure.”
                             While compound structures have been widely noted throughout the cross-
                     linguistic literature, the theoretical literature on compounds is relatively limited.
                     Fabb (1998:82), in his general overview of compounding, indicates that “{t]his is
                     because compounds tend to be less phonologically or morphologically active
                     than derived words, and less syntactically active than phrases: compounds are
                     relatively inert”.   The major theoretical work on compounds can be attributed to

                      DiSciullo and Williams (1987) and Anderson (1992), among others. For the
                      purposes of this work, I adopt Anderson’s (1992) analysis which is in line with
                      Selkirk’s (1982) work on compounds.!
                                Selkirk recognizes an “apparent need for particular rule statements; a
                      general X’ schema for compounding does not adequately characterize the
                      compounding possibilities found in English” (p.13). Anderson claims that
                      compounds are created by a set of word structure rules which “have much the
                      same form as phrase-structure rules, but apply only to lexical categories. Word
                      Structure Rules operate to specify the internal constituency of lexical categories
                      and (optionally) their heads” (p.299). Both Anderson and Selkirk agree that
                      these rules must be specific enough so as to rule out any gaps present in the
                      compounds of a language. Possible stem combinations as well as the feature of
                      “headedness” are very much language-specific, therefore what is available in the
                      grammar of a particular language should be encoded in its word structure rules.
                      For example, a compound of the lexical category verb comprising a verb stem and
                      a noun stem would be realized by the following Word Structure Rule:
                      dg)    VoOVN
                     The word structure rule in (1) indicates that a verb stem and a noun stem can
                     combine to form a single lexical item of the category verb. The head of the
                     compound is underlined.
                             The semantic interpretation of a compound is closely tied with the concept
                     of head.     As Selkirk (p.22) points out, “the nonhead constituent of the compound
                     in some way further defines the head; [...] the head is, intuitively speaking, the
                     nucleus of the compound”. For example, a nonhead can fill a role in the
                     argument structure of a head, but not the other way around.            Selkirk (p.22) notes,
                             1I should clarify that while Anderson’s view of compounding finds root in
                     Selkirk’s work on word structure, their views on derivation and inflection are
                     radically different in that Selkirk takes a morpheme-based approach to word
                     formation while Anderson adopts a lexeme-based view.","[349, 350]"

                      7.5 Negation
                              Payne (1997:282) describes a negative clause as “one which asserts that
                      some event, situation, or state of affairs does not hold”. A pan-Salish analysis of
                      clausal negation has appeared in H. Davis 2001 where three major patterns of
                      negation are identified in the family. As H. Davis indicates, Nxa?amxcin
                      exemplifies two patterns.      Pattern A consists of a negative particle followed by a
                      nominalized clause, as shown in the following examples:
                      (157)   lat     —_—Pis?itn
                                      ?in-s-?itn
                              NEG __ 1sPS-NM-eat
                              I didn’t eat.                                                              W.2.69
                      (158)   lit    ?isndw’lx

                              NEG    anymore      NM-steal-m-3Ps
                              He doesn’t steal anymore.                                                  W.4.92
                     All three of the above clauses contain the negation particle Jut followed by a
                     nominalized predicate.      In addition, each of the three predicates in (157) to (159)
                     is marked by the nominalizer s- with subject marking expectedly appearing in the
                     form of possessive prefixes.
                              H. Davis’s pattern C involves the negation particle lut followed by an
                     unmarked indicative clause.       Some examples are given below:

                     complement position. If object morphology is present on the verb it will absorb
                     the case-feature for that position and, as a result, nakt ‘bed’ cannot be licensed.
                     If object morphology is absent from the verb, as Baker argues it is in (197), then
                     nakt is not coindexed with any morpheme in the verb and therefore violates the
                     MVC.     However, if the head nakt incorporates into the verb via head movement
                     (Travis 1984), then the trace of nakt in the direct object position is coindexed
                     with a morpheme in the verb and passes the MVC.
                             Thus, while Mithun (1984) (as well as Mithun and Corbett (1999)) claims
                     that the N+V form in an example like (197) is functionally motivated, Baker
                     (1996) claims such forms are syntactically required. In more specific terms, noun
                     incorporation is a direct result of the Polysynthesis Parameter (or Morphological
                      Visibility Condition) which Baker claims is operative in true polysynthetic
                      languages like Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan), Rembarrnga (Gunwinyguan),
                     Nunggubuyu (Australian, non-Pama-Nyungan), Mayali (Australian), Chukchi
                      (Chukchi-Kamchatkan), Wichita (Caddoan), and languages of the Iroquoian and
                      Tanoan families.
                             Baker presents a very clear analysis of the syntactic operation involved in
                     NI formation.     He also gives a detailed discussion of the properties one would
                      expect to find in such constructions and the relevent tests to determine whether
                      or not a syntactic process has taken place. As a result, I will focus specifically on
                      Baker’s work here and use his findings and examples as tools for comparison
                     with the Nxa?amxcin data. Use of the term noun incorporation is henceforth
                      strictly in the spirit of Baker.","[417, 418, 419]"

                             In the previous two sections I discussed and compared both morpheme-
                     based and lexeme-based approaches to morphology.               The reason for the
                     comparison was, in part, to provide the background for this section where I
                     discuss one major advantage of LMBM over morpheme-based theories.
                             There are a number of cross-linguistic morphological patterns that are
                     problematic for a morpheme-based approach to morphology.                 What is often found
                     when examining the morphology of a particular language is that form and
                     function do not always show a one to one correspondence.               For example, in both
                     English and Nxa?amxcin we can find forms where more than one morpheme is
                     linked to a single function. The plural form of child in English is one example.
                     Two separate processes take place when this form is marked plural. First, there is
                     a vowel change from [a1] to [1]; second, there is the addition of the suffix -ren,
                     resulting in [Ciljron]. The following Nxa?amxcin example also illustrates this
                     kind of morphological asymmetry:
                     (10)    tex*mintn
                             tox-min-tn
                             sew-INS-INS
                             thread                                                            Kinkade   1981a:20
                     Both -min and -tn are glossed as instrumental suffixes.          In (10) we have one
                     function, instrumental, linked with two forms, -min and -tn.
                             Conversely, it is possible for one morpheme to be linked to a number of
                     different functions.    In the Nxa?amxcin example in (11), person, number and
                     grammatical function can be represented by a single form.                     (11)    ?omcinn

                     the suffix -nn represents (i) Ist person, (ii) singular and (iii) subject function,
                     illustrating that multiple functions can be associated with one form.
                               Another problem for morpheme-based theories is zero morphology:
                     meaning is present but there is no corresponding form. For example, some
                     English resultative nominalizations require affixation while others do not:                      (12)     Resultative Nominalization
                                       Affixed                               Unaffixed

                      In (12), ‘slice’, ‘roll’ and ‘find’ are nominalized without any overt marking to
                     represent this function.     The most common occurrence of zero morphology in
                     Nxafamxcin is the 3rd person absolutive.           3rd person intransitive subjects and
                     transitive objects are never overtly marked, as shown in the following examples:

                     Example (13) contains an intransitive predicate with a third person subject.             While
                     the grammatical features for third person intransitive subject are interpreted in this
                     construction, there is no overt phonological marking to indicate that the subject is
                     third person. Example (14) contains a transitive predicate with a third person
                     object.    Again, the grammatical features are present but there is no phonology
                     present to indicate third person transitive object.
                               Conversely, it is possible for a form to be present without any associated
                     meaning.     Such forms are referred to as empty morphology.          In the following

                                                             Compounding
                      8.0 Introduction
                              This chapter examines three different types of compounding found in
                      Nxa?amxcin.      The first two involve the combination of two free stems: one type
                      marked by the connector -af-, the other unmarked.           The third compound type is
                      formed from a free stem and a bound stem and is generally referred to in the
                      literature as lexical affixation.   Below I provide a description of each of the three
                      types of compounding and provide word structure rules to account for the range
                      of combinations found in the available data.         I then turn to the ongoing
                      discussion in the Salish literature on the status of bound stem compounds in the
                      grammar.    I provide support for my assumption that bound stem constructions are
                      in fact compounds by showing that they pattern more with the properties of
                      compounds than with the properties of syntactic noun incorporation.","[348, 349]"

                             Before delving into the issue of where in the grammar lexical affix
                     constructions are formed, another issue needs to be addressed:            morphologically
                     speaking, what is the actual status of lexical affixes in the grammar? Are these
                     bound forms the phonological realization of morphological spelling operations or
                     are they actually bound stems, or more precisely, lexemes, with an individual entry
                     in the lexicon as with free stems?      The properties of these lexical affixes suggest
                     that the latter is true.
                             There is pan-Salish evidence indicating that lexical affixes have lexeme-
                     like properties.   The most widely noted point is semantics:         the meanings attached
                     to these lexical affixes are of a lexical, rather than grammatical, nature. Lexical
                     affixes are representative of the lexical classes noun, verb and adjective.         These
                      semantic properties are specific to lexemes only and are not marked by
                     morphological spelling operations.        Thus, one can conclude from a semantic point
                      of view that lexical affixes are in fact lexemes and not (grammatical) morphemes.
                              Some phonological evidence has also been put forward in the Salish
                      literature indicating that lexical suffixes are more root-like than affix-like. For
                      example, in an unpublished Optimality Theory paper, Blake (1998:24) maintains
                      that lexical suffixes in St’at’imcets (Lillooet) “are analyzed phonologically as
                     belonging to the prosodic Root Domain, and as such [are] subject to Root
                      faithfulness constraints”.    In another unpublished paper, Blake (2000b) illustrates
                      that lexical suffixes in both Lillooet and Sliammon have root-like properties based
                      on the behaviour of certain adjacent segments.         For example, Blake shows that in
                      Lillooet a process of deletion takes place when two non-glottalized coronal
                      obstruents are adjacent, as in the following examples.         (Glosses are taken from

                     As shown in (162), only one [t] segment surfaces when the indirective suffix -xit
                     and the Ist plural object suffix -ttimut are realized adjacent to one another.       This
                     process of deletion also takes place in (163) when the Ist singular object suffix -c
                     follows the indirective suffix -xit, another non-glottalized coronal obstruent.        [t] is
                     deleted and only [c] surfaces.
                             Blake then illustrates that non-glottalized coronal obstruents can surface
                     as heteromorphemic geminates in the environment between (i) a root and an
                     adjacent lexical suffix, or (ii) between two adjacent lexical suffixes. Examples
                     involving a root and a lexical suffix are given in (164) and (165):

                     in the same environment.       The fact that no deletion takes place in these examples,
                     unlike examples (162) and (163), suggests that roots and lexical suffixes belong
                     to a separate domain distinct from grammatical suffixes.
                             Examples involving adjacent lexical suffixes are given in (166) and (167):

                     triggering deletion, again illustrating that lexical suffixes in Lillooet behave like
                     roots and not grammatical affixes with respect to certain deletion rules.
                             Further indications that lexical suffixes are root-like as opposed to affix-
                     like comes from Czaykowska-Higgins (to appear) work on Nxa?amxcin.                  In her
                     comparison of Nxa?amxcin lexical suffixes with both roots and grammatical
                     suffixes, Czaykowska-Higgins examines the consonant inventories of all three.
                     She states that “[r]oots contain the full range of consonants from [the]
                     underlying inventory” while grammatical suffixes “use a very restricted set of
                     segments”.     Both inventories are given in (168):

                     As Czaykowska-Higgins’ segment inventories illustrate, there is quite a
                     significant difference between the number of segments utilized in root forms and
                     the number of segments utilized in grammatical suffixes.
                             Now consider the segment inventory for lexical suffixes, given in (169):

                     While not as extensive as the root inventory, the range of consonants found in
                     lexical suffixes is nowhere near as restrictive as that for grammatical suffixes in
                     (168b).    Thus, both roots and lexical suffixes make use of a large set of
                     consonants, while grammatical suffixes are limited to a mere quarter of the
                     consonantal segments available in the language.18
                               Czaykowska-Higgins also indicates that shape constraints on lexical
                     suffixes more closely resemble those of roots rather than grammatical suffixes.
                     Czaykowska-Higgins’ comparison of the possible shapes for roots, grammatical
                     suffixes and lexical suffixes is given below:

                               18Note that Czaykowska-Higgins considers the above inventories to
                     show that “lexical suffixes are neither fully root-like, nor truly suffix-like in their
                     segmentism”.","[399, 400, 401, 402, 403]"

                      7.6.3    Prohibitive
                               Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994:179) describe the prohibitive as “a
                      negative command”.        Given this definition one might expect to find simply
                      imperative and negation marking as the morphological realization of prohibitives
                      in Nxa?amxcin.      This is not the case, however.      Prohibitive clauses do contain the
                      negative particle Jut, but there is no imperative marking.        Instead, predicates are
                      marked for irrealis mood.       Consider the following examples:

                     Like (206) to (208), the above clauses contain both the negation particle Jut and

                     The predicate taqlx in (46) is marked out-of-control by the reduplication of the
                      second consonant, resulting in taqglx.         Both of these categories are represented
                     by forms that not only appear close to the root but actually surface inside the

                     inchoative and out-of-control categories must be derivational since their markers
                      surface within the root domain.

                                                                                                               56                      Both augmentative and diminutive marking involve reduplication of some
                      segments(s) of the root (CjaC- or C;- respectively), and these reduplicative
                     prefixes appear at the immediate left edge of the root, as in (47) and (48).
                      Likewise, the stative and inchoative suffixes -t and -p always surface at the
                      immediate right edge of the root, as in (49) and (50). Given that all of the
                      morphemes highlighted in (47) to (50) appear adjacent to the root without any
                      possibility of intervening material, I assume they are markers of derivational
                      operations.
                              (ii) Semantic Relevance.        The position of derivational and inflectional
                      morphology with respect to the root directly ties in with the second observation
                      which centres on the semantic contribution of derivational and inflectional rules
                      to the word.    Scalise (1988:563) claims that derivational rules “change the
                      conceptual meaning of their base”, while inflectional rules “change the
                      grammatical meaning of their base”. This is addressed in detail in Bybee 1985,
                      who states (p.99) that:
                              [...] inflectional meaning is always very general, indeed, often so general as
                              to be redundant in context, and it is always transparent in the sense that its
                              combination with a stem always produces a predictable meaning.
                              Derivational meaning, on the other hand, has more semantic content and
                              often produces idiosyncratic meanings in combination with different
                              lexical stems.
                      According to Bybee, the greater the semantic relevance to the root, the closer the
                      morpheme will appear to the root.
                              The locative, relational, and limited control categories all provide the root
                      with some form of semantic extension, as illustrated in (51) to (53):

                      The examples in (51) illustrate the semantic contribution of a locative prefix to the
                      predicate.    The root Viot’ in isolation means ‘wet’, as in (51a). When the locative
                      prefix kat- is affixed in (51b), the predicate takes on the additional meaning that
                      the location of the wet state is on a flat surface.     The relational category also
                      contributes additional semantic properties to the predicate as it indicates some
                      action either moving away from the agent towards another entity, or moving
                      towards the agent.     This is illustrated in (52b) where the combination of the root
                      Vyovw ‘strong’, the bound stem =akst ‘hand’, and the relational suffix -min
                      indicate that something is being forced by hand either away from or towards the
                      agent.    The limited control category provides the additional meaning that
                      something was done accidentally or with difficulty.          As we see in (53b), when the
                      limited control suffix is added to the reanalyzed stem yarmin ‘push’, the
                      interpretation of the predicate becomes ‘push accidentally’.
                               All three of the above categories provide additional features to the
                      predicate beyond that of grammatical features.          These three categories extend the
                      meaning of the predicate in such ways that there are fundamental changes to the
                      meaning of the predicate if these are removed.         As a result, these categories
                      should be considered derivational.        Sentential aspect, however, has the opposite
                      effect on a predicate in that any change in sentential aspect has no effect
                      whatsoever on the semantic interpretation of the predicate of a clause.            Consider
                      the following two examples:

                      The example in (54a) appears in the unmarked perfective form, giving one a
                      closed view of the activity that took place (i.e. it is seen from start to finish). The
                      example in (54b) provides an alternate view as it is marked for imperfective
                      aspect.        In this case an open-ended view of the activity is presented with no
                      specific start or end-point.         If we change the view from closed to open, the
                      semantic integrity of the predicate is not compromised.           Whether the predicate is
                      perfective or imperfective, the meaning of the verb, in this case ‘to eat’, remains
                      constant.        This indicates that sentential aspect should be considered inflectional.
                                (iii) Ability to Change Features in Lexical Representations.             Regarding
                      the third criterion, there is a fundamental distinction between derivation and
                      inflection with respect to what each of these can do.           Scalise (1988) remarks that
                      rules of derivation seem to be more powerful than those of inflection, observing
                      (p.562) that “given a lexical representation, [derivational rules] can change
                      virtually every single bit of information attached to it, while [inflectional rules]
                      can change only a fixed set of linguistic information (gender, number, etc.)”.
                      Operations that clearly have an effect on the lexical representation of a lexeme
                      are valence-changing categories.            These categories can manipulate how many
                      participants are involved in a situation by changing the subcategorization
                      features of a lexeme.           One example of this is the category transitive which creates
                      predicates that subcategorize for two participants from predicates which would
                      normally subcategorize for one participant, as shown in (55):
                      (55)      a.        kas-k’4x-t-ox”

                      The predicate k”ax” ‘wake up’ in (55a) has not undergone any valence-
                      changing operation and, therefore, subcategorizes for a single argument.              In (55b)
                      the same predicate is marked for the operation transitive resulting in two direct
                      arguments.    Because valence-changing categories can make changes to the
                      lexical representation of a lexeme, I include them in the derivational stem level.
                              The voice categories are another example of operations that can alter the
                      lexical representations of lexemes.      This category can alter which argument in a
                      lexical representation will assume the role of subject of the predicate.           Example
                      (56a) illustrates the unmarked active voice.       In this example the agent is the
                      subject of the predicate c’alx ‘scratch’ while the theme serves as the direct
                      object. If we compare this with example (56b) marked for passive voice, the
                      theme, in this case Paci xaxal’a? ‘baby’, is now the subject of the clause while
                      the agent, pus ‘cat’, appears as an oblique object.

                     In both of the above examples, the locative argument in bold is followed by a
                     determiner and an indicator of location, Ici ‘in there’, which is formed by the
                     locative prefix / ‘in, at, on’ and the root Vci. These are then followed by the
                     remainder of the relative clause in brackets.
                             Kroeber (1999:257) points out that “[i]n the Coast Salish languages
                     (except for Lushootseed, apparently) and in Lillooet, moreover, a transitive
                     relative clause may precede its head, provided that the relative clause contains no
                     overt DP or PP arguments”. This also appears to be possible for Nxa?amxcin, but
                     one example suggests that (at least) the overt PP restriction within the relative
                     clause does not hold for Nxa?amxcin.             In addition, intransitive relative clauses
                     can precede their heads.      Consider the following examples:

                     In all of the above examples, the relative clause is preceded by either the article
                     rani alone ((72), (74), and (75)) or an article phrase plus adjective (73). The head
                     noun of the relativized argument appears at the end of the relative clause.
                     Examples (74) and (75) illustrate that an intransitive relative clause can also
                     precede its head.     Example (75) suggests that the head of a Nxa?amxcin relative
                     clause can follow the relative clause predicate, even when the relative clause
                     contains an overt PP.
                             Headless relative clauses are also possible in Nxa?amxcin, a construction
                     which Kroeber 1999:258 notes is common to all Salish languages.                   Kroeber
                     explains that these relative clauses are “ones in which neither target nor head
                     position is filled by a DP [...]. These constructions consist simply of a relative
                     clause preceded by an article”.       Some examples are given below:

                     Each of the above constructions contain a headless relative clause in that there is
                     no nominal present to represent the relativized argument; only the article ?ani
                     precedes the relative clause.","[112, 113, 114]"

                     7.2.2 Imperfective
                             Unlike the perfective, imperfective viewpoint aspect is overtly marked on
                     the predicate in Nxa?amxcin. Smith (1997:73) indicates that “[i]mperfective
                     viewpoints present part of a situation, with no information about its endpoints [...]
                     The unmarked imperfective spans an interval that is internal to the situation”.
                     This is in contrast with the perfective in which a situation is viewed in its entirety.
                             Two major semantic types of imperfectives are evident in the data, each of
                     which are marked by the same affixes. The first involves events which are in
                     progress, i.e. neither the startpoint nor endpoint are brought into focus. Some
                     examples are given in (57) to (59):

                      Each of the above examples present events either in progress ((57) and (58)) or to
                      be in progress (59). Example (57) focuses on the fact that someone is in the
                     process of bothering people.   No attention is paid to the beginning or end of this
                      event, only the period between start and finish. Example (58) indicates that the
                      imperfective viewpoint can also be applied to nouns with a predicative function,
                      e.g. yalmix”m ‘chief’. And finally, example (59) indicates that imperfective
                     viewpoint is not restricted to present time.       Unrealized events can also be viewed
                      as imperfective.
                            The second type of imperfective found in the data involves an open-ended
                     view of repeated events. Thus, the event itself is not necessarily in progress, but
                     the repetition of the event is. Consider the following examples:

                      takes place, even though the focus is not on the event itself being in progress.

"                      6.2.1.1    Topical Object
                                Topical object constructions in Salish were first labelled and defined by
                      Kinkade (1989a, 1990b), who provides a pan-Salish discussion of this
                      operation.18 He defines (1990b:343) the topical object construction as follows:
                                The main function of the topical object as contrasted with the plain (often
                                zero) third-person object is to keep track of a topic in a section of
                                discourse when there is more than one third-person referent present and
                                the one that is topic has been shifted into a patient role and designated by
                                a pronominal object marker. In order to maintain its topicality, it is
                                specially marked.
                                Topical object voice constructions resemble inverse voice constructions
                      with respect to relative topicality.     Givén (2001:155) writes that “inverse voice
                      constructions are used in discourse contexts when the patient outranks the agent
                      in topicality, thus contrasting with the agent-topicalizing active-direct; but the
                      agent-of-inverse remains topical, thus contrasting with the radically suppressed
                      agent-of-passive”.     In line with inverse constructions, the specific function of
                      topical object voice appears to be signalling that the patient is topic.           Unlike
                      passive voice, the agent still holds some degree of topicality. Following Givén’s
                      schema in (94), we can represent the relative topicality of agent and patient in
                      topical object voice as follows:
                             18Kinkade identifies Nxa?amxcin, Upper Chehalis, Cowlitz, Quinault,
                      Tillamook and Lushootseed as having topical object constructions. See H. Davis
                      (1994) for analysis of a cognate in Lillooet.",[160]

                               The positional prefixes are outlined in Kinkade (1999), who defines them
                      as “a set of seven prefixes that indicate position in relation to something” (p.96).
                      They consist of the following prefixes:

                     Both bound stems =ups and =us appear to have a classificatory use in (146) and
                      (148) in that they cooccur with numerals to indicate a “type” of something.
                     Example (147) leaves us with a broad scope as we do not know if =ups is
                     reflective of the SHAPE/DIMENSION or FUNCTION of ‘bitterroot’.
                                   The number of bound stems functioning as numeral classifiers is much
                      smaller than those functioning as compounded stems.            Only a subset of these
                     bound stems have emerged with a classifier usage, which seems to be the case for
                     other Salish languages as well. While numeral classifiers are homophonous with
                     their compound counterparts, they differ from the compound bound stems in
                     three important ways: (i) they combine primarily with numerals and quantifiers; (ii)
                     they can cooccur with a coreferenced direct noun; and (iii) their semantic
                     interpretations are much broader.
                                   With respect to the first property, we see in examples (124) to (148) that
                     Nxaramxcin classifiers combine primarily with numerals (e.g. (124) and (141))
                     and quantifiers such as k’“inx ‘how many’ (e.g. (129) and (139)).             However, a
                     handful of examples indicate that the use of these classifiers is spreading to
                     adjective stems (e.g. (130) and (138)).
                                   Turning to the second property, a number of examples provide clear
                     evidence that classifiers can cooccur with a coindexed direct noun phrase (e.g.
                     (127), (130), (134) and (137-139)). As will be addressed in section 8.4.4.2.1, this
                     property is specific to the classifier usage of these bound stems and is prohibited
                     with the compound usage.
                                   Many classifiers also differ from compound bound stems in their semantic
                     interpretation.          The following table provides a comparison:

                     A number of the classifiers in (149) are given an identical gloss with their lexical
                      suffix counterpart.        Other classifiers, however, take on much broader semantics.
                      Take for example =a/?st ‘round’, =alq” ‘long and thin’, and =ap ‘round’.              Unlike
                     the lexical suffix counterparts, these classifiers do not refer to specific items, but
                     rather categorize the SHAPE/DIMENSION of a corresponding noun.               This distinction
                     is in line with Gerdts, Hinkson and Hukari’s (2002:150) observation for
                     Halkomelem that such bound stems become “acategorial and semantically
                     bleached when used as a classifier”.
                             From the data examined, it appears that three of the classifiers in (149),
                      =kan ‘container’, =qinwil ‘load’ and =dtiy’a? ‘something flat’, are no longer
                     used productively to form bound stem compounds, but have maintained a

                                In Nxa?amxcin, reflexive operations take place on bivalent stems and are
                     marked by the suffix -cut. Kinkade (1982b:59) considers this form to have
                     derived from the combination *-t-sut, involving a transitive suffix followed by the
                     proto-Salish reflexive marker *-sut (see Kroeber 1999:32). It is impossible to
                     determine if the suffix -sut has become -cut since the reflexive marker always
                     follows bivalent stem markers, all of which end in [t] with the exception of -stu
                     which is reduced to -st when followed by the reflexive marker (Czaykowska-
                     Higgins 1993a). Because [t] + [s] is always realized as [c], it is impossible to tell if
                     the reflexive marker is -sut or -cut underlyingly. I will follow Kinkade (1982b)
                     here and assume it is -cut.
                                Almost all of the reflexive examples I have found in the data involve
                     transitive stems. As the following examples illustrate, the reflexive marker follows
                     the transitive suffix and the resulting predicate is intransitive:

                      This example illustrates that Nxa?amxcin reflexives can involve coreferencing
                      between an agent and a goal argument (as opposed to patient).
                              There are two morphological features in the above examples that indicate
                      reflexive predicates are surface intransitives. First, in example (211), 1st person sg.
                      subject agreement is realized as the clitic kn. Subject marking in the form of clitics
                      is restricted to intransitive clauses.    Second, the predicates in (215) and (216) are
                      marked imperfective by the affixes sc- and -mix. These affixes are restricted to
                      intransitive predicates.
                              There appears to be a semantic restriction on Nxa?amxcin reflexive
                      constructions in that the coreferenced agent and patient must be human.             The
                      following example indicates that non-human NPs cannot form reflexive
                      constructions:

                      and the -n- segment.     From a semantic perspective one would expect the two to
                      be mutually exclusive as the former indicates lack of control on the part of an
                      agent while the latter supposedly indicates an agent has control over a situation.
                      The data in (44) to (45) indicates, however, that they are not mutually
                      exclusive.10 Throughout this work I will consider -nt to be a single morpheme
                      marking the transitive operation on perfective predicates.1!          I do not address the
                      notion of control with respect to transitive marking, and refer the reader to
                      Kroeber 1999:28—30 for a pan-Salish view.
                              If a predicate is imperfective, the transitive marker is -stu, the same suffix
                      used to mark predicates causative.        This was noted by Kinkade (1982b:50) who
                      writes that “[i]mperfective aspect forms have generalized the use of ‘causative’
                      so that all transitive non-perfective forms include -stu- (although not all
                      causatives are non-perfective)”.      Some examples of imperfective transitive
                      predicates are given below:

                     2.2 The Lexeme-Morpheme Base Model
                               As outlined in the previous section, the general assumptions in a
                     morpheme-based model of word formation are: (i) the morpheme is the minimal
                     element in word formation; (ii) the morpheme constitutes a linguistic sign; and (iii)
                     all morphemes are found in the lexicon. Beard’s (1995) theory of Lexeme-
                     Morpheme Base Morphology, and other lexeme-based theories such as Aronoff
                      1976, 1994, and Anderson 1992, argue against all of these assumptions, as word
                     formation is viewed in terms of two distinct entities: the morpheme and the
                     lexeme.     I will take these three assumptions as my focus of comparison between

                     model referring occasionally to specific points from other lexeme-based theories.
                             LMBM theory differs from all three general assumptions of a morpheme-
                     based theory, as we will see in section 2.2.1. First, Beard argues that the
                     morpheme is not the minimal element in a grammar, but rather both lexemes and
                     morphemes constitute minimal elements.           The distinction between lexemes and
                     morphemes correlates with open-classed and closed-class elements respectively.
                     The lexeme is the minimal element within an open class while the morpheme is the
                     minimal element within a closed class.
                             With respect to the second assumption, Beard claims that it is the lexeme
                     and not the morpheme that constitutes a linguistic sign, the reason being that
                     only the lexeme is comprised of mutually implied phonological, grammatical and
                     semantic features. The morpheme is not considered to be an indivisible set of
                     features, but is rather the phonological marking of a grammatical or semantic
                     operation on a stem. The morpheme is comprised of phonological features only,
                     not grammatical or semantic features.
                             Finally, Beard claims that only open-class items, i.e. lexemes, are contained
                     in the lexicon.    The operations involving grammatical features are found in the
                     grammar, operations involving semantic features are found in the semantic
                     component, and the morphemes themselves are stored in, or produced by rules of,
                     the Morphological-Spelling Component.            There are no morphological items and
                     no morphological spelling rules in the lexicon.
                             The fact that LMBM differs on all three major assumptions of a morpheme-
                     based theory is a preliminary indication that this theory takes a radically different
                      approach to word formation than theories put forward by Lieber (1981, 1992),
                      Selkirk (1982), Scalise (1984), Sproat (1985), DiSciullo and Williams (1987) and
                     Baker (1988, 1996).      In the following sections, I provide a condensed discussion
                      of the mechanics involved with the LMBM            framework.","[25, 26]"

                      was accomplished with difficulty.        The out-of-control operation in the (c)
                      examples indicate that the event was accidental or unexpected.             While

                      of-control operations are not as revealing as those provided by Carlson, I expect

                     that has been subsumed under the label noun incorporation in the literature is
                     diverse and exhibits varying properties.        There has also been much debate on
                     how complex V+N predicates are formed, the debate essentially boiling down to
                     whether or not NI is a lexical or syntactic phenomenon.           There have been a
                     number of exchanges in the literature over the past two decades, beginning with
                     Mithun’s (1984) lexical analysis of NI followed by Sadock’s (1985) syntactic
                     account within an autolexical framework.          Baker (1988) gave further support to
                     the syntactic view suggesting a movement analysis from a Government and
                     Binding (Chomsky 1981, 1986) perspective.            This was followed by Rosen’s
                     (1989b) work in which she specifically argued against both the autolexical and
                     movement accounts.        Baker’s (1996) work within a Principles and Parameters
                     (Minimalist) framework (Chomsky 1993) advances his 1988 views to include a
                     syntactic explanation for why languages like Mohawk have syntactic NI, while
                     languages like English do not.
                             To best illustrate the varied use of the term noun incorporation, I provide a
                     brief overview below of Mithun 1984 and Baker 1996.","[410, 411]"

                     comparative work, also claims that lexical affixation evolved from compounding.
                     Carlson illustrates that compounding in Spokane is of the form VN or MN, and he
                     demonstrates that lexical affix constructions follow the same patterns.             He states
                     (p.81):
                               Regular use within words made roots lose their independence and
                               influenced a change in shape. Once formally separated, meanings of
                               related roots and affixes developed independently. Eventually the
                               distance was so great that the connection was not recoverable. Viewed
                               this way, lexical affixation is just the inevitable end point of the
                               compounding process.
                     Black (1996), also working on Spokane, draws parallels between the
                     phonological and morphological structures of free stem and bound stem
                     compounds.
                               Finally, Kinkade (1996b, 1998b) takes a diachronic look at possible links
                     between lexical suffixes and compounding.           While a number of problems are
                     raised in the paper, Kinkade concludes that lexical suffixes most likely did
                     originate from compounds.
                               A further piece of evidence that lexical suffix constructions evolved from
                     compounding can be put forward here based on data from Nxa?amxcin.                    As
                     discussed in section 8.2, one type of free stem compounding in Nxa?amxcin is
                     marked by the connector -af#-. This connector surfaces between two free stems
                     and loses the [t] segment in certain environments.          A compelling indication that
                     lexical suffix constructions developed from a#compounds comes from examples
                     involving two relatively new lexical suffixes:         =sqdxa? ‘domestic animal’ and
                      =spantk ‘year’.    It is reasonable to conclude that both of these lexical suffixes
                     are diachronically new to the language since they are the only two lexical
                     suffixes that still contain the s- nominalizer and neither of them have the
                     phonologically reduced form of other lexical suffixes.15

                      It is clear that the above predicates are intransitive because both are marked
                      imperfective by the prefix s-/sc- and the suffix -mix. These affixes are restricted to
                      intransitive predicates only.
                              Inchoative stems can also be transitive, as shown in the following

                      Example (263) contains a stem marked both inchoative and causative, while the
                      predicate in (264) is marked both inchoative and applicative.            I have no examples
                      involving external possession.      This is most likely a gap in the data.35
                              Nxa?amxcin makes use of inchoative aspect to indicate a change in state.
                      This aspectual property is usually transparent in the English translations by the
                      phrase “get V-ed’ or ‘go A’, as shown in the following examples:

                              34This example appears to be marked imperfective by the prefix s-, which
                      is typically restricted to intransitives. One would expect the prefix c- to surface
                     here instead.
                              35Kinkade (1989b:118) states that “(t)here are generally few restrictions
                     on what can co-occur with ‘inchoative’, and it is found with a large variety of
                     lexical, derivational, and inflectional affixes”. One exception, he notes, is stative
                     -t which appears only with inchoatives marked augmentative or plural.
                     Inchoatives not marked augmentative or plural cannot cooccur with -t.","[207, 208]"
