"11.1.3.3    Yes-no interrogatives
‘Yes-no’ interrogatives “seek a comment on the degree of truth of the questioned
proposition” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:178). Examples of Duna yes-no interrog-
atives are shown in (1026) - (1029), in which the interrogative marker =pe occur
on an otherwise declarative sentences. In Duna yes-no interrogatives typically have
a ‘positive bias’ effect, that is, anticipate a ‘yes’ answer that confirms the proposi-
tion. This is in contrast to alternative interrogatives (§11.1.3.4) which are typically
‘unbiased’.",[445]
"11.1.3     Interrogative and speculative
11.1.3.1    Introduction
Sadock and Zwicky distinguish the interrogative sentence type generally as that
which “signal[s] the desire of the speaker to gain information from the addressee”
(1985:156). I define Duna interrogative sentences as those that contain an interrog-
ative word (§3.9)4 and/or the interrogative marker =pe (§11.1.3.2). They are derived
from declarative or optative sentences; in this section I exemplify interrogatives that
are derived from declarative sentences only, including three basic structures: yes-no
interrogatives (§11.1.3.3), alternative interrogatives (§11.1.3.4), and question word
interrogatives (§11.1.3.5).
    Interrogative sentences typically function as questions. In prototypical question
situations the speaker: does not know something (or does not know it for sure),
expects the addressee does know it, and asks the addressee to tell them this inform-
ation (or to confirm it). In some situations an interrogative sentence can be used
as a ‘rhetorical’ question, for which an answer is not expected. The speaker does
not ask the addressee to fill a gap in his or her knowledge, but may use an inter-
rogative to convey an attitude (for example, surprise, criticism) towards a situation,
and/or draw the addressee’s attention to something (see, for example, (222)-(224)
in §5.3.3.2).
   This section also describes a further minor sentence type, the ‘speculative’ (§11.1.3.6).
This type is defined on the basis of final predicate morphology, comprising those
   4
     A possible exception to this is where interrogative words appear to be used in construction with
other morphemes as indefinite pronominals (see example (360)). Too few examples exist in the data
to pursue this issue further.

sentences that are marked with the uncertainty maker -rape (§9.3.3.2), or the epi-
stemic particles =koae and =nokoae (§10.4.3). In these cases the marker =pe also
occurs, but is not really productively applied, as in the case of -rape it is represented
as a frozen component of the morpheme, and in the case of (no)koae is basically a
required element of independent use of these forms (unless an interrogative word
is present in the sentence). Speculative sentences are like interrogative sentences
in that the speaker expresses ignorance of the proposition, and encourages the ad-
dressee to have a look at what they know about it. However, unlike typical contexts
of interrogative sentences there is little expectation that the addressee knows the
answer and will be able to respond definitively.","[443, 444]"

Interrogatives in Duna that do not contain an interrogative pro-form are commonly
structured as ‘alternative’ interrogatives which “provide a list from which, the speaker
suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179). Two
(or more) alternative scenarios are presented in the sentence. =Pe indicates there
is a choice to be made between these scenarios, and is felicitously represented in
English translation as ‘or’. Examples (1030) - (1032) show interrogatives in which
two alternatives of differing polarity are suggested. In (1030) - (1032) the positive
iteration of the predicate is placed first, inflected and further marked with =pe. The
negative iteration that follows is derived with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3),
and is not marked with =pe. This is typical of ‘alternative polarity’ interrogatives
in Duna (see also Giles MSa:L5). An appropriate answer (as shown in the b lines
of (1031) and (1032)) usually repeats part of the original question.

functionally akin to ‘yes/no questions’ in that they ask, is something the case? How-
ever, the scenario of this something not being the case is made lexically explicit in
the utterance; these examples are thus similar to ‘disjunctive-negative’ structures
(König and Siemund 2007:297) that occur in languages such as Mandarin.
    Examples (1033) - (1035) show some further alternative interrogatives. These
do not offer two alternatives of differing polarity, but detail possible propositions
that ‘sketch’ (either more or less exhaustively) the semantic domain of the required
information. Answers are shown in the ‘b’ lines.(1033)    a. kei=pe,              ngoya?

tions. The form =pe is repeated as a semi-independent form in between the altern-
atives, functioning like a coordinating conjunction. This repeated semi-independent
use of =pe is common if the alternatives are contrasted but not really ‘parallel’ pro-
positions (that is, they differ according to several parameters, as in (1036)), or if
more than two alternatives are listed. See also (603) in §7.5.5.2.(1036)     oke, imanoa mbatia or say Kristian mbatia-ka, ha-me-ka                  ka

Interrogatives may alternatively be ‘question word’ interrogatives (Payne 1997) that
contain an interrogative pro-form (§3.9). The pro-form stands for information that is
missing from the speaker’s knowledge of the proposition, and which the addressee
is asked to supply (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:185). Some examples are shown in
(1037) - (1041). Interrogatives that contain pro-forms may be marked with =pe,
as in (1038) and (1039), or not, as in (1037), (1040), and (1041). I do not know
what factors motivate this alternation, but the presence of an interrogative pro-form
means the sentences are formally interrogative and inherently question-like in either
case.6(1037)     ko ai.

     König and Siemund (2007:300) note that, although the application of an interrogative particle
would seem to be superfluous in constituent (question-word) interrogatives, it was nevertheless the
case that in approximately half of the languages they sampled, interrogative particles could option-
ally be added to constituent interrogatives.

         ‘Is that one Ambu, or who?’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).2)11.1.3.6    Speculative sentences
Speculative sentences are those that are marked with -rape (UNC, §9.3.3.2), =koae
or =nokoae (HYP, §10.4.3). Speculative sentences are like interrogatives in that they
are always either include (a reflex of) the interrogative marker =pe and/or include an
interrogative pronoun. However, the interrogative marker is not really productively
applied. Removing pe (or replacing the interrogative pronoun with a noun) does
not result in a corresponding declarative or optative sentence. A speaker typically
uses speculative sentences as an invitation to an addressee to assess a proposition,
without necessarily expecting the addressee to be able to resolve the speaker’s ig-
norance or uncertainty concerning it. An example is shown in (1043).(1043)      a. Speaker A: Lepani Mospi ngo=koae=pe. Lepani hundi-ranua.

ture of alternative interrogatives.

         do not know.’ (T/PK:020104)11.1.4    Imperative and optative
The imperative sentence type generally “indicates the speaker’s desire to influence
future events” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:160) and the optative represents “an ex-
pression of the speaker’s wishes” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:164). I define imperat-
ive sentences in Duna as those headed by a predicate that is inflected as imperative
(§8.2.4.1), and optative sentences as those headed by a predicate that is inflected
as desiderative7 (§8.2.2.4), prohibitive (§8.2.4.2) or hortative (§8.2.4.3). Examples
of imperative and optative sentences are shown in the sections in Chapter 8 that
introduce the relevant morphemes.
    Imperative and optative sentences in Duna share a formal feature that unlike
(most) declaratives they cannot be marked with -na (SPEC) or =nia (ASSERT). Both
sentence types are typically directive in function, being used as requests or com-
mands to get other people to do (or not do) something. They are two distinct sen-
tence types in that optative sentences can be recast as interrogative sentences,8 but
imperatives cannot. Interrogatives formed from optative sentences typically func-
tion as a request for guidance from the addressee concerning the undertaking of a
predicate activity, and are exemplified in §11.2.4.2.
    There remain two TAM markers that, on a semantic and functional basis, are
included here as belonging to the larger notional imperative/optative group: the
‘warning against’ marker -wayeni (§8.2.4.4) and the ‘suggestion’ construction with
kone (§8.2.4.5). At present it is not possible to identify these as comprising distinct
types within the imperative/optative group or otherwise, but from a functional per-
spective sentences that are marked with these forms are directive, and thus more
like imperative and optative sentences than they are like any other kind of sentence.
I have found no examples of them being used in interrogative sentences, or being
marked with =nia or -na, and these possibilities have not been tested.
   7
      That is, when it occurs utterance finally as the only, and terminal, inflection, not when it is
followed by further ancillary morphology (§10.2.2.3) or is part of a complement structure.
    8
      I was first alerted to this possibility by Giles (MSa:L9).
11.1. Overview of sentence types                                                                 421
11.1.5    Assumptive
Assumptive sentences include those with predicates that are marked with certain in-
formation status markers: the shared standpoint morpheme -ra (§9.3.3.1), dramatic
markers (§9.3.3.3), and the provocative inflections (§9.3.4). I call sentences that
are marked with these morphemes ‘assumptive’ because they signal an assumption
the speaker is making concerning the addressee’s state of mind, and express the
speaker’s ‘take’ on the addressee’s epistemic relationship to this proposition.9 For
example, use of the expective marker (§9.3.4.2) signals a speaker’s assumption that
the addressee has failed to consider the situation denoted by the proposition.
    The illocutionary force of an assumptive sentence is complex. They function
somewhat like statements, in that they present the proposition as information that
is known to the speaker. However, each morpheme has further particular functional
characteristics. For example, the expective marker is typically used in obliquely
advising the addressee concerning a course of action, which relates to the function
of directive speech acts. The potential observation marker is typically used in trying
to extract information from the addressee, which relates to the function of questions.
    In keeping with this inherent functional multiplicity, the way certain assumptive
sentences fit in with an overall formal classification of sentence types is problematic.
As can be noted from Table 11.1, assumptive sentences are basically defined neg-
atively as those that do not show features typical of other identified sentence types.
They are grouped together as a collection of misfits that share some formal, func-
tional, and semantic commonalities, but it is not clear that they represent a unified
category of their own, and in some cases there is evidence to support classification
as belonging to another major sentence type.
    For example, the shared viewpoint marker -ra marks a proposition as somehow
familiar to both speaker and hearer. Such utterances are not typically informative,
as the speaker intimates that the addressee already has a pretty good idea of what
he or she is talking about, but they are assertive, and in this respect are similar to
declarative sentences. The shared viewpoint marker also appears to have a formal
property that is typical of declarative markers, the ability to be marked with the SPEC
marker -na. However, it is difficult to assess whether -ra shares the core property of
declarative markers, which is the ability to occur in interrogative sentences.
    The marker -ra does not occur productively with =pe in interrogative sentences,
but this combination is represented in the fused form -rape that occurs in speculative
sentences (§11.1.3.6), so there is not really a clear answer to this question. Further,
   9
     This is not to say that the use of other sentence types does not also involve making assumptions
about the addressee’s state of mind: this is a fairly essential tenet of talking to other people. How-
ever, assumptive sentences necessarily signify something quite particular about the nature of this
assumption, which is not generally the case for other sentence types.
422                                      Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
it is possible to use -ra in a question word interrogative that is not a real question,
but more of a (musing) attempt to recover once known but subsequently forgotten
information. For example, PK explained that the constructed sentence (1046) is
the sort of thing one might say to oneself having momentarily forgotten Kipu’s
destination, and that sentence (1047) would be used if the speaker had forgotten the
date of the addressee’s mother’s arrival and was asking to be reminded of it.","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451]"
"11.1.3.2    Question marker =pe
The question marker =pe follows a final predicate in an utterance that is non-
assertive and typically elicits information from an addressee, that is, has a question
function. The question marker may occur on verbal clauses as in (1023), and on
non-verbal clauses as in (1024). These are examples of a question word interrogat-
ive and a yes-no interrogative, respectively.",[444]

“making announcements, stating conclusions, making claims, relating stories, and
so on” (1985:160). The declarative sentence type is most typically associated with
utterances that are statements, having propositional content that the speaker com-
municates to the addressee.
    As shown in Table 11.2, final predicate markers that I define as occurring in
declarative sentences1 include: TAM markers as described in §8.2.2.1 to 8.2.2.3,
§8.2.3 and §8.3; evidential markers (§9.2); the individual standpoint marker -pa;
specificity marker -na; and the epistemic particles =pi and =pakapi. Most of the
examples shown in the sections that introduce the relevant morphemes are declar-
ative sentences. Sentences headed by non-verbal predicates (either unmarked or
marked with one of the morphemes listed) are also declaratives.
    It is a core property of Duna declarative sentences that they can be derived as
interrogatives, for example, through the addition of the interrogative marker =pe;
sentences which typically function to communicate substantive content can be trans-
formed into sentences that seek (part of) the same content from somebody else.
    A further typical (but not universal) property of predicate morphemes that occur
in declarative sentences is that in situations of emphasis they are compatible with
either the SPEC marker -na (§10.2.2, §10.2.4) or the assertion marker =nia. This is
true of all of the relevant TAM markers, the personal evidential markers, and the
relevant epistemic particles.211.1.2.1     Assertion marker =nia
The bound form =nia (ASSERT) occurs finally on declarative sentences and marks
an utterance as an assertion.
   Examples (1016) and (1017) show the assertion marker occurring on non-verbal
predicates.(1016)     no ima=nia.
           1SG woman=ASSERT
         ‘I am a woman.’ (T/YS:270205)
   1
      Note that with regard to complex predicate morphology, it is the last morpheme in the sequence
that is relevant to this definition.
    2
      In the case of the individual standpoint marker -pa the situation in regard to this feature is not
clear (§10.2.4.4). Concerning the quasi-inflectional occurrence of the SPEC marker on independent
verbal clauses (§9.3.2.2), such verb forms are not further marked with =nia, and the question of
whether they are ‘compatible with SPEC’ is problematic; this would amount to asking if a morpheme
can be applied twice, something which has not been observed as allowable in any other area of the
grammar. Finally, the impersonal evidentials: these forms have something of a semantic/functional
incompatibility with either -na or =nia. The SPEC marker implies that the predicate refers to a highly
specific and individuated occasion, which clashes somewhat with the generalised and unanchored
perception denoted by the personal evidentials. Similarly, the assertion marker =nia basically marks
the speaker as an epistemic authority, and this is also at odds with the non-specific perceiver evoked
by the impersonal markers.

including the perfective, intentive, prophetic, habitual, abilitative and promissive
TAM markers. It does not occur following evidential or information status markers,
or on the stative or imperfective inflections.3(1018) ta ha-na               ruka-tia-ni,                no na-riya-ya-nda=nia.

     The distribution of =nia on final verbs is thus nearly complementary with that of the specificity
marker -na. The nature of this distribution suggests the emergence (or subsidence) of a grammat-
icised realis/irrealis mood opposition in declarative sentences whereby emphatic assertion is indic-
ated with -na in the realis category and =nia in the irrealis category.

stemic authority in regard to the proposition. The marker is not strictly obligatory,
but there are certain circumstances in which it is expected. For example, in elicited
or constructed answers to questions (in which the predicate was inflected with a
compatible morpheme), speakers consistently judged that a sentence sounded bet-
ter with =nia than without.","[439, 440, 441, 442, 443]"

"9.3.3     Past time events
9.3.3.1    Recent past, shared standpoint
The bound form -ra (SHRD) occurs as a verbal inflection on predications that repres-
ent very recent activities, and indicates that the speaker assesses the proposition as
representing collective knowledge that is shared by both speaker and hearer.48 The
  47
      This kind of firsthand/non-firsthand semantic split is not uncommon in evidential systems of the
world (see Aikhenvald 2004; Johansen and Utas 2000), and there is some indication that it is the
way the (relatively) nearby Angal system operates in the denotation of present time events (Madden
MS, Reithofer pers. comm.).
   48
      As for the individual standpoint marker -pa (§9.3.2.1), -ra occurs very rarely as a final inflection
in monologic narrative text, and my analysis of this form is provisional. Looking on the bright side,
the low frequency of the ‘standpoint’ markers -pa and -ra in narrative data is itself interesting, as
it contrasts markedly with the distribution of most other verbal inflections. TAM inflections and
evidential markers are readily deployed in narrative to index features of the narrative-internal world,
350                                Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
predicated activity is typically something that the speaker and hearer did and/or
witnessed in each other’s company, and/or something they have conversed about,
each having contributed to the other’s understanding of the event. This morpheme
is similar to the ‘referential’ marker in Pole (Engan Family), as described by Rule
(1977).
     The shared standpoint marker -ra is added to the o-base of consonantal verbs
(including the semi-irregular verb ra- ‘sit’), the i-base of wa-class verbs, and the
i-base or a-base of partial wa-class verbs. Giles (MSa) describes -ra as the ‘perfect’
or ‘general perfect’ past tense.
     Some examples of -ra are shown in (834) - (837). These illustrate that -ra
is commonly used in describing events that have just happened in the immediate
sphere of the speech situation. The predicated activity is something that the speaker
assumes has already been introduced into the ‘knowledge store’ (Vallduvı́ 1992) of
the speaker and hearer, either through the fact of it happening, or through reference
to it in conversation, or both. KK suggested that the sentence shown in (835) would
be suitable as a response if Person A had just thrown something over to Person B
and then asked them if they had caught it. In (836) ra occurs following the negative
circumfix na- -ya (§8.3).(834)    ayu ho-ra.

         ‘That man is deaf and didn’t hear.’ (Giles MSa:L27)    Example (837) is from a conversation in which the speaker and I were taking
turns looking through binoculars. The speaker was using the binoculars and I asked
her something about what she could see. She was surprised at my question, as I had
just had a turn a few moments previously; her response is something of a rebuke.(837)    ko ke-ra.
         2SG see-SHRD
         ‘You just looked!’ (LC)
either through the adoption of a main character’s viewpoint, or within reported speech (that may
or may not be overtly marked as such). This difference in distribution suggests that as inflectional
forms the standpoint markers are very closely tied to the actual speech situation and the identities of
speaker and hearer, and that this reference is not readily transferable to the narrated world.
9.3. Information status markers                                                              351
    The current data suggest that -ra is not generally used on final clauses in refer-
ence to events that happened anything more than a couple of days before the time of
utterance. Example (838) shows a sentence for which marking with -ra was judged
unacceptable, referring to an event of more than a year ago.49(838)    * alala no ho-nga          ko-ra-ngi,             Hirandareke mali

         dance-DEP be/stand-SHRD
         When I was first here, [they] danced a mali at Hirandareke. (CED/VIII:95)     The question and answer pairs (839) and (840) illustrate that -ra is only suitable
if the predicated activity is to some extent already established as something that the
speaker and hearer know about. An answer to a fairly open question such as that
shown at (ko aki pope?) ‘what did you do?’ is likely to introduce an event that
the questioner does not know about, in which case it cannot be marked with -ra.
PK stated that a sentence such as (839b) would be unacceptable to answer (839a).
Example (839c), in which the verb is inflected as perfective, would be the suitable
response. However, PK suggested that (840b) would be a good response in the event
that Person A had previously asked Person B to plant some corn seeds, and seeing
them later in the day finds out from them whether they have in fact done so (see
§9.3.3.2 concerning the form -rape in this example).(839)     a. A: ko sirakura aki po=pe.

              ‘Yes, I planted your corn seeds.’ (ED/VIII:134)
  49
     This example also shows -ra SHRD occurring as part of an adverbial clause marked by -ngi
‘TIME’ (§6.4.4.2). This morpheme attaches to nominal or demonstrative roots, and in this construc-
tion -ra is employed with demonstrative function. Note also that in this function the form is not
restricted to marking recent events.
352                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
    As we have seen in §6.2, -ra SHRD can also function as a demonstrative in
nominal and place phrases, in which case it is followed by an NP or PlP marker, and
used in denoting items that are known to the speaker and addressee(s) because they
have already been referred to in the discourse and/or experienced by both parties in
the real world.
    Example (841) shows a use of -ra that is unusual in the textual data. Having
just voiced the words used by a character in a story in a directly reported speech
construction, the storyteller marks the complement-taking verb ruwa- ‘say’ with the
shared standpoint marker. In this case, the storyteller appears to treat the utterance
of the story character as something that is not only part of a world that is shared by
the story-internal interlocutors, but also that which is known to the audience through
his enactment of it. This somewhat resembles the discourse demonstrative use of
epistemic demonstrative forms.(841)     ima-na-ka          ri-ya,    yawi ndu-ka khã-ya ka-yanua,                    anoa-na

The uncertainty marker -rape (UNC) signifies that the factual status of a proposition
is not known by the speaker, and that he or she does not identify anyone else in
particular as having knowledge concerning it.50
    The marker -rape typically occurs as an ancillary form, following an inflected
verb (Chapter 10). However, there are a few instances in the data where it appears
to have primary inflectional function and occurs on an otherwise uninflected verb
root, so I define it as an information status marker rather than an epistemic particle
(§10.4). When the uncertainty marker -rape occurs as a primary inflection, it marks
a speculation concerning a past event, indicating that the speaker thinks the pre-
dicated activity may have occurred prior to the time of speaking. The uncertainty
marker occurs on the o-base form of consonantal verbs and the i-base form of wa-
class verbs. Examples are shown in (842) - (844).","[378, 379, 380, 381]"

The potential observation marker is used as a verbal inflection in describing events
that the speaker is sure (or fairly sure) have happened, and thinks the addressee
could have seen. With regular verbs the form -noko is added to the root. For con-
sonantal verbs the form -noako is added to the o-base, and for wa-class verbs -naoko
is added to the u-base.
    Two examples of the potential observation evidential are shown in (858) and
(859). These exchanges are structured around a hypothetical scenario in which
Speaker B has been to the market. The point at issue is Speaker A’s take on this
event. The context surrounding (858) is that Speaker A has asked B if they went
to the market, and B has said they did, in company with another person (Manari).
Speaker A find this surprising, as she saw Manari but did not see Speaker B. Speaker
B asserts that nevertheless they were there in plain view:(858)     a. A: ko no na-ke-ya,        Manari no ke-o.

she went, it’s quite possible that Speaker A saw her.(859)     a. A: no ke-ya-roko         ko ngutia.

this example later with PK, he explained this utterance as, ‘Kipu saw me, and she
is asking you, did you see me too or not?’. He further elaborated that an appropri-
ate response to Kipu’s utterance in this case would have been the perfective visual
previous form of the verb ‘come’, as shown in (861), that is, confirming that I had
indeed seen Petros that day.

made explicit with a direct question, as in (862). Visual experience of the addressee
can also be obliquely invoked through a subsequent question that is marked with
a visual evidential, as in (863). (See §11.2.2.1 concerning the ‘viewpoint shift’ of

"11.2.2.1     ‘Viewpoint shift’ and evidential markers
As outlined in §9.2, evidential markers (excluding the impersonal forms) entail a
specific ‘perceiver’, the conscious entity that is understood to observe the evidence
in question. In declarative sentences, this perceiver is typically understood to be the
speaker. In interrogative sentences, this relationship shifts so that the perceiver is
typically understood to be the addressee; in asking a question, the speaker anticip-
ates the kind of evidence the addressee will use in supplying an answer.16
    This is illustrated in examples (1049) - (1052), in which the predicate rakare
‘cold’ is marked for current sensory evidence with the morpheme -yarua (§9.2.4.2).17
Examples (1049) and (1050) are declarative. The person who senses coldness or
heat (either of themselves or of a third person entity) is the speaker. Examples
(1051) and (1052) are interrogative, marked with =pe (§11.1.3.2). The person who
  16
      In the textual data, it is rare for interrogatives to be marked for evidence, and most of the
interrogative examples in this section are elicited or constructed. The people I worked with had no
trouble interpreting or supplying ‘evidential questions’, but these are functionally and pragmatically
marked forms in that they reflect a narrow expectation the speaker has as to the way an addressee
knows about something; situations in which this form of presumption is appropriate may be quite
limited. Although the typical function of a question is to seek information, evidential questions
covertly assert (or at least suggest) something about the addressee’s mode of engagement with the
event that is being discussed. Presumably, this can itself has implications as to the responsibility the
addressee has for a predicate activity, or the veracity and reliability of their knowledge of it (see for
example (1061)). I do not address these issues explicitly in this preliminary study, but they are clearly
significant to a deeper understanding of ‘evidentials in action’. Another issue that requires further
examination in regard to viewpoint shift is whether or not this is a consistent feature of interrogatives
that are inflected with notional evidential markers (§9.2.6). There are too few examples in the current
data to be certain on this point.

is typically coidentified with the informant.(1049) no rakare-yarua.

        ‘The boy is cold {you feel}?’ (CD/VIII:70)    Example (1053) illustrates the fact that, like evidentials, the opinion marker =pi
(§10.4.2) also exhibits viewpoint shift, as in interrogatives this marker switches to
ask for the addressee’s opinion, rather than marking a stated opinion of the speaker.(1053) epo=pi=pe.
         raw=OPIN=Q
        ‘Is [the fish you are eating] not cooked enough {you opine}?’ (LC/VIII:95)    Impersonal evidentials do not work in the same way as personal evidentials in
regard to viewpoint shift, and are appropriate to rhetorical questions or speculations,
rather than questions that expect an authoritative answer. Examples of impersonal
evidentials occurring in interrogative sentences are quite rare in the current data.
Unlike personal evidentials, impersonal forms do not entail a particular perceiver,
and so are not very suitable for situations where the addressee is identified as having
particular (and possibly exclusive) knowledge of the predicated event, as shown by
the awkwardness of (1054).(1054) *ko roro-yanua=pe
         2SG hot-SNS . IMPL=Q
        You are hot {it can be felt}? (CD/XIV:7)   The formally interrogative sentences in (1055) and (1056) are used in situations
where the speaker encourages the addressee(s) to partake in co-assessment of the
proposition, without an expectation that he or she necessarily knows more than the
speaker. Both parties have access to the evidence in question.

construction and it is not attested in my data, so further investigation is needed to
determine whether it is currently viable.19
10.3     Non-verbal predicates
As outlined in §10.1, some information status and evidential markers can mark non-
verbal clauses, for example those that are headed by a noun or time-stable adjective
(§4.1.1). This is an ancillary use of the forms, because they are not functioning as
part of the obligatory verbal inflectional system.
    Examples (951) and (952) show the uncertainty marker -rape following non-
verbal predicates. This marker indicates that the factual status of the proposition is
uncertain; it does not contribute any past time meaning (as it does when occurring
as a verbal inflection, §9.3.3.2).","[417, 418]"
"11.2.3.4     ‘Impossible proposition’ interrogatives
Hale (1980) says that in rhetorical questions in Newar, conjunct and disjunct verb
forms follow the declarative rather than typical interrogative distributional pattern.
This is seen in (1115a), in which an addressee subject occurs with a disjunct verb
form, and (1115b), in which a speaker subject occurs with a conjunct verb form,
despite the fact that these examples are interrogative (as indicated by the marker
la). These sentences are not ‘true questions’ because they are not genuine requests
for information; rather, the speaker asserts that the proposition is not the case.(1115)      a. cha ana wala                lā?
               you there come.DISJUNCT INTER .
              ‘Did you come?’ (i.e., most certainly not!)
           b. ji ana wanā              lā?
              I there went.CONJUNCT INTER .
              ‘Did I go there?’ (i.e., I most certainly did not!) (NEWAR: Hale (1980),
              gloss added)    Duna appears to function similarly to Newar, disrupting the usual distributional
pattern of the intentive and prophetic inflections in interrogatives for rhetorical ef-
fect. Interrogatives formed in this way express strong doubt (yes-no interrogatives),
and/or suggest that there is no possible candidate to fill the ‘missing participant’ slot
(question word interrogatives). That is, the proposition is implied to be impossible.
For example, the (constructed) interrogative (1116) combines an addressee subject
with the prophetic inflection. My Duna consultant Timon Kangapu thought that
this could only be used in a situation where there speaker wished to imply that the

    The issue of ‘privileged access’ with relation to Newar conjunct verb forms is discussed in
Hargreaves (2005).
11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity                     445
addressee would certainly not be able to go; for example, as an implied threat when
the addressee is planning to leave home in order to avoid legal action brought by the
speaker. Example (1117) shows a rhetorical interrogative with a speaker subject.(1116) ko Mospi nga-na=pe.
           2SG PLN      go-PROPH=Q
        ‘You’re going to Moresby??!’ (i.e., you certainly aren’t!) (CD/XIV:85)(1117) ngoya pa-na            wa-nda=pe.

        ‘Where will I go?’ (i.e., there is nowhere) (P/AM:NH0312A)    As seen in the preceding section, interrogatives with third person and questioned
subjects do not conform to the typical conjunct/disjunct distributional pattern. Rhet-
orical interrogatives are not formally distinguished as they are with speaker and ad-
dressee subjects, but are interpreted as such from context. Example (1118) is taken
from a text in which the speaker describes how she, her siblings, and her mother
were abandoned by her father and lived without the support of adult male relatives;
there is no man to butcher their pigs.(1118) ayu ita ha-tia anoa ai-ka           paka-nda=pe ha-me        ri-ya...

        (T/KP:061103)11.2.3.5    Further comments on intentive declaratives
My data include some examples of declarative sentences in which the intentive in-
flection does not reflect typical distribution with respect to subject identity, that is,
it occurs with non-speaker subjects. Some of these are reproduced and discussed in
this section.
    One situation in which it may be appropriate for the intentive inflection to occur
in a declarative with a non-speaker subject is in the description of a situation that is
desired by the speaker, as in (1119) and (1120).(1119) inu      hapia aru       ka-na-ra-me               ayu memba

         (RA translated this constructed sentence as shown, commenting that it could be
         used in a situation where the speaker has to choose somebody to send as a messen-
         ger.)    Some other examples suggest that a speaker can use the intentive inflection to
reflect the fact that they are an authoritative informant by virtue of a close asso-
ciation with a third person subject. This is illustrated by the constructed example
shown in (1121). Line (1121a) shows the typical declarative pattern of third person
subject and a predicate that is inflected as prophetic. On being asked whether the
intentive inflection (1121b) might also be suitable, PK reflected that it could be used
“if you live with those people” whereas (1121a) would be used “if you haven’t seen
them”.(1121)     a. anita =khunu yapenengi pi         itupanengi pi   Mospi nga-na.
              gang =3PL         Tuesday    LNK Wednesday LNK PLN       go-PROPH
            ‘They will go to Moresby on Tuesday or Wednesday.’ (I haven’t been

             gang =3PL         Tuesday    LNK Wednesday LNK PLN       go-INT
             ‘They will go to Moresby on Tuesday or Wednesday.’ (I live with these
             people) (CD/III:60)    Similarly, example (1122) shows a fragment of conversation (between myself
and two others) about whether or not a toddler would eat some food that I had
prepared. The toddler’s mother, Speaker B, replies to my question (1122a) using the
intentive inflection in (1122b). The other person, no relation to the child, repeats
the substance of the mother’s answer using the prophetic inflection as shown in
(1122c). I speculate that this reflects an understanding that the mother can ‘speak
for’ the child, whereas the other person does not claim this right. However, more
evidence is needed to test this hypothesis.(1122)     a. LSR: na-nda=pe, na-na-ya-nda.

             ‘[He] will eat.’

                    eat-PROPH=ASSERT give.IMP
             ‘[He] will eat, give [it].’ (LC/VIII:33)   The use of the intentive inflection in examples such as (1121b) and (1122b) can
additionally be interpreted as relayed utterance, in which the speaker reproduces the
11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity                    447
speech or intention of a close associate with an assumed rather than overt ‘report’
frame.2811.2.3.6       Summary
Overall, the intentive inflection implies that an informant personally experiences an
event as an unrealised plan and is closely associated with the described situation.
Having a plan of something presupposes control (the informant is a volitional sub-
ject argument), desire (the informant wants the event to happen) and authority (the
informant has best access to knowledge of it). These features typically (and in some
cases necessarily) coincide, but may each be sufficient to independently motivate in-
tentive marking in some circumstances. It is most usual (and always grammatical)
for intentive marking to occur in declaratives with volitional speaker subjects and
interrogatives with volitional addressee subjects.
    The prophetic inflection alternatively draws attention to the actual manifesta-
tion of the event as something that will be perceivable in the future, and implies
disassociation from the described situation. The informant does not exert conscious
control over the event, and does not assert a relationship with the people involved.
This shows similarities to the disassociative implications of evidentials as described
in §11.2.2.6. It is most usual for prophetic marking to occur with third person sub-
jects in declaratives, but it may also occur (without rhetorical effect) with addressee
subjects in declaratives and speaker and third person subjects in interrogatives.","[473, 474, 475, 476]"
"8.3.3    Negation with neya
An alternative negating form to the negative circumfix is the lexical negator neya
(‘NOT’).35 The lexical negator is not a verbal inflection, and functions like a complement-
taking predicate rather than a bound inflectional form. I include a brief description
of neya here because it is functionally related to the negative circumfix, and to aid
understanding of example sentences in which it occurs.36
    Unlike the negative circumfix, neya can occur as a negator in non-verbal clauses
expressing equation or proper inclusion, and can occur independently as a com-
plete utterance. As intimated by (Giles MSa:L5, L22), neya has features of a verbal
predicate, for example, it occurs in clause-final position and can take verbal inflec-
tions. It is unlike ordinary verbs in that it does not REQUIRE inflection and does not
subcategorise for NP arguments.
  35
      The sequence [nj3@] is also used as a negator. As it does not appear to differ from neya in
either meaning or distribution, and as there are obvious phonetic similarities, I assume that this is a
contracted form.
   36
      It seems likely that neya is also historically related to the negative circumfix. For example, one
possibility is that the lexical negator derives from an (unknown) verb negated with na- -ya, which
coalesced as a new word neya.
8.3. The negative circumfix                                                               303
    In a simple verbal clause negated with neya the final verb occurs in its root form
(regular verbs), imperfective stem form (consonantal verbs) or i-base form (wa-class
verbs). The verb ra- ‘be/sit’ occurs in its o-base form rao-.
    Neya can occur clause-finally without any predicate morphology, as in (729) -
(731).(729)   no waki neya.

ively.(734)   antia khane       -ra-tia     pi, ame-khane            -ra-tia   pi   ruwa ngi

304             Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
   Neya can negate non-verbal clauses, describing the absence of a relationship of
proper inclusion or equation between two noun phrases, as in (737) and (738).(737)      ho-na       nane kete neya.
           here-SPEC boy little NOT
           ‘This one was not a little boy.’ (T/JS:KG05V5.40)(738)      ha-na        Ambo neya=nia.
           there-SPEC PSN       NOT= ASSERT
           ‘That one surely isn’t Ambo.’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).1)    Neya can also constitute an entire utterance. In my conversational experience
‘yes-no’ and ‘alternative’ interrogatives (§11.1.3) are most commonly answered
with the verb of the clause (negated for a ‘no’ answer and inflected appropriately
for a ‘yes’ answer), but may also be answered with ẽ ‘yes/I agree’ and neya ‘no/not
that’. Neya can also be used to negate a proposition more generally; see example
(542) in which the speaker refutes a command.
    In reported conversations in narratives it is quite common for neya to be spoken
once or twice at the beginning of a response to a question word interrogative, as
exemplified in (739). I do not know what factors determine appropriate use of
neya in this situation or how its meaning should be defined, beyond saying that it
functions as a kind of prelude to the answer.37 Perhaps this also assists in indicating
turn-taking when there is no overt marking of reported speech.(739)       a. Ogre: ka         ha-ra         peya-na        aki.

       The use of a ‘no’-like word to introduce utterance also occurs in Kalam (Pawley pers. comm.).
Chapter 9Evidential and information status
markers
9.1    Introduction
In this chapter I introduce the use on final verbs of two groups of bound forms that
I term ‘evidential markers’ and ‘information status markers’. These markers are
broadly concerned with the overt indication of a speaker’s assessment of a proposi-
tion in terms of the way it is known or may be known.
    Duna evidential markers (§9.2) comprise a set of systematically contrastive and
mutually exclusive bound forms that mark information source, “the way in which
information is acquired” (Aikhenvald 2004:3) as a primary meaning; for example,
encoding the fact that the speaker visually witnessed the activity described by the
verb on which they occur. Duna information status markers (§9.3) have meanings
that relate in some way to ‘information status’; that is, they typically indicate some-
thing about the kind of information (for example, shared, surprising, certain) that
the proposition represents. Information status markers are mutually exclusive (with
one exception, see §10.2.4.4), but do not form a coherent paradigmatic set. Certain
evidential markers can co-occur with certain information status markers on a single
predicate (see Chapter 10).
    I describe the evidential and information status markers, as well as the epistemic
particles treated in§10.4, as formally encoding the semantic domain of ‘epistemic
assessment’, that is, how the proposition is known and what kind of knowledge it
represents. Epistemic assessment is concerned with the treatment of propositions as
subjectively informed mental artefacts or intentions.
    It is important to note that under this broad definition, epistemic assessment is
not specifically concerned with a speaker’s evaluation as to the reliability of know-
ledge and/or the commitment to a proposition as being ‘true’. Thus, I do not see it as
a synonym or subcategory of epistemic modality (or Palmer’s ‘propositional modal-                                         305
306                                 Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
ity’), which is typically defined as having to do with the speaker’s commitment to or
judgment of a proposition as being factual, likely, uncertain, etc. (see, for example,
Frawley 1992; van der Auwera and Plungian 1998; Palmer 2001; De Haan 1999).
In the case of some bound forms (for example, the uncertainty marker, §9.3.3.2) the
factual status of a proposition is a fairly central aspect of their meaning and func-
tion. However, it is not necessary to identify the encoding of a truth-value judgment
as the single most important meaning and function of the Duna forms that I describe
in this and the following chapter.1
    As outlined in §8.1.1.1, most evidential markers and some information status
markers can occur as either primary inflections, or as ancillary markers. In this
chapter I describe their occurrence as primary inflections, that is as markers that
attach directly to a bare verb root, or a particular base form of a consonantal or
wa-class verb, with no intervening inflectional morphology.2 When an eviden-
   1
      Many other terms exist in the literature concerning concepts that are similar to epistemic as-
sessment. For example: Chafe’s (1986) broadly interpreted definition of ‘evidentiality’ as involving
“attitudes to knowledge” (1986:262); Lazard’s identification of the grammatical category of ‘me-
diativity’, concerning the expression of facts “through their [i.e., speakers’] acknowledgment of
the event” (1999:95); Weber’s (1986) ‘information perspective’, discussed in regard to Quecha val-
idational and evidential markers; and Mushin’s (2001) ‘epistemological stance’, defined as “the
speaker’s conceptualisation of information based on their construal of the nature and status of their
knowledge in the context of language use” (2001:81). I did not find an established term that was
entirely suitable to my description of Duna. For example, a problem with adopting Chafe’s broad
definition of ‘evidentiality’ is that it would cause some terminological confusion, as I use ‘eviden-
tiality’ in a (now more generally recognised) narrower sense, in reference to a particular group of
markers that encode information source as a primary meaning. Lazard’s ‘mediativity’ relates more
strictly to grammaticised rather than semantic categories, and in his discussion he is interested in dis-
tinguishing evidentiality from mediativity, which does not accord well with the Duna data. Weber’s
definition of ‘information perspective’ is tied quite specifically to Quechua morphology, and is not
easily transferred to another context. Mushin’s ‘epistmological stance’ is too multi-layered to be
articulated as a primary category in this preliminary descriptive work, which is most concerned
with identifying the meanings of individual morphemes, their relationships to each other, and their
formal and functional contexts of use. This thesis thus describes some of the linguistic resources
that a speaker has available for the expression of epistemological stance, including morphemes that
encode epistemic assessment.
    2
      Given the potential ancillary function of evidential and some information status markers
(Chapter 10), there is justification for analysing the consonantal or wa-class verb form to which
some evidential or information status markers attach as a productively inflected perfective stem,
rather than a predictably selected o-base (or u-base) form that does not independently contribute
aspectual meaning to the predication.
   For example, the information status marker -ra ‘SHRD’ attaches to the o-base of consonantal
verbs. The meaning of ‘SHRD’ is entirely compatible with perfective aspect, as it marks completed
past-time events. Thus, the form ngora, composed of the consonantal verb nga- ‘go’ and -ra ‘SHRD’
can be analysed in two ways. Under one analysis, -ra is an ancillary marker in a complex inflection,
being added to a verb that is inflected: ngo-ra is ‘go.PFV-SHRD’. Under another analysis, -ra is
a primary inflection that attaches to a predictable base form of consonantal verbs: ngo-ra is ‘go-
SHRD ’. I adopt the latter (‘primary inflection’) analysis when a certain (conventionalised) condition
is met. When an evidential or information status marker attaches to the o-base of a consonantal
verb to produce the same time, aspect, and epistemic assessment features as when it (or its formal
equivalent) attaches to a regular verb root or the i-base of a wa-class verb (and/or when the i-base
and u-base of a wa-class verb vary with no change in meaning) I do not treat this as a productively

tial marker or information status marker occurs in a primary inflectional capacity,
it determines temporal features of the predicated activity in relation to the time
of utterance, indicating for example that the two are contemporaneous. As such,
these markers occupy the same formal slot and to some extent the same semantic-
functional domain of the TAM markers described in the previous chapter. Like
most TAM markers, evidential and information status markers do not grammaticise
‘tense’ as such, but supply an absolute time value as a derivative of other features;
for example, the interpretation of a predicated event as belonging to past time may
be a consequence of the kind of evidence a speaker has for it (see for example
§9.2.5).","[331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"
"11.2.3.3    Interrogative distribution
In this section I describe the distribution of the intentive and prophetic inflections
in interrogative sentences with addressee, speaker, and third person subjects. This
distribution attests a conjunct/disjunct pattern with respect to speaker and addressee
subjects. However, this is not maintained with third person subjects as in this case
the two inflections are used contrastively, the intentive being the more usual form.
    The intentive inflection exhibits viewpoint shift (§11.2.2.1) between speaker and
addressee according to sentence type, whereas the prophetic inflection does not. In-
terrogative sentences inflected with -nda continue to locate a specific current per-
ceiver, now identified as the addressee (instead of the speaker as in declaratives).
Interrogative sentences inflected with -na continue to evoke collective future per-
ception; the addressee may be able to ‘comment on’ the situation, but they are not
appealed to as the single most relevant source of information.
   Interrogative sentences with an addressee subject are inflected as intentive as in
(1105) and (1106). The speaker assumes that the addressee has a plan of their own
442                                Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
future actions, and use of the intentive inflection reflects this. Using the prophetic
inflection in this situation is extremely marked and to my knowledge only occurs in
rhetorical interrogatives (§11.2.3.4).

          2SG eat-INT=Q
         ‘Will you eat?’ (LC)    The intentive inflection in interrogatives carries a strong implication of an ad-
dressee subject, as illustrated by the constructed example shown in (1107), in which
the missing argument is assumed to be a second person subject (compare to (1095)).(1107)    anoa na-nda=pe.
          man eat-INT=Q
         ‘Will [you] eat a man?’ (CD/2003)    Interrogative sentences with speaker subjects are usually marked as prophetic,
as in (1108) and (1109). Such questions are always somewhat functionally marked
as it is unusual for someone to make a genuine request for information regarding
their own actions (see also §11.2.3.4). As explained by Hale (1980:100) regarding
Newar, “the speaker cannot ask a true question about an action in which he portrays
himself as a voluntary instigator”. In (1108), a yes-no interrogative (§11.1.3.3), the
speaker queries a proposition over which she herself has little conscious control. In
(1109), a question word interrogative (§11.1.3.5), the speakers are trying to come
up with a way to solve a problem; they are not ‘voluntary instigators’ because they
don’t yet know what they’re going to do.(1108)    no hi-ta        nga-ya-roko    ukuraye haka waki-na=pe.

tentive and prophetic inflections does not match typical conjunct/disjunct subject
patterning, which would predict the prophetic inflection as the usual form (Table
11.3). Instead, the two forms are used contrastively. The intentive is the function-
ally unmarked inflection, exemplified in (1110) and (1111), and is also typical for
questioned subjects, as shown in (1112).

         who go-INT
        ‘Who will go?’ (ED/XIV:108)     Using the intentive inflection suggests that the addressee (as informant/perceiver)
has a plan (in the sense of a mental model) of the queried event, and is in a good
position to provide information about it. This is a good functional basis for asking
a question. The prophetic inflection can alternatively be used in third person sub-
ject interrogatives when the speaker does not assume that the addressee necessarily
knows more than they themselves do; the utterance is more ‘wondering’ than ‘ask-
ing’. Prophetic interrogatives are thus functionally similar to speculative sentences
(§11.1.3.6) and interrogatives with impersonal evidentials (1055 and 1056).
     The contrast between intentive and prophetic interrogatives with third person
subjects is illustrated in a comparison of (1113) and (1114). These examples show
two different ways of querying the destination of a third person who is about to
depart. RA suggested that (1113) would be used if the speaker has just seen the third
person pack up her belongings in the company of the addressee. The addressee then
comes over to the speaker who asks, ‘where will she go?’. The speaker anticipates
that the addressee is privy to specific information that the speaker does not have, as
it is likely the third person will have verbally explained or otherwise indicated to
the addressee where they are going. By contrast, the question shown in (1114) will
be used when the speaker and the addressee both observe the third person packing
her belongings, and neither party has better access than the other to knowledge of
the leaver’s destination.(1113) pa-na          nga-nda=pe.

         query-SPEC go-PROPH=Q
        ‘Where will [she] go?’ (I wonder) (CED/XIV)    The distribution of the intentive in interrogatives can be seen to correlate over-
all with the speaker’s judgment that the addressee (as the designated perceiver) has
444                                   Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
better access than themselves to information concerning the proposition and is the
natural informant over and above others.27 In interrogatives with an addressee sub-
ject, the addressee is normally in a position to be the most authoritative informant,
as the person most fit to provide information about someone’s future activities is
typically that person themselves. In this situation, the intentive inflection is pre-
ferred. In interrogatives with a speaker subject, the intentive is dispreferred, as it
is odd to designate someone else as having ‘best access’ to information concerning
oneself. In interrogatives with third person subjects, there is usually an expectation
that ‘the addressee knows best’ (otherwise, why ask them) and the intentive is the
functionally unmarked form. Use of the prophetic inflection alternatively reflects
the fact that the addressee is not assumed to hold exclusive information concerning
the proposition, but may, like the speaker, be in a position to speculate about it.","[470, 471, 472, 473]"

         * Will you eat? (CD/XIV:21)    The question marker may also occur as a phonologically free form, see (1036),
and can constitute an entire utterance. In the latter case, the interrogative marker
refers back to what has just been said, typically expressing the speaker’s interest in
and/or wonder at what the addressee is telling them.5
    König and Siemund (2007:294-5) comment that, where interrogative sentences
are derived from the application of an interrogative particle or clitic to a declarative
sentence, this marker is typically positioned sentence finally (especially in verb-final

languages). This is basically the case in Duna, albeit somewhat complicated by the
alternative interrogative pattern, in which the interrogative marker links alternate
propositions and is not necessarily reiterated sentence-finally.","[444, 445]"
"4.2.4.2     Fronting
An object or oblique may be fronted and occur first in the clause.26 Fronting typical-
ly indicates that a referring expression is pragmatically prominent and focussed in
some way. For example, the phrase may constitute information that fills a perceived
gap in the hearer’s knowledge; the fronted phrase is in ‘new’ (or ‘completive’) fo-
cus (Dik 1989:392). This is seen in examples (90) - (93) which show first a situ-
ation described in unmarked word order, and then three question and answer pairs
in which a missing participant is placed at the beginning of the answer sentence.
These sentences show fronting of an object NP (91), a PP headed by the instrument
postposition -ka ‘INSTR’ (92), and an NP marked with -ra ‘CNCL’ (93). PK judged
that these sentences would only be acceptable utterances as answers to the relevant
question.27 (90)     na       anda khou-ra            phuya ndu rowa-ka            so.

               2SG.CS what kill.PFV
               ‘What did you kill?’  24
      The definition of left dislocation is confined by some scholars (see e.g., Foley 2007:443) to
describing constructions that involve copying. Left movement (and typically also broken intonation)
that does not involve copying may be referred to as ‘topicalisation’. However I do not use the latter
term for this as I use the word ‘topical’ elsewhere in a somewhat different sense, and because it seems
appropriate to use a single term for both construction types in Duna as they function similarly.
   25
      Thus, my use of this term is broad, and does not refer specifically to situations in which the
constituent in question is is represented by a pronominal element (or zero anaphora) in the clause,
and by an NP in the right dislocated phrase.
   26
      This is of course only observable if a constituent that would be predicted to occur before the
fronted constituent is present in the clause. For example, an object that is the only NP in a clause
will be clause-initial but is not ‘fronted’.
   27
      In this ‘answer to a question’ situation, there is a preference for fronted participants to be overtly
marked as indefinite with the quantifier ndu (see also §5.2.3.3). For example, when I first suggested
the constituent arrangement shown in (92), I did not have ndu within the instrument-referent NP, and
this was corrected by PK who thought that the sentence sounded much better with ndu included.

tuted’ for another (Vallduvı́ 1992:71-2).28 In (94), the object NPs of a negative and
a positive clause are fronted and contrasted. The hypothetical context is that two
people are talking over who went to the market that day. (94) ko no na-ke-ya,              Manari no ke-o.

a set of parallel events, as in (95) and (96). In the examples the fronted NP is
underlined. Fronting maintains parallel structure across the clauses as the contrast
argument always occurs first, building up a set of items. (95) ndulu kone, ho-ra-me                   ra-ya,      ita yopo        ho-ra-me           yaki

         (T/YS:270205)
  28
     From the available data this kind of ‘contrastive’ fronting in Duna seems to correspond closely
to ‘parallel’ and ‘replacing’ contrastive focus within Dik’s (1989) typology. However, this is a
preliminary observation only as I do not know the full range of situations in which fronting may
occur in Duna.

Subjects, objects, possessors, and obliques may be left dislocated.29 In such con-
structions, it is typical for the left dislocated element to be something the speaker
assumes the hearer already knows about (but cannot otherwise identify), while the
remainder of the clause provides new information. A left dislocated constituent in
Duna thus corresponds to Foley’s (2007:404) definition of a topic, “the link which
ties the information communicated in this sentence with what has preceded”.30
    In (101) and (102),31 the left dislocated ‘links’ (shown in bold type) correspond
to things that have recently been introduced into the text. Morphological marking on
the left dislocated NP reflects the participant’s clause-internal semantic role and/or
  29
      In examples in the textual data, obliques are fronted with broken intonation, but are not copied.
I have not tested whether copying is possible for all kinds of oblique constituents.
   30
      Compare also Vallduvi’s ‘link’ elements in information structure that are necessarily sentence-
initial (1992:48), and “point toward the address in the hearer’s knowledge store under which the
information of the sentence must be entered” (1992:62).
   31
      In some instances letters are substituted for proper names because the names represent special-
ised knowledge and it is not appropriate for me to reproduce them.

     In (102c), the speaker reiterates more precisely the meaning of no ame as used in the previous
sentences; that is, that the relationship goes back several generations. This sentence is not spoken
fluently but broken by several pauses. The status of these units as either left dislocated material or
afterthought expansions, or a combination of both, is not clear to me.

   Example (104) shows an NP that is left dislocated when its referent is already

Beanstalk. The bean seed (mbatano eke) has been introduced into the narrative
previously and referred to several times when the main character (a boy) sees and
buys the bean at a market. It has not been referenced for six clauses which detail
the boy’s return home and his attempt to conceal his activities from his watchful
mother.(105)     kho ha      hoa-ta     ka-ta           mbatano eke-na    anda hane

activation builds on the fact that a participant is already known, that is, is a potential

"11.1     Overview of sentence types
11.1.1   Introduction
Sadock and Zwicky (1985:155) define the term ‘sentence type’ as referring to “a
coincidence of grammatical structure and conventional conversational use”. Defin-
itions of sentence types are based on a correlation between typical functions (for
example asking a question or making an assertion) and the contrasting structures
of utterances that achieve (or are intended to achieve) these functions. König and
Siemund (2007:277) remind us that the illocutionary force (function) of a partic-
ular utterance is something that is negotiated between speech act participants in a                                        409
410                                    Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
particular context, and cannot be precisely determined through reference to formal
properties only. However, structures that index sentence type do provide one kind of
signal of what the speaker wants the addressee to ‘do’ with the proposition encoded
in the utterance (cf. Weber 1986), for example, understand it as information that the
speaker has and is communicating to them (a statement), assess the proposition in
terms of his or her own knowledge and respond accordingly (a question), or bring
the denoted situation about (a directive).
    I define Duna sentences as being one of six types: declarative (§11.1.2), inter-
rogative, speculative, imperative, optative, or assumptive. Interrogatives are grouped
with speculatives (§11.1.3) and imperatives are grouped with optatives (§11.1.4), as
these sentence types have some formal and functional similarities and it is useful to
be able to discuss them together. The positive identification of assumptive sentences
as a unitary discrete type is somewhat problematic, and this is discussed in §11.1.5.
   Four diagnostics that are used in defining the six sentence types are:      i whether the sentence includes an interrogative word (§3.9) and/or the question marker
        =pe (§11.1.3.2). This is a feature of interrogative and speculative sentences.   ii whether the final marker on the predicate can be followed by either -na ‘SPEC’ or
        =nia ‘ASSERT’ (§11.1.2.1). This is a feature that is typically associated with declar-
        atives.   iii whether there is an assumption that the sentence has an addressee subject. This is a
        feature of optative and imperative sentences.   iv whether the sentence can be (notionally) reframed as a sensible ‘twin’ counterpart
        that has a different value with respect to being interrogative. For example, a declar-
        ative sentence can usually have the marker =pe attached to it, resulting in a corres-
        ponding interrogative sentence. This feature is characteristic of declarative, optative,
        and interrogative sentences.","[438, 439]"
"    The term pikono may also be applied to narratives that are spoken, rather than
sung, but detail similar (less lengthy and complex) imaginative stories of a long-ago
time, where a hero or heroine encounters ogres and spirits. Spoken pikono is typ-
ically identified as a female genre (bedtime stories for children), and sung pikono
as a male genre. My textual data includes three sung pikono texts (one recorded
by NH and two by KG), which I give a distinct designation as ‘P’. Other narratives
that are potentially identifiable as pikono but which are spoken rather than sung are
designated as ‘T’. On some occasions I use utterances of audience members pro-
duced during a sung performance; these are designated PAR for ‘pikono audience
response’.
    The textual data includes some material that was recorded in interview-like situ-
ations, with one Duna speaker questioning another on a certain topic. These are des-
ignated as ‘IV’. In some sections interviews are interpreted, in that KG or myself
asks a question in Tok Pisin, which is translated into Duna for the Duna interviewee
by the Duna interviewer, etc. Some other interviews are between a Duna speaker
and myself, so that the questions are asked (by me) in Tok Pisin and/or Duna, and
replies are made in Duna. I designate these as ‘LIV’ for ‘learner speaker inter-
view’.33
   After recording, the Duna text (T, P, IV, or LIV) would be transcribed by either
a Duna speaker, or myself in company with a Duna speaker (usually the latter). I
  33
     I do not use my own attempted Duna utterances in interviews as example sentences unless they
are necessary as additional context, in which case their status as learner speech is indicated.

would then work on a translation of text with a Duna speaker or speakers, keeping
a list of further questions at points of confusion for later referral to the original
speaker of the text and/or other speakers who we thought might be able to help in
regard to esoteric or otherwise difficult constructions and vocabulary.34 The people
that I worked with most consistently on transcription and translation tasks were
Kenny Kendoli, Petros Kilapa, and Kipu Piero, although others would chip in if
they happened to be around at the time. Generally, we would translate the text into
Tok Pisin, and this was our primary language of discussion, but in working with
KK and PK in particular we would often also use some English. For several of
the texts recorded in 2005, transcription and translation sessions were conducted in
collaboration with Kirsty Gillespie.
    A full list of textual data used as source material for this thesis, including a brief
description of content, is provided in Appendix 1. I encourage the reader to look
over this list, as it not only provides additional context for examples, but also gives
an idea of the kinds of things that happen in Duna stories and in Duna people’s lives.","[52, 53]"

8.1.1.2   Primary inflections and the final verb
Bound morphemes that can occur as primary inflections on final verbs are listed in
Tables 8.2 - 8.5. A short description is included that outlines the typical import of
each morpheme when it is used in a non-interrogative sentence (roughly, a directive
or statement) as a primary inflection, and is not further followed by an ancillary
form.
    The morphemes have been divided into separate tables according to the kind of
reference situation that they are typically used in. These divisions do not map ex-
actly to the way that the morphemes are presented in this and the following chapter,
as the overall organisation of these chapters follows the TAM vs evidential vs in-
formation status marker distinction. Rather, the tables are provided here to give
an overview of the semantic range of markers that are in broad functional contrast
within parameters regarding the illocutionary force of the utterance, and the actual-
ity and time of the event in question. Some issues concerning how these parameters
build functional paradigms of verbal inflection in Duna that cut across different
formal classes of morphemes are discussed at various points in this and the follow-
ing chapter.
    Tables 8.2 - 8.5 show those forms that are typically used as primary inflections
in statements, where a speaker tries to communicate the proposition of the utter-
ance as something that can be treated as ‘information’. These are further divided
according to the relative time and actuality of the event in question, being classified
270           Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
as generally referring to past (Table 8.2), present/habitual2 (Table 8.3), or poten-
tial time (Table 8.4). Table 8.5 shows those morphemes that are typically used in
directive utterances where the speaker tries to get other people to perform (or not
perform) the denoted action.
     The inflections shown in Table 8.2 and Table 8.3 are drawn from the TAM
marker, evidential marker, and information status marker groups (shown in the table
in that order, divided by horizontal lines). Inflections that relate to potential time are
all TAM markers except for one information status marker, included in the bottom
row. Directive inflections are all classified as TAM markers.","[298, 299]"
"9.3.2.3    Overview of the expression of present time events
We have now looked at the full range of known Duna morphemes that can occur as
primary inflections on final verbs in the expression of (non-habitual) present time
events, first introduced in Table 8.3 and reproduced here as Table 9.6.46 The group
includes three TAM forms (one of which is applicable to wa-class and consonantal
verbs only), four visual and non-visual sensory evidential markers, the individual
standpoint information status marker -pa, and specificity marker -na (the last two
being applicable only to regular verbs). The morphemes are formally and semantic-
ally disparate, but also functionally contrastive, and can be though of as providing
a speaker with a finite set of choices in regard to the (maximally simple) expression
of a situation that holds at the time of utterance.
  45
      For example, in detailing the functions of nominalising morphology in Bodic languages (a pos-
tulated genetic grouping within Tibeto-Burman), Noonan (2008) notes that: “when nominalizations
[i.e., constructions headed by nominalisations or forms morpholgically identical to them] appear as
main clauses, the typical effect is one of mirativity, i.e. the sense that the predication so expressed
is in some sense surprising, contrary to expectation, or in some way exasperating”. In discussing
Kiranti languages (Tibeto-Burman), Bickel (1999) argues that the use of nominalisation markers on
non-embedded clauses represents a focus construction. Such constructions may be used in Belhare,
for example: “to instantiate a controversial discourse variable” (for example, in an utterance that
emphatically rejects a suggestion or insinuation made by an interlocutor); in the instantiation of an
open variable (completive focus) where “a speaker claims her proposition to be the definite answer
to the question”; or to re-instantiate a variable in narrative in order to “ascertain that the audience is
fully aware of the proposition and does not doubt it any further” (Bickel 1999).
   46
      The special present form of nga- ‘go’ (ngui) is not included in the array, as it is only applicable
to one verb. However, in relation to later discussion in this section, the fact that this inflection only
occurs in sentences with volitional informant subjects means there is a good argument to be made
that it encodes participatory semantics.

    Figure 9.1 shows one way that these forms can be arranged as a system of in-
flectional options, albeit one that draws its components from diverse sources (des-
ignations in parentheses are explained and discussed subsequently).
    As a first choice, a verb that denotes a present-time event can be inflected with a
form that makes reference to unseen information source (a SNS category evidential
marker) or one that does not. If a SNS marker is selected, a further distinction
between personal and impersonal evidence (§9.2.2.2) is possible. Otherwise, further
selection is made between other TAM, evidential, and information status markers.
    If the event described is a state, this can be expressed as something that was
visually witnessed prior to the time of utterance, in which case the choice between
personal and impersonal evidence is again brought into play. Otherwise, the stative
TAM marker can be used (§8.2.3.1). If the event is non-stative, it becomes import-
ant to identify the class of the verb that denotes this event. If the verb is regular, it
may be marked as representing individual knowledge (§9.3.2.1), or as expressing a
situation that is specific and noteworthy. Typically this is something that the speaker
thinks can or should be immediately observed by the interlocutor (§9.3.2.2). Altern-
atively, if the verb is a member of the consonantal or wa-class verbs, it is simply
marked as denoting an imperfective event through use of the imperfective stem
(§8.2.2.2).

    In addressing the status of the ‘other’ designations within Figure 9.1, the pos-
sibility of treating information source as an obligatorily expressed domain in verbal
inflection becomes relevant, as discussed with respect to past time events in §9.2.9.
The choice between SNS markers and other forms can be expressed as a selec-
tion between two kinds of information source: that which is ‘firsthand’, compris-
ing visuo-perceptive, participatory, and factual information source; and that which
is ‘non-firsthand’, comprising non-visuo-perception, and being extended to certain
kinds of inference concerning ongoing events (as illustrated in (769) in §9.2.4.2).47
Under the ‘stative’ node the distinction can again be characterised as one that is
entirely to do with information source, ‘visual’ versus ‘participatory/factual’.
    Under this reading, inflectional options that relate to present-time situations
comprise a functional paradigm within which evidentiality is an obligatory gram-
matical category: a speaker has a finite set of morphological options, all of which
encode information source. As for the perfective inflection, whether or not TAM
markers such as a the stative and imperfective inflections do indeed encode inform-
ation source is something of a moot point, and further data are needed to examine
this issue. There is some evidence to support the view that these forms are ‘pos-
itively’ evidential (for example, the fact that they can, like evidential markers, be
followed by -na SPEC, see §10.2) and some evidence against it (for example, the
fact that IPFV can occur in combination with evidential markers, and that the stative
inflection can be followed by epistemic particles).
    Regardless of whether or not these forms are identified as necessarily evidential
morphemes, it can be seen that the parameter of information source (like that of
aspect as outlined in §8.2.3.7) has quite a profound effect concerning the possible
articulation of possible primary inflections as a system or group of subsystems, and
is a particularly important factor within the inflectional inventory.","[375, 376, 377, 378]"
"    The potential observation marker sounds odd as an answer to a question in un-
marked circumstances (864), because it effectively points out that the questioner is

"11.2.4.2     Prohibitive, hortative, and desiderative
The prohibitive, hortative, and desiderative morphemes occur as final inflections in
optative sentences (§11.1.4), exemplified in §8.2.2.4 and §8.2.4. These inflections
also occur in interrogatives that function as requests for permission or queries as to
what it would be best to do. Typically, the speaker asks the addressee whether he
or she supports an activity that the speaker intends to carry out. This is exemplified
in (1126) and (1127a) (with the hortative inflection) and (1128) and (1129) (with
the prohibitive inflection).29 An assent to a hortative imperative request is typic-
ally couched as an imperative (§8.2.4.1) as shown in (1127b). The prohibitive and

         ‘May I see?’ (SD/III:60)
  29
     Giles suggests that these two constructions maintain the immediate/deferred contrast as for dir-
ective utterances (§8.2.4.6), the hortative being an immediate request for permission and the pro-
hibitive a deferred request (that is, for something that the speaker would like to do later rather than
straight away). This seems a sensible analysis and is not contradicted by the 2003-7 data, but I have
no contrastive examples that clearly confirm it.

         ‘May I not cut your pandanus?’ (ED/VII:14)    In (1126) - (1129) the subject is the speaker. This contrasts with non-interrogative
use of these inflections, in which the subject is the addressee (in the case of the pro-
hibitive) and typically the speaker + the addressee (in the case of the hortative). The
hortative/interrogative can also be used in suggestions regarding group activities, as
in (1130).(1130) hina piriri koro-wae=pe.
          food all    steambake-HORT=Q
         ‘Shall [we] cook all the food?’ (ED/V:102)    There are also a few examples in the data of the desiderative marker -no oc-
curring in an (question word) interrogative utterance, in which case the subject is
the speaker, as shown in (1131) and (1132). This does not appear to be a common
construction, and all but one of the recorded examples come from a rather special
situation, a mourning song where the singer (Kipu Piero) directly addresses the
deceased, a close female friend (see Gillespie 2007b:Chapter 4).(1131) no pa-ka           nga-no=pe.

         ‘Who is there as a friend that I may go to (now that you, my dearest friend,
         are dead)?’ (Gillespie 2007b:261, gloss added)    Of these three inflections, the prohibitive and desiderative can be identified as
bearing some relationship to disjunct distribution, as there is a predictable alterna-
tion between a non-speaker subject (in optative sentences) and a speaker subject (in
450                               Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
interrogative sentences). For the hortative, the situation is muddied; the hortative
typically has an inclusive speaker + addressee subject in optative sentences and a
speaker subject in interrogative sentences, but these are not the only options (see,
for example, (706)). However, the fact that there is ‘something going on’ in rela-
tion to a non-speaker/speaker subject switch in all cases suggests that someone who
supplies (or is asked to supply) deontic attitudinal rather than propositional inform-
ation is included as a kind of informant. As with the evidential markers (§11.2.2)
and the prophetic inflection (§11.2.3), the prohibitive, hortative and desiderative
morphemes, broadly speaking, imply a non-informant subject.

11.3     Epistemic assessment and the final predicate: an overview
In this thesis I have described a range of bound forms that express epistemic as-
sessment meanings, including evidential markers, information status markers, and
epistemic particles. These are used by a speaker in indicating how they and others
are positioned in relation to the propositional content of an utterance as knowledge.
They frame the utterance with respect to such questions as: does it represent know-
ledge that was gained through a particular kind of perceptual experience? Is the
proposition a state or event that other people can independently observe and know?
    In this concluding section I summarise certain formal, semantic, and functional
characteristics of these forms, consider the issue of whether these groups should be
gathered together as members of a superordinate formal-functional category, and
comment on the nature of epistemic assessment as an obligatory or optional com-
ponent of final predicate morphology.
    Bound evidential markers (§9.2) target ‘information source’ as their primary
semantic domain. Evidential markers do not co-occur and can be arranged as a
paradigmatic set that encodes a set of contrasts with respect to three parameters:
the evidence category (one of four possibilities derived from the features ‘seen’
and ‘direct’), personal vs impersonal evidence and current vs previous evidence.
The forms of the morphemes typically show some relationship to each other, for
example, the sequence nua recurs in the impersonal evidential forms for each cat-
egory (and does not occur as a component of other inflectional forms). Evidential
markers can typically function as both primary inflectional and ancillary forms.30
    Information status markers (§9.3) indicate features that relate to the incor-
poration of information into the presumed ‘knowledge store(s)’ of the discourse
participants speaker and addressee. They are typically used by a speaker to advise
an addressee on how they should treat the proposition encoded in the utterance, for
example as something that is familiar to them or as something that is particularly
noteworthy. Information status markers do not represent a category of formally
equivalent morphemes, although they are functionally comparable. They all oc-
cur as primary verbal inflections and some may also function as ancillary markers.
Some information status markers can occur in combination with some evidential
markers.
   Epistemic particles (§10.4) indicate features that are relevant to the semantic
domains of information source and/or information status, for example, that a pro-
position is a reasoned judgment of the speaker, or is something hypothetical that
cannot be directly verified. Epistemic particles do not occur as verbal inflections,
  30
     Note however that, excepting for the sensory category marker, impersonal evidentials are not
attested as ancillary markers.

"  12
     That is, I do not discuss inflections such as the imperative -pa (§8.2.4.1) which is clearly pre-
dictive of an addressee subject but occurs only in imperative sentences and has no corresponding
interrogative realisation.

              ‘Did you go there?’ (NEWAR: Hale (1980), gloss added)    Hale further explains that Newar conjunct forms are only used if the subject ar-
gument is also a “true instigator, one responsible for an intentional act” (1980:96).
For example, if a speaker does something accidentally, or is the argument of a non-
volitional ‘impersonal’ predication such as ‘come to know’, the verb will be dis-
junct, not conjunct (1980:96). Curnow’s subsequent work on Awa Pit expanded
the definition of ‘conjunct/disjunct’ to incorporate the fact that some systems are
also sensitive to the identity of an undergoer argument (Curnow 2002). Curnow’s
definition of the terms is as follows:       A language contains a conjunct/disjunct system if, given an agentive, inten-
       tional, volitional context (or a relatively neutral context with a verb that is
       most commonly interpreted as an intentional, volitional action performed by
       an agentive subject), statements containing a first person are distinct from
       those that do not contain first person reference, while questions containing
       second person are distinct from those that do not contain first person reference.
       The marking used to distinguish first person in statements and second per-
       son in questions is the “conjunct”; the other form is the “disjunct”. (Curnow
       2002:614)As already outlined in §8.2.1, Bickel and Nichols (2007) discuss conjunct/disjunct
marking in relation to the indexing of a role they term ‘informant’ (after Bickel
2001). A functional definition of informant is “the person whom the speaker sup-
poses or claims to be the immediate supplier of the information” (Bickel and Nich-
ols 2007:223).13 Typically, this is the speaker in statements and the addressee in
questions. As part of an agreement system, conjunct forms index the informant, and
disjunct forms alternatively index “any participant who is not the informant in the
speech situation” (Bickel and Nichols 2007:223). This definition of the informant
  13
     Some issues concerning what is appropriately included as ‘the information’ are briefly con-
sidered in §11.2.4.2. For the time being, I focus on information as the propositional content of a
declarative sentence.
11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity                                    425
role is similar to the ‘epistemic authority’ or ‘epistemic source’ as defined by Har-
greaves (1991 2005) concerning Newar(i). In regard to Duna I use the term inform-
ant to refer to the speaker of a declarative sentence and addressee of an interrogative
sentence. That is, I use it as a label which is defined through reference to sentence
type, rather than through reference to what a speaker supposes or claims about par-
ticipants in the speech act situation. This supports discussion of knowledge-related
features that are typically vested in the informant person, but can be manipulated to
semantic or pragmatic effect (see, for example, §11.2.2.5).","[452, 453, 454]"

     It remains difficult to propose derivations for the evidential markers that work
well throughout the set and for all verb classes. For example, although replacing rua
with tia results in a change of temporal specification (from current to imperfective
previous) in the sensory evidentials (Table 10.5), this is not a consistent alternation
that is observable elsewhere: the forms rua and tia also contrast within the visual
category, but the meaning of this alternation (stative previous versus perfective pre-
vious) is different to that which is found in the sensory category markers, and in the
results and notional evidence categories there is no comparable alternation at all.
Additionally, there are complications concerning the fact that markers within the
same evidential category show irregularities. For example, the hypothetical devel-
opment of the results marker outlined in (1015) is perhaps plausible for consonantal
verbs, but not for regular or wa-class verbs, which receive the form rei (rather then
ri), and do not show any expression of perfective aspect on the verb stem, as rei
is directly attached to the uninflected verb root or the i-base form. The origin of
the regular/wa-class resultative inflection suggests a different derivation from that
of consonantal verbs.29
     Overall, the forms of the evidential markers suggest that the paradigm as presen-
ted in Table 9.1 is developing piecemeal, put together from a collection of inflec-
tional and complex structures that are drawn into relationships of opposition (for
example, previous versus current time) that are reasonably constant throughout the
set. However, some of the oppositional relationships are aberrant, as forms that be-
long to the same evidential category may encode a distinction that is not sustained
throughout the paradigm, or skip one of the paradigmatic contrasts. For example, as
inflectional forms the visual category evidentials encode an aspectual distinction as
regards the predicate event, but do not express the previous/current contrast. This
  28
      Beyond noting that this is homophonous with the general predicating medial inflection -ya
‘DEP’, I am not able to suggest an original meaning for this form.
   29
      In the case of the regular forms, a likely source is an erstwhile serialisation construction (§7.3)
that indicated perfect aspect, in which a form of the existential verb era- ‘be/put’ occurred as Vlast ,
following a regular or wa-class verb. Recall that, although it is not attested as a final verb form
(being supplanted by the special stative form iri), ‘be/put’ has the i-base form (e)rei.
408                              Chapter 10. Ancillary final predicate morphology
kind of lopsidedness is perhaps partly what drives the incorporation of construc-
tions into the system as (quasi-)inflectional forms. Such a process would probably
be recursive, as incorporation may create a new semantic gap even as it fills another.
Chapter 11Final morphology and sentence type
In this chapter I explore the meanings and functions of certain bound morphemes
(TAM markers, evidential markers, information status markers, and epistemic particles)
with respect to the illocutionary type of the sentence in which they occur. In par-
ticular, I look at differences in meanings and extended implications of predicate
markers that are associated with interrogative as opposed to non-interrogative sen-
tences. The category of ‘interrogative’ is particularly significant to a discussion of
epistemic assessment (Chapters 9 and 10), because the typical speech act function
of an interrogative sentence is that of a question, and couching a proposition as a
question is expressive of certain ideas about knowledge and how it is differentially
distributed between speaker and addressee.
    Section 11.1 gives an overview of sentence types in Duna, and introduces two
further sentence-final bound forms that are associated with declarative and interrog-
ative sentences. In §11.2 I examine and exemplify particular features of predicate
morphology that shift according to whether a sentence is interrogative or not, fo-
cussing on the implications of certain final predicate markers as concerns subject
identity and volition. In §11.3 I provide an overview of issues concerning epistemic
assessment and the final predicate, drawing together material presented in this and
preceding chapters.","[436, 437, 438]"

9.2     Evidential markers
9.2.1    Introduction
In this section I introduce the evidential paradigm and the semantic parameters that
it encodes, and provide examples of the evidential markers3 as primary inflections
on final verbs in declarative sentences (that is, broadly speaking, as they are used
in statements rather than in questions). The set of evidential markers as they occur
on regular verbs is shown in Table 9.1. See §9.2.8 for a summary that includes the
forms of evidential markers on consonantal and wa-class verbs.
    I find it helpful to think of evidential markers as entailing a ‘perception event’4
in which a person (or other high animacy being) perceives the evidence in question
and/or becomes cognizant of the predicate activity. This is in accordance with Jo-
hansen’s (2000:61) definition of evidentials as presenting a situation “with reference
to its reception by a conscious subject”. An evidential marker in some sense ‘de-
scribes’ the kind of perception that is experienced (or thought to be experienceable,
see §9.2.7).inflected perfective verb stem to which an ancillary marker is applied. Rather I interpret the use of the
o-base or u-base as a fossilised reflex of an erstwhile complex inflection that does not independently
contribute a ‘PFV’ specification (see also §10.5.4). So, the fact that the information status marker -ra
occurs on bare regular verb roots and the i-base form of wa-class verbs in the same semantic contexts
in which it occurs on the o-base of consonantal verbs means that I gloss the ngo in ngora as ‘go’, not
‘go.PFV’. The actual situation probably lies somewhere in between the two possible analyses. That
is, the selection of the o-base (or u-base) form is meaningful but is part of a conventionalised rather
than productively compositional morphological operation.
     3
       Giles (MSa) describes all of the bound forms I present in this section (with the exception of
those described in §9.2.4.4 and §9.2.7) as part of an overarching paradigm of verbal inflection for
which tense (past, present, future) is construed as the major contrastive parameter. Our conclusions
as to the semantic parameters that are contrastively encoded by evidential markers are thus different,
as are our ideas about how the markers fit into an overall system of verbal morphology. However,
my approach to investigating the meanings of these morphemes was substantially informed by her
earlier work.
     4
       This follows on from Kockelman’s (2004) discussion of evidential markers as disambiguating a
‘source event’ from a speech event.

        (NTN)     At least three aspects of the perception event are relevant to the contrasts ex-
pressed within the evidential paradigm. These include the nature of the information
source (‘evidence’), whether the perceiver is a specific individual or is unspecified
(‘personal’ versus ‘impersonal’), and whether the perception event is contemporan-
eous with or precedes the time of utterance (‘current’ versus ‘previous’). Time is
only specified if the evidence is ‘personal’ rather than ‘impersonal’. Section 9.2.2
briefly outlines the contrastive values of these three parameters. In §9.2.3 - §9.2.6
I illustrate the semantic scope of the evidential categories as they are expressed in
the personal evidential markers, and §9.2.7 provides examples and discussion of
impersonal evidentials.
    When they occur with inflectional function, evidential markers contribute aspect-
like and/or tense-like temporal features to the predicate. Aspect-like features (for
example, stative, perfective) tend to be positively specified by the morphemes,
and tense-like features (present time, past time) provided by a combination of the
nature of the evidence type and the temporal specification of the evidence (§9.2.2.3).
Evidential markers also contribute implicational meaning that concerns the identity
and/or volition of the subject argument of the clause. In particular, they do not typ-
ically occur in sentences where a volitional subject argument is also the informant;
that is, the speaker of a declarative sentence or addressee of an interrogative sen-
tence (§8.2.1). This (‘disjunct’-like) distributional pattern is mentioned on occasion
throughout the following sections and discussed in more detail in §11.2.2.
    Several of the evidential markers have a clear formal relationship to each other,
for example the sequence rua is found in four of the personal evidentials, and this
alternates with the sequence nua on impersonal evidentials. I provide some brief
comments on the forms (and possible historical development) of the markers in
§10.5.4.
9.2. Evidential markers                                                                        309
9.2.2     Contrasts within the evidential paradigm
This section outlines certain contrasts that are distinguished within the evidential
markers as a group.","[336, 337, 338]"
"    A further piece of evidence for the existence of a palatalised aspirated velar con-
sonant is found in the nominal root ‘fire-making kit’, which typically has the surface
form [kh jau]. If the glide that follows the consonant is derived from a vowel, the
underlying form would be /kh iau/, having the syllabic structure /CVVV/ that is oth-
erwise unattested in monomorphemic words. However, if the underlying structure
is rather /khj au/, the syllable structure would match a common /CVV/ template.21    I thus account for instances of contrast such as those shown in Table 2.34, the
presence of [CGV] surface forms in which V is [-low], and the existence of words
with non-standard syllabic structure by positing the existence of labialised and (re-
sidual) palatalised consonant phonemes. These consonants are posited as occuring
in a word-initial environment only. Word medially I interpret [CGV] surface forms
as being derived from /CVV/ sequences (or from conditioned palatalisation, etc.)
as there is no evidence of contrast and this conventional interpretation allows for
more consistent representation overall. However, my analysis only goes part-way
to providing an explanation of palatalised and labialised sounds within the Duna
phonological system. Questions remain concerning the distributional patterns of
these sounds in contrast to others, and their relationships (both synchronically and
diachronically) to other phonemes, sequences of phonemes, and motivated phono-
logical processes.",[82]
"
    As for inflectional use of the specificity marker, Duna speakers I worked with
typically stressed the importance of visual perception when discussing the appro-
priate use of -na as an ancillary form. For example, PK paraphrased the constructed
sentence (906) as ‘A man is coming, I am watching him.’(906)   anoa ndu heya-na.
        man one come.IPFV-SPEC
        ‘A man is coming.’ (CD/VIII:23)
376                                     Chapter 10. Ancillary final predicate morphology
   Examples (907) and (908a) are taken from stories. Using specificity marking
helps keeps the story lively as it marks the narrated action as being of the here-and-

inflected as imperfective, either through stem alternation or the individual stand-
point marker -pa (INDV), which provides a functional alternative to the conson-
antal imperfective stem form, and provides temporal rather than information status
meaning in this construction.5 The IPFV+NTN construction is typically used in de-
scribing an activity that is inferred to occur habitually (first noted by Giles MSa).6
This allows for expression of (semantically) inferential evidence beyond the narrow
confines of the results category evidential markers (§9.2.5), which are only used in
reference to perfective events.
    An example of IPFV +NTN is shown in (909). The (hypothetical) situation is that
the speaker has just observed a bird caught in a spider’s web. The speaker advances
a hypothesis that this happens regularly.
   4
      Note also that in (908a) the speaker moves seamlessly from being outside the character as a third
person narrator to being inside the character’s head, voicing his thoughts; another way of drawing a
listener into the story-world.
    5
      The wa-class verbs are attested in this construction both in their imperfective stem form, and
with -pa added (preceding -noi). I do not know what contrast (if any) this alternation encodes; it
may be indicative of a general trend of regularisation for wa-class verbs.
    6
      In his analysis of Foe, Rule (1977:74) describes two morphemes that are semantically and func-
tionally similar to the Duna ‘inference of habitual activity’ complex inflection, but he analyses these
as referring to ‘future tense’ rather than ‘habitual aspect’. This is also a plausible interpretation of
the Duna construction, as inferring that something ‘always happens’ strongly suggests an inference
that it will happen. However, in the Duna case a habitual interpretation seems more in keeping with
the available examples.

IPFV + visual or results evidential  There are a few examples in the textual data of
the visual completive evidential -tia being used in combination with an imperfective
consonantal verb, as shown in (913).(913)     nane ha      ngoya-tia.
          boy there go.IPFV-PFV.VIS . P
          ‘A boy is travelling there {we have seen}.’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).2)    It seems sensible to interpret (913) as an example of an ancillary (complex in-
flection) construction, indicating that an imperfective event has been visually ob-
served, prior to the time of utterance. The event is non-stative (and so cannot be
appropriately described using the visual evidential -rua as an inflectional form).
Although this structure is attested in the textual data, I found that some speakers did
not find it readily interpretable in declarative constructed sentences, so it does not
appear to be highly productive.
    One situation in which it appears more ‘natural’ to use IPFV + -tia is in yes-
no interrogatives (§11.1.3.3), as in (914). As is discussed in §11.2.2.2, the use of
evidential markers as final inflections in yes-no interrogatives is quite unusual; such
a construction effectively questions the addressee’s perception as much as the event
itself. This can imply doubt about the addressee’s veracity and the reliability of
his or her evidence, so that the interrogative functions as a challenging utterance;
see, for example, (1061). Using an evidential as an ancillary form in a yes-no
interrogative avoids this to some extent as it separates the event from the evidence.
The semi-finite imperfective verb identifies the queried event,8 and the ancillary
evidential suggests how the addressee could know about it.9(914)     ene kone       poranda heya-tia=pe.
          true INTENS cannibal come.IPFV-PFV.VIS . P=Q
          ‘The cannibal truly came {you saw}?’(P/AM:NH0312B)    Results evidentials may similarly occur in combination with consonantal imper-
fective stems in yes-no interrogatives, as in (916). KK suggested that this sentence
place but they have found it difficult. They don’t see the actual birds, they see the nests half done.
The two characters themselves see this, and the pikono teller reveals their thoughts.” In the final
sentence, Kenny is commenting on the fact that in narratives evidential categories commonly reflect
the viewpoint of major characters in the story, rather than the narrator.
    8
      A problematic fact for this analysis is that the inflected verb is imperfective, rather than perfect-
ive. For example, it seems that it would make more sense in (914) to use the perfective stem of the
verb, ho ‘come.PFV’, as the event that is being queried is (theoretically) completed, not ongoing. I
suggest that the suppletive visual forms of the consonantal verbs are originally derived from ho+tia
(etc.) and that it is no longer possible to ‘undo’ this morphological operation; in order to create a
contrast with the inflectional evidential the imperfective form must be used.
    9
      In Foe, evidential markers have distinct forms according to whether they are declarative or
interrogative (Rule 1977).

Perfective verb forms can be marked with the visual evidential marker -rua, sensory
evidential -yarua, and specificity marker -na.11 Generally, complex inflections that
involve a perfective stem are semantically analytic, with meanings that are com-
pletely predictable given the usual meanings of the individual forms.","[404, 405, 406, 407, 408]"
"1.3.3.4    Summary of data types
A key to the datatypes that are indicated in example sentences (and referred to else-
where in the thesis text) is shown in Table 1.3. Data type designations are shown in
parentheses following the translation of an example, preceding further information
that indexes the particular source text. For example, when ‘(P/AM:NH03T12A)’
follows the English translation, the initial ‘P’ shows that this example is taken from
a sung pikono text. The following two letters represent the speaker, and ‘NH’ shows
that this text was recorded in audio form by Nicole Haley. The remainder of the des-
ignation details the year and tape of Haley’s recording.
    In certain cases, data represents a combination of types. For example, there are
some texts that start off as straightforward ‘T’ narratives, but shift into the ‘Learner
Interview’ category as I start to ask questions of the speaker about their story. Some
sentences in the notebook data may be a mix of constructed and elicited material,
for example in situations where I have constructed the first half of a sentence and
asked a speaker to finish it off. Where I judge that two designations are equally
  35
      My level of competence in spoken Duna is quite basic. During my time in the Duna-speaking
community I grew to be able to: engage in simple, highly contextualised, conversation; follow more
extended monologues that were presented slowly in a step-by-step and/or repetitive way for my
benefit; communicate more detailed stories and explanations (depending on the forbearance of my
interlocutors); and follow overheard comments, requests and responses where my comprehension
was significantly assisted by the interactional setting and/or prior knowledge.
   36
      In most cases the context and provenance of these sentences is not indicated. In many cases
content suggests that an example is reproduced from (or at least inspired by) natural conversational
language. In other cases the sentence appears to have been extracted from a sermon or biblical story,
or simply to have been constructed to illustrate or test a point of grammar.

336                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
9.2.9    The perfective TAM marker revisitedAs can be seen in Table 9.4, the majority of evidential markers are used as primary
inflections in declarative (or interrogative) sentences that describe past time events.
In this respect, they are in contrast with the perfective TAM inflection described
in §8.2.2.1. This raises the question of whether the perfective inflection, like the
morphemes to which it is opposed, itself encodes an information source value; is it
really just marking a temporal feature, or does it also say something in particular
about evidence?
    Two additional information source types that are of particular relevance to this
issue are the ‘participatory’ (also termed ‘performative’) and ‘factual’, because
these are the kinds of evidence that the perfective might reasonably encode.31 Par-
ticipatory information source relates to situations in which the speaker is actively
involved in the event described, and knows of it as a participant.32 Factual inform-
ation source relates to “actions or states which have been observed enough by the
speaker for him to generalize them as true and [...] which are simply common
knowledge” (Oswalt 1986:36).
    The construal of factual and participatory semantics as a distinct category or
categories within an evidential system is a feature of languages such as Kashaya
(Oswalt 1986) and Central Pomo (Mithun 1999) of the Pomo family, northern Cali-
fornia, and, closer to home, Oksapmin (Loughnane 2007; forthcoming) and Foe
(Rule 1977). In Central Pomo for example, one of a set of seven enclitics is nor-
mally added to an inflected verb to indicate information source. Categories distin-
guished in this evidential system include ‘general knowledge’ (factual) and ‘per-
sonal experience of one’s own action’ (participatory), as well as those that encode
more canonical information source types such as hearsay, inference, and auditory
evidence (Mithun 1999:181).
    In Foe and Oksapmin evidentiality is an obligatory verbal inflectional category
in at least some areas of the grammar (for example, indicative past tense forms). By
this, I mean that the encoding of information source can be identified as a requisite
component in the grammatical system: in certain kinds of sentences, a speaker must
choose not whether, but which kind of, evidence is specified. In Foe and Oksapmin,
verbal inflections that make reference to features such as visual or other sensory ob-
servation are formally contrasted with an inflection that makes reference to factual
and participatory meaning; participatory/factual semantics are grammaticised as an  31
      Aikhenvald (2004) and Willett (1988) do not generally recognise participatory or factual mean-
ing as being relevant to evidential systems cross-linguistically.
   32
      Compare Oswalt’s definition of the performative in Kashaya: “the speaker knows of what he
speaks because he is performing the action himself or has just performed it” (1986:34).
9.2. Evidential markers                                                                               337
evidential category.33
     The kinds of evidential systems outlined above thus suggest a particular ques-
tion concerning the Duna perfective inflection, namely, whether it is a semantic-
ally complex form that specifies both time and information source, and represents
a participatory and/or factual evidential category.34 If it were, this would allow an
analysis that evidentiality is an obligatorily marked category within a certain area of
Duna grammar (declarative sentences that denote past time events). However, while
it seems very likely that the perfective inflection at least implies participatory/factual
semantics as a consequence of contrast with other possible primary inflections, at
this stage there is insufficient evidence to claim that it actively encodes information
source and is itself an evidential marker.
    In languages in which participatory and/or factual evidential markers occur, they
are members of a closed set of mutually exclusive morphemes that have information
source as a primary meaning. That is, there are compelling categorical reasons, as
well as semantic and functional motivations, to treat the markers in question as
evidential.
    This is not so in the Duna case, as there are clear indications that while the per-
fective inflection contrasts with each evidential marker, it is not part of the same
formal set. As has already been mentioned, the perfective inflection has much more
restricted distribution than evidential markers, as it only occurs as a primary in-
flection on verbal predicates, whereas evidentials can occur as ancillary markers
with verbs (§10.2.3), and most can mark nominal predicates (§10.3). The evidential
markers as identified in §9.2 comprise a mutually exclusive set of forms that cannot
co-occur; however, many of them are attested occurring in combination with the per-
fective inflection (§10.2.2.5). Verbs that are inflected as perfective are commonly
further marked with epistemic particles (§10.4), whereas verbs that are inflected
with evidential markers typically are not, and in some cases are barred from doing
so (§10.4.2). A further significant point concerns the application of the assertion
  33
      In the Oksapmin case, as described by Loughnane (2007), the participatory/factual evidential
is zero-marked in some person/aspect categories, and is also the inflection that can be most widely
used in more complex morphological structures. For example, a preverbal particle that encodes
inference can be used with a verb that bears a participatory/factual inflection, in which case the
information source meaning of this inflection is bleached. Thus, the participatory/factual forms are
the functionally unmarked way of expressing past tense in the grammar. Nevertheless, as argued by
Loughnane (2007), in view of the paradigmatic formal opposition displayed and contexts in which
the independent inflection is appropriate, the most sensible interpretation is that verbal markers
comprise a distinct evidential category—the participatory/factual—in these languages.
   34
      One alternative analysis would be to posit a ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential marker. How-
ever this would not add anything to the present discussion, which is concerned with markers that can
occur as primary inflections. Such a morpheme would have to be defined as a marker that can only
occur in an ancillary capacity (Chapter 10), as it is not the case that a verb can occur as a final predic-
ate in (apparent) bare root form, inflected with the postulated ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential
only.
338                                 Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
marker =nia (§11.1.2.1), which marks certain kinds of declarative sentences. This
form is not applied to verbal clauses following evidential markers, but is commonly
added following the perfective inflection.
    Additionally, there are some problems with saying that the perfective TAM
inflection contrasts exclusively with evidential markers, because certain informa-
tion status markers are also available for use as primary inflections in describing
past time events (§9.3.3, §9.3.4.3). These morphemes are also (at least margin-
ally) present in the overall ‘past time’ group as contrastive forms (Table 8.2), and
this makes the proposal that the perfective inflection marks a specifically evidential
value less compelling.
    We must therefore look mainly at contexts of use to examine whether the per-
fective inflection encodes participatory/factual semantics, and at the current time it
is not clear that this is the case. Further analysis and data are required to investigate
a) the presence and strength of a correlation between use of the perfective inflection
and participatory/factual meaning; and b) whether any such meanings can be con-
vincingly distinguished from those that might arise through a situation of ‘default’
use, where the perfective inflection is an unspecified form that implies epistemic
assessment values by dint of contrast only, rather than positive specification.35
    In sum, I find that there is not a strong case for defining the perfective TAM
marker as a morpheme that actively encodes information source. However, because
most of the morphemes to which it is opposed specify particular kinds of non-
participatory information source, this inflection is likely to at least imply a speaker’s
involvement with the event that is so described, and/or their understanding of it as
  35
     For example, it is possible to make a general observation that verbs in the textual data which
denote events in which the speaker was personally involved as an active participant (for example, in
clauses with a speaker subject) are usually inflected as perfective (and are not followed by further
markers of epistemic assessment). However, this could just as easily be a consequence of the fact
that evidential markers are rarely appropriate to speaker subjects in statements (§11.2.2), rather than
reflecting the fact that the perfective inflection is inherently participatory in meaning.
   Similarly, while the perfective inflection is quite commonly used in those histories which can be
posited as representing as general ‘facts’ or common knowledge (for example, the narrative concern-
ing the origin of Lake Kopiago), there are also myriad examples in the textual data of the perfective
occurring as an independent inflection on sentences describing events that the speaker would not
claim to have been directly involved in, and would not claim to be general factual knowledge (for
example one-off ‘made up’ stories with imaginary characters). There are several competing conclu-
sions that could reasonably be drawn from such use. One is to say that the perfective inflection is
completely neutral in regard to epistemic assessment features and anybody can use it anytime about
anything, with no concomittant evidential or validational (etc.) effects. Another is to say that it does
specify a participatory/factual evidential value, but that this is construed from the point of view of
characters within the narrative, as other evidentials are. A further option is to say that the perfective
inflection, although not positively specified, typically implies factualness, participation, etc, but that
this can be construed within the larger frame of the narrative (cf. Lidz 2007). That is, it is not spe-
cifically encoding a personal viewpoint, but can be understood to be functionally unmarked in the
context of the story-world, rather than in the actual world. This latter interpretation seems the most
convincing to me.

9.3.1    Introduction
In this section I introduce a further group of bound forms, ‘information status mark-
ers’, that can occur in an inflectional capacity on final verbs in statements. The in-
formation status markers as applied to regular verbs are listed in Table 9.5. A sum-
mary of how these markers occur on consonantal and wa-class verbs is provided in
§9.2.8. Some of these forms can occur in combination with certain TAM markers
and/or evidential markers; see Chapter 10.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368]"

           + VIS      an ongoing dynamic event that the speaker has witnessed ‘mid-
                      stream’; used in questions where the speaker thinks the addressee
                      could have access to visual evidence

     Note that the expective marker -nako (§9.3.4.2) comes close to this, but additionally implies that
the addressee has ‘missed something’, so is not always apposite.

    Within the structures that I term complex final inflections, there is something
of a continuum between combinations of morphemes that appear to operate more
as unitary inflectional forms, and those that remain more semantically analytic. In
the first case, the meaning of the combined morphemes is quite specific, and cannot
be accurately predicted from its individual parts. In the second case, the construc-
tion is transparent, with a meaning that is productively ‘built’ from its components;
compare for example the ‘IPFV+NTN’ construction (§10.2.2.4), which is more more
unitary, with the ‘PFV+VIS . P’ construction (§10.2.2.5), which is more analytic.","[395, 396]"
"11.2.1.1     Conjunct/disjunct systems
The conjunct/disjunct ‘agreement’ pattern was first examined by Hale (1980) in his
analysis of Newar(i) verb forms, and the terms derive from his description. Under
Hale’s definition, ‘conjunct’ and ‘disjunct’ describe contrastive verbal inflections,
one of which (the conjunct) occurs in statements with speaker subject arguments
and in questions with addressee subject arguments, and one of which (the disjunct)
occurs in other situations. The basic alignment of a conjunct/disjunct subject agree-
ment pattern is shown in Table 11.3.",[452]
"            Table 11.3 Basic distributional pattern of conjunct and disjunct verb forms                                             Statement         Question

                          addressee          DISJUNCT        CONJUNCT
    Hale initially illustrates the contrastive Newar forms with the examples shown in
(1048). Example (1048a) shows the conjunct form of the verb ‘go’, wana, occurring
in a declarative sentence with a speaker subject. Examples (1048b) and (1048c)
show the disjunct form wana occurring in declaratives with an addressee and third
person subject, respectively. Example (1048d) shows the conjunct form occurring
with an addressee subject in an interrogative sentence.",[452]

           2SG mother when        come-SHRD
         ‘What day did your mum arrive again..?’ (CD/VIII:136)    The shared standpoint marker -ra thus groups with declarative markers in some
important ways, but not in others, because its semantics mean that it is not suitable
to typical questions.10
    The situation is similar for other ‘assumptive’ morphemes. The dramatic mark-
ers for example indicate that the proposition communicated represents information
that is surprising and exciting. Sentences marked with these forms are functionally
very similar to typical declarative sentences in that they are informative; indeed,
most of the time the whole point of these markers is that they mark a proposition
as new information, presupposing that the addressee will be startled to hear of it.
However, unlike typical declaratives they do not appear to be marked as definite
with -na or as asserted with =nia, and there is no evidence that they can occur in
interrogative sentences.11
  10
      This is somewhat akin to the situation with impersonal evidentials, which occur in interrogative
sentences that are speculative in function, rather than being clear requests for information that the
speaker does not have, and assumes the addressee knows; see (1055) and (1056).
   11
      I found that people did not typically recognise the dramatic morphemes as meaningful forms in
non-spontaneous contexts, and my attempts to pursue this issue through elicitation and constructed
sentences were unsuccessful. As regards the provocative inflections and interrogative possibilities,
data is also limited. Constructed sentences where these morphemes were followed by =pe were re-
jected as non-sensical. If we imagine that these inflections show a kind of viewpoint shift (§11.2.2.1),
that is, that the expected identity of an entailed perceiver shifts between speaker and addressee in
statements and questions, this rejection is understandable. For example, in non-interrogatives, the
potential observation marker identifies the addressee as a possible perceiver. In interrogatives, this
would (presumably) switch to the speaker as possible perceiver. However, it is difficult to readily
imagine a situation in which someone asks whether or how something has happened, while simultan-
eously making reference to the fact that they could have seen it happening. Similarly, a combination
of the expective marker and =pe would convey a meaning that could be paraphrased as something
like: ‘I (the speaker) am not paying attention to this event, and you (the addressee) think that I ought
to be paying attention to it’. However, the very fact that the speaker is asking a question about the
event denies the lack of attention that -nako suggests, so this is again hard to readily imagine as a
typical scenario.

11.2       Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity
11.2.1     Introduction
Duna does not exhibit verbal agreement in the typical sense of indexing the per-
son or number of predicate participants by means of contrastive inflectional mor-
phology. However, some final predicate morphemes show patterns of distribution
that clearly correlate with the identity of the subject argument. In this section I
describe and discuss correlations that differ according to whether the sentence is
interrogative or not12 and provide ‘standard implications’ (that is, evince a strong
likelihood) as to the identity of the subject along the lines of a ‘conjunct/disjunct’
system (§11.2.1.1). Subject identity is not the only predictive factor in the distri-
butional patterns, but supplies a framework by which to examine typical as well as
semantically and pragmatically marked occurrence of the relevant forms.","[451, 452]"

non-verbal clauses can also specify a time frame for the predication to some extent,
albeit indirectly (§10.3).",[126]

    TAM markers encode features of the predicated event in relation to time and
event modality. Time features include those that are related to the category of as-
pect (“the internal temporal constituency of a situation”, Comrie (1976:3)) and to
the category of tense (relating the time of the event with respect to the time of utter-
ance.6 ‘Event modality’ is defined by Palmer (2001:8) as the modal category which
refers to “events that are not actualised, events that have not taken place but are
merely potential”.7 Inflections that encode event modality meanings are concerned
in expressing an attitude towards the actualisation of a potential event; for example,
saying that it can or should (or shouldn’t) take place. Palmer divides event modal-
ity into two main types, the ‘dynamic’ and ‘deontic’. Dynamic mode is typically
concerned with ‘internal’ properties (generally properties of the subject) such as
ability and intention, and deontic mode is more to do with ‘external’ conditioning
factors such as obligation and permission (Palmer 2001:9). This distinction relates
somewhat to the division of ‘participant-internal modality’ and ‘participant-external
   6
      Some of the inflections have additional meanings and functions that are relevant to broader topic
of ‘epistemic assessment’, discussed in the following three chapters. These meanings are stated here,
but discussion of them is kept to a minimum until the relevant features have been presented in more
detail with regard to other predicate morphology.
    7
      Palmer contrasts event modality with propositional modality, which is to some extent the do-
main of the Duna bound morphemes described in Chapters 9 and 10.
278            Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
modality’ proposed by van der Auwera and Plungian (1998).8
    Semi-finite inflections (§8.2.2), comprise a set of four morphological operations,
two of which encode aspect values and two of which encode event modality values.
These can occur as the only inflection of an independent clause, or derive stems that
can be combined with ancillary predicate morphology, including evidential markers,
information status markers, and epistemic particles; see Chapter 10.9
    Sections 8.2.3 and 8.2.4 describe finite final verb inflections, those that derive
a bounded proposition in terms of actualisation, temporal features, and/or the il-
locutionary force of the utterance, marking “structural independence at the highest
possible level of sentencehood” (Bisang 2007:137). Section 8.2.3 details inflections
that occur in declarative (or, by extension, interrogative) sentences. Two of these
inflections, the habitual and stative, are used in reference to an actual situation, and
mark time features of these situations. The other three inflections are used in ref-
erence to non-actual events. These have quite specific or complex meanings, for
example the promissive inflection -wei indicates that the speaker makes a promise
or accepts an obligation regarding a future action. At least some finite declarat-
ive inflections can be used in limited combination with certain ancillary markers,
although this is uncommon (§10.2.3.3).
    In §8.2.4 I describe a group of final verb markers that occur in non-declarative
sentences (marking imperative, optative, and some other minor sentence types, see
§11.1). Some of these are not strictly inflectional forms as they are constructional, or
are added to derived verb stems rather than bare root forms; I include such markers
in this section on functional/semantic grounds. The markers described in §8.2.4
usually occur in directive speech acts (for example, commands, prohibitions) where
the speaker tries to get other people to do (or not do) things. The core meanings
of these forms are deontic, expressing “the imposition of an expressed world on
a reference world” (Frawley 1992:420).10 Time reference (immediate or deferred
time, see §8.2.4.6) is also either encoded or implied as part of their meaning. Finite
non-declarative TAM markers do not occur in combination with ancillary markers
   8
      The match is not exact. For one thing, the essential definition of modality in van der Auwera
and Plungian (1998) concerns the opposition of necessity and possibility; thus, participant-internal
modality has to do with internal possibility (for example, ability) or internal necessity (need), and
does not incorporate intention. Additionally, participant-external modality is treated as a domain
that contains deontic modality, rather than as a way to define it. However, van der Auwera and
Plungian’s and Palmer’s ‘deontic’ categories do end up being roughly equivalent, as under both
models the major concerns of deontic modality are obligation (deontic necessity) and permission
(deontic possibility).
    9
      I call these inflections semi-finite because they do not necessarily determine temporal and actu-
alisation features of the predicated event in absolute terms; if they are followed by an ancillary, their
meanings are typically construed as relative to the ancillary, rather than independently.
   10
      We can say that in contrast to this, markers that are typically used in statements are concerned
in the exposition of the reference world as an expressed world.
8.2. Tense, aspect and event modality (TAM)                                              279
and are thus ‘terminal’ inflections.
    TAM markers can be grouped together in a number of alternative ways which
cut across the three groups as presented in §8.2.2 - §8.2.4. Different semantic, func-
tional, and formal features of the morphemes compel different articulations of how
they relate to each other. For example, it makes sense to identify TAM markers
that are used in the description of actualised rather than potential events as a dis-
crete group that encodes aspect as the primary organisational parameter, and this is
outlined in §8.2.3.7.
    Duna verbs are not marked with pronominal agreement affixes,11 and TAM
markers do not mark person as such (that is, they do not alternate strictly according
to the number and person of certain clausal arguments). However, certain (declarat-
ive) TAM markers have a distributional pattern that correlates with subject identity,
and this pattern generally follows ‘conjunct/disjunct’ alignment (§11.2.1.1). The
Duna intentive inflection (§8.2.2.3), promissive inflection (§8.2.3.5), and the special
present inflection of the verb nga- ‘go’ (§8.2.3.6) typically occur with speaker sub-
jects in declarative sentences and addressee subjects in questions (show conjunct
distribution). The prophetic inflection (§8.2.3.3) typically occurs with non-speaker
subjects in declarative sentences and non-addressee subjects in interrogative sen-
tences (shows disjunct distribution).
    The conjunct/disjunct pattern is generally concerned with the relationship between
a participant (most commonly S or A) of a verbal clause and the person in the ut-
terance situation who is the epistemic source (Hargreaves 2005) with regard to the
proposition. For example, it is typically sensitive to whether the person in the speech
situation who has (best access to) knowledge of the described event also figures as
an agentive participant in it. The nature and implications of this distributional pat-
tern in Duna are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. For the time-being I focus
in the main on the basic meanings of these TAM markers in declarative sentences,
although a few interrogative examples are also introduced.
    Because of the significance of the conjunct/disjunct distributional pattern to
Duna grammar, it is useful to have a quasi-‘person’ term (additional to and cut-
ting across the grammatical categories of first, second, and third person encoded in
the Duna personal pronouns) that refers to the speaker of a declarative sentence, and
the addressee of an interrogative sentence. I use the term ‘informant’ for this kind
of person, following Bickel (2001) (as reported in Bickel and Nichols 2007). Note,
however, that my use of the term informant is not identical to that of Bickel, who
defines informant functionally as “the person whom the speaker supposes or claims  11
   Foley (2000:377) notes that a lack of such affixes is “relatively uncommon” in languages of
New Guinea.
280            Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
to be the immediate supplier of the information” (Bickel and Nichols 2007:223), and
with respect to different kinds of speech acts (that is, the informant is the speaker
in statements, the addressee in questions, Bickel 2007:2). My definition is tied to
formal sentence types of Duna (at this stage, declarative and interrogative) rather
than being completely functional.
    One other obvious way in which subject identity is relevant to verbal inflection
is in the context of directive inflections. For example, verbs that are inflected as
imperative have an addressee subject by pragmatic necessity. Imperative sentences
usually occur as commands, and the imperative inflection is not used in interrogative
sentences, so a conjunct/disjunct pattern is not observable. However, the desider-
ative (§8.2.2.4), prohibitive (§8.2.4.2), and hortative (§8.2.4.3) inflections occur in
optative sentences (§11.1), which can be transformed into interrogatives (for ex-
ample, with the addition of the interrogative marker =pe, §11.1.3.2). In these cases
we again see an alternation in correlations concerning subject identity that are de-
pendent on sentence type, with the markers generally showing disjunct-like distri-
bution. This is illustrated in §11.2.4; in this chapter I only discuss the use of these
markers in directive utterances and do not exemplify their use in questions.","[306, 307, 308, 309]"
"11.2.4      Deontic modality inflections
In this section I briefly outline the subject identity association of four TAM inflec-
tions that are particularly concerned with deontic modality: the promissive, hort-
ative, prohibitive, and desiderative. These subject identity associations show some
relationship to conjunct/disjunct marking in that they change according to whether
or not a sentence is marked as interrogative.
    Interrogatives formed with these inflections are questions of a sort in that the
speaker ‘requests information’ from the addressee. However, the information re-
quested relates not only to the correctness of a suggested proposition or the identity
of an unknown participant (as in typical interrogatives), but also to the addressee’s
deontic attitude towards the proposition: are they happy for it to happen, do they
think it should happen, will they commit to bringing it about?",[476]
"
  16
     Note also that the use of the prophetic inflection in questions generally signifies ‘diffusion’ of
information access, suggesting that the addressee does not necessarily know more about the ques-
tioned proposition than the speaker does; see §11.2.3.3. However, by further marking the prophetic
inflection with the sensory evidential, which does locate a particular informant, the questioners in
(931) manage to employ the most apposite future-time verbal inflection (that is, the prophetic inflec-
tion), whilst still maintaining the prophet’s ‘privileged access’ to knowledge of future events.

particular construction is pragmatically highly marked and is used to cast doubt
on another’s veracity, rather than for the speaker to express doubt about their own

"6.2.4    Shared knowledge
The epistemic demonstrative -ra (SHRD) marks a constituent as having a refer-
ent that is identifiable from shared knowledge between speaker and addressee(s).
This may be something that has been recently seen or otherwise experienced by
both discourse participants (situational use) or something that has been established
as having a definite identity within a text (tracking use).9 The shared knowledge
demonstrative typically occurs in combination with a group, pair, or role-marking
NP marker (§6.3.2.2-§6.3.4.3). Thus, -ra effectively functions as an alternative in-
dication of definiteness to the NP specificity marker -na, which does not usually oc-
cur in combination with other NP markers; see also remarks at the close of §6.3.2.1.
    Example (281) shows a question from Kenny Kendoli to Kiale Yokona (from
the same interview as examples 268-269b), in which Kenny talks about his own
sons. Kenny marks the NP which references his sons with -ra. These children have
not been mentioned previously in this interview and are not currently in view, but
Kenny is pointing out to Kiale that they both know who these boys are. (Kiale lives
some distance away and does not know Kenny’s family well, but has stayed the
previous night at Rewapi and seen the kids around.)(281)    ko nane kete no ingini -ra              mo-tia ka-ta            pikono se

    -ra typically occurs on NPs that do not have a referent currently visible to the discourse parti-
cipants, but it is not known whether this feature is actually specified by the morpheme.

    Example (282) shows -ra in an NP notionally headed by haka ‘clothes’, fol-
lowing the introduction of this item into the text several clauses previously.10 The
referentiality of this item is constituted both within the text and outside of it, as
Haya’s addressee has himself seen the bloodied clothes (being in fact the cause of
their state when he hit Haya), as well as hearing about them in her speech.(282)    no haka -ra-tia          yeta ko                iri-na.
         1SG cloth -SHRD-GP blood be/stand.PFV be.STAT-SPEC
         ‘These clothes of mine are bloodied.’ (T/HS:080305iii)    Example (283) shows a situation in which referentiality is established within
a text. The preceding few lines of this story decribe how a crowd of people have
miraculously appeared to keep a lonely boy company.(283)    yia, imaanoa ho-ra-tia              -aka ko.
         excl. people      here-SHRD-GP -COM be/stand.PFV
         ‘Hey, he lived with these people.’ (T/PK:080605ii)    The form -ra ‘SHRD’ is also used as a verbal inflection, in which case it spe-
cifies temporal features of the predicated activity (that is occurred in the recent
past), as well as indicating that the marked proposition represents shared knowledge
(§9.3.3.1).","[203, 204]"
"4.1.1.2    Adjectival predicates
An adjectival root can occur as the predicate of a non-verbal clause, as in (27) and
(28), expressing an attribute of an NP argument. (27)     nane ha-na         uka kone.
          boy there-SPEC long INTENS
          ‘That boy is very tall.’ (CD/XV:5)
   2
      However, the two possibilities are not equivalent in terms of information structure, as the re-
ordered clause Paka no rindi is more appropriate to a situation in which we are being informed
about the place Paka rather than about the speaker’s homeland.
    3
      Although I have not tested this, it seems possible that example (25) could be acceptable as the
response to a question such as ‘Who is Fred’s wife?’; i.e., when the NP Mbara ima can be interpreted
as having a particular referent rather than being a generic term.

 (28) Yuna haka paya.
          GPN   talk good
          ‘Duna language is good.’ (IV/HY-PK:150605i)    In the textual data, the construction exemplified in (27) and (28) is quite rare.
Adjectives more commonly head verbal rather than non-verbal clauses, as they are
typically marked with verbal inflections when they occur as simple predicates; see
§4.1.2.4.
    A phrase that includes the dependent form mo ‘like’ (see also §5.2.2) is func-
tionally equivalent to an adjective. These adjectival expressions can also occur as
predicates of non-verbal clauses as exemplified in (29) and (30).","[126, 127]"
"3.5     Adjectives
I refer to a group of Duna words that have formal features of both nominal and
verbal roots and generally describe properties of things as adjectives. Like nom-
inals and unlike verbs, adjectives can occur as clausal predicates in bare root form
(§4.1.1.2). They may also occur as modifiers in nominal phrases (§5.2.2). Adjectival
roots can be inflected with some morphology that is not available to nominal roots,
for example the habitual inflection -na (see, for example, (50)). Certain adjectives
can occur in a complex predicate construction with the verb ka- ‘be/stand’, describ-
ing the inception or achievement of a change of state (§7.5.4.3).15
    Some examples of Duna adjectives are shown in Table 3.7. I have grouped to-
gether adjectives that have some semantic features in common (for example, dealing
with dimension), but I do not propose that each group represents a distinct category.
The forms in Table 3.7 represent the four ‘core semantic types’ that are typically as-
sociated with the word class adjective (dimension, age, value and colour), as well as
the ‘peripheral semantic types’ of physical property and human propensity (Dixon
2004).
    As can be seen in Table 3.7, many adjectival words finish with a sequence Vo. In
Duna as spoken in the Kopiago area, the final o is subject to deletion in some lexical
items with no clear change in meaning or function.16 It is highly likely that this
final o is a semi-fossilised reflex of the perfective verbal inflection, -o (§8.2.2.1).17
  13
      Note that I designate these forms as members of a particular word class rather than as con-
stituents that are occupying a particular structural/functional position in construction with a verb.
This Duna word class could also be termed that of ‘coverbs’, following the use of this term in the
Australianist literature.
   14
      As a general rule, if the root is not attested occurring with final verb morphology (or has been
judged unacceptable in combination with it), typically occurs in bare root form, and immediately
precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb in all known examples, I interpret it as a verb adjunct, not a
verb.
   15
      The root kete ‘small’ can additionally be used in adverbial expressions (see, for example, (425)).
However this is not a general characteristic of adjectival roots.
   16
      Results of the orthography survey carried out with Duna speakers from the Kelabo area suggest
that deletion of the o is not acceptable for speakers of the south-west Duna variety.

                    roro        ‘hot’
                    mangene     ‘important’
                    koani       ‘new, unready’

                    epo         ‘tasty’
                    ndeo        ‘hard’ (GG)This analysis would suggest that the roots in question originally had a more clearly
inceptive or progressive meaning (e.g., ‘become big’, ‘become yellow’) and that the
perfective inflection was added to indicate complete achievement of the specified
change. This can also be argued for those adjectival roots that end in u, as the
perfective inflection has an allomorph -u.
    Some adjectival roots, such as kete ‘small’, typically occur in nominal phrases
whereas others such as rakare ‘cold’ typically occur as predicates of verbal clauses.
The latter term can be negated with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3), whereas
the former cannot. The behaviour of all adjectival roots with respect to this property
is not known. However, it is likely that further study will provide formal evidence
for the existence of different noun-like and verb-like classes within the proposed
group of adjectival roots, primarily relating to a distinction between properties that
are more time-stable, and those that are more dynamic.","[109, 110]"
"11.2.3     Intentive and prophetic inflections
11.2.3.1     Introduction
The intentive inflection -nda (§8.2.2.3) and prophetic inflection -na (§8.2.3.3) are
both used in describing future events, without any specification as to the immediacy
of these events (that is, unlike complex final inflections with -nda, see §10.2.2.2).
The morphemes are not systematically contrastive in that they are not formally equi-
valent (for example, the intentive is semi-finite and combines freely with ancillary
markers whereas the prophetic generally does not) and their semantics are not neatly
comparable (that is, they do not encode different values of a single semantic para-
meter). However, the distribution of the intentive and prophetic inflections follows
the conjunct/disjunct pattern quite closely, the intentive being a conjunct form and
the prophetic a disjunct form. The exception to this is in questions with third person
subjects, where the intentive is the more usual form. The typical distribution of the
intentive inflection -nda and prophetic inflection -na in declarative and interrogative
sentences is summarised in Table 11.4.",[467]
"                                 Table 3.17 Some manner adverbs               kokopo      ‘accidentally’

3.9     Interrogatives
Interrogatives are words that occur in questions to “indicate either all by themselves,
or with the help of syntactic features of the question in which they occur, which
part of the proposition the the asker is interested in knowing about” (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985:185), and thus typically (although not necessarily) delineate a gap in
speaker knowledge. Duna sentences that include an interrogative word are defined
as interrogative sentences (§11.1.3.5).
    Duna interrogatives split into two groups, non-derived and derived. Non-derived
interrogatives cannot be productively composed from extant morphemes (although
in most cases the forms suggest that they were originally compositional). Derived
interrogatives are formed from the interrogative root pa- ‘query’ in combination
with a bound morpheme, for example an NP marker.
  28
    An exception to this is sakore ‘quietly, slowly, gently’, which in one instance in the textual data
occurs with the iterative medial verb inflection, -rua (ITER).

that “[t]he set of interrogative pro-forms typically cuts across other part-of-speech
classes” and this is the case in Duna. For example, the interrogatives ai ‘who’
and aki ‘what’ are pronominal and occur in NPs (§5.3.3), whereas the interrogative
pro-form paneki ‘when’ stands for a temporal expression (380). Several of the non-
derived interrogatives have formal similarities and are almost certainly historically
related. For example akita ‘how many’ appears to be based on (or at least share an
etymology with) aki ‘what’.29 The words paneki, pania, pano and paneme probably
include the interrogative pa- (or a forebear of it).30
    The interrogative root pa- ‘query’ is formally most similar to a directional or loc-
ational demonstrative (§3.7), as it shares several distributional properties with these
classes (but does not exactly match the distributional properties of either). The kind
of missing information that pa- stands for will depend on the bound marker that
follows it and the syntactic context in which it occurs. Table 3.19 shows the dif-
ferent bound forms that are known to combine with pa-, the approximate meaning
of the resultant expression, and the section of this thesis where this expression is
discussed.
    An example of a phrase that functions similarly to an interrogative is the expres-
sion aki wata, ‘why?’, ‘what’s the reason?’. This is composed of the interrogative
form aki ‘what’ and the consonantal verb wa- ‘do’ inflected with the sequential
medial inflection -ta, so that it literally means something like ‘what happened and
then..?’. The hesitation pro-form apoko(ne), ‘whatchmacallit’ (§5.3.3.5) is similar
to an interrogative pro-form in that it stands for an unknown item. However this
does not function as interrogative, but acts as a filler while the speaker is trying to
remember a word, typically a nominal constituent.
  29
      Cochrane and Cochrane (1966:20) also note the existence of an interrogative akinda ‘how’. This
form does not occur in the 2003-7 data.
   30
      For example, the word paneme ‘how’ may be derived from morphemes that are related to the
currently productive forms pa- ‘query’, -ne ‘TYPE’, and -me ‘MNR’. However -ne and -me do not
otherwise co-occur.

3.10.1   Dependent postpositional modifiers
The forms angu ‘only, just’ (glossed as ‘RESTRICT’) and kone ‘truly, very, really’
(glossed as ‘INTENS’) are dependent postpositional modifiers. The intensifier kone
can modify nominal phrase constituents, verbs, temporals and manner adverbs.
The form angu typically modifies nominal phrases. These forms are phonological
words, but do not occur as independent utterances. I treat these words as part of the
constituent which they modify, and they are not further discussed in this thesis, but
can be observed in many of the example sentences.","[120, 121, 122]"
"   Secondly, it is relevant to the way that markers of epistemic assessment always
imply ‘speakers’, not just in the sense of the actual speakers of particular utter-
11.3. Epistemic assessment and the final predicate: an overview                              453
ances, but people who can think and talk - those with conscious minds.31 Typic-
ally the ‘conscious minds’ that markers of epistemic assessment evoke are those
of people in the actual discourse situation, the speaker and addressee. Information
status markers, for example, do not only indicate how the speaker thinks/knows
about the activity that is predicated in his or her utterance, but encode awareness that
the addressee also thinks, and has a particular state of mind as regards the propos-
ition. This awareness is also evident in the viewpoint shift exhibited by evidential
markers in questions, by which the speaker can effectively tell the addressee ‘how to
know’. The impersonal evidential markers alternatively allude to consciousness that
is anchored in unspecified people, indicating that the predicated event is observable
through the relevant perceptual faculty, without identifying exactly whose.
    Using bound markers of epistemic assessment thus requires paying close atten-
tion at some level to the fact that the ‘information’ of spoken language is expressive
of human consciousness, and constituted (as well as constitutive) of human experi-
ence. This may be experience of the outside world, or the more internal experience
of ‘having things in mind’.
    The theme of the speaker-proposition relationship carries through to some of the
inflectional morphemes that I identify as TAM markers (§8.2) rather than evidential
or information status markers. The encoding of a ‘relationship to mind’ is important
to the meanings of the intentive and prophetic inflections, which imply intention and
(visuo-)perception, respectively. These forms display the same kind of patterns with
respect to subject identity and volition as the evidential markers, so that a clause so
marked says something about the relationship of the informant to the activity that is
described. Certain other inflections that have to do with event modality also appeal
to a person’s internal construal of an event (for example, as something desirable),
and show a comparable alternation as regards the identity of the subject in optative
as opposed to interrogative sentences.
    Bound forms that provide indication of epistemic assessment in Duna do not
comprise a discrete grammatical category. Certain formal characteristics typify cer-
tain collections of morphemes, but these do not map consistently to distinct se-
mantic or functional domains. For example, I find it sensible to treat the forms
identified as evidential markers as comprising a discrete paradigm, but these do not
stay tidily in their box according to rigorous formal and semantic criteria. Typical
formal features of the evidential markers (for example, the ability to be added to  31
     The phrase ‘conscious mind’ is approximated in the Duna existential possessive construction
predicated by kono ra- (thought/knowledge be/put-), to ‘have thought/knowledge’. I found that kono
iripe, ‘Does it have thought?’ was the one of the questions children would most commonly ask
on seeing unfamiliar animals in the nature programmes we sometimes watched on my computer at
Rewapi.
454                               Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
both bare and inflected verb forms) are shared by at least some other morphemes,
and not by all markers of the set. A semantic characterisation, as ‘indicating inform-
ation source’ is not entirely representative of the markers’ uses (see for example
§9.2.6), and the impersonal evidential markers in particular show some semantic
commonality with the information status markers, as they are concerned with the
minds of people other than the speaker. Similarly, the information status mark-
ers show some relationship to ‘source of information’, albeit as something that is
defined in reference to the speech situation rather than (or as well as) the percep-
tual mode by which the predicated event is known. Additionally, what I identify
as a central theme of epistemic assessment, the encoding of a relationship between
speaker and proposition, is attested in morphemes that are formally indistinguish-
able from TAM markers (for example, the intentive and prophetic inflections, the
‘provocative’ markers, see §9.3.4), morphemes that do not share the typical formal
capacity to occur as ancillary markers as well as primary inflections.
    It is similarly difficult to identify epistemic assessment as something that is ob-
ligatorily encoded on the final predicate. However, it is not really easy to identify
any single semantic category as being obligatorily encoded on final predicates in
Duna. Generally, it seems fair to say that a final verbal predicate must be inter-
pretable as regards an actualisation/time value for the predicated event in relation to
the time of the speech event. If this is not specified by a TAM marker, it is supplied
through an information status marker, or through the time-reference that is specified
or implicated by an inflectional evidential marker.
    Questions remain as to whether it is also true to say that epistemic assessment
values are implicated by TAM markers. It is probably the case that using inflections
such as the stative, perfective, and habitual as the only marking on a final verb at
least have connotations of certainty and personal experience, in contrast to all the
other kinds of experience that could be marked, and this is an important issue that
requires further investigation, with particular emphasis on conversational data. If it
is the case that such inflections supply epistemic assessment features, these prob-
ably arise through partially contrastive relationships of functional opposition, rather
than from the minimally contrastive encoding of recognisably constant parameters,
although the latter is also possible, with information source being a particularly
likely candidate.
    Epistemic assessment is thus neither a strictly obligatory nor formally coherent
grammaticised category in Duna. It is possible to create any number of well formed
sentences without overtly encoding features that relate specifically to the treatment
of the proposition as knowledge. Nevertheless, the expression of such features is
pervasive in the language, richly encoded by a range of bound morphemes that have
11.3. Epistemic assessment and the final predicate: an overview                 455
an array of formal, functional and combinatorial properties. These forms support
and comprise recognition that to speak is to engage in the creation, interpretation,
and assessment of a collaboratively known and realised world.

the same participant occupies the same argument position (S, A, or P) in the follow-
ing clause. There is only one occasion (clause (b)) in which an opportunity for zero
anaphora based on this principle is not taken.20 From impressionistic observation,
this is fairly typical of narrative text. However, it is by no means a requirement that
a participant be both referenced in a preceding clause and maintain an unchanged
argument position in order to be elided. This is seen in a further excerpt from the
same text, shown in (86). The speaker (on being questioned) is talking in more de-
tail about the way the snake was caught—an event that was referred to in a single
clause (85h) earlier in the text. At this point the speaker and the addressee (LSR) are
walking around the site that this event took place, so gesture and real-world location
play a significant part in the explanation of what happened.",[144]
"9.2.2.2    Personal or impersonal viewpoint
I divide Duna evidential markers into ‘personal’ and ‘impersonal’ forms. Personal
evidentials entail an identifiable perceiver who has a specific viewpoint. This per-
ceiver is typically understood to be the informant person (speaker in declaratives,
addressee in interrogatives, see §11.2.2.1). In extended narrative a central charac-
ter can also be treated as a perceiver, in which case evidential markers reflect this
character’s viewpoint as events unfold.5 All personal evidential markers can occur
   5
    Cf. Banfield’s (1982) discussion of the ‘subjective character’ in narrative, a participant whose
consciousness is adopted, and through whom the reader/listener becomes focussed on the direct
experience of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions (Chun and Zubin 1990). See also Lawrence’s
310                                 Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
with ancillary as well as primary inflectional function and can be followed by the
specificity marker -na; see Chapter 10. Each evidential category in Duna also has
a form that marks impersonal perception, rather than representing a specific view-
point. At least some of the impersonal forms can be used as ancillary markers.
Unlike the personal forms, impersonal evidential markers do not generally occur in
interrogative sentences, and are not marked with -na.
    The personal/impersonal contrast relates somewhat to languages in which the
identity of the perceiver(s) as the speaker, addressee, or both, may be indicated by
a bound form that is portmanteau with or added to an evidential marker. This kind
of feature is found in (relatively) nearby languages of the New Guinea Highlands
region (see Rule 1977; Madden MS; Sillitoe MS; Loughnane and San Roque forth-
coming), as well as further afield (Kroeker 2001 on Nambikuara, Brazil6 ). In Angal
(Mendi), for example, there is a marker which can be added following an evidential
morpheme to signal that both speaker and hearer perceive the evidence in question
(Madden MS).
    In Nambikuara, morphemes that comprise the ‘evidential suffix system’ make
reference to kinds of evidence, for example marking ‘deductive orientation’ (similar
to the Duna results evidential category), and to ‘verification’, which may be either
‘individual’ or ‘collective’. These suffixes indicate tense and occur in combination
with aspect suffixes. Kroeker paraphrases use of an ‘individual verification, de-
ductive orientation’ suffix as signaling “I’m telling you my deduction of an action
that must have occurred because of something I saw/see” (2001:63). In contrast, a
‘collective verification, deduction orientation’ suffix signals “both speaker and ad-
dressee deduce that an action must have taken place” (2001:64). Two examples that
contrast with respect to ‘verification’ value but have the same ‘orientation’ value of
reported evidence (termed ‘narration orientation’ by Kroeker) are shown in (740)
and (741).7(740)    wa3 kon3 -∅-ta1 hẽ1 -la2

9.2. Evidential markers                                                                               311
    Although there is some commonality between such systems and Duna, in that a
‘single perceiver’ is contrasted with ‘more than one (potential) perceiver’, the Duna
impersonal forms do not specifically identify the speaker and addressee as joint
perceivers, but rather identify evidence as perceivable without saying by whom.
However, we can see that the Angal, Nambikuara, and Duna systems are all sens-
itive to the notion of differential access to evidence. The use of speaker-only or
personal terms typically highlights one person as probably having better access to
certain evidence or knowledge than anyone else in the speech situation. In contrast,
collective or impersonal terms place the speaker and addressee on a roughly equal
footing in terms of access to evidence. This has some significance to which kinds

     I suggest that this marker is originally derived from a combination of -ra ‘SHRD’ with the
interrogative marker =pe (§11.1.3.2); the fact that a proposition is marked as both ‘collectively
known’ and questioned means in effect that ‘nobody knows’. However, -rape is a fossilised rather
productively formed sequence, as neither of the posited components follow the distributional patterns
of the currently productive forms; e.g., the interrogative marker =pe does not precede evidential
markers in ancillary constructions, whereas -rape does (see Chapter 10).

"11.2.2.6     Extended disassociation
As exemplified in sections 11.2.2.2 and 11.2.2.3, use of visual evidentials typically
implies that the informant did not participate voluntarily in the predicate activity.
The non-participatory implication of evidential markers can be extended to a sense
that the predicated activity has ‘nothing to do with’ the informant. This is illustrated
by the contrast shown between (1088) and (1089).

    Example (1088) shows a fragment of conversation between myself and Richard
Alo. On seeing Richard at Kopiago station, he asked me the whereabouts of my
fellow researcher Kirsty Gillespie, whom I was sharing a house with in the field.
I replied using the sentence shown in (1088b), using the visual evidential -rua.
Richard corrected me, saying that I should use the stative form of the verb (rei)
instead. As someone who was typically ‘at the house’ with Kirsty, it was not right
for me to talk about her presence there using a visual evidential.(1088)     a. RA: Kesti pano.

asked of me by Philemon Heri when I met him on the path to his house, I coming
away and he heading homewards. Philemon asked me if his mother (Metai) was at
their family house, inflecting the verb with the visual evidential. Philemon is coding
my (not his own) relationship to the predicated activity; I do not live with Metai,
and it is sensible for me to talk about her presence at home as ‘seen’.","[464, 465]"

         ‘Petros came just today {you saw}?’ (CD/VIII:8)    In keeping with a disjunct form distributional pattern (§11.2.1.1), evidential
marking may also occur on declaratives with addressee subjects, as in (1059) and
(1060), and interrogatives with speaker subjects, as in (1061). The latter situation
in particular is functionally/pragmatically marked, and may highlight the fact of
the evidence itself rather than of the predicate activity. Timon Kangapu suggested
to me that a question such as that shown in (1061) would be suitable for a court
dispute situation, in which the speaker refutes a claim by the addressee concerning
their (the speaker’s) activities. The interrogative is rhetorical as the speaker already
knows whether they went or not; this utterance questions the addressee’s evidence,
covertly asserting that the activity did not happen.(1059)     anoa hinanda-ta ru-yarua.

         (CD/XIV:76)    Evidential marking typically does not occur in declaratives with a volitional
speaker subject, or interrogatives with a volitional addressee subject. Such marking
is generally judged odd or ungrammatical. I found that this judgment was partic-
ularly strong concerning visual and sensory category evidential markers; KK, RA,
PK and KP all categorically rejected constructed declaratives such as (1062) and
(1063) (speaker subject + visual or sensory evidential) and interrogatives such as
(1064) and (1065) (addressee subject + visual or sensory evidential) as unsayable.(1062) * no hutia

evidential markers in some constructed sentences. These were not judged to be
ungrammatical, as a sensible interpretation of a third person subject argument was
readily plausible in each case. In (1066) and (1067), the pronouns that correspond
to the informant were assumed to be object NPs, and subject NPs were assumed to
be elided (§4.2.3.3). In (1068) the second person pronoun ko was assumed to refer
to a possessor, and the subject NP elided.(1066)    no ke-ya     hutia.

         ‘[They] steambaked your pig {you infer}?’ (CD/VIII:3)    The examples shown in this section illustrate that evidential markers exhibit a
disjunct distributional pattern in that they are typically inappropriate for (volitional)
informant subjects but are generally appropriate in other contexts.19 Activities in
which one is a volitional and controlling participant (an agentive subject) are more
normally presented as ‘directly’ experienced, not mediated by perceptual evidence.
    As we have already seen in several examples in the preceding chapters, within
narrative texts, it is often the perceptual world of a main protagonist in the story
that is important to the choice of evidential marker, rather than the viewpoint of
the actual speaker (the storyteller). The typical collocation of informant and per-
ceiver is not maintained, because the storyteller commonly steps back and forth
between his or her own viewpoint (for example, using the previous notional evid-
ential in its ‘hearsay’ marking function) and information sources that are present
in the story-world as in (1069). In such cases, the usual implications that relate to
subject identity (and volition, see following) are transferred to the individual (or
group of individuals) that is the empathic deictic centre at this point in the narrative.
That is, evidential markers that evoke a protagonist’s information source will occur
in situations where this protagonist is not a volitional subject.(1069)     ra-ta       ka-ta,          khene kaki-ra-ra              khulau-yatia.

One context in which evidential markers do occur with informant subjects is when
the described activity is non-volitional. This is a common pattern in languages with
evidential morphology (cf. Curnow 2003), and is quite typical of disjunct forms in
languages with conjunct/disjunct systems.20 Examples (1070) - (1072) are headed
  19
      It would be somewhat misleading to say that evidential markers are highly suitable to all non-
informant subjects, as interrogatives that combine a volitional speaker subject with an evidential
marker are also atypical (see (1061)). However, this ‘oddness’ stems in the main from an unusual
arrangement of subject identity and speech act type (i.e., people do not typically ask questions about
their own volitional activities), rather than solely from incongruity of subject identity and predicate
morphology.
   20
      However it may not be a necessary attribute of such systems; see Curnow (2002) concerning
Awa Pit.

  21
     I would not say that it is entirely typical to mark involuntary experience clauses for sensory
evidence in this way; in the textual data (which includes many descriptions of speakers’ illnesses,
fears, emotional responses, etc.) it appears just as usual for people to use non-evidential inflections
in recounting these kinds of personal experiences. However, sentences such as (1070) - (1072) are
always accepted as perfectly sensible and sayable, in contrast to the ungrammatical volitional subject
examples shown in (1063) and (1065).
