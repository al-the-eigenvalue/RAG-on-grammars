Answers to negative questions are treated as in English, i.e. wa? 'no' con-
firms the negation of the questioned sentence (cf. 1179), and e£ 'yes' contra-
dicts the negative assumption of the question (cf. 1180).",[440]

Parametric questions (= constituent questions, question-word questions) are
formed by substituting an interrogative pronoun (cf. 11.5.) for the ques-
tioned constituent. The phrase containing the interrogative pronoun is
usually in preverbal position, but it may also be in clause-initial position (cf.
(1186a)).","[440, 441]"
"
23.3. Indirect (i.e. subordinate) questions
23.3.1. Ordinary indirect questionsIndirect polar and parametric questions are marked by the Conditional suf-
fix -t'a on the verb. Indirect alternative questions use the Interrogative suf-
fix -ni.",[445]
"
23.5. Question particles
Several discourse particles are often used in questions (for other discourse
particles, see 13.3.). They express various nuances of the tone of the question
and are hard to translate into English. Like other discourse particles, they are
either sentence-initial or follow the verb directly.
23.5.1. bes
This sentence-initial particle is perhaps the most common question particle.
This particle often conveys the speaker's expectation of a negative answer.(1207) a. Bes xalq'.di-n nexir ni                       xil-da? (Du85,3:115)

generally used in (polar or parametric) questions with the Conditional suffix
-t'a (23.3.2.).(1208) a. Jarab        zi          bagri     weled.di-n        q'il.e-l           wuö

23.4. Echo questions
In (1205M1206), some examples are given for echo questions asking for clari-
fication on a previous question. The echo question may be partial, as in
(1205), or complete, as in (1206). Note that the interrogative suffix -ni cannot
be used in such echo questions.(1205) a. A· Kwe-z                 wuö        gerek       ja,      xala?

23.3.2. ""Indirect questions"" used as independent sentencesSentences whose main verb is in the Conditional mood can also be used as
independent sentences and express hesitating questions, self-addressed ques-
tions (Ί wonder...'), and statements with low probability. They can perhaps
be regarded as ""indirect questions used as independent sentences"".
(However, such ""independent indirect questions"" of the alternative type dif-
fer from indirect alternative questions, where the Conditional mood is not
used, cf. 23.3.1.3. above.)  ""Polar questions"":(1202) a. Ewer-α         kwan     ada-z, —            bujrug     ga-na            pafah.di,

"See 22.4. for further discussion of the conditions for the use of reflexive
pronouns.
   The reflexive pronouns are also used as emphatic reflexives, analogous to
Russian sam or German selbst. The emphatic use of the reflexive pro-
nouns may indicate that the noun it modifies occupies a central position
with respect to some periphery (cf. 427), or that an agent acts independently

tu&t'a, the Conditional of the negated standard copula, is used in the same
function.) Taxajt'a can optionally be preceded by ja.
   TaStajt'a is obligatory in alternative questions (23.1.3.):(912) Wun         qe          qwe-da-ni           (ja) taxajt'a                  paka?

"23.7. Non-indicative questions
Questions may be in the Optative or Hortative mood (cf. also 9.8.3.-9.8.4.).
Hortative questions are deliberative, i.e. the speaker asks him/herself (or

are listed in dictionaries in this form. The Masdar is an action nominaliza-
tion. For instance, the verb stem aqwaz- 'stop' has the Masdar aqwaz-un,
which means '(the fact or action of) stopping'.
   The Masdar is noun-like only with respect to its external syntax: It can be
inflected for any case (the oblique stem is in -(u)n-i-, cf. 7.1.2.2. (C)), and it
can occur in all environments where NPs can occur. However, in its inter-
nal syntax, it behaves completely like a verb. It does not take adjective or
Genitive modifiers or determiners; but it does take adverbial modifiers, and
the verbal arguments appear in the same form as in finite clauses.(336) qhsan-diz          k'walax-un

'themselves' or sad 'one':(1164) Cükwer.a-ni              Sajran.a        6pi=öeb                        quiaxlamiS-na.
       Qikwer(ERG)-and          Sajran(ERG)     selves(ERG)=selves embrace-AOR
       'Cükwer and Sajran embraced each other.' (S88:51)

       'Cuckoos talk to each other like humans.' (K87,2:6)As can be seen from these examples, the first component of the reciprocal
expression is in the same case as the antecedent, and the second component
bears the case that is required in the syntactic position of the reciprocal ex-
pression. A few more examples are given in (1166)-(1167).(1166) a. Kic'-ni      kac öeb=öpi-n                    duSman-ar         ja. (A90:20)

                                      Questions23.1. Polar questions
23.1.1. Ordinary polar questionsOrdinary polar questions (= yes-no questions) are marked by the interroga-
tive mood affix -ni on the finite verb of the sentence. (Note that this affix is
phonologically identical to the coordinator and focus marker -ni 'and, also'
(cf. 18.1.1.). However, the two affixes are easily distinguished because they do
not occur in the same environments: interrogative -ni can only be suffixed
to a finite verb, while coordinating/focusing -ni can be attached to every-
thing except finite verbs.)
    The intonation is rising-falling on the finite verb form.(1169) a. Betxoven.a-n        muzyka          wa-z        k'an-da-ni?   (DD77,1.12)

418   23. Questions   If the question expresses surprise or doubt, the interrogative affix may be
omitted. The interrogative meaning is then expressed only by the intona-
tion (rising on the finite verb form).(1170) a. Wi          dust.uni-z       pul       2ga-naV.

"  Wiri may also be used following an NP, i.e. quantifier floating is possible
with wiri. The NP quantified in this way may be in any case form. Wiri ap-
pears in its substantivized form and agrees with the NP it quantifies in case.
With a personal pronoun, floating is the only possibility, cf. (477).(477) a. Cun         wiri      ha     pat.a-qh           kilig-na. (J84:5)

"   Since the standard of comparison is marked by the Subelative case (cf.
24.1.1.), and not by a particle as in English or Russian, it is easy to question it
in Lezgian:(1187) Hi        dag.di-laj           Sahdag       aq'an     ja?

guzwa 'gives', guzwa-c 'does not give'). Non-finite and non-indicative verb
forms are negated by prefixal negation. In most verbs this means pe-
riphrastic negation involving the negative auxiliary t-awun 'not do', but a
closed set of verbs take the negative prefix t(A)- (a high vowel occurs only in
tü-t'ü-n 'not to eatO themselves, i.e. they have inflectional, not periphrastic,
prefixal negation. According to Moor (1985), this closed class consists of the
following members:  Masdar            negated Masdar
  awun              t-awun (t-iji-, t-awu-)       'do'
  qhuwun            ta-xwun                       'do again'
  kun               ta-±un (te-ie-, ta-£a-)       'become'
  xun               ta-xun                        'give birth'

  xün               te-xiXn                       'keep, guard'

  q'in              te-q'in                       'kill'
  q'un              ta-q'un                       'hold'
  tun               ta-tun (ti-ta-, ta-tu-)       'leave, admit, cause'   Note that all of these verbs are strong, and most of them are monosyl-
labic. Even the disyllabic verbs in this class have disyllabic negated forms
(the root vowel is deleted in taxwun, talhun, tewhin).
   This class is becoming smaller and smaller. Already now, Moor notes,
most of the above verbs can alternatively be negated periphrastically, except
for awun and xun. And in Uslar (1896:§258, §274), the class is much larger.
Uslar lists about sixty verbs with inflectional prefixal negation, including
weak and polysyllabic verbs, e.g.:  aqwazun           t-aqwazun                     'stop'
  eqiigun           t-eqiigun                     'scold'
  rasun             ta-rasun                      'repair'   Periphrastic prefixal negative forms are formed with the auxiliary t-
awun 'not do' and the Periphrasis form. The Periphrasis form is always
identical to the base in weak verbs, and in strong verbs it is most commonly
identical to the Masdar, e.g.:

      officers now.' (S88:161)In Gadiiev (1963:152), wuöiz lahajt'a is treated as a conjunction that intro-
duces a causal adverbial clause. However, the sentence introduced by wuöiz
lahajt'a has none of the properties that are characteristic of subordinate
clauses in Lezgian. In particular, it cannot precede the ""caused"" sentence,
and it cannot be focused. So his analysis of wuöiz lahajt'a as a subordinat-
ing conjunction is probably only motivated by the fact that it often translates
Russian subordinating conjunctions of cause.
   However, GadZiev presents a plausible and intriguing scenario for the
diachronic source of wuöiz lahajt'a: a rhetorical question ""Why is it said?"",
anticipating a potential question by the interlocutor, which has later been
grammaticized to a conjunction-like element. This explains both the inter-
rogative word wuöiz 'why?' and the conditional mood of lahajt'a.           (Cf.
Herring 1991 for a very similar change in Tamil.)16.3.5.4. Conjunctional adverbs of condition. The adverbial expression
taxajt'a is used in the sense 'otherwise'. Taxajt'a is the negated Conditional
form of £un 'be', so taxajt'a is literally 'if it is nof. (For taxajt'a in the sense
Or', cf. 18.2.2.).",[330]
"Since Lezgian prefers verb-final word order, background-first constructions
as in (975) are more common. They cannot always be translated by English
wh-cleft sentences. For example, when the focus is a focus of a focus particle
or the focus of a parametric question, as in (977), a wh-cleft is impossible in
English.(977) a. Ana         k'walax-aj-di        sa zun ja-ni? (HQ89:13)

Discourse particles express various subtle pragmatic meanings that are hard
to render in a language like English which makes little use of discourse par-
ticles. In this section, some example sentences are also accompanied by
German translations where a German equivalent is available.
   Lezgian discourse particles generally occupy a marginal position in the
sentence. Most of them are sentence-final (after the finite verb), but a few
are sentence-initial.

course particles, are treated in 23.5.","[260, 261]"

such an easy thing. (2) It is more difficult than other things to solve these
problems for peoples with a young literary language like our Lezgians. (3) In
this area we do not have the same experience that other peoples have. (4)
Our way is not an open way like other peoples' way. (5) We are now finding
our ways.
   (6) In this book which I have written, the problem of the Lezgian literary
language and the orthography has not been definitely solved. (7) It is a first
attempt which was undertaken to find a way for solving the problems that I
posed in this book. (8) Therefore, I ask readers and, in particular, teachers to
look for shortcomings in this book with a critical eye and point them out.","[497, 498]"
"23.1.2. Polar questions with a focused constituentA constituent is focused in an interrogative sentence by clefting it (cf. 19.4.
for more on cleft sentences). The constituent may be fronted (with the cop-
ula + -ni following it immediately), as in the examples in (1171). However,
this kind of fronting does not seem to be particularly common.(1171) a. Qe       ja-ni     Musa.di         Alfija.di-z        tup'al      gu-da-j-di?

23.2.4. Cleft parametric questionsSince the interrogative phrase in a parametric question is focused, it is often
clefted (cf. 19.4.). Some examples:(1195) a. Wui         ja      rak'-ar gata-zwa-j-di?           (X89:27)
