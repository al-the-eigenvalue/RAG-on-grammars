"1. Imperative          sentences
The imperative sentence type is distinguished by means of verb
morphology, that is, by use of the Imperative verb forms (see
6.1.1). Therefore, this sentence type is described and exemplified
in 6.2.8; this section contains only some marginal notes.
    In order to propose a common action (i.e., instead of the 1PL
Imperative), the main (Indicative) 1PL form can be used, with or,
less frequently, without the Future marker (see also 6.2.3).
(812)   a. wted%-din     irk-in     mieste Sagal’a-t-il’?
           [speak-SUP} one-ATTR place       gather-FUT-INTR:1PL
           ‘Let us gather in one place in order to speak.’ [K1]
474      Chapter 13. Sentence types and negation           b. tannugt        gudel’e-jili
              CA             get.prepared-INTR:1PL
               ‘Then let us prepare everything.’ [F31]
With the second person Imperative, the particle jag ‘come (on)’
can be used:
 (813)     a. jag gon             logkara Sobohora kes’t-k
              IMP go{IMP:2sG) | spoon     plate     bring-IMP:28G
              ‘Come on, go and bring spoons and plates.’ [F13]
           b. jag     Gugon       ozt-nin          anzej-ni-k!
              IMP     quickly     water-DAT        go.down-PL-IMP:2
               ‘Come on, go quickly and bring water.’ [F29]
           c. ug-re-p-tie,        jag    ukej-delle             gaqga-nin
               child-PL-DIM       IMP    ([go.out-SS:PFV]       grandfather-DAT
               tit      gorobo     igeje-s-telle                      tadi-qi-k
               your    cow         [rope-PRPR:CAUS-SS:PFV|            give-PL-IMP:2
               ‘Children, go, tie your cow and give it to
               grandfather.’ [F27|
This particle can be etymologically related to the verb jaqa- ‘ar-
rive, reach’.
    The subject of the Imperative is normally omitted (813), yet
this is not an obligatory feature of this sentence type (814).
 (814)     a. id% tet met-ul Sgrile-
              now you I-ACC paint-CAUS(IMP:2SG)
              ‘Now paint me!’ [F5]
           b. tet     and’e-g                      met-ul
               you eye-CAUS(IMP:28G) Lacc
               ‘Do endow me with an eye!’ [F31|
           c. tet     Gupte      lende-k
              you     always     eat-DETR-IMP:28G
               ‘Always eat!’ [F9]
See 6.2.8 for further examples.
   The Imperative is incompatible                  with     the grammatical       Focus
marking (6.1.1.2).
                                                                 Questions   4752. Questions
 2.1. Polar questions
2.1.1. Ordinary polar questions
The ordinary polar question (yes-no question) is not marked mor-
phologically; the interrogative meaning is expressed only by a ris-
ing intonation contour (Krejnovich 1982:150). A question can have
the form of an affirmative (815) or negative (816) clause:
 (815)   a. éolhore,     Golhora     l’e-jek?
            hare         hare        be-INTR:28G
            ‘Hare, hare, are you here?’ [F13}

            ‘Haven’t you burned down yet?’ [F31]
2.1.2. Alternative questions and the disjunctive/interrogative par-
        ticle du
Disjunction in alternative questions is expressed by a clause-final
particle du, which is repeated after each of the disjoined alterna-
tives:

               be.needed+STAT-SF DSJ:ITR
               ‘Which fox (de you need)? Do you need the silver fox,
               or the red fox, or do you need the squirrel?’ [F38]

               ‘Let the rope stretch! Is it strong (enough), or will he
                   tear it up?’ [F3]]
If the disjoined alternatives are an assertion and its negation, the
latter can be represented by the negative form of the existential
verb, oj-l’e (lit. ‘there is no’); see (818). In this case, the disjunc-
tive particle can be absent from the first clause (819a), or from
both clauses (819b).
 (818) a. kenme-n-d’ek                                    dit         oj-l’e

               not?’ [F14|

               ‘Have I killed it or not?’ [F48]
 (819)      a. met-kele          min-te-m                       modo-te-r.

               NEG-be(NEG:38G)                  DSJ:ITR
                                                                       Questions   477           ‘Will he take me, will he settle me here or not?’ [F31]
        b. tay      Sorome          ed’-i               oj-Ve?

           ‘Is that man alive or not?’
On the other hand, this particle can mark a question without an
explicitly expressed alternative:
(820)   a. €ejli-s’                     du?
           be.far-INTR:3SG              DSJ:ITR.
           ‘Is it far?’ [F48]
        b. me+n’oho-j                         du?
           AFF+falL-INTR:3SG                  DSJAITR
           ‘Did he fall down?’
This particle can also be used in declarative contexts. In two
examples in my corpus, it is used clause-internally in order to
disjoin constituents of a declarative clause (821). In one example,
it is used to disjoin declarative clauses (822).

2.1.3. The contrastive/negative particle eil’e
The particle efl’e has the general semantic effect of contrasting two
propositions, one of which remains implicit. The implicit propo-
sition is presented as false, in contrast with that expressed by the
clause. This particle is used in Indicative sentences (2.1.3.1), in
tag questions (2.1.3.2), and for negative responses (2.1.3.3).
2.1.3.1. In Indicative sentences, the clause-final particle ell’e is
used to contrast the proposition expressed in the clause to what
might be presupposed (823a), apparently evident {823b), expected
(823c), or desired (823d):

              appears), there must be something it would be afraid
              of.’ |F31]
           c. tan   and’e        el+n’oho                     ell’e

              ‘Our place was far away, after all (however willing we
              were to reach it).’2.1.3.2. This particle can be used for a sort of tag question. It
signifies that the proposition expressed by the clause is assumed
by the speaker to be true, and contrasts this assumption with the
potential negative response.
 (824)     a. ta      dogtor      l’e-j              ell’e?

dialogue; the previous turn can be either an assertion (825a) or a
polar question (825b).
(825)      a. “el+kej-te-je,                       Sejre-j-te-jek”

2.1.4. Ask-to-repeat verb
There      is a special           verb   used    for requests      to repeat         the previ-
ous utterance          (Krejnovich          1982:151).      Such     requests are built
as questions containing only the second person form of the verb
monohot-""4 (cf. mon- ‘say’):
 (826)         tay      para-ge            tat   mon-de-ge         irk-in
               [that time-LOC              CA    say-3SG-Ds]       one-ATTR

               ‘At that time, when he said this, the One-eyed one

Note that the same function can be fulfilled by means of a question-
word question with the basic speech act verb mon- ‘say’:
 (827)         e-e     Saget        lem-dik         = mon-me?
               Int]    now         what-PRED         say-OF:2SG
               ‘Hi, what have you just said?’ [F31]2.2.     Question-word questions
2.2.1. Questioning constituents of the main clause
Any constituent of the clause can be questioned (see 7.1.3 for in-
terrogative pro-forms used for such questions}. The linear position
                                                                Questions   481of the question word is rather flexible; it can occur either in the
position most typical for the constituent type (831b), (832b) or be
sentence-initial; see (830b), (831a).°%
   The verb normally takes the Interrogative form (see 6.1.1.1);
however,   the Indicative main      forms    are also possible;      see, e.g.,
(828b), (835a), with the exception of first-person forms which can
be only Interrogative. Questions to the S/O constituent obliga-
torily involve Focus marking, including the Focus-indicating verb
form. The following examples illustrate question-word questions
to other types of constituents.%

The locative question word          gon and the existential verb /’e can
form a complex expression gol+l’e ‘where’, which may (841b) but
need not (841c) take the verb agreement markers:
(837)   a. tan meme gol+Ve

The descriptive nominal predicate (see 72.1.1) can be questioned
by putting an interrogative pronoun in the predicative position:
(838)   a. neme-pe-lek?
           what-PL-PRED
           ‘Who are they?’ [F31]
        b. tugn    tet-ke        neme-lek?
           this    you-LOC       what-PRED
           ‘What’s up with you?’ (F54]
484      Chapter 18.     Sentence   types and negation            Cc.   kin+y0-k?
                  who+CoOP-ITR:28G
                  ‘Who are you?’
The verbal predicate can be questioned by means of the combina-
tion of the question word godo ‘how’ with the verb a- ‘make’ or
l’e- ‘be’ (see 7.1.3). The former option is employed when both the
A participant and the O participant of the action being questioned
are specified or implied (839), the latter, if only one participant
is specified, independently of its role in the situation being ques-
tioned, i.e., such a question can mean both ‘What did/will X do?’
(840) and ‘What happened/will happen to X?’ (841).                         The neg-
ative marker on such a complex signifies negation of a possible
situation involving specified participants (841b).

Any      noun    modifier can be questioned.                The following examples
illustrate questions to the possessive modifier (842), the attributive
modifier (843), and to the scalar quantifier (844).

Constituents of non-finite clauses can be questioned, yet such ex-
amples are rather rare:

One question can contain two question words:

              be-SF
              ‘How many people are in which place?’
 2.3. Negative/dubitative use of questions
The form of a question-word question can be used to negate the
proposition expressed by the clause, or to present it as doubtful.
In the combination with the Future form of the verb (6.2.3), this
gives the meaning of impossibility or at least crucial complications
in accomplishing the action. The question word of manner godo
gives a more general meaning                  (847), other question words can
be conceived as specifying a particular component of a situation
which is lacking (848).
(847) a. inluge             met    ner         naha     eris’                 godo

If there is no Future marker, a question-like clause with godo can
express just somewhat emphasized negation (849), a clause with
noyon ‘what for’, the absence of reason (purposelessness) of the
action that has taken place (850).

it can be followed by a question-like exclamation:

490      Chapter 13. Sentence types and negationThe interjection idek ‘no, well really!, what                 next!’     is used   for

"5.1.4. “Indirect speech”?
There seems to be no grammatically established phenomenon of
“Indirect speech”: generally, the contents of speech are reported
by means of quotations.      Some features of indirect speech can
be found only in a few examples. In (879a), the 2sG verb form
in the reporting element identifies it is as an instance of indirect
speech (a quotation would have involved the 1sG form). In (879b),
this is indicated by the third person reflexive pronoun.                         Note that
                                            Speech-reporting strategies   505this pronoun is controlled by the subject of the first clause (‘that
woman’),   not by its own subject (‘old man’).          This is a rather
rare contradiction to the general rule for the reflexive possessive
pronouns (see {4.1.1.2), which apparently demonstrates that such
constructions constitute an exception to the general syntactic con-
ventions (which simply do not cover “indirect speech”).

            ‘That woman knew that there was one oracular old
           man in her family.’ [K3]5.2. Indirect questions
Indirect questions can be either identical in form to direct
question-word questions (5.2.1) or contain a nominal form of the
verb instead of the Interrogative (finite) form (5.2.2).
    Basically, the indirect question serves as a reporting element
(complement) with speech act verbs and verbs of cognition; in
this case, it renders the “theme” of the reported speech or thought
(5.2.1-5.2.2). This syntactic pattern is also compatible with verbs
implying finding an answer to some question (5.2.1). In addi-
tion, this strategy can be applied to create correlative subordinate
clauses (5.3), although this use appears to be rather marginal.","[524, 525]"
"1.1.2.    Distribution of the Finite forms
The finite forms are used in one-clause (simple) sentences and
in main clauses within multiclausal sentences. The finite forms
are distributed over two interdependent functional parameters, the
illocutionary sentence type and the grammatical Focus.      On the
142      Chapter 6.   Verb morphology
one hand, neither the Imperative nor the Interrogative forms can
enter the grammatical Focus construction. On the other hand,
with respect to the Focus semantics (see 12.3), the Imperative
forms are similar to the Main forms, inasmuch as both can serve
as the single element within the scope of the illocutive operator
(narrow focus}. This property is manifested by the capability of
being the only overt element of a main clause:

               ‘Let them marry!’ (lit. ‘take each other’) [K1]
This is impossible for the Focus-indicating and Interrogative
forms. The SF forms and the OF forms are used only in the
nominal Focus constructions (Krejnovich 1982:204-216), that. is,
they constitute a finite clause only in combination with a noun
phrase in the Predicative form.”

In particular,    the Focus      construction         (hence,   the SF     or the OF
form) is the only option in questions with an Interrogative pronoun
in the intransitive subject function or in the direct object function
(Krejnovich 1982:232-234), i.c., whenever a constituent                         able to
trigger the grammatical Focus marking is questioned.

           what-PRED          bring-OF:28G
           ‘What have you brought?’ [F33]
Similarly, the Interrogative forms are used only in the context of a
non-Focus question word (277). General (yes/no) questions allow
only the Indicative forms (278a); the Indicative form is also an
option in specific questions           (278b).   Thus, an Interrogative form
(exactly like a Focus-indicating form) cannot constitute the narrow
focus of an interrogative clause.

described in 2.8.","[161, 162, 163, 164]"
"3.1.1. Question words
If the 8/O constituent is represented by an interrogative pronoun
or contains a question word, it has to be marked as the Focus
(796).

            ‘What, (kind of) fox do you need, do you need a silver
            fox?’ [F38|
This case is fully grammaticalized: the Focus marking is manda-
tory whenever a question word occurs in the S/O position, ie.,
not only in question-word questions, but also in dependent clauses
made up as questions (where the interrogative pronoun functions
as a sort of relative pronoun,     see 19.5.3), and in exclamatory sen-
tences with question words (see        3.3.1.1).
460      Chapter 12.   Nominal predicates   and grammatical   Focus3.1.2.    Narrow focus
If the answer to a question-word question like (796) is constructed
as implied by the question, that is, if it answers exactly that ques-
tion, without any reformulation of its presuppositions, the con-
stituent that “replaces” the question word is also marked as Focus.
The sentence in (797a) is the answer to the question in (793b) and
(797b) is the answer to (796b):
 (797)     a. met-ek — gon-te-l

               which is called sour-cream, of fat meat, of hare-fur
               blankets.’ [F31]
This environment can be subsumed under a broader category of
“narrow focus” clauses, i.e., clauses in which the S/O constituent or
one of its subconstituents is the only element of the assertion, the
remainder of the clause being presupposed and/or implied. This
environment obligatorily triggers the Focus packaging variant:

               ‘Having removed his soft bones, (they) fastened sturdy

Note that the notion of contrastive Focus, as employed here, is not
equal to the notion of the focus of contrast, as defined by Chafe
(1976). More specifically, the contrastive Focus environment does
not imply that the remainder of the clause is presupposed, i.e.,
the contrastive Focus is not taken to be a kind of narrow focus
(as in 3.1.2), The only additional condition is that the contrasting
                                         Semantics of grammatical Focus   463element is a part of the assertion (which is intended to rule out so
called “contrastive topics”).
      Thus,   the Focus packaging variant is compulsory          if the $/O
constituent (or its sub-constituent) represents the narrow focus
or the contrastive part of the assertion. Either condition is sufh-
cient for the Focus marking to be compulsory. Of course, the rare
clear instances of the focus of contrast, (where these conditions are
combined) also involve the Focus marking:
 (800)        el       met-ek   tat l’e-l     Comparna-k      tat l’e-l
              {NEG I-PRED} CA be-sF | {raven-PRED} CA be-SF
              ‘It is not me that is doing this, it is a reven that is
              doing this.’
3.2. Free Focus marking
3.2.1. Functions of Focus marking
If the scope of assertion comprises both the finite verb and the
S/O constituent (“broad focus”), and there is no explicit contrast,
Focus marking is not mandatory, i.e., the broad scope of assertion
generally allows both packaging options. In this situation, Focus
marking (in contrast to neutral clause structure) has a twofold
semantic impact: it signifies that the S/O constituent is a part
of the assertion and delimits the assertion rendered by the given
clause from the previously introduced information, i.e., the Focus
is always the first constituent of the sentence which is within the
scope of assertion.
    The role played by each of these factors is slightly different for
intransitive (SF marking)       and transitive (OF marking) clauses.
For intransitive clauses, the semantic difference between the neu-
tral and Focus packaging variants is appropriately approximated
as the opposition between clauses with the S participant outside
vs.    within the scope of assertion, i.e., Focus marking is normally
required to impose the so-called thetic, or broad-focus informa-~
tion structure (3.2.2).      For transitive clauses, this factor is less
significant, since the O participant is not the “default” topic of the
transitive clause {as it is the case for the S participant). Accord-
464      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusingly, the delineating function plays the major role in the choice
of a packaging option, i.e., Focus marking is applied to signal a
salient information-structuring boundary immediately before the
O constituent (3.2.3).
    There are two environments which suggest. that this distinction
is a matter of a tendency of usage, rather than of a strict func-
tional opposition between SF marking and OF marking. First, a
pronominal O constituent must be marked for the grammatical
Focus to be included into the scope of assertion. In this case, the
type of NP implies the “default” topical status and thus overrides
the difference between the S participant and the O participant
(3.2.4).      Secondly, the SF marking is not applied if the S con-
stituent is exactly the first element of a text, i.e., when there is
simply nothing to be delimited from. This observation appears to
indicate that the delineating effect is involved in the SF semantics
as well. This is most clearly illustrated by the structural difference
between text-initial and text-internal existential sentences (3.2.5).
   Thus, the general semantic impact of Focus marking is to
present the S/O constituent as the first element of the assertion.
Note that the compulsory Focus marking environments can also
be subsumed under this general formulation.","[479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484]"

Notes1.   The monographic description (Krejnovich 1958) is concerned mainly
     with the grammar of Tundra Yukaghir, with references to the Kolyma
     Yukaghir   materials   collected   by Jochelson;   (Krejnovich     1979)   also
     sketches the Tundra Yukaghir grammar.
2.   Note that if my description of a phenomenon         attested     by Jochelson
     and/or Krejnovich differs from that suggested by these scholars in more
     than the degree of detail, I usually indicate the deviation from the pri-
     mary description simply by “cf.” in front of the relevant reference, with-
     out going into the discussion of the controversy, in order not to over-
     load the book with details which are hardly interesting for its potential
     readers. However, if the differences appear to be significant, they are
     described explicitly.
3.   The examples from published texts are indicated by a letter (“F” for
     (Nikolaeva 1989), “K” for (Maslova 2001), and “T” for the texts in-
     cluded in this book) followed by the number of the text (according
     to the sources’ numbering). The transcription of Nikolaeva’s examples
     (which are presented in Cyrillic-based orthography) is mine. Note that
     a number of examples from (Nikolaeva 1989) contain some deviations
     from the published source, which reflects the results of discussing these
     sentences with informants; a reference to the published source has been
     preserved if such deviations are relatively insignificant (including car-
     rections of misprints). The examples from unpublished texts appear
     without any indication of the source, the examples elicited in interviews
     are indicated by the letter “I”.
4.   The materials published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1997 have not been in-
     cluded in the corpus of examples employed for this grammar precisely
     because I have had no chance to check them with other informants.
5.   For the same reason, I employ the examples cited by E. A. Krejnovich
     only in exceptional cases, simply because he normally does not indi-
     cate whether a particular example has been elicited in an interview or
     has been attested in a text. Furthermore, he mentions that he “con-
584    Notes      structed” some of his Kolyma Yukaghir examples on the basis of other
      data (1982:249); this method of cxemplification is never employed in
      this grammar.
      These percentages are based on data collected in 1987 by a joint expedi-
      tion of the Institute of Linguistics and the Institute of Ethnography of
      the USSR Academy of Sciences (St.Petersburg branches) and published
      by Nikolay Vakhtin (1992:50, Table 1).
      See (Vakhtin 1992:57-58) for a detailed description of how these ratings
      were obtained.
      In their reviews to an earlier version of this grammar,       Bernard    Com-
      rie and Christian Lehmann suggested that this system might. be more
      appropriately described as advanced tongue root (rather than palatal)
      harmony. Since a justifiable choice between these options could only
      be based on a thorough phonetic investigation of the phenomenon, I
      have opted for the term traditionally adopted in the Yukaghir studies
      (Collinder 1940:80-88; Krejnovich 1982:20-21; Nikolaeva and Helimsky
      1996:157).
      The voiced obstruent /Z/ does not occur in morpheme-final position.
      The final /n/ of the verb stem mon- ‘speak, say’ is dropped before the
      morph -d’e, e.g., mo-d’e ‘I said’, mo-d’ek “You (sc) said’, etc.
11.   The allomorph -j of the attributive marker -j# does not occur after
      consonants.
12.   The Resultative marker, the Stative marker, the copula 0-, and the final
      -o- in the qualitative and quantitative verbs are notably similar, so that,
      at least diachronically, they might be assumed to instantiate the same
      morpheme (see 6.3.6.1). Then, the phonologicaliy unmotivated alterna-
      tion /7/ ~ /d’/ is restricted to a smail set of morphological environ-
      ments. A further diachronic hypothesis might be that the morphemes
      constituting these environments used to contain a final sonorant, which
      triggered this alternation (see 3.3.1). This hypothesis is supported by
      Tundra Yukaghir data, where final /i/ of the Resultative marker and of
      qualitative stems like in (67) is still preserved in some contexts (Kre-
      jnovich 1982:98-99); sec also 6.3.6.
13.   That is why there is no special chapter on adverbs in this grammar.
14.   Krejnovich (1982:105) describes the forms of “degree of comparison"" for
      qualitative verbs. According to his observations, some nominal forms
      of the verb (referred to as Subject Nominal and Relative Nominal in
      the present grammar,       see 6.1.3.6-6.1.3.7) can signify a higher degree
      of quality, especially when     combined   with the nominal   Augmentative
      marker (see 5.6.1.2).
15.   See 5.5.5.2 on integration of Russian adjectives into Yukaghir grammar.
16.   Small    capitals denote   consonants   that can undergo   devoicing    after a
                                                                             Notes          8
                                                                                       oH
                                                                                            cn
       final voiceless obstruent of a stem, as described in 3.3.2.1.
 17.   In this sentence, the Plural marking on the verb is controlied by the
       Locative NP; for a description of such constructions, see 12.1.2.3.
18.    Krejnovich (1982:249) suggests that the A participant in Kolyma Yuk-
       aghir may get the Predicative marking as well; however,          his examples
       of this phenomenon contain detransitivized verbs (with the suffix -ze-,
       see §.4.4.2}, so that the Predicative marker is in fact attached to the §
       participant.
19.    For O marking in non-finite clauses, see 9.1.2.2.
20.    Krejnovich     (1982:253;   256)   observes a correlation between      the choice
       of -fe)k on the head and the presence of an attributive modifier; this
       correlation is in accordance with the functional account suggested here.
2i.    Krejnovich (1982:250-251; 256-257) considers presence vs. absence of a
       (lexical) noun modifier as the major factor which determines the choice
       of the Accusative vs. Instrumental marking.
22.    The combination ug+qo- ‘child+be-’ is apparently lexicalized with the
       meaning ‘be young’
23.    The verb inflection has been described by Jochelson (1905) and discussed
       by Krejnovich (1982:184-216). Krejnovich (1982:201-208), in contrast to
       (Jochelson 1905), claims that the transitive verb in Kolyma Yukaghir
       has the SF form in -i. This claim strongly contradicts my data, see
       (Maslova. 1997) for details and discussion. The absence of the transitive
       SF paradigm in Kolyma Yukaghir represents one of the major divergent
       features between the Yukaghir languages, as Tundra Yukaghir has a
       specialized transitive SF form with zero inflection (Krejnovich 1955;
       1982:209-210),
24.    Krejnovich (1982:149-151) includes the form in -m both in the Inter-
       rogative and in the Imperative paradigm; see /3.3.1.1 and 12.3.2 for
       Interrogative applications of this form.
25.    See 5.4.1.3, 12.2 for further examples and discussion.
26.    This is a clear point of divergence between Kolyma and Tundra Yuk-
       aghir.   In the latter, the affirmative pre-verb is employed        much       more
       frequently and can be analyzed as Predicate Focus marker                (Maslova
       1989; Comrie 1992; Fortescue 1996).
27.    The -ge- ~ -h- ~ -j- alternation in the third person Conditional DS con-
       verbs instantiates the same morphophonemic rule as the alternation of
       the Accusative marker after the Possessive marker (see 5.1.3}; in fact,
       the Accusative marker may          be assumed   to have   developed     from    the
       generic locative marker.
28.    According to Krejnovich (1982:167), the forms in -l-ge(ne) are used with
       the singular subject and the forms in -l-u-ke(ne) express the plurality
       of subject. This correlation is not confirmed by my data. The form in
586    Notes      -l-u-ge(ne) is absent from the paradigm presented by Krejnovich.
29.   Normally, the controlling clause is the next clause of a chain. See 1.1.1
      for further details.
30.   In fact, these suffixes might have been described as expressing Aktion-
      sarten. Krejnovich (1982:121ff) describes all the suffixes under discus-
      sion in this chapter as sposby protekaniya dejstuiya (i.e., Aktionsarten).
31.   It should be noted that the Result Nominal cannot. be analyzed as the
      Action Nominal form of the Resultative (although formally it might be
      possible), just. because the Resultative formation can be applied to a se-
      mantically restricted class of verbs (see 3.6.2), while the Result Nominal
      form is available for any verb.
32.   In Tundra Yukaghir two variants of the regular causative suffix, -s- and
      -se-, are distributed according to the general morphophonemic rule de-
      scribed in 3.3.4.1 (see Krejnovich 1982:68,; Maslova 1993:273).
      See 9.3.1.2.3 on the /d’/ ~ /n/ alternation.
      My informants seemed to be able to construct the form by attaching
      the nominal Instrumental marker to a pronominal stem, but not to use
      it, and it does not occur in texts.
      Here the Free Possessive form functions as a nominal modifier (see 8.2.1
      on this construction).
      Notably, this nominalizer was rendered as -bon by W.Jochelson      (1900),
      which makes it possible to posit the original form *bgn.
      This meaning is rendered by the noun kgnme ‘mate; the other’.
      In one example in [F9], the temporal demonstrative form tude appears
      to be used as a noun modifier (‘former’), see (571b). Since there are
      no other examples of this sort, this phenomenon is not discussed in the
      grammar.
      In this chapter,   the internal structure of complex NPs is indicated by
      angle brackets in the interlinear gloss.
      The Possessive Attributive marking (2.3.2) constitutes an exception to
      this rule.
      In this chapter, two separate referential entities invoked by an NP with
      nominal modifier are called ""Possessor” and *Possessed”, independently
      of the exact semantics of the relation between them.
      This is about the hero of a fairy-tale who has a bubble for a head, and
      that is why his name is Bubblehead.
      The thing is a straw and a worm at the same time.
      This rule does not cover the cases of pronominal Possessive marking, as
      described in 2.2.1.1.
      This meaning is not ruled out by cultural knowledge, since polygamy
      used to be allowed in the Yukaghir tribes.
      As described in 2.1.2, the construction is ambiguous between the posses-
                                                                        Notes   587      sive and the apposition interpretations, so the reading ‘the small goose’s
      daughter’ is also possible.
      This formulation does not take into account the possessive use of the
      zero marking, since in this case Attributive marking is not an option.
      This option was suggested to me by Bernard Comrie.
      Note that the Comitative markers in this example introduce the sec-
      ondary participant of a reciprocal situation (see 9.2.8}; two Comitative
      participants are conjoined by the connective adverb.
      See Note 127.
      In this chapter, the core participant. roles are shown by indexes A and O
      in the interlincar gloss unless they are recoverable from the case marking.
      See 5.4.1.6 on the semantic difference between the Accusative proper
      and the O-marking Instrumental
      This phenomenon was described by Krejnovich as “quasi-ergativity”
      (1982:232).
      I am grateful to Maria Polinsky for drawing my attention to this issue
      many   years ago.
      A special case not dealt with here is represented by relativization of the
      Possessor (see 1.3.1.4 for details).
56.   This meaning is impossible for Nominal clauses, simply because the head
      denotes a situation (not a countable referential entity).
57.   Note that this property is similar to topicality in Givén’s sense (i.e., topic
      continuity and persistence), with the qualification that the structuring
      of a text into episodes must be taken into account.
      The only exception may be the first and second person pronouns, which
      tend to trigger Accusative marking in all instances, sce (609a)}, (612a).
      In my corpus, there are no examples of Neutral (= Pronominal Ac-
      cusative) marking of these pronouns with third-person A. It should be
      noted, however, that my informants do rate the Neutral option gram-
      matical in such cases. Apart from this, the Accusative marking of the
      first and second person pronouns can be vicwed as an instantiation of
      the more general rule suggested here, insofar as they tend to refer to the
      most prominent entities in any episode they occur.
59.   An entity is taken to “occur” in some clause if it is involved in the
      situation being described, independently of whether: it is represented by
      an overt, NP within that clause.
60.   Note that the Accusative NP in such examples may represent the O
      constituent of the finite clause, cf. 10.1.3.1, 26.1.3.3.
61.   This property is shared by the Dative Experiencer as well (see 2.7.1).
62.   To be more precise, there is no convincing way to draw the distinc-
      tion between a sequence of independent clauses and a sentence built by
      juxtaposition of finite clauses.
588    Notes 63,   The term “clause conjunction” is used here to refer to any syntactic link
       between two or more clauses all of which have the same illocutionary
       function.
64,    In the latter function, it is opposed to specialized adverbial clauses, a
       relatively minor strategy for clausal modification of propositions (see
       11.4, 13.5.3.1).
       Some deviations from the strictly subject-oriented switch-reference pro-
       cedure are described in 14.1.3).
       “Perch” is interpreted as a proper name within the context of this fairy
       tale, hence the Nominative form in the Focus position.
       In this example, the detransitivized verb ley-de- ‘eat’ is used despite the
       presence of the direct object; this deviation is presumably entailed by
       the Desiderative suffix which is typically used with the detransitivized
       verb, but not with its transitive counterpart (leg- ‘eat’).
68.    The linear structure is posited for the DS clause and the controlling
       finite clause. The relation between the SS clause and the DS clause is
       more appropriately described in terms of nesting, see 2.4.2 for a further
       discussion of such examples.
69.    In this example, the underlined NP fills the Ablative slot of the verb
       londe- ‘separate (from)’, which is absent from the pattern of the verb
       paja- ‘carry’.
70.    Note that this application of the ordinary chaining is possible only under
       the specific mode of reference (1.2).
71.    This function appears to be fairly typical for sentence-initial temporal
       clauses across languages (Thompson and Longacre 1985:212).
72.    See 12.2.4 for a description of $s-chains with shared Focus.
73.    The     glosses for predictive conditional   constructions   are based on the
       context, as well on (Russian) translations provided by informants.
74.    In this example, the controller of switch reference is the Possessor of the
       finite-clause subject, see 14.1.3.2 for a description of this phenomenon.
75.    This example is one of very few exceptions from the rule of switch ref-
       erence: the DS form is used despite the shared subject.
76.    The term “complementation” refers to constructions where a clause de-
       noting a situation or fact fills a valence slot of the main verb (Noonan
       1985:42). Note that two of the three nominal verb forms employed
       for complementation, the Result Nominal (6.1.3.4) and the Prospective
       Nominal (6.1.3.5), can denote entities as well. In this case, they func-
       tion like ordinary NPs and can appear in a clause independently of the
       valence properties of the main verb. Such constructions are outside the
       scope of this section.
77.    However, see 2.2 for a group of verbs taking the Supine complements.
78.    This is the only type of phase verb existing in Yukaghir: other phase
                                                                           Notes      589      meanings are expressed morphologically {see 6.3).           See also 2.1 for an
      alternative complementation pattern for the verbs of termination.
79.   Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-to-
      subject raising.
80.   Note that the nominal complement of an intransitive verb of termina-
      tion fills the S slot of the matrix clause; in the pattern with converb, this
      slot is filled by the primary participant of the complement clause situ-
      ation. Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-
      to-subject raising.
81.   See 9.2.7.2.3 for the alternative pattern for the verb erd’- ‘want’.
82.   The Applicative may be thus taken as a morphological marking of the
      subject-to-object or object-to-object raising.
83.   There is a single interview example of relativization of the Dative con-
      stituent   (with the Passive Attributive     form,   see 6.1.3.3),   yet there is
      no text evidence confirming this possibility. It should be noted that the
      relativization of constituents other than core participants belongs to the
      class of phenomena, which do not lend themselves to reliable “interview”
      investigation, at least not in the case of Yukaghir; the only thing which
      can be said is that such constructions are not produced readily and are
      not attested in texts. No statements of absolute grammatical constraints
      can be made; yet even if such constructions are grammatically possible,
      they are far more “marginal” then Locative relativization and Possessor
      relativization.
84.   The only attested example is controversial, see comments to the sentence
      in (745).
85.   Note that in this example the Russian word svad’ba ‘wedding’ is used
      instead of the Yukaghir Action Nominal form n’e+mid’ul ‘taking each
      other’ with apparently similar meaning, which makes it possible to sug-
      gest that here this word refers not to the action itself, but to the place
      of festive activities.
&6.   Note that for same-subject situations, this meaning is expressed by
      means of the Perfective Converb, see 10.2.2.
87.   Otherwise, the causal relationship can be expressed by means of the
      Imperfective SS form; see 1.2.4.1.
88.   This property distinguishes a nominal predicate with the bound copula
      from the Stative form constructed with the same marker (see 5.5.5.2).
89.   Note that Predicative marking on the object is impossible in this con-
      struction, presumably because of the Predicative marking on the verb
      form.
90.   Krejnovich    (1982:208-209)   considers   this   construction   a part      of the
      Focus-marking system (for A Focus marking, which cannot be achieved
      by means of the regular grammatical Focus construction, see 12.2.1).
590     Notes       That approach is not accepted in this grammar because of significant
       differences in the role these constructions play in the grammar and dis-
       course. Most importantly, the construction with the Result Nominal
       is not obligatory in the environments which trigger compulsory Focus
       marking on the §/O participant (see 12.3.1); see also (Maslova 1997)
       for further details.
 91.   The “locative” pattern for predication of possession is presumably in-
       duced or at least strongly supported by Russian influence, where such
       a pattern constitutes the major option.
 92.   Note that a logically possible variant of dealing with such a situation
       would be to put the Focus O constituent in the clause-initial position,
       before the A constituent (which would have been then included into
       the scope of assertion). Yet this variant is prohibited by the word-order
       rules, i.e., this constituent order is not allowed in the Focus construction;
       see 9.1.5.1.
 93.   This ne can be assumed to be just the Russian negative marker.
 94.   Krejnovich (1982:151} gives the whole person /number paradigm of this
       verb, yet all forms but those of second person appear to be out of use.
 95.   In most instances these word order options cannot be distinguished (just
       because the subject is very often omitted).
 96.   For examples of questions to the $/O constituent, see 12.3.1.1.
 97.   Note that the phonological integrity of the complex gedo-l’e- is indicated
       by the alternation of the final /e/ with /a/ before the inferential marker,
       which shows that the stem as a whole belongs to the class of back stems,
       see 3.2.4.1).
 98.   The combination    el+juke can be fused into ejuke ‘not far’.
 99.   The interrogative pronoun kin ‘who’ does not take the negative prefix.
100.   This use of the manner question word is quite typical for colloquial
       Russian.
101.   Note that the possessive relationship between the subject of the main
       clause and that. of the subordinate clause is expressed by means of the
       bound (non-reflexive) Possessive marking (see (893)).
102.   Note that the verbs /’e- ‘be’ and a- ‘make’ can also combine with Inter-
       rogative adverbials to build questions to predicates (13.2.2.2).
103.   The omitted piece of the text represents the direct speech (what the
       brother was saying while he was crying).
104.   Thus, the grammatical Focus shows a predicate-like behavior; see 12.2
       on the syntactic status of the Focus.
105.   Thus, such a quantifier shows the same behavior as the grammatical
       Focus; see 8.3 on the semantics of this construction.
106.   Note that the comitative strategy of NP conjunction implies the single-
       event interpretation.
                                                                   Notes   591107.   This example involves an unexpected OF form in the first clause (the
       case marking and the word order indicate rather topicalization of the O
       constituent). Presumably, the narrator changed his plan: he was going
       to speak about karbasses, but then decided to mention that other people
       made other kind of boats.

"0.2.1. Finite indirect questions
Finite indirect questions are identical in form to direct question-
word questions; they are used as a complementation strategy with
speech act verbs (880), with verbs and expressions of cognition
506      Chapter    13.   Sentence   types and    negation(881), or with clauses signifying searching or finding out (882).
Most often, the indirect question takes the sentence-final position,
yet it can be sentence-initial as well (882b).
    Note that. the first-person form of the Interrogative verb can
signal either the coreference of the primary participant with the
speaker (880a) or its coreference with the subject of the matrix
clause (881b). The latter option is worth noting, given that the
indirect question cannot be viewed as a quotation.

The indirect question construction can be used to create adverbial
(5.3) and relative (5.3.2) clauses. In this case, the question word
serves as the subordinator, with a demonstrative pro-form of the
ta-series serving as the correlate in the main clause. This pattern
constitute a marginal alternative to subordination by means of
verb morphology (see Chapter 11) and appears to be due to the
Russian influence.","[525, 526, 527, 528]"
"2.3.3. Relativization and complementation
Relative clauses are built by means of the Attributive verb forms,
the Action Nominal, and, far less frequently, by the Result Nomi-
nal. The syntactic roles accessible for relativization are the subject
(11a), the direct object (11b), the spatial or temporal adverbial
(11c), aud the Possessor of the intransitive subject (11d).

 8.1. Purpose
The history of Yukaghir studies features the names of two bril-
Hant researchers, Woldemar Jochelson and Eruhim Krejnovich,
who have provided the basic grammatical descriptions of the Yuk-
aghir languages (Jochelson 1898; 1900; 1905; Krejnovich 1955;
1958; 1968; 1979; 1982). The Kolyma Yukaghir language has been
briefly described by Jochelson (1905) and Krejnovich (1979); the
former source          (which is apparently              best known   to the English-
reading audience) is based on the rich data collected by Jochelson
at the end of the XIX“ century (1898; 1900}. Krejnovich’s es-
say in Encyclopedia of the languages of Asia and Africa (1979)
is based both on Jochelson’s materials and on Krejnovich’s own
                                                 About this grammer   13data collected in 1959. Finally, Krejnovich’s last work (1982) rep-
resents the most detailed and comprehensive source of information
on arange of significant issues for both Yukaghir languages. These
works constitute the major sources of first-hand data on Kolyma
Yukaghir,’ which have served as the basis for a number of papers
dealing with some specific topics, as well as for typological studies
involving Yukaghir data. A detailed description of Kolyma Yuk-
aghir phonology based on new field data constitutes a part of Irina
Nikolaeva’s unpublished Ph.D. thesis (1988b).
   Thus, there is no book which might serve as a reference gram-
mar of Kolyma Yukaghir. Further, some important aspects of the
language have not been described at all. This grammar is intended
to fill that gap, drawing both on the previous descriptions of Yuk-
aghir and on the results of my own field work, and thus to make
Kolyma Yukaghir data available for further studies, as well as for
cross-linguistic research.”
    The grarmmar attempts to cover all attested forms and con-
structions of contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir; in this restricted
sense, it is intended to be comprehensive. It is clear, however,
that no single book can provide a truly “comprehensive” descrip-
tion of any human language, at least not at the present stage of
development of linguistics. Writing a grammar inevitably involves
making a number of choices, so that some aspects of the language
structure may be described and exemplified in more detail, others
only briefly sketched, and possibly some may be omitted from the
description. Insofar as such decisions have been made consciously,
I have attempted to write this grammar in such a way as to “let
the language speak”, rather than to force it to answer any par-
ticular theoretically pre-determined questions. In other words, I
have tried to concentrate on those constructions and grammatical
distinctions that, appear to be of importance in Yukaghir gram-
mar and discourse, rather than on those that play a major role in
current linguistic theories.
14   Chapter   t. Introduction 3.2. The structure of the grammar
This grammar has a rather traditional structure:      it comprises a
sociolinguistic introduction (Chapter 2), Phonology (Chapter 3),
Morphology (Chapters 4-7), Syntax (Chapters 8-14), and Texts
(Appendix 3). The lexicon is represented by two Appendices: a
Yukaghir-English vocabulary (Appendix 1) and an exemplified list
of nonproductive verbal derivational suffixes (Appendix 2}. The
Morphology is divided into chapters according to the classification
into parts of speech, which is introduced in Chapter 4. The further
structuring of each chapter is essentially determined by two kinds
of considerations, which can be called paradigmatic and semantic:
    Whenever some morphological items clearly constitute a para-
digm, they are treated as such. Normally, I start a description of a
paradigm with a listing of opposed items and their form(s), which
is followed by a semantic (functional) description of cach particular
item. If it appcars that some morpheme can be more appropri-
ately described separately, not as a member of any paradigmatic
opposition (this is the case for some derivational morphemes), its
form and meaning are treated together. In both cases, I take the
form-to-function approach, that is, I describe the meaning(s) (or
function(s)) of grammatical items singled out on formal grounds.
These considerations determine the “micro-structure” of the mor-
phological description.
    On the other hand, the “macro-structure” of each chapter fol-
lows the function-to-form approach, that is, it features such gen-
eral semantic categories as, e.g., “Aspect” or “Demonstrative pro-
noun”, under which various paradigms or separate morphological
items are subsumed on functional grounds. In practice, this means
that considerations of semantic affinity prevail over distinctions in
the grammatical status, in particular, over the opposition between
inflection and derivation. For instance, the section on Aspect deals
with all morphological means employed for expressing aspectual
meanings, regardless of their regularity, productivity, and the like.
This is not to say, of course, that such properties are not expli-
cated for cach item. Normally, each section starts with a general
overview of the morphological means it describes, their (formal
                                                  About this grammar   = 15and semantic) relations to each other, grammatical status, etc.
   The Syntaz is structured according to similar considerations.
It is divided into seven chapters associated with more or less tra-
ditional topics in syntax, as determined by general classification
of syntactic units and types of syntactic relations. The internal
structure of each chapter is determined by grammatical distinc-
tions expressed   in Yukaghir,   that is, the constructions are classi-
fied according to functional considerations, which helps to high-
light the contrasting features of functionally similar constructions.
On the micro-level, the description of each construction takes the
form-to-function approach: my aim is to describe and exemplify
various constructions and the meaning(s) associated with these
constructions.
    I believe that this combination of the form-to-function approach
to the description proper and the function-to-form approach to
classification of items into chapters and sections of a grammar
appropriately suits the objectives of this endeavor: on the one
hand, it provides a reasonable degree of accessibility of informa-
tion on the basis of rather general and semantically motivated
headings determined by the more or less widely assumed view
on what a descriptive grammar should cover; on the other hand,
on the micro-level it licenses a description of grammatical items
and associated semantic configurations, as they are attested in the
specific language, rather than mapping of linguistic constructs and
concepts onto that language.
    To be sure, at a number of points these approaches turn out to
be in contradiction, i.e., the range of functions associated with a
morphological item or syntactic construction crosses the “bound-
aries” set. by the general semantic considerations. There is no one
way to solve the descriptive problems produced by such contra-
dictions that can be applied throughout the grammar. However,
there are two technical devices which are intended to override
these contradictions: cross-references between the relevant frag-
ments of fhe grammar and special sections providing summaries
of interrelated phenomena treated in different parts of the gram-
mar (c.g., there is a summary of properties which identify the
16   Chapter   1. Introductionsyntactic function of subject in Yukaghir; since these properties
manifest themselves in various types of syntactic constructions,
they are described in detail in different sections of the grammar).
To sum up, the macro-structure of the description offered here
is determined by how I understand what descriptive linguistics
is about; in many respects, it follows such general guidelines for
descriptive linguists as Lingua Descriptive Questionnaire (Comrie
and Smith 1977} and Language Typology and Syntactic Descrip-
tion (Shopen 1985). The micro-structure is determined by what I
know of Kolyma Yukaghir and represents an attempt to describe
the language “in its own terms”.","[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"3.2.2.     Thetic clauses
SF marking is employed in order to impose the so-called thetic,
or presentational, articulation (Kuroda 1972, Sasse 1987), that
is, to present a state of affairs (an event together with the enti-
ties involved in this event} as a unitary whole, without analysis
into two “packaging” units corresponding to the notions of sub-
ject (topic) and predicate (comment).                Roughly, these are clauses
which can serve as appropriate answers to questions like ‘What
has happened?’. Thetic clauses signal some sort of discourse dis-
continuity, Le., the event described by a thetic clause does not
belong to any coherent chain of actions (Krejnovich 1982:214).

3.2.3. Delimiting function of the OF marking
A broad scope of assertion including a non-contrastive O con-
stituent allows both packaging options. The Focus variant seems
to be applied in order to contrast the assertion rendered by the
given clause and the previously introduced information, so that the
Focus NP identifies the left “boundary” of the assertion. If there is
no pragmatically motivated boundary immediately before the O
466      Chapter   12.   Nominal   predicates   and grammatical   Focusconstituent, the neutral variant is likely to be chosen. This strat-
egy of information structuring works both on the clause-internal
(3.2.3.1) and on the interclausal levels (3.2.3.2).
3.2.3.1.     Clause-internal structuring.                    If a clause contains 4 nom-
inal A constituent, two alternative information structures can be
distinguished: First, the clause can be constructed as providing
information about the A participant (that is, the A constituent is
taken to be the topic of that clause and excluded from the scope
of assertion). Secondly, the event can be presented as a unitary
whole and opposed to the previously introduced information.
   The first type of information structure is encoded by means of
the Focus packaging option (802). For instance, the second clause
in (802a) is intended to provide the relevant information about the
cuckoo (it was sent to call other birds, because it was a polyglot),
hence the Focus packaging variant.

               ‘In order to call these, they sent the cuckoo. The
               cuckoo knew eighteen bird languages.’ [F5]

               get.caught-CAUS:ITER-OF:38G}
               ‘The rich person was fishing ...’ [F46]
The second type of information structure is likely to occur if the
(transitive) event as a whole is opposed to some background in-
formation. A characteristic environment is the context of a con-
ditional construction (803), where the main clause as a whole is
opposed to the conditional setting (roughly, it can be conceived
of as an answer to a question like ‘What will happen if...’). In
this situation, the most significant information-structuring bound-
                                                     Semantics of grammatical Focus       467ary lies between the conditional clause and the main clause, rather
than between the A constituent and the O constituent of the main
clause (as would have been implied by Focus marking), hence the
neutral packaging option:*?

               ‘If you see that my coat is not fastened there, this will
               mean that I have killed this prince.’ [F50]
The     same    mechanism          can     be applied            to exclude     other   (non-
primary)       clause-initial constituents from the scope of assertion,
as illustrated by (804) and by the first clause in (802a).

initial, the same distinction operates on the interclausal level. The
neutral packaging option construes the main clause as a part of
a coherent information flow (805), while the Focus variant signals
some sort of discourse discontinuity between the Focus-marking
clause and the preceding one, i.e., the event is presented as un-
expected (806a) and/or implies a sort of semantic contrast to the
preceding material (806b).

3.2.4.   Pronominal          Focus
Focus marking must be applied to signal that a pronominal $/O
constituent is included in the scope of assertion. This marking is
needed to override the “default” topic interpretation of a pronoun
(which is implied by the neutral packaging variant). For example,
the second clause in (807a) is intended to provide further infor-
mation about some bird (the dropped subject of the first clause);
yet, if not for the Focus marking, it would have been interpreted as
providing information about the man (referred to by the demon-
strative pronoun). Similarly, both clauses in (807a) are meant
to explain why the speaker and his companions have come, not to
provide information about the referent of the pronoun (the son-in-
law), hence, the Focus marking of the highly accessible pronominal
referent in the second clause.

470      Chapter    12.   Naminal    predicates   and grammatical     FocusThus, Focus marking treats pronominal O constituents in the same
way as S constituents (3.2.2), that is, it is applied to signify inclu-
sion in the scope of assertion, independently of the factors outlined
in 3.2.3 for non-pronominal O constituents. The examples in (808)
show that the OF marking of a pronoun does not imply any sort
of discontinuity or contrast between the given clause and the pre-
viously introduced information.

The functional               account        of SF marking presented                     in 3.2.2 im-
plies that the existential semantics should obligatorily involve
this marking. This is indeed the case for text-internal existen-
tial clauses (809) and for text-initial existential clauses containing
clause-initial adverbials (810).

On the other hand, text-initial existential clauses without clause-
initial adverbials normally take the neutral form. The examples
in (811) illustrate the typical structure of the beginning of a nar-
rative: (811)    a. pulun-die     l’e-9          terike-n’-t.

            ‘There lived a family, an old man and his wife. (This

Thus, SF marking is applied only if there is some preceding ma-
terial; otherwise, the neutral variant is chosen even for existential
clauses, where the S constituent is “by definition” included in the
scope of assertion. This evidence seems to indicate that SF mark-
ing serves the same delimiting function as described in 3.2.3 for OF
marking. If there is nothing to be delimited from (or contrasted
to), as in (811), this packaging option is not applied.
Chapter          13
Sentence types and negation
This chapter deals with grammatical manifestation of illocutionary
distinctions (Sections 1-3) and negation (Section 4). Yukaghir
distinguishes Declarative sentences (which are not discussed as
such), Imperative sentences (Section 1), polar (2.1) and question-
word questions (2.2), and two minor types: Exclamations (3.1)
and Optative sentences (3.2).
    The verb forms used in major sentence types are described in
6.1.1; this chapter is concerned with syntactic properties associ-
ated with distinct types, in particular, their characteristic particles
(2.1.2, 2.1.3, 3.2).
    Section 5 describes the syntactic strategies of reporting the con-
tents of a speech act, including the attested peripheral uses of these
strategies.","[484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493]"

AcknowledgementsSince I began to study Yukaghir in 1985, so many people have
helped me in various ways or influenced my thinking about lan-
guage in general and about Yukaghir in particular that expressing
my gratitude in full length would constitute a book in itself.
    First and foremost, I am indebted to my informants: Vasiliy
Shalugin, Akulina Shadrina, Lyubov’ Dyomina, Ivan Dolganov,
Vasiliy Spiridonov, Maria Turpanova, and Elizaveta Dolganova.
Without their generous help, interest and patience, this book
would never have come to be. I owe the most for my knowledge of
Yukaghir to Vasiliy Shalugin, with his fascinating talent and in-
tuition, and his constant readiness to tell stories in Yukaghir and
answer all possible questions in the most revealing and insightful
way.
    Iam grateful to the linguists who helped me take my first steps
in linguistics: Juri Maslov, Nikolay Vakhtin, Alexander Volodin,
Evgueni Golovko, Vladimir Nedyalkov, Maria Polynski, Vladimir
Plungyan, and Yakov Testelec. Their readiness to comment on
my drafts and to discuss mysteries of the Yukaghir grammar can-
not. be overestimated.    [I am particularly grateful to my friend
and colleague Nikolay Vakhtin, who has spent many hours and
weeks teaching me what descriptive linguistics and field research
is all about. I would also like to express my gratitude to Leon
Stassen and Frederik Kortlandt for feedback on an early draft. of
this grammar and for their encouragement at the time when it was
most needed.
    My field research was made possible by the financial support
of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Soros Foundation.

   I would like to thank Bernard Comrie, Christian Lehmann,
Dafydd     Gibbon     and   Werner   Kummer,   who   reviewed   an earlier
version of this grammar; their comments and remarks have been
both helpful and encouraging. Some of them have been taken into
account in the final version of this book; others will doubtless help
me in my future research. Irina Nikolaeva has read the phonetic

help in preparation of this book.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"
" Terminological note.    In the syntactic chapters of this book,
     the term “Predicative marking” is applied to cases like (605)
     as well, that is, I will not make the reservations concern-
     ing Anaphoric NPs at all points where Focus marking is
     mentioned,   Similar terminological conventions are applied
     to other case marking options: the term “Neutral marking”
     refers to the second marking option in the list above (Nomina-
     tive for third-person NPs, Pronominal Accusative for first and
     second person pronouns). Thus, Neutral marking is opposed
     to Nominative marking, where the Nominative case is used
     independently of the person. The term “Accusative marking”
     is applied to refer to the third marking option, independently
     of the particular case employed.**1.1.2. Intransitive finite clauses: split intransitivity
The single core participant of a finite intransitive clause (S) can
either take the Nominative form or be marked as the grammatical
Focus of the clause. The latter option involves the Predicative
marking of the NP (5.4.1.3) and the choice of the sFparadigm for
the finite verb (6.1.1.2). These options are exemplified in 5.4.1.2
and 5.4.1.3.   Thus, Yukaghir appears to show a special (“Focus-
oriented”) case of split intransitivity:> the S participant takes ei-
ther Nominative marking {associated with the A participant in a
328      Chapter 9. Syntaz of the clausetransitive clause) or Predicative marking (associated with the O
participant in a transitive clause).
      These marking properties naturally give rise to the following
question: Which grammatical units (if any) can be associated with
syntactic functions (or grammatical relations), such as subject,
direct object, etc.; in other words, do the participant roles identify
the syntactic functions, or are these functions identifiable only for
a given packaging variant? To put the question straightforwardly,
is it only the Nominative (non-Focus) primary participant (A/S)
that can be identified as the subject of a clause, or is subjecthood
maintained for the Predicative (Focus) S as well?
   The former analysis might appear more plausible not only on
morphological grounds, but also on the basis of functional con-
siderations, inasmuch as some sort of topichood is generally asso-
ciated with subjects. It appears, however, that Yukaghir gram-
mar assigns the subject properties to the primary participant role
(A/S), be it the Focus or not, rather than to the Nominative (non-
Focus) A/S. That is to say, the syntactic generalizations of the
type cross-linguistically associated with “subjects” are to be stated
over the participant roles, without regard for the Focus marking.
Various syntactic constructions that substantiate this claim are de-
scribed in different parts of this grammar; see 1.4 for a summary
of this evidence.","[347, 348]"
"
2.2.2.    Verbs
Verbs fall into two major classes, transitive and intransitive. Each
class has two series of Indicative finite forms, for main clauses
which are neutral with respect to grammatical Focus (Main forms)
and for clauses with intransitive subject (S) or direct object (O}
marked for grammatical Focus (SF and OF forms, respectively).
The finite verb agrees in person/number with the subject (the OF
paradigm and especially the SF paradigm are less distinctive than
the Main one). The Imperative is expressed by a distinct series
of forms, which are shared by transitive and intransitive verbs.
Illustrative paradigms are given in Table 3 (for the verbs modo-
‘sit, stay’ and a- ‘makc’).
     There are Interrogative forms which are used only in question-
word questions in which the questioned constituent is not S/O (in
the latter case, the respective Focus-indicating forms are used).
For the first person subject, there arc special Interrogative person
markers, -m 18G, -ok IPL. The second and third person Interroga-
tive forms differ from the Main Indicative forms only in absence of
the (in)transitivity morphs -j/e)- / -m(e)- (e.g., (qodo) a-k ‘(how)
you (8G) made’, (godo) a-met ‘(how) you (PL) made’, (godo) a
‘(how) he made’, (godo) a-ni ‘(how) they made’).
   The verb morphology is clearly aspect-dominated; the regularly
marked aspect. meanings are Imperfective, Ingressive, Resultative,
and Habitual:
6     Chapter i. Introduction(2)    Productive Aspect markers:
       Imperfective  -nu-         a-nu-m ‘he is/was making,

       Habitual             -nun(nu)-        d-nunnu-m    ‘he used to make’
       Ingressive           -a- /-te-        a-l-a-m. ‘he began to make’
       Resultative           -of)-           d-l-o-j ‘it is made’
The only obligatorily marked tense distinction is Future vs. Non-
Future (the suffix -te-~-t- for Future, zero marking for Non-
Future), although the Past may be expressed through periphrastic
verb forms. The Periphrastic Past is built by putting the Subject
Nominal or Relative Nominal verb form in the predicative posi-
tion:(3)    Tense marking:
       Non-Future               a-™                    ‘he is making/made’
       Future                   a-te-m                 ‘he will make’
       Periphrastic             a-l-bed-ek             ‘(smb) has/had made’
              Past              Taake-ANH-RELNR-PREDThe verb is inflected for several moods;                 major mood   forms are
Inferential (the marker is -l’el-), Prospective (-moZi:-), and Irre-
alis (marked by a pre-verbal morpheme ot-/et-). There is also a
Periphrastic Prospective form made up as a combination of the
Supine form with the existential verb l’e- ‘be’:(4)    Major Mood forms:
       Inferential          a-lel-u-m         ‘he appears to have made’
       Prospective          a-mozZi-m         ‘he is going to make’
       Irrealis             ot+a-m            ‘he would have made’
       Periphrastic
       Prospective          a-din l’e-m       ‘he is about to make, is making’The verb has a rich system of various nonfinite forms. The major
nonfinite forms are illustrated in (5) by the verb SubeZe- ‘run’:

"5.3.1.    Correlative adverbial clauses
The correlative adverbial clause can have spatial (885), temporal
(886), or comparative (887) semantics, depending on the question
word employed.               The question word                godo ‘how’ can be used not
only with comparative meaning (887), but with temporal meaning
(886) as well.!°° This word godo ‘how’ can be used without a
correlate in the main clause, see (886b), (887c).

510      Chapter 13. Sentence types and negationif an indirect-question adverbial clause has spatial meaning, the
finite (Interrogative) form of the verb is often replaced by the
Result Nominal form, i.e., the indirect question strategy is mixed
with the morphological one (see 11.4.2):

5.3.2.    Correlative relative clauses
Correlative relative clauses are made                up as finite indirect ques-
tions, with the demonstrative pronoun tamun ‘that’ (889a)-(889b)
or a full NP (890) serving as the correlate in the main clause; in one
instance, the correlate in the main clause is the universal quantifier
(889c),
      This pattern can be used for the same types of relativization as
the Attributive relative clauses (12.3.1): for relativization of the
subject (889a), of the direct object (889b)-(889c), of the Possessor
(890a), of the temporal (890b) and spatial (890c) adverbial. The
spatial relative clause (890c) can combine a question word with the
Result Nominal form (cf. the similar effect in correlative adverbial
clauses constructed according to the same pattern).

Coreference             and       discourse         coherence
1. Grammaticalized             coreference phenomena
1.1.    Clause-internal phenomena
1.1.1. Participant reflexivization
The only explicit means of assigning two participant roles in a
clause to a single referent is the Reflexive marking on the verb,
which is described in 6.4.5.3, The controller of such reflexiviza-
tion is always the A participant, the target, the O participant.
Accordingly, a pronoun in the direct object function can only be
non-reflexive,
   If a participant other than O is coreferential with the subject,
the regular personal pronouns are used, so that only the context
can disambiguate reflexive vs. non-reflexive use of a pronoun. The
sentences in (891) give examples of reflexively and non-reflexively
used Dative personal pronouns. The sentences in (892) illustrate
reflexively used personal pronouns in other syntactic positions.

"4.4. Negative particles
4.4.1. ‘No, by no means’
The particle ktejen expresses the modal meaning of impossibility;
it is used only in combination with standard negation:

           DP       NEG-+live-FUT-INTR:2SG
           ‘There is no way that you will be able to survive

               he-DAT
               ‘They were not able to do him any harm at all.’ [T1]4.4.2. ‘Almost, only, hardly’
These and similar meanings are expressed by a group of apparently
related items derived from the stem mol-:(869)      moli            preventive particle (870)
           molin           ‘only’ (871a); ‘hardly’ (871b)
           moldo           ‘nothing but’ (872)
           molind’a        ‘hardly, almost not’ (873)
           molind’at       ‘nearly, almost, hardly’ (874).
The preventive particle molt is used only in combination with the
Future affirmative second person forms in sentences intended to
prevent unintended results of the hearer’s careless actions:
 (870)          towke    moli     aji-te-met
               dog      PREV      shoot-PUT-TR:2PL
               ‘Make sure that you do not shoot the dogs.’
The particle molzn           ‘only, hardly’        occurs only in the affirmative
Focus construction:
 (871)     a. ta        jug-de-ge      — irk-in          pulut-tege-k

               ‘They saw that he was hardly breathing.’ (lit. ‘There

                                                                      Negation    499The particle moldo occurs only in sentences with existential                      (or
similar) semantics; all attested instances of this particle involve
body-part nouns, i.e., the meaning of the construction is, roughly:
‘(Instead   of somebody)       there     was/was         scen/was     present    only
her/his body part’. The particle triggers SF marking on the verb:
(872)   a. terike-gi    moldo          amun   gqodé-l
            wife-POss   only     — bone       __lic-SF
            ‘Only bones of his wife were lying there.’ [F48]

            ‘They walked and saw only his head appearing from
            time to time.’
The particles molind’a and molind’at have similar meanings: they
signify that the situation referred to by the clause did take place,
but only with difficulty (or almost did not). Yet the former is
used in positive sentences (873), the latter, only in combination
with standard negation. In combination with the negation, the
particle marks the nonoccurrence of the situation as something
that barely happened,        i.e., the positive situation is presented as
having nearly/almost taken place (874). This particle is far more
frequent than molind’a.

Speech-act verbs fall into two groups. The first group comprises
verbs which can introduce reported speech but do not require the
reporting element to be present; it comprises intransitive speech-
act verbs (9.2.4.1) and their applicative derivatives which have an
O slot for the Addressee. The second group comprises the verbs
which have an O slot for the reporting element, transitive speech-
act verbs {9.2.6.2} and the labile verb mon- ‘say’.                    To be more
precise, these verbs require some speech-reporting expression to
be present, and this expression may but need not be represented
by an NP marked as the direct object. Thus, these verbs may
take an ordinary NP (9.2.6.2) or a regular nominal complement
(11.1.3.3)} as the reporting element.
      This section deals with syntactic strategies which are used pri-
marily for reporting speech, quotations (5.1) and indirect questions
(5.2). These strategies can also be applied, although infrequently,
for other types of clause-linkage (5.1.3, 5.3).","[517, 518, 519, 520]"
"3.   Accents   and   varieties
Given the small number of speakers nowadays, any notes about
dialectal or social varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir can only be spec-
ulative. However, the currently spoken idiolects are so distinct
as to prevent the best Yukaghir speakers from rating each other’s
language competence highly; Table 5 shows that not one got the
highest rating for language competence from any expert. These
distinctions, as well as the reluctance to acknowledge each other’s
competence, seem to result from two factors of language variation:
    First, the Yukaghirs currently living in Nelemnoye represent
two regional groups of Yukaghirs which used to exist before the
collectivization in 1931, One group roamed mainly along the Kor-
kodon River, the other along the Yasachnaya River. These groups
apparently spoke two distinct varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir. The
most notable phonological distinction concerned the labial vowel
harmony, which was characteristic of the Korkodon variety and is
24     Chapter 2. Kolyma   Yukaghir and its speakersstill maintained in the speech of some Kolyma Yukaghirs; one of
my consultants, A. E. Shadrina, a daughter of a Korkodon Yuk-
aghir, regularly labializes vowels in suffixes after /o/, which distin-
guishes her accent from that spoken by most of my consultants.
The same distinction was described by E. A. Krejnovich on the
basis of her father’s accent (Krejnovich 1982:21-22).
    Secondly, and most importantly, the Kolyma Yukaghir language
is undergoing an extremely fast modification, so that the varieties
of the language spoken even by neighboring generations are clearly
distinct. This seems to be a part of the survival strategy cho-
sen by the language in the aggressive sociolinguistic environment.
Each gencration faces a simple choice: given that their mother
tongue is not their first language, they can either reject speaking
that language and let it disappear, or simply speak as they can
(cf.   Vakhtin 1992:79-80).           So far, each successive age group has
chosen the second alternative. Quite predictably, the resulting
variety differs from that spoken by thcir parents in being more
significantly influenced by Russian.               Furthermore, it can be rated
as “corrupted” not only by the previous generation, but by the
speakers themselves. Yet, to some extent, this strategy of “survival
through modification” is approved by the oldest speakers, that is,
the speakers of the “purest” existing variety: they themselves do
use a special simplified Yukaghir-based jargon when addressing
younger people, just in order to be understood, yet to maintain
communication in their mother tongue.
    Now, it is clear that this strategy has been applied at least
since the end of the 19% century, which means that the current
group of “best speakers” used to represent a “corrupted” version
a couple of dozens years ago. Some of them are aware of the
differences between their own language and the language their
parents used to speak          (occasionally, my       questions were answered
like “I would say it this way, but my father would have said it
differently”). Even more so, they are aware of “mistakes” in the
language spoken by their fellow-citizens, hence low ratings of their
language competence.
                            The effect of language contact en Kolyma   Yukaghir   254, The effect of language contact on Kolyma Yukaghir
The most important contact languages have been Yakut and Rus-
sian. Now the contact with Russian is more significant. Russian
loanwords play an eminent role even in the Yukaghir everyday
vocabulary, e.g.:(13)   Yukaghir                                Russian
       terike       ‘wife, old woman’          starukha
       korobe       ‘cow’                      korova
       Sgstok       ‘staff?                    shestok
       uzzuo        ‘gun’                      ruzhjoNow Russian lexical items are being borrowed practically without
phonetic changes. Moreover, the borderline between the Yukaghir
lexicon and the Russian one is likely not to be “taken into account”
in the course of natural communication: almost nobody hesitates
to insert a Russian word into a Yukaghir utterance. In contrast
with this, the words borrowed earlier (like those given in (13)) used
to be changed according to the Yukaghir phonetic rules and gen-
erally preserve their Yukaghir phonetic form in the contemporary
speech,
   The instances of occasional code-mixing are numerous, cf. the
following examples (Russian grammatical and lexical items are in
boldface):
(14)   a. potomu éto        bogaty7-qo0:-t              gude-j
          [because          rich-TRNSF-SS:IPFV          become-INTR:38G

         ‘Because he became a rich person, that is why they used
         to go there and back (swarm around him).’ [F38]
       b. davaj    tude-gele    andt-na            davajz   kebe-sil’i      da
         INGR      he-acc       ask-TR:3PL        [HORT go:1PL             CONJ
         kebe-s alt
         go:1PL]
         ‘They began to ask him (repeatedly), let us go, let us
         go.’ [F36]
26      Chapter 2. Kalyma   Yukaghir and its speakers          c. hodi         numg-gin
             go:IMP      house-DAT
             ‘Go home!’ [F36]
None of the Russian items involved in these utterances can be
viewed as integrated into Yukaghir grammar and/or lexicon; these
examples are intended just to represent a possible source of contact
changes.      Yet some grammatical items of Russian origin are used
very regularly and can be assumed to have replaced their original
Yukaghir counterparts. One of the most notable examples is the
Russian intensifier sam ‘self’ (in various phonetic forms):
 (15)     a. sam el-oZa-nu-j
             self  NEG-drink-IPFV-INTR:3SG
             ‘He himself didn’t drink.’ |K4]
          b. tude-gele      kudde-m            tude-sam   aj   amde-j
             [he-Acc    kill-TR:3SG] [he-self    CP die-INTR:3SG]
             ‘He killed that one and died himself, too.’ [K3]
Cf. the Yukaghir emphatic form of personal pronouns marked by
the suffix -id’ie, e.g., tude-l ‘he’ > tud-id’ie ‘he himself’.
     In the most general terms,               the effect of Russian contact on
Kolyma Yukaghir grammar can be described as a shift from origi-
nal Yukaghir synthetic grammatical patterns to newly introduced
analytical patterns. In some cases, the new pattern involves a
grammatical item borrowed from Russian. For example, obliga-
tive modality is now expressed almost exclusively by a construc-
tion with a Russian predicative loanword nado ‘is-necessary’ and a
nominalized form of a verb (as in (16a)), which is rapidly replacing
Yukaghir modal suffixes (the old pattern is illustrated by (16b)),
e.g.:
 (16)     a. tamun       min-gi         nado
             that      take-POSS necessary
             ‘It is necessary to take it.’
          b. tamun       min-moze
             that       take-PRSP{TR:1SG)
             ‘It, is necessary /inevitable to take it, I should take it.’
                                         Kolyma   and   Tundra   Yukaghir   27Another subclass of these contact phenomena comprises various
expansions of Russian-like grammatical patterns construed by
means of Yukaghir morphology, which squeeze out’ Yukaghir syn-
thetic patterns and take over their functions. For example, Yuk-
aghir has a verbal suffix -7- designating movement in order to
perform the action denoted by the stem. This suffix can occur
cither in a finite verb form as in (17a), or in a same-subject form
dominated by a verb of movement as in (17b}. Both patterns are
being rapidly replaced by a construction with the Supine, similar
to that found in many European languages (including Russian),
eg, (17c):
(17)   a. tabud-ek   — jug-jt-mele
         this-PRED look-PURP-OF:3SG
         ‘He went to look at this.’
       b. ans t-ga-t                keure-s”
          |search-PURP-SS:IPFV] go-PFV:INTR:3S8G
          ‘He went to look for it.’
       c. ans’i-din    kewe-s’
          search-SUP go-3SG:INTR
          ‘He went to look for it.’
Although the construction with the Supine is hardly new for
Kolyma Yukaghir, it can be assumed to have been a marginal
device for expressing this situation type until recently. Now, it is
the most common and frequently applied option, while the pat-
terns represented in (17a)-(17b), having no structural parallel in
Russian, are squeezed out.
   Similar phenomena are found in almost all fragments of Yuk-
aghir grammar and will therefore be described in detail in the
respective sections of the book. In general, I will try to present
modern Kolyma Yukaghir as it is used in everyday communication
(that is, by Yukaghirs over 55-60).","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"
"3.2,     Qualitative verbs
Most words signifying qualities constitute a subclass of verbs (Kre-
jnovich 1982:97-112), insofar as they have the full finite paradigm
(116) (as described 1.2) and all non-finite forms, with the notable
exception of converbs for most qualitative stems (see 3.3 for adver-
bial use of the qualitative verbs).        In particular, these words take
the verbal Attributive (117) or Action Nominal (118) form when
used as noun modifiers (cf. (114)-{115)).

Besides being deficient with respect to the converb formation,
qualitative verbs have a number of derivational peculiarities; in
other words, they constitute a morphologically distinguishable
subclass of verbs (see 6.3.5.3, 6.3.6.3, 6.3.6.4, 6.4.3.3.2).@                 Yet
their major inflectional categories, as well as the verb-like Attribu-
tive marking, prevent them from making up an autonomous class
of “adjectives”.'°3.8, Adverbial use of qualitative verbs
A remarkable peculiarity of qualitative verbs is their adverbial use,
which seems to be directly related to the absence of converbs in
their inflectional paradigm. First, a number of qualitative verbs
derive adverbs by means of the suffix -n:(119)   éugo-                  >   ugo-n
        ‘be quick’                 ‘quick, quicker’
        omo-                   >   omo-n
        ‘be good’                  ‘entirely, very much’
        Gero-                  >       6éeru-n
        ‘be quiet, slow’           ‘slowly, quietly’
        éomo-                  >   €emo-n
        ‘be big, great’            ‘very much’
        azo-                   >   azo-n
        ‘be early’                 ‘early’Cf. the following examples:
(120)   a. pon       azo-l’el
           it        early-INFR(3SG)
            ‘It was early.’

              ‘Once I got. up early in the morning.’ [K2]
Furthermore, some qualitative verbs can be used adverbially, i.e.,
to modify predicates or attributes, in the short Attributive form
in -j~-s’ (see 3.3.3):
 (121)   a. tet        gnme        omo-s’          ad-t         moj-k

              “You have answered our question badly
              (--wrongly).’ [F31]
Such a construction is absolutely impossible for ordinary verbs
(which can be used adverbially only in one of the Converb forms,
see 6.1.4).","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"1.3.4. Functions of the Result Nominal
The Result Nominal has an extremely wide array of functions,
including the result of a situation, the affected participant of a
situation, the situation itself, etc.

The Result. Nominal can be used to refer fo the location where
the situation has taken place (see also 11.4.2, 13.5.3.1 on the use
of the Result Nominal for Spatial adverbial clauses}. This use
is apparently motivated by the fact that the location is likely to
preserve some traces of the situation.

The Result Nominal form is typically used for titles of mytholog-
ical stories on particular issues of the world creation (in order to
indicate that the events described in the story have entailed some

The Result, Nominal can be used to express situations and facts.
In these functions, the Result Nominal serves as the relative-past
counterpart of the Action Nominal; see 7/.1 for the use of the
Result Nominal in various types of complement clauses, /7/.4.1.1
for its use in the Anterior          adverbial clause,         17.3.2 for its use in
relative clauses.   It. can also be used as a (nominal) predicate, see
12,1.1.4.","[172, 173, 174, 175]"
"1.3.2. Functions of the Action Nominal
The Action Nominal is completely noun-like with respect to its ex-
ternal morphology: it can be inflected for any case {289a)-(289b),
it takes the nominal       Plural marker        and the Possessive             markers
(289a}, it can be the argument of a postposition (289c}, etc,

For internal structure of nominal clauses, see 9.1.2.
150      Chapter   6   Verb morphology    The Action Nominal can express both facts (290a) and situa-
tions (290b), (289c), but the situation meaning is more common.

See {7.1 for a detailed description of the Action Nominal com-
plement clauses, 11.4, for the use of the Action Nominal in the

     Finally, the Action Nominals are used to build relative clauses,
i.e., the Action Nominal can modify a noun.

Exactly as was described for the Active Attributive forms, the Ac-
tion Nominal of qualitative verbs can be used to attribute proper-
ties:

See /1.3.1-/1.3.2 for a description of relative clauses with the Ac-
tion Nominal.","[169, 170, 171]"
"
1.2.2. Functions of the Active Attributive form
The Active Attributive form serves to build relative clauses (11.3).
 (281)     a. ja-n                      ug-n’e-j               omni

               [we-DAT god give-ATTR| land
               ‘the land that God has given to us’ [F8]
The Active Attributive forms of the qualitative verbs commonly
serve as simple attributes, thus taking over the functions associ-
ated with adjectives in other languages.(282)      kelluge-je Soromo              ‘lazy person’
           lige-je pulut                  ‘very old man’
           omo-s’e legul                  ‘good food’
1.2.3.    Functions of the Passive Attributive Forms
The Passive Attributive forms serve to build relative clauses with
non-subject. relativized participants (see 11.3.1}. The Attributive
marker cross-references the subject. of the relative clause.

             ‘the place where they have left him.’ [F31]
The form in -me can be used either as one of the agreement forms
(for 1SG or 2SG subject (284a)) or as a generic Passive Attributive
form (with unspecified subject (284b)).

1.3.1. Formation
There are four major Nominal forms, which have the regular                Nom-
inal paradigm (see 5.1):
   e The Action Nominal, suffix -i
(285)    joulus’”-u-l     ‘{a situation of) asking’
         ask-0-ANR
         kel-u-l          ‘(a situation of) coming’
         come-0-ANR
         pala-l           ‘(a situation of) escaping’
         escape-ANR
See 3.3.5.2 on the epenthetic -u-, 5.1.4.3 on the omission of the
final /2/ before inflectional suffixes. Note that the Action Nominal
marker and the SF marker are clearly related (see also 12.2). Yet,
in contrast to the SF form, the Action Nominal is complictely noun-
like in its external morphology and syntax (see 1.3.2, 9.1.2.1, 17.1).
Some Action Nominal forms have been lexicalized (sce 5.6.3.1).
148     Chapter 6.   Verb morphotogy      e The Result Nominal, suffix -of:

         come-RNR.
         leg-ol         ‘a result of eating, somebody’s having eaten’
         eat-RNRThe Result Nominal formation commonly involves the epenthetic
-L; see 3.3.5.1 for examples. See 5.1.4.3 on the omission of the
final /l/ before inflectional suffixes.

"
3.2.     Optative
There is a special construction which signifies that the situation
is strongly desired, yet the speaker cannot bring it about; in par-
ticular, the fulfillment of this wish may depend on some other
person(s) (855b) or be simply impossible (855d).                    This construc-
tion is built as the combination of the optative particle gonoho and
the Result Nominal form (6.1.3.4) of the verb. The construction
is subjectless; the implied primary participant of the situation is
the speaker.

A similar meaning can be expressed by the combination of the
manner question word godo and the Future Interrogative 1sc:
(856)     a. id’      tig     lebie-get    godo     keb-ej-te-m

4.1.1. Sentential negation
The     standard     sentential negation is expressed             by attaching the
prefix e/+ to the finite verb, as illustrated by (857) and many
other examples in this grammar (see also 6.1.1.3.1):

4.1.2. Focus and negation
Constituent negation (by means of the standard negative marker)
is possible only with the Focus constituent (860a). The scope of
standard negation on the verb in the Focus construction is confined
to the Focus constituent (860b)-(860c). Both types of examples
are extremely infrequent.

               ‘After being there for a short time, that old man began
               to sing again, dreaming.’ [K4]
This construction is in clear semantic contrast to negative marking
on the verb (cf. (861c) and (862a)) and to double negation, both
on the adverb and on the verb (cf. (861a) and (862b)).
 (862)     a. as’       elf l’e-lle                02          nodo   kie-s’

The negative marker is also attested with some adverbial pro-
forms, but in these examples               it entails negative marking on the
verb:
 (863)     a. tanide            eli qodo      _—_el-t gon-moZi-je

"1.3.6. Functions of the Subject Nominal
The Subject Nominal form signifies an entity which has partici-
pated or might participate in the situation signified by the verb as
its primary participant, or otherwise has the property signified by
the verb. This form can be derived only from intransitive verbs.
The only exception seems to be the verb lejde- ‘know’ (lejda-jon
‘one who knows, wizard’).
    The Subject Nominal form can be indefinite (303a), generic
(303b), or non-referential (303c); a specific definite reference by
means of this form is impossible.

sition tite ‘as, like’, to create a comparative adverbial clause (see
11.4.5).     This form can also be used as a nominal predicate (see

"4.1.2. The Nominative       case

the A participant (155), or the O participant.                  The latter use is
possible if A is 1** or 2°¢ person (156) and in a non-finite clause

The Nominative is used with Possessive noun phrases (158), proper

function (158) and in the Focus function (159), (160) (see Chapter
12 for further details on these syntactic functions).

The      Nominative      non-Possessive        form    is used      as the possessive
modifier (see also 8.2.1-8.2.2):(161)      pulut numge             ‘old man’s house’
           met terike and’e        ‘my wife’s eyes’

The Nominative case has some other uses which are described else-
where in the grammar: (a) argument of the copula (see 12.1.1.2),
(b) apposition (8.2.1.2), (c) argument of postpositions (7.3, 8.5.2).

The Predicative noun phrase is the nominal predicate (163) or the
Focus of a clause (Krejnovich 1982: 184; 232ff}. Only S (164)
and O (165) can acquire the Predicative marking (9.1.1.2; cf. also
Note 18). The Predicative case is incompatible with Possessive
noun phrases, proper names, and third person pronouns, which
take the Nominative case in these functions {see (158)-(160)).

               ‘I will give you a fox.’ [F52]
The Predicative marker has two variants, -lek and-(e)k, which are
formally distinguished only with vowel-final stems and in the Plu-
ral form (see Table 10, 1.4.1). There is a clear functional dis-
tinction between these variants which subsumes two interrelated
factors:7°
    First, the short. variant is used if the narrow information focus
(e.g., the focus of contrast) falls on a modifier, rather than on the
noun phrase as awhole:
 (166)    a. kukki        vosemnadcat’             nodo   azu-k

               ‘Wow, a very good person has come.’ [F15]

            find-OF:38G
            ‘Then she went and found traces of other
            people.’ (F54]
The relevance of this factor is indirectly shown by the fact that
only the short variant is possible in question-word questions with
a question word modifying a noun (cf. £2.3.1.1):
 (167)      godi-mie      pajpe-k               L’e-t-u-l?
            what-QLT        woman-PRED          be-FUT-0-SF?
            ‘What woman would it be?’ [F49]
Secondly, the formal opposition in question is employed to express
the distinction between the true predicative and the referential use
of noun phrases. The Predicative noun phrase in -iek ascribes a
property to (i.e., classifies) some entity.In other words, an example
like (165) might be appropriately rendered as ‘The thing I will
give to you is a fox’. The variant in -ek signifies the referential use
(i.e., the Focus NP introduces a referential entity); this is shown
by the fact that only this variant can be used if the noun phrase
is modified by a numeral, in particular by the numeral irkin ‘one’:

condition that A is third person (otherwise the Nominative case
is used, sce 4.1.2):

             ‘Your whip has killed me.’ [F19]
The Accusative marking is compatible with pronouns, proper
nouns, Possessive noun phrases and definite noun phrases (includ-
ing generic reference, as in (170a)); if a noun phrase is indefinite,
the Instrumental case is used instead (cf. Krejnovich 1982:254-255,
see also Note 21).
   There can be two Accusative noun phrases in a clause if some
kind of possessive or part-whole relationship holds between them
(cf. 5.4.2.2 for a designated body-part form).

The Accusative can mark the recipient (17la) and the addressee
(171b}, the functions most commonly fulfilled by the Dative case
(see 4.2.1, 9.2.4).

4.1.5. The Pronominal           Accusative     Case
First and second person pronouns have a special Pronominal Ac-
cusative form in -ul (see 7.1.1.1), which is used for the O partici-
pant under the same conditions as the Nominative form of nouns,
i.e., if A is first or second person (172a)-(172b), or, occasionally,
in non-finite clauses (172c) (cf. 4.1.2).

              ‘He has come in order to eat us.’ [F23}
Like the Accusative in -gele {sce 4.1.4), the Pronominal Accusative
can mark the recipient:
 (173)        met   tet-ul  = mer-uje-t                 ejre-din

              ‘T’l give you feathers for you to fly.’
4.1.6. The Instrumental case: patient-marking function
The      Instrumental   case can be used     for the O participant           if A
is third person (i.e., under the same condition as the Accusative
marking, see 4.1.4). This marking is incompatible with definite
pronouns, Possessive noun phrases and proper nouns (in these
cases, only the Accusative marking is available).

96   Chapter 5.   Nominal   morphologyIn most cases, the Instrumental O marking is applied to unmod-
ified nouns,”! since the presence of a modifier either attracts the
Focus marking (see 4.1.3), or implies definiteness and licenses the
Accusative marking thereby (see 4.1.4). This is rather a tendency
than a rule, since in a few examples the Instrumental marking is
applied to definite (175a) and/or modified noun phrases (175b).

            ‘Such animals are domestic (are kept by people).’ [F9]
Like the Accusative (see (170)), the Instrumental case can mark
the whole if some part of it constitutes the O participant of the
clause:

4.2.1. The Dative case
The Dative expresses recipient, benefactive, purpose, direction,

(178) for verbs of transfer of things (177) and information (178)
(see also 9.2.4),

The     Dative   marks    a peripheral       participant      that   is beneficially
(179) or adversely (180) affected (benefactive/malefactive):

In particular, the meaning of purpose is characteristic of the Action
Nominal Dative:
                                                       Functions of the cases   99(183)   a. jagte-lL-yin           gon-t

See 6.1.3.3, 17.4.4 for functions of the “frozen” Action Nominal
Possessive Dative (Supine).
    The Dative marking can be doubled,whereby the second Da-
tive (normally, the Possessive Dative form) is used to specify the
direction more precisely. The following examples illustrate this
phenomenon for a body part (184a) and for the Possessive form
of the AD-postposition al’ (see 7.3.1.1.1):
(184)   a. éul-e             juko-d’on-ben-die-lek

In its temporal use, the Dative expresses a span of time:

                   ‘The hare and the old man worked the whole day from
               dawn to dusk.’ [F3]
In one example, the Dative is used temporally in the combination
with the Russian preposition do ‘until’:
 (186)             do     ugujel-yin           = mie-de-7i
               until      morning-DAT           wait-DETR-3PL:INTR
               ‘They waited until the morning.’ [F36]
The Dative constitutes an element of some verb patterns (9.2.4,
9.2.6) and is used within the Body-Part form (see 4.2.2); see also
8.1.1 for its marginal use as a noun modifier.","[109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"
"2.2.3.    Shared finite verb forms
Two same-type situations with different sets of participants can
be described by a single finite verb. There are two types of such
constructions, NP conjunction and omission of the second verb
form.
   The first. type involves NP conjunction either by means of asyn-
deton or by means of the connective adverb tahzle, see 8.4.2-
8.4.3.1°°      Note that the ordinary NP conjunction, as described
in 8.4.2-8.4,.3, is available only if the sets of participants involved
in the same-type situations differ only in one slot. Otherwise, the
connective particle -de ~ -te must be used on each of the conjoined
NPs:

           they go? (= there are some).’ [K1]
The second construction type consists of a complete clause fol-
lowed by a clause without finite verb. The latter must contain
either the Focus NP (924) or the connective particle aj ‘too, also’
(925), or both (926). Such examples occur very rarely; generally,
the preferred option is to repeat the verb.

               water.’ [F9]3.    Connective         adverbials
There are several items derived from the demonstrative stem ta
(see 7.1.2.1-7.1.2.2), which can be employed to establish an explicit
link between two finite clauses (or clause chains). These items are
generally clause-initial. This link is rather loose; in fact, there
is no principled way to decide whether the resulting sequence of
clauses can be taken             to represent      “one sentence’.            Note   that the
items in question cannot be considered “coordinators”, since they
are occasionally involved in clause chains (see Chapter 10) as well.
    This section gives an exemplified list of such items with some
brief semantic comments.      e tahile ~ tacile ‘then, and’ (see 8.4.3 for its use for NP con-
        junction).

  e tat ‘then,         so, thus’.     Morphologically,              this is the Ablative
        adverbial pro-form (‘from there’, see 7.1.2.2.4). It can be used
        as a nonspecific connective adverbial which makes explicit the
        temporal sequence of events (‘then, so’), or presents the event
        described by the given clause as a part of a coherent sequence
        of events. This is the most common connective adverb (note
        that it is present in almost all examples in this grammar).(928)     a. parna       gahie-le       Sprile-s-u-t

Appendix 2
Non-productive verb derivation
This Appendix is intended to provide representative lists of verbs
derived by non-productive morphological means discussed in 6.3-4.
The meaning({s) of each item are rendered by abbreviated glosses;
each entry includes references to the section(s) in which the affix
is described. The symbol # introduces lexicalized instances of a
suffix.
     For each item (and each meaning), the Appendix provides a
list. of verbs derived by means of this item. Two ways of glossing
these verbs are employed:  1. The meaning of the closest morphologically and semantically
     simpler counterpart is given in brackets. If the corresponding
     stem is not formally identical with the derived stem minus
     the suffix, as shown by the hyphen, its form is also given in
     brackets; otherwise, it is not repeated.
  2. If the meaning of the complex stem is purely compositional,
     no other glosses are provided; otherwise, the derived verb is
     provided with its English translation. Note that qualitative
     verbs are glossed as English adjectives (that is, ‘dark’ and not
     ‘be dark’).","[554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577]"
"2.4.2. Transitive: V [A, O, DAT]
This is the standard valence pattern for ditransitive verbs, e.g.:(638)   tadi-       ‘give (third person Recipient)’
        kej-        ‘give (first or second person Recipient)’
        atuludaj-   ‘sell something to somebody’
        jan-        ‘send’
        kige-       ‘show’, etc.
Some examples:
(639)   a. met-in er-ée       ner-ek                 kej-nile
           I-pAT [bad-ATTR] clothing-PRED            give-OF:3SG

           I-DAT     sell-IMP:28G
           ‘Sell it to me.’ [F52]
The same pattern is characteristic of transitive speech act verbs:(640)   a. nilg-in        met-ul    el+pundu-le-k
           nobody-DAT     J-ACC     NEG-+tell-

               that.’ [K1]

               ‘Once, when a raven was flying by, she asked (it) about
               her children.’ [F29j
This is also the valence pattern of the Causative derivatives of
monotransitive verbs (see 5.4.3, in particular, 5.4.3.2).
      With ditransitive verbs, the Accusative can be used instead of
the Dative (see 5.4.1.4).              The following examples illustrate both
marking options with two basic verbs of giving:
 (641)     a. tat tintayn      adil-gin       tude   ma&sl’ug-gele        tadi-m
              CA that          boy-DAT        his    daughter-ACC        give-TR:3SG
               ‘Then he gave his daughter to that boy.’ [F15]

               ‘The old woman poured the food into the bowl and
               gave it to (the dog).’ [F260]

                                                    Overview of verb patterns   355         b. met      tet-ul       mer-uji-t             ejre-din         pugelbie-k

            give-FUT-OF:18G
            ‘T’ll give you some fur for flying.’ [F7]2.5. Patterns with Ablative
2.5.1. Intransitive: V [S, ABL]
Some intransitive verbs have a secondary slot for the Ablative NP:
(643)    pala-         ‘save oneself from, escape (from)’
         omolbe-       ‘get better, recover (from)’
         inla-         ‘become afraid of’
         ahidu-        ‘hide oneself from’, etc.
This pattern is illustrated by the following examples:
 (644)   a. godo     amde-l-get      —_ pala-te-jek?
            how      die-ANR-ABL       escape-FUT-INTR:2SG
            ‘How will you save yourself from death?’ [F31]
         b. tat joul’e-l-get            omolbe-je
            CA be.ill-ANR-ABL recover-INTR:1SG
            “That is how I have recovered from the illness.’ [K2|
         c. met     meme-get      inla-je
            I       bear-ABL      become.afraid-INTR:1SG
            ‘I became afraid of the bear.’ [J]2.5.2. Transitive:     V[A, O, ABL]

"1.4. Indefinite Pronouns
There are three types of indefinite pro-forms based on the Interrog-
atives: ordinary indefinite pronouns (1.4.1), negative quantifiers
(1.4.2) and free-choice pronouns {1.4.3} and three non-derived in-
definite pronouns, Ser ‘something’ (1.4.4) ile ‘some (of)’ (1.4.5)
and jen ‘(an)other’ (1.4.6).

These forms are derived by means of the markers +ere                    or -de

The Interrogative pronoun leme ~ neme can function as an in-
definite pronoun ‘something, somebody’ without any additional
marking:

the prefix n’e. The only exception is the negative pronoun nilgi
‘nobody’ (i.e., the negative counterpart of kin ‘who’), see (471c).

the Intransitive Main paradigm, the third person marker is zero

only exception is the Irrealis form, which is most often used in
combination with the Affirmative marker; sce 2.4. Otherwise, the
Affirmative marker can be used in order to emphasize the assertion
expressed by the finite verb.

 1.2. The Attributive forms
1.2.1. Formation
The Attributive forms are built by means of the (in)transitivity
morphs,      as singled out in 1.1.1:       the Active Attributive form is
derived by adding the suffix -j/e}, the Passive Attributive form,
by the same suffixes that are used for the OF forms (see Table
13). The Passive Attributive markers normally cross-reference the
subject of the relative clause.       However,    the form in -me              can be
used as a generic (“impersonal”) Passive Attributive form.                      Both
types of Attributive forms can contain the regular Future marker
(280), although such examples are rather infrequent (see 2.3 on
the functions of the Future).

             [you-ACC       CA back-DIR arrive-CAUS-FUT-ATTR]
             §oromo       oj-l’e
             person NEG-be(NEG:38G)

             ‘That place where I am going to put my seine has not
             appeared yet (=it is still under the water).’
The Passive Attributive forms are morphologically distinguished
from the OF forms in that they cannot get the modal markers
{that is, they cannot be marked for the Inferential, Prospective
and Irrealis meanings), while the OF forms have the full range of
finite morphology.

tails on the Focus construction and its formal relation to relative

"2.2.4, Structural implications of internal Possessive marking
Possessive marking entails some structural implications which can
be viewed as a sort of formal counterpart. of the referential auton-
omy of the modifier. The structural autonomy of such modifiers
appears to be somewhat higher than in the zero-marked construc-
tion.    More specifically, the controller of Possessive marking is
always an immediate constituent of the NP, or, the other way
round, an NP made up by means of this encoding strategy cannot
form a constituent of a “larger”? NP (see 2.3.2 on the Attributive
Possessive marking).
   This property manifests itself in the interpretation of NP-initial
demonstratives and quantifiers. As shown in 1.2, the zero mark-
304      Chapter &   Noun phrase and postpositional phraseing is ambiguous as to whether such an item is an immediate
constituent of the NP or of its nominal modifier; see (557). In con-
trast to this, internal Possessive marking licenses only the latter
interpretation, that is, the NP-initial demonstrative or quantifier
modifies the Possessor, but not the Possessed.
   For instance, in (574a) the only possible reading is the one
suggested by the gloss (‘a half of your hare’), while in the absence
of the Possessive marking the NP could have meant “your half of
the hare”). A similar contrast applies to (574a) (‘the wife of one
of his brothers’, not ‘one of his brother’s wives’).*°)

2.8.     Attributive marking:            NP y-ATTR4+-NP y-CASE
2.3.1. Simple Attributive marking
Attributive marking is described and exemplified in 3.5.1. Its se-
mantic impact is opposite to that of Possessive marking: it signifies
that the modifier is non-referential. In this sense, Attributive en-
coding also constitutes the marked option to zero marking, but for
another class of situations.
    More specifically, both options are available if the modifier does
                                                Noun phrases as noun modifiers    305not have a referent of its own, but can be thought of as an alter-
native conceptualization of the single referent invoked by the NP
(see 2.1.2}, e.g., a girl can be conceptualized both as a woman and
as a child (575).
 (575)   a. tintan     atag-un         pajpe-d+upr-pe                      pude

            ‘Children, let us kill our bull!’ [F29]
In contrast with zero-marked apposition (2.1.2), the Attributive
modificr need not serve as an appropriate conceptualization of the
relevant referent; it may just specify a property of the head ref-
erent. Thus, if the modifier does not meet this condition, only
Attributive marking is available (for clear examples of this kind,
see 5.5.1). This distinction gives a clue to understanding the fac-
tors that may trigger one or another option in less clear situations:
the Attributive form is employed to signal that the conceptuatiza-
tion provided by the modifier is not salient enough to constitute
an appropriate referential expression for the relevant entity in the
given situation. To put it the other way round, the head noun
provides a clearly more salient part of the description than the
modifier noun.
    The relative salience of the alternative conceptualizations of an
306      Chapter 8.   Noun   phrase    and postpositional phraseentity is to a large extent determined by the situation involving
that entity. A clear example of this effect is given by a mytho-
logical story (sce Text 1) with two major protagonists, one is the
king of a lake (or the lake king), the other, the king of a sea (or
the sea king). An essential property of these heroes is that they
are thought of simultaneously as natural objects (the lake and the
sea) and as personified entities (‘kings’). Accordingly, the narra-
tor employs alternatively Attributive marking and zero marking of
the modifiers (‘lake’ and ‘sea’), but never resorts to a simple noun.
The Attributive form is used in all instances involving some sort
of personification, cf. (577b) and the second instance in (577c).
In contrast, when it is clearly the lake or the sea (as a natural
object) that is involved in the situation, zero marking is applied,
see (577a) and the first instance in (577c).

               sea-ATTR+king                          say-INFR(INTR:3SG)
               ‘That was what the sea king said to him when he went
               into the sea king.’
Thus, zero marking is employed if, in the given situation, the
property signified by the modifier is salient enough to constitute
an appropriate description of the referent. Attributive marking
presents the very same property as relatively “marginal”.
   This distinction can be employed to signal rather slight shifts
in conceptualization of an entity. For example, in a situation of a
                                              Noun   phrases as noun modifiers   307marriage being happily arranged, the fiancée’s property of being a
“girl” is conceived as significantly more salient than that of being
“a small goose”, hence the Attributive marking in (578a). Once the
agreement is broken (the reason being precisely that the fiancée
and the fiancé belong to different species}, the fact that she is
a “small goose” becomes more salient, hence the zero marking in
(578b).

             ‘The small goose girl*® will not marry the owl.’ [F5}
It is not the case that the semantic environment of the NP always
explains the choice of marking option. For instance, in (576) the
context appears not to provide any clues to the explanation of
the speaker’s choice. However, the semantic impact of Attributive
vs. zero marking may be assumed to be the same, independently
of whether or not it is predictable from the context: Attributive
marking presents the modifying property as relatively marginal,
zero marking signifies that this property is “central” enough to
provide an appropriate conceptualization of the entity.” This as-
sumption seems to be justified by the general semantic properties
of these encoding options, as described in 5.5.1 and 2.1.2.
   Thus,     Attributive   marking      in    (579a)     accords     the   primary
prominence to the conceptualization provided by the head noun
(what is most salient is that some bone has been broken), while
zero marking applied to a lexically identical NP in (579b) presents
the body part where the bone is located as a central property of
the referent (what. is important is that ‘it’ has been attached to
308      Chapter    8. Noun   phrase   and postpositional phrasethe wings). Similarly, the construction in (580a) is intended to
stress that there are no bad things (= drawbacks), not that there
is nothing at all. In contrast to this, the zero marking in (580b)
presents ‘nothing’ as an appropriate description of what has been
left.

On the other hand, Attributive marking appears to be preferred
in NPs containing more than two nouns, see (581a) and (581b).

This preference may be determined by the need to disambiguate
the internal structure of the NP (cf. (556)), since the NP created
by means of Attributive marking can function only as a single unit
within a “larger” NP.","[323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329]"
"2.3.3. Subpattern with an Instrumental slot
A number of transitive verbs have an optional Instrumental slot;
its semantic interpretation depends on the verb, yet it is always
within the general range of “instrumental” meanings (means of the
action, see 5.4.2.4), e.g.:(635)   a-                    ‘construct, create (INSTR= material)’
        ajt-                  ‘shoot, fire (INSTR= weapon),
                                        threw (INSTR) at QO’
        éahite-               ‘paint, oil (INSTR= material)’
        éahite-j-             ‘touch with (INSTR)’
        Cine-                 ‘fell (trees); chop; hit (INSTR= instrument)’
        €oh-                  ‘cut (INSTR= instrument)’
        Colho-                ‘touch, push, hollow {INSTR= instrument)’
        el’ve-, el’iji-       ‘carry (INSTR= transport}’
        ile                   ‘frighten O with (INSTR= Stimulus)’
        legite-               ‘feed O with (INSTR)’, etc.

               brought.’ [K3]2.4, Patterns with a Dative slot
2.4.1. Intransitive: V [S, DAT]
This is the standard           valence pattern for intransitive speech act
verbs, like ann’e- ‘ speak’, n’ied- ‘speak, tell (a story)’, etc.
 (637)     a. met-in el+ann’e
              I-DAT NEG+speak(NEG:3SG)
              ‘She did not speak to me.’ [K2]

               ‘T’ll tell you (something).’ [F53]
These verbs signify just the act of speaking and do not require
the contents of speech to be specified in any way. They have an
alternative Reciprocal valence pattern (see 2.8).
                                             Overview of verb patterns   353    Note that the basic speech act verb mon- ‘say’ is morpholog-
ically labile, that is, it can take both transitive and intransitive
agreement markers. From the syntactic point of view, it behaves
rather like a transitive speech act verb (cf.       2.4.2, 11.1.3.3), ie.,
it requires some speech-reporting element to be present and does
not occur with the Reciprocal pattern.","[371, 372, 373]"
"1.1.4.    The Intensified form
The Intensified form is built by attaching the postpositional mor-
pheme zd’e to the pronominal stem. The form is used instead of
the Nominative case form in order to emphasize the identity of
the participant, cither in contrast to other possible candidates for
this role (439a}, or to stress that the action is carried out by this
participant alone (439b); in (439c), both factors are present.

           ‘She has secretly eaten the meat (=elk) that I have
           killed on her own.’ [F48]
Nowadays, the Intensified form of personal pronouns is often cre-
ated by means of the Russian loanword sam ‘self’. The resulting
form of the third person singular is either tude+sam (440c) or
tut-sam ‘he himself’ (440d).

1.2.    Demonstrative pronouns
1.2.1. Demonstrative             pro-forms       and their Interrogative counter-
         parts
There are three demonstrative stems (Krejnovich 1982:155; 237):(441)     #-         proximate demonstratives (‘this, the nearest’)
          ada-       separated demonstrative (‘this, that there’)
          ta _ distal (invisible) demonstrative (‘that; such’)
and the interrogative stem              go-      ~   ga- (‘which?’).    The       demon-
strative and interrogative stems show some (although not abso-
lute) parallelism in derivation of their attributive, nominal, spatial,
qualitative, and temporal forms. These forms are given in Table
19. This subsection describes only the morphology and syntactic
functions of various forms. For functional distinctions between the
demonstrative series, see 1.2.2. The Interrogatives are described
in 1.3. See also 1.2.2.1-1.2.2.2 for complex forms associated with
                                                                                 Pronouns   239particular discourse functions (examples (458), (462)).
1.2.1.1. The Attributive demonstratives are normally used as de-
terminers:
 (442)   a. kin-tek                tig      mino-le         ejre-t-u-l?
            who-PRED               this    raft-INSTR       walk-FUT-0-SF
            ‘Who will sail on this raft?’ [F9]
         b. tet-in           pas‘ibe         edin     jodolben     jolo-hude
            you-DAT          thank          [this     package         back-DIR

            “Thank you for having brought this package
            back.’ [F32]
         c. tudel     jobs                modo-l’el             tay     pulut

            ‘He lived in the forest, that old man.’ [F3]
In some cases, although very rarely, they are used as NPs, instead
of the respective nominal forms (pronouns):
(443)    a. tabun-get         tudel        edin-gele        Cumut
            that-ABL          he            this-ACcC       all

            ‘From that one, he learned all these things well.’ [F31]
         b. tay-gele           n’elbet-telle           n’e-leme-de-jle
            [that-Acc          skin-ss:PFV]            [NEG-what-POSss-Acc

            NEG-take-PRV]                 house-AD-DIR          go-PFV-INFR(3SG)
            ‘Having skinned that one, without taking any part of
            it, he went home.’ [F34]
The demonstrative            tay         in the Plural form is used to express as-
sociative plural meaning (‘X and those associated with X’). This
construction is most common with kinship terms (444a)-(444b)
and proper names (444c).

1.2.1.2.     The      nominal    demonstratives           (demonstrative    pronouns)
are used as noun phrases, referring to both inanimate (445) and
animate (446) entities.

The Nominal demonstratives are inflected for Number and Case
in the standard way (see 5.1). For specific syntactic and discourse
uses of the Nominal demonstratives, see 1.2.2.

case forms or in combination with postpositions.             Thus, it serves
as an alternative for the Locative (adverbial) Interrogatives:

Prolative — Directional; see 4.2.2) is fully preserved only for the
Separated Demonstrative         (448); otherwise,     one form is used for
both Locative (Essive) and Prolative meanings (449).

However,       there is one important                   exception:           as noun modifiers,
these forms occur both in the verbal Attributive form (451) and
in the unmarked form (452). In this sense, they can be taken to
belong to the small group of putative adjectives described in 4.3.4.

absolute time of the event (453) or to the temporal distance be-
tween two events (454). The form tane is obsolete, and the respec-
tive meaning (‘long ago’) is commonly rendered by the form tuda
(453b).

distinguished in terms of the distance from the point of reference
(in particular, visibility (Krejnovich 1982:235-237)) and in terms
of the control and direct availability for the speaker.
      The series in é- refers to most proximate entities and/or lo-
cations which are directly available to the speaker (for example,
something belonging to the speaker):
 (455)     a. te-gide    ejre-s’
              here-DIR_ walk-PFV:INTR:3SG
              ‘He has come here (= to me).’

               ‘That is why we have made this raft.’ [F9]
The series in ada- refers to entities and/or locations which                     are
not taken to be remote (in particular, they can be visible for
the speaker), but are not directly available and/or not under the
speaker’s control; such entities often belong or are nearer to the
addressee or to a third person:
 (456)     a. ediy      Cilge          met-in     kej-k

Finally, the Distal series in ta@ refers to entities and/or locations
which are considered remote and invisible to the speaker:
 (457)   a. tay     mémeé gol+l’e?
            that    bear  where+be(ITR:3sc)?
            ‘Where is that bear?’ [F17]

            want-CAUS-OF:38G
            ‘T want to return to the days of my youth.’ [F58]
The Locative demonstratives of the ¢a-series can be combined with
the item ejmz ‘across, on the other side’ (see 3.1.5.2 on its use as a
postposition; cf. also Krejnovich 1982:237). In contrast with the
simple forms, such combinations can be used only in the deictic
function:
 (458)   a. ejmi+ta-nide         qon-delle      izulbe
            [across-therc-DIR    go-SS:PFV]    tiredness
            kou-de-t-t
           g0-CAUS-FUT-TR:1PL
            ‘Let us go there and have a rest.’ [F31|
         b. ejmitta         jaga-nide           palatka-ge
            jacross-there   arrive-SS:COND]     tent-LOC
           gaqga-te-je
           arrive-FUT-INTR:1SG
           ‘If I reach that place there, I will be able to reach the
           tent.’
The nominal Demonstratives tugn and adugn can be used as deic-
tic subjects of a cleft-like construction, whereby the deictic element
is followed by a complete Focus-marking clause (see 12.2.3).
1.2.2.2. The anaphoric function.      The demonstrative pronoun
tabun is often used to pick up a previously mentioned entity. This
is the only way to refer back to an inanimate entity (459); for ref-
246      Chapter    7.   Morphology        of closed classeserence to an animate entity, a personal pronoun can be used as
well. Generally, the demonstrative (in contrast with a personal
pronoun) involves a certain amount of contrast. In particular, it
often refers to the entity introduced in the previous sentence as
the grammatical Focus:
 (459)     a. tay           pulut               nume-yin            gqon-delle      tude

               people.        Walking around in search of him, they saw

Moreover, the demonstratives are strikingly more common in the
grammatical Focus position than the personal pronouns (460); see
12.3.2.3 on the pronominal Focus.
 (460)         Euge-ge                gon-u-t                    nube-lek

               some vegetable roots. That. was what she
               brought.’ [F48]
The other Nominal demonstratives are impossible in this function.
                                                            Pronouns      247   The Attributive demonstrative toy (or, much more rarely, tiz)
can be used as a determiner when the noun phrase refers to an
aforementioned entity:
 (461)   a. tay      pajpe    atag-un      ug-n’e-l’el
            that     woman    two-ATTR     child-PRPR-INFR(3SG)
            ‘That woman had two children.’ [F7]

            ‘These hunters were pursuing it, but not catching
            up.’ [F34]
In addition, there is a complex         Attributive form   tin+tan     ‘that’
(Krejnovich 1982:237), which can be used only to refer back to
an aforementioned entity, i.e., this form resolves the ambiguity
between deictic and anaphoric interpretations of the Attributive
demonstratives:
(462)    a. tintay     atag-un      pajpe-d+upr-pe            pude
            that       two-ATTR     woman-ATTR+child-PL       outside

            ‘That old woman gave (him) some tea.’ [F19]
Krejnovich (1982:237) suggests that this form represents the frozen
combination of the Attributive demonstratives tin ‘this’ and tay
‘that’. In addition to this form, he cites a nominal complex form
tin-tamun, which is not attested in my corpus.
1.2.2.3. The resumptive function. The Nominal demonstratives
are often used to refer to an aforementioned event as a whole;
this function is particularly typical for the demonstrative tabun
~ tamun, yet tugn is also possible (see also 14.2.1.2):

ta, in particular the Ablative form tat and the Local forms of the

ing a clause to the preceding discourse (see 14.2.1.2, 14.3). In
this function, these forms can be glossed as ‘then, so, thus, that is
why’, etc.; the form fat serves as most semantically vague connec-
tive adverbial (it is therefore represented as CA in the interlinear
glosses.)

former meaning is most often evoked               in descriptions of weather

250      Chapter 7. Morphology of closed classes1.3. Interrogative pro-forms
Most interrogative pro-forms are derived from the interrogative
stem go- ~ ga-. e.g., godo ‘how’, godi-t ‘why’, gamun ‘how many’
(for more interrogatives, see Table 19); there are three other in-
terrogative words, two interrogative pronouns, kin ‘who, whose’
and leme ~ neme ‘what, who’, and the Interrogative adverbial
noyon ‘what for’. The Interrogative pronouns have the regular
mon-Possessive nominal paradigm (as described in 5.1), but for-
mally slightly different predicative forms, kin-tek and lem-dik ~
nem-dik respectively (Krejnovich 1982:234-235):
 (468)     a. kin-tek           jagte-l?

               ‘What are you afraid of on the earth?’ [F31]
The      Interrogatives      are    used    in     direct   and   indirect   questions
(13.2.2, 13.5.2) and in correlative subordinate clauses (see 13.5.3).
   The Locative Interrogative gon ‘where’ and the Manner inter-
rogative godo ‘how’ can form phonological complexes with the ex-
istential verb l’e ‘be’: gol+l’e- ‘Where is/was?’ (see 19.2.2.1),
godo+l’e- ‘How is/was?’ (see 13.2.2.2). The latter combines also
with the verb a- ‘make’: god-a- ‘What/how did {A) behave with
respect to (O)? (see 13.2.2.2 for examples).","[256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270]"

consider this construction a loan from Russian. An additional

transitive LPL marker -j, the intransitive third person marker -},

61.1.1, 6.4.2.1).
     Partly, these alternations are motivated             by the phonotactics,
since /j/ cannot be the final consonant of a consonant cluster
(see 2.2). This case is described in 3.3.1. In other cases, the same
alternations must be described as morphophonemic, since they are
restricted to closed classes of lexical items and/or morphological
environments (see 3.3.2, 3.3.3)3.3.1. Phonologically motivated alternations3.3.1.1.      According to general restrictions on consonant             clusters

3.4.2.1. {+E}-roots vs. {—E}-roots. Lexical morphemes fall into
two classes: some roots take the syllabic allomorphs of the mor-
phemes listed in 3.4.1, the others take the consonantal allomorphs.
All roots of the first class end in /e/ or in /o/. The latter option
is possible (but not obligatory) only if the first vowel of the root
is /o/, /o/ and the consonant preceding {£} is not palatal. Pho-
netically, the distinction between /e/ and /o/ is quite clear only

In most {+}-roots in /o/ the final vowel can be pronounced as
/e/ in stressed syllables as well, cf. [foro'mo] ~ [foro’me] ‘person’.
This seems to be impossible only after a uvular consonant.
    There are no phonological restrictions on {—}-roots; in par-
ticular, they can end in /e/ and /o/ {which makes it impossible
to account for the phenomena dealt with in this scction on a pure
phonological basis). Some examples of {—}-roots:

pul-n’e ‘with Evens’, kgnme-pe ~ konme-puil ‘friends’.
3.4.2.2. {4+}-suffixes. A number of non-productive derivational
suffixes have the form —Ce—, where /e/ can alternate with /a/,
/o/. Stems derived by means of these suffixes behave like {+ }-
roots with respect to the choice of the following allomorph. More-
over, the final vowel of {+ £}-roots and of these suffixes participate
in some phonemic alternations which do not occur elsewhere (see
3.4.3). Thus, the final vowels of such suffixes can be assumed
to represent the morphoneme {#}. All stems derived by these
suffixes will be referred to as {+£'}-stems. To illustrate the mor-
phophonemic behavior of derived {+£}-stems, each of the follow-
ing examples presents a verb in the Future 3sG form and in the
Object-Focus 3sG form (for transitive verbs) or in the 2PL form

"1.4.   On ethnonyms
The etymology of the ethnonym Yukaghir (alternative spellings
are Yukagir, Jukagir, Russian jukagir, jukagirskij) is unclear; this
is what Yukaghirs usually call themselves when they speak Rus-
sian. The alternative ethnonym Odul (Russian odul, odul’skij) cor-
responds to the Kolyma Yukaghir self-designation odul, the Tundra
Yukaghir counterpart of this ethnonym is wadul. Strikingly, the
Tundra Yukaghirs sometimes call themselves odul when speaking
Russian.

2. Sociolinguistic situation in Nelemnoye
According to a sociolinguistic investigation undertaken by Nikolay
Vakhtin in 1987 (1992), 29 Nelemnoye Yukaghirs spoke the Yuk-
aghir language, although it was the first language for only nine of
them, see Table 4.
   None of them spoke only Kolyma Yukaghir, all spoke Russian,
and all but four spoke Yakut. Table 5 presents some statistical
data on the degree of language competence among the Nelemnoye
Yukaghirs. It was assessed by means of expert ratings, according
to a seven-point scale, “1” being the highest (excellent language
knowledge), “7” the lowest (no knowledge of the language).”
   As shown by these tables, the first. language of all Yukaghirs
under 60 is Russian, although many have Yukaghir as their mother
tongue. The youngest. generation is practically monolingual. Their
native language is evidently Russian, which is the only language
used at. school and at the kindergarten. Yukaghir has been taught
at school since 1985/86, yet this does not seem to have changed
the situation drastically.
    These data give clear evidence of the extremely rapid decline
of Kolyma Yukaghir. Yet, one must assume that a similar socio-
linguistic situation was found by Jochelson at the end of the 19""
century (2.1.3), How, then, has the language been maintained for
                                                  Accents   and varieties   23so long? A possible hypothesis is that the language competence
of the middle-aged group is always underestimated by the eldest
generation and by themselves, and that when a group of speak-
ers grows older, they return to communication in their mother
tongue (Vakhtin 1992:79).        This hypothesis is supported by a re-
cent slight {but nevertheless apparent) rise of the role of Yukaghir,
due mainly to the global rise of ethnic self-awareness on the ter-
ritory of the former Soviet Union. As far as I could observe in
1992, many relatively young Yukaghirs (of about 45-50} seemed
to have “recalled” their mother tongue, which they had pretended
not to speak at all in 1987, and now spoke Yukaghir with their el-
der fellow-citizens rather often. This “regressive shift” apparently
indicates that the language competence of the middle-aged group
is actually higher than was assessed in 1987. However, the dif-
ferent generations clearly spcak distinct varieties of the language:
generally, the younger the speaker, the more notable contact phe-
nomena in their language (see Section 3 on age-defined varieties,
Section 4 on the effect of language contact on Kolyma Yukaghir).","[41, 42, 43]"
"1.2. Non-finite clauses
The case marking of the core participants in non-finite clause dif-
fers from that outlined above for finite clauses:      e Focus marking is impossible in non-finite clauses.
      e The primary participants of Nominal and Attributive relative
        clauses are encoded as Possessive modifiers (see 1.2.1).
      e Neutral O marking in non-finite clause is compatible with the
        third person A participant, under pragmatic conditions which
        can be formulated in terms of oppositions between global and
        local participants (1.2.2).

The primary (A/S) participant of a Nominal clause (see {1.1 and
11.3.2) or an Attributive relative clause (11.3.1) is encoded as the
Possessive modifier of the head NP, that is, of the Nominal verb
form or the relativized NP respectively.°°> Since non-pronominal
Possessive modifiers always take the Nominative (unmarked) form
(see 8.2.1.1, 8.2.2), the case form of a noun cannot reflect this
property. Therefore, Possessive A/S marking is manifested only
by the following features:
  e Third-person pronouns take the possessive (unmarked) form
    and are used reflexively, i.e., according to the general rule
        for Possessive modifiers of NPs (7.1.1.2), see examples (606a)
        and (607a).
  e The A/S participant (different from that of the matrix clause)
    can be cross-referenced on the head NP by the Possessive
    marker. The sentences in (606b), (607b) illustrate pronom-
    inal Possessive marking, and the sentences in (606c), (607c)
        illustrate internal Possessive marking                  (see 8.2.2.1 for a de
        scription of this distinction).
  e The Plural marker on the head may indicate either the plural-
        ity of the relativized NP (607b)”* or the plurality of the S/A-
        participant of the Nominal (606c) or relative clause (607c),
        or both; see 5.3.2.3.

In contrast to the finite clause (see 1.1.1), Neutral O marking in
non-finite clauses is compatible with a third person A participant.
Thus, the variability between Neutral and Accusative O marking
is not fully accounted for in terms of the person of A. Differential
O marking appears to correlate with the relative prominence of
the core participants outside the given clause, i.e., in some higher-
level text unit. More specifically, Neutral marking is available if
the A participant is conceived of as a salient element of a more
global text unit than the O participant, according to the following
tentative hierarchy: clause < episode < text.”
1.2.2.1.    Variability of O-marking.                Exactly as in finite clauses,
Neutral      O marking is the only option when A                      is first or second
person:

              ‘When I close my eyes in the darkness, I can see.’ [F31]
Differential O marking in clauses with third person A is illustrated
by the pairs of examples in (609)-(612) for various types of non-
finite clauses. In each pair of examples, the sentence in (a) illus-
trates the Accusative option, and the sentence in (b) illustrates the
Neutral option. These examples are intended to demonstrate that
there is no strict syntactic rule which governs the choice of one or
another option; see the examples in (611), where there seems to
be just no semantic or structural difference between the (a) and
(b)-sentences which         could    account       for the differing O marking.
Neither can the differential              O marking be explained in terms of
semantic or pragmatic properties of the NP                       (as attested in some
332      Chapter 9. Syntax of the clauseother languages).         In particular, Neutral marking may occur with
highly “individuated” and referential NPs; see (611b), (613c).**

clause represents the unique occurrence of some entity in the cur-

              ‘Look for the shaman who has eaten my girl! ’ [F44]
See also (609b}, (610b).
   An essential point is that a local O participant may be pre-
viously mentioned in other episodes of the text; what matters
is its status within the current episode. For instance, the sen-
tence in (613c)-starts an episode describing a struggle between
two shamans (one who has eaten the girl and the other to whom
the request in (613c) is addressed), an episode in which the girl
herself does not play any role (although she is the main figure of
one of the previous episodes).            In (614b) the O participant has a
pronominal modifier tintay ‘that, aforementioned’ which indicates
that the participant plays a role in a previous episode; however,
it is its single occurrence within the current episode, hence the
Neutral marking.
      In all instances of the local O participant, the A participant
represents a continuous and/or persistent entity, that is, it does
occur in other clauses of the same episode, either within (as in
(613)) or outside (as in (614)) the given sentence. For instance,
in (614a) the A participant is not shared by the finite clause,
but nonetheless represents a prominent participant in the episode.
Similarly, the sentence in (614b) belongs to a piece of text which
describes a series of actions carried out by the A participant of
the non-finite clause, cach involving another set of non-primary
participants. Hence, the core participants have differing statuses
within the episode, although the difference is not observable on
the sentence level.

clauses of the same episode,®® both marking options are available.
For Neutral O marking to be possible, the A participant must
represent a more prominent and persistent figure of the episode or
of the text as a whole.
   For instance, in each sentence in (615) the O partictpant of the
non-finite clause is shared by the finite clause, but it is a relatively
minor element on the episode level, while the A participant is the
central figure of the episode. Apparently similar examples in (616)
instantiate another type of situation where both participants play
significant roles in the episode. For instance, the bag in (616a) is
a magic thing involved in all the events of the episode, while the
knife in (615a) is nothing more than an instrument employed only
within this particular event.

In (617), the O participant is involved in the relative clause only,
but it is a continuous and persistent entity within the episode, as
well as the main hero of the text (see Text 1). The A participant
plays a role both in the relative clause situation and in the main
clause situation, yet it is a less prominent figure of the episode
and does not persist in other episodes of the text. This situation
triggers Accusative marking.

Note that Neutral O marking does not require the A participant
to be shared by other clauses of the sentence.                    For instance, in
(612b) the O participant occurs in both clauses of the chain, the
A participant being involved in the non-finite clause only. Fur-
thermore, the O participant is a salient element of the episode (in
which the hero has to follow the way indicated by the hatchet);
yet the A participant is more “global”, being the main figure both
of the episode and of the text, hence the Neutral marking.
   This evidence seems to indicate that Neutral O marking in the
non-finite clause is available only if the A participant of that clause
is a more “global” entity, either on the episode level (see 1.2.2.2)
or on the text level. If the O participant is a more (or equally)
prominent entity both on the episode and on the text levels, it is
likely to take the Accusative marking.
                                 Core participants   and grammatical   relations   3371.3.   “Pragmatic motivations” for case marking: summary
There are four alternative mechanisms which are employed to dis-
tinguish the core participants of a transitive clause:  1. Focus marking. If the O participant is marked for the gram-
     matical Focus, the core participants of the clause are distin-
     guished by virtue of the fact that the A participant cannot
       take the Predicative marking (1.1.1).             This mechanism can
       be viewed as a sort of grammaticalization of the semantic
       affinity between the A role and the “topic”, on the one hand,
       and the O role and the “focus,” on the other. Various re-
       flexes of these affinities are attested in the grammars of many
       languages.- What may distinguish Yukaghir typologically is
       the especially prominent role of this association in the core
       clause-internal syntax.
  2. Person hierarchy. If the A participant coincides with a speech
       act participant and the O participant does not, no overt case
       marking is needed, i.e., the grammar associates the partici-
       pants of the speech act with the A role and the third person
       with the O role. Such affinities are also clearly semantically
       motivated and widely attested cross-linguistically. In addi-
       tion, the agreement marking on the v erb gives a strong formal
       support to this mechanism: the combination of a Nominative
       NP and a first- or second-person verb form accepts only the
       QO interpretation of that NP.","[348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357]"

trast to the past (see (376a), (379b}), For example, the following
sequence of sentences occurs at the end of a text describing how
Yukaghirs used to leave useless parts of killed animals in the for-
est without taking care of them and how terrible the consequences
used to be. As a result, now:

The Ingressive is derived by means of the suffix {-E-} (see

              skin-INGR-If the verb stem ends in a vowel or /j/, the Ingressive derivation
entails either insertion of the epenthetic submorph -/- ~ -1’- (381a),
or omission of the final vowel {£'} (381b):
(381)   a.    a-           >    a@-la- ‘begin to make’
              anst-        >    ans’t-l-a- ‘begin to search’

The final vowel is also omitted when the Ingressive is preceded by
an Iterative suffix, see (383).","[218, 219, 220, 221]"
"2.4.2. Consonants within the scope of palatal harmony
The velar and uvular consonants participate in harmonic rules as
well: the velars /g/, /k/ occur in front stems only, the uvulars
/h/, /q¢/, in back stems only.
                                                                         Phonotactics   37(32)       Front stems

The phonemic distinction between velar consonants and their uvu-
lar counterparts exists due to the inconsistent behavior of /7/, /u/,
multiple borrowings,            and a wide set. of productive suffixes which
are outside of the scope of harmonic alternations (sec 2.4.3). As
a result, the velar and uvular consonants can occur in identical
phonological positions, cf. the following quasi-minimal pairs:
(34)       nohe ‘thimble’                       vs.   ayagi ‘his mouth’

Labial harmony exists only in some idiolects (see 2.3) and affects
the phonemic realization of {£} (see 3.4.2.1). If the first vowel
of a root is /o/ or /6/, the final {£} of the root and of some
non-productive suffixes can be pronounced as /o/.

3. Phonological and morphophonemic                 alternations
8.1, Syllable-final consonant alternations
Final voiced obstruents /d/, /d’/, /g/, /h/ alternate either with
voiceless obstruents or with sonorants in syilable-final position.?
Since voiced obstruents are disallowed in this position, these al-
ternations follow from the phonotactics. On the other hand, only
a closed set of morphemes end in a voiced obstruent, and there
are many phonological options which can be applied in order to
avoid it in syllable-final position, some of which are apparently
morphologically and/or lexically restricted.","[56, 57, 58, 59]"

48      Chapter 3. Phonology3.3.3.2. After the Iterative suffix -uj(i)- (6.3.3.2), suffix-initial /j/
alternates with /¢/ in word-internal position, with /i/ in word-
final position       (the latter alternation resulting in word-final long
/i/).

          mezz-uj-s’e  mezz-uj-t ‘awake and fall asleep again’3.3.3.3. The Perfective suffix -7- (6.3.3.1), when combined with the
suffix-initial /7/, gives /é/ (commonly represented by [s’]) both
in word-internal and in word-final position, so that the Perfective
suffix is manifested only by the alternation /7/ > /é/. In the fol-
lowing examples, the presence of the Perfective suffix is illustrated
by the 3PL forms.

allomorphs of the /j /-initial suffixes, although there are no phono-
logical conditions which might determine the alternation.                There
are two notable formal groups of such stems:
     1. A group of stems ending in /u/,              which alternates with /i/
        before /é/ of the suffix, e.g.:

          inlu-l      in k’t-s’       ‘be fearful’     2. A group of stems ending in /ji/, /éi/, /jt/, /é¢/, regardless
        of whether such a string is part of a root or a suffix (73); in
        this case, the pronunciation vacillates, so that both /j/- and
        /é/-allomorphs are apparently possible.

       puge-s’       ‘(it is) hot’
3.4. The morphoneme {E} and related alternations
A number of Yukaghir suffixes show allomorphic variation of the
form   -Ce(X)-    ~    -C(X)   (below,    syllabic vs.         consonantal          allo-
morphs).    Basically, the allomorphs are chosen in such a way as
to create a sequence of the form {... — Cie — Cy — C3e —...} or
{...—C, — Coe — C3 — ...}, i.e, a consonantal morph is selected
after a syllabic morph, and vice versa (Krejnovich 1982:35ff}. This
phenomenon is deseribed in 3.4.1.
    Other suffixes, as well as lexical morphemes, fall into two
classes: morphemes of the first class attach consonantal allo-
morphs, those of the second class, syllabic allomorphs. The first
class consists purely of morphemes ending in /e/, /o/ (see 3.4.2.1).
As for the second class, there are no phonological restrictions.
Furthermore, the final vowels of morphemes which belong to the
first class and the vowel /e/ in the syllabic allomorphs show some
common alternations which do not occur in phonologically similar
morphemes of the second class (sce 3.4.3.1-3.4.3.3).
   These facts make        it plausible to postulate the existence of a
common morphonemic item (denoted here as {#}), which is in-
stantiated by the final vowels of the syllabic allomorphs and of
morphemes of the first. class.

This subsection provides a comprehensive list of the suffixes show-
ing the regular -C#- ~ -C- allomorphic variation. In the examples

"6.1.4. The suffix -b#- (Locative nominalizer)
This suffix derives from verbs            nouns    with    the general meaning
‘place where people (usually) do X’, where X is the action denoted
by the verb stem (Krejnovich 1982:88-89). In most cases, the
noun is derived from a verb marked for Imperfective, either by the
regular Imperfective marker -nu- (6.3.2), or by one of the Iterative

6.1.7. The suffix -ra- (-2a-)
The suffix -ra- derives a few substantives denoting various items of
the household. The suffix is compatible with nominal (260a), ver-
bal (260b) and adverbial (260c) stems. In addition, it is attested
in a few synchronically non-derived stems (260d).

words with similar semantics, e.g., logka-ra ‘spoon’ (Russian
tozhka ‘spoon’), kguse-ra ‘ladle’ (Russian kovsh ‘ladle’).
   The suffix can be also distinguished in a small group of other
derived substantives, which do not belong to this semantic group:
(261)   éine-ra               ‘a sunk part of tree’
        chop-DER
        408’e-Ta              ‘bubble’

        decayed.stufl-DER
        ugurée-ra             ‘poplar’
        ski-DERA small group of nouns are derived by the suffix -Za-, which can be
considered a variant of -ra-, e.g., S¢lien-Za ‘cedar bush’ (cf. Solie
‘cedar nut’), lemun-Za ‘a floating part of tree’ (cf.          lamut with
apparently the same meaning).
134     Chapter 5. Nominal morphology6.1.8. The suffix -(z)i’-
The suffix -(i}l’ derives a closed set of de-verbal nouns, which
signify mostly a typical agent or instrument involved the action
denoted by the verb stem, i.e., it has a meaning like ‘somebody
or something which does V’ (Krejnovich 1982:86-87).             The list of
attested examples is:(262)     éeké-il’               ‘foreman’

There are some other suffixes, attested in one or two cases each
(Krejnovich 1982:85-89); some examples:(263)     kgn-u         ‘crack, split’ (k¢y- ‘split, chop’)
          ind’i-rgt     ‘hand-bag for sewing accessories’

          im-ol         ‘riding deer’ (ima- ‘sit. on deer back, boat, etc.’)
          Sogi-je       ‘pocket’ (Sogi ‘bag’)
          ay-ur         ‘palate’ (ana ‘mouth’)
 6.2. Compounds
The only regular type of compounding is of the form N,|-ATTR+No.
As described in 3.3.1.2.5, from the phonological point of view, the
Attributive form cannot be considered a fully free word form (given
                                                     Nominal   derivation   135the possible alternation -d ~ -n under phonological conditions de-
termined by the head noun). That is why it is not easy to delineate
noun     phrases with   Attributive dependent   nouns     and compounds
based on the same structural scheme (sce examples (230)). What
has to be stated is that there are such collocations with the fol-
lowing properties (which distinghuish these collocations from those
described in 5.1.1):
 1. The meaning of the combination is not predictable from the
    meanings of its components.
 2. Before a vowel-initial stem, only the variant -d of the Attribu-
       tive marker is allowed; its alternation with -n is allowed (and
    required) only before a consonant.
 3. With respect to the Possessive marking, the collocation be-
    haves like a single noun stem, i.e., the Possessive marking on
    the Attribute (the Possessive Attributive form, see 5.1.2) is
    disallowed.
Some examples:
(264)     and’e-n-Sorome                  ‘pupil’
          eye-ATTR-person
          $a-d-abut                       ‘coffin’
          tree-ATTR-case
          and’e-d-abut                    ‘entrails, internal fat’
          eye-ATTR-case
          €olhoro-n-lebejda               ‘red currants’
          hare-ATTR-berries
          epie-n-Cek cil’                 ‘ladybird’
          grandmother-ATTR-foreman
          jaqga-d-as’é                    ‘horse’
          Yakut-ATTR-deer
          jos’e-d-amun                    ‘buttock’
          lump-ATTR-bone
This way of word formation can be applied for naming new phe-
nomena, cf. two alternative nouns for spectacles, 0j-d-ayd’e
(stone-ATTR-eye) and and’e-d-ajbi_ (eye-ATTR-shade).
136     Chapter   5.   Nominal   morphology      In some cases, one member of such a compound does not occur
independently:(265)     ana-n-muge ‘lip’                              aja ‘mouth’
          jouho-d-art ‘bag’                             jouho ‘back’

Chapter 6
Verb morphology
1. Major types of verb forms
The verb paradigm falls into four subparadigms: the Finite forms,
the Attributive forms, the Nominal forms, and the switch-reference
forms (converbs), This section describes how these forms are built,
and provides an overview of their functions (which are treated in
more detail in the respective chapters on syntax).","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"
"1.4.7. Functions of the Connective form
The Connective form is formally identical to the nominal Comi-
tative form in -n’it (see 5.4.2.3.2). In comparison to other switch-
reference forms, it occurs rather infrequently and seems to signify
some sort of contrastbetween the connected events.

1.4.8. Functions of the Negative converb
The Negative converb is formally identical and semantically close
to the nominal Privative form (see 5.5.2). This form signifies that
the expectable accompanying event did not take place. If the
idea of counter-expectation is absent, the negated forms of other
166      Chapter    6.   Verb morphologyconverbs are used (see (312b), (315a) above).                  In this sense, the
Negative converb can be seen as the negative counterpart of the
Connective form (1.4.7).

"2.2.1. The connective particle aj ~ ajz ‘too, again, still’
The particle aj is employed to link a clause to a clause referring to
a (semantically) similar situation, most often signified by the same
verb. In the simplest case, the situations linked by means of this
particle are just two occurrences of the same situation, with the
same sets of participants. In this case the particle can be glossed
as ‘again’ (if the clause describes the second occurrence of the
situation, (913), (914)) or ‘too’ (if it describes the first occurrence
(914)). The clauses involved need not be adjacent (e.g., in (913a)
two instances of the particle refer back to two different preceding
clauses). The particle takes the preverbal position:

with respect to the temporal order of the situations (914b):

The same    particle can link clauses describing similar situations
with distinct sets of involved participants. The examples in (915)
illustrate the case where the situations differ in one participant
slot. In (916), the participants are rearranged with respect to
their roles in the situation. If the NP representing the changed
participant is not adjacent to the verb form, the particle normally
takes the postnominal position (916b)         (otherwise, the preverbal
and postnominal positions cannot be distinguished). If this NP
is marked as the grammatical Focus, the particle takes the pre-
nominal position (see (915d), (919a)).1°4

In a few cases, this particle establishes              a link between a           finite
clause and a non-finite clause within the same sentence:

           “Where they had the house, they had an awning
           too.’ [F54|
The variant      ajz is used   if the clause does not describe another
occurrence of a situation, but the same protracted situation (which
is thereby marked to take place still, although the time reference
has changed). The variant @j can occur in this case as well. In this
context, the particle can be glossed as ‘still’ or ‘yet’, depending on
whether the clause is positive or negative:

532      Chapter   14.   Coreference   and   discourse    coherenceIn transitive clauses, the variant aj: can mean ‘more’ (with the
scope over the O participant), in contrast with aj (which can only
mean      ‘too’ in similar contexts).                     Note that the meanings ‘still’
and ‘more’ can be distinguished by means of the linear position
of the particle, cf. (918c) and (919a). If the construction involves
quantifier floating (8.3), the particle is placed before the quantifier
(919).105

The enclitic -de ~ -te (the latter variant occurs after voiceless
consonants) establishes a rather loose and semantically nonspe-
cific link (‘and, too’) with the immediately preceding clause. It
is attached to the first word of the clause (even if it is an NP
modifier; see (920a), (920b)).

This particle can also function as a sort of contrastive marker, i.e.,
it contrasts the clause to some implied presupposition (‘even’), In
this function, this particle is attached to the constituent it focuses
(921c). It is often combined with an intensifier (921a)-(921b).

Introduction
1. Kolyma Yukaghir       and its genetic affiliation
Kolyma Yukaghir is spoken by about 50 people in the settle-
ments Nelemnoye and Zyryanka, Upper Kolyma district, Yaku-
tia (Sakha) Republic and in Seymchan and Balygychan, Maga-
dan region, Russia. Until very recently, Kolyma Yukaghir has not
been written; the writing system used for the first publication of
Yukaghir folklore (Nikolaeva 1989) and currently employed in the
school in Nelemnoye is based on the Cyrillic alphabet . This gram-
mar describes the variety of Kolyma Yukaghir spoken by the oldest
generation of Yukaghirs in Nelemnoye.
    Kolyma Yukaghir is one of two existing Yukaghir languages
(which used to be referred to as dialects of Yukaghir in the liter-
ature). Another Yukaghir language, Tundra Yukaghir, is spoken
mainly in the settlements Andryushkino     and Kolymskoyc,   Lower
Kolyma district, Yakutia. The Yukaghir languages are convention-
ally considered a genetically isolated group; yet they can probably
be affiliated with the Uralic family (Angere 1956; Bouda 1941;
Collinder 1940, 1960, 1965; Nikolaeva 1988a; 1988b),2. An overview of Kolyma        Yukaghir    grammar
2.4. Phonology and morphophonemics
The vowel system comprises six short vowels,     as represented   in
(1), and their long counterparts.

          /e/, (9              fof
The long vowels /e/, /o/, /#/ can be pronounced as the falling
diphthongs /ie/, /uo/, /u@/.
      The consonant system is represented in Table 1.
      The syllable structure is very simple: with few exceptions, there
exist only syllables of the form                         CV,       CVC (at the beginning of
words, also V, VC). Hence, there are no vowel chisters. Voiced
obstruents are impossible in word-initial and syllable-final posi-
tion; in syllable-final position, voiced obstruents alternate either
with their voiceless counterparts or with sonorants. Voiced and
voiceless consonants                 cannot         co-occur within        a consonant             cluster,
hence syllable-initial voiced obstruents are regularly devaiced at
morphemic boundaries after obstruents.
    Two types of morphophonemic strategies are employed to main-
tain the transparent syllabic structure: first, a number of Yuk-
aghir suffixes show allomorphic variation of the form -Ce- ~ --C-
(below, syllabic vs. consonantal allomorphs).                                     Basically, the allo-
morphs are chosen in such a way as to create a sequence of the
form {...~ Cie — Cy —Cy3e—...} or {...-C,

1.€,, a consonantal morph is selected after a syllabic morph, and
vice versa. Secondly, the epenthetic submorphs -u- and -l- can
be inserted in order to avoid consonant and vowel clustering at
morphemiec boundaries.
                                 An   overmew   of Kolyma   Yukughtr grammer   3    There arc two kinds of harmonic alternations which can be
conventionally termed palatal and labial, yet both affect only a
very restricted number of suffixes, only one of which is produc-
tive. Palatal harmony contrasts the vowels /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/
(with their long counterparts) and the vowels /a/, /o,/ (with their
long counterparts); to some extent, it also determines distribution
of the velar obstruents and their uvular counterparts. Labial har-
mony produces the alternation /e/ ~ /o/ in some suffixes after
roots with /o/ or /o/ in the first syllable.
    Word stress is mobile; to a large extent, it is determined by the
syllable structure: closed syllables and open syllables with long
vowels attract the stress to the end of a word.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"
"3.1.2. Singular with inherently plural and dual nouns
There are some nominal stems signifying multiple-entity objects,
so that the Singular form refers to multiple entities (140a)-(140b).
In particular, this is the case for cthnonyms derived by means of
the morpheme d’z ‘people” (140c).

A number of nouns signifying entities which normally occur in
pairs (e.g., certain body parts, various kinds of shoes, etc.) usually
refer to a pair of entities in the Singular form (141). The singular
meaning is possible as well, but it has to be supported                          by the
numeral irk-in ‘one’ (142a)-(142b); another option to indicate the

possible, see 3.2.1):

agreement may be both plural (145a) and singular (145c). See 8.3
for further details on the scalar quantifiers.","[101, 102, 103, 104]"
"1.1.2. “Frozen” Plural marker
In combination with three nominal stems, the Plural marker can
lose its meaning, so that a second Plural marker can be attached
in order to express the plurality of entities:(125)       kaj ~ kojl          koj-pe       kaj-pe-pul    ‘boy, man, male’
            paj ~ pajl          paj-pe       paj-pe-pul    ‘woman, female’
            ug                  ugr-pe       ugr-pe-pul    ‘child.’
                                                Formation of major categories    75In all cases, the simple stem (without the “frozen” Plural morph) is
still in use (126), so that there arises a three-way contrast between
Number forms.      The stems kgj ‘boy, man’,            ug ‘child’ can attach
the Plural marker with the expected plural meaning (127).                       The
stem paj does not attach the regular Plural marker, i.e., the first
Plural marker cannot signify plurality when attached to this stem.

The “frozen” combinations paj-pe, kej-pe can be used as the Sin-
gular forms (128); for the form ugr-pe this is impossible, i.e., it
always has the meaning of plurality. However, this stem can at-
tach the second Phiral marker, with an unclear semantic impact
(see (129c)).

Apart from the Comitative form in -n’e {see Table 10), there used
to be a form in -n’o (Krejnovich 1982:44, 48), now practically
obsolete. In my corpus, there is only one example of this form:
 (130)         tat    anea-t                  ejre-t           ace-gu
               |CA    search-Ss:IPFV]         [walk-Ss:IPFV|   deer-POSss

               ‘She walked, searched and found his deer (lying)
               together with a crane.’ [K3]
The functional distinction between the two Comitative forms can
be reconstructed as following: the Comitative in -n’0 used to mark
NPs associated with the non-subject participants, while the form
in -n’e had been used only for “companions” of the subject partic-
ipant. Now, the latter form is easily applied in both environments
                                           Formation of major categories   77
(see 4.2.3 for further details).
   The suffix -n’E- functions in two modes, as the Comitative
marker and as the Proprietive marker with a meaning like ‘have X,
be (provided) with X’, where X is signified by the nominal stem
(see 4.2.3, 5.5.1). The combination of the Proprietive and the
same-subject Imperfective suffix -t has been frozen as a distinct
Comitative marker.      This complex marker has the form -n’-u-t (-
n’- + -t) after {+E }-stems, -n’i-t (< -n’e- + -t) after {+E}-stems
{see 3.3.4.1.6), cf. Sad-n’it ‘with a tree’ and SoromE-n’ut ‘with a
man’.","[94, 95, 96, 97]"
"5.2. Attributive marking
The non-Possessive Attributive form is available for arguments of
postpositions, but occurs extremely rarely. In fact, there are but
few examples of this usage (602). This is quite predictable, since
the arguments of postpositions are normally referential, which pre-
cludes Attributive marking (see 2.3).

In contrast to this, the Possessive AttributivePossessive marking!in
postpositional phrases form is employed much more frequently for
arguments of postpositions than for noun modifiers.

If the argument of a postposition is an Action Nominal or a Re-

“default” version.

Syntax of the clause
This chapter discusses the case marking of the core participants
in finite (1.1) and non-finite (1.2) clauses. The most remark-
able feature of case marking in Yukaghir is the extensive employ-
ment of the well-known affinities between the core participant roles
and pragmatic (or information-packaging) properties of NPs (1.3).
Section 1.4 provides summaries of syntactic properties which may
serve to identify the grammatical relations of subject, direct object
and indirect object.
    The most frequent word order is verb-final, yet the relative
order of constituents is largely determined by their pragmatic roles
(1.5).
   Verb valence patterns are described in section 2.       Section   3
provides an overview of clausal adjuncts.","[341, 342, 343, 344, 345]"
"4.1, Comitative strategy
The Comitative strategy           represents    a sort of intermediate case
between the coordination of NPs (and-like) and the comitative
adjunct (with-like), a situation which seems to be fairly typical for
languages without a separate morpheme for “and” (Mithun 1988;
Stassen forthcoming).
   The Comitative marker -n’e (5.4.3.2.1) can be employed to con-
join two (and only two) NPs representing the subject (590) or the
object (591) participants (it is not applied to more marginal par-
ticipants). This construction is also possible with the alternative
Comitative form in -n’it ~ -n’ut; see 5.4.2.3.2 for examples.

               ‘Since he hated her song, he took his bow and arrows
               and shot at her.’ [F37]
The Comitative marking licenses only the single-event (‘together’)
interpretation of clauses like in (590)-(591), ie., such a construc-
tion cannot be employed to describe two separate events involving
the conjoined participants in the same role.
    The Comitative either creates a single noun phrase or intro-
duces a new (comitative) participant (see 5.4.2.3.1). Accordingly,
if the Comitative is associated with the subject participant, the
verb agreement can be either Plural (see (590)) or Singular (592)).
(592)      a. tay      pajpe        up-die        kind’e-n’e         kebe-s’

           c. n’e-ganide                  gon-ol+mozu        el j-lejdi-t

           ‘She did not know where to go and lay down there
           together with the bear.’ [F4]
Furthermore, even if the agreement is Plural, the NP created by
means of this strategy is not subject to the Coordinate Structure
Constraint, i.e., the non-Comitative subject participant can be
dropped:
(593)   a. met     emd’ie-n’e                  pon’o-jon-pe
           my      younger.sibling-COM         remain-SBNR-PL
           0-d’e
           COP-INTR:1SG
           ‘I remained there with my younger sister.’
        b. tan met pajpe        ug-die-n’e              éugte
           that my     woman girl-DIM-COM               always
           me+juod-2’s
           AFF+play-INTR:1PL
           ‘I always played with that girl.’
Note that in the periphrastic verb form in (593a), the nominal form
of the lexical verb bears the Plural marker, while the copula shows
Singular agreement. These observations suggest that there is no
clear border between ‘and’ and ‘with’ functions of the Comitative.
    The Comitative marker -n’it (see 5.1.2, 5.4.2.3.2) can be ap-
plied to create a list of two or more NPs, each of which takes the
Comitative marker:

"5.2.     The Privative form

the prepositional negative marker el-/- and the postpositional mor-
pheme +éugn:

See 6.1.4.8 about a formally identical Negative non-finite form of
verbs.","[140, 141]"
"3.1.    Predictive conditional constructions
The Predictive conditional construction implies that the situation
signified by the finite clause is possible in the future. Thus, the
finite verb can take the Future form (705)-(706), the Prospective
form (707), or the Imperative form (see 1.2}. This marking im-
poses the neutral mode of reference and thus precludes the use
of an ordinary switch-reference form in the setting function (see
1.2). As a result, the conditional switch-reference clause is em-
ployed to express either a condition under which the finite clause
situation is predicted to take place or a temporal setting for this
situation; that is, the conditional chaining does not distinguish be-
tween hypotheses (ifclauses, examples (705))}) and presumptions
(when-clauses, examples ((706)) with future time reference, or, in
other words, any presumptions concerning the future are treated
as hypothetical.”*

3.2.    Generic conditional constructions
The generic conditional construction is signified by the Imperfec-
tive (708) or the Habitual (709) form of the finite verb.                      Neither
of the clauses involved denotes a specific actual situation; rather,
they refer to any situation of the given type which might have
occurred or is going to occur. This imposes the neutral mode
of reference, hence the availability of the conditional construction
(see 1.2).
   The Imperfective marking on the finite verb signifies that the
situations described are possible (708a)-(708b) or regularly occur
(708c)-(708d) at various time points in past, present, or future,
i.e., within an unlimited period including the time of speech (see
6.3.2.3).

used to occur regularly within some period of time in the past (see

 3.3. The unreality conditional constructions
The unreality conditional construction is marked by the combina-
tion of the Inferential marking on the switch-reference form (6.2.5)
and the Irrealis marking on the finite verb (6.2.4). The conditional
clause can signify either a situation which is taken to be possible
in the future, but unlikely to happen (710a), or a counterfactual
situation with nonpast (710b) or past (710c) time reference.

398      Chapter 10.   Clause chatning3.4. Inferential conditional constructions
In the Inferential conditional construction, the conditional clause
is presented as the basis of the judgment expressed by the finite
clause. This is the only construction type which licenses condi-
tional chaining without any marking of the neutral mode of refer-
ence on the finite verb; hence, the very absence of such marking
signifies the inferential use of the conditional chaining.
    The finite verb takes the unmarked (non-Future) tense-mood
form if the implied time reference is nonpast, (711a) and the Infer-
ential form otherwise (see (711b), (712)). This distribution is de-
termined by the semantics of the Inferential marker, which implies
that the situation has taken place before the time of speech (see
6.2.5). As a result, the conditional chaining entails the (inferred)
past-in-the-future interpretation of the unmarked tense form.

The conditional clause in the Inferential construction can signify
just the action of reflection which brings the speaker to the con-
clusion expressed by the finite clause:

of clause chaining in which the finite clause situation is taken to
be prior to the non-finite clause situation.","[413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419]"
