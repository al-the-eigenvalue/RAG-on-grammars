  D. The instructor asks each student
     a question that can be answered with
     a “push” word. The student responds
     appropriately, using a ba-­instrumental

   students with an appropriate base word
   or another instrumental prefix verb that
   is built on the same base as one of the
   ga-­verbs. The students respond with
   the corresponding “impersonal force”
   instrumental prefix verb. While doing so,
   they should make a gesture for “striking”
   by whapping a pen against their other
   hand. Example:
     Wagōⁿze: Thiˀúde. (“Make a hole.”)

   students with an appropriate base word
   or another instrumental prefix verb that
   is built on the same base as one of the
   mū-­verbs. The students respond with the
   corresponding “shooting” instrumental
   prefix verb. While doing so, they should
   use a gesture for “shooting” by jabbing
   the index finger of the right hand into the
   palm of the left hand. Example:
     Wagōⁿze: Hôⁿ. (“Night.”)
     Ttáppuskazhiⁿga: Mūhoⁿ. (“Shoot till
       dark.”) [with a “shooting” gesture]
     Wagōⁿze: Bihíthe. (“Blow away.”)
     Ttáppuskazhiⁿga: Mūhithe. (“Blow
       away.”) [with the “shooting” gesture]
D. The instructor asks each student a
   question that can be answered with a
   “cutting” word. The student responds
   appropriately, using a mū-­instrumental
   prefix verb. Example:
     Wagōⁿze: Rory akʰa águdi a? (“Where’s
      Rory?”)
     Barbara: Rory akʰa mūgthoⁿ athá.
       (“Rory wandered off.”)
     Wagōⁿze: Ttáx̌ ti thiⁿ thakkíde a? (“Did
      you shoot at the deer?”)
     Dan: Áoⁿ, akkíde éde, mūaṣhnoⁿ. (“Yes,
      I shot at it, but I missed.”)
E. The students form small groups
   of about two or three and take turns
   asking each other questions that can
   be answered using a mū-­or other
   instrumental prefix verb. Using the
   corresponding gestures with them is
   encouraged.

                                                  • The thi-­instrumental prefix verbs
                                                    sometimes pair with ba-­verbs to reverse

                                                    normally means any action that would
                                                    be performed manually, it means pulling,
                                                    or directing the action back to the actor
                                                    when paired with a corresponding ba-­
                                                    verb. Thus, where ba-­dóⁿ generically
                                                    means “push,” thi-­dóⁿ generically
                                                    means “pull.” The base word doⁿ may
                                                    not specifically mean “pull” after all, but
                                                    rather any kind of forced motion toward
                                                    or away from the actor.
                                                  • All ba-­instrumental prefix verbs
                                                    conjugate the same way, as simple stop
                                                    b verbs. The affixed pronoun comes
  • The instrumental prefix ba-­suggests that

    wood with the European sawing style of
    cutting on the push stroke, is basé, “cut
    by pushing.” Cutting against the ground
    or with machinery, like mowing the
    lawn, is noⁿsé. To thatʰé, “eat” or “chew,”
    and noⁿtʰé, “kick,” we can now add batʰé,
    “sew.” The meaning of the base word tʰe
    is still mysterious, but it might mean
    something like “jab” or “thrust,” as teeth
    into food, a needle into hide, or feet into
    anything. We also discover the new base
    word x̣ u, meaning “mark,” in matching
    thix̣ ú, “draw,” with bax̣ ú, “write.”

Pronoun CombinationsWe now have two series of affixed pronouns:
an agent series for “I,” “you,” and “we”; and a
patient series for “me,” “you,” “us,” and “them
(animate).” Our task in this lesson is to learn
how to combine them, so that we can say “I do
it to you,” “you did it to me,” “we did it to them,”
and so forth.

How to Construct an Omaha Sentence
The English method relies on permutations of
classes of concept words and is extremely com-
plicated. The Omaha method is to use a spe-
cial word for each type of demand and is quite
simple.
   Note that in Omaha, verbs always come after
their nouns, whether these are subject or object.
This is entirely different than in English, where
object nouns normally come after their verb.
Thus in English [The cat (subject noun)] [caught
(transitive verb)] [the mouse (object noun)], but
in Omaha [The cat (subject noun)] [the mouse
(object noun)] [caught (transitive verb)].

   • Locative u-­words can be either nouns                   exaggerate
     or verbs. When they are verbs, they                   ubétʰoⁿ: wrap, as with a blanket or towel
     can be turned into nouns by adding a
                                                           ubíhe: line of gravel left by a grader
     nominalizing wa-­in front of them, just
     as with many other verbs.                             ubísoⁿde: crowded, people pressed
                                                             together
   • When wa-­is added to a locative u-­verb, it
     shows itself by pulling the accent forward            učʰízhe: weedy, thicket, brush, forest with
     onto the u-­and making it canonically long.             lots of little trees   • The reason for this is historical. The                udá: icebound
     Omaha /u/ sound was originally                        ugádoⁿ: pound in,
     pronounced /o/, as in most other Siouan                 as a nail
     languages. So locative u-­was originally              ugákkiba: split
     locative o-­. A locative o-­verb o-­háⁿ               ugánoⁿppaze: dark,
     could be turned into a noun by adding                   pitch black,
     nominalizing wa-­, wa-­ó-­haⁿ, which would              as from a blackout
     pull the accent forward to the second
                                                           ugásˀiⁿ: peek in
     syllable, o-­. But the a and the o were hard
     to distinguish, so they blurred together              ugáṣni: cool down,
     into one long vowel ō, making the word                  as in the evening           Fig. 192. učʰízhe: thicket     wō-­haⁿ. Then Omaha and Ponca raised                  ugáṣnoⁿ: lasso, throw a
     the vowel /o/ to /u/. This theoretically                loop over something
     made the word wū-­haⁿ. But /w/ is a semi-­            ugáspe: depression, indentation,
     vowel that is used as a consonant, but is               as on a bed where you sat
     really pronounced about the same way as
                                                           ugáshke: tie, as a horse
     the vowel /u/, and can’t be distinguished
                                                           ugáshoⁿ: travel, journey
     from it here. So the w merged with the u,
     and the resulting noun ends up as ūhaⁿ.               ugáttoⁿthe: tumble, roll over
   • Any time a locative u-­word has the accent            ugíppi: full, as a cup of water
     on the first syllable as ū-­, it means that there     ugóⁿba: getting light out, dawn
     are actually two elements there, wa-­+ u-­.

   students with a base word, and the            Locative u-­ Verbs
   students respond with a corresponding
   u-­word. While doing so, they should use
   the gesture of thrusting the right hand
   forward as they grasp the right wrist
   with the left hand. Example:
      Wagōⁿze: Batʰé. (“Sew it.”)

   each student that can be answered with          • Locative u-­verbs generally conjugate

 E. The students form small groups

    choose who did it.

                                                      However, many of these base words are
                                                      shared between the two instrumental
                                                      prefixes, and that allows us to triangulate
                                                      in on their meaning, just as we can for

                                                     in which they are made. In English, we
                                                     distinguish two series: the voiced stops b,
                                                     d and g; and the voiceless stops p, t and k.
                                                     The voiceless stops are usually aspirated,
                                                     which means that a puff of air comes out
                                                     with them. The voiceless stops are not
                                                     aspirated when they are preceded by s.
                                                     The voiced stops are never aspirated.
                                                   • In Omaha, we distinguish several series
                                                     of stops. First is the simple series p, t
                                                     and k. These occur only when they are
                                                     preceded by s or some similar consonant.
                                                   • The second is the voiced series b, d
                                                     and g. These are like the sounds in

  • In section 15.8 we saw how verbs of              wamí: blood
    position and verbs of motion could be
    used as continuatives, to imply that
    the action is ongoing. We can also use         Vocabulary: Verbs
    positionals after verbs in the same way.
                                                     hóⁿbthe: dream
    This principle can be used to convey an
    even more powerful and precise sense of          ídathe: be born
    the nature of the action. Using positionals      shkóⁿ: move around,           Fig. 142. nióⁿba: moon
    in this way can perhaps be viewed as               be active
    describing the scene or situation rather         wégazhi: command them
    than narrating specific actions.
  • When positionals are used after a verb,
    they occur in place of the particles i and
    bi. Therefore, an -­e verb does not ablaut
    to -­a before a positional, and bi ama after
    a positional is replaced simply by ama.
  • In the nineteenth century the positionals
    akʰa and ama were sometimes changed
    to akʰé and amé in this situation. Our
    speakers today recognize akʰé but not amé.
    They tell us that akʰé means that somebody
    is about to do something. The nineteenth-­                            Fig. 143. hóⁿbthe: dream

The Six Active Subject Positionals
                                                       • The positionals tʰoⁿ and thiⁿ are

                                                         them much in this course.
                                                       • The positional kʰe is basically an
                                                         inanimate term that is used with

     inanimate objects.                                  asleep; (3) for someone so sick or injured
   • Of the five animate positionals, only               as to be unable to get up; and (4) for

     they have been dropping out of use in the

                                                     Vocabulary: Nouns
   • The positional thiⁿkʰé originally may
     have meant “sitting.” In historical               āgthiⁿ: chair
     Omaha, however, it refers generically             hóⁿtˀega: fly
     to the object or recipient of an action,          ithādi: father,
     regardless of the being’s posture. Like                                   Fig. 122. hóⁿtˀega: fly

     of being manifest.

   • The positional thoⁿkʰá is the plural of
                                                       nudóⁿ: warrior
     thiⁿkʰé. It probably refers specifically to a
     small, closed, manifest set, as a collective      wamóskex̌ude: flour
     plural, like the plural usage of akʰá.
   • The positional ma seems to imply a
