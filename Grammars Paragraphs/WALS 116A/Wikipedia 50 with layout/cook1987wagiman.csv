used as a greeting corresponding to mamak 'goodbyef. It

ion, involving questions which can be answered with yaway
'yes' or wi3ya 'no', and non-polar interrogation, where
yaray or ri'ya are inaproppriate responses. Non-polar
interrogation involves so-called 'WH' questions, in which an
interrogative element of some type is required in the quest-
ion, and which defines what is being questioned.",[300]
"10,2       InterjectionsInterjections are few in number and include mamak 'goodbye',
and yaray 'yes1 and ri'ya 'no' which are used in response to
polar questions.   The short forms yu and yo are used for
'yes' in response to requests for attention or when being
addressed. ri'ya also occurs with the nominal gala 'very'
to reinforce the negation, or to mean, 'I don't know', for
example :10-38    wi'ya   gala,     dyilimakun    ganiggin

         'I don't know.'wi'ya has also been recorded in a small number of examples
with the form ga to mean 'do not want (to do)'.    The few
recorded examples provide no clue of the status of ga as
either a suffix or a word, nor any evidence of its possible
wider meaning. It is not glossed in the following example:10-40   rilya qa        gongonay-gu     [LMD 6851

        .'I don't want to talk (I am going to go to
        sleep). 'The tag form gale occurs commonly in final position in
questions, and, uttered with a rising intonation contour,
has the effect of requesting confirmation of the fact of the
question by the addressee. Few examples occurred in record-
ing sessions because speakers tended not to ask questions
themselves. A typical example occurred in the question
(often addressed to me by speakers at Rybrook Farm) 'The
others have gone to get food, haven't they?', the point of
which was to ask politely whether they could get a ride into
town or not. A reply 'no' or 'not yet' would then be fol-
lowed by a request for a lift as well:

         'They have all gone to get food, haven't they?'gale is also able to occur alone in response to statements
by other speakers. In this way, it has the sense of, ' Is
that so?', or, 'Really?'.","[298, 299, 300]"
"     'WH' questions are introduced with a clause-initial interro-
     gative element of some type.    These are from various word
     classes, and their approximate meanings are as follows:
     dyalan 'what1,dyamba 'when', baniqa '(say) what, (do) what'
     and barri 'QUESTION'.    barri is an interrogative proform
     root for suffixes which create meanings such as 'where from'
     and 'who' for the stem. baniqa is a participle. All 'WH'
     interrogative items are described in following sections.     10.3.1   dyamba 'when'     The relationship between dyamba 'when' and the same form
     with an Irreakis negative meaning described in 10.1.1 above
     is unclear; there is no evidence suggesting either homonymy
     or an original polysemy. As an interrogative form, dyamba
     questions the time of a predicate activity which has not yet
     taken place, and thus carries irrealis meaning.",[301]
"The class of interjections includes the words wi'ya 'no' and
yaray 'yes'. There is also a word gale which generally
occurs in clause-final position as a tag question, but can
also occur alone to mean 'Is that true?' or 'Really?'. Its
word class membership is thus somewhat difficult to define,
but is described with interjections in 10.2 below.",[287]
"Polar interrogative sentences are syntactically identical
with declarative sentences, but differ in their intonation
contour; generally, major constituent order is unaffected.
Polar question intonation is not well understood, with few
examples occurring in the tape-recorded corpus.   Auditory
impressions of non-recorded examples indicate that such
     questions have a generally rising intonation over the final
     syllables, in opposition to declaratives which have a gener-
     ally falling final intonation contour. Alternations in word
     order due to pragmatic factors can alter this dramatically,
     with rising intonation occurring over single clause-initial
     items if only they are being queried. However, this is not
     an area that has been well recorded, and no concrete exam-
     ples can be discussed here.","[300, 301]"
"An important function of the lpl inclusive suffix is prov-
iding unambiguous lpl reference in intransitive clauses
without a free pronoun, because of the neutralization of the
lpl and 2sg contrast in verb pronominal prefix forms (cf.
section 7.1 and Figure 7-1 below).    If -4ana did not occur
in some expressions, it would be potentially difficult to
interpret the intended pronominal referent from the prefix
only, because both lpl and 2sg have the forms i      gi- and
mi-, and so on. This potential difficulty would seem to be
particularly increased in questions because the the hearer,
for general pragmatic reasons, is less certain about what
particular information (in this case, which pronominal ref-
erent) is being requested by the speaker. Declarative utt-
erances would presumably be more open to contextual inter-
pretation and suffer from less ambiguity. However, most lpl
intransitive questions are suffixed with -qana, as in exam-
ple 6-118 below, while finite verbs that commence with gi-,
gi- and mi- and which are not marked with it are interpreted
as being 2sg. This varies according to obvious contextual
situations, but the following examples are typical:
         'Are we going now?'","[181, 182]"
"     In such examples, the distinction between the question and
     Irrealis negative interpretation of the sentence is through
     its intonation contour.
10,3.2   dya'an    'what'Apart from questioning 'what', dya'an can be suffixed with
the Dative case marker -gu to mean 'what for, why', or the
Ablative case marker -gunda to mean' 'what from':10-44    dya'an     maDan

         'What are you sick from. I10,3.3   baniqa '(do) vhat, (say) what'This participle has the interrogative sense of 'what', but
rather than questioning an argument of a clause, it quest-
ions the verb or predicate. When used alone, without a
finite verb, it can mean 'What did you say?, or 'What is
this called?', in what is essentially an idiomatic function:10-48    banirga     ma'an;         Yanbulloo station Vestey's
                                        II              It         !I

         [DLB 2;121
         'What is the name of this place?                    Manbulloo

         say what
         'What did you say?'
However, when baniqa occurs in a finite verb clause, it
requests information about the action, process or state
described by the finite verb. Such a function is quite rare
in Australian languages generally, in which similar inter-
rogation is usually expressed only by case-marked indefinite
nominals (Dixon 1980:372pp).    A similar contrast between
interrogation of the verb action and an argument of the verb
also occurs in Waray, however (Harvey 1986:93). baniga can
thus be translated as either 'how' or 'what':10-50    baniqabaniqa    gu-yu           matyin     ma'an      dupa

formation.concerning 'who' and 'where'. When suffixed with
the form -miya it means 'who1, and can be further marked
with case suffixes to express various grammatical relations:10-53    barri-miya   ga'an   lagiban    9-di-nya-vu

"The translations provided by speakers for the rare occur-
rences of other -ya'an alternants (one each for yu'naya'an
and gurr'maya'an) did not indicate any apparent causative
meaning for them, although such an interpretation did not
seem impossible in their context. Both words were recorded
in unelicited speech. The root forms of each function occur
commonly without -yaman as class (ii) and (i) participles
respectively, supporting the hypothesis that its addition
may, at least in the past, have been a more productive pro-
cess. This question is discussed more fully in 11.5.2
below.",[256]
"        Instead of a situation of free variation, this behaviour
        suggests a possible linguistic change in progress, from one
        realization of word-initial stops to another. Although a
        sound change is likely to be phonetically abrupt, it will be
        diffused through a speaker's vocabulary only gradually (Wang
        1969:14-15).  It is possible that such a process is occurr-
        ing in Wagiman, in which only a part of the vocabulary of
        speakers has so far been affected. However, the question of
        directionality and rate arises: whether the change is to-
        wards a voiceless realization for all initial stops, in
        which case it has only just begun, or whether it is towards
        a voiced realization, and is therefore nearly complete.",[54]
"There is in general terms, a distinct lack of specificity in
the definition of the use of the terms 'fortis' and 'lenis'
in the descriptions of stop contrasts which use them.
Heath, for example, never questions their phonetic value, or
that the terms 'voiced' and 'voiceless' (or even 'long' and
short') might be more appropriate, although he does state
in his description of Ngandi (Heath 1978a) that duration is
equally as distinctive in distinguishing between the two
types of stops as voicing. For Ritharngu, Heath (1980b:8)
also states that the principal difference is one of voicing
and 'tenseness'.    It can only be presumed that Heath and
others intend that by 'fortis' and 'lenis' they mean a 'var-
iation in the degree of activity of the respiratory muscles'
(Ladefoged 1971:24). This is not always clear, however.",[64]
"An examination of Ngalakan pronominal prefixes yields a
possible loan source for -dyu-: the form ju- occurs as a
2sg transitive subject prefix in that language (Merlan 1983:
86,88), although the order is wrong for the Wagiman transit-
ive prefix (the 2sg item should precede the 3sg item in the
hierarchy).
A similar problem occurs for the 2sg/lpl form pigu-, which
has lpl reference accounted for by initial gi-, but in which
the 2sg object reference then cannot be unaccounted for; -gu
has no fixed value (apart from 2pl:IPFV) anywhere else in
the system. Many phonetic changes have obviously occurred
to obscure the earlier shape of most prefixes. The recons-
tructions are summarized in Figure 7-8; question marks ind-
icate where the source of a segment or form is unknown, or
the reconstruction is particularly uncertain.","[226, 227]"
"    I am also particularly indebted to the late Bill Woodman of
    Pine Creek, whose undemanding hospitality and friendship
    provided me with a home for the long months I spent living
    there while on fieldwork.
.
    I must extend my appreciation to Dr Peter Austin of La Trobe
    University, who suggested Wagiman as a language worthy of
    study. As my supervisor, he provided support in practical
    matters such as acquiring funding for the fieldwork, as well
    as reading and commenting on all stages of the work. His
    questions, ideas and criticisms were stimulating and provok-
    ing, and prompted many lines of investigation. Early drafts
    and sections of the description were also read by John
    Henderson of the Institute for Aboriginal Development and
    Gavan Breen of the School of Australian Linguistics, who
    made many constructive suggestions which I happily acknow-
    ledge here; any errors, of course, remain mine alone.",[14]

verb combinations to be stored in the lexicon if required.
Despite the productivity of the system generally, it is not
predictable for some cases, such as yorrtja + ge-na to mean
'to find' where ge-na usually means 'to put1, or for getja +
ge-na meaning 'to ask1. The latter example is understand-
able if getja is taken as meaning something like 'question',
but it is not a predictable combination: a finite verb such
as ya'an 'to say' would seem a priori to be just as likely,
but, in fact, does not occur.","[347, 348]"
"One difference that can be distinguished is illocutionary,
and participle-only participles seem to have more imperative
force than finite verb+participle forms.     Participle-only
imperatives have the effective discourse status of inter-
jections, and carry a relatively high amount of illocution-
ary force. Their brevity (never more than four syllables,
even for the negative forms and carrying only one tonic
stress) also permits them to be uttered with a great deal of
articulary force in any conversational exchange or speech
situation. In 9-36 and 9-39 where a participle-only impera-
tive occurs in the same utterance as a finite verb+partic-
iple imperative, the former construction occurs as the last
item in the sentence. In this position it has the illocut-
ionary effect of reinforcing the command expressed in the
finite clause, providing strong force for the utterance as a
whole. 49.4      Participles and aspect markingApart from Punctual marking in participle-only imperative
utterances, participles can be marked for Punctual or Sequ-
ential aspect in non-imperative finite clauses, and for
Punctual aspect in imperative finite clauses. In all cases,
the aspect marked on the participle functions as aspect
marking for the clause as a whole. It is thus possible for
participles to be marked for aspect while the finite verb in
the clause is marked only for tense or mood; the converse
situation also occurs.    Aspect marking on participles is   In 9-36 particularly, the use of buy' 'do completely' has
an effect similar to the tag 'Okay?' following some English
imperatives, such as, for example, 'Just do it, okay?'. The
direct illocution here is of a question, although it has the
indirect illocution of reinforcing the command rather than
genuinely rsqcesting a response; any response at all ought
only to take the form of an agreement.
outside the mood/tense/aspect system of finite verbs dis-
cussed in chapter 7 , and participles do not fall within any
scoping contra1 of the finite verb or each other.","[276, 277]"
"However, it is likely that the neutralization of lpl and 2sg
forms generally would also cause problems, particularly for
the lpl/2sg and 2pl/lsg functions (giqgu-, giqgu-, miggu-)
in questions such as, for example, 'Who is going to get
meat? Are you (pl) getting meat for us, or are we getting
meat for you (sg)?'    Unfortunately, the lack of recorded
conversational material in the language makes the normal
method of resolution of such potential problems difficult to
state. In the few recorded examples of giqgu- (it is a
relatively rare form insone-to-one language sessions because
in all its references, one actant is lpl), it occurred with
an overt Ergative case marked agent, or an unmarked (Abso-
lutive) pronominal patient. The lpl inclusive suffix q a n a
can also be used in intransitive clauses to indicate explic-
itly that the agent referent is lpl, but is structurally
ambiguous in transitive clauses when it occurs without overt
nominals to indicate the grammatical function of its refer-
ent (cf. 6.4.3).",[221]
"Both -ra and -ma occur after tense and aspect suffixation on
the stem, but their position relative to -gana 'Inclusive'
is variable. 11-62(a) is a more common idiom than 11-62(b),
however. Examples with the verb ya-ggi 'to go' are common,
and the use of -ra in the following examples with differing
time references are some of the most common expressions
uttered by speakers to the researcher, usually in regard to
the possibility of getting a lift by car somewhere, or in

"    As an areal typological feature, it is thus not unusual for
    Vagiman to carry some sort of temporal or aspectual marking
    in affixes before finite verbs.    The use of an invariable
    Desiderative prefix is typical, for example, of the function
    of morphological prefixes in many languages in the Arnhem
    Land and non-Pama-Nyungan area. l1 None of these languages,
    however, except for Maung (geographically far from where
    Wagiman was o~iginallyspoken), marked tense, aspect or mood
    on a regular, systematic basis. In the Daly River languages
    Ngankikurungkurr and Marrithiyel, evec though tense, aspect
    and mood is marked by suppletive pronominal prefix forms,
    they do not all represent the same tense, aspect or mood
    oppositions, and are also far from regular across all the
\   finite (auxil)iary)  verbs.   The real question of how the
    various forms developed in Wagiman must remain unanswered
    through the lack of identifiably similar systems in the
    area, by which reconstruction of the historical processes
    could be made; the mood and aspect variation must therefore
    be considered as an independent innovation,
    l1 This includes languages such as Nunggubuyu (Heath 1985),
    Mara (Heath 1981), Warndarang (Heath 1980c), Ngalakan (Mer-
    lan 1983), Mangarayi (Merlan 1982), Kunwinjku (Carroll 1976)
    and Rembarnga (McKay 1975). Many others are similar.
Chapter 8     Finite verb form and function8.1      Verb rootsThere are 39 recorded roots which can occur as finite verbs,
but some of these also occur as participles.          All finite
verbs can be classified on the basis of which one of eight
different Past tense suffixes they use (cf. 7 . 2 . 4 and Figure
7-3).   Distinct class membership can thus be provided for
most verbs, but for others, where there is only one verb in
the 'class', irregular verb status only can be proposed.","[233, 234]"

            %k  as in 'Un cheval v o l a n t m'a frappe' ( 'A fly-
ing horse hit me').     Similar examples occur in English:
'Falling off cliffs can be dangerous' (argument), and 'A
body falling towards the earth falls at a uniform rate'
(predicate).
4.5      InterjectionsInterjections are a closed class which constitute whole
utterances on their own. They differ from adverbs in their
syntactic independence of other parts of speech. Recorded
interjections are yaray 'yes', ilkawu 'yes indeed, alright',
wi'ya 'no' and mamak 'goodbye'. There is also a tag quest-
ion form gale, which can also be used as an interjection
reqcest for confirmation of a fact or other information.

                       deixis         There are three series of free pronouns: the Base and Obl-
         ique pronouns function as either core or indirect free arg-
         uments of a predicate respectively, while the Possessive
         pronouns function both as modifiers of a full nominal and
    /?   also as direct, headless nominal arguments of a predicate.","[111, 112, 113]"

"Recently, Blake (ms.:120) has suggested that languages like
Wagiman are possibly amenable to a bi- or multi-clausal
analysis, where the 'auxiliary' (the finite verb) is des-
cribed as the main clause verb and the 'particle1 (the part-
iciple) as the verb of a dependent clause. Nevertheless,
Blake rejects a bi-clausal analysis for Maranungku (a Daly
River language) for various reasons, and it is also rejected
here for Wagiman.   Several reasons, some similar to those
proposed by Blake, contribute to this:       (1)    In ambient constructions, the participle has
no arguments at all, and it is difficult to know how to
provide a bi-clausal paraphrase for an example such as 11-43
   Whether the prefix is an inflectional category or a syn-
tactic constituent is a theoretically abstract question, and
will not be addressed in what is primarily a descriptive
grammar. Certainly, it is a morphologically obligatory
constituent of the finite verb complex.
(given above as 9/8) because it cannot mean 'I hit him and I
returned':
         [GHY 83 ]
         'I used to hit him in return.'      (ii)    As in Maranungku (reported in Blake ms. , from
data in Tryon 1976) the scope of sentence adverbials covers
the entire clause, including both. finite verb and particip-
le(~), not just one or the other. :n 11-44 and 11-45 (given
as 10/13 and 10/14 respectively above) the adverb gorro
'tried but failed, later' has scope over both items in each
clause, despite the difference in relative ordering: in
11-44 the participle follows the finite verb, while in 11-45
it precedes it.11-44   gorro dyoro      ma-di,                   [DJM 4841

     (iii)    The meaning of mood, tense or aspect suffixes
on any one of the partiples or the finite verb applies to
all the others as well (see 9.4 above). 11-44 above illust-
rates this, where the Desiderative mood marker on -ya- 'to
go' applies also to bew'ma 'cross', suggestive of the fact
that the participle and finite verb form a unit of some
sort, at least in semantic terms as was suggested in 9.2.","[334, 335]"
"The alternative solution is that originally there were dis-
tinct forms for all of the neutralized functions, but that
they were then all reduced to the same form giggu- by var-
ious phonological processes which also reduced other forms
in the matrix.    Different original base forms would have
been affected in different ways, severely enough to obscure
completely any of the underlying traces of individual pron-
ominal forms. Such a solution provides no evidence of spec-
ific reductions or possible original forms, assuming as it
does that these are now totally lost, and is thus less open
to testing than the one given above.",[220]

by the phrase dyaman mamin is actually the start of a new

"An alternative possibility is that the prefixes represent
original vowel qualities, and that the fr.ee pronouns have
undergone any possible phonological change.     The original
vowels in the free pronouns could have been the high vowels
/u/ and i      Reduction of the final syllable of free pro-
nouns when they were prefixed could have produced prefix
forms $41- from 2sg sgigun and *gi- from lpl *gigu. Ambi-
guity would not have arisen if these early prefixes were
used in strict cross-referencing function, because their
full nominals would still have been in the clause and avail-
able for referential access; ambiguity still seems not to
occur, despite the lack of current cross-referential func-

9m4.3    Intentional (Allative marked) participlesAllative marked complement participles indicate an intention
on the part of the subject or agent of the finite clause to
undertake the action or process described by the participle.
Unlike the Purposive construction, the action of the finite
clause preceding the Allative marked participle is not a
pre-requisite for the completion or fulfillment of the act-
ion of the participle, nor the purpose of this action: the
participle in Intentional constructions merely defines the
intention of the clausal subject (or agent).     There is no
logical or other link between the action or motivation of
the finite verb and that of the participle, as in Purposive
constructions. For example, Purposive participle construct-
ions can be translated into English with the paraphrase 'for
the purpose of doing something'. Allative marked partic-
iples, however, can be translated with the paraphrase 'in-
tending to do something', and describe an internal state of
the participant.    The following examples illustrate this
point; 9-53 contrasts with 9-50 above, in which the Dative
case suffix is used in place of the Allative for the same
finite verb and participle:                                      .

"When -ra occurs on nominals, it serves to focus the marked
nominal relative to other items in the clause. In 11-66 -pa
on the Oblique object pronoun nug also has an anaphoric
effect, linking its referent with previous 3sg pronominal
references (see text DLB 1;4-6). The following occurrences

3 Th1rd person singular indicative perfective subject has
zero morphological realization, and verbs marked for this
value are thus slightly exceptional. Substitution with
another prefix form is available for strict word class
determination, however (see Figures 7-1 and 7-2 below, and
Chapter 7 generally).
4.3      ParticiplesParticiples form an open class which 4 s functionally quite
complex, having various features of nominals, adverbs and
verbs.   However, they are simply identified formally and
syntactically: they can be suffixed with the Dative, Ablat-
ive and Allative case suffixes to express adclausal comp-
lements; they can occur in a clause with a verb, marked for
Punctual or Sequential aspect and, when transitive, can have
an overt nominal object argument; they can be suffixed with
the nominal privative marker to express negative imperative
utterances; they can be suffixed with the nominal comitative
suffix to function as predicates of another nominal; and
they can occur alone, either unmarked or marked for punctual
aspect, as positive imperatives.","[109, 110]"
"There are a restricted number of finite verbs, and these are
listed in Chapter 8; the use and features of a number of
'special' verbs is also exemplified. Chapter 9 focusses on

"When used with the Potential prefixes, it has a distinct
future tense function, although its underlying meaning is to
describe the action as commencing at some time in the future
and progressing to some further time. The period of exten-
sion can be long or short in duration, and context usually
provides the desired interpretation. It therefore functions
as an indicator of unmarked future time with Potential pre-
fixes, although the progressive element can still be seen in
the following examples:7-32      dyamba         -

"As a definite article, it always precedes the nominal it is
modifying, identical with the use of definite article 'the'
in English, and leading to the possible conclusion that this
particular use of ga1an, or at least the word order, is the
result of influence from English. A further problem is the
fact that, in any case, the order of modifying nominals
relative to an NP head is not fixed, with the result that
deictics can also follow the NP head. 3The definite article interpretation of ga'an is not always
clearly distinguishable from a demonstrative interpretation
3 There is some apparently ivlmns;sScv\&   data on order of
elements within the NP, and it is now difficult to recons-
truct what the original system may have been, or whether it
has changed or not; see 21.1.
    I        without appropriate context, and often speakers will provide
        translations of the same example with both 'the' and 'that1.
        An appreciation of the context of these examples is thus
        important for their appropriate translation. Because many
        examples given here were recorded without much previous
        context (due to the fact that they may have been elicited
        translations of English sentences, but also because of the
        difficulties involved in recording more spontaneous utter-
        ances in the field), there is often an indeterminacy of
        translation ranging from examples where ga'an is obviously a
        definite article, to examples where it is obviously a demon-
        strative. There are also the examples which fall somewhere
        in between these two poles. In all cases, ga'an is glossed
        as 'that1, and any definite article interpretation is given
        in the free translation following the example.","[132, 133]"

   A similar process is attested in European languages, such
as German for example, where the modern polite second person
pronoun Sie developed from an earlier use of a 3sg pronoun
as a polite 2sg form (Brown and Gilman 1960:254). There is
no politeness value associated with the modern Wagiman form.
A similar example is found in Martuthunira in Western Aust-
ralia, where the 2sg pronoun kartu is probably cognate with
Yingkarta kartu 'man' (P. Austin pers. comm.).
The neutralization of the contrast between lpl/2sg, 2sg/lpl
and 2pl/lpl in the form qiggn- presents a more difficult
problem, and there is no definite resolution available from
the current data. The initial problem lies in proposing an
original function for the form qiggu- itself. On analogical
grounds, either lp1/2pl (as discussed above) or 3sg/lpl are
possible. The latter possibility is based on the fact that
3sg/2pl is comprised of the 2pl root gu- followed by -ggu;
qiqgu- could thus be lpl gi- followed by -ggu. An assumpt-
ion would also be that lpl/2sg qiqgu- is also not an origin-
al form, which does not seem unlikely given that other forms
with a 2sg patient end either with -ndyu or -ny.","[218, 219]"
"Their use in this manner is concordant with their underlying
meaning.   The primary semantic function of the Potential
prefixes is to indicate the possibility of occurrence of
particular actions, events or states. Also included within
the set of possible events are events which could occur in
the future. Future events which are certain to occur are
not excluded by the fact that the potential mood reflects
possibility only, because they are also at least possible.
When there is no overt tense marked on the verb by suffix,
the unmarked interpretation of Potential prefixes is there-
fore one of future time reference.
    Perfective aspect is generally used to refer to an activity
    with no explicit reference to its internal temporal constit-
1   uency, as if from outside the event (Comrie 1976:3,12).
!
    Events referred to in such a way are easily interpreted as
    being complete, whole events, and therefore in the past.
    Imperfective aspect, on the other hand, is used to present
    an event as if from within, with explicit reference to int-
    ernal temporal constituency (Comrie loc. cit.).  Because the
    event is presented from within, it can be considered in one
    way as ongoing, and therefore in the present or non-past.
    In Wagiman, the Perfective aspect always refers to past
    time, while the Imperfective, unless explicitly marked for
    past time by suffix, refers to non-past or present time. 2    Future time on non-tense-marked verbs is not always marked
    by a Potential mood prefix, and immediate future time, or
    events with a very high probability, are expressed with an
    Indicative Imperfective prefix. The speaker's belief that
    the action is more than only possible, and is effectively
    factual, is thus reflected by mood choice:    7-9      ga~ut    gaba-pa       bor a-g a'   [DLB 831

    ion in meaning which occurs for Past imperfective and Past
    perfective marked verbs:    2
       The west African languages Yoruba and Igbo, for example,
    which have no grammatical tense marking, also use aspect
    marking for time reference in the same way (Comrie 1976:82).

"Douglas Jack Milguyarri, Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, Max Band-

ritual and historical associations with country in the east
and north-east of the traditional land, while the Huddleston
family and Don Liddy Balambal tend to associate more with
the western area around goloy (Collah water 'hole).      Some
linguistic differences occur, based on this division, but
they are minor. The most obvious is variation in the use of
ni-gin and yu-pin as copula verbs, described in 8.2.3, and
the,use of the pair suffix - g i n , described in 6.4.1. Occ-
asionally speakers would also spontaneously provide a syno-
nym for a particular lexical item. An example here is the
word for 'knee', typically given as bondedi, but occasion-
ally in elicitation sessions the form dyatya would be provi-
ded consciously as an alternant. No source or reason for
the alternant was able to be given, merely that it was also
a Wagiman word,Other variation has origins more difficult to determine.
Douglas Jack Milguyarri consistently pronounced the word
gityiya 'tomorrow' as dyityiya. Whether this is a genuine
variant or merely the result of Milguyarri's isolation for
such a long time at Douglas Station is not clear. Other
speakers did not indicate any disapproval of the form, but
did acknowledge that only Milguyarri used it.",[38]
"                 The two rhotics are also unremarkable phonet-
ically: the apical tap is slightly post-alveolar, and is
 * yer a trill, while the glide is a post-alveolar a3proxim-
a b i , with distinct rhotic colouring. However, the tap var-
ies with a post-alveolar glide articulation identical with
the glide phoneme itself. Because some words contain a
glide which cannot be articulated as a tap, and a minimal
pair for /r/ and /rr/ has also been recorded, a distinct
phonemic' contrast can be justified. An asymmetrical neut-
ralization of the rhotic contrast thus occurs, but the    Dixon (1980:334-346) proposes as part of the historical
development of Pama-Nyungan pronoun forms an assimilation of
the same sort, where velar nasals eventually become palatal
before the high vowel i . The Wagiman data would seem to
provide some concrete synchronic evidence of this type of
assimilation in Australian languages, and thus partial sup-
port for Dixon's historical analysis.

phonetic or other (possibly discourse or style level) envir-
onment for the articulation of the tap as a glide is not
clear.    The functional load of the contrast is extremely
restricted, and the recorded minimal pair would also not
appear to be open to potential contextual ambiguity, since
it is 'pubic hair' (gurrun) contrasting with 'sun' (qurun),1.2         Consonant contrastsConsonant contrasts occur over different points and manners
of articulation.   There are in general very few recorded

similar or identical environments.le2.l    Stop contrastThe stop contrast occurs ~ n l yin certain medial positions:

case suffixed participle form madyigu 'for playing' (from

occurs following a glide and preceding a nasal, but this is
a non-contrastive environment for other consonants, as LCC
(and CCC) clusters are not permitted. Another non-contrast-
ive but unpredictable example is found in rifya 'no'. Other
predictable examples occur in intervocalic position in a
small number of words which have sequences of identical
vowels, such as na'an 'water'.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"
"Major evidence for the geminate analysis provided by McKay
is that the degemination and devcicing are observable phen-
omena across morpheme boundaries: both homorganic and het-
erorganic stop clusters which are formed through affixation
and other processes undergo devoicing, while homorganic
clusters are also degeminated. McKay extends this analog-
ously to medial position, and also states that speakers
pronounce the geminate stops in careful speech as longer
than the single stops.9A further value of the geminate approach is that it explains
the restriction of the apparent contrast to intervocalic and
word-medial position. By setting up clusters as the basis
for the distinction, the resulting contrast is represented
as reflecting phonotactic constraints in the language: the
contrast does not occur word-initially or word-finally bec-
ause consonant clusters are not permitted ordinarily in
these environments, while the neutralization of the contrast
following nasals can be seen as merely reflecting the cons-
traint on nasal+stop+stop clusters which applies in the rest
of the language.",[60]
"The class of participles includes items whose meanings would
place them in other classes in some other languages. The
open participle class tends to compensate for the closed
verb and adverb classes by having members which express
functionally verb-like and adverb-like meanings. Many words
whose meanings could potentially be coded as predicative
nominals actually occur as participles. This situation j\-4\-0
makes identifying an appriate name for the class more diffi-
                                                             $'
cult than for others because of the wide range of notional
and semantic functions covered, and the range of syntactic
possibilities expressed. Although these items are not de-
verbal or otherwise derived forms, the name 'participle' is
used here because of the nominal and predicate functions
which these words have, in much the same way as the 'parti-
ciple' forms of English and other European languages' verbs
can have both.predicate and argument features.44.4        AdverbsAdverbs form an apparently closed class, the members of
which are unsuffixed and occur in clauses containing at
least a verb.      Sub-classes of mood, manner, position and
time can be identified. The mood adverbs are dyamba 'can-
ndt , do not ' , r u d y i ' N E G A T I V E ' , menuny 'perhaps' , g o r r o
' tried but failed ' and manya ' can, must '        .    Many of the man-
ner, time and position adverbs have meanings which allow
them to occur in more than one sub-classification, suggest-
ing that only one other sub-class including them all can be
justified. However, approximate groups are: dyumbany
'last, afterwards, behind' and yoggona ' first , before, in
front' (both manner and position function), dyapan 'slowly',
g a h a 'fast' (manner function only); position adverbs wolok
'on top', wrnrya 'underneath', d a b a l i 'beside, around', dubay
'low down, downstream', gaqga 'high up, uphill'; and time
adverbs goko 'still, again' and ylmbama 'all the time' (as
well as gorro 'later').","[110, 111]"
"Other COMP constructions commonly occur with the verb ya'an
'to say, to tell', in which reported speech is presented in
such a way that it has the intonational characteristics of
'indirect' speech. Reported speech is usually given as
'direct', where it is repeated verbatim to another hearer.
Original tense or mood marking is maintained, and it is
clearly set off from the rest of the utterance by a separate
intonation contour, also usually from the original utter-
ance. Examples are common, particularly in text LMD 2, from
which the following is drawn. Also typical of such examples
is the repetition of the verb ya'an, which occurs both bef-
ore and after the reported material, and the retention of
the original intonation (not marked in the example below).
A direct speech translation is provided:11-31    9-ya 1-y i           mi-yu        qa-yu-ma ,   gigun

        'He said, ""You stay.     I am going to take you (as
        wife) '"".
COMP constructions differ primarily from direct speech exam-
ples in their intonation, and whilst the reported speech is
often separated from the rest of the utterance by an inton-
ation break, it is not then uttered with its original inton-
ation. Instead, it resumes with the same intonation as the
preceding phrase, so that both are effectively presented as
finite clauses in apposition, similar to ordinary conjoined
clauses.   Examples provided with COMP translations still
maintain the original mood and tense marking, but do not
have ya'an repeated at the end. They typically contain a
reference to the hearer or addressee of the speech act
through the presence of an overt Oblique object pronoun.
Example 11-32 below has quite complicated material following
the clause which introduces the reported speech, and also
has no intonation break preceding it; it was uttered with a
single intonation contour as a unit phrase and is thus rel-
atively long:11-32    ga'an    maluga      9-yam-yi          DanW

11.4.4   Relative constructionsRelative (REL) constructions are comprised of two clauses
which have a shared nominal referent expressed in their
pronominal prefixes, and which can also occur once as an
overt free NP. In this case it usually occurs between the
two predicates, and it is difficult to assign it to one
clause or the other. Like some COMP constructions, REL
constructions are usually uttered with the intonation con-
tour of a single phonological phrase.","[327, 328]"
"          Mood and aspect function of t h e prefixesThe three series of prefixes reflect two primary oppositions
of mood and aspect. The Imperfective and Perfective aspect
prefixes are essentially indicative in mood, and can be
contrasted with the Potential mood series. Within the Indi-
cative mood, an aspect distinction is made between imperfec-
tive and perfective.                          t
The Potential mood prefixes are used to reflect the speak-
er's belief that what he or she is saying is within the
realms of possibility only. In this sense they can be used
to refer to events, actions or states in the future, those
that might happen, or events or actions in general that
merely could occur. Potential mood prefixed verbs that are
negated reflect the speaker's belief that the possibility
does not exist. Indicative prefixes, on the other hand, are
used to indicate the speaker's belief in the essential real-
ity of what is being said, and are used to describe events
that are considered to be real and more than just in the
realms of possibility.    Because it is based on speakers'
beliefs, mood choice is flexible in respect of so-called
'objective' reality.",[190]
