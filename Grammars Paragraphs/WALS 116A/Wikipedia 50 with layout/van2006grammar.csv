      ‘They did not kill him then.’ (AR‐8MI‐33)The same strategy is used to negate nominal and adjectival constituents. Since
adjectives and nouns can function as predicates without any overt marking,
nominal (36)a and adjectival (36)b constituents can be negated in the same way as
verbs:(36) a       nish       ti‐bashti   ana
             NEG        1SG‐wife DEM
             ‘This is not my wife.’ (AY‐2NC‐6)

             NEG      good‐3 DEM=DIR earth
             ‘The earth is not good over there.’ (AR‐8MI‐58)Adverbs (37)a and postpositional phrases (37)b can be negated by placing the
negative adverb nish/nij before the whole verb phrase (verb + adjuncts).(37) a       nish    [achu     imbëtë‐shta‐ø=w=ya]
             NEG     like.that behave‐FUT‐3=PL=NVR

             ‘They did not cry loudly.’     (AY‐3NC‐9)Auxiliaries are negated in the same way, by placing nish/nij before the auxiliary +
main verb:(38) nish   [poyde danda‐ø]=ja       mala‐ø
      NEG   [can      go.up‐3]=SS    go.SG‐3
      ‘When he could not go up, he went (away).’ (AY‐3NC‐8)A special construction with the negative adverb nish/nij involves the limited
degree marker ‐mash:

            ‘You did not even harvest a little manioc!’ (OR‐19MA‐29)This combination of the negator and ‐mash indicates absolute negation. It can be
literally translated with ‘not (even) a little’.
   The independent form nij‐ta consists of the negative adverb nish/nij and the
middle marker ‐tA, and marks existential negation. It is not associated with a
predicate or VP it negates; rather it functions as a predicate itself:(40) a      nij‐ta‐jti‐ø=ya        emme
            NEG‐MID‐HAB‐3=NVR      meat

            NEG‐MID‐3=PL=NVR 3SG.P‐son:PL
            ‘Her sons were not there.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)Interrogative clauses can be divided into yes/no questions and question‐word
questions. Yes/no questions are structurally not very deviant from declarative
sentences, they differ mainly in pitch:(41) a      yokkoshe tiya‐m             mem=la
            truly          eat‐2SG.S mother=VAL

        c   mi‐tulu        a‐tëbë‐ø
            2SG‐lip        INC‐bleed‐3
            ‘Is your lip bleeding?’ (FL‐27MA‐9)Yes/no questions are only marked by the fact that the clause final stressed syllable
gets a higher pitch, indicated in (41) by means of italics.
  Question‐word questions are somewhat different structurally. The three
question words ama ‘what, which (N)’, tëtë ‘what which (A)’ and ëshë ‘why’ 11 must
occur in clause initial position and can only be preceded by setting‐constituents
such as subordinate clauses, (42)a and b, communicative verbs, (42)b, discourse
linkers, (42)c, etc.:11   Question words are discussed in sections 4.4.4 and 4.5.2.","[301, 302, 303]"

aloud, often translatable with ‘let’s see’, ‘I wonder’, or ‘possibly’:

         ‘What could I possibly do?’(OR‐20MA‐5)The enclitic =ri/yu here marks that question as rhetorical, not really expecting an
answer to the question. It is not really clear what element of meaning =bë adds, but
with the rhetorical questions marked with =jtë and =yu (cf. example (30) above),
the speaker seems to be somewhat more acquiescent to the fact that he does not
know the answer to the question.
  If we take the combinatory possibilities of the expressive particles into
consideration, we can come up with the following template:                Table 44 - Combinatory possibilities of expressive modals
             la ‘validational’   se ‘se’                 ri/yu ‘expressive’
             bë ‘momentaneous’                           ra/yeThe aspectual enclitics =naja and =bëla seem to compete with =la over the same
position, since I have found no combinations of those enclitics.
  Of course, it has to be borne in mind that the combinations of the different
modal enclitics are infinitely more complicated that this. Apart from the fact that I
did not find all logical possibilities, there are also possible combinations between
the three groups of event‐related, epistemic and expressive modality that may
yield their own specific interpretation. However, further research is necessary to
study all these possible combinations. The data in this section are merely intended
to show that combinations even within one modality group are possible and that
they can yield rather specialized meanings.","[279, 280, 281]"
"The question word amaThere are three basic question words in Yurakaré: ama ‘which, what, who’, ëshë ‘why’
and tëtë ‘what’. Of these three only ama is nominal; tëtë is adjectival and ëshë is
adverbial.
 The question word ama can combine with a number of markers to form new question
words:(123) ama          ‘which, what, who’
      ama=ti       ‘where’
      am=chi       ‘whereto’
      ama=jsha     ‘from where’
      am‐ti        ‘how much/many’
      ama=la       ‘with what, using which way, why’
      ama‐sh(ku)   ‘how’Day (1980) mentions a further nominal question marker aa ‘who’:(124) aa     a‐pojore        ati
      who    3SG.P‐canoe     DEM
      ‘Whose canoe is that?’ [DAY‐1980‐1]This marker is not used very often in the areas that I worked in at the time of my
fieldwork. Instead, ama is used to express ‘who’:

Propositional markers
  Questions marked with the validational marker are often closed questions,
where the speaker is asking for commitment of the addressee to the truth value of
the proposition. Consider the following question‐answer pair:(33) a    yokkoshe         tiya‐m        meme=la
          true             eat‐2SG.S mother=VAL
          ‘“Did you really eat it, mother?”’ (AR‐8MI‐25)
      b   tiya‐y=la            tiya‐y=la         mu‐ta‐ø=ya
          eat‐1SG.S=VAL        eat‐1SG:S=VAL 3PL.CO‐say‐3=NVR
          ‘“I did eat it, I did eat it!”, she said to them.’ (AR‐8MI‐25)In (33)a the speakers ask for commitment of the addressee to the truth of the
proposition by using the validational marker =la. The addressee then gives them
the commitment by means of the same marker =la in (33)b. The factual status of
the proposition here is that it is not true, as we, the hearers of the narrative know.
  The affirmative marker on an imperative, jussive or exhortative adds pertinence
to the assignment. The speaker is commited to the realization of the event,
comparable to English emphasized ‘you have to do this’:(34) a    mala‐cha‐m=la        an    püü=la
          go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S=VAL DEM road=INS
          ‘You really must go and take that road.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)
      b   dula‐n‐tu=la               pi‐ama             ta‐bata‐ø=ya         samma

          ‘Come on! We have to make [a boat]; the water is going to take us!’ (OR‐20MA‐1)In (34)a, the validational marker is not on the final element of the clause, possibly
to avoid doubling of the syllable la.
  The clitic =la does not indicate an absolute value of certainty. It is rather a value
that can be played with when telling a story, making the listeners believe that
something actually did happen (35)a, denying it after that in (35)b:

           ‘He was not going to eat them, however. When he followed them, they went
           away, when he tried to grab them they had gone, and ‘dup’ he grabbed after
           them, they went screaming ‘hehehe’. (OR‐19MA‐3)The validational marker can also be used to indicate the belief of a speaker in a
conditional, hypothetical, even counterfactual situation:(36) ati    ka‐puppu‐ta ‐ø            bobo‐ø=ya=chi        laij=la=ye
     DEM 3SG‐make.loose‐POT‐3         hit;kill‐3=NVR=IGN too=VAL=NB.F
     ‘If he had cut that one loose, he would have killed him as well.’ (FA‐6MA‐11)This is perhaps the clearest example to show that =la has nothing to do with
factuality. The speaker knows that the event described in the superordinate clause
of the counterfactual conditional construction is non‐factual, and still the
proposition is marked with =la.
  In a similar vein the validational marker can be combined with the speculative
marker ‐jtë and the assumptive marker =tiba:(37) a     lat mapa‐kka‐ø       ati‐kka‐ø=jtë       latiji=la=yu
           then big‐MEA‐3       DEM‐MEA‐3=SPC       subsequently=VAL=EXPR.F
           ‘He was big. Probably this size.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
     b     a‐wështi‐ø=tiba=la=ye
           3SG.P‐hunger‐3=ASM=VAL=NB.F
           ‘He must have been hungry.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)In (37)a the speaker commits herself to her estimation of the height of the character
of the story, and in (37)b the narrator commits herself to her assumption that the
character is hungry.
7.2.2 =ri/yu: expressive
The enclitic pair =ri (for men) and =yu (for women) adds an expressive force to an
utterance, which can often be translated with English interjectional phrases like                                           248
Propositional markers
“for God’s sake”, “for crying out loud” and the like. In the data that I have
collected, these enclitics mainly occur in questions which are furthermore marked
with the speculative marker ‐jtë:(38) a    am=chi      mala‐ø=jtë      latiji=ri
          WH=DIR      go.SG‐3=SPC     subsequently=EXPR.M
          ‘Where (in the world) did he go.’ (AR‐8MI‐59)
      b   ama‐sh‐i‐ø=jtë=yu
          WH‐ADV‐VBL‐3=SPC=EXPR.F
          ‘How will it have been? (I don’t know)’ (DV‐14MA‐3)The combination of ‐jtë and =ri/yu marks the question as an expressive one. No
answer is expected to either of the questions in (38). In (38)a, the narrator of the
story does not know where the main character of the story went, and he knows
that no one has the answer to that question. Example (38)b is from a dialogue
where the speaker and her husband are trying to track down where one of their
plates has gone. After contemplating some of the possibilities, they come to the
conclusion that they do not know what might have happened, and the utterance
in (38)b is her final word.
  The enclitics =ri and =yu in questions are also sometimes combined with the
enclitic =bë, which denotes either momentaneous aspect or demanding attention of
the hearer (cf. 7.2.5 below). In the case of a combination of =bë with one of the
expressive enclitics, the question is also expressive, but with the connotation of
pondering, thinking aloud:(39) a    tëtëpshë       kusu‐shta‐ø=bë=ri             enriki=ri
          what‐entity    want‐FUT‐3=MOM=EXPR.M         Enrique=EXPR.M

          ‘What shall we talk about?’ (AA‐27MA‐9)In (39)a, taken from the same dialogue as (38)b, the two speakers are wondering
what I would like to have for lunch. This speaker is asking himself aloud what
would please me. In (39)b, taken from another dialogue, I had left the two
speakers with the minidisk and told them to just go ahead and converse. So the
first speaker asks himself rather than anyone else: “What shall we talk about? (let’s
see)”.
  The following utterances show that =ri/yu can be applied in a wider context than
just rhetorical questions:

         chief‐INTL:1SG.S     1SG.PRN=MOM=EXPR.M
         ‘If only I were chief!’ [FL‐1MA‐21]The utterance in (40)a is part of the dialogue of the lost plate mentioned before.
This is an answer to a statement made by the other speaker who thinks that they
had two white plates, a plastic one and another one, but his wife says that the
plastic one is the only one they have. In (40)b there is an expression of a wish,
where =ri , possibly in combination with =bë, adds an exclamative value to the
proposition.
  Day (1980) has found many more occurrences of =ri/yu. In her analysis, these
suffixes express regret or sorrow:(41) a   benebene‐sh tuwi‐ø          i‐bonto‐shama=ri
         pitiful‐ADV    die.SG‐3     1SG‐son‐PST=EXPR.M

         ‘Why didn’t I go out earlier?’ (regretful) (Day 1980‐32)However, regret and sorrow are too narrow labels to fit to the whole range of uses
of =ri/yu. I will come back to these enclitics and discuss some more environments
in which they occur when discussing combinations of the modal enclitics in 7.3
below.
7.2.3 =ra/ye: notable information
There is another set of enclitics that differ according to the gender of the speaker:
=ra (for men) and =ye (for women). The function of these enclitics is also hard to
pinpoint, but they seem to mark the fact that the speaker thinks something is
notable for some reason:(42) a   media     ora‐nñu‐jti       kusu‐ø=naja  pëpë=ra
         half      hour‐DIM‐LIM      want‐3=DSC   grandfather=NB.M
         ‘Half an hour the old one wanted (mind you).’ (FL‐14MA‐1)
     b   shülül‐ta     mi‐dojo     më=ra
         tickly‐MID    2SG‐body 2SG.PRN=NB.M
         ‘Your body is tickly’ (FL‐14MA‐1)
                                            250
Propositional markers
In (42)a I had told the speaker that they should converse for half an hour. When
during the conversation the speaker starts wondering when it would end, he
reminds his interlocutor that I had said half an hour. In (42)b the speaker touches
the body of his daughter and she starts to laugh, so he remarks that she has a
tickly body. The ‘notable information’ function becomes clearer in the following
example of Day (1980):(43) matat‐uma‐ø=w=la mesa=w=ye
     big‐DST‐3=PL=VAL      table=PL=NB.F
     ‘What huge tables!’ [DAY‐1980‐32]Sometimes the use of =ra/ye seems to have an epistemic value. It is not clear how
this use is related to the ‘notable information’ use:(44) rene=tina     bali‐ø=w=ra
     Rene=COM go.PL‐3=PL=NB.M
     ‘They will have gone with Rene.’ (FL‐14MA‐2)7.2.4 =se: repetition/emotion
The enclitic =se has several functions. So many in fact, that it is virtually
impossible to come up with an adequate characterization of the enclitic, therefore I
gloss it ‘SE’.
  First of all, =se marks repetition, which is essentially aspectual, and can often be
translated with English ‘again’. In this reading the enclitic seems to be related to
the adverb yosse ‘again’:(45) a     yosse ma‐dula‐ø=ja          ma‐otche‐ø=ya=se              a‐tomte=w

      b    mala‐m=chi=se
           go.SG‐2SG.S=IGN=SE
           ‘Go again!’ (OR‐20MA‐2)It is also used to mark an object with which something is compared:(46) ana    a‐sibë          a‐techo=se       ati‐kki        ma‐ssë‐ø=w
     DEM 3SG.P‐house        3SG.P‐roof=SE DEM‐MEA:LOC 3PL‐stand‐3=PL
     ‘Like the roof of his house. At that hight [the hive] was hanging.’ (FL‐14MA‐1)
                                             251
A grammar of Yurakaré
Furthermore, =se denotes an amalgam of different emotions and other modal or
textual uses. To give an impression of the many shades of meaning =se can convey,
I will just show a number the functions of =se that I have found:Conviction/protest(47) poyde‐tu=la=se

     ‘Don’t follow me, they might kill him [your nephew].’ (OR‐20MA‐8)In these contexts (i.e. between the potential marker ‐ta and =se) an element ‐j‐
appears. It is not clear what the function of this element is. It is not always
connected to apprehension:Insight(51) nentaya   ta‐lele=w           emejeme‐sh       ma‐n‐kukku‐ta‐ø‐j=se

second syllable is stress attracting. The stress pattern simply follows general
prosodic rules outlined in section 2.4.1 above, which say that the stress pattern of
Yurakaré words follow an iambic pattern starting from the left side of the word,
provided that the ultimate syllable be unstressed.(29) mata mala          ‘big’
     matatima 8         ‘big (collective)’
     shuyu mala         ‘beautiful’
     shuyulima          ‘beautiful (collective)As can be seen in (29), the first syllables of mata(ta) and shuyu(lë) can be stressed.
They can receive primary or secondary stress.
  The case of the question word ama is deviant in this respect. There is no clear
explanation for the behavior of ama. The only observation that can be reported
here is that the question word ama behaves in unpredictable ways when followed
by an enclitic or suffix:                         Table 13 ‐ stress patterns of question words

potatoes. When he comes back he realizes that his prisoner Aysa has escaped. In
(24)b, the speaker has been suspecting his mother of doing things in secret, so he
decides to spy on her. Then he understands what it is she has been doing secretly
all this time (having an affair with the sun).
  Taking all the examples with =laba into consideration there is at this point no
clear answer to the question what the exact meaning is of =laba. It refers to
presupposition, counterfactuality, doubt, subjectivity, evaluation. I consider
subjectivity to be the central notion, especially since it is congruent with the fact
that translations in elicitation tasks were often marked with =laba, especially with
less confident speakers, indicating the opinion and doubt of the consultant.
Nevertheless, further research is needed to obtain a better understanding of this
enclitic.
7.1.4 =tiba: assumptive
The enclitic =tiba is not used very often. It expresses doubt on the part of the
speaker. Formally, it seems related to =laba. There may be a separate morpheme
=ba, but the evidence is too thin to draw any firm conclusions. The enclitic =tiba is
often translated with ‘I think’.(25) a    tënnij       ana=jsha i‐tanti‐ø=la       bëjta‐ø=tiba   a‐shuyye=jsha=ti=ye

          3SG.P‐hunger‐3=ASM=VAL=NB.F
          ‘I suppose he was really hungry.’(OR‐19MA‐9)In these examples, the evidence for the truth values of these assertions is indirect.
In (25)a, the main character Tiri is trying to kill a Puydara with his arrow, but
somehow this Puydara notices this in time and manages to escape. The narrator                                           243
A grammar of Yurakaré
assumes that the animal noticed Tiri because Puydaras are generally known to
have had eyes in the back of their head. Note that on the final word there is an
element =ti as well, which may be an indication that the element =ti in =tiba has a
separate meaning. The element =ye will be discussed in 7.2.3 below. In (25)b, the
odd behaviour of Noah (telling everyone that it is going to rain heavily and that
all will be destroyed) leads the speaker of this utterance to his conclusion. In (25)c,
finally, the narrator assumes that one of the characters of the story must have been
really hungry, because he ate peleltas, a type of fruit normally only eaten by
monkeys.
7.1.5 =bala: admonitive
The enclitic =bala occurs even less frequently than =tiba. It is normally found on
verbs that express some kind of warning (cf. Day 1980‐32). I have heard only one
example of this:(26) mi‐munë‐shta‐ø=bala sasta
     2SG‐prick‐FUT‐3=ADM sugarcane
     ‘The sugarcane will sting you! (watch out)’ (FA‐PC)This utterance was made when the consultant and I were doing translation work.
While we were working she saw her grandson playing with the sugarcanes, so she
warned him to watch out for the spines of the sugarcane.
 The suffix =bala is also discussed in Day (1980), exclusively with the
admonishing function:(27) a   danda‐yu      dele‐shta‐m=bala
         go.up‐PROH fall.SG‐FUT‐2SG.S=ADM
         ‘Don’t climb up, you might fall.’ [DAY‐1980‐32]
     b   kayashi‐shta‐m=bala
         shoot‐FUT‐2SG.S=ADM
         ‘(Quit aiming at those chickens) you might hit one.’ [DAY‐1980‐32]As mentioned above, it may be possible to isolate the element =ba as having a
meaning of its own. If we would do that, the enclitics =laba and =bala would both
be combinations of the validational marker =la (cf. section 7.2.1 below) and =ba.
The order would then reflect scope, =laba meaning ‘I think that really X’ and =bala
‘I really think that X’. So in example (26) the translation would be ‘I really think
that the sugarcane will prick you’ and in example (20), repeated here, the
translation would be ‘I think that the trees really have come out.’

     3PL‐go.out‐3=SBJ     go.out tree
     ‘Possibly the trees have come out.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)In this reading the element =ti of =ti=ba would mean something like deduction, or
an evidential suffix indicating that the evidence for the assertion comes from
context. Again, further research is needed to investigate this possibility further.
7.1.6 =jtë: speculative
The marker =jtë marks speculation on the part of the speaker. It is mostly
combined with gender‐based clause final markers =ri (men) or =yu (women). I will
come back to these below in section 7.2.2. The enclitic =jtë in declarative clauses
indicates that the speaker is making a guess or estimation, without having any
evidence for it:(29) la=mapa=kka ati‐kka=jtë           latiji=la=yu
     SEQ=tall=MEA DEM‐MEA=SPC          subsequently=VAL=EXPR.F
     ‘He was tall then, he will have been about this size, I guess.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)This enclitic is mostly found in interrogative clauses. It has the effect that it turns
the question into an expressive one, where the speaker does not expect an answer:(30) a     am=chi       mala‐ø=jtë     latiji=ri
           WH=DIR       go.SG‐3=SPC    subsequently=EXPR.M

           ‘I don’t see them, where could they be?’When the enclitic =jtë is used in combination with =ri/=yu in a question, it means
that the speaker has no clue as to the answer of the question, and no answer to the
question is expected. This is generally what =jtë expresses: lack of evidence.","[257, 258, 259, 260]"

Verbal agreement, voice & valency
Kukku can also carry other subject markers than third person singular:(50) ti‐n‐kukku‐m
     1SG‐IO‐nice‐2SG
     ‘I like you.’ [FL‐3MA‐5]Other experiencer predicates behaving like this are, among others: ñolele ‘desirable’,
sheta ‘lost’ pëlë ‘finished’, benebene ‘lamentable’, shujuta ‘hot’, and dyummë ‘cold’.
  Problematic for this analysis are kusu 11 ‘want’ and ile ‘know’. These verbs do not
occur as one‐place predicates, nor do they take any phonetically salient subject
markers 12, a fact which renders an analysis as two‐place predicates problematic. These
verbs are probably best analyzed as impersonal verbs or as one‐place verbs with non‐
canonically marked subjects. In fact, Malchukov (in prep.) suggests that constructions
with non‐canonically marked subjects can in fact come about as reanalyses of
impersonal constructions. This historical change may be corroborated by the fact that
Day (1980‐40) 13 marks the following utterances as grammatical:(51) a    nish     ta‐jusu‐m
          NEG      1PL‐want‐2SG.S

          ‘Which songs do you (pl) know?’When confronted with these examples, consultants rejected them as ungrammatical. It
may be that in the regions I worked the construction has been reanalyzed.
  I should also mention a handful of examples where the experiencer is a possessor (cf.
also section 4.4.1):
11 Kusu is the underlying form which changes to jusu when preceded by a vowel.
12 Note that third person plural subject on kusu is also phonetically non‐salient, since the
element =w is not audible on a stem ending in /u/.
13 Even though Day printed her material in 1980, she has been working with the Yurakarés sincethe 1950s. The fact that for the most part, she worked in other areas than I did may have
something to do with this too.","[178, 179, 180]"
"
Possibly, when there is a choice of stress, as is often the case with the question
words (cf. the discussion in section 3.2.3), the reduplication process depends on
which choice has been made for the stress of the stem.
  Apart from deriving a number of descriptive adjectives, partial suffixal
reduplication serves two functions: distributive or causation. In the distributive
function it is the initial syllable of the root that is reduplicated. Causation is
normally also marked by reduplicating the first rather than the last syllable, but
both occur. Verbal distributive/repetitive mostly combines with the prefix i‐
‘verbal plural’ (discussed in section 6.2.2):
8Stress falls on the penultimate syllable here, since underlying, the syllable is heavy:
matata‐yma, shuyulë‐yma. The secondary stress on the first syllable is the result of stress‐
clash resolution, avoiding two adjacent stressed syllables.",[72]

tibanti means ‘two times my hands’ (the suffix ‐juta is still used to form numeral
adverbs from cardinal numerals) and sata in lassie sata means ‘to be finished or
terminated’. Ca‐sata for 100 means ‘to be finished with it’; the ‐ve suffix is the same as
the collective plural marker ‐ybe discussed below.
  The counting in the more recent data from Day (1991) is done in a somewhat
different way: not by leaving out fingers, but by adding fingers, where apparently one
of the fingers (possibly the thumb or the little finger) does not count, so lëtta tësë (one is
standing) for seven, actually means that two are standing, plus the other hand, and so

hand’.
  Numerals can undergo several morphological operations. The most common is the
addition of the suffix combination ‐ju‐ta ‘frequency’ and ‘middle voice’:(139) a   lëshie‐ju‐ta
          two‐FRQ‐MID
          ‘twice’
     b    siete‐ti‐ju‐ta
          seven‐QN‐FRQ‐MID
          ‘seven times’This use of the numerals can be made personal (data from Day 1980‐28):(140) a   ti‐n‐lëttu‐ju
          1SG‐IO‐one‐FRQ
          ‘once for me’
     b    ti‐n‐nishi‐ju
          1SG‐IO‐two‐FRQ
          ‘twice for me’
     c    ti‐n‐niwi‐ju
          1SG‐IO‐three‐FRQ
          ‘three times for me’
     d    ti‐n‐napshu‐ju
          1SG‐IO‐four‐FRQ
          ‘four times for me’In a phrase:(141) ta‐n‐lëttu‐ju    bali‐tu    uwal‐chi

          1SG‐IO‐two=PL=FRQ
          ‘I do it twice.’[MH‐25MA‐9]
      b   ti‐n‐lëpshu‐j‐ta
          1SG‐IO‐four:PL‐FRQ‐MID
          ‘I do it four times.’ [MH‐25MA‐9]In (142), the numerals are made plural, and occur with the element /l/. Example (142)b,
moreover, contains both the indirect object prefix and the middle marker. The
translation is ‘to do something X times’.
  Numerals can also be prefixed with the passive comitative applicative. In this way
adverbs of time are formed (data from Day 1980‐28):(143) ti‐lëtta    ‘one day for me/it takes me one day’
      ka‐shie     ‘two days for me/it takes me two days’Many of these features seem to have been lost, at least in the areas that I have worked
in, since the consultants I worked with do not accept the forms in (140)‐(143).
Interestingly, in constructions like the ones in (140) and (143), numerals 2‐4 lose their
initial l‐. It is therefore very probably that this l‐ used to be a prefix, possibly related to
delimitative li‐. 31
  The marker ‐(j)cha on numerals and quantifiers indicates that the number refers to the
complete collection:(144) a   lëshie‐p=cha       pa‐dayu=ya                 pa‐bati

compounded with the form ‐pshë, which is short for bëshëë. The noun bëshëë can be used
independently, in which case it most often means ‘clothes’, ‘animals’, ‘stuff’. Bëshëë
compounded with other words means ‘the one who (is) X’:
 It is also possible that the same element is present in lëmmuy ‘only, just; in vain’. The second
31part is probably the same as mumuy/mumay ‘all’.","[154, 155, 156]"

=se means ‘again’ and (46), where =se is used in comparisons do not contain the
same morpheme as in (47)‐(60), where =se mainly adds emotional value.
Furthermore, it is not clear how to account for the range of inferences in (47)‐(60).
7.2.5 =bë: momentaneous/attention particle
The meaning of the enclitic =bë is hard to pinpoint. It seems to have two different
meanings, and is often used in conversation in various circumstances.
  In many circumstances, the particle means ‘for a while’, like in (61)a and b,
indicating that the event will take up only a short while. In this sense it is an
aspectual marker. However, in example (61)c, this interpretation is harder to                                             254
Propositional markers
maintain. It rather seems to mean something like getting attention, somewhat like
English ‘hey!’. In this sense it is a particle that functions on the speech‐act level as
an address particle.(61) a    ushpë‐shti          enrike=bë
          bathe‐FUT:1SG.S     Enrique=MOM

jussives and exhortatives. The momentaneous interpretation is possible in (62)c,
but not in (62)a and b, where the attention drawing function seems to be more in
place.
  The enclitic =be is also often found on questions:(63) a    tëp     yaju‐p=bë

                                            255
A grammar of Yurakaré
It is not entirely clear in these sentences what =bë adds to the meaning of the
sentence. Only in (63)a the speaker directly addresses someone, (63)b and c the
question is rather rhetorical, which does not match with the use of an addressing
particle, nor does there seem to be a straightforward momentaneous
interpretation.
  Finally, the enclitic particle is also found on declaratives:(64) a   lat ma‐la‐wismë‐ø=ti               itele‐ø=w=ya      yosse=bë
         then 3PL‐AFO‐hit.with.st‐3=DS let.go‐3=PL=NVR        again=MOM

         ‘Tiri had not yet been born at that moment.’ (AR‐8MI‐9)

         arrive.SG‐3=SS     hit;kill‐3=NVR     3SG.P‐wife=MOM
         ‘When he arrived, he gave his wife a beating.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)The interpretation that can be given here is ‘at that specific moment’. This is
especially clear in example (64)b, where the speaker realizes that he has made a
mistake in talking about Tiri at that specific moment in the story, because he had
not been born yet. In (64)a and c, reference is made to a specific, relatively short
period in time where background clauses mark the circumstances associated with
that period of time. In (64)a, during the period that the subject of the background
clause was hitting them, they let the object go; in (64)c, the moment of arriving
coincides with the slapping.
  Summarizing, =bë is used to indicate specific points in time, which go with
specific circumstances, or it indicates that the speaker demands attention from the
addressee. Possibly, these two uses are connected in the sense that =bë tells us that
the speaker regards what he says to be relevant for the moment of utterance, but
not in general. However, whether and, if so, how these two uses are related
remains unclear; a definite answer to this question can only be given after
substantial further research.
  What can be said, however, is that the form =bë can be found in other words of
the language, like bëbë ‘search’ and bëjta ‘see’, as well as the special attention
demonstrative pronouns bëti and bëna, often used as a sort of presentative (cf.
section 4.4.4). These correlate mainly with the ‘attention’ meaning of bë.
7.2.6 =bëla: continuative
The enclitics =bëla and =naja are phasal enclitic particles. Phasal particles express
‘that a state does or does not continue, or that is has or has not come into
existence’ (Van der Auwera 1998:24). The enclitic =bëla indicates that a certain state                                          256
Propositional markers
of affairs continues to be true or, when attached to a negative clause, that an
expected event still has not been realized. In the first case it can often be translated
with English ‘still’, in the latter case with ‘not yet’. The form =bëla is probably
related to =bë.(65) a    ta‐la‐banna‐ø=bëla ta‐pü

          NEG      see‐3=PL=NVR      DEM    brother=PL=CNT
          ‘His brothers had not yet seen him.’     (FA‐6MA‐6)In (65)a and b, there is a declarative sentence marked with the continuative
enclitic, which indicates that the general situation does not change, and the old
one is still valid. In (65)a the situation was and still is that the road has to be built.
It is not finished yet. In (65)b, the speaker is talking about Noah’s journey in his
ark. There is a moment of hope that the water is subsiding, but in the end they
have to continue their journey by boat. In (65)c and d, the negation of the clause
changes the interpretation of =bëla from ‘still’ to ‘not yet’, or ‘still not’. In (65)c,
Noah’s parrot says to him that he can still see no trees coming out of the water,
indicating that the water has subsided. In (65)d the topical participant of the story,
Tiri, has been hidden to escape from the view of his dangerous step‐brothers. At
this point in the story his brothers have not discovered him yet, but they will
shortly.
  As can be seen in the examples, =bëla does not always attach to the clause final
element. It is rather free in its placement.
7.2.7 =naja: discontinuative
The enclitic =naja, like =bëla is a phasal particle. However, whereas =bëla indicates
that a certain situation is continuing, =naja indicates that a new situation has
arisen, ending the previous state of affairs. It can often be translated with English
‘already’.","[268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"
"There is a construction that can be viewed as a syntactic compound of an adjective and

          ‘big stones’The marker ‐ima appears on modifying elements only (see 3.3.2 and 4.2 above). The fact
that collective ‐ima appears on the verb here indicates that we are dealing with a
modifier phrase [matata ka‐mala]‐ima. On the other hand, the verb shows suppletion for
number, which is associated with predication. Semantically, it is not clear what the use
of mala/bali adds.",[152]
"
6.1 Tense
Tense, aspect and mood, as in most languages, are not easily teased apart in Yurakaré.
In fact, it is questionable whether the language actually cares about these distinctions at
all. The distinction the language is sensitive to rather seems to be whether an event is
factual and/or specific or not (cf. section 7.1.1). Often very detailed analyses are needed
to be able to say whether a certain marker is e.g. a future marker or a modal marker (cf.
Comrie 1989b: 63). Even for a language such as English there are still many
controversies concerning this topic. Even though boundaries between tense, mood and
aspect are not very clear‐cut in Yurakaré, in their use markers that fall into this field
incline towards one of these three categories. Based on these tendencies, I maintain the
traditional three‐way distinction in this grammar. The labels that I give to markers that
fall into this general field should be regarded in this light. Further research may reveal
that we should reconsider the labels. For now, however, I will use the labels as
described here.
  The morphological tense system of Yurakaré is future versus non‐future: The
language has only one morphological tense marker: ‐shta, which indicates future tense:(1)   a    tishilë bobo‐y           ti‐tib   talipa
           now       hit;kill‐1SG.S 1SG‐pet chicken
           ‘I just killed my chicken.’ [AA‐25MA‐1]
      b    tishilë mi‐la‐bobo‐shta‐tu
           now       2SG‐AFO‐hit;kill‐FUT‐1PL.S
           ‘Now we are going to kill him on you!’ (AR‐8MI‐32)The difference between the temporal interpretation of (1)a and b is solely due to the
future tense marker.
  The marking of future with the suffix ‐shta is or can be relative to a certain anchor
point which is given by the context (relative tense):
                                            181

          INC‐bathe‐3=PL=DS    3PL‐eat‐FUT‐3
          ‘When they were bathing, he was going to eat them.’ (OR‐19MA‐3)In these examples the anchorpoint, or point of reference, is a point that lies before the
present moment. When an event takes place after that reference moment, like daybreak
in (2)a and the (start of the) bathing in (2)b, it is marked with ‐shta, even though the
event precedes the present moment.
  Apart from the tense marker ‐shta, Yurakaré has other means to place events on a
time line, the main ones being modality and aspect markers with temporal implications
(cf. sections 6.2 and 6.3), temporal adverbs (cf. section 6.5) and subordination with
temporal implications (cf. section 8.2.7).
  There is some debate about how one can distinguish future tense from modal
distinctions involving irrealis (cf. Comrie 1985:43‐48, 1989b), especially since, cross‐
linguistically, future markers are often found in modal context (cf. Lyons 1977, quoted
in Palmer 2001:105), and on the other hand, modal forms often have a future time
reference (Palmer 2001:105‐106). Indeed it is sometimes hard to determine whether ‐
shta is a modal marker or a tense marker:(3)   a   më=ja             ma‐ujwa‐shta‐m          ta‐lele=w
          2SG.PRN=EMPH 3PL‐look.at‐FUT‐2SG.S 1PL‐grandchild=PL

          ‘“Let’s go and see”, they said.’ (AR‐8MI‐23)In these examples, ‐shta seems to have a modal interpretation rather than a temporal
one. In (3)a it has a deontic interpretation (it is going to be the task of the subject to
watch over the grandchildren, whereas in (3)b it has an intentional, hortatory reading.
There are separate markers that could be used here: ‐cha ‘jussive’ in (3)a, and ‐ni
íntentional’ in (3)b; both markers will be discussed in section 6.3. As was observed by
Comrie (1989b), however, this is not a sufficient argument to reject a future tense
analysis. I will argue that future tense is the best interpretation for ‐shta because that is
the central element of meaning of this marker. The interpretation of it, however, is
somewhat obscured because of combinations with other, modal or aspectual, markers.
  We need to answer two questions to determine whether ‐shta is a tense marker or a
mood marker:
    - Is there future time reference without ‐shta?
    - Is there ‐shta without future time reference?","[196, 197]"

the roles that the main characters have. The subjects of (22)d‐f are pre‐verbal and
in contrastive focus.
  In general, then, we can say that VS is the pragmatically more neutral order;
preposing a subject gives some kind of emphasis to it. The fact that the pre‐verbal
position is pragmatically marked is corroborated by the fact that question words
are always sentence‐initial, regardless of their semantic or syntactic role (more
discussion on questions in the next section):(23) a       të‐pshë         li‐tütü‐ø     na     ashaa=chi              (subject)

             WH      3SG‐IO‐wash‐2SG.S=IGN
             ‘Who are you washing for?’ [VL‐24MA‐13]  As far as the position of objects is concerned, no clear preference for pre‐ or
postverbal position can be given in terms of frequency. Preverbal and postverbal
objects (O as well as E) occur in about equal proportions.
  Typological research in the past decades has revealed some rather strong
correlations between sentence word order and the order of words in other
constructions. In Table 50 I give Greenberg’s (1963) list, taken from Payne
(1997:72):

Table 50 shows that Yurakaré has a slight tendency to correlate with the O‐V type.
Nevertheless, these correlations are not very convincing and can never be
evidence in themselves for a basic order.
  Generally, preverbal objects are pragmatically marked as well:(24) a      bëshë yurujare‐tu         bëshë     a‐mumuy bëshë         kamba‐tu         ma‐mmuy

            ‘All of that our chief Tiri transformed before.’ (both: OR‐19MA‐20)In (24), the narrator is telling about the mythological ancestor of the Yurakaré, Tiri,
who used his magic to transform into jungle animals all kinds of objects and
creatures that he encountered during his wandering, so that the Yurakaré would
have meat. In the second line, the object ati amumuy is preposed, because it is a
marked topic, with a deictic function, referring back to the topic of the previous
sentence.
  In the following fragment, the object is emphasized (stressed) and fronted in the
final sentence of the example:
                                               282

      ‘Let’s make her chuchio, ehh jisopo and burn it first.’ (FL&DV‐14MA‐1)Generally, it seems that marked objects are found in initial position. Postverbal
objects can also refer to new and unpredictable information, but objects with extra
emphasis (focus), whether direct or applied, are found in preverbal position. The
fact that applied objects have a slight preference for being postverbal can be
explained by the fact that they are usually very topical (cf. Van Gijn 2005).
  The emphatic function of the preverbal position can also be seen in examples
such as the following, where the object NP is discontinuous (cf. section 4.1), the
modifier being in preverbal position, while the head noun is in postverbal
position:(26) lëshie=w ma‐bëjta‐y       shunñe=w
     two=PL      3PL‐see‐1SG.S man=PL
     ‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]This construction gives emphasis to the quantifier, while the head noun is
presented as a specification, or afterthought, possibly but not necessarily after a
pause. The quantifier is also stressed.
 Not very often both object and subject are overtly expressed. In the instances
where this was the case, I have encountered four word orders in texts:
                                           283

           ‘Aysa was looking for sabalo.’ (OR‐19MA‐11)I have found no instances of SOV or OSV. The reason that these are rare seems to
be connected to the tendency in the Yurakaré main clause for the verb to be
preceded by only one constituent. In analyzing the first 85 clauses of a text, I have
encountered only three instances where the verb was not in second or first place in
the clause. All kinds of constituents can precede the verb. In (27)a two ideophonic
particles precede the verb; in (27)b and c, two elements precede the verb. Consider
(28), where some other elements that can precede the verb are given:(28) a     ta‐dyuluta=la danda‐tu     tuwa               (PP‐phrase)
           1PL‐back=INS go.up‐1PL.S 1PL.PRN

           ‘They were standing there red (ripe).’ (AY‐3NC‐7)In almost all of the sentences that I examined in two texts, the verb was in either
initial or second position, preceded by all kinds of elements. In some instances, the
verb is in third place. This is also the case in the examples in (27)b and c. In these
circumstances, the first element is always a kind of setting marker, like latijsha
‘then’ pënchi ‘later’ ati ‘there’. These are elements that have a scope which is on the
level of the proposition. Subordinated clauses are also often in this position, often,
like setting words (adverbial elements setting the stage for a main event), marked
by an intonation break:(29) ati   shuju‐ø=ja an=chi woroj~wo‐ø=ya            latiji         ana a‐jorejto=chi

                                           284
The clause
If these subordinated sentences are not at the beginning of a proposition, they are
at the very end:(30) kwarenta dia kwarenta noche mashi‐ø=ja tom               wita‐ø     ashaa=chi

     ‘After raining 40 days and 40 nights, the water level had reached the sky when it
     took Noah’s boat’ (OR‐20MA‐1)Subordinated clauses marked by the enclitics =ja (cf. 8.2.3) and =ti (8.2.4) have a
different internal word‐order, generally. Overtly expressed arguments mostly
precede the predicate in these types of clauses:(31) na     ishete buybu ka‐n‐dyuju‐ø=ti lash         achama      lëtta    dia nish
      DEM   agouti word 3SG‐IO‐tell‐3=DS      then be.like.that one        day NEG
      wita‐ø=ya
      arrive.SG‐3=NVR
      ‘When the agouti told him the news, he did not come home for a day.’ (AR‐8MI‐49)Nevertheless, sometimes elements that belong to the subordinated clause can
appear to the right of the subordinating enclitic =ja (or =ti):(32) ku‐benemne‐ø              latiji          na   ta‐ppë           tiri bëjta‐ø=ja

     na      ishete     tejte
     DEM     agouti grandmother
     ‘Then Tiri felt sorry for the old agouti when he saw her.’ (AR‐8MI‐47)Leaving aside subordinated clauses, the data suggest that Yurakaré main clause
structure is V‐initial, with two positions before the verb, one position for setting
words, followed by an emphasis position, then followed by the verb. If we look at
how the elements after the verb are ordered, there is not a clear pattern, but
generally the most topical, known information is found rightmost. Adverbs and
adjuncts can intervene; adverbs related to the event are generally adjacent to the
verb, either to the left or to the right (cf. section 6.5.9 above). The following is a
continuous text fragment from the beginning of a text:

         ‘He carried with him a very small basket, this Pëpësu.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)Clause (33)a of the fragment is an existential‐presentative construction. The
subject, as expected, is in postverbal position. The adverb shinama generally
appears right after the verb. In (33)b the main new information in the form of an
adjunct is postverbal. The same adjunct in (33)c is the final element and old
information. The new information is the combination pëpëshamaw lacha, which
comes before the old information. In (33)d, the subordinate clause is preposed,
followed by a setting‐word latijsha and a preverbal subject with an extra emphasis
marker =ja introduces a new topic. In (33)e, finally, the emphasized element
anajalima is taken out of the object NP and positioned in the preverbal position.
The new object awerta comes right after the predicate, while the old information na
pëpësu is the final element. The template of the main clause, then, roughly looks as
in (34). Note that these are not absolute positions, but rather tendencies in the
clause.(34) (setting), emphasis, VP (pred. + adverbs), new information, topic, afterthought8.1.7 Negative and interrogative clauses
Negative clauses are marked by the negative adverb nish, with phonetic variant nij
(to negate a predicate or VP) or by the form nij‐ta (NEG‐MID; existential negation).
Nish/nij normally immediately precedes the predicate it negates:10Aysa and Pëpësu are two characters that are closely connected in this story in which they
work together. The reason the narrator started the story with Aysa is probably because I
asked him to tell the story of Aysa.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301]"

7.1 Verbal enclitics
The set of verbal enclitics indicate different types of epistemic modality; they tell
us something about how the speaker judges the truth value of the utterance. They
are often not mutually exclusive; rather they co‐occur, and do not denote different
points on a truth‐value scale.
7.1.1 =ya: non‐veridical
The marker =ya is the most frequently used propositional marker in narratives,
occurring virtually in every sentence. It has several functions, all revolving around
uncertainty of the speaker of the truth value of his utterance. It is not complete
uncertainty, however. When the speaker uses this marker, he usually has some
reason for assuming the proposition to be true. I use the term ‘non‐veridical’ in
this sense, i.e. the speaker makes a statement that may, but not necessarily does,
describe a realis situation. I will describe all functions of =ya that I have found so
far.
  The first function to discuss is that of reportative. Many statements in narratives,
especially in mythological texts, are marked with the enclitic =ya. Consider the
following sequence of events, in which a woman is hiding in the attic of a house of
Puydaras (jaguar‐like creatures), who suspect that there is someone in the attic:
                                         232

          ‘“Rü” he threw the woman out (they say).’ (all: FA‐6MA‐5)In (2), all verbs, except for dandanichi in (2)a and dandaja in (2)c are marked with
the non‐veridical marker. Dandanichi is direct speech, where this marker is usually
not found, and dandaja has the same‐subject marker =ja, which is incompatible
with =ya, as is the different‐subject marker =ti. Verbs marked with the hypothetical
marker are often translated with ‘they say that’. This can be linked to ‘non‐
veridical’ in the sense that all events talked about in a narrative exist in a fictitious
world of words only, and so they are essentially hypothetically, and not
necessarily true.
  Apart from its hearsay function, which is evidential in nature, =ya has other
functions, which are more in the realm of epistemic modality. Consider first the
following examples:(3)   a   aj     ashiwa‐ø=ya noe        li‐lojo‐ø=ya         noe
          INTJ lie‐3=NVR         Noah DEL‐mad‐3=NVR          Noah

          ‘This time they will not rescue themselves.’ (AY‐2NC‐10)
      c   maj~matata      ti‐jusu‐ø=la       nish    ta‐bibë‐shta‐ø=ya

          ‘I want a bigger one. This one won’t do for us.’ (AR‐8MI‐41)
      d   sawata‐ø=ya ani
          work‐3=NVR DEM:LOC
          ‘It seems to be working here.’ (AA‐27MA‐9)In example (3)a, taken from the Yurakaré version of the biblical tale of Noah, the
protagonist tries to convince his friends that they all should help him build an ark,
because the water will come and devastate everything. Since his friends don’t
believe him, they deduct that Noah is probably lying, that he has gone mad.
Example (3)b is taken from a text about the wrath of a mythological figure, ayma                                            233
A grammar of Yurakaré
shunñe (fire man), who burnt everything to the ground. Two people manage to
save themselves. He tells them to go and procreate. If they don’t do that, he
promises that he will come back and burn everything again. This time no one will
be saved. In (3)c, another mythological figure, Tiri (founder of the Yurakaré) has
made a field for his stepmother, but she deems it too small, assuming that it will
not be big enough to feed the both of them. In (3)d, finally, taken from a dialogue,
the speaker is looking at the mini‐disk recorder and sees movement in the display.
From this he deducts that it must be working.
  The examples in (3) cannot be translated with ‘reportative’ since they are not
dealing with hearsay information. Instead, they are assuming or hypothesizing
something to be true on the basis of some expectation they have. In this sense =ya
has a wider, and more epistemic function than just reportative.
  There are two further environments where =ya is found. In both of these it
stands in opposition with the same‐subject marker =ja. The first is:(4)   a   ta‐ñu            ma‐bëjta=ya        awëwë‐tu    chajtiya

          ‘When we go, maybe we will die.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)In each of these examples, we are dealing with two propositions that are
grammatically and conceptually integrated. The first predicate, which I consider
to be subordinate, or co‐subordinate, does not carry any subject marker or TMA
markers; instead it carries the marker =ya. The second predicate is a full‐fledged
verb, with subject markers and TMA markers. Constructions may be marked in
this way under two conditions: the subjects of the subordinate and main clause
should be identical, and the main verb should denote a non‐specific, non asserted
event. This means that the main verb in these constructions is typically marked for
habitual, jussive, imperative, future, intentional, etc. In (4)a, the main verb is not
morphologically marked for habitual, but it is modified with the adverb chajtiya,
which implies habituality. In (4)b, the main verb is marked for jussive, in (4)c for
                                          234
Propositional markers
imperative, and in (4)d, finally, the main verb is marked for future tense. A more
detailed account of these constructions is given in section 8.2.2 below.
  This use of =ya can be contrasted with the same‐subject marker =ja in similar
constructions. A predicate marked with =ja is normally encoded as having taken
place, a realis event, whereas the use of =ya in constructions such as (4) refers to an
irrealis event.(5)   a   la     bobo‐ø=w=ja        tiya‐ø=w

          ‘When I was going to bathe, I fell into the water.’ [RF‐30MA‐6]The subordinate predicates marked with =ja, which are fully inflected verbs, point
to a specific event, even in the case of (5)c, where the predicate is marked with the
future‐tense marker ‐shta. It refers to the moment before bathing. More on this and
related constructions can be found in section 8.2.3. A final construction involving
=ya is of the following type:(6)   a   mala‐cha‐m           mala=ya       kuta‐ø=ya
          go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S      go.SG=NVR 3SG.CO‐say‐3SG.S=NVR

          ‘When they arrive, do not fall in love with them.’(AR‐8MI‐21)In the same circumstances as the subordinate =ya clauses, i.e. when we are not
dealing with a specific or factual event, speakers often repeat the predicate, strip it
of its subject marking and TMA morphology, and mark it with =ya. The effect of
this repetition is that it gives a certain emphasis to the proposition. The type of
emphasis added can be diverse. In (6)a, the repetition of mala + ya marks a certain
impatience on the part of the speaker and coercion to carry out the request. The
second =ya is simply the narrative =ya treated above. The utterance is made at a                                            235
A grammar of Yurakaré
very dramatic moment in the story in which a man tells his wife that he is
ashamed of his face that has been damaged. He says that she must go her own
way and leave him. The effect of the repetition in (6)b is similar to that of (6)a, only
not so much coercive, but more anxious and longing. This is from the story of
Noah, where they have been on the ark for a long time, waiting for the trees to
come out of the water, which would indicate that the water is subsiding. In (6)c
and (6)d, the emphasis marks urgency and extra warning for potentially
dangerous situations.
  Other kinds of emphasis that can be indicated by repetition include despair (7)a,
astonishment (7)b, reassurance (7)c, and gravity of the situation or possibly
alerting of the hearer (7)d. Note that in the repetition of (7)d, the negation is left
out as well.(7)   a   tëtë‐pshë      dula‐shti=chi               dula=ya

have to indicate whether we are dealing with a specific, factual event or with a
non‐specific or non‐factual event. When a specific factual event is repeated, it
takes the marker =ja (cf. section 8.2.3):(8)   a   shuj~shudyulë‐sh        ti‐n‐wita‐m             ti‐n‐wita‐m=ja

Propositional markers
In the examples in (8), the repetition also adds some kind of emphasis. The
difference with the examples in (7) is that here, the predicate refers to a specific
event that has taken place or is taking place, or is believed to have taken place. The
kinds of emphasis here are reinforcement of happiness in (8)a, and urgent
demanding, in (8)b and c.
7.1.2 =chi: ignorative
The marker =chi 1 is most often found on questions. Questions are generally
marked with =chi when the speaker has no idea what the answer could be, and
s/he is open to any answer.(9)   a   ama=jsha amala‐m=chi            ti‐shoja             ku‐ta‐ø=ya

          ‘Where is she?’ (OR‐20MA‐8)The marker is found on predicates. Sometimes it is found on question words as
well, but in that case the question marker should be interpreted as a predicate:(10) tëtë‐pshë=chi       ati
     what‐entity=IGN     DEM
     ‘What is that?’ (AY‐3NC‐7)Another area where =chi is often found is with commands:
1The marker =chi may be related to the evidential/validational marker =chi in Quechua,
which expresses conjecture (Adelaar 1977: 79) or lack of conviction of the factual status of
the proposition (Weber 1989: 422).","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252]"

The verb phrase
With regard to the first question, there are some circumstances in which there is future
time reference without the use of the marker ‐shta:(4)   tëptë‐shta‐ø   hija       wita=ya          mentere      na=chi
      wash‐FUT‐3     daughter arrive.SG=NVR      meanwhile DEM=DIR
      mu‐chamashi‐tu        kormena=w
      3PL.CO‐be.busy‐1PL.S bee=PL
      ‘When our daughter arrives she will wash, while we occupy ourselves with the bees.’
                                                                                  (FL‐14MA‐1)Here the event of ‘occupying ourselves with the bees’ has future time reference, but no
future marker. This may be due, however to the borrowed co‐temporal marker mentere
‘meanwhile’ (< Sp. mientras). Apart from examples such as these, the use of the marker
‐shta for future time reference is quite meticulous, i.e. there are not many examples of
future time reference without ‐shta.
  Nevertheless, with reference to the second question, since ‐shta marks relative tense,
and since it can be combined with modal particles, there are quite a number of
examples where ‐shta is used without there being future time reference in the purest
sense:(5)   a   müta‐ø=w=ja che‐shta‐ø=w=chi nish               poyde tiya‐ø=w=ya latiji

          ‘They were about to die (but eventually didn’t).’ (AR‐8MI‐63)

          ‘Would it be true that it would hurt me?’ (AR‐8MI‐83)In (5)a‐d the events marked with ‐shta refer to a non‐actualized, irrealis situation. In all
of the examples, the future marker is combined with the ignorative marker =chi (or its
allomorph =yj) which indicates that the narrator cannot be sure whether the predicted
event would have actually taken place had the circumstances been more favorable. I
still maintain a future tense analysis here, since, from the vantage point of the moment
in the narrative, the irrealis event did have a future time reference. In the examples
(5)a‐c, however, something unexpected happened to prevent the normal, expected
developments from taking place. In (5)d, there is no intervening event, but the speaker                                            183
A grammar of Yurakaré
wants to find out whether his personal conviction, marked with =laba is true, namely
that a stingray would hurt him. Therefore he is going to test this. The future marker
here refers to the expected future time event where the speaker gets hurt by the
stingray. The point here is that we can maintain the future time reference analysis, and
that the modal interpretations are due to the modal enclitics. These enclitics will be
discussed in chapter 1.
  The future marker is not required for counterfactual constructions:(6)   nij     ka‐la‐bbë‐ti                oshewo    tiyu=y=chi           talipa=w    ti‐chata

      ‘If I hadn’t covered the pot, the chickens would have eaten all.’[MH‐31MA‐6]Here, there is no future tense marker, but the counterfactual reading is still there.
Apparently this reading is not dependent on the future marker. Rather, the future
marker in examples (5)a‐c indicates that at the time of the reference point one could
make a prediction that would hold at a later moment.
  Predicates not marked for tense can be interpreted either as past or as present. They
depend on their context and on aspectual (cf. 6.2) and modal (cf. 6.3) markers for their
temporal interpretation:(7)   a     tëtë‐pshë    dula‐m         ana=y       aysa
            what‐entity do;make‐2SG.S DEM=LOC       Aysa

            what‐entity 3SG‐PO‐go.SG‐2SG.S
            ‘What did you go up for?’ (OR‐19MA‐9)The two utterances in (7) directly follow each other in the narrative they are taken
from; both clauses are unmarked for tense. Still (7)a is interpreted as present tense,
while (7)b is interpreted as past tense. The only reason for this is the situational context,
and knowledge of the world. The hearer knows that the addressee Aysa is in a tree,
while the speaker, Pëpësu is on the ground, which permits the present tense reading of
(7)a, while it forces the past tense reading of (7)b.","[197, 198, 199]"

2.4.4 Disyllabic suffixes and enclitics and the stress window
If a stem is suffixed by a disyllabic suffix or enclitic, stress generally comes right
before that morpheme (if it is final), rather than on the suffix:

          NEG      1PL‐happen‐FUT=CNT
          ‘Nothing will happen to you yet.’ (AR‐8MA‐87)
      c   së́‐tina
          1SG.PRN=COM
          ‘with me’There are exceptions to this, as we will see, but the default rule is that stress does
not fall within a disyllabic suffix when that suffix is word‐final.
  The examples in (65)a and b show another prosodic property of Yurakaré.
Taking into account all the foregoing restrictions, one would expect forms like
timémeshama and tàpasáshtabëla. In (65)a and b, the stress patterns are constrained
by a stress window: primary stress in Yurakaré falls maximally two syllables to
the left of the right edge of a word. For compounds the same rule is valid:(66) a    wajá‐pëlë
          cow‐skin
          ‘cow‐hide’
     b    tàlipá‐newe
          chicken‐excrement
          ‘chicken‐dirt’The same can be said of reduplication, where the reduplication is disyllabic:(67) a    yutí~yuti     ‘capybara’
     b    bené~bene     ‘poor; sadly’In some cases stress is underlyingly not within the stress window, but a repair
strategy makes sure that it is within the stress window at surface level. Question
words have a very strong tendency to have their first syllable stressed. This can
lead to adaptations like the following:(68) und.     tëtë‐bëshë    >   surf.   të́tëpshë
13The marker ‐shama does not refer to clausal tense, it marks the fact that the object
referred to no longer exisits.","[56, 57]"

         ‘However did you guys get up there?’ (AY‐3NC‐8)The root in both examples is the question‐word ama. In (26)a the intensifying
prefix has a monosyllabic form, in (26)b it is disyllabic. Both stems begin with an
open, onsetless syllable, followed by a closed syllable. The difference between the
two stems is the stress pattern. The question word amakka has antepenultimate, or
in this case, initial stress, while amashku has stress on the penultimate, closed,
syllable.
  In the following examples, primary stress is indicated in boldface; the
reduplicated prefix always receives stress on its final syllable, which I term
pragmatic stress, this and secondary stress are in italics in the example:(27) a   shëwëj~shëwi‐shta‐ø=ti      ‘when it was really getting dark…’ (FA‐6MA‐5)
     b   malaj~ma‐la‐wita‐ø=ya       ‘She really had the urge [to urinate]: i.e.: the
                                       urine really arrived upon her.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)
     c   meyej~meyeye‐ø=w            ‘They were really disobedient.’ (AR‐8MI‐65)In (27)a, the stem (excluding the reduplicative prefix) has no stress on either the
first or second syllable, while in (27)b, the second syllable has secondary stress,
and in (27)c, the second syllable has primary stress. We cannot account for these
facts by assuming a rule like ‘copy the first syllable if it is stressed or the first two
if the initial syllable is unstressed’, because of examples such as the following:(28) a   maj~matata        ‘really big’
     b   shuj~shuyulë      ‘really beautiful’In (28)a and b, the first syllable of the stem is unstressed. Still, only the first
syllable gets copied. Which part (the first or the first two) gets copied possibly has
to do with stress‐attracting and stress‐avoiding syllables discussed earlier in
sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.6. The stems of the examples in (27) all begin with a stress‐
avoiding syllable 7. Apparently, the characteristic ‘stress avoiding’ is relevant for
the reduplicated prefix as well. A syllable that is specified with ‘avoid stress’
cannot be copied by itself. It needs a host for stress. In the examples in (28), the
first syllable is unstressed, but not because it is stress avoiding, or because the
7The case of shama in (25)b is somewhat deviant. I did find one instance where the first
syllable of shama was stressed. On the other hand, ‐shama as a suffix (deceased)
systematically avoids having a stressed first syllable.","[70, 71]"

3.3 Parts of speech
As is shown in Anward et al. (1997), languages can differ from each other in
several respects when it comes to the inventory of their lexical categories. They
can differ in what kind of categories they identify; the distinction between verbs
and nouns seems to be universal (Schachter 1985:6‐7), though even that is
questioned (cf. Hengeveld 1992:67 for Tuscarora). Adjectives, (manner) adverbs
and smaller parts of speech are not universal at all. Languages can also differ in
terms of the criteria that can be used to distinguish their lexical categories. The
general approach in any language to distinguish lexical categories is that “the
primary, definitional properties of parts of speech are semantic or pragmatic,
rather than form related; (…) semantic or pragmatic features are part‐of‐speech
defining only if there is at least one formal characteristic that correlates with
them” (Anward et al. 1997:172). Formal characteristics can be found on the
syntactic, morphological or phonological level 11. Languages differ as to which of
these formal characteristics correlates with the semantic‐pragmatic features.
  These differences, together with the fact that the boundaries between the
different parts of speech are sometimes rather fuzzy (cf. Payne 1997:32), make it a
difficult task to identify the parts of speech of a language. Therefore the
distinctions I have chosen to make, although based on notional, syntactic,
morphological, and sometimes even phonological criteria, do not reflect rigid
classes with clear‐cut boundaries, but rather they reflect tendencies associated
with certain lexical classes.
  When these precautions are taken into consideration, we might say that
Yurakaré distinguishes seven lexical classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitic particles. I will discuss each of the parts of

         drunk‐3=PL=DSC
         ‘They are drunk already.’(AR‐8MI‐61)In (66)a, =naja indicates that a new situation has arisen, namely a situation in
which the field is ready; in (66)b, the two main characters of the story are trying to
get a couple of birds drunk. It takes a long time for them to get drunk, but finally
they reach the point where a new situation arises when they are finally drunk. The
term ‘discontinuative’ is used broadly here, and is mainly chosen to contrast it
with the continuative =bëla. In the examples it is explicitly not the case that the
situation of the field being finished is discontinued, or that the situation of being
drunk is being discontinued, rather the opposite. What it does is that it indicates
the new situation that has arisen comes in the place of another, previously existing
situation.
  When =naja appears on a negated sentence, it is interpreted as ‘no longer’, ‘not
…anymore’:(67) a   tishilë   nish       achama‐ø=naja
         now       NEG        be.like.that‐3=DSC
         ‘Now it is not like that anymore.’ (AR‐8MI‐87)

         naughty‐3=PL=SS         NEG     3SG‐IO‐nice:3PL.S=NVR=DSC Tiri
         ‘When they were naughty, Tiri no longer liked them.’ (AR‐8MI‐65)In (67)a, the speaker is telling about the old garments the Yurakaré Indians used to
wear. And he says that it is not like that anymore. In (67)b, the same speaker tells
us a little later that they do not have their faith anymore, because strange (white?)
people came to visit his ancestors. In (67)c, finally, Tiri’s children grow up, and
they turn out to be very naughty, disobedient children, so Tiri does not like them
anymore.
  In the above examples =naja, at least in the positive sentences, is attached to the
predicate that expresses the event that is responsible for ending a previous state of
affairs. However, when =naja is found on questions this does not need to be the
case:

          ‘How is your child now?’ (FL‐14MA‐1)In these examples =naja indicates something like ‘in the current situation’. In (68)a,
the speaker’s husband and brothers have just been murdered, and so she says:
‘What am I to do now, in the current situation, where I am all alone?’ In (68)b, a
father asks his wife how their daughter is today. She was ill, but he asks her how
she is doing currently.
  On imperatives and the like, =naja expresses impatience in the sense that the
speaker urges the addressee(s) to stop whatever they are doing and to follow his
request:(69) a    bay‐tu=naja

          3SG‐IO‐wash‐IMP.SG=DSC
          ‘Wash it for her!’ (FL‐14MA‐2)The element =naja is actually rarely found on other elements than predicates. In
this sense it belongs in the previous section 7.1. However, since it stands in
contrast with continuative =bëla, it seems better to discuss it here. Moreover, there
is one instance where =naja is found in another place:(70) tëtë‐pshë    ka‐n‐dula‐shta‐m             tishilë=naja   almuerzo
     what‐entity 3SG‐IO‐do;make‐FUT‐2SG.S      now=DSC        lunch
     ‘What are you going to prepare him for lunch now?’ (FL‐14MA‐1)More generally, the aspectual enclitics =bë, =bëla and =naja have a stronger
tendency to be marked on the verb than the modal enclitics.","[272, 273, 274]"

1.3 Fieldwork1.3.1 Fieldwork situation and methodology
The present work is based almost entirely on fieldwork data. I collected data in
two main areas and in four different communities:                          Table 3 ‐ Fieldwork locations
   year     place           province                department       period

   2004     Loma del Masí   Marban                  Beni             1,5 monthIn 2001 I spent three months in La Misión on the border of the Chapare and
Carrasco provinces in the department of Cochabamba (cf. Map 2). Of those three
months I was able to conduct fieldwork for only two months, because of political
problems. Politically, La Misión falls under the administration of the Territorio
Indígena Coni‐Yura, a body run by indigenous inhabitants of the area, and I
needed permission from them. Since it took them rather long to answer my
request, the people of La Misión in a village meeting decided to make a
preliminary decision to help me with my research. At the end of my stay in 2001 I
still did not have an answer from the authorities. The answer finally came after a
month in La Misión in 2002, and it was negative, without any reason given.
  This meant that I had to go to another area, so I traveled to Trinidad where I met
Julio Ribera, who works with the Yurakaré Indians living in the Beni department.
He introduced me to the president and vice‐president of the subcentral (the local
indigenous administration) of the area, which comprises the uppermost part of the
Isiboro River as well as a part of the Mamoré River. This time the permission was
given swiftly and gladly, so I started working here, on the condition that I would

Introduction
work in several villages of the area and that I would deliver a dictionary. The first
condition had as a result that I worked in three villages in the area: Tacuaral,
Nueva Canaan (both in 2002) and Loma del Masí (in 2003 and 2004); the second
condition will result in the publication of a dictionary (Van Gijn & Hirtzel, in
prep).
  During these four periods of fieldwork, I collected a number of texts, most of
which are mythological tales. These are stories that have been told for generations,
and they are also shared – with some modifications – by Yurakaré Indians in
different parts of their area of dispersion (cf. Hirtzel & Van Gijn, in prep.).
Unfortunately, there seems to be a hitch in the tradition of passing on these stories
to younger generations. I have also recorded two half‐hour dialogues, simply by
leaving the minidisk recorder behind with two people, and asking them to “just
talk”, after which I went away. The rest of the data consists of elicitation, partly
original (or whatever came up from texts), partly checking the data from other
sources (mostly Day 1980, 1991).","[27, 28]"

6.2.3 Habitual
The suffix ‐jti is used to mark habitual aspect. It appears right before the person
markers of the subject. It is used frequently in narratives:
                                             193

         scratch‐3 always DEM           woman
         ‘Whenever she went to get water, she always scratched the tree.’ (AR‐8MI‐1)The sequential utterances in (33) at the beginning of a narrative serve to indicate that
there was a habitual, repetitive action of scratching by the woman. In (33)c there is no
habitual marker necessary, since the repetitive nature is indicated by means of
repetition of the verbs and the adverb chajti(ya). In the form of this adverb one can
recognize the habitual marker ‐jti. The element cha is possibly related to the cha of
achama ‘be like that’. The habitual marker is also often used in narratives to explain
how the ancestors of the Yurakaré used to do things (as e.g. in (33)a).
  The interpretation of the habitual marker can be either present or past:(34) a   ëshë duche‐jti‐ø        numma       ta‐mme            ayma
         why burn:CAU‐HAB‐3      night       1PL‐mother        fire

         ‘Our ancestors used to make their pots and plates.’ (AR‐8MI‐16)Sometimes the habitual reading is somewhat backgrounded:(35) a   nij‐ta‐jti       ati nish     ana‐pshë        na    puydara atta         samu
         NEG‐MID‐HAB DEM NEG           DEM‐entity      DEM puydara        other jaguar

                                            194
The verb phrase
In these cases the habitual aspect marker indicates an exemplary characteristic or trait
of the subject, something which sets it apart from other things. This idea of exclusivity
is compatible with the habitual reading, and forms a connection between the habitual‐
repetitive uses of ‐jti and the limitative use of ‐jti on nominal elements (cf. section
4.4.2). In (35)a, the fact that the puydaras, mythological ancestors of the jaguar, are not
like the present‐day jaguar sets them apart as a subgroup of jaguars. In (35)b, we are
dealing with the only person to have the trait of being able to throw over trees with his
voice. In (35)c, finally, ‘being beautiful’ is characteristic for the questioned entity.
  The first person plural form of the habitual is ‐tijti, where one would expect ‐jti‐tu:(36) lëjëlë‐shta‐ø=ti     winani=ya bëbë‐tijti               bëshëë
     morning‐FUT‐3=DS walk=NVR          search‐HAB:1PL.S entity
     ‘Before sunrise we go walking to look for animals.’ (AR‐8MI‐12)This is possibly an instance of morph methatesis (Haiman 1977), and has been
discussed in section 3.2.5.","[208, 209, 210]"

There are three category‐changing derivational suffixes that can be found on nouns: an
adjectivizer ‐kka, a verbalizer i‐ and an adverbializer ‐shku(ta).‐kka: ‘measure’The suffix ‐kka is added mostly to demonstrative pronouns to indicate that the size of
something is comparable to a size indicated (mostly by holding the hand on a certain
height).(98) ana‐kka‐ø
     DEM‐MEA‐3
     ‘He is this big.’ (indicating height with hand)The suffix ‐kka changes the nominal element into an adjectival one; consequently it can
receive the collective marker ‐ima or the distributive marker ‐uma:(99) a‐werta        ana‐kk‐ima
     3SG.P‐basket   DEM‐MEA‐COL
     ‘His basket was about this big.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)It is also found on proper names (100), as well as on the question word ama (101):(100) ti‐tëë                karina‐kka     ati
      1SG‐niece;nephew      Karina‐MEA     DEM

      ‘What size would you like me to make our field?’ (AR‐8MI‐41)The suffix ‐kka in the sense of size is often found in combination with the amplification
marker ‐lë. When this suffix is attached, the marker ‐kka loses its gemination and is
                                            124
The noun phrase
rendered ‐ja after a vowel (because of the lenition of [k], see section 2.3.2 above). The
interpretation of this combination is small size:(102) kumë‐nñu ana‐ja‐lë               ajtilya‐nñu       ti‐ja‐mal‐cha‐m
      tree‐DIM     DEM‐MEA‐AMP         splinter‐DIM      1SG‐3SG‐go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S
      ‘Bring me a small tree, only this size, a splinter!’ (OR‐20MA‐2)Even though the marker seems to attach mostly to nominal elements, it can also appear
on the verb abibë ‘to be enough’:(103) abibë‐kka‐ø‐naja          ta‐jukkulë
      be.enough‐MEA‐3‐DSC       1PL‐field
      ‘Our field is big enough now.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)As mentioned in section 4.3 above, in combination with the locative marker =y and the
ablative marker =jsha, this suffix can also indicate a certain stretch of time:(104) a   nentaya    ati‐kka=y          ka‐toro‐ø      ati
          maybe      DEM‐MEA=LOC        3SG‐end‐3      DEM

root it attaches to. This is probably for semantic reasons: to indicate the size of
something presupposes a root that has some size, while in the temporal sense, it only
presupposes a state or event that is (or can be) durative, even though some speakers
have difficulties interpreting the following words 25:
25These examples are taken from a traditional song, which not many people know anymore.
Consultants said that the language of traditional songs is somewhat different from everyday
speech. Possibly, the examples in (105) are not very good representatives of what is and what is
not possible in the language.","[138, 139, 140]"

Class I clitics can be found in the domains of pronouns, conjunctions and adverbs.
Examples are the reduced forms of the demonstratives ana, ati and naa: an, a(t),

         ‘His arrow did not catch fire, subsequently.’ (AY‐2NC‐5)In these examples the clitic na is not used adjectivally, but rather independently,
except for the second occurrence of na in (49)b. In (49)b and c the corresponding
noun phrase follows later, in (49)a, there is no corresponding noun phrase. Note
too, that the clitic form of the demonstrative cannot be marked for plural, as can
be observed in (49)a and c. Furthermore, in (49)c, the clitic seems to attach to the
preceding word instead of the following word. In this specific example, na is
followed by a small pause. These facts make it hard to classify these clitics as
proclitics or enclitics. The clitics an and a(t) are more restricted. They usually only

  Another group of reduced, unstressed clitics are reduced forms of the adverb
latijsha ‘then, after that, when’, which functions as a connector. The forms are lash
and la.(50) a   la=bobo‐ø=w=ja         ka‐deche‐che‐ø=w        kummë

         ‘Then they went looking.’ (FA‐6MA‐7)These proclitics do not interfere with the word‐stress of their host either. They are
themselves unstressed. They seem to be restricted to clause initial position, but the
full form latijsha (which is sometimes also reduced to lashsha, a reduced form that
still carries stress) also mainly occurs in clause‐initial position.
  Some other adverbs also have reduced forms, such as achu ‘like that’ (ash) and
anu ‘like this’ (an), ushta ‘before’ (ush). Examples of ash= are given in (51):(51) a   ash=ta‐ø=ya            latiji (…)

A grammar of Yurakaré
As can be seen in the examples, it does not matter whether these reduced
pronouns precede ((52)b and d) or follow ((52)a and c) the predicate or noun they
are cross‐referenced with.
  In the examples of the remainder of the grammar, I will not indicate the
proclitics discussed in examples (48)‐(52) by means of the symbol ‘=’. I will in fact
not distinguish these enclitics from separate words in their representation, since
they do not seem to constitute one word with their host as much as the other
clitics do, as we will see. First, they do not form a phonological word with their
host as far as prosody is concerned; second, they seem to be more free positionally
than class II and class III clitics. Class I enclitics differ furthermore from class II
and III clitics in Yurakaré in that whereas the former generally have unreduced
and independent counterparts, the latter two do not.
  Before discussing class II clitics, I will first discuss class III clitics. Class III clitics
can be termed phrasal enclitics because they attach to a phrase‐final element. In
the nominal domain, the plural marker and the postpositional markers are
examples of phrasal enclitics:(53) a    matata ti‐pojore=w          vs.   ti‐pojore      matata=w
          big      1SG‐canoe=PL             1SG‐canoe      big=PL
          ‘my big canoes’                   ‘my big canoes’
      b   inele      elle=y           vs.   elle     inele=y
          inside     earth=LOC              earth inside=LOC
          ‘in the ground’                   ‘in the ground’The order of adjectives and nouns can be reversed, as can be seen in (53).
Nevertheless, the plural marker in (53)a as well as the postposition in (53)b remain
where they are: they attach to the rightmost element of the NP. Other nominal
enclitics are =chi ‘directional’, =jsha ‘ablative’, =la ‘instrumental’, =tina ‘comitative’
and =ja ‘subject emphasis marker’. I will discuss all of these in sections 4.2 and 4.3
below.
  NPs can be discontinuous in Yurakaré (cf. section 4.1). The head of the NP in
these circumstances is postverbal, while its modifier is in preverbal, focus position.
In these cases, the postpositions are still attached to the (rightmost) head noun,
while the preposed modifier does not have any postpositional marking:(54) a    danda‐shti        kummë matata=la
          go.up‐FUT.1SG.S tree        big=INS
          ‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
      b   matata danda‐shti             kummë=la
          big       go.up‐FUT.1SG.S     tree=INS
          ‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
                                              66
Morphology
Plural markers behave a little differently. When a plural NP is discontinuous,
usually both the modifier and the head noun are marked for plural:(55) lëshie=w ma‐bëjti         shunñe=w
     two=PL 3PL‐see:1SG.S man=PL
     ‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]Plural markers are generally found more often on both the head noun and the
modifier, even if the NP is not discontinuous, and especially with the order noun‐
adjective. Postpositional enclitics are never found on both elements.
  There are also a few clausal clitics that mostly attach to the clause‐final element.
These are modal and aspectual particles. Examples are =la ‘validational’, =bë
‘momentaneous’, =se ‘repetition (among other meanings)’ and =bëla (continuative).
They normally attach to the rightmost element of the clause, and are associated
semantically with the propositional level (cf. chapter 1):(56) a   yokkoshe      tiya‐m       mem=la
         true          eat‐2SG.S mother=VAL
         ‘You really did eat it, mother.’ (AR‐8MI‐25)

         NEG     see‐3=PL=NVR       DEM     brother=PL=CNT
         ‘His brothers still had not seen him yet.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)In (56)a the enclitic =la is attached to the noun denoting the addressee, in (56)b =bë
is attached to the object of the verb, and in (56)c, the enclitic =se attaches to the
subject. The enclitic =bëla in (56)d, finally, is attached to the subject. These enclitics
can also attach to other parts of speech:(57) a   tiya‐y=la
         eat‐1SG.S=VAL
         ‘I did eat it!’ (AR‐8MI‐25)

                                           67
A grammar of Yurakaré
In (57)a, =la attaches to a predicate, as does =se in (57)c. In (57)b, =bë attaches to an
adverb. In other words: these syntactic enclitics can attach to different hosts when
they are the last element of the clause. Occasionally, an element that pertains to
the clause comes after the clausal enclitic:(58) a     mala‐ø=la       noe     li‐ja‐nama‐ø=t=chi
           go.SG‐3=VAL     Noah DEL‐3SG‐dry‐3=DS=DIR
           ‘Noe went to where it was dry.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)
     b     kani      sewe‐ø=ya=bë         tiri
           not.yet born‐3=NVR=MOM Tiri
           ‘Tiri had not been born yet.’ (AR‐8MI‐9)In (58)a and b, the enclitics =la and =bë are followed by the subject‐NP of the clause
they belong to. This is especially clear with the enclitic =bëla ‘continuative’ in the
following example:(59) nij   bëjta‐ø=w=ya na      pi=w=bëla         samu          na   ma‐mme‐shama
     NEG see‐3=PL=NVR DEM brother=PL=CNT jaguar:PL DEM 3PL‐mother‐PST
     che‐jbëshë=w
     eat‐entity=PL
     ‘The brothers had not seen him yet, the ones that ate his late mother.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)  A special group of syntactic clausal enclitics are two types of clitics that change
according to the gender of the speaker: =ri/=ra for men and =yu/=ye for women:(60) a     lat   mapakka‐ø ati‐kka‐jtë‐ø           latiji=la=yu
           SEQ big‐3            DEM‐MEA‐SPC‐3      subsequently=VAL=EXPR.F
           ‘Then he was big. He must have been about that size. (FA‐6MA‐6)

           ‘Her body is tickly.’ (DV‐14MA‐1)
     c     am=chi mala‐jtë          latiji=ri
           WH=DIR go.SG‐SPC‐3 subsequently=EXPR.M
           ‘Where did he go to?’(AR‐8MI‐59)
     d     media     ora‐nñu      kusu‐ø=naja    pëpë=ra
           half      hour‐DIM want‐3=DSC         grandfather=NB.M
           ‘Half an hour, the old one wanted.’ (FL‐14MA‐1)As mentioned above, clitics cannot be morphologically followed by affixes. They
can, however, be followed by a lexical element in a compound. In (61), the stem
mujumuju carries the locative postposition =y, which in turn is followed by the
compounded noun bëshë ‘thing, entity’.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"

3.3.3 Verbs
Verbs are prototypically actions: agentive actions involving concrete participants,
having a relatively short duration, and spatially more diffuse than nouns (Givón
2001‐I:52).
  The typical function of a verb is the predicative function (Croft 2003:184‐185,
Schachter 1985:9). This is not a distinguishing feature of verbs in Yurakaré,
however. Nouns and adjectives can also function as (stative) predicates without
any overt formal marking that indicates a change in lexical category.(86) a   së=ja              ulë‐y
         1SG.PRN=EMPH guayabochi.tree‐1SG.S
         ‘I was that, I was the guayabochi tree.’ (AR‐8MI‐7)
     b   Arsenio=ja         poropesor‐shta‐ø=la
         Arsenio=EMPH teacher‐FUT‐3=VAL
         Arsenio will be a teacher.’ [AT‐3MI‐121]Example (86)a is taken from a mythological text in which a Guayabochi tree
changes into a person. Now this person is telling a woman that he was the
Guayabochi tree. The subject sëja is marked with the emphasis marker =ja, which
appears almost exclusively on subjects. Furthermore, the predicate ulëy takes the
subject cross‐reference marker ‐y for first person singular. The word that functions
as a predicate has the notional characteristics of a noun, referring to a concrete,
                                            79
A grammar of Yurakaré
even specific item. In (86)b the predicate nominal is marked for future tense, a
category normally associated with verbs.
  Some predicate nominals can even take applicative prefixes. In the following
examples the affected object applicative (cf. 5.2.4) triggers the interpretation of
detachment in (87)a; in (87)b, the attachment‐reading is caused by the indirect
object applicative (cf. 5.2.3):(87) a   më=ja              ka‐la‐uli‐m               pa=ja             ka‐la‐uli‐p
         2SG.PRN=EMPH 3SG‐AFO‐penis‐2SG.S             2PL.PRN=EMPH 3SG‐AFO‐penis‐2PL.S
         ‘You (sg) cut off his penis; you (pl) cut off his penis.’(OR‐19MA‐2)
     b   li‐ma‐n‐shansha‐shta‐ø        latiji
         DEL‐3PL‐IO‐tooth‐FUT‐3        subsequently
         ‘He provided them with teeth.’ (AR‐8MI‐35)In (87)a, the predicate function is performed by a noun, which also refers to a
concrete and specific object. Like in (86)a, this predicate takes subject cross‐
reference marking (for second person singular and plural) and the overtly
expressed subject argument is marked with the emphasis marker =ja. However, in
(87)a we can also see that the object word can take valency increasing morphology
(the prefix la‐ for affected object ‐ cf. section 5.2.4) and consequently an object
complement, referring to the person who got his penis cut off. In (87)b, the
predicate nominal, not specific this time, takes another kind of applicative and is
modified by an adverb. Furthermore it takes the future tense marker ‐shta.
  Adjectives can be used as predicates as easily as object‐words (nouns):(88) a   maj~matata‐ø=ya latiji               a‐jukkulë
         INTS~big‐3=NVR      subsequently 3SG.P‐field
         ‘His field was then really big.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)
     b   yita‐p=naja
         good‐2PL.S=DSC
         ‘You are alright now.’ (AR‐8MI‐37)
     c   tëtë‐pshë=ja (…)      mij~mi‐n‐shuyulë‐jti‐ø        meme
         what‐entity=EMPH      INTS~2SG‐IO‐beautiful‐HAB‐3   mother
         ‘What do you find really beautiful, mother?’ (AR‐8MI‐50)In (88)a the property word functions as a predicate (cf. the non‐veridical enclitic
=ya, which only attaches to predicates. In (88)b, the property word yita takes the
subject marker ‐p for second person plural, and in (88)c, shuyulë takes the
applicative marker n‐ as well as the habitual marker ‐jti.
  Verbs, in short, cannot be distinguished from adjectives and nouns on the basis
of their function as predicates. However, verbs cannot be arguments of predicates
without any overt marking. They can be arguments of verbs either when they

different subject marker =ti (cf. chapter 8.2.4):(89) a     na=yj        ma‐ssë‐ø=w        na      wiwi‐pshë=w

           ‘I finished harvesting rice (my harvesting rice is finished for me)’ [MH‐24MA‐4]There is no clear answer to the question whether the ti‐marked clause indicates a
‘when’‐clause rather than a real argument, i.e.: ‘When I had harvested my rice I
was finished.’ However, ti‐marked clauses can take postpositions, which are
normally associated with noun phrases:(90) mashi‐ø=ti=jsha       ajuyja‐shta‐tu
     rain‐3=DS=ABL         fish‐FUT‐1PL.S
     ‘Even if it rains we’ll go fishing.’ [MV‐24MA‐22]There are also constructions such as the following:(91) nij  poyde winani‐tu     puwa‐tu=ja
     NEG can      walk‐1PL.S drunk‐1PL.S=SS
     ‘We could not walk when we were drunk.’ [FA‐28MA‐1]The sequence poyde winanitu seems to be a case where a verb (winanitu), without
any further measures being taken is used as an argument of the verb (Hengeveld’s
1992 criterion). However, on closer scrutiny, there seem to be measures that have
been taken after all. The matrix verb poyde does not carry any subject marking, and
is conjoined to the adjacent VP. In fact, as I will be discussing in chapter 8.2.1, this
is one way of marking subordination. The matrix verb can also be fully inflected,
but then the complement verb has to be marked by means of the enclitic =ti.(92) nij     poydi=la           ma‐alkansa=ni=ti
     NEG     can:1SG.S=VAL      3PL‐reach‐INTL:1SG.S=DS
     ‘I couldnʹt reach them.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)Action‐words can modify a noun only if they are marked as a relative clause by
means of the different subject marker =ti, the same subject marker =ja, or by means
of a compound with bëshë (reduced to pshë) ‘entity’. In (93)c we again see that
nouns can be in adjectival function as long as their meaning allows for it:

         ‘Go out.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)The ignorative marker on commands is not obligatory, but it is mainly used when
the speaker is curious to find out something as a result of the execution of the
command. In (11)a, the speaker orders someone else to take a look in the attic,
because some liquid is dripping from above, and he wants to know what it is. In
(11)b the command is to hit birds from a tree with a pole, to verify if the requestee
is capable of doing such a thing. In (11)c, finally, from the story of Noah, Noah
sends out his pigeon to see whether the trees have come out above the water yet.
In (12) below, the underlying question, or lack of knowledge is overtly expressed
and, not surprisingly, also marked with =chi:(12) li‐ma‐ujwa‐ni‐m=chi              tëtë‐pshë     yaju=chi
     DEL‐3PL‐look‐INTL‐2SG.S=IGN      what‐entity talk:3PL=IGN
     ‘Go and see what they are talking about.’ (AR‐8MI‐68)The same explanation as for the imperatives holds for the combination of the
intentional marker ‐ni with the ignorative =chi:(13) yutchi       së=ja               danda‐ni=chi
     let’s.see    1SG.PRN=EMPH go.up‐INT=IGN
     ‘Well let’s see, I will go up then.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)This is from the same story as example (11)a above. After the speaker has sent all
of his brothers up to go and see what is upstairs (they all say there is nothing up
there) he decides to go and have a look himself, with the underlying lack of
knowledge.
  The ignorative marker is also often used for incompletive aspect or frustrative:(14) müta‐ø=w=ja che‐shta‐ø=w=chi
     pull.out‐3=PL eat‐FUT‐3=PL=IGN
     ‘They pulled him out and were going to eat them.’ (AR‐8MI‐33)The ignorative marker in combination with the future marker ‐shta indicates that
something unexpected happened that prevented the event marked with =chi from                                           238
Propositional markers
actually taking place. In this story, a bunch of Puydaras (jaguar‐like creatures)
want to eat a human being. However, his body turns out to be so tough that the
Puydaras break their teeth and are unable to eat him. The function of =chi here
may be that we cannot be sure whether, under normal circumstances they really
would have eaten him.
  In general, when an action is not carried out completely, the unfinished or
unsuccessful action is marked with =chi. In this sense it has a frustrative function:
the event as expected does not take place. This can be seen in the following
examples:(15) a    at=chi       ma‐mali=chi           lëshie jente=w     ti‐shuju           ana

          then       DEL‐3PL‐IO‐let.go‐1SG.S   come‐1SG.S 1SG‐hit;kill‐FUT‐3=PL=IGN
          ‘Then I let them go and came [here]; they were going to kill me.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)The examples here are from a text in which the speaker tried to kidnap two
people, but was prevented from doing so, because they tried to pierce his neck,
trying to kill him. In this latter event, the people were frustrated because the
kidnapper fled.

he has the word’.‐jta ‘smell’The suffix ‐jta on a noun means that it smells like what is expressed in the noun:(109) a   dyarru‐jta‐m

ku‐ which denotes cooperative object third person (cf. section 5.2.2). The verb ta ‘say’,
which is probably the source for the middle marker ‐tA, takes the cooperative object

Apart from the subclassification of nouns proper on the basis of number and collective
marking (cf. section 4.2), the class of nouns can be further subdivided into a number of
subclasses. First, we can distinguish pronouns. There are three types of pronouns:
demonstrative, personal and the question word ama.","[140, 141, 142, 143]"

3.3.6 Interjections
There is a small class of interjections, a group of words which are also
phonologically deviant, often consisting of one syllable and ending in consonants
that are normally disallowed. Interjections take no morphology, and appear
sentence initially (optionally preceded by an adverbial element that has scope over
the entire clause). They express the attitude of the speaker. A sample of these
particles is given in Table 18:                               Table 18 ‐ Interjections
           item                 attitude                  gloss

nominals: ‘proper’ predicate nominals, i.e. clauses indicating proper inclusion or
attribution – Stassen’s categories (ii) and (iii) – predicate locatives, existentials and
predicative possession. He sets up the following continuum for predicate
nominals, based on the likelihood of the constructions having a semantically rich
verb (p.113):       Table 46 - semantically rich verbs and predicate nominals (Payne 1997:113)

We have already seen that the leftmost category does not have a semantically rich
verb, and that predicate locative clauses usually do have a semantically rich verb,
although constructions without such a verb marginally occur.
  Purely existential constructions normally have a location verb:(11) a    tütü‐ø=ya       shinama ati        aysa
          sit;be‐3=NVR before       DEM      Aysa

introduced. Example (11)b comes from a dialogue in which one of the
interlocutors starts talking about beehives that he has seen. This is a surprise to the
other interlocutor so she verifies whether there indeed are any.
  There are occasions where an existential sentence occurs without a semantically
rich verb:

(12) lëtta  tejte‐ø=la

         ‘The agouti once had a tail, he was like a squirrel.’ (AR‐8MI‐44)Another possessive construction, used for temporal possession, is with the verb

     what‐entity 3SG‐sit;be‐2SG.S=IGN
     ‘What do you have with you?’ (AR‐8MI‐23)Locomotion clauses always have a semantically rich verb. Whereas location verbs
differ from each other in manner, distinctions between locomotion verbs usually
concern the path of motion, e.g. otto ‘go out’ vs. yupa ‘go in’; danda ‘go up’ vs.
shopto ‘go down’.

Only the predicate nominals have a zero copula (i.e. the nouns and adjectives are

The fact that there are not many adverbs in Yurakaré is presumably because there
are alternative strategies for some of the adverb classes. For instance, the very low
number of manner adverbs can be explained by the fact that the function of
manner adverbs is often fulfilled by ideophones (cf. section 3.3.5). Other lexical
categories can be changed into manner adverbs with suffixes ‐shkuta or ‐sh. Place
adverbials can be formed from nouns with the help of the local postpositions (cf.
section 3.3.7). Number, intensity, aspect and mood can be marked
morphologically. Time adverbs are the only category that does not have any
alternative strategies, except for the future marker ‐shta.
  Adverbs are generally positioned according to their relation to the predicate: the
tighter the relation, the closer the adverb is to the predicate:

          3PL‐arrow too
          ‘Then the ancestors made their arrows as well.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)In (94)a, lacha marks the fact that the ability to heal comes in addition to other
characteristics of the mororumas (mysterious angel‐like creatures). In (94)b, the
contrast is between other persons going along the creek and the ancestors going
along the creek as well: the ancestors are included within the scope of the adverb
lacha. In (94)c we see basically the same situation as in (94)b, only now the object
precedes the adverb. The difference between (94)b and c seems to be, that in the
former the subject argument is given extra emphasis, much as in English ‘the
ancestors too went along the creek’ versus ‘the ancestors went along the creek too’.
  Adverbs of sequentiality, place and discourse structure are usually found at the
edges of the clause, whereas adverbs of manner, intensity, and phasality are found
in positions closer to the predicate. I will discuss adverbs in section 6.5
3.3.5 Ideophones
Ideophones are widespread in Yurakaré, and even though some ideophones may
be made up on the spot, there is a set of shared and lexicalized ideophones.
Ideophones can be defined as follows:         a vivid representation of an idea in sound. A word, often
         onomatopoeic, which describes a predicate, qualificative or
         adverb in respect to manner, color, sound, smell, action, state or
         intensity (Doke 1935:119).","[97, 98, 99]"

4.4.2 Non‐category‐changing derivation
‐nñu ‘diminutive’The suffix ‐nñu is used to express small size or refinement. It is a cross‐categorical
suffix found on nouns, verbs and adjectives. On nouns it usually only indicates small
size (86), on proper names it can also mean affection (87).(86) a     ëshshë‐nñu ka‐tütü‐ø          matata ëshshë a‐dojo=y
           stone‐DIM       3SG‐sit;be‐3 big         stone 3SG.P‐body=LOC
           ‘The little stone is on top of the big stone.’ [FR‐PC]
      b    soboto=y li‐tütü‐ø          sewe‐nñu
           belly=LOC DEL‐sit;be‐3 child‐DIM
           ‘The small child was inside the belly.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)(87) nij   ama‐kka=y        bali‐tu         biriki‐nñu
      NEG WH‐MEA=LOC go.PL‐1PL.S            Brigida‐DIM
      ‘We did not go far, did we, little Brigida? (AA‐27MA‐10)‐tebe: ‘meant for’The suffix ‐tebe on a noun denotes a supportive relation. The derived noun refers to a
utensil that can be used with respect to the entity expressed by the root noun.(88) a     ti‐bana‐tebe
           1SG‐arm‐FOR
           ‘my bracelet’ [FL‐5MA‐7]
      b    arush‐tebe
           rice‐FOR
           ‘a barrow’ [FL‐5MA‐7]What exactly the purposive or usefulness relation entails is different from situation to
situation. In (88)a, the derived noun serves to put around the root noun, in (88)b, it
serves to load or carry the root noun. But there are also instances such as the question‐
answer pair in (89), where it denotes a role the derived noun could play:
                                             120
The noun phrase
(89) a     mi‐n‐tëpshë‐tebe       mi‐jusu‐ø=chi     shunñe
           2SG‐IO‐what‐FOR        2SG‐want‐3=IGN    man
           ‘What do you want a man for?’ (AR‐8MI‐6)
      b    ti‐jusu‐ø      ti‐ba‐tebe‐ni 21
           1SG‐want‐3 1SG‐husband‐FOR‐INTL
           ‘I would like for him to be my husband.’ (AR‐8MI‐6)Tebe also occurs as an independent, usually possessed root:(90) pëpësu a‐tebe‐ni
     pëpësu 3SG.P‐utensil‐INTL
     ‘[the ax] was meant for Pëpësu (to hit him)’ (OR‐19MA‐11)As an independent noun it has essentially the same function as in suffix form: it marks
an object as purposive, supportive for another object.‐j: ‘material’A marginally used suffix is ‐j, found on nouns; it denotes the material out of which
something is made:(91) a     pilili‐j        lewle
           stone‐MAT       plate
           ‘a stone plate’   [MV‐32MA‐8]
      b    elesha‐j          bajsu
           aluminum‐MAT cup
           ‘an aluminum cup’ [MV‐32MA‐8]It is also used in a slightly different way in the following construction:(92) lëyshu‐j        (…) bali‐ø‐w
     squirrel‐MAT    (…) go.PL‐3‐PL
     ‘They changed into squirrels.’ (FA‐6MA‐8)‐jti: ‘limitative’The suffix ‐jti on a noun indicates that the proposition applies only or purely to the
marked noun. It is translatable with the English ‘only’, ‘just’ or ‘purely’:
21Note that the modal marker ‐ni ‘intentional (cf. section 6.3.1) can be used with nouns, even if
they are not in predicative function. On nouns, it marks an intended function.","[134, 135, 136]"

collective, and intensity/degree marking. Finally, adverbs mostly derive from
adjectives in a different manner than from verbs and especially nouns.
  Most, but not all property words can take the distributive marker ‐uma. It is at
this point not entirely clear what this difference is based upon. In general,
adjectives referring to age cannot take this marker, and adjectives referring to
dimension most often take the distributive marker. Verbs can also take the
distributive marker, but only in combination with the prefix i‐. Together with
‐uma, this prefix denotes verbal plural. Nouns do not take ‐uma.
  The collective marker ‐ima is only found on adjectives and it indicates that the
property in question should be considered as relating to a collection of entities:(80) ñuñuj‐ima=w ti‐palanta=w
     small‐COL=PL 1SG‐banana=PL
     ‘my small bunch of bananas’ [FP‐2MA‐15]However, when animate beings are modified, the adjective cannot carry the
collective suffix, except for the word atta ‘other’:(81) achu‐ta         dula‐tijti           shinama pa=tina            att‐ima
     like.that‐MID do;make‐HAB:1PL.S before           2PL.PRN=COM other‐COL
     jente=w=tina
     person=PL=COM
     ‘Like that we did with you before, and with other peoples.’ (AR‐8MI‐87)The intensifying prefix (reduplicative), exemplified in (82) as well as the limited
degree marker ‐mashi, cf. (83), are shared by adjectives, verbs and adverbs (though
‐mashi on adverbs is rendered ‐mash).(82) a   ñuj~ñuñujulë
         INTS~small
         ‘very small’(AR‐8MI‐41)

     c   latijsha pënchi‐mash …
         then       later‐LD
         ‘Then a little later…’ (AR‐8MI‐35)Finally, manner adverbs can be derived from adjectives by means of the suffix ‐sh,
whereas adverbs derived from verbs and especially nouns are mostly marked
with the suffix ‐shku:(84) a   santa=w         ënnëtë‐sh    ma‐m‐bë‐ø=w=ti
         widow=PL        bad‐ADV      3PL‐IO‐treat‐3=PL=DS
         ‘if they treat the widows badly…’      (AR‐8MI‐55)
     b   sebe‐shku‐ta              suwita‐ø=ti
         peanut‐ADV.CMP‐MID grow‐3=DS
         ‘if it grows like a peanut…’ (AR‐8MI‐67)However, this is not a difference that necessarily correlates with the difference
between adjectives and other word classes, since both verbs and nouns are
occasionally found with the marker ‐sh. The difference between ‐sh and ‐shku
rather seems to be that the former derives a manner adverb of the type ‘in a X
way’, whereas the latter derives a comparative adverb of the type ‘like X is/does’.
  Quantifying modifiers (quantifiers and numerals) can be regarded as a subclass
of adjectives, since they share most of the characteristics of adjectives, i.e. they take
diminutive, distributive, collective, intensity and degree markers as well:

1.    IntroductionThe Yurakaré Indians form a small indigenous group that lives in the foothill area
of central Bolivia. Their language, Yurakaré, is one of the many languages in an
area that is a complicated puzzle of seemingly unrelated languages. The objective
of this book is to give a grammatical description of the Yurakaré language.
  The study of South‐American languages has seen a big increase in research
efforts at the beginning of the millenium. Looking at the situation in the Yurakaré
area alone, a number of complete grammars have appeared in the years preceding
the appearance of this grammar: Latundê/Lakondê (Telles 2002), Moré (Angenot
2002), Sabanê (Antunes 2004), Kanoê (Bacelar 2004), Kwaza (Van der Voort 2004),
Cavineña (Guillaume 2004), Mosetén (Sakel 2004) and Yuki (Villafañe 2004). Apart
from these a number of grammatical descriptions are in preparation: Sararé
(Borella in prep.), Araona (Emkow in prep.), Movima (Haude in prep.), Baure
(Danielsen in prep.), Itonama (Crevels in prep.), Arikapu (Van der Voort in prep.),
Leko (Van de Kerke in prep.), Maropa (Guillaume in prep.), and Uru (Hanss in
prep.). Finally, two important language surveys of major areas in South America
have appeared: Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999) on Amazonian languages, and
Adelaar with Muysken (2004) on Andean languages.
  It is in this growing tradition of study of the languages of South America that
this grammar appears. It is the ideal situation in the sense that it can maximally
profit from and contribute to the growing body of material.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
(135) a   bëm‐ima            palanta=w
          much;many‐COL banana=PL
          ‘many bunches of bananas’
     b    ñunti‐nñu‐ø        ti‐awaryente
          little;few‐DIM‐3 1SG‐alcohol
          ‘I have only a tiny bit of alcohol.’
     c    ñunti‐lë‐ø         ti‐awaryente
          little;few‐AMP‐3 1SG‐alcohol
          ‘I have only a tiny bit of alcohol.’
     d    bëj~bëmë‐ø             ti‐awaryente
          INTS~much;many‐3 1SG‐alcohol
          ‘I have MUCH alcohol.’There is also a quantifier mumuy/mumay which means ‘all’. This quantifier behaves as a
noun, and it is obligatorily possessed:(136) a   a‐mumuy
          3SG.P‐all
          ‘all of it.’
     b    ta‐mmuy
          1PL‐all
          ‘all of us’
     c    pa‐mmuy
          2PL‐all
          ‘all of you’
     d    ma‐mmuy
          3PL‐all
          ‘all of them’When prefixed by the heavy plural possessive prefixes (cf. section 2.4.2), the stress
shifts to those prefixes and the first vowel of mumuy is elided. Another element that
functions in this way is machijsha ‘self’, which is also obligatorily possessed:(137) a   ti‐manchijsha
          1SG‐self
          ‘myself’
     b    a‐manchijsha
          3SG.P‐self
          ‘himself’
                                             138
The noun phrase
The same elements (i.e. llipi ‘all; each’ and kiki ‘self’) are mentioned by Muysken
(1994:191) for Quechua as quantifiers that are obligatorily inflected. 28
  Yurakaré has four indigenous numerals: lëtta ‘one’, lëshie ‘two’, liwi ‘three’ and lëpsha
‘four’. The rest of the numerals are borrowed from Spanish. These four numerals have
always stood apart in the more elaborate numbering system. LaCueva (1893:7) gives
the following list of numerals: 29      Los numerales son: 1 lecta; 2 lasie; 3 livi; 4 lapsa; 5 cheti; 6 chicheti; 7 livi tese;
      8 lasie tese; 9 lecta tese; 10 tibanti; 11 lecta‐n‐dojo; 20 lasie tibanti, lasie‐juta
      tibanti, lasie sata; 100 tibanti sata, ca‐sata, tibanti‐ve. Regularmente señalan la
      cuenta con los dedos. 30Apart from the numerals 1‐4, one could also say that cheti is also a basic numeral, and it
seems that this was the last numeral to have been lost, judging from the data in Day
(1991). She indicates that numerals six and upward are only encountered in the more
remote national park Isiboro‐Sécure, while cheti is still found in her fieldwork sites.
Day (1991) also shows some differences with LaCueva in the higher numerals:(138) numerals 6 and further (Day 1991)

numerals, at least from 7 upward, were not grammaticalized. The element ti is an
enclitic or suffix, nowadays found on the Spanish numerals, meaning something like
‘quantity’ (e.g. also on the question word am‐ti ‘how much, many’). Tibanti can be
interpreted ti‐banna‐ti, ‘the quantity of my hand(s)’. Tësë is a verb meaning ‘to stand’. If
we then look at the numerals of La Cueva, we might expect that counting was done by
leaving out fingers and then indicating how many fingers of the second hand were left
standing: with seven there are three fingers left standing, with eight there are two and
with nine only one. Eleven (lecta‐n‐dojo) can also be explained more or less: idojo means
to surpass, ti‐n‐dojo means to pass me by, lëtta‐n‐dojo then could have meant ‘to pass
one by, or surpass with one’. The meaning of lasie tibanti for twenty is clear, lassie‐juta
28 Muysken (1994:191) also mentions sapa ‘alone’. In Yurakaré, dala ‘alone’ also has deviant
behavior in that it takes indirect objects.
29 In La Cueva’s orthography, c refers to /k/, b and v both refer to /b/ and no distinction is madebetween /s/ and /S/ or between /a/ and /Q/.
30 They regularly signal the counting with their fingers [my translation].","[152, 153, 154]"

Introduction
above). There was no question of real, lasting contact between the Yurakaré and
the Spaniards at that point, however.
  This situation changes somewhat in the eighteenth century, when some of the
Yurakaré Indians come into contact with Jesuit missionaries working in the Moxos
area. This was the case especially in the last part of the eighteenth century, when
the Jesuit mission constructed a route to make a connection between Cochabamba
and the missions in what today is the Beni department. There is little written
information about how numerous and intense these contacts between the Jesuit
missionaries and the Yurakaré were. The Jesuits do not seem to have been
particularly interested in the conversion of the Yurakaré, and conversion attempts
affected at most part of the Yurakaré community (cf. Kelm 1966:91‐102).
  After the expulsion of the Jesuits from the area, the Franciscan mission, directed
from the convent in Tarata, near Cochabamba, was more serious and active in
reducing the Yurakaré Indians and ending their nomadic lifestyle of gathering and
hunting. From the end of the eighteenth century, Franciscan priests came from the
monastery of Tarata to the Chapare and Carrasco provinces. In 1793, P.Fr. Marcos
Meléndez founded the mission Asunción de Yuracarés (Montaño Aragón
1989:413). After this a whole series of Franciscan priests founded several missions,
not all equally successful from a Franciscan point of view. Because of
mismanagement and subsequent abandonment of the missions by the Yurakarés,
the conversion attempts of the Franciscans ultimately did not amount to much (cf.
Von Holten 1877, who held the missionary Izquierdo personally responsible for
the abandonment of the missions in 1872). Finally, during the wars of
independence, the Franciscans had to depart from the area, leaving the Yurakarés
living an independent life. By the time Alcide d’Orbigny passed the area in the
1830s, the Yurakaré lived in complete independence. D’Orbigny found the
fieldnotes of Franciscan priest La Cueva, who worked with the Yurakaré at the
beginning of the nineteenth century. These fieldnotes contained invaluable
information about the Yurakaré language, and they were published in 1893 by
French publisher Lucien Adam (cf. section 1.2.1).
  After the Jesuits and the Franciscans, there was an increase of commercial
activities in the area. More and more Andean colonizers settled in the area to find
a better future. This economic activity received a boost in the 1970s and 1980s,
when profits of the narcotics industry were sky rocketing. For the Yurakarés, this
meant an invasion of their territory, and displacement for some of them.
  The 1950s saw the arrival of the New Tribes Mission, an Evangelist mission from
the United States. They have been very influential in certain regions, but they did
not manage to convert all Yurakarés, even though the New Tribes missionaries
have traveled through the whole Yurakaré area. As far as religion goes, there is
not very much left of their old convictions, but Christian belief has only partially
taken root in the Yurakaré communities. In some of the communities of the
Chapare/Carrasco province, the conversion attempts of the New Tribes Mission
have created a rather faithful group of Evangelist Yurakarés, but the influence of                                         5

this group does not extend very much further, In the Beni department, the
Yurakaré mostly consider themselves Catholic. There is no active profession of the
Catholic faith in the sense that there is a weekly service. Catholic festivities are
usually celebrated and most children are baptized.
  Currently the Yurakaré Indians are mainly agrarians living of the crops they
cultivate. There is some minor commercial activity (selling crops, hides of
caimans, turtle eggs etc.). The traditional territory of the Yurakarés is becoming
more and more inhabited by other ethnic groups. In the Chapare/Carrasco
provinces of Cochabamba, the Yurakaré Indians mainly interact with Quechua
Indians, who live among them. In the TIPNIS the area is shared with Quechuas,
Aymaras, and mainly Chimanes (Hirtzel 2000). In the Beni department, finally,
there is frequent contact and intermarriage with Trinitario Indians (Arawak).","[19, 20, 21]"

7.3.3 Combinations of expressive enclitics
Here, not all logical possibilities are present in my data either, but I can
supplement my data with the information in Day (1980). Nevertheless, the same
cautionary remark should be made as in the previous section, namely that most
combinations are not very common, and statements about their meaning should
be taken as preliminary and ad hoc.=la ‘validational’ + =ri/yu ‘expressive’(76) a    ati‐kka‐jtë        latiji=la=yu
          DEM‐MEA‐SPC        subsequently=VAL=EXPR.F
          ‘He will have been about this size.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
      b   l‐ati‐jti=ja=la=yu
          REF‐DEM‐LIM=EMPH=VAL=EXPR.F
          ‘But that is the only one there is!’ (DV‐14MA‐2)These are actually the only instances that I have found of this combination. In
(76)a, the interpretation seems to be that the speaker is giving an estimate (a
combination of =jtë and =yu), but she is convinced of her estimate. In (76)b, the
speaker tries to convince her husband that he is wrong.
  Day (1980) has the following examples. She mentions that these are very
common in preaching.(77) a    a‐wësh‐tijti=naja           tishilë    tuwa=la=yu

proposition, and he considers it as being highly relevant or noteworthy. Day
mentions another use of this combination, to mark astonishment, which I have not
encountered:(79) a    bëmë‐ø=w=la=ye
          much;many‐3=PL=VAL=NB.F

          ATT‐DEM     eat‐1PL.S=VAL=SE
          ‘This is what we eat.’ (OR‐19MA‐20)In (80)a and b the combination =la and =se seems to mark determination or
conviction. In (80)a, which has already been discussed above, the speaker tries to
convince the hearer that something is possible, in spite of the fact that the hearer
thinks otherwise. In (80)b the speaker does not believe her son who said he was
sad for no reason. She thinks there must be a reason. In (80)c, however, the
meaning is slightly different. The speaker has just been telling about the founding
father of the Yurakaré, Tiri, and how he transformed all kinds of animals, so that
the Yurakaré Indians would have food. The utterance in (80)c is explanatory: ‘And
so this is what we eat, you see’.","[278, 279]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
5.3 Middle voice and causative5.3.1 Middle voice
Middle events involve “a set of loosely linked semantic subdomains centering roughly
around the direct reflexive.” (Kemmer 1993:238). Even though this definition roughly
describes many of the uses of the middle marker ‐tA 14 in Yurakaré, there are some
instances that do not fit Kemmer’s semantic characterization of middle events.
  According to Kemmer, the middle marker indicates a low elaboration of events.
There are two types of low elaboration of events; both have in common that there is a
potential alternative conceptualization event with a distinguishable initiator and
endpoint:
    (i)      low degree of distinguishability of participants (e.g. reflexive, body actions)
    (ii)     non‐identification of causer (passives, spontaneous events)
Yurakaré tends to mark both these types for middle voice; in what follows I will
mention the domains with the middle marker ‐tA.
  First of all, reflexive and reciprocal events are marked with this suffix:(67) a   chërë‐y
          pinch‐1SG.S
         ‘I pinch him.’
     b   chërë‐të‐y
         pinch‐MID‐1SG.S
         ‘I pinch myself.’ [MH‐11MA‐12](68) a   ti‐buyusa‐ø
         1SG‐kiss‐3
         ‘He kisses me.’
     b   buyusa‐ta‐ø=w
         kiss‐MID‐3=PL
         ‘They kiss each other.’ [FP‐15MA‐3]The middle marker suffices to distinguish reflexive from reciprocal and both from
other domains of the middle marker. However, there are heavier forms for the reflexive
end the reciprocal. Reciprocals (as well as some reflexives) can be additionally marked
with the prefix an‐ or am‐ 15:
14 The vowel normally adapts in place and manner to the preceding vowel if this is a low or mid
vowel.
15 With verbs beginning with /i/ this marker changes to in‐ or im‐.","[184, 185]"
"/®3/
Voiced post‐alveolar fricative 3; speakers are aware of the phonetic difference with
the Spanish trills and flaps, which are always adapted to the fricative:(14) u®3ina     ‘deer’ (<Sp. urina)Oppositions with /s/ and /S/ have been shown above.    (iii)     nasalsYurakaré has three phonemic nasals: /m/, /n/ and /¯/./m/
Bilabial nasal; it is in phonemic contrast with /b/ and with the other nasals:(15) a      mQQ         ‘you (sg)’
            bQQ         ‘tacuara tree’
      b     ama         ‘which, what’
            ana         ‘this’
      c     ¯uta        ‘bastard son’
            muta        ‘He says to them.’/n/
Alveolar nasal; its pronunciation depends on the following consonant. In between
vowels it has no allophones. Before bilabial consonants, /n/ is pronounced [m],
before palatal consonants as [¯], and before velar/alveolar consonants as [N]:
2 The form /bAkta/ is a combination of an ideophone /bAk/ plus middle marker /ta/.
Ideophones are often phonologically deviant (cf. Schachter 1985:21). Nevertheless,
ideophones ending in /k/ usually lenite to /h/ when followed by the suffix /ta/, e.g. /Sˆbˆk/
‘shattered’ > /Sˆbˆhta/ ‘shatter’.
3
  This is the same sound as the ‘r’ in the /dr/ cluster of the English ‘dream’.",[40]

The clause
marked by the fact that subject agreement and TMA marking are not present on
the deranked predicate.
  Subordinate forms with =ya are also deranked; they show no subject agreement
and in their marking of TMA distinctions they are dependent on the main
predicate. There are also independent clauses marked with =ya. In those
circumstances =ya indicates non‐veridical modality (cf. section 7.1.1).
  The column under =ja has two ‘+’‐values. With this I mean that there are both
balanced and deranked constructions marked with =ja. I will discuss the relevant
conditions in 8.2.3 below.
  Clauses marked with =ti have the full range of possibilities for marking TMA
and person marking. The difference with the balanced versions of =ja‐marked
clauses is that the =ja clauses must have the same subject as the main predicate 14,
while =ti marked clauses normally have a subject different from that of the main
predicate. Moreover, =ti is the only subordinating morpheme that can be further
specified by means of a postposition (cf. section 8.2.4).
  In the last column of Table 51, there is an unmarked, balanced combination of
clauses. This means that the combined predicates each have the full range of
possibilities of person marking and TMA‐marking. The meaning of the
combination can be specified by means of an independent word. Most of these
constructions are coordinated.
  The five strategies mentioned in Table 51 form a continuum: from left to right
the grammatical integration with the main predicate is increasingly lower.
According to Givón (2001b:40), “the stronger the semantic bond between the two
events, the more extensive will be the syntactic integration of the two clauses into
a single though complex clause”. This means that a decline of grammatical
coherence should coincide with a decrease of semantic coherence with the main
predicate.
  In the next sections (8.2.1‐8.2.5) I will describe the five strategies used for clause
combining in turn, indicating their formal and functional properties. In section
8.2.6 I give some alternative strategies used to encode clause combinations. In
section 8.2.7, finally, I will give an overview of the types of clause combinations
and the way they are marked.","[305, 306]"

          ‘They always hammered until they were caught by the night.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)In (83)a, there is a simple predicate ensew, modified by the adverb chajti, which directly
follows it. Even though I have never encountered chajti in preverbal position, it does
not seem impossible, especially when the meaning is stressed.
  This adverb often has a wide scope. In (83)a, the scope of the adverb extends to the
location mentioned. They did not ‘always just drink’, but ‘they always drank there’. In
(83)b, the adverb has scope over the entire proposition isamaya malaya chërë. And for
(83)c, finally, the same argumentation can be given: the adverb has scope over the
whole proposition. In addition, the repetition in this example already indicates
iterativity.
  There can be elements in between the predicate and the adverb, like direct objects, cf.
(84)a, applied objects, cf. (84)b, and even adjuncts, cf. (84)c:(84) a    ñowwo idu=ya            tiya‐ø    lëtta ñowwo chajti=ya        a‐yee

          ‘They always waited for their husbands like that with chicha.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)It may very well be the case that chajti has a verbal origin, and to some extent it still
functions as a predicate. There are two parts recognizable within the word: cha and jti.
The latter is the marker for habitual aspect, and the former is seen in many words
based on the demonstrative ati (cf. section 4.4.4 above):(85) ati          ‘that’
     achu(ta)     ‘(be) like that’
     (a)chama     ‘(do/be) like that’The word chajti then probably means ‘it is (was) always like that’. Another clue
pointing to the verbal nature of chajti, is the fact that it often occurs with the non‐                                           213
A grammar of Yurakaré
veridical enclitic =ya, normally only associated with predicates (cf. section 7.1.1). On the
other hand, it does not fully behave like a verb in the sense that when two clauses are
combined there often is an intonation break and morphological marking on the
dependent predicate; if there is no intonation break, there is a fixed order, in which the
dependent predicate precedes the main predicate. Chajti does not comply with this
behavior.
  The adverb lacha ‘too’ or its variant layj also seems to have a relation to the
demonstrative ati, with the specificity prefix l‐. Positionally, lacha is mostly postverbal,
either directly following the predicate or with some other element in between:(86) a   latijsha ma‐dyuja‐jti‐ø=ya       lacha mororuma              ma‐la‐deche‐ø=ti

         ma‐tomete lacha
         3PL‐arrow too
         ‘Then the ancestors made their arrows as well.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)In (86)a, the focus is on the mountain person’s characteristics, after telling what they
looked like and how they behaved, the adverb lacha contrasts this characteristic with
others of the mororuma. In (86)b, the former grandfathers are contrasted with other
people who are also fishing at the creek. In (86)c, finally, the whole proposition of the
former grandfathers making their arrows is marked with the adverb.
  Lacha can, however, also be in clause‐initial position:(87) layj tuwa       ta‐tebe       ana    emme
     too 1PL:PRN 1PL‐benefit DEM          meat
     ‘This too was going to be our meat.’ (OR‐19MA‐20)6.5.3 Modal and phasal adverbs
Unlike temporal and aspectual adverbs, modal adverbs tend to precede the predicate.
The negative adverb nish (~nij), the phasal adverbs kaj ‘still’, and kani ‘not yet’ as well
as sey (si) ‘almost’ directly precede the predicate:
                                         214

monosyllabic, while there is a prohibition on monosyllabic content words. This is
something that they have in common with a number of state/manner adverbs (cf.
section 6.5.6). Manner adverbs, as we will see below, are also preverbal.
  Some of the modal adverbs are morphologically transparent. The negative adverb
nish has an independent form nijta (i.e. which can occur without a verb), which seems
to be nij + ta (middle voice marker) meaning, ‘there is no(ne)’. The form nish has ‐sh,
which is an adverbializing suffix. The adverb kani also seems to be a fused form,
combining kaj and ni (negative).
  Two further, epistemic modal adverbs seem to be intermediate between adverbs and
verbs: yokkoshe ‘true’ and kusuti ‘maybe’.(89) a    yokkoshe tiya‐m           mem=la         tiya‐m=ja         ku‐tu=ya
          true        eat‐2SG.S mother=VAL         eat‐2SG.S=SS      3SG.CO‐say:3PL=NVR
          ‘“Did your really eat it, mother?” they said to her.’ (AR‐8MI‐25)
      b   kusuti lëshie shuwi‐ø=ti mapa‐kka‐ø=ya                latiji
          maybe two         moon‐3=DS big‐MEA‐3=NVR             subsequently
          ‘After maybe two months, he was already big.’ (AR‐8MI‐27)In (89) yokkoshe and kusuti are used adverbially here. Yokkoshe, however, can occur by
itself, without a predicate to modify, a characteristic not associated with adverbs in
Yurakaré:(90) yokkoshe mem=la            nish     ta‐n‐shiwa‐m=la          ku‐ta‐ø=w=ya
     true          mother=VAL NEG        1PL‐IO‐lie‐2SG.S=VAL     3SG.CO‐say‐3=PL=NVR
     ‘“It is true, mother, you did not lie to us”, they said to her.’ (AR‐8MI‐31)
                                             215
A grammar of Yurakaré
The end of the first clause yokkoshe memla is marked by the affirmative marker =la, this
means that yokkoshe here functions as a predicate.
  Kusuti seems to be a fixed expression which can be analyzed as kusu‐ø=ti, ‘if it wants’.
Kusu is a verb meaning ‘to want’, =ti is a subordinating enclitic, expressing, among
other things conditionality (cf. section 8.2.4).","[227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"

3.1 Introducing Yurakaré morphology
From the perspective of morphological typology, Yurakaré can be characterized as
an agglutinating language. In the ideal case of an agglutinating language “a word
may consist of more than one morpheme, but the boundaries between morphemes
in the word are always clear‐cut” (Comrie 1989a:43). This characterization fits
Yurakaré morphology to a high degree. There is some fusion, however, especially
within the system of participant reference on the verb. Here the categories of
person and number are fused, and sometimes also semantic function (e.g. in the
cross‐referencing system, cf. section 5.1). On the whole, however, Yurakaré
morphology provides us with a fairly straightforward picture of an agglutinating
language.
  On another dimension, isolating versus polysynthetic, Yurakaré can be placed
more towards the polysynthetic end, as was suggested already by the morpheme
per word ratio. I take polysynthetic to mean the possibility “to combine a large
number of morphemes, be they lexical or grammatical, into a single word,
corresponding to a sentence of English” (Comrie 1989a:45). Yurakaré, with its
elaborate person reference system and applicatives (cf. sections 5.1 and 5.2) fits
this description. To give an example, consider the following:(1)   a    ti‐ma‐y‐mala‐ma
           1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG
           ‘Go and get them for me!’ [AA‐15MA‐9]
      b    ti‐ma‐la‐che‐ø
           1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐3
           ‘He ate them from me (e.g. from my plate).’ [MV‐14MA‐26]
1I have not counted zero morphemes and I have counted bound roots + required
derivational morphemes as one. I did count enclitics. The total number of words was 6,976,
the total number of morphemes 14,289.",[62]
"
8.2.6 Alternative strategies
Apart from the strategies discussed above there are a few alternative strategies
that can be used to combine two predicates into a single sentence.
  First, there is an enclitic =jcha (=cha after a consonant) which Day (1980‐38)
describes as meaning ‘as soon as, just as’. In some circumstances, it seems to mean
just that:(124) pututu‐tu=jcha       süsh süsh süsh süsh mala‐ø=ya 31 mënñu
      loose‐MID:3PL.S=DPT IDEO IDEO IDEO IDEO go.SG‐3=NVR deer
      ‘As soon as they desentangled themselves they fled “süsh süsh”’. (OR‐19MA‐20)On the other hand, there are instances where this interpretation does not fit well:(125) l‐ati=jsha   mala‐ø=jcha willë=y bë‐l‐ati=sh=la=ra
      REF‐DEM=ABL go.SG‐3=DPT       far=LOC ATT‐REF‐DEM=ABL=VAL=NB.M
      ‘When you depart from there it is still a long way!’ (FL‐27MA‐10)Nevertheless, a connection between the examples (124) and (125) is imaginable
along the lines of two temporally adjacent events. Therefore I gloss =jcha
‘departitive’, indicating that one event departs from the other. It is possible for31   I have no explanation for the fact that the verb is marked for singular in this instance.",[339]

A grammar of Yurakaré
(23) a   pii        ‘older brother of a woman’
         pˆˆ        ‘road’
     b   wiwi       ‘boy’
         wewe       ‘he chews it into mass’/ˆ/
Unrounded mid‐vowel; this vowel is common in Amazonian languages (cf. Dixon
& Aikhenvald 1999:8). There is some speaker variation in that some speakers tend
to pronounce this phoneme as [y]. As shown above, it stands in phonemic contrast
with /i/; it can also be contrasted with /u/:(24) mˆta       ‘He pulls it out’
     muta       ‘He says to them.’/u/
The high back vowel is stable in quality. As shown above it stands in contrast with
/ˆ/. It is also distinguished from /o/ which has allophone [ç]:(25) uSpe       ‘he bathes’
     çSpe       ‘new’/e/ and /o/
The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ differ in quality depending on whether they are in an
open or closed syllable. In the latter environment they are lowered to [] and [ç]
respectively. As shown in (25), /o/ contrasts with /u/. The vowel /e/ can be
contrasted with /Q/; /o/ can be contrasted with /a/:(26) a   tQhtQ      ‘leg’
         tehte       ‘grandmother’
     b   Sonko      ‘hole’
         Sonka      ‘he makes a hole’/Q/
This low front vowel is a marked sound in the region, and one of the sounds that
make Yurakaré sound distinct from neighboring languages. Its phonemic status
can be proven by contrasting it to the nearest sounds in the system /e/ (see
example (26) above) and /a/:(27) tQjle      ‘I know it.’
     tajle      ‘We know it.’
                                            28
Phonology
/a/
The mid‐low vowel completes the series of Yura distinctive vowel phonemes. It
has an allophone [A] in closed syllables. For minimal pairs with /o/ and /Q/, see
examples (25) and (26)above, respectively.","[42, 43, 44]"

SamenvattingDit proefschrift geeft een overzicht van de basiskenmerken van de grammatica
van het Yurakaré. Yurakaré is een Indianentaal gesproken door ongeveer 2500
mensen in een groot gebied in centraal Bolivia, aan de voet van de Andes. Het
boek bestaat uit acht hoofdstukken, en is als volgt opgebouwd.
  Hoofdstuk 1 ‘Introduction’ geeft relevante geografische, demografische en
historische achtergronden van de Yurakaré indianen. Vervolgens wordt op
schetsmatige wijze de Yurakaré taal besproken: eerdere studies van de taal,
mogelijke familietalen en een korte typologische schets. Het laatste deel van dit
hoofdstuk is toegespitst op het huidige onderzoek. Hier wordt besproken hoe het
veldonderzoek is verlopen, wat voor technieken er zijn gebruikt en wie de
consultanten waren. Ook in dit deel een samenvatting van de belangrijkste
mythologische teksten.
  Hoofdstuk 2 behandelt de fonologie van de taal. In het eerste deel worden de
betekenisonderscheidende klanken van de taal geïntroduceerd, waar nodig
worden de klanken gecontrasteerd met andere klanken. Ook wordt in dit deel kort
besproken wat er gebeurt met niet inheemse klanken die opgenomen worden in
de taal. In het tweede gedeelte wordt beschreven hoe deze klanken worden
gerepresenteerd in het orthografisch systeem. Syllabestructuur, fonologische
processen en een beschrijving van het klemtoonsysteem sluiten het hoofdstuk af.
  Hoofdstuk 3 is een introductie van de morfologie (woordvorming) van het
Yurakaré. Hier vindt men een beschrijving van alle typen morfemen en
woordvormingsprocessen van de taal (woorden, stammen, prefixen, suffixen,
reduplicatie, samenstellingen, clitica en woordinterne veranderingen). Ook wordt
hier beargumenteerd welke lexicale klassen worden onderscheiden en op basis
waarvan. Het Yurakaré telt zeven woordklassen: naamwoorden, bijvoeglijke
naamwoorden, werkwoorden, bijwoorden, ideofonen, interjecties en enclitische
partikels.
  In hoofdstuk 4 wordt de interne structuur en de morfologie van de
naamwoordfrase besproken. Eerst worden categorieën die relevant zijn voor de
naamwoordfrase als geheel besproken, zoals getal en de markering van
grammaticale relaties door middel van postposities. Vervolgens worden de twee
woordsoorten die met name voorkomen binnen de naamwoordfrase afzonderlijk
besproken. Eerst naamwoorden, met daarbij een beschrijving van de uitdrukking
van bezit, derivationele morfologie en een subclassificatie van de naamwoorden,
daarna volgt een bespreking van de bijvoeglijke naamwoorden die in twee
subklassen worden verdeeld: kwalificerende en kwantificerende bijvoeglijke
naamwoorden.
  Hoofdstuk 5 richt zich op hoe participanten in een situatie of gebeurtenis
worden gemarkeerd op het werkwoord voor de rol die ze in die situatie hebben.
Er wordt uitgegaan van een basis markeringssysteem waarin het onderwerp en
                                      359
A grammar of Yurakaré
het lijdend voorwerp op het werkwoord gemarkeerd worden; op basis hiervan
wordt uitgelegd hoe deze basisstructuur van twee participanten kan worden
uitgebreid met allerlei applicatieve constructies. In het tweede gedeelte wordt
voice besproken: de middle voice en de causatief.
  In hoofdstuk 6 wordt verbale morfologie besproken: tense, mood en aspect
alsmede derivationele morfologie die op het werkwoord gemarkeerd wordt. Ook
is er in dit hoofdstuk een bespreking te vinden van de categorieën die nauw
samenhangen met de werkwoordsfrase: adverbia en ideofonen, alsmede een
bespreking van interjecties.
  Hoofdstuk 7 geeft een beschrijving van allerlei verschillende enclitische
partikels, waarvan de meeste gezien kunnen worden als modaal. Er zijn ook een
aantal aspectuele markeerders bij. De focus in dit hoofdstuk ligt op een eerste
benadering van deze partikels, waarbij veel aandacht is voor de context waarin ze
voorkomen en de plaats binnen de zin die ze innemen.
  In hoofdstuk 8, tenslotte, wordt de structuur van de zin besproken. Het eerste
gedeelte behandelt de simplexe zin, met één predikaat en één tot drie argumenten.
Besproken wordt pro‐drop, de plaats van de argumenten en het werkwoord in de
zin, pragmatische status van argumenten en soorten zinnen. Het tweede gedeelte
richt zich op combinaties van twee of meer predikaten binnen een zin. Het
behandelt de verschillende types van combinaties, waarbij uitgegaan wordt van
een switch‐reference systeem dat ten grondslag ligt aan veel adverbiale zinnen,
relatieve zinnen en zinscomplementen. Tenslotte worden in dit hoofdstuk
strategieën besproken die gebruikt worden om predicaten te combineren buiten
het systeem van switch‐reference om.
  In de appendix zijn nog twee voorbeelden te vinden van gesproken tekst. Een
mythologisch verhaal, Ayma Shunñe (Vuurman), dat integraal is opgenomen en
een gedeelte van een conversatie tussen drie personen.","[368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375]"

5.3.2 Causative
There are a number of different strategies to mark causative. As far as morphological
marking of the causative is concerned, we can distinguish four patterns, and a rest
group that does not fit well in either of these patterns. The first group has a middle
form ending in ‐tA and a causative form ending in ‐che:(93) a   sawata   ‘work’          vs.      sawache   ‘make work’
     b   boleta   ‘inflate (i)’   vs.      boleche   ‘inflate (t)’
     c   shuta    ‘move away (i)’ vs.      shuche    ‘relocate’ The second group reduplicates the first syllable of the root, which is in opposition to a
form marked with ‐tA:(94) a   përujta   ‘turn over (i)’   vs.    përujpë        ‘turn over (t)
     b   posojto   ‘explode (i)’     vs.    posojpo        ‘explode (t)
     c   shudyujta ‘hide (i)’        vs.    shudyujshu     ‘hide (t)’These first two are the most frequently encountered patterns. Then there is a handful of
verbs that has a causative form with a reduplicated last syllable of the root (minus the
marker ‐ta):
                                           178
Verbal agreement, voice & valency
(95) a    yupata ‘go in (pl)’        vs.        yupapa     ‘cause to go in’
     b    punata ‘burn (i)’          vs.        punana     ‘burn (t)’
     c    shuñete ‘grow’             vs.        shuñeñe    ‘cause to grow, raise’Furthermore there is a small group of two verbs found so far, that does reduplicate the
last syllable of the root, however without losing the middle marker ‐tA:(96) a    dyulujta    ‘be scared’         vs.     dyululujta    ‘scare’
     b    iñuta       ‘be ashamed’        vs.     iñuñuta       ‘cause shame’This pattern has already been described in section 3.2.3 in relation to distributive.
 Finally, there are three deviant forms:(97) a    nometa      ‘move (i)’                vs.   nomenome      ‘move (t)’
     b    shojto      ‘be afraid’               vs.   shojñe        ‘make afraid’
     c    arapta      ‘break, snap (i)’         vs.   aramba        ‘break, snap (t)’The word nomenome ‘cause to move’ reduplicates the entire syllable minus ‐ta of its
non‐causative counterpart; shojñe does not reduplicate but adds ‐ñe, and finally aramba
does not have an entirely transparent relation with its middle counterpart. The effects
of these different strategies are the same. A causative form marked by ‐che does not
seem to be different from a causative marked by a reduplicate form.
  Apart from the strategies mentioned above, there is an alternative strategy to mark a
causative form. This is a periphrastic causative with the verb ibëbë ‘to treat someone in
a certain way’. The causer is encoded as the subject of this verb, the causee as the object
of the same verb. Ibëbë, being an i‐verb (cf. section 5.2.6), has the following conjugation
of objects:(98) ti‐m‐bë‐ø       ‘he caused me’         ta‐m‐bë‐ø          ‘he caused us’
     mi‐m‐bë‐ø       ‘he caused you’        pa‐m‐bë‐ø          ‘he caused you(pl)’
     ibëbë‐ø         ‘he caused him’        ma‐m‐bë‐ø          ‘he caused them’In most forms, the second bë is lost. This might be for reasons of stress. The first
syllable of all forms except ibëbë is a heavy syllable, i.e. it attracts stress. Since
extrametricality of the last syllable and iambic foot structure prohibit any other syllable
in this word to receive stress, this first syllable would be followed by two unstressed
and identical syllables. In these environments vowels or syllables tend to be deleted in
Yurakaré (cf. section 2.3.5).
  In fact, the second bë seems to be a reduplicated suffix marking causative; ibëbë has a
middle marked counterpart imbë‐të, where a nasal element is placed inside the root
(this only happens with i‐verbs) to indicate valency decrease, so that we can contrast
i<m‐>bë‐të with ibë~bë.","[193, 194]"

5.2.6 Verbs beginning with /i/
                                            160
Verbal agreement, voice & valency
Transitive verbs beginning with the sound /i/ usually mark their direct object in a
deviant way. First and second persons and the third person plural are encoded as an
indirect object:(36) a    ti‐n‐dëjta‐m
          1SG‐IO‐miss‐2SG.S
          ‘You miss me.’ [MH‐8MA‐14]
      b   lëshie=w ma‐n‐du‐shti               palanta=w
          two=PL      3PL‐IO‐fry‐FUT:1SG.S    banana=PL
          ‘I am going to fry two bananas.’ [FL‐23MA‐1]
      c    ti‐n‐dumaja‐yu
          1SG‐IO‐molest‐PROH
          ‘Don’t bother me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]
      d   së=ja             ma‐n‐ñese‐shti              palanta=w
          1SG.PRN=EMPH 3PL‐IO‐sow;plant‐FUT:1SG.S banana=PL
          ‘I am going to plant bananas.’ [FL‐20MA‐27]Underlyingly, all of the verb roots in (36) begin with the vowel /i/: idëjta ‘to miss’, idu
‘to fry’, idumaja ‘to molest’ and iñese ‘to sow, plant’. The participant encoded as an
indirect object here is slightly different from normal indirect‐object marking. The third
person singular is cross‐referenced with zero, i.e. as a ‘normal’ direct object, which is
evidence that we are in fact not dealing with indirect objects, but rather with direct
objects that are marked in a deviant manner:(37) a    idu‐ma       palanta
          fry‐IMP.SG   banana
          ‘Fry a banana!’ [HC‐23MA‐3]
     b    ëshë idumaja‐shta‐m=chi        mi‐tëjte
          why molest‐FUT‐2SG.S=IGN 2SG‐grandmother
          ‘Why are you going to bother, cause trouble to your grandmother?’ (AR‐8MI‐46)Apparently there is some rule that says that the direct objects of transitive verb roots
beginning with /i/ are encoded as indirect objects, except for third person singular.
When for instance a beneficiary or a recipient is added, this is expressed as an affected
object:(38) ti‐l‐idu‐ma
     1SG‐AFO‐fry‐IMP.SG
     ‘Fry it for me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]The affected object applied to a verb beginning with /i/ differs slightly in form, in that
the /a/ of the prefix la‐ is dropped:
                                          161
A grammar of Yurakaré
  However, there are instances where the indirect object does indicate a beneficiary, as
in the case with idu ‘fry’:(39) ti‐n‐du‐ma
     1SG‐IO‐fry‐IMP.SG
     ‘Fry it for me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]It may be that the pragmatically marked meaning that a direct object interpretation
would yield here, forces the indirect object interpretation. Nevertheless, it is unclear
what the difference is between (38) and (39). In most cases the affected object takes over
the ‘vacancy’ left open by the indirect object, marking beneficiary/recipient‐type
participants:(40) a   ti‐l‐irepu‐ø
         1SG‐AFO‐tie‐3
         ‘He tied it for me.’
     b   ti‐l‐iñese‐ma
         1SG‐AFO‐sow;plant‐IMP.SG
         ‘Sow it for me!’
     c   ti‐l‐inëmë‐ø
         1SG‐AFO‐divide‐3
         ‘He divides it (e.g. meal) for me.’
     d   ti‐l‐itele‐ø
         1SG‐AFO‐set.free‐3
         ‘He sets it free for me (e.g. chicken).’Comitative object and cooperative‐object marking is no different with i‐verbs than with
other verbs:(41) a   ka‐y‐mal‐uma‐y               ti‐bëshë     a‐mumuy
         3SG‐VPL‐go.SG‐DST‐1SG.S      1SG‐entity   3SG.P‐all
         ‘I am bringing all my stuff (going back and forth).’
     b   ku‐ydu‐ma
         3SG.CO‐fry‐IMP.SG
         ‘Help him fry it!’5.2.7 Experiencers
Experiencers can be encoded in several ways, depending on the verb stem. Some are
encoded as subjects:

Verbal agreement, voice & valency
(42) a    ma‐bëjta‐y
          3PL‐see‐1SG.S
          ‘I see them.’
      b   të‐dyojlo‐m
          1SG.CO‐be.angry‐2SG.S
          ‘You are angry with me.’However, many experiencers are not encoded as subjects; they can be encoded in
several ways depending on the verb semantics:(43) a    ma‐yle                (comitative object) 9
          3PL‐know
          ‘They know it.’
      b   ti‐jusu               (direct object) 10
          1SG‐want
          ‘I want it.’
      c   ti‐n‐kukku            (indirect object)
          1SG‐IO‐nice
          ‘I like it.
      d   ti‐la‐ñolele          (affected object)
          1SG‐AFO‐desirable
          ‘I desire it.’Some impersonal weather verbs can carry cooperative‐object experiencers, like
experiencers of temperature:(44) a    të‐dyummë‐ø
          1SG.CO‐cold‐3
          ‘I am cold.’
     b    ku‐shujuta‐ø
          3SG.CO‐warm‐3
          ‘He is warm, sweating.’ [AA‐12MA‐28]Cooperative objects can also be sympathetic experiencers:
9 An alternative analysis would be that we are dealing with a verb le with a purposive object.
This would mean that we should analyze le as a movement verb. There is one other cognitive
verb that is based on a movement verb:
i. ku‐y‐mal‐uma‐ø
     3SG.CO‐VPL‐go.SG‐DST‐3
     ‘He is thinking.’
10 The fact that we are dealing with a direct object here is evidenced by the fact that a thirdperson singular is cross‐referenced by a zero form.","[175, 176, 177, 178]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
when dealing with third persons – plus the ignorative =chi. In (128)b, however, the
counterfactual clause is marked with the future marker ‐shta. The counterfactual
interpretation comes solely from the marker ‐ta, consider (129):(129) a   nij    ka‐la‐bbë‐ti              oshewo tiyu=y=chi              talipa=w ti‐chata
          NEG 3SG‐AFO‐cover‐POT:1SG.S pot             eat:3PL.S=NVR=IGN chicken=PL 1SG‐food
          ‘If I had not covered the pot, the chickens would have eaten all.’ [MH‐31MA‐6]
     b    nij ka‐la‐bbë‐y=ti                  tiya=w titib        talipaw
          NEG 3SG‐AFO‐cover‐1SG.S=DS          eat‐3=PL 1SG‐pet chicken=PL
          ‘When I did not cover it, my chickens ate it.’ [MH‐31MA‐6]The conditional clauses in these counterfactual constructions apparently do not
need a subordinating morpheme. They are, however, marked by means of
intonation. The conditional clause ends in a rising intonation associated with
subordinate clauses in Yurakaré.
  There is also an alternative morphological strategy to encode subject relative
clauses, by means of a compound form: predicate + bëshë ‘entity’, which is often
shortened to pshë:(130) a   ayma=la bobo‐shta‐ø=ya             latiji          na       shuñe~ñe‐pshë
          fire=INS    hit;kill‐FUT‐3=NVR     subsequently DEM         man~CAU‐entity
          ‘With fire he was going to kill the one that raised him.’ (AR‐8MI‐52)
     b    ku‐dojlo‐shti              na    shunñe      ti‐bobo‐pshë
          3SG.CO‐scold‐FUT:1SG.S DEM man               1SG‐hit;kill‐entity
          ‘I am going to scold the man that hit me.’ [VL‐24MA‐13]I have found one instance of a possessive relative clause marked with ‐bëshë:(131) latijsha na    nish  wiwi‐pshë=w          ma‐ba=w           ati=w
      then     DEM NEG     arrive.PL‐entity=PL 3PL‐husband=PL     DEM=PL
      adyindyi‐jti‐ø=w=ya
      sad‐HAB‐3=PL=NVR
      ‘The ones whose husbands had not returned were sad.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)A final strategy used for combining two or more predicates is the direct speech
strategy. Reported speech is always encoded as direct speech and almost always
in combination with the verb ta ‘say’ in Yurakaré, even though there are instances
of direct speech without any communication verb. The verb ta ‘say’ cannot take
indirect speech complements.","[340, 341]"

Verbal agreement, voice & valency
  There is no difference in subject marking between intransitive and transitive verb
stems. The main difference between intransitive and transitive roots is that, in the
unmarked case, the former simply lack the object paradigm.(1)   a   dele‐m
          fall.SG‐2SG.S
          ‘You fall.’
      b   ti‐bobo‐m
          1SG‐hit;kill‐2SG.S
          ‘You hit me.’If a transitive verb lacks object markers, the interpretation is that there is a third person
singular object:(2)   bobo‐m
      hit;kill‐2SG.S
      ‘You hit him.’There are, however, instances such as the following:(3)   a   mala‐m
          go.SG‐2SG.S
          ‘You (sg) go.’
      b   ti‐mala‐m
          1SG‐go.SG‐2SG.S
          ‘You take me.’
      c   ka‐mala‐ø      (a‐nñu)
          3SG‐go.SG‐3 (3SG.P‐baby)
          ‘She took it (her baby).’ (AR‐8MI‐25)The root mala ‘go’ is intransitive, but seems to behave as a labile verb which might be
used intransitively, as in (3)a, or transitively, as in (3)b and c. However, I consider the
constructions in (3)b and c to be extended intransitives, and the marker ka‐ in these
constructions as an applied object, marking third person singular comitative, to be
discussed in more detail in 5.2.1. Extended intransitives of this type can be contrasted
with ‘real’ transitives on two accounts.
  First, with transitive roots, the unmarked case is that there is no overt marking of the
third person singular direct object on the verb, but there is an alternative overt marker
ka‐. This marker appears on an inherently transitive verb root in limited circumstances,
depending on the type of noun it refers to.","[159, 160]"
