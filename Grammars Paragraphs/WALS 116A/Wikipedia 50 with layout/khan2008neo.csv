"19.1.2.1. Demonstrative Pronoun as Head
A nominal relative clause that contains the relative particle D in principle
must have some kind of pronominal head. The particle D itself, although
historically a pronoun in origin, no longer functions as a pronoun and
cannot act as the head of the relative clause. Nominal relative clauses
often take pronominal heads in the form of an anaphoric demonstrative
pronoun placed before the D particle. This is usually the default series of
demonstratives, though occasionally speaker deixis demonstratives are used
in this way. The anaphoric pronoun refers proleptically to the referent
described in the relative clause and is not dependent on mention in the
preceding context. All such constructions are restrictive relatives:  (1) ""o-t-íle plíxa ""àw bt-áx6l.} ‘He who has worked will eat.’ (A21:15)
  (2) ""ó-t là pál6x} lè y-áx6l.} ‘He who does not work will not eat.’ (A21:13)
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                          965  (3)   ""o-t-†áy6n nàše,} †áy6n mêndi,} ""áw y-amríle ˙ammàla.} ‘Somebody who
        carries people, carries something, he is called a porter.’ (A22:36)
  (4)   ""o-t-ítle dawˆra} máßle dawˆre.} ‘Whoever had a pack animal, would
        bring down his pack animal.’ (B5:120)
  (5)   ""a-t-ìla †láli} ""awðánna trè-q6sme.} ‘The one that is for me I’ll divide
        into two parts.’ (A21:28)
  (6)   ""an-t-íla qam-t8ra t-á°i gawàye.} ‘The ones that are outside come
        inside.’ (B11:9)
  (7)   ràbb6n} ""áwwa t-i-sàx6ð l-""álaha} ""u-t-i-mßàle-u} lé-y-""ax6l bêsra-w} ‘A monk
        (is) somebody who worships God, who prays and does not eat
        meat.’ (A15:4)
  (8)   ""ánna t-íla gawàye} plí†ela qam-gùtta.} ‘The ones who are inside went
        out after the ball.’ (B11:11)
  (9)   ""ánna kúlla t-wiðìli qámux} ðìlux módila?} ‘All these things that I have
        done in front of you—do you know what they are?’ (A23:20)In (10) the pronominal head is combined with a partitive expression:  (10) ""o-m6nn7xu t-dàq6r} b-M9mo,} m-áxxa hál qaßr6t-mìra} t-oð•xle dêmma.}
       ‘Whoever of you touches M>mo, we shall scatter his blood from
       here until the palace of the prince.’ (A26:68)19.1.2.2. Indefinite Pronoun as Head
The cardinal particle xa may be used as an indefinite pronoun at the head
of a relative clause. In such cases it generally refers to a human referent
(‘anybody’, ‘somebody’). As is the norm with indefinite antecedents, the
construction is syndetic if the referent is non-specific (1) but asyndetic if
it has a specific referent (2)–(3):  (1)   l7le šwíqa xá t-xay•ple ""ím6t mày6°.} ‘He has not left anybody who
        would wash him when he dies.’ (D2:77)
  (2)   ""í°wa xá Pêtto-wewa š•mme.} ‘There was somebody whose name was
        P6tto’ (B19:5)
  (3)   ""í°wa xa-honàna-wewa.} ‘There was a person who was wise.’ (A14:8)In a similar manner, the quantifier raba can be used pronominally as an
indefinite head, as in (4):
966                           chapter nineteen  (4)   ""í°wa rába ""i-z>ríwala ‘èri.} ‘There were many who sowed it in
        Autumn.’ (B5:15)19.1.2.3. Quantifier kut as Head
A nominal relative may be introduced by the quantifier kut, which has
generic reference (‘whoever . . .’). This is derived historically from the phrase
*kul-xa-d < *kull-˙a≈-d ‘each one that’, which contains both the head of
the relative clause *˙a≈ ‘one’ and also the relative particle:  (1)   kùt la-pál6x} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a} ""ixála lè y-áx6l.} ‘Whoever does not work
        in this house will not eat food.’ (A21:13)
  (2)   kút ""á°e gu-""úpra dìyi} láz6m ""áw6ð ""askarìya.} ‘Whoever comes to my
        land, must serve in the army.’ (A17:22)
  (3)   kút ma†éwa qamáya jàld6lle} m5°èwale.} ‘Whoever was the quickest and
        reached it first would bring it back.’ (B5:154)
  (4)   kút šaqêlwale} ""aw-qrìmwale.} ‘Whoever picked it up would win.’
        (B15:33)
  (5)   kút-ile fer•ssa ""á°e ""àxxane.} ‘Whoever is a warrior, let him come here.’
        (A29:59)
  (6)   kut-b9y6t} t-yánn6x ""•lle dìye.} ‘Whoever you love, I’ll give you to him.’
        (A26:88)
  (7)   kut-m7°ela ""ána t-yánne zùze.} ‘Whoever brings her back, I’ll give
        money to him.’ (A27:30)
  (8)   ""alpá-dáwe b6d-yáw6l †la-kút ""am•rre mòdile x•lme.} ‘He will give a thou-
        sand gold pieces to whomsoever tells him what his dream is.’ (A1:12)
  (9)   ""u-sápr6t kut-á°e làxxa.} ‘Wait for whoever comes here.’ (A22:23)In (10) a nominal relative is used independently in a street call:  (10) qréli hátxa kut-záw6n tàwra?} ‘I cried out like this “(Is there) anybody
       who will buy an ox?” ’ (A22:7)19.1.2.4. Interrogative Particle as Head
A relative clause can be introduced by the interrogative particle mo/modi
‘what’. When linked to a following relative clause, this produces a nomi-
nal phrase that refers to a class of entities. In a similar type of structure,
the head of the clause may be an adverbial interrogative, such as ""5ka
‘Where?,’ which forms subordinate clauses with an adverbial function.
Relative clauses with interrogative particles as heads often have a generic
reference (‘whoever, whatever, wherever, etc.), especially when they are
placed at the beginning of the sentence.
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                        967(i) mo/modi  (1) mo-bt-amrálux bt-àwð6t.} ‘You must do what she says.’ (A8:92)
  (2) mšaróyela k°àwa} b5°wá°6t nàše} ""u-mo-t-itlèy.} ‘They start registering the
      houses of people and what they have’ (B1:16)When such relative phrases are in clause initial position, they are sometimes
resumed by a correlative element. In (3) and (4) this is the anaphoric adverbial
had6x. In (5) the correlative has the form of another interrogative pronoun:  (3) màlka} mo-t-ám6rrey t-óði hàd6x.} ‘Whatever the king tells them they
      should do.’ (A8:9)
  (4) mo-t-ámr6t wúð hàd6x.} ‘Do whatever you think best (literally: you say).’
      (A8:17)
  (5) módit snìqa} mo-t-óð6xxa †làlux.} ‘Whatever you want, (that is) what we
      shall do for you.’ (A6:9)In (1) and (5) the construction is asyndetic whereas in (2) it is syndetic.
When the verb in the relative clause is an initial / ""/ verb used in a future
sense, as in (3), (4) and the second phrase of (5), the status of the t- is
ambiguous, in that it may be interpreted either as the relative particle or
the future particle.
   Similar inclusive classes of entities can be expressed with relative phrases
introduced by the word m6ndi ‘thing’, which is often combined with the
universal quantifier ku- ‘every’. These constructions are either synthetic
or asyndetic, e.g.  (6) ""u-m•ndi-t pày6š} ""aß•rta xa-rámša xùlle.} ‘Whatever is left eat in the eve-
      ning for dinner.’ (A42:4)
  (7) kú-m6ndi-t b8y6t wùdli.} ‘Do to me whatever you want.’ (A25:14)
  (8) ku-m•ndi b8yi xoš-""òði.} ‘They may do whatever they want.’ (A14:46)
  (9) m5°íwa lêxma} yán bêsra,} yán ku-m6t-""ìle.} ‘They would bring bread or
      meat, or whatever there was.’ (B15:87)(ii) ""5ka
The attested examples of this include both synthetic constructions with
the D subordinator and also asyndetic ones without this particle, e.g.  (1) gu-d-5-dàna,} ""7k5y5wa mù†ye} p•lg6t yòma} táma y-axlíwa kùlla.} ‘At that
      time, wherever they had got to, at midday they all ate.’ (B5:62)
968                           chapter nineteen  (2) ""7ka ßà†qa} tàma z>réti.} ‘Wherever it (the dog) squats, there you should
      cultivate.’ (A30:4)
  (3) y-azíwa nablìwale} l-šaqì°a} yán l-hàmmam,} ""7k6t ""ìle.} ‘They went and
      took him to a channel or a wash house, wherever it was.’ (B15:74)A similar sense is expressed by relative clauses headed by the phrase ku-
dana ‘every time, any time’:  (4) ku-dána sànq6t,} maqðêtla,} ""ána t-á°y6n làxxa.} ‘Whenever you need (me),
      burn them and I shall come here’ (A24:49)19.1.2.5. No Head
Nominal relatives with no explicit syntactic expression of the head are
mainly found either after existential particles or in naming constructions
with the verb ""mr. In all cases the zero head has the sense of an indefinite
pronoun with a specific referent (‘some’, ‘something’) and the relative
clause is non-restrictive. In most cases the relative clause is asyndetic and
is not introduced by the particle:(i) Existential Constructions
These mainly refer to plural groups:  (1) ""í°wa zamríwa diwàne.} ‘There were some who would sing diwane.’
      (B5:11)
  (2) ""í°wa b>y7wa d5r7wa gêlla gáwa.} ‘There were some who liked to put
      herbs in it.’ (B5:167)
  (3) ""í°wa gu-""á°‰a har-šuléy ""àww5wa.} ‘There were some in the country
      whose job was (to do) this.’ (B5:168)In (4) and (5) the referent is singular:  (4) ""í° pál†a zùrta.} ""5-zúrta ""áy zadìwala.} ‘There was something (of the
      tobacco) that came out (as) small (pieces). This small stuff—they
      threw that away.’ (B7:17)
  (5) ""áw bròn-málka rába šapìr5le} ""u-hawnàn5le,} ""ína ""í° ""ax-díye ""áp-ay šapírta-
      w hawnánta brát6t málk6t ma""àrwa t-ámr6x.} ‘That son of a king is
      very good-looking and clever, but there is someone who is good-
      looking and clever like him, the daughter of the king of the West,
      let’s say (i.e. we shall give her this name for the sake of the story).’
      (A4:3)
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                        969In (6) the relative clause is syndetic, with the particle D:  (6) ""í°wa t-iw7wa ß•lye ˙abbanìyya} . . . mú°ye makày6n.} ‘There were some
      who had gone down to Óabbaniyya . . . and brought back machines.’
      (B10: 45)(ii) Naming Constructions
The name of the item in question takes the nuclear stress and is placed
either in the default position after the verb or is fronted before the verb
to give it added prominence:  (1) d5r7wa t-amr•xxa guttà°a.} ‘They put (on it) what we call “balls.” ’ (B5:39)
  (2) béna náše y-áwa mú°ye táma halbát t-amr•xxe kàde.} ‘People would have
      brought there what we call kade.’ (B5:59)
  (3) ""ánna ""íla prìsta y-amríwala ""7-ga.} ‘These things are what were called
      at that time “a spread.” ’ (B5:201)
  (4) ""í°wa hambišàye y-amr•xla.} ‘There were what we call “giants.” ’
      (A24:54)If the asyndetic relative phrase is the complement of a preposition, the
preposition remains on the noun it relates to, even when this noun is not
at the front of the phrase, e.g.  (5) kút-xa y-áwe gu-bˆ°e} ""u-heywáne y-áwa m•nne dìye,} har-gu-gòma y-amr•xxe.}
      ‘Everybody is in his home and his animals are with him, in what we
      call “the basement stable.” ’ (B5:116)
  (6) ""áw ""o-t-ítle qàmxa} nab•lle t-ámr6x l-tanùra.} ‘Somebody who has flour
      takes it to what we call the oven.’ (B5:117)When the item that is named has been mentioned previously and is definite,
it takes a demonstrative pronoun as the head of the relative phrase, e.g.  (7) qa-t-lá-ßala míya gàwe} d-ó t-ámr6x huðàla.} ‘so that the water does not go
      down into what we call a fodder stack.’ (B5:114)(iii) Other Cases
Asyndetic nominal relatives are sporadically found in other contexts, e.g.  (1) gu-má°a °éla m†éla l-be-""abòn5wa.} ‘They came to the village and went
      to what was the house of the bishop.’ (B1:17)
970                            chapter nineteen  (2) B•lb6l Hazàr} ""íle mú°y6lla lˆle ""úrza.} ‘B6lb6l Hazar—the one who
      brought her who was not a man.’ (A8:84)19.1.3. The Internal Structure of Relative Clauses
In syndetic relative clauses, which open with the particle D, the enclitic
copula is regularly attached to the particle. Ample illustration of this can
be found among the examples that are cited above. The copula is always
in its enclitic form. The emphatic copula is avoided in this syntactic con-
text (§15.3.3.). The phenomenon whereby the copula is attached to the
relative particle can be linked to the practice of moving the copula onto
prominent items in main clauses (§15.4.1.4.1., §17.1.1.2.). The item may
be a prominent focus of new information or may be topically prominent,
in that it is the central concern of the speaker. In relative clauses it is the
latter type of prominence that is involved. The referent of the antecedent
noun, represented by the D particle in the embedded clause, is the main
topical concern of the clause.
   On some occasions the copula bears the nuclear stress of the intona-
tion group, e.g.  (1) ""u-dí‰5le ß•ly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na,} ""5-""7na t-ìle ""•°ya qamáye réša.} ‘He went back
      down to the spring, the spring to which he had come previously.’
      (A26:32)
  (2) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ‘The day that he went out, his son
      died.’ (A4:32)If the relative clause is asyndetic, on the other hand, the copula is not
placed in initial position. In the attested examples of these constructions,
the copula is normally either attached to the predicate, e.g. §19.1.1.2. ii (1,
2, 8, 9), §19.1.2.2. (2, 3), or is omitted, e.g. §19.1.1.2. ii (5). An exceptional
case is (3), in which the copula is placed at the front of the clause, as in
syndetic constructions:  (3) hadíya mtán6nnux ða-q6ßßêtta} tunì°a} ""íle š•mma dìya} tála ""u-làql6q.} ‘Now
      I shall tell a story, a story whose name is “The fox and the stork.” ’
      (A45)When a syndetic relative clause contains a verb, this is regularly placed
immediately after the relative particle D, with a subject or any other
constituent following it, e.g.
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                        971  (4)   ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo,} yawíwala mêšxa.} ‘When (literally: at the time that)
        the bride came, they would give her oil.’ (B8:32)
  (5)   ""o-m6nn7xu t-dàq6r} b-M9mo} ‘whoever of you touches M>mo . . .’
        (A26:68)When the referent of a definite antecedent noun has the role of direct
object in the relative clause it is resumed by a pronominal object pronoun,
whether the clause is restrictive or non-restrictive, e.g.  (6)   ""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
        they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
  (7)   m•re †la-Zìne,} t-b>yéla M9mo} ‘He said to Zine, whom M>mo loved’
        (A26:64)The resumptive pronoun may be in a clause embedded within the rela-
tive clause, e.g.  (8)   ""7-baxta t-à°ya} b8y6n gawrênna} láz6m mtanyáli ða-q6ßßêtta.} ‘The woman
        who comes and I shall marry must tell me a story.’ (A36:1)In the relative clause of (9) the clause embedded under the verb b>y6t ‘you
want’ that would have contained the resumptive pronoun has been elided:  (9)   šêdla,} gu-d-a-""8ra t-b8y6t mattêtle.} ‘The sapling—you put it in the
        land that you want (to put it in).’ (B5:103)When the antecedent noun is indefinite with a non-specific referent and
the relative clause is restrictive, there is generally no resumptive pronomi-
nal direct object, e.g.  (10) hálli xá-m6ndi t-àxl6n.} ‘Give me something to eat (literally: that I
       may eat).’ (A26:57)
  (11) kú-mdit t-yáw6l †làlux} ""áp ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè.} ‘Everything that he
       gives to you, he will give also to your neighbour, twofold.’ (A3:4)
  (12) kú-m6ndit b9y6t,} módi m>r8d lêbbux} t-oðànne!} ‘Whatever you want,
       whatever your heart’s desire is, I shall do it!’ (A33:11)
  (13) ""áwwa kú-mdit mßaw•°wa ’ùxo,} ’ùxo,} ’ùxo.} ‘Everything that he
       spoke (= on every occasion that he spoke) (people would say) ’uxo,
       ’uxo, ’uxo.’ (A7:1)
972                            chapter nineteenWhen the interrogative pronoun mo ‘what’ functions as an indefinite pro-
noun at the head of a restrictive relative, there is likewise no resumptive
object pronoun, e.g.  (14) mo-t-ámr6t wúð hàd6x.} ‘Do whatever you say (= whatever you think
       best).’ (A8:17)When, on the other hand, an indefinite antecedent noun has a specific
referent and the following clause is non-restrictive, a pronominal object
suffix is used, e.g.  (15) q6m-xazéle xa-nàša} mì°a} naból6lle m†amòr6lle.} ‘He saw a dead person,
       whom they were taking to bury.’ (A17:1)
  (16) ""ína hóla xá-qay6m°a k°íwta tàma,} málka Šlémun k°ìw6lla.} ‘They found
       there an inscribed monument, which king Solomon had written.’
       (A14:55)
  (17) ""ítl6n xá-m6ndi b8y6x t-oð•xxe †làl6x.} ‘We have something (in mind)
       which we want to do for you.’ (A4:48)This distribution of resumptive pronominal suffixes can be interpreted
as reflecting the different syntactic status of restrictive and non-restric-
tive relative clauses. In restrictive clauses the head nominal, or at least
the relative particle D, is treated as the direct object of the verb in the
clause. Since indefinite objects in principle do not take object agreement
suffixes (§15.13.2.2.), there is no resumptive agreement suffix on the verb.
The occurrence of the pronominal suffix in non-restrictive clauses reflects
the fact that they have the status of independent clauses. Since, on the
other hand, definite direct objects in principle regularly co-occur with
pronominal agreement suffixes, this distinction in structure is not reflected
in the suffixes and the pronominal suffix occurs in both restrictive and
non-restrictive clauses.
   If the referent of the head nominal is the complement of a noun in the
relative clause, it is obligatorily represented by a resumptive pronoun, e.g.  (18) ""í°wa xa-""á©a gu-Bˆrw6r,} š•mme Raš‰d-bek.} ‘There was an agha in
       Barwar whose name was Rašid Bek.’ (B19:1)
  (19) ""áxtu kúll5xu ‘ìdetu} l-b7°6t màlka} t-íla Gozáli ""u-Nozáli gu-b6°-dìye.} ‘You
       are all invited to the house of the king, in whose house Gozali and
       Nozali are staying.’ (A8:89)
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                         973When the antecedent noun has the syntactic relation of an adverbial in
the relative clause that could be expressed without a preposition, there is
generally no pronominal resumption when the clause is restrictive. This
is the case with temporal adverbials (20–22) and the destination of verbs
of movement (23) (§14.13.):  (20) hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n} har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘Until the day I die,
       I shall always keep to God’s way.’ (A15:21)
  (21) ""7-g6t ""an-yomá°a t-awéwa ràba séra} . . . j>míwa kúlla ""ùrze,} jwànqe.} ‘On
       days when there was a lot of moonlight . . . all the men and young-
       sters gathered together.’ (B11:3)
  (22) hót m-ó-yom6 t-íx ""axni-zíle ""áti d•ry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘From the day that
       we went away you have held him in prison.’ (A26:76)
  (23) ku-b7°a t-àzeti} ""áni t-yawìlux} là †arðílux.} ‘Every home that you go
       to will give you something.’ (B7:7)If the role of the head in the relative clause would be normally expressed
by a locative preposition in an independent clause, the preposition is
sometimes still omitted when the clause is restrictive. This is found where
the locative role would be expected to be expressed by the preposition
gu-, b- or m6n-, e.g.  (24) hátxa xazêxwale} ku-dùk°a t-awéwa.} ‘We would see him wherever he
       could be.’ (B9:29)
  (25) xuláßa ""aláha mut•pq6lle gu-d-a-mðíta t-íla ""5-bráta d-o-màlka.} ‘In the
       end God made him come across the town where the daughter of
       that king was.’ (A4:11)
  (26) d6-púš làxxa} gu-d-ay-šwí°a t-wewa-dmíxa xòn6x.} ‘Stay here, in the bed
       in which your brother slept.’ (A8:68)
  (27) hon-d•ry6lle gu-xa-‘ále ""amúqta lá-""am6ß ‘ù-ga ‘ú-ga pal6†.} ‘I put him in
       a deep pit from which he could never come out.’ (A22:41)In some cases, however, the preposition is used in a restrictive relative
clause with a pronominal suffix resuming the head, e.g.  (28) ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux gáwa díya kúlla genàwela.} ‘(As for) the enclosure in
       which you threw it, they are all robbers.’ (A15:18)
  (29) m†éle gu-t8r6t ""ó-b5°a t-íla-wirta gàwe.} ‘He reached the door of the
       house in which she had entered.’ (A34:11)
974                           chapter nineteen  (30) ""ána ""ap-dìya} ""áyya ""úrxa t-ín ""ána zála bíya dìya} lè-y manš•nna hál
       yom6t-màw°a.} ‘I shall not give up until the day I die the way I am
       following now.’ (A21:35)If the clause is non-restrictive, a preposition with resumptive pronoun is
regularly used, e.g.  (31) ""í°wa xa-g•ppa gáwe díye ""àrbi hambišáye.} ‘There was a cave in which
       there were forty giants.’ (A24:54)A preposition is regularly used in all types of clauses if this is other than
the locative prepositions gu- or b-, e.g.  (32) d•ry5le ""an-b>†aníye xo°a-díya t-wewa-dmíxa Gozáli rèša.} ‘He placed
       under her the blankets that Gozali had slept on.’ (A8:69)A resumptive pronoun may be in a clause embedded within the relative
clause, e.g.  (33) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle bíya.}
       ‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards which
       I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)When the head nominal has the function of locative adverbial in the rela-
tive clause, it is occasionally resumed by the adverb tama, e.g.  (34) t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux d•ry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
       which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
  (35) wíð5le ""a-dúk°a nišànqa,} ""a-dúk°a t-wéwa ""o-dídwa wíra tàma.} ‘He made
       a sign in that place, the place where the fly had entered.’ (A11:10)When the head nominal of a relative clause is a predicate in a clause with a
1st or 2nd person subject and the referent of the head nominal is the sub-
ject of the relative clause, the verb of the relative clause is inflected in
the 1st or 2nd person, in agreement with the subject of the main clause,
e.g.  (36) ""ána ""o-xà qáša} t-ín ""•°ya gu-ˇiyàre.} ‘I am that priest who came to
       the ˇiyare.’ (B17:15)
  (37) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} ‘You have not become
       a good man who has brought these coins.’ (A1:26)

Indirect polar questions (i.e., yes⎯no questions) are asyndetic with no
explicit syntactic marker, e.g.  (1) xáz6x máß6t t-amr•tli módin x•zya b-xêlmi.} ‘Let’s see whether you can tell
      me what I saw in my dream.’ (A1:7)
  (2) xàz6n} màß6n} t-óð6n xa-‘àra.} ‘I shall see whether I can find a solution.’
      (A33:6)In (3) the indirect question is negated:  (3) xáz6x lá-mß6t mam†•tla ""i°á°ux hátxa ©ðàðe?} ‘Let’s see whether you can
      (literally: cannot) bring your hands together like this.’ (A28:15)If the indirect question consists of two alternatives, these may be presented
asyndetically (4–5) or the second alternative may be introduced by the
conditional particle ""6n (6), e.g.  (4) ""o-m•ndi la-ðíle sùsa-wewa} náša-wewa l-xàße.} ‘He did not know whe-
      ther that thing was a horse or whether there was a man on its back.’
      (A29:21)
  (5) ""áwwa táwr6t wála lán-ða""a módi ""•°ya bìye,} npíl5le b-""isàra,} ""awwa
      xà-m6ndile qí°a bíye.} ‘I don’t know what has happened to that wild
      ox, whether it has fallen on a rock or whether a thing such as that
      has happened to him.’ (A12:52)
  (6) l7la ðá""a módi bràya,} hadíya p7ša kèpa} ""•n la-p7ša kèpa.} ‘She did not know
      what was happening, whether she would now turn to stone or not
      turn to stone.’ (A8:73)In (7) the conditional particle introduces a second indirect question that
is an expansion of the first rather than an alternative:  (7) l7ð6n b-x9y6n} ""6n-b-d7‰6n t-xazênn6x.} ‘I do not know whether I shall
      live, whether I shall return and see you.’ (A8:56)The alternative question may be reduced to the negative particle la (la""a).
This is introduced by lo or ""6n, resulting in the forms lo-la and ""6lla (<
""6n-la), e.g.
976                            chapter nineteen  (8)   xáz6x mhayríli lo-là""a.} ‘Let’s see whether they will help me or not.’
        (A48:2)
  (9)   ""áw l7ðe ‘ádr6t bábe díyila ""êlla.} ‘He does not know whether it is his
        father’s tent or not.’ (A28:33)19.2.2. Questions Introduced by an Interrogative Particle
Various subordinate clauses that are introduced by interrogative particles
may be classified as indirect questions. These are embedded under verbs
such as ‘to know’, ‘to see’, ‘to show’, ‘to say’ and ‘to write’, e.g.  (1)  y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I put him?’ (A22:44)
  (2)  lá maxzátle ""•lli ""7ka pàl6†?} ‘Won’t you show me where it comes out?’
       (A24:38)
  (3) xáze mòdila q•ßß6t.} ‘He sees what the problem is.’ (A22:43)
  (4) làn-ða""a mo-qaríwale.} ‘I do not know what they called him.’ (A12:20)
  (5) ga-l7ð6x . . . ""7nila ""ùrxa.} ‘But we do not know . . . which is the road.’
       (A26:18)
  (6) ""ína ""ána léyð6n b-7ni dána t-à°e xúwwe.} ‘But I do not know at what
       time the snake will come.’ (A24:39)
  (7) síq5le l-b5°-qòra,} gu-qawrà°a,} xáze ""7nila qáwra xà°ta.} ‘He went down
       to the cemetery and among the graves he saw which (of them)
       was a new grave.’ (A25:89)
  (8) múr ""ˆni-m6nn6n} biš-šapìrt5la.} ‘Say which of us is the most beautiful.’
       (A25:17)
  (9) xzi-k6mà t-áz6l ""áwwa táwra.} ‘See how much this ox will go for.’ (A22:1)
  (10) b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""íman mˆ°ena.} ‘I want to know when I shall die.’ (A16:1)
  (11) l7la k°ìwe} ""ím6 t-íle bênya.} ‘They have not written when it was built.’
       (B6:31)If an indirect question clause that is introduced by an interrogative particle
contains a subject nominal or independent subject pronoun, this is often
placed before the particle, e.g.  (12) ""úp ""aláha la-y8ðe ""áti ""ìman m5°éti.} ‘Even God does not know when
       you will die.’ (A16:11)
  (13) ""áw xzèle ""o-dídwa ""7ka wìrre.} ‘He saw where the fly entered.’ (A11:9)
  (14) ""u-šákr6x š•mm6t márya ""álaha xáz6x ""úrxa ""ˆk5la.} ‘We shall pray to the
       Lord God that we may find where the road is.’ (A26:17)
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                            977  (15) ""6n-lá galêtli} róxux gu-mòdila} ""u-dáx-it xyà""a} ""ána xà-yoma k•slux la-p7š6n.}
       ‘If you do not reveal to me in what your spirit lies and how you
       live, I shall not stay with you a single day longer.’ (A12:40)The subject may be raised and made the object of the main verb. This
process is reflected by the pronominal object in (16) and (17) and the
object agreement pronoun in (18):  (16) ""an-š5r°†} láz6m y>ð•tla mòdila.} ‘You should know what these condi-
       tions are.’ (A24:10)
  (17) ""7ni ""ítl5xu t-náše t-máßi mšáw°i mênna} xaz7la mà†ola?} ‘What people
       do you have who can speak with her and find out how she is?’
       (A4:13)
  (18) t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla} xo-d-áwwa jùlla.} ‘He will come
       and will know what these are (Literally: what these are and are
       not) under this cloth.’ (A25:49)A constituent that does not have the role of subject is occasionally extra-
posed before the interrogative particle, e.g.  (19) yába t-áz6x xàz6x} ""5-brat7ni mà m•nna.} ‘Let’s go and see what has
       become of that daughter of ours.’ (A21:25)In (20) the embedded interrogative clause is introduced by the comple-
mentiser qa-t:  (20) xzéwali qa-t-""ó-f6lsa ""7ka npìlle.} ‘I saw where the coin fell.’ (B15:34)Interrogative particles are also used to express embedded exclamations, e.g.  (21) xzi-k6m7le lxìma!} ‘Look how fit he is!’ (A15:13)
  (22) xzi-""ánna yále k6mà š6†ránela!} ‘Look how beautiful the children are!’
       (A8:16)Some speakers have the practice of introducing new information that is
regarded as worthy of particular attention by an interrogative word, to
which the new information supplies the answer. This question and answer
structure may sometimes be blended together and put in the same into-
nation group, with the result that the whole construction is most easily
interpreted as an assertion, e.g.
978                           chapter nineteen  (23) ""áy y-ámri má dán6t plí†la qyàmta.} ‘What do they call this?—the time
       when the resurrection has come (= ‘They call this the time when
       the resurrection has come).’ (B5:54)We should mention here a few isolated cases in which the interrogative
particle ""5ni is idiomatically translated as an indefinite pronoun or a relative
particle. These appear to have arisen by a blend between an interrogative
and another construction, e.g.  (24) ""àna} kut-dax-t-íla bràti,} b8y6n ""ˆni m7°ela.} ‘Whatever has happened
       to my daughter, I want somebody to bring her back (I want—who
       will bring her back?).’ (A27:18)
  (25) škíra šêmmux,} márya ""àlaha,} ""7ni q6m-m5°éli láxxa bíyi b6-b-sùsi.} ‘May
       your name be praised, Lord God, who have brought me here
       together with my horse (who has brought me?).’ (A26:22)
                  19.3. Subordinate Content ClausesA variety of subordinate clauses that are embedded as components of
a higher clause will be brought together in this section under the broad
classification of ‘content clauses’. These function either as direct object
complements of a verb or are governed by clausal conjunctions consisting
of prepositions, adverbials and quantifiers. In a large proportion of cases
these subordinate clauses are introduced by the subordinating particle D,
though this is omitted in some circumstances. As is the case with relative
clauses, in this type of subordinate clause the enclitic copula is regularly
attached to the subordinating particle D at the front of the clause.","[1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1016, 1017]"
"17.1.1.3. Split Predicate
When the predicate is a composite phrase consisting of several constitu-
ents, the copula is sometimes placed on the head of the predicate before
the dependent elements.
  This is frequently the case when the head of the predicate is modified
by a dependent prepositional phrase, e.g.  (1)   ""áyya q7†5la †la-˙aywàne.} ‘This is (the activity of ) the summer for
        the animals.’ (B5:112)
  (2)   ""Ón-Núne npílt5la l-†úra l-†ùra.} ""“n-Nune lies between one mountain
        and another.’ (B5:148)
  (3)   har-blíg6t b-kàsux.} ‘You are always concerned about your stomach.’
        (A23:10)
  (4)   ""an-markáne mtúrßela m-""ùpra.} ‘The jars are made from clay.’
        (B5:168)
  (5)   ""aw-zeðáya mtúrß5wa m-xê††e.} ‘The flat-bread was made out of wheat.’
        (B5:15)
828                         chapter seventeen  (6)   ""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùl-naše.} ‘But it was higher than the
        villa of anybody (else).’ (B10:51)If the speaker wishes to give particular focal prominence to the dependent
prepositional phrase, this may be fronted before the head of the predicate
with the nuclear stress and copula placed on it, e.g.  (7)   ßáw°a gu-púmm6t màr5la š6klánta.} ‘A word is beautiful (only) in the
        mouth of its master (= It is easier said than done).’ (A26:40)The split of the predicate is regularly found when the head of the predicate
is a noun with a subordinate clause as its dependent, e.g.  (8)   dán5la qá-t d5r7la m5rˆ°a.} ‘It is time to add the rennet.’ (B5:164)It is occasionally found in nominal annexation constructions, whereby the
copula is placed on the head noun, e.g.  (9) ""ána málk6n d-ày-ba≥6r.} ‘I am the king of that town.’ (A32:9)
  (10) ""áwwa xa-nišànq5le} t-""á°‰a d-ˆ-ga.} ‘This was a symbolic act of our
       country at that time.’ (B5:153)In (9) the annexation particle is attached to a dependent phrase that begins
with a demonstrative and in (10) the particle is attached to a dependent
noun that is separated from its head by an intonation group boundary.
In both cases, therefore, the connection between the head and dependent
elements of the annexation are looser than in a construction in which the
annexation particle is suffixed to the head noun (k°aw6t qaša ‘the book of
the priest’). The copula does not split the head and dependent elements
in the latter type of tight annexation, e.g.  (11) ""ap-""ána brón6t màlk5w6n.} ‘I also am the son of a king.’ (A24:45)
  (12) ‘ál°6t qáša Hˆdot?} ‘Are you the daughter-in-law of the priest H5do?’
       (B9:10)A copula normally intervenes between a head noun and an adjective only
when the adjective is in a separate intonation group. In such constructions
the adjective can be regarded as a reduced form of a separate predication
(see §14.7., examples 47–50), e.g.
                                 the clause                                 829  (13) xa-kàrm5le} rába gò‰a.} ‘It is an orchard (which is) very large.’
       (A12:9)When the adjective occurs in the same intonation group as the head noun,
the copula is placed at the end of the phrase, e.g.  (14) ""ána xa-náša gò‰5w6n.} ‘I am an old man.’ (A8:43)
  (15) ""áy q6ßßètta rìxt5la.} ‘It is a long story.’ (A25:52)
  (16) xa-qèßß6t rába mapš6mànt5la.} ‘It is a very sad story.’ (A4:31)On some sporadic occasions the copula is placed on a quantifier or intensi-
fier particle that stands before the head of the predicate, e.g.  (17) ráb5wa náše xêðye.} ‘The people were very happy.’ (B15:12)
  (18) ráb6xwa xèðye pßìxe.} ‘We were very happy and cheerful.’ (B16:6)
  (19) t8r6t ""ùmra} ráb5wa kòpa.} ‘The door of the church was very low.’
       (B15:2)
  (20) kúlla qumašàt ""7-ga bíš-w5wa rešàye.} ‘All the material at that time was
       of the very best quality.’ (B10:45)This retraction of the copula can be regarded as a device for express-
ing the prominence of the intensifier particle. The predicate as a whole
expresses new information, so the particle is not being singled out as the
only information focus in the clause. This is reflected also in the prosody,
in that the nuclear stress is placed at the end of the predicate, which is
intended to mark the whole phrase as new information. Rather, within
the new information of the predicate, the intensifier is being given an
enhanced prominence. This can be compared to a construction with a
compound verbal form such as (21), in which the copula is moved back
onto the quantifier raba to give it an enhanced prominence within the
new information of the predicate:  (21) zríy6nwale b-i°à°i} ""u-ráb6nwa k‘íxa bíye dìye.} ‘I had cultivated it with
       my hands and greatly toiled in it.’ (A17:32)When the subject constituent is postposed, in some isolated cases it is placed
after the head noun of the predicate but before a dependent modifier.
This applies to (22), in which the independent subject pronoun intervenes
between a noun and its adjective. As with other cases of postposed subjects,
the clause has a status of a comment on what precedes it:
830                           chapter seventeen  (22) káze xoš-ßlìg6n} yalúnka ""áti zòr5w6t.} ‘He tried (to persuade him to go)
       “Go down, you are a young child.” ’ (A29:28)17.1.2. Independent Copula17.1.2.1. Basic Predicate
An independent standing copula without a subject constituent is attested
in the text corpus in two contexts.(i) Present Copula before the Predicate
These tend to occur as answers to rhetorical questions such as (1) and (2):  (1)   ""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèw6n.} ‘They put
        the yoghurt in a churn. What is a churn? It is an animal skin.’
        (B6:38)
  (2)   x7la díya mòdile} t-mazvêrra?} ""íla mìya.} ‘What is its power, which turns
        it? It is water.’ (B6:53)This type of question and answer structure has a similar function to
clauses with an independent copula after the subject such as guða ""ile g6ld6t
heyw6n, x5la diya ""ila miya (§17.1.2.2.), which typically supply an explanatory
or elaboratory comment on what precedes.(ii) Past Copula after the Predicate
These constructions do not appear to be significantly different in function
from corresponding ones with an enclitic copula. The ‘heavier’ coding
brought about by the prosodic separation may have been exploited by the
speaker to give the clause added prominence, e.g.  (1)   gu-bˆ°a wéwa.} ‘He was in the house.’ (A6:1)
  (2)   rába tàza ""iyéwa.} ‘It was very good.’ (B5:55)17.1.2.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
Clauses containing an independent standing copula generally have a
subject constituent in the form of an independent pronoun or a nominal.
The constructions discussed in §17.1.2.1. which lack a subject constituent
are far more rarely attested in the text corpus. The subject constituent is
regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate. The copula
is placed either before the predicate, immediately after the subject (1–6),
                                 the clause                                 831or is placed after the predicate (7–10). This applies both to the present
and the past copula.  (1)  ""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
  (2)  ""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
  (3)  ""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}
       ‘Here there is a drum. The drum is a box, with an open top, in
       which they put wheat.’ (B6:54)
  (4) b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
       Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
       (A26:55)
  (5) m6lxáwa ""íwa mtúrßa m-qˆsa.} ‘The winnowing fork was made from
       wood.’ (B5:87)
  (6) w-áw ""iwéwa malàxa.} ‘He was an angel.’ (A8:25)
  (7) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
  (8) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
  (9) sab-qyámta b-lˆle ""iyáwa.} ‘because Easter was at night.’ (B5:53)
  (10) tròßa} ""áni milàne ""iy7wa} ‘In fact, they were green.’ (B5:218)The placement of the copula immediately after the subject in clauses such
as (1)–(6) expresses the topical prominence of the subject. This reinforced
coding of the topic in initial position functions as a discourse boundary
marker. The construction is used either in statements that supply explana-
tory information concerning what precedes or in statements that open
a section of discourse. When acting as explanatory comments on what
precedes, they differ from constructions with postposed subjects such as
(§17.1.1.2., examples 18–24) in their degree of independence and promi-
nence. The postposed subject constructions are incidental comments that
are tagged onto what precedes. The constructions with the initial subject
and following copula are presented as important pieces of information,
which typically have relevance for what follows as well as being explana-
tory of what precedes.
   As remarked, the position of the copula after the subject expresses the
topical prominence of the subject. The prosodic detachment of the copula
as an independent word can be interpreted as a ‘heavy’ grammatical coding
device intended to give the clause as a whole prominence and distinctness.
Construction such as (7)–(10) which have have a prosodically independent
copula after the predicate exhibit this latter device. They can, therefore, be
regarded as expressing some degree of prominence. Indeed, they can all
be interpreted as being intended as important statements in the contexts
832                          chapter seventeenin which they occur. They lack the additional device of reinforcing the
topical prominence of the subject as a means of marking their distinct-
ness. It should be noted, however, that in the attested examples of this
construction a pronominal subject is always expressed by an independent
pronoun (cf. 7, 8, 10) rather than zero anaphora. This in itself is a ‘heavy’
coding device designed to mark a boundary (see §17.7.4.).
   The subject constituent in clauses with an independent copula is not
postposed after the predicate. This can be explained by the fact that, as
seen in §17.1.1.2, the postposition of a topic subject constituent, is typi-
cally used as a device to bind cohesively the clause with what precedes
as a form of incidental tag. This is incompatible with the function of the
independent copula as a marker of distinctness and independence from
what precedes. An apparent exception to this is (11):  (11) r6š-kúlla d-áni ""íla S6ttìye.} ‘Above all of these is S6ttiye.’ (A25:22)Here the inflection of the copula agrees with the noun S6ttiye and in this
respect the latter would normally be construed as the grammatical subject.
In terms of information structure, however, the initial prepositional phrase
containing the anaphoric pronoun is clearly more topical than the noun
S6ttiye, which is the asserted focus of new information.
   The initial subject constituent is sometimes separated from the rest of
the clause by an intonation group boundary. This is a further prosodic
device to reinforce the prominence of the initial topic in order to give the
clause as a whole distinctness in the discourse and disjoin it from what
precedes, e.g.  (12) ""u-zeðàya} ""íla biš-xlìmta.} ‘A flat-bread is thicker.’ (B6:49)
  (13) Nìnwe} ""iwáwa pét6xt ""a°oràye.} ‘Nineveh was the capital of the Assyr-
       ians.’ (B6:17)
  (14) M9mo} ""íwewa gu-""Al?n} ""u-Zìne} ""iwáwa gu-Jazíre Bòta.} ‘M>mo was in
       ""Alàn and Zine was in Jazire Bota.’ (A26:1)17.1.3. Deictic Copula17.1.3.1. Basic Predicate
When the deictic copula occurs in a clause without a subject constituent,
it is normally placed before the predicate (1–3).
                                 the clause                                 833  (1) hóla làxxa.} ‘They are here.’ (A14:100)
  (2) hóle gu-Kàrkuk.} ‘He is in Kirkuk.’ (A16:1)
  (3) hóla gwìrta.} ‘She is married.’ (A26:31)On sporadic occasions deviations from this structure are found. In (4)–(6),
for example, it is placed after the predicate. In (7) it is used in combina-
tion with an enclitic copula:  (4) bas-†lìya hóle.} ‘But he is asleep.’ (A31:6)
  (5) ""árye dìye} k6s-báxte dìye hóla.} ‘His lions are with his wife.’ (A18:19)
  (6) šxàna hóli!} ‘I am getting hot!’ (A32:23)
  (7) hóle qúrb6t nùr5le.} ‘He is near the fire.’ (A23:9)17.1.3.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
When the clause contains a subject constituent, the deictic copula is nor-
mally placed before the predicate. There is variation, however, regarding
the position of the subject, in that it may be placed before or after the
copula.(i) Subject—Copula
When the subject is placed before the copula, the clause in principle
marks some kind of discourse boundary. This construction often occurs
at the beginning of a section of text that concerns the referent of the
subject, e.g.  (1) xa-bráta hóla tàma} ""ána mèri ""êllux,} bráta zamàrt5la.} ""áp-xa l5le-
      mßáya bíya dìya.} ‘A girl is there. The girl is a singer—as I said to
      you. Nobody can prevail over her.’ (A25:68)
  (2) baxtá°6n hóla yaqúre t6rwê°na.} ""6n-báxtux mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxti
      mu°éla bròna,} brátux qa-bròni.} ""6n-báxti mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxtux mu°éla
      bròna,} ""a-bráti qa-brònux.} ‘Our wives are both pregnant. If your wife
      gives birth to a girl and my wife gives birth to boy, your daughter
      (will be married) to my son. If my wife gives birth to a daughter
      and your wife gives birth to a son, my daughter (will be married)
      to your son.’ (A25:2–3)
  (3) ""Ón-Nùne} hóla npílta gu-""á°‰6t Bêrw6r.} ""“n-Nune lies in the land of
      Barwar.’ (B4:1)The construction is sometimes used to introduce a discourse section that
is inserted within a larger section. This applies, for example, to (4), which
834                            chapter seventeenis an extract from a description of the activities of the bride in a wed-
ding. The construction in question with the deictic copula marks a shift
to a section concerned with the activities of the groom. The discourse
subsequent shifts attention back to the bride:  (4) y-amríla zawèrt6t k yàlo.} ""ày} ta-t-toràla} k yálo xaráye t-óra gu-bˆ°a.} maxyàle
      ""o-mèšxa.} xètna hóle zína l-gàre.} m6n-gáre maxé-""aqle r6š-swána
      hàtxa,} ßále xán‘i ""úpra gu-réš6t k yàlo.} xaráye t-àwra.} ‘They call it “the
      bride’s pot.” It was for the bride to break in order that she could
      finally enter the house. She would apply the oil, while the groom
      was standing on the roof. From the roof he strikes his foot on the
      eves like this and a little earth falls onto the head of the bride.
      Finally she enters.’ (B8:33–34)The inserted section may consist of only a clause, as in (5), in which the
speaker uses the construction to turn attention to the activity of the doves.
The effect is to present this as an activity with a degree of independence
from the activity of the youth described in what precedes, which is con-
comitant with it rather than being a component of it:  (5) xa-yála rába šapìra} hóle ""ê°ya,} súse mrúpy6lle gu-màrgax.} hóle dèry6lla gáne
      gu-bèrke dìyax.} hóle sxàya,} yoná°a hóla reše-reše-dìye.} mút ""áti tíwta
      làxxa?} qu-xzà!} ‘A very handsome youth has come and released his
      horse in your meadow. He has immersed himself in your pool and
      is swimming. Doves are (flying) over him. Why are you sitting here?
      Get up and see!’ (A25:58)The initial subject constituent is occasionally placed in a separate into-
nation group. This is the case in (6), in which the two clauses with the
deictic pronouns distinguish between the situation of his aunt and uncle
by presenting them in a contrastive opposition. The prosodic separation
of the subject topic constituent enhances the distinctness of the two poles
of the opposition:  (6) qìm5le,} šèmm6t má°a díye wéwa Barwòre.} ""ámte dìye} hóla gu-Sàrzar} ""u-xále
      dìye} hóle gu-Daštàne.} ‘The name of his village was Barwore. His aunt
      was in Sarzar and his uncle was in Daštane.’ (A23:1)(ii) Copula—Subject
When the subject constituent is placed after the copula, the clause is
presented with a greater cohesion with what precedes. In (1) and (2) the
                                     the clause                                     835construction gives descriptive detail concerning the preceding event. In
(3) it describes a situation that is an immediate consequence of the pre-
ceding event. In (4) the clause introduces the instrument of the following
activity of the cutting of the bread and in this sense is cohesive with what
follows. The placement of the subject after the copula, however, has the
effect of binding the whole section describing the cutting of the bread to
what precedes and presenting it as a direct consequence of it.  (1) wír5le gu-xà-""ot6x xéta} gò‰ta} hóla xákma kurs>wà°a} m-ày-gota}
      xákma m-ày-gota.} ‘He went into another room, a large one.
      Some chairs are on one side and some on the other.’ (A14:29)
  (2) ""áy hóla wáða kùbbe.} hóla ""i°á°a gu-lˆša,} lyáša kùbbe.} ‘She is making
      meat-balls. Her hands are in dough, while kneading the meat-balls.’
      (A21:26)
  (3) mú°y6lla làxxa} ""áw-u w9zìr} ""u-hóla wajjúwe díya làxxa.} ‘He and
      his vizier brought her here, and her effects are here.’ (A21:9)
  (4) zeðàye} t-la-qßàya} de-mà†o hóya?} hóla skínta mênne.} xarè†la zeðàye}
      b-pálga dìya.} ‘(He says) “Pitta bread without breaking it, how could
      that be?” He has a knife with him. He scores the pittas in their
      middle.’ (A30:21)17.1.4. Copula Clauses with an Interrogative Constituent
The predicate of a copula clause may be an interrogative constituent, e.g.
mòdile?} ‘What is it?’ (A4:48), ""ˆnile?} ‘Who is it’ (A22:32), ""ˆk5le?} ‘Where
is he?’ (A4:19).
   When the clause contains a subject constituent, the copula is always
placed on the predicate. The subject is placed either before or after the
predicate. The basic principle determining the position of the subject is
the same as in indicative clauses. The placement of the subject in initial
position before the predicate typically marks some kind of boundary in
the discourse, whereas the subject is postposed after the predicate when
the speaker wishes to present that clause as having greater cohesion with
what precedes.
   The construction with the subject before the predicate is frequently
attested in the text corpus at the beginning of a section of discourse that
supplies an explanatory comment on what precedes, e.g.  (1) hóle ""í°6n làxxa} stêrra.} stèrra mòdile?} xê††ele} ""u-šìšmele} ""u-pràge} ""u-sà‰e,}
      kúlla dèrye gu-mzìðe.} ‘There was a food store. What is a food store?
836                          chapter seventeen      It is wheat, sesame, millet, barley, everything put in leather bags.’
      (A23:17)
  (2) ""í°wal6n mandòrta.} mandórta mòdila?} ""áwwa kèp5le,} m6n-gòte,} m-ay-góta
      m-ay-gòta} xrí†a xa-bòya.} ‘We had a roller. What is a roller? It is a
      stone, bored with a hole in its side, on one side and the other side.’
      (B5:145)
  (3) ""éða gò‰a} yóm6t trùšeba} y-áwe duxràna.} y-áwe duxràna.} ""o-duxrána mòdile?}
      ""an-nàše} kùlla báte} kut-b7°a mbáš6l xa-mêndi.} ‘During the “big festival,”
      Monday was a (time of ) memorial, it was a (time of ) memorial.
      What is this memorial? The people, all the families, each family
      cooks something.’ (B5:64)The referent of the subject has not always been mentioned in the preceding
discourse. In (4), for example, the subject ‘his job’ has not been mentioned.
The crucial factor is that the narrator presents the interrogative clause as
a boundary, introducing a section of discourse in which he describes the
activities of his daily work:  (4) ""í°wale xa-tàwra} ""u-xa-xmàra.} kút-yum šúle díye mòdi-wewa?} šaqêlwale
      táwre díye} ""u-šaqêlwa xmáre díye} qèdamta} y-azèlwa z>rèwa} ""u-y-a°éwa
      l-bˆ°a,} y-axèlwa mèndi ""i-damêxwa.} ‘He had an ox and an ass. Every-
      day what was his job? He would take his ox and take his ass early
      in the morning and go to cultivate (his field). He would then come
      back home, eat something and go to sleep.’ (A21:3–4)The construction with the subject before the predicate is sometimes used
at the beginning of a speech turn, e.g.  (5) ""ám6r ""áw ""ˆnile?} ‘He says “Who is he?” ’ (A22:29)
  (6) ""ám6r ""áti ""ˆniw6t?} ‘He says “Who are you?” ’ (A28:34)When the subject is placed after the predicate, the nuclear stress is either
placed on the predicate or on the subject. As remarked above, the sub-
ject is postposed in various contexts where the clause is presented by the
speaker as cohesive with what precedes. In (7) and (8) the construction is
used in the second of a series of two questions, the purpose of which is
to elicit the same basic information and are presented as a unit:  (7) yába ""ˆk5le} Dáw6ð kòra?} ""7k5le ma˙álle dìye?} ‘Where is blind David?
      Where is his place?’ (A16:3)
                                  the clause                                 837  (8)   mère †la-Zàlo:} Zàlo} ""ánna mòdila gu-réšux,} ""ánna šaqyà°a?} módila ""ánna
        brinàne?} ‘He said to Zàl “Zàl, what these on your head, these scars?
        What are these wounds?” ’ (A29:4)In (9) the question ‘What was her name?’ is presented as cohering closely
with the preceding clauses which introduce the referent of a woman into
the discourse:  (9)   ""í°wa xa-baxtà} rába xàm°5wawa.} módi-wewa šèmma dìya?} B6lbèl Hazàr.}
        ‘There was a woman. She was very beautiful. What was her name?
        B6lb6l Hazar.’ (A8:21)In (10) the subject is postposed in a question at the beginning of a speech
turn. The effect of this is to present it as a tag to what precedes, eliciting
a supplementary detail, rather than setting it up as the onset of a new
section of discourse concerning ‘your house’:  (10) b-óma xéna ""á°eti †la-kawù°ra,} ‘íd6t k6slˆni.} mère ""ˆk5le b5°7xu?} mèra
       fèll6n dùk°a.} ‘(She said) “The day after tomorrow come to lunch,
       you are invited to our home.” He said “Where is your house?”
       She said “In such-and-such a place.’’ ’ (A22:14)If the interrogative constituent is the subject of the clause, this is normally
placed at the front of the clause with the copula cliticized to it, e.g.  (11) ""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Who is in the house?’
  (12) ""7nile zaqàra?} ‘Who is a weaver?’
  (13) módile r6š-mèz?} ‘What is on the table?’The nuclear stress is in principle put on the predicate. The placement of
the copula on the subject can be explained as a reflection of the topical
prominence of this constituent. It is not topically prominent in the sense
that it is referentially bound to the preceding discourse, but rather due
to the fact that it is the central concern of the clause which is typically
expected to be talked about in the following discourse. This may be termed
‘forward pointing’ topical prominence (see §15.4.1.4.1. iiia).
   The nuclear stress is generally placed on the interrogative subject
constituent when the predicate is a component of the presuppositional
background the clause. The prosodic pattern ""ˆnile gu-b7°a}, for example,
would typically be used when the speaker assumes that the hearer is
entertaining the presupposition that somebody is in the house.
838                          chapter seventeen   When an adverbial interrogative expression meaning ‘why’ is placed at
the front of a copula clause, the copula is, likewise, attached to this item
rather than to the predicate, e.g.  (14) ta-módila ""áyya mðíta hàtxa?} ‘Why is this town like this?’ (A4:31)17.1.5. Existential Usage
In a few cases the enclitic copula is used simply to predicate the existence
of a referent rather than ascribe some property to it or identify it with
another item. This is most commonly found in meteorological expres-
sions, e.g.  (1)   xapù°5la.} ‘It is foggy (literally: There is fog).’
  (2)   mê†r5la.} ‘It is rainy (literally: There is rain).’
  (3)   xêmm5le ""èlli.} ‘I am hot (literally: There is heat is to me).’
  (4)   qàr°5la ""èlli.} ‘I am cold (literally: There is cold is to me).’Other examples:  (5)   gu-xa-gèppa hambišàye-wawa.} ‘There were giants in a cave.’ (A12:18)
  (6)   há ríx6t náša naxrày5le!} ‘Ha, there is the smell of a foreign man!’
        (A24:47)
  (7)   ""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} ‘While there was flour on her hands,
        she opened the door.’ (A21:26)In principle the nuclear stress is placed on the existential subject in such
constructions, which reflects its status as a new information focus. In (8)
the copula is placed on a preceding quantifier. In such constructions the
whole clause is a new information focus, including the existential subjects,
which is reflected by the position of the nuclear stress on the subject at
the end of the intonation group. The placement of the copula on the
quantifier, therefore, does not express a narrow new information focus on
the quantifier, but rather expresses a prominence or intensification of the
quantifier within the broad information focus of the clause:  (8)   ""Ëšwu† rába krèt-iwa gu-""á°‰a.} ráb5wa tàlga} ráb5wa mè†ra ""u-m6ndiyàne.}
        ‘(The month of ) February was very bad in our country. There was
        a lot of snow. There was a lot of rain and so on.’ (B5:152)
                                 the clause                               839Sporadically the enclitic copula is found with an existential function with
referentially definite subjects in other contexts, e.g.  (9)   har-W7rda-w Nˆrgis-ila.} làtla,} lá bnòne,} lá ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘Only W5rda
        and N5rgis were there. They had no children, nothing.’ (A24:51)The independent copula is attested with existential meaning in clauses
contaning indefinite subjects, e.g.  (10) gu-d-ó qotíya ""íla xa-ßêpra.} ‘In that box there is a sparrow.’ (A12:40)The deictic copula is used existentially with definite or indefinite subject
constituents. It is placed either before or after the subject, e.g.  (11) hóla ""isèq°a dìya.} ‘Here is her ring.’ (A25:69)
  (12) hó""la mìya.} ‘Here is some water.’ (A28:18)
  (13) xa-b7°a hòle.} ‘There is a house over there.’ (A33:5)
            17.2. Clauses Containing a Negative CopulaThe negative copula is in principle placed before the predicate. The most
basic construction consists of a simple nexus of copula and predicate, e.g.  (1)   l7le dàwa.} ‘It is not gold.’ (A14:26)
  (2)   l7le póìla.} ‘It is not crooked.’ (A17:20)
  (3)   l7le gnàyi.} ‘Its not my fault.’ (A23:23)
  (4)   l7w6t d-áwwa ""à°‰a.} ‘You are not from this country.’ (A25:82)
  (5)   l7wa rába gò‰a.} ‘It was not very big.’ (B5:140)When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is generally placed
before the predicate, e.g.  (6) ""áwwa lˆle qáša.} ‘He is not a priest.’ (B17:7)
  (7) ""áw l7le ""ùpri.} ‘It is not my land.’ (A25:52)
  (8) Yuwán6s lˆle táma.} ‘Yuwan6s is not there.’ (A52:6)
  (9) dárdi l7la d-àyya.} ‘My suffering is not from this.’ (A26:66)
  (10) yèmmi l7wa qrì°a.} ‘My mother was not educated.’ (B8:15)
840                           chapter seventeenThe nuclear stress is placed either at the end of the predicate phrase or on
the copula. It is typically placed on the copula when the predicate consists
of an item that has been introduced in the preceding discourse, e.g.  (11) mère má-l6x bráta t-it-hátxa bxàya} qam-d-ánna ""êrwe?} mèra ""ánna lˆwa
       ""èrwe,} xon>wà°i w7wa.} ‘He said “What is the matter with you girl
       that you are weeping so much in front of these sheep?” She said
       “These used not to be sheep, they used to be my brothers.” ’
       (A34:20–21)
  (12) mère mùt kálba mubr7°a ""áti?} . . . mèra ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He
       said “What dog have you given birth to?” . . . She said “He is not
       a dog. You are a dog.” ’ (A11:20)
  (13) ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.} ""áwwa mì°5le.} ""áwwa mádam ""ì°wale} bàxta,}
       ""í°wale bnòne,} ""í°wale nàše,} ""áwwa lˆle mí°a.} ‘They say that he has
       no relatives. He is dead (in this case). So long as he had a wife,
       he had sons, he had relatives, he is not dead.’ (A17:17)The subject constituent is sporadically placed after the predicate. As with
positive copula clauses with postposed subjects, this construction is used
to express close cohesion to what precedes. It is found in contexts such
as (14), in which the clause is a comment that is presented as a tag to the
preceding remark and not the onset of a new discourse section. Note that
the subject is in a separate intonation group:  (14) hot-q†ìl6lle ""a≥vána!} mêre} lˆle ""a≥vána} ""àwwa.} (She said) “You have killed
       the caretaker.” ’. He said “He is not the caretaker.” ’ (A22:46)The negative copula is placed after the predicate in idiomatic interrogative
constructions such as (15) and (16). In these an interrogative clause with
a negative copula echoes a preceding interogative clause with a positive
copula, maintaining the same word order:  (15) dréla šláma l-f9qih} dàx-it?} dax-lˆw6t?} ‘She greeted the jurist “How
       are you? How are you not?” (A22:16)
  (16) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla.} ‘If he is my
       nephew, he will come and will know what these are and what they
       are not.’ (A25:49)
                                    the clause                                    841This echoing of the word order of a preceding constituent question with
a positive copula is also found in the answer to such questions, as in (17),
in which the negative copula in the answer is placed after the predicate:  (17) ""àm6r,} Fárxo †la-xále díye ""àm6r} xáli mòdila?} xáz6x ""askaràye.} kúlla ""Amedía
       píšla ""askaràye.} mère xá-m6ndi lˆla.} ‘He said, Farxo said to his maternal
       uncle “What is the matter uncle? We can see soldiers. The whole of
       Amedia has become soldiers.” He said “It is nothing.” ’ (A25:79)The 3fs. form of the negative copula l5la is tagged onto the end of clauses
in various contexts to refer to some general propositional content, e.g.  (18) b8z6xwa tannêkka.} tannèkka t-nù†a l7la?} ‘We would make a hole in
       the can, an oil can, is that not so?’ (B10:86)
  (19) kèma gàye} gu-xáßa díya mútte tópe ‘Æruk,} lˆla.} ‘Several times the guns
       were pointed at her back, bang, but it does not happen (i.e. the
       gun does not shoot).’ (B9:18)The negative particle la is occasionally used in a clause containing a posi-
tive copula in order to express asseveration rather than negation. In such
cases the negative particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.  (20) la-hóle mì°a.} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
  (21) la-""aw-d°s-wewa.} ‘He was indeed right.’ (A17:8)
  (22) la-málka màmi} hóle yèmya b-rèši.} ‘Indeed the king my uncle has sworn
       on my head (to execute me).’ (A25:36)
  (23) la-""àxxa-wewa.} ‘He was indeed here.’Such constructions have no doubt developed from the use of the negator
as an interjection to contradict some statement or request of the interlocu-
tor, as is seen in contexts such as (24):  (24) mère ßli-qàm°a} mère la-""àti ßli-qám°a.} ‘He said “Go down and
       meet her.” He (the other) said “No, you go down to meet her.” ’
       (A26:40)
842                          chapter seventeen                     17.3. The Existential ParticlesThe existential particles (""i°, ""i°wa, li°, li°wa and their variants) are placed
either before or after the nominal with which they are combined.","[866, 867, 868, 869, 870, 871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881]"
"  (16) A: ""7nile ""è°ya qedàmta?} B: ""è°y5le qedámta xòni.} ‘A: “Who has come
       this morning?” B: “My brother has come this morning.” ’
  (17) A: módit xèzya gu-bˆ°a?} B: xèzy5w6n gu-b7°a k°àwux.} ‘A: “What have
       you seen in the house?” B: “I have seen your book in the house.” ’This shows that narrow focus of new information alone does not neces-
sarily bring about a construction with leftward copula movement. Rather
it is used subjectively by the speaker to communicate information that is
not only new but that he wishes to present as worthy of particular atten-
tion. It is more regularly used in contrastive constructions such as (1)–(8),
where the speaker wishes to correct a misapprehension, than in responses
to constituent questions.
    It should also be noted that the leftward copula movement only occurs
when the focus is exhaustive, i.e. when the item in focus is unique for the
role in question. It is not used when the focused item constitutes one of
a list of items that perform the role, e.g.
                             the syntax of verbs                               681  (18) mère yèmmi ""7nile plìxa?} mèra bábi plíx5t ""àti,} ""u-xmára-w tàwra} ""u-""ána
       mtugbárt6n bˆ°a.} ‘He said “Mother, who has worked?” She said
       “My dear, you have worked, (also) the ass and the ox, and I have
       attended to the house.” ’ (A21:13)Observe that in the responses of (16) and (17) the copula that occurs with
the resultative participle is an enclitic rather than a deictic copula. This
reflects a tendency to use the enclitic copula in conversational discourse
when the verbal form is in the presupposition of the clause and is not
asserted. This is typically the case in responses to constituent questions
when the verb is repeated.
   The construction is sometimes used elsewhere in a more subjective
fashion, in places where the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to
an item, due to its unexpectedness or its importance in the context, e.g.  (19) b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Have you sent for me for this reason?’ (A21:35)
  (20) ""abàyele dèrya b-réša.} ‘He put his cloak over her.’ (A26:50)

       to a spirit-level.” ’ (A17:20)

       ping since they were wearing sheepskin shoes.’ (B19:7)
  (25) xòš-zuz6x wíðe.} ‘We have made good money.’ (A14:18)Constructions such as those in (19)–(25) are not making contrastive asser-
tions to correct a misapprehension nor are they responses to an explicit
constituent question. The section of the clause that is not in focus is not
strictly a presupposition, i.e. it is not necessarily assumed to be a proposi-
tion that is active in the mind of the hearer. It is part of the assertion of
the clause but with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused item.
Its lack of communicative pronominence relative to the focused item is a
682                          chapter fifteenproperty that it shares with presuppositional material. The basic function
of the leftward focus movement can, therefore, be identified as a means of
marking an enhancement of prominence on the item in question without
necessarily implying that the remainder of the clause is presuppositional.
In (19)–(22) the motivation for the construction is that the argument in
the clause is deemed by the speaker to be unexpected in the general situ-
ation described. In (23) it draws particular attention to the identity of the
person whom Qara Te≥din married, since this is the crucial point that
defines the term x6tna ‘brother-in-law’. Likewise in (24) the speaker gives
enhanced prominence to the ‘sheepskin shoes’ since these were the crucial
reason why the Christians did not slip and so were the key to their success.
In (25) prominence is given to an evaluative expression ‘good money’ in
order to enhance the degree of evaluation.
   Temporal adverbial expressions may be put into focus with the con-
struction in order to convey immediacy, e.g.  (26) bálki qam-xa-šàb°5le ""è°ya.} ‘He has come perhaps just a week ago.’
       (A8:56)The focusing of a gradable quantifier or intensifier with the leftward
copula movement conveys an enhanced degree, e.g.  (27) ""ána ràb5w6n plíxa gu-k7rma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
       orchard.’
  (28) ""áw hàdele bèrya.} ‘He has just been born.’In constructions such as (27) and (28) the elements that come after the
focus are not necessarily presuppositional, but may be part of the asser-
tion of the clause with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused
item. In such constructions with quantifiers and intensifiers the nuclear
stress is sometimes placed at the end of the intonation group rather than
on the item bearing the copula, e.g.  (29) ""ána ráb5w6n plíxa gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
       orchard.’
  (30) yóma hádele zrìqa.} ‘The sun has just now risen.’ (A26:37)
  (31) xúwwe ""áx‘ile múdwa rìqa.} ‘The snake just managed to escape.’
       (A1:15)In constructions such as (29)–(31) the material after the item bearing the
copula is part of the assertion. These examples show that the copula and
                            the syntax of verbs                            683the nuclear stress placement may operate independently in the marking
of prominence. The nuclear stress is in the default position at the end of
the intonation group and signals that the predicate as a whole is asserted
new information. The copula is used to give particular prominence to one
item in this assertion. In such constructions the copula marks a weaker
level of prominence than when it is combined with the nuclear stress. The
item with the copula is, nevertheless, given more prominence than when
there is no leftward copula movement at all, as in (32).  (32) ""ána rába plíx5w6n gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
       orchard.’Conversely the nuclear stress is occasionally moved forward to give par-
ticular prominence within the intonation group without the copula moving
from its default position, e.g.  (33) xzáy6t-6lle ""áwwa qàßra?} kúlle b-qarqupyà°a bèny5le.} ‘Do you see this
       palace? It is all built of skulls.’ (A24:51)(ii) Topically Prominent Constituent
A leftward moving copula may also be attached to a topically prominent
constituent. A constituent with topical prominence has a referent that has
been mentioned in the immediately prior discourse, with the result that
it is not only assumed to be familiar to the hearer but also activated in
his consciousness. It serves as the topic of the clause. Unlike an item in
focus, the topic is not part of the assertion of the clause, rather it is the
remainder of the clause that is asserted and that conveys new information
about this topic.
    Topical items with a leftward moving copula do not bear the nuclear
stress. They are, therefore, given a weaker level of prominence than focused
items that have both the copula and the nuclear stress.
    Not all items that serve as a clause topic have the leftward moving
copula attached to them. This construction is restricted to topics that
the speaker wishes to give particular prominence. One context in which
the construction is attested is where the item has been activated in the
immediately preceding discourse and is repeated in consecutive clauses.
This is the case in (1) and (2), in which the second occurrence of the item
in question has a copula attached to it:  (1)   ""áti rába wíð6t spayù°a} ""u-""átit pqiðêll6n.} ‘You did a lot of good and
        you instructed us.’ (A8:87)
684                               chapter fifteen  (2) mátti táxta hàtxa} ta-t-""àzi,} lí°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} táxt5la mútte hàtxa}
      ta-ßáli tàma.} ‘They placed a board like this, so that they could go
      (there)—there are no steps—so that they can go down to the base-
      ment. They placed a board like this, so that they could go down
      there.’ (A22:10)These constituents are anaphorically bound to the immediately preced-
ing discourse and function as the informational starting point, i.e. topic,
of the ensuing propositions. These can be regarded as two aspects of a
broader notion of topic as a current item of concern in the discourse. The
constituents would have this status even if they did not have the copula
enclitic. The copula gives added coding, which enhances the prominence
of this status. This ‘heavy’ coding of the clause initial topic is often used
as a strategy to signal a boundary in the discourse. The purpose of sig-
nalling the boundary may be to mark the clause off distinctly from what
precedes in order to give prominence to the content of the clause, which
appears to be the motivation in (1) and (2). In (3) the strategy of bound-
ary marking is used to mark a clear opposition between the actions of
the subject referents in two adjacent clauses:  (3) mbàdla,} qyàm5la,} kúlla b8yi t-àzi,} ""áww5le dmìxa Barzèkko.} ‘In the
      morning they got up and all wanted to go, but he, Barz6kko, was
      asleep.’ (A12:8)The construction may also be used to give topical prominence to the
anaphoric element hatxa ‘thus’, which refers back to a situation in the
preceding discourse. In (4) the purpose is to set the two clauses apart and
present them as expressing separate events:  (4) hátx6n wíða be-xàli,} hátx6n wíða be-""àmti} ‘I did such-and-such in the
      house of my uncle, I did such-and-such in the house of my aunt.’
      (A23:40)(iii) Other cases of leftward movement
It is necessary to distinguish some other categories of construction which
exhibit leftward movement of the copula enclitic. These include interroga-
tive constituents, adverbials and certain subordinating particles.(a) Interrogative constituents
The copula element of the resultative is generally attached to inter-
rogative constituents. In some cases the interrogative constituent bears
                           the syntax of verbs                          685the nuclear stress and it can be classified as the expression of a type of
narrow focus. The remainder of the clause is presuppositional and the
focus is put on the interrogative item. Unlike assertive clauses, however,
the identity of the interrogative item is not being asserted but rather
questioned. Examples:  (1)   ""ˆnile plíxa ""èdyo?} ‘Who has worked today?’ (A21:15)
  (2)   ""ˆnile q†íl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A28:7)
  (3)   mòdit wíða?} ‘What have you done?’ (A23:34)
  (4)   yóm6 tré ""ˆk5tu dmíxe?} ‘Where did you sleep on the second day?’
        (A12:19)
  (5)   m-ˆk6t ""è°ya láxxa} ""u-dàx-it ""è°ya?} ‘From where have you come here
        and how have you come?’ (A14:33)
  (6)   dàx-it xíla kúlla?!} ‘How have you eaten all of it?!’ (A2:11)Such constructions are analogous to interrogative clauses such as (7) and
(8) in which the question concerns one constituent:  (7)   ""àtit q†íl6lle xúwwe?} ‘Was it you who killed the snake?’ (A24:45)
  (8)   ""àtit mú°y6lle †7ri?} ‘Was it you who brought back my bird?’ (A24:32)In many cases, however, the nuclear stress is placed on the final word of
the intonation group rather than on the interrogative constituent, e.g.  (9) ""7nile plìxa?} ‘Who has worked?’ (A21:13)
  (10) ""7nile q†ìl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)
  (11) m8nile mèßya z6dy6lléy laxxàne?} ‘Who could have thrown them here?’
       (A8:15)
  (12) módit xèzya qam-ˆnux?} módit xêzya?} ‘What have you seen before your
       eyes? What have you seen?’ (A24:31)
  (13) módin xèzya b-xêlmi?} ‘What have I seen in my dream?’ (A1:14)
  (14) ""7ni báxt5la mubrˆ°a?} ‘Which woman has given birth?’ (A25:6)
  (15) †la-módit ""è°ya dmìxa} gu-šwì°i?} ‘Why have you come to sleep in my
       bed?’ (A26:3)
  (16) ""u-lé-y-y>ð6n m-7k6t ""ê°ya.} ‘And I do not know from where you have
       come.’ (A14:76)
  (17) y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I have put him?’ (A22:44)Such constructions, in which the nuclear stress is not on the interrogative
constituent, have a different information structure, in that the question
686                           chapter fifteenis not focused exclusively on the interrogative constituent but rather on
the proposition as a whole. The attachment of the copula enclitic to the
interrogative constituent, therefore, cannot be motivated by its being in
narrow focus. The interrogative constituent, nevertheless, is what the
question primarily requests information about and so is given prominence
by the copula, but this is a weaker level of relative prominence than
constructions in which the constituent is marked both by the copula and
by the nuclear stress.(b) Adverbials
Narrow focus is sometimes given to an anaphoric adverbial by attach-
ing the copula to it and giving it the nuclear stress. As in some of the
examples of narrow focus on nominals cited above, the remainder of the
clause is not always necessarily a presupposition. The purpose of giving
the adverbial a high degree of prominence is to enhance its anaphoric
function and bind it closely with what precedes, e.g.  (1) mutt7°6lle púmma gu-pùmm6t} Fàrxo,} šuréla myàßa} ""ˆ-dan5la kèlye.} ‘She
      put her mouth on the mouth of Farxo and began sucking. At that
      time they stopped (crying).’ (A25:5)
  (2) †alána yá'ni †alàna,} sab-šèmša ""7-g6t maxyàwa} †uráne ""àtx5na wíye.} ‘(The
      word) †alana means “shady”, since when the sun rose, the mountains
      became like that (i.e. became shady).’ (B3:2)
  (3) bábi muttúle táma bˆ°a.} zìll5ni,} t6xrú°a dìyi} ""u-t-xóni d-o-gò‰a.} ""áwwa
      xóni tàm5le bèrya.} ‘My father set up home there. We went, as far as
      I remember, together with my older brother. This brother of mine
      was born there’. (B8:10)In (4) this device of enhancing the force of the anaphoric binding of the
adverbial is used in a clause that has the status of a relative clause. The
effect is to bind the clause clearly to the preceding head noun:  (4) ""5-dúk°6t m>m6ðìwal6n,} ""ax-xa-bányo zòra,} ""átxa gu-""úpra nqìra,} kúll6n
      tàm5w6x m5mèðe t-íw6x bèrye}—""áw6n pìš5wa.} ‘The place in which they
      used to baptize us, like a small bath, dug into the earth, where all
      of us who were born were baptized—that has survived.’ (B3:20)An adverbial that does not bear the nuclear stress may have the copula
attached to it, as in (5), where the copula is moved leftwards onto the tem-
                            the syntax of verbs                              687poral adverbial in the clause ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme}. This may be regarded as
a type of topical prominence, which is a weaker level of prominence than
the prominence expressed by both the copula and the nuclear stress. The
effect, as is generally the case with clauses with initial topically prominent
items, is to signal a boundary in the discourse. Although the initial item
is anaphorically bound to what precedes, its status as a communicative
starting point is enhanced. This is the case here, in which the clause in
question offers a piece of incidental information about the general histori-
cal situation, which is not directly connected to the event of the wedding
discussed in what precedes. This should be contrasted with the function
of the construction occurring earlier in the passage ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni
Šèmmo}, in which the adverbial is given a stronger degree of prominence by
both copula movement (in this case a past copula) and by nuclear stress.
The speaker intends this clause to be bound closely with what precedes,
since it relates directly to the wedding.  (5) taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo} ""7-g6 t-w7wa ríqe nàše} ßèlye Bad5rêške,}
      ""áskar t-léwi síqta gu-""Ón-Nùne,} ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni Šèmmo.} ""6ngl6znàye}
      ""áskar-t léwi tàxr6n.} ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme,} gu-Tùrki músqe.} ‘I remember
      the wedding of my brother Š6mmo, when people had fled and
      come down to Bad5r6ške. The Levy army went up to ""“n-Nune. It
      was then that Š6mmo married. I remember the English, the Levy
      army. At that time the borders were moved, they were moved up
      to Turkey.’ (B9:21)A similar strategy is exhibited by (6)–(8). Here the adverbs with an enclitic
copula but without the nuclear stress are linked correlatively to the fol-
lowing clause rather than being bound to what precedes. In (6) the fol-
lowing clause specifies the content of the adverb. Examples (7) and (8)
are adversative constructions. The initial adverbials set up an expectation
that is reversed in the second clause:  (6) bróni hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye.} ‘My son, the situa-
      tion is like this. The king has brought his daughter.’ (A21:8)
  (7) zíl5le †8ya bràtux.} hád6x-ile wìða,} bás lˆle xèzy6lla.} ‘He went to look
      for your daughter. He acted thus, but did not find her.’
  (8) k6má-gay6x tíwe m-©ðàðe,} har-lán mêßya ""axwá°e dìye.} ‘However many
      times we have sat together, I still cannot be like him.’ (A25:44)
688                            chapter fifteen(c) Subordinating Conjunctions
In subordinate clauses opening with the general subordinating conjuction
D or the conditional particle ""6n the copula is attached to the conjunction
at the front of the clause.
   The subordinating conjunction D may serve as the head of a relative
clause (1–3) or the subordinative operator of other types of clause, e.g.  (1)   mqawòl5w6n,} ""ap-""an-zúze kúlla t-in šqìl6lla} p>lènna pàlge.} ‘I promise,
        I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)
  (2)   la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a.} ‘I do
        not want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed
        has died.’ (A4:33)
  (3)   t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux dèry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
        which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
  (4)   ""áx-t-it-""áti šêtya,} ""áp-""aw hàd6x.} ‘As you have drunk, he also (has
        been treated) in the same way.’ (A26:33)
  (5)   dáx t-in-mu°7°6lla ""a-béna xèta,} ""ay-béna ""àna ma°yánna.} ‘Just as I
        brought her before, so this time I shall bring her.’ (A27:30)
  (6)   ""ím6 t-íla mú°y6lla ""a-bráta ""èlle dìye,} mbùrx6lla.} ‘When they brought
        that girl to him, they wedded her (to him).’ (A16:6)
  (7)   xá-xeta qímela zìlela,} ha-t-íla zíle óêmy5le.} ‘They went (to help) once
        again, but by the time they had gone, it was put out.’ (A48:4)
  (8)   l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
        (A17:2)On many occasions the copula bears the nuclear stress of the intonation
group, e.g.  (9)  ""u-dí‰5le ßèly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na,} ""5-""7na t-ìle ""è°ya qamáye réša.} ‘He went
       back down to the spring, the spring to which he had come previ-
       ously.’ (A26:32)
  (10) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ‘The day that he went out, his
       son died.’ (A4:32)
  (11) ""ánna dax-t-ìla zíle,} M8mo dèry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘When they had gone,
       they put M>mo in jail.’ (A26:74)
  (12) ""ax-t-ìle wíra,} ""í°wa dúk°a ta-t-kalèwa.} ‘When he entered, there was
       space for him to stand.’ (A22:30)The placement of the copula on the subordinate particle in relative clauses
can be related to the use of leftward copula movement to mark topically
                              the syntax of verbs                               689prominent items. The referent represented by the D particle, which is that
of the antecedent noun in the adjacent main clause, is clearly the main
topical concern of the relative clause. Although such copula movement
to mark topical prominence is an optional strategy in main clauses, it has
been formalized as a fixed rule in subordinate relative clauses. It would
appear that this was further generalized to other types of subordinate
clause opening with the particle D.
   Examples of leftward movement of the copula in protasis clauses open-
ing with ""6n:  (13) ""èn-in ""àna ""è°ya gu-šwí°6x,} qr7g6n xaddàm6x.} ‘If I have come to sleep
       in you bed, call your servants.’ (A26:4)
  (14) ""6n-it ""è°ya šúl6t qa˙bù°a,} k6s-báb6n B9ku.} ‘If you have come to for-
       nicate, then (lodge) with our father B>ku.’ (A26:26)The movement of the copula onto the conditional particle ""6n is likely to
have arisen from the fact that the particle was originally followed by D,
as is still the case in some NENA dialects.","[719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728]"
"  (13) A: ""7nile ""è°ya qedàmta?} B: xònile ""è°ya qedámta.} ‘A: “Who has come
       this morning?” B: “My brother has come this morning.” ’
  (14) A: módit xèzya gu-bˆ°a?} B: k°àwux-in xèzya gu-b7°a.} ‘A: “What have
       you seen in the house?” B: “I have seen your book in the house.” ’Example from the text corpus:  (15) ""ánna zmaryá°a m-ˆk6t lípt6lla?} biš-basímela m->nàha.} ""ána gu-Hàlmun-in
       lípt6lla.} ‘ “Where did you learn these songs from? They are more
       beautiful than the others.” “I learnt them in Halmun.” ’ (A35:9)The presuppositional background of the questions in (13) and (14) is ‘x has
come this morning’ and ‘You have seen x in the house’ respectively. The
response to such questions concerning a particular argument, however,
may also be expressed without fronting of the item in focus and leftward
movement of the copula. An alternative type of response would put the
item in focus at the end of the clause with the nuclear stress, e.g.",[719]

                                PREFACE
The complete destruction of the villages of Barwar in northern Iraq in
1988 brought to an end the world of an Assyrian Christian community
that spoke a dialect of neo-Aramaic. The dispersal of the villagers to the
Iraqi towns and to a diaspora outside Iraq has considerably threatened
the survival of their dialect. Many of its distinctive morphological features
and numerous items of vocabulary relating to the traditional agricultural
life of the community are in danger of being lost. Also endangered is the
rich tradition of oral folklore that existed in the community in former
times but, for the most part, is now falling into oblivion.
    Over the last five years I have worked with informants who grew up and
lived in the villages. In this book I attempt to capture the world of their
community as they knew it in former times. It has been my privilege to
have met some of the oldest surviving members of this community who
still remember well their neo-Aramaic dialect and the oral folkloric tradi-
tions. On the basis of the material gathered from numerous fieldtrips, I
present here a detailed linguistic description of their dialect, an extensive
corpus of transcribed recordings and a glossary of lexical items.
    I should like to express thanks to all my informants without whose
kind collaboration this work could never have been undertaken. These

"15.5.3. Cognate Infinitive
On some occasions a finite verb is combined with an infinitive from the
same root and stem. Such infinitives are placed either before or after the
verb. The general purpose of this construction is to give prominence to
the verbal predicate. It is found in a variety of different contexts.
   The verbal predicate is sometimes given prominence in order to set it
in contrastive opposition to a situation mentioned in the adjacent context,
e.g.  (1) ""áwwa b7°a x>làla-wewa} bás ""áyya †ása dàwa} gnàwa-wawa gnúta.} ‘That
      house was pure, but the bowl had been stolen.’ (A15:18)
  (2) kusì°a,} har-""àm‰a-wewa,} gamríwa gmàra.} ‘A hat was only wool. They
      pressed it (they did not knit it).’ (B10:50)
  (3) ""ína bróna lˆla xílt6lle.} har-nobált6lle mutt7°6lle mattòye.} ‘But she did not
      eat the boy. She had just taken him and put him down.’ (A19:7)
  (4) b-q7†a lá-mß6x doqêxle,} ""6lla-q†ála qa†lìwa náše.} ‘In summer we could
      not catch them, but rather people would kill them.’ (B5:147)The construction is used when the situation described is deemed by the
speaker to be unexpected in the context, e.g.  (5) ""ap-q†ála b>yènwa qa†lênwale.} ‘I even wanted to to kill him.’ (A1:17)
  (6) ""7-ga lánwa brì°a ""ána bráya.} ‘At that time I was not even born.’
      (B8:5)
  (7) práxa prìxle?} ‘Has he flown away?’ (B9:6)In many cases the cognate infinitive is used with a verb denoting an action
that has particular importance. This is often reflected also by the repetition
of the verb within the section of discourse in question, e.g.
                              the syntax of verbs                                  731  (8)  ""áyya y-amríla mandòrta,} yá'ni mandrále gàre} . . . qa-t-lá-ßala dalòpe.}
       ""u-b-sêtwa} ""í°ena ""íma t-y-á°e ""6ryàna} ""áy mandòre mánd6ri.} ‘They call
       this a roller, that is it rolls the roof . . . so that leaking water does
       seep down (into the house). In the winter, when it rains, they would
       roll it.’ (B5:193–194)
  (9) qayèmwa báb6t xêtna,} dawèqwala ""íð6 báb6 k yàlo.} ya'ni dwáqa dawèqwa
       ""íð6-dìye} qá-t ""ó-m6ndi wèle.} ‘The father of the groom would rise
       and shake the hand of the father of the bride. He would shake
       his hand (to confirm) that this has taken place.’ (B5:10)
  (10) tre-šabbá°a qam-dána ‘ˆdi.} y-ázi ma°wà°a,} ‘yàda ‘5díwa.} ‘Two weeks
       beforehand they would invite (people). They would go to the vil-
       lages and make invitations.’ (B5:20)
  (11) har-t-ór6n làxxa.} q†ála har-qa†lìli.} t-árq6n b-o-k6ndála hár qa†lìli.} ‘I shall
       go in here. They will kill me. If I run down the slope, they will
       kill me.’ (B9:4)The construction is used as an intensifier to express the extensive or far-
reaching nature of the action, e.g.  (12) ""ána zála har-zíl6n bìya} ‘I have absolutely gone with it! (i.e. I am
       finished!)’ (A14:25)
  (13) ma†réwa ma†róye x5làna.} ‘He was riding hard.’ (A8:39)In (14) it is used to express the slow drawing out of the action:  (14) šqílta réše mattóye mtút6lle l-9ra.} ‘She took his head and slowly put it
       on the ground.’ (A13:12)In (15) and (16) the cognate infinitive is used to give prominence to the
descriptive content of the action of the verb:  (15) kút-xa y-amrèxxe yá'ni ""6n-íle náša spày,} ""ó-yoma basímta t-óya šêmša.}
       xàðexi.} ""ó-yoma hàtxa yá'ni} y-amrèxla màra.} ‘We would say to each
       person, if he was a good man, that on that day the sun will shine.
       We were having fun. It was like that on that day, we would just
       say such things (but not really mean it).’ (B5:150–151)
  (16) ""áy lˆwa zwána zwán6lla.} ‘They were not really buying it.’ (B15:68)
732                            chapter fifteenIn (17) the construction is used to make a forceful assertion to dispel the
doubt of a question posed by the interlocutor:  (17) zaqrituwa? zqára ""i-zaqrèxwa ""àxni,} hè.} ‘Did you knit? We indeed used
       to knit, yes.’ (B10:46)In the foregoing examples the cognate infinitive is the same stem as the
finite verb. In (18), by contrast, a stem I infinitive is combined with a stem
II verb. The stem II verb (m-brz ‘to dry’) is transitive whereas the stem I
form (brz I ‘to become dry’) is intransitive. The infinitive, therefore, does
not simply intensify the verb but expresses a telic outcome ‘they dry the
rice so that it becomes dry’, i.e. ‘they dried the rice out’:  (18) bar-hád6x rèzza mbárzi bràza.} masqíwale gàre,} masqíwa gàr-t bˆ°a.}
       mpa°ˆwale.} barèzwa tàza.} ‘After that they dry the rice out. They
       would take it up to the roof, take it up to the roof of the house.
       They spread it out. It became thoroughly dry.’ (B5:88)15.5.4. Purpose
On some occasions an infinitive is used to extend the description of an
action in a preceding clause by denoting the purpose of the action rather
than an action that actually takes place during its time interval. This is
particularly common after verbs expressing movement, taking and fetch-
ing, e.g.","[769, 770, 771]"
"14.9.11.1. Modifier of a Noun
When functioning as a modifier of a noun, the word is always placed after
the noun. A singular indefinite noun in such phrases generally has the
                          the syntax of nominals                           547indefinite cardinal particle xa/ða ‘a, one’ and definite nouns singular and
plural have demonstratives. The word means ‘other’, both in the sense
of ‘different, alternative’ and also that of ‘additional’:  (1)   mattúli xá-š6mma xèna.} ‘Give me another name.’ (A7:2)
  (2)   m-ya-góta xèta} ‘from the other side’ (A25:30)
  (3)   ""áwwa plí†5le gu-ða-dúnye xèta.} ‘He came out in another world.’
        (A14:26)
  (4)   w-an-xon>wá°a xéne mèra ‘the other brothers said . . .’ (A12:17)
  (5)   ða-kista-xéta max-d-áy yawênn6x.} ‘I shall give you another bag like
        that one.’ (A4:16)
  (6)   xa-béna xéta mjarbênna.} ‘I shall test them another time (= again).’
        (A48:4)The particle ‘u- may replace xa/ða before negated indefinite nouns:  (7)   ‘ú-mdi xéna lì°6n.} ‘There is nothing else.’ (A4:43)An indefinite singular noun does not have any preceding particle if it is
a noun of mass: tálga xèna} ‘more snow’, mèndi xéna kúlla ‘all else’ (A21:14).
Elsewhere an indefinite singular noun rarely lacks the preceding particle.
The attested examples are listing constructions, expressing one of several
items in a list rather than one that is in binary opposition to another item
(8) or adverbial phrases (9), e.g.  (8)   qímle ""áqla xéta . . . q6m-parêmla.} ‘He cut off another leg (one of the
        four).’ (A22:5)
  (9)   zílle ""u-xyèle gu-mðíta xéta.} ‘He went and lived in another town.’
        (A18:11)The head of the phrase may be an interrogative pronoun: módi xèna?}
‘What else?’ (A23:35), ""7ni xèna?} ‘Who else?’
   Indefinite plural nouns may have the indefinite determiner xakma ‘some,
a few’ or a numeral: xákma šènne xène} ‘a few more years’ (B5:208), trè-m6ndi-
yane xéne} ‘two other things’ (A39:8), ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ‘ten other people from
  iyare’ (B17:16), ""6ští-š6nne xène} ‘sixty more years’ (A4:48). It is, however,
often left without any determiner:  (10) ""o-táj6r núbl5le náše xène.} ‘The merchant brought other people.’
       (A14:72)
548                          chapter fourteenAn adjective is placed after the particle if the adjective is presented as
specific to the item in question:  (11) xzéli xa-b7°a xéna zòra.} ‘I saw another house, (which was) small.’
  (12) xàr°a} t-á°e xá-""eða xréna zòra.} ‘Then comes another festival, (which
       is) small’ (B6:8)If the adjective expresses a property that is common to the set of which
the noun in question is one member, the particle xena is placed after the
adjective:  (13) xzéli xa-b7°a zóra xèna.} ‘I saw another small house (another one of
       the set of small houses).’The noun may be omitted with the singular indefinite particle xa/ða or a
demonstrative alone functioning as the head of the phrase: xa-xéna ‘another
one’ (A23:27), ða-xéta ‘another one’ (A22:9), ""o-xéna ‘the other one’ (A4:45),
""áyya xéta ‘this other one’ (B12:2), ""an-xéne ‘the others’ (A8:86). The singular
indefinite particle is occasionally omitted in contexts where the item is
presented as one of a list of members of a set:  (14) qayèmwa xéna t-amêrwa} ‘Another man (from the group) would get
       up and say . . .’ (B5:9)
  (15) ""áy y-oya-prìqta,} mátta xéta šópa dìya.} ‘(When) that is finished, she
       puts in another in its place.’ (B5:102).","[585, 586, 587]"
"17.8.1.2. Resumptive Element
The extraposed constituent is generally resumed in the clause by a
pronominal suffix. The suffix may be on the verb (1), a noun (2) or a
preposition (3):  (1) ""áw y-amríle xêppo.} ‘That—they call it a x6ppo.’ (B5:35)
  (2) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
      wood.’ (A12:39)
  (3) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome.} ‘In our commuity a week is seven
      days.’ (A17:13)In some cases the resumptive element is an independent pronoun. In most
of the attested cases this is the subject of the clause, e.g.  (4) jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘The chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)
  (5) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse} ‘But a ladder—it is (made) of wood.’ (B10:60)
  (6) bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Only my eye, which saw
      it—let that go to Hell.’ (A16:2)
  (7) ""o-t-íle plíxa ""àw bt-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has worked—he will eat.’ (A21:15)Occasionally the independent resumptive pronoun is the object of the
verb, e.g.  (8) táma ""áti kut-b8y6t gór6t ""àw.} ‘There anybody you like—you can marry
      him (= You can marry anybody you like).’ (A8:80)
  (9) ""í° pál†a zùrta.} ""5-zúrta ""áy zadìwala.} ‘There was (some of the tobacco)
      that came out (as) small (pieces). This small stuff—they threw that
      away.’ (B7:17)
898                          chapter seventeenThe resumptive element may even be a full nominal, e.g.  (10) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘As for the mullah, the cooking pot
       became the mullah’s.’ (A5:10)In (11) where the extraposed element is a generic relative phrase, the
resumptive noun has an anaphoric demonstrative pronoun:  (11) kú nêšma} t-mà†ya} r6š-gèšr6t Dalàle} ""5-nèšma b6d-pˆša} prìmta,} q†ìlta.}
       ‘Any soul that comes onto the bridge of Dalale—that soul will be
       slaughtered, killed.’ (C8:5)In (12) an extraposed plural noun does not have any direct resumption,
but is linked to a singular noun in the clause in a set relationship:  (12) bàte} ""áxni qáßra díy6n mubnél6n šét6t xámši-w †¬à°a,} ""u-xámši-w ""àrpa.}
       ‘As for houses, we had our villa built in the year fifty-three and
       fifty-four.’ (B1:20)An extraposed item may be left without any explicit resumption in the
clause. In such cases the extraposed element sets the orientation of the
clause, similarly to a clause initial adverbial, without playing a syntactic
role in it.  (13) †alòbe,} béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ‘As for the betrothal—they would make
       food.’ (B5:7)
  (14) m5xólta y-áwa mbúšle qawúrma-w rêzza,} ""u-k6ftàne.} ‘As for the food,
       they would have cooked qawurma, rice, meat-balls.’ (B5:15)
  (15) palá††6t ""9raq,} t-amrèxi,} y-a°7wa m5°7wa lìne ""í°wa,} d5r7wa lìne,}
       ""u-d5r7wa mìya gáwa.} ‘As for the production of arak, as we would
       say, they used to bring pots, they would put down the pots and
       put water into them.’ (B5:12)
  (16) sab-xlúla rába náše ‘5dˆwa.} ‘Because the wedding—they invited many
       people.’ (B5:23)A speaker sometimes extraposes the 1pl. independent pronoun in this way
when referring to activities in his own home or community.  (17) ""áxni b-sètwa mš7ra dúnye ràya} m6n-yárx6t ""êßra-w} xadèss6r hòd6x.} ‘We
       (= in our community)—in winter it starts raining from October
       and November onwards.’ (B5:145)
                                  the clause                                  899  (18) ""àxni} ""Ón-Núne npílta bel-†úra l-†ùra.} We—""“n-Nune is situated be-
       tween mountains.’ (B5:148)
  (19) ""áxni b7°6t be-bábi ""atìqa-wewa.} ""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùl-
       naše.} ‘We—the house of the family of my father was old, but
       it was higher than the villas of everybody (in our community).’
       (B10:51)In (20) and (21) the resumptive independent pronoun itself stands extra-
posed from the clause:  (20) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
       ‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or any-
       body—he—they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
       (A17:17)
  (21) xzi-""ánna †¬a-nàše} t-íla prím6lle tàwra,} †¬á°na hon-yíwt6lla mò'6d.} ‘Take
       note that the three people who slaughtered the ox—the three of
       them—I have given them an appointment.’ (A22:21)17.8.2. Function17.8.2.1. Discourse Boundary Marking
The function of the extraposition of an item at the front of a clause is
in most cases to express some kind of boundary and reorientation in the
discourse. The initial nominal expresses the topic referent of the clause,
which often has topical status also in the following clauses. When the
initial topic is given added prominence by being prosodically separated
from the rest of the clause in a different intonation group, the degree of
disjunction from what precedes is in principle enhanced. As we have seen,
subject initial clauses and ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses also have
a disjoining function. In these constructions also the degree of disjoining
is enhanced by the prosodic separation of the initial topical constituent.
The subject constituent may be separated from the rest of the clause by
an intonation group boundary, e.g.  (1)   šèra} xa-t6xrùny5le.} ‘The festival is a memorial.’ (B5:69)
  (2)   náša diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
        (B6:21)In copula clauses another type of prosodic separation of the initial sub-
ject topic constituent is its detachment from the copula, resulting in a
900                         chapter seventeenconstruction such as (3). Example (4) has the same structure, with the
copula after the subject, without the prosodic separation:  (3) gèrðo ""íla m6n-màsta.} ‘G6rðo is (made) of yoghurt.’ (B5:64)
  (4) xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed.’ (A24:42)It is worth noting that in some other NENA dialects, constructions that
correspond to (3) are extrapositional with an independent resumptive
pronoun attached to the copula, e.g. C. Qaraqosh:  (5) ""ójar ""áhu-l6 xa-mèndi d-gár6šl6 xmàra.} ‘The plough is something that
      an ass pulls.’ (Khan 2002: 412)The types of boundary that are expressed by extrapositional clauses in
the text corpus can be classified as follows:(i) Beginning of Speech
A speaker often opens a speech turn with a topic referent that is acces-
sible to the hearer. If this is not the subject of the clause, it stands in
extraposition, e.g.  (1) mère yêmmi} ""êdyo} †¬à°na} xon>wá°6t Qára Tè≥din} mopíš6lle l6bbèy.} ‘He
      said “Mother, today the three brothers of Qara Te≥din—their hearts
      became (angry).” ’ (A26:71)
  (2) mèra ""áwwa náša f>qìra} t-awéle xá bronà.} ‘They said “This poor
      man—to him will be a son (= he will have a son).” ’ (A8:3)
  (3) mère xàli} xmàre,} šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwe.} ‘He said “Uncle, the
      asses—the seven of them have been eaten by wolves.” ’ (A23:15)
  (4) ßlélux xá-bena xèna?} gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘ “Have you
      come down again?” “Your stupid club (literally: the club of your
      behind)—would I have been finished off by it?” ’ (A52:17)If the subject of the clause is a possession or attribute of the speaker or
hearer, the speech turn often begins with an extraposed 1st or 2nd person
independent pronoun respectively, e.g.  (5) ""ána šèmmi ’ùxole.} ‘I—my name is ’uxo.’ (A7:18)
  (6) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
      wood.’ (A12:39)
                                    the clause                                      901  (7)   ""ána ""úrxi rába rìxt5la.} ‘I—my way is very long (= I have a long way
        to go).’ (A8:42)
  (8)   ""áxni ""áti xà°6n-iw6t.} ‘We—you are our sister.’ (A34:16)
  (9)   ""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} ‘You—where is your strength?’ (A12:38)The choice of extraposed pronoun to open the speech turn depends on
the topicality of the referent in the ensuing discourse. This is seen in (10),
in which the first clause opens with the 2s. pronoun although the gram-
matical subject is 1fs., since the following clauses are ‘hearer-orientated’,
containing various deontic expressions addressed to the hearer:  (10) ""áti ràba b>yánnux.} bas-msà'6dli xá‘‘a.} hálli xákma mêndi} masqánne l-bˆ°a}
       ""u-""aßèrta b-l7le ""á°eti kêsli.} ‘I love you a lot. Only, help me a little.
       Give me something to take up to the house and tonight come to
       me.’ (A22:19)(ii) New Section of Discourse
On some occasions a construction with an initial extraposed topic referent
occurs at the onset of a section of discourse that is disjoined in some way
from what precedes. Various types of disjunction can be identified.
    In (1) the extrapositional clause coincides with a shift in topic referent:  (1)   xíllux táma mubsêmlux.} ""ána q6m-†arðìli.} ""è°y6n m-k7rbi hon-xíl6lla ""ày.}
        ‘You ate there and enjoyed yourself. I—they drove me out and,
        out of my anger, I have come and eaten it.’ (A2:11)The construction is used when there is continuity of a topic referent from
the preceding discourse but disjunction on some other level. In narrative it
is used to signal the onset of an event section that is presented as separate
from the previous one:  (2)   ""ím6t pìdle †úra,} ßàle} ""êlt6x.} réša xtáya kúlle mêlx5le.} sùsux} ""aqlá°e mdur-
        bênnela.} mèlxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye,} t-áwe súsa mßarßòre.} ‘When he has
        crossed over the mountain, he will go down. Down hill it is all
        salt. Your horse—(when) its legs have become wounded, salt will
        strike his legs and he will screech.’ (A24:12)In narrative the construction is used at the onset of a section that sup-
plies some kind of elaboration on what precedes rather than carrying the
narrative forward. In (3) it presents an event that is circumstantial to the
902                          chapter seventeenpreviously mentioned event. The extrapositional clause in (4) provides an
evaluative comment on what precedes rather than an event that is pre-
sented as sequential to what precedes. In (5) the narrator opens a section
that shifts to a point earlier in the time-line and recounts the events that
led to the protagonist becoming blind.  (3) qíme dwíqe xá b-aw-rùše} xá b-aw-rùše} nùbl6lle.} ""áw lá snidíle ""áqle dìye}
      q6m-nablìle.} ‘They held him, one this shoulder and one the other,
      and took him away. His legs did not support him. They took him
      away.’ (B9:24)
  (4) qímla zrá""a xabùše.} xabúše muntéwala bíya dìya.} ‘They began to cultivate
      apples. They were successful with apples.’ (B5:75)

      blind David—his father and mother pressed him and said “By God,
      we must marry you.” ’ (A16:5)In (6)–(8), from descriptive discourse, the extrapositional construction
constitutes an explanatory supplement to what precedes:  (6) béna gu-d-á-dana m5°7wa štˆ°a.} ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘At
      that time they brought drink. That drink—we produced it there.’

  (8) ""í°wa jawêtta.} jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘There was a chopper. The
      chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)In (9) the construction is used in a clause that repeats the content of the
preceding clause as a strategy to introduce elaborative material:  (9) y-áz6xwa ""áxni zóre m†alèxwa kolàne.} koláne m†alêxwa gáwa.} mattèxwala
       bé""e gu-ßawêlta.} ‘We would paint eggs. We young people would go
       and play in the streets. The streets—we would play in them and
       would put eggs in a shoe.’ (B16:5)In (10) the construction coincides with a shift from a general description
of a habitual situation to the description of a specific event, which is
offered as an illustration:
                                   the clause                                   903  (10) yawíwala xà-mdi.} ""ána xmá°i xá-dawa z8ra mutt7°6lli gu-""íð6t xóni ""Ìsh6q.}
       ‘They would give her (the bride) something. I—my mother-in-law
       put a yellow gold coin for me in the hand of my brother Ish6q.’
       (B8:35)An extrapositional construction is used after a presentative clause with
existential particles in (11) and (12). This is likely to be a strategy to mark
off the presentative clause with enhanced distinctness in order to give the
item presented added prominence:  (11) ""í°6n xa-†ùra.} †úra t-ásq6t bíye dìye,} kúlle skinyà°5le.} ‘There is a moun-
       tain. The mountain—you should go up it, it is all (covered in)

  (12) ""ítl6n ""7n6t ""ùmra.} ""ay-‘ú-ga lá-q7†a-w lá-s6twa bárzi míya dìya.} trè ""5ná°a
       ""ítl6n.} ‘We have the spring of the church. It—its water never dries
       up, in summer or winter.’ (B10:61)Generic or proverbial statements, which have an inherent independence
and distinctness from the preceding context, may open with an initial
topic standing in extraposition, e.g.  (13) ""ó-t šawèrra šáwwa sêkke,} ða-q7°a gu-be-têkke} ‘He who jumps seven
       stakes—(one stake) will hit him in his waist.’ (D2:1)

       ‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or
       anybody—he, they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
       (A17:17)In clauses denoting an iterative action containing a constituent with a
universal quantifier, the quantified phrase is often made the topic of the
clause and placed in extraposition, e.g.  (15) kut-mêsta} xa-zága dáry6t bìya.} ‘Put a bell on every hair.’ (A27:8)
  (16) kú-reš6t xúwwe °èle,} q6m-maxèle.} ‘He struck each head of the snake
       that came (his way).’ (A24:40)(iii) Opposition between Topics
In some cases the motivation for the extrapositional construction is to set
up an opposition or parallelism between two topic referents. Each topic
904                            chapter seventeenreferent is placed at the front of the clause and stands in extraposition if
it is not the subject referent, e.g.  (1) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu

  (3) zeðàye} ""áxl6t mènna t-là-qßaya.} ""u-màsta} ""áxl6t mènna qrúšta díya t-la-xàrwa.}

  (4) ""ína júllux hálla †làli.} ""u-xmártux t-átw6n ""àna l-xáßa.} ‘Your clothes—give
      them to me. Your donkey—I shall sit on its back.’ (A6:8)In (5) and (6) the extraposition of the topical subject constituent by means
of an independent pronoun is used to mark it off distinctly from a topic
of an adjacent clause:  (5) d>ráje t-kèp5la,} ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘Steps are made of stone, but
      a ladder—it is made of wood.’ (B10:60)
  (6) ""ánna qurðáye barzanàye} ""áni hóla jrà†a.} ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a.} ‘The Barzan
      Kurds were slipping, but the Christians were not slipping.’ (B19:7)(iv) Prominence of Clause
In some cases the main motivation for an extrapositional construction
with a clause initial topic is to mark it off distinctly from what precedes
in order to give it prominence, e.g.  (1) °éle xa-hambišàya.} hambišàya} ""ˆ-ga} xír5le bìye,} ""áwwa náša lèbbe pqìle!} ‘A
      giant came. The giant looked at him. That man’s heart burst (with

      water or anything else. You are indeed our brother.’ (A39:12)In (3) the extrapositional clause marks the climactic point of the discourse
section, the origin of the name of the church being the main point of
the narrative:
                                     the clause                                905  (3) gu-d-ò-""umra} †ùmr6lle} ""u-bènyela ""úmra b-réše dìye.} ""áw mútt6lle šèmme díye
      Mar-Sàwa.} ‘They buried him in (the site of) that church and built the
      church over him. They gave it the name of Saint Sawa.’ (B6:30)17.8.2.2. Topic Referents Obligatorily Resumed by L-Suffixes
In certain clauses, an initial topic referent regularly stands in extraposition
and is resumed on the verb by an L-suffix. These include the following:(i) ‘Naming’ Constructions with the Verb ""mr  (1) ""ó-""eða y-amrèxle šèra.} ‘That festival—we call it a šera.’ (B6:22)
  (2) ""áyya y-amrèxla m>màðta.} ‘This—we call it baptism.’ (B6:8)
  (3) ""áni xa†oryà°a y-amríla.} ‘They are called “washing-boards.” ’ (B19:9)(ii) Possessive Constructions with the Existential Particle  (4) ßlí°5la bàxta} xzí°a qa-màlla.} málla ""ítle d6kkán6t ""aparù°a.} ‘The woman
      went down (to the town) and saw the mullah. The mullah had a
      shop of household goods.’ (A22:11)
  (5) ""áw ""ítle ða-""ót6x ""ax-d-àyya.} ‘He has a room like this one.’ (A21:5)
  (6) ""àxni} gu-""Ón-Nùne} ""ítl6n šèra.} ‘We in ""“n-Nune have a saint’s festival.’
      (B5:72)(iii) Clauses Containing Verbs with Impersonal Subjects  (7) "">wáha t-ile xóðe díye b>yéle bàxta.} ‘The man who is alone needs a
      wife.’ (A27:7)17.8.2.3. Narrow focus
In some cases the nuclear stress is placed on an independent pronoun
that resumes an extraposed nominal phrase. This puts narrow focus on
the referent. The construction is typically used when the nominal is a
long phrase, e.g.  (1) kùt la-pál6x} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a} ""ixála lè y-áx6l.} ""o-t-pàl6x} ""àw t-áx6l.}
      ‘Whoever does not work in this house will not eat food. Whoever

This particle gives an expostulatory or hortatory sense to questions. When
used to introduce negative questions, which is its most frequent usage, the
question is equivalent in function to an asseveration, e.g.  (1) nèmu la-mèri-llux dày6‰,} mí°a dày6‰?} ‘Did I not tell you that he would
      return (= indeed I told you . . .), that the dead would return?’
      (A22:39)
  (2) nèmu ""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘At
      the wedding of Gw6rg6s did not my aunt buy his cake and say
      “(I buy it) for a beehive? (= indeed my aunt bought his cake . . .)” ’
      (B8:29–30)
  (3) nèmu la-""awðèxle ""áwwa †ùra} d>rajyà°a,} d>ràje,} t-ásq6x l-áwwa †ùra?}
      ‘Should we not make for this mountain steps (= indeed let us
      make . . .), so that we can go up the mountain?’ (A17:4)
  (4) lèmu lá-""asq6n ""àna?} ‘Should I not go? (= indeed I should go)’
      (A39:10)
  (5) lèmu lax-xnìq6llux?} ‘Have we not drowned you? (= surely we have
      drowned you)’ (A7:22)Occasionally the most appropriate translation of the particle is ‘why?’,
e.g.  (6) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmu
      la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
      you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)The particle is occasionally used in positive questions, where it has a
remonstrating force, e.g.  (7) nèmu ""áyya bèrke d-ˆnila} t-it-""áti sxáya gàwa?} ‘Whose is this pool in which
      you are swimming? (= surely it is mine not yours)’ (A25:61)17.9.2. xo-/xu-
This particle, which is related etymologically to Syriac k∫ar, is used most
frequently in negated clauses. When used in non-interrogative clauses, it
intensifies the negation, often with a remonstrating force, e.g.
                                  the clause                                  907  (1)   xo-la-m7°6n làxxa.} ‘I shall not die here.’ (A20:11)

remonstrating force, e.g.  (9)  xu-l7wa †axxána bròn-†axxanˆ°a?} ‘Was he really a miller, son of a
       miller woman?’ (A32:28)

                         18.1. Connective Particles18.1.1. w
When functioning as a clausal conjunction, the particle w may be attached
as a clitic either to the initial or final word of a clause. It is realized as ""u- (<
*""uw) when in contact with a consonant at the beginning of a word, e.g.  (1) ""áti tú-tiwa làxxa.} ""u-súsi páy6š làxxa} ""u-""ána bráta masq•nna be-bába dìya.}
      ‘You stay here and my horse will stay here and I shall take the girl up
      to the house of her father.’ (A29:41)
  (2) ""o-yál6t b>yàwale} hóle ""ê°ya-w} q6m-yaw•lla yalêx°a ""•lli.} ‘The young man
      whom she loved has come and has given me her scarf.’ (A4:24)Occasionally, the speaker attaches a particle as a suffix to the end of one
clause and then repeats it as a prefix to the following clause, e.g.  (3) mattíla gu-qußárta mbašlìla-w} ""u-yátwi ""àxli.} ‘They put them in a pan and
      cook them, then sit down to eat them.’ (A1:3)
  (4) mxúll6lla pá°e dìye-w} ""u-zíl5le šúle dìye.} ‘He washed his face and went to
      his work.’ (A21:16)The particle is used to express various types of semantic connection
between clauses. In most cases such semantic connections may also be
expressed by juxtaposing clauses asyndetically without the explicit linguistic
expression of the connection in the form of the connective particle.
   In narrative the particle is used to join clauses that express sequential
events. The majority of sequential clauses in narrative are joined asyn-
detically. The usual strategy is to use the particle before the final clause
of a chain of events. In this respect, therefore, it is a device for marking
sections of discourse that are presented as expressing closely cohering
events, e.g.
910                             chapter eighteen  (5)   ßléle gu-d-o-balù'a.} ""áwwa dúša t-wéwa pyàša} kúlla q6m-daréle gu-d-an-

        and attacked him and his donkey and ate him.’ (A14:22)The chain of sequential clauses may express habitual actions, future actions
or commanded actions, e.g.  (7)   y-asqíwa malw6šíwale jull-dìye} ""u-y-atwìwa.} ‘They would come up
        (from the river), dress him in his clothes and sit down.’ (B6:26)

  (9)   qù!} šqúlla ""áyya †àsa} ""u-háyyo mênni.} ‘Get up, take this bowl and
        come with me.’ (A15:11)The chain of clauses that occurs before the connective particle is used
can be of a considerable length. In (10), for example, the particle occurs
for the first time on the verb ""u-zìlle, which comes at the end of a long
sequence of clauses. This passage occurs at the beginning of the story and
the speaker presents the whole sequence has a coherent section, expressing
a single overall situation that sets the scene for what follows.  (10) °éle xa-náša swarìya,} rakáwa.} ßléle r6š-xa-""ˆna.} tìwle,} xílle mêndi,} štéle

       a horseman. He went to the spring. He saw the hundred dinars.
       He quickly took them, put them in his pocket and went off. The
       first (rider) said “Oh, I have forgotten my money. I’ll return and
       go to take my money from on top of the spring.” ’ (A15:1–2)
                               clause sequences                                  911A chain of events that is marked off as a unit by the connective particle
may be embedded as a component in a superordinate chain. Consider (11):  (11) ""aw-ßále táma mrap•xle xáwla b-réše dìye} ""u-""áyya q>páxta matt•xxa
       r6š-d-o-t8r6t gêppa.} ""u-mßál6x †la-y•mme díye ""áwwa qur†án6t xmàra.} ‘He
       will go down there, we shall throw the rope onto his head and we
       shall put this cover onto the opening of the cave. Then we shall
       take down to his mother this donkey blanket’.’ (A14:16)Here the first connective marks the end of a series of events that are
planned to take place in a cave. They are presented as a unit, as it were
a single overall activity. This activity at the cave is followed by another
event in which the participants shift to another location. This subsequent
event is joined by a connective particle, which can be regarded as link-
ing the preceding chain as a whole rather than simply the immediately
preceding clause. The particle, therefore, would mark the closure of the
whole composite series of events, which can be represented thus [[A-B-
""u-C] ""u-D].
   In some cases the connective is placed earlier than the final clause of a
sequential chain. This may reflect a strategy of presenting the final clause
as a supplementary tag to what precedes. This applies to the final clauses
in (12) and (13), which contain the verb ‘to go’ and have the function of
taking the participants off the scene. The connective is attached to the pre-
ceding clause, which is presented as the climax of the main chain of events:  (12) °éle xa-náša swarìya,} °éle zílle r6š-""ˆna.} xílle mêndi} ""u-šwíqle zúze díye
       táma zìlle.} ‘A horseman came, he came to a spring. He ate some-

912                            chapter eighteenIn (14) and (15) the final clause, without the connective, is a supplementary

of the sequential chain by the connective:  (14) K8rìm zìlle bar-xmáre díye} †la-m5°éwa xmáre dìye,} ""•°yela déwe gu-ða-lawùrta}

a connective, is appended to the preceding chain of sequential clauses as
an elaborative comment and is not intended to be a component of this
sequence:  (16) si-mxi-""áqlux gu-xáße díye l-àyya k7rta} ""u-hálle ßàle.} šám6† qðále dìye.}
       ‘Go and kick his back on the load (he is carrying) and let him go
       down (the mountain). Let him break his neck.’ (A15:13)The connective particle is used to mark the closure of a chain of turns of
direct speech introduced by the verb ‘to say’. These turns interlace their
way through a story and are often separated by sections of narrative. The
connective in the phrase ""u-m6re in (17) introduces a climactic speech at
the end of the story in which one of the protagonists reveals himself as
an angel. This is preceded by thirty-five occurrences of the direct speech
formula ‘x said’ without the connective. There is clearly a consciousness
on the part of the speaker that the turns in speech cohere together in a
thread. The final speech of the story is not introduced by the connec-
tive (""am6r). This can be regarded as an elaborative tag to what precedes,
functioning as an final epilogue rather than a section in the main chain
of speeches.  (17) m•re hé q6m-y>ðênna.} ""u-mêre si-dú‰ l-šòpux,} ""ax-""arbí-š6nne t-it-""áti

The resultative participle (q†ila I, mqu†la II, muq6†la III) relates to a situation
that results from a past event. It exhibits a semantic profile that includes
both dynamicity and stativity. In this respect it shares features with verbs,
which typically express dynamic events, and with adjectives, which denote
properties with a degree of durability and stability in time. The morpho-
logical form should be regarded as indeterminate with regard to dynamism
and stativity in that it may have a dynamic (verbal) or stative (adjectival)
interpretation according to the context in which it is used.
   The resultative participle occurs in the predicate of a clause with the
basic copula or the deictic copula. The interpretation of the participle
654                           chapter fifteenwith regard to dynamicity depends on (i) the actionality of the verb by
virtue of its lexical meaning and (ii) the transitivity of the clause.
   It is convenient to adopt here the classification of the actionality of
verbal events proposed by Vendler (1957, 1967). These include statives,
activities, achievements and accomplishments. Verbs with stative actionality
denote a durative, homogeneous state, e.g. to believe. Activities are durative,
homogeneous dynamic events, e.g. to run. The homogeneity of states and
activities is shown by the fact that any interval during which they take
place can be divided into homogeneous sub-intervals. They are said to
be ‘atelic’ events, in that they do not have an inherent, internal endpoint.
Achievements and accomplishments, by contrast, are ‘telic’ since they have
an inherent endpoint by virtue of their meaning. They contain an internal
boundary, whereby they are non-homogeneous at two sub-intervals of
the action. They include a dynamic component and an endpoint (telos)
attained by the completion of the event. The difference between achieve-
ments and accomplishments lies in the feature of durativity. The dynamic
component of achievements is not durative, e.g. to sit down, whereas dura-
tivity is present in the dynamic interval of accomplishments and can be
quantified by a temporal adverbial indicating a period of time, e.g. to boil
(‘The water boiled in five minutes’). A further type of actionality is that
of ‘punctual’ verbs, which denote atelic dynamic events that have only
minimal duration. As with other types of atelic events, punctual events
are homogeneous and do not result in a clear state that is defined by the
event, e.g. to sneeze.
   This scheme of classification may be summarized in the following
table:                               durative         dynamic        homogeneous
stative                           +                 –                +
activity                          +                 +                +
achievement                       –                 +                –
accomplishment                    +                 +                –
punctual event                    –                 +                +
The resultative participle may occur in a predicate of an intransitive
clause. Such constructions contain only a subject argument, which is the
affected participant in the event. The participle in these clauses may have
a verbal or adjectival interpretation. The crucial conditioning factor is the
actionality of the verb.

both a verbal and an adjectival interpretation. In the verbal interpreta-
tion, the predicate expresses the telic event including both its dynamic and
final static endpoint, the subject of the clause being either the agent or
the experiencer of the event. In the adjectival interpretation, it expresses
only the resultant state of the endpoint. Verbs of this nature falling into
the category of achievements, according to the classification described
above, include, for example, ""tw ‘to sit down’, kly ‘to stand up’, †l"" ‘to go
to sleep’, dmx ‘to lie down, go to sleep’, rkw ‘to mount (an animal)’, m†y
‘to arrive’, npl ‘to fall down’, pq"" ‘to split’, sps ‘to rot’, ""ßy/ßy"" ‘to get stuck’,
gðl ‘to become frozen’:  (1) ""áw hóle tìwa}                  ‘He has sat down’ (verbal)
                                      ‘He is seated’ (adjectival)
  (2) ""áw hóle †lìya}                 ‘He has gone to sleep’ (verbal)
                                      ‘He is asleep’ (adjectival)
  (3) ""áw hóle npìla}                 ‘He has fallen’ (verbal)
                                      ‘He is (lying) fallen’ (adjectival)The adjectival function of the resultative participle of such verbs is dem-
onstrated by the fact that it can function as an attributive modifier of the
participant that is affected by the event, i.e. the subject noun, e.g.  (4) ""aw-náša hóle tìwa}             ‘The man is seated’
      xzáy6nne ""aw-náša tìwa}         ‘I see the seated man’
  (5) ""aw-yála hóle †lìya}            ‘The child is asleep’
      xzáy6nne ""aw-yála †lìya}        ‘I see the sleeping child’
  (6) ""aw-yála hóle npìla.}           ‘The child is (lying) fallen’
      xzáy6nne ""aw-yála npìla.}       ‘I see the fallen child’Furthermore the adjectival interpretation of the copula predicate is shown
by the fact that it can be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’ in cases
where the resulting state is not permanent, e.g. héš hóle tìwa} ‘He is still
seated’, héš hóle †lìya} ‘He is still asleep’.
   The category of telic achievements include various verbs that denote
ingressiveness into a state. The subject of these is typically an experiencer
rather than an agent, e.g. pßx ‘to become merry’, xðy ‘to become happy’,
krb ‘to become angry’, my° ‘to become dead, die’:
656                           chapter fifteen  (7)   ""áw hóle xêðya}            ‘He has become happy’ (verbal)
                                   ‘He is happy’ (adjectival)
        naša x6ðya                 ‘A happy man’ (adjectival attribute)
  (8)   ""áw hóle mì°a}             ‘He has died’ (verbal)
                                   ‘He is dead’ (adjectival)
        naša mi°a                  ‘A dead man’ (adjectival attribute)Various telic intransitive verbs have a dynamic component with some
degree of quantifiable durativity and so should be classified as accomplish-
ments, although in some cases the subject is inanimate. These include,
for example, m-qrn ‘to grow up’, m-nty ‘to succeed’, r°x ‘to boil’, ómó ‘to
wither’, qry ‘to study (i.e. to apply one’s mind purposefully to the acquisi-
tion of knowledge), be educated’:  (9)   bróni hóle mq5rêna}        ‘My son has grown up’ (verbal)
                                   ‘My son is grown up’ (adjectival)
       brona mq5r6na               ‘A grown-up son’ (adjectival attribute)
  (10) míya hóla r°ìxe             ‘The water has boiled’ (verbal)
                                   ‘The water is boiling’ (adjectival)
       miya r°ixe                  ‘Boiling water’ (adjectival attribute)
  (11) ""áw hóle qêrya}             ‘He has studied’ (verbal)
                                   ‘He is educated’ (adjectival)
        naša q6rya                 ‘An educated man’ (adjectival attribute)If the resultative participle in an intransitive clause is from an atelic verb,
which by its nature does not express an event with an inherent resultant
state, only a verbal interpretation is possible. The participle does not func-
tion as an adjective expressing a state, as shown by the fact that it cannot
serve as an attributive adjectival modifier of the affected participant of the
event nor can it be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’. Attested atelic
intransitive verbs include those classified as activities and statives.
   Activity verbs include, for example, zmr ‘to sing’, bxy ‘to weep’, spr ‘to
wait’, plx ‘to work’:  (12) ""aw-náša hóle zmìra}        ‘The man has sung’ (verbal)
       *naša zmira
  (13) ""aw-náša hóle plìxa}        ‘The man has worked’ (verbal)
       *naša plixa

       *naša tpi°a
  (15) ""aw-náša hóle mtùnxa}       ‘The man has sighed’
       *naša mtunxaStative verbs include, for example, zd"" ‘to fear, be afraid’:  (16) ""aw-náša hóle zdìya}        ‘The man has feared’
       *naša zdiyaThe resultative participle is combined with the copula also in the predicate
of transitive clauses, which contain an argument in addition to that of the
subject. In such constructions the participle always has a verbal interpreta-
tion. The participle and the copula agree with the subject, e.g.  (17) ""aw-náša hóle dwíqa bàxta.} ‘The man has seized a woman.’ (verbal)Perfective transitive events are typically telic, in that they result in a state
which constitutes an inherent endpoint. The affected participant in the
event is generally the goal of the action, in (17) ‘a woman’, rather than
the subject referent. A resultative participle can only be used adjectivally
when it is a predicative or attributive adjective of the affected participant
of a telic event. It follows that the participle can be used adjectivally in
a passive construction such as (18), in which the affectee of the event is
subject. This is shown by the fact that it can be combined with the adverb
heš ‘still’, which can only be used in relation to states, e.g.  (18) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}     ‘The woman is seized’ (adjectival)
       ""ay-báxta héš hóla dwìqta} ‘The woman is still seized’ (adjectival)
       ""ay-baxta dwiqta           ‘The seized woman’ (attributive adjective)Such passive constructions can also have a perfective verbal interpreta-
tion, e.g.  (19) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}      ‘The woman has been seized’
658                          chapter fifteenThe agent is optionally expressed in a phrase introduced by the preposi-
tion l- or m6n. This can be used both when the participle has a verbal
interpretation and also when it is adjectival, e.g.   (20) ""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key has been made by Baz
        people’ (verbal)
        ""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key is made by Baz people’
        (adjectival)
        qðila mturßa l-baznaye ‘A key made by Baz people’ (adjectival attri-
        bute)In transitive clauses such as (17) the resultative participle and the copula
agree grammatically with the subject of the clause, which refers to the
agent, rather than the object, which refers to the affectee, so only a ver-
bal interpretation is possible. Furthermore, the grammatical agreement
with the subject, which is the agent of the event, forces the participle to
be interpreted with an active rather than passive voice. This active inter-
pretation is further demonstrated by the fact that pronominal objects are
expressed by attaching L-suffixes, which are used elsewhere to express the
pronominal object of active verbs, e.g.   (21) ""aw-náša hóle dwìq6lla} ‘The man has seized her’
        cf. ""aw-náša b-dawêqla} ‘The man will seize her’The behaviour of the resultative participle in the various structural con-
figurations discussed above may be summarized in the table below:                        Function                 Grammatical agreement
Intransitive telic      Verbal/adjectival        Grammatical subject
Intransitive atelic     Verbal                   Grammatical subject
Transitive active       Verbal                   Grammatical subject
Transitive passive      Verbal/adjectival        Grammatical subject
The following historical development of the construction may be hypoth-
esized. The resultative participle was originally an adjectival form qualify-
ing the affectee of an event, denoting the resultant state of the affectee
in a telic intransitive event or a transitive event. When used predicatively
an ambiguity developed between the interpretation of the function of the
construction as the expression of the resultant stative property (adjecti-
                             the syntax of verbs                              659val) or the verbal event that brought about the state (verbal). The verbal
interpretation was extended by analogy to intransitive atelic predicates,
which do not result in any state and could not by themselves provide the
semantic basis required for the formation of the resultative participle. It
was also extended by analogy to transitive active predicates. The feature
of agreement with the grammatical subject was extended by analogy
from the original intransitive/passive construction to the transitive active
construction.
   Regarding the copula component of constructions with the resultative
participle, this can be either the deictic copula or the basic copula. As
has been shown in §15.3.1.–§15.3.2., one of the conditioning factors for
selecting one particular type of copula is the nature of the predicate.
The enclitic basic copula and the deictic copula are used with predicates
expressing either contingent or permanent properties but the independent
basic copula is used only with predicates expressing permanent properties
that, typically, are intrinsic to the nature of the subject referent and have
not been acquired. It follows that it is in principle not appropriate to use
the independent copula with the resultative participle, which, whether
adjectival or verbal, expresses an acquired property of the subject. There
are sporadic exceptions to this principle, such as (22), where the speaker
appears to have used the independent copula in order to present the
property of being betrothed as a permanent property of the woman in
question:  (22) l7ðeti ""àyya} t-íla m6n-hèš t-la-bràya} ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi?} bàxtila.}
       ‘Don’t you know that she has been betrothed to me since before
       she was born? She is my wife.’ (A25:39)15.4.1.2. Function in Non-Narrative Discourse
We shall now examine in greater detail the function that these resultative
constructions have when used verbally.
   It is important to make a distinction between its usage in narrative texts
and its usage in non-narrative discourse.
   In non-narrative discourse the resultative form is used to denote the
result of a past verbal event that is in existence in the present. It is gener-
ally appropriate to translate it with the English present perfect. The deictic
copula is used with the participle to draw particular attention to a cur-
rent situation. There is a certain amount of subjectivity in the use of
the deictic copula, but it is generally employed in assertive clauses to
draw attention to a resultant state that has some kind of relevance to the
660                                chapter fifteenimmediate present moment in time, e.g. hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’. In inter-
rogative clauses the enclitic copula is used, e.g. ""6°y5le? ‘Has he come?’ The
construction is negated in both assertions and questions by the negative
copula, e.g. l5le ""6°ya ‘He has not come’, l5le ""6°ya? ‘Has he not come’.
   The expression hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’ denotes that the subject has the
property of ‘having come’, which is the result of a prior event of coming.
It asserts the existence in the present of the result of an event without
referring directly to any specific event that brought about this result.
Therefore, without further specification by a time adverbial in the clause
or by the discourse context, the statement hole ""6°ya denotes that he has the
property of ‘having come’ as a result of some unspecified event of coming
that occurred some time in the past. There is no restriction on when the
event occurred other than that it was some time before the present. The
q†ille form,6 by contrast, refers directly to a specific event in the past and
not to its result. The event has typically occurred in the recent past and
this may extend up to the present moment. The expression dìya °éle} ‘He
has come just now’ would be used to assert the occurrence of a specific
event that has just taken place. Likewise the q†ilwale form °ewale denotes
the occurrence of a specific event in the more remote past.
   It may be the case that the result of the actions of q†ille and q†ilwale
have some kind of relevance in the present. This is especially the case
with regard to q†ille, which, in conversational discourse, is often translated
most appropriately with the English ‘perfect of recent past’.7 Such resul-
tant present relevance is, however, an implicature of their use rather than
a component of their meaning. As remarked, the endpoint of an event
expressed by q†ille may be the present moment. The q†ille form °ele ‘He
has come’ would be used by a speaker when he sees a person walking
through the door of his home and the greeting said to the visitor on his
arrival would be b-šˆna °élux!} ‘You have come in peace!’ The resultative
form refers to a resultant state that holds at a period that is not adjacent
temporally with the endpoint of the event. The resultant state is discon-
nected from the event temporally in that the resultative form is typically
used after some time has elapsed after the event, crucially when none of
the event can be witnessed directly. The resultative form hole ""6°ya ‘He has
come’, for example, would be used when a guest is sitting in the house

     For the sake of conciseness we shall dispense with noting in all cases the fact that the
q6m-qa†6l and q6m-qa†6lwa forms are suppletive variants of transitive perfective q†ille and
q†ilwale forms when pronominal suffixes are added.

be used if any phase of the event of coming can be seen directly by the
speaker, even if this is only the static endpoint of his standing at the door.
One says dìya °éle} ‘He has come just now’ referring explicitly to the fact
that the endpoint of the event coincides with the present moment, but the
expression *diya hole ""6°ya would not be felicitous. The resultative form is
disconnected from the event also referentially in that it does not make any
direct reference to the specific event that caused the result in question.
   The result expressed by the resultative form may be an actual perceptible
situation or an experiential property of the subject referent, e.g.  (1) hón xíla gêrðo.} ‘I have eaten stew.’
  (2) xílli gêrðo.} ‘I have eaten the stew.’Example (1) may be interpreted as asserting that at the present moment
there is a perceptible result of my having eaten stew at some unspecified
time in the past, e.g. I had a large stew for lunch and cannot eat much
dinner. This construction could also be interpreted as asserting that I have
the permanent property of being in the state of having eaten stew, i.e.
it has been part of my life experience. In this interpretation it denotes
that on some occasion, possibly on more than one occasion, I have eaten
stew, though not necessarily recently. The purpose of the deictic copula
in both interpretations would be to draw attention to the relevance of the
past event to the present moment in time. In both cases there is a degree
of indeterminateness concerning the event. The verbal form implies the
existence of at least one unspecified member of the set of past events of
eating. In the first interpretation the implication from the discourse context
in which it is used (e.g. in response to the question ‘Why do you not want
to eat your dinner?’) is that there was only one unspecified event. In the
experiential interpretation the possibility remains open that there were
more than one. In example (2) the q†ille form, by contrast, refers to the
occurrence of one specific event that occurred at a specific point in time
in the recent past. In such a construction the noun g6rðo would, therefore,
normally be definite with a specific identifiable referent.
   The context may force a definite interpretation of an object nominal
of a resultative construction, e.g.","[691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 698, 699, 700]"

commonly used as an adverbial meaning ‘beyond, further’, e.g.  (2) m-táma hód6x t-áz6t má†6t xa-nèra.} ‘Go onwards from there and you
      will reach a river.’ (A14:50)It is often combined with biš, e.g. xá‘‘a xéna biš-hód6x ‘a little further on’

e.g.  (3) m-táma hòd6x} ""áxtu ""u-g yanˆxu.} ‘From then onwards you are by your-
      selves.’ (A8:27)14.9.17. ‘u
This is used as a negative determiner in the sense of ‘not any.’ The predi-
cate of the clause in which it occurs is itself always negative, e.g.  (1) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘and for you I have not left anything.’

The particle hi‘ is used with the same function as ‘u by some speakers,

can be classifed as follows.","[589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594]"
"18.5.1. Major Juncture
The intonation expressing major juncture is characterized by a low fall
in pitch at the end of the intonation group. There is sometimes a slight
rise in pitch on the nucleus. Any syllables occurring after the nucleus have
decreasingly lower levels of pitch. This contour is represented by the sym-
bol . It expresses completeness and disjunction from what follows. As is
the case with many syntactic expressions of disjunction, the decision as to
where such a signal of disjunction should be placed is generally governed
by the choice of the speaker as to how he wishes to present the discourse
to the hearer. Examples:  (1) ""o-gó‰a píšle tàma. } ‘The eldest one remained there.’ (A24:5)
  (2) xa-n>ßíy6t t-yánna †làlux. } ‘I’ll give you some advice.’ (A24:9)
  (3) lá-""awð6t xá-mdi xéna t-la-b-dìyi. } ‘Do not do anything else without
      me.’ (A24:9)Speakers separate clauses with major juncture to express lack of sequen-
tiality in a variety of contexts.
   In (4) the major juncture is used to separate two clauses that are not
connected in temporal sequentiality, but rather are overlapping temporally.
The second clause does not complete the first so much as stand in parallel
with it, giving a supplementary description of the same event. Similarly
in (5) the second clause does not follow temporally or logically from the
first but rather elaborates on it:  (4) ""an-míya p7ši trè-q6sme. } kàli. } ‘The water will become (divided into)
      two parts. It will stop.’ (A24:14)
  (5) wúðuli xa-‘àra. } xzóli xa-darmána qa-""ˆni. } ‘Cure me. Find a remedy
      for my eyes.’ (A24:2)
                              clause sequences                                947In (6) the disjunctive prosody separates a prohibition from a follow-
ing instruction, which is supplementary to the prohibition rather than
sequential to it:  (6) là-šoq6t t-kále. } máx6t ""•lle díye ta-t-""ás6q payêdle ""o-†úra. } ‘Do not let
      him (the horse) stop. Strike him so that he will go up and cross over
      that mountain.’ (A24:11)When the clauses express temporally sequential events, the purpose of
the major disjuncture is to make a clear division between the two and to
signal that they are not seamlessly connected. This may coincide with a
spatio-temporal shift, as in (7) in which the arrival at the palace is separated
from the event of crossing the water in both place and time:  (7) ""u-p5ðêtla ""an-míya. } má†6t l-qáßr6t Parizàda. } ‘You should cross the
      water. Then you will arrive at the palace of Parizada.’ (A24:14)18.5.2. Minor Juncture
The intonational contour that are typically associated with minor juncture
consists of a rise in pitch on the nucleus. This is typically followed by a mid
fall on the syllables coming after the nucleus. Such a contour is represented
here by the symbol . Minor juncture contour signals incompleteness. It
is regularly used on a clausal constituent that is uttered in an intonation
group that is separate from that of the rest of the clause. This applies to
the clause initial subjects and extraposed items in (1)–(4):  (1) báxta yaqùrta, } ""i-màbra. } ‘A pregnant woman will give birth.’
      (A24:13)
  (2) ""o-gò‰a } m•re ""ána p7š6n láxxa gu-d-áyya mðìta. } ‘The eldest one said
      “I shall remain here in this town.” ’ (A24:4)
  (3) ""an-š5r°† } láz6m y>ð•tla mòdila. } ‘The conditions—you must know
      what they are.’ (A24:10)
  (4) sùsux } ""aqlá°e mdurbênnela. } ‘Your horse—his legs have become
      wounded.’ (A24:12)Likewise, if a constituent is placed at the end of the clause in a separate
intonation group, the clause is connected to the postposed constituent by
minor juncture. This applies to (5) and (6), which have a postposed subject
and adverbial respectively:
948                           chapter eighteen  (5)   ""ì°wale } †¬à bnóne. } ‘He had three sons.’ (A24:1)
  (6)   t-yáxlux xamšì dináre } kut-yàrxa. } ‘We’ll give you fifty dinars every
        month.’ (A24:7)When the speech reported by the verb ‘to say’ is placed following it in a
separate intonation group, the clause with this verb regularly has minor
juncture, e.g.  (7)   qím5le m•re qa-bnóne dìye: } bnòni } wúðuli xa-‘àra. } ‘He said to
        his sons “My sons, cure me!” ’ (A24:2)Minor juncture is typically used in clauses that occur in non-final position
in a sequence, the final clause in the sequence being marked by a major
juncture intonational contour. The clauses connected in this way may be
temporally sequential, as in (8). The effect is to present the two events as
closely linked together. Minor juncture is commonly used in clauses con-
taining the verb qym (9) or a verb of movement (10–11). As we have seen
in §18.3.1. and §18.3.2., these types of verbs also exhibit a tendency to
be closely bound prosodically with what follows by being combined with
a following verb in the same intonation group.  (8)  m•lxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye, } t-áwe súsa mßarßòre. } ‘He will get salt
       on his legs and will screech.’ (A24:12)
  (9) qímela †¬á°na t-bnóne dìye } ""u-zìlela. } ‘The three sons of his set off
       and went on their way.’ (A24:3)
  (10) zílela m•†ye gu-ðá mðìta. } ""o-gò‰a } m•re ""ána p7š6n láxxa gu-d-áyya
       mðìta. } ‘They travelled and arrived in a certain town. The eldest
       one said “I shall remain here in this town.” ’ (A24:4)
  (11) ""o-zóra zílle b-""ùrxa. } zílle, zílle, zìlle, } ""•šta šáwwa yomàne, } m†éle
       xa-náša sàwa. } ‘The young one went on the road. He went along
       for six or seven days and came upon an old man.’ (A24:7)In constructions such as those described in §18.4., in which a boundary is
expressed in the discourse by repeating the content of a clause, the first
clause has major juncture and the repeated clause, which is presented as
the onset of a new section, has minor juncture, e.g.  (12) qímela ""an-tre-xéne zìle. } zílela ""an-trè. } ""ap-o-gawàya } m†éle ða-mðìta.
          } ‘The other two went off. The two went off. Also the middle
       one came to a town.’ (A24:5–6)
                                clause sequences                             949  (13) t-yánnux xámši dináre kut-yàrxa. } kut-yárxa t-yánnux xámši dinàre, }
       ""u-plúx m6n-d-ànna paloxáye. } ‘I shall give you fifty dinars each
       month. Each month I shall give you fifty dinars, now work with
       these labourers.’ (A24:5)Clauses containing the existential particle that introduce a referent into
the discourse frequently have minor juncture. This is because such clauses
are closely connected with what follows in that they typically create the
expectation that the ensuing clauses will elaborate further on the newly
introduced referent, e.g.  (14) ""í°wa xa-màlka. } ""ì°wale } †¬à bnóne. } ‘There was once a king.
       He had three sons.’ (A24:1)18.5.3. Interrogative Clauses
Interrogative clauses are uttered with a rise from a higher level of pitch
than that of minor juncture (1–3). There is a short fall on syllables after
the nucleus. The contour is represented here by the symbol . Nega-
tive interrogative clauses that function as a device for drawing attention
to preliminary background material (§18.2.1.) typically have a lower
level of pitch than the normal interrogative contour (4). To distinguish
these two levels of pitch the symbol of the lower level is qualified by the
numeral 1 whereas the symbol for the regular interrogative contour has
the numeral 2:  (1)   mò t-óð6t? 2} ‘What will you do?’ (A24:4)
  (2)   k6mà t-yátli? 2} ‘How much will you give me?’ (A24:5)
  (3)   mòdila? 2} ‘What are they?’ (A24:11)
  (4)   ""ánna l7la dmìxe, 1} ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta. } ‘While
        they were asleep, the monk put his leg onto the leg of the woman.’
        (A16:11)When a question is rhetorical and does not expect an answer, it may have
a low fall intonation characteristic of major juncture, e.g.  (5)   m•re qá-mo là? } ‘He said “Why not?” ’ (A24:7)
950                            chapter eighteen18.5.4. Asseverative Clauses
Clauses that are intended to make a forceful asseveration are uttered
by speakers with a very high level of pitch, higher than the interroga-
tive pitch contour. It includes a rise and fall. This will be represented as
pitch level 3 by the symbol 3. This type of pitch is typically used, for
example, in asseverations containing the negative particle la (cf. §17.2.
and §17.7.14.2. iii):  (1) la-hóle mì°a. 3} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
  (2) A: štélux ‘àyux? 2} B: la-štèli! 3} ‘A: “Have you drunk your tea?”
      B: “Indeed I have drunk it!” ’

may stand independently of a head nominal and have themselves the
status of a nominal. We shall refer to these types as attributive relative
clauses and nominal relative clauses respectively.","[985, 986, 987, 988, 989, 990]"
"17.1.1.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
When the clause contains a subject constituent in the form of an inde-
pendent pronoun or a nominal, the subject is normally placed before the
824                         chapter seventeenpredicate and the copula is suffixed to the predicate with the nuclear stress
occurring on the predicate, e.g.  (1)   ""ána màlk6n.} ‘I am a king.’ (A4:30)
  (2)   ""áwwa nišànq5le.} ‘It is a symbol.’ (B5:41)
  (3)   bráta zamàrt5la.} ‘The girl is a singer.’ (A25:68)
  (4)   xáli zàngin-ile.} ‘My uncle is rich.’ (A23:3)
  (5)   w-áw xamìm5wa.} ‘It was warm.’ (B5:154)
  (6)   xóne díye f>qìra-wewa.} ‘His brother was poor.’ (A25:1)When the predicate is a 1st or 2nd person pronoun, the copula agrees
with the predicate, e.g.  (7)   ""áni xášwi ""áti ""àn6n.} ‘They will think you are me.’ (A7:18)The subject constituent may occur in a separate intonation group. Con-
structions such as these often occur at some kind of boundary in the
discourse. The clause in (8), for example, opens a section of discourse
concerning the village saint’s festival. The clause in (9) marks the onset
of a concluding comment on the preceding foreground section of the
discourse concerning the cultivation of apples. The clause in (10) occurs
at the onset of a turn of speech:  (8)  šèra} xa-t6xrùny5le.} ‘The festival is a memorial.’ (B5:69)
  (9)  ""u-xayu°èy} b-àyy5wa.} ‘Their livelihood was in this (profession).’
       (B5:106)
  (10) ""ána-w ""àti} xon>wà°5w6x.} ‘You and I are brothers.’ (A26:49)The copula is occasionally placed on the subject constituent. The motiva-
tion for such a construction is to express the prominence of the subject.
This may be focal prominence or topical prominence (§15.4.1.4.1. i–ii).
When it has focal prominence it functions as an information focus. This
is signalled on the prosodic level by the placement of the nuclear stress
on the subject constituent, e.g.  (11) ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He is not a dog, you are a dog.’
       (A11:20)
  (12) dêbb5la táma} ‘The bear is there.’ (A20:7)
                                   the clause                                    825In (11) and (12) the predicate belongs to the presuppositional background
of the clause. In (11), for example, the presupposition is ‘x is a dog’ and the
subject constituent supplies the new information that x is to be identified
with ‘you’. The clauses are used in a context in which the speaker assumes
that the hearer is entertaining another referent for the role in question
and the purpose of the construction is to reverse this expectation.
   In (13) the construction is used to express an exclusive focus after the
particle har:  (13) lèmu har-àtit ""árya?} ‘Is it only you who are a lion? (literally: Only you
       are a lion?)’ (A46:3)When the subject constituent with the enclitic copula is topically promi-
nent, the nuclear stress remains on the predicate. The topical prominence
of the referent arises from the fact that it has been evoked in the imme-
diately preceding discourse. This construction is not regularly used with
all subject constituents that have been previously evoked. The purpose
of the ‘heavy coding’ of the initial topical subject is to mark a boundary
in the discourse, endowing the clause with a distinctness from what pre-
cedes. This may mark a new discourse section, as in (14) and (15), where
the clauses are concluding comments on a preceding foreground section.
The construction is also used to give a clause distinctness for the sake of
making it more prominent, as is the case in (16):  (14) ""áwwa mèšxa y-amrèxle óìta.} ""áwwa ""i-map6lxìle} ""èn y-axlíle b-lêxma,} ""èn
       ""i-d5ríle b-rêzza,} . . . ""áyy5la óìta.} ‘We call this butter óita. They use
       it—either they eat it on bread or they put it in rice or, when they
       cook rice . . . This is butter.’ (B6:40–41)
  (15) ""o-yál6t b>yàwale} hóle ""ê°ya-w} q6m-yawèlla yalêx°a ""èlli.} ""u-""áyy5la kùlla.}
       ‘The young man whom she loved has come and has given me her
       scarf. That is all.’ (A4:24)
  (16) xúwwele q†ìla.} ‘The snake is killed.’ (A24:42)The topical prominence marked by the copula may also be forward
pointing, i.e. the item is marked as having relevance in the subsequent
discourse. This is found in constructions with the deictic form hatxa or
had6x ‘thus’, when it has a forward pointing correlative function in that it
relates to what is specified in the following clause, e.g.
826                         chapter seventeen  (17) hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye} ""u-hóle míra ""áyya bráti
       qa-brònux.} ‘This is the situation: the king has brought his daughter
       and said “This daughter of mine is for your son, that is she will
       become your wife.” ’ (A21:8)The enclitic copula, therefore, expresses a general prominence, which is
unmarked with regard to its pragmatic nature. The nucleus of the intona-
tion group, on the other hand, expresses a new information focus. The
two devices usually coincide, in that the enclitic copula is generally placed
on the element that is the new information focus of the clause. They may,
however, operate independently, as in (14)–(17).
   On some occasions the subject constituent is placed after the predicate.
In such cases the enclitic copula and the nuclear stress are generally on
the predicate, e.g.  (18) ""àww5le geyása.} ‘The geyasa ceremony is this.’ (B6:4)
  (19) ""ànn5la ""eð>wá°6 diy7ni.} ‘Our festivals are these.’ (B6:16)

       people came and rebuilt his house, in six or seven days. Jazire Bota

       a man in the town who was poorer than anybody else. The man
       was very poor.’ (A8:3)Constructions with postposed subjects such as (18)–(22) are typically used to
express an elaborative comment on something that has been talked about
in the immediately preceding discourse. They are intended to be cohesive
with what precedes more than with what follows. The subject is a topical
referent and not part of the information focus of the clause.
   This construction is used also in clauses that repeat information that
has been given in what immediately precedes without advancing the dis-
course. This is the case in (23), where the postposed subject is placed in
a separate intonation group:
                                    the clause                                     827  (23) mèra g8r6g m7°6t sisisàmb6r.} sáw6n Tóma smèle, píšle kòra.} sisisàmb6r}
       ""ˆk5la?} k6s-Lelì°a.} ""áp-xa lá-maße má†e ""èlla dìya.} k6s-Lelì°5la} sisisàmb6r.}
       ‘They said “You must bring the sisisamb6r plant. Grandfather
       Toma has become blind.” “Where is the sisisamb6r?” “With Leli°a.
       Nobody can reach it. The sisisamb6r is with Leli°a.” ’ (A50:1)When the referent of the subject constituent has been mentioned in the
immediately preceding discourse, the copula is occasionally placed on the
postposed subject rather than on the predicate. The copula in such cases
signals the topical prominence of the subject constituent, e.g.  (24) mère k yˆle qáßre díye?} . . . mère "">wà""ha qáßre díyele.} ‘He said “Where is
       his residence?” . . . He said “His residence is that (over there).” ’
       (A37:10)The motivation for a construction with a postposed subject such as (24)
is again to signal cohesiveness with what precedes, in this case supplying
the answer to a preceding question. When, conversely, a topical subject
constituent occurs at the front of a clause, this typically expresses a less
cohesive connection with what precedes. As we have seen, the discourse
boundary marking function may be enhanced by increasing the coding
of the subject topic by means of the enclitic copula (14–16).","[862, 863, 864, 865, 866]"
"19.5.6.1. Disjunctive Particle (‘either . . . or’)
Several speakers use ""6n as a disjunctive between items. It is used either
before each item ""6n . . . ""6n (‘either. . . . or’) or only before the final item. The
items may be clauses (1–2) or constituents of clauses (3–5)

copula may remain in its normal position on the predicate (7–8):  (6) ""Øx ""áw gáw‰i m-jàlde hóle zíla} lá-""6°ya l-b7°a ≥àre,} ""6n-ile-q†ìla,} ""6n-ile xìla.}

1022                          chapter nineteen19.5.7. Conditionals with madam
On some occasions constructions that can be rendered into English as
conditionals have the particle madam in the protasis rather than the usual
conditional particle ""6n. The use of madam is restricted to clauses describ-
ing a situation that the speaker knows is true. For this reason the particle
in the protasis clause can usually be approprately translated also by an
factive English subordinate clause such as ‘since (it is the case that) . . .’.
The particle madam is generally connected to the following clauses by the
D subordinator, though this is omitted in some cases, e.g.  (1) mádam hàtx5la} t-áz6n †8y6n bá°6r ˙aqqù°a} ""u-na-˙aqqù°a.} ‘If (the world)
      is like that, I shall go and search for what is lawful and what is
      unlawful.’ (A15:5)
  (2) mádam t-íw6t hàtxa} háyyo láxxa t-awð•nnux w9zīr.} ‘If you are like this,
      come here and I shall make you the vizier.’ (A21:41)

      has become hard-working and has learnt to work, I want to know
      what (kind of person) this man is, how could he have made this girl
      a hard-working housewife.’ (A21:32)
  (4) ""áwwa mádam ""ì°wale} bàxta,} ""í°wale bnòne,} ""í°wale nàše,} ""áwwa lˆle mí°a.}
      ‘If he had a wife, he had sons, he had relatives, he is not dead.’

      you. Come, don’t go.’ (A24:36)19.5.8. Conditionals with ""5-ga
Similarly a clause introduced by the adverbial ""5-ga referring to a situation
that the speaker knows is true may sometimes be rendered idiomatically
by an English conditional, e.g.  (1) ""7-g6t m6n-d-ánna hàwe,} šúla bt-áz6l l>-qàma!} ‘If there are these (gold
      pieces), the job will go ahead!’ (A4:15)

On a number of occasions the semantic relation between a series of clauses
is that of condition and consequent, but they are juxtaposed asyndetically
without a conditional particle. It is often appropriate to translate such
clauses by an English conditional sentence. They often contain verbal
forms that are characteristic of ""6n conditional constructions., e.g.  (1)   ""ána t•mm6l ""à°ena,} ""áti mxazdêtli.} ‘If I come tomorrow, you will
        blame me.’ (A21:43)
  (2)   ""àti} díya ""á°6t gu-b7°i la-pàlx6t,} lè-yannux ""ixála.} ‘If you come now, come
        to my house and do not work, I shall not give you food.’ (A21:36)

        shall see whether I can find a solution. If I cannot, have my son
        killed, what can I do?’ (A33:6)
  (4)   mqáwl6t goràtle,} t-yálla jùlla.} ‘If you promise to marry him, he will
        give back the clothes.’ (A14:83)
  (5)   gúrza maxèle} ""áy bá≥6r kúlla t-aw•dla mìya.} ‘If he struck with his club,
        he would make all of that town turn to water.’ (A52:15)
  (6)   l7le jyàra,} š>y•tle b-gùda.} ‘If he does not pass water, throw him
        against the wall.’ (A30:40)
  (7)   kút-dana ""a-ß•pra mìtle,} ""7-ga ""ana-mˆ°6n.} ‘If ever that sparrow dies,
        then I shall die.’ (A12:41)
  (8)   t•mm6l y•mmi mìtla,} p7š6x ""ána-w bàxti.} ‘If my mother dies tomorrow,
        we shall remain, myself and my wife.’ (A21:42)
  (9)   mu°yále B•lb6l Hazàr,} p7ša kàl°i.} ‘If he brings B6lb6l Hazar back,
        she will become my daughter-in-law.’ (A8:34)Such asyndetic conditional constructions are commonly found with the
verb ‘to want’ in the protasis, e.g.  (10) b8y6t ""àxl6t,} xùl!} ‘If you want to eat, eat!’ (A14:59)
  (11) ""•rwe hòla gu-†úra.} b9y6t,} s5-mkàp6šla!} ‘The sheep are in the moun-

       our son and she will be queen in my place when I die. But, if she
       wants to return to her father’s house, I shall put her again (on a
       camel) and return her.’ (A4:39)

       it (fine). If you do not want it, there is Saddam, go and complain
       (to him).’ (B1:22)Such asyndetic conditional constructions generally have a rising intona-
tion contour in the intonation group of the first clause, which typically
expresses conjunction with what follows, e.g.  (14) súsux b8ye t-kàle, } là-šoq6t t-kále. } ‘If your horse wants to stop, do
       not let him stop.’ (A24:11)In (15) an asyndetic conditional is followed by a negative alternative con-
dition that has the conditional particle, demonstrating the equivalence
between the asyndetic and syndetic constructions:  (15) m5°êtta-lli,} šoq•nnux t-àz6t.} ""ên-la,} là-šoq6n t-azítu.} ‘If you bring her
       here, I shall let you go. If not, I shall not let you go.’ (A12:21)In (16) the presentative particle ""ina is used to introduce a protasis that
lacks the conditional particle:  (16) ""ína ""ánna xon>wà°i,} ""arbì xon>wá°i,} kúšš6t magúr6t xà,} páy6š ""úmri tmàni
       š•nne.} ‘If each year you marry off one of these forty brothers of
       mine, I’ll be eighty years old (before I marry).’ (A12:1)Conditional type constructions are sometimes expressed by imperative
clauses, e.g.  (17) la-xzì} ""u-la-x†ì.} ‘If you do not see, you will not sin.’ (D2:49)
  (18) wí mbaqràna,} t-áw6t yaðùwa.} ‘If you are inquisitive, you shall be
       knowledgeable.’ (D2:11)Expressions of a wish that appear unlikely to be fulfilled (‘if only . . .!)
use the qa†6lwa verbal form, which is characteristic of protases denoting
an improbable situation in the future, e.g.  (19) xuš-mˆ°6n} bas-xá°i Nozáli xazênwala.} ‘Let me die, but, if only I could
       see my sister Nozali.’ (A8:57)
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                        1025An asyndetic conditional may lack verbal forms, especially in proverbial
contexts, e.g.  (20) dárta l-yòma,} ""•rwe gu-gòma.} dárta l-sèra,} ""•rwe l-†èra.} ‘If the sun has
       a halo, the sheep will be in the basement stable. If the moon has
       a halo, the sheep will be in the noon sun.’ (D2:15)
  (21) t8ra dwìra} q8da wìra.} ‘If the door is closed, trouble passes by.’
       (D2:47)Asyndetic constructions are used also when a consequent follows a clause
expressing a situation that is presupposed to be true and so has the func-
tion of a temporal ‘when’–clause, e.g.  (22) bábi mày6°,} ""ána bt-áw6n málka šòpe.} ‘When my father dies, I shall
       be king in his place.’ (A14:88)
  (23) t-ámr6x háyyo ßlí K>r≈m ""áti gu-d-áwwa balù'a} . . . ""aw-ßále táma mrap•xle

       that horse go.’ (A12:29)
                     19.6. Concessive ConstructionsThe syntactic expression of concession is rarely found in the text corpus.
Where this occurs, it tends to take the form of a protasis clause introduced
by phrases denoting literally ‘even if ’ (""ap-""6n / ""up-""6n, ham-""6n), e.g.  (1)   ""úp-""6n-iwa xayú°a pšì††a,} ""ánna náše ráb5wa xêðye.} ‘Although the life
        was simple, people were very happy.’ (B15:14)
  (2)   hám-""6n wídle hátxa ""àp-aw,} ""áp ""axni-xìl6xwale táwre díye.} ‘Although he
        did such a thing, (we should take into account that that) we had
        eaten his ox.’ (A7:20)
1026                           chapter nineteenNote also the use of the Arabic conditional concessive w>-law in (3):  (3) w8-law t-ín ""anna-xámša š•nne zíla b-dùnye,} n•mu lat-ðà""6lli?} ‘Although I
      have been away in the world for these five years, don’t you know me
      any more?’ (A12:65)In these sentences, despite the conditional structure, the truth of the pro-
tasis is not in question. The concessive sense is that the situation described
in the subordinate clauses might lead one to expect that the proposition
of the main clause would be false but, in fact, this is not the case. A pure
conditional ‘even if ’ construction is related, in that it indicates that the
situation of the main clause is not expected to follow from the condition
but nevertheless will do so. The difference from a concessive construction
is that the truth of the protasis is not certain. There are various ways of
expressing pure conditional ‘even if ’–clauses, including clauses introduced
by a conditional and one of the inclusive particles ""ap/""up, ham and -≥i, e.g.  (4) bnáya gúda ""u-dráya r>ß?ß,} tá-t ""áp-""6n maxíle màdfa'} t-là-tal6xwa gúda.} ‘He
      built the wall and put lead into it, so that, even if it was hit by artil-
      lery, it would not be destroyed.’ (A11:13)
  (5) hám-""6n yaw•tli zùze,} lè-y-a°6n.} ‘Even if you give me money, I shall
      not come.’
  (6) ""6n-háwe dàwa-≥i} ""áxni t-yaw•xla xa-b-†¬à°a ""•lle díye.} ‘Even if it is gold,
      we shall give him threefold (if it is lost).’ (A7:10)In (7) it is expressed by a simple ""6n clause, but this is given prominence
on a prosodic level by being uttered with a high pitch level:  (7) là-b-alaha,} lá q5ß•nne rèšux,} ""6n-qa†lêtli.} ‘No, by God. I shall not cut
      (the hair on) your head, even if you kill me.’ (A29:6)A concessive relationship sometimes exists between clauses that are linked
paratactically. In such cases the grounds for the reversed expectation,
equivalent to the subordinate ‘although’ clause, is usually conjoined after
the other clause with the connective particle w, e.g.  (8) málka krìble} ""u-b-gáne málka mír5wa ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.}
      ‘The king became angry, although the king himself had said “if I
      have a daughter I shall give her to your son.” ’ (A25:8)

        became enemies, although they had not met each other and had
        not said (to each other) any such a thing.’ (B19:2)Concession may be expressed by an asyndetic conditional type construc-
tion, e.g.  (10) tú póìla,} mßáw6° d°s.} ‘Sit crooked (= even though you sit crooked),
       tell the truth.’ (D2:60)

"18.1.6.1. Temporal Sequence
It sometimes signals the temporal sequentiality of an event in relation to
what precedes, e.g.
                              clause sequences                                933  (1) r8pili m-an-képe t-íla tàma,} ga-maxz•nnux ""úrxa ßàl6t.} ‘Throw me the

  (2) híw5le xábra †la-d-àn maymúne} ga-wírra xa-xaðù°a gáwa.} ‘He gave word
      to the monkeys and then they became very happy.’ (A14:47)
  (3) ga-m•re mo-sùs5le?} ‘Then he said “What horse is it?” ’ (A12:62)18.1.6.2. Introducing Comment
It may introduce a clause that presents a comment on what precedes.
This may be adversative in sense (1):  (1) lá-m6re b8ye xà°ux.} m•re b8ye Zìne.} ga-""7ni Zìne} ""áxni lˆð6x.} ‘He did not
      say “He loves your sister.” He said “He loves Zine.” Now, we do not
      know (by this statement) which Zine (was meant).’ (A26:61)

      not know where she is, in what place she is, what the road is.” ’
      (A26:18)18.1.6.3. Introducing Direct Speech
It is used at the beginning of direct speech, predominantly questions, e.g.  (1) m•ra ga-mo-xêðye b-áwwa dúša?} ‘They said “Why are we so happy
      about this honey?” ’ (A14:15)

      ask you “Whose are these?”, say “Well, these belong to Ajd6n the
      fox.” ’ (A32:17)
                           18.2. Negated ClausesHere we shall examine two features of clause sequences containing
negated clauses.
934                            chapter eighteen18.2.1. Negated Interrogative Clauses Expressing Preliminary Background Material
A negated clause that is pronounced with intonation patterns related to
those of questions (§18.5.3.) is sometimes used to signal that the situation
described in the clause should be taken as the grounds for what follows.
The construction is a device to draw attention to the clause, in order to
set it up as a boundary in the discourse, acting as the onset of a new
section. It is most commonly used to express temporal background. This
may express a situation that overlaps temporally with the following main
event (1–2) or a preceding event that marks its onset (3–6):  (1) ""ánna l7la dmìxe,} ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta.} ‘While they
      were asleep, the monk put his leg onto the leg of the woman.’ (A16:11)
  (2) lá y-ßal•xwa ˙átta ""ùmra} x†ì°5wa ßál6xwa sarkóle.} ‘When we went down
      to church, it was a sin to go bare-headed.’ (B10:44)
  (3) lá m>y•xwa gùða,} pal†•xwala óìta.} ‘When we shook the churn, we
      would take out the curds.’ (B10:9)
  (4) la-°éle rèš-ßàwma,} b-šaql•xwa kúlla ""amàn6n,} kùlla b-šaql•xwala} d7r6xwa
      q•†ma mxallêxwala.} ‘When the beginning of the (Lent) fast came, we
      would take all our vessels, we would take them all and put ash on
      them to clean them.’ (B16:7)
  (5) l7le mútt6lla ""áqle dìye}—ßáwl6t màlka} ""iw7wa dàwa}—mútt6lla rš-d-àn b6z-
      máre,} ""o-b6zmára xíla m6n-dàwa,} šqíla m6n-dàwa.} ‘When he placed his
      foot—the shoes of the king were made of gold—he placed them on
      the nails, the nail ate the gold, took some of the gold.’ (A14:28)
  (6) ""áyya másta la-q6m-daríla gu-d-aw-gùða,} . . . heš-t-là bráza,} xán‘i t-la-bráza
      m5°íwa xa-g•lla y-amríle sêrmo.} ‘When they have put the yoghurt in the
      churn . . . while it is not yet dry, shortly before it becomes dry, they
      would fetch a herb called s6rmo.’ (B14:1)Occasionally the construction is used to express the causal grounds for
the situation described in what follows, e.g.  (7) dúk°6 d-ó-g6ld6t tàwra,} l5le-wíða g•dda zòra,} xzi-k6má m>sà˙a dwíqle.}
      ‘Since he had made it into a fine thread, the place (enclosed by) the
      ox skin covered a great area.’ (A11:13)On sporadic occasions the negative construction expresses the background
of a preceding rather than following clause, e.g.
                               clause sequences                                  935  (8) maxíwale b-réš6t nàše,} kúlla ""áni là mbarxíwal5 qáša-w šamàša.} ‘They
      tapped it on the head of people, while the priest and the deacon
      blessed them all.’ (B16:24)18.2.2. Gapping of the Negator
When a negated clause is followed by one or more clauses that are negated
in sense and elaborate on the first clause, the negative particle la may be
gapped. This applies to all verbal forms, including imperatives (3):  (1) ""6n-háw5 ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ""axwá°ux hawnàne,} la-ma†étuwa l-àwwa l•xma,}
      ""u-""attítuwa láxxa p5šítuwa hátxa snìqe.} ‘If ten other men from ˇiyare
      were as intelligent as you, you would not have reached this (miser-
      able condition of begging for) bread and would not be sitting here,
      in such a needy state.’ (B17:16)
  (2) tùna d5r•xwale gáwe} qa-lá-ßaliwa míya ""êlt6x,} qa-t-ßáliwa míya hátxa b-rèš6n.}
      ‘We would put straw in it, so that water would not flow down, so
      that water would not flow down on our head.’
  (3) lá-wuð hàtxa} q†úl ""anna-bnón6 náše kùlla.} ‘Don’t do that, don’t kill all the
      people.’ (A29:17)In (4) the construction with the gapped negator is separated from the first
by an intervening imperative. The gapping explains why the ""i-qa†6l form
y-asq6n is used with future reference (< la-y-asq6n ‘I shall not go up’):  (4) l•mu lá-""asq6n ""àna?} hálli ˙àwla.} y-ásq6n kúlla q7se mj>mênna} ""u-""úrxa
      pa°xênna} qa-t-míya ßála qam-tar-gêppa?} ‘Why should I not go (alone)?
      Give me a rope. (Why should I not) gather all the wood and open up
      the way so that the water will come down to the door of the cave.’
      (A39:10)
                   18.3. Intonation Group BoundariesWhen presenting a series of connected main clauses, the speaker may
utter each clause in a separate intonation group, e.g.  (1) j•nne ""ê°yela,} šqìl6lla Zíne} nùbl6lla Jazíra Bóta.} ‘The jinn came and took
      Zine, took her away to Jazira Bota.’ (A26:8)
936                            chapter eighteen  (2) ""áwwa qím5le qedàmta,} šqíl6lle xa-m6n-sús6t xàle,} tíwa l-xáße dìye,} ""u-ßêlya.}
      ‘He got up in the morning, took one of his father’s horses, sat on
      its back and went down.’ (A25:40)
  (3) ""u-zìl5le,} mútt6lle réše dìye} dmìx5le.} ‘He went, put down his head and
      slept.’ (A25:43)
  (4) p7š6n xa-nêšra} t-yátw6n l-xàß6x} m†amrênn6x gu-""úpra.} ‘I shall become an
      eagle and sit on your back and bury you in the ground.’ (A25:63)In some cases more than one main clause is placed in the same intonation
group. This is found particularly with short verbal clauses, often consisting
of no more than the verbal form without any nominal complements. If
there are nominal complements, these tend to occur in the final clause.
   In general, the effect of placing two or more clauses together in the
same intonation group is to present the activities expressed by the clauses
as being closely related in that they can be interpreted as forming compo-
nents of a single overall event. The clauses of the series, moreover, usually
have the same subject. There is no formal syntactic subordination in the
form of subordinating particles and the verbs in the series are, in principle,
in the same form (e.g. q†ille, q†il5le etc.). There are, however, some formal
signals of dependence, which reflect their close cohesion. The initial verb,
for example, is combined directly with the following verbal clause in an
asyndetic paratactic construction rather than being linked with the con-
nective particle w, e.g.  (5) zílle qítle b-xa-†ùra.} ‘It went and hit a mountain.’ (A50:10)
  (6) táwra mítle npìlle táma.} ‘The ox died and collapsed there.’ (A22:9)In a series of compound verbal forms in narrative sequences a conspicu-
ous reflection of dependence is the omission of the copula element after
the first verb (§15.4.1.3., §15.4.2.3.), e.g.  (7) ""•°y5le tíwa b-dìw6n.} ‘He came and sat down in the reception room.’
      (A26:63)There is a particular tendency for the occurrence of prosodic bonding of
clauses in a single intonation group after certain verbs (§18.3.1.– §18.3.8.)
and in certain syntactic contexts (§18.3.9.– §18.3.11.).
                             clause sequences                             93718.3.1. qym
The basic meaning of this verb is ‘to get up’. When the verb occurs in a
separate intonation group, it frequently has this basic meaning, e.g.  (1) ""ay-qìmt5la,} wíðta qàwa.} ‘She got up and made coffee.’ (A26:31)
  (2) Mir-Zándin qìm5le} b8ye qa†êlle.} ‘Mir-Zandin got up and wanted to kill
      him.’ (A26:67)Also when combined with another verb in the same intonation group,
the interpretation of the verb as having its basic meaning is appropriate
in some contexts, e.g.  (3) xa-màlka} kút-yum ðà-brata gaw•rwa.} mbádla qay•mwa qa†êlwala.} ‘A king
      would marry a girl everyday. In the morning he would get up and kill
      her.’ (A14:1)In many cases, however, the verb is used with a less specific meaning and
functions as a general marker of the onset of an activity or situation. In
several cases the interpretation is ambiguous, since the onset of a series of
actions in narrative often could be interpreted as coinciding with the act of
‘getting up’. It is, indeed, this ambiguity that has led to the generalization
of its meaning. In some contexts, nevertheless, the verb clearly does not
admit being interpreted as denoting the physical act of ‘getting up’. It is
used, for example, before verbs denoting ‘sitting down’, e.g.  (4) qímela tìwela,} wíðela tàgbir.} ‘They sat down and made a plan.’ (A26:2)It is attested before verbs denoting states, non-dynamic activities or pas-
sive constructions in which the grammatical subject has no dynamic role
in the action, e.g.  (5) qím5le píš5le màjbur} M8mo dì‰5le.} ‘M>mo was forced to return.’ (A26:38)
  (6) ""u-qím5le mpúl†5le mu'àll6m.} ‘The teacher was then brought out.’
      (A22:41)When the verb qym acts as an onset marker, it is used to signal some kind
of boundary in the discourse, dividing the discourse into sections that
cohere together. In (7), for example, the construction occurs at the onset
of a section concerning the jinn. In (8) the act of replying to the letter
938                             chapter eighteenis presented as separate from that of capturing the dove and reading the
letter. In (9) the arrival at the mountain is presented as a shift in scene
and an episodic boundary. In (10) it occurs at the beginning of a narrative
section after direct speech. Note that here it coincides with the use of the
particle –≥i, which is also a boundary marker (§18.1.4.1.):  (7)  jênne} t-šmàyya} qímla wídla tàgbir.} ‘The jinn of heaven made a plan.’
       (A26:1)
  (8) S6ttíye zìlt5la} dwíqt6lla yáwna hàtxa,} šqìlt6lle.} k°áwa qrì°6lle.} ""u-qímt5la
       mjuwàbt6lle} ""u-yíwt6lle qa-yàwna.} ‘S6ttiye went and grabbed the dove
       like this and took it. She read the letter. She answered it and gave
       it to the dove.’ (A25:72)
  (9) qíma dart-yòma,} mj≥m6lla maymùne} ""u-xðìr5le.} qímela mê†yela} xa-†ùra.}
       ‘The next day he gathered the monkeys together and toured
       around. They arrived at a mountain.’ (A14:48)
  (10) m•re ""áti t-áz6t t-yátw6t t>màha.} ßáli šalxíla julléy t-yáwne tàmma.} ""áti
       xáz6t ""ày-m6nna b8y6t} šaql•tla ""ánna jùlle,} m5°êtla-lli} lítlux šùla.} ""áwwa-≥i
       qím5le ßêly5le.} ‘He said “You go and sit over there. They will go
       down and take off their doves’ clothes. See which one you like and
       take the clothes (belonging to her) and bring them to me, and all
       will be fine.” He went down.’ (A14:80–81)Prosodic bonding of the verb qym occurs in imperative and other deontic
constructions, e.g.  (11) qu-plú† m-àxxa!} ‘Get out of here!’ (A16:11)
  (12) qu-p7g6n kàde!} ‘Get up and bake kade cakes!’ (A30:41)
  (13) qu-šqúlla ""áyya skìnta!} ‘Take this knife!’ (A15:8)
  (14) qu-qálb6x b7°a biš-spày.} ‘Let’s return home—that’s better.’ (A30:55)In (15) the resultative participle qime is combined with imperative forms:  (15) qíme so-mˆ°ole ""6lli-díyi!} ‘Go and bring him to me!’ (A7:7)18.3.2. Verbs of Movement
These include verbs such as ""zl ‘to go’, ""°y ‘to come’, dy‰ ‘to return’, ßly ‘to
go down’, ""sq ‘to go up’, which are commonly bonded prosodically with
a following verb, e.g.
                                clause sequences                            939  (1)   S6ttíye zílla q6m-dawqàla. ‘S6ttiye went and grabbed it.’ (A25:72)
  (2)   zíl5le m•xya t9ra.} ‘He went and knocked at the door.’ (A14:28)
  (3)   ""u-°éle náša q6m-šaqêlle m•nnux.} ‘A man came and took it from you.’
        (A17:35)
  (4)   ""êdl5le} xa-bráta °í°5wa dmíxta kêsli.} ‘This night a girl came and slept
        with me.’ (A26:11)
  (5)   dí‰‰e ""o-qamáya q6m-qa†•lle ""o-sàwa.} ‘The first man returned and killed
        the old man.’
  (6)   ""u-dí‰5le ß•ly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na.} ‘He went back down to the spring.’
        (A26:32)
  (7)   ""áxni †la-mò ßál6x ""áxni mpal†•xle?} ‘Why should we go down and
        release him?’ (A26:77)
  (8)   síqle wírre k6s-bràta.} ‘He went up and entered the girl’s home.’
        (A17:24)Examples with imperatives:  (9) sa-dùqla ""ayya-yáwna!} ‘Go and grab that dove!’ (A25:72)
  (10) d6-háyyo sxà!} ‘Come and swim!’ (A25:61)
  (11) ßli-mur-""êlle} ‘Go down and say to him . . .’ (A26:37)When the verbs ßly ‘to go down’ or ""sq ‘to go up’ occur in a tight sequence
to a preceding verb, the sequences can often be rendered idiomatically
by English phrasal verbs containing the elements ‘down’ and ‘up’ respec-
tively, e.g.  (12) zadéle ßàle} gu-xa-‘ále gò‰ta.} ‘He threw him down into a big pit.’
       (A22:40)
  (13) kút-yum xá-""6rw6n y-ar•qwa y-ás6q qám d-o-dèwa.} ‘Every day one of
       our sheep would run up to that wolf.’ (A10:5)18.3.3. mßy/ ""mß ‘to be able’
When used in a past perfective form (mßele, m6ßy5le), this verb is often com-
bined asyndetically in a paratactic relation with the verb that is dependent
on it, in that the second verb is put in a past perfective form (q†ille, q6m-
qa†6l, q†il5le), e.g. mßele °ele ‘He was able to come’. The same applies to
negated clauses, e.g. la mßele °ele ‘He could not come’, la mßele q6m-""aw6dla
‘He could not do it’. The second verb in a negative construction is seman-
tically irrealis, since the action did not take place. In principle, therefore,
940                          chapter eighteenan irrealis form would be expected. The use of the realis perfective form
has apparently arisen by morphological attraction. This, no doubt, is the
background also of the positive construction. The majority of examples
from the text corpus are negated or occur in interrogative clauses:  (1) là-mßeli mu°yáli.} ‘I could not bring her.’ (A8:55)
  (2) ""áyya bàxta} lá-mßela mxumˆla ""•rwe.} ‘The woman could not keep the
      sheep.’ (A10:6)
  (3) la-mßél6n s•ql6n ßˆda.} ‘We could not go up to hunt.’ (A26:46)
  (4) lá-mßeli zrìli.} ‘I could not cultivate.’ (A30:13)
  (5) l7la-m6ßye wíðe ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘They could not do anything.’ (A8:65)
  (6) dáx mßéle ""áyya bráta q6m-""aw•dla b-p6lxán6t bˆ°a?} ‘How could he have
      made this girl a hard-working housewife?’ (A21:32)
  (7) ""ánna tre-yále m8nile m•ßya d6ry•lla gu-šaqì°a?} ‘Who could have put these
      two children in the stream?’ (A8:15)When the verb mßy/ ""mß is in the qa†6l form, expressing the present or
future, the complement verb is in the irrealis form, sometimes introduced
by the subordinating particle D, e.g.  (8) máß6x t-àmr6x} ‘We can say’ (B4:3)In (9) a perfective past verb is followed by another perfective verb but the
latter is introduced by the subordinating particle D:  (9) bráta làn-m6ßya t-in-mú°y6lla.} ‘I could not bring back the girl.’ (A29:8)18.3.4. ßbr ‘to dare’
A similar paratactic joining is found after perfective forms of ßbr ‘to dare’,
e.g. ßbirre °ele ‘He dared to come’, la ßbirre °ele ‘He did not dare to come’.
The examples attested in the text corpus are negated:  (1) ""áp-xa m•nna lá-ßbirre rhíwle gu-dìw6n.} ‘Nobody dared to speak in the
      reception room.’ (A26:70)
  (2) lá ßbírra mßuwêtla.} ‘She did not dare to speak.’ (A24:40)
                              clause sequences                                941The irrealis form is also attested after the perfective past, e.g.  (3) ""áp-xa lá-ßbirre ""asêqle.} ‘Nobody dared to go up (and do) it.’ (A33:4)18.3.5. qbl ‘to permit’
The verb qbl ‘to permit’ may be used in a similar syntactic structure. In
the following example from the text corpus it is negated:  (1) ""áw là-qbille °éli.} ‘He did not permit me to come.’ (A46:3)18.3.6. šry II ‘to begin’
This verb is normally followed by an infinitive (§15.5.5.). When, however,
it is in a perfective past form, it is sometimes followed by a perfective form
of the verb linked to it paratactically in the same intonation group, e.g.  (1) šuréle zmírre b-súsa smòqa.} ‘He started singing to a brown horse.’
      (A25:11)
  (2) šuréla xrì†la.} ‘She started to gouge it out.’ (A19:6)
  (3) šúryela xílela m-©ðàðe.} ‘They began to eat together.’ (A21:21)18.3.7. prq ‘to finish’
Similarly, the verb prq ‘to finish’ is sometimes combined together with a
verb in the same intonation group, e.g.  (1) bar-príqla kúlla náše šqílla ""arz?q.} ‘After all the people had finished tak-
      ing provisions . . .’ (B17:12)18.3.8. pyš majbur ‘to become obliged’
This expression is used to express an obligation and is often prosodically
bonded with the following verb, which expresses the lexical content of
the action, e.g.  (1) páy6š májbur béna xaráya šàte.} ‘In the end it will be forced to drink.’
      (A12:47)
  (2) píš5le májbur ßêly5le.} ‘He had to dismount.’ (A28:33)
942                             chapter eighteen18.3.9. Cirumstantial Clauses
When a clause is dependent on another clause by virtue of the fact that
it expresses the circumstances of the action of the other clause, this
dependence is often expressed prosodically by combining the two clauses
in the same intonation group, e.g.  (1) kúlla ""•°ye ""itléy š>rá†e t-amríla qa-màlka.} ‘They had all come while hav-
      ing cases to present to the king.’ (A17:31)
  (2) hadíya b8ye t-áx6l m•ndi kpìn5le.} ‘Now he wanted to eat something,
      since he was hungry.’ (A30:11)
  (3) ""u-sulámm6š doqíle lóši xa-jùlla.} ‘They would hold the hive whilst wear-
      ing a cloth.’ (B5:178)18.3.10. Temporal Adverbial Clauses
Similarly, prosodic bonding between main clauses is often used when one
clauses supplies the temporal adverbial setting of the action of the fol-
lowing clause. In such cases the first clauses is idiomatically translated by
supplying a temporal particle such as ‘after’ or ‘when’, e.g.  (1) barzíwa xá‘‘a mkal‘ìwala.} ‘(After) they (the logs) had dried a little, they
      would remove their bark.’ (B5:187)
  (2) hadíya mkop•šla ßlèla.} ‘Now (after) they had gathered it, they went
      down (to the plain).’ (A7:15)
  (3) b>láwala yabíšta x6rqá x6rqá gu-qðála díya mabyênwa.} ‘(When) she swal-
      lowed a raisin, it could be seen, ring by ring in her neck.’ (A8:63)
  (4) m†éle mo°7°6lle xá‘‘a mìya.} ‘(When) he came, she brought some water.’
      (A22:28)
  (5) hátta Gozáli b-gáne mšudr•tle lˆn °í°a.} ‘Even (when) you sent Gozali
      himself, I did not come.’ (A8:94)18.3.11. Complement of a Clause Constituent
Another context in which clauses occur in a single intonation group due
to their semantic connection is where the second clause functions as a
complement of a constituent in the first clause. In (1), for example, the
second clause should be analysed as the complement of the noun ""urxa
‘way’ (‘the way she learnt’):
                               clause sequences                                943  (1) dáx ""úrxa muxzélux ""•lla lípla ""àwwa šúla?} ‘How did you show her the
      way to learn this work?’ (A21:34)This applies also to clauses that are formally marked as subordinate by
by the particle D. When these are direct complements of a verb, they are
typically in the same intonation group as the verb, e.g.  (2) ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
  (3) b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
  (4) máß6x t-àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B4:3)If, however, the subordinate clause is not integrated into the main clause
as the complement of a constituent, but rather is a complement of the
clause as a whole and so is external to it, this looser relationship is some-
times expressed by putting the subordinate clause in a separate intonation
group, e.g.  (5) ""ána paqðênn5xu} t-azítu b-""úrxa ma†ítu ""êlla.} ‘I shall instruct you, so that
      you go on the road and reach her.’ (A8:27)
    18.4. Repetition of Clauses to Mark a Discourse BoundarySome types of repetition across clauses have been described already in
relation to the connective particles (cf. §18.1.1., §18.1.2.). A further type
of repetitive overlap across clauses is described in this section.
   In narrative the narrator sometimes repeats the mention of an event that
has already been narrated before recounting the event that is sequential
to it. The informational status of the clause, therefore, may be compared
to that of a topical referent. The purpose of ‘heavy’ coding of topical
information at the front of a sentence is generally to mark some kind of
boundary in the narrative. This is, indeed, the function of the construc-
tion under discussion since it is used to signal the onset of a section. It is
a device used by the narrator to present an activity as a new event with
a degree of independence from what precedes. This is usually a result
of the subjective choice of the speaker as to how the narrative should be
staged. The function of this construction is similar to that of subordinate
‘when’–clauses (§19.3.3.) and, indeed, they are often idiomatically rendered
by supplying ‘when’ in an English translation. Examples:
944                              chapter eighteen  (1) kúlla twìre qðaléy,} mì°ela.} mì°ela,} ""áwwa rìq5le,} ß•ly5le m†ùšy6lla gáne.}
      ‘They all broke their necks and died. (When) they died, he fled, went
      down and hid himself.’ (B18:6)
  (2) xà-yoma} sìqle} l-ßˆda,} tfìqle} xa-""àrya bíye díye.} tfíqle xa-""àrya bíye díye,}
      zílle †ál6b ""àrya.} ‘One day he went out hunting and a lion chanced
      to come his way. (When) a lion chanced to come his way, he went
      to attack the lion.’ (A27:3)
  (3) qímle q6m-†arêdle.} q6m-†ar•dle °éle zìlle} be-""ámte dìye.} ‘He drove him
      away. (When) he drove him away, he went back to his aunt’s house.’
      (A23:32–33)
  (4) zílla q6m-qa†làla} Šóš6t Xère,} q6m-m†amrála gu-""òr6t sus>wá°a ""•lt6x.} q6m-
      m†amrála gu-""ór6t sus>wà°a,} bróna díya °èle.} ‘She went and killed Šoš6t
      Xere and buried her in the horses’ manger below. (When) she buried
      her in the horses’ manger, her son came back.’ (A38:3–4)The repeated material is in some cases uttered with a different distribution
of stress either across the words of a stress group (5) or within a single
word (6):  (5) map6rxálux šawwà yamá°a,} má†6t l-d-o-qàßra.} má†6t l-d-ò-qaßra,} háw6t
      h•šy6r ""ína ""áyya sústa là marp•tla.} ‘She will fly you over the seven seas
      and you will reach that palace. (When) you arrive at that palace, be
      careful not to let that horse go.’ (A12:29)
  (6) ""u-m•†y5le qam-d-o-†ùra.} m6†y7le qam-d-o-†ùra,} xirˆle,} mùjb5le.} ‘He
      arrived in front of the mountain. He arrived in front of the moun-
      tain, he looked and was amazed.’ (A8:53)In cases where long morphological variants are available, the long form
is used either in the first clause or in the repeated clause. This can be
regarded as two alternative strategies whereby a heavy morphological
form is used as a boundary marker to signal either closure or onset. In
(7) the first clause has a long form of pronominal suffix on the resultative
participle to mark closure (§15.13.5.), whereas the repeated clause has the
shorter, default form. In (8), on the other hand, the long variant of the
imperative is used in the repeated clause:  (7) ""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} p°íxt6lle t9ra,} xzí°6lle bába dìya} ""u-""up-w8zīr
      mênne.} ‘While there was flour on her hands, she opened the door.
      She opened the door and saw her father and also the vizier who was
      with him.’ (A21:26)
                                clause sequences                                    945  (8)   só l-b7°6t flàn-naša.} sógun l-b7°6t flàn-naša,} ""u-š•qlula ""an-trè-yale,} ""u-

        house of such-and-such a man, and take away the two children.
        Get rid of them.’ (A8:8)In (9)–(11) the repeated clause has more lexical material than the first
clause. This again can be viewed as a strategy of using linguistic ballast
to mark a boundary, which should be interpreted as the onset of what
follows. In (9) the repeated clause also exhibits the use of the long alter-
native form of the 3pl. suffix -l5y (cf. §15.12.):  (9)  ""í°wa xá-n>ra tàma.} kut-táwra m•xy6lle xá gu-réše dìye,} gu-be-""7ne

       them they should do. They went off. The police went off at night
       and took the two children from their father and mother.’ (A8:9)
                          18.5. Intonation PatternsThe relationship between clauses is also signalled by the pitch contours
associated with the nuclear stress in an intonation group. By means of
intonation contours the speaker conveys to the hearer a wide range of
signals, some of which belong to levels of expression that have no direct
correlations in linguistic structure, such as numerous personal attitudes.
For this reason it was decided not to mark the intonational pitch contours
in the transcription of the texts. Here we shall restrict ourselves to a
brief examination of some of the main intonational signals, with special
attention to those that mark semantic continuity and discontinuity across
946                         chapter eighteenclauses. The semantic connection between clauses is an issue that has
been discussed in numerous places in the foregoing discussion of syntactic
structure.
   We may distinguish two basic types of intonational contours that
are relevant for the present discussion, namely a contour expressing
disjunction and one expressing conjunction. Following the terminology that
is customary in the field of intonation, we may refer to these as ‘major
juncture’ and ‘minor juncture’ respectively.","[971, 972, 973, 974, 975, 976, 977, 978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985]"
"15.4.2.2. Progressive Function
The infinitive may be combined with the deictic copula, the basic copula
or the negative copula. When the basic copula is used, this is in its enclitic
form. As has been shown in §15.3.1–§15.3.2., the enclitic basic copula
and the deictic copula are used with predicates expressing either contin-
gent or permanent properties but the independent basic copula is used
only with predicates expressing permanent properties that, typically, are
intrinsic to the nature of the subject referent and have not been acquired.
As will be shown below, the infinitive compound construction expresses
a transient activity that is not a permanent property of the subject and
so it is in principle not appropriate to use the independent copula in the
construction.
                            the syntax of verbs                            705   The basic function of the infinitive compound construction is to express
progressive aspect, i.e. it denotes an activity that is taking place at the
present moment but is not necessarily a permanent, habitual property of
the subject of the verb.
   In positive clauses the deictic or enclitic copula may be used with the
infinitive. The copula may also be omitted altogether. In principle these
three different constructions are used by the speaker to endow the clause
with varying degrees of communicative salience. This salience scale may
be represented as follows, in which the construction with the deictic copula
is highest in salience and the form with no copula is lowest:     hole q†ala     > q†al5le       >       q†alaIn negative clauses only two degrees of communicative salience are
expressed, one with the negative copula and one with the negative par-
ticle la alone:     l5le q†ala     > la q†alaThe degree of salience depends on various factors. One consideration is
the factivity of the proposition. Clauses expressing assertive, factive proposi-
tions are high in communicative salience in that the speaker is committed
to its factuality. Non-factive propositions do not involve such commitment
and are low in communicative salience. This is reflected by the fact that
the deictic copula is normally used with the infinitive in conversation
when the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to an activity that
exists in the current speech situation, e.g. hole °aya ‘He is coming’. In inter-
rogative clauses, on the other hand, the enclitic copula is used, e.g. °ay5le?
‘Is he coming?’ In negative main clauses there is no formal distinction
between assertive and interrogative propositions: l5le °aya ‘He is not com-
ing’, l5le °aya? ‘Is he not coming?’ Examples from the text corpus:  (1) hóla ßláya r6š-""ˆna.} ‘She is going down to the spring.’ (A26:40)
  (2) hon-wáða ""ixàla.} ‘I am making food.’ (A21:27)
  (3) hóla dwáqa nàše.} ‘They are seizing people.’ (A25:80)
  (4) ""áti hot-wáða xákma šulàne} báxta m6n-gáw‰a hot-šqàl6lla} ""u-hot-baróx6lla
      l-gànux.} ‘You are doing (bad) things, you are taking a woman from
      her husband and wedding her to yourself.’ (A25:81)
  (5) dúnye hóla ràya.} ‘It is raining.’ (A26:46)
  (6) †8y6t xòn6x?} ‘Are you searching for your brother?’ (A8:64)
  (7) hár-dwaq6t rêqqi?} ‘Are you still insisting?’ (A40:4)
706                           chapter fifteen  (8)   ""u-""èdyo ""áti lat-wáða b-xàbri.} ‘Today you are not doing as I said (you
        should).’ (A22:43)
  (9)   lat-mtaxmóne m6n-nàše?} ‘Are you not thinking of the people?’
        (A25:60)Another factor that contributes to communicative salience is the actional-
ity of the verb. Verbs that have a non-dynamic actionality, which express
mental processes rather than perceptible activities, exhibit a greater ten-
dency to have the enclitic copula when being used with progressive aspect
than do verbs with a dynamic actionality, with which the deictic copula
is used to a greater degree, e.g.  (10) b-xšáw6n gáw‰i °èle.} ‘I think my husband has returned.’ (A39:18)
  (11) ""ana-txár6n y-a°7wa xo-tú°a óùwa.} ‘I remember they would come (and
       sit) under the smooth mulberry tree.’ (B5:203)
  (12) ""ána xzáy6n ""an-maymúne . . . hóla xál6lla q†àl6lla.} ‘I see that they are
       eating and killing the monkeys.’ (A14:52)
  (13) zdàl6x.} ‘We are afraid.’ (A14:40)
  (14) pšàm6n rába.} ‘I am very sorry.’ (A1:11)
  (15) ""ána mštawhór6n m-bnòni.} ‘I am proud of my children.’The degree of communicative salience also depends on the nature of the
grammatical subject. In some expressions with impersonal subjects the
infinitive is used without a copula. This applies to the verb m-byn ‘to
appear’, e.g.  (16) mabyóne †úra gu-‘ól ramàn5le.} ‘It seems it is a high mountain in the
       countryside.’ (A8:70)
  (17) mabyóne ""ì°-xa-m6ndi gu-qèßß6t.} ‘It appears that there is something in
       the story.’ (A4:18)Note also the regular omission of the copula on the infinitive in meteo-
rological expressions such as dunye raya ‘It is raining’ or raya talga ‘It is
snowing. The grammatical subject dunye (literally: ‘the world’) refers to
the general situation.
   For some of the verbs expressing mental processes the qa†6l form is
often used to express the progressive aspect rather than the infinitive
construction. This applies to the verbs by ‘to want’, yð"" ‘to know’, zd""/zdl
‘to fear’, ßbr ‘to dare’, mßy / ""mß ‘to be able’ and xzy ‘to see’ (§15.1.1.4.).
The infinitive construction is used in some circumstances to express the
                              the syntax of verbs                                707progressive, but its distribution differs with each verb. It is rarely used at
all with by ‘to want, to like’. With zd"" ‘to fear’ and xzy ‘to see’ it is used
interchangeably with the qa†6l form. With the verbs yð"", and mßy there is
a tendency to use it with negated forms of the verb rather than positive
forms. Examples from the text corpus:  (18) hon-b9y6llux,} t-amrênnux.} ‘I like you so I shall tell you.’ (A14:78)
  (19) lˆla b8y6lle?} ‘Doesn’t she want it?’ (A30:32)
  (20) ""ána ""êllux-in zdá""a.} ‘I am afraid for you.’ (B9:27)
  (21) l5n-zdá""a ""ap-d6ndêk°a.} ‘I am not afraid, even a little.’ (B9:17)
  (22) xzáy6t "">náha naše-t-íla ráqa bà°ri?} ‘Do you see those people who are
       running after me?’ (A7:17)
  (23) l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
       (A17:2)
  (24) làn-ða""a l7k5la zílta.} ‘I do not know where she has gone.’ (A26:11)
  (25) lát-ða""a ""o-""ˆnile?} ‘Do you not know who that is?’ (B15:81)
  (26) lán-mßaya jwàja.} ‘I cannot move.’ (A24:2)
  (27) lán-mßaya mattánna b-""ìði.} ‘I cannot put it on my hand.’ (A26:21)A further factor that affects the communicative salience of the infinitive
construction is its information status. This is reflected in the tendency for
the enclitic copula rather than the deictic copula to be used when the
verbal form is low in information value and the main information focus
is on its complement. This is seen in (28) in which the verb xðár6n ‘I am
going around, I am searching’ in the answer to the question is presup-
posed to be known to the hearer, the main point of the utterance being
the complement ‘after my sustenance’, which indicates the purpose of
the bear’s action:  (28) ""o-tèla} mère há lˆk6t zála,} ya-gáni dêbba?} b-álaha xðár6n bá°6r rêsqi.} ‘The
       fox said “Hey, where are you going, my dear bear?” ‘By God, I’m
       going around (searching) after my sustenance.’ (A20:1)The compound infinitive is used to express a continuing situation that has
been in existence for a specified period of time. Such constructions are
translated by the English present perfect, e.g.  (29) ""u-""ána ""anna-šawwá-š6nne hon-°àya.} ‘I have been travelling (literally:
       coming) for these (last) seven years.’ (A37:17)
708                             chapter fifteen15.4.2.3. Function in Narrative
The infinitive construction is used in narrative discourse. In such contexts
the infinitive has either the deictic, the enclitic copula or the copula is
omitted altogether.
   When the deictic copula is used with the infinitive in narrative contexts,
the construction generally has its usual progressive sense. Its function is
to express an event that is in progress and overlaps temporally with an
adjacent punctual event. It is negated in the usual way by the negative
copula. The copula takes the past time reference of the adjacent narrative
as its deictic centre. The construction may be placed after the verb(s) with
which it overlaps temporally. It may have the same subject referent as the
preceding verb (1–2) or a different subject referent (3–5), e.g.  (1) plí†5le zíl5le hóle gašòqe.} ‘He went out, went off, watching.’ (A22:24)
  (2) zílle kléle xóðe t>màha.} har-hóle xyára b-ó-Äab6t ""6ngl6znàya.} hóle zdà""a.}
      ‘He went to stand alone far away. He kept looking at that English
      officer. He was afraid.’ (B17:13)
  (3) sìqt5la,} ""o-pà‰a} hóle mbarbòre,} har-mbarbòre,} l7le klàya.} ‘She went up,
      while the lamb bleated and bleated, incessantly.’ (A34:28)
  (4) ""è°y5le xá-naša xèna,} lwíša lwíšta smòqta,} súsa smòqa,} rúmxa smòqta.} b-l7le
      rúmxe díye hóla mxáya kizêkke,} ma-t-íle ""o-náša ràba x5làna.} ‘Another man
      came, dressed in red clothing, with a red horse, a red spear. In the
      night his spear was giving off sparks, so powerful was that man.’

      to receive the king, as they (customarily) receive kings, with honour,
      while she was watching, peering like this to see her betrothed, but
      she does not see him.’ (A4:35)The construction with the deictic copula is used to express an event that
is discovered to be in progress on the arrival on the scene of a character
in the narrative, e.g.  (6) ßêly5le} ""ína M8mo-w Zìne} hóla nšáqa ©ðàðe.} ‘He came down and (found)
      M>mo and Zine kissing each other.’ (A26:46)
  (7) ""ína xazèla} Zíne-w M9mo} hóla mê-©ðaðe mßawó°e.} ‘He sees Zine and
      M>mo while they were speaking with one another.’ (A26:57)

ing simultaneously, but rather the overall event expressed by the series of
individual events is presented as temporally overlapping with the main

        your business.” What was Be≥6m doing? He was holding the top
        of a poplar tree and bending it down, young children were com-
        ing and going up the poplar, he was letting the top of the poplar
        go, the poplar was springing up and he was flinging the young
        children in all directions. Rustam said “Nephew, don’t do that.” ’
        (A29:15–17)The infinitive construction with a deictic copula may denote an ongo-
ing event that overlaps temporally with a resultant state expressed by a
resultative participle, e.g.  (9)  ""ánna ßàli} ""ína mò ßáli!} hóla sus>wà°a} jêmye b-réše díye} wáða hêlma} b-
       réše dìye.} ‘They went down but what (a surprise when) they went

       wáða tàgbir.} ‘He was on the other side. He had put up a mosquito
       net and was lying there, pretending to be asleep, while they were
       making a plan.’ (A30:42)The construction with the deictic copula is used in a section of discourse
that presents a preliminary section that provides the background against
which a following series of punctual events in the foreground of the nar-
rative take place. In (11), for example, the forms hóla nšàq6lle and hóla spára
occur in a section of discourse that sets the scene for the main foreground
710                             chapter fifteenevent of the passage, namely that one of the angels sneezed because of
the soot. It is noteworthy that the resultative participles in this preliminary
background section also have the deictic copula (§15.4.1.3.):  (11) ""o-yála zóra hóla mútt6lle be-pàlga.} ""áy hóla nšàq6lle,} nšàq6lle,} nšàq6lle,}

       the middle. She is kissing and kissing and kissing him and hug-
       ging him to her breast. Then she gives him to his father. He also
       kisses and kisses and kisses him. The angels have come and have
       sat by the window. They are waiting by the window for the time
       to finish, for them to put down the child so that they could take
       away their soul. There were stoves in our community that were
       smoke ducts. Some of the soot went up and entered the nose of
       one of the angels. He went “achoo!” He sneezed.’ (A4:58–60)The infinitive construction is often used in narrative with a perfective
aspect to express an event that is sequential to what precedes. In such cases
the infinitive generally has the enclitic copula or the copula is omitted
altogether. Aspect, therefore, is a further factor that conditions the type
of copula marking on the construction.
   The copula is typically omitted in a chain of clauses expressing closely
knit events after the subject of the verb chain has been identified by the
copula in the first clause. The copula is used when there is a change in
subject referent. This can be seen in examples (12)–(14) below. It should
be noted that the infinitive with a 3rd person enclitic copula followed by
a 3rd person pronominal suffix is identical in form to the equivalent con-
struction without the copula (e.g. q†al6lle < q†al5le + -6lle or q†ala + -6lle). The
presence of the copula cannot, therefore, be discerned in these forms.  (12) yóm6 †¬à°a} már5le xóne díye xá-ga xéta ""o-t-Bàb6l} yáw6lle xábra †la-náše

       He killed also her. He went down. He had a servant. He handed
       over his horse to the servant. He entered his tent and slept until
       morning. In the morning they got up . . . They said “Wake Barz6kko!
       For how long will he sleep?” They woke him . . . and went on their
       way. They went a long way and arrived at an orchard. . . . Another
       man arrived.’ (A12:6–9)On some occasions a chain of clauses opens with an infinitive without the
copula when the subject is identifiable from the context and the opening
clause is closely connected semantically with what precedes. This is the
case, for example, in (15), in which the infinitive chain begins after direct
speech:  (15) hállule xa-sùsa.} tèmm6l mbádla ""àz6l.} šqála dárt-yoma xà-susa} táwa xáße
       díye zàla.} ‘ “Give him a horse. Let him go tomorrow morning.” ’
       The next day he took a horse, sat on its back and went off.’
       (A12:59–60)In some tightly knit verb sequences two infinitives are juxtaposed with
the copula on the second one, reflecting the fact that they are treated
as a single unit. This is attested where the first verb is qym (16) or a verb
of movement (17), or where two verbs of similar meaning are juxta-
posed (18):  (16) qyáma sàq5la.} ‘They rise and go up.’ (A13:1)
  (17) ráqa °ày5le.} ‘He runs and comes back.’ (A29:50)
712                            chapter fifteen  (18) ‘ar‘óre ""u-ßráx5la ë6nn6kˆra} ‘She screams and cries all around.’
       (A51:15)We should include here the use by narrators of the infinitive form mára
without a copula at various points in the text. The literal meaning of this is
‘It says’, the subject being the story itself. It is sequential to what precedes,
in that it marks an advance of the narrative. The narrator typically inserts
this formula at the beginning of new episodic sections, especially where
there is a change in spatio-temporal location. It is more idiomatically
translated into English by a discourse connective such as ‘now’, e.g.  (19) mára yóm6t trè} ""ay-là xílla.} ‘Now the next day she did not eat.’
       (A21:14)
  (20) mára qìm5le} qédamta híw5le xàbra.} ‘Now, the next day he gave word.’

       went down to the spring. He saw some girls there.’ (A26:23)
  (22) mára qím5le ""è°ya síqa l-gàre.} ‘Now, he came and he went up onto
       the roof.’ (A26:40)
  (23) mára Qára Té≥din zìl5le,} yíw6lla ""íðe gu-""íð6t M9mo.} ‘Now, Qara Te≥din
       went and put his hand in the hand of M>mo.’ (A26:50)On some occasions an infinitive construction that functions as a narrative
present with a perfective aspect has a deictic copula. In such cases the
intention of the speaker is to draw particular attention to the event in
question for some reason. The construction sometimes expresses an event
that was unexpected as a sequel to the preceding event. In (24) and (25),
for example, the speaker is astounded by what another character in the
narrative said after the event that is reported in the preceding clause. The
event of the horse bolting in (26) is also a sudden, unanticipated event. In
(27) the deictic copula signals the extraordinary action of the hero, which
ordinary men would not have been expected to carry out.  (24) ""è°y6x xa-néra benà°6n} hóle màra} bábi t-óð6xle gêšra.} mèri m-7ka

       ‘All those who went down there could not defeat him and he killed
       them. Rustam was a mighty warrior.’ (A29:60)The deictic copula is also found where the narrator wishes to express some
kind of boundary in the narrative. This may coincide with a shift in scene
and subject referent. In (28), for example, the narrator shifts attention to
the character Be≥6m at a different location in the village. The chain of
sequential clauses recounting his activities opens with an infinitive with a
deictic copula. Subsequent events in the scene that are expressed by the
infinitive construction have the enclitic copula or zero copula. In (29) the
attention shifts to the character Zine in a different location from that of
the preceding narrative. The adverbial ""axxa ‘over here’ is used by the
narrator to indicate a shift in scene. The clause expressing the opening
event of this scene has a deictic copula (hola †laba). The following clause,
which can be considered to be an elaboration of the first, also has the
deictic copula (hola mara). In (30) the clause with the deictic copula coin-
cides with a change in subject. This clause may also be interpreted as the
resumption of the main narrative foreground, the two preceding clauses
being a preliminary background section. In (31) the speaker narrates the
events of a dream. The deictic copula is used to mark the crossing of
the bridge as a boundary in the discourse, presenting it as the onset of a
chain of clauses that constitute a distinct overall event from what precedes.
The clause is also presented as a new section of direct speech. Similarly
in (32) the speaker uses the deictic copula to present the series of clauses
narrating the second attempt to fire the bullets as a separate overall event
from what precedes.","[743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750, 751, 752]"
"15.1.1.5. Deontic Future (Irrealis)
Among the various forms of irrealis expressed by the qa†6l form is deontic
modality. In such cases while occurring in a main clause without being
subordinated to another verb, it conveys an element of will and expresses
various degrees of intention, obligation, request, and permission regarding
a future action. In this function the verb in principle has perfective aspect.
In most cases it presents the action as a complete event with a start and
endpoint. Sometimes it does not have a clearly delimited endpoint, but it
must have a start point future to the present moment.
   Main clause verbs in the first person used in a deontic function gener-
ally express the intention of the speaker, e.g.  (1)   ""áz6n ""óð6n qáz6d d-àwwa gèppa.} ‘I shall go and make towards this
        cave.’ (A39:3)
  (2)   ""ána q7m6n ""áz6n ""ùmra.} ‘I shall go to church.’ (A37:2)
  (3)   ""ána har-ßál6n mðìta} m7°6n ""ixàla} ""u-""à°ena.} ‘I shall just go down to
        the town to bring food and shall come back.’ (A26:30)In the verb ""mr ‘to say’ the modality can be interpreted as expressing either
intention or a request for permission from the hearer:  (4)   ""amrênn6x xá-m6ndi.} ‘I shall tell you something./Let me tell you
        something.’ (A4:15)
  (5)   ""amrèxlux xà-mdi xéna.} ‘We shall tell you something else./Let us tell
        you something else.’ (A39:8)Questions in the qa†6l forms such as (6–9) are deontic expressions whereby
the speaker addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation
(deontic necessity) or give permission (deontic possibility):

  (8)   mó ""àw6ð?} ‘What should/can he do?’ (A28:20)
  (9)   lˆka ""azéxi?} ‘Where should we go?’ (A26:18)Such questions in the 1st person can be transposed into the 3rd person
in indirect questions, e.g.  (10) l7ðe gu-d-7ni kúrsi ""àtu.} ‘He does not know in which chair he should
       sit.’ (A40:14)
  (11) l7ði mò ""áwði.} ‘They do not know what they should do.’Deontic qa†6l forms in the 2nd and 3rd person express a variety of types
of will on the part of the speaker, including request, recommendation
and permission, e.g.  (12) ""áxtu kúll5xu ""azítu bˆ°a.} ‘All of you should go home.’ (A8:85)
  (13) yába hàyyo,} ""a°ìtu.} ‘ìdetu.} ‘Come, you (are requested to) come. You
       are invited.’ (A7:3)
  (14) ""ámr6t †la-màlka.} ‘You should say to the king . . .’ (A1:6)
  (15) ""áz6t táwrux p5rmêtle.} ‘You should go and slaughter your ox.’ (A7:2)
  (16) xúwwe ""áz6l dúke dìye.} ‘Let the snake go to its place.’ (A1:8)
  (17) xà-bena ""ázi náše.} ‘People should go (only) once.’ (B15:91)
  (18) kút-yom pál†6t ""u-xàðr6t,} ""áß6rta ""á°6t bˆ°a.} ‘Every day go out and wan-
       der about and then in the evening come back home.’ (A14:62)
  (19) hàtxa ""oðéti b-náše!} ‘This is what you should do to people!’ (A22:47)This type of deontic qa†6l may occur in indirect speech in a subordinate
clause, e.g.  (20) múr †la-xòn6x} qa-t ""êdyo} ""áwði tàgbir} ""ásqi l-ßˆda.} ‘Tell your brother
       that today they should make a plan to go out hunting.’ (A26:43)The use of the form to express iterative actions as in (18) and (19) above
can be accommodated in the interpretation of it as a perfective form, in
that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each individual
perfective occurrence of the iterated situation.
  The various deontic expressions described above can be negated, e.g.
576                          chapter fifteen  (21) ""ána là-""a°6n mènnux.} ‘I shall not come with you.’ (A6:6)
  (22) là-""awr6n gu-má°a.} ‘I shall not go into the village.’ (A25:34)
  (23) là-mßaw°6t!} ‘Do not speak!’ (A26:89)
  (24) là-daqr6t bíye.} ‘Do not touch him.’ (A26:74)

  (27) ""áp-xa la-jáw6j m6n-gu-""Amedìa.} ‘Let nobody move from Amedia.’
       (A25:27)Deontic qa†6l forms may be preceded by various preverbal particles:(i) xoš
The particle xoš is in origin the imperative of the verb rxš ‘to go’. It is
most frequently attested with verbs with 3rd person subjects, though it
can be used with all persons. Examples:  (28) ""u-b7°ux xoš-""àq6ð} ‘and may your house burn down.’ (A17:6)
  (29) xoš-""á°a ""àp-anna} ‘Let them also come back.’ (B8:4)
  (30) bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘But let my eye, which saw
       her, go to hell.’ (A16:2)
  (31) ku-mèndi b8yi xoš-""òði.} ‘Let them do whatever they want.’ (A14:46)
  (32) xoš-""áw6r ""u-""áx6l ""u-šáte gu-p6rdˆsa-w} ‘Let him enter and eat and
       drink in Paradise.’ (A2:8)
  (33) kúlla xoš-dàmxi.} ‘Let everybody sleep.’ (A14:56)
  (34) ""áx‘i xoš-qày6m} xazyánne xàmša daqíqe.} ‘Let him rise for me to see
       him for only five minutes.’ (A4:49)
  (35) suràye} xoš-""ámr6x ""ánna ""ùrze,} xà b-nošéy} ""u-""i-zamríwa ràwe.} ‘The
       Christians, let’s say the men, by themselves, would sit in a recep-
       tion room and sing rawe.’ (B15:75)It is placed before the negative particle la in negative deontic expressions,
e.g.  (36) xóš la-""à°e!} ‘Let him not come!’(ii) d6-, de-
The particle d6-/de- may be related to the adverbial particle diya ‘now’. It
is more frequently attested as a prefix to imperative forms than to deontic
qa†6l forms.

  (38) ""u-""áti d6-ráqð6t š5šátla gàn6x.} ‘You should dance and shake yourself.’
       (A27:11)It may be used in deontic questions such as (39), in which the speaker
addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation or give per-
mission:  (39) de-maxêxle?} ‘Should we beat him?’ (A14:8)It is placed before the negative particle la in negated deontic expressions,
e.g.  (40) ""áti d6-la-dàmxeti!} ‘Do not sleep!’ (A29:19)
  (41) ""ám6r ham-ma-yxàl6f,} 'Abda-Ra˙màn d6-la-""àr6q.} ‘He said “That’s all
       right, (only) don’t let 'Abda-Ra˙màn get away.” ’ (A23:30)
  (42) ""álaha d6-là-""aw6ð!} ‘God forfend!’ (A27:37)The particle may be combined with xoš, e.g.  (43) d6-xoš-gàwra.} ‘Let her marry.’ (A26:79)(iii) šut
As with the other particles, this occurs in both positive and negative
deontic expressions, e.g.  (44) ""6n-maßya šut-""oðala. ‘If she can, let her do it.’ (C1:11)
  (45) šút la-""à°e!} ‘Let him not come!’15.1.1.6. Predictive Future (Irrealis)
The qa†6l is used to predict a future event. In class A verbs that are not
negated this is restricted to predictions that the speaker is not completely
certain about and that he is not guaranteeing will be fulfilled. This can
be designated as a modal future, e.g.  (1)   bálki ""à°ya.} ‘Perhaps she will come.’ (A8:49)
  (2)   bálki ""á°e xa-yóma ""5-bráta kˆrba mènni.} ‘Perhaps a day will come
        when that girl will be angry with me.’ (A14:98)
578                           chapter fifteen  (3)   ""àp-t6mm6l ""áxl6x mènna.} ‘We may (perhaps) eat them also tomorrow.’
        (A2:2)
  (4)   qa-mò ""óð6t ""atxa-šùla?} ‘Why would you do this thing?’ (A8:17)The form is perfective, since it presents actions delimited with a start
and end point or at least with a start point. The form may also express
iterative aspect. In this context the form can still be interpreted as perfec-
tive, in that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each
individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation, e.g.  (5)   bálki ""á°e kùt-yum} ‘Perhaps he will come everyday.’Non-modal future verbs, by which the speaker asserts that something will
take place and is committed to the truth of this assertion, are expressed
by the b6d-qa†6l form with the prefixed future particle (cf. §15.1.5.). When
negated, however, the qa†6l form in group A verbs is used to express both
the modal predictive future, where the action is uncertain (6–7), and also
the non-modal future, which predict events that the speaker is certain will
take place (8–10), e.g.  (6)  bálki lá-""awð6n xàbrux.} ‘Perhaps I shall not do as you say.’ (A21:43)
  (7)  dàx la-y>ðènne?} ‘How could I not know?’ (A14:90)
  (8)  ""áti xúwwe là ""axèll6x.} ‘The snake will not eat you.’ (A24:39)
  (9)  málla t-axèlla ""aw-lá-""ax6l ‘ú-mdi sab-rùt5la.} ‘The mullah will eat it
       and he will eat nothing because it is Friday.’ (A2:4)
  (10) qázi t-awèdla †làlux,} lá-""aw6dla †làli.} ‘The judge will make a decision
       in your favour, he will not make it in my favour.’ (A6:8)In class B verbs the qa†6l form is used to express the modal and non-modal
future in both positive and negated clauses, e.g.  (11) qa†lênnux.} ‘I shall kill you.’ (A15:4)
  (12) ""àna ma°yánne.} ‘I shall bring her back.’ (A27:30)
  (13) bálki qàrm6n.} ‘Perhaps I shall win.’ (A1:4)
  (14) brát6t màlka} pál†a l-gàre.} ‘The daughter of the king will come out
       onto the roof.’ (A27:11)
  (15) ""aw-máy6° ""u-""ùpra páy6š bíyi.} ‘He will die and his land will remain
       for me.’ (A26:25)
  (16) ""o-Mar-Mùše} x5làn5le,} maxèl5xu.} ‘Saint Muše is strong. He will strike
       you.’ (B18:7)
                               the syntax of verbs                                   579When expressing the future, the qa†6l form may have its deictic centre in
the past, as is the case with (17) where it occurs in the context of a past
narrative:  (17) hád6x m-bar-t-gwìrra,} ""aláha q6m-yawèlla xa-bròna.} ""ìma?} ""7-šet6t mˆ°i.}
       ""7-šet6t m7°i q6m-yawèlla xa-bróna zòra.} ‘So, after they married, God
       gave them a son. When? The year they would die. The year they
       would die, He gave them a small son.’ (A4:57)15.1.1.7. Conditional Constructions (Irrealis)
The qa†6l form is used in the protasis of conditional sentences referring
to present or future time, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-""ána ""amrènnux módile xèzya málka b-xêlme,} ""ánna ""álpa dáwe p>lêtla,}
        pálga †làli} pálga †làlux?} ‘If I tell you what the king saw in his dream,
        will you divide those thousand gold pieces, half for me and half
        for you?’ (A1:6)
  (2)   bas-""èn ""á°ya xá-baxta nabláli qa-kut-t-b9ya,} y6n-qa-xóna dìya,} ""ána bt-
        azàna.} ‘But, if a woman comes to take me to anyone she wants,
        or to her brother, I shall go.’ (A8:78)
  (3)   ""6n-lá-""oð6t b-xábr6t ""alàha,} b-talqèti.} ‘If you do not do the word of
        God, you will be obliterated.’ (A8:97)
  (4)   ""6n-lá-""az6n mšàyð6n.} ‘If I do not go, he will go mad.’ (A4:27)The qa†6l form occurs in the apodosis when there is a degree of uncertainty
concerning the occurrence of the situation. This is attested in contexts
where two possible alternative situations are referred to, e.g.  (5)   ""6n-íle mì°a,} g8r6g mˆ°6n.} ""u-""6n-""à°e} ""á°y6n mênne.} ‘If he is dead, I
        must die. If he comes back, I shall come back with him.’ (A8:61)
  (6)   ""6n-""óð6t xàbri,} ""òð6t.} ""6n-lá ""òð6t,} kli°à-llux-ila.} ‘If you do as I say, you
        will do so (so be it). If you do not do so, it is up to you.’ (A8:44)15.1.1.8. Irrealis Complement Clauses
The qa†6l form occurs in subordinate clauses that are complements of
various verbs and expressions when the action of the verb in the subor-
dinate clause is as yet unrealized. It is used after verbs expressing desire
and permission (e.g. by ‘to want’, šwq, qbl ‘to permit’), and also in comple-
ments of various other verbs and predications where the action is as yet
unrealized relative to the main clause. The qa†6l form in the subordinate
580                            chapter fifteenclause expresses perfective aspect, in that it presents the action as an event
with start and endpoint or at least one that is delimited by a start point
future to the present moment. It may also be used to denote an iterative
activity. In this function it is still perfective, since the speaker uses the
form that is appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence
of the iterated situation.
   The verb of such subordinate clauses is sometimes introduced by the
subordinating particle D. This particle is, however, often omitted. Its omis-
sion is particularly common after the verb by ‘to want’, e.g.  (1)   ""áp-""ana b8y6n ""àz6n.} ‘I also want to go.’ (A1:5)
  (2)   b8y6n ""amrênn6x.} ‘I want to tell you.’ (A4:41)
  (3)   b8ye ""á°e xazèlux.} ‘He wants to come and see you.’ (A4:24)
  (4)   ""ána b8y6n mênn6x} ""àwwa xóni} ""oðátle xá-ga xéta m>d6‰ètle nèšma dìye.} ‘I
        want you to make my brother (alive) again and return his breath
        to him.’ (A8:80)
  (5)   b8y6x xá-m6ndi gu-t9ra qablítula.} ‘We want you to pledge her some-
        thing on the doorstep.’ (B10:36)On some occasions, the particle occurs before the verb of the comple-
ment clause, e.g.  (6)   b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
  (7)   b8y6n ""álaha t-yawèlli mèndi zàwda.} ‘I want God to give me something
        more.’ (A3:1)Examples with other verbs:  (8)  ""áp-xa la-qábl6t t-áw6r gu-bˆ°a.} ‘You should not allow anybody to
       come into the house.’ (A23:25)
  (9) d6-šúql6n dàmx6x.} ‘Allow us to us sleep.’ (A15:8)
  (10) ""u-hálle ßàle,} šám6† qðále dìye.} ‘Let him go down (the mountain) and
       break his neck.’ (A15:13)
  (11) l7le ßbára t-áw6r xà.} ‘Nobody dares enter.’ (A32:32)
  (12) ""o-t-l7le plíxa là sáp6r t-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has not worked should not
       expect to eat.’ (A21:15)The negative particle la is sometimes used in clauses that are the comple-
ment of the verb zd"" ‘to fear’, reflecting a negative deontic dimension to
the situation, e.g.

       over the bridge, fearing greatly that I would fall into the sea
       (= wishing that I would not fall).’ (A11:7)The qa†6l form occurs in complements of expressions of obligation con-
sisting of the impersonal forms g>r6g, laz6m, b>ye (‘it is necessary’), the
former of these being the most common one. The complement clause is
not introduced by the particle D, e.g.  (14) g8r6g ""àmr6x.} ‘We must say.’ (A4:38)
  (15) g8r6g ""à°6t.} ‘You must come.’ (A7:9)
  (16) g8r6g ""ázi b6°-be-xêtna.} ‘They must go to the house of the groom.’
       (B5:36)
  (17) g8r6g rába ""áxl6t xàm.} ‘You have to be very careful.’ (B5:105)
  (18) bèl-šèdla l-šêdla} g8r6g mátteti xa-xamšá ""aqlà°a.} ‘Between the saplings
       you must leave about five steps.’ (B5:103)
  (19) láz6m ""axlênne.} ‘I must eat him.’ (A47:5)
  (20) hadíya b8ye mpal†êtle.} ‘Now you must take him out.’ (A26:77)The negative particle is placed before the verb in the complement clause,
e.g.  (21) g8r6g là-""amr6t hátxa.} ‘You must not say that.’ (A18:10)The qa†6l form occurs in complements of the verb mßy ‘to be able’ and
also of various other expressions denoting possibility (or lack of it). The
particle D is used in these constructions, though not consistently, e.g.  (22) máß6x t-àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B4:3)
  (23) máß6x ""àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B15:16)
  (24) máßi m†àli gáwa.} ‘They can play in it.’ (B11:30)
  (25) har-là-mß6n t-amrènnux.} ‘I just cannot tell you.’ (A11:2)
  (26) ""áp-xa l7le mßáya ""5-š8r6† t-awêdla.} ‘Nobody can fulfil the condition.’
       (A25:70)
  (27) ""ána bi-zóda m-hód6x là-maß6n ""oðènnux} ‘ù m6ndí.} ‘I cannot do anything
       more for you than that.’ (A8:44)

582                             chapter fifteen15.1.1.9. Irrealis Clauses Introduced by Prepositions
The qa†6l form is sometimes used in a clause introduced by the preposi-
tional phrases qam ‘before’, ha-t, hal ""5-g6t, ta ‘until’ or t-la ‘without’, which
refer to an event that has not yet taken place from the perspective of the
verb in the main clause, e.g.  (1) qam-t-à°i} mpál6†le m6n-hàbsa.} ‘Before they return, release him from
      prison.’ (A26:72)
  (2) qám t-qáre ""ax-dìga,} šáql6t m6n-d-ó ""ixàla.} ‘Before it calls out like a cock,

      (A50:15)15.1.1.10. Purpose Clauses (Irrealis)
The qa†6l form is used in clauses expressing purpose. These clauses are
sometimes introduced simply by the particle D. In many cases, however,
this is combined with the particles qa or ta, e.g.  (1) ""ána paqðênn5xu} t-azítu b-""úrxa ma†ítu ""êlla.} ‘I shall instruct you so that
      you go on the road and reach her.’ (A8:27)

       up early to work for myself, so that I can eat?’ (A21:19)Occasionally the D particle is elided before the initial consonant of class
B verbs, e.g.  (11) b>yánna bìya} b-sùsa} b-ráš6n diyéy kùlla,} ta-ßály6n ma°yànne.} ‘I want
       them all with their horse and rations, in order for me to go down
       to bring him back.’ (A25:75)
  (12) táxt5la mútte hàtxa} ta-ßáli tàma.} ‘They have put a board like this in
       order to go down there.’ (A22:10)15.1.1.11. After Particle of Imminent Future ga-
The element ga-, most likely in origin the noun gaya ‘time, instance’, takes
a verb in the qa†6l form introduced by the subordinator D as its comple-
ment to express the imminent future (‘is about to . . .’), e.g.  (1)   ga-t-à°6n.} ‘I am about to come.’The subordinator D is often elided before consonants:  (2)   ga-t-pàrq6n} ~ ga-pàrq6n.} ‘I am about to finish.’
  (3)   ga-t-mà†6x} ~ ga-mà†6x.} ‘We are about to arrive.’The construction is attested in the text corpus in (4):  (4)   ""è°y5la ""àrye.} ""ê°ye,} ""ê°ye,} š-l7wa mè†ye ""6lle-dìye,} há há ga-má†ya t-axlàle,}
        dèry6lla bòóe.} dèry6lla bòóe,} qíme tre-xùre.} ‘The lions came. They came,
584                              chapter fifteen      but they had not yet reached him. “Hah, hah” she is about to eat
      him. So, he cast the seeds. When he cast the seeds, two willow trees
      grew up.’ (A18:26)15.1.1.12. Generic Relative Clauses
The qa†6l form is used in a relative clause that has a non-specific anteced-
ent rather than one referring to a specific referent, e.g.  (1) ""alpá-dáwe b6d-yáw6l †la-kút ""amèrre mòdile xèlme.} ‘I shall give a thousand
      gold pieces to whomsoever tells me what my dream is.’ (A1:12)
  (2) kút ""ás6q qamáya xazéla ""5-dalí°a brì°6ll-ani} parêmla.} ‘The first one who
      goes up and sees the vine growing on those (trees) cuts it down.’

  (3) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ""ayya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
      she goes to and enters, the other has to follow after her.’ (B12:2)
  (4) ""an-t-óði koðênta,} t-awéle tùna.} ‘Those who keep (literally: do) mules
      have hay.’ (B5:108)15.1.1.13. In Subordinate Clauses with Past Time Reference
On numerous occasions, the qa†6l form is used in subordinate clauses in
the contexts described above also when the main clause contains a past
form verb. Such qa†6l forms have past time reference, with their deictic
centre in the tense of the main clause, e.g.  (1) ""u-b>yéwa palè†-u plì†le.} ‘He wanted to come out and he did come
      out.’ (A22:45)
  (2) ßêly5le} ta-t-""áz6l ""ùrxa.} ‘He went down to set off on the road.’
      (A15:5)
  (3) ""u-t8ra óím6lle ta-t-lá-""aw6r ""áp-xa náša gàwa.} ‘They closed the door so
      that nobody would go into it.’ (A23:24)
  (4) qímt5la šqílt5la xa-bròna} ""u-nobàlt6lle} ta-t-axlàle.} ‘She got up and
      took a son (of hers) and took him in order for her to eat him.’
      (A19:3)
  (5) ""u-síqle ta-t-áx6l mêndi.} ‘He went up to eat something.’ (A21:8)
  (6) ""áy wela-""á-bráta xar7°6t m†úmra gu-Dùre,} qam-maqimìl6n.} ‘That was the
      last girl to be buried in Dure before they evacuated us.’ (B1:12)
  (7) ""u-zílela ha-t-ázi má†i l-""á°‰6t . . . d-áw . . . báb6 d-a-bràta.} ‘They travelled
      until they reached the land of the girl’s father.’ (A29:36)

The qa†6lwa form, with the past verbal affix -wa, always has past time
reference. It has both realis and irrealis functions.","[613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624]"
"15.4.1.4. Movement of the Enclitic Copula
As remarked, positive assertive resultative constructions can have the
enclitic or the deictic copula. If special prominence is given to a particu-
lar constituent of the clause, however, only the enclitic copula is used. In
such circumstances this is moved from the participle and attached to the
prominent constituent in question. In most cases the constituent that is
given prominence in this way is placed before the participle, whatever its
grammatical function in the clause, and so the movement of the enclitic
is leftwards. In some constructions in narrative the enclitic moves right-
wards and is attached to a constituent that occurs after the participle in
the clause.",[716]
"15.4.1.4.2. Rightward Movement of the Enclitic
The default position for the nuclear stress of an intonation group is on
the last item in the group. When the nuclear stress occurs in this position,
therefore, it does not necessarily express ‘narrow focus’ on this one item
but frequently expresses a ‘broad focus’ which includes the whole predicate
of the clause.9 The copula element may be shifted rightwards onto this
word with nuclear stress at the end of the intonation group. This is done,
however, only when the nuclear stress is expressing broad focus. The pur-
pose of the construction, therefore, is not to express narrow information
focus on the word, with the remainder of the clause presupposed. Rather,
the clitic gives the item in question an enhanced prominence within the
broad focus of the predicate, due to its importance or unexpectedness. In
example (1) a group of men are transformed into sheep, which is presented
as a surprising and pivotal development by the placement of the copula
on the nouns at the end of the intonation groups. In (2) the rightward
shift of the copula highlights the royal clothes, by which the king’s son
identifies himself, and this is an important turning point in the narrative.",[728]
"14.3.2. The Function of the Demonstrative Pronouns
When examining the function of the demonstrative pronouns a distinc-
tion should be made between their use to refer to visible objects in the
extra-linguistic speech situation and their use to refer to referents within
                             the syntax of nominals                                  469the discourse. As indicated in §7.4., when used to refer to extra-linguistic
objects the pronoun system can be said to be ‘hearer orientated’, in that the
deictic centre for all pronouns is the hearer. It consists of three series:     ‘speaker deixis’       ""áwwa k°áwa ‘this book (near me)’
     ‘far deixis’           "">wáha k°áwa ‘that book (remote from me and
                            you)
     ‘default’              ""o-k°awa ‘that book (with you)’The far deixis form may be intensified by replacing the /a/ with /a""/ in
the stressed syllable: "">wá""ha k°áwa ‘that book (very remote from me and
you).
  Examples from the text corpus:  (1) qu-šqúlla ""áyya skìnta.} ‘Get up and take this knife.’ (A15:8)
  (2) yába là dámx6x gu-d-áwwa qáßra.} dámx6x l-w9d6r.} ‘Let’s not sleep in
      this palace. Let’s sleep outside.’ (A12:11)
  (3) y-ásq6x m7°6x míya m6n-d->wàha †úra.} ‘We shall go up and fetch water
      from that mountain over there.’ (A39:9)
  (4) réšux mattánne gu-d-yàha káwe} t-íla pyàša.} ‘I shall put your head in
      that opening over there that remains.’ (A25:62)
  (5) mère kˆle b7°a díya?} ""aw-xášu xa-badêkk5le.} mêra "">wá""ha qáßra t-it-xzày6lle.}
      ‘He said “Where is her house?” He thought it was a hut. They said
      “That villa that you can see over there.” ’ (A40:11)
  (6) mè†y5le xa-káwt6t ""êrwe,} ""íbe tre-†¬á°a ""álpa rēš-""êrwe.} q6m-qaréla ""an-šavàne}
      mère d-ˆnila ""an-""èrwe?} ‘He came to a flock of sheep, in which there
      were two or three thousand head of sheep. He called the shepherds
      and said “Whose are those sheep (which are in your keeping)?”’
      (A32:14)
  (7) šqíl6lla qamáye ðá-kista dàwe.} mère ""áy †làl6x} . . . mjun6gníla hàtxa.} . . . mère
      . . . ""íman t-à°y6t,} ða-kista-xéta max-d-áy yawênn6x.} ‘He first took out a
      purse of gold pieces. He said “This is for you” . . . She shook them
      like this . . . He said . . . “When you come back, I’ll give you another
      purse like that one (you are holding).”’ (A4:15–16)
  (8) kúlla ""an-waríð6x q>†ênna.} ‘I shall cut all those roots of yours.’
      (A25:64)
  (9) ""ay-mòdila?} ‘What is that (by you)?’ (A21:8)The structually least complex form, which is designated here as ‘default’,
is used when the item is with the hearer in the deictic centre. Since it is in
470                          chapter fourteenthe deictic centre, it does not have a deictic function, i.e. it does not point
the attention of the hearer to a specific point in the surrounding environ-
ment. Rather it simply indicates that the item in question is identifiable
somewhere in the accessible situation of the hearer. It would be, in fact,
more accurate to translate it simply by the English definite article, which,
likewise, is non-ostensive. The ‘speaker deixis’ and ‘far deixis’ forms, on
the other hand, have ostensive force and point the attention of the hearer
to a specific point in the environment.
   Several NENA dialects have only two series of demonstratives. These
consist of a speaker deixis form and a default form. e.g. J. Arbel:      Speaker deixis         Default
      ""iyya                  ""oThe speaker deixis form form always points to a specific point close to
the speaker. The default form may be used in a deictic or non-deictic
sense. When used in a deictic sense, it expresses ‘far deixis’, pointing to
an item that is remote from the speaker and hearer. When used in its
non-deictic sense, it does not point the hearer’s attention to any specific
point but simply indicates that the referent is identifiable somewhere in
the environment (cf. Khan 1999: 208–219). It has this non-deictic sense
when it refers to an item that is with the hearer. This two pronoun system
consisting of a speaker deixis and default form is more archaic than the
three pronoun system that is found in C. Barwar and numerous other
NENA dialects. The three pronoun system developed by creating a new
form to take over from the default form to express far deixis. As a result,
the original default form now only has a non-deictic sense.
    When used to refer to items within the discourse rather than to items
in the extra-linguistic situation, demonstrative pronouns generally have
an anaphoric function, i.e. they form a referential link with some item
elsewhere, usually earlier, in the discourse. Of the three series of pronouns,
it is the default (""o-k°awa) and speaker deixis (""awwa k°awa) forms that are
most frequently used with this anaphoric function. The default form, as
is the case when used to refer to extra-linguistic items, does not point to
any specific place in the discourse, but simply indicates that the referent
of the item is accessible somewhere in the discourse environment, typically
in the discourse history. The nearest functional equivalent in English is
the definite article, which is often the most natural translation. It is used

explicitly mentioned in the preceding discourse, e.g.

  (15) ""aw-mtunéle ""aw-xèlma qa-d-ó Xáno Lapzèrin.} ‘He told the dream to

explicitly mentioned earlier but is accessible from the preceding discourse
by virtue of its typical association with some element in the content of
this discourse (associative anaphora). Such uses of the demonstrative can
normally only be translated by the English definite article, e.g.  (16) ""ína m-bá°6r maqðàli} ""aw-qê†ma} šaqlìtule} mxamìtule.} ‘After she burns

anaphoric function, viz. when the nominal has been explicitly mentioned
in the previous discourse (21–24), with previously mentioned proper
names (25), or when the referent of the nominal is accessible by associa-
tive anaphora (26):  (21) ""í°wa xa-màlka.} ""áwwa málka xzéle xa-xêlma.} ‘There was a

       istered by a caretaker) (A22:42)Since the referents in the examples cited above are all internal to the
discourse, the speaker does not use the speaker deixis demonstratives to
point to an item that is physically close to him. Rather they express a
virtual or psychological closeness to the speaker, the purpose of which is
often to give prominence to the referent in the staging and perspective
with which it is presented. The default demonstrative, on the other hand,
                          the syntax of nominals                            473is neutral with regard to perspective and personal engagement. The choice
of the perspective with which the speaker wishes to present the referent
in a particular point in the discourse is a subjective one. Speaker deixis
demonstratives are often used to give prominence to the referents that play
a prominent role in the text, as is the case in examples (21)–(26).
   In a similar way, anaphoric reference is expressed by independent
demonstrative pronouns, with the speaker in most cases chosing either the
default demonstrative or the speaker deixis form according to the perspec-
tive with which he wishes to present the referent. Default independent pro-
nouns indicate that the referent is identifiable somewhere in the discourse
and are unspecified as to perspective or speaker engagement, e.g.  (27) ""aw- 6¬yále tópe díye spày.} ‘He loaded his gun well.’ (A31:7)
  (28) ""ay-°éla dmíxla gu-""ót6x dìya.} ‘She came back and went to sleep in

  (29) xár°a ""áni mè†yela tàma} l-márz6t yàma.} ‘Then they arrived there, by
       the shore of the sea.’ (A14:37)Speaker deixis independent pronouns are used to give prominence to a
referent in close perspective. They are often used to refer to protagonists
in a narrative and other textually prominent referents, e.g.  (30) ""áwwa plí†5le gu-ða-dúnye xèta,} š6mša milànta,} ""8ra milànta.} ‘He opened
       it and he came out into another world, with a blue sun and a blue
       land.’ (A14:26)
  (31) ""áyya rìqt5la} ßlì°5la} hàw6rila!} ‘She ran and went down (crying)
       “Beware!”’ (A24:42)
  (32) ""ánna pìðela mènne díye,} ""ap-šlàma l7la dèry6lle.} ‘They passed by him,
       but did not even greet him.’ (A15:13)There may be a shift in the type of demonstrative that is used to refer to
one particular referent in different sections of the discourse, which reflects
changes in perspective. This is illustrated in (33), an extract from a narrative
that involves two protagonists, the Leli°a monster and the daughter-in-law
of the family. The narrative begins with the arrival of the Leli°a. In this
section she is the most salient and most active character and is presented
with close perspective by the speaker deixis demonstrative ""ayya [1]. In the
course of the narrative, however, the daughter-in-law becomes the most
salient character, who has the most control over the flow of events. This
is reflected by the use of the speaker deixis pronouns ""ayya [2] and [4],
474                           chapter fourteenwhereas Leli°a is referred to by default demonstratives, viz. ""ay [3] and
[5], and the attributive demonstrative in ""5-Leli°a.  (33) hadìya} ""í°wa xa-Lelí°a °í°a m6n-ô?l.} °éla ßlèla} l-""árx6t be-Xàmmo.}

       came from ôāl. She came down to the water-mill of the family
       of Xammo. A man had a water-mill and his name was Xammo.
       He had a daughter-in-law. He had sons. She (Leli°a) came down
       and greeted them. . . . What did she (the daughter-in-law) do on
       her return? She closed the door and in the middle of the house
       she made a fire. . . . The Leli°a came. She was all (made of) fat,
       fat, oil. . . . She (the daughter-in-law) was constantly taking the iron
       bars and putting them into her, until she killed her. She killed her,
       and she (Leli°a) remained there.’ (A19:1–6)A further example is the extract in (34), in which the protagonist Xano
is referred to by a speaker deixis demonstrative [2] and subsequently by
a default demonstrative [3]. This can be correlated with a difference in
discourse prominence. The section beginning with the speaker deixis
demonstrative [2] is a foregrounded section that advances the narrative.
The following section with the default form [3] supplies elaborative back-
ground information, which recapitulates an earlier, previously mentioned
event. It is worth noting that the clause with the default pronoun [1],
which refers to the king, also conveys repetitive background material,
since it comes immediately after a speech of the king in which he reports
his dream:  (34) ""aw-[1]mtunéle ""aw-xèlma qa-d-ó Xáno Lapzèrin.} ""áwwa [2] mère
       b-àlaha} har-xá-m6ndi ""ì° b-áyya dúk°a t-íle wìra.} ""áw [3] xzèle ""o-dídwa

       He (Xano) said (to himself ) ‘By God, there must be something
       in this place where it entered’. He (Xano) had seen where the fly
       had entered.’ (A11:9)
                           the syntax of nominals                             475Similarly in (35) the speaker deixis demonstrative [1] is in a clauses
that initiates a section describing a foreground event. The default dexis
demonstrative [2], which refers to the same character, can be interpreted
as elaborative information, which supplements the previously described
event rather than advancing the narrative:  (35) ""áwwa [1] b-l7le qìm5le.} gáw‰a díya mqulèbz6lle dèry6lle gawàya.} ""áw
       [2] píša b-áy-gota xèt5le.} ‘He got up in the night. He rolled over her
       husband and put him in the middle. He came to be on the other
       side.’ (A30:53)In constructions expressing a contrastive opposition between two items, the
two different demonstratives are used to separate distinctly the two items,
since they present them with different virtual spatial locations in the stag-
ing of the situation. In (37) and (38) the demonstratives express associative
anaphora. The ‘boys’ in (37) are typically associated with a school and the
table and its sides in (38) are associated with the act of sitting:  (36) ""5-dán6 t-ìla ‰íše,} kút-xa gu-šwí°6t gàne,} ""áyya gu-qáßr6t bába dìya,} ""áw
       gu-‘ádre dìye} ‘When they woke up, each in their own bed, she in
       the palace of her father and he in his tent . . .’ (A4:5)
  (37) bróna díya gu-m6drása kút-yum y-awéwa mxáya l-aw-yàla,} šqála ‘ánta
       d-àwwa,} šrà†a m6ndiyáne.} ‘Her son everyday in school would beat
       one child, take the bag of another, tear things.’ (A14:5)
  (38) holá-""6°ye tìwe,} báxta tíwta l-àyya-got6t m¶s,} ""u-gáw‰a tíwa l-ày-gota.}
       ‘They came and sat down, the wife sitting on this side of the table
       and the husband sitting on the other side.’ (A4:57)The virtual spatial separation is sometimes enhanced by using spatial
adverbs, e.g.  (39) díw6n t-xále díye hóla dwìqta.} ""áyya díw6n làxx5la} ""aw-gàrele.} ‘The
       meeting room of his uncle is full. The meeting room is here and
       that is its roof.’ (A23:14)The speaker deixis demonstratives are sometimes used primarily to express
close emotional engagement with the referent with an evaluative sense,
which may be negative or positive. This is the case in (40)–(42), which
are extracts from direct speech. This speech is uttered by the speakers to
476                         chapter fourteenthemselves in the absence of the referent of the nominal. The demonstra-
tives, therefore, are not anaphoric nor are they used to point the attention
of a hearer to an item in the extra-linguistic situation:  (40) ""áyya xmàrta!} ‘That she-ass!’ (A10:10)
  (41) mo-‘ára t-óð6x †la-d-áyya qá†u t-la ""axlàl5ni?} ‘What solution can we
       find for this cat so that it does not eat us?’ (A44:1)
  (42) b-álaha hóle híw6lle rèsqa d-áwwa gáw‰a ‘By God, he has provided the
       sustenance of this husband (of mine).’ (A10:7)Speaker deixis demonstratives are occasionally used with a nominal that
introduces a new referent into the discourse, when the speaker has a
particular personal interest in the referent. In (43), for example, a speaker
deixis demonstrative is used with the word ‘bridge’, which does not yet
exist in the extra-linguistic situation, nor has it been mentioned in the
preceding discourse. The speaker, however, proposes building such a
bridge. In (44) the speaker has a strong personal interest in the pot of
gold, which she introduces here for the first time in her speech to her
neighbour, although the object itself is not visible in the speech situation.
In English such demonstratives are most naturally translated by the indefi-
nite article, though in some contexts a translation with a demonstrative
is also possible:  (43) xàli} lá ""awðèxle ""áwwa gêšra} šáwr6x réša réša d-ánna mìya?} ‘Uncle,
       should we not make a bridge for it so that we can cross over this
       water?’ (A17:3)
  (44) xá-duk°a hon-xzí°a hátxa dàwe,} ""áyya qadált6 dàwe.} ‘In a certain
       place I have found gold coins like this, a/this pot of gold coins.’
       (A10:9)A demonstrative may have an anaphoric function when the referent in
question is visible in the speech situation. In (45), for example, the func-
tion of the default demonstrative ""an- is to indicate that the arrows which
the speaker shows to the hearer are those that have been mentioned
previously in the discourse history. It does not point the hearer’s attention
to the referent. This is done by the presentative particle ho. In (46) the
speaker deixis subject pronoun ""anna points to the ring and scarf in the
speech situation, but the default demonstrative ""ani in the predicate has an
anaphoric function binding the reference to the preceding discourse:
                            the syntax of nominals                               477  (45) °éli hó ""an-†¬á ger6-qêšta.} ‘I’ve come back and here are the three arrows
       of a bow (to which reference was made earlier).’ (A12:46)
  (46) ""ína ""áyya ""isèq°a ""u-yalèxta d-ˆnila?} hóla ""isêq°a,} hóla yalêxta.} má†o mda-
       glènna gàni} t-ámr6n ""ánna l7la ""àni.} ‘But whose is this ring and scarf ?
       Here is a ring and here is a scarf. How can I make myself lie and
       say that these are not those (belonging to the girl I mentioned)?’
       (A26:12)The far deixis demonstrative is occasionally used to refer to items that
are internal to the discourse. The usual context for this is where two or
more members of a set are presented in a contrastive opposition. One
member is typically presented with either a speaker deixis or default
deixis demonstrative and the other and any further members are given
a far deixis demonstrative. The function of the far deixis demonstrative
is to separate the members of the set clearly in the virtual space of the
discourse, e.g.  (47) mattíwala gu-d-7 m6ššára xá, tré, †¬à°a.} man7wa hal-""êßra.} ""èßra gu-d-àyya,}
       ""èßra gu-d-yàha,} ""èßra gu-d-yáha xèta,} hàtxa.} ‘They would plant
       them in the paddy field, one, two, three and count up to ten. Ten
       in this (row), ten in that one, ten in that other one, and so forth.’

       ‘Every day in the neighbourhood he would steal the chicken of

       ‘They went and kept a guard in that far corner, and one in that
       other corner.’ (A18:3)Sometimes only one member of the set is explicitly mentioned, the other(s)
being implied, e.g.  (51) kút-xa †la-gáne šuréle dwàqa.} ßúdr6t S6ttìye} ""áwwa xálqa n‘ìlle,} Fárxo
       q6m-xazéle ßàdra. Čixàlo,} m-ya-góta xèta,} q6m-xazéla ""ína xzéle ßádra

       of the blouse of S6ttiye was torn off and Farxo saw her breast.
478                           chapter fourteen        Čixalo, on the other side, saw them and noticed that he saw her
        breast, and became angry.’ (A25:29–30)In (52) the narrator uses a far deixis demonstrative to express the physical
distance of one referent from another:  (52) mèra Fárxo tu-tâmà""ha.} Fárxo tíw5le r6š-d-wá""ha kèpa.} ‘She (Naze) said
       “Farxo sit far over there.” Farxo sat on that far stone (i.e. far from
       Naze).’ (A25:17)In (53) the far deixis independent demonstrative is used contrastively to
make it clear that the reference is to somebody other than the person
mentioned in the previous clause:  (53) S6ttìye} šmìla} bába díya hóle mùtta} jallàde,} b-jáldi réš6t Fàrxo.} s9bab}
       "">wáha škèle,} mère lì°ba fáyda.} ‘S6ttiye heard that her father had
       appointed executioners, who would cut off the head of Farxo.
       This was because he (i.e. Čixalo not Farxo) had complained. He
       (the king) said “It is no use” (he should be executed).’ (A25:32)In principle a noun that has an attributive demonstrative is definite in
status, i.e. the speaker assumes that the hearer is able to identify the ref-
erent. The only exception is where the speaker uses the speaker deixis
form to introduce into the discourse a new referent in which he has a
particular interest (43–44). We have seen that anaphoric reference is
generally expressed either by the default or speaker deixis demonstratives,
the use of the far deixis being marginal. A noun that is definite in status,
however, is not obligatorily combined with an anaphoric demonstrative. It
can also be left without any demonstrative. We have discussed above the
circumstances that motivate the speaker to use different demonstratives for
anaphoric reference in discourse. Here we shall examine the motivation
to omit a demonstrative on a definite noun that has an anaphoric con-
nection with the preceding discourse. In general the heavier morphology
with the explicit anaphoric demonstrative (""o-k°awa) is a more powerful
anaphoric device that is used when the noun is disjoined to a greater
extent from its anaphor. This disjunction is not brought about only by
                               the syntax of nominals                                    479textual distance but also by boundaries in the discourse structure. Indeed,
the heavy morphology can be used as a device to mark boundaries.1 This
is illustrated in the passage (54) below, which describes the preparation
of yoghurt butter know as óita. The passage can be divided into four sec-
tion according to its content. The noun masta ‘yoghurt’ is introduced in
section (ii). At the onset of section (iii) the second mention of the noun
is marked by a demonstrative. The third mention of the noun, however,
has no demonstrative, since it occurs in a clause that is closely connected
with what precedes and is not separated from the previous mention by
a discourse boundary. The fourth mention of the noun at the onset of
section (iv), however, has a demonstrative again, since it is separated from
the previous mention by a discourse boundary. The same applies to the
noun m6šxa ‘butter’. The second mention has no demonstrative, since it is
not separated from the first mention by a discourse boundary. The third
mention, however, at the onset of the section (v) has a demonstrative.   (54) (i) xèlya t-heywàne} t-""èrwe ""6n-tawrà°a,} xèlya mar6x°ìle} ""u-šoqíle p7ša d8raj

        quarter of an hour, ten minutes, half an hour, they shake it and
        shake it until the yoghurt (3) becomes like water. (iv) They
        gather together the butter (1) of the yoghurt (4). They gather
        it together and take it out. The butter (2) becomes separated.
        They put the dawwe (yoghurt water) in a large pot. (v) We call this
        butter (3) óita.’ (B6:37–40)

     The cross-linguistic evidence for fuller coding being used at the boundaries of discourse
units is examined by Huang (2000: 309ff.).
480                           chapter fourteen   In certain constructions a demonstrative pronoun is regularly used.
The use of the default demonstrative is the norm, for example, with a
noun that is the head of a restrictive relative clause. As elsewhere, this
demonstrative does not point to any particular place in the discourse but
rather indicates simply that the referent is identifiable in the accessible
context. The close syntactic dependence of the relative clause on the head
forces the search for the identity of the referent to be made in the relative
clause rather than the preceding discourse, even if the referent has been
mentioned previously, e.g.  (55) ""è°y5le ""o-yál6t b>yàwale.} ‘The young man whom she loved came.’
       (A12:42)
  (56) ""a-pálla t-wawa-r6š-qalùnka} wíðt6lla hátxa ßlì°5la.} ‘She moved the
       burning coal that was in the pipe like this and it fell.’ (A11:21)
  (57) ""ê°y5le} wíð5le ""a-dúk°a nišànqa,} ""a-dúk°a t-wéwa ""o-dídwa wíra tàma.}
       ‘He came and marked the place, the place where the fly had
       entered.’ (A11:10)In some cases the noun has not been referred to in the preceding dis-
course and the scope of the anaphora can only be internal to the nominal
phrase, e.g.  (58) hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n} har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘Until the day I
       die I shall always keep to God’s way.’ (A15:21)The head noun may have a non-specific, generic referent. In such cases the
the scope of the anaphora is generally internal to the nominal phrase and
a translation with an indefinite article is most natural in English, e.g.  (59) m6n-sab-""7-""ot6x t-là-hawe gáwa ßópa,} yá'ni p5šáwa tàlga hal-qedámta,}
       ""áp-xa le-maßéwa damèxwa gáwa dìya.} ‘Since a room that did not have
       a stove in it would become icy by the morning and nobody would
       be able to sleep in it.’ (B15:26)The demonstrative pronoun on the head noun of a restrictive relative
should still be regarded as anaphoric in function in that it relates the noun
to some other item in the discourse, viz. the description in the relative
clause. Although the default demonstrative here and elsewhere are often
most appropriately translated by the English definite article and, like the
English article, does not have ostensive force, it still differs from the English
                          the syntax of nominals                            481article in some respects. Crucially the default demonstrative always has
an anaphoric function and is not used simply as a marker of definiteness.
This is shown by the fact that, unlike the English article, it is not used with
a noun whose referent is identifiable by virtue of its descriptive content,
independently of context or dependent modifiers, when this noun has no
anaphoric connection with the preceding context, e.g. ‘the sun’:  (60) šèšma h6š-lˆla mxí°a l-†uráne.} ‘The sun has not yet struck the moun-
       tains.’ (A26:37)A relative clause that does not have a head noun must have a pronominal
head in the form of a demonstrative. Again, the demonstrative is ana-
phoric, in that it binds its referent to the content of the dependent relative
clause. The referent may be specific or, more commonly, non-specific.
When it is non-specific, it generally has no anaphoric connection with
what precedes and the scope of the anaphora is internal to the nominal
phrase, e.g.  (61) ""o-t-íle plíxa ""àw bt-áx6l.} ‘He who has worked will eat.’ (A21:15)
  (62) ""o-t-maßèwa} ""ítwale ""èrwe ràbe.} ‘Whoever had the means, had many
       sheep.’ (B10:54)
  (63) ""o-t-""ítle ""êrwe,} ""o-t-""ítle tàwre} y-áwe xzída gêlla.} ‘Somebody who has
       sheep or somebody who has cattle has harvested grass.’ (B5:108)
  (64) ""a-t-la-ßaléwa kawsa-díya ‘she whose hair did not come down (when
       combed)’ (B10:68)
  (65) ""an-t-w7wa gu-Lèvi} ‘those who were in the Levies’ (B10:52)Occasionally a default anaphoric demonstrative is used on a newly
introduced item that is described further in subsequent clauses as in (66).
In such cases the specifying clauses are not syntactically embedded in a
relative construction. The demonstrative nevertheless binds the noun to
what follows, in that it introduces the expectancy that what follows will
assist in its identification:  (66) ""u-qˆ†a,} bár t-ila-dwàqa,} qám t-mà†i} g8r6g maxètla darmàna,} qá-t
       ""an-márre la-""á°i ""èlla dìya,} mtarêmza,} yán †arpá°a díya xàrwi,} xabúšta
       xàrwa.} ‘In summer, after it bears fruit, before (the apples) become
       ripe, you must apply chemical (insecticide), so that the diseases do
       not afflict it, (whereby) it wilts or its leaves are harmed and the
       apple tree is harmed.’ (B5:106)
482                            chapter fourteenAn adjective that stands independently of a head noun is generally nomi-
nalized by taking a pronominal head. If the resultant phrase is definite,
the head is a demonstrative (see §14.7.). The default demonstrative is
generally used when the speaker wishes to express anaphora rather than
deixis, e.g.  (67) ""í°wa xa-màlka.} ""ì°wale} †¬à bnóne.} . . . ""o-gò‰a} mère . . . ‘There was a
       king. He had three sons. . . . The elder one said . . .’ (A24:4)
  (68) °éle xa-náša swarìyya,} rakáwa.} ßléle r6š-xa-""ˆna.} . . . °éle xá rakáwa xèna,}
       swarìyya.} zílle r6š-""ˆna.} . . . ""o-qamàya} ""ám6r ""òh} zúzi munšìli.} ‘A
       horseman, a rider came. He alighted at a spring. . . . Another rider
       came, a horseman. He went to the spring. . . . The first one said
       “Oh, I have forgotten my money.” ’ (A15:1–2)
  (69) fa-náše kúlla pàl†i} xa-maryóse ""o-xréna mìya.} ‘All the people go out
       and scatter water on one another.’ (B6:10)If the adjective is modified by an intensifier or by the comparative particle
biš, the demonstrative pronoun is combined with the relative particle D,
e.g.  (70) ""o-t biš-daqìqa.} ‘the one that (is) thinner’ (B10:49)The independent demonstrative head may be placed before a genitive
phrase consisting of the particle D and a dependent noun, e.g.  (71) púwuš m-7ni m6nnˆle?} ""o-t rêzza.} ‘What type of hay is it? That of
       rice.’ (B5:113)
  (72) ""ína mást6t ""èrwe rába biš-basimt7la biš-príšt5la m6n-d-a-t-tàwre.} ‘But the
       yoghurt of sheep is much better and more choice than that of
       cattle.’ (B5:173)The pronominal heads of headless relative, genitive or nominalized adjec-
tives are occasionally expressed by a speaker deixis demonstrative. This
may have either intra-linguistic reference (73) or extra-linguistic reference
(74–75):  (73) núbl6lle k6s-xá m-ánna t-óði tásm6 sàwle.} ‘He took it to one of those
       people who make shoelaces.’ (A11:12)
                             the syntax of nominals                                   483  (74) ga-béna ""ánna kúlla t-íla zála l7la mßáya b-an-""árbi bnà°a?} ‘Well, cannot
       all these people who are going (to fight) prevail against the forty
       girls?’ (A12:58)
  (75) ""áyya smóqta ""íla dêmmi} ""u-""áyya milánta ""íla ròxi,} ""u-""áyya xwárta ""íla
       nêšmi.} ‘This red one (bead) is my blood. This blue one is my spirit.
       This white one is my soul.’ (A25:35)A demonstrative is the norm after the particle har in constructions with
the sense of ‘the same’, e.g.  (76) šaqlíle-har-""o-lêxma.} ‘They take the same bread.’ (B6:49)
  (77) tèrw6°na mubrèla} hàr ""o-yóma.} ‘The two of them gave birth on the
       same day.’ (A25:4)
  (78) híw5le xábra †la-w>z‰r} har-b-ò-l5le.} ‘He gave word to the minister
       on the same night.’ (A4:34)
  (79) dìya} ""ahwalètte šuxlêpla,} l5la-""ax-qàm°a,} ""ína šèra} har-""o-šèra,} har-o-""iqàra.}
       ‘Now circumstances have changed. It is not like formerly, but the
       festival is the same festival, the same respect (is shown).’ (B5:72)In (80) and (81) the demonstrative expressing ‘the same’ is anaphorically
bound to a dependent noun in an annexation construction. The particle
har is used only in (80):  (80) ""ap-""áni har-""ó-mdi-t xabùšela.} ‘They are the same thing as apples.’
       (B5:218)
  (81) ""ap-""ána b-ay-""úrxa d-ànn6n ""è°ya.} ‘I have come on the same way as
       these people.’ (A8:58)14.3.3. Stress Position in Stress Groups
When an attributive demonstrative is combined with a noun in a single
stress group, the stress may fall on the demonstrative or on the noun
(§6.5.). The normal position of the stress is on the noun. When it is
placed on the demonstrative, it generally increases the anaphoric force
of the demonstrative. This is particularly clear when the demonstrative
takes a nuclear stress in expressions such as har-ò-yoma} ‘on that very same
day’ (B5:48). The nuclear stress is put on the demonstrative also in cases
where the previous mention of the referent occurred a long way back
in the discourse history. Example (1) comes after a lengthy section of
484                             chapter fourteendiscourse at a scene away from the spring. In this clause the reference to
the spring is reinvoked:  (1) ""u-dí‰5le ßèly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na.} ‘He went back down to that spring.’
      (A26:32)This may be contrasted with (2), which occurs earlier in the discourse
when the scene is still set at the spring and the referent of ‘the spring’ is
more accessible:  (2) ""ánna bná°e díye r6š-d-5-""ˆna-wawa.} ‘His daughters were by that spring.’
      (A26:25)In cases such as (3) and (4) the anaphoric connection is powerfully
asserted since the speaker judges that some clarification of reference is
necessary:  (3) qím5le zìl5le} mú°ya xákma gêlde,} sí‰6lla b-gàne.} wíð6lla gān-díye ""ax-dêbba,}
      ""ò-naša.} ‘He went and brought some skins and tied them on himself.
      He made himself like a bear, that man.’ (B18:5)
  (4) ""ína yóm6t ""éð6 ßlìwa} t6ltáss6r b-""êóóa} ""7-šet6t wìrra} qúrb6t tré-""alpe ""u-xamš-
      6mmà-naše} ""ítwa ˙ðìre} ""ò-yoma.} ‘On the day of the Festival of the
      Cross, the thirteenth of September last year, about two thousand
      five hundred people were present, on that day.’ (B15:93)Stress is sometimes put on the demonstrative of a noun that is modified
by a syntactically dependent relative clause, which has the effect of bind-
ing the head more closely with its modifier. This is often found when the
head noun is low in semantic content, especially ""ó-m6ndit ‘the thing that’
or temporal expressions such as ""ó-yom6t ‘the day that’, ""7-šet6t ‘the year
that’, e.g.  (5) ""ó-m6ndit ""àna xílli} ‘the thing that I ate’ (A2:8)
  (6) ""ó-yom6t xèzya dúnye ráye tèle} záwn6t lèbewa.} ‘The day he saw that it
      was raining foxes, it was the time of tricks.’ (A1:24)
  (7) ""7-šet6t mˆ°i} ‘the year they were to die’ (A4:57)Referential binding is also the purpose of the stress on the demonstrative in
constructions such as (8) and (9). These are correlative type constructions,
in which the speaker wishes to signal the tight dependency of the second
member with what precedes by means of the stressed demonstrative:
                           the syntax of nominals                             485  (8) ""7k5la †7ra díya °í°a tíwta bá°6r d-ˆ-ma°a.} ‘Where her bird had
      come—she settled behind that village (= She settled behind the
      village where her bird had come)’ (A24:30)
  (9) là-pal†6t,} hal-t-amrênnux plù†gena} ""ˆ-ga pál†6t.} ‘Do not come out, until
      when I say to you “Come out!”, at that time you should come out’
      (A14:67)14.3.4. Discourse Anaphora
An independent demonstrative pronoun may refer to the propositional
content of the surrounding discourse rather than to a referent. In such
cases of discourse anaphora the demonstrative is often a feminine speaker
deixis form, e.g.  (1) ""ap-""áyya qbilàli.} ‘I accept also this.’ (A15:17)
  (2) ""àyya} kùlla} b-lˆlela.} ‘All this is at night.’ (A25:67)Alternatively an attributive demonstrative may be combined with a noun
that refers to the propositional content of what precedes, e.g.  (3) fa-l-d-áw †ùxsa,} ""áxni ""ó-yoma y-óðexi ""áp-""axni musàrde.} ‘In this manner
      we perform (the festival of) musarde on that day.’ (B6:11)14.3.5. Combination of a Demonstrative Pronoun with the Indefinite Particle
A default attributive demonstrative may be combined with the indefinite
cardinal particle xa. The forms are as follows:     ms.                ""ó-xa ~ ""o-xáha
     fs.                ""á-ġða ~ ""a-ġðáha
     pl.                ""án-xa ~ ""an-xáhaExamples: ""ó-xa náša, ""o-xáha náša ‘the man’, ""á-ġða baxta, ""a-ġðáha báxta ‘the
woman’, ""án-xa náše, ""an-xáha náše ‘the people’.
   As can be seen, the feminine form of the cardinal numeral preserves
its original consonant (ġða < *xða < *˙ ā), whereas this is elided in other
contexts (ða). Note also that the cardinal xa is used also with plural
nouns, which is not the case in other contexts. The –aha ending in the
alternative forms presumably arose by analogy with that of the far deixis
pronouns.
486                          chapter fourteen    The usual function of this construction is to indicate that the referent
of the noun is accessible in the memory of the hearer rather than in the
current discourse history. The indefinite particle by itself indicates to the
hearer that the referent is newly introduced and not accessible. Its combi-
nation with the anaphoric demonstrative is used as a device to signal that
it is newly presented in the current discourse but nevertheless recoverable
from some discourse or experience that took place on some other occasion
in the past. It is, therefore, less easily accessible than referents that have
a connection with the preceding discourse. Examples:  (1) °éle ""o-xa-náša t-in mír6llux tèmm6l t-a°e ""êdyo?} ‘Has that man come
      who I said to you yesterday would come today?’
  (2) °éle ""o-xa-náša t-ít x6zy6lle têmm6l?} ‘Has the man whom you saw yes-
      terday come?’
  (3) txár6t ""o-xa-náša t-wéwa láxxa qam-šàb°a?} ‘Do you remember the man
      who was here a week ago?’
  (4) txár6t ""a-ġða-báxta kóre t-wáwa gu-mà°a?} ‘Do you remember the blind
      woman who was in the village?’
  (5) txár6t ""án-xa xon>wá°a kóre t-w7wa gu-mà°a?} ‘Do you remember the
      blind brothers who were in the village?’Examples from the text corpus:  (6) txár6t ""an-xa-tré t-mut6pqíwal6n b-ġðàðe?} ‘Do you remember the couple
      that we brought together?’ (A4:45)
  (7) ""ána ""o-xà qáša} t-ín ""è°ya gu- iyàre,} q6m-doqètli xošètli gu-gòma.} ‘I am
      the priest who (you remember) came to iyare, whom you seized
      and confined in the basement stable.’ (B17:15)
  (8) ""u-hád6x ""í°wa ""án-xa sobá°6t kêsl6n,} bux5rìyewa.} ‘The stoves (you
      remember) in our community were thus, they were smoke ducts.’
      (A4:60)
  (9) ""o-xá-m6ndi ""íle xêzwa ""è°y6lli} l7le xêlma.} ‘The thing (that I remember
      seeing) is a vision that came to me, it is not a dream.’ (A8:7)In (10) the referent of the noun ‘washing-board’ is, in fact, mentioned
in the immediately preceding discourse. The demonstrative + indefinite
particle construction, however, makes an anaphoric connection with an
earlier conversation in the memory of the interlocutor rather than with
the mention in the current discourse. Similarly in (11) ‘the blind wolf ’ is
mentioned in the preceding question of the woman. The demonstrative
                          the syntax of nominals                            487+ indefinite particle construction in the response of the husband, how-
ever, makes an anaphoric connection with the story about the wolf that
the woman remembers rather than with the mention of the wolf in her
current question:  (10) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle
       bíya.} ‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards
       which I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)
  (11) xá-yoma mbuqèrra mèra mòdi m-áyya qèßß6t díye ""o-déwa kòra?} mêre} ""êrw6n}
       ""o-xá-dewa kóra dmìxa gu-†úra.} kút-yum xá-""6rw6n y-arèqwa y-ás6q
       qám . . . d-o-dèwa,} ""aw y-axêlwale.} ‘One day she asked saying “What
       is this story about the blind wolf ?” He said “Our sheep—the blind
       wolf (you remember me talking about) is sleeping in the mountains.
       Every day one of our sheep would run up to that wolf and he
       would eat it.”’ (A10:5)
                    14.4. Annexation ConstructionsAs described in §10.16., when one noun is annexed to another by means
of the particle D (§4.4.), the first noun in the phrase is a head noun and
the second is a dependent modifier. The modifier noun is, in principle,
restrictive in function. Various types of semantic relationship exist between
the head and the modifier, including:  (i)   Item—possessor, e.g. ßáwl6t màlka} ‘the shoe of the king’ (A17:28),
        ""árx6t be-Xàmmo} ‘the water-mill of the family of Xammo’
        (A19:1).
  (ii) Part—whole, e.g. yomán6t yàrxa} ‘the days of the week’ (A17:15),
        kot8l6t ""êrxe} ‘the channel of the water-mill’ (A22:45).
  (iii) Vessel—contents, e.g. xa-kawáz6t mìya} ‘a pot of water’ (A21:10),
        ða-qènn6t d6bbòre} ‘a nest of hornets’ (A20:6).
  (iv) Item—affiliation, e.g. ""áġ6t ô?l ‘the lord of ôāl’ (A19:2), málk6t
        Màġr6b} ‘the king of Morocco’ (A28:37), ""ánna náš6t mà°a} ‘these
        people of the village’ (A48:2), brón6t màlka ‘the son of the king’
        (A32:21).
  (v) Item—material, e.g. xa-†ás6t dàwa} ‘a goblet of gold’ (A15:11), šíš6t
        prêzla ‘bars of iron’ (A19:4).
  (vi) Time—event, e.g. dán6t kawù°ra ‘lunch-time’ (A22:22).
  (vii) Item—attribute, e.g. xále díye t-˙aqqù°a} ‘his real uncle’ (A23:28).
488                         chapter fourteen  (viii) Item—identification, e.g. ""á°‰6t Bàrw6r ‘the land of Barwar’ (B4:1),
         má°6t ""æn-Nune ‘the village of ""“n-Nune’ (B1:9).
  (ix) Evaluation—item, e.g. qa†òle} t-muš6lmàne} ‘murderers of Muslims,
         murderous Muslims’ (B2:2)
  (x) Action—participant, e.g. qyámt6t màran} ‘the resurrection of our
         Lord’ (B5:55), xyápt6t xêtna} ‘the washing of the groom’ (B15:74).","[507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527]"
"The historical origin of the ending -o is likely to be the diminutive ending
*-ōn in the absolute state. The final *n has been elided, as is regularly the
case in absolute state endings that survive elsewhere in the dialect, e.g.
in the 3pl. present base of the verb (qa li < *qā līn) and in numerals ( 6sri
‘twenty’ < 6srīn).
    The diminutive sense of the ending is still evident in most of the nouns
listed above. Historically, however, the ending *-ōn (absolute state of *-ōnā)
is a masculine rather than a feminine form. It has apparently acquired
                                    nouns                                 349feminine gender by a semantic association between feminine gender
and diminutives, which is reflected elsewhere in the dialect (§10.5.2.3.).
It should be noted, however, that in some NENA dialects this ending is
developing into a general feminine inflection. This is the case, for example,
in C. Alqosh, where the feminine active participle regularly ends in -u
(< *ō), e.g. x5 u ‘dressmaker’ (f.), yapyu ‘baker-woman’, gaðlu ‘knitter-woman’
(Coghill 2003: §7.8.5.). These are feminine equivalents of the masculine
active participle CaCaCa but are derived historically from the participle
base *CāCC-, as is the case with nouns such as patlo, naqro, xapro etc. in
C. Barwar.
   The diminutive sense of -o may relate to novelty, as in kyalo ‘bride’, who
is a ‘new daughter-in-law’ (kal°a).
   It can also be used to express endearment rather than physical small-
ness. It is used productively in this way to create hypocoristic forms of
personal names. These are shortened forms that generally have the bisyl-
labic pattern CVCo or CVCCo. Hypocoristic names of this type are those
of both men and women (for a full list see §21.22.), e.g.(i) Men’s names
     B6nno                 < B6nyam6n
     Čăbo, Šăbo            < Xošăba

      %ššo                 < El6šwaThe kinship term tota is frequently used with the hypocoristic ending:
toto ‘granny’. Note also the form š6tro ‘beautiful woman’, a hypocoristic
form of š6tranta.
   The ending -o is also used in names given to individual domesticated
animals (for a full list see §21.23.). In this usage, however, it is restricted
to male animals, e.g.(i) Oxen
     Xămo
     Niso

       %nšăro
                       10.7. Nouns with -E InflectionThis ending is found in a number of nouns of Aramaic stock. These are
of both genders. In some cases it appears to be derived historically from
the absolute state of a noun with a final *y radical, e.g.       arxe, 6rxe f.        ‘water-mill’ (Syr. ra yā)
       ore f.               ‘manger’ (Syr. uryā)
      xuwwe m.              ‘snake’ (Syr. ewyā)
      l5le m.               ‘night’ (Syr. līlyā, pl. laylē)In other cases the historical origin is likely to be a plural form, e.g.      gare m.               ‘roof ’ (Syr. eggārā, pl. eggārē)
      kawe f.               ‘small window’ (Syr. kaw ā, pl. kawwē)The use of an original plural form to denote a singular is found elsewhere,
e.g. na°a ‘ear’ (< * eðnā°ā). The explanation may be that the referent in
question most commonly occurs as a collectivity. The roofs of houses
in the villages were generally contiguous and interconnecting. A build-
ing generally had several of the small windows in question. All of these
originally plural nouns have acquired a new plural form (garăwa°a ‘roofs’,
kăwa°a ‘windows’, na°ya°a ‘ears’).
   The final -e in the form yamne ‘right (hand/side)’ probably developed by
analogy with the Kurdish loanword čappe ‘left’. The form yamne is presum-
ably derived ultimately from a form such as *yammīnā as in Syriac. The
analogy with čappe, therefore, affected not only the inflectional ending but
also the morphological pattern.
   The final -e in stem II and stem III infinitives (mqa ole, maq ole) is derived
historically from final *-ē.
   The ending -e also occurs on numerous Kurdish loanwords that are
feminine in gender, e.g.      beriye f.         ‘milkmaid’              < Kurd. bêrî f.
      čale f.           ‘pit’                   < Kurd. çal f.
      čappe f.          ‘left (hand/side)’      < Kurd. çep f.

"15.4.1.4.1. Leftward Movement of the Enclitic
In constructions where the enclitic copula is moved leftwards it is important
to distinguish cases where the constituent that is given prominence bears
the nuclear stress and cases where the nuclear stress is placed elsewhere
in the clause. As a general rule, prominent items bearing the nuclear
stress are clausal arguments expressing some kind of information focus,
by which the speaker wishes to draw the hearer’s attention to important
new information. This may be termed ‘narrow’ focus, in that attention is
drawn to one particular argument in the clause and not to the predicate
or overall proposition as a whole. The normal default position for the
678                             chapter fifteennuclear stress is at the end of the intonation group. Since the focused item
is placed at the beginning of the clause the nuclear stress is in a marked
position. Items given prominence that do not bear the nuclear stress, on
the other hand, are generally not a focus of new information.(i) Narrow New Information Focus
One type of narrow new information focus that is expressed by the attach-
ment of the enclitic copula is contrastive focus. This is used when the
speaker wishes to correct a misunderstanding by strongly asserting that
one particular item should be selected for the role in question rather than
the one currently entertained by the hearer, e.g.","[716, 717]"

"14.1.2.1. Particle Used
There is a tendency to use the particle in the following circumstances:(i) Nominals with a topically prominent referent
In such cases the referent of a nominal with the particle acquires salience
due to its prominent topical role within the following text. This is clearly
seen by the regular use of the particle to introduce a protagonist at the
beginning of a narrative, e.g.  (7) ""í°wa xa-nàša} gu-ða-mà°a,} rába rába duglàna-wewa.} mdagèlwa m6n-
      nàše,} y-ám6r hàtx5le wíða fèll6n,} hàtx5le wíða fèll6n.} rába m6ndiyáne
      y-awêðwala,} béna náše là h>m6níwa ""èlle díye.} ‘There was a man in a
      village who was a great liar. He would tell lies about people, say-
      ing so-and-so did such-and-such, so-and-so did such-and-such. He
      would do all kinds of (deceptive) things to them and people did not
      believe him.’ (A48:1)
  (8) xa-nàša} sìq5wa} l-†ùra} q†ála ""êrwe.} ‘A man had gone up into the
      mountains to kill sheep.’ (A31:1)
  (9) ""í°wa xa-màlka} ""áwwa málka xzéle xa-xêlma.} ""u-qédamta mère} . . . ‘There
      was (once) a king. This king had a dream. In the morning he said . . .’
      (A1:2)In (7)–(9) the nominal has a specific, unique referent. This is not, however,
the crucial feature that conditions the use of the particle. A nominal that
has a non-specific referent that plays a prominent role in the follow-
ing discourse is often marked with the particle due to this textual promi-
nence, e.g.
452                         chapter fourteen  (10) xa-náša y-azêlwa} ""í°wa ma°wá°a qurbˆni.} šaqèlwa ‘ánta mênne-u}
       máttu lèxma gàw,} y-azèlwa ‘yàda,} b7°a bˆ°a.} ‘A man would go to
       villages that were near us. He would take a bag with him, in
       which he put bread, and would go from house to house making
       invitations.’ (B5:20)
  (11) ""asqèxwa márz6 Zàwa.} šaqlèxwa xa-""êrba mènn6n,} ""u-""urxa-""ùrxa,}
       ""u-parmèxwale har-táma l-márz6 Zàwa.} ""u-y-oðèxwa nùra.} m†awêxwale
       táma.} ‘We would go up to the banks of the Zab. We would take
       a sheep with us and slaughter it there, on the trip, on the banks
       of the Zab. We would make a fire and roast it there.’ (B3:6)In (10) the phrase xa-náša does not refer to one specific man who would
take invitations to the villages each time there was a wedding. Rather the
sense is that one man went around on each occasion, but not necessarily the
same man, i.e. one unspecified item of the class denoted by the nominal.
Similarly in (11) xa-""êrba refers to one item of the class of sheep that was
slaughtered on each occasion, but obviously not the same item.
   In (12) both the man and the woman play a prominent role in the
ensuing discourse. The nominal phrase containing the two coordinated
nouns is treated as a unit and has only one indefinite particle:  (12) ""í°wa xa-gáw‰a-w bàxta.} ""í°wala bnòne.} ‘There was a husband and
       wife. They had children.’ (A 22:1)We may include in this category the regular use of the indefinite particle
before a noun denoting a period of time in adverbial expressions with
enduring relevance in that they set the temporal frame for the following
discourse. The most common adverbial construction of this nature in
narratives is xa-yoma ‘one day’, e.g.  (13) xá-yoma qèry5le mère †la-réš6t mà°a} ""áwwa šêmma mšax6lpùle.} ‘One day
       he appealed to the head of the village saying “Change this name.”’
       (A7:2)
  (14) xa-yóma síqe-wawa l-ßˆda.} ‘One day they had gone up (the moun-
       tains) hunting.’ (A25:2)
  (15) xa-yòma} qímla zílla mêra} t-áz6x l-""êrwe.} ‘One day they set off and
       said “Let’s go to the sheep.”’ (A25:23)In (16), which occurs at the beginning of a narrative, the frame setting
adverbial and the two protagonists are all marked with the indefinite
particle:
                           the syntax of nominals                              453  (16) xá-yoma ""í°wa xá-qaša ""u-xà-malla.} ‘One day there was a priest and
       a mullah.’ (A2:1)(ii) Contrasted members of a set
There is a tendency to use the particle when the indefinite nominal is
presented as one member of a limited set of items in some kind of con-
trastive opposition to other members of the set. The set is assumed to be
identifiable, either since it is mentioned explicitly or at least implied. In such
cases the nominal has salience due to this contrastive opposition, e.g.  (17) ""ap-ánna p7ši trè jwíne.} xa-jwìna} gawàye,} xà} qam-t9ra.} ‘They again
       form two teams, one team inside and one outside.’ (B11:11)
  (18) qím5le ""ap-Fárxo šqíl6lle zòrna,} mxáya zòrna,} bejíye hóla xa-gòta} ""èrwa
       xa-gòta.} ‘Farxo also took up the pipe and played pipe music, the
       young lambs were one side and the sheep on one (other) side.’
       (A25:31)In some cases only one member of the set is explicitly given, the other
members being implied. This is often found in clauses containing a uni-
versal quantifier, in which the construction has a distributive sense, e.g.  (19) q6m-mpatpêtla} kút-xa q6m-xašèlle ða-gòta.} ‘He tore them apart and
       threw everybody down to one side.’ (A25:56)
  (20) kút-yum ðà-brata gawèrwa.} ‘Every day he would marry a girl.’
       (A14:1)
  (21) b5°-qòra,} ""an-náše mì°e} ""áni y-amrèxxa b5°-qòra.} fa-y-azìwa.} kút-xa ""ítle
       xa-mì°a.} ‘The cemetery, (in which were) the dead people, we
       call the place they lie (literally: we call them) the cemetery. The
       people would go (there). Each person has a dead (family member).’
       (B5:56–57)
  (22) díya kút-b5°a ""ítle xa-tanùra.} ‘Now every house has an oven.’
       (B10:93–94)
  (23) °áni yóm6t ""éða y-oðêxwa duxràna.} kút-xa maßléwa xà-lag>na.} ‘On the
       second day of the festival (of Easter) we would make a memorial.
       Everybody would take down a pan (of food).’ (B10:2)The distributive sense is expressed in (24) and (25) by the repetition of
the particle:
454                          chapter fourteen  (24) xá-b-xa b7°a y-orêxwa gáwe mbarxêxwa ""éða.} ‘We would go into one
       house after another and offer festival blessings.’ (B6:15)
  (25) xa-xá-ga már6t b7°a mbašèlwa ""ixála ""ím6-t hóya dàn6t ""ixála.} ‘Sometimes
       (i.e. on one occasion and on another occasion) the owner of the
       house would cook food when it was time for food.’ (B6:16)In a related construction, the particle is used with the adjective xena
(f. xeta) ‘other’ in references to a further member of a set of items that is
assumed to be identifiable, e.g.  (26) pal†íwa m6n-bˆ°a} y-oríwa gu-xa-b7°a xèna.} ‘They would leave one
       house and enter another house.’ (B15:7)
  (27) ""áp-xa lì° láxxa gu-b7°a.} ""ayále díye hóle mšùdr6lla xa-dúk°a xéta.}
       ‘There is nobody here in the house. He has sent his children to
       another place.’ (A22:28)
  (28) ""íman t-à°y6t,} ða-k6sta-xéta max-d-áy yawênn6x.} ‘When you come
       back, I’ll give you another purse like that one.’ (A4:16)When the indefinite noun has a possessive pronominal suffix and so denotes
one member of a set of items in the possession of the referent of the suffix,
the particle is obligatory, e.g. xa-xòri ‘a friend of mine’ (B15:88), xa-xóni ‘a
brother of mine’ (A18:16), xa-nàši ‘a relative of mine’ (A18:16), xa-màmi
‘a maternal uncle of mine’ (B8:7), xá-""6rw6n ‘a sheep of ours’ (A10:5).(iii) Portion of a mass
The particle is used with a noun that by itself denotes an undelimited
mass to express a single countable portion of this mass, e.g.  (29) qàša} ""u-šamàša} ""i-mßàli} b-réše-u b7°a d7r5 míye b-réše dìye.} ""u-máxa
       xa-mèšxa gu-be-""éne dìye.} ‘The priest and the deacon pray over
       him and his family and they put water on his head. They put
       some oil on his forehead.’ (B6:36)
  (30) màsta} xèlya m5°êxxe,} mar6°xêxxe.} qày6r xán‘i.} d7r6x xa-màsta gáwe,}
       p7ša màsta.} ‘Yoghurt—we would fetch milk and boil it. It would
       cool slightly. We would put a portion of yoghurt in it and it would
       become yoghurt.’ (B10:26)
  (31) ""u-talíle b-xa-qˆsa.} ‘They hang it onto a piece of wood.’ (B6:38)Similarly, nouns meaning ‘piece of ’ or the like are typically preceded by
the particle, e.g. xa-qê††6t qˆsa} ‘a piece of wood’ (B10:100).
                           the syntax of nominals                             455  A noun of mass is given the particle when its description is delimited
by an attributive modifier of some kind and is thereby presented as one
member of a set of types, e.g.  (32) ""í°wa xa-""ùpra} m6šxàna,} ""úpra smòqa.} ‘There was an oily clay, red
       clay.’ (B10:68)(iv) Focus on unity
The particle is regularly used when the speaker wishes to give prominent
focus to the unity or uniqueness of the referent. This focus is expressed
on the prosodic level by putting the nuclear stress on the particle, e.g.  (33) ""í°wal6n šawwá ""abòne} gu-má°a dìy6n.} píšela mútte gu-Mar-Qiyóma kúlla
       gu-ðà qáwra.} ‘We had seven bishops in our village. They were all
       laid in one grave in (the church of) Saint Qiyoma.’ (B2:6)
  (34) ""ána xà-yoma kèslux la-p7š6n.} ‘I won’t stay with you a single day
       (longer).’ (A12:40)
  (35) ""ána ðà-brat5n.} ‘I am an only daughter.’ (A34:7)14.1.2.2. Particle Omitted
The indefinite marker tends to be omitted in the following circumstances, in
which the referent of the nominal is low in individuation and salience.(i) Nominals with a referent that play an incidental role in text
Nominals often lack the indefinite marker when their referent does not
play a prominent, durable role in the text, but is only incidental and is
part of supportive background material. In (1), for example, the ‘old
man’ marked with the particle has a degree of durability of reference,
but the ‘load of wood’ that he was carrying and the ‘stone’ on which he
was stitting are incidental. Likewise in (2) the ‘basket’ in which the eggs
and bread were placed plays no significant role in the text. In all cases
the nominals have specific referents:  (1)   xa-náša sàwa} ""úmre díye . . ., yá'ni dèqne díye m†áya l-9ra,} hóle †ína
        k7rt6t qˆse} l-xàße.} hóle tíwa l-kèpa,} hàtxa.} ""ánna pìð6lla mênne díye,}
        ""ap-šlàma l7la dèry6lle.} ‘An old man, whose age . . . that is his beard
        reached the ground, was carrying a load of wood on his back.
        He was sitting on a stone, like this. They passed by him, but did
        not even greet him.’ (A15:13)
456                           chapter fourteen  (2) mšádr6n m5xòlta ""èlle díye,} ""ixàla.} qìmt5la,} šlìqta} bè""e,} šàwwa bé""e.}
      ""u-mutt7°5la †¬á°i lêxme} gu-‘ànta.} mêra bábi náb6lla gu-jàma} hàlle!} ‘ “I
      shall send food to him, some food.” She boiled eggs, seven eggs,
      and put thirty loaves of bread in a basket. She said “Father, take
      them to the mosque and give them to him.” ’ (A17:11)The omission of the particle with the word m6ndi ‘thing’ can be explained
in the same way in (3) and (4), where it refers to something that is inciden-
tal and not referred to in what follows. By contrast in (5) and (6), where
m6ndi has the particle, it refers to something that is talked about in the
ensuing discourse:  (3) ""á°6t ""ána mbàšl6n mèndi.} ‘Come and I shall cook something.’
      (A22:14)
  (4) tìwle,} xílle mêndi} ‘He sat down and ate something.’ (A15:1)
  (5) ""ána ""áxxa nšéli xa-mêndi.} ‘I have forgotten something here.’ (The
      speaker then goes on to talk about the thing he had forgotten to
      mention earlier) (B5:35)
  (6) ""ám6r ""èlla dìya} t-amrênn6x xa-mêndi.} mèra mùr.} ‘He said to her “I
      shall tell you something.” She said “Tell (me).” ’ (A16:7)In some cases the particle is omitted before a nominal with a referent that
has a certain durability in the ensuing clauses of a section of discourse,
but lacks textual salience due to the fact that the section of discourse in
question is not in the foreground of the disourse as a whole, but supplies
background information. This applies to (7), in which the ‘lion’ clearly
plays a dominant role in the chain of clauses that is cited, but these are
not in the main foreground of the narrative, but rather provide explana-
tory background information as to how the protagonist of the section
lost his hand:  (7) zílle xa-béna ""árya °éle †álbe dìye,} ""áwwa q†ìlle †la-""árya,} ""ína ""árya ""íðe
      díye q6m-axêlla.} ‘A lion once attacked him. He killed the lion, but
      the lion ate his hand.’ (A11:1)(ii) Listing members of a set
In contexts where a member of a set is presented as one of a list of many
rather than being presented in distinct opposition to another member, the
particle is sometimes omitted, e.g.
                           the syntax of nominals                             457  (8)   qímle ""áqla xéta . . . q6m-parêmla.} ‘He cut off another leg (one of a
        series).’ (A22:5),(iii) Where the existence of a referent is negated or questioned
In negative or interrogative constructions that deny or question the exis-
tence of a referent, where the nominal clearly does not denote a referent
that saliently stands out from the class of items denoted by the description
of the noun, the particle is often omitted, e.g.  (9)  la-bàba ""ítle,} la-yêmma ""ítle.} ‘He has neither a father nor a
       mother.’ (A14:16)
  (10) har-""àww5le} ""6n-""ítle nawàge,} ""6n-""ítle bàba,} ""6n-""ítle yêmma,} ""6n-""ítle
       xon>wà°a?} ‘Is he alone or does he have grandchildren, does he
       have a father, does he have a mother, does he have brothers?’
       (A17:16)
  (11) m-7ka m5°ênnux nasàrta} ta-t-nasrênnux qˆse t-oðênnux gêšra,} šáwr6x
       réše réše dìye?} ‘From where should I bring you a saw so that I could
       saw the wood to make a bridge, over which we could cross?’
       (A17:3)
  (12) Mar-Yu˙ánna lá-mßele kút-xa dréle qáww6t míya b-rèše.} ‘Saint John
       could not put a scoop of water over everybody.’ (B6:10)When, however, the noun is presented as standing out distinctly as a single
individual member of a identifiable set, the particle may be used. In (13),
for example, the phrase xa-s6ryóqa has the sense of ‘not even one single
member of the set of twigs’:  (13) m5°íwa s6ryòqe,} †árpa q>†íwa y-azìwa.} m5°íwa ""an-q7se naqìðe.} kúlla
       torêxwala.} ""áxni la-morêxwa xa-s6ryóqa gu-b7°a ""6n-la-torêxwale.}
       torêxwala kúlla baràye.} ‘They would bring thin pieces of wood. We
       would break them all. We would not bring a single twig into the
       house without breaking it. We would break everything outside.’
       (B10:70)(iv) Focus on descriptive content
The particle tends to be omitted in a variety of contexts in which atten-
tion is being directed to the description or descriptive content of the
nominal rather than to a referent. This is clear in cases such as (14) and
(15) in which a specific referent of a nominal is first introduced into the
narrative by a phrase containing the particle and then the definition of
458                         chapter fourteenthe descriptive content of the nominal is clarified in a subsequent clause,
in which the nominal is indefinite but without the particle:  (14) ""ì°wa} xa-ràbb6n,} tíw5wa gu-xa-g6ppì°a.} . . . ràbb6n} y>ð6t-mà-yle?}
       ràbb6n} ""áwwa t-i-sàx6ð l-""álaha} ""u-t-i-mßàle-u} lé-y-""ax6l bêsra-w}
       ""áw y-amríle ràbb6n.} ‘There was once a monk who lived in a
       cave. . . . Do you know what a monk is? A monk is somebody who
       worships God, who prays and does not eat meat. He is called a
       monk.’ (A15:1–4)
  (15) múttela xa-sáll6t mìya.} múttela qam-""aqla°èy.} sáll6t míya y8ð6t
       mˆla?} béna míya kèlye gu-sàlla?} ‘They had put out a basket of water,
       they put it in front of their legs. Do you know what a basket of
       water is? But, can water stay in a basket?’ (A16:9–10)Similarly in (16) the first mention of ‘a mountain’ introduces a specific
referent and has the particle, whereas the following occurrence of the noun
without the particle occurs in an appositional phrase that is intended to
clarify the descriptive content of ‘a mountain’:  (16) síqela gu-xa-†ùra,} †úra ""isáre ramàne.} ‘They went up into a moun-
       tain, a mountain (with) high rocks.’ (A15:13)In (17) the first noun ‘a board’ introduces a referent, but the second
noun ‘a ladder’ in the double object construction (‘to make something
into something’) denotes a change of description rather than a change
of referent:  (17) qím5le mtúrß6lla xa-tàxta,} wíð6lla semàlta.} ‘He constructed a
       board and made it into a ladder.’ (A17:23)Similarly the particle is omitted when attention is directed to the descrip-
tion of the class denoted by a noun rather than to a particular referent
representing the class, e.g.  (18) báxta xá‘‘a zàbbun-ila.} ‘A woman is rather weak.’ (A10:12)Further examples where the description or descriptive content is the main
concern of the speaker:
                           the syntax of nominals                          459  (19) ""8raq—""í°wa masìna.} masína mturáßt5wa m-""ùpra.} ‘As for arak,
       there was (a pot called a) masina. A masina was made from clay.’
       (B5:14)
  (20) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle ¬a°ì-yome.} ‘A week
       for us is seven days and a month is thirty days.’ (A17:13)
  (21) ""ína wír5le gáwe díye ""àrya} ""u-plí†5le tèla.} ‘A lion entered it and
       a fox came out (i.e. he entered proudly like a lion but came out
       stealthily like a fox).’ (A17:34)A noun that is a predicate in a copula clause and ascribes a descriptive
property to the subject frequently lacks the particle, e.g.  (22) ""áwwa-ži zamàr5le.} ‘He is a singer.’ (A11:4)
  (23) ""ána ""6dl7le ""árxa t-áw6n láxxa kêsl6x.} ‘Tonight I shall be a guest in
       your home.’ (A17:24)
  (24) ""u-xètna l-b7°a pˆšena.} ‘I shall become a son-in-law in the house.’
       (A17:35)If, however, a noun is qualified by an attributive description in the contexts
described above, there is a greater tendency for it to be given the indefinite
particle, since by such qualification its individuation is increased, e.g.  (25) b6llòrta ""ítla.} mattêxla qa-yála zòra,} mattèxxa wàßla,} xa-wáßla
       rakìxa.} ‘It had a pipe. We set it up for a young child, we set up
       a joining piece, a soft joining piece.’ (B10:77)
  (26) ""áti xa-náša xaràm6t.} ‘You are a villainous man.’ (A16:11)
  (27) dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.} ‘The dawla
       is a box the top of which is open and in which they put wheat.’
       (B6:54)14.1.3. Stress Placement
There is no clear-cut phonological difference between the usage of the
particle xa as a cardinal numeral and its usage as a marker of indefinite-
ness. As a general rule, however, the particle is stressed when acting as a
cardinal numeral in opposition to another cardinal, e.g.,  (1)   ""í°wa xá-""ot6x yan-trè.} ‘There was one room or two.’ (B5:199)
  (2)   xalmìwa} xà-si†a} yan-trè-si†e} ‘They become one span or two spans
        thick.’ (B5:207)
  (3)   p5šíwa xá-l5le trè.} ‘They stayed for one night or two.’ (B5:234)
460                         chapter fourteenWhen functioning as a marker of indefiniteness the stress most commonly
falls on the nominal, as can be seen in the examples cited above. Retrac-
tion of the stress onto the particle occurs in some cases. This is found
mainly in the following contexts:(i) Temporal or spatial adverbial expressions:
   (4) xàr°a} xá-yoma síqa l-gàre.} ‘Then, one day, he went up onto the
       roof.’ (A14:87)
   (5) ""áyya xá-šeta hóla támma láxxa l7la mbaqorêllux.} ‘They have been here
       for a year but have not asked for you.’ (A26:78)
   (6) ""áw máßli xá-duk°a t-óya šaxínta y-amrèxwa gòma.} ‘They deposit it in
       a warm place that we called a goma.’ (B5:211)
   (7) málla Naßrádin xá-ga b>yéwa mbašèlwa pà‘a.} ‘Once mullah Naßradin
       wanted to cook pa‘a.’ (A5:1)
   (8) tíwela xá-bena hàd6x.} ‘They sat for a while like that.’ (A26:17)(ii) Before nouns that are annexed to a following noun:
    (9) xá-zawg6t xoriyà°a} ‘a pair of willow trees’ (A26:90)
    (10) xá-palg6t sà""6t} ‘half an hour’ (A10:5)
    (11) xá-boy6t xùwwe} ‘a snake’s hole’ (A9:6)
    (12) xá-bor6t kèpe} ‘a pile of stones’ (A11:5)The same applies to functionally similar constructions such as (13) and
(14), in which the indefinite noun is combined with a following noun in
apposition:  (13) xá-†ena q7sa ‘a load of wood’ (A14:9)
  (14) xá-reša tùma} ‘a head of garlic’ (B10:19)(iii) Nouns qualified by the modifier ‘other’:
    (15) ""è°y5le xá-naša xèna.} ‘Another man came.’ (A12:9)
    (16) xàr°a} t-á°e xá-""eða xréna zòra} ‘Afterwards comes another small fes-
         tival.’ (B6:8)(iv) Before the word m6ndi ‘thing’:
   (17) hálli xá-m6ndi t-àxl6n.} ‘Give me something to eat.’ (A26:57)
   (18) b>y6x xá-m6ndi gu-t9ra qablítula.} ‘We want you to pledge something
         for her at the door.’ (B10:36)
                            the syntax of nominals                        461  (19) ""at-y8ð6t xá-m6ndi bas-dìye?} ‘Do you know something about it?’
  (20) xá-mdi xwàra} ‘something white’ (A14:28)14.1.4. Suffixed Cardinal Indefinite Particle
The suffixation of the cardinal particle xa to the noun is attested in the
phrase xabra-xa in (1) below. The particle here expresses the internal
uniformity of the referent (‘consensus, agreement’) rather than its indi-
viduation:  (1) ""áw-w bàxta,} Č6lk9ze} ""o-yàla,} wídla xàbra-xa.} ‘He and the woman, that
      is Č6lk>ze and the young man, made an agreement.’ (A12:37)14.1.5. Pronominal Use of Indefinite Particle
The cardinal particle xa/ða can be used as an indefinite pronoun inde-
pendently of a noun, e.g.  (1) bèny6t-6lla ""ót6x tàma,} qá-t mabêsma kút-yom xà.} ‘You have built her
      a room there in order for her to entertain somebody everyday.’
      (A4:52)
  (2) ""ê°y5le xà""a.} ‘A certain person came.’ (A7:24)
  (3) ""u-""í°wa †awált6t b6rràne,} xa-ráqa bá°6r d-ò-xena.} ‘There was the game
      of “groups”, one person running after the other.’ (B7:6)
  (4) béna xá-m6nna mère de-yàlla!} ‘Then one of them said “Go for it!” ’
      (A44:3)
  (5) mú°y5le trè sus>wá°a.} xa-múxl6lle mêlxa.} ""u-xá har-múš6ty5le mìya.} ‘He
      brought two horses. He fed one salt. One he only gave water to
      drink.’ (A34:31)Such indefinite pronouns can be qualified by an adjective, e.g.  (6) xa-gò‰5le.} ‘He is a great one (a great person).’ (A26:72)
  (7) d6-mxíli xa-xèna.} ‘Strike me another one (another blow)!’ (A52:24)If the referent is feminine, there is a greater tendency to use the feminine
form of the particle ða than there is when the particle is used before a
feminine noun, e.g.
462                           chapter fourteen  (8)  ""ína brón6t málka °èle} ""u-ðà mènne díye.} ‘Behold the son of the king
       has come and a girl is with him.’ (A14:93)
  (9) dawqíwa bná°a b-""íð6t ġðáðe hàtxa,} yá'ni ràbe doqíwa,} ða-dwíqta ""íð6
       d-a-xèta.} ‘The girls held each other’s hand like this. Many held
       (hands), one holding the hand of the other.’ (B12:1)
  (10) ""áyya Zíne ""í°6n trè""e.} ða-xà°ela} ""u-ða-bàxtela.} ‘There are two of
       such (women called) Zine. One is his sister and one is his wife.’
       (A26:61)
  (11) šqíl6lla m6n-d-5-dˆrta,} núbl6lla zêdy6lla gu-ða-xèta.} ‘They took it
       from that enclosure, took it away and threw it into another one.’
       (A15:12)
  (12) mutt7°6lla †6¬¬ê° x6mm6ryá°a,} m-an-xm6ryá°6 tabzìye.} mutt7°6lla r6š-párš6t
       ""ˆna,} ða-smòqta,} ða-xwàrta,} ða-milànta.} ‘She laid down three beads,
       beads of a rosary. She put them on the stone slab of the spring,
       one red, one white and one blue.’ (A25:34)A few exceptions are attested, such as (13) and (14), in which the feminine
form of the adjective xeta is combined with xa rather than ða:  (13) ðà-b-ða šáqla-w} mattá xa-xèta.} ‘She takes them (gutta°a f. balls of
       dough) one by one and puts another in.’ (B5:102)
  (14) ""ap-xa-xéta ""axlàla.} ‘She eats another one (another leg ""aqla f.).’
       (A18:21)
                                14.2. GenderWe shall restrict ourselves here to noting the use of the feminine singular
form of pronouns and verbal inflection in situations where they do not
refer to a distinct referent. These can be categorized as follows:14.2.1. Discourse Anaphora
Feminine singular forms are used to refer anaphorically to the general,
propositional content of the surrounding discourse, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-""áw6ð hàtxa,} lˆla spáy.} ‘If he does this, it is not good.’ (A14:6)
  (2)   ""áyy6t miràli ""êllux} kùlla wiðále.} ‘What I have told you—all of this
        he has done.’ (A24:20)
                          the syntax of nominals                             463  (3)  mxéli s7pa ""êlle,} ‘ú-m6ndi la-wìdla.} ‘I struck a sword into him, but
       that (action) did nothing.’ (A12:36)
  (4) xamlèxwa bìya.} ‘We enjoyed the occasion.’ (B5:33)
  (5) m-k6s-gàne q6m-mdabèrra} mxalóße xàye díye.} ‘He fabricated it (what he
       had just said) to save his life.’ (A39:6)
  (6) plì††5la} gu-mà°a,} kút-xa q†ála ġðàðe.} ‘It (what had happened) got
       about in the village and everyone fought with one another.’
       (A7:14)
  (7) hátxa la-hàwya.} ‘This cannot be.’ (A21:32)
  (8) šwiqáli táma-w °éli làxxa.} ‘I have left it (the situation of the narrative)
       there and come here’ (formula marking the end of a narrative).
       (A26:91)
  (9) b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Did you send for me because of this?’ (A21:35)
  (10) módi mqúma ""êllux?} ""o-qamáya miràle,} ""o-t-tré miràle.} ‘ “What has
       befallen you?” The first one told it (= the event) to him, the second
       one told it to him.’ (A17:31)The normally masculine noun m6ndi is construed as feminine singular in
(11), where it is singular, and (12), where it is plural, since in such cases it
refers anaphorically to the general, propositional content of what precedes
in the discourse, rather than to a specific referent:  (11) ""áyya mèndi lˆ-""a°ya l-manšóye.} ‘This thing is unforgettable.’ (B15:8)
  (12) rába gáye wít5la ""ánna m6ndiyàne.} ‘Many times such things happened.’
       (B5:163)In (13)–(15) the propositional content of what follows is referred to ana-
phorically by feminine singular inflection. In (13) the content in question
is that of a subordinate clause that is construed as the subject of the
preceding copula (l7la š6klánta). In (14) the feminine singular form píšt5la
refers to the proposition ‘the bees are going back and forth’. In (15) the
feminine singular copula in the disclaimer zàwd5la mènni ‘it is too much
for me’ refers to the content of the following speech of the speaker:  (13) ""6n-bábux ""u-yèmmux gu-bˆ°5la,} l7la š6klánta t-ásq6t l-gàre.} ‘If your
       father and mother are in the house, it is not pleasant for you to
       go up onto the roof.’ (D2:7)
  (14) ""u-píšt5la ""an-d6bbòre} har-zála-w °àya.} ‘The hornets continued going
       back and forth.’ (A20:8)
464                            chapter fourteen  (15) mìr-e-m6n} zàwd5la mènni,} ""ána t-amr6nnˆxu} mšáx6lpu dukàne.} ‘My lord,
       may I humbly suggest you change places (Literally: It is too much
       for me, let me say to you, change places).’ (A26:65)Expressions referring to mathematical operations are also treated as
feminine singular, e.g.  (16) tré-gaye tré wíta ""àrba.} ‘Two times two equals four.’
  (17) xámša gáye xámša wáy5la ""èsri-w xàmša.} ‘Five times five is twenty-
       five.’Infinitives, which refer to a general activity unbound to a particular point
in time, are usually construed as feminine in gender when they function
as arguments in a clause, e.g.  (18) qráya zàm6t-ila.} ‘Reading is difficult.’
  (19) mdaróye modìla?} ‘What is winnowing?’ (B5:97)Occasionally the inanimate interrogative pronoun ‘what?’ is treated as
feminine when it relates to a situation with propositional content rather
than a distinct referent, e.g.  (20) mo-t-á°ya b-rešˆni?} ‘What will come upon us?’14.2.2. General Speech Situation
In direct speech the feminine singular is used in various expressions to
refer to the general speech situation, e.g.  (1)   ""áxxa biš-salàm6t-ila.} ‘Here it is safer.’ (A30:51)
  (2)   há xèr,} mòdila?} ‘Is everything all right? What is it? (= What is the
        matter?)’ (A17:29)
  (3)   ßrìx5le} hàw6rila!} hàw6rila! b7°i qìdle!} ‘He cried “Woe! Woe! (literally:
        It is woe) My house has burnt down.” ’ (A48:2)
  (4)   xwí†la ""êlli.} ‘I am confused (literally: It is mixed up for me).’14.2.3. Temporal Expressions
The feminine singular is used in some temporal adverbial expressions to
refer to the general temporal situation in a narrative, e.g.
                           the syntax of nominals                               465  (1)  b-lˆlela,} plí††5la zìlt5la} xzí°6lle xa-nàša.} ‘(When) it was night, she
       went out and found a man.’ (A22:36)
  (2) wít5la b-lˆle} maláxa mŭ‰èšle qa-ràbb6n.} ‘In the night (literally: It
       became in the night) the angel woke the monk.’ (A15:11)
  (3) píšla b-lˆle,} sìq5le} l-gàre.} ‘In the night (literally: It became in the
       night), he went up onto the roof.’ (A25:52)
  (4) kpìnna} yóm6 †¬à°5la.} ‘She went hungry when the third day came.’
       (A21:16)
  (5) wít5la bar-""o-náša sáwa ßèly5le mt>mòz6lla ë6nn6k7ra díya,} ""áp-""aw ßèly5le
       mhayóre ta-d-o-sàwa.} ‘After the old man went down to clean around
       it (literally: It became after . . .), he also went down to help the old
       man.’ (A14:77)
  (6) hènt-ila t-à°e} ‘He will come very soon (literally: It is a little he will
       come).
  (7) ""u-šaqláwa qúrb6 l-""árbi, xamšì yomá°a.} ‘It would take about forty or
       fifty days.’ (B5:12)
  (8) mèdre ""i-zamríwa-w šatˆwa} hál y-oráwa gu-lˆle.} ‘They again sang
       and drank until it was night (literally: until it passed into night).’
       (B5:18)
  (9) zílta láxxa tre-†¬à-yarxe,} ""arbà-yarxe,} mère xa-béna xéta mjarbênna.} ‘Two or
       three months, four months passed. He said “I’ll test them again.” ’
       (A48:4)
  (10) píšla qúrb6t xà-yarxa} ""7-ga málka mère †la-bàxte} ‘Almost a month went
       by and then the king said to his wife . . .’ (A4:38)
  (11) y-oráwa kèma yàrxe.} ‘Several months would pass.’ (B5:18)
  (12) pal†a-bàh6r} y-oðèxwa ""ùpra.} ‘When Spring came, we would collect
       the mud.’ (B10:68)In (9)–(12) the fs. verb forms appear to take the following plural nouns as
their grammatical subject, but they should be interpreted as referring to
the general temporal situation: ‘(Time) went by (for) two or three months,
four months’, etc.","[490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504]"
"1.4.4. Emphatic /‰/
A phonetic explanation can be found for the development of emphatic
/‰/ in some words.
   It has sometimes arisen due to the original presence of the pharyngal
*', e.g.     ""am‰a                ‘wool’                     < *'amrà
     se‰a                 ‘goat’s hair’              < *sa'rà
     ‰ay6š                ‘he wakes’                 < *ra'6š < *ra8ešIt can also arise adjacent to a labial, e.g.     b6‰-naša             ‘human being’
     da‰mana              ‘medicine’In some minimal pairs in which /‰/ contrasts with /r/, the emphatic /‰/ is
a reflex of an originally geminated consonant, whereas the non-emphatic
/r/ is a reflex of a ungeminated consonant, e.g.     pa‰a                 ‘lamb’                     < *parrà
     para                 ‘dust’                     < *""pàrà     ma‰a                 ‘spade’                    < *marrà
     mara                 ‘to say’                   < *""màràIn several cases, however, the emphatic /‰/ is not motivated primarily by
a phonetic cause but rather has developed as means of distinguishing a
word from a homophone with a different meaning, e.g.     bera                 ‘well’                     < *b6""rà
     be‰a                 ‘light’                    < *b6hrà     nera                 ‘river’                    < *nahrà
     ne‰a                 ‘vision’                   < *nahrà
                               consonants                               59     dare                ‘he puts’                < *dàrè
     da‰e                ‘generations’            < *dàrè     parma               ‘she cuts’               < *pàrmà
     øa‰ma               ‘type of oak tree’The is no phonetic reason why one member of these pairs should develop
the /‰/ rather than the other. Indeed some such pairs have a common
etymological root, e.g.     gawra               ‘she marries’            < *gà∫rà
     gaw‰a               ‘man’                    < *ga∫rà     prama              ‘to slaughter’            < *pràmà
     ø‰ama              ‘to understand’           < *pràmàA trend is discernible with regard to the distribution of this type of
emphatic /‰/ across word categories. Where a verb and a noun are
being distinguished by this means, it is the noun rather than the verb that
acquires the emphatic /‰/:     Verb                                 Noun
     dare          ‘he puts’              da‰e        ‘generations’
     parma         ‘she cuts’             øa‰ma       ‘oak tree’
     gawra         ‘she marries’          gaw‰a       ‘man’
     dwara         ‘threshing’            dwa‰a       ‘rest area for sheep’1.4.5. Emphatic /ø/ and /¬/
The development of the marginal emphatic phonemes /ø/ and /¬/ has in
some cases been motivated by an etymological pharyngal *' in the word
in question, e.g.     ¬aya                ‘upper’                  < *'làyà
     ø6qqa               ‘crack’                  < *p6q'à
     mø>¬oye             ‘to imitate’             < *m-pl' < *m-pl8The word p6qqa ‘frog’ appears also to be derived from a form with
an original pharyngal (cf. Syr. peq'à, NENA C. Qaraqosh p6q""a). The
verb mø>¬oye, furthermore, appears to be a doublet of mp>loye ‘to share’
(< m-pl8). The absence of emphasis in these words is likely to be moti-
60                                chapter onevated by the desire to distinguish them from ø6qqa ‘crack’ and mø>¬oye ‘to
imitate’ respectively.
   The emphatic /ø/ in øa‰ma ‘type of oak tree’ and ø‰ama ‘to understand’
has developed as a means distinguishing the word from homophones of
different meaning, as is the case with the /‰/ in these words (cf. §1.4.4.).","[97, 98, 99]"

tions such as (19), in which the verb is repeated:  (19) qìmta} mgašóqe hàtxa,} mo-mgàšqa!} ‘She got up and looked and what
       (a sight) she sees!’ (A25:59)

       but what (a surprise when) he woke!’ (A14:30)The adverbial interrogative particle dax is used also in a longer form daxi.
The occurrence of the longer form is prosodically conditioned, in that it
occurs predominantly in pause at the end of an intonation group, as is
the case with the long forms of verbal inflections (§15.12.), e.g.  (22) dàxi?} ‘How (could this be)?’ (A25:69)
  (23) báxta dìya dáxi?} ‘Wife, now how (can we solve the problem)?’
       (A20:9)17.7.14. Negated Verbal Clauses17.7.14.1. Negative Particle before Verb
When a verbal clause is negated, the negative particle la is normally
placed immediately before the verb. Various stress patterns are attested
in relation to this particle. In some cases it is stressed and in others it is
unstressed (§6.4.). It takes the nuclear stress of the intonation group when
the speaker wishes to give the negation particular prominence. This is
found predominantly in the following circumstances.(i) Negated Deontic Expressions
When the negated verb has a deontic modality, such as a prohibition
addressed to the hearer or an expression of deontic intention by the
speaker, the negator is often given prominence, e.g.  (1)   là mtalpètle} là-daqr6t bíye.} ‘Do not harm him! Do not touch him!’
        (A26:73)
  (2)   là maßí°6t!} ‘Do not listen!’ (A26:11)
  (3)   là-mßaw°6t!} ‘Do not speak!’ (A26:89)
  (4)   bróni là q6†lúle!} ‘Do not kill my son!’ (A33:6)
  (5)   là maštóla míya!} ‘Do not give them water to drink!’ (A25:9)
  (6)   ""ána là-""a°6n mènnux!} ‘I shall not come with you!’ (A6:6)
  (7)   là-""awr6n gu-má°a!} ‘I shall not go into the village!’ (A25:34)
890                          chapter seventeen(ii) Adversative Contexts
The negator is given prominence when the clause defeats an expectation
that arises from what precedes, e.g.  (1) spírra spìrra} bróna díya là °éle.} ‘She waited and waited, but her son
      did not come.’ (A14:21)
  (2) ták-tak mxáy6lla goyá°6 sùsa} ta-t-dày6‰ súsa m-táma,} là-jwijle súsa.} ‘He
      struck the sides of the horse so that the horse would move away
      from there, (but) the horse did not move.’ (A26:28)
  (3) mèra t-ásq6n ta-t-axèlli xùwwe.} mère ""ána t-á°6n mênn6x.} ""áti xúwwe là
      ""axèll6x.} ‘She said “I am going up in order for the snake to eat
      me.” He said “I shall come with you. The snake will not eat you.” ’
      (A24:39)(iii) Contrastive Oppositions
When the negated clause is set up in a contrastive opposition with what
precedes, the negator, which is the focus of contrast, has the nucleus,
e.g.  (1) mèra ""ána báxt6t ""á©6t ô?l-iw6n.} ""áyya xmá°a díya homênna.} x6myána
      homênne.} bróna homênne.} kúlla homênna.} kál°a là homènna.} ‘She said “I
      am the wife of the a©a of ôàl.” Her mother-in-law believed it. Her
      father-in-law believed it. The son believed it. Everybody believed
      it. The daughter-in-law, however, did not believe it.” ’ (A19:2)
  (2) réši parmênne} ""u-réš6x là parmènne.} ‘I shall cut off my head. I shall not
      cut off your head’ (A14:35)(iv) Verb mßy ‘to be able’  (1) ""ána là-mß6n t-á°6n mènnux hátxa.} ‘I cannot come with you in that
      case.’ (A26:18)
  (2) ""ána là-mß6n ma°yánne.} ‘I cannot bring him back.’ (A25:75)
  (3) †¬á gáye súse dìye} °éle ta-t-šàw6r} là mßéle.} ‘Three times his horse came
      up to jump but could not do so.’ (A25:55)
  (4) zmìrra,} là-mßela bíyi.} ‘She sang and could not beat me.’ (A25:69)(v) Negator Combined with Intensifier
In some cases a negator with the nuclear stress is combined with the
intensifying particle xo-/xu-, e.g.
                                   the clause                                  891  (1) xo-là p7š6n š>vána-llux.} ‘I shall not become a shepherd for you.’
      (A25:32)
  (2) ""áxni b>yèxwa t-a°êxwa.} xu-là-mßaya t-a°èxwa t-amrèxwal6x.} ‘We wanted
      to come back, but we could not come back to tell you.’ (A14:21)
  (3) yába ""an-""èmma dàwe,} xu-là mbaqrêt6lli.} ‘Well, do not ask me about
      those hundred gold coins.’ (A14:65)17.7.14.2. Negative Particle before Other Constituents
The negative particle is sometimes placed before another component of
the clause that intervenes before the verb. This is found in the following
circumstances:(i) Verb Not in Scope of Negation
One context where this is found is where the scope of the negator
includes this item but not the verb. In order for it to be within the scope
of the negation, it must be in the focus component of the clause. There
is, therefore, a narrow focus on the negated item, with the verb being in
the presupposition. The nuclear stress is sometimes, though not regularly,
placed on the negator before the item in narrow focus, as in (1)–(4):  (1) xzèla} ""ína núra †èpya b-b7°e dìye,} ""ína là-b5°a qíða,} xá‘‘a q7se rè˙qa m6n-
      bˆ°e.} ‘They saw that fire had been kindled in his house, but his
      house had not burnt down, only a few sticks far from his house
      (had burnt).’ (A48:3)
  (2) ""è°yela hìw6lla} ""áy mèra lˆk6t naból6lli?} mère ""ána làn †láli naból6ll6x.}
      naból6ll6x †la-d-áwwa dewêrr6š.} ‘She said “Where are you taking me?”
      He said “I am not taking you for myself. I am taking you for this
      vagabond.” ’ (A12:35)
  (3) là-kulley yapáwa.} ‘Not all of them used to bake.’ (B5:17)
  (4) ""áx‘i là gu-""Ôn6 Núne q6m-""oðènne ""éða,} q6m-""oðènwale gu-Dòhok.} ‘But I did
      not spend the festival in ""“n-Nune, I spent it in Dohok.’ (B15:9)
  (5) lá kulla-náše y8ði t-oðìla.} ‘Not all people know how to make it.’
      (B10:22)
  (6) ""áxni lá raba-""i-map6lxêxwala.} ‘We do not use it much.’ (B10:18)
  (7) ""ilan5ni t-xabušta. m-reša-w š6tta mnoqašta. l-Yaws6p zwinta b-dabašta. nèmu
      ""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘ “Our
      tree is an apple tree. It is decorated above and below. It has been
      bought by Yaws6p for a beehive.” [wedding song] At the wedding
      of Gw6rg6s was it not my aunt who bought his cake and say “(I
      buy it) for a beehive?” ’ (B8:29–30)
  (8) xo-lán har-""ána gàw‰a.} ‘I am not the only man.’ (A26:79)
892                          chapter seventeenConstructions such as (9) and (10), in which the verb has been gapped,
can be included here:  (9)  ""áni maßlèxwa ""êrxe,} †axnêxwala.} là kúlla náše.} bas-""àxni.} ‘We brought
       them down to the water-mill and ground them. Not everybody,
       but we did (this).’ (B10:88)
  (10) mattátla xa-kawáz6t míya k6s-réša-w bàs,} la-""ixàla,} la-lêxma.} ‘You should
       put out for her a jar of water by her head and that’s all, not food,
       nor bread.’ (A21:10)In (11) the item in the scope of negation is placed after the verb, with the
negative particle used both before this item and the verb:  (11) lá d5r7le là r6š-séla} ""i-maxíle gu-tanùra.} ‘They do not place it on a
       griddle, they place it in the oven.’ (B6:49)(ii) Constituents Coordinated in a Set Relation
The negative particle is placed before a subject constituent when the latter
is placed at the front of a clause in order to establish it in a set relationship
with an item in a coordinated adjacent clause and the scope of negation
includes the subject, e.g.  (1)   la-k yàsa m>ráwa} ""u-la-xàßa m>réwa,} la-∂á©a† y-awèwale.} ‘(One’s) stom-
        ach did not ache, (one’s) back did not ache and one did not have
        (high blood) pressure.’ (B5:31)
  (2)   ""ána lˆ-gor6n,} la-""àti gáwr6t.} ‘I shall not marry, so long as you do not
        marry.’ (A25:83)
  (3)   la-""áxnix xàla} ""u-lá sus>wà°6n xála.} ‘Neither are we eating nor are
        our horses eating.’ (A26:16)If the items that are coordinated in a set relationship across a series of
two or more clauses are not subject constituents, a second negator is often
placed before the item in question, in addition to a negator in the normal
position in the clause, e.g.  (4)   lá-karmi l5le-m>dò‰e} ""u-la-˙áqq6t kàrmi l5le-yáwa.} ‘He does not return
        my orchard nor does he pay the price.’ (A17:30)Constituents that are coordinated in this way include the resultative par-
ticiple and infinitive of compound verbal constructions, e.g.
                                   the clause                                  893  (5)   ""o-déwa l7le lá plìxa} ""u-lá zêrya} ""u-lá xzìda.} ‘That wolf has neither
        worked, nor cultivated, nor harvested.’ (A10:3)We see from (5) that the items are not necessarily placed at the front of
the clause but may remain in their normal position.
   The verb may be gapped after the first clause of the coordinated series,
e.g.  (6)   ""ána lànwa wíða} là x6rbayú°a} là spayú°a †la-‘ú-naša.} ‘I have not done
        evil or good to anybody.’ (A14:23)
  (7)   ""ána làn dmíxa,} là-b-l5le,} là-b-yoma.} ‘I have not slept, neither at night
        nor during the day.’ (A24:24)
  (8)   lá-b>y6x la-mìya} ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘We do not want water or anything
        else.’ (A39:12)A series of negated verbal predicates may be coordinated with this type
of construction, e.g.  (9)   šuréle mtaxmòne.} gu-d-áy taxmànta} †¬á yomàne} l7le la-xíla-w la-šêtya} ""u-
        la-dmìxa.} ‘He began to think. He was (immersed) in this musing
        for three days without eating or drinking or sleeping.’ (A26:19)In (10) the Arabic particle walla ‘and not’ is used by the speaker in this
type of construction:  (10) le-šóq6n lá xolamwà°a} wálla ""àti} wálla yêmmi} wálla ‘u-nàša.} ‘I shall not
       let servants, you, mother or anybody (look after them).’ (A8:18)Similar constructions are attested with existential particles, in which the
negator is either repeated (11) or is placed only before the item in focus
(12):  (11) lí° là-xmara mènne díye} la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There was not an ass with him,
       nor anything (else).’ (A22:25)
  (12) la-bàba ""ítle,} la-yêmma ""ítle.} ‘He does not have a father and he does
       not have a mother.’ (A14:16)The unusual construction in (13) with the sequence la ""itle rather than
litle may perhaps be understood in this light. The noun nx6p°a ‘shame’ is
established in a set relationship with what precedes in order to explain
the meaning of the latter:
894                         chapter seventeen  (13) xzí hátxa be-nxêp°5le.} lá ""ítle nxêp°a} ‘Look, he is so shameless. He
       has no shame.’ (A6:11)In certain circumstances a negative particle is placed before an infinitive
that is the complement of a main verb if only the infinitive is in the scope
of the negation, e.g.  (14) ""u-kút-xa mšuréle là-dwaqa míya.} ‘Everybody began (to agree) not to
       gather water.’ (A24:43)(iii) Asseveration
The negative particle may be used to express asseveration rather than
negation, especially to dispell possible doubt after questions. In such cases
the particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.","[927, 928, 929, 930, 931, 932, 933]"
"15.6.1. The Nominal Nature of the Verbal Noun
The verbal noun is treated syntactically in most respects like other nouns.
It may be used in a clause in positions that are appropriate for nouns, such
as subject position (1–2) or the complement of a preposition (3–5):  (1) dán6t plí†la qyàmta.} šahárta qa-t-qyàmta pál†a.} ‘The time when the
      resurrection has come. They keep vigil until the resurrection comes
      out.’ (B5:54)
  (2) bár parqáwa qyàmta.} ‘After the resurrection (ceremony) had finished . . .’
      (B5:56)
  (3) ""u-""áyya gu-dyà‰ta} mòdi wídla?} ‘What did she do on her return?’
      (A19:4)
  (4) ""6n-b>yèxwa tùma,} †la-mbašàlta,} kèf6nile.} ‘If we wanted (to use) garlic
      for cooking, it was up to us.’ (B10:24)
  (5) mhày6rri} b6d-taxmàntux.} ‘Help me with your thought (on this matter).’
      (A21:2)A nominal denoting the subject or object participant of the activity
expressed by the verbal noun must be combined with the verbal noun

verbs in this respect and have their participants juxtaposed. Examples:(i) Subject   (1) qyámt6t màran} ‘the resurrection of our Lord’ (B5:55)
   (2) gu-práqt6t ""aßêrta,} bar-prìqla,} m5°7wa juwàla.} ‘At the end of the evening,
       after they finished, they would bring a sack.’ (B5:86)
   (3) b-zòr-áa¬e} †la-mapláxt6t bˆ°a.} ‘It is scarcely enough for the household
       to use.’ (B5:215)(ii) Object   (1) xyápt6t xêtna} ‘the washing of the groom’ (B15:74)
   (2) zrét6t rêzza} ‘the cultivating of rice’ (B5:76)
   (3) palá††6t ""9raq} ‘the production of arak’ (B5:12)
   (4) mtaráßt6t xèlya ‘the preparation of milk’ (B5:173)
   (5) ""u-qaÄèxwa yóma qamáy6t ""èða,} baráxt6t ""éða xa-d-o-xèna.} ‘We would
       spend the first day of the festival offering festival blessings to one
       another.’ (B15:8)15.6.2. Cognate Verbal Nouns
Verbal nouns are used with their cognate verbs in various contexts. It is
found in anaphoric expressions such as those in (1) and (2), which express
a perfective and iterative activity respectively:   (1) ""u-píš5le gu-d-5-pyàšta} há-t-ila °í°a ""ámte dìye.} ‘He remained in that
       situation until his aunt came.’ (A23:7)
   (2) ""u-""an-baxtà°a} kapšìwale,} napßíwale gu-d-a-npàßta} ""u-mattíwale l-qóma bá°6r
       xàßey.} ‘The women would gather it and shake it with the shaking
       ( just mentioned) and put it into a pile behind their back.’ (B5:85)Similar anaphoric constructions are used in which the finite verb occurs
in a preceding clause, e.g.   (3) mèra qú ßli-xzì!} . . . gu-d-7 ßl5°èy} qá†u wìrt5la.} ‘She said “Go down
       and see!” While they were coming down (like this), a cat came in.’
       (A4:52–53)
738                           chapter fifteenA verbal noun is used with a cognate finite verb to express the intensity
of a single perfective action, e.g.  (4) °éle tálga xa-°ˆ°a.} ‘Snow came with a (great) coming’ (i.e. it snowed
      heavily).’ (A25:41)The use of a cognate verbal noun can be used to give additional mor-
phological coding to a perfective event to mark a boundary in the dis-
course. This is the case with (5), in which the clause in question marks a
an episodic boundary:  (5) qlábta díya qlìbla} ""u-kúlle bêrya} y-amrèxxe xa-kerábso ‘She returned her
      return (= When she returned) and it had all grown into (the plant)
      we call kerabso.’ (A34:17)15.6.3. The Verbal Noun Combined with the Verb ‘to be’
On some occasions the verbal noun is combined with the verb ‘to be’
following the model of compound verbal forms with the infinitive. This
construction expresses an iterative action, by presenting one representative
occurrence of the action. The compound infinitive construction can express
the same iterative sense (§15.4.2.4.). Examples from the text corpus:  (1) hár mkapášt6t kisyá°6t dàwela tóto.} ‘The old woman is all the time col-
      lecting bags of gold.’ (A4:22)
  (2) rqàðt5la-w} xálta-w štˆ°5la.} ‘They are dancing, eating and drinking.’
      (A14:46)
  (3) warwàrt5la-w} ‘It (the bear) roars.’ (A27:29)
  (4) maplàšt5w6lley} yèn mattèxwaley gu-ßàwle.} ‘They would knock them
      together or we would put them in shoes.’ (B15:5)
  (5) ""6n-t-áwe jwàjta,} b-šàx6n.} ‘If he moves (on one occasion), he warms
      up.’ (B11:16)Note that the verbal noun in (4) maplàšt5w6lley expresses the pronominal
object with an ""6ll- phrase.
   In (6) a verbal noun construction is juxtaposed with an infinitive con-
struction. The former can be interpreted as expressing the iterated single
events of the animal’s roaring and the latter as denoting a continuous
activity of singing:
                             the syntax of verbs                               739  (6)   ""ay-wàðt5la} n>ra-n8ra dìya} ""u-""áw zmàr5le bíya.} ‘She is giving off her
        roar and he is singing along with her.’ (A27:14)In (7), where the subject in the English translation is non-volitional, the
copula takes the verbal noun as its grammatical subject:  (7)   qarqárte dìyela} ‘He made a squeaking noise (literally: there is his
        squeaking).’ (A30:9)In (8) the form jnanya°a can be interpreted as the plural of the verbal noun
jnanta and, therefore, expresses a plurality of individual actions:  (8)   qímela ""ê°ye.} ""7-bena ""áxxa kúlla jnanyà°5la.} ""7-ga zmár5la b-tábut dìye.}
        ‘They came and there they all lamented and sang (dirges) over his
        coffin.’ (A26:83)
                        15.7. The Imperative FormIn most cases the imperative form is used perfectively to command the
performance of a single delimited action with a clear start and endpoint,
e.g.  (1)   prúmu rèše!} ‘Cut off his head!’ (A24:31)
  (2)   hallúle ""álpa dàwe!} ‘Give him a thousand gold pieces!’ (A1:14)
  (3)   šqúlla yalêx°a!} ‘Take the scarf !’ (A4:18)
  (4)   diya-m7°u júlli malušùla!} ‘Now bring my clothes and put them on
        (me)!’ (A4:20)
  (5)   wúð ða-spayú°a mênni!} ‘Do me a favour!’ (A7:17)
  (6)   háyyo ßlí K>r≈m ""áti gu-d-áwwa balù'a.} ‘Come Karim, go down into
        this conduit!’ (A14:16)Prohibitions may be expressed by negating an imperative form by the
negative particle la. If this particle is combined with the verb in a stress
group it typically takes the stress, e.g.  (7) lá-wuð qàla!} ‘Do not make a noise!’ (A30:44)
  (8) lá-mur hàtxa!} ‘Do not say that!’ (A26:52)
  (9) bróni là q6†lúle!} ‘Do not kill my son!’ (A33:6)

740                          chapter fifteenOn some occasions the imperative is used to command or prohibit a less
clearly delimited action. In (11) and (12), for example, the imperatives
‘work!’ and ‘search!’ respectively clearly command the inception of the
action but do not necessarily imply an endpoint. In (13) the actions com-
manded by the imperatives are most easily interpreted as iterative. The
speaker is referring to the annual custom of Kurds to bring sheep into
the village during transhumance and intends his command to apply to
all future years.  (11) xuš-plùx6n!} ta-mú-t ba†íla tíwa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Go and work! Why are you
       sitting idly in the house?’ (A39:1)
  (12) †ó-l5xu xa-šúla ta-t-x8yitu bìye!} ‘Search for a job for yourselves by
       which you may make a living!’ (A30:1)
  (13) lá-masqu l-gár6t ""ùmra!} m-gu-gár6t ""úmra hóla náblula t>máha rê˙qa!}
       †la-mótu m5°óy6lla gár6t ""ùmra?} ‘Don’t take them onto the roof. Take
       them far away from the roof of the church. Why do you bring
       them on the roof of the church?’ (B18:7)In (14) and (15) the imperatives are negated by the particle bassa ‘enough!’
and command the end of an activity that is already in progress without
any implied starting point:  (14) bássa bxˆg6n} bássa wuð-tàzi.} ‘Do not weep any more! Do not mourn
       any more!’ (A26:88)
  (15) bássa ští ""u-rwì!} ‘Don’t drink any more and get any more drunk!’On numerous occasions the imperative is preceded by the particle of
immediacy d6-/de-. Most attested examples are positive commands, e.g.  (16) d6-šqúl ""anna-zùze!} ‘Take these coins!’ (A1:27)
  (17) d6-šùqla!} ‘Leave it!’ (A5:7)
  (18) de-mùrri!} ‘Tell me!’ (A4:26)
  (19) de-wúr gu-d-áwwa gùrba!} ‘Go into this torso!’ (A14:67)The particle may be placed before an adverb of immediate time refer-
ence, such as ‘today’ in (20):  (20) de-""êdyo,} qu-p7g6n kàde!} ‘Today, get up and bake kade cakes!’

can be used deontically to express commands or prohibitions. This may
be used perfectively to express single delimited actions, e.g.  (22) súsux b8ye t-kàle.} là-šoq6t t-kále.} máx6t ""èlle díye ta-t-""ás6q pày6dle ""o-†úra.}
       ‘Your horse will want to stop. Do not let him stop. Strike him so

       (A24:13)
  (24) ""áz6t táwrux p5rmêtle.} ‘You should go and slaughter your ox.’
       (A7:2)It may also be used imperfectively to express general commands or pro-
hibitions that are not delimited to a single action, e.g.  (25) hàtxa ""oðéti b-náše!} ‘This is what you should do to people!’ (A22:47)
  (26) là-qabl6t} là b6‰-náša t-áw6r gáwa} ""u-là h7w6n.} ‘Don’t allow any person

  (27) là maßí°6t} ""àni} sa†anyà°5la} ‘Don’t listen (to such things), they are
       little demons.’ (A26:11)The distinction between the imperative form and the deontic qa†6l form,
therefore, is not primarily one of aspect, although this may have some
bearing on the choice between the two. The main factor is rather the
communicative profile of the command. In principle a speaker uses the
imperative when he wishes to give the command a high degree of salience.
The deontic qa†6l form is used when it has a lesser degree of salience.
Various features contribute to this salience. One feature is immediacy. All
other things being equal, an imperative expresses the will of the speaker
for an action to be performed closer to the present moment than the qa†6l
form. Consider, for example, the pair of constructions (28) and (29), both
of which are perfective in aspect. In (28) the speaker invites the addressee
742                           chapter fifteento come immediately and join him swimming. In (29) the request relates
to an action of coming at a point further in the future:  (28) ""ána hon-sxáya gàwa.} b8y6t t-á°y6t sàxy6t?} d6-háyyo sxà!} ‘I am swim-
       ming in it. Do you want to swim? Come and swim!’ (A25:61)
  (29) yóm6t †¬à°a,} ""á°6t k6slˆni.} ‘In three days time come to us.’ (A22:17)It is relevant to note that the particle of immediacy d6-/de-, which is
commonly used with imperatives but only sporadically with deontic qa†6l,
is likely to be related etymologically to the adverbial diya ‘now’. In some
NENA dialects it is used in progressive contructions that express actions
that are taking place at the present moment (e.g. C. Ankawa d6-k-šat6n ‘I
am drinking’).
   As we have seen in (11) and (12), the action commanded by an impera-
tive may extend indefinitely into the future. In (14) the action has no
definite starting point. The relevant feature in all these cases is that the
speaker commands the action to begin or end immediately.
   The use of the imperative to express the command of iterative actions
cannot be motivated by temporal immediacy. The salience of the command
arises from its high degree of force, which is greater than in corresponding
iterative deontic expressions with qa†6l forms such as (30):  (30) kút-yom pál†6t ""u-xàðr6t,} ""áß6rta ""á°6t bˆ°a.} ‘Every day go out and wan-
       der about and then in the evening come back home.’ (A14:62)Another feature that contributes to salience appears to be the positiveness
of the command. All other things being equal, there is a greater tendency
to use the deontic qa†6l form with a negative command than with a posi-
tive one, as reflected in (31) and (32), in which positive commands and
prohibitions with perfective aspect referring to immediate actions are
used side by side:  (31) mèra hàyyo,} hàyyo!} madam-t-íw6t ""àti,} hàyyo!} là-""az6t.} ‘Come, come.
       Since it is you, come, don’t go!’ (A24:36)
  (32) ""áti là pálx6t.} ""áti tù.} ""àna pálx6n.} ‘Don’t you work. You sit down. I
       shall work.’ (A21:23)Indeed, in some NENA dialects, such as C. Qaraqosh, negative com-
mands can only be expressed by negating the qa†6l form (cf. Khan 2002:
351). In C. Barwar, as in many other NENA dialects, negation has been
                           the syntax of verbs                           743extended to imperative forms, but the distribution of negated commands
is still less than that of positive commands on account of the inherently
lower degree of salience of a negated command. The fact that the particle
d6-/de-, which gives added salience to a command, is largely restricted
to positive commands may also be a reflection of this inherently lower
salience of negated commands.
   All the uses of the imperative described above can be reconciled with
the claim that the form is perfective. As already remarked, cases such as
(11), (12) and (14) can be regarded as having an ingressive or termina-
tive sense, which are features exhibited by other perfective forms. The
occurrence of the imperative in iterative expressions can be explained as
being the use of a perfective form appropriate to command an individual
occurrence of the iterated action to command, by implication, the iter-
ated action as a whole. It is relevant to note that in (13) the speaker uses
in an adjacent clause the compound infinitive construction to refer to an
iterative action (†la-mótu m5°óy6lla gár6t ""ùmra?} ‘Why do you bring them
on the roof of the church?’). As we have seen (§15.4.2.4.), the use of the
infinitive construction to express an iterative action is an extension of its
use to express a perfective narrative present. It can be said that the basic
perfectivity of the form, which gives the commanded action delimited
boundaries, results in its salience and it is this perfectivity that gives the
sense of greater force in the command. The deontic qa†6l form, on the
other hand, may express either perfective or imperfective aspect. We may
summarize the features contributing to the salience in imperative forms in
the scales below, in which the symbol > should be read as ‘more salient
than’. All other things being equal, a command with the features on the
lefthand side of the scales would be more likely to be expressed by an
imperative than those with the features on the righthand side:              Perfective         >         Imperfective
              Positive           >         Negative
              Immediate          >         Non-immediateThe imperative may be extended by a variety of suffixes (§8.6.5.). Infor-
mants feel that these add additional force to the command like the prefixed
particle d6-/de-. In the text corpus they are attested only with positive com-
mands, which is likely to be a reflection of the inherently lower salience of
the negative commands. Another factor that determines the distribution
of the imperative forms with added suffixes is their position within a sec-
tion of discourse. When there are two or more imperatives in a sequence,
744                            chapter fifteenforms with added suffixes tend to be placed at the end of the sequence.
The heavy morphological coding of the forms is used in such contexts to
mark a final boundary of a discourse unit. The sequence may consist of
two or more different imperatives in a closely knit unit as in (33–35) or
the repetition of the same imperative as in (36) and (37), e.g.  (33) dú‰u sógena k6s-babàxu.} ‘Return, go to your father.’ (A14:85)
  (34) xuš-plùx6n!} ‘Go and work!’ (A39:1)
  (35) qu-p7g6n kàde} ‘Get up and bake kade cakes.’ (A30:41)
  (36) sí-mur ta-pèll6n waz‰r} múrgena málka °èle.} ‘Go and say to the minister
       so-and-so, say the king has come back.’ (A4:33)
  (37) xùl!} dàn5la.} qìrra.} xùlena!} ‘Eat! It is time. It has got cold. Eat!’
       (B5:34)In a few cases the imperative is used in narrative as a substitute for a
perfective narrative verbal form. These are addressed to the person
performing the action and are typically used when there is a transition
between spatial locations that involves a verb of movement. The clause
containing the imperative may open with a 3rd person subject pronoun
as in (38) and (39):  (38) qímt5la zìlta,} mu°7°6lla qußárta dìya.} ""a-zórta muttá°6lla gu-d-7 qußárt6t
       šwàwe} ""u-nubàlt6lla.} hadìya,} ""áw qu-šqúlla qußàrta-w} sí be-šwàwux.}
       šláma-ll5xu šwàwe.} ‘She went and brought her cooking pot. She put
       the small one in the cooking pot of the neighbours and took it (to
       her husband). Now, he—get up and take the cooking pot and go
       to the house of your neighbour! “Greeings to you neighbours.” ’
       (A5:4)
  (39) qáy6m yawèlle ""álpa dáwe xène.} ""áw xá-reša m-táma qú-si l-bˆ°a.} ""áp

       get up and go home. Bring back also those two thousand pieces
       of gold and come back “Greetings my brother snake! Peace and
       blessings!” ’ (A1:19–20)Example (40) illustrates the use of an imperative for another type of nar-
rative strategy. The negated imperative of the verb to say lá-mur ‘Do not
say!’, which is presumably addressed to the hearer of the narrative, has
the function of drawing special attention to what follows.

       knocked into the one next to him.’ (A22:34)The imperatives of the verbs qym ‘to get up’ and ""tw ‘to sit down’ are often
combined with the resultative participle: qu-qíma! ‘Get up (ms.)!’, qu-qímta!
(fs.), tu-tíwa! ‘Sit down (ms.)!’, tu-tíwta! ‘Sit down (fs.)!’ In the plural, the
plural inflection is used only on the participle: qu-qíme! ‘Get up (pl.)!’; tu-
tíwe! ‘Sit down (pl.)’. In some cases in the plural the imperative element
qu- or tu- is dispensed with altogether and the plural participle is used
alone with imperative function, e.g.  (41) páqðu tìwe.} ‘Please, sit down.’ (A15:8)
  (42) mèra de-tìwe.} ‘She said “Sit down.” ’ (A21:28)

The independent basic copula is marked with regard to the nature of the
predicate and subject and also with regard to the communicative salience
of the proposition expressed by the clause.
  There are restrictions with regard to the type of predicate and subject
that occur in this construction. The predicate is identificatory or expresses
626                             chapter fifteena permanent property of the subject, which is typically an intrinsic defin-
ing property rather than an acquired property. It is not used when the
predicate denotes a contingent situation. The subject of the construction
is always high in topicality. There is no restriction, however, regarding the
referential status of the subject, in that it may have a specific referent or
denote a generic class. This is illustrated in the following examples,  (1)  ""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
  (2)  ""ána ""íw6n Yúw6l Yu˙ànna.} ‘I am Yuw6l Yu˙anna.’ (A1:1)
  (3)  ""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
  (4)  ""áwwa ""íle sulàqa.} ‘This is the (festival of) Ascension.’ (B6:7)
  (5)  b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
       Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
       (A26:55)
  (6) ""í°wal6n ßàwma,} yá'ni ""éða y-a°éwa m6n-ßàwma.} ßáwma ""íle xamšì yomá°a.}
       ‘We had a fast, that is the festival came after a fast. The fast is fifty

  (7) ""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}

       ""íle gawàye,} dúna ""íle qam-t9ra.} ‘Everybody has his own basement
       stable and a place prepared (for feeding), which we call a duna
       (feeding pen). . . . The basement stable is inside and the feeding
       pen is outside.’ (B5:110)
  (10) xàr°a} y-a°él5ni ""èða} ""éð6t be-yàlda.} ""éð6t be-yálda ""íle w7°6t Mšìxa.} ‘Then
       we have (another) festival, the festival of Christmas. The festival of
       Christmas is (in commemoration of) the birth of Christ.’ (B6:12)The high topicality of the subject item in (4)–(10) arises from the fact that
its referent has been referred to in the immediately preceding discourse,
where it is an item of central concern. In the case of full nominal sub-
jects, moreover, the nominal itself has typically been mentioned in the
preceding clause, as can be seen in the examples. Constructions such as
(1)–(3) with 1st person pronominal subjects, however, often occur at the
beginning of speech. One factor contributing to the high topicality of the
subject referent could be that the referent of the pronoun is present and
observable by the hearer in the speech situation. Another factor is that
                              the syntax of verbs                                 627such clauses are typically used at the beginning of a speech in which the
first person referent plays a prominent role in the subsequent clauses. We
may call this forward pointing topicality. This is the case, for example,
with the discourse following the clause adduced in (1) above, which is
reproduced below:  (11) ""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo,} . . . hon-""è°ya †láb6lla bràtux,} nablènna
       †la-bàbi.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl . . . I have come seeking the hand
       of your daughter, in order to take her to my father.’ (A29:63)A construction with an independent copula is marked with regard to
communicative salience. It is used in clauses expressing assertive, factive
propositions, which are high in communicative salience in that the speaker
is committed to their factuality, but it is not used to express non-factive
propositions such as interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is
being questioned. If the clause is interrogative, the enclitic copula on the
predicate is used. This is illustrated in (12), which contains assertive and
interrogative clauses:  (12) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu
       ""6štà-yomela?} yarx7xu ""6sri-w-""6óóà-yomele?} ‘A week for us is seven days
       and a month is thirty days. Is your week six weeks? Is your month
       twenty-nine days?’ (A17:13)The communicative salience of the construction gives the clause a degree
of independence from the preceding discourse. This is often exploited to
express some kind of reorientation in the discourse. When the subject is
a 3rd person pronoun or a nominal that has been mentioned in the pre-
ceding discourse, the construction is generally used to express some kind
of elaborative background on what precedes. It can be seen as a device
to mark a boundary or discontinuity in the flow of the discourse. This is
a common discourse usage of contructions with communicative salience.
Alternatively communicative salience of the construction is sometimes
exploited to give prominence to a statement deemed to be of particular
importance. This applies especially to clauses with a 1st or 2nd person
pronominal subject (1–3). These often occur at the beginning of a section
of discourse.
   When the subject of the independent copula is pronominal, in some
cases it is expressed only by the inflection of the copula and is not real-
ized by an independent pronoun, e.g.
628                            chapter fifteen  (13) ""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèyw6n.} ‘They put
       the yoghurt in a churn. What is a churn? It is an animal skin.’
       (B6:38)
  (14) x7la díya mòdile} t-mazvêrra?} ""íla mìya.} ‘What is its power, which turns
       it? It is water.’ (B6:53)
  (15) ba""ú°6t ninwàye} . . . l7le ""éða diyàna.} ""íle ""éða qàwmi.} ‘The Rogation of
       the Ninevites is not a religious festival. It is a national festival.’
       (B6:17)Occasionally the independent copula with its own stress is placed after
the predicate, e.g.  (16) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
  (17) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
  (18) ""áw har-xá-mdi ""ìle.} ‘It is something.’ (A14:25)15.3.1.3. Enclitic Copula Attached to the Subject
When the subject of the clause is high in topicality, the copula in some
instances does not stand independently with its own stress but rather is
cliticized to the subject, e.g.  (1)   ""áyy5la óìta.} ‘This is butter.’ (B6:41)
  (2)   ""u-""áyy5la kùlla.} ‘This is all (the story).’ (A4:24)
  (3)   ""áw-ile sí‰a bìya.} ‘It is tied to it.’ (B6:55)
  (4)   xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed!’ (A24:42)These constructions share with the independent copula construction the
feature of having subjects with topical prominence. In the examples cited
above, the referent of the subject has been referred to in the immediately
preceding discourse where it is of central concern. The clauses are, how-
ever, unmarked with regard to the nature of the predicate, in that they
may express either a contingent or a permanent property of the subject.
They are also unmarked with regard to the communicative salience and
assertiveness of the proposition of the clause as a whole. This is shown
by the fact that the construction is used in interrogative clauses containing
interrogative words that are in the subject position, e.g.  (5)   ""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Who is in the house?’
  (6)   ""7nile zaqàra?} ‘Who is a weaver?’
                                 the syntax of verbs                         629Such constructions, therefore, are close in function to clauses with the
copula cliticized to the predicate, which are likewise unmarked with regard
to the nature of the predicate and the communicative salience of the clause.
They differ only in the marked status of the subject referent, in that this
must be an item that is topically prominent. The placement of the copula
on the interrogative subject as in (5) and (6) can be interpreted as a reflec-
tion of the topical prominence of the interrogative word. It is not topically
prominent by virtue of being informationally given, but rather since it is
what the question primarily requests information about.5 Moreover it has
a feature analogous to what has been described above as forward pointing
topicality. This is because the referent of the interrogative constituent is
typically expected to be identified in the subsequent discourse.
   The notion of forward pointing topicality also explains the attachment
of the copula in (7) to the adverbial hád6x, which is linked as a correlative
to the following prepositional phrase:  (7) ""ítli ðá brat6t-màma} hád6x-ila š†rànta} max-d-àwwa yóma.} ‘I have a cousin.
      She is as beautiful as this sun (lit. She is thus beautiful, like this
      sun).’ (A7:17)15.3.2. The Deictic Copula
As is the case with the independent basic copula, the deictic copula exhibits
certain restrictions with regard to the nature of the predicate and subject
and also with regard to the communicative salience of the proposition
expressed by the clause. It is generally used when the predicate expresses
a contingent situation that is not necessarily a permanent property of the
subject. It may be used without any other clause constituents to draw atten-
tion to the location of a referent in the current speech situation, e.g.  (1) mère kˆla tóto?} mère hòla.} ‘He said “Where is grandma?” He said
      “There she is (as we speak).” ’ (A7:24)In many cases it is combined with a locative adverbial in the predicate.
Examples from the text corpus:  (2) yoná°a hóla reše-reše-dìye.} ‘Doves are over him.’ (A25:58)

      For the topicality of interrogative words see Steedman (2000: 659).
630                            chapter fifteen  (3)   hóla skínta mênne.} ‘A knife is with him (= he has a knife).’ (A30:21)
  (4)   ""u-hóla wajjúwe díya làxxa.} ‘and her personal effects are here.’
        (A21:9)
  (5)   baxtá°6n hóla yaqúre t6rwê°na.} ‘Our wives are both pregnant.’ (A25:2)
  (6)   xètna hóle zína l-gàre.} ‘The groom is standing on the roof.’ (B8:34)Examples (2)–(6) all express contingent situations that hold at the moment
of speaking, but are not presented as permanent. The subjects are of
various different types of informational value including newly introduced
referents (2)–(3), referents that are anchored by a pronominal suffix to the
a previously mentioned referent (4) or to the participants of the speech
situation (5) and a referent that is explicitly given in the preceding dis-
course (6).
   The construction with the deictic copula is occasionally used where the
predicate is intended to express a permanent property of the subject. In
such cases the subject is generally a referent that has been newly intro-
duced into the discourse, e.g.  (7)  xa-bráta hóla tàma.} ‘A girl is there.’ (A25:68)
  (8)  ""Ón-Nùne} hóla npílta gu-""á°‰6t Bàrw6r.} ""“n-Nune lies in the land of
       Barwar.’ (B4:1)
  (9) qìm5le,} šèmm6t má°a díye wéwa Barwòre.} ""ámte dìye} hóla gu-Sàrzar} ""u-xále
       dìye} hóle gu-Daštàne.} ‘The name of his village was Barwore. His
       aunt is in Sarzar and his uncle is in Daštane.’ (A23:1)
  (10) ""í°6n xà""a} hóle gu-Kàrkuk.} ‘There is a person, he is in Kirkuk.’
       (A16:1)
  (11) kúlla p6lxàna,} p6lxán6t b7°a hóle b-qðàli.} ‘All the work, the work of
       the house is my duty (literally: is on my neck).’ (A21:27)The deictic copula may be used to express a permanent property in a
clause that has a topical, informationally given, subject. In such cases the
speaker draws special attention to the proposition expressed by the clause
rather than to the referent of the subject, e.g.  (12) ""aw-""7ne díye npílt5la ""isêq°e} ""ám6r hà!} hóla gwìrta!} ‘His eye fell on his
       ring and he said “Ah, she is married!” ’ (A26:31)In (12) the deictic copula gives particular prominence to the proposition
that ‘she is married’ due to the fact that the speaker is surprised by the
discovery of this unexpected situation.
                           the syntax of verbs                           631   In principle the subject of a deictic copula has a specific referent and
does not denote a generic class. Examples are sometimes encountered that
appear to go against this principle, such as (6) above where the subject
xètna (‘the groom’) is referring generically to the groom in any wedding.
In such cases the speaker is no doubt presenting the subject as if it were
a specific case of the class concerned for the sake of vividness.
   Constructions with the deictic copula are marked with regard to com-
municative salience, as is the case with the independent basic copula.
It is used in clauses expressing assertive, factive propositions, which are
high in communicative salience in that the speaker is committed to their
factuality, but it is not used to express non-factive propositions such as
interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is being questioned. If the
clause is interrogative, the enclitic copula on the predicate is used.  (13) baxtá°6n hóla yaqùre.} ‘Our wives are pregnant.’
  (14) baxtá°6n yaqùrela?} ‘Are our wives pregnant?’If a question does not relate to the factuality of a proposition, the deictic
copula may be used, e.g.  (15) qa-mó brónux hóle gu-bˆ°a? ‘Why is your son in the house?’The deictic copula is also used in an assertion that is embedded in a
question, e.g.  (16) lá-m6r5xu ""áyya qußárta hóla b-""ùrxa?} ‘Did you not say that this cook-
       ing pot is on the way (to giving birth)?’ (A5:5)In general the deictic copula is a device for drawing the particular attention
of the hearer to something in the immediate speech situation. This may
be a property of the subject expressed in the predicate that is observable
in the immediate situation, but not necessarily a permanent property, or
a permanent property that is unexpected. Alternatively it may be a ref-
erent that is newly introduced into the discourse and, therefore, worthy
of particular attention. In some cases, both of these conditioning factors
may be operative. The ultimate decision as to whether a basic copula or
a deictic copula is used, however, depends on the degree of prominence
that the speaker wishes to give to the subject referent or the predication
in a particular discourse context. Consider, for example, (17):
632                            chapter fifteen  (17) xa-šaqòl5le} mkùl‘5le} ""u-xa-xèna} ða-""à†ma} hóla sàxi.} mère ""áyya ""à†ma}
       nablètla ""6lla-dìya.} ‘One is a shank, it is stripped (of its meat).
       Another, a thigh, is in good condition. He said (to the servant)
       “Take this thigh to her.” ’ (A30:30)Here both the ‘shank’ and the ‘thigh’ are newly introduced referents and
the predications concerning them both denote contingent situations that
exist at the time of speaking. The narrator, however, wishes to give greater
prominence in the discourse to the ‘thigh’ since this is the concern of the
following speech.
   The deictic copula may be used to draw attention to the situation as
a whole expressed by a clause when this marks the onset of a section of
discourse and provides the background for what follows. Consider the
wider context of (5) cited above:  (18) málka mère †la-d-o-xóne f>qìra,} mère xòni} baxtá°6n hóla yaqúre t6rwê°na.}
       ""6n-báxtux mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxti mu°éla bròna,} brátux qa-bròni.} ""6n-báxti
       mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxtux mu°éla bròna,} ""a-bráti qa-brònux.} ‘The king
       said to the poor brother, he said “My brother, our wives are both
       pregnant. If your wife gives birth to a girl and my wife gives birth
       to boy, your daughter (will be married) to my son. If my wife gives
       birth to a daughter and your wife gives birth to a son, my daughter
       (will be married) to your son.” ’ (A25:2–3)The predicate of the independent basic copula, on the other hand,
expresses that a certain property is a permanent feature of the subject
but does not specify whether this property is observable in the immediate
speech situation. Similarly the independent basic copula does not draw
attention to the subject of the clause, since it is already activated in the
consciousness of the hearer due to its high degree of topicality.
   It is likely that the basic copula originated as a presentative construction,
similar in function to the deictic copula that is in use today. This explains
the use of the L-suffixes in the 3rd person, which originally expressed the
object of the presentative. At some stage this old presentative would have
lost its presentative function and been cliticized to the predicate, in con-
formity with the syntactic position of verbal inflection. This would have
been accompanied by the emergence of a new presentative device in the
form of the deictic copula. The construction with the basic independent
copula placed before the predicate, e.g. brónux ""íle xàwri} ‘Your son is my
                            the syntax of verbs                             633friend’ is likely to reflect a transitional stage of this development which
has survived in the modern dialect. As remarked, this construction does
not have an attention-drawing function to the same degree as the deictic
copula, but it nevertheless has greater communicative salience than the
construction with the enclitic copula.
   The deictic copula may be used with past tense reference in the context
of clauses with past verb forms, e.g.  (19) xa-pà‰a,} wiðále gáne max-qêšta.} Fárxo ""u-S6ttíye hóla k6s-©ðàðe.} ‘One
       lamb made itself like a bow. Farxo and S6ttiye were together.’
       (A25:28–29)
  (20) qím5le ""ap-Fárxo šqíl6lle zòrna,} mxáya zòrna,} bejíye hóla xa-gòta} ""èrwa
       xa-gòta.} ‘Farxo also took up the pipe and played pipe music, the
       young lambs were one side and the sheep the other.’ (A25:31)
  (21) hóla ""i°á°a gu-lˆša,} lyáša kùbbe,} ""u-""ê°y5le} bába dìya} ""u-w9zìr.} ‘Her
       hands were in dough, while kneading the meat-balls, and her
       father and the vizier came.’ (A21:26)
  (22) múßly6lla dìw6n.} díw6n t-xále díye hóla dwìqta.} ‘He brought them down
       to the meeting room. The meeting room of his uncle was full.’
       (A23:14)The deictic copula may be combined with the expressions heš ‘still’, hal-
díya ‘until now’, and har ‘already, still’, which imply that the situation has
an end-point or starting-point and is not permanent, e.g.  (23) ""áy heš-hóla gu-gòma.} ‘She is still in the basement stable.’ (A18:22)
  (24) jullèk°a hóla hár qrúšta rèša.} ‘As for the bowl (of yoghurt)—here, its
       crust is still on it.’ (A30:24)
  (25) ""áp-""o-†¬a°a q6m-p5rmìle.} ""u-d6bbóre hár-hola qam-t8r6t bòya.} ‘They
       slaughtered also the third one. The hornets were still before the
       door of the hole.’ (A20:9)
  (26) hal-díya hóla gu-móx6n ""áyya ""áxni.} ‘Until now this is in our memory.’
       (B16:12)Occasionally the deictic copula is placed after the predicate, e.g.  (27) ""árye dìye} k6s-báxte dìye hóla.} ‘His lions are with his wife.’ (A18:19)
  (28) ""7ne p°ìxt5la,} bas-†lìya hóle.} ‘His eye is open, but he is asleep.’
       (A31:6)
634                            chapter fifteenThe deictic copula is sometimes used to present a nominal, denoting its
existence without ascribing any property to it in a predicate, e.g.  (29) hóla ""isèq°a dìya.} ‘Here is her ring.’ (A25:69)
  (30) hóla zeðàye.} ‘Here are the breads.’ (A30:24)
  (31) hó""la mìya.} ‘Here is some water.’ (A28:18)15.3.3. The Copula in Subordinate Clauses
The distinction between the various copula constructions described above
are neutralized in subordinate clauses that are introduced by the condi-
tional particle ""6n and the general subordinating particle D. The latter
has various functions, such as a relativizer and complementizer, and is
often combined with other particles. If a copula clause occurs in such
clauses, the enclitic copula is always used, rather than the independent
or deictic copula, and this is attached to the particle at the head of the
clause, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-íle mì°a,} g8r6g mˆ°6n.} ‘If he is dead, I must die.’ (A8:61)
  (2)   ""6n-ít xonˆni,} háyyo tu-""áxxa k6slˆni.} ‘If you are our brother, come
        and sit here with us.’ (A39:7)
  (3)   ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla} xo-d-áwwa
        jùlla.} ‘If he is my nephew, he will come and know what these are
        or are not under this cloth.’ (A25:49)
  (4)   si-prúmle ""áwwa yála zòra} t-íle gu-dudìya.} ‘Go and slaughter this baby
        boy who is in the cradle.’ (A15:8)
  (5)   xìl6lle ""o-""ixála t-íle kêsle.} ‘He ate the food that was in front of him.’
        (A23:5)
  (6)   xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa.} ‘Let’s look for a man who is a
        hard worker.’ (A21:3)
  (7)   ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
  (8)   l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
        (A17:2)15.3.4. Copula on Focused Elements
The distinction between the various types of copula is neutralized also
when the speaker wishes to place a particular focus on one argument of
the clause. In such circumstances only the enclitic copula is used, even
where in equivalent clauses without such argument focus the deictic or
                             the syntax of verbs                                635independent copula occurs. The enclitic copula is attached to the focused
element, whether this be the subject or a component of the predicate of
the clause. The focused element bears the nuclear stress and is typically
moved to the front of the clause if is not already situated there. This
type of construction is used when the speaker wishes to put a contrastive
focus on one argument. In what follows the focus is represented in the
translation with italics:  (1) A: bróni hóle gu-bˆ°a.} B: là,} bàbux-ile gu-b7°a,} lá brònux.} ‘A: “My son
      is in the house”. B: “No, your father is in the house, not your son.” ’
  (2) A: bróni hóle dmíxa gu-bˆ°a.} B: là,} gu-kˆrm5le dmíxa,} lá gu-bˆ°a.} ‘A:
      “My son is asleep in the house”. B: “No, he is asleep in the orchard,
      not in the house.” ’
  (3) A: ""áwwa ""íle xêtna.} B: là,} qrìw5le ""áwwa,} lá xêtna.} ‘A: “This is the
      groom”. B: “No, this is the best-man, not the groom.” ’
  (4) A: ""áwwa ""ile mtúrßa m6n-kèpa.} B: là,} m6n-qˆs5le mtúrßa,} lá m6n-kèpa.}
      ‘A: “This is made of stone”. B: “No, this is made of wood, not of
      stone.” ’Examples from the text corpus:  (5) ""áwwa lˆle kálba.} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He is not a dog. you are a dog’ (A11:2)
  (6) ""áni xšíwela dêbb5la táma.} ‘They thought the bear (not the bees) was
      there.’ (A10:7)The contrastive focus may be an informationally given referent, as in the
following:  (7) A: ""èdyo xzéli xón6t Dawíð ""u-bròn-màme. bròn-máme ""íle zaqàra.} B: là,} xònele
      zaqára,} lá bròn-màme.} ‘A: “Today I saw the brother of David and
      his cousin. His cousin is a weaver”. B: “No, his brother is a weaver,
      not his cousin.” ’This neutralization applies only to strong focus, as is the case with contras-
tive focus. It is not necessarily used with a simple new information focus,
as is seen in constructions such as the following:  (8) A: ""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} B: brònux hóle gu-b7°a.} ‘A: “Who is in the house?”
      B: “Your son is in the house” ’.
  (9) A: ""ˆnile? B: ""áw ""íle xòni} ‘A: “Who is he?” B: “He is my brother” ’.
636                              chapter fifteen15.3.5. Past Copula Placed after the Predicate
The past copula may be placed after or before the predicate. Constructions
with the copula after the predicate are unmarked with regard to the nature
of the subject and predicate and also with regard to the communicative
salience of the proposition expressed by the clause. The predicate may
express a permanent situation in the past (1–6) or one that is contingent
to a particular moment or space of time and exists only temporally (7–9).
The subject may have a specific referent or denote a generic class. In most
cases the copula is cliticized to the predicate:  (1)   yèmme díye yêmmi-wawa} . . . bábe díye bàbiwa.} ‘His mother was my
        mother . . . His father was my father.’ (A32:31)
  (2)   ""Ëšwu† rába krèt-iwa gu-""à°‰a.} ‘February was very bad in our country.’
        (B5:152)
  (3)   ma‰ú°a mturáßt5wa m-qˆsa.} ‘The snow shovel was made of wood.’
        (B5:196)
  (4)   ""ína báte qám°a †ìna-w5wa.} ‘Formerly, however, houses were made
        of mud.’ (B5:198)
  (5)   fa-xayu°éy b-dawˆr5wa.} ‘Their livelihood was in the mule.’ (B5:126)
  (6)   xóne díye f>qìra-wewa.} ‘His brother was poor.’ (A25:1)
  (7)   gu-bˆ°a wéwa,} har-zála-w °àya.} ‘He was in the house, walking back
        and forth.’ (A6:1)
  (8)   b-yárx6t šàww5wa,} . . . xošèb5wa.} . . . koðènta b-ìði-yawa} šulxˆ°a.} . . . ""ána
        šobàn6nwa xá‘‘a.} ‘It was in the month of July . . . it was a Sun-
        day . . . The mule was in my hand . . . I was suffering from a bit of
        a cold.’ (B5:130)
  (9)   w-áw xamìm5wa,} pšìra,} ßèlya gu-tàlga.} ‘It was warm, (the snow) melted
        and it dropped down into the snow.’ (B5:154)The unmarkedness of the construction with regard to the communica-
tive salience of the proposition it expresses is shown by the fact that it is
used both in assertive, factive clauses and also in non-factive, interrogative
clauses, e.g.  (10) xónux gu-bˆ°5wa.} ‘Your brother was in the house.’
  (11) xónux gu-bˆ°5wa?} ‘Was your brother in the house?’On some occasions the copula bears its own stress, e.g.
                             the syntax of verbs                              637  (12) ""áni milàne ""iy7wa.} ‘They were green.’ (B5:218)
  (13) xá gáw‰a x5lána-w zàxma wéwa.} ‘He was a powerful, tough man.’
       (A27:1)
  (14) sab-qyámta b-lˆle ""iyáwa.} ‘because Easter was at night.’ (B5:53)15.3.6. Past Copula Placed before the Predicate
Constructions with the copula placed before the predicate are likewise
unmarked with regard to the nature of the predicate, in that it may
express a permanent (1–7) or contingent (8–9) situation. There is no past
form of the deictic copula and the construction Subject—""iwa—Predicate,
therefore, corresponds to both that of the independent present copula
(Subject—""ile—Predicate) and that of the deicitc copula (Subject—hole—
Predicate).  (1)   m6lxáwa ""íwa mtúrßa m-qˆsa.} ‘The winnowing fork was made from
        wood.’ (B5:87)
  (2)   w-áw ""iwéwa malàxa.} ""áw y>ðéwala ""áyya tuní°6t B6lbèl Hazàr.} ‘He was
        an angel. He knew the story of B6lb6l Hazar.’ (A8:25)
  (3)   gá""at tèrte xzéle málka dúnye ráya dèwe.} xèlm6t málka ""íwa ""úp-""aw zàwna.}
        ‘The second time the king saw (in his dream) that it was raining
        wolves. Also that dream of the king was (like) the time.’ (A1:24)
  (4)   ""u-""áy ""iyéwa qèßß6t yá'ni rêzza.} ‘That was the story of rice’ (B5:87)
  (5)   dawˆra} ""íwa xa-mèndi ""ax-t-ámr6x ""íðe-w ""àqle y-amrèxla} ‘The mule was
        something that was (as important to somebody as) “his hands and
        his legs,” as we say.’ (B5:124)
  (6)   Nìnwe} ""iwáwa pét6xt ""a°oràye.} ‘Nineveh was the capital of the Assyr-
        ians.’ (B6:17)
  (7)   ""í°wa xa-Xáno Lapzèrin.} b-""8ß6l díye ""iwéwa q>r>‘àya.} ‘There was a cer-
        tain Xano the Golden Hand. In origin he was a gypsy.’ (A11:1)
  (8)   hadíya mšár6x q6ßßètt6t M8mo-w Zìne.} M9mo} ""íwewa gu-""Al?n} ""u-Zíne
        ""iwáwa gu-Jazíre Bòta.} ‘Now we shall begin the story of M>mo and
        Zine. M>mo was in ""Alàn and Zine was in Jazire Bota.’ (A26:1)
  (9)   m-bar-hàd6x} q5mìwa} mzabóne ""ilàna.} náše ""íwa kòpa.} ‘After that they
        would sell the tree. The people were below.’ (B5:42)When the clause expresses a permanent situation, the subject typically has
topical prominence, as is the case in Subject—""ile—Predicate construc-
tions. In the examples occurring in the text corpus, the topical prominence
generally results from the fact that the referent has been evoked in the
638                           chapter fifteenimmediately preceding context. Note that in (5), however, the referent has
not been previously activated, but it plays a central role in the following
context.
   When the copula is placed before the predicate, the clause has some
kind of communicative salience. This is reflected by the fact that it is
restricted to assertive, factive clauses and is not used in non-factive, inter-
rogative clauses. The communicative salience in the examples occurring
in the text corpus can in most cases be shown to have a discourse func-
tion. The clauses generally mark some kind of semantic boundary in
the discourse. In (1) and (2) the copula clauses constitute an explanatory
elaboration concerning a referent that has been evoked in the preceding
context that breaks the flow of the discourse. Also in (3) the construc-
tion is used in a clause that is explanatory of what precedes. The clause
in (4) is a summarizing remark, which marks the end of a section. The
constructions in (5)–(7) occur at the beginning of a section of discourse
that supply important preliminary material. The same applies also to (8),
where the construction is used to express a contingent situation. In (9) the
copula clause denotes a contingent situation that is circumstantial to the
event referred to in the previous clause and does not carry the narrative
line forward.
   In (10) the past copula is used in a different type of function, namely
to introduce a time adverbial at an episodic boundary of discourse. The
copula here gives morpological weight to the initial adverbial expression
and is not translatable directly into idiomatic English:  (10) ""íwa sá""6t tmánya qédamta xzéli xákma náše °àya} m6n-""æn-Nune ta-Dùre.}
       ‘At eight o’clock in the morning I saw some people coming from
       ""“n-Nune to Dure.’ (B1:11)15.3.7. The Negative Copula
The present and past negative copula forms refer to states, both per-
manent (1–3) and contingent (4–6), in the present and past respectively.
They correspond, therefore, to both the basic and deictic forms of the
positive copula:  (1)   ""áwwa lˆle kálba.} ‘He is not a dog.’ (A11:20)
  (2)   l7w6t d-áwwa ""à°‰a.} ‘You are not from this land.’ (A25:82)
  (3)   xu-l7wa †axxána bròn-taxxanˆ°a?} ‘Was he not a miller the son of a
        miller-woman?’ (A32:28)
                              the syntax of verbs                                 639  (4)   dárdi l7la d-àyya.} ‘My suffering is not from this.’ (A26:66)
  (5)   lˆwa yóm6t šáb°a.} ‘It was not Saturday.’ (A14:58)
  (6)   ""ína l7wa mèdre gnàyux.} ‘But it was not your fault again.’ (A1:25)15.3.8. The Existential Particles
The existential particle ""i°, together with its variant forms (§8.20.1.),
expresses either a permanent (1–3) or a contingent (4–6) situation:  (1)   ""í°6n xa-†ùra.} ‘There is a mountain.’ (A24:11)
  (2)   ""í°6n biš-gù‰e mènni.} ‘There are better men than me.’ (A26:79)
  (3)   ""ítli ðá brat6t-màma.} ‘I have a cousin.’ (A7:17)
  (4)   ""í°6n tàma} †è¬¬6° bná°a xène.} ‘There are there three other girls.’
        (A26:24)
  (5)   ""ána ""í° šùla qámi.} ‘There is work in front of me (to do).’ (A24:45)
  (6)   ""ítli xákma xabráne t-amrênn6x.} ‘I have a few words to say to you.’
        (A4:40)The existential particle is sometimes combined with the deictic copula,
e.g.  (7)  hóla ""í°6n jênne gáwa!} ‘There are jinn in it!’ (A22:33)
  (8)  hóle ""í°6n xà} k6s-tòto} sàwta.} ‘There is somebody at the home of the
       old woman.’ (A24:44)
  (9) qam-""árya hóle ""ì°6n} gêlla.} ""u-qam-""èzza hóle ""ì°6n} bêsra.} šqúl bêsra} m-qam-
       ""êzza} dríle qam-""àrya.} ""u-gêlla} šqúlle m-k6s-""àrya} drìle} qa-""êzza.} ‘Before
       the lion there is grass and before the she-goat there is meat. Take
       the meat from before the goat and put it before the lion. Take the
       grass from the lion and offer it to the she-goat.’ (A24:15)
  (10) qàwra} ""í°6n xa-káwe gàwa} ""u-hóle ""í°6n jawêtta,} jawètt6t práma qˆse.} ""i-
       q7ma xa-dalí°6t xùwwe} ""i-x8ða l-án tre-xoriyà°a.} kút ""ás6q qamáya xazéla
       ""5-dalí°a brì°6ll-ani} parêmla.} ‘There is a hole in the grave. There is a
       chopper, a chopper to cut wood. A wild vine grows up and winds
       around those two willow trees. The first to see the vine growing
       on those (trees) cuts it down.’ (A26:91)
  (11) hóle ""í°6n bóya zòra.} ‘There is a small hole.’ (A20:5)
  (12) hóle ""í°6n làxxa} stêrra.} ‘There is here a storeroom.’ (A23:17)These examples express both contingent (7–9) and permanent (10–12)
situations. The crucial conditioning factor for the use of the deictic copula
640                           chapter fifteenis not the nature of the situation expressed by the predicate, but rather
the discourse prominence that the speaker wishes to give to the referent
introduced by the clause. In (7) the force of the deictic copula is to express
the unexpectedness of the existence of jinn. In the remaining examples
the referent introduced plays a prominent role in the ensuing discourse.
In (8) the man at the home of the old woman is the protagonist of the
following narrative. In (9) the grass and the meat are in the centre of
attention in what follows. In (10) the deictic copula is used with the clause
introducing the ‘chopper’ but not in the one introducing the ‘hole’ in the
grave. It is the activity associated with the chopper that is the concern of
the following discourse, as shown in the cited example, whereas the ‘hole’
is only an incidental referent. In (11) and (12) the referent introduced acts
as the spatial setting for the following section of discourse.
    The past existential particle (""i°wa) and the negative existential particle
(li°, li°wa) are, likewise, used to express a permanent (13–15) or contingent
(16–18) situation. They are not, however, combined with the deictic copula:  (13) ""í°wa xa-màlka.} ‘There was a king.’ (A1:2)
  (14) lì°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} ‘There are not steps for them to go
       down into the basement stable.’ (A22:10)
  (15) ""7-ga lí°wa bêrqa.} ‘At that time there was not electricity.’ (B10:45)
  (16) ""í°wa bráta dmíxta kèsle dìye.} ‘There was a girl sleeping with him.’
       (A26:6)
  (17) lí° ""áp-xa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Is there nobody in the house?’ (A22:32)
  (18) lì°wale qußàrta.} ‘He did not have a cooking-pot.’ (A5:1)The noun that is introduced by an existential particle may refer to a
specific item, as in the majority of the examples above, or to a class (18).
Further examples of constructions with class nouns:  (19) ""í°6n bê†ma.} ‘There is the terebinth tree.’ (B5:220)
  (20b) ""í°wa ""9raq.} ‘There was arak.’ (B5:11)
  (21) ""í°wa lèxma y-amrèxwa zeðàye.} ‘There was bread that we called
        zeðaye.’ (B5:15)
  (22) ""í°wa xyápt6t xêtna.} ‘There was the washing of the groom.’
        (B5:25)There is no clear functional distinction between the short and long vari-
ants of the existential particles. They appear to be in free variation. In
                             the syntax of verbs                                641a series of two parallel clauses containing the particles, however, a short
variant is often followed by a long variant, giving the final clause of the
pair end-weighting, e.g.  (23) xùy5le,} púrya lì°,} b6rqa lì°6n.} ‘It is dark. There is no light and there
       is no electricity.’ (A23:29)
  (24) ‘ù-qala lí°.} ‘ú-qala lí°6n m6nnèy.} ‘There is no sound. There is no
       sound of them.’ (A18:15)On many occasions the present existential particles (""i°, li°) occur in the
context of past form verbs and have past tense reference, sharing their
deictic centre with these verbs.  (25) qímela xìlela.} qímela šqílela xa-""amána xàn‘i zóra.} mútt6lla k6s-réša dìya.}
       ßáw°a lì°6n.} ‘They ate. Then they took a small container and put
       it at her head. There was no speech (with this).’ (A21:17–18)
  (26) mútt6lla gu-""a†nàb6l} ""u-nùbl6lla.} ""áw ""ítle ða-""ót6x ""ax-d-àyya,} zùrt5la,}
       qaráw6t d-àwwa} ""u-t-yèmme díye,} ""u-""al-""9ra} lí° ‘ù-m6ndi,} lá kursìya}
       ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘They put her in a car and took her off. He had
       one room like this one, it was small, his bed and his mother’s, on
       the floor there was nothing, no chair, nothing.’ (A21:5)15.3.9. The Verb hwy
In addition to the various copulas and the existential particles, the verb
‘to be’ may be expressed by the verb hwy, which is inflected in all verbal
bases. Many of the inflections of this verb supply functions that are not
expressed by the copulas or existential particles, though in some cases
there is functional overlap.15.3.9.1. qa†6l15.3.9.1.1. Realis
The qa†6l form of hwy, without any prefixed particle, is occasionally used in
a realis sense, referring imperfectively to a situation in the present, e.g.  (1)   ""u-zeðàya} ""íla biš-xlìmta.} xlìmta hóya.} ‘A zeðaya bread is thicker. It is
        thick.’ (B6:49)
  (2)   ""u-xàkma dukáne} xà-yoma háwe ""éða.} ‘In some places the festival is for
        one day.’ (B6:2)
642                           chapter fifteen  (3) hal-""aßèrta ""áw háwe šulˆni.} ‘This is our activity until the evening’
      (B6:11)
  (4) yóm6t ""èsri-w xámša háwe ""èða.} ‘The twenty-fifth day is the festival’
      (B6:13)
  (5) ""ína ""áyy6t xúmßa har-xúmßa háwe xwarnàya.} ‘But the dish consisting
      only of xumßa is whitish.’ (B10:16)
  (6) ""ˆ-ga} Rustám ""o-mtán5 mènne y-ámri ""7-g6 damêxwa,} †¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°à
      l5l>wá°a háwe dmìxa.} ‘Now, they say of Rustam that when he slept,
      he would be asleep for three days and three nights.’ (A29:2)
  (7) har-dmáxta dìy6n} biz-zóda gu-b5°wà°a hóya.} ‘Our sleeping is mostly
      in the houses.’ (B15:27)
  (8) qedámta hál bar-kawù°ra} šèmša y-óya bà°6r †úra,} fa-†êlla háwe} qam-†ùra.}
      ‘In the morning, until after lunch, the sun is behind the mountain
      and there is shade at the front of the mountain.’ (B3:2)These examples exhibit differences regarding the referential status of the
subject and the nature of the predicate. They may be divided into three
categories.  (i) In (1)–(5) the subject has generic reference and the predicate denotes
        a permanent situation.
  (ii) In (6) the subject has a specific referent and the predicate refers to
        a habitual, iterative situation.
  (iii) In (7)–(8) the subject has generic reference and the predicate refers
        to a habitual, iterative situation.","[664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681]"

       (A20:6)Further examples from non-narrative discourse in the text corpus are
presented in (43)–(48), in most of which the copula is negative or is a
clitic attached to a subordinating particle. Note that in (45)–(47) the con-
struction is used in combination with the qa†6lwa form and in (48) with
the resultative form.  (43) ""6n-la-ß5mèxla m9r6x.} ""áxni gò‰e,} bas-""ánna bnóne zòre} hadíya lˆla ßyám6lla

       ‘Today, everything that I hear here, my mother has told me and
       I know it.’ (B8:15)On some occasions the deictic copula is used with the infinitive when it
has an iterative usage. As with the narrative usage, the motivation for the
deictic copula is generally to direct particular attention to a clause that
occurs at some kind of boundary in the discourse. In (49)–(51) the deictic
copula occurs at the onset of a segment of discourse. Example (49) is the
opening of a section of direct speech and (50) coincides with a shift in
subject referent and also a temporal shift marked by the adverb ‘now’. In
(51) the deictic copula occurs at the onset of a chain of clauses in which
there is a shift in subject referent. The situation described in this chain

an additional motivation for drawing attention to it by the deictic copula.
In (52) the deictic copula gives weight to the closing clause in a section
describing the iterative situation in which a certain character in the nar-
rative sings. The infinitive here has the b- preposition, the motivation for
which here may also be to give the clause additional morphological end
weighting.  (49) kúlla náša hóle zála l-šùla.} ""àp-""ana bt-áz6n šúla} pàlx6n.} ‘Everybody

       ‘When he sings, nightingales gather at his voice and the leaves of
       the wood fall.’ (A25:46)15.4.2.5. Performative Function
The infinitive construction is used in some performative verbs, which
perform an action by their utterance rather than make a truth-evaluable
description of a situation. In this function the construction has a perfective
aspect, as in the narrative present and iterative functions. Characteristi-
cally of its perfective use elsewhere, there is a greater tendency to use the
enclitic copula than when it expresses progressive aspect. Performative
usage is attested in the verb mqawole ‘to promise’, e.g.  (1)   mqawòl5w6n,} ""ap-""an-zúze kúlla t-in šqìl6lla} p>lènna pàlge.} ‘I promise,
        I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)The expression ‘I say to you’ in contexts such (2)–(4) also has a perfor-
mative function, which no doubt explains why it is used with an enclitic
copula:  (2)   már6nnux plú† m-àxxa.} ‘I say to you: Leave here!’ (A12:5)
  (3)   màr6nnux} ""áti grùš gánux.} ‘I say to you: Go away!’ (A12:10)
718                                chapter fifteen   (4) w-áti mò t-amrètli?} mère ""ána mar6n-êllux} hé d°s,} ""í°walux ""o-kàrma.}
       ‘ “What will you say to me?” He said “I say to you: Yes, it’s true,
       you had that orchard.” ’ (A17:33–34)15.4.2.6. Movement of the Enclitic Copula
The positive clitic copula of the construction may be moved to a con-
stituent that occurs before or after the infinitive in the same types of
environment that condition the movement of the copula in the resulta-
tive construction described in §15.4.1.4. This can be seen in several of
the examples cited already above. Further examples classified into their
various functional types are:15.4.2.6.1. Leftward Movement of the Enclitic(i) Narrow Information Focus   (1) ""àtit wáða ""ixála?} ‘Are you making food (not somebody else)?’
       (A21:27)

       God, I am coming from home.’ (A23:2)
   (5) ""ána míya m-""ˆw6n štáya.} ‘I drink water (even) from the clouds.’
       (A26:34)

  (3) ""u-béna ""íman t-ila-pyáša gò‰e} xá‘‘a šúla biš-zàm6t-ile.} ‘When they become
      big, the work is a little more difficult.’ (B5:105)15.4.2.6.2. Rightward Movement of the Enclitic
This is found only where the construction is used with a perfective aspect,
either to express a narrative present or an iterative event, i.e. where it is
common to have an enclitic rather than a deictic copula. As in the resulta-
tive construction, the purpose of the rightward movement onto the final
item of the predicate is to give prominence, but not narrow information
focus, either to the item to which it is attached or to the clause as a whole.
In the examples attested in the text corpus, the construction is used to give
added prominence to the clause in order to signal some kind of boundary
in the discourse, marking off the clause from what precedes or follows.
In (1) the clause describing the tying of the bands marks the closure of
the chain of events in the marriage ceremony. In (2) the construction
occurs at the beginning of a segment of discourse that presents elabora-
tive information on what precedes. In (3) the construction separates the
second clause distinctly from the first to express a contrastive opposition
between the action of Barz6kko and that of his companions.  (1) bár t-ila-báxta pyáša rásmi tàma} yá'ni wára gu-l-bˆ°a,} °áy5le qàša} ""u-sá‰a
      gnùn5le.} ‘After the woman becomes official there, that is she enters
      the house, the priest comes and ties the band.’ (B5:44)
  (2) ""u-béna ""íman t-ila-pyáša gò‰e} xá‘‘a šúla biš-zàm6t-ile.} l6""ánnahu pyáša

      become big, the work is a little more difficult. This is because, when
720                           chapter fifteen      they become big, the job to maintain them is bigger, and you must
      be very careful.’ (B5:105)
  (3) ""ánna kúlla dmàx5la.} Barzèkko pyáša ˙àr6s-ile.} ‘They all went to sleep.
      Barz6kko became the guard.’ (A12:9)15.4.2.7. Infinitive Combined with the Past Copula
The infinitive may be combined with the past copula (for the morphology
of this compound form see §8.19.4.5.). This expresses the past progressive.
It is typically used in narrative to denote an action or situation that was
in progress in the past and overlapped temporally with the occurrence
of a punctual event, e.g.  (1) zàl5wa,} xá-bena xzéle m-rè˙qa xá-mdi xwàra.} ‘As he was going along,
      he suddenly saw from afar something white.’ (A14:28)
  (2) xà-yoma} dèbba xðára-wawa gu-†uràne.} tfíqla b-xa-tèla.} ‘One day a bear
      was wandering around the mountains. She met a fox.’ (A20:1)
  (3) xðár6nwa l-ày-goti,} ""áqli tíwla š-""áql6t bàxta.} ‘I was turning over to
      my (other) side and my leg settled on the leg of the woman.’
      (A16:11)
  (4) mèr6x ""èlla mtanìla} ""u-xa-mašmóye-wewa ""6llˆni láz6m.} ‘You said “You must
      tell it” and somebody must have been listening to us.’ (A35:19)
  (5) m>‰òy6nwala,} gu-ðà-"">ra.} . . . q6m-maxyále púmma díya l-rêzza} ‘I was
      grazing it in a certain piece of land. . . . It put its mouth in the rice.’
      (B5:131)Note the preposing of the copula before the infinitive when the construc-
tion is combined with the particle har ‘still’ in (6). This can be compared
to the leftward movement of the copula onto initial adverbials in other
types of compound verbal constructions (e.g. yóma hádele zrìqa} ‘The sun
has just now risen’ §15.4.1.4.1. example 30):  (6) píšle yòma} hár-wewa xðàra,} xzéle xa-b6ßlíßa zòra.} ‘Day came and he was
      still searching about, when he saw a small ray of light.’ (A14:24)If two or more infinitives are concatenated, the copula may be omitted
after its use on the first one of the series, e.g.  (7) zílla xákma šênne,} málka hár xzàya-wewa,} b-xzáya mbaqóre l-d-ò-naša.}
      ‘Several years went by (during which) the king was investigating and
      inquiring concerning the man.’ (A8:5)
                              the syntax of verbs                                721  (8)   xéna ""ánna kúlley,} lá baxtá°a pyáša-w5wa yaqùre,} lá bnòne} ""èzze ma°òye,} lá
        ""arxà°a.} ‘But all of these—the women were not becomng pregnant,
        the goats were not producing young, the mills were not (produc-
        ing).’ (A38:1)The temporal overlap function of the form is used in (9) to present an
explanation of a previous statement of a character in the narrative:  (9)   màr5wa} har-""àww5le} ""6n-""ítle nawàge.} ‘He was saying (he meant by
        this) “Is he just him (alone) or does he have grandchildren?” ’
        (A17:16)The construction is used in non-narrative discourse to express the temporal
overlap of an action with iterative events in the past. In the cases where
this is attested in the text corpus the copula is placed before the infinitive.
In §15.3.6. it has been shown that clauses in which the past copula is
placed before the predicate express in principle some kind of communi-
cative salience. This is likely to be the case here, since in both examples
two clauses with the infinitive construction are set up in opposition. The
preposing of the copula is used to mark off the two clauses distinctly from
one another. Another factor for the preposing of the copula in the phrase
har-iwa-práma of (10) may be the particle har, as is the case in (6) above:  (10) ""áy mòdi q†á""a †árpa?} q>†ìwale,} xá har-iwa-práma zdáya l-9ra-w} ""an-xéne
       ""iyáwa bá°re bá°re wáða †àxe} ‘What is the cutting down of leaves?
       They cut them down, one person cutting and throwing them on
       the ground, while others were behind him making small piles.’
       (B5:118)
  (11) m-bar-hàd6x} q5mìwa} mzabóne ""ilàna.} náše ""íwa kòpa} kùlla,} ""u-""áwwa
       gárewa ràma.} ""áwwa náše ""iy7wa kúlla spára kòpa.} ""a-""ilána mzabnìwala
       y-amrèxxa.} ‘After that they would sell the tree. The people were all
       below and he (the groom) was high up on the roof, all the people
       were waiting below. They sold the tree, as we say.’ (B5:42)Note also (12), in which the temporal overlap function with an ongoing
situation is used to express a concessive sense. The ongoing negated situ-
ation can be considered to be iterative (‘on no occasion have they asked
for you’):  (12) hadíya xon>wà°ux,} már6twa xon>wà°i,} ""áyya xá-šeta hóla támma láxxa
       l7la mbaqorêllux.} ‘Now your brothers—(although) you called (them)
722                             chapter fifteen        “my brothers”, it has been a year that they have been here but
        have not (even once) asked for you.’ (A26:78)As is the case with the present copula, the motivation for the preposing
of the past copula is sometimes to cliticize it to constituents of the clause
that stand before the infinitive. In (13) and (14), for example, it is cliticized
to the subordinating particle D:  (13) ""án-zuz6t ""a°íwa m6n-mzabánt6t ""ilàna} ""íwa hayàrta} qa-k yálo-w xêtna} t-íwa
       gwàra.} ‘The money that was received from the sale of the house
       was assistance for the bride and groom who were getting married.’
       (B15:67)
  (14) madàm t-iwètwa pláxa ""átxa m6ndiyáne} t-amrènnux mò-""oð6t?} ‘Since
       you have been doing such things, should I tell you what to do?’
       (A14:79)15.4.2.8. Infinitive Combined with the Verb hwy
The copula in the infinitive construction may be replaced by various
inflections of the verb hwy in certain contexts. The following forms are
attested in the text corpus.15.4.2.8.1. hawe q†ala
This form is found in the protasis of conditional constructions referring
to a progressive action that overlaps temporally with that of the apodosis,
e.g.  (1)   ""6n-háwe plá†a m6n-""èrxe †íša qàmxa,} lá h>mèn6t ""êlle.} ‘If he is coming
        out of the water-mill covered in flour, do not trust him.’ (D2:61)15.4.2.8.2. y-awe q†ala
This is found in (1), where it expresses a habitual progressive, denoting an
activity that was habitually in progress and overlapping temporally with
another activity or situation. The construction here has past time refer-
ence by taking the past reference of the verbs in the preceding context
as its deictic centre:  (1)   sab-xa-xa-gáye ""i-maxéwa tmanyà sa""êtte} bar-©ðáðe t-là-kl5°a.} tmanyá sa""ètte
        y-áwa mxàya} ""u-náše dwìqe.} ‘For, sometimes, they played for eight
        hours continuously without stopping. They would be playing for
        eight hours while the people held (each other).’ (B15:77)
                             the syntax of verbs                                72315.4.2.8.3. y-awewa q†ala
This form expresses a habitual progressive in the past. In (1)–(3) it is used
to denote an activity that habitually overlapped with another activity or
situation:  (1) ßalènwa y-awéwa rxà°a.} ‘I would go down while it was fermenting.’
      (B5:212)
  (2) ""í°wa †awalyá°a rábe ràbe} m†alìwa.} ""ò yóma} kúlle yòma} y-awáwa m†awòle}
      ""u-náš6t má°a kùlla} síqe mparóje biyèy.} ‘There were many games that
      they played. They would be playing all that day and (while they
      were doing so) all the people of the village would go up to look at
      them.’ (B7:4)
  (3) béna bálki ""o-nàša,} ""o-xêtna t-ámr6x,} ""o-""ùrza,} lˆwe táma.} y-awéwa pláxa
      gu-mðinà°a m8°>lan.} ‘Perhaps the person, that is the groom, the
      man, was not there. He was working (at that time) in the towns,
      for example.’ (B5:18)In (4) and (5) it is used to express a habitual activity that was temporally
delimited. The end of this activity is mentioned in the context. In (4) the
people in question ceased to worship God when they had a son. In (5)
the habitual bad behaviour of the child at school was short-lived since
we are told in the following context that he was expelled:  (4) hál xámši-w xámša šênne} y-aw7wa sxáða ""alàha,} y-ám6r ya-""alàha,} yawètl6n
      xa-bròna.} ""ím6t ""aláha yíwle ""6lléy bròna} šuréla manšóy6lle ""alàha,} là txára
      ""álaha,} ""u-là-mßal5wa qa-""álaha.} ‘For fifty-five years they were wor-
      shipping God, he (the man) would say “Oh God, give us a son.”
      When God gave them a son, they began to forget God, they did
      not remember God and did not pray to God.’ (A15:17)
  (5) qímla mšodèrra bròn-díya m6dràsa.} bróna díya gu-m6drása kút-yum y-awéwa
      mxáya l-aw-yàla,} šqála ‘ánta d-àwwa,} šrà†a m6ndiyáne.} ‘She sent her
      son to school. Her son everyday in school would beat one child,
      take the bag of another, tear things.’ (A14:5)15.4.2.8.4. t-awe q†ala
This construction is formed by combining the future b6d-qa†6l form of hwy
with the infinitive. In most cases it expresses a future progressive. It may
be used to denote an activity that will be in progress when a perfective
future action takes place, e.g.
724                              chapter fifteen  (1) ""íman má†6n têmm6l,} ""áw t-áwe pláxa gu-bˆ°a.} ‘When I arrive tomorrow,
      he will be working in the house.’
  (2) qa-d-áwwa ""áw6ð xa-‘ˆra,} ""6n-t-áwe ràqa,} qa-t-""áw6ð xa-‘ˆra qa-gáne.} ‘so
      that he could find a solution, so that, if he had to flee, he could
      find for himself a solution.’ (A18:17)It may denote a perfective future action that has a quantifiable duration.
This differs from the b6d-qa†6l form, which is unmarked with regard to the
durability of the action, e.g.  (3) tre-†¬á yománe xéne bt-áw6t ma†róye xàß-sùsa.} ‘You shall ride on horse
      back two or three more days.’ (A8:46)The t-awe q†ala form may also be used to express a temporally delimited
habitual activity in the future. In (4) the existence of an endpoint is implied
by the question ‘until when?’ In (5) the sense is that the horse will be
screeching during each interval of time in which the salt strikes his legs:  (4) hal-""ìman t-áw6t hátxa mdagóle?} ‘For how long will you be telling lies?’
      (A26:56)
  (5) mèlxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye,} t-áwe súsa mßarßòre.} ‘Salt will strike his legs
      and the horse will screech.’ (A24:12)In (6) it is used as a modal progressive, expressing deontic possibility in
a question, which is one of the functions of the b6d-qa†6l form (§15.1.5.2.
examples 16–18):  (6) ""ˆka t-áwe mašmóye?} ‘Where could he be listening?’ (A35:20)In (7) the form is used to express an iterative activity in the past that is
temporally limited, which, as we have seen (§15.4.2.7.3.), is expressed
elsewhere with the y-awewa q†ala form. The purpose of using the t-awe
form of hwy is to express sequentiality to what precedes, which is one of
the functions of the b6d-qa†6l form (§15.1.5.4.):  (7) wírra š6kwánta qam7°a šqilála ða-˙ábba ""u-plì†la.} wírra t-tèrte šqilála
      ða-˙ábba-w plì†la.} wírra t-†è¬¬6° ða-˙ábba-w plì†la.} . . . ha-t-xáßli ""an-xê††e,}
      ""an-š6kwáne t-áw5 ðà-ða wára.} ‘The first ant went in and took one
      grain, then went out. The second went in and took a grain and went
      out. The third went in (and took) a grain and went out . . . and the
      ants were going in one by one until the wheat finished.’ (A36:5)

The perfective q†ille form of hwy is combined with the infinitive to express
a complete event in the past that has a finite duration with a starting-point
and end-point. The distinction between wele q†ala and other narrative
verbal forms such as q†ille and q†il5le is that this infinitive form explicitly
expresses duration in the past whereas the others do not specify this. Since
the event expressed by this form has an endpoint, it can be followed by
sequential actions, as is the case in (3) and (4):  (1) m6n-d-7-dan6t brèla} hál d-5-dán6t m†éla l-yàla,} wéla bxàya.} ‘From the
      time she was born until the time that she came to the boy she wept.’
      (A25:4)
  (2) ""ána k6mà dána t-in-mßalóye †la-márya ""àlaha} ta-t-yawèlli ""êmma dáwe.} ""u-
      ""áwwa huðáya wéle maßyó°e n†ára ""èlli l-gàre.} ‘I was praying to the Lord
      God so many times to give me a hundred gold coins. This Jew was
      listening and watching me on the roof (during this time period).’
      (A6:10)
  (3) har-wéla taq-táq mxàya} ""u-taq-tàq,} xá-bena-w trè,} w-áwwa sqìdle.} ‘They
      made a taq-taq knocking noise, taq-taq, once, then twice, then he
      became fed up.’ (A14:68)
  (4) ""àwwa} Xáno xzéle ""o-dídwa plí†le m6n-naxír6t málka mujêble.} wéle spàra,}
      xár°a xá-ga xéta xzèle} ""o-dìdwa} plí†le m6n-d-ó bór6t kèpe.} ‘Xano saw the
      fly come out of the nose of the king and was astonished. He waited
      (for some time) and then he saw the fly come back out of the pile
      of stones.’ (A11:5)Rather than denoting a complete event bounded by a start and an end,
the form is sometimes used ingressively to denote the start of a situation
without any definite endpoint. Another event mentioned in the ensuing
discourse, therefore, may take place while this situation still holds rather
than being sequential to its completion, e.g.  (5) ""ána síqa l-ßˆda,} dúnye wéla ràya,} ""ána wírri gu-xa-gêppa.} ‘I went up
      hunting, it started raining and so I went into a cave.’ (A28:6)
  (6) xá-ga xéta †líbla m6n-márya ""àlaha,} kúlla wéla bráka †lìbla,} ßléla mê†ra.}
      ‘Then they made a request from the Lord God, they all started
      kneeling and made a request, and (as a consequence) rain fell.’
      (A11:18)
  (7) ""a-políse wéla pyáša b-x6mmèy.} ‘The policemen began to become wor-
      ried.’ (A8:10)
726                           chapter fifteen15.4.2.8.6. wiy5le q†ala
This form is attested in (1), where it is used to express an enduring but
complete event in the past that has a finite duration with a starting-point
and end-point. As we have seen, the same function is performed by wele
q†ala. This arises from the fact that the q†ille and q†il5le forms are used
interchangeably in narrative.  (1) ""è°y5le xa-nàša} xa-súsa smòqa,} kúlle lwíša smòqa,} wíy6x pláša m-""aßèrta
      hal-gu-mbadlà°a.} lan-mèßya bíye dìye.} ‘A man came, on a red horse,
      all dressed in red. We fought from evening until morning. I could
      not prevail against him.’ (A12:19)15.4.2.9. Combined with Existential Particle
The infinitive form pyaša is sometimes combined with the existential par-
ticle when the verb has the sense of ‘to remain’. All the attested examples
have the negative particle:  (1) ‘ú m6ndí lítla pyàša.} ‘She no longer had anything.’ (A26:59)
  (2) lítlux pyáša pêrß6t,} dìya qa†lèxlux.} ‘You no longer have any opportunity
      (for escape), we shall kill you right now.’ (A26:76)
  (3) li°-pyáša ""ánna t-amrèxxa bòla díye.} ‘No more of its heads, as we call
      them, remain.’ (B5:97)
           15.5. Other Constructions with the Infinitive15.5.1. General Remarks
In some sections of the foregoing treatment of the compound infini-
tive construction with the verb ‘to be’ mention has been made of some
contexts in which the auxiliary verb is omitted. Most examples of this
omission cited above are infinitive constructions in narrative occurring
after a preceding infinitive bearing the copula, or occasionally before a
following infinitive bearing the copula. In such cases the infinitive with-
out the copula expresses an event that is closely connected with that of
the preceding or following clause respectively, in that they are presented
as being components of the same overall event. In this section we shall
examine further contexts in which an infinitive lacking a copula or form
of the verb hwy is used.
                              the syntax of verbs                                  727    With regard to the subject referent of an infinitive, this is in principle
either explicitly expressed together with the infinitive or, if not expressed,
it is the continuation of the subject referent of the preceding clause. An
exception to this is where the infinitive has an impersonal subject. This
is seen, for example, in (1), in which the infinitive †>ya has an impersonal,
unspecified 3pl. subject, which is not the subject of the preceding clause.
This infinitive, moreover, is the first of a sequence of two infinitives, the
preceding clauses having q†ille form verbs. The plural resultative participles
in the following clauses demonstrate that the subject of the infinitive is
3pl.:  (1) pílle šnèle.} †8ya bá°re díye la-xzày6lle.} xár°a tfíqe bíye xèzy6lle ""ína šênya,}
      npìla.} ‘He fell and fainted. They searched for him but did not find
      him. Then they came across him and found that he had fainted
      and fallen.’ (A14:87)In addition to narrative sequence, the infinitive is used in the contexts
described below. When the infinitive lacks the verb ‘to be’ in these con-
texts, it is still treated as a verb with regard to its syntactic relation to the
participants in the clause. The subject and direct object are combined
with the infinitive as they are with verbs, the infinitive never being linked
to these clausal participants by nominal annexation with the particle D.","[754, 755, 756, 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 762, 763, 764, 765, 766]"

             2.5. The Historical Background of the Vowels2.5.1. /i/
(i) In most cases this vowel derives from long *ì, e.g.
      sawi               ‘grandfather’            < *sà∫ì
      xazyali            ‘she sees me’            < *˙àzyàlì
      šaqli              ‘they take’              < *šàqlìn
      †¬a°i              ‘thirty’                 < *tlà∆ìn
      basima             ‘pleasant (ms.)’         < *bassìmà
      basimta            ‘pleasant (f.)           < *bassìmtà
      p°ixa              ‘open’                   < *p∆ìxà
      p°ixle             ‘he opened’              < *p∆ìxlehAs has been shown above (§2.2.2.1.), /i/ in closed syllables, as in basimta
and p°ixle, is generally pronounced short.(ii) Before /y/ in an open syllable, it sometimes derives from a short high
vowel in syllables that were originally closed by a pharyngal or laryngal
but became open after the elision of these consonants. For the sake of
convenience, this vowel can be represented here as *6, e.g.
                                  vowels                                 87     ßiya                ‘thirsty’                < *ß6hyà
     †iya                ‘searched’               < *†6""yà < *†6'yàSome cases of /i/ before /y/ in an open syllable originated as epenthetic
vowels, e.g.     tawriyá°a           ‘cows’                   < *tawrya°a
     zawriyá°a           ‘water pots’             < *zawrya°a
     manšíya             ‘she forgets’            < *manšyaCompare the singular noun forms taw6rta ‘cow’, zaw6rta ‘water pot’ and the
alternative 3fs. verbal form man6šya ‘she forgets’, in which the epenthetic
is placed before the preceding consonant.(iii) In a few words /i/ has developed by raising from an original *a before
the palatal glide /y/, e.g.
       miya               ‘water’                  < *maya
       riyana             ‘rain’                   < *rayana
       diya               ‘now’                    < *daya < *daha
       ‰iya               ‘shepherd’               < *‰aya < *rà'yàThe word ‰iya may have undergone an intermediate stage *‰eya in accor-
dance with the shift *a""C > *eC described below (§2.5.2.).
  The raising of *a to /i/ before a glide /y/ applies also to a few cases
where the glide is inserted between a final /a/ vowel of loanwords and
the Aramaic inflectional ending, e.g.     panj>riya           ‘window’                 < Kurd. pencere
     wastiya°a           ‘dresses’                < sing. wasta
     titiye              ‘silver ornaments’       < sing. tita2.5.2. /e/
(i) In some cases this derives from original long *è, e.g.
      reša               ‘head’                   < *rèšà
      kepa               ‘stone’                  < *kèpà
      k°awe              ‘books’                  < *k∆à∫è
      xaze               ‘he sees’                < *˙àzè
      xzel6n             ‘we saw’                 < *˙zèlan
88                             chapter two(ii) In several words it derives from short *a that was originally in a syl-
lable closed by following a laryngal *"" or *h, e.g.
      tela                ‘fox’                     < *ta""la < *ta'là
      †ena                ‘load’                    < *†a""na < *†a'nà
      p6r†ena             ‘flea’                    < *purta""nà < *purta'nà
      zreta               ‘cultivation’             < *zra""ta < *zra'tà
      ""arbe               ‘four (f.)’               < *""arba"" < *""arba'
      nera                ‘river’                   < *nahrà
      sera                ‘moon’                    < *sahrà
      be‰a                ‘light’                   < *bahrà
      ßewa                ‘thirst’                  < *ßahwà
      †era                ‘noon’                    < *†ahràAs can be seen from the examples above, the laryngal *"" is generally derived
ultimately from the pharyngal *'. The vowel shift, however, appears to have
been conditioned by the laryngal rather than the original pharyngal. This
is shown by the occurrence of the shift in words originally containing the
laryngal *h. Furthermore it is found also in words containing an original
*"" that cannot be reconstructed as deriving from the pharyngal *', e.g.     sebu°a       ‘old age’        < *sa""bu°a (cf. Syr. s""b ‘to become old’)In some words the raising of *a to /e/ in this context is not completely
fixed, in that forms with /e/ are used alongside with forms with /a/, e.g.     tela ~ tala         ‘fox’                    < *ta""là
     †ena ~ †ana         ‘load’                   < *†a""nà

     p6r†ena ~ p6r†ana   ‘flea’                   < *purta""nàIn some words, furthermore, the shift does not take place at all. There is
no clear phonetic conditioning that blocks the shift in these cases, which
suggests that its occurrence has become lexicalized, e.g.     nala                ‘horse-shoe’             < *na""la < *na'là
     pala                ‘labourer’               < *pa""la < *pa'là
     saða                ‘martyr’                 < *sahðà
     dawa                ‘gold’                   < *dahwà
                                 vowels                                 89Conversely the shift is occasionally found in words that contain no ety-
mological laryngal, e.g.     šeta               ‘year’                   < *šattà
     xušeba             ‘Sunday’                 < *xa-b-šabbàThe explanation seems to be that in such cases the sequence *CaCC
evolved initially into the sequence *Ca""C and then this conditioned the
vowel raising. So the development would be šeta < *ša""ta < *šattà, xušeba
< *xuša""ba < xa-b-šabbà. This reconstruction is supported by the existence
in the Qaraqosh dialect of the form ša""ta as an alternative to šata ‘year’
(Khan 2002: 43).(iii) In some words the /e/ is more easily reconstructed as deriving from
a short high vowel *6 before a laryngal. This applies to cases where the
vowel before the original laryngal is an epenthetic, e.g.
       "">reta           ‘layer of algae’         < *""ar6""ta < *""ar""- + ta
       t>re°a           ‘small door’             < *tar6""ta < *tar""- + ta
       q>re°a           ‘gourd’                  < *qar6""°a < *qar""- + ta
       n>re°a           ‘small axe’              < *nar6""°a < *nar""- + taIt also applies to other words that have /6/ in their original morphologi-
cal pattern, e.g.     de°a               ‘sweat’                  < *d6""°a
     magreta            ‘shaving knife’          < *magr6""ta
     mp5qele            ‘he exploded (tr.)’      < *mpuq6""le(iv) The vowel /e/ in a pretonic open syllable has sometimes developed
by lengthening of an original short *6 in other contexts. This applies, for
example, to some cases where the *6 developed by centralization of an
original short *a in an unstressed syllable that was closed by a geminated
consonant. After the gemination was weakened the syllable became open
and the *6 vowel was lengthened to /e/, e.g.
     genawa              ‘thief ’                  < *g6nnawa < *gannà∫à
     gewaya              ‘beggar’                  < *g6wwaya < *gawwàyà
     meqora              ‘hole’                    < *m6qqora < *maqqòrà
     nepoxta             ‘date syrup’              < *n6ppoxta < *nappoxta
90                              chapter twoFor all of these examples variant forms exist with /a/ in the first syllable.
These have developed directly from forms without centralized *6:     ganawa               ‘thief ’                    < *gannà∫à
     gawaya               ‘beggar’                    < *gawwàyà
     maqora               ‘hole’                      < *maqqòrà
     napoxta              ‘date syrup’                < *nappoxtaThe vowel /e/ in an open syllable at the end of adverbials such as qamaye
‘at first’, gawaye ‘inside’ and baraye ‘outside’, also developed by lengthening
of a short *6 that had resulted by attenuation of *a. In this case the short
*a was in an unstressed syllable that was originally closed by final *t, as
in Syr. qa≈màya∆ ‘at first’. We may reconstruct as follows qamaye < *qamay6t
< *qa≈màya∆.
   In some cases a short *6 was original in the pattern of the word in an
unstressed closed syllable before a geminated consonant. The vowel was
lengthened to /e/ when the gemination was weakened. Most words of
this type have variants that retain the gemination, e.g.     ""eli°a ~ ""6lli°a         ‘fat of a tail’
     mesukta ~ m6ssukta       ‘gizzard (of a bird)’
     gepona ~ g6ppona         ‘small cave’Short /6/ is lengthened to /e/ is some other contexts, e.g. mére ‘he said’
< m•re (A49:6).(v) Final –e in singular nouns is generally derived from an original *-yà,
e.g.
     l5le                ‘night’                  < *laylyà (Syr. lelyà)
     ""ore                ‘manger’                 < *""oryà (Syr. ""uryà)
     ""6rxe               ‘water-mill’             < *ra˙yà (Syr. ra˙yà)
     xuwwe               ‘snake’                  < *x6wyà (Syr. ˙ewyà)2.5.3. /5/
Most cases of /5/ have developed by contraction of an original diphthong
*ay, as has been described above (§2.4.1.). It normally occurs in open syl-
lables, e.g. b5°a ‘house’ < *bay∆à, xaz5li ‘they see me’ < *˙àzaylì, but on a
few occasions is found in closed syllables, e.g. ""5nta ‘air-hole’ < *""ayntà.
                                  vowels                                 91   The vowel /a/ is often raised to /5/ before /r/ in non-emphatic envi-
ronments. This applies both to short /a/ in closed syllables and long /a/
in open syllables. The process does not occur completely regularly in the
speech of all informants. Since, however, this is a distinctive feature of
the pronunciation of the C. Barwar dialect, it has been decided to rep-
resent it in the transcription where it is heard rather than conceal it by a
completely normalized orthography, e.g.     d5rta ~ darta               ‘courtyard’
     s5rga ~ sarga               ‘saddle’
     y5rxa ~ yarxa               ‘month’
     g y5rma ~ g yarma           ‘bone’
     p5rš6x ~ parš6x             ‘we divide’
     d5re ~ dare                 ‘he puts’
     š5re ~ šare                 ‘he begins’
     daw7ra                      ‘mule’The raising is blocked in emphatic environments, cf.     p5rma ~ parma               ‘she cuts’
     Ña‰ma                       ‘she understands’2.5.4. /a/
(i) This derives in most cases from an original short *a or long *à, though
the length of the vowel in the dialect is determined by syllable structure
and stress and not by its historical derivation from an original short or
long vowel, e.g.
     pá°xa [}pæ°xæ]      ‘she opens’              < *pà∆˙à
     kyása [}cyæ[sæ]     ‘stomach’                < *karsà(ii) As we have seen (§2.3.4.), in some cases a short /a/ in the transcrip-
tion derives by lowering from /5/, which in turn is a reflex of the diph-
thong *ay.2.5.5. /6/
(i) This may derive from an original short high vowel, which, for the sake
of convenience we may represent here with the same symbol *6, e.g.
92                             chapter two     gár6š               ‘he pulls’                < *gàr6š
     l•bba               ‘heart’                   < *l•bba(ii) In some cases it is the result of attenuation of an original /a/, /e/ or
/5/ in a closed syllable, e.g.
      gárš6t               ‘you (fs.) pull’         < *gàršà-t
      gárš6t               ‘you (ms.) pull’         < *gàršè-t
      gríš6t               ‘you have pulled’        < griš5t(iii) The reflex of an original long *ì is in principle /i/. An exception to
this is the past form of the verb to say, which has /6/, e.g. m•re ‘he said’
< *mìrrèh < *mìr + lèh.(iv) The vowel /6/ is found in both open and closed syllables as an epen-
thetic vowel, e.g.
     map•lxi             ‘they use’
     mat>m•mi            ‘they finish’2.5.6. /o/
(i) In many cases this derives from an original long *ò, e.g.
      na†ora             ‘guard’                  < *nà†òrà
      d6bbora            ‘hornet’                 < *d6bbòrà
      l-xoðe             ‘by himself ’            < *˙ò≈èh
      mšadore            ‘to send’                < *mšaddòrè(ii) Occasionally it has arisen by lengthening of an original short *u. This
has occurred when a closed syllable containing a short *u has become open
by the elision of a consonant or the weakening of gemination, e.g.
      mpol6†le            ‘he brought out’         < *mpull6†lèh
      ßabota              ‘finger’                 < *ßabbu'tà(iii) In several cases it has arisen by contraction of the diphthong *aw
(see §2.4.2.).2.5.7. /u/
(i) This is may be derived from an original short or long *u, e.g.
     ""urxa              ‘road’                  < *""ur˙à
     duk°a              ‘place’                 < *dukk 6∆à

     duwana             ‘oil, fat’               < *dùhànà(ii) On some occasions it has arisen in closed syllables by the shortening

                            CHAPTER THREE                    CONSONANT GEMINATION
            3.1. Phonetic Realization and TranscriptionThe physical duration of a consonant that is marked as geminate in the
transcription varies considerably. As a general rule the duration of a gemi-
nate consonant that is preceded by a stress is longer than one that lacks a
preceding stress. This can be seen by comparing the range of durations
of /ll/ in the following examples, in which the approximate duration of
the geminate consonant is measured in milliseconds:  (1)   máx6lla [}mæ[x6l](70)æ] ©ðàðe} ‘He knocks them together’ (A24:13)
  (2)   z•dy6lla [}zıdy6l](80)æ] tàma} ‘They threw down it there’ (A24:25)
  (3)   mùrr5-lli} [}mÛr[5[l[(115)i] ‘Tell them to me’ (A24:11)
  (4)   zílle [}zil](75)e] ‘He went’ (A24:4)
  (5)   kúlle [}kÛl[(130)e] ‘all of it’ (A24:11)
  (6)   šqúlle [}∫qÛl[(155)e] ‘Take it!’ (A24:15)
  (7)   g•lla} [}gıl[(190)æ[] ‘grass’ (A24:15)In words with the same stress position a geminate consonant is still real-
ized with a wide range of durations, as can be seen in (8)–(12), which
illustrate various attested durations for the geminate consonant /xx/ in
the word laxxa ‘here’:  (8) láxxa [}læx(50)æ] (A24:51)
  (9) láxxa [}læx](80)æ] (A24:4)
  (10) làxxa} [}læx[(95)æ] (A24:6)
  (11) làxxa} [}læx[(125)æ] (A24:6)
  (12) làxxa} [}læx[(185)a] (A24:49)As can be seen, there is a considerable difference in the duration with
which the sequence /xx/ is realized in this word. It tends to be longer at
the end of an intonation group, though even here there is a large variety
of realizations. The duration is reduced in forms that occur inside an
intonation group. Indeed this lower range of durations, as attested in (8)
96                            chapter threeand (9), overlaps with the durations attested for instances of the same
consonant that are represented in the transcription as non-geminate, as
can be seen in (13)–(17) below. In some cases, in fact, a non-geminate /x/
in these examples has a longer phonetic duration than geminate /xx/ in
examples (8)–(12):  (13) xa-da‰mána [x(60)æ-d)6‰}mæ[næ] ‘a remedy’ (A24:2)
  (14) ""an-tre-xéne [}x(70)e[ne]] ‘the other two’ (A24:5)
  (15) xa-šùla} [x(75)æ-∫u[læ[] ‘a job’ (A24:4)
  (16) xa-màlka} [x(80)æ-}mælkæ[] ‘a king’ (A24:1)
  (17) ""ixàla} [""i[}x(90)æ[læ[] ‘food’ (A24:16)The transcription of gemination that is adopted in this grammar does
not attempt to reflect the phonetic diversity of individual occurrences of
words that has just been described. The general principle that has been
followed is that a geminate consonant is consistently marked in a particular
lexical item or inflectional form, even where, on the phonetic level, the
duration of the consonant is reduced in some utterances of it. The choice
as to which words gemination should be marked in is based on relative
rather than absolute phonetic duration. In general, all other factors being
equal, certain lexical items or inflectional forms exhibit a more consistent
tendency for a consonant to be pronounced long than others and it is
in such cases that the consonants are marked as geminate. Consonants
that are marked as geminate would be expected to be pronounced long
consistently when the word occurs in pausal position at the end of an
intonation group, though the precise duration of this length may vary.
Of course, the term ‘gemination’ or ‘doubling’ strictly refers only to the
double marking of the letter in the orthography. As seen above in the
instrumental measurements, there is no question of exact doubling in
phonetic duration.
   The marking of consonant gemination in certain words in the transcrip-
tion is further justified by the existence of a number of minimal pairs in
which two words are distinguished only by the length of a consonant. The
absolute duration of the consonants in each member of the pair may be
increased or reduced according to the contextual position of the word,
but, all other factors being equal, there is clearly a relative difference in
length that has significance for meaning and for the morphological pat-
tern to which the words are assigned:

been identified. It should be noted, however, that the list above includes

pharyngal consonants.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137]"
"3.3.2. Gemination after Stressed Short Vowels
Gemination has developed in a number of cases after a stressed syllable
containing a short vowel that has become open due to the elision of a
consonant at the beginning of the next syllable. In some words where the
vowel in question is /6/ or /u/ the gemination regularly occurs, e.g.      d•mme                ‘tears’                < *d•me < *d6m'è
      Ñ•qqa                ‘split’                < *p•qa < *p6q'à
      q•††a                ‘piece’                < *q•†a < *q6†'à
      xúwwe                ‘snake’                < *x5we < *xuwyàIn words contaning the low vowel /a/, such secondary gemination does
not occur regularly and in most words is in free variation with forms
without it, e.g.      t8ra ~ tárra         ‘doors’                < *tar'à
      m8ra ~ márra         ‘illness’              < *mar'àThe gemination is stable, however, after an /a/ vowel in the numeral
‘seven’:      šáwwa                ‘seven’                < *š>wa < *ša∫'àWe may include here perhaps the demonstrative pronouns ""áwwa ‘this’ (m.)
and ""áyya ‘this’ (f.) and the adverbial támma ‘here’, in which gemination is
                           consonant gemination                          101a stable feature. It may have developed secondarily by a similar process
due to the elision of a laryngal:     ""áwwa                ‘this’ (m.)                 < *"">wa < *""awhà
     ""áyya                ‘this’ (f.)                 < *"">ya < *""ayhà
     támma                ‘here’                      < *t>ma < *támhàAnother exceptional form is the word ""axxa ‘here’ < *""àxà and its variant
láxxa ‘here’ < *l-àxà, in which the gemination appears to have developed
on account of the incidence of stress in the preceding syllable, despite
the fact that the vowel was originally long.","[139, 140]"
"19.1.1. Attributive Relative Clauses
Relative clauses that have attributive function are always placed after the
nominal that they modify. They may be explicitly connected to the head
nominal by the relative particle D, which is either prefixed to the first
word of the clause or is suffixed to the end of the head nominal, e.g. kut-
yala t-a°e laxxa ~ kut-yal6t ""a°e laxxa ‘Every child that comes here’. When
the particle is prefix to the first word of the clause, the final /a/ vowel
of the head noun is sometimes centralized to /6/ as is the case when the
particle is suffixed to it, e.g. ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla dmíxta kêsli ‘this beautiful
girl, who has fallen asleep with me’ (A26:6). The final /6/ is occasionally
elided, e.g. ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo ‘at the time that the bride came’ (B8:32). A
D particle is sometimes elided, but the final vowel of the head nominal
remains /6/ rather than /a/ as if it were still present, e.g. ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux
gáwa díya ‘the enclosure in which you threw it’ (< ""5-d5rt6t A15:18).
   Constructions with the particle D may be termed syndetic relative
clauses. Attributive relative clauses may also be placed after the head
nominal asyndetically, without the particle. The distribution of syndetic
and asyndetic attributive relative clauses is conditioned to a large extent by
the definiteness of the head nominal. A distinction should also be made
between restrictive relative clauses, which limit the reference of the head
noun, and non-restrictive ones, which present supplementary information
concerning a nominal without limiting its reference. This difference in
function sometimes gives rise to distinct syntactic structures.
952                           chapter nineteen19.1.1.1. Definite Head Nominal(i) Restrictive Clauses
When the head noun is definite, i.e. it has a specific identifiable refer-
ent or refers to an identifiable generic class, a restrictive relative clause
is syndetic. The clause has the function of an attributive modifier that
is embedded in the nominal phrase. It does not assert new information,
as is the case with an independent clause, but rather expresses informa-
tion that is presupposed to be known to the hearer. The clause supplies
a description that allows the hearer to identify the referent of the head
noun. The definite status of the head noun, therefore, is indissolubly
bound with the relative clause. In principle such a definite head noun is
introduced by an anaphoric demonstrative pronoun. This is usually the
default demonstrative pronoun, the basic function of which is to signal
that the referent of the noun is identifiable in the context to which it is
anaphorically linked. The restrictive relative clause, which is intended
to provide the means of identifying the referent, is sometimes the only
source of identification. The anaphoric link, therefore, is clearly internal
to the nominal phrase, e.g.  (1) ""an-suráye t-wáwa gu-Tùrkiya} zílla l-""Ir6n.} ‘The Christians who were in
      Turkey went to Iran.’ (B2:8)
  (2) šêdla,} gu-d-a-""8ra t-b8y6t mattêtle.} ‘You put the sapling in the land that
      you like.’ (B5:103)
  (3) ""7-baxta t-à°ya} b8y6n gawrênna} láz6m mtanyáli ða-q6ßßêtta.} ‘The woman
      who comes and I shall marry must tell me a story.’ (A36:1)In these constructions it can be said that the demonstrative is a correlative
with the relative particle. The demonstrative binds the head noun tightly
with the relative clause. This is because the interpretation of the noun with
the demonstrative depends on the relative clause and it cannot be inter-
preted successfully without it.
  In some cases the referent of the head noun has been mentioned in
the preceding context. Even here, however, the restrictive relative clause,
with which the head noun is syntactically linked, can be regarded as the
primary anaphor of the demonstrative and here also it has a correlative
function, e.g.  (4) ""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
      they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                          953  (5)   ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux gáwa díya kúlla genàwela.} ‘(As for) the enclosure in
        which you threw it, they are all robbers.’ (A15:18)The relative clauses in (4) and (5) can be interpreted as restrictive, in that
the head noun requires further description to ensure that the correct
referent is distinguished from other possible members of the set of items
named by the noun that are associated in some way with the context and
are, therefore, available as possible referents for the noun. The purpose
of the relative clause, therefore, is not to supply further information but
rather to assist in the identification of the referent. The anaphoric demon-
strative, which invites the hearer to seek the identification of the referent
of the noun in the surrounding context, would naturally be interpreted
in the first instance as linked to the relative clause that is embedded in
the nominal phrase.
   Restrictive relative clauses are used also after head nouns that have an
adverbial function, e.g.  (6)  ""7-šet6t m7°i q6m-yaw•lla xa-bróna zòra.} ‘In the year they would die
       he gave them a small son.’ (A4:57)
  (7) ""áp-ana y-a°7wa b-rèši hátxa} ""o-yóm6 t-ínwa zòra.} ‘They would come into
       also my head when (literally: in the day that) I was young.’ (A26:12)
  (8) ""7-g6t damêxwa,} †¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°à l5l>wá°a háwe dmìxa.} ‘When
       (literally: at the time that) he slept, he would be asleep for three
       days and three nights.’ (A29:2)
  (9) ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo,} yawíwala mêšxa.} ‘When (literally: at the time that)
       the bride came, they would give her oil.’ (B8:32)
  (10) hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n} har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘Until the day I die I
       shall always keep to God’s way.’ (A15:21)In some cases the head noun of a restrictive relative clause has a speaker
deixis demonstrative, e.g.  (11) ""ána ""ap-dìya} ""áyya ""úrxa t-ín ""ána zála bíya dìya} lè-y manš•nna hál
       yom6t-màw°a.} ‘I shall not give up until the day I die the way I am
       following now.’ (A21:35)
  (12) qímli zílli šqílli ""áwwa júlla t-íle gu-púmm6t mzíð6t pràge.} ‘I went and took
       the cloth that is in the mouth of the bag of millet.’ (A23:23)
  (13) xzi-""ánna †¬a-nàše} t-íla prím6lle tàwra,} †¬á°na hon-yíwt6lla mò'6d.} ‘Take
       note that the three people who slaughtered the ox—I have made
       an assignation with the three of them.’ (A22:21)
954                           chapter nineteenIn cases such as (11)–(13) the speaker deixis demonstrative should be
interpreted as having an anaphoric rather than an ostensive, i.e. ‘pointing’,
function. As shown in §14.3.2., the speaker deixis demonstrative is often
used with an anaphoric function where the speaker wishes to present the
referent in question with close perspective. The relative clause is restrictive
since it expresses presuppositional information that is intended to assist
with the identification of the head noun.
   The correlative function of demonstrative pronouns in restrictive rela-
tive clause constructions whereby they are linked by anticipatory anaphora
to the following relative clause (14) is likely to have been modelled on
nominal relative clauses (15):  (14) ""o-gáw‰a t-íle gu-bˆ°a} ‘The man who is in the house’
  (15) ""o-t-íle gu-bˆ°a} ‘He who is in the house’In nominal relative clauses such as (15), which are always restrictive, the
demonstrative occurs as the obligatory head of the clause, which cannot
stand independently. The construction (14) can be regarded as an inter-
nal expansion of (15), whereby the nominal head is an extension of the
pronominal head.(ii) Non-restrictive clauses
Non-restrictive relative clauses following definite head nouns are semanti-
cally closer to independent clauses than attributive modifiers. Their purpose
is to supply an additional description of a referent that is assumed to be
already identifiable. They are, therefore, assertive rather than presuppo-
sitional, though the syntactically subordinate structure has the effect of
presenting the information as backgrounded. Examples:  (1)   m•re †la-Zìne,} t-b>yéla M9mo} ‘He said to Zine, whom M>mo loved’
        (A26:64)
  (2)   zìl5le} mùkl6lla táwre t-w7wa zráya.} ‘He went and stopped the oxen,
        which were ploughing.’ (A9:5)
  (3)   qímle b-zdáya m-x•lme díye t-wéwa xêzy6lle.} ‘He began to be afraid of
        his dream, which he had dreamt.’ (A8:19)
  (4)   ""u-""up-báxte dìye} t-íle gwìr6lla} rába hawnànt5la.} ‘Also his wife, whom
        he had married, was very clever.’ (A17:21)It can be seen that in some cases the relative clause is separated from the
head noun by an intonation group boundary. This feature, however, is not
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                         955exclusive to non-restrictive relative clauses, as can be seen in (13) in section
(i) above, where it occurs in a construction with a restrictive clause.
    In (5) it is separated from the head not only by an intonation group
boundary but also by intervening components of the clause:  (5) n•mu ""áyya b•rke d-ˆnila} t-it-""áti sxáya gàwa?} ‘Whose is this pool in which
      you are swimming?’ (A25:61)The non-restrictive relative clauses in constructions such as (1)–(5) may
express information that is familiar to the hearer, but, crucially, the speaker
is presenting them as assertions, albeit in some cases recapitulatory, rather
than as presuppositions. Sentences with an embedded non-restrictive
relative clause, therefore, contain two assertions, the truth of which can
be assessed independently of one another. In (1), for example, there are
two assertions, viz. (i) ‘He said to Zine’ and (ii) ‘M>mo loved Zine’. In a
sentence with an embedded restrictive relative clause, on the other hand,
there is only one assertion. Example (i 1), for instance, only asserts ‘The
Christians who were in Turkey went to Iran’. It does not entail the assertion
‘The Christians were in Turkey’. If an unidentified head noun requires
further delimitation in order for its referent to be identified, it is natural
to link it with a description based on a familiar, presupposed proposition
(‘There were Christians in Turkey’) rather than one based on an as yet
unknown proposition. When the head noun is identifiable in that it occurs
in a context where there is judged to be no possible confusion with other
members of the set of items named by the noun, any further description
must be assertive. As remarked, however, the syntactically subordinate
status of this assertion in the non-restrictive relative clause presents it as
background information. The informativeness of the clause may, indeed,
be very low, as in (4), where the hearer would naturally assume that if
a man has a wife, he would have married her! The construction can,
however, be interpreted as the assertion of an event that is added as an
afterthought, which would be equivalent to a sequence of clauses such as
‘He married a woman. His wife was also very clever’.
   The distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive relatives is based
on the availability of other potential referents for the head noun in the
particular context in which the construction occurs. In (6), for example,
the clause can be interpreted as restrictive and presuppositional, since
it occurs in a context where other girls are on the scene. In (7), on the
other hand, there is only one basket on the scene, so the relative should
be interpreted as non-restrictive and assertive.
956                            chapter nineteen  (6)   ""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
        they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
  (7)   hat šmí†le ""5-sála t-wéwa zqìr6lla.} ‘Until the basket which he had
        woven was shattered.’ (A20:4)In the context preceding (7), it has already been stated that the character
in question wove the basket. The assertion of the relative clause, there-
fore, must be expressing recapitulatory backgrounded information. An
assertion with such a low degree of informativeness appears, indeed, to
be closely related pragmatically to a presupposition. It is, no doubt, for
this reason that a relative construction is used to express both types of
clauses. Moreover the less informative the relative clause is, the more it
serves as a device to recapitulate and refresh the identification of the
noun, the closer it is in function to that of a restrictive relative clause.
The pragmatic relationship between a presupposition and an assertion
can be regarded as a continuum rather than a clear dichotomy, which
one can represent thus:Presupposition > Recapitulatory backgrounded assertion > backgrounded
assertion > foregrounded assertionIt follows, therefore, that the relationship between restrictive and non-restric-
tive relative clauses is a continuum rather than a distinct dichotomy.
    A feature that is distinctive of many non-restrictive clauses is the absence
of a correlative demonstrative on the head noun that binds the head to the
relative clause. In examples (1)–(4) the head has no demonstrative. In some
cases the head noun has a demonstrative, but this cannot be interpreted
as having a correlative function. Consider the following cases:  (8)  xzìg6n} ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla dmíxta kêsli.} ‘Look at this beautiful girl,
       who has fallen asleep with me.’ (A26:6)
  (9) ""u-d5r7le r6š-d-ó-sela t-íle núra xó°e xamìma.} ‘They put it on the grid-
       dle, under which there is fire (and which is) hot.’ (B6:47)
  (10) hat šmí†le ""5-sála t-wéwa zqìr6lla.} ‘Until the basket which he had
       woven was shattered.’ (A20:4)In (8) the speaker deixis demonstrative is ostensive and points to the ref-
erent in the speech situation, the relative clause supplying an additional
description of the girl, which is not essential for identifying the referent
of the noun. In (9) and (10), already considered above, the head noun
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                         957has been mentioned previously and there are no competing referents in
the context. The default demonstratives, therefore, can be interpreted as
binding the noun anaphorically to the preceding context. Since, however,
in both cases the relative clauses are low in informativeness and recapitu-
late information that has already been given, it can be said that they play
a role of refreshing the identification of the head noun, especially since
the head nouns have no other attributes that assist in identification. The
demonstratives would, therefore, have some kind of anaphoric relation-
ship also with the relative clause as well as with the mention of the noun
in the preceding context.
   In (11) the head noun has the demonstrative + indefinite article construc-
tion (""an-xa), which links the noun anaphorically with an earlier conversation
in the memory of the interlocutor (§14.3.5.). The relative is non-restrictive,
since the noun refers to the entire class and does not extract a sub-set
of ‘washing-boards’ that is in contrast to another sub-set. As in (9) and
(10), the content of the relative clause is recapitulatory in nature and is
intended to assist refreshing the identification of the referent:  (11) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle bíya.}
       ‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards which
       I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)The head of a non-restrictive relative may be an adverbial expression, as
in constructions such as (12) and (13):  (12) ""•dyo t-íla mì°ta,} hótu pšàma ""•lla díya.} ‘Today, when it has died, you
       are sad about it.’ (A5:10)  (13) dìya} t-xzéle málka dúnye ráya pà‰e} zawn-šlàm5le.} ‘Now that the king
       has seen it raining lambs, it is the time of peace.’ (A1:26)A non-restrictive relative clause sometimes has the form of a nominal
relative clause, with a pronominal head, placed in apposition to the
antecedent noun, e.g.  (14) ""ína bráta d-o-Xáno Lapzèrin,} d-o-t-wéwa b•nya D6mdêma,} b>yáwa
       ta-bròn-màlka.} ‘But the daughter of that Xano the Golden Hand,
       who had built D6md6ma, loved the son of the king.’ (A11:17)
  (15) ""•°y5le ""o-gàw‰a díya,} ""o-t-wéwa mù°y6lla.} ‘That husband of hers came
       back, the one who had brought her.’ (A12:53)
958                           chapter nineteen  (16) m•re †la-xuláme dìye} ""o-t-wéwa ""•°ya m6n-ßˆda} ‘He said to his servant,
       who had come from the hunt’ (A25:54)
  (17) m-yêmmin šmít6lla ""áyya,} m-bnòn-mámi ""an-t-w7wa gò‰e.} ‘I heard this
       from my mother, from my cousins, who were older.’ (B8:5)These types of construction typically occur where the referent of the
head noun is unambiguously identifiable due to the noun being a proper
noun (15) or a noun that is delimited by a pronominal suffix (16–17). The
head noun is, therefore, not dependent on the relative clause either for
primary identification (restrictive) or for a refreshment of identification
as in (9) and (10) described above. The relative clause, therefore, can be
said to be pragmatically more independent from the head nominal than
is the case with restrictive constructions and constructions such as (9) and
(10). This greater degree of pragmatic independence is reflected by a
greater degree of syntactic independence, in that the nominal relative is
potentially a free-standing item, which is in apposition to the preceding
noun. An attributive relative clause without this opening demonstrative,
on the other hand, is a dependent modifier and is linked indissolubly to
the antecedent noun.
   Note that in (14) and (15) the antecedent noun has a demonstrative,
which refers anaphorically to the preceding context. In (14) the genitive
particle that is attached to the head noun (d-o-Xáno Lapzèrin) is repeated
on the appositive relative phrase (d-o-t-wéwa b•nya D6mdêma). For this phe-
nomenon in other appositional constructions see §14.7.
   In (18) an appositive type of non-restrictive relative clause follows a head
noun whose referent is a generic class and so is assumed to be identifiable:  (18) béna ""í° linyà°a,} lìne,} linyá°a ""an-t-íla ""àxÄar.} ‘There were pots, pots,
       pots, which are green.’ (B10:75)In some cases clauses expressing supplementary background information
which could be translated idiomatically into English by a non-restrictive
relative clauses are presented as an independent clause juxtaposed asyn-
detically after a definite noun, e.g.  (19) ßléla yóm6t trè} ""al-f 9qih,} ""ítle d6kkàna.} ‘She went down the next day
       to the jurist, who had a shop.’ (A22:16)
  (20) módi b6d-manáy6 d-áyya †àsa} dàwa,} šqilál6n m-àxxa,} n6blál6n gu-d-yáha
       dˆrta?} ‘What about the meaning of that golden bowl, which we took
       from here and took away to that house enclosure?’ (A15:17)

When the head nominal is indefinite, an attributive relative clause may
be syndetic or asyndetic.(i) Restrictive Clauses
When the relative clause after an indefinite head noun is restrictive, the
construction is usually syndetic. Only an indefinite noun with a non-specific
referent can have a restrictive relative clause. The restrictive relative clause
does not assist in identification of the referent, since indefinite nominal
phrases in principle have an unidentified referent. Rather the clause nar-
rows the extension of the set denoted by the noun. In many cases the
indefinite noun has a universal quantifier (kut, kull). The verb in the relative
clause is either in a realis form (1–3) or in an irrealis form (4–6):  (1) kú-duk6 t-íla m5°êtlali.} ‘Bring her to me wherever she is.’ (A4:8)
  (2) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""•lle dìye.} ‘Let’s look and
      find a man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
  (3) kú-m6ndi t-ítley t-yáwi ""êllux.} ‘They will give you everything that they
      have.’ (B7:7)
  (4) ku-náš6t ""àw6r,} ku-xayú°6t ""áw6r gu-d-ay-wàdi} ""ánna š6kwáne t-axlìla.} ‘Any
      person who enters, every living thing that enters in this valley, the
      ants will eat it.’ (A14:55)
  (5) hátxa xazêxwale} ku-dùk°a t-awéwa.} ‘We would see him wherever he
      could be.’ (B9:29)
  (6) kúl-naša t-awéle xa-bròna,} . . . ""i-nablíle l-""ùmra.} ‘Anybody who has a
      son, . . . they take him to the church.’ (B6:35)The difference between the constructions with the realis form and those
with the irrealis form relates to commitment of the speaker to the existence
of the class denoted by the nominal phrase. As remarked, in all cases the
nominal has a non-specific referent. When the realis is used, the speaker
is committed to the existence of at least one referent in the class denoted
by the phrase, although he is not referring to one particular member of
this class. In (1) the speaker is committed to the existence ‘a place where
she is’, i.e. that there is some place where she is to be found. In (2) the
implication is that there is some man who is a hard worker, though the
speaker is not referring to anyone particular in this class. In (3) the impli-
cation is that the people in question have some possessions that they can
give. When, on the other hand, the irrealis is used, the speaker is not
committed to the existence of any referent in the class. The existence
960                             chapter nineteenof such a referent is only hypothetical and the class may be empty.1 In
(4) the speaker is not committed to the existence of a person who enters
the valley, but presents it as a hypothetical possibility. It is, therefore,
equivalent to the hypothetical conditional construction ‘If a person were
to enter . . .’. In (5) the speakers are not committed to the existence of any
place where the man in question is to be found, i.e. he has disappeared.
In (6) the speaker presents the birth of a son to a person as a possibility
(= If somebody has a son . . .) rather than a certainty (= When somebody
has a son . . .). It is presented as a hypothetical case with regard to one
representative individual of the set.
   It should be noted that in some cases, particularly in subordinate clauses,
the qa†6l or qa†6lwa forms are used in a habitual indicative sense and so are
not formally distinguished from their irrealis usage (§15.1.1.3., §15.1.2.2.).
The realis or the irrealis meaning of the verb in the relative clause must,
therefore, be deduced from the context. In a construction such as (7), for
example, where there is an explicit statement of the existence of referents
of the class, the verb must be interpreted as realis:  (7) ""í°wa baxtá°a t-y8ði t-yàpi.} ‘There were women who knew how to
      bake.’ (B5:16)The use of the realis copula in the relative clause modifier of the pred-
icative noun in (8) commits the speaker to the fact that the person was a
good man who brought the coins. What he is denying is that he became
such a man of his own accord:  (8) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} záwna wíy5le t-šlàma} ""áp-
      ati píšlux náš6t šlàma.} ‘You have not become a good man who has
      brought those coins. Time became one of peace and so also you
      became a man of peace.’ (A2:26)A t- prefix attached to an initial / ""/ verb that has a future sense could, in
principle, be interpreted as the future verbal prefix or the relative particle, e.g.  (9) ku-b7°a t-àzeti} ""áni t-yawìlux.} ‘Every home that you go to will give you
      something.’ (B7:7)
   1
     This may be compared to the use of the subjunctive in relative clauses in Romance
languages such as French (cf. Kleiber 1987: 69–75).
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                           961  (10) t-áwð6t b-xàbri,} kú-m6ndi t-amrênnux?} ‘Will you act on my word,
       everything that I tell you?’ (A15:5)Occasionally the relative particle is omitted before a restrictive relative
clause that modifies an indefinite head noun, e.g.  (11) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
       she goes to and enters, the other has to follow after her.’ (B12:2)
  (12) kút-dana sanqìwa,} ""u-šaqlíwa m6n-d-5-tÆtun.} ‘Whenever they needed
       it, they took some of that tobacco.’ (B7:18)
  (13) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-y•mma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.} ‘A
       man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or anybody,
       they say that he has no relatives.’ (A17:17)
  (14) ku-brón6t b•‰-naša ""á°e l-d-áy j>zíra qamàye,} ""áwwa t-áwe málka diyˆxu.}
       ‘Whichever person comes to the island first, he will be your king.’
       (A14:46)In some cases such an asyndetic clause occurs after a class term in pred-
icative position, e.g.  (15) m5jíwale gu-míya šaxìne,} p5šíwa dàwwe} y-oðíwa bušàla bíya díya,} ""u-kót6l
       dàwke bíya díya.} ‘They crushed it in hot water and it became yoghurt
       water, with which they would make stew and yoghurt pasties.’
       (B7:23)(ii) Non-Restrictive Clauses
Unlike restrictive relative clauses, non-restrictive relative clauses may occur
both after indefinite nouns with specific referents and also after those with
non-specific referents.
    In the text corpus there are numerous occurrences of indefinite nouns
with a specific referent followed by a clause that can be rendered into
English by a non-restrictive relative clause. In such constructions the non-
restrictive clause is, in principle, juxtaposed asyndetically to the noun, e.g.  (1)   ""ì°wa} xa-ràbb6n,} tíw5wa gu-xa-g6ppì°a.} ‘There was once a monk who
        lived in a cave.’ (A15:1)
  (2)   ""í°wa xa-nàša} gu-ða-mà°a,} rába rába duglàna-wewa.} ‘There was a man
        in a village who was a great liar.’ (A48:1)
  (3)   ""í°wa xa-g•ppa gáwe díye ""àrbi hambišáye.} ‘There was a cave in which
        there were forty giants.’ (A24:54)
962                           chapter nineteen  (4)  ""í°wa xa-bustàna,} ""í°wa xabùše gáwa.} ‘There was a garden, in which
       there were apples.’ (A24:24)
  (5) ""í°wa xa-""á©a gu-Bˆrw6r,} š•mme Raš‰d-bek.} ‘There was an agha in
       Barwar whose name was Rašid Bek.’ (B19:1)
  (6) q6m-xazéle xa-nàša} mì°a} naból6lle m†amòr6lle.} ‘He saw a dead person,
       whom they were taking to bury.’ (A17:1)
  (7) hon-d•ry6lle gu-xa-‘ále ""amúqta lá-""am6ß ‘ù-ga ‘ú-ga pàl6†.} ‘I put him in
       a deep hole from which he could never come out.’ (A22:41)
  (8) ""ína hóla xá-qay6m°a k°íwta tàma,} málka Šlémun k°ìw6lla.} ‘They found
       there an inscribed monument, which king Solomon had written.’
       (A14:55)
  (9) šqílt5la xa-‘ánta hátxa á¬ì°5la.} ‘She took a basket that was full like
       this.’ (A22:13)
  (10) hón mquwálta m-xa-tèla} q6m-xal•ßli m-nêmra.} ‘I have given a promise
       to a fox who has saved me from a tiger.’ (A47:7)In the light of this pattern of construction, the t- particle on the verb in (11)
is best identified not as the relative particle but rather as a reduced form
of b6d- in a b6d-qa†6lwa functioning as a sequential habitual (§15.1.6.3.):  (11) ""í° xá †awálta xéta t-amríwala ""òr†a.} ‘There is another game, which
       is called ""o‰ta.’ (B11:25)If the non-restrictive relative clause is a copula clause, the copula is some-
times omitted, which is a reflection of the semantic dependence of the
clause on what precedes (§17.6.1.), e.g.  (12) hóle °éle xa-nàša,} rába qále basìma.} ‘A man has come, whose voice is
       very beautiful.’ (A25:46)19.1.1.3. Synopsis of Attributive Relative Structures
The predominant trends in the distribution of the various attributive rela-
tive structures may be summarized as follows, where AN = Antecedent
Noun, S = relative clause, D = relative particle:(i) AN—D—S        Definite AN+ restrictive S
        Definite AN + non-restrictive S
        Indefinite AN + restrictive S
                     syntactic subordination of clauses                963(ii) AN—""o-D—S     Definite AN + non-restrictive S(iii) AN—S (asyndetic)     Indefinite AN + non-restrictive S
     Indefinite AN + restrictive S
     Definite AN + non-restrictive SIt can be seen that connection with D (i) and asyndetic connection (iii)
are used for both definite and indefinite antecedent nouns. A connection
with a demonstrative pronoun ""o-D (ii) is available only for structures with
a definite antecedent. The tendency to use a synthetic connection with D
as opposed to an asyndetic connection depends on the definiteness of the
antecedent and on the restrictiveness of the relative. There is a greater
tendency to use the synthetic connection with the antecedent when it is
definite than when it is indefinite and there is a greater tendency to do
so when the relative is restrictive than when it is non-restrictive. These
tendencies may be represented thus:     Definite >       Indefinite
     Restrictive >    Non-restrictiveThe operation of these tendencies results in the fact that the synthetic
connection may be used with an indefinite antecedent, but this is limited
to restrictive relatives. With definite antecedents, on the other hand, the
synthetic connection has a wider distribution and may be used also with
non-restrictive relatives. The appositional type of connection with ""o-D is
available only for non-restrictive relatives with a definite antecedent. The
distribution of the various connection strategies may be represented in the
following table, in which the line running to the right of an item (——|)
indicates the extent of the distribution of this item:                        Restrictive > Non-restrictive
     Definite AN:       D ——————————|""o-D | Ø |
     Indefinite AN:     D —| Ø ———————————— |From a comparative point of view, it is worth noting that the appositional
type of relative clause with ""o-D has a wider distribution in some NENA
964                           chapter nineteendialects. In J. Arbel, for example, this type of structure is frequently used
to express restrictive as well as non-restrictive relatives, e.g.  (1) ˙éleq ""o-t-la-yàlwa,} ""ìtwa našé xe†íwa ta-©ér našé.} ‘Anyone who did not
      know (how to sew)—there were people who sewed for others.’ (Khan
      1999: 387)
  (2) kré ""o-t-lošìlu} ‘The suits that they wear’ (Khan 1999: 388)
  (3) ""iyyá m6ndixanòx ""o-t-mírox baqí.} ‘Here are the things of yours that you
      asked me for.’ (Khan 1999:388)The situation in C. Barwar, in which the appositional construction is
restricted to non-restrictive relatives may be regarded as typologically
more archaic. As remarked above, the looser syntactic connection of the
appositive nominal relative corresponds iconically to the looser pragmatic
connection of the non-restrictive relative to the antecedent noun. In
J. Arbel the apposition construction has been generalized from non-
restrictive to restrictive clauses. This has come about, no doubt, due to
the aforementioned lack of clear pragmatic dichotomy between the two
types of relatives.","[990, 991, 992, 993, 994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003]"
"17.6.1. Clauses Expressing Supplementary Information
The verb ‘to be’ is sometimes omitted when the situation expressed by the
clause is presented by the speaker as information that is supplementary
to what is expressed in the adjacent clauses, e.g.  (1) xa-náša díye t-ám6rwa ""ána zonènna b-""êßra,} šaqlíwa ""èßra dinàre.} ""u-xéna
      t-ám6rwa zonènna b-xamšàss6r,} šaqlíwa xamšàss6r.} qa-xumlàna ""áwwa

      they would receive ten dinars. Another would say “I shall buy it for
      fifteen” and they would receive fifteen. This was for fun.’ (B5:42)
  (2) ""áy y-amríla x>dáy6t xêtna.} yá'ni xa-x6llèta †la-xètna ""ap-áyya.} ‘This is

      was for honey, one was for oil, one was for jaj6k, one was for cheese.’
      (B8:11)In (6) the speaker has omitted the copula in the first clause since it is
presented as the background to the following statement concerning the
main protagonist of the narrative. This can be captured in English by
translating it with a subordinate construction such as one introduced by
‘whereas’ or ‘while’:  (6) ""ína kúlla ""an-xéne bná°6t guràne,} ""áyya Šóše brát6t faqìre-wawa.} ‘Whereas all
      the others were daughters of gentlemen, this Šoše was the daughter
      of poor people.’ (A38:3)The expression of the verb ‘to be’ is sometimes omitted in clauses describ-
ing a state that is circumstantial to an action expressed in an adjacent
clause. Such clauses are sometimes introduced by the connective particle
w, e.g.  (7) bróni hóle xíla ""6dlˆle,} gu-dargúšta dmìxa.} ‘My son was eaten tonight
      while asleep in his cradle.’ (A18:2)
  (8) m-l7le qìm5le,} ""o-xuláme dìye.} táwre mpúl†6lla-w nùbl6lla} ""u-tullèk°a m6nne-

expressed by an independent pronoun when there is a change in subject
from the preceding clause, e.g.  (10) napßènna kúlla b-réše dìye,} ßáli tàma,} ""áwwa dmíxa gu-d-áw ""òt6x.} ‘I’ll
       shake them all over him and they will go down there (in the house),

       ‘They will see these clothes of yours like this, the smart suit and
       this donkey of yours, with the saddle, while I am in these plain
       clothes and slippers, all dirty, and the judge will make a sentence
       in your favour.’ (A6:7)When the subject of the circumstantial clause is the same as in the preced-
ing clause, it is sometimes expressed by an independent pronoun, e.g.  (12) y-azíwa zrà""a,} y-azíwa xzàda,} y-azíwa m5°óye mèndi ta-bˆ°a} ""áni ßìme.}
       ‘They would go to cultivate (the fields), go to harvest, go and bring
       things for the house, while they were fasting.’ (B16:17)In some cases, however, there is no morphological expression of the
subject, e.g.  (13) ""u-là-mßal5wa qa-""álaha,} har-dbíše b-bronèy.} ‘They did not pray to
       God, being constantly attached to their son.’ (A15:17)Of a similar nature are imperative expressions such as qu-qima! ‘Stand
up!’ (literally: ‘Stand while being standing’), tu-tiwa! ‘Sit down!’ (literally:
‘Sit while being seated’), páqðu tìwe!} ‘Please sit down’ (A15:8) (§15.7.
examples 42–44).
   The close connection of the reduced circumstantial clause to the main
clause is sometimes expressed prosodically by combining the two in the
same intonation group, e.g.  (14) ""ána majbúr-iw6n t-áz6n qá†l6n gáni pálx6n w-áy dmíxta maxlênna?} ‘Was
       I obliged to kill myself working to feed her while she was asleep?’

  (15) kú-mdit láy6p náša yála zòra} ""áyya pyàša gu-réš6t náša.} ‘Everything that
       a person learns (while he is) a young child, this remains in the
       mind of person.’ (B8:20)
852                          chapter seventeenThe copula is sometimes omitted in questions. This is found in questions
that are used as a device to introduce information that is supplementary
to what precedes, e.g.  (16) ""ay-""ilána ""ˆka?} masqíwala gàre.} ‘Where is the tree? They take it up
       to the roof.’ (B5:39)
  (17) ""o-Dáwið mòdi šúle díye?} máxewa darmàna} l-ßàwle} xáy6†wa ßàwle.} ‘What
       is the profession of that David? He used to polish shoes and sew
       shoes.’ (A16:1)In (19) the copula is omitted in a clause expressing a supplementary piece
of information that the speaker has previously forgotten:  (18) bína ""ána ""áxxa nšéli xa-mêndi.} k yàlo} ""íman t-a°yàwa} pá°a díya mkusˆ°a.}
       k yàlo} pá°a díya mkusˆ°a.} ‘But I have forgotten something here. The
       bride, when she came, her face was covered. The bride’s face was
       covered.’ (B5:35)17.6.2. Gapping in a Series of Clauses
The expression of the verb ‘to be’ is sometimes omitted also in a series of
clauses of equivalent status in the discourse. In a series of closely related
clauses, ‘gapping’ of the expression of the verb ‘to be’ may take place in
the clauses that follow the first of the series. This is found, for example,
in (1) and (2), in which clauses of parallel structure are linked together.","[888, 889, 890, 891]"
"15.1.5.1. Predictive Future
One of the basic functions of the b6d-qa†6l form is to express the future
tense. In cases where the subject of the verb is 3rd person or where it is a
non-agentive 1st or 2nd person, this is generally a predictive future, e.g.  (1)   b-nayêsli} t-axêlli.} ‘He will bite me. He will eat me.’ (A1:17)
  (2)   ""áp-""ana b-qa†êlli.} ‘He will kill me also.’ (A42:3)
  (3)   ""áy hóla dmìxta.} yóm6t ""àrbi b-q7ma.} ‘She is asleep. On the fortieth
        day she will get up.’ (A24:17)

        (A8:47)
  (5)   b-qlábtux b-xazènna Bèlb6l Hazàr mènnux.} ‘When you return I shall
        see B6lb6l Hazar with you.’ (A8:52)
  (6)   ""áy šaqí°a bt-áza. ‘The channel will flow.’ (A8:11)
  (7)   kút-yom t-á°i làxxa.} ‘They will come here every day.’The form is perfective, since it presents actions delimited with a start and
end point or at least with a start point. The form may also express itera-
tive aspect (7). In this context the form can still be interpreted as perfec-
tive, in that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each
individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation.
   The predicted events may be about to occur in the very near future, as
is shown by (8) and (9), where the verb is used with the adverb ‘now’:  (8)   hadíya t-à°ya Zíne,} ""arbí b5rbiyá°a mênna.} ‘Now Zine is going to come
        with forty bridesmaids.’ (A26:78)
  (9)   díya t-á°i p5rmìl6n.} ‘Now they are going to come to slaughter us.’
        (A4:54)The expression of imminence may be intensified by the phrase h6nt-ila ‘It
is a little’ (Kurd. hind), e.g.  (10) hènt-ila t-à°e} ‘He will come very soon’The b6d-qa†6l form is used as a future tense in direct or indirect interroga-
tive clauses, e.g.  (11) ""7ka b-kále Gozàli?} ‘Where will Gozali stay?’ (A8:51)
  (12) xáz6x mò-t-aw6ð.} ‘Let’s see what he will do.’ (A4:21)
  (13) xáz6n mó bt-amêrri.} ‘I’ll see what he’ll say to me.’ (A8:43)15.1.5.2. Deontic Future
When the verb has an agentive 1st singular subject the b6d-qa†6l form
generally has a modal sense expressing deontic intention, e.g.  (1)   b-ßàly6n} b-tápq6n bìye.} ‘I shall go down to meet him.’ (A4:21)
  (2)   ""àp-""ana bt-áz6n šúla} pàlx6n.} ‘I also shall go and work.’ (A23:1)
  (3)   b-zonènne b-xamšì dináre.} ‘I shall buy it for fifty dinars.’ (A24:23)
  (4)   t-yawènnux zùzux.} ‘I shall give you your money.’ (A1:10)
600                             chapter fifteenThe intention may be to perform the action in the immediate future,
e.g.  (5)   hadíya b-zadrànna gáni.} ‘Now I am going to shake myself.’ (A24:27)When expressing deontic intention the b6d-qa†6l form is occasionally com-
bined with the particle of immediacy d6-/de-, e.g.  (6)   ""ána d6-t-amrènnox ""ó-mdi-t taxrênne.} ‘I shall tell you what I remember.’
        (B15:1)
  (7)   pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle dìye.} ‘I shall give him half of my gold.’
        (A14:92)When the verb has an agentive 1st plural subject, the form often has a
cohortative modal sense (Let’s . . .), e.g.  (8)  bt-àrqexi.} ‘Let’s flee.’ (A30:41)
  (9)  bas-t-ázexi †albèxla m-bába dìya.} ‘But let us go and ask her father for
       her hand.’ (A29:38)
  (10) b-súr6° l7ð6n mú y-amrìle,} t-ámr6x mtag6bràna.} ‘I do not know what
       they call it in sur6°, let’s say “governor.” ’ (B6:47)The form may express deontic obligation. In such cases the verb generally
has an agentive 2nd person subject, e.g.  (11) ""ati bt-àzet.} ‘You should go.’ (A8:46)
  (12) t-azítu qam-d-o-gêppa,} ""aw-gèppa rába ramàn5le.} b-qarìtu:} ""ó Bèlb6l Hazàr!}
       ‘You should go to the cave, the cave is very high. You should cry
       “Oh B6lb6l Hazar.” ’ (A8:28)
  (13) b-zˆn6t} gót6t d-an-xoránux xène} ""u-b-qàr6t.} t-ámr6t ""ó Bèlb6l Hazàr!} ‘You
       should stand next to the others, your friends, and call out. You
       should say “Oh B6lb6l Hazar!” ’ (A8:48)Occasionally the form expresses deontic obligation also in other persons,
e.g.  (14) t-áz6l †alèbla m-be-bába diya.} ‘He should go and ask her father’s
       family for her hand.’ (A29:39)
  (15) ""èlla b-šaqlênna} xá°6t Mir-Zándin barxênna-llux.} ‘But I must first take
       the sister of Mir Zandin to marry her to you.’ (A26:39)

ing deontic obligation (‘What should he do?’) or deontic possibility (‘What
can he do?’), whereby the speaker addresses the hearer expecting him to
impose an obligation or give permission, e.g.  (16) políse mù t-óði?} ‘What should/can the police do?’ (A8:9)
  (17) mó t-oðèna?} ‘What should/can I do?’ (A1:17)
  (18) mò t-ámr6n ""ána?} ‘What should/can I say?’ (A26:34)It is occasionally used to express deontic possibility in other contexts, for
example in the expression t-amr6t ‘you could say’, which is used to intro-
duce comparative descriptions as in (19) and (20):  (19) rqàð5la,} ""u-píšla t-ámr6t xlùl5le táma.} ‘They danced and you could
       say that (= it seemed that) there was a wedding there.’ (A35:7)

       dabêšwa,} kúlla t-amrètte dabèšwa xá kèpa yá'ni,} képa-w kêlša.} ‘After
       about ten days, you could say concerning it (= it seems) that it
       stuck together, you could say concerning it (= it seems) that the
       gypsum all stuck together in a single stone.’ (B5:185)15.1.5.3. Conditional Constructions
The b6d-qa†6l form is used in the apodosis of conditional sentences. In
the majority of cases it expresses an action that is temporally sequential
to a hypothetical situation in the future. As elsewhere the form should
be interpreted as perfective, expressing a complete action with start and
end point or an action that is at least delimited with a start point that is
sequential to the situation described in the protasis, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-háwe t-têrte ""aqlá°a,} ""ána b-zawnênne.} ‘If it were two legged, I
        would buy it.’ (A22:5)
  (2)   ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.} ‘If I were to have a daughter, I
        would give her to your son.’ (A25:8)
  (3)   ""6n-kpìnni,} t-axlênne.} ‘If I am hungry, I shall eat it.’ (A23:5)
  (4)   ""6n-š8r6† díyi q6m-y>ðêtla,} xo-b-gawrànnux.} ‘If you know (the answer
        to) my test, I shall indeed then marry you.’ (A25:62)
  (5)   ""6n-""amrènnux ""áp-""ati b-šàn6t.} ‘If I tell you, you will faint.’ (A11:2)
  (6)   ""6n-""ánna mt>m6mêtla,} ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘If you fulfil these (conditions),
        I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)
  (7)   ""6n-""axlíl6n š6kwáne t-axlìl6n.} ‘If the ants eat us, they shall eat us.’
        (A14:52)
602                              chapter fifteenIn some cases it expresses a future action that follows logically from a
given, real situation in the present denoted by the protasis clause, e.g.  (8) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila.} ‘If he is my nephew, he
      will come and he will know what these are.’ (A25:49)
  (9) ""6n-réš6t bábe díye ""ax-†ùra,} ""u-hóle q†íla l-T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi,} lˆka bt-
      áz6l?} ‘If the head of his father is like a mountain and he has been
      killed by T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi, where will he go?’ (A28:8)15.1.5.4. Discourse Dependency
In conditional constructions such as those illustrated in §15.1.5.3. the
action in the apodosis is presented from the viewpoint of the situation
in the protasis and always has a future reference relative to this view-
point. On some occasions the b6d-qa†6l form expresses dependency on a
preceding clause outside of conditional constructions. In such cases the
action in the b6d-qa†6l clause is not presented from the viewpoint of the
preceding clause and so does not necessarily have future time reference.
It may have present time reference. The form is perfective, delimited
either by a start and end point or at least by a start point that is sequen-
tial to what precedes. It may also express iterative aspect, but still should
be interpreted as perfective, in that it expresses one occurrence of an
event that is representative of the iterated situation. The b6d- prefix in
these constructions has lost the function of future temporal reference
but expresses only dependency. This dependency make take the form of
temporal sequentiality as in (1)–(5), e.g.  (1) ""èrbe máxe l-©ðàðe,} t-ázi xa-fàtra,} ""al-salíq6 zòrna.} máxe zórna xa-salíqa
      xèna,} ""èrbe b-dˆri,} b-ganèy.} ‘He gathers the sheep together and they go
      off for a while according to the tune of the pipe. He plays another
      tune on the pipe and the sheep return, by themselves.’ (A25:27)
  (2) ""u-zíl5le t-áz6l ""á°‰6t bàb6 d-5-bráta.} ‘He set off and went to the land
      of the girl’s father.’ (A29:34)
  (3) b-l7le qímla šárya b>núda dìya,} t-àza,} p°íxla t8ra qðìla.} ‘At night she

  (4) ""u-šuréle 'ajòze} yá'ni k‘àxa.} ""u-t-lá xàl6†} t-ám6r ya-""álaha šqùlli.} ‘He had
      started to get incapable and tired and, in order for him not to com-

       takes place. . . . Afterwards comes a small festival, which is called
       musarde.’ (B6:5–8)In some cases the b6d-qa†6l form does not express temporal sequentiality but
only some kind of relevance to a preceding clause. Consider (6) and (7):  (6) báw°6 Ninwàye} ""áp-""ay ""ìtwa.} ß5mìla.} t-ámri díge-w k°àye} ""áp ""an-zóre
      xtàye.} ‘The Rogation of the Ninevites was also observed (in our
      community). They would fast during it. They would say “The cocks
      and the chickens, and also the small lowly creatues (should observe
      the fast).” ’ (B16:15)
  (7) ""ána háw6n Qára Tè≥din,} ma°yán6t xárje-w bárj6t bo†anàye.} t-á°e xa-""árxa
      ""ax-d-àwwa} gu-bˆ°i} ""u-pál6† l7ð6n lˆk5le zála,} l7ka là!} ‘I am Qara
      Te≥din, the collector of all taxes of the people of Botan, and a
      guest comes like this into my house and leaves without me knowing
      where on earth he was going!’ (A26:34)In (6) the clause introduced by the verb t-ámri consitutes an elaboration
of the preceding statement that people would hold a fast, which could
be paraphrased ‘with regard to this fasting they say. . . .’ In (7) the b6d-qa†6l
form verb t-á°e denotes an action that is to be interpreted in the context
of the speaker having a high social position, which is expressed by the
statement ‘I am Qara Te≥din, the collector of all taxes of the people of
Botan’. In (6) and (7) the b6d-qa†6l verbs do not express sequentiality but
nevertheless they are in some way dependent on what precedes. In (6)
it may be said that the clause with the b6d-qa†6l form introduces back-
ground to the preceding foreground, whereas in (7) the form introduces
a foregrounded statement that is to be interpreted against the preceding
background.
   The fact that the use of the b6d-qa†6l form may be motivated by the
broad property of relevance to what precedes implies that it could be
used anywhere within a section of discourse, since, in principle, all clauses
would be in some way relevant to what precedes. This is how we should
understand its use with the verb ""mr ‘to say’ within sections of expository
discourse such as (8) and (9), where they have habitual aspect:  (8) m-l5le mbàdla táma,} yá'ni mbarxìwa.} y-a°éwa qàša.} har-gu-bˆ°a} y-as‰íwale
      gnùna-w} yá'ni t-ámr6x mbarxìwale.} ‘In the early morning they would
      perform the blessing (of the wedding ceremony) there. A priest
604                             chapter fifteen        would come. In the house they would tie the band. We say “They
        blessed it.” ’ (B5:30)
  (9)   béna bálki ""o-nàša,} ""o-xêtna t-ámr6x,} ""o-""ùrza,} lè-y-awe táma.} ‘Perhaps
        the person, we say the groom, the man, was not there.’ (B5:18)These b6d-qa†6l forms of ""mr are used interchangeably with the ""i-qa†6l
form, e.g.  (10) y-atwíwa b-dawˆre,} ""7-ga b-dawˆre,} . . . koðênta y-amrèxxa.} ‘They would
       sit on mules, at that time (they sat) on mules, .. a koð6nta (‘female
       mule’) we call it.’ (B5:28)In (11) the b6d-qa†6l form is used in clauses that depend on what precedes
in that they have the status of non-restrictive relative clauses qualifying a
head noun in the first clauses. This is similar to the elaborative function
in (6) above:  (11) kút-naša gu-""Ón-Núne ""ítle xaqlà°a,} b-z>rèla} zrùta,} ""6n-t-awèdla bustàne,}
       ""6n-t-awèdle kù-mdi-t b8ye.} ‘Everybody in ""“n-Nune has fields, which
       he cultivates, or he makes into an orchard or whatever he wants.’
       (B4:2)15.1.5.5. Negation of b6d-qa†6l Forms
The negative particle cannot be combined with the b6d-qa†6l form. To
express the negative, the negated form of the qa†6l or ""i-qa†6l form is used,
viz. la-qa†6l or la-y-qa†6l respectively. As described in §8.9., there are various
phonetic variants of the la-y-qa†6l form, which exhibit various degrees of
contaction, viz. le-y-qa†6l, l5-qa†6l, e.g.  (1)   ""ána là-""a°6n mènnux.} †la-mò la-""á°6t mènni?} sí là-""a°6n mènnux ""ána.} ‘ “I
        shall not come with you.” “Why won’t you come with me?” “Go
        away, I shall not come with you.” ’ (A6:6)
  (2)   qázi t-awèdla †làlux,} lá-""aw6dla †làli.} ‘The judge will make a decision
        in your favour, he will not make it in my favour.’ (A6:8)
  (3)   lá masp6rèxl6x bi-zàwda.} ‘We shall not make you wait more.’
        (A4:41)
  (4)   lè-y-axlena.} ‘I shall not eat.’ (B5:35)
  (5)   ""ána m-axxa-húdxa lè-y-az6n.} ‘I shall not go beyond here.’ (A12:23)
  (6)   ""ána là-y-asq6n.} ‘I shall not go up.’ (A32:29)
                            the syntax of verbs                            605  (7) bas-lè-y-y6nna bná°i-ll5xu.} ‘But I shall not give my daughters to you.’
      (A12:17)The ""i-qa†6l form is used elsewhere to express imperfective habitual aspect.
As remarked above, however, the positive b6d-qa†6l form is intrinsically per-
fective. The explanation appears to be that the positive future perfective
form asserts that a specific action will take place at a particular point in
time whereas its negated form should properly be interpreted as express-
ing an enduring property of the subject referent rather than referring to
an event that is bound to a particular point in time. When a speaker says
t-axl6n ‘I shall eat’, he is asserting that there will be a particular point in
time when he will eat. When he says le-y-axl6n, on the other hand, the
sense is ‘I have the property of not eating’. The salience of the particu-
lar point in time of an action is diffused when it is negated to the extent
that an imperfective form is used. The use of the negated qa†6l form,
viz. la-qa†6l, should, likewise, be interpreted as expressing a non-punctual
habitual imperfective aspect.
   A parallel to this diffusion of the salient temporal punctuality of a perfec-
tive form by negation is found in the imperative. Imperative forms express
a more salient, immediate command than deontic qa†6l forms. Although
imperatives can be negated, there is a greater tendency for negated com-
mands to be expressed by qa†6l forms than is the case with positive com-
mands (for further details see §15.7.). In some NENA dialects, furthermore,
a negated command can only be expressed by a qa†6l form.15.1.6. b6d-qa†6lwa15.1.6.1. Conditional Constructions
The b6d-qa†6lwa form, with the past converter suffix -wa, is used in the
apodosis of conditional sentences that refer to a hypothetical condition in
the past, which was not fulfilled (1–2), or to a hypothetical condition in
the present or future, which the speaker assesses to be impossible to fulfil
(3–4). The verb form expresses an action that is temporally or logically
sequential to the situation expressed in the protasis. Since it is delimited
by a starting point that is sequential to what precedes, it is inherently
perfective, e.g.  (1) ""6n-mbaqrêtwa,} t-yawènwalux zùze,} bás là mbuqèrrux.} ‘If you had asked,
      I would have given you money, but you did not ask.’
606                           chapter fifteen  (2) ""6n-y>ðènwa manay-díye mòdiwa,} t-amrênwalux,} bas-là y>ð6…wa.} ‘If I had
      known what its meaning was, I would have told you, but I did not
      know.’
  (3) ""6n-maßênwa,} t-a°ênwa,} bás lè-y-maß6n.} ‘If I could, I would come, but
      I cannot.’
  (4) ""6n-hawètwa gu-""á°‰a dìyi,} kú-m6ndi b>yètwa t-yànwalux.} ‘If you were in
      my country, I would give you whatever you wanted.’ (A26:57)The form may also express iterative aspect. In this context the form can
still be interpreted as perfective in that the speaker uses the form that is
appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence of the iter-
ated situation, e.g.  (5) ""6n-maßènwa t-yawènwalux zúze kùt-yum,} t-yawênwalux,} bás le-y-maßênwa.}
      ‘If I had been able to give you money every day, I would have given
      it to you, but I could not.’
  (6) ""6n-maßènwa t-yawènwalux zúze kùt-yum,} t-yawênwalux,} bas le-y-màß6n.}
      ‘If I could give you money every day, I would give it to you, but I
      cannot.’15.1.6.2. Deontic Constructions
The b6d-qa†6lwa form is used in questions relating to counterfactual situa-
tions in the past. They are of a deontic nature, in that the speaker addresses
the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation (deontic necessity: ‘What
should I have done?’) or give permission (deontic possibility: ‘What could
I have done?’), e.g.  (1) ""ína m-ˆka} t-óð6nwale gèšra?} ‘But from where could I have made him
      a bridge?’ (A17:18)
  (2) gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘(Why) should I have been fin-
      ished off by your stupid club (literally: the club of your behind)?!’
      (A52:17)15.1.6.3. Discourse Dependency
The b6d-qa†6lwa form is used outside of conditional constructions in clauses
that are in some way dependent on the preceding discourse. In such cases
the verb always expresses an iterative action. Various types of discourse
dependency are attested in the text corpus. In (1) and (2) the b6d-qa†6lwa
verbs are temporally sequential to what precedes:

      would take all our vessels, we would take them all and put ash on
      them to clean them.’ (B16:7)Other types of dependency are exhibited by the verb forms in the fol-
lowing examples:  (3) qam-ßàwma} ""í° xošéb6 bnà°a.} bná°a kúlla bt-azíwa bˆ°a,} b-šaqlíwa ""ixála

      went home, took food from here and from there, then went to a

      ‘They sold the tree, as we say. His relatives would come and (one)
      said “Hey, everybody, who will buy the tree?” One relative of his
      would say “I shall buy it for ten” and they would receive ten dinars.
      Another would say “I shall buy it for fifteen” and they would receive
      fifteen.’ (B5:42)

      ‘We had the church of Saint George . . . The top of it was designed
      for war. People would enter into the church, (go up) on top of it,
      and they would see all places, when there was fighting.’ (B2:3)
  (6) lá-mß6xwa t-óð6xwa ‘ú-mdi qam-tàlga.} ma-t-y-a°éwa tàlga,} y-a°èwa,}
      lá-mßiwa ""àp-axxa pal†íwa.} t-attèxwa béna gu-bˆ°a.} ‘We could not do
      anything on account of the winter. So much snow fell that people
      could not go out even to here. We sat in the house.’ (B16:27)In (3) the clause containing the first b6d-qa†6lwa verb, bt-azíwa, opens a sec-
tion of discourse that elaborates on the preceding general statement that
608                            chapter fifteenthe festival of Girls’ Sunday took place. The dependency expressed by
the verbal form binds it semantically to what precedes signalling that the
description of the specific event in the clause is intended to be understood
as a component of the festival. This example also contains a subsequent
chain of b6d-qa†6lwa forms (b-šaqlíwa . . . t-azíwa . . . t-atwìwa . . . t-axlìwa,
b-šatìwa). The clauses containing these verbs are also elaborative of the
initial general statement. Most of them can also be interpreted as tem-
porally sequential to the clause immediately preceding it. The semantic
dependency in these clauses consists of both the relation of specific to
general and also temporal sequence.
   Example (4) is similar to (3). The first b6d-qa†6lwa verb, t-a°7wa, occurs
in a clause at the onset of a section of discourse that describes the spe-
cific events of the general event of selling the tree. The discourse depen-
dency, therefore, is the relationship of specific to general. The subsequent
b6d-qa†6lwa verbs (t-ám6rwa . . . t-ám6rwa) are, likewise, specifying this general
event, but also are temporally sequential to what immediately precedes
them.
   The clause containing the b6d-qa†6lwa verb in (5) occurs at the onset
of a section that elaborates on the preceding statement concerning the
roof of the church.
   The relationship of the verb t-attèxwa in (6) to what precedes is one of
effect to cause, i.e. people could not go out on account of the snow and
for this reason we sat in the house.","[637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647]"

                3.3. The Origin of Consonant Gemination3.3.1. Gemination Inherited from Earlier Aramaic
Gemination inherited from morphological patterns of earlier Aramaic is
preserved in various words. This is the case when the geminate consonant
is preceded by the short vowel /6/ in a stressed syllable, e.g.     l•bba                ‘heart’
     q•nna                ‘nest’
     ""•zza                ‘nanny-goat’In some words it is preserved after /6/ also in unstressed syllables, e.g.     d6bbóra              ‘hornet’                 cf. Syr. debbòrtà
     s6mmála              ‘bundle’                 cf. Syr. semmàlàIn other words, however, it is normally weakened in this context, e.g.     gezara               ‘carrot’                 cf. Syr. gezzàrà
     lišana               ‘tongue’                 cf. Syr. leššànàThe distribution of gemination in these patterns, therefore, has become
largely lexicalized.
   The original gemination has usually been weakened after an original
/a/ or /u/ in both stressed and unstressed syllables, e.g.     káka                 ‘tooth’                  < *kakkà
     xabúša               ‘apple’                  < *˙abbùšà
     basíma               ‘pleasant’               < *bassìmà
     mšadóre              ‘to send’                < *mšaddòrè
     gúda                 ‘wall’                   < *guddà
     buqára               ‘question’               < *buqqàrà
     mšul•xle             ‘he stripped’            < *mšulláx-lèh
                          consonant gemination                           99There are some exceptions to this principle. The consonant /r/, for
example, tends to preserve vestiges of gemination in contexts where it is
lost in other consonants. This is the case, for example, in some nominal
patterns with an originally geminated medial radical, such as *CaCCùCà,
*CaCCùCtà and *CaCCàCtà, in which /r/ is often heard geminate, though
in free variation with non-geminate forms. The gemination is regularly
lost, by contrast, in other consonants, e.g.     garruwa ~ garuwa                 ‘pile of twigs’
     garruta ~ garuta                 ‘small pile of twigs’
     parrušta ~ parušta               ‘smooth pebble’
     qarraßta ~ qaraßta               ‘crowbar’
     †arraša ~ †araša                 ‘bush’Contrast:     xabuša               ‘apple’                   < *˙abbùšà
     tanura               ‘oven’                    < *tannùrà
     šabuqta              ‘wooden rod’              < *šabbùqtà
     nasarta              ‘saw’                     < *nassàrtàIt should also be noted that words with an original geminate *r in the
historical pattern *CaCCà have emphatic /‰/, which is pronounced with
a longer trill than non-emphatic /r/, e.g.     ma‰a                 ‘spade’                   < *marra
     pa‰a                 ‘lamb’                    < *parràGemination of other consonants is occasionally heard after /a/ in words
deriving from the historical patterns *CaCCàCà and CaCCìCà, e.g.     gabbara              ‘hero’
     †annaxa              ‘miller’
     bannaya              ‘builder’
     qaddiša              ‘saint’In some cases these may have been influenced by literary Syriac or by
loans from Arabic with the same pattern that preserve the gemination,
e.g. ˙addada ‘blacksmith’, fassada ‘corrupt person’. In the words of Aramaic
100                             chapter threestock, however, the forms with gemination are generally used in free varia-
tion with forms that lack it, e.g. bannaya ~ banaya ‘builder’.
    Gemination occurs after /u/ in the word pumma ‘mouth’. Here the
explanation seems to be that the /u/ has developed from an original *6
under the influence of the following labial.
    Gemination is preserved after /a/ in the word xašša ‘sadness’ < *˙aššà
and its derivative xaššana ‘sad’ and also in the word šmayya ‘heaven’. This
may be due to the association of these words with the language of the
liturgy and so could be explained as due to the influence of literary
Syriac.
    Note also the preservation of the geminated /m/ in the numeral xamm6š
‘five’ (f.) < *˙amm6š.","[137, 138, 139]"
"15.11.1. Extension
Under this head can be included various uses of the particle to express
the extension and continuity of a situation.
  The particle can be used as an intensifier to underscore the enduring
nature of a situation, e.g.  (1)   har-d6bbóre zál5la-w °áya dúrr dúrr dùrr.} ‘The hornets constantly flew
        back and forth.’ (A20:6)
  (2)   har-bxàya-wawa.} ‘They were constantly crying.’ (A25:5)

        (A15:21)
  (4)   ""u-""áti har-háw6t baràye} ""u-sápr6t ku-t-á°e làxxa.} ‘You be outside all the

  (5)   har-blíg6t b-kàsux.} ‘You are always busy with your stomach.’ (A23:10)
  (6)   har-xwàrta wáwa.} ‘It was always white.’ (A4:36)It occurs in this sense in clauses in which the copula is omitted, e.g.  (7)   ""u-là-mßal5wa qa-""álaha.} har-dbíše b-bronèy.} ‘They did not pray to
        God. They were constantly attached to their son.’ (A15:17)
  (8)   ""a-d-áy á¬áy6lla kùlle míya} ""a-d-áw har-áê¬ya.} ‘She fills hers all with
        water. His was constantly full.’ (A17:25)It may be combined with verbs denoting habitual or iterative activities
to express an intensified frequency. The verb is either in the ( ""i-)qa†6l or
wele q†ala form, e.g.  (9)  ""ánna-t ""árxe har-y-oðíwa nùra gu-b7°a.} ‘People who had mills would
       always make a fire in the house.’ (A19:4)
  (10) xèlma náša hár ""i-xàze.} ‘People always dream.’ (A4:7)
  (11) ""u-""áyya har-šaqláwa m6n-d-àn šíše} mattàwa} ""èlla dìya} hál ""7-g6t q6m-
       qa†làla.} ‘She (the daughter-in-law) was constantly taking the iron
       bars and putting them into her, until she killed her.’ (A19:6)
  (12) kazíwa prám6lla har-pal†ìwa.} ‘They tried to cut them down, but they
       kept growing up.’ (A38:15)
  (13) har-wéla taq-táq mxàya} ""u-taq-tàq,} xá-bena-w trè,} w-áwwa sqìdle.} ‘They
       continually made a taq-taq knocking noise, taq-taq, once, then
       twice, then he became fed up.’ (A14:68)When used with a verb expressing a non-iterative perfective action, it
expresses the sense of repetition of the action and can usually be trans-
lated ‘again’, e.g.  (14) yóm6t †¬à°a} har-ßlèla.} ‘On the third day she went down again.’
       (A22:18)
  (15) ""6n-lì° biš-zlíme mènn6n,} har-t-àz6x.} ‘If there are none more wronged
       than us, we shall again go (on our way).’ (A13:9)

tence of a situation in contexts where there is typically some expectation
that the situation would not persist. The clause either contains a copula
or a compound infinitive verbal form, which expresses action in progress,
e.g.  (16) har-xà°ila.} ‘She is still my sister.’ (A18:27)
  (17) ""u-d6bbóre hár-hola qam-t8r6t bòya.} ‘The hornets were still before the
       door of the hole.’ (A20:9)
  (18) hár-dwaq6t rêqqi?} ‘Do you still insist (on what you said)?’ (A40:4)When, however, the clause contains one of the set of verbs denoting
mental processes which express the progressive by the qa†6l form rather
than the compound infinitive form (§15.1.1.4.), the verb is generally put
in the ""i-qa†6l form, e.g.  (19) har-xá°e ""i-b9yela.} ‘He still loves his sister.’ (A18:16)In this sense the particle may be used together with a verb negated by la or
the negative copula. The final /r/ sometimes shifts to /l/ by assimilation to
the initial /l/ of the negator, e.g. hal-la (< har-la), hal-l5le (< har-l5le), e.g.  (20) ""áy har-là-yaw6lla.} ‘It still does not give it back.’ (A34:4)
  (21) hal-lˆla gláya.} ‘She (the mother) still does not reveal (the truth).’
       (A38:6)It occurs with this sense in clauses from which the copula has been elided,
e.g.  (22) har-m-r6š-gàre,} mêra} ‘While still on the roof, she said . . .’ (A26:75)
  (23) bén6 †è¬¬6° mòdi wídle?} hár mdagòle gu-má°a,} ""áwwa hàtx5le wíða-w} ""áwwa
       hàtx5le míra-w} ""áwwa hàtx5le,} dráya búxt6n l-xá l-d-o-xèna} ‘What did
       he do the third time? He continued to tell lies in the village “He
       did such-and-such. He said such-and-such,” slandering this one
       and that one.’ (A48:5)The particle is used with a perfective verb as an intensifier to underscore
sequentiality. It expresses the occurrence of an action that may not
be expected to occur in sequence to what precedes. In most cases it is
764                               chapter fifteenappropriate to translate the particle in such contexts by ‘still’ (in a logical
sense) or ‘nevertheless’, e.g.  (24) k6mêt t-árqena} tópe har-†apyàli.} ‘However much I run, a gun will still
       reach me.’ (B9:3)
  (25) mqáwl6t goràtle,} t-yálla jùlla.} ""6n-là,} har-t-yálla júll6x b-kèf6x.} ‘If you
       promise to marry him, he will give back the clothes. If not, he
       will still give you the clothes, if you want them.’ (A14:83)
  (26) málka ""áti har-t-yàtli brátux?} ‘King, will you still give me your daugh-
       ter?’ (A25:24)
  (27) mère hár t-azèna.} mère hár t-azèt?} mère hˆ!} ‘He said “I’ll still go.” He
       said “Will you still go?” He said “Yes!” ’ (A8:45)
  (28) ""áwwa q†ílle xmàre,} ""u-q†ílle sùsa,} q†ílle tàwra,} ""ánna kúlla q†ilìle,} har-mère
       ma-yxàl6f.} ‘He had killed the asses, killed the horse, killed the ox.
       He had killed them all. He (the uncle) still said “That is all right.” ’
       (A23:31)It may be used with a negated verb with a similar function, e.g.  (29) har-là-wela rázi.} ‘She was still not satisfied.’ (A30:34)
  (30) k6má-gay6x tíwe m-©ðàðe,} har-lán mêßya ""axwá°e dìye.} ‘However many
       times we have sat together, I still have not been able to be like
       him.’ (A25:44)
  (31) hal-la xzeli ""u-hal-la swili. ‘I, nevertheless, have not found (anybody)
       and I, nevertheless, have not been satisfied.’ (C3:8)On some occasions har is replaced by the particle hala, which is attested
in a few cases in the text corpus before a negative copula or negative
existential particle, e.g.  (32) síq5le gu-réš6t ""Amedìya,} ""ìna} núr6t xàle} t-íwa síqa l-tàma} gu-zòma} hála
       lˆle óèmya.} ‘He went up to the top of Amedia and saw that the fire
       in the summer house of his maternal uncle, where he was making
       for, had still not gone out.’ (A25:40)
  (33) ""áwwa nàša} hála lìtwale.} ‘This man still did not yet have (a son).’

Under this head can be included the use of har to express temporal imme-
diacy of sequence, as in (1)–(4), in which it is combined with a perfective
verb with the sense of ‘as soon as’, e.g.  (1)   har-ðìl5xu príql6n m6n-†úra,} d7r6n tòpe,} kút-xa maxèla} xánj6r dìye,} ""o-t-íle
        qáme díye qa†êlle.} ‘As soon as you know that we have finished (com-
        ing over) the mountain, I shall fire a gun and everyone will strike
        with his dagger and kill the man in front of him.’ (B19:6)
  (2)   har-wéla dán6t kawù°ra,} xzélux xa-náša °àya,} málla bt-à°e,} t-áw6r
        gu-bˆ°a} yá'ni xamšá daqíqela hal-""êßra} ""áti ""à°eti.} ‘As soon as lunchtime
        has come and you have seen a man coming—the mullah will come
        and enter the house—after five or ten minutes you come back.’
        (A22:22)
  (3)   har-qítla bìyux,} qa†lílux t-axlìlux.} ‘As soon as they hit you, they will
        kill you and eat you.’ (A22:39)
  (4)   ""u-hadíya brát6t màlka} har-xázya ""áxni zmára-w rqàða} ""áy jal-jálde t-ásqa
        l-gàre.} ‘Now, as soon as the daughter of the king sees that we
        are singing and dancing, she will quickly come up to the roof.’
        (A27:28)Another form of temporal immediacy is illustrated in (5), in which the
particle has the sense of ‘directly’:  (5)   har-""è°y5le m6n-†úra réša-reša d-o-gàre.} ‘He came directly from the
        mountain onto the roof.’ (A23:14)The particle may be used to express some kind of narrowing of the extent
of action. In such cases it is usually appropriate to translate it ‘just’, e.g.  (6)  ""ína bróna lˆla xílt6lle.} har-nobált6lle mutt7°6lle mattòye.} ‘She did not eat
       the boy. She just took him and put him down.’ (A19:7)
  (7) ""ána har-ßál6n mðìta} m7°6n ""ixàla} ""u-""à°ena.} ‘I’ll just go down to the

       look (literally: take a smell of it), perhaps I shall find a brother of
       mine, my sister, a relative or mine.’ (A18:16)
  (9) har-sa-xúpla ""áti b-gàn6x!} ‘Just go and wash her yourself !’ (A27:25)
  (10) har-šúqla tàma.} ‘Just leave alone over there.’ (A25:53)
766                            chapter fifteenAlso under the head of ‘narrowing’ can be included the function of har
to act as an intensifier of an assertion, e.g.  (11) xà-yoma,} har-mítle b6-duzù°a.} ‘One day he indeed really died.’
       (A27:42)
  (12) b-álaha hóle xa-púrya láxxa zòra} ""áw har-xá-mdi ""ìle.} ‘By God, there is
       a small chink of light here. It is surely something.’ (A14:25)
  (13) har-xá-m6ndi ""ì° b-áyya dúk°a t-íle wìra.} ‘There must surely be some-
       thing in this place where it entered.’ (A11:9)
  (14) ""áxni har-xòn6n-it.} ‘You are indeed our brother.’ (A39:12)
  (15) g8r6g ""àmr6x.} ""ay-xá-yoma har-t-y9ða} t-íle mí°a bròn6n.} ‘We must
       tell (her). She will surely know one day that our son is dead.’
       (A4:38–39)
  (16) ya-""àlahi.} xúya har-xùy5le.} har-déwe t-axlìli.} har-t-áz6n gu-d-ànna
       hambišáye} har-hambišàye-≥i t-axlíli.} ‘My God, it is very dark, either
       wolves are sure to eat me or I shall go to these giants and the
       giants are sure to eat me.’ (A39:4)
  (17) mère ""ána zála har-zíl6n bìya.} ‘I’m indeed finished!’ (A14:25)It is used also to intensify a negated assertion (18) and a prohibition (19),
e.g.  (18) har-là-mß6n t-amrènnux.} ‘I cannot tell you.’ (A11:2)
  (19) har-la-šqúlla biš-spày.} ‘Do not take it off, it is better.’ (A39:14)
        15.12. The Distribution of the Long Endings of VerbsVarious long endings of verbs are optionally used for the first person sin-
gular and plural and second person singular inflections of qa†6l base forms
that do not have further suffixes attached (§8.2.1.). An examination of their
distribution in the text corpus shows that these long verbal inflections are
conditioned by the position of their occurrence in the intonation group. In
the vast majority of cases they occur at the end of the intonation group,
immediately before the group boundary. They should, therefore, be con-
sidered to be a type of prosodic pausal form. They, moreover, normally
take the nuclear stress. Examples:  (1)   b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""íman mˆ°ena.} ‘I want to know when I shall die.’
        (A16:1)
                            the syntax of verbs                             767  (2)   ""u-xètna l-b7°a pˆšena.} ‘And I shall become a son-in-law in the
        house.’ (A17:35)
  (3)   ""ána bt-àzena.} ‘I shall go.’ (A25:32)
  (4)   mó ""amràna?} ‘What should I say?’ (A26:33)
  (5)   dán5la jàwjexi.} ‘It is time for us to move.’ (A30:44)
  (6)   t-áz6t ""askarìya,} láz6m ""àzeti.} ‘You have to go to the army, you must
        go.’ (A17:22)
  (7)   xàr°a,} pàl†eti} ""ap-""aßèrta hàd6x.} ""u-""áti har-háw6t baràye} ""u-sápr6t
        ku-t-á°e làxxa.} m-bá°6r xámša daqìqe} ""áti ""àwreti.} ‘Then, you go
        out, and in the evening (do) the same. You be outside all the time
        and wait for whoever comes here. After five minutes you should
        come in.’ (A22:23)
  (8)   xzí gàw‰a,} xzi-maßì°eti.} ‘Look husband, look listen!’ (A22:15)
  (9)   ""áp-""ati sì} pàlxeti.} ‘You also go and work.’ (A23:2)Another factor that conditions the use of a long inflectional form is dis-
course structure, in that the heavy morphology of a long form is some-
times used to mark a boundary of a discourse section. This is seen in
(10), where the narrator repeats a key statement of the protagonist. The
second version of the statement differs from the first in the use of the
long form mˆ°ena in place of the short form m7°6n. Both occur at the end
of the intonation group. The motivation to use the long form appears to
be to mark the end of the section of speech:  (10) mère b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""ìman m7°6n.} mère b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""íman
       mˆ°ena.} ‘He said “I want to know when I shall die.” He said “I
       want to know when I shall die.” ’ (A16:1)This can be seen also in (11), in which the verbal phrase ‘you obey me’
occurs three times, in two instances of which at an intonation group
boundary. The long form, however, is used in only one of these instances.
This coincides with a discourse boundary in that it occurs at the end of
a conditional construction. The short form before an intonation group
boundary, however, does not coincide with such a discourse boundary,
but rather at the end of a protasis, which requires completion by the
following clause:  (11) ""6n-""àti} mášm6t ""êlli} maš6myàti.} ""6n-là mašèmy6t,} sá m7°5le xòn6x} ""u-
       xza-""ˆk5le.} ‘If you (want to) obey me, obey me. If you do not obey
       me, go and bring your brother and find where he is (yourself ).’
       (A8:64)
768                           chapter fifteenIn the exceptional cases where the long inflection does not occur at the
intonation group boundary, discourse structure appears to be the primary
motivation for the use of the long form, in that it occurs in a clause that
closes a section of discourse. This is the case in (12), in which the clause
in question occurs at the end of a section of speech:  (12) šuréla mjawóde m-©ðàðe} ""7ni nábl6x k6s-d-ˆni.} Zìne nábl6x k6s-M8mo}
       lo-M9mo nábl6x k6s-Zíne.} mèra là,} bàxta} be-b9x6t-ila.} maq6†làle gáw‰a}
       nabléxi Zìne k6s-M8mo.} ‘They started arguing with one another
       regarding whom to take to whom. “Should we take Zine to M>mo
       or M>mo to Zine?’ They said “No, a woman is treacherous.
       She will have her husband killed. Let us take Zine to M>mo.” ’
       (A26:2)The long inflection is virtually without exception avoided in the first of
a series of two or more verbs in a single intonation group. This applies
both to cases where a verb is followed by a complement clause and also
to sequential series of verbs, e.g.  (13) ""ána ""àxxa b8y6n z>réna.} ‘I want to plough here.’ (A30:8)
  (14) ""áxni †la-mò ßál6x ""áxni mpal†èxle?} ‘Why should we go down and
       release him?’ (A26:77)
  (15) q7m6n torênn5y.} ‘I’ll get up and break them up.’ (A30:22)The optional long form of the 1pl. L-suffix -l5ni, which marks the pro-
nominal subject of the q†ille form, or a pronominal object, exhibits a
similar pattern of distribution. It is predominantly used at the end of an
intonation group, e.g.  (16) kúlla xaràye,} t6xrù°i,} plìl5ni.} ‘In the end, I remember, we separated.’
       (B8:9)
  (17) ""áwwa b-tayêml5ni.} ‘He will finish us off.’ (A30:41)
  (18) hóla xzáy6ll6n qá†u ráqa bá°r6n xàl6ll5ni.} ‘The cat sees us, runs after
       us and eats us.’ (A44:1)
  (19) sparègle ""ìtl5ni.} ‘We have quinces.’ (B5:218)
  (20) ßl>wá°a kúlla mal6pwalˆni.} ‘He taught us all the prayers.’ (B8:16)The exceptional occurrences of the long form before the end of the into-
nation group often occur in clauses that mark the boundary of a section
                              the syntax of verbs                                 769of discourse. In (21), for example, the long form occurs in a clause that
constitutes the opening of a section of discourse concerning Christmas:  (21) xàr°a} y-a°él5ni ""èða} ""éð6t be-yàlda.} ‘Then we have (another) festival,
       the festival of Christmas.’ (B6:12)The 3pl. L-suffix has short forms with monophthong (-la, -l5) and long
forms with a diphthong (-ley, -lay). The long forms with a diphthong exhibit
a similar pattern of distribution to that of other long suffixes and can be
considered to be prosodic pausal forms. They are attested predominantly
at the end of an intonation group, e.g.  (22) npílela-w néra nùb6lley.} ‘They fell and the river carried them
       away.’ (B3:9)
  (23) ""7-g6 °èley,} zílla l-d-7-ma°6 qurðàye.} ‘When they came back, they
       went to that village of Kurds.’ (B3:14)
  (24) ""u-políse xzéla ""an-yále jwànqe,} q6m-mattíla b-sandùqe,} q6m-hawíla xá‘‘a
       ""ixàla-w} q6m-x>ðíla hátxa t-la-q5ralèy} ""u-q6m-d5r7la gu-mìya.} ‘The
       policemen found the two beautiful children, put them in a chest,
       gave them some food, wrapped them up, like this, so that they
       would not be cold, and put them in the water.’ (A8:12)Exceptional cases often occur in clauses that mark the boundary of a sec-
tion of discourse. In (25), for example, it occurs at the end of an episodic
section in a narrative:  (25) fa-qímla šqílla ganèy.} daw7r6 diyèy} nál6t ""áql6 dawˆra} prìzl5le.} q6m-mattíla
       b6-l-'9k6s.} q6m-""as‰ìla.} ""u-plí†ley m6n-tàma.} ‘So, they took themselves
       off. Their mules—the shoe of their mules’ feet was made of iron.
       They put it on backwards. They tied them (the shoes) on and set
       off from there.’ (B3:15–16)It should be noted that this distribution of the long form of the 3pl. L-suffix
differs from that of the long, diphthongal variants of the 3pl. suffix that
is attached to nouns, which are used more regularly. One reason may be
that the short form of the latter -a is identical with the singular nominal
ending -a. It tends to be used mainly in contexts where the attribution
of the noun to the 3pl. referent is highly predictable, such as inalienable
possessions of the subject (see §14.5.1.).
770                           chapter fifteen   15.13. The Expression of the Direct Object of Verbal Forms15.13.1. Pronominal Direct Object
The expression of the pronominal object on the various verb forms has
been described in §8.19. We may recap here as follows. The direct pro-
nominal object on verb forms derived from the present and imperative
bases is expressed by L-series suffixes. These suffixes derive historically
from phrases consisting of the preposition l-, used in this context as an
object marker, and the pronominal suffix, e.g.      qa†lále   ‘She kills him’
      qa†láli   ‘She kills me’
      q†úlle    ‘Kill (sing.) him!’
      q†úlule   ‘Kill (pl.) him!’When the pronominal object is 3rd person, it may be expressed by the
inflection of the past base: q†il- (ms.), q†ila- (fs.), q†ili- (pl.), e.g.      q†ílle    ‘He killed him’
      q†ilále   ‘He killed her’
      q†ilíle   ‘He killed them’In practice, the form q†ílle with the incorporated 3ms. object, tends to be
avoided. Most examples in the text corpus of pronominal objects incor-
porated into the past base are 3fs. and 3pl. objects, e.g.  (1) muttále xàß-súsa bá°re dìye.} ‘He put her on the back of the horse
      behind him.’ (A29:37)
  (2) la-x6zyàli.} ‘I did not see her.’ (A26:11)
  (3) qímle šqilìle.} muttìle} r6š-d-5-""ˆna.} ‘He took them and put them on top
      of the spring.’ (A15:1)
  (4) m5d6‰ìlux.} ‘You have brought them back.’ (A17:14)When the pronominal object is 3ms, the functionally equivalent q6m-qa†6l
form with an object L-suffix tends to be used, e.g.  (5) q6m-dawqàle.} ‘She took hold of him.’ (A22:19)
  (6) q6m-†arèdle °éle zìlle} be-""ámte dìye.} ‘He drove him away and he went
      back to his aunt’s house.’ (A23:33)
                           the syntax of verbs                          771The q†ille form with an incorporated 3ms. object tends to be used in
clauses that are closely connected to the preceding clause. In such contexts
pronominal objects sometimes have zero realization in other verbal forms
(see examples 8–17 below), so this may also be the case here. In (7), for
example, the clause in question is an elaboration of the previous clause
and does not advance the discourse:  (7) nìxl6n m-’úxo,} drél6n l-Zàwa.} ‘We have got rid of ’uxo. We’ve put
      him in the Zab.’ (A7:19)The q6m-qa†6l form with an L-suffix is also used as an optional alternative
to q†ille to express a 3fs. and 3pl. pronominal object and as an obliga-
tory suppletive form of q†ille to express 1st or 2nd person pronominal
objects.
   Compound verbal forms consisting of a resultative participle or an infini-
tive express a pronominal object either by L-suffixes or by a pronominal
suffix attached to the preposition ""6ll-. The latter is obligatory when the
participle or infinitive does not have a copula enclitic, e.g.     hóle q†íl6lle
     y-áwe q†íl6lleIf the there is a copula enclitic, the most common means of expressing
the pronominal object is by L-suffixes. The use of the longer ""6ll- phrase
produces a heavier morphological form with a greater number of syllables.
When the copula enclitic is 3rd person, the ""6ll- phrase is generally placed
before the copula, e.g.","[800, 801, 802, 803, 804, 805, 806, 807, 808, 809, 810]"
"In some cases the placement of the connective on a clause that is not
final in a sequential chain reflects the fact that the action of the clause
with the connective is felt to cohere closely with that of the following
clause to the extent that the two express a single seamless event. This
composite event, therefore, is the final event of the chain. It is relevant
to note that such composite events generally occur in the same intonation
group, which is a prosodic signal of coherence (§18.3.). They are often
introduced by verbs of movement, such ‘to come’, ‘to go’, ‘to take away’, as
in the following:  (18) b-l7le qímla šárya b>núda dìya,} t-àza,} p°íxla t8ra qðìla.} zílla xílla xà-yala
       xéna} ""u-°éla dmìxla.} ‘At night she got up, untied her bands, then
       went and opened the door with a key, went, ate another child and
       came back and went to sleep.’ (A18:3)
  (19) ßàl6x,} zawn•xl6n k°ayà°a-w} t-á°6x bašl•xla b-gàn6n.} ‘Let’s go down,
       buy for ourselves some chickens and come back and cook them
       ourselves.’ (A2:2)
  (20) ja-jálde qìm5le} ""u-zíla šqíl6lle ""o-q7sa rìxa.} ‘He quickly got up and went
       and took the long stick.’ (A22:27)
  (21) šqíl6lla †ása b-lˆle} ""u-núbl6lla z•dy6lla gu-ða-dˆrta.} ‘They took the bowl
       in the night and carried it away and threw it into a house enclo-
       sure.’ (A15:11)In general it may be said that the use of the connective particle constitutes
heavy morphological coding of the semantic connection, in contrast to the
light coding of asyndesis. This heavy coding is used at the end of sequences
as end weighting to mark closure. Related to this function of halting a
sequence, is its function of marking a lack of sequence between clauses.
In (22) and (23), for example, events that take place simultaneously with
the one preceding it are linked in each case by the connective particle:  (22) ""áti tú-tiwa làxxa.} ""u-súsi páy6š làxxa} ""u-""ána bráta masq•nna be-bába
       dìya.} ‘You stay here and my horse will stay here and I shall take
       the girl up to the house of her father.’ (A29:41)
914                             chapter eighteen  (23) dmíx5le Dáwið kóra làxxa} ""u-báxta dmíxt5la làxxa} ""u-""o-rább6n dmíx5le
       làxxa.} ‘Blind David slept here, the woman slept here and the monk
       slept here.’ (A16:9)One may say that these passages express a slowing of the temporal line
and so are more static than dynamic temporal sequences. Sometimes
a series of clauses that express temporally sequential events are linked
together by a repeated use of the connective particle. This is typically
found in passages that do not belong to the main foreground of the nar-
rative and do not crucially advance the narrative line. It can be regarded,
therefore, as a strategy to express the slowing down of the progress of
the narrative, e.g.  (24) xílela xa-ràmša} ""u-prìqela,} ""u-d•ry6lle šwì°a.} ‘They ate dinner and
       finished (the meal), then they (each) laid out a bed.’ (A16:9)
  (25) q7mi ßáli zoníla t6rté-k°aye ""u-m5°ˆla-w} mattíla gu-qußárta mbašlìla-w}
       ""u-yátwi ""àxli.} ‘They go down and buy two chickens and bring them
       back. They put them in a pan and cook them, then sit down to
       eat them.’ (A2:3)
  (26) tíwela tàma.} ""u-xílela ""ixàla} ""u-píše dmìxe.} ‘They sat there and they
       ate food and they stayed to sleep.’ (A15:7–8)The narrator sometimes slows down the action expressed by verbs of
movement by repeating the verb. The connective particle is often used
to assist in this strategy, spinning out the action as it were. In (27), for
example, the repeated series of the verb siqla ‘she went up’ has the effect
of expressing gradual movement:  (27) ""u-sìqla-w} ""u-sìqla-w}""u-sìqla-w} ""u-sìqla-w} ""7-ga t-ìla-qriwta ""•lla} . . . ‘She
       (gradually) came up and up and up and up. When she was near
       to her . . .’ (A4:17)Similar constructions are used to express long journeys, which take a long
time to complete, e.g.  (28) °éla b-""ùrxa-w} °éla-w °éla-w °éla-w °èla.} tre-†¬á yománe wéla b-""úrxa
       t-là-xala,} ""u-t-là-štaya.} ‘He came on the road. He came and came
       and came and came. He was on the road for two or three days,
       without food and without drink.’ (A26:16)
  (29) zílla b-šaqí°a, zílla-w zílla-w zìlla.} ‘They went along in the stream,
       they went and went and went.’ (A8:12)
                               clause sequences                                  915  (30) xíšla-w xíšla-w xìšla,} †êryela gu-yáma.} ‘They travelled and travelled
       and travelled, they sailed on the sea.’ (A14:38)In passages describing a habitual situation speakers often join clauses or
groups of clauses together with the connective particle when they do not
intend these as sequential activities but rather as various aspects of the
situation that come to mind, e.g.  (31) m•dre d5r7wa ""8raq †la-xlùla,} sab-xlúla rába náše ‘5dìwa.} ""u-m5°7wa ""•rwe
       p5rmíwa y-oðíwa qàlya.} ""u-m5°7wa r•zza ""u-m6ndyàne} béna hál-yom6t
       xlùla.} ‘They would put aside arak for the wedding, since many
       people were invited. They would bring sheep, slaughter them and
       make qalya. They would bring rice and other things (and continue
       thus) until the day of the wedding.’ (B5:23)
  (32) y-oð•xwa lèbe-u,} gaxkêxwa-w} zamrêxwa-w} xaml•xwa bìya.} ""u-y-amrêxwa:}
       d6-xùlena-w} y-ám6r l5n-kpìna-w} xêðya-w} m-án m6ndiyàne.} ‘We would make
       tricks, laughed, sang and enjoyed the occasion. We would say “Eat!”
       and he would say “I am not hungry”, in fun, things like that.’ (B5:33)Repetition of a clause given ballast by the particle may be used to present
its content with added prominence, e.g.  (33) léš-""a°6x hayorêxlux} ""u-b7°ux xoš-""àq6ð} ""u-xoš-""àq6ð.} ‘We shall not come
       to help you any more. Let your house burn! Let it burn!’ (A48:6)Likewise the motivation to use the connective before the negated clauses
in (34) appears to be to enhance the force of the denial:  (34) ""ána skínta matt•nna l-qðàli} ""u-lá matt•nna l-qðàl6x.} réši parmênne} ""u-réš6x
       là parm•nne.} ‘I shall put the knife to my neck, I shall not put it to
       your neck! I shall cut off my head, I shall not cut off your head!’
       (A14:35)The heavy coding of the connective particle is sometimes used to mark
the onset of the main narrative section of a story after the preliminary
background section, e.g.  (35) ""í°wa xa-málka t-Y9man.} ""ítwale xa-bròna} y>kàna-wewa.} ""u-qíme ""áw
       ""u-bròn-díye ""u-tre-w>zíre plí†e ßˆda.} ‘There was a king of Yemen. He
       had a son who was an only child. He and his son together with
       two ministers went out hunting.’ (A14:36)
916                              chapter eighteenThe connective particle is used to link a clause expressing an event and
one that expresses a temporally overlapping state or ongoing activity.  (36) qídle b7°6t duglàna-w} ""áxni là-ðiye bíye.} ‘The house of the liar has
       burnt down, while we did not know about it.’ (A48:7)
  (37) n•mo ""í° xa-náša máße táw6r réš6t Zálo ""u-Rust8mo sàxi?} ‘Is there somebody
       who can break the head of Zàl while Rustam is alive?’ (A29:11)
  (38) w-ána q6m-maxˆli} w-áti xyára bìyi.} ‘But they beat me while you were
       looking at me.’ (A2:10)
  (39) ""aw-ráqa ""u-""aw-xéna šaq•lla xa-kílo dàwe m•nne díye,} máxe gu-réše dìye.}
       ‘While he was running, the other took a kilo of gold in his hands
       and hit him (with it) on his head.’ (A14:94)Note that in such stative or progressive clauses the copula is often omit-
ted. This reflects a degree of dependency on the event clause (§17.6.1.)
in that they have a function of an adverbial modifier.
   In (40–43) the temporally overlapping state clause has an adversative
or concessive sense, in that it is not the state that is expected to exist in
combination with the event in question:  (40) díya t-àm6r} ""áp ""anna-júlle t-ilà-llux} ""u-""áyya xmárta dìyila.} w-áti x•zy6tli ""ána
       tíwa l-xàßa.} ‘He will say now that also these clothes that are on you and
       this ass are mine, but you have seen that I was sitting on its back.’ (A6:12)
  (42) málka krìble} ""u-b-gáne málka mír5wa ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.}
       ‘The king became angry, although the king himself had said “If
       I have a daughter I shall give her to your son.” ’ (A25:8)
  (43) píšla d6≥mênne,} ""u-""áni là-x6zye ©ðáðe,} ""u-là-mßu°e hátxa m•ndi.} ‘So, they
       became enemies, although they had not met each other and had
       not said (to each other) any such a thing.’ (B19:2)The same applies to (44), in which the question ‘but what have I done?’
is functionally equivalent to ‘but I have done nothing (to deserve it)’:  (44) q6m-dar•tli gu-d-áwwa qùnya.} ""u-""ána mùn wíða?} ‘You have put me in
       this hole, but what have I done?’ (A14:23)Two co-ordinated copula clauses may be linked with the connective, e.g.  (45) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ‘A week
       for us is seven days and a month is thirty days.’ (A17:13)

       very clever and also his wife, whom he married, is very clever.’ (A17:21)
  (47) ""áw bròn-málka rába šapìr5le} ""u-hawnàn5le.} ‘That son of a king is very
       good-looking and is clever.’ (A4:3)A copula clause that expresses a comment on a preceding statement may
be introduced by the connective as in (48). This may be regarded as the
use of heavy coding to express closure:  (48) ""o-yál6t b>yàwale} hóle ""ê°ya-w} q6m-yaw•lla yalêx°a ""•lli.} ""u-""áyy5la kùlla.}
       ‘The young man whom she loved has come and has given me her
       scarf, and that is all.’ (A4:24)In a few cases the connective particle w expresses logical sequence, e.g.  (49) hadíya ""áti màlk6n-it} ""u-hál ""ámra t-óð6x xaðù°a.} ‘Now you are our king,
       so give us an order for us to celebrate.’ (A14:46)
  (50) b-šˆna °élux!} ""•dyo ""àrxiw6t} ""u-là-z>d6t.} ‘Welcome! Today you are my
       guest, so you should not be afraid.’ (A14:32)18.1.2. fa-
A few informants use the Arabic connective particle fa-. This, however,
is by no means an established feature of the dialect. It is entirely absent
in the speech of some informants. In the texts that contain this particle
it is used in the following ways.","[952, 953, 954, 955, 956]"
"14.9.11.2. Adverbial
The particle xena may be used adverbially with the sense of ‘more,
again’:  (1)   ""ána xéna šúla la-pàlx6n.} ‘I shall not work any more.’ (A23:40)
  (2)   xéna ‰ìš5le.} ‘He woke up again.’ (A14:95)
  (3)   xéna téla tèl5le.} ‘The fox was a fox again.’ (A32:26)When it occurs at the front of a clause, it is often largely devoid of semantic
content, serving, it seems, as a discourse particle expressing some kind of
boundary and prominence, e.g.
                          the syntax of nominals                           549  (4) xéna políse mù t-óði?} ‘Well, what should the police do?’ (A8:9)
  (5) xéna ""ána q7m6n ""áz6n ""ùmra.} ‘Well, I shall go to church.’ (A37:2)
  (6) xéna ßlì°5la.} ‘Well, she went down.’ (A4:37)14.9.11.3. Modifier of Quantifier
On some occasions the particle is placed after a quantifier:  (1) šqíl6nwa xá‘‘a xéna qàlya} ta-t-axlènne b-""ùrxa.} ‘I took a little more
      roasted meat to eat on the way.’ (A23:10)
  (2) ""6n-haw7tuwa dèry6lli xá‘‘a xéna biš-hód6x . . . ‘If you had thrown me a
      little further along . . .’ (A7:22)
  (3) xá‘‘a xéna mumžêlla.} ‘She delayed a little more.’ (A18:21)14.9.12. mo, mu, mut, modi
This interrogative particle, in its various forms, may be used as a modi-
fier of a noun, e.g.  (1) ""áwwa mò-t>h6r náš5le?} ‘What kind of man is he?’ (A25:31)
  (2) mo-‘ára t-óð6x †la-d-áyya qá†u t-la ""axlàl5ni?} ‘What solution can we find
      for this cat so that it does not eat us?’ (A44:1)
  (3) ""áwwa mò-qal6t bèxy5le?} ‘What sound of screaming is this?’ (A4:44)
  (4) ""áwwa mut-qàl5le?} ‘What noise is this?’ (A26:53)
  (5) ""áyya mòdi mðít5la?} ‘What town is this?’ (A26:26)The particle may also function as an exclamatory modifier of nouns, e.g.  (6) ""ína mù-brata!} ‘But what a girl!’ (A13:11)More frequently the particle is used as an interrogative particle indepen-
dently of a head noun, e.g.  (7) mò-b>y6t?} ‘What do you want?’ (A13:13)
  (8) mòdi wídle?} ‘What did he do?’ (A25:19)It is also used as an exclamatory interrogative in constructions such as (9)
and (10), also occasionally in exclamatory assertions (11):
550                          chapter fourteen  (9)  mu-ß†ímlux bˆ°i?!} ‘Why have you destroyed me (literally: my house)?!’
       (A15:14)
  (10) mùt hole-póíla?} ‘How could it be that it is crooked?’ (A17:20)
  (11) téla mo-†réle ""êlla!} ‘How the fox ran to it!’ (A49:4)14.9.13. ma-
This particle may be used in the same way as mo and its variants as an
interrogative modifier of a noun, e.g.   (1) ""ánna ma-brinànela gu-réšux?} ‘What wounds are these on your head?’
       (A29:6)
   (2) ""ánna ma-dàw5la?} ‘What (type of ) gold are they?’ (A7:13)It may be used as an exclamatory modifier of a noun, e.g.  (3)   ""u-Bèlb6l Hazár y>ðátla ma-báxta xàm°5la.} ‘You know what a beautiful
        woman B6lb6l Hazar is.’ (A8:65)It is occasionally used in other syntactic positions to mark prominence.
These include before adjectives (4), in exclamatory statements (5) and
before negated questions (6)–(7):  (4)   mríle ma-d°s téla.} ‘The fox really became ill.’ (A32:32)
  (5)   ma-píšt6t kawêlla!} ‘How you have become a ruin!’ (A18:16)

The expression of the perfect by a compound construction consisting of
the resultative participle (q†ila) and the copula is widespread across the
NENA group, but is not found in the north-western periphery (Bohtan
and Hertevin) or in the south-eastern periphery (Sanandaj). This sug-
gests that it is an innovation of the other dialects. The compound verbal
construction consisting of an infinitive and copula for the expression of
the progressive aspect is also an innovation that is not found in Bohtan,
Hertevin and Sanandaj. Its distribution, however, is less widespread than
                                     introduction                               13the resultative participle construction. It is not found in Qaraqosh, nor
in various other dialects in the southern half of the NENA area in the
Arbìl and Sulemaniyya provinces of Iraq (e.g. Ankawa, Shaqlawa, villages
in the region of Aqra, B6dj6l, Koy Sanjak, Sulemaniyya), all of which
express the progressive with constructions based on the present base of
the verb (qa†6l ).24
   The close relationship of C. Barwar with the local group of dialects is
reflected also in shared lexical items that are not used across the entire
NENA group. A few representative examples are given in table 4:                                          Table 4

Among these lexical items, the extension of the semantic range of the
form t6mm6l/t6mmal to include not only its original meaning of ‘yesterday’
but also the meaning of ‘tomorrow’ is a clear innovation.
   In general, outside the local region C. Barwar has a greater affiliation
with dialects in the region of the north-eastern and south-western periph-
eries than with those on the north-western and south-eastern peripheries.
It exhibits the greatest affiliation with dialects in the region of the north-
eastern periphery. These relationships are reflected most clearly in the
distribution of shared innovations, such as the development of compound
verbal forms and the innovative lexical features.","[51, 52]"
"19.5.1. Protasis19.5.1.1. qa†6l
The qa†6l form is commonly used in a protasis referring to a future situa-
tion the occurrence of which the speaker believes is a real possibility. The
form is perfective, since it presents actions delimited with a start and end
point or at least with a start point., e.g.  (1)   ""6n-""amr•nnux ""áp-""ati b-šàn6t.} ‘If I tell you, you will faint.’ (A11:2)
  (2)   ""6n-""áz6x ""á°‰6t bàbux,} y>ðêtle?} ‘If we go to the land of your father,
        will you recognize it?’ (A14:90)
  (3)   ""6n-pálš6x m6n-d-áni qa†lìl6n.} ‘If we fight with them, they will kill us.’
        (A14:44)
  (4)   ""6n-""ánna mt>m6mêtla,} ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘If you fulfil these (conditions),
        I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                        1005  (5) ""6n-lá-""az6n mšàyð6n.} ‘If I do not go, he will go mad.’ (A4:27)
  (6) ""6n-lá-""oð6t b-xábr6t ""alàha,} b-talqèti.} ‘If you do not do the word of God,
      you will be obliterated.’ (A8:97)In verbs denoting mental processes, which tend to avoid the compound
progressive construction (§15.1.1.4.), the qa†6l form is used imperfectively
to express a possible situation in the present, e.g.  (7) ""6n-b8y6t ""áz6t d7‰6t †la-b7°6t bàb6x,} t•mm6l m>d6‰ênn6x.} ‘If you want to
      go and return to the house of your father, I shall send you back
      tomorrow.’ (A4:42)
  (8) ""•n b>yêtli,} ""á°6t bá°ri ""ap-""àti.} ‘If you love me, you should follow me.’
      (A14:102)19.5.1.2. qa†6lwa
This form is used where the protasis refers to a possible habitual situation
in the past, e.g.  (1) ""6n-b>y•xwa tùma,} †la-mbašàlta,} kèf6nile.} ‘If we wanted (to use) garlic
      for cooking, it was up to us.’ (B10:24)
  (2) bár hàd6x} ""•n q>†íwa x6yalèy} y-amríwa ""áxni ràziy6x.} ‘Afterwards, if they
      had made a decision, they would say “We agree.” ’ (B5:4)Sometimes it is used to refer to a real situation in the past. In such cases
it is often appropriate to translate the conditional particle ‘when’, since
it denotes a situation that the speaker knows to be true. The motivation
to use a conditional construction here does not arise out of the degree
of certainty regarding the event. Rather the construction is used here as
a device to introduce the situation described in the protasis as a topical
frame for what follows, it being a more powerful presentative device than
a factive temporal clause, e.g.  (3) ""6n-par•qwa ""Èšwu†,} ""áw ""6srí-tmanya yomá°a yan-""6srí-""6óóa yomànele,}
      y-az•xwa †ùra.} ‘If February was finished—it is twenty-eight or
      twenty-nine days long—we would go to the mountains (= As for
      when February was finished . . .).’ (B5:152)
  (4) fa-""6n-ma†iníwale ""í°wa xàwla.} ‘If they loaded it, there was a rope (= As
      for when they loaded it . . .).’ (B5:128)
1006                            chapter nineteenThe qa†6lwa form may also be used in a protasis to express modal remote-
ness. It is used to refer to a counterfactual situation in the past, which the
speaker knows did not take place in reality, or to a situation in the present
or future that the speaker knows cannot or will not in reality take place.
Such hypothetical conditions refer to a single event or an iterative event.
The verb can be interpreted as expressing perfective aspect, presenting
the action as an event delimited by a start and endpoint, or at least with
a start point. In the case of iterative actions, the speaker uses the form
that is appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence of the
iterated situation, e.g.  (5)  ""6n-maxéwala xa-xéna xa°màwa} t-axlàwale.} ‘If he had hit another
       (blow), she would have healed and eaten him.’ (A50:14)
  (6) ""6n-maßéwa t-axêlwala,} lˆla xamúße.} ‘If he could have eaten them,
       (he would not have said that) they were sour.’ (A43:4)
  (7) ""6n-maßênwa,} t-a°ênwa.} ‘If I could, I would come.’
  (8) ""6n-mbaqrêtwa,} t-yaw•nwalux zùze,} bás là mbuq•rrux.} ‘If you had asked,
       I would have given you money, but you did not ask.’
  (9) ""6n-y>ð•nwa manay-díye mòdile,} t-amr•nwalux dìya,} bas lˆð6n.} ‘If I knew
       its meaning, I would tell you now, but I do not know.’
  (10) ""6n-maßênwa,} t-a°ênwa,} bás lè-y-maß6n.} ‘If I could, I would come,
       but I cannot.’19.5.1.3. q†ille / q6m-qa†6l
The past perfective forms q†ille and q6m-qa†6l are commonly used in the
protasis to denote a possible situation in the future, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-kpìnni,} t-axlênne.} ‘If I get hungry, I shall eat it.’ (A23:5)
  (2)   ""6n-mp5qèli} garš•tli †¬a-gére m•nne dìye.} ""u-""6n-là mp5qéli,} ""ána pálx6n b-réše
        b>l?š.} ‘If I split it, you will produce for me three arrows from it.
        If I do not split it, I shall work over it for free.’ (A12:44)
  (3)   ""6n-š8r6† díyi q6m-y>ðêtla,} xo-b-gawrànnux.} ""6n-š8r6† díyi là q6m-y>ð•tla,}

        to) my challenge (literally: condition), I shall indeed marry you.
        If you do not know (the answer to) my challenge, I shall put your
        head in that opening that remains.’ (A25:62)
  (4)   ""6n-báxtux mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxti mu°éla bròna,} brátux qa-bròni.} ""6n-báxti
        mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxtux mu°éla bròna,} ""a-bráti qa-brònux.} ‘If your wife

  (5)   ""6n-°èli} xó bàxtiw6t.} ""u-""6n-là-°eli,} kú-m6ndit ""áwð6t wùð.} ‘If I come
        back, then you are my wife. If I do not come back, do anything
        you want.’ (A25:66)
  (6)   qrˆla!} ""6n-mjuwêbla,} xo-""àn6n ""•°ya k•sl6x.} ""6n-là mjuw•bla,} ""àtit °í°a k•sli.}
        ‘Call them! If they answer you, then indeed it is me who has come
        to you. If they do not answer you, you have come to me.’ (A26:4)
  (7)   ""6n-°éle mbuq•rre xa-nàša,} m•re d-ˆni?} ""ámr6t t-""Ájd6n tèl5la.} ‘If some-
        body comes and asks saying “Whose are they?”, say they belong
        to Ajd6n the fox.’ (A32:20)These past forms are also used in protases that refer to possible habitual
situations in the present. Several examples are found in the description
of games in text B11, e.g.  (8)  ""6n-là-mxele ""íðe-lle,} w-áwwa °éle dwíqle ""o-q7sa t-íle dúk°6t m†awàlta,}
       xàsri.} ‘If he does not strike him with his hand and he comes and
       holds the stick which is the place of the game, they lose.’ (B11:14)
  (9) ""6n-là xsírrey} ""ánna-t qrìmla} mšaxêlpi.} ‘If they do not lose, the ones
       that have won change (place).’ (B11:9)
  (10) ""6n-kúlla q6m-maxíla b6rrèy} ""áw q6m-dawqíle ""o-q7sa t-íle be-pàlga,} °èla}
       xá m6n-d-ánna t-íla qam-t9ra,} °éle q6m-dawêqle,} xsìrra ""an-gawáye.} ‘If
       they break up all their group or seize the piece of wood that is in
       the middle, if one of those who are outside comes and seizes it,
       those inside lose.’ (B11:9)19.5.1.4. q†ilwale
This form is attested only rarely in the protasis. In (1) it refers to a habitual
situation in the past:  (1)   ""6n-twírwala t•rna} t-xa m6nnèy} y-aw•lwala qa-t-wáha šaqêlwa m•nne.}
        ‘If both (sides) of one of the eggs broke, he would give it to the
        other person to take it from him.’ (B5:59)19.5.1.5. Present Copula
The present copula is used in a protasis that denotes a possible situation
in the present. The enclitic form of the copula is used and this is attached
to the conditional particle ""6n rather than to the predicate of the clause.
The explanation for this is probably that the construction ""6n + copula
1008                            chapter nineteenhas developed historically from ""6n + D + copula (e.g. ""6n-ile < ""6n-t-ile). As
we have seen, the subordinating particle D regularly attracts the copula
enclitic. The conditional construction ""6n + D + copula is, in fact, the
norm in several other NENA dialects. Examples:  (1) ""6n-íle mì°a,} g8r6g mˆ°6n.} ‘If he is dead, I must die.’ (A8:61)
  (2) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila.} ‘If he is my nephew, he
      will come and he will know what these are.’ (A25:49)
  (3) ""6n-""íle ""úrza gáw‰a xoš-qày6m,} mjarbênne.} ‘If he is a brave man, let him
      get up and I shall test my mettle with him.’ (A29:27)
  (4) ""6n-ít xonˆni,} háyyo tu-""áxxa k6slˆni.} ‘If you are our brother, come and
      sit here with us.’ (A39:7)
  (5) ""6n-ít ßìya,} hó""la mìya.} ""6n-it-kpìna,} hó""le xùl.} ‘If you are thirsty, here is
      water. If you are hungry, here eat.’ (A28:18)Occasionally the present copula is omitted from the protasis, e.g.  (6) ""6n-réš6t bábe díye ""ax-†ùra,} ""u-hóle q†íla l-T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi,} lˆka bt-
      áz6l?} ‘If the head of his father is like a mountain and he has been
      killed by T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi, where will he go?’ (A28:8)19.5.1.6. Past copula
The past copula is sporadically used in the protasis to express a habitual
situation in the past, as is the case in (1). Since the situation is known by
the speaker to have taken place, the primary function of the construction
should be regarded as being to present a topical frame:  (1) ""6n-wéwa šèr-Dùre,} kúlla náše ""o-yóma y-azíwa šèr-Dùre.} ‘If there was
      a saint’s day festival in Dure, everybody on that day would go to
      Dure.’ (B5:228)19.5.1.7. Existential Particle
The present existential particle is used to refer to possible situations in the
present, either those that may actually exist or those that are habitual, e.g.  (1) ""6n-""í° pàwxa,} ""i-marmíle gu-hàwa.} ‘If there is wind, they raise it in the
      air.’ (B5:97)
  (2) ""6n-""ítla mója zòra} qám-ma xalwàla,} mam6ßála xà‘‘a-w} ‘If it has a small
      calf, before she (the milkmaid) milks it, she allows it to give suck (to
      the calf ) a little.’ (B5:175)
                     syntactic subordination of clauses                               1009  (3) ""6n-""ítlux fer•sse b8y6t pàlš6t,} hadíya ""ána hon-""ê°ya} †lába bràtux,} b8y6t yawêtla,}
      b8y6t pálš6t kèfux!} ‘If you have warriors and you want to fight—now,
      I have come to ask for the hand of your daughter, whether you want
      to give her or whether you fight is up to you.’ (A29:58)The present existential particle, may have a past habitual function, as in
(4). Alternatively the past existential particle may be used, as in (5):  (4) ""6n-""í°-qaša táma mßalˆwa-w} kúlley y-axlìwa.} ‘If a priest was there, they
      would pray and everybody would eat.’ (B5:68)
  (5) ""6n-""ítwal6n mànqal,} d5r•xwa gu-mànqal.} ‘If we had a griddle, we would
      put it on the griddle.’ (B10:6)19.5.1.8. Compound Verbal Forms with the Present Copula
Compound forms consisting of the present copula + resultative participle
or present copula + infinitive are occasionally used in a protasis to refer
to a situation that possibly holds in the present. In some of the attested
examples the copula element is attached to the conditional particle as
expected (1–2), but in some cases it remains cliticized to the end of the
verbal form (3–4):  (1) ""•n-in ""àna ""•°ya gu-šwí°6x,} qr7g6n xaddàm6x.} ‘If I have come to sleep in
      your bed, call your servants.’ (A26:4)
  (2) ""6n-it ""•°ya šúl6t qa˙bù°a,} k6s-báb6n B9ku.} ‘If you have come to forni-
      cate, then (lodge) with our father B>ku.’ (A26:26)
  (3) ""6n-""áyya ""is•q°i xˆr6t,} ""6n-†úw6t ""is•q°i bdìl5le,} mšadrátla ""árye t-à°a,} ""ána
      gu-""awqàn6n.} ‘If you watch this ring, if the diamond of my ring
      changes (in colour), send the lions so that they come (to me), for I
      am in trouble.’ (A18:13)
  (4) ""6n-m>xób6t p7š6t ""àxxa,} ""áti p7š6t mal•k°a šòpi.} ‘If you would like to stay
      here, you will become queen in my place in this land.’ (A4:42)In (5) the deictic copula is used with the resultative participle in a protasis
referring to a representative case of an habitual event. The situation is
certain to exist and the conditional particle could be appropriately trans-
lated ‘when’. The protasis, therefore, has a topic presentative function.
This is reflected in the use of the deictic copula, which has a presentative,
attention drawing function:
1010                            chapter nineteen  (5) ""6n-xá náša dìyux} yan-xá bráta díyux hot-híw6lla qa-ðà-ma°a,} píše xêzme.}
      ‘If/when you have given somebody of your family or a daughter of
      yours to a certain village (in marriage), (the two families) become
      relatives.’ (B5:232)19.5.1.9. hawe
The form hawe is used in place of the present copula to refer to a
situation in the present that the speaker regards as being unlikely to be
realized, e.g.  (1) ""6n-háw5 ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ""axwá°ux hawnàne,} la-ma†étuwa l-àwwa l•xma.}
      ‘If ten other men from ˇiyare were as intelligent as you, you would
      not have reached this (miserable condition of begging for) bread.’
      (B17:16)It may be used in a protasis that refers to a present habitual situation, e.g.  (2) ""•n har-hóya talìlta} har-qítla ""íðux bíya díya xà‘‘a,} k7ma ""íð6t nàša,} ""i-ß9wa
      y-amr•xla.} ‘If it is still wet, as soon as your hand touches it, the hand
      of the person (who touches it) becomes black, it is dyed, as we say.’
      (B5:216)It is used to refer to a future situation that the speaker assesses to be a
realistic possibility, e.g.  (3) ""6n-hóya rázi š•nna díya p>làla,} pálga †la-d-áy ""u-pálga †la-d-àw,} maqimêxle.}
      ‘If she will be happy to share her years, half for her and half for
      him, we shall resurrect him.’ (A4:46)
  (4) ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.} ‘If I were to have a daughter, I
      would give her to your son.’ (A25:8)
  (5) ""6n-háwe t-têrte ""aqlá°a,} ""ána b-zawnênne.} ‘If it were two legged, I would
      buy it.’ (A22:5)
  (6) ""6n-hàwa} ""•óói-u ""•óóa maq6lbênna.} ""u-""6n-hàwa} ""•mma-w-xà-≥i,} la-b>yênna.}
      ‘If they are ninety-nine, I shall return them. If they are even one
      hundred and one, I don’t want them.’ (A6:1)19.5.1.10. hawewa
This form is used to express remote modality in a protasis. In (1) it has
present time reference and denotes a situation that the speaker judges to
be completely hypothetical and impossible to fulfil in the real world. In
(2) it denotes a counterfactual situation in the past:
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                       1011  (1) ""6n-haw•twa gu-""á°‰a dìyi,} kú-m6ndi b>y•twa t-yànwalux.} ‘If you were in
      my country, I would give you whatever you wanted.’ (A26:57)
  (2) ""ána b-gáni ""6n-haw•nwa tàma} ta-t-taqlênwale} là-mß6nwa taql•nwale.} ‘If
      I myself were there (and tried) to lift it, I could not have lifted it.’
      (A51:20)19.5.1.11. wela
In the protasis of (1) the q†ille form of hwy is used to describe a possible
punctual event in the future:  (1) sab-lá-hoya biš-p°ì°a,} ""6n-wéla biš-p°ì°a,} y-ámr6xxa dàrpa,} yá'ni ßàlya,}
      t-á°e sêtwa} t-á°ya tàlga m•ndi.} ‘This was because (the space) must not
      be wider. If it were to become wider, (the roof) would collapse, as we
      say, that is it would come down, when it was winter and the snow
      arrived.’ (B5:189)19.5.1.12. hawewa q†ila
This compound verbal form is normally used in a protasis as a modally
remote expression in order to denote a counterfactual perfective event in
the past, e.g.  (1) ""6n-""ána haw•nwa q†íl6lla "">yáha ""aqêrwa,} ""áwwa xúwwe t-awéwa q†íla
      †la-bròni.} ‘If I had killed that scorpion, that snake would have killed
      my son.’ (A9:6)
  (2) ""6n-hawéwa kálba zíla qamàya,} qa†líwa kàlba.} ‘If the dog had gone first,
      they would have killed the dog.’ (C8:5)

      a little further along, (where it is) deeper, I would have brought out
      for you from there some of those big sheep with fat tails and horns
      (big) like this.’ (A7:22)
  (4) ""o-š6ndóxa ""•n-hawewa qí°a bìyi} t-aw•twa q†ìl6lli.} ‘If that rock had hit
      me, you would have killed me.’ (A1:25)
  (5) ""6n-haw•twa mìr6lli} t-aw6nwá-""6°ya t-amr•nwala ""an-šère} ‘If you had told
      me, I would have come to recite these poems.’ (B1:14)
  (6) ""6n-""ána haw•nwa wíða m-bàbi,} ""up-""áti t-oðêtwa m•nni.} ‘If I had done a
      good service to my father, you also would have done a good service
      to me.’ (A41:6)In is occasionally used to denote a state resulting from a habitual action
in the past, e.g.
1012                          chapter nineteen  (7) xéna ""6n-hawéwa bêsra,} ""6n-háw6xwa príme ""êrwe,} dˆr6xwa b•sra.} ‘If there
      was meat, if we had slaughtered sheep, we would serve meat.’ (B10:19)19.5.1.13. Compound Forms Containing t-awe
A few marginal cases are attested in which the protasis contains a com-
pound verbal form consisting of an infinitive or verbal noun and the
future form t-awe (< b6d-hawe), e.g.  (1) ""6n-t-áwe jwàjta,} b-šàx6n.} ‘If he moves (on one occasion), he warms
      up.’ (B11:16)
  (2) m•re báre xa-mêndi} qa-d-áwwa ""áw6ð xa-‘ˆra,} ""6n-t-áwe ràqa,} qa-t-""áw6ð
      xa-‘ˆra qa-gáne.} ‘He said “(In case) something happens,” so that he
      could find a way out (of trouble), so that, if he was fleeing, he could
      find for himself a way out (of trouble).’ (A18:17)19.5.2. Apodosis
Apodosis clauses contain various types of verbal form. These include a
number of forms that contain the prefixed particle b6d-.19.5.2.1. b6d-qa†6l
This is the regular future form and is used as a future verb in apodoses
that follow protases referring to the present or the future, e.g.  (1) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila.} ‘If he is my nephew, he will
      come and he will know what these are.’ (A25:49)
  (2) ""6n-kpìnni,} t-axlênne.} ‘If I am hungry, I shall eat it.’ (A23:5)
  (3) ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.} ‘If I were to have a daughter, I
      would give her to your son.’ (A25:8)
  (4) ""6n-lá-""oð6t b-xábr6t ""alàha,} b-talqèti.} ‘If you do not do the word of
      God, you will be obliterated.’ (A8:97)19.5.2.2. b6d-qa†6lwa
This form is used in the apodosis of conditional sentences that refer to
a hypothetical condition in the past, which was not fulfilled (1), or to a
hypothetical condition in the present or future, which the speaker assesses
to be impossible to fulfil (2–3). It is perfective in aspect:  (1) ""6n-mbaqrêtwa,} t-yaw•nwalux zùze,} bás là mbuq•rrux.} ‘If you had asked,
      I would have given you money, but you did not ask.’
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                       1013  (2) ""6n-maßênwa,} t-a°ênwa,} bás lè-y-maß6n} ‘If I could, I would come, but
      I cannot.’
  (3) ""6n-haw•twa gu-""á°‰a dìyi,} kú-m6ndi b>y•twa t-yànwalux.} ‘If you were in
      my country, I would give you whatever you wanted.’ (A26:57)19.5.2.3. qa†6l
This form is commonly used in apodoses after protases referring to pos-
sible events in the present or future, e.g.  (1) ""6n-pálš6x m6n-d-áni qa†lìl6n.} ‘If we fight with them they will kill us.’
      (A14:44)
  (2) ""6n-b8y6t ""áz6t d7‰6t †la-b7°6t bàb6x,} t•mm6l m>d6‰ênn6x.} ‘If you want to
      go and return to the house of your father, I shall send you back
      tomorrow.’ (A4:42)
  (3) ""6n-mp5qèli} garš•tli †¬a-gére m•nne dìye.} ‘If I split it, you will produce
      for me three arrows from it.’ (A12:44)
  (4) ""•n b>yêtli,} ""á°6t bá°ri ""ap-""àti.} ‘If you love me, you should follow me.’
      (A14:102)19.5.2.4. ""i-qa†6l
This is attested in apodoses after protases that refer to a real habitual
situation in the present, e.g.  (1) ""6n-""í° pàwxa,} ""i-marmíle gu-hàwa.} ‘If there is wind, they raise it in the
      air.’ (B5:97)19.5.2.5. qa†6lwa
This form is attested in two types of constructions. It is used in apodoses
that denote past habitual situations, e.g.  (1) ""u-""6n-í°6n náše ""•°ye m-ma°wá°a xène,} kút-xa šáq6lwa xákma x6zmàn-dìye,}
      mas•qla k6sle-díye †la-f†àrta.} ‘If there are people who have come from
      other villages, each person would take some of his relatives and take
      them up to his home for breakfast.’ (B5:60)It also occurs in apodoses expressing counterfactual situations in the past,
e.g.  (2) ""6n-háw5 ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ""axwá°ux hawnàne,} la-ma†étuwa l-àwwa l•xma,}
      ""u-""attítuwa láxxa p5šítuwa hátxa snìqe.} ‘If ten other men from ˇiyare
1014                            chapter nineteen       were as intelligent as you, you would not have reached this (miserable
       condition of begging for) bread, you would not be sitting here and
       have become so poor.’ (B17:16)19.5.2.6. ""i-qa†6lwa
This is found in apodoses after protases with a topic presentative function
that refer to a real habitual situation in the past, e.g.  (1) bár hàd6x} ""•n q>†íwa x6yalèy} y-amríwa ""áxni ràziy6x.} ‘Afterwards, if they
      had made a decision, they would say “We agree.” ’ (B5:4)
  (2) ""6n-par•qwa ""%šwu†,} ""áw ""6srí-tmanya yomá°a yan-""6srí-""6óóa yomànele,}
      y-az•xwa †ùra.} ‘If February was finished—it is twenty-eight or
      twenty-nine days long—we would go to the mountains (= As for
      when February was finished . . .).’ (B5:152)
  (3) ""6n-wéwa šèr-Dùre,} kúlla náše ""o-yóma y-azíwa šèr-Dùre.} ‘If there was
      a saint’s day festival in Dure, everybody on that day would go to
      Dure.’ (B5:228)19.5.2.7. q†ille / q6m-qa†6l
The past perfective q†ille form and its functionally equivalent alternant
q6m-qa†6l are rarely used in apodoses. It is attested in (1) and (2), which
refer to a habitual situation in the present:  (1) ""6n-""axlênna kúlla,} prìqla †awálta.} ‘If I eliminate (literally: eat) them all,
      the game is finished.’ (B11:22)
  (2) ""6n-kúlla q6m-maxíla b6rrèy} ""áw q6m-dawqíle ""o-q7sa t-íle be-pàlga,} °èla} xá
      m6n-d-ánna t-íla qam-t9ra,} °éle q6m-dawêqle,} xsìrra ""an-gawáye.} ‘If they
      break up all their group or seize the piece of wood that is in the
      middle, if one of those who are outside comes and seizes it, those
      inside lose.’ (B11:9)19.5.2.8. Copula
A form of the copula is used in the apodosis in various circumstances, e.g.  (1) ""6n-b>y•xwa tùma,} †la-mbašàlta,} kèf6nile.} ‘If we wanted (to use) garlic
      for cooking, it was up to us.’ (B10:24)
  (2) ""6n-ít ßìya,} hó""la mìya.} ""6n-it-kpìna,} hó""le xùl.} ‘If you are thirsty, here is
      water. If you are hungry, here eat.’ (A28:18)
  (3) ""6n-lá ""òð6t,} kli°à-llux-ila.} ‘If you do not do so, it is up to you.’
      (A8:44)
                     syntactic subordination of clauses                           1015  (4) ""6n-lá z5r•nna QÆdus,} lˆla qbílta ˙ajjiyú°i.} ‘If I do not visit Jerusalem,
      my pilgrimage is not accepted.’ (A2:1)19.5.2.9. Existential Particle
The existential particle is attested in the apodosis in (1) after a protasis
expressing a habitual situation in the past, which has a topic presentative
function:  (1) fa-""6n-ma†iníwale ""í°wa xàwla.} ‘If they loaded it, there was a rope (= As
      for when they loaded it . . .).’ (B5:128)19.5.2.10. Resultative participle + present copula
The compound form q†il5le with the present copula is attested in the
apodosis of (1), the protasis of which denotes the possible evidence for
the situation in the apodosis:  (1) qrˆla!} ""6n-mjuwêbla,} xo-""àn6n ""•°ya k•sl6x.} ""6n-là mjuw•bla,} ""àtit °í°a k•sli.}
      ‘Call them! If they answer you, then indeed it is me who has come
      to you. If they do not answer you, you have come to me.’ (A26:4)19.5.2.11. t-awewa q†ila
This form occurs in apodoses expressing the consequent of counterfactual
events in the past, e.g.  (1) ""6n-""ána haw•nwa q†íl6lla "">yáha ""aqêrwa,} ""áwwa xúwwe t-awéwa q†íla
      †la-bròni.} ‘If I had killed that scorpion, that snake would have killed
      my son’. (A9:6)
  (2) ""6n-haw•twa mìr6lli} t-aw6nwá-""6°ya t-amr•nwala ""an-šère.} ‘If you had told
      me, I would have come to recite these poems.’ (B1:14)19.5.2.12. Imperative
On several occasions the apodosis contains an imperative form:  (1) ""6n-ít xonˆni,} háyyo tu-""áxxa k6slˆni.} ‘If you are our brother, come and
      sit here with us.’ (A39:7)
  (2) ""u-""6n-là-°eli,} kú-m6ndit ""áwð6t wùð.} ‘If I do not come back, do anything
      you want.’ (A25:66)
  (3) ""•n-in ""àna ""•°ya gu-šwí°6x,} qr7g6n xaddàm6x.} ‘If I have come to sleep
      in you bed, call your servants.’ (A26:4)
1016                           chapter nineteen  (4) ""6n-°éla píšla x9†ar ""•llux qúrba,} dríla ""an-bóóe l-""9ra.} ‘If danger comes
      near to you, put these two seeds in the ground.’ (A18:14)19.5.2.13. Verb Omitted
In some contexts the verb of the apodosis is omitted when it can be
understood from the context, e.g.  (1) ""6n-báxtux mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxti mu°éla bròna,} brátux qa-bròni.} ‘If your
       wife gives birth to a girl and my wife gives birth to boy, your daughter
       (will be married) to my son.’ (A25:2–3)
  ( 2) m•re ""7ka p7š6n ""àrxa?} m•ra ""6n-ít xoš-gàw‰a} k6s-Qára Tè≥din.} ‘He said
       “Where can I lodge as a guest?” They said “If you are a good man,
       (you can lodge with) with Qara Te≥din.” ’ (A26:26)19.5.2.14. Apodosis Introduced by Particle(i) xo-/xu-
On some occasions the apodosis is introduced by the intensifying particle
xo-/xu- (§17.9.2.), e.g.  (1) ""6n-š8r6† díyi q6m-y>ðêtla,} xo-b-gawrànnux.} ‘If you know (the answer to)
      my test, I shall indeed marry you.’ (A25:62)
  (2) ""6n-°èli} xó bàxtiw6t.} ‘If I come back, then you are my wife.’
      (A25:66)
  (3) qrˆla!} ""6n-mjuwêbla,} xo-""àn6n ""•°ya k•sl6x.} ‘Call them! If they answer
      you, then indeed it is me who has come to you.’ (A26:4)(ii) ""ap
The connective particle ""ap is also used to introduce the apodosis when it
opens with an independent topical subject pronoun. This can be identified
with the discourse boundary marking function of ""ap (§18.1.3.1.), which is
applied here to give added prominence to the apodosis, e.g.  (1) ""6n-""amr•nnux ""áp-""ati b-šàn6t.} ‘If I tell you, you will faint.’ (A11:2)19.5.3. Protasis after the Apodosis
A condition expressed in a protasis is occasionally placed after its conse-
quent. The protasis in such cases generally has the status of a tag that
elaborates on what precedes, sometimes as an afterthought, e.g.
                     syntactic subordination of clauses                             1017  (1) máß6t t-óð6t rába m6ndiyáne m•nne dìye,} ""6n-ila zawdàne.} ‘You can make
      make many (other) things from them, if they are left over.’ (B5:219)
  (2) m-bár †axnìle,} páy6š qàmxa,} masqíle bˆ°a,} ""ax-t-m•ri m8°>lan ""6n-b8yi t-yápi
      l•xma m6nnéy zeðàye,} mtárßi m6nnéy †êlme.} ‘After they grind it and it
      becomes flour, they take it up to the house, as I said, if they want,
      for example, to bake pitta breads from it or make thin breads.’
      (B5:99)
  (3) ""ána b-zawnênne} ""ína ""6n-háwe †¬à ""aqlá°a.} ‘I shall buy it, but only if it
      has three legs.’ (A22:3)19.5.4. Conditional after the Verb ‘to wait’
A conditional clause introduced by the particle ""6n may be used as the
complement of the verb spr ‘to wait’, e.g.  (1) sàpri} ""6n-háwe pàwxa.} ‘They wait for there to be wind.’ (B5:97)19.5.5. ""6n-la and ""6lla
The negation of a protasis that is placed before the apodosis is expressed
by combining the conditional particle with the negator in the uncontracted
phrase ""6n-lá with stress on the negator. This is typically used in contexts
where the clause expresses a negative alternative to a situation described in
the preceding context. As a result, the remaining content of the clause is
given or at least inferrable from what precedes and the main information
prominence is on the negator rather than the clause content, e.g.  (1) ""6n-mp5qèli} garš•tli †¬a-gére m•nne dìye.} ""u-""6n-là mp5qéli,} ""ána pálx6n b-réše
      b>l?š.} ‘If I split it, you will produce for me three arrows from it.
      If I do not split it, I shall work over it for free.’ (A12:44)
  (2) ""6n-°èli} xó bàxtiw6t.} ""u-""6n-là-°eli,} kú-m6ndit ""áwð6t wùð.} ‘If I come back, then
      you are my wife. If I do not come back, do anything you want.’ (A25:66)
  (3) ""á puqdán6t ""alàh5le.} ""6n-lá-""oð6t b-xábr6t alàha,} b-talqèti.} ‘This is God’s
      command (which you must obey). If you do not do the word of God,
      you will be obliterated.’ (A8:97)The content of the protasis clause indeed is sometimes gapped com-
pletely, e.g.  (4) r8pili m-an-képe t-íla tàma,} ga-maxz•nnux ""úrxa ßàl6t.} ""6n-lá tàma t-áw6t.}
      ‘Throw me the stones that are there, then I shall show you the way
      down. If not, you will remain there.’ (A14:70)
1018                            chapter nineteen  (5)   ""6n-hóya rázi š•nna díya p>làla} . . . maqimêxle.} x8yi m-©ðàðe} †¬á°i šênne-w}
        m7°i m-©ðàðe.} ""u-""6n-là"",} har-""àxxa t-óya ""•šti š•nne.} ‘If she is happy to
        share her years, . . . we shall resurrect him. They will live together
        thirty years and die together. If not, she will stay here for sixty
        years.’ (A4:46)
  (6)   mqáwl6t goràtle,} t-yálla jùlla.} ""6n-là,} har-t-yálla júll6x b-kèf6x.} ‘If you
        promise to marry him, he will give back the clothes. If not, he
        will still give you the clothes, if you want them.’ (A14:83)The particle ""•lla, which is a contraction of ""6n-la with the stress on the
conditional particle rather than the negator, is used in clauses that come
after a negated main clause. The content of the clause introduced by ""•lla
has higher information value than a clause introduce by ""6n-lá. An ""•lla
clause is typically not given in the prior discourse whereas the preceding
main clause is bound to the preceding context in some way, e.g.  (7)   b-‘u-""úrxa ""o-D6md•ma l7 šaqlìtule} ""•lla q>†ítula míy6t D6mdêma.} ‘By no
        means will you capture D6md6ma unless you cut off the water of
        D6md6ma.’ (A11:17)
  (8)   x•tna lè-y-ax6l} ""•lla qablíle xà-m6ndi.} ‘The groom would not eat unless
        they pledged something to him.’ (B10:40)
  (9)   ""ána mírt5w6n le-y-""á°y6n b-xábr6t ‘ù-""urza,} ""•lla t-á°ya báxta ma°yàli.}
        ‘I said that I would not come by the word of any man, unless a
        woman came to fetch me.’ (A8:94)Occasionally a postposed protasis with ""6n-lá has a content that is not given
in the preceding context. In such cases, however, the clause generally still
does not have the same informational prominence as clauses introduced
by ""•lla. This is seen in (10) where the protasis clause expresses an action
that is circumstantial to the action of the main clause. The whole sentence
may be paraphrased ‘We brought in sticks having broken them’:  (10) ""áxni la-mor•xwa xa-s6ryóqa gu-b7°a ""6n-lá torêxwale.} ‘We would not
       bring a single twig into the house without breaking it (literally: if
       we did not break it).’ (B10:70)On some occasions the content of a clause introduced by ""•lla is given in
the preceding context, but the speaker uses the construction to give the
clause enhanced prominence. It is typically used when the speaker wishes
to insist forcefully that something be done, e.g.
                     syntactic subordination of clauses                           1019  (11) ""6n-lá gal•tli ""ánna šaqyá°a módi gu-rèšux,} ""ánna brinán6t mòdila} . . . ""6n-là

       ma-brinànela gu-réšux.} ‘If you do not reveal what these scars on your

       to me, I shall not cut your hair . . . I shall not cut your hair, unless
       you tell me what these wounds are on your head.’ (A29:5–6)Clauses expressing insistence that open with ""•lla are sometimes used
independently of a preceding main clause, e.g.  (12) kízla bíye dìye,} m•ra ""êlla gáwr6t.} ‘They tried (to persuade) him and
       said “You must marry.” ’ (A16:6)
  (13) m•re lá b-àlaha,} ""•lla maßl•nn6x ""àna.} ‘No, by God. I shall take you
       down.’ (A29:27)
  (14) là} ""ána har-bt-àz6n.} ""•lla xazyánne xòni.} ‘No. I shall still go. I must
       see my brother.’ (A8:66)In (15) it is combinded with the expression of obligation g>r6g:  (15) ""êlla g8r6g ""áyya bráta gor•nna.} ‘I must marry this girl.’ (A12:55)The construction is sometimes used in the context of oaths, e.g.  (16) la-málka màmi} hóle y•mya b-rèši.} máttu jallàde} ""•lla b-qa†êlli.} ‘Indeed
       the king my uncle has sworn on my head (to execute me). He will
       appoint executioners and (has sworn) he will kill me.’ (A25:36)The particle ""6lla may be used to insist on the veracity of a factual statement, e.g.  (17) ""u-""áwwa-≥i huðáya l-gàre} ""êlla,} ""ánna dáwe ""àn6n hiw•llux.} ‘But this Jew
       on the roof (said) “I insist that it was me who gave you these gold
       coins.” ’ (A6:11)Insistence on a prohibition may be expressed by using a construction
opening with ""6n-lá independently of a main clause, paralleling the use
of ""•lla to express insistence on a command, e.g.  (18) ""á-ß6pra ""íla ròxi,} ""6n-lá qa†líle ""o-táwr6t wàla,} šaqlíle ""o-ßêpra.} ‘That
       sparrow is my spirit. They must not kill that wild ox and take that
       sparrow.’ (A12:41)
1020                            chapter nineteenThe insistent function of ""•lla is sometimes used to express the sense of
‘only if ’, e.g.  (19) ""ána mí°6nwa l-márya ""alàha} ""•lla t-a°yáwa báxta bà°ri,} t-azànwa.} ‘I
       had sworn to the Lord God that only if a woman came after me
       would I go.’ (A8:94)An alternative way of expressing ‘only if ’ is to use the particle ""ax‘i com-
bined with ""6n, e.g.  (20) nablánnux l-""á°‰6t bàbux,} ""áx‘i ""6n-y>ð•tla ""à°‰a.} ‘I shall take you to the
       land of your father, only if you know the land.’ (A14:89)The particle ""•lla may be used to express exclusivity also in other contexts,
including before a nominal (22–23):  (21) lí° b>jàra} ""•lla bt-àz6x.} ‘There is no alternative but that we go.’ (A8:27)
  (22) w-ána hon-m•rta †la-Nozàli} ""ána l5-gáwr6n ""•lla xóna díya Gozàli.} ‘I said
       to Nozali that I would only marry her brother Gozali.’ (A8:95)
  (23) díya ""•lla xá-mdi dàwa b8yi.} ‘Now they want only something made
       of gold.’ (B10:40)It is used also as a clausal connective in the sense of ‘but’, ‘but rather’, e.g.  (24) ""u-‘ú b6‰-náša la-má†e-lla ""•lla b-rzáy6t gána-diya t-à°ya.} ‘Nobody can
       reach her, but rather she comes of her own will.’ (A8:65)
  (25) ""u-""ùp-ati p7š6t m•nn6n,} ""árpa xon>wà°6x.} ""•lla b-šaqlênna} xá°6t Mir-Zán-

       four brothers. But I must (first) take the sister of Mir Zandin to
       marry her to you.’ (A26:39)19.5.6. Non-Conditional Uses of the Particle ""6n
The particle ""6n is sometimes used outside of conditional contexts. These
include the following.","[1043, 1044, 1045, 1046, 1047, 1048, 1049, 1050, 1051, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1055, 1056, 1057, 1058, 1059]"
"  (1) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} brònux-ile xíla xabúša.} ‘A: “Your brother
      has eaten an apple.” B: “No, your son has eaten an apple.” ’
  (2) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:
      “Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten
      a peach. He has not eaten an apple.’ ”
  (3) A: xóni hóle xèzya brat7xu qedàmta} B: l7le qedàmta xèzya brát6n,} têmm6l-ile
      xèzy6lla.} ‘A: “My brother saw your daughter this morning.” B: “He
      did not see our daughter this morning, he saw her yesterday.” ’Examples from the text corpus:  (4) l7w6n °í°a b-xabr6 dìye.} ""áyya xá°e dìyela.} b-xábr6t xá°6 dìy6n °í°a.} ‘I did
      not come at his word. She is his sister. I came at the word of his
      sister.’ (A8:85)
  (5) ""àn6n mú°y6lle.} ‘I (and not my brother) have brought it back.’
      (A24:31)
  (6) yába ""àn6n mšúdr6lla!} ‘I (not God) have sent them!’ (A6:4)
  (7) ""àn6n xèzy6lle,} dìyile.} ‘I (and nobody else) have found it. It is mine.’
      (A14:15)
  (8) ""ànna} Sêttiyela mutt7°6lla láxxa.} ‘S6ttiye (not anybody else) put these
      here.’ (A25:36)In principle when the speaker expresses a narrow focus on one particular
argument of the clause, the proposition of the clause is presupposed to
be known to the hearer and activated in his mind with the exception of
the identity of the argument in question. In (1), for example, the clause
brònux-ile xíla xabúša} is used by the speaker when he presupposes that the
hearer knows that somebody has eaten an apple, i.e. the presuppositional
                               the syntax of verbs                          679background is ‘x has eaten an apple’. What the speaker is asserting, i.e. the
new information that he is conveying, is that x is to be identified as ‘your
son’.8 In many languages this type of argument focus can be expressed
by a cleft sentence, e.g. ‘It is your son who has eaten an apple’, in which
the assertion of the identity of the argument in focus is expressed by an
identificatory predicate and the presupposition is placed in a subordinate
relative clause. The constructions with copula movement such as brònux-
ile xíla xabúša} are not cleft sentences since the presupposition is not in a
relative clause and, moreover, the copula agrees with the subject, even if
this is the asserted argument, e.g. ""àn6n mú°y6lle} ‘I have brought it’ (= It
was me who has brought it). The attachment of the copula to the focused
argument and the placement of the nuclear stress on this argument are,
nevertheless, properties of the predicate of a copula clause. It may be
said, therefore, that the construction possesses some properties of a cleft
sentence but does not have all the components of its structure.
    Clauses exhibiting leftward movement of the copula may have two foci
of contrast, in which case the subject is given preference for the attach-
ment of the enclitic, e.g.  (9)  ""àtit °í°a kêsli.} lán ""àna-""6°ya kêsl6x.} ‘You came to me. I did not come
       to you.’ (A4:4)
  (10) yà-baxta} lan-""àna ""è°ya dmíxa gu-šwì°6x.} ""àtit °í°a dmíxta gu-šwì°i.}
       ‘Woman, I have not come to sleep in your bed. You have come to
       sleep in my bed.’ (A26:4)The presuppositional background of these constructions would have two
unknown variables, e.g. ‘x came to y’ and the speaker is asserting the
identity of both of these.
   The intention of the new information focus may be to express exclu-
sivity, e.g.  (11) har-""àtit plíxa} ‘Only you have worked.’ (A21:15)
  (12) kúlla hóla q†ìle.} bas-àn6n šrí†a.} ‘They have all been killed. Only I
       have escaped.’ (B19:8)The presuppositional background of these examples would be ‘x has
worked’ and ‘x has escaped’ respectively.","[717, 718]"
"15.8.1. Continuity
(i) When it has the sense of ‘remaining’, it can be used absolutely, without
any complement except for an optional adverbial, e.g.  (1)   p7ši xètna-w k yálo tàma} hal-xušèba.} ‘The groom and bride stay there
        until Sunday.’ (B5:51)
  (2)   ""áwwa y-asèqwa m6n-l7le hal-""aßêrta} ""u-""èrwe p5šíwa gu-†ùra.} ‘He (the
        shepherd) would go up in the morning (and work) until evening.
        The small cattle would remain in the mountains.’ (B5:158)
  (3)   ""u-napßìwale,} qá-t ""an-rèzza la-páy6š gàwe.} ‘They shook it so that the
        rice did not remain in it.’ (B5:84)
  (4)   b8ya pˆša,} p7ša ""áy ""àxxa,} b-šóp6t bròn6n.} ‘If she wants to stay, let her
        stay here, in place of our son.’ (A4:39)A perfective past form in narrative may express a situation enduring for
a delimited period of time, e.g.
746                             chapter fifteen  (5)   píšla †¬a-yàrxe.} ‘They stayed three months.’ (A14:84)
  (6)   píš5le gu-†úra xá-yoma yóme trè.} ‘He remained in the mountains one
        or two days.’ (A4:2)In narrative the verb is sometimes used with the anaphoric adverbial
had6x ‘like this, thus’ to express a passage of time and a transition between
episodes, e.g.  (7)   šèryela gu-d-7 ""otél ""o-yòma-w} píšela hàd6x.} ""aßèrta °ì°5la} b8yi t-áxli xa-
        ràmša.} ‘They put up in the hotel that day and remained like that.
        The evening came and they wanted to eat dinner.’ (A2:2)
  (8)   ""u-xílela ""áni mêndi-w} sus>wa°éy dèry6lla mèndi ""ixàla.} píšela hàd6x.}
        ""àm6r . . . } xuláma ""ám6r †la-mìra.} ‘They ate something and gave their
        horses some food. They remained like that. The servant said to
        the master . . .’ (A26:17–18)The verb in the q†ille form may express the onset of a situation with no
definite endpoint, which is sequential to a preceding situation, e.g.  (9)  ðá-k°5°a xilàla,} ðá pìšla.} ‘He ate one chicken and one remained.’
       (A2:3)
  (10) hár šèmme píšle ’ùxo.} ‘His name still remained ’uxo (after the
       preceding event).’ (A7:4)When the subject is human, the verb can have the sense of ‘remaining
alive’, e.g.  (11) ""u-xaráye †líba díya q6m-šaqlêxle.} ""áy pìšla.} ‘In the end we took her
       betrothed but she remained alive.’ (A4:45)
  (12) káwa xoš-t-awéwa pìša.} ‘He should have remained alive.’ (A7:20)(ii) Finite inflections of pyš can be combined with an infinitive to express
the uninterrupted continuity of an event or situation over a period of
time, e.g.  (1)   ""o-bróna t-íle zíla ða-bá≥6r xèta,} yá'ni ða-mðìta,} ða-mà°a,} píšle rába
        mparòje,} maßyó°e l-b7°6t bábe dìye.} ‘The son who had gone to another
        town, that is a town, a village, remained watching intently, listening
        (for news) about his father’s family.’ (A18:12)

      weeping and weeping, one day, two, one month.’ (A4:44)
  (3) ""o-píšt5la ""an-d6bbòre} har-zála-w °àya.} ‘The bees continued to go back

  (4) píšla béna gráša kúll6t yóma m6n-d-o-dùša} hál ""aßêrta.} ‘All day they con-
      tinued to draw out that honey, until evening.’ (A14:15)In (5) the infinitive coming after the verb pyš is negated by the negative
copula:  (5) píšla bábe-u yèmme-u xon>wá°a lˆla h>móne.} ‘His father and mother
      and her brothers continued not to believe it.’ (A18:11)It may also be combined with a resultative participle of a stative verb to
express a similar sense, e.g.  (6) ""u-xílela ""ixàla} ""u-píše dmìxe.} ‘They ate food and remained there asleep
      (i.e. they stayed the night there).’ (A15:8)15.8.2. Ingressive
(i) When it has the sense of ‘to become’, it is combined with a complement
expressing an identity or property that is acquired by the subject, e.g.  (1) m-bár †axnìle,} páy6š qàmxa} masqíle bˆ°a.} ‘After they grind it and it
      becomes flour, they take it up to the house.’ (B5:99)
  (2) maštˆwala} qá-t xá‘‘a p7šawa rakìxta.} ‘They would irrigate it so that
      it would become rather soft.’ (B5:76)
  (3) ""ána píšli bàxtux.} ‘I have become your wife.’ (A25:65)
  (4) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘As for the mullah, the pot became the
      mullah’s’. (A5:10)
  (5) Bárw6r píšt5la kúlla m-Záwa l-Xawóra t-là-ma°wa°a.} ‘All of Barwar, from
      the Zab to the Khabur became (a land) without villages.’ (B1:10)When an ingressive pyš is combined with a resultative participle from a
transitive verb, the construction expresses a passive action. This will be
discussed in greater detail in §15.9.3. below, e.g.
748                             chapter fifteen  (6) b-7-šeta píšla Dúre muqyàmta-w} ‘In that year Dure was evacuated.’
      (B1:8)(ii) The verb pyš with an ingressive function can be combined with an
infinitive and have the sense of beginning the action in question, e.g.  (1) ""u-táwra píšle mangóle ""áxxa l-tàmma.} ‘The ox began to limp back and
      forth.’ (A22:3)
  (2) píšt5la mtanóye ða-qêßß6t} †la-qà†u.} ‘She started telling a story to the
      cat’. (A14:2)
  (3) píšela mnáy6lla l-xà-xa.} ‘They began to count them, one by one.’
      (A6:3)
  (4) ""áyya m6škènta píšt5la mxàya} dráya qè†ma gu-réša dìya.} ‘The poor woman
      began to beat (herself ) and put ash on her head.’ (A14:22)(iii) Ingressive pyš is occasionally combined with a perfective verbal form
to convey the sense that the event in question is the final outcome of a
chain of events. This is the case in (1), where it is combined with a per-
fective future qa†6l form:  (1) bas-tàma} qèßß6t dìy6x} ""u-t-xòn6x} p7ša mà†ya} l-xarayú°a dìya.} ‘There your
      story and that of your brother will (finally) reach its end.’ (A8:88)A similar function is sometimes performed by a construction in which pyš is
combined with the resultative participle of a telic intransitive verb, e.g.  (2) tíwela tàma} ""u-xílela ""ixàla} ""u-píše dmìxe.} ‘They sat there, ate food, then
      (in the end) went to sleep.’ (A15:8)(iv) Ingressive pyš is sometimes used in narrative before expressions of
time to mark the beginning of a new episodic section. It may be used to
denote the onset of a point in time, e.g.  (1) píšle yòma} hár wewa-xðàra.} ‘Day came and he was still searching
      about.’ (A14:24)
  (2) píšt5la ""aßêrta.} gu-sá""6t ""èšta ""aßèrta šáwwa gu-gn7°6t yòma,} hóle °éle ’ùxo,}
      xa-bèrra ""èrwe bà°re.} ‘The evening came. At six or seven o’clock in
      the evening, at dusk, ’uxo came, with a flock of sheep following
      him.’ (A7:21)
  (3) píšta mbàdla.} mbádla qìm5le.} ‘Morning came. In the morning he got
      up.’ (A14:66)

subject of the verb. The expression of time may also be a prepositional
phrase, as in (4). Here the grammatical subject of the verb, which is 3fs.,
must be impersonal:  (4) píšla b-lˆle,} sìq5le} l-gàre.} ‘At night he went up onto the roof.’
      (A25:52)The verb pyš may also be used to denote the passage of an interval of time.
In such contexts it has 3ms or 3fs inflection. The time expression appears
not to be construed as the grammatical subject, judging by constructions
such as (7), in which a 3ms. verb is followed by a feminine nominal phrase,
and (8), where a 3fs. verb is followed by a masculine nominal phrase:  (5) píš5le xà-yarxa} málka xzéle xa-xèlma xèna.} ‘A month later the king had
      another dream.’ (A1:9)
  (6) píšle šènne rábe ""árbe xámm6š ""èšš6t šènne la-zìlle.} ‘For many years, four,
      five six years, he did not go there.’ (A18:12)
  (7) píš5le ða-šáb°a xˆta,} ""ám6r †la-báxta . . . ‘A week later, he said to his
      wife . . .’ (A5:8)
  (8) p5šáwa xa-yóma trè,} hál barêzwa.} ‘One or two days would go by until
      it became dry.’ (B5:167)
                  15.9. The Expression of the PassiveVarious constructions are used to express the passive of a transitive
verb.15.9.1. q†il
The dialect exhibits a vestigial use of the past base stem q†il to express a
passive action. This is only used sporadically and is restricted to the 3rd
person. As is the case with the q†ille form, the q†il form expresses a specific
event occurring in the past at a particular point in time, e.g.  (1) mèra prúmu rèše!} ""áwwa prìm réše.} ‘She said “Cut off his head!” He—his
      head was cut off.’ (A24:31)
  (2) bá°6r t-gníw Mar-Qayòma,} q6m-dawríle t9ra.} ‘After (the church of ) St.
      Qayoma was plundered, they closed the door.’ (D2:66)
750                             chapter fifteen  (3) mó°i júlla dìya.} ‘Her clothes were brought.’ (A4:20)
  (4) brátux mù°ya.} ‘Your daughter has been brought back.’ (A29:42)
  (5) ""áy wela-""á-bráta xar7°6t m†úmra gu-Dùre.} ‘That was the last girl who
      was buried in Dure.’ (B1:12)
  (6) ""ína ""an-tre-xéne píšela hál-dan6t t-íxwa ""áxni tàma,} hál-šèt ""álpa ""6óóá-mma-
      w šáwwi tmànya,} ""íman t-moqìma Dúre.} ‘But the other two remained
      until the time that we were there, until the year 1978, when Dure
      was evacuated.’ (B1:5)There are other signs of the fossilization of this construction in addition
to the extreme infrequency of its use. The 3ms. form q†il can be used also
with 3fs. and 3pl. nominal subjects:  gaw‰a q†il                ‘The man was killed’
  baxta q†ila ~ q†il        ‘The woman was killed’
  naše q†ili ~ q†il         ‘The people were killed’Example from the text corpus:  (7) prim-""êrwe.} ‘Sheep were slaughtered.’ (B10:40)If the agent of the action is expressed in the clause by a nominal phrase,
this is not necessarily introduced by any preposition, e.g.  (8) mú°y6lla qaráw6t dìya} mùtt6lla.} b7°a dwìq} qaráw6t dìya.} ‘They brought
      her bed and laid it down. The house was filled by her bed.’
      (A21:7)Both these features reflect a certain degree of opacity regarding the status
of the patient argument as the grammatical subject of the verb. Lack of
agreement of a verb with its grammatical subject would not in principle
be possible elsewhere in the verbal system, but lack of agreement with
a grammatical object would be permissible, especially with indefinite
nominals as in (7). The lack of the preposition on the agent nominal in
examples such as (8) is a property of a grammatical subject, suggesting
that it is competing for this status with the patient nominal.

As has been discussed in §15.4.1.1., the resultative participle of a transi-
tive verb combined with the copula, or with the suppletive verb hwy, can
express the passive. It denotes the result of a past verbal event without
referring directly to any specific event that brought about this result. The
construction has an inherent ambiguity in that in many contexts the par-
ticiple may have a dynamic verbal interpretation or a stative adjectival
interpretation, e.g.  (1)   xuwwe q†ìl5le!} ‘The snake has been killed / the snake is killed!’
        (A24:42)
  (2)   ""án baxtá°a barzanáye mêra} kˆla ""an-gúre xéne?} mère kúlla hóla q†ìle.} ‘The
        Barzan women said “Where are the other men?” He said “They
        have all been killed / They are all killed.” ’ (B19:8)
  (3)   bróni hóle xíla ""6dlˆle.} ‘My son has been eaten tonight.’ (A18:2)
  (4)   yába ‘ídetu xlúl6 bròn-fèll6n b-flàn-yoma.} ‘You have been invited / you
        are invited to the wedding of the son of so-and-so on such-and-
        such a day.’ (B5:21)
  (5)   kúl má°a t-íla tlíxta ""í° ""ùmra gáwa.} ‘Every village that has been / is
        destroyed and has a church in it’ (B6:34)
  (6)   párša t-wéwa mútta b-r6š-Xuldêkka.} ‘A flat stone that had been placed /
        was placed on top of Xuld6kko’ (A51:20)The agent may be expressed in such passive resultative constructions. This
is usually marked by the preposition l-, e.g.  (7)  ""6n-réš6t bábe díye ""ax-†ùra,} ""u-hóle q†íla l-T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi,} lˆka
       bt-áz6l?} ‘If the head of his father is like a mountain and he has been
       killed by T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi, where will he go?’ (A28:8)
  (8) šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwa.} ‘The seven of them have been eaten by
       wolves.’ (A23:15)
  (9) xabúša smóqa l-dêbb5le xíla.} ‘The red apple has been eaten by the
       bear.’ (D2:65)
  (10) nísa l-xúwwe m-xàwla ßádle.} ‘He who has been bitten by a snake is
       afraid of a rope.’ (D2:39)
  (11) ‘íd6t l-bràtux.} ‘You have been invited by your daughter.’ (A40:12)
  (12) xá°ux Nasímo jlíwt5la l-""arabàye.} ‘Your sister Nasimo has been kid-
       napped by Arabs.’ (A37:5)
752                            chapter fifteen  (13) mxuzd5w6n l-Tom6n xali. ‘I have been shamed by Toman my uncle.’
       (A52:4)On fronted agents in focus bearing the nuclear stress the preposition is
sometimes omitted, which results in an opacity of coding, in that both
the patient nominal and the agent nominal have the coding appropriate
for the grammatical subject, e.g.  (14) ""áyya yalêxta} bàbila zqírta} ""u-xá°i Nasìmola mnuqášta.} ‘This hand-
       kerchief was woven by my father and embroidered by my sister
       Nasimo.’ (A37:12)15.9.3. Resultative Participle Combined with pyš
The most productive means of forming the passive of a transitive verb is
by combining a form of the verb pyš with the resultative participle. The
tense and aspect of the construction are determined by the form of pyš.
It is frequently used in historical narratives with a perfective aspect to
refer to a specific event in the past. In such cases the verb pyš is in the
q†ille form or the q†il5l5 form, which here is used in its narrative sense of
a preterite equivalent to q†ille, e.g.  (1)   rába m6n-d-ánna ma°wà°a} píšla prìme} . . . píšla q†ìle.} ""u-píšla mšuxèlpe
        ma°wá°6t qurðáye muš6lmàne.} ‘Many (of the inhabitants of) these
        villages were slaughtered. . . . They were killed. They (the villages)
        were then changed into Muslim Kurdish villages.’ (B1:2)
  (2)   b-7-šeta píšla Dúre muqyàmta-w} kúlla má°wa°6t Bˆrw6r,} sáma zóda
        t-ma°wà°a,} píšla moqìme,} ""u-tlìxe,} ""umráne tlìxe,} ""u-bustanáne mùqðe,}
        ""u-má°a šwíqta x>ràba-w} náše †rìðe.} ‘In that year Dure was evacuated.
        All the villages of Barwar, or most of the villages, were evacuated
        and destroyed. The churches were destroyed, the orchards were
        burnt, the village was left a ruin and the people were driven away.’
        (B1:8)
  (3)   ""í°wal6n šawwá ""abòne} gu-má°a dìy6n.} píšela mútte gu-Mar-Qayyóma kúlla
        gu-ðà qáwra.} ‘We had seven bishops in our village. They were all
        laid in one grave in (the church of) Saint Qayyoma.’ (B2:6)If a nominal expressing the agent is mentioned in the clause it is intro-
duced by the preposition l-, e.g.
                            the syntax of verbs                              753  (4) ""u-Dùre} píšt5la muqyàmta} muxràwta} šawwà gáye} l-xànpe} qa†òle}
      t-muš6lmàne.} ‘Dure was evacuated and destroyed seven times by
      pagan murderers of Muslims.’ (B2:2)Constructions with a past perfective of pyš such as pišle q†ila or its equiva-
lent in narrative piš5le q†ila correspond in function to the obsolescent q†il
form.
   In (5) the resultative participle of pyš is combined with the past copula:  (5) ""éða gó‰a ""íle xa-†ùxsa} qyámt6t Mšíxa bá°6r t-wéwa píša q†ìla.} ‘The Great
      Festival is a ceremony (commemorating) the resurrection of Christ
      after he had been killed.’ (B6:1)In (6) a future form of pyš is used, in (7)–(8) an irrealis form and in (9) a
past habitual form:  (6) kú nêšma} t-mà†ya} r6š-gèšr6t Dalàle} ""5-nèšma b6d-pˆša} prìmta,} q†ìlta.}
      ‘Any soul that comes onto the bridge of Dalale—that soul will be
      slaughtered, killed.’ (C8:5)
  (7) yába ""ána t-à°6n,} ""áx‘i ""6n-yáwul Ä>m?n} š∞x} ""áwwa †éni páy6š n†ìra} ta-
      t-‘ú-mdi là-""a°e bíye dìye.} ‘Well, I’ll come, only if the sheikh gives a
      guarantee that this saddle bag will be guarded so that nothing will
      happen to it.’ (A7:9)
  (8) kúl-xa náša . . . yalúnka zór6t bàre} g8r6g páy6š m5mèðða gu-""ùmra.} ‘Every-
      body . . . when a young child is born, he must be baptized in the
      church.’ (B6:9)
  (9) hadíya mtánexi xa-tuní°a ""atìqta} p5šáwa mtun7°a gu-ma°wà°a.} ‘Now we
      shall tell an old story, which used to be told in the villages.’Constructions with the resultative forms of pyš such as hole piša q†ila / piš5le
q†ila ‘He has been killed / He is killed’ and piš5wa q†ila ‘He had been killed /
He was killed’ are equivalent in function to the passive resultative forms
hole q†ila / q†il5le and q†il5wa. The difference is that forms with pyš can only
function as passives whereas the forms with the copula could in principle
have a passive or active interpretation according to context. Speakers use
the constructions with pyš to eliminate this opacity of diathesis. In (10)
the motivation for using the unambiguously passive form pišewa ‘ide may
have been to distinguish it clearly from the active form ‘5diwaley in the
immediately preceding discourse:
754                             chapter fifteen  (10) kúlla ma°wá°a ‘5dìwaley.} m6n-kúlla ma°wá°6 t-íla marzabán6t ""Ón-Nùne,}
       xa-tmánya ""6ßrà-ma°wa°a} náše píšewa ‘ìde.} ‘They invited all the vil-
       lages. From all the villages that were adjacent to ""“n-Nune, eight
       or ten villages, the people were invited.’ (B15:61)Occasionally pyš is used with the resultative participle of intransitive verbs.
Such constructions are used to convey the sense that the subject refer-
ent is non-volitional and the event is caused to take place by an external
agent. This is in conformity with the pyš q†ila passive construction, which
in principle has a non-volitional subject who is the undergoer of the
action. In (11), for example, the construction pišla riqe is used to express
the fact that the inhabitants of the villages were forced to flee against their
will. The ‘active’ form riqla ‘they fled’, by contrast, would in principle be
interpreted as having a volitional subject.  (11) rába m6n-d-ánna ma°wà°a} píšla prìme} ""u-xákma píšla rìqe-u} píšla q†ìle.}
       ‘Many (of the inhabitants of ) these villages were slaughtered. Some
       (were forced to) flee and were killed.’ (B1:2)15.9.4. Resultative Participle Combined with ""°y
On some sporadic occasions the passive is expressed by a construction
consisting of a finite form of the verb ""°y ‘to come’ with the undergoer
as subject and a resultative participle, e.g.  (1)   b-r6š-d-àyya bráta} réš6t bábe díye t-Zàlo} °éle twíra ràbe gáye.} ‘On account
        of this girl, the head of his father Zàl was broken many times.’
        (A29:39)15.9.5. Infinitive Combined with ""°y
In another type of periphrastic construction the verb ""°y ‘to come’ is
combined with the infinitive of the verbal stem that expresses the action.
This construction is of more restricted use than that the pyš + resultative
participle construction. In most of the recorded examples the verb is
negated. The infinitive may be preceded by the preposition l-, e.g.  (1)   har-Dúre lˆ-""a°ya l-manšóye.} ‘Dure will never be forgotten.’ (B2:7)
  (2)   ""u-hál hadíya ""áwwa m6ndiyáne píšela l-bàl6n} ""u-lˆ-""a°i l-manšóye.} ‘Until
        now these things remain in my mind and will not be forgotten.’

      that this head of mine will one day be cut off by your hands.’
      (A14:35)The construction may be used deontically to express deontic possibility

Numerous verbal forms exhibit an alternation of transitive and unaccu-
sative intransitive usage. These can be used transitively with a volitional
subject and an object complement that is the undergoer of the action or
alternatively can be used intransitively with the non-volitional undergoer
being made the grammatical subject. They are found in all verb stems
(for a set of such verbs in stem III see §8.17.2.).
   The translation equivalent in English may be a verb that exhibits a
similar alternation, e.g.     ""áw šmí†le kupàle.} ‘He broke his stick.’
     ""o-kupála šmì†le.} ‘The stick broke.’
     ""áw ßlíxle qˆsa.} ‘He split the wood.’
     ""o-q7sa ßlìxle.} ‘The wood split.’
     núra q6m-qaméla ßùdri.} ‘The fire scorched my shirt.’
     ßúdri qmèla.} ‘My shirt scorched.’
756                            chapter fifteen      ""áni q6m-xanqìle.} ‘They drowned him.’
      ""áw xnìqle.} ‘He drowned.’
      ""áw mkuwèrre ""9raq} ‘He distilled arak’
      ""8raq mkuwêrra.} ‘The arak distilled.’
      ""áw mukíšle gùða.} ‘He deflated the skin.’
      gúða mukìšle.} ‘The skin deflated.’In some cases the transitive alternative must be translated by supplying
the matrix verb ‘to cause’ or a different lexical item, e.g.      ""áw mujrè†le yàla.} ‘He caused the child to slip.’
      ""o-yála mujrê†le.} ‘The child slipped.’
      ""áw †ríxle nàša.} ‘He caused the man to lie flat.’
      ""o-náša †rìxle.} ‘The man lay down flat.’
      ""áw tlíxle bˆ°a.} ‘He destroyed the house.’
      ""o-b7°a tlìxle.} ‘The house collapsed.’In many cases an unaccusative intransitive alternative of a transitive
verb is rendered idiomatically by an English passive. This applies, for
example, to the verbs q†a""a ‘to cut’, šqala ‘to take’, which are normally
used transitively:  (1) m6n-êdyo} malkù°a} m-bnónux q9†a.} ‘From today the kingship will be
      cut off from your sons.’ (A8:96)
  (2) mðíta b>yènna mbádla jálde kúlla ""ax-qamàye,} muxwàrta.} ""áwwa kóma šàq6l.}
      ‘(By) early morning I want all the town as (it was) before, made
      white. Let the black be taken away.’ (A4:34)Numerous other verbs exhibit this alternation, e.g.      g6lyále duzù°a.} ‘He revealed the truth.’
      duzú°a glèla.} ‘The truth was revealed.’
      páwxa q6m-mbalbèlle kàwse.} ‘The wind ruffled his hair.’
      káwse mbulbèlle qam-pàwxa.} ‘His hair was ruffled by the wind.’
      máw°6t mámi q6m-mzarzèli.} ‘The death of my uncle shook me.’
      mzurzèli.} ‘I was shaken.’

      gèšra q†êrre.} ‘The arch of the bridge was completed.’
      ß†imlux bˆ°i.} ‘You have devastated my house.’
      ""ána ß†ìmli.} ‘I am devastated.’
      burb6zíli zùze.} ‘I scattered the money.’
      zúze burbêzla.} ‘The money was scattered.’
      q6m-mxa°xè°la x6zmayù°a.} ‘He renewed the family relationship.’
      x6zmayú°a mxu°xêtla.} ‘The family relationship was renewed.’The alternations described above are not restricted to past pefective forms,
as in the examples above, but apply also to forms with present or future
time reference and imperfective aspect.
   Even when an unaccusative intransitive usage is available, a transitive
verb is sometimes made intransitive by the pyš q†ila construction, e.g.   (3) ""ína kupáli píšla šmì††a} ""u-piláwe píšla šmì†e.} ‘But my staff has broken
       and my shoes have broken.’ (A37:17)15.9.7. Diathesis of Causative Verbs
Causative forms of transitive verbs exhibit alternating diathesis. These
may either take as their grammatical object the agent of the action that
is being caused with the undergoer expressed as a second object or alter-
natively may take the undergoer of the action as the only grammatical
object, e.g.q†ala ‘to kill’:     maq†ole ‘to cause to kill’   (1) q6m-maq†èlli xàwri.} ‘He [AGENT1] caused me [AGENT2] to kill my
       friend [UNDERGOER].’
   (2) q6m-maq†èlle xàwri.} ‘He [AGENT1] caused my friend [UNDER-
       GOER] to be killed.’When the grammatical object is the undergoer, as in (2), the caused action
is presented with passive diathesis. The agent who is caused to perform
the action need not be specified. If it is specified, it must be expressed
in a prepositional phrase, as is the case in (4), unless it is a reflexive con-
struction (5):
758                                chapter fifteen  (3) bàxta} be-b9x6t-ila.} maq6†làle gáw‰a.} ‘A woman is treacherous. She will
      cause her husband to be killed.’ (A26:2)
  (4) ""áwwa náša sáwa †la-mó q6m-maq6†lètle bìyi?} ‘Why did you cause that
      old man to be killed by me?’ (A15:18)
  (5) tre-†¬á-gaye mamxêxwala gán6n.} ‘We used to cause ourselves to be struck
      two or three times.’ (B5:84)15.9.8. Diathesis of Infinitives
An infinitive of a transitive verb that is subordinate to a matrix verb can
have active or passive diathesis. Examples of infinitives presented with
passive diathesis are (1)–(4), in which the agents of the action denoted by
the infinitive are not specified:  (1) °í°5la xa-bràta} mxáya ßáwla díya darmàna.} ‘A girl came in order for
      her shoes to be rubbed with polish.’ (A16:2)
  (2) muttúla ""ixála xàla.} ‘They served food to be eaten.’ (A15:11)
  (3) ""áni kúlla b>yíwa maxóle ""u-maštòye.} ‘They all needed to be fed and
      given drink.’ (B16:62)
  (4) ""u-l5w6x naše t-manxope. ‘We are not people to be shamed.’ (C1:14)15.9.9. Impersonal 3pl. Subject
When the agent of a transitive action is not specified, an active verb may
be given a 3pl. impersonal subject. Such constructions are often translated
idiomatically into English as passives, e.g.  (1) q6m-†arðíli m6n-bˆ°a.} ‘They drove me from the house = I was driven
      from the house.’
  (2) gu-Zàxo} bnáya w7wa xa-gêšra.} ‘In Zakho they were building a bridge
      (= a bridge was being built).’ (C8:1–2)
  (3) ""u-har-b6nyàla xá-gaya xéta.} ‘They have already built it (the village of
      Dure) again (= It has already been built again).’ (B2:7)
  (4) Qa†ina x6tn5le t-la-mbarxile. ‘Qa†ina is a groom without them wedding
      him (= without being wed).’ (A50:15)
  (5) be-palge sarxi d6mma. ‘They defile its middle with blood (= Its middle
      is defiled by blood).’ (A52:22)This use of an impersonal 3pl. subject is common in naming expressions
with the verb ""mr ‘to say’, e.g.

      house of H5do.’ (B4:7)
         15.10. Verbal Constructions with the Particle HEŠ15.10.1. heš in Positive Clauses
The particle heš, which is of Kurdish origin, is used to modify the verbal
predicate in various ways. In positive clauses heš is used with the sense of
‘still’, expressing the persistence of an enduring situation. The form of
the verb is one that can express such a situation, e.g.  (1) ""áy heš-hóla gu-gòma.} ‘She is still in the basement stable.’ (A18:22)
  (2) héš xúya xùy5le.} ‘It is still very dark.’ (A30:36)
  (3) heš-hóle plàxa.} ‘He is still working.’
  (4) heš-hóle dmìxa.} ‘He is still asleep’.
  (5) heš-máße jàw6j.} ‘He can still move.’It may also be used with a verb expressing the persistence of an iterative
situation, e.g.  (6) ""áw náša sàw5le,} bás heš-y-áz6l šúla kùt-yum.} ‘He is an old man, but
      he still goes to work every day’.15.10.2. heš + Negator
When the particle heš precedes a negator, the construction denotes the
persistence of a negated situation and the sense of ‘not yet’. This is in
principle used with the negative copula or with a negated form of a verb
that expresses an enduring or iterative situation. These are most commonly
compound constructions with the resultative participle or infinitive, all of
which express an enduring negated situation. It is generally cliticized to
the negator and is often contracted to the form š-, e.g.  (1) heš-l7le làxxa.} ‘He is not here yet.’
  (2) heš-l7le ""ê°ya.} ‘He has not come yet.’
  (3) xalwála-w ""ap-xá‘‘a xéna šóqa †la-mòja.} qá-t ""ap-""áw zòr5le,} sab-qá-t š-l7wa
      mšúrya xála gêlla.} ‘Then she milks it and leaves a little more for the
      calf. This is because it is small and had not yet started to eat grass.’
      (B5:175)
760                             chapter fifteen  (4) ""è°y5la ""àrye.} ""ê°ye,} ""ê°ye,} š-l7wa mè†ye ""6lle-dìye.} ‘The lions came. They
      came, but they had not yet reached him.’ (A18:26)It may be used with infinitive constructions in subordinate clauses that
lack the copula. In such cases the infinitive is often negated by the particle
t-la ‘without’, e.g.  (5) q6m-dári ""an-dáwwe heš-t-là bráza.} ‘They have poured out the dawwe
      while it is not yet dry.’ (B14:1)
  (6) l7ðeti ""àyya} t-íla m6n-hèš t-la-bràya} ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi?} ‘Don’t you
      know that she has been betrothed to me since before she was born?’
      (A25:39)
  (7) š-lá-praqa ""o-pék dìye} ""o-xáwri hád6x gabbàra,} xáz6x wírre gawàye.} ‘Before
      my friend, a huge man, had finished his measure (of whiskey), we
      saw him go inside.’ (B15:58)15.10.3. Negator + heš
When the negator precedes the particle, it has the sense of ‘no longer’,
in that it expresses the end of an enduring or iterative situation that was
previously in existence. It is attested with qa†6l base forms expressing the
end of an iterative situation in the future. The sequence la-heš generally
contracts to leš, l5š, laš or l6š, e.g.  (1) léš-""a°6x hayorêxlux.} ‘We shall no longer come to help you.’ (A48:6)
  (2) qìm5le,} mêÄya} ""u-wíða tawq≈' ""u-kúl m6ndì,} qá-t ""áyya leš-dáre bas-dìya.}
      ‘He signed and authorized it, and so forth, (pledging) that he would
      never again talk about it.’ (A8:97)
  (3) leš-faydál6x qá†l6t gàn6x.} ‘It will no longer be of any use to you to kill
      yourself.’ (A38:16)It is found with the qa†6l form of the verb mßy ‘to be able’, used with
habitual aspect and with future reference, e.g.  (4) sab-""6n-wèle šxánta ràba,} léš-maß6t ""atw6t †¬a°à-metre} rè˙qa m6n-ßùpa.} ‘For
      if it has become very hot, you can no longer sit three metres from
      the stove.’ (B15:25)
  (5) léš-maße-náša palè†le qále dìye.} ‘A person can no longer utter his voice.’
      (B15:39)
  (6) ""áql6t sus7xu ""6n-píšla kèpa,} léš maßítu jawjìtu.} ‘If the legs of your horses
      have become stone, you will no longer be able to move.’ (A8:28)

inserted between the negator la and the copula, viz. la-heš-ile, e.g.  (7)   léš-ile gu-bˆ°a.} ‘He is no longer in the house.’In the text corpus this is attested in compound verbal forms consisting of
the copula and the resultative participle or infinitive, e.g.  (8)  mo-t-àw6ð?} léš-ile mêßya.} ‘What can he do? He can no longer do
       anything.’ (A8:96)
  (9) l7š-in xzàya,} lán-mßaya jwàja.} ‘I can no longer see and I cannot
       walk.’ (A24:2)
  (10) láš-it ðà""6lli?} ‘Don’t you know me any more?’ (A12:65)
  (11) láš-iyewa mßáya x9yewa.} ‘He could no longer make a living.’
       (A30:1)In (12) the particle is used in a compound infinitive construction in which
the copula has been omitted:  (12) léš-awwa mßáya má†e ‘ù-duk°a.} ‘He can no longer reach any place.’
       (A37:14)
         15.11. Verbal Constructions with the Particle HARThe particle har is combined with verbs to perform numerous functions.
These functions can be classified broadly into two opposing semantic
domains, viz. extension and narrowing.","[784, 785, 786, 787, 788, 789, 790, 791, 792, 793, 794, 795, 796, 797, 798, 799, 800]"
"15.3.1.1. Enclitic Copula Attached to the Predicate
The enclitic copula attached to the predicate may be regarded as the
functionally unmarked form of the basic copula. It is used irrespective
of the time stability of the predicate. The predicate may express a per-
manent property of the subject, e.g. brónux spày-ile} ‘Your son is good’. It
may identify the referent of the subject with that of the nominal of the
predicate, which is typically a permanent relationship, e.g. "">wáha gáw‰a
bròn6n-ile} ‘That man is our son’. The predicate may also express a contin-
                            the syntax of verbs                          623gent situation that is not necessarily a permanent property of the subject,
e.g. brónux kpìn5le} ‘Your son is hungry’. Examples from the text corpus:  (1)   ""á°‰a rába basìm5le.} ‘The country is very beautiful.’ (B5:148)
  (2)   ""ána †axàn5w6n.} ‘I am a miller.’ (A32:10)
  (3)   bráta zamàrt5la.} ‘The girl is a singer.’ (A25:68)
  (4)   hadíya ""áti màlk6n-it} ‘Now you are our king.’ (A14:46)
  (5)   ßíw6n dìy6n-ile.} ‘It is our border.’ (A14:48)
  (6)   ""ána 'Abda-Ra˙m?n-iw6n.} ‘I am Abda Ra˙màn.’ (A23:26)
  (7)   rába k‘ìx5w6n.} ‘I am very tired.’ (A18:32)
  (8)   xòðiw6n.} ‘I am by myself.’ (A22:32)
  (9)   ‘íd5w6t ""aßèrta †la-xa-ràmša.} ‘You are invited in the evening to din-
        ner.’ (A22:17)The predicate may be combined with the particles heš ‘still’ and har ‘already,
still’, which demonstrate that the situation is not permanent, implying an
end-point or starting-point, e.g.  (10) brónux héš kpìn5le.} ‘Your son is still hungry.’
  (11) brónux hár kpìn5le.} ‘Your son is already hungry.’
  (12) ""áw héš màlk5le.} ‘He is still king.’
  (13) ""áw hár màlk5le.} ‘He is already king.’When expressing a contingent situation the enclitic copula is occasionally
combined with the deictic copula, e.g.  (14) hóle qúrb6t nùr5le.} ‘He is near to the fire.’ (A23:9)It is unmarked with regard to the referential nature of the subject argu-
ment, in that it is used both with subjects that have a specific referent, as
is the case in examples adduced so far, and also with those that denote a
generic class, as in (15)–(16):  (15) gilándi rába gò‰5le.} ‘The scythe is very big.’ (B5:143)
  (16) jawètta t-prêzl5la.} ‘The sickle is made of iron.’ (B5:140)The construction exhibits functional unmarkedness with regard to the topi-
cal status of the subject. The subject is normally definite, i.e. its referent
is identifiable, but there is no restriction on the topicality of the subject
referent. The topicality of this referent depends on the degree to which it
624                           chapter fifteenhas been evoked in the immediately preceding discourse or in the speech
situation. If it has been explicity mentioned in the immediately preceding
discourse, it is high in topicality, e.g.  (17) ""ána xzéli brònux.} brónux spày-ile.} ‘I have seen your son. Your son is
       good.’Such nominals can be pronominalized, e.g.  (18) ""ána xzéli brònux.} ""áw spày-ile.} ‘I have seen your son. He is good.’A nominal may also be definite, with an identifiable referent, by virtue of
the fact that it is anchored to the preceding discourse by a some element
within it, such as a pronominal suffix or an annexed noun with a referent
that has been evoked previously, although the referent of the nominal itself
has not been evoked. In such cases the nominal is lower in topicality and
cannot be pronominalized, e.g.  (19) kut-šéta y-áz6n l-mà°a.} náš6t má°a spày-ila.} yawíli féke m6n-k5rmàne.}
       ‘Every year I go to the village. The people of the village are good.
       They give me fruit from the orchards.’A nominal may also be definite by virtue of the fact that it is inferable as
being a component associated with the situation evoked in the preceding
discourse, although it is not specifically mentioned in it. Also in such cases
it is lower in topicality, arguably lower even than when anchored, and
cannot be pronominalized, e.g.  (20) kut-šéta y-áz6n l-mà°a.} náše spày-ila.} yawíli féke m6n-k5rmàne.} ‘Every
       year I go to the village. The people are good. They give me fruit
       from the orchards.’This topicality scale of definite nominals may be summarzied by the
following hierarchy, in which the symbol > denotes ‘of higher topicality
than’:  Explicitly mentioned > Anchored > InferableFirst and second person pronouns are high in topicality by virtue of the
fact that their referents are given in the speech situation, e.g.
                             the syntax of verbs                               625  (21) ""ána spày-iw6n.} ‘I am good.’
  (22) ""áti spày-iw6t.} ‘You are good.’It can be seen, therefore, that the construction in which the enclitic copula
is attached to the predicate is used irrespective of the topicality of the
subject nominal.
   The construction is also unmarked with regard to the communicative
salience of the proposition of the clause as a whole. This is reflected by
its usage irrespective of the factivity of the proposition. It is used both
in factive and non-factive propositions. Clauses expressing assertive, fac-
tive propositions are high in communicative salience in that the speaker
is committed to its factuality. Non-factive propositions do not involve
such commitment and are low in communicative salience. This applies,
for example, to interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is being
questioned, e.g.  (23) bróne díye spày-ile} ‘His son is good’
  (24) bróne díye spày-ile?} ‘Is his son good?’The present enclitic copula sometimes has a past tense reference in clauses
that are syntactically subordinated to or closely associated with a clause
with a past verb form, e.g.","[661, 662, 663, 664]"

"15.13.5. The Distribution of Compound Verbal Forms with ‘Heavy’ Pronominal
Objects
As remarked above (§15.13.1.), compound verbal forms express the pro-
nominal object by L-suffixes or by pronominal suffixes attached to the
longer preposition ""6ll-. This is obligatory when the form does not have a
copula enclitic but optional when there is a copula enclitic. When an ""6ll-
phrase is used with a form that has a copula enclitic, the form is longer
than one with an L-suffix. Most examples of such ""6ll- phrases combined
with copula enclitics that are attested in the text corpus occur with 3rd
person copula elements and their position is before the copula.
                              the syntax of verbs                                  783   The ""6ll- + enclitic copula construction does not appear to be used
totally randomly. An examination of the contexts in which it occurs shows
that there is a clear tendency for it to be used at the end of a chain of
clauses. It marks the boundary of a closely knit series of actions that are
presented as a single overall event. This use of the construction to mark
an end boundary in a span of discourse probably arises from the fact that
it has a heavier morphological weight than the corresponding construction
consisting of the enclitic copula + L-suffix.
   The following examples are from narrative texts:  (1) mêxy6llux, [Cop.—L-suffix]} mêxy6llux, [Cop.—L-suffix]} mêxy6llux

      and eat him, (and wait) until the bear goes away from there.” ’ They
      got up and slaughtered the young one and ate it.’ (A20:7–8)
  (6) ""ám6r ""ána 'Abda-Ra˙m?n-iw6n,} p°úx t9ra!} p°ìx6llele [""6ll-phrase—Cop.]
      t8ra.} ‘He said “I am 'Abda-Ra˙màn, open the door!” and he opened
      the door.’ (A23:26)In (7) below, the ""6ll-phrase—Cop. construction p°ìxt6llela t8ra ‘She opened
the door’ is in close sequence to the preceding clause máx5 l-t9ra ‘They
knock on the door’. There then follows a chain of clauses beginning
with a Cop.—L-suffix construction repeating a reference to the opening
of the door: p°íxt6lle t9ra. The objective meaning of the two references
to the opening of the door is clearly the same. The use of the different
constructions arises from the choice of the speaker as to how to present
784                             chapter fifteenthe relationship between events. The first sequence ends with the opening
of the door. The second sequence begins with the opening of the door.  (7) ""áy hóla wáða kùbbe.} hóla ""i°á°a gu-lˆša,} lyáša kùbbe,} ""u-""ê°y5le} bába dìya}

      They knocked on the door and, while her hands were (covered in)
      flour, she opened the door. She opened the door and saw her father
      and also the vizier who was with him.’ (A21:26)Forms with an ""6ll- phrase placed after a 1st or 2nd person copula clitic
are less frequently attested in the text corpus. They are generally used with
the same function as ‘heavy’ boundary markers. In (8) the form occurs at
the end of each of the series of discrete events that are described by the
speaker. In (9) the form, likewise, is used at the end of a series of clauses
that the speaker presents as closely-knit aspects of one overall event:  (8) ""í°wa xa-†úr6t skinyà°a.} mutt7°6twa qámi xa-†úr6t skinyà°a.} ""áw pìð6n-

On some sporadic occasions the direct object nominal has prefixed to it
the preposition qa-, †la- or l-, which are normally used before nouns to
express a dative relation. In the available examples, the preposition qa-
is used before definite objects without an agreement pronoun on the
verb, e.g.

        reject the white milk (of my mother)?’
  (8)   m8x6b qa-bábux ""u-yêmmux!} ‘Love your father and mother!’The preposition †la-/ta- is attested before definite direct objects and is in
some cases accompanied by an agreement pronoun on the verb, e.g.  (9)  taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo.} ‘I remember the wedding of Š6mmo
       my brother.’ (B8:21)
  (10) ""6n-""ána hawènwa q†íl6lla "">yáha ""aqêrwa,} ""áwwa xúwwe t-awéwa q†íla
       †la-bròni.} ‘If I had killed that scorpion, that snake would have
       killed my son.’ (A9:6)
  (11) ""áwwa q†ìlle †la-""árya.} ‘He killed the lion.’ (A11:1)

  (13) díya ""áwwa b8ye ta-d-áyya bráta zùrta.} ‘Now he loves this young girl.’
       (A14:83)
  (14) zarqèxwa †la-mèzze max-ßoßì°a.} ‘We used to weave the hairs like a
       plait.’The preposition l- is rarely used as a direct object marker on a nominal.
An isolated example in the text corpus is (15):  (15) ˙átta l-""umràne-≥ig6n} tlìx6lla.} ‘He destroyed even the churches.’
       (B2:2)15.13.7. Double Objects
The verbs ""wð ‘to do, to make’, á¬y ‘to fill’, dwq ‘to fill, pack’ and certain
causative verbs may take two direct objects, e.g.
786                           chapter fifteen  (1)  y-oðíwale pùwuš.} j>míwale y-oðíwale qàpla.} ‘They made it into hay.
       They gathered it and made it into an armful.’ (B5:84)
  (2) y-oðále zeðàye.} . . . y-oðále guttá°a qamàye.} ‘She makes it into pitta
       breads. . . . First she makes into balls.’ (B5:101)

  (4) ""u-áá¬6xxa ‘ántux zùze.} ‘We shall fill your bag with money.’
       (A39:14)
  (5) ‘ánte díye dwíqla zwàðe.} ‘She packed his bag with provisions.’
       (A21:22)
  (6) malw6šíwale jull-dìye} ‘They would dress him in his clothes.’
       (B5:26)
  (7) max6ðríla ""a-k yàlo.} ‘They caused the bride to go around (the village).’
       (B5:38)
  (8) madoqíla xètna-w k yálo gota-©ðàðe.} ‘They make the groom and bride

  (9) ""èdyo maštènn5xu št7°a dìy6n} t-in-wíð6lla ""àna.} ‘Today I shall give you
       our drink to drink, which I have made.’ (B15:57)
  (10) hátxa m>l6pètli ˙aqqú°a ""u-na-˙aqqù°a.} ‘You should teach me what is
       lawful and what is unlawful.’ (A15:10)
                         15.14. Indirect ObjectsA nominal that has the function of the indirect object of an action, i.e.
one that refers to a participant who is a recipient or beneficiary in the
action, is expressed by attaching the preposition †la-/ta- or qa-. Unlike
direct object nominals, indirect object nominals normally do not have
any agreement element in the form of a pronominal copy on the verb,
even when the noun is definite, e.g.  (1)   ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l têrte tawriyá°a.} ‘He will give to your neighbour
        two cows.’ (A3:4)
  (2)   tèmm6l t-ámr6n ta-bàbi.} ‘Tomorrow I shall tell my father.’ (A18:7)
  (3)   mèrt5la †la-d-áw-naša sáwa puš-b-šˆna!} ‘She said to that old man
        “Remain in peace!” ’ (A8:69)On some rare occasions an agreement L-suffix is attested on the verb,
e.g.  (4)   ""ána t-àz6n} tanyánne ða-tuní°a †la-màlka.} ‘I shall go and tell a story
        to the king.’ (A36:2)
                             the syntax of verbs                                787As already described in §8.19.5., a pronominal indirect object of a verb
may be expressed by an L-suffix or by an independent prepositional phrase
consisting of the prepositions ""6ll-, †la- or qa- and a pronominal suffix. With
past base verbs the pronominal indirect object may also be expressed by
the inflection of the past base, e.g. mirále ‘He said to her’. Here we shall
examine in greater detail the distribution of these alternative devices in
the text corpus.
   When there is no direct object, the pronominal indirect object may
usually be expressed either by an L-suffix or by an independent preposi-
tional phrase. In such cases the ‘heavier’ prepositional phrase tends to be
used at the end of an intonation group (7–9) and avoided in the middle
of an intonation group following the verb (5–6). Included here are verbs
of saying followed by direct or indirect speech:  (5)   ""álaha yállux b-àyya dúnye} ""u-b-5-xèta.} ‘May God grant you (bounty)
        in this world and the next.’ (A21:44)
  (6)   xáli lá ""amrètli qèßß6t d-áwwa qáßra mòdila?} ‘Uncle, will you not tell
        me what the story of this palace is?’ (A25:67)
  (7)   ""ám6r ""èlle dìye.} ‘He says to him.’ (A21:2)
  (8)   t-ámreti †làli.} ‘Tell me.’ (A21:43)
  (9)   ""ána mar6n-êllux.} ‘I say to you.’ (A17:34)A compound verbal form consisting of a resultative participle or an
infinitive without a clitic copula never takes L-suffixes. It usually takes a
cliticized ""6ll-phrase, e.g. hon híw6lle ‘I have given to him’, hon yaw6lle ‘I am
giving to him’. At the end of an intonation group this may be replaced
by an independent prepositional phrase with its own stress, e.g.  (10) hóle mára †làli.} ‘He says to me.’ (A17:10)
  (11) ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi.} ‘She has been given to me.’ (A25:39)When the verb has both a pronominal direct object and a pronominal
indirect object, the direct object is normally the primary object affix on
the verb and the indirect object is expressed by a prepositional adjunct
phrase, which in most cases follows the direct object affix, e.g.  (12) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""èlle dìye.} ‘Let’s look for a
       man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
  (13) ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)
788                            chapter fifteen  (14) á¬óla sámma-w hallùle-lle.} ‘Fill it with poison and give it to him.’
       (A26:86)
  (15) b-zabnètle ""èlli ""6n-háwe b-ðà-""aqla?} ‘Will you sell it to me if it has one
       leg?’ (A22:5)
  (16) xúwwe mà t-áw6ð b-an-álpa dáwe,} t-áz6n hawènna ""6lle-dìye?!} ‘What will
       the snake do with the thousand gold coins that I should go and
       give them to him?!’ (A1:8)
  (17) xà°i,} Zìne,} hiwála ""êlli.} ‘My sister, Zine gave it to me.’ (A26:38)
  (18) ""ána t-amrênna-llux.} ‘I shall tell it to you.’ (A21:35)When the verb has a definite direct object nominal, this generally takes
an agreement in the form of a direct object pronominal affix and a pro-
nominal indirect object must be expressed by an independent prepositional
phrase, which generally follows, e.g.  (19) bas-yátla Náze ""êlli.} ‘But you must give Naze to me.’ (A25:23)
  (20) qá-mo le-yátla xá°ux ""êlle?} ‘Why won’t you give your sister to him?’
       (A26:72)
  (21) ""ána sámi t-yánne †lalˆxu.} ‘I shall give my portion to you.’ (A21:29)
  (22) t8ra la-pa°xètle ""èlle dìye.} ‘Do not open the door to him.’ (A23:25)
  (23) ""áwwa yála yíw6lle ""álaha ""èlla díya ""6štà yárxe.} ‘God gave them this
       child six months ago.’ (A15:9)In (24) there is a deviation from this usual rule, in that the indirect pro-
nominal object is expressed by an L-suffix on the verb before the L-suffix
that agrees with the direct object nominal:  (24) hállila masr6q°ònti} ‘Give me my little comb’ (A34:3)Occasionally a textually prominent indefinite direct object nominal takes
an agreement pronoun, e.g.  (25) ""áp-""awwa šaqèlla ðá-k6sta qa-d-ày,} yawèlla qa-d-ày.} ‘He also takes a
       purse for her and gives it to her.’ (A4:22)When a direct object nominal has no object agreement on the verb, the
pronominal indirect object is the primary affix on the verb, which is an
L-suffix in verb forms that take L-suffixes. The main circumstances in which
the direct object agreement element is omitted include the following:

       t-yàtli rèsqi.} ‘You are giving to it its sustenance and it is eating it. I
       also shall go down and sleep at home. You will be obliged to give
       me my sustenance.’ (A10:3)(iii) A definite nominal that is a narrow focus
Agreement with a definite direct object is omitted on the verb if the object
constitutes a narrow focus which does not include the verb. The focus may
be a new information focus, in which case the verb is in the presupposition
of the clause, or the focus may be one of prominence, in which case the
verb may be new information but is of reduced prominence, e.g.  (33) har-t-yàtli ða-bráta,} là?} mère hè.} mère yátli S6ttìye.} mère ma-yxàl6f,} t-yán-
       nux S6ttìye.} ‘ “You will still give me a daughter, is that not so?’ ” He
       said “Yes.” He said “You should give me S6ttiye (rather than one of
       the others).” He said “Fine. I’ll give you S6ttiye.” ’ (A25:25)
  (34) ""aláha hóle yíw6lli ""áyya ""ùrxa.} ‘God has given me this way.’ (A21:42)Even when there is no direct object agreement suffix on the verb, the
indirect object can be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase.
This is found at the close of an intonation group to act as end-weight-
ing, e.g.  (35) hátta m5xólta b-kàwe dár6x ""6lle-díye.} ‘We even give food to it through
       the window.’ (A12:62)
790                            chapter fifteenIt is also found where the speaker fronts the phrase to give the indirect
object prominence in order to set it in contrastive opposition to an indirect
object in an adjacent clause, e.g.  (36) ""6n-†lálux yáw6l xà xmára} ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè xmáre.} ‘If he gives to
       you one ass, he will give to your neighbour two asses.’ (A3:4)
  (37) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘I have left nothing for you (whereas I
       have taken everything for myself ).’ (A2:11)At the end of a discourse unit the long alternative type of suffix con-
struction for the expression of an indirect object is occasionally used on
compound verbal forms, whereby the copula element is placed after the
pronominal suffix. For the use of this construction with direct object suf-
fixes for end-weighting see §15.13.5.:  (38) ""6n-mjuwêbla,} xo-""àn6n ""è°ya kêsl6x.} ""6n-là mjuwèbla,} ""àtit °í°a kêsli.}
       qrí°5la qála b-Šál6m ""u-Sùrma,} ‘u-jwába la-yìw6ll5la.} [< yiwa + 6lla
       (3fs. indirect object) + ila (3pl. copula)] ‘ “If they answer you, then
       indeed it is me who has come to you. If they do not answer you,
       you have come to me.” She called Šalem and Surma, but they
       did not give her any reply.’ (A26:4–5)If a past base verb is used in the clause, an indirect pronominal object
tends to be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase in all cir-
cumstances, e.g.  (39) yíwla xa-q7sa xéna ""èlle dìye.} ‘She gave another stick to him.’
       (A22:29)
  (40) ""ím6t ""aláha yíwle ""6lléy bròna} ‘When God gave them a son . . .’
       (A15:17)
  (41) mêre ""èlle díye} ‘He said to him’ (A17:4)
  (42) mère †làli} ‘He said to me’ (A22:8)
  (43) hàtxa mjuwèble ""èlli málka.} ‘The king replied to me thus.’ (A17:34)
  (44) wídla f†árta ""êlli.} ‘She made breakfast for me.’ (A21:35)
                             CHAPTER SIXTEEN                  THE SYNTAX OF PREPOSITIONS
The morphology and basic uses of the prepositions have been described
in §13.3. In this chapter we shall take a closer look at the syntax and
semantic range of the main prepositions, particularly those that have
multiple functions.","[821, 822, 823, 824, 825, 826, 827, 828, 829, 830]"
"16.2.1.8. Combined with other Prepositions
The preposition l- may be combined with other prepositions. After verbs
of movement, for example, it may be combined with k6s-, e.g.  (1) ""o-gáya q9m5°a °élux l-kèsli} ‘the first time you came to me’ (A1:22)16.2.2. Adpronominal Uses16.2.2.1. L-suffixes
The L-suffixes exhibit only a very restricted degree of functional overlap
with the adnominal uses of l-. The most common uses of the L-suffixes
include the expression of the subject of verb forms derived from the past
base (q†ille, q†ilwale) and the expression of the direct and indirect object
of transitive verbs.
    The use of the L-suffixes to express the subject in forms such as q†ille
originated historically as a marking of the agent in a passive construction
(< q†il ‘He was killed’ + le ‘by him’). We have seen above that adnominal
l- is still used to mark the agent of a passive. The L-suffixes have, however,
been extended to the marking of the subject of past base intransitive
verbs, where they clearly do not mark an agent. This can be explained as
a result of the suffixes being reinterpreted as markers of the grammatical
subject of the verb rather than markers of the agent.
806                            chapter sixteen   The direct object function of the L-suffixes has no parallel in the use
of the adnominal l-.
   The use of the L-suffixes to express the indirect object is restricted
for the most part to the marking of a human recipient or beneficiary.
There is no clear parallel to this in the functional range of adnominal l-,
the relation of recipient or beneficiary being normally expressed by the
prepositions ta/†la- or qa- when the complement is a nominal.
   Another use of L-suffixes, which is related to its indirect object func-
tion, is to express the possessor in possessive constructions formed with
the existential particle ""i°, e.g. ""itli k°awa ‘I have a book’. There are no
adnominal parallels to this function. When the possessor is a nominal,
this is normally placed in extraposition and is resumed by an L-suffix, e.g.
xáwri ""ítle k°áwa ‘My friend has a book’ (§17.8.1.2.).
   In general, therefore, the functional correspondence between L-suffixes
and adnominal uses of l- is considerably limited in the present state of
the language.16.2.2.2. ""6ll-
Pronominal prepositional phrases consisting of the particle ""6ll- correspond
to a wide range of the adnominal uses of l-. As with adnominal l-, the
particle ""6ll- represents the merging together of what were originally two
separate prepositions, i.e. *l- and *'al-. The functional range of ""6ll- overlaps
with those of L-suffixes and adnominal l-, but it is not completely parallel
with either of these. It may be classified into the following categories:(i) Destination  (1) ""è°yela mè†ye ""êlle.} ‘They came up to him.’ (A7:19)
  (2) mu°éla yèmme díye xa-rámša ""èlle dìye.} ‘His mother brought dinner to
      him.’ (A21:12)
  (3) zíl5le nùbl6lla} ""èlle dìye.} ‘He went and took them to him.’ (A17:12)
  (4) mam†átla ""èlla dìya.} ‘Deliver them to her.’ (A4:16)
  (5) mšádr6n m5xòlta ""èlle díye.} ‘I shall send food to him.’ (A17:11)This usage is paralleled by adnominal l- with verbs of movement (e.g. ‘to
go’, ‘to come’, ‘to arrive’), but only marginally with verbs of conveyance
(e.g. ‘to send’, ‘to take’, ‘to bring’), which normally express the destination
with ta-/†la or qa- when the complement is a nominal. Verbs of movement
do not usually express destination by L-suffixes, but L-suffixes are used
after verbs of conveyance.

   (8) t-lá-hoya qàr°-6ll6x} ‘so that you are not cold’ (A20:2)Nominal complements of verbs of speech (1)–(2) and recipients or benefi-
ciaries (3)–(4) are normally expressed by phrases containing the prepositions
ta-/†la- or qa- rather than l-. The adnominal equivalents of constructions
such as those in (5)–(8), however, generally have l-.(iii) ‘Upon, over, against’
Location over a physical object is not normally expressed with a pronomi-
nal ""6ll- phrase, although l- as an adnominal preposition is often used with
this sense. The normal means of expressing this relation with pronominal
complements is by phrases consisting of the preposition reš- ‘upon’, e.g. réša
‘on it (f.)’ (A27:17), réše dìye ‘on him’ (A31:10), b-réša ‘over them’ (A25:48),
b-rèša ‘on it’ (A12:47).
    In a few contexts a pronominal ""6ll- phrase is, nevertheless, the historical
reflex of a phrase with the preposition *'al-. These tend to be restricted
to relations of an abstract or non-physical nature, such as (1)–(7), or
constructions such as (8)–(12), which express location on the surface but
not necessarily above the item in question, often in relation to liquids
(11)–(12):   (1) šák6n ""êllux.} ‘I’ll make a complaint about you.’ (A22:46)
   (2) hótu pšàma ""èlla díya.} ‘You are sad over it.’ (A5:10)
   (3) kúlla ""êlli.} ‘It is all on me (= I shall pay for everything).’ (A8:38)
   (4) l5le-""7ba ""6llì?} ‘Would not that be a shame on me?’ (A8:55)
   (5) kúlla q6m-malušíla ""èlla dìya.} ‘They put all of them (her clothes) on
       her.’ (A4:20)
   (6) lá-q5m6t ""6llèy.} ‘You will not rise against them.’ (A8:95)
   (7) zríq5le yóma ""èlle dìye.} ‘The sun shone on him.’ (A26:22)

  (12) qímle murèsle hátxa míya ""6llèy.} ‘He sprinkled water on them like this.’
       (B6:11)We could include here a construction such as (13), which expresses an
external quality:  (13) šúpr6 dúnye hóle ""6lla-dìya.} ‘She had the beauty of the world.’ (A13:11)(iv) Direct Object
Compound verbal forms consisting of a resultative particle or an infinitive
express a pronominal object either by L-suffixes or by a pronominal suffix
attached to the preposition ""6ll-. The use of the ""6ll- phrase is obligatory
when the participle or infinitive does not have a copula enclitic, e.g. hóle
q†íl6lle ‘He has killed him’, but is optional if the construction has a copula
enclitic. Details of the use of ""6ll- with the compound verbal forms are
given in §8.19.4. On rare occasions it is used to mark the pronominal
direct object of a q†ille form (§8.19.2.). It should be noted that this usage of
the prepositional phrase differs from others in that the phrase is generally
bound to the verbal form prosodically and does not stand independently
with its own stress, e.g. mútt6t6lle ‘You put him’ (A22:39), prìm6n6lla ‘I cut it
(f.)’ (A22:9), bì°6llela (bi°a-6lle-ila) ‘She loved him’ (A4:12). This is a prop-
erty it shares with L-suffixes, which likewise cannot be used with prosodic
independence from the verb. Furthermore, the adnominal preposition
l- does not function as a direct object marker.(v) Complement of verbs
Verbs that take l- as their complement before nouns have an ""6ll- phrase
when the noun is pronominalized. This phrase has prosodic indepen-
dence. Given what has been said in the previous section, this prosodic
                        the syntax of prepositions                        809feature should be regarded a reflection of the fact that they are not direct
objects, e.g.  (1)   náše là h>m6níwa ""èlle díye.} ‘People did not believe him.’ (A48:1)
  (2)   ham-mßawòre ""èlle díye.} ‘He curses him again.’ (A17:3)
                               16.3. ˇLA, TA-16.3.1. Direction
The most frequent usage of this preposition is to express the direction,
objective or beneficiary of an action or situation without necessarily any
movement being involved, e.g.  (1)  híw6lla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘They gave the pot to the mullah.’ (A5:8)
  (2)  hálla júllux †làli.} ‘Give your clothes to me.’ (A7:18)
  (3)  maláxa mère †la-ràbb6n.} ‘The angel said to the monk.’ (A15:7)
  (4)  ""u-°élux mdagóle †làli.} ‘and you came lying to me.’ (A1:23)
  (5)  wídla ""ixàla} †la-yàla.} ‘She made food for the young man.’
       (A21:22)
  (6) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘and for you I have left nothing.’
       (A2:11)
  (7) b8y6n msóq6n xákma m6ndiyàne} †la-bˆ°a.} ‘I want to buy a few things
       for the house.’ (A22:12)
  (8) ""ítl6n xá-m6ndi b8y6x t-oðèxxe †làl6x.} ‘There is something that we want
       to do for you.’ (A4:48)
  (9) ""áyya šwí°a †láli ""u-†làlux-ila.} ‘This bed is for me and you.’ (A22:32)
  (10) lá p5š6x †la-x>dàya.} ‘We shall not stay for lunch.’ (A21:30)
  (11) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘The cooking pot became the mullah’s.’
       (A5:10)
  (12) †la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why (literally: for what) have you done
       this to me?’ (A15:14)16.3.2. Destination
It is occasionally used after verbs or movement or conveyance expressing
destination, e.g.
810                           chapter sixteen  (1) dè‰‰a ta-""a°rˆy.} ‘They returned to their land.’ (A4:27)
  (2) ""6n-b8y6t ""áz6t d7‰6t †la-b7°6t bàb6x} ‘If you want to go and return to
      the house of your father’ (A4:42)
  (3) ""u-náb6lla †la-be-šwàw6n.} ‘Take it to our neighbours’ house.’ (A5:3)16.3.3. Temporal Objective
The preposition may be used to express a temporal objective in construc-
tions such as (1)–(3):  (1) ""áni zílla ta-†¬à-yomane.} ‘They went for three days.’ (A14:84)
  (2) ""awwa ""askaríya dìye} †là-k6ma dán5la?} ‘For how long is this army of
      his?’ (A17:22)
  (3) píšla yóma †la-yòma,} yóma †la-yòma.} ‘She went on (like this) from day
      to day, day to day.’ (A21:1)16.3.4. Object Marker
It is occasionally used to mark the direct object (§15.13.6.). This is attested
only before definite nominals, the majority of which have animate ref-
erents, e.g.  (1) ""áwwa q†ìlle †la-""árya.} ‘He killed the lion.’ (A11:1)
  (2) díya ""áwwa b8ye ta-d-áyya bráta zùrta.} ‘Now, he loves this young girl.’
      (A14:83)
  (3) taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo.} ‘I remember the wedding of my brother
      Š6mmo.’ (B8:21)
  (4) zìpt6llela} †la-M9mo.} ‘She pushed M>mo.’ (A26:3)
  (5) xá-xuwwe plí†a táma b8ye nayèsle †la-brØn d-ó fall?˙.} ‘A snake had come
      out of there wanting to bite the son of that peasant.’ (A9:6)
                                  16.4. QA-The preposition qa- has distribution that is broadly parallel with that of
ta-/†la-.","[844, 845, 846, 847, 848, 849]"
"  (26) A: xzéli bàbux} B: là,} màmi xzélux.} ‘A: “I saw your father.” B: “No,
       you saw my uncle.” ’
  (27) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:
       “Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten
       a peach. He has not eaten an apple.” ’In such cases the remainder of the clause belongs to the presuppositional
background, i.e. it is assumed to be known to the hearer. What is unknown
is the identity of the argument in question. In (25) the presuppositional
background of the clause with the fronted object is ‘You saw x’ and in (26)
it is ‘My brother has eaten x’. What the speaker is asserting, i.e. the new
information that he is conveying, is the identity of x in each case. Note
that in clauses with compound verbal forms, the copula is attached to the
fronted object. Examples from the text corpus (see §15.4.1.4.1 i):  (28) l7w6n °í°a b-xabr6 dìye.} ""áyya xá°e dìyela.} b-xábr6t xá°6 dìy6n °í°a.} ‘I
       did not come at his word. She is his sister. I came at the word of
       his sister.’ (A8:85)
  (29) ""àn6n mú°y6lle.} ‘I (and not my brother) have brought it back.’
       (A24:31)
878                         chapter seventeenThe fronted object in focus may be introduced by an inclusive or restric-
tive particle (‘also, only’), e.g.  (30) ""ap-mêlxa piðále.} ‘He passed by also the salt.’ (A24:19)
  (31) mèri qa-yêmmi} bas-mìya mátt6t qam-réša díya.} ‘I said to my mother
       “Place only water by her head.” ’ (A21:37)The inclusive particle ""ap is also used with initial object constructions that
have the nuclear stress on the verb and so do not express narrow focus on
the object but rather a broader focus on the proposition as a whole, e.g.  (32) hot-ß†ìm6lle b7°6t xálux.} ""ap-b7°i b8y6t ßa†mêtle?} ‘You have ruined
       the house of your uncle. Do you want to ruin also my house?’
       (A23:39)
  (33) ""úp Mar-Sáwa q6m-talêxle.} ‘He also destroyed (the church of) Saint
       Sawa.’ (B6:33)
  (34) béna ""àw} ma-t-íwa hal-hàd6x,} b>yéwa qa-""alàha} ""u-""aláha b>yèwale,}
       ""ap-míya muklèle gu-d-5-sálla.} ‘He was so (holy), he loved God and
       God loved him, that he could even hold water in the basket.’
       (A16:10)17.7.6. Double Objects
In constructions that take two direct object nominal constituents these are
normally both placed after the verb, e.g.  (1)   ""áxni šaqlèxxe ""u-áá¬6xxa ‘ántux zùze.} ‘We shall take it and fill your
        bag with money.’ (A39:14)
  (2)   madoqíla xètna-w k yálo got6-©ðàðe} ‘They make the groom and bride
        hold each other’s side.’ (B5:50)The first object constituent may be fronted before the verb in contexts
where single object constituents are fronted. In (3), for example, the
fronting of the object ‘his bag’ occurs in a clause that is intended to be
cohesive with what precedes in a close temporal sequence. In (4) the object
is fronted in a topic-orientated construction that is presented as parallel
with what precedes:  (3)   wídla ""ixàla} †la-yàla.} xìlle.} ‘ánte díye dwíqla zwàðe.} ‘She made
        food for the youth. He ate. She packed his bag with provisions.’
        (A21:22)
                                     the clause                                      879  (4) t-óð6n ""ixàla,} xá""a m6n-d-ánna kúbbe gò‰e.} xá""a †la-xmà°ila} ""u-xá †la-gàw‰i.}
      ""a-t-ìla †láli} ""awðánna trè-q6sme,} t-yánna xa-†làlux} ""u-xá †la-
      w9zìr.} ‘I’ll make food, one of these big meat-balls. One is for my
      mother-in-law, one is for my husband. The one that is for me I’ll
      make into two parts and give one to you and one to the vizier.’
      (A21:28)17.7.7. Subject—Object—Verb
Occasionally the object is fronted before the verb when the clause has an
initial subject constituent. Most attested cases of such constructions have
independent pronouns as subject, e.g.  (1) mère yába b-zabnètle ""èlli ""6n-háwe b-ðà-""aqla?} mère zílla °èla} ða-""àqla!} ""áti
      ""áqla šqùlla} ‘He said “Will you sell it to me if it has one leg?”
      He said “All this fuss (literally: they have gone, they have come),
      now one leg! Take the leg.” ’ (A22:5)
  (2) t-óð6n ""ixàla,} xá""a m6n-d-ánna kúbbe gò‰e.} xá""a †la-xmà°ila} ""u-xá †la-gàw‰i.}
      ""a-t-ìla †láli} ""awðánna trè-q6sme,} t-yánna xa-†làlux} ""u-xá †la-w9zìr.} . . . ""ána
      sámi t-yánne †lalˆxu} ""ána lè-y-axl6n.} ‘I’ll make food, one of these
      big meat-balls. One is for my mother-in-law, one is for my husband.
      The one that is for me I’ll divide into two parts and give one to
      you and one to the vizier. . . . I shall give my share to you. I shall
      not eat.’ (A21:28–29)
  (3) sóg6n m7°o xárj-u bárj6t botanàye} ""u-""ána xá°i t-yánna †la-M9mo.}
      ‘Go and collect the taxes of the people of Botan and I shall give
      my sister to M>mo.’ (A26:73)In all cases the object is anaphorically bound to the preceding context
and the clause is semantically cohesive with what precedes. As we have
seen, clause initial subject pronouns are in principle used to signal some
kind of disjoining from what precedes, so there appears to be some ten-
sion here. The main motivation to use the subject pronouns seems to be
to give prominence to the clause as a whole.","[916, 917, 918]"

the speaker is swearing, e.g.  (1) mèra b-rèšux.} ""áti mútt6t-6lle tàma.} ‘She said “(I swear) by your head.
      You put him there.” ’ (A22:39)The preposition is most frequently used with this function before the
noun ""alaha ‘God’ in the phrase b-álaha, which is usually stressed on the
first syllable and often pronounced [b-a[la]. This expression is used in a
variety of contexts. In general it strengthens an assertion, by committing
the speaker fully to the truth of the statement, e.g.  (2) b-álaha ""áwwa xoš-yàl5le.} ‘By God, he is a good lad.’ (A21:5)
  (3) b-álaha d°s-it.} ‘By God, you are right.’ (A17:19)It is often used to introduce the response to a question, e.g.  (4) ""o-tèla} mère há lˆk6t zála,} ya-gáni dêbba?} b-álaha xðár6n bá°6r rêsqi.} ‘The
      fox said “Hey, where are you going, my dear bear?” “By God, I’m

      is her story?” He said “By God, her story is like this.” ’ (A4:14)It is used to strengthen a remonstration expressed by a negative question,
e.g.  (7) b-álaha látwa mìrta} la-h7w6n ""u-lá b6‰-náša ""áw6r gu-""òt6x?} ‘By God, did
      you not say that no animal and no person should enter the room?’
      (A23:22)
798                            chapter sixteen16.1.10. Complements of Verbs and Expressions
The preposition b- is used as the complement of some verbs, e.g. dbaša
b- ‘to stick to’, dqara b- ‘to touch’, mbaxole b- ‘to envy’, mhaymone b- ‘to
believe in’, mparoje b- ‘to look at’, tfaqa b- ‘to meet’, †paya b- ‘to catch
onto (fire)’, parpore b- ‘to plead to’, qya°a b- ‘to hit’, tpara b- ‘to threaten’,
xðaya b- ‘to rejoice in’, xkaka/gxaka b- ‘to laugh at’, xqara b- ‘to honour’,
xyara b- ‘to look at’. It is also used as the obligatory complement of some
attributive expressions, e.g. bista b- ‘familiar with’, bliga b- ‘busy with’, x6ðya
b- ‘pleased with’.
   Several verbs may take a direct object complement or a complement
introduced by the preposition b-. In general the construction with the
prepositional complement is used to express a situation in which the action
affects the referent to a lesser extent than when a direct complement is
used, or a situation in which the action is less directly associated with the
referent. Some pairs are given below by way of illustration:
   ðaya + object ‘to know, understand (sth., so. by direct knowledge)’, ðaya
b-‘to know about (sth. so. indirectly)’, e.g.  (1) y6ðènne ""á°‰6t bàbi.} ‘I know the land of my father.’ (A14:90)
  (2) hé b-àlaha,} qídle b7°6t duglàna-w} ""áxni là-ðiye bíye.} ‘Oh, by God, the
      house of the liar has burnt down, without us knowing about it.’
      (A48:7)mxaya + object ‘to strike’, mxaya b- ‘to play (a musical instrument)’, e.g.  (3) lá maxênn6x.} ‘I shall not strike you.’ (A51:19)
  (4) ""Ašeba†àlo} ""áwwa máxe b-zòrna.} ‘Ašeba†alo played the pipe’ (A25:26)mšaxlope + object ‘to change’, mšaxlope b- ‘to exchange’, e.g.  (5) ta-mšaxèlpi šèmm6t ’ùxo} ‘in order for them to change the name ’uxo’
      (A7:3)
  (6) mšuxlèpla b-is6qyà°a.} ‘They exchanged rings.’ (A4:5)zmara + object ‘to sing (a song)’, zmara b- ‘to sing to (so.)’, e.g.  (7) ""i-zamríwa ràwe.} ‘They used to sing rawe.’ (B15:75)
  (8) zmírre b-Zìne.} ‘He sang to Zine.’ (A25:22)

  (10) ""u-rípel6lle kùlla,} nyása-w xàla ""èbbe-diye.} ‘They (the animals) all
       attacked him, biting and eating bits of him (= gnawing him).’
       (A35:21)Some verbs can take a direct object or another preposition but use b- before
a referent that is disadvantaged in some way by the action, e.g.  (11) †la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why have you done this to me?’
       (A15:14)
  (12) xzi-málka bt-áw6ð bìyi.} ‘See, the king will do (something) to me.’
       (A21:33)
  (13) ""áp-""ana šqiláli š6ndùxta} d6ryáli bìya.} ‘I picked up a small stone and
       threw it at it.’ (A23:22)
  (14) ""áp-xa l5le-mßáya bíya dìya.} ‘Nobody could (do anything) against her
       (= nobody could defeat her).’ (A25:68)
  (15) šuréla ßráxa bíye dìye.} ‘She started shouting at him.’ (A25:82)
  (16) bálki t-íle xa-mèndi °í°a bìya.} ‘Perhaps something has happened to
       her.’ (A21:25)The preposition with the sense of ‘disadvantage’ is found after the exis-
tential particle in expressions such as:  (17) ""ána bsìmli} ‘ú-mdi li°-bìyi.} ‘I am cured. Nothing is the matter with
       me.’ (A4:20)With some verbs the preposition b- may be exchanged for other preposi-
tions to express a different relationship to the complement. In (18), for
example, the verb xyara ‘to look’ takes a complement with b- (‘look at’),
but in the second clause the complement has gu- to express ‘looking into’
the enclosed interior of the cave:  (18) qamáye xírta b-áql6t súsa dìya,} la-xírra gu-gêppa.} ‘At first she looked at
       the legs of her horse, she did not look into the cave.’ (A8:72)
800                             chapter sixteen16.1.11. b6d-, bud-
The expression b6d- and its variant bud- is in origin a combination of the
preposition b- and the subordinating particle D. It is not, however, used
with exactly the same distribution as the basic preposition b-. It gener-
ally has the sense of ‘about, concerning’, which is not a meaning that is
generally expressed by b- alone, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-xá-naša m7°elaxu xàbra} b6d-bròni,} kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a
        ""6n-ßàxi,} pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle dìye.} ‘If somebody brings you word
        about my son—whoever brings me word about my son, whether
        he is dead or alive, I’ll give him half of my gold.’ (A14:92)
  (2)   ""ánna šèmye-wawa b6d-M8mo m6n-Zìne.} ‘They had heard about M>mo
        from Zine.’ (A26:25)
  (3)   šmìla bud-díye.} ‘They heard about him.’ (A21:5)
  (4)   lá taxmènn6n ""ána b6d-z6ndàna.} ‘I shall not think about prison (= I
        don’t care about prison).’ (A26:44)
  (5)   náše spáy t-y8ði bud-màrra} ‘fine people who know about the illness’
        (A8:32)
  (6)   qím6n molèxm6nna ""ánna šére bud-dìye.} ‘I composed these verses about
        him.’ (C4:3)
  (7)   b6d-""áwwa náša tàlx6x.} ‘Let’s destroy with regard to this man (= let’s
        get rid of this man).’ (A30:41)Elsewhere the phrase is occasionally used to denote relations that are
expressed by the basic b- preposition, including causal (‘because of, on
account of ’), instrumental (‘through the means of ’) and comitative (‘with’),
e.g.  (8)  bud-àyya mu°7lux ""ánna zúze.} ‘Because of this you have brought these
       coins.’ (A1:27)
  (9) rába ""ítley xayú°a basímta b6d-àyya,} yá'ni zrát6t xabùše.} ‘They had a
       very good life on account of this, that is the cultivation of apples.’
       (B5:106)
  (10) y-axlíwa lèxma bêd-an q7se.} ‘They would eat bread through the means
       of (the sale of ) this wood.’ (A14:10)
  (11) ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘This head of mine
       will one day be cut off by your hands.’ (A14:35)
  (12) qímla k°úla xa-k°àwa,} mšudèrra b6d-qàz6d.} ‘She wrote a letter and
       sent it by a messenger.’ (A11:17)

       water.’ (B5:100)In addition it is found in a few fixed expressions, e.g.  (14) qím5le híw6lla bná°e dìye} †la-d-an-nàše,} b6d-xá†6r d-ó-xona zòra.} ‘He gave
       his daughters to those people on account of that young brother.’
       (A12:22)
  (15) har-dmíxt5la b6d-lèbba gu-b7°6t bába dìy5la.} ‘She continued sleeping,
       thinking that she was in her father’s house.’ (A21:18)16.1.12. Combined with Other Prepositions
The preposition b- is often combined with the locative preposition reš-
‘upon’, e.g.  (1)   hóle dèrya jùlla b-réša.} ‘He put a cloth over them.’ (A25:48)
  (2)   qím5le zíla mútta ""án-julla díya gu-d-o-sandùqa,} mútt6lla gu-""asàs6t b7°a,}
        ""u-bèny5le gùda b-réše.} ‘He put her clothes in a box and placed it in
        the foundations of the house, then built a wall over it.’ (A14:99)
                                     16.2. L-This preposition has a wide variety of functions. One reason for this is
that it is derived from two different prepositions in earlier Aramaic, namely
*l-‘to, for’ and *'al ‘upon’. Generally the usage of l- in the dialect makes it
clear from which of these two earlier prepositions it is derived in any one
particular case. In some cases, however, the derivation is not completely
certain. For this reason all the usages of l- are here treated together. It is
important, furthermore, to make a distinction between the adnominal uses
of l- and the adpronominal forms. Various possibilities exist for pronomi-
nalizing a phrase consisting of l + nominal. These include the L-suffixes
and independent phrases consisting of ""6ll- + pronominal suffixes. Each
of these pronominal forms has a restricted usage and is not found in all
contexts that l + nominal phrases are used.
802                           chapter sixteen16.2.1. Adnominal Uses16.2.1.1. Destination
The preposition l- is frequently used in the complement of a verb of
movement to express the destination, e.g.  (1)   ""áwwa qíma zíla l-bˆ°e díye.} ‘He went to his house.’ (A17:6)
  (2)   ""è°y5le l-bˆ°a.} ‘He came home.’ (A17:20)
  (3)   si-dú‰ l-šòpux.} ‘Go back to your place.’ (A15:20)
  (4)   ha-t-""á°e ""o-náša qamàya} má†e l-""ˆna} ""á°e xa-náša sàwa.} ‘Before the
        first man reached the spring, an old man came.’ (A15:3)
  (5)   dèqne díye m†áya l-9ra.} ‘His beard reached the ground.’ (A15:13)
  (6)   t-ásq6x l-áwwa †ùra?} ‘Shall we go up to this mountain?’ (A17:4)
  (7)   masqánne l-bˆ°a.} ‘I shall take it up to the house.’ (A22:19)
  (8)   °éla ßlèla} l-""árx6t be-Xàmmo.} ‘She came down to the water-mill of
        the family of Xammo.’ (A19:1)
  (9)   ’úxo híwle bále l-bˆ°a.} ‘’uxo set off for home.’ (A7:12)In some cases the movement has a purposive sense, e.g.  (10) lá-""az6t l-q7se b-xáwl6t xàwrux.} ‘Do not go to (collect) wood with the
       rope of your friend.’ (D2:71)16.2.1.2. Direction
It may be used to express, broadly, the direction or objective of an action
without any clear movement towards the complement of the preposition
being invovled. It should be noted, however, that the relation of recipient
or beneficiary is normally expressed by the prepositions ta/†la- or qa- when
the complement is a nominal:  (1)   ràbb6n} ""áwwa t-i-sàx6ð l-""álaha.} ‘A monk is somebody who worships
        God.’ (A15:4)
  (2)   dráya búxt6n l-xá l-d-o-xèna} ‘slandering this one and that one’
        (A48:5)
  (3)   dréla šláma l-f9qih.} ‘She greeted the jurist.’ (A22:16)
  (4)   ""álaha šuxa-l-šèmme ‘God—praise be to his name’ (A6:10)
  (5)   ""ána †líbt6nwa l-brón6t màmi.} ‘I was engaged to my cousin.’ (A13:14)

In numerous cases l- has the sense of ‘upon’ or ‘on’, denoting a spatial
location above or, at least, on the surface of the referent that it governs.
The preposition in such cases is clearly derived from *'al:  (1)   hóle tíwa l-kèpa.} ‘He is sitting on a stone.’ (A15:13)
  (2)   bròn-málka tíw5le l-d-a-tàxta.} ‘The son of the king sat on the throne.’
        (A14:43)
  (3)   †ayènwale l-xàße.} ‘He would carry him on his back.’ (A17:18)
  (4)   párxa ""átwa l-gàre.} ‘She flew up and sat on the roof.’ (A14:101)
  (5)   klí°a l-márz6 d-a-j>zìra.} ‘It came to rest on the shore of the island.’
        (A14:39)
  (6)   máxewa darmàna} l-ßàwle.} ‘He used to put polish on shoes.’ (A16:1)
  (7)   míla l-hàlux!} ‘Blue on your condition! (= Confound you!)’ (A23:10)In certain contexts, where the verb involves movement, the preposition
has a sense of ‘onto’,  (8)  sìq5le} l-gàre.} ‘He went up onto the roof.’ (A25:52)
  (9)  ta-d7rela l-xáß6t xmàre} ‘in order that he puts them onto the back of
       his donkey’ (A23:13)
  (10) mattíwala l-""9ra.} ‘They would put it onto the ground.’ (A12:3)In constructions with the verb mxy used with the sense of ‘applying’ a
substance to something, the adnominal preposition l- may be used with
the item upon which the substance is applied (11) or a transposition may
take place as in (12), in which the preposition is placed on the nominal
expressing the substance:  (11) máxewa darmàna} l-ßàwle.} ‘He used to put polish on shoes.’
       (A16:1)
  (12) ""u-mèxy6x6lla má°6n kúlla l-míla-w l-kóma m-bá°re dìye.} ‘and we have
       covered all our village with blue and black after him (= after his
       departure).’ (A4:32)In some cases where the preposition l- corresponds to *'al in earlier Ara-
maic it has the sense of ‘concerning, about’, e.g.  (13) mbaqóre l-d-ò-naša:} ""ìtle bróna?} ‘He was inquiring concerning the
       man: Has he a son?’ (A8:5)
804                             chapter sixteen16.2.1.4. General Spatial Location
In some cases it denotes a static spatial location without any implication
of being ‘above’ in a higher position, e.g.  (1)   hóle ""àrya} l-àyya góta} ""u-""êzza} hóla l-àyya góta.} ‘There is a lion on this
        side and a she-goat on the other side.’ (A24:15)
  (2)   ""u-xmáre l-gòte-diye} ‘with his ass at his side’ (A7:6)
  (3)   l-a-pá°a xét6t nèra} ""í° xa-má°6t huðàye.} ‘On the other side of the river
        there is a village of Jews.’ (A14:50)
  (4)   ""u-xètna l-b7°a pˆšena.} ‘and I shall become a son-in-law in the house.’
        (A17:35)

  (8)   ""u-qáre l-t9ra.} ‘and he calls at the door.’ (A6:5)
  (9)   ""u-šawqíwale l-šêmša.} ‘and they would leave it in the sun.’ (B7:20)We could include here the adverbial laxxa ‘here’, which has been formed
from l- + ""axxa and may be used to denote static location. The l- that
is often used with the particle of isolation xoð- (§14.6.) also falls in this
category, e.g.  (10) pìšela} har-""àni-tre l-xoðéy.} ‘Only those two remained by themselves.’
       (A20:9)16.2.1.5. Expression of the Agent
An adnominal l- is sporadically used to express the agent in constructions
with resultative participles (cf. §15.9.2.–3.), e.g.  (1)   šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwa.} ‘The seven of them have been eaten by
        wolves.’ (A23:15)
  (2) ""6n-réš6t bábe díye ""ax-†ùra,} ""u-hóle q†íla l-T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi,} lˆka
        bt-áz6l?} ‘If the head of his father is like a mountain and he has been
        killed by T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi, where will he go?’ (A28:8)
  (3) xá°ux Nasímo jlíwt5la l-""arabàye.} ‘Your sister Nasimo has been kid-
        napped by Arabs.’ (A37:5)
  (4) ""u-Dùre} píšt5la muqyàmta} muxràwta} šawwà gáye} l-xànpe} qa†òle}
      t-muš6lmàne.} ‘Dure was evacuated and destroyed seven times by
      pagan murderers of Muslims.’ (B2:2)

      saddle, which was made by the town craftsmen.’ (A8:52)16.2.1.6. Manner
The use of the preposition l- in adverbials of manner is restricted to
numerical expressions such as (1):  (1) píšela mnáy6lla l-xà-xa.} ‘They began counting them one by one.’
      (A6:3)16.2.1.7. Complement of Verbs and Expressions
The preposition l- occurs as a complement to various verbs and expres-
sions, e.g. dmaya l- ‘to resemble’, masloye l- ‘to despise’, maßyo°e l- ‘to listen
to’, mhaymone l- ‘to believe in’, mqahore l- ‘to grieve for’, qrawa l-, mqarobe
l- ‘to approach’, mraxome l- ‘to pity’, mßawore l- ‘to curse’, mxaya l- ‘to hit,
knock’, n†ara l- ‘to watch’, †>ya l- ‘to search for’.","[834, 835, 836, 837, 838, 839, 840, 841, 842, 843, 844]"
"  (1)   S6ttíye ""5-gò‰ta-wawa} ""u-Nàze} gawˆ°a} ""u-Zíne ""5-zòrt6t kúlla.} ‘S6ttiye
        was the oldest one, Naze the middle one and Zine the youngest.’
        (A26:20)
  (2)   bejíye hóla xa-gòta} ""èrwa xa-gòta.} ‘The young lambs were one side
        and the sheep the other.’ (A25:31)Such gapping of the verb ‘to be’ is more commonly found in clauses
containing compound verbal forms that consist of the verb ‘to be’ and the
resultative participle or the infinitive. This occurs in narrative in clauses
expressing an event that is presented as directly sequential to a preceding
event (§15.4.1.3.):  (3)   ""è°y5le wìra.} ‘He came and entered.’ (A26:47)
  (4)   ""u-sìq5le} súse kèlya tàma.} ‘He went up and his horse stopped there.’
        (A26:28)
                                   the clause                                 853  (5) ""ánna plà†5la,} kúlla zála ßˆda.} ‘They go out and all go hunting.’

      ‘He handed over his horse to the servant. He entered his tent and
      slept until morning.’ (A12:8)17.6.3. Presentative Constructions with the Particle ""ina
The presentative particle ""ina is used in various contexts to introduce a
referent or a proposition in place of the verb ‘to be’ (§18.1.5.1.), e.g.  (1) qrúla qrúla kèsle dìye} ""ína xa-bˆ°a,} xa-qáßra rába šapìra.} ‘They came
      near to it and behold a house, a very beautiful palace.’ (A14:42)
  (2) ""ína xa-senìye} dáwa xaße-díye xá-xuwwe zòra,} réš6t nàša} ""u-gán6t xùwwe,}
      gu-d-à seníye.} ‘Behold a gold tray on which there was a small snake
      with the head of a man and the body of a snake.’ (A14:31)
  (3) qímela zíle xèzye ""ína d°s} xa-képa hàtxa} ""u-ða-yàdde gáwe díye,} t-prêzla.}
      ‘They went and saw that it was true, there was a stone like this,
      with a handle of iron in it.’ (A14:13)
  (4) yèmme dìye} ""u-báxte díye táma xèzy6lle sùsa,} ""ína sapìqa.} ‘His mother and
      his wife there saw that the horse was without a rider (literally: saw
      the horse behold empty).’ (A28:29)17.6.4. Presentative Constructions with Demonstratives
In clauses with the speaker deixis demonstrative as subject which have
the function of presenting an item to the hearer, the copula is usually
omitted, e.g.  (1) ""áwwa qðìla.} ‘This is the key (= Here is the key).’ (A12:63)
  (2) ""áwwa ""ixàla} †làlux.} ‘This is food for you (= Here is some food for
      you).’ (A17:12)Of a similar nature is the phrase ""áyya xá-šeta (literally: This is a year =
Look it is a year) in (3):  (3) ""áyya xá-šeta hóla támma láxxa l7la mbaqorêllux.} ‘It has been a year that
      they have been here but have not asked for you.’ (A26:78)
854                           chapter seventeen17.6.5. Exclamatory Clauses
When the clause expresses an exclamation, the verb ‘to be’ is often omit-
ted, e.g.  (1) ""áti bìš-zlima mènni!} ‘You are more oppressed than me!’ (A13:5)
  (2) ""áwwa hambišàya!} ‘It is a giant!’ (A31:2)
  (3) nèmu ""ánna là-biš †áwe m-áwwa Gozáli xóni!} ‘Surely they are not better
      than Gozali, my brother!’ (A8:72)In various constructions expressing wishes, a deontic form of the verb
hwy is omitted, e.g.  (4) basíma ràba.} ‘Thank you very much.’ (literally: ‘May you be very
      healthy’; cf. háw6t basíma ràba} A22:31)
  (5) qè†ma b-rèšux!} ‘May ash be on your head!’ (A23:8)
  (6) ""álaha šuxa-l-šèmme ‘God—praise be to his name’ (A6:10)
  (7) bríxta dudíya t-iw6t ""áti qíma gàwa!} ‘Blessed be the cradle in which you
      grew up!’ (A21:41)
  (8) y-azíwa mšamšíwa b5°-qòra,} rè˙qa m6n-an-dukàne!} ‘They would go and
      hold a ceremony in the cemetery—(may death be) far from these
      places!’ (B10:3)The exclamation may be expressed in the form of a question, e.g.  (9) mú-t qála dìyi?} ‘What is my voice (in comparison with his)?’
      (A25:44)17.6.6. Proverbs
Expressions of the verb ‘to be’ are often omitted in proverbial contexts, e.g.  (1) lèxma šaxína darmán6t náša kpìna.} ‘Hot bread is the medicine of a
      hungry man.’ (D2:69)
  (2) lišáne rìxa} ""u-xáße †wìxa.} ‘His tongue is long, but his back is broken.’
      (D2:67)
  (3) dárta l-yòma,} ""èrwe gu-gòma.} dárta l-sèra,} ""èrwe l-†èra.} ‘If the sun has a
      halo, the sheep will be in the basement stable. If the moon has a
      halo, the sheep will be in the noon sun.’ (D2:15)

In some meteorological expressions that have the general term dunye ‘world,
weather’ as subject or leave the subject unspecified, the copula tends to be
omitted, e.g. ""èdyo šaxìnta} ‘Today it is hot’. In a similar manner the copula
is omitted in meteorological expressions with an infinitive such as dúnye
ràya} ‘It is raining’ or ráya tàlga} ‘It is snowing.’
                           17.7. Verbal Clauses17.7.1. Basic Verbal Clauses
A verbal clause may consist of a verbal form alone, with the participants
of the activity expressed by affixes but without any other independently
standing components, e.g.  (1) ""àz6l} ‘He goes.’ (A28:33)
  (2) ""à°ena.} ‘I shall come back.’ (A26:30)
  (3) damxàwa.} ‘She would go to sleep.’ (A18:1)
  (4) raqðìwa.} ‘They would dance.’ (B7:4)
  (5) tìwle.} ‘He sat down.’ (A15:1)
  (6) kpìnna.} ‘They became hungry.’ (A20:9)
  (7) t-axlênne.} ‘I shall eat it.’ (A23:5)17.7.2. Clauses with a Subject Constituent
When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is placed either before
or after the verb.","[891, 892, 893, 894]"
"  (3) A: ""7k5le gêrðo?} B: hón xíl6lle gêrðo.} ‘A: “Where is the stew?” B: “I
      have eaten the stew.” ’
662                           chapter fifteen  (4)   A: ""7k5le gêrðo?} B: xílli gêrðo.} ‘A: “Where is the stew?” B: “I have
        eaten the stew.” ’The difference between these is as follows. The resultative construction in
(3) asserts a present state that is disconnected temporally from the event that
caused it, so the event must have happened at some time in the past that
is not adjacent to the present moment, e.g. several hours ago or yesterday.
The q†ille form would be used as in (4) when the endpoint of the past event
is adjacent to the present, i.e. I have just now eaten it, where a translation
with the English perfect of recent past would be appropriate.
   The indeterminateness of the event signified by the resultative form
means that the individual referents of plural nouns or nouns of mass in
the clause can be interpreted as being distributed over more than one
event during a particular duration of time, e.g.  (5)   ""èdyo hón xíla rába xabùše.} ‘Today I have eaten many apples.’
  (6)   ""èdyo hóla ""è°ye rába nàše.} ‘Today many people have come.’
  (7)   ""èdyo hón xíla lêxma.} ‘Today I have eaten bread.’Example (5), with a plural patient argument ‘apples’, can be interpreted as
meaning that during the course of today up to the present moment there
have been various occasions on which I have eaten apples. The consump-
tion of ‘many apples’ may have been distributed over various events, with
a few apples being eaten on each occasion. It could also be interpreted
as denoting the result of a single event of apple eating. Likewise example
(6), which has a plural subject argument, can be interpreted as meaning
either that the ‘many people’ came separately in a series of discrete events
or that they arrived together. The construction reports only that ‘many
people’ are in the resultant state of ‘having come’, without denoting that
this was the result of one or of a series of events. The interpretation of
(7), which has a noun of mass ‘bread’ as an object argument, could be
that I have eaten some bread on various occasions today or on only one
occasion. Contrast this with the equivalent clauses with q†ille forms:  (8) ""èdyo xílli rába xabùše.} ‘Today I ate many apples.’
  (9) ""èdyo °éla rába nàše.} ‘Today many people came.’
  (10) ""èdyo xílli lêxma.} ‘Today I ate bread.’The q†ille form denotes a specific event and (8)–(10) must be interpreted
as referring to single events. The adverbial ""6dyo ‘today’ would normally
                              the syntax of verbs                                 663force the interpretation that the endpoint of these events occurred before
the present moment and so they must be translated with the English
preterite.
   In some circumstances the context indicates the specific event that
caused the present result. If, for example, the clause contains a punctual
time adverbial binding the event to a particular point in time with no
duration, the event is fully specified. Clauses containing the resultative
form combined with such time adverbials, therefore, assert the existence
of a present state and the context signals that it has been caused by this
specific event. These would still differ from corresponding clauses with the
q†ille form, which assert the occurrence of the event but the existence of a
present state is only a possible implicature, which may be cancelled. Note
that in English the present perfect is not used when the clause contains
such time adverbials, e.g.  (11) xóni hóle ""è°ya ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""èóóa-w pàlge.} ‘My brother came today at
       half past nine.’
  (12) xóni °éle ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""èóóa-w pàlge.} ‘My brother came today at half
       past nine.’The construction (11) with the resultative form asserts that my brother is
currently in the state of ‘having come’ and so would be the natural con-
struction to use if he is still here. Construction (12) could be interpreted
as implying that he is still here, but this implicature could be cancelled
and the form would still be felicitous (13). Any corresponding denial of
the existence of the present result with the resultative construction would
not be felicitous (14), e.g.  (13) xóni °éle ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""êóóa,} bás plí†le bá°6r pàlg6t-sa""6t.} ‘My brother
       came today at nine o’clock, but left after half an hour.’
  (14) ?? xóni hóle ""è°ya ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""êóóa,} bás hóle plí†a bá°6r pàlg6t-sa""6t.} ‘My
       brother came today at nine o’clock, but left after half an hour.’The functional features of the resultative that have been described above
are also discernible in its negated form l5le q†ila. The negative form l5le
""6°ya ‘He has not come’ can be analysed as meaning that he is currently
not in a state of ‘having come’. Thus no specific event is negated. The
implication is that no event of coming has occurred at any time. The
negative la q†ille form, on the other hand, negates the occurrence of a spe-
cific event in the recent past. The event has its specificity and definiteness
664                            chapter fifteenby being bound to a particular point in time in the discourse context.
Consider (15):  (15) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmo
       la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
       you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)Here the question with the negated q†ille form la-qìmlux is intended to
ask why the addressee did not get up specifically at the time that the
speaker greeted him. The translation of such negated q†ille forms by the
English perfect of recent past is appropriate in a context where an event
was expected to occur and the endpoint of its occurrence was expected
to be adjacent with the present. If somebody is expected to arrive at a
house at a particular time, somebody in the house may say °èle? ‘Has he
come?’ The response to this could be là °éle ‘He has not come’, which
would deny that he has come at this expected specific point in time in
the recent past, with no necessary implication that he will come in the
future. After uttering this, it would be appropriate to assert an action that
is sequential to this specific point in time, e.g. là °éle.} ""àz6x.} ‘He has not
come. Let’s go’. The negated q†ille form là-°ela in (16) from the text corpus
should be interpreted in this way:  (16) xéna ""ána q7m6n ""áz6n ""ùmra,} ""ánna xon>wá°a là-°ela.} ‘Well, I shall
       go to church. These brothers have not come back (now when I
       expected them to come).’ (A37:2)Note also (17), in which the absence of expectation that the man will
come in the future is made explicit:  (17) xóni zílle ""u-lá °èle.} ""u-díya ""ána hon-xšáwa leš-""à°e.} ‘My brother has
       gone and has not come back, and now I think he will no longer
       come back.’ (A8:60)The negated q†ille form can be combined with the temporal adverbial par-
ticles referring to the present moment, such as heš ‘still’ and hal-diya ‘until
now’. These underscore that the action that is negated was expected to
happen at a point in the immediate past adjacent to the present moment,
e.g. heš-là °éle,} ""àz6x!; hal-díya là °éle,} ""àz6x!} These could be paraphrased:
We have waited for him until the present moment, when he was expected
to come, but he has not come at the expected time, so now let’s go.
                              the syntax of verbs                               665   It would not be appropriate to use the negated q†ille form là °éle if
there is still an expectation that the person will come. If there is such an
expectation the negated resultative form l5le ""6°ya would be used. The lat-
ter form asserts that he is currently not in a state of ‘having come’ but it
does not assert that this state is permanent. This is because, as remarked
in §15.3.7., the negative copula does not specify the permanency of the
state. It may denote either a permanent or a contingent state. The form
l5le ""6°ya, therefore, could be used if the speaker expects this state to be
temporary and assumes he will come at some point in the future. If the
construction is combined with the particle heš ‘still, yet’ (e.g. heš l5le ""6°ya ‘He
has not yet come’), the scope of the assertion is narrowed to the present
moment, i.e. at the present moment he is not in a state of ‘having come’,
which implies that he may come at some point in the future.
   Since a negative resultative such as l5le ""6°ya ‘He has not come’ has
generic temporal reference (‘at no time in the past’), it is normal to use
this construction with negative generic time adverbials such as ‘u-ga
‘never’, e.g.  (18) ‘ú-ga l7le ""ê°ya.} ‘He has never come.’
  (19) ‘ú-ga lát xêzy6lle?} ‘Have you not ever seen him?’In what follows we shall present various examples from direct speech in
the text corpus that contain resultative forms and q†ille/q6m-qa†6l forms that
should be translated by the English present perfect. The reasons that led
the speaker to choose one form rather than the other will be examined
in the light of the foregoing discussion.  (20) síg6n ""áti b7°i muxrùlux!} . . . mèra hàtx6t wíða?} mèra hot-ß†ìm6lle

forms all have the deictic copula, which draws the hearer’s attention to
a resultant state. In some cases, however, the enclitic copula is used in
assertions. This generally occurs in contexts where the assertion is for some
reason less informative. In many cases the enclitic copula is used when
the speaker wishes to give greater relative prominence to the contents of
an adjacent clause and so reduces the attention drawn to the clause with
the resultative construction. In (31) the speaker wishes to draw attention to
the purpose of her coming, expressed in the following dependent clause,
more than the fact that she has come. This applies also to the reply of her
interlocutor, in which the resultative also has an enclitic copula. Example
(32) exhibits a similar construction, in which the purpose clause is more
informative than the main verb:  (31) ""áy jal-jálde wírra ""èlle dìye} mèra lá-dri x7l6t gànux.} ""ána °í°6n mpal†ánnux

have fallen in love with you’ and ‘I have followed you’, which are presup-
posed facts:  (35) mèra ""ána bí°6nnux °í°6n bà°rux} w-ana-l7ð6n t-awètwa ""áti xày6n
       pal†ètwa mènni.} ‘She said “I have fallen in love with you and followed
       you, while not knowing that you would turn out to be treacherous
       to me.” ’ (A14:101)In (36) and (37) the lack of a deictic copula in the second clause reflects
the fact that these function as elaborations of the previous clause, rather
than prominent pieces of independent information:  (36) ""àna} hon-""ê°ya,} ríq6n qam-màmi.} ‘I have come, running away from
       my paternal uncle.’ (A25:42)
  (37) b-óma xéna ""á°eti †la-kawù°ra,} ‘íd6t k6slˆni.} ‘The day after tomorrow
       come to lunch, you are invited to our home.’ (A22:14)A different reason for a reduced level of informativeness of the resultative
construction is illustrated by (38). Here the clause ‘I have put the house
in order’ refers to an activity that the speaker performs every day and so
would be expected to perform:  (38) ""ám6r hà yèmmi} mùt mára?} ""ˆnile plíxa ""èdyo?} mèra bábi har-""àtit plíxa,}
       ""u-xmára-w tàwra,} ""u-""ána mquzqázt6n bˆ°a.} ‘He said “So, mother,
       what do you say? Who has worked today?” She said “My dear,

      in order.” ’ (A21:15)15.4.1.3. Function in Narrative
In the narrative sections of folktales in the text corpus the resultative form
is frequently used with the function of a preterite to relate a specific punc-
tual event in the past without any assertion of the existence of a resultant
state in the present. When it has this function, it is normally used with
the enclitic copula rather than the deictic copula. Since in narrative it
denotes a punctual event rather than a durable resultant state, it may be
used to express a chain of sequential events, e.g.  (1) qìmela} b-lèle} †ríp6lla Zìne} ""u-mù°y6lla,} núbl6lla k6s-M9mo.} núbl6lla k6s-
      M9mo.} dmìxela.} ‰ìšt5la,} zìpt6llela} †la-M9mo.} ‘At night they went and
      seized Zine and brought her, they took her to M>mo. They took
      her to M>mo. They slept. She woke up and pushed M>mo (out of
      bed). (A26:3)
  (2) nùbl6lle} sús6t Qára Tè≥din,} gríš6lle m-r6š-gêlla} m-xàla,} sí‰6lle ""o-d-áw
      šópe dìye} ""u-sìq5le.} síq5le m6xy5le l-t9ra.} ‘He took the horse of Qara
      Te≥din. He pulled it from the grass he was eating and tied his own
      in its place, then went up. He went up and knocked on the door.’
      (A26:29)
  (3) šqíl6lla †ása b-lˆle} ""u-núbl6lla zèdy6lla gu-ða-dˆrta.} šqíl6lla m6n-d-5-dˆrta,}
      núbl6lla zèdy6lla gu-ða-xèta.} ‘They took the bowl in the night, took it
      away and threw it into a house enclosure. They took it from that
      enclosure, took it away and threw it into another one.’ (A15:12)
  (4) ""áp-""awwa sìq5le gu-†úra,} m6n-xuráne díye píš5le gu-†úra xá-yoma yóme trè.}
      dmìxela} b-lˆle xá-ga} ""è°yela tré malàxe.} ‘So, he went up into the moun-
      tains with his friends and remained in the mountains one or two
      days. One night they went to sleep and two angels came.’ (A4:2)The copula is sometimes omitted from the participle when it has this
narrative preterite function. This typically occurs in a series of clauses
that open with a verb with the copula. The clause or clauses without the
copula express events that are closely sequential to that of the opening
clause. The purpose of the speaker is to present these as components of
one overall event rather than as a series of discrete events. The initial
verb in the chain is often a verb of movement or the verb qym ‘to arise’,
which in narrative frequently loses its original meaning and is used simply
to mark the onset of a new event, e.g.
670                             chapter fifteen  (5)   ""è°yela jmìye.} ‘They came and gathered together.’ (A22:2)
  (6)   ""è°y5le wìra.} ‘He came and entered.’ (A26:47)
  (7)   qím5le ""è°ya síqa l-gàre.} ‘He got up, came and went up onto the
        roof.’ (A26:40)
  (8)   qím5le mú°ya tùre.} ‘He got up and fetched twigs.’ (A20:3)
  (9)   ""ay-qìmt5la,} wíðta qàwa.} ‘She got up and made coffee.’ (A26:31)Normally in such chains of events the clause with the participle without
the copula has the same subject as the preceding clause, as is the case
in the examples above. When there is a change in subject a copula is
generally used, e.g.  (10) síq5le mèxya l-t9ra} ""u-plí††5la S6ttìye.} ‘He went up and knocked on
       the door and S6ttiye came out.’ (A26:29)
  (11) ""è°y5le tíwa b-dìw6n} ""u-náše kúlla tìwela} gu-dìw6n.} ‘He came and sat
       down in the reception room, and everybody else sat down in the
       reception room.’ (A26:63)These are not, however, absolute rules. The copula is occasionally omitted
when there is a change of subject in a chain of events (12) and even in
the first clause in a narrative sequence after direct speech (13)–(14):  (12) ""u-sìq5le} súse kèlya tàma.} ‘He went up and his horse stopped there.’
       (A26:28)
  (13) mèra m5°ítule kêsli!} mú°ye Bakúrko kèsla dìya.} ‘She said “Bring him
       to me”. They brought Bakurko to her.’ (A26:84)
  (14) ""o-náša sàwa} mère †la-d-ó-yala zòra,} mêre} ""ˆka t-áz6t?} ""ána ‘ú-duk°a lìtli.}
       t-áz6n gu-jàma.} xám6n gu-jàma.} ""áwwa qíma zíla l-bˆ°e díye} ""o-náša gò‰a.}
       ‘The old man said to the youth, he said “Where will you go?” “I
       have nowhere to go. I’ll go to the mosque. I’ll stay in the mosque.”
       The elderly man got up and went to his house.’ (A17:5–6)In the case of a sequence of two verbs that are closely related and pre-
sented as a tightly knit unit in the same intonation group, the copula is
sometimes put only on the second participle of the sequence. This is
most often found where the first verb of the sequence expresses move-
ment, e.g.  (15) ""áwwa gáw‰a díya síq5le l-Nìnwe,} dí‰a ""ê°y5le.} ‘Her husband went up
       to Nineveh, then returned and came back.’ (A13:2)

       (A18:7)
  (18) qlíba ßêly5le.} ‘He went back down.’ (A30:32)
  (19) dmíxe-u †lìyela.} ‘They lay down and slept.’ (A4:50)In narratives the preterite q†il5le form is used interchangeably with the
q†ille/q6m-qa†6l form, which is the other main narrative verb form. The
narrator constantly shifts from one form to the other. These shifts often
coincide with some kind of reorientation in the narrative, especially where
there is a change in subject and the narrator directs attention to another
character, e.g.  (20) qím5le lˆle šètya qáwa.} tíw5le l-xáß6 súse dìye} ""u-dí‰5le ßèly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na.}
       ""5-""7na t-ìle ""è°ya qamáye réša.} Qára Té≥din dì‰‰e} °éle bˆ°a} ""ám6r hà}

       on the back of his horse and went back down to the spring, the
       spring to which he had come previously. Qara Te≥din returned
       home and said “Ah, wife, where is the guest?” ’ (A26:32–33)
  (21) síq5le l-gàre} maxzóy6lle Jazíra Bòta.} Zìne} ""u-""án-xaddamyá°a díya ßléla
       r6š-""ˆna.} ‘He went up onto the roof to show him Jazira Bota. Zine
       and her maid-servants went down to the spring.’ (A26:40)
  (22) ""ê°y5le,} qam-t8r6t b7°a tíw5le hàd6x.} bábe díye °èle.} ‘He came and
       sat down in front of the door of the house. His father came.’
       (A26:10)

       Zìne} mattúla gu-""íð6t Qára Tè≥din.} ‘Qara Te≥din went and put his
       hand in the hand of M>mo. M>mo took the locks of Zine and
       put them in the hand of Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:50)On some occasions there is no change in subject across the transition
from one verbal form to the other. In such cases some kind of reorienta-
tion on another dimension of the discourse can usually be discerned. In
(24), for example, the shift from q†il5le for q†ille coincides with the start of
a chain of clauses that narrate a new event, i.e. the eating of the third
fox cub. In (25) the clause ‘In this way they held the wedding’ contain-
ing the q†ille form wídla is not presented as an event that is sequential to
the previously mentioned events of ‘bringing them up with drum and
pipe’ and ‘firing rifles’ but rather it recapitulates these preceding specific
672                               chapter fifteenevents by a general statement. In (26) the section beginning ‘They played
three times and Mir-Zandin lost’, which contains q†ille forms, may also
be regarded as constituting a break in the tight chain of events of the
previous clauses. Its function is to elaborate on the event of playing chess
rather than to carry the discourse forward with new events. In a similar
manner the clause with the resultative form in (27) elaborates on the
preceding clause with the q†ille form:  (24) qímela ""ap-""o-tré prìm6lle,} xìl6lle.} ""ím6t xílla ""ap-""o-trè,} píšla xà-šab°a,} tré

       lá-mßele b-M9mo.} ‘Now, he called for M>mo and he came and sat

  (27) wírre gu-bòye.} gu-bóye díye m†úšy6lla gáne dìye.} ‘He went into his hole.
       He hid himself in his hole’ (A1:15)The transition in the narrative between the two verbal forms is also
attested where the narrator repeats the mention of an event of particular
importance in the story. The shift of verbal form is no doubt exploited
in such circumstances to mark off the repeated clause more sharply from
what precedes in order to give it prominence, e.g.  (28) ""ó-yom6 t-íle plí†a málka m-bˆ°a,} ""ó-yoma bróne díye mì°5le.} ""ó-yoma mìtle
       bróne díye.} ‘On the day that the king left home, on that day his son

  (30) ""áwwa zdìl5le.} zdìlle,} mère . . . } ‘He became afraid. He became afraid
       and said . . .’ (A21:33)
                            the syntax of verbs                             673Certain verbs exhibit a clear tendency to have the preterite expressed by
q†ille rather than the resultative in narrative. A common feature of this
set of verbs is that they are typically matrix verbs that have a clause as
their complement. The most conspicuous of these verbs is ""mr ‘to say’.
When this introduces direct speech, which may be considered to be its
complement, the verb is regularly in the q†ille form: mère ‘He said’, mèra
‘She said’, etc. Other matrix verbs that are generally put in the q†ille form
when preterite in narratives include:m-šry ‘to begin’:  (31) mšuréla bxàya.} ‘She began to weep.’ (A4:42)
  (32) šuréla ßràxa.} ‘She began to shout.’ (A25:82)ßbr ‘to dare’:  (33) lá ßbírra mßuwêtla.} ‘She did not dare to speak.’ (A24:40)
  (34) ""áp-xa mènna lá-ßbirre rhíwle gu-dìw6n.} ‘Nobody dared speak to him

       of the horse, but the horse did not move.’ (A28:33)

       him) by begging him “Man, these are my brothers.” ’ (A12:10)
  (39) kízla bróni lá-wuð hátxa mêndi.} ‘She tried (to stop him by saying)
       “Son, don’t do such a thing.” ’ (A14:6)
  (40) kízle d6-mxíli xa-xèna!} ‘He tried (to persuade him by saying) “Strike
       me again!” ’ (A52:24)The deictic copula is sometimes used with the resultative participle in
narratives. In such cases the form has its usual non-narrative function of
denoting a resultant state. It is generally used to present the background
674                             chapter fifteento the main narrative line against which the punctual narrative events
occurred. The deictic copula here takes the past time reference of the
surrounding context. It is often appropriate to translate such background
clauses with the English pluperfect. Examples:  (41) ""u-d6ryále gàne} gu-bêrke,} sxày5le.} súse díye hóle mrúpy6lle gu-màrga.}

       angel) said “Bless your father and mother. May each live another
       fifty years.” The angels got up and returned.’ (A4:57–60)Occasionally the deictic copula is used when the construction expresses
a punctual event that is sequential to what precedes. The effect of this is
to draw particular attention to the event and mark it off distinctly from
what precedes. In (48) the main motivation appears to be to give particular
attention to the event due to its unexpectedness. It is not usual for a barber
to have to bring a ladder to cut a person’s hair. In (49) the deictic copula
is used to mark the onset of a section narrating a battle between the hero
and his enemy. The section begins with the narrative formula mara ‘(The
story) says’, which is generally used as a device to mark boundaries in the
discourse (§15.4.2.3 examples 19–23).  (48) tíw5le Zàlo} q6m-t8r6t qáßre dìye} ""o-˙allàqa} hóle mú°y6lla xa-semàlta}

       also him. He and that man fought. They continued fighting until
       dawn. At dawn, the break of day, he disappeared.’ (A12:10)The use of the q†il5le construction in narratives to express sequential
events in the past seems prima facie to be unusual. It is unlikely that the
normal function of q†il5le to express present resultant states has been
here exploited to give vividness to past events. More effective means of
expressing such vividness are available to the narrator in the q†ille form,
which expresses events in the immediate past, or the perfective qa†6l,
which expresses punctual events taking place in the present moment.
The resultant states expressed by the present perfect q†il5le, moreover,
are temporally unbounded and would more naturally be used to express
temporally overlapping states rather than be concatenated to express
sequential situations.
676                           chapter fifteen   A more satisfactory explanation is to regard this function of the q†il5le
form in narratives to have originated in the use of the present perfect as
an evidential verbal form. In many languages present perfect verb forms
have developed the function of expressing past events for which the speaker
has no direct evidence. Such forms are used when the speaker has not
witnessed the event first hand, but has acquired knowledge of the event
only by hearsay report or by inference from indirect evidence. The pro-
pensity of the present perfect to develop this function in languages is due
to the fact that it does not present an event directly but only through its
results (Comrie 1976: 108–110; Aikhenvald 2004: 112–115). The stimulus
for the C. Barwar NENA present perfect to have its function extended in
this way was probably given by language contact. A likely candidate for
the source of this influence is Turkish. This language has an evidential
verbal form (distinguished by the affix -mi{), which is associated mor-
phologically and functionally with the perfect. A relevant feature of the
Turkish evidential form is that it is used in fictional narratives with no
basis in reality, such as myths and folktales (Slobin and Aksu 1982; Aksu
and Slobin 1986; Aksu-Koç 1988: 25), which are the type of narrative
text where the q†il5le preterite is most often encountered in the C. Barwar
dialect. A perfect verb form extended to express the evidential denotes
perfective events rather than present states and so can be used felicitously
to express sequential narrative events.
   It should be noted, however, that in the C. Barwar NENA dialect, it
appears that the q†il5le perfect form is not used with an evidential func-
tion outside of narrative contexts. In contexts that would typically trigger
an evidential form, informants use both q†ille and q†il5le with their usual
distinction in temporal-aspectual function, e.g.  (50) már5le xóni ""è°y5le qedàmta.} ‘He says that my brother came this
       morning.’
  (51) mabyónela xóni ""è°y5le qedàmta.} ‘It seems that my brother came this
       morning.’
  (52) már5le xóni dìya °éle.} ‘He says that my brother has just come.’

difficult to reconcile with an evidential function, which is characteristically
used when a speaker has indirect evidence of an event in which he/she
has not participated, e.g.

narrative verbal form, characteristic of fictitious discourse, which originally
developed in imitation of the use of the Turkish evidential verbal forms
with -mi{ in fictitious narrative. It did not, however, come to be used as a
fully functional evidential form that could be used outside of narrative.","[700, 701, 702, 703, 704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716]"
"15.1.7.2. Recent Past Events
In conversational discourse the normal function of the q6m-qa†6l form is to
express with perfective aspect the occurrence of a punctual event in the
recent past. The margin of the recent past may extend up to the present
moment. The form may be used, therefore, when the endpoint of the event
is witnessed in the present moment. It is appropriate to translate the form
in such contexts by the English perfect of recent past. Examples of this
are found in the text corpus, mainly in sections of direct speech, e.g.   (1) ""áti q6m-xalßàtli} m6n-d-áwwa mò°a.} ‘You have saved me from death.’
       (A14:35)

    In many NENA dialects the prefix has an /a/ vowel (qam-). In Barwar the attenuation
of the /a/ to /6/ is regular and the form contrasts with the particle qam ‘before’, which
generally preserves the /a/ (§2.3.5.). In the C. Sulemaniyya and C. Sanandaj dialects the
auxiliary verb *qadd6m has developed into the form tam- with the elision of the first syllable
and devoicing of the medial *d.

      whether we would come to help you or not.’ (A48:6)When it has this function, it is sometimes combined with the deictic copula,
which refers to the grammatical subject of the verb, e.g.  (5) hóla q6m-qa†lìle.} ‘They have killed him.’ (A28:27)The results of such events that occur in the very recent past are likely to
have some relevance in the present. It is important to note, however, that
the q6m-qa†6l form does not assert the existence of a resultant state in the
present, rather it is only an implicature. If the speaker wishes to assert
that such a resultant state holds at present, the compound form consisting
of resultative participle and copula is used (§15.4.1.). This applies also
to constructions with verbs with stative actionality such as yð"" ‘to know’,
where the q6m-qa†6l form is most appropriately translated by the English
present, e.g.  (6) mère ""ˆk5le b5°7xu?} mèra fèll6n dùk°a.} mère q6m-y>ðênne.} ‘He said “Where
      is your house?” She said “In such-and-such a place.” He said “I
      see” (literally: I have (now) know it).’ (A22:14)15.1.7.3. Past Perfective in Narrative
The q6m-qa†6l form is used in narrative as a preterite to refer to punctual
events in the past with a perfective aspect, e.g.
  With direct pronominal object suffixes:  (1) °éla q6m-mparqíli m-gu-""i°à°ux.} ‘They came and saved me from your

  (10) q6m-yálli šùla.} ‘He gave me a job.’ (A23:34)On some occasions in a narrative the q6m- prefix is omitted from the form
in verbs that follow an initial q6m-qa†6l form in a closely knit sequence.
The resulting reduced forms consist only of the qa†6l base and L-suffixes,
but still have past time reference, e.g.  (11) °éla jênne,} q6m-šaqlìle,} nablìle,} mattìle} ""al-†úr6t Jazíra Bòta.} ‘Jinn came
       and took him. They took him away and put him on the mountain

The q6m-qa†6l form may be used in the protasis of a conditional construc-
tion. In such contexts it may have not only past, but also present or future
time reference, e.g.  (1)   ""6n- kúlla q6m-maxíla b6rrèy} ""áw q6m-dawqíle ""o-q7sa t-íle be-pàlga,} °èla}

        they have broken up all their group or have seized the piece of
        wood that is in the middle, if one of those who are outside has

  (2)   ""6n-š8r6† díyi q6m-y>ðêtla,} xo-b-gawrànnux.} ""6n-š8r6† díyi là q6m-y>ðètla,}
        réšux mattánne gu-d-yàha káwe} t-íla pyàša.} ‘If you know (the answer
612                                 chapter fifteen         to) my challenge, I shall indeed marry you. If you do not know
         (the answer to) my challenge, I shall put your head in that opening
         that remains.’ (A25:62)15.1.8. q6m-qa†6lwa
The q6m-qa†6l form may be augmented with the past suffix -wa. As is the
case with the q6m-qa†6l form, the q6m-qa†6lwa is used only with L-suffixes.
    The basic function of the q6m-qa†6lwa form is to denote an event in the
past with the deictic temporal reference point in the present, just as is the
case with the q6m-qa†6l form. The difference between the two forms is that
in conversational discourse q6m-qa†6l refers to the recent past, the margin
of which may extend up to the present moment, whereas the q6m-qa†6lwa
form is detached temporally from the present. The action expressed by
the q6m-qa†6lwa form, however, is not necessarily in the remote past. It
may have occurred a few minutes prior to the present moment. There
is, in fact, a degree of overlap between the absolute temporal reference
of q6m-qa†6l and q6m-qa†6lwa. Informants, however, tend to judge that it
is not felicitous to use the q6m-qa†6l form to refer to an event that took
place on the previous day or prior to it, whereas the time reference of
q6m-qa†6lwa can be extended indefinitely into the past. The relationship
between q6m-qa†6l and q6m-qa†6lwa in conversational discourse may be
summarized as follows:(i) Immediate past temporal reference
      q6m-qa†6l:
          ‘I have just now seen him’                 diya q6m-xaz6nne(ii) Recent past temporal reference
       q6m-qa†6l:
           ‘I saw him five minutes ago’3             q6m-xaz6nne qam xamša daqiqe
       q6m-qa†6lwa:
           ‘I saw him five minutes ago’              q6m-xaz6nwale qam xamša daqiqe
  3
     It should be noted that in English the present perfect is not used in a clause containing
certain time adverbials although the event has relevance for the present moment.

which is also used as a preterite, as is usual in narrative:  (1) ""ína báte qám°a †ìna-w5wa.} ""u-píšwala t-amrèxwa qàßre,} béna ""áwwa

      our relatives, we knocked red eggs together at half past four in the
      morning. Then we went and ate breakfast.’ (B15:9)The q6m-qa†6lwa form is rarely found in narrative sections of stories in the
text corpus. When it is used in this context, it tends to be used to denote
an event that took place at a point in the past that is detached temporally
from that of the events in the surrounding narrative line, in that it took
place at some period in the remoter past. It does not denote a resultant
state that acts as the background against which the narrative takes places
and so should not be characterized as a pluperfect or past perfect. Such
a state, however, may be an implicature and it is often appropriate to
translate the form by the English pluperfect, e.g.  (3) béna ""urxa-""ùrxa,} q6m-jayêrwala.} ßlèla} jòre.} mère m6šxàne!} káde m6šxàne!}
      ßléla b-júlle dìye,} šqál6lla mšày6lla.} ‘Now, on the way, he urinated (at

614                          chapter fifteen15.1.9. ßadle
The irregular form ßadle ‘He is afraid’, which is conjugated with L-suffixes,
is used to express imperfective aspect to refer to the actual present. It is
treated like verbs derived from the present base and can take the prefix
""i- and the affix wa in a variety of forms with imperfective function. The
""i- prefix is optionally added when it has a habitual imperfective aspect.
The wa affix gives the form a past time reference:  ßadle              ‘He is afraid (now)’               = qa†6l
  ( ""i-)ßadle        ‘He is afraid (habitually)         = ""i-qa†6l
  ßadwale            ‘He was afraid’                    = qa†6lwa
  (""i-)ßadwale       ‘He was afraid (habitually)        = ""i-qa†6lwaThe forms without the ""i- prefix may also be used deontically, e.g. la-ßàdlux
‘Do not be afraid!’ (B9:26). Perfective past or future tenses can only be
expressed by the regular verb zd"".","[648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653]"
