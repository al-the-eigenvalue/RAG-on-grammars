When          only        one      of    these        phonemes           occurs          in       asequence,             the       syllabic                and     non-syilabic                   phonemes           are    com-—pletely          in    complementary                         distribution.

The     contrasts             arise          when     two       of    thesephonemes          occur             in       succession.                 Even        here       they    are        restrictedto    certain          environments.

Taking             the    former        pair          as      anexample,          we       may          have       /iy/       only       when        preceded          by     a    consonantand     followed            by a vowel.

Some            words       showing          this       contrast             in       theposttonic           syllable               are /tdniw/                 'Miwok',         /geyisiw/                    ‘sell      it!',

             3.8.         Vowel-coloring.                          An understanding                   of     the       vowel-coloring            morphophonemes                      is    probably,             more       than        any     otheraspect         of    the       morphophonemics,                         the    key    to       the    proper           seg-mentation            and        analysis              of Washo           forms.           These       are        morpho-phonemes            that,          when     followed               by    a vowel,          are       themselvesrepresented               by       zero,     but         which          may    affect          the    vowel         to    changeits    quality.                 Vowels           so    affected           by    these          morphophonemes                  thusconstitute               link       phonemes             that       resist          non-arbitrary                  segmenta-tion     on     the       phonemic           level.                For    example,             in    the     form1°    fheb          /léhep/               ‘my head’,the    fact         that        the       stressed            vowel       is /e/,;         and not /i/,                  isa

miheb           /mihep/               ‘your head’.
But    the      fact           that    this           vowel        is /e/,          and not,          say,        /a/,     is
@ property               of     the    stem;           contrast,              for    example,1° hl           /1éh41/               ‘my leg‘.
