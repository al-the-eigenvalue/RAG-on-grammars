  9.3       Questions
  Questions are of the following two types:
• In a yes–no question, there are only a couple of natural answers. For example, the
  likely answers to the English question Will you help me? are either Yes or No (or some
  expansion or equivalent).
• In a content question, the range of likely answers is broader. For example, given the
  English question Who will help me?, there are numerous possible answers depending
  on the circumstances: Alice, Bert, Charlie, Donna, etc.
  In many languages, yes–no questions and content questions are formed in different
  ways. In English, for example, content questions use a word such as where?, what?,
  why?, etc., while yes–no questions are formed by changing word order: Can you hear
  me? Yurok too has two different methods for forming the two types of questions.",[123]
"9.3.1.2       Questions expecting a negative answer
Some questions presuppose that a negative answer is likely. An English example is Don’t
you see the hawk?, to which a likely answer is No, I don’t see it. In Yurok, much as in
English, such questions are formed with negatives. Examples are in (163).
(163)     Questions expecting a negative answer
          (a) Neemee hes newoom’ kuech kue ’ne-ka’ar?

              “Aren’t you ashamed?”                                                  YL 1951In (163c), the addressee may or may not actually be ashamed. In asking this question,
the speaker assumes that the addressee should have been ashamed but isn’t.

9.3.2 Content questions
Unlike yes–no questions, content questions seek a more open-ended answer to ques-
tions like “who?”, “when?”, “where?”, etc. They can be classiﬁed according to the type of
information they seek, and also according to their form. In Yurok, content questions are
formed using one of the question words tee’now, tee’neeshoo, and kues. Among these,
kues is the most ﬂexible.","[125, 126]"
"
  9.3.1 Yes–no questions
  Yes–no questions are formed using the question particle hes, positioned either at the
  end of the sentence (this is less common) or (more often) after the ﬁrst word or phrase
  of the sentence. The examples below are divided into two groups: neutral questions,
  whose answer might be “yes” or “no” (§9.3.1.1), and questions whose expected answer
  is “no” (§9.3.1.2).",[123]
"  9.3.1.1       Neutral yes–no questions
  The most common position for hes is immediately after the ﬁrst word of the sentence,
  as in (160).",[123]
"
2.6      Particles
The term particle refers to a set of ﬁve different word classes which share two features:
all of them have relatively few words, ranging from only two articles to a few dozen
preverbs; and in all cases they cannot be used on their own to form utterances. Particles
occur only with other words. For example, since you can answer a question with just
an adverb, an adverb is not a particle: if someone asks where you’re going, you can just
answer lekwsee “outside”. A noun is not a particle because if someone asks what you want
to eat, you can say nepuy “salmon” by itself. But you cannot say words like keetee, ’ochkaa,
k’ee, or kwelekw on their own without being part of a larger phrase or sentence. The ﬁve
Yurok word classes that can be regarded as particles are detailed in §§2.6.1–2.6.5.",[51]
" 10.2.1         Verbs in no’om- “how long”
 Verbs that begin with the relative root no’om- answer (or ask) the question “how long?”
 They typically refer to a distance, as in the examples in (189), where ’oteesh “a foot (in
 length)” and k’e-yah “your belly” indicate the length.
 (189)     (a) ’Oteesh no’omel’.
               “It was a foot long.”                                                           FS 1951 (YL)

 10.2.2         Verbs in son- “how”
 Verbs that begin with the relative root son- (or its variants sern-, soo-, or serr-) answer
 (or ask) the question “how?” They refer to a manner of being or doing, and must be
 used with a word or phrase that expresses the manner. For example, as in (191), the
 verb serrnerh “be (a particular) color, it is colored (thus)” requires an expression like
 won “differently”.
 (191)     Won nee kee serrnerh k’e-wa’aw.
           “Your ﬂoor will be a different color.”                                              JJ 2006 (AG) In the common expression in (192), skuy’ “good” likewise expresses manner with the
 verb soneenepek’ “I feel (a particular way)”.
 (192)     Skuy’ soneenepek’.
           “I feel good.”                                                                      JJ 2006 (AG) And the verb soonekw “go (in a particular direction, of a trail)” in (193) requires an ex-
 pression like pechkue “upriver” to express the direction.
 (193)     Pechkue soonekw kue laas.
           “The trail goes upriver.”                                                         GM 2004 (AG)¹ Linguists who study the Algonquian languages use this term because the meaning of elements like son-, tom-,
  or weno’om- is said to relate to the additional element in the sentence.

10.2.3        Verbs in tom- “how much”
Verbs that begin with the relative root tom- answer (or ask) the question “how much?”
They typically refer to an amount or quantity, and require an amount expression or a
place-holder like kues “how (much)?” or wek “this”. Examples of tomoyek’ “I am (a par-
ticular age or size)” are given in (194a–b).
(194)   (a) Wek tomoyek’.
            “I am this tall, I am this old.”                                      FS 1980 (PP)
        (b) Yo na’mee lok keech tom’.
            “He is now two years old.”                                                 YL 1951Other similar verbs are tomeek’ “it is (a particular depth)”, tomonemek’ “I take (a particular
amount)”, and tompeyok’ “I eat (a particular amount)”. In all cases the implication of the
root tom-, unless otherwise speciﬁed, is that the amount is relatively large.","[135, 136]"
"¹ Pronouns (like nek) are almost always preverbal.
² Note also that kue negeneech is explicitly marked as contrastive via the particle tue’, which can be translated
  “but” and highlights a contrasting noun.

seen in (112-113) on pages 78-78 above, cho’ can be used with ﬁrst-person and third-
person verbs to express exhortation (“must, should”).
    Alternatively, to urge a group that includes the speaker to do something, a construc-
tion with chyue kee (or chyue kue) is often used. This is shown in (158).

"7.1 Background
There are several important differences between the Yurok and English systems of time
reference. One concerns basic tense categories. In English, the basic categories are
past vs. present vs. future: “I saw” vs. “I see” vs. “I will see”. Many languages have an
English-style three-way set, but many other languages — including Yurok — have differ-
ent systems. It is possible to distinguish past-time and future-time preverbs in Yurok,
but the basic system is more nuanced.
    A second important difference has to do with present vs. past time. In English,
whenever you use a verb you must choose between a present-time form (I see) or a
past-time form (I saw), among other verb forms. A distinction between present and
past is obligatory in English grammar. But in Yurok, depending on context, verbs may
express either present or past time; for example, newook’ can mean either “I see” or “I
(recently) saw”. The context will usually make the intended meaning clear.
    A third important difference concerns aspect. Linguists use this term to describe
such concepts as starting and completing an action, as well as the viewpoint that a
speaker chooses on an action being described (for example, depicting it as ongoing or
unitary). You do not need to know this terminology, but the concepts sometimes play a
key role in Yurok preverb choice.
    Table 7.1 on page 65 lists the eight Yurok categories of time reference described
in this chapter, with the frequency of each preverb. By far the most frequent is keech;
second is kee. Many preverbs of time are omitted from Table 7.1 and are not discussed
here. They would be included in a complete study of Yurok grammar, though some are
poorly documented, making it hard to understand all their nuances.

and cultural leaders on linguistic and cultural documentation. He and his colleagues recorded over a dozen
hours of Yurok narratives and songs using early recording technology, beginning in 1902; he also transcribed
dozens of other narratives and much information about vocabulary and grammar. In the 1930s and 1940s he
worked extensively with Robert Spott; they coauthored Yurok narratives in 1942.

of examples of each preverb in a corpus of over 6,000 sentences (as of July 2014)
     It is not essential to learn the terms in Table 7.1; the key point is how the preverbs
are used. This is described in §§7.2–7.4; combinations of keech with other preverbs are
described in §7.5.2. The categories of time reference in Table 7.1 also play a role in Yurok
negation and directed motion, topics which will be discussed in §§8.2–8.3.
     The ﬁrst column in Table 7.1 identiﬁes the reference time: past, present, or future.
For example, ’ochkaa is said to have present reference; it is present-referring. This term
indicates the kind of adverb that can be used together with each category. Past-referring
categories can be used with adverbs like chmeyaan “yesterday” or heekon “formerly”;
present-referring categories can be used with adverbs like we’yk’oh “now, today”; and
the future-referring preverb kee can be used with adverbs like ’owook “tomorrow”. This
is illustrated explicitly in (71–74).
     The examples in (71) show that ho and ma have past reference. The adverbs heekon
“long ago” and kohchee “once (one time)” explicitly anchor the reference to a past time.

 perception (ko’moyom’ “he heard”, newook’ “I saw”). The situation described by keet must
 therefore be present at the time of perception.
     Finally, the examples in (74) shows that kee has future reference.

 Three past-referring categories are described in this section: the general past; and the
 situational and punctual past, which are expressed through preverbs. These terms
 are explained in (75).¹
 (75)      (a) The term general past applies to verbs with no time-reference preverbs,
               which can refer generally to the present or the past. For example, ko’moyok’
               can mean “I heard it”; you might ask ko’moyom’ hes? “did you hear it?”
           (b) The situational past preverb ho indicates that a past action or situation
               existed, but implies nothing about its ending. At the relevant past time,
               the action or situation might not have been over (it might have been con-
               tinuing). Ho is used in the intended meaning “was doing (something)”.
           (c) The punctual past preverb ma indicates that a past action took place in
               one moment, or is understood as completed at a moment in the past. If the
               intended meaning is “went and did (something)”, ma is used.
     The general past category in (75a) is very frequent; sentences that refer to past time
 often lack preverbs of time, especially in narratives describing successive events. This is
 shown in (76) with consecutive sentences from a story told by Florence Shaughnessy.
 (76)      (a) Hehlkue nee raayor’.
               “He ran along the bank.”
           (b) Kwesee kolchee kol’ ’okw’ hehlkue, neskwee ’emehl raayor’ kue ’yoch.
               “And once he was somewhere on the river bank, (and) the boat was passing
               near him.”                                                      FS 1951 (YL) Each verb in (76) refers to an event in a past-time narrative sequence; none occurs with
 a preverb of time.
     One way to contrast the past-time preverbs ho and ma in (75b–c) is in their use
 in answering questions. This is shown in Table 7.2 on page 67. If you ask what was¹ Linguists might use the terms imperfective and perfective rather than situational and punctual, but
  the terms used here may be clearer. Note that Yurok does have other past-time preverbs, such as ’ap, but these
  are less frequent than the two discussed here.

"10.2.4        Verbs in weno’om- “how far”
Verbs that begin with the relative root weno’om- answer (or ask) the question “how far?”
They typically refer to a location (in space or time), and are used only in sentences where
an additional word or phrase indicates the location. In (195a), for example, the location
is indicated by wee’ “that (place)”, and in (195b) it is expressed by poyew noohl “far ahead”.
(195)   (a) Kel’ kem wee’ ho weno’omuerem’.
            “You too swam there.”                                                      YL 1951
        (b) Poyew noohl weno’omor’ kue mewah.
            “The boy is running far ahead.”                                            YL 1951The relative roots no’om- and weno’om- are similar; the difference is that weno’om- verbs
express how far along something has moved, while no’om- expresses how long some-
thing is (not necessarily in motion). For example, while no’omek’ means “it (a worm-
or roped-shaped object) is long”, weno’omoksee’hl “it is a (speciﬁed) season” refers to the
metaphorical motion of time.",[136]
"  2.4 Pronouns
  A pronoun is a kind of word that stands in place of a noun. It may be the subject or object
  of a verb, for example, but its reference may differ from sentence to sentence, depending
  on context. English pronouns include words like me, that, and what. Yurok pronouns are
  of three types:
• personal pronouns refer to “I”, “you”, “me”, etc.: nek, kel’, nekah, kelew, etc.
• demonstrative pronouns refer to a third person, that is, “s/he”, “that one”, “them”, etc.:
  yo’, wee’eeet, etc.
• question (or interrogative) pronouns include words like kues “how?”, tee’now “who?”,
  tee’neeshoo “what?”, and other words in forming content questions (§9.3.2).

 To ask when, two patterns are common: kues cho’ and kues noohl. The difference between
 them is not certain, though probably kues cho’ means “at what time?” while kues noohl¹ At least one Modern Yurok speaker often used tee’neeshoo, not kues, with this verb.

In Yurok, meanings like “be” and “have” are expressed quite differently from the way they
are expressed in English. There is no Yurok verb or other word that has the same range
of uses as English be or have. Here a few important constructions that partly correspond
to thse English verbs are described: descriptive sentences (§10.1.1), nominal sentences
(§10.1.2), posture constructions (§10.1.3), and possession sentences (§10.1.4).","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"

  7.5.1 Preverb comparisons
  The differences in meaning among the time-reference categories above can be subtle.
  Differences between the following pairs are brieﬂy described here:
• General present vs. resultative keech; see (96)
• Resultative keech vs. durative present ’ochkaa; see (97–100)
• Durative present ’ochkaa vs. inceptive keet; see (101)
• Resultative keech vs. inceptive keet; see (102–103)
• Inceptive keet vs. prospective keetee; see (104)
• Prospective keetee vs. modal future kee; see (105)      The difference between keech and the general present (with no preverb) is illustrated
  in (96).  (96)    (a)   Komchuechek’.
                “I know you.”                                                           JJ 2004 (JB)
          (b) Keech komchuechek’.
              “I know you now.”                                                         JJ 2004 (JB)  The example in (96a) was given as a good, positive answer to the question Komchuepa’
  hes? “Do you know me?” The example in (96b) would be appropriate if the speaker at
  ﬁrst could not remember the other person, and then suddenly recalled: “Oh, now I know
  you!” That is, keech signals a change of situation from not knowing to knowing.
     The difference between keech and ’ochkaa is illustrated in (97–100).  (97)    (a)   Keech swoo’mel’.
                “He stinks (from contact with something).”                                   YL 1951
          (b) ’Ochkaa swoo’mel’.
              “He stinks (naturally).”                                                       YL 1951  (98)    (a)   Keech no’oyek’.
                “I have shoes on.”                                                     JJ 2006 (AG)
          (b) ’Ochkaa no’oyek’.
              “I am putting on shoes.”                                                 JJ 2006 (AG)  (99)    (a)   Keech teykelew.
                “Something bit me.”                                                    FS 1980 (PP)
          (b) Nek ’ochkaa teykelew.
              “I’m biting.”                                                         GT 2003 (YLCB)  (100)   (a)   Keech nue mega’ahskehl.
                “They’ve gone spear-ﬁshing.”                                           FS 1980 (PP)
 74        /       Time reference with preverbs
           (b) ’Ochkaa kertkerk’.
               “I’m pole-ﬁshing.”                                                           GT 2003 (YLCB) In each case in (97–100), in the (a) example keech is appropriate because there was a
 recent change of state. In each (b) example, ’ochkaa is appropriate because the action is
 presented as ongoing without a necessary starting or ending point.
     The difference between ’ochkaa and keet is illustrated by the example in (101), with
 two consecutive sentences.
 (101)     ’Ochkaa pekwoluem’ kue ’w-oleehl.
           Keet holeem’ ’we-no’os.
           “She’s peeling her hazel sticks.
           She’s starting to make a baby basket.”                                                JJ 2007 (LC) The ﬁrst sentence above, with ’ochkaa, describes an ongoing action (peeling hazel sticks)
 that may have been underway for a while; the second sentence indicates that this action
 is the ﬁrst step in making a baby basket.
     The difference between keech and keet is illustrated by the examples in (102–103).
 The verb kweskwesek’ in (102) means “I have a cold”. In (102a) the situation has changed
 so that the speaker already has a cold, whereas in (102b) the speaker is starting to have
 a cold, or is about to have a cold.
 (102)     (a) Keech kweskwesek’.
               “I have a cold.”                                                                 JJ 2006 (AG)
           (b) Keet kweskwesek’.
               “I’m catching a cold.”                                                           JJ 2006 (AG) The verb neskwechook’ in (103) means “arrive”. In (103a), the situation has changed so
 that the addressee has now arrived and is here. In (103b), the subject is starting to arrive
 (lit. “come near”) but has not yet arrived; actually having arrived would be expressed
 with keech.
 (103)     (a) Keech neskwechoom’.
               “(Finally) you’ve arrived.”                                                      AF 2002 (JB)
           (b) Keet neskwechok’w.
               “He’s coming.”                                                                 MM 1927 (ES)      The difference between keet and keetee is illustrated in (104).¹
 (104)     (a) Keet kwechkeesh.
               “He’s defecating.”                                                           FD ∼1962 (WB)
           (b) Keetee kwechkeeshek’.
               “I’m just about to defecate.”                                                FD ∼1962 (WB) As the translations indicate, keetee signiﬁes that the verbal action has not yet begun,
 while keet means it has begun.
     Finally, the future uses of kee differ from uses of keetee in two important ways. First,
 kee often has a nuance that suggests the English translation “shall” — it can convey a¹ The speaker in these examples used a more colloquial English translation than the one printed in (104).

with ﬁrst-person and second-person subjects. This is in contrast with keetee, which sim-
ply expresses a prediction about the future, and is typical with impersonal verbs or verbs
with inanimate subjects.
    Second, whereas keetee is often associated with a prediction for the near future or an
impending event, and can thus often be translated “about to”, kee carries no such impli-
cation. For example, in (105), the syntactic context in each case makes the time of the
verb with kee entirely indeﬁnite.(105)    (a)    Nek kwelekw neemee komchuemek’ kwen kol’ kee nepek’.
                “I don’t know when I will eat.”                                              JJ 2007 (LC)
         (b) To’ kee yekchoh wey’ mocho keech ho nuue’moh.
             “We will tell it (the place) to you when we have arrived.”                            YL 19517.5.2 Combinations of keech and another preverb
Resultative keech can be combined with past-time and future-time preverbs. In each case
the meaning of the resulting combination is the sum of its elements: it means that the
76      /     Time reference with preverbs
subject of the verb is now in a state or circumstance (keech) in which he or she was doing
(ho), did (ma), or can do (kee) something.
   A common combination is keech ho. In many cases a good translation is just “have
done it”. For example, if someone asks “What are you doing?”, you might answer with a
keech ho sentence. Examples are in (106).
(106)   Examples of keech ho
        (a) Keech ho nep’ puuek.
            “He’s been eating deer.”                                         MM 1927 (ES)
        (b) Kel’ hes keech ho helomeyem’?
            “Have you danced yet?”                                                YL 1951
        (c) Kol’ keech ho hohkuemek’.
            “I’ve been working.”                                             FS 1951 (RHR)
        (d) Keech ho sloyhlkek’.
            “I’ve been ﬂattening eels.”                                       FS 1980 (PP)
        (e) Keech ho wey ’w-o’omepek’.
            “He had ﬁnished making his ﬁre.”                               DW 1906 (ALK)    A second combination, keech ma, does not mean “have been doing it” but more sim-
ply “has done it”, somewhat analogous to the English expression. An event happened in
the past (ma), but its effect is still present now (keech). Examples are in (107).
(107)   Examples of keech ma
        (a) Keech ma saawelek’.
            “I’ve gotten cold.”                                            GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (b) Keech ma markue’ kue ’n-oolehl.
            “My plants got eaten.”                                            FS 1980 (PP)
        (c) Yo’ keech ma tohpekwtom’.
            “He has made a hole.”                                             FS 1980 (PP)    The rarest combination is keech kee, which means “now (somebody) can (do some-
thing)”; the “can” part of the meaning comes from kee and the “now” part from keech. An
example is in (108).
(108)   Keech kee ’na-’ahspee’moh.
        “Now we can drink.”                                                       YL 1951
Chapter 8Using other preverbs8.1 Using cho’ in exhortations
The preverb cho’ is mostly used with a second-person verb in commands directed by
the speaker to the addressee. For this reason, an English imperative is usually a good
translation. Singular non-bipersonal examples are in (109).
(109) Examples of cho’ in commands: Singular subjects

 10.3.2         Color terms
 Languages differ in the variety of terms used in referring to colors, and in the aspect of
 color they express (for example, hue vs. brightness). In many languages, while there are
 many terms for speciﬁc hues, only a few color terms are generally used. The traditional
 use of color terms in Yurok and other languages of northwestern California was probably
 of this type. Probably a few color terms were used to refer to general hues as well as
 brightness or saturation, with other color terms used to refer to speciﬁc hues.
     Yurok color terms can be divided into the three categories in (198). (198)     (a) classificatory color terms: Table 10.3 above
           (b) two-form color terms: Table 10.4 (page 109)
           (c) invariant color terms: (201–202) below     The colors in Table 10.3 have a relatively rich classiﬁcatory structure, with many
 forms.¹ These were likely the most common color terms in Classical Yurok usage; the
 “light” and “dark” terms probably had a broader range of uses than English white and
 black. For example, they might have been used for hues with light or dark brightness
 or saturation that could be described as (light) green or (dark) brown in English usage.
 Some of the color terms in Table 10.3 are exempliﬁed in (199–200).","[138, 139]"
"          Table 10.1: Selected numerals from 1 to 10 (q = question “How many?”)
10.3           Numerals and color terms
Words used for counting things (“one”, “two”, etc.) and words used to describe colors
(“light-colored”, “red”, etc.) are mostly verbs in Yurok. (Recall that Yurok, unlike English,
does not have any adjectives.) The most commonly-used forms are attributive verbs
and non-inflected verbs.
     A distinctive feature of Yurok numerals and color terms is that they change form
depending on the meaning of what they are applied to; a different form of “two” or “light-
colored” is used for snakes and for human beings. This is a classificatory system; it
is how Yurok organizes phenomena in the world. Numerals show more different forms
than color terms in Yurok, but both are classiﬁcatory.",[137]

    key “sit” (p. 261)                        ’oyhlkesek’ “I lie down” (p. 266)

    ’ooleenek’ “I lie down” (p. 264)For human beings and animals, there are six main verbs of posture: three that refer to
being (continuing to be) in a position, and three that refer to change of position. They
fall into three groups — standing, sitting, lying — with the following usage patterns:           change of position                        position in a location  sit      chyuuek’wenek’ (∼ chyuuk’w ∼ rek’eeen)    animate key (∼ keychek’eenek’)

  lie      ’ooleenek’                                ’oyhlkesek’ (∼ ’oyhl)Verbs in the change of position column are used when the subject assumes the po-
sition (for example, standing up from a sitting position) or moves to a new position.
Verbs in the position in a location column are used as background or to identify the
location of the subject — for example, answering the question “Where is it?”
    In two of the categories above, Yurok distinguishes between two verbs for position
in a location. For example, key refers to animates (people, animals, birds) sitting,
and tek refers to inanimates (such as rocks and plants) sitting. And ’oolo’ refers to an-
imates standing, while tepon’ refers to inanimates (usually trees) standing. Note that
inanimates include plants and trees; the “animates” are really things that are not ﬁxed
in location.

10.3.1         Numerals
A few of the most common sets of numerals (from 1 to 10 only) are shown in Table
10.1 above and Table 10.2 on page 107. As the tables illustrate, the structure of Yurok
numerals is as follows. Each numeral from 1 to 4 is a single word, changing its form
according to the type of thing being counted. Above 5, the numerals consist of two (or
more) words: the ﬁrst word is usually an invariant form, like kohchew “six”, and the
second word changes its form depending on what is being counting. The last line in
each table shows the form used in questions: to ask “How many are there?” you need to
know what kind of thing you are asking about.
    Included in Tables 10.1–10.2 are the numerals for various classes: people; animals;
round things and money (since coins are round); numbers of times (“once”, “twice”, etc.);
things shaped like sticks; ﬂat things; and sacks and bundles. Yurok has other sets of
numerals as well: for things shaped like ropes or snakes, for plants and bushy things,

 Chapter 1 The sounds of Yurok 1.1 Writing and pronunciation
 The principle of the basic sound, which linguists call the phoneme, underlies the writing
 of a language and its sound patterns. In every language, sounds can be arranged into a
 set of phonemes or basic sounds. Sometimes a phoneme is pronounced in only one
 way in a language; or a single phoneme may have two or more different pronunciations
 depending on its position in the word, or on nearby sounds.¹ In what follows, the writing
 system to be described is phonemic in the sense that each basic Yurok sound has a
 unique spelling (which may consist of more than one letter, such as ch, er, or eee).","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"

Chapter 22Verbs of perception and

    chperwerkseemek’ “I remember him”            neee’nek’ “I look at it” (p. 250)
      (p. 241)                                   neee’nowok’ “I watch it” (p. 251)
    hesek’ “I think” (p. 243)                    nekomuykook’ “I know how” (p. 254)
    hlkyorkwek’ “I watch it” (p. 245)            newook’ “I see it” (p. 255)
    komchuemek’ “I know it” (p. 248)             soosek’ “I think (so)” (p. 258)The most general verbs of thinking are hesek’ “I think” and soosek’ “I think (so)”, which
differ in that hesek’ highlights the content of a thought and soosek’ highlights the type
of thought. The four main perception verbs above can be classiﬁed as shown in the fol-
lowing table:                           source-oriented            experiencer-oriented               hearing     ko’moyok’    “I hear it”   chpa’royok’   “I listen”
               sight       newook’      “I see it”    neee’nek’     “I look at it”In each modality — hearing and sight — there is a source-oriented verb as well as an
experiencer-oriented verb. The source-oriented verb highlights the source of the sound
or sight; you do not usually choose whether to hear or see something. The experiencer-
oriented verb highlights the activity of the subject, who can try to listen or look at some-
thing of interest. The English translations also convey the same meaning.

in (341).
(341)     Noohl ’o chpega’roy’ kue ’ne-psech ho kue meweemor.
          “Then my father asked (lit. to) the old man.”                              FS 1951 (YL)
Verbs with similar meanings
The verb ko’moyok’ “I hear it” (page 246) differs in that chpa’royok’ is experiencer-oriented
while ko’moyok’ is source-oriented (see page 239).","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271]"

Grammatical description: transitive oo-class verb (3 sg -om’)Meaning and usage
This verb means “treat (it) in a speciﬁed way”, for example “well” (skuy’) or “badly” (keem’).
Sentences with sonkook’ usually express both the object that is treated in some way, and
the way in which it is treated. For example, in (218), kue ’yoch “the boat” is the object and
the question word kues “how?” expresses the manner. The passive, illustrated in (219),
is the most common form.
(218)     Kues ’elekw sonkohl kue ’yoch?
          “What on earth did they do with (lit. how did they treat) the boat?”                 YL 1951(219)     (a) Wee’eeet hewonee sonkee’.

 like. These convey exhortation or urging but do not require a command directed at the
 addressee.¹
¹ Linguists might refer to the construction in (109–113) as hortative or even optative, and might call cho’
  a modal preverb. This would explain why cho’ is used in the longer words heep’encho’ and muehlcho’, which
  mean “maybe”, as well as mocho’ “if”; they share meanings of possibility or future-oriented uncertainty.

    In addition to its very common use in (109–113), cho’ is found in more specialized

soo, son’, etc. to ask how something is.","[109, 110]"

in (308a) means “he put it on the plate”, and pa’aahl nekue’ in (308b) means “it was put
in the water”.
     Two special combinations are shown in (309–310). The combination kes nekek’ “I

Verbs with similar meanings
The most common verb whose meaning is close to nekek’ is the verb lootek’ “I throw it,
I toss it, I put it (somewhere) loosely’ (page 212). The basic difference between these
two verbs is that nekek’ implies relatively precise placement, as when you are holding
something until it is ﬁnally in place, while lootek’ implies loss of contact and less preci-
sion in the location expressed. Another verb with a similar meaning is leketek’ “I pick it
up, I put it somewhere’, but this verb does not require a location to be expressed.","[247, 248]"

"  5.1 Overview
  Many details of verb formation are in chapters 5–6. First, an overview of some of the
  most important categories of inﬂected verbs may be useful. The speciﬁc categories iden-
  tiﬁed pertain to mood, a linguistic term which refers broadly to the type of sentence or
  clause that a verb appears in. Yurok inﬂected verbs have four different moods, as follows:
• indicative (discussed in this chapter): used in most simple statements and questions
• imperative (discussed in this chapter): used in direct commands
• subjunctive (§6.4): typically used when one verb is dependent on another verb
• attributive (§6.5): used in phrases that modify or stand in for nouns
38      /      Basic verb formation
    The four moods have somewhat different endings, and are used in different ways.
Given in (37) are forms of hegook’ “I walk, I go”: an indicative, an imperative, a subjunc-
tive, and an attributive.(37)    (a) indicative: Nek keetee hegook’ so Rek’woy.
            “I am going to go to Requa.”                                                         YL 1951
        (b) imperative: Hego’och so kue muenchey nahko’!
            “Go to the white board!”                                                  GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (c) subjunctive: Nek weet soneenepek’ kee ’n-egook’.
            “I think I will go.”                                                          FS 1980 (PP)

5.2     Non-inﬂected verbs
Non-inﬂected verbs (abbreviated vn in the dictionary) have no endings. They are shorter
— sometimes a lot shorter — than their inﬂected counterparts; often they are used in
very common expressions. Table 5.1 lists some common non-inﬂected verbs, together
with their inﬂected counterparts.        non-inflected verbs                inflected counterparts        chahchew “it’s diﬃcult”

5.3.1 Singular e-class verbs
Table 5.2 shows how e-class verbs work for singular subjects, that is, where one person
does the verbal action; either I do it (1 sg); you (one person) do it (2 sg); or he, she, or

hegolek’ (page 146) has several irregular forms, including hem’ “he, she says, tells” and
the imperatives hach’es and heks’es “tell him, her!”","[68, 69, 70, 71]"

any starting or ending point; in the second example, the implication is that the speaker
started singing.

              “It was hard for her to take care of her grandson.”                FS 1951 (YL)  Each sentence in (81) uses ho because these ﬁrst few sentences are setting the back-
  ground for the story; ho is ordinarily used for information about what was happening
  prior to, or in the background of, the events of a story. After the third sentence, the
  narration shifts to the series of events and ho is not used.
      A ﬁnal speciﬁc situation where only ho is used is together with iterative verbs (§6.6),
  in the meaning “used to”, as in (82). Each iterative verb in (82) has an inserted -eg-.","[98, 99]"
" 6.1.2 Using passives
 The term basic subject may be useful to avoid ambiguity in referring to the subject of
 a non-passive verb.² For example, the basic subject of newook’ “I see it” and newoyek’ “I¹ Note that passive forms like hohkelek’ need not have the unlikely meaning “somebody made or repaired me”
  (as if spoken by a boat or house); they could be used in a causative construction with meanings like “somebody
  made me (do something)”. For this construction see §12.2 on page 121.
² Linguists might use the term underlying subject.

used when the basic subject is unknown or of no special interest in context.(50)     (a)   Keech ho’omohtkoyek’.

ipant who is affected by the action. This is especially common for plural basic subjects
that might be translated as “they” or “people” (in general).(51)     (a)   Hesem’ hes newoyem’?
               “Do you think they see you?”

52      /      Additional verb types
   As illustrated in (52), passives are also sometimes used when the basic subject is
overtly expressed — kue puesee “that cat” in (52a) and kue meges “the doctor” in (52b).
Typically, in such cases the focus of attention is not the basic subject but the participant
who is affected by the action.

While the verbs discussed above have endings that indicate the subject, Yurok also has
verbs with endings that indicate both the subject and the object. These are called biper-
sonal verbs, and can be used when the object of the verb refers to a person (or an animal
behaving like a person, for example in a story). Examples are in (53–54). The verbs in
(53) all end in -chek’ and involve a subject “I” and an object “you”, such as ko’moyochek’
“I hear you” in (53a).
(53)    (a) Nek ko’moyochek’.
            “I heard you.”                                                      AF 2001 (JB)

laayoluepa’ “you teach me”.

            “Wait for me until the day after tomorrow.”                             YL 1951Generally, if a verb’s object is a person — “me, you, her, him, us, them” — then a biper-
sonal form is usually used. Some speakers use them regularly only in examples like
(53–54) where “I” and “you” are involved, especially in Modern Yurok, but most speak-
ers use a broad range of bipersonal forms as appropriate. Full bipersonal paradigms of
numerous individual verbs are given throughout chapters 14–24.","[81, 82, 83]"
"(117) Yurok negative words
      (a) the ordinary negative preverb neemee, or (especially in Classical Yurok) its
          variants mee, ’eemee, and keemee “will not”
      (b) the emphatic negative particle mos (and a rare longer variant mosee’)Note that neemee is a preverb that occurs before the verb together with other preverbs,
while mos is a discourse particle that occurs, like to’, at the beginning of a sentence. In
texts and spontaneous language use by ﬂuent speakers, in the expression of negation
neemee is more common; mos occurs in an important but restricted set of situations.
80      /     Using other preverbs
8.2.1 Ordinary and emphatic negation
The emphatic negative particle mos is used in four main situations.
   First, mos is the usual negative word used to express meanings such as “nobody”,
“nothing”, “not . . . anybody”, and “not anything”. As shown in (118), examples mostly
have mos kol’.

ples of mos cheetaa “not at all” are shown in (119).

        (a) Mos cheetaa wo pahchew.

            “And no notice at all was taken of him.”                         FS 1951 (YL)Sometimes the ﬁrst two patterns are combined, with mos cheetaa kol’, as in (120).
(120)   Examples of mos cheetaa kol’
        (a) Mos cheetaa kol’ ’osreer.
            “There isn’t a sound anywhere.”                                   FS 1980 (PP)
        (b) Mos cheetaa kol’ sook kee nee ’oyhl.
            “Nothing at all lay on it.”                                      FS 1951 (YL)
        (c) Mos cheetaa koleen chweenkep’.
            “Neither (of them) spoke at all.”                                FS 1951 (YL)    A third context for mos is when the intended meaning has a generalizing sense like
“could not”, “would not”, “shall not”, or “never”, as in (121).
(121)   Generalizing mos
        (a) Mos weet kee skuyen’ kee k’e-’wegahpemew.
            “It would not be good for you to get married.”                   BF 1951 (YL)
        (b) Mos wey ’ue-kertkerk’.
            “He was never done ﬁshing for trout.”                            FS 1951 (YL)
                                                        Using other preverbs        /      81
   Finally, in (122), examples are given of a fourth context for mos. For instance, the
emphasis in (122a) is clear from the emphatic pronoun kelee’: “this is absolutely not
your ﬁshing place!” The example in (122b) implies the meaning “any”. In general, when
the intended negative expresses or implies meanings such as “not at all” or “not any”,
then the emphatic negative particle mos is used.
(122) Emphatic mos
      (a) Mos kelee’ k’-ekwol.
          “It is not your ﬁshing place.”                                          FS 1951 (YL)
      (b) Mos kee nahcheechek’ .
          “I won’t give you any.”                                               FS 1951 (RHR)    By contrast, the ordinary negative preverb neemee is used in other situations. It is
the default negative marker, and illustrated in (123).
(123) Examples of neemee
      (a) Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’.
          “I don’t feel well.”                                         FS 1980 (PP)
      (b) Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet.
          “It’s not very windy here.”                                  FS 1980 (PP)
      (c) Kue pa’aahl ’we-tmenomen neemee nepue’.
          “The half of the salmon facing the water was not eaten.”     FS 1951 (YL)
      (d) Muehlcho’ neemee soo komchuemehl.
          “Perhaps they do not know.”                                  FS 1951 (YL)
      (e) Neemee hegohkuemehl stowstek’ ’ue-’weskwen neemee mehl hego’omah.
          “They did not pick ﬁr branches and did not make ﬁre with them.”
                                                                                  FS 1951 (YL)   The difference between mos and neemee comes out sometimes in the difference be-
tween mos skuy’ and neemee skuy’. Mos skuy’ means “not at all well” — implying “quite
badly”; examples are in (124).
(124) Examples of mos skuy’
      (a) Mos skuy’ kee k’e-teloyewek’.
          “It’s not (at all) good for you to lie.”                                FS 1980 (PP)
      (b) Mos nuemee skuy’ soo chwegeen kue wenchokws.
          “I really don’t like to talk to that woman.”                            JJ 2007 (LC)
      (c) Mos skuy’ soo chkeyek’ nahschueh.
          “I didn’t sleep well last night.”                                       JJ 2007 (LC)By contrast, as in (125), neemee skuy’ just means “not well”.
(125) Examples of neemee skuy’
      (a) Neemee skuy’ soo newee’.
          “It doesn’t look good.”                                              GT 2003 (YLCB)
      (b) Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’.
          “I don’t feel well.”                                                    FS 1980 (PP)In (125a), for example, it is more polite to say something doesn’t look good than to say
that it looks bad (“not at all good”). Or compare “slept badly” in (124c) vs. “don’t feel
well” in (125b).
 82        /       Using other preverbs
 8.2.2 Negation and time reference
 8.2.2.1       Negation and past time
 A special past-time preverb wo is used in negative contexts. This is the most common
 way of expressing past time negation. The examples in (126) illustrate wo in sentences
 negated with neemee.
 (126)     Examples of neemee wo
           (a) Kwesee’ neemee nuemee wo chpaa nohl helomey’.
               “Coyote did not dance for a very long time.”                    MM 1927 (YT)
           (b) Neemee wo hlee’.
               “It was not accepted.”                                            BF 1951 (YL)
           (c) Neemee wo weykee’.
               “It was not ﬁnished.”                                                 YL 1951
           (d) Neemee heenoy wo hoole’moh.
               “We did not follow you.”                                              YL 1951
           (e) Neemee wo nahchelek’ kee ’ne-hlkyorkwek’.
               “I wasn’t allowed to watch.”                                      FS 1980 (PP)
           (f) Neemee wo skeweenepek’.
               “I didn’t eat enough.”                                            FS 1980 (PP)     In (126), all that is expressed is that something did not happen. By contrast, in (127),
 wo occurs in sentences negated with mos. In these examples, either mos cheetaa suggests
 the emphatic reading “none at all”, or a verb like ko’moyok’ suggests an interpretation like
 “they could not hear (anything)”.
 (127)     Examples of mos wo
           (a) Kwesee mos cheetaa wo neee’nowee’ kue wee ’o key.
               “No notice whatever was taken of him where he sat.”               FS 1951 (YL)
           (b) Mos cheetaa wo pahchew.
               “It did not move at all.”                                         FS 1951 (YL)
           (c) Mos wo ko’moyohl.
               “They did not hear.”                                                  YL 1951
 8.2.2.2       Negation and future time
 To express future negation, two patterns are common; the modal future preverb kee is
 used with mos or neemee.¹ Typically, as in (128), neemee kee means “will not (won’t)”.
 (128)     Examples of neemee kee “will not”
           (a) Neemee kee kooych.
               “I will not buy it.”                                                  YL 1951
           (b) Neemee kee skuy’ soo hoole’mow’.
               “You will not get on well.”                                       FS 1951 (YL) As shown in (129), mos kee means “cannot (can’t)”.","[110, 111, 112, 113]"

Chapter 14Verbs of communicationThe following verbs are described in this chapter:    chweenkepek’ “I talk” (p. 142)             saa’agochek’ “I speak Yurok” (p. 149)
    ’erperk’ “I tell” (p. 144)                 sochpeyewek’ “I say it” (p. 150)
    hegolek’ “I say” (p. 146)                  tegeruemek’ “I talk to her or him” (p. 152)
    hegoosek’ “I shout” (p. 148)               ’werrgeryercherk’ “I speak English” (p. 154)Three of these eight verbs — hegoosek’ “I shout”, saa’agochek’ “I speak Yurok”, ’werrgery-
ercherk’ “I speak English” — have specialized meanings that are easy to learn, but others
may be harder. These ﬁve verbs have the general meaning “say, speak, talk”: chweenkepek’,
’erperk’, hegolek’, sochpeyewek’, and tegeruemek’; but their precise usage is quite distinct.

Special symbols† A dagger or obelisk marks phrases or sentences that are unacceptable to ﬂuent speak-
     ers of a language; you cannot say them. For example, in English †Man the is old is
     impossible. Similarly, in Yurok, because a preverb like ’ochkaa must precede the
     verb, you cannot say †Kepoyuerek’ ’ochkaa.
* An asterisk marks Yurok expressions that are almost certainly possible, but that do
     not happen to be documented in recordings of speakers.
AcknowledgementsWe would not know what we know about Yurok without the patient work of ﬂuent
speakers who never stopped teaching their language. I had the good fortune to learn
from ’aawokw Aileen Figueroa, Jimmie James, Glenn Moore, Sr., Archie Thompson, and
Georgiana Trull. I have also spent many hours listening to, and reading transcripts of,
the voices of other Yurok speakers, including the elders of a century and longer ago;
those of the mid-twentieth century, such as Lowana Brantner, Frank Douglas, Florence
Shaughnessy, Alice Spott, and Robert Spott; and many others. All of them generously
shared their knowledge so their language can endure with its people.
    Also essential have been linguists of earlier generations who worked with ﬂuent
speakers to document Yurok, carefully studied aspects of its grammar, and published
valuable analyses of its patterns. The most important of these linguists is R. H. Robins,
whose book The Yurok language (1958) contains key observations on every page; this
book makes constant use of what he learned from Florence Shaughnessy and other
Yurok elders. Also invaluable is the work of Howard Berman, A. L. Kroeber, Paul Proulx,
Edward Sapir, and T. T. Waterman. These scholars created a lasting analytic framework
for the study of Yurok grammar.
    This book is intended for members of the Yurok community — language learners and
teachers — and is a direct result of their support and inspiration. Participants in the Yurok
Language Institute and grammar workshops have made helpful comments and sugges-
tions on grammar, handouts, and drafts of part of this book; they include Tammy Cairns,
Leo Canez, Georgiana Gensaw, Robert R. Kinney, Kate Lowry, Skip Lowry, Chelsea
Reed, Margo Robbins, Bessie Shorty, Britty Vigil, Lawrence Williams, and others. The
Yurok Tribe language program staff over the years — Victoria Carlson, James Gensaw,
Barbara McQuillen, Kathleen Vigil, and their colleagues and interns — are good friends
and engaging teachers. Long-time Yurok language teacher Kay Inong has played an im-
portant role in creating a language curriculum that informs the choice of topics covered
in this book. The Yurok Tribe language program poy ’we-son, Carole Lewis, deserves spe-
cial mention for her hard work and long-term vision in creating a program that inspires
communities throughout California. Thanks also to activist, artist, and Yurok language
teacher Annelia Hillman for kindly contributing original artwork to this book.
    Without two friends who changed my career, I would never have worked with the
Yurok language. Leanne Hinton introduced me to California language documentation
and revitalization, and has offered unstinting support. Juliette Blevins introduced me to
Yurok itself, persuaded me that a philologist could play a role in the community, and
talked with me for years about the grammar of the language. I am forever grateful to
xxii     /     Acknowledgements

    My colleagues Lisa Conathan, James Martin, Line Mikkelsen, Alysoun Quinby, Ruth
Rouvier, Justin Spence, and Tess Wood have greatly improved my understanding of
Yurok grammar with ideas and work that have made a difference throughout this book.

PrefaceThis book is meant to be used by Yurok language teachers and advanced learners, in
support of language restoration in the Yurok community. That goal has determined the
contents and style of what follows. Linguists and other scholars may ﬁnd this useful
as well, but should be aware that it is not an academic reference grammar. All readers
should keep in mind that languages are best learned by speaking and listening; this is a
supplement to the spoken language.
    This is a combination, expansion, and revision of two earlier publications, Yurok verb
guide: 75 common verbs (2009, 78 pages) and Basic Yurok grammar (2010, 69 pages).
Those earlier books are completely superseded by this one; substantial content has been
added and signiﬁcant errors have been corrected.
    Part I (chapters 1–10) provides information about the sounds of Yurok and about
basic grammatical and vocabulary patterns. Many were identiﬁed by the Yurok Tribe
for teacher certiﬁcation purposes. Part II (chapters 11–25) introduces the meanings and
forms of the most common Yurok verbs. Over 200 different verbs are covered, in 117
numbered sections. Because Yurok verbs tend to pack more information into them than
English verbs, Yurok verbs usually have many different forms, indicating participants
in the action and sometimes also relations to other verbs in the sentence. Some Yurok
verbs have dozens of different forms. This makes a guide useful.
    Other grammatical topics are discussed only brieﬂy (such as some of the preverbs),
or are omitted entirely (such as reﬂexive and reciprocal verbs, locative forms of nouns,
and many sentence patterns). Advanced learners and teachers may consult R. H. Robins’s
1958 book The Yurok language: Grammar, texts, lexicon, written in a technical style for
linguists, and other linguistic publications. See the Bibliography on pages 299–300 for
details.","[27, 28, 29, 30]"
"1.2.2 Glottalized stops
Unlike English, Yurok has glottalized stops: p’, t’, ch’, k’, and k’w. They are sometimes
hard to hear, especially at the end of a word, but they can be very important. For example,
ﬁrst-person singular verb forms (meaning “I” did it) usually end in -k’, and for many
verbs glottalization also expresses the third-person singular. Examples are in Table 1.4.               plain stops                      glottalized stops               Chuelue nee nep “wild parsley”   nep’ “s/he eats”

 1.2.3 Long vowels
 The term long vowel refers to a vowel sound that lasts twice as long as an ordinary
 vowel. English has no long vowel phonemes (vowels that are always twice as long as
 other vowels). The Yurok long vowels aa, oo, err, eee, and uue correspond to the short
 vowels a, o, er, ee, and ue. Make sure to draw them out; they should last fully twice as
 long as short vowels, and about as long as a short vowel plus h. Some very common
 words with long vowels are listed in (13).¹
 (13)      Common words with long vowels
           (a) Long aa: chmeyaan “yesterday”, ha’aag “rock”, ’ochkaa (preverb), paa’ “no”,
               wehlowaa “ten”
           (b) Long oo: hlook’ “I take”, noohl “then”, ’oohl “person”, ’ook’ “I am”, roo “time”,
               sootook’ “I go”
           (c) Long err: ’er’gerrch “sweathouse”, serrhlerperk’ “I do”, ’errwerh “grass”, k’err’
               “crow”
           (d) Long eee: cheeek “money”, neee’nowok’ “I watch it”, rek’eeen “sit” (collective),
               we’eeet “this”
           (e) Long uue: chyuue’ “good-bye”, chyuuekwenek’ “I sit”, huuek(soh) “child(ren)”,
               nuuem’ “arrive” (collective)
 The examples in Table 1.5 contrast the corresponding short and long vowels in words
 that are generally similar.                  short vowel                          long vowel                   a    hak’ws “s/he laughs”           aa      chaahl “sand”
                        ma (past time preverb)                 chpegaa “cormorant”
                   o    so “toward”                    oo      soo “thus”
                        komchuemek’ “I know it”                myootek’ “I put it on”
                  er    ’wer’errgerch                  err     kerrcherh “mountain ridge”
                        ’ne-merm “my son”                      kerrmeek’ “nine”
                  ee    kohchee “once”                 eee     spegeee “hawk”
                        ch’eeshah “dog”                        cheeeshep’ “ﬂower”
                        heekon “formerly”                      reeek’ew “shore”
                  ue    kuechos “grandmother”          uue     muueweemor “old men”
                        muenchey “white”                       puuenomaap’ “dogwood”
                        wohpuek “into the water”               puuek “deer”                                Table 1.5: Short and long vowel pairs 1.2.4 The vowels a and o
 Unlike many varieties of US English, Yurok distinguishes between two vowels a and
 o, or long aa and oo. Whereas the vowels of cot and caught are often confused or pro-
 nounced the same (in California English), in Yurok the vowels of words like pa’ah “water”¹ The rare long vowel uur is omitted. The other ﬁve long vowels are included in (13) and Table 1.5.
  14      /      The sounds of Yurok
  and po’oh “scar” are never confused. Note also that Yurok o is rounder than the vowel in
  caught: it is not precisely the same as any American English vowel.","[43, 44, 45]"
"(116) Examples of cho’ expressing temporal relation
      (a) Keet hego’omah cho’ nuue’mehl yo’hlkoh.
          “We were starting to make ﬁres (when) they arrived.”                           YL 1951
      (b) Kue cho plegohpeen kee yegook’.
          “When the water is high I will go.”                                            YL 1951
      (c) Kue yo’ keetee cho sootoleen nek kee megelook’.

English negative sentences usually have not or -n’t. Yurok negative sentences are usually
formed with the words in (117).",[110]
"
 3.4 Short forms
 Many Yurok nouns have short, one-syllable alternative forms that are used in certain
 contexts. Short forms are listed in the Yurok dictionary (online and in print) whenever¹ In Classical Yurok, the term ’ne-mey’ was apparently used only for unmarried daughters. With changes in
  family structure, it is now also used for married daughters and the term ’ne-’moo has fallen out of use.

 they are known, but it is easy to invent new ones, since the patterns by which they are
 derived so straightforward.¹
     In words that have a short vowel in the ﬁrst syllable, the short form usually consists
 of the word-initial consonant (or consonant group), the short vowel, and the immedi-
 ately following consonant. This ﬁrst pattern is illustrated in Table 3.9.                                  long form                         short form                                  chahkwoh         “pants”          chah

 are commonly shortened when used in possessed phrases.

 phrases that are derived from longer nouns, especially ﬁxed possessive phrases (like
 ’oohl ’ue-pop, literally “Indian’s bread”), familiar nouns are often shortened.
     The examples in Tables 3.9–3.10 and (19) all involve short-vowel nouns. In words
 that have a long vowel in the ﬁrst syllable, the short form usually consists of the word-
 initial consonant (or consonant group) and the long vowel (but not any following con-
 sonant). This second pattern is illustrated in Table 3.11 on page 30.","[58, 59, 60]"
"  1.1.3.2 The phoneme w
  The phoneme w has two pronunciation variants:
• The most common Modern Yurok variant is identical to English w.
• A common Classical Yurok variant is a slightly stronger articulation with air passing
  between the tongue and the roof of the mouth and with the lips rounded. This is a com-
  bination of w and the weak variant of g.
  If you listen carefully to recordings of words like newook’ “I see it”, you will hear both
  pronunciations.³ ¹ Technically, this is a velar fricative [G].
 ² Technically, this is a velar glide [î].
 ³ Technically, the second variant is a labialized velar fricative [Gw ]). It was often written gw by anthropologists
   and other non-Yurok people in the early twentieth century. Yurok does not have a “gw” combination.

                        Figure 1.1: Yurok language camp at ’Ohpoh, 20141.1.3.3    The phoneme e
The phoneme e has three pronunciation variants. First, if e is stressed in the last syllable
of a word (or the only syllable of a one-syllable word), the open pronunciation is used.
Open e is intermediate between the vowels in English head and had. Open e is found in
the ﬁnal syllable of the words in (1).
(1)       Open e
          (a) One-syllable words: chekws “heart”, mech “ﬁre”, ’yekwhl “maggot”
          (b) Two-syllable words with open e before w or y: Chuerey “Trinidad”, Hop’ew
              “Klamath”, perey “old woman”
          (c) Other two-syllable words: chewes “hand”, keekwten “moss”, keeshen “sum-
              mer”, pontet “ashes”
Open e is sometimes spelled “a” by users of the Yurok Alphabet, but it is not the same
as the vowel in English had; nor does it have the same quality as the a vowels in Yurok
ma (past time preverb), ch’eeshah “dog”, or chaahl “beach”.
    Second, if e is stressed in the ﬁrst syllable of a word with more than one syllable,
the tense pronunciation is used (but not before r). Tense e is intermediate between lax
e and the vowel sound of English hate and bait; for some but not all Yurok speakers it
may be identical to that English sound. In each word in (2), the ﬁrst vowel is a tense e
and the second e is either open (if it is in the ﬁnal syllable) or lax.
                                                           The sounds of Yurok     /      9
(2)     Tense e
        (a) Repetitive verbs: slekwslekw “put clothes on”, tekwtekwsook’ “I cut it up”,
             tektekon’ “it’s sticky”
        (b) Nouns and non-inﬂected verbs: chekwchem “black acorns”, keget “mountain
             lion”, keychek “tired”, kweget “visit”, legech “mudhen”, segep “coyote”
Tense e is spelled “ey” in the Yurok Alphabet, but is not the same sound as the combi-
nation of e plus y. That combination occurs in words like cheykenee “small”, and is also
spelled “ey” in the Yurok Alphabet.
    Third, in all other contexts (wherever open and tense e are not used), the lax pro-
nunciation is used. Lax e is the same as the vowel sound of English head.
    Open and tense e only occur in stressed syllables and only in adverbs, interjections,
nouns, pronouns, and verbs — not in the various particle word classes (see §2.6). Oth-
erwise, there are very few exceptions to the rules above; one common exception is hesek’,
whose ﬁrst syllable has a lax vowel rather than the tense vowel.
    The relationships among the variant pronunciations of e can clearly be seen when
the same vowel, in a related word, undergoes a change because its word position has
changed. Several such examples are in (3–6). In each case, the ﬁrst word has a tense e
that becomes open e in the related second word. For example, in each verb pair in (3),
the ﬁrst form is a 1 sg verb with tense e in the initial syllable and the second form is the
corresponding 3 sg verb with an open e.
(3)     Tense e → Open e: Verb pairs
        (a) chkeyek’ “I sleep” → chkey’ “s/he sleeps”
        (b) nekek’ “I put it” → nek’ “s/he puts it”
        (c) nepek’ “I eat” → nep’ “s/he eats”
In each noun pair in (4), the ﬁrst form is a full noun with tense e in the initial syllable
and the second form is the corresponding short form with an open e (on short forms see
§3.4 beginning on page 27).
(4)     Tense e → Open e: Noun pairs
        (a) lewet “net” → ’ne-lew “my net”
        (b) ’leptoyhl “hair” → ’ne-’lep “my hair”
        (c) pekcheech “rope” → ’ue-pek “his or her rope”
        (d) ’ne-k’ep’ch’em → ’ne-k’ep’ “my daughter-in-law”
In each word pair in (5), the ﬁrst word is a longer noun or verb with tense e in the
initial syllable and the second form is an iterative with an open e (on iteratives see §6.6
beginning on page 59).
(5)     Tense e → Open e: Iteratives
        (a) meskwoh “medicine” → meges “doctor”
        (b) sepolah “prairie” → segep “coyote” (“goes on the prairies”)
        (c) tetolo’hl → teget “cry”
Finally, in the miscellaneous related word pairs in (6), the ﬁrst example in each case has
tense e in an initial syllable and the second example has open e in a ﬁnal syllable.

           (a) pechue → heepech “upriver”
           (b) lekwsee → lekws “outside”
 Compare also the suﬃx -etew- “hand, ﬁnger”, whose second vowel is open e in pletew
 “thumb” and sketew “little ﬁnger”, but lax e in the longer words in (7).

 1.1.3.4       Preﬁx and suﬃx er and err
 Preﬁxes and suﬃxes added to words with the vowels er and err tend to be inﬂuenced
 by those vowels. The affected preﬁxes include possessive ’ne- “my’, our’, k’e- “your”, and
 ’we- “his, her, its, their” (discussed in §3.2); the affected suﬃxes include endings like 1st
 person -ek’, 2nd person -om’, etc.
     When a preﬁx or suﬃx containing a, o, or e is added to a word that has er or err in it,
 then a, o, or e tend to change to er; the long vowels aa and oo likewise tend to change to
 long err. (Usually this does not have any effect on ee or ue.) Examples are given in (8)
 for the preﬁxes ’ne- and ’ke-, and in (9) for the suﬃxes -ek’ and -oom’.
 (8)       The change to er in preﬁxes
           (a) Keech pegerk kue ’ner-merm.

 and less likely in slower speech or when a speaker is pronouncing words carefully.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"

Grammatical description: intransitive oo-class verb (3 sg -ok’w)Meaning and usage
This verb conveys the sense “disappear” or “vanish”, not simply “go away”. It can refer to
people or to anything else that can move and vanish:

attributive form menechoh) refers to “the west”, where the sun sets.","[257, 258]"
"9.1.1 Preverbs and adverbs
One obvious pattern is that preverbs come before the verb; this is why they are called
pre-verbs. For example, in (149), with preverbs in boldface and verbs underlined:
(149) Preverb position
      (a) Keech ho nep’ puuek.
           “He’s been eating deer.”                                          MM 1927 (ES)

before or after verbs. For example, in (150), the adverbs chmeyaan “yesterday”, ’owook
“tomorrow”, and wonekw “above” occupy a position before the verb (and before the pre-
verbs) in two sentences, and after the verb in two others.

 90        /       Sentence patterns
 9.1.2 Nouns and verbs
 It is uncommon for a sentence in ordinary usage to have more than one noun, and it is
 common for sentences to have no nouns. If there is a noun, it may be positioned either
 before or after its verb. As a rule, no more than one noun will be positioned before the
 verb. Any others will be positioned after the verb, and it is even possible that all nouns
 will be positioned after the verb.
      If one noun at most is positioned before the verb, which noun is it? When are nouns
 positioned before their verbs? Two general rules about noun position are given in (151).¹
 (151)     Noun position: Two general rules
           (a) A noun is usually before the verb if it is contrastive, emphasized, or new
               to the discourse.
           (b) A noun is usually after the verb if it conveys old information, or if it is
               very long.
 The rule in (151a) is illustrated in (152), consecutive sentences from a single story.
 These sentences have a series of three contrasting subjects: (a) everyone, (b) kue lochom’
 “the toad”, and (c) kue negeneech “the mouse”.
 (152)     (a) ’Eekee toom’ nue hlkeeegor.
               “Everyone went to watch.”
           (b) Kwesee kue lochom’ ’o ges’, Nek kem kue hlkyorkwek’.
               “And the toad thought, “I too will go watch.”
           (c) Kue negeneech tue’ kem wee’ ’o gegok’w.
               “The mouse too was staying there.”                                                  FS 1951 (YL) Each of the two contrasting nouns is positioned before its verb; the verbs are underlined
 and the preverbal nouns are in boldface.²
     The rule in (151b) is illustrated in (153), a set of sentences that come later in the
 story quoted in (152). When the toad and mouse are mentioned again they are already
 known, so the position of the noun is after the verb.
 (153)     (a) Kwesee yem’ kue negeneech . . .
               “Then the mouse said . . .”
           (b) Kwesee ’o te’noy’ kue lochom’ . . .
               “And the toad was annoyed . . .”
           (c) Kwesee wee’ neenee noo’s kue negeneech.
               “And the mouse giggled around.”                                                     FS 1951 (YL) In each case the (boldface) noun follows rather than preceding the (underlined) verb.","[120, 121]"

¹ Linguists use the term deixis as a cover term for such meaning distinctions. Deixis plays an important role
  in choices between different articles or pronouns.
² In addition, in Classical Yurok, what are called comitative forms in R. H. Robins’s book The Yurok language
  (1958; for the full reference see the Bibliography on page 299) were used: neka’ahl “to me”, nekaanohl “to us”,
  and kela’ahl “to you”. These forms have not yet been documented in Modern Yurok.

            “Walk behind me.”                                                FS 1951 (RHR)    The contrastive singular pronouns nekee’ “I, me” and kelee’ “you” are not used very of-
ten, but they are appropriate when the speaker wishes to imply a contrast with someone
else. Examples are in (22–23). In (22), the contrastive pronouns are subjects.
(22)    Contrastive pronouns used as subjects
        (a) Nekee’ nahchesek’.
            “I gave it to her.”                                               AF 2001 (LJC)
        (b) Nekee’ ruerowok’.
            “I am singing.”                                                    LT 1922 (GR)In (23), the contrastive pronouns are not subjects. Some are possessives; for instance,
in (23a), the speaker implies that it is someone else’s ﬁshing place.
(23)    Contrastive pronouns used as non-subjects
        (a) Mos kelee’ k’-ekwol.
            “It is not your ﬁshing place.”                                   FS 1951 (RHR)
        (b) Kelee’ ’ne-tegeruechek’.
            “I’m talking to you.”                                            FS 1951 (RHR)
        (c) Mos nekee’ ’ne-ch’eesh.
            It is not my dog.”                                                      YL 1951
        (d) Kues soo hesem’, Nekee’ ’ne-tektoh?
            “Why do you think, ‘This is my log’?”                            FS 1951 (RHR)   Finally, Table 4.1 includes two objective pronouns nekach and kelach. These are
used when the object of a verb is “me” or “you (sg)” and the verb has a third-person
subject. Given in (24) are two examples with ordinary transitive verbs and the objective
pronoun kelach “you (sg)”.
(24)    Examples of objective kelach “you (sg)”
        (a) To’ hes kelach skewok kue mewasegoh?
            “Do the boys like you?”                                                 YL 1951
        (b) Yo’ kelach ’o noo’rep’.
            “He followed you there.”                                                YL 1951Given in (25) are examples with objective nekach “me” and bipersonal verbs.
(25)    Examples of objective nekach “me”

            “Your friend likes me.”                                                   YL 1951Finally, (26) shows an example with objective nekach as the object of a preverb ho “at,
to”.
(26)    Nekach ho kweryerw’.
        “Someone whistled to me.”                                               FS 1980 (PP)    The singular pronouns nek “I” and kel’ “you (sg)” are not used as the objects of verbs
with third-person subjects. As seen in (27), however, plural pronouns like nekah “we,
us” are used in this context.
(27)    Yo’hlkoh nekah sermeryerwery.
        “They will kill us.”                                                          YL 1951
4.1.2 Demonstrative pronouns
Demonstrative pronouns refer either to animals, things, or places (like English it, that,
this, here, there), or to people other than the speaker or addressee (like English he, she,
they). Yurok has an elaborate system of demonstrative pronouns in comparison with
English; here only the main pronouns that can be used for people will be mentioned.
These are summarized in Table 4.2.                                       singular         plural                           proximal    wo’ or wo’oot    wo’hlkoh
                            neutral    yo’ or yo’oot    yo’hlkoh                      Table 4.2: Selected demonstrative pronounsIn the singular column, wo’ and yo’ are more common short forms of wo’oot and yo’oot,
respectively, but the short and long forms have the same basic meaning.
    The difference between the proximal and neutral forms is as follows. Proximal
forms refer to someone (or something) who is nearby, or relatively close, especially if
contrasted with someone (or something) farther away. Neutral forms refer to someone
(or something) that is absent or farther away, or in contexts when no particular distance
is implied. Because neutral forms are used when no particular distance is implied, they
are far more common; they are used for “he, she, him, her, they, them” in most instances.
    Examples of proximal demonstratives in sentences are in (28).
(28)    Proximal demonstrative examples
        (a) Wo’ tue’ skewok kee k’e-tegerew.
             “He (this person) wants to talk to you.”                           JJ 2007 (LC)
        (b) Mos wo’oot, nek wee’ serrhl.
             “Not him (this person), I did it.”                                 AF 2001 (JB)Examples of neutral demonstratives in sentences are in (29).

Three other common preverbs are worth mentioning here. Two of them, keetkwo and
noo, have time-related meanings; the other, neenee, has a basic spatial meaning.

8.4.1 Using keetkwo and noo
The preverb keetkwo can be translated “still”, or in combination with a negative “(not)
yet”; examples are in (144).
(144) Examples of keetkwo
      (a) Keetkwo nee cheeweyek’.
          “I’m still hungry.”                                                      JVP 2001 (JB)
      (b) Keetkwo mee ’ue hewechek’.
          “I am not well yet.”                                                           YL 1951    The preverb noo expresses continued activity and can be translated as “keep (doing
something)”. In combination with a negative, it can be translated as “stop (doing some-
thing)”; examples are in (145).
(145) Examples of noo
      (a) Tue noo laay’.
          “He kept going along.”                                                 DW 1907 (ALK)
      (b) Kowecho’ noo chkeyem’.
          “Stop sleeping.” (lit. “Don’t keep sleeping.”)                         OB 1927 (ALK)
8.4.2 Using neenee
The preverb neenee has two main uses. First, it is used for actions that move around, or
events that simultaneously take place, in a variety of places; “about” or “around” is often a
good translation. Examples with verbs that are consistent with motion appear in (146).
(146) Examples of neenee “(going) around”
      (a) Wee’ neenee kepoyuerek’.
          “I swim about at random.”                                               MM 1927 (ES)
      (b) Kolo wee’ neenee hak’ws.
          “She was kind of laughing around there.”                                 FS 1951 (YL)With verbs that are inconsistent with motion, as in (147), the meaning of neenee is that
multiple subjects or multiple objects are located in a variety of places.
(147) Examples of neenee “(multiple subjects or objects being) around”
      (a) Wee’ neenee rek’eeen ’ue-kahchuuem’.
          “They’re sitting around sewing.”                               FS 1980 (PP)
      (b) To’ cho’ neenee neee’nowom’.
          “You should look around.”                                    DW 1906 (ALK)   Second, neenee expresses comparison and can be translated “more”, as in (148).
(148) Comparative neenee
      (a) Cho’ neenee plerrsem’.
          “Talk louder.”                                                           FS 1951 (YL)
      (b) Nek neenee chey ’o kel’.
          “I am younger than you.”                                                       YL 1951Note that even though the best translation may involve an English adjective (louder,
younger), Yurok neenee is a preverb.
Chapter 9Sentence patterns9.1 Basic word order
Yurok word order is ﬂexible. It is often possible to arrange the words in the same sen-
tence in two or more different ways, all of them quite acceptable. The order that speakers
choose may depend more on emphasis and the nature of their conversation or story than
on purely syntactic rules. But several clear patterns can be noted here.","[117, 118, 119, 120]"
