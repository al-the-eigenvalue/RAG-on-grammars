12.10.1 Polar interrogative clauses
      Polar questions seek a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. This type of clause is obligatorily
marked by the interrogative clitic =nit.3 The interrogative clitic is in complementary
        3
            Note that the interrogative morpheme is homophonous with the same-subject enclitic =nit ‘S.S’
(Chapter 13) and the plural collective –nit ‘PL.COL’ (Chapter 4). Whether there is a historic relation
between these forms has yet to be explored in future research.

with the same hosts as the declarative marker =na; that is, interrogative =nit can
occur with predicates, as well as with nouns (including pronouns, demonstratives),
and with adjectives. Examples (59)-(62) below illustrate polar interrogative clauses.
Examples (59)-(60) show affirmative polar interrogative clauses. Negative
interrogative clauses are illustrated in (61)-(62):59) Manú           ̃̌

    ‘aren’t you going?’62) ma=beʔên-kan=nit
    2SG=recognize-NEG=INTERR
    ‘don’t you recognize?’       In verbless polar interrogative clauses, the predicate nominal carries the
interrogative clitic =nit:63) jeděʔ-wã  jěb     hɨm=nit          pumʔ=nit=ti
    parakeet-PL 2PL      exist=S.S        group=INTERR=INTS

    3SG.M         crab=INTERR
    ‘is he the crab?’       Common greetings in Kakua are similar to polar questions, but the
interrogative marker =nit is often omitted in these. These greetings do not elicit
information, as they refer to an action for which the speaker has clear direct evidence
and thus doesn’t require an answer. Note that, since the declarative marker can be
omitted in declarative clauses, the type of clauses presented below can alternatively
be analyzed as declarative clauses. The examples below illustrate a morning greeting
(65) and arrival greetings (66)-(67):
330     A Grammar of Kakua65) ma=hâ
    2SG=get.up
    ‘are you up?’66) ma=hɨw ̃̌ ʔ
    2SG=arrive.here
    ‘have you arrived?’67) ma=tɨ ̃̂j
    2SG=be.good
    ‘how are you?’ (lit. you good)        Departure greetings do require the interrogative clitic. Example (68)
illustrates the typical greeting directed towards those who are leaving. Again, it does
not elicit information, as it is used even when the process of leaving is taking place
in the presence of the speaker.68) ma=beh=nit
    2SG=go=INTERR
    ‘are you leaving?’        Another exception to obligatory marking with the interrogative clitic =nit in
polar questions occurs in traditional Kakua storytelling. This practice requires one
or more “responders” whose role in the event is to respond to the person telling the
story. The response often consists of repeating the last sentence of the main narrator.
This “response” can be understood as a question,4 but the interrogative marker =nit
is not required. Example (69) below comes from a story-telling event of a folktale.
Speaker A is telling the story, and speaker B is the designated “responder”. His or
her duty is to ask questions to the speaker while the story is being told. Speaker B
asks the questions without using the interrogative marker =nit. When inquired about
this, speakers reported that everybody assumes that the denominated “responder” is
asking questions, and therefore the use of the interrogative marker =nit was
considered redundant (although possible):
         4
             I assume this because it is the only accepted translation that speakers give, and also because the
main narrator gives an affirmative answer. Also, when having conversations in Spanish with me, the
Kakua speakers will use the same formula, though in Spanish they will use the interrogative intonation to
indicate that the repetition of the sentence said by one of the speakers represents a ‘rhetorical question’,
or just a figure of speech.

       Question-word interrogative clauses elicit specific information (as opposed to
‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers sought in polar questions). Content questions are formed by
using the relevant question word (the question word can occassionally be omitted,
see below). A list of interrogative words (discussed in Chapter 7) is given in Table
12.3. These interrogative words are derived from the interrogative stem de- (see
Chapter 7 for an extensive description of interrogative pronouns and other question
words).","[349, 350, 351, 352]"

334    A Grammar of Kakua12.10.3 Responding to interrogatives
       Content questions are typically answered with a (declarative) clause, or with
a single word that provides the particular information solicited.
       Polar (yes-no) questions can be responded to positively in two ways: with the
                       ̃̂ ‘yes, aha’ (84)-(85) or by repeating in a declarative form the
affirmative particle hɨhɨ
verb phrase that appeared in the interrogative (86)-(87). Subjects are frequently
dropped, as in (84) and (86).","[352, 353, 354, 355]"

         ‘I have arrived’        Kakua does not have a dedicated ‘no’ particle. The negative existential
wîʔikan serves as an expression of clausal negation. Alternatively, negation can also
be expressed by the verbal suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’ (for verbal negation).
       Either of these two can be used when responding negatively to a question. A
negative response to a polar question can be done by repeating the predicate of the
interrogative clause and adding the negation suffix -kan/-kap (88), or with the clausal

as a response, or just an NP.","[355, 356]"
"
12.10 Interrogative clauses
12.10.0 Interrogative clauses
        Kakua has two main types of interrogative clauses: Content (or question-
word) interrogative clauses, and polar (yes-no) interrogative clauses. Content
questions (§12.10.2 below) are formed by using interrogative pronouns or other
interrogative words like interrogative demonstratives and/or adverbials (see Chapter
7 on interrogative pronouns and question words). Polar interrogative clauses
(§12.10.1 below), on the other hand, are morphologically marked by the clitic =nit.
Interrogative clauses contrast with declarative clauses in that the declarative marker
=na does not occur in interrogative clauses. They do not differ from declarative
clauses in word order. Also no particular intonational pattern is required to
exclusively mark interrogative clauses (although in future work intonation patterns
in interrogative clauses should be looked at carefully).. Interrogative clauses can be
both affirmative and negative. When negative, the verbal predicate must be marked
by the negation suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’, or the negative existential wîɁikan ‘not.exist’
is used. Compare the following examples:54) wã=ʔip    ma-=hiʔ̃́            ʔã=hɨm=nit=be
    1SG=father 2SG=COM              3SG.M=be/exist=INTERR=REC.PST

    WHO=INTS=REC.PST                        3SG.M=EVID-see
    ‘who did he see?’57) dedě=diʔ=ti                            měm       hêjʔ-kan
    WHAT=OBJ=INTS                           2SG        know-NEG
    ‘what do you not know?’       Interrogative clauses differ further from declarative clauses (§12.9 above) in
that interrogative clauses have not been found to occur with the entire range of
evidentiality distinctions (I have found them occuring only with the inferred
evidential markers). Further research should focus on specifically testing for
acceptance of each of the evidential markers in interrogative clauses and explore the
reasons why some (at least the inferred category) are allowed to occur whereas other
categories are not. Examples (55) above and (58) below illustrate interrogative
clauses occurring with the inferred evidential. It is interesting to note that evidential
markers can occur in interrogative clauses, even though one might think that
evidential marking presupposes assertion.
       Additionally, the interrogative marker can also co-occur with the dubitative
mood suffix -hi ‘DUB’ in the same clause, as illustrated in (60) below. See Chapter
10 for further descriptions of interaction of the interrogative mood with evidentiality
and other mood markers.58) měm       ma=ta-naʔa-beh=ta=nit
    2SG        2SG=EVID-want-go=INF.EVID=INTERR
    ‘maybe you want to go?’       Polar interrogative clauses and content interrogative clauses differ in that
polar questions must obligatorily be marked with the interrogative mood clitic =nit,
while in interrogative clauses formed with question words, the presence of = nit is
optional, and it is most often omitted.","[348, 349]"
"
12.13 Responding to imperatives
        Responses to imperative clauses are constructed like responses to questions
(described in §12.10 above under interrogative polar and content questions).
Commands are usually responded to with the particle (interjection) hɨhɨ  ̃̂ ‘yes’, or
another particle with affirmative meaning (see Chapter 3 for a list of particles and
interjections in Kakua), such as da! ‘thereǃ’, among others. Additionally (as with
questions), imperatives can be responded to by repeating the predicate of the
imperative clause in a declarative construction. Example in (111) below illustrates a
response to a command:

        right.now
        ‘yes, alright, I will tell (it to) Armadillo right now’      Negative responses to a command are also constructed like negative responses
to questions. A negative response may involve repeating the predicate in the
imperative clause, adding the negation marker -kan as illustrated in (112):112) A: beh-é
        go-IMP
        ‘goǃ’     B. wã=beh-kan=tʃãhãp
        1SG=go-NEG=PROG
        ‘I am not going’
12.14 Summary
        This chapter describes the basic clause structure in Kakua. A minimal clause
contains at least one predicate. Given that cross-referencing proclitics can stand for
the subject NP of the clause, the overt expression of the subject NP is not obligatory
in order to form a clause. In basic clauses involving predicates with semantically
transitive verb roots, the object argument NP generally precedes the predicate of the
clause. Most other clause types also prefer the basic SOV order of constituents. An
exception to this is the imperative clause, which prefers an OSV order.
        The basic clause structures of copula constructions (affirmative and negative
copular clauses), predicative possessive clauses, comparatives, verbless clauses, and
basic locative clauses were described in sections §12.2 to §12.7 respectively. It was
also shown that nonverbal clauses represent a common strategy in Kakua to express
equative copular meanings.
        This chapter ended with a description of the structure and coding of
declarative, interrogative and imperative (both affirmative and negative) clauses in
§12.10 and §12.11. Kakua declarative clauses represent the default type of clause.
        Additionally, there is a morpheme which expresses an imperative mood for
when the request is to perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The origin
of this morpheme is obscure, and a diachronic explanation is still to be found in
order to have a more accurate approach to analyze the form. Future research,
342   A Grammar of Kakuaincluding perhaps a comparative analysis between Kakua, Nɨkak and other
neighboring languages, will undoubtedly presents us with fascinating hypotheses on
the origin of this form.

13.0 Introduction
       This chapter describes the different mechanisms for combining clauses in
Kakua. This complements chapter 9 where verb serialization was introduced as one
strategy that Kakua has to express a series of events when these events have an
integrated relationship among themselves. In addition to serialization, Kakua has two
other strategies to relate events to one another: coordination and subordination.
          i)       Coordination: the symmetrical relation of events, or events that are
conceptually less integrated.
          ii)      Subordination: an asymmetrical relation of events (clauses) in
which one depends, grammatically and semantically, on a higher clause, i.e.
subordination. Subordination is a strategy that falls in between the expression of
events that are considered as more conceptually integrated (verb serialization) and
events that are less conceptually integrated (coordination).
       Section §13.1 provides a description of the two main strategies of
coordination in Kakua: i) simple juxtaposition of the coordinated clauses; or ii) use
of a coordinator particle. 1 The specific properties of each subtype of subordinate
clauses (complement, relative, and adverbial) are described in §13.2-§13.5.","[361, 362, 363, 364]"
"
10.4.2 Interrogative mood =nit
       The interrogative marker in Kakua serves to express questions (polar
questions, see Chapter 12 section §12.10 for the description of polar and content
questions). An interrogative implies a “non-assertion” (see Palmer 2001:52-53), and
as a type of illocution, it represents an ‘unqualified question’ without necessarily
implying the speaker’s commitment, attitudes or even expectations towards the
answer. The interrogative marker is mutually exclusive with declarative and
imperative illocution markers.
       The interrogative marker in Kakua is the clitic =nit ‘INTER’, and although its
most common host is the predicate (verb; as in Table 10.3 above), as in example
(53), the interrogative marker can also attach to other parts of speech such as
pronouns (54), nominalized or adjectivized verbs (55), or NPs (56):53) Mitú=bǔ            beh=nit

           Taking into account that a quotation in Kakua can also be expressed as a reported situation, I
do not undertake here a discussion of the differences between quotative and reportative evidentiality,
given that there is no distinction between these two in Kakua.

10.4.3 Imperative mood: –Ṽ́ ‘IMP’, -kabuhú ‘NEG.IMP’, and -ʔabuhú ‘IMP2’
       The last category of illocution is the imperative mood. The imperative mood
expresses commands. Commands in Kakua can be expressed by three different
markers that encode specific types of commands. A positive command, which is
marked with the suffix -Ṽ́, a negative command, marked with the suffix -kabuhú,
and a command that solicits an action to be performed for the benefit of someone
else, marked with the suffix -ʔabuhú.
         Like declarative and interrogative moods, the imperative moods can serve
to form types of clauses. The host of the imperative suffixes is the predicate (or verb
as in Table 10.3). Examples of these three imperative markers are given below:59) kan=diʔ měm                 ma=fwẽh-é
    3SG=OBJ 2SG                  2SG=leave-IMP

    ‘take it out (for somebody else)’        10
            Note that, unlike the interrogative, the dubitative modality does not express a question, given
that the category of modality, as adopted here from Hengeveld (2004), does not have the ability to form
clause types. A question is a type of clause, whereas the dubitative modality expresses doubt, and not
necessarily a question. See the description on dubitative modality in §10.5.1 below.
                                         Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality     287        Usually additional modality (and tense and aspect) distinctions are not
expressed in imperative clauses. Whenever the clause is further specified for these
distinctions, the TAME markers occur on another element of the clause, which can
take all of the needed TAME morphology:62) ma=ʔɨb-ɨ ̃́          hit-at              pînaʔ   nih=wɨt=hĩ

clauses that they form is given in Section §12.11.","[307, 308]"

       The following sections provide descriptions of the different types of
independent clauses in Kakua. Declarative clauses are described in §12.9, followed
by a section describing interrogative polar and content questions (§12.10). Section
§12.11 provides a description of affirmative imperative clauses and §12.12 of
negative imperatives. These sections show that these types of clauses differ in their
possibility of encoding evidential categories.
       All of these clause types have dedicated markers, as given in Table 11.2
below. Additional description and exemplification of these markers are also
presented in other chapters. Chapter 10 on TAME describes the meanings of these
markers in the context of other markers encoding mood, e.g., frustrative, dubitative,
and other moods. Chapter 8 gives a basic template of the verb and describes the
syntactic position of these markers within the verbal word.","[346, 347]"

3.3     Closed classes
3.3.0 Introduction
       This section describes the closed classes of words. These classes in Kakua are
parts of speech whose membership is limited and that do not allow for the
introduction of new elements.
       As opposed to the elements that form the open classes of words, the
morphology of the members of the closed classes is more restricted, i.e., closed
classes of words have a smaller range of bound morphemes with which they can
occur compared to the members of the open classes.
       The members of the closed classes do not allow for an unlimited number of
elements. This justifies their recognition as closed word classes.
       The closed classes of words in Kakua are: pronouns, interrogative pronouns
and question words, demonstratives, numerals, quantifiers, adjectives, adverbs and
other particles such as emphasis tags, discourse particles, exclamations, interjections,
and hesitation particles.
       Each of these closed classes are introduced in the following subsections and
discussed in detail in further relevant chapters. An overview of Kakua’s pronominal
paradigm is given in §3.3.1; interrogative pronouns and question words are described
in §3.3.2. Demonstratives are presented in §3.3.3. A summarized description of
numerals and quantifiers is presented in §3.3.4. The closed set of adjectives and how
adjectives can be formed is described in §3.3.5. Adverbs are described in §3.3.6.
Finally, the main range of Kakua’s assorted particles is be described in §3.3.7.",[132]
"7.1    Personal pronouns
       The Kakua pronominal system has three different sets of forms: free forms,
bound pronouns (that serve to express possessive relations as described in §5.3, or
to encode cross-reference to the subject argument as described in Chapter 8), and
possessive pronouns (occurring in alienable possession, described in §5.3). Table 7.1
summarizes the forms and functions of the three sets of pronouns in Kakua.
212       A Grammar of KakuaTable 7.1 Personal pronouns

        As can be seen in Table 7.1, Kakua pronouns encode person and number.
Gender is specified only for the 3 rd person singular forms. The 3rd person singular
pronoun kǎn ‘3SG.M’ is obviously related to the proximate demonstrative form kan
‘PROX.DEM’. The 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn ‘3SG.M’, can in principle be used
for inanimate referents (‘this/it’), and animate male (or unspecified for gender)
referents (‘he’) (it is a non-feminine form, see below) and is glossed in the texts as
‘3SG.M’. For inanimate 3rd person singular referents, the demonstrative form kan is
used most often. Therefore, kan is glossed as either ‘PROX.DEM’ or ‘3SG.M’ according
to the context. If encoding deixis is its main function, then it is glossed as
‘PROX.DEM’, whereas if in pronominal function it refers to an inanimate referent, it
is glossed as ‘3SG.M’. Section §7.3 below describes the forms and functions of
demonstratives in Kakua.
        Gender distinctions in the forms for 3rd singular pronouns are best understood
as feminine versus non-feminine.1 The forms kǎnʔ and mi= strictly encode female
gender for 3rd person singular, while for all other referents, the pronouns kǎn
‘3SG.M’ and ʔã= ‘3SG.M’ are used even when the gender of the referent is not strictly
male, or is unspecified. All of the pronominal forms shown in Table 7.1 above, can
be further specified by feminine gender. This is done by attaching the feminine suffix
classifier -wili:2)      wěm-wili
        1SG-CL:fem
        ‘I (female)’
1
    For the sake of consistency, kǎn, ʔã= and ʔãǰʔ=, are glossed as ‘3SG.M’ throughout this work, even
when the referent is not male.

     chase.away-A.NMLZ
     ‘he was the one who chased away the jaguars’ (he was the jaguar chaser)       The bound pronouns (proclitics) are normally bound to a head noun or verb.
When bound to verbs, the proclitics serve as cross-references to the subject argument
of the clause (see Chapter 6 on argument marking in Kakua).
       The set of pronouns that are called “bound pronouns” can also occur without
being attached to a head noun or verb, but in this case the bound pronoun must
always be followed by another clitic to form a phonological word. The contexts
motivating the constructions of the pronouns without a head noun or verb need to be
explored in future research.
       An example of the proclitic occurring with additional morphology only,
lacking a head noun or verb, is illustrated in (5) below:5)   fwɨb=be               mâ-naʔ          kan      ʔã=be           wɨw

     1SG=recognize=INF.EVID=INTS          3SG.M=REC.PST caiman
     ‘I came back, (with) a stick I recognized the caiman, he must have been a
     caiman!’        Unlike the free pronouns, the forms of the bound pronouns do not have lexical
tone specification; instead, their tone value is assigned by the elements in the
surrounding environment to which the proclitics are attached (usually the tonal value
is assigned by the roots to which the pronoun is clitized). In cases such as the one
presented in (5) above, where the bound pronoun lacks a head, and instead it occurs
only with other morphology, which are themselves also toneless, the entire set of
bound morphemes is realized with a low tone.
        When pronominal forms function as subjects, objects, or comitative or
locative adjuncts they take case markers indicating their function within the clause:
214     A Grammar of Kakua6)    kǎnʔ       kan=diʔ            mi=t-hěmʔ-ep=wɨt=be
      3SG.F         3SG.M=OBJ        3SG.F=EVID-eat-PST=REP.EVID=REC.PST
      ‘She ate it’ (it is said)       As described in Chapter 5, (bound) pronouns can be used to indicate
possessive relationships. Inalienably possessed nouns take bound pronouns, while
alienably and inherently possessed nouns take the possessive (bound) pronouns (see
Chapter 5, §5.3, for description of possession). As mentioned in Chapter 5 (§5.3),
the possessive pronominal forms in Kakua are derived from a combination of the
bound forms of the pronouns with the possessor marker –íʔ. This is shown in Table
7.1 above in the column of possessive pronouns. An example of an alienably
possessed noun marked with the possessive bound pronoun is given in example (7)
below:7) ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ                   kǎn     kãk=bɨt
   3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC               3SG.M    person=ALSO     ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ
     3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC
     ‘[they parted…], he (the armadillo) on his way, and the person also on his way’        Free pronominal forms do not have variants when used as possessive forms.
        Kakua pronouns can have anaphoric functions, referring back to a previously
mentioned noun or noun phrase, as discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 (§11.2 on
subject alignment).
          In Kakua narratives, usually a (3SG.M) pronoun is sufficient to refer to the
main participant of the story, and the expression of the participant as a lexical noun
is not necessary. Example (8) below illustrates a situation in which two participants
of the narrated event are being referred to by using 3SG.M pronouns only:8)    kǎn        kǎn=diʔ           ʔã=t-těw-hip=tagǎ
      3SG.M        3SG.M=OBJ         3SG.M=EVID-shot.darts-DUB=INF.EVID
      ‘he (the person) shot darts to him (the jaguar)’       Like the demonstrative form kan (see above), the third person pronoun can
also be used for generic reference to inanimate entities in general, or abstract
concepts like thoughts, feelings, or ideas. The bound pronoun highlighted in bold in
example (9), anaphorically refers to the derived noun higaɁ-at     ̃̂      be.sad-NMLZ
‘sadness’. It can also be translated into ‘it (the sadness)’. Example (10) illustrates an
instance of the pronoun kǎn used for generic anaphoric reference.

7.2     Interrogative pronouns and question words
       The interrogative pronouns in Kakua are built from the element de-, to which
other morphological material is added. The interrogative pronominal forms are given
in Table 7.2 below:Table 7.2 Interrogative Pronouns

  who                                      dêʔe       These pronouns can be used as arguments of clauses, as shown in the
following examples:11) dêʔe=ti=be                    mem=diʔ          ʔã=t-ʔên

    ‘I’m saying, who is going to talk?’       An interrogative mood marker =nit may optionally be cliticized to the verb
of the clause, as found in (14)-(16) below.14) dedě=tigá          kǎn     pant   nih=nit

    ‘what do you want?’16) dêdʔ=ti            ma=nâʔ=nit
    which=INTS          2SG=want=INTERR
    ‘which (one) do you want?’       Interrogative pronouns, as is the case for the rest of the pronominal forms in
Kakua, do not have different forms when functioning as subject, object, comitative,
locative, etc. Thus, if functioning as an object argument, for example, the
interrogative pronoun does not change its basic form and instead it optionally takes
the object case marker, compare examples (15) and (16) with (17) and (18) below:17) dêʔe=diʔ=ti=be                 ma=ʔên
    who=OBJ=INTS=REC.PST            2SG=see

    what=OBJ=INTS 2SG           know
    ‘what (story) do you know?’        Interrogative pronouns can take the possessive suffix -íʔ to encode possessive
relations, as in (19), or be compounded to a noun stem as in (20) below. Note that
in cases such as that illustrated in example (20) below, the interrogative pronoun is
not considered a procliticized form (as with the proclitic personal pronouns) because,
unlike proclitic personal pronouns (possessive personal pronouns), the interrogative
pronoun can stand on its own, like other interrogative words (i.e., can occur
syntactically unbound, like example (23) below where the interrogative dě ‘where’
occurs on its own. Most commonly, however, the interrogative pronouns occur
together with intensifiers or emphasis markers):19) dêʔe-íʔ  tigǎ     nin-mɨ ̃̌-hǐw

    ‘whose son did you see?’        Kakua has a set of forms that are homophonous to the element de- present in
the interrogative forms: the inferred future evidentiality enclitic =dê ‘INF.FUT.EVID’;
and the noun dê ‘relative’ (‘person who is related). The extent to which these forms
may or may not be related is unknown.

that are also built from the element de-. These question words are given in Table 7.3

built on a basic de- form. Semantically, both interrogative pronouns and question
words can be considered to fall into one class of interrogative words. Functionally,
however, these words form two different sets: the set of interrogative words that
have pronominal function, and the set of interrogative words with adverbial
functions.

        Kakua has a demonstrative system which makes three distinctions: proximate,
distal, and immediate proximate. The forms of demonstratives are given in Table 7.4
below:Table 7.4 Kakua demonstrative pronouns
 Function                                            Form Demonstrative Pronoun Proximate ‘there/this’
                                                             kan                                                             kun ~ kǔn ~ nun
 Distal ‘that’
                          masculine ‘this right              nin
 Immediate                here’
 proximate                feminine ‘this right               ninʔ
                          here’        The proximate and distal demonstrative forms, kan and kun respectively, can
be specified for gender if necessary (unlike immediate proximate forms, which are
already inflected for feminine gender in their basic form). In such cases, the classifier
-wili may be suffixed to the demonstrative form as follows: kan-wili ‘this (female)’,
and kun-wili ‘that (female)’.
        Additionally, the 3rd person singular feminine personal pronoun, kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’,
can be used as a demonstrative when referring to female animate beings that are
(spatially) proximate to the speaker, and in such cases it is preferred over kan-wili.
        As mentioned in §7.1 above regarding the 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’, both kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kan ‘PROX.DEM’ can be used with the same deictic
meaning. It is also possible that the proximate demonstrative form kan was the
historical source of the pronominal forms kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ (following a
crosslinguistically common development of 3 rd person pronouns from
demonstrative), but the pronominal forms include further phonological
specifications, which suggests that a reverse development might also be possible.
        The proximate demonstrative kan ‘PROX.DEM’ is used to refer to objects
which are spatially close to speaker, to the hearer or to both. It is not used for objects
immediately next to the speaker, for which the immediate proximate demonstrative,
nin or ninʔ, is used. The proximate demonstrative is also used to refer to something
that has already been mentioned in the discourse, e.g. ‘the one there’, or ‘this
aforementioned’ object. The proximate demonstrative can be translated as English
‘this’ or ‘there’, and is glossed as such where appropriate:27) kan=jǔb=pûʔba
    there=EMPHZ:be.true=EMPH
    ‘right there, all right!’

singular pronouns kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’, and can function in any grammatical
role in a clause: subject, object, or adjunct:30) kan=diʔ             hɨ ̃̂dʔɨ=diʔ=ka               ʔã=t-beh-ep

    there=LOC=ALSO=REM.PST 3SG.M             3SG.M=exist-NMLZ
    ‘he lived over there also’        The distal demonstrative kun ‘DIST.DEM’ is used to refer to referents far away
from the speaker, hearer, or both (32). Its alternate forms are kǔn and nun. The use
of the distal demonstrative is usually accompanied by a pointing gesture signaling
towards the (imagined, in the case of stories, for example) location of the referred
entity. The referent can be either visible or not visible to speaker and hearer. This
distal demonstrative has an alternate form nun as shown in Table 7.4 above. The
criteria conditioning the use of one over the other seem to correspond to clan dialectal
variation but need to be investigated further.","[233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"

10.2.3 Telic progressive aspect: suffix -fɨɁɨ
       The suffix -fɨɁɨ ‘TEL.PROG’ serves to express a situation that, like the one
described for the progressive aspect above, encodes the continuity of an
(imperfective) event, but additionally it also particularly encodes an event which
must have an end point. For lack of a better term, I am labeling this suffix as a telic
progressive. This suffix partially conforms to the general definition of telic aspect, 4         4
           For the general definition of telic aspect I follow here Comrie’s (1975:44-45) definition of telic
as “a telic situation is one that involves a process that leads up to a well-defined terminal point beyond
                                                   Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality                279but doesn’t fully conform to this. Like a telic aspect, the suffix -fɨɁɨ in Kakua does
express “a process that leads up to a well-defined terminal point…’ (Comrie
1975:44-45); however, unlike telic (as defined in Comrie 1975:44-45), the telic
progressive suffix in Kakua doesn’t necessarily encode that the situation cannot
continue beyond the terminal point defined. In other words, the telic progressive
aspect in Kakua specifies that the situation is occurring up to a terminal point, but
this terminal point is not necessarily the end point of the situation, as this situation
may still continue (see example (38) below, where the endpoint of the activity, i.e.,
stop eating, does not necessarily entail that the object of the activity, i.e., the food,
will also be finished once the eating has stopped).
        The telic progressive aspect suffix in Kakua is translated with the adverbial
form in English ‘still’ or ‘yet’, where the situation described is still occurring (and
in this sense is an imperfective situation) but is expected to have, at some point, an
intrinsic end.
        Some examples of the telic progressive suffix are given below. It is important
to highlight, however, that the occurrence of this suffix in the corpus is not very
common, and only after being prompted with specific elicitations was I able to gather
sufficient data to support the semantics of this form. It is curious, though, that Kakua
bilingual speakers in Spanish will persistently use the Spanish adverb todavía (‘still’
or ‘yet’), but in their constructions in Kakua they will rather use the progressive form
ʧãhãp described above. When questioned regarding the possibility of translating the
same sentences with todavía into Kakua by using the telic progressive suffix -fɨɁɨ
‘TEL.PROG’, instead of the ‘default’ progressive ʧãhãp ‘PROG’ speakers concluded
that translations of todavía sentences with -fɨɁɨ ‘TEL.PROG’ might be more accurate,
though the use of the progressive ʧãhãp in the todavía sentences was not regarded
as incompatible either. The examples below do come from natural text.38) hěmɁ-fɨɁɨ=na
    eat-TEL.PROG=DECL
    ‘(she) still eats’39) ʧɨ ̃̂d-fɨɁɨ=na
    sit-TEL.PROG=DECL
    ‘still sitting’40) jâwa-fɨɁɨ=na=hĩ
    fill.up.liquid-TEL.PROG=DECL=REM.PST
    ‘(he) was still filling up’       Having an implied reference to an ending point, the telic progressive aspect
can be said to be in competition with the progressive in situations that can be
interpreted both as atelic or telic. This may explain why in some cases Kakuawhich the process cannot continue […] In expressions referring to telic situations it is important that there
should be both a process leading up to the terminal point as well as the terminal point”
280    A Grammar of Kakuaspeakers accept both progressive ʧãhãp and telic progressive -fɨɁɨ. One such example
is given in (41) and (42) below. Example (41) occurred in natural speech. Sentence
(42) was elicited during the dry season. Given that the dry season was expected to
end soon, the speaker accepted the elicited form in (42) as valid because of previous
knowledge of an end point of the situation. Note that in any case, there is no overlap
of the progressive and the telic progressive forms:                ̌ ʔ=na=ka
41) bɨ húptʃi hɨw                                         ʔã=tʃãhãp

42) bɨ húptʃi hɨw
    now       summer come-TEL.PROG=DECL=ASS
    ‘now summer is still coming’        Finally, it is possible to consider that the telic progressive suffix -fɨɁɨ is either
falling in disuse (for which a test comparing its use across generations would be
needed), or that it has just recently been introduced into Kakua (for which
comparative evidence would be required). Only future research will give more
answers to the fascinating semantics and uses of this telic progressive aspect -fɨɁɨ.","[299, 300, 301]"
"1.4     A problematic grouping: the linguistic classification of Kakua
       For more than one century, Kakua has been grouped into a so-called ‘Makú’
family. Recent work has reconsidered the postulation of such a family and proposes,
instead, a reevaluation of the grouping and a reassessment of the family name (cf.,
Epps & Bolaños submitted for a thorough discussion of the ‘Makú’ family and its
putative members).
       The term ‘Makú’ in itself served as a cultural category used by other groups
of the area to refer to any group of peoples whose subsistence pattern was that of
hunting and gathering. Apparently the ‘Makú’ term was not intended as a linguistic
category for these groups. Nonetheless, many scholars insisted in r eferring to the
‘Makú’ peoples as members of what has been called a ‘Makú’ linguistic family.
       The history of this classification is very interesting as novel data ever more
available permits a re-evaluation of this unsupported language family.
       The so-called ‘Makú’ family9 included the languages Kakua and Nɨkak, Hup,
Yuhup, Dâw, Nadëb, and Puinave.
       In 1906, Theodor Koch-Grünberg, an earlier German ethnographer whose
works are benchmarks for many studies in the Upper Rio Negro region in general,
visited the area where presumably Kakua, Dâw and Yuhup were spoken. He
publishes then a list of words collected from these languages, calling them ‘Makú of
Río Curicuriarý’ (presumably speakers of Dâw; see wordlist in Koch-Grünberg
1906:885ff), ‘Makú of Río Tiquié’ (presumably speakers of Yuhup;see wordlist in
Koch-Grünberg 1906:885ff), and ‘Makú of Río Papurí’ (presumably speakers of
Kakua inhabiting the surroundings of the Makú-Igarapé stream, a tributary of the
Papurí, and the current local settlement of the Kakua peoples of Nuevo Pueblo (see
the wordlist in Koch-Grünberg 1906:885ff).
       Koch-Grünberg observes a relationship between Dâw and Yuhup: “many
words are identical in both languages or have only minor dialectal differences, some
of which are probably also attributable to the difficulty in recording” (Koch-
        9 Other names for this family are Makú-Puinave, Puinave-Makú (Greenberg 1960) and Makú
stock (Loutkotka 1968).
14     A Grammar of KakuaGrünberg 1906: 881-882).10 When it comes to Kakua, however, he is very careful
with proposing a relationship between Kakua and Yuhup (Makú of Río Tiquié) and
Dâw (Makú of Río Curicuriarý), and rather includes in a footnote a list of 9 lexical
resemblances between Yuhup and Kakua (Koch-Grünberg 1906:882 footnote).
        Although Koch-Grünberg says that the sound of these three languages is
similar, he is emphatic in saying that only with great reservations can Kakua (Makú
of Papurý) be counted as a member of the same group (1906:882).
        A few years later, Paul Rivet and Constant Tastevin provide data on Nadëb,
and in 1920 they publish an article with the first proposal for a genetic relationship
between Kakua, Yuhup, Dâw, and Nadëb, and they include Puinave.
        Rivet & Tastevin’s proposal considered Kakua, Dâw and Yuhup (and Nadëb),
as dialects of one and the same ‘Makú’ language, since, according to them, the
relationship among these languages had already been established by Koch-Grünberg.
Thus, the missing data in any of these ‘Makú’ dialects was not regarded since an
entry from another ‘dialect’ of the same language was just enough for them to make
their point on comparing the ‘Makú’ dialects with the Puinave language.
        They also appeal to Koch-Grünberg’s careful notes when in 1913 (1913:471)
he states that the sound of Puinave reminds him of the Makú languages from the Río
Negro. Rivet & Tastevin, however, lack to include also Koch-Grünberg’s mention
that the Puinave language had lexically nothing in common with the Makú languages
of the Río Negro.
        Rivet & Tastevin conclude that due to the similarities found (based strongly
on pronominal forms that derive in large part from transcription errors, and other
lexical entries that have themselves also many transcription flaws), and the “previous
observations” of Koch-Grünberg, the ‘Makú’ dialects should be considered as
genetically related to Puinave, and therefore they propose a Makú-Puinave family.
        This affiliation proposed by Rivet & Tastevin remained widely accepted,
mainly due to lack of additional data on these languages. With the addition of Hup
and Nɨkak into the ‘Makú’ family classification, many scholars continued to refer to
these languages as members of the family until the end of the 20th century (e.g.
Nimuendajú 1950: 149, Greenberg 1960, Loukotka 1968 [1935]: 190-193, Mason
1950: 257, Kaufman 1990: 41, 1994: 60, Campbell 1997: 183).
        The early 21st century saw a change in this, and many scholars began to
question the ‘Makú’ classification or raised doubts about one or some of its members.
Martins & Martins (1999) question the affiliation of Puinave to the ‘Makú’ family.
        V. Martins (2005: 331-2, 341) suggests a relationship between two Makú
branches: an Eastern Makú branch (Makú Oriental) in which he includes Hup,
Yuhup, Dâw and Nadëb; and a Western Makú branch (Makú Ocidental) in which he
includes Kakua, Nɨkak (see Cabrera et al. 1999; Mahecha 2009; Mahecha et al. 2000
for linguistic information on Nɨkak) and Puinave (see Girón 2008 for a linguistic
        10 Original in German “Viele Wörter sind in beiden Sprachen identisch oder weisen nur geringe
dialektische Unterschiede auf, die zum Teil wohl auch der Schwierigkeit bei der Aufnahme zuzuschreiben
sind.”
                                         Introduction: Kakua and its speakers      15description of Puinave). This latter branch, he states, cannot be clearly demonstrated
although it is considered probable. Martins’ Eastern and Western branches together
conform what he proposes as a Macro-Makú family.
        Epps (2005:10; 2008) critically questions the ‘Makú’ grouping, and presents
a skeptical view of affiliating Kakua, Nɨkak, and Puinave with what she suggested
should be called a Nadahup family –the members of which are Hup, Yuhup, Dâw
and Nadëb.
        Finally, Girón (2008:428-435), also questioning the ‘Makú’ grouping
(Puinave included), presents evidence that can play both in favor or against, a ‘Makú’
linguistic classification, and states that the evidence is inconclusive to claim that
these languages form a linguistic family (here Girón includes Puinave, Kakua, Nɨkak,
Hup, Yuhup, Dâw and Nadëb).
        In 2009, with newly available data from Kakua, Bolaños & Epps (2009) take
a critical position towards the classification of Kakua into the Nadahup language
group, arguing that regular sound correspondences were not found to support such a
linguistic relationship. Puinave was not included in Bolaños & Epps’ 2009
comparative study.
        Only in 2015, with extensive data on Kakua, Hup and more novel data on
Dâw, Epps & Bolaños (submitted) conclude that the linguistic evidence does not
support a genetic affiliation between Nadahup and Kakua, Nɨkak and Puinave.
Furthermore, they suggest a Nadahupan language family –which includes Hup,
Yuhup, Dâw, Nadëb-, a Kakua-Nukakan family (including Kakua and Nɨkak, see
Epps & Bolaños submitted), and Puinave as a separate language from these families.
They strongly discourage the continued use of the term ‘Makú’ since it does not
represent a linguistic classification and because of its highly pejorative social
connotations for the speakers of these languages.","[35, 36, 37]"

are no free possessive pronouns such as English ‘his, their, my’. The free forms of
personal pronouns cannot be possessed, i.e. they cannot take the possessor suffix –

11.5 Summary
        The word order and alignment of arguments in Kakua can be summarized as
follows:
 Kakua shows a strong preference for the SOV ordering of its constituents.
     Alternative orders follow a preferentiality scale, from most preferred SOV to
     least preferred (but attested with restrictions) VOS.
 Most preferred orders are verb-final, with objects preceding the verb.
 The coding of subject arguments is of the head-marking type.
 Subject arguments are not morphologically marked for case.
 Kakua A arguments and S arguments are not different morphosyntactically. This
     conforms to a typical nominative-accusative type of alignment, where A and S
     arguments are equal, while different from P arguments: A=S≠P.
314    A Grammar of Kakua     The marking of object arguments is of the dependent-marking type. Nouns or
      NPs functioning as object arguments are marked by case with the case marker
      =diʔ.
     Differential Object Marking (DOM) criteria govern the overtness of
      morphological marking of object arguments.
     The object case marker =diʔ serves to mark NPs functioning as object
      arguments in several different semantic roles.
     The alignment of object arguments corresponds to a neutral type of object
      alignment, where P=T=R.

          Basic clause structure and types of clauses
12.0   Introduction
       This chapter describes the basic clause structure and the different clause types
in Kakua. Section §12.1 provides an introductory overview of the minimal
requirements to form a clause. Section §12.2 gives a description of copular
constructions involving predicative and existential copulas. In addition to affirmative
existential copulas, Kakua also has a negative existential copula; this type of negative
existential is described in §12.3. Section §12.4 gives a description of predicative
possession. This is followed by a description of comparative constructions in §12.5,
and non-verbal predicates expressing equation in §12.6. Finally, §12.7 provides a
description of the basic locative constructions.
       This chapter concludes with a description of Kakua clause types, presented in
4 subsections: declarative clauses in §12.9; interrogative clauses, both polar and
content interrogatives, in §12.10; imperative clauses in §12.11; and negative
imperative clauses in §12.12. Responses to imperative clauses are described in
§12.13, and a summary is found in §12.14.
12.1   Minimal clause
        A basic sentence in Kakua is composed of at least one independent clause.
An intransitive clause is minimally composed of a predicate (with optional
indexation of the subject by means of a cross-referencing proclitic), as in (1); or an
optional subject NP and a predicate, as in (2), where the subject NP typically
precedes the predicate (SV). Transitive clauses minimally contain a predicate;
additionally, transitive clauses typically contain an overt object NP (though not
obligatorily); the subject NP is optional, and it may be indexed on the predicate by
means of cross-referencing proclitics (3), which are themselves also optional (see
Chapter 11 for description of criteria governing the occurrence of proclitics). In
transitive clauses, the object NP typically precedes the predicate of the clause (SOV)
(4)-(6).                   ̃̌ ʔ=hĩ

12.2     The affirmative existential copular verb hɨm
        The affirmative existential verb hɨm is used in predicative and existential
copular constructions to encode existence, and also permanent states and attribution,
as discussed in this section. Equative constructions in Kakua use a different strategy,
and are formed by the juxtaposition of the NPs without the use of the existential verb
hɨm (see §12.6 below). Note that the verb hɨm ‘exist’, which is referred to as a copula
here, can function as a predicate on its own, whereas the canonical definition of
copulas expects copulas to not be able to function as predicates on their own right;
see Hengeveld (1992). Examples below illustrate copula constructions in Kakua,
using the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ in its different functions to express permanent
states, existence/location, and attribution:7) jeděʔ-wã    jěb    hɨm=nit

    ‘Hamu is very sadǃ       The basic structure of predicative and existential copular constructions in
Kakua does not differ from that shown for other types of verbal constructions
(intransitive, monotransitive, ditransitive), in which the verb is (preferably) in final
position, being preceded by the object and the subject/agent arguments: SOV( cop).
Thus, a copular construction is also preferably of the type SOV. The copular verb in
Kakua takes all of the verbal morphology (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of verbal
morphology). This include interrogative mood (14) and tense and aspect (14)-(17)
(see also the examples above in this section), cross-referencing proclitics,
morphemes indicating evidentiality, as in (16), and nominalizers, as in (17):

318      A Grammar of Kakua12.3     The negative existential verb wîʔikan
        In addition to the affirmative existential copular verb hɨm, Kakua has an
inherently negative stative verb wîʔikan denoting the meanings of ‘not to have or not
to exist’. This form can be further analyzed into two morphemes, a verb root wîʔi-
and the verbal negation suffix –kan. However, the root wîʔi- is obligatorily bound
and cannot occur without the negation suffix –kan, and this verb is thus considered
to be a single negative existential expression. The negative existential verb, like other
Kakua verbs, takes all the verbal morphology available to verbs in general: cross-
referencing proclitics (18); TAM affixes (18)-(20), evidentiality prefixes and/or
enclitics (as in (18)-(20)), and derivational suffixes to form adjectives (21):18) hiw=bɨt                  ʔã=t-wîʔikan=na

    3SG.M         eye-not.exist-ADJVZ=ASS
    ‘he is blind’(lit. ‘there is no eye’)       Additionally, it can form an utterance on its own, and is often sufficient as a
negative response to a question (of the English type ‘no’) as exemplified below:22) Q. ʔã=t-ʔên=nit                ʔã=t-bìdi=nit=hĩ
       3SG.M=EVID-see=INTERR         3SG.M=EVID-search=INTERR=REM.PST
       ‘did he look? did he search?’       A wîʔikan
         ‘no’       Although the affirmative existential verb hɨm can also be negated by attaching
the negation suffix -kan to it, Kakua speakers strongly prefer using the negative
existential wîʔikan, when the predicative or existential clause is negative. Negating

10.4 Illocution
10.4.0 Introduction
        Illocution refers to a semantic subgroup of mood markers that function to
express the communicative intention with which the speaker presents a proposition.
As such, the communicative status of the proposition in Kakua can be that of an
assertion, a question, or a command. This section deals with these three basic
illocution markers, namely declarative (§10.4.1), interrogative (§10.4.2), and
imperative (§10.4.3).
        The markers of illocution are presented here only briefly in order to illustrate
their semantics. This is because these markers have a formal distinction as well as a
semantic one: they have the ability to form clause types (clause types are described       5
           A formal description of illocution marking is presented in Chapter 12 (clause types).
282   A Grammar of Kakuain Chapter 12, sections §12.9, §12.10, and §12.11 for declarative, interrogative, and
imperative clauses respectively. Negation is also described in Chapter 12).
       In the characterization of the morphological markers of illocution, Hengeveld
notes that “by their very nature, basic illocutions [this is declarative, interrogative
and imperative, KB] are restricted to independent sentences and quotations. This
feature will be of help in distinguishing illocutionary from modal categories”
(Hengeveld 2004:1191). This is, however, not a characteristic of the morphological
markers of illocution in Kakua, for these markers are not restricted to independent
clauses and may occur in subordinate clauses (see example (47) below, and Chapter
13, for examples of declarative marker occurring in subordinated clauses).
       The different markers of illocution mood in Kakua are summarized in Table
10.3 below.","[302, 303]"

     For the Kakua people,
        and those who left.
Y para mi papi y mami, que
       permanezca lo bello.
       Acknowledgments
         After the many years it took me to sew this grammar together, I couldn’t
possibly come up with a fair list of all the people who helped me on my way.
Completing a dissertation is not only a writing process, but also an emotional ride
of happiness, excitement and despair.
         First, I owe the most heartfelt gratitude to the Kakua people, who allowed for
me to meet them back in 2008, and who later became a group of friends, a family,
taking care of me during the long walks in the inhospitable forest. With patience
they taught me the simplest, most beautiful appreciation for the sublime things and
beings in life. I thank those Kakua ‘who left’ to the forest and did not return, who
left life and kept on going, who passed away and are deeply missed. I especially
want to thank the women of Wacará for their power, for lovingly taking care of me,
and for showing me the formidable force of female wisdom. No acknowledgments
section is long enough, and no language is fair enough to express my gratitude for
the Kakua people.
         I greatly thank my supervisors who had to struggle along with my own
difficulties and periods of being stuck with a single problem, periods that seemed
like a string of eternities. At times I was filled with motivation, but at many others
it felt as if I was only being dragged through to barely make it to an end, or even a
starting, point. Some other times, I was delivering only because I couldn’t bare the
embarrassment of not keeping up with all of the support that seemed to have been
earned without fair merit from my end. I owe my gratitude to Frank Seifart who had
to face the worst effects of frustration, and who had made many sacrifices to walk
along with me and make this dissertation possible; I’m sure that I am still unaware
of many of his sacrifices. Kees Hengeveld always intervened with warm enthusiasm,
and he always offered emotional motivation that transcended beyond the dissertation
itself. Finally, I blame Pattie Epps more than anyone for both the beginning and the
end of this project. It was she who first encouraged me to undertake the
documentation and description of Kakua, and through the inspiration that she spreads
with her passion and endless motivation, even at the least promising times, I kept on
enjoying the ride of building the puzzle that the grammar of Kakua represents to me,
always positively affected by Pattie’s fascination for the project as if it was herself
going through every second of the time it took me to understand Kakua. Thank you
also for warmly taking care of me, personally and academically.
         At the University of Texas at Austin, where I spent my first years of academic
training in linguistics, I also splash some of the blame onto Nora England, who would
unconditionally offer me support, care and force, filling me with the confidence to
face the best parts and the nasty bits of these past years.
         Also at UT Austin, my professors and fellow students provided me with an
inspirational academic environment from which this grammar has greatly benefited.
         My friends Ana Paula Brandão, Telma Can, and Thiago Vital were the
familiar and loving support that only friends can offer when home is far away.
        The department of linguistics at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig stepped
in in 2012 to offer an unbeatable setting for academic development. I thank my
colleagues there for the academic inspiration towards a growth in the fascination for
science.
        My time in Leipzig was filled with colors and love from my friends Iren
Hartmann and Diana Schackow, reaffirming and redefining the meaning of
friendship and family beyond what I have ever experienced: Diana, motivated by
such caring love that she even suffered an uncomfortable train ride to come to my
rescue, and Iren, guiding me out of the darkest places with her strength, compassion
and love. Not only did both my friends provide me with important doses of much
needed alcohol and food, but also left a permanent impression of inspiration and of
strong loving women in academics, as well as friends and family. May life continue
to bring us together, and keep both of you as beautiful, strong and loving as the
women as you are.
        Also in Leipzig, Heriberto Avelino made sure of my emotional wellbeing,
and while he wasn’t exactly a model of decency (more of moral decay and chocolate
overdoses), I hold him deep in my heart for his friendship and love.
        In the world in general I have always run into Martin Kohlberger and always
will, and since I’m such a superstitious person I rapidly learnt that it meant he was
going to be that big part of my heart. I gave in and I couldn’t have had better times
and better laughs. Even during the most obscure times I would always be cheered by
the joy and love that he spreads. Thank you for helping me getting through the rough
unpaved parts of these past years. This grammar is silently infested with your
greatness.
        I thank Sasha Aikhenvald for the time in Cairns and the enthusiasm towards
the completion of this dissertation, and for her comments in some chapters of this
grammar. I also thank Kasia Wojtylak for every warm word and every smile.
        In Cairns I also had the emotional and pharmacological-caffeinated support
and friendship of Nick Piper, whose mere voice and presence was already a
motivation for happiness, not to mention our shared embarrassing TV preferences.
        Natacha Chevrier, for sharing the endless cold nights in Leiden, and always
offering an alternative in case of the apocalypse: ‘an incomplete grammar of Kakua’.
        I also thank the academic panel who revised this grammar for their insights
and stimulating comments.
        En Colombia, a mis amigos que me llenaban de fuerza silenciosa para seguir
trabajando. Saber que regresaba a verlos siempre era un aliciente para los días de
desespero y de ausencias. Federico Viadero, Daniel Castro, Mauricio Concha, Sharay
Cruz, Camilia Gómez Cotta, Madelaynne Montaño, Claudia Andrade, Pilar Blanco.
        Finalmente gracias a mi familia. A mis hermanos Soraya y Vladimir, por el
amor que es lo que hace hermosa la vida. A mis padres, de quienes lo recibí todo, y
que vivieron con fuerza las alegrías de esta aventura Kakua, y me ayudaron a llevar
el peso de las angustias y frustraciones. Solo ustedes saben lo que pasa más allá del
corazón y la mente, cuando la fuerza no es suficiente. Este trabajo es solo parte del
reflejo del inmenso amor, porque sin ese amor, confianza y cuidado, no podría haber
tomado el primer paso.

                    Introduction: Kakua and its speakers
1.0    Introduction
        Kakua is an Amazonian language spoken in the linguistic area of the Vaupés,
in Northwest Amazonia, eastern Colombia (the Ethnologue/ISO 639-3 code for
Kakua is cbv; the WALS code is cac).
        The language is a member of the small Kakua-Nɨkak language family.1 Its
speakers live in inland forest settlements. Two main settlements are home to most of
Kakua’s approximately 250 speakers. The largest of these two settlements is
Wacará2, with 183 individuals.3 Wacará is located between the Vaupés and the
Querarí Rivers in Colombian territory approximately 100 kilometers to the east of
Mitú, near the Brazilian border (see Map 1 below).
        The second bigger Kakua settlement is Nuevo Pueblo, which is an inland
forest village between the Vaupés and the Papurí rivers. The number of inhabitants
of this village is approximately 40 ~ 45 individuals.
        About 10-15 other speakers of Kakua live scattered either in villages inhabited
by speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages (a neighboring language family), or on
their own in remote interfluvial settlements.
        The present work undertakes a grammatical description of the Kakua
language. The description is based mainly on dialects spoken in the Kakua village
of Wacará. Kakua is divided into two main dialect areas (see §1.6 below), in each of
these areas, there are some clan-specific varieties.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"
10.6.3 Second-hand evidentiality
        The categories of visual (unmarked) and nonvisual, described above, can be
described as firsthand evidential categories. Additionally, Kakua has two other
categories which indicate that the proposition was not directly experienced by the
speaker. These two categories of ‘second-hand’ evidence express inferences and
reported evidence. Each of these has specific morphemes, =ta (with its allomorph
=tagǎ) and =dê for inference (§10.6.4 below), and =wɨt for reported evidentiality
(§10.6.5 below). These two second-hand categories may co-occur with a prefix,
which indicates inferential evidentiality in general, without specifying whether or
not this inference is based on some else’s report or not, and which can be used on
its own. The co-occurrence of the second hand prefixes and reported or inferred
envidentiality clitics is not obligatory.
        This prefix has three allomorphs: t- ~ ti-, and t- ~ ta- and are all glossed as
‘EVID’. The forms t- ~ ti- co-occur with the reported evidential clitic =wɨt, and the
forms t- ~ ta- co-occur with the inferred evidential clitics =ta, =tagǎ. Both prefixing
forms ti- and ta- typically undergo a phonological reduction to t-. It is possible that
in a future stage of the language the difference between the two forms ti- and ta- will
be lost, and only the form t- will survive to encode second-hand evidentiality, where
further specification for inference or reportative will be required (as it is in
synchronic Kakua). Moreover, the difference between ti- and ta- is only rarely made
by elder speakers, and younger speakers only use the prefixed form t- for both
inference and reportative evidentiality. Thus, because of this possible future path
towards a neutralization of the prefixed forms into one single ‘second-hand’
evidentiality marker in need of further specification, I propose that these are
synchronically different markers, but will at some point merge together into one.
        Even for the elder generation that still makes the difference between ti- and
ta-, the difference seem to be made exclusively when a clitic of inference or
reportative is not present. In the remaining cases when the clitics for inference or
reportative are marked, then the prefixing forms ti- or ta- seem to be more rarely
marked fully as such, and are rather found as t-.
        A few examples are shown below. More examples of the co-occurrence of
the second-hand prefix with clitics of inference or reported evidentiality can be found
below in §10.6.4 and §10.6.5 respectively.

      ‘because he fell asleep, the jaguar ate him’ (reported information)        Prefixes in Kakua must be preceded by a proclitic (with the exception of the
reflexive/reciprocal prefix mik-, see Chapter 7). Thus, a second-hand evidential
prefix (and this applies also to the nonvisual evidential prefix described above) must
be preceded by a proclitic. If there is no person proclitic, the clause is only marked
with the relevant enclitic, as in (93) below:93) hêjʔ-kan=ta=be
    know-NEG=INF.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘(they) didn’t know’ (I infer)
10.6.4 Inferred evidentiality
        Encoding inferences in Kakua requires at least one morphological marker. As
described above, Kakua has a prefix form, t- or ta-, which expresses second-hand
evidentiality in general. Additionally, the encliticized forms of these evidentiality
markers further specify inference in a more narrow sense, and often co-occur with
the second-hand evidential prefix.
        The forms of these enclitics are: =ta ~ =tagǎ, and =dê. These forms always
encode inferred evidentiality, but they are used in combination with different tenses.
Unlike the forms =ta and =tagǎ, the form =dê does not co-occur with the second
hand prefix t- ~ ta- (described in §10.6.3 above). The clitic =dê encodes an inference
made regarding a situation at a future moment. It is glossed here as a future inferred
evidential ‘FUT.INF.EVID’. The inference expressed with =dê is based on tangible
evidence or evidence that can be corroborated that a certain situation is likely to
occur. Note in example (97) below that the enclitic for future inference = dê does
not necessarily need to co-occur with the future suffix -bip ‘FUT’. Therefore, the
future inference enclitic =dê could also be analyzed as expressing both evidentiality
and future tense.15         15
           It is possible that the form of this future inferred evidential has some relation to the basic form
(de-) of interrogative pronouns and questions words (e.g., dedě ‘what’, dêdʔ ‘which’, dêʔe ‘who’, see
Chapter 7, §7.2), although the semantic connection between interrogatives and inference remains unclear.

    ‘I’ll leave (tomorrow) (most possibly if it doesn’t rain)’95) wã=beh-min=dê=ka
    1SG=go-IMM.FUT=FUT.INF.EVID=ASS
    ‘I’ll leave (soon, most possibly, depending if circumstances are well)’       Using any other of the inferred evidential clitics in future tenses is not
admissible. The same construction in (96), for example, will not be possible to
express using the inferred evidential =tagǎ as illustrated by the inacceptable
sentence below:96) *wã=beh-min=tagǎ
    1SG=go-IMM.FUT=INF.EVID
    Intended meaning ‘I’ll leave (soon, most possibly)’       The future inferred evidential can attach to parts of speech other than verbs.
An example of the future inferred clitic attached to an interrogative pronoun is given
below:97) deděʔ=dê=tigá                        kãk=na=ka
    WHAT=FUT.INF.EVID=EMPH                 person=DECL=ASS
    ‘will it probably be a person indeed?’        For tenses other than the future, the basic form of the inferred evidential is
the clitic =ta. If the inference refers to a situation occurring in the remote past, then
=ta immediately precedes the remote past marker =hĩ, as in (98). If the situation
occurred in the recent past, then =ta immediately precedes the recent past clitic
=be, as in (99):98) mandú-wã              ʔĩ=t-hɨm-ɨp=ta=hĩ

      ‘Manuel and those with Manuel, they were there (I infer)’99) beh-nit=hĩ           kět     ʔĩ=t-hěmɁ-ep=ta=be
    go=SUBR=REM.PST 3PL            3PL=EVID-eat-PST=INF.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘after having gone, they ate’ (I infer from food leftovers)        Making inferences referring to a present situation, the form of the inferred
clitic is =tagǎ. It is possible that this form comes from a fusion of the inferred
evidential =ta (shown above), and the marker of assertion=ka, which by some
                                          Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality     301phonetic processes became [ga], acquired tone, resulting in the form that is now
invariably =tagǎ (never =taka). Note that the marker of assertion=ka does not co-
occur with the inferred evidential marker =ta. To the question of where his father
was at the moment of speech, the speaker replied as follows:100) mâwa=tagǎ
     kill=INF.EVID
     ‘(he) is killing’ (I infer, that is why he is not here)        The use of the form =tagǎ is not restricted to situations in present time. A
good number of examples in the corpus involves the co-occurrence of the form
=tagǎ and the general past suffix -Vp. In these cases, however, the form =tagǎ
never occurs together with either the recent past or remote past clitics (if these tense
clitics were to occur, the form preceding them would always be =ta and never
=tagǎ). This is illustrated in the following example:101) nin-paʔ-ka                      ʔĩ=t-nih-ip=tagǎ
     this-be.like.this=ASS           3PL=EVID-say-PST=INF.EVID     hunhãtiʔ=heʔ

     ‘like this they said, long ago’ (inferred).","[319, 320, 321, 322]"
"       III.       Comparative note
        The quality of nasality or orality as a suprasegmental property is found to be
a phonological feature widely spread among Eastern Tukanoan languages,
suggesting that prosodic nasalization in Kakua responds to a Vaupés areal feature.
        A phonological sketch of Kakua’s sister language, Nɨkak, proposes
nasalization as a prosodic feature in Nɨkak (see Cabrera et al. 1999). Presumibly,
Nɨkak speakers previously inhabited the Vaupés area before heading west to their
current territory. The fact that Nɨkak also has prosodic nasalization presents two
interesting questions to be pursued: First, it would be interesting to look at the
possibility that suprasegmental level nasalization was already present in proto
Kakua-Nɨkak. A second possibility, is to consider whether or not the suprasegmental
nasalization feature found in both Kakua and Nɨkak could have been motivated by
areal diffusion, introduced through contact with the Eastern Tukanoan languages
before Nɨkak migrated outside the area onto the west. Eastern Tukanoan languages,
is worth noting, have been described as having nasalization as a suprasegmental
property. An inverse alternative is also possible. Where Kakua-Nɨkak passed on the
70     A Grammar of Kakuasuprasegmental nasalization phenomena to the languages that arrived into the area
after Kakua-Nɨkak have already been settled ther.
        Unlike Eastern Tukanoan languages, Kakua does not present spreading of
nasalization into units beyond the morpheme to which it is specified. From a
comparative perspective, this represents a significant difference with the nasalization
pattern found in the Tukanoan languages spoken in the Vaupés.
        It could also be the case that suprasegmental nasalization in Kakua and Nɨkak
was already in place in the proto language before their contact with Tukanoan
languages. However, the fact that nasalization in these languages is so similar to
what is found in many other of the Vaupés languages, makes it highly likely that this
phonological feature responds to an areal pattern. If so, it would also be very
interesting to determine whether prosodic nasalization affected Kakua and Nɨkak
before their splitting or independently after the splitting.
        Finally, Epps (2005:76-77) discusses the possibility that prosodic nasalization
has developed in Hup through contact with Tukano, given the absence of nasalization
as a suprasegmental feature in Dâw and Nadëb (Hup’s sister languages spoken
outside of the Vaupés area and in little contact with Tukano).","[91, 92]"

10.5.3 Assertion mood =ka ~ =kɨ
        The clitic =ka expresses assertion by the speaker. By using this clitic, the
speaker expresses her attitude towards the situation, in a sense that it is the speaker
herself who takes responsibility for stating the situation.
        This enclitic of assertion has two forms =ka and =kɨ. Kakua speakers of
Nuevo Pueblo use the form =kɨ exclusively. Kakua speakers of Wacará, on the other
hand, use both =ka and =kɨ. The form=ka is used as the general assertion marker.
The form =kɨ appears to have a deictic meaning as well, indicating a spatial distance
between the speaker and the hearer. Thus, the difference between the example from
a text in (74) and the elicited example in (75) is that in (74) the speaker is in close
spatial proximity to the hearer, while in (75) the speaker is presumably speaking
from a distant point. The deictic distinction is not commonly marked, and because
of this I describe the form =ka as the ‘default’ form of the assertion marker.74) wěm=ka kǎn=diʔ                wã=mâw-bip

pronouns (74) above, demonstratives (76), nominalized or adjectivized verbs (77),
NPs (78)-(79), and predicates (as in (80)-(82), which represent the most common
hosts of the assertion marker).76) nin=bǔ=ka                                 ʔã=hépaʔ-bip=na=ka

    ‘I don’t remember’        The marker of assertion, as seen in example (76) above, can occur in
situations anchored in a future tense. In these cases, the assertion marker is
acceptable if the future situation is likely to take place, given that the assertion
marker encodes a situation to which the speaker is committed.
        The assertion marker can also co-occur in situations that are further specified
for evidentiality, specifically with the reported evidential marker (§10.6.6). In
                                         Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality      293principle, the assertion marker does not occur with the past and present forms of the
inferred evidentiality marker (see §10.6.5 below), this might have to do with the fact
that inferring that a situation has occurred (inferred evidentiality), doesn’t represent
the confidence needed for the speaker to commit an assertion towards the situation.
An alternative analysis for the assertion marker possibly having fused with the
inferred evidential marker is presented §10.6.5 below (although an inference in the
future tense can be marked with the assertion marker).","[312, 313, 314]"

12.7    Basic locative constructions
      A basic locative construction (or BLC), as defined in Levinson and Wilkins
(2006:15), is a type of construction that predominantly “occurs in response to a
Where-question”. There are two different options for expressing locative relations in
324     A Grammar of KakuaKakua. One is by means of the locative clitic =bǔ,1 the other by means of positional
verbs (of which Kakua has an extensive set). This section describes these two types
of basic locative construction. Further information on the locative marker =bǔ and
its functions is found in Chapter 6 on grammatical relations and case marking.
Chapter 8 provides more information on the semantics of positional verbs in the
context of the description of Kakua verbs.
        The locative marker =bǔ serves to express a variety of locative meanings,
among them allative ‘to/into’ and ablative ‘from’. Positional verbs cover inessive
‘in’, and adessive ‘on’ locative meanings. Examples (40)-(45) below illustrate the
stative locative, and the allative and ablative locative meanings expressed by the
locative clitic =bǔ :240) nun=bǔ               ʔã=wǎw                       hɨm-lah=na

maybe the morpheme analyzed as object marker in this book might have some other functions (marking
adjuncts as well as object arguments, for example). See the discussion on this topic in Chapter 6.

noun of the locative NP. The locative-marked NP tends to occur in initial position

2.2    Syllable structure
2.2.0 General description: syllable
        The preferred syllable structure in Kakua is CVC. Most of Kakua’s
morphemes are monosyllabic (84% of the word list used for this work). Syllables
without an onset occur only in V-initial affixes.
        Though at a lower rate, open syllables (CV) are also encountered. In word-
final position, however, these open syllables undergo phonetic vowel lengthening,
forming heavy syllables [CV:].
        The process of phonetic vowel lengthening, together with Kakua’s preferred
CVC syllabic structure, seeks to produce heavy syllables as the ideal prototype of
syllabic structure (as the hierarchy below shows).
        The syllabic weight can be understood in terms of a continuum favoring CVC
syllables, and whenever an open syllable cannot be avoided, then phonetic vowel
lengthening provides extra weight to the surface structure. Virtually, this continuum
will gradually become flexible in order to include less preferred structures until
finally reaching the less heavy syllabic structure:         CVC > CV: > CV > VC > V
         /CVC/                     includes: content word roots, affixes, clitics
         /CV/ (and [CV:]) includes: content word roots, affixes, clitics
         /VC/                      includes: V-initial affixes
         /V/                       includes affixes       In mono- and bisyllabic loans involving root-final open syllables, the CVC
structure is adopted whenever possible, demonstrating a preference for the CVC
syllabic pattern. In borrowings with open syllables, by default the glottal stop /ʔ/ is
                                                                                  Phonology 65epenthesized in the coda position of the final syllable of the word. Speakers of Kakua
speaking Spanish usually transfer the CVC pattern to Spanish:        Spanish                  Kakua
        [si]                     [tiʔ]                              ‘yes’
        [pa.pel]                 [pa.pe.laʔ]                        ‘paper’
        [me.sa]                  [me.saʔ-paʔa]                      ‘table-cl.flat’
        [ma.ɾi.na]               [ʔĩnãʔ]                          ‘Marina’ (proper name)       As noted in the examples above, in loan words the glottal stop occurs as a
default epenthetic consonant as a strategy to increase syllable weight, forming an
ideal heavy CVC syllable, whether epenthesized in onset or in coda position.
       Vowel-initial suffixes do not insert any epenthetic consonant at the
syllable/morpheme boundary even when the morpheme to which the suffix attaches
is an open-syllable morpheme: CV-VC. This shows evidence that these V-initial
suffixes do not have empty consonant slots. Some of these V-initial suffixes do have
unspecified vowel slots (e.g. past marker -Vp) in which cases the vowel in the suffix
copies the vowel quality of the root to which the suffix is bound.","[86, 87]"

13.5 Complement clauses        A complement clause is commonly defined as a clause that functions as a core
argument of the predicate of the main clause (c.f., Givón 2001:39, Dixon 2006:15-
40, Noonan 1985:46, 2007: 52). Predicates that can take a complement clause,
instead of an NP, as their argument, are commonly verbs that encode meanings of,
e.g., say, believe, wish, know, see, hear, tell (Noonan 2007). These type of predicates
                                                              Complex Clauses      359are commonly called ‘complement-taking predicates’ or ‘CTPs’ (e.g. by Noonan
2007:53).
        In Kakua, common CTPs are verbs like nih ‘say’, nǎwɁ ‘tell’, and hêjɁnahǔj
‘think/believe’ (from hêjɁ ‘know’ and hǔj ‘listen/understand’). Complement clauses
in Kakua do not take special subordinating morphology (i.e., a complementizer
particle). Syntactically, complement clauses are most typically embedded within the
main clause:30) fǐt [Iginio tew-bǔpʧew-ni=na=ka]                         fĩ=niɁ
    1PL Iginio work-have.flu-ADJVZ=DECL=ASS                    1PL=not.know    hêjɁnahǔj-kan=be
    think-NEG=REC.PST
    ‘we didn’t think [that Iginio was sick]’ (with dengue)       Although the complement clause tends to be embedded within the main
clause, alternative orders can also be found. Consider example (31), referring to a
child who is in her crawling stage, perhaps about to walk. In (31) the complement
clause occurs following the main clause. The alternative order in (32) is also accepted
by speakers.31) kǎnɁ mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
    3SG.F 3SG.F=say-think=DECL    [ʧejbit                mi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]
    tomorrow               3SG.F=walk-know-FUT=DECL=ASS
    ‘she says that she thinks [that she will know how to walk tomorrow]’32) [ʧejbit  mi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]                           kǎnɁ
    tomorrow 3SG.F=walk-know-FUT=DECL=ASS                      3SG.F    mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
    3SG.F=say-think=DECL
    ‘she says that she thinks [that she will know how to walk tomorrow]’       Example (33) below also shows a case in which the complement clause
follows the main clause:33) wã=hêjɁ-kan=ka              [dedpaɁ=ka          Ɂĩ=ʧãh-ãp=tagǎ]
    1SG=know-NEG=ASS              WHAT=ASS            3PL=do-PST=INF.EVID
    ‘I don’t know [what they did]’      Alternatively, the example shown above can also be analyzed as a
combination of two main clauses (e.g., ‘I don’t know, what did they do?’).
360 A Grammar of Kakua      The conditions allowing for these alternate orders have not yet been explored
and await future research.
13.6 Relative Clauses        Relative clauses are clauses that modify an NP of the main clause (c.f.,
Keenan 1985, Van Valin 2005:183-224). In Kakua, relative clauses differ from
complement clauses in that they are marked with the relativizer suffix –ni/-nit12 (here
glossed as SUBR ‘subordinator’) that attaches to the predicate of the relative clause.
The relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. 13 When the relative clause is
modifying the object argument of the main clause, the object marker may also occur
on the relative clause (e.g. (35) below). The relativized noun phrase can be the
subject, or object (as in (35)-(36) below) within the relative clause. There is no
relative pronoun in Kakua, and as the examples below show, the subordinator suffix
marks the predicate of the relative clause:34) [fin               têw-ni]              newě     Ɂã=wɨn-at
    yesterday          work-SUBR             man       3SG.M=die-NMLZ     Ɂã=beh-ep=be
     3SG.M=go-PST=REC.PST
     ‘the man [who worked yesterday] died’ (the man who worked yesterday went
     to his death)35) [ʧɨ ̂=diɁ                     hěmɁ-ni]=diɁ        ɲɨj=diɁ
    pineapple=OBJ                 eat-SUBR=OBJ         opossum=OBJ     Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be
     3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
     ‘they killed the opossum [that ate the pineapple]’        12
             Note the (near) homophony of this morpheme with other functional morphemes in Kakua: the
interrogative clitic =nit ‘INTERR’ (Chapter 8), agent nominalizer suffix -ni ‘A.NMLZ’ (Chapter 4),
collective plural -nit ‘PL’ (Chapter 4), and same subject clitic =nit ‘S.S’ (Chapter 8 and section §13.3
above). The homophony of morphemes in Kakua has been seen also for other morphemes (e.g., declarative
=na, inanimate plural number -na; emphatic =bǔ and locative =bǔ). The extent to which all of the
-ni/=nit forms might have a historic relation hasn’t been explored yet. Finally, the variants -ni ~ -nit as
complementizer suffixes seem to have free variation even within one and the same speaker. Since I did
not test for a context in which one form would be preferred over the other, a more systematic study should
be undertaken in future research on Kakua.
        13
             According to Dryer (2013), relative clauses preceding the noun are rather uncommon outside
of Asia. He also points out that typologically languages in which the relative clause precedes the noun are
also verb-final languages, which is true for Kakua.
                                                               Complex Clauses      36136) [mɨhiw ɲɨn-ni]=diɁ            mɨɁ=diɁ         Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be

    ‘they killed the agouti [whom the dog chased]37) [katerine     ɲɨj=diɁ           ʧɨ ̂=diɁ          mi=wɨɁ-ni]=diɁ

    3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
    ‘they killed [the opossum to whom Katherine had given pineapple]’        Examples (35)-(37) above raise various interesting questions. One concerns
the marking of object case on both the relative clause and the head noun. Probably
this marking on both elements is a formal distinction that, in addition to the use of
the subordinator marker -ni ~ -nit, helps to identify relatives clauses from other types
of subordinate clauses. Or maybe the marking of object case on both the relative
clause and the head noun can be interpreted as an apposition of a headless relative
clause and the noun to which it refers (headless relative + head N. See examples of
headless relative clauses below).
        Another interesting construction of relative clauses is that shown in example
(37). This is an internally headed relative clause, which illustrates yet another
strategy of relative clause formation. Kakua can thus be said to have externally
headed relative clauses, internally headed relative clauses, headless relative clauses,
and (maybe) the apposition of the relative clause and the head noun.
        Future research on these different subordinating constructions will
undoubtedly provide us with very enriching typological information of subordination
strategies in the languages of the area.
        Kakua frequently uses headless relative clauses. Thus, the subordinate clause
occurs on its own and, as other relative clauses, usually precedes the predicate of the
main clause. Examples of headless relative clauses are given below. Note that
perhaps because of the lack of a head NP, in this type of headless relative clauses,
the subordinate clause seems to also be able to function as an argument of the main
clause (to function as a complement clause). Headless relative clauses are, by
definition, arguments of the main clause; thus, finding a formal difference between
headless relative and complement clauses can help to set these constructions apart in
Kakua. Possibly, a formal difference is the presence of the subordinator particle -ni
~ -nit ‘SUBR’. This formal distinction will help to describe examples like the ones in
(39)-(41) below, but does not account for the headless relative in (38) which lacks
the subordinator suffix. A rigorous evaluation of the different types of subordinate
clauses and their strict formal distinctions awaits further research:

have not provided a description of arguments that may or may not be relativized

other within the relative clause).

        5 This is a distinct group from the Bará people, speakers of an Eastern Tukanoan language of the
Vaupés, spoken in the Pirá-Paraná region. The etymology of this ethnonym is not clear
4     A Grammar of Kakua        The Kakua people have been locally referred to as Makú de Cubeo, Makú de
Desano, or Makú de Wanano, or generally as ‘Makú’. In the literature, they have
also been referenced as Bará (Silverwood-Cope, 1972) and as Cacua.
        The term ‘Makú’ has been used by the River people in the Vaupés region to
refer to any forest-dwelling group of people, or people from the forest in general,
regardless of their ethnicity or language (c.f., Jackson 1983:149, and other
discussions found in Ospina 2002 for Yuhup, and Epps 2008 for Hup. See also V.
Martins 2005 on reference to the ‘eastern Makú’ branch, and Mahecha et al. 1996-
97 on additional discussion of the term Makú. Epps & Bolaños submitted, offer also
discussion of the term Makú used as a linguistic classification to group many
unrelated forest-dweller peoples). The term Makú in itself has a very strong
pejorative connotation, and is even used as an insult among peoples in the region.
The term probably has an Arawak origin with the meaning of ‘those who do not talk’
or ‘do not speak’ (e.g. Arawak Baniwa-Curripaco ma-aku ‘NEG-speak’; see Koch-
Grünberg 1906:877; see also discussions in Martins & Martins 1999: 251, Ramirez
2001a:198, Epps & Bolaños submitted. See also Ospina 2002:16 for alternative
suggestions on the origin of the ‘Makú’ term).
        As opposed to the ‘forest people’, the ‘river people’ live along the main rivers
or main streams and cultivate large agricultural fields (compared to that of the
Makú’s). Their protein sources are obtained primarily from fishing, and this has
made them experienced river navigators able to face the wild rapids of the Vaupés
River.
        Forest people, in turn, are expert navigators of the land. They are perceived
as quick and silent in the forest and able to face long nights walking and sleeping in
the forest without being noticed by the river peoples. Their experience with water,
however, is less developed and constantly invites mockery from the river peoples.
        Forest people are both feared and looked down upon by River peoples.
Because they are considered to be socially inferior, they are hardly considered worth
referring to. However, because of their astuteness when dealing with the inhospitable
forest, the same river people who look at them with pity, fear them as well.
        Because the Kakua people have relied strongly on hunting and gathering for
their subsistence they are also called ‘Makú’ (as mentioned, the term ‘Makú’ is
applied to all the hunting-gathering forest peoples of the region). Different from most
of their neighbors, peoples from Eastern Tukanoan and Arawak speaking groups, the
Kakua peoples have a highly mobile lifestyle, engaging in long trekking, and hunting
trips that can last from one day to many months. Additionally, family groups often
organize trips to visit other family members either to the village of Nuevo Pueblo,
or to inland places where they spend time together, hunting and gathering forest
goods. These trips may last a few months, or even years.
        The connotations of the term ‘Makú’ is thus negative now and as far as we
know has always been so. In the broader social context of Colombia, being
indigenous is synonymous to being an inferior person, poor and naïve. Calling
someone an Indian in the urban context has very negative overtones. When
indigenous peoples in the Colombian Vaupés become aware of the social
embarrassment entailed in being indigenous, they claim not to be so, replying often
                                                   Introduction: Kakua and its speakers                5that the ‘Makú’ people are the real Indians, and not them (“indio yo? no, indios los
Makú, yo no!”).
        I have also witnessed a fight among children in an Eastern Tukanoan village
of Desanos, where the ultimate insult culminating the fight was when one of the
children involved called the other one ‘Makú’, reinforcing his insult saying “you are
just like those Kakua savages!”
        Likewise, in many of my trips to the area, whenever I have told people that I
frequently visit the Kakua people, I am questioned with high astonishment: why do
I want to visit forest people? and what is really so interesting about them? The
implication is as if they were almost animal-like creatures.
        When I first visited the Kakua village of Nuevo Pueblo, I was greeted by the
Kakua in the Desano language.6 When I replied back speaking in Kakua people
looked at me with disbelief and insisted a few more times in Desano. Once it was
clear to them that I could not understand a word of Desano, the first person
addressing me stepped back and with a look of unpleasant surprise on her face she
asked again, this time in Kakua, “are you really understanding our language? Can
you really not understand the language of the patrons?”. This seems to have been a
big disappointment not only for the Kakua people, but for the Desano people as well.
Many times during my stays in Nuevo Pueblo I was addressed in Desano, and people
seemed not to be able to get over the fact that I could not speak Desano but was
trying to make my way into Kakua.
        Finally, from my own observations in the Tukano village of Piracuara at the
basin of the Papurí River, the Hup people –also considered Makú, and with whom
the Kakua people of Nuevo Pueblo have social relationships and even some cases of
intermarriage– represent the more numerous population in the village. Nonetheless,
the Tukanoans maintain control and make primary decisions in this village. At the
local school, children are given meals twice daily during the school program. The
Hup children will only eat after the Tukanoan children have already eaten and been
served. This serves as a good illustration of the lower class position of the ‘Makú’
people vis à vis their regional neighbors.
        These experiences are not very different from what has been documented in
the ethnographic literature of the peoples of the area. For example, Jackson
(1983:159) mentions specific cases when the ‘Makú’ are referred to as animal-like
creatures.
        The ‘Makú’ people overall are considered to have a socially inferior status,
and their socio-economic relationship with the other indigenous groups of the area
(Eastern Tukanoans and Arawak groups) is clearly unbalanced.","[25, 26, 27]"

are not considered here, but will need further study. Another factor favouring the
overt marking of object case appears to be word order, where OSV order tends to
favour the overt marking of case on the object argument (see Chapter 11, §11.1).
        The criteria conditioning DOM presented here for Kakua should be further
investigated in future research, and many questions remain unanswered for this
version of the description on the grammar of Kakua. Issues regarding topicality, for
example, and the interaction between definiteness and specificity, call for a detailed
study.
        This section is subdivided as follows: animacy and DOM in Kakua are
presented in §6.3.1-§6.3.6 while section §6.3.7 describes DOM and definiteness.
Other discourse related criteria that favours the overt marking of object case in
Kakua (namely definiteness) is given in §6.3.7 below. Future research should be

192         A Grammar of Kakuafollowed in order to establish other possible correlations between DOM and other
areas of the grammar6.1.1       DOM and animacy
       The oligatoriness of object marker in Kakua responds to the animacy of the
noun phrase in object function. Object marking is obligatory on all noun phrases
with human referents. On other object noun phrases, object marking is obligatory if
the object noun phrase is higher on the animacy hierarchy than the subject noun
phrase. Otherwise, the overt marking of object case is optional, and may be favored
by definiteness.
       Object marking and its conditioning by animacy is a relatively common cross-
linguistic phenomenon and in fact seems to have been the most widely explored
conditioning feature for differential object marking across languages, c.f., Comrie
(1989) for references in a broader typological view of DOM; Bossong (1980, 1991,
1998) for Romance, Turkic, some Indo-European languages, and languages of
Australia; Blake (2001) for some aspects of DOM in Hindi; England (1996) for
Mayan languages; for languages of the Vaupés see Aikhenvald (2003, 2012); Zúñiga
(2007), and Epps (2008); Comrie (2008) makes reference to alignment of case
marking in a typological perspective; Campbell & Grondona (2012) for languages
of the Chaco and the southern cone; and O’Connor & Muysken (2014) and Birchall
(2014) for an overview of languages of South America.
       From these studies, we know that the higher the animacy of the object noun
within the hierarchy, the more likely it is that its marking will be obligatory. The
hierarchy governing this is reproduced below from Silverstein 1976 (see also Comrie
1989, and Croft 1991 for more discussion on animacy hierarchies):4                            1 > 2 > 3 > Human > Animate > Inanimate      The rationale behind this is that entities lower on the animacy hierarchy are
very likely to be patients and thus objects therefore do not need to be overtly marked
as such. For instance, nouns referring to human entities are typically agents, whereas
inanimate nouns are typically patients. This disambiguates between agents and
patients in many cases. However, ambiguity can occur when two (or more)
arguments within a clause have potentially the same animacy and thus the possibility
to be agents, e.g. when the object argument has a human referent. This is the reason
why nouns referring to humans when functioning as the object(s) argument(s) of the
clause are obligatorily marked, also in Kakua.
        DOM in Kakua conforms to this animacy hierarchy. All noun phrases with
human referents, including pronouns and demonstratives with human referents, are
obligatorily marked when in object function (demonstratives are obligatorily marked
also for a different reason, namely because they are definite, a pragmatic criterion
that favours the overt marking of object case; see §6.3.7 below). Nouns referring to        4
            Comrie (1989) notes also that pronouns do not really relate to animacy, but to referentiality.
                                         Argument marking and case marking 193a particular small set of animals are also very often (although not obligatorily)
marked, and this is determined by the animacy associated with them in Kakua’s
cultural and mythological conception. Most other animal terms and animate entities
in general are far less often marked (optionally marked). All inanimate terms are
also optionally marked (and may be marked depending on definiteness, topicality, or
disambiguation from other inanimate argument within the clause, see the description
in §6.3.7 below).
       Kakua thus has a cut-off point between obligatory and optional object
marking on the animacy scale between humans and mythological beings, on one side
(including PNs with reference to these), and other animates, and inanimates on the
other side, as summarized in the following figure.","[213, 214, 215]"

the exception of onomatopoeic words and loans). Considering the morpheme as the
domain of tone accurately accounts for the occurrence of the three contrastive tones
in both mono- and bisyllabic morphemes. Figure 2.18 illustrates the root as the tonal
domain accounting for mono- and bisyllabic roots:Figure 2.19: Root as the tone domain.

morphemes would be assigned tone in an ambiguous fashion. Compare Figure 2.18        19 A previous version of the phonology of Kakua (Bolaños M.A thesis in 2010) proposed that
the root was the domain of tone.

restrict for the occurrence of sequences of tone contrasts within the same root. Such
sequences, in fact, do not usually occur in the language (see exceptional cases at the
end of this section. See also an alternative analysis of tone and its interaction with
stress-accent in footnote 17 above and §2.3.3 below):Figure 2.21: Sequences of tonal contrasts within the same root

Tone       Tone (e.g HL-HL)       If the domain of tone were to be considered the mora, this would also create
ambiguous representations of tone. If, for example, every segment of a morpheme
has a mora (for example, if a voiced consonant has moraic weight, and a morpheme
consists of C+voiceVC+voice) this means that tone could virtually dock to every mora
Furthermore, no unambiguous prediction could be made regarding the mora to which
the tone values should be assigned. Thus, any of the structures in Figure 2.22 below
would be possible domains of tone: 20         20 An alternative analysis is to consider the morpheme as the domain of tone phonologically (as
it is presented here), but that phonetically smaller units can provide the locus for tones also to associate.
This needs to be resolved in future studies of the phonology of Kakua.

        Considering the morpheme as the domain for tone makes a correct prediction:
if monosyllabic morphemes do not allow for more than one tone or tone sequences,
then it makes sense to propose that bisyllabic morphemes do not allow for more than
one tone either. Moreover, this analysis elegantly accounts for the surface realization
of contour melodies in bisyllabic and monosyllabic morphemes (but see footnote 17
on an alternative analysis as a word-accent system). An illustration of the behavior
of Kakua’s phonological tone distinctions is given in the subsections below.","[96, 97, 98]"

with the inferred evidential marker =ta in either remote or recent past tenses.

10.6.5 Reported evidentiality
       Kakua marks reported information with the enclitic =wɨt, glossed ‘REP.EVID’.
This reported enclitic has a clear etymological source in the Kakua verb wɨt
‘command’ (see comments on this at the end of Chapter 8). This clitic is also used
when quoting someone or in narratives such as mythological stories which are
regarded as events that did occur but were experienced by people who told them to
someone else. It is also used when the original source of the information is unknown,
or unavailable, but nevertheless the information is not regarded as imaginary.109) manji                  tɨ ̃̂b-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ

10.6.6 Getting the right evidential marker
        It is noteworthy that there is a strong awareness among Kakua speakers about
using the ‘correct’ evidential marking for each situation. The following episode that
occurred during my fieldwork illustrates how important evidential marking is in
Kakua speech. The following example comes from a conversation after watching a
documentary movie about the Nɨkak. Here the speaker is telling what he saw the
night before in the movie. Since this was a movie, choosing the correct evidential
marker is non-trivial, especially because the speaker himself had seen the Nɨkak
people before when they were brought to the Kakua village in the late 1980s. Thus,
he appears to have regarded the images in the movie as projections of situations in
the real world. However, a movie, or a photographic image, is not regarded as a
direct visual experience, but as information experienced through some other sensorial
means. The speaker hesitated on what evidential marker he should use, and, as seen
in the example below, he repeats the same predicate ( ʔĩ-t=jǎk-bâbʔ-bâbʔ=hĩ
3PL=EVID-cook-drink-drink=REM.PST ‘they cooked and drank’) various times until
he finally decides that expressing the proposition as visually experienced, without
any formal marking, is the most accurate way to tell his version of the story. The
text continued with the speaker only using the visual (unmarked) form.

"6.3.7 DOM and definiteness
        Another typologically common condition on DOM is the definiteness of the
object argument (c.f., Comrie 1989; Iemmolo 2011), and the related notion of
specificity. By definiteness, I mean that the speaker assumes that the hearer can
identify the referent, by indefinite reference that he/she does not. Indefinite reference
can be further divided into specific reference and nonspecific reference. In the case
of specific reference the referent that cannot be identified by the speaker is known
to the speaker, in the case of nonspecific reference the referent is not known to the
speaker. A hierarchy for increasing likelihood of overt object marking relative to
definiteness and specificity is proposed by Croft (2003: 132) (see also Givón 1984:
387):
                               definite < specific < nonspecific
204       A Grammar of Kakua        Note that obligatoriness of object marking in Kakua is determined by animacy
(and whether it is a pronoun). In Kakua, the definiteness of a noun phrase increases
the likelihood that object case markers are used, but case marking on definite noun
phrases is still optional, as examples (47)-(49), among others, show. The following
example illustrates object marking on a definite noun phrase, where it is optional
according to animacy.63) hiw-wã        tɨh=diʔ            hěmʔ=nit=diʔ

      ‘he heard when the jaguars were eating the turtle’ (the one that the man had left
      behind)         Example (64) below, illustrates the case where the argument hiw ‘jaguar’ has
no case marker, showing that in terms of animacy, it is optionally marked. The fact
that it is not definite, adds to the likelihood that it is not marked in this example.64) hiw            nin-pâʔ           hiw      paʔ̃̂ -ɲɨʔ       nin-pâʔ

      ‘a jaguar like this, on this side a jaguar was standing across, I found a jaguar
      standing across (the path)’       Inanimate nouns are also more likely to be marked when definite, as in the
following examples (definite: (65) vs. indefinite: (66)). Note also that Kakua does
not have dedicated definite articles, and that having a pronoun preceding the noun
serves as definiteness marking:       ̃̌

thus often marked for object case when in object argument function. Examples are

5.2    Noun classification and classifiers
5.2.1 Amazonian nominal classification systems
        Noun classes and classifiers are recognized as two separate phenomena in the
typology of nominal classification systems. Noun class systems are characterized as
systems with a small set of typically bound morphemes that are used for agreement
marking on various elements in a clause (Dixon 1986; Grinevald [Craig] 1986,
2000). Classifiers, on the other hand, are (usually free) forms that are not used as
agreement markers and that display a large set of members (cf. Allan 1977; Senft
2000, 2007; Croft 1994).
        Grinevald & Seifart (2004, see also Seifart & Payne 2007, Seifart 2007,
Seifart 2010a) argue that a strict division between noun classes and classifier systems
makes it difficult to account for the properties of nominal classification systems in
Amazonian languages.
        Instead, Grinevald & Seifart (2004) suggest that both defining properties
formerly given to the two separate systems (noun class vs. classifiers) converge in
one and the same system in some Amazonian languages. Seifart & Payne (2007:385)
suggest that possibly these nominal classification systems developed via
grammaticalization from nouns into both classifiers and agreement markers, given
that these systems display both agreement and boundedness.
        Nominal classification in Kakua shares characteristics of Amazonian systems
identified by Seifart & Payne (2007) as typical for Northwest Amazonia, namely
properties typical of a noun class system (bound suffixes, some marginal
anaphoric/agreement functions), as well as properties typical of a classifier system
(large set of forms with derivational functions specifying shape, texture or gender).
For the sake of a consistent terminology, though recognizing that the classification
of nouns in Kakua converge defining properties of noun classes and classifiers, in
this chapter I refer to the nominal classification system in Kakua as “classifiers” and
gloss them throughout as ‘CL’.
        The following sections provide a definition of classifiers in Kakua and the set
of thus identified classifiers (§5.2.2), a discussion of the derivational use of classifiers
148     A Grammar of Kakuaand similarities between classifier constructions and noun compounding (§5.2.3), and
the anaphoric use of classifiers (§5.2.4.)
5.2.2 Kakua classifiers as a subclass of nouns
        Morphosyntactically, classifiers in Kakua are a subclass of nouns. Like nouns,
they can often stand on their own (see for example (11) below). However, they are
identified here as a separate subset of nouns because, unlike regular nouns, they have
particular functions, semantic profiles, and forms that sets them apart from the rest
of nouns. These are listed below:
        i)       Functions: the subclass of nouns identified as classifiers, has two
                 main functions:
                    a) Derivation (§5.2.4)
                    b) Anaphoric reference (§5.2.5)
        ii)      Semantic profile: semantically, this subclass of nouns has a
                 distinctive profile, which can be divided into three groups: gender
                 specification (§5.2.6), shape (§5.2.7), and texture (§5.2.8).
        iii)     Form: often these classifier nouns have forms that are shorter than
                 lexical nouns, or seem to be a reduced form of a noun or verb. In
                 addition, unlike the rest of the majority of nouns, some of the
                 classifiers appear to be toneless. 1 When not bound, the set of noun
                 classifiers can function either for anaphoric reference to an NP or as
                 a modifier of an NP.
        Note that in combination with other nouns, classifiers are represented as
bound forms in the transcriptions. They are referred to as “suffixed” elements
whenever they occur attached to a preceding noun. The reason to identify them as
“attached” elements, rather than juxtaposed nouns, is that when classifiers occur
attached to a preceding noun, they form one single phonological word with that noun.
Note that a classifier can also attach to a complex noun stem, after, e.g. plural
suffixes, and not directly to the noun root.
        Another motivation to call this subclass of nouns classifiers is because of their
typical use and semantics, which are overall very similar to classifier systems
described for surrounding languages in the Vaupés area and beyond.
        It is difficult to draw a line between constructions involving classifiers
attached to nouns versus compounds consisting of two nouns. This point can be
particularly well illustrated with terms referring to parts of plants, where there is not
        1
            Phonetically, the forms which appear to be toneless, adapt to the melody of the morpheme to
which they attach. For example, if they are attached to a morpheme with a falling tone, then the classifier
will be pronounced with a low tone by copying the last portion of the falling tone contour from the
preceding morpheme. When no tone precedes it (e.g., when attached to other toneless noun morphology
like plural marking, or when standing on their own), these toneless classifiers are pronounced with a low
tone.
                       Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 149a clear distinction between analyzing this type of construction as N-classifier
constructions or as N-N compounding. The analysis can go either way. This is
illustrated in the following examples, where what is glossed as classifiers may as
well be analyzed as nouns in compounds:10) a.      mâ-nat                      ‘root’ (tree-CL:root)
    b.      mɨ ̀-naʔ-daʔ                 ‘peach-palm fruit’(tree-CLːtree-CL:round)
    c.      wɨbʔ-kãw                    ‘stalk of patabá palmtree’ (patabá.tree-stalk)
    d.      dâwa-nɨ ̂w-na               ‘leaves of rubber tree’ (rubber.tree-leaf-PL)
    e.      mâ-pɨh                      ‘base of tree’ (tree-base.of.tree)
    f.      mâ-kãw                     ‘stalk’ (tree-stalk)
    g.      mâ-kãʔ                     ‘branch’ (tree-branch)        When classifiers are used anaphorically, they also function
morphosyntactically like nouns, and take e.g. case markers or number marking
(showing again that they are morphosyntactically a subclass of nouns). This is
illustrated in (11) below, where the referent of the noun ʔɨ ̂ʔ-naʔ blowgun-CL:tree
‘blowgun’ in the first line of the example, is anaphorically referred back to in the
second line lacking the head noun, and instead the classifier stands on its own taking
all of the nominal morphology: naʔ=hiʔ̃́ CL:tree=COM ‘with the stick like object’:11) nɨwá           ʔã=peb-hɨm=nit=hiʔ̃́                            ʔɨ ̂ʔ-naʔ
    grandfather     3SG.M=be.together-exist=S.S=COM                  blowgun-CL:tree     ʔã=nɨm=nit             naʔ=hiʔ̃́                     webit=bǔ
     3SG.M=steal=S.S         CL:tree.like=COM              child=TOP     bûɁjup=diʔ                         mâw
     hummingbird=OBJ            kill
     ‘the children hunt hummingbirds with the blowgun the grandfather had stolen
     from his neighbours’       Example (12) below illustrates the Kakua classifier -puku ‘CL:convex’
occurring as a free form, as well as two other classifiers that occur with a possessive
prefix only, just like noun stems. This example is particularly relevant to the question
raised above, regarding the unclear distinction between classifiers or nouns in
general. E.g., the forms in example (12) can alternatively be understood as a free
nouns, rather than as classifiers:12) pukuʔ                 ʔã=daʔ-naʔ
    CL:convex            3SG.M=CL:round-CL:tree
    ‘a tree with nodes along its trunk’ (the convex one, has nodes)
150    A Grammar of Kakua5.2.3 The inventory of classifiers
        The inventory of Kakua classifiers comprises a rather small set of forms, if
compared to that found in other languages of the Vaupés linguistic area (especially
that described for Arawak Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003), which displays a long list of
classifiers for shape, function, quantification, and other meanings that Aikhenvald
(2003:87ff) calls specific classifiers. Also, Gómez-Imbert (1996) describes a large
set of shape classifiers found in Tukanoan languages, most of which have semantics
relating to the form or shape of the noun referent to which they are suffixed.
        As stated in the section above, the distinction between classifiers and regular
compounded nouns is fuzzy and the identification of classifiers is primarily based on
their common semantics and functions.
        The set of classifiers in Kakua numbers 15 suffixes for shape specifications,
2 classifiers for texture, and 2 gender classifiers (Tables 5.1 - 5.3). The first two sets
are used with inanimate referents, while the latter is exclusively used with animate
referents (there are, however, some examples where animate referents are also taking
a classifier for shape). Tables 5.1 – 5.3 also indicate the possible etymology of this
subclass of classifiers in Kakua. This information is important also because
classifiers specifying texture are clearly related to Kakua native nouns, again blurring
the distinction between noun compounding and classifier constructions. Some
classifiers specifying for shape/form have a clear etymology from Kakua nouns or
verb roots, and some others are very likely borrowed from Arawak or Tukanoan
languages, as further discussed in sections §5.2.6 - §5.2.8.
        Note that, unlike Eastern Tukanoan languages and Arawak Tariana spoken in
the Vaupés, Kakua does not have a dedicated classifier to signal animacy of entities.
Gómez-Imbert (1996:448-449), for example, in her discussion of Tukanoan, presents
an animate/inanimate distinction in the plural, whereas in the singular animates are
marked as masculine (or non-feminine) or feminine. Kakua does not make this
animate/inanimate distinction in neither plural nor singular forms, and, as illustrated
in §5.2.6, makes a gender distinction for feminine only in restricted contexts.
Additionally, Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003:87ff) is described as having a classifier to
signal animacy of entities.
        The following Tables 5.1-5.3 show a comprehensive list of all classifiers in
Kakua. Note that the possible etymologies given in these tables do not exhaustively
explore all possible etymological sources, but they nevertheless serve to show
interesting connections between Kakua classifiers and some other Amazonian
languages.

"        The definition of tense followed here to describe the different tense markers
in Kakua is that given in Comrie (1985:9ff), where tense refers to the “expression
of location in time” through grammatical means. Likewise, the description of tense
specifications presented here for Kakua refers to the grammatical (or marginally
grammaticalized, in the case at least of the recent past clitic) morphemes that serve
to situate an event in time.
        Tense distinctions in Kakua texts are not obligatorily marked, especially once
the location in time of the event has already been established in the discourse. Tense
distinctions can also commonly be inferred from other distinctions regarding time or
the speaker’s attitude towards the event. This is to say, it is not uncommon in Kakua
to find aspectual or modal distinctions without any tense marking at all.
                                         Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality      26910.1.2 General past -Vp
        The suffix -Vp is here described as a ‘general past’ marker because it encodes
the semantics of a situation that occurs at a time prior to the time of speech.
Additionally, Kakua makes deictic time distinctions in past tenses, i.e. the recent past
=be (§10.1.2) and the remote past =hĩ (§10.1.3). These enclitics usually occur in
addition to the general past suffix (though not obligatorily). The general past suffix
immediately follows the verb stem, and, unlike the other markers of past distinctions,
occurs with verb stems only. The suffix itself has an unspecified vowel, where the
identity of the vowel in the past marker is copied from the vowel of the verb stem
to which it attaches. Examples of this marker combining with the recent past =be
are presented in (1)-(3) below:1) fîn          fĩ=ʔên-ep=be
   yesterday     1PL=see-PST=REC.PST
   ‘we saw it (in the movie) yesterday’2) bǐʔ          bǐʔ    ʔã=t-hɨm-ɨp=wɨt=be

   kill-PST=INF.EVID=REC.PST
   ‘(they) killed three, the woman said’       Note that this past marker cannot occur with e.g., future suffixes -bip ‘FUT’
and -min ‘IMM.FUT’, nor with adverbials indicating future reference. Neither is a
construction such as the elicited example shown in (4) below, involving present time
reference and the general past marker -Vp, accepted by speakers:4) *bɨ            fĩ=ʔên-ep=na
   today/now      1PL=see-PST=DECL
   intended meaning: ‘now we see it’        Examples of this marker combining with the remote past =hĩ are presented
in (5)-(6) below:

   ‘we went to Mitú’        Note that it can also occur without any further specification of deictic time
(i.e., without a specification for recent or remote past). Examples (7)-(9) illustrates
this (see also example (5) above):7) ʔĩʔ=kêd-at=diʔ                           haʔ̃̂ -têw-beh-ep

   wild.pig     1PL=HAB-chase-go-PST=INTS
   ‘we went chasing wild pigs, indeed’
10.1.3 Recent past =be
        The enclitic =be indicates that the event or state encoded by the predicate
occurred at a past moment no more than one year ago. This time range, however, is
not very strict, e.g. when it’s being used in relation to some other longer time period.
In most cases, the recent past enclitic (like the remote past enclitic) co-occurs with
the general past suffix –Vp (as in examples (1)-(3) above). However, sometimes the
recent past enclitic also occurs without the general past suffix, and in elicitation both
options were accepted. The rules allowing for the omission of the general past suffix
are still unclear. An example of the recent past enclitic occurring without the general
past suffix is given below. Note that the verb ʔǔʔ ‘dream’ is followed by the
declarative enclitic, and the general past is not suffixed to the verb. Although
examples of this type are not as frequent as the co-occurrence of the general past +
recent past markers, they are not rare either.10) hiwi=diʔ      wã=ʔǔʔ=na=be

freedom of host selection. Example (10) shows the attachment of the recent past
enclitic to a verb, while the examples below show its occurrence with pronouns:11) měm=nit=be                     ma=ʔɨ ̃̂b-ɨp
    2SG=INTERR=REC.PST              2SG=take.out-PST       ̃́

     granddad.VOC          be.small-ADJVZ-CL:liquid=OBJ
     ‘I took (the wasai) and gave to my daughter, granddad!’
10.1.4 Remote past =hĩ
        The enclitic =hĩ indicates that the event or state encoded by the predicate
occurs at a past time moment that is considered remote. Usually, whenever the event
or state occurred more than one year before the time of speech, the remote past
enclitic is used. The remote past enclitic is commonly used in narratives of myths of
origin, or in bedtime stories for children. But it is also used when referring to a time
in the past of a person’s life. Some examples are presented below:13) tʃɨ ̌jʔ=bɨt                 ʔĩ=t-bibuʔ-up=wɨt=hĩ

    ‘(they) slept with them in the hut’15) victor-ĩʔ           mɨ ̌=bǔ=hĩ                       fĩ=hɨm-ɨp=hĩ
    Victor-POSS          house=LOC=REM.PST                  1PL=exist-PST=REM.PST
    ‘we were at Victor’s house’       As in the case of the recent past enclitic, the remote past enclitic =hĩ occurs
in the majority of cases together with the general past suffix. However I have also
found cases in which the remote past enclitic does not co-occur with the general past
marker (although even fewer cases than recent past enclitics without general past
suffixes). Examples of this are shown below (see also (15) above):
272   A Grammar of Kakua

     IMM.DEM=DECL          bring=REM.PST
    ‘(they) brought (it) here’       As in the case with the recent past enclitic, the remote past enclitic can occur
with hosts other than the predicate. Example (19) shows the enclitic (together with
the reported evidential =wɨt) encliticized to a pronoun:19) ket=wɨt=hĩ                  wâw-hɨ ̌j=nit
    3PL=REP.EVID=REM.PST         be.first-arrive=S.S
    ‘they were the first who came’
10.1.5 Future -bip
      The suffix -bip indicates situations that are to occur in the future. As with the
distinctions of past tense, future tenses can refer to an immediate future (shown in
§10.1.5 below), or to a future that is not necessarily immediate. This last one is
encoded with the suffix -bip, and can refer to any future that is not immediate. A
few examples are presented below:20) ded=paʔ=ka                      ʔĩ=pêa-bip

        The suffix -min encodes the immediate future, and is used for events that are
about to happen. It is used quite frequently with verbs of saying and telling. However,
it is not restricted to such verbs. In elicitation, the suffix was accepted whenever
encoding an event or state that is to occur in the immediate future. When the time
reference is other than immediate future, the use of the immediate future suffix –min
‘IMM.FUT’, is not grammatical.24) wã=nawʔ-min=ka                 měm=diʔ

10.2 Aspect
10.2.0 Introduction
        Kakua has three forms that encode aspectual meanings. These forms, their
semantics, and their morphosyntactic positions are presented in Table 10.2. Note that
all three forms have different morphosyntactic positions. The habitual marker is
strictly a prefix. The telic marker is strictly a suffix, while the progressive marker
usually forms a predicate of its own, occurring either as a particle (detached) from
the predicate construction, or taking also a cross-referencing proclitic and other
verbal morphology, like any other verb. The possible etymology of the progressive
marker is discussed below.

12.4     Predicative possession constructions
       Kakua has two main strategies to express possession. Firstly, the juxtaposition
of the possessor and the possessed NPs, with the possessive marker -ǐʔ suffixed to
the possessor NP for alienable possession, and without the possessive marker for
inalienable possession (see Chapter 5). Secondly, possession can be expressed by
means of a predicative construction (i.e. predicative possession). Predicative
possessive constructions involve the stative possessive verb bibùʔ ‘have/possess’.
The constituent order in predicative possessive constructions is consistent with
Kakua’s preferred SOV order. Thus, the possessor, most often animate, precedes the
possessed NP (usually inanimate), and the verb is at the end of the construction.
Constructions using this verb are illustrated in examples (23)-(26) below:23) badʔdaʔ         telu-ʧaʔ                    bɨdǐ

    child         cold     3SG.M=have=DECL=ASS
    ‘the child has a cold’       As seen in the examples above, the predicative possessive verb ‘have’ bibùʔ
takes the common verbal morphology (e.g., subject cross-reference proclitics, tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality). The possessed NP of a predicative possessive
construction is not case marked, even when DOM criteria apply (see Chapter 6).
320    A Grammar of Kakua12.5   Comparative constructions
        The function of comparative constructions in Kakua is to assign the relative
position of two referents on a predicative scale. Comparative constructions,
according to the terminology used in Stassen (1985), involve the following elements:
the standard of comparison (the NP indicating the object that serves as the yardstick
of the comparison); the comparee (the object that is being compared); the parameter
(the property on which the comparison is based), and the index (referring to the type
of comparison). The last two, i.e. the parameter and the index, are referred to as the
scale.
        Kakua comparative constructions include those in which the scale of
comparison expresses standards referred to as being less than, more than, and equal
to the compared entity. In these types of constructions, the scale is expressed by verb
roots, without additional TAME morphology, affixes or proclitics. In these cases, the
verb root by itself indicates the scale of comparison. Examples (27)-(29) illustrate
the use of the verb tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’ not functioning as a predicate, but as a scale for
comparison. The order of constituents in comparative constructions is as follows: the
comparee precedes the standard, and the position of the scale of comparison (e.g.,
tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’) is free.27) newě=bǔ jad-wili             tʃaʔ               hap=bǔ=ka

    ‘he is uglier than a flea’       Example (30) involves the use of the verb nɨmʔ ‘be.below’ as a scale for
comparison meaning ‘be less than’. Note that in these examples, as in (27)-(29) above
and (30) below, the verb expressing the scale for comparison does not take additional
TAM affixes and its function within the clause is not that of a predicate, but of a
scale of comparison:

    ‘like this short, the younger brother was shorter (than the older ones), just like
    Chavela’        Semblative comparison, in which the standard and the comparee are
conceived to be of equal degree on a given scale, are formed by using different
particles encoding meanings such as ‘be alike’, ‘like this’, ‘and so like this’, ‘be
equal’, ‘be similar to’. Choosing one particle or another depends primarily on
whether or not the speaker can physically signal the relative dimension of the
standard of comparison, and on the physical proximity of the speaker to the standard
of comparison. For example, if the speaker points to a tree in the distance as the
yardstick for comparison of height, then the particle paniʔna ‘and so like this’ (or its
shortened allomorph panʔ) would be used. This particle is also used whenever the
standard of comparison is not visually accessible. If instead the speaker physically
touches the yardstick of comparison, or uses gestures to indicate its dimensions, then
most often the particle mɨn ‘be equal’ is used.
        Example (30) above, highlights the use of particles mɨn ‘be equal’, and paʔniʔ
‘be alike/be like this’. During the utterance of the first line in the example, the
speaker was indicating how short the younger brother is with a hand gesture, by
placing one hand below with the palm of the hand facing upwards, and the other
hand higher up with its palm facing downwards. In this case the speaker uses the
particle mɨn ‘be equal’. Then, the speaker pointed at Chavela (a young girl listening
to the conversation), expressing that ‘the younger brother’ in the tale was about her
size; for this comparison the speaker uses the particle paʔniʔ ‘be alike/be like this’.
        Additional examples of semblative comparatison are given in (31)-(33) below.
A further description of Kakua’s particles, including the ones occurring within
comparative constructions, can be found in Chapter 3.31) kun=bǔ                 mɨnʔ=tiʔ      nin

          ‘yes, he was just like grandfather’        The superlative, describing a situation in which the comparee has the highest
degree among the standards of comparison, is expressed by using the noun niʔat
‘all/everything’, as in (34), or by using an emphasizing construction, as in (35),
where the nominalized verb jǔb ‘be true’ serves to express that the referent of the
noun keh ‘fish’ is the biggest among the referents of the standard of comparison
noun bita ‘others’. These examples additionally illustrate that the noun phrase
expressing the standard can be case-marked. Maybe this indicates that the standard
is regarded as a syntactic object. There is no explanation why it is that sometimes
comparees are object marked while other times they are not (the animacy hierarchy
governing DOM does not seem to predict object marking in these cases).34) newě        niʔat=diʔ          tʃaʔ               hap=bǔ

12.6    Non-verbal predicates
        Non-verbal predicates occur in verbless clauses that are formed by the
juxtaposition of two NPs without a verb. The subject argument always occurs clause-
initially in this type of clauses. Verbless clauses are used to express equative
relations, including identity, class inclusion, and class membership. Examples in
(36)-(39) below illustrate verbless clauses:36) kǎn          fwĩʔ=wâw-daʔ
    3SG.M         1PL.POSS=head-CL:round

          1SG=pass-PST-FUT
          ‘I am going to pass to you the ancient songs, now that you are a man,’       Note that an alternative analysis of these constructions may seem to be that
the copula has been omitted, i.e. as ‘zero copula’ construction. According to the
standard definition of copula constructions (Hengeveld 1992, Pustet 2003, and
especially Stassen 1994), a ‘zero copula’ type of construction presupposes that there
is a syntactic slot that is otherwise filled by another element, or in which a copula
occurs optionally under certain grammatical criteria. The examples shown in this
subsection, however, are not considered here as copula constructions with a zero
copula, because it is not the case that in these constructions a syntactic slot remains
empty in a restricted context, while alternating with an overt copula in some other
contexts. The examples presented in this section do not have alternatives with an
overt copula.
       Additionally, the simple juxtaposition of related elements in Kakua is a very
common strategy to express many different types of relations (e.g., derivation of
nouns Chapter 5, possession Chapter 5, coordination of clauses Chapter 13). It should
not be surprising then that expressing these more ‘permanent’ states of being (as
opposed to the less permanent states of being illustrated in the examples in section
§12.2) also appeal to the juxtaposition of elements as a way to express these more
permanent states of being.","[340, 341, 342, 343, 344]"
"        2.1.5.7 Glottalized voiced obstruents
        Glottalized stops are restricted to voiced stops. Voiceless stops don’t have
voiceless glottalized counterparts. These glottalized voiced stops have a wide range
of allophonic variation depending on their position in the morpheme.
        The distribution of these glottalized voiced obstruent phonemes is very
restricted. They only occur in morpheme-final position.10 These phonemes are
phonetically realized as unreleased voiced stops, or as a sequence of [CɁ]. These
        10 A previous stage of the phonological analisis of Kakua (2010), presented the possibility of
glottalized voiced obstruents in morpheme-initial position. This analysis was discarted in the light of more
data and reassessments gathered in the subsequent years. Morpheme-initial glottalized obstruents were
not found. An interesting study to undertake would be to search for possible ‘hidden’ morpheme-initial
glottals that may leave a laryngealization effect onto the following vowel.
52     A Grammar of Kakuaglottalized obstruents do not undergo post-nasalization as opposed to their non-
glottalized counterparts.
        The glottalized voiced stops also have nasal allophones, are nasalized in nasal
contexts [NɁ] ~ [NChormoganic]. The distribution of the nasal allophones of glottalized
voiced stops reflect their distribution in oral contexts.
        Perceptually, is very difficult to perceive the voicing of morpheme-final
glottalized stops; however, when a vowel-initial suffix is added to glottalized stops
in final position, the contrast with voiceless stops becomes more salient, revealing
the underlying difference between final voiceless stops and final glottalized stops.
When a vowel initial suffix is added to a morpheme with a glottalized consonant
final root a laryngealization of the vowel in the suffix is always audible.
        At this point of my research I have not encountered these voiced glottalized
obstruents in either morpheme-initial or morpheme-medial positions. Therefore, I
will illustrate the occurrence of these consonants based on the available data.
        An alternative analysis to the series of glottalized consonants is considered at
the end of this section.","[73, 74]"

after a string of clitic positions of their host. Thus, describing them as affixes would
fail to account for the identity of the morphemes (clitics) which precede these set of
clitics which do not have freedom of host selection.
        The status of case markers as clitics vs. affixes will be discussed in some
detail here, as one example how clitics can be distinguished from affixes in Kakua.
Case markers have freedom of host selection in that they attach to nouns and
adjectives (which share some, but not all characteristics of nouns, see section 3.3.5).
On the other hand, case markers may only occur on verbs if these are in the
subordinate clause (see Chapter 12 for a description of subordinate clauses in
Kakua). Case markers also display a greater freedom of movement than affixes in
two further respects. Firstly, they can occur on only one element of the noun phrase,
rather than on each individual elements of the noun phrase (examples (4)-(8), which
can be the second (4)-(6) or the first element (7).4) mâw-bɨ ̂di-ip=wɨt=hĩ                      [nin-dê]=diʔ

examples are not common. I only have gathered a few. One such is:8) [wɨn-ni         báka=hĩ=diʔ]

      ‘el cadaver finado’)        Affixes, unlike any other type of morpheme in Kakua (this includes clitics
and all of the word classes), can have syllables without onsets (see Table 3.3 below),
or consist of just a consonant (Table 3.4). Also, only affixes can have unspecified
vowels in their underlying structure. Thus, they allow for the copying of the vowel
quality of the host to which they attach. As mentioned above, affixes do not have
freedom of host selection. A list illustrating some representative examples of suffixes
in Kakua and their hosts is given in Table 3.3 below:Table 3.3 Examples of suffixes in Kakua

encoding second hand evidentiality in its reduced form t- (see Chapter 10 for
description of evidentiality), when preceding a consonant-initial stem (prefix-CVC),
violate the phonological restriction in Kakua that disallows consonant clusters. Note
that exceptions to phonological restrictions in Kakua occur for other affixes as well
(e.g. vowel copying and the onset-less syllables mentioned above). In what follows
of this section, I present a set of three enclitics that can attach to various word classes
to express emphasis or intensity of that constituent. These forms are: = jǔb, which
serves as an intensifier to nouns, with the semantic meaning of ‘truly’, or ‘really’.
Example (9) illustrates this verb root jǔb ‘be true’, from which this intensifier
derives, occurring within a verbal construction. Example (10) shows the function of
=jǔb as an intensifier of a pronoun:9) panʔni=tiʔ           nih-ip wɨd-jǔb=na=hĩ
    and.so=INTS         say-PST swallow-be.true =EMPH=DECL=REM.PST

    fire.wood burn-finish          3SG.M=OBJ=INTS                 burn
    ‘once the fire was on, (I) burned him really’        This intensifier has freedom of host selection, and it can as well occur with
another adverb, intensifying the meaning of the adverb to which it attaches. This is
illustrated in (11) below:11) fɨ ̂b-hɨ ̌j=nit=na               kǎn=diʔ           bɨká=jǔb

102   A Grammar of Kakua        In addition to the intensifier =jǔb ‘truly’ illustrated above, Kakua narratives
are full of the intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ. Its meaning is that of an affirmation
such as ‘truly’ or ‘exactly’. This intensifier =ti can also occur with both, nouns and
verbs:12) ʔã=t-hɨw̌ ʔ=hĩ=tiʔ          pɨ                   wẽp-ep=héʔ

     ‘the grandfather Sabino, in reality was my dad’       The intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ occurs commonly in interrogative clauses,
with interrogative pronouns and question words, and in adverbial particles such as
paniʔ=tiʔ ‘and so=INTS’, tɨt=tiʔ =ma ‘then’, and with the adverbial particle
hunhã=tiʔ ‘long.ago=INTS’.14) ʔĩ=ʔêw=na         hunhã=ti,           bêʔe=nit     hun=héʔ

3.2    Open classes
3.2.0 Introduction
        Nouns and verbs conform the two open classes of words in Kakua.
        The elements of the open word classes in Kakua have, in principle, an
unlimited membership. That is to say, the open classes of words in Kakua may
include not only native words, but also readily accept borrowings, calques, and any
other type of new lexical items such as words newly formed by semantic extensions
or by the lexicalization of formerly more complex words (e.g., historical compounds
that have undergone morphological and/or phonological fusion to form one complex
lexical item).
        The main element of the members of open classes is a noun or verb root that
heads the noun or verb phrase accordingly.
        Roots can be further divided into those that can occur as free elements and
those that are obligatorily bound with inflectional or derivational morphology
(Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the different free and obligatorily bound noun roots. Verb
are described in Chapters 8 and 9).
        In this study a free morpheme is understood as an element that is
phonologically independent, i.e. it is not obligatorily bound to another free
morpheme or to other bound morphology in order to form a full word.
        A major distinction between Kakua noun and verb roots concerns the
morphology each of these requires. Kakua nouns are formed by a free root that can
occur without the need of additional morphology. Verbs, on the other hand, require
for the most part a more complex morphology.
        The main semantic, phonological, syntactic and morphological characteristics
of Kakua nouns and verbs are described in the following subsections. Subsection
§3.2.1 describes these main characteristics that define Kakua nouns. §3.2.2 deals
with the main properties that characterize verbs.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"

12.11 Imperative clauses
         Imperative clauses in Kakua are formed by reduplication of the last vowel of
the verb root of the predicate of the imperative clause. The reduplicated vowel
receives an obligatory high tone. The imperative suffix is then by default represented
as -Ṽ́ , where the quality of the vowel is the same as that of the last vowel of the
verb root. This is illustrated in examples (90)-(105):90) ɲi=tɨ ̀j-huj-ú
    2PL=be.good-listen-IMP
    ‘listen carefully!’91) hemʔ-é
    eat-IMP
    ‘eat!’
336     A Grammar of Kakua92) wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-á=buhú
    1SG=OBJ tell-IMP=DIR
    ‘tell me’5       Like all Kakua clauses, imperative clauses in Kakua are typically verb-final.
Kakua often omits the overt expression of subject NP arguments (although their overt
expression is considered acceptable by speakers, they judge them to be redundant),
for they are usually referred to by means of cross-referencing proclitics on the verb
predicate. Imperative clauses in Kakua tend to omit the subject argument of the
clause more often than other clauses (a cross-linguistic common characteristic of
imperative clauses; c.f., Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171; Aikhenvald 2010:92-97, and
Chapter 2 of the same book). The omission of the subject argument of the clause
occurs more frequently with 2SG forms than with 2PL forms; however, this omission
can be said to be facultative, since instances of the 2PL where the subject argument
is omitted can also occur when context is sufficient to allow for it. The verb root
plus the imperative marker -Ṽ́, without need of further affixes or clitics, can function
as an imperative clause by itself (also a cross-linguistically common feature of
imperative clauses Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171). If additional TAME distinctions
occur, they form a separate clause. Imperative clauses without an overt proclitic are
interpreted by default as having a second person singular subject (93)-(94). Examples
(95) and (96) illustrate imperatives with overt 2PL and 2SG proclitic pronouns
respectively:93) fwɨb-ɨ ̃́
    return-IMP
    ‘come back!’94) ɲaw-á
    run-IMP
    ‘run!’95) ɲi=nêʔ-é                    tɨ ̀j-wẽp-ni
    2PL=press-IMP                 be.good-be.strong-ADJVZ
    ‘press strongly!’96) ma=tiw-í
    2SG=shot.with.blowgun=IMP
    ‘shoot!’
         5
             This example can also be analyzed as wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-ábuhú 1SG=OBJ tell-IMP2, where ‘IMP2’,
is an imperative concerning an action for the benefit of someone else. See the description of this
construction at the end of this section.
                                   Basic clause structure and types of clauses    337       Imperatives can also be used to give commands to other than a 2 nd person
(singular or plural) participants. This is done by adding the appropriate proclitic
pronoun in the imperative construction:97) mi=Ɂên-é
    3SG.F=see=IMP
    ‘may she see!’
98) mi=têw-é
    3SG.F=work=IMP
    ‘may she work!’        Constituent order in imperative clauses is somewhat different from that in
declarative clauses. Imperative clauses do have a verb final order. But if the subject
argument is fully expressed by an NP, then the subject argument most often
immediately precedes the verb. It then follows the object rather than preceding it as
in other clauses, with an OSV order as the result. The fronting of the object argument
in an imperative clause is not an uncommon cross-linguistic feature of imperatives
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97). This ordering of imperative clauses in Kakua is
illustrated in examples (99)-(101) below:99) kan=diʔ měm          ma= fwẽh-é
    3SG=OBJ 2SG           2SG=leave-IMP
    ‘leave it!’100) bab-ni=diʔ                    měm     ma=dúk-ú
     be.white-ADJVZ=OBJ            2SG      2SG=sift-IMP
   ‘sift the manioc drink!’101) wã=pebʔ           měm       ma=ɲɨʔ-hɨwʔ-ɨ ̃́
     1SG=be.near        2SG        2SG=stand-come-IMP
     ‘you come stand by me!’       The only evidentiality marker that can occur in combination with imperative
clauses in Kakua is the reported evidential =wɨt, possibly together with the prefix
t- ‘EVID’ (prefix of second hand, nonsensorial evidentiality. See Chapter 10 on
evidentiality) to express that the order has been given by someone other than the
speaker. The use of the reported evidential marker usually serves also to attenuate
the force of the command, making it a more polite imperative. This is often used
when directing orders to elders (102)-(103). Note that the additional evidentiality
specification forms a separate clause, so cannot be directly combined with the
imperative verb:

     ‘sit down! they said’103) ma=ʔɨb-ɨ ̃́          hit-at              pînaʔ                 nih=wɨt=hĩ
     2SG=take.out-IMP grate-NMLZ              POT                    say=REP.EVID=REM.PST
     ‘take (the manioc) out for grating, it is said’        In fact, imperative clauses in Kakua lack all TAME distinctions in the clause
itself, and all of these distinctions form a separate clause. Cross-linguistically
speaking, this is not an uncommon characteristic of imperative clauses (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985).
        An additional construction expressing imperative solicits the addressee to
perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The form of this imperative is
-áʔbuhú and it is glossed here as ‘IMP2’. In constructions using this morpheme, the
subject is always a second person, and its overt expression may be omitted. See
examples (104)-(105) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’. This
form can only code a ‘beneficial’ imperative, and no other benefactive or dative like
meanings can be drawn from it.104) ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ                nih-áʔbuhú
     take=DECL=ASS=D.S               say-IMP2
     ‘(she) is recording, (you) tell her!’105) kǎn=diʔ ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
     3SGM=OBJ take.out-IMP2
     ‘take (it) out for him’       Synchronically, -áʔbuhú is considered here to be one single morpheme.
However, because of the phonological (syllabic structure, vowel harmony) structure
of Kakua words, it is likely that that -áʔbuhú is historically at least a complex form.
The etymology of this imperative is not transparent.6
         6
          It might be a lexicalized combination of a morpheme -áʔ and the directional clitic=buh ‘DIR’.
The first element could be a phonologically reduced form of the negative suffix -kan, or it might
correspond to a morpheme that is no longer used in synchronic Kakua. Note that the negative suffix
doesn’t support a semantic motivation for this ‘beneficial’ imperative. Perhaps, the source of the proposed
first element -áɁ, expressed similar semantics of performing an action on behalf of a third party.
Nonetheless, there is no evidence neither in Kakua nor in its sister language Nɨkak that allows me to
strongly claim this hypothesis. The second element of this form would be the directional clitic =buh
‘DIR’, displaying the addition of a reduplicated vowel and high tone, i.e. the regular way to form
imperatives -Ṽ́. I propose the directional clitic as the most likely source of this element in this imperative
marker because of the semantics of this clitic, which comes from a verb root meaning ‘to perform an
action from a distance’ (see note at the end of Chapter 8 regarding the fuzzy verbal-directional identity
                                            Basic clause structure and types of clauses              33912.12 Negative imperative
       Negative imperative clauses require the negative imperative suffix -kabuhú.
This is also clearly a complex morpheme, historically derived from at least two
morphemes. The first part of this morpheme can be identified as the negative suffix
marker -kan/-kap. The second part, however, is less clear, and can have at least two
interpretations. Firstly, it may relate to the directional clitic =buh ‘DIR’, or to the
emphasis function of the clitic =bǔ ‘EMPH’ (see Chapter 8), plus a reduplication of
its vowel. As for now, I have no strong evidence for either of these hypotheses, but
what is clear is that (as with the second imperative described in §12.11 above), given
Kakua’s phonological and morphological rules, this particular negative imperative
morpheme can be considered historically as a complex form.
       The negative imperative morpheme must immediately follow the verb root
(to which no affirmative imperative can be attached): (PN)=Verb-kabuhú :106) ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú
     2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER
     ‘don’t be afraid!’
of this morpheme). Thus, performing on behalf, or for the benefit of somebody else can be equated to
performing an action from a distance. Whenever the clause refers to this specific semantics of performing
an action for the benefit of somebody else, the imperative is expressed with this obscure morpheme
-áʔbuhú, thus it is considered here as one single complex morpheme. In constructions using this
morpheme, the subject argument of the clause is always in the second person, and it may be omitted. See
examples (i)-(ii) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’:
(i)         ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ                       nih-áʔbuhú
            take.out=DECL=ASS=D.S                  say-IMP2
            ‘(she) is recording, tell her!’
(ii)        kǎn=diʔ                ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
            3SGM=OBJ                take.out-IMP2
            ‘take (it) out for him’
Since it seems to have a beneficial encoding (perform for the benefit of someone else), the following
considerations might be relevant for a future study of this imperative: i) Kakua does not have a dedicated
marker for benefactive roles (see discussion in Chapter 6), ii) many Vaupés languages also do not have
dedicated markers for benefactive roles; iii) Kakua does not have a dative case marker (another possible
source for the development of a benefactive encoding of a form). If the source were a dative case marker,
however, it would be necessary to explain why and how a case marker becomes a verbal morpheme; iv)
many Vaupés languages have been described to lack a dative marker; v) Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,
has been described as making five case distinctions, among which a dative; vi) Kakua, as many of its
neighboring groups in the Vaupés, makes three morphological distinctions, for case: Object arguments,
Locatives, and Comitative and Instrumental; vii) Nɨkak’s dative marker is -éʔ (see Mahecha 2009); viii)
there is a regular sound correspondence of Nɨkak /e/ to Kakua /a/. This may be relevant for the complex
benefactive imperative form in Kakua -áʔbuhú; ix) because of Kakua’s phonological (syllabic structure,
vowel harmony) and morphological rules, we know that -áʔbuhú imperative is a complex form.

      ‘Katherine, don’t push them! they have said’       As seen in (110) above, constituent order in negative imperatives clauses is
typically verb final; and whenever both the subject and object are overtly expressed
through a lexical noun or free pronoun, the order of subject and object is inverted
from the typical SOV basic order in Kakua, resulting in OSV (although speakers
accept other orders). The change of the preferred order into an OSV order is typical
for imperative clauses cross-linguistically (c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97).","[356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361]"
"6.4.2 Comitative and instrumental
        Expressions involving nominals in comitative or instrumental roles are coded
with the clitic =hĩʔ ~ =hiʔ.̃́ The difference between nominals in comitative versus
nominals in instrumental role in Kakua corresponds basically to the distinction of
whether the action is being performed together with a usually animate entity, versus
if the action is being performed using/by means of another entity (usually inanimate).
That is to say, a comitative interpretation of the morpheme clitic =hĩʔ, occurs when
a noun (usually animate) participates in an action together with the subject of the
clause: subject together with comitative performs an action.
        The instrumental interpretation of the noun marked with =hĩʔ occurs when
something is being used by an Agent argument to perform an action: Action
performed with/using instrumental.
        The syntactic structure of clauses involving comitative or instrumental
nominals do not differ one from the other.
     Examples (79)-(80) illustrate cases of noun phrases in the comitative role. Note
that in these examples the object marker =diʔ is not used, showing that its
occurrence on comitative noun phrases is not governed by the same principles as
DOM, according to which they should be marked for being human.

    ‘We also worked clothing (sew clothes) with the (sewing) machine’        It is very likely that using the same morpheme to code nouns in comitative
and instrumental roles, responds to an iconic motivation of the close semantic
relatedness between these two concepts. Example (85) below illustrates an instance
that can be interpreted as both instrumental or comitative. It is extracted from a
conversation, where the speaker is telling about his hunting trip, during which he
found an alligator and chopped off the tail of the animal. In a joking manner he tells
his interlocutor that the tip of the alligator (full of leeches) was tasty to eat together
with manioc bread, or by using the manioc bread to push up the leeches on the
alligator’s tail. Both readings where suggested by the speaker who helped with the
translation of this text:85) ʔãjʔ=pĩh              jâp-at=diʔ                 hěmʔ-at=jɨ ̀ʔ=hiʔ̃́

6.4.3 Terminative
        Kakua codes terminative locatives with the preposition pɨ ‘TERM’. This
morpheme is particular in its semantics and its syntax. Semantically, it has a very
narrow meaning, similar to English up until. Terminatives are used to refer to a
specific spatial or temporal location which is situated within a space or time that has
a further continuation. For example, ‘we will walk up until the house’, implying that
there is a path that goes beyond the house, but that our journey will go only up until
where the house is:86) ma=beh-é            pɨ        fwĩ=ʔɨw-at-hɨʔ=na

    3SG=EVID-come=REM.PST TERM PROX.DEM=DECL
    ‘he (the grandfather) came up to there’       Similarly, for temporal senses, it can be used to refer to a specific time during
a specific event, such as I slept up until 7am, implying that the timeframe of the
story continues, but the sleeping was terminated at 7am. The example is given in
(89) below:89) pɨ             siete,             siete=jǔb         wã=beh-ep=hĩ,

      ‘(I slept) up until 7am, at seven really, I went first thing in the morning up until
      the Sloth Hill’       Syntactically, the terminative marker is unique in that it functions as a
preposition, while no other prepositions are attested in Kakua.

                      Elements of the noun phrase
7.0    Introduction
        This chapter describes other words from closed classes that occur in the noun
phrase. In particular this chapter deals with the description of pronouns,
demonstratives, questions words, numerals and quantifiers in Kakua, and further
additional elements of the noun phrase.
        The noun phrase in Kakua is built according to the template in (1) below.
Demonstratives (DEM), lexical possessors (POSS), pronouns (PN) including
possessive and interrogative pronouns, numerals (NUM) and quantifiers (Quant) all
precede the head noun. A head noun may be a bare noun root (see Chapter 4), a
compound of noun roots (see Chapter 5), or another derived noun (e.g., a
nominalized verb stem, or a noun stem taking some derivational morphology). Any
of the elements shown in (1) below with the exception of modifiers can also function
as a noun phrase on its own. Modifiers of the head noun (adjectives or nominalized
verbs) may precede or follow the head noun (see discussion on adjectives in Chapter
3, §3.2.1).","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"
"2.1.3 Phonotactics of vowels
       This subsection summarizes the distribution and restrictions of Kakua’s
vowels.
       The syllabic structure of Kakua roots is such that unexceptionally they must
have an onset (see §2.2 below for a description of syllable structure). Thus, since
roots of the type VC or V are not allowed, vowels do not occur in root initial position.
Only suffixes can have syllabic structures o the type VC. In these type of suffixes,
any vowel of Kakua’s vowel inventory may occur in initial position.
       Vowel sequences do not appear to be a regular feature in the phonology of
Kakua. Only a very limited number of vowel sequences have been found in the
current lexical database, these are shown in (6) below. Note that many of these
sequences also have /o/:6) a.         /pêa/      [pêa] ‘to finish’
   b.         /hěa/      [hèá] ‘sky’
   c.         /hoa/       [hoa] ‘down river’
   d.         /bua/       [mbua] ‘heal’
   e.         /jôaʔ/     [dʒôaʔ] ‘clean front yard’
   f.         /hò̃̌aʔ/   [hò̃̀áʔ] ‘meet’
   g.         /tôaʔ/     [tôaʔ] ‘approach’
   h.         /ʔuat/      [ʔuat] ‘untangle a knot’
   i.         /ʔũat/     [ʔũat] ‘prick with a finger into a small hole’
   d.         /koatá/     [koatá] ‘white fronted spider monkey’ (Ateles belzebuth sp)       A diachronic evaluation of these words may help explain these unusual
sequences of vowels in Kakua. The word for ‘finish’ for example, pêa, illustrated in
(6) above has a similar meaning and at least part of the phonological form of the
verb pê ‘be last’. It might be that Kakua pêa ‘finish’ derived from a compound of
the element pê ‘be last’ and another postponed element (suffix, clitic, or root) that
got lexicalized resulting in what is today considered one lexical word with an unusual
sequence of vowels.
       Additionally, for forms like koatá ‘spider monkey, sp’, in (5) and (1) above,
may best be explained as a borrowing (see comment above).
       Vowel length is not a phonemic feature of Kakua’s vowel inventory. Vowel
length consistently occurs as a phonetic process in open syllables, especially in word-
final positions /CV/ [CV:]:7)   /ʧɨ ̂/               [ʧɨ ̂:]   ‘pineapple’
28     A Grammar of Kakua8)   /jǔ        měm=tiɁ        hépaʔ=ni/            [ʤǔ: měm=tiɁ hépaʔ=ni:]
     armadillo 2SG=INTS          answer=S.S
     ‘Armadillo (nick name), you answer’        More sporadically, phonetic vowel lengthening also occurs in closed syllables
with voiced obstruents and glides as codas /CVC +Glide/ [CV:C+Glide]~ [CV:C+Glide];
/CVC+voice/ [CV:C+voice] ~ [CV:C+voice]. This last instance of phonetic vowel
lengthening in /CVC/ syllables occurs with variation among speakers. Thus, words
such as /bûd/ ‘cut’ may be realized both as [bû:dn] or [bûdn]. Likewise, words
involving glides, such as /hǔj/, may be realized both as [hǔj] or [hǔ:j].
        In the previous version of Kakua phonology of 2010, I included a set of three
lexical elements where glides combined to form a diphthong. These were shown in
(9) below:9)   a. /hja/    [hj ̀a]    ‘forest’
     b. /hjat/ [hj ̀at̚]    ‘place where light is reflected’
                      ̀̃̂
     c. /~dĵat/ [njãt]    ‘everything/everybody’       Since then, I reevaluate two of these three forms, and present a different
representation as shown in (10) below:10) a. /hja/                [hj ̀a]   ‘forest’
    b. /hǐ-at/             [hjǎt] (light.up-NMLZ) ‘place where light is reflected’
    c. /~dîɁat/            [nîɁãt] ‘everything/everybody’         Note that for the set above, only the word for ‘forest’ hja, remains as an
exception (alternatively, this could also have been diachronically hi-a, where -a
might have once been a suffix of some kind, now lost). The word for ‘a place where
light is reflected’ was reevaluated and it was concluded that it was in fact a compound
of the verb hǐ ‘to light up’ and the nominalizer suffix -at. Likewise, a more careful
phonetic analisis of the word for ‘everyting/everybody’, unvealed a glottal voiceless
occlusive that was previously not detected. The form is then reassessed and instead
of the form /~dĵat/, I now correct it to /~dîɁat/, where there is no diphthong for this
word.

       Kakua has seventeen contrastive consonantal segments. The consonant
inventory is given in Table 2.5 below:Table 2.5 The Kakua Consonant Inventory

  Approximants
    Affricate                                         ʧ        Two of Kakua’s consonants, /f/ and /l/, are not encountered in morpheme-
final position. The voiced velar stop /g/ and its glottalized counterpart /g Ɂ/, on the
other hand, only appear in morpheme-final position. From a typological perspective,
it is not unusual to find a gap in the voiced velar slot in the phonological inventory
of a language (see for example Gamkrelidze 1975, Ohala 1983, Maddieson 1984).
Nonetheless, it is indeed very interesting to note that in a large number of languages
spoken in the Vaupés area, the velar voiced stop does not appear in morpheme-initial
position (see e.g. Chacon 2014, Aikhenvald 2002), so Kakua’s restricted distribution
of voiced velar /g/ and its counterpart /g ʔ/ might respond to an areal feature.
Glottalized consonants cannot occur in initial position. As for the rest of the other
consonants, they can appear in morpheme-initial, medial, and final position.
        Nasalization (see section §2.3.1) is a property of the morpheme, and
morphemes are either fully nasal or fully oral. This suprasegmental feature predicts
that voiced segments surface as fully nasal allophones in nasalized contexts or as
oral when in oral contexts. The allophonic variations for voiced obstruents in oral
environments, for example, have three different realizations: they can surface as pre-
nasalized [NC+voice] in morpheme-initial position, post-nasalized [CN+voice] in
morpheme-final position, and plain voiced when in intervocalic position. Across
morpheme boundaries these voiced obstruents can also be nasalized as [C +voiceN-C]
30      A Grammar of Kakuaor [C - NC+voice]. The realization of voiced stops in oral and nasal contexts is discussed
at more length in the subsection on voiced stops below (§2.1.2.3).
        Kakua’s glottalized consonants (orthographically represented as C Ɂ) are
phonetically different from the conventional ejective consonants also represented as
CɁ or C’ in other languages6. Although they can have a subtle ejective realization,
these glottalized consonants in Kakua can be more accurately phonetically described
as having a laryngealization effect on the following vowel (when occurring in
morpheme-initial position) or as unreleased consonants (when found in morpheme-
final position). More discussion regarding this set of consonants is found below in
§2.1.2.7.
        Kakua’s inventory of consonants and their realizations show interesting
similarities with other Vaupés languages. In addition to the restricted distribution of
/g/ in Hup, for example, Epps (2005, 2008) has proposed a series of glottalized stops
and glottalized glides. Also, Chacon (2014) reconstructs glottalized consonants for
Proto-Tukanoan.
        Likewise, the allophonic variation of nasals and voiced stops, as well as liquid
[l] and/or flap [ɾ] as allophones of voiced alveolar /d/ is a very wide spread
characteristic across Eastern Tukanoan languages in the Vaupés area (Aikhenvald
2007) (in Kakua /d/ has [ɾ] as an allophone and /l/ is a separate phoneme). Such
phonological similarities may be motivated by language contact.
        In addition to the phonological similarities to other languages of the region,
Kakua’s inventory of phonemes also shows interesting differences, such as the labio-
dental fricative /f/ and lateral phoneme /l/ (see description below). Although they
have a restricted distribution, these phonemes are in contrastive distribution with
other sounds, thus supporting the analisis of these sounds as phonemes of the
language.","[49, 50, 51, 52]"
"        The following examples show some of the problematic cases which have not
yet been fully analyzed. These have to do with 1) the element to which the switch
reference marker attaches, and 2) whether the switch reference clitic may occur more
than once within the same clause, and if so, what the factors triggering the occurrence
of this marker (or its complete absence) are. To illustrate a case in which the switch
reference clitic occurs twice in the same clause, an example is given in (17) below:17) ʔĩ=babʔ-át=tʃãʔ                mɨn=ɨ ̃́p=tʃãʔ

    ‘[while they were drinking and chatting] he (bumblebee) should’ve been sitting,
    listening and working and showing’       The following example illustrates a case in which the switch reference clitic
is used but the subject of the following clause is not different from the subject of the
preceding clause. Rather, it is found in the clause in which the switch of reference
occurs, as in (18), where it attaches to the noun kãk ‘person’, and this ‘person’ is
the one being extinguished, different from the subject of the preceding clause
‘mothers’. Note that in (18) the different subject marker is attached to a noun,
showing it satisfies the ‘freedom of host selection’ criterion of clitics. Also, the same
example (18) shows that, although switch reference markers can serve as
subordinators, they are better defined as markers that serve to combine clauses,
whether these are dependent on one another or not.18) bɨ        ma=mâ=na                    wîʔi-kan=ka         ma=mâ=na

                As is the case for the different subject marker described in 13.3.1, the syntactic distribution of
the same subject clitic occurs in the majority of cases, preceding the clause that it introduces. See however,
examples such as (22) below, where the same subject clitic occurs in the last clause.

     ‘Finally granddad! you bring him!, to your relative’       In summary, there are two clitics in Kakua that often seem to indicate a
change or maintenance of the subject across clauses, be these combinations of
independent clauses or combinations of independent and subordinate clauses. Note
that example (20) also involves the repetition of the verb and the object of the
preceding clause, as a strategy to temporally link independent clauses among
themselves. This strategy, described for many languages as tail-head linkage, is
presented in the following subsection.8
       Some questions regarding switch reference markers that should be undertaken
in future research are: What conditions the syntactic position of switch reference
markers? What are the semantic, discourse, syntactic or pragmatic environments that
favors the occurrence of switch reference markers? Are the conditions regarding
their occurrence in main clauses different from the once governing their occurrence
in subordinate clauses?","[374, 375, 376]"

         23 Barnes (1999:210) observes that most of the East Tukanoan languages have no coda.
Moreover, in those languages said to have a coda, this is always a glottal stop, but the status of the glottal
stop has been analyzed differently by different authors. See Stenzel (2007) for discussion of the glottal in
Wanano.

             Types of morphemes and word classes
3.0    Introduction
        This chapter presents an overview of the major word classes in Kakua. These
are divided into open classes and closed classes of words. The defining grammatical
features of these word classes are established by syntactic, semantic, and
morphological criteria. The word classes in Kakua include nouns, verbs, a small set
of adjectives, a small group of adverbs, a group of particles, and a large number of
grammatical, bound morphemes.
        The intricateness of Kakua’s grammar is due, for the most part, to its
morphological complexity. Kakua morphology is highly affixing; most affixes are
post-stem (suffixes), as is characteristic of the languages spoken in the Vaupés
linguistic area (c.f., Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999, Payne 1990, Aikhenvald 2002b,
2012). Prefixing occurs in the verb phrase only and the number of prefixes in Kakua
is far less than that of suffixes (see Chapter 8). Compounding in Kakua occurs very
productively as a strategy of derivation, possession, or as a strategy to form new
(lexical) meanings.
        The verb morphology in Kakua is by far more complex than the morphology
of nouns, regarding both inflection and derivation (cf., Chapter 8). A detailed
discussion of inflection and word class-changing derivational processes related to a
specific part of speech can be found in later chapters where for each part a thorough
description is given.
        Kakua syntax, on the other hand, is more simple and straightforward. The
preferred order is SOV, although alternative orders are often allowed (see Chapter
12).
        The word in Kakua consists of roots (at least one is obligatory) plus other
optional elements such as prefixes, a large number of derivational and inflectional
suffixes, and other formatives, such as clitics. Some discourse-related morphemes,
namely particles serving as intensifiers, or adverbial particles, also cliticize to
preceding hosts. For an overview of the definition of the Kakua word see Section
§3.1 below.
        The first aim of the present chapter is to offer an overview of the main types
of morphemes of Kakua. Note that this chapter provides only a basic description of
the main concepts that help define Kakua’s parts of speech and different
morphological categories. Secondly, this chapter describes Kakua’s open and closed
word classes. Open and closed word classes in Kakua differ in that open word classes
admit new items, whereas the closed classes, on the other hand, strongly resist the
introduction of new items.
96    A Grammar of Kakua        An overview of the types of morphemes and a description of how affixes and
clitics can be differentiated in Kakua is given in section §3.1.
        The semantic, syntactic, and morphological characteristics of the open classes
of words in Kakua are presented in §3.2. Section §3.3 provides a description of the
semantic, syntactic and morphological characteristics of the closed classes of words.","[115, 116, 117, 118]"

                                ‘with one hand’        As shown in Table 7.5, the construction for Kakua numeral ‘three’ bǐk-pejʔ-
kan-ni has an unidentified element pêjʔ, which, at this moment, remains unglossed.
In the currently available Kakua data, no source form can be identified. Presumably,
this unidentified morpheme is (or was) a verbal root because it is followed by
morphology that is exclusive to verbal elements: the verbal suffixes –kan ‘NEG’, and
–ni ‘A.NMLZ’ or ‘ADJVZ’. Possibly, this unidentified element pêjʔ is related to a blend
of the verbs roots peh-hɨm ‘be.friends/be.together-exist’ or to the compound of peh-
wîʔi-kan ‘be.friend-not.exist-NEG’. Whether or not the unidentified element pêjʔ
corresponds to a diachronic compound is thus not clear.
                                                      Elements of the noun phrase       223        The motivation for proposing a source relating to a meaning of ‘be.together’
plus an additional morphological element, relies on two facts: i) many Eastern
Tukanoan languages have a clear etymological source for the numeral ‘four’ with a
meaning similar to ‘having a companion’ (see Huber & Reed 1992 for Eastern
Tukanoan languages Tatuyo, Barasano, Tuyuka, Yurutí, Makuna, Piratapuyo,
Siriano, Karapano). Thus, extrapolating this logic to the Kakua term for ‘three’, it
could be translated into ‘that who does not have a companion’. ii) This directs the
hypothesis of thinking that possibly the form was constructed from a, previously,
complex compound involving the negative existential morpheme wîʔi-kan ‘not.exist-
NEG’, or the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ which was attached to the verb péh meaning
‘be.together’, or ‘be friends’. Example (37) below was found in a Kakua text, in this
case, not referring to the numeral three in itself, but to an odd numbered item. Here
the speaker was counting pairs of seeds, when one seed was standing by itself in the
line of paired seeds:37) bǐʔ             tib
    other            seed     ʔã=t-péh-wíʔi-kap=wɨt=hĩ
     3SG.M=EVID-be.together-NOT.EXIST-NEG=REP.EVID=REM.PST
     ‘one seed was odd (didn’t have a partner)’        Forms for numerals 6-20 are based on terms for hands, feet, fingers and toes,
added to the terms for numerals one, two, and three. These are shown in Table 7.6
below.
        Note that in the glosses given for these lexemes, sometimes the plural
morpheme given is the animate plural -wã (e.g., ʧênewã ‘two’) or the inanimate
plural -na (e.g., ʧênna ‘two’, ʧênenamîk ‘four’). The use of either plural animate or
plural inanimate is determined by the animacy of the enumerated noun: if it is
inanimate (ʧênna mɨ ̃̌ ‘two houses’) the plural form used in the numerals is the
inanimate plural -na ‘IN.PL’. If it is animate (ʧênwã kãk ‘two persons’) the plural
form used in the numeral is the animate plural suffix -wã.","[244, 245]"
"
7.5    Quantifiers
      In addition to numerals, Kakua has other morphemes that express quantity.
These are: tâwʔ ‘sometimes’, tak ‘be.middle/half’, niʔat ‘all/every’, lâ ‘times/era’,
dawǎ ‘many’, and henaʔ ‘this much/count/measure’. These terms can act like
modifiers of nouns (or adverbials) in noun phrases, or can also occur by themselves
as the head of a noun phrase functioning as quantifiers. Examples of these
morphemes expressing quantity are given below:44) panʔniʔ=na                  bɨ ̃̀   tâwʔ          wɨnɨ=tʃaʔ

nominalization of this verb, tak-at (be.middle-NMLZ) ‘the middle / the half’:48) jêw-hap-tak=jǔb                baj-ni-bit                   hěmʔ-at=diʔ

     ‘yes, half (way there) he arrived and looked’       The quantifier-like expression dawǎ ‘many, much’, can occur as both a
nominal modifier as in (50), or as a nominal head. It is usually used to describe a
large quantity or a group of entities:

7.6    The emphasis marker =bǔ
       The Kakua enclitic =bǔ is a polysemous morpheme. It serves as a locative
case marker (encoding physical and temporal location), as illustrated again in
examples (54) and (55) below (see section §6.4.1 in Chapter 6 for a description of
locative case marking):54) ʔIna         wâptʃiʔ=bǔ               mi=beh-bip=na=ka

    ‘let’s go fish downriver’       In addition to the locative use, the enclitic =bǔ also serves to emphasize a
particular participant in an event. A contrast between the locative use of this marker
and its emphatic use can be seen by comparing (54) and (55) above to the example
in (56) below.56) nih=na   beh=nit                          panʔ       ʔã=t-nih-ip=hĩ

      grandfather=EMPH
      ‘this is the one that says, goes like this, grandfather said’      When functioning as a marker of emphasis, =bǔ can attach to subject
arguments of a clause, as in (57).2

      humming.bird=OBJ kill
      ‘The children hunt humming birds with the blowgun (that) grandfather had
      stolen from his neighbors’        The two meanings of this form are undoubtedly related and probably
historically derive from one morpheme; i.e. =bǔ underwent, or is undergoing, a
semantic extension, and also developed different distributions: one occurs with
subjects whereas the other (locative) cannot. The direction of this semantic extension
(or semantic shift) would probably have been from physical location which became
associated, over time, with the ‘location’ of a participant within the discourse,
following the cross-linguistically the common pathway from a concrete spatial
meaning to other more abstract meanings (e.g., of time or discourse relevance).
        Whichever the direction might be, the semantic extension, or shift, of =bǔ
developed with a functional motivation, in which either a physical location became

             Note that ‘neighbours’ here is a lexicalized construction functioning as a noun (from peb-hɨm-
nit [be.close-exist-SUBR] literally ‘those who are close by’).

more abstract-like discourse marking of participant location became associated to
the physical location of a referent.
       This enclitic is glossed as ‘LOC’ when functioning to mark location, and as
‘EMPH’ when its use is to emphaticize a participant of the discourse. Further
examples of the emphatic use follow.58) panʔ=na                 kǎn     jǔ=bǔ

8.0    Introduction
        The morphology of verbs in Kakua is complex. Verbal morphology is highly
agglutinative (“concatenative” in Bickel’s 2007 terms), i.e. several functional
morphemes and roots concatenate to form the verbal word.
        While most Kakua clitics and affixes occur after the stem, verbs have the only
prefixing positions in Kakua, but even in verbs, suffixes and enclitics far outnumber
prefixes and proclitics. These prefixes encode some of the evidentiality categories
fused with aspectual distinctions (see Chapter 11), and the reflexive/reciprocal
morpheme mik- ‘RFLX/REC’.
        Verbs in Kakua inflect for person and number, and gender for 3SG, encoded
in the cross-referencing proclitics which mark agreement with subject arguments. In
principle, these proclitics are obligatory on the verb word; some semantic and
discourse conditions, however, allow for omission of these proclitics on the verb.
These criteria were discussed in Chapter 6.
        Verb stems are morphologically regular, there are almost no suppletive forms
or other types of allomorphy, with one exception, the irregular verbal stem form niʔ,
which is considered to be the past form of nih ‘say’.
        This chapter presents a detailed description of the morphology and the
structure of verbs in Kakua. Some semantic characteristics are also discussed, but
the details of semantics of the verb in Kakua await future research.
        Section §8.1 describes the phonological, morphological and semantic
characteristics of verbs in Kakua. Section §8.2 is dedicated to the different semantic
classes of verb roots, i.e. the semantic distinctions of positional, stative, motion, and
descriptive verbs. The basic morphological template of verbs and the structure of the
predicate is discussed in §8.3. Further verbal constructions, like compounding,
serialization, and other tense, aspect, mood, modality and evidentiality distinctions
are discussed in subsequent chapters.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"

10.4.1 Declarative mood =na
        The declarative marker in Kakua expresses an assertion without indicating
the reasons for that assertion or the speaker’s commitment to it (as in the definition
of declaratives given in Palmer 2001:64). It is, in terms of Palmer (2001:64), an
“unqualified assertion”. This characterization of the semantics of the declarative
marker in Kakua also implies that a proposition marked with the declarative mood
can be further specified by modality in order to convey the speaker’s commitment
to it.
        In Kakua the declarative marker can co-occur with some evidential markers,
as long as they encode, by themselves, a certain degree of assertion. Such is the case
of the reported evidential clitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, in which the degree of assertion is
entirely a third party’s responsibility (see examples below).
        The declarative marker in Kakua is the clitic =na ‘DECL’, and although its
most common host is the predicate (verb; as in Table 10.4 above), the declarative
marker can also attach to other parts of speech such as nouns, pronouns,

    ‘so, (like this he) is saying’        As stated in the introduction to this section, the declarative marker is not
restricted to main clauses, as illustrated in the following example. Note that the
declarative marker occurs on the elements of the subordinated clause: 747) [ʔĩ=hǐt-feh-ni=na=diʔ                            ʔĩɁ=mup-ni=na=diʔ

     3PL=drink-SUBR=DECL            everything       3SG.M=HAB-take-finish
     ‘he would always take everything, that which they grinded and left, that which
     they rotted (manioc), that which they drink (beer)’        Assessments can refer to situations in the future or the past. Because of this,
the declarative marker can also co-occur with markers of tense distinctions. This is
illustrated in the following examples:
        6
           Note cases such as the one in (45), where the declarative enclitic occurs twice. Cases like this
are not explained in this grammar and future research is necessary to understand this phenomenon.
         7
            This is a very intriguing syntactic distribution of the declarative marker, occurring in
subordinate clauses even when not necessarily conveying reported speech. Perhaps an explanation for this
strange occurrence in subordinate clauses can be found in other semantic values that the declarative
marker can convey. For example, as implied above, the declarative marker can also convey some kind of
evidentiality value (i.e., that of an ‘unqualified assertion), as opposed to strictly functioning as a
declarative marker. In this sense, the declarative marker in Kakua would have properties of both illocution
and modality markers, blurring the line between these two type of mood markers.

    ‘now she is going to record you’        A few examples above have illustrated the declarative occuring with the
marker of assertion =ka (e.g., (46), (48), and (50)), this serves to illustrate how
clauses with the illocution marker for declarative can be further specified for
modality.
        Likewise, the declarative marker can also occur in sentences marked with the
reported evidential. This is the only evidential category with which the declarative
can co-occur (be it marked by the reportative enclitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, or with the
second-hand evidential prefix t- ~ ti- ‘EVID’, as long as the sentence represents
reported information. Sentences of inferred evidentiality cannot contain the
declarative marker.8 See §10.6 below for a description of the different evidentiality
distinctions). The following examples illustrate the occurrence of the declarative in
reportative sentences:51) kět=diʔ           mi=t-nih=na=wɨt=hĩ,
    3PL=OBJ            3SG.F=EVID-say=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST      dě=beh=tigá                           ɲi=tʃãh

      3SG.F=EVID-say=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST
      ‘She asked them, where are you all going?’
         8
           I believe that one possible explanation for this is that perhaps the inferred evidentiality category
reduces somehow the degree of assertion of a situation. The situation is more likely to be asserted if the
speaker has either full commitment towards the veracity of it, or if the commitment towards the veracity
of the situation falls completely onto someone else. Thus, if the sentence is marked for reported
evidentiality, the responsibility of what is being asserted is not entirely on the speaker’s behalf, but on
somebody else’s. An inferred statement, on the other hand, implies the speaker’s own inferences as regards
the situation and may compromise her reputation if the situation is asserted based on inferred grounds.
This may also serve as another argument suggesting that the declarative marker has some kind of
evidential function.

    ‘their brother in law arrived (it is said)’       The ability of the declarative marker to occur in reportative sentences is
predicted in Hengeveld (2004:1191), referring to quotations as one of the typical
environments in which a declarative marker can occur. 9 More discussion of
declarative clauses is found in Chapter 12.","[303, 304, 305, 306]"

13.4 Bare verb roots as clause linkers: tail-head linkage       In addition to the switch reference markers presented in §13.3 above, Kakua
uses repetition of bare verb roots as a strategy to link clauses, in a system of ‘tail-
head linkage’9 (c.f., Hopper 1979, Stirling 1993, Thompson et al. 2007; also Givón
2001: 347). Tail-head linkage, as described previously for other languages, consists
of connecting (groups of) sentences or clauses by partially or completely repeating
the predicate of the last element of the linked clauses or sentences (the ‘tail’) at the
         7
             Note also that, as in the case of the different subject marker, the same subject marker in example
(15) and (23) above is cliticized onto an element of the main clause. Thus, this same subject marker should
not be described as a marker of subordination, rather, it can be more accurately described as a marker
that serves to combine clauses.
         8
             Note however that the repetition of the object argument is not a usual characteristic of tail-head
linkage strategies.
         9
              Other terms used are ‘linkage’, ‘head-tail linkage’, ‘recapitulative linkage’, ‘tail-head
recapitulation’ (c.f., Guillaume 2011:109 ff and other references there given). It is commonly found simply
with the abbreviation THL.
356 A Grammar of Kakuabeginning (the ‘head’) of the following sentence (c.f., Hopper 1979, Stirling 1993,
Guillaume 2011:110).10
          Kakua uses tail-head linkage as a way to temporally connect sentences or
clauses together, to recapitulate parts of the previous sentence or clause that sets the
(simultaneous) beginning of the following sentence or clause. When using a predicate
as a ‘linker’ (or connector of a chain of clauses or sentences), most of the verbal
morphology can omitted, but it is not obligatorily omitted. The only verbal
morphology that must be omitted with predicates when these are functioning as
linkers are cross-referencing proclitics. Suffixes and enclitics, on the other hand,
seem to be allowed in these connecting predicates. An example of the repetition of
a predicate as a linking strategy is given below (see also example (20) above). The
translation given to the connecting predicates is usually that of ‘while VERBing’, or
‘once VERBed’, or ‘after VERBing’. The connecting predicate is boldfaced:24) dettũp ʔã=t-jâj-ap=wɨt=hĩ         jâj=na                                      ɲâw-ɲàʔ-be

     3SG.M
     ‘he pulled a liana, (after) pulling he ran off’       An interesting characteristic of this repetition of the predicate as a linking
strategy in Kakua is that many examples show the repetition of the object argument
as well. Examples of this are given in (25)-(26) below:25) ʔã=ta-hɨjbi           ʔibi-bâdʔdaʔ                             hɨjbi

    ‘the deceased uncle arrived here, arriving here with company he took our
    deceased mom’
        10
             Some authors, e.g., Seifart (2010b) for Bora, include not only predicates, but also other linking
elements (such as pronouns) in the description of ‘tail-head linkage’ for specific languages.

there seem to be different tense values for the tail-head linking verbs. Note in the
following example that the ‘repeated’ verb is marked for remote past, while in the
preceding instance it is marked for recent past. Examples such as this also raise
questions regarding the exact way in which this strategy of repetition of predicates
relates to the canonical description of tail-head linking strategies.27) kět ʔĩ=t-ʔɨw-ɨp=ta=be                 ʔɨw-ɨp=hĩ

    house         do-sleep
    ‘they slept, (after) sleeping, (they) made a house and slept’       De Vries (2005:376f), in a typological study of tail-head linkage in Papuan
languages, reports that in some of those languages, instead of repeating the last
predicate of the ‘tail’ clause, the tail-head linkage is formed by using a verb meaning
‘do’ or ‘be’ (translating into ‘having done that/so’ or ‘being so’). This type of linkage
strategy de Vries labels ‘generic verb linkage’.11 Similar to this, Kakua often uses
the verb pêa ‘finish’ as the linking ‘generic’ verb instead of repetition of the same
predicate in the ‘tail’ clause is used. This strategy in Kakua serves as a temporal
linkage of clauses, indicating the temporal sequence of the events. The translation
given in these constructions is ‘after finishing VERB’, referring to the completion of
the event expressed by the predicate of the ‘tail’ clause. See the following example:28) tâʔ-kit                           nin=diʔ         peŵʔ-jòʔbâ=ka

    ‘to this base of the blowgun hammer until it exits across, finishing, do well this
    one’
       11
            Also called ‘summary-head linkage’ in Thompson et al. (2007: 274ff).
358 A Grammar of Kakua         The verb pêa ‘finish’ can also occur together with a repeated predicate of the
‘tail’ clause, reinforcing the temporal sequencing of the linked clauses. The following
example illustrates this:29) bûd-hênaʔ=buh=nit mǐʔ=wãw-jùk     newěɁ Ɂãǰʔ=daʔ
    cut-count=DIR=S.S 3SG.F.POSS=head-hair man 3SG.M.POSS=CL:round    ʔĩ=t-tʃãh-ãp=wɨt=hĩ,                           tʃãh-pêa=nit    kǎnʔ=diʔ

    3PL=EVID-bath-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘(they) cut her hair like a man’s head they did, finishing doing, they bathed her’        The use of bare verb roots as a tail-head linkage strategy in Kakua serves to
maintain a temporal continuity of the events when there is a sequencing of clauses
in the discourse. As can be seen in the examples in this section, the sequence of
clauses may, but need not, be dependent on one another. As with the description for
switch reference markers presented in the preceding section (§13.3), tail-head
linkage in Kakua is more accurately described as a strategy of linking combined
clauses, rather than merely a subordination strategy, although it may serve to
introduce a subordinate clause.
        The tail-head linkage strategy presented here for Kakua behaves similarly to
those described for other South American, and particularly Amazonian, languages
(e.g., Guillaume 2008 for Cavineña, Zariquiey 2011 for Panoan Kakataibo; Michael
2009 for Zaporoan Iquitos; Overall 2016 for Chicham Aguaruna). It has been noted
before (c.f., Guillaume 2011:112f) that there may be a correlation in some languages
that have tail-head linkage strategies to also have a switch-reference system.
        The fascinating expression of tail-head linkage and switch-reference, and the
further unexplored functions or semantics that these might encode in Kakua, should
be further explored in future analysis and research to expand on the basic description
presented here. For example, it will be interesting to see whether the tail-head linkage
system or the switch reference markers can be analyzed as a type of cosubordination
(as defined by Van Valin & LaPolla 1997) in Kakua.","[376, 377, 378, 379]"
"2.3.2 Tone
        Although contrastive lexical tone seems to be a phonological feature shared
by a good number of languages all the way from the Vaupés area to Peru (Aikhenvald
& Dixon, 1999:10), the typology of tonal systems of Amazonian languages has only
recently begun to be explored. Hyman (2010) has investigated correlations between
tone, metrical stress, syllable structure, coda voicing, and laryngealization in a
number of Amazonian languages and suggests that it is possible that the development
of tone in at least some South American languages is relatively recent (Hyman
2010:7).
        Previous studies of the tonal system of Kakua are limited to Cathcart’s (1979)
manuscript, and Hyman’s short (two-page) interpretation of this manuscript (Hyman
n.d.). In Cathcart (1979) the inventory of tones in Kakua is described as having 4
tonal values: /H/, /L/, /HL/, and /LH/. Based on my data, I propose that Kakua
displays a tonal inventory of 3 contrastive phonological tones: LH [rising] (/LH/
[LH]), HL [falling] (/HL/ [HL]), and L [low] (/L/ [L]). The analysis presented in this
section is still in progress and should be taken as preliminary. Some problematic
issues are discussed in §2.3.3 below.
        I have chosen to orthographically represent Kakua’s three phonological tones
with diacritics above the vowel in which the most of tone is realized (as it has been
used throughout the text of this work). The realization of tone is discussed in more
length in the present section). The three tones are represented as follow: LH [rising]
tone with a caron [ˇ]; HL [falling] tone is represented with a circumflex accent [ˆ];
and L [low] tone with a grave diacritic [ ].̀ Note that even though tone is marked
above one specific segment (the vowel), it should be understood as a prosodic feature
associated with the entire morpheme.
                                                                                        Phonology 71     Example in (105) below illustrates the three contrastive tones in Kakua in
monosyllabic words with identical segments:105) /L/:             / L~ba/ [mà:]  ̀̃     ‘dig out dirt leaving dirt by the side of’
     /HL/:            / ~ba/ [mẫ:]
                        HL
                                             ‘be old/wood’
     /LH/:                         ̀̃
                      / LH~ba/ [mǎ:]        ‘leader’       Bisyllabic morphemes with contour tones could be analyzed as sequences of
H-L, or L-H. However, accepting this as the phonemic tonal contrast for bisyllabic
morphemes would create a more complex and more restricted tonal system in which
monosyllabic morphemes would behave differently than bisyllabic ones. Note in this
context that the [L] portion of a /HL/ contour tone blocks further spreading of the
[H] portion of the contour, showing that the [L] tone in the contour is active, blocking
spreading.
       The way I argue to account for the phonetic realization of contour tones in
bisyllabic morphemes is to assume the morpheme as the domain of tone. Hence, in
the presence of contour tones, the contour is accommodated on the syllable receiving
the highest peak of the contour, while the other syllable will hold the low pitch of
the contour. Thus, a HL [falling] tone is typically accommodated on the first portion
of the (bysillabic) morpheme and drifts down towards the end of the morpheme,
being audibly perceived as a HL-L melody.16
       Likewise, in the presence of a LH [rising] tonal morpheme, the lowest peak
of the LH contour is accommodated on the first portion (i.e., syllable) of the –
bysillabic- morpheme gradually rising towards the end of the morpheme where the
highest peak occurs. Consider the following phonetic representations below for
bysillabic morphemes:106) Morpheme level tonal distinction
     /LH/      /LH hewe/          [hèwě] ‘a moving unspecified entity’
     /HL/      / HL hewe/         [hêwè] ‘be open’
     /L/       / L hewe /         [hèwè] ‘a clearing in the forest’
         16 Describing the phonetic realization of contour tones in this way may be compatible with a
description of Kakua as a language with a word-accent system. Pitch, accent, and stress is not described
in this phonological description of Kakua, primarily because of the limitations on providing a robust
analysis of these phonological phenomena. It is important, however, to highlight that other languages of
the region (like Hup, for example, see Epps 2008), have been described as having a kind of pitch-accent
system, in which each word receives stress, and tone is realized on the stressed syllable. The unstressed
syllable in these type of systems is not assigned any tone, which means that it is phonetically pronounced
as a [L] tone. This is an attractive analysis for Kakua since, it would allow to propose that in the presence
of a contour tone, the stressed syllable attracts the [H] portion, while the unstressed syllable attracts the
[L] tone, accounting in this way for the peculiar feature that HL occurs only on the first syllable while
LH occurs only on the second. This analysis would involve analyzing tone as a feature linked to a stress
property rather than as a property of the morpheme.
72       A Grammar of Kakua       An example of contrastive tones involving bysillabic words is given in
(107):17107) /L/:              /Lfɨlɨ/                [fɨ ̀lɨ ̀]   ‘to soften’

     /LH/:             /LHfɨgɨ/               [fɨ ̀gɨ]     ‘drag water inside a river by the force

different tone levels can be found in any of the word classes. The examples in (108)
and (109) below show tone distinctions occurring in both noun verb roots:108) Contrastive tones: nouns

     /LH ~bej/   [měj̀̃ ̀̃] ‘fish trap’

      L
                 [mɨh̀̃̀ ̀̃] ‘river/arm’109) Contrastive tones: verbs

     / hɨd/

     / ~hud / [hùnt̚] ‘defecate’
      L       Ɂ       Some affixes and clitics are inherently toneless. Their pitch value is assigned
from the tone of the inmediatelly preceding tone-bearing morpheme. This means that
a portion of the contour tones will spread onto the following affix/clitic: E.g., in the
case of a /LH/ contour the affix/clitic will be affected by the H portion of the contour.
       The group of toneless affixes and clitics consist of some TAM markers, and
vowel-initial affixes that copy the vowel of the root to which they attached.
Additionally, proclitics pronouns and some prefixes (see Chapter 7 and 8) are also
toneless. For these pre-stem morphemes the phonetic realization is usually an L tone.
The motivation for considering these proclitics and prefixes as toneless, instead of
having a /L/ tone property of their own, is that these pre-stem morphemes do not
necessarily have a strict pitch-level target (see description for /L/ tone in §2.3.2.3
below).
       Some other affixes and clitics bear tonal distinctions on their own. A list
showing tone and toneless affixes and clitics is given below:
         17 It is important to stress here that in the presence of a /LH/ contour in a bisyllabic morpheme,
the L portion of the contour does not spread onto the second syllable. Rather, the melody will be divided
in such a way that the first syllable receives the L portion of the contour, while the second syllable receives
the highes portion of the raising contour (see §2.3.2.1-§2.3.2.2 below for description of contour tones).

regressively, recursively, etc.) still need to be worked out.18 However, it is clear that
toneless affixes tend to occur at word boundaries, and tone-bearing affixes closer to
the root. This is only a tendency that does not account for a good number of tone-
bearing clitics shown in Table 2.15 above.
        Tonal contrasts are then equipollent for the root/lexical level (contrasting the
three tonal levels HL vs. LH vs. L), and tone is privative where some affixes do not
          18 For this reason, the phonetic realization of toneless affixes and clitics is represented without
tone diacritics in this chapter.
74      A Grammar of Kakuabear specific underlying tones: Tone (=roots/words and some affixes and clitics) vs.
No-tone (ø=affixes and clitics).
        Tone is a suprasegmental property associated with the entire morpheme (the
morpheme as the tonal domain).19 With the exception of inherently toneless affixes
and clitics, a morpheme is always lexically specified for tone. No combination of
tones is allowed; therefore, every tone-bearing morpheme accommodates one, and
only one, tone (but see the exceptional case at the end of this section).
        This distributional restriction of contrastive tones predicts that a morpheme
(with the exception of the inherently toneless affixes and clitics) is specified for
either entirely low tone (L), entirely rising (LH) or entirely falling (HL). This is
illustrated in the representation in figure 2.17 below, where a morpheme is assigned
only one tonal value.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"

        As seen in this subsection on glottalized consonants, Kakua has a set of
glottalized voiced obstruents and glottalized glides distinct from the set of plain
voiced stops and glides. This series of glottalized consonants does not have
contrastive voiceless glottalized counterparts (there are no glottalized voiceless
stops).
        An alternative, but less elegant, analysis for glottalized consonants would be
to suggest that these are not one single segments but rather they are underlyingly
consonant clusters made up of two segments /C/ +/ʔ/. In nasal contexts the glottal
stop would then assimilate as a homorganic voiceless consonant. This analysis,
however, is made less appealing by the fact that no consonant clusters seem to be
allowed in Kakua’s syllabic and word structure. Therefore, if glottalized consonants
were to be considered two separate segments /C/+/ʔ/, this set of clusters will not be
allowed in morpheme-internal position. Also, this analysis would not predict why
the cluster combination is limited to a small set of consonants and not applied to the
entire phoneme inventory. Additionally, it seems that many languages throughout
the Amazonian region have glottalized consonants of some sort (see Michael et al.
2015). This regional pararell gives grounds to argue for an areal feature of glottalized
(restricted in its distribution) series of consonants, and accepting the glottalized
consonant series as a phonologically plausible analysis.","[83, 84]"

10.2.2 Progressive aspect: tʃahãp ~ =tʃãhãp
        Progressive aspect in Kakua is encoded by the form tʃãhãp. This, as indicated
above, can be a free (or detached) form, but can also be encliticized or even take
verbal morphology on its own as a separate independent predicate. It describes a
situation that is in progress or that has not reached an end point, adopting Comrie’s
(1976:32f) definition of progressive aspect.
        In the examples below, the progressive aspect is translated into similar
semantics as that of the progressive –ing ending of verbs in English. Nonetheless, I
think that a more accurate translation would be that of DOING + PREDICATE:32) têw-at=diʔ            hênaʔ-ʔêne=diʔ                ̌ ʔ=na=be
                                                         hɨw

      1SG=PROG=REC.PST
      ‘I was coming to predict the weather’ ( lit. ‘I came to the job of counting and
      seeing)       I propose this alternative translation on the basis of the (possible) etymology
of the progressive form: it is possible that the progressive form corresponds to a
grammaticalized construction of the verb tʃãh ‘do’ plus the general past marker -Vp,
                                                   Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality                277together forming the progressive tʃãhãp.2 Perhaps the (presumably) verbal identity
of one of the elements in the progressive form (i.e., the verb root tʃãh ‘do’), can help
to understand the versatile morphosyntactic behavior of the progressive tʃãhãp. Verb
stems (as seen in Chapter 8) can be compounded, and this might explain why the
progressive tʃãhãp (which may have a verb stem element in its composition) can be
encliticized to the (main) predicate. This is perhaps a trace of the compounding
ability of the verb tʃãh ‘do’. Verb roots can occur as free forms (when functioning
as a linking element between combined clauses, see Chapter 13); likewise, the
progressive form can stand on its own as a free element, though its function is not
that of combining clauses. Finally, in the same way that verb stems take cross-
referencing proclitics and other verbal morphology, the progressive form can also
take both the cross-referencing proclitics and (some) verbal morphology (especially
remote or recent past distinctions). The following examples illustrate the progressive
form as an encliticized element (33), as a free form (34),3 and taking verbal
morphology (35) and (36):33) wǎjkan=héʔ        kǎnʔ    paj̃̂ =na=ka=tʃãhãp
    be.quick=INTS       3SG.F wait=DECL=ASS=PROG
    ‘quick now! she is waiting!’34) hîb=na=ka                   wěm=bɨt                           tʃãhap
    to.promenade=DECL=ASS 1SG=ALSO                                  PROG
    ‘I too am taking a walk (promenading)’
         2
            This hypothesis is somehow problematic because the progressive aspect is not limited to past
tense encoding. A satisfactory account of the presence of the dedicated past tense marker in this
construction would need more explanation.
      3
        It is important to note that it is not always clear whether in cases such as the one in (34) it would
be more accurately analyzed as an encliticized form (wěm=bɨt=tʃãhap), or, as it is presented sometimes
here, as a free form. The only criterion for presenting examples such as that of (34) here as a free form
of the progressive is that there was a pause in between the elements (i.e., in between wěm=bɨt and tʃãhap).
For me, however, not being a fluent Kakua speaker, the pause is not always easily identifiable. Likewise,
the cases in which, throughout the corpus, the progressive was transcribed as an encliticized form, respond
to those cases in which I perceived a single phonological word with no pauses. There is a need to revise
these transcriptions of the progressive form in future research (whether or not they should be transcribed
as encliticized forms or free elements), checking one by one with speakers and test for rejection or
acceptability of pauses in between the progressive form and surrounding elements. Additionally, in future
research, stress-accent features and other phonological features may serve as clues to understand the
syntactic behavior (whether attached or not) of this progressive marker.

      ‘I was searching for (my) wellbeing’        If the etymology of the progressive in fact is tʃãh ‘do’ + -Vp ‘PST’ it is very
interesting that such a past tense encoding of a verb results in an imperfective form,
rather than a perfective one. The following example shows the verb tʃãh ‘do’ as a
lexial verb:37) dedpaʔni tʃãh=nit=dê=ka                                       wã=wɨʔ̌
    what       do-INTERR=FUT.INF.EVID=ASS                           1SG=son
    ‘what might you do, son?’        Given that Kakua has many verbs referring to ‘doing’ particular actions
(DO.ACTION, such as hûb ‘do again’, ʧap ‘perform a prayer for someone’), the use
of the verb root tʃãh ‘do’ is not very frequent across the corpus since the meaning of
‘do’ is already encoded in the semantics of more specific verbs of ‘doing’, in this
sense speakers generally prefer more specific activity verbs to the more
vague/generic ‘do’. When the verb tʃãh ‘do’ is functioning as part of the progressive
form (as seen in the examples in this section, assuming that the etymology of the
progressive does derive from the grammaticalization of tʃãh ‘do’ + -Vp ‘PST’), the
verb tʃãh ‘do’ no longer expresses the core of the event expressed in the sentence,
and it is in those cases that the construction tʃãhãp is analyzed as a progressive verb,
rather than as a lexical verb (tʃãh-ãp do-PST).","[297, 298, 299]"

three sets are represented. In (44) the noun referring to the jaguar in object function
is marked. Since the jaguar is lower on the animacy hierarchy than a 2 nd person
subject, this marking is optional (see §6.3.1). In (45), the noun referring to the
monkey is optionally marked, maybe because the monkey could also be the agent of
the clause in the particular context in which this example occurred, to avoid
ambiguity, or because the monkey is a relatively big animal. Finally, example (46)
features a rather small sized animal, which is unlikely to be the agent of the clause,
and thus left unmarked (note that my informant stated that it may as well be marked,
and still judged a grammatical sentence):44) kãk                ʔã=t-těw=hip=tagǎ                            hiw=diʔ

important animal, and thus higher on the animacy hierarchy than the object noun
phrase (‘dog’), so the object marker in this constellation should be optional. The
elicited example (49) above illustrates that in this constellation object marking is
indeed optional.50) hiw         mɨhiw=diʔ         ʔã=ʧã̌k=na=ka

mothers, with indications regarding the care of children), and ‘frogs’ are important mythological beings,
considered to be ancient siblings and referred to in the story as their ancient ‘mothers’. Note also that the
noun Hamu in example (56) refers to a sloth bear named Hamu.
202      A Grammar of Kakua6.3.6 Inanimates
       Marking of object case for inanimate noun phrases is optional. Whether they
are marked for object case can be predicted to some degree on the basis of their
definiteness or possibly other discourse related characteristics (i.e., marking of object
case for inanimate noun phrases occurs in some contexts but not others, and when it
does occurs, it might be required by contexts rather than based on the speaker’s
choice). However, in elicitation object case marking on inanimate noun phrases is
always judged acceptable by speakers. Thus, the overt marking of object case for
inanimate entities in object function is not ungrammatical in Kakua, but commonly
omitted. See examples (57)-(58) below where inanimate entities in object function
are marked:57) tɨ ̃̂=diʔ            mâw-a=ka

      ‘in the pathway, they slept in a hut’       Compare these to examples (59)-(60) below, where the object argument is
inanimate and left unmarked. Speakers will accept either the marked or the unmarked
options of these examples:59) wěm        wɨ ̃̌ʔ-daʔ-na                 wâj=tʃãh=na=ka

hodaʔ ‘banana’, and tʃɨ ̃̂ ‘pineapple’ in example (61) are all marked. This example
comes from a conversation, and when asked, speakers agreed that these arguments
could have been left unmarked as well without affecting the interpretation of the
utterance:

     ‘over there, this year, when my work is finished I will plant banana, then I will
     plant pineapple’      To avoid ambiguity, constructions involving the interaction between
inanimate referents in two or more argument positions require obligatory object
marking. See example (62) below. If in this example the object argument is
unmarked, it is judged ambiguous by speakers:62) mâ-naʔ                 mɨ=diʔ           ʔã=t-dah-mâw=na=ka

      ‘the tree will probably break the house’ (if it falls onto it)       Examples like the ones in (58) and (61) above (also example (80) below) raise
an important question for future research. In these examples (and many others), the
object marker occurs with some sort of goal function (like in húptʃi=diʔ ‘year=OBJ’
in example (61), or wãptʃǐ=diʔ ‘manioc.field=OBJ’ in (58), or location function as
in Wacará=diʔ=mǔn ‘wacara=OBJ=ASSOC.PL’ in (80) below). This suggests a
possibility of describing the object case marker =diɁ ‘OBJ’ as a marker of non-
subject function, rather than strictly an object marker. See also further discussion in
§6.4.1 below regarding marking of object case in adjuncts.","[221, 222, 223, 224, 225]"

        The third tonal value of Kakua’s phonological tone system is the low tone,
characterized by its sustained low pitch throughout the morpheme.
        Low tone is phonologically active and as stated above in the description of
Kakua’s tonal system, the tonal distinctions are equipollent. The evidence for this is
that those morphemes with lexical low tone always have a low-pitch target, even
when occurring in the environment of contiguous roots having other tone distinctions
(see 2.3.3 below for an alternative analysis where L tone might be considered also
as unmarked for tone).
        Morphemes bearing lexical low tone are not associated with zero or no-tone
Ø. Morphemes lexically specified for low tone show contrastive minimal pairs or
triplets with HL and/or LH contours. Table 2.20 below shows minimal pairs/triplets
of L, HL and LH tones (some relevant examples are repeated from Tables 2.18 and
2.19 above):Table 2.20. Low tone: minimal and near-minimal pairs/triplets:
