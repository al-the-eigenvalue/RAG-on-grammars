Positive declarative sentences are not the only syntactic structures that have identicalorder of constituents with polar questions, negative declarative sentences have alsoidentical order. Thus in negative polar interrogative and negative declarative sentences,the verb is placed in focus position at the end of the sentence, as in (12.45a-b).(12.45) a. ìggè   hàlì    dìb      àɲè     ŋà=jóg-óɲ-ó=ó

The fact that both positive and negative polar interrogatives are equivalent in a waythey cause their propositions to generate answers. Both positive polar interrogatives(12.43-12.44) and negative polar interrogatives can have either yes or no answers.","[553, 554]"

As can be clearly shown in (13.39a-b), ɪmm ɪmm can be used to negate a full questionsentence because oftentimes part of the question or at least the predicate will berepeated as part of the answer. It is common and natural to get such repeated formsfrom the class of interjection and being used as negators.","[579, 580]"

12.5 Polar questionsThe term polar question is a more appropriate label than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ question (Dixon2012: 377). As Dixon argues, some languages may lack words ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in theirlexicon and Mursi is one of them. Instead Mursi utilizes default interjections, negativeparticle word/particle or copula verbs ― see the examples given in (12.43a-c).(12.43) a.

Like in interrogative words, in polar questions, a constituent which is the focus takessentence-final position. In other words, it is the constituent with a raised intonation thatis expected to take the focus position and this could be by moving the constituent to theright most slot of the clause ―for example kíɲáŋ in (12.43a). In polar questions, if thesentence involves copula verb, obviously the copula complement will be a constituentupon which a high pitch rests, as in (12.43c).         c. ìɲè   án-í                             támárí

            ‘Are you (sg.) a student?’ ‘Yes, I am a student.’
In almost all cases, the syntactic order of constituents of declarative sentence and polarquestions are exactly the same. The English equivalents to the Mursi interjections inabove examples will be ɪmm ‘no’ and ɪɲɲ ‘yes’. It is quite common for interjections tohave a different phonology. For instance, both of these interjections contain a shortcentral vowel which is not part of the sound system of the language and may have amonosyllabic VCG shape (where G stands for geminates).","[552, 553]"
"Mursi question words occur immediately following the verb at syntactic positionswhere grammatical objects naturally belong.         Moreover, sentence-final positions,syntactic slots for core and non-core arguments may typically function as focus-bearingpositions when filled by question words. By using Mursi content questions words, onecan question the referents of clause final argument slots (NPs), location, time, quantity,and so on. On the other hand, a polar question in Mursi can be formed either by raisingthe intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at end of a clause or by placing non-interrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement.",[531]
"Moreover, content question words are ‘pro-phrasals’ therefore they may come withmarked case and modification forms (cf. Mütze 2014). Content question words are oftwo types: question words and interrogative pronouns. This distinction is based on theproperties that question words often display whenever they fill the non-question words’syntactic slots, because both types of question words can fill whatever position isnatural for the non-question words corresponding to the same slot.",[532]

12.4 Tag questions
Tag questions may carry the expectation of confirmation (cf. Dixon 2012: 396). Tagquestions in Mursi are formed by initial declarative clause (the anchor) followed byadjoined interrogative clause (the tag). Tag questions are normally different from polarquestions in that the tag clause is absent in polar questions. Moreover, the truth value                                           528

Chapter 12        Questions
12.1 IntroductionA question is one of the three speech act types whose grammatical mood value isexpressed by interrogative (cf. Dixon 2012). The two best known question types arecontent questions and polar questions. Mursi has both types. Mursi employs contentquestion words (mostly pronominals) which usually take clause-final argument slots.","[530, 531]"
"In the light of the two straightforward question construction formation types and otherless common strategies of interrogatives, this chapters presents a detailed discussion of
                                           508
the structure of questions of the language. Thus, in the subsequent sections, contentquestions (§12.2), non-interrogative particles (§12.3), polar questions (§12.4), andother questioning strategies (§12.5) in the language are discussed in detail.","[531, 532]"
"Comparative constructions explicitly indicate participants being compared andparameter of comparison (often adjectives). Index of comparison may be indicated byattaching a benefactive/dative marker suffix to the element of the parameter ofcomparison, i.e. ‘comparative-benefactive’. Mursi has a total of seven types ofcomparative constructions: mono-clausal, phrasal plus mono-clausal, bi-clausal (are oftwo type TYPE I and TYPE II), connector ɓá ‘place’, hɛ́kó…tɛ̀b ‘same…as’/hɛ́tɔ́…tɛ̀b‘be.same…as’ (‘as…as’), and one additional strategy. (Chapter 11 offers moreinteresting details on comparative constructions.)
                                           18
   Mursi has both question types: content questions and polar questions. Contentquestion words (mostly pronominals) usually occupy clause final argument slots. As alanguage with an AVO canonical order of constituents, all Mursi question words occurimmediately following the verb, i.e. a syntactic position available for grammaticalobjects. Moreover, sentence-final positions, syntactic slots for core and non-corearguments, may typically function as focus-bearing positions when filled by questionwords. On the other hand, a polar question in Mursi can be formed either by raisingthe intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at end of a clause or by placing non-interrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement (see details in Chapter 12).","[41, 42]"
"
12.6 Other question strategiesIn addition to the major ways to ask questions elaborated on in the sections above,Mursi also employs two questioning strategies: disjunctive questions (§12.6.1) and aclause with lowered intonation on its entire structure (§12.6.2).",[554]
"Therefore, when one uses ɓónnój for asking questions, one needs to take into accountthat one is asking something like ‘where-who’ type of questions, as in (8.50b) above.",[432]

          (Lit. ‘They killed the lion with what?’ (=instrument)’
Note that interrogatives in Mursi take all types of case markers that nouns can take (seeChapter 12). However, rhetorical questions could trigger unusual constituent order inthe language. An instance of such is unusual constituent order is found in the rhetoricalquestion constructions in which the canonical AVO order become VAO. See theexamples given below.(10.9) a. wà           ár-ú                    [nɔ̀ŋ]A [nɔ̀ŋ?]O

            ‘Has he seen it?’
In (10.9a), the recent past time particle wá appears at clause-initial position only inrhetorical type questions that require a confirmatory answer ‘yes/no’. This is a similarquestion construction to one used to make a question from a declarative copulaconstruction ― just by moving the copula verb into a clause initial position. In the end,the copula subject and copula complement tend to occur side by side, as in (10.9b).         b.    á                     [lɔ̀gɔ́]CS  [nɔ̀ŋ]CC?

With regard to indicating syntactic relation by bound pronominal cross referencing onthe verb, there are a number of exceptions to the generalization. The exceptions include:                                              460
A.   When independent pronouns are in S/A and O function, verbs are inflected for     person and number of the S/A and O arguments. In addition, verbs are inflected     for person of the S/A arguments ― this takes place in a k(V)- prefix for first person     unlike the second and third person S/A arguments.(10.10) (jɔ̀g)A    ɗág-áɲ-ɛ́                    (àɲè)O

B. Independent pronouns in (10.10) are optional unless they are necessarily required     to indicate topicality or focus. Yet they may not be considered as fully optional     independent arguments for the reasons stated in (C-F).","[482, 483, 484]"
"Dixon 2012: 121). However, this doesn’t mean that they don’t exist along other negatorparticles. For instance, Mursi has two indefinite-like words: àhìtí ~ [àhì-ti] <thing.SG-INDEF:NRSTR> ‘thing’ and hírkóna ~ [hír-kón-a] <person-one-INDEF:RSTR> ‘someone,a certain person, anybody’. When they are being used with the negative existentiallexeme níŋɛ̀, they may convey negative indefinite meanings ‘nothing’ and ‘nobody’respectively. The negative existential níŋɛ̀ can potentially occur anywhere, but usuallyin its typical clause-final position.(13.36) a. ŋà=kàlì=tá     àhì-tí                             ká-dáʃi

In (13.36b), the third person pronoun in the complement clause can be an optionalelement as long as the argument is cross-referenced on the verb. Thus it doesn't causea difference in meaning if deleted.(13.37) a. ŋà=ɓ=ùnù        dórí tó-jé hírkóná92

  The suffix -a is a restrictive/indefinite nominalizer at phrase level. Without -a hirkon means ‘twenty’
(Lit. ‘one man/person, referring to 10 fingers and 10 toes.’)                                                  555
In contrast, the indefinite pronoun hírkóná in (13.37b) can appear without the negativeexistential níŋɛ̀ whose meaning would mean ‘anybody’.        b. hirkón-a      ŋà=ɓá=á           íʃé?

          ‘Is anybody else here?’
One without the negative existential word has been found ― hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j ~ <person.SGINDEF one> ‘no one’ (Lit. a certain person). Literally, both hírkóná and hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j wouldmean ‘one/(a certain)person. However, there is one major distinction between the two,i.e. hírkóná is a compound word indefinite pronoun derived from the indefinite genericnoun hírí ‘man’ and from indefinite pronoun kóna ‘another/certain’ (a grammaticalizednumber word kón ‘one’). Whereas hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j is derived from the same generic noun híríplus a non-grammaticalized number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’ (cf. Jesperson 1917).

            ‘Whose plates are these?’All except one (tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why?’) occupy the clause final argument slots. As a canonicalAVO/SV language, question words occupy the syntactic slots available for object andoblique arguments. By using questions words, one can question the referents of a clausefinal argument slots (NPs), location, time, quantity, and the like. Despite these facts,tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ deviates from the typical sentence-final pattern of interrogatives.(3.121) tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ìɲè   kɛ́ŋá-Ø-ò                  jɔ̀g     tìráŋ=ŋà?

The strict clause-initial slot of tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ is not a coincidence but rather has to do with thetype of question one wants to ask, for example a rhetorical question. Otherwise one canuse the clause-final version kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ ‘why?’, as in (3.122).(3.122) ‘‘híh!’’ nà ìɲè kíɲáŋ         húŋ   ɓák-ú           kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ

"Of the syntactic deviation of tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ from the other question word members, not much isknown at this stage. However, a piece of information has been stated from (Dixon 2012,Li and Thompson 1981) may indicate the syntactic nature of tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in relation to otherlanguages. A good example is Mandarin Chinese where a single question word canmean ‘how’ and ‘why’. In Mandarin, ‘why’ is a sentential adverbial requesting therespondent to provide a semantic frame for the entire sentence’ (Dixon 2012: 414). Inaddition, it can be moved to the beginning of the sentence if the interpretation intendedto be delived is ‘why’.",[539]

One basic observation that can be made from the forms of question words in Table 12.1is the reoccurrence of /n/ and /g/ to distinguish between singular and plural numbers.","[532, 533]"
"3.3.4 Question wordsQuestion words form a class of their own but can primarily be realized in twosubclasses: simple-forms and modification-forms. Simple forms may occur with orwithout case markers. For example, ɔ́nɔ́ŋ ‘what?’ is a simple form without a casemarker. But when an oblique (instrumental) case marker suffix -ɔ is attached to ɔ́nɔ́ŋ,it forms a different question word, ɔ́nɔ́ŋɔ́ ‘with.what’ (Lit. ‘by what means’). For acomplete list of Mursi question words, see §12.2 (Table 12.1).(3.116) mèsí                ɔ̀ŋ?                       [mèsí] > /mèsí+i/

On the other hand, modification forms are those inherently occuring as modifiers withinNPs ― nì <who.GEN.SG> ‘whose (sg.)’ and gì <who.GEN.PL> ‘whose (pl.)’.

Depending on the discourse context in which they occur, both expressions areappropriate even if (12.9c) is more appropriate than (12.9b), because it is expressed bya predicate rather than by deverbal noun/NP. (12.9b) explicitly shows person andnumber of human participant of the discourse who is being questioned. Thus, obviouslythe second person singular is the addressee questioned. One can also ask for the nameof a person or location, as is shown below (as in (12.10a-b)).(12.10) a.   sárá   k-èlì-íɲ              ɛ̀nɛ̀ŋ

           (Lit. ‘The name that place called how?’)
Another means to ask, the name of a person is by using a possessive pronoun as NP, acopula verb, and the human participant interrogative pronoun nɛ̀ŋ (12.10a1).         a1.  [sárá-á    g=ùɲù]NP:CS         á               [nɛ̀ŋ]CC

Note that ‘name’ in Mursi is inherently plural, thus the plural number proclitic g= isused to indicate a plural possessed item. Despite there being a correct interrogativeword for questioning number/quantity, ɛ̀nɛ̀ŋ may also be used under certaincircumstances but whose distribution is not clear. The examples below in (12.11) and(12.12) will illustrate this assertion.(12.11) [bì-ò       kó   tènè]NP    kàrì        ɓá-á      án-á

Mursi speakers frequently use the interrogative word kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ ‘why?’ to question thereason why a certain incredible situation happened. kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ has stylistic dominance overtɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why?’, which is the only sentence-initial interrogative word. See example 12.13below (repeated from 7.24).(12.13) híh!     ná         ìɲè kíɲáŋ     húŋ ɓák-ú           kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ

         ‘‘‘Hih!’’ why did you (sg.) eat a crocodile? Also you (sg.) ate a monitor lizard,
         why? Don’t say, ‘Hunger hit me?! Aj!...’ (MH 4:30:6)As the form points out, kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is composed of purpose-like preposition particle kɛ andthe formative ɔ̀ŋ ‘what’, the combination of the two obviously did produce a meaning:‘for what’. For instance in (12.14), the question sentence seeks an answer for the reasonwhy the human participant stayed long. However, (12.14) can also be used to questionby which method the participant being questioned used to stay.(12.14) ŋáà    tíí kó      ŋàmɛ́á ŋáà     té-ú              kɛ́ ɔ̀ŋ

        ‘How did you (sg.) stay here until now?’
        (Lit. ‘Why did you (sg.) stay here until now?’)
An interesting scenario is found in (12.15) where kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is used with tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in the sameinterrogative sentence.(12.15) tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ       ʃíl-Ø-ɛ̀-o                   kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ
         why          stand-3sg.IRR-COM-MT          why
         ‘Why did he bring an accusation against him?’
The fact is that both occur in their designated syntactic slots. The enquiry here shouldbe regarding the function of each reason interrogative words. tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ always occursbefore a verb sentence-initially and has a semantic scope over the entire sentence. Sotɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in (12.15) has the function of questioning the whole motive of the sentence in asingle explanation. On the other hand, since kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is a bimorphemic form with one ofits component being ɔ̀ŋ ‘what’, it makes sense for its meaning to express inquiry of the                                           515
purpose 'for what'. As Aikhenvald (2015: 278) states, ‘interrogatives in many languagesdo not form one word class in terms of their morphological categories and syntacticfunctions’. Mursi adheres to this assertion, for the reason that membership ofinterrogative words to one particular word class seems always to be problematic as theyare made up of more than one component. Besides, interrogative words such as kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋand tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ can belong separate syntactic categories despite sharing the same semantics.","[536, 537, 538, 539]"

In both (12.1a-b), ɔ̀ŋ is in O function following the transitive predicates. In (12.1b),since the interrogative word has taken over the sentence-final position, the obliqueargument is put in sentence-initial position. In addition, the verb root tál ‘buy, sell’ doesnot distinguish between imperfective and perfective aspects. So, the second personbound pronominal suffix -o performs the temporal duty of the verb. Following a copulaverb, the interrogative ɔ̀ŋ can fill a copula complement slot as predicate nominal, as in(12.2). Since post-verbal position is associated with focus, and content questionstypically also have similarities with focus constructions.(12.2) [ìggè]CS     án-ó                       [ɔ̀ŋ]CC

A copula clause consisting of the associative (accompaniment and instrument) wordkàrì ‘together’, and ɔ̀ŋ can be combined into a single function, i.e. to question an                                             511
instrument/object used to perform a certain the action. Even if the object used is alreadystated in the question statement, the main function of kàrì plus ɔ̀ŋ is to denote anincredulous situation. Thus the whole copula structure may be moved to a sentence-initial position, as in (12.3).(12.3) [kàrì]CS        á               [ɔ̀ŋ]CC  bíró-a       wà

It is used to question a non-human subject expressing doubt. The question word ɔ́nɔ́ŋoccurs in nominative form and it occasionally denotes ‘by who; by what means’, as in(12.4a-b).(12.4)   a. kámá ám-Ø           ɔ́nɔ́ŋ

The occurrence of ɔ́nɔ́ŋ in my corpus is very rare hence it requires further in-depthresearch. On the other hand, ɔ́nɔ̀ŋɔ́ ‘with.what’ as pointed out above is a question wordthat may be used to ask about an instrument used. The instrument function is indicatedin two ways: (i) by an oblique case marker suffix -ɔ, which is added to the form ɔ́nɔ̀ŋand yelds the instrumental form ɔ́nɔ́ŋ-ɔ́, and (ii) by a multifunctional free from particlekó (has an instrumental or a comitative linker function in the examples below).(12.5)    zùkt=ùnù       k-èlì              ké       mùnì búná

For example, ɓónnój in (12.22) does not refer a particular place or location so it maymean also ‘what’. Compare the following examples : the answer to question (12.22) aquestion of its' answer could generate a particular location, and (12.23) may notnecessarily have such interpretation.(12.22) [ŋà=hòì=tá]NP:TOP      [ʃúúnú]NP              í-Ø

        (Lit. ‘Where (from who) does my becoming small come from?’) (Mütze 2014)12.2.5 ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many/much’
Any sentence containing the quantitative interrogative word ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many, howmuch’ is one that questions a quantifiable, countable/non-countable, number ofreferents.(12.24) a. àlèj ìɲè hín-í                               ísɔ̀ŋ

           ‘How many chairs do you want?’
When ísɔ̀ŋ occurs following a copula verb, it functions by filling a copula complementslot. A Mursi copula complement slot mostly involves predicate nominal/lexicalnumber words. In this case, ísɔ̀ŋ can be interpreted as ‘what’, as in (12.24b).          b. írsásí    gáwá        á              ísɔ̀ŋ
             pencil       market        COP.3.IMPERV    how.many
             ‘What is the price of a pencil?’
In fact, the noun gáwá ‘price’ (lit. ‘market ≈ week’) has contributed to the meaning of‘what’. In the absence of gáwá, this sentence would be ‘how many pencil’ ― justreferring to the quantity instead of the price. The difference between these twomeanings of the question word ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many’/’how much’ requires further study. Ifthe question is presented as in (12.24b), the possible replies would involve a lexical                                           520

During my long corpus collection in the Mursi community, one important point that Ilearned from Mursi speakers is that their preference for specific types of grammaticalconstructions out of many other types mostly depends on stylistic and ideolectaldifferences. For instance, (12.25a1) is more preferred than (12.25a2). In addition to‘how many’, using ísɔ̀ŋ, one can ask questions such as ‘how much’ and ‘how old’.(12.26) a. ìɲè      [gáwá-j        ɗɔ́nɛ́j]NP tó-jé ór-í

The interrogative pronouns nɛ̀ŋ and nój refer to the identity of human referents. Theinterrogative pronoun nɛ̀ŋ can occur in O function either following a main verb or acopula verb. There are two main syntactic slots in which nɛ̀ŋ occurs: direct object of a                                          521
transitive verb and extended argument of a ditransitive verb. nɛ̀ŋ may not be markedfor object case by an overt morphological form because it is inherently an object formin its own right.(12.27) a. mà     gočč-a-sɛ̀n      nɛ̀ŋ

Interrogative sentences that involve some degree of force do not cross-reference secondperson singular A argument on the verb. In this respect, certain interrogative verb formsare similar with person singular imperative forms.(12.28) a. bíró     áʤ-ɛ́               nɛ̀ŋ

As shown in the interrogative examples above, bound pronominal A argument suffixesare not cross-referenced on the main verbs. As in the interrogative examples below,bound pronominal A argument suffixes are not cross-referenced on the main verbs.(12.29) tɛ̀rɛ́fɛ̀      éʤ-ɛ́       ŋàtùɲ kó      nɛ̀ŋ

         ‘With whom did Terefe kill the lion.’ (Mütze 2014)
In (12.29), nɛ̀ŋ is in peripheral function and represents a human referent participant inthe joint action carried out with the A. When a joint state/action involves anintransitive verb, inherently plural verb form may be used, as in:
                                           522

        ‘With who are you?’
On the other hand, the interrogative pronoun nój may occur at the same syntacticposition of the nɛ̀ŋ, but in a different function. nój mainly has a human referencewhen it occurs in nominative form.(12.31) a. wà              áíw-ó-Ø                        nój

Mursi does not have an interrogative word dedicated for ‘which’. However, nój mayalso be used to enquire ‘which’ type of questions. Dixon (2012: 411) noted that ‘who’can only be used as head of an NP. It could replace ‘which’ as in ‘which X’ if ‘X’ is anoun with human reference (as in (12.32)).(12.32) a á                  í-Ø                    nój

             ‘Which ones?’
As it is shown in (12.32a), the number of the referents has been indicated by the verbto be (also singular existential verb form). Besides, nój is not a modifier since there isno noun to be modified. However, in (12.32b), the plural specific/relative pronoun is ina modified form and the modifier could be any noun since the modification/relatormarker attached to it is non-restrictive. Further study is needed to see whether nój isused to refer to non-human reference.The singular counterpart of (12.32b) is as follows.         c. ìɲè hàlì kɔ́-í                  ín-í                nój

One could ask about the place of origin of a person. It is not the place which is askedfor but the identity of a person. See the example given below.(12.33) a. á                  nɛ̀ŋ        hírí    bà-ì      nój-é

They also suggested that this could be one of theoldest question word formation within the Eastern Sudanic language family. Forinstance, present-day languages such as Luo (a-ŋɔ ‘what’) and Päri (a-ŋo ‘what’, a-ŋa‘who’) have maintained the proto-forms.",[533]

As it can be seen in the table above, interjections may contain forms that are quitedifferent from the regular internal phonological structure of words.

In (14.104a), the copula subject stands for both copula complements conjoined by thedisjunctive marker. As can be seen in (14.105b), normally it is possible to convey thesame meaning without the disjunctive marker, i.e. by adding a copula verb to secondcopular clause. It logically makes sense since the propositions in both do not normallyhold true or false ― as they are question types that seek confirmation and whose answercan be either a ‘yes-no’ type or repeat the whole clause, or just repeat the subjectlesscopular clause form (á čàllì/á gɛ̀rsì).","[641, 642]"

"   Regarding the morphological status of interrogatives, some appear to haveoriginated from one common form ɔ̀ŋ even if it is not easy at this stage to trace backhow they fused in such way. Especially, many of the question (interrogative) wordsappear to have the formative ɔ̀ŋ or -ɔŋ, may be at some point in early stages of thelanguage. Yet it is possible to analyze some of them as separate forms or morphemes,for which each segmentable unit will carry its own independent grammatical meaning.",[533]
"   In terms of morphology, Mursi has three open word classes ― verbs, nouns andadjectives; and twelve closed word classes: pronouns, adverbs, adpositions(postpositions and prepositions), question words, number words, quantifiers,connectors, discourse particles, interjections, ideophones, and expressives (discussedin detail in Chapter 3).",[31]
"
12.6.1   Disjunctive questionsDisjunctive questions in Mursi are formed with two copular clauses conjoined by thedisjunctive particle wo [oo]. The first copular clause will have a full copular clauseconstituent: copula subject, copula verb and copula complement while the secondconsists only of the latter two constituents. Both clauses share a single subject, whichis the subject of the first copula clause.",[554]

Chapter 9         Valency changing operations
9.1   IntroductionValency constitutes the basis for how verbs are divided into distinct semantic andgrammatical classes on the basis of the number of arguments (valents) they take. Theterm valency, according to Crystal (2008: 503), refers to the number and type of bondswhich syntactic elements may form with each other, determined by the valencyattributed to the verb. Valency relates to the number of core arguments (Dixon andAikhenvald 2000: 3). Valency of verbs can be adjusted by valency changing operations(derivations) that certainly affect predicate arguments.","[442, 443, 444]"

Chapter 3 Word classes3.1   IntroductionMursi has three open word classes and twelve closed word classes. The open wordclasses are: nouns (§3.2.1), verbs (§3.2.2) and adjectives (§3.2.3). The set of closedword classes include pronouns (§3.3.1), adverbs (§3.3.2), adpositions (§3.3.3)(prepositions and postpositions), question words (3.3.4), number words and quantifiers(§3.3.5), connectors and discourse particles (§3.3.6), interjections (§3.3.7), ideophones(§3.3.8), and expressives (§3.3.9). Although each word class displays their own distinctmorphological, syntactic and semantic properties, establishing a straightforwarddistinctions between word classes may not be always easy. For example, some membersof the adjective class share certain morphological categories with nouns ― such asnumber, demonstrative and definite. Likewise, adjectives can also share morphologicalcategories with verbs ― such as person, mood, valency changing derivations andnegation.","[139, 140]"
"   With respect to phonology, Mursi is a language with a fair number of phonemicdistinctions; it has a total of twenty-nine phonemes: twenty-two consonants (see Table2.3) and seven vowels (see Table 2.6). Mursi, to a certain extent, stands apart from therest of the Southeastern Surmic Group languages (particularly from its closely relatedlanguages Chai and Tirmaga), because it does not have the following consonantphonemes: voiceless bilabial stop /p/, the palatal implosive /ʄ/, and the velar implosive/ɠ/.

   For example, free pronouns in the S or A function of the canonical constituent orderSV/AVO will in no way be marked for case, nor will it trigger any morphologicalmarkings which may indicate the relation of constituents in a clause, whereas in a non-canonical OVA/VS constituent order, pronouns in S/A are marked for nominative case,thus now encode further pragmatic function, i.e. focus/topic. For example, in a copularclause, the first person plural pronoun in CS function precedes the copula verb, as isalways the case in the canonical order ―àggè kánó ‘We (exc.) are’. Or to turn this intoa question clause, the copula verb should be moved to a clause initial position, i.e. kánóàggè? ‘Are we?’. But, to put the focus on the CS, the same pronoun but in nominativecase form will be inserted between the copular verb and the unmarked form pronoun,as in (10.1).(10.1)    k-án-ó                          àggè-ò    àggè?

They basically allow the verb to be a focalized constituent. The verbwhich contains verb-final suffixes may be the only clausal constituent. At least inrelation to some other constituents in a clause, for obvious reasons, there will be noconstituent other than the verb which is to be made a focal element.(10.58) a. kí-ɓíg-í-ɔ̀

As shown below, the verb-final suffixes in the imperative clauses have predictablemorphological manifestations, except the -o (as in (10.60b). Even for the suffix –o, atentative suggestion can be made, i.e. following verb roots that end in vowels.(10.60) a. čúr-à

Chapter 11       Comparative constructions
11.1 IntroductionComparative construction is a grammatical means of showing two or more items inorder to note similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2012: 343). In order tomake a comparison between two items, there must be at least one quality (essence)which could be used as a parameter, and that the two items share in common. In otherwords, comparing of two or more items involves quality association, an indispensableapproach which would help us to understand where the difference between the itemslies or to what extent/degree the difference between the items in comparison is viable.","[515, 516, 517, 518]"
"   Besides, Mursi does not adhere to Greenberg’s Universal Hypothesis 12. Greenbergpredicted that VSO languages always have interrogative words sentence-initially. InMursi and in other Southeastern Surmic group languages (AVO), interrogative wordsalways occur sentence-finally. Syntactically, as long as the O argument a is sentence-final constituent, the difference between VSO [VAO] and AVO is not significant ininterrogative constructions. Of all interrogative words, tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why’ deviates from thesentence-final pattern. The interrogative word ‘why’ has two varieties, one of which,tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ, can be placed at sentence-initial position when used in some rhetorical questions.",[531]
"   Generally, unlike free personal pronouns, specific pronouns can be modified directlyby other constituents as well as by relative clause modifiers. This means, like any othernouns in noun modification constructions, specific pronouns can be marked byrestrictive/non-restrictive modification suffix -a/-ti (-i), depicting a dependency relationbetween them as head and their modifiers (see the examples given in 3.62)Second, like free pronouns, it cannot function as copula complement, as in (3.61a).(3.61)   a. á               gìój                  ìgg=ìnù?

As it is shown in (3.61a), like personal pronouns specific pronouns cannot occur incopula complement slots. Thus the interrogative pronoun gìój is set to co-occur side byside with specific pronoun ìgg. If ìgg were a nominal or an NP, it would have been                                            152

"3.3.2.4 Emphatic, intensifiers, epistemic adverbsMursi emphatic and intensification inferring adverbs may also be used in adjectivalfunction. They usually occur clause-finally.

"   Since this section is about the case system of the language, I prefer to mention twoterms from de Hoop and Malchukov (2008: 567) who also outlined two basic functionsof case marking ― identifying function and distinguishing function. Accordingly, theidentifying function of case encodes internal properties of the arguments, whereas thedistinguishing function of case encodes and depends on the relation between thearguments. The former is used more in case morphology to encode specificsemantic/pragmatic information about the nominal argument in question (p.567ff.). Forexample, the noun with nominative case in (10.26) is an agent [+control, +volitional,etc.].(10.26) .   àɲè  ɗág-áɲ-Ø                          hírí-ɔ́

As de Hoop and Malchukov (2008: 568) put it: ‘‘the distinguishing strategy is a morespecific strategy that is used for distinguishing between the two core arguments of atransitive clause, that is, the subject and the object’’. Example (10.26) above is atransitive clause thus it has two core arguments. Therefore, case has marked one of thearguments, the post-verbal subject is case-marked to avoid argument ambiguity. If thetwo arguments are already cross-referenced on the verb, one may of course ask why isthe case marking in (10.26) important. The simplest answer is; what if the object                                           470
argument in (10.26) is a noun or third person pronoun? This is due to the fact that whenthe object equals the subject in animacy and defineteness (as in (10.27), then thenominative case becomes the only way to distinguish the actual subject.(10.27)     [lúsì]O ɗág-Ø                 [hírí-ó]A
