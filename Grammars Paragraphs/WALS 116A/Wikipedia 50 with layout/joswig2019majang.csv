II.8.2 Interrogative sentence tone
Interrogative clauses receive a sentence-tone marking similar to the connect-
ing sentence tone, with pitch levels rising well above the normal high tone
frequency. This can be observed in the following example:
                        Figure 8: interrogative sentence toneExample II.40: interrogative sentence tone
   koɓùn kɛ díleːꜜrà nà oltíːrL?
   kòɓ-ín       kɛ      díl-eːr-à   nà     ólt-íːrL
   think-2S.DJ QUOT bring-CF.1S.DJ 2S.DAT.CJ fish-PL.ABS
   Do you think I bring you fish?
In this example of a yes-no question, the final word oltíːrL ‘fish (PL)’ has a H
on both syllables. This H again rises to 175 Hz, a frequency normally out of
range for regular high tones. This interrogative sentence tone is not only
                                Sentence Tone                              101used for yes-no questions, but also for questions with interrogative pronouns,
which in Majang usually appear at the end of the clause and therefore are the
carrier of this sentence tone.","[106, 107]"
"V.7.3 Questions and focus
This section presents a short overview of questions and focus phenomena, as
far as they have been studied so far.
Majang contrastive focus is accomplished by the use of the contrastive pro-
nouns (see section IV.3.1.1). Contrastive focus often entails a choice from
already known entities, which is why Dik (1989, p. 278) cautions against
equating focus with information new to the hearer. This is therefore a prag-
matically different situation from new-information focus, as defined by
Thwing and Watters (1987, p. 101): “Focus: that information in an utterance
which the speaker believes, assumes or knows that the hearer does not share”.
Information questions are a widely accepted and applied test for new-infor -
mation focus (Van der Wal, 2016, p. 264ff), as the component in question is
assumed to be in focus. The expected answer provides confirmation or infor-
mation, and as such is always new information (Dixon, 2012, p. 377). Study-
ing questions can therefore be revealing about focus structure, because, as
Dik (1989, p. 280) points out, “if a language has special strategies for the
expression of focus constituents, these strategies will typically be also used
for question words.”
The Majang language, in spite of its VAP syntax, places information with
new-information focus at the end of the clause, and does so also with interro-
gative pronouns, which fill the slot of new information. The responses to
questions fill exactly the same slot as the question words that solicited them:
Example V.91: information packaging in questions and their responses
      a) ɗàmíːL kɔ̀ tàːr woːɗ?
         ɗàm-íːL          kɔ̀   tàːr     woːɗ
         eat-AP.3S.DJ RECPST\CJ meat\SG.ABS who\SG.ERG
         Who ate meat?108108
  Here is an unexplained use of the detransitivized verb form in a question. This seems to be
  in free variation with the plain verb form in example V.92. Possibly the use of the detransi-
  tivized form has to do with the use of an unspecified and therefore non-individuated object ,
  which may then result in a less than fully transitive form of the verb.

     A child ate meat.","[386, 387]"
"
V.7.3.1 Polar questions
Polar questions seek confirmation or disavowal of a proposition (Dixon,
2012, p. 377). In Majang this does not have to be marked by any means
other than a rising sentence tone at the end of the question (see section
II.8.2). This interrogative sentence tone is in all examples only represented
by the question mark.
                      Pragmatically Marked Structures                       383Example V.94: polar questions without question markers
  a) máL kɔ̀ːL èːt mó?
     máL kɔ̀ːL èːt       mó

  b) íꜜtó ré cénkL ɗàɗàmùn júmój?

     it.seems 2S.PRAG 2S.CONTR eat\IPFV-2S.CJ root\SG.ABS
     Does it seem that you are eating roots?","[388, 389]"
"As can be seen in figure 11, this question marker does not prevent the mark-
ing of the polar question by sentence tone. The question marker is not oblig-
atory for marking questions, but it seems to be used particularly when the
question is a complex sentence, and it marks the question as such already
near the beginning of the sentence.
A second question marker is joː, which seems to particularly stress the polar-
ity of a question:
                       Pragmatically Marked Structures                     385Example V.96: question marker joː

   need-3P.DJ book\SG.ABS POSS\3S.SG.ABS DEM-SG-SP=SFT QUEST
   Do they need this book or not?","[390, 391]"
"This illustration is part of the following example V.95, where the polar
question ends in the low tone of kɛɗɔ̀m. Here, too, the sharp rise of the
interrogative sentence tone can be observed.
There is also the option to use a special question particle kíː in polar ques-
tions:
Example V.95: question marker kíː
   nɛ cìnì ɔ̀ɗɔ̀ːkà kíː nɛ kój cɛ*ːn mɛlɛ cɛːgà kɛɗɔ̀m?
   nɛ cì-n-ì         ɔ̀ɗɔ̀ːk-à kíː nɛ kój cɛ*ːn mɛl-ɛ

   cɛːg-à kɛɗɔ̀m
   3P.DAT properly
   In the future, will they understand it well (lit: will it reach them properly)?",[390]
"This marker always comes at the end of a question, even, like here, follow-
ing the SFT-clitic. It prevents the use of the interrogative sentence tone – no
sharp rise of the pitch is observed in any example involving this particle. It
often appears when the question is followed up immediately by another
question (which, in example V.97, uses the interrogative sentence tone):
Example V.97: question marker joː between questions
   nɛ kɔ̀ːL kɛkàr tàːpɛrkíŋ joː ɛk cɛnk cìnì?
   nɛ kɔ̀ːL kɛkàr tàːp-ɛrk=ŋ            joː   ɛk cɛnk   cì-n-ì
   CONJ NFUT again write-CP.3P=SFT QUEST how 3S.CONTR   DEM-SG-SP
   Will they write it again or how will it be?",[391]
"Although this sentence has some morphological complications, such as the
use of a serial-verb construction to express an associated motion, and the use
                       Pragmatically Marked Structures                     375of the dative to express possession on a kinship noun, the sentence does not
deviate from the basic clause configuration. The verb is directly followed by
an absolutive noun phrase, and therefore none of the pragmatic markings
provided by the language are in evidence. The verb appears in the conjoint
form, indicating that the P is non-topical, and no sentence-final topicality
marker is placed. The constituent order is in compliance with the canonical
VAP of Majang.
Other pragmatically relevant features are also set to the default: the sentence
is affirmative, and therefore has no negative morphology. It is a declarative
sentence, therefore there is no question morphology or sentence tone in-
volved, and also no imperative or jussive morphology is in evidence.
This section now presents the effects of any changes to this default prag-
matic setting: markings for individual constituents as topical or focus, nega-
tion, questions, and imperatives with jussives.","[380, 381]"
"V.7.3.2 Content questions
A content question contains an interrogative pronoun (Dixon, 2012, p. 400).
This simple definition is easily applied to Majang, where a number of inter-
rogative pronouns have been identified. As seen in section III.2.2.4, these
interrogative pronouns do not comply with Greenberg’s (1966, p. 111)
prediction that VAP languages have their question words at the beginning of
the clause. In Majang they come invariably at the end, in the same slot where
material in information focus is placed, and they are affected by interroga-
tive sentence tone (see section II.8.2).
Example V.98: question words at the end of the clause
   a) àríːL kój cáːL òlà cìgì ɛk?
      àr-í ,ːL kój cáːL          òlà         cì-g-ì    ɛk

      have-2S.DJ child-PL.ABS CONJ how.many?
      How many children do you have?
386                               Chapter V.7Participant interrogative pronoun woːɗ ‘who’
Participant interrogative pronouns ask for the identity of a participant of the
discourse. Majang provides three different forms of participant interrogative
pronouns.
The participant interrogative pronoun woːɗ asks for a human referent, in any
grammatical role. The form woːɗ is used for all central cases. The dative is
      L
wóːɗá , the locative woːɗe, and the possessive woːk. The plural forms are
        L                                L                  L
wóːꜜɗàk for all central cases, wóːɗàkà (dative), wóːɗàkɛ (locative) and
        L
woːɗɛːk (possessive).
In a traditional fable, where animals take the part of human participants, they
qualify for the use of this interrogative. Therefore Hyena can ask Dog:
Example V.99: human interrogative for animal participant in traditional narrative
   máL   cénkL,     ǐːnL woːɗ?
   CONJ  2S.CONTR 2S     who
   But you, who are you?
Since the woːɗ asks for a participant, it can be inflected like other participant
NPs. For example it can be used in the dative or in the plural.
Example V.100: number and case marking on human interrogative
   a) nɛ cìnɛ ɟùmúrkɛː L wóːɗáL cɛnk?
      nɛ cì-n-ɛ      ɟùmúr-kɛːL        wóːɗ-àL cɛnk

"
III.2.2.4 Question particles and question words
Unseth (1986a, p. 97) pointed out that the Majang language violates Green-
berg’s (1966, p. 111) 12th universal, which states that “if a language has do-
minant word order VSO in declarative sentences, it always puts interroga-
tive words or phrases first in interrogative word questions […].”
This universal is indeed violated in Majang, as the interrogative pronouns
and question words are always found at the end. See section V.7.3.2 for the
use of these interrogative pronouns.
Example III.26: question words at the end of the clause
   àríːL kój cáːL òlà cìgì ɛk?
   àr-í ,ːL  kój cáːL         òlà         cì-g-ì    ɛk
   do-1P.DJ DFUT thereafter things\ABS.MOD DEM-PL-SP how?
   How will we then do these things?",[138]
"The pitch on the final high-toned word mó starts out moderately higher than
the preceding low tone on èːt, which is what is expected because of auto-
matic downstep. But then it rises sharply up to the level of the initial high
tone on máL at the beginning of the clause. This is the effect of the polar-
question sentence tone. This can also be observed on polar questions ending
in a low tone, as in the following example:
384                                Chapter V.7
             Figure 11: Pitch drawing of nɛ kój cɛ*ːn mɛlɛ cɛːgà kɛɗɔ̀m?","[389, 390]"
"107
      In this context, the NP always comes in the absolutive case.
                        Pragmatically Marked Structures                            377More frequent are cleft constructions in questions.
Example V.83: cleft construction in a question

   woːɗ cì-n-ɛ     màl-ɛ     íɗítL=k
   who REL-SG-HR hit-3S.DJ man\SG.ABS=SFT
   Who was it that hit the man?","[382, 383]"
"
IV.3.8.1 Pragmatic particles
Pragmatic particles are used by the speaker to interact with other speech-act
participants. The following is a list of pragmatic particles identified in
Majang.
In Majang agreement is expressed with the affirmative particle ǐː.
Example IV.289: affirmative particle ǐː
   ǐː líkí mɛlɛ cìnɛːŋ.
   ǐː     líkí     mɛl-ɛ      cì-n-ɛ=ŋ
   yes correct arrive-3S.DJ DEM-SG-HR=SFT
   Yes, right, that is clear.
There is no particle in Majang that takes the function of English ‘no’.
The particle ánɛ expresses the doubt of the speaker to something said previ-
ously:

Acknowledgements
I want to thank the following people for their contribution to this study:
The main language consultant for this study was Joseph Kalakun. In many of
the research sessions Joseph was supported by his colleagues of the Majang
Bible Translation Project, Hawariyat Babure, Epheson Teramaj, and, until
2011, Abyot Girma. This was graciously permitted by the Illubabor Bethel
Synod of the EECMY. James Kim and Gallo Aylate helped setting up the re-
search sessions. Furthermore, James and his wife Whashu shared their
knowledge and material on the Majang language.
Other Majang speakers contributing to this work were Yordanos Addisu,
Kadiree Nyamor, Nibeyat Dimesse, and Ashine Astin.
Tyler Schnoebelen generously shared his personally collected Majang Data
with me. Sandra Hufnagel transcribed most words of the Comparative Afri-
can Word List, initially supported by Stefanie Hauser.
Pete Unseth shared more data and analysis with me. He once intended to
write this very language description, and I am glad that he entrusted me with
completing this work.
I am grateful to Drs. Moges Yigezu and Getachew Anteneh for the ideas and
inspiration we shared with each other while working on the same language.
I benefited from practical help by various friends and colleagues. David Ford
spent hours editing sound files, and even more on proofreading. Seyoum
Berhe translated materials from Amharic to English. Tefera Endalew pro-
vided logistical help in Mizan Teferi. Other workers of the Bench-Maji MLE
project, particularly Efrem Belay, helped me immensely in later stages.
My doctoral supervisor Maarten Mous and co-promoter Constance Kutsch-
Lojenga gave good feedback on all parts of this study, and more came from
the committee members Gerrit Dimmendaal, Doris Payne, Jenneke van der
Wal and Maarten Kossmann. Further conversations I had with Mary Pearce,
Keith Snider, Helga Schröder, Colleen Ahland, Michael Ahland, Mike
Bryant, Joshua Smolders, Anne-Christie Hellenthal, Don Killian, Manuel
Otero, Mike Cahill, Roger Blench, and Tom Payne. More occasional advice
was given by numerous participants on the SIL Linguistics Discussion List.
Colin Davis created the language map on page 37. Anne-Christie Hellenthal
provided the Dutch Samenvatting at the end of this book.
14                          AcknowledgementsFunding was provided by my personal supporters, channeled through my
sending organization Wycliffe Germany. Wycliffe also provided an addition-
al grant for finalizing the research in 2016 (thanks to Martin Sauer). Other
funds came through an SIL project for languages in Western Ethiopia.
Finally, I want to express my warm gratitude to my wife Corinna, and to my
daughters Teresa and Sara.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"In both cases, the two questions do not differ in their order of constituents or
in any other morphological way from their affirmative counterparts. The
only difference is a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause, as in
the following (stereo) pitch curve of example a):
                   Figure 10: pitch drawing of máL kɔ̀ːL èːt mó?",[389]
"This example also features another pragmatic particle, the question marker
kíː, which is not necessary to create a question (the interrogative ɛk would
accomplish this on its own), but it reinforces the question to the hearer.
Both particles í *ː and ànɛ could alternatively be classified as interjections (see
next section), as they can serve as non-elliptic utterances on their own
(Ameka, 2006, p. 1).
The particle àná is used instead of the imperative/jussive particle ìn in order
to downplay the magnitude of the imposed task:
Example IV.291: particle àná
   àná tùrgùmɛL!
   àná tùrgùm-ɛL
   just translate-IMP.PL
   Just translate!
Majang people greet each other by use of the particle dìgój. This is very
similar to the greeting digé observed in the Omotic Benchnon language
neighboring the southern pockets of the Majang language area. The response
to this greeting is the verb bɔ̀dɛŋ ‘it is well’.
The particle tɔ̀L is used together with the conjunction nɛ and the 1S short pro-
noun tàL to exhort another speech-act participant to act on something.
Example IV.292: particle tɔ̀L
   nɛ    tɔ̀L táL     wàɗ       téːjá!
   CONJ PRAG 1S.DAT come\IMP.SG skin\IMP.SG
   So what? Start butchering!
A final pragmatic particle is ɔ̀rɛ, which serves as a thematic development
marker, which leads into a new thematic topic in a non-narrative discourse.
324                                Chapter IV.3Example IV.293: pragmatic particle ɔ̀rɛ
   nɛ ɔ̀rɛ kɛkàr tùrgùmíːL áɲL kɔ̀nk à pèběrŋ.
   nɛ ɔ̀rɛ kɛkàr tùrgùm-í ,ːL        áɲL          kɔ̀nk  à    pèběrŋ
   CONJ now again translate-1P.DJ thing\SG.ABS REF\RECPST CONJ finish\3S.DJ=SFT
   Now, again, we finished translating this thing.","[329, 330]"
"Both clauses b) and c) are responses to question a). In b), the response lacks
the SFT-clitic, and follows the conjoint marking on the verb phrase. In
example c), the response has a disjoint verb phrase, and comes with an SFT-
clitic. So once more topical constituent and focus are combined in the same
noun phrase. If the conjoint marking were to indicate focus on a following
noun phrase, then example c) should also have a conjoint VP. Therefore it
can be deduced that the conjoint rather indicates the presence of a non-
topical NP than the presence of a focal NP (see section III.3 and footnote 48
for an extended discussion of this question).",[388]
"Both examples, taken out of natural texts, take a nominative subject with the
same verb tònú. In example a) this subject is fronted, but in example b) it fol-
lows the verb. Apart from such speech verbs, no other transitive verbs not
fronting a nominative subject were found. This may be seen as an indication
that speech verbs are treated inherently as intransitive verbs in Majang.
Another exception to the rule that a nominative A cannot appear post-verbal-
ly is example V.125, where this happens in a causal adverbial clause. Possib-
ly there is more flexibility in subordinate clauses.
The following examples give the impression that a P (therefore in the abso-
lutive case) can also be found in the preposed position:
Example V.22: left-dislocation of P
   a) mɛlɛ kɔ̀ːníjɔ̀nL cɛːŋ. kɔ̀ːníjɔ̀nL cɛ, làkíːL ètéŋL bàŋɛ.
      mɛl-ɛ          kɔ̀ːníj-ɔ̀nL               cɛ=ŋ.        kɔ̀ːníj-ɔ̀nL cɛ
      arrive-3S.DJ question-NOMIN.SG.NOM DEM\HR=SFT question-NOMIN.SG.NOM DEM\HR
      làk-í ,ːL     ètéŋL bàŋɛ
      have-1P.DJ 1S             all
      That question is clear. That question, we all have it.
   b) ɟàrtí náːk, ɗàm kɔ̀ ɟìkónt?
      ɟàrtí          náːk         ɗàm       kɔ̀    ɟìkónt
      woman\SG.ABS POSS\1S.SG.ABS eat\3S.DJ RECPST what\ERG
      My woman, what ate her?",[347]
"Example b) shows the subject noun tɔ̀nL ‘child’ to be in new-information fo-
cus, as it is in the last position of the clause, following the object, and as a
topical constituent, because it is marked by the nominative case and fol-
lowed by a modifier with the SFT-marker. The language consultants agree
that both clauses V.91b) and V.92b) cannot invert the order of subject and
object to the canonical order. This is very instructive for the interpretation of
central cases in Majang. If one were to pursue the analysis that the difference
between ergative and nominative was not grounded in topicality, but in fo-
cality, then all ergative occurrences would have to be explained as focused
constituents of a clause. The situation here now suggests that any constituent
in new-information focus appears at the end of a clause. But this is not the
place where ergative constituents are usually found. This implies that there is
an inherent difference between focus and ergative, which is confirmed by the
fact that when focus and topical constituent go together, as in example
V.92b), the nominative case is chosen.
The same can be tested for the P of a transitive clause. The response to a
question for the P can follow both a disjoint and a conjoint verb, and it can
382                              Chapter V.7come with and without a sentence-final topicality marker. Again, all re-

the contrastive pronoun, which forms an NP together with the interrogative
pronoun. As a whole, the NP still stands at the end of the clause. Example b)
shows the interrogative woːɗ in its central-case plural form. This example
also displays another mysterious use of the detransitivized form of the verb
which appears to be frequently used in content questions (see footnote 108
and example V.102). Semantically, these clauses are not intransitive at all;
the P of ‘have’ is left-dislocated to a position preceding the clause. In exam-
ple V.102 the P is found in its rightful place following the verb.

The participant interrogative pronoun ɟìkon ‘what?’ refers to non-human par-
ticipants of the discourse. For A constituents, this is replaced by the ergative
form ɟìkónt. This pronoun can also be used in the other cases. The dative is
ɟìkóntà, the locative ɟíkoj and the possessive ɟíkonk. In the plural, the forms
are ɟíkonàk (all central cases), ɟíkonàkɛL (locative), ɟíkonàkàL (dative) and
ɟíkonàkonk (possessive).

     I am deeply indebted to Gerrit Dimmendaal, who pointed me to this phenomenon usually
     found in some Bantu languages. He (Dimmendaal, to appear) reports a similar conjoint-dis-
     joint distinction for the Southwest-Surmic Baale language, and sees traces of it in South-
     east-Surmic Mursi.
134                                  Chapter III.3The terminology of conjoint and disjoint is taken from Bantu linguistics45,
where similar distinctions46 are found in a number of Eastern Bantu lan-
guages. Creissels (2012, p. 1) describes this distinction as follows:
       “[…] a conjoint verb form is a verb form that cannot be found
       in sentence final position, and cannot be separated from the fol-
       lowing phrase by a pause. A disjoint verb form is a form that
       does not have this limitation, but is not excluded from non-final
       contexts either, and a disjoint verb form in non-final position is
       not necessarily separated from the following word by a percep-
       tible pause.”
This description defines conjoint and disjoint in entirely structural terms,
and, as it stands, describes the behavior of the conjoint and disjoint forms in
Majang quite accurately, which is why this terminology is adopted here for a
Nilo-Saharan language. As far as I know, the terms conjoint and disjoint
were not applied previously for languages displaying ergative-absolutive
structures – this makes it necessary to use caution while applying the terms
in the Majang context with its very different syntactic and pragmatic en-
vironment compared to Bantu languages.
When it comes to the function of conjoint and disjoint forms, there are at
least some Bantu languages where the definition of conjoint and disjoint re-
mains on the structural level (Van der Wal, 2011, p. 1735). But even for
those, van der Wal asserts that “there are pragmatic effects attached to the
choice for the one or the other verb form, where the element following the
conjoint form is non-topical and may be focal [...]” (ibid.).
Van der Wal’s (2017, p. 15) most recent definition of the conjoint-disjoint
distinction is even more explicit in the inclusion of information structure as a
defining criterion:
       “The conjoint/disjoint alternation is an alternation between
       verb forms that are formally distinguishable, that are associ-45
   Besides the Surmic languages indicated by Dimmendaal, conjoint-disjoint distinctions out-
   side the Bantu family were also reported for Adamawan Doyayo (Elders, 2006) and the Gur
   language Yom (Fiedler, 2017).
46
   The situation in Majang does not fit the defining characteristics of metatony, as sum-
   marized by Hyman (2017, p. 108). Metatony in Bantu happens whenever the verb in ques-
   tion is followed by an object. But this is not the case in Majang, where the presence of an
   object in itself is not sufficient to trigger the tonal difference.
                             Conjoint-Disjoint Distinction                                 135       ated with an information-structural difference in the interpreta-
       tion of verb and/or following element and of which one form is
       not allowed in sentence-final position.”
Riedel (2009, p. 31) observes that in those languages which have this dis-
tinction, “a disjoint verb cannot precede certain focal items, such as wh-
words.” Even if this holds true for Bantu languages, such a claim cannot be
made for Majang. The conjoint form is not consistently observed in all
places where the verb is followed by a constituent in focus. The following
example shows the disjoint form preceding an interrogative pronoun:
Example III.29: disjoint forms preceding focussed NP
       ɟàrtí náːk, ɗàm kɔ̀ ɟìkónt?
       ɟàrtí          náːk         ɗàm       kɔ̀       ɟìkónt
       woman\SG.ABS POSS\1S.SG.ABS eat\3S.DJ RECPST.DJ what.ERG
       My woman, what ate her?
Furthermore, example V.93c) shows a disjoint form preceding a constituent
which apparently is in a new-information focus position, as the response to a
content question47. If the conjoint form cannot be reliably encountered in
front of constituents with new-information focus, then focus is apparently
not what the conjoint form signals.48
My previous publication on the conjoint-disjoint distinction (Joswig, 2015)
asserted that the distinction was based purely on syntactic parameters (p.
175). But this was written before I fully understood the importance of topi-
cality in Majang. Assuming topicality as the starting point of the conjoint-
disjoint distinction in Majang, as envisioned by Van der Wal (2011, p.
1735), would render the language much more similar to the state of affairs in
Tswana, as described by Creissels (2012, p. 18), which also has a super-47
   For a discussion of wh-questions as diagnostics for new-information focus, and some
   caveats, see Van der Wal (2016, p. 264ff).
48
   Van der Wal (p.c.) points toward a possibility how conjoint and focus may still be indirect -
   ly related in Majang; the assumption would be that verb phrases are marked as conjoint
   when the adjoining NP is counted as being inside the VP constituent – this would only ever
   happen to absolutive NPs, but only when they refer to unexpected or new, that is, focal en-
   tities. Question words in Majang are apparently outside their linear order in the clause (see
   section III.2.2.4), and therefore also outside the VP constituency, which would explain the
   disjoint marking preceding focal material. The same would have to be assumed for disjoint
   marking preceding NPs denoting responses to questions, such as in example V.93c).
136                              Chapter III.3ficially syntactic conjoint-disjoint distinction; it is diachronically traceable to
the presence or absence of a topical NP.
Topicality, as defined in section III.1, serves other purposes in Majang
beyond deciding the conjoint-disjoint marking, as it also is the basis of DEM
and differential-S marking. It turns out that disjoint marking before absolu-
tive P constituents always coincides with the placement of the SFT-clitic (see
section III.4), if all other structural conditions for its placement are met.
Therefore, the following is a summary of what the conjoint-disjoint distinc-
tion accomplishes in Majang:
      •   Only absolutive NPs can trigger conjoint marking on a preceding
          verb. Therefore, the conjoint-disjoint distinction is neutralized for all
          verbs not followed by an absolutive NP.
      •   The conjoint form on the verb shows that the following absolutive
          NP is not topical.
      •   If an absolutive NP follows a disjoint verb form, it implies that the
          NP refers to the P constituent of a transitive clause, and that this
          referent is topical.
      •   For S-constituents, the conjoint-disjoint distinction serves as a re-
          dundancy device indicating the topicality status alongside the dif-
          ferential-S marking described in section III.2.1.2. This is helpful in
          situations where the case forms are identical through syncretism (see
          example III.30).
Whether in a previous stage of the language the conjoint form was used pre-
ceding all non-topical constituents cannot be decided due to lack of pub-
lished data from any other related language. Currently one can only go by
today’s situation in Majang, which firmly places the conjoint form in front of
non-topical absolutive NPs, and the disjoint form in all other contexts.
So far the conjoint-disjoint distinction was only observed in languages which
do not make use of case marking. The syntactic status of an NP in Bantu lan-
guages can be captured by the more general terms subject, object, and ad-
junct, which are the terms used in the descriptions of Bantu conjoint-disjoint
distinctions (Creissels, 2012, p. 18 f; Van der Wal, 2011, p. 1738). In
Majang, instead, the syntactic properties of a noun phrase are closely related
to its case marking, and therefore the language must make reference to a
                         Conjoint-Disjoint Distinction                         137particular case (the absolutive) in order to assign the correct marking to each
verb.
It was stated above that conjoint status is a feature of the verb phrase, not
just of the verb. This is because in situations where the verb is followed by a
tense marker, such as kɔ̀, kɔ̀ː and ɓà, it is not the verb that is marked for con-
joint, but the tense marker. The verb appears therefore in the (apparently un-
marked) disjoint form, although the whole VP is conjoint (section IV.3.4.2).
The conjoint-disjoint distinction is quite useful for the syntactic interpreta-
tion of language data. The nature of the Majang case system does not allow
for an easy identification of case forms for each noun, as the differences be-
tween nominative, absolutive and ergative are usually expressed only tonally
or through idiosyncratic stem changes, if indeed they are expressed at all.
The conjoint-disjoint distinction therefore frequently allows a clear identifi-
cation between some homophonous case forms, as in the following
examples:
Example III.30: case disambiguation through conjoint and disjoint verb forms
   a) ɗeːgàr     wàrL        kɛkàr.
      sleep\3S.CJ dog\SG.ABS   again
      A dog sleeps again.
   b) ɗeːgàr     wàr         godej.
      sleep\3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM house\LOC
      The dog sleeps at the house.
Both examples have the same verb ‘he sleeps’ as the intransitive predicate.
Example a) has it immediately followed by the S in the absolutive case.
Example b) has the same S-NP following the same verb. Although on the
surface the two subject NPs in both clauses sound identical (the lack of
downstep on the nominative form cannot be heard in this context with a fol-
lowing low tone), the difference of the conjoint-disjoint marking on the verb
makes it clear that in example a) wàrL is in the absolutive case, whereas in
example b) wàr is not. It is therefore marked by the nominative case, which
becomes only clear through the redundancy effect of conjoint marking.
138                              Chapter III.4III.4 The Sentence-Final Topicality Marker (SFT)Another device of the Majang language related to topicality is the sentence-
final topicality marker (SFT).
This device consists of a velar nasal =ŋ, added as an enclitic to the last con-
stituent of a main clause, if this constituent is either a verb phrase or a topi-
cal NP. This main clause needs to be the last element of its sentence; a main
clause that is not the final clause of its complex sentence is not marked.
The following set of examples shows the use of the SFT-marker at the end of
the verb phrase:
Example III.31: SFT-marker following verb phrases
  a) kɛː ɓàrtɛŋ.
     kɛː         ɓàrt-ɛ=ŋ
     then        give.birth-3S.DJ=SFT
     Then she gave birth.

Nominalization with -ànL
Another, very similar type of nominalization uses the suffix -ànL/-ɔ̀nL, this
time copying the consistently high tone of the stem. Like the nominalizations
with -tàn, its plural form (if semantically feasible) has a lengthened vowel,
and takes the same plural suffix -àkL, but the plural suffix does not have its
own tone. Therefore, this type is very similar, if not identical, to the infini-
tive markers -ànL/-ɔ̀nL used for high-toned verb roots.

As can be seen from the examples involving the allomorph -ɔ̀nL, this nomi-
nalization device still shows traces of the Proto-Surmic ATR-based vowel
harmony, so it is probably considerably older than the -tàn suffix, which
shows no such traces. The resulting nouns are often either products or instru-
ments. None of the nominalizations creates an agent; this distinguishes them
from the -tàn suffix nominalizations, which often result in a semantic agent.","[230, 231]"
"This sentence is from a conversation about different orthography standards.
The relative clause refers to the previous orthography system without bring-
ing it up as a head noun.
The use of the relative pronoun allows the Majang language great flexibility
regarding the question of what kind of NPs can be relativized (Keenan,
1985, p. 155). Example V.139a) relativizes a non-topical S. The relative
clause in example V.139b) refers to the P and c) to the topical S of a verbless

V.5.1 Antipassive construction
The antipassive is the syntactic-pragmatic counterpart to the impersonal
form (see section IV.2.3.1), as both create semantically intransitive clauses
out of transitive verbs. While the impersonal form is used for backgrounding
a non-topical A, the antipassive is used for backgrounding a non-topical P
(Givón, 1990, p. 624). Ergative languages which also display syntactic erga-
tivity, such as verb agreement with the P, would additionally have a need for
an antipassive construction to make an A available for equi-NP deletion
(Anderson, 1976, p. 17), but this is clearly not a need for Majang, which dis-
plays no syntactic ergativity.
The presence of antipassive structures was observed by Schröder (2006) as
characteristic for Nilotic and Surmic languages. That Majang has an antipas-
sive construction was already addressed (with insufficient detail) by myself
(Joswig, 2016). More details about the form of antipassive markers in
Majang are found in section IV.2.2.2, where it is called detransitivization
derivation. By comparing the antipassive form with the impersonal form, it
360                                Chapter V.5can be noted that the antipassive marking appears to be closer to the verb
root, and that it takes further person marking. For this reason it is treated in
section IV.2.2.2 as a derivation, whereas the impersonal marker fills the per-
son slot of a verb with a dedicated impersonal formative, and is treated as in-
flection in section IV.2.3.1. This forces the conclusion that the antipassive is
structurally unrelated to the impersonal form.
The antipassive, as stated above, entirely removes a non-topical P from the
proposition. In Majang it is not possible to state an object in an antipassive
clause, except in question clauses (see example V.91).

Unmarked singular nouns
Most nouns in the sample (at least 630) leave the singular completely un-
marked. About 125 of these have a floating low tone following the absolu-
tive-singular noun stem. The only effect of this is a lowering of the register
of the next word. The following example shows unmarked singular nouns (a-
c) and singulars followed by a floating L (d-f); the possessive pronoun nàːk
‘my’ with its high tone is used as a diagnostic device to show the resulting
downstep.
Example IV.5: nouns with and without floating L in the singular
   a) áːbɛ nàːk      my fig tree       d) tɛpɛnL nàːk   my forehead
   b) màcàrɛ nàːk    my fence          e) ɛtɛɗL nàːk    my honey
   c) ùɗéː nàːk      my pestle         f) ùtúlL nàːk   my holeOne could attempt to identify this floating low tone as a marker for the abso-
lutive singular for those nouns that have it. But it can be seen in the follow-
ing sections that in Majang the various stems of the same noun can be very
different from each other, including the presence and absence of floating Ls.
It is therefore not helpful to try to distinguish between nouns that just happen
                                    Nouns                                        151to end in a floating L and those which may use it as a marker for the absolu-
tive singular. In what follows, it is assumed that a floating L is always a stem
feature. For some nouns it can be shown that this floating low tone may have
an effect observable in other stems. For example, regarding the noun dúːdùrL
‘dust’, it can be shown that the floating L in the singular stem has a notice-
able effect on the number suffix of the plural form dúːdùrɛ (see example
IV.24 for details). For other nouns, such effects cannot be observed, so for
these cases it is assumed that the floating L is just a feature of the absolutive
singular stem.
The nouns with unmarked singular can have quite different case-marking
strategies, as the following case paradigms of unmarked singular nouns may
illustrate:

Not many generalizations about the case marking of unmarked singular
nouns are possible. The ergative has low tones on short vowels and HL se-
quences on long vowels. But whether the vowel in question is long or short
cannot be reliably predicted from looking at the absolutive stem. The modi-
fied ergative/nominative form almost always has a high tone followed by a
floating L, but even to this generalization there are exceptions like cúwoj.
The plain nominative form often has a floating L, but that, too, can be unpre-
dictably absent. The dative sometimes has a L, and sometimes a H, which is
sometimes followed by a floating L and sometimes not. The locative can be
formed by -è or -ɛ or some idiosyncratic stem change involving length and
tone. Those locatives without a suffix also provide a modified locative form
which is different from the plain locative. The possessive usually has a tonal
variant of the suffix -onk, but is sometimes also expressed by the alternative
suffix -k. Additionally, there are stem changes, as for ‘heart’, or even sup-
pletion on nouns like ‘man’. But these are infrequent.
152                                   Chapter IV.1Marked singular nouns
All other singular forms involve a choice of one of several segmental suf-
fixes, which, except for the three nouns in example IV.19, minimally involve
the nasal /n/53, often preceded by a vowel. These formatives are presented in
the following in the order of their frequency. Because of their marked status,
Unseth (1988b, p. 76) calls these morphological singular suffixes singula-
tive, but in the following I do not further pursue the distinction between sin-
gular and singulative.
The full singular marker of all these forms is in fact -(V)nt, which is fully
expressed for the ergative, nominative, locative and dative cases. Only the
modified nominative and ergative forms omit the consonant -t, as well as the
absolutive forms. Because previous treatments of Majang number marking
only compared absolutive case forms, the full form of this singular suffix re-
mained undescribed so far.

III.2.1.2 Differential ergative marking
Many languages with morphological ergative-absolutive case marking do
not have ergative-absolutive alignment in all possible contexts. If a language
displays an ergative-absolutive pattern in one context, and a nominative-
accusative pattern in another, the language is said to have split alignment
(Comrie, 1989, p. 110), for which Dixon (1994, Chapter 4) attempted to
31
     The example I had presented to this effect (Joswig, 2016, p. 473f) is troublesome in this and
     other ways, particularly because the A of the whole sentence was misanalysed as ergative,
     when it was, in fact, in the nominative case.
                     Case Marking on Central Constituents                  113establish universal criteria. These will need to be discussed for their applica-
bility in Majang, as in this language, too, split phenomena can be observed
beyond the already mentioned verb-indexation versus post-verbal case-mark-
ing split. But it will become clear that these split phenomena are quite differ-
ent from split phenomena in other ergative languages, and that it is better to
describe the data in terms of differential ergative marking (DEM), as pro-
posed by McGregor (2010, p. 1614f).
Practically all examples involving the ergative case are from elicited lan-
guage data. Looking at Majang narrative texts, it is very difficult to find
clear examples of the ergative case. The only two unambiguous examples
that I was able to find in my corpus of well-analyzed texts are the following:
Example III.9: ergative case found in narrative discourse
   a) nɛ càːdíL ɓéɲ òmáltè dɛnɛ wàːloːk gòpàn wɛjL lɛːrík.

      see-3S.DJ Waalook\ERG path\SG.ABS house\SG.ABS Leer-POSS
      Then, one day, Waalook saw the path to Leer’s house.
   b) ɟàrtí náːk, ɗàm kɔ̀ ɟìkónt?
      ɟàrtí          náːk         ɗàm       kɔ̀    ɟìkónt
      woman\SG.ABS POSS\1S.SG.ABS eat\3S.DJ RECPST what\ERG
      My woman, what ate her?
In these examples, the A of the transitive clause is marked by the ergative
case, as evidenced by the HL sequence on the last syllable of the proper
name in example a), and by the special ergative form of the interrogative
pronoun (see p. 387 for the other case forms of this pronoun) in example b).
In example a), the ergative is chosen for a main participant following a reset
of time and place, and with a different subject than in the previous clause. In
example b) the ergative is used for a question word asking for an unknown
subject; the object of this clause is left-dislocated (see section V.7.1.2) to a
position outside the clause. A less clear example shows an NP in the am-
biguous form that is identical for both the modified nominative and the
modified ergative:
114                                      Chapter III.2Example III.10: textual example with ergative case assumed by word order

   because that hyena had killed his friend,The NP ɗúŋéL cìnɛ can be either nominative or ergative according to its mor-
phological shape. The reason to assume that it is ergative in this clause is its
position following the verb, where in clear textual examples nominative A-
NPs were never encountered (see section III.2.2.1).
These rare examples taken from natural discourse are balanced by countless
examples from elicitation, using questionnaires with context-free example
sentences, where practically every transitive clause yields an ergative-abso-
lutive pattern, illustrated in the following clauses:
Example III.11: ergative case found in elicited sentences
   a) ɗɛnɛ wàr àdùreàk L.
      ɗɛn-ɛ     wàr                 àdùre-àkL

      kill-3P.DJ hog-PL.ERG            man\SG.ABS
      Hogs kill a man.
Undoubtedly these examples are unnatural in the sense that it is very dif-
ficult to find them in narrative discourse. The factor of preferred argument
structure, as proposed by Du Bois (1987, 2003), in combination with the ten-
dency of Majang to avoid free pronouns for subjects, explains the very low
frequency of ergative-marked noun phrases in natural texts. Preferred argu-
ment structure discourages the use of a full NP as an A argument. An NP that
                         Case Marking on Central Constituents                             115is not there cannot be marked for ergative, which renders the ergative case
invisible in a language that only ever marks it on an NP.
Still, it would be unwise to discount the information gleaned from such ex-
amples on the basis that they do not come from narrative texts. It remains a
fact that when a Majang speaker is asked to produce a transitive sentence,
without fail s/he first comes up with an ergative-absolutive case pattern in a
VAP clause. This alignment system therefore represents a deeply ingrained
grammatical structure that probably sees prominent use in everyday natural
discourse, but not in the kind of structured texts that linguists tend to analyze
for writing their grammars. The observer is faced with the notion that “when
a departure from Preferred Argument Structure does occur in natural dis-
course, the resulting utterance bears not a hint of ungrammaticality” (Du
Bois, 2003, p. 78). After all, “Preferred Argument Structure cannot be re-
duced to a grammatical rule. It must remain within the domain of discourse,
as a patterning of grammar with consequences for grammar” (ibid).
Now it still needs to be asked where exactly in natural discourse the erga-
tive-absolutive alignment system thrives to the point that it appears as the
grammatical system of choice in almost all elicited transitive clauses; if no
one ever uses it in any speech situation at all, this alignment system would
be quickly forgotten by the grammar. Looking outside the narrative genre, in
my case, did not provide the answer: one text of my corpus is a planning
conversation between three speakers with well over 150 clauses, and still the
ergative case does not feature in this at all. The same is true for a short horta-
tory text. It therefore remains a rewarding task for future research 32 to deter-
mine the segments or genres of Majang natural discourse that freely admit
the use of ergative-absolutive systems. My hypothesis is that they must exist,
and that I just have not found them.
As for the alternative to this ergative-absolutive alignment system: as stated
above, the main reason why it is almost impossible to see ergative-marked
NPs is preferred argument structure. But even an existing A-NP is usually32
     Watters (2018, p. 394ff) conducted such research for the Tibeto-Burman language Dzong-
     kha, comparing the impact of genre on competing case-marking patters. For that language,
     Watters concluded that “grammatical relations in Dzongkha is found to range from a split-
     ergative system to a pragmatic system, whereby the manifestation of one marking pattern
     over another is probabalistically dependent on and functionally motivated by genre.” The
     exact findings, however, are very different from the situation in Majang, showing a higher
     probability for ergative-marked As in monologic texts.
116                                     Chapter III.2not marked by the ergative case. Majang noun phrases can be marked ac-
cording to two competing case marking systems: one of them is the non-
topical ergative-absolutive case marking system, and the other the topical
nominative case marking for A or S. The choice between the two is of a
purely discourse-pragmatic nature, based on the topicality of the A or S in
the discourse (see section III.1 for how the concept of topicality is estab-
lished for Majang). The elicited examples seen above show non-topical in-
stances of A (elicited examples usually deal with non-topical participants, as
they leave the relevant context open to the interpretation of speaker and
hearer), and these are marked by the ergative case. In narrative discourse,
new participants are usually introduced in intransitive clauses, or as PS or ob-
liques, but practically never as an A (Du Bois, 1987, p. 828). From then on,
as long as they are activated participants, they are topical and therefore usu-
ally marked by the nominative case33:

"I.11 Typological OverviewThis section contains an overview of the basic typological facts about Ma-
jang for easy reference. The details of all these features should be read in
their respective passages in this language description.
Compared with other Surmic languages, Majang has a very small consonant
inventory with only 18 consonants, including two implosives /ɓ, ɗ/ (see sec-
48                             Chapter I.11tion II.2.1). The language provides no systematic opposition between stops,
fricatives and affricates – all these sounds can be subsumed under the single
label obstruents.
Majang has seven vowels (including two sets of mid vowels, see section
II.1.1), without ATR vowel harmony (section II.1.4). There is contrast be-
tween short and long vowels (section II.1.3). Important phonological rules of
Majang are labial harmony, which rounds the short vowel /i/ to /ù/ in verbal
suffixes following syllables containing round vowels or labial consonants,
and the morphologically restricted vowel-height harmony, which changes
the vowel /ɛ/ into /e/ following a high-vowel syllable (section II.5).
The tonal inventory consists of two tones plus downstep (section II.6). It can
be shown that some morphemes in Majang are inherently toneless, and that
another morpheme requires an analysis involving a polar tone. Many words
demonstrably end in a floating low tone (section II.6.3), which is often at-
tached to apparently toneless morphemes. Tone plays an extensive role, not
only in distinguishing lexical items, but also in the grammar of Majang.
The Majang morphology is predominantly agglutinative, with segmental af-
fixes containing individual bits of grammatical information (only suffixes
are productive, with two unproductive prefixes). Some grammatical features,
however, such as noun number and case, are indicated by stem changes or by
tonal means. Like most Eastern-Sudanic languages, Majang does not display
grammatical gender, but it provides a very diverse number- and case-mark-
ing system on nouns, with a large number of inflection classes (section
IV.1.3). Case marking is complicated by the provision of special forms for
modified nouns in some syntactic cases (section IV.1.3.2). Unlike other Sur-
mic languages, Majang has no distinction between inclusive and exclusive
forms of the first person plural of pronouns or verbs.
The language has a variety of personal pronouns for various functions. One
set of pronouns serves for general anaphoric reference, another for reference
inside the verb phrase, and a third for contrastive purposes (section
IV.3.1.1). Demonstratives and relative pronouns code a three-level deictic
system, with reference to either the speaker, the hearer, or a place away from
them both (sections IV.3.1.2, IV.3.1.3). Possessive pronouns indicate the
person of the possessor together with number reference to the possessed
entity (section IV.3.1.4). Interrogative pronouns always appear at the end of
the question.
                              Typological Overview                             49Many Majang verbs come in pairs of perfective and imperfective, where the
imperfective form is derived from the perfective form through partial redu-
plication (section IV.2.2.7). Furthermore, all verbs are inflected with subject
suffixes. Most verbs also distinguish between a tonal conjoint (CJ) form and a
disjoint (DJ) form; the conjoint form is only applied to verb phrases that are
immediately followed by a non-topical NP in the absolutive case (section
III.3). Another grammatical category frequently expressed on the verb is di-
rectionality, which comes in three values: centripetal (CP) forms, which
indicate a movement towards the deictic center; centrifugal (CF) forms, which
express a movement away from the deictic center; and deictic TransFer (TF)
forms, which are used for a movement from one deictic center to another
deictic center.
The basic order of constituents in Majang transitive clauses is VAP, where A
stands for the transitive agent and P for the transitive patient-like constituent,
usually the object. The order of constituents is fairly fixed in the language,
except for the option to front certain constituents (mostly subjects) for syn-
tactic and pragmatic reasons (section V.7.1).
Pragmatic factors indeed have a major influence on the syntax of Majang.
The case marking of central participants of a clause depends on their topical-
ity (section III.1). If they are not topical, S and P are marked by the same
absolutive case (examples a and b):
Example I.3: non-topical case marking of central constituents
   a) kàwɛ èːɟɛː wárL kɛkàr.
      kàw-ɛ      èːɟɛː        wárL     kɛkàr

      bite-3S.DJ dog\SG.ERG   man\SG.ABS
      A dog bites a man.
50                                Chapter I.11The non-topical A, however, is marked by a different case, the ergative (ex-
ample I.3c). If topical, this A is marked by yet another case form, the nomi-
native, which is also used for a topical S:
Example I.4: topical case marking of central constituents
     a) ɗegàrL wàr kɛkàr.
        ɗegàrL      wàr      kɛkàr
        sleep\3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM again
        The dog sleeps again.
     b) kàwɛ wàr íɗítL.
        kàw-ɛ      wàr       íɗítL
        bite-3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM man\SG.ABS
        The dog bites a man.
The three different case forms of ‘dog’ – wàrL (ABS), wàr (ERG) and wàr (NOM)
– are only distinguished by tone, but different they are. Two more clause-
level cases are used by the Majang language, the dative (DAT) and the loca-
tive (LOC), plus a further possessive (POSS) case to mark nouns as possessors of
a noun phrase. A detailed discussion of the cases and their use is presented in
sections IV.1.3.2 and III.2.1.2.
Though the constituent order VAP is normal, the verb is often found at the
end of the sentence. In that situation, another morpheme is attached to the
verb, the sentence-final topicality marker =ŋ (SFT). This marker indicates
that the final constituent is either the verb phrase or a topical noun phrase
(see section III.4 for its discussion).
The language makes use of some valence-changing devices. Most notable
among those is the antipassive (AP) (section V.5.1). A genuine passive con-
struction in the sense of Dixon (2010a, p. 166) is not encountered in the lan-
guage – its function is partly covered by the impersonal form, an inflectional
device described in section IV.2.3.1.
In spite of Unseth’s (1989b, p. 106) claim to the contrary, Majang does not
have postpositions, and only a few questionable prepositions (section IV.3.6).
Relative clauses are very frequent in Majang, and can be both restrictive and
descriptive (section V.8.5). Some temporal adverbial clauses have subordi-
nate-tense verb forms (section V.8.3.1). Otherwise tense is only expressed
through tense markers which appear to be working along the lines of a
metrical tense system (section V.6.1.1).
                                                                           51
Part II: Phonological Inventory and
OrthographyThis section introduces the inventories of the Majang phonology – vowels,
consonants and suprasegmentals. It also displays the rules which govern the
use of the various elements of these inventories.
In this section, data presented without any kind of bracketing is understood
to be in its surface-phonemic representation, transcribed according to the
phoneme inventories shown in tables 1 and 3. Only when further phonetic
detail needs to be shown for greater clarity, phonetic data is supplemented in
square brackets […]. On the other hand, in some places information is given
about the individual morphemes making up a word. These are always shown
in their underlying representation, and the brackets {…} are used to sur-
round such lexical units. This is different from the other parts of this lan-
guage description, where the underlying representation is shown without

IV.1.3.1 Number marking
Majang distinguishes between singular and plural. All elements of the noun
phrase show number agreement with the head noun, and subject marking on
                                   Nouns                                   149the verb also agrees with the number of the referenced entity. Number mark-
ing was treated by Bender (1983, pp. 124–127) and in more detail by Unseth
(1988b). These works are generally adequate, but because of their lack of
tone marking they missed some morphological distinctions. Getachew
(2014, p. 94ff) filled some of these gaps by providing information on the role
of tone in number marking. All three previous approaches are similar to each
other in separating the issue of number marking from case marking. It is
shown in section IV.1.3.2 that such a treatment cannot do justice to the
morphological processes operating on Majang nouns; therefore I provide pa-
radigms of case marking together with number-marking allomorphs. A com-
plete picture of number-case combinations is presented in section IV.1.3.3.
A number-marking system as complex as the one encountered in Majang
opens up the question whether it can really be seen as an inflectional device.
One could alternatively consider treating it as a lexical process, possibly in-
volving derivation devices that create different singular and plural stems, as
suggested by Hayward (1981, p. 128f) for Dirayta. I treat it as an inflectional
category, mostly in order to present it together with other inflectional cat-
egories such as case and modification, which often combine to portmanteau
formatives with the number markers. Furthermore, in spite of the multitude
of number formatives, particularly for the plural, some generalizations can
be made about how they are applied. The number of nouns with a number-
marking behavior that is not copied by at least one other noun is very small.
Furthermore, singular and plural marking generally come to predictable
meanings entirely centered around the dimension of grammatical number.
Number marking is obligatory in Majang – single referents require a singular
form, and multiple referents require a plural form. Almost every noun is
clearly identifiable for its number value. Most nouns have a singular root and
a marked plural, but for some it is the other way around. For a number of
nouns both forms are morphologically marked. Some nouns only come in
either a singular or a plural form, and for a few nouns number marking hap-
pens through suppletion. Majang therefore clearly exhibits the – according to
Dimmendaal (2000, p. 216) – prototypical number-marking characteristics
of a Nilo-Saharan language.
Which form of number marking is chosen for each noun seems to be mostly
a lexical decision. But, as Unseth (1988b, p. 79) points out, “some generali-
zations concerning various plural noun classes are noticeable. Some of the
plural classes are grouped by phonological criteria and others by semantic
150                                 Chapter IV.1criteria.” Such generalizations, however, are not more than tendencies, and
if such tendencies are observable for a particular marker, they are indicated
in the section dealing with this marker.
As a basis for all numerical information given in the sections below, 719
nouns were analyzed for their number-marking behavior.","[154, 155, 156]"
"
IV.3.9.2 Adverbial conjunction
In the Majang language many clause-level adverbials are not case-marked
noun phrases or prepositional phrases, but mini-clauses which consist of no
more than a verb, stative verb or numeral, and which are not treated as inde-
pendent clauses. They clearly are placed in the adverbial slot of the clause
and are introduced by the clause-internal conjunction à. These adverbials
have a very different status from the adverbial clauses presented in section
V.8.3. For example they can never precede the clause they belong to.
Example IV.299: clause-internal conjunction used for adverbials
   a) àdàràt, ìn táL gàɓɛL à òmóŋL!

adverbial consisting of a stative verb (see section IV.2.4.2 for this construc-
tion) and in c) it almost serves like a preposition introducing a comitative
NP. All three examples have in common that the adverbial phrase introduced
by the conjunction à appears at the end of the total clause, where one would
expect adverbial information.

Part V: Other Syntactic and Pragmatic TopicsThis part of the language description deals with the use of the various forms
explored in the previous sections, focusing on what they accomplish mostly
from a functional perspective. Section V.1 investigates the structure of the
noun phrase, and section V.2 does the same for verb phrases. In section V.3,
the structure of the various kinds of simple clauses is presented, and section
V.4 surveys the semantic functions of various noun phrases. Sections V.5 to
V.6 briefly deal with further syntactic topics (valence-changing construc-
tions and tense, aspect and mode). Section V.7 lists a number of pragmatical-
ly marked structures, such as fronting, negation, questions, focus and imper-
atives. Section V.8 investigates the various ways to combine clauses to com-
plex sentences, and section V.9 addresses topics relating to topical continuity
and discontinuity.","[332, 333, 334, 335]"

II.1.3 Vowel length
Vowel length plays an important role in Majang. This is typologically quite
different from the Southeast-Surmic languages, which seem to make use of
vowel length only sparingly; in both Mursi and Suri, the few long vowels are
attributed to the loss of intervocalic consonants (Bryant, 2013, p. 28f; Mütze,
2014, p. 39f). The distinction between long and short vowels cannot be ana-
lyzed in these terms in Majang. It is frequently used and lexically
contrastive, as can be easily confirmed by numerous minimal pairs:
Example II.2: short and long vowels
     a) ùteŋ      {ùt-ɛ=ŋ} he drinks     vs.    ùːtéŋ {ùːt-ɛ=ŋ}    it rusts
     b) olàn      {olàn}     husband     vs.    óːlánL {óːl-ànL}    be able (INF)
     c) gɔ̀gɔ̀j    {gɔ̀gɔ̀j}   he crawls   vs.    gɔ̀ːgɔ̀j {gɔ̀ːgɔ̀j}  ford
     d) tàjàːŋ   {tàj-à=ŋ} I open      vs.    tàːjáːŋ {tàːj-á=ŋ} I harvest
     e) kɛtɛŋ      {kɛt-ɛ=ŋ} he cuts       vs.    kɛːtɛŋ {kɛːt-ɛ=ŋ} he scatters
     f) menɛŋ      {men-ɛ=ŋ} he twists     vs.    meːnɛŋ {meːn-ɛ=ŋ} he steers
     g) ín        {ín}       HORT        vs.    íːn     {íːn}      you
In phonetic terms, the length difference can be quite pronounced. The fol-
lowing two charts show the words of example II.2a) with the duration of
their first vowel measured. The vowel in question is shaded.
                                     Vowels                                  57
               Figure 4: duration of short vowel in ùtéŋ ‘he drinks’
                Figure 5: duration of long vowel in ùːtéŋ ‘it rusts’In these recordings, which were made on separate occasions, the duration of
the long vowel (about 140 ms) is almost twice as long as the duration of the
short vowel (about 75 ms). This evidence might tempt the observer to the
conclusion that vowel length is a clear-cut phonological feature that speakers
of Majang can always safely discern. But this is not the case. Already the
data in example II.2 shows that lexical minimal pairs based on vowel length
can only be found involving word-initial syllables. The situation with non-
initial syllables gives rise to the suspicion that vowel length may be less dis-
tinctive beyond the first syllable, except possibly as a device for grammatical
distinctions (see examples II.3-II.5). Although for example II.2 a) all
58                              Chapter II.1speakers would readily agree that the first vowel in ‘drink’ is short, and in
‘rust’ it is long, there are some suffixes where the evidence is less clear. For
example, regarding the 1S suffixes -à and -à, my consultants sometimes pro-
nounced them long, sometimes short. In the same way other suffixes, usually
those ending in a vowel, had conflicting length evaluations. A good example
of that is the impersonal suffix -ɛː, for which the consultants insisted on a
long vowel for most words. In some cases, however, they would always tell
me to transcribe it as a short vowel, as in ríjɛL ‘he is called’. In other cases
where the consultants insist on a short vowel, it can clearly be seen that the
vowel goes back to a long vowel underlyingly. This is the case with the short
version of the TF.3S suffix -geːɗ, which is -geL according to the perception of
the speakers. Similar evidence can be found for the infinitive markers -ɛːL
and -íːL, which again are truncated versions of a sequence of long vowel
plus /ɗ/ (see section IV.2.2.1 for more details). Indeed the phonetic evidence
is inconclusive, as the duration of these vowels is somewhere in the span be-
tween 80 and 110 ms, as in the following illustration of the word tònúrgéL
‘he shouted at them’, taken from a recorded text.","[62, 63, 64]"
"As seen in these examples, transitive clauses can come in various configura-
tions, depending on the factors explored in section V.3.1 and particularly in
Part III: Basic Syntax. Example a) has an ergative-absolutive configuration,
whereas the other examples either have no overt A (c and e), or the A is in
the nominative. The A is preposed in examples b) and d), and the P is left-
dislocated in example e). Example c), with the verb phrase immediately fol-
lowed by the absolutive P, has a conjoint form, whereas the other examples
use disjoint forms. What all these examples have in common is that there is
always an overt P in the absolutive case (or the clause would not be transi-
tive), and that an A, if overtly present, always precedes the P (see section
V.7.3 for exceptions to this based on focality). Other clause constituents,
such as the dative-allative noun in example c), always follow both A and P.
The complex case system of Majang, influenced by the factor of topicality,
leads to the question of whether bivalent constructions are all equally transi-
tive, or some are more transitive than others. They are certainly coded in dif-
ferent ways. When a nominally transitive action is seen as non-telic or non-
punctual, a plain verb is turned into a derived imperfective verb stem. These
in turn tend to have a non-individuated object, which is easily left out
through the antipassive derivation:
Example V.48: transitivity decreased by non-telic and non-punctual action
   ...máL cɛnkL kúꜜrój ɗáɗámíːL càːdí.
   máL cɛnkL       kúꜜrój          ɗáɗám-iːL càːdí
   but 3S.CONTR donkey\SG.ABS eat\IPFV-AP.3S there
   ...but he, Donkey, was eating there.
354                              Chapter V.3In this example, the non-telic and non-punctual action on a non-individuated
object ensures the use of the antipassive derivation on an imperfective verb
stem. This construction displays considerably less transitivity than any of the
clauses in example V.47.
Drossard (1991, p. 411), following and extending Tsunoda (1981), estab-
lished a differentiated scale of semantic verb classes based on Hopper &
Thompson’s (1980, p. 253f) factor of affectedness of the object. Verbs like
kill and destroy maximally affect the object and therefore are maximally
transitive. Other transitive verbs merely impact the object, like beat. Others
leave the object fully unaffected, like verbs of perception, or emotional verbs
like love or envy. Finally, some verbs requiring two participants are hardly
perceived to entail any semantic transfer, such as imitate or resemble. Many
verbs of these semantic classes behave like regular transitive verbs:
Example V.49: verbs with less affected objects
   a) ɗɛjɛ íɗíL gode.
      ɗɛj-ɛ         íɗíL   gode
      want-3S.DJ man\SG.NOM house\SG.ABS
      The man wants a house.

      see-3P.DJ lion-PL.ERG    man\SG.ABS
      Lions see a man.","[359, 360]"
"
Other verbal conjugations for stative verbs
Majang stative verbs were almost always encountered in simple paradigms,
involving neither directional nor subordinate verb form markings. But this
tendency does not amount to an exclusion. One example was found in the
text corpus in which a stative verb is used both in the centripetal form and in
the relative-past subordinate form:

Semantics of tense markers
Only five different tense markers were found to follow the verb as part of the
verb phrase: ɓàL ‘remote past (REMPST)’, kànL ‘medium past (MEDPST)’, kɔ̀ ‘re-
cent past (RECPST)’, kɔ̀ːL ‘near future (NFUT)’ and koj ‘distant future (DFUT)’.
Bender (1983, p. 133) listed three more markers (kɔ̀ːt, ɓòŋ and ɗi), but he
could not provide good evidence for their use, nor were they encountered in
my data. Getachew (2014, p. 159ff) and Unseth (2007, p. 628) both restrict-
ed their inventory to the five markers listed here, so there is good agreement
that they belong to a closed class. Their glosses were taken from Bender’s,
Unseth’s and Getachew’s descriptions, and they served well for analyzing
the text corpus for this study. Tense in Majang therefore appears to be
metrical, in the sense that the time around the temporal reference point (the
time of the utterance) is divided up into somewhat unspecific domains of in-
creasing distance to the reference point. When I asked my consultants about
what the individual markers are used for, they came up with specific time
frames, like “several years ago” for ɓàL, “a few days ago at most” for kɔ̀,
                              Other Word Classes                            311etc. The fact that Majang provides more past markers than future tense mark-
ers is quite in line with descriptions of metrical tense in other languages
(Chung & Timberlake, 1985, p. 209).
Still, from looking at the examples in the texts, this neat metrical categoriza-
tion of tense appears to be doubtful. For example in the story of Dog and
Donkey (see p. 415), the tense marker ɓàL is used throughout the story for re-
ferring to main-line actions. Then, following the climax, where Dog unex-
pectedly kills Hyena, the narrative switches to the tense marker kànL (which,
interestingly, was called narrative past by Bender, although it is not used
much elsewhere within my text collection). There is no reason to assume that
from this point in the narrative the reported events are significantly closer to
the time of the telling of the story; therefore it is very likely that the marker
    L
kàn serves some other purpose than just being a medium-past marker.
In the same way, the two future-tense markers may be less characterized by
a difference in temporal distance than in probability. Of the 16 examples
found in my texts using the tense marker kój, almost every single one is used
either in a question or in a purpose clause:
Example IV.264: use of distant-future marker kój
   a) nɛ cɛ*ːn cìnì kój ŋǎːrkíɗ …
      nɛ      cɛ*ːn   cì-n-ì     kój    ŋǎːr-kí-ɗ

Regular personal pronouns
Regular personal pronouns are inflected for person, number and case. As
shown below, for pronouns the language does not use the ergative-absolu-
tive-nominative distinction seen elsewhere in the language. There is only one
unmarked set for A, S and P pronouns. The cases that are marked on person-
al pronouns beyond this basic set are dative and locative.
It is very difficult to obtain examples of A pronouns, both in the text corpus
or through elicitation. The only two instances of bivalent verbs with pre-
posed A pronouns are seen here:
Example IV.208: preposed A-pronouns
  a) nɛ kɔ̀ cɛːg àmbàbɛr cìgéːgéL kánL ɟéːmɛk joː?

List of bound morphemes
The following is an alphabetic list of all bound morphemes of the Majang
language, as encountered in this work. V in a prefix stands for the first stem
vowel in a total vowel harmony context. In a suffix it refers to the class vow-
el of the verb (à, ɛ, or i). The following tonal conventions are used to refer to
the underlying tone of the morpheme:
          •   -i (no tone indicated): a toneless morpheme – the morpheme copies
              the previous tone.
          •   -í:, the morpheme takes the polar (opposite) tone of the previous
              tone.
          •   -í: the morpheme’s high tone replaces all other tones on the stem.
In brackets for each morpheme a reference points to the relevant lowest-level
numbered section where information on this morpheme is given.

Introduction
      “Grammar and discourse interact with and influence each
      other in profound ways at all levels, so that in real life neither
      can even be accessed, not to mention explained, without refer-
      ence to the other.”
This statement by John Du Bois (2003, p. 49) may serve as a fitting tag-line
for this language description, which provides much justification to his idea.
The past few years of my attempts to first understand and then describe the
structure of the Majang language were deeply impacted by this interaction
between grammar and discourse. The project began with a tone workshop
under the guidance of Keith Snider and Constance Kutsch Lojenga in Addis
Ababa in 2008; there I became convinced that another description of the
Majang language would add value to the efforts of previous and contempo-
rary linguists, simply because my newly gained understanding of the tone
system would give me a considerable advantage that was not available to
them. With this confidence about tonal differences, I felt that I could open
doors into the inner systems of the grammar by identifying all the categories
that so far were not described by my colleagues.
I started by analyzing a substantial word list, and then worked on simple
narrative texts. They revealed that Majang had very little to offer in the way
of case marking, as most central constituents appeared to be unmarked for
case. After some time I started branching out from the texts by eliciting fur-
ther data, and this was the first time that it dawned on me that things might
become more complicated. The consultant at that time returned completely
unexpected tone patterns to me, both on verbs and nouns, so that after a few
days of this I falsely concluded that I could not trust his data and decided not
to work with him again. What is worse, I went through the data I collected
from him and corrected it to the way I thought it had to be, because it just
did not fit my assumptions.
Next then came another workshop, this time about grammar, which was
based entirely on elicited material gleaned from a number of motivated lan-
guage consultants. After a short time with these men it became very clear
that the Majang language had a surprise in store for me that I did not expect
to find in an African language – a full-blown ergative-absolutive alignment
system, probably the most robust specimen encountered so far in any lan-
guage on the continent. I went through my text corpus again to change all the
30                                 Introductionglosses according to this new discovery, correcting all the data where I must
have misheard things initially. Unfortunately, I ran into more and more diffi-
culties with this, as rather a lot of the early transcriptions did not quite fit the
new revelation.
Some elicited data finally made me aware that there must be some split sys-
tem regarding intransitive subjects. Often they came out with different cases
than the absolutive I expected, and I presented this as some kind of split-S or
fluid-S system at the 2015 Nilo-Saharan colloquium in Nairobi. Later, I
checked my data again and discovered what seemed closer to the truth, a
split-ergativity system based on the pragmatic parameter of topicality, which
fits very well into the framework provided by typologists (section III.2.1.2).
Then going through the tedious job of checking all the paradigms of nouns
encountered in my texts, I made the startling discovery that, with very few
exceptions, ergativity did not appear in any of the texts. I was looking at a
language with two faces – one with a vibrant ergative-absolutive nature
jumping at me from all my elicited grammar data, and another one stubborn-
ly aligned along nominative-accusative characteristics in my texts.
There are explanations for these two natures, grounded in the aforemention-
ed interaction between discourse and grammar. In the discussions that follow
I hope that I do this language justice. One thing I have learned in the process
of preparing this grammar: whatever the linguist finds out depends to a great
extent on the nature of the available data. Had I followed the advice of only
looking at data from natural texts, I would probably not have encountered
the ergative-absolutive nature of this language. Had I only restricted myself
to elicited data, I would not have realized how marginal the structures are in
the language, at least in the kinds of text that are usually analyzed by lingu-
ists. I am grateful that somehow I stumbled across the most felicitous mix.
This Majang grammar was written for linguists. This means that it is not par-
ticularly useful or even readable for those who want to learn the language, or
for linguistically untrained members of the Majang language community.
Other resources need to be (and hopefully will be) written for them. At least
it is my hope that this language description can serve as a resource for those
who will be creating such works of a less technical and more practical na-
ture. Reading this grammar requires a minimum of linguistic training, which
encompasses familiarity with the terms provided by what is called Basic
Linguistic Theory. This concept is now readily accessible in the three vol-
umes of the same name by Dixon (2010a, 2010b, 2012). Following the con-
                                  Introduction                                31cept of Basic Linguistic Theory entails the commitment to disregard any
particular contemporary grammatical theory or model in its current special-
ized terminology or formal representation, or to at least reduce it to a mini-
mum. The idea is that even in generations to come, linguists and typologists
will be able to make use of this description without having to first go
through a course on the intricacies of linguistics in the early 21 st century. I
hope to accomplish this goal by providing sufficient definitions for all ter-
minology that is not part of Basic Linguistic Theory, and by refraining from
any kind of formal representation that is not self-explanatory. Contemporary
readers who hope to find explanations and representations according to the
latest models will therefore be predictably disappointed. All in all, the focus
is mostly on description, and much less so on explanation.
For the most part, I also refrain from historical statements, and I take no part
in any discussion regarding the placement of Majang or any other higher-
level language family unit in any kind of genetic classification. Where the
presented data supports or contradicts any existing classification, I say so,
but without drawing any further conclusions.
This language description comes in several parts. The division into parts is
inspired by the ideas of both T. Payne (2006) and Noonan (2006), who en-
visioned the development of user-friendly grammars as coming from two
perspectives: one a form-to-function approach, and the other a function-to-
form approach. Although this division could not be upheld entirely, these
two approaches are reflected in Part IV: Morphology and Part V: Other
Syntactic and Pragmatic Topics of this language description. But I found it
necessary to add a third part preceding these two perspectives which deals
with the basic facts behind information packaging in the clause (Part III:
Basic Syntax). This is the shortest of the parts in this work, but it introduces
many of the concepts in both form and function that accompany the reader in
all the following sections. It also discusses my choices regarding analysis
and terminology, and explains why some alternative approaches were not
pursued in the interpretation of certain language structures. In a sense Part III
can be seen as the central chapter of the whole description.
Further elements necessary for a helpful language description are found in
the other parts. Part I: The Cultural, Ecological and Sociolinguistic Context
not only provides demographic, ethnographic and sociolinguistic informa-
tion on the Majang language and the people who speak it; it also gives de-
tails on sources and history of this study, and the people involved in it. It fur-
32                              Introductionther contains a short typological summary (section I.11) of the language.
Part II: Phonological Inventory and Orthography presents the findings of
the phonological analysis, which is an integral part of this study, together
with much of the data that underpins these findings. It also explains the par-
ticulars of the practical orthography used in this language description.
After the main grammar parts III-V, Part VI: Texts and Lexicon provides
two word lists, one from Majang to English and one from English to Majang,
to give an impression of the Majang lexicon. This is preceded by two sample
narrative texts, which show the language in natural use.
It is my sincere hope that the index provided at the end enhances the useful-
ness of the grammar to those who do not have the time to read this work
from beginning to end, since this usually describes the largest group of
grammar users.

Part I: The Cultural, Ecological and
Sociolinguistic ContextI.1 The Name of the LanguageThe Majang language, a Nilo-Saharan language spoken in southwest Ethio-
pia, has been given many names; see Dimmendaal (1998b, p. 26ff) for a list
of names of all Surmic languages. The following are the names listed there
for the Majang language: Ajo, Ato Majangeronk (self-name, means ‘mouth
of Majang people’), Mageno, Majangir, Majanjiro, Mezhenger, Masongo,
Mesengo, Ojang and Tama. As seen in section I.3.1, the variety of names has
led to some confusion regarding the 2007 Ethiopian census.
The only names applied to the Majang people nowadays are based on the
(closely related) variants Majang, Mesengo and Mezhenger. Since these are
different orthographic representations of the self-name, they do not cause
any offense to the Majang people. I am not aware of any derogatory names
currently applied to the Majang people.
In this study, I use the name Majang language, or, in short, Majang.
The ISO 639-3 code for Majang is mpe. WALS (Dryer & Haspelmath, 2013)
uses the code maj, and Glottolog1 the glottocode maja1242.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]"

needs to be re-established, for example after a change of subject, place or
time. In these cases the A or S usually does not follow the verb, but precedes

constituents).

In these clauses, the A is invariably marked by the nominative case and is
just as invariably preposed. Having an alternative AVP structure is not unex-
pected according to Greenberg’s prediction that “all languages with domi-
nant VSO order have SVO as an alternative or as the only alternative basic
order” (Greenberg, 1966, p. 110). But Unseth was not able to confirm this
prediction based on elicitation (1989b, p. 109):
          “Deliberate attempts to elicit other word orders by topicaliza-
          tion did not produce any variants. Some SVO clauses were oc-
          casionally elicited at other times, such as in subordinate
          clauses […]. My Majang helper consistently rejected the SOV
          [sic!]43 examples in Bender’s article [...].”
This experience is a strong indication that the VAP order of constituents has
a firm psychological standing in the mental grammar of Majang speakers.
Although the AVP order has a high functional load in the syntax of the
language for re-establishing accessible participants, it is not something the
speakers have a conscious awareness of. Therefore mother-tongue translators
will have to be trained in the pragmatic significance of this structure, so that
43
     This is a typo in Unseth (1989). Bender (1983, p. 128f) presents rather unnatural AVP
     examples.
130                              Chapter III.2they can apply it appropriately without being unduly guided by the structure
of the source language.
Fronting the A-constituent to re-activate an accessible participant has striking
similarities with what has been observed as word-order alternations in other
related Eastern-Sudanic languages. For example, A-constituents in South-
east-Surmic Suri-Tirmaga (Bryant, 1999, p. 45ff), Western-Nilotic Päri
(Andersen, 1988, p. 293f) and Southwest-Surmic Baale (Moges & Dimmen-
daal, 1998, p. 297) are case-marked when appearing in post-verbal position,
but unmarked when in pre-verbal position. These languages have in common
that they place the unmarked or absolutive S preceding the verb. It would
therefore be tempting to describe Majang in similar terms, where the pre-
verbal position is the place to show all constituents in unmarked or neutral
case, and contrast these forms with the constituents found in the post-verbal
position, where the A-constituents are case-marked, either with the nomina-
tive or ergative case, depending on the other findings in the language. It is
probably such a perspective that prompted the previous analysis of Majang
as a marked-nominative language (König, 2008, p. 191).
But the data presented so far makes it clear that the situation is quite dif fer-
ent from that found in marked-nominative languages such as Suri-Tirmaga
or Baale. The case marking of pre-verbal constituents can in no way be cha-
racterized as neutral or unmarked, as it is different from the absolutive case
of postverbal P- or S-constituents. The following observations can be made
about the pre-verbal position:
      •   Ergative-marked constituents cannot be fronted.
      •   The absolutive case cannot be found in pre-verbal position, except
          when accompanying a co-referential contrastive pronoun (see exam-
          ple IV.219). Absolutive case forms further appear in left-dislocated
          position (see section V.7.1.2), but these are syntactically different
          from fronting, as left-dislocated material is placed outside the clause.
      •   Accordingly, only nominative-marked constituents are found in pre-
          verbal position.
      •   No fronting was observed in any natural clause that does not also
          have some other pre-verbal material – at least a conjunction, fre-
          quently a tense marker and sometimes adverbial material. Elicited
          clauses with a nominative S and without an initial conjunction al-
          ways have the S following the verb.
                    Case Marking on Central Constituents                  131    •   Elicited transitive clauses with postverbal nominative A were reject-
        ed by the consultants. The only corpus occurrence is a narrative-text
        subordinate clause, seen in example V.125.
The nominative case is therefore by no means restricted to the preverbal po-
sition – nominative-marked S-constituents and subjects of speech clauses are
frequently placed after the verb. It is therefore not possible to consider the
nominative form a pre-verbal allomorph of the absolutive form, as nomi-
native and absolutive S contrast in the postverbal position (as in example
III.13).
In summary, it is not possible to transfer the findings in other Eastern-
Sudanic marked-nominative languages as a possible explanation for the situ-
ation in Majang. The pre-verbal appearances of S or A are not unmarked for
case, and they are not positional variants of the post-verbal absolutive case.","[134, 135, 136, 137]"

V.7.1 Constituent order variation
The basic constituent order of Majang was introduced in section III.2.2.1 as
verb – A/S – P – complements and adjuncts, with a preverbal slot that con-
tains any temporal information of the simple clause. But it was also seen that
A and S constituents can be preposed to the preverbal position to re-activate
the participants (see section III.2.2.2).
More fronting happens with noun phrases marked as contrastive topics, even
beyond the subject.

"In this example, the auxiliary verb óːl ‘can’ is used in the negative form
     L
óːlɛː . This needs to be preceded by the negative auxiliary k-, which is in this
context used in its 1S form kà. Negative verb forms cannot be used without
such a preceding negative auxiliary.
It appears that the negative verb formation is based on the formation of infi-
nitives. For almost half of all the verbs in the sample, the form of the infini-
tive is identical in all respects to the negative form. This is particularly true
for most of the verbs forming their infinitive with the suffixes -ɛːt and -iːt.
All the verbs forming their infinitives with -iːt do the same for the negative
verb form. Of all the verbs forming their infinitive with -ɛːt, only nine do not
use this marker for the negative. One of these, with the infinitive làptɛːt ‘to
die’, uses the suffix -ànL for the negative làptànL. The other eight use the
suffix -iːt, which is regularly used for all ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs ending with the
detransitivizing marker -ɗiːL.

                       ɛ-class verb suffixes   moɗɛː       moɗíːtL       burn
The last two of these examples show high-toned base stems, which form
their infinitives regularly with -ɛːL. They, too, end their negative forms on
    L
-iːt , which copies the root tone and is followed by a floating L. It is difficult
to determine whether this is the same suffix as the -iːt of i-class verbs, or an-
other suffix -tL just used for the negative form. A suffix -tL is also used for
the six verbs using the durative stem extension -àː, such as rɔ̀ːríjàː ‘teach’, in-
finitive rɔ̀ːríjɔ̀nL, negative rɔ̀ːríjàːtL. Other high-toned negative -iːtL markers
are found on five a-class verbs, such as ɗegeger ‘agree’, infinitive ɗegeger,
negative ɗegegeríːt.
The verbs that form their infinitives with -ɛːL or -íːL (and that don’t pick the
same marker for the negative) have an almost identical negative form -ɛːɗ

the absolutive form of the infinitive. If the implosive is not dropped, then the
final H is realized as a HL sequence. In any case, all other tones on the stem
are replaced by a H that spreads across the whole word.

In the same way, the suffix set -ànL/-ɔ̀nL is not only used for the infinitive,
but also for negative verbs, although in smaller numbers than the previously
mentioned suffixes. Only seven i-class verbs use it for the negative, whereas
the other eleven i-class verbs which use -ànL for the infinitive instead use -ɛːL
for the negative. Another 16 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs use -ànL for both the infinitive and
the negative, and 14 more use -ɛːL for the negative. In the a-class, six verbs
use -ànL and its tonal varieties for both the infinitive and the negative, and
seven more use -ɛːL for the negative instead of -ànL. Among these are some
low-toned manifestations of the marker -ɛːL.

The marker -ɔ̀nL of the infinitive is applied for the negative with a slight
tonal variation as -ɔ̀n for nine a-class verbs. For ten more a-class verbs it is

The tV-prefix infinitives almost all use similar forms for the negative, but
they often involve slight changes to the stem vowel or to the tone. The only
two tV-infinitives using a different marker are tegeɟL ‘to prepare’ with the
negative keːɟíːtL, and tɔ̀kɔ̀ɲL ‘to persuade’ with the negative kɔ̀ɲɛːɗ.

nitive:

The infinitive and the negative forms can be derived from practically all verb
stems, and they lead to verbal nouns which are used in certain grammatical
contexts. These are, according to Comrie and Thompson (1985, p. 350ff),
action/state nominalizations. But, beyond these two forms, there are other
ways to derive nouns from verbs with a more lexicalized meaning, called
argument nominalizations by Comrie and Thompson. They (1985, pp. 351–
357) sub-categorize this kind of nominalization into a number of more de-
tailed types, such as agentive nominalization, objective nominalization, in-
strument nominalization, and locative nominalization. In Majang, there is no
one-to-one correlation between these nominalization types and any of the
various nominalization forms introduced in the following sections.","[226, 227, 228, 229]"

                   Case Marking on Central Constituents                    119DeLancey’s (1981, p. 653) distinction between starting-point and viewpoint
could also be considered as a cognitive perspective describing the split in
Majang. The viewpoint in his model always comes from a topical/referential
position, whereas the starting-point in a transitive proposition would usually
be the agent. DeLancey states (p. 653): “Ergative case marking labels the
starting-point when it is not also the viewpoint. When viewpoint and start-
ing-point coincide, the NP is not marked for case.” This may well be the
situation in Majang; but then one needs to see the nominative case as less
marked or even unmarked compared to the ergative case. This is somewhat
problematic, as both forms are identical for modified nouns. But at least for
unmodified nouns the ergative appears indeed to be more marked by the ad-
dition of a low tone or a HL tone sequence.
More promisingly, research on Tibeto-Burman languages has shown that
discourse-pragmatic factors often play a role in what previously was called
“optional” ergative case assignment (Saxena, 1991; Tournadre, 1991;
DeLancey, 2011). DeLancey (p. 13f) observes that the
      “[…] missing piece is the pragmatic force of emphasis or con-
      trast which is associated with ergative marking. Saxena notes
      that […] ergative marking [...] cannot be omitted in text exam-
      ples where the O argument has been marked as a topic by front-
      ing. Tournadre [...] points out that there is no syntactic en-
      vironment where ergative is truly obligatory, and that wherever
      it occurs it indicates contrastive focus.”
This, of course, is a different situation from Majang, where the ergative
marking is not connected to contrastive focus, but conditioned by the ab-
sence or a low degree of topicality. A parallel situation is found in the Aus-
tralian language Warrwa, for which McGregor (2010, p. 1622ff) interprets
the absence of ergative marking to signify that the agent is high in agentivity
and expected in the context (p. 1622f). He goes on to suggest the features
prominence or givenness to account for the absence or presence of the erga-
tive case in optionally ergative languages, encompassing the semantic con-
cept of agentivity and the pragmatic concept of expectedness. On p. 1625,
McGregor prefers to link Blake’s concept of topic-worthiness to the feature
backgrounded, which he envisions to be contextualized as topicality in some
languages. The situation in Tibeto-Burman and Australian languages there-
fore firmly establishes pragmatics as a conditioning factor for case-marking
systems, and DeLancey (2011, p. 11) evaluates this discourse-pragmatic in-
fluence as so pervasive in Tibeto-Burman languages that he thinks it unrea-
120                              Chapter III.2listic that all this similarly motivated case-marking variability can be ex-
plained by diachronic alignment shifts caused by the innovation of new case
markers – an idea proposed, for example, in section 2 of Cristofaro (2012).
Givón’s, Blake’s, McGregor’s, T. Payne’s, Du Bois’ and DeLancey’s work
provide a reference frame within which Majang’s topicality-based system
can be described. The topical/non-topical distinction correlates in many
ways with Dixon’s nominal hierarchy and with Givón’s referentiality/topi-
cality scale, Blake’s topic-worthiness, and Du Bois’ preferred argument
structure. A split system based on topicality as a simplified criterion could
therefore easily be conceived. This is further confirmed by the state of affairs
in Eastern-Sudanic Päri (Andersen, 1988, p. 294), where the topicalization of
A results in the loss of ergative marking.
So far only AS were looked at relating to this split. An S can be marked by
both the absolutive (if non-topical) and the nominative (if topical).
Example III.13: marking of non-topical and topical S
   a) nɛ mɛlkì ɗúmáːtL wàː.
      nɛ    mɛl-kì          ɗúmáːtL     wàː
      conj arrive-CP.3S.CJ owner\SG.ABS house\SG.DAT
      The owner came home.
   b) nɛ cáːL ɓáL mɛlkíɗL ɗúmáL wàː...
      nɛ     cáːL ɓáL       mɛl-kí-ɗL            ɗúmáL        wàː
      conj then REMPST arrive-CP-RELPST.3S        owner\SG.NOM house\SG.DAT
      After the owner came home…
Both sentences (both from the same narrative in short proximity to each
other) are semantically almost identical, except that the first clause is a main
clause, and the second a temporal adverbial clause. But there is the pragma-
tic difference that in a) the S is introduced as a new participant to the narra-
tive and therefore not topical, but in b) it is, as the S had just been made
accessible through clause a). This difference causes the variation in case
marking on the NP (visible in the different stem forms of the same lexeme
‘owner’).
PS at first glance always look the same, regardless of their topicality status,
but this identity of case marking is accompanied by a different syntactic be-
havior. This can be seen from the following set of examples, again gleaned
from a single narrative. Both examples show the noun for ‘mother’, but a) in
non-topical use, and b) in topical use.
                          Case Marking on Central Constituents               121Example III.14: marking of non-topical and topical PS
      a) nɛ kɛː làŋkì ɛmɛc L lɛːrà.
         nɛ kɛː       làŋ-kì        ɛmɛcL       lɛːr-à
         CONJ go\3S find-CP.3S.CJ mother\SG.ABS Leer-DAT
         He went to find Leer’s mother.
      b) mà ɓòkòtú ɛmɛcL lɛːrǎːŋ.
         mà ɓòkòt-í        ɛmɛcL         lɛːr-à=ŋ
         CONJ kill-3S.DJ   mother\SG.ABS Leer-DAT=SFT
         But he killed Leer’s mother.
In example a), Leer’s mother had been mentioned in the preceding context,
but is in this clause encountered after a change of place and time, and ac-
cordingly is not an expected participant. The thus non-topical P therefore
triggers the conjoint marking (see section III.3) on the immediately preced-
ing verb (example III.14a). Topical PS also come in the absolutive case, but
don’t meet the condition for conjoint marking on the preceding verb; instead
they create the condition that allows the placement of the SFT-clitic (see sec-
tion III.4) on the NP at the end of a sentence (example b). This clause fol-
lows clause a) after a short time in the same narrative.
It can therefore be observed that in Majang the discourse-pragmatic factor of
topicality accounts for a change of case for A and S, but it leaves the case of
P intact. The topicality of P is shown by other means.
Because it was shown for other languages that it is rather the discourse-prag-
matic factor of focus or focality that prompts the assignment of the ergative
case to otherwise unmarked NPs, it needs to be shown here why this analysis
has been discarded for Majang in favor of the assignment of the nominative
case for topical constituents – the non-elicited NPs with ergative case in ex-
amples III.9b) and III.10) could indeed be seen as focal in their pragmatic
contexts. Two reasons speak against the idea of ergative marking for focal
constituents: first, the ergative-marked NP in example III.9a) plus practically
all elicited examples of ergative case provide no contextual evidence that
any focality attaches to the NP in question 38. Indeed, the fact that all elicited
transitive clauses have A marked by the ergative makes any analysis of the
ergative case as the focal case very unlikely – there is no reason to assume
that in every elicited transitive clause each A defaults to focus marking. It
would be more natural to expect focally unmarked As in elicited clauses.","[124, 125, 126, 127]"

IV.3.5 Auxiliaries
There are not many auxiliaries in the Majang language. Auxiliaries are
lexically empty verbs whose purpose is to provide the grammatical
information needed for another verb that comes in a reduced grammatical
shape, but that provides the semantic content to the proposition (T. Payne,
1997, p. 84).
The morpheme that fits this definition best is the negative auxiliary k- that is
needed to precede the negative verb forms introduced in section IV.2.2.1.
Whereas the negative verb form is unchanged for all persons, the subject
information is provided by the negative auxiliary.
The negative auxiliary, just like verbs, has different endings for the 1 st, 2nd
and 3rd person in the singular and plural:
314                                  Chapter IV.3Example IV.268: conjugation of the negative auxiliary
   1S kà pàːkkà        I am not hot
   2S kín pàːkkà       you are not hot
                              SG
   3S kí pàːkkà        it is not hot
   1P kíː pàːkkà       we are not hot
   2P kí *ːr pàːkkà    you are not hot
                              PL
   3P kír pàːkkà       they are not hot
Unseth (1989a, p. 119) recorded the negative marker as kù-, which is pro-
bably a dialectal variation that I did not encounter during my data collection.
Getachew (2014, p. 177ff) seems to have recorded the negative marker with-
out the vowel /ù/.
The negative auxiliary can undergo further inflection than just the bare per-
son suffixes seen above. It can appear with the impersonal marker:
Example IV.269: impersonal negative auxiliary
   máL tɛːnàn ɟéːmɛL kɛːL rɔ̀ːríjáːtìŋ.
   máL tɛːnàn     ɟéːmɛL         k-ɛːL  rɔ̀ːríjáːtìŋ
   but instead previously NEG-IMPS teach\NEG
   But they were not previously taught.
Furthermore, the negative auxiliary is also the carrier of any directional in-
flection marking:
Example IV.270: negative auxiliary with centripetal inflection
   kìːkíːL túːkɛːL ɟóːpL ɔ̀gɔ̀ wàlɛc.
   k-ìːk-í ,ːL túːk-ɛːL ɟóːpL        ɔ̀gɔ̀ wàlɛc
   NEG-CP-1P join-NEG people\ABS.MOD other from.outside
   We don’t join with other outside people.
The following are the negative auxiliaries with direction markings:

ary:

city to do something. It is inflected as an ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verb.
Example IV.273: auxiliary oːl ‘can’
   óːlùn típír à éːkeːr.
   óːl-ìn      tí-pír       à    éːk-eːr
   can-2S.CJ INF-fly\ABS.SG CONJ truth-PL.ABS
   You can truly fly!
As seen here, this auxiliary is followed by an infinitive verb form.
Furthermore there are a few verbs which can serve as full verbs in some con-
texts, but which can also serve as auxiliaries to other verbs, in order to pro-
vide modal or aktionsart information.
The first of these is the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verb ɗɛj with the meaning ‘want’ and ‘need’.
This is used to indicate deontic or optative mode to a proposition. If so, then
the other verb appears in the infinitive form:
Example IV.274: ɗɛj as an auxiliary
   a) ɔ̀kɔ̀n làkɛL ɟóːpL gɔ̀ ɗɛjɛr àmbàbɛːt, ...
      ɔ̀kɔ̀n làk-ɛL          ɟóːpL       gɔ̀      ɗɛj-ɛr     àmbàb-ɛːt

      know\3S.DJ QUOT need-3S.DJ NFUT.CJ give.birth-INF
      She knew that she needed to give birth.
316                               Chapter IV.3The same lexeme is also used as a full transitive verb, with the desired object
in the P slot:
Example IV.275: ɗɛj ‘want’ as a transitive verb
   ɗɛjɛrL màcáːpɛL nɛːk cìnǐŋ joː?
   ɗɛj-ɛrL     màcáːpɛL      nɛːk        cì-n-ì=ŋ      joː
   want-3P.DJ book\SG.ABS POSS\3S.SG.ABS DEM-SG-SP=SFT QUEST
   Do they want this book, or not?","[319, 320, 321, 322]"
"If the SFT-marker were to be used not only at the end of each sentence, but at
the end of each clause that complies with conditions 1 and 2, then one would
expect it in this sentence to show up following ŋàːrkí. But it is not used,
which establishes its role as a sentence-final topicality marker. This know-
ledge helps with parsing strings of main clauses, which in narratives are all
introduced by the ubiquitous conjunction nɛ. Speaker intuition quite often
lumped clauses together into one orthographic sentence which according to
the use of the SFT-marker apparently need to be broken up into two sentences:
Example III.38: the SFT-marker as a sentence recognition device
      máL cɛnkL wárL49 èːŋàɗàːŋ. nɛ èːŋáɗír ɗùŋéɗL à jòwɛːɗíːŋ.
      máL cɛnkL wárL            èːŋàɗáː=ŋ        nɛ èːŋáɗ-ír

      hyena\SG.ABS CONJ far\3S.DJ=SFT
      But dog sniffed. He smelled Hyena far away.
49
     This form could also be the nominative wàr, as the floating L cannot be phonetically estab-
     lished preceding a word beginning with a low tone. But in this syntactic context, accom-
     panying a co-referential contrastive pronoun, only absolutive nouns are encountered.
                    The Sentence-Final Topicality Marker (sft)                             143These two main clauses were originally seen by the informants as being
parts of the same sentence. The use of the SFT-marker following the first
verb, however, does not allow such an interpretation – that text segment
needs to be analyzed as containing two syntactically independent sentences.50
Two additional problems remain with the interpretation of =ŋ as a sentence-
final topicality marker. First, there are a few instances like the following
example where the SFT-marker is used and where absolutely no topical parti-
cipant appears to be involved in the clause. These examples contain imper-
sonal weather or environmental verbs.
Example III.39: further problems with the SFT-marker
     nɛ kɔ̀ɟúrúꜜrúŋ òkó cìnìk
     nɛ     kɔ̀ɟúrúr-í=ŋ            òkó        cì-n-ì-k.
     CONJ become.dark-3S.DJ=SFT like            DEM-SG-SP-POSS
     It became dark, just like this.
This sentence, at first glance, may fit better with the analysis of =ŋ as a
marker for argument indexation only, as proposed in Joswig (2015) – there I
assumed a completely syntactic rule governing its appearance on verb
phrases, whenever no other constituents were present in the sentence. This
analysis made no reference to pragmatic factors, but also had to wrongly
ignore all occurrences of =ŋ on noun phrases. An alternative interpretation,
in line with the idea of =ŋ as a topicality marker, is that weather and en-
vironmental verbs indeed refer to topical entities, that is the weather and the
general environment – the interaction of these with the narrative can be
taken for granted and is grounded in the world-view of the speech-act parti-
cipants.51
Second – and this can be illustrated with the same example III.39 – this
sentence has material following the verb marked by the SFT-marker. Majang
narratives frequently use such expressions which seem to express the attitude
of the narrator (see examples IV.267 and V.138b), and which are usually
translated as ‘just like this’. It might be possible to analyze them as extra-
clausal and even extra-sentence material which is thrown in by the narrator
after the sentence as such is finished, but before the next sentence begins.","[148, 149]"
"
II.6.3 Toneless morphemes and polar tones
Not all morphemes of the Majang language have their own underlying tone.
Although all stem morphemes of Majang and all particles have their own in-
herent tone or tone melody, some suffixes are not specified for tone in the
lexicon.
Example II.32: toneless 3P.DJ morpheme
   a) íbáːlírL          b) làŋír
      {íbáːl-irL}           {làŋ-irL}
      play-3P.DJ             find-3P.DJ
      they play              they findThe 3P.DJ morpheme -irL for the i-class verbs always behaves like in these
examples, and in the same way the 3P.DJ morpheme -ɛrL for the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs.
Following a stem ending in a high tone (example a), it carries a non-down-
stepped high tone. Following a stem ending in a low tone (example b), it car-
ries a low tone. This variation is best explained by a simple tone-spreading
rule which assumes that the suffix is inherently toneless. The morpheme-
downstep rule shown above does not allow the high suffix tone in example
94                                     Chapter II.6a) to be analyzed as an underlying tone, as it would then be downstepped. It
must be analyzed as the same tone as the high tone on the last stem syllable,
spreading over to the suffix.
Example II.33: tone spreading to toneless morphemes
      a) íbáːlírL        b) làŋír
         {íbáːl-irL}         {làŋ-irL}           LH      L            L     L
As can be seen in these examples, the situation is somewhat complicated by
the presence of a floating low tone on many of these toneless morphemes.
This means that when the 3P.DJ suffix -irL copies the preceding stem tone and
this results in a high tone on the suffix, the next word will then be down-
stepped, which implies a word-downstep situation and therefore the involve-
ment of a floating low tone. This is also the case in the following examples:
Example II.34: toneless PL-morpheme -ɛL with floating low tone
      a) kùꜜrojɛL     gàːnk         b) kùtùrɛ     gàːnk
         {kùꜜroj-ɛL}                    {kùtùr-ɛL}
         donkey-PL.ABS POSS\1S.PL.ABS    hog-PL.ABS POSS\1S.PL.ABS
         my donkeys                      my hogsThe plural suffix -ɛL copies the stem tone in both examples a) and b). But in
example a), the high tone on the following possessive pronoun is down-
stepped. Since the tone on the suffix in example b) is already low, no non-
automatic downstep is applied to the following possessive pronoun – the
high tone on gàːŋk is automatically downstepped compared to previous high
tones in the utterance.
This behavior is not what one would expect according to established phono-
logical universals. One of the constraints relating to tone according to Auto-
segmental Phonology is a strong dislike of languages for floating low tones
and for toneless syllables. Such constraints23 can of course be violated, as ap-
parently the Majang language does here, but it is striking to see that in this
situation, there should actually be no need for such a violation. The mor-
pheme -ɛL is a syllable and has an available low tone attached to it; one
23
     Cahill (2004, p. 13) translates Goldsmith’s (1976) Well-Formedness Conditions into Basic
     Tone Mapping (Well-Formedness) Constraints, of which the two constraints *TONELESS and
     *(L) are relevant in evaluating the behavior of Majang.
                                     Tone                                     95would therefore expect that this low tone just becomes associated with the
syllable, in this way eliminating the offending presence of both the toneless
syllable and the unassociated floating low tone. The Majang language
instead opts for leaving the floating low tone unassociated, while dealing
with the toneless syllable through tone copying from the stem. Other mor-
phemes, such as the 3P.CJ marker -ɛr on ɗɛjɛr ‘they want’, have a fixed low
tone, which is always realized on the syllable itself. There is no apparent
alternative to an analysis which assumes that there is an underlying differ-
ence between an associated low tone on some morphemes (such as on -ɛr
‘3P.CP’) and a non-associated, floating low tone on other morphemes, such as
the noun-plural marker -ɛL. The underlying representation of these two mor-
phemes must be different, as they behave differently in word formation.
At least some phonologists claim that each floating tone must connect to an
available toneless TBU. The Tone Mapping Rule in Halle and Vergnaud
(1982, p. 67), which they adopted from Williams (1976), would clearly rule
out Majang’s behavior. One way to uphold the Tone Mapping Rule is an as-
sumption that the floating L is created in the process of the tone-spreading.
Such a conclusion might be drawn as a result of the fact that almost all tone-
less morphemes behave like the 3P.DJ marker -irL or the plural marker -ɛL –
they have an inherent floating L. This could invite an analysis involving a
rule that somehow adds this floating low tone to a toneless morpheme when-
ever the resulting surface tone on the suffix is high. Unfortunately, this pro-
posed rule is rendered untenable by the presence of a few toneless mor-
phemes without a floating L when a H spreads on the toneless syllable. Some
non-modified plural nominative suffixes, for example, clearly copy the stem
tone without using a floating low tone, as in càkomà < càkom-à ‘friends
(NOM)’ or wàrtùn < wàr-tùn ‘dogs (NOM)’. There is therefore no rule in Majang
that places a floating L following high-tone copying. All other attempts to
maintain the constraint would require assumptions about tone replacement
on what is here called a toneless morpheme, and such an analysis would
make very complicated what can easily be described in terms of tone spread-
ing. Other languages display similar violations, such as the Bantu languages
Kikuria and Chiyao (Odden, 1995, p. 459), although the floating tone in-
volved in those languages is a high tone. In the following, all morphemes
with a similar behavior as the 3P.DJ markers -ɛrL and -irL, or the plural marker
  L
-ɛ , are represented in the examples as being toneless with an unassociated
floating low tone. Other analyses of their behavior may be possible, but I
leave these to be worked out by those who have a higher interest in main-
96                                    Chapter II.6taining the validity of the above universal that such morphemes should not
exist in any language.
One particular morpheme of the Majang language, the 1P.DJ suffix on the
verb, also shows variation, but in a different manner than toneless suffixes.
Example II.35: polar tone on the 1P.DJ suffix
     a) toníːL        b)   gùːgùɲíː
        {ton-í ,ːL}        {gùːgùɲ-í ,ːL}
        tell-1P.DJ          enter-1P.DJ
        we tell             we enterThe 1P.DJ suffix consistently has a high tone following a low-toned stem (ex-
ample a), and a low tone following a high-toned stem (example b). If it re-
ceives a high tone, it again causes downstep on a following high-toned word.
It is therefore assumed that the suffix in its underlying representation is
equipped with both a polar tone and a floating low tone, and is therefore re-
presented in the lexicon as -í ,ːL, where the superscript cross symbol represents
the polar tone.
For the two Gur languages Moore and Lama the authors Kenstowicz, Niki-
ema and Ourso (1988) demonstrated that polar tone goes back to an underly-
ing high tone that is dissimilated when following another high tone as an in-
stance of Meeussen’s Rule (HH → HL), which applies to avoid violations of
the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP). If this were the case in Majang,
then the underlying representation of the 1P.DJ suffix would be -íːL. It would
keep its shape when following a low-toned stem, and when following a high
tone, OCP would force it to be realized as -íː. Such an analysis would have
the advantage of providing the suffix with a more regular position in the pa-
radigm, where most other person markers also have a high tone, such as
1S.DJ -à or 2S.DJ -ín. The conjoint forms of these, including the 1st person
plural, have a fixed low tone: -à, -ín and -íː.
In spite of these benefits, such an analysis is not tenable for Majang. There
are countless morphemes in Majang with a lexical high tone that do not un-
dergo Meeussen’s Rule to avoid a violation of OCP. These include the other
members of the disjoint person paradigm listed above. When these follow a
high-toned stem, they are subject to morpheme downstep, which is the lan-
guage’s device of choice to deal with OCP violations. It could be argued that
the long vowel of the 1P suffix may trigger a different strategy, but there are
other long-voweled morphemes such as the disjoint impersonal marker -ɛːL
                                                     Tone                                                       97(as in ɓɔ̀lɔ̀ːꜜrɛːL ‘one grows’) that refute this idea. It undergoes morpheme
downstep like all other high-toned suffixes. Consequently, the only way to
describe the 1P.DJ morpheme is to assume an underlying representation that
includes its polar-tone behavior24. Majang can therefore be listed among the
languages that support Newman’s (1995, p. 775) and Cahill’s (2004) idea
that at least for some languages one can assume genuine tonal polarity.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"

II.6.4 The functional load of tone in Majang
Lexical minimal pairs with regard to tone are not difficult to find in Majang:
Example II.36: tone minimal pairs
     a)   coːꜜmoj       HꜜH      [ ] tree, sp.             vs.    coːmoj       LH     [ ]    quiver
     b)   tàŋL         H        [] cow                     vs.    tàŋ         L      []25   abscess
     c)   ŋedàn        H        [ ] bee                   vs.    ŋedàn       L      [ ]   tooth
     d)   kǎːrŋ26       LH       [/] he fights               vs.    kàːrŋ       H      []      they goOn top of the heavy lexical functional load of tone, Bender (1983, p. 117)
states that “the principal function of tone seems to be grammatical” in Ma-
jang, without going into any details. It is indeed true that some morpho-
logical processes are characterized by tonal changes to the stem of a noun or
verb (see section IV.1.3 for more details). More importantly, tone expresses
some important syntactic functions – sometimes even as the only means:
Example II.37: ergative and absolutive distinguished by tone
     a) èːŋáɗír     kùtùr                        b) èːŋáɗír     kùtùr
        {èːŋáɗ-ír   kùtùr}                          {èːŋáɗ-ír   kùtùr}
        smell-CF.3S hog\SG.ERG                         smell-CF.3S hog\SG.ABS
        a hog smells (tr.)                             he smells a hog
24
   See Cahill (2004) for an analysis of polar tone in the Gur language K ɔnni which also is notnni which also is not
   OCP-driven. As he works in the Optimality Theory framework, he creates a morphological-
   ly restricted constraint POLAR to anchor the process outside of the realm of pure phonology.
25
   Pre-pausal low tone usually is phonetically realized as a tone falling from low.
26
   Because contour tones are much less frequent than level tones, minimal pairs involving
   contour tones are hard to find. Example d) therefore compares two different lexical roots in
   two different morphological contexts.
98                                  Chapter II.6In examples a) and b), the only difference between hog in the absolutive and
in the ergative case is the tone, which is L-HL for the ergative and L-H for
the absolutive.
Another syntactic function expressed by tone is the conjoint-disjoint marking
on the verb. The conjoint form is used for non-topical absolutive NPs:
Example II.38: conjoint and disjoint marking:
     à) ŋùːlè béàL.                  b) ŋùːlé tɔ̀n béàL.
         {ŋùːl-ɛ      béàL}              {ŋùːl-ɛ        tɔ̀n      béàL}
         break-3S.CJ spear\SG.ABS         break-3S.DJ boy\SG.NOM spear\SG.ABS
         He broke the spear.              The boy broke the spear.","[103, 104]"

I.10.3 Presentation of data
The Majang language shows no grammatical difference between masculine
and feminine. For simplicity, I have chosen to use masculine pronouns for
the English glosses in all elicited examples involving the third person singu-
lar, except in cases where the semantic context makes a masculine referent
rather unlikely. If the lexeme suggests a non-human referent, the neuter pro-
noun ‘it’ was chosen.
If the example is taken from a text, then the choice of pronouns in the
English glosses follows the pragmatic context of the example. In the follow-
ing sentence, the use of the impersonal form without object pronoun leaves
the identity of the object ambiguous.
Example I.1: presentation of pragmatic context in textual examples
     máL tɛːnàn ɟéːmɛL kɛːL rɔ̀ːríjáːtìŋ.

IV.2.1.3 Infinite verbs
There are two different infinite verb forms in Majang: infinitive and nega-
tive. For the majority of verbs these forms can be accomplished by adding a
productive suffix to the stem. These suffixes are presented in section
IV.2.2.1 Infinite verb forms below. Both forms are syntactically verbal
nouns, but at least the infinitive can still serve as the semantic predicate of a
subject or object clause (see examples IV.100 and V.121). The negative
form is quite restricted in its use, but the infinitive form has all the morpho-
logical characteristics of a noun, which means that it can be inflected for
number and case. Many nouns of the lexicon are in fact lexicalized infinitive
forms. Other nouns are derived from verbs by the use of some less produc-
tive nominalization devices provided by the Majang morphology; these often
result in lexicalized meanings, not as predictable as the ones gleaned from
the infinitive or negative verb forms.
212                             Chapter IV.2IV.2.2 Derivation processes for verbal roots
This section explores the derivation processes that operate on verbal roots. It
is not always easy in Majang to decide which verbal markings are to be seen
as derivational and which as inflectional. Nominalization is certainly a deri-
vational device, and the main-clause person marking is clearly inflection.
Other categories may be less clear, such as the impersonal marking or the
various direction forms found in Majang. For the former there are some
indications that place it firmly in the inflectional drawer; for the direction
markings things are less straightforward.
The following processes are described in this section as derivational, as they
produce new stems from verbal roots: nominalizations (with infinitives and
negative verbs), detransitivization, inceptive verbs, durative verbs, and two
more derivation devices with an unclear semantic interpretation. Further-
more, the formation of imperfective verb stems through reduplication makes
it profitable to treat this device in this section.","[217, 218]"
"Ordinal numerals are formed from the cardinal numerals by adding the
formative -eːnL to the numeral stem.
Example IV.251: ordinal numerals
  1st omoŋeːnL          6th tùlà omeːnL
  2nd pɛːjeːnL          7th tùlà pɛːjeːnL
  3rd ɟíːteːnL         8th tùlà ɟíːteːnL
  4th àŋàneːnL        9th tùlà àŋàneːnL
  5th tùːleːnL         10th àrneːnL
These ordinal numerals are syntactically nouns, and they can be inflected for
number and case. The formative -eːn may be related to the nominalizer -ikeːn
seen in example IV.2.

IV.3.4 Adverbs
The Majang language uses two kinds of adverbs – the one being an open
class of regular adverbs which is used to provide any kind of adverbial infor-
mation on the clause-level, and the other a small closed class of particles
which provide information on tense.
                                Other Word Classes                                 305IV.3.4.1 Adverbs on the clause level
Clause level adverbs can be created in several different ways. First there are
a number of short adverbs providing information about the temporal or local
pragmatic setting. Many of them go back to some kind of demonstrative
form.
Temporal adverbs are: nɛːkɛ ‘now (POSS.3S.SG.LOC)’, cìcéL/cìcɛL/cìcɔ̀L ‘now’,
     L
càːdí ‘then’, kɛː ‘then’, kɛɓúː ‘sometimes’, òtóːp ‘often’, báꜜŋí ‘afterwards’,
   L                     L                                                      L
cáː ‘thereafter’, ɟéːmɛ ‘previously’, ɓéɲcè ‘today’ (from ɓɛːɲɔ̀ ‘day’ and ce
                                        L
‘DEM.SP.LOC’), kɔ̀ álɛ ‘yesterday’, kɔ̀ː álɛ ‘tomorrow’, kɔ̀ ájtínán ‘day before
yesterday’, kɔ̀ːL ájtínán ‘day after tomorrow’, rómíːɗ ‘in the morning’, írkíɗ
‘at dawn’, káːlt ‘at midnight’, tɛːn ‘in the beginning’.
Local adverbs are: cèːd/cèːdíL ‘here’, cɛːd/cɛːdíL ‘there (HR)’, còːd/còːdíL ‘there
(DIST)’, cáːL ‘there’, ìcíL ‘right here’, ɔ̀cɔ̀L ‘right there’, cǒːj ‘far away’, ɔ̀ːnkùŋ
‘near’, ɟók ‘nearby’, ɗíɗíká ‘right’, kántáL ‘left’ (dative of kántL ‘left hand’),
      L
ɗɛːgá ‘across, down’, ɛdɛn ‘up, east’, pàːnì ‘down, west’, ràŋànà ‘upwards’,
wàlàc ‘outwards’, wàlɛc ‘from outside’, cɛm ‘straight’.
Further short adverbs are used for providing modal information about the
action: ɟɛt ‘very’, cɔ̀kà, kàɗɛːŋ ‘perhaps’, dákɛːɗà ‘only’, dɔ̀ːc ‘well’, éːkéːrɛ
‘truly’ (locative of eːkeːr ‘truth’), kócɛk, kójùnk ‘like this’, kócùnk ‘like that’,
                                                 L
ìcígìcìgǐ ‘exactly like that’, kɛkàr ‘again’, ín ‘yet’, kɛlɔ̀t ‘carefully’, kɛɗɔ̀m
‘properly’, tɔ̀cɛ ‘correct’, líkì ‘correct’ (loanword from Amharic), mó
‘alone’.
Some adverbs are formed from two words, such as àgútL òmóŋL ‘together’ or
                                L
táːmɛtàkán ‘directly’ from táːmá ‘face’ and tàk ‘inside’.
At least one adverb needs to combine with another particle to form a com-
plete unit, the adverb ɓɔ̀ ‘also’. It needs to be followed by a pragmatic pro-
noun (see example IV.221). It comes in the following combinations:
Example IV.253: adverb ɓɔ̀ with pragmatic particles
   1S ɓɔ̀ rà      1P ɓɔ̀ re
   2S ɓɔ̀ re       2P ɓɔ̀ rɔ̀
   3S ɓɔ̀ rɛ       3P ɓɔ̀ rɛ
Other ways to form adverbs were presented elsewhere. Stative verbs can turn
to adverbs by use of their locative infinitive form, as seen in example
IV.202. Other stative verbs are adverbialized by using the clause-internal
306                             Chapter IV.3conjunction à (see example IV.201). But this device does not only work for
stative verbs, but for other verbs, too.

  learn-3P.DJ child-PL.NOM.MOD POSS.3S.PL-NOM CONJ NEG-3P suffer-NEG
  His children learn without problems.","[310, 311, 312]"
"There is also a negative existential form, which, just as the affirmative form
     L
làkɛ , is an impersonal verb form:
Example V.90: use of negative existential form
   ìɟáːg kɛːL cìnɔ̀ tɛmk ɛ kɛːL cìnɔ̀ dàràːjɛːk.

      REL-SG-DIST despise-IMPS=SUB
      There is no work that is small or despised.","[385, 386]"
"
II.6.2 Downstep
Majang uses downstep, both automatic and non-automatic. Whenever a H
follows a surface L, its register is lowered, so that the H is pronounced on a
lower pitch than any preceding H in the same clause. At clause boundaries,
the register is reset. This is called automatic downstep.
There are also many instances, however, when a high tone following a high
tone has its register lowered. There appear to be two different causes for this:
1. Some morphemes are accompanied by a floating low tone, which is not
   audible on the word itself, but which lowers the register of the following
   word. This non-automatic downstep usually22 operates across word
   boundaries.
       Example II.26: non-automatic downstep caused by floating low tones
         a) béàL nàːk     my spear         [   ]                 HL H
          b)     bolbol nàːk    my calf of leg     []                 H       H
22
     Example IV.24 presents an analysis where the floating L is assumed to manifest itself on an
     attached suffix.
                                     Tone                                      89    In both examples, a noun with a final H is followed by the 1S.SG.ABS pos-
    sessive pronoun, which also has an inherent H. In example a), this high
    tone on the pronoun is downstepped, whereas in example b), it is on the
    same register as the preceding high tone. In order to account for this dif-
    ference, it is necessary to assume that the noun in example a) is accom-
    panied by some device that lowers the register for the rest of the clause.
    The noun in example b), however, is not accompanied by such a regis-
    ter-lowering device. For the purposes of this section, it is not important
    to decide whether this device lowering the register is part of the preced-
    ing noun stem or an affix that is only attached to the nouns of a particu-
    lar inflection class (see the section on singular marking on p. 150 for
    more information). In either case, the proposed analysis assumes that the
    noun in example a) is accompanied by a floating L that causes the lower-
    ing of the register on the following possessive pronoun. This floating L
    is absent in example b), and no phonological reason beyond posing such
    a floating L can be identified that determines which noun causes a
    downstep and which doesn’t. In this study, I call this kind of non-auto-
    matic downstep word downstep, as it crosses word boundaries. In the
    2879-word text sample, this kind of downstep occurs 882 times. As this
    floating low tone is a part of the lexical material of the utterance, it is in
    this study always written (with the superscript L), even if it does not have
    a phonetic effect preceding words beginning with a low tone.
2. When two separate underlying high tones come together within a word
   across morpheme boundaries, the first syllable of the second morpheme
   is affected by a lowering of the register. This happens in order to avoid
   an obvious violation of the Obligatory Contour Principle. Cahill (2004,
   p. 5) lists a number of other African languages (Kishambaa, Supyire and
   Namwanga) which share this behavior. The situation in Namwanga par-
   ticularly mirrors the evidence in Majang (Bickmore, 2000, p. 302f). This
   non-automatic downstep only operates between morphemes within a
   word. Two high tones meeting across word boundaries do not trigger
   downstep if no floating L is involved (see example II.26b). The analysis
   proposed here does not assume the presence of a floating L between the
   two underlying high tones triggering the morpheme downstep. Such a
   floating L is present neither underlyingly, nor as a product of a phono-
   logical rule creating the downstep. The downstep is a lowering of the
   register, and is not caused by the insertion of an unrealized low tone.
   This agrees in principle with Odden’s (1986, p. 366) interpretation of the
90                               Chapter II.6      facts in Kishambaa. This form of non-automatic downstep is therefore
      fundamentally different from the word downstep introduced above, and
      is accordingly indicated by a different orthographic symbol (ꜜ).
      Example II.27: non-automatic downstep within a word
         coːꜜmoj tree, sp.         []          H   H
      This noun consists of the root morpheme plus the non-productive nomi-
      nalizer -oj (see example IV.125). I call this kind of non-automatic down-
      step morpheme downstep, as it crosses morpheme boundaries only, but
      never word boundaries. This kind of downstep is much less frequent
      than the word downstep, with only 87 occurrences in the 2879-word text
      sample.
Both types of non-automatic downstep may involve the same word, as the
following noun phrase illustrates:
Example II.28: combination of downsteps
     wákàꜜcàkɛL      gàːnɛ      [   ]
     {wákàc-àk-ɛ L
                       gàːn-ɛ }
                              L
     crossroads-PL-LOC POSS\1S.PL-LOC
     at my crossroadsThis example has two downsteps operating on the noun wákàꜜcàkɛL. The first
downstep following the stem wàkàc is caused by the addition of the plural
suffix -àk, which has its own underlying high tone. The high tone on wàkàc
spreads out over both syllables of the stem and therefore stays on the same
register. The presence of the new H on -àk is announced by the morpheme
downstep between the two morphemes. The H on -àk spreads out to the next
morpheme, the toneless locative marker -ɛL. As no new tone is involved, the
register stays the same on the two syllables -àkɛL. Although the locative
marker -ɛL is toneless as such, and therefore available for the copying of the
H on -àk, it is accompanied by a floating low tone. This floating L then
causes the H on gàːnɛL to be downstepped, according to the principle of word
downstep.
Although minimal pairs entirely based on non-automatic downstep are rare,
they do exist. Quite frequently the contrast is used for the paradigmatic dis-
tinction between absolutive nouns (ABS) and nominative nouns (NOM).

     I see a dog again.

     bite-AP.3S dog\SG.NOM          again
     The dog bites again.
In both examples, the noun wàr ‘dog’ is followed by the same adverb kɛkàr,
which begins with a H and therefore serves well as an indicator for downstep
caused by preceding words. Downstep of kɛkàr happens in example a), but
not in example b), which illustrates that the forms for absolutive and nomi-
native can be subtly different for some nouns (other nouns do not display
that difference through downstep, if at all – see section IV.1.3.1 for details
on how the various noun forms are distinguished morphologically).
The two different kinds of non-automatic downstep in Majang provide an
excellent tool for determining word boundaries in Majang. This is illustrated
by the following examples, where the absence of a downstep between the
words of example d) proves to be crucial:
Example II.30: downstep and word boundaries

These examples show that the recent past marker kɔ̀ always carries a high
tone, regardless of the preceding tones, which implies that the high tone is
92                                    Chapter II.6part of the underlying representation of this marker. It is also shown that the
H on kɔ̀ is not downstepped following a high-toned morpheme (example d).
This proves that the morpheme downstep does not apply to the marker kɔ̀,
which in turn proves that kɔ̀ is neither a suffix nor a clitic, as it was analyzed
by Bender (1983, p. 134) or Unseth (1989b, p. 108), but an independent
word (the same can be assumed, by extension, for all other tense markers of
the language).
Unfortunately, the neat picture presented so far is disturbed by a number of
verbal paradigms where the application of the morpheme-downstep rule does
not suffice to explain the tonal variation between stems lexically ending on a
high tone and those ending on a low tone. The following examples are taken
from the relative-past paradigms presented in example IV.165.
Example II.31: unexplained tonal behavior in some complex verbal paradigms
     a)        {ped} ‘finish’ L-melody
          1S   pèdíːɗàL     {ped-íːɗ-àL} after I had finished     b)        {ìbáːl} ‘play’ LH-melody
          1S   ìbáːlíːɗàL   {ìbáːl-íːɗ-àL} after I had played
Both examples take i-class stems ending on a consonant and add the relative-
past marker -íːɗ, followed by the toneless 1S person marker -àL. Example a)
gives the impression that the relative-past marker has an underlying high
tone, which is realized without modification following the low-toned stem
pèd ‘finish’. But following a stem ending on a high tone, as in example b)
following ìbáːl ‘play’, the suffix high tone is not downstepped, as one would
expect after the application of the morpheme-downstep rule. These examples
suggest the presence of a phonological word boundary between the stem and
the relative-past marker, but such a boundary has no place in these examples,
because the syllabification treats the relative-past verbs as single words – it
is not reasonable to assume a phonological word boundary inside the syl-
lables /díː/ (a) and /líː/ (b). One could also assume a tone merger of the two
high tones as a strategy to avoid a violation of the Obligatory Contour Prin-
ciple (OCP), but the language does not make use of this strategy elsewhere.
Another unsatisfactory way to describe what is happening is to assume two
tonal allomorphs of the relative-past marker: one allomorph has an under-
lying high tone in the environment of a stem-final low tone. The other allo-
morph is toneless in the environment of a stem-final high tone, and it
                                            Tone                                            93therefore copies the stem tone without triggering the morpheme-downstep.
This allomorphy rule is suffering from a lack of phonological motivation.
A better way to look at this assumes that morphemes with this behavior fol-
low a tone-replacement rule that replaces all stem tones with the high tone of
the morpheme until it is blocked by a stem L. The morpheme -íːɗ (from now
on marked with the super-high tone marker to indicate its tone-replacement
behavior) replaces the stem tones by its own high tone. In example II.31a),
this is blocked by the low tone on the stem, and in example b), it succeeds
for the second stem syllable, which has an underlying H, but not for the first
syllable of the stem, which has a blocking L. The absence of word-internal
downstep in this word makes any analysis that maintains the association of
the original stem H untenable.
This behavior is restricted to the more complex verb paradigms involving
subordinate-tense forms or direction markers (section IV.2.3). These will be
marked by the super-high tone marker, just as some other morphemes
(particularly infinitive and noun-plural markers) whose tone-replacement be-
havior is not blocked by low tones on the stem.","[94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"
"Inceptive derivation
Some stative verbs were found to take on the inceptive marker -Vr (see
example IV.132 for its full description), which effectively turns the stative
verb into an intransitive verb denoting a process and not a state. Thus
ɓànkáw ‘strong’ turns into ɓánkáːwúr ‘become strong’, kɔ̀ɟ ‘black’ into kɔ̀ɟúr
‘fade’, jòwɛːɗ ‘far’ into jòwɛːɗir ‘avoid’ and eɲàː into èɲɛr ‘fill’. The last two
examples even function as transitive verbs.
280                                   Chapter IV.2IV.2.4.3 Inflectional processes
Stative verbs are inflected almost exactly like other verbs, in the sense that
they take six different person suffixes, which vary according to the inflection
class of the stative verb. But these classes are not the same as the ones estab-
lished for other verbs in section IV.2.3. Some of those verbal inflection clas-
ses seem to be avoided by stative verbs. No stative verbs at all are found in
the i-class. On the other hand, almost all of the u-class lexemes are stative
verbs, except for làk ‘have’, which is treated syntactically like a transitive
verb. Because of their inherent semantics, stative verbs are restricted in what
verb morphology they can take: they cannot be used with an impersonal
marker, and directional morphology (centrifugal, centripetal and deictic
transfer) were encountered very sparsely.
Majang stative verbs cannot undergo any comparative inflection. All at-
tempts to elicit comparative or superlative forms revealed nothing of that sort.
a-class stative verbs
Most stative verbs belong to the a-class with k-extension (see example
IV.158 for their regular-verb counterparts). About 30 such stative verbs were
counted. All of these come either with a high stem tone, or with a LH
melody.
Example IV.203: a-class stative verbs with k-extension
      ɓáːj H         bitter          kòpúl LH     white            díldíl LH     fat

   3S ɓà*ːj         ɓà*ːj          kòpúl        kòpúl            díldíl        díldíl

   3P ɓáːjɛr         ɓáːj-ɛr         kòpúlɟà     kòpúl-ɟà        díldílꜜkàr   díldíl-k-àr
As can be seen, not all of these stative verbs behave like regular a-class
verbs with k-extension. ɓàːj ‘bitter’ and càlow ‘cold’ form their 3P form ac-
cording to the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class of verbs. Three more, áːj ‘slack’, páːk ‘hot’, and gól
‘selfish’ even have the 3S form according to the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class. Other stative verbs,
like kòpúl ‘white’, cɔ̀líɗ ‘green’ or àːɗíː ‘ripe’ have stem changes in their 3P
forms: kòpúlɟà, cɔ̀lùrɟà and àːɗíːtà. These stem changes are similar to the ones
seen in the u-class of stative verbs below. A special case is mentàn ‘good’,
which has a very irregular 3P form mentàːnà (DJ) and mentàːnà (CJ).

A group of 17 stative verbs were found with person markers very similar to
the a-class (including the stem extension -k for the 1st and 2nd person forms),
but it uses a 3P marker including the vowel /ù/ plus a consonant from the
set /t, ɟ or ɗ/. All of these stative verbs have a H or LH tone pattern, just as
the a-class stative verbs.
The following paradigms show the general pattern, but more information
needs to be given on other individual stative verbs:
Example IV.204: u-class stative verbs
      ɓáláː H      little           ŋàː H         smelly          tokol LH     narrow
   1S báláːꜜkà    ɓáláː-k-à       ŋàːꜜkà       ŋàː-k-à       tokolꜜkà    tokol-k-à

   3S ɓáláː        ɓáláː            ŋàː           ŋàː            tokol        tokol
   1P ɓáláːkíː    ɓáláː-k-í ,ːL   ŋàːkíː       ŋàː-k-í ,ːL   tokolkíː    tokol-k-í ,ːL
   2P ɓáláːkà*r   ɓáláː-k-à*r     ŋàːkà*r      ŋàː-k-à*r     tokolkà*r   tokol-k-à*r
   3P ɓáláːtù      ɓáláː-tù         ŋàːɗù        ŋàː-ɗù        tokolɟù     tokol-ɟù
Ten stative verbs use the 3P-marker -tù: ɓáláː ‘little’, ɗínàːn ‘unripe’, ɗɔ̀m
‘sharp’, koɟ ‘black’, ɟeːdoː ‘long’, rɔ̀màː ‘equal’, pɔ̀jɔ̀ː ‘light’, obíː ‘big’, pàːl
‘dry’, and díŋ ‘short’. They have in common that they usually either end in a
long vowel, or a nasal /m, n, ŋ/. But this picture is disturbed by the presence
of pàːl and koɟ in this group. All these stative verbs, except pɔ̀jɔ̀ː, have a H
melody. Two of these add the marker -tù also preceding the 2P suffix, result-
ing in the forms pàːltùkà*r and díŋàtùkà*r.
Six stative verbs use the 3P-marker -ɟù: ɓùkùr ‘deep’, tùpeːɲ ‘white’, tɛŋɛːl
‘thin’, tokol ‘narrow’, jowɛːɗ ‘narrow’ and bàkàɲ ‘wide’. They all have a LH
melody, and their stems end in a consonant from the set / l, r, ɗ, ɲ/, which
overlaps with the tù-type stative verbs only for pàːl ‘dry’. These six stative
verbs all behave regularly as tokol shown in example IV.204 above, except
for tùpeːɲ, which has a H on the 3P suffix tùpéːɲɟù ‘they are white’.
The stative verb ŋàː ‘smelly’ is the only one of its kind – no other stative verb
was found using the 3P-marker -ɗù. Its irregular nature is reinforced by the
tone change between 1st and 2nd person on one side and the 3rd person with a
low tone on the other.
Another verb of the u-class is the possessive verb làk ‘have’. Although it
seems to have a higher valence than stative verbs (it requires the possessor as
the subject and the possessed as the second constituent) it has the person
282                                        Chapter IV.2marking pattern of u-class stative verbs – the only bivalent verb in Majang to
do so. It does not have an attested negative or an infinitive form (one would
expect the form *làkkàː), but otherwise it takes on the person markers of sta-
tive verbs:
Example IV.205: the auxiliary làk ‘have’
   1S làkà        làk-à        I have
   2S làkín        làk-ín        you have
                                      SG

   3P làtù        là-tù        they have
In its impersonal form làkɛL, this verb is used as an existential copula, as in
example IV.274a).","[285, 286, 287, 288]"
