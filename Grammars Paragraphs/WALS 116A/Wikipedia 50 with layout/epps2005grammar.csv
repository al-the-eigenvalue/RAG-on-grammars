"17.4.3. Polar questions with focus on constituentThis interrogative strategy is typically used in questions involving a focused constituent,and is also very common for rhetorical purposes, such as when responding to a speaker(i.e. a ‘backchanneling’ strategy akin to ‘really?’, ‘is that right?’, ‘uh-huh’, etc. inEnglish). Its formal organization is essentially like that of the constituent or ‘question-word’ question, but without the initial question word; however, like the predicate-focusedpolar questions discussed above, it solicits a yes-no answer. Its constituent order is thesame as that of the typical declarative clause, from which it is formally distinguished bythe presence of the Interrogative Boundary Suffix -V/ (or the unreduced form of theFuture suffix -tég) on the clause-final verb, in place of the Declarative marker -Vêh.",[966]
"       Intonation in polar questions tends to be relatively high throughout the clause(compared to declarative and other Hup clause types); it is fairly level, but falls slightly atthe end of the clause (as does intonation on constituent questions). The fact that Huppolar questions in general have a relatively higher intonation than declarative clauses is atypologically common pattern; even the placement of the higher intonation at thebeginning of the clause rather than at the end is typologically not unusual (cf. Siemund2001: 1013).
                                                                                         946
       Examples of predicate-focused polar questions are given in (123) (posed on themorning after a drinking party), and (124), which was uttered by a grandmother,exasperated by the younger men’s liquor-drinking.

       ‘Did you all get drunk?’ (OS)(124) wQ‡d=yˆ¤/ nˆ¤h-ˆ¤y            nˆ¤N-a‡n      tˆ¤h ?!
       food=TEL      be.like-DYNM 2pl-OBJ 3sg
       ‘Is it just like food for you all?!’ (B.Cv.90)Because predicate-focused polar interrogatives require a pronominal subject, the subjectreferent can only be referred to by non-pronominal means externally to the interrogativeclause (i.e. in cases where it is not already clear from the discourse):
(125) mangá         tá/-ay,          hˆ¤d-a‡n      yamhidç/-nˆ¤h    tˆ¤h ?
       Margarita    REL.INST-INCH 3pl-OBJ sing-NEG                  3sg
       ‘What about Margarita, did she sing to them?’ (TD04.Cv)       The interrogative discourse-marker =b’ay (see §17.4.1 above) is very common inpolar questions, where it follows the clause-final subject:
(126) hi-wag-yˆ/-pó-y                    hˆ¤d=b’ay,         /ána?
       FACT-day-TEL-EMPH1-DYNM 3pl=AGAIN                    Ana
       ‘Did they stay up all night, Ana?’ (TD.Cv.97)(127) nutQ‡n bˆ/-ní-íy             nˆ¤N=b’ay?
       today       make-be-DYNM 2pl=AGAIN
       ‘Did you all work today?’ (B.Cv.90)       Negatively biased polar questions are phrased as negative predicates within theinterrogative clause (example 128). A negative polar interrogative can also be used as apolite invitation (example 129).
                                                                                        947(128) ham-nˆ¤h-ay      /ám?

       ‘Are you not going?’ (OS)(129) wQd-nˆ¤h-ay      /ám?
       eat-NEG-INCH 2sg
       ‘Won’t you eat something?’ (OS)       Emphasis in polar questions can be signaled via the clause-final Focus marker-áh, as well as the predicative Emphasis form -pog:
(130) ham-pog-tég       nˆ¤N-áh?!
       go-EMPH1-FUT 2pl-FOC
       ‘Will/would you really go?!’ (B.Cv.81)       Polar interrogatives involving predicate nominals are typically identity questions,and are most commonly formed with the ‘intangible’ demonstrative yúp (often yúp=b’ayin Barriera; yú in Tat Deh):
(131) mçhç‡y=yˆ/     yúp?
       deer=TEL      that.ITG
       ‘Is that a deer?’ (EL)       Perhaps the most frequent use of polar questions is the standard Hup greeting,which involves asking a question about whatever the addressee is obviously engaged in atthe time. These questions are clearly not really requests for information—the formulavirtually requires the answer to be obvious—but are a conventionalized speech act for thepurpose of social interaction. The standard answer is an affirmative repetition of the verbphrase (see §17.4.5 below). One of the most conventionalized of these questions is thestandard morning greeting (example 132). Other common greetings are provided in(136-38); (133) is often said when entering a house where a number of people are
                                                                                        948
gathered, and (135) is conventionally used to greet a visitor from another communityon his/her arrival in one’s own village. As expected, addressing more than one personrequires the second person plural pronoun nˆ¤N in place of singular /ám, as in (133).(132) c´w´¤/-´¤y          /ám?
       awake-DYNM 2sg
       ‘Are you awake?’ (OS)(133) ní-íy        nˆ¤N?

       ‘Are you lying in a hammock?’ (OS)(135) nQ¤n-Q¤y           /ám?
       come-DYNM 2sg
       ‘Have you arrived?’ (OS)Likewise, situation-specific questions regarding the addressee’s current (observable)activity are perfectly acceptable greetings:
(136) te‡g    t´¤/-´¤y            /ám?
       wood light.fire-DYNM 2sg
       ‘Are you lighting a fire?’ (OS)(137) hQ¤w-Q¤y           /ám?
       scrape-DYNM 2sg
       ‘Are you scraping (manioc)?’ (OS)       The word order inversion strategy used in these predicate-focused polar questionsis undoubtedly the most typologically striking feature of Hup. Such use of word orderinversion in polar questions is common in European languages, but it is relativelyuncommon elsewhere in the world. Moreover, the fact that it is the only interrogativesubtype in Hup to use a word order inversion strategy violates—at least marginally—
                                                                                                            949
Greenberg’s (1966) universal 11, which states that inversion with polar interrogativesonly occurs in those languages which use inversion to mark constituent interrogatives.193However, inversion in polar questions is restricted in Hup; it involves only pronominalsubjects, and does not occur in constituent-focused polar questions (see §17.4.3 below).","[962, 963, 964, 965, 966]"
"         While soliciting a yes-no answer, these questions front a non-predicativeconstituent of the clause, which is understood (via this fronting strategy) to be the focusof the question.194 In many cases, this results in a semi-rhetorical question—i.e. a
193
    Note that word order inversion is attested in Hup constituent questions, but only those involving the
exceptional interrogative verb forms ‘say’ and ‘be like’ (§17.4.1).
194
    Note that the strategy of fronting a focused constituent of the clause is common to Hup clauses
generally, not just interrogatives (see §17.3.1).
                                                                                                          950
question to which one already knows the answer and is simply soliciting agreement orconfirmation, rather than more substantial information. Thus in Hup this type ofinterrogative, which is the least formally marked subtype, also corresponds to the leastinformation-oriented interrogative—a cross-linguistically common pattern (Sadock andZwicky 1985: 180).195         Examples of this interrogative strategy are given in (138-40); in all cases, thequestion is focused on the clause-initial constituent.

         ‘You’re going to the roça?’ (OS)         In this type of interrogative, it is common for the -V/ Interrogative suffix to occurtwice in the clause: both clause-finally on the verb, as expected, and also directly on thefronted, queried nominal entity, giving it special interrogative focus. In this case, itattaches to the final element of the queried noun phrase (as is consistent with nominalmorphological patterns generally), and receives stress—unlike the clause-finaloccurrence of -V/ on the verb, which is unstressed. This focus function of -V/ isillustrated in examples (141-44).","[966, 967]"

               ‘To Bernadito’s daughter.’ (TD.Cv.105)       The affirmative particle h´‡/ ‘yes, all right’ is also common in response to polarquestions, and can be used either by itself or preceding an affirmative clause. Forexample, the response in (161) comes from the story of the Tapir and the Turtle; the

       yes    there 3sg sleep
       ‘Yes, he slept there.’ (JA.73)       There is no general word for ‘no’ in Hup; however, the negative predicativeparticle pãÙ (see §16.2) can be used in response to questions dealing with the presence orexistence of nominal entities:

The primarymorphological characteristics marking the simple imperative are several. These includethe lack of any Boundary Suffix on the verb (such that this clause type can be consideredthe unmarked member of the set in Table 17.1 above, contrasting with Dynamic,interrogative, declarative, and subordinate clauses), and obligatory high (falling) tone.","[971, 972, 973]"

17.4.4. Interrogative Alternative marker =ha/The enclitic =ha/ signals an alternative question, in which the speaker presents a choicebetween two (or more) opposing options. The marker =ha/ can appear utterance-finallyor multiple times within the clause, or both simultaneously, and can attach both tofocused constituents and to the predicate, as examples (150-52) illustrate. Thedisjunction /ó ‘or’ (probably from Portuguese ou ‘or’, borrowed via Tukano) is commonin these clauses, though not in general obligatory (see §18.1.5).

This construction is used as a kindof interjection or interactive tag, particularly for expressing a shade of doubt regarding anaffirmation (example 154), and can also be used to mark a self-correction (example 155).

Responding to interrogativesContent questions are typically answered with a standard declarative clause, or moreminimally, a single word that provides the particular information solicited. In the case ofyes-no questions, the typical response is the repetition of the verb phrase that appeared inthe interrogative (whether negative or affirmative), in declarative form. Subjects arefrequently dropped. Examples (156-60) illustrate question-answer dyads between twospeakers (A and B).","[969, 970, 971]"

However, theFuture suffix pair -teg / -te- is exceptional: whereas clause-final verbs in declarativeclauses generally take the reduced form -te- followed directly by Declarative -h, only theunreduced form -teg can appear in an interrogative clause, as illustrated in (101-4). It ispossible (although rare) for the Future suffix -tég to receive an additional -V/ suffix, butthe reduced counterpart -te-/ cannot occur (example 103). This is not true ofphonologically reduced suffixes generally, as illustrated by the reduced sequence -bˆ-/ ofHabitual bˆ¤g / -bˆ¤- in (104). Note that the Future suffix is irregular in other ways as well;this may be due to its unusual historical origin (see §13.1).

Theclause begins with the question word, and ends with the noun being questioned; this maybe a demonstrative, a demonstrative NP, or a full lexical noun (examples 105-07). In theTat Deh dialect, the ‘intangible’ demonstrative yúp has a special interrogative variantyúw, as example (105b) illustrates.

        ‘What hammock (is it)?’ (EL)        The enclitic =b’ay, which appears with nominal arguments as a topic-switchmarker (§7.1.3) and with verbal predicates as an aspectual marker of a repeated action orreturn to a state (§12.9.2), occurs frequently in interrogative clauses. It is always clause-

final, and it usually occurs on a noun, as in predicate nominal content interrogatives(examples 108-9), and also in polar questions (see below). Its function in interrogatives,where it attaches to a nominal constituent, appears to be linked to its function withnominal constituents more generally; that is, it may focus attention on a selection amonga group of possible referents or options, especially in relatively emphatic contexts.

In this case, it always follows the interrogative inflection on the verb, asin examples (111-13).

For example, while (114)questions a locative phrase, (115) selects the nominal element within the locative.

         (Intended meaning: ‘Where in relation to the box is the book?’)         Questions in Hup can involve embedding. For instance, a question word canoccur in a subordinate clause, embedded within an interrogative main clause:

         Q-NMZ         see-DEP 2sg        enter-INT
         ‘What did you come in for?’ (lit. ‘what did you come in to see’) (OS)Also, in quoted speech (see §18.2.1), an interrogative clause can itself be embeddedwithin a declarative main clause:

Interrogative clauses formedwith hˆ) plus ‘say’ or ‘be like’ are irregular syntactically, as well as morphologically—theclause is subject-final, as is typical of the polar interrogative subtype (see below), despitethe fact that this is a content question (examples 119-20). This non-canonical constituentorder is probably due to the fact that hˆ) is essentially inflected by the verb itself and istherefore morphosyntactically bound to it; although certain bound morphemes can comebetween hˆ) and the verb stem ‘say’ or ‘be like’, the subject of the clause cannot and istherefore unable to precede the verb in the clause.

Polar questions with focus on predicate       This interrogative subtype solicits a yes/no answer, and is formally quite differentfrom the content questions. It does not involve a question word, and constituent order issubject-final rather than verb-final; moreover, this clause-final subject can only be apronoun (a fact that is consistent with the de-focused subject in this interrogative clausetype). Also—presumably because there is no clause-final verb—the InterrogativeBoundary Suffix -V/ is not present in this type of question. Crucially, it is the obligatorylack of the Declarative marker on the subject that defines the clause as an interrogativerather than a subject-final declarative (see §17.3.1). The clause-medial verb must take aBoundary Suffix other than Declarative -Vêh or Interrogative -V/, such as the Dynamic,Future, Negative, or Inchoative. Direct objects usually occur clause-initially; otherobjects may either precede the verb or follow it as a tacked-on external argument.","[956, 957, 958, 959, 960, 961, 962]"

In particular, the concept ‘become’ is expressed bythe verb hidoho-, and the verb ham- ‘go’ is also occasionally used in this sense, as withthe nominalized predicate adjective in example (94):

These are constituent or ‘question-word’ questions, polar(yes-no) questions with emphasis on the predicate, and polar questions with emphasis ona constituent (typically used in discursive backchanneling). The features that formallydefine the interrogative clause vis-à-vis other clause types in Hup are constituent order,the presence of a question word (interrogative pronoun, demonstrative, or adverbial), and
                                                                                                            938
the presence of the Interrogative suffix -V/, although which of these are presentdepends on the subtype of interrogative. Crucially, the Declarative suffix never occurs inan interrogative clause. Two clause-final particles (ya‡ and ti‡ ) are also used primarily ininterrogatives as discourse tags (see §15.3), and are acceptable with all three subtypes ofinterrogative clause. Most verbal inflectional forms are acceptable in interrogativeclauses, including evidentials (see §14.9).19117.4.1. Constituent (question-word) questionsThe primary function of constituent or ‘question-word’ questions is to solicit specificinformation. The formal organization of these clauses is quite distinct: the clause beginswith a question word (an interrogative pronoun, determiner, or adverbial), and—when averbal predicate is present—the clause ends with a verb inflected with the Interrogativesuffix -V/.","[952, 953, 954, 955]"
"       Moreover, the two very similar questions in (22) could have equally similarresponses, since subjects are typically dropped in Hup when responding to questions.",[738]
"       At this point in the study of Hup, the question of whether or not verb roots areunderlyingly marked for contrastive lexical tone must be left open. Tone contrasts areaccordingly not indicated on verb roots in this grammar; stressed roots, which in most
                                                                                           134
(multimorphemic) contexts are pronounced as if they simply received high tone, arealways marked as such (v¤). It is hoped that future investigation will resolve this question.","[150, 151]"

It exists in amutually exclusive relationship with the other vowel-copying Boundary Suffixes onclause-final verbs (Dynamic, Declarative, and Dependent marker suffixes; see Table17.1), as well as with the Inchoative and most other Boundary Suffixes. The intonationcontour in constituent questions is consistently highest-pitched on the clause-initialquestion word, and lowest on the clause-final verb. While a subject and, in a transitiveclause, a direct object (modified by the interrogative pronoun, see example 98 below)may be present in the initial NP, other objects or oblique arguments usually occur outsidethe main clause, as external topics following the verb (and usually uninflected).","[955, 956]"
"         The Hup question words are discussed in detail in §6.3 (Table 6.2), and aresummarized in (95) below. With the exception of the interrogative pronoun usedspecifically for human referents (/u‡y ‘who’), all of the question words are derived fromthe interrogative particle hˆ‚. In addition to appearing as focused constituents ininterrogative predicates, the question words can all stand alone as independentinterrogative utterances.",[955]
"Another, for which the relationship appears questionable on both phonetic and semanticgrounds, is Puinavé ueyu ‘day’ and Hup uerhó ‘sun’ (actually wQdhç¤). Additionalproblems with the analysis include the non-systematic mix of Nadahup languages used inthe comparison (undoubtedly due to a lack of adequate data), and the failure to appeal toregular sound correspondences—which do not seem to appear in the data at all, especiallysince clear cognates cannot even be identified as a first step. All this corroborates mybasic claim: there is at this point essentially no evidence for a relationship betweenPuinavé and the Nadahup languages, although more and better data is needed before thequestion can be settled conclusively. Currently, work on Puinavé is being carried out byJésus Mario Girón Higuita at the University of Amsterdam, which will perhaps yieldsome answers to these questions.",[28]
"For example, (31) was uttered by a teenage boy in answer to my question ‘why did youquit school?’. Similarly, the speaker in (32) had been telling me how she had fallen outwith the people of another village, but would give no more details when I asked ‘why didthey scold/ yell at you?’.

"       However, Hup does have several inherently negative lexical items andexpressions, in addition to the negative particles already discussed in this chapter. Thefixed negative phrase /ám ya/a‡pa/ is commonly used in response to questions to mean ‘Idon’t know’. Its etymology is obscure, but it appears to involve the second personsingular pronoun /ám, and possibly the form ya/a‡p ‘that’s all; that much’.",[916]
"       This historical scenario is supported by a number of ambiguous contextsinvolving teg that currently exist in Hup, such as the purpose clauses given above (e.g.example 20). Moreover, certain irregular occurrences of the form teg can be explained inlight of its history as a nominal form. Questions involving identity and purpose are onesuch example of an irregular—and potentially ambiguous—use of teg. The question“what kind of tree/thing is that?” is formally and pragmatically similar to the question“what will you do with that/ what is that for?” in example (22) (stress denoted byunderlining):
(22)   (a)      hˆ-n’ˆ‡h   teg     yúp=b’ay?
                Q-NMZ      thing   that=AGAIN

                Q-NMZ      FUT     that=AGAIN
                ‘What will you do with that (thing)? / What is that for?’ (OS/EL)Note that (22a), “what kind of tree/thing is that?”, is a normal nominal identity question,in which teg follows the same stress pattern as any other noun, as we can see incomparison with example (23).

(23)   hˆ-n’ˆ‡h     hç‚p     yúp=b’ay?
       Q-NMZ        fish     that=AGAIN
       ‘What kind of fish is that?’ (OS)However, (22b) is crucially a verbal construction, and its form is irregular in comparisonto other questions involving verbs because it involves only a verbal suffix, without a verbstem, as comparison with example (24) shows157.
(24)   hˆ-n’ˆ‡h      /am bˆ/-tég?
       Q-NMZ         2sg      make-FUT
       ‘What are you going to make?’(OS/EL)In the purpose question in (22b), the mere presence of stress on -teg is arguably enoughto give it a verbal identity; in addition, the semantics of purpose correspond to thesemantics of future.","[737, 738]"

The Emphatic Coordinator is especially common when providing an‘it just is’ type of answer, using the ‘no reason’ particle hi); for example, a teenageranswered my question, ‘Why did you leave school?’ with (24). The function of theEmphatic Coordinator in these instances is not completely clear, but it may serve to linkthe response back to the preceding discourse, or even to the question itself.

Adversative Conjunction ka‡hHup speakers use the adversative conjunction-like form ka‡h198 (‘but, though, on the otherhand’) to signal a semantic opposition to a previous clause or assertion in discourse, andit can also occur in expressions of disjunction (usually in combination with thedisjunctive marker /ó; see §18.1.5 below). Use of Adversative ka‡h is limited to197
   Consultants who speak Portuguese identify this as a Portuguese borrowing.

   A phonetically identical form kah appears in the verb compound kah-k´d-´y (kah + ‘pass’) ‘step over

resemblance is anything other than homonymy.

"6.2. Interrogative pronouns and question wordsWhile they can functionally be considered as a single set, Hup question words formallyfall into two distinct sets. They are built on only two basic forms, /u‡y ‘who’, usedexclusively for animate (almost always human) referents, and the interrogative particlehˆ‚. In form, morphological patterning, and semantics, /u‡y is essentially a personalpronoun with properties closely resembling those of the other pronouns given in §6.1above (i.e. primarily human reference, inflecting for case, possession, etc.).83 Theinterrogative particle hˆ‚, on the other hand, patterns formally with the demonstratives(§6.3 below), as is evident from Table 4.2 in §4.1.2, and from the tables in §6.3 below.",[382]

17.3. Declarative clausesThis section treats the declarative clause in Hup. Declarative clauses are defined both byconstituent order and morphological marking, and include both affirmative and negativestatements, as well as non-verbal clauses involving predicate nominals, adjectives, andlocatives.
                                                                                          905
17.3.1. Constituent order in the declarative clauseConstituent order in Hup is relatively free, but the formally least-marked pattern is clearlyverb-final. Defining the order of nominal arguments in the transitive clause is moredifficult, but the ‘basic’ constituent order can arguably be identified as AOV. The actualorder of all constituents appears to be determined primarily by pragmatics, with the mostimportant parameter being the fronting of new information. Other relevant factors thatcorrelate with word order are verbal tense and aspect, and the identity of nominalconstituents as pronouns or full lexical nouns. Both context and the existence ofmorphological core case-marking (see §4.3.1), which corresponds to a consistentlynominative-accusative alignment system, help to disambiguate syntactic arguments.","[921, 922]"
"       In defining a given set of compounds, this question of figure and ground translatesinto the question of which slot in the compound—the slot expressing the different typesof leaves, or the different parts of a tree—is likely to be more salient in speakers’ dailylives. For Hup speakers, as discussed in §5.4.3, the most prototypical paradigmaticoppositions in plant-part compounds involve a constant form as the second member of
                                                                                             349
the compound (N2) and a varied set of forms as the first member (N1); moreover, thestress pattern (where N1 receives primary stress) reflects the fact that the speaker’sattention is more likely to correspond to the variable form than the constant one. Thishigher salience of one paradigm type over the other reflects the typical interaction ofspeakers with their environment: a Hup speaker is much more likely to be concernedabout the identity of a leaf or stick, because that is crucial to what he or she can do ormake with that object.","[365, 366]"
"        The verb g’ç)h- is used as the functional equivalent of ni- ‘be, exist’ (see example32) in Tat Deh and elsewhere in the Eastern dialect region, as well as in Umari Norte(Western region), but is not in general used at all in the Central dialect. It is likely thatg’ç)h- is an older, native form of the verb ‘be, exist’, but this question remains open.",[495]

18. Clause combining       Hup has a rich repertoire of strategies for combining clauses. Mechanismsinvolve coordination, subordination, and cosubordination, including what may be bestcharacterized as clause-chaining. This chapter begins with a discussion of coordinationin Hup, then moves on to subordination and cosubordination, where at least one clause isdependent on another. Hup has an especially wide selection of (co)subordinationstrategies for indicating temporal overlap or succession of events.","[981, 982, 983]"

"        Given that significant differences between subtypes of bound-noun NPs andadjectival NPs are possible in Hup, the question of whether the two constructions shouldthemselves be considered one and the same becomes less meaningful. Instead, it makesmore sense to consider them as distinct types of NP that simply share a number offeatures. In fact, upon closer inspection, quite a few differences between them can beidentified.",[430]
"The primary function of this form is to signal entry into a relatively long-term or (semi-)permanent state. With an active verb, this long-term state is understood to be the result ofthe event in question.",[672]

"       In its more common interrogative function, ya‡ acts as an emphatic tag. It isjudged to be almost interchangeable with the interrogative emphasis particle ti‡(§15.3.1.1), although it is considered somewhat more emphatic. Interrogative ya‡ isespecially common in rhetorical questions (asked not so much for information as forrhetorical effect), but it is also used when asking an information question emphatically. Itfollows a complete interrogative clause (whether a polar or a content question; see§17.4), and often co-occurs with other clause-internal emphasis markers (e.g. =pog inexample 124).

The Focus marker -áh sometimes occurs on a clause-final pronoun when followed byya‡ (example 128), and can also can appear on a verbal predicate followed by ya‡, in placeof the usual Interrogative marker -V/ (example 129).

               (I-M.15)       Like most other clause-final particles, ya‡ is morphosyntactically bound to thepreceding predicate, and cannot be separated from it by an address term or other material:

In these clauses, (-V)yá takes the place of therequired suffix material (usually the Declarative marker -Vêh) on post-verbal subjects inaffirmative clauses. It combines directly with verbs as an ‘internally complex’ BoundarySuffix, requiring a copied vowel to come between itself and the verb stem (example 132).

"       This combination is rare but occasionally occurs, as in example (58). Here, thespeaker is emphasizing the fact that the person in question has gone away from thevillage, in the direction away from the river. The final stem ‘go’ is presumably moreresultative (i.e. he’s gone away), while the person’s direction is less time-stable orimportant in the long run.

"       The dropping of arguments is common in Hup when they can be recovered fromthe discourse context; this is particularly true for objects (example 1). Subject droppingalso occurs (example 2), but is less frequent. In general, Hup speakers seem to preferclauses with only one full nominal (i.e. non-pronominal) argument, and will sometimeseven repeat the clause, dropping an argument each time, in order to conform to this(example 3). In providing information in response to a question or related solicitationfrom an interlocutor, an utterance may consist of only a verb (plus inflection), or only anoun or adjective, but in most other discourse contexts a predicate with at least onenominal argument (usually the subject) is the norm.

This order is oftenfavored when the clause encodes an ongoing or currently relevant event, and particularlywhen the subject is a pronoun; these clauses are therefore common in everydayconversation, but quite infrequent in narrative and other types of discourse. In suchcases, the verb is usually marked with the Dynamic suffix -Vêy, but other BoundarySuffixes are possible (e.g. Inchoative -ay, Negative -nˆ¤h, etc.).","[922, 923]"
"       These ‘Acting alone’ markers are relatively rare in discourse and are not yet wellunderstood. They appear to be essentially interchangeable and functionally the same,although -d’a‡h may imply a more brief duration of the event. Examples of their use aregiven in (167-69). Note that the analogous expression if the speaker wishes to solicitcompany (rather than announcing that he/she will go alone) would involve theCooperative suffix -nˆ‡N (167b; see §14.5).

15.3.8. Acquiescence particle béThis particle, like the two described above, is poorly understood. It occurs quitefrequently in the expression h´‡/ bé ‘OK!’ where it marks acquiescence to an imperative(while affirmative h´‡/ by itself can signal either acquiescence or an affirmative answerto a question). This is illustrated by speaker B’s response to A’s imperative in example(170):(170) A: nˆN         pˆnˆN-d’´h-áy=mah,            tˆ¤h-a‡n!

In this case, it may indicateacquiescence in the sense that the speaker has made up his mind to do something aftersome deliberation; however, this is as yet unclear. It is hoped that future investigationwill shed more light on the functions of this and the two equally mysterious ‘Actingalone’ particles described above.(171) yam-/e/-ke/          bé

15.4. Grammaticalized social connectednessQuite a number of grammaticalized forms in Hup arguably have a primary—or at least avery frequently exploited—function of indicating social relationships among participants.","[873, 874, 875]"
"Historical Note       The grammaticalization story of the Hup classifying nouns, from nominal headsto something resembling encliticized modifiers, has been outlined above in §5.6.4.1. Inthis Historical Note, I consider the question of what may have served to trigger thisprocess of metaphorical extension and reanalysis. Three main catalysts can be identified.",[372]
"        In spite of the fact that the Hup strategy thus appears to be motivated, we are stillleft with the question of why Hup privileges this realization of inalienability, while somany languages of the world approach the same phenomenon from a differentperspective. I suggest that we can consider these grammatical choices as meetinglanguage-specific functional constraints, comparable to the ranked phonologicalconstraints proposed by Optimality Theory. In other words, Hup ranks a focus on highlyanimate (i.e. human) entities above the iconic encoding of inherent possession. Thedistinct treatment of human entities and human body parts with respect to alienability inHup is in keeping with the special focus on humanness found in Hup grammar generally;compare the sensitivity of human referents to object and number marking (see §4.3.1.2).",[349]
"       Other examples include (51), which was uttered in response to my question ofwhy a dog had died; it was starving, and had entered the stage being on the edge of death,with no recovery expected. The same thing is sometimes said of people who are very oldor terminally ill, once they reach the stage of being bed-ridden. Likewise, example (52)was in reference to a small child who had reached the stage of having learned to walk.",[673]

  According to the conventions for indicating morpheme juncture in this grammar (as noted in §1.7), the
hyphen (-) marks affixation and compounding of verb stems, the equals (=) marks cliticization and bound
nouns, and a blank space marks the juncture between a word and a particle, as well as between most
elements of noun phrases (other than bound nouns).

       This chapter focuses on the architecture of the Hup word: the parts that makeup the word and the details of their combination. It begins with a discussion of the basicparts of speech or word classes, and then moves to the definition of the phonologicalword and the question of polysemy vs. homonymy of forms. This provides the contextfor the discussion of formative classes, of the flexibility of certain morphemes to varytheir form class within the verb, and finally, of the implications of this last phenomenonfor grammaticalization.","[169, 170]"
"        There are thus clearly good arguments for positing a series of glottalizedconsonants in Hup to explain these phenomena. But one more question remains: why isvoicing neutralized with the glottalized stops? This can be explained as motivated byphonetic distinctiveness (audibility). In word-final position, to begin with, the glottalizedconsonants surface as unreleased stops, and as such are too phonetically similar to theunreleased voiceless stops for a contrast to be maintained. As Blevins (2004: 99) hasnoted, for plain obstruents and ejective or glottalized obstruents to contrast in word-finalposition, the stops must be audibly released. In fact, syllable-final neutralization ofejective or glottalized obstruents as voiceless unaspirated obstruents—as we findmorpheme-finally in Hup—is crosslinguistically quite common (Blevins 2004: 94).",[122]

"       The default use of the Ventive suffix involves movement toward the speaker. Inmost uses, such as with the Dynamic suffix -Vêy, the Ventive marker indicates a fullcircuit—the actor has gone somewhere, performed the activity, and returned. Note that,in keeping with this sense, it would be ungrammatical for a speaker at point B to use the-/ay- form in reference to an activity which an addressee who began at point A hasperformed en route to B. For example, one conventionally uses the question ham-/áy-áy/ám? (go-VENT-DYNM 2sg) ‘have you gone and come back?’ to greet a member of one’sown village who has returned after an absence (i.e. who has gone from B to A and backto B), but not to greet a visitor from another village (who has only gone from A to B).",[696]

   Corresponding to a general morphophonological process in Hup, an epenthetic glottal stop or
homorganic consonant marks the morpheme/ syllable boundary, here and in all other cases (including the
demonstratives in the tables below) where a bound form precedes an obstruent-initial inflectional
morpheme (see §2.6). The glottal stop is not written in the transcription.

   This use of hˆ‚ with the verb ‘be like’ occurs in the Tat Deh dialect area, but not in that of Barreira Alta,
where speakers use hˆ‚pê =yˆ/ nˆ¤h- instead.

‘in what way, how’s that?’; compare yˆnˆy ‘thus, in this way’ from demonstrative yu-/yˆ-.

These forms also occur in non-interrogativeclauses as indefinite pronouns (§6.4 below).","[383, 384]"
"        It is difficult to resolve these questions definitively, since there are few syntacticclues to headedness in Hup. However, to the extent that heads can be determined at all,
                                                                                         413
there is actually no reason to think that head-modifier order cannot vary within theHup NP; in fact, such syntactic inconsistency already exists among different subtypes ofthe bound noun constructions. In §5.6, I argue that the semantic head of the bound-nounNP may be ambiguous, and that for many NPs involving classifying bound nouns, thisambiguity has fostered a switch of the syntactic head of the construction from N2 to N1.","[429, 430]"
"       The other primary feature that distinguishes the verb class from other parts ofspeech is the relative unimportance of tonal contrast on verb roots. However, asdiscussed in §2.3.2.2, there are in fact a few minimal pairs of verb roots that aredistinguished by tone, as in example (1):(1)    túk-    ‘want’
       tu‡k-   ‘sting (insect)’Furthermore, tone values are clearly distinguished on verb stems in Apprehensive mode(see §14.6). As discussed in §2.3.2.2, it is likely that underlying tone values are in factpresent for most verb roots in Hup (at least those that can act as the unique stem in a verbword, rather than being obligatorily part of a compound), but are simply much less salientthan they are for other parts of speech. A probable reason for this low salience is the factthat verb stems are almost never word-final (because they usually require a followingBoundary Suffix), whereas word-final position is the primary environment fordistinguishing tonal contrasts generally in Hup. These questions of verbal tone in Hupwill have to await future research.",[478]
"       Examples (1-3) below illustrate the prototypical use of Dynamic -Vêy to markevents as current and on-going in the context of the moment of speech, and they alsooutline some of the factors governing the choice of the Dynamic over the Declarative. Asexample (1) illustrates, on-going events, marked with the Dynamic suffix, can becontrasted with events that took place at some point in the past and are not currently on-going, which are typically unspecified for aspect and marked with the Declarative suffix-Vhê . Example (2a) is a typical yes-no question, in which the verb appears clause-medially in its Dynamic form (note that the Declarative is ungrammatical here bothbecause the verb is not clause-final and because the clause is interrogative); (2b) is theexpected response given that the event that is currently in progress. Finally, (3) illustratesthe co-occurrence of the Dynamic and Declarative markers within the same clause, where-Vêh marks the end of the clause and Dynamic -Vêy marks the verb itself. This non-verb-final clause structure is especially common in discourse relating to current, on-going

       ‘He’s lying, that one, daughter!’ (B-Cv.2.7)       The dynamic or imperfective-like aspectual function of the -Vêy suffix is especiallyapparent with predicate adjectives. As discussed in §3.1.3 and §10.1, adjectives patternmuch like verbs in their inflectional properties, although unlike verbs they do not requirea Boundary Suffix. When an adjective is inflected by the Dynamic suffix, the state orcharacteristic it indicates is understood to have a dynamic quality, whereas the adjectiveby itself (or when nominalized by the 3sg preform tˆh=, see §6.6) is more likely torepresent a permanent or inherent characteristic. This is consistent with Chung andTimberlake’s observation (1985: 216) that a state may be conceived as dynamic andexpressed by means of progressive or other imperfective morphology when it is
                                                                                            642
“accidental, temporary, or subject to change”. The examples in (4-6) illustrate thedynamic interpretation of adjectives marked by -Vêy. This is contrasted with theiruninflected forms; expressing the inherent softness of someone’s feet or the redness of aflower with the Dynamic marker is judged extremely odd by consultants.

       As a Boundary Suffix, Dynamic -Vêy co-occurs with most other aspectualdistinctions. This is formally possible since the majority of these are realized as InnerSuffixes (obligatorily followed by a Boundary Suffix) or as peripheral formatives(obligatorily preceded by a Boundary Suffix). Semantically, when -Vêy co-occurs withother aspect or time-related markers, it functions primarily to indicate the currently
                                                                                            643
dynamic and on-going nature of the proposition or the event’s result, usually withinthe temporal context of the speech act—rather than the internal temporal consistency ofthe event itself. Thus while -Vêy itself relates to aspect, its function is more basic than thatof most other aspect markers in Hup. In contrast to Dynamic -Vêy, other BoundarySuffixes that occur in its place (and in mutual exclusion with it) may indicate a differenttemporal context; e.g. Declarative -Vêh often implies (but does not entail) a past event, andthe Future marker -teg / -te- indicates a future event.","[657, 658, 659, 660]"
"       A number of aspects of Hup grammar are typologically unusual, as well asintriguing from an areal perspective. These include the treatment of possessed body parts(animal body parts are inalienably possessed, while human body parts are alienable; see§5.4.5), word order inversion patterns in question formation (see §17.4), thepolyfunctionality of many morphemes (e.g. §3.3), and several unusual paths ofgrammaticalization that create such unique historical links as between the noun ‘stick,tree’ and a verbal future suffix (§13.1), and between an evidential and a nominal markerindicating a deceased referent (§14.9.3). Other features, such as the heavy effects of arealdiffusion on Hup grammar (but much less on its lexicon) are also interesting from both across-linguistic and a regional point of view. Hup is a good illustration of the value ofresearch on little-known and endangered languages, which can provide us with new waysof thinking about languages in general.

1.2. Hup within the Nadahup (Maku) language familyHup belongs to the Nadahup or Maku family (see §1.2.1 below for a discussion of thefamily name). Its closest relative is Yuhup, followed by Dâw, then Nadëb, as shown inFigure 1.1.

For example, thecompound ‘clothing of sores’ (which were worn as a disguise by a mythical hero) in (21)corresponds to the compounds in (20).
                                                                                          285

       Why do the productive compounds and the lexically specific compounds haveopposite stress patterns? The most plausible answer to this question is that when acompound is perceived as part of a variable, paradigmatic set, the second or constantcomponent is in some sense perceived as given or backgrounded information, while thefirst or variable component is relatively foregrounded. The stress pattern reflects thespeaker’s perception of this difference, in that he/she naturally pays more attention to thevariable component (this point is taken up again in §5.4.2).","[300, 301, 302]"
"       Other features of adjectival NPs that differentiate them from purely nominal NPsinclude their stress pattern: while bound noun constructions with a full noun as N1typically have primary stress either on the N1 only, or on both members of the compoundconstruction (e.g. tiyi‡/=dó/ (man=child) ‘male child’), stress in noun + adjective NPsusually falls on the adjective (this difference can be seen in example 129 above). Yetanother difference involves the verbal negation strategy, which can be applied toadjective modifiers within NPs (see 119 above); in the case of bound nouns, on the otherhand, the entire NP (and not simply the bound noun within it) must be negated by anominal negation strategy. Finally, another difference is the fact that unmodifiedadjectives—unlike bound nouns—do not directly follow a numeral acting as N1(although they can follow a demonstrative, see above). Instead, the adjective appears innominalized form with tˆh=, as in (130).

       ‘She has two big ones.’ (EL)       The differences between the adnominal adjectives and the bound nouns aresummarized in Table 6.9.

       Another noteworthy feature of adjectives in NPs (which also helps to differentiatethem from most bound nouns) is their ability to occur in an explicitly nominalized formin association with other nouns. This results in a noun phrase composed of [N tˆh=Adj].","[431, 432]"
"       The fact that adjective modifiers must take an explicit preceding nominal, forwhich the default is the tˆh= preform, gives them a formal resemblance to bound (andinalienably possessed) nouns in Hup (see §5.4). Compare, for example, the human noun‘child’ and the adjective ‘big’ in the nominal constructions in (129):
(129) a)       tiyi‡/=dó/      ‘male child’
               tˆh=dó/         ‘child’       b)      tiyi/ po‡g      ‘big man’
               tˆh=po‡g        ‘big one’       Functionally, too, there are parallels between the two constructions. Theprototypical bound noun construction signals an inherent relationship between twoentities, where the first possesses and/or defines the second (e.g. in a whole-partrelationship; see §5.5); likewise the adjective denotes a property that is inseparable fromthe entity that ‘possesses’ it, and may be difficult or impossible to even conceptualizewithout some kind of physical embodiment. Similarly, the association indicated by thebound noun construction also helps to individuate the entity in question from other
                                                                                                412
entities like it (i.e. by restricting a set), just as the denotation of a property may have arestrictive function, helping to pick out an individual referent from the set of possiblereferents—although adjectives do not just restrict reference, but also enrich the semanticsof a known entity.","[428, 429]"
"       In addition to this, languages may grammaticalize situationally dependent socialconnectedness or deixis, where the relationship is specific to the activity in question or iscreated in the context of the speech event itself (second-person pronouns and honorificscan have this ‘relatively creative’ function as well as their more common ‘presupposing’one). In general, grammaticalized forms of specifically situationally dependent socialconnectedness do not seem to be particularly common cross-linguistically, or are at least
                                                                                              859
not well described. Some examples do exist, however; for instance, the Arawaklanguage Tariana is reported to have ‘sociative’ serial verb constructions, in which thesecond stem in the serial construction is the verb ‘be together’ (Aikhenvald 2002). Also,in Tukang Besi (Indonesia), the ‘social activity prefix’ hopo- “implies that an action isdone for a social or ceremonial function, and not just for purely personal goals”(Donahue 1999: 283), and Tarahumara (Mexico) is reported to have a co-ordinator whichis used “when harmony and/or good fellowship are implied between the conjuncts”(Thord-Gray 1955: 516; J. Payne 1985b: 25).","[875, 876]"
