1.1.1.2.1.2.2 Expecting the answer no
Yes-no questions which expect the answer no have the structure of a
negative declarative sentence, plus a sentence-final question particle. The
question particles, kaf and d:J, are identical with those of the correspond-
ing yes-no questions that expect the answer yes. Since the correspondence
is so regular, only a single example is given here, in (23).

1.1.1.2.1.2.1 Expecting the answer yes
The yes-no questions suggesting a positive response are formed syntacti-
cally in an identical way to the neutral yes-no questions (i.e. positive de-
clarative sentence plus sentence-final question particle), but use different
question particles. There are two particles, kal and d:J which are used in
this type of yes-no question. Both particles are also words in their own
right: kal is a comparative particle meaning 'rather' or 'more (than)', and
d:J is the negative copula or emphatic particle (corresponding to the posi-
tive particle La). The examples given in (17}--(22) correspond to those in
the (positive) declarative sentences (5)-(10) and the neutral questions
(11)-( 16). Note that the position of the question particle (always sentence-
final) is the same in all types of yes-no questions. Here, only examples
with kal have been given; the examples with d:J are identical when the
question particle is switched.

1.1.1.2.4.2.1 Yes-no questions
1.1.1.2.4.2.1.1 Wordsfor yes', 'no', 'maybe'
The words for 'yes' and 'no' in Koromfe vary slightly (stylistically?) in
their phonetic realization - I have therefore transcribed them in greater
phonetic detail than usual. Also, these words are accompanied by a dis-
tinctive intonation pattern, which I have marked with high and low tone
marks, where appropriate, in the examples given here. It seems that the
most important thing about these words is that when disyllabic, 'yes' al-
ways has a rising tone pattern (LH) and 'no' a falling pattern (HL).

1.1.1.2.4.2.1.2 The use of yes' and 'no' in reply to negative and other
leading questions
The answer 'no' to a negative leading question such as (23), repeated here
for convenience, means that the speaker agrees with the negated proposi-                                                                           33

"1.1.1.2.4.1 Answers as a distinct speech act
Answers cannot be considered to be a distinct type of speech act from a
structural point of view, i.e. there is no special structural distinction be-
tween indicative sentences and answers, except that answers can be ellip-
tical (see § 1.1.1.2.4.2. below). Typically, a reply to a question-word ques-
tion will involve the topicalizing/emphatic particle la, and a reply to a yes-
no question some kind of yes/no/maybe word (see § 1.1.1.2.4.2.1.1. be-
low).",[68]
"1.11.3 Focus of a yes-no question
I have never found nor been able to elicit a focused yes-no question, even
though my suspicion is it ought to be possible to stick a yes-no question
particle on the end of any sentence whatsoever. However, it is possible to
use a yes-no question immediately following a topic NP, as in (365).

1.1.1.2.3 Echo-questions
Echo-questions usually take the same form as the corresponding direct
yes-no and wh-questions. But also, the question particle (bl etc.) can be

these specific echo-questions is given in the following sub-sections.
    The restrictions on the structure of echo-questions are the same as
those on normal yes-no and wh-questions. There seem to be no additional
restrictions on in situ echo-questions, so long as the corresponding normal
wh-question (with movement) is also well-formed.
    A strategy which my informants preferred was to avoid echo-questions
by using a paraphrase involving the verb say, on the lines of 'Did you say:
X?' or 'Where do you say you are going?'.","[64, 65]"

1.3.1.1.3 Or-coordination
In indicative sentences the coordinator is maa, and the structure S) - maa
- S2. There also exists an either-or structure, namely maa - S) - maa
- S2, exemplified in (246) below.
    In alternative yes-no questions it is possible to juxtapose sentences;
there is also a coordinator jaa that is specific to such yes-no questions.
Both structures are exemplified in § 1.1.1.2.1.3 above.","[124, 125]"
"1.1.1.2.1 Yes-no questions
1.1.1.2.1.1 Neutral
Neutral yes-no questions in Koromfe are formed by adding a sentence-
final question particle (glossed as QUEST. below) to a (positive) declarative
sentence. There is no inversion or other change in the linear order of the
sentence constituents. A set of typical declarative sentences with varying
numbers and types of noun phrases are given in (5}--(10), and the corre-
sponding neutral yes-no questions in (11}--( 16).

         'The dog came/comes (back).'",[47]
"     In these alternative yes-no questions, the question particle hI is always
on a high pitch. (NB: Unlike other Gur languages, Koromfe has no tones.)
Also, there is a slight pause, or pause effect, after hI. Note the variations
(all optional) in the tense of the repeated verb and even in the choice of16

as grammaticalized as, say, tag questions in English.
    There also exists an optional coordinating element jaa which, if used,
is positioned at the beginning of the second clause (i.e. after the short
pause after hI). An example is given in (30).

"    Reduced answers to wh-questions involve the omiSSion of noun-
phrases or prepositional phrases vis-a-vis the full answer, or the replace-
ment of noun-phrases by pronouns, much the same as in English. How-
ever, the use of pronouns is not obligatory. In (78) and (79) (both sen-
tences being typical reduced answers to question (75», the direct object
'rice' is completely omitted.",[69]
"    With the positive leading questions, 'yes' means agreement with the
positive proposition and 'no' means disagreement.
    In general, I have not noticed any unexpected use of 'yes' or 'no' in
Koromfe vis-a-vis English usage.",[69]
"1.1.1.2.4.2.2 Question-word questions
When considering the reduction of answers to wh-questions it is practical
to treat questioned noun-phrases and prepositional phrases separately from
questioned verbs.",[69]
"1.1.1.2 Interrogative sentences
The typical intonation pattern for all types of question in Koromfe is not
normally distinct from that of statements (cf. §3.3.4.1.1-2 below), i.e. a
high pitch at the beginning of the sentence, followed by a gradual fall of
pitch up to the end of the question. This means that in general all question
words at the beginning of a sentence are on a high pitch, and all yes-no
question particles at the end of a sentence have a low pitch. In addition,
the high pitch on the sentence-initial wh-e1ement remains at a constant
high pitch on the whole syntactic constituent.
    Optionally, the sentence-final question particle can be on a high pitch
or lengthened, in which case the question is especially emphasized.",[47]
"1.1.1.2.4.2.2.1 Questioned noun phrases and prepositional phrases
As mentioned above, the answer to a wh-questioned noun-phrase normally
involves emphasis with the emphatic particle la (or dJ, if negative). If the
answer is a full sentence, the answer element is emphasized (Le. moved to
the front of the main clause and followed by la). An example question is
given in (75) and its full answer in (76).

question-answer sequence is given in (568).",[274]

1.1.1.2.3.3 Yes-no question echo-questions
My informants were reluctant to form yes-no echo-questions without some
introductory expression indicating 'Did you say X' or 'Do you mean X'.
In examples (70)-(71) the first word, handa, is such an expression.

3.3.4.1.2 Yes-no question intonation
The intonation of yes-no questions is identical to that of statements exem-
plified above, with the exception that the sentence-final question particle
(such as [bID can optionally have a high pitch, and is often lengthened.
Both modifications imply a more insistent kind of questioning.","[468, 469]"
"1.1.1.2.4 Answers
Answers in Koromfe can take the form of full or incomplete sentences.
The full sentence answers have the structure of the declarative sentence
32
                                                                       Syntax
corresponding to the question itself. In the following sub-sections, the
incomplete answers are described in more detail.","[67, 68]"
"The minimal reply to such a question has the form 'NP verb la', as shown
in (85), where NP is the subject noun phrase of the sentence (or, option-
ally, a pronoun substitute) and verb is finite. It is impossible to omit this
subject NP in answer to a question such as (84) (e.g. *gondu la). Note that
in (85) the emphatic particle la qualifies a finite verb.
     If an embedded verb phrase is questioned, however, it is possible
(marginally) to have a gerund (i.e. non-finite) verb form, as exemplified in
the question-answer pair (86)-(87).

1.1.1.3 Imperative sentences
There are two normal ways of forming an imperative sentence in Koromfe:
either with a true imperative (which is restricted to the 2nd person, singu-
lar or plural) or with a full sentence (in all persons) introduced by the
conjunction ke. In §1.1.1.3.1.1 a third possibility, with the omission of ke,
is described; my informants never gave such imperative forms spontane-
ously. In effect, they are just declarative sentences used as imperatives.",[71]
"2.1.8.1.6 Sentence particles
There are two types of particle which might be considered sentence parti-
cles: the sentence-final interrogative particles and the preverbal negative
particles (ba and arguably also aa). The interrogative particles are de-
scribed in § 1.1.1.2.1 and the negative particles in § 1.4.1. I do not consider
the (apparently) sentence-initial particle handa of the yes-no question
echo-questions in § 1.1.1.2.3.3 to be truly sentence-initial, but rather to be
an ellipsis of something like n handa bole ke ... 'Did you really say that...',
where handa is a pre-verbal adverb (cf. § 1.2.1.3 .2.1 above).",[349]
"2.1.8.2.3 Sentence-final
The interrogative particles of the various types of yes-no questions
(described in § 1.1.1.2.1) occupy the sentence-final position.",[350]
"
                                                                                      459
Phonology3.5 MorphophonoJogy (suprasegmentaJ)
Stress is not affected by morphological processes and compounding, and
Koromfe has no tones. There are no changes in the segmental pattern due
to the intonation pattern, with the exception of the lengthened yes-no
question particle described in § 1.1.1.2.1.1 above. Therefore the rest of
§3.S of the questionnaire is inapplicable.","[494, 495]"
"1.1.1.2.2.1.1 Constituents of the main clause
Any NP or PP of a main clause can be questioned. The verb or VP can
only be questioned indirectly (see (39) below). Adverbial questions are
restricted to 'where', 'when' and 'how', plus the questioning of the post-
position in a PP. Other adverbial questions such as 'why' involve ques-
tioned NPs.
    The following examples show the questioning of a whole noun-phrase
as subject (31), direct object (32)-(33) and indirect object (34).",[52]
"Interestingly, a postposition can itself also be questioned, as shown in
(55). A typical answer would then be 'in front of it' or 'behind it'.
(55)     a      d1iI.J      ""kol]              nde         hi

         'In what direction to the house is he sitting?' or 'Which way to the house is he
         sitting?'",[61]
"
1.1.1.2.2 Question-word questions
There are two basic types ofwh-questions: those in which the (constituent
containing the) wh-element is moved to the beginning of the clause (main
or embedded), and those in which the wh-element remains at its original
position in the sentence (in situ wh-questions).",[52]
"2.1.1.4 The expression o/non-local semantic/unctions
2.1.1.4.1 Bene/active
The benefactive is expressed by the postposition nt: (with phonological
variants ne, nI and ni), e.g. the question-answer pair in (384)-(385).
(384)   ala       ill            I]        kone       (a)           dIU

        DET. NON-HUM. SG.",[188]
"1.2.1.3.2 The positional possibilities for adverbials within the sentence
1.2.1.3.2.1 Adverbs
Adverbs fall into three distinct classes on distributional grounds, and each
class has related semantic characteristics. (Note that clause-final in the
following sub-sections excludes the sentence-final yes-no question parti-
cles, which are always the very last thing in a sentence.)1.2.1.3.2.1.1 Pre-verbal verbal adverbs
This class of adverbs includes the adverbs da 'in the past', handa 'truly' ,28
and occurs before the (first) finite verb of a clause (with the exception of
handa when used as an exclamation outside normal sentence structure -
cf. the pre-sentential echo-question usage of handa in § 1.1.1.2.3.3 above).
This is also the position where the negative particle ba occurs when it
qualifies the verb. In the rare event that more than one of these co-occur,
they have the order handa - da - ba.
Sentence (201) below contains an example of da. The adverb handa is
exemplified in (200).
(200)    d;}                handa we d;}              we
         PRON. 3SG. HUM.    really be PRON. 3SG. HUM. be
         'He really existed, he existed!'",[107]
"1.1.1.2.2.2.1 No change
The questioned element is left unchanged only in echo-questions (where it
is the only possible structure - cf. § 1.1.1.2.3 below) and in parts of dou-
ble questions (cf. § 1.1.1.2.2.1.6 above).",[63]
"
1.1.1.2.2.1.2 Constituents o/subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, it is possible, and usual, to question in situ those
words and phrases which in single-clause questions must occur sentence-
initially (see the 'a' examples in (40)-{43) below). However, it is also
possible to move the wh-word or phrase from an embedded non-subject
position to the embedded-clause-initial position (see the 'b' forms of (40)--
(43», or to the matrix-clause-initial position the (the 'c' forms of (40)--
(43» - except for the embedded subject, which can only be questioned in
subordinate-clause-initial position (which is also in situ). In other words,
an embedded subject NP cannot be moved at all. If an ambiguous se-
quence of constituents results from wh-movement, the wh-word is inter-
preted with the matrix, not the embedded sentence, e.g. in (42b).
     Recall that the emphatic particle la, which is found in many of these
examples, is optional in all question-word clauses. However, since it only
occurs in 'clause-second' position, it can never follow an in situ wh-word
that is located to the right of the verb (e.g. an unmoved direct or indirect
object).",[54]
"1.1.1.2.3.6 Echo-questioning of more than one element at a time
It is possible to echo-question a double question only insofar as double or
multiple questions are tolerated at all (cf. § 1.1.1.2.2.1.6 above).",[67]
"2.1.2.6.2 Other question words
There is never any differences between the forms of question words used
in direct and indirect questions. The other question words are listed in
table (616).
(616)   Other question words        question word   gloss                         question word   gloss        nde             'where'                     rk:Jl             'how much'

unable to locate any source for the fu part of the word.
    The 1 of Ibl seems to be the same morpheme (possibly the 'basic non-
human' plural suffix -I used as a prefix) which can be found at the begin-
ning of all cardinal numerals from 2 to 9.
    The word na1)kaa looks like a compound of naN (found in the deictics
nandl and na1)sa - cf. §2.1.1.10.1 above) and a reduced version of the
word kana; in other words, the two words for 'how' are basically the same
word.",[299]

                                Preface
This book is the result of 16 years of work on Koromfe, alongside other
linguistic interests. It would not have been possible without the active and
passive support of several people. I would especially like to thank my
family, who increased during those years from 2 to 5 (other) members, for
their active interest in the early stages and for their patience during the
final stages.
    Annemarie Schweeger-Hefel (t) put her house in Tulfes, Tyrol at my
disposal for my first informant sessions and provided me with background
information on the culture of the Koromba without which I would have
been lost.
    A grammar of this kind is never 'finished', especially for a perfec-
tionist like myself, and writing it has raised many further questions which
I wish I had the time and resources to try to answer. I thank my informants
for their help and Bernard Comrie, the series editor, for his extremely
attentive inspection of the manuscript and suggestions for revisions, which
were always to the point and well-received. Special thanks go to Oskar
Pfeiffer for his diligent proofreading of the manuscript. Of course, the
entire responsibility for what is written here is my own, and I absolve all
others from any part of the blame for the faults that may remain.
    I would welcome feedback from anyone working on related languages

1.1.1.2.2.2 Changes to the questioned element
The questioned element is moved to sentence-initial position in nonnal
wh-questions (see examples (32)-{34) above), but can be left in situ in
embedded clauses (see the 'a' fonns of (40}-(43) above) and echo-
questions (see §1.1.1.2.3. below). This sentence-initial position is then no
longer available for a topicalized element because the questioned element
occupies its structural position.","[62, 63]"
"1.1.1.2.2.2. 7 Movement of other elements of the clause together with the
questioned element
When the questioned element is moved, no other parts of the sentence can
be moved with it, except that a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase must
be moved as a whole when any part of it is questioned. Thus pre-
/postpositions cannot be stranded. A particularly striking example of this
is (66), where the postposition of a PP is questioned:
(66)   a      dfuJ        kOI]              nde   hi        d;}
       ART.   house + SG. DET. NON-HUM. SG. where direction PRON. 3sG. HUM.
       tufu
       sit + OUR.
       'In what direction to the house is he sitting?'",[64]
"
1.1.1.2.3.5 The elements of the sentence which can be subject to echo-
questioning
There are no restrictions on the elements of the sentence which can be
echo-questioned; this is hardly surprising, considering that the structure of
echo-questions repeats the original question verbatim.",[67]

1.2.1.1.1 Copular sentences with nominal complement
1.2.1.1.1.1 The be-copulas
There exist two overt be-copulas: la (positive) and dJ (negative), and they
are obligatory in copular sentences. These copulas have no other inflec-
tional forms.","[95, 96]"
"
1.1.1.2.2.1.6 Questioning more than one thing in a sentence
According to my informants, double questions within one clause are hy-
pothetically possible, but never used. In examples which they gave under
protest, of which two are given in (61}-{62), the question words remain in
situ.
(61)   ala       la    drraa       (a)se
       who (Qu.) EMPH. eat + PROG. what (Qu.)
       'Who is eating what?'(62)   nde         da              jako         sefu
       where (Qu.) PRON. 3sG. HUM. walk: + OUR. when (Qu.)
       'Where is he going (and) when?'",[62]
"
1.1.1.2.2.2.5 Intonation nucleus
In all wh-question structures discussed here the questioned element is
usually the intonation nucleus, i.e. it is the highest pitch in the sentence -
either by default, when sentence-initial, or by contrastive intonation when
in situ.",[64]
"1.1.1.2.2.1 Elements of the sentence that can be questioned
Interrogative main clauses in Koromfe normally have the wh-word or
phrase in initial position, and no overt marking of the position which it
would occupy in the corresponding indicative sentence. The wh-word or
phrase is optionally followed by the emphatic particle lao I have found no
case where the presence or absence of la is obligatory. The negative em-
phatic particle d:J cannot be used in this way.
    Interrogative main clauses with the wh-element in situ are rare except
in echo-questions (see §1.1.1.2.3. below).",[52]
"    Typical paraphrases for questioning elements of coordinate structures
like (57) are given in (58)-{60). Sentence (58) questions the first of the
conjoined NPs in (57), and (59)-{60) question the second.
(57)     ba                w5faa        b5nE       h1i la w5nE       hIT
         PRON. 3PL. HUM.   have + PROO. goat + PL. two and hen + PL. two
         'They have 2 goats and 2 hens.'",[61]
"1.1.2.2.4 Indirect questions
Indirect questions are introduced either by the conjunction ke or by a cae-
sura-inducing exclamatory particle such as handa. This is the same device
that is used in one common type of echo-question (cf. § 1.1.1.2.3 above).
    Otherwise indirect questions are syntactically identical to direct ques-
tions, although my impression is that the optional emphatic particle fa is
used more frequently than in direct questions. In example (102), handa
can be replaced with ke without altering the meaning of the sentence.
(102)    mg           zig (I) dl              handa ala       la
         PRON. Iso.   ask     PRON. 3so. HUM. truly who (Qu.) EMPH.

         PRON. 3so. HUM     meet + PAST ART. road    at (POSTPOS.)
         'I asked him whom he met on the way.'",[77]
"
1.1.1.2.2.1.4 Elements ofprepositional phrases
A prepositional phrase may involve a preposition, as in (52), or a post-
position, as in (53). The PP containing the question word occupies the first
position within the sentence and all elements of a prepositional phrase are
questioned in situ within the PP itself (including the preposition!
postposition itself - cf. (55) below). Thus in examples (52)-(54), the
question words ase, ala and ndeefJgo occupy their normal position within
their respective pre-/postpositional phrase.
(52)   la           (a)se      d~d~            dogome     a    nEmm5
       with (PREP.) what (Qu.) PRON. 3SG. HUM. cut + PAST ART. meat
       kOI)
       DET. NON-HUM. SG.",[60]
"       'Why didn't he give the knife to his younger brother?' (Lit.: 'What resulted in
       (the fact that) he didn't give the knife to his younger brother/sister?')A verb phrase cannot be questioned directly in Koromfe. The workaround
construction that is used is similar to that of English: the verb 'do' is used
with a questioned NP object, as shown in (39).

"1.2.1.1.6 Different types of copula
The only distinction between the types of copula described above is that
we and its negative counterpart 1)go must be used with a local adverbial
complement. Otherwise, la and its negative counterpart dJ are used for all
copula functions, including defining, identity and role (i.e. § 1.2.1.1.6.1-3).
    In addition, there is a verb km:tam 'become', exemplified in (183)-
(184), and a vast variety of adjectival verbs with the meaning 'be X' and
derived verbs meaning 'belbecome X', which are dealt with in the relevant
parts of §2.1.3 below.

1.2.1.2 Verbal sentences
1.2.1.2.1 Verbs without subjects or with dummy subjects
Normally, every verb must have an overt subject. But in the short utter-
ances of the type NP-la (185), PP-d.J (186) or ADVERBIAL-la (the last 2
words of (187» the emphatic particle la might be considered to be the
copula. In this case, we would have to say that these sentences have no
subject NP (at least for the second case). However, despite their full-
sentence glosses, I do not consider these phrases to be full sentences of
Koromfe, but either elliptical sentences or non-sentential exclamatory
utterances akin to short answers to question-word questions. 25

1.1.1.2.1.3 Alternative
The only alternative yes-no questions that exist in Koromfe involve repe-
tition of the finite verb with a negative pronominal subject (and optionally
some pronominal objects). There exists no corresponding structure with a

"1.1.1.2.2.2.4 Clefting
The question structures involving the emphatic particle la might perhaps
be regarded as a kind of clefted structure if the la is interpreted as being
the copula. However, I do not consider them to be clefted. There is nothing
which corresponds to a relative pronoun or particle in this structure. Thus
parallel to (33), repeated here, we also have (65) with la intervening be-
tween the question-word and the rest of the sentence.",[63]
"   Example (378) shows the relative order 'topic NP             wh-word' in
questions, and also the topicalization of a subject NP with a pronoun copy.",[175]

There exist both a singular and a plural form corresponding to English
who and one (singular only) corresponding to what, all of which are listed
in (612). No non-human plural or diminutive form exists. The word ase is
phonologically disharmonic, indicating that it the initial a may be the arti-
cle. Since § 1.1.1.2.2.1.1 contains many examples, no further ones will be
given here.",[296]
