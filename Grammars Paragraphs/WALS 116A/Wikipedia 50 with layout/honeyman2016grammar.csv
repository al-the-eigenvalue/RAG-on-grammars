   To the extent that Momu has an “alternative question” type construction
(König and Siemund, 2007), it is expressed by the juxtaposition of polar
question clauses, as in the example below. The answer to such a construction
is necessarily not “yes” or “no”, but encourages the hearer to select one of the
alternatives proposed by the speaker.","[378, 379]"

14.3       Disjunctive coordination
The coordinator for disjunction is o ‘or’ and is borrowed directly from tp o
‘or.’ It is a postpositive coordinator occurring after all coordinands, be they
nominal, phrasal or clausal. The disjunctive coordinator can be used inter-
rogatively or non-interrogatively, and the diﬀerence is prosodically marked.
As a coordinated disjunctive interrogative, the function diﬀers from a polar
interrogative. It is instead an ‘alternative question’ form (§10.3.2).21
    For instance, (14.51) gives examples of predicative uses of NPs that con-
tain disjunctive coordinands. In (a) the rising intonation on both coordin-
ators marks it as interrogative. In (b) the use is standard (declarative), and
the intonation on the coordinators is falling.
  21
     A disjunctive interrogative asks for a yes-or-no response while an alternative question
form asks the responder to select from the named set, or name an alternative.",[511]

10.3.2.1     Polar question marker =faOne form of polar interrogative in Momu is formed by adding the marker
=fa (§3.5.5.2) to a clause.(10.39) (a) M: Fasniye=fa? A: Mm, faskaney.

          that, go upriver? A: Yes.’                                 space-gameNote that the realis progressive form nowo ‘it is (here)’ is used in (10.39b)
to question the precise location of an entity. In that exchange, Monica (M)
knows that the questioned object is on the other side of a divide, she just
doesn’t know exactly where, hence the proximal form can be used. More
commonly, such a question would require the speaker to use an irrealis pro-
gressive form, like afta ‘you are (location unknown)’ shown below, which
doesn’t use a deictic to (roughly) locate it.",[378]
"10.3.1       Declarative
Declarative clauses are used to assert or report states of aﬀairs. These include
complaints, bragging, predicting and promising (König and Siemund, 2007).
       Declaratives in Momu are the default, unmarked sentence type. There
is no specific marking, however the emphatic markers -e and -a are pos-
sibly a component of certain sub-types of declarative speech-acts. Further
investigation is necessary.
       Declaratives generally take an (unmarked) rising-falling intonation con-
tour over a simple clause type. However, as with every generalisation, there
are exceptions. Complex clause types such as coordinated structures have
more complex intonation patterns. In §10.3.2.4 I briefly review declaratives
with parenthetical questions mixed in. There is also a marked post-posed
participant strategy where the predicate has a terminal contour, and the
post-posed element has a marked rising contour (§8.1.3).1610.3.2       Interrogative
Interrogative sentences are sentences typically intended as a request for in-
formation from an interlocutor. Interrogative sentences in Momu include
polar questions, where the veracity of an assertion is being sought, and con-
stituent questions where content relating to constituents are being sought.
A reply to a polar question might be yo ‘yes’ or momu ‘no’, or something
in between.17 A constituent question (§10.3.2.3) involves a question word
(§3.5.3). A reply to such a question might minimally be the sought-after
constituent, or may mirror portions of the question as well. The example
below includes both a constituent and polar question. The first sentence
  16
      There are definitely extra-clausal post-posed participants (topical afterthought), but
the pattern described is in addition to this. Further investigation is necessary to confirm
it however.
   17
      Between the absolute poles of true and false, replies can be epistemic in nature (e.g.,
aisena ‘who knows? / maybe’, or a form of the epistemic stance marker (§12.1.2.1)), or
even a question in return.",[377]

Indeterminate future events controlled by inanimate forces (typically met-
eorological forces) are marked by -meta.(12.14) (a) Fetebwe kwa tity           bu-meta.

             ground rain come.down\3sgS-epi.fut
             ‘Rain might fall.’       The heterosemous free form meta(i) functions as a verb.9 Unlike the
bound inflection, this form takes inflectional categories, and it can be used
in serialisation, as in (12.15a).10 In this preverbal position it is often proclitic.
It can also stand alone as an inflected verb, as in (b) and (c).(12.15) (a) Te metai           pi-mu=a?
             1sg what.do[1sgS] one.goes[1|3sgS]-vol.fut=q
           ‘How will I go?’                             picture-task-part1   9
     Diachronically, the form most likely comes from the fusion of the prefixing form of the
hypothetical future marker -me (§12.1.1.3) in combination with the verb ta(i) ‘do.’ In fact,
this may be a valid synchronic treatment of the free verb form. In Baron’s unpublished
grammar notes he records -meta as being optionally inflected for subjects (Baron, 1984).
  10
     A nominalised form of the verb is also used as an interrogative pronoun (§3.5.3)
                                           396

As a serial verb, it appears non-finally, which means that the combination
of a verb plus the inflection cannot be mistaken for serial verbs.12.1.1.3     -me Hypothetical futureThe modal inflection -me indicates a possible or potential future action in the
interrogative mood. I have tentatively labelled it the ‘hypothetical future.’
The analysis here is correspondingly tentative, in the absence of enough
examples to provide a proper analysis.
    The form is quite rare. I found it either in the context of meteorolo-
gical events, or in questions of ability or potential. The hypothetical future
occurs only in interrogative mood and is the natural interrogative partner
to declarative uses of the epistemic future -meta (§12.1.1.2). Specifically, it
occurs in polar interrogative combinations. Most commonly this is the polar
question marker =fa (§10.3.2.1), but it also occurs in a few constructions
with subordinating uses of the restrictive marker =s (which in such contexts
often creates conditional clauses (§16.6.2)). For instance, it can occur with
the disjunctive o to create a kind of unfulfilled tag question ‘might it be or...
(not)’ (§10.3.2.2), or with the modal predicate =s on ‘might it seem that...’
(§16.1).11
    When in a question–answer pair the corresponding positive answer is
marked with the epistemic future -meta.
(12.16)                                                                             2008.217      Q:     Ay fi-f-me=fa?

             yes swim[1|3sgS]-epi.fut
             ‘Yes, I can swim.’
   11
      The hypothetical future can also be used in sentential complements to a small range
of complement-taking predicates that accept irrealis or interrogative complements (§16.1).","[423, 424, 425]"
"4.8.2         Oblique =m
Any or all object and oblique arguments can be marked by the oblique.
The marking indicates that the NP functions as a non-subject argument.
Oblique-marking may be required, optional, or impossible according to the
situation. A combination of word order, oblique-marking and predicate type
is used to define both objects (§8.2.2) and obliques (§8.2.3). Adjuncts cannot
be marked oblique.28 The oblique can also mark sentential complements to
a variety of complement-taking predicates (§16).
       A secondary function of the oblique by way of its optionality is as a
marker of new information. Non-subject arguments in a clause that are
clearly active in the discourse are often expressed by zero anaphora. Refer-
ents whose role in the clause is understood from context may be expressed
by an NP, unmarked for the oblique, as a case of topical reactivation (Lam-
brecht, 1996). Referents new to the discourse or unrecoverable from context,
or those for whom the speaker deems to be of an unclear role must be marked
oblique.
       So, for instance, both the question word and the answer that fills the
same slot in a question-answer pair in (4.18) are necessarily marked with
the oblique. In the question and answer, oblique-marking is required. The
constituent question form is, by definition, a request for an unknown referent.
The response is a new referent (or role for that referent) to the hearer.
Admittedly, this could also be driven by dialogic parallelism that creates the
expectation that the response form should structurally mirror the question
(Evans, 2012).
(4.18)                                                             topological-relations         Q:    Kontena eru, boku=m        wu-ta?

               ‘Where is that container.’
  28
     Amongst the modal adverbs (§9.6) are two forms where a presumed oblique marker
is fused into the form of the adverb.",[168]

Polar (yes/no) questions are formed with the addition of a marker =fa at
the end of the clause (§10.3.2.1). Again, this is usually accompanied by a
rising sentence-final intonation.",[140]

requested is the identity of an animal in a picture. The second sentence lacks
an interrogative pronoun, and is marked with the polar question marker =fa.

identity of that animal as a dog.","[377, 378]"

10.3.2.2    Disjunctive interrogativeThe disjunctive coordinator o (cf. tp o ‘or’) is used in sentences with in-
terrogative intonation, in much the same fashion as occurs in Tok Pisin. In
(10.42a) it occurs after the clause, while far more commonly that clause is
first marked with the restrictive =s, as in (b).(10.42) (a) Ninya              o?

be coordinated to form “alternative questions”, but this time the disjunctive
is used as a coordinator (§14.3). The disjunctive can be used either mono-
syndetically (10.44a) or bi-syndetically (b), but for interrogative use, only
the post-positive form is used.(10.44) (a) Emsi-ta-u            o skab-ta.

10.3.2.3   Constituent questionsConstituent questions are formed with a question word (§3.5.5.2) used “in-
situ”—that is, in the position in the clause that the answer to the question
would fill in a declarative form. The clause is then optionally marked with
the question marker =a. There are two sets of question words, based on
their form, either starting with b (b-set) or m (m-set). The question words
are distributed unevenly across the two sets. A subset of the question words
can be used as modifiers to a nominal to form a selective sense (§3.5.3).
   The question word byeku ‘what’ (or beku/b(y)oku) fills the constituent
position, with the appropriate relational case, to question the identity of
a referent. In (a) the subject is initial and unmarked. In (b), the theme-
oblique is marked with the oblique case. In (c) the instrument-oblique is
marked with the comitative case. (d) demonstrates a predicative use in an
identificational clause (within a quotative).(10.45) (a) M: Boku poonu=a?         B: kap     poonu.

To question the identity of a human, or higher animate referent (i.e., dogs,
pigs and cassowaries), the form bu fills the appropriate position in the clause,
with the appropriate case marking. (10.47) demonstrates predicative uses in
identificational clauses.(10.47) (a) “Mo yime eru bu=a?”

tion with the final verb or verb cluster. The transitivity of the form matches
the verb that it modifies, either intransitive (10.48a) or transitive (b). A
nominalised form is sometimes used in a fashion similar to the forms above

the framework on conventional implicatures by Potts (2005), or theticals
(Heine, Kaltenböck and Kuteva, 2016). This is an under-represented feature
of sentence types in language descriptions, but at least a similar construction
appears present in the Trans-New Guinea language Oksapmin (Loughnane,
2009, p401).20 See also Kayardild parenthetical assertions (Evans, 1995).

question in the same fashion as described below.","[381, 382]"

       It is reasonably common for the speaker to question the reference of a
participant in the middle of a declarative sentence. Both forms of polar inter-
rogative are used parenthetically in Momu. In this use, a regular declarative
clause is interrupted by a questioning of the identity of a given reference.
The queried quantity is marked either with the polar interrogative =fa or
a combination of the restrictive =s and disjunctive o. These are delivered,
often without pause or change in regular declarative intonation. As such,
the explicit marking of elements makes it clear that the overall statement is
asserted, but specific sub-elements are still in question.21(10.49) (a) ¿Anu=efa? pwen-e.

In Kwomtari the form used for polar questions can appear finally or in second
position (Honsberger et al., 2008, p168). This appears to be a diﬀerent us
however to that given here for Momu, but similar to the way in which the
restrictive is used for subjunctive-like clauses. The Kwomtari form pe as
given is used for polar questions, hortatives, and more generally epistemic
modality.

    I have tried to represent this mixed sentence type in translation by placing a paren-
thesised question mark after the questionable element. Alternatively, a fully expanded
translation for (10.49a) might be “This one—is it this?—came.” This doesn’t represent
the degree of integration into the main clause, however.","[382, 383]"

"3.5.3     Question words
Question words are a functionally motivated class that bring together items
from diﬀerent parts of the grammar. The question words divide into two
sets which I label based on the common first segment for each set:(3.31)
                       b-set                                     m-set
         b(y)eku/b(y)oku       ‘what’          me(na)nu      ‘what (approximative)’
         bu                    ‘who’           mena          ‘where’
         bekofuf               ‘when’          menfuf        ‘when’
                                               meta          ‘how (manner) / why’
         ( bye                 ‘whatsit’ )     meyer         ‘how’All forms, excluding meta and meyer, are nominal. As such, they can be
inflected for case (§4.8.1) and most can also modify a nominal (§5.1.4). All
forms can function as predicates to a clause.
    The b-set of terms are seemingly built around bye “whatsit”,24 with some
mutation.25 The final segments ku and fuf on the forms for “what” and
“when” do not correspond to anything that I’m aware of. Bu “who” is
identical in form to the proprietive marker =bu. However, it is not clear
that there is a relationship between the two.
    The m-set are built around the common initial segments me. This is the
same as the hypothetical future modal marker me which is both suﬃxed
and also prefixed in some cases (§12.1.1.3). The form meta ‘how’ is a verb
and was quite likely a verbalised form (using -tai, §6.3.1) or a hypothetical
future prefixed form of tai ‘do’. Note that it is identical to the epistemic
  24
     The “whatsit” form is used to refer to an entity or entities that the speaker is having
diﬃculty recalling. Note that an identical form is used adverbially to express denial of
permission (§9.6.3)
  25
     Glides in the context of bilabial trill are subject to some inter-speaker variation. I
presume the b-set forms are built around the “whatsit” form bye, with the who form bu
being transformed by a suﬃx -u (either nominalisation or the genitive). The variation in
the form of “what” can be accounted for by the rounding eﬀects of the bilabial trill, such
that bye > (bw e) > bo.",[136]

irrealis progressive construction, the distinction across the progressive is ac-
tually three-way. By locating the participants in an event, the speaker (or
asserted knowledge holder) is indicating that in knowing where they are,
they have reason to hold that knowledge as real. In situations where this is
not the case, the speaker must use the irrealis form of the progressive.
       Making an inflectional deictic distinction on verbs is unusual but not
unheard of. More commonly aﬃxal deictic distinctions might be considered
cliticised adverbial form, for instance, a rich system of spatial distinctions
including proximity which in some way aﬃx to the verb is not uncommon
in North American languages. For example, in Kwakwala, amongst a large
inventory of suﬃxes which “reflect the natural environment in which the
language is spoken” there is a suﬃx -em̀ ‘nearby’ which indicates proximity
(Mithun, 2001, p149). However, unlike the distinction required in the Momu
progressive, these are not obligatory categories. The Papuan language Berik
makes a two way distinction on verbs between an unmarked activity and
verbs marked with -tet to indicate that the activity occurred at some distance
(Westrum, 1988, p153).10
       Diachronically, the Momu distinction is possibly closer to a grammat-
icalisation of motion verbs (§C.4). In the North American language Nez
  10
       Berik also marks the spatial distinction of relative height (Westrum, 1988).","[284, 285]"

"11.1.1    Subjects and non-verbal predications
All non-verbal predications take a subject in Momu. Some predicates place
predictable restrictions on the form or semantics of the subject. Some select
for human (animate wholes), and some for non-human subjects. Amongst
the many forms of possessive predicates (§11.4, §11.5) there is a specific
possessive construction where the subject includes a possessive modifier
(§11.4.2). Abstract predications like temporal adverbial clauses probably
only allow a demonstrative pronoun as their subject (§11.8).
   Complex subject NPs are possible, but the full extent of available forms
has not been investigated at this stage. The status of embedded phrases, for
instance, is unclear at the moment, but deverbal clauses can occur as the
subject of an attributive:
(11.1) Fyi    tity      fwas-u emsu.
       water ahead bathe-nzr good
      ‘Bathing first is good.’                                           2008.195
It is unclear if complex subject NPs can occur with any other non-verbal
predicates. See also the adverbial uses of the deverbal clause (§16.5.1, §15.7).
   Zero-anaphora is extremely common in Momu, and perhaps more so in
non-verbal predications. Because of this, the majority of the natural ex-                                      360
amples in my corpus have elided subjects. For instance, in (11.2), the subject
of the first question is the subject of the second question, expressed via zero-
anaphora. ‘Esyufa?’ would equally be a valid utterance for a completely
new referent in the discourse if accompanied by an appropriate gesture.","[388, 389]"

As these are the only examples of such TAM marking, and because there
are non-grammaticalised readings of the inanimate existential, further work
is necessary to clarify if these are actual examples of variation in the stance
predicate.12.1.2.2      =m onfa Modal negative predicateThe modal negative is a fixed form which takes no inflection.18 Variation
in the form of the sentential complement to the modal negative contributes
to the modal value. The complement to onfa may be a non-verbal predic-
ate, in which case the predicate type determines the nature of the negation
(§11.9).19 The complement may also be a verbal predicate, in which case it
can be inflected for the imperfective, perfective, realis progressive, or voli-
tional future (§12.1.2.3).
       A plain unmarked (perfective) verbal stem with onfa conveys a meaning
roughly equivalent to a negation of the stance predicate (§12.1.2.1).20 That
is, the speaker uses the construction to indicate their stance on the matter as
being opposite (or diﬀerent) to the sentential predicate. Thus, the diﬀerence
between the form in (12.37) and a negative particle equivalent (fienu momu
‘It is not a lie’) is that the particle version is a statement of fact: it is not a
lie. The speaker knows or believes nothing of alternative possibilities. The
utterance in (12.37) is a response to disbelief.21(12.37) Mony=e wob            na-pwen                        eru.

  18
     The shape of onfa does not obviously indicate a verbal past but the marking of the
complement with the oblique =m does. Onfa may be related to the verb on ‘see’ with
the polar question marker =fa, but there is no compelling evidence for this.
  19
     In fact, for non-verbal predicates, onfa is the main form of negation.
  20
     In §12.1.2.1, I tentatively conclude that the stance predicate has a negated form
wu=momu ‘it is not the case that....’ The subtle meaning diﬀerence between this con-
struction and use of onfa is certainly in need of further investigation, especially because
of the complementary stance qualities of onfa.

taking predicate while others strictly limit complements to before the pre-
dicate (§13).
   Sentence types are broadly diﬀerentiated by intonation, but questions are
also usually indicated by a final enclitic (§10.3.2). Imperatives have special

is very common across the world’s languages (König and Siemund, 2007).","[56, 57]"

also mentioned above the influence of the “etic grid” approach of stimuli kits
developed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. These became
an invaluable source of exploration while on fieldwork.
       While back at the ANU, a weekly “grammar group” became a platform
for a group of junior and senior grammar writers to discuss the grammar
of a broad range of languages and a broad range of topics. This group was
particularly formative for me, both in the exposure to other ways of looking
at the same problems that had developed in localised traditions of gram-
mar writing,25 and in presenting arguments about grammatical structures
in Momu and in other grammars and typological papers in an environment
where they could be dissected by many interested minds. It was a fascinating
insight into typological variation, thanks to the many languages represented.
It was also an excellent avenue for discussion of just what a “grammar of a
language” could or should be.
       When it comes to situating Momu in the linguistic world, I have tried my
best to describe the language in its own terms. In particular, I have tried to
strike a balance between the use of abstract representations of structure, and
long form prose as two tools that aid in modelling structure and expounding
meaning. My approach to grammar writing is, I think, unconsciously influ-
enced by R. M. W. Dixon, who in turn had an influence on the generation
of grammar writing linguists in Australia by whom I was taught. Dixon
himself has named his approach as “Basic Linguistic Theory”, however, I am
reluctant to use the term. I believe that theoretical frameworks are models
that more or less fit a problem at hand. I very much agree with Dryer (2006)
that I am engaging with descriptive theory, rather than explanatory theory.
It is enough for me to attempt to answer the question of “what languages
are like” without being caught up in why.
       There is very little literature or data available for languages putatively re-
lated to Momu, and so a diachronic consideration of Momu cannot incorpor-
ate a thorough application of the comparative method until some substantial
work has been done on the languages spoken around Momu. However, I tend
  25
     For instance, the Oceanic tradition of grammar writing is very much grounded in
or perhaps served by the reconstruction of Proto-Oceanic. But also, the terminology,
distinctions and assumptions around broadly evident features of Oceanic languages are
assumed by insiders but at times opaque to outsiders. I don’t mean to single out Oceanic
languages here—discussing other languages and language families with other grammar
writers in the grammar group made it clear that this was very broadly the case for other
language families as well.","[49, 50]"

5.4.4    Interrogative pronouns
In §5.1.4 we see that some question words (§3.5.3) can function as inter-
rogative determiners. The same question words can function as interrogat-
ive pronouns. Unlike other pronouns, these pronouns cannot be modified,
but do commonly require relational-case marking—either the oblique marker                                     172
=m or the directional marker =ti in the case of location based question
words—unless they are subjects.
   In (5.38), the question words (a) boku ‘what’, (b) bu ‘who’, and (c) mena
‘where’ all function straightforwardly as interrogative pronouns. Locatives
can be marked with the oblique or directional case.

several trips to Savamui. In late 2010 I conducted another field trip and was
joined by Fiona a month into the trip. By this stage, many of the people in
Mori village had moved westwards up onto Iwolo mountain. This location
is much closer to Savamui. Once again I continued to visit Savamui, but
mostly based myself with the families I had lived with down by the river.
Some troubles in the village meant that we had to move on from Mori, and
we took the opportunity to stay in Mumuru for two weeks at the end of the
trip.
    In late 2012 I returned to PNG for a short trip to tidy up remaining
questions and to return many of the materials that I had collected over the
years. I stayed almost the entire trip in Mori, but I did manage to visit
Savamui once.","[46, 47]"
"2.1.4.2    Mid-high vowel and glide diphthongsThe combinations of mid-high vowels (/e/ and /o/) with glides are a special
case. Although glides aﬀect the non-mid-high vowels only minimally, in the
neighbourhood of glides, mid-high vowels are realised as higher. In the most
extreme case—/je/ and /wo/—they surface as monophthongal long pure
high vowels (§2.1.4.3).
   The combinations /jo/, /oj/ and /we/ are high ([ji], [uj], [wi]) or near
high ([jI], [Uj], [wI]) vowel diphthongs. /ew/ is unattested.(2.13) /jo/: /Esjo/ [PĔsj ju] ‘dog’, /junje/ [jundi] ‘sun’

(2.14) /oj/: /moj/ [mŨj] ‘cassowary’, /ojmo/ [PUjmõ] ‘I will cut it’(2.15) /we/: /mwe/ [mbw wi] ‘cassowary’, /wenase/ [wIn˘ã se] ‘they swing’The choice between the phonemicisation /oj/ and /we/ can be a little diﬃcult
to determine. While they contrast word-initially, elsewhere they are non-
contrastive (and subject to variation). Take /mwe/ or /moj/ for “cassowary”.
Some speakers make a noticeable denasalisation of the initial nasal ([mbw wi]),
while others do not. Transcribing as /mwe/ with the glide next to the nasal
would be one way of indicating this denasalisation. Only a subset of the
consonants vary when followed by a glide, so, in this case, it is probably
safer to opt for the more generally preferred ordering of GV. VG ordering
only occurs word-finally in mono-morphemic words.
       The sequences /ej/ and /ow/ arise only in a limited set of lexemes. Firstly
they only occur in the verbs /kej/ ‘eat’, /sej/ ‘urinate’, /nej/ ‘shoot one’,
/mOàkej/ ‘lay out’, /nafOfkej/ ‘carry on shoulder’ and /nokej/ ‘fill up’. These
verbs then have corresponding rounded third person singular subject forms
/kow/, /sow/, /now/ and /nokow/. Speakers refer to this as TP nek hevi
‘heavy voice’. The starting point of the diphthong varies a little from speaker
to speaker, with surface realisations of [Ij ⇠ @j ⇠ 1j] attested with correspond-
ing back variants [Uw ⇠ @w ⇠ 0w].19
       For a subset of these forms in Eastern Momu, the possibility of the diph-
thong arising via a linker vowel remains an open question (§2.4.5). This is
not an uncommon question amongst papuan languages (Blevins and Pawley,
2010; Jendraschek, 2012), and is made all the more problematic by phon-
emicisation choices of glides or high vowels, as demonstrated for Iatmul and
Kalam by Foley (1986, pp51–52).
  19
    Baron (p.c.) gives several more forms in Western Momu (transcribed in the ortho-
graphy used here): /fej/ ‘breast(milk)’, /aeEànej/ ‘talk secretly’, /àoànej/ ‘break up’,
/Esfej/ ‘leg’, /fEsnej/ ‘one’, /nafkej/ ‘carry on shoulder’. Many of these (non-verbal)
forms I record as long high vowels (/je/ or /wo/) rather than /ej/ or /ow/. This may
be a side eﬀect of the general flattening of the vowel space (§2.6.2). Some forms have
other diﬀerences in Eastern Momu (/Esfej/ : /Eàsje/, /nafkej/ : /nafOfkej/). Almost all
forms are verbs, and this means that the underlying form is confirmed by glide-consonant
metathesis which results in root-final glides being moved from a coda position to the onset
of a suﬃx, and separated from the diphthong (§2.5.1.1). It may be this morphophonolo-
gical feature that has helped preserve this unusual diphthong in Eastern Momu in higher
frequency verbs.","[75, 76]"

form. These verbs are used either (3.32a, 3.33a) in serialisation to form ‘how’

3.5.4     Demonstratives
Momu is a language where few demonstratives perform a large number of
functions (Himmelmann, 1996). Demonstratives function pronominally, ad-
nominally and adverbially in Momu. The demonstratives are given below,
with the demonstrative manner adverbs also given for comparative purposes.
  26
     Meyer is constructed with the verb-forming suﬃx -er and nominalised with the nom-
inaliser -u. The transitive form meyer ‘how’ can also stand alone as a predicate, marked
with the volitional future in a fixed expression, meyemu ‘Oh well! (lit. somehow we will
do it).’

ives.

There are two basic demonstratives: anu ‘this/here’ and (3.36a) eru ‘that/there’.
These have shortened bound forms that combine with the oblique marker
=m (§3.5.4.1). The approximative forms signal approximations of reference:
anenu ‘this kind of’ and (b) ereru ‘that kind of’. These forms are clearly
related to the manner demonstrative adverbs (§9.3.2).(3.36) (a) Eru=m       momse-rai-mu.

When functioning adnominally, the basic demonstratives occur on the right-
most edge of a noun phrase (§5.1). The demonstratives also function as
relativisers (§15.1).
    Demonstratives can stand alone as an argument to a predication. They
may be functioning pronominally, as in (3.37), or a locative adverbial, as in

3.5.4.1    “Fused” demonstrativesE=m ‘there’ and a=m ‘here’ are simply reduced forms of the general demon-
stratives (eru ‘that/there’, anu ‘this/here’), with the oblique marker =m
together forming a single phonological word. It can be diﬃcult at times to
be certain which function (adnominal or adverbial) the demonstrative fills.
However, when doubly marked with a full and reduced form, I take it that
both meanings are expressed (e.g., ‘that, there’). Given the relative position
of each in the phrase, I take the reduced form to be functioning adverbially.(3.39) (a) Yime eru e=m              y-ai-tu-wo.

of possession is expressed by a single construction. The two-place predicate

The inanimate progressive is defective for first and second person subjects,
because of semantic incompatibility. A specialised use of the verb for caused
locations does allow animate subjects (§13.2.3.3). These additional local
subject cells are therefore greyed in (7.8). It is not clear that the same local
cells can be filled for the irrealis form in (7.9), however.8               1               2               3

shown in Table 2.19. I will no longer place these between angle brackets
(<>).
   The h will not be marked after this chapter, except where I need to
contrast a known minimal pair. The diphthong ai will occasionally merge
with a in situations where there is a predictable truncation of the glide
(§2.5.1.2).
   The distinctions between various combinations of glides and high vowels
may be collapsed to just i and u in the remaining chapters. This is because
this thesis incorporates data from earlier fieldwork before I could consistently
hear a diﬀerence in certain vowel qualities, but also because many speakers
that I worked with either do not, or only variably produce these distinctions
further compounding the problem. In examples where there is no source
identifier (i.e., the example is common, and drawn from knowledge) or where
the year in the source identifier is 2010 or later, the distinction is consistently
                                        51
made. Where the source identifier is earlier than 2010, the distinction is
inconsistently made. See §1.6 for more on the format of source identifiers.
   From this point onwards non-English words in the body of the text will be
italicised. Tok Pisin forms are preceded by tp. Unless I revert to bracketed
conventions for phonemes or phones, the reader can assume that they are
viewing data that is phonemic (although lacking in the distinctions I mention
above in subsequent chapters).
   In example sentences, punctuation is meaningful. The absence of a final
period (.), exclamation mark (!) or question mark implies that the example
is a sentence fragment within a larger context. This is especially the case if
there is a final comma (,). Likewise, the absence of a sentence-initial capit-
alised letter implies a fragment—for instance, one taken from an embedded
clause. I have of course tried to minimise the use of such examples, but
for reasons of space (the more naturalistic Momu data in my corpus rarely
respects the constraints of a printed page), or because I lack an example
sentence otherwise, I have had to do this. At other times, an ellipsis (. . . )
indicates some redacted material. Nevertheless, in the interests of full dis-
closure, I have spelled out these conventions so that the reader is aware of
any changes I have made to source materials. In some cases, the reader
may wish to locate the original (§1.5) if they wish to confirm or refute my
findings.","[79, 80]"

indicate that one disagrees with with someone else’s assertion, or to invert
the assertion of a prior utterance, as in (b). If the polarity of the clause
is already negative, though, the negative does not invert the assertion of a
prior clause, but rather reiterates it, as in (c).(12.44) (a) M: An=ti        Buafo=ti=fa?       A: Momu.

Momu also functions as a two-place predicate for “not having” (§11.10).
   In notes by Baron (1984, p25) on Western Momu, the verb is nominalised
(or linked according to his glossing). This appears to indicate that origin-
ally, or independently for Western Momu, negation was or is treated as a
complement-taking predicate with a deverbal complement.
(12.47) excerpted from Baron (1984, p25) with glossing preserved(12.48) Te pin-u       momu.
         I   go-link.V verb.neg
      ‘I did not go’12.2.2    onfa Modal negative
As a complement-taking predicate (§16) onfa takes a sentence-like comple-
ment with a broader range of inflectional possibilities than the negative
particle momu (§12.2.1). Sentential complements to the predicate are usually
marked by the oblique, functioning as a complementiser.
   Onfa is used with non-verbal predicates (§11.9).         Depending on the
class of predicate of the sentential complement, combined they can express
non-equivalence (§11.9.1), negative attribution (§11.9.2) or negative location
(§11.9.3). Negative possession is expressed by the negative particle momu
functioning as a two place predicate (§11.10).
   Momu lacks a means of negating specific entities within a clause such as
adverbs, quantifiers, or constituents (Payne, 1985). Nor are there lexical neg-
atives to achieve this. Instead, this is usually achieved over multiple clauses,
with the relevant entity expressed as a predicate, and it is the predicate that
is negated.
   So, for instance, a single clause translation of (roughly, as this is not
possible in English either) “I will tell a non-big story” or similar, is not
possible in Momu. Instead, such information must be spread over multiple
clauses, as in (12.49).

12.2.3        Other sites of negation
Negatives are rarely expressed lexically in Momu. There are a handful of
complement-taking predicate that incorporate negation into their semantics
(§16.1.10). For instance, efiyeni ‘not want’ (§16.1.4.2), kwobo ‘not know /
be ignorant of’ (§16.1.7), and titwer ‘forget’ (§16.1.7) all lexicalise negations
of positive counterparts (and bear no resemblance to them) .
   The prohibitive inflection (§12.1.1.5) is used to indicate disallowed ac-
tions.
   Three modal adverbs code negation. Biom ‘inability’ (§9.6.3) and bie
‘non-permission’ (§9.6.4) code negated modal values. A negated reciprocal
clause can be coded by a specially marked form of akfu ‘reciprocation’.
The directional and restrictive combine to form akfu=ti=s ‘unreciprocated’
(§10.2.2.3).","[441, 442, 443, 444]"

tatively argues that the oe at the end of the verb forms is not part of the
person/number inflection on the these verbs.                         ‘go’                           ‘see’

taken from field notes and not a published source, so I am unclear about
transcription practices. There is no corresponding audio either to check on
transcriptions or translations. In particular it appears that TAM and inter-
rogative mood were not controlled for in elicitation. Forms with a question
mark may be interrogative. As such these data serve only to supplement the
Baron data. Note that Baron’s data records syncretism of first singular and
plural subjects, but that this is not apparent in Laycock’s notes.","[661, 662, 663]"

2.3     Phonotactics
In this section, I examine the distribution of phonemic segments (§2.3). The
primary question of this section is what sequences are allowed and not al-
lowed relative to morpheme boundaries and relative to each other (Blevins,
1995). At no point in this section do I appeal to syllable boundaries in
discussing distribution (Steriade, 1999), as I consider the process of syllabi-
fication to be fed by the knowledge of phonotactics.
   Sequences of phonemes are grouped as combinations of vowels, conson-
ants (exclusive of glides), and glides. In §2.3.1, I examine the distribution
of vowels relative to morpheme boundaries, relative to glides and relative to
each other. In §2.3.2, I consider the distribution of consonants (inclusive of
glides) relative to morpheme boundaries, and importantly for Momu, clusters
of consonants arising from suﬃxing morphology. In discussing sequences of
                                      52
segments, I use the following conventions: C refers to a member of the set
of all consonants excluding glides, G is a member of the set of glides and V
is a member of the set of all vowels. K is the union of C and G. Parentheses
indicate that a segment is optional.
    I give examples of mono-morphemic forms and then details of the exten-
ded distribution of segments that arise due to morphology. Throughout this
section, some examples will be marked with a small lozenge character (⌃).
This is an indicator that, to the best of my knowledge, the demonstrated
sequence only arises in polymorphemic forms.22
    Words in Momu begin with a (C)(G)V. In mono-morphemic forms, words
end with V, C, G, or CG, and medially C((C)G) clusters are possible between
vowels. Taking into account possible suﬃxing morphology, this expands to
include CC(G) finally on verbs and GC on nominals, and CCK medially on
verbs. Medial GC sequences are rare but possible in compounds.
    This section gives no phonetic detail, as I am concerned only with se-
quences of phonemes. Phonetic detail for sequences demonstrated here is
given in the section after this one, when I discuss their syllabification (§2.4).","[80, 81]"

      ‘Okay, her husband knows.’A third source of other non-verbal predications is subordinate clauses in-
cluding adverbial clauses and relative clauses. We saw above that purposive

  10
      Predicative adverbial clauses are rare. The example in (11.38c) is not ideal because
it is disrupted by a parenthetical question.
   11
      The examples in (11.38) are all identificational. Stassen (1997) argues that these are
not predicative, or at least that they are not predicative in the sense applied to other
predicates in this chapter.",[404]
"11.4.1       Genitive predicates
Genitive predicates are either genitive NPs or genitive pronouns. The subject
of the construction is the possessed entity.
       (11.20) gives some basic examples of genitive predicates. The number of
the possessor is encoded in the form of the genitive marker. In (11.20a) it is
singular, and in (11.20b) and (11.20c)8 it is plural.(11.20) (a) Mm, anues           mufu           anu=u.

    In (11.20c) the subject is expressed as an afterthought. Hence, the pause indicated
by the comma.",[397]

The correspondence between kwo and re for “tree” is diﬃcult to argue for,
but I tentatively place them as cognates. K and b in Momu both apply
labialisation to following vowels, and in the case of kwo this labialisation
might have been the source of the w. To get from re to kwo would require
   6
     Baron (1983c, p7), working from an analysis of rounding of a final high vowel spreading
leftwards (§2.5.1.3) represents a deduced underlying form for many ow sequences in his
work. For instance the form anow ‘big’ is represented as anew throughout, and the
corresponding surface form is [anOw]. Baron used underlying forms for representing some
forms in the data in Baron (1983b). This in some cases, makes the correspondence with
Baibai cognates clearer, but although likely, raises the question of whether Baron may
have mixed underlying analyses into the Baibai data as well.",[653]

consonants attract labialisation when followed by /w/. This results in greater
lip protrusion and rounding. In the case of /k/ it sometimes results in a
realisation further back in a uvular position. There is a great deal of variation
amongst speakers. This is a stronger feature for older, more conservative
speakers, and also speakers of western Momu. As such, I am aware that it
happens, but do not have a great deal of data on it.10                                             Examples

that obligatory labialisation may accompany the bilabial trill. Phonologic-
ally, this raises the question of whether placing a perceived /w/ after the
bilabial trill may be redundant. In forms like /àasO/ [àw asO] ‘child’ the labi-
alisation is there, but it seems stronger to me in forms like /àwamO/ [àwamÕ]
‘younger (same sex) sibling; sister’. For now, I will include /w/ when it is
perceptually stronger.
       Denasalisation triggered by glides is shown in Table 2.14. Denasalisation
varies from speaker to speaker. In the least eventful form, a glide between
  10
     Labialisation behaves very similarly in Imonda and Kwomtari (Honsberger et al., 2008;
Seiler, 1985). Velar and labial consonants followed by /u/ are labialised, and the vowel
sometimes loses syllabicity.",[68]

      ‘Go put the little stone there.’                   space-game   A -mu marked clause is future-oriented with respect to a certain tem-
poral origo, which is understood to be the time of utterance by default,
though other readings are possible in context. There are no grammaticalised
means in Momu for explicitly indicating the time of the predicated event or
state relative to the moment of speech. Instead, that time is constructed,
understood or inferred by the speaker from the context of the utterance. As
such, in the right circumstances, the matrix-level clause marked with the
volitional future can be understood to be indicating a past desire (fulfilled
or otherwise).
   In the exchange (constructed in elicitation) below, two people discuss
shooting a captive pig. Speaker A establishes that someone has already
done this. In their response, speaker B uses Teb niymu ‘I wanted to shoot
it.’ In the context, that is understood as a non-future reference time.

           ‘Did/does he want to shoot it? I wanted to shoot it.’The volitional future is not generally used with non-human agents. Inferred
future events triggered by non-human causes are generally expressed via the
epistemic future -meta. The one exception to this is meteorological events.
These are sometimes marked as volitional acts, particularly in those cases
where the outcome is unfortunate for someone.
   (12.10) is drawn from a text where Antonia talks about how the river is
constantly changing its path (to the point of causing mischief for the users
                                     394
of the river). At times, Antonia tells this from the perspective of the river
itself. Sometimes she uses the volitional future -mu for the whims of the
personified river.7 At other times the epistemic future -meta is used. In the
example, Antonia reverts to -meta after first using -mu.

So far, all examples have been in the declarative mood (§10.3.1). The voli-
tional future can also occur in the interrogative mood, in both (a) polar and
(b) constituent questions:
(12.11) (a) Maky oto-ti-mu=fa?
             middle put.one-come.down[1sgS]-vol.fut=ynq

       Where sentential complements to complement-taking predicates permit a
limited amount of modal inflection, the volitional future is the most common
inflection allowed. Amongst predicates taking sentential complements, the
modal complement-taking predicates are of particular interest when com-
bined with the volitional future. The combination of the modal negative
and volitional future expresses inability (§12.1.2.2). The combination of the
stance predicate and volitional future expresses desire or necessity, while the
stance predicate provides the overall modal and temporal frame (§12.1.2.1).12.1.1.2      -meta Epistemic futureThe “epistemic future” marker -meta indicates possible events, outside the
control or intention of the agent, and outside the knowledge or control of the
speaker. This includes events where something accidental might happen as
in (12.12a), or where the outcome is out of the speaker’s hands (b).8
   7
     The river in this text is also marked as animate by the form of the existential verb.
The river watches the people washing in one location and then moves so that they have
to move again to collect fresh water and wash.
   8
     In this example, the speakers have just finished a task, and one asks the other if they
have performed the task correctly. (b) is the response.","[422, 423]"

ject cross-indexes (§6.2.2.1). Subjects are cross-indexed for singular, dual
and plural number. Objects distinguish singular and plural number. Com-
paring Momu with Baibai (§1.1.1, §D.1), dual distinctions appear to be a
recent innovation not present in Baibai.
    Distinctions in person between subject and object cross-indexes are un-
even as well. Subject cross-indexes distinguish first, second and third person
across all number values. Object cross-indexes distinguish local and third
person.
    I use “local person” as a shorthand for the combination of grammatical
first and second person in a single form.2
    A secondary system of object cross-indexation is available in the form of
    1
      Naturally there are cases where the conominal is not “optional”. Haspelmath (2013)
anticipates this in his paper. In Momu, conominal interrogative pronouns are a necessary
part of forming constituent questions (§10.3.2), and conominal comitative pronouns are a
necessary part of reflexive constructions (§10.2.3).
    2
      The distinction is problematic but well recognised in the literature, albeit with dif-
fering labels. For instance Silverstein (1976) breaks down the diﬀerence with a binary
feature +/- participant. Dahl (2000) diﬀerentiates egophoric and allophoric reference (or
later non-allophoric and allophoric (Dahl, 2008)). Haspelmath (2013) (building upon Dahl
(2000)) diﬀerentiates locuphoric reference from allophoric. I follow Aissen (1999b, inter
alia) in giving the combination of first and second persons the label “local person”.",[211]
"(12.1) (M.ADV) VERB (-M.INFL) (=M.PRED)Not considered here, but potentially overlapping with modality, is the pro-
gressive (§7.4). The progressive in Momu is a multi-morphemic complex of
categories. In addition to coding ongoing activity, the progressive codes a
distinction between realis and irrealis. For the realis progressive, relative
distance (proximal and distal) is also marked.3 This is the only position in
Momu grammar where such a realis/irrealis distinction is made. That is,
Momu is not a language like Amele (Roberts, 1990), or (closer to Momu)
Kwomtari (Honsberger et al., 2008), where there is a clear, morphologically
coded contrast between realis and irrealis (Foley and Van Valin Jr, 1984;
Roberts, 1990). In this regard, Momu is similar to the Papuan languages
Imonda (Seiler, 1985) or Mian (Fedden, 2011), where, if there is “irrealis”,
then it is extremely limited, and is possibly of little explanatory use.412.1.1       Modal inflections
Momu modal inflection distinguishes between what I term the volitional fu-
ture (-mu) (§12.1.1.1), epistemic future (-meta) (§12.1.1.2), hypothetical fu-
   1
     The “modal predicates” in this chapter (§12.1.2) are revisited in §16.1 and re-examined
in the context of other complement-taking predicates. The majority of the modal predic-
ates in this chapter code (inter-)subjective modality.
   2
     Verbal inflection includes the aspectual categories (§7), and argument cross-reference
(6.2), both of which occur closer to the verb stem than modal inflection.
   3
     An alternate analysis, as found in a number of languages of the Americas (cf Cristofaro,
2012, and references therein), is that a three-way deictic distinction is made: proximal,
distal and unknown or unlocatable. In this case we can put aside the progressive for
consideration here.
   4
     Fedden (2011) ultimately rejects “irrealis” as a useful category in Mian while Seiler
(1985) argues for a lone irrealis marker constrained to the same environments as in Momu
(questions, conditionals, some complement-taking predicates). It is clear in Imonda that
there is not a pervasive distinction, however.",[418]

       While initially I assumed that verbal number was reasonably common
in Momu, this confusion was driven by the fact that some of the verbs cod-
ing verbal number are used quite frequently—especially within serial verb
constructions (§13.3.4). However, initial counts were quite low. Presently
I have counted about 70 unproblematic verb pairs where I have confirmed
that a given form has a plural or singular counterpart, and there are many
others where the pattern remains unconfirmed. This question can only be
adequately answered with more thorough and broad lexicographic work. In
Momu such verbs make up about 30% of verbs recorded so far.30 This puts
Momu at the more extreme end of the typological space, though behind
Hunzib (at 40%) (Berg, 1995).
       For the remainder of this chapter I look at the realisation of verbal num-
ber in Momu. In §6.6.1 I look more closely at the meaning of verbal number.
In §6.6.2 I look at the variable realisation of verbal number in Momu. In
§6.6.3 I address some issues relating to the theoretical status of verbal num-
ber as found in the languages of the world. In §6.6.4 I look at the rarer
instances of event number in Momu, and in §6.6.5 I look at issues concerning
the hybrid patterning of object prefixation and verbal number for transitive
pairs.","[254, 255, 256]"

people of Mori village, Sandaun Province, PNG. Many Mori people helped
me—more than I can name—but I especially have to single out Bernard and
Monica. Bernard, your often poetic descriptions breathed life into complex
problems. Sometimes, banging my head against the wall, a quick aside from
you was the inspiration for a lengthy detour through a hidden grammatical
side-path that I didn’t realise was right in front of my eyes. Monica, your
levelheaded explanations kept me on task. Your stamina in plodding through
some of the more tedious aspects of gathering texts and paradigms is awe
inspiring. And your ability to bridge the gap as my Tok Pisin developed and
intuit what on earth I was talking about was astounding. I honestly don’t
think I would have got this far without your patient guidance.
    In Mori, thanks also to Antonia, Simon, and Peter Yefiye for your as-
sistance with stories and with elicitation. Thanks Flerwick, Kaspar, Julie,
Luke, Peter and Angela, and Agnela for your contributions to the stories
we collected. To Steven Arame, thanks for your assistance both in matters
linguistic and logistic. I hope in my own small ways I was able to repay some
of your kindness.
    In terms of staying alive in Mori, it was really thanks to the generosity of
some key people who Fiona and I will always be indebted to. In 2005, thanks
to Flerwick, Yasu and your lovely family—Osi, Slupi and liklik Luk —for
hosting Fiona and I, but thanks also to Monica and to Julie for helping out
with food. To Primus, thanks for hosting me in 2008. There’s nothing like
lengthy late night conversations about the meaning of life to hone one’s Tok
Pisin, let alone sort out one’s priorities! In 2010, thanks to Kaspar and Keti,
and your wonderful family (Mambe, Andrew, Rachel, Mina, Larry, Maiklin,
Irene, Karl, Glenda, Ann and Ian) for hosting Fiona and me. You were truly
generous with us, and we really enjoyed being part of your family. Thanks
again for looking after me in 2012 as well.
    In Savamui village, thanks to Ferdi and Yarin for your frequently hilari-
ous tales. I really enjoyed working with you both, but also just chatting.
You both have a wicked sense of humour! Thanks also for your hospitality.
Thanks also to Denis, and to little John. Thanks to Dianne and Andrew
Solmo for hosting Fiona and I during walks to Savamui in 2005.
    Thanks to the people of Mumuru village for hosting Fiona and I for those
two weeks in 2010, and to Antonia and Francis for putting us up. After a
rough patch in our fieldwork, we truly felt welcomed. I only wish that I had
planned to spend more time in your lovely village.
    Thanks to all those many people who contributed to the big singsing
at Mori, Savamui and Mumuru. Thanks also to the very many people who
shared their food with me, and helped in other ways. Sitting on so many
balconies and shooting the breeze with so many warm and welcoming people
was to me the best part of working in PNG. Lewa bilong mi i stap wantaim

Baron for paving the way, especially on the more diﬃcult aspects of Momu
phonology.
   Thanks to my supervisors Nick Evans and Alan Rumsey for your careful,
thoughtful and patient comments and support over these many years.
   Thanks to the linchpin of RSPAS, CHL, and whatever it is called as I
write this: Jo Bushby, admin, and all round superhero for all your support.
Seriously, nothing would ever get done around here without you!
   Thanks to my family for their support over the too many years, especially
to my mother, Ann Tout, for helping out with Neve in the final stages.
   Finally special thanks to my partner Fiona. This turned out to be quite
the journey, from those heady early days adventuring around PNG to where
we are now. Honestly I couldn’t have done it without you. Thanks for your
support, emotional and practical, your (not insignificant) patience and, well,
for everything!
AbstractThis thesis is a description of the grammar of Eastern Momu, a language
spoken in Papua New Guinea in the north-western province of Sandaun.
This is a region with a fair amount of diversity, with several isolates or small
language families, and few detailed descriptions. Momu, or Fas as it is more
commonly known in the literature, together with the virtually undocumented
Baibai language, forms one of these small language families.
   The thesis is structured such that after a general introduction to the
people, language, and region, I give chapters covering: phonology, phonot-
actics and morphophonemics (Ch. 2), word classes (Ch. 3), nominals (Ch.
4), noun phrases (Ch. 5), verbs (Ch. 6), aspect (ch. 7), grammatical re-
lations (Ch. 8), adverbs (Ch. 9), clauses (Ch. 10), non-verbal predicates
(Ch. 11), modality and negation (Ch. 12), serial verb constructions (Ch.
13), compounds and coordination (Ch. 14), subordination (Ch. 15) and
complementation (Ch. 16).
   At first glance, Momu has a relatively uncomplicated five vowel phon-
ology, or ten vowels if one includes length. Glides hold a special position
within the phonology, phonotactics and morphophonology, as I have ana-
lysed it. Glides interact heavily with adjacent segments including metathesis
with adjacent consonants in a predictable fashion. Additional phonetic long
high vowels arise from some glide-vowel combinations. Amongst the conson-
ants, there is a bilabial trill. This is an areal feature that is rare amongst
the world’s languages.
   A marked feature of the verbal system, but also areally, is a relatively high
count of verbs coding verbal number. Verbal number in Momu is conservat-
ively estimated to occupy 30% of the verbal lexicon, placing it at the upper
end of the typological space. The theme of verbal number runs throughout
the thesis as its relatively high frequency makes for contrastive behaviour in
certain domains.
   Momu has some classically ""Papuan"" features such as serial verb con-
structions and verb-final ordering (albeit not strictly so). This thesis aims
to position Momu within the growing body of work describing the incredible
features, number and variety of languages of Papua New Guinea, but also to
focus on a region within Papua New Guinea with perhaps a higher degree of
diversity and lower total count of documentation overall.

Chapter 1Introduction1.1    The Momu language and its speakers
The Bewani Ranges are in the north-western corner of Papua New Guinea, in
Sandaun Province. They stretch from the border with West Papua eastward
to the Torricelli Ranges. At the eastern end of the Bewani ranges, there are
two strings of villages—one each on the northern and southern slopes. Momu
is spoken in these villages. An intricate web of tributaries flowing from the
ranges has created vast deltas on either side. Some maps indicate that the
language spreads north to the coast, but this is not the case. The villages are
spread out over a large area, with as little as an hour’s walk, but sometimes
up to two day’s walk between them. With so much distance, intermarriage
or other direct contact between the eastern-most and western-most villages
is unheard of.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

             ‘M: (That) might be his food.’ (epistemic assertion)(12.29d) is an identificational clause (§11.2.1) with a topically elided subject
(the referent having been clearly established at this point). Identificational
clauses lack aspectual or modal distinctions, but embedded within the com-
plement to the irrealis progressive form of the stance predicate it can be un-
derstood to be a currently held state of aﬀairs which the speaker considers
likely to continue to hold. In making the utterance in this form, Monica
establishes her subjective opinion in this turn of the discourse. This triggers
a progression in the dialogue: they move on to a new topic immediately.14
       The stance predicate takes a limited range of aspectual and modal in-
flection. The meaning expressed by the stance predicate can be roughly
paraphrased as “(it is / was / might be) the case that ...”, which correspond
to forms of the predicate marked irrealis progressive (wuta), perfective (wu)
and volitional future (wumu) respectively.
       The predicate is fixed upon the third person singular subject form. The
complement to the stance predicate is marked with the oblique case. The
complement itself may be perfective (§7.2), volitional future (§12.1.1.1) or
take realis progressive (§7.4.2), if verbal. The complement can also contain a
non-verbal predicate (§11) as in the example above, which expresses universal

    The stance predicate does not signal the end of a topic. There are many more factors
at play here, but I do not discuss them further as this section is mainly about the epistemic
value of the stance predicate.","[431, 432]"

15.6         Restrictive clauses
Restrictive clauses operate to divide an established set of propositions, or
to contrast a proposition as exclusive of an existing set. Restrictive clauses
are the potential topic counterpart to the backgrounding, contrastive, or
resumptive (actual) topics of focus clauses (per Haiman, 1978).
    As a marker on noun phrases (§4.8.8), the restrictive functions similarly
to divide or contrast referents. In the example below, Monica and Antonia
are talking about an image with two speech bubbles. One is above a man,
and the other above a woman. Having established the owner of the first
speech bubble, Monica contrasts the owner of the second one as diﬀerent to
the first.
(15.44)                                                           picture-task-part1      M:      Mm anu mony yime anu=u.
              yes this talk man this=sg:gen
              ‘Yes, this speech bubble belongs to the man.’
      A:      Mony yime eru=u.
              talk   man that=sg:gen
              ‘The bubble belongs to the man.’
      M:      Mm, anu=es         mufo            anu=u.
              yes this=rstr wife:sg:poss this=sg:gen
              ‘Yes, and this (other one) is his wife’s.’                                       513
When applied to clauses, the restrictive operates in a similar fashion. A
potential proposition is put forward and coupled with a potential outcome
should the proposition hold. In texts, a counterpart to the hypothetical
and its outcome are often given. For instance, in (15.45a), Yarin talks of
a hypothetical man who is well behaved, and listens to his elders. This
man is helped. In subsequent clauses, Yarin explains what happens to a
(generically) ill behaved man should he find himself in the initiation ritual
described. In (15.45b), Monica describes the behaviour of a mother around
a hypothetical newborn, and contrasts this with a hypothetical toddler.(15.45) (a) Eru ere, yime kefe eru te=m

(Thompson, Longacre and Hwang, 2007). The above examples both involve
non-verbal predicates, as this appears to be the most common usage. Sub-
jects need not be identical between the conditional and main clause. Both
the volitional future and the epistemic future can be marked on the main
clause to indicate what would or could happen.
   (15.46) gives examples of various non-verbal predicates in the conditional
clause.(15.46) (a) Ay koy=bu=s,                yeb on-f-mu.

refers to the source of the information. The object to the transitive form
refers to the recipient of the information.
       In all cases here, if one considers the speech complement as filling an
argument position, then the utterance complement is oblique according to
the criteria laid out in §8. For reported speech, the argument status or even
embedded status of such a complement is often disputed (De Roeck, 1994;
Thompson, 2002).
       In order to be consistently interpreted as utterance predicates, the com-
plement to these verbs usually follows the verb. Unlike many other comple-
ment clause types in this chapter, there is no complementiser.2 The form
of the complement is sentence-like (§16.6), and shows no restriction on the
marking of categories on the complement. The utterance is often accompan-
ied by voice quality and intonation consistent with an independent clause.
All of these factors combined indicate that in Momu utterance complements
are the least syntactically integrated of all complement clauses, to the extent
that it is questionable whether they are subordinate at all.
       Other strategies exist for conveying reported speech. A reference to the
source via an NP, followed immediately by the complement, or even just
a shift in voice quality in the absence of an utterance CTP can indicate a
shift in footing such that the hearer understands that the speech of another
person is being conveyed.

    Only in elicitation was a complementiser in the form of the oblique marker =m accep-

12.1.2    Modal predicates
Modal predicates express a variety of modal qualities that operate over
the entire clause. All forms are more or less complement-taking predicates
(Noonan, 2007), some of which have fused or reduced. All show a degree of
                                      402
grammaticalisation (§16.3.2), either by a reduction in form or a reduction in
inflectional possibilities.
       The components of these constructions in Momu are a sentence-like com-
plement, a complementiser, and a complement-taking predicate (henceforth
the modal predicate). All three have variable forms across the construction
types discussed below.12.1.2.1       =m wu Stance predicateThe inanimate existential verb wu has grammaticalised as a form of epistemic
stance marking which I label (and gloss) the ‘stance predicate.’ The form
encodes the speaker’s subjective assessment of the state-of-aﬀairs described
by the complement, relative to a temporal oﬀset established by inflection on
the predicate.
       Stance is a broad and varied topic across the literature (see Engelbretson
(2007) for an overview of diﬀerent approaches), but here I am singling out
just one component of stance. Following Engelbretson (2007) I take stance
to be a subjective, observable, interactional, indexical and consequential
phenomenon. As such, many examples of the stance predicate occur in
dialogic, natural and unscripted interactions between speakers, especially in
tasks like the social cognition picture task (San Roque et al., 2012), where
the speakers in one phase of the task are jointly attending to constructing
a narrative based on a series of images. Amongst possible instantiations of
stance, here the stance predicate codes mainly epistemic stance. Stance can
also code emotional attitudes and judgements of a given proposition. Such
meanings are coded by other complement-taking predicates in Momu, and
are examined elsewhere (§16.1).
       In the simple exchange below, two speakers are working towards identi-
fying the unknown elements in an image.13 Monica signals her tentative
position with the stance predicate in (d).
(12.29) Monica and Antonia identify objects in a
      picture                                                     picture-task-part1:image-3         (a) M: Yeko anu, oton    n-o-wo
                true this put.one px-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
  13
    In the exchange in (12.29) Monica first signals that she is guessing at identifying
the object in (a), using a parenthetical question kwus o? (§10.3.2.4). Antonia responds
