4.2 Interrogative pronouns   In addition to the personal pronouns listed above, which are unique in l'saka in being a
non-bound word class that shows multiple distinctions for case, there is also a small set of
mainly non-human interrogative pronouns. Not all of these are single morphemes, with
'when' and 'where (location)' showing the instrumental suffix -ri in a lexicalised and
idiosyncratic usage. All the known interrogatives are listed in Table 24.
52       Chapter 4                                      Table 24: Interrogatives                        I'saka                                   lexical category
                        amo         who                          noun
                        kaung       what                         noun
                        kaung ri    when                         noun
                        suIu '      where (direction)            noun
                        ta ri       where (location)             noun
                        -(i)aka     why, how, do what            inflecting verb   Two of these interrogatives must appear with the instrumental marker -ri; see §5. I . I for
more discussion of this morpheme. Examples of the use of these different interrogatives are
given in the following sentences:
     (77)        Kelie     amo b-au        wei    bima ?
                 yesterday who QSG-come house 2SG.POSS
                 'Who came to your house yesterday?'
     (78)        Mama b-au        wei     dina      kaung-ri?
                 2SG   2sG-come house I SG.POSS when-INSTR
                 'When are you coming to my house?'
     (79)        B-ele ' suIu '?
                 2sG-go where
                 'Where are you going?'
     (80)        Wei    bima      ta-ri?
                 house 2SG.POSS where-INSTR
                 'Where is your house?'
     (8 1 )      Epu     aka ou ?
                 3PL.NOM why do.pL.p
                 'Why/How are they doing it (to them)?'
     (Note that the third person plural inflection is 0   -   see §5.2.2.)
     (82)        Bepu      a b-(i)aka b-ou-na ?
                 2SG.NOM pig 2SG-why 2SG-do.pL.OBJ- I SG.DAT
                 'Why did you shoot my pigs?'
   These interrogative pronominals functions in content questions, and the pronouns referring
to A , S a nd P, appear in a special structural position, which is described in §6. 1 .
Interrogatives of possession ('whose?') are formed in a normal possessive construction with
the interrogative amo:
     (83) a. A amo bIe?
             pig who that
             'Whose pig is that?'
              b. A dina .
                 pig I SG.POSS
                '(It's) my pig. '
                                                                      Pronominal forms          53   An alternative reply to this question i s t o simply use the possessive pronoun, or a noun i n a
possessive function, as a predicate: Dina 'Mine'.
   Questioning locations is a fraught issue in I'saka. The examples above have shown
questions based around the position of an inanimate item ('Where is your house?'), or the
direction of travel ('Where are you going?'). It is not so easy to ask where a person is. A
typical question/answer sequence is one in (84):
   (84) a. Mama amo bu ?
           2SG     who woman
           'Where are you from?'
         b. Nana J 'saka bu.
            1 SG Krisa woman
            'I 'm a Krisa woman.'
   I t is easy to see that the question is literally asking 'Whose woman are you?' This
question, and the answer, shows the personification that is normal in I'saka when referring to
villages: 'I am Krisa's woman ' . An alternative way of questioning someone's origins,
something like 'You are a woman of where?', is not grammaticaL
   (84)' c. * mama     tari  bu ?
              2sG      where woman
   A similar example of the unexpected use of a construction involving amo 'who' in a
questioning situation arises when questioning someone's clan name. In this case the literal
translation of the sentence is 'Your clan's name is who?', as can be seen in (85).
  (85)      EM> Bulakau bima         INp ta l ia ] ] amo?
                clan     2SG.POSS        skin 3PL who
            'What's your clan name?'
   More examples of the personification of villages can be seen in the choice of locational
verbs, described in §5.3 . 3 .
5           Morphology
   Compared to many languages of New Guinea, the level of complexity encountered in the
morphology of I'saka is not great. Nonetheless, the divisions made in I'saka are intriguing
and cross-linguistically unusual, especially in the area of verbal affixation. In this section we
shall examine first the notional syntactic categories that can be applied to I'saka, on
language-internal morpho syntactic grounds (already discussed in Chapter 3), and then discuss
the morphology that is associated with each of those word classes.","[69, 70, 71, 72]"
"
3.5. 4 Epistememes
   The various morphemes used to form questions also form a tacit classification of the
world, acording to which epistememe is appropriate to question which nominal. The different
epistememes, along with examples of their use, are presented in §4.2.
44   Chapter 3  The next chapter details the extensive pronominal category, in both free and bound
morphological forms. In addition to this, we shall discuss the functions that the different
morphological forms of free pronouns serve in syntax .
4             Pronominal forms
   I 'saka has a rich range of pronominal forms, both free and bound. There are seven
pronoun sets in I'saka, comprising four types of independent personal pronouns, and three
sets of bound pronouns. In this section the forms of the different pronouns will be discussed,
with notes on their different functions, which will be explicated in more detail in §5.2.","[61, 62, 63]"
"
6. 1.2 Interrogative clauses and the word order offocus
   The word order of interrogative clauses differs from that of declarative clauses. In an
interrogative clause an interrogative pronoun (illustrated here with amo 'who') will appear in
the preverbal focus position. This is true even if the referent of the question word is the
subject of the clause, and mirrors the ordering of constituents under focus in questions,
mentioned above.
   (249)    Tra              bie     amo b-ei?
            sago.delight.NM that     who QSG-do
            [ OBJ ]          [SUBJ] [VERB]
            'Who made that sago delight?'
    An A-P-V order is not possible when the subject is a question-word pronoun:
88      Chapter 6     (250)     *amo tra ble bei?
   This suggests that there is a structural position for pragmatically prominent core elements
of the clause, which is immediately preverbal, a phenomenon not uncommon in SOV
languages. Note that a questioned oblique still occurs in the normal postverbal position:
     (25 1 )   Sit  b-akale kaung-ri?
               sago 2SG-wrap what-INSTR
               'What will you wrap the sago with?'
   Combined with the topic position data seen in §6 . 1 . 1 , the adjunct nominal information
from §5 . 3 .2, and the knowledge we have about the position of oblique arguments in I'saka
(see §6. 1 ), we can conclude that the phrase structure is as seen in (252):
     (252)                         SI
                          ------

4.1 Personal pronouns
   The personal pronouns in I'saka distinguish first, second, third, and indeterminate (i.e.
question) person, and maximally three numbers. Additionally, gender and case are found as
separate categories, according to the following criteria:
    Number: Singular and Plural are distinguished on all pronouns, and Dual is a
            distinct number on first and second person pronouns;
    Gender:    Gender (masculine or non-masculine) is marked on third singular
               pronouns only; it is a category only for the singular pronouns, with no
               distinction between masculine and non-masculine in the plural;
    Case:      Amongst the singular pronouns, all but the question pronouns can be
               marked for nominative or accusative case, or appear in an unmarked
               form.
   There is good evidence that the number opposition must be modelled as two features,
singular versus non-singular, and plural versus non-plural, rather than having a single, three­
value feature. The reason that these groupings are used is that suppletive or prefixal object
marking on the verb refers to a grouping of (SG + D U ) versus PL; this suggests some
commonality between the singular and the dual, as opposed to the plural. Further, there are
some processes that refer to SG versus (DU + PL). Standard conventions apply so that [+SG]
automatically confers the value [-PL], and vice versa. By this classification dual is in a sense
an unmarked category; this surprising result is reflected in the treatment of all dual numbers
as showing the same consonant in subject prefixation (§5 .2 .2). On the other hand,
underspecification means that the dual numbers are the only ones that have to bear a marked
feature for both [SG] and [PL], albeit a negative value.
   The gender system shows a clear marking pattern with masculine as the marked category,
a category composed of animate male entities and items immediately associated with them,
versus a generic 'default' non-masculine gender that is not semantically definable except as                                              45
46     Chapter 4being non-masculine. In the pronouns, masculine is marked only on the singular forms, also
suggesting that masculine is more marked than non-masculine.
   The formal realisation of case marking is somewhat opaque, though the formal
relationship between the possessive forms and the accusative, and the appearance of a clearly
segmentable formative -pu in the nominative, point to the fundamental difference being
between the unmarked set and the accusative set; these are the only pronoun sets that do not
show a derivational (albeit simply historical) relationship, or some overlap in function. The
free pronouns for singular are shown in Table 20.","[63, 64]"
"
6. 1. 1 Declarative word order
   The basic order of elements in a declarative sentence is SOY, with Oblique participants
(including those that may be encoded on the verb by the dative suffix) appearing after the
verb (these include nominals bearing the following semantic roles: instrument, companion,
recipient, beneficiary, goal, and location, and also possessor of P). If more than one oblique
is present, then goal and location will follow other peripheral arguments. Temporals are
usually clause-initial.
   (23 5)   S 0    TIME    NPSUBJ    NPOBJ     V NPASSOC, BEN, REC, INSTR NPGOAL, LOC
   None of these elements are obligatory. Some examples of the practical consequences of
these rules governing word order are exemplified in (236}-(240) below.
            Postverbal oblique:
  (236)     Numupu         di- 0          ku      wei.

               'Yesterday I cooked this sago delight for/with my mum. '
               Instrument precedes locations:
     (240)     Depu               d-ele '-le '  yang-ri        I 'saka i '.
               1 SG.NOM           1 SG-gO-<IRR> leg-INsTR      Krisa village

               'I 'll walk to Krisa village.'
   Deviations from the word order presented here are rare, although preverbal constituents
are occasionally found either at the end of the clause for emphasis, or in the pragmatically
marked preverbal 'focus' position in which elements are pragmatically salient, and, with the
exception of nominals or pronouns that simply double a clause-external topic, do appear to be
necessarily focused. This is most commonly found if that constituent is the answer to a
content question. Furthermore, there is a pre-sentential topic position, which is filled with
any NP (subject, object, or an oblique) from the clause. The topic NP in the main clause can
optionally be doubled in the clause, in the preverbal focus position (unless the clause contains
another argument with the pragmatic function 'focus').
     (24 1 )   S'   �    NPTO P S(lNP)
    Note that an NP in the topic position retains its normal case-marking possibilities, as seen
in the following examples:
               SUBJ as topic:
     (242)     Dapu,      a       hIe dapu        n-ou.
               1 SG.NOM pig.M that 1 SG.NOM 1 SG-eat
               'Me, I want to eat (some of) that pork.'
     (243)     Dupu,    kelia       n-oru .
               1 PL.NOM yesterday 1 PL-come
               'We came yesterday.'
               OBI as topic:
  (244)        Kie,         amo m-a?
               3SG.M.ACC who QSG-hit
               'And him, who hit him?'
                                                                                   Syntax     87   (244)'   *kie, amo kie rna ?
   (244)' is ungrammatical because the question word amo already appears in the preverbal
focus position, and so it is impossible for the topic to be doubled there. The examples below
show that even an oblique, if it is doubled, appears in the preverbal focus position, not in the
expected postverbal oblique position. Note that an instrument, which is normally marked not
just by postverbal position but also by the case marker -ri, when topic ali sed requires that a
pronoun remain behind in the original position to carry the case marking.
            OBL location as topic:
   (245)    ['      bie, nesing i'       s-eie '-ie'.
            village that I DU village I Du-go-RED
            'That village, we two're going there. '
            OBL instrument a s topic:
   (246)    D6 bie tei d-akai omu-ri.
            axe this tree l SG-cut 3SG.NM-INSTR

            'That arrow, that I shoot pigs with it (her).'
   (247)'   *d6 bie tei dakai
   (247)"" *d6-ri bie tei dakai
    If the topic can appear repeated in the preverbal 'focus' position (because there is no other
specified focused element), then overt case marking there (as nominative or accusative)
licenses a pronoun in topic position to be unmarked for case:
   (248)    Mama, bi           k-eiei  ya ?
            2SG     2SG.ACC 3SG.M-see COMP

nasalised, if the syllable contains a nasal rhyme; it is impossible to have a syllable such as
*[ba], for instance, or *[wi], in I'saka. Nor is nasality ever found on the onset of a syllable
that has a purely oral rhyme: *[ni] or *[wu]. It is most appropriate to describe a syllable as
being specified as nasal or oral, this quality then being realised wherever possible (that is,
wherever voicing is present). We may represent the locus of the nasal contrast in I 'saka,
compared to some better-known languages, in the syllable-structure figures that follow.
English contrasts nasality only on consonants, and so only on onsets and codas: the nasality
of the onset has no effect on the choices available for nasality in the coda, and vice versa, as
seen in the independent specification for nasality in the onset and the coda in words like
numb, mad, dumb, and dab. In Japanese we can see contrastive nasalisation on the onset, or
on the rhyme as a whole. A language like French contrasts nasality on the onset, the nucleus
and the coda independently. In I'saka, nasality contrasts only at the syllable level.","[36, 37]"

for the contour tones, Rise and Fall, and with punctuation (an apostrophe) for the H igh tone.
The phonologically unmarked Low tone is also unmarked orthographically. The necessity of
distinguishing graphically between H igh and Rise tones is arguable, as contrasts between
these tones are rare. This is an important question that should be addressed if further work is
done. The application of the tone-marking scheme is limited in that only lexical roots have
been marked; bound affixes are not marked for tone. Tone density is approximately 3 5%:
that is, approximately two-thirds of the syllables of lexical roots are unmarked by diacritics
for tone.
3           Word classes
   A discussion of the morphology and morpho syntax of I'saka, or any other language, must
be based on the knowledge of the different categories that make up the units to which
morphological or syntactic restrictions apply. In this section we shall detail the different
lexical categories that must be recognised in a description of I'saka, and present the
morphological and syntactic arguments for their differentiation. There are three open word
classes, and a number of closed lexical classes. After an overview, the major word classes
are described in the following sections, followed by a brief overview of the minor word
classes, including references to where a more detailed description of their properties has been
provided. The major closed word class, pronouns, receives further treatment in a unified
account with the bound pronominals in Chapter 4.","[55, 56]"
"
3.2 Nouns
   Nouns are the most phonotactically varied of the word classes, with no restrictions on their
phonological shape (unlike verbs, see §3.3). Morphologically nouns are uninflected for
gender, number, or other categories, but are divided into two genders, masculine, M, and non­
masculine, NM . Gender is realised only through verbal morphology, in the choice of prefix,
40        Chapter 3suffix, or suppletive stem forms of verbs. The non-masculine gender is the unmarked form,
found with most animals, although some (e.g. pigs, the most culturally important and valued
animal) are masculine. Natural powers such as wind and rain are predominantly masculine,
with au 'moon' and (po)kisi 'night' being expected exceptions (this conforms to the cross­
linguistic data in Craig 1 986). Inanimate things such as plants and features of the landscape,
as well as household items, are almost exclusively non-masculine.
   I n addition to the pervasive, but morphologically unmarked in the NP, gender distinction
there is also a division between animate referents and inanimates. This is discussed in §5 .3.3,
where the choice of verb of location appears to be governed by pragmatic animacy factors.
There is evidence for some additional classing behaviour in I'saka, though it is no longer
productive, and shows no concord anywhere in the language. We can observe, however, a
more than chance series of phonological correspondences:
      •    nearly all birds show an initial [i] or [j] ;
      •    furry game animals show an initial [a];
      •    many hairless (and grammatical non-masculine) creatures, such as lizards and
           various water creatures, show an initial [u] or [w];
      •
           bandicoots tend to begin with [bi].
           (examples can be seen in the word lists in Chapter 1 0)
   While this has not been thoroughly checked, there does appear to be a strong tendency in
the Border languages Mnanki (and Man�m) for the names of birds to start with [i] or [j], and
for water creatures and game creatures to show an initial [a], and so on. This is also possibly
true in Fakmo (Bewani) as well, although in this language it is less striking (own fieldnotes,
2002-03).
   The question that might be raised is whether these represent cognate forms, or borrowed
forms, in the different languages. A superficial glance does not reveal many striking
cognates across the languages (barring this initial phone), and there are no morphological
similarities past this apparently classing phenomena. It seems that the idea of a 'shared
library' of biological terms in the Pual basin, proposed by Kocher Schmid ( 1 999) (see
§2 6 1 ), makes a lot of sense. The idea is that the culturally distinct groups in the Pual basin
  .   .
area, where the people of Krisa trace their origins even though they now live above that basin
on the Oenake plateau, have a common stock of labels for plants and animals, regardless of
their linguistic affiliation. These classing phenomena might be evidence for the antiquity of
that library, with the classes being retained in fossilised form even though the terms for the
individual species are often not cognate.","[57, 58]"

5.2.2 Subject inflection   All verbs (both finite and non-finite) in I'saka inflect by prefix for subject, as can be seen
by the following mainly regular paradigms of the verbs -iy 'sleep' and -oung 'eat'. The
columns for each verb are, left to right, singular, dual and plural, with first, second, and third
person rows running down each column. The final row is the 3SG.NM form, distinguished
from the 3SG.M only in the singular.
     (101)     d-iy    s-i     di-(2)          n-ou        s-oung      nz-
               b-iy    s-iy    yi-(2)          m-ou        s-oung      yz-ng
               k-iy    s-iy    (2)-iy          k-oung      s-oung      (2)-oung
               wi                              w-oung
    Based on this data, and other verbal paradigms, we can infer the underlying prefixes that
are applied to the verbs. The abstracted forms of the prefixes are shown in Table 25 below,
in the same arrangement as the forms in ( 1 0 1 ). We can see that the prefixes encode person,
number, and (for third person singular) gender. Singular, dual and plural number are
distinguished, and in the third person singular form a distinction between masculine and non­
masculine gender of subject is marked. Third person singular non-masculine forms are
commonly irregular and suppletive, and this is also the case (to a lesser degree) with third
person plural subjects. Prefixes for indeterminate subjects - that is, the agreement found on
verbs for questioned subjects, as in 'Who's coming?' - are identical to those used for second
persons, of whatever number is appropriate (unmarkedly singular).",[76]
"
4. 1.3 Accusative pronouns
    The accusative pronouns are restricted to representing only referents which serve as the
object of a bivalent verb. The following sentences show examples of the use of the
accusative in a bivalent clause, and of its ungrammaticality when used to mark an oblique
(similarly, the accusative set may not be used to represent subjects, though this is not
illustrated here).
     (69)     Pi      bi        k-ang.
              rain.M 2SG.ACC 3SG.M-wet
              'The rain wets you. '
     (70)    *die      d-cLU-ma
              SG.ACC l SG-come-2SG
              'I came to you.'
   The non-plural possessive pronouns clearly show a relationship (presumed to be historical)
to their corresponding dative suffix (see Table 28), and to the accusative pronouns. For
instance, we could analyse the l SG.POSS pronoun as being the accusative form of the pronoun
combined with the dative suffix:
      This, of course, begs the question of identify ing a subject; the referent of an involuntary state predicate,
      which is index ed on the verb with dative suffix es, may also appear in nominative case. See §5.2.4, §6.2 .
                                                                     Pronominal forms         49   (7 1 )   di       +    -na
            l SG.ACC      - l SG.DAT
            'my'
   It is interesting to note that there is, synchronically, an alternation in the use of unmarked
pronouns with or without the dative suffixes to mark possession. No such alternation with
the accusative pronouns is found. The accusative pronouns are used in some emphatic
contexts, such as the following example (which also shows the initial b- of bima appearing
as an [m] because of the nasal syllables both preceding and following it in the clause).
   (72)     Di m-a        ni,      di    moni' [m]ima.
            l SG 2SG-mt PROHIB l SG mother 2SG.POSS
            'Don't hit me, I 'm your mother. '
   Oddly, the first and second person accusative pronouns can be used for reference to
singular or non-singular referents: di can just as well mean 'us' as 'me'. The third person
pronouns are not so free in their scope, and the other pronouns are all 'better behaved' in
terms of what they may refer to.","[66, 67]"
"
6.2 Involuntary state subjects   In many languages of New Guinea an involuntary state is usually coded with the
experiencer as the apparent object of the construction and the stimulus as a nominal (in
contrast to reference-dominated languages like English in which the experiencer is coded as
the subject of the event). In I'saka the construction most closely resembles the New Guinea
norm, but the experiencer, while appearing in accusative case (if it is pronominal) is marked
on the verb with dative suffixes. This might reflect the fact that dative suffixes are more
productive than is strict object marking on the verb, but may also reflect the semantic role
associated with the experiencer.
   The predicate 'sick', for instance, is expressed with a morphological non-subject. We can
call it a non-subject only because the morphology coding of the argument is not consistent:
based on the form of the pronoun we would think that I SG was an object, but based on the
fact that it is indexed by a dative suffix on the verb we are led to believe that it is an oblique.
   (267)    Di           wii-na.
            I SG.ACC 3SG.NM.do- l SG.DAT
            'I 'm sick.'
   A literal glossing of this sentence is impossible. The accusative pronoun, in preverbal
position, signals that 'I ' should be glossed as 'me': '(it) sickens me'. Despite this, the dative
suffixes following the verb imply that we are dealing with a possessor or beneficiary: '(it)
sickens forlon me'. We are thus in a dilemma about the grammatical function associated
with the first person singular participant in (267): the dative suffixes imply that it is an
oblique, and the accusative case implies that it is object.
   Other involuntary state sentences do not use dative suffixing:
92      Chapter 6     (268)     Pi      di       k-ang.
               rain.M l SG.ACC 3SG.M-wet
               'The rain soaked me. '
    In addition to sentences of the sort seen in (267) and (268) the experiencer may also
appear in a nominative case (or, as is true of almost all constructions, the unmarked case,
which for example (269) would mean coding the l sG pronoun as nana). This is found only
if the argument in question appears before a causing event, and if an experiencer argument is
called for by the construction. A nominative experience is illustrated in the following
example, where the predicate ('sick') subcategorises for an experiencer, causing the sickness
to be manifested in that experiencer.
     (269)     Depu         wii-na.
               l SG.NOM 3SG.NM.do- 1 SG.DAT
               'I 'm sick.'
   Other dative experiencers are described in §5 .2.4. The general construction that has both
a nominal and an inflecting verb as part of the predicate is also found in the adjunct nominal
construction, which has been described in §5.3.2.","[109, 110]"

            'I eat sago with one egg. '
   Sentences with the instrumental marker attached to the head noun, but preceding a
modifier, are ungrammatical, as are sentences with the instrumental marker appearing on
both elements of the NP:
   (88)'    *kasue dei pai ri bima, *kasue dei pai ri bima ri
   (89)'    *su nou yung kung ri kaipa, *su nou yung kung ri kaipa ri
   The instrumental noun phrase is an oblique, as judged by the position of the NP after the
verb, and the lack of any agreement with it on the verb. Instrumentally inflected nouns can
also serve as modifiers for nouns inside the NP, as in the following phrase:
   (90)     pili    ape-ri
            garden white.man-INSTR
            'non-traditional garden '
   I n this example the head noun pili 'garden' is modified by ape 'white man', but the
modifier appears with the instrumental case. This is presumably to avoid any possible
confusion with a possessive construction ('garden of a white man'), which would refer to a
specific, referential garden and not to a generic category, or perhaps to show the fact that the
gardens in question are a feature associated with the advent of white people in New Guinea
and the introduction of new food crops, but are nonetheless the property of the indigenous
people. Note that it is possible for a noun like ape to modify a traditional noun, such as ape
pdi 'cartridges', without the instrumental.","[72, 73]"
"
5. 7. 1 Completive
   The completive (COMP) particle ya indicates that the event denoted by the predicate of the
clause has been completed; it is usually found with active, dynamic predicates. Two
examples, showing both an active verbal predicate and a non-active adjectival predicate, can
be seen in the following two sentences.
   (2 1 0)    Sit    bima        n-ou-ma     ya .
              sago 2sG.POSS l SG-eat-2SG.DAT COMP
              'I ate your sago.'
   (2 1 1 )   Nit      dina       nuo ya .
              daughter l SG.POSS big COMP
              'My daughter's all grown up. '
    The following example, which has a beneficiary following the verb in the normal position
for nominals with such semantic roles, shows that this particle is not attached to the verb, but
is rather a piece of clause-final morphology.
   (2 1 2)    Tra             d-ei-ka               tani' ya.
              sago.delighLNM l sG-do- 3SG.M.DAT father COMP
              'I made the sago delight for my father. '
   Possible counters to this claim are found when the dative suffix i s used to mark the object
of the experiential construction (§3.4, §5 .2.4), and is not coreferent with the subject of the
clause. An example of a coreferential clause with no dative marking is shown in:
   (2 1 3)    Nana ta ' d-aka            ya.
              l SG     skin l SG-scratch COMP
              'I scratched myself. '
   (2 1 4)    *nana ta ' dakayana, *nana ta ' dakanaya
  When the two arguments are not coreferent, the dative suffix appears outside the
completive marker:
   (2 1 5)    Ta ' b-aka-ya-ung!                (phonetically [blla'j aw])
              skin 2SG-scratch-cOMP- 3SG.NM.DAT
              'Scratch her! '
   This placement raises some questions about the nature of the juncture between the verb,
the dative suffix, and the completive marker. From sentences such as (2 1 3) it is clear that
the completive marker must occur sentence finally. From the sentences in §5.2.4 we can see
that the dative suffixes occur final on the verb, but freely allow nominals to appear in the
same clause following them. Sentences such as (2 1 5) thus run counter to the prediction that
82      Chapter 5we would find the dative suffix final on the verb, followed by the (possibly enclitic)
completive particle. At this point we have no clear explanation for this discrepancy.","[99, 100]"

2. 6. 1 Segmental restrictions
   Syllables may be maximally composed of a consonant cluster, a vowel, and an additional
vowel or glide. Word-final syllables may be maximally composed of a consonant, vowel,
and a vowel or glide. Word-initial syllables of polysyllabic words and word-medial syllables
may be maximally composed of a consonant and a vowel. Syllable templates are shown
below.
      Monosyllabic:      (C(d» V(G)
      Polysyllabic:      [(C)V]2, (C)V, [(C)V(G)]
    The only consonant clusters permitted involve a non-velar obstruent combined with the
voiced dentoalveolar stop Id/, word-initially on oral monosyllables. The Idl is realised as [r]
following It!, and as [1] elsewhere. This rule of distribution has been observed productively in
loan words such as primus 'primus stove' , which is pronounced as [plaj mr s ] by older
speakers. Note that the name 'Krisa' is not a possible I'saka word; folk etymology has that it
is the name of the Patrol officer (Chris) who used to visit the village in the 1 950s. Older
speakers pronounce the word as [klisa]. Green River, a prominent town inland in the
province, is similarly pronounced as [klin] ([grin] in Tok Pisin), and Christine, the name of an
anthropologist well-respected in the area, has been heard as [k[l]rsina], showing the
preference for the lateral with non-alveolar consonants, and perhaps the introduction of a
new [kl] cluster into the language (assuming that these words are not code-switchings into a
local variety of Tok Pisin). Some examples of attested words with these shapes are shown in
(3 8), as well as some examples of ungrammatical potential clusters:
30     Chapter 2     (38)       Ibdel             Ipdajl    Isdawl       Itd:)1       *kC      *jC             *wC
                [ble]             [p IV ]   [slaw]       [tro]
                'this'            'bad'     'dry'        'with'
     We may capture these restrictions on clusters with the following three constraints.
     *GC                           The first principal is a trivial instantiation of the principles of
                                   following a pattern of increasing sonority in a syllable: a
                                   complex onset involving a glide, w or y, followed by any non­
                                   vowel segment would violate this principle of increasing
                                   sonority.
     *CC[-dentoalveolar]           The second principle is also a reflection of this hierarchy:
                                   conceivably the sequences Cb and Ck could occur, with the
                                   lenited allophones of b and k, [{3] and [y], appearing: [t13V] or
                                   [tyV] , for instance. In practice this is not allowed, probably a
                                   reflection of the relative closeness of the stop and the fricative
                                   in terms of sonority. [Cr] is allowed, as the sonority difference
                                   is relatively great, but [Cy] is not, because there is insufficient
                                   increase.
     *VCCV                         This principle barring a consonant cluster in a non-initial
                                   syllable is specific to I'saka, and does not follow from phonetic
                                   naturalness; it must simply be listed.
     *CCV(cr)*                     The principle barring a consonant cluster in a polysyllabic word
                                   is also specific to I 'saka.
     *C[+velar]C                   This final principle barring a velar stop as the first member of
                                   a cluster cannot be predicted from any universalist principles.
    The glides Iwl and Iji are permitted in coda position on monosyllables or word-finally (that
is, they may appear only at the right edge of a word). This means that an alternative
formulation of the permitted syllable structures for words in I'saka is that shown in Figure 8,
in which the word-final glide is structurally not part of a particular syllable but is an
extrametrical segment in the word.

   Under this model the reduplication of verb roots would apply to the whole syllable and any
extrametrical segment associated with that syllable. The fact that these extra metrical glides
cannot be realised anywhere except word-finally, however, means that the glide has no
phonetic manifestation other than serving as a buffer to intervocalic lenition. The analysis of
the reduplication of dei 'I do' is shown in (39). Here we can see that reduplication applies to
                                                                                            Phonology   31the whole phonetic syllable, which can be of the allowed shape CVG (see Table 1 4). In the
reduplicated form, however, there is no position for the now medial glide to be realised; it
blocks intervocalic lenition, but is not structurally permitted at anything other than a word­
final position, and so is not realised on the word.

phonetic syllable reduplicated (as seen in §2.4.2). The fact that it is impossible for a glide to
be specified on the first syllable of a two (or more) -syllable word means that there is never a
conflict about the reduplication template, though interestingly this template applies to
phonetic syllables, including extrametrical material, and not to the underlyingly specified
syllable.
   Note that when a complex verb collocation is irrealis, it is only the second element that
undergoes reduplication. In (40) we can see that of the two-verb collocation -ana -ung (see
§5. 3 . 3) only the second verb is reduplicated:

32       Chapter 2   Very rarely, the segments [1] and [p] are found in coda position, and there is one instance
of a final [s] . The following examples are representative of such words (some additional
examples may be gathered from 1 0.2):
     (4 1 )    0::>1]       [bab::>l]         [k::>p]      [suzup]            [waws]
               'fence'      'sago grub'       'fence'      'grass'            'prawn'
     It is likely that these above examples are loan words: traditional farming methods amongst
the people of Krisa village do not employ fences, and so these terms are suitable candidates
for borrowing from a neighbouring language, such as Mbo, a Border language spoken in
nearby Osol, a village that has moved up from the Pual basin and, along with its fenced
gardens, is only a few hours walk away from Krisa. Kocher-Schmid ( 1 999) notes that plant
names are shared extensively throughout the Kilimeri cultural area, regardless of the
relatedness or unrelatedness of the languages in question, and so the chance of these terms
being originally loans from another language, perhaps brought in as alternants or as the
names of new varieties of the plant, and then generalised, is high. Unfortunately there is
little to no linguistic information available about these interior languages, so this cannot be
tested in detail.
    It is not entirely clear whether phonologically underlying glides (that is, segmental
phonemes) are permitted as word-medial syllable onsets, or whether their occurrence in this
position is a result of intervocalic epenthesis. For example, with a form such as [duw£] 'dog',
is the underlying form Idu£l, with an epenthetic glide, or Iduw£1? It is noticeable that some
intervocalic occurrences of the glide [w] consistently sound more like an onset than others.
For example, the glide in [duw£] 'dog' sounds more like a 'full' consonant than that of
[kasuW£] 'cassowary': it is perceptibly longer, is less likely to elide in fast speech, and more
likely to involve slight friction (though this is rare).","[47, 48, 49, 50]"

5.5 Functions of pronouns
   As described in §4. 1 , there are four pronoun sets in I'saka, with the maximum number of
distinctions found on the singular pronouns. Their morphological structure has been
presented in that section, and in this section we shall summarise their uses.
78       Chapter 55.5. 1    Personal pronouns
   We can note that the accusative pronouns bear a close resemblance to the human object
suffixes shown in Table 27 (§5 .2. 3). However, unlike the suffixes, the accusative pronoun
always precedes the verb. The recurrence of the sequence -pu in the nominative set is
interesting, as this possible morpheme/formative is exemplified in the data in other contexts
(most regularly, adverbs are also usually formed with -pu). Its putative independent meaning
appears to be something like 'emphatic ' or 'means of action '. This can be seen in the
following example, in which the appearance of the -pu seems to imply a strong causal link
between the two clauses:
     ( 1 90)   Bala         pz     k-ei       m6u-pu               d-ele '-le ' pili.
               tomorrow rain 3S0.M-do not.exist-EMPH? I S0-gO-<IRR> garden
               'If there's no rain tomorrow, then I 'll go to the garden. '
   Other support for the argument that this i s a (fossilised) morpheme is the fact that the
intervocalic /p/ is not prone to lenition - see §2 . 3 . 1 . The nominative form of the pronoun
is restricted to referents serving as the subject of the verbal clause, either bivalent or
monovalent, or the subject of a non-verbal clause. Some examples are:
     (191)     Depu       tei d-akai.
               I S0.NOM wood I so-cut
               'I cut wood.'
     (1 92)    Kepu          k-ele '  Awakali.
               3S0.M.NOM 3S0.M-go Vanimo
               'He's gone to Vanimo.'
   The unmarked form is the most common and flexible form of the pronoun, as it can have
a subject or dative referent, and may at times even be used as a possessive pronoun. It is
absolutely restricted only in that it may not appear as the object of a clause; this is always
reserved for the accusative pronominal set. Compare the sentence above with the following
nearly identical version using an unmarked pronoun:
     ( 1 93)   Kia     k-ele '   Awakali.
               3S0.M 3S0.M-go Vanimo
               'He's gone to Vanimo.'
   It is not well understood what motivates the choice of the unmarked form over the
nominative and possessive pronouns (or vice versa). Other examples of the unmarked
pronouns can be seen below, and in §4. 1 . 1 .
               Subject of verbal clause:
     ( 1 94)   Nana tra              n-ou.
               1 so     sago.delight 1 SO-eat
               'I ate sago delight.'
               Dative recipient:
     ( 1 95)   Buk n-ani-ma            mama.
               book I s0-give-2S0.DAT 2so
               'I gave you the book. '
                                                                            Morphology       79             Possessor in NP:
   ( 1 96)   Nai nana b-asa-ke.
             boy l SG      2SG-carry-3sG.M.H.OBJ
             'You carried my child.'
   The accusative pronouns are restricted to pronominal arguments serving as the object of a
bivalent clause; this is the only morphosyntactic environment in which they may appear, and
so they are the most restricted of the pronoun sets:
   ( 1 97)   Pi      bi        k-ang.
             rain.M 2SG.ACC 3SG.M-make.wet
             'The rain wets you. '
   A s mentioned above, the unmarked personal pronouns are able to carry a n inflection for
accompaniment, -sa :
   ( 1 98)   K -ele I  nana-sa.
             3SG.M-go l SG-ACCOM
             'He went with me. '
   This cannot occur with pronouns other than the unmarked pronoun set, though it is
grammatical with common and proper nouns (see §S . 1 .2):
   ( 1 99)   *depu-sa,             *die-sa
              l SG.NOM-ACCOM        1 SG .ACC-ACCOM
    Like proper names, the unmarked personal pronouns may also occasionally combine with
their corresponding dative suffixes. This creates yet another alternative possessive pronoun.
It is not known what motivates a speaker's choice of the nominative pronoun + dative suffix
combination over the possessive pronouns illustrated in Tables 20 and 2 1 .","[95, 96, 97]"
"
6. 1.3 Ordering of adjectives
   Adjectives exemplify a more complex and changeable set of ordering rules, with speakers
varying with respect to adjective usage. Essentially, in addition to appearing inside the NP in
which a nominal occurs, an adjective can also be found postverbally; this is a quite frequent
strategy. The two options for word order can be seen in the following sentences. In the first
sentence we can see an NP with both the noun and the adjective inside it. I t occurs
preverbally, as we would expect of a P.
     (253)     INP A     nuo ] k-ani-ung                Ros.
                  pig.M big       3SG.M-give-3sG.NM.DAT Rose
               'He gave a big pig to Rose.'
  The next sentence also has an element which is translated as 'big pig', but in this case the
noun a 'pig' occurs preverbally, and the adjective is found postverbally:
     (254)     Daka asongpa INP a ]         k-o             �DJ nuo].
               Man stealth(y)       pig.M 3SG.M-do.SG.M.OBJ     big
               'The stealthy man shot a big pig.'
  This section shall discuss the possibilities and restrictions of this split-modification
construction.
                                                                                   Syntax      89   In monovalent clauses, a subject-linked adjective occupies the peripheral (i.e. non­
subcategorised) postverbal slot, functioning as a secondary predicate (25 5):
   (255)    D-elel asongpa nil.
            l SG-go stealth(y) INTENSE
            'I go along, very stealthily. '
   In realis bivalent clauses a subject-linked adjective i s placed i n the noun phrase with the
subject, and the object-linked adjective fills the postverbal position, as seen earlier in (254).
We can thus conclude that the ability of an adjective to appear in a postverbal position is
dependent on the nominal that it refers to being the S or the P of the clause, that is, an
absolutive argument. This can be shown to be the case by examining the following clauses,
using the quantifier purupa 'all, complete' in a postverbal position. The first sentence has a
singular subject, so the interpretation of the quantifier as modifying the P is not surprising. In
the second clause, daka u is the only argument of the monovalent clause, and so the
interpretation is not in question.
   (256)    Su     n-ou      purupa.
            sago 1 SG-eat all
            'I ate all the sago. '
   (25 7)   Dakau onde purupa .
            children go.PL all
            'All of the children went.'
   This third clause shows a plural A and a potentially (and pragmatically likely) plural P; the
postverbal quantifier can only be interpreted as modifying the P, not the A, showing that this
quantification applies to an absolutive grouping: S and P, as opposed to A.
   (258)    Dakau su        oung purupa.
            children sago eat       all
            'The children ate all of the sago.'
            *'All of the children ate the sago. '
   It should be noted, however, that if a peripheral argument is already present postverbally,
both subject and object-linked adjectives must occur in the NP of the argument that binds
them, as seen in (25 3). One example, however, shows both a postverbal nominal and a
postverbal adjective: the post-verbal nominal is the apparent P of the sentence, but the scope
of the adjective is over the chaser duwe, not the chased yung-paul. This is evidence that the
clause is monovalent, not bivalent, and the nominal yung-pa ul is a true oblique, and not
simply an obliquely-coded P.
   (259)    Duwe abli yung-paul            amopa.
            dog     chase bird-chicken many
            'Lots of dogs are chasing after the chicken.'
   The following example illustrates the apparent unacceptability (at least prescriptively) of a
preverbal object-linked adjective when the postverbal position is empty.
   (260)    *depu       su     takau n-ou
            l SG.NOM sago hot        l SG-eat
            'I ate hot sago. '
90      Chapter 6   Although the above pattern is robustly attested (particularly the postverbal placement of
object-linked adjectives), exceptions have been observed. More data is necessary to be sure
of the rules of adjective placement, particularly with reference to the ordering of deictics and
possessive pronouns, and the presence of additional tense/aspect information (e.g. irrealis or
completive morphemes) in the clause. The current data suggests that all these elements are
relevant to adjective ordering.","[106, 107, 108]"
"
5. 7. 4 Prohibitive
  The prohibitive particle ni indicates that the clause is a negative command to the hearer.
As with the positive imperative described in §5 .7.3, it appears clause-finally:
  (227)    Di         m-a   nil
           l SG.ACC 2SG-hit PROHIB
           'Don't hit me !'
  (228)    Mama a b-o              nil
           2SG      pig 2SG-shoot PROHIB
           'Don't shoot the pig !'
   The prohibitive may be used with non-volitional predicates:
  (229)    Mama b-epili        nil
           2SG     2sG-afraid PROHIB
           'Don't be frightened ! '
84      Chapter 5   With respect to the variability of the position of the completive particle with respect to
dative suffixes, it seems that the prohibitive cannot precede the dative agreement markers:
     (230)      Mama we m-akane-na              ni.
                2SG     fish 2sG-hide- 1 SG.DAT PROHIB
                'Don't you hide my fish now ! '
     (23 1 )    B-ai-na              ni.
                2sG-take- 1 SG.DAT PROHIB
                'Don't take mine ! '
     (23 1 ),   *b-ai-ni-na
    The use of this particle may also occasionally be found in statements, not only in
commands. Thus, clauses with second person subjects are sometimes negated with ni PROHIB
rather than mi NEG, regardless of whether or not the speaker is actually commanding the
listener. An example of this can be seen in the following sentence, which cannot, because of
the time expression, be construed as being an imperative.
     (23 2)     Kelie     b-ele ' i'          ni.
                yesterday 2sG-go village PROHIB
                'You didn't go to the village yesterday. '
   Note that the lack of a recognisable 2SG inflection on the ni particle makes it less
convincing that the general imperative (§5 .7.3) is in fact inflected for this person, but is in
fact simple coincidence: the chance of a random consonant occurring to match the b- of the
2SG is high in a language with only eight consonants.","[101, 102]"
"                                Table 20: Singular personal pronouns                          Unmarked       Nominative    Accusative      Possessive

which are also found in the verbal affixes to mark subject, object and dative. These are the
use of Idl for first person, fbi for second person, Ik/ for third person masculine, and Iwl or lui
for third person non-masculine. It is also worth noting that the accusative pronouns, marked
by a high vowel Iii and (in careful speech) lei, bear a close resemblance to the human object
suffixes (shown in Table 27), and probably reflect a close historical relationship. However,
unlike the object-marking suffixes, the accusative pronoun always precedes the verb, and is
not bound; the grammaticalisation pathway between the two forms is at best distant. There
are again striking resemblances between the accusative pronouns and the possessive ones,
which appear to consist of the reduced accusative plus the dative suffix (see §5.2.4). The
nominative set is marked by the recurrence of the final sequence pu, which shows intriguing
phonological similarities to the same sequence in other contexts (these include its appearance
as a common adverbial ending, suggesting a common sense of 'performance of an action' as
a component of the meaning of the [once-productive?] formative). Furthermore, the first
vowel of all the nominative pronouns varies between e and a : in addition to the forms listed
above, dapu, bapu, kapu and wopu (not *wapu , showing clear influence of the initial w) are
also heard for the nominative, from the same speakers that produce depu, etc . The same
applies to the last vowel of the accusative pronouns: in addition to being optionally omitted,
older speakers are known to use an a instead of e : dia, bia , kia , thus collapsing the
unmarkedlaccusative distinction for the 3 SG.M.
    As mentioned above, the unmarked personal pronouns can be marked for cases. They are
able to carry a case marker for accompaniment, sa , and function as adjuncts in clauses (see
§5 . 1 .2). Like proper names, the unmarked personal pronouns may also occasionally combine
with their corresponding dative suffixes. This creates another alternative possessive pronoun.
   (6 1 )   nana      +   -na      �     nanana
            l sG          - l SG.DAT     l SG.POSS
   The motivation behind a speaker's choice of the nominative pronoun + dative suffix
combination over the possessive pronouns is unclear, though it might be that the unmarked
pronoun + dative suffix strategy is more 'colloquial' or 'informal' than the use of the
                                                                   Pronominal forms         47dedicated possessive pronouns. More extensive and systematic checking of texts is needed to
confirm this hypothesis. Not enough data is available to draw any conclusions about the
discourse conditions that motivate one strategy over another, and speakers all report that the
unmarked pronoun + dative suffix strategy may replace a possessive pronoun in all contexts
queried.","[64, 65]"
"   Temporals have scope over the whole clause, providing a time for events relative to the
utterance. Only three distinct temporals have been identified: kelie (or, sometimes, kelia)
'yesterday, before today' , buru 'today, now', and ba la 'tomorrow, later on '. Deictics
similarly exhibit three distinct forms, but the contrast encoded in the different forms is not a
simple one of spatial distance. The proximal and distal deictics are opposed in space, but the
third deictic has a discourse function rather than a spatial function. Three postpositions
(expressing location, accompaniment and instrumental) are also found.
   Five clause-final particles have been identified, and it is expected that others also exist.
These cover a range of semantic and grammatical functions. Their domain includes tense/
aspect/mood and negation; they have been grouped together on the basis of their common
position in, and scope over, the clause.
   Additionally there are several other particles and word-types that are only rarely found in
our data and are poorly understood. These remain unclassified on semantic or morphological
grounds, though they are listed in §3 .5.",[57]
"
6.3 Negation   Negation can be marked only once for the clause, and it is always at the end of the clause,
following both the predicate and any oblique nominals that are in clause-final position.
The negative particle, mi, is invariant for person, number, gender or tense/aspect/mood
distinctions:
     (270)     Di          wii-na           mi.
               l SG.ACC 3SG.NM.do- 1 SG.DAT NEG
               'I 'm not sick. '
     (27 1 )   Bu dina         ml.
               that l SG.POSS NEG
               'That's not mine.'
   Despite the invariant position of the negative marker at the end of the whole clause, the
scope does not necessarily apply over the entire clause. In the following construction, which
contains both an accompaniment and a locative oblique argument following the verb, the
accompaniment argument can be negated without negating the rest of the clause:
     (272)     Tani ' k-ele '     moni' tro pli      mi.
               father 3SG.M-go mother with garden NEG
               'Dad went to the garden without Mum.'
    The example above is ambiguous, with the additional reading 'Dad didn't [go to the
garden with Mum] ' (and so no-one went). Nevertheless, all speakers who were consulted
agreed that the reading of the sentence given in the translation above is also a normal
interpretation of the scope of the negative.
    In an inflected adverbial + light verb 'do' construction, it is the former dependent verb that
is negated, as illustrated in the example below:
                                                                                   Syntax     93   (273)    Tra d-asi        d-ei    mi.
            sago 1 SG-well 1 SG-do NEG
           'I made the sago badly.'
            (*1 didn't [make sago (well)].)
   The topic of scope of negation deserves more detailed treatment than can be presented
here, and it is hoped that further works on I'saka grammar can delve into this topic in more
depth.","[110, 111]"

2. 6.2 Suprasegmental restrictions
   There are no absolute restrictions on the co-occurrence of individual segments or classes
of segments with different suprasegmental features. All vowels and consonants are found
with all tonal environments, and with both values of nasality. Despite this, some clear
tendencies are worth noting. The high front vowel Iii is most frequently associated with a
high tone, and the low central vowel lal is most frequently associated with a low tone. This
reflects universal correlations between vowel height and Fo (Rombert 1 97 8 : 1 02).
   There is a constraint on the phonotactic complexity of words and the appearance of
contrastive nasalisation. Nasalisation is permitted on all syllables except those containing
consonant clusters; we may represent this constraint as follows:
     (42)     * CCV
                 \/
                 nasal2     This word has also been heard with a metathesised variant [ojsp(w)o].
                                                                                  Phonology        33   This means that a large number of otherwise potentially permissible syllables are not
attested, those of the form pdV (G)/, /bdV (G)/, ItdV (G)/ and IsdV (G)/ . It is suggestive about
a possible earlier segmental stage of the nasalisation prosody, in which syllable-final nasals
were perhaps permitted (recall that there are no unambiguous codas in modern I'saka). It
might have been the case that, in a language that permitted CVGN and CCVG, the sequence
CCVGN was too 'heavy', and so barred from appearing. An alternative account of this
restriction is presented below.
    Synchronically, we can summarise the phonotactic restrictions associated with nasality
and its interaction with initial clusters in Table 1 5 .","[50, 51]"

     The usual conventions for glossing first, second and third person as 1 , 2 and 3 have been
followed. A, S and P have been used descriptively to represent the syntactic roles of most
agentive arguments of a primary transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as it does),
single argument of an intransitive predicate, and most patientive argument of a primary
transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as they do), respectively, following Comrie
( 1 978) and Andrews ( 1 985:6 8). The following additional abbreviations are used in the text
and in glosses of examples:  ACC          accusative                          N      weak phonetic nasalisation

Xli   Abbreviations   Standard glossing conventions are used to break up vernacular text and its equivalent on
the morpheme line: the hyphen '- ' is used to separate morphemes forming one phonological

word, and a space ' is used to mark off separate words. Punctuation marks are used
according to English conventions. The usual star ' *' is used to indicate an ungrammatical
utterance, while a hash '#' is used for one that is either infelicitous for a particular context, or
else acceptable only for some speakers, or one about which speakers vacillate in their
judgements from time to time.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

              a command, despite the vocative use of a [necessarily third person]
              nominal sentence-initially.)
   It is not known what motivates a speaker's choice of one of these constructions over the
other. An alternative mode of inflection for object is found productively with verbs that take
an adjunct nominal, and use the dative suffixes to mark the affected experiential object.
   The second class of bivalent verbs, the vast majority of verbs in the lexicon, normally
shows no marking for object.","[80, 81]"

1. 4.3    Vernacular literacy
   There is very little material available in the I'saka language. Writing the I'saka language
has very much been a matter of individual choice. As far as we are aware, there have been
only a few attempts by villagers to write their language, although Stefanie Klappa stirred
speaker interest in this area. Most people were reasonably keen to try writing I'saka when
asked, and one proved to be a prolific writer, producing pages of sentences and lists of plants
and animals. These were written with an idiosyncratic and unsystematic adaptation of the
Tok Pisin orthography, with no systematic indication of nasalisation or tone. This served the
author quite well to write with, but sometimes required a lot of effort to decode (read), even
for the writer himself. The current I'saka orthography is discussed in §2.7.
   Adult responses to the notion of a vernacular literacy program within the village school
were unfailingly positive, with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The teachers were pleased at
the thought of a suitable orthography and some vernacular literacy materials, as they are
now officially supposed to use I'saka as a vehicle for teaching initial reading and writing
skills. However, for the reasons outlined below, it is difficult to see how a vernacular literacy
program for the early grades would progress.
   At the time of our work, two of the three teachers at the Krisa school I'saka speaker as she
has been away from the village for many years. This means that teachers of any proposed
vernacular literacy programme would be attempting to instruct children in a language that
would be largely unknown to themselves, and not used in day-to-day interaction by the
children, a clearly problematic situation (although not unusual in Papua New Guinea).
Another important factor is that many Krisa children do not use any I'saka with their families
and converse solely in Tok Pisin, making the language of 'first literacy' unfamiliar to both
teachers and pupils. We might expect that family language use would alter if the school were
able to commence a strong I'saka-based programme, but even so it would be an uphill battle
given the level of Tok Pisin use in all spheres of life.
2           Phonology
   Krisa displays contrasts on both the segmental and supra segmental levels, with
considerable cross-influence between the systems in terms of allophonic occurrences.
Although the layers of phonology show considerable interaction, we shall describe them
sequentially, integrating as necessary, and then summarise the interactions at the end of this
section.","[30, 31]"

4. 1. 1 Unmarked pronouns
   The unmarked pronoun is the most common and flexible form of the pronoun, appearing
in a wider range of contexts than any of the other pronominal sets. The referent can be a
subject or dative referent, and at times the unmarked set of pronouns is even used as
possessive pronouns. Additionally, an overtly marked oblique pronoun must be drawn from
the unmarked set (such as accompanying participants, which are marked with tro attached to
a pronoun from the unmarked set, as in (95) in §5 . 1 .2). The only restriction on the function
of this pronominal set is that it may not be used to mark a referent which is the object of a
bivalent clause.
   It is not yet well understood what motivates the choice of the unmarked pronominal forms
when a more highly specified, and equally suitable pronominal set is available for the
function required, such as the nominative pronouns for subjects or the possessive pronouns
for objects.
   Examples of the use of the unmarked pronouns in different syntactic contexts appear in
the sentences below.
           Unmarked pronoun as subject of a bivalent clause:
   (62)    Nana tra              n-ou.
           1 SG     sago.delight l SG-eat
           'I ate sago delight.'
           Unmarked pronoun as dative referent:
   (63)    Buk n-ani-ma            mama .
           book l SG-give-2SG.DAT 2SG
           'I gave you the book. '
           Unmarked pronoun a s possessor:
   (64)    �p Nai nana ] b-asa-ke.
              boy l SG      2sG-carry-3sG.M.H.OBJ
           'You carried my child. '
           Unmarked pronoun as un-indexed oblique:
   (65)    Kapu k-ele '       umu.
           3SG.M 3SG.M-go 3SG.NM
           'He went to her.'
           (The meaning encoded in this sentence would be more commonly
           expressed with a dative suffix on the verb: Kapu k-ele-ung 'He went to
           her', Kepu k-au-na 'He came to me'.)
48      Chapter 4   From the wide range of functions in which the unmarked set of pronouns appears it is
clear that they are not specified for grammatical features other than the pronominal ones that
they exist to mark.","[65, 66]"
"
5. 7.3 Imperative
  The imperative particle mu indicates that the clause is a command to the hearer. As such,
mu is found only with verbal predicates that have a second person inflection for subject.
                                                                         Morphology       83   (222)   B-ele ' mu!
           2SG-go IMP
           'Go ! '
   (223)   [sang s-ele'   mu!
           2DU 2DU-go IMP
           'You two, go now !'
   (224)   Yumu yi-nore '     mu!
           2PL      2PL-go.PL IMP
           'All of you, go now!'
   (225)   SU   b-ei     mu!
           sago 2SG-do IMP
           'Make the sago ! '
   The fact that this particle begins with m-, the nasal allomorph of the 2SG subject prefix,
leads one to suspect that it may in fact be (or at least originate from) a dependent verb
inflected for 2SG subject. As imperative clauses are generally pragmatically restricted to
second person in any case, this might be plausible, except for the fact that examples of 2PL
and 2DU subjects also show mu, not *yfng (putatively expected, if the hypothesised ung was
an inflecting verb). It should also be noted that this construction was heard very rarely,
though it was freely accepted when materials were checked. Other, less compelling,
imperatives are formed with no additional morphology:
   (226)   B-au       m-ou!
           2SG-come 2sG-eat
           'Come and eat ! '
   A sequence of the negative m i (see §6 .3) and the imperative m u i s not grammatical for
negated imperatives, since there is a special prohibitive marker ni.","[100, 101]"
"
5. 7.2 Negative
   Negation is expressed on all clauses, with verbal, adjectival or nominal predicates, with
the negative particle mi, which appears clause-finally. Some examples of use of the negative
are shown below, with verbal and adjectival predicates.
     (2 1 6)   Pi      k-ei      mi.
               rain.M 3SG.M-do NEG
               'It won't rain. '
     (2 1 7)   Wasa dina         taka mi.
               basket 1 SG.POSS heavy NEG
               'My basket isn't heavy.'
     With a nominal predicate the same negator is used:
     (2 1 8)   A     dina       mi.
               pig.M 1 SG.POSS NEG
               '(That's) not my pig. '
   The predicate alone may be mentioned with the negative particle, if the subject of the
clause is retrievable from the discourse. This is true for both verbal and non-verbal
predicates:
     (2 1 9)   Dina       mi.
               1 SG .poss NEG
               '(That's) not mine.'
   In combination with the irrealis, the sense of negation can apply to the physical possibility,
not necessarily solely the negation of the future event:
     (220)     Depu d-ele'-le'          ycmg-ri mi.
               1 SG    I SG-gO-<IRR> leg-INSTR NEG
               'I'm not up to going on foot. ' OR 'I 'm not going to go by foot. '
      Negative existence (,there i s n o _' ) i s expressed with mou:
     (22 1 )   SU    mou.
               sago not.exist
               'There's no sago. '
   As with the completive, the negative is not a verb-final particle, but a clause-final one.
This can be shown with sentences in which there is a postverbal element, which can intrude
between the verb and the negator (though see §S.2. 1 ).",[100]
"
2.2.2 Nasalisation
   As mentioned earlier, I'saka exhibits contrastive nasalisation, even though no nasal
consonants or vowels have been listed in §2. 1 . The appearance of a nasalisation contrast is
not unexpected, but the realisation of that contrast deserves special discussion for I'saka,
which will be provided in this section. The contrasts shown by nasalisation can be
exemplified in the minimal pairs shown in Table 7.

                                   'heart'               'none'   In this table we can see contrasts both in the nasalisation of vowels, and in the nasalisation
of the initial consonant. This is not, however, nasalisation that is contrastive on either the
onset or on the vowel, but rather contrastive at the syllable level. The contrasts shown
in Table 7 above in phonetic transcription are best represented phonologically as shown in
Table 8.","[35, 36]"

of approximately 300-400m, and looks south across the Pual valley to the Bewani mountains
(see Figure 1 ). The location of Krisa and its surrounds in a broader New Guinea context is
shown in Figure 2. In this map the shaded area represents the area of the map seen in
Figure 1 .
   Krisa can be reached by a four-hour walk along a dirt road from Pasi, which is accessible
by vehicle from Vanimo. The population of the village itself numbers approximately 600
(more than half of whom are children), and nearly the same number of people live in
outlying settlement camps that follow the road to the coast (Klappa 1 99 9a, 1 999d),
terminating in Pasi, the last I'saka-speaking settlement, which lies just off the northern slopes
of the Oenake ranges. Finally, a few Krisa families live in Vanimo town; no Krisa people
live further away than the surrounding villages, where they are found due to marriage to
Osol, Osima or Ningera. This yields a total possible population for the ethnic group of
somewhat less than 1 000.","[20, 21]"

5.2.3 Object inflection
   Independent bivalent verbs can be divided into two morphologically distinct classes. The
first class, a minority pattern, marks the gender and number (singular/dual being relevantly
grouped together as non-plural, NPL, opposed to plural, PL) of the object on the verb. This
may be accomplished in one of two ways: either through the use of suppletive verb-forms, or
through the use of more delimitable affixation - 'delimitable' in the sense that the
correspondences of pronominal values to the segments employed for their encoding match
the paradigms seen elsewhere. (In fact, calling this 'affixation' may be jumping the gun as
there are too few examples known to be sure that we are really dealing with regular affixes
that mean 'masculine non-plural object', etc., as opposed to patterns of lexical suppletion.)
Table 26 shows two examples of the class of verbs that mark some value of the object by
suppletive verb forms; the examples given here have been inflected for first person singular
subject (d-) as well as the inflection for object. The first example, with the verb -ai 'get' ,
shows what may b e analysable a s object affixes. The rightmost column illustrates the
patterns found with the verb -ei 'do', and shows object-governed suppletion, or at best object
                                                                                 Morphology   61affixation and major morphophonological changes. Although the prevalence of suppletive
forms makes it difficult to posit a root for the verb 'do', the third person non-masculine
object form -ei is considered to be the most unmarked, in terms of its range of application,
frequency of occurrence, and appearance in elicitation. As such, it has been treated as the
underlying form throughout.
                                     Table 26: Object prefixes                     SUBJ      OBJ            'take, get', [-aj]   'do', [-ej]
                      l SG     3NPL.NM           d-ai               d-ei
                               3NPL.M            d-akai             d-o
                               3PL               d-alai             d-ou   If the verb 'take' in the table above illustrates a productive (or at least regular, and not
entirely suppletive) object marking pattern, then the morphemes used to index the values of
                                                                                              ,
the object are prefixal to the verb root; the morphological structure of 'I take (masculine)
would most logically be PrefsuBJ-PrefoBJ-V, as in the following segmented example.
   ( 1 07)   d-ak-ai
             l SG-3SG.NPL.M-take
                                 ,
             'I take (masculine)
   Here the use of the k consonant in the prefix is reminiscent of the appearance of this
consonant in various places in paradigms involving third person singular masculine
arguments. We would posit the prefixes ak- and al-, the only consonant-final morphemes in
the language. With 'do', however, it is hard to isolate a single element that can be said to be
added to an otherwise basically invariant verb root. It could well be the case that prefixes of
the form V- and VG- are added and the rhyme of the prefix overwrites that of the verb root,
in a process similar to that described for vowel coalescence when subject prefixes of the
shape CV - are added to verbs (§5 .2.2). If this is the case, the prefixes are 0- '3NPL.M .OBJ'
and ou- 'PL.OBJ' (/'Jw/). An example of the verb 'do' inflected for non-plural masculine
object is given in:
   ( 1 08)   [d'J]
             /d-'J-Ej!
             l SG.sUBJ-3SG.NPL.M.OBJ-do
             'I do (masculine).'
             (See §5.2.2 for a discussion of the process of rhyme replacement in verbs
             following the syllabification of extrametrical elements, arguing that rather
             than simply vowel replacement, there is a more complex process involved.)
   For ease of glossing, only the features 'plural ' and 'masculine' will be indicated in the
gloss lines, as these seem to represent elements that, historically at least, were added to the
roots. Thus, d-ei will be glossed simply as l sG-do, not l SG-do.NPL.NM ; d-o will be glossed
as l sG-do.M, and d-ou as l sG-do.pL. The features non-singular and non-masculine will not
be explicitly marked in the glosses, as they represent the unmarked categories.
   In addition to these verbs with irregular (in the sense of less easily segmentable) means of
marking object values on the verb, a small and semantically distinct subset of this class takes
a regular set of suffixes that indicate number, person and gender of a human object (H .OBJ).
62       Chapter 5Those forms that are known are shown in Table 27, followed by some examples. It should
be noted that the human object suffixes bear the same 'signature' person/gender phonemes
(/dI: 1 sG, fb/: 2sG, 1kI: 3 SG.M and /w/: 3SG.NM) as the subject prefixes. These onsets tend not
to lenite intervocalically, implying that there are different degrees of morpheme juncture
involved here, possibly involving c1iticisation, compared to the lenition that occurs when
subject prefixes are reduplicated (support, albeit circumstantial, for this position is the
ambiguity of the position of the dative suffixes when in proximity to the completive marker
- see §S.7. 1 ).
                                   Table 27: Human object suffixes                                            SG           DU           PL                                1          -de           -si          ?

                                3 .M       -ke/-ki       -l          -l
                                3 .NM      -wi   Examples of the use of these suffixes can be found in the following sentences; these
represent examples from both of the only two verbs that have been consistently observed to
occur with this set of object markers.
     ( 1 09)    M-opa-wi.
                2sG-carry.on.shoulder-3sG.NM .H.OBJ
                'You carried her on your shoulders. '
     ( 1 1 0)   Nai d-esi            d-epa-ki       yang-yang. 2
                boy l SG-carry l SG-put-3sG.M.H.OBJ leg-leg
                'I 'll hold the boy on my lap. '
     All observed occurrences of the human object suffixes are on verbs of carrying and
holding, such as shown with -opa 'carry on shoulder' and -epa 'place (on lap)' in sentences
( 1 09) and ( 1 1 0), and also (not exemplified here) -aisuso 'carry on side, carry on hip' and the
more generic -asa 'carry'. The use of the appropriate object suffix is obligatory in those
constructions exemplified above, and has not been observed, or accepted, with any other
verbs. We might reasonably assume that any bivalent verb that could satisfy the semantic
criteria (which we might define as 'envelopment of an animate (human?) object') would also
combine with the suffixes, but no verbs other than those listed here have been recorded with
the object suffixes. The fact that another verb of carrying, -asei 'carry by attaching to a pole
on shoulder', does not allow for object suffixes implies that the envelopment part of the
semantics is important.
     A few examples have been noted of 'carrying' verbs being used in an alternative
construction, in series with the verb -ei 'do', as in example ( 1 1 1 ) below. In this instance, the
human object suffix is omitted. The use of an accusative object-referencing pronoun, such as
die, is, however, obligatory.","[78, 79, 80]"
"
5. 7.5 Dubitative
   The dubitative marker wo is found at the end of clauses as a marker of uncertainty on the
part of the speaker about the truth of the utterance. It may be used as a marker of
evidentiality, to indicate that the speaker is not vouching for the veracity of the statement, or
it may be a marker of uncertainty about the future plausibility of the sentence:
     (23 3)     Tra           bima       ble nu ble w-oung            wo . . .
                sago.delight 2SG.POSS that girl that 3SG.NM-eat DUB
                'That sago delight of yours, that girl might have eaten it (I think;
                but I don't know either). '
     (234)      Bala      tu-tu              wo . . .
                tomorrow 3SG.NM.come-RED DUB
                'She might come tomorrow (but I 'm not sure).'
    As indicated in the examples above, the dubitative particle is often lengthened, [WJ:::] .
Further, it is associated with a slow down-gliding intonation contour, both on the particle
itself and to a lesser extent on the rest of the preceding clause. An additional example of this
particle, in a richer context, can be seen in the text in §7.4.
6           Syntax
   In this section we shall discuss various basic elements of the syntax of rsaka that are not
easily described in terms of morphological possibilities or morphological restriction. These
include the word order of elements of the clause and of the noun phrase, and some simple
features of clausal conjunction. By no means are the syntactic structures of rsaka
completely described in this section, but rather only a small and immediately salient selection
of constructions are presented, selected more for their frequency of appearance than
necessarily for their typological unusualness.","[102, 103]"
"
5.3.2 Adjunct nominals
   Nouns also play a prominent role in building complex and explicit predicate semantics for
clauses which use the light verb -ei 'do' as their main inflecting verb. This is done in two
main ways: either through the use of a preverbal non-inflecting nominal specifier, for
example makaing in the complex predicate makaing d-ei 'I help' ; or through knowledge of
the nature of the main participants. For an example of this latter strategy, a clause consisting
of a human subject, an animate animal object, and the verb -ei 'do' will be interpreted as
'(Human) shoots/kills (animal)', based on the shared knowledge of the cultural world in
which I'saka speakers live. In a sentence with a human subject and a normally human-made
tool or artifact as the object, the verb -ei 'do' will be interpreted to mean 'make, process'.
72      Chapter 5   Some examples of other adjunct nominals that are frequently found, and the verbs that
they have been heard with, include (but are not restricted to):
        wang       'song'                            wang k-ei          'He sings. '
        sit        'sago'                            sit k-ei           'He processes sago.'
        dou        'hand'                            dou k-ei           'He claps. '
        susup      'grass'                           susup k-akai       'He cleans/cuts grass. ,t
        kasue      'cassowary'                       kasue k-ei         'He shoots a cassowary.'
        suwe       'laughter'                        suwe k-usue        'He laughs. '
       t This collocation requires the plural object form of the verb 'get', since cutting
          grass necessarily involves cutting more than just one blade - see §5 .2.3.
   Although this area of I'saka syntax has not been investigated in detail, it is easy to note the
ease with which independent nouns can be used with their culturally appropriate meaning,
and the ease with which Tok Pisin loans are incorporated into the language by means of this
construction, such as bal k-ei 'he plays with a ball', raitim k-ei 'he writes'Joto k-ei 'he takes
a photo', helpim k-ei 'he helps' (a synonym with the construction using native I'saka
morphemes makaing k-ei 'help(?) he-does'), we i k-ei 'he waits ' « Tok Pisin we tim;
synonymous k-akaing 'he waits', with the same morphosyntax, involving a dative-coded P),
or wari k-ei 'he worries'. For this last reading the native I'saka equivalent does not use an
adjunct nominal, but rather a purely nominal construction:
     ( 1 63)   Nana bou plai-na .
               l SG   throat bad- 1 SG.DAT
               'I'm worried. '
    The accusative case may, for some speakers, also be used here: #Die bou plaina, though
the apparently topic- like prominence of the l sG body-part possessor argument in this
construction makes this a less common strategy; this is in contrast to the common use of the
accusative pronouns in constructions with adjunct nominals (see, for instance ( 1 3 2), in which
the accusative pronouns are more normal, because the subject position in the clause is not
filled by the adjunct nominals ta l or nika nua.
    This sort of nominal construction, using modified body parts to predicate an emotional or
socially recognised condition, is found in other collocations as well without the dative
suffixes:
     ( 1 64)   Nana you              kaipa .
               1 SG     stomach one
               'I 'm cool about it. 'I 'I'm content. '/'I 'm not making a fuss over it. '
   The fact that the patently recent loans are fully incorporated into the morphosyntactic
system of I'saka, and are not (at least obvious) examples of code-switching, can be seen in
their occurrence with the full range of inflection, as in the following two examples, in which
the Tok Pisin nounsfoto 'photograph' and save 'knowledge' are used in I'saka sentences.
     ( 1 65)   Foto k-ei-ma.
               photo 3SG.M-do-2sG.DAT
               'He's taking a photo of you. '
                                                                            Morphology       73    ( 1 66) Save        d-ei  ml.
            knowledge l SG-do NEG
            'I don't know.'
    The productivity of this construction with loan words, and the non-compositional nature
of the semantics of the resulting complex verb, implies that it is a highly salient construction
in need of more investigation. It should not be thought that the number of Tok Pisin
borrowings in these constructions indicates that the language has a deficient or less rich
system of expression, or that it is currently undergoing massive relexification and/or
language shift. In addition to sentences like A d-o pig 1 SG-do, meaning 'I shot a pig', people
in Krisa also say A sutim d-o, with Tok Pisin sutim 'shoot' incorporated into the structure as
a semantically specific adjunct nominal. Even though there is a (clearly recent) explicit
coding strategy for 'shooting', the non-adjunct nominal construction with nothing more than
the light verb 'do' is also perfectly acceptable and normal, albeit (from a European linguistic
perspective) highly underspecified semantically. The cultural context (what do people do to
pigs?), given the discourse in which it occurs (what do people do to pigs, in the bush, when
they've taken their dog and bow and a handful of arrows?), make the various, linguistically
ambiguous, uses of the light verb perfectly communicative for I'saka speakers. A similar
strategy has been noted in populous Dravidian languages such as Tamil, using English words
as adjuncts to the light verb 'do', alongside native lexemes, with no evidence of language
shift or even necessarily diglossia operating.","[89, 90, 91]"
"
5. 1.2 Accompaniment and location
   The case markers sa and tro appear on some oblique noun phrases to more closely specify
the meaning than simply general oblique, which is implied by the NP appearing in a
postverbal position. Sa is used to show accompaniment, and tro can be used with this
function, or to indicate a specifically interior location (within). The former, sa, is used only
infrequently, and not accepted by some speakers; for those that do use it, sa appears at the
start of the NP, not final. Tro is often omitted from speech, with the simple locative coding
sufficing for its sense.
   Examples of these case markers can be seen in the following phrases:
   (9 1 )   K-ele '-le'    sa        Dominic.
            3SG.M-gO-RED ACCOM Dominic
            'He went with Dominic. '
   (92)     Bala     d-ele'-le '   Pasi Robert-tro.
            tomorrow 1 SG-gO-RED Pasi Robert-ACCOM
            'Tomorrow I 'm going to Pasi with Robert. '
56     Chapter 5  Note that the order of the accompanier and the goal is not fixed, as can be seen by
comparing the last sentence with the following:
     (93)     D-ele '-le '   Simon-tro      Awakali.
              l SG-gO-RED Simon-ACCOM Vanimo
              'I 'm going to go to Vanimo with Simon.'
   We can see in these examples that the postverbal accompaniment NP does not contribute
to the set of pronominal features that are marked on the verb: in (93) the verb is marked for
a singular subject, and indeed plural marking is ungrammatical in this case. I f the
accompanier is presented in the subject position with the affix -sing, from sie 'two', then the
verb takes dual marking, as in:
     (94)     Bala     Simon-sing        s-ele '-le'       Pasi.
              tomorrow Simon-DU.ACCOM I DU-go-RED Pasi
              'Tomorrow Simon and 1 are going to Pasi. ' l
  Another use of tro i s almost instrumental in function, though i t i s less of a n 'intermediary
agent' than a -ri marked instrument. An example of this use is:
     (95)     Ubuei        tey       omu-tro            we owai.
              poison.root milk/sap 3SG.NM-ACCOM fish 3 PL.die
              'Fish die because of the sap of the poisonous vine. '
              (The regular form of the 3SG.NM pronoun is umu (see §4. 1 ); the lowered
              initial vowel here might be due to the presence of the low vowel in the
              suffix - tro , or it might be a dissimilatory effect brought on by the
              preceding high glide in tey.)
   Here we can see that a non-agentive effector is marked not as an A, but as an oblique
cause, while the patient is marked as the S of the clause.
   It is also worth noting the identity in form between the accompaniment marker tro and the
locational noun tro 'inside'. Similar syncretism between duwe ' 'ground', 'outside' can also be
found (see § l O. l ).","[73, 74]"

bilabial - (dento)alveolar - velar, and in voicing. Among the alveolar consonants,

(labiovelar vs palatal). Some examples of minimal or near-minimal word-initial contrasts

place contrasting, and all manner and voicing distinctions being neutralised. See §2.3 for a
discussion of the reduced contrasts available in this position. Word finally there are no stops
in native words (see §2.6. 1 ).
   The phonemic status of the voiceless bilabials is problematic. The phones [p] and [4>] (and
also occasionally [fn are heard in non-contrastive free variation, with no discernible
environmental motivation. Although we can observe some tendencies, they are not consistent
enough to posit allophony. One interpretation is that there were originally two voiceless
bilabial phonemes contrasting in manner of articulation, and these are currently merging,
(perhaps motivated by the lack of such a contrast in Tok Pisin and neighbouring languages
such as Dumo, Dusur, Ningera and Bo). Alternatively, the phones once shared an allophonic
relationship that has become confused. For the sake of consistency, [p], [4>] and [f] will be
treated as realisations of a phoneme Ip/.","[31, 32]"

10.2 Won Wake's supplementary lists
   In addition to the general lexical materials presented above, the following specific species
names are shown. M uch of the material in these lists has not been checked, but has been
included in the interests of making a more complete record available to a wider audience, as
the future of further lexicographic work on the language is not certain. I n some cases the
words have already appeared in the lists above; they have been repeated in Wou Wake's lists
to give an accurate record of the words that he felt it necessary to include. Many of the
following words show unusual phonotactic patterns, possibly reflecting loans (see §2.6. 1 ). It
should be noted that Wou uses f and p interchangeably; those forms that have been heard
show the same alternations that are found elsewhere in the language, and which we represent
simply with p .","[128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133]"

5.2. 4 Argument inflection using the dative suffix
   A range of non subcategorised participants are marked on the verb using the dative suffix.
The fact that the nominal is peripheral can be judged by its appearance in a postverbal
position, a position reserved for oblique arguments. 3 Although there is a large range of
possible referents, with different and non-conflicting semantic roles, only one instance of the
dative suffix may appear in any one clause; the criteria for choosing which of the possible
referents of the dative suffix will be chosen in the event of two or more possible candidates
are not yet known, though it does seem that, while semantically not incompatible, it is
unlikely from a discourse point of view that two of the possible candidates for coding will
appear in the one clause.
   This suffix demands an animate referent, and can be used to encode recipient,
beneficiary, goal, experiencer and possessor (usually the possessor of the object of a bivalent
verb). The forms of the dative suffix are shown in Table 28, and some examples of its use
are reproduced below. Some forms are identical to the human object suffixes shown in
Table 27.",[81]

2.5.3 Glide deletion
   At a surface-phonemic level we require a rule by which glides are deleted before a
consonant. This rule is clearly one that can only apply in non-monomorphemic environments,
otherwise there would be no evidence for the existence of the glide in the first place. We may
express the rule as follows:
28      Chapter 2     (31)    G � 0/ _C
    Alternations are detectable when a verb shows reduplication for irrealis mood, as
described in §2.4.2. The example below shows how irrealis reduplication of the syllable
[now] ' l sG-eat' results in [n:mow] not *[nownow]. When the root, /d-::Jw/-N, a monosyllable,
is reduplicated a sequence of glide plus stop is created. The glide in the resulting first syllable
is not realised, and the vowel of that first syllable is not raised, as would be expected in a
diphthong environment.
                N                     N                     N        N
                I                      I                     I       I
     (32)   /d-::Jw/ � [now]        /d::JW/<IRR>       �   [dowdow]
             ' l SG -eat'
                                                            N N
                                                             I   I
                                                       � [d::Jdow]
                                                       � [mnow] * [nownow]   Alternatively, one could argue that the reduplicative morpheme specifies a CV template
(including, additionally, the nasality and tone specification of the root), rather than the
proposed entire syllable template. If this were the case the glide would not require deletion,
but would simply not be included in the reduplication template:
     (33)   /d-::Jw/-N   �       /d::J-d::Jw/-NN   �       [n::Jnow]
             CV
   The behaviour of reduplicated non-nasal monosyllables, however, suggests that it is the
whole syllable that is being reduplicated, and that the glide is subsequently deleted so as to
avoid the occurrence of a disallowed cluster (*GC). For example, reduplication on the l SG
subject-inflected verb /d-£j! ' l SG-do' results in [d£dej] not *[d£lej], which we would predict
from the /d/ � [1] rules outlined above. The presence of the glide blocks the /d/ � [1]
process, as the required environment of V_V is not present. (This analysis assumes that d­
lateralisation occurs before glide deletion):
     (34)   /d-£j!     � [dej]    /d-£j!<IRR>      �   {d£jd£j} (d � 1 does not apply)
            ' l SG-do'                                     � [d£dej]   The fact that nasality, a syllable-level feature, is also copied to the reduplicant (with 'I will
eat' the grammatical output in (32) is [n::Jnow], and not *[d::Jnow]) suggests that at least the
prosodic syllable, and not just some segmental elements of it, is copied.
   An alternative account of the process of reduplication, based on a more considered
analysis of word and syllable structure in I'saka, is presented in §2.6.1.","[45, 46]"

1 16     Chapter 1 0   Almost all the tree species listed below have not been translated, due to the difficulty of
checking a tree's classification. Three trees were described by Wou Wake in Tok Pisin as
being 'smel diwai' (= a fragrant tree), and 'kalpuluw' and 'harima' (the translation of which
is unknown to us). In addition, the high number of words beginning with ti-, and su-,
probably reflecting a complex morphological composition, with ti- representing tii 'tree', and
su- representing su 'sago (tree)' .

2. 6.3 A note on contrasts and positions
    From the material in the previous sections it can be seen that monosyllables in I'saka show
the greatest number of contrasts of syllables in the language. They show a greater range of
possibilities in this regard primarily because they may include a syllable-initial cluster (e.g,
[pl'l-i ] 'bad' compared to [PV] 'arrow'), which is not possible for the syllables of polysyllabic
words.
    Additionally, the word-initial slot is the position in which consonantal segments are
maximally distinct from each other. Word-initial onsets contrast for place and manner of
articulation, as well as voicing (see examples in §2. 1 . 1 ). However, in word-medial position,
voice and manner distinctions are lost owing to intervocalic lenition. The sets of bilabial
stops (/p <1>1 and fbI), and the dentoalveolar It! and lsI, no longer contrast. It is possible that
         ,....this has led to a reanalysis of all intervocalic occurrences of [13] and [z] as Ip <1>1 and lsI
                                                                                        ,....
34    Chapter 2respectively, and may have played a role in the establishment of lsi as a distinct phoneme.
(We can speculate that the current unmotivated fluctuation between [p] and [<1>] is a
recurrence of the same phenomenon.) Alternatively, Idl maintains intervocalic contrast with
alveolar consonants through lateralisation. Thus we see onset contrast potential reduce from
ten possibilities word-initially ([p], [b], [d], [t], [s], [k], [pI] etc.) to four possibilities word­
medially (bilabial, alveolar, velar, lateral).","[51, 52]"

                                                I'saka is the language spoken in the village of Krisa. It is also spoken in the off-shoot
                                             settlement at Pasi, four hours' walk north near the coast and c loser to government
                                             administration, and also at numerous temporary bush camps about the plateau lands near
                                            Mount Asowa, which is the centre of the range of hunting and gathering for the people of
                                            Krisa village. The language is endangered in all senses of the word, inconsistently used in
                                            this one village, and sparsely used outside it. Close by in the larger population centre of
                                            Vanimo, different languages are spoken. Tok Pisin, the lingua franca of most of Papua
                                            New Guinea, has supplanted most of the traditional functions of I'saka. Nonetheless, I'saka
                                            still serves as an icon of the separateness and identity of the Krisa people (§ 1 .3 .2), and is still
                                            being passed on.
                                                This is the first linguistic documentation of the I1saka language. Laycock ( 1 973)
                                            tentatively classifies that language, which he calls Krisa , along with Rawo, Puari and
                                            Warap u (now known as Puare and Barupu), as members of the Krisa branch of the
                                            Sko phylum. In the light of more recent research this classification is not tenable: although
                                            the languages are all related to each other, as well as to the closely related languages of the
                                            coastal strip from Pasi to the Skou villages across the border into Papua, it is in a very
                                            different configuration to that proposed by Laycock (the classification that is followed here
                                            is described in § 1 . 3). Since the publication of Laycock ( 1 973), there have been occasional
                                            references in print to the position of I'saka within his classification, but no material on or
                                            references to the language have appeared, other than Donohue and San Roque (2000), and
                                            San Roque (200 1 ).
                                                The language of the people who live in Krisa village is more properly known as I'saka,
                                            the name preferred by native speakers, and also a name that is phonotactically possible in the
                                            language (see §2.6 . 1 ). In this work both terms will be used, but for different senses: the
                                            language shall be referred to as I'saka, and the people and their village as Krisa.
                                                I'saka is unusual not only in terms of general world typology, but also in terms of the
                                            characteristics we might expect from a language of New Guinea, indeed even of the Macro­
                                            Skou family in which it finds its nearest cousins. Using the characteristics of a 'typical'
                                            Papuan language that Foley ( 1 998) proposes, we find that I'saka can be accommodated into
                                            the phonological expectations for Papuan languages, but that is only because the prospect of
                                            complete allophony between voiced stops and voiced nasals was not considered by Foley (see
                                            §2.4. 1 for discussion). Asmat (Voorhoeve 1 9 65) also shows complementary and free
                                            distribution between oral stops and nasal stops; Clouse and Clouse ( 1 993) describe just such a

2     Chapter 1more likely candidates for genetic relatedness to I'saka than is Asmat or any of its relatives.
Morphologically, I'saka shows more similarities with the Melanesian Austronesian pattern
than the 'typical' Papuan pattern (that is, the highlands Trans New Guinea pattern that is
usually evoked when referring to Papuan languages), with strict word order, no case-marking
particles, and relatively simple morphology. Syntactically, I'saka is mainly right-headed at
the clause level, but left-headed within the NP, as is to be expected (Dryer 1 98 8). The
language makes extensive use of light verbs (§5.3 . 1 , 5 . 3 .2), sometimes with a semantically
specifying nominal, and sometimes without, relying on either discourse-contextual knowledge
or on shared cultural knowledge concerning the activities performed with different things to
resolve ambiguities. These points will all be examined in detail from Chapter 2 on, following
a discussion of the sociolinguistic factors that are at play in the Krisa community.","[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

                  'louse'        'butterfly'    'house'         'language'   On polysyllabic words the distinctions in tones can be very subtle. The difference between
a LH and a LR is very slight, since there is a degree of assimilation in pitch between the two
syllables, leading to a L having a slight rising off-glide when a following syllable contains a
high pitch. Given that syllables are not strictly separated by silence, and that intervocalic
consonants all ienite, which involves voicing, both a putative LH and LR will be expected to
have pitch contours something like [---] and [--I] respectively, with minimal differentiation.
They can, however, be distinguished in the speech of careful speakers when they talk slowly.
   The combinations that have been found on monomorphernic disyllabic roots can be seen in
Table 6. It is immediately apparent that less than half the theoretically possible tone patterns
(4 x 4) which might be expected on disyllabic roots are actually found. Specifically, there are
no combinations involving a falling pitch on one syllable of a word, low-low is the only
sequence of two identical tones found, and the sequence high-rise has not been observed.
   The fact that we do not find any sequences of adjacent syllables with identical marked
pitches on both syllables implies some working of the Obligatory Contour Principle, requiring
that there be a change in the parameter [pitch] from one tone-bearing unit to the next. The
admissibility of sequences of two low-pitched syllables in a row, rather than refuting this
hypothesis, implies that, rather than being a specified tone, at least some instances of
phonetic low pitch contour do in fact represent syllables that are phonologically toneless or
underspecified for a tone value. The absence of a high-rise sequence is perhaps motivated by
the difficult of rising from an already high pitch to a yet higher one. The absence of a falling
pitch in combination on disyllables is suggestive of a rule, either prohibiting a F adjacent to
                                                                                Phonology    17another tonally specified syllable in the same phonological word, or else a rule of tone sandhi
altering the F to another pitch contour. Since these are monomorphernic roots, and as such
do not show any further interaction between their syllables, these hypotheses cannot be tested.
   An alternative explanation is that tone is in fact assigned at a word level in I 'saka: the
disyllabic correlate of H is RH ; that of L, LL; that of R is both LH and LR, and the correlate
of F is both HL and RL (alternatively, and perhaps more justified, we find a new LHL
melody that cannot be realised on monosyllables, but is realised over words of two or more
syllables). This would then match the word-tone systems observed in the (distantly) related
coastal languages Skou, Puare, Leitre (Donohue 2002a) and Barupu (Crowther 2000). The
fact that the morpheme yung 'bird', which has a falling tone, is heard with a low pitch in
some compounds, such as [jilru] [- I] 'forest pigeon', supports the notion that the I'saka tone
system is word-based, not syllable-based. In the case of the word cited, we would presume
that the falling tone of yung is overwritten by a rising tone associated with the bound root ru.
See Donohue ( 1 997) for discussion of the typology of tone systems in New Guinea. Much
more data is needed before this hypothesis can be confirmed.","[34, 35]"
"
5.5.2 Possessive pronouns
   The possessive pronouns have been introduced in §4. 1 .4 and §4. l . S . Examples of
possessive pronoun are shown below. These two examples both show the possessive pronoun
inside an NP, though it is also possible for a possessive pronoun to serve as the predicate of a
clause, and be negated. See §S .7.2 for an example of this.
   (200)     Pung      dina        wu-nasu.
             y.sibling l SG.POSS 3SG.F-sit
             'My sister's sitting down.'
   (20 1 )   Wei yumu          nuo.
             house 2pL.POSS big
             'Your house is big.'
  The possessive pronouns may function as predicates as well, expressing the notions
'mine', 'yours' etc. , as well as 'my' and 'your':
   (202)     Nina        mi.
             1 SG .POSS NEG
             '(It's) not mine. '
80     Chapter 5   When alternative possession is used, such as the unmarked pronoun with the dative
suffixes (§4. 1 ), the same syntactic behaviour is observed.","[97, 98]"
"
6.6 Verb serialisation
    I ndependent verbs may be used in serial verb constructions, provided that they show
identical subject agreement, and the same specifications for polarity, aspect, etc. Serial verb
constructions are common constructions in the languages of New Guinea, and their use in
I'saka can be seen in the following example, which shows both manner-of-motion and simple
change-of-location verbs serialised together, each with their own inflection for subject,
necessarily agreeing (if there is overt agreement - the 3PL subject in (292) evokes no overt
agreement on the verbs because these verbs take no agreement prefix for 3PL).
     (29 1 )   A       nuo k-alie       k-ele ' ya.
               pig.M big 3SG.M-flee 3SG.M-go COMP
               'The big pig ran away. '
     (292)     Dakau onde akane w{ysau .
               children go hide forest
               'The children went and hid in the bush.'
   Note that this is an example in which the adjective (nuo 'big') appears adjacent to the noun
rather than after the verb, despite the fact that no peripheral argument is present. This may be
because of the presence of the completive particle, or because subject-linked adjectives
cannot follow serialised verbs. However, from (293) we can see that an object-linked
adjective may follow this sort of complex predicate. Note that in this sentence there is no
completive particle.
     (293)     Yung d-asa         d-ei kaipa.
               bird 1 SG-carry 1 SG-do one
               'I brought one bird.'
   Object suffixes (and presumably dative suffixes) need only be marked on the second verb,
as is shown in the verb series -esi 'carry' + -epa 'put' ('hold') in example ( 1 1 0), though this
may be a result of the first verb not being eligible to take the highly restricted object marking
(recall that only a small minority of verbs inflect for (non-dative) object in I'saka).
Restrictions on the compulsory sharing of irrealis inflection for serial verbs (that is, whether
one or both must be inflected) are not known.
                                                                                  Syntax       97   Some predicates appear to be expressed only by means of what is formally a serial
construction; these are described in §5.3 . l as dependent verbs.
   A maximum of two verbs in series has been attested, though logically complex events of
taking (carry, do, go) would be possible. Serial verb constructions of the type 'cause + result',
exemplified by the Tok Pisin Em i kilim man indai 'He hit the man dead' have not,
surprisingly, been noted in I 'saka, where the most commonly attested serial verb
constructions involve motion verbs serialising with either an elevational motion verb ('go up',
'go down') or a manner of motion verb ('walk ', 'run').
   (294)    Tani' dina       k-ele '     k-ung      wi'.
            father l SG.POSS 3SG.M-go 3SG.M-go.down sea
            'My father went down to the sea. '
   A range of other examples of verb serialisation can be found i n the texts i n Chapter 7.","[114, 115]"

                                                           Irregular verb paradigms         1 05   The plural of the verb 'go' is found in two forms. In addition to, for instance, yore ', the
form yinore ' has also been recorded. The meaning difference, if any, between these two
forms is not known. The similarity of the root for 'go' in I'saka to the cognate forms in Skou
(re) makes it very likely that the apparently prefixal in- has historically borne some function,
which might possibly have been lost, or else fused into the root, in the case of the 3PL form.
   It is worth pointing out that some of the verb forms described here show some degree of
mUltiple exponence of agreement marking for subject. This is particularly noticable with the
verbs of going. For example, when the 2PL form of the verb is given as yinore ', the
morphological breakdown of the verb must be something like the following:
   (303)   yinore'
           yi-n-ore'
           2PL-PL-go.PL
           'You all went.'
   The mUltiple marking of the same features, or subsets of the same set of features, at
different points in a verb is common to other members of the Skou family (though it is by no
means universal). I t has been described in Skou (Donohue 1 999b) and Barupu (Donohue
2003), and has also been observed, with pragmatic functions, in Puare (Donohue's
fieldnotes, 2002).
9            Comparison with related
             languages    As mentioned in § 1 . 3 , there are no languages with a particularly close linguistic
relationship to I'saka. Despite this lack of near siblings, I'saka is demonstrably a member of
the Macro-Skou family, as has been seen in Figure 3, and numerous cognates and
paradigmatic matches can be found with languages in other, more populous, branches of this
family (see Donohue 2002a, to appear). In this section some of the similarities between
I'saka and various of the other languages of the family will be described.
    Recall from Figure 3 in § 1 . 3 that I'saka is a first-order subgroup within the Macro-Skou
family. As such, there are not many cognates with any one language from the other branch
of Macro-Skou, but taken as a whole there are quite a few. Table 30 presents a non­
exhaustive list of representative examples, with the non-I'saka words shown in IPA .","[122, 123, 124]"
"
6.1 Word order   rsaka clauses and phrases exhibit a quite strict word order, though there are pragmatic
alternatives for many constructions. This section starts with an overview of clausal word
order, and then proceeds into noun phrases. This order of presentation has been chosen to
follow the possibilities for adjectives, which can in many instances appear outside the NP of
the noun they modify.",[103]
"
5.3.3 Verbs of location
   One further prominent class of verbs shall be mentioned. These are the verbs of location
of inanimate things, such as 'be at ', and they are illustrated below. The verb of the first
example, siakai, is commonly used for moveable objects, whereas ta in ( 1 68) and ( 1 69) is
usually used to describe the location of less mobile items.
   ( 1 67)   6   siakai ti'.
             pot be.at fire
             'The pot is on the fire.'
   ( 1 68)   Wei   dina        ta    Aliakaw.
             house l SG.POSS be.at Aliakau
             'My house is in Aliakau. '
   ( 1 69)   Tarie ta      yang mi.
             ear     be.at leg NEG
             '(Your) ear isn't located on (your) leg.'
   ( 1 70)   *nana siakai wei
              1 SG be.at house
             'I'm at home.'
   These words represent something of a conundrum for morphological analysis, as it is
impossible to tell with certainty whether or not they are inflected for subject. Inanimates
normally take 3SG.NM inflection on verbs, but the inflection for 3SG.NM on many verbs is
irregular (see §5 .2.2 and Chapter 8). The fact that these verbs of location begin with [t] and
74       Chapter 5[s] (which are probably etymologically related - see §2.3 .4) is suggestive of productive
inflection for 3SG.NM, at least historically. This is because a large proportion of verbs with
suppletive 3SG.NM forms are t-initial for 3SG.NM (e.g. tu 3SG.NM come).
    Occurrences of the verb siakai such as that in ( 1 67) do not show variation for number, as
is illustrated by the following sentence, which has a plural subject:
     (1 71)    Tei     amopa ni'           siaka lu      wei  tru.
               wood many INTENSE be.at be.at house inside
               'There's a lot of firewood inside the house. '
   Unlike inanimate things, animate subjects are 'located' using postural verbs that
incorporate information about the stance or orientation of the object, such as -ana 'sit', -ung
'be at', etc. (see below). Given this distinction in the verbs, the verbs exemplified above are
perhaps inherently inanimate, rendering subject inflection irrelevant.
   There are some instances of the dative suffix occurring on location verbs. In these cases it
encodes the possessor of the sole argument of the verb:
     ( 1 72)   Kap dina-e              sakai-na   wei.
               cup 1 SG.POSS-EMPH be.at- 1 SG.DAT house
               'My cup is in the (?my) house. '
     ( 1 73)   6 sakai-na.
               pot be.at- 1 SG.DAT
                'That's my pot.'
               (or possibly: 'My pot is there.')
   Examples of this can be found in the following paradigms and sentences, showing
different verbs being used with different nouns, depending on their relation to a human-style
stance or posture. The unmarked verb collocation used to indicate existing for humans, lada!
+ lui 'sit + be.at', inflects as follows (shown with the unmarked pronominal set):     ( 1 74)   nana n-ana n-u            nesing si-na su   numu ni-na ku
               mama m-ana m-u            lsang s-ana su    yumu yi-na ku
               kie k-ana k-ung           esang s-ana su    ia ina ku/ana ku
               omu (w)ona su
   It is not the case that different kinds of inanimate nouns are found with the postural verbs,
with the choice of verb acting as a covert classification system (as is seen commonly in other
Papuan languages, e.g. Enga: Lang 1 975). Rather, in I'saka, the postural verbs are used only
to show actual postural alignment for animate arguments that are capable of assuming
different postures, and inanimate arguments, rather than utilising these postural verbs as a
form of classification, simply employ a separate set of verbs. In a sense, then, there is a
classification of nomina Is into animate versus inanimate, but it does not go beyond this. The
one exception involves villages, which are coded as if they were animate, as the following
example shows:
     ( 1 75)   I 'saka        ana ku      i 'tanu.
               Krisa.village sit be.at mountain
               'Krisa village is on the mountain. '
  Here I'saka occurs not with siaka , the verb used to code a n inanimate argument's location.
Despite this ana is not inflected for person or number.
                                                                                 Morphology   755.4 Further verbal morphosyntax   The previous sections have presented the regular, mono-predicative morphosyntax of
verbs, with some complications in the use of dependent verbs. In this section we shall discuss
valency-affecting operations such as causation and various means of valency reduction.","[91, 92, 93]"
"
5.2.5 Reduplication: Irrealis   Verbs can be marked as irrealis through reduplication of the first syllable of the subject­
inflected verb. Discussion of the mechanism of reduplication and the interesting allophony
that is entails can be found in §2.4.2 and §2.6. 1 .
   ( 1 53)    Bala         d-ele'-le'.
              tomorrow 1 SG-go-<IRR>
              'I 'll go tomorrow. '
   ( 1 54)    Tau d-ei,      a        k-a-ka-(a)li.
              noise l sG-do pig.M 3SG.M-run.away-<IRR>
              'If I make a noise, the pig will run away.'
   A further verbal suffix -re 'evident' is also found (see also §5.2 . 1 ). I n most contexts, it
expresses temporal immediacy, as in:
   (1 55)     Pi       k-ei-re.
              rain.M 3SG.M-do-EVID
              'It's raining now.'
    However, there are other examples in which the suffix encodes more than just temporal
information. For example, its presence on the verb epe 'put, throw' expresses that something
is not only thrown, but also hits a target (the evident result of having been thrown). Another
nice example of the use of this morpheme for effect is seen below (note that on dakaiung the
vowel appears as a, not e).
   (1 56)     Nana d-akai-ung-ra             bupu bima,      tu
              I SG 1 SG-wait-3sG.NM.DAT-EVID sister 2SG.POSS 3SG.NM .come
70      Chapter 5               mou-re.
               not.exist-EVID
               '(Well,) I 've been waiting for your sister, as you can see, and she (still)
               hasn't come, obviously. '
   A lthough the irrealis and evidential morphemes are typologically distinct (the former
being reduplicative) and do not show regular alternation, it is assumed that they are mutually
exclusive as their semantic domains overlap and conflict to a considerable extent.","[87, 88]"

The location of Krisa and Pasi with respect to the local provincial capital of Vanimo, and the
closer town of Ossima in the Pual river basin, is shown in Figure 1 . The villages north of the
Oenake range represent those that speak languages related to I 'saka in the (smaller) Skou
family, from Skou Mabo in the west through to Vanimo. Between the Bewani mountains and
this range, along the course of the Pual river, are the languages of the Bewani (Border
languages) group, unrelated to the Skou languages. In the Bewani mountains to the southeast
are some northern hamlets of Fas-speaking peoples such as Yo, relatives of whom have
spilled over into the Serra Hills in the last few decades, but these areas remain sparsely
populated.",[20]

2.7 Orthography    The segments and supra segmental features of I'saka are written in the rest of this sketch
in an orthography that matches that used in trial literacy materials in the village. It represents
all phonological contrasts, though not always in the same way - that is, there is not a 1 : 1
correspondence between graphemes and phonological units.
   The proposed I'saka orthography, which is used in all examples here, was developed by
M ark Donohue and Lila San Roque, and is largely an adaptation of the Tok Pisin
orthography to local phonology and preference (see San Roque 200 1 for a more detailed
discussion of the issues involved in the orthographies of tonal languages in New Guinea).
Finding appropriate orthographic collaborators in Krisa was difficult. It was not possible to
work extensively with the school as two of the teachers were not I'saka speakers, as has
already been mentioned. Older speakers (the I'saka authorities) had less developed literacy
skills than were necessary (given the time available) or else were so dogmatic about their
orthographic choices that it was rather risky asking their opinions. Younger people were not
comfortable making decisions concerning the language, as they felt it was not their place to
do so. There was thus no consistent and definitive group of Krisa people who assisted with
the orthography's development. Speaker consultation was informal and varied.",[52]
