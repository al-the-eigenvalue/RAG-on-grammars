"    The fourth chapter, with a question whether Nihali is an Isolate,
the answer being that it is an isolate. Here this speech form has been
compared with Korku, which being very close to it physically as
well as most of the speakers are bilingual in it. As no other language
has any chance of being comparable as they are very different from
it, and Korku’s influence on it is most significant; an attempt has
been made in this chapter to compare them taking various aspects
and prove that it is not in any way connected to Korku. Also a list of
so-called two hundred basic wordlist has been provided for both the
languages. In addition, comparable wordlist has been provided
from Mundari, a close relative of Korku, which will serve the
purpose of indicating the relationship with Korku. This hopefully
supports the claim that Nihali is not related to Munda languages. No
attempt has been made to identify whether each comparable set is
native or borrowed. It has been left for the readers’ judgment to
decide on the closeness.",[16]
"4.2.5. Interrogative forms: The interrogative forms in Nihali are
the following- nan 'what', nani 'who', naway 'why', nava:san 'why';
meran 'when', minga:y 'where', m(i)yan 'how much'. It appears that
basically there are two interrogative bases, made of na- and mV-. By
suffixing -n to the first base, a form 'questioning thing' is obtained;
by suffixing -i to the base of nan, a form 'questioning a person' is
obtained; by suffixing -ay to the base of na-, a form ‘questioning
reason' is obtained. By suffixing -san to the interrogative form
‘questioning reason’, a form 'questioning why' is obtained.
(Alternatively, na- base may be considered to be nan instead; then it
itself 'questions thing', etc.). By suffixing -ga:y to the base (mV-), a
form 'questioning location' is obtained, and by suffixing (y)an to the
same base a form 'questioning quantity' is obtained.",[149]
"3.4.3. Interrogative forms*: The interrogative forms in this speech
form are the following- na:n 'what', nani 'who', naway 'why',
nawa:san 'how, why'; mi- ‘which’, meran 'when', minga:y 'where',
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                39m(i)yan 'how much'. From this list it appears that basically there are
two interrogative bases, made of na- and mV-. By suffixing -n to the
first base, a form 'questioning inanimate object' is obtained; by
suffixing -i to the base of nan-, a form 'questioning an animate
object' is obtained; by suffixing -ay to the base of na-, a form* In this and the following section no distinction is made between
‘pronouns’ and ‘others’.‘questioning reason' is obtained. By suffixing -san to the
interrogative form ‘questioning reason’, a form 'questioning why' is
obtained. (Alternatively, the base may be considered to be nan
instead of na-; then it itself 'questions inanimate object', etc.). By
suffixing -ga:y to the base (mV-), a form 'questioning location' is
obtained, and by suffixing -(y)an to the same base a form
'questioning quantity' is obtained. Interrogative forms can either
occur at the beginning of the sentence or immediately after the
subject or at the end of a sentence depending upon the nature of the
question, as will be clear from below. So, they can take some case
markers, like nominative (zero), objective, dative, etc. A few
illustrations are provided below.:na- : na:n 'what': It can be placed either at the beginning of the
sentence or at the end, depending upon the nature of the question.(32)(a) Q. uṭan nan ‘what (is) that?’

                  Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION   The term nahal in the Nihali/Nahali language means ‘tiger’ or
‘lion’. Russel and Hiralal (1916) describe the Nahal or Nihal as a
hybrid of the Bhil and Korku. They were also identified with an
ancient community, called Nahalka, mentioned in Padma Purana as
an offshoot of the Nishada. The Nahals are subdivided into
Raghuvanshi and Tavadia sections. The Korku, who first migrated
to the Berar region of Madhya Pradesh, found the Nahal in
possession of the hills. Gradually, the Nahals lost their land. They
are notified under the nomenclature Nihal/Nahul as a scheduled
tribe, and are grouped along with the Korku, Bopchi, Mouasai,
Bondhi and Bondeya. At present, the Nahals of this area speak
Nimari, an Indo-Aryan language. However, in some places like
Buldhana district of Maharashtra, Nahals speak their own language,
which is highly influenced by Korku and other languages. The
Nahals are further divided into a number of totemic clans (nata).
Monogamy is the norm. They mainly subsist on agriculture labour.
They are mostly employed as labourers in agricultural fields by
other communities. (From K.S.Singh’s People of India book)   Nihali, also Nahali, had 3600 speakers according to 1961 census
of India reports. The speakers are found in an area of about fifty
square miles in the northern extremes of Buldhana district of
Maharashtra. Though Nihals are found in Amravati district of
Maharashtra and East Nimar district of Madhya Pradesh, in the
foothills of the western-most range of the Satpuda mountains they
no longer speak their own speech form. According to the available
information there are no monolingual adult Nihals. Only two brief
descriptive articles have appeared on this language so far.
However, comparative studies have been somewhat richer, since the
genetic relation of Nihali is a matter of dispute. Konow believed
the language to be Munda, with heavy Dravidian and Indo-Aryan
2                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyaccretion. But even the Munda element consists largely of Korku
loans, and in 1941 R.Shafer proposed that Nahali represents an
altogether separate stock. F.B.J. Kuiper has shown that over 20
percent of the available vocabulary of Nahali is unrelated to that of
any Indian linguistic family. The present study corroborates with
this view.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"   The most affected area is the Nihali phonology. The present
structure is such that it almost has become bland, and so similar to
other families of the area in many structural aspects. It was
indicated in the previous sections that vowel length and aspiration
are secondary; so their presence can be directly attributable to IA
languages. Similarly the retroflex series is very unstable, indicating
the possibility of it being non-native. Though at present these
speakers live away from the Dravidian communities like Gondi or
Kolami; probably they must have had some contact with them for
some considerable time before. Of course it is also possible that
130                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysome of these features might have entered through the neighbouring
and alternate (Munda) language, particularly Korku. As most Nihals
live in close proximity to Korkus, and most of them are bilinguals in
Korku this is very likely.
4.1. The vowel system is simple, almost in line with Munda
languages like Korku. The morphemes are predominantly open
(vowel ending); seldom have initial or final consonant clusters. The
syllabic structure is mainly of CVCV type.
   There are no unusual features which can be considered to be
peculiar to this language. So, no checked sounds which are found in
Munda languages (even though Korku has lost this feature). Lexical
items are quite different from Korku or any other language; even
though some losses can be observed. Pronouns, demonstratives,
interrogatives, negatives, tense, aspect markers are all different as
compared to other languages. A list of two-hundred common words
has been given at the end of this section comparing Korku forms.
This will provide important lexical differences.","[140, 141]"
"  The third section provides listing of total vocabulary collected
with glosses in English and also with remarks wherever possible.
No serious attempt has been made to identify each and every
borrowed item.

                          PHONOLOGY2.1. Phonemic InventoryThe phonetic inventory of Nihali is as follows:
Vowels:                 Front            Back
                 i i:             u u:
                 e e:             o o:
                                  a a:i.e., i, e, a, o, u; plus [:]. The vowels [e] and [o] seem to have lower
varieties at morpheme final positions at least at the phonetic level.
In addition to these, [∂] seems to be present, phonetically.","[16, 17, 18]"
"3.7.6. Negative forms: Negation is marked by various forms; some
occur preceding the verbal root, some following it. The negative
markers (forms) are the following: beṭhe, ho:ṭo, biji, hayom, and
bikhil. The last one is not frequently used. Probably it may be a
variant of beṭhe. In negative constructions all the tenses are not
marked. Among these negatives, while biji marks negative
imperativeness; beṭhe is used in non-past constructions; ho:ṭo is
used in past tense only; and hayom is used only in constructions
which express a sense of unfulfilled expectations.
A set may be provided as a sample.:
76                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(112) a:pa ‘to weep’: a:pa biji ‘don’t weep’ (imp.)
                      a:pa beṭhe ‘does/will not weep’
                      ho:ṭo a:pa ‘did not weep’.beṭhe: Used in non-past constructions. It can either occur preceding
or following the verb stem. Normally it precedes the verb in a
sentence; but it can occur after a verb as well, when the verb is of
predicate adjective type or equational type, etc.:beṭhe occurring before a verb:
(113)(a) jo beṭhe ha:goken
         I neg laugh-pr
         ‘I do not laugh’.     (b) nanika         beṭhe pa:ṭo
          anyone/someone neg come
          ‘no one comes’.
       vs. nanika pa:ṭoka ‘someone comes/ will come’   When this negative form occurs before a verb, often it comes
under assimilatory influences with the following verb. First of all,
the second syllable of beṭhe gets dropped; and the first consonant of
the verb gets geminated. It may be noted that it is optional, as it does
not happen always.(114)(a) kyamp jo beppa:ṭo
         tomorrow I not come –pr
         ‘tomorrow I will not come’

           ‘there is no water in the river’   In the last instance above, a bound form –la has been added to the
negative form. But it’s function if any other than emphasis, is not
clear.","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90]"
"In the following ḍa:n is used as an aspectual marker with imne :    (e) eṭla a:wa:rki imne-ḍa:n
        they house-at be-pp
        ‘they had been at home’    (f) a:wa:rminja:r-minja:r-ki biḍi kuyi imne-ḍa:n

        ‘in the middle of the house there used to be a well’.
64                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyThere is another verb, a borrowed one, used for the verb ‘be’ hey,
very restrictively, in present tense in negative formation only. For
instance:
(86)(a) eṭey a:wa:rki hey-beṭhe
          he house-at be-neg
          ‘he is not at home’     (b) eṭey hinki hey beṭhe ḍa:n
         he here-at be –neg-pp
         ‘he was not here’     (c) parayki joppo hey-beṭhe
         river-in water be-neg
         ‘there is no water in the river’   As can be seen from the illustrations above, hey is used in
negative constructions with the negative form beṭhe. The positive
construction would be: parayki joppo imni ‘(there) is water in the
river’.jere(y) ‘happen’ is used as a regular verb to convert an active
sentence into an impersonal one. For instance:(87)(a) hiṭkella minja:rki tagojagṛa jerey
        they-between-obj quarrel happen
        ‘between them quarrel happened’     (b) uku:n ba:y a:ra kya:m a:ra uṭhwã-uṭhwã

         [be- < beṭhe : loss of second syllable, + assimilation]   A few verbs have varying forms between their imperative form
and in different tenses. For instance, the verb e:r- ‘to go’, in its

"3.7.5. Moods: Modal distinctions are very few in this speech
variety. There are only indicative mood, which is unmarked,
imperative mood, marked by –be, in positive construction, and biji
in negative construction; and interrogative mood. As interrogative
74                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularywords occur very close to the verb in a construction, it has been
considered as a modal distinction. Still, it has been treated
separately. So, except for these three moods, no finer distinctions
are available.(i). Imperative verbal construction is marked by the suffix –be added
to the bare verb root.(107)(a) ne pejko-be ‘you run’
         laja-hela pejko-be ‘you all run’
         laja-hela me:r-be ‘you all play’     (b) ne eṭen pejakkama-be

          him-to tea give-to
          ‘give him tea’      (e) Sometimes without the marker as well, it is possible to
convey imperativeness. For instance, ne eṛe ‘you go’ (sg.) (> ne:ṛe).
Here the imperative marker is not used. Still it conveys a sense of
imperativity.","[84, 85]"
"    The grammatical analysis and description are carried out within the model
of modern American Structural linguistics. Establishment of functional
sounds, their contrasts, distribution and allophones together with syllable
structure form the description of phonology. The term grammar comprises the
                                       iv
traditional morphology as well as syntax with convincing examples drawn
from elicited data and texts. Under noun morphology person, number, gender
and case are detailed together with pronouns and numerals. The morphosyntax
of verb-structure reveals the unique structural patterns of Nihali. The original
analysis is supported by nearly 250 phrases, clauses and sentences, each point
dwelling and dealing with structural nuances. Dr.Nagaraja’s Nihali Language:
Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary is a landmark of his years of linguistic
fieldwork on different minor, neglected and tribal languages. He has firsthand
experience of working on Austroasiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Dravidian group
of languages. One may recall his earlier grammatical treatises on Khasi, Korku
and Konyak together with texts and multilingual dictionaries.","[4, 5]"
"    In the above constructions each positive construction has been
provided with the negative counterpart as well. It will be seen that in
many tenses not only the same negative form is used (except in past
tense); but even tense markers are not used in all negative
constructions (c, d, e above).
(93) Another paradigm: ie:r ~ e:r ‘to go’:
        ne eṛe ‘you go’(imp.)
        jo e:r-ka ‘I go’
        jo e:r-ken ‘I will go’
        jo e:r-kena ‘I will go’ (same as above)

future. While the present tense is –ka, past tense is marked by –i;
and the future tense marker is –ken. In present tense –ka is used.

        book to me’)
       -ka is used as a present tense marker and as definiteness

QUANT+N (inanimate): Here the plural marker is not used.:
     (b) kho:bo ca:go ‘plenty/many stone(s)’   In case of noun a:wa:r ‘house’ holds a special position. It can
also mean ‘home’/ ‘family’, so it can take hiṭkel, as in the following:(189)      i:r-a:wa:r hiṭkel ‘two houses’ (= members of two houses)
           kho:bo a:wa:r ‘many houses’
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                              111         kho:bo a:wa:r he:la ‘all of many houses’
         he:la gives ‘inclusive sense of family’. So, it is used with
         animate nouns. Similarly:(190)    bidi bakko ‘one hand’
         i:r bakko hiṭkel ‘two hands-both’
         kho:bo bakko ‘many hands’
         kho:bo bakko he:la ‘many hands - people’Possessive constructions: Here also the structure is: Pos.+N:(191) enge pa:lso           ‘my child’
      enge pirjo pa:lso
      my female child       ‘my female child’  The following NP consists of a possessive phrase at the
beginning followed by another NP containing demonstratives.:(192) enge-a:wa:r iṭi-a:ḍḍo uṭi-dha:r-ki (iṭi-a:ḍḍo uṭi-dha:r ‘that
      tree’s that side’)
      my house that tree that side-of
      ‘my house (is) that tree’s that side’   Two Noun Phrases can occur in a sequence in coordinate
relation, connected by the connector ḍo ‘and’:(193) biḍi-bakko-ki lakri ḍo biḍi-bakko-ki kanḍil…
      one hand-in stick and one hand –in lantern…
      ‘a stick in one hand and a lantern in another hand…’   Oppositive NPs can contain two NPs in opposition. Here is an
instance of the same. In this phrase enge bakkoka kha:na pi:na and
another NP acca-acca pakwa:n are in opposition. The first NP is a
possessive construction, ‘my hand’s food (= eating-drinking)’. The
112                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysecond part qualifies the first part. It is in opposition to the second
NP acca-acca pakwa:n ‘good-good food’.(194)    enge bakkoka kha:na pi:na acca-acca pakwa:n…
         my hand-s    food drink good-good eatables…
         ‘my hand’s food drink good-good delicious items…’3.12.3. Verb phrases: These are made up a main verb, being
obligatorily present and preceded by either an adverbial
construction and or an object. A few illustrations can be provided
here. The first is an imperative construction, where both the subject
and second person are absent, and supposed to be covertly present.
Interestingly it contains an adverbial element as first member, jaldi
‘quickly’, followed by an indirect object, basel he:la:ki ‘to the
children’, and an object, beḍe-beḍe mitha:yi ‘one-one sweet’, and
finally the verb, in imperative formation, be:-ki ‘give’.(195)     jaldi basel he:la-ki beḍe-beḍe mitha:yi be:ki
          quickly child-all-to one-one sweet-obj give-imp.
          'Give quickly one-one sweet to all the children'   In the next two illustrations, the adverbial elements occur after
the subject NP, and followed by the main verb.(196)(a) jo seko:n minḍi ḍecco celom-na kappi
         I yesterday night 10 o’clock-at sleep-pt

          I daily      work –obj go-npt
          'I go to work daily'   In the following construction, the subject (NP) is a personal
pronoun jo ‘I’, or ne ‘you’(sg.); followed by the verbal complex
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                               113containing the object backaren ‘children’ in (a), and hi-ka:mo ‘this
work’ in (b), followed by the transitive verbs in past tense, in (a)
and non-past tense in (b).(197)(a) jo backa-ren anglujkamay
         I    baby-obj bathe-make
        'I bathed the baby'.     (b) ne hi-ka:mo kama:ken
         you this-work do-can
         ‘You can do this work’In the following two instances, the NP is more fuller in structure. In
(a), it is made up of a possessive construction, dharamra:ja-na orari
‘dharamraja’s wedding’ followed by the verbal structure. Similarly,
in (b) the NP is made up of the plural demonstrative hiṭkel taking a
postposition minja:r ‘middle’, to obtain hiṭkella minja:r ‘between
them’; followed by the object, tago-jagṛa ‘quarrel/fight’, and the
verb of happening, jere- in past tense.(198)(a) dharamra:ja-na orari     jerey-ḍa:n
        dharmaraja-pos wedding happen-perf
        'Dharamraja's marriage had taken place'    (b) hiṭkella minja:rki tago-jagṛa jerey
        both between-to      fight happen-pt
        ‘they both fought with each other’   The above illustrations provide some insight into the internal
structures of sentences. They also reveal the place of adverbials
when they occur. In the following, various types of sentences both
from the nature of the verb, and from the complexity will be
discussed. In this process it is hoped that some more insights will be
available as far as the language structure is concerned.

3.12.4. Types of sentences:(a) Existential sentences:
These sentences will have the main verb of ‘to be’ type. But in
negative constructions, as in (c) below, the verb for be is imne/imni
is used in positive constructions; while in negative constructions hey
+ beṭhe ‘negative form’ is used.(199)(a) a:wa:r-sammaki mandir ḍa:n
         house-front-in     temple is
         ‘there is a temple in front of the house’      (b)   biya-kon paslaki para:y ḍa:n
             village-of behind-to river is
             ‘there is a river behind the village’      (c)   paray-ki joppo imni/e
            river-in water be
            ‘there is water in the river’ vs.            paray-ki joppo hey beṭhe:la
            river-in water be neg
            ‘there is no water in the river’(b) Identificational sentences:
In this type of constructions no verb is overtly used. Placement of
two NPs sequentially makes a sentence. Here also it is possible to
obtain negative constructions using the negative form beṭhe. For
instance,
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                 115(200)(a) jo / do:ktar ‘I (am) a doctor’ vs. jo / do:ktar beṭhe ‘I

     (b) iṭiko:l / guruji ‘that woman (is) teacher’ vs.
          iṭiko:l / guruji/ beṭhe ‘that woman (is) not teacher’
      (c) iṭimanso / korku ‘that man (is) Korku’
      (d) herey / banjara ‘this (person) (is) a banjara’, etc.
      (d) eṭey enge dusman beṭhe ‘he (is) not my enemy’
      (e) eṭey nani ‘who (is) he?’ vs. eṭey ḍa:kṭar ‘he (is) a doctor’
      (f) uṭan na:n ‘what (is) that?’ vs. uṭan ka:kado ‘that (is) a
          paper’(c) Attributive sentences:
This type of sentence also does not take a verb/copula. Here the
attribute of the subject will follow the subject concerned. The result
is a complete sentence. Here also it is possible to obtain negative
constructions by adding negative form beṭhe, as shown below.(201)(a)   hi manso / masto        vs. hi-manso masto beṭhe
           this man good               this-man good-neg
           ‘this man (is) good’        ‘this man (is) not good’      (b) eṭlan a:wa:r/ mera:ki
          his house near-to
          ‘his house (is) near’     (c)   engen a:wa:r/ backa
           my house small
           ‘my house (is) small’     (d)   hi a:ḍḍo / bha:ga lamba
           this tree very long
           ‘this tree (is) very long’      (e) ne /nu-san ‘how (are) you?’ vs. jo masto ‘I (am) fine’
116                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(d) Possessive sentences:
In this type also except for verb imni(c)/imri(c) ‘be’, and ṭha:k- ‘to
have’ type; no other verb is used. Placement of two NPs
sequentially makes a sentence. Here also the negative constructions
can be obtained by using the negative form beṭhe, as shown below.
For instance:(202)(a) a:ḍḍo-ki phu:l imric
          tree-in flower be-np
         ‘the tree has flower’      (b) eṭey gida:r janwarṭa ṭha:ki
          he many animals have-np
          ‘he has many animals’.(203)(a)   ra:m-ki / biḍi-ka bakko
           ram-to one-only hand
           ‘ram (has) one-only hand’       (b) dho:r-ki/ na:lku khuri
           cow-to        four leg
           ‘cow (has) four legs’      (b) a:ṭo-ki / i:rbakko biḍi peñ
          man-to / two hand one head
          ‘man has two hands one head’.      (c) a:wa:rki / biḍi-bi da:na hey beṭhe
          house-at one-even grain be neg
          ‘at home not even a grain is’      (d) ha:n / nanin a:wa:r ‘this whose house ?’ vs. ha:n /enge
          a:wa:r ‘this my house’.
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                              117(e) Interrogative sentences: In this type, the interrogative forms
occur at the end of the sentence. For instance:(204)     ne jumu na:n
          your name what
          ‘What is your name?’
         (See Interrogatives section for details)(f) Negative sentences have been amply illustrated in sec. 3.7.6.
So, they are not discussed here.","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128]"
"    Nihali texts represent the narratives dealing with several aspects of tribal
life including the traditional knowledge, life style, equality of persons, joy and
sorrow of the people and their philosophy of life. The texts are represented in
phonetic transcription, rather than transliteration, to preserve the spoken style
of the narratives. Each sentence is numbered, with word-to-word meaning and
free translation into English. Nihali lexical items are given in the English
alphabetical order with their meanings on the left side and the source of
borrowing, if any, on the right (in a three-column arrangement).
    Nihali was identified as a separate speech in the mid 1950s by the late
Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya and after a lapse of nearly six decades, the present
volume is the first original detailed study of this endangered language isolate.
It will be of great interest to the students and scholars of Linguistics,
Anthropology, Folklore, Lexicography, Education and Language Planning.

unceasing seminal linguistic fieldwork and language analysis, with untiring
commitment.",[5]

them, they become definite.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]"

varieties of Marathi/Hindi as well. Most Nihals are landless
labourers, so economically very poor. Because of it, they come in
contact with other language speakers for their own survival. As their
number is quite small, education, which is very recent, has to be
imparted to them through other languages. So, their language has
been influenced very much by Korku and to some extent by other
Chapter 1/ Introduction                                             3languages. Since 1998 yearly some data has been collected on the
language spoken in Buldhana district of north Maharashtra by the
present writer. So far all the villages where Nihals live and speak
the language have been covered. Based on the data, a preliminary
phonemic analysis and a tentative grammatical sketch have been
prepared.
Statistical and Geographical data   Nihali speaking people live in the following villages: Jamod,
Sonbardi, Kuvardev, Chalthana, Ambavara, Wasali and Cicari - all
in Buldhana district and also fairly close to each other. It has been
observed that a few dialectal differences, particularly in the lexicon
have been observed between Kuvardev-Chaltana varieties vs.
Jamod-Sonbardi varieties. Elsewhere not much of variation is found
between these speech forms. In the following description general
features of Nihali language will be discussed.","[13, 14]"

                           GRAMMAR3.0. General remarks: Nihali’s word structure shows agglutinative
character; but it is simple. Not too many affixes get joined to a base
form. The roots of the language are primarily disyllabic with vowel
ending, though some consonant ending roots are possible. The
common canonical structure of a root is- CVC(C)V(C).
Morphological processes employed in this language are: affixation
(generally suffixation only (but potentially also infixation among
demonstratives only), compounding and reduplication.","[37, 38]"
"Present continuous construction is marked by suffixing –kini to the
verb root form of the verb. :

         ceki-kin-ḍa:n ‘was/is about to be caught’Past continuous construction (indefinite) is formed by suffixing
ḍa:n to the non-past verbal base.:
(105)     kappo-ka-ḍa:n ‘would sleep’
          kappo-kini-ḍa:n ‘was sleeping’Past perfect construction is obtained by adding –ḍa:n to the past
construction.:

          …leg      size swell-ed
          ‘(finger) had swelled to the leg-size’   In the negative formations, two negative forms, beṭhe and ho:ṭo
are used. While the first one is used in non-past constructions, the
second one is used in past constructions. However this distinction is
not always followed. Also, frequently the negative marker precedes
the verb; while it may even follow the verb in a construction. (For
more details see 3.7.6.).","[83, 84]"
"Three member consonant sequences: The following list provides
available three-member consonant sequences. As will be observed,
majority of them involve (a) a glide, either as first member, which is
quite rare (found only in two combinations); or mostly as third (last)
member; and (b) involve other consonants, which are limited to the
following combinations: -mpl-, mbr-, -mpṭ-, -ncr-, -nṭl-, -ndr-, -
nḍp-, -ngr-, -ngl-, -rkt-. In (a) only two examples contain the palatal

24                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyglide in the initial position; while in all others the glides occur as
final member. Also, between the two glides available in the final
position, the palatal glide is much more frequent than the bilabial
glide (only one instance). Further in all the examples the glides
occur preceding the low open vowel. Interestingly in (b), the first
member is mostly an alveolar nasal –n-; or the trill –r-; while in the
second position only a stop sound can occur; and in final position
more variety is possible; though conspicuously nasal sound is
missing.(a)    -ply- koplya ‘hoe’
       -phry- pephrya ‘eagle’, ‘saliva’
       -bry- jebrya ‘molar teeth/jaw’

        -ngl-   anglujbe ‘to bathe’
        -rkt-   murktij ‘a variety of small mosquito’   There are only three four-member consonant sequences are
found. Interestingly all of them have only voiced sounds. Also the
first member belongs to a liquid sound, and a glide in the fourth
(last) position. They are listed below.:        -mbry- ṭembrya ‘tiger’
        -ngry- mangrya ‘people who beat drums’
        -rmby- tormbya ‘fruit of mahua tree’.","[34, 35, 36]"
"   In this speech form adjectives are not derived as such. However,
negative form beṭhe can be used as a prefix with some of the
adjectives to obtain negative adjectives. Interestingly here only a
prefix is used in this way. Some examples will make it clear.:(152) bhum ‘sharp’(e.g.knife) vs. bebhum ‘dull’(knife)
      nitto ‘sharp’(e.g.knife) vs. benitto ‘blunt’ (knife)
      ho:si ‘consiousness’     vs. beho:si ‘unconsciousness’
      diso ‘visible’           vs. beddiso ‘not visible’
      ḍhang ‘proper’           vs. beḍhang ‘useless’.",[105]
"   From the above paradigm many aspects of verbal structure
becomes clear and it can be seen that sentences end in verbal
constructions. First of all, the word order is Subject-Verb in an
intransitive sentence. Here, the verb kap- ‘to sleep’ occurs after the
subject jo ‘I’. In a negative sentence, the negative marker normally
occurs preceding the verb. The verbal structure does not show any
68                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyform of agreement with the rest of the sentence. The verbal
structure is pretty simple. The verbal construction carries tense
marker, aspect and mood markers in 'word' structure. The t/a/m
markers follow the verb base.
   In a NP, adjective precedes the Noun. Similarly adverbs precede
the verb. Unlike other language families of the area, there is no
agreement in this language.","[78, 79]"
"Also, sometimes another negative form from Hindi (?) bigar
‘without’ is used.:(116)      bigar joppoki nawki ji:wta:ken
           ‘Without water how (one) will live ?’ho:ṭo: In past tense ho:to ~ ho:ṭo is used to mark negation. So no
separate tense marker is used. It always precedes the verb. In the
process, the final vowel of it gets dropped in some cases, and in
some cases the second consonant of it undergoes assimilation
(which is optional) to the consonant of the next word.(117)(a)    ho:ṭo-kappo 'did not sleep' (kappo ‘to sleep’),     (b)    se ra:m a:wa:r-ke pa:ṭi/ho:ṭpa:ṭo (without assimilation)
            yesterday Ram house-to come-pt /not come-np
            ‘Yesterday Ram came home/ did not come home’   As can be seen above, in negative construction no tense marker is
used, while in positive construction tense marker is required. But it
can take aspectual marker -ḍa:n.(118)(a)    jo nene ma:nḍi ho:ṭcakni
            I your word not listen

           ‘I had not laughed’.     (d)   aju nallika ho:to pa:ṭo

           I station-to go-pt me-to vehicle neg. get
           'I had gone to the station, I did not get the vehicle', etc.","[90, 91]"
"4.2.8. Negative forms: Negation is marked by various forms; some
preceding the verbal root, some following it. In negative
constructions all the tenses are not marked: In non-past and past
tenses ho:to is used to mark negation. It can occur preceding or
following the verb.           ho:to-kappo 'does not/did not sleep', (kappo ‘to sleep’),           jo istan-ki e:riḍa:n engki ga:ḍi ho:to ghaṭa-jere
           I station-to go-pt me-to vehicle neg. get-happen
           'I had gone to the station, I did not get the vehicle', etc.",[152]
"2.4. Distribution of phonemes
In this study no attempt has been made to segregate native vs.
borrowed vocabulary, as it is very difficult to do so, particularly
between Nihali vs. Korku. Obviously many of the contrasts above
and many of the consonant sequences below involve data belonging
to other than Nihali itself. This feature needs to be kept in mind.",[26]
"  In the following set the first demonstrative adjective iṭi marks
remote visible while the second uṭi marks remote-non-visible.:              enge a:wa:r iṭi a:ḍḍo uṭi dha:rki

              that-side-from thing bring
              ‘bring thing(s) from that side’A form herey is used as third person form, as well as proximate
demonstrative pronoun, similar to ha:n.:   (a) herey ‘this/he/she/they’ : as in:
           herey engako:l
           ‘she/this (is) my wife’.   (b) hawṭ-in ‘there’, as in:
          anga:rko hawṭ-in-ki a:kha:be
          shirt      there-at    hang-to
          ‘hang the shirt there’Proximate demonstrative adjective has a some-what contracted
form, han > hi-; while in the remote type hoṭan > ho- can be of this
type (see below).:    (a)    hi- 'this':    hi-manso          'this man',
          (h)iṭi- 'that': iṭi -manso        'that man',
                          ho-manso          ‘that man’   In Korku, the situation is much more elaborate though simpler.
Here the basic distinction is between proximate vs. remote. Within
each type, sub-divisions can be made, as follows:
           Proximate                                    Distant
               very     near                far       remote      pinpointing
               near

                        no:-ku                                ho:-ku   In Korku as can be observed from above, the main contrast is
between [iC] vs. [ḍV] vs. [hV] 'near vs. far. vs. remote'. But the
third distinction is not available for all contrasts. In Nahali a partial
similarity is found, in that, [hV] is 'proximate', and [iC] is 'remote'.
A set of infix seems to be found, which is not found in Korku.","[147, 148, 149]"
"  Simple contrast involving demonstrative pronouns proximate
ha:n vs. remote hoṭan can be seen as below:   (i) (a) ha:n eṭen pustok
           ‘this (is) his book’          (b) ha:n ayin hoṭan ayin beṭhe
              this good that good neg
              ‘this (is) good, that (is) not good’   (ii)       hoṭan masto
              ‘that (is) good’.",[147]
"   The above comparative table provides some interesting facts
about the possible closeness between Nihali and Korku. Out of two
hundred word list above, more than half are different between them.
Even without going into the statistics, it becomes quite clear that
they are not related from lexical point of view as well. When similar
comparison is carried out between Nihali and Dravidian languages
like Gondi, which was probably spoken in that area some time back;
we find many lexical items similar between them. This aspect
probably indicates to the fact that either Nihals lived for some time
with Gondi speaking people before reaching the present settlements.
Their oral literature does not reveal this aspect. Probably more
intensive work on their language and culture might reveal these
aspects.

                         NIHALI TEXTSThe texts are presented in fairly phonetic transcription, though some
extent of phonemicization has taken place. For instance, length is
indicated wherever observed; but keeping narrator’s pronunciation
into account, an attempt has been made to keep editing to a
minimum; so that the text is as far as possible as it is narrated. So,
length and nasalization are marked even though they are not
phonemic in the language, to facilitate accurate pronunciation. Also,
a given word may have length in one place, but may not show it in
another place. Sentences are given numbers. Sentences and their
glosses have been given subscripts for easy reference; however, it
may be noted that they themselves do not have any significance.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"

Chapterization of the work: Besides the introduction, this work
contains three more chapters in the first section. The second and
third sections contain Texts and Vocabulary respectively. This work
is based on structural model of modern linguistics. In the first
section, the second chapter, on Phonology, provides an analysis of
segmental sounds of the speech variety, discussing problems of
phonemicization of vowel length; retroflex sounds and aspiration;
and also discusses phonotactics and syllabic structures. The chapter
on Grammar, provides an analysis of both morphology and syntax
of the speech form. Morphology, which is primarily of simple
agglutinative type, does not show complex morphophonemic
changes. Whatever morphophonemic changes have been observed,
they have been discussed in respective sections. The model of ‘item
and arrangement’ has been employed for this analysis. As far as
possible all aspects of the language have been analysed. Still, being
based on ‘data’, and lack of full understanding of the texts, native-
like perception could not be obtained. So, the author is painfully
aware of the possibility of the analysis not being fully satisfactory. It
is hoped that future works will overcome these limitations. Syntax is
Chapter 1/ Introduction                                              5less exhaustive than morphology; but hopefully gives a fair
understanding of major features of it.","[15, 16]"
"4.2.9. Kinship terms: In Kinship area also we can observe
preservation of many terms in Nihali. In Nagaraja (2008), this topic
has been discussed in some detail. From that it becomes clear that
though some forms are similar to Korku, (due to proximity of the
Korku people), many forms are different. Here, the adjectives for
‘small/young’ is backa-, and for big/elder’ is bha:ga-. Also, there is
a term gita meaning ‘younger sibling’, male or female. Such
Chapter 4 / Is Nihali, an Isolate?                               143
common terms are very few. In this language also, similar to Korku,
a distinction is made between ‘self’s’ and ‘other’s’. The marker is -
ja to indicate ‘self’s’ whereas the other is unmarked. However, its
range needs to be ascertained.","[153, 154]"
"Korku also has many negative forms. They are the following: heba,
ban, ḍun/ḍuka, athika, baw, baki and bangon. (For details Nagaraja,
1999). These markers do not show any formal similarity with the
Nihali forms. However their placement is very much similar to the
Nihali forms. They either precede or follow the verb concerned.
Secondly, in both the languages when the negative marker is used,
tense marker is not used.",[153]
"Nasal sounds: Among the possible five nasal sounds, m, n, ṇ, ñ, ŋ,
first two are definitely phonemes with regular minimal contrasts. In
case of retroflex nasal [ṇ], it occurs only before retroflex stops; so
it is an allophone of /n/. Palatal nasal is a phoneme as it shows
contrasts. In case of velar nasal, it occurs rarely before velar stops.

demonstrative pronouns are quite marked and complex. Basically a
two-way distinction is made, between ‘proximate’ vs. ‘remote’.
However within remote, further distinction is shown between
‘remote visible’ vs. ‘remote non-visible’. However this distinction is
not always maintained. The singular forms are the following:

"4.0. General remarks: The above brief description of Nihali
structure hopefully unravels the intrinsic nature of the language. But
as it is today, is probably less distinctive than what it might have
been a couple of centuries before. Though this structure can be
compared with any language structure typologically; it would be
more fruitful to compare it with the language which is physically
very close to it than others. Among the potential languages of the
area, Korku, Hindi, Marathi; Korku seems to have more influence
on Nihali than others, as most of the Nihals know Korku. Therefore
here an attempt is made to compare these two languages. Wherever
it is appropriate other languages will be brought into the picture. For
instance in case of numerals, Hindi numbers have taken over
beyond 4 (as mentioned above), and various lexical items also seem
to have similar source.
    The vocabulary, which is most affected of all; shows signs not
only of borrowing from Korku, but also from other sources like Dr.
and IA. As it is natural many of the borrowings have become
nativized in their system. Once a noun is taken into the language, it
behaves like a native form by taking regular number marker or hela.
Similarly a noun can function like a verb, by taking verbal markers,
such as kamay or jerey or caka-; or use of suffixes like –ka or –ki
readily converts a foreign word into a native one.",[140]
"In order to obtain negative indefinite forms a negative form is
placed after the indefinite form. For instance:(122)      nani-ka pa:ṭoka 'some one comes' vs.
           nani-ka beṭhe pa:ṭo 'no one comes'.bikhil : This form is not frequently used. It appears to be a variant of
beṭhe. It can occur either preceding or following the verb.(123)(a) jo beṭhe/bikhil ha:go
         I neg           laugh
         ‘I do/will not laugh’     (b) jo cakha:w bikhil
         I    sweep neg
         ‘I will not sweep’.     (c) la       ca:n cakibe to:bi      jo bikhil cakki
         you(pl.) fish catch-to even then I neg catch
         ‘even though you (pl.) catch fish, I will not catch’.     (d)   hereyna biji ca:gokama ba:ken/r minḍi bikhil kappo
           him-obj neg scare      otherwise night neg sleep
           ‘do not scare him otherwise he will not sleep at night’.",[93]
"4.2.3. Personal pronouns: In personal pronouns Nihali has only
single set of forms as contrasted to Korku system which has two
sets, full and contracted. In both the languages personal pronouns
show a three-way number distinctions. The Nihali forms are:                                 Sg.    Dual            Pl.
             1p.:                jo    tye:ko          ingi
             2p.:                ne    na:ko            la
             3p.:               eṭey   hiṭkel       eṭey+la >
                                                    eṭeyla/ eṭla       As can be observed from above, in the 1st person, the
singular, the dual and the plural forms are different from each other.
Though -ko might be interpreted as the dual marker, the dual base
form does not show any formal relationship with the singular form.
The plural form does not show the presence of any marker as such.
So the whole form has to be taken as a single morpheme standing
134                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyfor 1p plural. In 2nd person, dual form can be obtained from
suffixing -ko to the singular form ne-. But the plural form is entirely
different from either singular or dual form. The 3rd p. forms also
pose problems. Interestingly there is no distinction made in third
person singular based on genders. If needed, separate gender
markers are used. The dual form is quite different. It does not take
the dual suffix -ko, which is used in both 1st and 2nd persons.
Further the plural form is complex as it is made up of eṭey 3p.sg.
form and 2p. plural for la.","[144, 145]"
"Consonants: Based on the availability of minimal and sub-minimal
pairs, the consonantal inventory has been provided.",[141]
"   It can be observed from above list, the negative form beṭhe > be-,
by retaining onlythe initial CV- and dropping the second syllable
completely. In some cases there is some assimilation with the
following consonant of the root.",[105]
"India is the homeland of languages of five different families- Dravidian,
Austroasiatic, Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman and Andamanese. There are a few
languages which are not part of any of these genetic groups and Nihali
happens to be one of them. Nahals come under scheduled tribes and their
population is estimated to be around 4000. The Language Tables of Census of
India 2001 enumerate a total of 122 languages at the national level- 22
Scheduled and 100 Non-Scheduled. This is an outright understatement of the
existing reality. There are around 200 languages in the country out of which
75% to 80% are spoken by the tribal communities, which are ignored by the
criterion of having less than 10,000 speakers. To remedy the situation the
Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore has undertaken a massive
national project to protect and preserve these endangered languages.
Globalization and overwhelming importance of English are commonly cited as
causes of language endangerment in India. But even the major regional
languages like Telugu, Marathi, Hindi or Odiya also act as killers of minor
tribal speeches. Over the past millions of years, the Indian experience had
been one of retention of minor tongues, but with the intrusion of electronic
media of regional languages, the younger generation is shifting its loyalty
towards them at the cost of its mother tongue. Under such circumstances the
study of Nihali by Prof. Nagaraja is a vital addition to our understanding of
the current phenomenon of language endangerment.",[4]

"   From the above illustrations various aspects of tense, aspect, and
mood become clear. (But some details of these aspects are also
discussed separately below). As can be observed above, these
elements are suffixed to the verbal root. The present tense marker is
-ka. The future tense marker is –ken (as in (c). The past tense
(immediate) marker is -i (d). If the root has a vowel finally, it gets
dropped before the suffix is attached to the root. The past remote
form is obtained by adding-ḍa:n to the past stem (e). The imperfect
form is obtained by suffixing -ḍa:n to the root itself. (kappo-ḍa:n
'about to sleep', as in (f)). The 'progressive' and 'present perfect'
marker is same. The progressive form is obtained by suffixing -kini
to the root/non-past form (kappo-kini 'pres. sleeping').(g, h). The
infinitive marker is -be.: me:r-be 'to play', ko:r-be 'to take'.(a). A
few verb roots do not take the infinitive marker. The verb root itself
will do that function. Context will make the distinction.",[79]
