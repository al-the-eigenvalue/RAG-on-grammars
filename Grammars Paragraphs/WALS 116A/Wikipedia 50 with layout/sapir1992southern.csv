"                          § 50. Postpositions.
   Paiute possesses a large number of postpositions or, as one might
prefer to call them, non-syntactical case suffixes. They are chiefly,
but not entirely, of local reference. They are true suffixes (or com-
pounded stems that have practically become suffixes), as shown by the
fact that they precede all enclitics and that, under appropriate
consonantal conditions, they are subject to the phonetic processes
of spirantization, gemination, and nasalization (e. g. -ruywa-, -tcuywa-,
-wtcuywa-, -tuywa-, -ntuywa- το). The position of the postposition
thus corresponds to that of the objective (§ 49). Postpositions are
suffixed to nouns, pronouns (except, of course, enclitic pronouns and
postnominal pronouns), and demonstrative stems (treated as the
equivalent of inanimate third personal pronouns).
   ( 1 ) T Y P E S OF POSTPOSITIONS. Etymologically, three types may
be recognized. A considerable number consist of simple elements
that cannot be brought into connection with other Paiute elements,
e. g. -να -, -να- AT; -upa- THROUGH, IN — DIRECTION; -ma- WITH. Some
of these seem to go back to Uto-Aztekan prototypes; with -DO- cf.,
e. g., Nahuatl -pa. A number of simple postpositions seem to occur
only or chiefly as compounded with others, e. g. -yi-, -tjwi-, - aya-.
   A second type of postposition is that compounded of two (or more)
postpositional elements. These may either be independently occur-
ring elements (e. g. -vaywituywa- INTO < -var/wi-"" IN plus -tuywa- το)
or an independently occurring postposition preceded or followed by
one not so occurring (e. g. -φοϊ-tuywa- INTO; -aya-^oa-tcuywa- RIGHT
INTO; -ruqwa-yi- MOVING UNDER).         Several postpositions that now
appear primitive are quite probably really compounded of simpler
elements, e. g. -var/wi- IN < -va- AT + -ywi-.
   A third type consists of originally independent stems, chiefly
adverbial and nominal, that are compounded in a postpositional
sense with preceding stems (cf. English AROUND, ASIDE FROM, APART
FROM, ALONG). Such compounds are often followed by a primitive
postposition, e. g. ni-ya""mya -va - I-SIDE-AT, AT MY SIDE < qa'ni'ya·-
SIDE. That -ya'mya -va - is a true compound postposition is shown

218                                  SAPIRby its employment with a pronominal stem like rii-'\ a noun compound
ηϊ-ya'mya-   is impossible. This type of postposition raises the
question whether all postpositions as a class are not in origin stereo-
typed compounded nouns (e. g. HOUSE- UNDER < HOUSE-UNDERNESS;
UNDER MY HOUSE =         MY HOUSE-UNDERNESS).","[235, 236]"

Bear Danceu4   In 1901 they had a bear-dance in the afternoon (5 to 6) about that time,
not as an important dance, but as a pleasure dance, just as they had foot
and horse races, wrestling, target-shooting. There is no particular leader
to a bear dance. About eight men sit down on the ground in a circle around
a dishpan (formerly a round basket) and play rasps which lie on the pan
nearly flat (only tilted to a slight angle), singing at the same time. The
singing starts in first as a sort of signal for the beginning of the dance.
Whoever wishes joins in; others may look on. The women gather on the
side away from the singers; the men are near the singers. The girls and
women advance towards the singers on the flat stomped-out dancing
ground in no regular line, and without keeping time to the music; then
each singles out a partner from the men by touching with a branch or
throwing a pebble. The woman then advances backwards followed at a
distance by the man she had picked out in time to the music; they may
thus advance and come back several times before joining in together. The
dancing parties do not keep in line, but each advances and steps back
regardless of the others. After a while (or immediately), they join, each
holding the right hand on the other's left shoulder and left hand behind
the waist. There seems to be no attempt to have the step (a sort of light
springy walk or semi-hop) keep in time to the singing and rasping; some
go fast, others slow. A song generally lasts from five to ten minutes. After
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field Notes           849a very short interval, the next is started; other parties now dance or the
same may dance again. The girls are supposed to represent the bears, the
men are the persons who dance with the bear women, according to the
myth. If one does not wish to follow the girl he is poked with a pole or
branch carried by one of the two or three officers (who may have appointed
themselves so or been agreed upon as such by the men, not the women)
and forced to follow. If one is not alert in following, it is believed that
when chased by a bear in the mountains, he will not get away easily;
otherwise he would. Many songs are sung. The last song is the longest,
lasting from about twenty to thirty minutes, and is called ""moving the
longest distance"" (miyotox mi4i')· If one of the members of a party gives
out, his or her place is taken immediately by a friend, a large number of
whom are ready. Both boy (man) and girl (woman) must not stop dancing
at the same time; the party as such must continue throughout. It generally
ends about sundown.
   When Tony was about eight or nine, the Kaibabs returned from hunting
on the Kaibab Plateau to Kanab in the fall and were instructed in it by
Tom (then a young man of Cedar City Indians, who had been much with
the Utes; he now lives with the Kaibabs and is considered the best singer
of bear-dance songs, being generally the song-leader) and medicine-man
Mamputs of the Arizona Paiutes, who had traveled much among the
Southern Utes. Tom ordered six holes to be dug in a distance of about 20
feet and had cedar posts (about 10 feet high) erected; no explanation was
given of this fence and it has never been used since. Mamputs sang first
as leader, chiefly songs with words; then Tom followed, mostly with songs
without words, which are considered more difficult. One of his songs long
after, maybe composed by himself, is: ""Let us go back home, my friend,
we are traveling about just for fun."" Nowadays the bear dance is generally
sung in March, but sometimes also during the summer, whenever there is
a general gathering or ""good time.""
   The Bear Dance takes place every spring, generally early in March. Two
lines are formed, one of men and one of women; the dance consists in the
moving of the two lines towards each other, stopping, then moving back,
and so on repeatedly. Six or eight men are used as singers of the Bear
Dance songs. These songs have Paiute words and seem to follow in a
certain order, each song consisting of a statement or of a question and
answer referring to some incident in the myth recounting the origin of the
Bear Dance. There must be several hundred of these songs; according to
Tony Tillohash, old men acquainted with all the songs would be able to
sing from nightfall to morning without duplicating songs. The singers in
850                       X Southern   Paiute and   Ute
the dance accompany themselves with rasps, rubbing cylindrical pieces of
wood over long, somewhat oblong sticks serrated on one side with angular
notches. Different sized rasps could be used. To secure a sounding board,
a small pit is dug in the ground and a basket placed over it. The rasps rest
on this by an edge obliquely cut away at one end of the side opposite the
notches. The ceremony lasts four days.
   In the Bear Dance, three officers are appointed with long pointed
sticks. If a man touched by a willow branch held by a girl refuses to
dance, he will not escape when chased by a grizzly bear. The dance is
supposed to give a person the power to escape from bears. The dance
consists in running back and forth, man with woman partner.
   In the Bear Dance a man and woman faced each other with one hand
on the other's shoulder and the other hands clasped.145 The pair ran up
and down keeping together in this position.
   The Bear Dance is important enough in itself to make different bands
come around to witness; generally it is held at the place where a
particular band camps. The Kaibabs have it every March when bears
come out of their dens; also the Arizona Paiutes have it; the Muddies
and St. Georges have seen it but do not perform it, not having good
bear-dance singers.146
Rasps Used in the Bear Dance   Mampüts generally rasps one direction, towards himself, two beats
to each bar. Tom generally rasps four times to a bar, alternately towards
and away from himself, the main beat coming on the rasp beat towards
himself, with which he begins.
   Before beginning to sing, it is customary to have one bar of rasping
(two ""towards"" beats with M., four beats with Tom); sometimes only
a bar is rasped. At the end of a song the rasp is played with four (or
five) rapid (twice as quick as before) strokes, the last being outward
and most accented. Raspers may follow either of two styles; they do
not all have to rasp in the same way.  uvwu tivun'     qamusaywÄyätsiYv Ant""

"   Before subordinating -qu- (§55, 1, e), -q ai- appears as -q a - (cf. §26,
1, a and b; § 30, 9); e. g. yaa'iyqw' aikaqoajjA AFTER HE HAD GONE OUT
HUNTING. For perfective participial -qanti-, see § 25, 6, d. Though
perfectly analogous in treatment to resultative -q ai- (§ 30, 9) and
perhaps etymologically related to it, it is in practice felt as a distinct
element, as shown by the occurrence of -q aijc ai- resultative-per-
fective, e. g.:tayo'isidiui-  to cause to cover        tjyj'tsidiuk-aik a had (evident-

An explicit inferential present-perfect (HAS EVIDENTLY -ED) is formed
by combining perfective -q ai- with present -yi-: -q aiy'i-. In general
it seems that perfective -q ai- regularly implies lack of direct knowl-
edge on the part of the speaker, differing in this respect from enclitic
-(n)tca- (§ 19, 1, a). Examples of inferential -q-ai{yi)- are:ivi-   to drink                         ivi'k-aip-l   what was evidently

    (4) -va •-"", -mpa-n future, intentive. In ordinary indicative forms
this element generally adds an intentive or hortatory force to its
fundamental future significance (contrast -va n ia-, -mpania-         below,
5). In other forms, such as gerunds in -Ut- (§ 55, 1, a) and participles
(§ 25, 6, b), it seems to indicate mere futurity. I t is used also in simple
future statements that are conditional on other acts. Examples of
- v a - "" are:

below) or dubitative -vi -, -mpi- (see § 33, 2). The former, -va p 'iyai-
(-mpa p 'iyai-), indicates an act in the past looking towards the
future. Examples are:

(-mpa-n), from which it is evidently derived, this suffix indicates
the simple future. Examples of -va n ia- are:taija- to kick                              taya'va n-i will kick

ροο'ίχα- to move, flutter                   yoo'i%ampa n-i (it)will move   (6) -p'iyai- remote past, narrative past. This is the element
regularly employed in mythical narrative. Narrative referring to a
relatively recent past makes use of enclitic -ywa- (§ 19, 1, b). With-
out doubt -p 'iyai- is compounded of past passive participial -p'i-
(§ 25, 5, b) and verbalizing -yai- το HAVE (§ 26, 1, b). This is shown
partly by the fact that -p 'iyai- is treated analogously to -yai- (e. g.
participial -p 'iyanfi-, § 25, 6, e; negative -p 'i'ai-, § 57, 2, c), partly by
the fact that -p 'i- and -yai- may become disconnected (e. g. -ρ ϊ-a-yai-,
see 8 below, diminutive -p 'i-tsi-yai-). Hence a form like a'ip 'iya'
SAID is     to    be   analyzed   as   SAY-PAST PASSIVE PARTIC.-HAVE,    HAS
SAID. In other words, Paiute -p-'iyai- forms are formally the synthetic
analogues of English perfects; the functions do not quite correspond
in the two languages, however.
  Examples of -p-'iyai- are:qan-   to sit, dwell                       qan'p-ϊyaK sat, dwelt, qari'p i-

   I t may be combined with a preceding inferential perfective -qai-,
e. g.

is found as sporadic variant instead of -p'iyai-; e. g. a'a'xavatcuywam-

compounded of past passive participial -ρ Ϊ- (§ 25, 5, b), possessive
-a-      (§ 2 4 , 2 , a ) , a n d p r e s e n t -yi-   (1 a b o v e ) ,   τ ο HAVE B E E N   KILLED
(BY ONE), therefore, as expressed by -piay'i-, seems literally to mean
το BE ONE'S KILLED ONE. I t seems to differ from the normal passive
narrative past (-t'ip-'iyai-) in more definitely implying an agent
and perhaps also in referring to a continued state in the present.

sort, compounded of narrative past -p 'iyai-, impersonal -t ua-, and
present -yi-, have been already referred to (§ 29, 14). What difference
there is between the -p 'iyai- and the -p 'iayai- forms with possessive
-a- (§ 24, 2, a) is not clear. As for the use of the present -y'i-, it is
very likely that the -yai- of -p 'iyai-, when final, is to be understood as

h a v e , § 26, 1, b, which implicitly refers to present time) and that this
implied -y'i- needs to be expressed after an inserted -t-mo-. In other
words, -yai- and -yai-y'i- have fallen together to -yai-, but -yait uay'i-
remains as such. Examples are:

                          § 33. Modal suffixes.
  There are only two specifically modal verb suffixes. Most modal
ideas, as we have seen, are expressed by the aid of enclitics (§ 19, 2).
The indicative has no special modal suffix; for the imperative, see §
52. For perfective -qai- as inferential, see § 32, 3.
   (1) -yv-, (-qv-,) -T)qv- irrealis. This element indicates that the
activity expressed by the verb is unreal, i. e. either merely potential
or contrary to fact (potential in past time). In the latter case it is
preceded by perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3) or narrative past -p 'iyai- (§
32, 6). I t is not used with present -yi- nor, it would seem, with future
-va·-71, -mpa-n.   Optative examples (WOULD THAT . . . . ! ) involving
enclitic -γα' followed by 'oai' have been already given (§ 19, 2, b).
Further examples of the irrealis are:
pay'i'k-w3 'αίχναηαχα      'oai' go-away-irrealis-he-then! he ought to
    go away!
ni' narja'i'aik a yA yaya'x Aqai%.u I anger-die-if-he cry (momentan-
    eous) -perfective- irrealis; had he got angry, I would have cried
pAxqq'up'iyaiyu'uywA      would have killed him
urjwa'rjuqv'q waxa' 'oai' would that it might rain! (-g·«·- perhaps
    dissimilated from -tjqv)
a
  'a'iyur)qvn-ix.a' 'oai' would that I might get well!

            SOUTHERN P A I U T E , A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE              169
  The irrealis may be participialized by means of -p i-. Participial
-kvp-'i- is frequently used as a base in optative forms with enclitic
-cuyaywa . . . n oa- (§ 19, 2, h). Other examples of its use are:
'α'ίρηχυ ρ- ur uru""ai' good-would-participle it is, it would be good
   (somewhat as though one were to say H E IS A POSSIBLE SINGER
   instead of H E WOULD SING)
uru""axw' sv""aiyuxvp i be-would very-good-would-participle, (it)
   would be extremely good
piywa'royoq-o p lni (-qo•- < -yqo -'ί) my would-be-made-as-wife, I
   would take her as my wife (song form)
   A past participial irrealis, -kvpiyanii-, is also found, e. g.: pAxqq/-
urjqυυ""p'iyanfini who would have killed me
  (2) -vi·-, -mp'i·- dubitative. The dubitative verb suffix is fre-
quently accompanied in the same or a preceding word by an enclitic -'
(§ 19, 2, n). I t may be rendered as PERHAPS, IT MAY (MIGHT) B E
THAT . . . Future dubitatives in -vamp'i·- (-mpa mpl -) are common
but, so far as known, the dubitative suffix is not employed with other
tense suffixes. Examples of -vi -, -mp'i·- are:ίνί'νϊ   maybe (he) is drinking; ivi'vl·''1 maybe thou art drinking
   (didst drink); ivi'jf arn 'rar/wa'"" maybe we did drink
an iaxwan a'ivT qa'ya' what-preterit-I say-perhaps sing- subordin-

qwa 'yuiuava mpini they (impers.) will perhaps beat me, it seems I
   shall get beaten                    § 34. Order of verbal elements.
  At this point we may conveniently take up the question of the
order in which occur the various elements that build up a verb form.
Four main positions are to be recognized: prefix, verbal theme,
suffix (prevailingly formal in character), and enclitic. Each of these
positions may consist of more than one element. On the other
                         X Southern Paiute and Ute
170                                   SAPIEhand, only the second position is necessarily filled, though ordinarily
one or more elements of the third position follow. The order of
elements within each of the four fundamental positions is, for the
most part, rigorously determined. Fifteen positions may be recog-
nized within the third, though, needless to say, only a limited number
of combinations among these are intrinsically possible. The following
scheme will be useful for reference (the letters and numbers indicate
order of position):
  A. Prefix
    1. Adverbial prefix (§ 20)
    2. Reflexive prefix (§ 22)
    3. Instrumental prefix (§ 21)
  B. Verbal theme
    1. (a) Verb stem (or other stem if followed by Β 2); or (b) combi-
       nation of stems, last of which is necessarily verbal (unless Β 2
       follows) (§ 18, 2)>
    2. Verbalizing suffix (§ 26)
  C. Suffix
    1. Suffixes of voice and aspect: -ya- (§ 30, 1); -yi- (§ 30, 2);
       -qi- (§ 30,3); -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c); -wo- (§ 31, 2, b); -tea- (§ 31, 2, d)
    2. -tcai- (§ 31, 2, a)
    3. Causative -f-ui- (§ 29, 12)
    4. Indirective (or transitivizing) -rjqi- (§ 29, 11)
    5. Pluralizing suffixes: -qa- (§ 31, 1, c); -'ψνα- (§ 31, 1, a); -t-'i-
       (§31, 1, b)
    6. Suffixes of movement (§ 28); continuative -n'ni- (§ 30, 12)
    7. Momentaneous suffixes: -iju- (§ 30, 5); -qu- (§ 30, 7)
    8. Resultative -qai- (§ 30, 9); passive -t'i- (§ 29, 13)
    9. Perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3); usitative -mia-, -mi-n (§ 30, 10);
       -ml- (§ 30, 13). -m i-"" precedes -q ai-.
   10. Future -pa - (§ 32, 4), -pan-ia (§ 32, 5; -n-ia- probably best
       considered as belonging to position 14)
   1
     A 2 (or A 3) + Β 1 (a) + Β 2 may, however, be taken as unit and com-
pounded with preceding (non-verbal) or following (verbal) stem.          Indeed,
this extended verbal "" t h e m e "" m a y also include elements (chiefly 1 - 4 ) be-
longing to position C. It is difficult to give rules, as composition takes place
whenever two or more elements or groups of elements are felt as logically
combinable or psychologically equivalent. Composition thus s o m e w h a t
 breaks in on our order scheme.

   12. Narrative past -p'iyai- (§ 32, 6), which may be split into
       its component elements by possessive -a- (§ 24, 2, a) or diminu-
       tive -tsi- (§ 35)
   13. Impersonal -{-ua- (§ 29, 14)
   14. Tense and modal elements: present -yi- (§ 32, 1); present
       -qa- (§ 32, 2); modal -lev- (§ 33, 1); dubitative -pi- (§ 33, 2)
   15. Syntactic elements, embracing:
       (a) Nominalizing suffixes (§ 25); or
       (b) Subordinating suffixes (§ 55, 1)
  D. Enclitic, occurring in nine positions, one of which, no. 7, may in
     turn be subdivided into three positions (see § 19, 4; § 4 1 , 1 and 4)   There is some doubt as to the priority of certain positions in C;
thus, it may be t h a t 10 and 11 should be reversed or, as probably
mutually exclusive elements, grouped together. Aside from doubts
of this sort, there are a number of disturbances of the above scheme
introduced by the impersonal -iua- and the passive -t-'i·-. First of
all, when -( ua- is used as indirect object of indirective -r/qi-, it follows
position 4 and precedes position 5 (see § 29, 14). Secondly, -tua-
regularly precedes future -pa-(nia-)         (position 10), yet follows
position 12. Thirdly, the position of pluralizing -qa- (no. 5), which
regularly precedes e. g. momentaneous -rju- (position 7), is disturbed
in impersonal and passive forms. In these cases it falls between
positions 8 and 9, i. e. it follows passive -t-'i - but precedes perfective
-q ai- and impersonal -( ua-. Thus, with normal ivik arjuy'i- SEVERAL

KILLED and &v i'r)iiq{w)at-u'ayi- THEY (PLUR. IMPERS.) ASK.           Lastly,
impersonal -( ua- follows subordinating -Icu- (see § 55, 1, e) in spite of
the fact that subordinating suffixes (C, 15, b) regularly follow all
other verbal suffixes.
   I t will not be necessary here to give examples testing out the order
scheme, as they can be readily found by the reader among the numer-
ous verb forms scattered in this paper. The positions assumed by
diminutive -ist-, which seems to be treated rather irregularly, will
be referred to in § 35, 2.","[182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"
"    The Indians were living there on the mountain and the two Horse-
tail Hair brothers were living among them. Some of those who were
out hunting were killed by some people. The two brothers said,
""Claiming what for themselves 97 might be the persons who act in
t h a t way to my people? Let me, then, go off yonder to engage with
them."" The two Horse-tail Hair brothers started off and travelled
along in that direction. At yonder place where they were camping
over night they asked each other, "" W h a t have you ever dreamt?"" 9 8
said Horse-tail Hair, questioning his younger brother. "" I , indeed,
am wont to dream t h a t when guns are fired and bullets drop down
just like mud, bullets do not go through the horse t h a t I am riding,
but if anyone shoots him right on the forehead he will be killed.

"" Y o u have always been dreaming just like myself,"" said Horse-tail
Hair. Some of the young men returned from spying. Then they

said, "" The camp does not look as though it could be easily handled,""
said they. On a knoll they sat and watched the camp from their
hiding place, and really the camp did not look as though it could be
easily handled. I t looked like a plain dotted with white"" passing
through the meadow valley. And at a little distance from the camp
there was a small knoll covered with firs.
   When it commenced to get dark, (the Utes) were assembled to-
gether on it. And then, as soon as everything became quiet, they
started off right into the camp. Horses were tied to each of the tents
and those (Utes) led them off one by one and tied each of them on
the little knoll. They always cut through the ropes with which the
horses had been tied. Some of those who were living in the camp
awoke. One from among the Ute Indians was left behind in the center
of the camp. Then he dug a hole in the shaded bend of a little wash.100
And then he covered himself with earth in it. During the night
some of the Utes turned back home. In the morning those two
brothers, having hung their hatchets through string loops tied to
their wrists, galloped their horses right into the (enemy) and, having
come out beyond them, they whooped as though it were nothing at
all. Turning up again (towards the knoll), they came right through
there, and at that place the two of them engaged in battle. Someone
killed his younger brother's horse. That elder brother of his charged
right past him, and when he did so, his younger brother lit right be-
hind him. They went up into that little fir-covered knoll (in order to
get a fresh horse).
   For five days the two of them engaged in battle, and their horses
were killed one after another. As though covered with timber laid
low was the open valley with people lying slain. The blood of those
who were killed was streaming in the wash. That one (who had
hidden himself) lay covered with earth in the center of the camp.
He was hungry while he lay in this condition for five nights. Horse-
tail Hair's younger brother was killed as dawn was approaching.
Then Horse-tail Hair was also killed when the sun was up, after all
the horses had been used up. On that knoll two brothers were sitting,
kinsmen of the two brothers who were killed. The elder brother
said, "" Now their whooping has ceased, but shall we two then continue
to walk about here101 after they (have died), when those have had
that happen to them?"" said he. Their horse had a sore back clear
down to his tail, and both of them got on top of him. "" You, indeed,
shall shoot in the opposite direction as we move along."" So then

  somewhat arbitrary.

is not very common. Examples are:

   Enclitics, as already pointed out (§ 17, 2), may be attached to any
word in the sentence. The pronominal enclitic elements will be
treated later in connection with the independent personal pronouns
(§ 40). Here we shall discuss only enclitics of adverbial significance.
Except in certain specified cases, they regularly precede pronominal
enclitics.
   ( 1 ) ENCLITICS OF TEMPORAL SIGNIFICANCE.           T W O enclitic   elements
are used to refer to past time.
   (a) -tea-, -ntca-. This element refers to the recent past and is
often best translated by the English perfect. For the forms -tea',
•ntca' see § 7. Examples are:
tona't-ϊ team I have been hit
tavL tsdea rjani pAxqa'yuni having-hit-past-he-me kill-me; having hit
   me, he killed me (note t h a t -tea- here refers not to tavi'tsi- HAVING
   HIT, but to following pA'qa'rju- KILL)
witn""tsiatca r) qo'q wi bird- obj.-past- he shoot, he shot the bird
wa'qutcani qava 'x A two-obj.-past- I horse receive, I received two
   horses
tona'ntcani I struck (not long ago)

88                                SAPIRimi'ntca' pi'pi'tci thou-past arrive, you arrived
u(w)a'n oyuntcA paiyu'yu over there-past return, has been there and
  returned from there
  If a pronominal enclitic is used possessively with the preceding
noun, the enclitic -(n)tca- follows (aside from -φϊ ONE'S OWN), e. g. :mqa'n intc ai)A mompa'qu father-my-past he roll-off, my father rolled
  off
but:
o·'cdsa r)a4>i quM"" arrow-obj.-past- he-own take, he took his own arrow   With interrogative ai- (§ 44, 2, c) -tea- apparently refers to present
time, e. g. a'iicarjWA WHERE IS HE? but there is probably an implied
reference to the past, e. g. WHERE HAS HE (GONE TO) ? It is sometimes
used with exhortative ivw'i- (§ 60,2,d), e. g. Wi'tcan ixa'"" LET-PAST-ME-
THEN, LET ME THEN!   (b) -ywa-, a general preterital element referring to more remote
time than -(n)tca-. For the form -ywa' see § 7. Examples are:
pA'qa'rpiywarjani I killed him (narrative form; contrast pA'qa'-
    rjuntca rjani I have killed him [just now])
rii'xwa'aqwA pA'qa'rjv I-past-him kill, I killed him
αη ι'αχιυ aiv'i qa'ya' what-past would-say while-singing? what did
   he sing?
aija'x uru""a who-past he? who was he? (-a: < -xw; § 13, 7, c)
rii'ywa' to'nA I-past punch, I punched (long ago)
  That -ywa- is no true tense suffix is shown by the fact that it may
be used with the verbal -y'i- suffix of present time (see § 32, 1), e. g.:
imi'xwar'uaqA      man'yqaiyiaq-A thou-past-interrogative-it create-
   present-it? didst thou create it?
ivi'yixwa j-ayA drink-present-past-it-he, he drank it (long ago)
   A broken form -ywa'a- (perhaps -ywa- + -a-, 3) also occurs.
Its morphology is not clear. Examples are:
iim'tsiywa'an wo""a 'ni then-past-I there-I, then I was there
ni'niaxwa'axain i qari'i' me-past-too sit-present, I too was seated
imi'axwa'axain i qan'i' thee-past-too-sit-present, you too (it was said)
   were seated

examples see § 39, 4.
  ( 2 ) ENCLITICS OF MODAL AND SENTENCE-CONNECTIVE SIGNIFICANCE.
Several of these are used in idiomatic connections that do not readily
yield insight into their primary significance. I t is believed, however,
that the chief elements and uses are given below.
  (a) -yainta-, -ayainta- TOO, ALSO. These elements always follow
pronominal enclitics, when present. The form -ayain ia- is probably
compounded of -a- (see 3, a below) and -yain ta-; it is not at all clear
how it differs in use or meaning from -yain• ια-.^γαϊη • ia- itself is perhaps
compounded of -πια- (see d below). Examples of -yainta- ALSO, TOO
are:
rii'xain i I too
uijwa'c • uywain ι that one too
cv'yuxwain i still another one
riimy'i%aint     we (exclusive) too
tFqa'xw'aivanixaini     I also will go to eat
  Examples of -ayain-ia- TOO are:
riiywi'axaini ya'a'ilfa' person-too died
marja'iAcuaxain i urjwaru"" aru""anA his-too he-is being, he belongs to
   him too
  Sometimes -{a)yainta-     is elided to -(a)yain·, e. g.:
rii'axain   y/tu'va n i I-too will-do
    A frequent modal use of -yainta- is to indicate a somewhat un-
expected inference or an emphasis on an idea that might be questioned.
I t may then be rendered IT TUHNED OUT, IT SEEMS, INDEED, JUST.
Examples are:
mari'acuxwainC         qant'ptnt    naya'<j>Axqafpiya' that (house) -it-
    turned-out old-abandoned- house-like seemed
qan i'am 'ixain i απϊ house-their-it-seems it; their house, as it seems

90                                SAPIR     An example of doubly elided -yain- is:
a'in'mayaxain·     'a'ik -A that-he-indeed said, that is what he did say
  (b) -ya'a- THEN ! INDEED. This element, which follows pronominal
enclitics, has emphasizing force. I t is particularly common in
optative and hortatory sentences. Examples are:
ρα'α'ίχ.υ·η·ΐχα' 'oai' die-would-I-indeed (for 'oat' see § 60, 3), would
  that I might die!
paiyi'k• ujur/jv ijwaxa' 'oai' return-hither-momentaneous-would-he-in-

  first- house-make-go; go ahead, then, over there and first make a
  house
mv,ayaya '''xa'a that one, indeed
  (c) -ywa- SHOULD, OUGHT. This enclitic is doubtless identical
with preterital -ywa- (1, b above). When used as modal enclitic of
obligation or in mild imperatives, it is followed by enclitic -noa- (see
e below). Examples are:
(•u)mwaniiJfaim iaywar'iianoA thus- resultative-usitative-should- in-
   terrogative-probably; that is not how one should act, be
mwan Mvim iaywar'uan oA dit. except that -avi- ΤΟ LIE is substituted
   for resultative -lp ai-\ one should not be thus lying
qari""miaxwa'n oA sit-usitative-should-thou-probably, you shall stay
Wi'xwa yan oA go-ahead-should-him-probably, go ahead and—him!
   (d) -n ia- LIKE. This is one of the most constantly recurring
enclitics. Though its primary significance is that of resemblance,
it is employed in several fairly distinct nuances of meaning and
enters into many idiomatic turns of expression. Its primary meaning
is clearly illustrated in:
-ψΐί'ο ηπί naya'p a rjupiya' thus-again-like appeared, (it) looked just
   like before
αχα'ηϊηίαηι naya'<j>Axqa* how-like-I appear? what do I look like?
so ""itsini like a soldier
rmt'an in i like my father (note that -n ia- follows possessive -n i-
   my, but precedes subjective or objective pronominal enclitic; cf.
   second example above)
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language             SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    91  A dubitative tinge is often present, in which case -π ια- may be
rendered IT SEEMS, AS IT W E R E , AS THOUGH, e. g.:
pAxqa'yufi'qanfinia ' j a-/)A naya'vai' kill-passive-having-been-like-it-he
  seems, it seems that he has been killed, it looks as though he has
  been killed
qu'qwt'va p 'iyain'ni'aywA shoot-future-past-like-him, acted as though
  about to shoot him
άηα'ψυανϊηι coyote, it seems
  This dubitative tinge may become so deepened as to justify the
rendering of -nia- as PERHAPS, e. g.:
ti'ma'q Aqain an ιαταη 'urjwA roast-plural subject-perfective-verbal
   noun-like-our he, perhaps the one whom we have roasted
u'u'rjwani'aml tini'arjqiq a'aiml he-like-thee tell-to-perfective-thee,
   maybe he has been telling you
  The idea of resemblance may also shade off into that of limit or
emphasis, e. g.:
fina '""va ntim anatjqwan-laqA    bottom-at-being-from-like-its, from its
   very bottom
  A number of verbs, chiefly such as indicate states of mind, are
regularly used with enclitic -N IA-, e. g. fiijw'i-. . .nia- ΤΟ HURRY;
                           'i'itampaqa-. . .n ia- ΤΟ BE TIRED OF; at-. . .n ia- ΤΟ THINK (lit., ΤΟ
SAY, AS IT W E R E ; cf. ai- ΤΟ SAY); ar/waiya-. . .nia- TO BE DIZZY;
an-ia-q-a-. . .n ia- WHAT DOES ONE CARE? (cf. an ia- WHAT? § 44, 1, d);
nanicui-. . .η·ία- ΤΟ BE FIERCE; i-ywaru'a-qai- . . .n ia- ΤΟ BE
WILLING, READY. Here belong also many verbs of sound or sound-
imitation, e. g. ampaiya-. . .n-ia- ΤΟ MAKE A NOISE; so a-. . .n-ia-
TO   SOUND   LIKE   FLOWING   WATER; OTD O-. . .N IA- TO     BUZZ,   HUM;
oq w'e-. . .n ia- ΤΟ SOUND LIKE COUGHING; and numerous sound-verbs
with suffixed durative -ya- (see § 30,1). For -»-{β- with numeral stems,
see § 36, 1; with certain postpositions, § 50, 4: 7, 35, 39; with certain
adverbs, § 60, 1.
  Quite unclear is -n'nia- following demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5) in
cases like:
a'in'niayaxain- 'a'ik -A that-like (?) -he- indeed said, that is what
   he did say
   Its glottal stop is unexplained.

definite significance to this enclitic. I t seems to render a statement
either more doubtful or less definite in application. I t may have an
i m p e r s o n a t i n g function. I t is nearly always combined with either
modal -ywa- (see c above) or with an impersonal -tua- (§ 29, 14) in
its own or the following word. Examples of the former have been
already given; see also -cuya-ywa-noa-             (h below). When combined
with pronominal enclitics, -n oa- regularly follows except in the case
of -η ί- I, ME, which it precedes. Examples of -n oo- with 4 ua- are:
pa'i(ua(i)yin oam somebody calls me
uwa'n untcan-QA sotsi'yuiu'"" over-there-past-indefinite peep-somebody,
   somebody peeped over there

""mpa'i'campaminu        iona't""' a'va no-matter-thee-indefinite strike-
   somebody-shall, I don't care if you are struck
   An example of -re-οα- unaccompanied by either -ywa- or impersonal
-tua- is:

  how to eat! (cf. f below)
  (f) -ru'a- {-tcu'a-, -ntcu'a-) INTERROGATIVE.       Examples of inter-
rogative -ru'a- are:

            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                       93
  Sometimes the interrogative is used merely rhetorically, implying
an inference, e. g.:
um""a'nar'u(w)a yA n\'m a'yawantct.i)qimwf        those (inanim. obj.)-

  I must be getting to be a medicine-man!","[103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111]"
"  The interrogative frequently combines with a following -γαinia-
(see a above) in the meaning of IT SEEMS THAT. The enclitic - Η Ι Α -
(see d above) may be introduced between the two enclitics. Pro-
nominal elements may separate the interrogative (or following -nia-)
from -yainia-.   Examples are:pua'r'uavar'onLxaint.'     medicine-become-shall-interrogative-I-appar-

element -rua- {-tcua-, -ntcua-·, -ntua-) has not been found alone, but
only compounded with interrogative -r'o- + enclitic -n ia-. This
compound enclitic has been found only with nouns. It follows posses-
sive pronominal enclitics. Examples are:

-cia-) has not been found alone, but only compounded with modal
-ywa- (see c above) and generally - n o a - (see e above). Pronominal
enclitics come between the -ywa- and the -n oa-, except, as usual,
-ni- I, ME, which follows -n oa-. Examples are:

 The primary idea of ONLY shades off in idiomatic usage to other
modal nuances, e. g.:
'i'nimiAcampariim(w)i        in-this-way-travel (plur.)-only-we (excl.),
    we ALWAYS do so when traveling

goes well with its suggested etymology), e. g.:

AGO; na'a 'c u SEPARATELY; a'iv^ic u ENOUGH; see § 60, 2), and very
commonly with independent third personal and reflexive pronouns
(see § 39, 1; § 46). For its employment with subordinating verbal
suffixes (-kai-, -leu-), see § 55, 1, b, e. I t has largely lost its individu-
ality with personal pronouns, as indicated by its double employment
in forms like mafi'c cu' above, i. e. mafi'-c u-.
   (1) -c uru'u- NOR CAN. It was not found possible to elucidate
this infrequently occurring enclitic satisfactorily. I t is evidently
compounded of -cu- (see k above); perhaps -ru'u- was misheard
for interrogative -ru'a-. Examples are:

enclitics, is often best translated PERHAPS, particularly when accom-
panied, in the same or following word, by the dubitative verbal
suffix -vi -, -mpl·- (see § 33, 2). It is also used in rhetorical questions.

follow certain other enclitic elements (e. g. -tea-, see 1, a above; -C M-,

Religion 1 1 1Ghosts   If at night in the woods you keep whistling, the ghosts will come.
   Various Indians claim to have seen ghosts. Once an Indian was riding
a horse on a trail through the woods and led another horse that followed
after. It was getting dark. Suddenly he heard a long melancholy howl
starting high and gradually falling. He listened, thinking it might be
someone in distress. The horses had been acting queer, moving their
ears uneasily. He heard the howl again, this time nearer. The horses
tried to shy away from the trail, the led horse having now sidled up to
the other. He knew something was up and suspected a ghost. He got
scared but kept up his courage. He continued to hear the howls, always
nearer and nearer. At last he saw a man appearing, walking through
the woods away from the trail. He looked like an old white man with
white hair, but was not recognized by the Indian. The Indian screwed
up his courage and hailed him, ""Where are you going, old man,""
thinking he might possibly be lost. He received no answer. He asked
several times, but got no answer. The old man just passed on and
disappeared. The Indian was thoroughly frightened and knew it was a
ghost.
   Another Indian was once working alone at quite some distance away
from town for a white man. He was supposed to be quite alone, yet
about noon he looked into the log cabin and to his surprise saw an old
white man with white hair sitting on a chair and leaning his head
pensively on one hand, staring blankly. The Indian ducked, then looked
in again, and there sat the old man, quite immovable. He was convinced
he saw a ghost. In dismay he ran off many miles away to town and
told his white employer he would not work there because of the ghost.
The white man poked fun at him and said he would go back with him
and see it. They returned, looked in, but the old man had disappeared.
It was a ghost.
   It is not a good thing to camp at a place where others who are not
definitely known to be living have camped. It is believed that the ghosts
of dead people who had camped there would be likely to linger about
the spot and bother the new campers.
                   Kaibab   Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes      829Supernaturals   Paiutes believed Wolf to be the most powerful being or god and called
him t'ivats· (understood to mean ""powerful one""). Coyote was consid-
ered the next most powerful and called S-inaqwAv1 (understood to mean
""one who would do anything, comic fellow""). They never prayed to
Wolf. Wolf was called niqwum w Ants· ""People's Father"" (njriimQ3 'my
father', niqwuq' w 'people', nyjw:< 'person').
   All the deer on Kaibab Plateau were believed to be owned by a
supernatural being named Qai e nacav'. During the hunting season (July
and June, also early fall), his name must not be mentioned, or else the
luck of the whole hunting season would be spoiled. He is sometimes
caught sight of by a hunter in one of two forms. Sometimes on the hunt
a man would see a man appear, then on the next instant he would have
disappeared; the man would then know he had seen Qafnacav' and that
his hunting luck had been ruined for that day. Or sometimes a man
would see two deer of more than ordinary size, into which QaiEnacav'
had transferred himself. The hunter would begin to follow them up, but
would not succeed in getting at them, and by and by he would begin
to get lost and get all tangled up, losing cardinal directions, up and
down, and estimates of distance; the deer would disappear and he would
be lost. If QaiEnacav' wished to do bad to a hunter who had in some
way offended him, he could lure him by deer-tracks which led to nothing.
Sometimes a man in traveling in a canyon would hear or see rocks
hurled at him from no visible source; he would know that it was
Qai e nacav'.","[831, 832, 833]"
"   (1) SPIRANTIZATION. I t is plausible, from what comparative
evidence is available, that spirantization arose typically when an

contraction was affixed to an element or stem whose final vowel

represents its original ending. Original ungeminated stops and -m-
regularlv became spirantized between vowels. There is some com-
parative evidence to show that c (s) and η originally alternated with
-'- and zero respectively as their spirantal developments, but this
is not deducible from Paiute itself and so does not concern us. ""Spir-
antized"" -to-, -ts- can be most convincingly differentiated from
geminated -tc-, -t-s- by the failure of weak moras to lose their voice

   ( 2 ) GEMINATION.    AS we have already seen, intervocalic n and
c (s) are always geminated or long, regardless of etymological con-
siderations; e. g. M.i'ci'q-Laiyini MY HANDS ARE COLD (cf. ma-' HAND
above). Geminated -m·- also has largely supplanted spirantized
-tjw- (see 1 above). How geminated intervocalic consonants arose
is not clear. In part gemination is a grammatical process (e. g.
ivi- το DRINK < Shoshonean ipi-: ''i'p i- το DRINK REPEATEDLY); see
§ 58, 4, a, c-f. In general, however, we can not yet tell what brought

about the geminating power of certain stems and elements and the
presence of geminated consonants in the body of stems. The contrast
between intervocalic geminated and ungeminated consonants is
doubtless an original Shoshonean feature, as indicated by compara-
tive evidence. Examples of -p·-, -t·-, -tc-, -is-, -q - (-&·-), and -q-w-

clusive, that geminating stems or elements followed by a stem be-
ginning with a vowel insert a glottal stop; e. g. i ""AKpa- τ ο SLEEP
BEFOREHAND (see F- S above). However, it is evident that elements
differ about the treatment of their final vowel before vowels, some
contracting, others inserting a ' . Thus, both ma-' and ta-"" combine
directly with a following vowel; e. g. maa'in-i- τ ο TOUCH and taa'in i-

            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                      67   (3) NASALIZATION. Nasalized consonants occur intervocalically
as a result of the nasalizing power of a stem or element; as the result
of reduplicating stems with interior nasal (e. g. qaijqa'ni- HOUSES
 < qan i- HOUSE; see § 58, 2, d); and internally in stems and elements
from obscure causes (in part these internal nasalizations may be
due to the assimilatory influence of a preceding nasal: e. g. nayqava-
EAR from Shoshonean *naka-, cf. Hopi nakuve, though elision of -a-
in parallel Shoshonean *nanaka-, cf. Gabrielino -nanax, may be a
preferable explanation; yet internal nasalization sometimes appears
where comparative evidence gives no apparent reason for it, e. g.
tuyu'mpa- sky, cf. Möhineyam duguba-t, Gabrielino takupa-r, yet also
Tübatulabal dogumha-l).
   Nasalized consonants that result from the nasalizing power of a
preceding element may be grouped into three classes: 1. -ntc- (-nts-)
that results from a -tc- (-ts-), original or itself developed from -t-
(see § 13, 3), that is either inherently ""spirantal"" or rather ungemi-
nated (e. g. -tea- preterital) or ""spirantized"" by a preceding stem
or element, provided there is a nasal consonant in the syllable pre-
ceding the -tc- (-ts-) (this type is not properly ""nasalized"" at all,
but is merely a secondarily nasalized development of the spirantized
group; see 1 above); 2. nasalized stops (andaffricatives) that alternate
with spirantized, but not geminated, consonants and that seem to
occur primarily, but not altogether, when the preceding .syllable
contains a -y- or -yw- (e. g. agentive -vi-, -mpi, alternating in no -vi-
CARRIER, taya-mpi- K I C K E R ) ; 3. nasalized stops (and affricatives)
that alternate with spirantized and geminated consonants. The
primary cause for the nasalization in the last group is generally
obscure. The presence of an interior nasal in the stem may be the
cause in some cases (e. g. taywa-"" TOOTH). Elision of a syllable
containing a nasal is demonstrable in a small number of cases (e. g.
pa'a-n το BE HIGH, participle pa'anti-·, cf. parallel pa'an i-). In cases
like usitative -mia-, -mi-""·, -kai- το HAVE, participle -kanfi-; perfective
-qai-, participle -q anfi- one suspects Shoshonean *-rnina-, *-kani-,
*-q ani- with ungeminated -η-, which would disappear between
vowels but assert itself as nasalization of the following consonant
when the final vowel of the element is elided. Examples of nasalizing
power are:ays-""   tongue                         ayo'mpi tongue; ayontu- to make
                                         a tongue; ayo'yqwai- to have

certain amount of sporadic variation between spirantized and nasal-
ized consonants, in part depending on nasal assimilation, but not
altogether. Examples are:wits'i'its-      bird                          -Tjwmisi'ds·     in c o m p o u n d s   (-nts-

  together                                       form)  Less frequently an original nasalized consonant takes a spirantal
form, e. g.:
                Southern    Paiute,   a Shoshonean      Language
              SOUTHERN      PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN         LANGUAGE                    69NUxqwi'nt'i   stream ( <     NUzqwi'-n      a,Tjqa'pa.NUxqwdcitciT)w'i           red-

                                              then -leitet-)  Not infrequently also nasalized and geminated consonants inter-
change, e. g.:

tuyqu'tvyu-   to become clumsy,             tuntu'qurdwiju-     to   become

  stone-clothes (obj.)                        tive form)  In the last three examples an original nasalized consonant has
become geminated, partly for assimilative, partly for dissimilative
reasons. In the first example the geminated consonant probably
represents the original form.
  Finally, there is some vacillation also between spirantized and
geminated consonants. A number of elements that are primarily
spirantizing are geminating in certain isolated forms, e. g.:τηα-' hand, ma-"":                           MA'pa'iyavu<j>i palm; MA'tca'i'-
                                              ayqi-    t o reach f o r ;   MA'pi'k    i-
                                              to touch with the hand
mu-' nose (e. g. mu-rona- to strike         Mu'pwi'k i<j>i mucus
 with one's nose), mu-""·.
   Quite distinct from this group, which evidently constitutes an
archaic stratum (thus, there is no verb -pih i- without prefix), are ex-
amples of stems which are inherently spirantizing but are treated as
geminating when compounded with stems that occur independently.
It is particularly verb (including adjective) stems, followed by noun
or verb stems, that are so treated. Thus, arjqa-' RED (cf. aijqa-ya- το
B E RED, aiiqa-r'ua- ΤΟ TURN RED) acts like a geminating arjqa-"" in such
forms as ayqa'-p ayV RED FISH, TROUT, arjqa'-q ani RED HOUSE.

Similarly, hi-'      τ ο DRINK (cf. ivi-yu-        WHEN DRINKING) forms ivi'-p                a-
7 ( A ) I - το DRINK WHILE WALKING.     However, these tendencies are not
consistently carried out. Thus, both ayqa'-q wica-R'i RED-FLASHING,
LIGHTNING and ayqa'-xwic α- το FLASH RED are found.            Such details
are of merely lexicographic interest. The tendency to use geminated
consonants in composition is probably due to the greater phonetic
similarity thus brought about between a simplex and its compound.
I t is the first step towards the dulling of a consciousness of consonantal
alternations and towards their development into mere historical
survivals.","[81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]"

   Edward Sapir (1884-1939) has been referred to as ""one of the most brilliant
scholars in linguistics and anthropology in our country"" (Franz Boas) and as
""one of the greatest figures in American humanistic scholarship"" (Franklin
Edgerton). His classic book, Language (1921), is still in use, and many of his
papers in general linguistics, such as ""Sound Patterns in Language"" and ""The
Psychological Reality of Phonemes,"" stand also as classics. The development of
the American descriptive school of structural linguistics, including the adop-
tion of phonemic principles in the study of non-literary languages, was pri-
marily due to him.
   The large body of work he carried out on Native American languages has
been called ""ground-breaking"" and ""monumental"" and includes descriptive,
historical, and comparative studies. They are of continuing importance and
relevance to today's scholars.
   Not to be ignored are his studies in Indo-European, Semitic, and African
languages, which have been characterized as ""masterpieces of brilliant associa-
tion"" (Zellig Harris). Further, he is recognized as a forefather of ethnolinguistic
and sociolinguistic studies.
   In anthropology Sapir contributed the classic statement on the theory and
methodology of the American school of Franz Boas in his monograph, ""Time
Perspective in Aboriginal American Culture"" (1916). His major contribution,
however, was as a pioneer and proponent for studies on the interrelation of
culture and personality, of society and the individual, providing the theoretical
basis for what is known today as humanistic anthropology.
   He was, in addition, a poet, and contributed papers on aesthetics, literature,
music, and social criticism.

   Volumes I-VI of The Collected Works of Edward Sapir consist, for
the most part, of shorter papers; by contrast, Volumes VII-XV are
devoted to longer works of monographic nature — grammars, diction-
aries, text collections, and extended ethnographic accounts. Many of
these were published by Sapir during his lifetime; others were edited by
his students and published after his death; still others are now being
edited and published for the first time. The organization of each indi-
vidual volume in this latter group brings together, in most instances,
works on a single language and culture; in a few volumes, however, the
unifying element is one of linguistic family or of culture area.

from the National Science Foundation (grant no. BNS-8609411), the
Phillips Fund of the American Philosophical Society, and the Wenner-

   Sapir received his doctorate at Columbia University in 1908, and
took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania. His first field
work thereafter, in 1909, was in Utah, with the Uncompahgre and
Uintah Utes. Back in Philadelphia in 1910, be obtained a much
greater amount of data on a closely related dialect, the Kaibab variety
of Southern Paiute, as spoken by Tony Tillohash, then a student at
Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. The major publication which
resulted from this work, Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — gram-
mar, texts, and dictionary — was written in 1917, but not published
until 1930 — 31; it is reprinted in the present volume. Permission for
this reprinting has kindly been granted by the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences. In addition, we publish here for the first time an
English index to Sapir's Southern Paiute dictionary, prepared by Wick
Miller, as well as ethnographic notes gathered by Sapir from his Ute
and Paiute consultants, here edited and annotated by Catherine S.
Fowler and Robert C. Euler. A topic index for the present volume
has been prepared by Jane McGary.

                            Introduction
   The Great Basin of the western United States was, aboriginally,
occupied mainly by tribes who spoke languages of the Uto-Aztecan
family, specifically of the Numic branch. In older literature, this branch
is also referred to as ""Plateau Shoshonean,"" and the term ""Shoshonean""
has been used for a putative larger grouping within Uto-Aztecan.
   Within Numic, three divisions are generally recognized. The Western
group includes language varieties labeled as Mono (or Monache) and
Owens Valley Paiute, in eastern California — plus Northern Paiute in
Nevada and Oregon, and Bannock in Idaho. Central Numic includes
Panamint (or Koso) in California; Shoshone in Nevada, Utah, and
Wyoming; and Comanche in the southern Plains. Finally, Southern
Numic consists of Kawaiisu in California; Chemehuevi and Southern
Paiute in southern California, Nevada, Utah, and northwestern Arizona;
and Ute in Utah and Colorado.
   The term ""Paiute"" itself, unfortunately, has no clear ethnic or lin-
guistic reference; nevertheless, the term ""Southern Paiute"" is well estab-
lished as referring to some sixteen Numic ""bands"" or subgroups which
share a geographical center in southern Utah. (For a survey of Numic
linguistics, see Miller 1986.) Among linguists, at least, it seems likely
that the currency of the term ""Southern Paiute"" has been reinforced by
its use in the title of one of Edward Sapir's most important works.
   Sapir's research on Numic began with a field trip undertaken early
in his career. After fieldwork on Wishram Chinook in 1905, on Takelma
in 1906, and on Yana in 1907, Sapir completed his doctorate at Colum-
bia University in 1908 and accepted a position at the University of
Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1909, with his student J. Alden Mason,
Sapir arrived in Utah to study Southern Numic speech, beginning with
the Uncompahgre Utes at Ouray Reservation. Finding that few Indians
there spoke adequate English, he soon moved to the Uintah Utes at
White Rocks (see Sapir's letter to A. L. Kroeber dated 7 September
1909, in Golla 1984: 43). A brief report, ""Some Fundamental Charac-
teristics of the Ute Language,"" was published in 1910 (Sapir 1910c,
reprinted in Volume V of The Collected Works).
   Back at the University of Pennsylvania in 1910, Sapir hoped to find
a Ute speaker at Carlisle Indian School near Harrisburg; instead, he
14                      X Southern   Paiute and   Ute
found Tony Tillohash, who spoke the Kaibab dialect of Southern Paiute.
Tillohash moved to Philadelphia for four months, providing Sapir with
much more comprehensive data than had been obtained on Ute (see
Fowler and Fowler 1986). Four short papers resulted shortly thereafter:
""Song Recitative in Paiute Mythology"" (Sapir 191 Od), ""Two Paiute
Myths"" (1910f), ""The Mourning Ceremony of the Southern Paiutes""
(1912c), and ""A Note on Reciprocal Terms of Relationship"" (1913c);
these are reprinted in Volume IV of The Collected Works. However, the
major descriptive result was Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — a
grammar, a text collection, and a dictionary — written in 1917, but not
published until 1930 — 31. This work is reprinted in the present volume,
along with a previously unpublished English index to the dictionary,
prepared by Wick R. Miller.
   Sapir's work on Numic linguistics is noteworthy from three viewpoints
in particular. First, his 1910 report on Ute described the typical Numic
phonological alternation of voiceless stops (p t k kw), voiced stops (b
d g gw), voiced fricatives (ß r γ yw), and voiceless fricatives (φ R χ
Xw); in his work on Southern Paiute, Sapir not only found the same
alternation, but also confirmed Tony Tillohash's intuitive awareness of
the relationship. Reported in Sapir's famous article, ""La realite psycho-
logique des phonemes"" (1933c, in Volume I), this finding remains one
of the paradigmatic examples of modern phonological theory. Second,
Sapir's Numic data made possible a historical study, ""Southern Paiute
and Nahuatl"" (1913f and 1915i) — his first important work in the
comparative/historical study of American Indian languages, and a pi-
oneering application in the New World of the Neogrammarian meth-
odology established in the Indo-European field. All subsequent activity
in comparative Uto-Aztecan linguistics is founded on this work of
Sapir's. Third and finally, the Southern Paiute grammar itself has come
to be recognized as a monument of American descriptive linguistics: a
model of accuracy, clarity, thoroughness, and insight which later schol-
ars have striven to emulate.
  In addition to data on language, Sapir collected ethnographic infor-
mation from his Numic consultants, and organized these materials with
eventual publication in mind. The resulting manuscripts had an ""un-
derground"" existence after Sapir's death, being consulted by several
ethnographers. They have at last been edited for publication in this
volume, by Catherine S. Fowler and Robert C. Euler, whose introduc-
tory essay explains the detailed circumstances.
                               Introduction                           15  Little has been published on the Southern Paiute language since
Sapir's day; however, there is significant work on the Ute dialect of
southern Colorado by Goss (1972) and Givon (1979, 1980); and on
Chemehuevi by Press (1979). There is an unpublished dissertation on
Southern Paiute by Bunte (1979); see also Bunte (1986) and Bunte and
Franklin (1988). Proposals for the reanalysis of Sapir's data on Southern
Paiute phonology have been published by Harms (1966), Rogers (1967),
Chomsky and Halle (1968: 345-351), Lovins (1972), Cairns (1978),
and Franklin and Bunte (1980). Manuscript vocabularies for a number
of Numic dialects, collected by J. W. Powell during his nineteenth-
century expeditions, are given by Fowler and Fowler (1971).
  Important ethnographic sources include Stewart (1942) for both the
Ute and the Southern Paiute, Kelly (1964) for the Southern Paiute, and
Smith (1974) for the Ute. Volumes on Chemehuevi ethnography and
oral literature have been published by Laird (1976, 1984). Recent surveys
of ethnographic and historical information are provided by Kelly and
Fowler (1986) for the Southern Paiute, and by Calloway et al. (1986)
for the Ute.

                             PREFACE.
   The following sketch of Southern Paiute, which was completed in
December, 1917, is offered as a contribution to the scientific study of
the Shoshonean languages. Whether or not it proves to be fairly
typical of the whole group in phonologic and morphologic respects
must be left to future research.
   My first field acquaintance with Shoshonean linguistics was gained
in a short trip during August and September of 1909 among the
Northern Utes of Uintah Reserve, Utah. This trip was undertaken,
with the collaboration of Dr. J. A. Mason, under the auspices of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. A number of Ute texts
were secured, supplemented by considerable grammatical information.
To extend and deepen the insight into Plateau Shoshonean linguistics
then obtained it seemed advisable, indeed necessary, to undertake
further researches. Hence arrangements were made by the late
Dr. G. B. Gordon, Director of the Museum of the University of
Pennsylvania, with the authorities of the Indian school at Carlisle
to have one of their Paiute students, Tony Tillohash, put a t my
disposal for the ethnologic and linguistic study of his tribe. I worked
with Tony, who proved to be an excellent informant, in Philadelphia
from February to May of 1910. A series of texts, much supple-
mentary grammatical material, a large number of songs, and con-
siderable ethnological information were obtained. The Paiute
linguistic data proved so much superior to the Ute which I had
previously secured that I have decided in this sketch to limit myself
to the former. Moreover, there is enough phonetic, lexical, and
morphologic difference between Ute and Southern Paiute to render
the attempt to describe both at the same time confusing. I hope to
publish a briefer sketch of the Ute language at some future date.
   The present volume is to be followed by a series of Southern Paiute
and Ute texts and by a Southern Paiute vocabulary. I t is a great
pleasure to recall the unflagging patience and helpfulness of Tony
Tillohash and the kindness with which Dr. Gordon did all that lay
in his power to make these studies possible. My thanks are due Miss
Jane McHugh, the Secretary and at that time Acting Director of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, and the authorities of the
Museum for permission to have these Paiute studies published by the

    SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE.
                  § 1.   Distribution and Literature.
   The Shoshonean dialect t h a t is more particularly treated in this
paper is Kaibab Paiute, spoken in southwestern Utah and north-
western Arizona. The name Kaibab is an Anglicized form of the
native qa'im vitci ""mountain-lying, plateau."" The Kaibab Paiutes
are only one of a large number of tribes or bands in southwestern
Utah, northwestern Arizona, southern Nevada, and southeastern
California that have been loosely grouped together as Paiute proper
or Southern Paiute. The linguistic differences found in the speech
of the various Paiute bands are slight. Paiute itself belongs, accord-
ing to Kroeber's terminology, to the Ute-Chemehuevi branch of
Plateau Shoshonean, a branch t h a t includes, besides the Paiute
dialects, the Ute dialects of western Colorado and most of Utah,
Kawaiisu (spoken in south-central California), and Chemehuevi
(spoken in southeastern California along the Colorado; the Cheme-
huevi are probably nothing b u t a Paiute band that have been sub-
jected to strong Yuman influences). I t is doubtful if even the geo-
graphically extreme Ute-Chemehuevi dialects, say Uncompahgre
Ute and Chemehuevi, are not mutually intelligible with considerable
ease. The two other branches of Plateau Shoshonean are Shoshone-
Comanche (including Shoshone proper, Comanche, Gosiute, and
Shikaviyam, spoken in California) and Mono-Paviotso (including
Mono, Northern Paiute or Paviotso, "" S n a k e "" of eastern Oregon,
and Bannock). Southern Paiute and Northern Paiute should be
carefully distinguished; they are not dialects of the same language,
but distinct and mutually unintelligible languages. Indeed, Ute-
Chemehuevi differs from both Shoshone-Comanche and Mono-
Paviotso in important morphological as well as phonetic respects.
Thus, pronominal elements are suffixed (or enclitically affixed) in
Ute-Chemehuevi, but prefixed (or proclitically affixed) in the other
two branches of Plateau Shoshonean.
  The Shoshonean languages, according to Kroeber, comprise four
groups: the Plateau Shoshonean languages; Tiibatulabal or Kern
River, spoken in south-central California; Hopi; and a group of
southern Californian languages comprising the Serrano dialects, the
dialects of the San Luiseno-Cahuilla branch, and the Gabrielino

6                                       SAPIRdialects. The phonetic, lexical, and morphologic differences between
these four groups of Shoshonean languages are evidently considerable.
All the Shoshonean languages, taken as a unit, comprise the northern-
most representative of the Uto-Aztekan stock. This stock includes,
besides Shoshonean, Nahuatl or Aztec and the Sonoran or Piman
languages spoken in the long stretch of country between the Mexican
state of Jalisco and the Rio Gila (among these languages are Cora;
Huichol; Yaqui-Opata-Cahita-Tarahumare; Pima-Papago-Tepehuane-
Tepecano). So far as is at present known, the Uto-Aztekan languages
are not genetically related to any other American languages.
   The published material dealing with the Ute-Chemehuevi dialects
is scanty. We have some sketchy material of Kroeber's; 1 a phonetic
study of Southern Ute by J. P. Harrington; 2 and a brief abstract on
Ute by Sapir. 3 Some linguistic material on Southern Paiute is also
contained in Sapir's Song Recitative in Paiute Mythology,4 A compara-

Bear Dance in March takes place. 133
844                      X Southern   Paiute and   Ute
   Myths were never told in summer, for then snakes would bite the
narrator. In winter myths were told, for there were no snakes about at
that time. Once a myth was started, it should be finished; otherwise the
winter would be lengthened, part of the summer becoming winter. A
favorite time of telling myths was in the evening when all had laid
themselves away to go to sleep. Some man, generally an elderly person,
would half-lie, half-sit with his head propped up by a log or mass of
blankets and tell myths far into the night. As he told it, the auditors
were expected to show their attention by comments (such as mym or
öwai' 'yes')> or by laughing at the humorous passages; if the full point
of any passage was not seen, it might be repeated, such repetitions often
stringing out a story beyond its proper length.
   Gradually the auditors dozed off to sleep; it rarely happened that
most of them, particularly the children, were ""lucky"" enough to hear
the end of the stories. If the narrator found that no one responded to
his good points, he would suddenly stop and call out, ""Are you listen-
ing?"" and, if no one answered, he might wake up the people and
continue, except, of course, such as had asked to be allowed to go to
sleep on the plea of being tired.
   The older Indians still believe these myths to be true. An anecdote is
related of a St. George Indian, who listened to the words of a white
preacher at the mission church as he told of the origins of things as
related in the Bible. After he had concluded, the Indian arose and told
his Indian friends, ""Now this man has finished telling you stories. Now
I am going to tell you Indian stories and true ones."" This anecdote was
related from place to place and considered a good joke on the white
man.
   Myths, no matter how obscene, were told in the presence of women
and children. Nothing was thought of this.
   Tony remembers having heard the following story narrated as true.
Somewhere northwest of the Kaibab Paiutes there lived two pretty
unmarried girls who were great friends. Once they went out far off from
the camp and sat down. One of them said, ""Let us do something."" The
other replied, ""What shall we do?"" The first said, ""Let us play with
each other. You lie down on your belly and I shall lie on top of you
like a man."" The other girl consented. The first girl then began to
copulate with her friend who found, to her astonishment and shame,
that she had a penis as well as female private parts. She was a her-
maphrodite. She was so mortified that after that she had nothing more
to do with her former friend.
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field Notes            845   Wolf made heaven and earth. Indians therefore worship him. Wolfs
brother is Coyote. Wolf is ""father of peoples."" There is no regular
worship of Wolf but they talk of him as Father.
   Originally there was nothing but water. Wolf told Coyote to make
earth but he couldn't, so Wolf dived down for clay at the bottom of
the water and made land and animals out of it. Wolf told Coyote that
snow was to fall only on the mountains and was to be picked as flour
by people, but Coyote thought it best to have people leave tracks on
real snow. Wolf wanted a person to return when dead, but Coyote said
no, he wanted people to mourn.
   When people die, they go way west to the shores of a certain river.
   Earth is said to be flat and round like a disk.
   If one needs a wind, as in winnowing ground seeds, and there is none
blowing, it will help to whistle for one. On the other hand, one should
not whistle too much if there is no need of a wind.
   After traveling for quite a while and then sitting down to eat, one
should not eat immediately but wait a while, perhaps as much as half
an hour. This is because they want to give the various parts of the body
a chance to come together and set. Some part of the body might be on
the road yet.
   There are, in the belief of the Paiutes, certain people who eat human
beings, but only females. It is not definitely stated where they live or
what is their appearance.
   q' u 'tuc' 'giant, one who eats very much'; seems to occur only in a
Chipmunk and Giant myth.134
   Mpu'tc 'devil, evil spirit', can assume any form. It makes people sick
and causes death. Whenever a person dies, his death is supposed to be
due to a spirit who shoots into the person with his power. This ""shot""
object is what the medicine-man takes out. puaniwu' '(medicine-man)
takes out with medicine power'; q' u 'qwi' 'shoot' used to refer to shooting
of evil spirit. A medicine-man can also ""shoot"" a person. There are no
different kinds of evil spirits.
   s0 e onup"" 'lung-spirit' (apparently believed in only by Utes).
   päq E apits 'water-baby' ('baby', i'qäepits; 'water-baby' also used for
'angel'). They live in water, are small like babies, have wings, and are
supposed to drag people down into the water and drown them.135
   niqwünoV bird bigger than an eagle, who carries people away in his
claws. There is a myth about him.136
   pärö u xwant"" 'water-fighter'; not a person, only water in Lake Paro-
wan that rises in approach of a person and drags him into water to
846                        X Southern Paiute and Ute
drown him, if he does not run away. Lake Parowan is all right now,
but it used to be bad.
   Mpui ~ Mp w i its punin 6 ni' 'evil spirit is looking around', used to
refer to light moving around (? ""will o' the wisp""). A ""devil"" may
change into visible form as of a person, but ordinarily moves like wind
and looks like a shadow.
   turunen'iarl 'whirlwind', is supposed to have an evil spirit in it.
   Spirits can make themselves heard by whistling or yelling like a real
person. i'nipwits includes also ""ghosts."" When a person dies his soul
(moyoav') turns into an ""evil spirit.""
   They say that in southern California the girls have a row of holes
around the vagina to which are attached strings. If a girl desires to kill
a man, she lets him copulate with her, then, when the penis is well in,
she pulls at the strings from behind her anus; the man's penis is held
firm until he dies.137Mythology   —    Recitatives  Wolfs singing is considered strong and powerful, also Gray Hawk's,
though to a lesser extent.138Stars and Sky   Lore  Orion's Belt is called näxäq' w 'mountain sheep'. The seven Pleiades
are called s gniaq' w or Coyote's Family. They are composed of Coyote's
daughters who fled from Coyote up into the sky when he tried to have
incestuous intercourse with them.139
   ""Shooting stars"" are known as put'siywidjap"" 'star excrement';
pü' u tsiv' 'star'. 140 When the moon wanes, they say m^atoyo^ai' 'moon
dies'; 'moon waxes' [no entry]; full moon [no entry];'new moon' [no
entry].
  When the moon has a ring outside, it is said to ""eat itself' (närxkyai').
  If you point at a rainbow, your finger will come off.
  Thunder is caused by the rolling about of a bear in his den.
  Never point at the new moon, for then your finger will get sore.
   Do not try to count the stars, for then you will get blind.

    The negative active participle ends in -ywa'ait'i-, e. g.:qa nona'c irjwai't 'i not dreaming
gate"" 'a'{i)yuywai't \mi not one who is good (among) several  The negative correspondent of subordinating -kai- (§ 55, 1, b) is
-ywa'ai-yu- (§ 55, 1, c), e. g.:na 'may'waiYUcampa t),t      riiru'xwA   without saying anything, (give)

  clus.), while we are not eating  There are absolute verb forms in -ψοα'αρα-, a suffix apparently
combining -ijwa'a(i)- and -apa- (see a). It is not evident how they
differ, if at all, from ordinary negative absolutes in - ap a-. Examples
are:
qatcu'tcami paa'iyoywa'ap ac υ not-preterit-they (vis.) countable
  (?)-negative-again, they were many in number (paiyo- is only
  used as negative verb; cf. qatcu'rarjWA paa'iyarjwa' aicv we (inclus.)

in -ywa'apa- (but cf. negatived agentives in -vi'ap a-, 1 above), e. g.:rii' qatc ampa'xAhtirjwa'ap αφι I not talk-cause-negative-agentive, I
    (am) one who causes not to talk, I do not allow to talk   (c) Negative forms of verbalizing -kai-. The verbalizing suffixes
-kai- το B E and -kai- το HAVE (see § 26, 1, a and b) become -ai- in the
negative. This - ai- takes the place of any specifically negative suffix.

  The negative participle corresponding to positive -kanii-          BEING,
HAVING ( § 26, 1, a and b) is -ait-ϊ-,
                                  e. g.:

   As we have already seen (§ 32, 6), narrative past -p'iyai- is com-
pounded of past passive participle -ρ Ϊ- and -yai- ΤΟ HAVE. Its
negative correspondent is therefore -p'i'ai-\ -yai-p-'iyai- HAD —, WAS —
is doubly negatived to -αί-ρ-ϊ'αι-.       The negative correspondent of
participial -p'iyanfi- (§ 25, 6, e) is -p-V ait-ϊ-. Examples are:

-n a'ai- as negative suffix instead of the normal -rjwa'ai- (b above);
participialized, -n a'ait i-. Unlike -rjwa'ai-, however, -n a'ai- pre-

                     1. PORCUPINE THICKS COYOTE. 1   Porcupine was going there. Right there were buffaloes, they were
moving on in yonder direction. H e thereupon went off yonder,
tracked them. Now there (one buffalo's) dung was quite fresh, it
was lying 2 there. Then he asked it (how long it had been lying there).
"" I am his dung for some time."" 3 Thereupon he went on, Porcupine
went on again. And there another's dung was lying. Then he asked
it again, and again went off yonder. When over there, he asked
again. "" J u s t now, indeed, have they moved on through here,""
said then the buffaloes' dung. . And then he went on again in yonder
direction. Now there the tracks of them were quite fresh. Then
he went on again; there, now, they were quite fresh. Right there
he asked (some dung). "" J u s t now they have set off from here,"" it
then said. So he went on in that direction.
    There, then, was a large stream. And those (buffaloes) were lying
on the other side. Then said Porcupine, "" C o m e and carry me!""
"" I ? "" (said one of them). "" N o ! "" said he then. And then again he
said, (""Come and carry me I"") "" I ? "" said one of them then. "" N o ! ""
said he, it was t h a t (Porcupine) t h a t spoke. H e said "" N o l "" again.
Thus those buffaloes were all gone through one after another till just
one was left. He, then, was the best one of them. T h a t (Porcupine)
said, "" C o m e and carry mel"" "" I ? "" said he then. "" Y e s ! "" said he,
the Porcupine. T h a t one came to him, he crossed over the water.
    "" R i d e on top of me,"" said he then. And then t h a t one said, "" N o !
I am afraid,"" he said, "" I shall fall down into the water."" Thereupon
the (buffalo) said, "" R i d e between my horns."" Then he, again, said,
 "" N o ! I shall fall down. I am afraid,"" said he again. Everything
 that belonged to him was gone through. And then t h a t buffalo said
again, "" You, indeed, shall sit in my nose."" "" No!"" said then the Por-
 cupine. "" I am afraid,"" said he. "" I shall fall into the water when
you breathe."" And he then, "" (Is it) all right inside of me?"" 4 ""Yes,
yes,"" said that (Porcupine) then. "" But how will you enter inside of
 me? Indeed I am afraid of these quills of yours."" And he then said,
 "" N o ! I shall be doing it so as not to be hurting you."" So the (Buffalo)
 said, "" G o ahead, then!"" and t h a t one entered inside of him.
    And then the buffalo started to go off into the water. Then the
 (Porcupine) asked him (if they had arrived on the other side), but
 he (said), "" N o , we are still in the middle of the water."" And then

the (Porcupine) spoke again, asked him again. "" Now we have come
to be near the shore,"" said that one then. And then he came out
on to land. ""Now, then, get out!"" "" N o ! "" said then the (Porcupine),
""further off yonder."" So he got some distance further. "" G o ahead,
now!"" said (the buffalo). And then that one hit his heart with his
tail, whereupon he scurried off, startled. Then he fell down over
there. And then the buffaloes came up to him at that place and
gored him there with their horns, and they ripped him open all over.
He, then, came out, the Porcupine. He had been sitting inside of
his hip bone, so they did not kill him.
   And so he came out, and there he was standing and singing. "" With
what, pray, shall I be butchering?"" said he as he sang. The water was
flowing a little distance along from there, and Coyote was walking
about there. He heard then, "" W i t h what, pray, shall I be butcher-
ing?"" as (Porcupine) spoke; Coyote heard it. And then he went
right up to there. There was Porcupine walking about. And then
he asked him, "" W h a t did you say?"" said he. And then (Porcupine
said), "" I did not say anything. 'With what, pray, shall I be scraping
off willow-bark?' that, indeed, is what I said."" And then, "" N o ! ""
said (Coyote). "" 'With what, pray, shall I be butchering?' that,
indeed, is what you said. Indeed I heard it plainly."" There they were
saying the same thing over and over again, they kept answering each
other. ""You did not indeed say so."" And then Porcupine said,
""Yes."" But then that Porcupine said, "" I did kill a buffalo right
there."" ""Yes, my friend!"" (said Coyote).
   Then they went up to the (buffalo). And then (Coyote) said,
"" T h e one that jumps over him shall butcher him."" So he ran and
jumped over him, to the other side of him. Then Porcupine ran but
jumped only as far as here, right on his rib he jumped. So then
Coyote butchered the (buffalo). Deinde Canis secundum Humen
defaecavit, and then he butchered the (buffalo) again. And then,
so doing, he took out all of his paunch. And then he (said to Porcu-
pine), "" G o and wash out all of his paunch. Do not eat anything of
it."" So he carried it off to the water and washed it there. Out of
it, then, a bit of fat broke off. Then he took it and began to eat it,
when somebody a slight distance away was heard talking. 5 "" H e
is beginning to eat from it,"" exclaimed he who was not present.
And then (Porcupine) was scared, while that (Coyote) went right up
to him. "" T h a t is not what I said. You are not to eat any of that.""
Going right there, he knocked him dead with a stick. And then he

"   (3) V E R B A L NOUN IN -na-.    Verbal nouns in -na- are freely
formed from all verbs and often appear in syntactic combinations.
More often than not, a verbal noun in -na- is used with a possessive
pronoun, often in a subjective or objective relative sense. When a
tense suffix is absent, it refers to present or general time. Futures
in -va-na- (cf. § 32, 4) and perfectives in -qai-na- (cf. § 32, 3) are also
very common. In the case of transitive verbs, the action is to be
thought of as passive rather than active, e. g. ampa'yanani MY TALK-
ING, WHAT is SAID BY ME. Nevertheless, the matter of voice does
not seem to be clearly defined in -na- forms. Examples are:ni'ni no'nam me carying-my, my pack
nirjw'i RUqwat uywaq an araTjWA person-under-to-plural subj.-verbal
   noun- our, our going under a person, our being beaten
w'a'yin a m· ur 'a-'i'niijucampA   shouting-their it silent-become-but,
    but their shouting became silent
to'o'ivi'oran'naTjw am bulrush-digging-his it, the bulrushes he digs
    (dug) up
rii' o'pa' αηι'υα η ι imi a'i'nami I thus do-shall thee saying-thy, I
    shall do as you say
tFqa'va n'arjw U'R eat-future-verbal noun-his it, his being about to
    eat, for him to eat
ngna'e-iva n ani what I shall dream
nqno'cjfainani what I dreamt
mwa'ij 'ani'k a 'ia'vuruijuqwainanl that-one do-resultative wounded-
    make-momentaneous-perfective-verbal noun-my, that one it is
    whom I have wounded  Cases of -n a- as noun-forming or adjective-forming derivative
without clear verbal force are uncommon, e.g.:
uru""anA being, property < uru'a- to be
wiyo'o*paq%nA vulva-perforated-verbal noun, vagina
ava""""nA much < ava'"" to be much
  For the idiomatic use of -n a-c-u- with verbs of doing and saying,
see § 62.
  ( 4 ) SPECIAL NOMINAL DERIVATIVES.    Here are grouped a few

         Less commonly -t 'ia- is suffixed to noun stems, e. g.:
      qani-      house                                   qaru't iomi my house-place, my
                                                           camping place
         Alone among derivative suffixes, -Ha- forms a reduplicated plural
      ( s e e § 5 8 , 2 , b ) : -Ηήα-    PLACES OF, e . g . :      tTqa't-ΪΑ       eating place                       tVqa't iriA   eating places
      qaru't iA       camping place                      qanit'iriA    camping places
         (b) -na-, -p a-, -mpa-            CONTEST, FIGHT.       Examples are:
      nayu'q-wip-A    war, battle with bows and arrows (lit., shoot-one-
        another-contest), obj. nayu'q wipaiA
      oo'mpA fist-fight, obj. oo'mpaiA
        An isolated noun suffix -va-' occurs in narjqa'va-' EAR (absolute
      naj)qa'va<j>i) < narjqa- ΤΟ HEAR. Also isolated is -mpa-"" in tuyumpa-'
      SKY < tuyu-"" UP. Both of these are old Shoshonean elements, cf.
      Hopi naku-ve,, Gitanemuk a-lca-va, i. e. a-ka-va (< *a-ykava <

      Gabrielino tuku-pa-r SKY.
         (c) - N -, -t 'i·-, -nti - CANYON MOUTH. This suffix seems to be added
      only to noun stems, but is most conveniently listed here. Perhaps
      it is related to -t 'ia- PLACE OF. Examples are:

recognized as noun suffixes (or stereotyped compounded stems),
but to which no definite meaning can be assigned. Among these is
-n'nayqa- (cf. perhaps nayqa- EAR-ORNAMENT) in bird nouns:
qiri'n'nayqats·         sparrow-hawk
ova'n'nayqA           goose
         wa-(tst-)     occurs in:
A'ta'q     wats-      crow (cf. parallel        A'ta'p'its·)   -tea - occurs in:
u'qwa'tsa ts- small spider (cf. u'qwa'mpi                      tarantula)   (5) PASSIVE PARTICIPLES.      T W O distinct suffixes of closely related
meaning are frequently employed in Paiute to express the passive
participle, -p i- and -ρϊ-.  I t is difficult to say just what difference
of meaning there is between these elements, though they are not
used interchangeably. On the whole, -p i- seems to have a more
substantival force, -p i- a more truly participial one; it would be
incorrect to press this point, however. Moreover, -p i- is primarily
tenseless except when preceded by specific tense elements, e. g.
future -να -; -ρ ϊ- is always preterital. Both may be formed from
intransitive stems, though derivatives formed from transitive verbs
are naturally far more common.

   (6) ACTIVE PARTICIPLES. The primary form of the active parti-
cipial suffix is -ti-n. When unpreceded by a tense element, it refers
to present time or, particularly in secondary substantival uses, is
tenseless. Participles of explicitly temporal reference may be
formed from the present participle by prefixing appropriate temporal
suffixes to -ti-n. Animate plurals are formed by suffixing -m i- (§
48, 1, a), e. g. -rim 'i-.
    (a) Present participle: -fi-"" (-<«-""• after i; -ntci-n after nasal +      i),
-ti-n, -nfi-"". Examples are:

   (c) Usitative participle: -vatci-"", -mpatci-"". The usitative element
-να-, phonetically treated as though terminating in -i-', is not other-
wise used as a verb suffix. I t is perhaps identical with postpositive -bo-
a t (§ 50,4, 37), which also changes following -t- to -tc-. Examples are:
non o'c i- to dream                     non a'c ivatci    accustomed     to

preterital -p'iyai-.   This participle differs from the preceding in
referring more explicitly to past time, also in being more frequently
used in narrative as a sort of equivalent for properly preterital forms
in -p 'iyai- (see §32 , 6; also § 55, 4, e). Examples are:

   (f) Animate plurals of participles.    Animate plurals of active
participles have been already referred to. They end in -fi-m 'i-. A
curious idiom allows of their use also as singulars. This takes place
when the participle refers to a person (or animal) that is singled out
from a number or is compared with others. The plural ending of the
participle, in other words, refers to the implied collectivity rather
than to the person explicitly indicated. Examples are:
qu'tca'p-oto'qwarimi   blue-round-adj. verb-partic.-plur., one who is
   blue around (as contrasted with others of different color)

  Analogous constructions are found in other than -fi-n forms, e. g.:

  person (as contrasted with others)                       § 26.   Verbalizing Suffixes.
   A number of verb-forming suffixes are in common use. They trans-
form noun, adjective, and demonstrative stems into verbs.
   (1) Elements suffixed to noun and adjective stems.
  (a) -yai-, -q ai-, -rjqai-, ΤΟ BE. Any noun or participle may become
a verb of being by means of this suffix, e. g.:
nitjwi-' person                        niywl'xaiYU while being a person
qani-' house                           qam'xai-ηυ house-be-momentan-

                                          und-like, if (you) are to be
                                         greater than I
   For negative - ai- NOT TO BE, see § 57, 2 c.
   Before subordinating -q u- (§ 55,1, e) verbifying -Icai- ΤΟ BE becomes
-ka -, e. g.:
a'ip atsiyai-   to be a boy            a'ip aisiya q uni   when I was a
                                          boy
   For corresponding negative -a '-q u- WHEN NOT TO BE, see § 57, 2, c.
  The active participial form of this suffix is -yanti-n, -q anfi-"",
-Tjqanfi-"". e. g.:
                           Southern   Paiute,    a Shoshonean                Language                     SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN                           LANGUAGE           133tA'qa      -'     to be flat                            tA'qa       'yanti   being flat, flat coun-

'ontcoxL-'        to be one-eyed                        'ontco'xtyanti      one-eyed
yu(w)a-'                                                yu{w)a    'axant'i  being level, plain
wTqanoi-'                to be circular                 wfqo'noikant'i        circular
  As may be seen from these examples, -kanfi-n        forms many nouns
and adjectives. Many of these participial forms, indeed, seem to be
more freely used than the -kai- verbs from which they are derived
   Compounded with indirective -iiqi- (§ 29, 2) this element seems to
appear as -ai- (cf. negative -ai- NOT TO BE, § 57, 2, c). -ai-rjqi- seems
to indicate το ACT L I K E —το. It occurs in:
                 to be coyote; to
c'ina'ywavi-ylfai-                                      φια'ψνανι'αίηφ,ί'     acts like coyote
   be amorous, ""mushy""                                      to (her); acts in an inordinately
                                                            amorous manner toward (her)
   (b) -yai-, -qai-, -rjqai- ΤΟ HAVE. This element closely parallels the
preceding in all its forms (including negative - a i ; subordinate - k a - q u - ;
negative subordinate -a'-qu-;      participle -kanti-n).    From the form
alone it is not always possible to tell whether the -kai- suffix denotes το
B E o r τ ο H A V E ; e . g . tümpv,i}f         ai-   τ ο B E A R O C K o r τ ο H A V E A ROCK.
Frequently, however, the theoretical ambiguity is removed by the
use of a nominal possessive suffix (§ 24, 2) before the -kai-; e. g.
sari      'tsiyaivätcf       WONT TO B E        A DOG, b u t sari'vurjquxwaivätci             WONT
TO H A V E A DOG (§ 24, 2, e). On account of their particular frequency,
forms in -a-yai- (§ 24, 2, a) are separately listed.
  Examples of -yai-, -q ai-, -rjqai- ΤΟ H A V E are:

This suffix, which is evidently closely related to the preceding, is used

less often with noun stems. Examples are:tuywa-'      to be dark, night            tuywa'ru'int'i becoming night, at

Most frequently it is used in its participial form, -kari-n. Examples

   (2) Elements     suffixed to demonstrative   stems. For demonstrative

  (a) -ro'a- το BE; makes substantive verbs from demonstrative o-
and u-, e. g. aro'a- το BE (visible subject). Substantive verbs are
dealt with in § 56.

   (b) -ni- ΤΟ ACT, DO, BE. This suffix makes verbs of action or
manner out of demonstrative stems, also out of interrogative aya-,
e. g. an i- ΤΟ DO SO, TO ACT THUS; ayan-i- ΤΟ DO WHAT? TO ACT HOW?
For examples see § 43, 3. These verbs are often used absolutely as
adverbs of manner, e. g. aya'm HOW?
   (c) -n'i- (-n i'i-) verbalizing suffix appended to demonstrative
stem + postposition (see § 43, 1). From ίνα·- THIS-AT, H E B E , e. g., is
formed iva n 'i- το BE HERE. It is possible that this element is
identical with continuative -n-'i- (§ 30, 12); both are two-moraed.
Examples are:

                               § 27.   General remarks.
   The suffixes added to verb stems or verbalized bases (see § 26)
may be grouped into six distinct classes: suffixes of movement, of
voice, of verbal aspect, of plurality, of tense, and of mode. Many
of these may be considered as more properly formal than derivative
in character, but the line is in any case not easy to draw.

                 SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                        139                            § 28.    Suffixes of movement.
   In origin these are in all probability verb stems that have become
specialized as second members of verb + verb compounds (§ 18, 2, a).
This appears quite plausible in view of the fact that several verb
stems of movement (e. g. pay(a)i-n ΤΟ GO, pa(i)yi- ΤΟ RETURN) are
frequently used in composition in a quasi-formal sense.  (1) -ywa'ai-', -qwa'ai-', -yqwa'ai-' ΤΟ GO WHILE -ING, TO MOVE.
This is generally used only in verbs whose animate subject is singular.
For corresponding plurals the compounded verb-stem -mia- SEVERAL
MOVE is used (for examples see § 18, 2, a). Examples of -ywa'ai- are:nontsi-'      to fly                         nontsi'%w'a.i'   goes flying, flies

   The idea of GOING, as some of these examples show, shades off into
that      of    BECOMING.    (2) -q-waai-' (ΤΟ MOVE) OFF, AWAY.      This is evidently nothing
but a specialized use of the geminated form of the preceding suffix.

merely a specialized use of the spirantized form of (a). Examples
are:
qu'qwi-    to shoot                    qu'qwi'xw'oiva n-Lanl I shall go
                                          in order to shoot

ani- to do so                          ani''aip     lya went and did so   In many cases it is not easy to be clear as to whether examples of
-qwa'ai- and -ywa'ai- are to be classed under (a) or under (b) and
(c). I t is highly probable that -q wa'ai- (b) and -ywa'ai- (c) are
related to each other as momentaneous and durative (see § 53, 2, b for
momentaneous gemination). The two uses of -ywa'ai-, WHILE GOING
and το GO IN ORDER TO, are reflected in its plural correspondent
-m-ia-, e. g. qa'mia- SEVERAL SING WHILE ON (THEIR) WAY and
SEVERAL GO IN ORDER TO SING.   (4) -m'mia- CONTINUOUS MOTION. This element, which is perhaps
etymologically connected with plural mia- SEVERAL TRAVEL, is very
similar in significance to -kwa'ai- (a) and to compounded -pay(a)i-
WHILE JOURNEYING.       The idea of continuity, however, seems to
be more explicit. Moreover, the movement referred to is not neces-
sarily the straight-line movement of normal walking or travel, but
may be the periodic movement say of dancing. Examples are:poya-     to run                       po• yam mia.t        goes running,

                         § 29.   Suffixes of voice.
   There are two groups of suffixed elements that indicate voice, i. e.
direction of action with reference to subject, object, or indirect object.
The first group (1-9) is a primary series that is not freely used; that is
closely welded with the verb stem (often with internal stem changes);
that occurs in contrasting pairs of mediopassive (or intransitive)
and active (or transitive); and that, for the most part, involve at the
same time other ideas than that of voice, namely verbal aspect (see
3 below) and number. This group will be only listed here for con-
venience of reference and taken up later under other headings. The
second group (10-14) is used with great freedom and indicates voice
relations of a somewhat more external sort. Suffixes of the latter
sort are often appended to the former.  (1) -q-i- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of momentaneous aspect
and singular number (see § 30, 3).
   (2) -71-, (-ijqi-) mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of iterative-dura-
tive aspect (see § 30, 2).
  (3) -ya- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of durative aspect (see
§ 30, 1).
  (4) -tcai- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of primarily durative
aspect and of plural number (see § 31, 2, a).
   (5) -na- transitive suffix of durative aspect and singular number
of object (see § 31, 2, b).
  (6) -n'na- transitive suffix of momentaneous aspect and singular
number of object (see § 31, 2, c).
  (7) -tea- transitive suffix of plural number of object (see § 31, 2, d).
  (8) -a - final stem vowel indicating active voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -i- (9).
  (9) -i- final stem vowel indicating inactive voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -a - (8).
   (10) -rjqi-"" transitivizing or activating suffix appended to verbs
of primarily mediopassive aspect. It is particularly common with
preceding -q i-, -yi- (1 and 2 above) and generally occurs with an
instrumental prefix in the verb (§ 21). Before it mediopassive -i- (see
9 above) sometimes becomes active -a - (8); an -a- of the active stem

    (11) -rjqi-' indirective: το, FOR. This extremely common suffix
expresses dative or indirective relations and may be rendered το,

cases the person of the indirect object is not really affected by the
action at all but is merely interested in it. Such ethical datives with
first person indirect object are frequently employed to indicate an
affectionate attitude on the part of the speaker, e. g.:
αχα'η iyqitjuqwaiyurii' ani'k a     what-do-for-momentaneous-resulta-
  tive-subordinate-me-thou do-so? what happened to you for me?

  In a considerable number of cases the indirective - r j q i h a s grown
so to the stem as to give a new meaning in which the indirective
idea is not very prominent, e. g.:
pitci-   to arrive                    pitcATjqi- to arrive to, engage
                                         with (cf. also uni-vitci- to do-
                                         arrive, attack)
nayuqwi- to reciprocally-shoot        nayu'q wiijqi- to fight

tive verbs. Examples are:

   Much less frequently -iui- makes causatives out of nouns, e. g.:

   A few survivals seem to indicate t h a t -tui- is but the geminated
form of an older variable -r'ui-, -t ui-, -ntui-, which has become
generalized for all cases. There seems also to have been an alterna-
tion between momentaneous -t'ui- andd urative -r'ui- (see § 53, 2, b).
An example of causative -ntui- is 'a'cmtui- τ ο LIKE. Causative
-r'ui- (durative) is exemplified in iyä'r'ui- το CAUSE TO BE AFRAID, TO
FRIGHTEN; with this contrast momentaneous iya'tui-         το FRIGHTEN
(at one moment of time).   (12a) -n-i- causative. This element occurs so uncommonly t h a t
it has not been found possible to determine its precise application.
Examples are:

naywi'qa'minip'iya'       self-cover-causative-past, covered (him)self

Ν A' SO'XO' ma'mp'iya' covered (him)self with moist ground, dirt (cf.
    also NA^sa'xu'map 'iya' covered self with dirt)
   In the last two examples, which are provided with reflexive pre-
fixes, it is to be noted t h a t the reflexive is better considered the logical
object of the causative suffix than of the verb; e. g. HE CAUSED HIM-
SELF TO BE COVERED, not HF. CAUSED TO COVER HIMSELF.                 Contrast,

is best defined as an indirect causative, like -rjqi- (10, 11), whose -y-
is perhaps a reduced form of -ni-; e. g. HE MADE IT INTO A LEG,
HE COVERED TO HIMSELF.   (13) -ti -s passive; sometimes heard as -H-, but always two-
moraed. This suffix is freely used to make true passives out of
transitive verbs. Examples are:
tana- to hit, punch                      t,ma't i svwa n-iani I shall be hit
pAxqa-r)u- to kill                       pA'qa'yuti'qaq a'      (they) have

   The last two examples illustrate passive participles in -t'i-ri-n (cf.
§ 25, 6, a). These differ from passive participles in -pi- and -p'i-
(§ 25, 5) in referring to passing or non-characteristic states. Con-
trasting with SA'pi'x-AtiRi, for instance, is SA'pi'xam ip i ONE WHO
IS ALWAYS OVERCOME (-m i- is usitative, § 30, 10).
   Passives may be readily formed from causatives, e. g. ivi'( uii}uti -
tca r)A D R I N K - C A U S E - M O M E N T A N E O U S - P A S S I V E - P R E T E R I T -   H E , HE   WAS
CAUSED TO DRINK.      Here the causative suffix precedes the passive,
as is to be expected. Curiously enough, the same order is followed
in causatives of passives, an indirective -rjqi- coming in between the
causative suffix and the passive - t i - , e. g.:
maa'i(  uiyki'fi v""'a yarayWA   catch-cause-to-passive-shall-he-us, he will
   get us caught (lit., he will cause to us to be caught)
pA'qa'niuiyqiti tca rjA kill-cause-to-passive-preterit-him, (he) caused
   him to be killed (for -nlui- cf. 12 above)
  In other words, the passive suffix can not precede the causative.
In the preceding examples the indirective is required to point to the
logical object as the indirect object, the passive of the verb itself
being apparently conceived of as the direct object, e. g. H E WILL-
CAUSE-BEING-CAUGHT TO-US.        That these forms are causatives of
passives, not, as would be inferred from their appearance, passives of
causatives, is proved by the absence of a plural subjective -q a- (see
§ 31, 1, c) in the first form above; this would be required if the fomr
were to be understood as WE SHALL B E CAUSED TO B E CAUGHT BY HIM.
   (14) -tu'a-' (-t' ua- ) impersonal. Verbs with impersonal subject
or, less often, object refer either to an indefinitely defined person or
to a collectivity, people in general. In the latter case, if used sub
jectively, it may be preceded by the pluralizing -qa- (§ 31, 1, c). The
impersonal suffix is often employed as the equivalent of the passive,
never simultaneously with it. It follows perfective -qai- and nar-
rative preterit -ρϊ(α)·γαί-, but precedes present -yi- and future
-va (nia)-    (see § 34). Curiously enough, present -yi- regularly
                       X Southern Paiute and Ute
148                                SAPIR
follows -tu'a- even in preterit tense forms (cf. also -p• la-yai-tua-y'i-; §
32, 8). As already noted (§ 19, 2, e), it is frequently accompanied
by enclitic -w oa-. Examples of subjective -t-u'a- are:
pAKqa'rju(ua{i)ylayA kill-momentaneous-impersonal-present-him, they
    (indef.) kill him, he is being killed
pApa' cp Aqwa' iyupi'iyai' (iia(i)yiaml kill (distributive)- go-momentan-

;pA*qa'i)uqwai'tua{i)yiar)A      kill-momentaneous-perfective-impersonal-
    present-him, they (indef.) killed him, he was killed
tavi'iua'ami     hit-impersonal-thee, you (were) hit (by somebody)

tVqa'qAtuayir'uanuaxainC           eat-plural-impersonal-present-interroga-
    tive-indefinite-indeed, it seems that people are eating
   As impersonal object -t u'a-' seems to be used only indirectly after
-rjqi-, e. g.:
qa'ijqitu'a(i)yini       sing-to-impersonal-present-I, I sing with them
   (indef.)
nayu'q-vjiyqiiu'a{u)x u          fight-to-impersonal-when, when fighting
   (with people)
nl' o-'pa' ani'-rjqiiuaxw'oiva' I that-way do-to-impersonal-go-shall,

naia' i}v)tijrp(uaq • XA piya'    play-hand-game-to-impersonal-plural-past,
   (they) played the hand game with people, the hand game was
   played with them
  These examples show that -yqi-i ua- generally denotes cooperation
with a group. Moreover, the two suffixes form a close unit, as they
occur before elements that would normally precede -t-u'a- alone (e. g.
-yw'ai- ΤΟ GO TO, narrative preterit -p 'iyai-, plural subject -q-a-);

      Coyote was their chief. They hunted for jack-rabbits; and then a

      gathered together. ""What is it?"" they said. And then Coyote said,

      That which we have been burning as fire is not real fire, and what
      we eat we always eat raw. I t would be very good if we find out

      cooked, it would be extremely good if we ate it,"" said Coyote. As

from the sky."" To that one, Chicken Hawk, ""You are accustomed
to be flying about,"" said Coyote. ""Yes,"" said Chicken Hawk.
And then he flew up into the air. Then, having done so, off over
the earth he flew; then from a distance back hither to them he returned.
   And then Coyote said, ""Go aheadl you Crow, fly up into the air.""
""Yes,"" said Crow; then off he flew. He went, and it happened to
him in like manner, over the earth he went and flew; from there he
also turned round hither, hither towards them, and he also arrived
where they were. All those provided with feathers were used up,
then only that Fish was left. Coyote said, ""Have you feathers, then,
so as to fly? Go ahead! try to fly,"" said Coyote to him. ""Yes,"" said
the Fish. Then up into the air he flew. Coyote said, ""Do you all
follow him with your eye!"" Those watched his flight closely, as
upward toward the sky he flew, then they lost sight of him. There,
then, they were waiting for him; then, after a while, he arrived.
""Hurry up and tell what you saw,"" said Coyote. ""Way off at the
edge of the land it looks as though fires were burning,"" said the Fish.
""What did I say?"" said Coyote. ""Let us go to fetch that fire from
those who are having it as fire. This of ours that we cause to burn is
no real fire,"" said Coyote. ""Yes,"" said they all. ""Let us, then, go to
fetch that fire.""
   And then all started out towards the setting sun. Coyote led
them along; they stopped to camp over night while on their way.
At that place Coyote said, ""Go ahead! you Humming-bird, fly up
into the air, and then go and see that which is burning."" After he
had said it, that Humming-bird flew up into the air. Though having
done so, he did not see the (fire), and returned without result. Then
that Coyote said, ""Go ahead! you Fish, fly up again into the air.""
And then that Fish flew up into the air; then, after a while he came
back. Then that Fish said, ""Now it is near."" Then they started
off again; again they camped over night while on their way. Now that
camp was very near towards which they were going. And then
that Coyote said, ""All of you will arrive (and be) distributed in each
house. I for my part shall arrive and go into the chief's house.
And then you shall not eat all of what has been given to you,"" said
that Coyote, ""(but) shall put some of it in your knees. Then one
night we shall have a hand-game with them. I shall seize fire with
my hair with which this cedar-bark tinder of mine is tied; when
morning comes, I shall be signalling by leaning back and forth over
that fire, then you shall all be ready to start off."" ""All right,"" said
they.

          Then they started off again downward. On the mountain ridge
       next to the (camp) they sat and watched bush-fires that had been
       made (by those that had fire). After they had done so, having
       returned home, (these) caused it to rain on the bush-fires that they
       had made; then all those fires went out. And then, when they had
       sat there, (Coyote and those with him) set off towards the camp. Now
       there they arrived. Coyote said, ""We are visiting around in various
       camps without particular purpose, having come from our land.
       Go ahead! play, then, a hand-game with us,"" said that Coyote as he
      stood and talked like a chief. ""Go ahead! then these fellow-men of
       mine throughout your houses will enter one by one, in each of your
       houses,"" said Coyote.
         That Coyote arrived at their chief's house. They prepared mush
       out of cedar-berries for Coyote; Coyote ate heartily. Then the
      hand-game took place; they gambled with Coyote and his companions.
      And then those (who possessed fire) said, "" I t seems that Coyote has
      come to get our fire from us."" ""No,"" said Coyote, ""we are engaged
      in traveling around without particular purpose over the land; we are
      not in need of fire. We also possess fire, so that you are not alone
      in having fire."" Then the hand-game took place; they gambled
      with Coyote and his companions during the night. Then, when it
      dawned, Coyote did just as he had said, he bent back and forth over
      the fire. ""Oh, it looks as though Coyote is about to take our fire,
      seeing that he is bending back and forth over the fire,"" said those
      camping there. ""No,"" said Coyote, "" I do so without purpose, when
      playing very fast,"" said Coyote.
         And then those companions of Coyote were ready; what that one
      had said to them, just in that manner they acted. And then Coyote
      stuck his tinder into the fire. Having done so, he jumped far away
      and whooped. After so doing, he very quickly ran through there
      in front of the people, moving his head from side to side. ""Oh, I am
      giving out,"" said Coyote, as he was running and carrying the fire.
      ""Go ahead! you Bluejay take it and carry it along,"" said Coyote.
      So then that Bluejay took the fire and carried it along. ""Oh, I am
      giving out. One of you now will take it and carry it along,"" said
      Bluejay. Coyote again took it and carried it along. Then at that
      place (those who were pursuing) killed Bluejay, Coyote's companion.
      They tore him to pieces and threw his body-parts about in different
      directions. Then they said, ""You shall be a bluejay."" In his
      knees they found pine-nuts which he had hid there.

  And then through there they pursued Coyote and his companions.
Then, after a while, when his companions had been used up too,
Coyote said to that Road-runner, ""Go ahead! you take and carry
along this fire."" And then Road-runner took and carried it along;
he tore apart his feet (so that they left tracks) in different directions;
those who were in pursuit of them lost track of Road-runner. Then
they tracked him back and forth in different directions.25 ""(He is)
under this,"" said they, as they ran hither and thither in different
directions. Those companions of Coyote built a fire up on the
mountain. ""Would that they would look up this way!"" said Coyote's
companions. And then one of those looked towards the mountain.
""Oh, what is that there on the mountain? Oh, it is something burn-
ing,"" said they. ""Let us cause rain to fall on it,"" said they. Sure
enough, then, black clouds gathered right over that place. ""Oh,""
said Coyote's companions, ""it is going to rain upon us."" And that
Coyote then said, ""Let us keep some of the fire hidden."" As soon
as Coyote had spoken, he covered some of the fire. All of that fire
(which was uncovered) went out; all of them, his companions, got
wet. And then that fire (which was covered) nearly went out.
  And then Coyote said, ""You Jack-rabbit, who always sit out in
the open, go ahead! hide this fire."" That Jack-rabbit sat on his
haunches over that (fire) out there in the rain. ""Did I say (it should
be done) in that way?"" said Coyote; having taken up his bow and
arrows, he acted as though about to shoot him. Then that rain
stopped; and then the Jack-rabbit hopped off away from the (fire).
Now that (fire) was very red.
  Then Coyote asked all bushes and said, ""Are you accustomed to
burn even when wet?"" "" I never burn when wet,"" said all those
bushes. Then only that sagebrush was left. To it Coyote said,
""Are you accustomed to burn when wet?"" ""Yes, I am accustomed
to burn even when wet."" said the sagebrush. And then Coyote
built a fire out of the sagebrush. ""There shall be fire in all of you
bushes,"" said Coyote. So then all bushes got to contain fire.
   Did any of you hear something make a noise on the other side?

                      pronounced with simultaneous closure and subsequent
                      simultaneous release of oral point of articulation and of
                      glottis. They have a snappy effect altogether different
                      from the cracked effect of the glottalized stops and
                      affricatives of many West Coast languages. T h e y are

   Then Porcupine came to life again. "" R e d pine, start growing

on to the red pine, and the pine grew up. Then that meat got to be
up there on the pine. Porcupine was sitting on the pine tree (with)
all the meat. Now Coyote arrived at his own house. Then he told
(his folks), "" I have really killed a buffalo,"" said he then. "" I have
really killed a porcupine too. I have put thein away."" ""Yes!""
said they, (wife) and children. So they all repaired to that place,
and then they hunted for (the game). The youngest one was looking.
Then Porcupine, ""Would that he might look upward this way!""
thought Porcupine. So he looked. ""Oh!"" said he and told (them).
Then they all looked. Porcupine was sitting up there on the red pine
with the meat. And then Coyote (said), ""Throw some of that down
to your younger brothers."" ""Yes,"" said Porcupine. ""You all will
be ready to catch it, but that one, (the youngest,) you will put off
apart further away. Now, then, get ready to catch it!"" Coyote said.
"" E v e n if but a bit of the neck (throw) down!"" And then he threw
it down, and the neck killed everyone of them.","[512, 513]"
"         (2) F R E E ADVERBS. The adverbs of free position may be classified
      into temporal adverbs, local adverbs, adverbs of degree, and modal
      adverbs. They are employed either as true adverbs (e. g. qi'arjwt.
      ya""a YESTERDAY DIE(D) ), often serving as bases for postpositional
      suffixes (e. g. qwa'utuyvia- OFF-TO, THE OTHER WAY < qwau- O F F ) ;
      or, in part, as verbs (this is particularly true of local adverbs, e. g.

iyiR INDEED, TRULY. This common adverb tends to amalgamate
   loosely with preceding personal pronouns, independent or enclitic.
   Thus, rii' iyiR is generally heard as m'iyiR; imi- iyiR appears as,
   not i'm 'iyiR, but imi'tyiR (in general, -i- iyiR becomes iyiR); -ay
   iyiR often coalesces to -ay g'iR (stopped g is sometimes heard for
   y in others of these cases also). Present forms tend to take on
   preterital significance with iyiR. Examples are:
      rii' 'iyiR nfna'c i I indeed dream-present, I did indeed dream
      imi' ιχίτ uywaro""' thou indeed anim. sing.-is, you indeed have
          always been

      imi'ntcu'aq• 'iy'ir ivi'yu     thou-interrogative -it (vis.) indeed
         drink-momentaneous, you did drink it
iyqi"" INDEED (Ute form of iyiR, sometimes used also in Paiute)
'ja'i , 'oq'i' (objective inanimate invisible demonstrative in origin;
   see § 42, 9 and § 43, 5) frequently used adverb (generally post-
   verbal) of quite elusive significance. I t seems to have emphasizing
   force. I t is particularly common after iyiR (see above); with pre-
   terital -tea- and -γωα- (§ 19, 1); after gerund -t si- (§ 55, 1, a); in
   irrealis forms (§ 33, 1), particularly such as indicate unfulfilled
   desire (WOULD THAT . . . !); after futures in -pa - (§ 32, 4);
   after -ml·- ALREADY (§ 30, 13); and after substantive verbal -aq a-
   IT is (§ 56, 3). In many cases it seems to turn absolute or present
   verb forms to past tense forms (probably only by implication).

away from there, he kept sniffing. "" Right here it smells like a young
woman,"" said he then, "" b u t this here where you have been sitting
smells old."" Skunk asked her. And then, when he had asked her,
(she said), "" W h a t is it that you were asking? They say that your
elder brother has died, the Owl, that indeed is what his widow was
saying, and then the two of them were on their way."" ""Yes, why is
it that you did not let me know? Why is it that she has taken away
from me my brother's son?""
   And then the Skunk started off in yonder direction and followed
them in their tracks. Now the two of them were going yonder. And
then the young woman looked back. He was coming very close to
them. And then he caught up with them. When he had caught up
with them, he embraced her, he kept hugging her. And then she
took her lice and threw them away on a rock. "" Stop this that you
have been doing! Over there are mountain sheep,"" (said she). And
right there were mountain sheep, and they were not far away. So
he put his skunk robe about the young woman, and then, when he
had done so and after he had gone, she put that blanket of his around
a wild-rose bush, and having so done, the two of them went off again.
""Stay right here,"" said he, and so saying he started off in yonder
direction. He crouched up to the (mountain sheep). He shot at
them, he killed them all, and when he had finished killing them off,
he came back to the same place. And she was still (apparently) sitting
when he went and looked. And then, when somewhat further on his
way back, he closed his eyes. Again he proceeded to hug the (bush),
there he hugged it for quite a while. And then he opened his eyes to
see a rose bush that had a robe thrown about it. ""Oh, oh! what is
the matter! Don't, you fighter with your finger nails!"" While he
kept hugging it, he tore to pieces the blanket that was thrown thereon.
The young woman was not there, nor her boy. And then he went
to his mountain sheep that he had killed, his arrows were lying scattered
about in every direction. He went over there and picked them up.
Lice were stuck on to his arrows, to the arrow-points. And then
Skunk was angry. ""Where then would they be remaining?"" said
Skunk then. When he had said this, pepedit. Then, as they were
looking, podex Viverrae kept coming on as in a cloud of darkness.
""Move along fast, my dear boy,"" said she then, as it was coming near.
And then podex Viverrae caught up with them. And then it killed
both of them.

said), ""Look way off yonder, I have not been dreaming well. Some-
where perhaps your aunt is lying down, that is what I think."" But
then they did not find any one, but the youngest of them, the younger
brother, told about it. ""Off yonder,"" said the youngest of them,
and then they returned home to their father, and their father asked
them. "" T h a t one is really telling about it,"" said they about the

He went straight down under the ground. There came to view her
body bent sideways. "" W h a t is it that has happened to you?"" (said
Badger). "" I t is Skunk that has done so to us."" They were swollen
up with blood. He started in to sing:
                        ""Ϊ'ΓΪΓΪ'ΓΪ Ϊ'ΓΪΓΪ'ΓΪ,""and then he looked at them, he doctored them. Cum eis copulavit, 16
and then they revived. "" W e indeed did not take any of his things,""
(said she).17 "" I did not mean that sort of thing,"" (said Badger).
Everything that was on her was gone through, (he refusing each of
them). And then, ""Vulvam meam?"" (said) she. "" J u s t that!"" said
Badger. ""Yes! Ϊ'ΓΪΓΪ'ΓΪ Ϊ'ΓΪΓΪ'ΓΪ."" Cum ea copulavit. ""Good-bye,""
said he, and, so saying, he dived back again into his hole. And then
he asked them (whom they were bound for). "" W e two are on our
way to that one, to that Chicken Hawk we are going, since this one's
father has died."" Then he said, ""Yes, do you two go ahead and
proceed straight on your way to him."" And then they went off on
their way.
   There the two of them arrived where many people were encamped.
"" W e indeed are on our way to Chicken Hawk,"" (said she). ""Yes,
he lives up above yonder,"" (they were told). And then she went
there and arrived at that place. I t was Coyote whom she found to
be chief. An old woman was sitting there, (the mother of Chicken
Hawk). Coyote heard about her. "" W h y is it that she is carrying
 (her boy) along to another place? I t is right here that the two of
them should have come,"" said he then, having heard about them.
Coyote had been killing many jack-rabbits. ""Take one of them over
to her then,"" (said he to one of his people). And then, having taken
many of them over, he threw them down there where she was. She
merely sat and looked at them, so he picked them up and went back

with them. And then Coyote said, "" W h a t was the trouble with her?""
""Indeed, she did not take them,"" (said his messenger). "" Go again and
take some."" So he again took some of them and went off again.
Going up to her he threw them down again, but once more she just
sat and looked at them. So again he picked them up and went back
again. ""Yes,"" (said Coyote), ""she is still feeling lonesome."" When
the two of them, (she and her boy), had arrived (at Chicken Hawk's
house, she said), ""We, indeed, are on our way to that one, as the one
that was father of this one said."" And then the old woman said,
"" Yes, it is not here that he is accustomed to sleep, it is over there at
the entrance into a big rock that he is accustomed to lie.""
   And then the young woman started off in yonder direction over
there to the big rock. She made round holes in the rock to serve as
steps. She pecked at the place where he was accustomed to lie.
Proceeding there, she arrived at that place. In there the rabbit
blanket was lying on his bedding. And then she went down back again,
and when she got there, she felt proud. Now the hunters of jack-
rabbits came back, each to his own home. A boy came along shooting
the jack-rabbits after the two of them had arrived there. The boy
came last of all, shooting along. He was accustomed to kill just one,
and right there at his mother he threw it. She picked it up. And
when he had gone home, he commenced to suck (his mother's breast).
He looked cross at that (other) boy. The young woman was sitting
and looking at him. (The old woman) took out the intestines from
the jack-rabbit and roasted it in the ashes. I t was roasted, it was
roasted after a little while. And then she took it out of the ashes,
she took out the (jack-rabbits) which had become numerous in there.
And then she looked at them and they were steaming very much there.
Now Chicken Hawk cried out and grabbed one of them in his talons,
and he flew off to his house, holding in his talons the jack-rabbit that
he had taken. There Chicken Hawk arrived at his house. He
entered and went asleep. And then the young woman, when it had
become a little dark, went to that place. Having gone off yonder,
she arrived there and caught hold of him. Then Chicken Hawk
cried out:
                          ki· ki· ki· ki· ki·' k.'
Coyote and his people were gathered together during the night and
smoking, Coyote being their chief. And then he heard (Chicken
Hawk's cries). "" Something has happened to my friend who has been
caught hold of,"" said he. He seized his quiver and took his arrows.

"   (2) VERBS OF SAYING. The corresponding generalized usage of
verbs of saying finds less ready analogy in English. First of all,
ai-, particularly in its usitative form, frequently means το MEAN,
TO REFER το rather than literally το SAY, e. g.:a'inicu'a ij 'a'imi that-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is that
     what he is wont to say? he does not mean that
i'i'ijai a'imi-ka' this (anim.)-obj. sav-usitative-perfective, has been
    always referring to this one   F o r ai-   . . .nia-   τ ο THINK, s e e § 19, 2, d .
  Examples of ai- as generalized verb of sound and mental operation,
the precise nature of the reference being clear from the context, are:Mi iy'ir 'a'imi I indeed am wont to say = always have that dream
aya'n iyidsiTjiv a'ik-.i what-do-momentaneous-gerund-he (inv.) says,
  what happened to him that he says so? = what has happened to
  him to make him cry?

  the same manner = (everything that is) there (at the house) will
  be making the same sounds as ordinarily (so that people will not
  know it has been abandoned)   A number of verbs of sound or mental operation consist of ai- το
SAY preceded by some more specific word, e. g.            ampa'(i)yania-

"  (2) USE OF SUBJECTIVE FORMS. The subjective enclitics may be
used as the subject of a non-subordinate verb or as the object of an
imperative (§ 52).     The animate dual -' . . .πιϊ-, however, of
which examples will be given separately, functions only as a subject,
sometimes also as a possessive. Subjective examples of enclitic
pronouns, attached both to verbs and to other parts of speech, are:im'yuntcar'oani    did I take a drink?
Ι/α'α'ίχυ-η ίχα' 'aαϊ' would that I might die!
a'ivwmi p\ni'kaiva     now-I shall-see

a'a'{i)Yuqwa(i)'yim""''i they (inv.) are good
7nwava'ami qari'p 'iya' there-they (inv.) dwelt   In connection with the use of second person singular -' certain
peculiar contraction phenomena are to be noted. Ordinarily the
pronominal -' does not amalgamate with a ' in the last syllable of the
word to which it is attached (e. g. from -ywa'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO
is formed ηα'υ,'ψναίχινα'αί'' GO THOU AND HANG THYSELF!), but in
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean    Language
           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    185other cases such amalgamation takes place, so that no specific pro-
nominal element is apparent at all. This is notably the case with
interrogative -ru'a-, e. g.:
im'yiro'"" art thou drinking? ( < -ro'a- + -'; not -ro'a')
cu(w)a'ru' nyn o'c C maybe you'll dream
   Probably this difference of treatment has something to do with the
difference between inherent and accessory ' (§ 15, 1). Furthermore,
the pronominal       is lost in certain cases, notably after qatcu- NOT,
after demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5), and before ai- τ ο SAY and ani- τ ο
DO; a final -a is then elided before following a-. Examples are:
qatcu' n a 'n ia'ap-A not-thou say-negative, do not say anything
a'i(y) igiT a'iimA that-obj.-thou indeed say-usitative, you are indeed
   wont to say ( = ai-a- iy'ir, cf. a'ian iy'ir that-I indeed)
u w

   like that, you said ( = -mia- ai-)
Tti'ani   aik-A     too-bad-thou say, (it is) too bad (that) you say
   ( = -n ia-' ai-, cf. Tfi'anian aik-ϊΑ it is too bad t h a t I say)
mani'riumpanti'yw      aik -A that-do-momentaneous-future-participle-
   him (inv.)-thou say; being about to do thus to him, you say ( =
   -Tjwa- ai-; for combination of enclitic pronouns, see § 41, 2, a, end)
αχα'ηίχαί 'anik -.i what-do-subordinating-thou do? why do you do
   so? ( = -jfoi' *ani-)
  The third person inanimate enclitic pronouns (-aqa- and -' . . .q wa-)
are very often used, as in English, in an impersonal sense, particularly
in references to the weather. Examples are:
u7)wa'(i)y'iaq A it is raining (said by one who sees it raining)
ui)wa'(i)'yiqwA    it is raining (said by one who does not see it rain)
nia'va n-i'aq-WA it will blow
arja""q• νυηαϊ   who-it (inv.) then? who is it, then?
  Subjective examples of animate dual -' . . .m l- are:
mami qa 'y'tmi they 2 (vis.) sing (not equivalent to qa 'y'imi they 2
  inv. sing, as ma'mi implies visibility, but to qa 'yiam'i they 2 sing;
  in mami qa 'y'imi duality is expressly indicated by -' . . .mi-,
  in qa 'yiami merely implied because of singular form of verb)
mam'Cntca' pi'jn'tci'imi they 2 (vis.) arrived
tami'ntca' pipi'tci'mi   we 2 (inclus.) arrived

of transitive verbs, as subjects of subordinate verbs, and as possessives.
For their use in subordinate verb forms, see § 55, 1. Possessives,
exemplified only in noun forms, are treated below (4). Examples
of enclitic pronouns in a properly objective sense are:qu'qwi'tu'acuyaywanoani          would t h a t they (indef.) would shoot me!
    I wish I would get shot!

              SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                          187   (4) USE OF OBJECTIVE FORMS AS POSSESSIVE PRONOMINAL EN-
CLITICS. In a possessive sense enclitic pronouns can be used only
with nouns. Inasmuch, however, as such an enclitic, even when
appended to a noun, can have objective (or, in most cases, also sub-
jective) significance, a theoretical ambiguity sometimes results. Thus,
a form like qam'anl HOUSE-OBJ.-I (or ME, MY) may be interpreted
as signifying either MY HOUSE (obj.) or I (DO so AND so το) A HOUSE.
The form of the whole sentence or the context generally removes
the ambiguity. In practice a noun with possessive enclitic is generally
followed by a postnominal article-pronoun, e. g. qani'an am MY-
HOUSE (OBJ.) IT, in which case no ambiguity is possible. Examples
of possessive enclitics are:purjqu'm my horse; qu'tcu'mpuyquTjwini my cattle (lit., buffalo-pets)
dci'ni   pA'tca'n-     cc'RI to*to'q wa'ar/q'i   this-me mocasin-my    it   patch
    (distributively)- for, patch these moccasins of mine for me
fiyi'virarm    friend-our (dual inclusive); you and I who are friends
    (song form)
pivi'ararjwa       mother (distributively)-our (inclus.), our (inclus.)
   mothers
paa""ami thy aunt; paa'(i)'yami         thy aunt (obj.)
pia'ru'a'm aro""a mother-interrogative- thy is, is it your mother?
pi(y)a'YUM    U'IJWA   mother-your (plur.) she, your (plur.) mother
taya'n a x ituywa yA knee-in-to-his (vis.), into his knee
paml'vqWA his (inv.) elder brother
aru""ana'yiVA be-verbal noun-his (inv.), his being, his property
ari'c υ taywa 'q• am that (inan.) tooth-its (vis.) it, that tooth of it
yaya 'ma q-A end-at-its, at its end
A'SI'a-(i)ya'Q WA its surface, bark (obj.)
nia 'viy'wa m,· aijA chief-possessed-their (vis.) he, their chief
pi{y)a""am'i their (inv.) mother
   Instead of -am'i- THEIR (vis.) and -' . . .m i- THEIR (inv.) are
sometimes found the corresponding singular forms -αηα-, -' . . .rjwa-.
This takes place, though not always, when the person referred to by
the enclitic pronoun precedes with the plural animate suffix -ψνϊ-
(-TO I-; § 48,1), evidently in order to avoid a double plural. Analogous
phenomena will meet us again (§ 41, 1, e; § 42, 2 and 5). Examples of
this ""number dissimilation"" in possessive forms are:
qum a'rjwia m,· αηΑ ma 'ai>LTjWA             husband-plural-objective-their   he
   ( = them; § 42, 2, end) chief-his (inv.; = their inv.); their-husbands

      ""'a't iywayw'ia'aywA good-possessed-plural-obj.-his (inv.), their (inv.)

         The reflexive possessive -vi- occurs only in objective forms, i. e.
      after objective -a-, -ya- (§ 49, 1); after nominalizing -n a- (§ 25, 3); and
      after postpositions, which are syntactically equivalent to the objec-
      tive (§ 50, 3). The reflexive possessive indicates t h a t the possessor is
      the same person as the subject of the sentence. Ordinarily it refers
      to the third person, but it may also be employed in first and second
      personal references. Examples <)f its use are:

   (5) PLEONASTIC FORMS.        Double (or even more frequent)
expression of pronominal elements is very common in Paiute. Ex-
amples of the repetition of the subjective or objective pronoun, both
pronouns enclitic or one enclitic and the other independent, have
occurred in preceding lists. There is a marked tendency for the
objective enclitic pronoun to attach itself to the verb even if it is
elsewhere expressed in the sentence; in transitive sentences the
enclitic subject seems to be normally attached to the verb only in
combination with the enclitic object (§ 41, 2, a). Particularly char-
acteristic is the employment of enclitic possessives together with
genitives (i. e. objectives) of the corresponding independent pro-
noun, e. g.:n'i'mA pavi'lsini       me my-elder brother
maya'iA ραα'ατ/Λ h i m h i s - a u n t
pi 'xäSiTj'w'im imi'A pigs-thy thee, thy pigs
imi'A paa'i'ami thee aunt-obj.-thy, thy aunt (obj.)
   Pleonasm is abundantly illustrated also in nouns, which are often
anticipated or redundantly referred to by pronouns, independent or
enclitic. Of such usages also examples have already been given.
Particularly frequent is the occurrence of an objective enclitic pronoun
of the third person with an objective noun, e. g. ι SEE-IT HOUSE (OBJ.)
as equivalent of ι SEE HOUSE (OBJ.). In genitive constructions this
is almost the rule, e. g. ραα'ία η.ι qaniar/A AUNT-OBJ.-HIS HOUSE-HER,
HIS AUNT'S HOUSE; also paa'iarjA       qanl.","[202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"
"                              TRANSLATION. 1 9   At that place they had a camp for the hunting of jack-rabbits.
Now a certain one among them gave his wife a beating, and then that
young woman ran off towards the mountain. There Gray Hawk
was dwelling on a snow-covered peak, and with him was his mother.
And then that Gray Hawk went off in yonder direction and there,
right in the middle of the mountain, he found the woman. He re-
turned with her to his house.
   Then those who had a camp for the hunting of jack-rabbits began
to miss the woman, and they called upon the white-breasted one™ (to
find her). Then that one, starting from the edge of the land, looked
all over it; only that mountain peak there was left. When evening
approached, (he returned and) arrived where were those having a
camp for the hunting of jack-rabbits. "" I have not seen her,"" he
said; ""only that snow-covered peak is left,"" said the white-breasted
one. In the morning he went off to look over the snow-covered peak
and on it he found the woman whom Gray Hawk was having as his
wife. He started back home over his former way towards the camp
for the hunting of jack-rabbits. "" What do you all say that you will
do to him?"" said he. ""With Gray Hawk, him who is not easily to
be overcome, dwells that woman. What, then, will you all do to

him?"" said that white-breasted one. (Then someone said,) "" L e t us
call upon Sparrow Hawk!"" ""All right,"" said they, and called upon
that Sparrow Hawk. To him they said, "" Go ahead! lead the woman
away from Gray Hawk. After you have done so to her, you shall
have her as your wife,"" said they who had a camp for the hunting
of jack-rabbits.
   Then there in the doorway Sparrow Hawk was sitting and kept
singing, "" What say you all that you will do to that Gray Hawk, him
who is not easily to be overcome, who has great power? Will you
slay him?"" said he, as he sat there in the doorway. Only that body
of his is doing so, sitting and singing, but his soul went off and arrived
at that mountain peak where his elder brother was. Then, upon
arriving, he took hold of the woman and said, "" She here is mine, having
been given to me for a wife. Do you, then, without saying anything,
give her up to me!"" "" I shall not give her to you; she is mine, having
been taken up by me for a wife,"" said Gray Hawk. "" Do not say that,
say I, but quickly let her go! She is mine, having been given to me for
a wife, that is what I say."" "" B u t she is mine, having been taken by
me for a wife. Why, then, shall I give her up to you?"" ""W T ithout
saying that, quickly let go! Otherwise I shall slay you,"" said Sparrow
Hawk. "" All right, by no means shall I let her go. I do not care if
you kill me,"" said Gray Hawk, as he held her by her arm. That
Sparrow Hawk was holding her by her other arm.
    ""All right,"" said Gray Hawk. ""If you are angered, in what way
•would the land appear, say you?"" And then that Sparrow Hawk
 said, ""When I am angered, the land would become filled with fog.
 And as for you?"" ""When I am angered, the mountains would all go
 up in dust, then all would be a level space,"" said that Gray Hawk.
 And then Gray Hawk said to his mother, "" Should I be killed, you shall
 boil all of my body."" And then he wrenched off one of (the young
 woman's) arms. And between them both they divided her body,
 (each pulling her to himself). After they had done so, that Sparrow
 Hawk killed Gray Hawk, and after he had gathered together all
 parts of the woman's body, all that had formed her body, he caused
 her to appear as she had been before.
    Then that mother of Gray Hawk boiled him. Then, when it
 dawned upon the earth, from the sky was heard a noise as of flapping
 wings, and on the rim of the bucket (wherein he had been boiled) he
 lit; thereon he sang, "" I shall go and slay Sparrow Hawk,"" said he.
 And then that mother of his said, "" Do you speak of a stranger, of one

what I say; (but) that one killed me."" Then towards the camp for
the hunting of jack-rabbits he proceeded. "" O h l Gray Hawk comes
to attack (us),"" said those having a camp for the hunting of jack-
rabbits, as they ran away; but that Sparrow Hawk lay with his wife,
as though nothing were happening, and sang. T h a t Gray Hawk
swooped down upon him to hold him down, swooped down in vain.
After doing so, he caught hold of that woman; both of them tried to
tear her away from each other. And then that Gray Hawk struck
above him with his wing, but merely grazed his head. "" Nearly, my
elder brother, did you kill me,"" (said Sparrow Hawk). And then their
mothers led them away in different directions. "" D o you act as though
you were strangers to each other?"" said the two old women, as they
held on to their sons.
  Did any of you hear something make a noise on the other side?21              6.   C O Y O T E SETS THE PARTURITION CUSTOMS.  ccna qwaviyayw          ai)A     m ,v„'·

      out loud."" ""All right,"" said Coyote.
          All set off flying towards the sky; westward, then, they flew off
      whither they were bound. Coyote flew back and forth around them.
      Then their chief said, ""Let us pull out his feathers. By doing that
      (which he is doing) he will cause us to be found out."" And then they
      took hold of him under the sky and pulled out his feathers. Down came
      Coyote, making a whizzing noise; he fell upon the earth and lay
      senseless. Then, after a while, he came to. He saw mush. ""Oh!""
      said he, ""my friends, it seems, have given me mush,"" he said, as he ate
      it.
          Then, after a while, when he had finished eating it, he felt as though
      a cold thrill went through his head; and then he touched his head.
      ""Oh!"" said Coyote, ""is it my own brains that I have been eating?""
      said he. He tried to voinit. Coyote got angry (and said), ""Now I
      will follow in their tracks."" Coyote journeyed westward, he camped
      several nights on his way. Then, after a while, he heard them as
      they moved along singing. ""Coyote,"" they said, ""there in the midst
      of the people lies the woman whom you like."" ""All right,"" said Coyote.
      There at that old camping place he arrived. He looked for the
      woman and, in so doing, found her. ""What, then, shall I do to her?""
      said Coyote. He got on top of her, stood stamping on her stomach.
      Just as he did so, that baby fell out.
          ""What, now, shall I do with him?"" said Coyote. And then he

swallowed him, and he turned back towards his own country. Again
he camped several nights on his way; he had a stomach-ache. "" I n
that way will it always be with a woman,"" said Coyote. And then
he heated stones on the fire. After doing so, he hung on to a cedar
limb; as he did so, the baby dropped down. Then he went off to a
considerable distance for an armful of wood. He arrived, built a
fire of it. He lay on top of the bed made of rocks that he had heated;
he drank warm water. Then he made a head-scratcher and scratched
his head with it. "" I n this way shall it be with a woman when she
has given birth to a child,"" said Coyote.","[389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399]"
"   This assimilation takes place also after a syllable containing u (o):
-TU to make + -y'i- present tense           a{i)ya'ruyum     I make a turtle
-yim aywit uywa- away from                  uyu'm aywit ux fVA away from it

                                               tion
  Only infrequently does ϊ fail to assimilate to u. This seems to
occur sometimes when a glottal stop separates the vowels, e. g.rii'u'nantux-WA    OPPOSITE TO M E ;        yi'u-, yi'u-    LEG,   more often
yu'u-, yo'o-.
   (g) Consonantizing   before nasals.  This takes place, though less
frequently, under the same circumstances as the analogous con-
sonantizing of i (see 2, c above), but after a c:

( 4 ) MODIFICATIONS OF O:
  (a) Semi-unrounding.   Between two α-vowels an ο is sometimes
semi-unrounded and dulled in quality to a sound approximating that
of a itself. This quality appears to be identical with that of the
ω referred to above (1, c). Examples are:
-oayduywa-        around                 ace'ayduxwA    around it
oa- back                                 ρ/ϊ&α'ωαγαίρϊγα' had a          sore
                                           back
   (b) Palatalization. Rather infrequently we find ο palatalized or
""uinlauted"" to a true ö (mid-front-rounded, probably ""wide"")
after y:
{i)yovi-      mourning dove              (i)yö'vdcuA'isii}w'i little mourn-
                                            ing doves
  In Ute ö (both wide and narrow varieties) is found as the regular
correspondent of Southern Paiute ο (e. g. Ute οα'φι SALT: Southern
Paiute οα'φι).
   (c) Assimilation to u.      Sporadically ο is assimilated to an u of the
following syllable:
poro- several travel                     poru'qupiya'     several started out
  The compound form -puru-, like certain other examples of o-u
alternation, belongs rather to vocalic "" a b l a u t "" than to the purely
phonetic phenomena here discussed (see § 17, 7, a).
( 5 ) MODIFICATIONS OF U (alternating with O):
  (a) Consonantizing to w. Passage into the corresponding semi-
vowel w, when standing before a vowel, sometimes takes place:
u- demonstrative stem                    w'a'xava 'q WA into it
ui-Tjwa-yanti-, oi-ywa-yanti-     can-   wi'tpvayantimpaywi  in a canyon
   yon
   (b) Assimilation to i. An unaccented u is rarely assimilated to an
i, ι of the following syllable:
-c u- enclitic element ""also""            y.m""u'RU'qwayd uac m i           as
                                            though under them too

    (c) Unrounding to ϊ. An unrounded u, i. e. ϊ, sometimes develops
after iy or before y, also quite frequently immediately before i.
This secondary ϊ may be further developed to i, ι (see 3, b). Examples
are:
tsi- with the point of a stick +    tsi' (y)i'm-uxwiplyaiyarjA      kept
   yum'mu- to poke                      poking him

   with                                 place, passive pederast
   (d) Assimilation   to ϊ.   Between two ϊ- vowels, u is rarely assimi-
lated to ϊ (ü):
ta 'i- shirt + -ru- to make            ta'""irüijqi'p'iyaiAxqaaijA made it
                                          into a shirt for him
   (e) Opening to o. Before, less frequently after, an a, u is some-
times broadened out to an open a:
ua- demonstrative + -ya- objec-        'οα'ΪΛ   modal adverb
   tive
-ru'a- interrogative                   iw'rjuntcar'oani did I take a
                                         drink?
-urai- toward                          αηα""oral'p'iya went towards him
moyoa- soul                            ?noyo'cupi soul
  As the last example shows, two successive o- vowels both tend to
develop to ο when one of them is so modified (cf. f).
  An original u (o) tends to become opened to ο before and after -y-.
This is particularly true of the group -uyu- {-oyo-), which seems to
develop regularly to -oyo-; e. g. yoyo- ΤΟ COPULATE WITH, toyο'αφ!
RATTLESNAKE.     Sometimes comparison with Ute, in which primary
ο appears as ö (Ute ο is an open form of u, o), is necessary in such
cases to determine whether Paiute ο is primary or developed from o.
   (f) Assimilation to o.     An u (ο)- vowel assimilates to ο before a
syllable containing o:
to-   black                            to""ovan'narjqA        black  goose;

  Infrequently u is assimilated to ο by the ο of a preceding syllable
(contrast 4, c):
mano-      all + -qu-   objective       man-o'q-(w)o-      (also heard   as
                                          man-o'q-u-)
   (g) Conscmantizing before nasals. Infrequently u loses its vocalic
nature when standing between q and y, appearing as syllabic fl (cf. 2,
c; 3, g):
-qu-   subordinating suffix +          yo'vUcuAtsiyaqj/yumi    being-a-

   (1) VOCALIC CONTRACTION. Long, less often short, vowels some-
times result from the contraction of two short vowels or of a long
and a short vowel. The vowels may be either of the same or of
different qualities. We shall take up the examples according to the
quality of the resulting product.
  (a) Vowels contracting to a- (a).      The most common source of a
contracted a· is ο + a:
-ntcu'a- interrogative + aya- he       a'intcu'a yA that-inter.- he
-ntcu'a- Η—aqa- it                     imi'ntcu'a q-A thou-inter.- it
-ya- objective + -aya- his             tümpa'(i)ya yA his mouth (obj.)
-xwa- preterit suffix -|—aya-          ya'a'ixwa yA he died
-na- verbal noun suffix + -aya-        ora'n a yA which he dug up
-vu(y)a- usitative Η—aq-a- it          NA*ei'm'°'iaimya-q A keeps for-
                                          getting it
     Less commonly α· results from a- + o:
-mpa -    future + aya-    he          pAxqa'yqiyumpa y'am ini he will
                                         kill thee for me
qa - to sing + -aq a- imperative       qa-'q-A sing!
  enclitic
  Often, but not necessarily, di contracts to a·:
tümpa- mouth + νγαρ ϊ- what            tümpa-'yap-ϊ     bit and bridle
  enters
pdi- perfectly                         pa-'yqwi'oq oitci   perfectly round

            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                        17  Also ϊα is not infrequently heard as a·, a:
-ψοϊ- animate plural + -α- ob-        -ψνα-,    -ywa-
   jective
-yi- present tense + -arja- he        -ya r/A
-ηφ- indirective                      kitTjqa'pA        don't laugh!
   + -a'pa-  negative
   An au, itself usually contracted from a + u (see b), is sometimes
further contracted to a· before qw, ijw, or ρ the labial vowel u being
absorbed, as it were, into the following labialized consonant but
leaving its quantitative value behind in the lengthening of the pre-
ceding a. Examples are:
na-urjwai- to hang oneself          na^ywaiywa'ai'' go hang thyself!
riivna-urjwa- to snow               nivwa'ywa p ly a it snowed
nauqwirjqi-   to       fight        na 'q wiyqi-
    (< na-yuqwi-yqi-, see § 13, 5, b)
  (b) Vowels contracting to ai, au.     This results when organically
distinct α and i, or u, combine:
quna- fire -|—i'ni- possessed         quna'i'niaraytVA    our      (inclus.)
                                        fire (obj.)
ma- t h a t -|—up-a'- in (such a)     ma'up-ain      that way
  way
  A long a- + i also contracts to ai. This is because organically
long diphthongs are not allowed in Southern Paiute. E. g.:
cTpu'v^a - cold water -|—in'ni-       ci'pu'v'*'ain intsiyaim-i'   is wont
  possessed                              to have cold water
  Apparently a- + u (o), however, remains as disyllabic a -u, e. g.:
qava·- horse + -wp ama-     like      qava 'op aniani       I (am) like a
                                        horse
  Had qavau- resulted, the above form would have been qava'upamani
(see § § 8 , 2, a; 10, 1).
   (c) Vowels contracting to i, i; i·. The ϊΐ, u, a which sometimes
results from an original ui (see § 3, 5, c) is sometimes heard still
further reduced to i :
-{•ui- causative suffix               na'a'it ip 'iya' made a fire
-r'ui- to become                      tuywa'r'ίηυpiya'   it got dark

18                                  SAPIR   Rarely yi advances beyond yi, yi (see § 3, 3, b) to contracted i:
-rjqi- indirective + -yi- present tuxqvn.""aiyqiir'on'i''  art thou
   tense                             ashamed of me?
   A long i·, not infrequently heard simply as i, i, appears as a con-
tracted product of i + i:
qivi- locust Η—in'i- possessed            qi-'un'inl   my locust
qani- house Η—i'ni- possessed             qani""nini    my house
   (d) Vowels contracting to ϊ·, ϊ. A contracted ϊ· sometimes results
from ϊ + ϊ, itself sometimes reduced from 'iyi (see § 13, 5, b):
fiy'ivw'i- friend                         ti 'vw'ia i)A his friend (obj.)
     Rarely does ϊ result from ϊ + u, which normally gives ir < u +
u:
rii- I + -u(w)a'mi-        in front of    ni'wctmi     in front of me
   (e) Vowels contracting to ii. This diphthong sometimes results
from ϊ + i, ν + i, or iyi (for loss of y, see § 13, 5, b):
cv yi - sugar + -i'ni- possessed          ον'χϋ'ηίηι my sugar
tiyia- deer                               ü'iaRUquatfri deer meat; pa-

   (f) Vowels contracting to o·, o. The contracted product a- results
from either ο + ο, assimilated from u + a (see § 3, 5, f):
u- demonstrative stem                    o-'ayd ux'WA around it
  + -oayduywa-    around
or from ο• + u:
po - trail Η—up·a' through               po-'p-a'"" through the trail
   Ordinarily, however, the u in the latter case keeps its distinctive-
ness, e. g. p 3 - ' x u p a ' a THROUGH THE TRAIL.

original ua (oa), ua• (oa·) (see § 3, 5, e) appears also contracted to

   (g) Vowels contracting to oi. This diphthong sometimes results
from ο + i or a- + i, ο being itself sometimes a broadened form of u
after a (see § 3, 5, e):

   (h) Vowels contracting to ο·, υ·. T h e u + u t h a t is frequently found
contracted to ο· (υ ) is either primary or assimilated from ϊ + u (see
§ 3, 3, f). Examples are:

   (i) Vowels contracting to ui.       This diphthong sometimes results
from u + i or ν (ο·) + i:
tuy(w)v-     to cache + -in'ni- pos-     tuy(w)v(-)'in'ninl       my    cached
   sessed                                   things
  (2) VOCALIC LENGTHENING.           Several phonetic p h e n o m e n a m a y be
conveniently grouped under this head.   (a) Secondary lengthening. Very characteristic of Southern Paiute,
as contrasted with Ute, is the secondary lengthening of organically
short vowels. This seems to take place, strangely enough, more
often in unaccented than in accented syllables; it occurs with parti-
cular frequency in initial syllables, though found also medially. T h e
lengthening has neither morphological nor mora-determining (§ 9)
significance. Where advisable to indicate its inorganic character,
the mark of length is enclosed in parentheses, e. g. α(·). Examples
are:

   That, to take the last two examples, we are really dealing with
organic ta- and -ναψνί- respectively, is proved not only by the testi-
mony of the overwhelming preponderance of ta- and -vaywi- in other
forms but also by the treatment, as regards unvoicing, of the vowels
following the o( ). A primary two-moraed a- would have demanded
the incorrect forms: *nwwa'ta-mayaA'p'Cya and *qaru.'va-T)Wltuma-
nayqivA (see § 10, 1).   (b) Pseudo-diphthongal       or -triphthongal    treatment of long vowels
(and diphthongs).       Any long vowel, less frequently secondarily
lengthened vowel, may be pseudo-diphthongized, i. e. weakly rearticu-
lated: a"", i i, Ϊ ', v"" (o u, o""), :>"". Examples will meet us frequently,
so none need be listed here. All organically long vowels, whether
resulting from contraction or not, may be broken up into two short
vowels or even a short and a long vowel or a long and a short vowel;
e. g. organic a·, a"" may be further heard diphthongized to a a, aa·,
aa.    Throughout aa and o- are to be considered as phonetic equival-
ents, similarly for other vowels (e. g. y'i·' or yti"" DOORWAY). Examples
of broken-up long vowels are:-tea- preterit tense Η—αηα- he,          tona'iuatcaayanoA       some one
   him                                     struck him; ovi'nti'qay'wintca-
                                           a rjA he turned into wood
qvp-αηα- to spill water out of the       guv'payap'iya'aik-wA      (he) let
  mouth                                    it spill out of (his) mouth
   Analogously, organic diphthongs may be pseudo-triphthongized;
e. g. ai > aai, oi > ooi, au > aau.     Even secondary lengthening of
the first vowel is sometimes found: o(-)oi < oi. Examples of pseudo-
triphthongs are:
-p'iyai-   remote past                   sotsi'rjuplyaaic-u    again peeped

  (c) Rhetorical lengthening  of vowels. Final vowels, instead of
being elided (see § 7, 1) or unvoiced (see § 8, 1, a), are sometimes,

    Medial vowels are also sometimes lengthened for rhetorical reasons:

   Inorganic vowels frequently develop as glides before certain
consonants. These glides are often heard as full vowels, sometimes
as very weak vowels t h a t may be appropriately written as superiors.
I t will be convenient sometimes, to avoid ambiguity, to indicate
the glide by means of a parenthesis. The a and a which appear as
.glides before i after a guttural consonant preceded by ο or ο have
been already spoken of (see § 3, 2, a).
  ( 1 ) GLIDE i. This appears very frequently, one might almost
say regularly, before y after all vowels but i itself. The resulting
diphthong, however, always sounds briefer, less sustained, than the
organic i- diphthong; it does not count as two morae (see § 9) nor
can it be pseudo-triphthongized (see § 4, 2, b). Examples are:
na-yap a - to appear, look like            na(i)ya'p-a-yup'iya'    appeared

(see § 3, 5, c).
   Here belongs also the not too common appearance of an i- glide
after ϊ (ϊ) or ο before a syllable with i (chiefly before -m- or -tsi-);
cf. the occasional assimilation of ϊ to a following i (§ 3,3, a). Examples
are:
ρϊηι- to see                               pl'ru'kaip'Lya' saw
mi{y)o-   a t a distance +         -tsi-   miyo""HsL- at a little distance

ized spirants or nasals {yw, xw, yw); before -yu-, -xu-\ and before
-vi. I t also appears after ϊ before v. The u- diphthong resulting is
inorganic (cf. above under 1). Examples are:

   Nasalized vowels are fairly frequent in Southern Paiute, less so
than in Ute. They arise from two entirely distinct sources. They
are either reduced forms of vowels + η; or they are due to the assimil-
ating influence of an immediately preceding or following nasal
consonant.

the norm (particularly when the vowel is followed by ?jw); and
regularly in Uncompahgre Ute, where η does not occur at all. Ex-
amples are:αηα- he + -ywantuywa.- at             q 'ywantux wA at him (4· < qcinarjwavi- coyote

   Final vowels are never, except in poetry and in certain infrequent
cases also in prose, preserved as such. They are either wholly or
partly unvoiced (see § 8, 1), or else they are entirely elided or quantita-
tively reduced. The latter processes are operative before words
beginning with a vowel (a glottal stop or breathing preceding an
initial vowel does not take away from the vocalic beginning).
   ( 1 ) E L I S I O N OF FINAL SHORT VOWELS.  A final short vowel of the
ideally complete form of the word is lost, without qualitative or
quantitative trace, before a word beginning with a vowel. A pre-

of the next word; e. g. aruywa a'ip'iya' TO-HIM SAID becomes aruyw

Shamans   Anyone, a man or woman, 113 may be a medicine-man ('medicine-
woman', manma E umpuwaxant""). The power of doctoring is not acquired
by a period of fasting or training in the mountains, but may be acquired
in the ordinary course of life (after puberty and before 30 — 40 years of
age) by dreaming. Every medicine-man has his guardian spirit who helps
him and who is appealed to by one or more songs. Every spirit has his
special songs; these seem to have no intelligible words. Knowledge of
the songs was gained by dreaming of them. One of the most powerful
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes             831of the medicine spirits was the eagle. As soon as the medicine-man
begins his song, the guardian spirit, no matter how far away at the time,
approaches, and from a distance communicates with the medicine-man,
telling him of the whereabouts of the sickness. All this is quite invisible
to the ordinary people about. It is told that in a tepee during the night,
when a medicine-man was doctoring, a sound as of the whirring of an
eagle's wings was heard descending clear down to where the poles meet
on top on the outside. Someone went out to see, but could see no eagle.
It was the medicine-man's eagle guardian that had come to answer the
medicine-man's call. In doctoring the medicine-man would sometimes
sit by the patient (generally at night) and sing his medicine-song; at
times he would get up and sing (no regular dance). Sometimes he sang
alone, sometimes others present sang with him, following his song. In
a very severe case, several medicine-men might be used, each singing
his own song. A medicine-man might give some of his power away to
others, as by giving them his songs. If he ""divides"" his power too much,
he loses in efficacy; thus it happens that some medicine-men, in growing
older, are less able to cure disease. Part of the doctoring consisted of
sucking the point where the pain was most acute. 114
   The disease could be extracted in some visible form. Once Tony saw
a medicine-man show everyone present at the doctoring a colorless
round object like a glass marble as the pain he had extracted. Tony
made fun of him and said that he had merely taken a glass marble to
show the people. Some time after, the medicine-man came over to him
as he was lying in camp and stroked him, saying some more or less
unintelligible words. His folks were there at the time and were greatly
frightened, thinking the medicine-man was taking his revenge and that
Tony would die. But Tony did not die, and within a year the medicine-
man himself died. He was not considered much of a medicine-man.
After this Tony was pointed out by his uncle as a wonderful boy.
   One time Tony, when a young boy, felt so sleepy that he slept during
the last night of the ""cry,"" which was strictly forbidden. Everyone was
talking about it the next morning, when they found out. Some time
after, Tony fell sick. A noted medicine-man then in Arizona (Trumbull
Mountain) was called; he was sleeping then, but got up immediately
and went. The first two nights his doctoring was not very successful;
only the third night did he say that his spirit was coming and that he
was beginning to see. Tony then recovered. He was given a horse in
payment.
832                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
   A medicine-man might be powerful enough to be immune in battle,
even from bullets. There was one medicine-man who had this power;
moreover, any horse he rode could be shot in only one place, the
forehead.
   Once a party of two or three Utes, one of them a medicine-man, were
attacked by a party of cowboys. They put all to flight except the
medicine-man. He dismounted and quietly stood near his horse; they
kept shooting at him, but could not harm him. He shot at them and
killed two or three; the rest galloped off.
   Medicine-men did not bargain for a particular payment before doc-
toring. If they succeeded in curing the patient, they would be paid
anything at all.
   A certain medicine growing along the shores of the Colorado River
could be used to keep away rattlesnakes, who do not like its smell. It
could be attached in a bundle to the boot of a person walking in the
bush; it might also be rubbed on a horse.
   A sick horse could be cured by gashing him and turning him loose.
After a few weeks he would recover.
   One method of curing a horse with a bad sore was to cut a gash in
the skin above the wound and slip in a quarter. After a while the horse
would recover and the quarter could be taken out.
   Medicine-men generally sit down when singing; when dancing they
do so alone, their step consisting of a sort of stamping and shaking of
the body; they did not dance circularly, but back and forth. Their power
was obtained by dreaming, but not away from home.
   A medicine-man that Tony once knew used an eagle feather fan. He
scattered ashes with it on his patients. He began his doctoring by calling
upon Wolf: ""Our father, who made heaven and earth."" This is the only
time he ever heard any Indian make such a prayer.
   One time a small party of Kaibab Paiutes, including Tony and Dick,
who was something of a medicine-man because Mamputs had parted
with some of his power to him, camped for the night at Maä(vu)xarTr
""Brush Lake"" on Kaibab Plateau, a place considered particularly liable
to being haunted by ghosts or evil spirits. They were lying in the tent,
when suddenly right near them they heard a loud sharp whistle that
could not have been made by a bird or any other animal. They imme-
diately thought of a ghost and huddled together in fear. Dick, as
medicine-man, quietly said, ""Let me smoke now,"" and took out his
tobacco to roll a cigarette. (Smoking is here doubtless considered a
charm against evil spirits.) After a while they heard the sound of giggling
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes        833near them; perhaps the ghost was laughing at them for their fear. Soon
also the ringing of horses' bells was heard coming near; they had been
frightened by something. Next morning they were found way down a
canyon, having been scared away from the grazing ground.
    When it was suggested to Tony that Dick himself had made the
sounds in order to have an opportunity for showing off his medicine
power, he scouted the idea, saying that a real medicine-man would never
fool people.
    The medicine-man who cured Tony told of the following experience
he had undergone. Once he was out hunting for game, but met with
little or no success. At last he saw a lot of porcupine tracks that led to
a hole in the ground. He waited for them to come out. At last he saw
them come out and began to chase them. He kept chasing them until
they scampered off into a hole, he following them. One porcupine in
particular always kept just a little ahead of him and kept drawing him
on. At last he found himself in a great open underground country, the
porcupines having disappeared. He saw a man walking along at a
distance and hailed him; he directed him to the camp of the people.
People lived there about as in the upper world, except that they hunted
at night. He tried to do so too but could do nothing. When they
returned from the hunt, they had a lot of buffalo meat. They did not
eat the meat after it was prepared, but merely smelled it and then threw
it away. He picked up some of the meat to eat it, but they cried out to
him, ""Don't, it is excrement."" He did not mind, however, but went
ahead and ate it and found it tasted very good. When he defecated, one
of their men tried to eat his excrement but did not find it to his liking.
During the day these people slept and, as he could see as he walked
around, also copulated in full view. After a while he retraced his steps
and found an exit to the upper world through the hole he had entered.
On returning home he found he had been away quite some time and
that his wife was missing him. It seems the people in that lower world
were porcupines in human form. 115
   Some medicine-men claim to be able to make rain. One Kaibab
medicine-man used to make this claim. Once, when there had been a
long drought, the Indians angrily expostulated with him for not bringing
on rain. He said nothing, but about an hour after there was a very
severe rainstorm, although the sky had looked quite clear. Some Indians
thought it was merely an accident, others credited the rain to the
medicine-man: some jocosely wanted to compel him to stay out in the
rain because he had made them be caught unawares without adequate
834                       X Southern Paiute and Ute
provision for shelter. That day the medicine-man said nothing, but the
next day he claimed that the rain had been caused by his power, though
he had not sung his medicine song or in any other way made visible
use of his power.
   As rattlesnake cure was used päxuntünAv11, a plant growing to the
height of about three feet on the sides of wooded mountains (Kaibab)
with leaves and stalks like carrot. 116 If the root is given to a snake, it
will turn its head. It is often tied in little bundles, one to each ankle, to
keep snakes away. When one is bitten, he chews at the root and puts it
on the wound, when it heals. This was tested also in the case of a horse
bitten by a snake. Tony says he was told by Archie Qumala 117 that the
Hopi use the same root as medicine in the snake dance, and that its
odor keeps the snake from biting.
   If one is bitten by a scorpion, a fire is built outside the house. The
wounded person jumps over the fire and, while doing so, calls his own

he does not do so, his wound swells and he is liable to die.","[834, 835, 836, 837, 838]"

    Wolf and his brother dwelt there. When it was early in the morn-
 ing, Wolf sang, "" Go ahead, now! Go to our aunt and ask for grass
 seeds.2 What are you doing, lying down and looking? "" "" All right,""
 said Coyote, ""you are waking up now, but I have been awake long
 ago, ever since it was early morning."" Coyote started off towards his
 aunt's house, on his way to ask for grass seeds. To her there he went
 and arrived at his aunt's house. His aunt was not there in her house,
 only her two sons were sitting there in her house. ""Where is your
 mother?"" said Coyote. ""She has gone to gather seeds,"" said the
two sons of Grizzly Bear; ""she will come back soon,"" thus they said.
    Coyote waited, lying down there in her house, and soon his aunt
arrived. His aunt said, ""Soon you will eat mush,"" thus said his
aunt. ""Affer instrumentum meum masturbationis 1 quod ibi jacet,""
said his aunt, and the children gave their mother instrumentum
ejus masturbationis.      Their mother took it and lay on her back.
Coyote saw her and said, "" My aunt, let me do it for you by means
of this,4 my auntie,"" said Coyote, et cum amita sua copulavit.
""Enough 1"" said his aunt. "" N o , "" said Coyote, and Grizzly Bear put
her claws into his back flesh. ""Enough!"" said Coyote. "" N o , "" said
Grizzly Bear. Coyote got up quickly and ran off. Grizzly Bear arose
and said, ""Look at Coyote's back.""
   Coyote returned home and lay down on his back, did not allow
(Wolf) to see it. His elder brother killed a young deer and brought
home his back flesh. Coyote was ashamed and did not allow his
back to be seen, but Wolf knew. Then he caused him to sleep, and
Coyote rolled over towards him. ""Did I not say so?"" said Wolf.
When (Coyote) rolled over, there was no back flesh of his there; in
its place (Wolf) fastened on the back flesh (that he had obtained).
Thereupon Coyote's back flesh again became as it had been.
   Then Wolf again sang, ""Go on! proceed again to her and carry
this liver for her to eat. Then, having killed her, all things of her
house whereon she has been accustomed to look, all her things shall
you carry off on your back, having killed her,"" said Wolf. ""Yes,""
said Coyote. And then Coyote walked along towards his aunt's
house. Now he arrived there where were her sons—there the two
of them were staying in their mother's house. ""Here,"" said Coyote,""
is your uncle's liver which he says you are to eat."" The two boys
ate it and fell asleep. Coyote killed both of them, and then caused
them to appear to be sleeping.

   After a while their mother arrived home.      Then she said, "" Affer
meum instrumentum masturbationis quod ibi jacet!"" Thereupon
Coyote said, "" T h e y are sleeping,"" said he, and of his own accord
gave it to her. ""Here,"" said Coyote, ""is this liver."" And then
Grizzly Bear ate the liver and fell asleep. (When) she got up, she
jumped and reached for Coyote. Coyote dodged quickly, and then
he killed her. All her things he gathered together, butchered her,
and hung up her bladder on a bush.
   And then he remembered (what Wolf had told him). Thereupon
all her things he carried away on his back, and those things of hers
were (piled up) like a plateau. And then he started off with them
on his back and walked along for a short distance, when he remembered
that bladder which he had hung up. So he went back along the
same road, and reached for it. And then the bladder fell down to
the ground, whereupon Coyote said, "" W h y don't you get a leg?""
said Coyote. ""Walk!"" he said, "" a c t like a person!"" said Coyote.
He went for his bow and brought it back (with) his arrows. And
then he shot his arrows at it (till) they were all used up. Then he
struck at it with his bow. Then he let it go and started off back
towards (his things).
   Coyote heard the bladder talking, "" I will go to call my children
to help."" "" All right,"" said Coyote, and then started back towards
his house. He arrived at his house, whereupon Coyote said, "" J u s t
one thing did I forget of her belongings,""said Coyote. Then Wolf said,
""Go ahead! go and hang yourself with your feet downward."" Coyote
said, "" All right,"" and went off in yonder direction. Then he hung
himself on a cedar branch, remained hanging for one day. Then he
started off for home, and arrived at his house. And then early in the
morning Wolf sang; Wolf said, "" G o ahead, Coyote! Go and hang
yourself again."" ""All right,"" said Coyote, and went off in that
same direction. Then in that same place he hung himself, and again
for one day remained hanging. And then he started off for home
when it was evening, and arrived at his house.
   Always Coyote kept on doing thus. After that Coyote obtained
sticks for arrows from a service-berry bush. He started to return
towards his house, arrived at his house, and threw the arrow sticks
down in a pile. And then Wolf picked the arrow sticks up in a hurry,
pulled off their bark, and made a shirt for Coyote, from the outer
bark he made a shirt for him. And then for himself he made one
from their inner bark, pulled it off. And those (sticks) then turned

into arrows, and then he fastened feathers on to them. Thereupon
said Wolf, "" G o ahead! go and hang yourself."" "" A l l right,"" said
Coyote, and went off in that direction; there Coyote stayed. He
asked all parts of his body, until only that was left—his tail. T h e n
Coyote said, "" Y o u who are always coming after me, have you a
mouth? W h a t did m y elder brother mean when he said, 'Go and
hang yourself'?"" His tail said, "" Y o u know about it, that indeed
you always say. 'Go and hang yourself,' that is not what he really
means. 'Go and get sticks for arrows,' that indeed he always says.""
"" A l l right! stop talking! I know about i t , "" said Coyote.
   Thereupon Coyote obtained arrow sticks, very many of them he
carried on his back, and came home to his house. Then his elder
brother prepared arrows and made very many shirts with which they
were to fight in battle. Now then Wolf sang in the morning, "" G o
ahead!"" said Wolf, "" O Coyote, go and hang yourself again,"" said
Wolf. Coyote understood whereof he spoke; this time he did not
hang, but gathered very many arrow sticks. Now then he saw
lightning way off to the west from the edge of the land.    ""Oh!""
said Coyote, "" I wonder what that means that it appears thus!""
said Coyote. ""W T hy! I wonder if I am getting to be a medicine-
man!"" 6 said Coyote.    "" I have always been a medicine-man,"" said
Coyote.
   And then Coyote returned home, ran along, and arrived at his
house. Then Coyote said, "" I have seen lightning,"" said Coyote, but
his elder brother understood that lightning very well. Thereupon
his elder brother said, "" G o on! go and get arrow sticks."" ""All
right,"" said Coyote. Coyote went off in that direction, there he
gathered arrow sticks. Once again did Coyote see lightning. Coyote
jumped a big distance, and then Coyote returned home, ran along.
Now he was frightened; Coyote arrived at his house. "" O h , m y elder
brother! near at hand now have I seen lightning.""
   And then his elder brother said, "" C o y o t e , go ahead! go once more
to get arrow sticks,"" he said. "" A l l right,"" said Coyote, and went
off in yonder direction. Then at that place he gathered arrow sticks.
Now then lightning got to be very near.         In a hurry Coyote started
home, and arrived at his house. "" O h ! "" said Coyote, "" w h a t are you
doing, lying down and looking? T h a t is not how you should act.""
Although he was about to be attacked (by enemies), that Wolf
kept lying down. And then into a cave the two of them escaped.
   And then Wolf said, "" G o ahead, you! go and fight!"" said Wolf.

""All right,"" said Coyote. "" I t is not you on whom I depend. You
will be acting like that when I go out to fight."" Thereupon Coyote
put on a light gray (shirt) and came out of the cave. ""Oh, it is
Wolf,"" said the children of Rain. "" It is not Wolf, it is Coyote,""
said some among them. Coyote jumped over the canyon, and
returned through the same way.
   And then Coyote said, "" G o ahead! do you now go and fight!""
""All right,"" said Wolf. ""You shall not look at what I do, you shall
keep your eyes covered."" ""All right,"" said Coyote. And then
Coyote lay down, while his elder brother put on a very good (shirt)—
blue it was, and he looked like a soldier. And then he came out from
the cave. ""Oh, that one it is,"" said the children of Rain. Wolf
shot at this end of the line, and then that (end) was mowed down.
Then he shot also at the other end of the line, and in the same way
it fared with them—they were mowed down. Now Coyote was
looking at his elder brother. ""Oh!"" he said, ""those (clothes) it is
that my elder brother has been hiding from me. Would that he
would get shot!"" thought Coyote to himself. Sure enough Coyote's
elder brother was killed. ""Oh!"" said Coyote, ""my elder brother has
been killed,"" said he. The other people took off all his clothes.
   And then they all returned home. ""Right there in his cave let
Coyote die!"" said they, and then they left Coyote in the cave. Then
they returned home. As they were journeying along, dancing took
place; all the clothes they threw on them—on two old women the
clothes they always threw, Wolf's clothes. When it was morning
the two old women, their mothers, went into the dance.
   Now then Coyote said, "" L e t me go and bring my elder brother's
clothes!"" said Coyote. So then Coyote proceeded in their tracks;
exceedingly lean was Coyote. And then, ""Right here I shall put
away bow and arrow,"" said Coyote. Thereupon he did so, the bows
in several places along the trail Coyote put down. While on his
way, following in the track, Coyote became fat. He nearly caught
up with them at the camps that they had just occupied; the fires
were burning yet in several places. ""Oh!"" said Coyote, and then
proceeded on his way, following in the traveled track. And then
Coyote said, ""1 wonder what it is that makes this so,"" said Coyote,
""right here at this little divide!"" said he.
   Now then all parts of Iiis body Coyote set to asking. He asked his
ear, "" W h a t is it that makes this so?"" said Coyote. Thereupon his
ear fluttered, but did not talk. (He asked other parts of his body

 until) only that tail of his was left. Thereupon Coyote said, "" Have
 you a mouth, you that always come behind me?"" said he. And then
 his tail said, ""You are one that knows about it, that indeed you
 always say."" And then Coyote's tail said, ""This, whereof you say,
 'This little divide there,' is the work of two old women,"" said his
 tail. ""The old women are always saying, 'Yonder in his cave let
 him die!' say those two old women."" And then Coyote said, "" That's
 enough, my tail! I knew it all,"" said he.
    And then Coyote proceeded on his way, following along in the
traveled trail. Then he saw how two old women at yonder divide
were hitting the ground several times with their canes. Thus they
were saying, ""Over there let Coyote die with his crying,"" said the
two old women. Now Coyote watched them from his hiding place
as they were doing thus; he was very angry as he saw them. "" I
shall cause you two to die,"" said Coyote. And then Coyote started
off in another direction away from the trail; when far away, he came
back to it far in front of the two old women.
    Coyote acted as though looking for tracks. ""Oh!"" said the two
old women, ""you are acting like Coyote,"" said they. "" O h ! "" said
Coyote, "" w h a t is it that this means?"" said he. Thereupon the two
old women said, ""This means that they have just killed Coyote's older
brother; but him, Coyote, they have left at that same place yonder.""
And then Coyote said, "" Ha, I would have killed him. What did you
two let Coyote go for?"" said Coyote. And then Coyote said, ""Over
there I have left my children, and now I am about to return,"" said he.
   And then Coyote started for home and hid from them at the divide.
And then the two old women again did as they had done, and Coyote
killed them. All of their bones he shook out; deinde Canis suum pen-
em gummis infixit per cutem unius feminae, whereupon she appeared
just as before. And then into one woman Coyote went himself.
Both of them went along on the traveled trail and arrived at the
camp. ""Oh! it looks like Coyote with our mother's skin put on
himself,"" (said the children of Rain). ""You are always teasing me,""
(said Coyote). And then the two old women arrived, and much they
ate.    "" O h ! it looks like Coyote with our mother's skin put on him-
self. See how fast they eat."" "" We are tired of what you keep saying
about us, calling us by that Coyote's name. Indeed we always act
in this way when we are journeying a long distance; when very
hungry, we are wont to eat quickly.""
   And then, when it was evening, the round dancing took place.

Those two old women were sitting nursing babies, and then all of
them they killed. Then, when it was early morning the two old
women went into the round dance. And then two very good runners
stood opposite them. Now those clothes of Wolf fell on them, the
two old women. Coyote jumped on to her two children 6 and said,
"" L e t my skin be on them!"" And then those two children got to have
on themselves t h a t same skin of the two old women. Thereupon
Coyote ran as hard as he could, very far on his way was he.
   And they said, "" T h a t is what I said, it is Coyote,"" said they, and
gave chase to him. Coyote started to give out; over a little mountain
ridge he ran close ahead of them. Then he was no longer visible
there; they hunted for him a t t h a t place, but did not find him. There-
upon one of them said, "" P e r h a p s it is this one,"" as he kicked some
old dog excrement. Coyote yelled out. Having jumped way off,
he ran as fast as he could, and they gave chase to him. I t happened
to Coyote as before. Over a little ridge he ran and barely escaped;
he turned into a gopher pile. I t happened to them as before. They
hunted for him there but could not find him, when one of them said,
"" Perhaps it is this one,"" and kicked the gopher pile. Again Coyote
jumped far off and again they gave chase to him.
   Again Coyote did as before. This time he turned into wind; and
then they hunted for him but could not find him. Then they said,
"" L e t us cause snow to fall,"" so then it snowed very much. And
then Coyote went into a little cave. Very much snow had fallen,
and Coyote went out to see how deep it was. After a while he was
unable to get out.       R a t was living therein. "" O h ! "" said Coyote,
"" my friend Rat, give me some of your tinder,"" 7 said he. "" All right,""
said R a t , and gave him some of his tinder. And then Coyote built
a fire, and, after he had done so, he began to imitate R a t ' s squeaking.
And then he killed R a t and ate him up.
   He went into a little shell and started to call his own wind. The
wind then arrived; in this direction it went, carrying him over the
snow. Yonder (his shell) stopped. He kept calling upon (his wind),
yet despite his words (his shell) did not move. And then Coyote
saw his own little cave, therein it was sitting. And then he came out
of it. Thereupon before daybreak he put his elder brother's body on
an ant-hill. And then he went back to his house.'
   "" W h a t does my elder brother mean,"" said he, ""when he says,
'Do not look at these things'?"" said Coyote. And then he looked
over all of (Wolf's) clothes, while engaged with them he untied (Wolf's)
                     X Southern Paiute and Ute

medicine. As soon as he had done so, it got to be very dark. "" O h ! ""
said Coyote, ""this is what he means when he says, ' D o not look at
them.' "" And then he heard (Wolf) howling there where he had put
him.     Coyote shouted when he heard it, ""Here I am,"" said he,
"" i n that same place, that little cave of mine."" Then Coyote shot,
he shot an arrow feathered with a crow's feathers. As soon as he had
done so, it got to be very dark. Now all the feathers gave out,
except that the flicker's feathers were left over. Then Coyote shot
the (arrow) up in the air. As soon as he had done so, it cleared up
and Coyote was glad.
   And then he went towards where he had put (Wolf). He came
there but, having done so, he did not find his elder brother's body
there. So then Coyote hunted for tracks but did not find them.
B u t after a while, continuing his search, he found them. Going in
yonder direction, Coyote tracked his elder brother; and then he found
a house. "" O h l "" said he, "" i t looks as though there are two. Look
at that!"" said he, as he looked around for tracks. And then it got
dark and they all went to sleep. Then, when it was early morning,
Coyote went to get wood. And all kinds of wood he asked, "" A r e
you one that pops always when you burn?"" said Coyote. "" N o , ""
said they, until only one was left. Coyote asked it, "" W h a t are you
accustomed to do?"" said Coyote. "" I am one that is accustomed
to pop when burning,"" said a dried-up fir.
   And then Coyote took along all that he could carry of it in his
arms. Then he built a fire of it, whereupon that popped. "" O n to
your blankets! Fire, my elder brother!"" said Coyote. Thereupon
his elder brother quickly doubled up his legs (that he had had stretched
out). (In this way) Coyote found the woman, his brother's wife.
"" T h a t is what I said,"" said Coyote.
   And then his elder brother said, "" G o ahead! Coyote, go hunting.""
"" All right,"" said Coyote. So then he went off in yonder direction, and
then he lay there in hiding. Soon after his brother went out hunting.
Thereupon Coyote broke his bow and started home toward the
house. And then he said, "" Has not my elder brother another bow?
M y bow broke,"" said Coyote. "" Your elder brother has not another
bow,"" said the woman. "" All right,"" said Coyote, and right there on
the ground he threw her down. Deinde cum ea copulavit. "" S t o p
doing thus to me!"" said the woman. "" N o , "" said Coyote. So then
that woman moved towards a quaking asp, and then she went into
it. Then Coyote was left fastened to the quaking asp.

elder brother, here am I fastened in the quaking asp,"" said he. Not
long after he spoke, Wolf got tired of it et tum penem Canis abscidit.
Deinde Canis dixit, "" m i frater, satis me habeam ita brevem penem
habere,"" inquit. And then Wolf told him to go and carry water in
a water-jar on his back. ""All right,"" said Coyote, and off in yonder
direction he went to carry water on his back. And then he turned
back and arrived at the house. And when he was about to take off
the water-jar (and put it on the ground), he could not take it off—
it was fastened to his back. "" L e t me, then, be wont always to do
in this manner merely, just carrying a water-jar always on my back,""
said Coyote.
   And then Wolf said, "" G o ahead! go and carry wood on your back.""
"" A l l right,"" said Coyote, and off yonder he went for wood to carry
on his back. And then he carried wood between (his back and)
water-jar. He arrived at the house; now that wood would not come
off his back. "" L e t me, then, have 'Wood-carrier' as name,"" said
Coyote. And then he set fire to it, and Coyote burned up together
with it.","[328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367]"

direction. Now then Wildcat was asleep in the daytime. The Wild-
cat looked very beautiful, and that one stood looking at him. "" What
shall I do to him?"" thought he. He pressed his face back with his
hands, he ripped his mouth wide open, and he did so likewise to his
eyes, he made his eyes look big. His hands he pressed back so as to
make them short, and his tail also he shortened by pressing back.
Everything that there was on him he shortened up by pressing back.
In that same place he was lying on the rock. When he had treated
him in that manner he went off. That Coyote went along in yonder
direction from there, and then he began to feel sleepy. Right there
in the daytime he fell asleep on the rock.
   And then the Wildcat awoke. "" W h a t is it that has happened to
me?"" thought he. He looked to where his tail was wont to be at
his side, but it was not there. And then he arose. When he had got
up, he felt all over his face with his hands. "" W h a t is it that has
happened to me?"" thought he. And then he looked at his shadow
and he appeared different. "" I n what direction did he go?"" thought
he. And then he tracked him along there. Now there Coyote was
lying and Wildcat found him. Wildcat stood near him, stood
thinking of what to do. He went up to him, stretched him out long,
and did so likewise to his tail, pulled it out. His mouth he ripped
open wide and his eyes he treated similarly, made them long and
narrow. His waist above the hips he also narrowed. He went away
when he had finished with him.
   Coyote was lying in that same place after he had gone away, and
then he woke up. "" What is it that has happened to me?"" thought he.
He kept looking at his nose, he also looked then at his tail. His
tail was long and he kept dragging his tail after him. And then he
went off to a creek and looked a t himself in the water. Sure enough
he was long-nosed. ""Yes, it is all right when I might want to be
drinking down in a rock hole. Everything is all right,"" thought he
then.","[518, 519]"
"                     § 30. Suffixes of verbal aspect.
   By ""aspect,"" a term borrowed from Slavic grammar, is here meant
the temporal range of the action, i. e. its definition with respect to
such concepts as momentaneousness, durativeness, inception, itera-
tion. These and like concepts have no primary connection with
the concept of relative time, which is the province of the temporal
suffixes (§ 32).

           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                       149   Among the ideas expressed by aspect suffixes, those of momen-
taneousness and durativeness are the most important. Every verb
has a durative and a momentaneous form, the former being generally
the primary form of the verb, the latter expressed by internal con-
sonant gemination, glottalization, reduplication, the suffixing of
certain elements, or a combination of these. The durative, as its
name implies, expresses continuous action, action conceived of as
lasting for an appreciable length of time (e. g. ΤΟ DRINK) ; the momen-
taneous conceives of the action as taking but a moment of time (e. g.
ΤΟ TAKE A DRINK) . Following are a few preliminary examples of the
distinction:

  The various methods of forming the momentaneous exemplified
above are to be considered as more or less equivalent. No simple
rules can be given for all cases. One simply has to learn, e. g., that
such a form as *yaya'quplya* is not in use, but that yaya'xAp'iya
must be employed.
  The aspects that may be recognized in Paiute are the durative,
the momentaneous, the inceptive, the iterative, the durative-iterative,
the resultative, the usitative, and the continuative. Moreover,
ideas that belong to the category of aspect are sometimes expressed
by means of compounded verb-stems or suffixes of motion (e. g. the
cessative by -maupa-, § 18, 2, a; the continuative or durative by
-qar'i- ΤΟ SIT, -q wa'ai- ΤΟ GO OFF, § 28, 2). A careful study of the
nuances of aspect formation can hardly be given here. We shall
simply list the various aspect suffixes with examples. For momentan-
eous (and inceptive) verbs formed by gemination or glottalization,
see § 53, 2; by reduplication, § 58, 5. For iteratives formed by re-
duplication, with or without accompanying gemination, glottalization,
or both, see § 58, 4.
  (1) -ya-g durative of active intransitive (mediopassive) verbs.

τ ο SHAKE and passive τ ο BE SHAKEN. Sometimes -ya- seems to be
used also with agentive active verbs. Examples of durative -ya- are:
riintci'yai  (it) shakes
piyo'xwai' (he) drags (it);     piyo'x Aqip'iya'aiywA      he came home
   dragging (it)
yiu'xwai'   moves around
yu'mu'x(w)Ap'iya'       (he) moved
qwimpu'xwai'      (it) wiggles
si'yu'xwai'   slides  T h e momentaneous correlate of -ya- is -qi- (see 3 below).
  T h e element -ya-g is very commonly employed in durative verbs
expressing a continuous sound of some sort, e. g.:
ampa'ya-       to talk
po 'yux Apiyain i there was a sound as of something going through
    (his) flesh (for -n ia- in these and other -ya- verbs, see § 19, 2, d).
fiijwa'vaya- to make a noise
ki 'yuxwa(i)yin i makes a noise like rattling coins
pa 'raxa(i)ym i (rain) patters
qu'pa'raxa-       to pop in burning
po 'n'noxwa{i)yin i sounds like drumming
no 'ruxwa{i)yin-C       sounds like a heavy object being dragged on a
    smooth level surface
                       •pi'T)kixa(i)ytn i sounds like dripping water
si·' yaxani'iylni      makes a rustling noise (for -n i'i-, see 12 below)  T h e momentaneous correlate of this -ya- also is -q i- (or -rjqi-).   (2) -γΐ-, (-ijqi-) durative-iterative, chiefly of active intransitive,
sometimes transitive, verbs. I t is often transitivized by means of
-yfi- (§ 29, 10). I t differs from -ya- in conceiving of the action as not
strictly continuous, but broken up into a rapid series. I t differs from
the normal iterative (expressed by reduplication) in t h a t the repeated
acts cohere into a single durative unit. Examples are:tarfwi'tciyc   keeps time by tapping with (his) foot
mavi'tSLji    claps hands
qinip uxwC ' (mouse) gnaws
ίΑ'ρϊ'η'αηα'χιηφί'    stamps (on the ground to make it smooth)

tAxqi'uyiyqi'qap    iya'    (they) chipped (it) into small pieces
ovwo'qway(c)i'        (it) bounces up and down (like a rubber ball)
tuvwa'yaitcai-     several pull out (intr.), emerge
 Sound-verbs indicating a continuous series of sounds of like nature
may also have the -yi- suffix, e. g.:
quypa'ra       x(t)ik  a- several pop (one after another)
w'ini'ruxwL-         to make a noise on the rasp
wa'a'uxwi           barks
w'a'tciyiijupiya'           (he) w h o o p e d   A few such verbs have -ΐ)φ- instead of -yi-, e. g.:
pu'qwi'airjqiyin-L             (he) pants
puy'wi'rjqii'           (mouse, rat) makes a peeping noise
ki{y)i'r}qiV            laughs
   (3) - q i - momentaneous, chiefly of active intransitive and medio-
passive verbs. Transitive forms in -q i-ηφ-.     Morphologically, -qi-
is the regular momentaneous correspondent of -yi-, formed from it by
gemination (§ 53, 2 b); it contrasts with both -ya- and -yi- forms.
Examples of its use are:
tA'pi'tcAqiTjqi'qwA          to crush it by stepping on (it)
mina'qi          (one thing) break(s) off
tarii'ntciqii]qip'iyai{y)aq     A (he) shook it by trampling once with (his)
    feet
mava't A'qirjqi to burst by means of the hand
lAxqi'lfIqwirjqip'iyaiAxqa      ' mI they hit it so as to have (it) go to pieces
iu'pa'q    ipiya       (one) pulled out (intrans.), emerged
to'pa'q i      (one object) come(s) loose
si'yu'q    wi     to slide, slip
   Midway between properly momentaneous forms in -qi- and
durative forms in -ya- or -yi- are certain verbs in -q i- with non-
momentaneous form of stem, i. e. with ungeminated consonant.
These may be termed durative-momentaneous. Examples of dura-
tive-momentaneous versus momentaneous forms are:
qovo'q-WL- to break (intr.): qo'po'q wi- to break instantaneously
paya'q (a)i- to tear slowly (but in one tear): pA'qa'q i- to tear

152                                 SAPIR  In such verbs -q-i- does not seem to alternate with -ya- and -yi-.
  Verbs indicating a momentaneous sound also have a -q-i- suffix, e. g.:
kiffca'q in i   (it) makes a sound as of when something is thrust
   through paper
sa'mu'qwiyini       makes a deep noise as when a stone is thrown into a
   well
qi 'k in-L (it) sounds like one tear of a rag
v'cu'q-WL whistles
   (4) -n a- durative transitive with singular object: -n'na- momen-
taneous transitive with singular object. See § 31, 2, b and c.   (5) -yu- n momentaneous. This is by far the most common mo-
mentaneous suffix. It follows most verb stems and is also employed
after many derivative and verbalizing suffixes. Examples are:
im- to drink                           ivi'yu to take a drink
maain-i- to touch (duratively)         maa'in-irju      to touch (for a
                                          moment)
qvni- to take (one object)             qwii'yu to pick up (one object)
maa-'vi'a- to be dressed               πιαα'νϊ'αηυ     to dress (intrans.)

pa(i)yi- to return                     pa(i)yi'yupiya""      returned (con-
                                          ceived as non-durative act)

                                          momentaneously, got near

ai-     to say                         a'ir/up'iya% spoke out   In particular cases -rju- n may take on an inceptive or cessative
significance, but its true force is never intrinsically inceptive or
cessative. Examples of these developments of the primary moment-
aneous idea are:
(a) toyoq-wi- to run                   toyo'qwnjui'   gets ready to run,
                                          starts to run

  These examples show that -i)u-n in the present (-yi-) may indicate a
momentaneous (or inceptive) activity that is just about to take
place (cf. the use of momentaneous forms in Russian to indicate the
future). The idea of imminent activity is still more explicitly
rendered by -quntsi-, compounded of -tju-n and diminutive -(ri)tsi-
(§ 35, 2). Thus, a form like trqa'quntsi- EAT-MOMENTANEOUS (IN-
CEPTIVE)-LITTLE,      TO B E   A LITTLE    OFF FROM BEGINNING TO         EAT,
easily comes to mean το BE ABOUT TO EAT. Examples of pre-inceptive
-r/untsi- are:qu'qwiyuntsilf oeni I am ready to shoot (for -ka- see § 32, 2)
ya'uqwirjunUik-A     (the sun) is about to set
A'pi'iTfunts komi I am about to fall asleep, I am sleepy  (6) -ij'wi- momentaneous (intransitive). This suffix, which may
be related to -yu-n, occurs only in two or three verbs, its durative
correlative being a rarely occurring -i- or, in one case, -q a-. These
verbs are:
         DURATIVE                                 MOMENTANEOUS
ttyai- to take place                      t'i'qaij'wi-
piyai-  to be left over                     piyay'wi-
cuwaqa-    to breathe                     cuwarfwi-      to take a long breath
    (7) -qu-, -ju-    momentaneous; inceptive. This element, like
-τμι-η, seems to be primarily momentaneous in significance and in a
number of verbs is used instead of -iju-"". Some verbs have both
-iju-"" and -q u- forms, generally with some idiomatic difference of
meaning. In many cases, moreover, -q u- is a properly inceptive
element, as in durative-inceptive -ya-q u-. What nuance of meaning
differentiates -q u- and -q u- is not clear. Presumably -q u- is more
definitely momentaneous in character (see § 53, 2, a, 3); as inceptive
it probably indicates a sharp moment of beginning.
   Examples of momentaneous -q u- are:
pA'qa-     to beat, kill                  pA'qa'qu-   to give a licking:
                                            pAxqa'yu-   to kill
wt'i-    to fall                          wV'i'q u- to drop down, fall out

                           TRANSLATION. 1 2   Way down to the west dwelt an old woman and her daughter.
 Now then that old woman said, ""Go ahead! go look for a person and
 then, having found him, let him come home with you."" And then
 that daughter of hers went off to seek in yonder direction; through
all the lands she sought, but she found no person. Only that Coyote
did she see. Then, when it commenced to be evening, she went off
home; she arrived at her mother's house. And then that mother of
hers asked her, ""Did you not see a person?"" "" I did not,"" said the
girl; ""only that Coyote did I see,"" said her daughter.     ""Go ahead
then! go after Coyote."" ""All right,"" said her daughter.
   And then she travelled yonder towards Coyote's house.         There
she arrived, in his, Coyote's, house. Thereupon she said to him, "" My
mother calls for you,"" said she. "" No,"" said Coyote, "" I shall not do
so,"" said he. ""You will take me to wife,"" said the girl.      "" I said
I shall not do so,"" said Coyote. And then Coyote said, "" Let me, then,
in urinam tuam immittere, 13 and then I shall go with you there to
your mother's house,"" said Coyote.
   ""Go ahead, then! first go and make a camp over there, and then
vulvam meam fodes."" 14 ""All right,"" said Coyote.           In yonder
direction he ran along, and then there he began to make a wickiup;
he finished making it.     And then he stood watching for her, and
saw her coming down. Then he tried lying down in the camp he

had made. Now that woman made Coyote sleep, and then that
Coyote slept. Then the woman came up to him. Apud Canis caput
urinam ea fecit, and left him sleeping at that same place. Having
got to be far away, she caused him to wake up. Then that Coyote
awoke. ""Oh!"" said he, ""where has she gone to? Surely she was
coming here."" Deinde urinam ejus conspexit; in it he did thus in
motion. 15
   And then, after he had done so, he pursued her and caught up
with her. Then he caught hold of her. And then, ""Feriam urinam
tuam,"" l e said Coyote. ""No,"" said the girl. "" Go and make a camp,""
said she to him; "" d o not sleep this time."" "" All right,"" said Coyote.
Yonder again he ran along, and then in that place he made a wickiup
again. Then it happened to him just as before, he went to sleep after
he had made the camp. That girl did to him just as before. Now by
acting (several times) in this same way she arrived at her mother's
house. Coyote arrived at the house right after her still.
   And then that old woman said, ""Coyote, go ahead! go off to hunt
in this direction."" ""All right,"" said Coyote, and off yonder Coyote
went to hunt; at that place Coyote killed a deer. He came back
home, and then the mother and daughter ate the meat. Deinde ilia
virgo ossa cervi sub se posuit et ilia vulva ejus ea moluit. And then
Coyote again went off to hunt. Very well he knew virginem vulvam
habere dentatam. Then a t that place he killed a mountain-sheep
buck and brought him on his back to the house. And then that girl
stuck the mountain-sheep's neck bone under herself. When she had
done so, illi dentes ejus vulvae relaxati omnes facti sunt. Then,
when it got to be night, he started to do so in motion. 17 "" I n this
way I always want to do, always doing so hurriedly,"" (said Coyote).
He ate well of her fat. 18 And then Coyote said, "" H o c 'vulva' ap-
pellabitur neque dentes habebit.""
   Then that old woman said, "" G o ahead! go and return to your
land. Take this sack along; do not untie it, even if sounds are heard
inside of it."" ""All right,"" said Coyote, and proceeded to return in
yonder direction. When at that place, he said, "" What did she mean
saying, 'Do not untie i t ' ? "" said Coyote. And then Coyote untied
the sack, and some distance from it consedit et defaecavit. "" O h ! ""
said Coyote. He came running towards the sack and quickly shut it.
In different directions trails arose, through which all kinds of persons
travelled in different directions. Of what was left over at the bottom
of t h e sack he made people. After he had done so, all around that
place, among houses scattered round about him, fires were burning.

"   The text material presented in this paper belongs to two rather
 distinct, though closely related, dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
 branch of Plateau Shoshonean. The bulk of the paper is devoted
 to mythological and other texts obtained in 1910 (February to May)
from Tony Tillohash, a young Kaibab Paiute from Kanab, in south-
western Utah; the balance, to mythological texts and one tale recorded
in English, secured in 1909 (August and September) from Charlie
Mack, a Uintah Ute from White Rocks, Utah.
   The Ute texts were obtained at White Rocks in the course of a
brief trip among the Utes of Uncompahgre and Uintah reserves.
A further series of thirty Ute tales was obtained in English by my
colleague, Dr. J. A. Mason; these were published under the title of
"" Myths of the Uintah Utes"" in The Journal of American Folk-Lore
for July-September, 1910 (pp. 299-363). I should not fail to add
that Dr. Mason also obtained a series of interesting pictographs in
the course of a reconnaissance of Nine Mile Canyon, some distance
south of Uintah Reservation. This material is still unpublished.
   More substantial for linguistics than the Ute work were the results
obtained from Tony, who was in 1910 just about to complete his
course at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Through the
kindness of Dr. G. B. Gordon, the director of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum, and of the superintendent of the Indian
School, arrangements were made to have Tony housed in Phila-
delphia and employed at the Museum, so that he might be ren-
dered available as a source of information for further Shoshonean
researches. Tony proved an excellent informant. Though young
and absent from his native home for about five years, he was of a
naturally conservative temperament and possessed of a remarkable
memory. Hence he was better informed on the subject of tribal
lore than could normally have been expected. His unfailing good
humor and patience also helped materially to lighten a task that
demanded unusual concentration. (Indeed, in all my linguistic
experience, I doubt if phonetic perception has ever been so severely
taxed as in recording Shoshonean dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
group.) Besides the Kaibab Paiute texts here presented, there were

300                                   SAPIR
secured from Tony supplementary material for the grammatical and
lexical study of his language; a series of over two hundred songs,
chiefly ceremonial, recorded in text and on the phonograph; and a
considerable body of ethnological information. The grammatical
data have been worked up into a sketch of the Paiute language,
which forms the first part of this volume. The lexical material fol-
lows in the third part. The songs and the ethnological data will
form the subjects of future papers. Tony, further, proved valuable
as a first-hand source for a seminar in American Indian linguistics
that I was then giving at the University of Pennsylvania. Last, but
not least, he was a delightful companion at all times and is remem-
bered with the friendliest feelings by all who came in contact with
him in Philadelphia.
   The linguistic relation of Southern Paiute (to be carefjlly dis-
tinguished from Northern Paiute or ""Paviotso"") to Uintah Ute is
close. Indeed, they are not so much closely related languages as
mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. This probably
applies to all the dialects of Ute-Chemehuevi, which may be defined
as a dialectically differentiated Shoshonean language stretching from
Uncompahgre Ute in central Colorado to Chemehuevi in southeastern
 California. The texts embodied in the present volume are therefore
illustrative of one of the most widespread languages of aboriginal
 America, though the specific dialects of the texts, Kaibab Paiute and
Uintah Ute, cover only restricted territories in southwestern Utah
and northwestern Arizona and in northeastern Utah respectively.
No attempt has been made to normalize the texts, which are given
here precisely as heard. The phonetic system used is that described
 in the report of the Phonetic Committee of the American Anthro-
pological Association ; l the symbols are defined in the key prefixed to
 the texts. Those wishing to make an analytical study of the language
 are referred to the Paiute grammar which precedes; the necessary
 lexical assistance is given by the Paiute dictionary which follows.
    In their mythological affiliations the tales recorded here evidently
 correspond closely to the Ute, Shoshone, and Comanche tales already
 published by Kroeber, Mason, Lowie, and St. Clair. References to
 parallel tales have been confined to Plateau Shoshonean. Further
 parallels from other Plateau tribes, from Plains tribes to the east,
 and from California and Washington-Oregon tribes to the west are  1

given in the papers mentioned. On the whole, the relation of Southern
Paiute mythology to that of the Northern Shoshone is very close,
perhaps even closer than might have been expected.
   In conclusion, I should like to express my indebtedness to the
late Dr. Gordon's kind help which was given me throughout the
prosecution of my Shoshonean studies.

       α like u of English but.
      ä as in English hat.
      4 as in French patte; midway between a and ä. A nuance of
            of a that is characteristic of Ute.
      e close as in French ete. Occurs only rarely, as nuance of i
            or of a-ä-ε.
      ε open as in English met.
      i close as in French fini.
       ! open as in English it.
      ο close as in au of French chapeau.
      ο open as in German voll, but less clearly rounded,
      ω approximately like aw of English law, but more nearly
            approaching a.
      u open as in English pull, sporadically close as in English
            rule; always close when long (u ).
      u· long and open as in English poor, but without r-glide.
      I high-back-unrounded-narrow (Sweet's terminology); may be
            produced by completely unrounding close u, without
           modifying tongue position of u. On first acquaintance
           this vowel impresses one as a "" m u d d i e d "" nuance of ü,
           but its formation is quite unlike that of French or Ger-
           man ü. Its semivocalic form is γ (see below), to which
           it is related as u to w or i to v. ϊ, ii, and i are modified
            forms of ϊ.
      t high (or high to mid)-back-unrounded-wide; related to ϊ
           approximately as t to i or ε to e. I t is apt to sound like
           a "" m u d d i e d "" ö or a dull a.
      ü not a true ü as in French or German, but duller in timbre.
           Probably high-niixed-rounded-wide; apt to sound like a
           rapid diphthongal i u .
      i high-mixed-rounded-wide; approximately like i of English
           (American) first, but without r-quality.
      ö as in German schön or Götz (i. e. close or open in quality).
           Rare in Paiute, but very common in Ute, where it corres-
           ponds to Paiute o.

  •   and other superior vowels:
          weakly articulated, but not completely unvoiced, vowels.
          They are frequently glides, sometimes they are reduced
          from fully articulated vowels. After their own vowel,
          generally long, e. g. a "", they denote'' pseudo-diphthongal""
          rearticulation. Before and after glottal stops (') they
          are murmured in Paiute, after glottal stops they are
          whispered in Ute.
  A and other small-cap vowels:
          completely unvoiced vowels, pronounced with full
          breath. They may be defined as voiceless breath
          modified by various vocalic timbres.
  q and other vowels with subscript hook:
          nasalized vowels; nasalization is either weakening of η
          (see below) or secondary, due to presence of preceding or
          following nasal consonant. \y, nasalized w, occurs
          sporadically in Ute as development of i}.
        1
  i,        weakly articulated, but not completely unvoiced, nasal-
          ized vowels.
  k and other vowels with superscript ' :
          glottalized vowels, i. e. vowels interrupted by a series of
          weak glottal stops. This type of articulation is some-
          times referred to as "" glottal r . "" w, glottalized w, occurs
          sporadically as development of u'. ä is secondarily
          developed from a' or 'a; similarly for other vowels.
  TJ, '{ unvoiced forms of >4, j; may be defined as voiceless
          nasalized breath with u and ϊ timbre respectively. This
          type of articulation is rare.
Diphthongs.
  ai, äi, äi, εϊ, oi, oi, ui pronounced as diphthongal combinations
         of a, ä, ä, s, ο, ο, and u respectively with following i.
         These diphthongs are either inorganic, i arising as glide
         before following y, or organic, in which case the first
         vowel is sometimes heard doubled, e. g. aai, ooi. In
         certain cases the two vowels are pronounced with a drag,
         indicated as a.i; in others, the i is rather faint, indicated
         as a'.
  a'l diphthongal combination of a and ϊ.
  au diphthongal combination of a and u (cf. ou of English
         gout), aau, a.u, and a u are also found.

"  ( 2 ) U S E OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.
  (a) In perhaps the majority of cases the substantive verb follows
and is phonetically disconnected from its predicate noun or subject;
an adverb, however, may precede and the predicate noun follow the
verb. In these cases the final vowel of the word preceding the
substantive verb is elided. Examples are:
cina'rjwav aru""a coyote it-is
''itc aro""ami' qa'tcu quna""ap-A this (inan.) be-usitative not fire-
    negative, this (that we have been burning) is not fire

   (b) A second method of employing substantive verbs is to attach
them to the preceding predicate noun or subject (noun or independent
pronoun), a glottal stop separating the a- or u- of the substantive
verb from the preceding final vowel, which is preserved; e. g. iici'
'aru'a- this (inan.) i s beside ''itc aru'a-. Perhaps such forms as iter'
'am'a- may be considered as verbs with incorporated nominal (or
pronominal) subject (§ 18, 2, f, t); e. g. Hci""aru'a~, cinaywavi'urywaro'a-.
Forms of this type are obligatory for independent pronouns of the
first and second persons. Examples are:

na'a'ints tsi' aru'"" little-girl it-is (absolute: na'a'intsits )

   (c) The idea of B E I N G OF, B E L O N G I N G TO is normally expressed, as
illustrated above in several examples, by preceding the substantive
verb with an objective form of genitive significance, e. g.:
ni'niaru' aro' aro""anA me-interrogative is being, is it being of me?
   is it my property?
n\'ni \waru"""" me he-is, he is mine
imi' 'uraru"" (aru""anA) thee it-is (being), it is yours
  By a curious idiom, however, the logical owner is sometimes put
in the subjective, the thing owned in the objective, as though the
substantive verb were to be translated directly as ΤΟ OWN, e. g.:
itci'an aro""ai' this (inan.)-obj.-I be- present, this is mine, I own this

There are commonly used constructions in Paiute that are analogous
to such English locutions as IT IS I WHO — with predicate pronoun,
except that there is no substantive verb expressed, the IT doing
service for it. The pronominal form for IT employed in Paiute is
the inanimate visible enclitic, -aq a-. I t is regularly preceded, it
would seem, by enclitic -a-, - a- (§ 19, 3, a). There is always a

252                                   SAPIRstrong emphasis on the independent pronoun to which the -aqa- is
attached. Examples are:

imi'ni(y)a q· ucu       thou-like-it, maybe it is you (-niaq- probably <

"   Negative forms are generally preceded by the negative adverb
qatcv-, less often qa. The latter, though closely attached to the
following word, is not a prefix, as shown by the unaffected phonetic
treatment of the negatived word, e. g.:
   rii' qa q ari'ywa'"" I not stay-negative, I was absent
   mam u'c v qa yura'<t>Axqaq'wai't iini they are unconquerable
   qatcu- is evidently compounded of qa and an element -tcu- which clear-
ly goes back to spirantized -tu- (cf. usitative participle -vatä- < -va-t'i-,
§ 25, 6, c; and postpositions in -pa-tc . . .- < -pa-t . . . - , § 50, 4, 37);
this is proven by comparative evidence, cf. Mono gadu, garu NOT.
The noun, independent pronoun, or verb that is negatived is provided
with a negative suffix or negative modification of a verbalizing suffix.
All such negative elements contain a glottal stop. Somewhat
infrequently, negative forms are found unpreceded by a negative
adverb.",[270]

         M a n y Southern Pauite m y t h s are characterized by the use of ""song
recitatives,"" t h a t is, set melodies to the tune of which the characters of t h e
myth recite their speeches. Not all myths, however, have such recitatives.
Thus, the story of "" C o y o t e and Porcupine"" (pp. 456-462) was explicitly stated
by Tony to be told without recitatives. This m a y be suggestive of borrowing
from the Utes, with whom this story is a favorite and who, so far as known,
use no song recitatives in their m y t h s ; the mention of buffalo in the m y t h
would also indicate t h a t it is of eastern provenience. Stories possessing song
recitatives may be presumed to be of a western provenience. See Sapir,
op. cit., pp. 471-472.
    Only two m y t h s were recorded with the appropriate recitatives: "" G r a y
Hawk and Toad g a m b l e "" (pp. 414-426) and "" T h e Badger People wage War
against Wolf and Coyote"" (pp. 432-444). T h e five types of recitative belonging
to these m y t h s have been given above. A supplementary set of six recitative
t y p e , is appended here with references to t h e m y t h s t h a t they belong to.
T h e speeches are given in the recorded m y t h s in the form of prose.

  I t should be noted t h a t the Paiute term translated "" C o y o t e "" in this and the
 following myths, cina'ywatt>i, is not the ordinary word for coyote, b u t is a

lies in the fact t h a t the mourning songs of today are classified into four animal

       This refers to the berry bush, which they had used as a landmark to
locate the cache of dried meat. Now that it was stripped of berries, they were
unable to recognize it.
   33
       The old woman and her great-grandson had escaped from the village
Iron-Clothes had destroyed. Had he thought the child was a boy, he would
have slain him, to prevent the possibility of his growing up and avenging
his kinsmen.

paring food for the rescuing party.
   39
      She had received a jack-rabbit from her sons, but claims to have caught
him herself by killing him with her seed-beater. Iron-Clothes doubts this,
as it looks to him as if the jack-rabbit had been hit in the eye with an arrow.
   40
      1, e., on former occasions the antelope had always warned of the approach
of danger by making the peculiar noise and immediately galloping off home.
His failure to appear this time arouses Iron-Clothes' suspicion.
   41
       He stretched himself because he had just gotten up and was still sleepy.

       This tale of Chipmunk and the Giant seems to correspond to the Sho-

of Chipmunk is generally taken by Weasel or Mosquito. See Lowie, The

quantities near St. George, Nev., and used as food by the Indians.
   "" Rat had butchered the deer on leaves and branches in order to prevent
traces of the meat from showing on the earth. By burning the leaves and
branches he destroyed all traces of the butchering.
   *4 This incident argues a knowledge on the part of the Paiute Indians of
the custom of burning the dead. The custom, however, was not practiced
by the Paiutes themselves. This point may eventually help to determine
from what tribe or area the widespread story of the ""hoodwinked dancers""
came to the Paiute.

              When held down by the woman, Gray Hawk made a noise, thus leading
      Coyote to infer that something was wrong. He thought that Hawk was

        Mamputs, chief of the Cedar City Paiutes, is supposed to have been
 traveling about and to have returned from the country of the Southern Utes.
 He had a mannerism of addressing everyone by a term of relationship, by
 way of being friendly. An older man he addressed as "" f a t h e r , "" an older
 woman as ""mother,"" a very old man or woman as "" g r a n d f a t h e r "" or ""grand-

"                            § 53. Internal stem changes.
  Verbal stem changes in Paiute that are of morphological signifi-
cance may be classified under the heads of reduplication (see § 58,3-6),
vocalic modification, and consonantal affection. Only the two latter
are discussed at this point.
   (1) VOCALIC ALTERNATIONS. Vocalic alternations are either quanti-
tative or qualitative, the former, insofar as they are of morphological

significance, being relatively infrequent. In all, six types of vocalic
alternation may be recognized.
   (a) Vocalic lengthening. A short vowel may be lengthened, a long
one over-lengthened (e. g. a· to a-a), to indicate the idea of I N V A I N ,
TO NO EFFECT, e .    g.:qa'aplya'    sang to no effect ( < qa - to sing)
'a'aip'iya'   said without effect ( < ai- to say)
α'τηραχαΐ     talks to no purpose ( < ατηρα'χαϊ talks)
'o 'n'niy'uq WA did it (inv.) in vain ( < un Crfitq-WA did it)
These examples indicate that it is regularly the first vowel of the
word which is lengthened.
  Another group of cases of vocalic lengthening seems to be associated
with the idea of continuation. Examples are not very numerous:
pini rjw'in-q n uq WLXw'aim'arjWA look-stand about (-yw'ino- < -Tjwln-'L-
   to stand, assimilated by following -n vq tt>t-)-run-go-future-him

  entered, barely escaped by going over it
  (b) Vocalic alternation to indicate number (and voice). In certain
verbs, the final vowel is a, a·, o, or u in the intransitive singular, i in
the intransitive plural and in the transitive. Examples are:
topa-qi-   (tree, feather, tooth)          iivi-trai-several come loose; -top i-

   ized bv -ijqi-, § 29, 10)   (c) Vocalic alternation to indicate aspect. In a few cases a final
-a- vowel of the stem when used iteratively (or continuatively) con-
trasts with an -i- of the stem when used semelfactively, e. g.:
up-vq-(w)i-      to bounce (once)              ovwoq(w)a-y(s)i-  to bounce up

   30,3)                                         30,1)   (d) Vocalic alternation to indicate active {-a·-) and mcdio-passive or
static (-<-). A very considerable number of verb stems alternate in
their final vowel between α• and i, a smaller number between ya-
and i. The former form of the stem is used for the active intransitive
(or transitional) voice, the latter for the medio-passive, static, or
resultative voice. The i- forms seem to be durative, the a - forms
tend to be momentaneous. Examples are:

iyon a- to carry in one's arms               iyan'na- to carry several times
ya-vayai-   to fear                          yi'i-p-aq ai- to be afraid several
                                                times (note irregular change of
                                                -a - to -Ϊ -)     3. To indicate momentaneous activity, e. g. -n'na- momentaneous
transitive with singular object: -n a- durative transitive with singular
object (§ 30, 4).
   Glottalization alone as a grammatical process is relatively rare.
Generally it accompanies distributive or iterative reduplication (see
§ 58, 3 and 4), less often gemination alone (see b).
   (b) Gemination in verb stems. Gemination primarily denotes
momentaneous activity; the contrast between momentaneous and
durative, as might be expected, tends to become one of singularity
and plurality. Gemination is very commonly employed with the
momentaneous suffixes -q i- (§ 30, 3) and -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c). Other
examples of momentaneous gemination are:

-ya- durative suffix (§ 30, 1)           -qi- momentaneous suffix (§ 30,3)
   Far less frequently gemination indicates iterative activity, e. g.:
qaqafi-     to run away                  qaqat'i-    to run away several
                                           times
ya-vayai-     to fear                    yV'i-paqai-   to be afraid several
                                           times
   Even these examples are really but special forms of gemmation
accompanying reduplication. Combined gemination and reduplica-
tion, to indicate distribution or iteration, is common (see § 58, 3, h;
§ 58, 4, a, d, f).
                        § 54. Singular and. plural stems.
   All verbs are determined as regards singularity or plurality of the
subject, less often of the object also; the singular form includes
reference to the dual. The most common method of indicating
plurality of the subject is by the use of the suffix -q a- (§ 31, 1, c); for
other suffixes indicating or implying plurality of subject or object, see
§ 31, 1, a and b; § 3 1 , 2 , a-d. Vocalic alternation of the final vowel of
the stem is also sometimes associated with change of number (see § 53,
1, b). The idea of distribution expressed by reduplication often passes
over into that of plurality of the subject or object (see § 58, 3).
   Besides these formal methods of expressing number, there are
certain verb stems that are inherently limited in their reference to
number, the singular-dual of the intransitive subject or transitive
object being expressed by a stem which is etymologically distinct

from that for the plural of the intransitive subject or transitive object.
Certain of these stem contrasts are:

                                                   kill several
win-ai- to throw down one                       nu'a- to throw down several

                                                   (cf. wayi- above)
mi'na-(q i-)      one (object) breaks           mimio'i-     (reduplicated) several
  off                                              break off (irregularly related
                                                   to singular form)
    Several of these verb stems are also used as the second element
in compound verbs. T h e whole verb may be characterized as singular
or plural in this w a y ; a pluralizing -q a- may thus become unnecessary,
e. g. ivi- O N E D R I N K S : im-k a- S E V E R A L D R I N K , but ivi-ywin-'i- O N E
DRINKS S T A N D I N G : iviywaywi- S E V E R A L DRINK S T A N D I N G .     Singularity
or plurality of the object is not disturbed by composition, e. g.
paq a-rjw'in 'i- O N E STANDS AND K I L L S O N E ; paq a-rjwaywi- S E V E R A L
S T A N D A N D K I L L O N E ; qj'i-ijwin 'i- O N E S T A N D S AND K I L L S S E V E R A L ;
qo'i-ijwaijwi- S E V E R A L S T A N D AND K I L L S E V E R A L . Similarly, note

  A small number of singular and plural verb stems are used only
as second elements in verb compounds, e. g.:
-kwa'{a)i-    one goes (see § 28, 1;    -m ia- several go (less frequently
   practically suffix)                     used as independent stem)
-ya'(a)i-    to die (independent        -tupi-, -tupa-      (only in com-
  stem), e. g. tiyii-ya'ai- to die of      pounds; perhaps identical with
  hunger, to be hungry                     tup i- to be used up), e. g.
                                           fiyvi-tcupi- several are hungry,
                                           naya-ntupa- several get angry
uxqu'mpu-tcaq ai-      one (thing)      uTqu' mpu-tcdcai-xw' ai-     several
  goes off in dust                         (things) go up in dust
  The plural -namtci- το BECOME (perhaps reciprocal no-® +             pitci-
TO ARRIVE: TO ARRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER, TO GET TO BE AMONG
THEMSELVES) either corresponds to singular -tiqay'wi- (also used
independently) το BECOME or is used as a verbal quasi-suffix of
plurality, e. g.:
qatcutiqarj'wi-    to not-become,       qatcvn avitci- several get tired out
   one gets tired out
pat.caqwi- one is (or gets) wet         patcaq winavitci- several get wet
tuywi- fire goes out                    tuywinavitci- fires go out                            § 55. Verb syntax.
 Under this head may be conveniently grouped a number of pheno-
mena that affect the verb in relation to other words in the sentence.
   ( 1 ) SUBORDINATING ELEMENTS.      Subordinate clauses, denoting
cause, time, condition, concession, or attendant circumstance, are
extremely frequent in Paiute. Those of these clauses that are used
with logical subjects put them in the objective form. Thus, a
sentence like WHEN I CAME, YOU WERE AWAY is rendered WHEN ME
CAME, YOU WERE AWAY.       In all probability the objective is in these
cases to be interpreted genitivelv, the subordinating element as a
specialized postposition; e. g. AT MY COMING, YOU WERE AWAY.
This receives some support from the fact that a few of the ordinary
postpositions may be suffixed to verb forms (see 2 below). However,
of the verb-subordinating elements only -yu- (see c below), possibly
also -qu- (see e), is employed also with nouns (see § 50, 4, 49). The

      244                                      SAPIR
      tense elements -pa·- (§ 32, 4) and -q-ai- (§ 32, 3) may precede the
      subordinating suffix, but not the other tense elements. Five sub-
      ordinating suffixes are found, the first three of which introduce
      clauses referring to the subject of the main clause, the other two
      clauses with a different subject.
         (a) -tsi- gerund. Subordinates in -tsi- are here termed gerunds
      because they have no expressed subject, though they may have an
      object. Their logical subject is always the same as that of the main
      clause. They indicate antecedent circumstance or activity and
      are most appropriately translated in English by participial phrases:
      HAVING — E D .   I t is at least possible that the gerund -i st.- is etymologi-
      cally related to the animate noun suffix -tsi- (§ 24, 1, f); such a sentence
      as HAVING so DONE, H E RETURNED would then originally have meant
      THE ONE WHO DID so RETURNED.             Examples are:      maa'iisiyw imi'ywa'aiijiVA pa(i)yi'kiva'   find-gerund-him   (inv.) thou-
          with-him (inv.) return-hither-will; having found him with you, (he)
          will come home
      %nik mjum'its· min i's-'its mjwa'i-uikaijupiya'     after having so done
          (plur.), having returned, (they) caused (it) to rain
      iini'ts·, %ni'Tjuts• having so done, then (frequently used as sentence
          connector); uniyutsiyiVA    then he (inv.)
      rii' non-o'cC qwiya'tcitciqarfwds-       I dream-present bear-become-
          gerund, I dream that I turned into a bear
        Future gerunds in -va t-si-, -vipatsi- BEING ABOUT TO—are also
      very common and frequently found in idiomatic turns. Examples
      are:
      axa'ny-kava     (sL7jwar)w a'l-kaV    h o w - d o - p l u r a l - f u t u r e - g e r u n d - h i m (inv.)-

         (b) -kai- W H E N , WHILE, AS; appears as spirantized -yai- or nasalized
      -Tjqai-. This is a true subordinating suffix, attached to verb forms
      whose subject is the same as that of the main verb. While -t si-

forms denote antecedent activity, -kai- forms denote contemporaneity
of action. Examples are:sv'vw'ar)WA qari'm'miuxa' t'(ψνϊ'ιυα if (§ 60, 2, d)-he (inv.) sit-move-as

   -kai-c-u- (with enclitic -cu-; see § 19, 2, k) often implies immediate
sequence: AS SOON AS, e. g.:
a'iiaic-u άηα'ψΰαφι quna'manti wTqa'm'Mi'kaipiya'               say-as-just
   coyote fire-at-being (obj.) covered; as soon as Coyote said so, (he)
   covered some of (the) fire  Concessive clauses of the same subject as the main clause are
formed by appending -c-ampa- (§ 19, 2, j) to -kai-, e. g.:iya'xaxayqaic ampa yA though fearing him (vis.), (he went to meet
   him)
   (c) -yu- WHEN, WHILE, AS. This subordinating suffix seems to
be identical in meaning with -kai- (see b above). I t is suffixed only
to stems or verb suffixes ending in -ai-. I t always replaces -kai- after
verb suffixes ending in -ai- (e. g. resultative subordinate -q-ai-yu-
WHEN SAYING, not *-q-ai-yai-).       After verb stems in -ai, -kai- is
used (e. g. ai-yai- WHILE SAYING), unless followed by enclitic -c-ampa-,
but not, e. g., -cu- (hence ai-yai-c u-, but ai-yu-c ampa-).   Examples
of -yu- clauses are:niijwl'xaiyu' n'ni person-be-as-thou do! act like a person!
naijqa'q ai'yvq IVA when (he) heard it (inv.)   Clauses in -yu-cu-, analogous to those in -kai-c-u- and -ku-c-u-,
are found after verbal suffixes in -ai-, e. g.:•Uni'k-aiyvc u un""i'k-upiya do-resultative-as-just fall-momentaneous-
  past; while so doing, (he) fell down   Concessive clauses in -yu-c ampa- replace forms in -kai-c ampa-
after all verbs in -ai-, e. g.:

"                           § 24.   Noun suffixes.
  (1)   A B S O L U T I V E OR CLASSIFYING ELEMENTS. Many nouns end in
a suffix that either suggests classification of the noun under a general
category or that has little assignable significance except to render the
noun absolute. Some of these elements disappear in composition
or when the noun is used with a possessive pronominal enclitic, others
may or may not. Some nouns appear with or without an absolutive
suffix, e. g. rii'yw'L and riiywints· PERSON.
   (a) -vi-n, -p i-"", -mpi-n absolutive suffix implying indefiniteness
or non-specification of possessor. These elements, which immediately
follow the stem, are used with nouns expressing objects, persons, or
relations that can hardly be thought of except in connection with
other objects or persons, e. g. terms of relationship, body-part nouns,
and substantivized local concepts (e. g. BOTTOM, SURFACE). They
may be rendered by SOMEBODY'S, OF SOMETHING or, preferably, left
untranslated. They always disappear with pronominal enclitics and
in composition.

114                                  SAPIR   A few personal nouns are derived by combining (-1n-n,)-p-i-""
(,-mpi-n) with -tsc- (see below), e. g.:
'iija""piU· baby: ϊηα·""αηι my baby
mi'pits·      evil spirit, ghost, irii'pintupi   ghost-making-game (for
    final -p i, see § 25, 5, a)
   Less frequently this suffix is also combined with -mp'C- (see e below),
e. g.:
cvi'vwimpi squaw-bush, ordinarily σίί'φϊ (stem cvi-"", e. g. ciiru- to
   make a basket out of squaw-bush twigs)
   (c) -mpi-3 BERBY. This classificatory suffix can hardly be identified
with -mpi- of (a) or (b) above, as it occurs in consistently nasalized
form after all stems (e. g. wa'a'mpi CEDAR-BERRY < wa'a-0 CEDAR)
and has spirantizing, not nasalizing, power. Examples are:
tiywa'mpi     service-berry, ίίψΰατηριφϊ    service-berry bush (for -vt-
   see e below)
wa'a'mpi cedar-berry (cf. wa'a'p-ϊ cedar tree)

   (d) -vi-*, -p 'i-*, -mp'C-* absolutive suffix, very similar, as regards
range of usage, to -vi-n, -p i-"", -mpi-"" (b above). I t is used in certain
body-part nouns, in nouns denoting movable objects, objects in mass
(e. g. SAND, MUD), and topographical features, and in nouns denoting
HIDE, BLANKET.       I t is partly movable, partly fixed. When appropri-
ate, this suffix may be followed, though infrequently, by           (see a
above).
   Examples of -vi-* are:

whose second element, -ρϊ-', is shortened (see § 11) from pTi-',
ρϊ-' HIDE (see above; -vi-' of ρΰ'φϊ HIDE itself, however, is clearly
absolutive).
    Apparently distinct from absolutive -vi-', though not easy to keep
apart from it, is -νϊ- (-ρ ϊ- and -mp'i- are not found alternating with it)
suffixed to nouns used in some specialized or metaphorical sense.
These nouns are generally compounds. When possessive enclitics
are added, possessive -a- (see 2, a below) is generally suffixed to
-vi-. Examples are:

   (2) E L E M E N T S DEFINING POSSESSION. Here are grouped a number
of suffixes that appear chiefly with possessive pronominal enclitics and
which, on the whole, define the nature of the possessive relation.
It is not always easy, as a matter of fact, to see exactly what increment
of significance they bring.
   (a) -a- seems to be used to indicate possession that is alienable,
particularly, it would seem, of such objects as are not normally
thought of as being possessed. It is generally preceded by -ρϊ-*
(see 1, d and e). Examples are:
fivwi'piariimi     our (excl.) country {-riimi our); RVwL ρ 'Laiariimi our
   country (obj.) (-ία- objective, § 49, 1).
ρα·'""νϊαηι spring that I own
a'oTjqovianl my dried-up woods
üyqa'nivia(i)ya'i)WA his cave (obj.) owned as house (-ya- objective);
   fiijqa'nLviatsia^i  his own little cave (obj.) (-tsi- diminutive; -a-
   objective; -φϊ, § 40, 4)
  Possessive -a- may also be used with causative -tui- (§ 29, 12)
to form verbs indicating ΤΟ CAUSE TO HAVE SO AND SO, e. g.:
tumpwi' Apiiplya' caused (it) to have stones
qan-L Atuip lya   caused (it) to have houses
nayqa'Atuip 'iya caused (it) to have branches
   For possessive -a- combining with verbalizing -kai- το HAVE into
-ayai- (participle -ayaiifi-), see § 26, 1, b; for possessive -a- after
past passive participial -ρ ϊ-, see 3, b below.
   (b) -rjwa-, -t)'wa-. These elements are used very much like -α-,
occurring both before possessive pronominal enclitics and verbalizing
-kai- το HAVE, not, however, before causative -tui-.    They do not
seem to be used after elassificatory -pi- (1, d and e), but may be
directly appended to noun stems. Examples of -ψνα- are:
pai'ywani  my blood (absolute pai'p r, in possessive forms of this
  noun -ywa- is always used)

   (§ 25, 6, a)-possessive-my, snow belonging to me (snow-raining =
   snow)   Examples of -rfwa- (it is not clear how, if a t all, it differs in usage
from -rjwa-) are:tümp'°i'y'wa i)A his rock
ma'xarir'iijwa(i)yayA    his clump of trees (obj.)
qa-'n(uinüTj'wa yA sing-become (§ 26, 1, g)-present ptc. (§ 25, 6, a)-
  possessive-his, song belonging to him   Both -ywa- and -rfwa- are used particularly to indicate possession
of one of a group by the group (e. g. OUR LEADER = THAT ONE OF US
WHO is LEADER). This includes adjectival participles indicating
selection (e. g. THE GOOD ONE of several). Examples are:nia 'vuj'waraywA our chief; qani'ayanfiA nia 'viij'wA house-possessive-
   having-obj. chief-possessive, village's chief
ampa'xarirj'wa m i talker- possessive-their, their talker; qan i ayanti
   ampa'xariy'wA village's main speaker
ava'Ciijw'aijw'uywA     big-present ptc. (§ 25, 6, a)-possessive-animate

   their, the good ones (anim. obj.)
fWi'tc at vr)wa{i)'yaq wA very good-present ptc.-obj.-their (inan.),
   a very good one of them (inan.)   (c) - a- is used to indicate possession, chiefly of body-parts, t h a t
is inherent without being strictly inalienable. In other words, it
is suffixed to nouns indicating objects (or persons) t h a t do often
occur disconnected in experience (e. g. SALIVA, BONE, SKIN) but are
thought of as indissolubly connected. Examples are:

    (obj.)  (d) -in'{n)i-' (-'in i-') OWNED. This element is always employed
with alienable nouns and has a specific reference to actual ownership
as contrasted with mere possession in the grammatical sense. Ex-
amples are:

•poo'in'ninl my owned trail (not merely: trail t h a t I use)

they are first verbalized. This is generally done by suffixing -Icai- ΤΟ BE
(§ 26, 1, a) and then turning the denominative verb into a participle.
Thus, the future form of qava-' HORSE is qava 'xaiva nti HORSE-BE-
FUTURE-PARTICIPLE, A HORSE ΤΟ BE; similarly, qam 'i'xawätci JACK-
RABBIT-BE-USITATIVE-PARTICIPLE, ALWAYS A JACKRABBIT.             Here we
shall specifically list only two compound suffixes relating to past
time, because of their rather characteristic usage.   (a) -yaip'i-,      -qaip-ϊ-,        -ijqaip· Ϊ-   HAVING     BEEN,   PAST,   FORMER;
compounded of -Icai- ΤΟ BE and past participial -pi-                    (see § 25, 5, a).
Examples are:
ini'ayaipini      my dead relation < ini'a ni my relative
muru""ιχαίρ i cast-away blanket
o'tca'(vi)yaip ϊ formerly used water-jar (o't-CA)
qa'yaaitlaxaipia'aywA      rat-hunt-place-be-past partic.-obj.-his, place
   (obj.) where he used to h u n t rats
tma'uykaipi      punch-er-be-past partic., one who used to be a puncher
   (b) -p i- PAST, FORMER. This is the past participial -p i- (see § 25,
5, a), only rarely used with noun stems, e. g.:
qanip'i     abandoned house, village site, old camping place
  I t is sometimes found combined with possessive -a- (2, a) as                    -ρϊα-,
e. g.:
a'i<t>Api(y)anyivw'ini            youth-past-possessive- friend-my, my former
   youthful friend
  This -ρ ϊα- occurs also combined with other elements in verbal
forms (see -p'ia-yai-tua-, § 32, 8; -p 'ia-yi-, § 32, 7)                              § 25. Nominalizing          suffixes.
   These are formed chiefly from verb and adjective-verb stems. The
verbal noun in -n a- and the various participles are in very frequent,
in part idiomatic, use.
  ( 1 ) AGENTIVE -vi-"",           -mpi-n.    Examples of agentive-Π'-"" are:

were assembled together. There they had a council. T h a t Coyote
said, "" F o r what reason is it that our people are all dying off?"" said
he. "" Let us, every one of us, assemble together, and then let us cry
for those who are dying off."" There indeed were assembled together
every kind of animal that was to be.10 After they had assembled
together, they commenced singing songs.
   Thereupon that Coyote said, "" L e t me begin the singing."" "" A l l
right,"" said they. So Coyote began the singing of one of his songs.
"" E n o u g h for y o u ! "" they said to him. "" N o , "" said Coyote, "" I shall
begin the singing of still another one,"" said he. Then again he began
the singing of another one, a very good song of his. This Coyote
had been fooling them just for fun with the song that he had first
sung.
   And then Coyote said, "" G o ahead I all of you go back home, each
to your own land, to there whence each of you has come."" "" A l l right,""
said they all, and scattered off towards their own lands. T h a t place
where they had danced turned into stone, and then from it trails
arose in all directions. I t is in this way that the Cry has come to
be. T h a t is what I have heard.

                            Editorial Notes   1. It is unlikely that all these names refer to bands in the political
sense. Others have recorded similar forms (see Kelly and Fowler 1986:
394-396).
   2. See M a p 1 for locations of these geographic designations.
   3. Sapir meant that Paiutes were no longer living there in 1910.
   4. We are unable to identify this place with certainty, but from the
evidence presented it may be Shem, the principal settlement on the
Shivwits Reservation.
   5. Sapir (1931k: 685) identifies this ""creek"" as the San Juan River
(see also Place Names, below). However, Southern Paiutes then were
and now are living along Hamblin Wash on the Navajo Reservation
northwest of Tuba City and near the San Juan River in Piute Canyon
northeast of Navajo Mountain. Kelly (1964) combined all of the
Southern Paiute populations south of the Colorado and San Juan rivers
into her ""San Juan Band."" Bunte and Franklin (1987) discuss the
ethnohistory of the group in depth.
   6. See Powell and Ingalls (1874, reprinted in Fowler and Fowler 1971:
98 — 104). Sapir seemingly requested clarification of the term recorded
by Powell as referring to Southern Paiute people ""east of the Colorado
River"" (Fowler and Fowler 1971: 104).
   7. Moapa Reservation, Nevada.
   8. Charleston Peak in the Spring Range, near Las Vegas, Nevada.
   9. Sapir added these two names to his list from the United States
Census, 1910. Kelly (1964: 31—36) has a similar list of neighboring
tribes.
   10. Probably Tony Tillohash's folk etymology.
   11. Sapir's notes originally identified the referents of this term as the
Mojave, another Yuman-speaking group. He bracketed that and added
""Walapai,"" but notes (1931k: 593 — 594) that the translation is probably
a folk etymology.
   12. Kelly (1964: 36) notes that ""Aiats"" is the name by which the
Mojave are known to the Shivwits and Moapa Paiutes. The Havasupai
were sometimes referred to as Coconino or Cosino (Kelly 1964: 35 — 36).
   13. ""Gentiles"" in local usage refers to non-Mormons.
   14. Cliff dwellings in Kanab Canyon were occupied prehistorically
by the Anasazi, ancestors of the Hopi. The Hopi refer to these ancestors
904                      X Soulhern   Paiute   and   Ute
as Hisätsinom. There are extensive panels of pictographs in Snake Gulch,
a tributary of Kanab Canyon.
   15. George served as a primary consultant to Kelly, but indicated
that he had been appointed chief by the Whites rather than in the old
way (Kelly 1964: 29).
   16. North of Kanab. In ascending order, the formations are locally
referred to as the Red (or Vermillion) Cliffs, White Cliffs, and Pink
Cliffs.
   17. See Kelly (1964) for location of some of these, as well as other
springs. The numbers given here may originally have been on maps now
lost, as Sapir refers in this list to topographic maps available in 1910.
   18. Reference to a topographic map available to Sapir in 1910. He
also refers to ""Kanab Sheet,"" ""Kaibab Sheet,"" and ""St. George Sheet,""
below.
   19. Now called Colorado City.
   20. Cane Beds, a place on the Arizona Strip.
   21. Now a uranium mine on the Arizona Strip south of the Kaibab
Paiute Reservation.
   22. Apparently New Mexico locust, Robinia neomexicana.
   23. Sapir gave no Paiute term for this. Kelly (1964: 8) gives ""Tinka-
nivac,"" or 'cave water', the same as Sapir's Number 17.
   24. Kelly (1964: 48), based on additional interviews on communal
hunting, suggests a point of clarification on this procedure: individuals
were stationed at divides or hollows in ridges where deer were likely to
go when pursued by the other hunters moving through the brush and
trees.
   25. Kelly's (1964: 50) data confirm Kaibab hunting of mountain sheep
in the Zion district, which includes Rockville and Orderville, but others
told her they were also taken on the rim of Grand Canyon.
   26. Kelly (1964: 48) and Stewart (1942: 240) confirm the lack of deer
fences and other enclosures for large game hunting. Stewart's (1942:
248) Kaibab consultants also denied the use of animal disguises, al-
though individuals from other Southern Paiute areas used them.
   27. Although a weapon used by some Ute groups, the thrusting spear
was not reported as used by Southern Paiutes interviewed by Stewart
(1942: 269).
   28. But see Sapir's earlier statement on distribution under ""Communal
Hunting.""
   29. Kelly (1964: 51) illustrates a curved rabbit stick attributed to a
model made by Tony Tillohash for Sapir. She also states that those she
                              Editorial   Notes                      905interviewed felt that the rabbit stick was ""recent,"" having been intro-
duced at the same time as the horse. Stewart's (1942: 336) data tend to
confirm this, with his consultant suggesting a Hopi source. Underhill
(1953: 113) illustrates four versions of the Hopi rabbit stick.
   30. A communal hunt with nets is confirmed by Kelly (1964: 50 — 51)
and Stewart (1942: 242), and is common in the Great Basin region.
   31. The desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida) would be near St. George.
It and the bushy-tailed woodrat (N. cinerea) occurred in the Kaibab
district. Kelly (1964: 52) was told by the Kaibab that both types were
taken.
   32. The plants listed here and under ""Medicinal Plants"" and ""Mis-
cellaneous Plants"" are identified in Table 2.
   33. To the west, the term arj w ibi is more commonly used for corn,
thus suggesting possibly two points of origin and diffusion for the corn
complex (Fowler and Fowler 1981).
   34. Probably Amaranthus blitoides, but tuupuibi was not ordinarily
cultivated. See Note 38 below.
   35. Wild sunflower is Helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus. Kelly (1964:
39) was told that the term for cultivated sunflower did not mean Hopi
sunflower, which seems unlikely.
   36. This technique differs from that of ditching irrigated garden plots
as described for the Southern Paiute to the west (St. George, Shivwits,
Moapa) by Kelly (1932 — 33) and seems closer to the planting techniques
of the Hopi.
   37. This is a reference to the piki of the Hopi, a paper-thin bread
baked on a griddle and rolled.
   38. Sapir apparently corrects the data by noting that töpu cl is not
cultivated, but the confusion continues. See Note 39, below.
   39. Sapir may be in error here, as the plant he describes, with both
a cultivated or white-seeded variety (Amaranthus hypochondriacus; A.
albus) and a wild or black-seeded variety (A. retroflexus, A. palmeri)
is called kumuti.
   40. These are more properly cicadas (Okanogoides spp.). Kelly (1964:
54) has additional data on insect collection.
   41. Sag w aadi is the chuckwalla (Sauromalus obesus), a common food
species in the hot desert areas of the Great Basin and southern Califor-
nia.
   42. Sapir is correct here in inferring the use of pottery for cooking
by the Kaibab. Kelly (1964: 77 — 78) adds more notes on its manufacture,
906                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
and it has been found in limited quantities archeologically in Kaibab
territory (Euler 1964: 379).
   43. Kelly (1964: 52) was told that the prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) did
not occur in Kaibab habitats. Tillohash may be referring to another
Southern Paiute area, or he may be speaking of a species of ground
squirrel (Spermophilus spp.).
   44. See ""Basketry.""
   45. Eagle aeries were private property, ordinarily owned by men
(Kelly 1964: 92). Boys often were lowered into the nests, as stated, but
probably under the direction of men rather than on their own.
   46. Although Stewart (1942: 243) confirms eagle capture from a
domed brush house, he says nothing about the requirement that war-
bonnet feathers be from live eagles. Given that eagles were kept alive
for taking feathers, this may be inferred, however.
   47. Kelly's (1964: 55) notes seem to confirm all of Tillohash's state-
ments on dogs.
   48. The size description seems to fit the Black-necked Stilt (Himan-
topus mexicanus); the coloration (""like a mocking bird""), the Wilson's
Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor).
   49. The plants suggested are: New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexi-
cana); serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia, A. utahensis)', black willow
(Salix gooddingii) or narrow-leaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia);
Osage orange (Maclura pomifera; introduced); and Gambel's oak (Quer-
cus gambelii).
   50. Kelly (1964: 73) illustrates the simple bow type and confirms this
statement. Recurved bows are visible in J. K. Hillers's photographs
from 1871, but principally for the Moapa-Las Vegas areas (Euler 1966:
Figures 45, 46; Fowler and Matley 1979: Figure 49e).
   51. Most shaft wrenches collected by J. W. Powell in the 1870s from
the southern Utah Southern Paiute, including the Kaibab, and now on
deposit in the United States National Museum of Natural History,
Smithsonian Institution, are of mountain sheep rather than antelope
horn.
   52. See Kelly (1964: Figure 10c) for an illustration of an arrow
supposedly drawn for Sapir by Tillohash.
   53. A common plant used for this was scouring rush (Equisetum spp.)
— unless a sandstone smoother is meant (see above).
   54. Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis).
   55. Fletching and shaft decoration on specimens collected by J. W.
Powell in the 1870s are treated in Fowler and Matley (1979: 150-151).
                              Editorial   Notes                        907   56. Incised lines are noted on the shafts collected by J. W. Powell and
deposited in the Smithsonian Institution (Fowler and Matley 1979: 64).
   57. Kelly (1964: 76) lists ringtail, fox, coyote, lion or fawn skin for
quivers in addition to wildcat or bobcat. Three southern Utah Southern
Paiute quivers from the J. W. Powell collection are illustrated by Fowler
and Matley (1979: 155).
   58. Kelly (1964: 76 — 77) describes both the slow match and the fire
hearth and drill.
   59. The shape was said to be tubular for the Kaibab (Stewart 1942:
293). A slightly curving but basically tubular pipe of Kaibab manufac-
ture was collected by J. W. Powell (Fowler and Matley 1979: 165).
   60. Nicotiana attenuata.
   61. J. W. Powell collected one ""tan soapstone"" pipe among the
Kaibab, although most of the others he collected are green (Fowler and
Matley 1979: 73).
   62. See Kelly (1964: 78ff.) and Fowler and Matley (1979) for technical
descriptions and illustrations of common Southern Paiute baskets.
   63. I.e., coiled. Ciuv wl 'squawbush' is skunk bush (Rhus aromatica
var. trilobata).
   64. Both the close coiled and the open twined burden baskets are
described here. Both types are documented in the literature (Kelly 1964:
79, 84). A close twined conical seed collecting basket was also made
and called by the same term.
   65. Coiled basket caps are known from Moapa but, according to
Kelly (1964: 83), are not reported from the Kaibab.
   66. Undoubtedly devil's claw (Proboscidea parviflora), the split fruits
of which are used in basketry.
   67. J. W. Powell collected baskets from this area in 1872 with over-
painting used to enhance woven designs.
   68. This should read ""stripped out by hand,"" as no implement was
used.
   69. Kelly (1964: 84) discusses cradle styles and also illustrates typical
examples collected.
   70. Milkweed is Asclepias sp., probably A. fascicularis, Mexican
milkweed. Dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum) was also used by the
Kaibab (Kelly 1964: 81).
   71. Kelly (1964: 71) illustrates the handle for this type of blade, based
on a sketch made by Sapir.
   72. Kelly (1964: 71) suggests that in the first application, brains are
put on both sides; in the second, usually on the hair side only.
908                       X Southern   Paiute and Ute
   73. In a sentence above, Sapir suggests that there are three applica-
tions. Kelly (1964: 71) indicates two.
   74. Plants are identified as follows: wa c ap'°, common juniper (Juni-
perus communis) and Utah juniper (J. utahensis); s-ö'vip'° Fremont
cottonwood (Populus fremontii); qwiyav0, Gambel oak (Quercus gam-

rose (Rosa woodsii).
   75. I.e., rose hip.
   76. See ""Arrows"" for the suggestion that currant arrows also need to
be greased.
   77. The buckskin clothing here described may be of relatively late
introduction to the Southern Paiute, i.e., 1860s. Kelly (1964: 5 9 - 6 5 )
suggests that the Plains styles may have replaced the more common
skirts or dresses of bark after the introduction of guns and horses.
   78. Most of the shirts photographed by J. K. Hillers in the 1870s for
the Powell expedition reach mid-thigh. However, some of these may be
of Ute manufacture, and in use only for the photographic sessions
(Fowler and Matley 1979: 30).
   79. map'"" is cliff-rose (Purshia mexicana).
   80. Various other caps are pictured in the Hillers photographs from
other Southern Paiute areas (Fowler and Matley 1979). Some are in the
J. W. Powell collection in the Smithsonian Institution.
   81. Women's moccasins often have high tops, reaching to mid- or
upper calf, and thus serving as leg protectors (Fowler and Matley 1979:
130).
   82. Presumably ""overcast""; however, this is rarely observed on moc-
casins collected in the area (Fowler and Matley 1979).
   83. Kelly (1964: 64) also illustrates a moccasin with separate tongue,
although those in the Powell collection from the area rarely have such
(Fowler and Matley 1979: 3Iff.).
   84. This paragraph appeared elsewhere in the manuscript, but it
reinforces several points. Stewart (1942) also notes lack of moccasin
decoration.
   85. This description is less than clear, as there is no indication of how
the twisting is accomplished (e.g., on the thigh, with the hands, etc.). If
both of the strips are turned in the same direction, the result would be
                              Editorial   Notes                      909one long strip with the same direction of twist. If not, they would twist
around each other producing a two-ply piece, which seems not to be
intended.
   86. This number seems unusually low. The figure of 15, given above,
seems closer.
   87. Braided hair dressing for men was also claimed by Kelly's (1964:
65) Kaibab consultants, although few braids are to be seen in Hillers's
photographs from the 1870s. This style may have come from the Ute
in the late nineteenth century.
   88. The whereabouts of the various ""models"" made by Tillohash is
unknown. They were apparently not accessioned at the University
Museum, University of Pennsylvania (Alessandro Pezzati, Archivist,
personal communication, January 1989).
   89. This practice was common among the Ute (Stewart 1942: 279).
   90. The feather bonnets shown in the Hillers photographs are prob-
ably an affectation for photographic purposes (Fowler and Matley 1979:
138).
   91. nänt' is Agave utahensis. The leaf fibers were used as a comb.
   92. The statement implies that the beads were contained in the earlobe
and not suspended from a string.
   93. The Powell collection from the Kaibab includes bird-bone and
claw necklaces as well as one made of Olivella shells.
   94. This house is larger than those seen in the Hillers photographs
(e.g., Fowler and Matley 1979: Figure 57), but houses were generally
built to accommodate the number of family members (Kelly 1964: 56).
   95. Kelly (1964: 58) suggests Ute introduction, sometime between the
1870s and 1900. See also Euler (1966).
   96. See Sapir's Ute notes that follow. Reference is probably to the
tripod or conical house (Stewart 1942: 257).
   97. Kelly's (1964: 59) consultants denied the use of sweat houses,
relating a single event in which such use resulted in a death. Both Ute
and Navajo neighbors used them extensively, however. The sweat house
described suggests the Navajo type (Stewart 1942: 259).
   98. Sapir seems to correct this form to tcäcix y an"" in the section on
""Birth,"" translating naxan"" as 'whore house'.
   99. Kelly (1964: 98) gives additional menstrual observances.
   100. näxan"" is said above to refer to menstrual hut. Sapir (1931k:
576) gives nai-xanl, na.-xanl 'house of prostitution' from stem nai-s 'to
have sexual connection, to mate'.
910                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
   101. Sapir (1930e: 375) recorded from Tillohash the tale of how
Coyote set birth customs.
   102. According to Stewart (1942: 306), the cord is placed in a special
skin pouch and attached to the child's cradle. It is later disposed of in
a way appropriate to the child's sex so that the child will benefit later
in life.
   103. Stewart's (1942: 305) data seem to confirm this for the Kaibab,
but not all Southern Paiute.
   104. Possibly the Rock Wren (Salpinctes obsoletus).
   105. Kelly (1964: 101) was told that cremation was reserved for
""mean"" people.
   106. Both lists show some terminological inconsistencies with other
published schedules (e.g., Kelly 1964). Because Tillohash was orphaned
and partly raised by a Mormon family, he may not have been familiar
with the full range of lexical items in this domain.
   107. In the historic period, Southern Paiute people were enslaved by
the Navajo and sold by Ute and Navajo to Mexicans in Santa Fe (Euler
1966).
   108. Sapir (1931k: 685), however, later translates the form as 'Acorn(?)
man's name'.
   109. Sapir is probably checking for a minimal pair here rather than
recording an additional name.
   110. These are all the political data Sapir recorded in 1910. For a
fuller account see Kelly (1964: 26 — 30), and for an ethnohistorical
reconstruction of bands and ""chiefs"" see Euler (1966: 99 — 104).
   111. Kelly (1964: 133 — 142) presents data on religion, some of which
she says ""comes from Sapir's notes."" Some are not found in the 1910
ethnographic notes which we have and could be in other Sapir notes of
which we are unaware; however, see the introduction for comments on
the Sapir notes available to Kelly. There is nothing here that is contra-
dicted by Kelly, and Sapir's notes are much fuller than Kelly's section
on Kaibab religion. See also Kelly (1939).
   112. Compare with Kelly (1964: 140-141).
   113. Kelly (1939: 151) remarked that a shaman was ""never a young
woman ... in a list of twenty shamans, only two were women.""
   114. In 1776, when the first party of Europeans to see Paiutes were
camped near the Paria River, an elderly Paiute shaman attempted to
cure one of the ill Spaniards by singing over him at night. In 1854, a
Mormon missionary wrote about Paiute shamans curing by sucking on
the patient's body (Euler 1966: 111).
                                       Editorial   Notes                911   115. The motif of a world underground where everything is opposite
to this world is known generally among the Southern Paiute and Great
Basin peoples.
   116. Kelly (1939: 153) reported three Kaibab shamans who specialized
in curing rattlesnake bites. Her belief that the plant used was of the
g e n u s Ligusticum   is c o r r e c t ; it is Ligusticum   porteri.
   117. A Hopi Indian.
   118. This is a much more complete account of the mourning ceremony
than that given by Kelly (1964) and by Sapir (1912c).
   119. This is true also of the mourning songs sung by Havasupai and
Walapai.
   120. Probably among the Mojave or other lower Colorado River
Yumans.
   121. This figure is undoubtedly exaggerated; Kaibab Paiutes never
had that many horses to sacrifice.
   122. Shivwits Paiute.
   123. Kelly (1964: 85) illustrates such a rattle made by Tillohash for
Sapir in 1910.
   124. Usually referred to as Captain Pete.
   125. In Arizona east of the present Kaibab Paiute Reservation.
   126. Skutumpah Ranch is near the head of Johnson Canyon northeast
of Kanab.
   127. The meaning of this sentence is obscure. It may mean that the
mountain sheep group was formed of others who were neither ""coyotes""
nor ""birds""; or it may mean that there were other unaffiliated groups
of singers present.
   128. There are no Southern Paiute drums among the ethnographic
specimens collected by Powell in the 1870s (Fowler and Matley 1979:
72). Kelly (1964: 85) lists as musical instruments only the Cry Dance
rattle and the Bear Dance rasp, both late arrivals.
   129. Cane Beds, Arizona, west of the Kaibab Paiute Reservation.
   130. We are unable to identify this place with certainty, but it may
be Shem, the population and agency center on the Shivwits Reservation.
Lacking a mid front vowel, Southern Paiute speakers often substitute
[a] in their English. Similarly [s ] does not occur initially and may be
reflected as [s]. Sapir was not familiar with Utah place names, as the
manuscript suggests.
   131. Little is known about Kaibab Paiute participation in the 1890
Ghost Dance movement. Kelly (1964: 106 — 107) relied upon Sapir's
912                     X Southern   Paiute and Ute
notes for her data. Sapir's data are minimal, since Tillohash apparently
had only seen or heard about it as a small child.
   132. The central pole was part of the Northern Paiute version of this
dance, from which all others were adopted (Jorgensen 1986). The use
of a cane as a substitute may be uniquely Southern Paiute, perhaps
representing the canes a number of Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi
men commonly carried as a mark of status (see for example, Laird
1976).
   133. Kelly's (1964: 120-121) statements about mythology are mostly
from Sapir's notes.
   134. Sapir (1930e: 4 0 8 - 4 1 0 ) records this tale.
   135. See Liljeblad (1986) for discussion of this class of spirits.
   136. Sapir (1930e: 464 — 471) records this tale. The bird's name is
literally 'person carrier', but it is described as being a bird.
   137. The string around the vagina is a common mythic theme in
southern California.
   138. For more on the quality of voices of animal actors see Sapir
(1910d).
   139. Again, this mythic theme is well known in the region.
   140. Powell records the same theme (Fowler and Fowler 1971).
   141. Kelly (1964: 134-135) gives additional data.
   142. Kelly (1964: 136) gives a table correlating these data on month
names with those she received in 1933.
   143. These four are the names of song cycles for the Cry or Mourning
Ceremony.
   144. Kelly (1964: 107ff.) discusses a number of details on the Bear
Dance and its introduction to the Kaibab from the Ute. She uses Sapir's
account as background.
   145. Above, Sapir describes the position of the hands as not on the
shoulders but behind the waist. Kelly (1964:109) also notes discrepancies
in hand positions.
   146. By 1915, Lowie (1924: 299) was able to witness a Bear Dance
involving Shivwits people and locals at Moapa. He was told that the
dance had been adopted three or four years before.
   147. Hillers photographed Paiute round dances near Kanab, Utah
about 1872 (Euler 1966: Appendix I, page 5, and Figure 24; Steward
1939, Plates 7 and 8).
   148. Kelly's (1964: 98) data confirm lack of a dance for girls at
puberty.
                              Editorial   Notes                       913   149. The implication is that the hiding side does sing. Kelly (1964:
114) was told that both sides sang at once. Culin (1907: 312) states that
the hiding team chants first, followed by the guessing team.
   150. In each pair of bones, one is marked in the center, usually with
a wrapping of buckskin or pitch-covered twine (Fowler and Matley
1979: 159). The position of the unmarked bones is guessed as indicated
in the statement below.
   151. I.e., the hiding team.
   152. Kelly (1964: 114) suggests that this statement may refer to the
version played with two bones —one held by each of two players.
Normally a bone would be in each hand in the four-bone version.
   153. Kelly (1964: 113) says seven counters were preferred. Stewart
(1942: 286) indicates that there were ten per side.
   154. Notes on the stick dice game were recorded by Sapir on three
separate occasions and contain two corrections. They are left as recorded
rather than rewritten to reflect the corrections, to illustrate that Sapir
apparently returned to some topics on occasion to cross-check infor-
mation. Kelly (1964: 114) illustrates stick dice apparently made for Sapir
by Tillohash.
   155. This probably refers to the scoring procedure for the cup and
ball game, described below.
   156. We are uncertain as to which game Sapir refers to here. It may
be the four stick game, which Culin (1907: 334) records for the Southern
Paiute, based on notes and specimens collected by J. W. Powell. It was
played by men only.
   157. Although not the same scoring method, Sapir refers to the use
of the same principle in his account of the dice game.
   158. The term ""cedar"" is popularly used in this region for juniper
{Juniperus spp.).
   159. Kelly (1964) does not mention this. Stewart (1942: 285) lists its
occurrence only among the San Juan Southern Paiute.
   160. See ""Rabbit Hunting."" This game, described to C. Fowler in the
1960s, was said often to result in injuries to horses and riders.
   161. Stewart (1942: 290) also notes the seeming absence among the
Southern Paiute of string figures.
   162. Stewart (1942: 290) lists foot races as present among the Kaibab
and does not note them as ""recent.""
   163. Stewart (1942: 290) lists stilts as ""recent"" among the Kaibab but
aboriginal among his other Southern Paiute groups.
914                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
   164. Although identified by Sapir as huckleberry, this is undoubtedly
the referent for blue elderberry (Sambucus caerulea).
   165. See section on ""Arrow Shoots"" under ""Games of Skill"" for a
similar adult game.
   166. Kelly (1964: 119) illustrates a bull-roarer, apparently made for
Sapir by Tillohash.
   167. These few notes were scattered throughout Sapir's field notebook.
They are grouped here as a miscellaneous category.
   168. Kelly (1964: 133) repeats this and gives but little information on
""greetings.""
   169. Sapir notes here ""Cree on authority of Skinner-Speck."" Skinner
is Alanson B. Skinner, and Speck is Frank G. Speck, both of whom
worked among the Cree.
   170. See Calloway, Janetski, and Stewart (1986: 338-339, 365-366)
for similar group names. Not all given here can be easily traced to those
known most commonly in the literature (Map 2).
   171. This is undoubtedly from ""Weber,"" as in Weber County in north-
central Utah. This particular group, known popularly as ""Weber Utes,""
was Shoshone-speaking, as Sapir correctly notes.
   172. Groups now on the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming.
   173. The Gosiutes speak a dialect of Shoshone. The Paviotso referred
to here are from the western Great Basin and speak a related but
different language than either ""Ute-Paiute"" (Ute) or Shoshone (Miller
1986).
   174. The identity of this group is unknown. Herbert Ariv's entry,
below, may indicate that they are Pueblo.
   175. Stewart (1942: 240) confirms all of these techniques.
   176. See also the account of this activity in the Kaibab notes.
   177. Smith (1974: 49) refers to the making of pemmican by the Utes.
   178. See Hillers's photographs of what may be drying platforms in
Ute camps in the early 1870s (Fowler and Fowler 1971: 52, 54). Smith
(1974: 67 — 68) gives only Sapir's account.
   179. These three foods are: Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), thistle
(Cirsium sp.), and serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia, A. utahensis).
   180. Stewart (1942: 244) was told by his Timpanogots and Pahvant
consultants that coyote was eaten. His Uintah consultants, however,
confirmed all the food taboos given here.
   181. The Utes had been involved in trade with the Mexicans since at
least the early 1700s (Calloway, Janetski, and Stewart 1986).
                              Editorial   Notes                       915   182. Smith (1974: 8 3 - 8 9 ) discusses data on Ute pottery-making. One
of her consultants confirmed the use of prickly pear cactus leaves as
temper.
   183. Smith (1974: 89ff.) gives an account of the common Ute basket
types. Her description matches most of the types given here, although
there is some minor terminological confusion.
   184. Smith (1974: 80ff.) gives an account in depth of the tanning
process.
   185. I.e., cottontail. The account that follows of making rabbit-skin
blankets clearly assigns this technology to the Great Basin.
   186. Sapir and J. Alden Mason observed these designs at dances at
Whiterocks, Utah, in 1909. The list is the most extensive account known
of Ute facial decoration.
   187. Smith (1974: 37 — 42) also discusses the details of tepee construc-
tion.
   188. See Hillers's photographs of Ute summer brush houses as repro-
duced in Steward (1939) and Fowler and Fowler (1971).
   189. This very extensive list, with its Shoshone comparisons, probably
from the same consultant, is far more complete than any published
since.
   190. Also known as ""water babies"" elsewhere in the Great Basin
(Liljeblad 1986).
   191. See Jorgensen (1986) for accounts of all these dances. The Bear
Dance is particularly well known for the Ute.
   192. See Vennum (1986). This is apparently a form of the Plains
Grass Dance.

   Works appearing in The Collected Works of Edward Sapir are designated by
a roman numeral, referring to the appropriate volume, at the end of the entry.","[903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 910, 911, 912, 913, 914, 915, 916, 917, 918, 919, 920, 921]"
"   Post-nominal pronouns (or article-pronouns) are identical in form
with the shorter forms of certain of the independent third personal
pronouns (or demonstratives). T h e y are closely attached, though
not as phonetically amalgamated enclitics, to preceding nouns,
participles, adjectives, numerals, and pronouns, which they serve
to make clearly denominating terms. Frequently they hold together
a group of two or more words as a denominative unit, in which case
they may stand after the first word of the group instead of at the end.
T h e y are practically equivalent to postposed articles and are differ-
entiated according to number, visibility and invisibility, animate and
inanimate, and, to some extent, case. On the whole, case distinctions
are neglected and primarily subjective forms often function also as
objectives. This seems to indicate a tendency towards development
into true articles. Ordinarily an article-pronoun follows immediately
upon the denominating term, but sometimes an intervening enclitic
(pronominal or other) element separates the two, e. g.
qana'ritsnjwi'aq·      um'i    KANAB-PEOPLE-OBJ.-IT     (INV.)   THEY   (INV.),   THE

  The corresponding objective form is also regularly ayA, which
replaces theoretical aya'tA. Examples are:

  For ayA = ami, see 2 below.
  An unexplained variant of ayA is aywA, apparently used only after
objective forms, e. g.:

   Far less often A'qa'iA, a more properly pronominal form, is used as
objective inanimate visible article-pronoun, e.g.:

correspondent of 'aiA (7 above) is 'oa'iA, 'wa'i.i, a properly demonstra-

   Related to 'oa'iA as A qa'iA is to 'a'iA (7 above) is u'qwa'iA, which

  There are four demonstrative stems, as already noted (§ 39, 1):
                                       w
a- THAT (indefinite); i-,  THIS; ma-, m a'- THAT (visible; referred
to); and u-, "" V - that (invisible). These stems are not directly
used as independent demonstratives (except for rather infrequently
employed adverbs; a·, ma·'; see § 60, 2, d; 3), but need to be combined
with other elements. The following types of demonstrative usage
may be recognized:   ( 1 ) DEMONSTRATIVE STEMS FOLLOWED BY POSTPOSITIONS.  These
are extremely common and correspond, in function, to inanimate
demonstrative pronoun + postposition. Examples are:
ava"" that-at, there (indefinite)
aru'q-WA that-under, under it
maru'x-WA that (vis.)-to, to it
mava""anA that (vis.)-on, on it
mwa'va' that-at, there (not far away)
ι(y)t'nu this-at, here, present ( < i- a'n u-)
'i'va this-at, here
'i'upathis-through,     in this direction
uvwa"", 'u'vwax that (inv.)-at, there (inv.)
o 'p a'"" (< u-u'p-a'""), °'o'xpa'a (<       'u'-up-a'"") t h a t ( i n v . ) - t h r o u g h , in
  yonder direction  ( 2 ) DEMONSTRATIVE     STEMS +     THIRD PERSON            PRONOMINAL              ELE-
MENTS. These forms function as independent third personal pro-
nouns (§ 39, 1); as article-pronouns (§ 42); and as enclitic third per-
sonal pronouns (§ 40, 1). There is nothing further to be said about
them here except to note once more that these personal demonstratives
often preserve their proper demonstrative force.
   ( 3 ) V E R B S OF DOING. These are nothing but derivatives in -n i-
(§ 26,2, b) of the demonstrative stems. The idea of DOING, ACTING fre-

           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                   205quently passes over into that of HAVING SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ONE,
BEING. The verbs of doing are: an i- TO DO (indefinitely); mani'-,
mya'n i- τ ο DO (as indicated); in i'-, 'i'n-i- το DO IN THIS MANNER;
un i-, 'u'n i- τ ο DO IN THAT (narrated, unseen) MANNER. Examples
of these verbs are:

'u'n ivä p i do-future-passive partic., about to be done to  In their absolute form verbs of doing frequently function as ad-
verbs of manner. In this capacity they may be combined with
forms of similar morphology that serve as verbs of doing. Examples
are:
a'n i in that (indef.) way

  (4) SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.      From the demonstrative stems o- and
224                          X Southern Paiute and Ute
      206                               SAPIR      u- are formed the verbs of being: aro'a- το be (vis.) and uru'a- το
      be (inv.). See § 56, 1.
        (5) ai-, mai-. These are extended forms of demonstrative a- and
      ma-. They are used as independent inanimate demonstrative pro-
      nouns, particularly with verbs of saying, (talking, hearing). However,
      they are not ordinarily found except followed by pronominal enclitics.
      Their objective forms are aia·, maia- (probably < a-ya-, ma-ya-).
      As to usage, ai- is best translated as t h a t (indefinite), mai- as t h a t
      (quoted, referred to).
        Examples of subjective ai- are:
      a'inl nayqa'q aip ini that-my heard (partic.)-my, that (is) what I
         heard
      a'i(y)aq-A qu'qo'qwikanayum aRi that-it (vis.) shoot (distributively)-
         plural-verbal noun-your (plur.) it (vis.), that (is) it which you
         (plur.) shoot at
        Examples of objective aia- are:
      a'ian 'a'imi      that (obj.)-I say- usitative, that's what I always say
      a'ia y (fir 'a'imi' that (obj.)-he (vis.) indeed say-usitative, that's
         what he indeed always says
      'a'i 'iy'ir 'aik^A that (obj.)-thou indeed said, that indeed you said
          (for 'ai < 'aia', see § 40, 2)
        Curiously enough, objective aia- becomes ai- before the inter-
      rogative, the two elements combining as aitcu'a-, aintcu'a-, e. g.:
      a'itcnan (or a'infcuan) a'ik ?A that (obj.)-interrogative-I said, did
         I say that?
      a'intcua r) 'a'imi' that (obj.)-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is
         he wont to say that? does he really mean that?
         Subjective mai- is illustrated in:
      ma'in n\ni nar/qa'qaip'ini that (quoted)-my me heard (partic.)-my,
        that's what I heard
      mai'm imi nayqa'q ainA that-thy thee hearing, that's what you hear
        Examples of objective maia- are:
      ma'ian 'aik *A that I say
      ma'i(y) 'iy'ir 'a'ik -Λ that indeed thou sayest (mai < maia' as above)
        Parallel to maia- is m""a'ia-, e. g.:
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language
            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    207mwa'iAcampa ay 'aik--A that (obj.)-only-he say, that's all he says
u w
 m a'iAcampan niruyw ampa'xA that -(obj.)-only-me I-to talk, that
  only talk to me! stop talking to me!
   As we have already seen, aia- is also used as inanimate visible
objective article-pronoun: 'α'ΪΑ (§ 42, 7). Its parallel invisible 'oa'iA
(probably < u-a-ya-) is not used as independent demonstrative,
though it must be such in origin. For adverbial-connective use of
ai-, see § 60, 2, a; for 'οα'ΪΑ as modal adverb, see § 60, 3.
   (6) VERBS OF SAYING. Parallel to the demonstratives ai- and radi-
äre the verbs of saying: ai- το SAY (indefinitely) and mai- (mwa'ia-)
                                               u w
TO SAY THAT (which has been quoted); e. g. qatc m a' iar/wai' yucampA
NOT SAY-THAT-NEGATIVE-SUBORDINATING-ONLY,          ALTHOUGH NOT SAY-
ING THAT. Either these verbs result from composition with demon-
strative α-, ma- (m w a'-); or they are merely verbified forms of demon-
strative ai- and mat-.
                            Note on § § 39-43.
   The three classes of pronouns already discussed observe the dis-
tinction in the third person between visible (or present) and invisible
(or absent) forms. Nevertheless sentences occur, as may have been
noticed, in which the same person or object is designated now as
visible, now as invisible. To a large extent this seems to be due to a
desire to prevent the same phonetic group (""word"") from containing
both a visible and an invisible element (see, for combinations of
two enclitics, § 41, 1, e), but not entirely. Apparently the difference
between the two sets of forms tends to become a formal rather than
a strictly functional matter. Examples of such contradictory
sentences are:
imi'ntcu'a-ijA pini'Rai'iijWA   tiyi'vw'ia'm u'IJWA thou-interrogative-
   him (vis.) see-him (inv.) friend-obj.-thy he (inv.; = him), did you
   see your friend (inv.)?
toy^o'iMuHaqaifwaiyquywA       qu'qwi'tιιαηΑ      right-forehead-on-obj.-
   his (inv.) shoot-impersonal-him (vis.), (if) anybody shoots him
   right on his forehead
tava'iA mwa'vaq-A qan'juqWA        sun (obj.) there-it (vis.) sit-when-it
    (inv.), when the sun sets there                     § 44. Interrogative pronouns.
  Interrogative stems may he divided into two groups, those employed
denominatively (interrogative pronouns proper) and those employed
                       X Southern Paiute and Ute
208                                SAPiRadverbially or serving as base for adverbial forms. They are not
accompanied by the interrogative enclitic -ru'a- (§ 19, 2, f).
  ( 1 ) D E N O M I N A T I V E FORMS. Four or five denominative stems are
found: aya-, ini-, impi-, and αηια-; further ay a-, which is always
verbalized or adverbialized by suffixed elements.
  (a) arja- WHO? This interrogative refers to persons only. Its
objective form is ayaia-; its subjective plural is ayami- (see § 48, 1),
objective ayam'ia-. I t must not be confused with αηα- H E , THAT
ONE (§ 39). I t is perhaps to avoid this confusion that interrogative
aya- is apparently never used with postpositions; e. g. aya'ruxwA
denotes το HIM, not το WHOM?. The latter idea would have to be
expressed periphrastically (see § 50, 8). Examples of αηα- are:
ay aru""a who is? who is it?
ay aro""avi iyA who would-be this-one? I wonder who this is!
'ay an i'lc -A who does-so? who is it that does so?
at) aije- αηιρα'χαχα who says talking? who is that talking? (referring
   to one who is heard but not seen)
aya'i aro"""" whom ( = whose) is? whose is it? (contrast aya'iac-

ayam,· aro""a who (plur.) are? who are they?
aya'm'iantca' pAxqa'yu whom (plur.)- preterit-thou kill? whom (2)
   did you kill?
  (b) in i-' WHO? WHAT? OF WHAT SORT? This is a generalized
animate interrogative pronoun, referring to an animal, an animate
being not known to be definitely human or animal, or a person of
undefined characteristics. Subjective in-i- sometimes appears as
unelided ini before aro'a- το BE. Its objective singular is inia-·,
subjective plural in iyw'i- (see § 48, 1), objective iniyw'ia-. Examples
are:
in- aro' i'y.i what is this (anim.)?
in i aro""a what is it (anim.)?
ini'ntcan niywu'runl     who-preterit-me person-make-me? who ever
   made me a peron? who ever respected me?
iniyw aro""a what (plur.) are? what are they (animals)?
ini'ywi aro"""" what (plur. obj.) are? to what (animals) does it belong?
  (c) impi-' WHAT (inanimate); objective imp'ia-. In all probability
impi- is connected with in i-·, for -pi- see nominalizing suffix -ρ-'i-, § 25,

WITH) ; it may also be used as a nominal base for verbal derivatives,
e. g. impi'yai- τ ο HAVE WHAT? impuru- τ ο MAKE WHAT? Examples
of imp'i- are:
imp ατο""α what is it (vis.)?
imp uru""a what is it (inv.)?
imp'i'a rjA fi'qa'va' what (obj.)-he (vis.) eat-shall? what will he eat
imp'i'ma' fiya'nivani       what-with-thou butcher-will? what will you
  butcher with?
imp'i'xai' what hast thou?
impu'ruyiarjA      what is he making?
   (d) ania- WHAT? This interrogative is used only as the object
of verbs of saying or mental activity, e. g.:
'ani'an 'aik -Λ what-I say? what did I say?
im αη ιΑ nan o'c ivätcf thou what being-wont-to-dream? what have
   you ever dreamt?
ani'a' cy.via 'i' what-thou think-present? what are you thinking of?
   Aside from its use as an interrogative pronoun, an ia- frequently
appears as a verb, ΤΟ SAY WHAT? AS such it is treated analogously to
ai- TO SAY. Examples are:
im 'ani'avatci thou wont-to-say-what? what are you accustomed to
  say?
an i Axqa r)A what did he (vis.) say? (for -qa- see § 32, 2)
'ani'axai' a'ik-?A say-what-subordinating-thou say-so? for what
   reason do you say so?
ani'ayuntca' riiru'x-WA say-what-momentaneous-preterit-thoii I-to?

  With enclitic -nia- LIKE (§ 19, 2, d) this verb means το CARE FOR
WHAT? e. g. rii' and Λ'qanC WHAT DO I CARE?   With enclitic -c u- AGAIN
(§ 19, 2, k) and followed by ai- τ ο SAY, pronominal 'an ia- denotes
                          x

PLURAL-USITATIVE?             YE ARE WONT TO TEASE ME.","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227]"
"  (2) V E R B A L USE OF POSTPOSITIONS. All postpositions indicating
movement, also some indicating presence, may be and frequently are
verbified without further change in form. Formal verbal suffixes (e. g.
momentaneous -yu- and tense elements) are directly suffixed to the
postposition. Examples of such verbified uses are:
au'mituywa'a       it-back-from-thou! go out (of it)!
U
  'u'x-upa""p-'iya'      it (inv.)-through (-wpa-)-past; (he) went off
    through it (inv.), in yonder direction
uywa""vantiiywa.T)UpiyaK he (inv.)-on-to-momentaneous-past, (he)
    got on top of him
axa'va ntuxwa'"" what-at-to-thou? where are you going to?
nar/wa""aimiku p'iya'aim'i         self-with-movement-inceptive-past-dual,
    (they) 2 started to go along together
qa'tcu maa'n%T]wa'aik wA not that (vis.)-at-negative-it (inv.), was
    not there
   All postpositions may be participialized by means of -ft-"" (§ 25, 6,
a); e. g. -va nti-, obj. -va-nfia-, BEING AT ( - v a • - "" AT). Such participial-
ized postpositions are often employed where simple local phrases or
adverbs would appear in English, e. g. H E GATHERED STICKS THAT-
                     w                                                     w
AT-BEING-OBJ. (uv a'ntiA) instead of simply THAT-AT, THERE (vv a"").
Sometimes the participial form takes on a specialized significance;
e. g. U'VIA IT-ON, THEREON, THEREAT, but umu'a!nt'i (obj. umwa'ntiA)
BEING THEREAT, i. e. SOME OF IT. Participialized postpositions may
be followed by other postpositions, e. g. -va nfi-m a-nayqwa- AT-
BEING-ON-FROM, AWAY FROM.",[236]
"   A few remarks on verbs of doing and saying are all we need offer
here. As numerous examples scattered through this paper have
already shown, verbs of doing and saying are frequently used in
Paiute in a wider sense than is customary in English. Verbs of
doing, i. e. verbs in -n i- (§ 26, 2, b; § 43, 3; § 44, 2, a), often refer, in a
loose manner, to any activity or state but those of speech, sound,
and mental operation. A correspondingly loose reference to activi-
ties and states of the latter sort is made by verbs of saying (ui- and
mai-, § 43, 6). Thus, un i- τ ο DO and ai- το SAY are equivalently
used in expressions in -n-a-c-u-(vw'i~) (ONE'S OWN) — I N G AGAIN imply-
ing continuous and exclusive activity, e. g.:tTqa'n-Acuv %ni'kiA he keeps on eating (lit., does his own eating again)
Α%ρϊ'inac-u(a)n iini'k ~A I do nothing but sleep
qa 'nA'cuv"" a'ip 'iya' he kept on singing, did nothing but sing (lit.,
   said his own singing again)   ( 1 ) V E R B S OF DOING. Further examples of the generalized use

   ( 4 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF PARTICIPLES.    Participles are extremely in
evidence in Paiute. They are employed in a variety of syntactic
ways:
   (a) Attributively, when they may often be translated as relative
clauses or as adjectives.
   (b) Denominatively, e. g. to'ywant'i FIGHTING > FIGHTER, second-
arily HAVASUPAI INDIAN; uvwa-'nt aRi THERE-BEING IT, THE THING
THAT IS THERE.
   (c) Adverbially, particularly with verbalized postpositional forms,
e. g. tümpwi'a-ij 'am-nÜA p\rn'ka ROCK-OBJ.- HE (VIS), IT-AT-BEING-
OBJ. LOOK, i. e. HE LOOKS THERE AT THE ROCK rather than H E SEES THE
ROCK THAT IS THERE.
    (d) Predicatively after verbs, particularly substantive verbs, e. g.
t'itc aro""ami ayan an-i'ntci THIS (INAN.) IS-USITATIVE HOW DOING?
HOW DOES IT WORK? qatcu an ik- %ijwaTjw'ait 'i NOT DOES RAINING
(NEG.), IT DOES NOT RAIN.
   (e) In lieu of finite verbs, particularly after independent personal
pronouns. Such participles may be considered as special cases of
predicative usages (d), the substantive verb being omitted. They
refer to general time as a rule. Examples are:
a'imintim'i say-usitative-participle-plural, (those) wont to say, (they)
   always say
rii' to'ywanii I fighting, I am a fighter
i'mi cii'xaxwai't-uim-inünl    thou squaw-bush-get-go-causative-usita-
    tive-participle-me, you always cause ine to go to get squaw-bush
    twigs
   ( 5 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF ADJECTIVES.      Practically all adjectives are
properly verbal in form. As such, they may be predicatively em-
ployed, like any verb; or, in participial form, attributively or de-
nominatively (e.g. ""'a't 'i tiyo'qwdci     GOOD-BEING RUNNING, GOOD
RUNNER). They may also be employed, in their bare stem-form,
as the first, rarely second, elements of noun compounds (see § 18, 1, d
and e).
   A few adjectives are properly nominal in form, e. g. imaf'p'its·

   ( 1 ) FORMATION     OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.      Substantive verbs are
formed from the demonstrative stems a- and u- by means of a verbal-
izing -ro'a-: am'α- το BE (vis.), uru'a- το BE (inv.). These forms may
be used with all nouns, animate or inanimate, and independent
pronouns. These simple forms are also used as the nucleus of a
set of substantive verbs of specific pronominal reference, composed
of the pronouns urjwa- HE, um-'C- THEY, and uru- IT, to which are
respectively appended (not phonetically suffixed) aro'a- for the visible,
uru'a- for the invisible, forms. I t is remarkable that the u- pronouns,
which are properly invisible, should be used in visible substantive
verbs as well, visibility and invisibility being expressed by the a- or u-
of the verb proper. The pronominal substantive verbs thus are:urjw aro'a-   h e is (vis.)                uy uru'a-     h e is (inv.)
umw aro'a- they are (vis.)                 urn uru'a- they are (inv.)
ur aro'a- it is (vis.)                     ur uru'a- it is (inv.)   These may be conveniently written as single words, e. g. uraro'a-
IT is (VIS.). The present tense of substantive verbs is designated
either by the normal -y'i- (§ 32, 1) or, more frequently, by the
absence of a tense suffix. The substantive verb may also take on
other tense suffixes, the modal -νϊ - (§ 33, 2), the usitative suffixes
(§ 30, 10 and 11), the participial -η-, and the nominal abstract
-na-  (§ 25, 3).","[265, 266, 267]"
"   (3) PERIPHRASTIC CONSTRUCTIONS WITH POSTPOSITIONS.           While
postpositions may be used with noun stems (e. g. qani'ntcuqWA
HOUSE-UNDER), there is a tendency for postpositions to attach them-
selves by preference to pronouns and demonstrative stems. Hence the
type noun + postposition is often replaced by its periphrastic equiva-
lent: noun (obj.), pronoun (or demonstrative stem) + postposition;
the noun may follow. An independent objective pronoun may also
be thus periphrastically used with a pronominal or demonstrative
stem.

includes all elements that have been found on analysis. The entries
are made for simple postpositions, compounded forms coining under
the first element; cross references make clear the relationship of the
various elements.
     1. -a-"" PRESENT AT; occurs only as participialized -al l- BEING
PRESENT AT and   compounded: -an u- (cf. 25) PRESENT AT; -an u-yu-
(cf. 25, 49) MOVEMENT FROM; -atuywa- (cf. 30) ALONG TOWARD.
These elements occur only after demonstrative stems, e. g.:
i(y)e'nuan 'am'n'ni     this-at-I do-eontinuative-present, here I am
n(w)a'n oyuntcA pa{i)yü'yu      that (inv.)-at-from-preterit return, (he)

      probably, to local -ma- (7), as indicated by its parallelism to -ywa'ai-
      (11). Objective -ma'q u- is used when coupled with an objective
      noun. Examples are:
      'am a""aic u nana'piya'    it-with-again grew, (he) grew simultaneously
         with it

        For compounded forms, see 7, 8.
         12. -minarjwa- WITH (instrumental); probably compounded with
      -ywa- (8). I t is found only suffixed to objective naywa'q u- BOTH

also 2, 3, 30, 45, 48) occurs almost entirely in composition with pre-
ceding postpositions. I t is not properly a postposition itself, but is
likely to be etymologically identical with the verbal subordinating
-yu- (see § 55,1, c). The translation ACTING that has been given for it
in the preceding entries is only an awkward approximation to its
significance. I t seems to indicate t h a t the action of the verb takes
place under the circumstances indicated in the postpositional phrase,
which may thus be conceived of as subordinately verbified.

  Under this term are included a considerable number of elements
of prevailingly instrumental significance. They are used chiefly
with verb forms, but not exclusively. In nouns they may in part
be employed non-instrumentally, nor is the properly instrumental
function always apparent in verb forms. Their origin is largely ob-
scure, b u t certain analogies suggest strongly t h a t they are on the
whole specialized forms of incorporated nouns with instrumental
function (see § 18, 2, f, a ) ; to some extent they may be related to
verb stems.

    (1) ma-' {man- before tc, ts) HAND. This prefix is clearly related
to, but not directly derived from, independent ma'o-' HAND. I t is
found in one form or other in all Uto-Aztekan dialects (e. g. T ü b a t u -
labal independent ma-; Fernandino, Luisefio -ma; Tarahumare,
Pima ma-; Nahuatl ma- in compounds and as instrumental prefix).
I t is very common as instrumental verb prefix, many verbs not
occurring without it. Its great age is indicated by the presence of
verbs in ma-yw-, spirantized from ma-rn-. Instrumental (in part
apparently objective) examples of verb forms are:man'tcAxqirjqi to crush with one's hand
mayu'x-i}$(£ to point a t
mavi'tsiyi   claps (his) hands
maya 'i* tests by feeling

prefixes (e. g. ma-, ta-°, tsi-°). Its precise force, however, is far
from clear. Perhaps it denotes indefinite instrumentality. In some
cases it seems to refer, like νια-, to the HAND. Examples are:
tcA'pa'niui' shakes (with the hand) (cf. tAKpa'ntu- to shake with the

in a few stereotyped forms:

   see under tea- above)
u^pu'q wi- to bounce (like a ball) (cf. tA'pu'q-wi- to jump).
  This element is not a true instrumental, but rather a stereotyped
objective classifier. I t may, indeed, be used with true instrumental
prefixes, e. g. mao'p-Axqayqi- ΤΟ MAKE A HOLE BY STICKING ONE'S

prefix because it occurs in a number of verbs whose bare stems are
not found in use without it:
patca'qwa-    to get wet, patca'qwi- to be wet
pan'yi-   to wash (trans.), nava'riyi- to wash oneself
patca1qiijwa- to water, irrigate
   Less probably also:
nava'q'i-     to bathe (intrans.) (non-reflexive -paq'i- not found)
   The instrumental prefixes are much more closely connected with
the verb stem proper than any other elements preceding the stem,
e. g. adverbial prefixes, reflexive na- (see § 22, 1), or incorporated
nouns. An instrumental prefix comes nearest the stem. Owing to
this close connection, the psychological analysis becomes somewhat
obscured at times, so that the notion of instrumentality may be
repeated in a preceding incorporated noun, e. g. wii'-ywTpaq m'NA
τ ο RIP OPEN WITH A KNIFE (contains both instrumental incorporated
noun wii- KNIFE and instrumental prefix -tjw'i- < -ινϊ- WITH THE
BLADE OF A LONG OBJECT). Sometimes an instrumental prefix is
so closely identified with the stem that it may be preceded by another
instrumental prefix, e. g. MAlpi'k i- τ ο TOUCH (that ma-' is a prefix
is indicated by parallel tA'pi'ki- τ ο TOUCH WITH THE FOOT) : wima'-

"                        § 48. Plurality of nouns.
   There are two types of noun plurals: the reduplicated form, which
is more properly distributive in function, for both animate and
inanimate nouns (see § 58, 2 for these forms); and properly plural
suffixes, which can, for the most part, be appended only to noun
stems referring to animate beings (cf. the presence of singular and
plural animate forms and the lack of distinctively plural inanimate
forms in the third personal pronouns).
  (1) ANIMATE PLURAL SUFFIXES. Two animate plural suffixes
exist, -ijw'i-' and -mi-', with exactly parallel functions and differ-
entiated merely according to the preceding stem. These elements
apply to duals also, -r/w'i- is evidently spirantized from an older
-mi- (§16, 1); -mi- is the corresponding geminated (and nasalized)
form. Their Uto-Aztekan prototype *-me actually occurs as an
animate plural in Nahuatl {-mi).    In actual practice it seems hardly
                        X Southern Paiute and Ute
214                                 SAPIR
feasible to assign -yw'i- to spirantizing stems alone, -m-'i- definitely
to all geminating (and nasalizing) stems, as their range of usage
seems to intercross with that of types of stem; thus, nominal -tsi-n
(§ 24, 1, f) forms plural -tsiyw'C-, while participial -ti-n (§ 25, 6) forms
-tim 'i-. No simple rules can therefore be given for the use of -yw'i-
or -ιιι ϊ-.
   (a) -mi- (subjective); -m-ϊα- (objective). Examples are:
naya'mi     mountain sheep (sing. na'x A)
qA'qa'rami    quails (sing. qAzqa'w)
tciya'mi   ducks (sing. ici'x-A)
a(i)ya'm'i  turtles (sing. α'ΪΑ)
wTtca'mi    roadrunners (sing. wi't cA)
a'ivam iratjWA our (inclus.) young men (sing. a'i<t>Apits· young man)
yu'tami      Utes (sing, yu-'t-a-ts··, plur. also yu 't a tsajw'i)
   In the last two examples a nominalizing suffix of the singular
(-ρ-'ttsi-, -isi-) has been dropped before the plural suffix. This is not
common; but cf., further, sari't'i'qami         ARAPAHO I N D I A N S (lit.
DOG-EAT-PLURAL, noun-verb compound noun; sing. sari 't Tqats ).
   Animate plural -m 'i- is also appended to cardinal -yu- of numerals
for TWO and above, when used attributively with enclitic -n ta-,
before animate nouns, e. g.:
waa!(i)yumuni    wi'tsi'tsiywiarjA   two-cardinal-animate plur.-like
  great-grandchildren-plural-her (vis.), her two great-grandchildren.
   (b) -ijw'i- (subjective); -Tjwia-, rjwa(·)- (objective). The objective
in -rjwa{·)- is very common; it is merely a phonetic variant of -tjwia-
(see §4, 1, a). Examples of subjective -r/w'i- are:
nava'virjwi    reciprocal-elder brother-plural, two brothers         (sing.
   pavi'm my elder brother)
paa'yw'i aunts; paa'rjwini my aunts (sing, paa'ni my aunt)
qava 'ijw'i horses (sing, qava"")
qarn 'L'ywL jack-rabbits (sing, qa'nii)
tiyiaijWi   deer (sing. tiyi'Ä)
aia't aywi Coconino Indians (sing. aia't-A)
mg 'muiuywi Mormons (sing, my'muni)
  Examples of objective forms are:

    horses

   The use of animate plurals for singulars conceived of as singled out
from a group has been already discussed in connection with participles
in -ti-m 'i- (§ 25, 6, f). This same usage applies to many animate
plurals in -yw'i- as well, e. g.:
pina'p 'äsityw αηΛ smallest-plur. he (vis.), the smallest (boy) of all
rii' avi'mjyimpinarapltsir/WL     I very-least-plur., I (am the) very
    least in size (of my family)

    moving-plur. (obj.), jack-rabbit (obj.) with hair having come off
    from dragging along (referring to one particular animal out of
    several)
   (2) PLURAL -q a-. This suffix has been already discussed as a
verb element defining plurality of the subject (§31, 1, c). I t occurs,
though not frequently, also in the inanimate noun before objective
-ya- (§ 49, 1 ) , postpositive -ma- WITH (§ 50, 4, 9), and possibly other
post-positions to emphasize the plurality (as contrasted with duality)
of an attached enclitic possessive pronoun. I t does not, therefore,
primarily indicate plurality of the noun itself, though this may be
implied. Examples are:tivwL p'iaqa{i)yaTjumi        country-possessive-plural-objective-your
   (plur.), your (plur.) country (obj.) t h a t (you) own
tiya'n'Lmp'iqamami      seed-beater-plural-with-their (vis.), with their
   (plur.) seed-beater(s)                         § 49. Syntactical   cases.
   Paiute recognizes two fundamental syntactical cases, the sub-
jective and objective. The former of these is in use as the subject
of a non-subordinate verb; the object of an imperative (see § 52); and
as a base for the affixing of postpositions (see § 50). The objective is
the case of the object of a transitive verb; the subject of a subordinate
verb (see §55, 1); the genitive (possessive); and the apposition to
a noun with postposition (see §50, 3).
  ( 1 ) FORMATION OF SYNTACTICAL CASES. The subjective case is
simply the absolutive, the unmodified noun with no specific case
                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
216                              SAPIRsuffix. The objective is formed by suffixing -a- to the final vowel
of the noun, if this vowel is i, I, a, or u (o); -ya- (-ία-) if the final
vowel is a. Examples are:
         SUBJECTIVE                           OBJECTIVE
sari'is- dog ( < -iSL-)               sari 'tsi' (< -tsia-)
ayqa'qwicaRi    lightning             atjqa' qwicanA
U'qwi'yu' arrow ( < u'qwt'yw-)        vxqwi yuu (< u'qwi'yva-)
qanini my house                       qani'ani
qam'ayA his (vis.) house              qani'aijA
quna'vi'imi thy sack                  quna'via'ami
ραΛ water                             paa'tA
paa'rami our (2 inclus.) aunt         paa'iarami
nampa 'yA his (vis.) leg (stem        nampa'ia-ηΑ
  nampa-)
   Another objective suffix, -q u-, -yqu-, is used after numeral stems
(see § 59, 2, a) and after certain postpositions (e. g. -ma-, -ψοα- ON;
-rjwa'ai- TOGETHER WITH; -mpa-AT; -upa- THROUGH; see § 5 0 , 4 ) ;
cf. also adverbial ü ijqu- (§ 30, 2, b).
  (2) U S E OF SYNTACTICAL CASES. The subjective as a subject and
the objective as a transitive object are so plentifully illustrated in
the course of this paper that no further examples need be given here.
The other uses of the subjective will be illustrated below (§ 52; §
50), also the use of the object as the subject of a subordinate verb
(§55, 1).
  The genitive function of the objective is seen, e. g., in:
ftv^i'pT qiip»a 'ava'LnfC land (obj.) edge-at-participle (obj.), being
   (obj.) at (the) edge of (the) land
•Hwa'ri' tu(w)a'tsii)wi rain (obj.) children, Rain's children
  Often with pleonastic use of a pronominal enclitic, e. g.:
cina'ywavL %ntu' q-urjWA coyote (obj.) back-flesh-his (inv.), Coyote's
   back flesh
qam""aijw u'u'rn paa'(i)ya<t>i (he went) house-obj.-her it-toward
   aunt-obj.-own, (he went) toward his aunt's house
   While the subjective form is used as a base for the suffixing of a
postposition, the form is felt as the equivalent of an objective, as
appositions to such nouns or pronouns are regularly put in the objec-
tive, e. g. wantsi αϊ] αψι'ητα ANTELOPE (OBJ.) HE (VIS.; = HIM) HE-

tremely common (see § 50, 3).
   The sporadic subjective use of objective forms of independent
personal pronouns in certain not clearly understood cases has been
already mentioned (§ 39, 4, end).","[231, 232, 233, 234, 235]"
"   (1) COMPOUND N O U N S . Compound nouns are most easily classified
with reference to the nature of the first and second compounded terms.
Triple and quadruple compounds are always morphologically binary,
one or both of the terms being in turn compound. Thus, the examples
given above are to be analyzed as HORSE-TAIL + HAIR and BLOOD-
ROAST + ASK FOR. Nouns stems, particularly in initial position,
sometimes appear in abbreviated form; e. g. rii-n PERSON < ηϊψνϊ-',
na-n TRAIL < naywa-', pa-' WATER < pa·-*. For mo'o-' HAND is
sometimes usedTOO-»(cf. verb prefix ma-', § 20, 2). The qualifying
element regularly precedes. Noun compounds whose second ele-
ment is a participle or adjective, though logically substantival, are
morphologically best interpreted as either verbs (adjectives) with
incorporated noun subject or object (see 2, f below) or, more fre-
quently, participial derivatives of such verbs (adjectives).

compound nouns are morphologically active or passive participles

They function as true nouns nevertheless. Indeed, to only a slight
extent can the verbs be freely used with the incorporated noun sub-
jects, while participial derivatives of such verbs are very frequent.

on a considerably specialized meaning, notably qari'-Ri SITTING

  Rather different from these examples in inner, if not outer, form
are compounds in which the participle is freely used in a substantival

                                              ""stream with sandy bed,"" not

   Very common are noun + participle compounds in which the noun
is to be thought of as the object of the verb back of the participle.
Here again the compound is functionally a noun, the logical emphasis
being generally placed on the first element. Examples are:to'o'ivi- bulrush + ora-n ani        my     to'o'ivioran an UR my-bulrush-

qaru- house + itü-mp'i-     old        qam'itümp'i      house-old, old
                                          house
vA'a-"" penis + pi'to'p i- is- short    wi'a'pi'topits· penis-short, short

  (d) Noun + verb compounds. Nouns which are compounded of
a noun stem and a bare verb (or adjective-verb) stem are extremely
uncommon. They seem to belong to the ""bahuvrihi"" type. Examples
are:
wi'a-"" penis + NOxqo""mi to bend        m'a'n'N0zq""0'Mi       penis-bend,
   (intr.)                               bent-penised (personal name)

   (ordinarily toca-)                     River
   (e) Verb + noun compounds.         These are fairly frequent, e. g.:

                                         pack-dog

  Here must be included compounds of adjective-verb stems and
noun stems, which also are quite common, particularly in a ""bahu-
vrihi"" sense (sometimes nominalized by -tsi-, § 24, 1, f) and in verbal
derivatives in -leai- το HAVE (§ 26, 1, b). Examples are:

based on verbs compounded of verb (or adjective) + verb, e. g.
ar/qa'qwfcaM BED-FLASHING, LIGHTNING; and nouns compounded
of verb (or adjective) stems and participles that have substantival
force to begin with, e. g. ai)qa'paNUxqwint'i RED-STREAM (pa'NU x -
qwi-nt'i WATER-FLOWING, STREAM).   (f) Participle + noun compounds.         This type of noun compound
is not uncommon. Examples are:

                                            very good song
  The noun of the compound may, of course, itself be participial in
form, e. g. to'qwan-nu'qwint'i BEING BLACK-STREAMING, BLACK
STREAM.   (g) Adjective + noun compounds. Aside from adjective-verb stems
and adjective-verb participles, true adjectives may also be used as
the first, qualifying, elements of noun compounds, some of them
(e. g. αϊ-' NEW and i -s OLD) being apparently found only in such com-
pounds. Examples are:
mui''-ρ ϊ-' little (absolute nua''p-ϊ-   mia""p im 'onts· little hand; mia""-

   Some adjectives may precede the nouns they qualify as independent
terms, e. g. also mi.a""pi-is· qa'ni LITTLE HOUSE.
  (h) Numeral + noun compounds.       These are very common and
comprise one of the typical methods of expressing numeral relations.
For examples see § 59, 2, b.
   (i) Pronoun + noun compounds.  These are quite rare, including
terms compounded with interrogative ini-' WHAT KIND OF, WHICH
and qima-' OTHER, which has certain pronominal peculiarities (see
§ 39, 2). Examples are:
in i-' what + fiyiv'i-      friend      'ini'ntciyivini     what friend of
                                           mine?
qima-' other + qani- house              qima'xanini       my other house
      qima- may also qualify as an independent pronoun, e. g. qima'ric u
qani'ni       MY OTHER HOUSE.      (j) Adverb + noun compounds.     These also are rare.     An example
is:
tanU'vwai-       far west               tanfi'vwaiuvwia<£i far-west songs,
                                          songs borrowed from western
                                           tribes
   (2) COMPOUND VERBS. Verbs compounded with other independent
stems, particularly verbs and nouns, are extremely common in Paiute.
Under compound verbs are, of course, to be included adjective-verbs
and participles.
    (a) Verb + verb compounds.     A great many verb stems may be
used as the second elements of compound verbs. As to their morpho-
logical force, they seem to fall into two groups, those whose action
is to be thought of as contemporaneous or coordinate with that of the
first verb stem (here belong particularly verbs of position and move-
ment) and those upon which the first verb stem logically depends
as a kind of object (e. g. τ ο WRITE-PRACTICE, TO PRACTICE WRITING).
                           X Southern Paiute and Ute
80                                  SAPIH
It is not easy to draw a sharp line between the two groups. Not a
few verb stems are used chiefly, if not entirely, as second elements of
compounds. Some have become specialized in a quasi-formal
significance (e. g. -paiy'i- το RETURN, also το HAVE JUST DONE SO
AND so).
   Among the former group are: -aid- το LIE (sing.); -m ia- SEVERAL GO,
T R A V E L , GO IN ORDER ΤΟ; -nuqwi- ΤΟ RUN, START OFF;       -nu'i-kai-
SEVERAL STAND; -pay(a)i- το W A L K , in compounds generally WHILE
ON ONE'S W A Y ; -pa(i)yi- ΤΟ RETURN, BACK;- pan-ay a- SEVERAL RETURN;
-pitci- ΤΟ ARRIVE; -pini- ΤΟ SEE, LOOK; -puru- ΤΟ GO ABOUT, FROM
PLACE TO PLACE (cf. independent poro- SEVERAL J O U R N E Y ) ; -qa- το
SING; -qari- το SIT (sing.); -qwavi- SEVERAL LIE; -kmpa-        το HIT;
-waywi SEVERAL STAND; -w'in'i- το STAND (sing.); -yuywi- SEVERAL
SIT. Examples are:-avi-     to lie                        ψιι'ανιχα'     while thus-do-lying,

   Such a second verb-stem needs only to drop out of independent
usage to take on the appearance of a suffix. This step has undoubt-
edly been taken more than once (see § 28).
   Under the rubric of verb + verb compounds are to be included
also compounds of adjective-verb stem and verb stem and of adjective-
verb stem and adjective-verb stem. Examples of the former are:
pdi-""     to be smooth                  pa 'ntA'ciu'kvdrjqi to slip on some-
                                           thing smooth

verb + adjective-verb (or adjective-verb participle) are:to·-"" to be black + -m'unuq wa -        to'm'unuqwap'iyaini           became

(not merely adjective-verb stems), including participles, and verbs
(or participles) are quite uncommon, except for compounds whose
first element is 'a't iGOOD, e. g.            ""'a'ttmpu'tcu'tcuywaplya'aikwA

GOOD SHOUTER.      I t is remarkable t h a t in most of these examples
""'a't-i-"" and the following verb are treated as accentually distinct,
i. e. the law of alternating stresses is broken. The doublets -τιαη-
qa'p'iya'aikwA    and -ncCtjqApiya'aikwA shows the struggle between
the force of analogy of the simplex and the regular operation of the
phonetic law.   (c) Pronoun + verb compounds.    Independent personal pronouns
are not compounded with verbs. Under this heading, however, are
included verbs compounded with quasi-pronominal qima- OTHER
(see § 39, 2) and verbs compounded of independent personal pronoun
+ -nc u'ai-n a 'ai- τ ο PAY NO ATTENTION TO. Examples are:qima-   other                           qim a'ntcikwa-rywa'* shall not be
                                           mixed up with others
-nc u'ai-n a 'ai- to pay no atten-      niru'c u'ain a·'"" pay no attention

                                           attention to him  The latter examples are just as readily explainable as verbalized
pronoun + postposition (see § 50, 4, 29).

An example of a verb compounded with naijwa""""qu-n BOTH (objec-
tive in form) is naT)wa""""q umpAxqayu ΤΟ KILL BOTH (i. e. to guess
correctly both bone-positions in hand game).
   (e) Adverb + verb compounds. T h e adverbs here referred to m a y
occur also independently. There is no real line of demarcation
between them and specialized adverbial prefixes (§ 20). Examples
are:
nava'cu-      in vain                     nam'cup-A'qayu        to kill in vain
                                              (note accentual irregularity,
                                              cf. b above).

   (f) Noun + verb compounds.       These comprise examples of w h a t
is ordinarily known as noun incorporation. T h e absolutive or
classificatory suffix of the noun is frequently lost in noun-verb com-
pounds. The syntactic relation implied between the verb and its
incorporated noun may be of various sorts. T h e incorporated noun
may be an instrument; it may indicate similarity; it m a y function
as a direct object; it may have local significance; it may function
as the subject of the verb; it may be a predicate of the subject; or it
may be a predicate of the object. Any of these relations may be,
and more often is, expressed by properly syntactic or morphological
processes. I t is not possible to give a simple rule as to when noun
incorporation is possible or required, whether, e. g., to say Ι TRAIL-
SEEK or Ι SEEK A TRAIL. There is a good deal of option in this matter,
but m a n y cases of incorporation are fixed by idiomatic usage. There
is some tendency to express what might be called characteristic or
generalized relations by syntactic means. Any general and valid
rule, however, is hardly to be formulated.     (o) An instrumental     function is illustrated in:

   The verb ya'ai- το DIE is idiomatically used with incorporated
nouns of instrumental function to express various unpleasant psychic
states, e. g. tu'qwt'-y'ai- το B E ASHAMED; ηαηα'-ί'αί- το ANGER-DIE,
TO B E ANGRY; ttyi'(i)-ya'ai- ΤΟ HUNGER-DIE, TO B E HUNGRY.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"
"    ( 3 ) ASSIBILATION OF DENTALS. N O dental consonant, aside from
n, i. e. t and its derivatives t\ r, r, is, with very few exceptions, found
before i. Comparison with other Shoshonean or Uto-Aztekan
dialects shows t h a t an original Shoshonean ti became assibilated to
tsi, e. g. noun ending -tsi-: Tübatulabal and Southern Californian -t.
Further, comparison shows that an original Shoshonean ati not only,
in Southern Paiute, assibilates the t but also shifts the i to ϊ, whence
atci. Most Plateau dialects have ati in these cases, e. g.:
Shoshonean *ati bow                    S.P. atci-
  > Bankalachi a li-t,
  Shikaviyam t'di,
  Mono tli
Shoshonean *paii daughter              S.P. patci- (original Shoshonean
  > N. Paiute padi                       *pati would have become *ραή-)
   Hence S. Paiute atsi represents an old Shoshonean atsi with primary
is; e. g. contrast primary patsi- OLDER SISTER (cf. Cora hatsi OLDER
BROTHER; Cora h often < p) with patci- < *pati DAUGHTER.
   There are a small number of cases of true -ri- (not -ri- < - n - ;
§ 3, 2, b), b u t these m a y well represent a group of loan-words taken
in subsequently to the operation of the above law, e. g. mori - BEAN;
sari - DOG; qiri'n'nayqa- SPARROW-HAWK.
   Belonging to a distinct and probably more recent stratum than
the primary U, tc and the ts, tc developed from t before original i

ordinarily be spirantized to r (see § 16, 1), stands after an i. In this
stratum, which constitutes a living process, t- and -r-, -tc- constantly
interchange. Examples are:
-ri- participle (§ 25, 6, a)            ivi-tci- drinking
-TU- to make (§ 26, 1, d)               rui-ya 'tci-tcu- to turn oneself into

   When i is preceded by a nasal consonant, the -t-, -r- develops to
-ntc- (see § 16, 3), e. g. qani-wtcu'a- H O U S E ?
   Geminated -ί-, it should be carefully noted, does not assibilate to
-tc- after i, but remains, e.g. tümpwi'-t-u- ΤΟ MAKE A S T O N E ; na'a'i-
tu'p""ikuqwa'      HAS B U R N T UP.
   Nasalized -nt- also is regularly unaffected by a preceding i; e. g.
ovwi'nto'tsi$a' WOODEN-HEADED, ovwi'ntuv'°a n-i W I L L MAKE WOOD,
ovi'ntu'arjuntca-rjA H E BECAME A STICK. There is, however, a ten-
dency for such cases of -nt- to become assibilated to -ntc-; e. g.
o{w)i'pintcu- to make a canyon ( < oi'pi-"", see § 16, 3). In such
cases the theoretical -nt- is sometimes even replaced by the ""spirantal""
form -tc-; e. g. ovi'tcuqwA UNDER T H E STICK (but also ovi'ntuq-WA).
   After ai- το SAY, -1-, -r- develops to -nie-, not -tc-, e. g. ai-ntci-
SAYING. On the other hand, usitative -mi- (§ 30, 10) changes a follow-
ing -<-, -r- to -nt-, not -ntc-, e. g. ai-rni-nti- B E I N G WONT TO S A Y ; cf. - 7 0 -
nfi- HAVING < -yai- ΤΟ HAVE (§ 25, 6, a), -q a-nfi- HAVING - E D < per-
fective -q ai- (§ 25, 6, d). There are historical antecedents involved
here which can be unraveled only by comparative evidence.
   (4) PALATALIZATION. An i palatalizes a following k- sound, less
frequently a dental or back-palatal nasal (n, y). Acoustically this
is manifested as a y- like affection of the consonant. I t is indicated,
in the case of back-palatals, by the symbol for anterior articulation
(e. g. k, sounding approximately like ky); by a superior "" in the
case of n.
   The ny (approximately like Russian ""soft"" or mouille n) appears
most often between two i- vowels, particularly when the second is
unvoiced, e. g. maa'in-H- το TOUCH, maa'in""i*kant'i HAVING TOUCHED.
   The palatalized η (approximately like French gn, possibly more
posterior in articulation) is not very common, as the combination
-irj- occurs only infrequently, e. g. iya- H E H E R E .
   The palatalized k- sounds are k < k, q; k- (written k?) < k\
     7ι X < γ, χ; χ < x; yw, χυ) < yw, χιν. χ is practically identical
with ch of German ich. y is very close to y, but more spirantal in
quality (less open or vocalic), possibly a shade less anterior in articu-

52                                   SAPIRlation; it was practically never misheard as y. % is midway, in
point of voicing, between y (of which it is merely a variant) and x.
   Examples of palatalized k- sounds are:-yai-, -χαϊ- subordinating suffix        avi'xa lying; a'iyaicu        as soon
                                            as (he) said

-i of the preceding word; e. g. uvwa'i)Wi kanintcuqwaina<£i THEREIN
HIS-OWN-MADE-HOUSE.","[68, 69, 70]"
"  (5) TREATMENT OF y. The back-guttural y is apt to undergo
various modifications, aside from unvoicing (§ 8), palatalization (4
above), and labialization (§ 14, 3, c).   (a) Stopping to g. In poetry y is not infrequently stopped to
g (the sonant correspondent of q). In prose this occurs when a final
-y of the preceding word comes, by elision of an initial vowel (see §
10, 3, end), to stand immediately before the -γ-, e. g. a'ia-η ϊγϊκTHAT-HE INDEED >     a'ia-η gin.
   (b) Weakening or loss of y. An original y is sometimes weakened
to a glide y or even entirely lost before or after an u- vowel, more
often after an ϊ- vowel. Vocalic contractions may then result (see
§ 4). Examples are:
na-^u'q wi-yqi- to fight (lit., to       ncFu'q wnjqi-, na'uq wii]qi-
   shoot at each other < quq wi-
   to shoot)
yauywi- to enter                         ya-uywi-
fiyia- deer (-γ- may be glide,           Xi 'iamqua^i    deer-meat

              SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                      53   (c) Unvoicing to χ in voiced position. Even before a voiced vowel
y is sometimes heard not merely as an intermediate χ , with which
it varies frequently, but as a fully unvoiced χ (or lengthened i );
similarly y > x. This sharpening seems to be frequent after an
accented a, particularly in the neighborhood of a glottal stop, e. g.:
-ayava- yu- right among                  a a'xavaiyu     right in there
-yi- to come in order to                 yu'(v>)a!xtyami      come to take

iya'vaya-     to fear                    iya'vaxan'nami     whom you feared
   (6) VOCALIZATION OF SEMIVOWELS. T h e semivowels y and w
are sometimes opened up to the corresponding vowels i and u {o).
Forms with glide -i- (§5, 1) are transitional; e. g. -aya- > -a(i)ya- >
-aia-. Examples of -y- > -i- are:
nampa'-ya rjA his foot (obj.)            ηαηνρα'ία ηΛ
narja- anger + y(a)'ai- to die of         naija'i'ai-
  > naya'y'ai- to be angry
  After an i, the i < y apparently disappears as such, fusing with
the preceding vowel, e. g.:
tuqwi-    shame + y(a)'ai-               tu'qwi'ai-    to be ashamed
tsi- with the point + yauywL-
   tca- to cause several objects to      1sia-'u*>witcAp'iya' caused (them)

                                           point (§ § 4, 1, a; 13, 5, b)
  A w immediately following a back-palatal stop or i) is sometimes

54                                        SAPIR   ( 7 ) SIMPLIFICATION OF CONSONANTS.     Here are grouped together
a number of consonantal simplifications or partial losses of charac-
teristic quality, found chiefly in sentence phonetics.
   (a) Simplification of affricatives. A final -ts- ( < -tri-) or, less
often, -tc'f is sometimes reduced to -<·, -<·' before a word beginning
with a dental (f, n), less frequently before a word beginning with a
labial, e. g.:
""Uni'rjuts· then                             %ni'rjut- nontsi'k-up'iya' then flew
                                                 off; iini'ijut·' maya'iacu   then

                                                 (< i'tcf tTqa 'q-A)
     An internal -ist- is sometimes reduced to -t ri-, -tn- before η (see §
3, 2 , C ) :wiHsi't smi my great-grandchild                wi'Uit-v,(n)l
na' a'ints tsmiA like a girl                 na'a'ints tnniA
     (b) Assimilation      of -R to n-.     This happens only rarely, e. g.:
yu'un αΒ.(ϊ)          my leg                  yu'un an nantsi'n'aijqix i    come
                                                and joint my leg
   (c) Loss of labialization. Before an u or ο of the following word
a final -qw-, -yw-, -yw- is apt to lose its w (cf. simplification of wo < wa
after back-palatal stops to a; § 3,1, c). Examples are:
-raijw(a-) we                                'ivw'i'rat) iiru'yuts· let us then
-qw(a-)    it                                aija""q• uvmai' who is it then?
pina'Tjqw(a-) soon                           pina'r/q V "" soon so
   Final -x w sometimes melts with following qw- to -q-w- (cf. § 8, 1,
g), e. g.:
i{y)t't-ux-WA qwau* hither off               i(y)it-uq   wau'
  ( 8 ) ASSIMILATION OF SIBILANTS.      When two successive syllables
contain sibilants of different articulation (s, ts: c, tc; see § 12, 2, h),

             SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                            55assimilation generally results either to the s- or c- position.              The
following types of sibilant assimilation have been observed.
  (a) Assimilation of s—c to s—-s. This seems to be rare. An
example is Asi'-saywa- LIGHT BLUE (contrast -ica- of qwica- τ ο
SPAHK).  (b) Assimilation of s—tc to c—tc. This also is not common. A
good example is cdcu- NAIL < sitcu- < *situ- (cf. Kawaiisu -cito-).
   (c) Assimilation     of ts—c to tc—c or ts—s.      Generally ts—s appears,
e. g.:
-tsi-c u-,-ts -cu-    (§ 35; § 19, 2, k)   -tsis u-, -tssu-:   pika'xit-
                                              navitsiS-uat)A only his little

                                              only my son
-tsi(-ts)-campa-     (§ 19, 2, j)          tiv^i'ts sampA    truly
   Yet tc—c also seems to occur, e. g. sari'tcicum            ONLY MY DOG       <
sari'tsi-cu-.
   (d) Assimilation of tc—s to tc—c. This uncommon type is il-
lustrated, e. g., in tca 'c L%ani MENSTRUAL HUT (for more normal
-as-1- contrast as ia - SURFACE).
  (e) Assimilation of ts—tc to tc—tc (ts—ts).      The normal tc—tc
assimilation, which occurs very frequently, is illustrated in:
-tsi- noun suffix + -tcu'a- inter-         a'ipatcitcu'""    a boy?
   rogative
-tsi- + -tcu- to make                      naya-'tcitcuqwayumpa,'     will turn
                                              (them)selves into rats
-tsi- + -ica- preterital enclitic          mama"" utcdcarjA        woman did—
                                             him
-tsi- diminutive + -tci- participle        avi'tcitciA little lying (obj.), little
                                             ridge
  T h e less frequent assimilation to ts—ts is probably regular when
the primary ts is initial, e. g. ts -tsa'yki'a- ΤΟ CARRY ON A POLE (tsi-
WITH THE POINT, § 21, 9). Moreover, subordinating -tsi- (§ 55, 1, a),
unlike diminutive -tsi- or nominal -tsi- (cf. above examples), seems
regularly to maintain itself and to assimilate following tc to ts, e. g.:
ψιι'-tsi- having so done, then +           ifni'tsitsayWA   then we
   -tcar/wa- we

rather scanty. An example is mini's-'its-          S E V E R A L HAVING R E T U R N E D<                  m'ini'c-'i-.
    (g) Unassimilated             forms.       The frequent sequence tc—ts              seems
normally to remain unaffected, e. g. qa'ivavdcdsvrjw'i                         KAIBAB PAIUTES
(lit., M O U N T A I N - L Y I N G P E O P L E , P L A T E A U P E O P L E ) . When the ts is
final, however, assimilated tc—tc                   seems to be not uncommon, e. g.
