"                                   15.8.3.1. HuchnomLamb (1955:31) records several Huchnom content questions and their responses. The
questions begin with a question word, as in Yuki. The verbs in these questions appear
to be affixed with -ˀą, which may possibly be cognate with the Yuki interrogative -ha.
   Compare the question in (54a) with its answer in (54b). Note the presence of -ˀą at
the end of the verb hayima:ˀą ‘doing’ in the question in (54a), and its absence on the
same verb in (54b).(54a) Lamb 1955: 31, LJ

In this example, the sun has been stolen and when the individuals searching for the sun
ask Coyote if he has seen it, he does not introduce his response with ˀąhąˀ ‘yes’ or tąlk
‘no’. Instead in (44), Coyote responds with a conjecture about the location of the sun.

never follows finite =mil, but instead replaces it in polar questions. Note the loss of
glottalization in past habitual -mil’ in (65).

specific time. Kroeber (1911:362) describes declarative =k as “generally translatable by
the present tense of English. It may imply continuance. It makes verbs of adjectival
stems.” Schlichter (1985:64) reconstructs *-k or *-ki as the declarative endings for
adjectives and *-ik or *-iki as the declarative endings for verbs.

    With the exception of the roots in šót̯hmol ‘oriole’ and moymeˑmol’ ‘pencil’, the verb roots that are being
nominalized here are also found in Yuki, as can be seen in these roots taken from Sawyer and Schlichter
1984: woy- ‘smoke’, ˀąy- ‘glide’ (ˀuk’ ‘water’), pąk- ‘cover’ (nan ‘head’), hąwąy- ‘food/eat’, šuˀ- ‘sit’. In the
case of moymeˑmol’ ‘pencil’, as can be seen in (191), Lamb glosses this word also as ‘something to write
with’ therefore implying that the root is a verb meaning ‘write’.

and Huchnom. Therefore little can be said about the specific structure or nature of
Coast Yuki verb morphology except that at a glance it seems similar to that of Yuki and
Huchnom.
   As can be seen in the examples below, there appear to be some endings recognizable
from Yuki, such as a possible declarative ending -kʻ in (194), an imperative perhaps
ending in a final glottal stop or a glottal stop followed by a vowel in (196) and (197), a
question suffix that also appears to include a vowel and a glottal stop in (199), and an
agentive/instrumental ending that appears similar to that seen in Yuki and Huchnom
in (200) and (201). At the same time, as can be seen in (198), apparently some
imperatives also end in -kʻ, which is different from what is known in Yuki and
Huchnom.  (193) - (174) show examples of Coast Yuki declarative clauses.","[337, 338]"
"                                            7.1. OverviewYuki verbs are root-initial and, with the exception of the body prefixes discussed in
§2.2.1.1 and §7.3.2, all inflectional and derivational verb morphology takes the form of
suffixes or enclitics. The boundaries between morphemes in the verb are generally
fairly clear phonologically, though some assimilation and allomorphy is present157.
   Verbs are suffixed with a rich collection of morphology indicating tense, aspect,
mood, transitivity, negation, questions, evidentiality, and dependent clauses. The Yuki
verb has a templatic structure: suffixes are attached to the root in a particular order
relative to each other. Yuki shows no argument marking on the verb itself158. Instead,
arguments are referenced using switch-reference markers159 and/or with actual noun
or pronoun arguments.
                                   7.2. Verb TemplateThe Yuki verb template is shown in Table 17. The template shows the order that verb
morphology takes within a verb. All verb morphology, except for the body prefixes,
follows the verb root and takes the form of either suffixes or enclitics. No verbs exist
with all positions filled on the template. Most verbs have only a few slots filled on the
template. Within serial verb constructions160, verbs can occur as bare roots without any
additional verb morphology.",[247]
"                                     2.1.1.6. GeminationThere are no phonemic geminate consonants in Yuki. However, sequences of two
identical consonants can result in phonetic geminates. These are found from time to
time at morpheme boundaries, as a result of the coda consonant of one morpheme
being the same as the onset of the subsequent morpheme49. Only one instance of this
type of phonetic geminate is found in the Logan recording. As shown in (2), a phonetic
geminate /m/ occurs in kómmuṭ ‘came’ when -mą, a verbal suffix indicating movement,
is suffixed onto the verb root kom- ‘come.’(2)    káṭa ˀąp          kómmuṭ

 Geminates can also occur as a result of assimilation. See §2.1.1.8.7.

 Question marks indicate glosses and morphemic analyses with uncertain or not completely settled
meanings.

Syllable-final consonant clusters may be composed of a sequence of a sibilant and a
stop, a nasal and an obstruent, or a liquid and an obstruent. Glottalized sonorants can
also occur in these clusters. Examples of syllable-final clusters are shown in (3).(3)     musp ‘woman’ AA, MF                        p’ans ‘wind’ AA, MF

predicate nominal, predicate adjective, predicate oblique, question, imperative, and
negative clauses. Dependent clauses, including adverbial and relative clauses, and
complement clauses are also described.
   There exist few earlier descriptions of Yuki syntax. Kroeber (1911:372) presents a
summary of his observations pertaining to syntax and word order. He also presents a
short text in Yuki with his observations of the function and meaning of individual
words, along with these other comments on Yuki syntax. The other main study
pertaining to Yuki syntax is presented by Mithun (2008), who describes Yuki argument
structure.","[419, 420, 421]"

    There may be a special relationship between –am and –paˀ that remains to be understood. In polar
questions the future tense –paˀ takes on the form –paˀam.
180
    In CW:53, the verb páˀiyimímil ‘raised’ occurs. –mí- may be the imperfective or it may possibly be a
misheard form of –mil-, which, according to the analysis of this grammar, can either be directional –mą
followed by mediopassive –il or, alternatively, a morpheme with an unknown meaning –mil.

    Throughout the texts Kroeber occasionally gives alternate forms for certain words. No explanation is
given in the texts or accompanying notes detailing the origin of these forms.

       ‘“You a re doing badly”, said Lizard to Coyote.’   Kroeber (1911) describes the suffixes shown in Table 20 as unique morphemes, but
for the reasons stated above these instead can be analyzed as imperfective -(a)m or in
the case of -mik, discussed below, -(a)m followed by declarative =k. Imperfective -(a)m
followed by declarative =k can also be pronounced [aŋk], as shown above in (46b).","[273, 274, 275]"
"      The Yuki system of counting - and it alone among the Yukian languages - is
      not decimal or quinary, but octonary. Only the Salinan and Chumash, far to
      the south, follow an analogous quaternary method. It is remarkable that the
      Yuki counted on their fingers as regularly as any other people in the State.
      The explanation is that they did not count the fingers but the spaces between
      them, in each of which, when the manipulation was possible, two twigs were
      laid. Naturally enough their “hundred” was 64.
         The younger men, who have associated with the Americans, seem not to
      realize that their fathers thought by eights instead of tens, and are so
      confused in consequence that they give the most contradictory accounts of
      even the lowest native numerals. The old generation, on the other hand, is
      as innocent of our method. One of these survivors, when asked if he knew
      how many fingers he had, answered without hesitation, huchamopesul, ten.
      Asked how many finger and toes he had, he replied he did not know. If the
      query had been how many spaces there were between his fingers and toes,
      which would trip up many a civilized person required to answer without
      calculation or actual count, he would no doubt have known instantly. Two
      pairs of hands were then spread before him as the accepted equivalent of his
      own fingers and toes, and he began a laborious count, pushing the digits
      together into groups of fours. The result he announced was molmihuipoi,
      nineteen. Unaccustomed to handling fingers, he had overlooked a thumb.
      When the same man was allowed to place pairs of little sticks between his
      own fingers, as was habitual to him, he reckoned rapidly and correctly.
         The Yuki managed their count with only three real numeral words: panwi,
      one; opi, two; molmi, three. Every other word denoting numbers up into the
      hundreds is a description of the process of counting. Thus, a translation of
      their numerals four to twenty runs as follows: two-forks, middle-in, even-
      chilki, even-in, one-flat, beyond-one-hang, beyond-two-body, three-body,
      two-forks-body, middle-in-body, even-chilki-body, even-in-body, middle-

        forks-middle-project. Sixty-four is two-fork-pile-at. There are sometimes
        several ways of denoting a number. Thus eight is one-flat, or hand-two-only
        (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:176-177).","[360, 361]"
"                             2.1.1.4.2. Post-Velar /k/ and /k’/The place of articulation of /k/ and /k’/ is post-velar. Yuki /k/ and /k’/ are pronounced
further back than English /k/, but not so far back as to be considered uvular. The post-
velar place of articulation for /k/ and /k’/ is not limited to the speech of Frank Logan,
as Kroeber (1911:348), who worked with Yuki speaker Ralph Moore, also makes this
observation stating that: “post-palatals…[are] apparently formed somewhat farther
back in the mouth than the ordinary English k sounds.”                                      2.1.1.4.3. /š/ and /č//š/, /č/, and /č’/ are classified as palato-alveolar consonants44. In Logan’s
pronunciation the place of articulation of these sounds is close to that of /ṭ/45.                                     2.1.1.4.4. /s’/ and /w’/Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:10) include /s’/ as a possible phoneme and /w’/ as a
phoneme in the inventory of Yuki consonant phonemes. Neither of these consonants is
present in any Yuki word with the glottalized or pre-glottalized pronunciation that one
44
   Langdon and Silver (1984:151) recognize Yuki as having a dental stop /t̯/, an alveolar or postalveolar
stop /ṭ/, and a postalveolar or retroflex fricative /ʂ/, but not a postalveolar or retroflex affricate /tʂ/.
45
   The postalveolar or retroflex quality in the pronunciation of /š/ was also noted by Kroeber, who would
transcribe some instances of /š/ as <ṣ>, as in: hą́:ʂimil ‘(Taykómol) told him to build’ (RM).
                                        Phonetics and Phonology                                     43would expect in a Yuki glottalized consonant. Instead Schlichter’s claim for the
existence of these two phonemes, though never explicitly stated, appears to be drawn
from a comparison with forms present in Huchnom and Coast Yuki and a deeper
historic and morphophonemic analysis of morpheme-final glottalized consonants.
   The existence of /s’/ and /w’/ in Yuki can be extrapolated from the process
described in §2.1.1.8.8.1. As a result of this process the glottalization of morpheme-final
glottalized stops and affricates is not pronounced on the stop or affricate, but instead
spreads to the preceding vowel where the it is pronounced as a VʔV sequence. The
examples discussed below are taken from Schlichter’s reconstruction of Proto-
Northern Yukian (PNY)46.
   The second person plural agent pronoun is recorded as moˀos (AA, MF) or mos (AA)47.
Schlichter (1985:21) reconstructs this pronoun as Proto-Northern Yukian (PNY) *miˀ ~
*moˀ ‘second person’48 affixed with PNY plural *-s. The result is a final [ˀs] sequence with
the glottalization following the pattern observed for morpheme-final glottalized
consonants. Instead of being pronounced as a glottalized consonant, the glottalization
spreads to the preceding vowel and is manifested as a VʔV sequence. Thus: PNY: *moˀ +
*-s = Yuki: *moˀs > moˀos.
   Similarly for naw ‘bee, yellowjacket,’ alternate forms recorded for this word in Yuki
and cognate forms recorded in Huchnom and Coast Yuki show the same VʔV sequence
seen in other types of morpheme-final glottalized consonants. This is seen in Huchnom
naˀa:w, naw ‘honeybee’ and Coast Yuki nά’ ‘αw ‘yellowjacket’ and earlier Yuki forms, such
as na’ǝ̨m ‘yellowjacket’ recorded from Minnie Fulwider by Sydney Lamb (Schlichter
1985:378).
   /w’/ never appears as [ˀw] or [w’] in a surface form of ‘bee, honeybee, yellowjacket’
in Yuki itself, though the pattern is suggestive of its existence underlyingly. /w’/ does46
   In her reconstruction, Schlichter refers to the reconstructed ancestor of Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast
Yuki as Proto-Yukian. In this work the proto-language of these three languages is referred to as Proto-
Northern Yukian to avoid confusion with the ancestor language shared by the three Northern Yukian
languages and Wappo.
47
   In Coast Yuki the pre-glottalization of final /s/ is preserved: mô’s̥ ‘ye’ (Schlichter 1985:381).
48
    Schlichter’s reconstruction of PNY second-person pronouns is supported by the fact that these
pronouns were probably borrowed from the Pomoan languages. Yuki miˀ ‘2SG.AGT’ and mos ~ moˀos
‘2PL.AGT’ correspond well to Eastern Pomo mí ‘2SG.OBL’ and má ‘2PL.NOM/ACC’ (Sawyer and Schlichter
1984:244, McLendon 1975:107). One can imagine speakers of Proto-Northern Yukian (PNY) suffixing the
Pomoan second person plural pronoun with PNY plural *-s in order to emphasize the plural nature of
that pronoun or to match an existing paradigm.
44                         University of California Publications in Linguisticsappear in surface forms in Huchnom hewˀ ‘yes’ and Coast Yuki héw’ ‘yes’, but not in Yuki
hąwhaˀ ‘yes’ (AA).
   A phonemic glottalized form /y’/ exists for the other Yuki glide /y/, thus the
existence of phonemic /w’/ in Yuki would not be unexpected. In addition, /w’/ also
exists in Wappo (Thompson et al. 2006:3), therefore there is a precedent for this
phoneme in Yukian. Phonemic /s’/ on the other hand is extremely rare typologically
and occurs only phonetically or allophonically in the non-Northern Yukian languages
spoken in the region surrounding Yuki.","[70, 71, 72]"

is represented in the pages that follow, but this work would never have been possible
without the support of such a multitude of individuals.
   First and foremost, as this grammar is based on my doctoral dissertation, I wish to
express my deepest gratitude to the members of my dissertation committee, Marianne
Mithun, Sandy Thompson, Matt Gordon, and Carmen Jany. Their work, support,
counsel, and advice were not only instrumental in writing this grammar, but also to me
personally throughout the years during my graduate studies.
   Marianne Mithun introduced me to the Yuki language. We had previously already
cooperated on research on the Kato language, also spoken in Northern California in the
same region as Yuki. Shortly after that time Marianne suggested the Yuki language to
me as a possible focus for my dissertation. I’m fortunate and deeply grateful to
Marianne for suggesting this topic to me. I’m also deeply thankful for her support not
only during the research and writing of this grammar, but throughout the years of my
graduate studies and since that time. Our thought-provoking conversations on a vast
array of languages for which we both share a passion have meant a great deal to me
and have also helped shape and grow my thinking as a linguist.
   Sandy Thompson is the preeminent authority on the Wappo language, which is the
only well-documented genetic relative of Yuki. During the course of my graduate
studies I had the great fortune to cooperate with Sandy on other research involving the
emergence of language structures in connected speech. When I decided to write my
dissertation on Yuki, it seemed an amazing stroke of luck that I could have Sandy as a
member of my committee and to have the benefit of her advice and knowledge on
language structure and the Yukian languages in particular. I’m grateful and deeply
thankful for this and also for the many wonderful hours I’ve gotten to spend with
Sandy over these years discussing the many linguistic topics for which we share a deep
love.
   Matt Gordon and I both share an interest in the Finnic languages and also the
languages of Northern California. Early in my graduate studies Matt and I cooperated
on research on the prosody of Livonian and other less spoken Finnic languages. At that
time prosody was an entirely new field of linguistic study for me and I’m deeply
grateful to Matt for introducing me to this field and for allowing me to benefit from his
knowledge. Thanks to Matt and the research we cooperated on, I was able to write a
much more in-depth study of Yuki prosody for this grammar. I’m deeply thankful to
xxii                                AcknowledgementsMatt for this knowledge and his support and help over the years.
   Carmen Jany is the author of Chimariko Grammar, which was based on her
dissertation – a study very much like this grammar. Her work laid the foundation for a
great deal of my own thinking of how to approach the task of writing a complete
description of a language based only on archival material and a few recordings. I was
delighted when Carmen agreed to be a member of my committee and in the ensuing
months her insight, advice, and comments proved invaluable in bringing this grammar
to its final form. I’m deeply thankful and grateful to Carmen for all she has done to help
me complete this work.
   I wish to thank the speakers of Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki, as well as the
researchers who worked with these speakers. All of these individuals deserve a
profound amount of gratitude and appreciation for their labor and cooperation in the
documentation of these languages. In particular I would like to express my
indebtedness for the work of Yuki speaker Ralph Moore and Alfred L. Kroeber, which
yielded the amazing wealth of Yuki language material that allowed for this description
of the Yuki language to be written. Many other researchers have written excellent
studies of aspects of Yuki grammar, but I would express my gratitude and appreciation
in particular to Alice Schlichter-Shepherd for her excellent and insightful work. Yuki
Vocabulary, which she co-authored with Jess Sawyer, her study of Yuki tone, and
reconstruction of Proto-Northern Yukian proved invaluable in the course of the writing
of this grammar.
   I would like to thank Tim Powell and Charles Greifenstein of the American
Philosophical Society and Andrew Garrett, Justin Spence, and John Sylak of the Survey
of California and Other Indian Languages for their help during the course of my
research. I would like to express my gratitude to the American Philosophical Society
and the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages for providing the bulk of the
Yuki language materials I consulted in writing this grammar.
   I would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to Carol Genetti for her
teaching and the great amount that I learned from her about language documentation
and description. I would also like to express my thanks and appreciation to Willem de
Reuse for his friendship and for teaching me so much about field linguistics.
   I would like to express my deepest gratitude and indebtedness to Mary Rae Staton,
whose friendship, support, and counsel have meant so much to me during the years of
my graduate studies and since. I would also like to thank Dana Spoonerow, Karen
Barteld, Cami Helmuth, and Ra Thea for their kindness and help over the years. I would
like to thank Alex Walker for providing insight and information on the Southern Pomo

languages in the time we both were students at UCSB and in the years since that time. I
would also like to thank him for his help in finding certain articles and other materials
necessary to me during the editing of this grammar prior to its publication. I would also
like to thank Andrea Berez for her friendship, support, and good sense of humor during
the course of our doctoral studies. I would like to express my appreciation to Andra
Kalnača for the thoughtful insight regarding the wording of the dedication. I would also
like to express my deepest gratitude to Ofelia Zepeda, Leslie Tolbert, and Tapani
Salminen, for their support, friendship, and inspiration from my earliest years as a
linguist.
    My mother, Māra Trapāne, who shares my passion for language and knowledge, has
been a constant support and source of inspiration and encouragement throughout my
life and especially during my years of graduate school. My step-father, Andris Trapāns,
and my father, Agnis Balodis, unfortunately did not live to see the day that I completed
my doctorate, but both served as a model and inspiration to me for the joys of living a
life of the mind. I wish to express my deepest and most heartfelt love and gratitude to
my parents for all of their support and love over the course of my lifetime. I would also
like to thank them for teaching me and for raising me speaking our family’s Latvian
language. Though it is my first language, my initial interest in linguistics came through
my knowledge of Latvian and my fascination in comparing it to English and to its
relatives, Lithuanian and Old Prussian.
    I would also like to express a great measure of thanks to my entire family, both those
related to me by blood and those related to me by the bonds of love and friendship. The
encouragement and love of my husband, Caleb Roehrig, has been amazing and I’m
forever grateful to him for supporting me and being there with me through these
years. I’d also like to especially thank my good friend Dirk C. van Raemdonck whose
friendship, counsel, and insight have been so valuable to me throughout these years
and especially during the writing of this grammar and its subsequent editing. My dear

                                 1 . INTRODUCTIONUntil relatively recently, Yuki and the other Northern Yukian languages, Huchnom and
Coast Yuki, were spoken in Mendocino County in Northern California. This grammar is
based primarily on spoken narratives recorded in the first decade of the twentieth
century and therefore provides a description of the Yuki language as it was spoken at
that time.
   The narratives were provided by Yuki speaker Ralph Moore and recorded by Alfred
Kroeber. Supplemental examples were drawn from the large base of elicited material by
various other researchers over the course of the twentieth century. Where possible
information is also included on Huchnom and Coast Yuki, which together with Yuki
constitute the Northern Yukian languages, but which are far less extensively
documented than Yuki Proper. This was done to generate grammatical sketches of
Huchnom and Coast Yuki, and also to show how the Northern Yukian languages
compared to each other.
   Each chapter of this grammar addresses a different aspect of Yuki or its speakers.
Chapter 1 describes the genetic affiliation of Yuki, the location where it was spoken,
and information on dialect differences. Historical information on the Yuki people and
the consultants is also given in this chapter, along with a grammatical sketch of Yuki
and descriptions of the data, practical Yuki orthography, and past work on the
Northern Yukian languages. Chapter 2 explains the phonetics and phonology of Yuki.
The phonetic inventory, allophonic variation, and prosodic system of Yuki are
discussed. Chapter 3 details morphophonemic alternations. Chapter 4 gives an
introduction to information on word classes described in more detail in later chapters.
Chapter 5 covers Yuki argument structure and noun morphology. Chapter 6 describes
Yuki pronouns and associated morphology. Chapter 7 details Yuki verb morphology.
Chapter 8 describes Yuki adjectives. Chapter 9 discusses the Yuki numeral system.
Chapter 10 describes Yuki quantifiers. Chapter 11 covers Yuki adverbs. Chapter 12
discusses Yuki locative terms. Chapter 13 describes Yuki connectives and also a
selection of other minor words. Chapter 14 details the Yuki system of switch-reference
marking and coordinating suffixes. Chapter 15 is a description of Yuki clause structure.
   This grammar came about as a result of a dinner conversation and a great amount of
good fortune. Marianne Mithun suggested Yuki to me as a topic of study one evening at
a department dinner, while I was a graduate student at the University of California,
Santa Barbara. I went on a search motivated by my great interest in discovering all I
                                           1
2                        University of California Publications in Linguisticscould about Yuki and also by this quote found in Yuki Vocabulary authored by Jess
Sawyer and Alice Schlichter:       Unfortunately, the large collection of Yuki made by Alfred L. Kroeber is still
       unavailable and unpublished. Any analysis of Yuki grammatical structure must
       wait upon the availability of that material (Sawyer and Schlichter 1984:2)From this quote I knew that somewhere the materials existed to make my work
possible. In due course I discovered the location of these materials and started on the
journey to write a grammatical description of the Yuki language. This grammar came to
completion approximately a century after the publication of Kroeber’s original 1911
sketch of Yuki in The languages of the coast of California north of San Francisco.
   During the course of this work I found that as a result of a great coincidence, I wrote
large portions of this grammar only a few blocks away from the location where some of
the original narratives were recorded over a century ago. In his description of the
history of his work with Yuki, which I have included in the appendix of this grammar,
Kroeber states that he worked with Yuki speaker Ralph Moore in Covelo located in
Round Valley in Northern California, but that Moore would also come to San Francisco
to work with him. At the beginning of the Wildcat and Coyote Myth, Kroeber gives an
address in San Francisco (443 Eddy Street) as the location where these materials were
recorded. During research trips up to the University of California, Berkeley, I stayed
and wrote several chapters at a hostel in the historic Hotel Virginia near the corner of
Mason and O’Farrell in San Francisco, which happened to be located just a few blocks
away from this location given by Kroeber.

historical Yuki speech community, Yuki identity, dialect divisions, and contact
languages.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

  Arguments can be made for calling Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki dialects of a single
language or separate, but closely related languages. On one hand, they are grammatically very similar
and are thought to have been mutually intelligible (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:211, Golla 2011:188-189). On the
other hand, speakers of Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki inhabited ecologically distinct
territories and differed in terms of their significant ceremonies and myths (see §1.4). It is possible that
the relationships among the Northern Yukian languages were not unlike those among the Scandinavian
languages or Spanish and Portuguese; a group of distinct ethnicities speaking languages of a high degree
of mutual intelligibility. However, this may also be a question that could remain unanswerable due to the
lack of speakers of any of these languages or extant Coast Yuki and Huchnom communities.

  The Huchnom have also been referred to as the “Redwoods,” or by their Pomo appellation Tatu, while
the term Huchnom means “mountain people” (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:202). Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:155)
give a different translation for Huchnom. They connect it with Yuki huč ‘outside’, so that hučnom’ would
mean ‘outside people’. In Lamb’s (1955:27) notes, the pronunciation of “Huchnom” as spoken by his
consultant Lulu Johnson is given as hú̩čnó̩ˀom̥ in Lamb’s orthography or approximately [hutʃnoʔom̥] in
IPA. The [oʔo] segment is a result of the spreading of glottalization of the word-final glottalized sonorant
to the preceding vowel. This is a common process also in Yuki (see Chapter 2), therefore most likely
Huchnom was also pronounced as [hutʃnoʔm] in a form without this spreading. The Coast Yuki referred
to themselves as Ukoht-ontilka ‘ocean people’. (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:212)
4                        University of California Publications in Linguistics   The term “Yuki” has been used to refer to the Northern Yukian languages in general,
but also to the Yuki (Proper) language in particular. In order to avoid confusion, in this
grammar the term “Yuki” is used to refer only to the Yuki (Proper) language, while
Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki are collectively always referred to as
“Northern Yukian.”
   While Wappo is more different from all of the Northern Yukian languages than any
of these languages are from each other, the exact relationship among the three
varieties of Northern Yukian is unclear. Kroeber (1925 [1976]:211) writes that the Coast
Yuki considered their speech to be more similar to that of the Huchnom than that of
the Yuki. This would make a certain amount of sense as the Coast Yuki were
geographically closer to and likely in more frequent contact with the Huchnom than to
the Yuki. However, Kroeber notes that the lexicon of Coast Yuki seems to be about
equally similar to that of Huchnom and Yuki, but that a thorough analysis of the three
Northern Yukian varieties will be necessary before a final determination of internal
relationships can be made. In terms of intelligibility, Kroeber speculates that all three
languages must have been mutually intelligible to some extent, but that a Coast Yuki
unacquainted with either Huchnom or Yuki would not have been able to follow a
conversation fully in either of these languages.","[31, 32]"

       ‘Thereupon he asked him, “What was that, sister’s son, that you seemed to
       be telling about?” said Coyote to Jackrabbit, asking him.’     In Kroeber’s transcription, ˀi usually is written as a single word with the switch-
reference marker or switch-reference marker and coordinating suffix. In other
positions Kroeber typically writes it as a separate word, but its position suggests that it
is a clitic marking certain types of constituents as reported or uncertain knowledge.
This can be seen in the above examples where ˀi is marking the referent specified by
the switch-reference marking as reported and the quote as reported.
   ˀi is also often found affixed to larger constituents within a clause. In (109), the
argument ki lalkú:tk ˀaṭat ˀóykilnamlikimáse ‘those that had crowded into Lalkúhtki’ is
separated by ˀi from the verb míṭkilmil ‘filled up’ and its argument lál ‘lake’.","[299, 300]"

clauses. It seems from these examples that Coast Yuki may have employed a different
method for negation than Yuki or Huchnom. Negative clauses begin with ˀi:ma- or ˀi:mi-

the same way as in Yuki. A negative morpheme -t̯al is added to the verb in order to
negate it. The Huchnom negative -t̯ǝl appears similar in form to the Yuki negatives -ṭan
and ṭal-.

‘people’. In his recording of this text, Kroeber records k’olą́:ṭątap ‘to another’s place’ as an acceptable
alternate form for k’olą́:tk. However, there is precedent for dative =ąt occurring with another oblique case
ending following it for an animate argument. In the next clause, Coyote and the World: 95, terminative
=k’il is attached to a dative pronoun resulting in miyątkil’ ‘toward us’. Likewise, in Coyote and the
