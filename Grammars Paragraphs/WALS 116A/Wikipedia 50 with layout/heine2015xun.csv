"8.1 Imperative
Both the form and structure of imperative utterances are relatively uniform across the dialects.
Singular imperatives are generally formed by using the simple verb stem:
NI       ta!       ‘Go away!’ (said to children)
N2       gli    ki       djo,    ct      ke     tsa!
         night HAB       black lie       and    sleep
         ‘The night is dark, lie and sleep!’ (Bleek 1956: 182)
W2~      ha        ktndo’a              kweé    xa     = !dé!
         NI        then                 say     then     pull
         ‘He then said: Pull!’ (1/32)
         ue!                 ‘Come!’
         toa ui!             ‘Go (away)!
         u:!                 ‘Go, go (PL)!’
         ‘hin ha!            ‘Kill it!’
         Ixoa da’a!          ‘Make a fire!’ (Dickens 2005: 43)
         *m!                 ‘Eat!’ (KGhler 1973: 54)
         to’a!               ‘Go!’
     Pethaps more commonly, imperative and related interpersonal utterances consist of the
     tsonal subject pronoun referring to the person addressed and the verb stem:
         i         Iqi        tc’A—Ss   ml.
         2PL       NEG       steal      money

      In W1, imperative clauses may take either of the deontic modal markers sé or 6 before the          E2     wée!                       ‘Come!’

Interrogative pronouns                                                                             E3       hazoé xa          ha      tsi?
In the present section, the most salient interrogative pronouns are discussed in turn (the ques-           who   Q      Nl            come
tion particle is added in parentheses). These pronouns occur as a rule sentence-initially, even            ‘Who has come?’
though this is not a requirement.
                                                                                                      There is no fixed position in the clause for the interrogative pronoun madjé in W2, even if

(e) The numeral for ‘three’ is *!ao in NW-!Xun                     and C-!Xun but *n!anni in SE-!Xun (see sec-
tion 4.2.5). The latter can be assumed to be an innovation since *!ao is retained in SE-!Xun as
a pronominal plural marker (see section 4.1.1).

"   The marker *hé is homonymous with the noun class 1 proximal demonstrative of E1, E2,                                       W2
and E3 — i.e. of SE-!Xun. What distinguishes it from the latter is that it is not gender-                                              mi       ma         hi         daba                  ha~          @         a           nitin    ta         pee.

   Note that in E1, (a) is the only possible strategy used in non-restrictive relative clauses:                                         u-      a          dahma                 ha-        @            guhiin a.

E3, but it is also found in NW-!Xun. Dickens (1997: 108ff.) distinguishes two markers -a: one                                      ‘the person who went to |Aotcha and who killed his cow’ (Dickens 1997: 113)
that has low tone and serves as a relative clause marker, and another whose tone is a copy of
the preceding syllable, which is used (a) as a transitivity marker (see section 3.5) and (b) asa                     Since verbs of state used as nominal modifiers and demonstrative attributes also require the
suffix of compounds, marking the head of a compound (see section 6.1). This appears to be                            relative clause marker -d in El, being interpreted by Dickens (1997) as “verbals”, they also
the main reason why he treats demonstratives and what has been referred to by other authors                          replace the relative clause marker -a by hé (or its variant yé) for any non-first nominal mod-
as “irregular adjectives” as “verbals” (p. 110): they require the suffix -a on the preceding head                    ifier, that is, they behave exactly like relative clauses:

      The relative clause marker of SE-!Xun is -d, PL -sa@. The plural form -sa of E1, E2 and E3                                  person-REL        DI      REL     be.thin

> -sd. Synchronically, however, -s@ behaves like an invariable plural suffix which is used
even after nouns such as ji ‘people’ or n/p ‘eland(s)’ which ordinarily would not take the                                        ji-       oa      jaqm    yé      u-        4       |Aotcha

reflex of the transitive suffix *-a (see section 3.5).

it constitutes one of the most common means of relativization, used for both restrictive (a) and                            fact that the notion “adverbial clause” is not really appropriate for understanding clause

          ‘The hunter told me that he had killed the kudu.’ (Dickens 2005: 56)

      When the main clause verb is hé ‘find’ or tsa’ ‘hear, understand’, then (c) is used in EI:                  4.2.1, these are the noun class markers of classes 2 (*se, N2) and 3 (*yi, N3), respectively.

          ‘I understand that she got married yesterday.’ (Dickens 2005: 57)                                       now co-exist side by side in W1,              W2,    and W3,        while in N2 and the SE-!Xun           dialects the

                                               Preface    The present volume grew out of our work on the grammar of the !Xun language of southern
    Angola, northern and eastern Namibia and northwestern Botswana between 2000 and 2008.
i   Writing this book would not have been possible without the help of a number of people and
    organizations.
       A number of people have contributed in some way or other to this book. Our thanks are
    due in particular to Kofi Ayisa, Matthias Brenzinger, Naphtaly Chapwa, Laurentius Davids,
    Didier Demolin,   Carola Emkow,    Mats   Exter,   Wilfrid Haacke,   Christa Kilian-Hatz,   Rainer
    Vossen, as well as to other members of the Khoisan Forum of the University of Cologne, and
    the participants of the 2003, 2006, and 2008 Riezlern symposia on Khoisan linguistics for
    valuable discussions and comments. Furthermore, we wish to thank Henry Honken, Amanda
    Miller, Bonny Sands, and Akira Takada for sharing with us their field experiences and
    research findings, Bonny also for valuable comments on the present book, and to Monika
    Feinen for all the cartographical assistance that we were able to receive from her.
        Preliminary work leading to the book was carried out during our stay at various research
    institutions. We are indebted in particular to the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
    Sciences, Stanford, the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology of the Institute for Advanced
    Study (RCLT), Melbourne, and its directors Bob Dixon and Sasha Aikhenvald, to our col-
    leagues Lenore Grenoble and Lindsay Whaley, whose academic hospitality we were able to
    enjoy during our stay at Dartmouth College in 2002, to the Netherland Institute for Advanced
    Study (NIAS) during our research stay from 2005 to 2006, to Hilary Chappell and Alain
    Peyraube for providing us with an environment of academic stimulation during our research
    Stay at the Centre de Recherches Linguistiques sur l’Asie Orientale in Paris in 2007, and to
    the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, and in particular to Osamu Hieda, for making it
    possible that we could devote the academic year 2008/09 for further research in Japan.
       That we were able to carry out the field research leading to this book was due to a generous
    grant by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), to whom the
    first-named author wishes to express his deeply felt gratitude. We also wish to thank the
    University of Namibia and above all Wilfrid Haacke for all the support we received, the
    Government of the Republic of Namibia for granting us research permission, and the people
    of Namibia for the hospitality they offered us while we were working in this country.
       Most of all, however, we wish to express our gratitude to the many !Xun speakers in vari-
    Ous parts of Namibia, whose kindness, cooperation and patience we never ceased to admire,
    te ENS deeply obliged to them for generously sharing their language knowledge with us.
     t is hard to Single out individually which of them contributed
                                                                    most, but it is the following
    People from Ekoka village in Eenhana District, Namibia, who spent most of the time and
    min, with us: Jimmy Haushona Nllame, Simon Hampolo Nlume, the late Selma Hampolo
    ae Ban        a, and the people listed in table 1-7. A special word of thanks is due to
    Durin ‘i, erik Langman for letting us participate in his rich knowledge of the language.
    a     8 r Our stays in the !Xun-speaking area we were able to enjoy the warm hospitality and
        peration of the !Xun community. This book is therefore dedicated to them.

There is a locative root *ku which combines with the set of demonstratives to form locative                                           In W2, the locative pronoun may occur in positions typically reserved for nouns, e.g.,
pronouns or adverbs. Frequently, the root is linked with the demonstrative by means of the                                       W2        om       =m     [tb   ka   g       ki      nif.
relative suffix *-a. Preceding the proximal demonstrative *é, *ku-a- changes to *ku-e-. The                                                Isc      TOP    put   4    PR      LOC     some
shape this root takes is as follows (see also under section 8.2.2 ‘where?’):                                                               ‘I put it somewhere.’ P-NW            |*ku                                                                                                                 *ku or *kw-a occur occasionally as prepositional entities, e.g.,

   What distinguishes locative pronouns from corresponding demonstratives (see section                                           ‘Don’t take heavy stones!’
4.2.3.1) in W1 is the fact that they do not occur as nominal attributes but only as pronouns.
Otherwise, they behave similarly. Both may combine with an “emphatic pronoun” (section                             c.f           nlm        ma      ti.

   The locative root *ku is presumably derived from the Proto-!Xun noun *ké, PL *khoe                                 In W2, there is a class of adjectives which can be distinguished from verbs, in particular on
‘place’. In a number of its uses, the locative root still exhibits nominal properties of its nomi-                 account of the following properties:

Heikkinen has the following to say about adjectives in W1:                                                                       N4-        TOP __—be. good
        The reason why an adjective category has not been set up is that the non-action verbs,                                   ‘It is good.’
        which often appear as qualifiers in noun phrases, do not otherwise behave differently
        from other verbs and that many action verbs, too, both transitive and intransitive, appear
                                                                                                                                 *kKi       m4      (had.                                   adjective!?
        as qualifiers in noun phrases (Heikkinen 1987: 37).                                                                      N4-        TOP ss preen
In the following example, the verb n/a’a ‘be big (SG)’ is added to the noun as an “adjectival                                    ka       m4        (ha)       ka        hai.               adjective

      Still, Heikkinen’s assertion is in need of revision. There are a few items in W1 that func
tion exclusively as nominal          modifiers, even if there are verbs from which they are deriv                                gumi          ha-     @                 glé                verb
(Heikkinen 1987: 17), and we propose to call these items adjectives:                                                             Cattle.N1     Nl-     REL               come

What distinguishes the two classes of items in particular is that verbs have a lower final tom

(b) While verbals are predicative modifiers, requiring the relative clause markers -d, PL -sd,                       axe       good
adjectives are attributive modifiers, that is, they follow the noun without any formal linkage:                      ‘a good axe’ (Kohler 1973: 68)
E2      tef       jan                                                                                         Adjectives follow the noun and take the plural marking, whereas the preceding head noun

(i) Adjectives using the plural suffix -si:                                                                But the plural marker can as well follow the noun rather than the adjective (or quantifier), as
                                                                                                           the following example suggests:

Although all dialects have stable and commonly used numeral words for ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’,                                        children            two-   PL-                REL        DEM
there are reasons to question whether there is a numeral system in !Xun. First, numerals high-                       N2         mi         oleé     Ip.
er than ‘three’ are essentially never used; we have found no evidence of them in text collec-                                    1sG       one _    sit
tions on dialects. Second, while !Xun consultants readily supply higher numerals when asked                                      ‘T alone sit.’
to do so, there is much disagreement on which the “correct” one is; time and again, different

numerals are really associated with numeral values; accordingly, Heikkinen (1987: 20) says
that the numbers ‘2’ and ‘3’ in WI are not clearly defined concepts. And fourth, we have                                         lun       gle      !ao _       kilika.

Compared to many other languages, adpositions play only a minor role in !Xun, and whether                                ‘Tknow all ways but I don’t find baobabs on them.’ (KGhler 1973: 34)
they constitute a word class of their own is debatable. For example, Dickens (2005: 69) says
                                                                                                                    InN, *tf!qj can occur without a modifying noun:
that there are no adpositions (“prepositions”) in El, and the situation is not much different 0
other dialects, with the possible exception of N2. Still, as we will see below, there are some                 ya                   gt             aN,
items that we propose to call adpositions (both prepositions and postpositions).                                         NI      stay-     T       inside

    Secondary postpositions are what Dickens calls “locative nouns used in possessive con-                      in fact unambiguously a relational noun, and there can be little doubt that diachronically it is a
struction” in El. Many of them require to be headed by the primary postposition *fi!4 ‘in-                      noun. Nevertheless, in many of its other uses across dialects it corresponds both in its mean-
side’; compared to the primary postposition they have a more specific meaning, and they have                    ing and morphosyntax to what in other languages would be called a postposition: it has a
a much lower frequency of occurrence than the primary postposition. The following are ex-                       schematic function (inessive) and lacks categorial properties of nouns, such as taking the full
amples of secondary postpositions:                                                                              range of nominal modifiers or being conjoined with nouns. Furthermore, we argue that in its

ler (1973: 15) says that there are no morphological or tone classes of verbs, nor do verbs take

There is a weak verb—noun distinction in the sense that verbs can also be used as nouns or, as
Heikkinen (1987: 49) puts it for W1, “the simple verbal noun is equal to the verb root”. Thus,                     The number of elementary changes of state verbs is fairly small. Propositions expressing a

                                                                                                                W2         kinnf Inf mé                    !5-      4     a           loa     citi        !'H-   4.

The opposite does not apply, however; nouns cannot be used as verbs (see section 3.1.2.6).                                 ‘The tire of the car breaks but it is not yet broken.’

   One possible test on the behaviour of R and T is provided by topicalization, which is
formed in W2 by front-shifting the topicalized participant and setting it off from the rest of                W2         (7)    a.    dahma         ha      1é               4         ba     ke      (a4     gili?

    One of the most frequently employed ways of testing the differential status of R and T is
relativization: there are many constraints on non-arguments to be subject to relativization, and                                b.    tit   m4   ke    ia   th     ke    daba (ké_kiindd’a).

    However, things are slightly more complicated, and the following points have to be taken

      there is no object argument.

(viii) The suffix occurs only once per clause, while the use of the linker is recursive.                                              daba m4             4         cdé-     4       ti        ké     khome.

     There is no clear evidence that there is a phonological distinction short vs. long vowels in
any of the dialects. Nevertheless, whenever vowel length is found to be significant in some                    Plain + Gl                                ts’       tc’       ’       iM       !         i       +          kx’

other hand thorough skills in phonetics and phonology, which the present authors do not dis-
pose of. The following elementary sketch is meant to provide an overview of the main charac-
teristics of !Xun phonology; for more detailed analyses, see Heikkinen (1986) on W1, Doke
(1925) on C2, Snyman (1970), Dickens (1994), and Giildemann (2001) on El, and Kéhler
(1973, 1981) on E2. For discussion of specific aspects of phonology, see also Dickens (1994),
Miller-Ockhuizen (1998, 2000b), Miller-Ockhuizen & Sands (1999), Snyman (1973, 1975a,
1975b, 1977a, 1977b), Traill (1992), and Westphal (1971b).
    There is hardly any substantial information on phonology for most of the dialects. The
number of phonological units varies depending on the particular dialect, but it probably ex-
ceeds one hundred in all dialects; it remains unclear, however, to what extent these are in fact
all phonologically distinct units. Not included are tones and diphthongs, whose study would

large range of different participants. And third, both behave phonologically the same. For €x-
ample, we saw in section 3.5 that the El dialect has two -a suffixes where one has low tone
and serves relativization while the other is tone enclitic, assimilating to the preceding tone.
The latter is the transitive suffix covering both verbal and nominal valence. Similarly, in W1
and W2, both verbal and nominal -a behave the same, both assimilating a preceding high tone
to mid:

This item, which has been treated in some detail elsewhere (see especially section 3.5), also             N1             khGé, khoé
acts in some way as a derivational device in that it extends the transitivity pattern of the verb:                       -khdé (emphatic marker), -k6é

       Furthermore, *-a serves to derive adverbs from verbs and adjectives (see section 5.1).                  a has been grammaticalized via the notion ‘different places’ to a marker of reciprocity.

    Both partial and full reduplication of verbs have been observed, and in both types the tonal
patterns remain stable in the reduplicated constituent. The following notes refer to the E] dia-
lect, for which there exists some information (Miller-Ockhuizen 2000a, 2001). Reduplication
serves the following grammatical functions: (a) causativization, (b) repetition, (c) continuous
                                                                                         of these
 action, (d) intensity of action, and (e) turning non-telic verbs into telic ones. Which
functions is involved is lexically determined. While the tonal contours remain unaffected, full
                                                                                             first
reduplication differs from partial reduplication in that there is a tonal downstep after the
constituent. In the examples below, the former is distinguished from the latter by placing a
hyphen (‘-”) between the two constituents.

!Xun is a fairly isolating-analytic language having primarily, though not exclusively, head—
dependent order of constituents. There is no grammaticalized case system. Case relations are
marked in particular by means of the following:
(a) word order, used in particular to distinguish between subject and object,
(b) the transitive suffix *-a (see section 3.5), used for adding a participant not covered by the
    valence of the verb,
(c) the linker *ke in P-NW and *kd in P-SE (see section 5.2.2), introducing an additional par-
   ticipant, and
(d) verbal derivation (see section 6.2.2).
These generalizations, however, do not take care of the many pragmatically determined vari-
ations that are possible. The way the main case functions are typically encoded is summarized
in table 7-1.","[102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117]"

      There are various alternative word orders, in particular subject—object—verb (SOV; see be-                 W2       4.       ha     ma     di     (a)    mi     ké                           xan    dthali.

No compulsory argument marking                                                                                   While the basic word order is SVO, there is a second word order structure in all dialects, name-
Kohler (1973: 63) says that when transitive verbs are used in E2, the object is expressed even                   ly Sov, when specific matrix verbs taking either nominal or verbal complements are involved,
if this is not required by the context, as in the following example:                                             and this construction can be reconstructed back to P-X. Such a verb is P-X *kare ‘want’ (N1
E2     = nllé6    kd      faéq    haa.                                                                           ti, W1 karé, W2 kalé, K kéré, SE-!Xun *kare or *4ré), which usually takes the object before
                                                                                                                 the complement verb; hence, in such cases there is verb-final constituent order (see Snyman

This claim is not supported by the observations made on other dialects. Dickens, for example,

   Observations on narrative discourse in various dialects suggest that objects are frequently

In W2, subject participants are used fairly regularly, while complements tend to be omitted:                              pt     TOP    go-             T           house
Thus, all of the following sentences are well-formed:                                                                      He’s going home.’

“adverbs” that trigger the Sov construction. This construction must be used when the “ad-                               Ignoring this construction of W1, it would seem that there exists a canonical pattern of mark-

That the items in table 7-2 are verbs rather than adverbs is also suggested by the fact that the

is a derivation process whereby verbs can be turned into adverbs by means of the transit¥
suffix; accordingly, when they follow the verb, these items require the transitive suffix sil                                  tebe                 he      kx’ae    da’a.

   No single future marker can be set up for Proto-!Xun. Cross-linguistically, verbs for ‘go!
and ‘come’ are among the most common diachronic sources for future tense categories, and
!Xun offers a number of examples for both grammaticalizations: the existing morphemes are
mostly derived from the Proto-!Xun verbs *ti ‘go’ and *glé ‘come’. As the genetic distributio®
of these morphemes suggests, these must have been dialect-internal developments, hence:

In the preceding section we came across a suppletive verb, namely the NW-!Xun verb *la’a

‘give’, which has the form *na ‘give me’ when the object is a first person singular referent;

this marker back to Proto-SE as *ki. Dickens (2005: 26) treats El ki as an imperfective
marker used “to show that an action is continuous or habitual or unfinished”. This marker hi                                        has altogether three habitual markers: ki, kwd, and                              ua (or   6d). ki, frequently reduced
a number of additional functions, however. Kohler (1973: 52) calls E2 ké an “Aktionspart:                                                be used without a following verb base; cf. the following distinction:
kel”. The data provided by Kohler and Dickens suggest that El ku is best described as
                                                                                       a pt                                       mi       kho

and much the same applies to E3. Note that k# combines with the past tense marker to expire
habitual or continuous actions in the past.

"2.5 Morphotonological notes
Both segmental and suprasegmental phonemes are fairly stable across contexts. Nevertheless,
there are a few phonological changes in morpheme combinations; the following have been re-
ported:
(a) In W1 and usually also in W2 and W3, the transitive suffix (T) -@ causes a preceding high
tone to change to mid (Heikkinen 1987: 5):
Wl        7a        >           *t-a              “go to”
          ri-a      >           Pu-a              ‘put in’
W2 = de’fj-A >                  de’j-a            ‘cry for’
          glia      >           giI-a             ‘come to’
          ilj-a     >           Hlij-a            ‘put down’
          phi-4     >           phi-a             ‘fly away to’
          laé-A     >           laé-a             ‘die at, get drunk’
W3        Oona      u.                            ‘T go.’
          1SsG_     go
          na        t-          a        skél.    ‘I go to school.’
          IsG_      go-         T        school
      It is, however, also possible in W2                that the transitive suffix -a assimilates to a preceding
high tone:
W2~       «soa                  >        u-A                  ‘go to’
          ibu-a                 >        Vabu-a               ‘jump at’
(b) The low tone of the relative pronoun -é changes to mid (-é) if preceded by the ka (the
marker of noun class 4) in W2:
W2~=sona                 m      ka       é        ma          «kale!              (cf. -@ REL)
          give.me        food   N4-      REL      1SG_        want
          ‘Give me the food that I want!’
(c) The tone of the W2 verb /7 ‘to see’ is lowered following the causative prefix nities

Ignoring question words, adverbs and auxiliary elements that may also appear in the verb
phrase, the order of main constituents is as summarized in table 3-1. With the exception of the
verb stem (and in W2 and E3 the topic marker), none of these constituents is obligatory. The
verb stem may be extended either by the transitive suffix *-a (section 3.5) or by derivational
extensions (section 6.2.2).","[25, 26]"

This series is primarily concerned with the publication of source material on
the language, history and culture of the Khoisan speaking population of
Africa. It furthermore provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of
analytical linguistic studies. The series will appear at irregular intervals and
comprises both monographs and collections of papers. Contributions should

"2.4 Syllable structure
The clear majority of roots are monosyllabic. Syllables are almost invariably open, the only
consonant occurring syllable-finally being any of the nasals m, n, y [n], rarely also ny [p].
Heikkinen (1986: 19) observes that there are root-internal closed and open syllables in W1.
Only few consonants occur as the second consonant in disyllabic roots in this dialect: b (8), r,
mM, Nn, C, S, X, w, y, and ’ (glottal stop). Monosyllabic roots have only nasals (m, y) as a final
consonant (W1; Heikkinen 1986: 18).",[25]

The orthography used here is essentially that proposed by Dickens (1991, 1994, 2005), and all
conventions used by other authors will be adapted to the present orthography. There are a few
Cases where, for phonetic and comparative consistency, we diverge from Dickens; with one
exception these cases involve ejective plosives. The relevant cases are presented in table 2-2;
concerning conventions of marking tones, see section 2.4 below.",[19]
