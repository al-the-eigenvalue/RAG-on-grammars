"         Kide also asks ‘which?’, in presenting a choice between multiple
entities. Where the entities in question are all members of the same noun
class, kide will bear the appropriate bound class proclitic.        This is
demonstrated for the ‘animal’ class in 9-21.      9-21    gagu            a-kide      derrigidi-yerim

"       In 4.4.1 we noted that the stative simple verbs are to be understood as
describing the presence of a subject in a particular location, spanning a
period of time throughout which the subject's stance remains unchanged.
Contrastively, the dynamic simple verbs allowed for a more general
interpretation of movement about the place, without any implication that
the activity in question is necessarily in progress at all times. Given the
requirement of unchanged stance, stative verbs describe temporary states
whereas dynamic simple verbs have an association with semi-permanent
states through their habitual and iterative readings.      This opposition
between transitory and permanent perspectives provided by the distinction
between stative and dynamic simple verbs, is also exploited in their copula
functions. Examples 4-61 and 4-62 above both have 'sit' marking transient
existential states. Compare them with the permanent perspective conveyed
by the dynamic simple verb ‘go’ in existential function, in 4-63.      463    yu   mem-nimbi        mipurr gagu       wadditye

"       Kene enquires about the identity of people only, and can be thought of
as the human equivalent of tyagani. Where kene can ask only about living
humans, tyagani ‘what’ must be used to ask about inanimates, lower
animates, spirits, corpses and ancestral beings. The distinction between
humans and non-humans is then quite rigid. The response to a kene
question will always identify a particular person.

being a verb root. Yityi- forms a complex verb in combination with only the

"1.5     Fieldwork Methodology and Grammar Writing
1.5.1   Getting started
        In 1981 I had just completed a Batchelor degree in linguistics, and
found myself inspired by one of Bob Dixon's courses in Aboriginal
linguistics to do some real fieldwork of my own. Wary of committing
myself to a post-graduate course, I canvassed around the ANU linguistics
department to find someone who I could accompany on their fieldtrip. This
I felt would satisfy my curiosity, giving me a taste of fieldwork, and at the
same time leave me in a position that I could back out of, if need be. Ian
Green took me up on my enthusiastic but completely deceitful promises to
cook, do the washing, and write up his paradigms and verb cards etc, and
took me to the Daly on the first of his Ph.D fieldtrips. Ian was learning
Marrithiyel from Bill Parry, so we ended up in Bill's camp on the west side
of the Daly river. Three elderly women in Bill's camp (including his wife)20Several of the features of New Ngan‘gikurunguurr that are mentioned here, including this
function of -gimin (H&K 1988:219), can be found in Hoddinott and Kofod's grammar of
Ngankikurungkurr. Their main informant is a ‘school generation’ New Ngan’gikurunggurr
speaker.

collecting ochres/firewood with some site-mapping, fulfilling Robert's
custodial role in certain estates, and the odd bit of fishing. Patrick Tyabada
frequently accompanied us on these trips, contributing his own stories and
general hilarity. While the bulk of my NgW data comes from a small
number of informants, I have regularly tested its acceptability within the
wider community of NgW speakers (see acknowledgements).
        Most of the Peppi community took an interest in my developing
language skills, making an effort to avoid speaking English to me, and
randomly testing my knowledge of words and expressions.               My more
spectacular errors (quite unrepeatable) featured regularly in community
gossip. This level of interest, though occasionally embarrassing, greatly
improved my conversational fluency in NgW.
        From the start Ngan'gityemerri people have always been keen to
have their language ‘written down’.           Although I have always been
encouraged by this expression of support, initially I felt uneasy about what
seemed to be two unstated inferences: that the language would somehow be
saved by this process, and secondly that my thesis would constitute some
sort of language resource that they could refer to like a dictionary. My
explanations of what my thesis would and would not be, produced varied
responses. Some people were plainly puzzled; if I was not producing a
resource for native speakers, or drills for language learners, just who would
use this book ? Others were quick to point out my obligations to make
available those products of my work that were of more immediate use, texts
and wordlists particularly.
       At Peppimenarti I was actively encouraged to work in the school, and
together with Terry Sam began a school-based language program. Although
we did develop and teach the orthography used here and commence
wordlists for each child, the main focus of this program has always been on
different ‘languages’.  Within a single ‘language’, people listening to a narrative will, in
whisper, query the acceptability of unusual auxiliary(+bodypart)+verbroot combinations,
and derisively hoot at erroneous or implausible ones. Within this context, my discussions
with informants about the acceptability of particular grammatical constructions, was not
considered particularly odd by them. Of course the responses I got were subject to all sorts of
variables, and where these were    uncontrollable, I have avoided relying on this material at
all, unless natural contexts could verify them. So while much of the description contained in
this thesis is based on the grammar of narrative text, and most of the examples cited are
taken from recorded texts, my understanding of such issues as bodypart incorporation and
auxiliary semantics in particular, owes a significant debt to the process of solid formal
elicitation.

building a collection of video resources, with the assistance of the National
Aboriginal Languages Program, that one day may be ‘patched in’ to local
television transmission.
1.5.3 Approach to Grammar Writing
        My approach to writing a grammar of Ngan'gityemerri falls fairly
squarely within the traditions of what Wilkins (1989:58) has referred to as
‘The ANU School of Australian Grammatical Description’. This tradition
places a high priority on the use of descriptive practices that best reflect the
linguistic system in question, and are sensitive to the cultural context of its
usage. Grammars written within this tradition are highly eclectic in their
use of linguistic theory, drawing on whatever grammatical tools best
achieve these descriptive aims, without being overly concerned about, as
Evans (1985:xii) puts it, ""whether they all come from the same toolkit"".
Writers within this tradition employ, and acknowledge their use of,
whatever theories best handle the particular aspect of the language they are
describing. At the same time they are wary of 'fad’ theoretical terminology,
believing that a grammatical description written in the most straightforward
language and containing a large number of natural language examples will
best allow the reader to judge the accuracy and internal consistency of the
description.
        I began this description of Ngan’gityemerri with the intention of
providing a full reference grammar of the language. I have been forced to
reduce the scope of this work by the realisation that languages having such
morphological density as this one does, cannot be adequately treated within
the thesis wordlength limitations imposed by the university. This thesis
cannot really be called a ‘grammar’, for it does not adequately cover some
aspects of the language, and others not at all. I have given fairly detailed
descriptions of the phonology and nominal and verbal morphology. As this
is a language in which the verb is “where the action is"", I have further
chosen to explore two of the most interesting aspects of the verb; the
incorporation of bodypart terms into the verbal complex, and the semantics
of the auxiliary verbs.","[48, 49, 50, 51]"
"       Among the verbs that are formulated with the ‘hands’ auxiliary,
there is a subset of verbs that have 3rd singular, but non-recoverable, agents
and cross-reference their patients as direct objects. Consider the examples
below.      4-131 minmipi     demim -ngi-yiri
            funnybone   3sgHands-1sg-numb
                        SU Pres DO
             My funnybone is numb.
             (lit: It is making my funnybone numb.)
      4-132 kikilik           deminy -ngi-tip
            cough/flu        3sgHands-1sg-grab
                             SU Perf      DO
             I had the ‘flu.
             (The flu had grabbed me. ?)      4-133 deminy -ngi-tyerr -tati
            3sgHands-1sg-mouth-open
            SU Perf      DO          redup
            I yawned.
            (lit: It repeatedly opened me at the mouth.)      4-134 demim_       -ngi-ge        -bul
             3sgHands-1sg-belly-heat
             SU Pres     DO
             I'm getting angry.
             (lit: It is heating me in the belly.)       The obvious question to ask of these impersonal verbs is 'why are
they constructed with the ‘hands’ auxiliary?’. Certainly, despite the above
noted, and independently establishable, psychological reality of the semantic
components of auxiliaries, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that
Ngan'gityemerri speakers view verbs such as 'to be (made) angry’ in terms
of any literal notion of ‘grasping hands'. While speakers will readily
invoke the instrumental use of hands and feet in explaining the difference
between pairs of verbs such as given in 4-122 above, they make no recourse
to 'hands' imagery in explaining the selection of the ‘hands’ auxiliary in
impersonal verbs. However, for at least some impersonal verbs we can
establish equivalent active verbs with clearly identifiable subjects. Compare,
for instance, 4-135 below with 4-132 above.

"      In their copula functions ‘sit’, ‘lie’, ‘stand’ 'go' and ‘go* are used to
encode the existence/location of, or ascribe attributes to their subjects.
‘Existential’ clauses are simply statements about the existence of entities
with respect to space and time. 'Ascriptive’ clauses employ the simple
intransitive auxiliaries to ascribe certain characteristics to their subjects.
These characteristics can be expressed as either adjectives or through
attributive NP's. As copulas ‘sit’, ‘lie’, ‘stand’, 'go' and ‘go*' are used for
both inanimate and animate subjects, necessitating a rather broader view of
each posture.       The discussion of posture below is exemplified with
existential clauses.
       In addition to animates that are in an obviously prone/supine
posture, any inanimate that is not raised off the ground, and is conceived of

wielded by an agent in effecting an action, for these issues form the central

translation. I've been fairly free with translations, attempting, in addition to
an accurate rendition, to convey something of the speech style. To this end,
in a few cases I have translated using expressions that are characteristic of
the English of Ngan'gityemerri speakers, but which may be less well known
in standard Australian English.
         The use of brackets ( ) in the fourth line of examples either provides
contextual information which is missing from the given example, but
established within the wider discourse, or clarifies implications of the
example. e.g. I brought it for her (to give to her), (on her behalf), (at her
request) etc. A bracketed sentence below the line-4 translation is an
alternative translation.
         Example numbers are of the form 3-56, where 3 denotes the chapter
number, and 56 denotes the example number within that chapter. Examples
in each chapter are renumbered from 1. Ngan'gikurunggurr examples are
marked by 'NgK’ below the example number. All examples not designated
as NgK should be understood to be Ngan'giwumirri, unless specified in the
text as some other language.

"      The notion of ‘accompaniment, as marked by -werre, differs from the
notion of ‘instrumental use’, marked by -ninggi-, in terms of the degree to
which the entity in question falls within subject control. In contrast to
comitative NPs, the prototypical instrumental NP is inanimate, devoid of
self-will, and in human hands is totally manipulable. In 6.1.2 we saw that
speech, tools, weapons etc, are the best examples of instruments, and are the
kinds of entities that will be always marked in that role with -ninggi.
        However, between self-willed humans that one accompanies, on the
one hand, and inanimate objects that one uses, on the other, there is a grey
area of ‘non-human animates' and ‘not-very-manipulable inanimates'
which can be variously viewed as filling either comitative or instrumental
roles. Thus, in view of their self-will, horses are treated as comitative in
6-29. Likewise in 6-30, an inanimate raft is treated as a comitative, in view
of its limited manoeuvrability (especially in contrast with the handheld
steering pole). Note though that in both these examples the horse or raft
could quite acceptably be viewed as functioning in an instrumental role and
correspondingly marked with -ninggi.         6-31 below demonstrates the
acceptability of variously viewing dogs in an accompanying role, or in an
instrumental role.      6-31   a)      wu-wu-werre      waddi-@       -dudu -tye

          The functions of -werre and -ninggi clearly overlap here. Things that
fall fully within subject control, like speech, tools, weapons etc, are most
likely to be designated as ‘instruments’ by being marked with -ninggi. On
the other hand, things that fall less fully under subject control, things which
can be considered to possess a degree of self-will, like humans and higher-
animates, are most likely to be treated as comitatives and marked with
-werre.

6.1.5     -nimbi            SOURCE
          -nimbi has two related functions, glossed as ‘SOURCE' and 'CAUSE'.
As a marker of ‘source’ -nimbi can only function adnominally as an enclitic
                                                                                                      ee
to the final constituent of an NP, denoting that NP as a spatial or temporal
                                                                                                      ee
point of origin. Marking ‘cause' however, -nimbi can function either
adnominally, marking an NP as the cause of some resultant condition, or
predicatively, denoting an entire clausal proposition as the cause of some
resultant proposition. Functioning predicatively -nimbi is an enclitic to the
                                                                                                      me es eee ce
verb root.         The adnominal ‘source’, adnominal ‘cause’                    and predicative
‘cause’ functions of -nimbi are contrasted in 6-32 to 6-34.

"       Verb root reduplication in punctual verbs, on the other hand, can            RETonly be interpreted as a marker of iteration, not duration. The reason for

durative in the sense that-they can be iterative. Put another way, punctiliar
verbs can only be seen to extend over a period of time, in the sense that they
can be thought of as a series of repeated actions.
       In this analysis I have chosen to describe iteration in terms of
duration, not the other way round. It intuitively seems more plausible to
                                                                                    ROR
view an iterative activity like ‘coughing’, in terms of duration, rather than
attempt to account for a durative activity, like ‘sitting’, in terms of ‘a series
of repeated events’.
       Examples of reduplicated verb roots in strictly punctiliar verbs, are set
out in 3-255 below.

interpretations of reduplicated verb roots that is governed by the
punctual/non-punctual conception of an activity, can best be demonstrated
by looking at the interaction between these verbs and the auxiliary inflection          ee                       .
system.    One of the Ngan'giwumirri auxiliary inflectional categories,                = ae ; a _—
labelled Past Imperfective, is strongly associated with imperfectivity.   Verbs        cr
denoting activities that are conceived of as being strictly punctual, cannot             ee                  :
select the Past Imperfective auxiliary inflection unless their verb stems are          a         a . a       -
reduplicated.    Thus the inherently punctual verb 'to cough’ in 3-256 a)              pose
below is acceptable because the verb root is reduplicated, but 3-256 b), with an
unreduplicated verb root is not.      3-256 a)      nginni_       -kikilik-tye

                    We (plex) were coughing.
The unacceptability of 3-256 b) stems from the incompatibility of a
conceptually punctual activity, subcategorising for an auxiliary inflectional
category that is inherently imperfective. 3-256 a) is acceptable because a
punctual activity like ‘coughing’ can be compatible with imperfective /
durative auxiliary inflection, only where it is explicitly marked as iterative
by reduplication of the verb root.
       Returning to the issue of additional interpretations that fall under the
umbrella of iteration, we have already seen in 3-255 b) above, that verb root
reduplication in punctiliar verbs can be suggestive of many subjects
performing the same action. In punctiliar transitive verbs, the implication
of object plurality is even stronger. Compare the difference brought to the
following pairs of sentences by the reduplication of the verb root.       3-257 a)       wamanggal      werrbeny-da

              and then there was pygmy geese, bandicoots, goannas, eagles,Two devices are employed here to keep track of the fact that this is a list of
connected names. Firstly, note that the ‘animal’ generic gagu is included
with every second or third listed noun. Secondly, ninde ‘and then’ prefaces
that part of the list that constitutes a second breathgroup, i.e. when the
speaker had to stop and take a breath because the list was so long, he began
again with ninde.        Ninde         thus indicates that what follows is to be
understood as a continuation of what preceded. Given the comparative
rarity of such lengthy strings of conjoined elements, there are few tokens of
ninde in my data.
       E can be used to conjoin either NP's or clauses, as in 7-29 and 7-30,
though like ninde, few examples are found in either text or conversation.
The rare use and typically slow delivery of e suggests that it is in fact as
much a hesitation device as a connector.       7-29   teacher wurruke          Glene           Tony

utterances on their own. They typically express a reaction to an event, either
linguistic or extra-linguistic (cf. Laughren 1982:132). Several of the particles

In terms of Hé&K's analysis, 3-21 b) above is marked for both perfectivity and
imperfectivity; perfectivity denoted by the dV- subject marker,                        and
imperfectivity by the serialised stance auxiliary wirribem.
         I find the variation between gV- and wV- subject marking to be a
contrast between remote and proximate, not simply in deictic terms, as
Laves has suggested, but also in conceptual terms. In my data the vast
majority of present tense verbs showing gV- subject marking employ stative
auxiliaries, either the postural '‘sit', ‘lie’, and ‘stand’ auxiliaries, as in
examples 3-22 to 3-25, or the motional ‘go' and ‘go*’ auxiliaries, as in
examples 3-26 to 3-28. With stative auxiliaries gV- marking denotes states
that are remote from the speaker, either spatially distant or conceptually
distant - activities or states that are in some way outside the speaker's
immediate world, perhaps out of sight as in 3-23 and 3-24 below, or perhaps
beyond the speaker's firsthand knowledge. In the example glosses wV-
subjects are given as SU (Subject), and remote gV- subjects as SR (Subject
Remote).         3-22   __...peyi -pefi            gitrim, nginyirri-wurr

"2.1.3.1    Prominence of Active Articulators
        In the descriptions of many Australian languages ‘place of
articulation’ is typically viewed as a significant criterion in the analysis of
consonant phonemes. This term puts implicit and, for Ngan'gityemerri,
inappropriate focus on the passive articulator. In both Ngan'gikurunggurr
and     Ngan'giwumirri,      which   make   no     contrastive   distinction   between
alveolar and retroflex, or (inter)dental and palatal, there is nothing to be
gained by making an analysis in terms of passive articulators. In preference
we have four types of ‘active articulation’, one involving both lips -
‘bilabial’, and three involving types of tongue configuration          -'apical',
‘laminal' and ‘dorsal’.
        This type of system that focusses on tongue configuration, allows for a
wide range of mouth-roof space within which the tongue can make its
contact (or approximation). The contact point of apical phonemes thus
ranges from alveolar to postalveolar, and that of laminal phonemes ranges
from interdental to palatal. It is only at the allophonic level that we need
invoke the criterion of ‘place of articulation’. Elsewhere throughout this
work reference to phoneme types is made only in terms of active
articulators.
2.1.3.2 Realisation of Obstruent Phonemes
/p/ -       The bilabial stop [p"") is always voiceless, aspirated and long
            with no variation in closure type./b/ -       The bilabial stop [b] is always voiced and unaspirated, and is
            consistently shorter than the voiceless stop. However it exploits
            durational difference to a far lesser degree than is found for
            other articulator types (see 2.2.2). /b/ shows less fluctuation in
            closure type than do the other voiced stops, being always fully
            stopped.            is a bilabial fricative [9], lightly spread and with a small degree
            of lip tension. Observation of speakers' lip movement shows
            this sound to be truly bilabial, in that the teeth are not visible
            and the upper and lower lips are aligned and make even
            contact. However this sound has some of the turbulent quality
            (auditory correlate of energy higher in the spectrum) that is
            normally associated with labiodental articulation. The
            presence of this turbulence suggests that the lip spread and
            tension pulls the top lip sufficiently tightly against the upper
            teeth that they act as joint articulators in opposing the bottom
            lip. Even if the upper teeth do not actually come into contact
            with the lower lip, they at least approach it closely enough to
            generate wake turbulence. Among the younger speakers of
            Ngan'gityemerri, (who have been exposed to a considerable
            amount of Standard English through their schooling and, more
            recently, through television), this fricative is usually realised as
            a true labiodental [f].
            As has been noted for all other Australian languages that have
            both a stop contrast and fricatives, the contrast does not extend
            to the fricatives (Dixon 1980:215). /f/ is always voiceless
            initially, and varies between voiced and voiceless when
            intervocalic or post-liquid. /f/ only occurs post-nasally across a
            morpheme boundary in which environment it remains
            voiceless.            2-18   funggulu(NgW)       - sugarbag          [dangolu]

               This tendency towards voicing assimilation (assuming [9] to be
               the unmarked allophone), is much stronger in
               Ngan'giwumirri than it is in Ngan’gikurunggurr. A text count
               of word medial /f/ indicates about 80% are voiced in
               Ngan'giwumirri, compared with only about 15% in
               Ngan'gikurunggurr. Although this variation in the degree of
               glottal pulsing through the approximation duration of medial
               /£/ is biased differently in each dialect, it is still ‘free’ variation
               in the sense that it is non-contrastive within the phonological
               system of each dialect’.
               Finally, a very minor allophone, a voiceless bilabial fricative
               with labiodorsal secondary articulation [$”], has been recorded
               as a free variant of word initial [] in a single word only.               2-19    fa(K)-                beeswax       [$a] ~ [$a]
3We can further observe a type of ‘fixed’ variation, whereby certain cognate lexemes are
invariably realised    with      voiceless    /f/      in Ngan'gikurunggurr,     and    voiced   /f/   in
Ngan'giwumirri.

markers; that is, the minor phonetic differences between them are strictly and invariably
maintained as evidence of the separate identities of the two groups, usually at other levels
(eg. political). In discussion of these words, speakers will carefully point out that “we say it
this way, but that other mob say it this way"". So despite the non-contrastive nature of the
feature tvoice among fricatives within the phonological systems of each of these languages,
the same feature is employed cross-dialectically, within a subset of the lexicon at least, to
flag linguistic identification. How, within the scope of the general lexicon, certain lexemes
come to be employed in this manner remains a question for further study. Note though that
these kinds of examples nicely illustrate Labov's observation that there is really no such
thing as free variation, if social and stylistic variables are considered to constitute part of
the conditioning environment.
               We can partially account for the occurrence of this minor
               allophone by noting that this word is already marked as
               phonotactically odd, being one of only a handful of
               monosyllables, and one of only two beginning with /f/.
               The labiodorsal variant is unlikely to be the reduced form of an
               underlying disyllabic lexeme /fuwa/, because such a word
               would be equally phonotactically odd, as the labial semivowel
               is otherwise unattested between these vowels. And there are
               no other examples of [$”a] to suggest that all such underlying
               segments may have undergone reduction of this sort.               is a long voiceless aspirated apical stop [t""] with no variation in
               closure type.               is a short voiced apical stop. Both /t/ and /d/, but particularly
               /d/, exploit a fairly wide range of mouth-roof contact points,
               from alveolar [d] to post-alveolar   [d]. The degree of retroflexion
               found in apical stops is sensitive to the environment.       I
               perceive initial and intervocalic /d/ to be more retroflex than
               post-nasal /d/, and /d/ after back vowels to be more retroflex
               than /d/ after front vowels.
               Intervocalic /d/ can be very short, especiallyin unstressed
               syllables, and ir this environment is frequently
               reduced to an alveolar aproximant [1]. This realisation of /d/
               can be consistently distinguished from the post-alveolar
               continuant /r/ (also given below as [1] 4) by its shorter duration
               and lack of retroflexion.              is a voiced retroflex fricative. This sound is described by Capell
              as a ""retroflex rhotic with fricated release""(quoted in H&K
              1988:16), and by Hoddinott and Kofod as a ""retroflex fricative
              with rhotic release""(Hé&K 1988:16). Neither of these
              descriptions are particularly accurate in articulatory terms, if for
              no other reason than that neither fricatives nor rhotics have
              ‘release’. I do agree with both authors though, that auditorily
              there is a definite r-colouring to the realisation of this
              phoneme. This in itself presents a descriptive problem as the
4Note   that IPA (1989 update) provides no satisfactory mechanism   for differentiating
between alveolar and post-alveolar approximants.

           SU    PresThis example raises the possibility that this fricative has
developed diachronically from a cluster of flaps, ie /rr/ + /rr/.
Its restricted word position potential and low functional load
are additionally suggestive of fairly recent development.
However within the contemporary phonemic system we need
to accord /s/ phonemic status to account for its contrastive use
in such examples as asiminmin in 2-20 above.is a laminal stop; voiceless aspirated [ch] in word initial
position and intervocalically, and short and voiced [5]
postnasally. For those articulator types having a contrast
between two series of stops, the post-nasal environment is
‘neutralised’. For the laminals however, in the absence of a
contrastive voiced laminal phoneme, we would specify [ J] as a
post-nasally conditioned allophone of /ty/.

                                        Trip to Melbourne
                                         Speaker - Robert Daly
                              Recorded at Peppimenarti in September 1988
                                    (AIAS Reid NgW Tapes 8 & 9 1988)
This text was given by my main Ngan'giwumirri teacher Robert Daly, shortly
after his return from a trip to Melbourne where, as an accomplished ‘bamboo
man', he and a Marrisyebin singer named Martin Warrigal were invited to
perform at an ethnomusicological conference.            What is given here is of
necessity an extract, for the full text runs for over two hours and 100 pages of
transcription. This text contains many features that are typical of Robert's
narrative style; extreme detail given to travel, including all stops, and people
met with along the way (getting from Peppimenarti to Melbourne takes 38
pages); great care taken to recount events in their correct chronological order;
and determination to describe non-traditional things (such as trams and
escalators) in his own language where possible, without lapsing into English. At
the same time this text is full of new impressions; the Melbourne zoo, trams,
escalators, restaurants, performing before large crowds of strangers, and
uncertainty of the rules of such aspects of college life as smorgasborg meals and
communal bathrooms. We take the story up from their arrival at their lodgings.mipurr kinyi wagarri    ngem       _-burrki-pal -tye dede                     Darwin-nimbi,

"13In this respect ngan- differs from an otherwise similar morpheme in Marrithiyel. The
Marrithiyel form ni corresponds very closely to Ngan'gityemerri ngan- in both its combination
with major bodypart terms to form a CVS, and in its relative clause function (Green 1989:300-
7). However Marrithiyel ni appears to have a more general relative function, in that it is not
restricted to a locative/destination interpretation, and can be compatible with static location
verbs, as in the example below taken from Green (1989:301). (While I have supplied Green's
translation, for comparative purposes I have taken the liberty of providing the interlinear
gloss in terms of the conventions used for Ngan'gityemerri).

"Triconsonant Clusters:   C2 C3 +Cq
        Triconsonant-clusters do not occur intra-morphemically. They are
produced only across morpheme boundaries, as the result of two
morphological processes: reduplication and affixation.        Triconsonant-
clusters resulting from each of these processes are examined separately here,
as there are differences in the number       of clusters they generate, and the
types permitted in surface forms.
       In Ngan'gityemerri there are a small group of monosyllables having
final CyC3 clusters (see 2.3.1), e.g purrk ‘clap’. The reduplication of such
syllables generates triconsonant-clusters of the form      C;VO€2C3C;VC2C3.
C3, as we saw above, is restricted to the peripheral stops/nasal /p k ng/. The
C; can be any of /pkmng/.
                           Triconsonant     Clusters
                                     Figure 2-12
However, as the examples below show, /p/ has not been recorded in C3 in a
triconsonant cluster, and /k/ has not been recorded in C;. Given that /p/
appears as C3 in C2Cs3 clusters in unreduplicated syllables, eg ngurrp ‘emu’,
and /k/ otherwise appears in C;, these gaps appear to be accidental rather
than in any way systematic.

resizicted by the small number of monosyllabic C;1VC2C3 words, but where
C3 and Cy, share the same        manner     of articulation they are subject to a
morphophonological rule that deletes C3 (see 2.4.1).
       In contrast the process of affixation generates a far wider number of
triconsonant-clusters, all of which are permitted (i.e. clusters where C3 and
C4 share the same manner of articulation are not affected by the rule
discussed in 2.4.1).
      Monosyllabic verb roots ending in C2C3 clusters are typically followed
by consonant initial verbal enclitics.      2-66 a)         ngi -purmk-pe                     I'll dance, clap.

     Structure of Examples
              Examples are structured as four lines. The first line is the
     Ngan'gityemerri sentence/word in bold script. Loanwords are treated in
     one of two ways. English loans which essentially retain their English
     phonemicisation and meaning are given in the first line of examples in
     plain rather than bold script, to denote their status as loan words (or in some
     cases, code-switching). Loans from English which have been phonemicised
     into Ngan'gityemerri, or have acquired new or extended meanings as
     loanwords are given in bold script and provided with an interlinear gloss on
     lines two and three (i.e. in accordance with Ngan'gityemerri speakers’
     perception of such words, I have treated them as ‘proper NgK or NgW’).
     The second and third lines of examples, in italic script, provide an
     interlinear gloss. I've found the use of two lines necessary simply because of
     the morphological density of the verb in particular. Lines 2 and 3 are meant
     to be read jointly from left to right, rather than sequentially. For instance,
     the gloss to the example given below should be read as;                    wuddumbuny-ngerr -mi -wul        -nime-pagu
                    3pl Shove   -dl/1sg-Val-return- tr | -HITH
                    SU Perf       Su/DO              su
                    They (three) brought me back here.     ""third plural subject, ‘shove’ auxiliary in perfective inflection, portmanteau
     dual subject and first singular direct object, valence increaser, return (verb
     root), trial subject, hither directional”
              As evident in the above example, I use a slash / between the glossed
     elements of a portmanteau morpheme.          Another minor convention is the
     inclusion, below the verb root, of the meaning of the verb. This is given
     only in those verbs whose meaning is unpredictable from the combination
     of the auxiliary and verb root semantics.
Se
              Auxiliary roots are glossed by name (e.g. 'Shove' in the example
     above). The semantic nature of auxiliary verbs is discussed in detail in
     chapter 5, and readers seeking explanation of auxiliary root glosses are
     referred to this section. The 31 auxiliary names are listed below.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"

       Hoddinott also collected some Ngan'giwumirri data, presumably in
the early 1970's’, and the bound object pronouns provided in Hoddinott
and Kofod (1989:103), concur with Laves' Ngan'gimerri data in showing the
same distinction between dual Direct and Indirect Object pronouns. The
complete absence of distinct dual DO and IO pronouns in the speech of the
Ngan'giwumirri people that I worked with between 1986 and 1988, suggests
that this distinction has only been lost in very recent years. I never heard
7According to Kofod he collected Ngan'gikurunggurr material during four fieldtrips, in 1967,
1972, 1973 and 1982. His Ngan'giwumirri data was presumably also collected on one or more of
these trips.
the dual direct object forms (given by Laves and Hoddinott & Kofod)
spontaneously uttered.
       In conclusion I would suggest that there has been a general process of
neutralisation of the non-singular bound Direct and Indirect Object
pronominal paradigms.       As the data of Laves and Hoddinott & Kofod
suggest that there was in recent times a contrast between DO and IO in both
the singular and dual number categories, we could hypothesize that at an
even earlier stage the contrast may have also been found in the plural
forms. The hypothetical neutralisation of the plural pronouns would have
predated Laves' 1930 work, and the neutralisation of the dual forms would
appear to have taken place over the last few decades. Note that this
neutralisation has involved the loss of the Direct Object forms, and that it is
the Indirect Object forms that have been retained.","[154, 155]"

                         There are examples where the structural pattern of prohibitives is
                  sometimes found to express inability without necessarily the implication of
                  prohibition from some external source. As in English and many other
                  languages, the distinction between these different senses of the deontic
                  mode is not encoded morphologically.                            6-84   ngayi wa-mirrisyarra-ngi

"         As noted for the postural classification of main auxiliaries, although
the serialised ‘sit' auxiliary can function literally to denote a sitting postural
orientation, especially when contrasted with ‘lie/stand’, in general it is the
unmarked choice for imperfective actions performed within a single
location. Thus examples 3-241 and 3-242 above can be said to be highly
marked with respect to posture. The non-literal posturally unmarked usage
of 'sit' results in its serialisation on verbs that are not necessarily performed
in a sitting posture.         This is evident in the example below, uttered by a
woman standing over a boiling billy.

 19There is one exception to this general statement that we have already encountered in
 example 2-40. Within the auxiliary verb, syllable-final -rr-, denoting non-singular subject
 number, assimilates to the the manner of auxiliary-root-initial -d-, e.g. nguddeny-fel ‘we (pl
ex) jumped’. This morphophonological rule is discussed in more detail in 2.4.2. Otherwise
 voice stops do not occur in syllable-final position.

  In 2.3.2 we noted that 63% of all words are vowel final. From the
remaining 37% of consonant final words we can make the following
observations. The apical trill at 12.6%, and the apical nasal /n/ at 8.3%
account for over half of all word-final consonants. The pattern suggested by
these figures, that word finally non-peripherals are more common than
peripherals, is not borne out by the stops. The dorsal /k/ is the most
frequent final stop (3.6%), followed by the non-peripherals /t/ (2.3%) and
/ty/ (1.3%) Bilabial /p/, the least frequent (0.6%), appears finally in
nominals, only in the C2C3 cluster /rrp/, eg: ngurrp ‘emu’ and ferrp ‘often’,
and in a couple of verb roots, eg: wap 'sit', pap ‘climb’ etc, which in the
absence of verbal enclitics, can be word final.
        The continuant /r/ has only been recorded word finally in a single
Ngan'gikurunggurr word, and three Ngan'giwumirri words, adigar (W/K)
‘Australian pratincole', amugar (W) ‘bony bream' and awugur (W) ‘small
fish sp. used for livebait'. However it is found more commonly syllable
finally on a number of bound prefixes wur- ‘female’, ngur- ‘penis’ etc.
        The labiodorsal semivowel /w/ has only been recorded finally in a
single word, the exclamation (ka)kaw ‘come here!’. The possible elision of
a final vowel, or some other form of phonological aberration, would not be
particularly unexpected in a member of the imperative/ejaculatory
wordclass, however in this instance its occurrence is contrastive with a
vowel final word.      2-53         kaw                 come here!
                   kawu                dyadic kin term MM/DD       The occurrence of final /y/ needs to be established to account for word
final diphthongisation of /u/ and /a/.      2-54         wakay               finished     [wakat]
                   damuy               eye          [damot]}
The failure of /y/ to occur finally after front vowels prompts an alternative
analysis of the above forms as elisions of eg: /wakayi/ and /damuyi/.
However a wider examination of the lexicon shows that not all -ayi- and
uyi- sequences follow this pattern.          2-55         ngayi                I              [natji]
                       awuyi                possum         {awaji]
On the basis of this data, I interpret word final diphthongs as a sequence of
vowel + semivowel.         Semivowels are thus included in the list of
consonants appearing word finally though, as in many Australian
languages, their distribution is restricted to following back vowels only.","[98, 99, 100]"
"          Secondly, the compounding of nominal roots, and the attachment of
enclitics to nominal roots, can potentially result in the ordering of
contiguous vowels. Such occurrences are rare within noun phrases and
impossible within the verbal complex because Ngan’gityemerri morphology
is generally constructed of CV(C) syllables. Wherever two nominal roots
forming a single phonological word, be it through compounding (as in 2-79
    a
a) or encliticisation (as in 2-79 b), end and begin with i and a respectively,
then i is deleted. Consider the examples below.

Given the limited distribution of morpheme-initial vowels in
Negan'gityemerri, note that ita is the only possible ordering of contiguous
vowels within a single phonological word.2.4.3.2      rV Deletion
         An examination of the Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr
auxiliary verb paradigms (see appendices A and B), shows evidence of a
general aversion to the occurrence in contiguous syllables of the apical stop
/d/ and continuant /r/. Where these are ordered in consecutive syllables,
the syllable containing the continuant will be deleted. e.g. -dVrV- — -dV-.

        The contrast in Ngan'gityemerri is based on glottal timing, and can be
 characterised phonetically as a contrast between voiced and voiceless stops.
        The uncharacteristically short duration of medial /d/ (that would
 make possible a contrast between medial apical stops in terms of
 constriction duration) results from the frequent realisation of /d/ as either a
 tap or approximant. Within the parameters of a voiced/voiceless analysis,
 these instances of shortened or incomplete articulatory closure are quite
 explicable as an active mechanism intended to facilitate the continuation of
 glottal pulsing.    We have already noted that another mechanism (the

"       The postural classification provided by the stative auxiliaries in their
complex function is consistent with the comments made about their simple
function in 4.2.1. ‘Sit’, ‘lie’, 'stand' and ‘hang’ all overtly describe the
subject's specific posture, though as is the case in the serialised and
existential functions of the simple intransitives, ‘sit’ is generally the
unmarked choice for the stative auxiliaries in complex function, having a
primarily aspectual, rather than posture classifying, role.
       Not all the CVSs in this second unmarked set necessarily have a
durative aspectual nature. Some, like -kilik/-kuluk(K) -'cough’, are
inherently punctual and must be marked as iterative, through verbroot
reduplication, to be amenable to imperfective interpretation.      4-98   ngini     -kikilik-tye
             Isg Sit   - cough -Past
             SU Pimp redup
             I was coughing.
The combination of unreduplicated          punctual CVSs    of this group with
stative auxiliaries is not a favoured construction.   It is however possible and
results in a semelfactive reading         (ie. one instance only of something
typically iterative).      4-99   ngiriny-kilik

                                     Abstract           This thesis is a study of Ngan'gityemerri, a language spoken
  primarily in and around the two communities of Nauiyu Nambiyu and
  Peppimenarti in the Northern Territory.
           Chapter One provides an introduction to the names by which
  speakers of this language have been referred to, comments on the
  relationship between the two dialects, and establishes my use of the term
  Ngan'gityemerri as a language name. Also included in this chapter is a brief
  account of the history of these people since European invasion of their
  country began late last century, some comments on social organisation,
  cultural affiliations, Wangga and Lirrga songstyles, and a description of their
  country. The current status of the language is reviewed, and the language
  variety presented in this work is clearly identified. A survey of previous
  work on Ngan'gityemerri, and a description of my fieldwork methodology
  are additionally included.
           Chapter Two presents the segmental phonology, phonotactics, stress
  patterns and morphophonological processes. Particular attention, in the
  form of a detailed acoustic study, is given to the mechanism by which the
  contrast between two series of stops is maintained.
           Chapter Three presents an overview of ‘simple’ and 'complex' verb
  structures, then identifies the morphological make-up of the verbal
_elements labelled ‘auxiliary’ and ‘complex verb stem’. The mechanisms
  that interact to mark categories of tense, aspect and mood, namely auxiliary
 root inflection, verbal enclitics, verb root reduplication and the serialisation
 of posture/motion auxiliaries, are all addressed in this chapter. The
 incorporation into the verb of bodypart noun roots is also investigated here.
 A distinction between ‘lexical’ and ‘syntactic’ incorporation is invoked, and
 the differences in the effect of both these types of incorporation is dealt with.
 A list of incorporable terms is presented, and their literal and classificatory
 semantics explored.
          Chapter Four investigates the semantic contribution that the
 auxiliary makes to the meaning of a full verb. The 31 auxiliaries are broken
 down into six groups on the basis of their functional roles, which are
 described in detail.
          Chapter Five deals with the role played by both freeform and bound
 generics in classifying the Ngan'gityemerri nominal world. The
 morphology of these generics is surveyed with regard to the typological
 distinction drawn between ‘noun class’ systems on the one hand, and
‘classifier’ systems on the other. The semantics of noun class categories are
also examined here.
          Chapter Six examines the set of enclitics, some of which have scope
over NPs and others over clausal propositions. The semantic functions of
this clitic set vary widely, some marking such case-like roles as 'agent' or
‘instrument’, others encoding the kinds of meanings, like speaker attitude,
that are commonly attributed to free particles. The class of free particles is
treated in Chapter Seven.
          Chapter Eight provides a brief presentation of space, time and
number expression, and Chapter Nine deals with the freeform pronominal
system, demonstratives and interrogatives.
          Appendices to this grammar include the full subject-auxiliary
sequence paradigms for both Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr, as
well as four texts. Cassette tapes of the textual material included in the
appendices have been submitted with this thesis, and copies of these will
gladly be made available by the author to any interested readers.
                            Acknowledgments          Acknowledgments in theses tend to list personal debts after
 professional ones.     I'd like to make one of my personal debts most
 prominent, for the reason that neither language informants enduring
 laborious and uninsightful elicitation, nor supervisors plowing through
 copious draft chapters, make the personal sacrifice towards a Ph.D that one's
spouse does. Janet Douglas not only endured for four years the stresses
imposed by living below the poverty line, my prolonged absences on
fieldwork, and my preoccupation with topics beyond her own interests, but
at the same time bore our two children and developed her own art. She
skillfully trod the fine line between being totally supportive on the one
hand, and ensuring, on the other, that I understood that this had to finish. I
couldn't have done this without her.
         I'd like to express my gratitude to all the inhabitants of the
communities of Peppimenarti, Nauiyu Nambiyu and Wudi Gapil Diyerr for
the friendship and generosity they extended to me, for their tolerance of my
preoccupations and blunders, and for sharing with me their language and
way of life. To teach me NgW I have been particularly fortunate in being
commandeered by Robert Daly. Delighted to find a whitefella interested in
his language, he spent twelve months befriending me, teaching me, and
getting us both into trouble. As a gifted narrator, an enthusiastic and
perceptive polyglot, and a man with an extraordinary memory, he proved to
be an excellent teacher. He provided encouragement when needed, though
delighted in publicly chiding his ‘schoolboy’ , as he liked to call me. Widely
acknowledged as a superb didjeridu player, and master of a wide range of
song styles, he opened my eyes to the whole field of song language and
structure that my linguistic training had not prepared me to even consider
as ‘language’.
         Numerous other people at Peppimenarti have contributed towards
my understanding of Ngan'gityemerri, and been great friends. Special
thanks to Agala, Tyemeny, Tyarambu, Lunggu, Talungga, Wirigaty,
Maguraty, and Terry Sams.
         Molly Mafulenggit of Nauiyu Nambiyu checked my NgW data and
provided texts and data of her own, particularly with regard to zoological
and botanical taxonomy.
         Daisybell Malfiyin and Long Harry Barney also taught me some
NgW and confirmed the Laves' data as the Ngan'gimerri of rak-Merren.
Long Harry recorded for me his entire song repertoire.
           Patrick Tyabada provided some entertaining NgW texts, and was
 invaluable in site mapping rak-Lafuganying. And thanks to Old Tilmarr
 who gave me his sweat.
           My NgkK teachers were initially the late Topsy Parry, the late Mabel
 Kada, and Margaret Parry of Nawiyu Nambiyu and Wudi Gapil Diyerr.
 Later they included Martin Padu, Pincher McCann, Paul Tyekpity and
 Stephen Kundu of Peppimenarti, and Topsy Waya of Nauiyu Nambiyu.
           Harry Wilson, king of Peppimenarti, doubled the productiveness of
 my time there by ensuring that I never experienced the sense of security that
 might lead one to slacken off. At the same time he was generous with
accommodation      and supportive of my work. To him and Regina I'm very
 grateful.
           My entire time in the field was spent under the ‘parental’ guidance
 of Bill Parry, who always kept an eye out for me, introduced me to potential
 informants, kept me informed of local political developments, and was
 always ready with a cup of tea and a dirty story.
           At Daly River Mission Joseph Parry, Dianne Tchumut and
 Angganmerr have been terrific friends, and the Nauiyu Nambiyu council
 and mission staff have always been most kind to me, providing
 accommodation and other support when neccesary. At Peppimenarti the
 successive headmasters David Shute and Tony Crichton were always
 enthusiastic about my work and encouraged me to spend time teaching in
 the school. Other European staff at Peppi, Sue Crichton, Michelle Spencer,
 Kim   O'Donnell,   Kerry   Green,   Angelita   Martini,   and   Ruth   and   Glenn
 Rogers, provided an entertaining alternative social life, numerous
 kindnesses, and some fabulous meals. Visits to Peppi by Alan Marett during
 my 1988 fieldtrip first got me interested in the structure and language of
 song, and I enjoyed our joint investigations into these topics immensely.
          My interest in Australian linguistics was first fired by Bob Dixon, and
 as my main supervisor he was thorough and always encouraging. Harold
 Koch provided additional supervision, particularly with the final draft. I'm
 greatly indebted to Ian Green. He not only provided me with the
 opportunity to first engage in fieldwork, but discussions with him over the
 subsequent years and his detailed comments of early drafts, have
 significantly shaped my analysis of Ngan'gityemerri. Mark Harvey has
 proved to be a thorough commentator, and made numerous suggestions for
 improvements, particularly in the phonology chapter and the section on
 bodyparts. For additional comments on various parts of this grammar I'm
 grateful to Felix Ameka, Andy Butcher, Anne Dineen, Nick Evans, Phil
Rose, David Wilkins and particularly to Nick Piper who did the last minute
typo hunt.
        Alison Hoddinott and Frances Kofod graciously allowed me access to
the Hoddinott and Kofod grammar whilst it was still in preparation for
publication.
        In Canberra Ian Green, Nick Piper, Felix Ameka and Andy Butcher
forced me to drink four years of bad coffee, but also kept me sane. Thanks.
       Numerous    other friends   including   Pete   & Jay, Bill & Paul,    and
especially Alison & Dave, have been unstinting in their support.
         Fieldwork funding was provided by the ANU Faculties. The
AIATSIS kindly provided me with a vehicle for the '86 fieldtrip. When I
ungraciously wrote this off, Warwick Dix was extremely helpful in finding a
replacement vehicle for me.      For my '88 fieldtrip the AIATSIS again
provided funds which enabled me to hire a vehicle from NARU                 (who
additionaliy helped out with camping equipment).

"Note however, that for those intransitive verbs that allow the cross-
referencing of goals or targets with IO pronouns (like the verbs of cognition
and perception noted in 3.2.3.1), the alternative of cross-referencing those
goals or targets with implicated pronominals is an available option.      3-107 a)      —yerrimbin-tyety -wudde

"       As is suggested by the ‘simple’ function of the auxiliary in 4-2 a)
above, and as is equally true of complex auxiliaries, the Ngan'gityemerri
auxiliary has a specific semantic component which it contributes to the
overall meaning of the verb. In this respect the Ngan'gityemerri auxiliary,
indeed the auxiliary in most if not all the Daly languages, differs from the
semantically empty verbal unit sometimes described as an ‘auxiliary’ in
other Australian languages, that merely plays host to bound pronominal
and tense morphemes!. It is this semantic character of the auxiliary that is
1In 3.2 we examined the four-part structure of the auxiliary, noting the problems in
segmentation that arose, particularly at the juncture between the bound subject pronoun and
the auxiliary root. There we concluded that treating the whole ‘bound subject + auxiliary
root' as a minimal contrastive unit was more felicitous for synchronic analysis. Likewise
to be examined in this section. I have adopted the practice of allocating each
auxiliary a name; e.g. ‘sit’, ‘see’, ‘poke’ etc, throughout the discussion and
employ these names in the example glosses in preference to simply
allocating each awdliary a number.
       In terms of formal contrastive paradigms I can identify 31 auxiliary
verbs in contemporary Ngan'gityemerri?, distinguishable on the basis of
unique subject-AVR (auxiliary verb root) sequences. The paradigms of these
sequences have been listed in appendices A and B, and readers will find
reference to these useful in following this section. Not all auxiliary subject-
AVR sequences are unique across the full person/number/tense paradigm.
A number of auxiliaries partially overlap in sharing some identical subject-
AVR sequences, though no auxiliaries show full convergence of form. For
instance, 'mouth' and ‘mouth Dtr (detransitive)' share irrealis dual
exclusive, and past imperfective non-singular exclusive forms, and the ‘sit'
present plural exclusive forms are identical with both the ‘stand’ irrealis
singular forms and the ‘shoveDt (stative)' present plural exclusive forms.
In addition there are several auxiliaries that appear to lack any obvious
semantic connection with each other, but are formally quite similar. ‘Sit’
and 'mouthDt' for instance, differ primarily in the final vowel, 'sit' having
/i/ and 'mouthDtr' having /e/.          'Hands' and ‘poke’, are likewise primarily
differentiated by a single vowel. These are a few examples only; further
similarities and correspondences will be evident from examination of the
appendices.
       All of these 31 auxiliaries combine with verb stems to form complex
verbs. 10 of the 31 are ‘simple auxiliaries’, that is, in addition to their verb
stem combination, they can stand independently, without a verb stem,
functioning as a simple verb.         The remaining 21 auxiliaries can not stand
independently and obligatorily require the presence of a verb stem. These
21 are referred to as ‘complex auxiliaries'. It should be understood then thatthroughout this section, and in the auxiliary paradigms given in appendices A and B,
auxiliaries are discussed in terms of ‘bound subject + auxiliary root’ sequences.","[242, 243]"

 constriction duration ratio for both /b/ (105ms) and /p/ (160ms), and /g/
 (75ms) and /k/ (115ms), is close to 1: 1.5. For the apical stops (/d/ - 55ms and
  /t/ - 140ms) this ratio is much greater!9 at 1:2.5. Setting aside the apicals for 10Butcher(1989b:23)notes the greater constriction duration ratio of apical /t/ and /d/ in my
 measurements,                                         and suggests that this may result from a higher frequency of flapped
  realisations of /d/ in my data. I agree - these flapped tokens of /d/(see adamuy spectrogram
  1, p 61) have probably lowered the mean duration value given for /d/ in Table 2, and should
  at least partially account for the significant difference between the mean durations of medial
  /d/(55ms) and /b/(105ms). This is the only real discrepancy between Butcher's measurements
  and mine, though my measurements for all obstruents except /t/ are generally between 5%-
  10% less than Butcher's measurements. Given that I have essentially employed the same
  Measurement criteria as he, both these factors (the higher incidence of flapped /d/ and the
  overall shorter duration values for most obstruents) probably reflect differences in our data
  bases. Although we both collected citation forms from the same speaker (Robert Daly),
  recordings were made on different occasions, and Robert may have simply varied his delivery
  speed between these sessions, for a variety of reasons. However despite minor differences
  between our respective duration values for Ngan'giwumirri obstruents, note that Butcher's
  study and my own generally concur in terms of both the duration ratios for stops at the one
  place of articulation, and also in the significance of the timing of glottal gestures in the
  maintenance of the contrast.

  either /p/ or /t/13. Initial /g/ is always realised as a fricative and varies
  freely in the activity of the glottis.      Most tokens of initial /g/ are
  modal values for the stop categories in these languages, -100ms, +10ms and +75ms. They found
  that in no language which had a contrast between two sets of stops, were the locations of the
  two sets of stops at opposite ends of the voice onset time scale. That is, the contrast was
  always lead(-100) vs smail lag(+10), or small lag(+10) vs big lag(+75), never lead(-100) vs
  big lag(+75). Lisker and Abramson additionally found that three-stop-category languages,
  like Armenian and Thai, also had these categories distributed over ranges centering on -100,
  +10 and +75 ms. Noting that the variation in boundaries between categories along the VOT
  continuum is far from random, they speak of ""three general phonetic types from which the
  categories of a particular language are selected"", and suggest that VOT may be a ""predictable
  consequence of differences in the relative timing of events at the glottis and at the place of
  oral occlusion""(1967:402). The VOT mechanism in Ngan'giwumirri clearly differs from the
  languages they studied in having clear lead(-40) vs lag(+35) modal values for initial
  bilabial and apical stops. Note though that the Ngan'giwumirri lead and lag values are
  mid-range, i.e. the lead value (-40) is a little less than half that reported by Lisker and
  Abramson (-100), and the NgW                     lag value (+35) lies between their small (+10) and big (+75)
. lag values.                 In this respect the NgW        data accords with their observation that ""in the
  Phonetic realisation of phonemic contrasts human beings fall considerably short of utilising
  all the phonetic space available to them (1964:407).
  13This is, of course, is not unexpected; VOT is generally sensitive to place of articulation and
  it has been observed by Lisker and Abramson (1964:399) that velars have notably longer VOT
  initially.

"2.3.3.2         Consonant Clusters
          The discussion below deals with three types of consonant cluster.
                 1) Syllable final diconsonant clusters:   C2C3
                 2) Inter-syllabic diconsonant clusters. We further break this
                    section down, comparing those clusters which can only
                    occur intramorphemically, with those which can occur
                   across morpheme boundaries (marked by +): C3C4 and
                   C3+Cy
                 3) Triconsonant clusters: C2C3+C4

          C2 can only be one of the liquids, usually the trill /rr/.         I have
recorded only one example of the lateral /1/ and two of the continuant /r/.
       C3 can only be of the voiceless peripheral stops /p/ or /k/, or the
dorsal nasal /ng/.

       Syllable final preconsonantal C3 can be any voiceless stop, nasal or
liquid. Syllable initial postconsonantal C4 can be any stop, any nasal, the
peripheral fricatives /f/ and /g/, and either semivowel. These are only
general statements of distribution, not all conceivable combinations being
attested. Three more precise statements of the types of cluster found
intramorphemically are set out below.

              The only heterorganic nasal/stop clusters to occur
       intramorphemically are the apical /n/ followed by a
       peripheral stop.               2-59          - kanbi                   bamboo, didjeridu

       morphemes. The single heterorganic cluster that occurs

20The contrast in Ngan'gityemerri between apical nasal n and laminal nasal ny is neutralised
in intramorphemic nasal stop clusters with the laminal stop ty. In the practical orthography
used here, this cluster is represented as -nty- not -nyty-, although the nasal is phonetically
realised as laminal [p).
              The continuant /r/ has only been recorded in intramorphemic
              clusters with the dorsal obstruents, i.e. /r+g/ and /r+k/.              2-64       midixgurr -         nut sp.
                         ngirkik     -       breathlessness      From these three statements we can observe that C3 cannot be a
fricative, a semivowel or a voiced stop. C4 cannot be a liquid, the laminal
fricative /sy/, or a voiced stop, except postnasally - a position in which,
morpheme-medially, the stop contrast is neutralised. We can also perceive
the significance of the feature ‘tperipheral’.

      We can now address the C3C, clusters that occur across morpheme
boundaries.     As an essentially agglutinating language, Ngan'gityemerri
displays widespread compounding, full and partial root reduplication, and
extensive affixation and cliticisation.   A far greater range of clusters is
produced   by these morphological processes than those selective few
exploited intra-morphemically.
        Now, with one extension and one minor exception, any C3 can be
followed by any Cy, ie: any word final consonant can be followed by one
which can occur initially. The extension is that the continuant /r/ which
has an extremely rare final occurrence, can now be followed by any Ci
consonant. The one exception is that no voiced stop or fricative can follow
a voiceless stop.    This is merely a theoretical constraint though,      as
Ngan'gityemerri morphemes are so structured that such impermissible
clusters are not produced (ie: no morpheme ends in a voiced stop, no suffix
begins with a voiced stop, no prefixes end in a voiceless stop).","[100, 101, 102, 103, 104]"
"       The 'Heat' auxiliary stands apart from all the other instrumental
auxiliaries in showing a split between the marking of the roles of heat-as-
instrument and heat-as-agent.         For verbs involving higher animate
controlled instrumental use of heat, there exists the normal full paradigm
of ‘Heat’ subject-auxiliary sequences. However, verbs involving the more
autonomous heating processes effected through the non-controlled
combustion of fire and the sun, are marked by a distinct set of subject-AVR
sequences. These latter sequences are obviously restricted to 3rd person
singular forms. In purely paradigmatic terms, rather than treat this as two
separate auxiliaries, one of which consists simply of 3sg forms, I have
chosen to view this phenomenon as a single auxiliary with a formal split
among the 3sg forms between ‘higher animate controlling agents’ and ‘heat
as agent’. The full ‘heat' subject-auxiliary paradigm showing this split, can
be found in appendices A and B.
       3rd singular higher animate controlled instumental heat use is
contrasted with heat-as-agent in the examples below.

        It is also apparent from Table 3-3 that there is currently complete
neutralisation of the Direct Object and Indirect Object non-singular
pronouns. Evidence from the Ngan'gimerri data collected by Gerhardt
Laves in about 1930 suggests that the current paradigm results from the
collapse of an earlier system where the contrast between Direct and Indirect
Object bound pronouns was additionally made in the ist exclusive, 2nd and
3rd person dual forms. From Laves' work we can reconstruct the following
forms for Ngan'‘gimerri, a now extinct dialect of Ngan'gityemerri.",[154]
