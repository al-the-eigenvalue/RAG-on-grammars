"2.1.1.2. Person-number agreement
From the point of view of a formal as well as explanatory description the person-
number conjugation of Alutor verbs is a very complicated matter. In question is not
just the abundance of agreement forms (the full paradigm of the finite verb has 496     54
        The non-transparent marker na-/nan-/yn- ‘LOW.A’ occupies the prefix slot with rank
-4, see 2.1.1.2.4, and the marker -tki ‘2nsg.A+3.P’ occupies the suffix slot with rank +4, see
2.1.1.2.3.",[42]
"3.0. Basic notions
In this study of Alutor syntax we do not use such t r a d i t i o n a l syntactic notions as
subject and object since, in our opinion, their common usage is not congruent with
the internal structure of Alutor and would merely lead to misunderstanding. In this
case it is more advisable to use more neutral notions based on a framework of core
arguments constituting the base of clause syntactic structure (for the grounds of the
opposition “core vs. peripheral arguments” see [Kibrik 1998]).
        There is a restricted number of core arguments in a clause. If there is only one
core argument in a clause 116 , the clause (as well as its predicate) is i n t r a n s i t i v e .
This argument is called the S - a r g u m e n t (Sole) irrespective of its semantic role. If
there are two core arguments in a clause, the clause (as well as its predicate) is
t r a n s i t i v e . A transitive clause has an agent-like A - a r g u m e n t (Agentive) and a
patient-like P- a r g u m e n t (Patientive).
        In our case, this terminology is preferable because it does not ascribe a
particular syntactic pattern to Alutor clause structure, keeping this fundamental
question open for further investigation, as there is not yet enough data to resolve this
problem.",[110]
"      Forms in the 1pl actor conjunctive are translated as “If we could do P”:

     In this case the wish component of the meaning is forgrounded. Sometimes the
conjunctive means the availability of potential resources to accomplish event P:(44)      tOk,          agi      myt-teNan-myk                          jaqqy·s@am

      Examples of the 3rd person conjunctive are rare in our collection of texts. In the
following sentence an irreal event looking like a real one is talked about:(46)       tu         ynNa         Nany.k          asgi.kina.k        qonpy.N      aNaNta-n

     The conjunctive as well as the optative is used in purpose clauses with the
conjunction qinaq ‘in order that/to’:

The infinitive forms sentential complements of phasal verbs (with typical meanings
‘begin’ 94 , ‘continue’, ‘finish’). Phasal verbs inherit the transitivity / intransitivity
properties of subordinate verbs marked as the infinitive. In the context of an
intransitive embedded verb the main verb has an intransitive agreement pattern and
agrees with a noun marked with the nominative:(50) a. ...myty-lJgi=tgilivy-lqiv-la(-myk)                              tanJNy.sity-k!

     c. ...inJas        q-il-la-tyk                          valatkyla-k...

          ...Well, that's enough. Stop running (after me)... [8:59]
       However, in the context of a transitive embedded verb the main verb gets a
transitive agreement pattern:
     94
       Statistically the overwhelming number of infinitive textual occurences are governed by the
verb ‘begin’.","[77, 78, 79, 80]"
"3.6. Clausal coordination
Clausal coordination is not accompanied by any strict rules of coreferential NP
marking. Practically all strategies (repetition of full nominations, replacement of full
nomination by a pronoun or its deletion) are realized. Let us consider these strategies.
     1) In both clauses full NPs are present without reduction:(59)     ...ga-meNy-teNal-lin                           unJunJu              to
          RES-big-lay.up.dried.fish-RES+3sg.S           child+NOM+SG         and
         naqat            unJunJu        ...     ylla@y-N         iv-i

         ...the son prepared a lot of fish (for winter) and on purpose [the son], well, how to say,
         said to (his) mother... [9:2]
       2) Pronominalization of one of the NPs:(60)     qutkinJnJaqu-nak            ly@u-ni-nat               unJunJu-t            to
         Qutkinnaqu-ERG+SG           see-3sg.A+3P-3du.P           child-NOM+DU           and

         RES-peep(-RES+3sg.S)          sleeping.tent-REL+3sg
         A man woke up in the yurt and peeped from the sleeping tent... [18:7]    b. ynykka-teny-N              tyla-la-t,                     ten,

         (They) came to him and suddenly [=well] they all died. [8:24]
In (61a) the second NP is deleted (anaphoric reduction), while in (61b) the first one is
deleted (cataphoric reduction).
      In case of pronominalization or deletion a specific situation can arise if the
clause holding the controlling NP is transitive: what argument of the clause controls
pronominalization/deletion of the reduced NP in the other clause? Statistically the A-
argument prevails, however it is far from being an obligatory rule:(62) a. pila-lqiv-ni-n,                      ten         viH-i            ynN.in.

         And at once the stranger killed the younger brother with the spear, and he {the brother}
         there and then died. [20:44]     In (62a) pronominalization, and in (62b) deletion is used. In both cases the P-
argument of the first clause is the controller of these processes.                                  Comment: process or
                                                                                                    processes ?
     Even the possessor can control reduction:

          And (he) cut [=took away] his lip and (he) did not move at all. [20:40]      In discourse, overt antecedents are often absent, and coreference is resolved
through pragmatic means without the use of any grammatical means:(64)      na-qamitva-tky-n,                    na-n.awyj.aty-tky-n,

          They gave him dinner (and) fed him. Feeling thirsty, he stopped eating. [4:20]
3.7. Reflexivization
In Alutor argument reflexivization (affecting the argument position) is expressed with
the help of the reflexive pronoun uvik ‘oneself’ (lit. ‘body’), and possessive
reflexivization (affecting the possessive position) uses the pronoun sininkin/sinin
‘one's own’ (the second variant is used in case of incorporation).
      The question of control of reflexivization is of special interest. According to the
field report by F.A.Antsiferov (1978), the A/S-argument is the controller of
reflexivization:(65) a. vasq.in=meNy=kuka-ta                uvik                   g-epy-lin

is the A-argument marked with the ergative, because in the context of incorporation
of the P-argument ‘nose’ its possessor is raised into the opened P-position. In (65c) S-
argument controls reflexivization of the dative argument.
      Possessive reflexivization allows the A- and P-controllers:(66)          tumgy-nak          jyvykly-ni-n            ylygyn

2.1.7. The values of some verbal categories
2.1.7.1. Indicative
The indicative refers to the events belonging to the real world, i.e. events that took or
are taking place. Temporal deixis of respective forms is secondary. The perfective
usually describes events that took place before the speech act, see (27a). The
imperfective is neutral to the temporal axis. It can be used for events proceeding
during the speech act as well as prolonged incompleted events before the speech act,
see (27b):(27) a. wutt.in         itt-i             ynkyjap,        nJy.mqy.saN.ki.
          this+3sg      be-3sg.S+PF       long.ago        in.one's.childhood
          This occurred long ago in (my) childhood. [37:1]       b. naqamx@at         tyHyly-tkyn      pyttuNy-l@y-n.

          this) Nemelen had numerous herds. (And) he was sick all the time. {RC: After that it
          already began to snow} [29:8-10]
      The imperfective also describes prolonged events that continuously take place
or are repeated. Thus, texts 25-28, describing traditional customs, abound in
indicative imperfective forms, for example:(28)      jaqi       myty-lHita-lqivy-tkyn,               varanJ-nJaq
          later      1nsg.S-hold.a.race-LQIV-IPF          people-AUGM+NOM+SG
          igu-tkyn          Hita-l@y-N.
          gather-IPF        hold.a.race-ATR-DAT
          Well, we hold a race. People gather at the place of the race. [25:1]
       Repeated action can refer to the past:
                                                  71
(29)     Nynvys.saN        gymmy           ty-walqivy-lqivy-k                to         numal

         LOW.A-carry-IPF-1sg.P          school-DAT
         I had run away many times (before), but every time [=again] I was returned to school.
         [37:5]
      In (29) both actions are repeated, however the first verb (‘run away’) has
perfective marking, and the second one (‘carry’) — imperfective marking. This is
because the first action is punctual and the second is prolonged.
      In analytical negative forms relating to the temporal domain of the definite
future the auxiliary verb can have imperfective marking:(30) ...ally      a-pilg.at-ka             il-la-tkyni-tyk.
       not        A-get.hungry-PRED`       be-PLUR-IPF-2nsg.S
        {LC: Wait! A little later, don't hurry. Later you will eat well, you will be full and} will
        not be (left) hungry. [11:10]2.1.7.2. Potential
Potential means that the event P does not belong to the world of real events,
nevertheless P can potentially be in this world. This event does not have any
epistemic restrictions. It is quite natural that this type of event is closely related to
events that, in languages with the grammatical category of tense, pertain to future.
Therefore in most cases potential verb forms are translated as future forms:(31)     vitga           lygyrNy-n                  ga-kumn.al-lin:

         Legerngen there and then exclaimed,         e will take away this walrus (from you) .
         [22:20]2.1.7.3. Optative
The optative, like the conjunctive, pertains to moods that refer to the mental state of
the speaker. The prototypical properties of the optative are the following:
      — the speaker is thinking about a virtual event P;
                                               72
      — the speaker wants event P to be performed;
      — the speaker highly estimates the reality of the approach of the event P;
      — the speaker is talking about this.
      The speaker's capability to control the approach of event P depends on the
person of the active participant (actor) of this event.
      In the context of the 1sg actor (identical to the speaker) the optative, along with
the speaker/actor's wish for the performance of event P, refers to his intention or wish
to accomplish it:(32)      maja?         my-n.sis@aty-n.
          where         1sg.A+OPT-look-3sg.P
          {LC: Miti says that she gave birth to his child. Qutkinnaqu:} Where? I will take a look.

          1sg.A+OPT-shoulder-2sg.P
          Sit down, (that's) enough, I will carry you on (my) back. [4:9]      The usage of the 1pl optative is analogous: the optative refers to the speaker's
intention to perform an action and his address to the listener to do this together with
him:(35) a. ...myn-meNy=tkyply-la-n,                      myn-Halap-la-n.
           1nsg.A+OPT-hard=beat-PLUR-3sg.P              1nsg.A+OPT-catch.up.with-PLUR-3sg.P
          {LC: Ah, that's just him.} Let's beat him hard, let's catch him. [8:53]       b. qutkinJnJaqu,                  gemat·qi          myn-ra.mk.isi-myk
          Qutkinnaqu+NOM+SG              maybe             1nsg.S+OPT-pay.a.visit-1nsg.S+PF

                                                 73
          Qutkinnaqu, maybe we will go (and) visit (my) home. [7:24]       c. nuN-alu-sqiv-a                      myn-ity-tkyn.
          NEG-pick.berries-go-ANLT            1nsg.S+OPT-be-IPF
          We won't have to go picking berries. [7:18]
      It the context of a 3rd person S/A-argument, the optative refers to the speaker's
wish that the event in question happens to that 3rd person:(36)      qygi       taqy=trup=kiwyl                          ny-@-ity-n,
          look!      what=Teruppe=blood+NOM+SG                3.S+OPT-be-3sg.S
          ynN.in        gym.nin       HiN.valJ=kiwyl.
          this+3sg      my+3sg        nostril=blood+NOM+SG
          {LC:     hy is this blood bad? , said Miti.} You see, it would be good if this were
          Teruppe's blood, but this is blood from my nose. [10:29]
      This example convincingly testifies to the failure of an imperative interpretation
of these forms in the 3rd person. In the context of the 3rd person, the subject of the
wish does not have to coincide with the speaker.(37)      a-Neqy-ka            wut¥ku tig-uwwi                     ny-tkiv-na(-wwi).
          A-bad-PRED           here       ski-NOM+PL               3.S+OPT-spend.the.night-3pl.S
          It's bad if the skis spend the night here. [12:6]In the dialogue the speaker (the man) presupposes that the hearer (the bear) wishes
the skis had stayed home at night.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74]"
"
      Type (2) has two realizations. In combination with the negative particle ally, it
contrasts with the positive forms of the real moods. In combination with the particle
kytvy(l), it represents the prohibitive as a negative correlate of optative/imperative.(13) a. ...Hatav       gym-nan              ally        a-la@u-ka.
          only       I-ERG            not          A-see-PRED`
        {LC: Before the Japanese people appeared here long ago.} Only I didn't see (them).
        [32:3]    b. ...kytvyl             gytty            a-wintat-ka            tynJnJy=svi.sity-k...

        ... Don't you dare help saw the tusks. [16:13]
     In type (2) reduction of the negative marker is possible (the negative particle is
absent):(14) a. ...Navaq       a-jyl-ka               tyrup=tyrgy-tyr,
          if         A-give-PRED`           Teruppe=meat-NOM+SG
        na-ta-meNy=rwit-gyt.
        LOW.A-POT-big=beat.up-2sg.P
        ... if (you) won't hand over Teruppe's meat, (they) will beat you up. [10:49]    c. niNvit=tylly-k t-epyNal-la-tyk,                          a-sasiku-la-ka.
        devil=door-LOC POT-get.stuck-PLUR-2nsg.S                A-go.sledging-PLUR-PRED`
        ...you will get stuck in the evil entrance. Don't go for a ride. [14:2]
                                                   65
     Type (3) is the analytical extension of type (2) for real moods. Both full and
reduced realizations are possible.(15) a. ally         tinga     a-jyl-ka                na-nty-gym.
         not         what      A-give-PRED`            LOW.A-do-1sg.P
         They didn't give me anything. [10:32]    b. ...nura.q       a-jyl-ka                                 na-nty-gym.

         ...I hadn't been married for a long time. [32:13]      Type (4) uses a negative analytical representation of the lexical verb as a basic
structural element in combination with the optative auxiliary verb. This type is a
negative correlate of the optative. Optionally the presence of a negative particle is
possible.(16) а. kytvyl         nuNy-nm-a          myny-nty-nat.
         must.not      NEG-kill-ANLT         1nsg.A+OPT-do-3du.P

         Let's not go to look for them. [6:14]
       Type (5) is formed by means of circumfixes. First we have tymNi-...-a/-ta,
deriving the negative correlate of the supine (verbal nominal) (see 2.1.6.2 below). The
prefix part of the circumfix coincides with the root of the verb ‘be lost’ (i.e. not to
exist in the real world), the suffix part coincides with the marker of verbal analytical
representation (see the preceding type). This negative form refers to a situation whose
non-existence is a goal of the action expressed by the main clause (see 2.1.6.2).
       Second, a-…-kyl@in circumfix is used for the derivation of the negative form,
and then the negative particle ally is added. In contrast to other forms this type is a
deverbal attributive. There are grounds to interpret this form as a negative correlate of
the deverbal adjective (n-...-qin); see 2.1.2.(17) a. ...wutt.in           gyrnik                    ally     a-viHy-kyl@in ...

      Auxiliary verbs are compatible with different mood values: (10a) exemplifies
the indicative, (10b) the optative, (10c) the conjunctive, and (10d) the potential.

            [22:32]2.1.5. Negative forms
Besides the positive verb forms described above, there are negative forms. Verbal
negation can be expressed by the following means:
       (1) combination of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb;
       (2) combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative (a-...ka);
       (3) combination of the negative particle with the analytical form derived from
the deverbal predicative;
       (4) the analytical form, derived from the negative analytical representation
(nuN-...-a/-ta);
       (5) circumfixes tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in (the latter is identical to the
caritive adjective (see 2.2.2) marker. It is compatible with the negative particle).
       Now we will consider the negative forms in detail.
       Type (1) is found only for the desirable moods — optative and conjunctive. In
this case the negative (more precisely, the prohibitive) particle qytymmy 91 is used.
(i)   to       vitga         g-awwav-laN                vyly-NNy...
      and      at.once       RES-leave-RES+3pl.S        go.out.on.the.shore-ANLT
      And at once they went out on the shore... [22:28]
      91
       It is interesting to note that the negative particle qytymmy is also compatible with nouns,
cf. gymmy wiwnyN ty-t-awwavy-N, qytymmy korfa-N ‘I will arrive at Vyvenka rather than in
Korf’. However in general nouns are more often combined with the negative noun alval@in ‘not
that, another’ rather than with qytymmy, cf. gymnan ty-gita-tky-n qajunJunJu, alval@in
NavysqatpilJ ‘I look at the boy rather than at the girl.’

      The conjugation of the intransitive verb ‘jump’ and the transitive verb ‘beat’ are
presented in Appendix. The linear structure of the finite verb form is presented in
Table 1. The nucleus of the form is its verb stem. It has the zero rank. Morpheme

auxiliary depends on the (in)transitivity of the lexical verb: intransitive verbs are
combined with the auxiliary ‘be’ and transitive verbs with the auxiliary ‘do, have’.
      The analytical forms have positive as well as negative polarity. The lexical verb
inside p o s i t i v e a n a l y t i c a l f o r m s has the suffix marker -a/-ta (identical to the
ergative marker). There is also the suffix marker -N, see (9b), identical to the dative
marker. These forms are almost impossible outside of analytical verb forms; therefore
their converbal (see below) interpretation is not desirable 88 . We will refer to them as
the analytical form of the lexical verb 89 (glossed as ANLT).
      The following are examples with intransitive verb:(9) a. tury-pkir-a                      g-il-laNina,

       88
       There are two textual examples contradicting this interpretation that deserve a special
mention:(i)     kyrgy=nJu-ta               mimly-k        na-ntu-tky-nawwi.

        {LC: We make soup,} or after eating them directly (we) begin to wash them down...
        [33:31]      -a/-ta form, according translation, is used here as a converb, however in both cases the
subordinate as well as main verbs are the same: ‘eat’ and ‘wash down’. There is an assumption
that in this case the -a/-ta form is not a free one, but it is a part of idiomatic expression signifying
‘to eat and drink simultaneously’.

        The desiderative marker occupies a position inside the verb stem, therefore it can co-occur
with the potential marker (cf. (iv) with (ii-iii)):     (i)           ralqivy-tkyn ‘He enters’

     It is also used for the formation of the analytical negative (see 2.1.4).
     The imperative is formed by means of the circumfix ga-...-a/-ta 86 . Imperative
forms do not have the aspectual values, and lack regular personal markers 87 .
Nevertheless the imperative has restricted inflectional devices. First, it has number
agreement with a 1-2nd person argument identical to that of the polypersonal
conjugation (the marker -la, see 2.1.1.2.5). Second, it has 1sg P-argument agreement
by means of the inversion marker -ina, see 2.1.1.2.3. For example:(7) a. ...g-awwav-a                    rara-N ...
            IMPR-leave-IMPR            house-DAT

           ... from now on kill reindeer for me. [20:97]
      As (7b) shows, the imperative is compatible with incorporation.
      There are also analytical imperative forms containing the lexical verb with the
predicative marker a-...-ka and the auxiliary marked as imperative:(8)    am-oji-ka         g-ity-lqiv-a.
       A-lip-CARIT       IMPR-be-LQIV-IMPR
       Shut up [=be silent]. [20:68]2.1.4. Analytical verb forms
Besides the synthetic verb forms described above analytical forms are also possible.
They include a lexical verb and an auxiliary as the bearer of verbal inflectional
categories. There are the auxiliary verbs it- ‘be’ and t/n.t- ‘do, have’. The choice of
      86
         Variant -ta occurs after final full vowel stems, and variant -a — after final consonant or
final y stem.
      87
         It is natural to suppose that the prefix and suffix parts of the imperative marker occupy the
personal S/A/P-slots of verb form (ranks -4 and +4). It is also possible to regard the imperative as
derived from umnarked perfective stem.","[59, 60, 61]"
"1.3.7. Vowel Reduction
Alutor demonstrates quantitative and qualitative vowel reduction in pre-stressed and
post-stressed positions.
       In pre-stressed position only the vowel a is reduced; the alternation a/y takes
place in some monosyllabic prefixes ending in a, and more rarely − in some roots 42 .
       The qualitative reduction follows the rule:
       in an open pre-stressed syllable a vowel a is reduced immediately before H and
appears as y (provided it is not the prefix a), i.e.
(13) a ⇒ y / _HVstressed and a ≠ Pref a
       Examples: gyHônqavlin (< {ga-Hanqa-v-lin}) ‘(s)he stopped’, cf. @a-Hônqav-
ka ‘(s)he did not stop’; tyHírsaN (< {taHyr-saN}) ‘how many times’, cf. tôHyr ‘how
many’, jyHølgyn (< {jaHilg-n}) ‘moon’, cf. nyjôHisgyqin ‘moonlit’.
       Quantitative reduction is typical of long vowels and occurs in post-stressed     41
         It would be natural to expect the coalescence uw => U, but it is unattested in Alutor (the
combination uw occurs only before w).
      42
         This rule may have some reference to the irregular distribution of alternates ô and y found
in the root {la@u / ly@u / s@u} ‘to see’, cf. ty-lô@u-tkyn ‘I see him/it’, but ly@ã-kki ‘to see’, @inJô-
s@u-k ‘to seek’.",[28]

                              CHAPTER 1. PhonologyIn the present phonological sketch we will describe the following two main aspects of
Alutor phonology: the static aspect, that is inventories of units (segments and
suprasegmentals), and the dynamic aspect, that is phonological processes. The static
part deals with the sounds of Alutor − phones and phonemes (1.1), as well as the
syllable and rhythmic patterns (1.2). The dynamic part deals with the phonological
processes of Alutor, which are presented in the form of rewriting rules (1.3).
       The approach we use here is similar to that of generative phonology (see also
[Kodzasov, Krivnova 1981]). Two levels of representing Alutor words are
distinguished: the underlying level, that is the level of phonemes (it corresponds to
the morphophonemic level in the Russian traditional phonology) and the surface
level, that is the level of phones, or systematic phonetic level (we omit some minor
details of Alutor pronunciation, irrelevant for the phonetic system). Rewriting rules
apply to the underlying representation of a word, which is a sequence of underlying
representations of the corresponding morphemes. Underlying representations of
Alutor morphemes are given in the Dictionary – see Part III. The application of
rewriting rules results in the surface representation, or the phonetic transcription.
       In the present section the underlying representation of Alutor words and
morphemes is given in braces. Phonetic and practical transcriptions of words are
usually not parenthesized, but in some special cases the phonetic transcription is
given in square brackets. The application of rewriting rules is shown in round
brackets. The inventories of the surface and the underlying representations are
identical, that means we use one and the same chart of symbols for writing phones
and phonemes.","[1, 2]"
"2.1.1.2.3. Pure non-transparent agreement markers
Now let us consider pure n o n - t r a n s p a r e n t markers, presented in boldface in
Table 3. These markers are specific in the sense that it is difficult to ascribe to them a
single person-number value of an A/P-argument. It is easy to see that these markers
usually simultaneously take account of person-number values of both the A- and P-
arguments of transitive verbs. To be more precise, these markers are present with the
following combinations of person-number values of A- and P-arguments:      A     P          Agreement markers
      2nsg 3           -tki
      3sg 3            -ni
      3nsg 1/2/3       na-
      3sg 2            na-
      3sg/2 1nsg       na-
      3sg/2 1sg        ina-      What is a motivation of this united expression of A/P-person-number values? In
our description the interpretation of these markers is based on the Deictic Hierarchy
mentioned above (see Figure 1). In this Hierarchy the arguments' person-number
values are ordered in accordance with the principle of m a r k e d n e s s r e v e r s a l
with respect to A/P-positions. Namely, the leftmost member of the Hierarchy
                                               51
generally harmonizes with the A-role, and the rightmost member with the P-role.
Therefore the A-role is mostly unmarked for the ‘I’-argument, and the P-role for the
‘they’-argument, and vice versa, the A-role is generally marked for the ‘they’-
argument, and P-role for the ‘I’-argument. With respect to the intermediate positions
of the Deictic Hierarchy, markedness of the A-role increases in the Hierarchy from
left to right, whereas markedness of the P-role increases from right to left. The critical
point of this Hierarchy is the boundary between locutors and non-locutors. It is
normal for locutors to play the A-role 69 , whereas it is normal for non-locutors to play
the P-role. The following person-number combinations of A- and P-roles are
congruent with this tendency 70 :
       A              P
       I        — you sg/you nsg/him/them
       we       — you sg/you nsg/him/them
       you sg — him/them      It is easy to see that these combinations of deictic categories trigger the regular
(pure and combined) agreement markers. Deviations from the regular coding are
found in the context of the following person-number A- & P-combinations:      A                P
      you sg —         me/us
      you nsg —        me/us /him/them
      he      —        me/us /you sg/you nsg/him/them
      they    —        me/us /you sg/you nsg/him/them      It is exactly these combinations that trigger non-transparent agreement markers
(see boldfaced markers in Table 3). However, the various combinations of deictic
values trigger different types of non-transparent markers, thus a more precise
formulation is needed. In general the choice of non-transparent coding depends on the
values of both arguments of the transitive verb, nevertheless the starting point for the
choice is the deictic properties of one of them. In the following cases it is the A-
argument:
      (a) the most deictically unnatural, i.e. the most marked A-argument (= ‘they’) needs the non-
transparent marker (na-);
     69
        Moreover, locutor can play the P-role in case when the A-role is also occupied by locutor
outranking the former in the Deictic Hierarchy.

        English pronominal constructions are used for the sake of clarity.","[51, 52]"
"1.3.8.2. Consonant Gemination
In some rare cases the root-final obstruent t is geminated, so that the preceding
syllable becomes closed. The process is partly morphologically defined, since roots
geminating their final consonants form a restricted group of the lexicon (the
corresponding words are given in the Dictionary). Some roots ending in t do not
demonstate this alternation, cf. arôt-i ‘(s)he fell’.
      The rule regulating consonant gemination runs as follows:
      if a root is marked for gemination, its root-final obstruent t is geminated
                                           29
immediately before a word-final vowel, provided the preceding vowel is a stressed
one, i.e.
(16) t ⇒ tt / #CVstressed _-V2# and t ∈ Rgemination
       Examples: jôtti (< jôt-i < {jat-j}) ‘(s)he came’; cf. tyjôtytkyn (< {t-jat-tkyn}) ‘I
am coming’.
       Consonant gemination is obviously related to syllable addition when the
consonant is geminated too − see 1.3.8.2.","[29, 30]"

                                                       95
       The final vowel truncation is accompanied by standard phonological processes,
cf. tatul (root {tatula}) ‘fox’, but akyk (root {akka}) ‘son’, imyt (root {imti}) ‘burden’
(since consonant clusters do not occur word-finally, a schwa is inserted here − see
1.3.3).
       The inflectional ending -n is added to stems ending in either a vowel or a
consonant 104 , cf. gytga-n (< {gytga-n}) ‘late autumn’, nalgy-n (< {nalg-n}) ‘fur
skin’.
       The inflectional ending -lNyn is usually used with nouns denoting body parts
(both human and animal's), names of animals, and also with nouns denoting one
object of a pair, cf. vilu-lNyn ‘ear’, masvi-lNyn ‘animal's chest’, Higy-lNyn (< {Hig-
lNyn}) ‘wolf’, lili-lNyn ‘mitten’. After stems ending in a homorganic consonant the
inflectional ending -lNyn appears as -lyNyn (see 1.3.3.3), cf. aNar-lyNyn ‘star’.
       The inflectional ending -qal is used only with nouns denoting one object of a
pair, cf. pylak-qal (along with pylaky-lNyn) ‘fur boot’, lili-qal (along with lili-lNyn)
‘mitten’.
       The inflectional ending -Na is used with a few nouns that probably belong to
the original Alutor lexicon: ypa-Na ‘soup’, kuka-Na ‘pot’, mami-Na ‘fish drying
shed’, qura-Na ‘reindeer’, rara-Na ‘yurt, house’, ruru-Na ‘bed, sleeping place, titi-
Na ‘needle’, typa-Na ‘stone hammer’.
       Many original and some loan-words form the nominative singular by copying
(= reduplicating) the root morph. Such words belong to different semantic groups, cf.
anu-@an (< {anured}) ‘spring’, wiru-wir (< {wirured}) ‘(kind of) salmon’ (for
reduplication rules see 1.3.1).
       The ergative markers -a/-ta are distributed according to the final segment of a
stem: the variant -a is used with stems ending in a consonant or a schwa, while the
variant -ta is used with stems ending in a non-schwa vowel, cf. tyrg-a ‘meat, ERG’,
jIl-a (< {jIly-a}) ‘tongue, ERG’, , but gytka-ta ‘leg, ERG’.
       In the locative the inflectional ending -ki is characteristic of stems ending in N
(and sometimes in w), in other cases the ending -k or its phonological variant -kki are
used (the latter − after a stressed vowel), cf. lyqlaN-ki ‘winter, LOC’, rara-k ‘house,
ERG’, mimly-k ‘water, LOC’, but lylô-kki ‘eye, LOC’.
       The dative, as well as the lative (the latter can be treated historically as a double
case composed of the locative and dative items), has no variants.
       In the prolative the morph -gypyN is used with the stems ending in a single
consonant, while in other cases the morph -jpyN is used. If a stem ends in the vowel -

"1.1.1.4. Long and Short i, u, a
There is a phonological opposition of long and short vowels i/I, u/U, a/A in Alutor.
The opposition is considerably restricted by the rules of rhythmic and syllable
structure (see also 1.2). The constraints are:
       1) a long vowel may appear only in an open syllable (except in expressive
words);
       2) in a stressed open syllable (that is the first or the second syllable of a word) a
non-schwa vowel is always long;
       3) in a post-stressed syllable (of a stressed word − see 1.2.2) a non-schwa vowel
is always short.
       Long vowels are therefore to be found only in the first or second open syllable,
but since in the open stressed syllable the contrast between originally long and
originally short vowels is neutralized, long and short vowels may only contrast in the
first pre-stressed syllable. That is exactly what we found in Alutor, cf. @itítkyn
‘(s)he/it is’ vs. jIlJítkuk ‘gossip’, @upítkyn ‘(s)he is repelling’ vs. lUvítkyn ‘(s)he is
sucking’, jatítkyn ‘(s)he is coming’ vs. @AsíNti ‘two debts’. The functional
significance of this contrast is not great, because pre-stressed I, U, A occur rather
seldom, and in many words originally long vowels occur in a stressed syllable, where
the opposition is neutralized, cf. @øtyk [I] ‘be’ and jØlyjil ‘tongue’, @ãpyk [U] ‘repel’
and lÃvyk ‘suck’, jôtyk [A] ‘go’ and @ÔsyN ‘debt’ (as one can see, in the practical
transcription we mark the length in stressed syllables only on originally long vowels).
At the same time, it is obvious that the length of these vowels is relevant and should
be marked in the underlying representation of corresponding morphemes. Another
piece of evidence for the vowel length is that after an open syllable with a long vowel
there is always a syllable of the |Cy| type, cf. nypØtyqin ‘old’, HÔlyHal ‘axe’ 6 . In the
underlying representation of such morphemes we write both a long vowel and a |Cy|
     6
       Here the schwa does not break up an illicit cluster, because the corresponding cluster may
appear in another word (see 1.2.1). Such examples have reference to another phonological
constraint: a syllable with a long vowel cannot be a closed one. Thus we have nypØtyqin (while
*nypItqin is wrong), HÔlyHal (while *HAl Hal is wrong).",[6]

"1.1.2.2. Obstruents
The obstruents are subdivided into two classes: plosives and fricatives. In Alutor all
the plosives are voiceless, and all the fricatives are voiced. The Alutor fricatives have
a rather broad passageway, so they are similar to sonorants. Fricatives are represented
by only two segments − v and g. It is remarkable that while Alutor fricative obstruents
                                                   8
are not numerous, there is great variety to the sonorants. 9
       Alutor obstruents occur at all the places of articulation, except for the absence
of palatals.
       Labials are represented by the two consonants − p and v.
       Dentalveolars (both obstruents and sonorants) are represented by the dentals t,
n, l and the alveolar r. The dentals contrast in secondary articulation − palatalization;
they may be either non-palatalized or palatalized. The non-palatalized dental t does
not have a voiced fricative correlate 10 . The exact palatalized correlate of t would be tJ,
but this is not the sound we usually find in Alutor (actually, the sound tJ does occur,
but only in some Alutor words, cf. matka ~ matJka ‘interrogative particle’). The
sound we consider the palatalized correlate of t is represented mainly by two variants,
both close to the palatalized tJ, but not identical with it: the affricate tsJ and the
fricative sJ, the latter similar to a palatal fricative. The affricate occurs mainly in the
speech of the old generation, while the fricative is more widely used, it occurs in the
speech of young and middle-aged people. In papers on Alutor the fricative sound is
usually registered as s; in the present paper we also use s to write this sound in the
practical transcription. It is remarkable that the morphological alternation t/tsJ occurs
approximately in the same contexts as the alternations 1/1J, n/nJ (see 1.3.10). On
these grounds we refer to tsJ as the palatalized correlate of t. The phoneme tsJ has no
voiced counterpart 11 .
       Velars are represented by the plosive k and the fricative g. The fricative is
rather close to the sonorants, it often sounds very much like the labial velar w 12 . It is
remarkable that g changes into w syllable-finally (see 1.3.5).
       Uvulars are represented by the plosive q, which is slightly pharyngealized. In     9
         It is possible that the Alutor system is changing from a system with two classes of
obstruents − plosives and fricatives, to a system with one class of plosives. That is just how the
Koryak consonants are often described (see [Trubetskoy 1958, Zhukova 1972]): all non-plosives
are treated as sonorants. But there are some typological facts that should be taken into
consideration: first, two labial non-nasal sounds are not common in the class of sonorants; second,
if g were a sonorant, we would have its vocalic correlate – a high back non-rounded vowel, but
there is no such vowel in the Alutor system. That is why we prefer to describe the Alutor system
as contrasting between plosives and fricatives. Cf. also the reconstruction proposed in [Mudrak
2000].
      10
          The corresponding phoneme is reconstructed for the Chukchi-Koryak protolanguage
[Muravyova 1986a]: in Alutor it coincided with t, in Koryak − with j/č, in Chukchi − with r, cf.
Alutor tiNak − Koryak jiNek − Chukchi riNek ‘fly’.
      11
          Even if there had been such a sound in the proto-Alutor language, it is likely to have
coincided with the palatal j.
      12
         Such a sound exists, for example, in the Polish language.","[8, 9]"

singular, the final vowel of the person marker undergoes syncope59 , in the dual the marker -t is
added, in the plural the markers -w or -wwi are added.
       Thus, A- and P-markers of transitive verbs are in complementary distribution
between prefix/suffix slots. The S-markers of intransitive verbs are represented in
both slots, the choice depending on the person value. The S-arguments ‘I’, ‘we’, ‘you
(sg)’ are similar (from the point of view of the slot type and the material form) to the
respective A-arguments of transitive verbs, while ‘you (pl)’, ‘(s)he/it’, ‘they’ are
likened (from the point of view of the slot type) to the respective P-arguments of
transitive verbs 60 . It seems that this person differentiation is not random. It
demonstrates the opposition between speech-act participants (l o c u t o r s ) and
participants that are external to the speech act (n o n - l o c u t o r s ). The boundary
between locutors and non-locutors is inside the 2nd person rather than between 2nd
and 3rd person, as is usually assumed. In Alutor the hearer (‘you (sg)’) is a speech-act
participant, while 2nd person nsg (‘you (pl)’) includes, beside the hearer, other
persons, and this is the reason to interpret this totality as a non-locutor. As shown
below, the agreement paradigm testifies, based on cross-linguistically relevant (see
[Kibrik 1997b) opposition between locutors and non-locutors, to the existence of the                  Comment: Ssylka na russkuju

Until now we have been discussing the autonomous (p u r e ) agreement markers. In
fact, however, the marker can often depend on the mood and/or the aspect of the verb
form expressing simultaneously person-number and aspect/mood values. Such
markers will be called c o m b i n e d markers. Pure and combined transparent markers
are presented in a generalized form in Tables 5-7. These Tables take into account the
agreement markers of all finite verb forms, including mood and aspect. It turns out
that in general, pure markers belong to the set of suffixal P-markers, see Table 7 (they
show little variation in the context of the aspect/mood values of the verb form). As for
prefixal S/A-markers, they are all combined with mood values, see Table 5, and     59
        This means of coding the singular is used also for the nominative singular of some nouns,
see 2.3.1.1, as well as for number inflection of adjectives (-qin(a), -kin(a) and others), see 2.2.

        These similarities have independent manifestation in the effects of markedness reversal,

when there is no overt affix 26 following such morphemes. The vowel to be deleted is
always a post-stressed one. In most cases it is the vowel a that undergoes the
transformation, but some roots truncate their final i or u. The process is partly
morphologically defined, because morphemes truncating their final vowels form a
restricted group of the lexicon. In the Dictionary the final vowel of such roots (and
suffixes – see below) is shown in round brackets, cf. tôtul (the root {tatul(a)}) ‘fox’.
Some roots ending in a vowel do not truncate their final vowel, cf. pãnta (the root
{punta}) ‘liver’, @inøri (the root {iniri}) ‘blanket’.
       The deletion is also attested for some suffixes, for example, the possessive
suffix {-in(a)} and other adjectival suffixes that historically originated from the
former, such as {-kin(a)}, {-lin(a)}, {-qin(a)}. The deletion of a root-final vowel
may also occur in a composite, so in this respect the vowel deletion is similar to the
consonant deletion.
       The rules regulating final vowel deletion run as follows:
       if a morpheme is marked for vowel deletion, it loses its final vowel in word-final
position; the deletion may also occur when the morpheme appears as a non-final part
of a composite, i.e.
(3)a. V1 ⇒ ∧ / _# and V1∈ Mvowel deletion
       b. V1 ⇒ ∧ / _= and V1∈ Mvowel deletion (not regularly)
       Examples: tôtul (< {tatul(a)}) ‘fox’, cf. tatãla-wwi ‘foxes’; @ømyt (< imt <
{imt(i)}) ‘burden’, cf. @imtø-ta ‘by a burden’; @yllôNi (< yllaNj < {yllaNj(u)})
‘younger brother’, cf. @yllôNju-ta ‘by a younger brother’; @aNqôkin (< {aNqa-

"2.1.1.2.5. Pluralizer insertion
It was said above that 1st/2nd person S/A-markers are distinguished in only the
singular and non-singular 75 , whereas suffixal 3rd person S- and P-markers are
distinguished in the singular, dual, and plural (see Tables 6-7). The main means used
by agreement to contrast dual vs. plural is a specific marker, a so-called p l u r a l i z e r
( -la) that has a special linear slot (rank +1, see Table 1) 76 . T h e s c o p e o f
p l u r a l i z a t i o n is:
     74
         It should be taken into consideration that these forms are very rare in the speech. In texts
(Part I) only one occurence of this marker in the optative imperfective was found. There are also
some divergences between the paradigm presented in this volume and the paradigm in [Zhukova
1968: 304-05]: in the latter paradigm there are forms q-.....-tkyni-gy-na-t ‘2sg.A+OPT-....-IPF-

differentiates all three number's values 68 , second, it contrasts bjective and esirable moods.
In esirable moods the values of person (-n/-na marker) and number ([syncope of the final -a]
‘sg’, -t ‘du’, -w ‘pl’) are split, see Table 7 and Comment 3 on Table 4. In the bjective moods,
excluding the perfective indicative, the singular (-∅) and non-singular (-t marker) are
differentiated.
      6. The perfective indicative, i.e. the most unmarked aspect-mood form, occurs, on the
contrary, in the most peculiar way, in the context of 3rd person S-argument. 3rd person singular
has the marker -j ‘3sg+PF+IND’, identical to the ‘2sg+PF+IND’ marker. However, it is most
remarkable that 3rd person dual (‘they two’) has a unique marker -gy@yt ‘3du+PF+IND’. 3rd
person plural is not combined by aspect values; the marker -t is combined with mood only and is
identical in the indicative and potential irrespective of aspect.
      7. The existence of the single locutor suffix -t ‘1pl.S’ marker in imperfective, identical to the
‘3nsg.S’ marker for POT and IND, suggests an idea that ‘we many’ includes third persons in the
set of participants (‘we many’ = ‘I+they’), i.e. plurality iconically marks 3rd person rather than 1st
person. This interpretation being accepted the suffixal locutor S-markers are present only in the
perfective aspect with the exception of the potential mood.
      8. After stems with a single final consonant the 3nsg S-marker -na- sometimes has the
allomorph -yna.","[49, 50]"

         In unaccentuated words the vowel length contrast is hardly detectable. It should
be noted that unaccentuated words can be clearly distinguished only if the syllable
supposed to bear stress is an open one, cf. jônut [A] ‘today’ vs. &janut [a] ‘earlier’
(the symbol “ & ” indicates the absence of stress in a word), @inøri [I] ‘blanket’ vs.
&siriri [i] ‘sandpiper’. If such syllable is a closed one, it is more difficult to reveal the
absence of stress.
         The position of stress in Alutor can be described in terms of syllable weight,
thus it is a quantity sensitive system. Two types of syllables are distinguished here:
l i g h t (mono-moraic) syllables and h e a v y (bi-moraic) syllables. Syllables of the
|Сy| type are light syllables, while the other types are all heavy.
         The position of stress in accentuated words is determined by the following three
phonological constraints:
         1) only a heavy syllable can bear stress; light syllables are always unstressed;
         2) only the first or the second syllable can bear stress (but the second syllable is
preferable);
         3) a word-final syllable cannot bear stress.
         These constraints help us to describe all the possible rhythmic patterns. First of
all, a monosyllabic cannot bear stress, for its only syllable is the final one (but there
exist some unaccentuated monosyllablic auxiliary words − see below). In case of a
disyllabic accentuated word, the first syllable is stressed (it always appears to be a
heavy one), for instance, @ôkyk ‘son’, kíttil ‘forehead’, wôla ‘knife’ 20 . Polysyllabics
may have stress either on the first or the second syllable, cf. tølpyqal ‘shoulder’,
tírgytyr ‘meat’, nØgyqin ‘cool’, vitôtyk ‘work’, NyrôlNyn ‘knee’, vagílNyn ‘nail, claw’.
For details see the stress assignment rules (1.3.4.).
         The class of unaccentuated words is represented by the following groups and
subgroups:
         1) auxiliary words of different types, such as conjunctions, particles,
introductory words, and also some adverbs, cf. &qinaq ‘in order to’, &Horo ‘then’,
&matka ‘whether’, &kytvyl ‘not (prohibition)’, &gemat ‘maybe’, &agi ‘very’, &lygan
‘even’, &wasaq ‘sometimes’, &jaqi ‘later’;
         2) some personal pronoun forms, such as:
         a) the dative form with a light second syllable, cf. &gymykyN ‘to me’, &gynykyN
‘to you (sg)’, &@ynykyN ‘to him’, &murykyN ‘to us’, &turykyN ‘to you (pl)’, &@ytykyN     20
         Actually, when morphemes are combined into a word, at intermediate stages there may
appear a monosyllabic word with the only stressed syllable or a disyllabic word with the second
stressed syllable, but such intermediate representations are then extended by means of some
special rules (see 1.3.4.3), cf. Nôjjy (< Nôj < {Naj-∅}) ‘mountain’, Nyvã-jjy (< Nyvã-j < {Nvu-j})
‘(s)he/it began’, gyvô-kki (< gyvô-k < {gva-k}) ‘to stick’.","[13, 14]"

a, the morph -jpyN appears as -epyN; the same variant is used if a stem ends in a two
consonant cluster, because in such cases the epenthetic y is inserted, and the
combination yj in most cases changes into e, though in some rare cases – into i (see
1.3.6), so the marker -ipyN 105 may appear, cf. qaNJav-gypyN ‘ravine, PROLAT’, nut-

-epyN and -ipyN respectively.

-a/-ta: the variant -u is used with stems ending in a consonant or a schwa, while the
variant -nu is used with stems ending in a non-schwa vowel, cf. tavHal-u ‘dried fish,
EQUAT’, keN-u (< {keNy-u}) ‘bear, EQUAT’, but ypa-nu ‘soup, EQUAT’.
      The variants -a/-ta in the comitative and associative are identical with those of

marked with the ergative and controls the prefix agreement slot in polypersonal
conjugation; the P-argument is marked with the nominative and controls the suffix
agreement slot in polypersonal conjugation. In monopersonal conjugation agreement
is controlled by the P-argument.
       I n t r a n s i t i v e verbs have one core S-argument marked with the nominative
that controls the suffix agreement slot in monopersonal conjugation and both
agreement slots in polypersonal conjugation.
       From the point of view of case marking Alutor uses the e r g a t i v e
alignment 117 , unifying the S/P-arguments (with the Absolutive hyperrole) and
opposing them to the A-argument. Monopersonal conjugation is analogous (the
Absolutive is the agreement controller). An interpretation of polypersonal conjugation
is more controversial. Namely, the S-, A- and P-arguments use different sets of
controlled agreement slots: The S-arguments control the prefix as well as suffix slots,
the A-arguments control the prefix slots and the P-arguments control the suffix slots.
Therefore, from the point of view of polypersonal conjugation the t r i p a r t i t e
alignment is realized. From the point of view of the marker's material form, the prefix
markers bring the A- and S-arguments in line with t h e a c c u s a t i v e alignment
(with the Principal hyperrole), opposing them to the P-argument; see 2.1.1.2.
       In the suffix slots the sets of S- and P-markers are different, therefore the suffix
slot realizes the tripartite alignment opposing the S/A/P-arguments.
       In Alutor there are different means of including a verb's arguments into the set
of core arguments as well as excluding them from the set of core arguments. The first
process is called i n c r e a s e , and the second one d e c r e a s e of their syntactic status.
These processes often take place simultaneously as the status of some argument
increases while the status of another one decreases.
       From the point of view of the increase/decrease of the syntactic status, the
nominative position is the most important. This position is always present in a clause
(it can lack material form in the context of ambient verbs or in case of ellipsis). It is
the target of all increasing processes. Therefore, the Absolutive hyperrole can
correspond to different primary semantic roles. In contrast to the nominative position,
the ergative position is stable from the point of view of its role identification: it
merges the agent and experiencer in the Agentive hyperrole. Almost always, it is the
initial position of the government pattern of the respective verb 118 . The only exception
     117
         For a more detailed discussion of the typology of syntactic constructions and the
corresponding hyperroles see [Kibrik 1997a].
     118
         This position can be added in the case of causativization, however in this case it is a
derivational process producing a new lexeme rather that a diathesis change.","[110, 111]"
"1.3.6. Vowel and Glide Coalescence
In Alutor some diphthong-like combinations of the “vowel + glide j, w, @ ” type do
not occur syllable-finally. They usually blend together to produce the corresponding
vowel (mostly a long one). The vowel a and the schwa are most common in such
combinations.
       The coalescence of the vowel a and a glide follows the rules:     37
        The plural marker {w/wwi} seems to have originally had the same distribution of morphs
as the markers k and t: the morph wwi is likely to appear after a stressed syllable, while w
appears in other positions, cf. pantô-wwi ‘pieces of fur from reindeer's legs’, but pylôk-u (<
pylôk-y-w < {plak-w}) ‘fur boots’; but at present the morph -wwi is used not only after a stressed
syllable, but also after any stem ending in a vowel, cf. tatãla-wwi ‘foxes’; a stem ending in a
consonant may have both -u and-uwwi, cf. myng-ãwwi ~ míng-u ‘hands’.",[26]

       (b) if the A-argument is outranked by the P-argument on the Deictic Hierarchy, the non-
transparent marker is needed (it is important that it is the same na- marker).
       (c) If the non-locutor A-argument is deictically not lower than the P-argument 71 , the special
portmanteau non-transparent markers are used, whose choice depends on the deictic properties of
the A-argument (-tki ‘you nsg — him/them’; -ni ‘he — him/them’).
     The P-marker also can be the starting point. It takes place in the following case:

needs the non-transparent marker (ina-).","[52, 53]"

The phonological status of this segment and its functions are discussed in 1.1.1.2.
       Besides quality, we also distinguish vowels in terms of quantity: the non-schwa
vowels can be either short or long 1 . The vowel length is often conditioned by the
position of a vowel in a word, but in some cases there is a phonological opposition
between short and long vowels. The vowel length in Alutor deserves further
discussion: the length contrast of e and o is discussed in 1.1.1.3, the length contrast of
i, u, a is discussed in 1.1.1.4.","[2, 3]"
"1.1.1.3. Long and Short e and o
Vowels e and o always appear as long segments in open stressed or open pre-stressed
syllables (that is in the first or the second syllable of an Alutor word − see 1.2), cf.
@ógyv [E] ‘yesterday’, jepílNyn [E] ‘hoof’, tùrak [O] ‘sink’, lJotítkyn [O] ‘top’.
      Short e and o are found in several roots in closed stressed and closed pre-
stressed syllables before or after q and H, cf. lóqtyk [e] (along with løqtyk) ‘come
back’, HoptílJHu [o] ‘all’, qùnpyN [o] (along with qãnpyN) ‘always’. In post-stressed
syllables, both open and closed, the vowels e and o are usually short, cf. @ísse [e]
‘aunt’, tytôtoratkyn [o] ‘I'll sink’. The latter situation can be treated as standard
vowel shortening in post-stressed position − see 1.3.7 5 . Short e and o are also found
in non-accentuated auxiliary words (see 1.2.2), cf. &gemat [e] ‘maybe’, &Horo [o]
‘then’ (non-accentuated words are marked with “ & ”).
      Long E and O are also found in both open and closed syllables in so-called
“expressive” words, cf. tOk ‘(interjection) let us’ (for more details see 1.3.8.1).
Expressive lengthening of this kind can be found in many languages, but such long
vowels are not considered separate phonemes.
      Thus, in Alutor long and short e and o occur in positions that complement each
other. That is why we find it possible to treat a long phone and its short counterpart as     4
        It is worth mentioning that native speakers of Alutor are not aware of the schwa as a
segment of their pronunciation, whether predictable or not. They think some Alutor words have
only consonants; at the same time, they can easily divide such words into syllables. For instance, a
word which sounds like pyNílly ‘news’ is treated as having three syllables – |p|Nl|l| (the symbol “ |
” indicates syllable boundaries), wítwyt ‘flower’ – as |wt|wt|, HítvyHyt ‘boat’ – as |Ht|v|Ht|. The
same is true for the Koryak language. E.A.Kreynovich [Kreynovich 1958] proposed for Koryak
words the non-vocalised representation (that is without y), but with marked syllable boundaries,
like |wt|wt|. Since the schwa is not part of such representation, the author does not consider it a
phoneme. In our opinion, such approach in neither adequate nor typologically justified, because
there arises a problem of dividing words into syllables – some words have unpredictable syllable
division. Nevertheless, E.A.Kreynovich was the first to pay attention to the crucial importance of
the notion of syllable for Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages. As we will see further, this notion is
absolutely necessary to create well-formed Alutor words.
      5
        From an historical point of view, the Alutor long E and O originated mostly from aj and
aw, or from yj and yw, and original e and o changed into i and u in most positions (they are
preserved only in closed syllables before or after q and H – see above), cf. the following related
words from Alutor and Koryak: Alutor jepílNyn [E] – Koryak jajpylNyn ‘hoof’, Alutor lJotítkyn
[O] – Koryak lJawtytkyn ‘the top of smth.’, Alutor @imNãlyk – Koryak @emNolyk ‘to miss (smb.)’,
but Alutor lóqtyk – Koryak leqtyk ‘to come back’, Alutor qùnpyN – Koryak qonpyN ‘always’

The 2nd person optative semantically coincides with the imperative 63 , because exactly in this
speech situation the speaker perlocutively affects the addressee with the speech act.
      5. The 1nsg value does not differentiate between the conjunctive and the optative: these
moods have the single myn- agreement marker 64 , in contrast to 1sg. In the context of the
conjunctive 1sg uses the t- marker, identical to the one used in the unmarked moods, and such a
merger takes place only for this person. Probably the maximal degree of control on the part of the
speaker over the desirable event is important: inasmuch as the speaker has an S/A-role in the
event, the probability of its accomplishment is estimated by the speaker to be very close to real
event.
      6. A unique 1sg marker is present in the optative (m-). In this mood the speaker is
simultaneously the sender as well as the recipient of the prescription. It should be taken into
account that this mood does not have its own marker and differs from the indicative only by
means of agreement markers, i.e. the speech acts with different S/A-arguments are cognitively
different. The following types of desires are distinguished: a desire addressed to the speaker
himself (m-), addressed to the speaker and other persons (myn-), addressed to the hearer and,
optionally, to other persons (n-) (in the latter case the addressee of desire being virtual rather than
actual).","[47, 48]"
"1.3.3.3. Schwa and Consonant Metathesis
According to rule (6c), in the string C1-C2C3 the schwa is inserted at a morpheme
boundary, that is between C1 and C2, but in many words it actually appears between
C2 and C3, so that C1 and C2 occur adjacently. This usually happens when C1 and C2
are homorganic consonants (namely dentalveolars). We treat this transformation as
metathesis of a schwa and a consonant.
       The metathesis rules run as follows:
       if a three-consonant cluster of the underlying representation has been broken
up by a schwa, the vowel may change places with the second consonant, provided the
first and the second consonant are dentalveolars 32 , i.e.
(7)a. y-C2 ⇒ -C2y / C1_C3 and C1,C2 are dentalveolars (optionally)
       b. y=C2 ⇒ =C2y / C1_C3 and C1,C2 are dentalveolars (optionally)
       Examples: tyHí1ly@yn (< tyHyly-l@y-n < {tHyl-l@-n}) ‘sick (person)’, cf.
nymíl@yn (< {nym-l@-n}) ‘settled person, villager’.",[23]

      Laryngeals deserve special consideration. The glottal stop @ is sometimes used
as an auxiliary segment, for instance, it is found before any word-initial vowel. In
such contexts the glottal stop is predictable: it is inserted in accordance with the
standard rules (see 1.3.3.1). But in other contexts this segment is unpredictable, so it
must be treated as part of the underlying representation, cf. ny@ôlyk (< {n@al-k})
‘become’ (the root {n@al}), @yllô@a (< {ylla@-a}) ‘by a mother’ (the root {ylla@}),
nymôl@a (< {n-mal-@a}) ‘well’ (the circumfix {n-...-@a}). In syllable-final position
the glottal stop behaves similar to the glides w and j (see 1.3.6). The sound H is an
epiglottal plosive laryngeal, that is a glottal stop accompanied by epiglottis
lowering 14 . Due to such configuration the larynx becomes closed and the pharynx is
narrowed in its lower part. Like the uvular q, the Alutor H is also slightly
pharyngealized. That is why both q and H make the adjacent vowels more wide. There
is an obvious contrast between the sounds @ and H, cf. jã@yk ‘reach’ − vøHyk ‘die’, but
the fact was not mentioned in previous papers on Alutor 15 .","[9, 10]"

affixes similar to the spatial cases. Converbs do not have any inflectional categories.",[67]
"2.1.7.4. Conjunctive
The conjunctive's semantics is related to an event P that is desirable for the speaker,
but is not realized in the actual world. In contrast to the optative, also related to the
domain of desirability, the conjunctive represents the desirability of event P as a
given, without the speaker's aim to participate actively in the event. The degree of
reality of an event can vary, from highly probable, especially if the speaker is the
actor of the event, to irreal— in conditional clauses. Conjunctive verb forms are
translated in different ways.
       Forms in the 1sg actor conjunctive are translated as “should not I do P”, where
P is denoted by the conjunctive verb form:(42) a. ...lygut          ana       ty-@y-Nvu-na                    mimly-N

      COMMENTS on Table 6
      1. As mentioned above, the ‘2nsg.S’ marker, -tyk, is largely independent from aspect/mood
values, and also identical to the ‘2nsg.P’ marker (see Table 7).
      2. In contrast to the imperfective 65 , the perfective tends to be combined with specific locutor
suffixal markers (absent only in the perfective potential 66 ). 1st person agreement markers are
identical for the indicative, conjunctive, and optative. In these moods the singular is -k ‘1sg.S+PF’
marker, non-singular is -myk ‘1nsg.S+PF’ (identical to the marker ‘1nsg.P’). As with the 2nd
person singular, its markers are also combined with mood values: -j ‘2sg+PF+IND’, -n
‘2sg+PF+CONJ’, -gi ‘2sg+PF+OPT’.
      3. Usually in the context of perfective potential (with the final component -N) and the
singular S-arguments the suffixal agreement markers are absent (see Appendix), however
sporadically the marker -i (the same for all persons 67 ) appears, thus it can be given a value of
‘sg.S+PF+POT’.
      4. It should be mentioned that an interpretation of the empty suffix slot for ‘2sg.S+PF.POT’
is complicated. The proposed interpretation (the lack of markers) is motivated by the locutor
status of ‘2sg’, merging with the 1st person. However another interpretation is also possible, that
is, the existence of a zero marker. The following generalizations favor this interpretation: if it is
true, then (a) the tendency for the 2nd and 3rd persons to merge into singular markers becomes
stronger, (b) 2nd person singular in the perfective always has a suffix marker.
      5. The 3rd person has its own subsystem, for clarity presented in Table 6a. First, 3rd person     65
         In this aspect locutors do not have overt suffix markers, see Comment 7 below about
marker -t ‘1pl.S’ in imperfective aspect.
      66
         See, however, Comment 3 below.
      67

"        In this way, the antipassive is not obligatorily followed by a decrease in
transitivity; see (10b).
        In Alutor there are verbs that are always accompanied by the ina- marker, for
example, in.emy- ‘scoop, draw’ (etymologically bound with the intransitive verb
emy- ‘go for water’). This verb has three arguments (agent, patient, and instrument),
optionally complemented by benefactive. The interpretation is possible that in
primary diathesis there is no argument that fills the highest position, therefore the
location of any argument in this position is marked with the inversion marker:(11) a. ynnu           in.emy-tky-n             miml-a           eminaN-a

3.1.3.2. Semantics of the antipassive
In a number of cases the use of the antipassive is motivated by the
c o m m u n i c a t i v e s t r u c t u r e of an utterance, namely by the need of the speaker
to focus attention on an argument occupying a non-central position in the verbal
government pattern or, conversely, to remove an argument from a pragmatically
salient position. Thus in the following examples the use of the antipassive is
motivated by the need to remove the patient from the utterance:

"1.3.4.3. Syllable Addition
It appears that the rhythmic structure of the language does not permit stress to fall on
the last syllable of a word, but strings with the last stressed syllable may appear at
intermediate stages of derivation (see rules I and II). In order to improve the rhythmic
structure a supplementary syllable is added.
      The syllable addition rules run as follows:
      if the stress falls on the last (closed) syllable of a word, a supplementary
syllable of the |CV| type is added by means of geminating the last consonant and     35
         In Alutor there are neither stressed disyllabics with the second light syllable nor stressed
disyllabics with the first light and the second open syllable.
      36
         Otherwise, i.e. if the first syllable is light, the word does not acquire any stress.",[25]

      COMMENTS on Table 5
      1. S/A-markers consistently merge the indicative and the potential as bjective moods.
The use of these moods presupposes the existence of corresponding events. The indicative mood
characterizes the event as existing in a real world, and the potential mood, as existing in a virtual
world. The conjunctive and the optative are unified by the idea of esirable modality: they
indicate the events of the world of a speaker's desires (see the semantics of mood in 2.1.7.1 —
2.1.7.4).
      2. In unmarked bjective moods (IND and POT) only locutors have the prefixal
agreement markers, and these markers can be considered pure. In esirable moods the mood
and deictic values are combined 62 , therefore non-locutors also have prefix markers.
      3. 2nd and 3rd person conjunctives (CONJ) have the single marker n-, indicating a S/A-
participant, whom the speaker does not control. The choice of the same marker for 3rd person
optative (OPT) is not random.
      4. 2nd person optative has a specific marker q-, which is differentiated from the 3rd person.",[47]
"2.4.3. Demonstrative pronouns
Viewed from their morphological properties, demonstrative pronominal adjectives are
similar to relative adjectives (see 2.2.2); they usually consist of the demonstative root
plus the suffix {-in(a)} 112 . The main Alutor demonstrative adjectives are: {ynN.in(a)}
‘this’,    {wut.in(a)/wutt.in(a)/wutt.aq}        ‘this’,   {Nan.in(a)/Nan.ka}      ‘that’,
{igynNin(a)} ‘such’.
        The demonstratives are used both attributively and without a head noun. Being
used attributively, demonstratives agree with their head noun in person and number,
the markers being the same as for other adjectives with the suffix -in(a).
        Being used without a head noun, they function like the 3rd person pronouns. In
this case demonstratives are inflected using 1st or the 2nd declension forms
depending on their referent (non-human/ human respectively). The most frequent
case-number forms are shown in the Dictionary 113 .

      In the context of the phasal verb ‘begin’, the infinitive is often combined with
the desiderative marker specifying the modal description of the event: the infinitive
designates that the agent of the event attempts to accomplish the action:(57) a. imjaq         yjava.k        ynpy=qura-Na                      kytawyt

2.2. Adjectives
Alutor shows a clear morphological opposition between two classes of adjectives:
q u a l i t a t i v e adjectives and r e l a t i v e adjectives. These classes of adjectives
have different markers and belong to different derivation types. Qualitative adjectives
appear as an original lexical group, while relative adjectives are derived from other
parts of speech (mostly nouns).
        From a syntactic point of view adjectives are used either a u t o n o m o u s l y
(i.e. as separate words, usually attributes or predicates), or in i n c o r p o r a t i o n . An
adjective can be used attributively only when its head noun is marked for the
nominative (see 2.2.4). In this case an attribute agrees in p e r s o n and n u m b e r
with its head noun. If an adjective is used predicatively, it also agrees in person and
number with its S-actant, so the forms used in both situations are identical. In the case
its head noun is not a nominative case form, an adjective is usually incorporated (for
details see 2.2.4).
        We will first consider qualitative and relative adjectives used autonomously,
and then discuss adjective incorporation.","[81, 82, 83, 84]"
"
       One of the possible ways of describing vowel deletion at a morpheme boundary
is in terms of the “vowel strength”. Some vowels appear to be weaker than others and
tend to be elided. The relation “to be weaker” is marked here with the symbol “ < ”.
According to this relation, Alutor vowels display the following hierarchy:
       y < a, A < e, o < i, I < u, U.
       The rules regulating vowel deletion run as follows:
       if two vowels occur adjacently at an ordinary morpheme boundary, the weakest
one is deleted, i.e.
(4)a. V1 ⇒ ∧ / _-V2 and V1 < V2
       b. V2 ⇒ ∧ / V1-_ and (V2 < V1 or V2 = V1 28 )
       Examples: tinônititavyN (< {ta-ina-n-itit-av-N}) ‘(s)he will cook’, gajãlin (<
{ga-aju-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he revived’, gøvlin (< {ga-iv-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he said’, @ãmka (< {a-     27
        Actually, not any vowel may appear morpheme-initially or morpheme-finally, so the list
of possible combinations of vowels is considerably restricted.
     28
        When we use the sign “ = ” with blank spaces on both sides in the context of the rules, it
means equality, not a composite boundary (the latter is used without any spaces).",[20]

     COMMENTS on Table 1
     The front and the back vowels are rather close to the central ones. The back vowels are
rounded: u is strongly rounded, while o is moderately rounded. The mid vowels stand at
approximately equal distance from the high and low vowels: they are neither open nor close. The
vowel y is a central mid vowel, but its main variant is a little bit lower than e and o. The long
vowels do not differ considerably in quality from their short counterparts.",[3]

      The category m o o d is also obligatory. It has four values:
      - i n d i c a t i v e (IND), does not have its own specific markers;
      - o p t a t i v e (OPT), does not have its own specific markers 48 ;
      - p o t e n t i a l (POT), circumfix marker ta-...(-N) 49 , framing the verb stem;
      - c o n j u n c t i v e (CONJ), prefix marker @-/A- 50 .
      Besides these, in Alutor there is also an impersonal form of the i m p e r a t i v e
(see 2.1.3).
      Finally, the finite verb agrees 51 in person and number with its core arguments,
distinguishing three persons (1st/2nd/3rd person) and three numbers — s i n g u l a r
(sg), d u a l (du) and p l u r a l (pl) 52 . Intransitive verbs agree with their sole core
argument (S - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the nominative, and have, aspect and mood
being fixed, 9 person-number forms. The transitive verb agrees simultaneously with
the agentive argument (A - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the ergative as well as with the
patientive argument (P - a r g u m e n t 53 ) marked with the nominative, and has, aspect
     48
         The mood value is coded cumulatively, together with person-number values, see below.
     49
          The suffix component of the circumfix can be covert, for example, in imperfective
potential. The potential marker coincides with desiderative marker (see 2.1.3 below).
      50
         The marker A- is a phonetic variant of the marker @- in specific positions (see 1.3.6).
      51
         In Alutor the person-number markers are combined with the unmarked usage of personal
pronouns in the core argument positions, so it is possible to interpret them as agreement markers.
      52
          As the paradigms show, semantically this tripartite personal opposition has its own
internal structure. The opposition ‘singular — non-singular’ (sg — nsg) consists of six deictic
items. Elementary single entities are defined in terms of speech act participants (1sg = ‘speaker’,
2sg = ‘hearer’) and non-participants of the speech act (3sg = ‘somebody’). Non-singular entities
are totalities of elementary entities: 1nsg = ‘speaker and hearer/somebody’, 2nsg = ‘hearer and
somebody’, 3nsg = ‘somebody and somebody’ (i.e. the countable number opposition of
homogenous entities is present only in the 3rd person). Exactly these entities are ordered in the
Deictic Hierarchy (see Figure 1 below). The arrangement of non-singular entities with respect to
singular entities is semantically motivated. Thus, ‘1nsg’ includes, besides the speaker, the hearer
and/or the 3rd person. Such an entity is lower on the Hierarchy than ‘1sg’. Simultaneously this
entity is higher than ‘2sg’, because it includes the speaker, and this factor is most important for
the Hierarchy. The motivation for ‘2nsg’ is similar.
      Within the scope of the non-singular there is a proper number opposition of dual and plural
(du and pl), because the number of homogenous elementary entities increases, and this opposition
uses iconically specific coding devices (see 2.1.1.2.4). Dual does not have a surface expression (it
is possible to postulate the zero marker), and plural is expressed by a specific morpheme —
pluralizer -la.
      In that way the prototypical number opposition is represented in the subsystem of 1/2nd
person nsg, and partially in 3rd person sg/nsg.
