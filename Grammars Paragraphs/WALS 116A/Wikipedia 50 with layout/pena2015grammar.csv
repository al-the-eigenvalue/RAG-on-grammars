word is present: =ki ‘Rhetorical question’141 and =pa ‘Question marker’. Both =ki and

constituent of the clause, as in (50), (52). The common element is that the interrogative

question. This may be related to a hypothesized old function of =ki as a focus-marker: in
Awajun, a cognate form -ki is apparently used as a focus marker (Overall 2007: 182). This
function is not clearly present in Wampis.",[402]
"
         The other use of =api in Wampis is in tag questions. In that function =api too
attaches to a verb or nominal element and turns a declarative proposition into a
question. Not surprisingly, most examples of =api in tag questions come from
conversations, as in the following example.(33)t͡ʃi ́i ɛ́itkas aán uháktahɛɛ ámɨkɨapi mini ́ttamɨ

‘Okay, I am going to inform like that, only you are going to come, aren’t you?’18.10. Mirative
         The category of Mirativity is related to the expectation of knowledge: “the term
mirativity refers to the linguistic marking of an utterance which is new or unexpected to
the speaker” (DeLancey 2001b: 370), information that is thus new and not yet part of
the “speaker’s integrated picture of the world” (DeLancey 1997: 49). The mirative in
Wampis is done with the morpheme =hama. This morpheme can occur su#xed or
detached from the verb,261 forming its own prosodic word, thus I treated as a clitic-like
261. In some cases, while transcribing, speakers would correct me if I did not write hama as a
separate word.",[827]
"
        An example of an interrogative intonation contour is given with a question [i ́i
urúk puhúmɛinkit] ‘how can we live?’ in Figure 6.14. The highest pitch is received by
the pronoun íi ‘1pl’ (which is pragmatically focused in this sentence) and then by the
question word uruka [urúk] ‘how’.",[328]
"
• In contrast, the copula clitics are used in present tense declarative, in content and  polarity questions, and exclamative clauses. The exception to this copula clitic
  restriction is one copula clitic that is used in past tense: =ia.",[780]

"        The next example illustrates the use of the copula clitics in exclamative set-
inclusion clauses. Notice that the question marker =ka can optionally occur in
exclamative sentences and may be being reanalyzed as a non-declarative marker. If the
question marker =ka occurs, the order of the morphemes is the same as in
interrogatives, i.e. the question marker precedes the copula clitic. Note that the negative
is used in this case to emphasize the idea of surprise of the expression, not in its literal
‘negation’ meaning.(61) auʃa ɲawánt͡ʃukɛit!

‘That is a jaguar!’        The sentence in (62) below contains an example of the use of the preterite
copula clitic. I only have a handful of occurrences of this morpheme in my data, and it
is apparently not very productive. For comparison, a question in present tense is also
presented in (63). In the data for Wampis, the copula can refer to the remote or recent
past. Notice that Overall (2007) reports a cognate remote past copula su#x -ya in                                             755

ia=ita            au=ʃa
who=COP           DIST=ADD‘Who is that?’         In addition, I was told by one of my teachers that a sentence like (64), which
was pronounced with the clitic, should be transcribed as presented in (65); i.e.
""corrected"" with a fully conjugated copula verb. It is possible thus that the copula clitic
=ia comes from the homophonous remote past tense marker -ia that is present in (65).","[795, 796]"
        The question marker is historically related to the focus marker =ka (cf. §18.4).,[825]
"
However, unlike the focus marker, which never undergoes apocope, the question
marker does undergo apocope, as in (29) above.",[825]
"144. Except the 3SG -ni that only occurs in question words (in subordinate verbs, third person is
marked with nasalization on the last vowel of the stem).",[407]
"
18.9. Sudden realization =api and Tag question =api
        The clitic =api is primarily used when someone realizes that something has not
gone as expected, with an outcome usually regarded as negative. Unlike the mirative,
the event depicted by =api is typically directly associated to a volitive action done by
the speaker and thus the event is not as strongly counter-expected as with the mirative.",[825]
"
         As a ""nal point, notice that uruka and itura can replace not only NPs but also
predicates. When replacing predicates, these question words take all the morphological
markers of the replaced verb.",[411]

18.8. Interrogative =ka

only     return-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
‘Do you only rewind it [i.e. the cassette]?’         Though =ka occurs mostly on nouns and verbs, it actually can be received by

most parts of speech: pronouns, adjectives and adverbs. The following is an example in
which the interrogative =ka attaches to a noun.(29) ámɨ wari ́ arútmak wɛi ́nkʲatam

‘So you, which Arutam are you going to see?’        An important morphological property of the question clitic marker is that it
occurs before the copula clitics:(30) pɨ ́ŋkɨrkɛita

"
• Syntactically, interrogative words remain “in situ” depending on the gramamtical role they ful""ll and are rarely moved to the front of the clause. That question words occur
 in their “normal” position is apparently a frequent pattern of predicate-""nal languages
 (Payne 1997: 301).",[399]
"
           The simultaneous -ku in question words is used when a related action in the
discourse is seen as ongoing. In (62), uruka ‘how’ occurs with the simultaneous -ku
(notice in this case the 2PL person marking on the question word). The question in the
example is asked with a reason sense of ‘why is this happening to you?’ (a free                                                     368
translation equivalent would be: ‘What’s up with you?’). Notice that the imperfective
marker -a occurs with the simultaneous -ku (this happens regularly in subordinate verbs
(§19.6).(62) húʃa urukákrumɨa

‘How are we doing like this?’        The reason I analyze the form uruka as ‘how+IPFV’ is that the vowel /a/ of uruka
does not undergo elision in spite of being in a place to be deleted (Wampis deletes the
third vowel from the left, as explained in Chapter VI). So, my analysis is that the
imperfective fuses with the last vowel /a/ of uruka, blocking vowel elision (this is a
regular pattern in Wampis, as explained in §5.3.5). Compare with the surface form of
uruka in (64), where the vowel /a/ is deleted. So, morphologically, it appears as if the
interrogative word is treated like a verbal stem. The facts that uruka can take subject
markers, subordinators and apparently imperfective aspect makes them “clausal” (or
verbal) in behavior.","[408, 409]"

"
       Especially during my ""eldwork in 2013, my teachers and co-workers often
helped me ask questions or explain the tasks in Wampis to other Wampis speakers. They
also acted as interlocutors to make speakers feel more comfortable and generally to set
a more natural environment. When I was the only interlocutor, I tried to interact with
interviewee(s) in Wampis so that they did not feel they were in an “arti""cial” setting. In
general, I tried to establish a recording setting in which the speaker would speak to an
interlocutor and not to a microphone. Even in cases where I myself did not use Wampis
properly, I managed to create a more comfortable atmosphere to work and people felt
more compelled to expand their role to supplement information and teach me how to
say in Wampis what I wanted to communicate. This, in turn, opened additional
opportunities to ask more questions about the language. However, in cases when I was
not able to convey my thoughts using Wampis and felt communication was broken, I
resorted to Spanish to try to maximize understanding of the task at hand.",[89]

17.5.2.1. The expression of TAM categories
       With regard to TAM categories, the following principles distinguish the copula a,
the copula clitics and the existential a in Wampis (they are explained in the subsequent
discussion, below):
• The copula a is used in non-present declarative moods (including past and future
                                            739

5.5. Vowel harmony
        The restrictive =kɨ (cf. §18.3) and the su#x -ki(ni) ‘do action while moving’ (cf.
§13.3.2.6) undergo processes of vowel harmony. Vowel harmony involves the vowels
/i/ and /ɨ/. A particular pattern in Wampis (as will be seen from the discussion in
§5.5.1 and §5.5.2) is that, regardless of order, the high front vowel /i/ dominates over
the high central vowel /ɨ/ for purposes of vowel harmony. It is interesting that vowel
harmony between /i/ and /ɨ/ somehow “re/ects” the phonotactic restriction that
prohibits clusters /iɨ/ or /ɨi/ (§4.3.2).","[254, 255, 256]"

         As can be seen, some question words (especially the ones derived with the roots
uru) are historically complex. Words with the roots uru occur with the formatives -ka (in                                           355
‘how’), -ti (in ‘when’) and -ma (in ‘how many’); however, these su#xal formatives are
already fossilized and their meanings are not easily identi""able. The formative *-ka is
very likely a fossilized version of the interrogative clitic =ka that is otherwise
productive in the Wampis language (see §18.8). Based on semantics and phonetic
similarity, the formative *-ti that occurs with uru to form the time question word ‘when’
could be related to the derivational su#x -tin ‘time’ (which can be shortened to -ti ́ (see
example (90) later in this chapter), that is used to derive adverbials that express ideas
of date and season (see §8.6.2.1). I have found no evidence of a possible source for the
formative *-ma. In addition, uruka ‘how’ has a variant uruku that seems to be an old
nominalized form bearing Set II nominalizer -u ‘Subject nominalizer’ (§15.4.5). This
form uruku, in the data, only occurs when the interrogative word bears the locative
=numa (see example (42)), the inferential =t͡su or in combination with a cliticized
copula (see (71), down below); intriguingly, these three elements cliticize to nouns (or
noun phrases).139
        The next examples illustrate the use of interrogative words in action:
139. In only one example in the data uruku occurs with the past habitual =huk, which occurs
with verbs.","[395, 396]"

6.7. Summary of stress and tone
       It seems evident from all the previous discussion that the prosodic system of
Wampis does not really ""t well in the so-called category of “pitch accent”: stress in
Wampis is not only realized via high pitch (i.e. high tone)—this is a traditional
de""nition of “accent” (one high pitch per word); rather stress in Wampis is a mix of
articulatory cues related to vowel and consonant lengthening in addition to high pitch;                                                      283
stress is also manifested in the vowel elision patterns described in the preceding
sections. On the other hand, I have shown that in Wampis there can be more than one
phonetic realization of high tone in a word; what is more, some roots, a#xes and clitics
of di$erent nature (verbal, nominal, etc) have a lexically-speci""ed high tone. Lexically-
speci""ed high tone disregards the stress pattern of the language. In addition to that,
high tone has functional load in the language, as it marks case. So, in light of the facts
just mentioned, how “pitch-accent” is Wampis? I argue that an answer to that question
is circular in principle, because we would have to start by giving a very ad-hoc
de""nition of “pitch-accent”, which would not ""t any well known cross-linguistic
prototype. The present attempt at analyzing Wampis prosody, on the other hand, shows
that Wampis can be analyzed in terms of two very well known prototypes of prosodic
system: stress and tone. Wampis is not a prototypical stress language nor is it a
prototypical tone language, it has features of both ends of the continuum.","[322, 323, 324]"

marginal distribution in the Wampis system are: a) the glottal stops in these words
cannot be omitted; i.e. they are integral part of the word, or the words are otherwise
considered incorrect; b) there are indeed contrastive pairs with other consonants (cf.

Overall, the velar nasal does not have phonemic status in Jivaroan languages, and
therefore is not reconstructable. Further, he submits that a rhotic proto-phoneme *r
needs to be reconstructed, rather than *ŋ. In Awajun, there is a merger of *r with a
velar *h, but the *r is a shared retention and not an innovation in the hypothesized
7. Turner actually speaks of a velar vibrant (“vibrante velar”), rather than nasal.",[47]

representation in sound . . . in respect to manner, colour, sound, smell, action, state or
intensity” (Doke 1935: 118) and whose “meanings are in the domain of sensory
imagery” (Dingemanse 2014: 387). Ideophones are widespread in languages of the
Amazonia (Payne 1999a) and they are certainly very important in Wampis discourse. I
include onomatopoetic words (words that mimic phonetically the source of sound they
try to describe) in the class of ideophones.","[452, 453, 454]"

‘With what am I going to buy me pigs?’• Interrogative words receive a special set of person markers and can carry subordinators        Wampis interrogative words uruka and itura have some unusually complex
person marking. These interrogative words employ unique person su#xes that mark the
person of the subject of their clause (Table 8.8). These person markers di$er from the
set of person markers used with ""nite declarative verbs. Question words can also occur
with some subordinating su#xes (see Table 8.9 below): the person markers occur
optionally (but frequently) when the interrogative word bears the subordinating
su#xes, but they occur rarely when the interrogative word stands alone. For
comparison, person markers of declarative forms are also provided in Table 8.8 (for
analysis of person marking on verbs, see §14.3). To the best of my knowledge, these
unique interrogative-based person markers (as well as the subordinators) do not occur
with ia ‘who’, tu ‘where, which’ and uari ̃ ‘what’.","[404, 405]"

        The simple possessive construction is done with a noun marked as possessed, the
195. It is not yet clear whether there is a Determiner Phrase in Wampis. Morphosyntactically, I
have shown that all of the above mentioned elements that serve to determine an noun have very
di$erent properties and there is no evidence that they form a class (see Chapter VIII). But the
question of a Determiner Phrase merits further research—identifying tests such as coordination
is di#cult as coordination is not very relevant in Wampis. Thus, more evidence, specially in
terms of designing tests, are needed to consider a Determiner Phrase as a relevant structure in
Wampis.",[538]
"
        In fact, some examples suggest that at least uruka could be treated as a question
verb. In (68), the interrogative word uruka receives the future marker -ta and the 1PL
marker -hi (which is taken from the set that occurs only with ""nite declarative verbs),
just like “normal” lexical verbs in declarative mood can. Notice also that the translation
suggests some lexical meaning to the interrogative word, as there is no elided verb “do”
in the Wampis structure.(68) urúkathik jamɛ́iʃa i ́iŋkʲa aʃi ́ amútmaktathiapi

         While these examples are not numerous, they are not quite infrequent. In fact,
similar examples evidence that the morphosyntactic possibilities of interrogative words
in Wampis are unusually complex. Future research with additional data may shed more
light on the complex properties of Wampis interrogatives.","[412, 413]"

18.3. Restrictive =kɨ
        The clitic =kɨ restricts the reference of the element that receives it. The
restrictive has an allophone =ki that occurs when the preceding vowel is /i/, following
a vowel harmony process (cf. §5.5.1). The most basic semantics of the restrictive can be
translated to English as ‘only’ or ‘alone’.(1) ɲawãaḱ

‘He only’ or ‘He alone’          The restrictive occurs not only with nouns, but can also occur on pronouns,
numerals and, occasionally, adverbs. The restrictive is also fossilized in words related to
counting and to temporal or geographical distance. The following examples illustrate
=kɨ with a pronoun (3) and a numeral (4). Example (5) shows =kɨ with the adverb
‘now’ and derives a word meaning ‘right now’. Example (8) shows =kɨ fossilized on
number ‘one’.(3)

         In discourse, the restrictive =kɨ usually serves to mark a stance. In the next
example, the referents have been mentioned and clearly identi""ed because they are a
speech act participant (‘you’) and a proper noun (‘Andrés’). In the conversation the
statement ‘They are only two people’ occurs when the speaker is trying to convince his
interlocutor to go to a meeting (he is trying to explain that two people have been
chosen to go to this meeting—his interlocutor, referred by ‘you’, and ‘Andrés’, who is
not present) and that everything is already set for his interlocutor and ‘Andrés’ to go.","[810, 811, 812]"

(or a part of it) is repeated. Reduplication of verbs and adjectives is relatively
productive in the Wampis language. In addition, numerals use partial reduplication to
convey a distributional meaning (see §8.8.1). Reduplication can be interpreted as
in/ection (to convey a grammatical function such as plurality) and as derivation (to
create new words). The basic principles of reduplication in Wampis are:
• The reduplicated material usually forms its own prosodic word separate from the base  word.128
• The reduplicated material always appears before the base word in partial  reduplication.","[359, 360, 361]"
