      4.3 Polar questions
        Answers to polar questions
            A polar question has as answers a pair of polar opposites, positive and negative. The
            answers to Is it ready? are It is ready and It is not ready (or equivalently Yes and No, or Yes,
            it is and No, it’s not, and so on). The propositional content of one answer is expressed in
            the question itself, and that of the other is obtained by reversing the polarity.5
                Usually it is the positive that is expressed in the question, but it can also be the negative,
            as in the biased question Isn’t it ready?
            Choice between Yes and No determined by answer
            Yes and no are used in positive and negative answers respectively: the choice between
            them is determined by the polarity of the answer, with the polarity of the question
            being irrelevant. Thus Yes, it is and No, it’s not are answers to both Is it ready? and Isn’t it
            ready? Yes on its own, however, is relatively unlikely to be used as a response to a negative
            question.",[888]
"        Juxtaposition of variable and polar or alternative questions
         It is not uncommon for a variable question to be followed by a polar or alternative
         question which pragmatically supersedes it:
         [24] i What’s her name? Is it Anne?
              ii What’s her name? Is it Anne or Anna?
         In [i] the polar question suggests an answer to the variable one. If the answer is positive,
         then answering the second also provides the answer to the first – though the typical form,
         Yes, shows that it is given in response to the polar question. If the answer is negative,
         then another answer to the variable question is needed – No, it’s Anna (as we saw above,
         this kind of response is often given when the variable question is merely implicit). In
         [ii] the alternative question reformulates the variable one, narrowing down the range
         of possible answers; this time, whatever the answer to the second question is, it will
         simultaneously be an answer to the first. (To respond with Neither: it’s Amy is not to
         answer the alternative question but to reject its presupposition: see §6.1 below.)
         In either the polar or the alternative case, the second question will often be elliptically reduced:
         [25] i What’s her name? Anne?
              ii What’s her name? Anne or Anna?
         Such reduction will be particularly likely when the full form would involve more lexical
         repetition than is the case with [24]: Who do you think I am? (Do you think I am) Father
         Christmas?; What are you going to give him? (Are you going to give him) a book or just money?
            We have punctuated the questions in [24] and [25] as separate sentences, but they could
         also be integrated into a single written sentence: e.g., for [24], What’s her name – Anne? With
         an alternative question, but not a polar, they can be separated simply by a comma: What’s her
         name, Anne or Anna? Similarly, in speech there are different degrees of prosodic integration
         between the two questions. This is one of the places where it is difficult to draw a sharp
         distinction between a succession of two grammatical sentences on the one hand and a single
         sentence on the other.",[896]
" Pragmatic differences between polar and polar-alternative questions
  Although polar questions are logically equivalent to their polar-alternative counterparts,
  there are considerable pragmatic differences between them. The polar version is simpler
  and much more frequent: it can be regarded as the default version. We draw attention
  here to a selection of contexts favouring one rather than the other of the two.
  (a) Polar-alternative emphasises choice
  The explicit expression of the negative often has an emphatic effect. One reason for my
  emphasising the choice might be that you have failed to give a satisfactory response,
  i.e. an answer, to a previous polar question. In such a context, the polar-alternative
  question is likely to have an impatient, hectoring, or petulant tone, conveying “Make
  up your mind”, “Give me an answer”, or the like. The different versions of the polar-
  alternative, as illustrated in [10i], vary in the extent to which they convey such emotive
  meaning. In general, the less elliptical the form, the greater the emotive meaning is likely
  to be: compare Are you going or not? with the more insistent Are you going or aren’t you?
  Typically, however, the version where the second coordinate is interpolated within the
  first, as in [10ie], is the most hectoring.
 (b) Polar-alternative emphasises the exhaustiveness of the two alternatives
 [12] a. Was it good?                  b. Was it good or not?
 The answers to both polar [a] and polar-alternative [b] are simply It was good and It
 wasn’t good, but (no doubt because of the tendency for the negative It wasn’t good to
872       Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
         be interpreted as “It was bad” – see Ch. 9, §5) [a] will often receive such non-answer
         responses as It was okay, It wasn’t too bad, and the like. Such responses locate ‘it’ in
         the middle ground between good and bad. The polar-alternative can serve, then, to
         insist on a simple, unequivocal choice between ‘good’ and ‘not good’ – and again the
         emotive meaning of impatience or the like will be more evident in the less elliptical
         versions.
         (c) Polar version preferred when answers are of unequal status for the speaker
         [13] i Have you any idea how much these things cost?
              ii Will they agree to the proposal, do you think, or not?
             iii Is it the sixteenth today?
         I might use [i] rhetorically, to convey that I believe that you haven’t any idea of the
         cost: in this use (which is not the only one, of course) it would be a biased question,
         one where I am predisposed to one answer over another. In this case it would be very
         unnatural to add or not, for this would take away the rhetorical effect. Negative polar
         questions – e.g. Don’t you like it? – are always biased, and will never be pragmatically
         equivalent to polar-alternatives. The polar-alternative, by expressing both positive and
         negative propositions, tends to assign them equal status.
             In a case like [13ii] the effect is to give you full freedom to choose between them:
         it avoids any appearance of according greater likelihood to one answer. Especially in
         combination with the parenthetical do you think, the effect of the polar-alternative may
         then be to suggest a certain diffidence or deference to the addressee.
             Bias is not the only factor that can make the answers of unequal status. Consider
         [13iii], for example. I might say this when my concern is to find out what date it is,
         and in that case a “yes” answer gives me the desired information but a “no” does not
         (so that a co-operative response would go further: No, it’s the fifteenth, say). For this
         reason, the answers are of unequal value, and in such a context the polar-alternative
         version would be very unlikely. There are numerous other ways in which the an-
         swers might be of unequal status. To give just one, note that we say Are you awake?,
         not (normally) Are you awake or not? The latter suggests that positive and negative
         answers are on a par, but they are not. If you are awake you can answer Yes, but
         if you’re not you can’t answer No, so only one of the answers is a possible (true)
         response.","[891, 892]"
" The form of alternative questions
     The essential feature of alternative questions is the coordinator or which relates the
     alternatives. The or-coordination is normally prosodically marked by a rise on the first
     coordinate and a fall on the final one, as indicated in [7], where we put  after a word
     or phrase that is uttered with rising pitch and  after a word or phrase that is uttered
     with falling pitch:
 [7]        i Is it a boyor a girl ?                                 [closed interrogative]
           ii Is it genuineor is it a hoax?         [coordination of closed interrogatives]
          iii You’re staying here, or coming with us?                         [declarative]
          iv Teaor coffee?                                               [clause fragment]
     With multiple coordination the intermediate coordinates take rising intonation, like the
     first: Would you like orange juice, lemonade , or coke?
         Alternative questions usually have closed interrogative syntax. In [7i] the or-coordi-
     nation is within the clause, whereas in [ii] it is between clauses. In the latter case, then, we
     have two interrogative clauses but a single question. It is also possible for an alternative
     question to have the form of a declarative, as in [iii], or of a clause fragment, as in [iv].
     Prosodically marked declaratives, however, are much less readily used for alternative
     questions than for polar ones; this is no doubt because questions with declarative form
     are biased, and alternative questions tend to be neutral.6 Or in alternative and polar questions
     The coordinator or is an essential component of an alternative question, but it may also
     occur incidentally in a polar question: Will I be able to get some tea or coffee at the bus
     station? Here the answers are Yes, you will and No, you won’t: I’m not asking which drink
     is available but whether or not I’ll be able to get one or other of the drinks.
         In writing there will often be ambiguity between an alternative question and a polar
     question that happens to contain an or-coordination, but the two cases are distinguished
     in speech by the intonation. An alternative question, we have noted, has a rise on the first
     coordinate and a fall on the last: a polar question will not distinguish the coordinates in
     this way but will normally have a rising pitch on the last:
 [8]        i Are you free on Tuesday or Wednesday?                                                   [alternative]
           ii Are you free on Tuesday or Wednesday?                                                          [polar]
     The answers to the alternative question [i] are I am free on Tuesday and I am free on
     Wednesday. The polar question [ii] is equivalent to Are you free on Tuesday or Wednesday,
     or not?, its answers being Yes, I am free on Tuesday or Wednesday and No, I’m not free
     on Tuesday or Wednesday. It should again be borne in mind, however, that while the
     answers to the alternative and polar questions are sharply distinct, the responses may 6
     A special case is where the alternatives are identical: Is it hot, or is it hot? This serves as an indirect emphatic
     statement, “It is remarkably hot”.
870      Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
        be less so. A co-operative addressee might respond to the polar question with Yes, I’m
        free on Tuesday, giving more specific information than is actually asked for.
        The ambiguity which is found in the written form Are you free on Tuesday or Wednesday? is
        seen also when the coordination is between clauses:
       [9]      Have you moved or are you about to move?
        The answers to the alternative question are I have moved and I am about to move, and those
        to the polar question are Yes, I have moved or I am about to move (unlikely as a response: you
        would generally give more specific information) and No, I have not moved nor am I about to
        move. The example is taken from a bank statement, where the continuation – If so, please call
        us on the number below – makes clear that the polar interpretation is intended, but it is equally
        easy to imagine contexts where the alternative one applies. Again, the ambiguity would be
        resolved in speech by the intonation.
        One grammatical difference between the two kinds of question is that or cannot be
        paired with either when it is the marker of an alternative question. Are you free on either
        Tuesday or Wednesday?, for example, is unambiguously polar. This explains the anomaly
        of examples like Would you prefer to watch with the light either on or off? or (to an
        expectant mother) Are you hoping for either a boy or a girl? – the either forces a polar,
        yes/no, interpretation which conflicts with normal assumptions that there are no other
        possibilities than those expressed.","[889, 890]"
"        5
            Other terms for polar question include ‘yes/no question’, ‘general question’, ‘total question’, ‘nexus-question’.
                                                                                    § 4.4 Alternative questions             869
     The propositional content of an alternative question is, or is logically equivalent to, a dis-
     junction of propositions, disjunction being the relation expressed by or (see Ch. 15, §2.2.1).
     Each of these propositions gives the content of one of the answers. The propositional content
     of Is it alive or dead?, for example, is “It is alive or dead”, which is logically equivalent to “It
     is alive or it is dead”.","[888, 889]"
"       Responses to other kinds of speech act
        Yes and no are used in response to statements in a similar but not identical way:
       [8]    i A: She did very well.             B: Yes (she did ).      No she didn’t.
             ii A: She didn’t do very well.       B: Yes she did.         No (she didn’t).
        In [i] the disagreeing negative response would not normally be reduced to No, and in
        [ii] the disagreeing positive answer could not be reduced to yes. It is in fact here possible
        to say yes to express agreement with the negative statement: “Yes, you’re right”.
            Following directives, yes and no can be used to express intention to comply with a
        positive and negative directive. No is also used to indicate refusal to comply with a positive
        one, but yes is not an idiomatic way of refusing to comply with a negative directive:
       [9]     i A: Remember to lock up.          B: Yes (I will ).
              ii A: Don’t forget to lock up.      B: No (I won’t).
             iii A: Tell me who did it.           B: No (I won’t).
             iv A: Don’t tell them I did it.      B: ?Yes I will.
        In [iv] B would more likely say just I will (tell them), or words to that effect. With
        directives expressed by certain kinds of interrogative clause (a type of indirect speech
        act, in the sense of Ch. 10, §9.6.1), a response may reflect the literal question meaning
        or the indirect directive meaning. Thus in response to Would you mind coming a little
        earlier next week, I might respond No of course not, I’ll come around six (“No of course
        I wouldn’t mind”), or Yes of course, I’ll come around six (“Yes of course I’ll come a
        little earlier”).
                                                                                § 7.2 Anaphoric so and not          849
  Idiomatic negative answers with not and no
      There are a number of idiomatic phrases that express an emphatic negative response to
      a question or other speech act. Some have not, others the determinative no:
  [10] i Not for all the tea in China!                Not likely!              Not on a bet! (AmE)
          Not in a million years!                     Not on your life!        Not on your nelly! (BrE)
       ii No fear!                                    No chance!               No way! 28
7.2 Anaphoric so and not
      With predicates that take so as the anaphoric pro-form for a positive clausal complement,
      not is used as a pro-form for a negative (cf. Ch. 17, §7.7.2). We illustrate with answers to
      questions, but they occur more widely than this.
  [11]        question                         positive answer                 negative answer
                                              I believe/think so.              I believe/think not.
              Are they reliable?              I was told so.                   I was told not.
                                              It seems so.                     It seems not.
      Not (like so) is here functioning as complement and marks non-verbal negation: it is not
      modifying the verb.
         What accompanies the pro-form need not be a full matrix clause; a preposed AdvP
      functioning as clause adjunct will serve as well:                                              Most definitely so.
  [12]                                        Apparently so.                   Apparently not.
              Is the city beautiful?
                                                                               Most definitely not.
      Other adjuncts such as PPs are permitted with not but not so:
                                              ∗
  [13]                                         On the whole so.                On the whole not.
                                              ∗
               Does it rain much?              So in the winter.               Not in the winter.
                                              ∗
                                               Usually so this early.          Usually not this early.
         Not can also introduce anaphorically reduced clauses used in response to other types
      of speech act or following a negative clause:
  [14] i A: I think you should leave now.      B: Not without my money.
       ii I won’t go, not even if they beg me.
      iii There aren’t many wild rhinoceroses left, not in Africa or in Asia.
      Not is here understood respectively as “I won’t leave”, “I won’t go”, and “there aren’t many
      rhinoceroses left”.
 28
      No way can also be integrated into clause structure as an emphatic negator, as in No way is that a diamond!
      The original manner meaning has here been bleached away, so that we understand “That is emphatically not
      a diamond”.

1 Type as a grammatical system of the clause The five major categories
  Clause type is the grammatical system whose five major terms are illustrated in:
 [1]     i You are generous.                                                     [declarative]
        ii Are you generous?                                            [closed interrogative]
       iii How generous are you?                                         [open interrogative]
       iv How generous you are!                                                 [exclamative]
        v Be generous.                                                           [imperative]
 Characteristic use and general definitions
  Each of the categories is associated with a characteristic use as follows:
 [2]       clause type              characteristic use
         i declarative              statement
        ii closed interrogative     closed question
       iii open interrogative       open question
       iv exclamative               exclamatory statement
        v imperative                directive
  A closed question is one with a closed set of answers: for example, the answers to [1ii] are
  just “Yes” and “No”. By contrast, [1iii] has any number of possible answers, and is therefore
  an open question; similarly with Who attended the meeting?, and so on. In [2iv] we have
  used ‘exclamatory statement’ rather than the more familiar ‘exclamation’, because an
  exclamatory meaning can be added to any of the use categories, but the special syntactic
  construction shown in [1iv] is associated just with a particular kind of statement. For
  example, the exclamatory command Get the hell out of here or the exclamatory question
  What on earth are you doing? belong syntactically with [1v] and [1iii] respectively, not
  with [1iv]. ‘Directive’ in [2v] is a cover term for requests, commands, instructions, and
  the like; traditional grammars tend to use the term ‘command’, but this is far too narrow
  and specific for our purposes if understood in its everyday sense.
     The correlation shown in [2] provides the basis for general definitions of the clause
  type categories:
 [3]      Imperative clause is a grammatically distinct class of clause whose members are
          characteristically used to issue directives.
  And similarly for the others.
854         Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
       Complex relation between form and meaning
           We have spoken of ‘characteristic’ use because, as is so often the case, the correlation
           between major categories of grammatical form and categories of meaning or use is by
           no means one-to-one. Compare, for example:
       [4]                                                                    clause type                    use
                  i Passengers are requested to remain seated.                declarative                    directive
                 ii Would you mind opening the door for me.                   closed interrogative           directive
                iii Sleep well.                                               imperative                     wish
           Examples [i] and [ii] illustrate conventional ways of expressing a polite request, a kind of
           directive, but syntactically they belong to the same structural class as You are generous and
           Are you generous? respectively. And though [iii] belongs syntactically with Be generous it
           is not used to tell or ask somebody to do something, but to express a wish. Numerous
           further examples of this and other kinds will emerge during the course of the chapter. It is
           essential therefore to maintain a sharp conceptual distinction between the grammatical
           clause types and the categories of meaning or use – between declarative and statement,
           imperative and directive, and so on. The situation is closely parallel to that which obtains
           in the area of tense (form) and time (meaning), but whereas it is standard practice for
           grammars to distinguish terminologically between tense and time, many use ‘question’
           both for form (our ‘interrogative’) and for meaning. Again we emphasise, therefore, that
           interrogatives aren’t always used as questions, and not all questions have the syntactic
           form of interrogatives.","[868, 869, 870, 871, 872, 873, 874]"
"        Polar, alternative, and variable echo questions
         Echo questions are predominantly of either the polar or the variable kind, but alternative
         echoes are also possible:
         [51]          stimulus                        echo question
                  i A: She’s leaving on Saturday.   B: She’s leaving on Saturday?              [polar]
                 ii A: He gave it to Anne.          B: He gave it to Anne or Anna?       [alternative]
                iii A: He’s proposing to resign.    B: He’s proposing to what?              [variable]
             The polar echo question prototypically repeats the stimulus but with a rising into-
         nation imposed on it; like ordinary polar questions, it has Yes and No as answers. The
         alternative echo question substitutes an or-coordination for part of the stimulus, and
         each answer will include just one of the coordinates; it generally has the rise + fall in-
         tonation pattern of ordinary alternative questions. The variable question, which – like
         the polar – prototypically also has rising intonation, substitutes an echo question word
         expressing a variable for part of the stimulus, and the answers involve replacing the
         variable by its possible values.",[906]
" 4 Kinds of question4.1 Question as a semantic and as a pragmatic category
  Semantic questions and their answers
   The term ‘question’ is commonly used at both the semantic and pragmatic levels. At
   the semantic level, a question is distinguished by the fact that it defines a set of logically
   possible answers:
  [1]          question                          answers
          i a. Have you seen it?              b. I have seen it. I haven’t seen it.
         ii a. Who broke it?                  b. I broke it. Kim broke it. The priest broke it.
                                                 One of her children broke it . . .
   Instead of saying I have seen it in answer to [ia], I might say Yes or I have or Yes, I have
   or Yes, I’ve seen it, and so on. Although these are different in form they are equivalent,
866      Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
        and we will regard them as (expressing) the same answer. Similarly for the negatives:
        I have not seen it; I have not; I haven’t; No; No, I haven’t. These all count as the same
        answer. It is in this sense of the term that we can say that [ia] defines a closed set of
        just two possible answers. Questions like [iia], on the other hand, define in principle an
        open set of answers: there are indefinitely many others besides those given in [iib]. It
        was this distinction that provided the basis for general definitions of closed and open
        interrogatives.","[885, 886]"
"
      4.6 Direction questions
        Distinguished from information questions by the illocutionary force
         of the answers
         The great majority of questions are information questions: when used as inquiries they
         seek to elicit information. The characteristic illocutionary force of their answers is that of a
                                                                                § 4.6 Direction questions    877
     statement. There is also, however, a kind of question whose answers characteristically have
     the force of directives. They seek not information but direction, and we accordingly call
     them direction questions.9 The distinction applies to all three of the polar, alternative,
     and variable categories of question. Compare:
 [26]            information question                           direction question
            i a. Did he open the window?                     b. %Shall I open the window?          [polar]
           ii a. Did he do it then or later?                 b. %Shall I do it now or later? [alternative]
          iii a. When did he come back?                      b. %When shall we come back?       [variable]
     The answers to the information questions are He opened the window /He didn’t open the
     window; He did it then / He did it later; He came back at six (or whenever): these would
     all have the force of statements. The answers to the direction questions are Open the
     window / Don’t open the window; Do it now / Do it later; Come back at six (etc.): and
     these would have the force of directives. With the polar questions, Yes and No could of
     course be used in either case, but they would still have the statement force in response to
     [a] and directive force in response to [b]. We annotate the [b] examples with ‘% ’ because
     some varieties use will in place of shall here.","[896, 897]"
"       Negative concord in non-standard dialects
        The clearest case of negative concord in English is found in non-standard dialects. This
        book is of course a grammar of Standard English, but the negative concord phenomenon
        is so widespread and salient that it deserves some mention here.
        In many dialects, ranging from Cockney (spoken in the East End of London, England) to
        African American Vernacular English (AAVE, formerly known as Black English Vernacular,
        spoken in segregated African American communities in the USA), the absolute negators no,
        no one, nothing, etc., are used in negative clauses where the standard dialect has the NPIs any,
        anyone, anything, etc.:
       [6]          non-standard                               standard
               i a. !He didn’t say nothin’.                 b. He didn’t say anything.
              ii a. !You gonna spend your whole life        b. Are you going to spend your whole life
                    [not trustin’ nobody]?                     [not trusting anybody]?
             iii a. !Nobody here didn’t point no gun at     b. Nobody here pointed any gun at
                    nobody.                                    anybody.
        Each clause contains just one semantic negation and in the standard versions it is marked by
        a single negator. In the non-standard versions, however, it is marked by verbal negation and
        also on all the existentially quantified elements in the clause. We accordingly have negative
        concord between the verb and these elements.
            Non-standard clauses with negative concord are characteristically homonymous with
        standard dialect clauses containing multiple semantic negation, such as [2v] and [3i] above.
        Standard He didn’t say nothing means “He did say something (it’s not true that he said
        nothing”). The bracketed clause of [6iia] could likewise be used in the standard dialect
        with the meaning “not being in a state of refusing to trust anyone”. In principle [6iiia]
        could be used in Standard English to express a meaning containing four semantic negations,
                                     § 7 Positive and negative polarity in responses and anaphora                     847
      though in practice of course it would be far too complex to process. There are, however, some
      constructions – such as imperative Don’t nobody move! – that cannot be used in the standard
      dialect to express multiple semantic negation.25
          There is an extremely widespread tendency among Standard English speakers to regard
      dialects with negative concord as ‘illogical’ and ‘inferior’. It is argued that by a rule of logic
      two negatives cancel each other out to make a positive. Thus just as It isn’t the case that she
      didn’t move (or She didn’t not move) is equivalent to She moved, it is argued that He didn’t say
      nothing is a double negative that can only mean “He said something” and hence should not
      be used to express the opposite of that meaning. But such an argument is completely invalid.
      The rule of logic that two negatives are equivalent to a positive applies to logical forms, not
      to grammatical forms. It applies to semantic negation, not to the grammatical markers of
      negation. And as far as the [a] examples of [6] are concerned, there is only a single semantic
      negation, so the rule of logic doesn’t apply: it is completely irrelevant.26 The pattern in the
      non-standard dialect is similar to the one found in the standard dialect of Italian, French,
      Spanish, Polish, Russian, and many other languages. For example, Italian non means “not”
      and nessuno means “nobody”, but the meaning of Non ti credo nessuno is “Nobody believes
      you”, not “Nobody doesn’t believe you”. Here again, then, we have two negative words marking
      a single semantic negation, just as we do in the non-standard English dialects. There is no
      more reason to condemn the latter as illogical than there is to condemn Italian, French, and
      so on. The difference between the [a] and [b] versions of [6] is a matter of grammar, not
      logic, and neither set can be regarded as intrinsically superior to the other.
          Despite its non-standard character every experienced user of English needs to be passively
      acquainted with the negative concord construction in order to be able to understand English
      in such ordinary contexts as film soundtracks, TV dramas, popular songs, and many everyday
      conversations. Those who claim that negative concord is evidence of ignorance and illiteracy
      are wrong; it is a regular and widespread feature of non-standard dialects of English across
      the world. Someone who thinks the song title I can’t get no satisfaction means “It is impossible
      for me to lack satisfaction” does not know English.277 Positive and negative polarity in responses and anaphora7.1 Answers to polar questions and comparable responses
 Yes and no answers
      Yes and no serve as markers of positive and negative polarity in answers to ques-
      tions. They may stand alone, or combine with a clause that expresses the answer more 25
    The same applies to the construction without + no (corresponding to standard without + any), as in !Give
    me a large cheeseburger without no onions. And also to the construction with negative concord between the
    verb and an approximate negator of degree, as in !I can’t hardly see (corresponding to standard I can hardly
    see).
 26
    Given that the term ‘double negative’ is strongly associated with the semantic rule whereby two negatives
    do cancel each other out, it is an unsatisfactory term for the negative concord construction. It is in any case
    inappropriate because there is no limitation to two, as we have seen.
 27
    Negative concord was common in Old English and became virtually obligatory in the Middle English period.
    Its decline in the standard written language in the early Modern period may have had much to do with a
    nascent prescriptive tradition and its conscious comparison of English with Latin. In the nineteenth century
    negative concord re-emerged as a literary mark of non-standard usage, the gap in the historical record almost
    certainly concealing a continuous but largely unrecorded tradition in many spoken dialects.
848      Chapter 9 Negation
        explicitly:                                                     
       [7]    i a. A: Is this car yours?          B:
                                                     Yes (it is).         No (it isn’t).
                b. A: Isn’t this car yours?       B:                                                     
             ii a. A: He has gone, hasn’t he?     B:
                                                     Yes (he has).        No (he hasn’t).
                b. A: He hasn’t gone, has he?     B:
        The choice between yes and no depends simply on the polarity of the answer – not, for
        example, on agreement vs disagreement with what may be suggested by the question.
        Polar questions, especially negative ones, may be biased, indicating the questioner’s
        predisposition to think that one or other answer is the right one, but that has no bearing
        on the choice between yes and no. In [ib], for example, the appropriate response is yes
        if the car is B’s and no if it isn’t, irrespective of what A appears to expect is the case.
        Similarly with answers to tag questions, as in [ii].
            ∗
             Yes it isn’t and ∗No it is are thus ungrammatical as single clauses. In Yes it is and No
        it isn’t, the yes and no can be regarded as a special type of adjunct, a polarity adjunct,
        which agrees in polarity with the clause – a further case of polarity concord in English.
        The adjunct can also be placed at the end of the clause, with prosodic detachment: It is,
        yes and It isn’t, no. A response to [7i] with the form No, it’s Kim’s would not of course
        violate the polarity concord rule, because here we have not a single clause but a sequence
        of two, just as we do in No it’s not mine, it’s Kim’s.
            One respect in which the agreement vs disagreement factor is relevant concerns the
        choice between single-word and expanded responses. Suppose you ask Didn’t you post
        the letter after all, then?, indicating that you think I didn’t. If in fact I did post it, I would
        normally say Yes I did, not just Yes.","[866, 867, 868]"
"          The closed type
           Closed interrogatives in the ungoverned construction are a subset of those found in the
           governed one: they must contain an or-coordination. Compare:
           [74]          governed                                     ungoverned
                    i a. I’m buying it [regardless of whether     b. ∗I’m buying it [whether we can
                         we can afford it].                           afford it].
                   ii a. I’m buying it [regardless of whether     b. I’m buying it [whether we can afford
                         we can afford it or not].                    it or not].
                  iii a. He’ll resign [regardless of whether      b. He’ll resign [whether he is found
                         he is found guilty or innocent].             guilty or innocent].
              Closed interrogatives characteristically express questions that can be distinguished
           as polar or alternative on the basis of how they define the set of answers (cf. Ch. 10,
           §§4.3–5). Compare the main clauses:
           [75] i Can we afford it?                                                                  [polar]                                                            
                ii Can we afford it or not?
                                                                                                [alternative]
               iii Will he be found guilty or innocent?
           The answers to a polar question consist of the proposition expressed in the question
           itself together with its polar opposite. The answers to the question in [i], for example,
           are “We can afford it” and “We can’t afford it”. The answers to an alternative question are
           all expressed in the question itself: it contains an or-coordination where each coordinate
           represents one answer. In the case of [iii], for example, the answers are “He will be found
           guilty” and “He will be found innocent”. Example [ii] belongs with [iii] rather than [i]
           in that the answers are given by the coordinates linked by or, just as they are in [iii].
                                                                     § 14.6.2 The ungoverned construction                 763
 The constraint that excludes [74ib] while allowing [74iib/iiib] can therefore be stated as
 follows:
 [76] The closed interrogative in the ungoverned construction must correspond to an
        alternative question.
     The presence of an or-coordination is not itself sufficient. Will one or other of your col-
     leagues be elected?, for example, can only express a polar question: the answers are “Yes,
     one or other of them will be elected” and “No, one or other of them won’t be elected”, not
     “One of them will be elected” and “∗ Other of them will be elected”. The corresponding
     ungoverned exhaustive conditional is therefore excluded: ∗I’ll be happy whether one or
     other of your colleagues is elected.
        It should also be noted that in the alternative question type, the interrogative subordi-
     nator can only be whether, not if. In conditionals, if can only have its primary, conditional
     meaning, so that I won’t serve on the committee if you’re on it or if I’d be expected to chair it
     does not belong to the exhaustive conditional construction. If is excluded from the gov-
     erned construction too, but that follows from the general rule that whether is normally
     required in closed interrogatives functioning as complement of a preposition.","[782, 783]"

      6.2 Q–A presuppositions of polar questions
         The presuppositions of polar questions are arrived at in a similar way:
         [3]     i Has the clock stopped?                                              [polar question]
                ii “The clock has stopped”; “The clock hasn’t stopped”                        [answers]
               iii “(Either) the clock has stopped or it hasn’t”                      [presupposition]
         To presuppose that [i] has a true answer is again to presuppose the disjunction of the
         answers listed in [ii], i.e. to presuppose [iii]. The Q–A presupposition of a polar question
         is therefore the disjunction of the corresponding statement and its polar opposite.
             This applies equally when the question is negative:
         [4]     i Didn’t she see them?                                                [polar question]
                ii “She didn’t see them”; “She did see them”                                  [answers]
               iii “(Either) she didn’t see them or she did”                          [presupposition]
         We have seen that negative questions are biased, but bias is perfectly consistent with
         presupposition. The presupposition is that one of the answers is true; the bias goes
         beyond this and favours one rather than the other as the true one.
             The presuppositions in [3] and [4] are necessarily true: they are logical truths, tautolo-
         gies. This will always be the case with polar questions: the disjunction of any proposition
         and its polar opposite is necessarily true. Polar questions clearly differ in this respect
         from alternative ones: [1], for example, is obviously not a logical truth. It should not
         be thought, however, that this property of polar presuppositions makes them vacuous:
         from a pragmatic point of view they can be of considerable significance. This may be
         illustrated by such an example as:
         [5]    i Are you telling the truth?                                           [polar question]
               ii “(Either) you are telling the truth or you are not”                 [presupposition]
         The presupposition is what I take for granted, and the significance here is that the
         presupposition is so weak – it doesn’t go beyond a mere tautology. In asking [5i] I take
         for granted the truth of [ii], but in so doing conspicuously fail to take for granted the
         truth of the proposition “You are telling the truth”. The question entertains the possibility
         that you are not telling the truth, thereby casting doubt on your veracity. At the direct
         level [i] is clearly a question, not an accusation, but is not uncommon for such questions
         to be interpreted as indirect accusations.
                                              § 6.3 Q–A presuppositions of variable questions     899
6.3 Q–A presuppositions of variable questions
   The presuppositions of variable questions cannot be derived in quite so simple a way as
   with alternative and polar questions. This is because the set of answers is prototypically
   open-ended: we shall not therefore derive the presupposition by taking the disjunction
   of the possible answers. Instead we derive it by substituting an appropriate indefinite
   phrase for the variable in the open proposition expressed in the question:
   [6]     i Who wrote the editorial?                                     [variable question]
          ii “Person x wrote the editorial”                               [open proposition]
         iii “Someone wrote the editorial”                                  [presupposition]
   We have seen that the answers to a variable question assign values to the variable(s) in the
   open proposition. To presuppose that [6i] has a right answer, therefore, is to presuppose
   that there is a true proposition in which a value is assigned to the variable in [ii] – and
   to presuppose this is to presuppose [iii]. Note that the latter does not constitute an
   answer to the question, and to give it as a response would be clearly unco-operative.
   This is precisely because it does not provide any information beyond that which the
   speaker presents as already established. Thus [iii] no more constitutes an answer to [i]
   in set [6] than it does in sets [2–4]. With alternative and polar questions an answer
   must be more specific than the presupposition by selecting one of the coordinates;
   with variable questions it must be more specific by genuinely providing a value for the
   variable.
      It will be noted that in [6ii] the variable x is attached to ‘person’ instead of standing
   on its own, as in the formulations which, for simplicity of presentation, we have been
   using hitherto. ‘Person’ is needed to show that the variable ranges only over the set of
   persons: #The lawnmower wrote the editorial, for example, is not a possible answer to
   [6i]. ‘Person’, of course, is part of the meaning of who, and is encapsulated also in that
   of someone, which appears in the presupposition. For when, a comparable schema is
   given in:
   [7]     i When did they move to Edinburgh?                              [variable question]
          ii “They moved to Edinburgh at time x”                           [open proposition]
         iii “They moved to Edinburgh at some time”                          [presupposition]
   A detailed account of the presuppositions of variable questions must therefore draw on
   a description of the individual interrogative words: we take this up in §7 below.","[918, 919]"
" Occurrence in contexts that are non-affirmative but positive
  Negatives constitute the most central type of non-affirmative context, but we have noted
  that NPIs can occur in certain types of positive clause, such as interrogatives – this is
  precisely why we talk in terms of non-affirmative contexts rather than simply negative
  ones. These positive non-affirmative contexts all have various semantic or pragmatic
  links to negatives. There are, however, differences among the NPIs with respect to how
828    Chapter 9 Negation
      strong or close these links need to be. Such differences can be illustrated by considering
      the non-affirmative context provided by closed interrogatives.
      NPIs in closed interrogatives
      Other things being equal, questions expressed by positive closed interrogatives are neutral
      as opposed to biased (cf. Ch. 10, §4.7). That is, they do not indicate any predisposition
      on the part of the questioner to think that one answer is more likely than the other. Now
      the inclusion of certain NPIs in the question has no effect on this neutrality, but with
      others bias towards a negative answer is introduced. Compare:
      [13] i a. Did they have a dog?               b. Did they have any money?
           ii a. Has she been to Paris?            b. Has she ever been to Paris?
          iii a. Did they help him?                b. Did they lift a finger to help him?
      The possible answers to [ia] may be expressed as Yes they did have a dog and No they
      didn’t have a dog: as we have said, there is no indication that one or other of these is
      expected to be the right answer. The answers to [ib] (omitting henceforth the yes and
      no) are They had some money and They didn’t have any money, and again the question
      is quite neutral. The inclusion of any in the question does not indicate that the answer
      containing any is expected. The absence of any indication that a positive answer is
      favoured is sufficient to license the NPI any: this is the default existential quantifier for
      polar questions. Similarly, both questions in [ii] are neutral as between the answers She
      has been to Paris (at some time) and She hasn’t (ever) been to Paris. This is not so in [iii].
      While [iiia] is of course neutral, [iiib] is not: it is oriented towards the negative answer
      They didn’t lift a finger to help him. The form of the question is such that the positive
      answer would be #They lifted a finger to help him, but since this (in the sense “They helped
      him”) is anomalous, the question doesn’t cater directly for a positive answer and hence
      indicates bias towards a negative one. The same applies to most of the other items in
      [5iv–v].
      Pragmatic nature of strength contrasts
      It is important to emphasise that the difference between (say) any or ever on the one
      hand and budge or lift a finger or in ages on the other is not a syntactic one. We are
      not saying that the former can occur in positive interrogatives while the latter cannot.
      The difference, rather, is pragmatic, having to do with the conditions under which they
      can be used in the expression of questions and with the interpretation of the resulting
      questions.
          Take, for example, the phrase in ages, as in I haven’t tasted truffles in ages. This is not
      easily contextualised in an interrogative: ?Have you tasted truffles in ages? would not be
      a highly appropriate way of simply asking someone whether it had been a very long
      time since they last tasted truffles. However, it might well be found in a context that
      was strongly biased in a direction suggesting a negative answer, as in [14i]. Similarly, the
      occurrence of the verb budge is almost entirely limited to negative clauses but one might
      encounter it in a biased context like [14ii].
      [14] i I don’t think you know anything about truffles or any other gourmet foods. Do you
              eat truffles regularly? Have you even so much as tasted truffles in ages?
           ii Did you budge an inch to let anyone else sit down? Not you; you just sat there hogging
              the whole couch as usual.
                                        § 4.2 Positively-oriented polarity-sensitive items (PPIs)      829
4.2 Positively-oriented polarity-sensitive items (PPIs)
   The class of PPIs is somewhat smaller than that of NPIs. The main members are listed in
   [15], while [16] provides a sample of positive examples contrasted with their inadmissible
   negative counterparts:
   [15] i some, somebody, someone, something, somewhere, somehow, somewhat
         ii the paucal determinatives a few, a little, several, various
       iii the degree adverbs pretty, fairly, quitep , farp
        iv aspectual already, still
         v connective so, too, as well
        vi the modal idioms would rather, would sooner, would as soon
       vii illocutionary I guess
   [16] i a. They made some mistakes                    b. ∗They didn’t make some mistakes.
         ii a. It’s pretty big.                         b. ∗It isn’t pretty big.
       iii a. It is still a mystery why he ran off.     b. ∗It isn’t still a mystery why he ran off.
        iv a. Kim saw it, and so did Pat.               b. ∗Kim saw it, but not so did Pat.
         v a. This one is far better.                   b. ∗This one isn’t far better.
        vi a. I would rather die.                       b. ∗I wouldn’t rather die.
       vii a. I guess I agree.                          b. ∗I don’t guess I agree.
   As a PPI quite means “fairly”: with the sense “completely” quite is not polarity-sensitive
   (cf. That’s quite right ∼ That’s not quite right). The far that acts as a PPI modifies
   comparative expressions for the most part, and means roughly “considerably”; as a
   measure of distance it is not polarity sensitive (cf. They live / don’t live far away). I guess
   qualifies as a PPI where it serves to indicate the illocutionary force of the utterance: it is
   not polarity-sensitive when guess has its literal meaning (as in I don’t guess what’s in my
   presents, I wait to be surprised when I open them on Christmas Day).","[847, 848, 849]"

4.7 Biased questions
  The distinction between neutral questions and biased questions
      A biased question is one where the speaker is predisposed to accept one particular an-
      swer as the right one. A neutral question lacks such bias towards one answer rather
      than another: it is the default category on this dimension. The distinction between
      neutral and biased questions applies primarily to polar questions. Compare, for
      example:
   [32] i Did you get any annuity, superannuation, or other pension?                                   [neutral]
        ii Doesn’t she like it?                                                                         [biased]
      Example [i] is taken from an income tax form: it is addressed individually to all those
      filling in the form, and for any individual there is no expectation on the part of the
      ‘speaker’ (the Income Tax Commissioner) that the answer will be positive rather than
      negative, or vice versa. A plausible context for [ii], though not the only one, is that her
      behaviour or her remarks suggest that she doesn’t like it: I ask the question to confirm
      whether this is so. In such a context the question is biased towards the negative answer
      She doesn’t like it.12
 12
      Alternative terms for ‘neutral’ and ‘biased’ are ‘open’ and ‘conducive’ respectively.
880        Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
      4.7.1 Kinds and degrees of bias
       (a) Epistemic bias
           There are different kinds of bias. It may be simply a matter of the speaker thinking,
           expecting, or knowing that one answer is the right one. We will refer to this kind of bias
           as epistemic, a term whose primary application is in the closely related field of modality.
           In the contextualisation of [32ii] suggested above, for example, the bias towards the
           negative answer will be an epistemic one.       (b) Deontic bias
           Alternatively, it might be a matter of the speaker judging that one answer ought to be
           the right one. Again we will take over a term from the field of modality, and refer to this
           kind of bias as deontic. It is seen in the natural interpretations of:
          [33] i You’re surely not going to let them get away with outrageous behaviour like that, are
                  you?
               ii Aren’t you ashamed of yourselves?
          In [i] there is a deontic bias towards a negative answer: I convey a judgement that you
          ought not to let them get away with their outrageous behaviour. Example [ii] shows a
          deontic bias towards a positive answer: you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. But at
          the same time, [ii] has an epistemic bias towards a negative answer: it appears from your
          behaviour that you are not ashamed of yourselves.       (c) Desiderative bias
           A third kind of bias, not greatly different from the deontic, is that where the speaker
           wants one answer to be the right one – desiderative bias, as we shall call it. For example,
           when I indirectly request something by means of such a question as
          [34]    Can I have some more ice-cream?
          there will be a desiderative bias towards a positive answer: I want a Yes answer. The
          negative epistemic bias of [32ii] could also be accompanied by a positive desiderative
          bias. This could be the case in a context where it refers to something I am responsi-
          ble for (a painting, say, that I have painted or chosen): I want her to like it but think
          she doesn’t.","[899, 900]"
"       Polar-alternative questions
        A special type of alternative question has the alternatives consisting of a positive and its
        negative counterpart. Questions of this kind are logically equivalent to polar questions,
        and we refer to them as polar-alternative questions:
       [10] i a. Are you ready or are you not ready?
               b. Are you ready or aren’t you ready?
               c. Are you ready or aren’t you?                                      [polar-alternative]
               d. Are you ready or not?
               e. Are you, or are you not, ready?
            ii Are you ready?                                                                    [polar]
                                                                  § 4.4 Alternative questions      871
  As shown in [i], the second coordinate can be reduced by the omission of repeated
  material, and its position relative to the first can be varied, as in [ie]. With embedded
  polar-alternative questions there is also the possibility of having or not adjacent to the
  subordinator whether : They want to know whether or not you’re ready.
  The questions in [10] are logically equivalent in that they define the same set of answers.
  They do so, however, in different ways. Polar [ii] expresses a single proposition and the
  answers are provided by this and its polar opposite, whereas the polar-alternatives in [i]
  express two propositions, each of which provides an answer. The distinction between polar,
  alternative, and variable questions is based on the way they define the set of answers, and
  in accordance with the definitions given above, therefore, [i] and [ii] belong to different
  categories despite their logical equivalence. The term ‘polar-alternative’ is to be understood
  as denoting a subclass of alternative questions.
      Apart from the issue of how the answers are derived, there are two other respects in which
  [10i] behave like alternative questions rather than polar ones. These involve the subordinate
  constructions illustrated in:
 [11] i a. I wonder/doubt whether it is alive.                                           [polar]
         b. I wonder/∗doubt whether it is alive or dead.                           [alternative]
         c. I wonder/∗doubt whether it is alive or not.                      [polar-alternative]
      ii a. ∗I’m marrying her whether you like her.                                      [polar]
         b. I’m marrying her whether you like her or hate her.                     [alternative]
         c. I’m marrying her whether you like her or not.                    [polar-alternative]
  While verbs like wonder license interrogative complements expressing all three kinds of
  question, doubt accepts only the polar type: the polar-alternative is excluded just as other
  alternative questions are (see Ch. 11, §5.3.3). Conversely, the ungoverned exhaustive condi-
  tional construction [ii] excludes the polar type, while allowing polar-alternatives as well as
  other alternative questions (see Ch. 11, §5.3.6).","[890, 891]"
"
10 Clause type and illocutionary force  As a technical term, ‘clause type’ applies to that dimension of clause structure contrasting
  declaratives, interrogatives, imperatives, etc. The major categories are illustrated in:
  [1]     i declarative                   She is a good player.
         ii closed interrogative          Is she a good player ?
        iii open interrogative            How good a player is she ?
        iv exclamative                    What a good player she is !
         v imperative                     Play well !
      We distinguish systematically between categories of syntactic form and categories of
  meaning or use. For example, You’re leaving ? (spoken with rising intonation) is syntac-
  tically a declarative but would be used to ask a question.
      A question defines a set of possible answers. On one dimension we distinguish between
  polar questions (Is this yours? – with answers Yes and No), alternative questions (Is this
  Kim’s or Pat’s? – in the interpretation where the answers are Kim’s and Pat’s), and variable
  questions (Whose is this ? – where the answers specify a value for the variable in the open
  proposition “This is x ’s”).
      Making a statement, asking a question, issuing an order, etc., are different kinds of
  speech act. More specifically, when I make a statement by saying This is Kim’s, say, my
  utterance has the illocutionary force of a statement. The illocutionary force typically
  associated with imperative clauses is called directive, a term which covers request, order,
  command, entreaty, instruction, and so on. There are, however, many different kinds of
  illocutionary force beyond those associated with the syntactic categories shown in [1].
  For example, the declarative I promise to be home by six would generally be used with
  the force of a promise, We apologise for the delay with the force of an apology, and
  so on.
62      Chapter 2 Syntactic overview
      Indirect speech acts
       Illocutionary meaning is often conveyed indirectly, by means of an utterance which if
       taken at face value would have a different force. Consider, for example, Would you like to
       close the window. Syntactically, this is a closed interrogative, and in its literal interpretation
       it has the force of an inquiry (with Yes and No as answers). In practice, however, it is
       most likely to be used as a directive, a request to close the door. Indirect speech acts are
       particularly common in the case of directives: in many circumstances it is considered
       more polite to issue indirect directives than direct ones (such as imperative Close the
       window).","[81, 82]"

   This provides further evidence against saying that or expresses exclusive disjunction: if ‘P or Q ’ has “not both P
   and Q” as part of its meaning, but should be inappropriate in ‘P or Q but not both’, for it implies contrast (§2.5).
   The implicature can also be cancelled by metalinguistic negation (as opposed to logical negation: Ch. 9, §1.2),
   as in They didn’t appoint Kim OR Pat, they appointed BOTH ; metalinguistic negation of inclusive disjunction
   differs from logical negation of exclusive disjunction in that it doesn’t allow situations corresponding to [14iv].
17
   In a less likely interpretation the “not both” implicature applies, accompanied by an implication of ignorance –
   e.g., for [ii], “They are obtainable at one or other of Coles and Woolworths, but I don’t know (can’t remember)
   which”.
1298            Chapter 15 Coordination and supplementation
          Or in questions
               One special case where or-coordination is interpreted exclusively is the alternative ques-
               tion (Ch. 10, §4.4). In this type of question (which has an intonational rise on the initial
               coordinate, and fall on the final one) or is essential, whereas when it appears in other
               types of question it is merely incidental:
           [20]            without OR                      with OR
                      i a. [not possible: or essential] b. Would you like tea  or coffee ?                  [alternative]
                     ii a. Would you like a drink ? b. Would you like tea or coffee ?                             [polar]
                    iii a. Who would like a drink?      b. Who would like tea or coffee?                         [variable]
               In [ib] or does not appear in the answers, which are simply “I would like tea” and “I
               would like coffee” – they are presented as alternative answers, such that one and only one
               of them is true. “Both” is not a possible answer in that it rejects this presupposition of
               mutual exclusiveness. In [iib] and [iiib], or is retained in the answers: e.g. “Yes, I would
               like tea or coffee” and “No, I would not like tea or coffee” for [iib].18       2.2.2 And and or in combination with negation
               When a subclausal or-coordination falls within the scope of a negative, it is equivalent
               to an and-coordination of negative clauses:
           [21] i I didn’t like his mother or his father.
                ii I didn’t like his mother and I didn’t                       [“not A-or-B” = “not-A and not-B”]
                   like his father.
               Similarly He can’t read or write means “He can’t read and he can’t write”, No one
               had seen Kim or Pat means “No one had seen Kim and no one had seen Pat”, and
               so on.
                   Conversely, when a subclausal and-coordination falls within the scope of a negative
               it is equivalent to an or-coordination of negative clauses:                                                                       
           [22] i He isn’t both treasurer and secretary.
                                                                               [“not A-and-B” = “not-A or not-B”]
               ii He isn’t treasurer or he isn’t secretary.
               Note that both of [22i–ii] implicate that he is either treasurer or secretary. In the case of [ii]
               or triggers the usual “not and” implicature – that “He isn’t treasurer” and “He isn’t secretary”
               are not both true. It then follows from this that “He is treasurer” and “He is secretary” are
               not both false, i.e. that he is either treasurer or secretary. In the case of [i] the implicature
               that he is either treasurer or secretary derives from the familiar type of scalar implicature:
               [i] is weaker than He isn’t either treasurer or secretary and hence implicates that the latter is
               not true.","[1317, 1318]"
"       Lexical reinforcement of bias
        The bias may be reinforced by lexical markers indicating confidence in the truth of the
        proposition expressed:
        [39] i They no doubt misunderstood her intentions?
             ii You’re surely not going to agree?
            iii And the manager has been informed, of course?
            iv There isn’t any chance of her changing her mind, I take it?
        These confidence markers are outside the propositional content of the question, outside
        the scope of the question. The positive answer to [39i], for example, is not They no
        doubt misunderstood her intentions, but simply They misunderstood her intentions. Such
        markers would not naturally occur in interrogative questions, where comparable items
        are epistemically much weaker:
        [40] i Did they perhaps misunderstand her intentions?
             ii Isn’t there any chance of her changing her mind, I wonder?
       Responses to declarative questions
        The bias of declarative questions is reflected in the fact that they can naturally receive
        confirmatory responses like That’s right, Exactly, Quite so, which would be out of place
        with a neutral question. Yes can even occur here with a following negative, which is not
        normally possible: Yes, there’s no chance at all is a plausible response to [39iv], but not to
        interrogative Is there any chance of her changing her mind? or even Isn’t there any chance
        of her changing her mind?",[902]
"       The distinction between answer and response
        Answer is to be distinguished from response, which is a purely pragmatic concept. If
        you ask question [1ia], Have you seen it?, I could give any of the following as response,
        or of course indefinitely many others:
       [2]     i No. I have.
              ii I’m not sure. I can’t remember. Possibly. Does it matter?
             iii I’ve already told you that I have. It’s on your desk. I saw it yesterday.
        The responses in [i] are answers, but the others are not. In [ii] I avoid giving an answer –
        whether on the grounds of insufficient knowledge or for some other reason. The re-
        sponses in [iii] implicate or entail the answer Yes, but they are not logically equivalent to
        Yes: they are not themselves answers. With It’s on your desk I interpret your question as
        indirectly asking “Where is it?”, and answer that – Have you seen my pen?, for example,
        is a conventional way of indirectly conveying “Where’s my pen?” The final response in
        [iii], I saw it yesterday, is not an answer because it contains extra information not called
        for in the question.
            It is clear, then, that for a wide range of reasons one very often responds to a question
        in some other way than by giving an answer. And such a response will sometimes contain
        less information than an answer would, and sometimes more.",[886]
"       7.8.3 Radical ellipsis in declarative responses
               Responses to questions are very often reduced to a single element of clause structure:
           [79] i a. A: When did she get home?                      B: Yesterday morning.
                   b. A: Why did they sack him?                     B: Because he’s incompetent.
                   c. A: What did she give you?                     B: A t-shirt.
                   d. A: What were they doing?                      B: Playing cards.
                ii a. A: Did you read them all?                     B: No, only the first three.
                   b. A: Were they fighting?                        B: No, just shouting at each other.
               In [i], B’s response gives an answer to A’s question. In [ia–c] it has the form of a phrase
               with the same function as the interrogative phrase in the question, so that [ia] is an
               elliptical version of She got home yesterday morning, and so on. The question in [id]
               concerns the complement of progressive be and the response serves as a replacement
               for do + what (cf. §7.6): They were playing cards. In [ii] B gives a negative answer to A’s
               polar question, and then asserts a contrasting positive proposition. B’s responses are thus
               equivalent to I didn’t read them all: I read only the first three and They weren’t fighting:
               they were just shouting at each other.
                   Radical reduction is also found with contrastive negation, as in:
           [80] i A: They’ve invited Jill.                                  B: Yes, but not her husband.
                ii A: They were shouting at each other.                     B: But not fighting.
               Her husband is contrasted with Jill, so that we understand “They have not invited her
               husband”. And similarly for [ii]: “They were not fighting”.",[1562]
"   Interrogatives
    The use of modal auxiliaries in interrogatives is in general predictable from their use
    in declaratives: only a few further points need be made, several of which relate to the
    common use of modalised questions as indirect speech acts (Ch. 10, §9.6.1). For shall,
    see §9.6.
    Must and need
    In declaratives these differ essentially as semantically positive (must) vs negative (needn’t),
    but in interrogatives both can appear in the positive: Must/Need we stay to the end? For
    either version the positive answer is Yes we must and the negative is No we needn’t.
    However, a lexical modal is more likely in such questions: Do we have to stay to the end?
    Must readily occurs in such indirect speech acts as MUST you interrupt when I’m speaking?
    This conveys that there is no necessity and that therefore you shouldn’t interrupt.
    Can, may, and will
    For epistemic possibility can is much preferred over may, and in either case the tentative
    preterite forms could and might are more likely: Could/Might it be a forgery? Ques-
    tions about deontic possibility are commonly used as indirect requests, for permission
    (May/Can I go with him?) or other things (May/Can I have some sugar?). Tentative could
    and might express diffidence, and would not appear in the answer (A: Could/Might
    I have a try? – B: Yes you can/may). Dynamic can (ability) and will (volition) simi-
    larly appear frequently in indirect requests, prototypically with a 2nd person subject:
    Can/Could/Will/Would you help me.
    Should
    This generally has a deontic interpretation in interrogatives: Should he go by bus? Be-
    cause should takes internal negation, the modality is effectively outside the scope of the
    question, which presupposes that he should do one of two things, go by bus or not go
    by bus. There is a special epistemic use in open interrogatives, normally with why, as in
    Why should he have resigned? This is ambiguous between a deontic reading “Why was
    the right thing for him to do to resign?” and an epistemic one not predictable from the
    use of should in declaratives, “Why do you assume/think he resigned?”",[225]
"        Modification of stimulus
         The stimulus is often modified by reduction – by omitting parts or replacing them by
         shorter expressions such as pro-forms. An echo response to Kim is going to try and
         persuade him to buy a microwave, for example, could take one of many forms, including:
         [52] i To try and persuade him to buy a microwave /one /a what?
              ii To buy a microwave /one /a what?
             iii Kim/Who is?
         And since the stimulus will normally be produced by a different speaker, there will be a
         change in deictic pronouns: I like it will be echoed as You like it?, and so on.
                                      § 4.8.1 The contrast between echo and ordinary questions         887
4.8.1 The contrast between echo and ordinary questions
   Echo questions as indirect speech acts
    The propositional content of echo questions is not the same as that which is actually
    expressed in the utterance, and such questions therefore belong to the class of indirect
    speech acts. The propositional content of the echo question in [51i] is not “She’s leaving
    on Saturday”, the content actually expressed, but something like “You said she’s leaving
    on Saturday”. (We say ‘something like’ for it could be “You’re telling me . . .”, “You’re
    suggesting . . .”, and so on: precisely because it is implicit rather than directly expressed
    there is some imprecision as to what it is.) And, correspondingly, the answer Yes is
    equivalent not to She’s leaving on Saturday, but to I said she’s leaving on Saturday. The
    difference between these two interpretations may not seem very important, but is of
    much greater significance in a case like:
    [53]      A: Is he going to resign?              B: Is he going to resign?
    The propositional content of B’s echo question is clearly not “He’s going to resign”, but
    “You said he’s going to resign”, and a Yes answer in this context is equivalent to I asked
    whether he is going to resign, not to He’s going to resign. The latter would be an answer to
    A’s question, not B’s – to an ordinary question, not an echo question. The same applies
    to the other kinds of question. For example, the propositional content of B’s variable
    question in [51iii] is approximately “You said that he’s going to x”.
    This indirectness is a crucial property distinguishing echo questions from ordinary questions.
    They are not distinguished simply by the fact that an echo question questions what has just
    been said, for it is perfectly possible to use an ordinary question to do that:
    [54]         previous utterance                     ordinary question
            i A: She’s leaving on Saturday.          B: Did you say she’s leaving on Saturday?
           ii A: He’s proposing to resign.           B: What did you say he’s proposing to do?
    Note that B’s utterances here may be said with the same prosodic signals of incredulity or
    the like that commonly accompany echo questions: these prosodic features are likewise not
    what is crucial for the echo question. There is nothing special about B’s questions in [54]:
    they are just ordinary questions whose subject matter happens to be the content of a previous
    utterance.
       The following also belong to the category of ordinary questions, not echoes:
    [55] i A: She’s leaving on Saturday.             B: Is she? [sc. leaving on Saturday]
         ii A: He’s proposing to resign.             B: What’s he proposing to do?
    B’s questions here are not echoes in the technical sense we are giving to that term in that they
    do have their face value. That is, they are genuinely questions as to whether she is leaving
    on Saturday and as to what he is proposing to do: assuming that what A said was true, the
    answers are She’s leaving on Saturday and He’s proposing to resign. Since A has already given
    the answers, B may be construed as challenging what A said or asking for repetition, but
    this is not a reason for identifying them with the echoes in [51]. (As we have seen, the polar
    question here could also be used simply to acknowledge, with surprise, what A has said.)
    The difference between these examples and the echoes is reflected in the difference in form:
    in [55] B’s questions have the characteristic grammatical form of ordinary questions, but in
    [51] they do not.
888         Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
      4.8.2 The grammatical form of variable echo questions
           We turn now to the form of echo questions, beginning with the variable kind. The
           variable echo question is grammatically marked by an echo-question word – what in
           the above examples. As there is here a fairly straightforward relation between grammar
           and meaning we can use the term ‘variable echo’ at both levels, speaking of a variable
           echo construction at the level of grammar and of a variable echo question at the level of
           meaning. And just as there is a difference in meaning between a variable echo question
           and a variable ordinary question, so there are differences in form.","[906, 907, 908]"
" Distinction between direction and information questions only
     weakly grammaticalised
     As far as unembedded questions are concerned, direction questions are not sharply
     distinguished in grammatical form from information questions. Matters are complicated
     by the fact that a response giving an answer to a question may, like utterances generally,
     have more than one illocutionary force. Consider, for example:
 [27] i a. Do you promise not to tell him?                   b. I promise not to tell him.
      ii a. Would you advise me to accept?                   b. I would advise you to accept.
     iii a. Have I got to eat it all?                        b. You have got to eat it all.
     iv a. %Shall I tell the police?                         b. You shall tell the police.
     For convenience, we give the answers in unreduced form, rather than as Yes, I do, etc.
     Answer [ib] has the illocutionary verb promise used performatively, so that it is a promise
     as well as a statement. Similarly [iib] both makes a statement and gives advice: it differs
     from [ib] in that the advice force is indirect rather than direct, because we have I would
     advise, not I advise. Answer [iiib] is literally a statement but, in the context of answering
     question [iiia], stating that you have to eat it all amounts to telling you to do so. Here
     then we have an answer which is both statement and directive. However, from the point
     of view of its form, and more specifically of the relation between its form and that of its
     answer, there is nothing special about [iiia]. What makes [iva] different from the other
     questions is that shall here has a sense that is specialised to direction questions: [ivb] is
     not a possible answer precisely because the meaning of shall is not the same.
        The semantic development of shall has led to a situation where it has a use in 1st
     person interrogatives that specifically marks direction questions. It can also be used with
     a futurity sense, as in the information question Shall I ever need it again? As a result,
     there is potential for ambiguity:
 [28]         Shall I get my money back?                               [direction or information question] 9
     Direction questions are also known as ‘deliberative questions’.
878         Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
           As a direction question, this is concerned with the choice between future actions by
           the speaker: I’m asking you to tell me to retrieve it or not to do so. As an information
           question, it is concerned with predictions as to what will happen: will the money be
           returned or not?10
           The case with should is less clear-cut. Should I get my money back? is ambiguous between a
           deontic reading (“Is getting my money back the right thing for me to do?”) and an epistemic
           one (“Is it probable that I’ll get it back?”). But the ambiguity is also found in You should get
           your money back. So the development of should has certainly not been entirely parallel to
           that of shall. Nevertheless, we do see something partly analogous. While Yes, you should is a
           perfectly natural (deontic) response to Should I tell the police?, it would be odd to respond in
           this way to Should I open the window?, said in a context where it is a matter of my possibly
           opening the window there and then. In this use should behaves like shall – and could not be
           replaced by ought . . .to, as it could in Should I tell the police?","[897, 898]"
"
3.2 Indirect speech acts
   Illocutionary force is very often conveyed indirectly rather than directly. Consider:
   [7]      Do you know what time it is?
   A likely context for this (not the only possible one of course) is where I don’t know
   the time, want to know the time, and believe you may well be able to tell me. In this
862         Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
           context it would indirectly convey “What time is it?” This is why it would be thoroughly
           unco-operative in such a context for you to respond merely with Yes. Yes would answer
           the question that is actually asked, but not the one that I in fact want to have answered.
           Another plausible context for [7] is where it is addressed to a child (by a parent, say)
           when it is known to be past the child’s bedtime: here my intention may well be to convey
           a directive to go to bed.
               In either contextualisation, I perform two illocutionary acts simultaneously, one
           directly (a question as to whether you know what time it is), and one indirectly (a
           question as to what time it is, or a directive to go to bed). We will follow the established
           practice of referring to indirect illocutionary acts as indirect speech acts (with the
           understanding that the term covers writing as well as speech). Commonly, the direct act
           is obviously less important than the indirect one – as when the interest of the question
           whether you know the time is simply that if you do you will be able to answer the question
           that I really do want an answer to. There is an analogy here with performatives, and we
           will again, where appropriate, apply the terms ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ to the different
           acts or forces. Thus just as in the performative I promise to return the key tomorrow the
           promise is primary and the statement secondary, so in the first contextualisation of [7]
           the question about the time is primary and that about your knowledge secondary. The
           difference is that in the performative case the primary act is direct, whereas in such cases
           as [7] it is not.","[881, 882]"
"       13
            Whereabouts can be used instead of where to indicate that only an approximate answer is envisaged. However,
            the noun whereabouts (derived from the preposition by shift of stress from the last syllable to the first) is not
            an interrogative word: His whereabouts aren’t known is declarative and has no embedded interrogative clause
            within it. Interrogative whence (“from where”) and whither (“to where”) are archaic. So too is wherein, which
            is the only one of the compounds of interrogative where + preposition that one is likely to encounter; its
            archaic status is seen in the fact that it does not require do-support but allows inversion of subject + lexical
            verb, as in Wherein lies its appeal?

  Why in response to directives and questions
   Why also differs from the other interrogative words in examples like:
   [14] i A: Get your money back.                  B: When?/Why?
        ii A: Did you see her?                     B: When?/Why?
   B’s When? in [i] asks for a more specific directive, whereas Why? asks for a reason for
   complying with the directive. Features such as time and place count as features of the
   action itself (getting your money back tomorrow is a different action from getting it
   back next week), but reason does not (getting your money back counts as the same
   action, whether you do it for this reason or for that). Similarly in [ii] When? asks for
   further specification of the propositional content of A’s question: it is a clarificatory echo
   question, elliptical for Did I see her when? (cf. §4.8.4). Why?, by contrast, asks for A’s
   reason for asking the question – and could accompany an answer to the question, as in
   Yes, why?","[926, 927]"

4.2 Summary classification of questions
   Questions can be classified in numerous different ways. In the following sections we will
   examine distinctions on the four dimensions shown in [4] where the first distinguishes
   three kinds of question, the others two each:
   [4]     i polar                      alternative               variable
             Is it breathing?           Is it alive or dead?      Why isn’t it moving?
          ii information                           direction
             What time is it?                      Shall I put some music on?
         iii neutral                               biased
             Have you read it?                     Haven’t you read it yet?
         iv ordinary (non-echo)                    echo
             What’s he going to do?                He’s going to what?
   Dimension [i] is based on the way the question defines the set of answers. Polar and
   alternative make up the class we have called closed question, and both are characteristi-
   cally expressed by closed interrogatives. Variable questions are open questions, and are
   expressed by open interrogatives. We examine polar, alternative, and variable questions
   in turn in the next three sections.
       For the other three dimensions the category in the left column of [4] can be regarded
   as the default, and §§4.6–8 will therefore focus respectively on direction questions (where
   the answers have the force of directives, not statements), biased questions (where the
   speaker is biased in favour of one answer over another) and echo questions (which seek
   repetition or clarification of what has just been said).
868          Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
               In addition, we take the view that while intonation may mark a question it does
            not mark interrogative clause type, and hence with respect to the syntactic form of
            (non-echo) polar questions we distinguish:
            [5]      interrogative question                            declarative question
                     Are you ready?                                    You’re ready?","[887, 888]"
"4.8.3 The form of polar echo questions
     Unlike the variable echo question, the polar echo is not, for the most part, expressed by
     any special grammatical construction: rather, the echo is signalled prosodically, by the
890         Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
           rising intonation. A polar echo question can have the syntactic form belonging to any
           of the clause types. Polar counterparts of the variable echoes given in [58], for example,
           are as follows:
           [60]        stimulus                        polar echo question
                  i A: She’s a genius.              B: She’s a genius?                   [declarative]
                 ii A: Did Kim complain?            B: Did Kim complain?       [closed interrogative]
                iii A: What did he tell her?        B: What did he tell her?     [open interrogative]
                iv A: What a fuss Ed made!          B: What a fuss Ed made?             [exclamative]
                 v A: Give the key to Angela.       B: Give the key to Angela?           [imperative]
           The echo repeats the stimulus, with rising intonation signalling a request for repetition,
           or justification.
           We have seen that rising intonation can also combine with declarative clause type to yield an
           ordinary polar (or alternative) question, and there is accordingly again potential ambiguity
           in examples like She’s a genius? It can be an ordinary (direct) question whose answers are
           She’s a genius and She’s not a genius; or it can be, as in [60i], a polar echo (indirect) question
           whose answers are I said she’s a genius and I didn’t say she’s a genius. In both cases the question
           is biased – towards an answer which expresses the same propositional content as is expressed
           in the direct question or implied in the indirect one. For example, in:
           [61]     a. She gave it to him?              b. She didn’t give it to him?
           the expected answers for the ordinary question interpretations are, for [a], She gave it to him
           and, for [b], She didn’t give it to him, whereas those for the echo question interpretations are
           respectively I said, ‘She gave it to him’ and I said, ‘She didn’t give it to him’.","[909, 910]"
" The closed interrogative construction
     There are also differences between closed interrogatives in the ungoverned conditional
     construction and those which occur elsewhere, though this time it is a matter of an
     important restriction that applies. Closed interrogatives in general express either polar
     questions (Is he the best candidate?) or alternative questions (Is the meeting in Paris or
     in Bonn? or Is he the best candidate or not?) – see Ch. 10, §§4.3–4. Those expressing
     alternative questions contain an or-coordination, with each coordinate corresponding
     to one of the answers (“The meeting is in Paris” and “The meeting is in Bonn” or “He
     is the best candidate” and “He is not the best candidate”). In the ungoverned exhaustive
17
     A further point concerns the idiomatic interrogative construction with what + be doing : What were they doing
     reading her mail?, “Why were they reading her mail?” This is admissible in the exhaustive conditional (I’m
     still going to complain about invasion of privacy, whatever they were doing reading my mail), but is completely
     excluded from the fused relative (∗She didn’t complain about whatever they were doing reading her mail).
990      Chapter 11 Content clauses and reported speech
        conditional only the alternative kind of question is permitted, i.e. an or-coordination is
        obligatory:                                                                                      
       [63] i They will attend the meeting [whether it is in Paris or in Bonn.)
                                                                                           [alternative]
            ii They will appoint Jones [whether he is the best candidate or not.)
           iii ∗They will appoint Jones [whether he is the best candidate].                      [polar]
        The interrogative clause in [iii] is perfectly admissible in the governed construction:
        They will appoint Jones regardless of whether he is the best candidate.
           As with the case of the ·ever forms in the open construction, this special property of
        closed interrogatives in adjunct function can be related to the fact that there is nothing
        outside the clause itself to indicate that the choice between the various cases defined
        by answers to the question doesn’t matter. In polar questions, one of the answers is left
        implicit: the obligatory presence of or not in [63ii] ensures that both answers are explicitly
        represented.
       The status of whether
       In traditional grammar the subordinate clauses in [63] are analysed as adverbial clauses, not
       subordinate interrogatives (‘indirect questions’). Adapting to our descriptive framework, this
       would be to say that whether here is a preposition, not an interrogative subordinator. Whether
       would then be like if, belonging to both preposition and subordinator categories. While this
       distinction is certainly necessary in the case of if, however, we do not believe that it is in the
       case of whether. There is a clear semantic difference between the if of I’ll do it if I’ve time
       and that of I don’t know if I’ve time, but there is no such difference in the case of whether
       between, say, [60b] and [60a]: as we have said, the systematic relations between the four
       constructions in [60] are most simply described if all the subordinate clauses are analysed
       as interrogative. Note, moreover, that the two constructions are syntactically alike in that
       the ungoverned conditional, like all subordinate closed interrogatives, allows or not to follow
       whether :
       [64] i You’ll have to stop now (regardless of ) whether you have finished or not.
            ii You’ll have to stop now (regardless of ) whether or not you have finished.
        On both semantic and syntactic grounds, therefore, we recognise just one item whether, an
        interrogative subordinator.","[1009, 1010]"
"
      5.2 The use and interpretation of tags
        Reversed polarity tags
         The illocutionary force of an utterance with the form anchor + tag depends on the
         prosody. The two principal patterns both have falling tone on the anchor; the tag itself
         is either rising or, more frequently, falling:
         [10]         positive anchor                          negative anchor
                 i a. He was here, wasn’t he?              b. He wasn’t here, was he?            [rising tag]
                ii a. He was here, wasn’t he?              b. He wasn’t here, was he?           [falling tag]
         (a) The rising tag
         This expresses doubt or asks for verification: the question is biased towards an answer
         that confirms the anchor. A special case, involving a negative anchor, is prosodically
         distinguished by a somewhat wider pitch movement and the lack of any rhythmic break
         between anchor and tag. Here there is no such bias towards an answer with the same
         polarity as the anchor:
         [11]      It isn’t raining again, is it?   It isn’t my turn already, is it?
         If anything, there is a bias towards a positive answer, but in addition the construction
         has an emotive component of meaning – a suggestion of being afraid that the positive
         answer is the true one.
         (b) The falling tag
         The version with falling intonation on the tag does not express doubt: the question merely
         seeks acknowledgement that the anchor is true. Thus it can be used in a context where
         the anchor is obviously true: Good gracious, you’re up early this morning, aren’t you?,
                                                                           § 5.3 Parentheticals   895
   uttered at 4 a.m., say. There may be, as perhaps in this example, an implicit invitation
   to provide an explanation (Yes, I’ve got a train to catch). Or I may want you to admit
   something you didn’t previously accept (I was right all along, wasn’t I?). Or again I
   might be asking for your agreement to some minor uncontroversial proposition (It’s
   a lovely day again, isn’t it?). Thus an exclamative anchor will normally take a falling
   tag because I can hardly ask you to confirm my exclamation: What a mess I’ve made of
   things, haven’t I? With an exclamative the truth of the proposition is not at issue (see
   §8.2), so that such an anchor is inconsistent with the expression of doubt. The falling
   tag may therefore have the character of a rhetorical question, where an answer-response
   is unnecessary.","[914, 915]"
"  47
       The idiom so far can be used either deictically or anaphorically. The deictic use is seen in I have so far
       marked about half of them (“up to now”); the anaphoric use in I had so far marked about half of them (“up to
       then”).
1536          Chapter 17 Deixis and anaphora
       (a) Pro-clause complement with finite antecedent: I think so
           [58] i A: Are they putting the price up? B: I think so. / I’m afraid so. / It seems so.
                ii She thought he was wrong but was too polite to say so.
               iii She was totally opposed to the idea and told the premier so.
               iv Will she accept the recommendations, and if so how will they affect us?
             So here stands for a clause in complement function: we understand “I think they are putt-
             ing the price up”, and so on. The understood clause is always declarative, though the an-
             tecedent can be interrogative, as in [i/iv]. This construction is found with the conditional
             preposition if, the adjective afraid, and a fair number of verbs, a sample of which are
             given in:
          [59]       appear            assume               believe              fear               gather            guess
                     hope              imagine              presume              reckon             regret            say
                     seem              suppose              suspect              tell               think             trust
             Appear and seem take impersonal it as subject: it seems so. Many of the others allow
             passivisation, with so then in extraposed subject position: It is believed so, etc. Verbs
             which, by contrast, do not allow so to substitute for a clausal complement include confirm,
             doubt, realise, resent.48
                 A number of the verbs in [59] also allow it or that as a pro-clause anaphor. In most
             cases there is a fairly clear difference in meaning between so and these NPs. It is particu-
             larly clear in 1st person singular present tense examples like I believe so vs I believe it/that.
             With I believe so the main issue is the truth of the antecedent proposition: I might well
             use this in response to a polar question to give a modally qualified positive answer. With
             I believe it/that the main issue is whether I believe the proposition concerned (and this
             time the antecedent could hardly be interrogative). The difference emerges very sharply
             if we add yes. In Yes, I believe so, the yes relates to the proposition expressed by so; in
             Yes, I believe it/that the yes relates to the matrix proposition: “Yes I do believe”. Or take
             the verb regret. I regret so is understood as “Yes, regrettably”, while in I regret it/that the
             truth of the proposition expressed by the complement is taken for granted, and what is
             asserted is that my attitude to it is one of regret.
             Polarity: so and not
             So normally expresses a positive proposition, with not being used as the corresponding
             negative pro-form. In response to Will Kim be there?, for example, I hope so is understood
             as “I hope Kim will be there” and I hope not as “I hope Kim will not be there”.49 There
             is likewise a straightforward contrast with if between positive so and negative not. With
             say and tell, however, so readily substitutes for a negative clause and not is quite rare and
             often inadmissible outside responses to questions:
          [60] i She didn’t approve of the idea and told them so/∗not.
               ii A: Will they be accepting the proposal? B: She says not.","[1555, 1556]"
"
6.1 Q–A presuppositions of alternative questions
   The possible answers to [1i] are given in [ii], and its Q–A presupposition in [iii]:
  [1]     i Is he leaving on Monday or Tuesday?                                      [alternative Q]
         ii “He is leaving on Monday”; “He is leaving on Tuesday”                          [answers]
        iii “He is leaving on Monday or Tuesday”                                   [presupposition]
   To presuppose that [i] has a right answer is to presuppose the disjunction (or-coordi-
   nation) of the possible answers, i.e. “Either he is leaving on Monday or he is leaving
   on Tuesday”, which is logically equivalent to [iii]. The presupposition of an alternative
   question can thus be derived simply by taking the corresponding statement.
898       Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
         The or in alternative questions and their presuppositions is interpreted exclusively – i.e. the
         question presents a set of alternatives with the presupposition that one, but only one, is true.
         Just as [1i] does not countenance the possibility that he will not leave on Monday or Tuesday,
         so it does not countenance the possibility that he will leave on both days. This relation of
         mutual exclusiveness between the alternatives is perfectly consistent with the use of such
         expressions as or both:
         [2]     i Would you like cheese, fruit, or both?                         [alternative question]
                ii “You would like cheese”; “You would like fruit”;
                   “You would like both fruit and cheese”                                    [answers]
               iii “You would like cheese or fruit or both”                            [presupposition]
         The or both simply adds a third alternative, mutually exclusive with the first two, for “cheese”
         and “fruit” in the first two answers are interpreted as “just cheese” and “just fruit”.","[917, 918]"
"        Direction questions and to-infinitivals
            Unlike the other interrogative words, why is not normally possible in direction questions.
            Thus %Why shall I get my money back? can only be an information question, with answers
            like You will get your money back because the manufacturer has accepted responsibility for
            the defect. In to-infinitivals, why is just possible in the titular use: Why to vote yes in the
            referendum.",[926]
"       Duality
        The examples in [7] convey that there were at least three pies. Suppose we take a scenario
        in which I know that there are just two. I would then use both rather than all: He had
        eaten both of the pies. There is no distinct simple determinative that would replace some
        in this scenario: we would have to say He had eaten one or other of the pies or He had
        eaten one of the two pies. We do, however, have either and neither as replacements for any
        and none respectively. This gives the following pattern corresponding to [7]:
       [8]    i a. He hadn’t eaten [both of the pies].
             ii a. He hadn’t eaten [both of the pies].       b. He had eaten [neither of the pies].
                                                             b . He hadn’t eaten [either of the pies].
        As before, [iib/b ] are strongly preferred over [iia].
                                § 5.1 Existential and universal quantification, and negation       361
     The following table shows the classification of the simple quantifiers introduced so
 far:
 [9]                      universal                         existential
                                            basic        non-affirmative         negative
         neutral             all            some              any                 no
         dual                both                             either              neither
  All, we have noted, is not normally used in a context where it is known that the set has just
  two members: compare Cars were parked on both/#all sides of the road. However, the “more
  than two” component in examples like He had eaten all of the pies is an implicature not
  an entailment. The right answer to the question Have all (the) mistakes been corrected? in
  a situation where there were exactly two mistakes and both have been corrected is “Yes”,
  not “No”. And of course no such “more than two” implicature can arise in non-count
  cases like all of the meat. It is for these reasons that we have labelled all ‘neutral’: there
  is no explicit indication of the size of the set or quantity.
      In the dual series the “two” meaning is more prominent in universal both than in
  existential either and neither. Compare, for example, the interrogatives:
 [10]    a. Did he eat both of the pies?               b. Did he eat either of the pies?
  A “yes” answer to [a] entails that he ate two pies, while a “yes” answer to [b] does not: it
  is merely that there are two pies under consideration. The greater prominence of “two”
  in both is reflected in the syntax of coordination. Both, either, and neither are the three
  words that can function to mark the first member of a coordination construction, and
  while both is limited to binary coordinations, either and neither are not. Thus we have
  both Kim and Pat but not ∗both Kim, Pat, and Alex, whereas either Kim, Pat, or Alex and
  neither Kim, Pat, nor Alex are admissible.","[380, 381]"
"       No alternative interrogative clause type corresponding to alternative question
        Although [8i] and [ii] are, semantically, different kinds of question, they do not belong,
        grammatically, to different clause types. This is one reason why we have adopted different
        terminologies for subclassification at the two levels. Semantically we distinguish three
        kinds of question on the basis of the way they define the set of answers: polar, alternative,
        and variable. But grammatically there are just two subtypes of interrogative: closed and
        open.
        The reason we do not treat the or of alternative questions as a clause type marker is that
        the coordination in which it figures may be between clauses, as in [7ii]. This is a clause-
        coordination, not a clause, so the issue of what clause type it belongs to doesn’t arise. And as
        for the component clauses, is it genuine and is it a hoax, they have the same syntactic form as
        clauses expressing polar questions. Note that with embedded questions the clause subordi-
        nator whether can appear in both coordinates: I don’t know whether it’s genuine or whether it’s
        a hoax. From a grammatical point of view, therefore, alternative questions are distinguished
        from polar questions not by the system of clause type but by a special use of coordination.",[890]

 6 The presuppositions of information questions  Pragmatic Q–A presuppositions
   In general, when I ask a question I presuppose that it has a right answer. We are concerned
   here with pragmatic presupposition: to presuppose something in this sense is to take
   it for granted, as not at issue, to present it as uncontroversial background. In the case of
   information questions, to presuppose that a question has a right answer is to presuppose
   that one of the possible answers is true.
       There are several different kinds of pragmatic presupposition, and we will accordingly
   refer more specifically to the kind we are concerned with here as a question–answer
   presupposition (‘Q–A presupposition’). The most straightforward case is perhaps that
   of the alternative question: we will look at this first, and then examine how the concept
   of Q–A presupposition applies to polar and variable questions.",[917]
" Coordinations of like type
     An unmixed coordination of main declaratives (Kim is in Bonn and Pat is too) can
     generally be taken as a single statement of a composite proposition, though (at least
     with and ) it would make no effective difference if we regarded it as a combination of
     statements, each of a simple proposition. Analogously for imperatives.
        The situation with interrogatives is more complex. And, as in Who is it and what
     do they want?, can be taken to join questions, though again this hardly differs from
     an interpretation as a single composite question (with answers like “It’s Jill and she
     wants to borrow the saw”). But does not normally coordinate main interrogatives (we
     would not say Who is it but what do they want?).54 With or we have several distinct
     possibilities:
     [27] i Is it genuine or is it a hoax?                                                     [alternative Q]
          ii Have you moved or are you about to move?                                 [alternative or polar Q]
         iii Either can you eat it or have I got one?                                   [two polar questions]
     Example [i] is a single question, with or marking it as of the alternative kind: the answers
     are “It is genuine” and “It is a hoax”. Example [ii], discussed in Ch. 10, §4.4, could
     also be an alternative question, asking whether your move has already taken place or is
     imminent. But it can also be a single polar question, asked for example in order to find
     out whether the writer’s record of your address needs changing: here the answers are
     “Yes, I have moved or am about to move” and “No, I have not moved nor am I about
     to move”. This is comparable to [26ic], for in both of them the whole coordination
     expresses a single polar question, but whereas with and the second clause is declarative,
     with or it has to be interrogative. Example [27iii] is a coordination of questions: much
     less usual, but possible in a context where, for example, I am trying to solve a puzzle and
     say, Give me a clue by answering one of the following questions: Either can . . . The either
     in [iii] makes explicit that the coordination has wide scope, i.e that it is a coordination
     of questions. It could not appear at the beginning of [i–ii], where the coordination
     has narrow scope (coordination within a question). This scope factor accounts for the53
   The same applies in informal speech in examples like Did he come in and I was still asleep? (=[30ii] of §2),
   or How could you have been so spiteful, and her your best friend? (where the second clause is verbless, and is
   interpreted as “given that she was your best friend”). A further case where an element in the first coordinate
   may have scope over the second is seen in It might be up there and I can’t see it : here might has wide scope, the
   meaning being “it might be that it is up there and I can’t see it”.
54
   Exceptions arise when one of the interrogatives is used as an indirect statement: Isn’t it a bargain, but where
   could we put it?
1334          Chapter 15 Coordination and supplementation
             fact noted earlier (§2.3) that either can never correlate with the or of an alternative
             question.55
       3.6 Level of coordination
         Equivalence at different levels
             It is an important property of coordination, we have noted, that it can occur at al-
             most any place in constituent structure. As a result, we have equivalences such as those
             shown in:
             [28] i They shot her father and they shot her mother.                          [clauses]
                   ii They shot her father and shot her mother.                                 [VPs]
                  iii They shot her father and her mother.                                     [NPs]
                  iv They shot her father and mother.                                        [nouns]
             (Coordinations at different levels may differ in meaning in ways described in §1.3: we will
             not be concerned with those differences in the present section.) The lower the level, the
             less repetition there is; but the most economical version, the one with the coordination
             at the lowest level, is not always the preferred one.
                 In general, lower-level coordination tends to suggest a closer association between the
             coordinates than higher-level coordination. Given that there is a very close association
             between one’s father and one’s mother, the word-level coordination in They shot her father
             and mother is perfectly natural; in the absence of special contextual factors, however,
             there is no similarly close association between one’s father and one’s solicitor, and hence
             one would be more likely to say She was accompanied by her father and her solicitor, with
             the coordination at phrase level, than · · · by her father and solicitor. Compare, similarly,
             I need a shirt and tie (strong association: coordination of nouns) and I need a diary
             and a calculator (weaker association: coordination of phrases). Or again: my friend and
             colleague (a single person) and my boss and my secretary (different people).
                 We have also noted that determinatives tend not to coordinate readily, with a higher-
             level coordination preferred in cases like this copy and those. Similarly, while be allows
             mixed coordinations as complement, a version where be is repeated will often be preferred
             or required when non-finites are involved, as in He was insolent and was dismissed.
             Number constraints on coordination of nouns
             In NP structure certain determiners are sensitive to the number of the head, as described
             in Ch. 5, §3.4. The demonstratives this and that agree with the head, and determiners
             such as a, one, each select singular heads, while many, several, two, etc., select plurals.
             Coordinations of nouns (or nominals) in head function are subject to various constraints
             illustrated in:
             [29] i a. ∗these elephant and giraffe            b. ∗two elephant and giraffe
                   ii a. this cup and saucer                  b. a/one cup and saucer
                  iii a. #this elephant and giraffe           b. #an/one elephant and giraffe
             The examples in [i] demonstrate that a coordination of singulars does not count syntac-
             tically as plural, and hence cannot combine with a plural demonstrative or a determiner        55
             In the case of [27ii] it is marginally possible to have either to the right of its basic position before the first
             coordinate, as in Have you either moved or are you about to move?
                                                                                     § 3.6 Level of coordination             1335
     that selects a plural head. Such a coordination can combine with a singular demonstra-
     tive or a determiner selecting a singular head if there is a close association between the
     coordinates, as in [ii]. Thus a cup and a saucer can be conceptualised as a unit, but this
     would not normally be possible with an elephant and a giraffe. Instead of [iii], therefore,
     we would normally have coordination at the NP level, with separate determiners: this
     elephant and this giraffe, and so on. Note, moreover, that whatever the determiner, a
     singular cannot coordinate with a plural at the word level: the women and the man, not
     ∗
      the women and man.56
     The dissociating effect of higher-level coordination
     When the close association factor could be expected to sanction a lower-level coor-
     dination, use of a higher-level one may serve to separate, to partially dissociate the
     coordinates. Compare:
 [30] i He had dinner and watched TV.                                                          [VP-coordination]
      ii He had dinner and he watched TV.                                                   [clause-coordination]
     In [i] we have a common sequence of events, whereas in [ii] we might be listing more
     sharply distinguished events, and it does not convey as strongly as [i] that the events
     took place in the order in which they are expressed.","[1353, 1354, 1355]"
"  Q–A presuppositions in relation to the set consisting of all the answers
   Another, but equivalent, approach to an explanation of the Q–A presupposition of a
   variable question is to see it as following from every one of the answers. Thus instead of
   [6], for example, we might have:
   [8]     i Who wrote the editorial?                                      [variable question]
          ii “Ian wrote the editorial”; “I wrote the editorial”;
             “One of the directors wrote the editorial”; . . .                      [answers]
         iii “Someone wrote the editorial”                                   [presupposition]
   If Ian wrote the editorial, it follows that someone wrote it, and similarly for all other
   answers.
900       Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
         It is important to note, however, that the presupposition may follow not from the answer
         alone, but from the answer together with the premise that it is an answer. Consider [9i] and
         the sample of responses given in [ii]:
         [9]    i a. What Soviet president won the Nobel Peace Prize?                           [question]
                  b. “Some Soviet president won the Nobel Peace Prize”                    [presupposition]
               ii a. Mikhail Gorbachov won the Nobel Peace Prize.
                  b. Leonid Brezhnev won the Nobel Peace Prize.
                  c. Willy Brandt won the Nobel Peace Prize.
         The right answer is [iia], but this does not by itself entail [ib]: we need the additional
         premise “Mikhail Gorbachov is/was a Soviet president”. Though false, [iib] is still an answer.
         By contrast, [iic] is true, but not a true answer, because the additional premise – “Willy
         Brandt is/was a Soviet president” – is false. Presuppositions thus play a significant role in the
         interpretation of responses to variable questions. If you interpret a response as an answer you
         add to its content whatever additional premise is needed for the presupposition to be entailed.
            No such additional premises are needed with alternative and polar questions. Here the pre-
         supposition is a disjunction of the answers, and since any proposition “p” entails “p or q”, any
         one answer will always entail the disjunction of the set of answers. In [1], for example, if “He is
         leaving on Monday” is true, then obviously “He is leaving on Monday or Tuesday” is also true.","[919, 920]"
"
 9.6 Non-imperative directives
9.6.1 Interrogatives as directives
     Directives are very often conveyed indirectly by means of interrogatives. This is espe-
     cially so with requests – particularly when speaker and addressee are not intimates. The
     imperative structure, we have noted, can be used for a wide range of directives, including
     orders: to make a request by means of an imperative may therefore run the risk of ap-
     pearing too brusque or peremptory, even if illocutionary modifiers like please and kindly
     are added. In many circumstances indirect directives with interrogative form are con-
     sidered more polite. This is not to suggest that there is any simple correlation between
     interrogative form and politeness with directives. In the first place, prosody plays an
     important and in part independent role: Can you move your car? will typically be more
     polite than Move your car, but this can be overridden by an impatient, emphatic tone of
     voice. Secondly it depends on the content of the interrogative: Can you move your car
     lends itself much more readily to use as a polite request than, say, Must you park your car
     across my driveway?
        We find a great variety of interrogative directives, but four of the most important
     semantic categories concern: (a) your ability to do something; (b) your desire or willing-
     ness to do something; (c) the deontic necessity for you to do something; (d) the reason
     for you to do something:
     [42] i Can you open the door. (“Open the door”)                                          [ability]
          ii Would you like to / Will you sign here? (“Sign here”)                [desire/willingness]
         iii Must you talk so loud? (“Don’t talk so loud”)                         [deontic necessity]
         iv Why don’t you bring your radio? (“Bring your radio”)                              [reason]
940       Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
         (As noted in §3.2, there is some variation with respect to punctuation, with a full stop
         often preferred to a question mark in the ability or desire/willingness cases.)      (a) Ability questions
          These lend themselves to indirect directive use since a likely reason for me to be interested
          in your ability to do something is that I want you to do it. Typical openers are:
         [43]     can you, could you, is it possible ( for you), will/would it be possible (for you), are
                  you able, will/would you be able
         The versions with can are most frequent, and are especially likely in contexts where the
         answer is obviously “yes”, so that the direct inquiry force is effectively lost; this will usually
         apply with such everyday examples as Can you pass the salt, etc. The forms with preterites
         (could/would, with the preterite indicating tentativeness) are regarded as more polite.
            All the above could be negated: can’t you, couldn’t you, etc. Negative questions are
         always biased, and in the present case the negation adds some emotive component of
         meaning, perhaps impatience (Can’t you talk a little louder?, suggesting you ought to be
         able to) or persuasiveness (Couldn’t you stay a little bit longer?). Inflectional negatives
         always have the ability predicate within their scope; analytic ones with can are potentially
         ambiguous as to scope. Can you not stand by the door, for example, can have the not in
         the can clause or in the stand clause. In the first case it is a negative question conveying
         the positive directive “Stand by the door”, and in the second it is a positive question
         conveying the negative directive “Don’t stand by the door”.      (b) Desire/willingness questions
          These likewise have a natural connection with directives: if you want or are willing to do
          something you are likely to comply with a request to do it. Typical formulae are:
         [44] i will/would you, would you like to / care to / be so kind as to       [+ infinitival]
              ii do/would you mind                                            [+ gerund-participial]
         Again the tentative preterite would adds to the effect of politeness. (Note that want occurs
         in this use with do but not would, and is appreciably less polite: Do you want to clear
         the table so that we can have lunch?) Inflectional negatives are possible for those taking
         infinitival complements, especially the first three (won’t/wouldn’t you, wouldn’t you like
         to); they do not occur with mind, for the salient bias of the question would be positive,
         suggesting that you do/would mind. The analytic negatives will/would you not have the
         scope ambiguity illustrated above for can. Compare:
         [45] i Will you not [take a seat]?                                            [not in will clause]
              ii Will you [not put your feet on the sofa].                             [not in put clause]
         The pragmatically salient interpretations have primary verb negation in [i], “Take a seat”,
         and secondary negation in [ii], “Don’t put your feet on the sofa”.
            Closely related to desire/willingness is prospective intentional future, as in Are/Aren’t
         you going to tidy your room? These express doubt as to whether you intend to do what
         you should do, and for this reason are quite well down the politeness scale.      (c) Deontic necessity questions
          Deontic necessity is usually questioned by must, as in [42iii] or have (Do you have to talk
          so loud?), though need, necessary, etc., are also possible (cf. Need you / Is it necessary to talk
          so loud?). The situation denoted in the complement clause (your talking so loud) is one
                                                                § 9.6.2 Declaratives as directives     941
     that I regard as undesirable, and the question has, in context, a clear negative bias: I don’t
     think there is any necessity for you to talk so loud. Hence the implied directive – whose
     content is this time the opposite of that expressed in the complement clause. Suggesting
     that you are unnecessarily doing what I don’t want does not of course make for a polite
     directive.  (d) Reason questions
      These are usually expressed by means of why and have been discussed in §4.5. Here again
      the content of the implicit directive is the opposite of that expressed in the question,
      whether the latter is negative, as in [42iv], or positive, as in Why accept less? (“Don’t
      accept less”).    3rd person
     The above examples all have you as subject, but just as imperatives can have 3rd person
     subjects, so can interrogatives with directive force: Will everyone remember to sign the
     register. It is also possible to have 3rd person subjects in examples like those given in [42]:
     Can he come a little earlier tonight?; Would he like to return my wrench?; Must they talk
     so loud?; Why doesn’t she bring her radio? These aren’t equivalent to imperatives because
     they are not addressed to the person(s) concerned, but can still have indirect directive
     force, suggesting that you should convey the directive to whoever is to comply.    1st person inclusive
     Interrogatives used with essentially the same force as 1st person inclusive imperatives
     generally begin with shall we or why :
     [46] i Shall we go for a swim?
          ii Why don’t we eat out tonight? Why waste our time on it?
     At the direct level, [i] is a direction question whose answers are expressed by 1st person
     inclusive imperatives: in context the question is biased towards the positive answer, “Let’s
     go for a swim”, which it therefore indirectly conveys.","[959, 960, 961]"
"      4.4 Alternative questions
        Answers to alternative questions
            Alternative questions have as answers a set of alternatives given in the question itself.
            For example, the answers to Is it right or wrong? are It’s right and It’s wrong, which are
            derivable directly from the question. This example contains two alternatives, but there
            may be more: e.g. three in Would you like to meet in the morning, the afternoon, or the
            evening?",[888]
"4.7.2 Declarative questions
    Positive declarative questions have an epistemic bias towards a positive answer, negative
    ones towards a negative answer:
    [38]      a. They’ve finished?                b. They haven’t finished?
    The expected answer is here the statement with the same propositional content as
    the question – i.e. They’ve finished and They haven’t finished respectively. In asking a
882      Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
        declarative question I am typically seeking confirmation of a proposition that I am in-
        clined, with varying degrees of strength, to believe. There may be deontic or desiderative
        bias as well as epistemic, but this is not inherent to the construction as such.","[901, 902]"
"
5.3 Survey of constructions containing subordinate interrogatives
  Classification of embedded questions
   In Ch. 10 we distinguished numerous different kinds of question, but for present purposes
   it is sufficient to consider two dimensions of contrast. One is that between information
   questions and direction questions mentioned above, and the other is between polar,
   alternative, and variable questions. These dimensions cut across each other, yielding the
   following six categories:
  [16]                information                       direction
          polar       I don’t know if it is possible.   I don’t know whether to tell them.
          alternative I don’t know if it’s true or not. I don’t know whether to go or not.
          variable    I don’t know what he wants.       I don’t know what to do.
   Variable questions are expressed by open interrogatives, polar and alternative questions
   by closed interrogatives, with alternative questions further marked by an or-coordination.
   As noted above, information questions are expressed by finite clauses, direction questions
   by infinitivals.
976         Chapter 11 Content clauses and reported speech
              In the great majority of cases where subordinate interrogatives are found, all six
           categories are permitted. Cases where this is not so are discussed in §§5.3.2–4.","[995, 996]"
"       Pragmatic questions
        Inquiry
        The pragmatic concept of question is an illocutionary category. Prototypically, a ques-
        tion in this sense is an inquiry. To make a (genuine) inquiry is to ask a question to
        which one does not know the answer with the aim of obtaining the answer from the
        addressee. An inquiry can be thought of as effectively a kind of a directive – a direc-
        tive (usually a request) to the addressee to supply the answer. The directive force is
        indirect, however, since the propositional content of the implied directive (“Tell me
        the answer to the question . . .”) is not the same as that which is actually expressed. As
        with the indirect directives discussed in §3.2, the request force can be signalled explic-
        itly in the non-propositional component by the marker please, as in What time is it,
        please?
                                                    § 4.2 Summary classification of questions        867
   Not all questions are inquiries
   The category of question is much broader than that of inquiry. Consider, for example:
   [3]     i A: Ed’s coming round tonight. B: Is he? I didn’t know he was still in London.
          ii What will become of her, I wonder?
         iii What were the names of Henry VIII’s six wives?
         iv How can this problem be overcome? I suggest that the first step is . . .
   Example [i] illustrates the case where a question is used to indicate surprised or interested
   acknowledgement of new information. B’s Is he? is not an inquiry: it doesn’t seek to find
   out the answer, for A has just provided it, and B is not challenging what A has said. In
   [ii] I am wondering, not inquiring – probably not asking for an answer (much less ‘the’
   answer). Question [iii] might be used in a quiz or exam: in this case it’s not an inquiry
   since presumably I already know the answer, my aim being to test whether you do. And
   [iv] is intended as an expository question. Instead of asking you for the answer, I am
   directing your attention to a question whose answer I’m about to give you. Other cases
   of questions that are not inquiries include indirect speech acts like Could you turn your
   radio down a little or Isn’t she fantastic! ([11] of §3), where the question force is secondary
   and very much backgrounded.
       In comparison with a statement, a question on its own is informationally incomplete:
   it needs the answer to complete it. In an utterance with question as its primary force, I
   draw attention to this need for a completing answer. What we are calling an inquiry is
   then the special, but most common, case where I ask you to provide this answer.","[886, 887]"
"         By virtue of the subject–auxiliary inversion, the subordinate clause has the appearance of a
         main clause closed interrogative. This formal resemblance is one reflection of the significant
         semantic resemblances between conditions and questions. Compare:
         [54] i If you’re free this afternoon, we can go and look at some houses.
              ii Are you free this afternoon? If so, we can go and look at some houses.
         The conditional adjunct in [i] entertains two possibilities, one where you’re free this afternoon
         and one where you’re not, and these correspond to the two answers to the polar question in
         [ii]. The second sentence of [ii] begins with an if phrase where so is interpreted in terms of
         the positive answer to the preceding question; for the negative answer we have not (If not, I’ll
         look at the houses on my own). Consider next the following set:
         [55] i Are you sitting comfortably? Then I’ll begin.
              ii He does little himself. He only plans. But his agents are numerous and splendidly or-
                 ganised. Is there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will say, a house to be
                 rifled, a man to be removed – the word is passed to the Professor, the matter is organised
                 and carried out.
             iii Dare a woman have a child, she’s putting her job at risk.
             iv Could he have cast himself in the part of Mr Copthorne, the villain and apostate, he
                 would not have attempted to run away from his captors.
              v Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually,
                 even were he to prove the thief.
         Here [i] (the first words of a radio programme for young children) is like [54ii] except that
         we have then instead of the if phrase in the second sentence: this time a positive answer is
         assumed. In [55ii] (from Conan Doyle’s The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, 1901–3) there is
         no question mark and no following adjunct; the underlined sequence is interpreted like a
         conditional adjunct (“If there is a crime to be done, . . . ”), but its syntactic status is some-
         what obscure: it lies somewhere between [i], which is clearly an interrogative expressing a
         question, and [iii–v], which are conditional adjuncts. Example [iii] is unusual in that we
         have here an open conditional: these inverted conditional adjuncts normally occur in remote
         conditionals (except when introduced by modal should: see §7.1.2). For this reason, [iii] is not
                                                  § 4.8 Complement of a preposition or adverb           971
   sharply different from [ii], though the latter does not represent an established construction in
   Present-day English, for is cannot introduce inverted conditionals. In [iv–v] we have remote
   conditionals, with [iv] a rare example of inversion with modal could. In [v] the irrealis form
   were and even more strikingly the focusing adverb even make the underlined clause clearly
   distinct from an interrogative. There is no doubt, then, that inversion can serve as a marker of a
   conditional, and that [iii–v] are not interrogative clauses but belong to the default declarative
   type of content clause.","[990, 991]"
"       Questioning of modality
        In general, modality is more readily questioned by a predication than a modification
        construction. Compare:
       [12] i a. Are they likely to be offended?             b. #Will they probably be offended?
            ii a. Is it possible that he was poisoned?       b. Was he perhaps poisoned?
        In [i] the [a] version is very strongly preferred over [b], which is very unnatural in most
        contexts. And in [ii], while [a] clearly questions the modality, the perhaps in [b] is likely
        to be construed as outside the scope of the question: I’m asking if he was poisoned,
        with perhaps indicating that I think that his having been poisoned is a possibility to be
        considered.
                                                                       § 17 Evaluative adjuncts       771
     Nevertheless, there are certainly cases where a modal adjunct is in the scope of a
  question. Will he probably die? seems quite reasonable, and Won’t he probably die? is
  fully acceptable; the negative question here is biased towards the positive answer He
  will probably die. Similarly, examples like [11], or their positive counterparts, can readily
  be questioned. Because epistemic necessarily predominantly occurs in the scope of a
  negative, a question like Are those who do best at school necessarily the cleverest? is typically
  biased towards a negative answer.","[790, 791]"
"       Restriction on fronting of interrogative phrase
           In multi-variable questions where the variables are not coordinate, no more than one
           interrogative phrase can be fronted:
       [19] i They did what to whom?
            ii What did they do to whom?
           iii ∗What to whom did they do?
       8
           Bare infinitivals with how are occasionally attested, but they are of questionable acceptability: ?How leave the
           matter rest? The interpretation is similar to those with why, suggesting that there is no way in which one could
           reasonably leave the matter rest.
                                                                        § 4.5 Variable questions       875
 Answers to multi-variable questions
  Multi-variable questions may have either singulary answers or multiple answers:
 [20] i Who beat who?
      ii Kim beat Max.                                                         [singulary answer]
     iii Kim beat Max and Pat beat Bob.                                         [multiple answer]
  A singulary answer simply provides a single value for each variable. A multiple answer
  provides sets of values – pairs if there are two variables, triples if there are three, and so on.
  Thus for “x beat y” in question [20i], the singulary answer [ii] provides the value “Kim”
  for “x ” and “Max” for “y”, whereas the multiple answer [iii] provides the pairs {“Kim”,
  “Max”} and {“Pat”, “Bob”} for the variable pair {“x”, “y”}. For example, [ii] might be
  the answer when the question is used to inquire about the final match in some sporting
  competition, [iii] when it is used to inquire about the semi-finals.
     A two-variable question with multiple answers can be used as an inquiry in a range
  of contexts differing with respect to what information I already have, as opposed to that
  which I am seeking to obtain:
 [21] i I don’t know the values of either variable.
      ii I know the values of one variable but not the other.
     iii I know the values for both variables, but not how they are paired.
  Answer [20iii] would be used under condition [21i] when I simply know that two
  matches took place but don’t know who the players were, or I know who played but
  not who won or lost. A context where [21ii] applies would be one where I know who has
  won through to the final but want to know who they beat in the semi-finals. Context
  [21iii] would obtain if I knew who was playing in the semi-finals and ask Who beat
  who? to find out the results. Or [21iii] might similarly apply to the answer to such a
  question as Who’s going to teach which courses this semester? A likely context for this
  is the planning of a teaching-programme when we know who the teaching staff are
  and what the courses are: it is then just a matter of matching teachers with courses.","[894, 895]"
"
       9.6 Shall
      9.6.1 Deontic modality
           Three deontic uses of shall are seen in:
           [42] i The committee shall meet at least four times per year.       [constitutive/regulative]
                ii You shall have your money back tomorrow.                       [speaker’s guarantee]
               iii Shall I close the window?                                        [direction-seeking]
        (a) The constitutive/regulative use
            This is used in constitutions, regulations, and similar legal or quasi-legal documents.
            The subject is normally 3rd person.       (b) Speaker’s guarantee
           In [42ii] I give an undertaking that you will get your money back: I put myself under
           an obligation to ensure that the situation is actualised. This use is relatively uncommon
           and differs from the central cases of deontic modality in that the obligation is placed on
           the speaker. It is found with 2nd and 3rd person subjects.
                                                                     § 9.6.2 Non-deontic uses and shall vs will                 195
  (c) Shall in direction questions
      Example [42iii] is what we call a direction question (Ch. 10, §4.6): I’m asking you to
      tell me whether to close the window or not. The prototypical answer is an imperative
      (e.g. Yes, please do), not a declarative with shall. This use occurs mainly with 1st person
      subjects, and for many varieties will would be quite impossible here with this meaning.","[214, 215]"
"4.7.3 Negative interrogative questions
    Questions with negative interrogative form are always strongly biased. They typically
    allow a range of interpretations, and the epistemic bias can be towards either the negative
    or the positive answer. Consider:
    [42]    Didn’t I tell you Kim would be coming?
    One context for this is where it has become apparent that I have, or probably have,
    omitted to tell you that Kim would be coming. Here the bias is towards the negative
    answer (I didn’t tell you). But I could equally use [42] in a context where I remember
    quite well having said that Kim would be coming: my prediction was not accepted at the
    time but has now been shown by Kim’s presence to have been correct and I am asking
    you to admit that I was right. Here, then, the bias is towards the positive answer (that I
    did tell you).
       Similarly with such examples as:
    [43] i Wasn’t I right?
         ii Isn’t it all as simple as she predicted?
        iii Aren’t they spending Christmas with their uncle?
        iv Isn’t it raining?
    For [i] possible interpretations are: “It appears that I wasn’t right – is that so?” (negative
    epistemic bias) and “It is now evident I was right – admit it” (positive). For [ii]: “It is
    looking as though it is not as simple as she predicted, isn’t it?” (negative) and “It has
    turned out just as simple as she said it would, hasn’t it?” (positive). For [iii]: “It seems
    I was wrong in thinking they are spending Christmas with their uncle” (negative) and
    “Remember they are spending Christmas with their uncle” (positive). A context for this
    latter, positively biased, interpretation could be one where you have suggested inviting
    them over for Christmas and I point out that they won’t be able to come because they will
    be away at their uncle’s – another case where a question is used not to obtain information
    but to indirectly impart it. For [iv], a negatively biased interpretation is “I thought it was
    raining but there is now evidence suggesting it is not” (for example, you may be showing
    signs of going out without protection against rain), and a positively biased one is “Let
    me remind you that it’s raining” (e.g. in response to Why aren’t you going out? – “Surely
    the fact that it is raining is reason enough!”).
        Negative interrogative questions typically suggest some element of contrast. We will
    consider this feature first in cases where the bias is negative, and then in those where it
    is positive.",[903]
"      10
         In neither interpretation is You shall get your money back an answer; with a 2nd or 3rd person subject shall
         indicates commitment on the part of the speaker, rather than obligation on the part of the subject-referent
         (cf. Ch. 3, §9.6.1). The positive answers to the two readings of [28] are therefore Get your money back and You
         will get your money back.
      11
         We are concerned here with indirect reported speech, where one reports the content of what was said rather
         than the actual words, but for present purposes we can consider the idealised case where there is the closest
         possible match. The embedded infinitival construction does not always correspond to an unembedded shall
         question. How shall I turn the machine on? is hardly idiomatic whereas I don’t know how to turn the machine
         on is; nevertheless, the answers to the infinitival question involve directions for turning the machine on.
                                                                                         § 4.7 Biased questions    879
         If I use a direction question to ask you to tell me what to do, then the issue of whether
      the answer given is right or wrong is trivial. Consider, for example:
   [30]         A: Shall I call a taxi for you?           B: No, thanks. I’ll enjoy the walk.
      A’s question is an indirect offer, and it is up to B to accept or reject. The issue of whether
      the directive answer is right or wrong is comparable to that of whether a statement like
      I promise to help you, when used to make a promise, is true or false. This latter issue
      is trivial because the statement is made true simply by virtue of its being uttered with
      the relevant intention, and similarly B’s directive answer to the direction question in
      [30] will be right simply by virtue of B’s deciding to deliver that directive rather than
      another.
          There are also cases, however, where the issue of what the right answer is to a direction
      question can arise in a non-trivial way. For example, such questions can be used to ask
      for advice:
   [31]        A: Shall I take a taxi?                    B: No, you’d be better off walking.
      Here it is easy to imagine circumstances under which B could be said to have given bad
      advice, given the wrong answer – e.g., if the distance were too great for A to be able to
      walk it comfortably in the time available. Similarly when one puts a direction question
      to oneself, in wondering: what the right answer is in this case is of course a crucial issue.
      Determining what is the right answer to direction questions used to seek advice or in
      wondering involves a judgement as to what course of action is in the best interests of
      the one uttering the question (or, in shall we questions, of the group containing that
      person).","[898, 899]"
"        Contexts where do so is excluded or disfavoured relative
        to ellipsis (or pro-form do)
        (a) Do so does not admit contrastive complements
        [39]    I didn’t invite Kim, but I did Pat / ∗but I did so Pat.
         The did of I did Pat does not correspond to a full VP, but only to the verb, and Pat is object
         of an understood invite, contrasting with Kim in the preceding clause; do so, however,
         must substitute for a VP consisting at least of the verb and its complements.
        (b) Do so is inadmissible in comparative constructions
        [40] i She earns more than I do / ∗than I do so.
             ii He thought it was good, as I did / ∗as I did so.
        (c) Do so cannot in general be anaphoric to a stative VP
        [41] He liked it; at least he said he did / ∗did so.
         Like denotes a state, and as such cannot head the antecedent of do so, which must be
         dynamic.
        (d) Do so excluded or disfavoured in various tags and responses,
        and in non-anaphoric use
        [42] i Jill had written it, hadn’t she? / ∗hadn’t she done so?
             ii A: Jill had written it. B: Had she? / ∗Had she done so?
            iii A: Jill had written it. B: No she hadn’t. / ∗No she hadn’t done so.
            iv A: Had Jill written it? B: Yes, she had. / ∗Yes, she had done so.
             v [No antecedent]               Don’t! / ∗Don’t do so!
         Ellipsis (or primary forms of pro-form do) must be used in preference to do so in
         interrogative tags ([i]), and in responses such as those illustrated in [ii–iv]. In [ii]
         B responds to A’s statement with the corresponding polar question, either to acknowl-
         edge that the information is new and somewhat surprising or to challenge the truth
         of A’s statement. In [iii] B contradicts A’s statement, and in [iv] answers A’s polar
         question. In all of [i–iv], then, the issue is simply yes or no, and in such contexts
         the version with the greater reduction of the VP is required. Similarly in the non-
         anaphoric use of reduction illustrated in [v], where the interpretation derives from
         salience in the context of utterance rather than from a linguistic antecedent: it may
         be, for example, that you are about to hit your young brother and I’m telling you
         not to. We have noted that this use of ellipsis is rare, but do so does not permit it
         at all.
                                                                                    § 7.5 Do so   1531
  (e) Do so is disfavoured in chaining and with crossed anaphoric links
  [43] i A: Are you going to help them? I think you should . B: I may          ; I’d certainly
          like to , but I’m not sure I can .
       ii A: You should phone heri and ask if she has finished j . B: I will   i , but
          I’m pretty sure she hasn’t j .
  Ellipsis lends itself to repetition much more readily than do so, which would be unnatural
  though not ungrammatical in examples like these. In [i] we have an anaphoric chain,
  while in [ii] the anaphoric links cut across each other: the missing complement of will
  is linked to phone her and that of hasn’t to finished.","[1550, 1551]"
"          27
               A further case of mismatch between syntactic and semantic scope is to be found in the position of adverbs.
               Although the order illustrated in He must always/never have filed the letters represents the usual one, it is also
               possible to have the adverb before the auxiliary, as in He never/always must have filed the letters. Must here
               has its epistemic sense, roughly “I am forced to conclude”. And it is clear that the frequency adverbs relate
               semantically to the filing, not to the epistemic judgement: the meaning is “I am forced to conclude that he
               always/never filed the letters”, not “I am always/never forced to conclude that he filed the letters”. Semantically,
               then, it is comparable to He promised always to do his best, although the order matches that of He always
               promised to do his best: the semantic contrast between the two promise examples is lost with must.

      The argument has both a negative and a positive side to it. The negative side involves re-
      considering the differences between ask and have presented in the last section as supporting
      a dependent-auxiliary analysis, and showing that on closer examination they do not in fact
      do so. The positive side involves introducing other phenomena which can be handled more
      satisfactorily under the catenative analysis.(a) The distinction between argument and non-argument subjects
      The first point we made was that while ask takes an argument subject, have does not. But as
      we in fact noted when discussing this difference, it isn’t only auxiliary verbs that take non-
      argument subjects: verbs such as seem, appear, begin, tend do so too. The following examples
      with seem thus match the above ones with perfect have in [13–15]:28                                                                  
  [22] i a. Kim seemed to intimidate the PM.
                                                                                    [voice-neutral: a = b]
          b. The PM seemed to be intimidated by Kim.

          b. There seemed to be a mistake in the proof.                                 [there permitted]
          It is also important to note that the concept of catenative can be applied to adjectives as
      well as to verbs. Adjectives like certain, likely, eager, keen take non-finite complements, and
      can be chained together recursively in the same way as catenative verbs: cf. She is likely to be
      keen to accept or (with a mixture of verbs and adjectives in a chain of four catenatives) She
      is likely to at least appear to be keen to try to win. And catenative adjectives show the same
      split between those that take argument subjects and those that take non-argument subjects.
      Compare:                                                                      
  [23] i a. Kim was keen to interview the PM.
                                                                                   [voice-sensitive: a = b]
          b. The PM was keen to be interviewed by Kim.                                                                       
       ii a. Kim was likely to intimidate the PM.
                                                                                    [voice-neutral: a = b]
          b. The PM was likely to be intimidated by Kim.
         Furthermore, this split is to be found in the class of auxiliaries too: it is not quite true
      that all auxiliaries take non-argument subjects, for dare and the would of would rather take
      argument subjects:                                                              
  [24] i a. Neither dare interview the PM.
                                                                               [voice-sensitive: a = b]
         b. The PM daren’t be interviewed by either.
       ii ∗The piano-lid daren’t be open.                                  [selection restrictions apply]
      iii ∗There daren’t be any dust on the piano.                             [dummy there excluded]
         What we find, then, is the cross-classification shown in:
  [25]        argument subject                      non-argument subject
            i dare, would (rather)                  be, can, have, may, need                   [auxiliaries]
           ii expect, hope, try, want               appear, begin, seem, tend                [lexical verbs]
          iii anxious, determined, keen             apt, certain, liable, likely                [adjectives]
      The contrast in the semantic relation to the subject thus provides no basis for treating
      auxiliaries differently from lexical verbs. Moreover, the behaviour of dare and would (rather)
      is inconsistent with the dependent-auxiliary analysis: they are clearly heads, not dependents.(b) Negation
      Although the core auxiliary construction normally has just one negation, the possibility does
      in fact exist for contrasts in syntactic as well as semantic scope and for negating more than 28
      We have changed the non-finite complement of [13] because both Kim seemed to interview the PM and The
      PM seemed to be interviewed by Kim sound somewhat unnatural. They are equivalent, nevertheless.
1216         Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
            one verb at a time. Compare:
        [26] i She can’t always answer his questions, can she?                         [negation of can]
               ii She can always not answer his questions, can’t she?               [negation of answer]
              iii She can’t always not answer his questions, can she?          [negation of both verbs]
        There is an equivalence between [i] and It isn’t always possible for her to answer his questions,
        is it? : the negation clearly includes the can/possible within its scope semantically, and the
        interrogative tag shows that it does so syntactically too – the standard type of tag reverses
        the polarity of the clause to which it attaches (cf. Ch. 9, §1.1).
            By contrast, [26ii] is equivalent to It is always possible for her not to answer his ques-
        tions, isn’t it? (“to refrain from answering”), where the can/possible is now outside the
        scope of the negative, hence positive, as reflected in the negative tag. And [iii] is equiv-
        alent to It is not possible for her to always not answer his questions, is it? The two neg-
        atives here do not of course cancel each other out because they are negating different
        verbs; the tag is the same as in [i], because it is determined by the polarity of the can
        clause.
            The always in these examples makes it easy to see the scope of the negatives. If we omit
        it, there is no longer anything in the linear sequence of elements alone to determine the
        scope: She + can + not + answer his questions could in principle have either the first or
        second interpretation. The second requires a special prosodic reading in which there is a
        break after can and the not is closely linked to answer ; in writing cannot would force the
        first interpretation, whereas can not would tend to be used for the second. An inflectional
        negative always indicates that the negative has syntactic scope over that verb: She can’t answer
        his questions unambiguously has the first interpretation.
            The same range of possibilities is even available with perfect have:
        [27] i He has not always accepted bribes, has he?                                        [negation of have]
             ii He has always not accepted bribes, hasn’t he?                                  [negation of accept]
            iii He has not always not accepted bribes, has he?                             [negation of both verbs]
            Have is negated in [i] and [iii], where has not is replaceable by inflectional hasn’t, but in
            [ii] the have clause is positive (as evident from the tag), and the not belongs syntactically as
            well as semantically with accept : “It has always been his practice to not accept (i.e. to refuse)
            bribes”.
                Examples like [26ii/27ii] are just like the earlier [16iib] (She asked not to be included in
            the survey), and the catenative analysis enables them to be handled in just the same way, as
            non-finite complement negation, secondary negation in the sense of Ch. 9, §2.3. This is not
            possible in the dependent-auxiliary analysis, where they have to be treated as exceptions. The
            above contrasts show that the proposed VGp does not in fact form a unit with a single syntactic
            negation. It is true that examples like [i] represent the normal pattern, but the catenative
            analysis caters more satisfactorily for the range of options that the verbal system makes
            available.29 (It should also be borne in mind that in the ordinary catenative construction
            negation of the matrix is much more frequent than negation of the complement.) Other       29
            Attested examples of the construction shown in [iii] are rare, but the following is a slightly more complex
            version of it: Not since 1992 had Sampras not taken at least one among the Australian Open, French Open,
            Wimbledon and the US Open. The initial negative phrase negates the have clause, while the second not negates
            the take clause.
