"10.5.1 Polar interrogatives
Polar interrogatives are those that seek an expression of affirmation or negation of
the truth of the questioned proposition. The response sought to a polar interrogative
is either an affirmation or negation of the proposition. There are no words for 'yes'
and 'no' in the interrogative context. This is achieved by means of an echo system,
i.e. the partial repetition of the predicate. A sub-type is the alternative interrogative
(Sadock and Zwicky 1985), which provides a list of constituents, or a proposition
and its negation, to which the respondent must make a choice. There are three
interrogative morphemes associated with polar interrogatives: tah ' Q \ expressing
doubt, 'who knows', 'maybe' (§10.5.1.1); kah 'ALT' expressing possible alternatives
andbeh 'NO' the external negator meaning 'or not?' (§10.5.1.2).",[353]

"  When the complement of do 'OF' is the ignorative kadeh 'who', it forms the
possessor interrogative 'whose' (§6.2.4.1). do 'OF' is often repeated following the
question word (127) in a 'sandwich construction' (§8.2).

        OF     who        OF
        Whose (is it)?
The response to this question is to use do 'OF' and the possessor noun, or the
contracted form prefixed to the pronoun.
  The distal demonstrative ke - kke 'that' (128), and the deictic locative ha? 'AT'
(129), may occur as complements of do 'OF'. The phrase functions as a discourse
deictic indicating something previously mentioned (§6.3.3). The proximate
demonstrative no? 'this' is never used in this way.(128)   yok     sarek,        dom, sbeji, dom             d?oh      thay    do        kke

usually uttered in agreement or affirmation of an accompanying statement, made
either by the speaker or the addressee, as in (25) below. (See §10.5.1.3 for responses
to polar interrogatives.)
   khe? 'who knows?', is used to express a lack of interest or even annoyance
towards someone's question. It is the verb 'to know', uttered in a curt manner, with
an emphasis on the aspiration of the initial segment, and accompanied by rising
intonation.

"Hi. The mirative in interrogative clauses The irrealis can occur in interrogative
clauses of the information type. This is in contrast to examples of the interrogative
examined in the literature which all involve polar interrogatives (Mithun 1995,
Givon 1994), and not information interrogatives as is the case here. Givon attributes
the presence of the irrealis in polar questions to the epistemic sub-mode of low
certainty (1994: 273). Cross-linguistically, there are two options behind the
motivation for the irrealis in interrogatives: a) the interrogative can show the same
sort of sensitivity to mood as the declarative, real or unreal; or b) it can consistently
mark all interrogatives as irrealis on the basis that they have not been realised. The
latter is not the case in Semelai as all interrogatives with the exception of those
discussed here are generally in the realis.
   In Semelai the presence of the irrealis in an interrogative clause could express one
of two things: a) mirative, a speaker-based expression of an event counter to
normality, or b) inferred, where the speaker cannot infer the person's motive. Either3
    The motivation for the presence of/a/ in the imperfective form of jrjok 'to see' is unclear.
290    10 Basic clausesinterpretation is plausible. The questions are based on the speaker's direct perception
of an unanticipated situation, as illustrated below. When ma= is procliticised to the
verb it forms an interrogative which speakers consider to be impolite, expressing
vexation toward the referent. These are direct questions where the referent is the
second person, with the exception of the rhetorical question in (94), my sole
example of first person usage.
(94)    The speaker, who is repeatedly scrubbing at a garment, is vexed by her effort, and
        asks herself out loud:
        brapa?        tan      Ian ma=brus?
        how.many instance want IRR=scrub.cloth
        How many times do (I) need to scrub (it)?
In the following example, someone has turned up at the speaker's house
unexpectedly, and they enquire as to the visitor's purpose:

        what            REL=lRR=seek reach AT here
        I can't infer what (it is) that (you) would be seeking, turning (up) here?
This construction is also used in the relativisation of affective states:
(96)    The speaker cannot imagine what possible difficulty could have prevented the
        addressee from achieving his goal.
        dmoh        md=ma=susah?

"  The negative marker, beh 'NO' can be included in a response. In agreeing with the
negative question in (293), and the negative portion in (287) above, the external
negator beh 'NO' is used along with an internally negated clause.",[356]
"It is also used in a negated existential clause to express 'nowhere'. This would
constitute a negative response to the question above in (87):(92)   ""da? da?    h3n""

"10.5.1.3 Responses to polar interrogatives
The response sought to a polar interrogative is achieved through an 'echo' system,
the partial repetition of the predicate. This may be either the verb (288)-(289),
aspect (290) or whatever constituent is relevant to the question (291).

not the superordinate, eliciting specific type in terms of class membership. This is
the only construction in which nmoh is used. The ignorative appears to be derived
with the nominalising prefix n- 'INDIV': nmoh (n-hmoh INDIV-what). Note here that
it is not the NP, but the ignorative which hosts the affix, compared to examples (38)
and (39) in the previous section.

   In (42) the question being asked is 'To which domain does that animal belong?'
The answer would be in terms of a superordinate classification (a), or a basic

"The response is based on the clause nucleus rather than the tag (§10.5.1.3). Although
the question presents two propositions to the respondent, there is an element of bias
in interrogatives of this type, in that the interrogator appears to expect a negative

"6.2.5   PLACE
PLACE is expressed by the ignorative h5n     in both interrogative and indefinite
contexts. Synthetic compounds derived from hon and directional prepositions
express 'whither' and 'whence' and in the indefinite pronoun function, a free-choice
compound 'whoever'.
6.2.5.1 Interrogative h5n * where'
h3n 'where' is used to seek information about PLACE. h5n is inherently locative and
therefore does not require a locative preposition (82). In contrast, a locative
preposition must be used to express 'whence' and a directional preposition must be
used to express 'whither'.

In this context, the pronominal can be encliticised with the interjection ho? 'ATTN':
?a=keh=ho? and?a=deh=ho?. ho? was characterised by speakers as being polite or
pleasant. It expresses an appreciation on the part of the respondent towards the other
parties' expression of interest. Elsewhere, ho? is uttered on presenting someone with
something, or as an interjection 'look out!', e.g. if someone is about to inadvertently
step on something (§13.2).

  The choice of directional is dependent on the verb type. A verb like swak 'to go',
or gor) 'to carry' is not specified for direction, so any of the directionals can
co-occur with it. Verbs with inherent direction can also co-occur with the
corresponding deictic locative. In this case, the choice between directional and
deictic locative reflects a variation in the perspective on the event. In (94a) the use
of te?en 'TO:down' puts the focus on the motion of falling in terms of the trajectory
of the event; in contrast in (94b) the focus is on the location of landing, or the
endpoint.
(94)    (a) kdhn grdk te?en           ?ate           (94b) kehn grak co?             ?ate

"  A compound of the word b&rt>i) 'thing' and h5n 'where' is used to express an
unspecified location or locations, corresponding to the English free-choice pronoun
'wherever'. Again, with the free-choice pronoun there is a degree of ambiguity, and
a universal sense, 'everywhere', is also possible.
(93)   ken     no?,    bDrorj-hon   jr-jt>r
       3       this    thing-where IMPERF-urinate

       Esoteric knowledge, incantations (and) whatever, he sought wherever/everywhere.
  Finally, it is worth mentioning an idiomatic compound which is used to express
realisation in response to visual stimuli 'to look like'. Interestingly, this is not
embedded under a verb of perception or cognition, the presence of gay a
'appearance' from Malay gaya 'form, manner' rendering it implicit.
(95)   A woman climbs down from a tiger's back to take a drink from the stream. For the
       first time he realises that she is pregnant.

6.2, are distinguished by their general lack of corresponding indefinite pronoun
function, so that a correlation may be drawn between an increase in morphological
complexity corresponding to a decrease in functional range.
6.2.1.2 Ignoratives as indefinite pronouns
As revealed in Table 6.2 above, there are no lexemes which function uniquely as
indefinite pronouns in Semelai. These concepts are expressed either by: a) a
basic/simple ignorative; b) a generic-ontological-category noun functioning as an
ignorative, or c) a combination of the generic noun and a basic ignorative. The
generic nouns employed most frequently in this manner are sma? 'person' and
bDrt>rj 'thing' <— Malay barang 'things in general'.
   It is not always easy to ascertain whether the noun is actually grammaticised as an
indefinite pronoun, although when used in the indefinite pronoun function, the
generic noun never co-occurs with markers of referentiality, e.g. demonstratives, or
classifiers. In contrast, the negative indefinite pronoun may have a classifier:
178    6 Pronouns: personal, ignorative, and demonstrative(29)     me=?ikur     sma?     da?      da?
         one=CLF      person   NEG      EXIST
         There wasn't a single person. (Or: There was no-one.)
A generic noun is not used to express unspecified place or time.
   Cross-linguistically, indefinite pronouns express a range of complex semantic
distinctions (Haspelmath 1997: 3) and this appears to be borne out in many, but not
all, of the ontological categories in SemelaL Whilst the main context of indefinite
pronoun usage is to express indefiniteness, they are also used here in contexts where
they may express free choice, i.e. having a semantically non-specific referent, as
well as contexts which are characterised in terms of existence, or more usually,
non-existence, i.e. negative indefinite pronouns.
   The lack of specificity associated with the free-choice and negative-context
indefinites may be distinguished formally by the reduplication of the root, e.g.
mande-mande 'anything'.
   Free-choice pronouns actually represent free choice within a restricted domain,
where the referent must be a token of the same type, for example in (30), the token
must belong to the domain of culinary dishes.
(30)     ki=masak pay          ninca, hue, mande-mande
         3A=cook for.now food          rice   RDP-what.sort
         She cooked the food for now,rice(and) whatever.
Two free-choice pronouns take the form of a compound combining the lexeme
bDrDrj 'thing' and PLACE h5n, bDrorj-hon 'whereever', and with 'person'
borDrj-kadeh 'whoever'. bt>rt>rj is from the Malay barang 'things in general', as
noted above. The compound appears to represent a caique of an archaic form of
question words in Malay, e.g. barang apa 'whatever', barang siapa 'whoever', but
which are no longer common, at least in the standard variety of Malay (Mintz 1994:
118).
  There are no distinct negative pronoun forms, this function being achieved by
placing an ignorative in a negated existential construction:
(31)     ""?eh"" khldrj,    ""da?     da?      mande       md=ki=ca                la=bsi?""
         ah      QUOTE NEG         EXIST what.sort REL=3A=penetrate             A=metal
         ""Ah,"" (he) thought, ""there's nothing that the metal can penetrate.""","[205, 206]"
"II. Constituent order The two possible orderings of constituents in the existential
clause are motivated by the representation of old/new information. If the existent NP
represents new information, it follows the predicator da? NP (LOC); if the NP
represents old information, e.g. in response to a question, it precedes the predicator:
NP da? (LOC). In both instances, the LOC is in clause-final position.
   NP final order is used for non-specific NPs to introduce a new NP (32) or, with an
established participant, to introduce a new event or state (33).(32)   ""?ma? ye=?en"" khlerj, ""khoy nehneh. da?                     da?     kba?""

       ""Our mother,"" (they) said, ""(is) only a head. (She) doesn't have a body.""(33)   sirag   jtek,    ki=?yot       kantup        la=pathir      ke
       while   sleep    3A=return     close.over    A=tree.sp.     that       jadi?,    da?      da?     keh.
       happen NEG         EXIST 3
       While (he was) sleeping, the pathir tree closed back over, (and so it ) happened
       (that) he wasn't there (anymore).",[303]
"6.2.7 QUANTITY
The quantitative category is expressed by brapa? 'how much/many', brapa? 'how
much/many' is used for both animate and inanimate referents, the same form being
used regardless of whether count or mass nouns are involved.
   brapa? 'QUANTITY' is a borrowing from Malay berapa 'how much/many'. There
is no indigenous equivalent for this term.
   In both interrogative and indefinite functions, the ignorative is always followed by
a noun or stative verb which defines the quantity in question.
(99)    brapa?     tan    ji=k<m>lDm?
        how.many time      2A=carry.sth.long.on.shoulder<lMPERF>
        How many times were you carrying (it)?
Some of these terms are listed below, including dimension and measure nouns, and
classifiers (§§7.3.2-3):
                     'weight'(be.heavy<NMZ>)       brapa? k<h>jeh   'how heavy'
        ny-thay      *size'(<NMZ>be.big)           brapa? ny-thdy   'how big'
        n?-le?       *time'(<NMZ>be.long)          brapa? n?-le?    'how much time'
        ?ikur        'animate being, CLF'          brapa? ?ikur     'how many people/
                                                                    animals'6
 This form is possibly influenced by the Malay terms for 'how': macam mana (like where) and
bagaimana (how) which also contain the 'place' category mana 'where'.
                                                                        6.2 Ignoratives 191

        be.)6.2.3   PROPERTY; REASONmande is the only ignorative which encodes more than one ontological category. It
expresses the category PROPERTY, 'what sort of and also REASON 'because of what'.
The choice between these interpretations is dependent on the context. The
distinction is apparent in its syntactic distribution: in its PROPERTY function mande
exhibits the syntactic distribution of the referent, e.g. as the adnominal constituent in
182    6 Pronouns: personal, ignorative, and demonstrativean associative phrase (47), whilst in the REASON function it is always clause-initial,
an adjunct to the proposition (48).
(47)    A woman is curious as to how her estranged husband has managed to reach her
        home which is located in the lurj 'the area between the earth and the sky'.
        ?end:>l,     ki=tajia? rom mande               trorj.

         why     NEG MID-put.away chicken DEM-AT
         Why haven't these chickens here been put away?
The interrogative functions are examined first in §§6.2.3.1-2 and the indefinite
function in §6.2.3.3.
6.2.3.1 PROPERTY mande 'what sort of
mande 'what sort o f is used to seek information about the general properties of
animate (both human and non-human), inanimate and abstract referents: 'what are
the attributes of X', as opposed to the identifying domain or class membership
discussed in §6.2.2.1. As mentioned previously, the ignorative is normally placed
following the head in the position occupied by the adnominal.
(49)     The information sought is a description of the person in terms of distinguishing
        features.
        Q: ""sma?         mande?""
              person     what.sort

         Q:    ""What sort of person (is she)?""
         A:    ""(She is) a head-person, (she) has no body, only a head.""
Note the contextual ambiguity which arises between the translation 'of what' and
'what kind o f when inalienable possession is involved, as in the following two
examples, which both happen to be riddles.
(50)    ?ec        mande       m*=da?       sTit?
        excreta what.sort REL=NEG stink
        What sort of faeces (is) the one that doesn't stink?
        The answer to the riddle is ?ec dre (?*c 'excreta, bodily waste products', dre
        4
          rattan') 'rattan shavings', the by-product ofpeeling rattan.
(51)    mat     mande       da?      ?ye     sma??
        eye      what.sort NEG see           person
        What sort (of) eyes don't see people?
        The answer to the riddle is mot tarja? (eye stair) 'step'. More riddles can be found
        in §14.1.
In (52) the ignorative is the complement of the modifying locative prepositional
phrase. Interestingly, the ignorative associated with the attributive is used here rather
than the locative PLACE form.
                                                                       6.2 Ignoratives 183

fact that the referent 'existence, life' is abstract. The question is rhetorical.

mande 'why' expresses reason, both purpose and cause, and does not distinguish
between the two. It is only attested in interrogative contexts.
  mande is always clause-initial when the intended ontological category is REASON,
possibly due to the fact that it has scope over the whole proposition and not simply
one constituent within it.

Section 14.1 is a selection of ttikyan 'riddles'; §14.2 consists of excerpts from an
elderly woman's autobiographical narrative; in §14.3 a man talks about the
differences between Semelai practices of the present day, and those of previous
generations, and in §14.4 a collection of four cnnman 'traditional narratives' is
presented.
  The texts are presented in the same format as the examples. Note that where the
text is bracketed [ ] an exchange takes place between a member of the audience and
the principal narrator.
14.1 ttikyan 'Riddles'
To 'tell riddles' is b-ttikyan.The term comes from the Malay teka teki 'riddles,
brain-teasers'. If one doesn't know the answer to a riddle, one replies with ?apacom
?ahem. Speakers were unable to gloss this construction, only transliterate it as da?
ye=khe? 'I don't know (it)'.
  The following riddles were collected in a group situation from an extended
family, ranging from an elderly couple to their young grandchildren. The session
began spontaneously when we were sitting around one evening and someone
happened to ask me one of these riddles. Everyone then proceeded to join in, taking
great delight in my attempts to come up with the correct answers.
  Each clue is presented here together with the answer (A:). The riddles are not only
entertaining, but provide interesting insights into the Semelai perception of their
environment. Explanatory notes are provided where necessary.

"622 THING
The range of choices available for expressing the ontological category THING are
mandehmoh, and its variants hmoh, dmoh and jmoh. These are used with
non-human animate, inanimate and abstract referents in interrogative contexts to
seek knowledge about identity. Only mandehmDh is used in indefinite contexts.
   Although mandehmoh appears to be morphologically complex, a compound of
mande 'what sort o f and hmoh, it is difficult to provide an insightful analysis,
whilst being unable to draw a semantic distinction between mandehmoh and its
variant forms. The general unavailability of the form to be used in indefinite
contexts does suggest that it is complex, although this observation may reflect a gap
in the corpus rather than being a valid claim about the functional possibilities of the
term.
6.2.2.1 Interrogative 'what'
The most general term used for 'THING' is mande(hmoh) 'what', jmoh is a form
only used by the elderly and, according to speakers, is the equivalent of dmoh.
However, I was unable to establish any motivation in terms of the function of the
various forms. A specific form is used to seek information regarding identity in
terms of class membership: nmoh 'what class' (see below). The derived
interrogative j<nh>moh (WHAT<NMZ>) 'what say' <— jmoh 'what' is used to ask a
speaker to repeat something that the hearer has not heard properly:
(33)   j<nh>moh      nerj?
       what<NMZ> before
       What was that (you said) before?
i. mandehmoh 'what* mandehmoh and its variants exhibit a tendency to be used
when the referent is the subject of a non-verbal clause (34), or a subcategorised core
argument of the verb (35), including clausal objects.

       what REL=2fA=seek-lTER
       What do you keep on seeking?
In (34) and (35) the referent of mandemoh and dmoh is an entitiy; in the following
clauses, the ignoratives have an event as the referent:

"2.5.3 Syllable structure
Aslian languages have strong monosyllabic tendencies, although disyllabic and

languages also exhibit true disyllabic words:
         /garuc/     'termite' (Temiar)
         /kaltorj/   'knee' (Semelai)
         /cu?e:c/    'to be inquisitive about something' (Semai)
All syllables must have an initial consonant. Any consonant phoneme may fill this
position. The inventory of final segments is smaller than that of the initials, with
voiceless aspirates and voiced consonants disallowed. Temiar, and some dialects of
Semai represent a new innovation in the Aslian languages, with a set of final voiced
consonants Benjamin (1976b): /gab/ 'Malay' compared to Semelai /gap/ 'Malay'.
Final oral stops are always unreleased.
  Southern languages have final open syllables as opposed to the closed syllables of
other groups: e.g. Semelai /co/ 'dog', /t h i/ 'hand' compared to Jah Hut /cud?/
'dog' and /tig/ 'hand' and Mah Men /ke/ 'to fall (of fruit)' compared to Cheq
Wong /kar/ of the same meaning (Kruspe fieldnotes).","[87, 88]"

1.2 The Aslian languages
Aslian languages are a sub-group of the Mon-Khmer language family. Along with
Munda, Mon-Khmer is one of the two divisions that forms the Austroasiatic phylum.
Austroasiatic languages are spread throughout mainland Southeast Asia, Northeast
India and the Nicobar Islands.
  The Austroasiatic languages have a long presence in this area, predating the
Sino-Tibetan, Tai-Kadai, Miao-Yao, Austronesian, Dravidian and Indo-European
families with which they coexist today. With the exception of three Mon-Khmer
languages, Vietnamese, Khmer and Khasi (Assam, India), the languages are spoken
by ethnic minorities.
  The Mon-Khmer language family extends from Vietnam in the east, to Northeast
India in the west, and from Southern China in the north, to the Aslian languages in the
south, Semelai and Mah Meri (Besisi) being the southernmost members of the family.
Mon-Khmer is divided into twelve branches (Diffloth and Zide 1992), although the
preciserelationshipbetween the twelve is yet to be ascertained. As stated above, the
Aslian branch lies firmly within the Mon-Khmer division, and is not a distinct division
within Austroasiatic (Ruhlen 1986: 89-91). Aslian belongs in a Southern Branch
along with the Monic languages, and possibly also those of the Nicobar islands
(Diffloth p.c).
  The question of internal subgroupings of Aslian is discussed in the following
section.",[38]

        malan     'side'7.5.4 The associative phrase and compounds
A particular lexicalised type of associative phrase is what I will label 'nominal
compounds'. Though phonologically indistinguishable, I distinguish them from
regular phrases because of the syntactic cohesiveness of the constituents as
mentioned in the introduction to §7.5 above.
  Nominal compounds are formed by the syntactic juxtaposition of two nouns, in a
relationship Head-NP. The majority of nominal compounds in Semelai are syntactic
compounds of the associative phrase type.
7.5.4.1 Criteria for distinguishing compounds
It is difficult to find criteria for distinguishing compounds from simple associative
phrase constructions. In a sense, compounds are 'institutionalised' examples of the
associative phrase which, by virtue of being institutionalised, become cohesive
syntactic units.
   As mentioned above, it is difficult to establish any firm phonological criteria for
differentiating compounds from the associative phrase, although perceptually
compounds are less likely to have an intervening pause.
   In the text, compounds are indicated by a point between the lexemes, and are
glossed lexeme by lexeme in the interlinear gloss, but translated as a compound.
   The most important point is that compounds are inaccessible to the rules of
syntax. In an associative construction, individual constituents of the phrase can be
independently modified, see (61) above.
   In the case of compounds which have the semantic relationship of
possessee-possessor, relationship-person, or part-whole (73), the possessor cannot
be marked by the preposition do 'OF'. In (74) the compound does not retain its
meaning, in this case the meaning is nonsensical, as indicated by the question mark.

        nose bone                                  ? log of noseIn contrast, there is no semantic difference between the associative phrase in (75),
and the alternative possessive construction in (76).

the meaning of the compound would not be maintained, see the examples in (62)
above.

phrases where the noun is being negated rather than the verb associated with the

    The coarticulation of a glottal stop with a velar nasal does not occur.
50        2 Phonology and phonotacticsHowever, unlike the aspirated stops, they are highly infrequent and there is a dearth
of minimal pairs. Some examples are:           /?mot/      'to mount*                  /?nom/    'to be ripe
           /?jiih/     'to be ill, in pain'        /?let/    'to extinguish, v.i.*
           /?ris/      'to be alive'               /?ye/     'to see'           celess misals are even less frequent:
           /uph/       'what'
           /ije/       'shortly'
           /fen/       'tiger's voice'   The question arises as to whether these complex segments are in fact a unitary
phoneme, i.e. a single coarticulated segment, or if they constitute a cluster of two
segments. As a unitary phoneme the glottalised sonorant is analysed as a sonorant
consonant, the articulation of which is initiated by glottalic pressure: [7m, 7n, ?ji, V,
7
 1, ? y]. Analysis as a unitary phoneme would liken the glottalised sonorants to
aspirated voiceless stops, differentiated from the corresponding simple phoneme by
manner of articulation.
   Glottalised segments are generally rare in Aslian languages. Some central dialects
of Semai exhibit such stops, e.g. /?nar/ 'two' (Diffloth p.c), but they are extremely
rare even in these dialects. Similar phonemes are attested in other Mon-Khmer
languages, e.g. the iaryngealised glides' of Kammu, a Mon-Khmer language spoken
in Laos (Svantesson 1983), and 'laryngealised' nasals and resonants in Sedang of
Vietnam (Smith 1979). Kammu has a range of potential consonant clusters in the
onset, but this sequence is not considered one. The following minimal pairs are
provided by Svantesson as justification of these as unitary phonemes: /?wiat/
'tired', /wiat/ 'to wilt' and /?yiag/ 'rubber', /yiai)/ 'female'. Unfortunately it is
unclear as to what criteria he has invoked as the basis of the distinction.
   Minimal pairs, or near minimal pairs are once again difficult to locate in Semelai.
Some minimal pairs are /?rey/ 'to be many', /ray/ 'companion', and /njoh/
'what', /moh/ 'to want' and the near minimal pairs: /?ris/ 'to be alive' /res/ 'root',
/?tet/ 'to extinguish' and /lat/ 'dam barrier'. Minimal or near-minimal pairs are yet
to be established for / ? n / , /?ji/ or /IJ/. This does not constitute compelling
evidence for positing a unitary phoneme as opposed to a cluster, however, the
following arguments can be invoked in support of a unitary analysis:     a)    Distribution: The distribution is highly constrained. The sequence only
           occurs in syllable onset position in monosyllabic morphemes, never in the
           onset of any other syllable. In this respect, the glottal clusters are similar to
           aspirated voiceless consonants which also share a restriction to onset
           position, although the latter may occur as a penultimate onset in a few
           lexemes.
     b)    The 'cluster' appears to be invisible to syllabification rules, there is no
           evidence of the presence of an epenthetic vowel, and the consonant sequence
           manifests as a single unit, the nature of the glottal segment lending itself to
           coarticulation with the following consonant. The word containing the cluster
           has only one sonority peak and the whole sequence receives stress, the
                                                           2.3 The distribution of phonemes   51       pattern attested for monosyllabic morphemes. Disyllabic morphemes have an
       unstressed initial syllable.
  c)   Morphological evidence can be found in derivational processes (§3.2.1)
       where allomorphy of the affix is determined by the number of syllables in a
       root. Affixes are selected by calculating the number of syllables in the root:
       monosyllables select prefixes, disyllables select infixes. Roots containing
       globalised sonorants are parsed as monosyllabic, selecting the prefixes
       associated with monosyllabic morphemes. In effect morphological processes
       fail 'to see' the complex initial segment. For example, the causative is formed
       by a prefix par-, or tar- if monosyllabic, or a coda infix <r.> if disyllabic
       (§3.2.3). Roots with a complex onset, pattern with monosyllabic word types
       and select a prefix. Note also the loss of the feature [+glottal] in the
       derivative (§3.2.1.3): ?yot 'to go back' -> tar-yot 'to take sth. back', not
       *?<r>yot.","[77, 78, 79]"

temporal sequence, hne occurs either in conjunction with the aspectual clitic ga=

  hne 'SOON', indicates that the event will happen shortly, in the very near future.
The adverb is glossed in small caps because the speakers were not able to provide a
definition. Speakers generally agreed on a time of around two hours as the
maximum time limit, which in most cases held true. It never co-occurs with ga=
'IMM' in a retrospective context.

The position of hne is fixed, occurring immediately preceding the verbal word

and is itself preceded by pon 'THEREUPON'.

hne, like ga= 'IMM', cannot be used alone, for instance in response to a question, or
to indicate the status of an event.
   In the following examples the function of hne seems more like a marker of
consequence or assertion like pon 'THEREUPON' which is described below. It either
precedes (178) or follows the predicate (179)-(180).

expected sequential relationship amongst verbal actions, 'then, thereupon'. In the

"10.5.1.2 Alternative interrogatives
There are two alternative interrogative particles: kah 'ALT' is used for NPs and beh
'NO' for predicates. The former requires the expression of each constituent, whereas
the latter is elliptical, containing only the affirmative proposition and a tag.i. kah 'ALT' The scope of kah 'ALT' is limited to the constituent it follows, kah
expresses a choice of two or more possible alternatives, and is often used where two
NPs are juxtaposed in an alternative relationship, 'is it A, or is it B?' It is repeated
after each constituent, kah is a borrowing from Malay kah, a general interrogative
post-position or particle (Mintz 1994: 238).(283)    ""kulat.klbeber kah,"" khler)         ""kulat sisir      kah,     n:>?iu>??""

"6.2.7     Distinctions in the ignorative class
Table 6.2 sets out the basic ontological categories and the forms used across the
range of contexts. As demonstrated, for some categories the basic
interrogative-based lexeme is multifunctional,5 and the majority of the range of
ignorative functions are expressed by a single lexical item per category, e.g. h5n
WHERE, i.e. 'where; somewhere' (§6.2.5). For others, different lexical items and
strategies are employed across the range, with the interrogative and generic noun
sharing the functional load. For example, the category of PERSON is expressed in the
following ways: by an interrogative kadeh 'who'; an indefinite pronoun sma?
(person)/ko= (3UA) 'someone'; in negative contexts, by a negative pronoun da? da?
sma? (NEG EXIST person) 'no-one', and by a free choice pronoun bororj-kadeh (any
who) 'whoever', (§6.2.4).
   The categories of PROPERTY and REASON shown in Table 6.2 share the same form,
but are distinguished by differing syntactic contexts (§6.2.2). The ontological
category of MANNER is expressed by a complex ignorative, hon-mande 'in what
manner, how', derived from a compound of the basic terms for PLACE and THING.
The shaded areas in the table indicate the lack of a form for the particular category.",[204]

  A sesquisyllable is a syllable between a monosyllable and a disyllable, i.e. one and a half syllables.
The half syllable consists of a consonant but no vowel, or a consonant and a reduced vowel (Matisoff
1990; Svantesson 1983).
56        2 Phonology and phonotacticsStress Placement The penultimate stress of Malay is replaced by the final syllable
stress of Semelai: the Malay form 'ku.cing 'cat' in Semelai becomes /ku.'ciq/.
Syllable Structure The following adjustments to syllable structure are noted:
a) In Malay vowel initial words are acceptable, in Semelai this is corrected by the
epenthesis of a glottal stop or glottal fricative. Although the forms may have been
borrowed with the glottal onset present, there is also the distinct possibility that this
may be a Semelai innovation in order to offset the inadmissibility of Q[V: 12
            /?ubDt/ 'medicine' = ubat
            /?adi?/ 'YS' = adikThe presence of the / h / is most likely a retention in the regional variety of Malay
from which the forms were borrowed:
            /hayam/ 'chicken' = ayam
            /hubi?/ 'yam' = ubi
            /habu?/ 'hearth' = abu(k)
            /hatap/ 'thatch' = atop
b) Semelai retains intervocalic / h / , no longer present in standard Malay, but present
in some Malay dialects, e.g. Jakun: /tihor)/ 'house pole' = tiang (tihang); /praho?/
'boat' =prau (prahu).
c) Despite the fact that open final syllables V ] o are permitted in Semelai (§2.2.3.1),
in Malay loans the coda is filled by a glottal segment, either / ? / or /h/: /pasuh/
'basin' =pasu9 /hubi?/ 'cassava' = ubi. On the basis of the admissibility in Semelai,
the 'innovation' probably belongs to the source. The choice of phoneme is not
predictable.
d) Intervocalic clusters of homorganic nasal plus voiced stop are reduced to the
nasal, despite this sequence being possible in Semelai. Again, as in the previous
point, this leads to the assumption that these forms have been borrowed in this form:
            /ka.naw/ 'lemur' = kandau
            /tjna.kaw/ 'tobacco' = tembakau
Not all borrowings are subject to reduction, e.g. /lmbu?/ 'bovine' retains the nasal +
stop sequence.
e) The sequence lV.r(V), where the onset of the penultimate syllable is /.I/, and the
onset of the final syllable is /.r/ is not allowed in Semelai, hence the metathesis to
the acceptable sequence rV.l:
            /ru.lus/ 'straight' = lurus
            /ro.li/ 'lorry' = lori
            Zp.ro.lts/ 'Flores Island' = FloresVariations of this type in Malay are recorded in Wilkinson (1927), for example
peruluh vs. standard Malay peluru 'bullet'.
  Metathesis also takes place between adjacent syllables where the offending
segments are located in the onset of the penult and the coda of the final syllable,
12
     Refer for instance to the variant -?i? which is suffixed to a vowel final item (§3.2.1.3).

keluar.
Phonemes The following changes have been observed:
a) Malay words ending in / ? / , orthographic Jfc, are realised as the voiceless velar
stop/k/: /tasek/ iake' = tas/ifc/tase?/.
b) The voiceless labio-dental fricative phoneme /f/ is realised as the voiceless
bilabial stop / p / \ its closest equivalent in Semelai: /pekher7 'to think' = fikir,
/proles/ 'Flores Island' = Flores. It may be that the phoneme is borrowed as / p /
from the local Malay dialect.
   The voiced velar fricative / y / of many non-standard varieties of Malay is realised
as /r/ everywhere: /rban/ 'pen', /crita?/ 'story'.
   Note, for some speakers who have had contact with Malay / y / is a marginal
phoneme, however other speakers who have not had direct contact, perceive it to be
a Semelai phoneme, e.g. the personal name /layi?/ = lari 'flee'.
c) The final vowel, orthographic a, realised as schwa /d/ in Malay, is a non-final
vowel /a/ in Semelai, where it is always followed by a glottal stop: /cina?/
'Chinese' = cina /cina/.
d) There is a change in the quality noted for some vowels. In some instances the
realisation is systematic, in others it is sporadic, e.g. mid-high vowels realised as
high vowels. Change tends only to occur in the final syllable. Again it is assumed
that the words were borrowed in this form. See Collins (1985) for similar patterns in
the Jakun of Kampung Landai, Pahang.
       /a/—>/:>/: /smarpt/     'spirit of life'   = semangat
                  /sunot/      'to circumcise'    = sunat
       /a/—»/e/: /mudeh/       'to be easy'        =mudah
   There is one instance noted where the change applies to both syllables: /renter/
'a creel' = rantang.
English Loanwords Semelai contains lexical items which are English in origin,
e.g. /sigeret/ 'cigarette', but these are more likely to have been acquired as English
loans in Malay: /stek/ 'slingshot' = stek, /roli/ 'lorry' = lori, /bom/ 'bomb' =
bom.
   During the era of the Communist Emergency, Pos Iskandar served as a base for
British troops. Some English loans have been acquired directly from English, e.g.
/resen/ 'rations'. Some of the older men who were boys at the time, claimed to
have formerly spoken English. Two elderly men are known by names derived from
English: /manei)/ 'morning', as a child he would always go around greeting the
soldiers with 'Good Morning', and /pay pay/ 'five five', who is known by his
English approximation of the price of a bottle of drink costing 55c.
   Initial consonant clusters are reanalysed as an open penultimate syllable with the
vowel |>], /s.tatd/ [sa.ta.td] 'starter motor'. Other examples are: /s.ten/ 'Sten
gun', /b.ren/ 'Bren machine gun' and /t.ray/ 'to try, attempt'.
   The phoneme til is replaced by /p/ as in /s.tap nes/ 'staff nurse' and the
pronounciation of 'five' as /pay/.

2.5 Notes on comparative phonology of Aslian languages
The phonemic inventory below is largely adapted from a series of articles by
Benjamin (1985b and 1986) for the Orang Asli Studies Newsletter. It provides the
only comprehensive account of the phonemes of Aslian.","[83, 84, 85, 86]"

  This affix is generally problematic. I suspect that the onset morpheme is the nominalising onset
<.p> and the coda is <n.> (§3.2.2.3). Unfortunately, there are too few examples to draw either
structural or semantic motivations for the two forms. The affix also resembles nominalising pen- a
Malay affix, however the non-concatenative nature of attachment would appear to exclude this
analysis, unless it is a very old borrowing.
7
  One possible explanation for this form is that the prefix is causative <r>, like the disyllabic form,
and the p-/t- defines the type of causation.
8
  This is in contrast to the situation in Temiar where the monosyllabic root has a choice of two
allomorphs, ber-, ter- which are phonologically rather than semantically conditioned. The
conditioning is triggered by the onset of the root: ber- in the environment of an onset / t / or / c / , and
ter- elsewhere. Disyllabic roots have an allomorph <r> (Benjamin 1976b: 169).
                                                                        3.2 Affixation    71Causative Allomorphs The causative prefixes have a number of alternate forms. In
some cases, these are clearly phonologically conditioned; in others the motivating
factor is not readily apparent. The following allomorphs are attested for par- 'CAUS'
and tar- 'MCAUS': for the former pan-, pag-, pa- and p^r-; and for the latter tag-.
Note that the morpheme *ta- is never attested as a light syllable like pa-.
a) The prefix par- is realised as pan- when the onset of the root is / r / : ?ris 'to be
alive' —»pan-ris [pan.dris] 'to raise (s.o.)\ This is the /r/-dissimilation process as
described in §2.1.1.1 and §3.2.1.3.
   It has been attested earlier (§2.2.3.2) that geminate /r/ is not tolerated in Semelai,
and furthermore, there is an absence of words with an /r/ in both the onset and coda
of the monosyllable. In b) below, the allomorph appears to be conditioned not by an
identical coda/onset sequence, but by a sequence of identical codas / r / .
b) This case looks like another instance of /r/ dissimilation although here it is the
coda which triggers the allomorphy. It is not clear why the nasal is realised as a velar
segment rather than alveolar, other than a possible constraint against the onset and
coda of the affix having the same place of articulation in this construction.
   The coda of the causative prefix tar - is realised as a velar nasal stop tag -, where
the coda of the root is /r/: jor 'to urinate' —> tag-jor 'to make (s.o.) urinate'; chor
'to fire (s.th.)' -»tag-c h or 'to make (s.o.) fire (s.th.)'.
   The alternative analysis would be that /g/ is the coda when the onset of the root is a
coronal segment. However motivations on this basis are not attested elsewhere, unlike
/r/ dissimilation.
c) The prefix pag- is only attested as an alternant for par- in the following example:
pag-WDh 'to make (s.th.) upright' <— Vwoh (get up from lying). An alternative form
is pan-WDh.
d) The allomorph pa- also appears to be determined by the coda of the root. The
prefix is realised as pa- where the coda of the root is bilabial /m/, or / p / , or
labio-velar / w / : hum 'to bathe' —> pa-hum 'to bathe (s.o.)'; ?tep 'to be far' —>
pa-lep 'to move (s.th.) apart' and V?aw (standing up) —> pa-?aw 'to stand (s.th.)
up, make upright'. An alternative form for V?aw is /pan-?aw/ 'to stand (s.th.) up'.
  The tar - prefix is insensitive to bilabial codas as shown in the following example:
hop 'to put food in (one's) mouth' —> tar-hr>p 'to put food in (s.o.'s) mouth*.
e) par- is realised as pa- when prefixed to monosyllabic nouns: d:>l 'house' —>
pa-dol 'to house (s.o.)', dak 'water' —> pa-dak 'to wet (s.th.)'.
f) The prefixes par- and tar - are realised as p har -, p har - or t har - when prefixed to a
monosyllabic root with an onset phoneme /?1/ and the coda consonant is a dental or
palatal stop. It is not clear why the onset of the prefix is aspirated. It may be that the
loss of the glottal feature manifests as the feature aspiration in the onset of the prefix:
?ldt 'to go out' -> p^r-let 'to extinguish a flame, turn off, ?luc 'to pass, become
free' -> pher-luc/thar-luc 'to set (o.self) free'/'to free (s.o)'. Note the counter
example where the coda of the root is /m/: ?lem 'to be content' -» pa-lem 'to make
(s.o.) content'.
72     3 Morphology
g) The allomorph tarn- appears to be taken one step further and the coda of the prefix
is conditioned by the onset of the root with which it has assimilated homorganically:
tam-phul 'to place (s.th.) down' <— phul 'to come down'. The problem is that this
assumption requires that the prefix coda is /n/ in order for assimilation to take place,
however the conditioning factors are not found in the data here.
   With the exception of roots with /r/ in the onset, discussed in a) above, it is not
possible to account for the alternant pan-, although it too could be considered a case
of assimilation, recalling that /n/ is the realisation of nasal assimilation with the palatal
series (§2.2.3.1): cin 'cooked' —> pan-cin 'to cook', also par-cin; ca 'to eat' —>
pan-ca 'to feed'.9
3.2.2.2 Underspecified non-syllabic morphemes
Underspecified non-syllabic morphemes are representative of a form of internal
reduplication which has been the focus of studies in prosodic and templatic
morphology (McCarthy 1982, Broselow and McCarthy 1983, Sloan 1988), and in
Optimality Theory (Gafos 1994). There are two non-concatenative processes of
reduplication in Semelai: coda copy and onset copy.
  Copy is a form of reduplication where a phonologically underspecified morpheme
template is prefixed to the final syllable of the root. The phonemic content of the
underspecified morpheme is copied from the prosodic head. Only this portion of the
root is licensed to reduplicate. It is not just the segmental features that are copied, but
also the prosodic identity of the segment: an onset is always copied as an onset, and a
coda is always copied as a coda. Only consonants are copied, never the nucleus. An
empty nucleus slot in the template is filled either by the root vowel of the penultimate
syllable in disyllabic forms, or by the process of epenthesis if the vowel position is
empty (§2.2.3).
  Direction of copying is only ever from right to left, following the direction of
syllabification, from the final syllable into the penultimate syllable position, and never
beyond into the pre-penultimate syllable.
  Coda copy is representative of infixing reduplication,10 where a copy of a segment
of the root is infixed into the root. Coda copy is also attested as part of the template in
nominalisation processes discussed in §3.2.2.3.
  Onset copy is both phonologically and semantically underspecified. In essence, the
morphemic unit resulting from the operation of onset copy is an empty morph, a
formative required to satisfy the template satisfaction condition (§3.2.1.1). In
subsequent nominalisation operations, coda copy also presents in the role of what
appears to be a structurally determined formative, empty of any semantic content
(§3.2.2.3). The lack of phonological specification of coda-copied morphemes is
paralleled by a lack of semantic specification, the function being determined by the
word class of the root to which it is affixed. These are briefly surveyed at the end of
§3.2.3.","[98, 99, 100]"
"10.6.3 The negative imperative
The imperative negator is boy 'NEG:IMP' 'refrain from V (§10.4.3). The form of the
negative imperative clause is dependent on whether the verb is transitive or
intransitive. The intransitive form consists of boy 'NEG.IMP' and the verb
(§10.6.3.1). The transitive imperative is formed by the negative imperative and a
verb bearing the irrealis proclitic ma= 'IRR' (§10.6.3.2), or by a declarative clause
(§10.6.3.3). People on familiar terms use the first form; the second is used where the
addressee is non-familiar (§10.6.3.3).
  The negator is pre-verbal, but may stand alone if the verb is elided (337), but it
usually hosts either =ca? 'IMPI' or =jia *IMP2\ or is followed by na? yandeh 'IMP3':
(336)         toy     na?.yandeh!
         NEGHMP       IMP3
         Don't!
   Urgency can be communicated by lengthening the vowel of the negative
imperative marker as in bo:y (337), or lengthening the vowel and inserting a glottal
stop, b?oy [boloy] (338). The choice is open to the speaker.

1.1 Linguistic type
Semelai exhibits many of the typological characteristics of a mainland Southeast Asian
language, as well as incorporating aspects of Austronesian, notably from sustained
contact with Malay. Whilst there has been considerable impact from Malay,
particularly at the lexical level, Semelai remains a distinctly mainland Austroasiatic
language, but at the same time raises questions with respect to our understanding of
the typology of this region.
A. Phonology Semelai has a rich phonemic inventory. There are thirty-two
consonant phonemes, including a series of voiceless nasals which have not been
recorded previously in an Aslian language; a series of glottalised sonorants, and
twenty vowel phonemes: ten oral vowels and ten phonemically nasal counterparts
(§2.1).
   The maximal canonical syllable is [CV(C)]CT. Phonemic contrasts of both
consonants and vowels are richest in the final syllable; for consonants these contrasts
are maximised in the onset of the final syllable.
   Words have the structure: co —» (crR)n (a) 'a, where: n < 2. Reading from the right,
'a is the final syllable - word stress is always on the final syllable, and there is no
secondary stress, a is the penultimate syllable and aR is the prepenultimate syllable.
The r indicates significantly reduced phonotactic possibilities for both consonants and
vowels, including the characteristic underspecification of vowels associated with this
position. Any oral vowel phoneme has the potential to occur as the phonetic realisation
of an underspecified vowel in a given environment.
   The minimal word is monosyllabic, e.g. /t h i/ 'hand', the maximal word is
tetrasyllabic: /k .r .wan.cerj/ [keruwancerj] 'coral snake sp.'
B. Morphology Semelai is an isolating language with agglutinating features.
Typically for the Aslian family, but at variance with many Mon-Khmer languages,
Semelai has a complex morphological system, containing a rich inventory of prefixes,

Pahang.
2      / Semelaiinfixes, suffixes and a circumfix. Some have their origins firmly in Austroasiatic (e.g.
the nominalising affixes +n+ 2 and <m> (NMZ)), others have been acquired through
language contact with varieties of Malay (e.g. br- (MID) 'middle voice', and t r -
(HAPP) 'happenstance'), see §3.2. Semelai has distinctive word classes (see C below
and §4); the typical function of derivational morphology is to change the word class or
subclass of the root, e.g. from verb to noun or vice versa, from transitive verb to
intransitive verb (§5.3) or mass noun to count noun (§7.6).
   There are two systems of arrangement based on the domain of attachment: a) a non-
concatenative system of prefixes and infixes, which has its origins in Mon-Khmer;
and b) a concatenative system of prefixes, suffixes and a circumfix acquired through
contact with Austronesian, notably Malay. Both systems of attachment are
prosodically driven.
   Affixes may be syllabic, or they may be non-syllabic consonantal units defined in
terms of syllable position, e.g. <r> 'CAUS' is a syllable coda infix r] CT . Syllabic
affixes are fully prespecified, e.g. [ p a r ] o 'CAUS(ative)'.
   Where affixes exhibit allomorphy, this is conditioned primarily by the syllabic
structure of the root and the domain of attachment: monosyllabic roots select heavy
syllable prefixes, whilst disyllabic roots select either infixes or light syllable prefixes,
dependent on the individual affix. These points are illustrated in the following
discussion which focuses on affixes from the non-concatenative system that take the
prosodic head as the domain of attachment.
   The two forms given above for the causative morpheme, t a r - 'MCAUS' and <r>
'CAUS', are licit for monosyllabic and disyllabic roots respectively:    a) Monosyllabic root: hop 'to put food in (one's) mouth'
       Affix t a r - 'MCAUS':
       tar-hop 'to put food in (s.o.'s) mouth'    b) Disyllabic root: jtek [jtek] 'to sleep'
       Infix <r>'CAUS':
       j<r>tek [jertek] 'to cause to sleep'   The most intriguing morphological process is the reduplicative process, which I
term 'Copy'. This is a form of internal reduplication, whereby a phonologically
underspecified morpheme template [CC]^ equivalent to the maximal canonical
syllable, is affixed in penultimate syllable position to the final syllable of the root. The
underspecified segment, which may be a syllable onset or a coda, derives its
phonemic content by copying that of the corresponding segment of the root. The
underspecified vowel slot is filled by epenthesis.
   With monosyllabic roots, the satisfaction of the prefixed template requires full
reduplication of the root:Monosyllabic root: SDC 'to whistle'
 a) Prefix the template [CC]^:
        [CC]JA-SDC2
  Morpheme boundaries of prefixes and suffixes are represented by a hyphen *-', infixes and the
circumfix by parentheses '< >', underspecified affixes are enclosed by '+' and clitic boundaries are
shown by '='.

       into the underspecified positions in the prefix:
       9C-SDC  c)   Given that only consonants may be reduplicated, the underspecified nucleus
       receives phonetic contentfromthe application of vowel realisation rules:
       SC-SDC [sicsDc] 'to be whistling'  With disyllabic roots, the phonemic content of the penultimate syllable of the root is
associated with the template. Coda copy takes place into the underspecified coda
position:
Disyllabic root: caUk 'to detach'
  Coda copy:
  a) Prefix the template [C]^ to the prosodic head and associate the phonemic
       content of the root:  b)   Copy the phonemic content of the root coda into the underspecified coda
       position C:
       ca<k>Uk 'to be detaching'
  Coda copy may co-occur with the affixation of a partially prespecified affix like
nominalising onset n- which has a morphemic template [nC]^:
Monosyllabic root: soc 'to whistle'
 a) Prefix the template [nC]^ and associate the phonemic content of the root:
     [nCJfi-SDC ->nC-soc
 b) Coda copy reduplicates the phonemic consonantal content of the root into the
     underspecified position in the prefix:
       nc-soc
  c)   The underspecified nucleus receives phonetic content from the application of
       vowel realisation rules:
       nc-soc [nicsDc] 'act of whistling'
  Borrowed Malay lexemes are fully incorporated into the Semelai system. There are
no restrictions on the combinatorial possibilities of indigenous and borrowed terms.
  a)   Coda copy
       Prefixation of the template [CC]^ to the prosodic head of verbal root tujiuk 'to
       point out, indicate' (< Malay tunjuk) derives:
       tu<k>jiuk 'to be pointing'
  b)   Nominalisation:
       Infixation of the nominalisation template [nC]^ into the root sudu? 'spoon' (<
       Malay sudu) derives a measure noun:
       s<n>u<?>du? [sanu?du?] 'spoonful'
   Roots can feed multiple affixation, combining affixes from both systems of
attachment. In the following example, taking the verb kjiep 'to blink', the causative
infix, <r> 'CAUS', is a morpheme of the non-concatenative type, and the prefixed
happenstance morpheme, t- 'HAPP', is from the concatenative type:
4         1 Semelai     a)    Infixation of <r> 'CAUS':
           k<r>jiep (blink<CAUS>) [kerjiep] 'to make blink'     b)    Prefixation of t - 'HAPP':
           t-k<r>jiep (HAPP-blink<CAUS>) [Ukarjiep] 'to happen to make blink'C Word classes       Semelai has clearly distinguished word classes, both syntactically
and morphologically. The open classes are nominal, verb and expressive.
   The nominal superclass includes nouns, as well as the following closed classes:
numerals, pronouns, demonstratives and ignoratives. Nominals function as the heads
of NPs, predicates in non-verbal clauses and nominal modifiers in associative
constructions.
   Verbs function as predicates. The majority of verbs are clearly transitive or
intransitive; there is also a small number of ambitransitive verbs. The distinction
between stative and active verbs cuts across the transitive/intransitive division.
Intransitive verbs also distinguish an adjective class.
   Expressives 3 are iconic utterances, which function to simultaneously provide
information about both the predicate and its arguments, in the form of a single lexical
item. They function as clausal adjuncts, or stand alone as minor clauses.
   Members of this class express sensate imagery - aural, visual, oral, tactile - e.g.
torjboc 'short and fat (of people)'. Expressives frequently combine a cluster of
properties, e.g. the lexical item br?ol '(s.th.) large, dark and motionless lying
submerged in the water' combines dimension, colour and position. In addition, they
exhibit irregular phonology, irregular reduplication patterns and vowel alternation.
   The closed classes are preposition, adverb, auxiliary, existential and ascriptive
predicators, negator, connective and interjection (§4).
   Lexemes must undergo derivational procedures, either morphological or syntactic,
in order to function in a different word class.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"
