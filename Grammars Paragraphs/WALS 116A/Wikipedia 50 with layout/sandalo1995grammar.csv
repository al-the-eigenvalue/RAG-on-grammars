             Kadiwéu      has two types of interrogative      constructions.       Complements       are questioned by means   of the       incorporation of the interrogative ame in a locative/existential predicate:

"            COMP] (232). Complements can be questioned by incorporating the interrogative ame in a locative verb            (233-234). The absence of wx-complements in [SPEC, COMP] provides important support for the claim that            only pronominal clitics and affixes are arguments in Kadiwéu.

               Saito 1985 and Speas 1991 have pointed out that the proposal that nominals are adjuncts. i.e. that they            are not properly governed by the verb, predicts that multiple questions (e.g. where did vou see what?)            should be ungrammatical, since it would leave behind two adjunct traces. If neither of the nominals is            properly governed by the verb, then both would have to be antecedent-governed in order to satisfy the            ECP. This prediction also holds, since only one nominal phrase can be questioned in a Kadiwéu clause: !",[101]
"            Example 299 and 301 show bivalent verbs and 300 and 302 show derived unergative verbs.            (299)        jilaji.

              Deverbal nouns offer further support. In order to derive avalent deverbal nouns, it is necessary to delete           all the valency features. To derive an avalent noun from a bivalent verb, both cause       and become    must           be deleted. Observe in 303 that the verb and the noun contain the same root. The suffixes -kan ""[-become]'           and -Gegi '[-cause]' must be added to the bivalent root -g:i 'ask/answer' in order to derive an avalent noun:           (303 )        jig:idi                                  lig:ikanGegi.

                Derived bivalent verbs can also be tured        into avalent nouns. For instance. the unaccusative verb -           Gol:a ‘blind’ can be turned into a bivalent verb by adding -Gad (304). The derived bivalent verb can then           be turned into an avalent noun by attaching both -kan and -Gegi (305). Note that -Gad remains in the           derived form.

              To sum up. I argued that the suffixes in Table 14 operate on LCS adding or deleting the primitive           predicates cause and become and. consequently. introducing or deleting semantic arguments. Cause           and become are part of a LCS of a verb and can be added to a noun via valency suffixes.","[127, 128]"
"                   Questions regarding categorical distinctions have occupied a central place in linguistics. Chomsky           (1986b and later works)           makes     a distinction between      lexical categories. which are defined over the           features [+/-noun, +/-verb], and functional categories, which include the following grammatical elements:           complementizer, determiner, tense, and light verbs. According to Chomsky, cross-linguistic differences           are not random. but they are confined to a specific component of grammar. The parametric variation           across languages lies in inflectional categories rather than in lexical categories. Therefore, the proposal           that Salishan languages lack a lexical contrast between nouns and verbs is incompatible with Chomsky's           proposal.",[118]

               I asked who said that the car hit Joseph and who said that John washed the dishes. Fifty speakers of           Kadiwéu. including adults and children over six years old, were tested. Some speakers answered that the           subject of -me:n 'say' could be either of the participants of the stories. but the Majority answered Joseph           and John respectively. Some children answered Pau! and John’s mother respectively: these children's first           language was Portuguese, however, and they learned Portuguese outside the village. Children who learned           Portuguese in the village answered Joseph and Joao, respectively, even when the test was applied in           Portuguese, that is. when the stories and questions were conducted in Portuguese.

"               Parameters place limits on the ways in which languages may differ, thereby reducing the number of           grammatical hypotheses a child might consider in the course of language acquisition. Thus. the hypothesis           developed in this chapter has implications for language acquisition. According to Radford (1990:199).           ""the earliest grammars developed by young children are purely lexical in nature"". That is, according to           Radford. child language is purely a projection of lexical categories. If this is true. we might expect           children to first assume that there are no pronominal argument languages. A question for further research           concerns the extent to which the grammatical development of children acquiring Kadiwéu is parallel to           that of children acquiring (for instance) European languages.",[137]

I assume the view of cross-linguistic variation proposed           in the Principles & Parameters         theory (Chomsky     1981   and   later works).   According   to Chomsky           (1987:68),               "" The initial state of the language faculty consists of a collection of subsystems. or modules as they are
           called, each of which is based on certain very general principles. Each of these principles admits of a
           certain very limited possibility of variation. We may think of the system as a complex network. associated
           with a switch box that contains a finite number of switches. The network is invariant, but each switch can
           be set in one of two positions. on and off. Unless the switches are set. nothing happens. But when the
           switches are set in one of the permissible ways, the system functions, yielding the entire infinite array of
           interpretation for linguistic expressions. A slight change in switch settings can yield complex and varied
           phenomenal consequences as its effects filter through the network.""","[132, 133]"

                In more recent work Chomsky’s uniform bar-level hypothesis. according to which the number of bars            for maximal projection is uniform across categories, has been questioned. For instance. Fukui & Speas            (1986) argue that functional categories are limited to a single specifier position and a single complement            position. By contrast, lexical categories project recursively as long as they have theta-roles to assign. In            other words. the projection of lexical categories has been assumed to correlate with their capacity to assign            theta-roles. Now, there are several pieces of evidence that verbs cannot assign theta-roles in Kadiwéu. If            the projection of lexical categories is indeed tied to their ability to assign theta-roles, that entails that            Kadiwéu verbs do not project.","[133, 134]"

One possible answer            that can be found within Government & Binding theory is that case licenses the presence of grammatical            arguments. Thus, the function of those morphemes could be assignment of structural case. But Kadiwéu            presents evidence against this interpretation.     A morpheme such as -d: can occur with a subject pronoun            (nominative) in unaccusative clauses (310) or object pronoun (accusative) in transitive clauses (311). All            subjects (i.e. subjects of transitive clauses (which only appear if the object is third-person). unergative            subjects, unaccusative subjects. and subjects of passives and reflexives) are in the nominative case in            Kadiwéu. Objects are marked by a different set of pronominals.            If we were dealing with case, I would            expect pronominals co-occurring with -d: to belong to a same structural class (i.e. nominative. accusative.            or ergative). This is not the case —        there is one form that indicates      that the pronominal   is in the            nominative case and another that indicates accusative case and -d: co-occurs with both. The morpheme -            d: indicates the semantic role of a pronominal. theme. not its case. This fact indicates to me that the            transitivity morphemes         are operating on theta   role assignment     --   hence   the label semantic   role            morphemes.

"            Jelinek claims that the Theta-Criterion applies verb-internally in pronominal argument languages. The fact that        pronominal clitics and affixes, rather than nouns, co-occur with semantic role markers in Kadiwéu suggests that        the Theta-Criterion must indeed be applied verb-internally in some languages.                  One could question whether the        semantic role markers are attached to pronominals at the phonological level. If this were the case, Baker's        approach still could be maintained.          If the argument phrases are an empty pro. the logical possibility is to cliticize        them to the verb at the phonological level. There is, however, evidence suggesting that the phenomenon is truly        morphological. Table 5 (repeated here as Table 11 for convenience), a schematic representation of Kadiwéu verb        structure,     shows     that the pronominal-semantic       role assigner clusters occur        deeply   embedded       in the verb        morphology.       Pronominal clitics and affixes are further inside the verb structure than inflectional morphemes such       as aspect, mood, directionals, and plural markers. The pluralizer -waji has different semantic scope according to       the verbal valency: it pluralizes the subject prefix if the clause is intransitive (202), but it pluralizes an internal       argument if the verb has one (203). The fact that -wayi accesses the internal morphological boundaries of the verbal       stem to establish its semantic scope indicates that this morpheme cannot be attached to the verb at the phonological       level.   A morpheme which is attached to the verb at the phonological level (simple clitic) cannot access the lexical       properties of its host. The fact that Kadiwéu semantic role morphemes are inside -waji in the verb structure       indicates that those morphemes also cannot attach to the verb at the level of phonological form.

              4.2.2. Syntactic Tests. In this section I show. by means of a variety of syntactic tests. that all the            available evidence indicates that Kadiwéu is indeed a pronominal argument language.","[90, 91, 92]"
"        Noble Kadiwéu is a pitch-accent language —- that is, contrast in pitch variation. rather than loudness. is involved        (H stands for high tone and L for low tone). The metrical domain includes the stem only (i.e. the root and        derivational morphology):           inflectional morphology falls outside the metrical domain.       (38)         a. Foot Construction:                    Parse words into syllabic trochees from right to left.
                     b. Word Layer Construction:          End rule left.",[41]
               One of the dichotomies drawn in studies of prominence is that between pitch-accent languages and stress-        accent languages (Trubetzkoy 1939).              Some phoneticians maintain that there is a distinction to be made between        linguistic contrasts involving loudness and those involving pitch. In pitch-accent languages a prominent syllable        bears a high tone; in stress-accent languages a prominent                syllable is pronounced with a greater amount of energy.,[41]
"               Control structures and SVCs differ significantly in a fourth way. Control structures allow independent            negation. as any biclausal structure does (271). SVCs by contrast, function as monoclausal structures in            that they do not allow independent negation (272). Only the first verb can be modified by a negative            morpheme. as in 273, and that morpheme implies the negation of the whole string.",[114]

             The metrical template in Noble Kadiweéu creates binary feet over syllables. However. an exclusive parsing into       binary feet is impossible in stems containing an odd number of syllables: in such a stem. a syllable would be left       over. A foot formed by a single syllable is called a degenerate foot. According to Hayes 1995, there are two types of       languages concerning degenarate feet: (i) those which severely ban degenerate feet, and (ii) those which tolerate       degenerate feet. I argue that Noble Kadiwéu. unlike Non-noble Kadiwéu. bans degenerate feet.","[41, 42]"
"                *   An alternative hypothesis is to say that the reconstruction proposed by Ceria & Sandalo reflects Non-                noble Proto-Waikurian.    rather than Proto-Waikurian.    According to this hypothesis, Noble Kadiwéu               descends from Noble Proto-Waikurian and maintains iy and wl.           The Proto-Waikurian sequences *iy               and *wl’ were reanalyzed as *y: and        *w:   in Non-noble   Proto-Waikurian.   On this hypothesis,   the               languages from the Southern branch and Non-noble Kadiwéu derive from the same Proto-dialect, Non-            noble Proto-Waikurian.        Non-noble Proto-Waikuriian gave rise to two branches. In one branch long            semivowels       were maintained, and in the other branch long semivowels          were   reinterpreted as true            consonants. A problem would be to explain why Non-noble Kadiwéu is much more similar to Noble            Kadiweu than to its sister languages. Although these differences could be accounted for by the claim that            Non-noble Kadiwéu is spoken by warriors, serfs, and slaves who are still in contact with their lords. while            the languages of the Southern branch could be assumed to be spoken by warriors and slaves who have            been isolated from their Waikurian masters as well as from Non-noble Kadiwéu for centuries. I avoid            proposing such an explanation since this claim has no sociolinguistic support.",[141]
               Vowel-cluster reduction rules apply whenever a prefix ending in a vowel is added to a stem beginning with a       vowel. The following vowel reductions were observed:          (a) A non-high vowel is deleted before another non-high vowel.,[30]

            Griffiths says that the constituent order of subordinate clauses is always VSO. but I have found alternative       constituent orders in subordinate clauses as well. In 146 and 147 the subject of the subordinate clause precedes the       verb, while in 148 the object precedes the verb:       (146)      jowo:GotaGa                               me           el:yodi        oqo         oyowo:Godi

             3.2.3. Diminutive. Kadiwéu has two diminutive suffixes that encode gender: -nig:i ‘masculine diminutive’       and -na ‘feminine diminutive’. The diminutive suffixes are very productive in that they can co-occur with any       nominal root. Voiced short obstruents are devoiced before a diminutive suffix:

            3.2.4. Number. Kadiwéu has five plural suffixes -(a)di, -pi, -Ga. -dodi, and -al:i. The suffix -a/:i is a plural       suffix used exclusively with nouns that refer to objects that have an elongated form (nod:a:jol-:i ‘knifes'). The       choice among ail the other plural suffixes seem to be lexically determined. The suffixes -adi and -al:i are realized       as -di and -/:i . respectively. when they attach to a stem ending in a vowel.

The suffix -jegi ‘source’ is used to derive nouns from        other nouns. The suffix -jegi causes the devoicing of the last voiced stop of a root (nigotaGa 'city', nigotaqajegi        ‘citizen’). Kadiwéu has a suffix -awa ‘like’ which is used to derive nouns from nouns that contain a diminutive        suffix. Some of these constructions involve reduplication of the last phonological foot (recall that fect are formed       from right to left in Kadiwéu):       (134)         nig:anig:awa:nigi

           spokenby about 1,500 Indians distributed over
                                                      an area of 538,000 hectares in the State of Mato Grosso do
           Sul, Brazil. The Kadiwéus are the only surviving descendants of the Mbayd people, who
                                                                                               in the 18th.
           century dominated a large extension of the Brazilian and Paraguayan Chaco area. The data for this study
           is comprised primarily of material collected in fieldwork with native speakers of Kadiwéu in Serra da
           Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
               I provide a detailed description of Kadiwéu phonology and morphology. | offer a description of the
           Kadiwéu phonology, on synchronic and diachronic grounds, taking dialect differences into consideration.
           Kadiwéu      has two dialects which reflect gender and social status. Moreover,                 I provide a detailed
           description of the verb and noun morphology. The verb is marked for subject and object in person and
           number.     Kadiwéu    marks subject person with          prefixes, but number (pl)      is marked     with a suffix
           immediately following
                            the root. Aspect
                                         and mood, but not tense, are markedon the verb. There are seven
           aspect markers - completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive, and intensive - and two mood
           markers, conditional and desiderative.          There are also three negation markers and a set of directional
           enclitics. Among      the WaikurGan languages, only Kadiwéu has a set of semantic role markers. The
           structure of the Kadiwéu noun resembles noun structure in other Waikunian languages as well as in most
           westem      South   American   languages.       The   presence   of classifiers/nominalizers    marking   inalienable
           possession seems to be an areal feature of the languages of western lowland South America.
               Several aspects of the Kadiwés syntax, which bear on theoretical issues, are discussed. Kadiwéu has
           the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted, nominal
           phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb,              and some discontinuous nominal
           expressions
                 are allowed.             Jelinek   1984    explains the properties of nonconfigurational
                                                                                                  languages by
          proposing that languages set the elements which can be verbal arguments.                        According to Jelinek,
           pronominal clitics and affixes are the arguments in nonconfigurational languages;
                                                                                      nominal phrases are
           adjuncts and therefore they can assume free order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally
           accepted, however. For instance, Baker 1994 argues that nominat phrases are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he
           denies that pronominals are arguments in this language. According to Baker, the arguments are an empty
           category pro that occupies the projections of the verb. Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting Jelinek’'s

            hypothesis that pronominals can indeed be arguments in some languages. First, pronominal clitics and
            affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly tike English prepositions in that they assign semantic
            roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ‘benefactive’, -g ‘goal’, -/okom '‘adessive', -k '‘allative’.
            Nouns can never co-occur with such semantic role assigners. The fact that bound pronominals, rather than
            nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal argument language
            of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests support the
            analysis —    passivization,   recursivity, coreference,   anaphora,   quantifiers, and the behavior     of wu-
            interrogatives ~- support the analysis.
                This dissertation also shows that the major lexical categories present in Kadiwéu are nouns and verbs.
            Kadiwéu lacks prepositions entirely. I show that structures previously analyzed as containing prepositional
            phrases are in fact serial verb constructions.
                 Finally, I present the criteria I used to classify the Kadiwéu roots as nouns or verbs. Verbs are those
            elements which are valent; that is, that have an argument structure. Valency representation contains
            information about the number of arguments a verb requires
                                                                and the semantic nature
                                                                                    of those arguments. I
           determine the valency of a Kadiwéu root according to (i) the meaning of a bare root and (ii) the meaning
            of a stem consisting of the reot plus a valency suffix. Although Kadiwéu has valent roots, it has no
            transitive roots.   I understand transitivity as the capacity of assigning theta-roles to complements.
            Transitivity is assigned syntactically via verb movement. This dissertation has implications for language
           typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers’ 1994 prediction that transitivity is assigned at the
            syntactic level in all languages whose arguments are pronominals, rather than nominal phrases or an
            empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. | propose a parametric variation based on an insight in Fukui &
            Speas 1986 to account for pronominal argument languages. I argue that in these languages verbs do not
            project. On this hypothesis, clauses in pronominal argument languages are formed by raising of a valent
            lexical item to adjoin a light verb, which is a functional category able to theta-assign.","[4, 5, 6, 7]"
"             Bresnan & Mchombo (1987) discuss the fact that Chichewa has an optional object marker on the verb. and       when the object marker occurs, word order is free, while word order is rigid when the object marker is absent. On       the basis of these facts, they claim that the object marker and nominal phrases share argument properties. Thus.      when the object markers appears, the overt nominal associated with it is not in argument position and hence is not      subject to ordering conditions. In contrast, when the object marker is not present. the nominal phrase is an      argument and therefore follows a rigid order. Their analysis cannot be extended to Kadiwéu, however. because

"       There is only one form for the plural demonstrative, id:iwa. The plural marker -wa can also be used to mean       ‘Kadiwéu nationality’ or ‘pertaining to the Kadiwéus' (e.g. ad:iwa iwal:o ‘that Kadiwéu woman sitting’ vs. ad:i       iwal:o ‘that woman sitting’). Absence is always marked by the morpheme                    *k:a; when the object or person is       present,   however,      the form   varies   according   to position   (static/moving).

"            >>    Note. however. that transitivizing suffixes are not present when the object is third person. It seems that            constructions whose object is understood as third person are in fact like such English sentences as John            ate. that is, semantically there are two arguments (we know that John ate some food). but syntactically the            construction is intransitive.            *¢          assume that pronominals are elements of a non-projecting D(eterminer) category: that is. a
            functional category that bears person and number features. The claim that D does not project is supported            by    the     fact   that   quantifiers   appear   incorporated   to   locative   predicates   in   Kadiwéu.    Moreover.           demonstratives are likely to be verbs and there is no articles. Kadiwéu is not the only nonconfigurational           language to lack determiner projections.

"               A severe ban on degenerate feet makes predictions about possible word shapes. If a quantity-insensitive       language allow no degenerate feet at all. then there can be no monosyllables in this language.            Therefore.       monosyllables are predicted to be non-existent in Noble Kadiwéu, which is quantity-insensitive. This is indeed the       case: monosyllabic words must be expanded into disyllables, as represented in 42.       (42)                    a
              Observe in 42 that the vowel is not merely lengthened: instead it is reduplicated into a new syllable. The       syllabic trochee languages which ban degenerate feet studied by Hayes allow no words consisting of a single light       syllable; however,   they do allow monosyllabic words consisting of a heavy syllable. Hayes thus proposes that       syllabic-trochee languages characteristically employ a minimal-word constraint which takes heavy syllables as       proper feet. Kadiwéu conterexemplifies Hayes’ generalization, since all stems containing an odd number of       syllables, even those which contain a long vowel, must be expanded in order to be well-formed. The wave forms in       Figure 2 illustrates the analysis with the monosyllables ve: ‘he died' and ye 'my belly’. which show the same       reduplication pattern. Each peak in the wave represents one independent vowel. Long vowels appear as long peaks.",[42]

"               In telic events the activity has a clear terminal point. while atelic events have no natural end point. In       languages like English, aspectual properties such as telic and atelic are lexicalized with the verbal roots. There is       nothing in the morphology of English which indicates, for instance, that the event described in fall is telic while       the event described in see is atelic. In Kadiwéu such aspectual properties are marked by suffixes that immediately       follow the verbal root. The verb has a telic reading if the suffix -g is present (64), but an atelic reading if it is not

           Auxiliary verbs must also be inflected for person and number. They have. however, a different inflectional       pattern. Example 100 illustrates the inflectional pattern of auxiliary verbs. Observe that auxiliary verb inflection       involves suppletion.      ( 100 )     -go = ‘go’

Another set of derivational        enclitics, which must precede the directional clitics. can be used to create motion verbs. [ classify these morphemes        as derivational because they can change the meaning of the verbal stem (note the meaning shift in 108). Like any        other enclitic in Kadiwéu, they trigger deletion of sonorant consonants.

The last parsed foot is        expanded if this is a prospective degenerate foot:        (45)                                     |

            Exampies            45 and 46 show that words containing light and heavy syllables are treated identically. Because        Noble Kadiwéu is quantity-insensitive. light and heavy syllables are parsed identically. The wave forms in Figure 3        confirm the analysis.","[43, 44]"

                   Grimshaw proposes that verbs in English have an a-structure and are theta-markers.          Eventive           nominals in English have an a-structure as well, but they cannot assign theta-role. Therefore. in order to           have grammatical arguments, eventive nouns need a theta-assigner. Thus, eventive nouns appear with a           preposition in English (e.g. donation of money to hospitals) and with a light verb in some constructions of           Japanese. My proposal is that Kadiwéu does not have any lexical category that is able to theta-assign. The          elements that [ classify as verbs in Kadiwéu        are similar to eventive nominals of of better known          languages: they are valent (i.e. have an argument structure in Grimshaw's terminology) but they are not

"              4.4.1. Valency. The term valency is derived from chemistry and is often used in linguistics to refer          to the number and type of bonds which the verb may form with a number of dependent elements referred          to as arguments (Crystal     1985). This definition, however, is ambiguous, because transitivity can be          defined in the same way. In this work, I use valency to refer exclusively to the syntactically relevant          components of meaning specified in the Lexicon of a language.",[119]

            5. Conclusion
                  In this dissertation I have provided a grammar of a little-known language of the Waikuruan family.","[137, 138]"
"           '0     In active systems the agent argument of a transitive verb is marked like the sole argument of an           unergative verb. which is also an agent semantically. Nonagent arguments (and also possessives) are           marked by a different set of prefixes. In this system agent arguments form a natural class, distinct from           nonagents.       Vestiges of an active system are found in all the Waikurian         languages. and has been           reconstructed for Proto-Waikurdan (Ceria & Sandalo       1995). Although Kadiwéu       marks   Isg, Ipl, 2sp/pl.           and 3sg      subjects of unergative and unaccusative verbs by the same set of    of prefixes. there are some           unaccusative verbs that must be marked by an object prefix instead of a subject prefix (see dictionary):           (i)    God:awela
                  Go-d:-awela

"             The most salient differences between Noble and Non-noble Kadiwéu are at the level of suprasegmental        phonology. Noble Kadiweéu shows a pitch-accent system which parses the word into binary trochees: degenerate        feet are repaired into binary feet through reduplication. Noble Kadiwéu is quantity-insensitive. and therefore any        monosyllable is expanded into a disyllable. Non-noble Kadiwéu not only tolerates degenerate feet but also has a        different stress system. Non-noble Kadiwéu is a stress-accent language which parses the word into iterative ternary        feet. Moreover. Non-noble Kadiweéu is quantity-sensitive. Comparison of the Kadiwéu prosody with the prosody of        the other Waikurian    languages   suggests that Non-noble    Kadiwéu   stress patterns were   introduced   through        interference from Portuguese and/or Spanish. See Appendix 1 for further examples of comparative Waikurian       vocabulary (with reconstructions), and Appendix 2 for a comparison of Noble and Non-noble Kadiweéu lexicon.",[49]
