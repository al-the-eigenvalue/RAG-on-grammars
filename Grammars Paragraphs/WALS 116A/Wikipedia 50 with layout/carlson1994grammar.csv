14.2.1.2. Bias in yes/no questionsQuite often, perhaps usually, a speaker expects one response rather than the
other to a yes/no question. Sometimes this bias does not seem to overtly af-
fect the form of the question. Thus la and bi questions are apparently neutral
in form, although in context either an affirmative or a negative answer may
be anticipated. Ti and tähä questions, on the other hand, are always heavily
biased. It is not possible to say exactly what the bias is from the form of the
question. Both positive and negative questions may have both positive and
negative bias. All that the use of tiltähä seems to contribute is the informa-
tion that bias is present. Positive bias (i.e. expectation of a 'yes' answer, in-
dicating the hearer believes in the truth of the positive proposition, or the
truth of the positive proposition corresponding to the negative one) is more
common than negative bias. All four examples of tiltähä questions in the
previous section (23) and (25) have positive bias. However, both positive
and negative questions can also have negative bias, as the following exam-
ples show:  (26) positive question, negative bias

        Β:        ηihm
              no
              'No.'

         'Is monkey not well?' 8  In contrast to negative tä! tähä questions, negative mä/ä questions are rou-
tinely biased to a positive response. The two examples in (24) in the previ-
ous section both expect consent to the truth of the corresponding affirmative
declarative. This is the most common pattern with negative yes/no questions
cross-linguistically (see Givön 1990, chapter 18).","[552, 553]"

14.2. Questions
Questions in Supyire, like those in most languages (cf. Sadock and Zwicky
1985: 178), can be broadly classified into two major types: yes/no questions
and constituent questions (Sadock and Zwicky call them ""information"" ques-
tions). The two types are distinguished in Supyire by the different interroga-
tive particles they require, and by the presence of question words in constitu-
ent questions versus their absence in yes/no questions. These two major
types of question are dealt with in the first two principal subsections of this
section.
  In addition to the major question types, there are a couple of minor types.
Alternative questions (see section 14.2.1.4) are similar to yes/no questions,
and are historically related to them. The 'What about ...' question type (see
section 14.2.4) is more like a constituent question in function, but lacks a
question word. Two further subsections deal with subjects related to ques-
tions: complex questions (section 14.2.3), and non-interrogative uses of
questions (section 14.2.5).
                                                              14.2. Questions   527
14.2.1. Yes/no    questionsYes/no questions are those which solicit a comment on the truth of the ques-
tioned proposition (cf. Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 179). The question is not
always ""open"", however, since the speaker typically expects one answer
more than the other (Givön 1990, chapter 18). Nor is the question equally
about all the information in the proposition. Instead the scope of the interro-
gation typically falls on what would be the focus of assertion in the corre-
sponding declarative. These issues are dealt with in separate subsections of
the present section, after an initial description of the form of yes/no ques-
tions. A fourth section describes the alternative question subtype.","[549, 550]"
"Indirect yes/no questions are interesting in that, at least for some speakers,
they preserve the older, alternative form of the question marker (läa ' o r ' ) in-
stead of using the shortened form employed in direct yes/no questions (/a).",[477]
"
11.5.3. Question      complementsA few verbs of speech and cognition can take /^complements in the form of
questions. The most common of these is the verb yi1)6 'ask', which has a
variant pronunciation yig6. The full range of possibilities occurs with this
verb in the corpus, and so it will provide a useful means to illustrate the
various complement types. Other verbs will be briefly described at the end
of the section.
                                       11.5. Verbs of speech and cognition   453   Yib6 allows and indeed seems to favor complements in the direct quotation
style. Following are examples of yes/no, alternative, and constituent ques-
tions directly quoted. Note that the dative-addressee is coded as the direct
object, and that it is obligatorily mentioned. (68) a. yes/no question
           Kä u ύ         wüü yig6
           and he NARR us ask
           'Then he asked us,

           ""Have you bought (lit. taken) tickets yet?""'
        b. alternative question

           and baobab.DEF inside people.DEF NARR hyena             ask
           'Then the people on the inside of the baobab tree asked Hyena
           "" Ciß-jydebii       ύ    lwoh6        e mu si        m-byä
            women-old.DEF GEN water.DEF in you FUT FP-drink
           ""Is it from the old women's water that you will drink
           läa pücyaabff wiig6          e?""
           or girls.DEF POSS.DEF in
           or from that of the girls?""'
        c. constituent question
           Kä pi /          ύ ' yib6, ""Nteencw0,
           and they NARR her ask       Nteencwo,
           'Then they asked her, ""Nteencwo,
          jd   u    ä    mu jyiile yeV'
           who s/he PERF you cross Q
           who took you across?'""  Just as with declarative /»-complements, most indirect question comple-
ments are in every respect (apart from intonation) like independent questions
except that they are reworked to reflect the deictic center of the main clause.
The following examples illustrate indirect alternative and constituent ques-
tions:
454   Chapter 11: Complement clauses  (69) a. indirect alternative question
           Kä u    ύ       ίή-ρά  ml) yfl>6,

           or go give the food.'
        b. indirect constituent question
           Kä m)) /         ύ ' yfg6 jd     yy6r6 u     mä ye.

           'And I asked her whose place she was going to.'","[475, 476, 477]"
"  The other major clause final negative marker, mä, is used principally in
questions. The initial [m] frequently elides if the metrical conditions are
right, but this is not obligatory. For yes/no questions, the ordinary question
marker la is simply replaced by mä, and the result is a negative yes/no ques-
tion. Such negative questions are almost always rhetorical in force, and are
strongly biased towards a positive response, just as negative questions are in
English:  (151)   a. Mu fly ε ä        ma    shyiri-foö jiyi mä?
             you NEG PERF your witness-owner see NEG.Q
             'Didn't you see your buddy?'
378   Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negation          b. Lire         jiye   a     tdrä änä ä?
             this(EMPH) NEG PERF pass there NEG.Q
             'Didn't this pass there?'","[400, 401]"
"  The conjunction läa is probably the etymological source of the yes/no in-
terrogative particle la. Yes/no questions were evidently originally truncated
alternative questions with the second disjunct missing.",[555]
"
15.2.3.     DisjunctionIn comparison with contrast, coordinate clauses with the relation of disjunc-
tion ('or') are only infrequently used in the corpus. There are two distinct
ways of coding disjunction, neither of which has a very general use. The
first was mentioned in chapter 14, in the section on alternative questions
(14.2.1.4). It was pointed out there that when it is used to conjoin clauses,
the ""disjunction"" läa 'or' normally creates a question (moreover läa is the
probable source of the yes/no question marker la), though in its use as a
noun phrase conjunction this is not true (see chapter 6, section 6.7.2). Fol-
lowing are examples of this type of alternative question: (111)       a. U a         kärd läa u       na     ßye bag6 e?
                she PERF go        or she PROG be house.DEF in
                'Has she gone or is she in the house?'
             b. Mu gii    rä a       bäär6
                you POT go PROG work.IMPFV
                'Are you going to work
                läa mu gii     rä a        bärä  yuü?
                or you POT go PROG conversation take.IMPFV
                or are you going to talk?'",[619]
"
14.2.2. Constituent questionsConstituent (""information"", ""wh"") questions are different from yes/no ques-
tions in both form and function. Speakers typically use constituent questions
when they wish to know one bit of information which is missing in an oth-
                                                           14.2. Questions   533
erwise known proposition (cf. Giv<Sn 1990, chapter 18). The bit of desired
information is coded with a question word, for which there is no equivalent
in a yes/no question.
  The basic structure of constituent questions is described in the following
subsection. Subsequent sections give specific information about the various
types of question, classified according to the question word employed.","[555, 556]"
"
5.11. Inteijections
Like any language, Supyire has a large, heterogenous class of interjections.
Only a few will be mentioned here. Agreement is shown with odn or aän or
mm 'yes', disagreement with 6nho or mhm ' n o ' . The agreement interjections
are regularly used by a listening interlocutor to indicate that the discourse is
being monitored. This role is extremely important even when the discourse is
a monologue, such as a folk tale, and is known as οοηηίshwo 'to answer the
yes*.
  Surprise or disbelief is indicated by a variety of interjections: 6, 6), haan,
0he, päpapä. More elaborate exclamations are greatly favored by some:
bismilahi 'in the name of God' (from Arabic), pätfsägkänä '(exclamation of
surprise or embarrassment)' (from Bambara).
  An extremely common interjection is pyi, which can mean a variety of dif-
ferent things, including 'well', 'all right', 'and so'. It is exactly equivalent in
function to Bambara ayiwa.

                                 Chapter 6
                               Noun phrases
In Supyire noun phrases some modifying elements precede and some follow
the head noun. In very general terms (there are exceptions), those elements
which precede the head indicate a definite reference, while those elements
which follow the head are either descriptive or else indicate indefinite refer-
ence. Thus definite determiners precede the head, while indefinite and inter-
rogative determiners follow the head. Genitive (possessor) noun phrases pre-
cede the head (possessed) noun phrase, while quantifiers and adjectives fol-
low the head.
  The head of a noun phrase may be either a noun or a pronoun. As will be
shown in the ensuing discussion, the latter can admit a variety of modifying
elements.","[209, 210, 211, 212]"
"  Another particle, #έοτ kS, is probably also borrowed from Bambara ki, al-
though there it apparently does not have an interrogative function, but means
rather 'of course' or 'for sure'. It can have this meaning in Supyire as well,
but at least for some speakers it has acquired the additional meaning of
marking a yes/no question. These speakers insist that it has the same func-
tion as la. Following is an example:  (21)   Mu si        m-pä        nümpanga    k£?
         you FUT FP-come tomorrow Q
         'Are you coming tomorrow?'
528     Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts  The clause final marker bi can be used in constituent questions, but when
it is appended to a clause without any question word, it forms a simple
yes/no question, just like la: (22)    Teenzanga mit ßye sig6            c bi?
         Teenzanga also be bush.DEF in Q
         'Is Teenzanga also in the bush (i.e. at work in the field)?'","[550, 551]"
"  It was pointed out in section 12.1 of chapter 12 that information in contras-
tive focus automatically attracts the focus of assertion. It also consequently
attracts the scope of interrogation. Cleft focus constructions are quite com-
mon in yes/no questions. The only part of the proposition which is in the
scope of interrogation is the focused phrase at the head of the sentence.
Following are examples of both positive and negative cleft constructions in
yes/no questions:
                                                         14.2. Questions   531 (30) positive clefts:

       b. Tähä ρire          pi    a m)) tün?
          Q     they(EMPH) they PERF me send
          'Was it they who sent me?' (31) negative clefts:
       a. Mu ba          u pye jiigke        fböqi   '    nähä ä?
          you it.is.not he be earth.DEF owner.DEF here NEG.Q
          'Isn't it you who are the chief of the earth 9 here?'

           he PERF it give     NEG
           who gave it?'","[553, 554]"
"  Negative constituent questions are marked with the same negative inter-
rogative clause final marker (/ni/i) as negative yes/no questions. However,
instead of replacing the positive marker, as in yes/no questions, the negative
marker is placed in front of the other interrogative particle. The set of non-
participants in a specific event is of course infinite. This means that the
pragmatic situations in which a speaker would want information on the
identity of a specific non-participant are rather rare. It is often of practical
use to know why an event did not take place, however, and so negative rea-
son questions like the following are not uncommon:  (41) a. ßähä ηά mu pye      ά      pa    täpjää mä                  ye?
          what on you NEG PERF come yesterday NEG.Q                   Q
          'Why didn't you come yesterday?'
536   Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts        b. ßähä ηά mä           ye?
           what on NEG.Q        Q
           'Why not?'
14.2.2.2.jö 'who, whom, whose'Jö (or jö) is borrowed from Bambara jon 'who'. It is sometimes combined
with the Supyire root foo 'owner, person in charge' (see chapter 3, section
3.2.2.9), which takes a low tone in this context: jöfbö. The use of jö or jöfbd
indicates that the speaker believes the referent he or she is asking the iden-
tity of is a human being. Jö is accordingly treated as being gender 1 singular
for the purposes of agreement. Thus when it is the subject which is ques-
tioned, a gender 1 singular place-holding pronoun must immediately follow
the question word: (42) Jd   υ mpyi    na     cää ή-ίέέη
      who he PAST PROG FUT FP-sit
      'Who would have succeeded
        ΒAm be me k66ge           na ye?
        Babemba inheritance.DEF on Q
        Babemba (lit. sat on Babemba's inheritance)?'","[558, 559]"
"  Negative yes/no questions can be formed in two ways. One is by means of
the clause final negative question marker mä, frequently reduced to a. Nega-
tive marking in the auxiliary position is added exactly as in a declarative: (24) a. Mii s)      fi-jä                zhyd
         I   NEG.FUT FP-be.able           FP.go

            with you?'
         b. Wä ßye      ä      pa     piJägä ä?
            IND NEG PERF come night NEG.Q
            'Didn't one come last night?'
                                                                                14.2. Questions   529
The other way to form negative yes/no questions is simply by adding the
clause initial interrogative particle ti or tähä to a negative clause marked by
mi as in declaratives: (25)   a.   Tähä     ärajötji          pye        a     müga   i        yaha       mi?
             Q     radio.DEF NEG PERFopen SC leave NEG
             'Hasn't the radio been left on?'
        b.   Tä     cedrji              wä         pye    ä         si
             Q woman.DEF IND NEG PERF                               give.birth
             'Didn't a woman give birth
             nähä        ' nipjiä   mi?
             here    today          NEG
             here today?'","[551, 552]"
"  Just as with yes/no questions, speakers sometimes simply leave obvious,
presupposed information unuttered. Thus minimal questions can be formed
consisting solely of the question word plus the interrogative marker:  (40) a. Jd ye?                b. ßähä ye?
          who Q                    what Q
          'Who?'                    'What?'
        c. D) ye?               d. JüM)     ye?
           how Q                   how.much Q
           'How?'                  'How much?'",[558]
"
14.2.1.3. Focus in yes/no questionsNormally only the information that would be in the focus of assertion in the
corresponding declarative falls under the scope of interrogation in a yes/no
question. This is parallel to the way that negation is attracted to the scope of
assertion, and seems to be a general characteristic of yes/no questions in all
languages (cf. Giv6n 1990, chapter 18). Thus adverbs and adverbial phrases
attract the scope of interrogation, leaving the rest of the clause presupposed
as true. In the following example, there is no question that the addressee has
come. Only the means of arrival is in doubt: (28)    Mu ä        pa    nigisügi       na la?
         you PERF come bicycle.DEF on Q
         'Did you come on bicycle?'",[553]
"  There is one further type of complement which might be described as an
indirect question, though it takes a conditional rather than interrogative form.
In this connection note that in English indirect yes/no questions can be cast
in conditional form, as the gloss in the above example shows. In Supyire, the
use of a conditional complement indicates a subjective uncertainty or won-
dering, whereas the use of the question form indicates that a question was
actually posed. Thus conditional complements are used with yib6/yig6 only
when the main clause is reflexive. 'She asked herself...' is the Supyire way
                                       11.5. Verbs of speech and cognition   455of saying ""she wondered...'. For most speakers the conditional complement
must be in a form with an initial conditional marker ämpyi or kämpyi (for
the formation of conditionals, and the etymology of this marker, see chapter
15, section 15.1.5.1). Following is an example: (71)   U a       ύ-γέ '     yib6 ämpyi Pyäerd si   m-pä.
        she PERF she-REFL ask if         Pierre FUT FP-come
        'She wondered if Pierre would come.'","[477, 478]"
"
14.2.4. ' What about...?' questionsThere is a type of question in Supyire which solicits more information than
merely a comment on the truth of the proposition as in a yes/no question, but
does not ask for the hearer to identify a particular referent as in constituent
questions. The speaker rather asks a generalized question 'What about...? 1 ,
and the specific information desired is usually obvious from the context. The
question is marked with the final interrogative particle      which in the ex-
amples below will be glossed 'what about* in order to distinguish it from the
interrogative particles discussed in previous sections.
  There are two subtypes of 'what about1 questions. The first type consists
simply of a noun phrase with the interrogative particle appended. The ad-
dressee must infer from the speech context what information about the refer-
ent of the noun phrase the speaker is seeking. In the following example, a
master poses the question to his slave, who had previously been ordered to
fill the master's snuff box. The question therefore means something like
'What have you done with my snuffbox? 1 :  (68) Mii batärji           dt?
         my snuff.box.DEF what.about
         'What about my snuffbox?'",[568]
"Just as in declarative clefts, the information in the clause following the fo-
cused item is presupposed.
  Questions are not necessarily complete clauses. Quite often shared infor-
mation is simply left unuttered by a speaker, and the yes/no question particle
is appended to the noun or adpositional phrase which is the focus of interro-
gation. For example, in the following questions, the clause 'Are you a ...',
must be recovered from the context of use: (32) a. Nämpontjo bä?
         guest       Q
         '(Are you) a stranger?'
        b. Lüüzü la?
           hunter Q
           '(Are you) a hunter?'",[554]
"It should be noted that the type of yes/no question formed with a clause in-
itial marker tä(hä) /tähä does not take mä in the negative, but rather mir.  (152)   Τά cedrji         wä ßye      ä si  nähä '
          Q woman.DEF IND NEG PERF give.birth here
          'Didn't a woman give birth here
          nißjää me?
          today NEG
          today?'",[401]
"It should be pointed out that negative constituent questions appear to be
rather rarely used: the two just cited are the only unelicited ones occurring
in the corpus. By contrast, negative yes/no questions are relatively common:
nearly 150 unelicited examples appear in the corpus.
  Although mä used alone seems to currently carry interrogative meaning, it
is evident that it originally did not do so: when it occurs with the exclama-
tive marker de, there is no trace of interrogative function. Rather, the combi-
nation serves as an emphatic negator. In the great majority of cases, the [m]
of mä is elided:
                                                           9.4. Negation   379  (155)   a. U pye    ä        jwu nipjälä ά       de!

             'Don't insult Karaja!'","[401, 402]"
"  Occasionally one hears the particle wä, borrowed from Bambara, where it
is the most common yes/no question marker:  (20) Pi na       ma       wä?
       they PROG come.IMPFV Q
       'Are they coming?'",[550]
"
14.2.2.1. Basic structure of constituent questions  Constituent questions are doubly marked in Supyire. They contain question
words, which have no non-interrogative function (unlike the corresponding
words in languages like English or French, in which many of the question
words also function as relative pronouns), and they are marked with sentence
final interrogative particles. Three such markers are used. Most of the ques-
tion words are accompanied by the particle ye. Some speakers also occa-
sionally use bi for these question types.10 Locative questions take the final
marker k6 (usually voiced to g€).
  There are five simple question words in Kampwo Supyire, in addition to
the interrogative determiners, for which there are both ordinary and em-
phatic forms for each of the genders. Table 41 lists these question words.
Only the gender 1 singular interrogative determiners are included; for the
forms of the determiners in other genders see Tables 18 and 19 in chapter S.
'When' and 'why' are missing from the table because they are not simple
question words (see section 14.2.2.3 for 'why' and 14.2.2.6 for 'when').",[556]

Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts
1.   For a detailed attempt at a semantically based typology of different
     kinds of imperative speech acts, see Hamblin (1987: 1-45).
2.   The various characteristics of the speech act of manipulation discussed
     in this section are drawn from Givön 1990, chapter 18.
3.   Normally the imperfective of pa 'come' has strong mid tone: ma. In the
     imperative it can keep this mid tone, or it can be pronounced with a
     high tone as in the example. The latter tune is probably a relict of the
     original tune, which can be reconstructed as high on the basis of com-
     parative evidence.
4.   The subjunctive auxiliary s/has the same phonological forms as the nar-
     rative/sequential auxiliary (see chapter 9, section 9.2.6).
5.   The low tone on the imperfective subjunctive auxiliary is due to the
     floating low tone preceding the verb y wä 'go'. This verb, which is bor-
     rowed from Bambara wä 'go', is the only verb with a lexical floating
     low tone recorded so far in Kampwo Supyire.
6.   Käntugo 'back' is used metaphorically to signify one's sympathetic ac-
     quaintance, in particular members of one's patrician (cf. English
     'backing'). Note that the final vowel of Kile assimilates to the vowel of
     the following auxiliary. The combination is thus pronounced [kla:Ra].
7.   In verbal clauses, la has invariant mid tone. When it follows a predicate
     nominal, however, it undergoes tonal changes triggered by the noun as
     if it had weak mid tone.
8.   From the context it is clear that the speaker (Dog, in a folktale) expects
     the reply that Monkey is indeed not well, another way of saying that he
     is crazy. Positive bias would have expected the confirmation of the
                                                         Notes: Chapter 14   735      positive counterpart ('Monkey is well') rather than the confirmation of
      the negative. Note that the English translation 'Isn't Monkey well?' is
      biased towards a positive response, whereas the translation used in the
      example is not as obviously so biased. There is nothing in the form of
      the Supyire corresponding to this difference in English.
9.    In the Supyire culture, the 'chiefs of the earth' are different from chiefs
      of villages. The former have a certain spiritual jurisdiction over the
      land, but do not actually dispose of it, nor do they have any jurisdiction
      over people.
10.   Recall that bi without a question word forms a yes/no question (see
      section 14.2.1.1 above).
11.   The reference is to undoing a curse on the land due to a taboo being
      broken.
12.   L f r / ' h o u r , time' is borrowed from French l'heure 'the hour'.
13.    Wyere literally means 'leaves'. See chapter 12, note 4.
14.   There are of course sometimes ways of rephrasing the sentence to ex-
      clude the use of a serial construction. With the present example the ad-
      positional marking of instrument case role can be used instead of the se-
      rial verb marking, and then the direct object of the main verb can be
      questioned without difficulty:         flähä u    a      kwbn πά      gwooni  )   ye?
          what s/hePERFcut       with knife.DEF withQ
          'What did s/he cut with the knife?'","[757, 758]"
"
14.2.1.1. Basic structure of yes/no questionsThe basic structure of yes/no questions is that of a declarative sentence with
the addition of one of a number of interrogative markers. Most of these are
sentence final, but one is sentence initial.
  The most common of the yes/no interrogative markers is la: 7  (19)   a. U    si      rii-pä     la?
            she FUT FP-come Q
            'Will she come?'
         b. Cinkugo      laagä            ά     toon   nähä    nä la?
            Cenkungo distance.DEF PERF be.long here at Q
            'Is Cenkungo far from here?'",[550]
"Some speakers (significantly they seem to be younger ones) use the condi-
tional subordinator ämpyi/kämpyi even with constituent question comple-
ments, as if it were an all-purpose complementizer for indirect question
complements (note in the following example that the question marker ye is
dropped before the negative marker at the end of the sentence): (77)    Cedgi                pye             a         cd
         woman.DEF NEG PERF know
         'The woman doesn't know
         ampyi     jd         u          si            ürü             tegi        me.
         if     who s/he FUT her(EMPH) help                                        NEG
         who will help her.'",[479]
"It is also possible to place time or locative phrases in topic position in a
cleft-style question: (37)    U ta-siige             e, flähä mu ä          pyi ye?
         its LOC-begin.DEF in what you PERF do Q
         'At its ( = the feast's) beginning, what did you do?'
                                                          14.2. Questions   535  Not all constituent questions are cast in cleft form. A small minority of ex-
amples in the corpus have their question word in the place it would take in a
declarative sentence. This may be partly a result of influence from Bambara,
which does not place focused items or question words at the beginning of the
clause. It may also be due to some as yet undetected pragmatic factor(s).
Following is an example of a questioned direct object left in its normal posi-
tion: (38) Ml) f           sä ßähi jw6 kwüu              kanha na bi?
      I   SUBJUNC go what say dead(GlP) village at Q
      'What must I go say in the village of the dead?'","[557, 558]"
"
7.2. Identificational clausesThis clause type consists of a nominal or pronominal subject followed by
one of the identifier pronouns. As pointed out in chapter 5, section 5.1.2.6,
240   Chapter 7: Simple clausesSupyire has two sets of such pronouns, one ordinary and one with deictic
meaning. The identifier pronoun agrees with the subject in number and gen-
der. It's basic meaning is 'it's (a/the) X'. The predication may function to
identify, or better, classify the referent of the subject. For example, this type
of clause is often given in answer to a question such as 'What is that?' When
visiting for the purpose of greeting, a visitor is often asked why he or she
has come. A common reply is then something such as the following:  (7) YäköqkS                fwüiji        wi.
      afternoon.DEF(G2S) greeting.DEF(GlS) it.is(GlS)
      'It's (your) afternoon greeting.'","[262, 263]"

                               Introduction
1.1. The peopleThe Supyire language is spoken by the Supyire people. The noun süpyfrä, in
effect, has two meanings: 'the people' and 'the language spoken by the peo-
ple'. The word is used as a name in both senses in this grammar. The
Supyire live in southeastern Mali in the region of Sikasso (see map 1). By
tradition they came from the south, and this is probably historically accurate
since the main body of the Senufo language group, to which Supyire
belongs, is located in northern Cöte d'lvoire (see map 2).
  The Supyire are peasant farmers. They cultivate various kinds of cereals
and keep livestock. Traditional political organization did not go beyond the
village level. They have, however, been incorporated into various political
entities in the region. In the last 125 years they have successively been part
of the Jula kingdom of Sikasso, French West Africa, and finally the country
of Mali.
  The dialect described in this grammar is spoken in the region of Kampwo,
to the west of Sikasso and bordering the Bambara-speaking region of Gana
(not to be confused with the country of Ghana). The data was collected in
the village of Farakala, located 40 kilometers west of Sikasso on the main
road to the capital Bamako, and from neighboring villages, none more than
15 kilometers from Farakala.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"  Supyire also allows ""double"" questions, in which two constituents rather
than just one are questioned. In such questions, only one of the questioned
words is fronted, and the other is left in its ordinary place: (39) Jö   υ    si    rä pähä pyi an/ ye?
      who s/he FUT go what do there Q
      'Who will go do what there?'",[558]
"One also occasionally hears the phrasepähä tdrd 'what time' for 'when 1 .
14.2.2.7. taä 'where'The locative question word taä is obviously related to the locative nominaliz-
ing prefix ta- (see chapter 3, section 3.2.2.3). Both are undoubtedly derived
from a noun meaning 'place', which although it has not survived in Kampwo
Supyire, does occur in other Senufo languages (cf. Cebaara te?i 'place'). At
least one speaker has been recorded using the pronunciation tahä ([ta?ä]).
Nouns derived by the prefix ta- are in gender 2, the singular suffix for which
is -gV (definite -ke or -ge). It is therefore rather interesting that questions
formed with taä do not take the common clause final question marker ye, but
rather have an exclusively locative clause final question marker k6 (often
g6). It is probably not accidental that this same clause final marker is the
relative clause marker (see chapter 13, section 13.1).
  In all but one of the examples of locative questions occurring in the cor-
pus, the question word is placed in focus position:  (58)   a. Taä     ma                  keegt          ke?
            where you.NONDECL go.IMPFV LOC.Q
            'Where are you going?'
         b. Taä     Büwärä    ä     yiri        ηά     tire
            where Buwara PERFget.up with this(EMPH)
            'Where did Buwara get (lit. rise with) this
542   Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts           ht6 wyeere13          έ    k6?
           this magic.powder.DEF with LOC.Q
           magic powder?'","[564, 565]"
"
12.1. Focus constructionsIn Supyire, as in many languages, it is possible to distinguish two major
types of focus, which we will label ""weak"" and ""strong"" focus (cf. de Vries
1985). These labels are far from satisfactory, but in view of the termino-
logical confusion in this area, it is best to avoid more specific terms which
might be misleading. If fact what we are here calling ""weak"" focus is often
termed the ""focus of assertion"". It is that part of a proposition which at-
tracts the scope of negation (see chapter 9, section 9.4.2) and, in the corre-
sponding yes/no question, it also attracts the scope of interrogation (see
chapter 14, section 14.2.1.3). Quantifiers and adjectives also typically fall
under the scope of weak focus (see chapter 6, sections 6.3.3 and 6.4). In a
declarative sentence, the information which falls under the scope of weak
focus is frequently, but not necessarily, new. It is typically asserted against
the background of the hearer's presumed ignorance.
  In this section we will examine the most common devices used in Supyire
to encode strong focus. Strong focus is used in a number of pragmatic situ-
ations in which the speaker desires to draw particular attention to one noun
phrase (or to an adverb). It includes, for example, what is often called
""contrastive"" focus, when the speaker wishes to indicate one out of two or
more possibilities. It is also covers situations when a speaker has good rea-
son to believe that the hearer might possibly be mistaken, or is in danger of
being mistaken, and wishes to set him or her right. Finally, it includes what
468   Chapter 12: Focus and topic constructionsmight be called ""strong focus of assertion"", such as focus in replies to con-
stituent questions, and focus on new, major participants at the beginning of a
narrative (for this last, see section 12.2.1 below).","[490, 491]"
"  There are two clause initial yes/no question particles which are probably
etymologically related. The form tähä is the most common. The variant tone
tune tähä also occurs, and at least one instance of jähä has been recorded.
The other form, tä, is perhaps simply a shorter form of the same particle.
The variant kä has, however, been recorded in the speech of an old man
from Fanter61a. Following are examples of these two particles: (23) a. Tähä mu    supytibii   p)i na  ßye
         Q     your people.DEF IND PROG be
         'Are some of your people
            cyäge      kd      e?
            place.DEF IND in
            someplace (else)?'
         b. Tä \νύύ wa       ' nähä         fi-jä
            Q we      be.there be.here      FP-be.able
            'Could we please
            ta-shwonga        ta nähä mu i?
            LOC-spend.night get here you from
            have lodging here with you?'",[551]
"The same structure may be used for quite different purposes, however. The
following example is syntactically coordinate, but the second clause, by vir-
tue of the serial verb ηά '(only) afterwards', functions in reality like an ad-
verbial 'before' clause. Just as with adverbs and adverbial phrases, this ad-
396      Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negation
verbial clause attracts the scope of negation to itself (or rather, since this is a
negative yes/no question, the adverbial clause is strongly affirmed.)  (200)     Tä    Caiyyyee         pye         a               kwü
            Q Canyee       NEG PERF die
            'Didn't Canyee die
                                           4
            kä    Känhäcyee          rf                πά                 ä   kwü           mi?
            and Kanhacyee NARR afterward SC die NEG
            before           Kanhacyee did?' Lit. 'Didn't Canyee die
            and (only) then Kanhacyee died?'","[418, 419]"
"15. There is a large body of literature on so-called ""indirect speech acts"".
    See in particular Brown and Levinson (1978), Levinson (1983), and the
    comments in Givön (1990, chapter 18).
16. The form of this question is highly unusual. The interrogative deter-
    miner obviously belongs with the initial noun phrase, but is separated
    from it by the rest of the clause. No other example of this sort occurs in
    the corpus, nor was I able to induce anyone into producing parallel
    examples. Pücirii are members of ones patrician who have been mar-
    ried. Since most villages consist only of members of one patrician plus
    their wives (children belong automatically to their father's patrician),
    and since the clans are exogamous (at least in theory), the adult female
    members of one's patrician usually reside in another village. On the
    verb wyisee chapter 13, note 5.

1.  See chapter 14, note 5.
2.  Kile is the creator Sky-God. This example is taken from a folktale in
    which monkey decides to eat a human being, but determines to do it in a
    dense thicket where he is not able to see the sky when he looks up (and
    consequently the sky/God cannot see his evil deed).
3. For the use of the conditional in a relative clause, see chapter 13, sec-
    tion 13.4.2.
4. See Thompson and Longacre 1985:204f for a discussion of the phe-
    nomenon of extensive borrowing of subordinating morphemes. Such
    borrowing seems to be at least as extensive in Supyire as in the two
    Mexican languages cited by Thompson and Longacre: Yaqui and Isth-
    mus Zapotec.
5. These are common names of dogs, borrowed from Bambara.
6. See chapter 9, note 12.
7. Compare also the use of 'and' to mark conditionals in early modern
    English.
8. Dügüsön 'village festival' is borrowed from Bambara dügü 'village,
    town' and son 'worship, offer sacrifices'. The Supyire term is käsunno
    (from känhä 'village' + sun 'offer sacrifices', borrowed from the Bam-
    bara verb above). The denotatum is an annual festival to thank the tute-
    lary spirits of the village (the 'jinns') for favors during the past year and
    to pray for the coming year.
9. Bäärä 'work' is borrowed from Bambara baara 'work'.
10. This seems to be a caique on the Bambara conjunctive phrase ο bee n'a
    ta 'this all and its own'.
11. ΚίΙέ'wrench' is borrowed from French c/e/'wrench'.
12. Mekanishyingiri 'mechanics, repair work' is formed from mekanishyen
    'mechanic' (borrowed from French m6canicieti) by the addition of a
    syllable of unknown origin (plus the gender 4 suffix -rV).
13. Note the similar placement of the conjunction de in ancient Greek,
    which has a comparable function.
14. IJkää is underlyingly /hkälä/. The origin of the extra syllable [la], not
    found in the standard Bambara form hka, is at present unknown.
15. Y5 is the Supyire equivalent of the ubiquitous ο found in many if not
    most West African languages. See Singler (1988).
16. This is evidently an archaic use of the conjunction kä, which in ordinary
    language is used as a different subject narrative connective, and cannot
    be combined as here with an imperfective verb without any auxiliary.
    The current function as a different subject marker accords well with an
    etymology pointing to an earlier function as a marker of disjunction.
    The archaic nature of the present example is due to its being a proverb.
17. See chapter 13, note 7.

  The majority of constituent questions in Supyire are in the form of cleft fo-
cus constructions. The question word, or the noun phrase containing it, is
fronted to focus position at the head of the clause. The same case recover-
ability strategies are used as in clefts: a resumptive pronoun for subjects, a
gap for direct objects, and adpositional marking of the focused item for indi-
534     Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech actsrect objects (see chapter 12, section 12.1.1). The information which the
speaker and hearer share is placed in the presupposed clause following the
focused item. Following are examples illustrating a questioned subject (35a),
direct object (35b), and indirect objects (35c, d): (35) a. Jö   u      a            kü   bd ye?
         who s/he PERF            it   kill Q
         'Who killed it?'
         b. Jlähä mu mpyi    na     si   ή-kän ye?
            what you PAST PROG FUT FP-give Q
            'What would you have given?'

            what face at you.NONDECL be PROG run.IMPFV Q

            'To whom did you sell it?'","[556, 557]"
"  The second subtype of 'what about' question consists of a conditional
clause (the protasis of a conditional sentence) with the interrogative particle
d6 appended. The question means 'What if...' (and the solicited reply is the
apodosis of the conditional construction). The following example is extracted
from a discussion on how sorcerers can be detected. The speaker has just put
forward the hypothesis that the suspected person ('you' in the example) has
                                                             14.2. Questions   547

ple): (71) A: Kanhama kä        ύ tä d6?
         suffering COND him get what.about
         'What if misfortune (then) befalls (lit. gets) him?'
       B:    Aa, mu wi.
             well you it.is(GlS)
             'Well, (then) it's you.' (i.e. 'you are the sorceror who has
             brought the misfortune')The following example is taken from a conversation about whether it is right
to be envious. Speaker A has maintained that if you do not have nice things,
it is all right to spoil the nice things of other people. Speaker Β asserts you
should instead work in order to get nice things for yourself. The following
exchange then ensues (for the form of the conditional, see chapter 15, sec-
tion 15.1.5.1): (72) A: Mu si ' gä         m-pyi mu si     ß-jä
         you ADV COND IP-be you FUT FP-be.able

             well you HAB rest-IMPFV NEG.Q
             'Don't you (j u s t ) be contented (lit. rest) (with what you
             have)?'","[569, 570]"
"This focused item may be questioned, as the following example shows:
                                                          14.2. Questions   545

         'What did you find Zhye had killed?'","[567, 568]"
"  There are logically three ways that a cleft construction can combine with
negation: 1) the focused part is negated, and the presupposed part affirma-
tive ('it wasn't X that did Y'); 2) the focused part is affirmative, and the pre-
supposed part negated ('it was X that didn't Y'); or 3) both parts can be ne-
gated ('it wasn't X that didn't Y'). Of these, only 1) occurs unelicited in the
corpus. The practical occasions in which the addressee mistakenly believes
                                                    12.1. Focus constructions 473X to have not done Y are much rarer than those in which s/he mistakenly
believes X to have done Y. In 1) and 3) above, the negation of the focused
element is indicated by placing after it the negative identifier bä 'it is not'.
The negative clause final particle which goes with it is placed not after this
initial clause, but at the end of the sentence, after the presupposed clause.
The syntactic role of the focused item is recovered in exactly the same way
as in affirmative clefts. Following are examples with various syntactic roles
focused. They are all type 1) above, viz. with focus, but affirmative presup-
posed clause. Note that many of them are cast in the form of negative yes/no
questions, which have a strong bias toward an affirmative response, just as
in English. (14) a. subject, coreferential pronoun

"This book could never have been brought to completion without a lot of help
in the carving. First, of course, are the Supyire people, my neighbors and
friends in Farakala, who patiently put up with the indignity of having their
mouths stared at while they talked, who good-humoredly answered hundreds
of what must have appeared to be completely inane questions, and who
submitted with good grace to being taped on all sorts of topics. Special
thanks are due to the men who assisted me in collecting and transcribing
texts: Kafono Sanogo, Lamin Sanogo, Yaya Sanogo, Kleno Sanogo, Brema
Diamoutane, and above all, Ely Sanogo, who ""said it again"" and ""said it
slowly"" innumerable times.
  Special thanks are also due to my professors at Oregon, Colette Craig,
Scott DeLancey, Russell Tomlin, and above all T. Givön for comments,
suggestions, and criticisms. Their influence is evident on every page of this
grammar.
  To my colleagues at the Direction Nationale                 d'AIphab6tisation
FonctioneUe et de Linguistique Appliqu6e in Bamako who helped in getting
visas and in other practical ways I owe special thanks, in particular to N'Do
Cisse, who at the time when I first went to Mali was the researcher
responsible for Senufo languages at the Direction. Over the years he has
been very supportive.
  Many other people in Mali and in the United States have helped in
hundreds of practical ways. Tom and Doris Payne aided and abetted with
meals and housing. Betty Valentine reminded me of impending deadlines
and got me out of the soup when I didn't meet them. Ralph and Ruth Herber,
missionaries with the Christian and Missionary Alliance, graciously allowed
me the use of the notes they had accumulated during years of work in Mali.
Joke Gosker, of the same mission, was a great moral support while we were
both trying to master the arcane tone rules of Supyire. I especially shyier6
my fellow Senufoists Glenn and Linn Boese and Dave and Karen DeGraaf,
who were ready at all hours to look for the answers to unreasonable
questions like: ""Does Nyarafolo front distributive relativized noun phrases in
vi   Preface
conditional relatives?"", and who proof-read above and beyond the call of
duty.
  Last of all, my undying gratitude to my long-suffering wife Joyce and
daughter Anne, who put up with what must be one of the most trying experi-
ences known to our species: living with a linguist writing a book. The criti-
cism they lavished on me over the breakfast table was doubtless richly de-
served, and a negligible revenge for having their conversation dissected.
  To all these, and to anyone else who helped carve this book, I say the
traditional Supyire blessing:                    Kile ύ nipyahawa yaha kuru cyag6 e.
                       May God put a lot in its place.","[6, 7]"

14.2.5. The non-interrogative use of questionsAs in many languages, questions can sometimes be put to non-interrogative
use in Kampwo Supyire.15 There are many such uses, but only one will be
illustrated here: the cross-linguistically common practice of using rhetorical
questions to introduce a new thematic section. This device is apparently con-
fined to procedural and expository discourse in Supyire. The following rhe-
torical questions are all taken from one discourse explaining Supyire burial
customs. Each question begins a new thematic paragraph dealing with the
topic raised by the question:  (73) a. Sänyi                  mäha sä jw6

                         Interclausal connections
This chapter describes the types of interclausal connection which have not
been covered in previous chapters. As might be expected for a category de-
fined negatively in this way, the clause types described here are extremely
varied both in form and function. They can however be broadly separated
into two groups: adverbial clauses and coordinate clauses.
  It should be stated at the outset that ""adverbial clause"" is used only as a
convenient functional label. There is no set of structural correlates serving to
define the clauses gathered under the term in the way there is for relative
clauses or verb complements. Just as adverbs are an eclectic mix of various
subtypes of words which do not fall obviously into more homogenous
classes, the clauses treated here as adverbial vary widely in both structure
and function.
  Structurally, coordinate sentences are not such a mixed bag as the adver-
bial clauses. Simple juxtaposition of clauses as well as contrastive and alter-
native coordination are covered briefly in section 1S.2 below. The more
elaborate system of clause chaining is dealt with in the final section, 15.3.","[570, 571, 572]"
"  All relative clauses in Supyire, then, are restrictive. They serve to restrict
the reference or interpretation of the noun they modify (though see below on
488   Chapter 13: Relative clauses""afterthought"" relatives). In the most typical case, the speaker provides in-
formation in the relative clause which allows the addressee to uniquely iden-
tify the referent of the modified noun. In order to accomplish this function,
the information provided must be about the referent, and must be known to
or inferable by the addressee. Relative clauses thus contain a noun phrase
which is coreferential with the noun phrase being modified in the main
clause, and the information they contain is most often treated as presupposed
by speakers (cf. Givdn 1990, chapter 15).1 It is not surprising that such
clauses share basic characteristics with cleft focus constructions and the
commonest type of constituent questions, both of which consist of an initial
noun phrase followed by a clause containing presupposed information. Nei-
ther of these constructions derive historically from the present day relative
clause construction, however.
   Relative clauses in Supyire are unembedded. 2 The most typical variety,
with definite, referential heads, are preposed to the main clause. The relative
clause is terminated by the clause final relative marker k6, frequently voiced
to g6, and is typically followed by a short pause before the main clause. 3 (2) Yaag6      ka a       ύ   bd k6,    mu a  kürü   c6.
     thing.DEF it PERF him kill REL you PERF it(EMPH) know
     'The thing that killed him, you know it.'
      Freely: 'You know the thing that killed him'The etymology of k6 is not certain, but it is undoubtedly related to the loca-
tive question marker of the identical form k6 (see chapter 14, section
14.2.2.7). A connection between a locative question word or marker and the
relative clause marker is attested in a number of languages (see Givön
1990b, where Krio, modern Greek, southern colloquial German, and Bam-
bara are cited). Both the relative k6 and the interrogative k6 are quite likely
derived from the gender 2 singular demonstrative r)k6. The corresponding
relative marker in Cebaara is      which is probably derived from the gender
3 singular demonstrative tee. In Cebaara the marker is generally placed after
the verb rather than at the end of the relative clause. This placement and the
demonstrative etymology can be taken as indications that the markers had a
nominalizing function originally.
  As noted above, in the canonical relative clause construction there are two
coreferential noun phrases, one in the relative clause and one in the main
clause. The first of these we will call the ""relativized noun phrase"". It is in
some respects like the ""head"" noun phrase in a language like English, since
it comes first in the construction and is more fully specified. The noun
phrase in the following main clause, which is typically pronominalized, will
be labeled simply as the ""coreferential noun phrase"". The relativized noun
phrase is most frequently placed at the beginning of the relative clause, and
may or may not be additionally marked with an ordinary demonstrative or
                        13.1. Basic structure and function of relative clauses   489with a relative determiner. The coreferential noun phrase typically takes the
form of an emphatic pronoun (e.g. uru, pire, etc.; see section 13.3 below for
a discussion of the use of these pronouns), and occurs in the position it
would normally take in the clause (that is, it is most often not focused). The
following example (as well as the previous one) illustrates all these features.
In it the relativized noun phrase is the subject of the relative clause, and the
coreferential noun phrase is likewise the subject of the main clause: (3) Pücwdgi         u          jjye ηά mu f ke,
     girl.DEF(GlS) she(GlS) be with you with REL
     'The girl who is with you,

      she will die.'
      Freely: 'The girl who is with you will die.'","[510, 511, 512]"
"Similarly, occasionaly a speaker will request confirmation of one bit of in-
formation that he or she didn't hear properly, or simply can't believe: (33) a. Kücwuun lä?

14.2.1.4. Alternative questionsAlternative questions, which invite the addressee to choose one member of a
disjunction, are formed by means of the ""disjunction"" läa 'or', and have no
specifically interrogative morphology. Following are some examples. The
first presents a disjunction of declaratives, the second a disjunction of sub-
junctives (hortatives):  (34) a. Ciß-jytebft          ύ    lwoh6   e

"  The second example above shows that dl rather than jlähä is often used
when the requested item is something spoken. The standard way of asking
someone's name is accordingly:  (49) D)   mu wäge           jiye ye?
       how your name.DEF be Q
       'What is your name?' (cf. French: Comment t'appelles-tu?)   Questions with dl often include the verb jwo 'say' as the second verb in a
 serial verb construction. Although it is clearly grammaticalized in this func-
tion (shown by the fact that it can follow itself—the verb jwo—see example
 (50c)), just what the function is remains obscure. The speakers I consulted
 on the issue insisted that the question means the same thing with or without
 the jwo. One speaker said that often the question sounds more ""natural"" with
jwo, but was unable to say why. The following examples are offered for the
 reader to ponder:  (50) a. Dl mil si     i}g6 baqi        jyiile fi-jwö ye?
          howl   FUT this river.DEF cross FP-say Q

           'How did I recount my own?'","[561, 562]"
"For many speakers, other items are also sometimes not questionable in com-
plement clauses of this sort. In the following example, some of the people I
consulted on the issue stated that the locative could only belong to the main
clause, not to the complement clause, in spite of the seeming pragmatic bi-
zarreness of such an interpretation (other speakers found that meaning (65b)
was perfectly acceptable, however):  (65)   Tai       Müsä ä         jwo na           Ali     έ              käiig6?
         where Musa PERF say that Ali PERF go                                  LOC.Q
         a. 'Where was Musa when he said Ali had gone?'
            (location of Musa questioned)
         b. ?'Where is it that Musa said Ali had gone?'
            (destination of Ali questioned)
544     Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts
  With the more tightly integrated complements of manipulative and percep-
tion verbs, the subject can always be questioned since it is also the direct ob-
ject of the main clause:  (66) Jö pi    a    tim   ύ            i   sä Pyiiri yydre ye?
       who they PERF send s/he.COMP PERF go Pierre call Q
       'Whom did they send to call Pierre?'","[566, 567]"
"  ""Semi-embedding"" as illustrated in the above examples cannot simply be
dismissed as ""performance"" errors. They are not examples of restarting a
sentence in midstream. Speakers do not regard them in any way as odd or in-
elegant, and willingly supply additional examples.
  It appears, then, that this type of construction represents the beginning of a
process which may end in the full embedding of relative clauses. In the pre-
sent state of the language, however, relative clauses are like the complement
clauses in being neither embedded nor independent. Like complement
clauses, they are marked as subordinate by a specific morpheme, in this case
the relative clause marker k6. Internally they are further marked by either
the fronting of the relativized noun phrase or the use of a relative pro-

that the relative clause cannot simply be analyzed as some sort of topic
clause adjoined by simple parataxis to another independent clause.

                      Non-declarative speech acts
Most if not all languages distinguish three major sentence types: declarative,
imperative, and interrogative (Sadock and Zwicky 1985). Supyire, in com-
mon with all the Senufo languages, conforms to this generalization. The bulk
of this grammar is devoted to declaratives, in conformity with descriptive
tradition. This tradition is probably due to the twin factors of the greater
text-frequency of declaratives and to the greater degree of syntactic elabora-
tion usually found in declaratives (Givön 1990, chapter 18). This chapter in
contrast is devoted entirely to the description of the other two sentence
types.
  The three major sentence types can be conceived of as grammaticalized
means of performing three major functions of language: to convey informa-
tion (declarative), to give orders, requests, invitations or the like
(imperative), and to elicit information (interrogative). In Supyire, as in many
languages, imperatives are principally distinguished by what they lack
(subject, auxiliary) in comparison to other clause types. There is also one
auxiliary used exclusively in a subtype of imperative. Also dealt with in this
chapter is the use of the subjunctive to accomplish a politer manipulation
than the ""bare"" imperative.
   Questions in Kampwo Supyire are a more marked sentence type than either
imperatives or declaratives. All questions have some sort of interrogative
particle at the end or, in a few cases, at the beginning of the sentence. In ad-
dition, in constituent (""wh"") questions, the use of question words and, in the
majority of questions, the use of the cleft focus construction also mark the
clause as different.
   A further characteristic distinguishing both imperatives and interrogatives
from declaratives is the use of the non-declarative set of first and second
person pronouns (for the form of these pronouns see chapter 5, section
5.1.1.2). These special pronouns are not obligatory in imperatives and ques-
tions, and in fact, ordinary first and second person pronouns are even more
common in these sentence types. Further, the first person singular non-de-
clarative pronoun na cannot be used as subject. On the other hand, the non-
declarative pronouns cannot be used in declarative sentences, except in three
functions: as reflexive genitive possessors (see chapter 6, section 6.2.1), as
genitive possessors in vocatives (first person only), and in exclamations. Ex-
amples of the latter two functions are:
518   Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts (1) a. vocative, genitive possessor
         Na               cevoo mpi, m)i       canmpyi-tanra-wüύηί

         'The owner of the cow has caught me!'","[537, 538, 539, 540, 541]"
"  Transitivity also affects acceptability of questioning items in complement
clauses. In the loosely bound complements of verbs of speech, the subject of
an intransitive verb can be questioned (note that the same strategy of a re-
sumptive pronoun in subject position is used): (63)    Jd    Müsä ä           jwo na     u        a              kärd     ye?
         who Musa PERF say that s/he PERF go                               Q
         'Who did Musa say left?",[566]

larity, insistence, or politeness. These are generally small, one syllable
words which often cliticize onto the preceding word. Table 29 gives some of
the common markers.",[209]
"If both verbs are transitive, the direct object of the first (61a) can be ques-
tioned in the ordinary way (i.e. by means of placing the question word in fo-
cus position), but this is not possible with the direct object of the second
verb (61b):  (61) a. Jlähä u a          täha ä kyaäre     kwbn ye?

"  The focused noun phrase containing the question word is not always
moved to the absolute beginning of the sentence. It may be preceded by a
phrase in topic position, from which it is typically separated by a pause. The
topic usually delimits a domain within which the desired information is to be
sought. Thus in the following example, taken from a riddle-like story, the an-
swer to the question is to be chosen from the list in topic position: (36) Ρ ire         näfljiibii   shüünnirji
