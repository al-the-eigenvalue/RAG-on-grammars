Acknowledgements
  First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to three ladies, without whose
assistance this thesis would never have been completed.
  Two of them come from Bougainville. Dora Leslie initiated me into her beautiful
language, taught me and answered my endless questions with utmost patience. Therese
Minitong Kemelfield told lots of interesting stories to me. Her fervent discussions on
Siwai culture were ever so inspiring. For both of them, the last four years must have
been the most dreadful time in their lives --- their mothers and other close relatives were
suffering from the political conflict on the island, and there was no way for them even
to communicate with their own people most of the time. In spite of this frustrating
situation, they never failed to address me with warmth in their hearts. All their family
members living in Australia have become very good friends of my family as well.
  Ulrike Mosel, my supervisor in chair, assisted me to write the thesis from beginning
to end with meticulous care. Before starting my PhD, I was virtually a novice in
writing a grammar. I saw the last four years as my apprenticeship, and she was the
most worthy Meisterin. She taught me not only how to write a grammar, but also how
to enjoy writing a grammar. Her liberal and flexible way of thinking very often saved
me from mental exhaustion.","[4, 5, 6]"

(2) In interrogative sentences with question words such as ua 'what', woo 'where', paa
'who': question words are pronounced with a high pitch. cf. paa 'who' in Figure 2-13
below. The end of the sentence is signalled by a falling pitch after the final stressed

(4) The discourse markers nee and nehe play a similar role to tag questions in English
(§9.1.4 and §9.1.5). They may be placed at the end of a sentence, or after the first
word in a sentence. In the former case, the first mora ne is pronounced with a sharp
rising pitch, which is followed by a sharp falling pitch of the second morae in nee'' or
he in nehe (cf. F0 extract of nehe in Figure 2-15 below). In the latter case nee and nehe
are marked by the same kind of rising and falling pitch (cf. F0 extract of nehe in Figure
2-16 in page 36). The intonation pattern of the end of the sentence is just like that of a
declarative sentence in such a case. Compare the F0 contour of aai of paaina in Figure
2-16 with that in Figure 2-12.",[64]

    Note that the attachment of a number suffix to a noun is optional. It is not used
when the number of the object in question is obvious from the context. Inanimate
nouns c;lo not usually inflect for dual and paucal. 7
Examples:
4-14         kupuri 'a stone/stones'
             kupuri-ngung '(many) stones'
7 I could find no examples of inanimate nouns marked by the dual or the paucal suffix in my corpus.
According to my informants, however, they can be marked by either of these if the duality or paucality
of the object referred to by the noun is focused on.
Nouns                                                                                              734-15        nommai 'a person/people'

            nommai-naa 'a few/several persons'
            nommai-ngung '(many) people'
    The initial /k/ of the dual suffix /-karol is often realised as ng. A similar phenomenon
is observed as regards all the case suffixes which begin with /k/ (the ergative /-kif, the
purposive /-ko/, the ablative /-kitee/ and the locative /-koril). The morphophonemic
processes which apply to all these suffixes are informally summarised as follows.''
       Rule 4-1    Realisation of /kl in the Dual Suffix /-karol and Other Suffixes
            When /k/ is preceded by the archinasal IN/, it is obligatorily realised as ng.
            It is realised either k or ng when it is preceded by a sequence of a nasal or a
            velar stop and a vowel, or by a high or back vowel. The more phonemes of
            this type exist in adjacent syllables, the more it is likely to be realised as
            ng.s
Examples:
4-16        nungamong-ngaro 'two men'
            koringono-karo/-ngaro 'two enemies'
            poo'ki-karo/-ngaro 'two babies'
            kuraisa-karo/-ngaro 'two women'
            ko'sa-karo 'two shells/friends'
            honghah-karo 'two female prawns'
    The following nouns denoting human beings have distinct plural forms:4-17        Singular                                  Plural
            pehkoro 'young boy'                       pehkonooh 'young children'

            hongoponori 'old man'                     hongoponongu 'adults/elder people'
            hanganori 'old woman'
    When one refers to or addresses one's kin such as one's parent/child-in-law or
brother/sister-in-law, one uses no~ingular (most frequently paucal) forms to express8 However, when case suffixes are preceded by pronouns, the article or the demonstrative, lkJ may be
realised asj, or may be fused with preceding vowels. cf. Chs 5 and 6. See also Rule 4-5 in §4.4 for
special morphophonemic rules which apply to the ergative suffix.

"6.2.2 The Article as a Determiner
  The article as a determiner indicates that the noun phrase is specific. It may be
definite or indefinite. For example, observe the following sentence at the beginning of
a story:
1 The article tii may be regarded as a dual-paucal gender form; in that case, however, the noun kuraisawould be marked by the dual suffix -karo or the paucal suffix -naa to avoid confusion.
The Article and the Demonstrative                                                                                              1396-4            hoo-jori                poti       u 'kisa                   tu-ki-na                      tii     kuraisa

               one-CL.human.F
               'Once upon a time lived a woman ... ' (1-1)
Here kuraisa 'woman' is indefinite, as indicated by the 'number one' numeral classifier
na-ra (cf. §8.2.2.1.2), but at the same time it is determined by the article, because it
refers to a specific entity. On the other hand, in the following phrase, kuraisa 'wo-\Pen'
is indefinite and non-specific, and hence cannot be determined by the article:6-5                  kuraisa       peeko-ng                             sikuulu            hanna ...

               '... a girls' big school(= high school) .. .' (11-30)
   Similarly, a noun phrase which refers to a whole class in a generic sentence, such as
nommai 'people/human beings' in 6-6, does not take the article.6-6            he'ee!        nee                ho-ko                            nang kuhro                nommai-ki

               (any) human beings.' (XXV -76)
   Noun phrases with proper names or personal pronouns as their heads are inherently
specific, and can be used with (as in 6-7a and 6-8a) or without (as in 6-7b and 6-8b)
the article:6-7a           Tantanu-ki                          roki            noh-u-r-u-ng: ""... ""

not take the article:
1) predicates in nominal clauses, as ko'sa-karo '(two) friends' in:6-9         u'kisa         tii         napa-nno        mahkata-nno         ko 'sa-karo.

            'Long ago the possum and the dog were friends.' (IV -2)
2) the Complements of certain intransitive (6-1 0) and transitive (6-11) verbal predicates:6-10        hoo hoo                oa 'pai          tu-ro-ng.

           'The butterfly up there, you should know, is called 'swallowtail'.' (XXIII-
           46)
Note that in 6-      the second article hoo functions as a topic marker. cf. §6.2.6.
3) terms of address, as in:6-12       oi             po-owot.
           hey            my .brother-in-law
           'Hey, my brother-in-law.' (V-14)
  Nominal predicates or the Complements of verbal predicates may occasionally be
determined by the demonstrative. In the following sentence, for example, the head of
the nominal predicate nii 'me' takes the demonstrative ong in deictic function .6-13       ... ho-ko             ong         nii.

  Remote Past 1-u/ describes an event which took place long ago (at least more than a
year or so before the speech moment), and which has no relevance to the present
situation. It is rarely used with totally stative verbs (1) (but see 15-61 below).
  This is the TAM which is used most frequently in my corpus of traditional narra-
tives, in which the narrator describes past events objectively. For example, see the
following sequence of sentences, in which all the main verbs are in Remote Past.

     The narrator can, however, freely switch to Present to achieve the vivid description
of a past event. cf. § 15.3.2.
     I have only one example of the copula tu(h)- in Remote Past in my corpus:15-61         ong         waasiih hoo                     napa-nno              mahkata-nno              u'kisa

According to my informants, tu(h)- in this context means that they were enemies to
each other after they had lived together, but it does not specify whether that relation has
lasted till now or not.
13   napa-nno ... tu'ni is a Possessor attributive clause. cf. §17.1.

  Future /-hee-tu(h)/ describes an event or state which will take place any time after the

   Immediate Future /-hee-MID-ko/ describes an event or state which is about to take

          Imaginative is also used to express hypothetical ( 15-75) or counterfactual meanings

           Dependent embedded clauses with verbs in Defmite Future function as the Comple-
      ments or the peripheral arguments of the superordinate predicates, and may either
      precede or follow them.
           Verbs which take Definite Future verbal clauses as Complements include haa- 'to
      agree/want' and kaah- 'to disagree/not to want' (§ 14.3.1.1), haa-jee- 'to need/want'
      (§14.6.1), tiik- 'to say' (§14.3.1.2), mi'no- 'to instruct sb' and tiih- 'to tell sb'

15.4.1 Overview
     Motuna has five ""medial"" TAM suffixes which mark switch-reference.
     As will be discussed in Ch 17, the clause which has a verb marked by one of these
suffixes as head is syntactically non-embedded in most cases. 21 It is, however, usually
followed 22 by another clause which ""controls"" its TAM and SS/DS marking. I will call
the clause which has a medial verb as head ""marked clause"", and the clause which
controls its TAM and SS/DS marking ""controlling clause"".23
     Among the five medial suffixes, the General SS, General DS and Perfect SS suffixeS
are primarily attached to the stems of dynamic verbs (mainly verbs (3) and (4), and
sometimes verbs (2) when the focus is on unstable or habitual states, or on the incep-
tion phases of states). The Continuous SS and DS suffixes, on the other hand, are
primarily attached to those of stative verbs ((1), (2), (3b) and (4b)). Schematically,
                                          SS suffix                  DS suffix
       dynamic verb stem +                Perfect /-ro/              General /-ku/
                                          General /-mol
       stative verb stem +                Continuous /-if            Continuous 1-juu/
     Roughly speaking, the temporallaspectual concepts expressed by the General and
Perfect SS suffixes are covered by the General DS suffix, and those expressed by the
Continuous SS suffix are covered by the Continuous DS suffix. But, as will be seen
below, they are not exactly symmetrical.","[483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493]"
"17 The interjections ehe'ehee 'hi, hi, hi (imitation of laughter)', u'uung 'yes', he'ee 'no' and hu'uung
'no' are exceptions. The glottal stop /Q/ is directly followed by the vowel /e/ and /u/ in these words.
cf. §9.5.
18 I allow sequences, which are not permissible in surface syllable structure, in the underlying formsof bound morphemes. For example, many verb roots end with consonants which can not occur in coda
position. e.g. /kuuk-/ 'to know', /hoHk-/ 'to throw sth towards sb', /tokis-/ 'to cut'.
19   There are no suffixes which begin with /HI or /Q/.
Phonology                                                                                                  23     Phonetically, the residue of a vowel before /Q/ is often heard after the release of the
glottal closure (e.g. naa'ru [na:?(a)ru] 'lazy'). 20 The residue of a vowel before /HI is
also occasionally heard after the pronounciation of [h] (e.g. ihkita [th(t)ktta]). This
vowel after[?] or [h] is not considered as phonemically distinctive, because: (1) the
vowel in this position is always the repeated version of the vowel before /Q/ or /HI, and
(2) it does not occur in word final position.","[51, 52]"

(1) ah 'oh, no!': expression of disgust or disagreement. cf. 9-1.
(2) hii, ih, iih, hiih, ii 'oh dear!, look!': they are the expressions of surprise or disap-

are the signals to attract his/her attention. (See also 9-4, 9-7, etc.)9-71         ii.!     ana     poopito     koto    hia      ua?      mono-ji-ng.

  The person/number of possessive pronouns (both in free and bound forms) are
distinguished in the same way as those of bound pronouns (§4.4.4.1) and :e.~phatic.,
pronouns (§5.2.2).
  Free possessive pronouns consist of bound stems and gender suffixes. Bound
stems are further analysable as the combinations of bound personal pronouns and the
suffix /-ko/, except for the 1st person singular form. The underlying forms of bound
possessive pronouns are given below:

        3rd           poko-                   peeko-
  Bound possessive pronouns are combined with classifiers via the linker /-no-/ in
classifier constructions, as in the following examples. See further discussion in

  Free possessive pronouns take suffixes which cross-reference the genders of their
head nouns, i.e. Possessees. Gender suffixes are: /-ng/ (masculine), /-nal (feminine),
/-nil (dim'IV\~Ative and dual-paucal) and /-no/ (local). Note that the forms in dimirtutive
and dual-paucal gender are the same. cf. Table 4-2 in §4.2.1.
  The paradigm of free possessive pronouns is given below. The columns refer to the
person/number of the possessive pronouns (Possessors), while the rows refer to the
genders of the head nouns (Possessees).","[158, 159, 160]"
"9.4.1 The Coordinating Conjunction jii 'and, or, also, either'
   The conjunction jii 'and, or, also, either' conjoins two or more words, phrases, or
clauses, at the same syntactic level. The speaker either lists     or contrasts the
entities/events referred to by the elements conjoined by jii. In the former case, jii is

  The suffix -nno is used to conjoin two nouns within a noun phrase. Note that the
syntactic function of this suffix differs from that of the comitative case suffix -nno
which conjoins two NPs. cf. §3.2.2.3 and 9-53 above.
  In the following example, two nouns nuka and umoka, coordinated by the suffix
-nno, constitute the head of the ergative noun phrase tii-ngi nuka-nno umoka-nno.9-54       ... tii-ngi            nuka-nno         umoka-nno       no-m-u-'-na: ""... ""

           ' ... my mother and father said to me: "".. .''' (VI-10)
  In the following example, the noun phrase poowoi-nno by itself constitutes the head
of an absolutive noun phrase, which functions as a term of address:9-55       oi      po-owoi-nno.
           hey     my-brother-in-law-and
           'Hey, brother-in-law (and someone else).' (V-17)
                                         ~tVr\s.
In this case, the suffix -nno indicates/\as if the speaker addresses not only the listener
referred to by po-owoi, but another person who is not overtly referred to. This is a
device to express politeness towards the addressee with the implication of duality. cf.
§4.2.2.

9.4.3.1 impa 'and then, now'
   The local noun impa 'this time, now' (cf. §4.4.2.5) functions as NP head. Like any
local nouns/pronouns, it can function as an adverbial modifier of a verb by itself:9-56          hoo      nee          muumiaku           impa         patak-u-i=to-ng.

              'The lord(= my dearest son) must be arriving now.' (1-10)
    The conjunction impa, on the other hand, is used to connect a clause with a preced-
ing independent clause (as in 9-58 and 9-59) or medial clause (as in 9-57). It is always
placed at the beginning of a second clause, introducing the description of an event
which the speaker wants to focus on. It is often used to introduce a new topic in the
discourse (as in 9-58b and 9-59).9-57          umi-ro                       impa               ruu         ong      angumuuka

    The conjunction mannilma'ni5 'then, so, certainly' is also used to connect a clause
with a preceding independent clause (as in 9-60b) or medial clause (as in 9-60a). It
indicates that the speaker is going to describe an event, which logically or naturally5   The form ma'ni is attested only a few times in the texts by two female speakers.

(9-61). It may be placed at the beginning of a clause {9-60a), or after the first or
second word of the clause, especially after the sentential topic (9-60b and 9-61).9-60a       tiwo=tiih-ku                                                    haa-u-u-na

            'No! She certainly(= as you suspected) did not move.' (VII-47)
    It is often used in combination with the conjunction tiko. See 9-62d in §9.4.3.3.9.4.3.3 tiko 'and, then, so'
   The conjunction tiko 'and, then, so' probably derives from the local article tii in the
purposive case.
   Tiko introduces an independent clause, and connects it to the preceding clause which
is also usually independent. 6 It indicates the temporal or logical sequence of a chain of
events. Observe the following sequence of sentences at the beginning of a narrative:9-62a       kupuna-no-ru                     hoo         Siuai-no-po                         ong      tui

6             -a~c;.~
  I \:-.~ve a fewl\examples where the preceding clause is a medial clause. Such a medial clause,
however, may be regarded as a separate sentence on a phonological ground (cf. §2.8 and§ 17.1). e.g.:
            haaro'-ro             manni.         tiko         jeewo-ning       koto   ngo-woro-hee?

             'And so, one day, Paanaangah dug a young tree.' (XIV -4)
Note that in 9-62d, where the narrator describes an activity which is the consequence of
the situation described in 9-62a- c, she uses the conjunction manni in addition to tiko.9.4.3.4      hoo(=hoo) 'so, now, then'
  The conjunction hoo(=hoo) 'so, now, then' obviouly derives from the masculine
form of the article hoo, which vaguely summarises the background situation expressed
in the previous clause (9-63) or understood from the context (9-64 and 9-65). The
second hoo, which is optional, derives from the same article functioning as a topic
marker. (The second hoo, if present, is invariably stressed. cf. §6.2.6.) Hoo( =hoo)
thus introduces a sentence or a clause, often with a new topic, with a certain illocution-
ary force:9-63         roo           tii          manni        toku      kumar-i-heeta-na.        hoo=hoo

             'You will certainly not laugh. Then (if you laugh) the Giant will smell us,
             and immediately come.' (VIII -11)9-64         hoo=hoo             impa      hoo       ngo-m              poti    pata '-ko-ng.

          her.' (V-40)9.4.3.5    tiko(=hoko) 'because'
  The conjunction tiko 'because' seems to derive from the local article tii in purposive
case, and the optional hoko from the masculine article hoo with the emphatic suffix -ko;)
The conjunction tiko( =hoko) is always placed at the beginning of an independent
clause, which denotes the cause of the event described by the previous independent
clause.9-66      impa-ko        hoo    toku      mu-kui-na.          tiko=hoko        hoo     Sande

  The conjunction roruki 'but, however' expresses that the sentence contrasts with the
previous sentence, or with something which is understood from the context. It may be
placed at the beginning of a clause (9-68b), or after the word which focuses on such
contrast (e.g. after the negator toku and the discourse marker nah-ah 'possibly' in
9-69b).

9.5        INTERJECTIONS  Interjections are the words which either can constitute single utterences by them-
selves, or are syntactically isolated from other elements in a sentence. They can be
subcategorised as follows:
( 1) emotive interjections
(2) interjections for attracting attention
(3) interjections for response
(4) filler words
  The endings of emotive interjections, and some interjections for response, are
characterised by a level high pitch (cf. §2.8).
  Note that in some interjections, such as ehe;ehee 'laughter', u'uung 'yes', hu'uung
'no' and he'ee 'no', a glottal stop occurs between vowels, which is not permissible in
general phonotactic rules (cf. §2.4.1).","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245]"

   My final word of thanks is due to Ayuko, Takashi and our newly-born little Motona.
 They created a joyful family environment which I regard as the most valuable thing in
 my life. I could get myself refreshed whenever I spent time with them. Our second
 son's name was taken from the language name ""Motuna"" with slight modification
 according to Japanese phonology. His name will always remind me and my family of
 the years we spent in Canberra, and of our special friendship with Motuna speakers.

Abstract
  This thesis is a descriptive grammar of Motuna, a Non-Austronesian language
spoken by several thousand people in the south-western part of Bougainville (called
Siwai), Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Buin Family of the Eastern Bougainville
stock, in the Bougainville Phylum. This grammar is based on the analysis of narrative
texts provided by four speakers of the standard Motuna.
  Motuna is a both head and dependent marking agglutinative language with complex
morphology. Like most Non-Austronesian languages in Papua NewGuinea, it is verb
final, and has medial and non-medial verbal categories. In addition, verbs have basic
voice distinction between active and middle voices, and have extensive tense/as-
pect/mood categories. Nouns have six genders and are also classified by fifty-one
classifiers.
  Chapter 1 discusses the typological characteristics, as well as the genetic relations
and dialectal variations of Motuna. It also briefly summarises previous work done on
this language, and provides the scope and data base of this thesis.
  Chapter 2 deals with phonetics, phonology and orthography. It includes an introduc-
tion to morphophonemics which will be discussed fully in later chapters, particularly in
Chapter 4 (nouns), Chapter 8 (classifiers, numerals and the 'all' quantifier), and
Chapter 13 (verbal morphology).
  Chapter 3 outlines the word-classes and the clausal syntax of this language. Chap-
ters 4 - 9 deal with the mopho-syntax of all the word classes except for verbs, partici-
ples and verbal nouns. Chapter 10 discusses the internal structure of the NP, and
Chapter 11 possessive, kinship and other constructions.
  Chapter 12 outlines the morpho-syntax of verbs. I give a gist of verbal morphology
in this chapter, so that readers may skip Chapter 13 which is a lengthy discussion of
complicated verbal morphology. Chapter 14 discusses valency of verbs including
valency-changing derivations (stimulative, causative, applicative and reciprocal).
Chapter 15 deals with tense/aspect/mood. Chapter 16 deals with two word classes
derived from verbs .,.-- verbal nouns and participles.
  Chapter 17 discusses the interclausal relations in Motuna, mainly chaining of medial
verbs and relative clauses.
  Finally, three narative texts of this language are provided in Appendix.

    Since the person and number of A and 0 NPs are obligatorily cross-referenced, in
 many cases A and/or 0 NPs can be left unexpressed without confusion. Thus the basic
· word order and case-markings of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses are:
 13 In other words, the ergative suffix marks the A argument which is not a sentential topic. In elicitation sessions, my informants sometimes marginally accepted sentences in which A NPs in
 ergative case are sentential topics at the same time. But I have found no such sentence in my entire
 corpus of narratives and daily conversation. This fits Wierzbicka's argument that 'the ergative marks
 the peripheral (less topical) actant' ( 1981: 69).

As discussed above, the choice between (1) and (3) depends on which argument is the
topic. (2) is used instead of (1) when A provides given information. The 0 NP, or the
A NP in ergative case, can be placed after the verb, when they provide new information
in the discourse. 15
     In addition to core arguments, many transitive verbs can take NPs in absolutive case,
verbal nouns, verbal clauses with verbs in Definite Future TAM, or sentences in
quotation, as Complements. Examples of absolutive NPs functioning as the Comple-
ments of transitive verbs are given below (see §14.3.2.1, §14.5 and §14.6 for the
examples of different types of Complements):3-65          hoo          impa             Keehno              tang-a-'-ko-ng.

              [ 0]                 c ]
              'Now people call them Keehno tribe.' (XI-30, cf. 14-39)3-66                 hoo       ko'sa            tii        Koimeke      nep-ee-wa-ro ...

              '... after they took the shell from Koimeke, (they) .. .' (VIII-34)
     Note that the verb stem nep-ee- in 3-66 is derived by the applicative suffix -(j)ee. It
introduces a new 0 argument (Koimeke) and moves the original 0 (hoo ko'sa) into
Complement status. (See also 3-24. See Ch 14 for a detailed discussion of valency-
changing processes.)
14   Unless another absolutive NP denoting location precedes and functions as a topic. e.g. 3-15.
15 The definitions of ""new"" and ""given"" information are according to Chafe (1976). See also fn 3 in§6.2.6. In Motuna, elements which provide given information are generally placed at the beginning,
while those which provide new information are placed at the end. This rule applies both at phrase and
clause levels. cf. Ch 10.

  Intransitive verbal clauses require only one core NP in absolutive case (S).
  Predicate verb phrases in intransitive verbal clauses typically express intransitive
actions, existence, possession, changes of state, processes, or inner experiences.
Thus, semantically, S could be the Agent, the Experiencer, the Theme, or the Patient.3-67      roo                 pee              tii        Maawo       poko-no.

  Absolutive or similative NPs, APs, PartPs, verbal nouns, Definite Future verbal
clauses, or sentences in quotation, can function as the Complements of certain intransi-
tive verbal clauses. (cf. 3-8, 3-21 and 3-60. See also §14.3.1 and §14.3.2.2.)3-71      ong               noo             toko=tokoh-ah             tu-ro-ng?

     A nominal clause consists of two noun phrases, which function as the argument and
the predicate in this order. 16
     The argument NP is always in absolutive case, and the predicate NP is either in
absolutive case, or a Possessor or a local noun with a gender suffix. Predicate NPs are
usually without determiner. 17
     Semantically, nominal clauses can be classified into (1) ""equational"", (2) ""posses-
sive"" and (3) ""local"" clauses. Nominal clauses with verbal nouns as predicates are
discussed separately inCh 16.","[89, 90, 91, 92]"

1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY AND LANGUAGE DATA    This grammar of Motuna is based on narrative texts, most of which were provided
by two main female informants, Dora Leslie from Kaakotokori village, and Therese
Minitong Kemelfield from Panakee village. They are native speakers of the standard7 Basic voice distinction may well be a typological feature common to most Non-Austronesian
languages in Bougainville. It is attested in Nasioi (middle voice corresponds to ""reflexive"" in Hurd and
Hurd 1966, 1970), in Nagovisi (middle voice corresponds to ""reflexive"" in Hunt and Hunt 1973) and in
Konua (middle voice corresponds to ""passive and reflexive"" in MUller 1954). The existence o~distinct
""reflexive"" category in Buin verbs is also suggested in Wurm (1975: 794).
6                                                                                Chapter 1Motuna. Both ofthem are in their forties. They speak English and Tok Pisin fluently,
and apart from these languages, Dora speaks her father's language Roviana (Austrone-
sian) in the Solomon Islands, and Therese her first husband's language Tinputz
(Austronesian) in Bougainville. They also speak neighbouring Non-Austronesian
languages such as Nagovisi and Buin to some extent.
    There are other texts by two elderly speakers, Sirou Korikee (female) and Puuwa
Paurarai (male) from Haarii village, which were recorded by Therese when she was
herself collecting narratives and accounts of Siwai tradition from old people.
    In all, my main corpus consists of twenty-three texts, in total duration of 138
minutes. As mentioned in § 1.2, there is very little dialectal variation among these
texts. The texts (I), (VIII) and (XVII) are given in Appendix for illustration. This
grammar is inductively formulated by examining the language data in these texts.
    In addition, I use three texts of the Pouko dialect obtained from Agnes Kennedy (in
her thirties) for supplement. The reason why I did not use these texts in the same way
as the main texts mentioned above is that the Pouko dialect is quite distinct from other
dialects (cf. §1.2). The former are also characterised by many more loanwords and
incomplete sentences than the latter.
    There are four more recorded
                           .
                                 texts.
                                    .
                                        Two of them are recorded from the telephone
conversation of Therese with another Motuna speaker. One is a free conversation
between Therese and her three daughters. And the last one is a personal history told by
a male speaker, Alex Dawuia (in his forties), from Mamangota village. All these texts
are characterised by loanwords from English and Tok Pisin, and loose conversational
style with lots of incomplete sentences. Sentences and vocabulary (especially loan-
words) found in these texts are occasionally used to illustrate particular aspects of the
grammar.
    Four short conversational texts, and a collection of 166 short sentences, written by
Dora Leslie, are also used to illustrate some grammatical points.
    All the examples cited from the above-mentioned data are identified at the end of
English translation in brackets. For example, (XI-13) indicates that it is taken from the
thirteenth sentence of the text (XI). If there is no number in brackets, the given
example is from elicitation. All the elicited examples were checked carefully by the two
main informants. Gaps in some areas of grammar --- especially in the paradigms of
nouns, classifiers and verbs --- are checked through elicitation. They were also
checked carefully by my two main informants.
    The main aim of this grammar is to present major characteristics of this language for
language typologists and linguists in general. It is not exhaustive, but it covers all the
grammatical aspects found in the narrative texts mentioned above. I give examples
quite generously whenever I discuss important grammatical P?ints. Sometimes the
Introduction                                                                                  7same examples are used in different chapters. Wherever it is relevant, the use of the
same example in different chapters is referred to in the text or in brackets after the data
identification number.
  Some aspects of the grammar --- such as the paradigms of numeral classifiers, the
use of the agentless passive construction --- are incomplete. These areas of grammar,
as well as detailed analysis of complex sentences and discourse organisation, investiga-
tion for sociolinguistic variation and genetic relationship with neighbouring languages,
are left for further research.

processes except for Rule 13-16 (i.e. the last consonant /C/ is simply dropped before
1-rnl or 1-rl). All the stems of this type I have attested are given below:

The paradigms of verbs in Motuna are described according to this classification.
  Verbs take TAM suffixes listed in Table 12-3a- c after cross-referencing mor-
phemes. In addition, the negative infix /-woo-/ can be placed between cross-
referencing markings and the Imaginative, General DS, Continuous SS or DS medial
suffix. TAM suffixes may be followed by gender suffixes in the case of fully inflected
non-medial verbs, or may be fused with a switch-reference marking in the case of
medial verbs. Schematically,

The Noun Phrase                                                                          219            CHAPTER 10 THE NOUN PHRASE
10.1 THE HEAD OF THE NOUN PHRASE  In Motuna, nouns, pronouns, the article, the demonstrative, numerals and som~
classifier constructions can stand as the heads of noun phrases. Examples (NP heads
are underlined):
the common noun kupuna 'ancestor spirit' as head:10-1       ong           kupuna         o-wori               hoo      naa'ru.

  Motuna extensively uses headless noun phrases. Any attributes, including adjec-
tives, classifier constructions, the 'all' quantifier, possessors, relative clauses, etc. can
be employed in such NPs. See corresponding chapters.
  Two or more nouns can be coordinated at nuclear level, either by the conjunction jii,
or by the suffix -nno. cf. §9.4.1 and §9.4.2.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"
"2.2.2      Fricatives
  The fricative /s/ [s] occurs in word initial or medial position before a vowel, but
cannot occur word-finally or before a consonant, except in loanwords such as kalabuus
'prison' (from kalabus in Tok Pisin), stoa 'store' (from English or Tok Pisin). e.g. saa
'side', siro 'song', harusu 'female turtle', musi'ka 'pain'.
· Distributionally, the occurrence of /s/ is restricted. In the majority of indigenous
words which contain /s/, /s/ is followed by /i/. A sequence of /s/ and /il in a loanword
corresponds to an alveolar or a postalveolar fricative or affricate in the original word.
For example,
    sikuuna [stku:na]                            'schooner' (English or Tok Pisin)
    raisi [ratst]                                'rice' (English or Tok Pisin)
    siipi [si:pt]                                'ship' (English or Tok Pisin)
    sengsi [sest] - senisi [sentst]              'change' (English) - 'senis' (Tok Pisin)
Sometimes an affricate [tJ] or [d3] in the original word is retained. e.g. Dachi [datJt]
'Holland', tiicha [ti:tJa]- tiisia [ti:stja] 'teacher', Siapani [stapant]- Japani [d3apam]
'Japan/Japanese'.",[42]

(1) A and 0 (active) correspc ·nd to S (middle) [reflexive action]
     The reflexive action described in middle voice may be a voluntary or involuntary
action, or a habitual activity involving oneself, 23 which directs towards oneself or
one's bodypart. Examples:/mono-/ 'to see/look at sb/sth' (active), 'to see/look at oneself (middle):12-24a       ho-ko              hiuo         mono-ii- '-hee.

23 The verbs which denote 'groomi.n g', such as /uuh-/ 'to wach oneself and /sii'h-/ 'to put oil on
oneself, can be interpreted this way. The meanings expressed by these verbs are characterised more as
'activities involving oneself than as 'punctual reflexive actions', and thus are close to the semantic
content expressed by the type (3) stems below.
270                                                                                            Chapter 12other examples (see also 12-14a, band e):

                                            'to lie down/be lying' (middle)
(2) 0 (active) corresponds to S (middle) [autonomous process/event]
     The verb in middle voice expresses an autonomous process or event. The subject
(S) undergoes the effects of the whole process/event. Examples:/pokuk-/ 'to hide sb/sth' (active), 'to be hidden' (middle):12-27       tii       poku'-ro                    manni ti-ki               po'k-oi-juu ...

Other examples (see also 12-14d and e):

            Ito-/                           'to hit/kill sb/sth' (active)
                                            'to hit oneself (against sth)' 24 (middle)24 This is not a reflexive action, since the event described by this verb form is always caused by an
external agent or controller. S often refers to an inanimate object (such as ""a tree which was cut
down"") or an animate entity without any scope of control (such as ""a baby"").
Preview of Verbs                                                                                      271(3) A (active) corresponds to S (middle) [activity in which one is involved]
     The subject of the verb, both in active and middle voices, is the controller of the
described action or activity. The verb in active voice expresses a transitive action which
the Agent (A) performs towards the Patient (0), while the verb in middle voice ex-
presses the Agent's (S) activity in which the Patient is irrelevant or unspecified. In the
latter case, the verb may take an absolutive noun phrase as a Complement, which refers
to a non-specific or habitual event or activity (as in 12-31b). Examples:/taapu-/ 'to help sb' (active), 'to participate' (middle):12-30a       jeewo?      ni-ngi       noo           taavu-r-ong-kuu-ng?

                                            'to play/dance' (middle)
25 Note that in 12-3la the 0 NP of komik- in active voice, ong siimpai, refers to a specific event,
while in 12-3lb the Complement of komik- in middle voice, sikuulu 'schooling', refers to a non-
specific event.

     Middle-only verb stems are classified into the following three subtypes (1)'- (3)',
the semantic content of which is si;milar to that of (1)- (3), respectively, in§ 12.3.3.1:
(1)' [physical action which crucially involves one's body]
     The denoted action may be voluntary or involuntary. Examples:lkuror-/ 'to run/be at a run':12-33        nampa            kuro-roo.
             quickly          run-MID.2S.IMP
             'Run quickly.' (V -45)

             'And then, while sitting there, he said to the centepede: ""... ""' (VII-39)
Other examples:
12-35        /miHw-/                         'to move/jump vigorously'
             /turu-/                         'to return'
             */suQk-/                        'to jump'
             *lkakapi-/                      'to crawl like a caterpillar'
The verbs marked by * have transitive counterparts with causative meanings, which do
not seem to be used very often.26
     Note that /neQw-/ with middle suffixes (12-34) and /maap-/ with active (SA) suffixes
have exactly the same meaning. Similarly, /morik-/ 'to return' with active (SA) suffixes
seems to be the synonym of /turu-/ with middle suffixes ( 12-35). Which of the two
synonymous verbs in these pairs is used in a particular context largely depends on
social factors. In general, the words, whose initial syllables are identical with those of
tabooed names, are avoided. This is probably one of the major reasons why Motuna
has many pairs of synonymous words.","[298, 299, 300, 301]"
"     Stress is predictable, and thus is not phonemic in Motuna. 21
(1) Most words 22 consisting of three or more moras are pronounced with a relatively
level high pitch from the beginning till the third mora from the last, which is im-
mediately followed by another mora showing significantly steep drop in pitch. The F0
extract of arapah 'bad' in Figure 2-7 illustrates this. 23 The F 0 of the first two syllables
is almost level. The F0 of the second a before the closure of pis 240Hz, while the F0
of a in the penultimate pa at the onset is 202 Hz.

21   Certain interjections deviate from the generalisations below. cf. §2.8.
22 Some words which end with a C preceded by two identical vowels seem to have a stress on the
                                   2
fourth mora from the last. e.g. puuwootawah 'killed (participle)', puuwootoong 'he killed him' (but:
puuwootawdang 'they killed him', puuwootdwaro'after they kill him'). I have no explanation for these
exceptions.
23 The following figures were made on the Signalize (version 2.8). In the case of Figure 2-7-2-15,
the same word or sentence was repeated three times by the same female speaker and was recorded on a
Nakamichi 550 cassette deck. In each case, the second of the three tokens was taken. The last example
given in Figure 2-16 is taken from a recorded text narrated by another female speaker.
   Each figure consists of a waveform, an F 0 extract and a half wideband spectrogram. Vertical lines
are drawn to show the segmentation. Each segment is alligned with its phonemic transcription given
underneath. (/roo/ 'you sg' in Figures 2-12 and 2-14- 2-16 are written as ""doo"" .)

shows a phase of level or slightly rising high pitch immediately followed by a steep
drop in pitch, and the last mora shows either a continuous drop in pitch or a relatively
level low pitch. The F 0 extract of ramo 'back' in Figure 2-8 and that of ruu 'day' in
Figure 2-9 in page 25 show this.
 In Figure 2-8, o of the initial ro shows a rising, and then a level phase in F 0 , which is
followed by the continuous falling in F 0 of mo. In Figure 2-9, the first half of the
utterance ruu shows a slight rising, and the second half shows a continuous falling in
F 0 which is slowed down at the end. 24
   I will call the third mora from the last in the case of words consisting of three or
more moras (as the second a in arapah), and the first mora in the case of words consist-
ing of two moras (as the first o in r6mo and the first u in rnu), ""stressed moras"",
provided that they are voiced.","[53, 54, 55]"

    There is another dialect or language called Baitsi spoken in further west, around
Boku (cf. Map). Allen and Hurd (1965) refer to it as a sublanguage of ""Siwai Proper
Dialect"". However, I have no data ofthis variety.
    This thesis is based on the data provided by four informants from the central regions
of Siwai (cf. § 1.5). The data of the Pouko dialect will be mentioned wherever relevant,
but the full analysis of this dialect is left for future research.
Introduction                                                                                         31.3 PREVIOUS WORK
    The Roman Catholic and the Methodist missions started to work in the Siwai region
early in this century. Some of the missionaries studied Motuna and attempted to
translate biblical texts into Motuna. According to Allen and Hurd (1965), Rev. A. H.
Voyce, Fr. Schlieker and Pamela Beaumont translated some biblical texts and hymns.
Fr. Schlieker also worked on a elementary grammar, and Pamela Beaumont on a
dictionary. 3
                                                                                             l,
    Tn.,.dditi\JV\""lo the work done by the missionaries, American anthropologist Douglas
Oliver (1949, 1955) describes the Siwai life and culture with rich linguistic information
based on the data collected in his first field work in 1938-39. Although he is not a
professional linguist, his phonemic transcription is fairly accurate, and the linguistic
data he provides is invaluable.
    Linguists belonging to the Summer Institute of Linguistics conducted field work on
the languages in Bougainville including Motuna. Among them, Allen and Hurd
( 1965), as mentioned above, did lexico-statical survey of all the languages in Bougain-
ville including Motuna. Gasaway ( 1987) provides lexical data of the dialects of Motuna
and Nagovisi based on her field work. She also puts forward phonological analysis of
these data.","[31, 32]"

Another example of the existential verb tu( h)-:14-33           hoo          ree-mo                   noo          tu-ro-ng?

                'Is there possibly your husband (lit. your father~ ?' (XV -2)
As in 14-33, the Perfect form of tu(h)- expresses present existence. In a negative
sentence, when the Complement is followed by the negative particle toku and the
numeral noi 'alone/any' (cf. §8.2.2.1.1), the presence of the Perfect form of the verb
tu(h)- is optional (cf. 14-106).14-34           kuu-ngi            tuu       toku     noi        (tu-ro-ng).

This suffix is susceptible to Rules 13-2 and 13-6. cf. fn 1.
Verbal Morphology                                                                                    321     The singular suffixes 1-moro/, 1-roro/ and /-woro/ are fused in various ways with the
following TAM suffixes. Those changes are summarised in §13.2.4.15.
     I found three verbs which take the 2nd person suffix beginning with In/ instead of
/r/, i.e. /noro/- /nee-til- /nee-ru/. They are: /sih-/ 'to be quiet', /tung-/ 'to enter', and
/ruh-/ 'to come out' .13

TAM suffixes listed in Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/femi-
                                                                                               'iJ

"
     In the rest of the stems ending with a C2 C sequence, C2 consonants alternate with Ci
or Cu syllables. The form with Ci or Cu occurs only when the last consonant, in
combination with the 3rd person A suffix 1-u/, is dearticulated due to Rule 13-21
below. 27 For example,13-35        pa'r-u-hee                                   'he/she will definitely shake it'
             shake-30.3A-DEFFUT
             paki'-hee                                    'idem'
             shake.30.3A-DEFFUT
In 13-35, the transitive verb stem with a 3rd singular 0 and A pa'r-u alternates with the
form paki'. The glottal stop of paki' is the realisation of /Q/ formed due to an optional
dearticulation of the stem-final consonant /r-1 and the 3rd A suffix 1-u/. However, the
alternation of the glottal stop in the stem pa 'r- and ki in the form paki' cannot be
explained unless we posit the underlying form /pakir-/ for this verb stem. The lkil in
the stem is dearticulated to /Q/ when followed by a CV syllable?8
     For this reason, I posit underlying forms in the shape of /CiC-/ or /CuC-1 for all the
verb stems which show similar alternations. They are listed below:(1) stems which have /Q/ in C2 position. The underlying form of this archi-stop may be
lki/, /ku/, or ltul.(i) stems ending with lkiC-/:
       underlying form            commonly realised as           gloss
       /hahakij-/ -/hahakuj-/ haha'j-                            'to work on' (transitive)27 Rule 13-21 consists of different sets of rules from Rule 13-20, although there are some similarities
between them. Rules 13-21 and 13-22 apply only to the stems listed below in this section, while Rule
13-20 applies only to the stems listed in §13.4.2.3.
28 We cannot posit /paQr-/ as the underlying form, because we cannot predict which of the CV
syllables (ki, ku or tu) a glottal stop in the stem alternates with. The dearticulation of /lci/, lku/ and
/tu/ to Q is phonologically motivated, but not vice versa.

         The /ki/, /ku/ and ltu/ sequences of the stems of this class are dearticulated to IQI due
       to Rule 13-22a, when followed by a CV syllable. The stem-final C, when combined

14.1     INTRODUCTION  As discussed in Chs 12 and 13, verb stems in Motuna can take one or more of tp.e
five types of cross-referencing marking (0/A, S0 , SA and irregular markings in active
voice, and middle suffixes in middle voice). Verb forms, in tum, may take:
(1) core noun phrases, which are obligatorily cross-referenced,
(2) Complements, which are not cross-referenced but are nevertheless syntactically
       obligatory, and
(3) peripheral arguments, which are syntactically optional.","[413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426]"
"
  Imperative forms are again irregular. When S0 sterns are followed by a 3rd person
singular S0 suffix /-u/ and the Imperative suffix 1-o/, 1-u/ is either regressively or
progressively assimilated; in the former case the glide w is inserted before -o-o (cf.
§ 13.4.2.1.1):13-17a      musi'ka-a-wo- musi'ka-wo-o               'let him feel pain'
            feel.pain-3S-IMP
       b    siiho-o-wo- siiho-wo-o                   'let him become ill'
            become.ill-3S-IMP
  In the case of transitive verbs, the glide j is inserted before -ee (Imperative with 3rd
singular 0 and 2nd singular A). The combination of 3rd singular 0 and A, 1-u/, is
assimilated to the preceding stem-final vowel when followed by the Imperative suffix
1-o/, and then the Imperative suffix is realised as -wo except after u:

           help-30o3A-IMP
  Note that Rule 2-9 applies after the above rules, so that the vowel /o/ in the stem may
be assimilated to a or e of the following suffix:
/ngo-/ 'to do/make' (transitive):
13-20a      ngo-jee/nge-jee                         'you (sg) do it'
            do-30o2A.IMP      b    nga-wa-ki-ng                             'they more than two used to do it'
           do-30o3pcl,A-HABPAST-M
/miNno-/ 'to follow' (transitive):
13-21a    minno-jee/minne-jee                       'you (sg) follow him/her/it'

The transitive verb /to-/ 'to hit/kill' is the only exception for (Rule 13-19b)o The stem is
realised as tu instead of to when followed by /-u/, as in 13-22c and d:13-22a     to-jee/ te-jee           'you (sg) hit him/her'

13.4.2.3      Stems Ending with a Single Consonant
     Examples of underlying forms of SJS itransitive stems, ending with a single
consonant, are given below.(1) stems ending with lk-P3:
       /hunok-/ 'to become/be full in stomach', lkipiQtak-/ 'to hiccup', /topukuk-/ 'to
       become/be wet and cold' (S 0 )
       /haarok-/ 'to fall', /hoNnak-/ 'to grow up', linginak-/ 'to rain', /kuuk-/ 'to (get to)
       know', /nok-/ 'to say', /patak-/ 'to arrive', /poNnaak-/ 'to become many', etc.(SA)
       /inak-/ 'to look after/be with', lkomik-/ 'to finish', /nauk-/ 'to lay down', /pataak-/
       'to pull/lead', /piruk-/ 'to tum over', /ratik-/ 'to find', etc. (transitive)(2) stems ending with /t-/:
      lkinot-/ 'to become/be drowned' (S 0 )
      /aat-/ 'to sleep/stay overnight', /it-/ 'to stand up/be standing', /maarit-/ 'to rest',
      /riit-/ 'to take long time', etc. (SA)
      /haapot-/ 'to find difficult', lhuhut-/ 'to deceive', /miit-/ 'to squeeze (sago)',
      /nopot-/ 'to bum', /ririt-/ 'to tear', /rokut-/ 'to bury', etc. (transitive)(3) stems ending with /p-/:
      /maap-/ 'to sit down/be sitting' (SA)
      lhuup-/ 'to blow', /nop-/ 'to take', /raup-/ 'to pull out', /tunup-/ 'to clear (the way)'
       (transitive)(4) stems ending with /n-/:
      /asariin-/ 'to swim', lkiin-/ 'to climb', lmon-1 'to look', /sukon-/ 'to walk limping'
       (SA)
23 The stem-final/k/ of some SA stems may surface as ng, especially after a nasal. e.g. honnang- 'to
grow up', ponnaang- 'to become many', inginang- 'to rain'. They are distinguished from the stems
which have underlying /ng/ endings with respect to their morphophonemic behaviour when followed by
a 3rd person suffix 1-u/. That is, those ending with lkJ are sensitive to Rule 13-2la, while those
ending with /ng/ are sensitive to Rule 13-21b. See also §12.4.1.
Verbal Morphology                                                                                      379(5) stems ending with /ng-/:
       /iirong-/ 'to be angry', /eQseheng-/ 'to sneeze' (SA)
       lhaarung-/ 'to feel pity on', lhonung-/ 'to feel by touch', /kung-/ 'to bring/take to
       one's place', /noong-/ 'to gather', /rorong-/ 'to tell', /tong-/ 'to call/name', etc.
       (transitive)
       /aaring-/ 'to go inside' (SA), 'to go over' (transitive)(6) stems ending with lh-/:
       /kaah-/ 'to disagree/not to want', /mutih-/ 'to become/be/feel sweet/tasty', /ooiuh-/
       'to become/be afraid', /piih-/ '(one's tears/blood) to drip', etc. (S 0 )
       /korih-/ 'to bear plenty of fruits', /kuuh-/ 'to bend down', /ruma=ruuh-/ 'to come
       back to life' (SA)
       lhaah-/ 'to throw away', /noh-/ 'to say to', /onoh-/ 'to decide', /ronguh-/ 'to end',
       /sih-/ 'to leave', /uuh-/ 'to wash', etc. (transitive)
       /toko=tokoh-/ 'to become/be/feel hot' (S 0 ), /tokoh-/ to heat' (transitive)
       /urisih-/ 'to leave (a place)' (Sitransitive)(7) stems ending with /r-/:
      _lhukar-/ 'to arrive', /kor-/ 'to say', /kumar-/ 'to laugh', /okur-/ 'to get/be tired',
       /omor-/ 'to escape', /ur-/ 'to go first', etc. (SA)
       /arar-/ 'to serve', /hurir-/ 'to blow', /kehur-/ 'to draw/write', /pongir-/ 'to break',
       /sir-/ 'to put', /tokur-/ 'to pull out (taro)', etc. (transitive)(8) stems ending with /s-/:
       /kais-/ 'to cling to', /tokis-/ 'to cut' (transitive)
     They all undergo the stem-final consonant rule (Rule 13-16). That is, when they are
followed by a 1st person 0 suffix 1-ml or a 2nd person 0 suffix /-r/, the stem-final
consonants are dropped. In addition, when the 1st or 2nd person 0 suffix is followed
by a 3rd person A suffix 1-u/, Rule 13-17 applies.
     When a stem-final consonant is followed by a 3rd A suffix 1-u/, they may be deart-
iculated as follows: 24
24 /kaah-/ 'to disagree/not to want' (SJ (§ 13.2.1) and /mon-/ 'to look' (SA) (§ 13.2.2) are not suscepti-
ble to Rule 13-20.

(3)' [complex activity in which one is involved]
  The majority of stems in this subclass are derived from nouns which denote complex
activities. Original nouns include loan words from English or Tok Pisin such as
sikuulu(-) 'school(ing)/to be educated' and kiki- 'to play soccer' (cf. 12.4.3), and
nouns with the derivational suffix -ai such as tupur-ai 'burning off of the bush' and
siimp-ai 'sweeping' (cf. § 12.4.1 ).
  The subject of the verb is involved in the described activity as an Agent, but there is
no specifiable Patient. Examples:/sikuulu-/ 'to be educated':12-39      tiko         ti-ki       aat-o-mo                       sikuulu-moro-ki-na.

10.3.4.2     No i 'a/one/some/any'
  As mentioned in §8.2.2.1.1, the preferred position of the numeral noi
'alone/some/any', as an attribute, is after the head, usually among adjectives (10-69-
10-71) and before relative clauses (10-74).10-69      ... hia        noi        mirahu         ngo-opee ...

second operation 'all' the internal parts (affected by cancer) were taken out.10-76a      harak-a-ro-ko                                  toku    nah-a-a-na:

10.3.4.4    Possessors and Local Attributive Nouns with Gender Suffixes
  Possessors and local attributive nouns with gender suffixes (cf. § 11.2.3) are usually
placed in pre-head positions. But unlike other modifiers which are almost strictly
pre-head, they can be placed in post-head positions, emphasising new information.
  For example, the following sentence describes that the ""rotting juices"", made from
Maawo the Snake's decayed tail, were unexpectedly found by his children. The
Possessor NP Maawo poko-ng 'Maawo's' follows the head hing 'rotting juices',
giving new information:10-77a     impa       ru'kahw-ee-ijo                                  hoo         hing

Two sentences later the Possessor refers to already given information; this time it is
placed in pre-head position.10-77b     ong           nee              nuri        Maawo           voko-ng            hing

    Medial verbal clauses often stand as separate sentences. 4 In some cases, the
controlling clause of such a medial clause exists in, or is easily recovered from, the
preceding or following sentence. For example,17-13         ongi              mono-ji-rii-juu.                    nii    mi-ko-ng.

              babies with me (and go)?' (XVI-26- 27)
In 17-13, the marked clause is immediately followed by the controlling clause nii
mi-ko-ng, which constitutes a separate sentence. 5 In 17-14, the unexpressed control-
ling clause of uko-opito, shown in the brackets, is easily recovered from the previous
sentence.
    However, there are cases where no obvious controlling clause exists or can be
recovered, and the theme of the discourse must be understood from the speech situa-
                           \
tion. Observe the fo~wing sentence:
4   See fn 1 for the criteria of determining sentence boundaries.
5   The end of the first clause is marked by a natural falling pitch followed by a significant pause.

            and was somewhere(= was not at home).' (XV-63, cf. 14-30a)
In 17-15, the dependent embedded clause tii haapi'-ku sets up the temporal framework
for the whole sentence. The perfect SS form pi-ro is controlled by tuujuu. The DS
marking of tuu-juu indicates that the state of the S referent of this verb 'our papa' is
contrasted with the main theme of the discourse, i.e. ""our (the narrator and her chil-
dren) waiting at home"", which is understood from the context.17-16       aat-opi-h                            piru=piruk-oro-mo                     toku-ko      tapa.

            turned herself over all the time uncomfortably.' (XV-60, cf. 14-58)
In 17-16, the overlapping referents of the twoS arguments, i.e. ""we two (the narrator
and her daughter)"" of aat-opih and ""she (the narrator's daughter)"" of piruk-oro-mo, are
parts of the thematic framework of the whole discourse. Thus both of them are marked
by the SS suffixes.
  The Continuous SS and DS forms, without explicit controlling clauses, are often
used to express the speaker's assertion that such states/durative events should continue
(see also 17-13):17-17       .. . roo             toku           tiwo         konn-i-i.

  In the following sections, I will overview the chaining of medial clauses (§17.2),
and relative clauses (§17.3), with examples from my corpus. Detailed study of
complex sentences, especially that of the discourse structure of clause chaining, is left
for further research.","[536, 537]"

13.2.2.15 Realisation of 1st Person A Suffix
  The realisation of the 1st person A suffix is as follows:
      Rule 13-12      Realisation of 1st Person A Suffix
            The following rules apply before Rules 13-1- 13-5.
            The 1st person A suffix, in singular, is combined with the following TAM
             suffixes to take various forms:             (a) {1st A} -m -> -o-m
             (b) {1st A} -k -> -ong
            (c) {1st A} -w, -h -> -op
            (d) {1st A} -r -> -oNn
            (e) {1st A} -i -> -os-i
            (f) {1st A} -juu -> -osuu
            (g) {1st A} -u -> -ot-u
            (h) {1st A} -o -> -om-o
            It is realised as /-opi/ before the dual suffix /-til:            (i) {1st A} -> -opi I_ -ti
            In paucal/plural number, it, again, takes various forms. It fuses with the /r/
            of the Perfect and Negative Optative suffixes, and /w/ of the Optative suffix
            and the negative infix. It is realised as -opi word-finally, as -opi-r10 before
            a vowel, and -oN in other environments.","[334, 335]"

2.3 VOWELS     Motuna has a typical five vowel system.
   Among the vowels, lol is most susceptible to the influence of adjacent vowels, and
Ia! most stable (cf. §2.7.1, §4.4.4 and Ch 13). The vowel lol is also by far the most
commonly used among the five vowels. In three texts (1, VI, and XXIII), chosen at
random, by three different speakers, lol accounts for 34%, while Iii, Ia!, lui and lei
account for 24%, 18%, 17%, and 7% respectively.
  Motuna has many types of vowel sequences, including two identical vowels in
succession. In any vowel sequence, each member behaves independently from other
members as far as stress and prefixing reduplication are concerned (cf. §2.4.2).
Therefore, there seems to be no motivation to assume that Motuna has phonernically
any long vowels or diphthongs.
  Single vowels and sequences of two identical vowels 15 show surface contrasts in all
environments except in open disyllabic words. Motuna has no open monosyllabic15 Oliver ( 1955) does not distinguish between single short vowels and sequences of two short vowels.

       bo'l'\'f'\.e&   V-       turong                'you (masculine) are, he/it is'
       tuurong               'he/she hit him'
       narang                'ten'
       naraang               'one limb'
       pih                   'bamboo container, you/they (two) have already gone'
       piih                  'canarium almond'
       pana                  'his wife'
       panaa                 'ancestress'
but:
       mii                   'name, knee, I have already gone'
       (*mi)
       nee                   'O.K.?, we (inclusive)'
       (*ne)
  There are, however, reasons to assume that sequences of two identical vowels in
some open disyllabic words underlyingly constitute just single vowels.
  In Motuna, the article and most personal pronouns have CVV forms when they are in
absolutive case. However, when they take the ergative suffix /-ki/, some of them retain
the original two identical vowels, while others take single ones. For example,
                             in absolutive case        in ergative case
       I   I   I
                                nu                       m-ngl
       'we (inc)'               nee                      nee-ki
       'you (sg)'               roo                      ro-ki
       'you (nonsg)'            ree                      ree-ki
       'who'                    jXl£l                    pa-i
       'ART (M)'                hoo- sao                 ho-i- so-i
       'ART (F/DIM/DP)'         tii                      tii-ngi
       'ART (L)'                tii                      ti-ki
  The last two examples are particularly interesting. The article in feminine, dimunitive
or dual-paucal gender has the same form as that in local gender, in absolutive case.
However, their forms are different in ergative case.
  In the above cases, morphological analysis will be simpler if we assume that the
difference of surface vowel length in ergative case comes from that of the underlying

     The following phonological rule forces the underlying vowels of open mono-syllabic
words to surface as a sequence of two identical vowels:
       Rule 2-7               Vowel Lengthening of Underlying Open Mono-syllabic Words
                       vi -> vyi 1 #(C) _ #     In addition to sequences of two identical vowels mentioned above, Motuna allows
many types of sequences of two or more vowels. All the combinations attested so far
are given below:
1) Sequences of two vowels (include all the sequences which end with /if, lui and /a/):
                       /ail, /ui/, /ei/, /oil
                       /au/, !iu/, /eu/, lou/
                       lial, !ual, leal, loaf
                       /io/
16   There are other pieces of evidence which support this assumption:
( 1) all singular personal pronouns, in their bound forms, take short vowels, while nonsingular
pronouns take long vowels. This applies to possessive and reflexive pronouns as well. cf. Tables 4-7,
5-3 and 5-4.
(2) When the emphatic suffix /-ko/ is attached, only the vowel of the masculine form of the article, hoo
-sao, can optionally be shortened (cf. §9.3).
  As regards other mono-syllabic words with long vowels, there are no reason to assume that they
have different underlying forms, since the forms with short vowels never occur. They include:
                    maa 'faeces', haa 'thing, I wonder', mii 'name, knee, before I have gone',jii 'and', tuu
                    'water', kuu 'inside', nee 'O.K.?', noo 'possibly'

    verbal forms, but others are found only in a few words):
           /aai/, /uuil, /eei/, /ooi/
           /aau/, liau/
           /aia/, /uia/, /eua/

           /aauu/, /eeuu/
           /uiaa/
           /aioo/

     C 1 can be any consonant except /HI, /Q/ and IN/. C 2 can be either /HI, /Q/ or IN/.
As we have seen in §2.3, all vowel sequences are analysed as sequences of single
vowels, which constitute the nuclei of separate syllables.
     C 2 consonants are not followed by a vowel. 17 Now, the underlying forms of some
suffixes may have an archinasal at the beginning. 1 8 When such a suffix is attached to a
word ending with a C 2 , 19 C 2 must be ""articulated"" to a C 1V sequence, in order to avoid
an unperrnissible C 2 N sequence. cf. §2.7.3.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"

"3.2.2.5       Locative NPs
      Locative noun phrases are marked by the suffix -kori (or its allomorph -ngori or
-jori). We need to distinguish this case suffix from the derivational suffix -kori, which
is used to derive local nouns from the stems of non-local nouns (cf. §4.6.1 ). The
locative case suffix -kori can be attached to the article or demonstrative which deter-
mines the noun phrase. The derivational suffix -kori, on the other hand, can only be
attached to the head noun, and not to the determiner. 9 Compare:
9 In noun phrases without determiner, the distinction between the case suffix and the derivational
suffix is often not clear. The case suffix /-kori/ is obligatorily attached to the last element of an NP
without determiner. The derivational suffix /-kori/ is attached to the post-head attribute if the original
noun takes such an attribute. Thus,
(1)          poti        ponnaa-ngori                   'at many times'
              time       many-LOC?/L?can be a masculine NP in locative case or a local NP in absolutive case. It can be replaced by one of
the following NPs determined by the article:

              '... while I was going to that school, ... ' (II-17)
In 3-47, the non-local noun sikuulu is the head of a noun phrase in locative case,
which is indicated by the case suffix -jori (an allomorph of -kori) attached to the article.
(In this sentence sikuulu refers to a particular type of 'education', rather than 'school'.)
In 3-48, on the other hand, -kori is used as a derivational suffix attached to the stem of
the non-local noun sikuulu, and the derived local noun sikuulu-kori functions as the
head of an absolutive noun phrase. (Here sikuulu-kori refers to a particular 'school'.)
     A local noun derived by the suffix -kori can further be marked by a case suffix:3-49          ... ti-ki           sikuulu-kori-ki         ho-i            kaakoto-ngung

              '... the white people used to look after us in that school.' (VI-17)
     Noun phrases, with local nouns as their heads, are never in locative case.
     Locative NPs function as peripheral arguments. They roughly cover the range of
meanings expressed by absolutive, ergative and purposive NPs with local nouns as
their heads. They can, for example, refer to the locations of participants in certain
states or durative activities, 10 as in:3-50          hoo-jori        kaaposo-ngung         impa          uru-ko-ng.

suffixes listed in Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dual-
paucal gender suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. The stem-final/h-I is deleted
before a consonant due to Rule 13-16a. The combination of the stem-final/h-I and the

before the sequences of /r/ and a high vowel in Near Past and Remote Past) due to Rule
13-20d. The vowel /of of the stem is assimilated to the following a due to Rule 2-9a.

      the theme of the second DS clause is a temporary divertion from it, or

General SS and the aspectual verb tu(h)- in General DS), often constitute a close unit.
Such a unit focuses on the contrastive activities between different p~cipants. Those
participants could constitute parts of the theme of the preceding and/or following
clause( s). Even if there is referential overlap between the participants of those medial
verbs, all the verbs are consistently marked by DS suffixes.
  For example, in 17-43, the ongoing activities of ""the boy"" and ""the dwarfs"" are
contrasted by the repetition of a pair of DS medial clauses (consisting of tooh- 'to
shoot' and haarak- 'to fall', respectively, in General SS, and the aspectual verb tu(h)-
in General DS) .. The contrastive activities described by them are summarised by the
following DS medial clause tiwo nge-wee-ti-mo uru-ku.17-43       ho-i               heteeku             pit-ee- '-ku

    Apart from its normal function as a medial verb, the General DS form of rii(h)- 'to
become/be' has a special function of conjoining two independent clauses. In the latter
case, it is usually placed between two clauses (however, see 17-51 ). It expresses that
the event/fact described by the first clause is the cause of the event described by the
second clause. This medial form, in this special function, does not mark the tempo-
ral/aspectual relationship between the events described by the two clauses, nor the
switch of the themes of the two clauses.
    The following two sentences illustrate the normal and special functions of this medial
verb:
9The pause after 17-45a is much longer than the pause after the first medial clause no-ngu aarimg-a-
mo uru-ku.

             ' As I was small, I did not work.' (II-21)
   In 17-46, rii-ku (rii(h)- with a 2nd/3rd person singularS in General DS) is used as a
normal medial verb. It indicates that the event ""three month had passed"" had been
completed before the event described by the controlling clause ""he gave name to him""
took place, and that the themes of the two clauses, ""three months"" and ""he"", are
different.
  In 17-47, on the other hand, the argument of the nominal clause preceding riingu
(rii( h)- with a 1st person singular S in General DS) is the same as the S of the follow-
ing non-medial verb haha'-moro-ki-na. The medial verb riingu does not indicate any
temporal relationship, either. It only indicates that the fact described by the preceding
nominal clause is the reason why the event, ""my working"", did not take place.","[541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549]"

11Verbs in Imaginative TAM take gender suffixes in independent clauses, but do not take them in
dependent embedded clauses. Compare 12-lOj with 12-11a.
12   The realisation of the Imperative suffix is highly irregular. See Ch 13.

"12.4.1 NominalNerbal Roots
  All the roots of this type, which have been found in my corpus, are given below.
     Note that an epenthetic /k/ is attached to the roots to formall the SA verb stems and
some transitive verb stems. (The epenthetic /k/ may optionally be realised as /ng/ under
the phonological environments specified in Rule 4-1.) If the original noun ends with
IN/, /ng/ is attached, and if it ends with /HI or /Q/, /w/ is attached, to form any type of
verb root.
     These consonants do not seem to be derivational suffixes. They are needed for
phonological reasons. The epenthetic /k/27 is necessary because SA (and A) person27   Note that the back /k/ is the commonest among the stop consonants. cf. fn 12 in §2.2.3.

assimilation will occur and the person distinction of SA/A will be obscured in some
cases. A glide is needed after IN/, /HI or /Q/, because these C 2 consonants cannot be
followed directly by a vowel due to the constraint of syllable structure (cf. §2.4.1).
     These epenthetic consonants are also attached to adjectival/verbal roots. See

28 According to these criteria, if a noun corresponds to a verb stem which ends with a consonant other
than /k/, /ng/ or /w/, it is regarded as derived from the corresponding verb. e.g. hing 'rotten juices' <-
lhiNh-/ 'to decay' (So), maari 'rest, stop' <- /maarit-/ 'to rest' (SA). The root-final /ng/ after a vowel
may be underlyingly /kJ or /ng/. If it is underlyingly /ng/, again the noun is regarded as derived from
the verb. e.g. iiro 'anger' <- /iirong-/ 'to get angry' (S J. See § 13.4.2.3 for the criterion of deciding
the underlying form of a root-final consonant.

     Note that:
(1) Consonants are phonetically contrasted by five places of articulation and one place
       of coarticulation, but phonemically only by three places of articulation. The three
       archiphonemes in the fourth row, i.e. /Q/, /HI and IN/, have a special status in
       Motuna. They are the only consonants which can occupy the coda position in the
       syllable. (Syllable structure of Motuna is (C 1)V(C2 ), where C 2 is one of the three
       archiconsonants discussed here. cf. §2.4.1.) The first two archiphonemes, /Q/
       and /HI, are characterised as a voiceless stop and a voiceless fricative, respectively,
       without any oral gesture. 4 (Note that [h] before vowels, on the other hand, is a
       back phoneme /h/.) The archinasal/N/ is a nasal without any specification of place
       of articulation. It may be realised as one of the nasal phones [m], [n], [p] and [IJ]
       before certain consonants or in word-final position (cf. §2.2.3).4   cf. Lass 1984: 113-117 for a discussion of ""gesture"".
10                                                                                   Chapter 2        In general, the places of articulation of consonant phonemes are contrastive only
     before vowels.
(2) Phonetically there are voiced stops, but they are all allophones of the rhotic or glide
     phonemes.
(3) The labio-velar [kw] is an allophone of /k/ between rounded /u/ and /o/ (cf. §2.2.1).
(4) The glide [w ], the voiced fricative [!3] and the voiced stop [b] are the allophones of
     the phoneme /w/, while the glide [j], voiced dorso-palatal fricative f:H and the
     affricate [d3] are the allophones of the phoneme /j/. One of my main informants
     pronounces the voiced fricative [z] as well. Note that although /w/ and /j/ have
     fricatives, stops and an affricate as allophones, they are classified as glide pho·
     nemes due to their (morpho)phonemic behaviour (cf. §2.2.4). The phones [w]
     and [j] can also occur as phonemically non-distinct transitional phones between
     two vowels (cf. §2.3).
(5) The alveolar trill [r], flap [r], and voiced stop [d] are the allophones of the rhotic
     phoneme /r/.
(6) Phonetically we find many types of vowel sequences in Motuna. I regard all of
     them as combinations of short vowels, each of which constitutes the nucleus of a
     distinct syllable (cf.§ 2.2).
        ""Long vowels"" are regarded as sequences of two identical vowels. However,
     the high vowels /if and /u/ are phonetically more tense and closer to cardinal value
     in such sequences than when they stand alone.","[38, 39]"

15.5     ASPECTUAL VERBS     Motuna has five aspectual verbs, which are preceded by an SS medial form or a
Definite Future form. TAM inflections of these aspectual verbs are restricted in the
following way:(1) tu(h)- 'to be' expresses duration25 or habituality:
             GEN.SS/ CONT.SS + /tu(h)-/ (PRES, PRESPERF, HABPAST, FUT,
                             IMFUT, IMAG, IMP, 26 OPT, NEGOPT, GEN.SS, GEN.DS)
(2) nang- 'to be' expresses duration or habituality:
             GEN.SS + /nong-/ (FUT)25 I use the term ""durative"" to cover ""continuous"" (as regards states) and ""progressive"" (as regardsevents).
26 Note that the existential verb tu(h)- does not have Future, Imaginative and Imperative forms. cf. fn
14.
Tense/ Aspect/Mood                                                                         477(3) konn- 'to walk/move' expresses progressivity (only with action verbs and termina
           tive verbs):
           GEN.SS + lkopin-/ (PRES, PRESPROG, HABPAST, FUT, IMFUT,
                           IMAG, GEN.SS, GEN.DS, CONT.DS)
(4) pi(h)- 'to go' expresses perfectivity (only with action verbs and terminative verbs):
           PERF.SS + /pi(h)-/ (PRES)
(5) ngo- 'to do' expresses immediate future (only with action and terminative transitive
           verbs):
           DEFFUT + lngo-1 (PRES, PRESPROG, GEN.SS, GEN.DS)
  That these verbs function as operators at nuclear level (cf. Foley and Olson 1985:
33-34), and not as proper verbs which coordinate or subordinate the preceding verbs,
is demonstrated by the facts that:1) the aspectual verbs cannot take arguments of their own.
2) no morpheme can intervene between the aspectual verb and the preceding medial
    verb or verb in Definite Future. In particular, the negative particle toku cannot
    intervene between these two morphemes. In clause chaining, on the other hand,
    toku can intervene between the marked clause and the controlling clause, .and
    negate only the controlling verb.","[505, 506]"

   The temporallaspectual scope of states denoted by participles may be indicated by the
TAM forms of the Copula tu(h)- .
   Participles with tu(h)- in Present express states which are going on for a certain
(relatively long) duration of time including the speech moment:16-54      poti        ihkita         rungi        nga-wah            tu-ko-ng.

           'Is that possibly still hot?' (cf. 3-71)
  The Continuous form of tu(h)- simply expresses the continuation of a state referred
to by the participle:16-57      ... roki=manni          kirokowo          toko=tokoh-ah          tuu-juu.

           ' ... while it was still really very hot.' (XIII-34)16.3.4     Agentless Passive Construction
  Passives are formed by participles and the intransitive verb rii(h)- 'to become/be'.
Participles may be either transitive or intransitive.
  The whole construction describes a spontaneous action/event. One uses this con-
struction to avoid mentioning the central participant (the referent of S or A) of an event,
especially when such a participant is a parent/child-in-law, or a brother/sister-in-law, in
relation to the addressee, or to the speaker (if the referent of the unexpressed S/A is the
addressee). The unexpressed SorA is usually the Agent (as in 16-58 and 16-60), but
it could be the Experiencer as well (as in 16-59).

17.1     INTRODUCTION    According to the syntactic and pragmatic functions in interclausal relations, clauses in'J
Motuna are classified into independent and dependent clauses. There are two types of
dependent clauses --- those dependent at sentence level, and those dependent at supra-
sentence or discourse level. According to Foley and Van Valin's (1984: 238ff.)
terminology, I call the former ""dependent embedded"" and the latter ""dependent non-
embedded"" clauses respectively. Schematically,

                                   ""non-embedded""                       ""embedded""
    Independent clauses may stand alone as syntactically self-contained units. The
predicates of independent clauses may be verbs, nouns, or adjectives (cf. Ch 3). They
may optionally be combined with dependent clauses of either type.
    All the dependent non-embedded clauses are verbal clauses with medial verbs as their
heads. They can often stand as separate sentences, 1 but their dependency on the
discourse structure is overtly marked by switch-reference suffixes.
    Dependent embedded clauses are verbal clauses, whose heads are non-medial verbs1 The boundary between sentences is determined primarily by the existence of illocutionary force (cf.
Foley and VanValin 1984: 220-221), which is reflected in intonation patterns. In general, the end of a
declarative sentence is marked by a natural falling in pitch after the final stressed mora, with a
significant pause before another sentence starts. cf. §2.8. Sentences with verbs in Imperative, Definite
Future, and Continuous SS/DS (such as 17-1 b -c and 17-17) which express the speaker's commands or
assertions seem to be characterised by a steeper falling in pitch at the end than declarative sentences, but
this needs further investigation.
  There are cases where two or more independent clauses, with fully inflected non-medial verbs as
predicates, are uttered in one string. Unless such indepedent clauses are connected together by rii-ku (cf.
§7.2.3), I regard each clause as a separate sentence.
Interclausal Relations                                                                  503in most cases. They are subclassified into: (1) clauses filling the Complement slots of
verbal predicates, (2) adverbial clauses functioning as the peripheral arguments of
verbal predicates, (3) Possessor attributive/predicative clauses, and (4) relative clauses.
Medial verbal clauses may function as dependent embedded clauses only when they are
introduced by the conjunctions tii 'when' and tiinohno 'while, as soon as'. See 17-8
and 17-9 below.
  Verbal predicates in independent verbal clauses are always non-medial verbs.
Non-medial verbs may take one of the TAM suffixes discussed in § 15.3.1 - § 15.3.13.
They may or may not be marked by gender suffixes, depending on the types ofTAM
suffixes they take. Compare the following examples:17-1a      tii      uri       pi-heeta-na.       'You (F) will go to the village.'
           ART.L    village   go.2S-FUT-F
    b      tii      uri       pi-hee.            'You will definitely go to the village.'
           ART.L    village   go.2S-DEFFUT
    c      tii      uri       pee.               'Go to the village.'
           ART.L    village   go.2S-IMP
In 17-la, the Future form of the verb pi(h)- 'to go' is marked by the feminine suffix
-na. In 17-1 b and c, on the other hand, the verbal predicates are in Definite Future and
Imperative respectively, and they are not marked by gender suffixes.
  Note that verbs in Definite Future can be used either in independent or in dependent
embedded clauses, as discussed in § 15.3 .11. Compare the following sentence with
17-1b:17-2a      roo        hoo      ro-ong        mono-i-hee           haa-ru-i-na.

(5) The ending of the so-called emotive interjections (§9.6) is characterised by a level
high pitch. The last word of a declarative sentence may also be uttered in the same kind
of level high pitch, with a long pause after that. In Figure 2-17 in page 37, the last
word of the first sentence haarokuung is pronounced almost in a falsetto tone, after
which the speaker deliberately suspends the utterance of the following sentence (for one
and half second) to draw the attention of the addressee. The latter sentence describes an
event which is crucially related to the event described by the previous sentence. 29
29 The first sentence in Figure 2-17 describes how the heron fell into the water. The second sentencedescribes how helpless the heron was after that. The two sentences are given below:

2.9      ORTHOGRAPHY
     I follow the orthography adopted by Oliver (1955: xxii) except for /ng/, which he
transcribes as ""IJ"", and /w/, which he transcribes as ""v"".
     In the orthography in Bible translations, the Catholic missions tend to use ""j"" ,30
while the United Church ""y"", 31 for /j/. Both ""r"" and ""d"" are used for /r/. 32
     I use /j/ for the back glide because: ( 1) ""j"" seems to represent the allophonic range of
this phoneme better than ""y"" (cf. §2.2.4), and (2) ""y"" is confusingly used to represent a
non-phonemic transitional glide [j] which is heard after Iii and before a non-high vowel
(cf. Rule 2-8 in §2.3).
     On the other hand, I use the symbol /w/ for the labial glide. This symbol seems to be
well-established among native speakers, 33 although it is also confusingly used to
30
     as in So Gosipeli Maka (1952).
31
     as in So wasiih mirahu Matiu ki kehurung (1968).
32
   So wasiih mirahu Matiu ki kehurung (1968) also uses ""b"", ""j"", ""g"", ""v"" and ""1"" for loanwords
(especially in personal names or place names).
33   All my informants use ""w"" for the labial glide, while some use ""y"" and others ""j"" for the palatal
glide. Gasaway ( 1987b) reccomends ""w"" and ""y"".
38                                                                               Chapter 2represent non-phonemic [w] after /u/ and before a non-high vowel (cf. Rule 2-8 in
§2.3).
 I use only ""r"" for /r/ because [d] is clearly a free allophone of /r/ which occur in
restricted phonological environments (cf. Rule 2-6 in §2.2.5).

   Words in Motuna are classified into the following categories on morphosyntactic
criteria:
(1) Major Word Classes
      (i) Noun (cf. Ch 4)
      (ii) Adjective (cf. Ch 7)
      (iii) Verb (cf. Ch 12)
      (iv) Participle (cf. Ch 16)
(2) Minor Word Classes
      (i) Pronoun (cf. Ch 5)
      (ii) Article (cf. Ch 6)
      (iii) Demonstrative (cf. Ch 6)
      (iv) Classifier (cf. Ch 8)
      (v) Numeral (cf. Ch 8)
      (vi) Quantifier (cf. Ch 8)
      (vii) Adverb (cf. Ch 7)
      (viii) Discourse Marker (cf. Ch 9)
      (ix) Negator (cf. Ch 9)
      (x) Conjuncion (cf. Ch 9)
      (xi) Interjection (cf. Ch 9)
  Verbal nouns --- a subclass of nouns --- are discussed in Ch 16.
  The words which belong to major word classes primarily function as the heads of
phrases (noun phrases, adjective phrases, verb phrases, and participle phrases, respec-
tively). Phrases are syntactic units which constitute clauses (cf. §3.2).

or modifiers of, major syntactic units. Others carry out various syntactic and pragmatic
functions.
  Motuna is predominantly an agglutinative language. It is often the case that a word
contains one or more bound morphemes. In addition, there are various types of

bound lexical roots, which are combined with various bound morphemes and/or
words.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69]"

    The syntactic behaviour of noi is different from that of other numerals. In attribu-

modify both countable and uncountable nouns, expressing ""indefiniteness"" in general.",[208]

  The discourse marker nee 'it must be-, O.K.?' indicates that the speaker wants to
confirm that his/her information or idea is shared with the addressee. (The speaker may
address him- or herself, as in 9-7).
  The first syllable ne of nee is always pronounced with a high pitch, which is fol-
lowed by a sharp falling contour in the second syllable e. cf. §2.8.9-7        ih!        nii       nee            mara-nno            konn-opi-h=nuto-ng.

           (XI-21)9.1.5     nehe 'do you agree?'
  The discourse marker nehe is similar to nee both in meaning and syntactic behaviour.
  Nee signals that the speaker is quite sure that his/her idea is shared with the ad-
dressee, and he/she is only confirming it. In the case of nehe 'do you agree?', on the
other hand, the speaker is not so sure about it.
  As is the case with nee, the first syllable of nehe is always pronounced with a high
pitch, which is followed by a sharp falling contour in the second syllable he. cf. §2.8.9-9        ... hoo          mara           hoo-jori       ti-weena      tuh-ah   nehe

     The discourse marker ai 'I tell you' signals that the speaker is going to tell the
addressee a fact, or his/her own idea. It can be placed anywhere in a sentence, but
most frequently after the sentential topic.9-11           nii       az                rumanung-ngung-ngi                uko-m-a-a-ng.

     The interjection ai 'or' is homonynous with this discourse marker. cf. 9.5.4.9.1.7 noo 'possibly, may I ask?, take'
  The discourse marker noo 'possibly, may I ask?' is often used in interrogative
sentences (as in 9-13 and 9-14). In a sentence consisting of noo and a noun phrase, the
speaker asks the addressee to take the object referred to by the noun phrase (as in
9-15). 29-13           tiitii.         tuu         noo           no-'ra                      tuh-ee-n-na-na?

I do not know how to interpret noo in this sentence. It seems to be somehow related to the noo
discussed above, but I cannot pinpoint the common semantic component at this stage.

  The discourse marker poko 'there's no other way, had better' always occupies the
second position in a sentence. It signals that the speaker is forced to accept a certain
situation, or the necessity of a certain action. The speaker signals the end of a conver-
sation or show the agreement to the other's proposal, by using poko in set phrases with
mirahu 'good' (as in 9-16) and oso 'O.K.' (as in 9-17b).9-16       mirahu poko                           manni.          urisih-i-woro.

9.2 THE NEGATOR toku    Toku can function either as the negator of verbs, adjectives, adverbs or participles.
It is placed immediately before the element it negates. 3
as the negator of a verbal predicate:
9-23       toku     huhu-mo-i-na.
              not        be.wrong-MID.IS-NRPAST-F
              'I was not wrong.' (I-31)
as the negator of an adjectival predicate:
9-24       nii     toku naa'ru.
              I        not         lazy
              'I am not lazy.' (XIX-50)
3   Unless it is intervened by a conjunction or a discourse marker. e.g. nah-ah and roruki in 9-69b.

9-25       ... tii tii        hoo     . aanmg                 toku    mirahu      kunato-o-heeta-na.

           '... she will encouter hardships [lit. the way of life which is not good].'
           (XXI-11)
as the negator of an adverb:
9-26       tiko hoo        ruupang                     toku nampa            maapuk-u-u-ng.

           'And the bamboo container did not become full quickly.' (XI-9)
  When it is placed before a ""number one"" classifier noi or no- (cf. §8.2.2.1), it
denotes a total negation:9-27       misi-ko                                                totu '-ki-ng.

           'I am not looking at anyone.' (X-29)
  The adverbs meero 'yet' and runni 'very' always occur in negative sentences in
combination with toku:9-29       toku        meero mohkoruuk-u-i=to-ng.
           not         yet          approach-30.3A-PRESPROG-M

                 not         very      believe-30.3pcl.A-GEN.SS
           '... while they were not believing it vezy much, (they) .. .' (III-56)
   Toku can also function as a discourse marker, expressing a negative thought or
feeling of the speaker about the event described in the sentence. In such a case it is
placed at the beginning of the sentence (as in 9-31), or after a sentential topic (as in
9-32), with a discourse marker which expresses the speaker's judgement (jaa 'I
wonder' in 9-31 and 9-4, and nee 'it must be' in 9-32).9-31             toku        paa        jaa         turong-ung-heemee'ko-ng?

9.3    THE EMPHATIC SUFFIX /-ko/
  The emphatic suffix /-ko/ can be attached to any word except for interjections. It can
modify a particular word, phrase, clause or sentence. It singles out the element it is
attached to.
  When it modifies a clause or a sentence, or a conjunction or a discourse marker, it
expresses the concessive meaning 'even, if only'. It can also mark two successive
clauses or sentences, with the meaning 'A, and also B'.","[225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"
