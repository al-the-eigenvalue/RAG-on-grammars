   Note that the witnessed past tense in questions presupposed that the hearer witnessed the event
(while in non-questions it presupposes that the speaker witnessed the event).

     (0398B.1)A rhetorical yes-no question without my indicates that the hearer probably knows the identity
of the referent, and sometimes elicits a nod or affirmation from the listener. Often such a
phrase is followed by a repeat of its subject without the interrogative verb:(29)   Qouztq'a=ji   qo'   bearii     xannuu     cyn,          goura    bearii.

                                   32.1. Polar (yes-no) questions    In polar questions the verb is followed by the interrogative clitic =ii. Word order in these
questions is generally verb-second. The interrogative clitic opens the preceding syllable and
undoes present-tense vowel shortening in verbs such as {tuox} 'strike' and {d.iesh} 'read'.","[729, 730, 731, 732]"
"     32.4.2. Rhetorical questions. Rhetorical yes-no questions with emphatic my are
extremely common in Ingush discourse; see §33.2.1 for their functions and several examples.
Very often my VERB=ii functions almost as a definiteness marker or reminder of common
knowledge that explains or justifies what the speaker says.",[737]
"(96)     ""Sos"" jaaxa dosh fy      dosh dy?

interrogation is initial, and the verb follows it.",[708]

      The original quality of the vowel was *o, preserved in Batsbi and most Chechen dialects.

       'do you read?'         'did you read?'229                'you read'     In tense forms not carrying a high-tone ending, I have recorded the high tone of the
interrogative citic variously on the clitic and on the preceding syllable: {tuox=ii} 'strike?'
tuôx=ii ~ tuox=îi. On monosyllables the sole syllable includes the clitic and has high tone:
d=îi 'is?', d=ôi 'does it make? do they make?', etc.
     The answer to a yes-no question is generally just the finite verb form, optionally with any
additional words needed for expansion on the answer. The subject can be included
(postverbally, and often with slight a pause before it). Less often, the entire clause can be
repeated. The particle aa 'no' can preface one of the more elaborated replies. (Ha'a 'yes' is
not used often in answers, though it is sometimes used in affirmations (§32.6).) Emphatic
deara can be clause-initial or follow the verb. Here and below, A and B lines are the different
speakers in a dialog. (2B) shows a number of possible answers.","[732, 733]"
"Complements that are implicit polar questions in most western European languages are
explicit polar questions in Ingush, with a finite verb in the interrogative form (clitic -ii / -j; see
§30.3.2):(15)   Waishietaa shii          bierazh       kino      daxaadii  xaacar.

       Aisha didn't know whether her children went to the movies.",[566]
"     Clefting is also frequent in non-questions, where it is triggered by focus. The focused
word usually moves to the end of the clause and rest of the clause (the verb and the other
arguments) is nominalized. Less often, the focus moves to the beginning. As with questions,
in most text examples the focal word would be nominative or ergative if there were no
nominalization, but the full range of other cases and functions can be elicited. In (29)-(32)
the focused word would be nominative (subject of d.oal 'go', d.aagha 'sit', and d.y 'be', object
of dwadox(ii)t 'send flying, make go').",[652]

referent is know to be female (as in (11) and (16)).

rhetorical yes-no question (§32.4.2).
     Ergative interrogative pronouns can be elicited but are rare in natural occurrence. One of
the few idiomatic expressions with an unclefted ergative interrogative pronoun is:(20)   Hwanuo dwa-leacar       hwo?

because it already contains a nominalization (sy+bar 'mine'), and two nominalizations in one
clause would be hard to interpret.","[735, 736]"

232
     Or: ""It's called slate."" ""You know what slate is? Slanec, chernyj slanec."" As an indication
of how endangered Ingush is, in this conversation between fluent speakers explaining and defining
is done by citing a Russian word, as though they assume that the terminological and conceptual
apparatus of knowledge is associated only with Russian.

       The fact that Tieshal interacted with him shows what the personalities and concerns
       and priorities of the two of them were. ('The fact that Tieshal interacted with him, now
       that shows what …') (0380)                                        28.7. Clefting     Clefting uses a headless relative clause formed with a nominalized participle functioning
as argument or adjunct nominalization ('the one who …', 'the one that…'). Clefting is often
used in questions, where the focus of interrogation is on the interrogative word and the rest of
the clause (the predicate and its other arguments) is nominalized. It is especially frequent
when the interrogative word would be in an oblique case if clefting were not used. In texts it
occurs almost always where the questioned word would be ergative, and also frequently
where it would be nominative (subject or object). There are almost no text examples of (what
would be) oblique cases, adverbials, etc., questioned, but they could easily be elicited. In
(12)-(16) the interrogative word would be nominative if not clefted (i.e. if subject of loqar,
qeachaar, and wajiezhaar, object of lielader):(12)    Kto tut igraet? Maluu yz loqar?      eanna

take the full range of tense forms and may themselves be complex with further auxiliaries. It
seems that all possible combinations of base forms, auxiliaries, and tenses of auxiliaries
occur, and the meanings of the combinations are partly but not entirely predictable from the
sum of the parts. Here I have described only those that occur with sufficient frequency in the
Berkeley Ingush Corpus to support descriptions in standard terms.
     For practical purposes the tenses can be divided into suffixed ones and those formed with
auxiliaries. Some of the tense suffixes have distinctive morphophophonemics that point to an
origin in clitics, and some are etymologically identical to independent verb forms and must
once have been auxiliaries, but they are all suffixes at this point. The auxiliaries are written
as separate words in Ingush spelling, and they are separate syntactic words: they can be
moved by word-order rules, can stand alone as answers to questions, etc., and some of them
can determine the case of the subject, overriding the lexical verb's case assignment.","[266, 267]"

"      Content questions often involve clefting (§28.7). Clefting is common when the
interrogative word is a case-inflected word (notably, mala 'who') and is near-obligatory when
the case would be ergative. In clefting, the interrogative word is a predicate nominal with
'be', hence in the nominative case. The interrogative word (with cliticized 'be') is usually
either final or initial. Initial position generally suggests focus or emphasis on the
interrogative word; final position topicalizes the initial constituent.230(14)   Wa-viezhaar           maluu?                 {mala=vy}

meaning is that the speaker infers (not from evidence but logically) that the event must have
happened. In (78) the interviewer knows that the person in question was shown on television
and confirms the speaker's statement. This tense is often used in the consequence clause of a
conditional construction. Note that in form it looks like a future perfect ('will have gone',
etc.), but it never seems to have such a meaning.",[282]
"                                  29.7. Null pronominalsIngush is not a pro-drop language. It can be seen in the texts in Chapter 35 that most clauses
have all arguments overt. However, null anaphora is systematically used in contexts where
the clause-to-clause connection is close and recoverability of reference guaranteed by both
syntax and sense. One such context is question-and-answer sequences and similar short-
response dialog, where pronouns referring to the speakers are usually omitted, as in (5)-(8) in
§35.3 where the verbs eannad 'said' have no overt subjects. These are finite verbs; null
anaphora is very common with subordinating converbs (§13.9, Chapter 27, §29.2 above).
     In Ingush many sentences lack an overt S or (as seems to be much more frequent) A and
the subject is generic or unspecified. Often these are comparable to French on, German man,
or Russian subjectless verbs with third person plural morphology, meaning an unspecified or
generic human agent, e.g. (21) in Chapter 11 (where there is no overt A with koradead
'found') or (85) in Chapter 20 (where c'i tillaai 'named (him)' has no overt A). The German
and French pronouns and the Russian agreement identify a human referent, but the Ingush has
no overt marking (the ergative A is simply lacking and this of course has no effect on the
agreement or case assignment in the clause) and does not necessarily imply human agency as
in (177), where something happened or was done to the second person but it is unknown
whether it was done by humans:(177) Fy dead         hwuona?
      what D.do.NW.D 2s.DAT
      What happened to you?",[691]

      V.be:PRS.NEG 1s 2s.GEN friend
      I'm not your friend. I'm no friend of yours. (PL 2.2)30.4.2. Argument focus. Most often the focal nominal or NP is clause-initial and the verb (or
the finite auxiliary of a verb in a compound tense) follows immediately after it. The
postverbal elements then follow in their usual order (subject, indirect object, direct object),
followed by the nonfinite part of a compound tense. The appearance of the verb in the
position after this nominal is unlike any other word-order process in Ingush in that it is just
the conjugated verb form – the finite auxiliary of a verb in a compound tense, or the shorn
stem of a prefixed verb – that is moved; the rest (the prefixes, the nonfinite part of an analytic
                                       30. Word order                                  687
tense form) remains at the end of the sentence. Enclitics that can attach only to the verb,
however, stay with the conjugated form. A parenthetical word is discounted in figuring
second position.
    In the following examples the second-position finite verb form is boldface. (104)-(105)
have a simple verb following a one-word focal NP. Another example is (55 = 61) above.
Content questions (§30.3.1 above) are also examples of argument focus.","[709, 710]"

                      Abbreviations and interlinear conventions     The interlinearizing conventions for examples cited here (most of them taken from the
Berkeley Ingush Corpus) were initially worked out in 1996 by Zev Handel and Ronald
Sprouse for an example sentences database accompanying the lexical database on which
Nichols & Sprouse 2004 is based. The example sentences database formed the core of BITC
(Sprouse 1997), which holds the Berkeley Ingush Corpus described in Data Sources below.
     Inflectional morpheme boundaries are generally not written in the Ingush forms (they are
written only where the segmentation is at issue), and in the interlinear their categories are
separated by periods (not hyphens). This is done in part because many inflectional categories
are marked by ablaut, suppletion, and other unsegmentable phenomena; in part because it is
not always clear whether the schwa vowels often found at inflectional morpheme boundaries
should be segmented with the root or with the affix; and in part in order to ensure that words
look as much as possible like readable words. Syntactically relevant derivational morphemes,
especially verb prefixes and valence-affecting suffixes, are hyphenated off.
     Syntax examples extracted from natural text have sometimes had pauses, corrections, etc.
editorially removed where this does not affect the point at issue. In Chapter 35 (Texts), all
such things are intact.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"A verb derivational suffix, however, is not detached from the preverbal material when used
with a question word, as with the inceptive in (91):(91)   Senna tossa-vannuu               hwo suoca?

       * Maca yz aaravealar?                      * Yz aara maca vealar?","[707, 708]"
"5.10.5. Simplex word plus any enclitics:
    Schwa elision (§3.2.2)
    High tone spread (leftward from enclitic) (see Chapter 4, especially §4.2)5.10.6. Any inflected form (simplex or compound):
    Affix-final voicing (§3.2.9)
    Word-final partial devoicing (§3.3.5)5.10.7. Prefixed verb form, compound, or similar two-word syntagma:                  Primary and
secondary stress assignment (§§4.1.1, 4.1.2)5.10.8. Parsing into IP, high and low accent assignment: No statable domain, but just the
last two stressed words or stems in the phrase or clause (§4.1.3)5.10.9. The minimal free form in Ingush is the inflected verb form. An underived simplex
verb root with zero inflection, i.e. the present tense form, can be a self-standing utterance, e.g.
in an answer to a question:(23) A: Ahwmad oalii             cynagh?                          B: Oal.
        Ahmed       say.PRS=Q    3s.LAT                              say.PRS
        Is his name Ahmed? Is he called Ahmed?                       Yes.",[147]
"The witnessed past ending -âr carries high tone while the homophonous ending of the
imperfect does not. The two tenses differ in vowel grade in some conjugations, but only in
tone in others:(33)   tiexâr      'struck'
       tuôxar      'used to strike'(34)   latâr       'fought' (lätar)
       lâtar       'used to fight' (latar)(35)   vaxiitâr    'sent (him), had (him) go' (go.CSind.WP)
       vaxîitar    'used to send (him), used to have (him) go' (go.CSind.IMPF)On a long vowel as in (33) the tone is a clear rise on the tonic syllable and fall on the next.
     The three enclitics listed above (the chaining particle, coordinating enclitic, and
interrogative enclitic) have the high tone, but other enclitics such as the contrastive particle
=m and the cumulative focus particle =q do not. Therefore, though Ingush cannot be said to
have a tone opposition of even a minimal sort, it does seem to have a contrast between
presence and absence of tone on some clitics and suffixes (but, interestingly, no major-class
root morphemes have lexically contrastive tone).
     The mild imperative ending -l also carries high tone which surfaces on the preceding
vowel. Native speakers mostly consider the high tone of the mild imperative to be the
question intonation contour and optional, but in natural speech it seems to be invariably
present.",[130]
"For such examples it is difficult or impossible to know whether there is a null unspecified or
generic A or there is no A at all and the verb is ambitransitive. (See §21.2.7 and the footnote
there.) More research is needed on the question: if A's are freely omissible and most putative
transitive verbs are actually ambitransitive, then this is another profoundly ergative trait in the
lexicon and syntax of Ingush.

                                      WORD ORDER     Ingush is a consistently head-final language except for predominantly verb-second order
in main clauses. Verb-second order is much like that of Germanic languages in that the finite
verb is clause-second but its preverb, including prefixes, is clause-final. Nearly all phrases
and non-main clauses are head-final. In addition to verb-second order in main clauses there
are other, often pragmatically determined but always grammatically defined, word orders that
place elements in clause-initial or clause-final position or postpose modifiers of nouns. These
departures respond to such factors as chaining, interrogative words, topicalization, and focus.
Impressionistically, Ingush word-order changes are similar to those of Russian in some of
their pragmatic effects and in their frequency and variety, but they are unlike those of Russian
in the extent to which word order possibilities are are defined by syntactic boundaries.","[691, 692]"

      {wa-shaara-}. I do not understand why the root-initial /sh/ is geminated, but it is clearly
audible in the recording and two different speakers agree that it is there and is correct. The
Chechen cognate to Ingush wa- 'down' is ohwa (Ingush has pharyngeal attraction to the initial
glottal stop, and loss of the *hw), and perhaps the root-initial gemination is a reflex of the now-lost
final consonant of the prefix. Alternatively, perhaps this is focus gemination on a root-initial but
word-medial consonant.

the entire clause or sentence into focus or emphasis in a larger discourse context. Often the
preceding sentence or two lead up to the focal one; sometimes the focal one is a key juncture
in a narrative or the summary of an argument or other discussion. Sometimes the particle can
be glossed ""Oh, it's just that…"",""What's going on is..."", ""The point is ..."", or "" ..., that's what /
why ..."". Some speakers use it more often than others. There are several examples in §35.3.
     This particle is pronounced as a cluster with any consonant that precedes it, without any
assimilation, epenthetic schwa, or other adjustment.
     The following are two examples where =q was said by consultants to be more or less
obligatory:(205) je goura     balie='a,     je waatta  balie='a     kuorta chy='a tassie,

are written hyphenated to the verb they follow, but phonologically and syntactically they
appear to be no less independent words than joax or hwuona (§§13.6.1-3 above), which are
never written with a hyphen. They are more or less synonymous introspective interrogatives
that can be rendered 'I wonder whether' (often with an implication that the speaker hopes the
complement is or will be true) and are used almost exclusively in questions (including
interrogative complements) and almost never on negative forms.
     In main clauses hwogh is used most often in questions, where the sense is 'I wonder
whether…', 'I wonder what…', etc. It looks like a form of the second person singular
pronoun, but in natural text examples it seems that the speaker never expects the hearer to
have the answer.(213) galanjg jaaxar       fy    mawan dolazh         dy-hwogh

written as a separate phrase. There are exceptions, however, and the question of whether
compounds should be written as one word or not continues to be debated. For convenience,
conventionally univerbated and conventionally non-univerbated compounds are discussed in
separate sections here.","[187, 188]"

   The productive ergative ending in Batsbi is v, where the ergative of 'water' is xiv (Holisky
1994:164-166). Ozdoev et al. 1961 give ergatives ""cheava"" (  ) and ""shureva"" or ""shurieva""
( ), but in the pronunciations I have heard the stem vowel is phonetically short, so there
cannot be a final schwa on the ending.        Kurkiev 2004 gives ergatives xivuo, cheavuo,
shuruo/shurievuo ( ,   , / ) with the productive ending -uo added to the -v-,
and I have heard these as well.

                                         2.5. Schwa     In this section, [ˆ] marks high pitch assigned by the clitic conjunction ='a (see §2.6 and
§4.2); [˙] is an unvocalized schwa. These are specialized phonetic or more abstract
transcriptions used chiefly in this section. The quasi-orthographic transcription of schwa in
this grammar is not entirely phonemic. Some high-frequency morphemes with schwas are
spelled at a level more abstract than the phoneme. Though the grounds for the spellings will
be explained later in this section, it may be useful to summarize the relevant transcription
principles and the main examples at the outset:      (1) Restressed schwa (§2.5.4) is written “y” even after /j/ (where it is acually pronounced
/i/), for paradigmatic consistency:     vy, jy, by, dy        'is, are' (present tense copula)        , , ,      (2) Clitics which alternate between restressed and posttonic (i.e. unstressed) position are
written with a single vocalism, that of their restressed variants:     chy=, t'y=            'in', 'on' (verbal proclitics and clitic postpositions)   , 1    (3) Posttonic schwas are written “a”, though they represent a neutralization of short
vowels and have an indistinct and variable quality that makes them hard to ascribe to any one
phoneme:     jurtazh               'towns'                                

     lazar                 'pain, ache'                            The spelling ""ig"" is used for the vocalized allomorph of the denominal noun-forming suffix
consisting of a schwa followed by a palatalized velar. (The non-vocalized allomorph will be
written ""jg"", where devoiced ""jk"", and after vowels ""gj"".)     burtig                'kernel'           /burtagj/                     

   Historically {cic-jg}, cf. Chechen cick, cicig and the Russified Ingush last name Cickiev from
the clan name Cysjka neaq'aan < *Cicjka neaq'aan (whose eponymous mythic ancestor was so
nicknamed because he survived nine stabbings as an infant).

     (4) Unstressed schwa in root-initial syllables is identical to /a/. It is [´] = /e/ after /j/, in
the preposed unaccented word je 'or'. It is /a/ [Ø] elsewhere, e.g. in indirect causatives which
are stressed on the second syllable (§4.1), e.g. d.axiita 'D.go.CSind' 'send, have go'. It is a
lower /a/ when pharyngealized, as in the usually unstressed deictic prefixes:    dwa-                     'away from speaker'                             1-
    hwa-                     'toward speaker'                                -
    wa-                      'down'                                          1-
    hwal-                    'up'                                            -and a few other words with non-initial stress, e.g. waléamatie 'extremely' (but not the place
name Pw(y)léaq'on-jurt 'Plievo'; see §4.1). When pharyngealization attraction removes the
pharyngealization from a deictic prefix, the schwa of the prefix surfaces with [Ø] quality. For
pharyngealization attraction see §3.3.6. That [Ø] quality is to be expected is explained in
§2.5.2.    dwa-aara-vealar          [dØ¿aÚr˙veal˙r]    'went out'          1
    DX- out- V.went
The allophony [e] after /j/, otherwise [Ø] is the same in tonic syllables (see §§2.4.2.4, 2.4.2.7).
      Both je 'or' and the deictic prefixes might be regarded as special clitics, but I analyze
them simply as prosodically unaccented words and not as atonic. Enclitics are indubitable
clitics and firmly atonic, and their schwa has higher, more centralized, and less distinct
vocalism. The enclitic chaining/coordinating conjunction ='a usually has an elided vowel,
but whatever vowel quality can be heard after the glottal stop is at least as high as IPA [\].
The schwa in the other coordinating enclitic =ji is more audible and sounds identical to /i/ [I].
      2.5.1. Reduction, elision, and vocalization of schwas. All non-tonic short vowels merge
into a single schwa phoneme whose pronunciation is highly variable and which in some
positions is not audible as a segment (though it generaly has audible effects on adjacent
segments). Since it is the result of neutralization, it could be written with any vowel letter.
Here in most contexts it is written with “a”, as is done in the Cyrillic orthography. The
Ingush schwa has several of the properties associated with schwa phonemes cross-
linguistically: variable quality, epenthesis, and positionally conditioned reduction or loss.
      In Ingush, word-final schwas are devoiced or lost entirely. Nonetheless, a schwa opens a
preceding syllable (providing an intersyllabic consonant cluster does not inherently close
syllables), and it has other detectable phonological and morphological consequences, so its
presence must be recognized. Schwas can be described as vocalized, unvocalized, and
unpronounced, and these treatments follow from the phonological context.
      (1) Vocalized (or strong). Pronounced as a true vowel with full voicing. This occurs in
specifiable syllabic environments, e.g. where otherwise impermissible clusters would be
formed (examples underlined):
