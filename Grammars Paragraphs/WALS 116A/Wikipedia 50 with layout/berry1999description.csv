6. 1 . 1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
   There are many characteristics that distinguish yes/no questions from other structures in
the world's languages. Characteristics listed by Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 8 1 ) in order of
frequency in their sample were: rising final intonation contour, a sentence-initial particle, a
sentence-final particle, special verb morphology and word order. Abun yes/no questions are
marked with an optional sentence-initial particle and an obigatory sentence-final particle.
   The structure of a YES/NO question in Abun is:                                         (te) CLAUSE e
  The Yes/No Question Marker e is always used in yes/no questions. However, the 'Initial
Question Marker' te is always optional and more often than not is omitted. Of those yes/no
questions studied, about 35% used te o Examples 6 . 1 and 6.2 illustrate typical yes/no
questions, showing that with or without te the meaning is the same.
   6 . 1 a.   Te    nan kra        it     e?
              IQM 2sG marry        O\M       YNQ'v1
              Are you married?
         b.   Nan kra      it  e?
              2sG marry O\M YNQ'v1
              Are you married?
   6 . 2 a.   Te   nan nai nan bi                 suk       it       e?
              IQM 2sG get 2sG POSS                things    O\M      YNQ'v1
              Have you got your things?
         b.   Nan nai nan b i          suk            it    e?
              2sG get 2sG poss things                 O\M   YNQ'v1
              Have you got your things?
    One of the most striking characteristics of yes/no questions noted by researchers is a
rising-final intonation contour (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 1 8 1 ). An analysis of the intonation
patterns in Abun yes/no questions reveals the opposite, that is a falling final intonation
contour. The intonation pattern for interrogati ve sentences is the same as that for indicative
sentences. Therefore intonation is not such a significant distinguishing feature of yes/no
questions in Abun as it is in many other languages. Ultan ( 1 978:230) points out that in his
79-language sample, those languages that had prepositions always had a rising terminal
MARKED MOODS                                                                                  1 03contour intonation pattern. Abun is clearly an exception to this (see Figures 6. 1 and 6.2 below
which contrast yes/no and confirmative question intonation patterns).
   There are three basic systems for short answers to yes/no questions: yes/no,
agree/disagree and echo systems. Abun speakers use a mixture of these systems: an echo
system for positive responses; and a negative particle, nde, for negative responses. They do
not have both positive and negative particles for answering like the English 'yes' and 'no ' ,
but rather they only have the negative particle. When a question such a s that in example 6 . 3 i s
asked, a positive answer would be the echo, 'There is cooked food ' . Frequently such answers
may be shortened even further, a possible response to 6.3 being rna 'there i s ' . A negative
response would require the use of nde 'no ' .
   6.3       A     kon   suk    a            yo   jon    e?
             2sG cook thing PAUSE            some cooked YI'Q\1
             Have you cooked anything?
   Although Abun speakers use an echo system for positive responses, their body-language
responses to yes/no questions uses a yes/no system. Raising of the eyebrows means 'yes ' ,
and turning up of their nose means 'no ' .","[114, 115]"
"
6. 1 .2 CONFlRMATIVE QUESTIO S
  This type of question asks for confirmation of a presumed situation. The structure is:
                                         (Ie) CLAusEfe
   Such constructions are very simi lar to yes/no questions, but they have a n SlTIg final
intonation contour and use the marker fe 'Confirmative Question Marker, CQM' sentence­
final ly, as in examples 6.4 and 6.5.
  6.4        Te    ji     bi     suk      ane     fe ?
             IQM I sG POSS thing          OEM     CQM
             That's mine ! Right?
   6.5       Ndo fe ?
             good CQM
             l . That's good! Right?
             2. That's good, isn't it?
   These questions presume a positive response and may also be called positively biased
yes/no questions. Negati vely biased yes/no questions, such as in example 6.6, are
unacceptable to an Abun speaker.
   6.6       *Ndar anane nde fe ?
             dog     OET       NEG CQM
             That's not a dog, right?
   Confirmative questions not only have a distinct FQM, but are also distinguished from
yes/no questions by a rising final intonation contour. Example 6.7 has the intonation pattern
as shown in Figure 6. 1 , which contrasts with the intonation pattern for the yes/no question of
6.8, shown in Fi gure 6.2 below.

6. 1 .3 ALTERNATIVE QUESTIONS
    In an alternative question, two or more possibilities are presented by the speaker.
Combinations include two possibilities such as, 'Do you want to go, or not?' , where the
alternative is a positive or negative reply; or 'Do you want a banana, or a coconut?' , where
the alternative is between two items. Another possibi lity is where one alternative is specified
and the second alternative seeks information such as, ""Is the palm wine sweet, or what?""
Also more extensive lists of alternative items are possible.
  For an alternative question where there are two alternatives, the structure is:
                                      (Ie) CLAUSE bado CLAUSE e
   Example 6.9 illustrates two alternatives:
MARKED MOODS                                                                                     105   6.9       A    kra    Moses bado a         bari             e?
             2sG marry Moses AQv1        2sG do.not.want Yl'QvI
             Do you want to marry Moses, or don ' t you want to?
   Instead of having a number of varied alternatives, a further possibility is to have just two
alternatives, one being the negation of the other. In these cases the first alternative (which is
positive) is followed by bado, while the second alternative is the negative particle, nde,
followed by the yes/no question marker, e. Thus the structure of a positive-negative
alternative question is:
                                      (te) CLAUSE bado nde e
   Example 6 . 1 0 illustrates this type of question.
   6. 10     Te men frot           an       bado, nde e ?
             IQM 1 PL     inform 3PL        NJ>1  NEG Yl'QvI
             Will we tell them or not?
  This form is often shortened by the ellipsis of nde e resulting in a form like that of yes/no
questions, but with a different FQM, that is bado. Such a form, as in example 6. 1 1 , is still a
positive/negative alternative question. It has the same meaning as if nde e was present.
   6. 1 1    A    jam    nadi, bado ?
             2sG know pray AQv1
             Do you know how to pray (or not)?
   This type of construction could be called a truncated positive-negative alternative question.
The addition of nde e makes the question more forceful and is used in cases where a
question, like that in example 6. 1 1 , is ignored or not answered quickly enough, so the
speaker would reiterate the question with nde e in addition to bado.
   A further variation of the type of alternative question is one where the final alternative
seeks information. The final clause follows the same structure as i nformation-seeking
questions, discussed in §6. 1 .4. Example 6 . 1 2 illustrates this type, where the last alternative is
actually an information-seeking question, and uses the particle ne as FQM.
   6. 1 2    Nau         ne   wik             bado sa            u        ne ?
             palm. wine DEI' good.tasting AQv1       like        which    FQM
             Does that palm wine taste good, or what?
   Regarding intonation in alternative questions, Abun has a falling final intonation contour
on bado in much the same way as intonation falls in yes/no questions as well as indicative
sentences.
   No matter what type of alternative question is asked, the syntax is the same, that is the
'Alternative Question Marker' (AQM), bado, fol lows each alternative. The final alternative is
followed by its relevant QM, usually the yes/no question marker, except for cases where it is
one seeking information. The 'Initial Question Marker' (IQM) is optionally present, as for
other question types. The structure of an alternative question (where n + 1 = the number of
alternatives) is:                                  [(te) CLAUSE bado ] n CLAUSE e
1 06                                                                                     CHAPTER 6
   In example 6. 1 3 there are four alternati ves. Each one, except the last, is fol lowed by bado.
This means that the clause which precedes it is in question as a possible alternative and every
clause in an alternative question must be followed by bado. The comma before bado and the
semicolon after it represent a pause and a longer pause respectively.
   6. 1 3    Be     nggon     gato    syimfar ne te           mu     ben suk    mo nggwe
             will   girl      who     pregnant OEM IQM        go     do  things at garden
             dom, bado; mu os    syu dom, bado; sam suk       de    dom, bado;
             also A(Jv1. go path long also ACJv1 carry things heavy also A(Jv1.
             an     kem mo nu         sore etejo an                 nu,     e?
             she stay at home only then she sweeps house YI'\Q\1
             When a woman is pregnant does she also go to the garden, does she go on
             long trips too, does she carry heavy things too, or does she just stay at home
             and sweep the house?
6. 1 .4 lNFORMATION-SEEKING QUESTIONS
   Questions seeking information, such as those asking 'who ' , 'what ' , 'how ' , 'wh y ' , ' when '
and 'where ' , are all formed in Abun in a similar way. They follow the general bracketing
pattern that is evident in negation. A question of this type is formed by using two particles or
markers: te (always optional) at the start of the sentence and fQ\1 at the end. An interrogative
proform is also used in conjunction with these markers. This is a rare combination according
to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 83), who say that inversion and special morphology
frequently co-occur with interrogative words, whereas particles and contrastive intonation do
not.
   The structure of information-seeking interrogative sentences in Abun is:
                                   (Ie) S v 0 ADJUNCT (Q) FQM
where FQM is a 'Final Question Marker' and (Q) represents a single interrogative word which
may fol low one of either the subject, the verb, the object or the adj uncts, depending upon
which constituent is being interrogated. Exceptions to this pattern occur when information
seeking-interrogative sentences are topicalised, as in example 6. 14. This pattern is discussed
in detail in §6. 1 .4.4.
   6.14      Ben sa         u       anato nan yo ma       more nde             ne ?
             do     like which FOC           2SG NEG come here NEG             FQM
             1 . How i s it that you didn 't come here?
             2. Why didn ' t you come here?
    Regarding the initial marker, te, in a sample of 194 questions in text material te occurred
4 1 times, that i s about 2 1 % of information-seeking questions use teo Therefore questions like
that in example 6. 1 5 are without the IQM and are more common than those with teo
   6.15      Ii    bi     suma is nan o ?
             l sG give what 10 2sG FQM
             1 . What can I give to you?
             2. How can I help you?
MARKED MOODS                                                                                       1 07   The final question marker (FQM) is either ne or o. The use of either one of these particles is
obligatory. The particles ne and 0 are used interchangeably, with no change in meaning. So
example 6. 16a has the same meaning as 6 . 1 6b. These two particles appear to have been
originally dialectal variants which have now been incorporated into all dialects. There is no
apparent difference in meaning; ne is more common than 0, occurring in 90% of all
questions analysed.
   6 . 1 6 a. Nan jan      suma ne ?
              2SG plant what fQM
              What did you plant?
            b. Nan jan      suma o ?
               2SG plant what fQM
               What did you plant?
  Both particles (te . . . ne/o) bracket the whole sentence irrespective of its complexity. In a
complex sentence as in example 6. 1 7, two clauses are embedded: a relative clause and a
dependent purpose clause. Both are bracketed by the initial and final particles.
   6. 1 7      Te ye         gato i        ne git suma sube             an   ge 6 ne ?
               IQM person REL sick DEY eat what so.that 3PL well again FQM
               1 . People who are sick eat what so they will get well again?
               2. What do sick people eat so they will get well again?
   Information-seeking questions have a final falling intonation contour similar to yes/no and
alternative questions. Such type of intonation is not what would be expected according to the
findings by U1tan ( 1 978:230), where he points out that information questions have a
considerably better-than-chance probability of having a rising terminal contour.
    The question word fol lows the constituent that is the focus of interrogation. In example
6. 1 8, the subject, that is 'the person who came ' , is the focus of interrogation; whereas in 6. 1 9
the object, that is 'the types of plants' , i s the focus of interrogation. I n 6.20 the location is the
focus of interrogation, and in 6.21 the indirect object is the focus of interrogation.
   6. 1 8     Te je        u     ma   more n e ?
              IQ'v1 person which come here FQM
              Who came here?
   6.19       Te    nan jan      suk-jan  u   ne ?
              IQ'v1 2sG plant NOM-plant which FQM
              Which plants did you plant?
   6.20       Nan grem buku ne          mo         u     ne ?
              2sG put     book OEM we              which FQM
              Where did you put the book?
   6.21       Te   an    syo buku n e nai je                      u         ne?
              IQM 3sG give book OEM 10     person                 which     FQM
              Who did he give the book to?
   With regard to the interrogative proforms used in information-seeking questions, Abun
has only three. According to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 84), theoretically it should be
possible that only one single morpheme, glossed as 'what ' , is needed. Therefore, all
108                                                                                  CHAPTER 6
information questions would involve periphrasis (that is, 'what person' for who, 'what place'
for where, and so on). However, in practice the smallest system known to them is the
Yokuts system with three interrogative words. Abun can therefore be added as one of the
smallest systems known. The three proforms are :              sum a          what               general interrogative
              u              which              specific interrogative
              ot             how many           pronumeral i nterrogative
  Table 6.2 shows each interrogative word and its periphrasis together with the equivalent
question words in English.
     Abun is even more unusual than Yokuts, not having a distinct interrogative proform that
makes a distinction between personal and impersonal ( ' who' and 'what' in English). Ultan
( 1 97 8:229) points out that this contrast is almost always present. But instead Abun forms the
pronominal interrogative, 'who ' , by a combination of je 'person ' and u 'which' .
   Each interrogative word with examples of various question types i s discussed below.

5.7.2 DISJUNCTION
   According to Payne ( 1 985a:40), the majority of languages appear to possess at least one
unequivocal strategy for disjunction, and this is invariably permitted at sentential and phrasal
levels. This is true in Abun. The basic structure for disjunction is for the speaker to fol low
each phrase or sentence with the word, bado. In Abun, disjunct phrases consist of: NP bado NP
bado and so on. The form bado is the alternative conjunction.
     Examples of the use of bado from sentence to phrase level are:(i) Sentence:
     5 . 1 86   Pa    yo    ki    nai    bado   Ester rnu      rno     Barbarina     ete
                child DEY   say   to     or     Ester go       LOC     Barbarina     and.then
                rna     bado ...
                come or
                A child told (them) or Ester went to Barbarina and came (with the answer) ...
PHRASE SlRUCfURE                                                                             99(ii) Prepositional Phrase:
   5 . 1 87   Pa    ne     rno nu        bado rno nggwe bado.
              child DEf LOC house or             LOC garden or
              The child is at home or in the garden.(iii) Possessive Phrase:
   5 . 1 88   Barbarina titi     rnu   kern    rno    gato Yulius b i        nu      ne     ti
              Barbarina flee     go    stay    LOC    RH.. Yulius poss       house   DEf    sea
              bado Obet bi           nu            bado...
              or      Obet POSS house o w n or
              Barbarina fled and stayed at Yulius' house at the sea or Obet' s house...(iv) Noun Phrases:
   5 . 1 89   An    so     pa      re     tepsu jot bado        kokor     bado.
              3SG sell child this like            pIg or        chicken   or
              He sold the child like a pig or a chicken.
   5 . 1 90   Erensi nai      rnbre toba      re     sak         w e bado     sak
              Erensi took     cloth toba      this   handspan    two or       handspan
              gri   bado sak            at     bado.
              three or      hands pan four or
              Erensi took the toba cloth, (it was) two or three or four handspans.
    Payne ( l 985a:40) also points out that in certain environments the distinction between
'and' and 'or' (when the latter is indifferent in the choice between the elements) may be a
minimal one. For example, in example 5 . 1 74 above, an alternative translation would be, 'Eat
animals such as wild pigs (or), kangaroos (or), tree kangaroos or the like ' . Likewise, there is
some merging of 'and' and 'or' in examples 5 . 1 65 and 5 . 175. On the other hand, examples
5. 1 73 and 5 . 1 85 may not be translated as 'or' , but must only be 'and' .
  Juxtaposition is sometimes used as an alternative to bado. It is particularly evident when
quantifiers are used in noun phrases, such as in example 5. 1 9 1 .
   5.191      rnbre dik y o w e yo
              cloth one a two a
              one or two cloths
   Other alternatives to bado, that are frequently used as alternative conjunctions in spoken
Abun, are ke and ka. These come from Biak and Indonesian respectively, the latter being a
corruption of the yes/no question particle, kah. This has come about because bado is used in
asking alternative or tag questions, as in 'An rna, bado, (nde e) ?' 'He has corne or (not)?'
Frequently nde e is omitted, so the alternative conjunction may also act like a yes/no
interrogative particle. Thus Abun speakers have adopted the Indonesian, kah, and use that
just as they use their own, bado; that is, as an alternative conjunction and in alternative
questions, even though in Indonesian kah is only a yes/no question marker and not an
alternative conj unction. The alternative conjunction in Indonesian is atau, which also is
sometimes borrowed by Abun speakers. Examples are:
1 00                                                                              CHAPTER S

                                           CHAPTER6
                                     MARKED MOODS    There are three moods which are marked in Abun, namely interrogative, i mperative and
frustrated action. Mood is marked by a clause-final particle which fol lows other particles (that
is, those that mark negation, aspect and modality). Each marked mood will be discussed in
tum.
6. 1 lNTERROGATIVE MOOD
   Interrogative mood, like other moods in Abun, uses particles. Two particles are used to
bracket or delineate the constituent being interrogated. The pattern of bracketing a
grammatical constituent by particles is a feature of the Abun language. It is used in negation
(see §8 .2), and also in relative clauses, both restricted and unrestricted, as discussed in §9.
  The basic structure of an interrogative sentence in Abun is:
                                        IQM clause FQM
   The optional particle te (referred to as IQM 'Initial Question Marker' ) and another particle
called FQM 'Final Question Marker' bracket the clause in question. For all question types te is
the IQM, but the particle FQM varies according to the type of question being asked.
   The initial particle te, although now apparently totally optional, may well have been an
obligatory part of interrogative structures in the past, before the influence of the national
language, Indonesian. This is borne out by the fact that those less influenced by the national
language, from interior villages, use te much more than those on the coast, where the effects
of the national language are more prevalent.
  As a general rule, the pattern of intonation in interrogative sentences is a final falling
contour. The exception is confirmative questions which have a final rising intonation.
   All interrogatives are seeking some type of information. On lexical grounds, namely the
variation in the FQM particle, it is apparent that Abun has four basic types of interrogatives.
The four types are the:
   •   YES/NO (or NEXUS) question, one that seeks a comment on the truth of a proposition;
   •   CONFIRMATfYE question, that seeks agreement, or confirmation from the addressee;
   •   ALTERNATIVE question, which provides a list of possibilities from which the
       addressee selects an answer;
   •   INFORMATION or QUESTION WORD question, which seeks particular information such
       as 'who ' , ' what ' , ' how ' , 'why ' , ' when' and 'where ' .","[110, 111, 112, 113]"
"   Example 8 .6 has the same structure, but differs in meaning. It comes from a text where
the speaker is lecturing another about his relationship with his wife. He is not asking whether
the one addressed thinks about his wife, or not, as in a positive-negative alternative type of
question. Rather, he is using it as a rhetorical question with the meaning, ' You don't think
about your wife' ! The context makes it clear when a negative tag question is being asked or is
being used rhetorically.

                Don ' t you think about your wife?
  Negative yes/no interrogative structures such as, 'Are you not going?' are not used in
Abun. Instead the Abun speaker would formulate this type of question as, Nan mu e ? 'Are
you going?'","[145, 146]"

   Questions inquiring into what type of actions someone has done, (example 6.33) or will
do in the future (6.34) use ben sa u 'do like what' . There is an overlap in the use of suma and
u in these types of questions. In both cases below, suma could replace u and be syntactically
correct. However when suma is used the answer sought would be more general in nature,
consistent with the differentiation between these two interrogative words explained above.
   6.33      Kamekre nggon       ne    ben sa            u          ne ?

             What do people here do so that they won 't get malaria?(v) where, from where, which direction
   For questions regarding location, source or direction the appropriate preposition is used
together with u. So for location, mo u means 'where' in example 6.35; source, kagit u 'from
where' as in 6.36 and direction, ket u 'which direction' as in 6.37.
  6.35       Nan ontu            mo        u         ne?

             woman evil     go way which fQM
             Which way did the evil woman go?(vi) why
   Another type of question asked using u is questions that inquire as to the reason for a
particular action, or inaction, as in example 6.38.
1 12                                                                                 CHAPTER 6

             Why are you forbidden (to eat) that?(vii) when
  Questions asking about time usually use the interrogative pronumeral, ot; however, when
one is asked to specify the name of the day or month u can be used, as in example 6.39.
   6.39      Kam u       e te nan mu          ne ?
             day which then 2sG go            FQM
             When will you be going?
6. 1 .4.2 suma QUESTIONS
   The interrogative word, suma, is used to form questions inquiring about the identity of
something, as in example 6.40, the nature of a particular action, as in 6.4 1 , the reason for a
particular action, as in 6.42, or its topicalisation, as in 6.43.(i) what
   6.40      Nan sok suma ne ?
             2SG fish what FQM
             What do you fish for?
   6.4 1     A n ben suma o ?
             3sG do    what FQM
             What did he do?(ii) why
   6.42      Nan yo       ma     more nde wa suma n e ?
             2SG NEG come here          NEG for what FQM
             Why didn ' t you come here?(iii) why (topicalised)
   6.43      Suma ben anato nan yo ma                    more nde ne ?
             what do FOC           2sG NEG come here NEG FQM
             1 . What was the reason that you didn ' t come here?
             2. Why was it that you didn't come?
  The distinction between u and suma is one of specific and general. U is more specific than
suma. Consider examples 6.44 and 6.45 below.
   6.44      Nan jan      suk-jan     u  ne ?
             2sG plant NOM-plant which FQM
             Which plants did you plant?
   6.45      Nan jan      suma ne ?
             2sG plant what FQM
             What did you plant?
MARKED MOODS                                                                                  113   Example 6.44 i s looking for a more specific answer than 6.45. We may get an answer like
com, cassava and tomatoes; whereas the answer to the second question may be something
more general, like vegetables. Often the answer may not be different, but the question in
example 6.45 is more likely to result in a less specific answer.
  Suma is limited in its use as an interrogative word to asking questions such as 'what' or
'why ' . However u is more widely used and is involved in periphrasis to form most types of
questions, such as 'who ' , 'whose ' , 'what' , 'which ' , 'where ' , 'why ' , 'how ' and 'when ' .
  The third interrogative word, o t 'how many' , is used in forming questions relating to
quantity and time, that is, 'when ' and 'how many' .
6. 1 .4.3 ot QUESTIONS
   The interrogative pronumeral ot is used to form questions about time and quantity. There
is some overlap of u and ot in asking time questions. Compare example 6.46 below with
6.39 above. The difference is that in 6.39 the answer would be expected to name a day,
month or other point in time, such as next year; whereas 6.46 would expect an answer such
as 'in five days' or 'three months', that is with some type of numerical response.
   6.46      Kam ot            ete   nan          mu    ne ?
             day how. many then      2SG          go    FQM
             When will you be going?
   There are no tense markers on verbs in Abun, so whether a time question (such as in
example 6.47) is in the past or future is determined by reference to the context, or by the
special use of the word ete 'then' , (as in 6.46) or be 'later' (as in 6.48) to indicate future

   To ask about the duration of some event, kom mo is used instead of su, as in example
6.49.
  6.49       Nan kem more kom mo kam                   ot            ne ?

             How long have you lived here?
   Ot is also used in questions of quantity. In this type, ot follows the noun for a specific
item such as 'pigs' or 'money' with its appropriate classifier, as in examples 6.50 and 6.5 1 .
See §3.4. 1 . for a list of classifiers and the types of nouns to which they apply.

   The word warn 'times' does not require a classifier, as in examples 6.52 and 6.53.
   6.52      Te nan i      su    suk-i     sunggu              ne warn ot               ne ?

8. 1 .2 POSlTIVE-NEGATIVE ALlERNATIVE QUESTIONS
  The primary negative particle is also used in asking positive-negative alternative questions.
The structure of this type is:                                      S PRED badu nde e?
   These questions could be called negative tag questions with a positive-negative alternative,
'Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?' , as in example 8 . 5 where a person is being
asked to make a decision between positive and negative alternatives.
   8.5        Nan satu        mo     nan   bi       nggon   bado, nde    e?

4.5.4 MOOD
    According to Lyons ( 1 968:307) the term mood ""is best defined in relation to an
' unmarked' class of sentences which express simple statements of fact, unqualified with
respect to the attitude of the speaker towards what he is saying"".
   In Abun the indicative mood is unmarked while the other two basic types of mood are
marked by the use of particles which occur clause-final. In addition Abun also marks another
mood, that of frustrated action. A list of all Abun mood particles is given in Table 3 . 1 6 in
§3.4.5.
   Interrogative mood, in addition to the question word itself, has two particles that bracket
the clause, te 'INITIAL QUESTION MARKER' , for all types of questions and a final question marker
which is one of:
           ne               INFORMATION FINAL QUESTION MARKER (example 4.42)
           e                YES/NO FINAL QUESTION MARKER (example 4.43)
           bado             ALTERNATIVE QUESTION MARKER (example 4.44)
           fe               CONFIRMATIVE QUESTION MARKER (example 4.45)
  The initial question marker is optional; however, the final question marker is obligatory.
More details of interrogative structure types are found in Chapter 6.

   The initial question marker, te , is used to alert the hearer that a question i s about to be
asked. It is more commonly used within a complex sentence, as in example 4.46, than in
60                                                                                       CHAPTER 4simple sentences. In a sample of 1 94 questions in the corpus of data, te occurred 4 1 times,
that is about 21 % of questions used teo

                 pigs eaten the plants in the garden?
   For imperative , the following particles are clause-final: se (Abun Ji) and the dialectal
variant, tom (Abun Tat) STRONG HORTATIVE as in example 4.47; et MIlD HORTATIVE 4.48, and nde
'PROHlBITIVE' 4.49. The unmarked form, 'BASIC IMPERATIVE' 4.50, is distinguished from
indicative mood by context. For further discussion regarding imperative mood see §6.2.

   Frustrated action mood uses the particle ware, as in example 4.5 1 . The nearest English
equivalent would be 'in vain' , 'to no avail' or 'but without success ' . Its meaning is that an
action was attempted but the goal of the action was not achieved. It is clause-final like other
moods following modal markers. See §6.3 for more details.

                      The Abun language is spoken in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, in the northern area of the Bird's
                    Head Peninsula. The language is spoken in the subdistricts of Sausapor and Mega. It is
                    bordered by several other languages: to the east, Amberbaken (also known as Mpur or
                    Kebar); to the south, Karon Dori (also known as Mare, a dialect of Mai Brat) and Moraid;
                    and to the west, Moi (as seen on Map l.1 below).
                        There are approximately three thousand speakers who live in eighteen villages, ten on the
                     coast and eight in the interior, as weH as in isolated hamlets.
                        There are four identifiable dialects all of which are mutually intelligible, although
                    inteHigibility decreases when greater geographic distance is involved. The names given to the
                    dialects are those used by the speakers themselves and concern the different terms for the
                    first person singular pronoun. Further details foHow in §l.7.","[11, 12, 13]"
"   The primary particle, nde, is used in all types of negation. Not only is it used as the
primary negation particle, but standing alone it simply means ' no ' . When a question is asked
and the response is negative, a simple nde is sufficient in reply. In contrast, the other negative
particle, yo, is used only in conjunction with nde. So it can be said that nde is indeed the
primary or basic negative particle.
  The particle nde is required to form prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions and negative equational sentences (§8. 1 ).",[143]
"
8.2.2 NEGATIVE INFORMATION-SEEKING INrERROGATIVES
   In contrast to positive-negative alternative questions, negative interrogative sentences
seeking information require both negative particles, yo and nde, such as in the following
examples:   8. 1 5 a.    Te     nan     rna     wa      surna ne ?
                IQM    2sGcome for             what    fQv1
                Why have you come?
          b.    Te     nan yo          rna       nde     wa     surna ne ?
                IQM    2SG NEG      come         NEG     for    what         fQv1
                Why didn ' t you come?
   8 . 1 6 a.   Je        u          ana rna       ne?
                person what TOP           come     FQM
                Who has come?
          b. Je      u       ana yo                rna        nde     ne ?
             person which TOP NEG                  come NEG           fQv1
             Who has not come?
     Take note that the interrogative mood also has two bracketing particles, te the initial
question marker and ne the final question marker. The bracketing required to negate a clause
falls within the bracketing required to form an interrogative construction, as seen in example
8 . 1 5b.",[148]
"   In answer to a question like that in example 7 . l 3 above, one may answer including either
of the aspect markers, re or t6. The actual answer given by the speaker was:   7.2 1        An    ki      do         ""Nde reo      An    bi       nggon   jam   nde to. ""
                3sG say COM        NEG    PERF 3sG PERF wife                  know NEG  INCAM
                He said, ""No. His wife does not yet know"".
  He wanted to emphasise two aspects here. Firstly, his wife did not know and this 'not
knowing' persisted (nde re) and secondly, she did not yet know and this 'not knowing' still
continued, or, in other words, the 'knowing' was not yet completed (nde t6).
   According to Comrie ( 1 976:24), languages may combine several aspects where they are
compatible and there are formal means to do so. Abun speakers may follow t6 with re, as
seen in example 7.22, but no evidence has been found of re followed by t6 or combinations
of t6 and it, or re and it.",[139]
"
6.1 .4.4 TOPICAUSATION OF INFORMATION-SEEKlNG QUESTIONS
   Information-seeking questions, like indicative sentences, can be topicalised (see §4.7.2). In
these forms the question word is followed by the demonstrative-focus word (or topicaliser),
anato, as in example 6.54. The use of this form brings sukjan 'plants' into greater focus or
emphasis than the non-topicalised forms, as in 6.55 and 6.56.
   6.54      Te suk-jan        u         anato nan jan               ne ?
             lQM NOM-plant     which FOC          2SG plant          �
             Which plants are the ones that you planted?
   6.55      Te nan jan        suk-jan        u        ne ?
             IQM 2sG plant      oM-plant      which    �M
             Which plants did you plant?
   6.56      Nan jan      surna ne ?
             2sG plant what �M
             What did you plant?
   In a sample of 1 27 information-seeking questions, 25% were topicalised.
   In Abun the constituents of a sentence that may be topicalised in questions are the subject.
Even though the subject is the topic, it may receive extra focus by the use of anato, as in
example 6.57 and object, as in 6. 54.
   6.57      Te je        u        anato      ndar    ne      jau     ne?
             IQM person which FOC             dog     DEf     bite    �M
             Who was it that the dog bit?
   Other constituents such as location in example 6.58 cannot be topicalised.
   6.58      *Mo u           anato    nan ontu                   ne ?
             LOC which       FOC      2SG umbilical.cord         �M
MARKED MOODS                                                                                 1 156. 1 .5 USAGE OF INTERROGATIVE SFNTENCES
   Abun has no special form for rhetorical questions. Instead interrogative sentences can be
used in a rhetorical sense; that is, the speaker not only is sure of the answer, but also requires
no answer. So on some occasions, although the structure is interrogative, the illocutionary
force i s not. This is plain in narrative texts where the speaker continues after asking a
'question' because the answer is obvious. Examples taken from text are:(i) a negative statement
   6.59      Ii da              sok ari              sarewo Yefun ne      sa u   ne ?
             ISG even. though enter church.service but        God OEM like which �
             1 . Even though I went to church, what was God like?
             2. Even though I went to church, I couldn't understand who God was.
   6.60      Ii     yo     bi     os  wa      ji      kern rno Dorn  nde
             I SG   NEG    POSS   way for     I SG    live in Sorong NEG
             be      je         u        anato rnewa       ji    ne ?
             later person which FOC              care.for ISG �
             1 . I had no way I could live in Sorong, who could take care of me?
             2. I couldn ' t live in Sorong because there was no one there who would have
                 taken care of me.(ii) an exclamation expressing surprise or even disgust
   6.6 1     An     jirnnot ware an          ki      do     ""Surna ben j i     anato
             3sG    think   FRUS 3sG         say     that   what   do   ISG    FOC
             ji      sern   rno      nat   re    e     ji   i     sare      ne ? ""
             ISG sleep we            place this and ISG sick like. this �
             1 . He thought about it with no success, ""What ever made me sleep in this place
                and get sick like this?""
             2. He couldn't work out what made him sleep in a place like that that made him
                so sick.
   Example 6.6 1 comes from a narrative, and at this point there was no interaction with
anyone. The speaker was really disgusted with himself for doing such a stupid thing. In
English we often ask ourselves, ""Why did I do such a stupid thing?"", in the sense, ""What a
stupid thing for me to have done !"" So the semantic force of this interrogative structure is not
to ask a question but to make a statement expressing disgust.(iii ) a statement expressing uncertainty
   This example comes from a narrative where the speaker was not interacting with anyone.
  6.62       An      ki    do     "" Ye      ne    Yesugote y e      Waropen bado ? ""
             3sG say that person that Irianese               person Waropen A(J.1
             1 . He said, ""Was that Irianese person a Waropen person?""
             2. I think he said that the Irianese person was a Waropen person.
1 16                                                                                 CHAPTER 6
(iv) a rebuke or negative command
   6.63     Nan nok         wa suma ne ?
            2sG afraid for what FQM
            1 . Why are you afraid?
            2. Don ' t be afraid!
    The above type of interrogative structure is a rhetorical question found in cases where the
speaker continues, not waiting for an answer. In the context of example 6.63, people said
(literally), ""Why are you afraid? Go on inside !"" In saying this they effectively rebuked the
one who was being slow about doing what he should have done.(v) a condition
   6.64      Yonatan    bi     ai     ndo   do    U Te more nu    sugit yo
             Yonatan    poss   father asked that IQM   here house food a
            yen bra jamsem yo              bado ? Ge         ber men git sore "".
            3PL boil cassava some AQv1               then    later I PL eat just
            Yonatan' s father said, ""If there is a restaurant here that boils cassava then let's
            just go and eat there"".
6.2 lMPERATlVES
   Imperative sentences convey a request, command, order, suggestion, instruction or an
entreaty. Sadock and Zwicky ( 1985: 1 7 1 ) note that since human social life so frequently
consists of activities of requesting, commanding and the like, no language (it seems) lacks a
form dedicated to imperative sentences. This is indeed true for Abun.
   First we will make some general typological comments about Abun imperative sentences
in relation to universal observations (§6.2. 1 ). This will be followed by a discussion of the
types of imperative sentences found in Abun consisting of the basic imperati ve type (§6.2.2),
a group of two types that may be called hortative (§6.2.3), and another type labelled
prohibitive (§6.2.4).
6.2. 1 lMPERATIVETYPOLOGY ANO ABUN
   Because the imperative mood is basically connected with the second person and relates to
an action to be performed in the immediate future, the second person pronoun, tense and
aspect distinctions are usually absent because they are implied. For this reason, verbs in the
imperative mood in many languages are in their most basic form. Indeed, Lyons ( 1 977: 746)
points out that in many languages imperative sentences are characterised by a change in the
form of the main verb of the sentence to its most simple form. However, in Abun, the form
of the verb is exactly the same as for declarative and interrogative moods. On the other hand,
consistent with most languages, tense and aspect distinctions, which are normally expressed
by adverbs and particles in Abun, are not found in imperative sentences. Instead Abun uses
optional particles to show strength of imperatives. These occur clause-finally.
   According to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985: 1 73), the removal of the subject pronoun and/or
verbal concord affix i s amazingly common. Abun, however, does not allow the removal of
MARKED MOODS                                                                                   1 17the subject in imperative sentences. On the contrary, subject is obligatory in all types of Abun
speech acts.","[126, 127, 128, 129]"
"
8 . 1 THE USE OF nde   As indicated earlier, the simplest negative sentence is just the negative reply to a question,
'Nde ' . In this section, types of negative structures that require the use of nde without yo are
discussed. These types of structure are: prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions, and negative equational sentences.",[144]

   In Abun, the constituent termed mood is an element of the clause expressed through the
means of a clause-final particle. The indicative mood is unmarked. One interesting feature of
the mood particles is the use of two particles as a linked pair to indicate interrogation. In a
simi lar way, negation of indicative sentences uses a linked pair of particles. In Abun, the
strategy of using two particles (as opposed to one) is for the purpose of delineating
constituent boundaries. Thus the constituent 'interrogative' is marked by two particles, one
termed the initial question marker (IQM), occurring clause-initially and the other, the final
question marker (FQM), which ends or closes the interrogative. In modem usage the initial
question marker te appears to be optional, perhaps influenced by the national language,
Indonesian, which does not possess such a particle. The FQM differs according to the type of
interrogati ve.
   A table of the eight mood particles is listed below. For further information about mood
particles listed here see §6.

3 .4.6 INTERJECTIONS
   There are several interjections in Abun, such as mban! 'expression of surprise/alarm' (for
example, when a coconut falls nearby); mara! 'expression of disgust' (for example, when
someone doubts the integrity of another person, this interjection would begin a defence); and
bei! 'expression of surprise ' . According to Schachter ( 1 985: 58), ""The class of interjections
often includes words which are phonologically distinctive"". However, in contrast to this,
those interjections observed so far fit within the regular phonological patterns of the language.
                                           CHAPTER 4
                                   CLAUSE STRUCTURE   The focus of thjs chapter is the structure of an Abun main clause. Firstly, some comments
are made about the core grammar and grammatical relations (§4. 1 ) followed by a note on
how the grammatical relations hierarchy relates to Abun (§4.2). A discussion of clause types
(§4.3), peripheral constituents, which are labelled here adjuncts (§4.4), and clause-final
particles (§4.S) completes the picture of the Abun verbal main clause. In §4.6, Abun verbless
clauses are djscussed.
   A feature of Abun clauses is their fairly rigid word order, especially in the core, but also in
the periphery. The acceptable variations are limited. There are several syntactic information­
packaging options in Abun clauses such as de-focusing, topicalisation and cleft-like
constructions, which are discussed in §4.7.","[58, 59, 60]"
"   9.37      Yan gato bi   lm     mo Arlince ne                an     mu
             Yan REL  POSS mother exist Arlince DEr            3SG    go
             kagit kampung reo
             from village   this
             Yan, whose mother is Arlince, he went from this village.
   This construction although possible is not common. It is most likely to be used in
response to a question. If a question was asked, 'Which Yan are you talking about?' a reply
such as Yan gato bi im mo Arlince ne ' Yan whose mother is Arlince' is common.
However, this structure within a full sentence is not preferred. Example 9.38 below would
not be acceptable.
   9.38      *Harun gato bi  ai     mo Sorom kem su j i bi
             Harun  REL POSS father exist Sorom live with IsG POSS
             im      do-wok '       tepsu an      bi     pa    kon.
             mother class-small j ust.as 3sG poss child cook
             Harun, whose father is Sorom, lives with my aunt as their adopted child.
   Instead this statement would be given as:
  9 . 39     Harun gato Sorom bi  pa               ne kem su . . .
             Harun REL Sorom poss child            DEr  live   with
             Harun, who is Sorom' s child, lives with . . .
   Therefore, within a full o r complete sentence a s in example 9.39, i t is not acceptable to
relativise the possessor. In an incomplete or partial sentence, such as an answer to a question
or as a modification of a noun in apposition to a full clause (such as example 9.37) a
relativisation of the possessor is possible. It is possible to relativise the possessor only in
limited circumstances. It is not preferred as part of a complex sentence. This could be said to
confirm that the possessor position is the lowest on the hierarchy.",[169]

3.4.4 PROFORMS
   Abun has three subclasses of proforms                including      pronouns,      prosentences,     and
interrogative proforms.
    There is only one set of pronouns in Abun which is used for subject, object and possessor
and is listed in Table 3 . 1 4 below. There is significant dialectal variation, with the three main
dialects being distinguished by their first person singular pronoun. In addition to dual forms
trial and greater are possible. Thus me-ka-gri ' we three' or an-ka-at 'they four' are
frequently used in story telling.

                  non-human         i-
   In addition to the above pronouns, Abun has a reciprocal pronoun, yu, and two reflexive
forms, dakai and wadigan. These modify the appropriate pronoun above and yu. For further
details regarding the distinction between these two see §5.2. 1 . The same form of this
pronoun is used for all persons.
   The Abun prosentence subclass consists of one member, which i s also the pri mary
negation particle, nde. This word is used to answer questions with a 'no' and, as such, is
equivalent to a negative sentence. Affirmative answers use an echo system rather than a
prosentence (see §6. 1 for more details).
   There are three members of the interrogative proforms subclass, namely u 'which ' ,
suma 'what' and o t 'how many ' . These forms combine with other words to create
interrogative expressions such as, mo u 'ux: which: where' and kam ot 'day how .many:
when' . For more detail s see §6. 1 .4.","[55, 56, 57]"
"27     An alternative analysis is that these are treated as serial verbs.
28     It could be stated that the fact that subjectless constituents do not exist elsewhere in the language
       does not in itself represent an argument that they do not exist in the constructions shown here. It
       needs to be pointed out that in Abun there is not sufficient syntactic evidence to posit that a
       subjectless subordinate clause exists as a real constituent in the language, either in these cases or
       anywhere else. The only reason for positing that such a constituent may exist here is not due to
       syntactic evidence but rather to accommodate a certain theoretical position. In order to master a
       second language properly the language learner must not only master vocabulary but also master the
       syntactic patterns that are found in the language. In order to speak Abun effectively it is not
       necessary to include in one's inventory of syntactic patterns a reduced clause of this kind. It seems
       strange to add to the list of Abun clause types a reduced clause which does not have any specific
       syntactic marking to indicate its separate existence. This raises the question of whether certain
       clause types should be added to the language' s inventory when the only basis for doing so is
       theoretical rather than observed syntactic evidence.
COMPLEMENf ClAUSES                                                                           185   There is one other means o f syntactic evidence to indicate that only one constituent, a
complement clause which functions as object, follows these predicate types. It is possible to
restructure some of these sentences so they can be stated as cleft sentences. For example
10.63 repeated here as 1 0.7 1 can be restructured to approximate a cleft sentence.
   1 0.7 1   An      i-wa           ji    si    an rnu rno nggwe.
             3sG be.happy-TRs l sG with 3sG go to             garden
             She wanted me to go with her to the garden.
   1 0.72    Su-ga          an    i-wa         anato j i s i    an       rnu rno nggwe.
             thing-sPEC 3sG       be.happY-TRS FOC    l SG with 3SG     go to     garden
             What she wanted was that I go with her to the garden.
   Later in § 1 2.6 these types of constructions will be discussed further. However it is clear
from example 10.72 that, while Abun does not have a passive construction through which
the object can be identified, the means of focus that is possible by the noun modifier anato
serves the same function. If the question 'What was it that she wanted?' was asked the
answer would be as in 1 0.72. The object of the predicate i-wa is clearly located after the
focus particle anato and it is obviously the entire clause. Therefore it is preferable to analyse
these complement clauses as the object of the main clause rather than positing the alternative
structure discussed here.
   Noonan ( 1 985: 1 33) makes the claim that ""All languages have an s-like indicative
complement type, and all languages have some sort of reduced complement type in
opposition to the indicative"". In comparing languages he posits a minimum of these two
complement types which constitute the smallest kind of complement system that is found in
the world's languages. According to his definition, Abun has only one complement type, not
two, since all Abun complement clauses are indicative clauses. However, we would like to
suggest that Abun does have two complement types-those with complementisers and those
without (in this work termed 'embedded' ). The basis for these distinctions is not found
within the complement clause itself. This has been the basis on which Noonan and others
have made their division of complement types. This basis has come from the alteration in
structure of the complex sentence of which the complement is a part. External rather than
internal considerations have been the basis for the division of Abun complement types. In
this way Abun is different in its complement structure to other languages that have been
described.","[196, 197]"

3.4.5 PARTICLES
  There are several subclasses of particles including a topicaliser particle, a particle used for
negation, three aspect, three modal and eight mood particles. The term particle is used to
mean a free form word that does not take any type of inflection. It is an invariant form that
never occurs in an environment where i t could be described as 'bound' .
   The topicaliser or focus particle is ana(to), which always occurs after the subject and
before the verb. See §4.7.2 for more details about the use of this particle.
   There is one negative particle, nde, which occurs after the predicate and before aspect
mood or modal particles. Used on its own it may answer a question in the negative. To form
the indicative negative this particle along with the predicate marker yo form a linked pair of
particles. These particles jointly bracket the constituent 'predicate' . Used in a sentence without
yo, nde makes the mood of the sentence prohibitive. For further details see §8.
   If a clause includes aspect, modal or mood particles, those particles will always be in
clause-final position in that order. The particles may occur after either the verb, the object, the
indirect object or an adjunct, depending on the constituents of the particular clause concerned.
Also, these particles are not clitics in that the particle takes equivalent phonological stress
along with every other word in the clause.

    Examples 1 1 .27 and 1 1 .28 above show hypothetical situations which could happen at any
future undisclosed time. These hypothetical situations could aptly be translated by
'whenever' . Thus yo, here translated as 'when ' in English, could also be translated as 'if' for
these irrealis sentences. Givon ( 1 990:830) notes that, ""In many languages, irrealis
conditionals are marked identically as irrealis when-clauses, so that the slight difference
between them is inferred from the context."" This is the case for Abun. Examples 1 1 .30 and
1 1 .3 1 below are irrealis conditional sentences and are marked by yo to express the
conditional relationship between the clauses.
   1 1 .30    Nan {           yo               men     to     Barbarina       si      nan     kem.

              B ut if the young men haven't seen anything, (then) they order. ..
   It was stated earlier that Abun has no single lexical item to represent a conditional
relationship between clauses. The tensed conjunctions sa and yo can be used to express this
relationship but often no conjunction will be used at all. In the following example the first
clause expresses a current state so that the time setting is neither past nor future. Here neither
sa nor yo have been used to link the two clauses. There is no l inker at all . The two clauses are
juxtaposed and the conditional relationship that is expressed is inferred by the hearer from the
known context.

    The conjunction yo is also used to link other clauses that could be described as
' hypothetical alternatives' . Abun has no single lexical item that represents alternation such as
the English 'or' . In questions often bado 'ALTERNATIVE QUESTION MARKER' is used. In a complex
sentence involving several alternatives yo may be used where the situation is not fully known
and therefore hypothetical in some way. In such instances yo is best translated as 'whether' .

   It has been shown that yo is used within sentences to express the future time setting of
those sentences, to express possible events or hypothetical ones and also to express a
conditional relationship between two clauses. It can also be used to link clauses where the
event expressed by the second clause is a compulsory consequence of the event expressed by
the first. These types of sentences are always hypothetical in nature, yet the additional link of
consequence is contained within the meaning of the complex sentence. For example:
   1 1 .34   Ye-to           gwa yewon dabe yo,                ye         ne

"
1 2.7 NEGATIVE CONJUNCTIONS
   The final group of Abun conjunctions all contain the negative particle onde. When a single
clause is negated in Abun it is negated by means of two particles which bracket the verb
phrase. So clause negation has the structure:
                                 SUBJECT + yo + VERB PHRASE + nde
   But there is another type of negation in Abun which occurs on the level of the complex
sentence. Within a complex sentence whatever is expressed by the first clause can be negated
by means of onde. Onde always occurs together with some other conjunction. These create a
group of conjunctions which are termed 'negative' conjunctions. Sentences that use these
negative conjunctions have the following structure:
                             CLAUSE 1 + onde-CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 2
   Semantically this is most basically expressed as 'not clause one, clause two ' . It has been
claimed earlier in this chapter that Abun complex sentences show much influence from
Papuan languages. It is interesting to note that Barai, an unrelated Papuan language, also has
two distinct means of negation. In the words of Foley and Van Valin ( 1 984: 1 92), one of
these ""ba ... negates the entire clause and roughly means 'it is not the case that' .. .it is the only
element that ever follows the verb in heavily verb-final B arai"". The fact that this form has an
equivalent meaning to the Abun onde is another factor which confirms the influence of
Papuan languages on Abun syntax.
   Table 1 2 .4 below lists all the negative conjunctions. Fuller explanations and examples of
each are given afterwards.
                                TABLE 1 2.4: NEGATIVE CONJUNCTIONS                         C ONJUNCTION                    MEANING

   The negative meaning of onde can be clearly understood when it is part of the contrastive
conj unction onde-wo. Any clauses linked by onde need to be understood semantically in the
following way:        CLAUSE 1                       onde-                                CLAUSE 2
        event asserted                 not the case, instead                reallaltemative event
The event expressed by clause one is stated positively; it is not marked as negative within the
clause by means of the negative particles yo and nde. However, whatever was asserted by
clause one is not the case, and so this clause is negated by means of onde. Therefore the
event expressed by clause two is, in the speaker' s opinion, the real situation. If the clause i s
linked b y a negative conj unction other than ondewo, the event expressed b y clause two
indicates an alternative situation to that expressed in clause one. Thus ondewo links clauses
expressing a false and true contrast. For example:
   1 2.77    Yenggras      njim    do  re   ndar       syut       nok      ondewo
             elders        think   COM here dogs       bark.at    wild.pig but.really
             ndar syut     pa       kaiyi.
             dogs bark.at child actual
             The old men thought that the dogs were barking at a wild pig but actually the
             dogs were barking at a child.
   1 2.78    An     ki     do Sem       ana ben  brek            ne      ges    ondewo

             an    dakai ben      ges.
             3SG self        make fall
             He said that Sem was the one who made the plate fall but really he himself
             caused (it) to fall.
(ii) onde-sa 'otherwise (would)'
   Onde-sa is made up of the sentence negator onde and the realis or past time conjunction
sa. The combined meaning of the two creates a conjunction that is counterfactual. Again the
structure of the sentence using onde-sa is broken down semantically below to explain clearly
the meaning of these types of sentences.
       CLAUSE 1                     onde-sa                             CLAUSE 2
       event asserted               (if) not so, instead                different outcome, past
   The event expressed by clause one is given in the indicative. These events may or may not
be true. The second clause describes a situation that would arise in the event that clause one
was negated. Onde represents the negation. Sa indicates a past time setting to both the event
and the outcome described. In this type of sentence both the event and the outcome may refer
to hypothetical situations. Even so, sa indicates that whether hypothetical or not the events in
question would have occurred at some time in the past, rather than in the future. In these
sentences onde links clauses in a counterfactual manner giving the meaning: 'If the events
expressed by clause one had not happened then the events expressed by clause two would
have ' . Since Abun has no English equivalent to the conditional 'if' , this meaning is merely
for the purposes of good translation. However ""Counter-fact propositions need not be
226                                                                                    CHAPTER 12associated with conditional ADY clauses."" (Giv6n 1 990:83 1 ), as is the case here. That is to
say, a counterfactual proposition does not need to be marked by overt conditional means
only. A language may use other means to indicate this. For example:
   1 2.79     Su-gane men ku           Ron onde-sa,              men yo       ku sugum
              with-that 1 PL meet      Ron otherwise-REAL        1 PL NEG     get money
              wa men ma            nde.
              for 1 PL come NEG
              1 . At that time we met Ron, otherwise we would not have had money to come
                 (here).
              2. If, at that time, we hadn't met Ron we would not have had money to come
                 here.
   In the sentence above clause one expresses a factual situation which did actually
occur-the participants met a man who gave them money. Clause two expresses a
hypothetical situation which would have arisen if they had not received the money-they
would not have been able to pay for fares to return to their village. The usage of sa indicates
to hearers that this speculation i s about past events. Example 1 2.80 below i s similar. It
contains the variant onde-sor-sa. This adds a component of meaning similar to 'it was j ust as
well that...'
   1 2.80     Nu-won       ga mo A iwom ndo, ndo sato         yewon yo                        gu

              RER.. again NEG but otherwise-just-REAL later people kill RER.. still
              1 . It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
                  in that the shamans didn't kil l each other any more. B ut otherwise they would
                  stil l be killing each other.
               2. It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
                    in that the shamans didn ' t kill each other any more. B ut if not they would
                    still be killing each other.
   In the preceding two examples the meaning component that sa adds to these clauses is
that of its primary meaning-it is functioning as a tensed conjunction indicating past time.
The following example differs from 1 2 .79 and 1 2.80 above in that here sa is functioning
according to its secondary usage-it adds the notion of 'subjunctive' to the first clause. Abun
has no lexical equivalent to the subjunctive 'should' . Therefore the translation of 1 2. 8 1 below
indicates this.

   Example 1 2. 8 1 above is a reprimand by an older woman to certain young people. A s
such it could also be translated a s 'Would that you had all rowed that canoe' . This also is

way.46 As such this clause refers to a hypothetical past event. What actually happened in this
case was that one young man was left to row the canoe alone against a strong wind.'
    Because Abun has no morpheme to represent a hypothetical situation such as the English
'if' , it is only by context and knowledge of the events described that hearers encode what is
hypothetical and what is fact. The function of onde is to negate the contents of the preceding
clause. On its own it does not attach truth value to these clauses. Therefore when onde is part
of the conj unction onde-wo, it is used to express the semantic notion of 'contrary to
expectation ' . When part of the conjunctions onde-sa and onde-yo, onde i s used to express
the notion of 'contrary to fact' .
(iii) onde-yo 'otherwise (will)'
   Onde-yo differs in meaning from onde-sa in the matter of time setting only. In clauses
linked by onde-sa, the 'tensed' conjunction sa indicates to hearers that the time setting of the
sentence and its contents are in the past, events described therein have already occurred.
However, when the conj unction changes to yo, hearers understand that the event expressed
by the second clause is non-past. These events have not actually occurred and may be
hypothetical in nature also.

                  biscuits !
  Givon ( 1990: 8 3 1 ) makes the following comments about counterfactual conditionals
which are relevant to this discussion of negative conjunctions.
       In addition to the subordinators that (may) mark them, counterfact clauses tend
       to be marked, cross-linguistically, by a combination of two semantically
       conflicting verbal inflections:
       (a) A prototypical realis operator, such as past, perfective or perfect: and,
       (b) A prototypical irrealis operator, such as: future, subjunctive, conditional
           or a modal.
   According to Givon this 'semantic conflict' arises if a clause is marked with both a realis
and irrealis 'operator' or one clause may be marked realis and the other irrealis. This situation
may arise as given in example 1 2.83 below. The first clause is marked by the perfect aspect
marker reo However, the usage of onde-yo in sentences is very similar to the usage of the
46    Just as Abun has no word for the modal 'should' neither does it have an equivalent to the
      subjunctive verb 'wish' . The subjunctive usage of sa is the nearest Abun equivalent for expressing
      this notion.
228                                                                                  CHAPTER 12conj unction yo on its own. If a sentence describes a predictive or procedural situation, then
onde-yo is used.
   1 2.83    Yen       gu     or           re, onde-yo             ye       si      rna
             people    kill   completely   PERF otherwise-IRR      people   go.with come
             rno nu       de, yen         bi    n                nai.
             to house side people give ginger.root 10
             They would kill off (all those people). If this is not possible the (young) people
             with them (the older shamans) will come to the side of the house (and) give
             ginger root to (the people they want to kill).
    Onde should not be understood as a negative conditional such as the English ' unless ' . It is
possible to give an alternative translation for example 1 2.83 above as 'Unless you sweep up
that mess down there, you won't get any biscuits ! ' However, as seen in examples 1 2.77 and
1 2.78 above, which use onde-wo, onde does not always have the meaning of a negative
conditional. When used as part of onde-wo it has the meaning of negative contrast. Usage of
onde indicates some kind of semantic contrast between the propositions involved. This i s
achieved b y negation o f the content o f the first clause.
(iv) onde-bere 'otherwise.cERT'
   This conjunction differs from the others by the addition of the time word bere
'FlITURFfIater' . There are several variants of bere which need to be explained. These three
variants concern the differences in the way Abun speakers view future time. These variants
are:
                       ber     soon, shortly
                       bere    later, definitely�will
                       be      later, likely/probably� could    All these variants could be translated as 'later' or 'will' in regards to future time. Ber is
used to indicate that the future time specified is in the near future. However, with bere and
be the matter of future time proximity is unspecified. What is specified is the degree of
certainty that the speaker attaches to the future event described. Hence, if the speaker feels
that the event is a certainty then bere is used, meaning 'definitely will ' . If the speaker
attaches less certainty to the future event taking place then be is used, meaning 'probably
will' or 'could'. Both these time words can be joined to onde to create counterfactual
conjunctions. These conjunctions link events that are non-past or future time in the same way
as the conjunction onde-yo. By choosing onde-bere or onde-be rather than onde-yo the
speaker adds the semantic element of 'degree of certainty' which is not present in the case of
onde-yo. In regard to counterfactuals Givon ( 1 990: 832) notes that ""many languages allow
further gradation, most particularly of events/states that are j udged to be unlikely but not
altogether impossible"". The gradations referred to here are from possibly true to not true.
The gradation expressed in Abun is in the other direction, from probable to certain . Abun has
no adverb or modal form which means 'definitely' or 'certainly' . Thus these concepts have
been incorporated into these future time words. Examples showing the use of onde-bere and
onde-be are given below:

             2. If you don' t go and get it I could beat you !
(v) onde-ge 'otherwise-then'
   This final counterfactual conjunction does not indicate time setting of the clauses involved.
The conjunction ge 'then' is joined to onde to indicate sequence of events. It is not as
frequently used as the other counterfactuals. The example below has several variant
translations since the negative contrast indicated by onde can be rendered in several ways in
English.

                 her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), otherwise then they will bring her to the

             2. That woman, (that) he had committed adultery with, like that, they will kill
                her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), failing that then they will bring her to the
                 shaman-house.
             3. That woman, (that) he had committed adultery with, like that, they will kil l
                 her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), if this is not possible then they w i l l bring
                 her to the shaman-house.
  This concludes the discussion of negative conjunctions and it concludes the discussion of
Abun conjunctions covered in this work.

3.3.2 NOUNS
   Within the noun class there are five distinct subclasses: proper nouns, common nouns,
compound nouns, body parts, and relator nouns, the last two of these subclasses being closed
ones. Proper nouns, which together with pronouns always directly precede hi 'possessive
linker' when hi co-occurs, consist of words such as names of people or places. They are
distinguished from common nouns in that they never occur after the possessive linker. The
subclass of body parts occurs in inalienable possessive constructions and is j uxtaposed to the
possessor; see § S .3 for more details.
   Nouns are in general a single morpheme, but can also consist of multiple morphemes.
Multiple morphemes are derived from single morpheme nouns or some other fonn classes
through the processes of affixation and compounding.
  There are three prefixes on nouns; a norninali ser, suk- ; a personaliser, ye- ; and i-, a
possessive pronoun prefix for non-human referents, which replaces the whole of a non­
human whole-part relationship in compound nouns. They are listed in Table 3.3 below :                                    TABLE 3.3: ABUN NOUN PREFIXFS                          Prefix            Type                Usage

   Since both suk and ye also occur as free forms, an alternative analysis would be to
describe them as being used i n fanning noun compounds. 2 However, the choice of prefix is2    It appears that this dilemma is common; to quote Anderson ( 1 985:45), ""The line between
     compounding and stem modification is not always easy to draw ... but this is not a matter of major
     importance since the division is primarily a matter of convenience"".

information. Furthermore, affixes may also exist as free forms, such as in in the English

10.2.5.1 LEXICAL RESTRICTIONS
   The limitation of the predicate types which allow negative raIsmg involve further
restrictions for Abun. Abun, in common with the languages of the Papuan region, does not
have a wide range of single morpheme vocabulary to indicate states of mind. The verbs
'know ' , 'understand' , 'hear' and 'believe' may all be expressed by the one verb jam. The
verb 'believe', which may allow negative raising in some languages, does not exist as a
separate lexicon entry in Abun. Another candidate for negative raising is the verb 'want' . The
process of negative raising changes a matrix clause verb 'want' to the negative 'do not want' .
Although it is possible to change the Abun verb lwa 'want' to yo lwa nde 'not want' , the
more usual practice is to use the inherently negative word barilbariwa 'not want' . Because it
is more common for Abun speakers to use bari rather than yo lwa nde, the possibility of
negative raising does not arise due to the choice of negative strategy taken, namely a negative
word rather than a negative particle.",[187]
"   The embedded clause of example 10.40 is in apposition to the object suk 'thjng' . It is an
expansion of the object or gives clear content to it. It is certrunly not common to have a
structure as ful l as this, but 1 0.40 shows that if there is a do-clause it occurs after the object
and indirect object, if these constituents are present. In 1 0.40 the object, here suk 'thjng', is a
generic non-specific noun without any known or specific content until the do-clause is given.
Because the do-clause is a more internally complex constituent than a single noun such as
suk, the placing of the do-clause in sentence-final position, rather than immediately following
the object, is an example of the heavy-to-the-right movement principle. This principle of
word order, evident in many languages, shifts larger complex units to the right, that is
towards the end of the sentence, to reduce burden on the short-term memory (Mallinson &
Blake 1 98 1 : 1 5 1 , 1 56ff).
  Examples 1 0.4 1 , 1 0.42 and 1 0.43 below are also typical of the types of sentence which
contain do-clauses in addition to direct objects.

9.8 NON-RESTRJCfIVE RELA11VE CLAUSES
   Non-restrictive relative clauses are less common than restnctJVe relative clauses. They
have two main structural differences compared with the restrictive clause type. Firstly, the
relative conjunction is to, the general noun subordinating particle. Secondly, all non­
restrictive relative clauses must be closed by the boundary marker, the determiner ne. There
are several reasons for this. The non-restrictive relative clause is structurally different from
the indefinite relative clause in that the determiner is used in the non-restrictive type. In a non­
restrictive relative clause the semantic content 'is presented as a separate piece of information'
(Huddleston 1 984:40 1 ). It is a type of parenthetical insertion not essential to the speaker' s
main communication. It can be easily seen that in Abun the conjunction to and the determiner
ne are the parentheses which bracket the additional information which has been included
within the main clause. So the determiner is an essential element in this clause type because
the hearer must know when the inserted or additional information ends. Hence the behaviour
of the determiner in the non-restrictive relative clauses described here is consistent with its
behaviour as a boundary marker in the restrictive relative clauses described earlier. Example
9.52, given earlier in this chapter as example 9.4, shows how both to and ne bracket
additional information which has been included for the hearers' benefit.
1 62                                                                                             CHAPTER 9     9.52       A n k i nai Martinus to-re    to kra    Domingas

                Dorningas) (whose) name was Simam Yorfen that...
   Examples 9.53 and 9.54 also show the non-restrictive clause type as additional
information.
     9.53       Nan me fen           dik yo to nor ne bur.

                Look at that turtle which is floating (around) down there !

                ANA. eat NOM-eat DEr
                He asked about some (kind of) food, which all of us would eat.
   In example 9.54 there is another structural difference which may occur with this type of
clause. Because the clause is added or non-essential information, the head of the relative
clause has actually been retained within the non-restricting clause so that there is no gap, as
there would be in the restricting kind. In this example the non-reduction strategy is used
rather than the gap strategy. It may be that since this particular relative clause represents
additional, inserted information it shows the potential of inserting an entire rather than a
reduced clause. However this kind of construction has been found only within the non­
restrictive type and is not common.
   There appear to be limitations also as to those pOSitIOns which may be filled on the
Accessibility Hierarchy by the non-restrictive relative clause. It appears that while both a
subject and direct object can be relati vised in this way, positions lower on the hierarchy
cannot. The example below, given as example 9.28 in §9.5. 1 , is a relativisation of a non­
direct object for a restrictive clause. When exactly the same information is presented in a non­
restrictive form, as in example 9.56 below, it actually becomes a relativisation of a subject. I 8
Since the non-restrictive relative clause is the less frequent type this restriction is not
surprising.

10.4.4 KNOWLEDGE PREDICATES
   The predicate jam 'knowlhear/understand' also may be considered a Type 3 predicate in
that it may occur with or without a complementiser. However, this verb is structurally
different in that it does not have an object immediately preceding the complement clause
constituent, as is the case with the other Type 3 predicates. If jam has the meaning 'know ' it
is more likely to use the complementiser in conjunction with the complement clause. If jam29     In particular predicates such as 'know' , 'lie' and 'call' which Giv6n terms 'Perception-Cognition­
       Utterance' predicates 'no co-reference with any argument in the main clause' is required in English
       (Giv6n 1 993: 1 6).
COMPLEMENT CUUSES                                                                                       1 89has the meaning 'hear' it appears not to use the complementiser. The following examples
illustrate these possibilities:
   10.81     Ji    jam k w e       mbrur kwe-nat        kra            kagit as        ma   it.
             l sG hear wood snap tree-leaves crackle from path DIR CAM
             I heard wood snapping and leaves crackling coming from the path.
   10.82     An    jam     an      baca   kuru! dik         kuru! dik.
             3sG know 3sG read         letter one letter               one
             She knew (how) to read one letter at a time.
   10.83     Ji    jam     do      sangge nau               re        dam suk- ibit.
             l sG know COM true              palm.wine this also NOM-bad
             I know that it is true, this palm wine is also a bad thing.
   The following example is interesting in that it contains both types of complement clause
within the one sentence. There is an embedded complement clause which i s the object of the
predicate jam 'hear' . This embedded clause contains yet another complement which, in this
case, consists of the complementiser in conjunction with a complement clause.
   1 0. 84   Ji    jam an         ke      it     do     ""yesyim yesyim nan kas                    kekro "".
             l SG hear 3sG call.out CAM COM friend             friend             2SG   run       quickly
             I heard him calling out, ""Friend! Friend! Run quickly ! ""
10.5 MORE ON MANIPULATIVE PREDICATES
   Earlier in § 1 O.3 manipulative predicates which made use of the suffix -gat were
discussed. These predicates did not make use of the complementiser and the complements
were analysed as embedded objects. However, the manipulative verb ben 'do/make' was not
discussed because it is considered to be a predicate or a different type. Frequently ben has the
meaning of 'do' and so cannot be considered manipulative. B ut when ben has the meaning
of 'make' it can be used as a manipulative predicate. With this verb, as with other
manipulative predicates, the complementiser i s never used. The following examples are
typical:
   1 0.85    Nan m e      su-ga        ben      an     bi        pa       i    ne.
             2sG see thing-REL make 3sG ross child                        sick DEI'
             You see the thing that has made (his) child sick.
   10.86     An    ben     motor ne       kru    reo
             3sG make motor that          sink PERF
             He made that motor sink.
    These complements have a similar structure to those that were termed predicate Type 2. In
keeping with the structural analysis discussed earlier, here also the entire complement clause
is considered to be the object of the main clause.
   Since examples from all of the predicate types have been discussed fully, this concludes
the discussion of Abun complement clauses.

                                  ADVERBIAL CLAUSES1 1 . 1 lNTRODUCfION
   Various terms are used to describe how, within a single sentence, clauses interact to form
a meaningful unit. Terms such as 'interclausal coherence' (Givon 1 990), 'relationships
within the clause complex' (Halliday 1 985) and even 'clause combining' (Matthiessen &
Thompson 1 988) are among recent descriptions of what has been traditionally termed
subordination. Traditionally, as Thompson and Longacre ( 1 985: 1 72) state, three types of
subordinate clause have been distinguished:
      those which function as noun phrases (called complements) [=noun clauses],
      those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative clauses), and those which
      function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (called adverbial
      clauses).
Relative clauses and noun clauses have been described in the earlier Chapters 9 and 10. In
this chapter we will begin a discussion of the third kind of subordinate clause, ' adverbial
clauses' , as they are found in Abun.
   Adverbial subordinate clauses are said to modify a sentence in the same way that an
adverb modifies a verb. Since the sentences that contain these subordinate clauses consist
minimally of two clauses, one clause could be termed the Head and the other the Modifier
(Halliday 1 985 : 1 92). Usually one clause, often termed the main clause, is said to be
grammatically 'free' or independent. As such it can stand on its own as a single clause. The
subordinate clause is marked in some way, such as by means of verbal inflection, to indicate
that it is 'bound' or dependent and thus cannot stand alone as a single clause. Languages that
permit clauses to be joined in this way normally permit an alternative, termed coordination.
In these cases the clauses, although joined together in some way, may stand on their own as
independent clauses. However, there is another quite different type of ""interclausal
grammatical organization"" (to use Givon ' s terminology 1 990: 864). This type is known as
'clause chaining' (Longacre 1985). Longacre states that languages of the clause-chaining
variety do not offer the grammatical options of subordinate-independent and coordinate
constructions. ''The subordinate/coordi nate distinction is irrelevant [in that there is no choice
between the two] and both are absorbed into the medial/final distinction."" (Longacre
1 985:239). To demonstrate this Longacre gives two English sentences which illustrate the
subordinatelcoordinate options of a language such as English. These sentences, given below
as I L I a and 1 1 . 1 b, would not be syntactically distinct in a language of the clause-chaining
type.

1 2.2 THE PREPOSmON AS CONJUNCfION
     Traditionally prepositions and conjunctions have been considered as two separate word
classes within a language. Recently Huddleston ( 1 984:338) has proposed, at least for
English, that prepositions and subordinating conjunctions be conflated into a single class
( 1 984:338). Some of the reasoning behind this ( 1 984:339) that is applicable to Abun as well
                                               203
204                                                                                      CHAPTER 12as English is that a number of these words ""enter into construction with either an NP or a
clause"". Abun prepositions behave like conjunctions in that a large number of the class of
prepositions have the ability to link a clause to a larger construction. Where they differ from
the other conjunction groups listed in Table 1 2 . 1 is in their ability to embed clauses within
larger units. It will be shown later that other conjunctions in Abun link independent clauses.
These conjunctions have been described as compounding conjunctions because of their
ability to create new forms and extend their range of meaning.
   The following Table 1 2.2 lists those Abun prepositions that behave also as conjunctions.
For some, when they are used to link a clause rather than an NP, their original meaning is
extended.

     The majority of Abun prepositions may act as conjunctions. However, the general locative
mo 'at/in' can be used only in association with the relative clause marker gato. 37 Some of the
prepositions such as subot 'along' karowa 'close to/near' and su 'with' are not commonly
used as conj unctions. Examples of those that are more commonly used, both as prepositions
and as conjunctions, are given below:
(i) ' wa ' 'for/in order to'
     1 2. 1        An    fro       nu     yo    wa      men.
                   3SG prepare house DET(I) for         I PL

                   Marta cut some brer (leaves) and brought them back for us to eat our food on.
  The clause that follows the preposition wa in example 1 2.2 above is considered as a single
constituent. As discussed in Chapter 10 earlier, there is no non-finite form of the verb in
Abun, thus men git sugit mo represents a single clause.","[215, 216]"

5.3 POSSESSNE PHRASES
   Abun has two types of possessive constructions which, in other languages, have been
referred to as 'alienable' and 'inalienable' possession (Crystal 1 985: 1 2). Alienable
possession is that type of possession where the item possessed (hereafter known as
possessum) is seen as having only a temporary or non-essential dependence on the
possessor, such as 'his house' or 'the woman ' s book' . On the other hand, inalienable
possession is where the possessum has a permanent or necessary relationship with the
possessor such as ' her arm ' .
   O f the ten different genitive construction types discussed b y Croft ( 1 990:28-32), Abun
makes use of only two, and uses them to distinguish between alienable and inalienable
possession. The first of these construction types used in Abun is simple j uxtaposition of two
noun phrases; one representing the possessor and one representing the posses sum. This type
of construction is used to form Abun inalienable genitive constructions, as in example 5.69.
Frequently the noun phrases are realised by only a pronoun and a noun, j uxtaposed in that
order, as seen in 5.70.
   5 .69     Ndar sye ne gwes de-dari            fat.
             dog big DEY leg           side-back broken
             Possessor(NP)    Possessum(NP)
             The big dog's back leg is broken .
   5.70      Ji  sy im fat.
             I so arm  broken
             My arm was broken.
78                                                                                    CHAPTER S
   A less common strategy discussed by Croft ( 1 990:32) is that of the use of a linker. He
says, ""The linker is invariant or contrasts only with simple juxtaposition, and functions
merely to link the possessor and head noun grammatical ly"". This is the second type of
genitive construction found in Abun. Abun alienable genitive constructions use this type of
strategy. The possessive marker bi is a linker. It links the possessor and the possessum, as
seen in examples 5.7 1 , 5 .72 and 5.73.
     5.71    Gap sye ne         bi    gan           ge w e kwop reo
             rat   big DEr poss young.one CL two die            PERF
             Possessor                Possessum
             The big rat's two young offspring had died.
     5.72    Ii ben ji      bi   nggwe.
             I SG do   I SG POSS garden
             I made my garden .
     5.73    Ii bi      pa     ge w e mu           mo    nu.
             I sG POSS child CL two go             LOC   house
             My two children went home.
   The noun phrase that represents the possessor undergoes no morphological change when
it is j uxtaposed or linked to the possessum. The possessum likewise is not marked
morphologically in any way. Even the linker, bi, can be shown to be a free form (and will be
in §5.3.2) and thus be considered separate from both the possess urn and the possessor. Abun
possessive phrases syntactically appear to be like coordinate noun phrases, one form
juxtaposed and the other using the linker bi as the coordinating particle, j ust as si is used to
conjoin noun phrases (see §5.7).
   Consistent with the absence of morphological marking in possessive phrases noted here,
Abun does not have a set of possessive pronouns, but uses the same set of pronouns as are
used in all other phrase types. I n contrast to this, in an early cursory analysis of Abun
(previously named Karon), Voorhoeve wrote (in Wurm 1 975:720) that possessive prefixes
had been noted with kinship terms: tabai ' my father' and nambai 'your father' , being cited
as examples. However in slow speech these two forms are: tat bi ai ' ISG POSS father: my
father' and nan bi ai'2SG POSS father: your father' (these phrases are in the Abun Tat dialect,
where tat is ' l sG ' ). No markings are made on either the head or the dependent in possessive
phrases. The same pronouns are employed in possessive phrases as in noun phrases that
occur in subject and object positions, that is, there is no special set of possessive pronouns
in Abun. In this way Abun differs from many other languages.
   The choice of which type of possessive construction to employ is determined by the
lexicon. The inalienable class of nouns which includes body parts, name, and analogously,
the parts of whole-part relationships such as trunk of tree and scales of fish (as discussed in
§3.3.2.3), is restricted and could be considered a closed set. All other nouns belong to an
open set of nouns and include names of places, objects, kinship terms, and advice. Many
languages with the alienable/inalienable distinction include kinship terms in the inalienable
category, but, in Abun, kinship terms are considered to be alienable.
  Now we tum to a more detailed discussion of each of the two types of genitive
constructions, inalienable (§5.3 . 1 ) and alienable (§5.3 .2).
PHRASE SIRUClVRE                                                                           795.3. 1 INALIENABLE POSSESSION
   Abun inalienable possessive phrases may be represented as:                                NP[POSSESSOR] NP[POSSESSUM]
where for pronominal reference the possessor may be replaced by i-, in the case of non­
human referents, or be elided in the case of body part referents.
   In inalienable possession, the possessor and the possessum are simply j uxtaposed as in
example 5.74. This type of possessive construction is used for body parts (such as my arm,
his leg) and more generally for whole-part relationships (such as tree-leaves, deer-meat,
house-opening (doorway)). Also a person' s name is considered as an inalienable possession,
as in 5.75 and 5.76.
   5 .74     Wo Kwai tik Sepenyel gwes.
             fish kwai pull Sepenyel leg
             The Kwai fish pulled Sepenyel's leg.
   5.75      An    gum do Marta.
             3so   name COM Marta
             Her name is Marta.
   5 .76     Marta gum sye do           Yekese.
             Marta name big COM Yekese
             Marta' s surname is Yekese.
   Whole-part relationships, in principle, follow the same structure as inalienable possessive
phrases, and could be analysed as separate words or as compounds. Here they are analysed
as compounds since the possessum is a bound root. It never stands on its own in normal
utterance. It is structurally bound to the preceding word, which represents the ' whole' . S o
rom ' liquid' in example 5 . 77 is bound to gur 'coconut' . No evidence has been found that
words like rom have ever been free forms.
   5.77      Ii     da    gur-rom.
             Iso drink coconut-liquid
             I drink coconut milk.
  The 'whole' may not j ust be a single word, but may also be a noun phrase, for example 'a
young coconut' , that compounds with the bound root, ' liquid' , as seen in example 5.78.
   5.78      da        [gur      bo   dekJ-rom         si     git i-ka       nde e. . .
             drink coconut CL         young-liquid     with eat its-flesh    NEG and
             don ' t drink young coconut milk and eat its flesh, and. . .
     There is one structural difference between inalienable possessive phrases and 'whole-part'
compounds. The difference is that the possessor in the phrase may be elided, whereas in the
compound it cannot. In the latter case, the possessor or 'whole' i s replaced with a prefix i-.
For example, a free form (or the 'whole' in whole-part relationships), such as kwe 'tree' in
example 5.79, can be replaced by the non-human possessive pronoun prefix, i-, as seen in
5 . 80. (See §3.3.2.4 for further discussion about the i- prefix.)
80                                                                                    CHAPTER S
     5.79        Ii     yo       kwe-muk e        kwe-guk.
                 I sG gather tree-trunk and tree-branch
                 I gathered up the trunks and branches.
     5 . 80      Ii     yo       i-muk      e    i-guk.
                 I sG gather its-trunk and its-branch
                 I gathered up the trunks and branches.
   However for body parts the possessum is an unbound form. The i- prefix is not used with
this type of construction when the possessor is elided. So when, say, an arm is referred to on
subsequent occasions, the free form of the posses sum is sufficient and ellipsis of the
possessor is acceptable, as seen in example 5. 8 1 .
     5.81        Men saram men syim . Men so ram syim rna                  nu.
                 IPL shake    I PL   hand I PL shake      hands we         house
                 We shook hands. We shook hands in the house.
     Both body parts and whole-part relationships can be combined as in examples 5 . 82 and
5 . 8 3 . In the latter case, the nails belong to the fingers, which belong to the arm (whole-part
relationships) and the arm belongs to him (body-part relationship).
     5.82        Prisila sap Moses syim-brot taka reo
                 Prisila cut Moses arm-vein apart PERF
                 Prisila had cut Moses' veins in his arm apart.

"   What factors govern the use of the determiner in the relative clause? It is not found in
every instance of a restrictive relative clause. Example 9.22 above has no determiner, in
contrast to example 9.23, in which the restrictive relative clause is closed by the determiner
ne. These two examples differ in two ways. Firstly, in example 9.22 the relativised argument
of the clause has the grammatical relation of subject. In 9.23 the relativised argument has the
grammatical relation of object. Secondly, due to Abun word order the location of the gap in
each restricting clause is different. In example 9.22 the gap is clause-initial since the subject in
Abun is clause-initial. In 9.23 the gap would have been clause-final if the determiner had not
closed the restricting clause. The determiner, by closing the clause, actually assists in locating
the gap, and thereby assists in encoding the grammatical relation of the head.
   The determiner's role in locating the gap is most clearly seen when a direct object is to be
relativised. The determiner ne is used frequently when a direct object is to be relativised, but
not in all instances. To understand how the determiner is used in locating the gap in the
restricting clause, several examples are set out below. In example 9.24 to 9.27 both the head
and the relative conjunction have been highlighted. Further elements within the restricting
clause are underlined to show where the determiner has been omitted. Example 9.24 shows
the determiner as it normally appears, at the end of the relative clause.
   9.24      Men ki nai yu do suk        gato men y e      mo
             I pL say 10 REFL COM things REL IPL difficult exist

             PERF   DEf 1 PL get PERF
             We said to each other that we have the things that we needed.
   In the following examples, 9.25 to 9.27, the omitted direct object is not the final element
of the relative clause, as is the case in 9.24 above, where the determiner ne closes the relative
clause. In examples 9.25 and 9.26 there is a phrase which fol lows the gap, an adjunct phrase
in 9.25 and an indirect object phrase in 9.26.

relative clause within the restricting clause. In English this needs to be translated as 'its
body ' , so that a pronoun replacing the head is now within the restricting clause. In these
instances there is now actually no gap (created by the omission of the head) within the
restricting clause because a word such as ka refers to the head, which in this example has the
grammatical relation of direct object. This creates no need for the use of the determiner ne.","[165, 166]"

1.4 SCOPE OFRESEARCH
   This description is an attempt to provide a comprehensive view of the structure of Abun.
It deals with the phonology, morphology and syntax of the language, including not only
simple clauses but also complex sentences, with attention drawn at many points to
established linguistic universals.
   The present description of basic Abun grammar is based upon data collected during
fieldwork in the Abun area, under the auspices of the cooperative project between
Cenderawasih University of Irian Jaya and the Summer Institute of Linguistics, between
October 1986 and December 1992. The bulk of the data was collected in the villages of
Werur Besar and Sausapor.
   The data used consists of over 35,000 words of transcribed oral texts and 10,000 words of
written Abun text whjch include traditional stories, narratives, dialogues, speeches and
procedural descriptions.",[15]

32   It may appear confusing to use Foley' s definition of the terms REA LIS and IRREALIS since these terms
     are often used to describe not tense, but mood (for example see Giv6n 1 984:255). However,
     Foley's term 'status' which he divides further into 'realis' and 'irrealis' closely approximates the
     semantic distinction between the two postpositional conjunctions sa and yo .
1 94                                                                                      CHAPTER 1 11 1 .2. 1 THE REALIS CONJUNCTION sa
   When a language indicates the temporal setting of events expressed within clauses it may
do so by a formal grammatical category tense, by time words or a combination of both
strategies. In regard to complex sentences, tense as a category may be marked within the
component clauses and particular conjunctions may convey particular 'marked' time
meanings, such as 'before ' , 'after' , 'as ' , and 'while' . The Abun conjunction sa carries the
grammatical information of 'realis', but in relation to specific time concepts is unmarked.
Thus it could be considered a general time subordinator and translated into English as
'when.REALIS' . Sa indicates that the clauses it joins are in realis time setting. By usage of sa
hearers know that the connected events expressed by the clauses are in the past, that they
have already occurred. When clauses are joined by sa, speakers usually pause after sa,
indicating that sa is considered to be part of the preceding clause. Nevertheless sa is still a
conjunction or means of joining two clauses in Abun. It is not possible to end a sentence
with sa. Therefore clauses marked by sa are dependent temporal clauses in the same way as
the English 'when' clause. Sa i s a sentence-medial subordinating conj unction and i s a
constituent of the first clause of a complex sentence which has the following structure:
                                      [CLAUSE 1 + sa] + CLAUSE 2
   The following examples are typical of the way sa is used in Abun:
   1 1 .3     Men kern rno        karnpung     sa            Rahel     hi     ai     farkor an.
              I PL stay i n    village      when.REAL Rachel poss father teach                 3sG
              When we stayed in the village, Rachel ' s father taught her.
   1 1 .4    Mensern rnonekret             Marten sa                Marten rna      karn Selasa.
              I PL sleep there wait.for Marten when.REAL Marten come                day     Tuesday
              We slept there, waiting for Marten and he came on Tuesday.
   As a general time subordinator the range of meanings conveyed by sa is wide. Sa is a
temporal link between clauses and as such can be used to indicate the following range of
meanings:
                  ( 1 ) precedence            whenlbefore
                  (2) subsequence             when/after
                  (3) simultaneity            when/while
                  (4) point coincidence       when/as/, just then
   Giv6n describes a general subordinator such as sa as being semantically ' less marked' .
Conj unctions such as 'before ' , ' after' , 'while' and the like are considered to indicate 'specific
temporal relations' . Therefore Giv6n ( 1 990:828) considers that ""Such less-marked coding
strategy is successful when the semantic specificity of the temporal relation can be inferred
from other features of the two clauses - most commonly from the verb and its tense-aspect.""
Since in Abun the conjunction itself indicates the 'tense' or time setting, it is not necessary to
use other means in order to indicate the specific temporal relation concerned. In the examples
below the extent of temporal relations that sa can convey is shown together with more
specific means of indicating these.

               gri     kwop re.
               three die PERF
               1 . When we carried (them) up to the house, three (fish) had already died.
               2. By the time we reached the house three had already died.
     1 1 .6    n     ma   sa                  an yo ma     nde to.
                I so come when.RFAL           3so NEG come NEG INCAM
               1 . When I came he had not yet arrived.
               2. By the time I came he had not yet arrived.
   The above examples indicate temporal precedence, which in many languages is indicated
by a specific time word meaning 'before ' . Abun has no single word which can be translated
as 'before ' . Instead the negative particle nde combined with the incompletive aspect particle
to are used to indicate 'not yet'. In the above examples there are two further means of
inferring the time relation in addition to the conjunction itself. Example 1 1 .5 has the second
clause marked by the perfect aspect particle) 3 In example 1 1 .6 the temporal precedence
relation is more explicitly marked by nde to 'not yetlbefore' again on the second clause.
These particles may behave as a conjunction without the need for the general subordinator sa.
If used in a clause within a complex sentence nde to has the specific meaning of 'before ' .
For example:
     1 1 .7    Tepsu         gane j i   yo fa i  Apner nde to,   Apner                      dam
               just.like then      I so NEG know Apner NEG INCAM Apner                      also
               yo     fa i      ji    nde.
               NEG know Iso NEG
               1 . At that time before I knew Apner, he did not know me either.
               2. At that time I did not yet know Apner, he did not know me either.","[205, 206, 207]"

1.5 THE GENERAL LINGUISTIC SITUATION
1.5.1 CLASSlFICATION OF THE AEUN LANGUAGE
   The Abun language is classified as a Papuan language by Wurm (1982:206). It belongs to
the small West Papuan Phylum. It is part of the Bird' s Head Superstock, the Central Bird's
Head Stock, and more specifically the North Bird' s Head Family, of which Abun and Madik
are listed as members. While Wurm listed Abun and Madik as separate languages, Berry and
Berry (1987) have presented further information regarding lexical similarities and structural
similarities which indicate that Abun and Madik are dialects of the same language. Therefore,
Abun is a farillly-Ievel isolate in the Central Bird's Head Stock.
4                                                                                    CHAPTER 11.5.2 PAPUAN VERSUS AUS1RONESIAN FFATURfS OFTIIE AEUN LANGUAGE
   Wurm's classification of Abun as a Papuan language seems to be based mainly on its
lexical inventory, with special reference to its set of personal pronouns. There are a
considerable number of Austronesian loan words in the West Papuan (WP) Phylum
languages, and when only non-Austronesian lexical items are compared, the lexical
interrelationship between the WPP languages is much closer. WPP languages in the Bird's
Head contain a small Trans New Guinea (TNG) Phylum lexical element, some of which
may be due to borrowing from the South Bird's Head Stock (which is part of the TNG
Phylum), or may be traces of an old TNG Phylum substratum (Wurm 1 982:204). The
personal pronouns are clearly Papuan, belonging to Wurm's set III (Wurm 1 982:40). Abun
personal pronouns do not distinguish between first person plural inclusive and exclusive,
whereas this is universal for Austronesian languages. Neither are there bound subject
markers on the verb, which is a feature of Austronesian languages. Thus Abun' s pronouns
are more akin to Papuan languages than to Austronesian languages.
   Other Papuan (or perhaps non-Austronesian) features include: no bound subject markers
on the verb, phonologically relevant tone and an irrealis-realis (or non-pasUpast) distinction
which is marked only on complex sentences. Perhaps the most striking Papuan features of
Abun syntax are found at the level of the complex sentence. In some Abun complex
sentences there is no clear syntactic marking to distinguish those clauses which could be
considered subordinate from those which might be termed coordinate. This lack of
subordinate/coordinate distinction is found in Papuan clause-chaining languages. Likewise, in
Papuan clause-chaining languages the semantic notions of temporal sequence and
simultaneity are strongly marked (Longacre 1985:264). These notions also feature strongly in
Abun complex sentences.
   However, Abun has a number of Austronesian features. Most notable is the rigid word
order of svo as distinct from the Papuan SOY word order (Wurm 1 982:64). Other significant
Austronesian features include: a very simple derivational morphology; uncomplicated and
very little inflectional affixation; the common use of particles where verb affixation would be
used in Papuan languages; the use of prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking;
no special sentence-medial verbs; a decimal numbering system unlike the normal Papuan
binary, trinary or quinary systems (Wurm 1 982:64); the existence of reduplicated adverbs;
simple morphophonemic changes and the common use of labialised consonants.
    Despite these features which could make it appear that grammatically Abun has more in
common with Austronesian languages, Abun has some unique features which distinguish it
from both Papuan and Austronesian languages. The use of particles in Abun is so extensive
that it is far greater than in Austronesian languages such as Indonesian. Particles are the main
means of grammatical communication, with affixation playing an extremely minor role. Due
to the lack of affixation in Abun syntax, other grammatical strategies have been developed. In
particular, the use of bracketing (whereby two particles act as boundary markers for a
particular grammatical constituent) serves to identify some important grammatical features,
namely negation, interrogatives and relative clauses. Therefore, Abun does not neatly fit into
either of the neighbouring language classifications, that is Austronesian or Papuan, but shares
features of both.
INTRODUcnON                                                                                51.5.3 THE INFLUENCE OF SURROUNDING lANGUAGES ON ABUN
   The influence of surrounding languages on Abun has been significant. It is particularly
easy to see the influence of Biak and Indonesian, as will be demonstrated below, but less so
the influence of the three neighbouring languages of Moi, Mpur and Mai Brat (Mare). This is
no doubt because the contact with Biak and Indonesian has been closer and more continuous.
   There are two tribal groups which have migrated to the region where Abun is spoken, the
As and the Biak people. The As language group, who migrated from Gag island before the
turn of the century, came to live in the subdistrict of Mega where the Abun Ji dialect is
spoken. The Biak people, who fled from the island of Biak, came into the Sausapor area in
the early 1 900s and have had a significant influence on the language of the Abun people. The
Biak people brought the Christian message to the Abun people and in doing so used many of
their own words and phrases. Words such as rur 'spirit', nadi 'pray' , sam 'worship' were
introduced from the Biak language. The word for 'God' , Yefun, has come from the Biakfun
'respected person' combined with the Abun personaliser prefix ye- 'person'. Also many
words for fish and terms related to the sea and seaside have been assimilated from the Biak
language.
   The Abun-speaking people have had contact not only with the Biak people. Trade in kain
timur '(antique) eastern cloth' with neighbouring language groups has had an influence on
Abun. Kain timur is one of the Abun-speaking people's main tokens of wealth and is used
for paying bride price as well as fines. It originates from East Timor.
   Most villagers stay close to their own village and do not travel far. Even so, the
Indonesian language has found its way to some extent even to the remotest Abun village.
Many Indonesian words also accompanied the introduction of Christianity and government
systems, and have become part of Abun vocabulary. Indonesian words such as selamat
'save' , ampuni 'forgive', perintah 'command, rule', desa 'village' and berkat 'bless' have
been introduced, although Abun speakers seldom understand the meaning of some of these
Indonesian terms.
   Several Indonesian and Biak verbs have been included in common use in Abun even
though in many cases there is an Abun lexical item for the same idea. A bi- prefix, probably
borrowed from the Biak language, is attached to verbs that are introduced from other
languages. All borrowed verbs are verbalised with what could be named, the foreign verb
verbaliser (FVV) prefix. Example 1 . 1 shows the borrowing of the Indonesian word mengerti
'understand'; example 1 .2 uses the Biak word win 'sail' .
   1. 1      I sak   bi-mengerti        suk        gata   nan   ki    ne.
             Isak FYV-understand thing which              2sG   say   DEf
             Isak understands what you are saying.
   1.2       Men bi-win         mu     ma     ef
             1 PL FYV-sail        go    LOC   island
             Let' s sail to the island.
   Abun-speaking people have borrowed words to handle new concepts such as sailing. In
example 1.2 the word is borrowed from Biak. The Abun people traditionally lived on and
around the Tambrau ranges and so did not have cause to sail anywhere. Other verbs that have
been introduced from Indonesian are tutup 'close', buka 'open' for closing and opening
6                                                                                    CHAPTER 1doors. Doors are also a new thing for the Abun. In the past they just had a nu-syo 'house
opening; doorway' (lit. house-mouth) with no door as such.
   Often the words borrowed by the Abun speaker do not retain the original pronunciation.
Abun does not have a separate velar nasal phoneme. The velar nasal occurs only medially
preceding a voiced velar plosive. So when words are borrowed such as bunga 'flower', the
ng (which represents a velar nasal) is pronounced as a prenasalised plosive by Abun
speakers. When a velar nasal is word-final in borrowed words such as kosong 'nil, empty,
zero', it is pronounced as an alveolar nasal, (koson).
   Words borrowed from other languages are also changed in pronunciation, not just
according to Abun phonology, but also because the first ones who heard the words that were
borrowed did not recall and repeat the words accurately. For example, the Biak word Jarkor
'study' was somehow changed to Jaskor by the speakers of Abun Ji dialect whereas Abun
Ye dialect speakers do not make any change.
   Indonesian conjunctions have also found their way into the Abun language. The main
conjunctions adopted from Indonesian are kalau 'if, when' , sebelum 'before', baru 'then (in
colloquial use)',jadi 'so, therefore' . Indonesian conjunctions are frequently used in addition
to Abun conjunctions because the placement of Abun conjunctions in the sentence often
differs from the Indonesian placement. In Indonesian the word sebelum 'before' is sentence­
initial, whereas in Abun the expression nde t6 'before' occurs at the end of the first clause as
in example 1 .3 below.
    1 .3        Men yo       mu    nde to,         men git su-git.
                1 PL NEG   go      NEG      INCAM 1 PL   eat NOM-eat
                Before we go let's eat.
   The Abun speaker who borrows the Indonesian sebelum 'before' , also keeps his own
language' s expression for the same idea. So the use of the more redundant form as in
example 1.4 is common.
    1.4         Sebelum men        yo       mu    nde    to,   men git su-git.
                before    1PL       NEG     go    NEG    INCAM 1 PL eat NOM-eat
                Before we go let' s eat.
    This is not just limited to conjunctions but also to other items such as the Indonesian
 prohibitionjangan 'do not' . In Abun, negation requires that yo and nde bracket the predicate
as in example 1 .3. In the prohibitive form the yo is omitted. Example 1.5a is the traditional
 way of saying 'Don't cry!' , but Abun speakers who have been influenced by Indonesian add
jangan, as in 1 .5b. However, example 1.5c is unacceptable.
    1 .5 a.     Nan w o nde.
                2sG cry NEG
                Don' t cry!
           b.   Jangall nan       wo       nde.
                do.not  2sG       cry      NEG
                Don't cry!
           c.   *Jangan nan woo
                do.not     2sG cry
                Don't cry!
INTRODUCTION                                                                                   7    Abun speakers have borrowed some Indonesian words to make meanings more specific.
The Abun word jam has the meaning of both 'to know' and 'to understand' , as in examples
1 .6 and 1 .7. They have equated jam with the Indonesian word tahu 'to know', but have
borrowed the Indonesian mengerti 'to understand' in many cases to differentiate the two
concepts, as in example 1 .7b.
   l .6        Ii jam      an gum.
               ISG know 3sG name
               I know his name.

               ISG FVV-understand 2sG         POSS    NOM-speak
               I understand what you are saying.
   Some borrowed words undergo a shift in meaning from the original meaning in the
source language. For example, even though the Abun have a way to express intensification,
they have borrowed an Indonesian word, jadi 'to happen, become' and mixed this with nde
'not' to make jadi nde ' INTENSIFIER' . They actually have many ways of expressing
intensification (see §5 .5), but they have borrowed this, even though the actual use of the
Indonesian is not standard. The meaning of jadi nde according to its components is 'did not
happen' . B ut the meaning given to it is 'happened very much ' , as in example l . 8.
   1.8         A n w o jadi          nde.
               3sG cry happen        NEG
               He cried very much.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

3.4. 1 NOUN ADJUNCTS
   There are several subclasses of noun adj uncts including the possessive linker hi (for more
detailed use of this linker see §5.3); ten prepositions; many quantifiers (including general
quantifiers, cardinal and ordinal numerals); classifiers and determiners (which have three
sub-subclasses and many compounds forms).

   Quantifiers may be either general or a specific numeral. The general quantifiers are mwa
'many ' , bak 'several' and deyo 'some' . They follow adjectives, when present, in the noun
phrase.
   The Abun numeral system is a decimal system. This is common in the West Papuan
Phylum, to which Abun belongs, but the languages belonging to the neighbouring Trans­
Papuan Phylum, some of which are in the south of the Bird' s Head Peninsula of Irian Jaya,
have a binary and additive system. Table 3 . 8 below lists the Abun numerals. Note that sop
means 'amJ./in addition' . The same word is also used in an syim-sop-kwa 'his arm-addition­
thing: his finger' .

ketke 'first ' , or the dialectal variant, do-futmo 'first' . Every other ordinal numeral is formed
by the combining of do with the appropriate cardinal numeral; for example, do-mumek
'fifth' , do-musyu dik sop we 'twelfth' and so on.
   When the quantifier is a specific numeral, a classifier normally precedes it to indicate
something of the shape and size of the object. There are many types of classifiers that may be
used depending upon the type of noun in the phrase head. In Table 3.9, the common
classifiers are l isted with the types of nouns to which they apply.

with a specific/unspecific distinction, these are yo 'a' and ne 'the' . A second subclass is the
deictics which consist of re 'this ' , ne 'that' and tu 'that (distant) ' . Thirdly, there is a referents
subclass which consists of an anaphoric referent, ga, and an external referent to. Also, the
three deictic particles and the subordinating conjunction to (a different to to the external
referent) form compounds with the referents; as well as the focus or topicaliser particle ana;
the simile particle sa; and the general locative preposition mo, as shown in Table 3 . 1 0 below:                             TABLE 3. 10: DEfERMINER RELATFD COMPOUNDS     Deictic       re                         ne                     tu                 to

   There are two subclasses in the closed class of verb adjuncts. First there are certain verbs
that combine with verbal particles. These particles, such as ma 'come' , mu 'go' and kem
'stay' do double duty as verbs, but when used as verbal particles are discontinuous with the
verb and follow the object; see §5. 1 for more details. Some of the verbal particles, like w e
'away ' , are not used as any other part of speech. Some verbs with verbal particles are listed
in Table 3. 1 1 below:

A second subclass consists of four predicate marker particles which always directly
precede the verb when present. The meanings of the predicate markers range across the entire
spectrum of concepts that are normal ly referred to as tense, aspect or mood.6 See § 1 0 for
more details. They are contained in Table 3 . 1 2 below:                                    TABlE 3. 12: PREDlCATEMARKERS          Particle                    Meaning                            Used in

10    These conjunctions are described in detail in Chapter I I .
II    See Chapter 5 where the possessive marker bi is analysed as a possessive linker.
12    This is not to rule out the possibility that the relative conjunction gata may not be a true linker.
      However its overall behavioural charateristics indicate that it is a conjunction and not just a
      particle found only in relative clauses.
152                                                                                             CHAPTER 99.5 RELATIVECLAUSE FDRMAnON STRAlEGY
   In any relative construction, the noun phrase that is denoted 'head' holds a gramm atical
relation in both clauses of that construction, namely in the main clause and in the relative
clause. Cross-linguistically, it appears that there is more significant variation in encoding the
grammatical relation of the head in the embedded clause, than is found in the main clause
(Comrie 1 989: 147, 1 53). Comrie distinguishes four major strategies for encoding the head
within the relative clause. These he terms non-reduction, pronoun retention, relative pronoun
and gap (Comrie 1989: 147). Non-reduction means ""that the head noun appears in full,
unreduced form, in the embedded sentence, in the normal position and/or with the normal
case marking"". With pronoun retention, the head noun is represented in the embedded clause
as a pronoun. When a relative pronoun is used, it is in clause-initial position and it is marked
for case. With any of these three strategies the role of the head noun within the relative clause
is overtly indicated ( 1 989 : 1 5 1 ). The fourth strategy, however, does not provide any overt
indication at all of the role of the head within the relative clause. The head is actually omitted
from the relative clause. For this reason it is called a gap strategy. A study of Abun relative
clause structure shows that Abun uses the fourth strategy in Comrie' s list, the gap strategy.
   Abun does not make any overt reference to the head noun within the restricting clause.
The embedded clause does not retain a pronoun referring to the head noun, nor is there a
relative clause pronoun which specifically refers to the head noun, nor is there a full noun
phrase inside the embedded clause. The head is omitted in the restricting clause, thereby
creating a gap. But since the restricting clause does not contain any reference to the head
noun, how can one know what grammatical relation the relativised argument holds?
  As explained in Chapter 4, Abun does not actually mark the case of nouns. The
gramm atical relations of Subject, Object and so on are normally marked by word order.
Therefore, it is the word order of the relative clause and the location of the gap created by the
omission of the head that provide the clues for encoding the gramm atical relation of the head.
For example:
     9.22      M e mu gu y e        gato man siri     su    men bi     nggon.
               I PL go kill person RFL do wrong with I PL POSS woman
               We (will) go (and) kill the person who has slept with our woman (woman
               from our clan).
   In example 9.22 above the restricting clause following gato contains no subject. There is a
gap between the relative conjunction gato and the verb phrase man siri 'do wrong' ,
indicating that the embedded clause contains no overt subject. Therefore the grammatical
relation of the head ye 'person' within the restricting clause is subject. Compare this example
with the relation of the relativised argument in example 9.23:
     9.23      Ii nut-bot            ye      galo ji         i-wa                ne.
               I SG thought-about person RFL            I SG happY-TRs           DEY
               I thought about the person that I liked.
   Here there is a gap after the verb iwa 'like', even though the transitive suffix -wa indicates
that this verb is a transitive verb. Therefore in this case the head ye 'person' is interpreted as
having the grammatical relation of object in the relative clause. 1 3
13    It is to be noted here that this clause also contains a determiner which will be discussed i n §9.S. 1
      below. The determiner i s more common when the head has the grammatical relation o f object.
RELATNE CLAUSES                                                                                1539.5. 1 THE ROLE OF mE DETERMINER
   It was said in §9. 1 above that some restncl1ve relative clauses are closed with a
determiner. The demonstrative pronouns re 'this' and ne 'that' have several functions in
Abun and one of these is to behave as a determiner. Unlike English determiner usage it is not
obligatory to use the determiner after a noun in Abun.","[163, 164, 165]"

8.3 NEGATION IN SUBORDINATE ClAUSES   According to Payne ( 1 985b:240), in many languages the devices which are used for
negating subordinate clauses are different from those used in main clauses. He cites several
examples, including Yoruba, where the main clause negative particle is ko, while the particle
used to negate subordinate clauses is rna. In Abun most subordinate clauses are negated in
the same way as main clauses, the only exception being negative purpose subordinate
clauses, as in English 'lest' (or 'in order that.. .not' ).
   For example, in 8.26a the whole sentence is negated. By way of contrast, 8 . 26b illustrates
how the embedded clause itself may be negated, resulting in a different meaning. The same
pair of negative particles is used.
   8 .26 a.     Ii yo      me     Isak     ben suk       rn o    nggwe nde.
                l SG NEG    see    Isak   do     things LOC      gardenNEG
                I did not see Isak working at the garden.
         b. Ii       me    Isak yo         ben suk       rn o    nggwe    nde.
                l SG see   Isak   NEG     do    things   LOC     garden   NEG
                I saw Isak not working at the garden.
    Again, when the subordinate clause is indirect speech introduced by the subordinating
conjunction do, the negation of that clause uses the same pair of linked particles. In example
8 .27a the whole sentence is negated, whereas 8 .27b shows the negation of the subordinate
clause.
   8.27 a.      Moses yo      k i gada     do   an   kra        su   Barbarina   0           nde.
                Moses NEG say earlier that 3sG marry with Barbarina            again         NEG
                Earlier Moses did not say again that he would marry Barbarina.
         b. Moses k i    gado do        an yo     kra     su   Barbarina             0        nde.
            Moses say earlier that 3sG NEG marry with B arbarina                     again    NEG
            Earlier Moses said that he would not marry Barbarina again .
140                                                                                         CHAPTER 8   Abun does have a fonn corresponding to the English 'lest', which consists of the
preposition kadit 'from' linking with the primary negative particle nde to bracket the
subordinate clause as illustrated in example 8.28.","[151, 152]"
"   It could be said that if only a single noun phrase can constitute the direct object, as in the
above examples, this would confirm the analysis that only a part of the embedded clause
functions as the direct object. However these sentences show that for Abun sentence
structure only a single constituent division follows the predicate. This single division consists
of the direct object. There is a single division only, rather than two constituent divisions
following the predicate as is posited by the alternative analysis. If it is assumed that there are
two constituents which follow the predicate in these cases--one a direct object and the other a
truncated clause-we are left with determining the constituent status of these truncated
clauses. In some languages like English, it is possible to have reduced subordinate clauses
which have no overt subject as in the following: ' Having eaten the hamburger, he got on with
the rest of his work' . However Abun does not appear to have subjectless subordinate
clauses. If example 1 0.66 is considered again,
              Men yo        nyu-wa   men mu ki.          suk-du     re        nde.
              I pL NEG   fear-TRs I pL go         say NOM-say       this      NEG
              We are not afraid to go and tell this story.what is the status of mu ki sukdu re? Subjectless constituents like this do not exist elsewhere
in the language. There are occasions when a subject may be omitted. Sometimes in narratives
where the subject is the same or a number of events is given in quick succession, the subject
may be omitted.

                just struggling, struggling in one place.
   In both these examples there are several clauses where the subject was omitted. In both
cases the omitted subject was not in the immediate context of the clauses concerned. The
omitted subject was given several clauses earlier. In example 1 0.69 the omitted subject
'people' was given only two clauses preceding. However, in example 1 0.70 the omitted
subject is 'eel' and is given four clauses prior to the first which takes 'eel' as its subject. It
can be seen that in Abun omitted subjects occur only in certain types of narrative, particularly
where these subjects have several actions attributed to them. In these instances the subjects
are omitted from either simple clauses or coordinate clauses. These clauses are not
subjectless embedded clauses.2 7
   On this basis it is concluded that a subjectless subordinate clause is not a valid clause type
in Abun. A sentence having the constituent division SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT is quite common
in Abun. However, a sentence which has the constituent division
                                 SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT + (VERB + OBJECT)
is not. 28 In the above the embedded clause is subjectless.
   There are languages such as English which allow fronting of subordinate clauses.
Frequently, when a subordinate clause is fronted it consists of verb and object only.
However, in Abun it is not possible to front any subordinate or embedded clause. Since
fronting is not possible this cannot be used as a test of subordination.","[195, 196]"
"     The use of linked pairs of negative particles is uncommon. However French is a well­
documented example of the use of a linked pair of negative particles, for example, j e
n e. . . suis pas. The first particle n e is the primary particle and then pas i s added. Payne
( 1 985b:224) claims that in the case where such linked pairs of negative particles do occur, the
second particle occurs because there is a strong tendency for a single negative particle to be
reinforced and emphasised by the addition of a second particle. Payne analyses pas as the
added particle that reinforces the negation in French.
   By way of contrast, Abun places the primary particle after the predicate, not before as in
French. Also the operation of the secondary particle in Abun is not so much to reinforce the
negation of a sentence as Payne claims of French, but rather to mark the predicate and thus
delineate the scope of negation.",[147]
"9.6 'ADVERBIAL' RELATIVE CLAUSES
   In Abun the relative clause may be used with a head which refers to the adverbial concepts
of time, location and manner. In Abun a subordinate adverbial clause can be formed by
means of the relative conjunction gato. Abun does not possess adverb forms such as the
English 'when ' , 'where' or 'how' , which may themselves act as conj unctions at the head of
a subordinate adverbial clause. Instead a time word, another conjunction or a locative
preposition together with galo serve as the conj unctions in these cases.

   In example 9.40 below sugato 'with that' has come to mean 'the time that' or 'when ' .
This i s an adaptation o f tepsu gato where tepsu means 'like' or 'just as' . Tepsu gato is used
as a general, non-specific time expression in the same way as the English 'when ' .
   9.40      Sugato      Fredik s i  Pontius m u watbot bus an-we
             with.that   Fredik with Pontius go examine rope 3PL-two
             ku nok        dik yo       di        mo bus.
             find wild.pig one DELI struggle in rope
             At the time that (when) Fredik and Pontius went to examine (their) rope (pig
             trap) they found a wild pig struggling in the rope.
   Another expression used to denote 'when' is tom gato 'the time that' .
   9.41      Ji nuk-bot              tom gato yen          gu yu      mo-re.
             lSG tell.story-about time REL people kill REFL at-here
             I will tell about the time that there was fighting here.
   In example 9.42 below, the general locative noun nat 'place' is modified or relativised in
exactly the same way as the non-locative noun nu 'house' in example 9.43. In fact the
English translation of 9 .43 needs to omit any relative marker and replace it with 'where' to
make good sense, but no such alternative construction is available in Abun.
   9.42      Men gwat mu-kom            mo nat       gato men gu           nok     mo.
             I PL bring go-reach to           place REL       I PL   kill wild.pig exist
             We brought (it) up to the place that we had killed the wild pig.
   9.43      Men mu kagit nu         gato men kra       su   mone.
             I PL go    from house REL I PL       marry with there
             We went from the house where we were married.
    In examples 9.40 to 9.43 above the construction used to form these subordinate adverbial
clauses is identical to that of the relative clause. A head (usually a noun) is followed by the
relative conjunction gato, which is then followed by the subordinate restricting clause.
However, there are other instances of adverbial clauses where there is no identifiable head to
make the structure comparable to a relative clause. In these cases two clauses are joined by
gato combined with some other form. In examples 9.44 and 9.45 below the conjunction sa
'like/as' precedes gato to create an adverbial clause of manner.
   9.44      An da      ben mo sarewo an yo                   ben kete
             3SG actual do exist however 3sG NEG              do too.much
             bado yo        teker       sa    gato nyim ne nde reo
             maybe NEG too.much like REL earlier ORr NEG PERF
             Although she does (these things) she does not do (them) very much, I mean,
             not like (she did them ) before.
   9.45      Nggon w e but      gre nak ge w e sa ga y e         w e but     o.
             woman two catch frog nak CL two like REL person two catch again
             The two women caught two nak frogs in the same way that the two men (had)
             caught (two nak frogs earlier).
    In examples 9.46 and 9.47 the locative mo 'at' precedes gato to create an adverbial clause
of reason. Here the events expressed in the second clause are the reason for the events of the
first.

39    It could be said that on this basis Abun does possess a subordinate/coordinate distinction of clause
      types. We have preferred not to incorporate this distinction within our analysis because as pointed
      out at the beginning of Chapter 1 1 there is little syntactic marking to distinguish the two types.
      Rather we have preferred to distinguish the other syntactic feature that these conjunctions possess,
      namely the ability to compound and create new forms.

   The third conjunction that is included in the group of compounding conjunctions is the
sequential conjunction te 'then ' . Abun has no single conjunction which in meaning i s
precisely equivalent to a coordinate conjunction such a s the English 'and ' . However, t e and
its dialect variant ge in compound form produce a number of varying sequential
conjunctions. It has been observed (Longacre 1985 :267) that the notions of temporal
simultaneity and sequence ""are elaborated with considerable range and variety in Papua New
Guinea"". The number of sequential variants found in Abun is typical of a Papuan language
and shows something of the influence of these languages on Abun syntax. It may be
uncommon to group sequential conjunctions together with those conjunctions meaning
'because' and 'but'. However, there are no syntactic distinctions found in Abun complex
sentences which correlate with the semantic differences of these conjunctions and which
would justify a further subdivision. Another type of conjunction, (that which means
'alternation' , such as the English 'or' ) is also normal ly considered together with a
conjunction of contrast such as wo 'but' . Abun has no single morpheme which i s used to
indicate alternation. 40 Therefore for Abun, on the basis of common syntactic behaviour,
sequential conjunctions are included within the second group of prepositional
conjunctions-the 'compounding' conjunctions. Examples of sentences containing te and its
variant ge are given below:
     1 2.28   Men kem sane                  wade jam            dik        bayok,     te     men

              jam      kapar-ok uk.
              hear ship-fly make.noise
              We stayed there for about an hour, then we heard the noise of the plane.
     1 2.29   An maskwa ge        an    gu     an    bi   nggon kam-dik kam-dik.
              3sG angry     then 3sG beat 3sG POSS woman day-one day-one
              He was angry then he beat his wife every day.
   Given that these examples differ significantly from those normally described as
'subordinate' or 'coordinate', is a third option available? For example, is it possible to40    This is a feature marked on each clause which may represent a choice to the hearer. In
      interrogatives bado is used. Otherwise the temporal subordinate conjunction yo is used, or the
      particle ka, a borrowed term from the unrelated Biak language.
PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCllONS                                                           21 1consider these sentences as 'cosubordinate' in the same way that Foley and Van Valin apply
 this term to various clause types that are found in the clause-chaining languages of Papua
New Guinea and elsewhere? They describe their usage of the term 'cosubordinate' in the
following way (Foley & Van Valin 1984:257): ""a dependency relation exists between the
j uncts in that they must have the same illocutionary force and share the same absolute tense"".
This is not the case for Abun where, as illustrated in example 1 2.24 above, the imperative
mood is marked only on the first clause and the second clause i s marked by an aspect
marker.4 1 In fact the Abun sentences described here fit more closely Foley and Van Valin' s
definition o f coordination, although they (Foley & Van Valin 1 984:243) admit that they do
not use this term in the 'traditional ' sense:
      Coordinate nexus applies to any construction in which the j uncts are not in a part­
      whole relationship i.e. one junct is not embedded in the other and both juncts
      may be independently specified for the operators at the given level of j uncture.","[221, 222, 223]"
"   Perhaps in these cases the clause that fol lows rna gata does not represent an adverbial
clause of reason because no conjunction which indicates reason, such as we 'because' , has
been used. Rather, an additional clause has been joined to the sentence by means of the
locative preposition rna in exactly the same way that a locative phrase would be joined to the
clause. In Abun, with predicates such as sa 'laugh' and maskwa 'be angry ' , additional
arguments may be required in the clause to indicate not the object of these predicates, but
rather the reason behind the action. If this reason is expressed as a full clause, the clause is
embedded in the main clause by the dual means of the locative preposition rna and the
relative conjunction gata. 1 6
   I n these types of example we find that gata i s used i n clauses that could not be described
as restrictive relative clauses. Wherever sa gata and rna gata are used they appear to join
clauses rather than modify a head. In these cases the clauses that follow gata are full clauses.
There is no gap in these clauses because they are not relative clauses. It was discussed earlier
that gata was a relative conjunction rather than a relative marker (§9.3.3). It seems then that
in its function as a conjunction gata may join subordinate clauses to larger structures, even
though these are not relative clauses and are adverbial in meaning.
9.7 lNDEFlNITE RELATNE CLAUSES
   In the previous section clauses that departed from the standard relative clause type were
discussed. In this section another type of relative clause, the 'indefinite' relative clause, will
be shown to differ from the 'standard' restrictive relative clause. These types of clause, due to
the non-referential nature of the head, we have termed 'indefinite relative clauses' to
distinguish them from relative clauses of the regular variety. Structurally they differ from
regular relative clauses in that only the noun-modifying particle ta is used, rather than the
16    The concept of prepositions which behave as conjunctions will be developed further in Chapter 12.
1 60                                                                                              CHAPTER 9relative conjunction gato, and they do not require the use of the determiner, as in example
9.49. 1 7
     9.49       Suk     to     a     ku    mone yo               a       gu        we.

                1 . Anything that you find there, kill it (dispose of it).
                2. Whatever you find there, get rid of it.
    Huddleston terms the English equivalent of this type of construction a 'fused relative'
construction to distinguish it from other types of relative clause. In English, a non-specific
referent is marked by some type of wh phrase, by means of whoever, what or where
(Huddleston 1 984:403). Givon ( 1 990:646) also finds these types of relative problematic
since they do not line up with his semantic definition of a restrictive relative clause, namely
""A relative clause codes a proposition one of whose participants is coreferential with the
head noun that is modified by that clause"". If the head noun is non-referential there cannot be
strict referential identity, since many of these relative constructions concern hypothetical or
unknown situations.
   In Abun the fact that these are a different type of relative construction is grammatically
marked. Abun is a language in which it is important to mark the distinction between that
which is real and known and that which is hypothetical and unknown. Normally within the
noun phrase, if any information in a sentence is not given (that is already known), the
determiner yo 'indefinite, alan' is used in conj unction with the noun concerned. Therefore
Abun grammar marks the fact that nouns may refer to either actual or hypothetical entities.
When a noun represents the head of a relative clause, it is important in Abun to mark this
noun so that it can be interpreted as referring to some specific known referent or to some
hypothetical entity.
   It was explained earlier that the relative conjunction was composed of two morphemes,
the particles ga and to. In §9.3 . 1 , the role of the particle ga was explained as serving to
identify or mark the head of the relative clause as a specific referential identity. In the types of
construction, described as 'indefinite relative clauses' , the noun of the head has no real world
semantic referent at the time of utterance. There may be a range of possible referents but none
that is specific or known. Therefore this noun cannot be modified by gao The simple solution
in Abun is that these nouns are modified only by the general subordinating particle to. Since
ga is absent it is obvious that these nouns have no specific referent and are therefore
interpreted as non-referential. In English the same constructions need the addition of 'any' or
'ever' to make this clear, as examples 9.50 and 9.5 1 indicate.","[171, 172]"
"   A further clarification of negation in subordinate clauses is necessary in the case where a
relative clause in the object position is negated as well as the whole sentence. In such a case
only one nde is required, as in example 8 .30a. This particle fonns the bracket for both the
subordinate clause and the sentence. There are two occurrences of yo in 8.30a, whereas in
8.30b only the relative clause is negated, while in 8.30c the whole sentence is negated.
   8.30 a.      An    yo         git    roti    gato     yo       it     nde.
                3SG NEG       eat bread      REI..    NEG        rise    NEG
                He did not eat bread that was not risen.
           b. A n   git roti      gato yo               it      nde.
              3sG eat     bread REI..     NEG           rise    NEG
              He ate bread that was not risen.
           c.   An    yo      git       roti    gato      it     nde.
                3SG NEG       eat bread      REI..   rise         NEG
                He did not eat bread that was risen.
   A similar structure (with two occurrences of yo and one of nde) is used to indicate that a
particular action has never been done, as in example 8 . 3 1 . Both occurrences of yo are
preferred here because Musa does not eat fish and he has not ever done this. The second
occurrence of yo can be omitted, but Abun speakers tend to include it to reinforce the point
they are making - 'Musa doesn ' t eat fish, he never does' .
   8.3 1        Musa yo          git    boge   yo      rno      nde.
                Musa NEG eat       fish    NEG         exist    NEG
                Musa has never eaten fish.
   For further discussion of negation in subordinate clauses see § 10.2.5 and § 1 0.3 . 1 .2.
NEGATION                                                                                       1418.4 NEGATION IN WORDS   Abun is a language with very little affixation. As may be expected there are no affixes
used to negate words, as in the case of English, with words such as 'un-happy' and 'dislike ' .
However, there are a number o f verbs that are inherently negative in meaning such as:                   bari          do not want
                   bagri         do not want to eat
                   barnbrai      do not want to do something
                   bandof        do not feel comfortable with heights
                   bagwo         do not like being tickled
  Ba- could be analysed as a negative prefix, but the roots -ri, -gri, -brai, -ndof and
-gwo do not occur as free morphemes.
    These verbs remove the need for the use of the negative particles. Example 8.32a is a
negative indicative sentence. The use of an inherently negative verb (bariwa 'do not want to' ,
a s in example 8.32b), without the negative particles has the same meaning as the
corresponding positive verb used with the negative particles. The use of the inherently
negative verb with the negative particles makes the meaning a positive one, as in 8.32c.
   8.32 a.    Ji    yo       i-wa        ji      rn u    rno    nggwe nde.

5.7 . 1 CONJUNCTION
     There are five different strategies used to conjoin phrases and sentences listed by Payne
( 1 985a:25-37), consisting of the use of simple juxtaposition (he calls the 'zero' strategy),
'and' , 'with' , 'pronoun' and 'dual ' strategies. Abun employs the first three types of strategies
to conjoin phrases and sentences.
    In simple juxtaposition, there are no markers of conjunction. Juxtaposition is a normal
alternative existing alongside other strategies. This strategy is permitted at all levels from
sentence to noun phrase, as well as in verb phrases (verb phrases, incidentally, only allow
this type of strategy to give what appear to be serial verb formations). Examples are:(i) Sentence:
     5 . 163    Ye      kwam            ye        gu            an.
                people hit.with.instr people hit.with.hand 3SG
                They were hitting with a stick and (they were) punching him.(ii) Prepositional Phrase:
     5 . 1 64   Ye     ma    kagit Pet kagit Bamogwem               kagit Bikar.
                people come from Pef from Bamogwem                  from B ikar
                They came from Pef, Bamogwem and Bikar.(iii) Noun Phrase:
     5 . 1 65   An    hi    nggon nggon y i        dom an      rot nde.
                3sG poss woman woman other also 3SG touch NEG
                His wife and other women also he must not touch.
PHRASE STRUCfURE                                                                             95(iv) Verb Phrase:
   5 . 1 66   An    kas rn u sern      rno nden.
              3so run go       sleep LOC bush
              He ran and went and slept in the bush.
   5 . 1 67   Ye-suk-m ise    rna    nai     gwat an      mu keto
              PERs-NoM-evil   come capture take     3so go west
              The police came and caught him and took him westward.
    Apposition, where the two heads involved stand in a mutually attributive relationship (that
is, each head is at the same time an attribute of the other head), is a special case of this
unmarked type of coordination. Alternatively, when the heads are single nouns, as in
examples 5. 1 68 and 5 . 169, they may be analysed as a single noun phrase, as discussed in
§5.2. 1 above. Thus an apposition noun phrase in Abun has the structure of NP + NP. Two or
more noun phrases are j uxtaposed. For example:
   5 . 1 68   Men ye-nden      git nggruk     nde.
              I PL PERS-bush eat turtle       NEG
              We, 'Bush' people must not eat turtle.
   5. 1 69    Ye      ne ye-su-go-te              ye- Waropen.
              person DEf PERs-head-hair-black PERs-Waropen
              That person is a Papuan, a Waropen.
   5 . 1 70   Ji   bi     nji      ye-guru         rno    nden     kwop reo
              I so poss brother PERs-teacher LOC          bush     die  PERF
              My brother, the inland teacher, has died.
   With recursive apposition, the head of the noun phrase is repeated, as in example 5 . 1 7 1 .
B y way of contrast, i n the case where a subsequent noun phrase modifies the first using the
noun modifying particle to, the head of the phrase is not repeated, as in 5 . 1 72.
   5.171      An    it     san     be,       san     rno    sern     ne    san
              3so   put.on clothes new       clothes LOC    sea      DEf   clothes
              to-d     san     pis.
              EXT-this clothes wrap. around
              She put on new clothes, modem clothes, these clothes, wrap-around clothes.
   5. 1 72    Wo suk-fo         to     ndarn syor          ne yo,         nu-we      git nde.
              but thing-taboo NMP bird cassowary that then.1RR 2PL-two               eat NEG
              But a forbidden thing, that is that cassowary, you two can not eat.
   In the 'and' strategy, the coordinating particle e is used as a conjunction in sentences and
phrases. In the case of noun phrases the form is:                                       [NP e ] n NP e
   There is no distinction in meaning between the use of this particle and simple
juxtaposition. Therefore examples are found in sentences, prepositional phrases and noun
phrases similar to those examples given above. In all cases e may be added between the noun
phrases, but may not be added for verb phrases. This particle is widely used and conjoins
phrases in subject or object positions in Abun sentences, as in examples 5 . 1 73 and 5 . 1 74
96                                                                                            CHAPTER 5
respectively. Topicalised objects may also include complex phrases conjoined by e , as in
example 5 . 1 75 .
     5 . 1 73    Abi    e   Arun e         Joni e           nm     gro     mut      et.

     5 . 1 74    Nin w e    git suge      sato nok       e         be              e      ron
                 2PL two    eat animal    like wild. pig and       kangaroo        and    tree.kangaroo
                 e    ne.
                 and DEI'
                 Eat animals such as wild pigs, kangaroos, tree kangaroos and the like.
     5. 175      Mbos e     ndabu        e     ndam ga       sye    ne      e       an
                 pigeon and dove         and   bird REI..    big    DEI'    and     3PL
                Iowa        sino.
                forbidden all
                Pigeons, doves and birds that are big, they are all forbidden (for women to eat).
  The 'with ' strategy is widely used to conjoin noun phrases. It is rarel y used in sentences
and is not permitted in prepositional phrase constructions. Payne points out that this is a very
common strategy and that usually the coordinating particle is identical to the adposition
marking the associative sense of 'with' ( 1 985a:29). This is not quite true for Abun, where the
coordinating particle is si 'with ' , while the associative preposition is su 'with ' ; the two forms
nevertheless appearing cognate.
     The 'with' strategy is evident in Abun coordinate noun phrases in either of two ways:     1.     [NP si] n NP
     5 . 1 76    Ji si    Dina si   Yulius si   Isak,              men      ma   nyim          mo
                 Iso with Dina with Yulius with Isak               1 PL     come ahead         LOC
                 nu        reo
                 house PERF
                 1 . I with Dina and with Yulius and with Isak, we had come ahead to the house.
                 2. Dina and Yulius and Isak and I, we (all) had come ahead (of the others) to
                    the house.","[106, 107, 108]"
"
6.2.4 PROHIBITIVE
    The prohibitive form prohibits action; for example, the addressee in the example above is
prohibited from going to see Sadrak' s mother. Compare the commands for action in 6.77a
-C , to the prohibition, using nde, in 6.77d. This example is a negative imperative applying to
the second person.
1 20                                                                                   CHAPTER 6
   The prohibitive form also encompasses first and third persons, hence the use of the label
'prohibitive' rather than 'negative imperative' . The term prohibitive includes all persons and
numbers in the same way as do requests and commands discussed above. Examples 6.78
and 6.79 show that the meaning can be regulatory or enforcing a prohibition, making clear
this form is not limited to negative imperatives. In these examples the third and first persons
are prohibited respectively. For further discussion see § 8. 1 . 1 .
   6.78      Nggon     git     ndam-syor          nde.
             Women eat bird-syor      NEG
             Women must not eat cassowary.
   6.79      Men git         sek           nde.
             1 PL eat   possum NEG
             We must not eat possum.
  The particle nde does not indicate any difference in urgency or force as the posItIve
imperatives do. Instead nde simply conveys prohibition. It is unacceptable to include the
hortative particles with nde in the following example:
   6.80      *Nan git j i          hi       sugit tom          nde!!
             2sG eat IsG           poss     food HORT(S)       NEG

1 1 .2.2 THE IRREALIS CONJUNCTION yo
    In the previous section the conjunction sa was described as a temporal subordinating
conjunction which could be rendered as 'when' in Engli sh. Sa was described as a 'realis'
conjunction because its usage indicates a past time setting for the clauses that it links. In the
same way the conjunction yo is also a temporal conjunction. It also may be rendered in
English as ' when ' . However, yo differs from sa in that it is an irrealis conjunction. Any
sentence marked by yo has an implied futurity. The meaning of yo contrasts with that of sa
in that the events of clauses joined by yo have the meaning of future time, are possible events
in the future or are completely hypothetical events, that is 'when.IRREALIS' . In Abun yo is
used in basically four ways:
                                                            ,
    1 . To express intent or plans 'when(future). . .(then)
    2. To describe procedures in hypothetical situations 'when(hypothetical) ... (then)'
                                                                                        ,
    3. To describe conditions in general hypothetical situations 'if/whenever. ..(then)
                                                                                         ,
    4. To describe a compulsory consequence following a condition ' if.. .then(must)
   The following examples i llustrate the way yo is used in Abun.",[210]
"
6.2.3 HORTATIVE
   Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985: 1 60) claim that ""most languages have an imperative restricted
to second person logical subjects"". To show an exception to this they refer to Onondaga,
which has a general imperative type that occurs in all persons and numbers and covers a wide
range of more specific acts. In labelling such a sentence type, they argue ( 1 985:77) that ""The
HORTATIVE is in some languages simply a first or third person form of the imperative . . . We
might say that. . . (as in Onondaga), there is only a hortative form ... "". Abun, likewise, does not
restrict the subject to second person, but also includes other persons; thus we have labelled
1 18                                                                                            CHAPTER 6

             I carried (the wood) away, I left it somewhere and the garden was cleared.
   Also frequently used to join sequential clauses is or-e 'after-and' or more simply
translated as 'and' . The addition of or 'finish/after' indicates that the action expressed by the
previous clause is finished and so this adds to the sequential nature of the sentence.
   1 2.38    Nggon w e si         Abaidim kwas ore        go      ore    ti k     on                ne.
             women two with Abaidim burn and cut.up and pull intestines DET
             The two women and Abaidim burned off (the hairs of the skin) and they cut
             (the meat) up and they pulled out the intestines.
   Thus the morphemes        e    and or are joined with te/ge to create other sequential
conjunctions.(i) ete ' and then'
   By far the most commonly used sequential conjunction in any narrative or dialogue is ete
'and then ' . It is more frequently used than both of its constituents, e and teo   1 2.39    A n taru          wa        men ete          men mao

             2. If you keep doing things like this then what will the outcome be for the
                 family?(ii) orete/orge 'after that then'
    Yet another sequential conjunction is created by the addition of the adverb or ' after/finish'
to the conjunction ete 'and then' . Orete and its dialect variant orge differ little in meaning to
ete. The addition of or emphasises that the action expressed by the first clause of the
sentence is finished before proceeding to the action of the second clause. The notion of
immediate chronological sequence is made more evident by usage of orete rather than ete.
Like ete, orete is frequently used.

             I came and I stored the things and then I went off again.
   By the illustration of the above examples it can be seen that the Abun speaker has a wide
variety of options when wishing to link clauses that are sequential in nature. As well as not
using any conjunction at all, the speaker may choose from five different conjunctions in
order to express the notion of temporal sequence. Therefore in any sentence of a sequential
nature it is possible to find more than one sequential conjunction used.
   1 2.44    An gwa drom det             pu            or-ete      yenggras Erensi

             She beat on the drum loudly and then old Erensi was startled and Erensi got
             up.
(iii) etey% reteyo ' and next/and so'
   There are two more sequential conjunctions in Abun, but these two have the component
of meaning of result or outcome added to that of temporal sequence. The conjunctions ete
and orete, when expanded by the tensed conjunction yo, result in two new conjunctions
meaning 'and so' , where both the concepts of sequence and logical result are combined in
one form. In this case the addition of yo does not indicate an irrealis or non-past time setting
for the sentence as when yo is normally used. The addition of yo creates a new conjunction
which differs in its range of meaning and usage from other sequential conjunctions. The uses
of oreteyo compared to orete and other sequential conj unctions is shown by the examples
below. Example 1 2.45 was earlier given as example 1 2 .4 1 .
PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                              215   1 2.45     An kon      su-git,       men git mone or-ete             men mu mo Syurur.
              3SG cook NOM-food I PL eat there after-then I PL go to                       Syurur
              He cooked food, we ate there and then we went to Syurur.

              He stirred up problems and then as a result his child died.
   Example 1 2.45 describes a series of events which presumably were accomplished in
close chronological sequence. This is normally the case when the conjunctions ete and orete
are used. However, example 1 2.46 does not describe events that occur in close chronological
sequence. The time sequence between the two clauses concerned is more indefinite. Rather, it
seems that the second clause does not merely follow on chronologically after the first clause,
but follows as a result of the first one. The event expressed by the second clause arises from,
or is due to the events of the first. Other examples below i llustrate this:
   1 2.47     Men is-bot                jip       mu    n im m u      bur       ware, Isak

              We went down along the stairs, we went up and down, but to no avail, Isak
              was confused as to where to go, and then as a result at the bottom of the
              stairwell we were lost.
   1 2.48     Nan bi       mben      gato kra           nan b i        nyanggon     e          ba

              agree. meet 2SG ANA-DE[ and. next thing-INDEF stab perhaps
              Your in-law who married your sister went out to meet you and (what
              happened) next, did something spear him perhaps? [The in-law had died.]
              [ ' What happened next?' could also be read as 'What was the outcome?']
   Examples 1 2.47 and 1 2.48 above show that something more than sequence i s involved.
In both of these examples there is some cause-effect relationship involving the two events
that are linked by ete-yolor-ete-yo. The second event is regarded as being the result or
outcome of the first. Thus eteyoloreteyo has been translated as ' and so' or 'and then as a
result' to indicate its difference to other sequential conjunctions.
   Oreteyo can also be used to link a series of clauses which represent a list of steps or
actions in a common process. In these cases, there is a common semantic thread expressed
by the sequence of clauses, which concerns the completion of the process being described.
To understand this better, it can be seen in example 1 2.45 given earlier that while there is a
semantic thread between the first two clauses, 'He cooked food, we ate there . . . ' , there i s none
between these first two and the final clause, 'and then (orete) we went to Syurur' . The event
expressed by this final clause did not follow as a direct result of the events of the other two
clauses. A conjunction like orete does not create any logical expectations. A clause such as
'and then we went to sleep' could also have followed the first two. This is not the case when
oreteyo is used, as example 1 2.49 shows below:
216                                                                                             CHAPTER 12
   1 2.49     Pa             go        pa                krop            pa              bok     jamtu
              young.man      cut.up    young.man make.hole young.man insert vine
              mo oreteyo      pa               far jamtu nggwa.
              in   and. next young. man tie vine loop
              The young men cut (it) up, they put holes (in it), they put vine through the
              holes and then they tied the vine into loops.
   Oreteyo is used to link the final clause in these sequences indicating that the outcome of
the process has been reached. Oreteyo precedes the clause that expresses the end of a
semantically related chain of events. In this way the behaviour of the conjunction oreteyo i s
not unlike that o f the final verb o f a chain in clause-chaining languages. In such languages the
distinct markings that the verb takes for tense and person indicate that the end of the chain
has been reached. Likewise by the choice of the conjunction oreteyo speakers can indicate
that the end of certain sequences has been reached. Again there i s something more than
chronological sequence involved. Examples 1 2.50 and 1 2.5 1 below show oreteyo used in
this way. Here it has been translated 'and.next' to distinguish this usage from that in the
earlier examples.

3 .2 EsTABLISHING WORD CLASSES
   In this section the parts of speech appropriate for the Abun language will be defined after a
discussion of the basis upon which the distinctions are made.
    In establishing the parts-of-speech classification for the Abun language, grammatical
criteria have been employed, namely the word ' s distribution, its range of syntactic functions
and the morphological or syntactical categories for which it is specifiable. These criteria are
listed by Schachter ( 1 985 :3), who states they are not open to the objections of unclear
application that traditional definitions are.
   Once the types of word classes are established on the basis of grammatical criteria, they
are given a label that reflects their characteristics. For example, words that express actions,
processes and the like are called verbs. A label for a word class is decided upon after the
word class has been established.
MORPHOWGYAND WORD ClASSES                                                                  25   Honey ( 1 972: 277) makes the point that ""the object of the grammarian i s to establish
categories of words which are most efficient for enabling him to make the most
comprehensive and, at the same time, the simplest grammatical statements . . . "". Honey
developed systematic syntactic statements whereby he established his system of word classes
for Vietnamese (which is also an analytical language like Abun) on the basis of positional
relationships of certain selected words and/or classes of words. Some of his methods have
been applied in order to establish a set of word classes for Abun.
   The word classes in Abun have been divided into open and closed classes. Open classes
of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs have a membership that is in principle unlimi ted.
Closed classes, which in Abun are noun adjuncts, verb adjuncts, conj unctions, proforms,
particles and interjections, have a fixed and generally small number of words.","[36, 37]"
"
7. 1 . 1 PERFECT ASPECr   Re, a totally different morpheme from the determiner re 'this' , in the absence of any
contextual time reference indicates that an event has taken place. The use of re confirms the
actuality of an event, and implies its continuing present relevance. Such is the definition of
'perfect' suggested by Comrie ( 1 976:52). By comparing the examples in 7 . 1 , one can see
that the latter indicates the continuing relevance of the action 'cut' to the remainder of the
story. On the other hand, 7 . 1 a says nothing about the continuing relevance of the cut
confirmed by the next sentence of the discourse, which tells of how the storyteller went to see
Moses and of the extent of the cut.
   7 . 1 a.    Prisila sap Moses sy im        brot    toko.
               Prisila cut Moses hand vein            broken
               Prisila cut a vein in Moses' hand in half.          b.   Prisila sap Moses syim         brot toko        reo
               Prisila cut Moses hand vein broken PERF
               Prisila had cut a vein in Moses' hand in half.
    Again, in example 7 .2, Prisila had gone to the mountain and was still there when the next
part of the discourse took place; that is, the use of re indicates the continuing present
relevance of a past situation to the coming events. In a sense it provides the background or
situation in which the coming events occur.
   7.2         An    mu    mo    banbo        reo
               3sG go     LOC mountain PERF
               She had gone to the mountain.
  The use of the perfect aspect particle is also common with states such as death and
marriage, for example:
   7.3         Pa    ne    kwop reo
               child DEf die       PERF
               The child had died.
   7 .4        An    kra    Andar     bi      zm       reo
               3sG marry Andar poss mother PERF
               He had married Andar's mother.
   Comrie ( 1 976: 56) discusses four different types of perfect: perfect of result, experiential
perfect, perfect of persistent situation and perfect of recent past. He says that not all languages
with forms for perfect meaning have the full range of meaning listed here. In Abun, the
particle re covers the meaning of the first three types of perfect. Example 7.5b is a perfect-of­
result type in that a present state is referred to as being the result of some past situation, as
defined by Comrie ( 1 976: 56). In this case it indicates that Fredik is stil l in Sorong, whereas
7.5a does not necessarily imply that. Normally in unmarked cases, the present time is
implied unless another time is indicated by the context.
1 24                                                                                              CHAPTER 7
    7.5 a.      Fredik      mu         ma     Dam.
                Fredik go      LOC Sorong
                Fredik went tolis going to Sorong.          b.    Fredik     mu          ma      Dam        reo
                Fredik go      LOC Sarong PERF
                Fredik has gone to Sorong.
          C.    Fredik     mu          ma      Dam        mo      reo
                Fredik go      LOC Sorong LOC                     PERF
                Fredik has been to Sorong.
    A second type of perfect is experiential perfect, which Comrie ( 1 976:58) defines as a
perfect aspect which ""indicates that a given situation has held at \east once during some time
in the past up to the present"". For this aspect an additional particle, the general locative
preposition ma, directly precedes reo This means that, in example 7.5c for example, Fredik
has been to Sorong at some time (that is, he has experienced going to Sorong), but where he
is now is not under discussion.
    For perfect aspect, Comrie ( 1 976:53) says that it may be present, which expresses a
relation between present state and past situation; past, which expresses a relation between a
past state and an earlier situation: or future, which expresses a relation between a future state
and a situation prior to it. Examples in Abun of present perfect are seen in examples 7 . 1 b and
7 .5b. The form of past perfect, however, is expressed only in a complex sentence, where re
occurs with sa, such as in 7.6.
    7.6         Damingas git                mbem      dik       ne    ar           re     sa
                Domingas         eat        plate     one       DEf   completely   PERF   when.RFAL
                Gerad bi               im           mao
                Gerad poss mother come
                When Dorningas had eaten one plate (of food), Gerad' s mother came.
   The perfect in Abun is understood from the context (so example 7.7 can be in either future
or present time), or may be clarified by the use of temporal phrases, like bere in 7 . 8 .
    7.7         Ii      ben j i     bi     nggwe reo
                I SG do        I SG poss garden PERF
                1 . I will have been working in my garden.
