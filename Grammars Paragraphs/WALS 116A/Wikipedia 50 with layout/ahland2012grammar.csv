7.2.1.1 The Affirmative Marker and Question Constructions
        Lack of the affirmative morpheme with a final rise in intonation generally
indicates a Yes/No question (7.66). In SoG, one must also add the Yes/No question
marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ to the end of the clause (7.67) (see also section 7.3.2).",[236]

affirmative marker acceptable as a Yes/No question.",[236]

               ‘I will stab you with my uncle’s rooster’s claw.’       The incorporated dative can indicate reason or cause. As question words/phrases
denoting reason or cause are formed with a dative prepositional phrase, the incorporated
preposition appears to index these causal obliques. The dative preposition is used as part
of a complex word used to express ‘why?’ and ‘because’ ká-ts(á) / kâ-nts(á) (for what?).
Consider the questions (a) and respective responses (b) in (7.116) and (7.117). The
dative /ká-/ of the question word corresponds to the dative suffix on the verb in both
(7.116a) and (7.117a). Likewise, the dative form in the answer, whether as part of the
purposive (7.116b) or part of the question word, correlates to the dative affix on the verb
of the question. Alternatively, the dative form is part of the repeated “question word” in
the answer with the meaning ‘because’ (7.117b).","[250, 251]"

               ‘Did you go?’         For content questions, a question morpheme often takes the place of the
affirmative on the conjugated verb (7.69, 7.70). In SoG, the question words are not
bound and the affirmative marker can remain on the verb with all arguments that are
questioned. Some examples are given in (7.71) through (7.73). When either the S or O
arguments are questioned in SoG, the affirmative marker does not need to occur (7.74,
7.75).","[236, 237]"

7.3.   Clitics
       There are at least four enclitics found on fully inflected verb forms in Gumuz, two
of which are only found in SoG: the Yes/No question clitic and the clitic indicating
perfect aspect. Both dialects have the negative clitic /=ŋgó/ but the Sirba Abay
subdialect (SoG) has a distinct form /=cê/. A hearsay clitic is present in both dialects as
well. Clitics in Gumuz are phonologically bound in that tonal downstep of H tones does
not occur between the verb (or noun) and the enclitic, and there exists no phonological
pause between morphemes. However, the final /a/ on the word to which it attaches is
pronounced [a] instead of [ə] as though the vowel were in word-final position (see
Chapter II). All known clitics, with the exception of the aspectual clitic in SoG, occur on
nouns as well as verbs in Gumuz. The Yes/No question particle is a clause final clitic
while the remaining enclitics are word-final.","[269, 270]"

prepositional element of the question word ‘why?’ Again, the dative prefix occurs on the

 There is overlap between baa(ʔ) and baané for the proximal demonstrative. Thus, similar to the problem
of overlap in NoG (láná~látá), the medial demonstrative baané may be merging with the proximal
demonstrative. In Kamashi, baa(ʔ) and baané can function as pronouns or adjectives. At least one speaker
used these interchangeably for the proximal when using a demonstrative pronoun and a demonstrative
adjective in reference to the same person: baaʔ, dua baané, bátságá ‘This one, this child went.’                                                    112

         The variation between oodé and oor(á) ‘who?’ in SoG is due to dialectal variation
within SoG; Gumuz speakers from the Sirba variety tend to use oodé while speakers from
the Kamashi area tend to use oor(á). On the other hand, the variation between the nasal
and vowel in ats(é) / nts(é) ‘what?’8 exists for a single speaker in NoG (4.5, 4.20 -
4.23) . 9 It is not clear what causes this variation. When comparing constructions in
examples (4.5) and (4.20-4.22), it appears as though the nts questions a core argument (A,
S, or O), while ats questions all other (unmarked) arguments. For example, the verb ‘say’
is intransitive. Therefore, when questioning what was said, ats must be used (4.22).
However, data is sparse.","[141, 142]"

1.5.2. Bender Classifications
        After having collected additional data on Gumuz, Bender (1981) concluded that
Gumuz appeared to be quite divergent from the other so-called Koman languages and
thus even began to question the subgrouping he had tentatively proposed in 1976.
Commenting on its lack of similarity to “Koman” languages, Bender (1979) states,
        I found 10% or less common basic lexicon between Gumuz and
        Koman languages in one study…and 8% or less in another.
        Comparisons with other languages are even weaker. Grammatically,                                             22
           the case is not much better. At this point, Gumuz may be best
           considered a possible isolate in Sahelian 22 -- perhaps not even a
           Sahelian language at all (1979:40).","[51, 52]"

   The word for ‘mother’ in isolation eá (SoG, see footnote 18) should have an LL tonal melody(ea) given
the tonal melody in (4.51). Thus, I suspect that the LH form given in isolation is a back-formation from
either the Associative Construction (in which an H tone associates with the final vowel of the first noun) or
from the Possessive Construction in which many possessive suffixes begin with a floating H tone.
18
  Not all inherently possessed nouns are obligatorily marked with a possessive suffix. The one exception is
‘mother’ eá which was only uttered without a possessive marker when I questioned a SoG Gumuz language
consultant during elicitation. There exist a few exceptions to these possessive suffixes being limited to
body part terms and kinship terms in SoG, namely eba ‘home area’ which can take either the possessive
suffix endings or the genitive pronoun.",[150]

"        In another construction, the same form ats(é)= attaches to nouns adding the
meaning ‘simply, just, only’ for emphasis. In this same construction, nts(é)= cannot be
substituted for ats(é)=, and ats(é)= no longer functions as an interrogative pronoun
(4.24, 4.25). On the other hand, speakers of SoG consistently use ats(é) for ‘what?’ if
they are from Sirba Abay or Agelo Met’i wereda (county) (4.26, 4.27), while speakers of
SoG from Kamashi wereda consistently use nts(é)= for ‘what?’ (4.28, 4.29).10

possible to pluralize the interrogative pronoun when it is used to question a core
argument (4.34). Examples for NoG are from Innocenti (2010:53-54). 13            NoG
     (4.30) m-olə-lì     l-u-w-ea?
            PL-who-COP REL-3PL.INTR-go.away-TWRD
            ‘Who (pl.) is it that came?’            NoG
     (4.31) mə-n̩ts-ia    ahəmama?
            PL-what-COP 3PL
            ‘What (pl.) are they?’

  Example (4.27) is taken from The New Testament in Gumuz (Matthew 6 ː31). The original Ethiopic
script used in the Gumuz New Testament is transliterated into the semi-phonemic system used in this
dissertation. Tone was also added according to my knowledge of similar constructions in SoG.","[143, 144]"

feminine nouns. According to Innocenti (2010:133), the lexeme éefə́háŋzha means
“uomo di razza bianca” (person of the white race) and the translation for another Gumuz
lexeme, éntúzhea (with a similar prefix), is “uomo di razza agaw”(person of the Agau
race). It is most likely therefore that the prefix/noun in question for ‘white foreigner’
does indeed come from eá ‘mother’ but with reference to lineage and not to a feminine
class of nouns.
        Other forms listed in Table 3.5 have (possible) cognates in the related Koman
languages which lack this (presumed) feminine prefix. For example Gumuz ‘spider’
jántátóŋwá is cognate with tʼútɔ́ɔý ɔ́ ‘flea’ in Gwama (Lockwood 2006). 24 Likewise,
Gumuz éénkááraanza ‘dung beetle’ is kwáánza in Gwama (Lockwood 2006) (aanza is
‘feces’ in Gumuz). Lastly, Gumuz ‘lizard’ éékolíá is súkúlé in T’wampa (Uduk) (Beam
& Cridland 1979).
        Further investigation is needed to determine if Gumuz did indeed have a gender-
based (or feminine based) noun class system at one time and/or whether the presumed
feminine prefix once functioned as a diminutive (or otherwise). It appears, however, that
these perhaps ancient gender prefixes do not mark natural gender synchronically for at
least some of these words in Table 3.5. For éélúŋgwá ‘pig’ (SoG), the initial /éé/ is
maintained when the sex of the animal is specified: ‘boar (male pig)’ is ood-éélúŋgwá and
‘sow (female pig)’ is eákʼw-éélúŋgwá. As of yet, there is no known evidence of an ancient
masculine noun class other than nouns which merely begin with a labio-velar
approximate or a round vowel.","[128, 129]"

3.2.    Nominal Inflection
        Nouns in Gumuz can be (but are not often) inflected for number (discussed below)
and can be inflected for case (to be covered in Chapter XIII). In addition, nouns in NoG
and SoG can be marked with possessive pronoun suffixes (described in detail in section
4.2.2 of Chapter IV, “Pronouns”). Following is a position class diagram for inflectional
morphemes on the noun word in both NoG and SoG:                                 (Case)-(Number)-[Noun Stem]        As just mentioned, nouns in Gumuz are not often marked for number. Instead,
context and/or verbal inflection is used to determine number. 2 Compare the following:             NoG
    (3.1)    mbáándá ɓaga gúmíza é-lá        d-a-ŋgaʃ-áts
             two     person Gumuz like-this AFF-3SG.TR-speak-BODY
             ‘Two Gumuz people told (me) so.’    (3.2)    ɓaga é-lá       d-a-ŋgaʃ-áts

             ‘Someone told (me) so.’    (3.3)    d-úu-ts          á-ɓaga       ká=gó-ɓaaŋgá
             AFF-3PL.INTR-go NOM-person DAT=place-monitor.lizard
             ‘The people went to the monitor lizard (approached the monitor lizard).’        The fact that number is not generally inflectionally marked in Gumuz nouns, as
demonstrated in examples (3.1-3.3), has caused scholars to question the placement of
Gumuz within the Nilo-Saharan (N-S) family. Within Nilo-Saharan, a tripartite nominal
system of singulative (i.e. overt morpheme or stem shape for singular but zero for plural),
plurative (i.e. overt morpheme or stem shape for plural but zero for singular), and
replacive (i.e. overt morphemes or stem shapes for both singular and plural) marking is
widespread and is found in three of the six major original subfamilies proposed by2
  Regarding examples (3.1-3.3), certain dialects within both NoG and SoG have a singular weak suppletive
form for ‘person (SG)’: /baha/ or /baχa/.","[100, 101]"
"       Mikkola (1999), a both quantitative (statistical) and qualitative study, claims that
there are serious doubts about Gumuz sharing any significant lexical elements with Nilo-
Saharan. Regarding these doubts Mikkola comments, “…the inclusion of questionable
units, at least Songai and Kuliak, plus Gumuz, could not be substantiated” (1999.:130).
He provides a tentative Nilo-Saharan classification with Gumuz as a possible
independent family outside of Nilo-Saharan.
        Dimmendaal (2008:843) raised doubts about Gumuz and the Koman subfamily,
commenting that that their genetic status is “debatable” as they are lacking some of the
more widespread Nilo-Saharan morphological markers. But he concludes that their
“debatable” status is likely due to lack of data for these languages. Dimmendaal (2011:
297) later refers to Gumuz as an “isolate”.
       (Ahland 2010b) revisited the question of Gumuz as a possible language isolate,
concluding that it is most likely a part of the Nilo-Saharan (N-S) super family. Gumuz
exhibits eleven of the forty-six retentions for N-S proposed by Greenberg (1963) and
later modified by Bender (1989, 1991). Despite the relatively low number of N-S
retentions, the classifier system in Gumuz may be a link to some of the more pronounced
typological features of Nilo-Saharan such as number-marking, case-marking, and
Greenberg’s ‘movable k’. While Dimmendaal notes that Gumuz lacks the archaic
typological feature of tripartite number marking (singulative, plurative, and replacive)
(2000, 2008), Ahland (2010b:15-17) argues that there is reason to believe the tripartite
number marking system is related to the Gumuz classifier system, as these classifiers can
                                              27
also indicate number. In addition, the two most widespread accusative case markers in
N-S (Dimmendaal 2010:30), reconstructed as *-kɔ̀ (Ehret 2001:203) and *-si (Ehret
2001:205), 24 may be related to two of the verbal classifiers in Gumuz. Lastly, the class
morpheme /kʼoá-/ (CL1ːHEAD) has a similar distribution to and appears to be cognate
with Greenberg’s ‘movable k’ prefix (1963, 1981) found throughout N-S languages.
         In addition to positing a possible historical relationship to the three typological
features of N-S noted above, (Ahland 2010b) also finds that at least one classifier in
Gumuz (/-Vc/, /cá-/ CL1ːEYE) encompasses a nearly identical idiosyncratic semantic
class to the ‘object reference marker’-s(I) found in Fur, a N-S language of Sudan. 25 Table
1.1 demonstrates the semantic categories represented in the two languages.","[56, 57]"

10.4.1 Ditransitive Clauses
         In Gumuz, it is not possible to have three simple NPs in a clause that has
ditransitive semantics, 4 though it is possible to have two NPs plus a prepositional phrase.
The major question is whether there are any verbs, either simple or derived, that require
three participants syntactically. At this point, the evidence is not yet clear.
         A ditransitive clause is a clause with three arguments, one functioning as subject,
one functioning as primary/direct object and the third functioning as a secondary/indirect
object, depending on the language. The three arguments are overtly required or at least
must have a definite null interpretation to be considered ditransitive (Fillmore et al.
2003). In Gumuz, there are no known clear examples of ditransitive verbal roots. Even
with the verb cá ‘give’ (NoG and SoG), which can be part of what might be considered a
ditransitive clause (10.28), to have a required third argument, the verb must carry an
incorporated preposition (10.31, 10.32). Without an incorporated preposition, either the
theme (10.29) or the recipient (10.30) is structurally optional. This is true for both SoG
and NoG dialects. In (10.28-10.30), the tone on the bound pronominal suggests that a
grammatical object is present, but in (10.29) any additional PP coding the recipient is not
required. There is no clear evidence in Gumuz that ditransitive verbal roots exist.","[370, 371]"

1.1.       The Gumuz Language
1.1.1. Location
           Gumuz is spoken in the Blue Nile valley (and the valleys of its tributaries) of
northwestern Ethiopia and the Roseires Dam area of southeastern Sudan (Republic of the
Sudan). The Gumuz people number 159,418 in Ethiopia (Ethiopian Census 2007) and
approximately 40,000 in Sudan (Lewis 2009). The language/dialect cluster extends as far
north as the district of Metemma in the Amhara region of Ethiopia and as far south as the
village of Dimt’u in the Benishangul-Gumuz region. It is spoken as far east as the
Mandura district to the north of the Blue Nile and as far west as the Roseires area along
the Blue Nile in Sudan (Bryan 1945, Jordan 2002). This entire area is not exclusively
occupied by the Gumuz people as they share much of the land with the Boro (Shinasha),
Bertha, Oromo, Amhara, Kunfel, and Awi 2 (Awngi speakers). However, the last four
groups tend to live in the highlands, while the Gumuz remain in the lowlands.
           Figure 1.1 below is a language map of Gumuz, covering areas in both Ethiopia
and Sudan. An approximate border of where the Gumuz language is spoken is given in
green with red lines indicating major roads and blue lines for rivers. Not much is known,
however, about the Gumuz people and language in Sudan (indicated by question marks
on the map) other than brief accounts given by Schuver (1883), Bryan (1945) and James
(1977). The best approximation regarding their location in Sudan was provided in Bryan
1945 which included place names, longitude and latitude. In addition, Linda Jordan
interviewed some native Gumuz speakers at the Yarenja refugee camp in western
Ethiopia which is located along the Blue Nile just north of where the Biles and Blue Nile
rivers converge. All claimed to be from villages/towns located in and around the Blue
Nile Valley of the Sudan up to Er Roseires: Magaanza, Alman, Jarada, and “Riserisi”
(Jordan 2002) (presumably the last place name is Er Roseires). Around the turn of the last
century, a small group of Gumuz numbering around 1,000 were relocated south to an area
just outside the town of Welk’it’e by orders of Menelik, the emperor of Ethiopia (Bender

across the border in southeastern Sudan. This study compares the phonology and
selected aspects of the grammar of two major dialects within the Gumuz cluster:
Northern Gumuz (NoG) and Southern Gumuz (SoG), both of which are spoken in the
Benishangul-Gumuz Region of western Ethiopia. Analysis is based on twenty months of
fieldwork in Ethiopia conducted from September of 2007 through April of 2009.
Language data was gathered from thirty-three native speakers of Gumuz: fourteen from
NoG and nineteen from SoG. The Gumuz language consultants provided a total of sixty-
eight texts of varying lengths and multiple genres, thirty-four texts from NoG and thirty-
four texts from SoG. In addition, a list of approximately two thousand words was
collected from each dialect as well as countless hours of elicited language data. To aid in
further comparison, I worked with two additional Gumuz language consultants from
Yaso wereda 1 eliciting several hours of language data and one text. To date, this is the
first description of Gumuz which analyzes and compares the grammar and phonology of
the two main dialects - that of the north and that of the south. In addition, this description
includes the first tonal analysis of any Gumuz dialect.
         This first chapter gives an overview of the Gumuz language, where it is spoken, a
description of the dialect cluster, Gumuz culture, history, and migrations. It also includes
a review of previous descriptions of the Gumuz language and the various attempts to
classify it. Chapter II provides a description of the phonological inventories of NoG and
SoG, phonological rules, and a discussion of tonal contrasts as well as tonal downstep
and related rules. Chapter III covers the basic shape and phonology of simple noun words

 A wereda is a political division roughly equivalent to a county in the United States. Ethiopian regions are
divided into zones, which are further divided into weredas. A wereda, in turn, is divided into smaller units
called k’ebeles.","[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

clause is semantically negative, both the conditional clause and the consequent clause use

positive, the conditional clause will be introduced with /éé-/ (13.13). However, as shown
in (13.16) a negative hypothetical event in which the verb of the conditional clause is
affirmative and the verb of the consequent clause is negative is also possible with the
hypothetical n- construction.","[466, 467]"

      Affirmative commands do not use any form of the ma- construction. Furthermore,
the affirmative commands use two distinct constructions. The first and second persons
follow what I call an ‘imperative’ form and third person follows a ‘jussive’ form. The
imperative is formed with the verb root followed by a bound subject pronominal plus
other possible stem morphology (e.g. directional, IN/Classifier). The jussive is formed
with the prefix /n-/ or /l-/ (for some speakers of NoG) followed by a bound third person
subject pronominal plus the verb stem (see also Example 8.124 of Chapter VII). For
comparison with negative commands, Tables 11.3 and 11.4 provide imperative and
jussive forms of ‘go’ in NoG and SoG respectively.",[411]

  The word for ‘guest’ would not be an exception to vowel lengthening if one considers that /koa/ [kwə] is
realized as [ko] (or [ku]) when a consonant follows. Thus, [kodóχwá] ‘guest’ must be /koadóχwá/ or
/koadóχwá/ underlyingly. Otherwise, one would expect the /o/ to lengthen (or not be subject to this
lengthening process at all, considering that /a/ is the only known vowel to undergo lengthening to mark
plural). The other alternative is to assume that /-á-/ is a plural infix for this subset of nouns (similar to
Chadic). This analysis has its merits since it explains the addition of H tone. See also the discussion of
vowel length contrasts in Chapter II.

  The words for ‘my older brother’ and ‘my older sister’ are multimorphemic with the /-mâ / 1SG POSS
suffix. Also, ‘older brothers’ is an apparent exception to the first /a/ vowel being lengthened. However, if
all of these lexemes are polymorphemic historically, it may be that the final /a/ of the first (historical)
morpheme is lengthened.

  Some speakers of SoG who produce the reduplicated form in 3.18 can also use the ḿ̩ á- plural prefix on
the same noun outside of a N-N compound: ḿ̩ á-gwinzá (PL-male) ‘males’.",[107]

two bare objects. Indirect objects are marked with the prepositional proclitic ka=.
However, it could be the case that ‘belly’ and ‘house’ form a nominal compound which
functions as the O argument and that ‘belly’ is not incorporated into the verb. Indeed
there exists a nominal compound: líí-mátsʼá (belly-house) ‘floor’. However, one can see
that ‘belly’ forms a phonological unit with ‘house’ in this NN compound as the vowel
and the consonant metathesize. In contrast, when forming a phonological unit with the
verb, ‘belly’ maintains its vowel-consonant structure: -ííl.13 In Southern Gumuz, however,
such a metathesis does not occur as the initial vowel-consonant structure is often found in
the noun stem as well as in the IN. Thus, other (syntactic) evidence would be necessary
for this dialect to demonstrate that the noun root contiguous with the verb root and the
following O argument do not actually form a NN compound. Indeed, both incorporation
and compounding are possible in Gumuz for clauses with (nearly) identical translations.
But there are clear differences between the structures as shown both by phonology and
negative placement. In (8.29a), the noun ílúkʼwá ‘head’ is incorporated into the verb stem.
However, in (8.29b) ílúkʼwá ‘head’ forms a compound with hosa ‘cow’14 and this
compound functions as the O argument. Both clauses can propositionally mean ‘Skin the
cow’s head’. In Gumuz, the negative =ŋg̩ ó is an enclitic that attaches to both nouns and
verbs. Examples (8.30 a-b) provide the negative forms of the commands in (8.29 a-b),
demonstrating that there is a word boundary between ‘head’ and ‘cow’ in example
(8.29a). On the other hand, the word boundary in (8.29b) is after the verb root kóɗ ‘skin’
as demonstrated with its negative form in (8.30b). Thus, (8.29a) and (8.30a) must have
INs in the verb stem as the negative enclitic should not separate the two noun roots of a
NN compound.","[284, 285]"

Below are the variations from one Kamashi speaker in polite versus impolite negative
forms of CV H tone verb roots in SoG. In the affirmative, the 2SG imperative
counterparts are : tsá ‘goǃ’, sá ‘eatǃ’, and fá ‘drinkǃ’. 1414
  One explanation for the variation in tone for the Strong vs. Polite conjugation of CV verb roots is that
these roots may be toneless with a H tone added in the 2SG imperative form. That is, the roots tsa ‘go’ and
sa ‘eat’ may not be assigned tone but H tone is added for the 2SG imperative form. It is also possible that                                                   383

7.3.1. Negative Clitics
       There exist two negative clitics: /=ŋgó/, which is used in both NoG and SoG and
/=cê/, which is used by Gumuz speakers living in and around Sirba Abay wereda
(county) as well as parts of Wenbera and Agelo Met’i weredas. These clitics are
restricted to attaching to main clause verbs (7.185-7.187); when negating a subordinate
clause, one must use (with some exceptions) a negative auxiliary (see Chapter XI,                                            241
examples 11.64, 11.65). Also, as stated previously in section 7.2.1.2, the negative clitic
does not normally co-occur with the affirmative prefix.","[270, 271]"

               ... (these are) what we plow with.’       When the verb stem is intransitive, the RC construction (for relativizing on
objects of comitative/instrumental prepositions) is similar to RCs which relativize on an S
argument; the bound subject pronominal on the RC verb demonstrates an intransitive
tonal pattern (12.81). As mentioned above, the RC must be postnominal. For transitive
verbs, the verb of the RC exhibits a transitive tonal pattern. Similar to clauses
relativizing on A arguments, a /-a/ suffix is added to the verb of the RC if the O argument
is part of the RC and either precedes the verb or is not overt. In (12.81), the O argument
‘field’ of the second RC is understood and is indicated with the /-a/ suffix. If the O
argument is overt and follows the verb, no /-a/ suffix is needed as with the RC of (12.80)
and the first RC of (12.82).
       When relativizing on the object of a dative preposition, the dative preposition /ká/
is incorporated into the RC verb. This is demonstrated in (12.83) within a question
construction. An incorporated dative preposition can be used to indicate cause or reason
(see Chapter VII). The construction in (12.83) is relativizing on the reason for someone’s
actions represented by the interrogative pronoun ‘what’. The incorporated dative
indicates that ‘what’ is the object of the dative, meaning ‘for what?’. As the verb of the
RC is intransitive, the tonal pattern on the bound subject pronominal reflects an
intransitive tonal pattern, namely L tone for 2SG.

        Lastly, one can also relativize on the object of a locative preposition using either
the bare relativizer strategy or the relative pronoun plus relativizer strategy. The
incorporated locative suffix is added to the verb of the RC and the object of the locative
is the head of a postnominal RC. The RC in (12.84) is transitive while the one in (12.85)
is intransitive.

        The relative pronoun /gw-/ ‘where, place where’ may be the only true relative
pronoun in NoG if one assumes that a relative pronoun is a relativizer which reflects one
or more features of its co-referent. The other relative pronouns /dá(á)-/ and /etá-/ only
maintain features of their co-referents (number, animacy) in nominalized RCs (and
/dá(á)-/ is not used in finite RCs). The relative pronoun /gw-/, on the other hand,
maintains the features of ‘place’ or location in both finite and non-finite RCs.
        RCs introduced with /gw-/ can have a head or be headless (12.89). If there exists
an overt head, the RC is often postnominal (12.86, 12.87). However, the RC can also be
prenominal (12.88). The tonal pattern on the bound subject pronominal of the verb
follows that of main clause verbs. Lastly, the headless RC can also function as a
complement clause. In (12.89), the RCs ‘where he lay down’ and ‘where he died’ are
functioning as O arguments of the matrix verb ‘find’. 20
20
  The classifier /-ats/ CL:BODY on ‘find’ in (12.89) suggests that the O argument is body-like or has a
body. Thus, it may be that ‘hyena’ is the implied O argument and not the locations ‘where he lay down’
and ‘where he died’.","[447, 448, 449]"

6.1     The Associative Construction: N H N D
        The Associative Construction in Gumuz is a NN collocation in which the second
nominal of the compound modifies the first nominal. The semantics of this construction
convey possession/association of the sort ‘N of N’ but it is distinct from the Genitive
Construction (see discussion in section 6.1.1). Similar to the “associative construction”
described by Welmers (1973:275-276), mainly for the “Niger-Kordofanian” languages,
the range of meanings for the Associative Construction found in Gumuz is much broader
than that of the Genitive Construction, covering possession, material, contents, and
function/purpose.1
1
  Similar constructions in Nilo-Saharan have been labeled “anti-genitive” for Päri (Andersen 1988:284) and
Bert(h)a (Andersen 1995, Benishangul-Gumuz Language Development Project 2007:207), “modified noun
form” for Anywa (Reh 1996:116), and “status constructus” (Tucker and Bryan 1966:83) among others.",[180]

2.3.2 Nasal Insertion and Velar Weakening
        NoG and SoG demonstrate a regular sound correspondence between the uvular
fricative (in NoG) and the velar nasal (in SoG). I had previously identified this sound
change as *ŋ > h (Ahland 2004). However, there is reason to believe that the sound in
proto-Gumuz was a voiceless velar stop *k. In Ahland (2004: 82), this hypothesis was
presented as an alternative analysis but initially rejected based on the complexity of the
analysis. I now believe that this unusual sound correspondence may be reflexes of nasal
insertion before velars in SoG, and the weakening of the voiceless velar from *k > Ø in
SoG (following nasal insertion), and *k > h > χ in NoG. Thus, the etyma corresponding
                                             63
to the regular sound correspondence in Table 2.14 would be *kʼaka ‘crocodile’, *tika ‘ant’,
*ɓak ‘hunt’, and *uka ‘fish (n)’.","[92, 93]"

11.4. Negative Commands
         What I label a ‘negative command’ in Gumuz includes both the negative of
imperative forms as well as the negative of jussive forms. Negative imperative and
jussive forms are structurally the same: /ka-/ INSTR + ma- construction + bound subject
pronominal + negative enclitic in NoG and ma- construction + bound subject pronominal
+ negative enclitic in SoG. The 2SG form is often unmarked in SoG (11.80). 13 I gloss the
resulting /kama-/ (NoG) and corresponding /ma-/ (SoG) prefixes as NEG.IMP (negative
imperative).

lexical to more grammatical, with free nouns on the lexical end of the continuum and
verbal affixes on the grammatical end. Table 9.4 outlines this range of syntactic
behaviors. The one problem between this table and a grammaticalization continuum is
the location of ‘class morpheme’ on the continuum. Nominal class morphemes are
possibly more toward the lexical end of the continuum than are verbal classifiers but
placed in Table 9.4 based on the range of syntactic behaviors found.
        The NoG variety was chosen for the data in this table as this variety includes both
complex and simple noun stems as classifiers and class morphemes. Thus, the range of
syntactic behaviors is the most extensive. All verbal classifier forms are included in Table
9.4, while only representative forms for other morphemes are included. For example,
waagá, a species of mushroom, is merely representative of all nouns which exhibit no
classifier syntax or classifying function nor can function as a head root in a NN
compound. 55 In the same way, ‘bone’ represents all nouns which can act as a head noun
in NN compound but do not form a strong class or category in the language (nor co-occur
with a verbal classifier of the same nominal origin). The ‘mouth’ and ‘place’ morphemes
are included in this table as they questionably form classes in the language. Finally,
morphemes such as cá ‘eye’, kʼwá ‘head’, -(V)ts ‘body’ (and possibly gwá ‘place’) have
grammaticalized beyond their noun classifying functions to verbal affixes which mark
various abstract and clausal arguments and have developed other syntactic functions
(discussed further in Chapters VII and X).","[358, 359]"

        A negative circumstantial adverbial clause is a dependent clause expressing an
event that did not or will not happen before the event of the matrix clause. These are
often translated into English as ‘without X-ing, ...’ In NoG, the construction for negative
adverbials is as follows: /kaʒiigá=/ + /mâ-/ (an abbreviated form of the purpose prefix) +
the verb root + any applicable morphemes ordered according to the future tense (13.24).
The /kaʒiigá=/ clitic appears to be comprised of the instrumental preposition /ka=/
followed by the verb root ʒiig ‘be poor, be without’. The final /á/ in this clitic complex is                                              440
likely a remnant from the dative proclitic /ká=/ which forms the purposive prefix /káma-/
or /kám -/̀ (see Chapter 11). The /kaʒiigá=/ clitic is also found with NPs meaning
‘without’ or ‘except’ (13.25).","[469, 470]"

9.2 Class Morphemes
        One distinct category of nominal compounds in Gumuz, which may hold the key
to the origins of verbal classifiers in Gumuz, is that of class morpheme compounds.
These are often found within nominal compounds, similar to those found in English, e.g.
man: mailman, policeman etc. This use of class morphemes in Gumuz appears to be
related to emphasis or focus, but also may be used for quantifying nouns (to some
extent).
        In Gumuz the class morphemes appear to be historically related to the simple root
forms of the verbal classifiers. Having the same (or similar) class morpheme on verbs as
well as on nouns is similar to what Aikhenvald (2000:204) labels ‘multiple classifier
systems’ in which the same set of classifying morphemes can be used in more than one
classifier environment. The main difference is that the Gumuz class morphemes may not
be “prototypical” classifiers per the extant linguistic literature on classifiers. Nonetheless,
the few class morphemes that have been documented in Gumuz have many of the
properties of noun classifiers, both ‘definitional’ (i-iii) and ‘contingent’ (iv-vi) as outlined
by Aikhenvald (2000:81):        i) their presence in a noun phrase is independent of other constituents inside or
            outside it.        ii) their scope is a noun phrase.        iii) they are a type of non-agreeing noun categorization device whose choice is

9.2.1 Class Morphemes and Verbal Classifiers
         Class morphemes are classifying morphemes which form compounds with certain
nouns. These compounds are structurally similar to NN compounds (of the Associative
Construction, Chapter VI) with the class morpheme functioning as the initial noun head.
They differ from NN compounds in that the class morpheme compound can have the
same referent with or without the class morpheme. In (9.120), one can say ‘tomorrow’
                                              301
either with or without the class morpheme cá- ‘eye’ which classifies units of time in
addition to mass nouns, etc. 32                  NoG
     (9.120)      d-éé-f-árá            ka=maŋgwa ~ ka=cá-maŋgwa
                  AFF-FUT-drink-1SG.TR COM=morrow      COM=CL:EYE-morrow
                  ‘I will drink (something) tomorrow.’         Class morphemes in Gumuz differ from “prototypical” noun classifiers in that
they are not very productive. Gumuz verbal classifiers, in contrast, arose from the same
source body part nouns as class morphemes but are more productive as noun
categorization devices. There is also evidence of a synchronic (syntactic) relationship
between the two.
         As we have seen, class morphemes in NN compounds appear to affect the choice
of verbal classifier on the verb. 33 This is analogous to the syntactic behavior of class
term compounds in Tai languages (DeLancey 1986) in that both class term compounds of
Tai langauges and class morpheme compounds in Gumuz tend to co-occur with their
classifier counterparts. The main difference, however, is that the classifiers in Tai
languages are numeral classifiers whereas the classifiers in Gumuz are verbal classifiers.
In example (9.28) of section 9.1.1.1, the nominal compound with the class morpheme
/kʼwá-/ ‘head’ combined with the noun root ‘rock’ appeared as the O argument of the verb
‘heat’. The choice of verbal classifier on the verb, therefore, was /-ílúkʼw/ ‘head’ in
accordance with the class morpheme.
         Likewise, ‘bone’ can be expressed either as a compound with a class morpheme
or as the simple root ʒákwá ‘bone’ without the class morpheme /kʼwá-/ ‘head’. 34 With the
32
   While the language consultant could not see any semantic difference between the two forms of
‘tomorrow’ in (9.120), I suspect that the phrase involving the class morpheme may indicate a more
punctual or exact point in time.
33
   The co-existence of, in addition to the agreement between, these two systems of classification is likely
significant in the historic development of verbal classifiers in Gumuz. In Tai, it has been documented that
classifiers originated as class terms (DeLancey 1986) which could be the case for Gumuz.
34
  kʼwá-ʒákʼwá ‘head-bone’ is a class morpheme compound and does not refer to ‘skull’ as one might
suspect. The word for ‘skull’ requires what could be called an associative construction with ‘bone’ as the
head of the compound and ‘head’ following: ʒákʼwá-lúkʼwá ‘bone-head’.","[330, 331]"

11.2.2.           Complements of Negative Auxiliaries
          To negate a subordinate clause verb in Gumuz (save a few exceptions), one must
use a negative auxiliary in place of the negative enclitics =ŋgó (NoG, SoG-Kamashi) or
=cê (SoG-Sirba Abay) that are used for main clause verbs (see Chapter VII for further
discussion of negative enclitics). There exist two negative auxiliaries ko and batsʼ(-áʃ),
both of which are used in SoG (11.49, 11.60, 11.61), while only batsʼ is used in NoG
(11.43, 11.59). For most subordinate clauses, the complement of these negative
auxiliaries is a non-finite form of the ma- construction. 11

  Example (11.60) is translated directly from Amharic. As the construction in Amharic uses ‘say’ in a
clause chain, I believe the consultant translated the sentence literally and the sentence can be said without a
‘say’ construction in Gumuz. However, ‘say’ in Gumuz (as in Amharic) often indicates intent.","[403, 404]"

       This chapter describes various types of functional adverbial clauses found in
Gumuz. Some adverbial clauses utilize the ma- construction which was introduced in
Chapter XI, but others do not. Temporal and conditional (and some causal) adverbial
clauses are simply introduced with an erstwhile preposition followed by a finite verbal
form. Some temporal and conditional clauses involve the morpheme /gó-/ found in
relator noun constructions (Chapter III) as well as ‘where’/‘place’ relative clauses
(Chapter XII). Adverbial clauses involving hypothetical and/or counterfactual events are
formed with a finite form of the ma- construction combined with the affirmative prefix
and other possible erstwhile prepositions. Yet other adverbial clauses can be introduced
with a distinct phonological words/phrases (or clitics) meaning ‘at the time of’ and
‘because’, and ‘without’. Lastly, purpose adverbial clauses are introduced with the prefix
     ̀ whether nonfinite or finite. This last prefix is a combination of the
/kám -/,
dative/benefactive /ká=/ preposition plus the ma- nominalizing prefix (of the ma-
construction). Purposive clauses in NoG can also be formed with the /ká=/ prefix
followed by /gó-/ plus the ma- construction.
       The following sections are organized by function and not by structure. Section
13.1 describes temporal adverbial clauses, section 13.2 describes conditional adverbial
clauses, section 13.3 describes concessive adverbial clauses, section 13.4 describes
negative circumstantial adverbial clauses, section 13.5 covers causal adverbial clauses,
and section 13.6 describes purpose clauses.","[460, 461]"

prefix. However, the third slot of the construction has the morpheme /la-/ in the negative
adverbial clause (13.26). The structure is as follows: /b-/ + bound subject pronominal +

  To express that someone or something is the cause in NoG, one can use either tʃagwa ‘foot’ or maanɟa
‘fire’ as the first noun in the Associative Construction (Chapter VI) with the second noun functioning as the
cause. With tʃagwa, one must also use the locative preposition ná= and the cause is semantically neutral
(not negative). With maanɟa, the dative preposition ká= is used and the cause is negative (see also
example 13.28 for the metaphor ‘fire’ being used to indicate a ‘problem’). Both of these constructions
roughly translate as ‘because of X’.

       Purpose clauses in Gumuz are formed with the dative ká followed by either a
nonfinite or finite form of the ma- construction. In many cases, these two morphemes
                                      ̀ but the /a/ vowel of the nominalizer /ma-/ deletes
appear to be fused as the prefix /kám -/,
and a floating L tone remains. This floating L tone causes downstep of a following H

SoG (and the immediate future prefix of NoG). In NoG, a purpose clause can also be
formed with ká plus gó (<góá ‘place’) followed by the ma- construction.","[471, 472]"

                           ‘S/he went.’           Other voiced stops in SoG tend to weaken post-vocalically as well. The voiced
bilabial implosive /ɓ/ tends to weaken to an unreleased voiced bilabial stop [b̚] word-
finally, while the voiced bilabial stop /b/ weakens to a fricative (in some dialects) word-
finally (which is in opposition to the final devoicing ‘rule’). 10 This is evidenced in the
near minimal pair /táɓ/ ‘do again’ and /tab/ ‘be thick’ which are pronounced [tə́b̚] and
[təβ] respectively.
           Lastly, speakers of SoG have a tendency towards haplology. That is, a CV
syllable which is (nearly) identical to an adjacent syllable tends to be deleted, especially
if the V of the CV syllable is a short /a/ and carries L tone. For example, the underlying
form of ‘we (exclusive) shouted’ is /b-íla-lúŋg-ágá/ (AFF-1PL.EXCL.INTR-shout-NFUT).
Because the 1PL inclusive morpheme ends with the CV syllable /la/ and the following
syllable begins with /lú/, the first syllable in the sequence is deleted and the word
surfaces as [bílúŋgə́gá].11
10
     The speaker who demonstrated the word-final weakening is from Kamashi town, Kamashi wereda.
11
  This might also be interpreted as deletion of a low toned schwa. However, there is no noticeable
lengthening of the /l/ consonant. Also, haplology in this particular verb results in a near minimal pair with
the 3PL form: bílúŋgəgá. Also noteworthy is that the intransitive tonal pattern in the 1PL EXCL
conjugation is lost.",[75]

            In addition to the incorporated locative indicating (present) perfect aspect
(section 7.2.3.2), there also exists an enclitic (or possibly a phonologically distinct word)
that indicates perfect aspect: nʒígán(á). Uzar (1989:377) identified a similar morpheme
in the Sirba subdialect of SoG, nžiina, and labeled it a “perfective/completive” aspect
marker. While the locative functioning as perfect aspect seems to be restricted to
nonfuture, the nʒígán(á) clitic can be used for nonfuture or future tenses. 26                     SoG
