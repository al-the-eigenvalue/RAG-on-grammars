 6.6 Interrogative There is no complete paradigm of the interrogative documented                         in Old Nobiin
 although we would expect a fully developed paradigm if we look at Modern
 Nobiin. According to Browne (2002:66), interrogative sentences can end in:
 “i         2™ person singular in all examples
 -ha        one example 1* person singular and 3™ person singular respectively The suffixes follow the verb/predicate and personal endings. The question can be
 introduced by an interrogative pronoun, such as is- or mina (for interrogative
 pronouns see 4.4). The terminal particle is optional and can be dropped.
 (M. 9.1)
 anki-min-na-i
 remember-NEG-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG
  ‘don’t you remember?’  An interrogative pronoun can be placed at the beginning of the sentence or
  clause, as in
  (NC 26.10-12)
  mina iru    till-ilogoian    —_ daui-na-i
  what you     god-than           be great-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG
  ‘what? are you greater than god?’
      100
Although the interrogative pronoun is there it is not a wh-type question but a
yes-no one. Second person singular -i seems to be part of a regular interrogative
paradigm which is still present in Modern Nobiin (see below). Suffix -ha, how-
ever, listed by Browne under the same heading is not part of that paradigm. In
the two instances documented, it follows interrogative pronouns, thus addition-
ally marking wh-type questions, as in
(M. 8.14-15)
islo     is-sna-ha

“where was it?’
(ITII 16iii 9-12)
iskaragra-ha [...]           pal-di-re
how-INTERROG [...]           go forth-FUT-ISGPRESIND
‘how will I go forth?’In Modern Nobiin we find two paradigms                               for the interrogative which   Werner
(1987:153) labels interrogative I and II. Interrogative I has a suffix -i for the
2nd person and seems to correspond to the Old Nobiin form. The suffixes of the
interrogative are:
                       Interrogative I Present                Interrogative I] Present

words. Lepsius (1880:102ff.) and Abel (1913:39) document slightly different
forms. Lepsius calls his second paradigm a contracted variant of the first. The
paradigms are:

the other paradigm with wh-type questions. The following sentences exemplify:

Abel (ibd., 44) also lists two paradigms for the interrogative preterit, which cor-
respond to those documented by Werner (1987:154ff.):

 This formation is only documented for the present and future and restricted to Ist
 and 3"" persons singular and plural. It is constructed by suffixing -m to the pre-
 sent or future participles which are assimilated. The personal endings are those
 of the indicative. The resulting forms are:
                      Present                                              Future

 volvement of the subject or the significance of the act. Witnessed action is a
 typical function of the affirmative. Browne’s affirmative seems to correspond to
 Zyhlarz (1928:67) “durative”. Examples are:
(St. 6.12-7.2)

‘and truly, if | do give birth, | shall become Christian’Werner (1987:164) explains the so-called affirmative as an originally interroga-
tive paradigm because of its morpho-tonological structure. As Werner’s infor-
mants insisted, affirmative forms are never understood as questions but as strong
or emphatic affirmation. He regards a negative question with auxiliary min- as
basis for the affirmative construction which later underwent a semantic shift. The
underlying negative question, however, is presumably not ‘you’re not actually
beating?’, as Werner proposes, but ‘is it not that you are beating/aren’t you beat-
ing?’ which was reinterpreted as ‘you’re definitely beating’. In accordance with
Werner, Browne (ibid.) speaks of a ‘collapsed negative’ in Old Nobiin.
   The suffixes of the affirmative in Modern Nobiin are the following:
 Isc         -minee                 IPL        -minoo
2sG          -mi                    2PL        -minoo
3sG          -mi                    3PL        -mina/-minaaIn Modern Nobiin, the paradigm includes second persons singular and plural.
Werner compares his affirmative to Reinisch’s (1879:71) negative question.
Below, Reinisch’s paradigm is given in comparison to the negative question of
Lepsius:
                                                                                                    99

is obvious. Werner (1987:165) didn’t collect a full paradigm for the negative
interrogative but the examples in his sentences document similar forms to those
of Lepsius.
   It can be questioned whether the modern forms given by Werner actually de-
veloped from the Old Nobiin forms. Although they are undoubiedly similar, the
correspondences are by no means regular. The modern forms are evidently based
                                                                                                       mr
on the negative verb men-/min- whereas the old forms go back to an old negative
formant -m-. Unfortunately, there is not much                    textual evidence      from   Modem
Nobiin to analyze its function. Thus, the question concerning the relationship
between the forms has at present to remain open.","[98, 99, 100]"

 13. Appendix: Nubia in the Medieval Millennium —
        the Written Sources
 The Nubian Nile Valley is a region where intensive archaeological research has
 been undertaken which is comparable only to its northern neighbor Egypt. Colin
  Renfrew pointed out that these archaeological investigations also opened up new
 possibilities for linguistic studies: “[...] while we cannot expect to find direct
 evidence in the archaeological record for a specific prehistoric language or lan-
 guage group, we can indeed study processes of demographic and social change
 which we may seek, however hypothetically, to correlate with language change
 in those areas” (1987:264).
      In the 6th century AD, the Christian historiographers began to write about the
 northern Sudan. At first, their main subject was the conversion of Nubia to Chris-
 tianity, later, they were interested in the unique phenomenon of a stable Christian
 kingdom in the immediate neighborhood of Muslim Egypt. When the Muslim
 historiographers and geographers began to write about the region not much later
 they provided an abundance of information about geography, history, politics and
 economy in the northern Sudan. In spite of the many Arab sources, however,
 they conveyed only fragments about the political and social situation in Nubia
 between the 9th and 15th century. For many scholars, the sources seemed, for
example, to prove that Christianity in Nubia and with it the Nubian kingdom
came to an end when the capital Dongola was conquered in 1323. As it is now
known, the kingdom of Dotawo, which is not mentioned in Arab sources, existec
at least until the end of the 15th century.
     In the course of excavations at Qasr Ibrim, numerous Old Nobiin documents
have been found and edited which constitute the basis for the linguistic analyses
of Old Nobiin in this book. Although we are able to translate most of the written
remains, our knowledge of the context is often too inadequate to actually under-
stand what the texts talk about. Adams (1996:244) states: “For the time being
they [the texts] may be said to enrich our picture of mediaeval Nubian life with-
out significantly clarifying it, inasmuch as they raise perhaps as many questions
as they answer.” One of the problems Adams and others seem to find difficult to
deal with stems from the discrepancies between the content of Old Nobiin and
other   written   sources.   These   discrepancies,   however,   are   only   problematic    as                                                                                            219
long as the different sources are taken as reflection of one or more historical
realities. This seems to be the major fallacy of most of the historical work deal-
ing with ancient Nubia.
   1 do not share this rather pessimistic attitude towards the texts and will there-
fore try to evaluate and interpret them with regards to their content. This will be
done against the background of non-Nubian written sources.","[218, 219, 220]"

 13.2 The Historical Background For more than seventy years, scholarly work on the medieval history of northern
 Sudan begins more or less identically with a description of the political circum-
 stances at the beginning of the Christian period in the 6 century. According to
an almost canonical interpretation of written sources, the northern Sudan was
divided into three kingdoms (Monneret de Villard 1938, Crawford 1951, Arkell
1961, Adams 1977, Welsby 2002). From north to south, these kingdoms were
named:
 1. Nobatia (Nobadia), with a northern border at the First Cataract and a southern
    border somewhere south of the Second Cataract. In some of the Arabic sour-
    ces, this kingdom is called a/-Maris. Its capital is Pachoras (Faras).
2. Makuria (Arabic al-Muqurra), directly south of Nobatia. Its southern border is
   also unknown but it is supposed to be located at a place which Arabic sources
   know as al-Abwaab ‘the gates’. The capital of Makuria is Dongola.
3. Alodia (Arabic ’A/wa), between al-Abwaab and the confluence of the two
   Niles, possibly the border was even further south. The capital of Alodia is So-
   ba, close to Khartoum, the capital of modern Sudan.
Arab historiographers (see Vantini 1975) often subsume the Nubian kingdoms
under Bilaad-an-Nuuba, land of the Nuba. Because the term Bilaad-an-Nuuba
also included the southernmost kingdom Alodia it was wrongly assumed in most
of the scholarly literature on Nubia that this had to be interpreted as an indicator
of a Nubian-speaking majority in the region. This interpretation is, however,
based on a lack of understanding of the function of this designation in Arab
sources. As late as the 6th century, the church history by John of Ephesus regards
the inhabitants of Alodia as “Ethiopians” and equates them with the people of
Meroe. The historian Jay Spaulding (1974:25) concludes: “While a Nubian com-
ponent may have existed, particularly north of the Nile confluence, it is almost
certainly misleading to incorporate Alodia into ‘medieval Nubia’ along with
Maris and Makuria.”
   This book concentrates on textual sources which originate north of Alodia, in
the alleged kingdoms of Nobatia and Makuria the regions of which are identical
to those stretches of the Nile Valley where Nubian languages were or are spoken.
Descriptions of the early history of these “empires” concentrated on two sub-
jects: The conversions of the royal dynasties to Christianity and the presumed
unification of the kingdoms and the date of this event respectively. The still valid
interpretation of the historical processes goes back to Ugo Monneret de Villard
who wrote his Storia della Nubia Cristiana in 1938. In the 6th century—the saga                                                                                 223
relates—, two independent Nubian kingdoms called Nobatia and Makuria ex-
isted in the northern Sudan. Nobatia’s history as an independent kingdom was a
short one. At the beginning of the 8» century, it was subsumed into the Makurian
state and Dongola became the capital of the united kingdom.
  These perceptions of presumed historical processes were influenced by two
factors. Firstly, eurocentric ideas about “nation” and “nation state” were applied
to the Nubian context. Secondly, the alleged political and early religious division
of Nubia was equated with the modern linguistic one. A critical assessment of
written sources was never undertaken. Postmodern practices of discourse analy-
sis were not applied to the pre-modern texts.
   Thus, the construction of two original medieval Nubian nation states which
consisted of two “nations”, the Nobiin in Nobatia and the Dongolese/Kenzi        in
Makuria emerged which has never been seriously questioned.
   The assumption of two independent Nubian kingdoms is tased on rather
scanty evidence in the early medieval Christian sources. There is neither evi-
dence from Nubia itself nor from Arab sources. As Arab sources undoubtedly
mention only one king of Nubia and only one capital and royal residence, Don-
gola, scholars developed the concept of the unification of the alieged two king-
doms with Nobatia as the inferior party. Based on an inscription from 710 found
in Tafa on Nobadian soil which mentions King Merkurios of Dongola, Monneret
des Villard (1938) dates the unification to the early 8h century. Merkurios who is
celebrated as the “New Constantine” in Coptic sources is also regarded as the
unifier of the two kingdoms by Vantini (1981:72). Kirwan (1982) pointed out the
questions brought about by this dating. When the new Arab rulers of Egypt tried
to extend their sphere of control to the south in 642, they advanced as far as
Makuria without meeting any resistance on Nobatian ground. During the second
attempt to conquer Nubia ten years later, the invaders were also led directly to
Dongola, and after negotiations with the Nubian king, the famous baqt-treaty
was signed which legally bound all Nubians “from Aswan to the border of Alo-
dia” (see Vantini 1975:640). As this formula excludes the possibility of two in-
dependent Nubian kingdoms at the time of the treaty Kirwan (ibid.), Crawford
(1951:23), Adams (1991:257), and others concluded that the unification took
place between 580, when John of Ephesus wrote his church history, and 642, the
year of the first Arab invasion.
    That the established interpretation raises some questions is obvious even to
those who represent it in their scholarly work. Adam (1991:257) wonders how
the unification could be carried out without any bloodshed. “This becomes re-
markable when we recall the warlike character of Nobadia two hundred years
earlier. The autocratic Nobadian chieftains buried at Ballana and Qustul, [...], do
not impress us as the sort who would meekly hand over sovereignty to a rival224
kingdom” (ibid.). Historian Jay Spaulding (1990:288) rightly discusses under
which circumstances Nobiin, the language of subjugated Nobatia, was able to
gain its status as official language of the united kingdom. Sudanese archaeologist
Ali Osman (cited in Spaulding, ibid.) gives the answer to these questions when
he remarks “that no satisfactory answer [...] will be forthcoming as long as
scholars continue to conceptualize medieval Nubia strictly in terms of the mod-
ern geographical limits of Nile Nubian speech”. The discussion above revealed
that the widely held belief that two independent kingdoms, each with a different
Nubian language, existed in Nubia is completely unfounded. No reference to the
alleged unification is found in the written pre-Arab sources; the assumption of
such an event was necessary to explain the political unity of Nubia documented
in the Arab source.
    With these interpretations and assumptions, the (re)construction of Nubian
history in the early medieval period had found its canonical form.","[222, 223, 224, 225]"

 background of these sources are necessary. A Christian author such as John of
 Ephesus who wrote in the 6th century did not visit the region but concentrated on
the compilation of an extensive ecclesiastical history based on different sources
which mostly remain unknown. This Christian discourse tells the story of the
triumph of a “superior” religion but also deals with the conflicts within Christen-
dom created by the council of Chalzedon. As he was an adherer of the Mono-
physite Church as opposed to the Orthodox faith, his writings reflect the dis-
course of a religious orientation which consistently had to compete with another
one and which suffered serious persecution at different times. John was inter-
ested in Nubia only insofar, as another story of proselytism to the “right” belief
could be told against this—from the perspective of Byzantium—“exotic” back-
ground. And his tale of the conversion of Nubia served to explain the mono-
physite character of the Nubian church as the triumphal result of a fight or com-
petition between Orthodoxy and Monophysitism.
   Of later, especially Muslim, writers hardly any had firsthand experience as trav-
elers in Nubia. Ibn Selim el-Aswani was a tenth century diplomat who was sent to
Nubia and left a written record of his travels. The original text, however, was lost,
and only excerpts of his account were preserved as quoted by the Egyptian histo-
rian and geographer el-Maqrizi who compiled his texts more than 400 years later.
Unfortunately, el-Maqrizi restricted his quotations from el-Aswani to the latter’s
geographical descriptions and left out most of the historical and political infor-
mation. Furthermore, el-Maqrizi was not particularly accurate in distinguishing
between el-Aswani’s and his own words.
   If we compare the different Arabic sources on Nubia we can observe that
some information circulated, some of it firsthand, but most of it second- or third-
hand. A lot of copying and compiling happened with regards to this compara-
tively remote region.
    As to the discourse of these texts, Hunwick (2005) speaks of “a region of the
mind” with regard to the Arab views on African geography and ethnography and
compares the modern “invention of Africa” by colonial administrators, travelers
and others to a similar “invention” by Arabs a thousand years earlier. Hunwick
(ibid., 108) distinguishes between different types of Arabic writers and mentions
those writers with geographical objectives, those who wanted to divide the world
known to the Muslim world according to regions. Some works were compiled as
handbooks for travelers. Furthermore, he identifies arm-chair encyclopedists and
historians. These different backgrounds determined the discourse of Arab writing
but there is also a dominant   Islamic discourse common      to more or less all of
these authors when dealing with Christian Nubia. The Nubians presented the
Christian “others” who for centuries resisted Arab conquest and compelled the
bilateral bagt-contract which obligated both sides to pay their human or material                                                                                 221
duties. Thus, it is not surprising that Arabic sources justify this situation by de-
picting the Nubian as fierce fighters (see below).
   If the Arab sources can be trusted most of the conflicts between Nubia and
Egypt which evolved in the course of the next centuries originated from the fail-
ure or unwillingness to fulfill the obligations of the treaty on the part of the Nu-
bians. As we have only one side of the story one dare say that this reflects a Mus-
lim discourse which tries to question the ability of an undefeated non-Muslim
neighbor to maintain a peaceful relationship and to legitimize any future attempt
at finally conquering people who were constructed as inferior.
   About the period between 1172 and 1268 nothing is documented about Nubia
in Arab sources. For almost a hundred years, Nubians and Arabs seem to have
enjoyed a peaceful neighborly existence despite the complaints mentioned above
(Adams 1977:508; Vantini 1981:124). When the Arab authors once again started
to write about the region they describe a country in turmoil. Again, we have to
ask for the political and religious background       which   determined   these texts.
Without going into detail it can be said that, although the situation seems to have
actually changed in the Nubian kingdom by the end of the 13th and beginning of
the 14th century, Arabic writing at that time most of all presents a legitimizing
discourse on the entitlement of Arabs to finally claim the Nubian throne not as
usurpers, but as legal heirs (see Vantini 1975; Adams 1975:12).
   For the sake of completeness, it has to be mentioned that non-Nubian Chris-
tian sources do not end with the conversion stories of John of Ephesus and oth-
ers. At a time when the Arab sources were silent, Abu Salih the Armenian who
was a Christian propagandist writing shortly before 1200 depicted Nubia as a
beautiful kingdom with wealthy churches. He seems to have had access to Arabic
sources because again much of his writing reads like a compilation from differ-
ent sources.
    Finally, we turn to the sources from Nubia itself. As has been mentioned be-
fore, the Arabic and also the Coptic texts from Nubia are for the most part not yet
published. Thus, our picture has to remain sketchy and the question as to the
different Nubian discourses cannot be answered yet. As most of what can be
classified as royal, economic, legal, and “emotional” discourses will be discussed
below, it shall be pointed out here that most of the Old Nobiin texts preserved are
of a religious and theological nature, including translations from the New Testa-
ment, liturgical texts and homilies. As religious texts were also composed in
Greek and Coptic this suggests a powerful Christian discourse dominating or
better constructing Nobiin identity for several centuries.","[220, 221, 222]"

 12. General Conclusions on Language Change in
      Nobiin
Although Modern Nobiin has much in common with its predecessor Old Nobiin
the language changed in significant ways in the course of about a millennium.
This does not come as a surprise, as language change is a permanent process not
least dependent on the social and political changes its speakers undergo in the
course of time. At all times, Nubia was a region where a multitude of languages
were spoken and written, a multi-lingual contact zone where different factors
influenced language use, language change, and also language shift.
   The creation of a written form of Old Nobiin, which was used in different
contexts such as church, political administration, economic transactions and the
personal sphere, is evidence of an highly organized political structure. It also
seems to have been one important means of constructing a Nobiin identity be-
cause at that time, the Nobiin already had two written languages, Greek and
Coptic, at their disposal. As on the one hand the oldest manuscript preserved
dates back to the end of the 8h century and written sources on the other hand
indicate that the Nobiin had been the dominant political force in Nubia from at
least the 6th century onwards, one has to ask for the reason why the Nobiin want-
ed a written form of their mother tongue at exactly that time. Written sources
from neither inside nor outside Nubia give an answer to that question. We can
only speculate that the period under consideration was a relatively peaceful one
which allowed for such a process. At the same time, the advancing Arab/Moslem
neighbors north of Nubia might have created an urgent necessity to construct and
assure a Nobiin identity. Political and religious changes finally led to the disap-
pearance of written Nobiin at the end of the 15th century. A Nobiin identity seems
to have no longer been sought after.
   The multi-lingual setting of medieval Nubia was the main factor in triggering
language change as it was described in this study. Between the 6th and the 13th cen-
tury Old Nobiin, as the language of the royal house, the administration, and also of
religion, was of high prestige which was certainly important to acquire knowl-
edge of for all those who spoke other languages as their mother tongue. First and
foremost, the speakers of Nubian Dongolese/Kenzi have to be mentioned here
                                                                                 217
which were settling in the Nubian Nile Valley as neighbors of and amongst the
Nobiin from the 4"") century onwards.
   It has been pointed out before (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996) that Modern Nobiin in a
way looks like a reduced or “simplified” version of its earlier stage. This devel-
opment can be explained by large numbers of people who spoke Old Nobiin as
second language but often had only imperfect knowledge of the language. Their
“mistakes” entered spoken Nobiin, a process which can to some extent be ob-
served in the documentary texts of Old Nobiin. This process probably intensified
when the language lost its status as quasi-official language.
   As has been shown, changes have been most prominent in verbal morphology
and morpho-syntax. The following features of Old Nobiin have been lost or are
only present in reduced or non-productive form:
 1. the subjunctive as morphological marker of a subordinate or complement
        clause
       . the predicative construction
AWN
       . the periphrastic constructions
       . the distinction between preterit I + II
       . the admirative
ONAN
       . the predicative copulative
       . the copulative constructions with -m(a), -me and -so
       . the emphatic particles -sin and -/o
 These constructions were not actually replaced in Modern Nobiin but formative
 possibilities were reduced especially where mere stylistic alternatives were em-
 ployed in Old Nobiin. The most important innovations in verbal morphology or
 morpho-syntax         were   based   on   verbal   complexes   which   gave   rise   to   new
 tense/aspect/mode forms. In some cases, the beginning of the process of gram-
 maticalization of independent verbs could be observed in Old Nobiin. New for-
 mations include the innovated future/intentional, the new habitual/imperfective,
 the durative/resultative, and the perfect(ive).
    Corresponding to these processes, main clauses in Modern Nobiin can no
 longer take either a predicative or indicative depending on the necessity to
 overtly mark person and number but take the one formation which remained.
 Likewise, the morphologically marked distinction between main and subordi-
 nate/complement clause was lost. This reduction also affected other construc-
 tions such as the conditional or the formation of relative clauses.
     It can be concluded that Old and Moder Nobiin are still closely related but
 that the modern variant is a result of language change through interference from
 non-Nobiin languages and their speakers.","[216, 217, 218]"

                                                                                        19
        It is beyond all questions that during the period which roughly corresponds to
     the European Middle Ages, Old Nobiin was the dominant language of the Chris-
EO
     tian Nubian kingdom with its capital at Dongola. Nubia was organized in a cen-
     tralized way that allowed language planning, the necessary prerequisite for the
     creation of a written and somehow standardized language. Nobiin was put into
     writing presumably sometime during the 8th century when political stabilization
                                                                                              ne
     had found its way in Nubia. Contrary to what earlier researchers assumed, No-
     biin was written in a modified form of the Greek alphabet and not of the Coptic
                                                                                              Stee POE
     one (Browne 2002:1!) which corresponds to the high status of Greek in Nubia
     described above. Several letters and the system of Old Nobiin supraliteration,
     however, were modelled on the Coptic alphabet and three letters were presuma-
     bly taken from Meroitic.®
           With the creation of its written form, Old Nobiin gained a sort of official sta-
      tus as the language of religious texts, of commercial activities as well as of the
      correspondence between government officials. One can safely assume that Old
      Nobiin was a language of high prestige which was important to learn for those
      who didn’t speak it as their mother tongue. Most of the texts preserved come
       from the 10th to the 12th centuries. This could be merely a question of not having
       discovered more documents from different periods. A more plausible explanation
       is a natural increase in the production of literary as well as documentary text in
       the course of the period under consideration. This process would parallel a similar
       one in Europe where literary production considerably increased in the 11 and
        12‘ centuries.? In Europe, however, this development had its peak in the
        13h century, when in Nubia the situation started to deteriorate.","[19, 20]"

A corresponding origin has to be assumed                       for the modern   equivalents. Thus,
-faala represents an assimilated and reduced form of far-/a ‘in/at the outside’.
faado goes back to far- ‘outside’ and the postposition -do ‘upon, at, to, for, over,
from, in, against’.
   To complete the picture additional postpositions have to be discussed. Into the
category of simple postpositions belong the two very similar ones
Old Nobiin
-(I-)logo, -(I-)loko                   ‘through, by, in’
-doko                                  ‘through, for the sake of, for’Browne (1996:49) raised the question whether the two must be regarded as mere
variants. -doko and -/oko appear in the same text in
(IT Il 28, 5-6 and 9-11)
oros-imme-kon              konk-il-loko
praise-ADM1SG-and          _relationship-through
 ‘and I praise you through (our) relationship’
 id-doko                   domm-a__uskr-eso
 you-for (the sake of)     take-ADJ  put away-IMPERSG ‘for the sake of you, take (him) and put (him) away’ If we take a look at the texts, we can observe that the two postpositions are not
 mere variants. -doko is only used with persons and follows e. g. personal pro-
 nouns, names or office holders, as in soyojin wiskit-il-doko (IT II 21.1.25-26)
 ‘through the deputy of the Sonoj’, id-doko (IT III 46.2, 58.1) ‘through you’,
 ma{Juda-doko (IT III 47.1) ‘through Maffuda’. -/ogo/-loko is mainly documented
 with abstracts, the name of the Lord, animals, things, anything inanimate, as in
 teuder-roko (IT II 15 i 13) ‘in the error’, ten senti-loko (IT II 16 vii 8-9) ‘through
 their prayer’, koir-roko ‘through the tree’ (ChN 19.17-18). We can conclude that
 Old Nobiin had two very similar postpositions, one with initial -d-, the other with
 initial -/- with similar meanings, one of which followed animate entities, the
 other inanimate ones. Interestingly however, all examples for -doko are found in
 the non-literary and non-religious texts of Qasr Ibrim II and III and the question
 raises how this phenomenon must be interpreted.
      Taking a look at Modern Nobiin we find that Werner (1987:129) proposes a
 similar distribution for the present-day variants:
 Modern Nobiin
 -log(o)                   ‘through, with’         instrumental/locational
 -dog,                     ‘with, at’              with persons
 46
In the Ermenne narrative, however, -dogo is not documented. Instead -/ogo is
used with persons in taf-faab-logo ‘to his father’ (AE 65), ay-gii-guu-logo ‘at his
uncles’ (AE 67), ai-logo ‘with me’ (AE 76). Lepsius (1880:42, 45) differentiates
between the two postpositions but admits that only one of his main informants
knew both, the other only used -/ogo. Hassan who came from the region between
Faras and Wadi Halfa knew -dogo as well as -logo, whereas Ali from Derr in the
north and Abel’s informant from Ermenne only knew the second one. We can
conclude that dialectal variation was and is involved here, but this doesn’t suffi-
ciently explain why and how -doko suddenly appears in the Old Nobiin texts. At
least two possibilities can be offered here. The two postpositions -/oko and -doko
were present in one or more dialects of the old language which became more
prominent at the time the text of Qasr Ibrim II and III were written. Alternatively,
-doko can be regarded as an innovation in the spoken language which the lan-
guage of the non-literary texts is closer to. The problem cannot exhaustively be
resolved on the basis of the available written evidence.
    Other postpositions which are present in the old and modern variants analyzed
here are
Old Nobiin                                             Modern Nobiin
-dan                    ‘with, occasionally against’   -(I)dal_   ‘with, at”The change from Old Nobiin -/ to Modern Nobiin -n is found elsewhere.

-(I)don                 ‘(down) from’                  -la-toon                ‘from, since”
                                                       -do-toon                ‘from’The change from Old Nobiin -d- to Modern Nobiin -f- is a common one. -(/)don
in Old Nobiin represents a rather peculiar case, because it is usually found with
the expression ‘(heavenly) Jerusalem’. In IT III] 35.16 we have one adverbial use
in a different context
(IT HII 35.16)
sag-asin         don-usk-il-lo
charge-COP       down-put-PARTPRES-EMPH
‘the charge that I put down’According to Werner (1987:135ff.), -toon regularly follows another postposition,
i.e. either -/a or -do, in Modern Nobiin. Only with a few local nouns like ‘the
north’ or ‘the south’, -toon is suffixed without an additional postposition. In his
list of words, Abel (1913:90ff.) only mentions -/(a)-toni. But in the narrative, we
find several examples for the compound siddo-toon ‘where from’ which consists
of the interrogative pronoun sid-do ‘where, where to, wherefrom’ and -toon.","[45, 46, 47]"
" The origins of the second paradigm in Modern Nobiin are difficult to determine.
 One explanation would relate the different endings to the Old Nobiin interroga-
 tive -ha which assimilated to the endings of the present or past. But this would
 be contradicted by the meager evidence where in one of the two instances -ha is
 suffixed to the question word and not to the verb. On the other hand, the use of
 -ha after the verb could have been generalized while at the same time its use  102
    after the interrogative pronoun could have been lost. At the moment, this expla-
    nation looks like the most plausible, although it cannot be proven.","[102, 103]"

ment of writing starting with the Egyptian occupation. Writing not only became a
cultural pattern but also some functional aspects of its use can be observed con-
tinuously throughout several millennia. Thus, writing in Nubia was an expression
of religious beliefs and a new religion often brought a new writing system.
   There are at least two interesting questions to be asked concerning literacy in
ancient Nubia. The first relates to the degree to which members of the Nubian
population could and did read and write. The second refers to the degree to
which the Nubians made use of writing and the purposes to which they put their
competence. Little can be said about the time of the Egyptian occupation other
than that literacy was restricted to a small group of scribes of northern origin.
Between 1000 and 750 BC, relationship between Nubia and Egypt deteriorated
and a new center of power emerged around the 4"" Nile Cataract. The new ruling
elite was literate from the outset and initially utilized the Egyptian language for
 official and religious purposes. The situation changed dramatically in the 3 cen-
 tury BC when the native Meroitic language gained official status and was put in-
 to writing. The new alphabet which was developed consisted of about 24 cha-
 racters and was based on Egyptian demotic signs. At the same time, Egyptian
 hieroglyphic forms were borrowed for another form of writing which was very
 rarely used. Millet (1974:50) has pointed out that the high proportion of errors in
 Meroitic hieroglyphic texts shows “that even literate persons were not normally
 very familiar with it”. The choice of a second script might have been a matter of
 positioning oneself in the tradition of the Egyptian empire and to retain the impe-
 rial cartouche. The demotic or cursive Meroitic script, however, was clearly in-
  tended for an every-day use “with pen and ink” (Millet, ibid.). Besides, for ex-
  ample, funeral stelae, inscribed offering-tablets, and a few historical inscriptions
  which are more official and often standardized, a great number of graffiti on
  temple walls and rock surfaces along major roads as well as ostraca documenting
  business or financial transactions have been found in even the smallest Meroitic
  villages. In addition, there are enough fragments of documents on papyrus and
  parchment to suggest a culture which appreciated books. With the decline of Me-
   roitic political power in the 4 century AD, written Meroitic disappeared. When
   Old Nubian became a written language, some of the characters seem to have
  directly been developed from Meroitic ones,’ so that at least a rudimental form of
  Meroitic writing must have survived for quite some time.","[15, 16]"

                                                                                   103
-sin is employed as emphasizer and copulative, the latter being the primary us-
age.
   -sin puts a whole verbal clause or verbal sentence into focus. Repetition of
   the particle within the clause or sentence is common but not obligatory.
   It also functions as focus marker in nominal sentences.                    ;
   With -appa ‘for’, the particle is obligatory and it may serve as a copulative
   with a preceding noun.
   -sin regularly has a causal implication, whether it is repeated      in the same
   sentence or not. The causal implication has to be inferred from context. The
   basic function remains that of a copulative.
   Suffixed to a noun in the predicative, -sin marks the antecedent of a relative
    clause.
The different functions of the so-called emphatic particles in Old Nobiin outlined
above might explain why so many sentences and clauses with -sin and even more
so with -/o are found in the texts and in the examples given in this study. In spite
 of these numerous examples from Old Nobiin, the two emphatic particles obvi-
 ously have disappeared in Modern Nobiin. The evidence is insufficient to finally
 decide on the matter but Khalil (1996) is the only one who cites in his dictionary
 of Modern Nobiin a suffix -sen with the presumed meaning of ‘yes, certainly,
 sure’ which presumably corresponds to ‘Old Nobiin’ -sin as the translation sug-
 gests an emphatic connotation.","[103, 104]"
"13.12 Letter-writing The documents most difficult to understand and interpret are the letters from
 Qasr Ibrim. This is partly due to their fragmentary condition, partly due to the
 informal character of the language used which often seems to reflect spoken
 language. This is exciting for a linguist who gets a glimpse of a linguistic varia-
tion which otherwise mostly remains unknown but frustrating for anyone con-
centrating on content. Because only one side of the correspondence is preserved,
understanding is additionally impeded. More often than not the question arises
what the writer wanted to communicate to the addressee.
    The letters fall into different categories, depending on their being more or less
official in character. The most difficult to understand is the personal correspon-
dence. Rather official are the letter to and from the eparchs which often refer to
disbursement of grain. Grain seems to have been stored either in central storage
facilities or in places belonging to the eparch.”¢ In spite of the official character
of these letters, they also show a personal touch which breathes life into the me-
dieval texts. Even though problems with economical transactions are addressed,
personal remarks reveal actual human beings speaking to us. “Come, in order
that I may show you affection. What is it? The king has ordered you. Why are
you reluctant to approach the task?”, an unidentified eparch writes to a man
called Maffuda. Another letter seems to have been dictated or written by a possi-
bly angry Eparch Adam (IT III 51). It reads unintentionally comical when Adam
writes: “Being reluctant to give (them) to her (agent) who was about to come, I
took the dates and gulped them down.”
    Amongst the letters preserved we also find documents originating from the
ecclesiastical administration as well as priestly correspondence. Concerning the
latter, Adams (1996:229) wonders about the reason why they were actually ar-
chived because “they do not appear to deal with matters of great consequence”.
This, however, we are not in the position to decide in retrospective. And if we
look at modern administrative practices of preserving every snippet of paper at
least for a certain period of time there is no reason to assume that the medieval23 The Arabic documents from Qasr Ibrim edited by Hinds and Sakkout in 1986 come from the
   Ottoman period.

religious interpretation, however, would assume that the marriages outlast the

   In the next example, it is more obvious that the action spoken about belongs
to the past and is concluded. The possessed man spoken about here is about to be

the present. Although there are only two examples with the preterit, a perfective
meaning is already indicated in these instances. In Modern Nobiin, verbal com-
plexes with kon-/kun-/ko- are restricted to the preterit. This restriction comes
along with a loss of the function of a perfect. The kon-/kun-/ko- complex func-
tions as a perfective in most of the examples above. That Werner failed to distin-
guish the formation from the preterit indicates a loss in functional differentiation
the endpoint of which was reached in the negative past where the complex with
kon-/kun-/ko- completely replaced the old preterit.","[174, 175, 176]"

administration acted differently. What has been said about the personal touch of
the eparchal correspondence also applies to the priestly letters. The priest Iesou,
for example, seems to express his unfortunate circumstances when he writes
(IT III 55): “In everything I am exposed. I call the king to my land. He is reluc-
tant. The one whom I sent will intervene: he loves me.” Different kinds of com-
plaints about personal misfortune seem to constitute part of the generally ac-
cepted public discourse in medieval Nubia.
    Unfortunately, the presumably most personal letters are mostly fragmentary
and might not all have been deliberately preserved. Interpersonal relationships,
emotional distress and support are dealt with in these documents. In a letter to a
woman addressed ‘daughter of Eitene’ (IT II 28), the female author seems rather
emotional and worried when she writes: “Except for you, I have had no one. You
I have held like mother and like sister and I praise (you) through (our) relationship.
You do not know what the son of Doue is like. May he not come and rain you.” In
another letter, translated by Browne with some question marks (IT {! 26), a man
named Basilios evidently tries to lend support to his distressed friend {srael,
domesticus of Faras: “[...] do not be dejected (?) for I shall go. Sit together (?)
and don’t lose (?) heart when I go. Sit together for I shall not sleep.”
    Summarizing it can be said that the letters of Qasr Ibrim represent an extraor-
dinary type of sources which allows us to get a picture of everyday communica-
tion and interpersonal relationships in medieval Nubia.","[243, 244]"
" As the conditional is discussed in detail in chapter 7, one example has to suffice
 here. We also find the new future/intentional where the English version of the
 bible has constructions with modal verbs, as in
 (GM 9,19)
 isonane-faaminii ai       ud-dan          _fa-aag-roo
 how long             I    you-with        1FUT-stay-] PLINTPRES-how
 isonane-faaminii ai       fa-saabri-rii                       ud-daani

 “How long shall I be with you? How long shail J put up with you?’This use is not surprising as many languages use this tense/aspect for similar
purposes. Also at the same time, this example consists of questions about the
future. A similar modal use is documented in the next example where fa- func-
tions as additional marker of a jussive:
(GM 1,38)
iig-a-tij-j-on                      irki        mool-kuu-I    fa-juur-oia

‘he said to them: “Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby’ 299All contexts in which fa- is used have in common that they express possibility,
that they are speculative and irrealis.
    This even more applies when in Modern Nobiin fa(-a) is combined with the
suffixes of the preterit. Lepsius (1880:98ff.) gives a paradigm for what he calls
Juturum exactum but admits that it is not found in his texts. He stresses that even
 in conditionals where he would have expected the construction, the present tense
is regularly used. Abel’s informants interpret the preterit fa-ju-s as ‘I will proba-
bly go (my going depends on the several circumstances)’. This is mentioned in
contrast to the use with the present fa-ju-r ‘I will go (certainly, I will definitely                                                                                                       161
go)’. Werner describes constructions where fa(-a) is used with the preterit as
irrealis, as in
(Werner 1987:151)
ay faa    oos-is
1          IFUT   take out-ISGPRET
‘I was about to take out (but couldn’t)’In Abel’s Ermenne texts, two examples of fa(-a) with the preterit which are not
morphologically marked as conditionals are documented:
(Erm. 32)
    irin     kab-j-an-ahara          faalal-latoni
your         eat-OBJ-INFGEN-after plate-from
    wide jeloow-oos-a         iboo-ga            faalal-la fa-uudi-ti-s
    then wash-DIR-ADJ         your-father-OB)    plate-on IFUT-put-INDOBJ-1SGPRET
    ‘after you eating from the plate I then cleaned it and put (the food) on the plate for your father’    This is a temporal clause with the subordinator -ahara ‘after’ followed by a ver-
    bal complex consisting of two verbs the first of which has adjunctive -a, the
    second is marked for tense/aspect. Abel interprets the sentence as a covert condi-
    tional which is not the whole explanation. In the narrative, several temporal
    clauses with -ahara are present, none is followed by the future intentional, e. g.
    (Erm 17)
    taf-fab-nani   auwok-ka eskalee-ltoni              kis-siin-ahara        iiga-tir-oon
    his-father-GEN night-OBJ water-wheel-from          come-INFPRET-after    said-BEN-3SGPRET     ‘after his father returned from the water-wheel at night, he said to him’     Accordingly, one would expect the simple preterit in sentence 32 above. The
     explanation for the use of the future intentional preterit seems to be that in this
     case it is constructed as an irrealis as opposed to all other occurrences of -ahara
     in the text. It is constructed in such a way because the proposition is wrong, the
     woman speaking is lying, the things she is talking about never happened. Thus,
     we have another example for the use of fa(a)- with the preterit functioning as
     irrealis.
        Abel’s explanation of an underlying conditional might apply for the next sen-
     tence which also presents a future intentional with the preterit.

circumcision-his-OBJ IFUT-make-BEN-ISGPRET    nice (white?)-ADV‘in order to carry out the run, I will carry out one to the south and the north and I will make his
circumcision beautifully’This is a final or purpose clause consisting of a verbal complex with two verbs
the first of which has adjunctive -a, the second is marked for tense/aspect. The
sentence contains a promise to God to be fulfilled after the birth of a son. The
condition this sentence refers to is uttered at the beginning of the paragraph
which the example above closes. The use of the past after fa- reveals that we are
dealing with an irrealis and as a matter of fact the promise the story talks about
could never have been fulfilled because of the speaker’s death.
    What has been called innovated future in the title of this chapter fulfills sev-
eral functions in the tense, aspect and modal system of Nobiin. The few exam-
ples from Old Nobiin which indicate something about the origin of the innova-
tion consist of religious predictions which seem to have the status of intentionals.
In Moder Nobiin, examples for the whole range of tense/aspect/modal marking
can be found. When there is a temporal specification fa- may function as future
tense marker. Without temporal reference, the element regularly marks an inten-
tional. In the translation of the gospel, prophecies              and predictions      are docu-
mented which correspond to those in the Old Nobiin texts. This leads over to the
frequent use of /a- in irrealis constructions which can also be observed with the
conditional. In addition, fa- is used in different kinds of constructions where
modal verbs are necessary in English. Finally, fa- is restricted to the function as
irrealis when used with the preterit.","[161, 162, 163]"

10.7 Durative/ResultativeThe Verb ak- is present in Old Nobiin with the meaning ‘to sit, to live, to stay’ as
the following example shows:
                                                                                                    167
(IT IH, 58,11)

formal texts with -ak- as second verb in a verbal complex:
(IT III, 36 ii 6)                                                                                .

write-1SGPRETII witness-1SGPRETII-focus
 ‘I, MafSuda, Deacon, who has       the   George-Church    of the West, sitting assembled with my Elders,
 wrote and witnessed it’ If we take the literal meaning of the verb, ‘sit(ting) assembiing’ has to be under-
 stood here. Whether a literal meaning is intended, as Browne (1991:53) indicates
 in his translation, has to be questioned. The context suggests that Maffuda is not
 actually sitting in assembly with someone at the time of the sale of land which
 the document certifies but that a continuing situation of Maffuda belonging to a
 circle of elders is implied.
     There are at least two other instances of -ak as second verb in a complex:
 (M. 1,9)
 tar-on        mir-a-ag-ende              ounn-ara          men-na-lo

"13.7 Administration and ClergyThe Qasr Ibrim texts contain an immense number of official titles from the po-
litical as well as the church administration. Adams (1996:246) poses the question
whether more than one hierarchy may be represented. There is, however, no
evidence to support this consideration. What the sheer number of titles shows is
that the medieval kingdom constructed itself as a highly organized and hierarchi-
cal entity matching the Byzantine Empire. Whether all of the titles refer to actual21 This is mentioned e. g. by Al-Hakam, (Vantini 1975:57), Al-Baladhuri speaks of “archers of the
      eyes” (ibid., 80)
234
 functions within the bureaucracy or some are only honorary ones, cannot be
decided.
    Many titles are from Old Nobiin, others are adopted from the Byzantine impe-
rial hierarchy. Adams (1996:246) has correctly pointed out that Byzantine titles
in Nubia do not necessarily implicate identical functions of the office holders.
Some of the Old Nobiin titles can be translated or at the least understood; most
elude translation and remain enigmatic. Some titles are always connected to
places whereas others are subordinated to superior offices like the eparch.
    Besides the king and the eparch discussed above and the queen mother dis-
 cussed below, an important office seems to have been the fuy- ‘Keeper of Grana-
 ries’, As many letters refer to the disbursement of grain (see below) from central
Storage facilities, this is not surprising.
     The Greek Architriclinus which can be translated as ‘steward, master of cere-
monies’ is rendered in Old Nobiin as odpo/ dauul. The literal meaning of this
title is ‘great thrower’. Unless this represents an unexpected Nobiin correspon-
dence to the “pupil-smiters” of Arab sources (see above and note 21) which is
highly improbable, the concept behind this title remains hidden to us.
     In several texts, the title dau(u)katt- is found. dau(u)- (or dau(i)-) is docu-
mented in Old Nobiin as ‘to be great’ and ‘path, way’. In Modern Nobiin, there is
a tonal difference between the two, dawwi ‘way’ with two high tones, and dawwi
‘great’ with   low-high   tones. As Old Nobiin    is not marked   for tone, it is in these
 cases difficult to decide which one is meant. Adams (1996:247) prefers a transla-
 tion as ‘great’ as does Browne who, however, also considers the alternative ‘way,
 path’. The second element -Xa/t- is known as an adjective formant but may also
 originate in similar noun formants, which does not help to decide on the origin. A
 look at the contexts in which the title is used does not significantly clarify the
 matter either. In one of the letters (IT II 24), daukatt- refers to the captain of a
 ship, in other texts (e. g. IT III 34), the title is associated with places, as in silmin
daukatt ‘daukatt of Ibrim’ or irkin daukatt ‘daukatt of the village’. It is tempting
to equate the latter use with the dawokati of the post-medieval Nobiin kingdom
of Kokka which Osman (1982:190) translates as ‘the elder wise man/head (of a
 lineage)’. But in the same way, one has to be careful not to confuse Byzantine
titles with the functions indicated by the titles in Nubia, it seems also problem-
atic to equate medieval Nubian titles with their post-medieval or modern equiva-
lents. One has to agree with Adams (1996:250ff.) who observes that in the me-
dieval texts no reference to the patriarchal extended family, typical for modern
Nubian society, or any patronymics can be found. This also holds for an entity
which could be translated as ‘lineage’. In the Old Nobiin texts, reference is made
to individuals who were property owners, economically active and who could
bequeath or inherit land to and from other individuals.","[234, 235]"

2.6 Old Nobiin Alphabet and PhonologyIt is not known how the speaker of Old Nobiin named the letters of their alphabet
and where the Meroitic signs were positioned. As Old Nobiin is only docu-
mented in its written form we can only approximate the phonetic value and pro-
nunciation of the signs. The following chart presents the letters of the alphabet
and their transcription in this book which corresponds to the presumed phonetic
value the signs represent:
     letter    transcription                 letter   transcription

       T             P
The letters presumably derived from Meroitic are F, P and 3.
   Besides its system of five vowels, Old Nobiin had several diphthong pho-
nemes which were /ai/, /aw/, /ew/, /iu/, and /oi/ which are still present in the mod-
ern variant. Old Nobiin occasionally marked vowel length in its orthography, but
there is no minimal pair with length as a distinctive feature. Furthermore, in
words which have a long vowel in Modern Nobiin vowel length alternates in the
Old Nobiin orthography, as in gar-/gaar- ‘shore, side’ or nog-/noog- ‘house’.
Vocalic alternations are a characteristic feature of Old and Modern Nobiin and
include frequent variation between a and e, e and i, o and i, and sometimes o and
u. Whether all of these are dialectal in origin as Werner (1987:46) and Browne
(2002:15) proposed is difficult to decide.
  Old and Modern Nobiin are rather similar with regard to their phonology, but
some interesting features and important changes have to be discussed here. If we
                                                                                   27
take a look at the distribution of nasals in Old Nobiin we find 7 restricted to
medial and final position, m and y to initial and medial position, and 2 to medial
position. In Modern Nobiin, the velar nasal is only word medial or final. In most
of the words with initial 7 we find 1 in present day Nobiin, as e. g. in
Old Nobiin         Modern Nobiin
nal-               nal-             ‘to see’
n0(0)k-            noog-            “house’In some words, however, initial g replaces the velar nasal:
nar-               gaar-             ‘to keep, hold’
nal-               ga(r)-            ‘son’
nol-               gol()-            ‘to gulp down’This discrepancy might be either due to dialectal variation within Nobiin or the
result of language contact.
    Zyhlarz (1928:9) was the first to discuss the phonetic nature of Old Nobiin A
which is supposed to represent and is normally transcribed as d. Already in Old
Nobiin, however, there are some examples of alternation between A and P /r/,
 e. g. in
ar-/ad-             ‘to seize’
oar-/oade-          ‘night’
~oro/-odo           ‘before’ It was therefore proposed that P originally might have represented some sort of
 retroflex sound. The situation in Modern Nobiin supports this hypothesis insofar,
 as we find alternating correspondences to Old Nobiin A in medial and final posi-
 tion (r is not found word initial). Although A is represented by d in most of the
 words, examples for corresponding r are documented in:
 Old Nobiin         Modern Nobiin
 nod                nor               ‘Lord’
 node               nore              ‘termite’
 tid-               tir-              ‘to encounter, meet’
 mid-               mir-              ‘run’ The most significant and obvious regular sound change in the system of conso-
 nant phonemes is the one of Old Nobiin p to Moder Nobiin fin word initial and
 final position, as in                                 ‘ Old Nobiin         Modern Nobiin
 pag-               fag-              ‘share’
 pal-               fal-              “to come out’
 park-              farki-            ‘valley depression’ 28
dapp-                daff-                “to perish’
dipp-                diffi-               “town, city’Although exceptions are documented, f doesn’t belong to the system of conso-
nant phonemes of Old Nobiin. In one of the Qasr Ibrim texts (IT II 16 iv 5), we
find a first instance of fi- ‘to be’ otherwise always documented as pi-.
    There are some exceptions to this otherwise regular sound change, e. g.
Old Nobiin           Modern Nobiin
ap(p)-               aab-                 “to grasp”
kap-                 kab-                 ‘to eat’In these instances, -p- was presumably not regarded as word final, because suf-
fixes had to be attached. In medial position, however, the regular correspondence
to Old Nobiin p is 5, as in
Old Nobiin           Modern Nobiin
ipol                 iboo                 ‘your father’
kumpu                kumbo                ‘egg’
torpar               torbar               ‘farmer’
tipit                tibit                ‘wave’To a certain extent, consonantal variation occurs which is probably due to dialec-
tal variation within Old Nobiin. These variations can be observed           between
voiced and voiceless consonants, as between g and k. In Old Nobiin, for exam-
ple, ak- and ag- ‘to sit’ alternate in the texts. This alternation is lost in Modern
Nobiin where only ag- is found.
    Ever since Herman Bell’s article from 1968 we know that Nobiin is a tone
language. Tone was, however, not marked in the orthography of Old Nobiin, and
we don’t know anything about its tonal structure and changes in tone from Old to
Modern Nobiin. Therefore, tone is not marked in any of the Nubian examples in
this book.
   Old Nobiin had a system of supraliteration with marks derived from Coptic.
Thus, a vowel forming a syllable is regularly marked by a horizontal stroke. If
the vowel is i, it bears diaeresis, e. g.
‘APOY     ‘rain’
ai        “|The vowel / is often not written, but marked by a horizontal stroke over the fol-
lowing consonant, occasionally the stroke implies the insertion of i before and
after the consonant, e. g.
TRA-      instead of TIAA-      “god”
CKT-      instead
              of ICKIT-       — ‘earth’
                                                                                  29
pert
       Finally, Old Nobiin also had its system of punctuation which also followed
       Greek practice. A raised point was regularly used to mark the end of a sentence,
       clause and colon. Other marks are sometimes employed to mark a question, the
       end of a section of text or a verse. In addition, most of the scribes left spaces be-
       tween words. For details of punctuation and supraliteration Browne (1981:55-61)
       should be consulted.","[26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

 13.6 Being Nubian/NobiinThe interpretation of historical sources has most notably been influenced by the
designations “‘Nubia” and “Nubian” as they were constructed by European schol-
ars in the late 19th and early 20 centuries. The implications of these construc-
tions and their different uses have been discussed elsewhere (Bechhaus-Gerst
 1996: 156-163) and will not be repeated here. The question to be discussed in
this chapter is whether or how a Nubian identity is constructed in the Old Nobiin
and non-Nubian texts.
    Starting with the direct evidence of the Old Nobiin texts, it has to be noted
that the term “Nubian” or “Nobiin”—we don’t really know how it was under-
stood in the medieval period—in the form nop- is documented in only one of the
Qasr Ibrim texts referring to a person. The single other instance speaks of a
camel called “Nubian”. Fortunately, the one instance of nop- designating a per-
son provides an insight into the construction of a Nubian identity. The text (IT III
33) concerns the release of a slave named Apa by his former owner Kapopi of
 Ibrim. Apa, as it is related by the text, does not plan to leave upon his manumis-
sion but is going to stay with Kapopi—presumably as a kind of wage worker.
The decisive passage says that Apa is going to be kept by Kapopi as a Nu-
bian/Nobiin. No further explanation is given, as the Nobiin certainly knew about
the implications of this declaration. Implicitly, however, this passage tells us that
a Nobiin/Nubian was a free person, i. e. a man or woman not enslaved. It is fur-
thermore evident of a Nubian/Nobiin identity which was not restricted to birth-
right and accordingly not constructed as fixed affiliation. A legal or declarative
process might have been necessary to become a Nubian/Nobiin, but nothing
definitive can be deduced from the scant evidence. In Nobiin, the term ofkir
‘slave language’ is documented as a designation for a language besides Nobiin
spoken in the kingdom which shows the construction of an unfree “other” within
the society dominated by speakers of Old Nobiin. Interestingly, this differentia-
tion is supported by Arab author al-Mas’udi who wrote in the first half of the
10"" century: “The Nuuba who are subjects of this king are divided into two
classes: a class whom we have described as free from all servitude, and a class of
subjects who are slaves” (Vantini 1975:135).
    The designation “Nubian/Nobiin” is not documented in any other Old Nobiin
text and further interpretation has to be deductive or discuss the perception or
construction of Nubian/Nobiin identity by non-Nubians.
    Although the “grand narrative” of the rise and triumph of Christianity in Nu-
bia is told in non-Nubian sources (see above) the documentary texts of Qasr
Ibrim present the Old Nobiin society as having been deeply anchored in the                                                                                 233
Christian belief. A standard introductory formula of contracts and letters invokes
the Lord or the Holy Trinity. The terms of the various contracts are underscored
by curses in the name of the aforementioned and the estrangement from God is
used as a menace against anyone trying to counteract a contract.
   Qasr Ibrim, of course, was a centre of religious activity in Medieval Nubia
and the documents mention as many as ten churches for Ibrim/Ibrim West and
additional ten for the vicinity of Ibrim (Adams 1996:252). Pilgrim’s graffiti also
attest to the importance of religiousness in the life of the Nubians visiting the
churches of Ibrim. Additional indirect evidence for the construction of Christian
identities is found in traditional Christian personal names found in the texts.
These      are, however,   much   less common    than Nobiin     names    or combinations      of
elements from the two backgrounds. The naming of children obviously did not
necessarily function as demonstration of Christian belief.
      It is not really surprising that we find quite different constructions of Nubian
identity if we look at the non-Nobiin texts.
      The Arab authors had to deal with and explain the fact that the Arab rulers of
Egypt unsuccessfully tried to conquer Nubia in 642 and 652 AD and had to sign
a treaty which warranted sovereignty to a non-Muslim kingdom. Thus, most au-
thors constructed the Nubians as a warlike people. They were described as excel-
lent archers by al-Mas’udi (Vantini 1975:132) and different authors reported that
the Nubians were nicknamed “‘the pupil-smiters” for their aiming accuracy.?!
      Contrary to the Arab texts, a warlike character is not described by the Chris-
tian authors. They wanted to stress that the Nubians welcomed their conversion
to Christianity (see below). Accordingly, Christian authors are much less inter-
ested in Nubian society and identity than Muslim ones but more or less restrict
themselves to the story of their conversion to the “right” belief.","[232, 233, 234]"
"                                                                                 157
   There is no corresponding form in Old Nobiin as the language had not yet de-
veloped verbal prefixes. Werner (1987:151) rightly rejects any attempt to explain
the element as loan from Arabic. Lepsius (1880:98) derives it from the independ-
ent verb fal- ‘to go out, to come out’, a plausible etymology, as future markers
often grammaticalize from motional verbs.
    It is difficult to trace the origin of the innovated future/intentional in Old No-
biin where the old one is still fully productive. Interestingly, it is in two of the
theological texts that we find clues to the genesis of the new future/intentional.
The two examples support Lepsius’ idea as to the origin of the future prefix fa-
which he developed without any knowledge of Old Nobiin.
(Lec. 100.4-6)

‘a word [Immanuel] which means “God will be with us”The verb pel- ‘to come out, to go out’ which has the alternative forms pil-/pal- is
the first element in a verbal complex which is marked as future. pel- is followed
by adjunctive -a. The literal meaning of the complex is something like ‘god with
us will come out become being’.
    The next example shows pil- as first verb in a periphrastic construction
marked as participle and followed by a predicative:
(ChN. 11.18-19)
armiskide-Ide        oukkout-ilde-kello         ekka   __ pel-j-il      :       pi-ra

sions can be drawn from only two examples. It seems highly plausible that the verb
pel-/pil-/pal- is the origin of the modern verbal prefix fa(a-). Obviously, the modem
construction is a relatively recent development in Nobiin which was not introduced
into the written language and might even be as late as the 15th or 16th centuries.
       In Modern Nobiin, constructions with fa(a)- as first element combine with the
suffixes of the present to produce the following examples:
(Wemer 1987:151)
tan-gii-n    as-ka                   fa-ed-i
his-uncle-GEN daughter-OB)           IFUT-marry-3SGPRES
‘he will marry his uncle’s daughter’
 158
    Corresponding to Werner’s interpretation as ingressive, the correct translation
    would rather be ‘he is about to marry his uncle’s daughter’.
       To detect any differences between the old and new future/intentional one has
    to look at the contexts provided by the longer texts. There are several examples
    of the gospel:
    (GM 1,8)
    ai uk-ka           gatis-ji-s                      aman       nogo   laakeen
    I you-PL-OB)       baptize-PLOBJ-ISGPRET           water     with    but    tar fa-kir           gatis-ji-n                 fogorti    gudsi-logo
    he IFUT-come         baptize-PL-3SGPRES         ghost      holy-with
    ‘I baptized you with water: but he will come (and) baptize you with the Holy Ghost.’    The sentence presents a typical biblical prophecy in which John the Baptist an-
    nounces the future arrival of Jesus. In Old Nobiin, the old future would have
    been found here, in the Modern Nobiin translation of the Gospel of St. Mark, the
    two constructions can be found side by side in certain contexts but the innovated
    future dominates where there is no direct connection with a verb of saying.
   Evidence for the verbal extension with /a(a)- as a late development in Nobiin
is the less close relationship between the element and the main verb. The next
examples show that different objects can be placed between the two:
(Werner 1987:151)
aboo      fa             shongir-k         __ide-e
my father IFUT           money-OB)         send-3SGPRES
“my father will send money’(GM 1,17)
ai     fa      uk-ka                ademi-rii-n   saiaada-ka-j-jir-eeni
I      IFUT    you-PL-OBJ           man-PL-GEN fisherman-OBJ-PLOBJ-make-for
‘and I will make you fishers of men’The question to be discussed here concerns the function of the fa(a)- prefix be-
tween tense and aspect, future and intentional. Lepsius (1880:97ff.) describes the
form as future but assumes that historically, there was a difference between the
old and the new future in that the old construction with suffixes marked a general
future and the new construction with prefix /a(a)- an intention and will to do
something. To his knowledge, this distinction had disappeared at the time of his
research and constructions with fa(a)- were in the process of completely substi-
tuting the old future. As mentioned above, Werner (1987:151) speaks of ingres-
sive with a second and—if at all—third function as intentional and future. He
interprets fa(a)- as expressing a strong certainty that an action or event is going
                                                                                           159
to take place. Thus, in the sentence aboo fa shongir-k ide-e ‘My father will send
money’, the speaker is quite certain that money will be send. Abel’s informants
(1913:13) give rather similar explanations when they translate fa-ju-r ‘I will go
(certainly, I will definitely go)’. According to Abel, fa(a)- functions as future
tense marker if an exact temporal specification is given, e. g.
Sahr-ee-n-ahara             irkuna      fa-ju-r
month-one-GEN-after         home        IFUT-go-ISGPRES
‘After one month I will go home (I definitely intend to go)’This example, however, is an isolated sentence and has no context. In Abel’s
Ermenne narration, the fa(a)- prefix is predominantly used in conditional claus-
es. But there are also some other contexts, e. g.:
(Erm. 56)
ai     Shatirhassan-ga gelaabiye afri-uwo-ga           fa-jan-ara-teer-[eye]        _hari-raton
I      Shatirhassan-oB) dress    Nnice-two-OB)         IFUT-buy-BEN-[she said}      silk-of
‘I will buy two nice silk dresses for Shatirhassan.’The speaker expresses an intention or wish to buy two dresses; she receives
money from her husband, goes to the market and actually buys the dresses.
   In the next sentence, the woman in the story is speaking to herself about her
intentions to kill her stepson. The chain of action as it is planned by her is ar-
ranged as a regular verbal complex consisting of three verbs two of which have
the adjunctive marker -a (aw-oos-a and uuda-ca-tir-a) and only the last one (fa-
di-keer-) takes the prefix fa- and the tense/person marker.

pan-one-into             Opposite-him     poison-OB)      put-PL-BEN     _IFUT-die-CAUSISGPRES-[she said]
 ‘The woman said to herself: “This night for dinner I will make eggs as food into a pan across from
 him I will put poison for him (and) I will kill him” (she said)’ As we learn only a few sentences later, she doesn’t succeed in killing him which
 gives the complex the connotation of an irrealis. But there are different reasons
 why the sentence is interesting to take a closer look at. We have a temporal ex-
 pression here (en-auwo ‘this night’) within a direct speech statement. The refer-
 ence point is the moment of the woman’s monologue in which she locates an
 action subsequent to the moment of speaking. This might be interpreted as a
 160
 future tense function of fa(a)-. At the same time, a strong intention or volition,
 i.e. to kill the boy, is expressed. Thus, we might speak of a future intentional
 with reference to the innovated future of Old Nobiin.
     It is interesting to look at different occurrences of the innovated future/inten-
 tional in Lepsius’ translation of the gospel. Regularly, it is used with the condi-
 tional, e. g. in

 served as independent verbs. Lepsius (1880) called tir- and -den ‘dative verbs’,
 because—amongst other things—they specify an indirect object in a verbal com-
 plex. Still, tir-/den- as second element are used in a verbal complex after the
 adjunctive -a which is, however, often missing. The following paradigm shows
 the modern endings which are contracted from -tir- plus present tense personal
 suffixes as listed by Werner (1987:186):
  IsG                 -teer/-teel                            IPL              -teer/-teel (Lepsius -teeru)

  144
 The change from Old to Modern Nobiin can been observed in the next example
 where jan-a tir- is used in a complex which conveyed the meaning of ‘to sell’ in
 Old Nobiin:                                                                                   |

 his-uncle good-PRED [he said]       dress     two-OBJ    buy-PL-ADJ-give-3SGPRET
 ‘his uncle: “it is good”- [he said], bought two dresses for him’ Here, directionality which characterized the Old Nobiin complex is irrelevant.
 Instead, the second object, a benefactive, is marked by fir-.              _.
     In the texts, it can be observed that some of the verbs, most notably iig- ‘to
 say’, are hardly ever used without tir-/den-. Examples are:
 (Erm. 131)
 [...] sultani   iig-a-tir-oon
 [...] sultan    say-ADJ-BEN-3SGPRET ‘[...] the sultan said to him’(GM 13,23)                                                       .

I  you-PLOBJ         jin advance   everything-OBS   say-ADJ-BEN-PL-1SGPRET
‘I have said to you everything in advance’iig- ‘to say’ has an underlying oblique argument. This must be marked at the verb
whether it is realized as a surface direct object, as it is in the second example, or
not realized, as in the first.
   In addition to iig- ‘to say’ Lepsius (1880:139) lists a few other verbs which
mostly take tir-/den-. These verbs are: wiidkire- ‘to answer’, gafre ‘to forgive’,
arre ‘to bring’, nadiife ‘to clean’, faai- ‘to write, prescribe’, iidir- ‘to send’, aaw-
‘to do’, and fedd- ‘to beg’. His examples come from the gospel of St. Mark, such as:

Similarly, examples from the Ermenne narrative illustrate the use and function of
tir-/den-, e. g.

 Summarizing it can be said that tir-/den- are documented in Old and Modern
 Nobiin as independent verbs with the meaning ‘to give someone (2""4/3""d person)’
 and ‘to give to me/us (1st person)’. The verbs are found in verbal complexes
 following the adjunctive -a which was occasionally missing at the older stage
and is more often omitted in present-day Nobiin. It did function and still func-
tions as an applicative. Underlying indirect or oblique object are marked by fir-/
den- regardless of whether they are realized as surface directs objects, surface
oblique objects or not realized on the surface at all. This construction can be
regarded as rather unchanged in the process of languages development from the
Medieval period to the present.","[144, 145, 146, 147]"

phrastic constructions constitutes a special case. In affirmative use, it was re-
placed by a verb men- ‘to be’. It looks exactly like the negative verb of Old No-
biin and its origin has to be discussed. That this is a random similarity seems to
be highly improbable. The complete paradigm for the present is listed by Lepsius
(1880:79):
Isc               men or min                               IPL              men-nu

(ibid., 117) gives the paradigm with final -7 assimilated to the negative verb:
IsG               im-mun                                   IPL              im-munu
2sG               im-minam                                 2PL              im-munokom

verbal complexes which was already present in Old Nobiin, but later completely
replaced the periphrastic constructions. If we take into consideration that one of
the functions of the participle and predicative periphrastic with -in and -men was
to topicalize the verb it is perfectly feasible that the topicalized negative verb
was reinterpreted as positive verb ‘to be’.
   In the next chapters, the four constructions which found their way into Mod-
ern Nobiin will be presented.","[120, 121]"
"13.3 The “Grand        Narrative” It is quite surprising from a methodological point of view that as late as 2002
 Derek A. Welsby in his book on the medieval kingdoms of Nubia interprets the
sources concerning the introduction of Christianity to Nubia as more or less
reflecting a historical reality. Although he captions his chapter on the conversion
of Nubia “the literary evidence” a critical discussion of sources let alone a thor-
ough discourse analysis is missing.
    Christian sources report that during the second half of the 6th century, Nobatia
was converted to Christianity by a delegation sent by Empress Theodora of Con-
stantinople with the sole purpose to evangelize the royal house. As Theodora was
a fervent follower of the monophysite faith which emerged as a result of the
council of Chalzedon in 451 AD, Nobatia also adopted the monophysite creed. A
second and rivaling dyophysite or orthodox delegation entrusted by Theodora’s
husband Emperor Justinian had to return unsuccessfully. The inhabitants of Ma-
kuria, however, were converted to orthodox faith under Emperor Justin II after
they had sent a delegation to Constantinople.
    The most prominent source is the church history written in 580 AD by John of
Ephesus in Syrian (Vantini 1975:6—23). John was a fervent adherer of the mono-
physite faith and gives an elaborate account of the conversion of the Nobades.
Included in his account is a narrative of the rivaling delegations. Kirwan (1982)
has convincingly shown that it is this aspect of John’s story which is not in ac-
cordance with the historical reality. According to his interpretation, only one                                                                                225
delegation was sent from Constantinople whose mission was more diplomatic
than missionary. Although John of Ephesus neither mentions the name of the
royal residence visited by the delegation nor gives any other concrete geographi-
cal specification the land of the Nobades or Nabados in his account was equated
with Nobatia by all authors. In connection with the subsequent conversion of the
inhabitants of Alodia, the alleged kingdom of Makuria is mentioned. One bishop
Longinus, sent to convert the Alodians, is prevented to reach his destination
directly by a people called Macuritae which settles in the region between the
Nobades and the Alodaei. Although the narrative has a fairy-tale quality when
John describes how God blinds the King of the Macuritae and his entourage to
prevent them from recognizing Longinus, the land of the Macuritae was equated
with Makuria. The hostile attitude of the Macuritae was seen as evidence of two
warring kingdoms in the Nile valley.
   The assumption of a conversion of Makuria to the dyophysite faith is based on
the Latin chronicle of John of Biclar (Vantini 1975:87). He gives an account of
delegations of people called Garamantes and Maccuritae visiting dyophysite
emperor Justin II in Constantinople. Although the subject of Christian conversion
is only mentioned in relationship with the Garamantes scholarly literature readily
assumed that a similar concern was leading the delegation of the so-called
Macurritae.
   Kirwan (1982:143) was the first to dismiss Monneret de Villard’s (1938:66)
version of a dyophysite conversion of Makuria. His argumentation centers on the
question whether the Maccuritae actually are the people of Makuria which he
denies.
   More important, however, is that a majority of modern historians agree upon
the close relationship between Theodora and her husband Justinian which makes
the sending of rival delegations highly improbable. Justinian apparently appreci-
ated having a wife “whom the Monophysites considered accessible” (Evans
2003:72). The story of the delegations might well be a complete fabrication by
the authors influenced by religious fervor and the will to promote their creed.
   The reconstruction of the religious history of the Nubians closes with the
claim that in return for the loss of sovereignty of Nobatia, Makuria also adopted
the monophysite faith and solved the problem of the two different religious con-
fessions within one empire (Adams 1991:258). Again, this supposition is not
based on any written or non-written evidence but has to be regarded as last-ditch
attempt to deal with the different sources which do not add up, if taken as evi-
dence of historical reality. One has to wonder why Adams supports traditional
interpretations when at the same he writes: “There is not, I hasten to add, a scrap
of positive evidence to support this conjecture; indeed there is no evidence at all
in regard to the unification either of the kingdoms or of the churches” (ibid.).","[225, 226]"
" Browne (ibid.) hypothesizes that -a is a reduced form of ia- ‘saying’ which con-
 sists of the verb -i plus adjunctive -a.
    -a does not only function as marker of direct speech, but also as complemen-
 tizer in Old Nobiin. That Browne’s hypothesis on the origin of -a is correct, is
shown below, where the non-reduced and the reduced forms are found as com-
plementizers in similar contexts. In these examples they are used with the verb
ank- ‘to think’:

was described as second stage of the grammaticalization process above. The next
examples show the marker of direct speech/complementizer as marker of reason/
purpose clauses:
(Lec. 109.1)
Osi-j-e-a-ion                                seni-min-ne-so

This sentence from the Lectionary is interesting in that -a and conjunction -ion
follow the imperative, resulting in a complex suffix -eaion. The connection with
the imperative as well as with the verb ik- (ek-) ‘to say’ is found in the following
examples from the documentary Qasr Ibrim text:
(IT II] 48.7-8)
ai-roko-lo            magak-ka_       _oss-e-a                     ek-eso

‘tell in order that it be taken out to Magal through me’ (lit.: tell: ‘take out to Magal through me’)Without a following conjunction the suffix imperative singular -e and marker of
direct speech/complementizer -a result in the compound suffix -ea.
   Other examples of purpose clauses are:
(Lec. 112.10)

 clauses are expressed by the infinitive and the verb i- + adjunctive -a. The result-
 ing compound suffix -ia is often reduced to -a which functions as marker of
 direct speech.
     Wanting to summarize what has been discussed above we have to turn to the
 different forms as well as to the various functions and the possible relationship of
 the two.
    In Old Nobiin, a verb il- ‘to say’ is found which is often reduced to i-. It has
 various forms and functions depending on the contexts and the following end-
 ings. The forms and function can be listed as follows:
 96
 Form                                         Function
 i(l)-                                        reinforces another verb of speaking
 i- + -a adjunctive reduced to -a-            marker of direct speech
 i- + -a adjunctive or reduced -a             complementizer
 imperative + -ia or reduced -a               purpose clauseThe combination of the various additional endings needed to express the differ-
ent functions produces a wide range of compound suffixes, as e. g.
reduced -a                                            -a
i- + -a adjunctive                                    -ia
-ia + -ion conjunction ‘and’                          -iaion
imperative -e + reduced -a                            “a
imperative -e + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a           -esoa, -esa
imperative -e + reduced -a + -ion conjunction         -eaion
imperative -ana + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a         -anasoSome of these endings are obviously related to those listed by Lepsius (1880) for
Modern Nobiin under the different headings “imperative”, “conjunctions” and
“purpose clause”. On the way from Old to Modern Nobiin the imperative/jussive
dropped optional emphatic -so. Imperative markers -e and -ana are still present
from Old Nobiin. To these Lepsius (1880:139ff.) adds other endings which are
now well known from Old Nobiin. If we isolate these endings, we find:
SG        -ee the long vowel presumably going back to imperative -e + -a
          -ia(a)
PL        “a
          -ia(a)According to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) for the 3"" person jussive occasionally -ion
for the singular and plural is added to the 24 person endings, resulting in suffixes
38G       -eion
3PL       -anaionWhat we find here are not new endings for the imperative but the markers of
direct speech/complementizer of Old Nobiin. Either Lepsius misinterpreted these
endings due to the fact that all his examples for imperatives necessarily consisted
of either direct speech or complement clauses/indirect speech or we are dealing
with a reanalysis of Old Nobiin purpose clause as simple imperatives.
   Lepsius and Abel note that in the texts the different forms of the ending inter-
change arbitrarily. These variations consist of:
Form
Lepsius      -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion
Abel         -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye
Wemer     = -aya/-yon/-ayon/-eyon                                                                                    97
The endings given by Lepsius and Werner are similar, because they both include
at least some forms which add -ion/-yon. Werner (1987:342) lists -aya as non-
personal form meaning ‘saying’. The three other suffixes are translated as ‘he
said’, thus being interpreted by him as 3'4 person singular preterit which, how-
ever, has lost final -n according to his own paradigm. From the many examples
in the texts it seems much more probable that these endings go back to Old No-
biin forms with conjunction -ion ‘and’ (see above).
      All in all a table with the different forms and function of the verb-turned com-
plementizer in Modern Nobiin shows many similarities in function, but no longer
clear-cut divisions between the forms:
Form                                                 Function
-ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion                                 reinforces another verb of speaking
-eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye           }                  marker of direct speech
-aya/-yon/-ayon/-eyon                                complementizer
 future infinitive + -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion            purpose clause
                     -ecye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye   }
mas- ‘good’ + -ceye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye                discourse markerIt seems that in the process of becoming Modern Nobiin several morphosyntactic
and functional processes took place. Compounding and cliticization occurred in
Old Nobiin when the reduced verb i- and adjunctive -a were combined to func-
tion as marker of direct speech and complementizer. The verb i- ‘to say’ was
desemanticized to become a complementizer. In Old Nobiin, different assimila-
tion processes were involved depending on the preceding words or phrases. The
resulting phonologically determined variations were obviously reanalyzed as free
alternatives, morpheme boundaries disappeared. The optional connection of the
endings with conjunction -ion ‘and’ was also included in the various processes
and a merger took place with the preceding verb-tumned complementizer. It also
was completely desemanticized. Although the use of the different ending is arbi-
trary today, Old and Modern Nobiin are still rather similar with regard to the
form and function of the elements described above. The most striking difference
concerns the use with purpose clauses. The various endings are still used to ex-
 press purpose, but have to follow the Old Future.","[95, 96, 97, 98]"
"
Excurse 2: The Origin of a Complementizer in NobiinAccording to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) the endings -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion are often
attached to the positive and negative imperative. He interprets these suffixes as
alternative and arbitrary forms of a subordinating conjunction. Their use with the
imperative/jussive, he continues, is determined by the conception of these con-
structions as dependent or subordinate. They can be suffixed to any verbal end-
ing without changing its meaning and function. Lepsius distinguishes these end-
ings from identical suffixes he calls shortened and enclitic forms of the verb iig-
‘to say’ which he describes as used parenthetically in narratives corresponding to
Latin inquam, inquit ‘I said, he said’ (Lepsius 1880:330). Abel (1913:15ff.) has
shown that the two are identical. In his Ermenne narrative these endings are
found as -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye and documented about one hundred times within
two hundred sentences. Werner (1987:383) mentions the variants -yon/-ayon/
-eyon in his wordlist. He calls the forms “‘subordinating morphemes”, but doesn’t
discuss their function in his grammar. Although Werner speaks of “subordinating
morpheme”, he adds the translation ‘he said’ to the three variants.
   Lepsius, Werner and Abel agree that the endings originate in the verb iig-,
shortened i- ‘to say’ and that the different forms have to be regarded as clitics.
Looking at Old Nobiin we find evidence that originally two verbs with the mean-
 ing of ‘to say’, igir-/ig- and il(d)- were present. Only il(d)- was occasionally
 reduced to i-. The endings therefore can be traced back to the latter and do not
 originate in igir-/ig- which is still present as independent verb in Modern Nobiin.
    The process which the commentaries of the different authors indicate resem-
 bles the one described e. g. by Lord (1976) for West African Kwa languages
 where the verb ‘to say’ is reinterpreted as a subordinator, which was probably
 first used with complement clauses and was later extended to other clause types.
 According to Lord the process begins when a general verb meaning ‘to say’ is
 90
used to reinforce other verbs of saying in the so-called matrix clause. This is the
case in most of the examples from the Ermenne narrative which have the general
verb jig- ‘to say’ reinforced by -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye, as in
(Erm. 20)

‘he said to them: “I want a contract with you” [-he said], [...], they said: “but what is your contract”
(-they said)’In the sentences of the Nubian textbook Werner based his grammar on, this con-
struction is found in connection with direct speech in almost the same way as in
the Ermenne text:
(Wermer 1987:306, 40.11-12)
kaj       murti-g             iiga-tir-o               in            kirri_   gittir-aya
donkey    horse-OBJ           say-BEN-3SGPRET          this          load     heavy-[he said]‘the donkey said to the horse this load is heavy [he said]’In the dialogue between the donkey and the horse following the introductory
sentence above, each statement is completed by -ayon or -eyon. It can be con-
cluded that the endings not only reinforce the verb ‘to say’, but generally mark
direct speech, although they are not obligatory.
    In the next examples the notion of direct speech is lost and the endings func-
tion as complementizers:
(GM 9,11)
iig-innan           eeliiaa     fa-ki-in-iaa
Say-3PLPRES         Elias       1FUT-come-3SGPRES-COMP‘they say that Elias will come’At the same time the endings come to be used as complementizers after a whole
range of matrix verbs which include verbs of cognition and perception, but most
of all with different verbs of speaking.","[90, 91]"
"  In the Miracle of St. Menas, the woman referred to above is barren. The sentence
  describes a continuing situation which later is changed only by a miracle. It is
  beyond all question that -ag is not used in its literal meaning, but what literally
  renders ‘sit being barren’ is some sort of durative with -ag as its marker. The next
  example also comes from a religious text:
  (Chrys. 23,16-18)
  ok-ka          tous-esin-de        aei-l      koskit-ka meci-ak-o-na
  chest-OBJ      curse-3SGPRETII-and heart-SUB) evil-OBJ | desire-CONT-PART-GEN
  tar-ia dar-esin-no-joalo
  it-in be-3SGPRETII-through, because of  ‘if he cursed the chest, it is because there existed in it a heart which was desiring evil.’   168
The general context of the sentence is that of God condemning Adam and Eve
and banishing them from paradise. God curses Adam (‘on your chest [...] you
will crawl [...]’) and the curse is explained by the evil desired by the heart within
that chest. Undoubtedly, we once again find the Old Nobiin -ak- complex denot-
ing an ongoing situation.
   Unfortunately, Old Nobiin doesn’t offer many instances of such a complex.
Although it is documented in the more formal religious or theological texts it is
hardly ever used. It can, however, be observed, that -ak-/-a(a)g- was occasionally
used as second verb in a complex where it expressed duration. We have to turn to
Modern Nobiin to track its development.
   In Modern Nobiin, the verb is found as -aag which is still used as a suffix in
verbal complexes.           It can, however, no longer stand alone, but always follows
-e(e)d (see chapter 10.4). Thus, we have a compound suffix -edaag-. Werner
(1987:184ff.) identifies the complex as durative which according to his analysis
is mostly used with the present. This interpretation would agree with the Old
Nobiin evidence. Again, it is worthwhile to look at the texts. The first example
comes from Abel’s Ermenne narrative:
(Erm. 27)
medidi      _faalal-la-da-fii-ka        kaba-tamm-eeye         diidee-l-daa-fi-ka   kab-eeye

‘do not eat the porridge being on the plate [she said), eat [she said] the one being in the pot because
your father’s wife has put for you poison on the plate’Abel gives a lengthy explanation of the meaning and function of -e(e)d-aag-. H¢
correctly remarks that udr-eed-aag-in has the literal meaning of ‘he gives (and!
sits’. From there it obtained the function to refer to an action the result of which
continues into the present or the moment of the narrative. His example is:
(Erm. 69)
ai-ik-ka   gelaabiye uwoo-ga         jaan-adaag-a-te-ri
I-you-oB) dress      two-OB)         buy-DUR-ADJ-OBJ-ISGPRES
‘Lhave bought two dresses for you’The literal meaning of the sentence is given by Abel as ‘I buying you two dresses
sit there’ = ‘I’ve bought two dresses for you and have them here’. Accordingly,

     Lepsius doesn’t recognize -edaag- as separate formation                                 at all, but in the
translation of the gospel of Mark some examples are found:
(GM      1,16)

complex has the suffixes of the preterit like all other verbs.
 (GM 12.1)

 tower, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey’
 Interestingly, only one of the verbs above has -edaag- whereas four of them have
 -oos. These presumably have to be interpreted as resultatives in contrast to the
 complex with -edaag which has a durative connotation.
     Werner (1987:185) describes the verbal complex with -ed-aag- as denoting
 duration of an action. Although its meaning and function is supposed to be simi-
 lar to the -fii- stative (see chapter 10.9) he regards the -edaag- complex as having
 a more durative meaning. In his data, it usually takes the suffixes of the present,
 but occasionally—though not documented in his paradigms—also those of the
  past.
     Reinisch (1879:56) categorizes -edaag- amongst his basic forms which has to
  be rejected. He interprets the construction as meaning ‘doing something for quite
  some time’.","[168, 169, 170]"

                          The initial vowel as well as -r- may be dropped. The predicative preterit II would
                          have been -isira, but is not documented. There is a preterit II form -isa which is
                          only used in attributive constructions (Browne 2002:50).
                                 Besides the indicative, the predicative can occur in a verbal sentence. As per-
                          son and number are not marked with predicative forms, it can only be used if the
                          subject is expressed or understood within the context. Examples are innumerable
                          in the religious as well as documentary texts. Some of them are presented below:                          Predicative Present

EEEEEEeEeEeEaEEeEVw~Es~
                          In Modern Nobiin, some remnants of the formerly widespread predicative -a are
                          found. In a nominal sentence, the noun which functions as predicate is still
                          marked by -a, but it is followed by men- ‘to be’ marked for tense/aspect and
                                                                                                                                        69

person. This construction corresponds to the one from Old Nobiin mentioned
above under 3. ‘nominal predicate + in- ‘to be”. Only in the 3""4 person singular,
the verb can optionally be dropped (Werner 1987:203). The resulting construc-
tions resemble to the nominal sentence of Old Nobiin:
(Wemer 1987:203)

this      man-PRED
‘this is a man’ (ibid.)In Abel’s Ermenne narrative and the gospel according to Mark, we find examples
of the construction with men-:
(Erm. 26)

 ‘the horse knew everything through a gift of god’ tirt-a-men—with assimilation to the following —sin—has the literal meaning of
 ‘being a gift’.

 the 3d person singular, as the following example shows:

 you  god-GEN            son-PRED
 ‘you are the son of god’

The predicative as one of the verbal forms in a verbal sentence has completely
disappeared. In connection with verbs, only the adjunctival function of -a was
preserved. In this function, it is still found in verb strings or verbal complexes
where it is suffixed to all but the last verb which takes the tense/aspect and per-
son markers,Excurse 1: Indicative and SubjunctiveIt has been mentioned before that Old Nobiin had indicative as well as sub-
junctive forms. Indicative and subjunctive are rather traditional labels which
might no longer be generally understood in the sense they were used within the
framework of Old Nobiin grammar. Therefore, some explanations seem neces-
sary, as—to hopefully simplify matters—this distinction is maintained in this
book. As presumably generally known, indicative and subjunctive belong to the
grammatical    category of mood.    Palmer (2006?:5) discusses the difference be-
tween indicative/subjunctive on the one hand and realis/irrrealis on the other
hand. Although both may express the distinction between the notional features of
realis and irrrealis, there are differences in their distribution and syntactic func-
tion. A characteristic feature of the subjunctive is that it is found mainly in sub-
ordinate clauses. Palmer furthermore mentions that the indicative/subjunctive
system usually occurs with the tense systems, a feature which does not apply to
the realis/irrealis system. He discusses a wide range of different subordinate o
complement clauses which are marked by the subjunctive in various language:
of the world (ibid., 107-144). Most of his categories have, however, no relevance
for the use of the subjunctive in Old Nobiin.
   Jespersen (1924:314) noted that the subjunctive may simply have the function
of being subordinate and therefore is typically the mood used in subordinate
clauses. Palmer (ibid., 142ff.) agrees with Jespersen’s assumptions and stresses
that the subjunctive sometimes lacks any motivation of irrealis. He gives exam-
ples from Latin where the use of the subjunctive increasingly concentrated on
marking subordination in general or to distinguish between different kinds of
subordinate clauses.
    With regard to Old Nobiin, the first grammar by Zyhlarz (1928:59) distin-
guished   between   an   emphatic/finite   and   a subjunctive/infinite   conjunction.
Browne (1982 and more) replaces emphatic with indicative but otherwise agrees
with Zyhlarz’ general interpretation of the verbal system. Both authors regard the
subjunctive as one of the forms of the verb in subordinate clauses, the other one
being the participle. Browne’s thorough analyses has shown that both forms are                                                                                    71
verbal nouns distinguished by the overt expression of person and number in the
subjunctive which       is missing with the participle. Although     in some        instances
irrealis features might be involved, they are by no means predominant or even
important. First and foremost, the subjunctive in Old Nobiin is a subordinator
used in all kinds of complement clauses without any notion of irrealis, the main
factor being the necessity to express person and number.                       .
   Correspondingly, the term indicative refers to the form of the verb in main
clauses if person and number have to be expressed. Otherwise, parallel to the
participle in complement clauses, the predicative is used in main clauses.
   All authors writing on Modern Nobiin also dealt with the question of the exis-
tence of a subjunctive in the language. Lepsius and Reinisch who had no knowl-
edge of Old Nobiin came to different conclusions. Reinisch (1879:82) lists a
paradigm for the subjunctive in Modern Nobiin which mainly differs from the
indicative in the absence of the innovated second person singular and plural (see
below chapter 6.1). There are, however, no convincing examples in his texts.
Lepsius obviously wasn’t aware of a subjunctive in Nobiin and ignores it com-
pletely. In his comment on Reinisch’s grammar (1880:477) he points to the fact
that no examples are given and that his informants are ignorant of the forms.
Eighty years later, Abel (1921:3) describes the old subjunctive of Nobiin as about
to disappear. Another sixty years later, Werner (1987:192) recorded the remains
of a subjunctive paradigm which only shows up when followed by the postposi-
 tion -faan ‘until’. It is no longer productive and the comparison with Abel’s
 paradigm reveals that in the 2nd and 3% person singular, the personal endings
 were either lost and replaced by the suffix of the Infinitive -e, as Werner (ibid.)
 suggests, or simply reduced from -en to -e. Neither in the singular nor in the
 plural, the innovated suffixes of the 2.4 person are found.

 2PL           tog-ru                    doll-ilu(faan)            kab-luu(faan)
 3PL           tog-inan                  doll-inna(faan)           kab-inna(faan) /r/ and /V are free variants in connection with personal endings. The problem
 with Abel’s paradigm of the subjunctive is that it looks like the indicative minus
 the innovated 2""4 persons. That there actually are remnants of the old subjunctive
 in Modern Nobiin is most obvious in Wemer’s 1st person singular and 1st and
 2d person plural where even the ambiguous forms of the Old Nobiin subjunctive
 are preserved. If the attempt at reconstructing the innovated personal endings is
 72
at least partly correct (see below) it is consistent that they are missing in the
subjunctive. The indicative copulative -m(a) never follows a verb in the subjunc-
tive in Old Nobiin (see chapter 9.5). A much simpler explanation would argue
with the status of the subjunctive as disappearing as a productive paradigm at the
time of the innovation of the 2     person ending which was only preserved      in
fixed paradigms like the so-called ‘subjunctive with -faan’.
   To summarize these excursive remarks it can be emphasized that the terms in-
dicative/subjunctive are maintained in this book basically referring to morpho-
logically distinct verb forms in Old Nobiin found in main and subordinate/com-
plement clauses. How these combine with various tense/aspect constructions will
be discussed in the respective chapters. In Modern Nobiin, the morphologically
marked distinction is lost, but looking at the endings (see below) it is far from
obvious whether these represent reduced endings of the old indicative or whether
the old subjunctive was generalized and also used instead of the original forms.
Definitely, predicative -a, which was characteristic of Old Nobiin indicative, is
missing in Modern Nobiin.","[68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73]"

others and is difficult to explain. It is interesting to note that the endings based on                                     ;
-ko- which were predominant in Old Nobiin have completely disappeared. From
the plural endings, it can be deduced that the construction with -/o formed the
basis of the modern forms. In Werner’s paradigm, forms are even more reduced.

either the imperative or the so-called innovated future/intentional (see below
chapter 10.5). It has been mentioned above that Old Nobiin had an optional addi-
tional marker which introduced a conditional clause, alesin ‘truly’. In Modern
Nobiin, is has been replaced by the optional particle -on/-lon ‘if? suffixed to the
subject of the protasis, so that a double marking is still possible.
   In Modern Nobiin, the endings of the conditional can also follow the perfect
with -ko/-kun. In the Ermenne narrative, we find the following example:
 (Erm 4)

 Shatirhassan-OBJ           _IFUT-call-1SGPRET-[...] ‘if | become pregnant and deliver a son, I will call him Shatirhassan [...]’ The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘if | have become pregnant and have deliv-
 ered a son, I will have called him Shatirhassan’. The function of these construc-
 tions with the past can be deduced discussing the following dialogue between
  Shatirhassan and his father. The two sentences are consecutive in the text.

   ‘his father said to him: “o my son, if I marry this woman she will become a stepmother for you””   Abel (1913:13ff.) gives a rather convincing explanation of the difference in
   meaning between the two constructions. The present and future are used in the
   father’s answer because it is certain that the woman will become the boy’s step-
   108
mother as an outcome of the marriage. That the two will be better off after the
marriage, as the boy suggests, is, however, far from certain. Thus, according to
Abel, the past is used. What Abel describes is the difference between a real con-
dition and an irrealis. The father’s statement presents a real condition, because a
certainty is expressed, the event is taking place. By contrast, the son’s prediction
consists of an irrealis. As the development of the story shows, the situation of the
son deteriorates, because his stepmother tries to kill him. In the light of this de-
velopment, some of the promises made by his father’s new wife are unreal in that
they are blatant lies. They are therefore marked as irrealis, as in
(Erm 16)

IFUT-serve-ISGPRET      you-and      IFUT-love-1SGPRET
‘if your father marries me, I will serve you better than this and | will love you’The examples show that in Modern Nobiin real and unreal conditions can be
expressed and morphologically distinguished. Real conditions are characterized
by the endings of the conditional in the protasis and the endings of imperative or
innovated future which takes the suffixes of the present in the apodosis. In the
irrealis, the endings of the conditional follow the perfect marker in the protasis,
and in the apodosis, the innovated future is followed by the suffixes of the pret-
erit resulting in a future preterit. The first construction resembles those of real
conditions in Old Nobiin presented above. Whether the irrealis was expressed
accordingly in the old stage of the language has so far been left open. It seems
that there are only three instances of an irrealis documented in the texts. One of
these examples comes from Qasr Ibrim:
(IT 17 ii 15-16)
i-san-en-appa                 nodu    nok-in-ka     istauros-ildo _ ollir-imen-di-sana-sin
know-3PLPRETIISUB-?-for       Lord    glory-GEN-OBJ cross-upon —_ hang-NEG-FUT-3PLPRETII-EMPH
“for if they had known, they would not have hanged upon the cross the Lord of Glory’The apodosis has the endings of the old future followed by the suffixes of the
preterit II indicative, comparable to the construction in Modern Nobiin presented
above. The protasis differs in that the verb is preterit I] subjunctive which is in
accordance with its status as subordinate clause marked by -appa ‘for’. This
might be due to the fact that contrary to the examples of Modern Nobiin where
the events and actions described are in the future at the time of speaking and still
an—if unlikely—possibility, the event described in the Old Nobiin example is no
longer possible because at the time of speaking, a different course of action has
                                                                                                109
already been taken. In Old Nobiin, an additional element -en is inserted which
seems to be documented in only one other non-restorated instance:
(IT 1412-3)
iri    inno duar[a?)en-kan an         ennal          di-me-dra-lo
you    here   be-PRED-?-3SGCOND       my brother     die-NEG-FUT-PRED-EMPH
‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died (lit.: ‘will not die’)This example has the 3% person conditional -kan in the position of -appa in the
example before. Although the past is not morphologically marked, the sentence
is an irrealis in the same way as has been found before. The events described
refer to a possibility which existed in the past.
      Browne compares the element -en with Lepsius’ (1880:113—114) marker of a
so-called electivum. According to Lepsius, it is mostly used with the preterit, and
from his examples it actually seems to be a form of the irrealis. Although Lepsius
lists paradigms for the present and perfect with -en, there seems unfortunately to
be only one instance in the texts:
(GM 14.5)
janoos-een-kos-san denaar       imil-tusko-logo        meskiin      wee-kuu-g__   tir-oo-j-een-kos-san

 the Old Nobiin examples above. The evidence, however, is too scarce for both
 Old and Modern Nobiin, to draw any conclusion. It can only be said that an ele-
 ment -en seems to have existed already at the Old Nobiin stage which marked an
 irrealis, but seldom used. More on conditional clauses will be presented and
 discussed in chapter 11 on syntax.","[106, 107, 108, 109, 110]"

 9. Periphrastics
Old Nobiin had a wide range of periphrastic constructions which were lost in the
course of the development towards the modern                  language. Browne (1982:26ff.;
 1989:27ff.) was the first to group the different constructions under the heading
“periphrastics” without, however, giving any detailed analysis of the specified
uses of the forms. Old Nobiin periphrastics have in common that they are formed
by attaching in- ‘to be’ or its equivalent to a participle, predicative or indicative.
The resulting constructions are demonstrated with the verb doll- ‘to love’:
Participle periphrastics              doll-il in-
Predicative periphrastics             doll-ira in-
Indicative periphrastics              doll-ina in-Different verbs or elements which presumably have a verbal origin can take the
place of in- ‘to be’. Not all of them can be found in all three types of periphrastic
construction. The following chart shows the different verbal elements and their
distribution:
-men-/-min-            ‘not to be’, negation         (part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
-(a)n-                 ‘to become’, inchoative       (part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
-g(a/i)r-              causative                     (part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
-ke-/-ki-/-k-          habitual                      (part. per.)
-in-                   ‘to be’                       (part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
-dal-/dar-             ‘to be’                       (part.   per, pred. per.)
-dul-                  ‘to be’                       (part.   per., pred. per.)
-au-                   ‘to do, to make’              (part.   per.)
-k(a)n-                ‘to be’                       (part.   per.)
-kinn-                 ‘be without’                  (part. per.)
-medd-                 “to be full’                  (pred. per.)
-ok-                   ‘to be’                       (part. per.)Browne (1989:27) at first regarded the periphrastic indicative as an emphatic
variant of the non-periphrastic construction which is semantically comparable to
the admirative, the other two he interpreted as mere stylistic variants of the non-
periphrastic constructions. After a more thorough analysis of the data at hand
(Browne 1991:60) he explained the indicative periphrastics with in- and men- as
focus constructions. Participle and predicative periphrastics he regarded as being                                                                                           119
employed to topicalize the verb and “thus to yield the O.N. equivalent of a cleft
sentence, either substantival or adjectival” (Browne 1991:60).
  There is, however, another aspect to be considered here. Four of the elements
mentioned above are part of periphrastic constructions with clearly defined
grammatical          functions     as    negative,     inchoative,         causative,   and    habitual/
imperfective. There is no non-periphrastic alternative to these periphrastics. In
this, they differ from constructions with other verbal elements. From the perspec-
tive of Modern Nobiin, these are of special importance because they are pre-
served, though no longer as periphrastics.
   As the first four constructions will be discussed in detail in the following
chapters, some examples of periphrastic constructions with other elements will
be given below.","[118, 119, 120]"

                                                                                                        121
9.1 NegationThe negation is one of the numerous periphrastic constructions of Old Nobiin.
Undoubtedly, it is one of the most important and frequent periphrastic construc-
tions as there is no non-periphrastic negation documented. It is built with the
verb men-/min- ‘not to be’ which goes back to an even older prefixed negation
m- + -in-/-en- ‘to be’. In accordance with its important function in the language,
men-/min- can be used in all three types of periphrastic formations, i.e. it can
follow a participle, predicative or indicative. In many instances, emphatic post-
position -/o is attached to the negative verb. Examples for the different types of
periphrastic constructions are:Participle Periphrastic

kop-ona               men-a
€at-2SGPRETIIND       not to be-3SGPRES
‘it is not that you ate’The indicative periphrastic seems to be rare and even more infrequent in the
documentary texts. Amongst eighteen negative constructions in the texts of Qasr
Ibrim III, none is represented by the indicative periphrastic. This seems to con-
form with an interpretation of the indicative periphrastics as a focus construction
which is not only rare but was also lost in the process of language change. On the
contrary,      reduced        participle   and      predicative   periphrastics   are   predominantly
 122
                                                                                                          eer tee

 documented in these texts. The reduction can go so far as nothing is left of the
 original periphrastic construction, e. g.

el-men-ami
find-not to be-JUSSPRES3SG‘let (him) not find’ (complete loss)The examples with reduced participle and predicative or complete loss of marker
lead over to Modern Nobiin. Here too, the formerly independent verb min-/men-
expresses the negation. In most of the tense/aspect paradigms, a variant muun- is
used. Lepsius, however, presents different forms for 24 person singular and
3"" person plural where old -min- is still preserved. Werner’s paradigm seems to
be further reduced by analogy. There is no trace left of the former periphrastic
construction.         The       element   -min/-muun-     is inserted      between   verbal   basis anc
ending. The paradigm of the negative present is:
                     Werner (1987:159)                    Lepsius (1880:115)

3PL                  -muuna (-muunna)                    -min(n)anPersonal endings are highly reduced. In Lepsius’ paradigm only the Ist and 3"" per-
son singular coincide. Werner’s list shows that the negation was further simpli-
fied because -muun               also replaced the      Ist person plural ending still present at
Lepsius’ time. The origin of -muun remains enigmatic as there is no trace of this
variant in Old Nobiin. Although                 -i- and -u- often interchange         in Old Nobiin,
                                                                                                    123
there doesn’t seem to be one example of it in the case of the negative verb. It can
be speculated whether another negative verb, i. e. mon-/mun- ‘to hate, reject, be
reluctant’ (= m-on- ‘not to love’), forms the basis of this paradigm. There Is,
however, no evidence supporting this suggestion. In all probability, the influence
of the emphatic particle -/o which was regularly suffixed to the negative verb in
Old Nobiin is responsible for the change. A regressive vocalic assimilation might
have led to the change from -i-/-e- to -u-.
   For the preterit, the endings of Old Nobiin were completely replaced by the
innovated complex with -kun- which is only rarely used in the positive form (see
chapter 10.8). The paradigm of the negative preterit is:
                        Werner (1987:160)                            Lepsius (1880:118)

3PL                     -kum-muuna                                   -kum-minnanIn Lepsius’ list, we find an additional form with -min- in the 24 person plural.
Lepsius’ examples reveal that the negative forms originally follow the adjunctive
-a (see chapter 10) which is dropped with verbs ending in a vowel or single con-
sonant.
   Lepsius as well as Abel list some forms which they regard as remains of an old
 preterit negative. In the Ermenne narrative, there is one example Abel discusses:
 (Erm. 129)
 illa    buruu-kududi   wirk-a-kum-mun
 only   girl-small      throw-ADJ-PRET-NEG3SG
 wirko-moon-on-gooni      sultani   issig-j-on
 throw-?-3SGPRET-and      sultan    asked-OBJ-3SGPRET ‘Only the little girl didn’t throw, and (as) she didn’t throw the sultan asked her:” Abel interprets -moon- in the second part of the sentence as variant of the negative
 -muun and denies a possible relationship with the verb moon- ‘to not want to, to re-
 ject’. There are various reasons why Abel’s interpretation seems highly improb-
 able. Firstly, -moon- would be another variant of -miin/-muun- which is only docu-
 mented once. Secondly, Abel doesn’t explain why the regular negative preterit is
 found in the first part of the sentence, but not in the second one. Thirdly, he doesn’t
 explain why wirk- is followed by -o- in the second instance, by adjunctive -a in
 the first one. Correctly understood, -moon- actually is the aforementioned indepen-
 dent verb, together with wirk-, they form a verbal complex with both verbs mark-
 ed as 3d person singular preterit. The whole sentence should be analysed as:
  124
(Erm. 129)
ila     buruu-kududi      wirk-a-kum-mun
only     girl-small       throw-ADJ-PRET-NEG3SG

‘Only the little girl didn’t throw, and (as) she rejected to throw the sultan asked them:’Although Abel (1913:68) collected a complete paradigm for his remnant nega-
tive preterit, it has to be asked whether or not a communicative problem between
him and his informant has to be assumed. None of the other forms in the para-
digm are documented in his narrative.
   In a similar way, Lepsius (1880:120) was convinced to have found a few rem-
nants of a former negative preterit. His only example comes from the translations
of the gospel and is wrongly interpreted as pluperfect:
(GM 9, 32)
tariin bannitta        fehemi-ken-kom-mes-san
his    speech         —_understand-IMPERF-PRET-NEG-3PLPRET“they hadn’t understood his speech’As we find the regular -men- (and not -moon-) in this sentence, it is more con-
                                                                                                           nen
vincing        than    Abel’s    example.       The   corresponding       form     listed    by   Werner
(1987:239) is -ken-kum-muuna. On the basis of this one example, Lepsius also
reconstructs a complete paradigm which he calls a negative pluperfect. It will be
argued below that Lepsius misunderstood -ken as a variant of -kun, the former
actually being the marker of the imperfective (sometimes habitual).","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"

 ‘and also all who were in her house were barren’ Here, we find a predicative periphrastic construction (see chapter 9) in mir-a-
gue-lo is-sana with a literal meaning of approximately ‘they were the being
barren’. Again, the relative clause is marked as predicative, mifJan- ‘all’ is the
referent and takes the suffix of the subjective. This is an example for Type 3
construction because the main verb is in the indicative.
    Finally, Satzinger (1990:196) lists an additional type of relative clause which
is characterized by a referent with predicative ending followed by -sin. The latter
is one of all in all three elements which Browne (1997) described as Old Nobiin
emphatic particles and which fulfilled a wide range of different functions. The
relative clause has either the participle or the subjunctive.
    In a sales contract from Qasr Ibrim, we find such a construction in a documen-
tary context:
(IT III 37, 19-20)
jan-a-sin            etti-ji-sil-gu-I-lon                         nap-il     20-lo
price-PRED-COP       receive-OBJPL-PARTPRETII-PL-SUBJ-and         gold-SUBJ 20-COP
‘and the price which I received is 20 gold’Again, the first part consists of a nominal sentence. Predicative -a- is enforced by
-sin. A noun in the predicative followed by -sin as referent of a relative clause is
also documented several times in the more formal religious texts (Browne 1996).
The verb of the relative clause is a participle preterit II marked as plural subjec-
tive because the price consists of several pieces of gold. Literally, the meaning of
the whole sentence is ‘it is 20 gold it is the price having been received’.
   In Modern Nobiin, various changes conceming the construction of relative
clauses can be observed. As has been mentioned before predicative and subjunc-
tive have disappeared and also the once omnipresent emphatic/focus/copulative
particles -/o and -sin were lost.
    Instead of the lost constructions, Modern Nobiin occasionally employs two
clauses marked as indicatives, one of which functions as main, the other one as
relative clause, as in:
                                                                                                    211

tied, no one ever mounted it’. Although this is not rendered in the English trans-
lation there seems to be two relative clauses in the Nubian version. As in one of
the examples from old Nobiin above, one relative clause is embedded between
the referent and its modifier which both have the suffixes of the objective case.
The literal meaning of the clause is ‘a donkey’s foal which is tied’ and the stative
verb is marked as indicative. The subject of the relative clause is the object of the
main clause. The second relative clause is juxtaposed and has the suffixes of the
negative indicative. A new subject is introduced in the second relative clause but
its object is identical to the object of the main clause.
    More often, we find relative clauses with participles, as in the next two exam-
ples from the gospel of St. Mark:
(GM 5.32)
gelb-on                     (iden             saw-ohe              tiiraa

‘he buries him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock’t is interesting to note that although Nobiin is basically a verb final language the
main verb is clause initial in both instances. Also in both sentences, the main
verb is followed by a postpositional phrase into which the relative clause is em-
bedded. The postposition is clause final. Only in the first example, however, the
participle is marked as object.
    In the Ermenne narrative, we find various examples with participles in the
relative clauses. The following one shows the expected word order with the ref-
erent in front and the main verb in clause final position:
(Erm. 15)
wide[ideni (in-wilit-ta                   hidm-i ))——_iig-a-tir-on

212
 The following example shows striking similarities to some of the Old Nobiin
 examples because the pronominal subject of the relative clause is marked as
 genitive. The referent, on the other hand, is marked as object according to its re-
 lationship to the subject of the relative clause, as opposed to its status in the main
 clause.
 (GM 11,21)

clauses:
(Erm 31)

ashes, and eat’The main clause is marked as interrogative and consists of a verbal complex with
a pronominal subject ir mug-os-a juu kab-o ‘did you leave, go, eat?’. The relative
clause is represented by a present indicative, udr-eedaag-a-te-rii, the other one
by a participle marked as object, okk-a-/fi-i-ka. The first one takes the position of
the object of the transitive verb mug- ‘leave’, the second one modifies the loca-
tive noun phrase ‘diidee’.

subject in sentence final position. The copula -/in is added which regularly ex-
presses identity of two nouns or pronouns. Here, the second noun is the unex-
pressed subject of the relative clause.
   Lepsius (1880:67ff.) describes an independent relative pronoun faa in his
grammar. Werner (1987:128) addresses Lepsius’ suggestion but is doubtful about
the actual function of faa. He cites Almkvist (1911:248) and von Massenbach
(1933:214) who translate ‘only’ which also corresponds to a translation given by
one of Abel’s informants (Abel 1913:50). Werner’s isolated examples, such as
                                                                                                             213
ay taa ay lii, allow the translation ‘I am who I am’ as well as ‘I am only I’. It
helps to look at the following example from Lepsius’ translation of the gospel
because it documents faa followed by the Arabic loan bes ‘only’.
(GM 2,26)
kaba    mugaddaas-ka_        kab-on           taa    bes      kaahiin-ii   kab-innan
bread   holy-OB)             eat-3SGPRET      REL    only     priest-PL     eat-3PLPRES
‘he ate the consecrated bread which only priests eat’As it seems improbable that ‘only’ is rendered twice in one clause, the example
can be regarded as evidence for the use of faa as an element which introduces
relative clauses.
   Amongst several different contexts Abel documents fa(a) in his narrative.
There is one which seems to correspond to Lepsius’ example:
(Erm. 76)
ta-in         eye          irin   kene    simark-a-fi-e-[y]                         ai-logo   mola-ije
REL-DEM?      [she said]   your   so     be angry-ADJ-STAT-INFPRES{she said]        I-to      close-[she said]‘this which [she said] makes you angry-[she said], is easy for me’
The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘that which is your being angry about, is
close to me’. Whether -in actually represents the demonstrative or is a remnant of
-in ‘to be’ is difficult to decide.
      Lepsius (1880:391) documents another context in which faa is used:
(GM 2,10)
taa  uk-koo     n_irber-okom
FIN     you-PL-and   know-2PLPRES‘and so that you may know’Here, faa seems to introduce a final clause. All things considered there isn’t
enough evidence to draw definite conclusions concerning the origin of faa. As is,
however, documented for other languages too, the element might be related to
the 3-4 person singular pronoun far (see e.g. Heine & Reh 1984:280). There
doesn’t seem to be any evidence for this type of construction in Old Nobiin. This
might explain why only very few instances can be found in the known texts. An
equivalent can presumably be found in those relative clauses introduced by de-
monstrative pronoun in.
    Lepsius (ibid.) describes another construction as equivalent of a relative
clause. This is introduced by an interrogative pronoun and interpreted by him as
an indirect question. His examples are from the translation of the gospel:
214
      (GM 14.44)
      nai-gaa_  ai     fa-daawoos-ii__tal-lin    takkaa kogorakir dumm-anaa

      “whom I will kiss, he is the one; seize him’
     (GM 4.9)

     who ear-OB)       have-PARTPRES    hear-INF-OBJ    —_—hear-3SGJUSS
     “he who has ears to hear, let him hear’    Although interrogative pronoun yai- is documented in Old Nobiin only a few
    examples are found in the texts. None                   of the contexts can be interpreted as
    equivalent of a relative clause.
       Summing up the different constructions of relative clauses in Modern Nobiin
    presented above, the following overview can be put together:
            . indicative + noun-OBJ + indicative (+ modifier [+ postposition])
NDnkwnd —
            . indicative + noun-(OBJ) + participle-(OBJ) (+ modifier [+ postposition])
            . noun + noun-OBjJ + participle + indicative
            - noun(-OBJ) + noun-GEN + participle + indicative
            . (noun) + noun-OBJ + indicative + taa (+ noun) + indicative
            . nai(-OBJ) + different types of clauses                  °
 The overview is far from being exhaustive. A systematic study of Nobiin syntax
 will presumably uncover additional types and enable more systematic categoriza-
 tion. It can, however, be concluded that the type most frequently used employs
 the participle in the relative clause. These types more or less correspond to the
 construction in Old Nobiin presented above. Juxtaposition of two indicatives is
 also documented rather frequently and presumably corresponds to a construction
 with subjunctive in the relative clause in Old Nobiin. The types with introducing
 pronouns are rarely used and are not present in Old Nobiin.","[210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"

      According to Werner (1987:145), the imperative singular of Modern Nobiin is
 identical to the verbal base (e. g. unni ‘give birth!’) and the plural shows a suffix
-an following the ending -i of the verbal base which is, however, often omitted.
Unfortunately, no further information on the origin of the endings and the use
and function of the imperative are given. Werner also makes no mentioning of
jussive forms. One hundred years earlier, Lepsius (1880:139) listed a more com-
plex paradigm (with tokk- ‘to shake’) for the imperative/jussive.
2sG           tokk-ee, tokk-e, tokk-eiaa
3sG           too-ciaa
2PL           tokk-anaa, tokk-an, tokk-anaia
3PL           took-anaiaaThe origin and function of the different endings will be discussed below.
   The negative imperative or jussive of Modern Nobiin evidently corresponds to
Old Nobiin “vetitive” forms. Lepsius (1880:141) points out that these endings
follow -a which is the marker of direct speech (see below), thus adding another
correspondence to the Old Nobiin forms:
Lepsius (1880:141)           SG (-a)-tam/tamece       PL (-a)-tam(m)an/tam(m)anaa
Wemer (1987: 146)            SG -tam                  PL -tamanThe optional -a is no longer documented by Werner (ibid.) who also doesn’t
mention the use of the endings in the 3 person singular and plural. Examples of
the use as negative imperative or jussive are found in the gospel of St. Mark and
in the Ermenne text. Below, some examples are given:

the formerly present -so ending are found. Lepsius’ positive paradigm and the
last two negative examples, however, show that the ending was replaced by a
variety of suffixes. These necessitate a longer excurse on the origin of these
elements and their various functions.","[88, 89, 90]"
"
                                                                                                              149
In the first example, jan- ‘to trade, to exchange’ combined with -oos obtains the
meaning of ‘to sell’ which also implies a motion away, in this case away from a
seller. In the second example, jan- combined with the verb -ed ‘to take’ has the
meaning of ‘to buy’ which also implies a motion towards the buyer.
   The presumably earliest instance of jana-os- can be found in Lectionary
112.10 where it has the meaning of ‘to redeem’. This could be evidence of an
origin of jan(a)-os- as ‘to buy off’ with a secondary expansion of the meaning to
the more general ‘sell’. The original verbal complex denoting ‘sell’ seems to be
jan-a den-/tir-, a combination of the verbs ‘to exchange/to trade’ and ‘to give’.
 Both verbal complexes are documented in the Ibrim texts, but only jan-os seems
to have survived in modern Nobiin (see below).
       Most of the other examples from Old Nobiin show -ed/-it/-eet attached to an-
other verb denoting ‘to take’. Reference points concerning the direction indicated
by -ed are the morphologically marked subjects of the sentences:
(M. 3,15-16)
man _ itt-il-lon              kumpu-k(a) en-et-a                  ?

 tipit-il          ¥ [kka]    dum-it-in
 evening-SUBJ       3PL-OBJ   take-DIR-3SGSUBPRES
 ‘as the evening takes them’ As to the origin or further development of the verbal complex, one example can
 be found which shows -ed in an ambiguous position between the original verb
 ‘to take’ and a marker of directionality or even resultative marker. The sentence
 (IT Il, 51.5)
 petti-ka      nol-a               ej-j-ara-sin
 date-OB)      gulp (down)-ADJ     _DIR-PLOBJ-PREDPRETI-EMPH
 is translated by Brown as ‘...I took the dates and gulped them down’ but analo-
 gous to the aforementioned examples it could also be rendered as ‘...1 gulped the
 dates down’. With regard to the further development of the complex, a transla-
 tion ‘I completely gulped the dates down’ seems also adequate.
    It can be concluded that an opposition between morphologically marked di-
 rectionality—“motion towards” and “motion away”—existed in Old Nobiin. The
 150
 markers were independent verbs which semantically contained the direction they
 indicated. Both constructions, however, were rarely used. Only very few in-
 stances of the verbal complex with -ed could be found, some more of the one
 with -(oJos. -(o)Jos and -ed follow the adjunctive in this complex which can,
 however, be omitted. There is at least one instance where -ed follows the indica-
 tive (jan-ona is-sana) which looks like a periphrastic indicative.
     The question arises what happened to these constructions in Modern Nobiin.
 In contrast to Old Nobiin, verbal complexes with the suffix -(o)os as a second or
 last element are abundant in the modern language. In Abel’s Ermenne narrative,
 more than one hundred complexes with -(oJos can be counted within the two
 hundred sentences. In spite of the extensive occurrence of -(o)os complexes all
 authors found it rather difficult to understand and analyze its function and mean-
 ing. More than one hundred years ago, Richard Lepsius (1880:156) wrote about
 the use of -(ojos:
Eine sehr gewdhnliche Erweiterung der Verbalstimme ist die in -ose. Sie kann sich fast
mit jedem Verbum verbinden, [...], ohne daB sich eine bestimmte Verinderung der Bedeu-
 tung nachweisen lieBe. Es scheint, daB sie nur den Nachdruck vermehrt, mit welchem ein
 Wort oder eine Form gebraucht werden soll, oder da8 nur der Tonfall den Sprechenden
 veranlaBt, das Verbum mit oder ohne diese schwere Endung zu gebrauchen, so willkirlich
 bedient man sich derselben anscheinend und nicht selten in einem und demselben Satz.
Lepsius had no knowledge of Old Nobiin when he wrote his grammar. Thus, he
(1880:156, 380) considered it rather peculiar that the verb jan- ‘to trade’ signi-
fied ‘to buy’, when -ed was suffixed (jan-ed), and ‘to sell’? when -(o)os was at-
tached (jan-os). These examples, however, show that at least remnants of the
erstwhile directional function of the two verbs are preserved in the lexicalize
verbs ‘to buy’ and ‘to sell’. Lepsius seems to interpret -(oJos as some sort
emphasizer, but he was willing to admit that he was not able to derive a m
special meaning. Two examples from the translation of the gospel analyzed
him show almost identical contexts with and without -(oJos.

Satan     come out-DIR-3SGPRETMore important is his observation of the more or less unrestricted use of the
suffix with all kinds of verbs. He furthermore states a prevailing occurrence of
-(o)os with the preterit and imperative—the latter conforming with an emphasiz-
ing function—and a more rare use with the present or future. On the basis of the
texts collected by him, Lepsius, however, concludes that the element is restricted
to the 3"" person singular and plural, and never occurs with 1st or 2""4 persons, an
                                                                                    151
allegation which is not supported by his translation of the gospel. Although most
of the -(o)os complexes are found with the preterit, this is at least to some extent
owing to the sort of texts available which are predominantly narratives in the
preterit. The next two examples present a verbal complex with -(o)os followed
by the imperative and present.

Reinisch (1879:55ff.) speaks of the simple form of the verb and an extension
with -(o)os which he describes as the actual taking place of the action denoted by
the simple verb. Thus, he distinguishes fog ‘to beat, to strike’ and fog-os ‘to actu-
ally beat/strike, to really beat/strike’. From this primary meaning, he derives a
secondary one: fog-os ‘to already strike’. In another of his examples, the simple
form mafa fal-in is translated by him as ‘the sun rises (it is her nature to do so)’
whereas the present form mafa fal-os-in has the presumed meaning of ‘the sun is
already rising, carries out the rising’, and the past mafa fal-os-on denotes ‘the
sun has already risen’. Reinisch does not mention any restriction as to the use of
tense and aspect for the verbal complex with -(oJos.
   A somewhat different approach can be found in Abel’s (1913:71) attempt at
 interpreting the function of -(o)os. Quite familiar is his statement that in many
 examples a difference in the meaning of verbs with or without the element is not
 identifiable. Abel quotes his Nubian                 informant who       illustrates that the simple
 verb fal- ‘come out, go out’ differs from the verbal complex fal-os in emphasiz-
 ing the being completely outside. The complexes are furthermore—and this is
 new—supposed to mark an explicit or implicit object. Thus, the Nubian infor-
 mant distinguishes between fog-in ‘he strikes’ and fog-oos-in ‘he strikes him’.
 Abel tried to verify this allegation and counted only six complexes with -(o)os
 without explicit or implicit object out of altogether thirty-four occurrences.
 Again, most of the examples from the Ermenne narrative are in the preterit:

"       2.3 Linguistic Variation within the Texts       Although Old Nobiin is undoubtedly an earlier variant of Modern Nobiin, it was
       not in the strictest sense a standardized language. A close look at the text reveals
       some variations which shed light on the linguistic background of the scribes.
       These variations are to be expected as the region was linguistically heterogene-
       ous and it would oversimplify the situation to assume that all scribes were moth-
       er tongue speakers of Old Nobiin. In addition to that it goes without saying that
       loanwords from closely related Dongolese/Kenzi also spoken          in Nubia at the
       time of written Old Nobiin were borrowed into the language.
                                                                                               int as ET,

   The sales contract IT III, 36 is one of the texts of special interest in matters of
linguistic variation. It concerns the sale of land owned by a woman named Ka-
popi to another woman named Neuesi. With regard to content, it is fascinating
because it gives information about the position of women in Nubia at the end of
the 12th century (see chapter 13.8). Linguistically, it is interesting because it
contains numerous place names (see chapter 13.10) and most notably words not
found elsewhere. One of these is ana-biti (36 ii 3), presumably a beverage. It is
found as ana-piti in IT 34 1 29, and the second element -piti presumably corre-
sponds to -pitti in ChN. 5.11 and St. 22.5 where it is also found in a compound
denoting a beverage. The phoneme 6 of ana-biti is not part of the original inven-
tory of Nobiin and is also not found as allophonic variant of p. The modern cor-
respondence of Old Nobiin p is f so that it is not evidence of regular sound
change. -biti actually represents the expected Dongolese/Kenzi form because Old
Nobiin p, Nobiin f regularly correspond to Dongolese/Kenzi 5 and vice versa.
Although a scribal error cannot be excluded, the writing variant can also indicate
a different linguistic background. The latter assumption is supported by another
lexeme found in IT III 36, kal- ‘to eat’. The verb ‘to eat’ is one of the few lex-
emes diagnostic for classifying a wordlist as Nobiin or Dongolese/Kenzi by
origin. kal- is the Dongolese/Kenzi word shared by most of the other Nubian
languages whereas Old and Modern Nobiin have the isolated word kap-/kab-.
IT III 36 is the only instance where kal- is documented in writing but in the same
text, also kap- is found.   In the last lines of document   36, we get to know   about
the fee for the scribe who was paid in kind. He was supposed to receive one kol-
in tewiti which corresponds to modern Dongolese/Kenzi kal deewdi ‘flat bread’.
kol- is merely a variant of kal- described above. The alternative use of vowels o
and a is documented again in the same text with kap- and kop- ‘to eat’.
    In the documentary text from Qasr Ibrim, it can be observed that foreign words
or loanwords from Arabic enter into Old Nobiin. In the sales contract IT III 36, the
Arabic word ouati ‘wadi, valley’ is used, only documented in one other instance
in Sale 9 as wati. The use of Arabic wadi is remarkable because regarding the
modern languages, it is restricted to Kenzi. In Nobiin, we find the original farki
or the much more common Arabic loan khor both meaning ‘valley’. Armbruster
(1965:103) lists the latter in the form hoor also for Dongolese.
   Finally, egeti ‘kettle’ is another word which is found only in this text and in
modem   Kenzi, but not in Modern Nobiin.
   A close look at the Old Nobiin dictionary compiled by Browne (1996) on the
basis of the texts reveals that many entries have modern correspondences in
Dongolese and Kenzi, but not in Nobiin. Although numerous of these “missing”
correspondences can be explained by a later loss or/and replacement by Arabic
loanwords in Nobiin, this explanation cannot satisfy for all of the entries. One of
                                                                                    21
the longer texts, Chrysostomus Nubianus (Browne 1984), contains many Old
Nobiin words not documented in any other text. Whether this means that the text
was written in a dialect or style not preserved elsewhere or that it is only a coin-
cidence cannot be resolved. It has to be kept in mind that for the present, we have
a closed corpus of texts and can only work with what is on hand.","[20, 21, 22]"

should be noted that the verbs which take the purposive suffix are not marked for
tense/aspect.
    Another formation of purpose clauses is also based on the endings of the con-
ditional (see chapter 7) to which once more the complementizer -a is added. As
is the case for the conditional a complete paradigm can be put together for the
purposive consisting of
 IsG                     -koioa
2/38G.                   -konnoa
 1/2PL                   -kouoa
3PL                      -koannoa (-kuannoa)One example from the Miracle of St. Menas is:
(M. 9. 5-8)

‘and the father said to the boy: “O in truth, cooking bring it to me, in order that I may eat”The example shows that the construction could be used, if the subject of the
purpose clause was not identical to the subject of the main clause. As for the
conditional, there is also a variant with -ka which is documented in one of the
Qasr Ibrim texts:
(IT III 30.26-27)
epimaxosi_sippi-n            aueir      kemso-ka   ni-kr-a             an    oi-n         tri    tauo

 194
 Corresponding to the conditional, a form -koa(lo)                      in which the person      is not
 marked is also documented.
      Finally, in a third construction the imperative in connection with the verb il-
 ‘to say’ and complementizer -a can serve to express a purpose clause (see also
 Excurse 2 where additional examples are given), as in:
 (Lec. 112.10)
 ted-in       tauo   da-l-gu-ka         janos-ij-e-s-a
 they-GEN     under be-PART-PL-OBJ      redcem-PL-IMPER-EMPH-COMP
 ‘in order that he might redeem those who are under the law’ Looking at Modern Nobiin, the question arises what happened to these different
 formations of purposes clauses. Although the conditional construction based on
 -ka has been preserved the conditional-based paradigm for the purposive pre-
 sented above seems to have completely disappeared. Corresponding to Old No-
 biin is a formation with an element -eenii which still has the variants -oonii and
-aani. Contrary, however, to the construction in Old Nobiin, the suffix is attached
to the tense/aspect/person marker of the verb, as in the following examples from
the Ermenne narrative and the Gospel of St. Mark:
(Erm. 103)
ai    fa-kir-a          ikka         irii   _firge-k-ka           fa-aaw-a-tee-r-een
|     IFUT-come-ADJ     you-OBJ      you    wish-PARTPRES-OBJ     IFUT-d0-ADJ-BEN-1SGPRES-PURP
‘I will come, in order that I do for you what you want’In this example, the suffixing of the purpose marker to the tense/aspect/person
suffix is one indicator for a construction which basically differs from the one in
Old Nobiin. Main clause and purpose clause are related as a verbal complex with
the main verb marked as adjunctive and only the verb in the purpose clause tak-
ing the tense/aspect/person suffix. The purpose clause includes a pronominal
object and an additional object clause consisting of the present participle with the
suffix -ka.
    This construction can also be used if the subjects of main and purpose clause
differ, as in
(GM   1,17)
abaag annaa kaj-j-an                   ai   fa    ukkaa         ademi-ri-in
behind of me come-PL-IMPERPL           |    FUT   you-PL-OB)    man-PL-GEN
Saiaada-kaj-j-ir-eeni
fisherman-CAUS-PL-1 SGPRES-PURP
‘follow me so that | will make you fishers of men’
                                                                                                   195
Because of the different subjects, the two verbs cannot be constructed as verbal
complex but have to take separate tense/aspect/number markers.
   In the last example, we also find separate markers in the clauses presumably
due to the imperative in the main clause:
(GM 6,31)
tann-ana-ion               falee    wee-lakidekka_tiig-all-ooni
gO-IMPERPL-he said         desert   one-toalittle     sit-FUT-PURP
“go”, he said, “to a desert in order to stay a little”In all three examples, the verb is marked as future/intentional, the old as well as
the innovated formation are used. In the last sentence from the gospel, the imper-
sonal purpose clause has the future infinitive and is not marked for person.
    Werner (1987:166ff.) seems to be confused with regard to the correct segmen-
tation of the suffixes when he categorizes the purposive (“Begriindungs- oder
Finalform”) as present tense paradigm. He presents the following ending:
IsG                 -leeni/-reeni                          IPL              -looni/-rooni
2sG                 -nameeni                              2PL               -lokomeetii
3sG                 -naani                                3PL               -innanaaniThese actually are the present tense suffixes to which the endings discussed
above were added. As Werner has no examples in his sentences but only the
paradigm he collected, it can only be assumed that in a context, the innovated
future prefix would have been required.
   In most instances, an additional purpose marker ken ‘in order to, so that’ is
found which either introduces the purpose clause or is prefixed to the verb, as in
(GM    11,25)
ken             uffab           semaa-la_    semb       unni-ga    fa-saamahi-n-aani

(GM 15,32)

we-and see-ADJ inorderto            believe-OFUT-1 PLPRESPURP
‘so that we may see and believe’The origin of this element is obscure because it is not found in Old Nobiin. The
habitual marker -ken- which is suffixed to the verb is an unlikely candidate for a
 196
 prefixed purposive marker. The verb kan-/ken-/kin- ‘to be, become’ is not docu-
 mented in contexts which indicates the beginning of a development towards a
 purposive marker. The same applies for the verb ken- ‘to place’ which is docu-
 mented as first verb in verbal complexes in Old Nobiin. To interpret some of
 these constructions as purpose clauses would be more fantasy than plausibility.
 Thus, it has to be concluded that the origin of -ken- remains a mystery and that
Old Nobiin gives no hint towards its unraveling. This is all the more unfortunate
as in the modern language, ken can replace all other markers of a purpose clause
and serve as the only indicator for this type of a clause. Examples are:
(Erm. 61)
iboo-n-deni              ikka          gelaabiye uwoo-ga         jan-a         semmi-logo arrauwi-j-a

“for your father’s wife has bought two dresses for you, spread poison on them and deposited them for
you in order to kill you’This type of construction also has the infinitive marked as future/intentional. In
the translation of the gospel, we find another construction consisting of ken +
future/intentional infinitive and suffix -ea which, as has been described before,
consists of infinitive -e and reduced -a (see Excurse 2). An example is:
(GM 16.1)
jaan-isan      gatti-gaa = takkaa_        ken              kusm-all-eaa
buy-3PLPRET    spices-OB)  him            inorderto        anoint-OFUT-PURP
‘they bought spices in order to anoint him’With the exception of innovated ken, this formation most probably goes back
the third construction of Old Nobiin described above consisting of the imperativ
in connection with the verb i/- ‘to say’ and complementizer -a.","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"
"6.3 Old Future/Intentional/IrrealisZyhlarz was the first to describe in detail what he called the Old Nubian Future
Tense. His presentation showed some discrepancies and was in need of clarifica-
tion. This clarification came from Hintze (1977) who tried to organize the differ-
ent endings of the future and to make a new attempt at interpreting the alternative
forms. He, however, kept Zyhlarz’ original classification into future I and fu-
ture II which he arranged into three levels respectively, the meaning of which he
was unable to determine on the basis of the data at his disposal. He assumed that
the different levels express different aspects or Aktionsarten.
   Browne (1982:12) objected to Hintze’s complicated classification and ex-
plained that the two suffixes of the future, -d- and -ad-/-ar, which are present in
Old Nobiin, are allomorphs rather than two different types of future. The form
with -d- follows vowels, n-, /- or r-, -ad-/-ar follow a consonant or double nn-, /l-
or rr-. The suffixes of the so-called future tense consist of the allomorphic future
 participles -aril-/-dil, -del + personal endings. The paradigms are the following:
                    Indicative      Subjunctive                 Indicative    | Subjunctive
 IsG                -arre           -arri                       -dire           -di/eri
2SG                 -anna           -an                         -di/ena         -di/en
3sG                 -anna           -an                         -di/ena         -di/en
 IPL                -arro           -arrou                      -diro           -di/erou
2PL                 -arro           -arrou                      -diro           -di/erou
3PL                 -arrana         -arran                      -dirana         -di/eran This form which has traditionally been called future tense by the different au-
 thors actually fulfils a variety of functions, as can be shown with examples from
 different texts.
     Temporal expressions with future meaning are uncommon in Old Nobiin
 texts. Sometimes, however, e//e ‘time’ is used which in these cases seems to
 function as an adverb with meaning ‘in the future’ (Browne 2002:77):
 (ChN 5.16-17)
 in   elle           eli         u-k          uskr-a      tij-j-arri-ka
 this (inthe future) today       you-PL-OBJ   place-ADJ   OBJ-PLOBJ-1SGOFUTSUB-OB)
 ‘that which I shall set before you today’ 84
With eli ‘today’ we have another temporal adverb which marks the period of
time at which the event is going to happen. The event is going to happen on the
same day but sometimes later. The point of reference here is the moment of
speaking.
   Corresponding to the religious content of many of the texts the so-called fu-
ture is often present in prophecies or annunciations. The first example belongs to
the gospel according to St. Matthew where an angel appears to Joseph in a dream
and announces the birth of Jesus:
(Lect. 100.3-4)
tan tanis-ka    =emmannucla          ok-arrana
his name-OB) Immanuel                call-3PLOFUTIND
‘[and when she bears a son] they shall call his name Immanuel’Although not exactly prophetic, the next example from a personal letter contain-
ing an order for payment is predictive in that it foretells what will happen to the
addressee:
(IT 111 47, 7-8)
micl         ir-ia          pad-dina-lo
fault(?)     you-in         come forth-3SGOFUTIND-EMPH
‘The fault (?) in you will come forth’As in many languages of the world the old future of Nobiin is often found in
contexts where intention is expressed which leads over to the domain of mode
and modality, e. g.
(M. 4.15)
toukr-en       isgil        jo-din
leave-PART     where        go-2SGOFUTSUB
“When you leave, where will you go?’Many examples in this category contain conditional clauses, e. g.

old future which in various aspects seems to correspond to English constructions

he jiggled with his ear. “Habitual situations are customarily repeated on different
                                                                                                                     133
occasions”, as Bybee et al. (1994:127) described it. The other sentences might be
called habitual insofar as situations are narrated which extend over a prolonged
period of time in contrast to the accidental or momentary situation or action of
the story. This, however, can also be described as a durative form. Most of all,
they set some sort of background for the sequences of action within the narra-
tives which according to Hopper (1979, 1982) can be regarded as a general fea-
ture of imperfective forms.
    Comparing use and function of the -ke-/-ki-/-k-/-ken-complex in Old and
Modern Nobiin, some processes can be deduced. The use of -ke-/-ki-/-k- in peri-
phrastic constructions is evidence for a verbal origin of the element. The verb
had already undergone a process of desemanticization in Old Nobiin. -ke-/-ki-/-k-
periphrastics were not restricted as to tense but only used with the participle. The
original main function may have been to mark a habitual; it seems, however, that
it was generalized to an imperfective at the level of Old Nobiin. It might be due
to the generalization process that the construction with -ke-/-ki-/-k- is fairly
widespread in Old Nobiin. On the way to Modern Nobiin, the broad spectrum of
periphrastic constructions has disappeared. In the case of -ke-/-ki-/-k-
periphrastics the relevant paradigmatic distinctions were lost. Instead one mem-
ber of the paradigm, -ken-, replaced all the others. According to Browne
(1989:26), this an “expanded infinitive” which is, however, obscure in its origin.
The form is identical with the 3 person singular of the present subjunctive and
it is highly probable that this form was generalized. In Modern Nobiin, the con-
struction with -ken- can only take the suffixes of the past. Its prevailing function
seems to be an imperfective but it is only rarely used.","[133, 134]"
"9.5 Copulative Constructions For the sake of completeness, two additional periphrastic constructions have to
 be mentioned here. The following copulative constructions were much less
 common in Old Nobiin. Browne’s (1989:29) ‘predicative copulative’ is restricted
 to the 2™4 persons singular and plural. It complements the affirmative (see chap-
 ter 6.5) which provides the Ist and 34 persons. The suffixes -/e (SG) and -ke (PL)
 are attached to the predicative, in the plural -/- precedes in the present and fu-
 ture/intentional, -as- in the present and preterit. The forms documented in the
 texts are:
 Present              SG   --        PL_   -ra-l-ke, -(r-)as-ke
 Preterit I           SG   -ara-le   PL    -ar-as-ke
 Future/Intentional   sG   -dra-le   PL    -arra-l-ke
 134
Modern Nobiin has a full paradigm for the so-called affirmative which provides
enough reason for the disappearance of the form.
   Browne (ibid.) identified another periphrastic construction which he called
“indicative copulative”. Postposition -m/(a), otherwise known as following nouns
in the predicative, is suffixed to an indicative. The examples suggest that in these
cases it topicalizes the verb, as in:
(NC 20.5-6)
kim-mis-so-m             ni-mis-so-ma
Cat-NEG-IPLPRETIIIND-COP drink-NEG-1 PLPRETIIIND-COP
‘is it we did not eat, it is we did not drink’That these constructions were uncommon in Old Nobiin might be one reason
they completely disappeared like most of the other periphrastic constructions of
Old Nobiin.","[134, 135]"
"                                                                                               17]
          10.8 “Perfect(ive)”          This construction originates in a verbal complex with the verb kon-/kun-/ko- ‘to
          have’ (all three alternative forms are already present in Old Nobiin) as second
          verb. Such a complex is absent in the religious-theological texts, but Zyhlarz
          (1928:167) was the first to notice two examples of this complex as part of a graf-
          fito in Jebel Adda published by Griffith (1913:64ff.). The second verb follows
          the adjunctive -a- suffixed to the first verb and is marked as 34 person singular
          present subjunctive or indicative.

          find a total of five instances for kon-/kun-/ko- as second element in a complex in
          a corpus of 32 texts of different lengths. All examples but one are from personal
          letters or requests, one comes from a commercial transaction.

          nation-SUBJ approach-PERF-3SGPRESSUB
          ‘the nation having approached’          The example is rather clear-cut grammatically with adjunctive -a- deleted—as it
          is also found in similar constructions—and -ko- following the verb directly. In
          the next example, additional elements and another verb precede -ko-:
           (IT Ill 46.2-3)
           id-doko           nisiti   tor-a       pi-r-ko-n
           you-through cleansing      enter-ADJ   be-CAUS-PERF-3SGPRESSUB           ‘[after] he has caused (them) to enter cleansing through you’           This is a more complex example as Browne (1991:97) interprets a predicative
           periphrastic construction with -pi- ‘to be’ and reconstructs tor-ra pi- with the -r-
           of the predicative deleted. In his grammar (Browne 2002:59, n. 69), however, he
           came to the conclusion that -pi- is only found in participle periphrastics, because
           no example for preceding predicative can be found. It seems probable that it is           172
  not a periphrastic construction but rather a verbal complex and the verb for- is
  followed by adjunctive -a- instead of a predicative -ra-. The second verb in the
  complex is pi- ‘to be’ and the first half of the complex is thus resembling ‘stative
  constructions’ as they are discussed under 10.9. The complex is marked as causa-
  tive by suffix -r- and is completed by -ko ‘to have’ and the 3"" person singular
  subjunctive marker.
      In the next sentence, adjunctive -a- is present which seems to come along with
  the longer variant of ‘to have’ -kon-/-kun-. The complex is also marked as indica-
  tive.

  ‘he has kept you upon your throne’  The last two examples are in the preterit. Although the longer form -kon- is pre-
  sent, adjunctive -a- is missing in the first one.

  ‘the king has ordered you’  In summary,        it can be said that in most of the examples,   the second verb is
  marked as present, but two show past tense suffixes. In two instances, the unre-
  duced -kun/-kon follows the adjunctive -a which is absent with the reduced form
  -ko and in the past tense. These few sentences are insufficient to find any regular-
  ity. They indicate, however, that a process where the verb ‘to have’ was used as
  an aspect marker had presumably started not later than the 12‘ century in spoken
 Nobiin and was occasionally used by individuals in informal written communi-
 cation. Until the end of the documentation of Old Nobiin, it was, however, rarely
 used. Although nothing definitive can be deduced, the few examples point to kon-
 / kun-/ko- marking a ‘classical’ perfect aspect: It is the verb ‘to have’ that can be
 used with different tenses and as far as the contexts are undisputable a state re-
 sulting from an earlier event is expressed in each sentence.
     In Modern Nobiin the situation has changed. The element -kon/-ko is suffixed
 to a verb but only takes the past tense suffixes. The construction with adjunctive
 -a- is lost. The complex is rarely used in the affirmative, but has replaced the old
                                                                                   173
past in the negative (see chapters 6.2 & 9.1). The paradigms which the different
authors present are the following:
Lepsius (1880:88), Abel (1913:10)                                 Werner (1987)
IsG                  -kos                                         IsG                -koss

 IPL                 -kos, -kossu (Lepsius)                        IPL               -koss
2                    -kossokom                                    2                  -kossokom
3                    -kossan                                      3                  -kossaBetween Lepsius’s/Abel’s time and Werner’s research 3 person singular and
plural forms have been reduced. Lepsius’ 1st person plural suffix is more com-
plex than Abel’s. The latter might be a reduction as well as a dialectal variation.
Lepsius and Abel mix and confuse two rather different constructions—the one
discussed here with -kon/-ko, another one with -ken—which they regard as sim-
ple variations. The -ken construction, however, originates in a periphrastic con-
struction of Old Nobiin and marks a habitual as has been described in chap-
ter 9.4. Lepsius (1880:88) and Reinisch (1879:80) call -kon/-ko perfect markers.
Werner (1987:175ff.) fails to distinguish the formation from the preterit and
describes it as expressing an action which was completed in the past.
        In Abel’s Ermenne text are only two examples of an affirmative perfect:
    (Erm. 112)

    CONT-see-and    boy-OB)    very much        love-DIR-3SGPRET    ‘it has been so that the sultan having fathered seven girls, and the girl, the youngest daughter of the
    sultan, having seen the boy’s doing, and having seen it she loved the boy very much’    -kun is not marked for tense/person in this example, but as part of a verbal com-
    plex where only the last verb (doll-os-on) is marked as 3'4 person singular pret-
    erit. This is not quite typical for verbal complexes because the tense/aspect mark-
    ing of the last verb differs from the one of the other verbs. If we take a look at
    the meaning of the event told here it is rather obvious that the two verbs with
    -kun- refer to events prior to the one described by the last verb.
        In the next example, a verbal complex ends with -kon/-ko and is also marked
    as preterit. As the sentence is in direct speech, the chronological reference point
    is the time of speaking.","[171, 172, 173, 174]"
"The particle -is-, often reduced to -s-, may also take verbal suffixes, as in:
 is-sana (i. ¢. is-rana 3PLPREIND)              ‘whatever/whoever they are’
 s-ena (i.e. is-ena 3SGPRESIND)                 ‘is it...2?, what is...?’
s-il       (i, €. is-il PARTPRES)               ‘who is...?’ The last example is only documented in one of the personal letters of Qasr Ibrim
 (although there might be one arguable instance in the Stauros text; Zyhlarz
 1928:43) and seems to be evidence for the development to Modern Nobiin. In
 the more informal context of letters, we also find combinations of min-/men- and
 -is- which probably are evidence of a more colloquial variant of Old Nobiin:
 (IT 1123.1)
 made         56   min-is-ena
 millet            what-INTERROG-3SGPRESIND
 ‘what about the 56 (artabs of) millet?’ (IT II] 48.2)
 men-s-ena
 what-INTERROG-3SGPRESIND  ‘what is it?’  In Modern Nobiin, these complex forms are not present. The interrogative parti-
  cle -is-, however, is preserved in a form which has to be analyzed. The following
  formations can be found in the various texts and dictionaries:
  siddo                 (do ‘place’)                             ‘where?’
  sikkir                (kir ‘manner’)                           ‘how?’
  sille                 (INTERROGPART -lc ?)                     ‘who?’
  siddoton              (do ‘place’, -ton ‘from’)                ‘where from?’
  sikkeel               (keel ‘end, boundary, limit”)            ‘how long?, how big?’
  sillog                 (-log ‘with, by, through’)              ‘from where?’
 sin(n)                  (GEN marker -n)                         ‘whose?’
  60
It is evident from the geminated middle consonants of the interrogatives that it
can not be the simple particle -(j)s- which is preserved in Modern Nobiin. In-
stead, it seems to be Old Nobiin s-i/ ‘who is...?’, the interrogative particle
marked as present participle, which provided the basis for the modern forms. The
geminated consonants are the result of regular assimilation processes.
sil-do      >       siddo
sil-kir     >       sikkir
sil-keel    »       sikkeel
sil-n       -       sinnIn summary, it can be noted that in the system of pronouns no basic changes have
occurred. The loss of inclusive/exclusive distinction with the personal pronouns
is the most noticeable one. Reduction of plural marking at the demonstratives
corresponds to the general changes in nominal plural marking which took place
in the course of the development from Old to Modern Nobiin. Concerning the
interrogatives, some changes which finally led to the modern pronouns were
already observable in the Old Nobiin texts. To these belong the use of -m/(i)i
‘why’ and the development of s-i/ ‘who is...?’ combined with different postposi-
tional elements.","[60, 61]"

1. Introduction
 It is not often that we can observe language change in a language over a period
of more than one thousand years. Nobiin-Nubian seems to be the only language
belonging to the Nilo-Saharan phylum where this is possible. The present study
analyzes language change in Nobiin over a period of about a millennium. This
analysis is based on textual data from the older stage of Nobiin written in the
medieval period between the 8th and the 15th centuries, called Old Nobiin
throughout this book, as well as present-day Nobiin, as it is known through the
work of scholars from the nineteenth century onward until the latest grammatical
and lexical studies of Werner (1987) and Khalil (1996), called Modern Nobiin
here.
     A few introductory notes on terminology seem to be indicated at this point.
The Nobiin language was and is spoken in a region called Nubia. The geographi-
cal term, which will frequently be used in this study, comprises the area of As-
wan around the Ist Cataract in the north (see map) and the region around ed-
Debba between the 34 and 4th Cataracts in the south. This means that the north-
ernmost part of Nubia lies in the modern country of Egypt but the greatest part of
Nubia belongs to present-day Sudan. Traditionally, the region between the Ist and
2nd Cataracts was referred to as “Lower Nubia” and the region south of it as
“Upper Nubia”, with the Batn el-Hajar or kid-n-tu “Belly of Stones” as a stretch
of the Nile difficult to pass as a natural barrier in between the two divisions. The
construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s brought about dramatic
changes for the Nubian people and the region. People were relocated in regions
far from their original homes and great parts of Lower Nubia were flooded. At
the same time, the construction project led to the first collaborative international
rescue effort involving UNESCO. The so-called “Nubia Campaign” aimed at
salvaging the archaeological sites threatened by the Aswan High Dam. Most of
the Old Nobiin texts which served as a basis for the grammatical analyses in this
book were found in the course of several archaeological campaigns conducted
during the “Nubia Campaign”.
    Throughout this book, the chronological and historical category “medieval pe-
riod” is repeatedly used. “Medieval period” or “Middle Ages” usually designate
a period in European history mostly dated from the fall of the Western Roman
                                                                                          os nat adoro al
Empire in the 5% century until about the end of the 15th/early           16 century,
amongst other things marked by the beginning of European overseas expansion.
As part of the European historical periodization, the term “medieval period” and
the concept behind it cannot and should not easily and uncritically be transferred
and applied to the history of non-European regions. Early scholars of Nubian
languages and history used the designation “Christian Nubia” for the period after
the “fall” of the Meroitic Empire and a short “Dark Age” and before the final
Islamization of Nubia, i. e. between the 6th and the 14th/]5th centuries. As late as
2002, Welsby divides the history of Nubia along traditional terms as “Pagan”, a
term which is not only biased, but also pejorative, “Christian”, and “Muslim”.
This tripartition suggests that history happens in events at identifiable dates and
that religion is the defining factor for the periodization of history.
     In this book, the designation “medieval period” is mainly used for the era
 when Old Nobiin was a written language in Nubia. As the oldest document is
 dated to 787 and the youngest to 1484 this compasses a period of about 700
 years. In the appendix dealing with written sources, this period is expanded to
 nearly a millennium because it includes and critically assesses the work of Chris-
 tian historiographers on Nubia which starts as early as the 6th century. So it
 seems justified to talk about the Medieval Period or the Medieval Millennium
                                                                                             osises Sines
 without referring to religious categories or transferring European periodization to
 Nubia. Nubia had “its own” medieval period in history which was characterized
  by a highly organized kingdom interacting with its southern, eastern, western and
  northern neighbors—of different religious affiliation—and also with the Byzan-
  tine Empire outside the African continent.
      The older stage of the language analyzed in this study has been known as
  “Old Nubian” for about a century. Although it is still used by scholars of the
  various Nubian languages, this designation is not adequate and appears anti-
  quated, not the least because Nubian is the name of a language family consisting
  of different subgroups of languages not mutually intelligible. The language
  called “Old Nubian”, however, doesn’t represent an early stage of the whole
  language family but of only one of its members, the Nobiin language, which is
  moreover isolated within the family (Bechhaus-Gerst 1984/85, 1990, 1996). To
 call this language “Old Nubian” is at least as misleading as would be calling
 “Old English” “Old Germanic” which nobody would ever think of. One reason
 for the misleading designation lies in the history of Nubian studies. For a long
 time, only the Nubian languages spoken in the Nile Valley were known to Euro-
 pean scholars. They automatically assumed a closer genetic relationship between
 these “Nile Nubian” languages which only later turned out to be not the case.
 When the first pieces of medieval literature were discovered, the writing was
 deciphered and the linguistic affiliation was identified, it seemed natural to call it
 12
Old Nubian, although Griffith (1913:68) in the first comprehensive editing of the
then known texts remarked that “the agreement with the Fadija-Mahass dialect
 [= today’s Nobiin] as opposed to the Kenzi-Dongolese dialect is very clearly
marked”. It is recommended here that the term “Old Nubian” should be alto-
gether abandoned in favor of the more accurate “Old Nobiin”.
     The present study is not a work of linguistic theory but it also doesn’t restrict
 itself to mere descriptions of different language states. It tries to reveal processes
of language change and grammaticalization from Old to Moder Nobiin but also
within Old and Modern Nobiin respectively. Although the development and
changes in the nominal and pronominal systems are discussed, the focus was put
on the verbal morphology and syntax. Nevertheless, this book can only represent
the beginning of the study of language change in Nobiin. In 1991, the mentor of
Old Nobiin studies, the late G. Michael Browne, expressed what he regarded as
desiderata of future scholarly work. On top of his list he posted the need for a
diachronic grammar which would treat the relationship between Old and Modern
Nobiin but also diachronic patterns within Old Nobiin. This study hopefully is a
first step towards this end. As most of the work on Old Nobiin has been done by
classical scholars and the texts are available only in non-transcribed and non-
segmented form, the numerous examples from the texts may also serve to inter-
est scholars with different backgrounds for the interesting subject of language
change in Nobiin.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"3.3 PostpositionsOld Nobiin had a     rich inventory of postpositions only some of which are still
present or productive today. Postpositions followed the subjective or the genitive
depending on their origin and meaning. There are simple postpositions and com-
pound ones. Below, some of the postpositions of Old Nobiin are presented and
discussed with regard to their origin and change in their process of becoming
Modern Nobiin. For a full inventory of old and modern postpositions see the
respective grammars and dictionaries.
   Old Nobiin had a set of simple postpositions which usually followed a noun in
the subjective case. Sometimes an -(/)-element of indefinable origin and function
preceded these postpositions (Hintze 1975a:68; Browne 2002:67). Examples are:
Old Nobiin
-la (-Ila)     *(in)to, in, from’Because of the wide range of meanings of this postposition it is one of the most
common ones documented in the texts. It functioned as local, directional and
temporal postposition, as the examples below illustrate:

    A comparably wide range of meanings is found with the postposition -/o (-/lo)
‘in(to), in, from’ in Old Nobiin. -/o and -/a are quite similar in meaning and func-
tion so that a common origin is possible. Only -/o, however, functions as an
emphasizer in many contexts (see under Excurse 3). At times, the two postposi-
tions are used in identical contexts and seem to be interchangeable. It has to be
taken into consideration that the vowels a and o are often confused in Old Nobiin
and represent either dialectal variation or simply lack of precision on the part of
the scribes, as Browne (2002:15) proposed.
    In Modern Nobiin, we find -/o/-ro ‘in, from, out of? as equivalent. According
to Werner (1987:131), this postposition is almost extinct and only found as sec-
ond element in a complex noun + postposition. As postpositions usually follow
nouns his statement might imply that he only found lexicalized use. He gives the
example:
in-iin       ahar-ro                      ‘afterwards, thereafter, lastly’
this-GEN     end-inInterestingly, in the gospel according to Mark (e. g. 1.32) we find ahar-ra with
the postposition -/a suffixed to the noun instead. Lepsius and Abel do not list
-lo/-ro amongst the postpositions. What we do find in the Ermenne text is a com-
pound postposition -/o-tooni ‘from’ which will be discussed below. It can be
concluded that of the two postpositions -/a and -/o which overlapped in meaning
and function and were already interchangeable in Old Nobiin finally only -/a
survived as a productive element and that -/o was only preserved in a few lexi-
calized contexts. Both simple postpositions were used to construct more complex
ones (see below). In these cases, the overlapping of meaning and interchange-
ability of the two is also found.

examples are:                                                                                           39

the first part -id- (or assimilated -ir- or -in-) is difficult to determine. Abel simply
 ignores it and Lepsius wrongly interprets it as a genitive construction -in-do. -do
 is also found as second element of the interrogative pronoun -siddo ‘where’ and
 in adverbs indo ‘here (= this in)’ and mando ‘there (= ‘that in)’.
    The simple postpositions described above were attached to nouns to construct
 more complex ones. Examples are:

This compound                   postposition       represents a very          common     type of construction
consisting of a noun plus a simple postposition. In Old Nobiin, these two ele-
ments had already merged and were completely lexicalized. An independent
noun au ‘interior’ no longer existed. The non-contracted form appears in a sales
contract as well as in the formal Lectionary (101,5), so that both forms obviously
existed side by side for quite some time. Both of the two simple postpostions -/a
and -/o appear in the second postion behind the noun without any change in
meaning. In the Lectionary, we also find one instance where aua functions as an
adverb, but is actually attached to a genitive:
(Lect. 111.13-14)

manna-GEN             within      be-3SGPRES(?)“manna being(?) within’Interestingly, the form of the postposition ending with -o is restricted to one of
the texts discovered in Old Dongola. This, however, leads over to Modern No-
biin and the regular form

After or parallel to the merger and lexicalization of au ‘interior’ + -/a/-lo ‘in’ into
-(l)-au()a/-(1)-auo ‘within, into’ a second compound emerged which consisted of
the body part noun tu- with the literal meaning of ‘belly’ and a more metaphori-
cal one of ‘interior’, and the simple postposition -/a ‘in’. The noun was inde-
pendently used in Old Nobiin and is in fact still in use in the Modern variant.
Only very few examples of this compound postposition are found in the texts.
Contrary to -(1)-au(1)a/-(l)-auo, -tu-la followed the genitive so that we have a
regular possessor/possessed-construction:

‘(what) they ate and drank within the writing-office (?)’On the way to Modern Nobiin, a merger or fusion of -fu- and -/a occurred. In
Werner’s grammar (1987:138) a form, -twul, is given where the phonological
substance of the postposition—as happens so often in grammaticalization proc-
esses—is reduced by erosion. The final -a is lost and the simple postposition -/a
has disappeared as a phonological unit. But Werner also lists the unreduced form
-tuula which is found in the Ermenne text. Lepsius (1880:401) lists the two vari-
 ants side by side. The postposition still follows the genitive. The noun -tu ‘belly,
 inside’ is also used independently in Modern Nobiin. Examples are:
 (Erm. 36)

      -tauo                                         ‘below, under’      looks like it was constructed in a similar way as -auo ‘within, into’ above. A
      noun with the meaning of ‘underside’ is not documented in Old Nobiin and was
      possibly already lost. -tauo is often found in toponyms (see chapter 13.10). In
      Modern Nobiin, -sawwo ‘lower side, underside, under, below’ can function as a
      postposition when attached to a genitive and as an independent noun. An exam-
      ple for its modern usage is
      (GM 7,28)

      he __ below-his-at          Sit-3SGPRET      ‘he sat below him’ lit.: ‘he sat at his underside/below’      Contrary to Werner (1987:36ff.), it is assumed here that the use of awwo and
      tawwo as nouns             is the result of a re-interpretation of a former postpositional
      phrase.
          A different origin and development can be assumed for modern -dooro ‘upper
      side, above, against, because of’ and -gasko ‘center, mid, amidst’ both function-
      ing as postpositions following genitives. Although -dooro is also found in place
      names, its origin is difficult to determine. In one Old Nobiin passage we find:
      (IT I, 4 ii 26)
      lesusi     map-an_   tri-ka           dolle       _polg-ara           [pessna]

      more plausible derivation would be an origin in the verb dodul- ‘be high’
      (Browne 1996:49) which consists of -do ‘upon’ (see above) as adverb and the
      verb -dul ‘be, be located’. As there are other instances of a change from Old
EEE
                                                                                                                  43
Nobiin -d- to Modern Nobiin -r- this is highly probable. The verb doduI- is e. g.
documented in
(IT 11.13 ii. 17)
nodu      dodul                         ‘the high Lord’
god       be(ing) high(ITH 12 ii 7)
dodul-o       du-n                      ‘who is on high’
be high-on be-3SGPRET
Modern -dooro might well be a contracted form of -dodulo. An example for its
use in Modern Nobiin is
(GM 6,48)
aman-dooro          tapp-a-juu-on
water-above         walk-ADJ-g0-3SGPRET
‘he walking on the water”Modern -gasko ‘center, mid, amidst’ also appears to be a compound with former
-lo suffixed to a noun. In Old Nobiin, however, we find the compound gasknau-
la ‘in the midst’ which follows the genitive as does its modern equivalent.
Gasknau-la itself is a genitive construction consisting of a noun gask- with un-
known meaning, genitival -n and the compound postposition -au-/a ‘within, into’
 described above. If we assume gask- denoted something like ‘centre’ or ‘mid’,
 the literal meaning of the compound would have been ‘in the interior of the cen-
 ter’. Through several processes of fusion, assimilation and loss the modern form
 -gasko emerged.
    Some other postpositions are worthy of discussion here. A few of them are
 only documented in a few or even isolated instances. To the latter belongs
 Old Nobiin
 -mol                                    “close to, nearness’ which       follows the genitive and therefore represents an original possessive
 phrase. The only example seems to be
 (IT I1 23. 7-8)
 sulwi      kroda-m-mol         do-en                     ‘if you come near/close to the Sulwi Kroda’
 Sulwi      Kroda-GEN-near      come-PARTCOND In Modem Nobiin, we find a noun -mo(o)/ ‘nearness, proximity, neighbour’
 which, however, takes the simple postposition -/a to function as the compound
 postposition -mo/(o)i(I)a ‘close to, nearby’ which follows the genitive (the suffix
 of which may be deleted).

        what happened. It seems that in Old Nobiin -mol was a noun which expressed a
        locational relationship in a possessive construction. Like every other noun too,
        -mol could take various postpositions, examples of which are found in Modern
        Nobiin, e. g. in the gospel according to Mark:
        (GM 4,1)
        aadem_    kaamil    barri-laa   aman     mool-laa          aag-ji-san

        ‘and he intended to pass by them (lit.: by their neamess)’        Contrary to -tul above, the construction -mo/ + postposition is fully productive
        and neither fusion nor reduction have yet taken place.
           Werner lists another compound postposition, -faala ‘outside of’ following the
        genitive and derives it from a hypothetical noun *faa ‘outside’ and the postposi-
        tion -/a. He also cites a noun faado ‘outside’ with the same presumed nominal
        basis. The Ermenne narrative has one example of an adverbial use of faado in the
        phrase faado fal- ‘go outside’ (1913:37).                  Lepsius’ gospel only has faado too.
        -faala is not mentioned by the two authors. There is one instance of a similar
————E
        adverb in the Ibrim texts:
        (IT 111 49 ii 3)

        postposition -/o. The nouns doesn’t seem to be documented in Old Nobiin unless
        it is related to fa(ajl- ‘door, gate’, an equation which might be a little farfetched.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

The conditional of Old Nobiin is formed with the suffix -ko- or his variant -ka-
                                                                                                         a
and is built upon the subjunctive. The reduced participle is followed by -ko- (or
-ka-), the subjunctive formant is suffixed. In most instances, -/o is added which
                                                                                                         a
according to Browne (1997:21—24) is not the emphatic marker, but the locative.
With -/o initial -/ is often elided or assimilated (Browne 1987:27). If the subject
of protasis and apodosis is identical and unambiguously identifiable -ko-/-ka- is
directly followed by -/o. Otherwise, person and number are marked before -/o.
The following paradigm emerges:
                                                                                                                  ee

                                                                                                         ~ pen
Although -kan(no) marks the 3"" person singular it alternates with -en, a form
unmarked for person and number, in the texts. At the same time, enkan alternates
with en.
   Evidence that it actually is the participle which is found in the conditional is
given in the first example from a letter in which participle and conditional
marker are separated by an adverb:
(IT HI 58.10)
alesin   ikka_peff-il               wel-kon           anni-gil    karte     _pa-eso
truely   you judge-PART             again-3SGCOND     me-to       letter    write-IMPERSG
‘truly if he judges you again, write a letter to me’Often, the protasis is additionally marked by a/esin ‘truly’, as it is the case in the
next example from the Miracle of St. Menas:
(M. 4.16-5.4)
alesin   nod-il        aika        muduu-konno      filoxenith-gille-lo     —_ju-re
truly    god-SUBJ      me          guide-3SGCOND    Philoxenite-to-EMPH     go-1SGPRESIND‘truly, if the Lord guides me, I am going to Philoxenite’                                                                                                   105
The next example also comes from a personal letter. The protasis has the endings
of the conditional including assimilated -/o followed by identical emphasizer -lo
and the apodosis is in the imperative:
(IT III 51.7-8)
tri-mon-kaanno-lo        taanna                _asti-tot-ina      gr-eso
give-reject-3PLCOND-EMPH her-GEN               daughter-young-GEN cause to be-IMPERSG
‘if they reject to give, cause (them) to be her young daughter’s’In the next sentence from the Nicene Canons, we find the endings of the condi-
tional followed by the negative verb men- and again including assimilated -/o. In
this instance, however, we find the subjunctive in the apodosis.
(NC 20.2-3)
iereos-il-lon        wek-ka         —_uis-ka           tir-men-kanno        tan ail-la_—_ pes-en

 found in Modern Nobiin and will be presented below. In the sentence from a
 personal letter, the shorter ending of the conditional is followed by the impera-
 tive in the apodosis:
 (IT Ill 51.6-7)
 elok           kotin tanni-ka_tik-kauan-de               pal-a            jour-eeso
 and now        EMPH of her-OBJ give-3PLCOND-and          come forth-AD)   go-IMPERSG
 ‘and now, if they give (them) to her (agent), come forth’ Short forms are also documented in the following examples from the Nicene
 Canons:
  (NC 20.1)
  orpa_ en-kan              elle  en-kan
  wine be-3SGCOND           wheat be-3SGCOND
  ‘if it is wine, if it is wheat’  In Modern Nobiin, a further development of the old conditional is found in one
  of the paradigms presented by Werner (1987:161). The paradigm is evidently
  based on the variant form with -ka-. The plural forms documented by Lepsius
  (1880:11), Reinisch (1879:84) and Abel (1913:14) which represent an earlier
  form of Modern Nobiin are even more similar to their Old Nobiin predecessors.","[104, 105, 106]"

3.4 Formation of NounsOld Nobiin had a rich inventory of noun formation suffixes some of which will
be presented and discussed below. Of interest will be those still found in Modern
Nobiin either as productive elements or lexicalized.
   A well documented suffix forming abstract and concrete nouns from verbs is
-at(t)-      as in
tapp-att-            ‘destruction’      from    tapir-        ‘to destroy’
seu-att-             ‘heir’             from    seu-          ‘to inherit’The element is preserved as -afti in Modern              Nobiin. According to Werner
 (1987:91) and Lepsius (1880:29), -atti marks a person, but has a negative conno-
 tation in most of the cases, as in
 banp-atti           *babbler’          from    banp-         ‘to speak’
 di-atti             ‘murderer’         from    di-           ‘to die’
 mark-atti           ‘thief?            from    mark-         ‘to steal, to rob’The negative connotation doesn’t correspond to the Old Nobiin examples. There,
however, we find the denominative and deverbative agent formant -katti which
 produces comparable nouns, such as48
uk-katt-/ur-katt-       ‘oppressor, enemy’       from      ur           “to (op)press’”
nape-katt               ‘sinner’                 from     nape          ‘sin’The last example is also listed by Lepsius (1880:367) as
nabce-gatti             ‘sinner’Another similar derivation with a negative connotation in Modern Nobiin is
marja-gatti             ‘liar’                   from      marja        ‘lie, wrong’Old Nobiin -Xatt- is not restricted to pejorative contexts as other examples show.
The same holds true for Modern Nobiin. Both Lepsius and Wemer noted words
ending in -atti in the vocabularies which do not fall in this semantic category, but
are not accounted for. Examples are
fag-atti                ‘half?                   from      fag-         ‘to divide’
till-atti               ‘sweat’                  from      till-        ‘to sweat”
unn-atti                ‘progeny’                from      unn-         ‘to bear, to give birth to”Old Nobiin pak-katt- ‘share, half? from pag- ‘to share’ shows that an original
-katti might have been reduced in these examples. unnatti is not documented in
Old Nobiin, and (ilatti is only found in a doubtful instance in IT III 39.24 where
Browne (1996:171) tentatively translates ‘bosom’.
   To further complicate the situation unnee-gatti ‘wise man’ from unnee ‘under-
Standing, thoughts’ has to be cited which was documented by Lepsius
(1880:406).           This de-nominal        derivation   corresponds   to Old      Nobiin     une-katt-
‘wise’ from une- ‘understanding’. There is no evidence that -gatti is productive
in Modern Nobiin and seems to be present only in lexicalized from.
    Another suffix in the context of word formation which is present in Old No-
biin and still productive in the modern variant is the denominative and deverbal
abstract noun formant
-itt-         as in
aru-itt-                ‘irrigation’             from     aru-          ‘rain’
iskel-itt-              “request, prayer’        from     iskel-        “to beg’Werner (1987:87) lists ewitti- ‘field work’, fayitti ‘scripture’, and uwitti ‘second’
as examples for the productive suffix in Modern Nobiin. The last two are inter-
esting because the corresponding words in Old Nobiin look quite different. Mod-
ern Nobiin faay- ‘to write’ corresponds to Old Nobiin par-. The phonological
changes are regular ones. Instead of the deverbal noun *paritti- ‘scripture’, how-
ever, pa(a)rt- and pait- ‘scripture, writing’ are found in the Old Nobiin texts. Of
quite a different nature is the example of wwitti ‘second’ from uwwo ‘two’. In
Modern Nobiin, ordinals are regularly formed by suffixing -itti to the cardinals.
The only exception is wrragi ‘beginning, initially’ which is used as ordinal ‘first’
                                                                                                      49
instead of *weeritti from weer- ‘one’. Only some of the ordinals are preserved in
the old texts but we find formations with -ift(i) for ‘3d’ tuskit(t)-, ‘4’ kemsit()-
and ‘7th’ kolotit-. The corresponding number ww(wo) ‘two’ is present, but the
ordinal documented is wil- ‘second’. Only in one text, IT 1 11, we find circum-
stantial evidence for the existence of another form. In line 9, the ordinal ‘12!’ is
part of the expression dimedu witinin ‘it being the twelfth’. witi- corresponds to
modern wwitti ‘second’. In line 8 of the same text, wif- seems to be part of a
compound noun ‘two small feasts’. As these examples are singular the evidence
is not conclusive. The most convincing explanation of present-day uwitti- is as a
formation analogous to the other ordinals.
    A suffix which forms abstract nouns from verbs and nouns is
-k(i)-       as in
it-k-                  ‘mankind’               from   it-         ‘man’
tur-k                  ‘setting’               from   tor-        ‘to enter’-k(i)- is neither discussed nor recognized by Werner (1987) or Lepsius (1880).
 Lepsius’ Nobiin vocabulary, however, includes derivation as jag-ki ‘fear’ from
jag ‘to fear’, and Khalil (1990) also records a number of formations with the
suffix -k(i)-, as e. g.
afri-ki              ‘beauty’                  from   afri-       “beautiful”
gak-ki               ‘gap, crack, cleft’       from   gak-        ‘to rip, to crack, to break’
abinti-ki            ‘benignity, placidness’   from   abint       “benign, gentle, soft’Into the same category of abstract formation falls the suffix -kane- as in
aigajkane-             ‘exultation’            from   ai(l)gaj-   “to exult”
aiokkane-              ‘grudging*              from   aiol-       ‘to be grudging”
                                                                  (with assimilation of -l-)In ChN 6.20, one instance with geminated nasal is found
aik-kann-              ‘spirituality’          from   ail-        ‘heart, soul’Lepsius (1880:28ff.) describes a presumably corresponding suffix -kennee which
forms abstract nouns from verbs, nouns and adjectives, as in
assar-kennee            ‘childhood’            from   assar       ‘small, child’
mas-kennee              ‘the good’             from    mas        ‘good’
uus-kennee              ‘misdoing’             from    uus-       ‘bad, evil’
ed-kennee               ‘wedding’              from    ed-        “to take, to marry’The suffix -it is a general noun formant both from verbs and nouns. Although
Zyhlarz (1928:21) listed an -it suffix, he did not succeed in determining the ver-
bal origin of his examples. In his earlier works, Browne did not recognize the
50
       derivational morpheme. It is in the Qasr Ibrim texts that most of the nouns are
       found (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996:229). Examples are
       tisk-it          ‘destruction’           from   tisk-          ‘to destroy’
       unn-it           ‘birth’                 from   unn-           ‘to bear, to give birth’
       pisteu-it        ‘belicf”                from   pisteu-        ‘to believe’
       doll-it          ‘wish, desire’          from   doll-          ‘to wish’
       od-it            ‘illness’               from   od(d)-         ‘to be sick’
       tei-it           ‘hope’                  from   tei-           ‘to hope’
       kap-it           ‘loaf (of bread)’       from   kap-           “to eat’
       kit-it           “garment”               from   kit(ir)-       ‘to dress’       In one Old Nobiin text, Chrisostomus Nubianus, the derivation
       ag-id            ‘seat’                  from   ag-            ‘to sit’       is documented. This leads over to Modern Nobiin where the corresponding -iid/
       -id is the most productive suffix used to derive verbal nouns from all kinds of
       verbs. Examples can be found in Werner (1987:202) and Lepsius (1880:28).
       Khalil documents (1996:57) kap-id ‘round, thick loaf of bread’ which directly
       corresponds to Old Nobiin kap-it (see above).
          This unquestionable correspondence makes Browne’s (2002:27) equation of
       the suffixes -it and -t highly improbable. Old Nobiin -f- is another deverbal and
       denominal noun formant which is documented in examples as
       iar-t            ‘knowledge’             from   iar-           ‘to know’
       gut-t            ‘shame’                 from   gur-           ‘to be shameful’
                                                                      (with assimilation)
       dumart-          ‘power’                 from   dum(m)ar-      ‘to rule over, hold’       The modern correspondence is the suffix -¢i, Nouns with final -ti are frequent in
       present-day Nobiin        but it doesn’t seem to be a productive derivational suffix.
       Examples are
       nur-ti           ‘flour’                 from   nuur        ‘to thresh, to grind’
       jor-ti           ‘oath’                  from   jor         *to swear’       The suffix -; is presumably an allomorph of -é- after d, n, j, and yl, as Browne
       (2002:27) has pointed out. He cites the examples
       sonoj-j-         ‘office of the sonoj’
       an-j-       ;    ‘life, savior’          from   an-               ‘to live’       The last example is also listed by Khalil (1990:113) for Modern Nobiin:
       aan-ji           ‘life’                  from   an-             ‘to live’       Another suffix which forms abstract nouns from verbs and nouns is

and -ee with a long vowel. The latter is most probably a loan from Kenzi (Wer-
ner 1987:81). Examples from derivate nouns with short vowel -e are, e. g.
gug-e             ‘flatulence,        from       gug-          ‘to swell, to bloat’

 of language change. These formants will not be discussed here.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"

2.4 Modern Nobiin and the Nubian Language FamilySeveral times now, the Dongolese/Kenzi language has been mentioned besides
Nobiin and a few notes concerning their relationship seem to be appropriate.
   At least since the beginning of the 20th century, it has been claimed that a ge-
netically defined Nubian language family consisting of a Nile Nubian and a Hill
(Kordofanian) Nubian subgroup, Birgid (spoken in Southern Darfur and now
extinct) and Midob (in Northern Darfur) exists. Attempts at classification for a
long time focused on the languages of the so-called Nile Nubian branch which
 were known to the European linguistic community much longer than other Nu-
 bian languages. The group was divided into the Mahas/Fadijja language on the
 one side, and the Dongolese/Kenzi language on the other side. For the Ma-
 has/Fadijja continuum, Bell introduced the self-designation Nobiin in 1974. The
 initially implicit assumption that the geographically adjacent Nubian languages
 of the Nile valley were also more closely related genetically became explicit in
 the discussion of the homeland of the Nubians. Basically, two alternatives were
 proposed: Either the Darfur and Hill Nubians were fugitives from the Nile Valley
 or the Nile Nubians migrated from an original homeland somewhere in the west
  of the Nile. The problem of the homeland was solved more than twenty years
  ago (Behrens 1981, Thelwall 1982, Bechhaus-Gerst 1984/85) and will not be
  discussed here. More importantly, however, it was also shown that geographic
  adjacency of languages and their speakers does not necessarily imply a particu-
  larly close genetic relationship. In the course of several studies (Bechhaus-Gerst
   1984/85, 1989, 1996), it could be proven that speakers of the different Nubian
  languages of the Nile Valley undoubtedly reached the region at a time interval of
  more than 1500 years. The first arrivals were the predecessors of the Nobiin at
  about 1500 BC, followed by the early Dongolese/Kenzi at the beginning of the
 Common Era. It could furthermore be shown that a genetically defined Nile Nu-
 bian group never existed, but that the close relationship between the modern lan-
 guages was caused by intensive language contact. The Nobiin language in fact
 constitutes an isolated branch of the Nubian language family, whereas the Dongo-
 22
lese/Kenzi language is genetically closely related to the Hill Nubian languages of
Kordofan. Nobiin and Dongolese/Kenzi were and are not mutually intelligible.
    Additional remarks concerning the term Dongolese/Kenzi seem to be re-
quired. Dongolese and Kenzi are closely related languages which can be classi-
fied as dialects, although they were and are not spoken in adjacent regions. Don-
golese is spoken to the south and Kenzi to the north of the Nobiin speech area.
This is a relatively recent development. It is known from written sources that the
Kenzi dialect came into being in the course of the 13th and 14th centuries when
the Arab Beni Kanz became the Nubian Kenzi through intermarriage with Nubi-
ans from Dongola, as a result of which language shift from Arabic to Nubian
took place. This variant of Dongolese, spoken by the Beni Kanz developed into
what is known as the Kenzi language.
    This book deals with language change in Nobiin but it doesn’t actually discuss
the reasons for the different kinds of change. Although in each case presented
below arguments for an internal development might be found, much of what will
be analyzed must be regarded as a result of the language contact addressed
above. The sociolinguistic setting and its consequences have been studied in
detail in Bechhaus-Gerst (1996) and need not be repeated here. At this point,
however, it should be noted that the Nobiin language underwent significant
changes which for the most part can be traced back to a long-term and intensive
contact with speakers of Dongolese/Kenzi and presumably Arabic and Beja
speakers who either learnt Nobiin as second language or shifted to Nobiin as
their first language. The consequences of this process were classified as “‘inter-
ference through shift” (see e. g. Thomason & Kaufman 1988) which results from
imperfect learning during a process of language acquisition. Speakers shifting to
a so-called target language “‘fail” to learn the new language perfectly, but keep
some of the features of their original language or continue to make “mistakes”
when using the new language. These features or “mistakes” may even spread to
the target language when they are imitated by speakers of that language. Thomas
& Kaufmann (ibid., 39) point out that interference through shift begins with
sound and syntax and may even include morphology before words of the original
language appear in the target language.
    Because of its status as a quasi-official language in medieval Nubia, Old No-
biin doubtlessly represented a target language for speakers of other languages of
the Nubian Nile Valley and its hinterland. Social and economic mobility was
presumably dependent on linguistic skills including a certain competence in Old
Nobiin. This situation only changed when Old Nobiin lost its prestigious position
to Arabic, a process which started in the 13th century, but was not completed until
the end of the 15th century when Old Nobiin was no longer employed in writing.","[22, 23]"

4, Pronouns
4.1 Personal PronounsThe following pronouns function as the subject of a clause. In Old Nobiin, the
so-called juncture vowel -u- could be suffixed. For the 1st person plural, Old
Nobiin had a distinction between inclusive and exclusive. This distinction is lost
in Modem       Nobiin which only retained the former exclusive -u-. Otherwise, the
subject pronouns remained unchanged.
                 Old Nobiin       Modern Nobiin
Isc              ai               ai
2                ir               ir

3                ter              terIn Modern Nobiin, there is, however, a second set of subject pronouns character-
ized by an additional -i/-ii suffix (Lepsius 1880:56) which according to Werner
(1987:116) is marked by high tone.
 IsG             ayii             PL            uuii
2                irii                           urii
3                tarii                          teriiWerner presumed that the suffix might be an eroded remnant of the Old Nobiin
case marker -i/. As, however, the subject pronouns are not marked for case in Old
Nobiin this is highly improbable. A semantic difference between the two sets is
not indicated by the texts. It seems possible that the -i/-ii suffix is a former junc-
ture vowel. As has been described above we find an annective -u or -i between
elements which closely cohere. This can be the case with appositions and attribu-
tives but it also optionally binds postpositions to the preceding nouns or phrases
and pronouns to the rest of the sentences. Although most examples show the
vowel -u, -i can occasionally be found:                                                                                   53
(IT1412)
it-i   inno        — douar[aJenkan
you        there     be-COND‘if you had been there’Personal pronouns with suffixed juncture vowels -u or -i are rather widespread in
Old Nobiin texts so that the modern paradigm might go back to Old Nobiin pro-
nouns plus juncture vowel. Browne (1991:288) has, however, pointed out that
even in Old Nobiin, the juncture vowel is more often missing than present and
that the unmotivated changes between -u and -i may actually indicate some sort
of neutral vowel, such as a. Here, we find two counter-arguments against the
proposed origin of the second set of modern subject pronouns.
        If Abel’s translation can be trusted some sort of emphatic connotation can still
be deducted for Modern Nobiin, as in the following example:
(Erm. 78)
ir-i   kutt-a              kumbuu-n-gifir          malick-ka__dett-a             gammi-kac-c-a

bed-one-OB)    make bed-DIR-PRED             bed-into           egg-GEN-shell-OBJ | put-PLOBJ-PRED
“you get up, collect all egg shells, gather them, make a bed, and into the bed put the egg shells’In other examples the emphatic connotation is more difficult to trace:
(Erm. 80)
kumbuu-n-gifiri          kafu-kik-ani      ter-i      —ik-ka      fa-issig-inan-ani
egg-GEN-shell            crackle-COND      they       you-OBJ      FUT-ask-3PpL-then (PART)
 ‘if the egg shells crackle, they will ask you’ In conclusion one has to state that the origin of the -i/-ii suffix remains obscure.
    The object of the personal pronoun is marked by the suffix Old Nobiin -ka;
 Modern Nobiin -ga(/-ka) which is the regular nominal case suffix. As can be
 seen below, various rules of assimilation produce the actual paradigms. The
 Modern Nobiin object suffix is -ga as 1st person singular and plural shows. Al-
 though in Modern Nobiin the regular assimilation rule produces /r/ + /g/ > /rl’
 (Werner 1987:41), the Old Nobiin geminated consonants are preserved which are
 the result of the very common Old Nobiin regressive assimilation r + k —> kk.

4.2 Genitive and Possessive PronounsOld Nobiin has two sets of possessive pronouns which are identical to the geni-
tive of the personal pronouns (see Chapter 3.2.1 on nominal case marking). The
genitive markers -(i)n or -na are suffixed to the personal pronouns and assimila-
tion rules operate. The possessive pronoun stands before its noun:
                    Old Nobiin
IsG                 an, anna                IPL excl.   un, unna
                                                incl.   en, enna
2                   in, inna                2           un, unna
3                   tan, tanna              3           ten, tennaThe difference between the two sets is not easy to determine. The longer forms
are predicatives by origin (GEN -m + PRED -a). In many examples, the shorter -n
forms can be regarded as simple possessives whereas the others can be described
as objective genitives or as dependent upon a noun in the predicative or the sub-
ject of a verbal noun, e. g.
(M. 12.2-3)
in      tanna_   kip-sil
this   his       eat-PARTPRETII
‘this which he ate’ = lit.: ‘this his having eaten’In many phrases, however, the distinction seems to be blurred and it can be con-
cluded that it already was under way to disappear at the Old Nobiin stage docu-
mented by the written texts.
   The two sets of possessives represent the Old Nobiin standard. Fortunately,
unassimilated forms are preserved mostly in translation of parts of the Old Tes-
tament. These show more archaic forms than the bulk of texts:
2sG                irin           (Browne 1987:77)
3sG                tarin          (IT 12120)
3PL                terin          (Browne 1987:87)A third set of possessives is found, for example, in the letters from Qasr Ibrim
but is notably absent in nearly all the religious-theological texts. Zyhlarz pro-                                                                               55
posed that these pronouns were only present, when the possessive is independent
or used as apposition to its noun. The forms found in letters from Qasr Ibrim are:
1sG                anni          (IT III 52.5, Browne 1984:55)
2sG                inni          (IT HI, 26.1; IT Hl. 5717)
3sG                 tanni        (IT III, 51.4,6)
IPL                 enni         (Browne, ibid.)These possessives follow the noun and represent a late development of Old No-
biin which leads over to Modern Nobiin. Their constructions correspond to no-
minalized attributives where genitival -n is suffixed to an adverb or postposi-
tional phrase. In the few Old Nobiin examples, we find postpositions attached to
the pronouns, as e. g. in anni-kille ‘to me’ (lit.: ‘to of mine’, IT III 52.5) or anni-
ka ‘me’ (lit.: ‘that of mine’, St. 10.10-11).
   According to Werner (1987:117ff.), Modern Nobiin has three sets of posses-
sive pronouns. The first one is identical to the genitive of the innovated subject
pronouns with suffixed -i/-ii.
 IsG                ayiin                   IPL             uuiin
2                   iriin                   2               uriin
3                   tariin                  3               teriinThese pronouns precede the noun, phrase or sentence they are dependent on. In
the sentences collected by Werner, however, as well as in the large Ermenne text,
preceding possessives are restricted to kinship terminology (see below). Only in
Lepsius’ conservative translation of the Gospel according to Marc, we find ex-
 amples for preceding possessives in constructions such as:
 (GM 8,19)
 aiyiin        kaba_ = dija__birti-sin-laa
 IsGposs       bread   five break-PARTPRETII-in
    ‘in my having broken five breads”        “he second set is identical to the classical Old Nobiin paradigm   (see above)
    minus the 1st person plural inclusive form:
     IsG             an                         IPL          uun
    2                 in                        2            unn
    3                tan                        3            tenn    These pronouns follow their noun as do the innovated ones of the third set:
    IsG               anni                      IPL          uuni
    2                 inni                      2            unni
    3                 tanni                     3            tenni
    56
In kinship terminology, which is rarely used without possessives, Modern Nobiin
preserves an archaic paradigm with prefixed pronouns:
              Old Nobiin               Modern Nobiin
IsG           apol                     aboo            ‘my father’
2             ipol                     iboo            ete.
3             tappapil                 taffaabTPL           en papi(l) (incl.)
              oun papil (excl.)        uuffaab
2             *ouppapil (unattested)   —_uffaab
3             *teppapil (unattested)   teffaabThe first and second persons singular are irregular and fossilized forms. Final -/
may frequently vanish in Old Nobiin as in a sales contract (IT III 40.33) where
we find en papi ‘our father’. In Modern Nobiin, final -/ has completely disap-
peared. The phonological changes are regular. In IT III 35, we find one instance
of an irregular an papil instead of apol ‘my father’. This could be a title, as
Browne (1991:86) suggested but also an analogous construction by a scribe with
a first language different from Old Nobiin.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"
"
10.6 The New Habitual/ImperfectiveIt will be shown that the verb -ak-/-a(a)g- with the original meaning of ‘sit, re-
main, stay’ had entered into a process of grammaticalization in Old Nobiin as
second verb of a verbal complex which resulted in a durative in the modern lan-
guage. Not many examples for the beginning of this development, however,
could be found in Old Nobiin. The same holds true for -ak-/-a(a)g- as first verb
in a complex.
   As the -ke-/-ki-/-k- periphrastics were generalized from the special function of
marking the habitual to a general imperfective, the need may have arisen to find
new ways of expressing habitual action. As we know from Modem Nobiin, this
has actually happened. The a(ag)- complex seems to have filled the gap left by                                                                                              163
the original habitual. a(ag)- is one of only two verbs which were grammatical-
ized as first elements in a complex.                                      ;
   In almost all of the classical religious texts, ak- is only documented in the
function of a simple verb. In Lectionary 111,3, however, we find the following
sentence:
(Lec. 111,3)
palyei] [r iin Jil-appa ak-dak-tak-ara[sin]
shrine-SUBJ-for         sit-be covered-PASS-PERFPREDPART-(for)‘For the [first] tabernacle was set up.’Here, ak- ‘sit’ is used in a verbal complex preceding another verb tak- “be cov-
ered’. The complex is ambivalent and can be understood in two ways. Browne
(1996:8) lists ak-dak- as a compound with the new meaning of ‘set up’ (‘sit,
remain’ + ‘be covered’). This new meaning is mainly derived from the Greek
 Vorlage of the Nubian text which is Hebr. 9.2, where the setting up of the taber-
nacle is described. The second possible interpretation derives from just this con-
tent. The text talks about the traditional way of sacrifice of the old religion. Ha-
bitually, the tabernacle or tent was set up in which the lampstand, the table and
the loaves were of display. From the whole context, a translation of dak- as
 ‘cover up’ is plausible. Then, ak- could be ascribed the function of marking a
 habitual action.
    A second and undisputable example is documented in a part of a psalm docu-
 mented in the Qasr Ibrim texts:
 (ITH, 13 ii, 20-23)
 ak-oup-ar-ra-sin            kiptou-gu-ka_     ou-gille on’
 Sit-fall-CAUS-PRED-EMPH people-PL-OBJ we-(in)to and
 sippi-gu-k       on oun’    oei-n         tri-ltauo
 nation-PL-OBJ    andour     foot-GEN      pair-under ‘He has overturned peoples for us and nations also under our feet.’ In this example, ak- preceding the causative ‘cause to fall’ can be interpreted as
 marking a habitual action. The quotation talks about God and what God ‘habitu-
 ally’ does for his chosen people.
     These few examples do not allow drawing any substantial conclusions con-
 cerning the grammaticalization of ag- in Old Nobiin. It can be said that it goes
 back to a verbal complex with ag- as the first element. The literal meaning of the
 example from Qasr Ibrim would be ‘he causes to overturn sitting’ or ‘he causes
 to overturn and sits’, ‘sitting’, however, being desemanticized and developing in-
 to a function word.","[163, 164]"

 13.4 The Kingdom of DotawoAs has been mentioned above, a Lower Nubian kingdom existed until the end of
the 15th century which was called Dotawo. At the beginning, scientific research
proceeded on the assumption that Dotawo was a kind of successor state founded
after the Arab occupation of Dongola. The written evidence found at Qasr Ibrim,
however, documents the name Dotawo in a royal proclamation as early as 1156
(Browne 1991:3). Other references date from the 12t to the 14th centuries, and
after a gap of more than one hundred years, the final reference mentions a king
of Dotawo in 1464 (Plumley 1978). Against this background, it seems remark-
able that the Arab writers not once mention Dotawo in their accounts of Nubian
history.
    This lack of written evidence gave cause for different speculations concerning
the position and significance of Dotawo in the context of Medieval Nubia. The
discussion concentrated on two rather different assumptions:
 1. Dotawo was a petty kingdom within Nobatia but was subordinate to dominat-
   ing Makuria.
2. Dotawo is the Nubian name for the kingdom of Makuria mentioned in Arab
   sources,
On the basis of the written sources, it can be stated that Dotawo’s main language
was Old Nobiin. The name itself has been interpreted as consisting of a toponym
Do and the postposition fawo ‘below’. Do was equated with modern Adda and
Daw of Arab sources. Thus, Dotawo is supposed to mean ‘(the country) below
Do’ (Adams 1977:535; Vantini 1981:199). This etymology is based on the as-
sumptions that Dotawo’s status actually was one of a petty kingdom and that its
capital was Adda. Sudanese archaeologist Ali Osman (1982:194) proposed an
alternative etymology of the name. He interprets it as a compound noun consist-
ing of doro ‘above (= south)’ and tawo ‘below (= north)’ and equates Dotawo
with Makuria and Nobatia/Makuria of Arab sources respectively.
   The discussion about the identity of Dotawo is exemplary for the sometimes
uncritical approach to historical sources concerning Nubia. Although historians
like Adams noticed the discrepancies in the sources of different origin no conclu-
sion was drawn, obviously because alternative interpretations would not have
fitted the traditional reconstruction of historical processes.
  One important argument for the equation of Dotawo and Makuria lies in the
fact that the two designations are never mentioned together in one text and Ma-
kuria is only mentioned once within the whole corpus of Old Nobiin Qasr Ibrim
texts. In contrast, Dotawo is not mentioned once in more than 120 Arabic sources                                                                               227
about medieval Nubia (Adams       1991:259). Although Adams    (1996:244) recog-
nizes this astonishing fact he continues to point out that the Qasr Ibrim docu-
ments contain as much evidence for as against the equation of Dotawo and Ma-
kuria.
    It has become quite obvious that Nobiin and Arabic names for places as well
as political entities often do not coincide. Only recently, it has been recognized
that Nobadia/Nobatia was called mig- or migitin gul- (gul- ‘territory’) in Old
Nobiin. The Arabic designation /brim is documented in the Coptic variant Phrim
and Greek Primis. But the Old Nobiin name for the place is Silimi which might
go back to Meroitic.
    The main argument presented against an equation of Dotawo and Makuria is
based on the names of the kings given in the texts. Between 1155 and 1191,
Moses George, George     Moses,   Moses and George are mentioned      as kings of
Dotawo in Nubian sources. It is dubious whether these names refer to one or
more persons. At the same time, George and Moses are known as kings in Don-
gola (Adams 1991, 1996; Vantini 1975). At first sight, this argues for the equa-
tion of Dotawo and Makuria. A hundred years later, however, Piarl (or Paul),
George Simon and Siti are mentioned as kings of Dotawo (Plumley 1978:235),
whereas the rulers in Dongola are Shekenda, Barak, Shemamun and Abi Abdal-
lah Kanz al-Dawla (Adams, ibid.).
   Again, this argumentation doesn’t consider that the different names come
from different sources. On the one hand we have the names found in the Nubian
sources, on the other hand we have the Arab sources such as al-Maqrizi who had
never been to Nubia, wrote about events which happened about a century before,
and who was a great compiler of different sources often not accurately quoted by
him.
    One has to bear in mind that by the end of the 13th century when the Arab au-
 hors resume their writing about Nubia, they describe a region in turmoil. The
reasons behind this instable political situation are neither revealed by Arab nor
by Nubian sources. The Arab sources, however, mention a king Dawid of Nubia
who had forcefully deposed his predecessor. Dawid is also the name of Piarl or
Paul of Dotawo’s predecessor. Piarl/Paul ruled around the year 1281 so that his
predecessor could have ruled in the seventies of the 13h century (comp. Plumley
 1978:234) when king Dawid of the Arab sources held the throne in Dongola. It
can therefore be assumed that the two Dawids were actually one person called
king of Dotawo in Nubian and King of Dongola in Arab sources.
   The different sources indicate that after Dawid’s deposition in 1276/77, the
Nubian unity fell apart. In Dongola, Shekenda succeeded to the throne in
1276/77 and swore by the Mameluke sultan “to bring to the Sultan all the private
property, goods and cattle, which belonged to Dawid” (Magqrizi in: Vantini228
 1975:650). He was murdered shortly after and replaced by Barak. In 1279, She-
 mamun (or Simamun) came to the throne and ruled until the nineties of the
 13th century. Two dated texts from Qasr Ibrim show that at the same time the
 kings of Dotawo were not identical to the above-mentioned kings: In 1281, the
 king of Dotawo is called Piarl or Paul, in 1287 Georgiu Simon. For the next
 decades, Arab sources mention Ammy,       Kerenbes and Barshambu as kings of
Dongola. In 1323, the Kanz ed-Dawla finally succeeded to the throne in Don-
gola, whereas at the same time Siti ruled in Dotawo.
    The Nobiin sources do not indicate that anything was out of order in the king-
dom. Although it is known that changes happened and that at some point Don-
gola lost its status as capital and had become the seat of vassal kings of the Ma-
meluke rulers of Egypt is far from clear how these changes came about.
   Evidently, it is the Arab discourse which constructs an empire on the verge of
disintegration. It might be speculated that this constitutes a kind of legitimizing
discourse for the coming into power of a new Arabic speaking elite in Nubia.
Whether all or some of the alleged kings mentioned in Arab sources actually
existed is unproven. Until now, no one seems to have wondered about the rather
untypical names Shekanda, Kerenbes and Barshambu who don’t seem to be of
Nobiin origin.
   It can therefore be concluded that Dotawo is in fact the Nobiin name of the
kingdom of Makuria, also known as Kingdom of Dongola, Nubia or Nobatia and
Makuria in Arab sources. The name was retained when the capital moved to the
north. This reconstruction resolves some of the discrepancies in the traditional
interpretation of the relationship between Dotawo and Makuria. Adams
(1991:261) wonders that the office of the Eparch (see below) who was tradition-
ally appointed by the king of Makuria survived into the 15th century although
since 1365 at the latest, the king no longer resided in Makuria. If we proceed on
the assumption that the two, Dotawo and Makuria, were identical, it is conse-
quential that the important office of the Eparch survived even in the much
smaller kingdom of the north.
   The equation of the two also solves the problem of the lack of written evi-
dence in Arab sources. These usually don’t bother with self-designations. Only
through Old Nobiin sources we now know about the self-designation for the

13.5 King and EparchThe Nubian kingdom was headed by the king, called uru in Old Nobiin. In the
Qasr Ibrim texts, the Greek title basileos is sometimes used and Arabic sources
speak of the “King of Makuria/Nubia” or of the “Great King” or, in a few sour-
ces, of the Kamil or Kabil, unrecorded in documents from Nubia itself. The
sources from Nubia do not reveal much information about the actual status, func-
tion and life of the king. He is mentioned in the introduction of sales contracts
and other official documents right after the Holy Trinity but as this part of the
texts is highly formulaic, this doesn’t help to bring light to this high office. An-
other presumed formula in a release of a slave (IT III 33) evokes the king’s
deadly curse against any person to act contrary to the release. A similar evocation
is found at the end of the only royal proclamation preserved in Old Nobiin
(ITIII 30). The king at the time of the proclamation (about           1155) was Moses
George who according to the texts also held the office of the Eparch of Palagi
(see below). His authority allowed him to free from servitude the Epimachus-
Church of Ibrim-West which obviously was bound to deliver wine or worm-
wood. There isn’t much more to be learned from the Nubian sources. This might
at least partially be due to the scarce written evidence from the royal residence at
Dongola. Non-Nubian sources on the other hand give information about the
Nubian     king which   seems   to be unsubstantiated. Abu     Salih the Armenian,    for
example, who wrote before 1200 AD and often—if not always—copied older
sources describes a Nubian priest king celebrating the liturgy within the sanctu-
ary. He repeats the same when writing about the Abyssinian kings and apparently
only reports what he heard about some unidentified southern kings (Vantini
1975:332, 339).
      As part of the historical construct of the unification of the two Nubian king-
doms, the office of the viceroy of the formerly independent kingdom of Nobatia
was “invented” (e. g. Adams 1977:464) and identified as the ‘Eparch of Nobadia’
documented in different sources. The Qasr Ibrim texts reveal that this interpreta-
tion is not based on the written sources but simply on the assumption that a for-
mer allegedly independent kingdom must at least have insisted on a viceroy as
second in command. As Adams later (1996) pointed out, the Eparch’s function
may have been overrated in the literature because according to the dominating
discourse on medieval Nubia, a viceroy had to be fitted in.
      In the context of lists containing titles of officials preserved in Qasr Ibrim, the
Eparch is only one amongst many and not set apart from the others. Adams tries
to explain the relationship between the Eparch of Nobatia and the king of Do-
tawo in the following way: “The best suggestion is probably that the king and the230
eparch held dominion over clearly distinct spheres of activity, the king being the
main source of civil and legal authority while the eparch was responsible for
trade and for relations with Muslims in general.” Taking a closer look at the lists,
it becomes evident that king and eparch are far from being on the same hierar-
chical level. The most detailed ones consist of two parts. The first part is headed
by the king of Dotawo, the king’s mother and some high officials close to the
 king. The second part begins with the words “and in Nobadia [...]” followed by
 the title and name of the Eparch and other dignitaries belonging to the region
 (Browne 1991). One sales contract explicitly describes the position of the Ep-
 arch: “[...] and in Nobadia all authority being attached to him“ (ibid., 42). In this
 context, Nobatia turns out to be subordinate to Dotawo rather than existing side
 by side.
     The texts furthermore reveal that more than one eparch was operating in Nu-
 bia. Other officials with this title are associated with Lower Nubia and Palagi. In
 a royal proclamation (IT III 30), king Moses George of Dotawo also held the
office of the Eparch of Palagi. The existence of several eparchal offices also
contradicts the notion of some kind of “deal” which was negotiated at the alleged
 unification of the Nubian kingdoms.
     Again, it seems interesting to look at what the different sources tell about the
eparch and his function. Starting with the title itself, the Greek eparchos is found
in some of the Old Nobiin sources, but much more often the Nobiin equivalent
soyoj is found. Both designations do not appear in Arabic documents. Instead,
the title “Lord of the Mountain” or “Lord of the Horses”, with both readings
possible in unpointed texts, are found. As the reading “Lord of the Mountain” is
supported by some pointed Arabic texts, Browne (e. g. 1991:xi) interpreted the
Nobiin title as consisting of yoj(j) ‘mountain’ and archaic or dialectal variant of
sa(e)- ‘governor’. This etymology is, however, far from being convincing. Sa(e)-
seems to be only documented once (ChN 4.8) and then in a context where it
refers to the captain of a ship. Furthermore, we would expect a different order of
the parts of the compound, because in Nobiin, the genitive usually precedes its
noun. It seems just as possible that the second element is related to Old Nobiin
yod- ‘Lord’.
   Adams (1996:245) reports that among the Qasr Ibrim texts, some letters writ-
ten in pointed Arabic and addressed to the Eparch were found in which the read-
ing “Lord of the Horses” or even “Lord of the King’s Horses” is equally undis-
putable. This matches the late Gerald Browne’s find that the Arabic “Lord of the
Horses” is a direct rendering of Old Nobiin mourt-in nod-il ‘horse-GEN lord-
SUBJ’ which is documented in a text (cited as pers. comm. in Adams 1996:245).
   We can conclude that in the case of the office of eparch, the Arab sources cor-
rectly translate at least one of his titles. Whether Nobiin soyoj corresponds to                                                                                  231
Arabic “Lord of the Mountain” remains dubious, as does the connection between
the two titles and the functions of the soyoj. In a letter of Eparch Masi (IT II 24),
the author writes that he was out in charge of the horses of his addressee. This
might indicate that the eparch was responsible for the welfare of horses but he
could just as well have been talking about a personal arrangement.
   In the Old Nobiin texts from Qasr Ibrim, the eparch presents himself primarily
through his correspondence. One of his duties was the disbursement of grain
mentioned in most of the eparchal letters in Old Nobiin. More information on the
functions of the eparch is found in the Arabic manuscripts which, unfortunately,
are not published yet. Preliminary reports about the content of some of these
manuscripts show that the eparch organized the trade with Muslim Egypt and
had also some diplomatic responsibilities (Plumley 1975:106). This for once
corresponds to what Arab sources tell about the eparch. His office looms large in
these texts which is not surprising given that he presumably was the most impor-
tant official the Muslim traders had to deal with. Detailed information on the
“Lord of the Mountain” is found in al-Magrizis renarration of al-Aswani’s ac-
count (Vantini 1975:602ff.). He is described as representative of the Nubian king
and any Moslem who wanted to trade in Nubia had to deal with him. According
to al-Aswani/al-Maqrizi, one of his responsibilities is to prevent any trader or
traveler to proceed further upstream to Dongola without a travel permit. As the
‘Lord of the Mountain’ was responsible for the relationship with Egyptian Mus-
lims, he might also have been the official to take care of the bagt-treaty which
regulated the provision of slaves to Egypt in exchange for manufactured goods
and which also guaranteed freedom to travel and settle in northern Nubia to Mus-
lims from Egypt and elsewhere. This, however, can only be indirectly deduced
and is not actually documented in the written sources (comp. Adams
1996:245ff.).
   For the obvious reasons indicated above the Arab sources seem to be only in-
terested in the Eparch of Nobadia. But even the sources from Nubia itself do not
reveal how, aside from dealing with the Moslem north, his duties differ from
those of the eparchs of Lower Nobadia and Palagi. One order from Tamsi, Ep-
arch of Lower Nobadia (IT III 46), also concerns the disposal of grain. It would,
however, over-interpret the scant evidence to assume that the office of the eparch
was always connected with central grain storing facilities.","[229, 230, 231, 232]"

 10.9 Stativepi- ‘to be, to lie’ is often used independently in Old Nobiin texts, especially in
 geographical descriptions where it expresses that a plot ‘lies’ somewhere. It is
 one of the verbs employed in verbal complexes after adjunctive -a. In these con-
 structions, the verb supposedly functions as a stative (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996: 143,
 Browne 1998c:237—238). Some examples from the texts are:
 (IT15i3-4)
 [...] kit-ka     g[el]gel-tak-a   pal-a          pi-n
 [...] stone-OB) roll-PASS-ADJ     come out-AD)   be/lie-3SGPRESSUB ‘[she saw] that the stone was rolled away (lit.: ‘lies coming out being rolled’)’ This example shows a verbal complex with two adjunctives and the final pi-.
 Here, pi- followed by present tense suffixes of the subjunctive marks a state at a
 time contemporaneous with that of the main verb which in this case is in the pre-
 terit II. The state results from an action—the rolling away of the stone—divided
 into the action itself gelgel- ‘roll’ which is marked as passive by tak-, and the
 next to last verb pal- which functions as a directional. The directional is missing
 in a similar example from the same text. Here, however, the talk is of a headcloth
 and the connotation is not that it is rolled away from a place, but rolled up and
 lying somewhere:
  176
 (IT 1 5 123-24)

 other   place one-in   roll-PASS-ADJ      _be/lie-3SGPRESSUB *[which] was rolled up alone in another place’ The next sentence is part of a longer direct speech (1 Cor 2). In this instance, the
 complex is marked as preterit which might be due to the fact that the hiding
 spoken of happened before the time of speaking.
(IT17 ii 11)
 mystir      _—_igir-tak-a pi-ol-la
 mystery     hide-PASS-AD) be/lie-PARTPRETI-in
 ‘the mystery which was being hidden’The last example again has pi- marked as present, because it is contemporaneous
to the time of the main verb:
(CHN 8, 12-13)
tuskono di-j-ol-gu-na                    gad-gu-kon     —sursur-(ta)k-a    pi-ran
already dic-PL-PARTPRETI-PL-GEN          body-PL-and    disturb-PASS-ADJ _ be/lie-3PLPRESSUB
‘and the bodies of those already dead were disturbed’Regarding the examples analyzed so far, it has to be noted that pi- seems to indi-
cate a state resulting from some past action. All sentences also have in common
that they are additionally marked as passive. This could imply that all the Nobiin
verbs involved were transitive and had to be detransitivized in a stative construc-
tion. As in other languages too, dynamic passive connotations could figure in
some of the examples. Unfortunately, there are not enough examples documented
in the texts to draw any definite conclusion. We have, however, the Modern No-
biin data for comparison.
    In Modern Nobiin, -fii- which is the regular correspondence to Old Nobiin -pi-
is still present as an independent verb ‘to lie, to be’ but also used in a verbal com-
plex. As its predecessor in Old Nobiin, -/ii is always attached to the adjunctive -a.
Lepsius (1880:303) who didn’t recognize the adjunctive function of -a neverthe-
less mentions the complex with -fii in his dictionary and describes it as express-
ing a state. In the gospel of St. Mark, numerous examples for the present as well
as the preterit can be found some of which are also marked as passives. As these
are important for the comparison with Old Nobiin, they will be discussed first:

verbs which are detransitivized by the passive marker -fakk-. The 3"" person plu-
ral ending -fan of the first sentence seems irregular but is actually a compound
suffix consisting of the plural subject marker -j- (see chapter 8.3) and the ending
-san. The plural subject marker seems to be obligatory in the stative although
Werner (1987:185) noted one exception to this rule in his sentences. There are,
however, more examples to be found for stative constructions which do not re-
quire this type of transformation. Some of these are:

 which are interesting to discuss. The verb daa- ‘to be, exist’ is followed by fii- in
 the majority of cases. According to Abel (1913:86), no difference in meaning can
 be deduced whether daa- stands alone or has the stative marker.
 (Erm 22)
 laakini    faalal-la   da-fii-le     semmi-ga      __uudec-c-on        wild-in-doro

 da- and fii-, a container of sort is involved that holds different kinds of material.
 Whether this is the decisive criteria for the combination of the two elements is,
 however, questionable. Contrary to other sentences with da- ‘to be’, a persisting
 State is described whenever /ii- follows.                In each case, an actual stative meaning
seems to be involved. In contrast, constructions with fii- missing often express
situations that have already been terminated at the time of speaking or any other
reference time, as in
(Erm. 46)
geraia-ltoni ud-dan            daa-siin-ahara —_— noog-iddo ki-kum-mun                 afaa-n-doro

(Erm. 69)

you-where       be-2PLINTERROGPRES-[DS.]“where have you been?’The combination also seems to be impossible in connection with negative and
irtrealis formations.
    Besides the constructions with da- ‘to be’ discussed above, Abel’s Ermenne
narrative contains examples for stative constructions comparative to those found
in Lepsius’ gospel. The following sentence may serve as an example:
(Erm 72)
ju-a-goni       —_iden-ga        simark-a-fi-ni                    el-on

‘she went and found the woman who was angry’                                                                                                        179
Although a regular stative interpretation of this sentence is appropriate there is
another connotation present which is even more prominent in the next examples:
(Erm. 40)
