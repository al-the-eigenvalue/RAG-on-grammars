remains, but the 'yes' meaning is lost.

20.1. Information ('wh-') questions
In an information question, the questioned phrase is substituted by a 'wh-
phrase' such as àdl 'who', iggS si 'where from', and so on. The wh-
phrase can remain in place, or can be left-dislocated either to the
beginning of its clause, or in some cases to the beginning of a higher
clause. In general, wh-questions appear to have the syntax of equivalent
declarative sentences. Intonation is not distinctive for wh-questions
(unlike yes-no questions which end on a final high tone).",[625]
"There is no rising tone in these sentences, suggesting that òlè by itself is
able to code the utterance as a question.

which case they are interpreted as 'direct' questions.(181)    má      pi           zi         pi         dü     ópi     ?à       rubia           ra

            Ί am asking you, ""Did you definitely take Opi's money?'""Indirect yes-no questions have two distinct characteristics, both relating to
focus. The subordinate clause is focused, usually either by the standard
event-focusing strategy LOW-?? or by jà + ?? (possibly jà + LOW-??; if
syntactically present the low determiner would be phonologically deleted).(182)    o-ni           ru         kü                    k-é-mú             rá         jà                    ?ì

                               QuestionsIn this chapter we look at wh-questions and yes-no questions. Wh-
questions have the syntax of declarative sentences, with the wh-phrase in
place or left-dislocated just like a non-wh-phrase. Yes-no questions have
the syntax of declarative sentences with a final rising tone. We look at
various specialised words used in questions, carrying various
(conventional) implicatures.","[623, 624, 625]"
"Thus some other element must be present in these sentences to terminate
the verb, such as ra in the following sentence.(169)   jú                mü                ra
         2S       go          AFF                Q

which is found in Lokai Ma'di. Like the high tone question particle
discussed in the previous section, the question particle cannot terminate an
uninflected verb.(170)   j- n i                           màdî                  dì         òté        ä

            'Do you definitely know this person?' (Lokai)
20.3.1.3.     Final ámThe word am can be added to the end of a sentence finally to turn it into a
question, asking why the action was not undertaken, or to make a
suggestion. This is a polite strategy. There is no rising intonation, and am
must be sentence-final. Note that it does not terminate the verb,
suggesting that it is possibly external to the sentence (7.5).(172)   jû       dü         iza          zi            kü            ám

         given him a good one)ani may be derived from adu 'what' + ni the benefactive postposition,
and thus meaning 'for what?' Thus it is probably not be related to its
homophone ám which is a third person pronoun with various uses (cf. its
meaning in 'looks like a...', 11.5.3).
634     Questions20.3.1.4.      Final jàFinal jà is found only in subordinate clauses. It is found in both yes-no
and wh-questions; jà is also used in conditionals to express doubt or a
weakened probability, jà possibly functions to affirm, similarly to ra, with
a meaning of 'is it the case that..?'. It is like a gambit, used in shouting
especially where there is a distance between the speakers. Note that there
is no high tone at the end, although it is a yes-no question, jà cannot
terminate an uninflected verb.(175)    ma /<?       pi     mu      ra   jà

        'Will you definitely be going?'jà is used also, in alternation with a floating low tone, after a sentence
ending in hjgórìi which is a complement to 'know'. In questions it cannot
be replaced by a floating high tone.(177)    äwi-ä                    hjgorit          jà         m         má            ni         kö

"
11.1.1.2.    Bare demonstrativeA noun phrase consisting just of a demonstrative can function as a
predicate, but only if it has a non-specific interpretation, something like
'here' or gestural 'this'.(2)       ma       dì
          IS       this
          Ί am here.' (In answer to a question 'Where are you in this

            'This / here is the black goat (in question).'","[235, 236]"
"Note that in the previous sentence the ri phrase is not followed by the
focus/predication particle ?i, which would be required if the phrase was
final within its clause. This is our justification for thinking that the
demonstrative is within the subordinate clause and final within that clause,
rather than outside the subordinate clause and thus after it.

"Example (12) is drawn from one of the texts at the end of this grammar
(page 695, example 182) and shows a complex noun phrase which does
not end on a definite determiner but is nonetheless interpreted as definite

actually the demonstrative followed by the low tone determiner). When

followed by something in the sentence; we call this the 'termination
constraint' (7.5). The final high tone is not able to terminate the
uninflected verb.(167)* pi        mü

642       Questions20.4.3.          The use of pi fi to express covert disagreementpi fi 'you say' is used when a person wants to sound polite about a
statement that she believes is wrong, but does not want to disagree with
the speaker, perhaps a superior or an elder or simply out of politeness;
instead she poses the same issue as a question. The result is to give a
meaning of 'do you think...' or 'does it seem to you...'. The structure is
that of a 'yes-no' question.(224)      pi     fi     opt    δ-cfü     m

            otherwise. Rather than say so she poses it as a question.)She could have made a plain denial (225) or a plain 'Do you think... /

18.1.2.3 kúwá 'never'kúwá can be translated as 'never', or 'at all', kúwá can appear on its own,
as an answer to a question and meaning 'never'. Or it can be freely

20.3.3.4.        Úákìà is a more disparaging way of saying 'no' used to devalue the worth
of a person or a proposal. Unlike the others, this word is only found in

nonverbal predications.(208)   kìà        , opi      ?1         ku

phrase or word ('wh-phrase' or 'wh-word'). These include àdû 'what',
adì 'who', both of which substitute for noun phrases, and iqgò 'which',

obligatorily focused.

15.12.     'Grammatical' location nounsWhere a location word can take a preceding complement (the located
thing), we suggest two alternative possibilities as to structure. Some
location words are, we argue, true postpositions; others are nouns which
are pre-possessed by the locations. The postpositions take the preceding
noun phrases as complements, and in general must have a preceding
complement. The location nouns are in general possessed by the
preceding noun (often with full possession syntax), and in general can
stand without a preceding 'located' noun phrase; many of the location
nouns must be embedded under the postposition gá.
   These are the words we consider to be location nouns rather than
postpositions:Table 44. Nouns of location.

3.5.2.5. Tone in compounds
When two words are combined in a compound, the tones on the
compound are carried over from the component words.        dri     'head'   £H     'hair'   drißi    'head hair'
        6su     'peas'   bi     'leaf    ósóbi    'peas leaf (as vegetable)'
3.5.2.6. Tone in reduplicated wordsThese generally involve exact copying of the tones along with the
segmental structure (but see also 6.1.1.2).              âjisé âfisé         'green' (grass-like)

3.5.3. Floating tonesSeveral grammatical morphemes are realised as floating tones. They
include:
(i)       A low tone which is prefixed to a nonpast verb (8.8.1).
(ii)      A low tone which follows a noun phrase, which is a determiner
          expressing specificity; 12.6.
(iii)     A low tone which comes at the end of a clause, possibly related to
          the specific determiner. This low tone is responsible for the low
42      Phonetics         final tone on the verbal copy in verb focus (19.12.2), and possibly
         also for the low tone of the focus marker ni which might be
         interpreted as pronominal ni plus a low tone (19.5.5).
(iv)     A high tone which is the subject prefix form of the
         indefinite/inclusive subject pronoun (6.4.5).
(v)      (Possibly) a high tone prefix to the postposition dm (4.3.3.2), and
         to other postpositions (15.6.2.1).
(vi)     A high tone in yes/no questions, in final position (20.3.1.1).
(vii)    (Possibly) an 'intimacy marker', expressed by a rise-fall contour
         after a verb (3.6.3).","[57, 58]"
"For some of the ii-adverbials, there is an ambiguity between treating the
word as an adverbial or treating it as an adjective. In the following
example, gloss (242a) treats the word as an adjective and thus permits the
η-phrase to be the adjoined subject. Gloss (242b) in contrast treats the
word as an adverbial and thus the phrase is a true /r-adverbial.(242)    π π          η         é-mú              ni

word. However, the fact that the first part can be replaced by the other
particles, and the second part can be replaced in some cases by the
determiner ni suggests that this is a sequence of the particle followed by
the definite article.
    There is some reason to think that ra ri and other particle + ri
combinations might be the righmost remnants at the end of an ellipted
clause (with only ra remaining at the end of it); evidence comes from data
like the following, where the particle + ri seems to be a fragment of a
relative clause in subject position of a nonverbal clause.(243)    dn     d^è-rë        ra      π      adi    Ti

determiner such as rì but can have either an indefinite or a definite
interpretation. Noun phrases of this kind are focused with ?7. Focus is
either contrastive or noncontrastive.(38)        má    1ε     kubâjà        pélérè ri       ?1

18.1   Freely placed adverbialsFreely placed adverbials express a range of meanings including location
in time and fixing the temporal reference point, modality and negation,
hearsay, contrast, etc. The adverbials and their meanings are listed in
Table 45. Freely placed adverbials can appear at the beginning of the
sentence or at the end of the sentence or between almost any pair of
sentence-level constituents. This is illustrated in the following examples,
where @ indicates positions where the adverbials in question can appear.(1)     @      p-ogù      @ opi      ?a     gán @        jü ?1       @
