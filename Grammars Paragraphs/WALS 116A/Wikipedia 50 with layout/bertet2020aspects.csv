7.9       Pragmatic uses of negation in interaction
    Interro-negative questions with /=tá/ ‘fut’, as in (654), or /=chi ́/ ‘irr’, as
in (655), are often pragmatically used for suggestion or invitation (‘Won’t you/
they …?’ = ‘I suggest you/they ….’; see also example (609) above):(654)     Tãů tá kū-chi ́bü?̀
             ̊ =tá

        ̊ (or its variant tãu
     Tãu
above) is regularly used pragmatically as a way to answer a content question in a
deliberately vague way, out of self-effacement (in which case tãů is often followed
by a more precise answer) or in order to elude a question (‘Well, nothing special,
(it’s just that …)’), as in the following example (repeated from (450)):312(656)     “Åkǘka̰ kū-dău?” ñâʼü.̃́ “Tãů , tére̋ í méʼkür̋ àʼükǖ
                                                               ̃̀ īchā-fè rǜ nŭʼà chírḛ ī-g̃û rǜ

     This pragmatic use of tãů ‘neg’ is likely related to the fact that tãů probably comes from tåʼúʼü̃́
(‘nothing’, among other possible glosses) etymologically (see Section 7.2.1 above).","[544, 545, 546]"

with the possible effect of forcing the use of /yà=rǖ=/ ‘am=pcrǖ=’ and /yà=

nà=/ ‘am=pcnà=’ and ? /yà=nà=/ ‘am=pcnà.3m/n/ns.obj=’, respectively.
My data do not allow me to settle this question.",[441]
"   The reasons why I tentatively analyze these two subsystems of locative partici-
pant indexation and partitive object participant indexation as belonging to the same
morphosyntactic slot are because 1) they never co-occur within the same inflected
predicative phrase in my data (negative evidence) and 2) they appear to share
one morpheme, specifically /ne̋=/ (and possibly its subdialectal variant /nű=/),
which is featured in both subsystems although with different functions (positive
but uncertain evidence). This question could probably be easily settled by further
research.",[464]
"    In answers to interro-negative questions (e.g. ‘Don’t you like it?’), pro-senten-
tial negation is pragmatically used for confirmation by the speaker of the as-
sumption of the addressee (‘No, [I don’t like it indeed.]’), as shown in the follow-
ing example:(648)    [Tãů tàã̄ k[i ̄]-pà?]—Tãů ʼü!̃́         tãů =tàã̄   k[i ̄]=pà                           ̊ ʼü̃́
                                                           tãu
         neg=itself 2sg.sbj.pci ̄=be.tired neg         ‘[(Denis Bertet:) Aren’t you tired yet?]—No [I’m not]!’ [jsg A403]7.7      Negative imperative
    Negation cannot co-occur with a predicative phrase in the Imperative Inflec-
tional Type (on which see Section 5.4). The negative imperative construction used
to express prohibitives, whether with a singular or a plural second person subject,
seems to be based on the negation focus construction described in Section 7.5
above (focalized.negative.word (inflected.copula) (lk=)clause.in.sbjv-
sub). By contrast to the negation focus construction, however, the prohibitive con-
struction does not seem to ever involve the use of the inflected copula, and it often—
although not obligatorily—includes an additional specialized prohibitive second
position enclitic /=tā/ ‘proh’ (focalized.negative.word=proh (lk=)
clause.in.sbjv-sub).309 My corpus and elicitation notes only contain cases of pro-
hibitives involving the negative word tãů ‘neg’, such as the following:(649)    Tãů (tā) (i ̀) “nôʼe̋” ña̋kùʼü̃́ tüʼ̂ ü!̃̄
            ̊ (=tā)
         tãu              (i ̀=)nôʼe̋                ña̋-kù-ʼü̃́    tü-̂ ʼü̃̄
         neg=proh lk.ns=old.woman do.thus-2sg.sbj\sbjv-sub 3s-acc         ‘Don’t call her “grandma”!’ [ear elic.]
(650)    Tãů tā ì pē-chókùgüʼ̋ ü!̃́ 309
     According to ear, using the (optional) linker in the prohibitive construction imparts extra
directive strength to the prohibition and may make it sound more threatening.",[543]
"   The use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in polar questions is illustrated in the following example:(486)   Kűnà-mêʼü?̃́
        kű=nà=mê-ʼü̃́
        2sg.ben=3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=be.good\sbjv-sub
                                                                                     421
5. Inflection of the predicative phrase
        ‘Did you like it?’ [jsg C166]
    Examples (487) and (488) illustrate the use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in utterances involving
deontic modality, with a first person subject and a fourth person subject respec-
tively (see (477) and (467) above for instances of deontic sbjv-ʼü̃́ involving a second
person subject and a third person subject, respectively). Note that deontic sbjv-ʼü̃́
can occur in both declarative utterances (as in (488)) and interrogative utterances
(as in (487)).","[426, 427]"
"                                                                                                        541
7. Negation
        ‘“What are you looking for?” [she] asked. “Well, nothing special, I’ve shot
        a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t find it.”’ [jsg
        B220–222]    Rhetorical questions are often used to convey an emphatic negative excla-
mative meaning. In this discursive strategy, the referent asked about is implicitly
meant not to exist, or in other words an interrogative word is used instead of its
corresponding negative existential indefinite (as in e.g. ‘What did he do…?’ =
‘He did (absolutely) nothing!’). This is illustrated in examples (657–658) (see also
(T56)). Compare (657) with (622) for a parallel utterance featuring the correspond-
ing explicitly negative construction. In (658), the corresponding negative sentence
is uttered immediately after the rhetorical question, yielding a binary discursive
structure interrogative.sentence+negative.sentence of relatively common
use in the language:(657)    ̋ yà-dăugǘ ũʼ̄ à: g̃eʼ̀ è...?

Appendix AInterlinearized text: episodes from
the myth of Ngutapa as told by Loida
Ángel RuizThis appendix provides a fully interlinearized transcription of about two thirds of
a recording of the first few episodes of the mythological cycle of Ngutapa and
his children as told by Loida Ángel Ruiz (lar, ♀, 49 y.o.). The corresponding
recording (recording C by lar in Table 1) was made on November 5, 2016 in
lar’s house in sma. This recording is 35’17” long altogether, of which the first
21’55” are transcribed in what follows. This entirely monological text is generally
representative of traditional Tikuna mythological storytelling. Note, however, that
I was the only hearer present during most of the performance, which is a highly
unusual speech setting for this kind of Tikuna verbal art.","[546, 547, 548, 549, 550]"
"    The conjunction ēgá (also /gá=/) ‘if’ can be realized as ngēgá and may there-
fore have been formerly another ngē-/ye̊- word. A hypothetical corresponding pre-
hodiernal past form *ye̊gá is not attested in my data, however, and was explicitly
rejected in elicitation. The enclitic /=ēkà/, which generally expresses unsureness
of the speaker and is mostly employed in direct questions to make them more in-
sistent, might also be a former ngē-/ye̊- word. Against this hypothesis, however,
are the fact that it does not seem to be realizable as *ngēkà and that a hypothetical
corresponding pre-hodiernal past form *ye̊kà is unattested in my data.",[255]
"    This strategy for number encoding is illustrated by the contrast between exam-
ples (571) and (572) (the latter being repeated from (455b) above). These largely
parallel examples differ in the selection of the form of the figure-ground configu-
ration suffix featured in their essentially synonymous main predicative phrases. In
(571), the singular allomorph /-ē/ of the figure-ground configuration suffix mean-
ing ‘off’ is selected for, while it is its plural allomorph /-ǜ̃/ that is used in (572). Be-
cause the predicative phrases in question are transitive, the selection of /-ē/ ‘off.sg’
in (571) indicates that the object argument is singular (in this case, a mash), while
the selection of /-ǜ̃/ ‘off.pl’ in (572) indicates that the object argument is plural (in
this case, plantains).",[498]
"    Interestingly, whether the target of the deictic verb is a piece of discourse, a ges-
ture, an anaphoric, or a non-finite verb, its exact syntactic function cannot be es-
tablished with certainty. As a corollary, whether the deictic verb is morphosyn-
tactically intransitive or transitive appears to be an unanswerable question.
From a strictly morphosyntactic perspective, nothing definitively precludes from
analyzing the deictic verb’s target as a core object, since core objects in smat are
in the zero-case, i.e. are left morphologically unmarked for their syntactic function.
Thus, there is the possibility that the anaphoric ngēmà ‘that’ in example (585),
which stands in the zero-case, is indeed to be interpreted as the core object ar-
gument of the deictic verb. On the other hand, no language internal facts seem
to offer positive evidence for the analysis of the deictic verb’s target as its object.
Regular predicative phrases can be unequivocally told to be transitive or intransi-
tive depending on whether or not they require the indexation of a core object in
contexts where, all other things being equal, they are not preceded by any syn-
tactic NP (in the zero-case) that might function as their core object (thus fè ‘to
shoot’ in /kŏwǘ ná=fè/ [deer 3m/n/ns.sbj=shoot] ‘she/he shot the deer’ can be
definitively identified as a transitive verb because */ná=fè/ is not acceptable as
is with the meaning ‘he shot (it)’, which can only be conveyed by /ná=nā=fè/
[3m/n/ns.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=shoot], i.e. with the inclusion of an object index).
The inflectional paradigm of the deictic verb does not seem to display any marking
for object indexes, but this cannot be taken as definitive evidence for the verb’s
intransitive nature due to its morphological uniqueness in the language (see Sec-
tion 6.2). In principle, it might simply be that the deictic verb, although transitive,
has the unique morphological ability to occur without an object index in contexts
where it lacks an object NP preceding it. These considerations leave open the
question of the syntactic relationship, if any, that holds between the deictic
verb and its target in smat. This is why I have opted for labeling the target with
a syntactically neuter term, instead of referring to as e.g. a complement.",[510]

someone to rest’—has the lexicalized meaning ‘to help (someone)’. The synchron-
ically unanalyzable verb stem g̃ʼŭʼẽʼ́ e ‘to wait for someone’ was most likely histor-
ically derived as the /-ʼẽʼ́ e/-causative form of a former verb root *g̃ʼŭ no longer

pheme of any sort filling the syntactic position that would be occupied by /gá=/ if
they were to be marked as referring to past processes. This observation is illustrated
in the following example:(260)   Mā nǖkù-fa̋ʼü̃́ náʼa åkǘ nà-trataʼü̃́ i ̀ ñåà?

        ‘[After telling a story from a book to his young son:] Do you know what
        this is about, now?’ [jsg C168]   This observation questions whether the morpheme /gá=/ that marks sub-
ordinate clauses referring to past processes actually is to be analyzed as a
form of the linker. Analyzing it that way implies considering that the linker ex-
hibits a defective distribution in its occurrences on subordinate clauses. Such an
analysis further implies to consider a syntactic constituent such as chà-bûʼgù ‘when I
was young’ in (257) as the syntactic equivalent of a nominal constituent, given that
the linker, in all of its other uses, can only be procliticized to nominal constituents.
Although the marker /gá=/ of subordinate clauses referring to past processes is
most likely cognate with the linker, it might in fact be better analyzed, from a syn-
chronic perspective, as a separate morpheme rather than as an inflectional form of
the linker.","[274, 275]"

        ‘Once it’s a fallow swidden, you leave it as is [lit. ‘..., aside with it ...’] and
        you no longer touch it.’ [lar D281–282]Unexplainably, these forms may also be directly inflected like predicative phrases,
with the meaning ‘to leave X in peace’, ‘to forget about X’ (with X being the referent
of the demonstrative root), as shown in the following example:(212)                                          ̋ ārēãʼ̀ ü.̃́

        96]    In my data, the demonstrative roots, when they are directly suffixed with a “fo-
cal” suffix and are therefore left unspecified by /-à/ ‘exo’ or /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’,
happen to always exhibit an endophoric function (anaphora/cataphora or dis-
course deixis), i.e. to behave semantically and pragmatically as though they bore
the suffix /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’. This might be due to chance, however, and need not
necessarily imply that the demonstrative roots are in fact inherently endophoric,
unless explicitly specified as exophoric by the suffix /-à/ ‘exo’. It could be that in
cases where the demonstrative roots are morphologically unspecified for exo- or
endophoricity, their exact function is in fact to be interpreted contextually. This
interesting question could be easily settled by further research.","[246, 247]"

6. The deictic verb
    The subject of the deictic verb is typically an animate referent, as in most
examples in this section, or less frequently a concrete, inanimate referent. But
it may also occasionally be an abstract entity, such as a speech, a story, a call,
a song, a thought, a person’s mind, etc. In such cases, the deictic verb does not,
strictly speaking, refer to a process (‘do thus’) being carried out by the subject. It can
rather be considered in practice as the equivalent of an equative verb, and functions
more specifically as a deictic equative verb (‘be thus’). Its specialized use is then
to introduce a linguistic, cognitive, or vocalic object that is being equated with
the subject. This is illustrated in example (618), where the ‘speaking’ (déʼà) that
is taking place is equated with, or defined as, the question enclosed in quotation
marks (see also example (594) below):(588)                                    ̃́ ñâʼü̃́ ãʼ̄ a, “<kù-...> tōkù-tàʼkùʼü?”

        were their words [lit. ‘... thus did their speaking.’].’ [lar C404–405]   In addition to a subject argument, the deictic verb may optionally take an ar-
gument marked for the accusative case (to be distinguished from a core object,
which does not bear any syntactic-function marking, as mentioned above) in cases
where it specifically refers to an uttering-process (i.e. a piece of linguistic discourse
actually spoken). The referent of that argument is the addressee of the uttering-
process mentioned by the speaker. This is illustrated at the end of example (582)
above. Note that such accusative arguments may only consist of explicit nps as they
cannot be indexed on the deictic verb.","[510, 511]"

‘conj’ is frequently dropped, as in the following example:                                                                                                   425

phrase of that matrix clause. Most of the time, an expletive cataphoric third
person non-salientive pronominal form (whether a free pronominal form, or
an index occurring within the predicative phrase as in (494–495)) precedes, or
is included in, the predicative phrase of the matrix clause and fills the syntactic
position of the complement clause (compare English ‘it is true that …’, ‘it is hard
to ...’).","[430, 431]"
"   Examples (21a–21b) display independent nouns containing a same-syllable coda
/ʔ/. Example (21c) shows a zero-derived nominalization of the verb /ʥɯʔ31 / ‘to

2. Phonetics and phonology
As an exception to this rule, these same realizations obtain when a verb used pred-
icatively is immediately followed by the suffix /-∼ʔɯ4 / [...ʔɯ̃ 4 ] ‘sub’, by any
form of the relativizer suffix, or by the suffix /-ʔgu4/1 / [...ʔgu4 ]∼[...ʔgu1 ]
‘circ’. The former case is illustrated in example (23a) and the latter in (23b):23 (23)     a. /∼da4 =deʔ34 -∼ʔɯ4 / [nã4 ˈd̪eː̞ 34 ʔe̞4 ʔɯ̃ 4 ] ‘(that) it’s yellow’
          b. /∼duʔ31 -ʔe1 /               [ˈnũː31 ʔũ5 ʔe̞1 ]    ‘a short one (e.g. a machete)’    As shown in Table 8, the epenthetic vowel that regularly arises in Situations 1
and 2 is in most cases a copy vowel identical in quality to the vowel nucleus of the
stressed syllable containing the same-syllable coda /ʔ/ (first five rows in Table 8).
In two cases (sixth and seventh rows), specifically when the vowel nucleus of the
stressed syllable containing the same-syllable coda /ʔ/ is an /a/ or what I label here
an /o2 /, the arising epenthetic vowel is [ɯ] rather than a copy vowel. Note that
the distinction exceptionally made in Table 8 between a subtype of the phoneme
/o/ represented as /o1 / and another one represented as /o2 / is a purely lexical
one: this distinction is only relevant in smat phonology in the present context and
reflects the fact that some—in practice, a majority of—stressed morphemes with
a same-syllable coda /ʔ/ featuring the nucleus /o/ trigger a mere copy vowel in
Situations 1 and 2 (these are represented here as featuring /o1 /), while others—in
practice, a minority—cause an [ɯ] to arise (these are represented here as featuring
/o2 /; for another instance of /o2 /, see example (21a) above).24 Finally, in cases
where the vowel nucleus of the stressed syllable containing the same-syllable coda
/ʔ/ is complex, i.e. when that nucleus is /ai/ or /au/ (last two rows), the position of
the epenthetic vowel is occupied by the second vowel component of that complex
vowel nucleus. Non-underlying syllables arising on the surface due to the insertion
of an epenthetic vowel after a same-syllable coda /ʔ/ belonging with a stressed
syllable are realized with a tone [3 ] (see end of Section 2.4.3 below), unless they
occur in a morphosyntactic context where morphotonological alternations apply
  23
    On the tonal realization of the non-underlying syllables arising due to the insertion of an
epenthetic vowel in these examples, see end of Section 2.4.3.
  24
     This /o1 / vs /o2 / distinction, a strictly lexical one with no corresponding phonetic reality in
today’s language, possibly reflects the fact that a number of instances of the phoneme /o/ in contem-
porary smat (among which all cases of /o2 /) may have evolved diachronically from former *[a]’s
(or a phone close to [a]). This would explain why some /o/’s, specifically /o2 /’s, seem to behave
as /a/’s as far as the epenthetic vowel they trigger is concerned. On this complex question, see
Section 2.8.3.","[81, 82, 83]"
"
    In the following elicited example, however, a positive existential indefinite (g̃eʼ̀ ta̋
  310‘where?.aloc’) co-occurs with tãů ‘neg’ within a single negative clause:   (i) Tãů tā g̃eʼ̀ ta̋ kù-ũʼ̂ ü!̃́

       tãu                  g̃eʼ̀ ta̋   kù=ũ-̂ ʼü̃́

       ‘Don’t move from there [lit. ‘Don’t go anywhere!’]!’ [ear elic.]     It might thus be that negative polarity in prohibitive utterances always has to be marked by
tãů ‘neg’, regardless of whether existential indefinites are present in the clause or not—while in
declarative and interrogative utterances (see Section 7.5 above), these existential indefinites, if
present, would have been the regular locus for the encoding of negative polarity. However, it
might also be that the example cited above is a rarer and somewhat artificial alternative to an
expected (but unattested) ? Tåʼúwa̋ tā kù-ũʼ̂ ü!̃́ [lit. ‘Go nowhere!’], where negative polarity would be
encoded within the negative existential indefinite (tåʼúwa̋ ‘nowhere’) itself. The details of the smat
prohibitive construction will require more exploration.",[544]
"   In this function, however, the proximal endophoric demonstrative is in most
cases replaced by the proximal exophoric in younger speakers, as in the fol-
lowing example, where the proximal exophoric ño̊má would have been equally cor-
rect and would have conveyed the same meaning (see also (159) above, where the
proximal exophoric dômà could probably have been used instead of the proximal
exophoric dâà):(187)   [...] ñṵmá i ̀ ñåà mundowa̋ chā-sufre i ̀ chòmà.

quite correspond to this “symbolic use”, however, as in examples (188–189). It
is unclear what its exact semantic and pragmatic value is in these rare occurrences.
The discourse contexts of (188) and (189) would rather have led to expect a medial

a proximal endophoric, since the referents in question have been previously estab-

"   The phoneme transcribed as /ɯ/ is typically realized as the unrounded close
back vowel [ɯ], although it may occasionally be slightly fronted into the unrounded
close central vowel [ɨ], especially when it immediately follows the palatal conso-
nant phonemes /ʨ/ or /ʥ/, as in the following example:  (9) /ʨɯ34 ta3 /                 [ˈʨɯː34 t ̪a3 ]∼[ˈʨɨː34 t ̪a3 ]          ‘to get dark’    Stressed syllables may feature one of two sequences of two vowel nuclei in a row,
specifically the sequences /ai/ and /au/. These are realized as the diphthongs [a͡ɪ]
and [a͡ʊ] respectively (or [ã͡ɪ ̃] and [ã͡ʊ̃] in nasal or nasalized syllables; see below), as
in examples (10a–10b), unless they are separated by a glottal stop on the surface,
as in (22c) (see Section 2.1.3.1). An additional sequence, /ou/ [o̞͡ʊ], is marginally
attested in onomatopoeic words, as in (10d), and in the interjection /ʔou43 / [ʔo̞͡ʊ43 ]
‘Yes?, What?’ (used in reply to someone else’s call). No other sequences of vowel
nuclei within a single syllable are attested in my data. (10)       a. /ʔai43 du4 we4 /        [ˈʔa͡ɪ43 ɾu4 we̞4 ]          ‘manatee’21

nasal syllables (as in the first syllable of the words in examples (11b), (12b), and
(13)) and, via surface nasality spreading, in nasalized non-nasal syllables that
follow a nasal syllable. Surface nasality spreads “to the right” from any nasal sylla-
ble up to the next consonant other than /ʔ/ or to the end of the prosodic word. In

4.4.5          Other suffixes4.4.5.1        /-māe/̄ ‘compar’    The suffix /-māe/̄ ‘compar’ derives stative comparative predicative phrases
(e.g. ‘be bigger (than ...)’) from pcØ243 intransitive stative predicative phrases
(in most cases a verb stem predicating a quality, e.g. ‘be big’). Suffixing /-māe/̄
to a given predicative phrase systematically shifts the latter’s predicative class
to pcrǖ. Contrast in the following example the pcrǖ form /ná=rǖ=mů-māe/̄
[3m/n/ns.sbj=pcrǖ=be.several-compar] ‘they are more’ to the corresponding
non-comparative pcØ form /ná=mů/ [3m/n/ns.sbj=be.several] ‘they are many’:(392)    Hmmm, nárǖ-můmāē i ̀ buenogüʼ̋ ü.̃́         ngü̂ ná=rǖ=mů-māē                                          i ̀=bueno-gü-̋ ʼü̃́

features a single position, namely for a subject argument. When these are suffixed
with /-māe/̄ , although they remain morphosyntactically intransitive, they get the
ability to take an additional complement in the accusative. This complement is
optional. If present, its semantic role is that of standard of comparison (‘than ...’).
In the following example, the complement in the accusative is indexed (as /chā=/
‘1sg.acc’) on the inflected predicative phrase:(393)    [...] dăà chàuénḛʼe rǜ chānárü-̄ bûmāe ̄ [...]
         dă-à          chàu-énḛʼe=rǜ                 ̄ bû-māe ̄

Chapitre 5 – Morphologie flexionnelle du syntagme
prédicatif
    Ce chapitre décrit la morphologie flexionnelle du SP fini. La quasi-totalité des
morphèmes dont il est question ici sont des proclitiques qui sont directement pré-
posés au SP. La seule exception à cette généralisation est un suffixe qui s’attache à
l’autre extrémité du SP. Bon nombre de ces morphèmes ont pour fonction d’indexer
des participants ayant des fonctions syntaxiques diverses : sujet, objet, participant
en fonction accusative (lequel se distingue de l’objet (nucléaire) au niveau mor-
phosyntaxique et, dans une certaine mesure, au niveau sémantique), participant
bénéfactif(-maléfactif), participant locatif et participant objet partitif. D’autres
parmi ces proclitiques encodent la classe prédicative (ou « conjugaison », si l’on
veut) du SP auquel ils sont préposés. D’autres encore indiquent que le procès
s’accompagne d’un mouvement associé. Un certain nombre de ces morphèmes
sont des morphèmes fusionnels, qui accomplissent plusieurs de ces fonctions à la
fois. Ceux-ci contribuent à rendre jusqu’à un certain point fusionnelle la morpholo-
gie principalement agglutinante du tsma. Enfin, l’une des valeurs flexionnelles
encodées dans le SP – à savoir le tiroir verbal Subjonctif – compte parmi ses ex-
posants un processus d’alternance tonologique. Sa réalisation morphologique est,
en d’autres termes, de nature partiellement suprasegmentale.","[630, 631]"

3.5.2.6       Linker used as a type of definite determiner    Another case where the linker’s function is not to link the nominal constituent to
which it is procliticized to any preceding coreferential nominal constituent or index
is when it serves as a particular type of definite determiner used to signal that a
nominal constituent is intended to allow for the identification of a particular
referent within a set of referents already established as a main topic (implying
a contrast between that particular referent and the other referents in the set of
referents in question). This function of the linker is extremely reminiscent of the
use of the non-locative endophorics as a type of definite determiners (on which see
Section 3.4.3, p.225). In this function, the linker often marks a headless relative
clause, as in (254–255), or minimally a NP modified by a relative clause. It may
also mark a NP that does not contain any relative clause, as in (256).(254)                         ̂ rǜ yá yîà wôchi ̋nè tá g̃en̊ ágüʼ̋ è tá tíì-ĩ ̊ yá pŏra̋ʼè!” ñâʼü̃́ tüʼ̂ ü.̃̄

3.5.2.7       Past form of the linker procliticized to subordinate
              clauses   This section discusses the syntactic distribution of a morpheme /gá=/ that I
tentatively analyze as the linker in its past non-salientive inflectional form.
This morpheme is procliticized to apparently any type of subordinate clauses
to indicate that they refer to past processes. Example (257) shows this mor-
pheme /gá=/ procliticized to a circumstantial adverbial clause in /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’.
Examples (258–259) show it procliticized to complement clauses introduced by the
conjunction náʼa ∼ ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ (náʼa and ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ are two subdialectal variants of the same
conjunction; note that intriguingly, although these two variants generally have the268

Profil typologique du tikuna de San Martín de
Amacayacu
    La phonétique et la phonologie du tikuna de San Martín de Amacayacu (tsma)
présentent peu de complexité aux niveaux phonétique et phonologique. L’inventaire
des phonèmes segmentaux de la langue est relativement réduit (11 consonnes,
6 voyelles), et la réalisation phonétique de ces phonèmes ne présente pas de com-
plexité particulière. La structure syllabique segmentale est simple et peut être
schématisée comme suit : /(C)V(V)(ʔ)/. Les processus morphophonologiques de
la langue n’affectent que rarement les segments. La phonologie du tsma connaît
une complexité bien plus considérable au niveau suprasegmental. La question de
la position de l’accent tonique, qui tombe systématiquement sur la première syl-
labe de certaines catégories de morphèmes libres (pour la plupart d’entre eux) et
ne se déplace jamais, ne présente pas de difficulté particulière, pas plus que le trait
syllabique de nasalité phonologique, dont la présence dans certaines syllabes est
entièrement déterminée lexicalement et ne donne pas lieu à des phénomènes de
diffusion phonologique. La langue affiche, en revanche, un inventaire de tonèmes
très développé (10 tonèmes d’après l’analyse que je propose ici). Leur réalisation
phonétique repose en grande partie sur des propriétés de hauteur mélodique (pitch),
mais aussi sur des propriétés phonatoires. Chaque syllabe sous-jacente possède
son propre tonème lexical, lequel peut se retrouver affecté, dans certains contextes
morphosyntaxiques récurrents en discours, par des processus morphotonologiques
complexes.","[618, 619]"
"7.3       Non-clausal negation (negative existential
          indefinites)
    If a clause in the positive polarity contains existential300 indefinites (compa-
rable to English ‘something, somewhere, etc.’) that precede the main predica-
tive phrase, then the standard negator tãů ‘neg’ (on standard negation, see Sec-
tion 7.2.1 above) is not normally used to negate it. That clause’s existential indef-
inites are replaced by corresponding negative existential indefinites instead (com-
parable to English ‘nothing, nowhere, etc.’).301    One part of these negative existential indefinites is productively derived as sub-
ject participant relativizations including the negative existential verb root
tåʼu ‘be absent’ (on tåʼu ‘be absent’, see Section 7.2.2 above). Due to their nature
of relativizations, these inflect for nominal class. Their basic forms are listed in
  299
      The form timbu stands for local Sp. timbo ‘plastic barrel’. The Spanish word’s phonological form
is slightly adapted when inserted in a smat utterance by code-mixing (see Section 2.7.2.2).
  300
     Indefinites with semantic values other than existential (e.g. specific or universal indefinites)
do not have negative counterparts and do not display the behavior described in this section under
the scope of negation. See example (602) above for a case of negative clause featuring a (positive)
indefinite with a universal meaning (‘just any …’).
  301
     I do not have enough data to explore what happens in cases where within a single clause
there might be a conflict on whether an existential indefinite or the main verb should be the locus
for negative polarity, i.e. cases where an existential indefinite is involved in existential, topical-
locational, or privative negation (on these contexts of negation, see Sections 7.2.2–7.2.3), with
meanings such as ‘Wheat never existed in this region.’ or ‘I don’t have anything.’.",[531]

ally singular non-referential human participant (compare the English generic
pronoun one in e.g. One should respect one’s parents at all times).201 It is to underline
its broad semantic range that I have opted for calling this category of the language’s
persons system “fourth person”, instead of e.g. “first person plural inclusive”, which
would have been misleading.202    Examples (148–149) provide occurrences of a fourth person with a first per-
son plural inclusive meaning (see also (T127–T128), which may be contrasted
with (T137–T138) where the exact same referents are referred to as a first person
plural (exclusive)). Note that the plural marking of fourth person participants (e.g.
by means of /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ suffixed to an intransitive verb with a fourth person subject
in (148)) is in most cases optional and does not relate to the actual number of indi-
viduals subsumed within such participants, which may be two, as in (148), or more
than two, as in (149).","[211, 212]"

7.1     Overview
    This chapter deals with the morphemes and constructions that are resorted
to for setting a clause’s polarity to negative. The major functions related to
negative polarity and the morphosyntactic strategies applied to execute them are
briefly summarized in Table 49. These aspects, and a few more, are discussed in
detail in the next sections (the corresponding sections are referred to by numbers
in parentheses in Table 49). For a typological discussion of most of the functions
identified in Table 49, see van der Auwera & Krasnoukhova (2020). The struc-
ture of this entire chapter is inspired by Miestamo (2017) and van der Auwera &                                         517

above, although with a more literal translation), while in fact privative negation
is involved (which could have triggered the use of the specialized privative verb
/g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ in the pro-sentential part of the speaker’s answer), the less specific
negation marker tãů ‘neg’ is used instead of /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ (here under its irregular
combinatorial variant tåmā, for /tãu   ̊ =mā/ ‘neg-precisely’; see Section 7.5 above):

alized as tãů , but it also frequently occurs under its conservative variant tãů ʼü̃́

ples (644–645). By contrast, it does not seem to be able to occur under its innovative
denasalized variant tåu. This phonological conservatism of the pro-sentential use                                                                                          537

of tãů ‘neg’, as compared to its ordinary clausal use, is likely due to the fact that tãů
‘neg’ is normally left unstressed in the latter use, while it obligatorily bears stress
in the former.","[541, 542, 543]"

that this grammatical category is particularly common in the languages of the west-

that essentially contributes meanings such as ‘go/come (i.e. undergo a motion
unspecified for path) and perform the main process denoted by the lexical

glish ‘because’, although it may also mean ‘[not ...] but [instead ...]’ in specific
cases where it introduces a positive clause that serves as a correction of an imme-
diately preceding negative clause (see Section 7.8). For occurrences of the default
form ngērǘ (under its more typical unstressed form ērǘ; see below), see example

4.5.3      Valency operations with no dedicated
           exponence4.5.3.1     Passive construction    In smat, the more patient-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically
represented as a core object in the transitive construction) may by no means be
omitted from an utterance without the simultaneous addition of dedicated deriva-
tional morphology to the predicative phrase (on the antipassive suffixes /-ètà/, /-ē/
and /-tàe/̄ , which allow such an omission, see Section 4.5.1). By contrast, the more
agent-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically represented as a subject
in the transitive construction) may be omitted from an utterance without the addi-
tion of any specific derivational morphology to the predicative phrase. When this
occurs, the predicate merely becomes intransitive and the more patient-like
argument is promoted to the syntactic function of subject, i.e. the only core
argument position left in the resulting utterance. I call “passive construction” this
intransitive use of typically transitive predicative phrases with no derivational mor-
phology involved. Contrast the ordinary transitive construction in example (437a),
where both agent and patient referents are overtly mentioned, with the passive
construction in (437b), where only the patient referent is retained:(437)    a. Transitive construction:
            Chānā-chă.

sitive construction involving the same verb, specifically the verb root wü̏ ‘to scratch,
to write’ in (439) (with the passive construction coming first and the transitive con-
struction coming next) and the verb root yĕ ‘to chop down (smaller trees)’ in (440)
(with the two constructions occurring in the reverse order; note that the verb root
tūʼu ‘to fell (bigger trees)’ at the end of (440) also appears in a passive construction):(439)   Ná-nŭʼà, chôʼrǖ pōpēràgú. Mā ná-wü̏ ì especie. Especie de plátano—pōʼi ̋—

"7.2.3         Privative negation
    Another context in which the mere adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ is not normally avail-
able as a strategy to convert a positive clause into its corresponding negative clause
is when possessive predication is involved (on positive possessive predication, see
Sections 4.2.5.3 and 4.3.3.6). In other words, a clause that predicates possession
by means of the possessive predicative suffix /-ã/̰ and/or the possessive verb ã̄ ‘to
have’ in its positive polarity (e.g. /chā=âirű-ã/̰ ‘I have a dog’ or /chā=ã-̄ pátā/
‘I have a house’) can normally not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? /tãu      ̊
                                               ̊ chā=ã-̄ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a house’).

is regularly used instead and no other marker of negation appears in the clause
(e.g. /chā=g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ âirű-ã/̰ ‘I don’t have a dog’ or /chā=g̃e-̊ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a
house’).298    As is regularly the case when incorporation of a nominal constituent into the
predicative phrase occurs (on incorporation, see Section 4.2.5), if the referent
whose being possessed is negated is referred to with a bound noun, then the priva-
tive predicative word takes on the form /g̃e-̊ /bound.noun (not.have-bound.noun),
as in examples (617–618). By contrast, if that referent is referred to with a full NP
(and with an independent noun in particular), then the privative predicative phrase
takes on the structure /g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ NP-ã/̰ (not.have-gen NP-poss), as in (619).","[529, 530]"
"    Given the binary organization of part of the smat system of FGC suffixes in
pairs of suffixes respectively encoding the positive value and the negative value
of specific types of topological relations (e.g. /-ku̽chi ́, -ku̽/ [+containment] vs
/-ʼV̽chi ́, -ʼü̃̽/ [-containment]; /-V̄chi ̀/ [+propinquity] vs /-gàchi ̀/ [-propinquity]),
one may wonder whether /-yé/, if it is rightly classified as a FGC suffix, could not
be, in fact, the counterpart of the plurilocal suffix /-a̽/ (on which see the previous
section). Perhaps /-yé/ and /-a̽/ respectively denote the opposite values [singular]
and [plural] of a more general type of topological relation that one might label
[topological number]. If this hypothesis is correct, then the semantic contribution
of /-yé/ in (312) would not be to indicate that the skein was cut in its middle part
(so as to split in two halves of approximately equal size), but that it was cut in a
single cut (so as to split in two parts and no more than two). More data on this
suffix are needed to confirm or invalidate this speculative but plausible hypothesis.",[315]

function as a more emphatic alternative for the standard negator tãu       ̊ ‘neg’

first one is negative, while the next ones remain as they would be in the correspond-
ing positive clause. This is illustrated in the following example:(631)   Tåʼúgù mā g̃èʼta̋ nà-ũʼ̂ ü̃́ […].

within a given clause, and more specifically on the first available locus. This
rule equally applies across different types of negation strategies in cases where
they could in principle co-occur, e.g. when topical-locational negation (on topical-
locational negation, see Section 7.2.2) and an existential indefinite post-posed to
it co-occur within the same clause, as in the following example:(632)   […] nà-tåʼúʼü̃́ gá åkǘ […].        nà=tåʼú-ʼü̃́                                   gá=åkǘ

"    A rarer but stronger construction used for reinforcing negation can be syntacti-
cally interpreted as negation focus (‘It is not the case that …’). In this construction,
the non predicative negative word in a clause (i.e. tãů ‘neg’ or a negative existen-
tial indefinite) appears in the regular position of focalized constituents (focalized.
constituent inflected.copula (lk=)clause.in.sbjv-sub; on focalization, see
Section 5.2.6, p.426). From a pragmatic perspective, this construction is often
used when contradiction of a previous statement, an assumption, or a wish is
implied (‘[Contrary to what I/you/they said/believed/want,] negative.clause’).
This construction is illustrated in the following examples:(642)                                       ̃́

it is part of. As such, /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’ cannot serve to emphasize negation,
which normally has scope over it, as in example (603) above, unless it occurs on
the negative word itself, as in (617) and (641) above.308

     I have no simple explanation for why in the following examples /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’, while it is
suffixed to the negative words themselves, does not intensify negation as expected, but rather seems                                                                                                   535

tional noun /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ it contains would have lead to predict it to also be able to
mean *‘nowhere’) features, as in (627), a free variant tågù (probably a phonological
reduction from tåʼúgù itself; on the origin of the variant tågù, see also Section 7.5

general impossibility (see e.g. (T117)).","[534, 535]"
"    To reduce the toneme inventory of smat in stressed syllables, a second direction
is to hypothesize that certain tones are the mere surface realization of what
is underlyingly a combination of tonemes. This has been done by L. Anderson
(1959:92, 118), who claims that the Cushillococha Tikuna reflexes of the smat
tones [52 ], [43 ], and [31 ] are the realization of sequences of two level tonemes linked
to a single syllable. He thus analyzes these three Cushillococha Tikuna tones, which
he transcribes as [51 ], [43 ], and [31 ], as representing the underlying combinations102

"    Tãů ‘neg’, a phonologically anomalous word in that its only syllable combines
an oral onset together with a nasal nucleus, is likely to have arisen etymologically
from a phonetic reduction of /tåʼú-ʼü̃́/ ‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ (lit. ‘(a/the)
non-existing’), i.e. the regular subject participant relativization in the non-salien-
tive nominal class of the negative existential verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. /Tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/ ‘be.
absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ is in fact still used in its unreduced form to express meanings

"    However, in the speech of most speakers, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is regularly used in declara-
tive main clauses to present a process as constituting a new, salient step within
a temporal sequence of processes. sbjv-ʼü̃́ is then resorted to as a discursive de-
vice that allows the speaker to explicitly construct a clear temporal axis along which
major steps are grammatically signaled as such as they are being mentioned. Such
uses of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses could be roughly glossed by ‘at that
point, …’, as was done in the translation of example (448d) above. By contrast,
non-sequential processes, or minor sequential processes that the speaker does
not want to present as sequenced, are referred to with predicative phrases in ind.
In other words, predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ essentially correspond to those that
involve what I call advancement of narrative time ([+ant]), while predica-
tive phrases in ind essentially correspond to those that do not involve advance-
ment of narrative time ([-ant]). An important consequence is that predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses may not be uttered in a different
order without typically implying a different sequence for the processes referred to,
i.e. the ordering of [+ant] forms conditions the semantic interpretation of the
processes referred to. By contrast, predicative phrases in ind in declarative main
clauses may be uttered in a different order with no direct implication as to the se-
quence of the processes referred to, i.e. the ordering of [-ant] forms has no effect
on the semantic interpretation of the processes referred to. Note that the order-
ing of [-ant] forms does, by contrast, condition the discursive—more specifically,
the rhetorical—interpretation of utterances, as it obviously has direct effects on
the order in which the information is delivered and construed and the way it is
rhetorically organized.259
  259
      Thus in example (451) below, which contains three main clauses in ind, the enacted speaker
chooses to first make a more generic announcement (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) and then pro-
ceeds to make a more specific elaboration on it in the next two utterances (‘I’ll shoot some brown
woolly monkeys. I’ll go woolly-monkey-hunting.’). With the exact same semantic meaning, the
first utterance (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) could presumably have been uttered last, but then that
semantically more generic utterance would have been construed as a summary restatement of the
more specific announcement made in the previous two utterances, yielding a different rhetorical
structure from the one actually at play in (451). Likewise, in (450) below, the ordering of the three
clauses in ind in the answer (‘I’ve shot a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t
find it.’) could in principle be altered (as in e.g. ‘A beautiful tére̋ parrot has fallen down here, but
I can’t find it, [in fact] I’ve shot it.’) with no consequences as to their semantic interpretation, but

                                    5.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
    Typical discourse genres where the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is exploited are
narratives (whether set in a remote past and unrelated to the discourse partici-
pants—myths, legends, tales, etc.—or set in a relatively recent past and related to
the discourse participants—life stories, anecdotes, etc.) and procedural discourse
(cooking recipes, descriptions of craft techniques, chronologically-ordered descrip-
tions of the typical activities carried out in a given period of time, etc.). In these
discourse genres, while predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are used to orderly unroll the
series of major events (or steps to be conducted), predicative phrases in ind are gen-
erally employed with one or several of the following six main discursive functions
(the simple illustrative contexts of use in parentheses are made up examples that
parallel actual occurrences in my corpus; actual examples are provided below):260    – locating a major event in space or time (e.g. ‘The next day came.ind. Then
      he went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ into the jungle.’);    – mentioning preliminary minor events (e.g. ‘He eventually spotted.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a
      monkey. He came closer.ind and he shot.sbjv-ʼü̃́ it.’);    – recapitulating a previous major event (e.g. ‘And then he came down.sbjv-ʼü̃́.
      So, he came down.ind, and then he started.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to speak.’);261
such alterations would affect the rhetorical relations that bind them into a small discourse unit.
In practice, in (450), the rhetorical principle that guides the ordering of the clauses in ind under
scrutiny is temporal iconicity, but the use of ind in these clauses indicates that establishing a clear
temporal axis is not essential to the purposes of the enacted speaker at that moment.
  260
     Interestingly, when they fulfill one of the first three functions in this list, main declarative
clauses containing a predicative phrase in ind are often explicitly topicalized by means of a topic
marker (/=i ̀/ ‘contr.top’ in non-past contexts or /=gá/ ‘pst’ in past contexts) attached at their
right edge (as in examples (454a) and (455e) below). This clause-level topicalization process could
in fact be argued to turn these clauses into near-dependent clauses (as opposed to genuinely inde-
pendent main clauses). Note further that all of the six functions in this list are somehow related to
topical (i.e. already known or backgrounded) information, as opposed to the more focal (i.e. un-
known or foregrounded) information typically conveyed by declarative main clauses containing a
predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́.
  261
      The use of such recapitulating clauses for discourse cohesion is frequent in narratives and proce-
dural discourse in smat. These recapitulating clauses are of two major formal and functional types.
Some include the predicative phrase of the recapitulated clause more or less verbatim (“recapitulat-
ing linkage” proper in Aikhenvald (2019)’s terminology). These verbatim (or specific) recapitulating
clauses typically provide linkage from one sentence to the next within a single paragraph and often
imply that the two main processes referred to are temporally close to each other (see e.g. exam-
ples (454a–454b) below). Other much more formulaic recapitulating clauses feature an anaphoric
word referring to the processes to be recapitulated (/ngē-mà/ ‘med.ns-anaph’ in past or non-past
                                                                                                   401
5. Inflection of the predicative phrase
    – initiating a series of major events (e.g. ‘Once upon a time, a man went.ind
      into the jungle. There he found.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a deer.’);    – elaborating on specific aspects of a major event occurring at the same ref-
      erence time (e.g. ‘And then they had.sbjv-ʼü̃́ dinner. They chatted.ind, they
      drank.ind [i.e. while eating]. Then they went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to bed.);    – describing participants of a major event (e.g. ‘The canoe was large.ind.’).","[405, 406, 407]"

4.2.5.3      Pseudo-incorporation in possessive predication    Possessive predication of participants expressed as bound nouns exclusively op-
erates through a construction that is formally identical with bound noun in-
corporation and appears to incorporate the bound noun to the verb roots ã̄ ‘to
have’ (positive possessive predication) or g̃e-̊ ‘not have’ (negative possessive—
or privative—predication, on which see Section 7.2.3). Possessive predication of
participants expressed as NPs may similarly operate through a construction that is
formally identical with NP incorporation and involves the same two verb roots,
although in the case of participants expressed as NPs an alternative construction
involving non-verbal predication is available, and apparently preferred over NP in-
corporation to ã̄ or g̃e-̊ (on this alternative construction, see Section 4.3.3.6). Note,
however, that the incorporation-like constructions employed for possessive predi-
cation are not, strictly speaking, genuine incorporation given that their possessee
participant cannot be extracted from ã̄ or g̃e-̊ so as to be expressed as a separate,
syntactically independent nominal constituent. Furthermore, from a syntactico-
semantic perspective, these incorporation-like constructions do not quite fit with
any of the three functional types identified in the previous section. For these rea-
sons, I consider them as cases of pseudo-incorporation, rather than incorporation
proper.","[331, 332]"

preted as partially lexicalized forms replacing tåʼúʼü̃́ in cases where it has a
very general meaning ‘nothing’. This group of negative existential indefinites is
morphologically built as combinations of /tåʼú-/ ‘nothing’303 with a case suffix or a
relational noun. The ones attested in my data are listed in Table 51 (but note that
there is likely to be a few more than these, with other case suffixes or relational
nouns).304   By contrast to the previously discussed negative existential indefinites, which
can function as modifiers or modified heads, these /tåʼú/-based negative existential
indefinites always constitute entire arguments on their own, i.e. they may not
modify, nor be modified by, any other word. The following example illustrates
the ordinary use of one of them, /tåʼú-ʼǖ̃/ ‘be.absent\sbjv?-acc’:
  303
      This morpheme /tåʼú-/ ‘nothing’ probably comes from a former zero-derived nominalization of
the verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. Note, however, that by this etymological interpretation /tåʼú-/’s current
shape would appear to be tonologically slightly irregular, and one would have expected a form
*/tåʼu-/ (i.e. a form *[ˈt ̞aː34 ʔu 3 ...], featuring a tone [3 ], not [4 ], on its second surface syllable)
instead.
  304
      Anderson & Anderson (2016:218-219) also register the related forms tax2 u2 ma3 ‘nothing’ (i.e.
/tåʼú=mā/ ‘nothing=precisely’ in my analysis), tax2 u2 cax5 ma3 ‘for nothing’ (i.e. /tåʼú-ka̰=mā/
‘nothing-cause=precisely’) and tax2 u2 cü2 rü2 wa1 ‘cannot’ (i.e. /tåʼú-kǘrǘwa̋/ ‘nothing-since?’) in
the Cushillococha Tikuna variety. These, and possibly more, might also exist in the smat variety.","[532, 533, 534]"
