     Prohibitives can be directed at either a second or third person. The prohibitive
markers are kose ‘lest’ initially, and mani ‘PHB’ finally.2 They are associated with
status marking appropriate to the context. Appropriate status subject markers are used
for the circumstance, i.e. irrealis for something that hasn’t been done. Second person
prohibitives are normally realis. This may be because they are directed to a person
involved in doing or about to do the forbidden activity. All other examples of
negative imperatives in the current data corpus are irrealis.
       (5) Nanu kose meli-i-le             wa-be      mani.
             3.PN lest river-LOC-GL go-3S.IR PHB

             ‘You mustn’t say to your sister…’9.4 Interrogatives and question words
9.4.1 Question words
    Three bases are used in formation of question words: ake, gle and ine. Suffixes
are freely added to these bases to form the question words.
    The basic meaning of ake is ‘how’. It contains the two morphemes a ‘do’, and ke,
which appears to be the same as is used in demonstrative forms. Ake’s verbal base
explains its function as questioning a verb or arguments thereof. Common question
words formed from ake are given in (9) below:
       (9) ake            ‘how’
             akei         ‘where’ (how-LOC)2
    Refer to discussion in §5.3.3
166                                                             Kwomtari Grammar             akake        ‘how many’ (<ake-ake ‘how-how’)
             akelu        ‘what kind’ (how-NN)
             akeke        ‘how’ (intensified)
             akeni        ‘which’ (<ake-geni ‘how-thing’)
             akenifi      ‘where’ (which-LOC)
    Gle means ‘what’ and in general applies to nouns. Its relation to the negating
particle glei is unclear. Pronouns formed from gle appear in (10):
      (10) gle              ‘what, which’
              glefe         ‘why’ (what-RSN)
              glefu         ‘from where’ (what-ABL)
              glele         ‘what’ (what-GL)
              glei          ‘where’ (what-LOC)
              glisou        ‘what thing’ (<gle-yesou ‘what-thing’)
              gleme         ‘what place’ (what-CER?/D.DUR?)
      Ine means ‘who’ and questions human entities.
        (11) ine          ‘who, whoever’
             inepane      ‘who (plural)’
             inele        ‘whom’ (who-GL)
             inelu        ‘whose’ (who-NN)
    Content questions are formed by replacing the item in question with one of the
interrogative words listed above. Examples appear below:
      (12) Fie-fo-ie,        “Fori akei-e?”
             ask-3S.O-1S.R pig      where-EXC
             ‘I asked him, “Where’s the pig?”’
      (13) Une ake-i           wa-la-lu?
             2NPL what-LOC go-P.DUR-2S.R
             ‘Where are you going?’
      (14) Akeke le-bile?

             ‘What shall we do?’
      (15) Une-bo            glefe pruele-mo-lu?
             2NPL-FOC.DEC why flee.P-2P.R-NN
             ‘Why did you (both) run away?’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                               167     (16) Une glefe funa-lu?
          2NPL why hit-2S.R
          ‘Why did you hit (him)?’
     (17) Ine eete-geni fo-ri       yesou  tu-lee?
          who this-thing eat-NOM something cook-3S.R
          ‘Who cooked this food?’
     (18) Une bole ine-le       fane-lu?
          2NPL meat who-GL give.S-2S.R
          ‘Whom did you give the meat to?’
     (19) Eete-geni klifu ine-lu?
          this-thing dog who-NN
          ‘Whose dog is this?’
9.4.2 Use of question words as indefinite words
    Question words may also be used as indefinite words, though only a few
examples of this occur in the current corpus of data. These examples are ine
‘whoever’, glemegleme ‘whatever place’. All other occurrences of question words are
in questions. The following examples show ine ‘whoever’ and glemegleme ‘whatever
place’ used in their indefinite sense.
     (20) Te lufwa ine               inali ari nebue
            FOC man whoever wife child now
          ame teri-la-lee-lu           glei mwi-fe      wa-bile,     mwa,

          wokoo-i       la-la-bile.
          village-LOC remain-P.DUR-1/3P.IR
          ‘Whichever men have newly pregnant wives, they can’t go for vines, they
          must stay in the village.’
     (21) Gleme-gleme wa-lee menegu-tu-me

          ‘He’ll go to some place and he’ll be holding her with his thoughts.’
168                                                                        Kwomtari Grammar9.4.3 Polar questions
     Polar questions are formed with pe (see §3.1.6). These are indistinguishable from
statements like “possibly…”3. Pe follows each constituent the speaker focuses on
with his or her question.
      (22) Weife glase        le-te-bile        pe?
             DU     goggles do-3P.O-1/3P.IR POSB
             ‘Shall we two go goggling? (looking for crocodiles)’
             [Or: ‘we’ll possibly go goggling’]
       The action (the whole clause) is questioned.
        (23) Ei! Fori bofu             pe?
               hey! pig another POSB
               ‘Is it another pig?’ Or ‘It might be another pig.’
   A pig is definitely present - whether it is the same or another is what is being
questioned.
      (24) Nuboue pe        fwi      una-nu geni            pulufo-fe?
            good      POSB coconut 2.PN-NN something get-1S.IR
            ‘May I get your coconuts?’ Or ‘It might be OK for me to get your
            coconuts.’
       The question relates to whether it would be good to get the coconuts.
        (25) Une gife          le-o-la-lee            pe?
              2NPL hunger do-1/2S.O-P.DUR-3S.R POSB
              ‘Are you hungry?’ Or ‘Maybe you’re hungry.’
       The event of being hungry (the clause) is questioned.
        (26) Mene pe         Tomas pe       wa-be?
              1NPL POSB Tomas POSB go-3S.IR
              ‘Shall I or Thomas go?’ Or ‘I or Thomas will go (maybe I, maybe
              Thomas will go).’
       The subject constituent is questioned.
        (27) Teti        pe? We, teti          pai.
              enough POSB yes enough PRB
              ‘Is that all? Yes, that’s probably all.’3
    Other than perhaps by intonation pattern – this would need checking.
                 10. Discourse level    Discourses can be divided into two types: those that are iconically ordered, and
those that are conceptually oriented.
    Within the first type are narratives - both personal and ancestral (legends), and
procedures. This type has many long sentences, with clauses linked by the verb final
suffixes -ke and -i, fixing the events firmly in time. Conjunctions other than te are
rarely used, except tetu ‘then’ which occurs frequently in procedural texts. Tail-head
linkage is often used, where the final verb of one sentence is repeated as the first verb
of the next. Narrative texts are given realis status, while procedural texts take 2nd
person irrealis subject/status markers. Narrative texts use the different durative
aspects for foregrounding and backgrounding of material. Proximal durative,
normally used (with realis status) to mark present, occurs in narratives to mark
backgrounded durative events. Distal durative, which correctly indicates the real time
of the event (in the past), occurs with durative events which are more focal to the
narration.
     The second type of discourses include descriptions, explanations and hortatory
texts. These types make greater use of the conjunctions tete ‘therefore’, and tefe ‘so’.
Sentences are generally much shorter than in narrative or procedural texts and many
are simple sentences. Descriptions take realis status; explanations and hortatory texts
fluctuate between stating facts, using realis status, and predicting consequences, with
irrealis status.
    The text given in the appendix is a personal narrative.","[174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179]"

Papers in the series Data Papers on Papua New Guinea Languages express the authors’
knowledge at the time of writing. They normally do not provide a comprehensive
treatment of the topic and may contain analyses which will be modified at a later stage.
However, given the large number of undescribed languages in Papua New Guinea, SIL-
PNG feels that it is appropriate to make these research results available at this time.

                         1. Introduction1.1 Language setting
    Kwomtari is a Papuan (i.e. non-Austronesian) language spoken in Sandaun (West
Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea. Its approximately 800 speakers are
traditionally hunter-gatherers, who inhabit six villages in the interior of the province.
The language region occupies about 400 square kilometres, and is located between 40
and 60 kilometres east of the Indonesian border (see Map 1).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

Kwomtari Grammar                                                                    171    e. Durative aspect in complex sentences
    The meanings involved here have only been tentatively proposed in this paper
and further clarification is needed. Certainly a difference between the two suffixes -la
‘P.DUR’ and -me ‘D.DUR’ should be obtained.
    f. Particle analysis
     There is a need to more fully analyse and explain the uses of -me, -i, -ke and some
of the other particles.
    g. Polar questions and pe ‘POSB’
    Polar questions formed by the possibility particle pe (POSB) are indistinguishable
from statements like “possibly…” It may be that an intonation contour distinguishes
them from statements. Also, the function of pe ‘POSB’ in the following construction is
not clear.
       (1) Fori pe        a-te-ne-lu-fe              lufwa a-te-ne.
            pig POSB do-3P.O-1/3P.R-NN-RSN man do-3P.O-1/3P.R
            ‘It wasn’t pigs that did it – it was men (e.g. messed up the garden).’
    h. Morpheme -tie
   This morpheme, whose meaning is unknown, has been mentioned in §5.6. It may
have an exclamatory or modal function.
    i. Causative impersonal constructions
    These should be further examined. They were discussed briefly in §4.1.4.
    j. Discourse analysis
    Discourse analysis largely remains to be done. Uses of tail-head linkage, other
links, etc. should help in the process of analysing what features each discourse type
manifests. The discourse types are iconically ordered discourses (e.g. narrative,
procedural) and thematically oriented discourses. (e.g. descriptive, explanatory and
hortatory). There is some preliminary marking on some of the texts we have that
gives some clues.
                      Appendix: Text
    The following text was written by Joseph Sukwari on December 3, 1996. The
bolded text is the text as originally written, prior to analysis of each morpheme.","[180, 181, 182]"
"3.1 Set 1 – Postpositions expressing modal outlook
3.1.1 Focus indices
    The postpositions indexing focus, found (so far) only on pronouns in direct
speech, alter the degree of focus of the whole clause.
    The postposition -ko ‘increased focus’ marks surprise or increased importance.
This is illustrated in examples (1) - (3):
       (1) Mene-ko           asulu      lufwa pai ne-ne!
              1NPL-FOC.INC sorcery man PRB say-1/3P.R
              ‘We thought (you were) probably a sorcerer!’
                                          78
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                                           79           (2) Mene-ko          mareteku mwi le-fo-bile.
               1NPL-FOC.INC all            track do-3S.O-1/3P.IR
               ‘We will track it.’
           (3) Nanu-ko         fori feti pai ne-lee.
               3.PN-FOC.INC pig very PRB say-3S.R
               ‘He thought it was a real pig.’ (It wasn’t.)
    The postposition -bo ‘decreased focus’ marks ridicule or decreased importance.
This is illustrated in examples (4) and (5):
       See example (6) below and the following:
         (4) Une-bo           glefe rie-lu?
              2NPL-FOC.DEC why come-2S.R
              ‘Why did you (of all people) come?’
         (5) Une-bo           glefe pruele-mo-lu?
              2NPL-FOC.DEC why flee.P-2P.R-NN
              ‘Why did you (both) run away?’
    Example (6) contrasts between the noun phrase marked with -bo and the more
focal one marked with -ko:
       (6) Mene-bo         inalilufwa feti pai ne-ie,    eete-ko
           1NPL-FOC.DEC people        very PRB say-1S.R this-FOC.INC
                 fwi       falulu, blenilu, totulu, lilu         yekrune-ne.
                 coconut dry,       green, unripe, flower fall.P-1/3P.R
                 ‘I thought it was really people, but these are coconuts that fell down.’
3.1.2 Contrastive focus1 -te
    The postposition -te ‘FOC’ contrasts the marked entity to others. There must be
other entities for it to compare to. For example, if two or three men went hunting and
one shot something special, that one could refer to himself as menete when saying1
    [Editors’ note] In this section and §6.1.1, Spencer originally used the words ‘topic’ and ‘topical’ in all
     places where ‘focus’ and ‘focal’ now appear. The change was made because the use of ‘topic’ in the
     original manuscript was inconsistent with the general usage in the literature (e.g. Payne 1997:270-
     271). The term ‘focus’ can be taken as referring generally to the new information the speaker wishes
     the addressee to pay attention to (cf Payne 1997:266-271). Apart from terminology, Spencer’s analysis
     is unchanged.
80                                                                     Kwomtari Grammarthat he shot it. However, if he had gone hunting alone, he could use meneko, but not
menete. Example (7) illustrates this usage of -te with a personal pronoun:
       (7) Mene-te metie sabele sabele bule-tu                    feti kuta-ie-ke
             1NPL-FOC really huge huge basket-COM very tie.up-1S.R-SEQ
             teri-ie-o!
             MOT.TOWARD-1S.R-VOC
             ‘I (in contrast to the others) tied up a huge bundle and brought it.’
     In (8), there is an implicit contrast between the outside of the tree and its inside.
The contrast is called up by the association between outside and inside and the
contrastive focus on ‘outside’:
       (8) Puma-fu-te             falu le-lee-lu-le      feta-la-lu.
             outside-ABL-FOC dry do-3S.R-NN-GL see-P.DUR-2S.R
             ‘You see the outside (bark of tree) that is dry (in contrast to the inside
             which is raw).’
   In example (9), te is used in conjunction with the goal postposition to mark a
noun not in focal position:
      (9) Mene fori lufwa ri-tu               a-lee-lu      geni-te-le
            1NPL pig man body-COM do-3S.R-NN thing-FOC-GL
            prafe-ie!
            shoot.S-1S.R
            ‘I shot an extraordinary thing – a pig with a man’s body!’
3.1.3 Approximation -se
    The postposition -se ‘APR’ occurs following the -i postposition, marking a
location fairly close to the speaker. It is most commonly used with deictics, as in (10):
      (10) Eete-i-se          teme-e-la!
             here-LOC-APR stand.S -2S.IR-EXC
             ‘Stand here!’
    It also occurs in deictic adverbs: se, eese, ese, same (see the discussion in §5.4). It
commonly occurs in the words iteise ‘this approximate location’ and akeise
‘approximately where?’
     An unusual use of -se appears in (11), where it is used to form a new noun:
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                     81     (11) kuli-se
          leg-APR
          ‘leech’
3.1.4 Distributive marker -po
     The suffix -po primarily attaches to verbs and indicates distribution over plural
agents or goals (discussed in §4.2.4). A second use of -po is documented in only a
few scattered examples in the present corpus. It functions as a plural marker occurring
before another suffix (e.g. -tu ‘COM’, -mai ‘on top’), to pluralise or indicate
distribution over the marked noun phrase. This is shown in (12), where -po indicates
that the action occurs on top of multiple mats:
      (12) Yeboe-po-mai        fati-ne.
             mat-DST-on.top put.S-1/3P.R
             ‘We put it on the mats.’
   In example (13), the focus marker te is optional, and po-tu refers back to the
bundles of leaves mentioned in the previous clause.
     (13) Gwaie          tuolu lofu-tu      fue-lu-ke        (te)-po-tu
            Cassowary egg leaf-COM tie-2S.R-SEQ (FOC)-DST-COM
            fale-lu-ke…
            get.S-2S.R-SEQ
            ‘You tie the cassowary eggs up with leaves, and pick each of them up
            with the leaves (around it) and …’
     (14) Na-o-lee,            “Eie, aroo-po-tu         mwi le-fo-bile!”
            say-1/2S.O-3S.R EXC rain-DST-COM track do-3S.O-1/3P.IR
            ‘He said to me, “No, let’s track it in the rain!”’
3.1.5 Diminutive -keke
    The postposition -keke is a diminutive modifying nouns (usually adjectival in
nature) which occur in the predicate of descriptive clauses (see §7.1.3). Although it is
a dimunitive, it actually has the effect of focusing attention on the quality being
expressed.
     (15) nuboue-keke
            good-DIM
            ‘quite good’ (in answer to an enquiry after someone’s earache)
82                                                                                 Kwomtari Grammar         (16) seli-keke le-la-ne-i,
              big-DIM do-P.DUR-1/3P.R-SIM
              ‘when they’ve become quite big…’
         (17) Bie, kaisekli-keke le-po-le!
              first strength-DIM do-DST-2S.IR
              ‘First, you make (your arms and legs) strong.’
3.1.6 Markers of epistemic judgement2
     The postposition pe ‘POSB’ is a discrete word expressing the speaker’s doubt,
along with his belief that the occurrence of the event is within the realm of possibility.
It is very close in meaning to pai ‘PRB’. Both are epistemic judgements (Palmer
2001:7-9). Pe indicates a weak assertion of probability and pai a strong assertion.
       Pe is used in polar questions (§9.4.3), following each questioned constituent.
        (18) Marena pe?
               truth       POSB
               ‘Is it true?’
        (19) Glei rame-le-lee,          afwi-tu    pe      mwa pe.
               not know-do-3S.R trail-COM POSB no                  POSB
               ‘It didn’t know if (the ridge had) a trail or not.’

   The following example shows an interesting construction, though I am not sure
what functions pe and -fe have in the clause.

            ‘It wasn’t pigs that did it–it was men (e.g. messed up the garden).’
    Pai is also a discrete word having a similar function to pe. However, pai indicates
that the speaker considers this information has a strong probability of occurring or
being true.
      (27) Nanu metie asulu           lufwa pai.

    As (29) shows, pai gives the opinion of the subject of the clause, not necessarily
the opinion of the speaker:

epistemic judgement on the part of the speaker. Unlike pe and pai, -me expresses
complete certainty of the facts.3

            bathe.S-NOM-CER do-3S.R
            ‘He’s washing thoroughly (all over).’
    The suffix -me sometimes occurs reduplicated as -meme for extra emphasis, as in
(33):
      (33) Lufwa mareteku-me-me ari mareteku-me-me
            man     all-RED-CER        boy all-RED-CER

            ‘Truly absolutely all the men and boys dispersed…’
    The suffix -me also occurs on nominalised clauses, as in examples (34) and (35).
In this situation, the -lu suffix (which normally acts as the nominaliser) may be
dropped:
      (34) Rute-lu yalu-le                      fati-ne-lu-me         le-lee-ke…

    Note that the meaning of -me is not fully understood and may be broader than is given in this section.
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                   853.2 Set 2 – Postpositions relating one noun to another
3.2.1 Noun phrase marker/nominaliser -lu
     This postposition is used in many environments and I am unsure of its central
underlying meaning. I have glossed it NN, a noun phrase marker or nominaliser. NN
reflects its primary function, which is to relate nouns to nouns.
    The postposition -lu marks animate possessors, as examples (36) and (37) show.
     (36) Samuele-lu ite
           Samuel-NN house
           ‘Samuel’s house’
     (37) Gote-lu kaisekli
           God-NN strength
           ‘God’s strength’
     In modifier-modified compound nouns, where the first noun serves as a specifier
for the second noun, -lu is suffixed to the second noun, as in examples (38) and (39).
Adjectives (§2.1.3) tend to be the last item in a noun phrase, and in this position
always end in -lu (40). In each of these cases, -lu appears to indicate the terminal
member of a noun phrase.
       (38) fwi       nagli-lu
            coconut base-NN
            ‘base of the coconut (tree)’
       (39) maie ai-lu
            egg house-NN
            ‘bird’s nest’
       (40) beni     wi-lu
            banana ripe-NN
            ‘ripe banana’
   When a noun phrase involves an animate being, a way (ami), or a story (na), the
behaviour seems to be different, with the adjective more often coming before the
noun:
     (41) rame-lu          lufwa
           knowledge-NN man
           ‘knowledgeable man’
86                                                                   Kwomtari Grammar    The suffix -lu acts to nominalise clauses. In this role it marks relative clauses,
normally preceding the noun that it modifies, due to its weight (see examples (42) and
(43)).
       (42) afoo yefu         kuka-la-lee-lu          sineku
            grub grub.type chop-P.DUR-3S.R-NN sound
            ‘the sound of him chopping for grubs’
       (43) Gwaie-tu           klifu-tu   yekrune-ne-lu      na.
            cassowary-COM dog-COM fall.P-1/3P.R-NN account
            ‘Account of a cassowary and a dog falling.’
    Examples (44) and (45) show clauses functioning as complete noun phrases, with
suffixation. In these cases -lu precedes other suffixes that relate the nominalised
expression to the predicate:
      (44) Lie gaga ne-la-lee-lu-fi                  sina-te-le.
             sun heat say-P.DUR-3S.R-NN-LOC put-3S.O-2S.IR
             ‘You will put them in a place that is sunny.’
      (45) Meni-i       feti lai-la-ne-lu-le                brini krine-po-lu-ke
             hole-LOC very stay-P.DUR-1/3P.R-NN-GL thorn cut-DST-2S.R-SEQ
            te-tu       glie-po-le.
            FOC-COM pull-DST-2S.IR
            ‘The ones (grubs) that are right inside, after you have cut thorns, then
            you’ll (use them to) pull them (grubs) out.’
3.2.2 Comitative -tu
    The postposition -tu is used in a comitative sense to conjoin two noun phrases
acting as subject. (See §3.3.4 for the related use of this postposition on nouns in the
predicate.) The suffix -tu only expresses dual accompaniment. It occurs sometimes
with the dual pronoun weife. Sometimes both nouns are marked (46), and sometimes
only the second (47). The resulting conjoined noun phrase causes the subject marker
on the verb to be plural. Where both noun phrases are marked, they are considered of
equal importance. Where only the second is marked, it is of secondary importance –
an accompanier to the first.
      (46) Gwaie-tu            klifu-tu    yekrune-ne-lu     na.
            cassowary-COM dog-COM fall.P-1/3P.R-NN account
            ‘Account of a cassowary and a dog falling.’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                       87     (47) Mene weife Nicke-tu       Yetomi wokoo-i-le
          1NPL DU      Nick-COM Yetomi village-LOC-GL

          go-1/3P.R-NN account
          ‘Account of Nick and I going to Yetomi.’
    Example (48) shows a metaphorical extension of the comitative usage to describe
a subject being accompanied by an emotion:
      (48) Wofri-wofri-tu wa-lee.
             RED-fear-COM go-3S.R
             ‘He went in (lit. with) great fear.’3.3 Set 3 – Postpositions relating a noun to the clausal
    predicate
3.3.1 Locative -i, -fi
    The postpositions -i, -fi both indicate the location of the marked noun phrase in
space or time. They are both allomorphs of one morpheme, -i occurring more
frequently. Words borrowed from Tok Pisin can host either allomorph; any of the
forms in (49) or (50) is acceptable:
     (49) a. hefene-fi
                 heaven-LOC
                 ‘in heaven’ (TP long heven)
            b. hefene-i
                  heaven-LOC
                 ‘in heaven’ (TP long heven)
     (50) a. stua-fi
                 store-LOC
                ‘at/in the store’ (TP long stua)
            b. stua-i
                  store-LOC
                 ‘at/in the store’ (TP long stua)
    Some vernacular nouns ending in u or i obligatorily occur with -i, but other nouns
ending in -u or -i may occur with -fi. The dialect of Kwomtari and Mango villages
always uses the -fi allomorph. It appears that the Baifeni dialect is also shifting to -fi
88                                                                   Kwomtari Grammarfor nouns ending in -u or -i to avoid the morphophonemic shifts that they require
when -i is suffixed4.
    The morpheme -i seems to have a general meaning of anchoring an entity to a
location in space and time. This is evident in its use as a locative postposition, and as
a clause-final marker of simultaneous action -i ‘SIM’ (see §4.2.9).
    Examples (51) - (54) show that the locative marker can be used with different
kinds of locations:
     (51) Bule-i         purele-lu-ke…
            basket-LOC put.in-2S.R-SEQ
            ‘You put them in the basket, and...’
     (52) Lufwa are ite-i             la-la-ne.
            man     two house-LOC remain-P.DUR-1/3P.R
            ‘Two men are in the house.’
     (53) Sebei-le i-fi         amblue-po-bile.
            bark-GL fire-LOC heat-DST-1/3P.IR
            ‘We will heat each piece of bark in the fire.’
     (54) Fori si-silu       afwi-i      a-la-ne.
            pig RED-baby trail-LOC do-P.DUR-1/3P.R
            ‘Baby pigs were on the trail.’
    Example (55) shows that the locative can also be used to describe location in
time:
      (55) Lufwa mwamole kotukrie-i klifu noune-lee-ke…
           Man one           dawn-LOC dog take-3S.R-SEQ
           ‘One man at dawn took his dog and…’
    When the location in question is a person, the suffix -lu is attached, followed by
locative -fi.
      (56) Lufwa glei wa-be,          eete-geni inali-lu-fi-le.
              man    NEG go-3S.IR, this-thing woman-NN-LOC-GL
              ‘A man mustn’t go – to this woman.’
    Other locative postpositions may be used to mark a more specific location. All
are formed from a noun + -i. They include:4
    Refer to §6.1.1 of paper by Drew (this volume).
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                                89           mai                     ‘on top of’
           ambei                   ‘under’
           menei                   ‘inside’ ( < meni-i = hole-LOC)
           bwakei ~ bagei          ‘close to’
           roboi                   ‘close to’
   These locative morphemes can also occur alone as adverbs of location (cf §5.5).
Examples (57) and (58) show their use:
    (57) Pensil eke-ambei.
           pencil there-under
           ‘The pencil’s under there.’
    (58) Yeboe-po-mai        fati-ne.
           mat-DST-on.top put.S-1/3P.R
           ‘We put it on the mats.’
3.3.2 Source -fu
    The postposition -fu marks an entity as the origin of another entity. This marker
may be used within a noun phrase to show that the noun it modifies is the origin of
the head noun. In this case, the source precedes the head noun, as in (59) and (60):
      (59) Lumi-fu       lufwa
            Lumi-ABL man
            ‘man from Lumi’
      (60) Mena-nu bebrie-fu ambue            eese le-lee.
            1.PN-NN past-ABL ancestor thus do-3S.R
            ‘My ancestor from before did like this.’
    This marker may also be used at the clausal level to show that a noun is the
source of the action of a verb. An example appears in (61). Note that in contrast to
(59), the noun phrase marked as source follows lufwa ‘man’, and therefore modifies
the verb:5
      (61) Lufwa Mango wokoo-fu          ri-lee.
            man     Mango village-ABL come-3S.R
            ‘The man walked here from Mango.’

    The editors elicited examples (61) and (63) in 2008, and added the accompanying comments.
90                                                                  Kwomtari Grammar    In example (62), the noun marked with -fu modifies the deverbalised verb gipori,
and so means ‘to care for (them) from (when they are in) their eggs’:
      (62) Gwaie         silu tuolu-fu gi-po-ri                 ami.
           cassowary baby egg-ABL care.for-DISTR-NOM way
           ‘The way to look after baby cassowaries from (when they are in) their
           eggs.’
     Example (63) shows a complex use of -fu:
      (63) Yari      lefoo-le Lumi-fu-le      neu-ne-lee-ke ife-rie-lee.
           father.3 son.3-GL Lumi-ABL-GL take-do-3S.R-SEQ ACM-come-3S.R
           ‘The father brought his son from Lumi.’
    In this example, Lumi has received both source marking -fu and goal marking -le.
The two markers correlate respectively with the two verbs in the immediately
following serial verb construction neu ‘take’ and ne ‘do’. Lumi is the source from
which the father takes his son, but he goes to Lumi to do the action and it therefore
receives goal marking as well.
3.3.3 Goal -le
     The postposition -le is used with motion verbs to mark an entity as a place toward
which the subject is moving, the goal of movement. Examples (64) - (66) show this
usage in Kwomtari. Note that when -le is used in this sense, it is always preceded by
the locative marker (-i or -fi):
      (64) Bali-fi-le           wa-lee.
             garden-LOC-GL go-3S.R
             ‘He went to the garden.’
      (65) Wokoo-i-le           wa-lee.
             village-LOC-GL go-3S.R
             ‘He went to the village.’
      (66) Ite-i-le           ri-ie.
             house-LOC-GL come-1S.R
             ‘I came to the house.’
    When the goal is a place name, -le is not attached directly to the name. The place
name is followed by a common noun describing the place, and then the locative and
goal markers, as in (67):
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                   91     (67) Mene weife Nicke-tu       Yetomi wokoo-i-le wa-ne-lu
          1NPL DU      Nick-COM Yetomi village-LOC-GL go-1/3P.R-NN
          na.
          account
          ‘Account of Nick and I going to Yetomi.’
    More frequently in the corpus, the goal marker -le is suffixed to the patient or
recipient of the clause. The verb generally has an object suffix referring to the same
entity. Imonda, a geographically close but unrelated language, has a suffix which is
similarly used to indicate recipients and patients as well as the goal of directional
movement (Seiler 1985:161-165). Examples (68) - (72) show various shades of use of
-le with recipients and patients:
      (68) Klifu gwaie-le            pie-fo-lee.
             dog cassowary-GL bay-3S.O-3S.R

             ‘We followed the Buwale (river).’
    There may be more than one noun in a clause taking the goal marker. Example
(73) shows that -le may be suffixed to both elements of a complex object. Note that
the object marking on the verb is plural:
92                                                                   Kwomtari Grammar         (73) Lufwa-le ari-le       na-te-bule.
              man-GL boy-GL say-3P.O-2P.IR
              ‘You (pl) will tell the men and boys.’
    Examples (74) and (75) show that -le may also be affixed to both the patient and
the recipient of a ditransitive verb. Note that -le changes to -ne following a first or
second person pronoun:6
      (74) Mena-ne eete-geni mamelei-le            nifa-o-ne.
            1.PN-GL here-thing crocodile-GL give.P-1/2S.O-1/3P.R
            ‘They gave me this crocodile (meat).’
      (75) Mena-ne pepre-lu-le fane-o-mo!
            1.PN-GL lean-NN-GL give.S-1/2S.O-2P.R
            ‘You (pl) gave me a lean one (i.e. a snake with no fat on it)!’
     Occasionally only the recipient of a ditransitive verb will be marked with -le, as
in (76):
      (76) Nanu una-ne ari           fane-o-be.
            3.PN 2.PN-GL child give.S-1/2S.O-3S.IR
            ‘She will give the child to you.’
3.3.4 Instrument -tu
     The comitative use of -tu has been discussed above in §3.2.2. It is also used in the
predicate, where it marks a noun which is used in carrying out the action of the verb,
i.e. an instrument. Examples (77) - (79) show this usage:
       (77) kosi-tu
              machete-COM
              ‘with a machete’
       (78) Yefi         luali-le     ka-tu       koona-i    iteritu feti

             ‘I shot a piglet with (i.e. by the light of) a flaming torch.’
3.3.5 Reason/purpose -fe
    The postposition -fe marks a reason for carrying out or intention to carry out the
action described by the predicate. In example (80), obtaining breadfruit was the
reason for going, but only the noun nibie ‘breadfruit’ is evident; the fact it is marked
with -fe sufficiently establishes it as the reason for going.
      (80) Mene nibie-fe                wa-ie.
             1NPL breadfruit-RSN go-1S.R
             ‘I went for breadfruit.’
      The reason for going is expressed more explicitly in example (81):
       (81) Mene nibie            pine-ri-fe      wa-ie.
              1NPL breadfruit get.P-NOM-RSN go-1S.R
              ‘I went to get breadfruit.’
    A state or event which has already occurred or is currently occurring can also be
the reason for a verb. The state/event is nominalised by -lu before taking the -fe
suffix. However, if the subject of the ‘reason’ state/event is third singular, -lu is
dropped. That it is underlyingly present is shown by its reappearance when the
subject is made third plural, as shown in (82) and (83):
      (82) Gife       le-o-lee-fe           wa-ie.
            hunger do-1/2S.O-3S.R-RSN go-1S.R
            ‘I was hungry, so I went.’
      (83) Weife pruele-la-ne-lu-fe                te    Kaspere “Aai aai aai!”
            DU      flee.P-P.DUR-1/3P.R-NN-RSN FOC Casper “Hey hey hey”
            na-te-lee.
            say-3P.O-3S.R
            ‘The two were fleeing, so Casper called to them, “Hey, hey, hey!”’
    Beneficiaries are sometimes marked with -fe, as in (84). This seems to be because
doing something in one’s relationship to another person is considered a reason for
action.77
    [Editors’ note] We have not been able to verify that beneficiaries are normally suffixed with -fe.
    Informants consider this construction questionable.

           ‘He gave a pig to us.’3.4 Postpositional phrases
     The structure of the postpositional phrase is:
        (NP / Clause / PP) Postposition.
     The modal outlook postpositions (set 1) relate back to the entity they mark, which
can be a noun, a noun phrase, or a whole clause. The postposition adds the speaker’s
perspective of the marked phrase/clause. The postpositional phrase occurs in the place
that the noun, noun phrase or clause would normally occur.
      (85) Te kotukrie-me koru pine-lee-ke              seri-fe      wa-lee.
            FOC dawn-CER        bow get.P-3S.R-SEQ hunt-RSN go-3S.R
            ‘Truly at dawn, he got his bow (and arrows) to go hunting.’
      (86) Une-bo             glefe pruele-mo-lu?
            2.NPL-FOC.DEC why flee.P-2P.R-NN
            ‘Why did you (both) run away?’
      (87) Weife glase       le-te-bile         pe?
            DU      goggles do-3P.O-1/3P.IR POSB
            ‘Shall we go “goggling” (i.e. diving with goggles to hunt crocodiles)?’
    The postpositional phrases relating nouns to each other (set 2) generally consist
of noun phrase plus postposition, as in (88) and (89), though -lu also suffixes to
clauses (90):
     (88) Samuele-lu ite
            Samuel-NN house
            ‘Samuel’s house’
     (89) Mena-nu bebrie-fu ambue           eese le-lee.
            1.PN-NN past-ABL ancestor thus do-3S.R
            ‘My ancestor from before did like this.’
     (90) Gwaie-tu            klifu-tu   yekrune-ne-lu    na.
            cassowary-COM dog-COM fall.P-1/3P.R-NN word
            ‘Story of a cassowary and a dog falling.’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                    95     The noun-predicate postpositional phrases (set 3) are verbal modifiers and as such
occur in the verb phrase, always preceding the verb. This pattern is illustrated for
intransitive clauses in (91):
      (91) Ambo-fe wa-lee.
             bush-RSN go-3S.R
             ‘He went to the bush.’
    In transitive clauses, set 3 postpositional phrases generally occur between the
goal and the verb, as in (92) and (93):
      (92) Bole       koona kolilu i-fi        tu-po-ne-ke…
            animal back bone fire-LOC cook-DISTR-1/3P.R-SEQ
            ‘We cooked the animal’s backbone in the fire…’
      (93) Wokoo-i-le          wofri-wofri-tu wa-lee.
            village-LOC-GL RED-fear-COM go-3S.R
            ‘He went home in terror.’
     In example (94), two coordinate clauses both contain nouns modified by the
instrumental/comitative marker -tu:
       (94) Te meli-tu        suena-ne-lee-ke      te    marasine-tu      fue-lee.
            FOC water-COM wash-say-3S.R-SEQ FOC medicine-COM tie-3S.R
            ‘She washed it with water, then bandaged it with medicine (ointment?).’
    When the verb phrase contains a compound verb consisting of a generic verb
preceded by a noun phrase, the postpositional phrase precedes the entire compound
verb. This is illustrated in (95) and (96):
      (95) Inali        ari    metie mena-fe paiepaie feti a-po-ne.
             woman child really 1PL-RSN happy                 very do-DISTR-1/3P.R
             ‘The women and children were very pleased with us.’
      (96) Fie-fo-ri-fe             tialutu le-fo-ie.
             ask-3S.O-NOM-RSN six            do-3S.O-1S.R
             ‘I asked her six times.’ (Lit. ‘I did six times to ask her.’)
96                                                                    Kwomtari Grammar    Example (97) contains two postpositional phrases in a coordinate relationship,
both modifying the one verb:
     (97) Fori lufwa [ri-tu]            fori [ri-tu]     a-lee-lu      na.
           pig man body-COM pig body-COM do-3S.R-NN account
           ‘(It is the) account of a pig which had both a pig’s body and a man’s
           body (split down the middle).’8
    Sometimes postpositional phrases are moved to the sentence-initial theme
position; this is especially frequent with temporal postposition phrases. The content of
these postposition phrases is always a noun or noun phrase (as in (98)); the noun may
be a nominalised clause, as in (99), or a deverbal, as in (100) below.
      (98) Te bofu            [krie-tu]   wa-lu-ke…
             and another night-COM go-2S.R-SEQ
             ‘Another day, you go...’
      (99) [Lie gaga ne-la-lee-lu]-fi                sine-te-le.
             sun heat say-P.DUR-3S.R-NN-LOC put.on-3P.O-2S.IR
             ‘You will put them (cassowary eggs) in a place heated by the sun.’
   Example (100) shows that it is possible to have one postpositional phrase
modifying two clauses.
   (100) [Mie           feta-te-ri]-fe,      nanu mei wa-lee, mene
           sago.blind see-3P.O-NOM-RSN 3.PN also go-3S.R 1NPL
           mei wa-ie.
           also go-1S.R
           ‘To see the sago blind, he went and I also went.’
     Postpositional phrases can be recursively embedded. In (99) above, the
postposition -lu nominalises the clause lie gaga nelalee ‘the sun heats’, and in turn
the entire construction is embedded in a locative phrase by the locative postposition
-fi. In (101) below, the phrase Mena-nu aie-lu-fi is triply embedded in turn by the
postpositions -lu, -fi and -le. This is the normal construction for movement toward a
person:
      (101) [[Mena-nu aie-lu]-fi]-le              wa-bile.
             1.PN-NN      father.1/2-NN-LOC-GL go-1/3P.IR
             ‘Let’s go to my father.’
8
    Phrases in square brackets are embedded postpositional phrases.
Kwomtari Grammar                                                         97   Example (102) shows that two postpositional phrases giving reason can be
embedded within one another:
   (102) Mene koru [mie            seri-ne-fo-ri]-fe           wa-ri-fe.
          1NPL bow sago.blind hunt-say-3S.O-NOM-RSN go-NOM-RSN

          ‘I got my bow (and arrows) to go to hunt at the sago blind.’
        4. Verbs and verb phrases    Verbs are the major open word class in Kwomtari other than nouns. Verbs are
easily distinguished as they are always marked for subject. They also uniquely take a
set of object markers and a pair of aspect markers (see table 12). This chapter begins
with a discussion of the semantic features of verb stems (§4.1), then discusses the
affixes found on Kwomtari verbs (§4.2) and concludes with a description of the verb
phrase (§4.3).","[88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]"

   When te functions as a focus marker for NPs, it hosts suffixes in the same way as
nouns do.

          pig FOC-GL eat-P.DUR-3S.R sago meat-GL
          ‘The pig is eating it: the sago pulp.’
    Tetu (FOC-COM) can be used to refer to a focal instrument.

            ‘Wood that we build houses with…’
    Tefu (FOC-ABL) is used to mark a characteristic. The characteristic it indicates
must reference an entity that is a true noun (not an adjective – contrast (5a) and (5b)
below), or a reduplicated deverbal verb stem (example (6)).

            RED-get.S FOC-ABL man
            ‘a man who keeps taking (without asking)’
    Used with the locative suffix -i, te marks an established referenced locational
centre in discourse (example (8)). It is the base for the two most frequently used
demonstratives, eete ‘this’ and ute ‘that’ (see §2.4).
       (8) Te eete-geni gwaie                tia-fwa-lee-lu         mwa,
            FOC here-thing cassowary flee-MOT.AWAY-3S.R-NN no

              ‘This cassowary didn’t run away. It fell here (where it was shot) and
              died.’
     Te also functions as a postpositional clitic, where it marks contrastive focus (see
§3.1.2). Additionally, te is used in constructions meaning ‘all sorts of X’, where X is
a noun. See examples (26) and (27) in §2.1.5. Note also that te is homophonous with
the third person plural object suffix on the verb.
6.1.2 feti intensifier
   The particle feti follows the noun or noun phrase that it modifies. It gives the
meaning of ‘true’, ‘really’, or ‘very’.
      (9) Eete-geni ka kaisekli feti le-ne.
           here-thing tree strength very do-1/3P.R
           ‘These trees are very strong (hardwood).’

           ‘Very early on Sunday morning, the deacon of Lumi blew his horn.’
      In the following example, feti modifies a noun and means ‘truly’.

               3.PN-FOC.INC pig truly PRB say-3S.R

    This particle precedes what it is limiting. When kame precedes a noun, then it
limits consideration to that noun alone as in examples (13) and (14).
      (13) Te kame rori yati                 tabe
             FOC only fish sago.paste sago.pancake

             only woman net thus do-3P.R
             ‘Only the women used their nets like that.’
     When kame precedes a verb phrase, it is used as a limiting adverb, meaning ‘only
that event’ (15).
      (15) Kame glei tuwa-po-ne-ke                  fu-po-ne          a-nemwa.
             only not carry-DISTR-1/3P.R-SEQ tie-DISTR-1/3P.R do-1/3P.R no

      (16) Kame amwi-me la-la-bile.

             ‘We’ll just stay well.’
      (17) Kame wa-ie         ite-i-le.
             only go-1S.R house-LOC-GL
             ‘I just went home.’
6.1.4 Noun negator preme ~ prelu ‘absence’
    The particle preme ‘absence’ is a noun negator; it denies the existence of the
preceding noun within the predicate. This usage is illustrated in (18); the noun ragulu
‘of branches’ is part of the predicate, and so its existence is denied. Eetegeni ka is the
subject, not part of the predicate, and its existence is not affected by preme.
      (18) Eete-geni ka ragu-lu               preme      feti le-lee.
             here-thing tree branch-NN absence very do-3S.R
             ‘This tree had no branches.’
   If there is no noun present in the predicate, then preme denies the existence of the
most likely noun that would be there. In example (19), the house is the subject and
142                                                                   Kwomtari Grammarnot part of the predicate, so preme is not denying the existence of the house but the
existence of anything in the house.
      (19) Ite      preme      teme-la-lee.
             house absence stand.S-P.DUR-3S.R
             ‘The house stands empty.’
    The negator preme occurs with deverbals to indicate that the action expressed by
the deverbal has not occurred.
      (20) Te wa-ri         preme      teime tafi-la-lee.
            FOC go-NOM absence here death-remain-3S.R
            ‘It died here without having gone anywhere.’
      (21) Wopenei ari         lupole-ri     preme      la-la-lee
            Wopenei child deliver-NOM absence stay-P.DUR-3S.R
            kru-wo-le-ne.
            arrive-DIR.AWAY-do-1/3P.R
            ‘Wopenei was there, without having had her child, when we arrived.’
      The particle prelu has almost identical meaning to preme. Its final -lu requires
that it is the final constituent of a noun phrase, rather than a clausal constituent. This
is illustrated in (22) and (23):
       (22) rori meli prelu
              fish water absence
              ‘absence of fish water’
       (23) eete-geni lufwa kaisekli prelu
              here-thing man strength absence
              ‘this man without strength’
6.1.5 Resemblance keme, kelu
    The particles keme and kelu, both meaning ‘resemblance’, follow the noun or
noun phrase which is the object of comparison, X. This construction is used with the
verb le ‘do’ to form a predicate, meaning ‘to resemble X’ (see also §7.1.4).
      (24) Mena-nu lilu una-nu keme                   le-lee.
             1.PN-NN cloth 2.PN-NN resemblance do-3S.R
             ‘My skirt is like yours.’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                          143         (25) Fife-lu         ... maie ai-lu      keme            le-be.
              excrement-NN ... egg hut-NN resemblance do-3S.IR
              ‘The sawdust (lit. excrement) will be like a nest.’
    Kelu, with its final -lu, occupies the last position in a noun phrase, which can be
the subject of a predicate.
      (26) ekeni lisi          kelu
             that maggot resembling
             ‘that thing like a maggot’
6.1.6 mei ‘also’
     The particle mei ‘also’ follows a noun, signalling that this noun is not unique in
its role.
       (27) Nanu mei wa-lee mene mei wa-ie.
            3.pn also go-3S.R 1NPL also go-1S.R
            ‘He went and I also went.’
       (28) Inali     luku     wo-le-fo-bile.               Te lufwa mwa. Ari

            young-NN also no
            ‘The women will gather round her. But not the men. And not the young
            boys either.’
6.1.7 tuke ‘together’
    The particle tuke has a similar function and distribution to the comitative
postposition -tu2 (see §3.2.2). Unlike -tu, which belongs to the subject of a clause,
tuke acts in the predicate, marking dual objects, reasons or instruments. Tuke follows
the argument it is marking. It can be marked on both arguments (example (29)) or just
the second of the two (example (30)):
      (29) Mene fori prafe-ie-lu-fe               tuke     Wopenei-lu
             1NPL pig shoot.S-1S.R-NN-RSN together Wopenei-NN

                 ‘Because I shot a pig, and also to speak to Wopenei’s mother, I came.’2
    The -ke may be the same as that which occurs in demonstratives.

             ‘They got machetes, then got sticks and vines and brought them.’
6.1.8 fune return/recapitulation
    The particle fune functions both like a noun and an adverb. In example (31), fune
with its suffixes is the only member and therefore the head of a noun phrase.
      (31) Fune-lu-me         fane-ie.
             return-NN-CER give.S-1S.R
             ‘I gave a return gift.’
      In example (32), it functions adverbially.
        (32) Fune nafie-fo-ie,         fune nafie-o-lee    a-la-ne.
             return like-3S.O-1S.R return like-1/2S.O-3S.R do-P.DUR-1/3P.R
             ‘I like him and he likes me.’
    In the following two examples, fune is reduplicated and used with the pro-verb a
‘do’ to encode a reciprocal relationship (see §4.2.7).
      (33) Mene weife fune-fune-a-ne.
             1NPL DU        RED-return-do-1/3P.R
             ‘We two gave things to each other.’
      (34) Mene weife Julia-tu           yesou        tue-ri-fe    fune-fune
             1NPL DU        Julia-COM something cook-NOM-RSN RED-return
             a-la-ne-a-ne.
             do-P.DUR-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R
             ‘Julia and I habitually cook for each other.’
    In the following example, fune is used as a pro-verb to recapitulate previous
actions:
      (35) Te-fe       nebue mwi pa-po-ne-ke                 kotue     mwi
            FOC-RSN now         vine dig-DISTR-1/3P.R-SEQ morning vine

            ‘So after we dig vines now, after we dig vines tomorrow, after we dig
            vines the day after tomorrow, then we’ll again do (digging vines).’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                      1456.1.9 mani prohibitive
    The particle mani ‘PHB’ is unique in always occurring after the final verb in the
clause or sentence being prohibited. It possibly comes from mwa nie < mwa ne-ie ‘I
said “no” (lit. no say-1S.R). It is no longer used as a verb since it does not change with
a change in subject. Negative imperatives are discussed in §9.3. Two examples are
given here:
      (36) Wofoli               na-fo-lu         mani…
             sister(of.M).1/2 say-3S.O-2S.R PHB
             ‘You mustn’t say to your sister, “…”’
      (37) Kose menegu le-te-lu                 mani.
             lest thought do-3P.O-2S.R PHB
             ‘Don’t think of them.’6.2 Conjunctions
     The focus marker te (see §6.1.1) is the most frequently used conjunction and the
basis for all others, except for the adversative conjunction o ‘or’ which is taken
directly from Tok Pisin. In a text, sentences other than the initial one often start with
te. Te marks what has gone before; it is perhaps best translated ‘given that’. The other
conjunctions are given below. They all express logical clausal relationships, whereas
the clausal suffixes -ke ‘SEQ’ and -i ‘SIM’ express temporal relationships between
clauses.
         tetu   FOC-COM ‘then’ – chronologically next.
                     The first proposition is immediately accompanied by the
                     second.
         tete   FOC-FOC       ‘therefore’ – imminent consequence.
                     The first proposition is a strong cause, forcing the
                     second.
         tefe   FOC-RSN       ‘so’ – result.
                     The first proposition is an enabling clause for the second.
         o      (from TP) ‘or’
    Examples of conjunctions as they occur in conjoined sentences are given in §8.2
and §8.4.2. For ease of comprehension, I will use the glosses ‘then’, ‘therefore’ and
‘so’ rather than their literal morpheme by morpheme glosses.

                             7. Clauses7.1 Clause structure
7.1.1 Basic clause structure
    Every clause must necessarily contain a predicate. Though the vast majority of
predicates involve a verb, there are some that do not. A clause may have an overt
noun phrase subject, which would then precede the verb.
        Clause = (Subject) Predicate
    Kwomtari has nominative-accusative agreement of both noun phrases and verbal
person markers. The general order in the clause is SOV. Example (1) illustrates this
basic clause order:
       (1) Klifu gwaie-le         pie-fo-lee.
            dog cassowary-GL bay-3S.O-3S.R
            ‘The dog bayed at the cassowary.’
    However, in all verbal clauses the number and person of the subject, and
generally the goal, if present, are marked on the verb by suffixation. This often leads
to deletion of subject noun phrases (2), goal noun phrases (3), or both (4):
       (2) Wokoo-i-le          ri-ie.
             village-LOC-GL come-1S.R
             ‘I came to the village.’

             man     ask-3S.O-3P.R true          POSB
             ‘The men asked him, “Is it true?”’
       (4) Bule-i          purele-lu-ke…
             basket-LOC put.in-2S.R-SEQ
             ‘You put them in the basket, and…’

148                                                                  Kwomtari Grammar7.1.2 Non-verbal predicates
    Equative predicates are usually non-verbal The verb le ‘do’ can optionally be
used (see §7.1.3 below). Mwa ‘no’ can itself be a predicate.
       (5) Nelene wofri feti le-fo-lee,            mene mwa.
            Nelen fear very do-3S.O-3S.R, 1NPL no
            ‘Nelen’s really afraid of him, I’m not.’
       (6) Mene klifu wolu.
            1NPL dog already
            ‘I have a dog.’
       (7) Mene klifu mwa.
            1NPL dog no
            ‘I don’t have a dog.’
7.1.3 Descriptive clauses
    Descriptive clauses have two primary components: an optional subject and an
obligatory predicate. The predicate contains a complement conveying a noun
characteristic and, usually optionally, the verb le ‘do’. If le is present it rarely has
more than subject/status marking.
       (8) Eete-geni ite             selilu mena-nu (le-lee).
             here-thing house big           1.PN-NN (do-3S.R)
             ‘This big house is mine.’
       (9) Nebulu ari           feti le-lu-aga!
             bad        child very do-2S.R-EXC
             ‘You are a very bad child!’
     (10) Fwi            wamolu (le-lee).
             coconut long           do-3S.R
             ‘The coconut (palm) is tall.’
     (11) Mene tukilu auteli.
             1NPL small girl
             ‘I’m a little girl.’
     (12) Une kwoneblu auteli le-lu.
             2NPL white            girl    do-2S.R
             ‘You’re a white girl.’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                   149    When a non-permanent characteristic is attributed to an entity, the predicate is
sometimes marked with durative aspect to specify the time period during which the
entity demonstrated the characteristic. This is illustrated in (13):
      (13) Sospan      nigi le-la-lee.
           saucepan hot do-P.DUR-3S.R
           ‘The saucepan is hot.’
     When adjectives occur in the predicate, they can optionally be stripped of their
-lu ending:
      (14) Ka ri-lu         wi le-lee.
            tree body-NN red do-3S.R
            ‘The tree’s body is red.’
      (15) Mene tukilu le-ie.
            1NPL small do-1S.R
            ‘I am small.’
7.1.4 Comparisons
     There are no comparative or superlative adjectival forms. Comparisons are made
with the verb le ‘do’, preceded by an adjective giving the quality in question. The
entity being compared is the subject of the verb, while the standard of comparison is
positioned and marked as the goal. Examples (16) and (17) show the comparative
construction:
      (16) Una-nu klifu seli-me feti le-fo-lee               mena-nu klifu-le.
             2.PN-NN dog big-CER very do-3S.O-3S.R 1.PN-NN dog-GL
             ‘Your dog is bigger than mine.’ (Lit. ‘Your dog does very big to my
             dog.’)
      (17) Mena-nu ri         una-nu ri-le         umugi le-o-lee.
             1.PN-NN skin 2.PN-NN skin-GL black do-1/2S.O-3S.R
             ‘My skin is blacker than yours.’ (Lit. ‘My skin does black to your skin.’)
    The particle keme ‘resemblance’ is used to state resemblance. Here, the item
compared is the subject of the predicate, which contains the standard of comparison,
followed by keme and the verb le ‘do’ (see §6.1.5).
      (18) Fife-lu          ... maie ai-lu       keme          le-be.
           excrement-NN … egg hut-NN resemblance do-3S.IR
           ‘The sawdust (lit. excrement) will be like a nest.’
150                                                                    Kwomtari Grammar         (19) Une una-nu aie             keme     le-lu.
              2NPL 2.PN-NN father.1/2 resemblance do-2S.R
              ‘You’re like your father.’
    The word keme does not specify the particulars of the resemblance. These must
be gained from context. In example (19), the speaker could be referring to physical
appearance or to character.
       It is possible to be more specific, for example:
         (20) Klifu are mwamole ri-lu-me                le-ne.
                dog two one              body-NN-CER do-1/3P.R
                ‘The two dogs are the same (size, colour).’ (Lit. ‘have one body’)
    Another word, atuke, has similar usage to keme. My hypothesis is that atuke
implies exact similarity (identicality), and keme merely resemblance. Atuke occurs
only in these descriptive clauses.
      (21) Pike-tu            ueiau-tu             mwamole ri       atuke
             cockatoo-COM black.cockatoo-COM one              body identical
             le-ne.
             do-1/3S.R
             ‘The white cockatoo and the black cockatoo have the same body.’7.2 Negated clause
    The predicate may be negated by the adverb glei, which is positioned first in the
predicate:1
     (22) Te se-le-fo-lee               glei menegu-fe a-be.          Nuboue
            FOC thus-do-3S.O-3S.R NEG breath-RSN do-3S.IR good
            la-la-be.
            remain-P.DUR-3S.IR
            ‘She’ll do that to her and she won’t be short of breath. She will stay
            well.’
Example (23) shows glei negating a non-verbal predicate:
     (23) Mene glei tomulu lufwa.
            1NPL NEG new           man
            ‘I’m not a new (inexperienced) man.’1
    Refer to earlier discussion of glei in §5.3.2.
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                     151    If the predicate is verbal, the negated verb takes the suffix -i in addition to being
preceded by glei. It appears that -i is used to give clarification as to how much of a
sentence is being negated, since the scope of glei can extend over more than one verb.
Note that when -i follows the 3rd singular realis suffix -lee, -ee drops out and only -i
is evident. The negating suffix -i is homophonous with the clausal suffix -i showing
simultaneous action, and may sometimes have been confused with it.
      (24) Inalilufwa glei Pita-le ri-ne-ke
             people      NEG Peter-GL come-1/3P.R-SEQ
             feta-ne-a-ne-i.
             see-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R-NEG
             ‘The people did not habitually come and look at Peter.’
    Mwa ‘no’ can also be used to clarify the scope of negation much as -i does, by
being placed after the clause, as discussed previously (§5.3.1). This is illustrated in
(25):
      (25) Te weife glei fo-po-ne,               mwa, kame
           FOC DU        NEG eat-DISTR-1/3P.R no        only
           tuwa-po-ne.
           carry.away-DISTR-1/3P.R
           ‘We two didn’t eat (them), we just carried them away.’
    As example (26) shows, -i and mwa sometimes co-occur:
     (26) Mena nebue glei amwi a-la-ne-i,                 mwa.
           1PL    now     NEG good do-P.DUR-1/3S.R-NEG no
           ‘Now we don’t act/do it well.’
    Example (27) shows glei having a scope of two clauses, with mwa being used to

   Relative clauses are formed by nominalising the verb with the suffix -lu. In the
majority of cases found in the data corpus, the relative clause precedes the noun it
152                                                                   Kwomtari Grammarmodifies. This contrasts with adjectival modifiers, which for inanimate nouns
generally follow the noun being modified. The fronting of the relative clause in the
noun phrase is due to it being a specifying constituent. In the following examples, the
relativised clause is underlined for clarity. Examples (28) and (29) show the
formation of restrictive relative clauses (relative clauses specifying the identity of the
head noun):
      (28) tiafwi pipirine-ie-lu bwali
            snake kill-1S.R-NN shell.ring

            ‘story about a man from Lumi seeing God’s strength’
    In example (30) the relative clause functions as a qualifier instead of a specifier
and follows the noun phrase it modifies:
      (30) ka telu Aie              Gote le-te-lee-lu

                     8. Sentence structure8.1 Simple sentences
     A simple sentence contains one clause, which is marked on the verb for status -
realis or irrealis. The default status is realis, so this is the status assumed when the
predicate is nonverbal. The clause functions as the sentence base, and is associated
with a typical intonation.1 Examples (1) - (5) are examples of simple sentences:
       (1) Nariemu-le ite-i              gria-le-lee.

       (3) Lie gaga le-la-lee-o.
              sun heat do-P.DUR-3S.R-VOC
              ‘The sun is hot.’ (Lit. ‘The sun’s heat is doing.’)
       (4) Lufwa ari-le          babrute-po-ne.

              ‘The men beat the children.’
       (5) Nanu una-ne ari fane-o-be.

              ‘She will give the child to you.’
    The sentence may also contain constituents that are external to the main clause.
Dik (1991:19) describes this type of constituent as a ‘theme’. Themes convey
pragmatic information, e.g. highlighting a sentential topic or focus, presenting an

"4.3 Semi-vowels
    The semi-vowels [j] and [w] are inserted between vowels, to optimise the
division of words into CV syllables. Following /i/, [j] is inserted preceding any

even before other front vowels, such as /ɛ/:
              (12) /uɭiai/                [u.ɭi.jɐi]                  ‘rat’
                      /uɛiau/             [u.wɛi.jɐu]                 ‘black cockatoo’
                      /kɔɭiɛpi/           [kɔ.ɭi.jɛ.pi]               ‘turtle’
                      /ɸɔriɛsɔ/           [ɸɔ.ri.jɛ.sɔ]               ‘food’
                      /məkəiɛ/            [mə.kəi.jɛ]                 ‘ton tree’1   Between any back vowel and any other vowel, the semi-vowel [w] is inserted.
Examples are given in (13):
              (13) /auə/                  [ɐu.wə]                     ‘string bag’
                      /tui/               [tu.wi]                     ‘prostitute’
                      /iəui/              [jəu.wi]                    ‘posterior’
                      /iɛɔani/            [jɛ.ɔ.wɐ.ni]                ‘diarrhoea’
                      /naɔɭi/             [nɐ.wɔ.ɭi]                  ‘s/he told me’    The presence of a back vowel will trigger the insertion of [w], regardless of
whether the back vowel precedes or follows the syllable break. In (13) above, the
top three words (/auə/, /tui/ and /jɛɔani/) all have the back vowel preceding the
other vowel. In the last word, [w] insertion is triggered by the presence of /ɔ/
following the syllable division. (Note that Kwomtari phonology treats /a/ as a
central vowel, not a back vowel; this is also shown in the first two examples in
(12) above.)
       Other occurrences of [j] and [w] can be analysed as allophones of /i/ and /u/
respectively, under the following desyllabification rule: /i/ and /u/ become
nonsyllabic in syllable onset position before a vowel, and intervocalically.2 This
rule is illustrated in the examples in (14):
1
    Ton (TP): A tree with edible fruit (Pometia pinnata); it is also good for timber (Mihalic 1971).
2
    [Editors’ note] An alternative analysis would be that the semi-vowels are phonemic /j/ and /w/
    wherever their occurrence cannot be accounted for under the semi-vowel insertion processes
    described previously.

   There are difficulties with this analysis, however. There are several pairs
showing a contrast in analogous environment between [u] and [w], which suggests
the possibility of [w] being a phoneme, rather than merely an allophone of /u/:
          (15) /uabɛ/              [wɐ.bɛ]                     ‘he will go’
                 /uabɛ/            [u.wɐ.bɛ]                   ‘type of edible greens’
          (16) /ua/                [wɐ]                        ‘go’
                 /u̞a/             [u̞.wɐ]                     ‘look there’
          (17) /wɛi/               [wɛi]                       ‘yes’
                 /uɛsi/            [u.wɛ.si]                   ‘mucus’
    However, examples (15) and (16) are dubious. In (15), the word for these type
of greens has also been recorded as [ɭuɐbɛ]. This suggests the possibility of a
diachronic cause for the form [uwɐbɛ]: perhaps the retroflex lateral has been
omitted but the word has not completed its change to become [wabe] in
accordance with the proposed rule yet. In example (16), the word [u̞wɐ] ‘look
there’ contains a morpheme break which is likely to influence the phonology. This
word is made up of two morphemes: /u̞/,‘eye’ and /ua/, ‘go’; literally meaning ‘put
your eyes over there’. This still leaves (17), where for some reason, the first part
of the desyllabification rule does not seem to apply, but I am reluctant to upgrade
[w] to phonemic status on the basis of one word. Possibly the initial phoneme is
/u̞/, rather than /u/, and /u̞/does not cause labialisation.
                5. Suprasegmentals     The Kwomtari language does not exhibit contrasts in nasalisation, tone or
vowel length. The only suprasegmental worthy of discussion in this section is
stress.
    Stress is difficult to hear; often syllables seem to carry equal stress, or a given
word is pronounced with different stress on different occasions. There are no
examples of contrastive stress. In a bisyllabic word uttered in isolation, the first
syllable often sounds stronger, but the second syllable carries rising pitch. As
noted in §2.2, a syllable containing schwa is not stressed (with the single
exception of /mənə/ [ˈmənə]), so a word containing schwa in its initial syllable will
normally have its stress on the second syllable.
    How, then, is stress realised? According to Lehiste (1970:106):
        When the speaker’s activity in producing stressed syllables is in
        focus, stress may be defined in terms of greater effort that enters
        into the production of stressed syllable as compared to an
        unstressed syllable…Ultimately, differences in stress are due to
        differences in physical effort. The effort is reflected directly in the
        activity of the muscles involved in respiration, and indirectly in
        subglottal pressure.
    She then explains that intensity and fundamental frequency (pitch) can both be
important factors in stress production and identification. Both involve this ‘effort’
on the part of the speaker, but they usually work together, rather than
independently. The speaker will be aware of which syllable he is stressing, but the
hearer perceives both intensity and pitch in the same way, since intensity involves
greater amplitude of the individual pulses and pitch involves a greater number of
pulses reaching the ear ‘per unit time’ (Lehiste 1970:145-146). However the
hearer is not concerned by which syllable is stressed, if stress is not contrastive.
     When words were fitted into the frames ‘he said_’, ‘this man said_’ and ‘did
this man say_?’, all words were stressed on the final syllable, whether the word
                                          42
Kwomtari Phonology                                                               43was affixed or unaffixed. Words of more than two syllables also exhibited
secondary stress, which fell on the first syllable of three and four syllable words,
and the second syllable of five syllable words. The two stresses (second syllable
and final syllable) in five syllable words often sounded equal.
    The analysis of stress remains uncertain, but since stress does not seem to
operate contrastively (or even consistently), this subject may be regarded as
worthy of further study but not significant in Kwomtari phonology.
              6. Morphophonemics   There are not many morphophonemic alternations in Kwomtari. The
morphophonemic alternations discussed here are generally conditioned only by
morphemes, usually affect only adjacent morphemes and are not apparent in the
general phonological patterns.","[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"
"     Further evidence is the word <afteli> ‘quickly’. This word is probably
underlyingly /a.ɸə.tɛ.ɭi/ [ɐ.βə.tɛ.ɭi], with a syllable divison following /a/, and
schwa between /ɸ/ and /t/. The alternative would require an initial VC syllable
/aɸ/, which is a syllable type not found elsewhere in the language (see §3.1).
     However, there are a few contrastive pairs for schwa:
       (9) /ə/ vs    /ɛ/     /məɭi/         [məɭi]            ‘water, river’

                      3. Phonotactics3.1 Syllable structure
    The most common pattern for Kwomtari syllables is CV. Only syllables
consisting of onset + peak (e.g. CV) may occur in non-initial position. Closed
syllables, which are very rare, may not end with a plosive; generally the final
segment is a nasal. There are no unambiguous examples of VC syllables.
Examples of acceptable syllable patterns follow:

    It should be noted that vowel sequences including /u̞/ and /i̞/ are difficult for outsiders to
    differentiate from their higher counterparts, /u/ and /i/, and it is likely that they are used in vowel
    sequences, but have not been noticed. /ɐu̞/ has only been noticed in morphophonemics (see
    §6.2.3).

sequence of two vowels, the vowels constitute a diphthong if the second vowel is
higher than the first one. Only if this condition is met are the vowels treated by
Kwomtari speakers as belonging to the same syllable. If the second vowel is lower
than the first vowel or the same height, the vowels belong to adjoining syllables. A
maximum of two vowels can occur in the same syllable; triphthongs do not occur
in Kwomtari. Since only syllables of the type ‘onset + peak’ occur in non-initial
position, the end of every non-initial syllable is marked by a permitted diphthong
or single vowel.","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"

                             11. Residue    Some grammatical features of the languages were not able to be resolved in this
research. Following are some unsolved issues.
    a. The suffix -lu
     A clear meaning covering all uses of -lu is yet to be found. There are some uses
of -lu which are difficult to account for. Linked with this is the problem of defining
adjectives. It may be possible to form a separate class of adjectives, though I suspect
not. The order within the noun phrase depends on this and is not completely clear.
Use of -lu on clauses needs further investigation. Also, it is not clear why, when the
locative postposition is suffixed to a human entity, -lu must occur between the noun
and the locative postposition.
    b. The status of the nominals used in compound verbs
    The status of the nominals used in conjunction with the verb le is in question. Are
they actually verbal compounds (incorporations) or are they verb phrases? They
usually are tightly knit together, but other words like feti can sometimes intervene
between the nominal and the derivational verb.
    c. Motion suffixes on the verb
    It is not clear what functions the te and fe parts of these suffixes play. It is not
clear under what circumstances the suffixes based on te are used in preference to
those based on fe. The distinction may be linked to transitivity. Since one of these
motion suffixes has a second aspectual meaning, others may also display aspectual
meaning.
    d. Irrealis status
     The uses of irrealis status have not been completely sorted out yet. It is used for
all future events, whatever their certainty. It is also used to mark an ability on the part
of someone to do something. Whether irrealis status can be used for contrafactual
constructions is unknown, because they do not exist in the current data corpus. This
sort of construction will need to be found.","[179, 180]"

Introduction                                                                        3    Kwomtari is one of six languages generally grouped together as the ‘Kwomtari
family’. This family is not demonstrably related to any of the larger Papuan families
(e.g. Trans New Guinea, Sepik, Torricelli). To date, virtually no materials have been
published from any of the languages in the family. The only exception is the Fas
language, on which two brief articles have appeared (Baron 1979, 1983a); more
recently, several articles have been posted on the web, also relating to Fas (Baron
2007, n.d.; Blake 2007).
    Papua New Guinea is the most linguistically diverse country in the world; in turn,
Sandaun Province is probably linguistically the most diverse region in Papua New
Guinea. Within an area of 36,300 km2 and a population of 185,741 (2000 census),
there are 102 languages – an average of only 1,821 speakers per language – belonging
to eight distinct language families, together with perhaps three isolates (Ross
2005:30). Kwomtari is immediately adjoined by the following languages: Baibai to
the north, Guriaso to the east, Yalë (also known as Nagatman) to the south, Nai (also
known as Biaka) to the south-west, and Amanab to the west. However, the number of
languages within a few days walk is immense (refer Map 2).

4                                                                                              Introduction     The area where Kwomtari is spoken is the lowland plain south of the Bewani
Mountains. This mountain range, about 35 kilometres to the north, rises to 1500
metres above sea level, and is the source of rivers which flow southward through the
language area toward the upper reaches of the Sepik River. In contrast, the language
area is largely flat, gradually sloping from 160 metres above sea level in its north to
80 metres elevation in the south. This terrain is covered by dense tropical rainforest
and sago swamp. The language area is bounded in the south by the Yagroner Hills, an
outcropping of about a dozen peaks, the tallest rising to 625 metres; the villages south
of the hills speak Yalë. Yanebi airstrip, in the north of the language area, is located at
a latitude of 3° 31.31’ south and a longitude of 141° 27.69’ east.
    The language area has a hot and humid climate. Temperatures vary between an
overnight minimum of about 24 degrees Celsius and a daytime maximum of about 40
degrees. Annual rainfall is between 2000 and 2500 millimetres, with the wet season
roughly between November and March.
     Total population was 606 at the time of the 2000 census,1 but is now closer to 800
given the recorded annual births by the SIL team. In total, six villages speak the
language: Kwomtari, Mango, Baifeni, Yanebi, Yaur and Wagreni. (In addition, there
is a settlement known as the Moitari camp, which is not considered a village since it
is occupied only by one clan.) The largest village is Yaur, but Baifeni is considered
the most central village geographically and linguistically.2
     The villages are situated on three rivers flowing southward through the language
area. The westernmost of these is the Sukura River (shown on some maps as the
Pukwor). Kwomtari village is currently located on both sides of this river, just below
its confluence with the Yakura River.3 Mango is about two kilometres downstream,
also on both sides of the river. A small hamlet counted as part of Kwomtari village is
adjacent to the Kwomtari airstrip about three kilometres west of the river. East of the
Sukura River is the Senu (North) River, on which Yanebi and Baifeni are located,
with Yanebi furthest upstream. When the Senu River reaches the Yagroner Hills it1
  The population figure of 782 given by Loving and Bass (1964) includes villages now considered to
  belong to the Guriaso language (including Guriaso, Maragin, Mofor, Wurubai and Ekas).

  Earlier sources call this village Baiberi. Several village elders have said that the Australian patrols that
  came did not pronounce the name correctly, but the people were afraid to correct the white men. In
  fact, they themselves began using the white men’s pronunciation of Baiberi. That is the pronunciation
  the SIL team heard until 1992, when inhabitants began to revert to the original Baifeni.

  Laycock (1981) shows a village called ‘New Kwomtari’ on the Bapi River, west of the Sukura. That
  village site has been abandoned for several decades, although it is still considered part of the language
  area.

about 200 metres, on a ridge on the south-east side of the Yagroner Hills, above the
Senu River. From there the Senu River flows southwards into the Yalë language area.
The sixth Kwomtari-speaking village, Yaur, is situated on the Ketik River about eight
kilometres east of Baifeni. Refer Map 3, which shows the geography of the language
area.

1.2 The Kwomtari people
1.2.1 Traditional way of life
    The Kwomtari people are traditionally hunter-gatherers. In 1989, the people had
recently begun planting gardens. Bananas, sweet potato, taro, pawpaw, pumpkin,
sugarcane, pitpit4 and corn, along with various greens (e.g. tulip, aibika)5 were4
  Pitpit (TP): A type of wild sugar cane (Saccharum spontaneum), resembling an unripe ear of corn, and
  eaten as a source of starch. (Definitions of Tok Pisin (Melanesian Pidgin) terms are generally based on
  those in Mihalic 1971).
5
  Tulip (TP): A tree with paired edible leaves (Gnetum gnemon); aibika (TP): a plant with edible leaves
  (Abelmoschus manihot).
6                                                                           Introductionplanted in their gardens. Watermelon, pineapples and cucumbers are more recent
additions to the various local fruits. Coconut and betel nut palms grow in and around
the villages. Sago, the main staple of their diet, grows unaided in the swamps. Most
families live off their own garden produce and what they forage from the rainforest
with minimal need for cash. The men hunt with bows and arrows, bringing home wild
pig and cassowary meat, which are usually shared with the entire village. Smaller
catches, such as possums, snakes, lizards, birds, and bush rats, are eaten within each
family unit. Crocodiles are also hunted for their meat and hide. The villages further to
the south hunt small deer. Other sources of protein include various nuts, grubs and
fowl eggs. At times people catch young pigs and cassowaries to raise in the village,
either for a feast or as a source of income.
     Clans are patrilineal. There are recognized clan leaders within each clan.
Leadership is passed down to the oldest male within the clan. Clans continue to be a
very significant part of the social structure. Marriages are made in order to strengthen
relationships between clans, and are arranged by the male relatives of both parties. A
sister exchange may not be arranged within the same clan. Two instances are known
in which a man married someone from within his clan; both were met by opposition
from other clan members and the community at large. Arranged marriages remain the
norm, but the age of marriage for girls has risen to about the 16-20 year age range, as
opposed to 13-16 years. Generally, if a girl is in school, parents will postpone
marriage. It is common for a man to have two wives. A man will also marry his
brother’s widow.
    The Kwomtari are animistic. Their fear of spirits permeates their way of life
affecting their daily actions and responses to people. Spirits are neither good nor bad,
having the ability to do good or to harm. Uppermost in the minds of the people is the
need to avoid offending either an individual, who could hire a sorcerer, or the spirits
themselves, and to know how to appease them. A sorcerer has the ability to
manipulate the spirits and can be paid for his services. Sickness and death are most
often attributed to a spiritual attack. The use of magic to counteract evil and sickness
is commonplace. Ceremonial dances (singsings in Tok Pisin), with their elaborate
preparations, are still performed to appease the spirits when someone is very ill. They
are also much enjoyed as a community activity, viewed as harmless in this context,
perhaps as a way of passing on the tradition.
    Some vivid observations on Kwomtari culture in 1989 were made by Landweer
and Toivanen:
Introduction                                                                                        7         There is both material and behavioural evidence of a continuing
         traditional culture.
         There were longhouses in each village, which except for the
         occasional nailed ladder, were entirely constructed of bush materials.
         With the exception of one ‘western styled two storey’ house in
         Yanebi (now abandoned in severe decay), all the houses were of
         traditional fashion; windowless with two or more doors, a high
         morota roof with long overhanging eaves, ‘sewn’ pangal walls and
         limbum floors.6 The houses were built on posts anywhere from 4 to 8
         feet [i.e. 1.2 to 2.4 metres] off the ground and are typically entered by
         notched log ladders. In addition to the family centred longhouses,
         each village had a young unmarried man’s house, and haus win.7 Of
         the latter structures one in Wagreni was set up for women’s
         communal cooking.
         Inside the houses one sees a collection of traditional hunting,
         gathering and cooking implements: bows, arrows, spears (often
         highly decorated and diversified in fashion according to intended
         function); fishing nets (umbens), loosely woven baskets, tree branch
         hooks, and bark string bilums8. Other miscellaneous items noted are
         pigs, croc[odile] and cassowary skulls or bones; limbum flower
         brooms, and singsing bilas9 including shields and bird feathers.
         About ¼ of the women wear purpurs of twisted saksak fibre.10 At
         least 90% of the female population had facial tattoos, which we were
         told were applied when they were children according to the desired
         design of their mothers…
         Western material evidenced included occasional nails, second hand
         clothing (worn from about 8 years up), one broken hammer head, one6
   Morota (TP): Thatch shingles made of sewn sago palm or nipa palm leaves. Pangal (TP): The sago
   palm leafstalk or stem, used for making walls. Limbum (TP): The type of palm (Kentiopis
   archontophoenix) which is used for flooring and sometimes for the walls of houses; also the flower
   sheath of the palm, used for mats, buckets, baskets and for wrapping things.
7
   Haus win (TP): A structure with a thatched roof but no walls, for resting in the heat of the day.
8
   Umben (TP): A net for fishing or hunting. Bilum (TP): The netbag used as a carry-all, especially by
   women, throughout New Guinea.

   Singsing bilas (TP): Decoration worn at a ceremonial dance.
10
   Purpur (TP): A ‘grass skirt’. Saksak (TP): the sago palm (Metroxylon sagus or M. rumphii).
8                                                                            Introduction            saw, files, pieces of metal in spear heads, aluminium pots, dishes,
            spoons, knives and bush knives.
            Behavioural evidences of continuing traditional culture include the
            use of magic by some to counteract evil and sickness as well as that
            for hunting and fishing. Singsings are local and sung in tok ples.11
            Traditional stories are known and told by those of Sukwari’s
            generation (45+). There is some segregation of men and women’s
            duties as well as of living quarters (among young unmarried men)
            and sleeping quarters (within the familial longhouses).
    Nineteen years later there is still material and behavioural evidence that a
traditional culture remains intact. Development has not impacted traditional lifestyle
as much in the Kwomtari area as in other parts of PNG that are closer to towns and
have road access. Much of this is expected to change in the near future when the
planned timber operations begin.
    House construction has changed very little. Nails are preferred in the main
supporting beams and in the construction of ‘rung’ ladders as opposed to the
traditional notched log. The latter are still often used for the cookhouse, where some
of the women prefer to do their cooking. Many of the houses now have a shuttered
opening like a window to let in light during the day, but it would never remain open
for the night for fear of spirits. Most families still follow the traditional pattern of
segregated sleeping areas on separate sides of the longhouse around their own
firepits. The young unmarried men’s house perhaps shows the greatest change. In
Baifeni village this longhouse is separated into individual rooms with padlocks on the
doors.
     The interior of the houses, with their collections of traditional items, remain much
the same. Added to the Western items, one now sees mosquito nets and occasionally
mattresses and bedsheets, along with electric torches and kerosene lamps. Each
village would have at least one radio.
1.2.2 Church History
     The Christian Missions in Many Lands (CMML) began work in the Amanab sub-
district (including the Kwomtari language area) in the late 1950s. The CMML is the
missionary arm of the Christian Brethren Assemblies, which in Papua New Guinea is
called the Christian Brethren Church (CBC). CBC churches were set up in Kwomtari,
Yanebi and Baifeni villages by a man from Baifeni called Sukwari Yeta, who became11
     Tok ples (TP): Vernacular language, i.e. Kwomtari.
Introduction                                                                                    9a strong leader both within the churches and culturally as a village leader. The CBC
has been the only denomination active in this area. Some other groups such as the
Jehovah’s Witnesses and PNG Revival Church, as well as a cargo cult group, have
come into the area briefly, but they have not lasted long.
1.2.3 Transportation
    There are no roads. Travel is generally by foot, along bush trails. Villages are
located on average two to four hours hiking distance from Baifeni, the central village.
The villages of Baifeni and Kwomtari maintain a ‘log trail’ through the sago swamp
between their territories.
     The Kwomtari people do not have a tradition of building canoes. However, in the
late 1980s a Yalë man carved some canoes for the language group. As with most
skills, young men learned by observation, then trial and error. The number of canoes
remains minimal and their use limited to river crossings and short trips up or
downstream, mostly to transport garden produce or people when the river rises. The
recent introduction of canoes is evidenced in the borrowing of the Yalë word for
canoe, brau.12 (Canoes are also called brai, from a kind of seed-pod similar in shape.)
     There is an airstrip at Kwomtari, four kilometres south-west of Kwomtari village.
This was built by the Australian administration prior to 1974. More recently, another
airstrip was opened at Yanebi in 2003; however the people have had difficulty
maintaining it.
1.2.4 Health
    The health of the Kwomtari people has gradually improved since 1989, health
teaching being largely responsible for the change. The main illnesses are malaria,
pneumonia, tropical ulcers, boils and yaws. There is no known case of AIDS at the
time of writing.
    There was an aid post located at the Kwomtari airstrip in the early 1990s. The
Aid Post Officer was said to make medical rounds if someone was particularly ill and
unable to get to the aid post. After his death the post was not refilled. The people
must now leave the language area for medical assistance: an aid post is located at
Guriaso (10 kilometres east of Yaur); Utai (19 kilometres upstream from Yaur) has a
Catholic mission station, which has better facilities and has trained nurses; and the
12
     [Editors’ note] Brau is itself probably a loan from Malay perahu. See the discussion of Malay
     borrowings in languages of this area by Seiler (1985:226-229).
10                                                                           Introductiongovernment station at Amanab (17 kilometres west of Kwomtari) also has a hospital
with trained nurses.
1.2.5 Wealth and income
     There are very limited number of sources of income within the Kwomtari
language area. Market produce is a possibility; however the nearest market, Amanab,
is a full day’s walk away through sago swamp. Smoked meat brings a fair market
price but takes away protein from people who already have a protein-deficient diet.
Some families grow tobacco near their houses and will sell the tobacco braids to
neighbouring language groups. During the drought of 1996, several men were able to
sell crocodile skins, but this is not a regular source of income. It was difficult to get
the skin to market in prime condition, as it was a five day walk to Vanimo, the
provincial capital. As of April 2008, men can reach Vanimo in two days, getting a
ride on the timber company vehicles. Clothes, salt, pots, and garden tools are the
things they would buy with cash. They are willing to spend money on school fees, but
these are very high relative to their income.
    Until recently there were no cash crops, aside from tobacco. A few men took a
course on growing vanilla, and several villages now have vanilla gardens. However,
the price of vanilla had dropped before they were able to reap the benefits. One man
harvested a crop of soybeans but then found it difficult to get them to Vanimo to sell.
    There are a few trade stores within the language group but they have very limited
supplies. Two men in Baifeni village run a ‘literacy’ trade store whose profits help
pay for workshops and literacy materials.
    The people see a large influx of money, i.e. from the timber company, as the
answer to many of their problems (lack of health care, inadequate schools, lack of
basics such as clothing, kerosene, clean water supply, etc.). Unfortunately, most
spend money as quickly as they receive it. Money is shared within the clan the same
as any other commodity.
1.2.6 Linguistic vitality and education
    The people think highly of their language. Most women marrying into the
language group learn to speak Kwomtari. Although Tok Pisin is becoming stronger in
the area, Kwomtari is still the predominant language in almost every social situation,
except when speaking to outsiders. Many Tok Pisin terms and phrases tend to get
mixed into their speech. In church services, once the scripture has been read from the
Tok Pisin Bible, the preaching is either done in Tok Pisin then in vernacular, or in the
vernacular only. They have begun to use those portions of scripture already translated
Introduction                                                                           11in their services with much affirmation from the people – most of these being women.
The community schoolteacher is an outsider and uses Tok Pisin. Although English is
used at school, the children are never heard conversing in English.
    Tok Pisin is seen as a means of better opportunities outside the language area. It
will be needed to get work with the timber company when it comes. A definite
majority of men know Tok Pisin, and now many of the women as well are learning it.
     Educational levels among the Kwomtari are low, and consequently so is literacy.
Currently there are about fifteen grade 10 leavers, only one of whom has completed
grade 10 since the 1990s. Tok Pisin schools were established by the CMML mission
at various times; one was operating for women in Yaur but the teacher died in 2007.
Community schools have also operated at various times in the area, but have had
difficulties retaining teachers; they are currently operating in Mango and Guriaso.
There is a proposal to move the community school to Yanebi, but unless the people
come up with a plan to maintain the airstrip there this will not happen. Many people
view education as a positive thing and see it as a means to getting development,
perhaps more so now that the timber company operation is so near to beginning in
this area.","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"

8.2.4 Recapitulation
    Whereas in a complex sentence the order of events is specified, the adverb eese
(see §5.4) is sometimes used in a simpler coordinate sentence in order to be less
specific. Clauses are simply juxtaposed, then a form of the verb ‘do’ (-le or -a) is used
with the adverb eese, which generically recapitulates the events of the previous
clauses.
      (16) Kosi          fale-ie    pisu fale-ie       i    fale-ie

             ‘She cooked sago paste, sago pancakes and greens and gave them to me -
             she did like this.’
    In the following example, the manner adverb ange ‘try’ of the recapitulated
clauses occurs again in the final generic recapitulating clause.
      (18) Heremene mei katupulu ange prubunale-lee ange
            Herman        also log         try    jump.over-3S.R try

    Kwomtari has two verbs which can introduce a quotation. The most common is
ne ‘say’, which is used for both direct and indirect quotations. In all cases where ne is
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                    157used, it is given appropriate subject/status and object suffixes, which indicates the
independent nature of the clause and the coordinate nature of the sentence. This verb
has the form ne when occurring without an addressee, and na when an addressee is
stated: in this case the addressee is always referenced with object marking on the
verb. Examples (19) - (21) below illustrate this point; in (19) and (20) no addressee is
specified, but there is an explicit addressee in (21).
      (19) Te eete-geni lufwa menegu fura-le-fo-lee-ke                         eese

             people from - people that are praising?”’
      (20) Te ne-ne,             “Wa-bu-o          aie        eke-tie      ite-i

             1NPL see-1S.IR
             ‘He said to brother Agai, “OK, give it to me, first I want to see.”’
    Direct quotations are almost always preceded by ne, as in (21) above; sometimes
the object noun phrase occurs between the verb and the quote. Some quotations have
ne both preceding and following, as in example (22) below. The second instance of ne
can be interpreted as tail-head linkage, i.e. the beginning of the following clause
recapitulating the substance of the preceding clause. The adverb eese ‘thus’ may
occur with ne either preceding or following the quotation:
158                                                                  Kwomtari Grammar      (22) Na-te-ie,        “Libu, nali afteli        afteli    na-mo-lee-ke

           ‘I said to them, “Libu, he told us to hurry, then we tracked it.” I was
           saying (this) to them, and …’
   Only short quotations may occur with ne following rather than preceding. One
example appears in (23):
    (23) … busmani-le wo-fane-te-ie-ke,
               clan-GL    DIR.AWAY-give.S-3P.O-1S.R-SEQ

            ‘… I gave (some) to a clan and they asked me, “Who shot the pig?”’
    The other quotative verb is fie ‘ask’. Fie always precedes the quotation, as in (24)
and (25) below. The verb ne ‘say’ can also be used when a question is asked, rather
than fie.
      (24) Fie-fo-ie,       “Fori akei-e?”
            ask-3S.O-1S.R pig        where-EXC
            ‘I asked him, “Where’s the pig?”’
      (25) Te Kaspare fie-te-lee,             “Une-bo         glefe pruele-mo-lu?”

            ‘And Casper asked them, “Why did you (pl) flee?”’
     In continuous speech, quotations may not be separately marked; the hearer is
expected to keep track of the participants. Indirect quotations of speech or thought are
formed with ne ‘say’; ne follows the indirect quotation. These are formed like direct
quotes, but 1st person irrealis markers are used on quoted verbs. This use of the
morpheme -fe displays a link between its two meanings of reason and 1st singular
irrealis. Here, as well as encoding an indirect quote, it also displays the semantic
notion of purpose. In fact, -fe in both of its semantic senses is regularly used to
encode purpose (see §3.3.5).

    Complex sentences contain one or more dependent clauses, together with an
independent clause. They are conjoined by the suffixes -ke ‘SEQ’, -i ‘SIM’ or a
conjunction. The final, independent clause is the only one which may be marked
either for realis or irrealis status. Preceding clauses are marked with default realis
status, but in fact take their status from the final clause.
8.4.1 Complex sentences encoding temporal relations
    Complex sentences encoding temporal relationships manifest dependent clauses
that fit into two categories, depending on the final verb suffixation: (a) some take the
sequential suffix -ke (SEQ), which indicates that the marked clause refers to an event
preceding the one in the next clause; (b) others take the simultaneous suffix -i (SIM),
indicating that the marked clause refers to an event overlapping in some way with the
one in the next.
   The functions of these suffixes have been discussed in §4.2.9. I give a few more
examples here:
    (27) Wa-ie-ke,       inegu pa-fo-ie-ke,         klifu-lu
           go-1S.R-SEQ earth dig-3S.O-1S.R-SEQ ankle-NN
            fu-po-fo-ne-ke                 boleta-fo-ie.
            tie-DISTR-3S.O-1/3P.S-SEQ lift-3S.O-1S.R
            ‘After I went, after I dug the ground (where the pig had died), after we
            tied its ankles, I lifted it.’
    Note that in example (28) below, only the final verb is marked for its actual
status, irrealis. The preceding verbs are marked as realis even though they have
similar irrealis meaning to the final verb. However the sequential and simultaneous
suffixes mark them as medial (dependent) verbs which take their status from the final
verb.
      (28) Lulua-lu-ke,            lai-la-ne-i                gugu
             RED.put.P-2S.R-SEQ remain-P.DUR-1/3P.R-SIM hole

             ‘After you have stacked them (posts), then while they’re there, you’ll dig
             holes (for putting house posts in).’
     The use of aspect in complex sentences is not yet fully understood. In discourse,
it is used for foregrounding and backgrounding events (see §10 ‘Discourse Level’). I
160                                                                 Kwomtari Grammarhave not been able to find a difference in meaning between when -la ‘P.DUR’ is used
in the medial clause and when -me ‘D.DUR’ is used. I assume there is a difference, but
longer exposure to the language would be needed to clarify this. Table 17 shows what
meanings are currently understood to be obtained in complex sentences where the
medial clause has EITHER durative aspect (-la or -me). The first column of the table
gives the status of the whole sentence; the second column gives the final suffix on the
medial clause; the third column shows which type of durative aspect (proximal or
distal) appears on the final clause; the last column gives the understood meaning of
the sentence. Note that M = medial clause, F = final clause.

"4.1 Verb Stems
4.1.1 Common verb stems
    Verbs are formed by adding suffixes to the verb stem. Table 8 lists some common
Kwomtari verb stems; the four verbs on the lefthand side are the most frequently
used, and also function as auxiliary verbs in compound verb constructions (see
discussion below).
                             TABLE 8: BASIC VERB STEMS                     le     ‘do’              fie    ‘hear/ask’
                     a      ‘do’              feta   ‘see’
                     ne     ‘say’             fo     ‘eat’
                     la     ‘remain’          lu     ‘sleep’
                                              ri     ‘come’
                                              wa     ‘go’
    Examples (1) and (2) show how verb stems take suffixes to form complete verbs:
      (1) Lufwa fie-fo-ne,         “Mare-na pe?”
          man ask-3S.O-1/3P.R all-word POSB
          ‘The men asked him, “Is that true?”’                                         98
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                       99       (2) Mene fo-me-ie-ke                wa-fe.
           1NPL eat-D.DUR-1S.R-SEQ go-1S.IR
           ‘(In a while,) I’ll eat and then go.’
    The distinction between the two verbs glossed ‘do’ (le and a) is not a clear one.
My impression is that le is more transitive (Hopper and Thompson 1980), with the
agent being high in volitionality. This contrasts with a, which is intransitive and has
an agent low in volitionality, as is the case in the following two examples:
       (3) Mene fife-le          le-la-ie.
            1NPL faeces-GL do-P.DUR-1S.R
            ‘I’m defecating.’

            cassowary baby faeces do-P.DUR-1/3P.IR
            ‘The baby cassowaries will be defecating.’
    In (3), the actor is human and therefore higher in volitionality than the
cassowaries in (4). In support of this analysis, note that fife ‘faeces’ in (3) takes the
goal suffix -le. In (4) the same word lacks the goal suffix, and so is apparently
partially incorporated in the verb.
    The difference in transitivity becomes clearer when used with impersonal
constructions (see §4.1.4). In (5), the hunger is acting on the affected person. In (6),
the hunger is entirely inside the experiencer, and there is nothing acting.
       (5) Gife       le-o-la-lee.

            ‘I’m hungry.’ (Lit. ‘I’m acting on account of hunger.’)
4.1.2 Compound verbs
    There are two types of compound verbs:
       a. those terminating in one of the four verbs given in the first cell of table 8;
       b. those formed with the noun na ‘word’ and a verb stem.
100                                                                  Kwomtari Grammar      a. Type 1 Compound verbs
     This first type of compound verbs are formed with a noun and one of the four
basic verb stems given in the first column of table 8. Compounds formed in this way
vary according to how bonded the noun and the verb are. For some, the noun and the
verb stem form one intonational word, as in the compound verbs listed in table 10.
With others, the noun and verb are separate intonational words. Verbs formed with le
‘do’ or ne ‘say’ greatly outnumber those formed with a ‘do’ or la ‘remain’. Only
scattered examples of verbs formed with these latter two have been found. The
examples given for a in table 9 may have originally been repetitive aspect
constructions, the first being used in the reciprocal sense (since apure-apure-a ‘fight
each other’ must occur with plural subject). In fact, apure ‘fight’ is obligatorily used
in reduplicated form. Similarly, paiepaie ‘be happy’ cannot be split.

questionable.1 Are they actually verbal compounds (incorporations) or are they verb
phrases? They are usually tightly knit together in one intonational unit, but other
words like feti can intervene between the nominal and le (11).

      Example (11) shows a similar problem with a compound verb formed with a:
       (11) Inali    ari metie mena-fe paiepaie feti a-po-ne.

    Table 10 lists some verbs formed with the noun stem na ‘word’. The first three
words in the table are examples of verbs formed from na ‘word’ alone, with a specific
verb stem. Other compound verbs are formed with a noun terminating in na, and a
verb stem either le or ne – refer to the following cells in the table.

4.1.3 Inherently singular and plural verbs
    Some verbs have different singular and plural forms. Plural is marked according
to an ergative-absolutive orientation, i.e. the plural form of an intransitive verb marks
plural subject, while the plural form of a transitive verb marks a plural patient. The
verbs with different plural forms found so far are listed in table 11.
                       TABLE 11: SINGULAR AND PLURAL VERB FORMS      Singular form            Plural form          English gloss       Agrees with

    In many of these examples, there is no obvious relationship between the singular
and plural form. However, note that several of the plural verbs are formed with -nu.
In the last two verbs, the plural form is created by reduplication of the initial
syllable.2
       The following examples show verb stems alternating for singular and plural.
        (12) Fori silu fale-ie-ke               te    ite-i

               ‘He shot it and the pig died.’

               ‘If we shoot lots of bats in the night…’
2
    [Editors’ note] Additionally note the following verbs where reduplication is used to give a distributive
    meaning: rine ‘they come’, ririane ‘they come from many locations’; wane ‘they go’, wawane ‘they go
    to many locations’.
104                                                                   Kwomtari Grammar    In (16) the singular verb for ‘give’ is used with a singular patient but a plural
recipient; in (17) the plural verb is used with a plural patient but a singular actor and
recipient. This demonstrates that this pair of verbs is aligned with the patient, not the
recipient.

4.1.4 Impersonal verbs
    There are a number of impersonal compound verbs. These consist of a noun and
either the verb le ‘do’ or the verb ne ‘say’. It is not clear whether the noun is the
subject of the verb or whether an arbitrary ‘it’ is; in any case, the grammatical actor is
non-human.
      So far, five examples have been found in the corpus but there may well be more:
       (18) Gife        le-o-la-lee.
               hunger do-1/2S.O-P.DUR-3S.R
               ‘Hunger is doing to me = I’m hungry.’
       (19) Rafu              le-o-la-lee.
               perspiration do-1/2S.O-P.DUR-3S.R
               ‘Perspiration is doing to me = I’m hot.’
       (20) Fweelu le-o-la-lee.
               blood do-1/2S.O-P.DUR-3S.R
               ‘Blood is doing to me = I’m bleeding.’
       (21) Yelu          le-o-la-lee.
               satiation do-1/2S.O-P.DUR-3S.R
               ‘Fullness is doing to me = I’m not hungry.’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                   105     (22) Titiri ne-o-la-lee.
          pain say-1/2S.O-P.DUR-3S.R
          ‘Pain is speaking to me = I’m in pain.’
    Impersonal verbs used in causative constructions are interesting. Normally a
V-ri-fe (V-NOM-RSN) construction indicates that the nominalised verb is the motive
for the main verb and has the same subject-actor as the main verb (see §3.3.5 and
§4.2.8). But when used with an impersonal verb construction, the one performing the
action referenced by the nominalised verb is the patient, not the actor, of the main
verb.
      (23) Tetie-me-ege,        yeferale-ri-fe    robo-i      feti
            enough-CER-EXC fall.S-NOM-RSN close-LOC very
            le-o-la-lee-e,                ake-le-fe?
            do-1/2S.O-P.DUR-3S.R-EXC how-do-1S.IR
            ‘Enough! It (pain) is causing me to fall very soon, what shall I do?!’
    Example (23) is taken from a text where the storyteller was climbing a tree to
escape a pig but his limbs were too painful and he felt he couldn’t hold on any longer
– this is what he cried out to his friend. Here, pain is not simply ‘speaking’ but is
actively ‘doing’ (hence use of le).
4.1.5 Existential verbs
    Kwomtari has no copular verb but it does have ways of saying that things exist,
using various verbs. The most commonly used existential verb is la ‘remain’. This is
closest to the copula in meaning; it indicates that something is really present, rather
than abstractly existing; and in a specific location (though this may not be explicitly
expressed). La is also unusual in having slightly different forms for plural animates
and inanimates; animates use la (example (24)), but inanimates use lai (25):
      (24) Lufwa are ite-i              la-la-ne.
             man two house-LOC remain-P.DUR-1/3P.R
             ‘Two men are in the house.’
      (25) Lulua-lu-ke             lai-la-ne-i                 gugu
             RED.put.P-2S.R-SEQ remain-P.DUR-1/3P.R-SIM hole
             pue-po-fwa-le.
             dig-DISTR-MOT.AWAY-2S.IR
             ‘After you have stacked them (logs), while they are remaining there,
             you’ll dig holes.’
106                                                                Kwomtari Grammar    La is only used for movable entities. Entities that are firmly placed and
immovable (e.g. houses, trees, standing plants) are said to ‘stand’ rather than simply
‘remain’. But note that the verb teme ‘stand’ can be used with any noun under
appropriate conditions.
     (26) Pita-lu       ite   bwakei ka keri           teme-la-lee.
            Peter-NN house close        tree ficus     stand.S-P.DUR-3S.R
            ‘Near Peter’s house there’s a ficus (rubber) tree.’
    It is also possible to use the verb a ‘do’ in similar ways to la for animates,
indicating more motion on the part of the subject. So example (27) would be more
natural than the equivalent sentence using la, as cassowaries do not remain still.
      (27) Gwaie         ambo-i      a-la-ne.
             cassowary bush-LOC do-P.DUR-1/3P.R
             ‘There are cassowaries in the bush.’4.2 Verbal affixation

4.2.1 Subject suffixes
    Subject suffixes are the only obligatory markers on the verb. Subject marking has
a nominative-accusative orientation; the subjects of intransitive verbs (28) and (30)
receive the same suffixes as the corresponding actors of transitive verbs (29) and
(31):
      (28) Fori te, tafi-la-lee.
            pig FOC death-remain-3S.R
            ‘The pig died.’
      (29) Te Sione na-fo-lee…
            FOC John say-3S.O-3S.R
            ‘John said to him…’
      (30) … ame rame-le-le.
                wait know-do-2S.IR
            ‘…soon you will know how.’
      (31) Te lufwa lufwa-le burule burule a-te-le.
            FOC man       man-GL surpass surpass do-3P.O-2S.IR
            ‘You will surpass all the men.’
   Kwomtari has two sets of subject suffixes, which are portmanteau morphemes
combining person, number and status.4 These are listed in table 13 below.5
                               TABLE 13: SUBJECT/STATUS SUFFIXES                                     Realis Status        Irrealis Status
                       SG 1          -ie                  -fe
                          2          -lu                  -le
                          3          -lee                 -be
                       PL 1/3        -ne                  -bile
                          2          -mo                  -bule4
  The term ‘status’ is defined by Foley and Van Valin (1984:213-220). [Editors’ note] Other grammars
  use the term ‘mood’, ‘mode’ or ‘modality’ to cover the concept (Chung and Timberlake 1985; Payne
  1997; Palmer 2001).
5
   [Editors’ note] Note that ‘plural’ in the semantics of verbs signifies ‘two or more’, in contrast to
  pronouns, where it signifies ‘more than two’.
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                       109    The first set of subject suffixes, the default set, is used for all dependent verbs and
final verbs that have happened or are happening – past or present. This set is labelled
‘realis’, since on final verbs it indicates the reality of an event.
      (32) Nanu ite          tu-lee.
              3.PN house build-3S.R
              ‘He built a house.’
      (33) ka telu ambo-i              teme-po-fwa-ne-lu
              tree some bush-LOC stand.S-DISTR-MOT.AWAY-1/3P.R-NN
              ‘some trees that stand about in the bush’
    The second and less used set is labelled ‘irrealis’. It occurs only on final verbs
and marks events that have not occurred, including all future events, whatever their
certainty. It is also used to mark an ability on the part of someone to do something.
Compare (34) with (32) above:
      (34) Nanu ite          tu-be.
              3.PN house build-3S.IR
              ‘He is able to build a house/he will build a house.’
      (35) Lufwa-le ari-le na-te-bule.
              man-GL boy-GL say-3P.O-2P.IR
              ‘You (pl) will tell the men and boys.’
    Whether irrealis status can be used for contrafactual constructions is unknown
because they are not found in the data corpus.
4.2.2 Object suffixes
    These mark patients and recipients, often cross-referenced on the noun with the
goal suffix -le. The object markers are listed in table 14.
                               TABLE 14: OBJECT SUFFIXES                                           Object Suffix
                               SG 1/2      -o
                                  3        -fo

                                  3        -te
    Examples (36) to (40) demonstrate the use of object suffixes:
110                                                                       Kwomtari Grammar      (36) Mwi le-tuwa-fo-la-ne-ke…

           ‘We tracked it and then…’
      (37) Nali feta-lee-lu     yesou-le       pilu-le-fo-lee.
           3.PN see-3S.R-NN something-GL mark-do-3S.O-3S.R
           ‘He drew something he saw.’
      (38) Eete-geni na       gle-fe      na-mo-la-ie?
           here-thing word what-RSN say-1/2P.O-P.DUR-1S.R
           ‘Why am I telling you (pl) this?’
    With ditransitive verbs (e.g. ‘give’), the object suffix references the recipient
rather than the patient. This is shown in (39) and (40):
      (39) Nanu una-ne ari            fane-o-be.
             3.PN 2.PN-GL child give.S-1/2S.O-3S.IR
             ‘She will give the child to you.’
      (40) … busmani-le wo-fane-te-ie-ke,
                 clan-GL        DIR.AWAY-give.S-3P.O-1S.R-SEQ
             “Fori ine prafe-lee-e?”            na-o-ne.
             pig    who shoot.S-3S.R-EXC        say-1/2S.O-1/3P.R
             ‘… I gave (some) to a clan, and they asked me, “Who shot the pig?”’
4.2.3 Accompanier prefix ife-
    The accompanier prefix ife- indicates the presence of something that is acted on,
for or with. It is similar to the object suffixes in that it refers to a patient. The prefix is
not person or number specific. Examples (41) and (42) show a patient being
referenced by the accompanier prefix:
      (41) Te yeu            na-fo-ne          eese-ife-a-me-ne.
             FOC laugh say-3S.O-1/3P.R thus-ACM-do-D.DUR-1/3P.R
             ‘We laughed at her, we were doing like that to her.’
      (42) Mene nia-nu            inali noune-ie-ke       ife-wa-ie.
             1NPL 1.PN-NN wife take-1S.R-SEQ ACM-go-1S.R
             ‘I got my own wife, then went with her/took her with me.’
   This accompanier prefix normally occurs with patients which are animate.
However, they may be dead, as in example (43) where a dead pig is being carried
home:
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                              111        (43) Nanu afue-lee-ke          ife-le-me-lee-ke
             3.PN carry-3S.R-SEQ ACM-do-D.DUR-3S.R-SEQ
             ife-le-me-lee-ke             ife-le-me-lee-ke…
             ACM-do-D.DUR-3S.R-SEQ ACM-do-D.DUR-3S.R-SEQ
             ‘He carried it and carried it on and on...’
    It can be prefixed internally in compound verbs, before the derivational verb for
type 1 compounds, and even before na ‘word’ for type 2 compounds (refer to
example (44)). Note that in this example ife- is used in conjunction with an object
marker to refer to the same patient:
      (44) Nia-ne sabu-ife-na-ne-o-lee-ke                 ka-me      pina-le-ie.
            1S.R-GL chase-ACM-say-say-1/2S.O-3S.R-SEQ tree-CER ascend-do-1S.R
            ‘It (pig) chased me and I climbed a tree.’
    It can also be used to mark a third argument of the verb. In example (45), the verb
stem fane ‘give’ requires a singular patient (see §4.1.3), which is therefore the water.
The plural object suffix -te on the following verb a ‘do’ references the cassowary
chicks which are the recipients of the verb, while the accompanier prefix ife- refers to
the water.
      (45) Meli-le-me       fane-fane ife-a-te-la-lu.
             water-GL-CER RED-give ACM-do-3P.O-P.DUR-2S.R
             ‘You keep giving them (i.e. cassowary chicks) water.’
4.2.4 Distributive suffix -po
    The distributive suffix -po is used to indicate that plural agents or patients
participate equally in the event. If the verb is transitive, then the distribution is over
plural patients, as in (46):6
      (46) Sebei-le i-fi          amblue-po-bile.
             bark-GL fire-LOC heat-DISTR-1/3P.IR
             ‘We will heat each piece of bark in the fire.’
    The suffix can also be used with a single patient acted on by a plural agent. In this
case, -po indicates joint action:
6
    Note that -po becomes -poo before the suffixes -ne, -la, -fwa and -mai, in accordance with the
    morphophonemic rules (refer to §6.2.3 of paper by Drew, this volume).
112                                                                     Kwomtari Grammar       (47) Are-me asine-poo-ne-ke…
            two-CER butcher-DISTR-1/3P.R-SEQ
            ‘The two (each of them) butchered it…’
     The suffix -po attaches immediately to the verb stem and is so tightly bound to it
that -po can undergo reduplication with the stem, as in (48):
      (48) Wokoo-i-le         teri-po       teri-po         a-lu-ke…
             village-LOC-GL carry-DISTR carry-DISTR do-2S.R-SEQ
             ‘You keep carrying (log after log) to the village..’
    If the verb is intransitive, then the distribution occurs over plural subjects. In this
case, -po is not so tightly bound to the verb stem, and any motion suffixes are placed
between the two:
      (49) Mareteku arefe-teri-po-ne.
             all          fly-MOT.TOWARD-DISTR-1/3P.R
             ‘They all (beetles) came flying.’
      The suffix -po also has a postpositional function (see §3.1.4).
4.2.5 Directional prefixes
    The directional prefixes indicate the location in which an event occurs, relative to
the deictic centre. They are distinct from the motion suffixes (see §4.2.6). As with the
accompanier prefix, these can precede the derivational verb stem of compound verbs.
The directional prefixes are:
        bo-      ‘above/upstream/east’
        ye-      ‘down/downstream/west’
        wo-      ‘nonspecific, indicating a certain distance away’
    Examples (50) - (53) show the directional prefixes being used with the emphasis
on the location of an event:
      (50) Te mai          ka are bo-bunene-lee.
             FOC on.top post two DIR.UP-stack-3S.R
             ‘He stacked two posts on top.’
      (51) Luwari-porite        luku-ye-le-ne-ke…
             downstream-place gather-DIR.DN-do-1/3P.R-SEQ
             ‘We gathered downstream…’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                 113     (52) Te     meli wo-rofo-lee-ke                   rie-lee    ite-i-le.

          and DU      go-1/3P.R-SEQ DIR.AWAY-see-3P.O-1/3P.R
          ‘We both went and we saw them there.’
    The prefixes are also used with verbs of perception:
     (54) Babli briebrie bo-ne-la-lee-fe                   te
            droplet drip       DIR.UP-say-P.DUR-3S.R-RSN FOC
            feta-fwa-lee           fori-le.
            see-MOT.AWAY-3S.R pig-GL
            ‘Drops were dripping above, so he looked and saw a pig.’
    In (55), the directional prefix indicates the location in which the outcome of an
action is to occur:
      (55) Guglu          bo-fatie-le.
              ridgepole DIR.UP-put.S-2S.IR
              ‘You will put up the ridgepole.’
   Examples (56) - (58) show that the directional prefixes can also be used for
motion entirely involving a subject:
     (56) Meli bo-le-lee-ke                 gena-po-lee-lu           na.
            river DIR.UP-do-3S.R-SEQ overflow-DISTR-3S.R-NN account

            DIR.AWAY-arrive.S-1S.R
            ‘I got the piglet, then I arrived at the house.’
4.2.6 Motion suffixes
    These suffixes mark the direction of motion or the area the event/state occurs
over. They are composed of a motion verb stem preceded by the morpheme -fe or -te.
114                                                                        Kwomtari GrammarGenerally, if the verb is a compound verb based on le ‘do’, the base is -te; if any other
verb, the base is generally -fe, although there are a few exceptions. Verbs using -te
seem to be less active verbs but investigation with more examples would be necessary
to pin this down precisely.
          The motion verb stems are:

     yere            ‘motion to the west7        fere ~ tere         ‘MOT.WEST/DOWN’
                     or vertically down’
     kumo            ‘motion to the east8        fwakumo ~           ‘MOT.EAST/UP’
                     or vertically up            tekumo
     luwa            ‘motion downstream’         feluwa ~ teluwa     ‘MOT.DOWNSTREAM’
     bula            ‘motion upstream’           febula ~ tebula     ‘MOT.UPSTREAM’
    The morpheme re (not yere) is used with -fe, -te for westward motion. The
following examples illustrate the normal usage of the motion suffixes:
      (59) Eete-geni gwaie           tia-fwa-lee-lu            mwa.
            here-thing cassowary flee-MOT.AWAY-3S.R-NN no

          ‘…call out to (the vine) upstream and (the vine) downstream, then throw

    These motion suffixes immediately follow the verb stem, except occasionally
where a -po ‘DISTR’ suffix occurs (compare example (63) above with (65) below).
Exceptions to this include the verbs tiale ‘flee’ and pipinane (=pipinale) ‘run’, which
lose -le or -ne when -fwa is suffixed, becoming simply tiafwa and pipinafwa.
     The suffixes -fwa, -tuwa and -fere, -tere have taken on broader meanings. The
first pair can indicate that something occurs over a broad area without any motion
necessarily being involved, as in example (65):

    Kwomtari is seen to display aspect marking in three different ways. First,
durative aspect is marked on the verb; secondly, habitual aspect can be formed by a
serial verb construction; thirdly, repetitive aspect can be formed by a different serial
construction using reduplication.
    a. Durative Aspect
       -la    P.DUR (proximal durative)
       -me    D.DUR (distal durative)    Durative aspect signals that an event perseveres over an extended period of time.
Note that the proximal durative suffix -la is the same as and apparently derived from
the verb la ‘remain’. Table 16 below summarises the interaction of the durative aspect
markers with status marking on the verb in ordinary conversation.
           TABLE 16: INTERACTION OF DURATIVE ASPECT WITH STATUS MARKING      Aspect/status        Time of event
      marking
      -la + REALIS         event is ongoing now
      -la + IRREALIS       event will be ongoing soon, i.e. immediate future
      -me + REALIS         event went on for a while in the past
      -me + IRREALIS       event will go on for a while in the more distant future
    In extended discourse and in any complex sentence the situation is more
complex; see §8.4.1 for discussion. Examples (71) and (72) illustrate the use of the
proximal durative suffix with realis and irrealis status respectively, while examples
(73) and (74) illustrate the use of the distal durative suffix with realis and irrealis.

             ‘(After you have avoided eating what you kill for a while), you’ll keep
             beating (having the victory over) pigs, cassowaries and everything.’
      b. Habitual Aspect
    Habitual aspect is formed by a serial verb construction of the stem a ‘do’ with a
preceding stem specifying the habitual action. Each stem hosts its own subject/status
suffix. The relationship of the predicate to the time interval here is one of intermittent
occurrence, the time interval being extended indefinitely in either direction.

             fish shovel-NOM-RSN go-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R-NN account
             ‘Account of how we go to shovel fish.’
      c. Repetitive Aspect
    This aspect signals repeated occurrence over a restricted time interval. It can also
be used to encode a reciprocal relationship, where the event is repeated but with agent
and patient roles exchanged.
    Repetitive aspect is encoded by the pro-verb a ‘do’ in combination with a lexical
verb. The lexical verb is reduplicated totally or partially, and a fully inflected a ‘do’
follows it, forming a compound. In simple verbs, the whole stem is reduplicated.

          RED-shake.hand do-1/3P.R
          ‘they shake each other’s hands’
    With compound verbs the stem, minus the derivational stem, reduplicates (and
final a > e). In example (80), banane ‘angry’ is a compound verb: bana ‘anger’ + ne
‘say’. The derivational stem ne ‘say’ is dropped and the first stem bana becomes
bane. The same pattern occurs in (81) - (83):
      (80) bane-bana a-lee
             RED-angry      do-3S.R
             ‘she was cross’ (Lit. ‘she shouted over and over’)

             do-3P.O-2P.R-SEQ
             ‘Some of you do the baskets to keep pouring in the middle, then…’
   The reduplicated stem can also include the distributive suffix -po, as in (84):
    (84) Wokoo-i-le        teri-po-teri-po              a-lu-ke…
          village-LOC-GL carry-DISTR-carry-DISTR do-2S.R-SEQ
          ‘You keep carrying (log after log) to the village…’
   Alternatively the whole verb with subject markers can be repeated creating a
complex sentence:
120                                                                    Kwomtari Grammar         (85) Mwi le-tuwa-foo-la-ne-ke

              ‘We tracked it and tracked it and tracked it, then the dogs barked.’
4.2.8 Deverbal suffix10 -ri
    The deverbal suffix -ri derives a noun or non-finite form of the verb. The whole
verb phrase, including adverbs, goals and all suffixes preceding the subject, is
deverbalised and used in various constructions. The simplest is the straight use of -ri
on a verb to form a noun, as in (86) - (89):
      (86) kumo-ri
             move.east-NOM
             ‘east’
      (87) fo-ri
             eat-NOM
             ‘pig’
      (88) fie-ri
             hear/ask-NOM
             ‘a call/shout’
      (89) wa-ri
             go-NOM
             ‘walking’ (e.g. a person’s manner of walking)
    Any noun derived with this suffix may then become part of a compound as in
(90) and (91):
      (90) Boe rie-ri            afwi     metie oora-fw-ie.
            again come-NOM trail.LOC really seek-3S.O-1S.R
            ‘Again I looked for the coming-out-trail.’
      (91) Beni      tu-ri        teloo     le-o-la-lee.
            banana cook-NOM favourite do-1/2S.O-P.DUR-3S.R
            ‘Cooking banana is a favourite of mine.’
10
     This term is adopted from Anderson (1985).
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                  121    The suffix -ri used with -lu forms an adjective, as would be expected.
     (92) Ite        tu-ri-lu        na
            house build-NOM-NN account
            ‘an account of house-building’ (Lit. ‘a house-building account’)
     (93) Eete-geni meli ruke-ri-lu               ami mei riti-lu        feti le-lee.
            here-thing water shovel-NOM-NN way also heavy-NN very do-3S.R
            ‘This method of shovelling water is very heavy (hard).’
   The suffix -ri is often used with -fe ‘RSN’ to mark the reason or purpose of the
main verb (same subject is assumed).
     (94) Taure fale-lee-ke           meli rofo-ri-fe         wa-lee.
            towel get.S-3S.R-SEQ water bathe.S-NOM-RSN go-3S.R
            ‘He got his towel and went to wash in the river.’
     (95) Te mene wa-ie            mie feta-te-ri-fe.
            FOC 1NPL go-1S.R sago see-1/3P.O-NOM-RSN
            ‘I went to see the sago.’

            sago enclose-3S.O-NOM-RSN go-1/3P.R
            ‘They went to make a sago blind.’
    When the main verb is le ‘do’ this can indicate a desire to do something and when
used with proximal durative aspect gives an immediate future tense (similar to
English ‘I’m going to write/go/…’).
     (97) Mena-nu inali ari           lupole-lee-lu    na-le
            1.PN-NN wife child deliver-3S.R-NN account-GL

            ‘I’m going to write the account of how my wife had a baby.’
4.2.9 Verb final suffixes
    There are four suffixes which occur verb-finally on dependent verbs (see §8.4 for
discussion of the relationship between dependent and independent clauses). Two of
these are medial clause markers; one suffix is subordinating; and one suffix marks the
end of a negated clause.
    a. Coordinating Medial Verb Suffixes
    The following verb suffixes occur on medial verbs only:
122                                                                                   Kwomtari Grammar             -ke      ‘sequential’
             -i       ‘simultaneous’11
    Unlike many other Papuan languages with medial verbs, Kwomtari has no
switch-reference system. Both -ke and -i may express relationships between verbs that
have the same subject (example (98)) or verbs that have different subjects (example
(99)). Note that -ke occurs in all types of discourse, not just narrative texts.
      (98) Mare-me wa-ne-ke               feta-ne-ke         asine-ne-ke
             all-CER    go-1/3P.R-SEQ see-1/3P.R-SEQ butcher-1/3P.R-SEQ
             teri-po-ne             wokoo-i-le.
             carry-DISTR-1/3P.R village-LOC-GL
             ‘They all went, saw it (the pig), butchered it, and carried it to the village.’
      (99) Seise kakali yesou             tine-po-lee-ke           fo-po-ne-ke
             Seise food something give-DISTR-3S.R-SEQ eat-DSR-1/3P.R-SEQ
             te    aue kri-po-ne-ke                 wa-ne.
             FOC bag carry-DISTR-1/3P.R-SEQ go-1/3P.R
             ‘Seise gave us food, we ate it, we carried our bags and went.’
    The gloss ‘simultaneous’ does not cover the entire semantic range encoded by the
suffix -i. When the verb it occurs with is also marked with durative aspect (-la or
-me), it does mean simultaneous, in that the following verb occurs at the same time as
the marked verb (see example (100)). The verbal suffix -i can be considered similar to
the postposition -i, which binds a noun phrase to a particular location in space or
time. When no durative aspect is present, it marks a temporal contingency/condition,
similar to the English ‘when’. Used in sentences with realis status, its meaning is
similar to that of -ke, in that the marked verb is completed before the next verb
begins. But unlike -ke, which can be thought of as encoding the semantic notion of
English ‘after’, -i signals that the marked verb is an obligatory precondition for the
following verb to occur. Example (101) illustrates this. When a sentence has irrealis
status or is in the imperative mood, -i is used to express ‘when’ or ‘if’ that event
happens. This contrasts with -ke which marks a succession of events, the future
occurrence of the event being presumed. (See examples (102) and (103) below).
     (100) I       fufa-la-ie-i             Efesise sekale-lee.
             fire prepare-P.DUR-1S.R-SIM Ephesus arrive.S-3S.R
             ‘While I was making a fire, Ephesus arrived.’11
     Note that -i is not apparent when it immediately follows u (as with the 2nd singular realis suffix -lu);
     when -i follows the 3rd singular realis suffix -lee, -ee drops out and only -i is evident.
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                      123    (101) Nanu wa-ne-i           te   nuguli    kosi       fale-lee-ke

     Compare examples (102) and (103) below; the final verbs in both sentences have
irrealis status. In (102), the suffix -i is used to mark that shooting bats is a condition
for cooking them, gathering and eating them. In (103), which uses -ke, the shooting of
bats is presumed, and the cooking, gathering and eating will surely follow.

below illustrates its use.

      The particle -i, which may mark clauses as negated, is discussed in §7.2.
      (105) Mena-nu mie glei fo-la-ne-i.

              ‘They (pigs) aren’t eating my sago.’4.3 Verb phrase
    The verb phrase has the following constituents: (a) pre-verbal negator; (b) noun
modifiers to the verb, i.e. noun phrases that are intrinsically part of the verb, forming
nominal + verb compounds or tightly knit units; (c) core arguments of the verb (actor,
goals); and (d) oblique arguments of the verb (e.g. reason, location, instrument). The
verb phrase may constitute the entire clause (even sentential utterance).
    Order within the verb phrase is relatively free, with the exception that the verb
occurs last. Some orders are slightly more common and suggest the following as the
default ordering:
        (NEG) (GL PP) (RSN PP) (LOC PP) (COM PP) (Manner Adv) (Deictic Adv) V
     When the pre-verbal negator glei is present, it obligatorily intervenes between the
subject and the verb. This provides evidence for the existence of a verb phrase at a
separate level from the clause. Example (106) illustrates the obligatory ordering of
glei within the verb phrase:
     (106) Eete-geni lufwa glei Aie                Gote-le arie          nuboue
             here-thing man NEG father.1/2 God-GL stomach good
             le-fo-lee.
             do-3S.O-3S.R
             ‘This man didn’t love father God.’
   Examples (107) - (109) show the relative ordering of goals and instrument/
comitative PPs in the verb phrase:

                            5. Adverbs    Kwomtari has adverbs encoding the manner in which an event is performed,
general and specific temporal adverbs, negating adverbs, deictic adverbs, locational
adverbs and modal adverbs. This chapter describes first adverbs of manner (§5.1),
then temporal adverbs (§5.2), negators (§5.3), deictic adverbs (§5.4), locative adverbs
(§5.5) and finally modal adverbs (§5.6).","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136]"
"6.1 Morphophonemic variations affecting nouns
6.1.1 Locative suffix
   The locative suffix -i, affects the final vowel of the stem in some instances.
There are no changes for nouns ending in /ɛ/, /a/, or /ɔ/; the locative marker is
simply attached to the stem. Examples (1) - (3) illustrate this:
       (1)   /kriɛ + -i/                /kriɛi/         ‘in the night’
       (2)   /ku̞na + -i/               /ku̞nai/        ‘in the back’
       (3)   /ambɔ + -i/                /ambɔi/         ‘in the jungle’
   For nouns ending with lowered high vowels, the final vowel of the stem is
lowered to the low-mid front vowel. Examples are given in (4) and (5):
       (4)   /kɭi̞ + -i/                /kɭɛi/          ‘in the swamp’
       (5)   /uɔku̞ + -i/               /uɔkɛi/         ‘in the village’
     In words ending in diphthongs, the first vowel within the final vowel sequence
is affected, rather than the vowel directly preceding the locative marker.
     The locative suffix /-ɸi/ is an allomorph of /-i/. This allomorph can be suffixed
to any noun, without difference in meaning from /-i/ and without changing the
final vowel. Nouns ending in /i/ and /u/ obligatorily take /-ɸi/ as a suffix rather
than -i; for other nouns it is an optional alternative. Examples are given in (6) and
(7):                                         44
Kwomtari Phonology                                                                45      (6)   /riɭu + -ɸi/               /riɭuɸi/        ‘in the liver’
      (7)   /ɭutuɸi + -ɸi/             /ɭutuɸiɸi/      ‘in the hair’
     There seems to be no reason for preferring one allomorph over another, except
in the following instance:
      (8)   a. /buɭu̞ + -ɸi/           /buɭu̞ɸi/       ‘in the large intestine’
            b.*/buɭu̞ + -i/            /buɭɛi/
    Example (8b) is unacceptable, since it is identical in form with (9) below:
      (9)   /buɭɛ + -i/                /buɭɛi/         ‘in the basket’
    The morphophonemic changes resulting from suffixing -fi can be summarised
as follows:

                  u                      uɸi6.1.2 Pronoun suffixes
    Two suffixes occurring on nominals are -lu ‘noun-noun relator’, which in this
case references a possessor, and -le ‘goal’, which references an undergoer or
beneficiary. In both these suffixes l becomes n when affixed to first person (mna,
mne, nia) or second person pronouns (une), but does not change when affixed to
nouns or third person pronouns (nanu, nali). The examples in (10) show -lu in its
unconditioned state; the examples in (11) show the application of the
morphophonemic rule:
46                                                                          Kwomtari Phonology         (10)    a. /paɭiakɔ + -ɭu/            /paɭiakɔɭu/        ‘Paliako’s’
                 b. /nanu + -ɭu/               /nanuɭu/           ‘his / her / hers / their(s)’
                 c. /naɭi + -ɭu/               /naɭiɭu/           ‘his / her / their own’
         (11)    a. /məna + -nu/               /mənanu/           ‘my / mine’
                 b. /una + -nu/                /unanu/            ‘your / yours’
    Similarly, (12) and (13) show respectively the unconditioned and conditioned
forms of -le:
         (12)    a. /paɭiakɔ + -ɭɛ/            /paɭiakɔɭɛ/        ‘to Paliako’
                 b. /nanu + -ɭɛ/               /nanuɭɛ/           ‘to him/her’
                 c. /naɭi + -ɭɛ/               /naɭiɭɛ/           ‘to him / her / them’
         (13)    a. /məna + -nɛ/               /mənanɛ/           ‘to me’
                 b. /una + -nɛ/                /unanɛ/            ‘to you’
                     1
    Three nasals are not permitted in succession, so for the third person pronoun
nanu, the suffixes must revert to -lu and -le. The third person pronoun nali does
not fulfil the condition of the rule so the suffixes remain as -lu and -le.","[54, 55, 56]"
"5.1 Adverbs of manner
    Adverbs of manner generally precede the verb directly, but may be found in other
positions in the clause.

    Temporal adverbs have a greater tendency to occur clause-initially than other
adverbs. This is because the scope of the adverb generally covers one or more whole
clauses. Kwomtari has a number of general temporal adverbs which do not point to a
specific time but rather to a relative event time: a time setting in a discourse, or the
speech act time.
5.2.1 wolu ‘already’
    This adverb marks an event as already having occurred, relative to the speech act
time or temporal setting in a discourse.
       (8) Mene klifu wolu.
            1NPL dog already
            ‘I have a dog.’

    The adverb tatuke signals completive aspect. So far, tatuke ‘finish’ has only been
observed in sentences in which the final verb has irrealis status. Example (11) is from
a text describing how to build a house.
      (11) Ilekuli mwi le-te-lu-ke             inali      inegu
             fire.pit vine do-3P.O-2S.R-SEQ woman earth

              ‘After you have done the fire pit (with vines?), after the women have
              gathered earth, after you’ve finished the fire pit, you’ll do the door.’
      This adverb can accompany the verb used in tail-head linkage, as in (12):
       (12) Te kotukrie-me inali           fufru-ne-ne-i
              FOC dawn-CER        woman arise.P-say-1/3P.R-SIM

              pancakes, and then put them in their baskets, they will carry them away.’
5.2.3 boe ‘again’
   The adverb boe refers to a previous event and marks the current event as being in
some way a repeat of the previous.
     (13) Kotukrie-i feti boe Seise kakali yesou             tine-po-lee.

            ‘Again I looked for the coming-out-trail.’
See also example (17) below.
5.2.4 ame ‘still’/‘wait’
    The temporal adverb ame is used in two slightly different senses. In the first
sense, ame marks an event as still occurring, but soon to finish. This sense is found
when ame is used with realis events, as in the following two examples:
     (15) Kotukrie-i-me feti ame lie puna-le-ri                 preme le-la-lee…
           dawn-LOC-CER very still sun rise-do-NOM not                   do-P.DUR-3S.R
           ‘Early in the morning when the sun hadn’t risen yet...’
     (16) babi-fu        te    ame yemilu la-la-lee
           middle-ABL FOC still raw             remain-P.DUR-3S.R
           ‘the middle area (of the tree trunk) is still raw (hasn’t dried out yet)’
    In the second sense, an event is marked as soon to occur and glossed as ‘wait’.
This sense is found when the event has irrealis status.
      (17) Nuboue! Same-me pilu boe le-te-lu,                a-la-lu,
            good      thus-CER mark again do-3P.O-2S.R do-P.DUR-2S.R
            ame rame-le-le.
            wait know-do-2S.IR
            ‘Good! Make marks like that again and keep doing that and soon you will
            know (how to draw).’
   Ame is also used idiomatically as an imperative, meaning ‘wait’, or ‘hang on a
minute’:
     (18) Ame, Aie          Gote nali aikopi-le-be.
          wait father.1/2 God 3.PN help-do-3S.IR
          ‘Wait, father God will help us.’
5.2.5 bie ‘first’
    The event occurring with bie ‘first’ is always irrealis. It indicates that the event it
is modifying must be carried out before some other can occur. Note that, as in
example (20), bie can be attached to the verb, in which case, the final e is dropped.
130                                                                   Kwomtari Grammar       (19) Bie, aroo tekale-be.

            ‘Woponei, why are you doing that? First tell me!’
5.2.6 esulu ‘immediately’/‘next’
    The adverb esulu ‘immediately’ or ‘next’ indicates that the marked clause
follows, in time, immediately after the preceding clause.
      (21) Te besuka-lu bo-lua-lu-ke,                   bikoseku-lu esulu

5.3.1 mwa ‘no’
    The adverb mwa is a negative focus word, following the word, phrase or clause
that it marks. Mwa functions as a quantifier meaning ‘none’, sometimes following a
noun (29) or even a nominalised clause (30).
       (29) Mene klifu mwa.
            1NPL dog no
            ‘I don’t have a dog.’
       (30) Eete-geni gwaie         tia-fwa-lee-lu            mwa.
            here-thing cassowary flee-MOT.AWAY-3S.R-NN no
            ‘This cassowary didn’t run away.’
   After a negated clause an intonation break can occur, followed by mwa to
emphasise the negation.

              carry.away-DISTR-1/3P.R
              ‘We two didn’t eat (them), we just carried them away.’
      Mwa terminates clauses, indicating that the action referred to was unsuccessful.
       (32) Japert-lu yari-lu        mie-le           fie-fo-ie-i             mwa.
             Japert-NN father-NN sago.blind-GL listen-3S.O-1S.R-SIM no
             ‘(When) I listened at Japert’s father’s sago blind - no (didn’t hear
             anything).’
       (33) Ari wagu lufwa glei wa-bile,               mwa!
             child nook man not go-1/3P.IR no
             ‘Men mustn’t go to the child’s nook (birth place) - no!’
    Mwa is used in an exclamation with metie ‘really’, expressing extreme surprise:
meti mwa! ‘Wow!’
5.3.2 glei predicate negator
    The adverb glei ‘not’ negates the predicate and is usually found as the initial
element in the predicate. Glei can negate all the predicates linked to one subject, as in
(34). Glei is used in conjunction with the clause final negative suffix -i, which is
discussed further in §7.2.
      (34) Inalilufwa glei Pita-le rie-ne-ke                  feta-ne-a-ne-i.

            ‘This man didn’t love (?) God’ (Lit. ‘…didn’t do a good stomach to
            God’)
5.3.3 kose ‘lest’
    The adverb kose ‘lest’ occurs most commonly in negative imperatives along with
the prohibitive mani, as in example (36):
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                                  133        (36) Une kose biakwai-le-lu mani.
             2NPL lest drunk-do-2S.R PHB
             ‘You must not get drunk.’
   It can also occur in irrealis sentences without mani to express a hope that the
event will not occur.
     (37) Una-nu raroo             bofu        kose tafi-la-be.
            2.PN-NN brother.1/2 another lest death-remain-3S.IR
            ‘Lest one of your brothers die.’ (‘I don’t want one of your brothers to
            die.’)
   When kose is reduplicated and followed by -fe ‘RSN’, the resulting construction
means something is ‘fake’ or a ‘lie’:
    (38) Kose-kose-fe bwali-bwali         lete-fo-lee-ke…
          RED-lest-RSN RED-shell.ring do.them-3S.O-3S.R-SEQ
          ‘He made fake shell-rings1 for it (i.e. the snake – to catch it)…’5.4 Deictic adverbs
    Deictic adverbs are based on the morpheme se encoding approximation. They are
glossed ‘thus’ and either recapitulate the event or events or refer to them
cataphorically. The most commonly used deictic adverb is eese, with ee marking
close proximity, as it does in the demonstrative eete of §2.4. The unmarked se also
occurs quite commonly. The difference between eese and se in meaning and function
is not clear. The adverb is phonologically bound to the verb, so eese-a-lee is
pronounced eesalee.
      (39) Mena-nu bebrie-fu ambue             eese le-lee…

    today this term is used to mean “money”.

            ‘So I’m teaching you – if you are doing like that (previously mentioned)
            then some men will run away with you.’
    The adverb same may have been formed from se-a-me ‘APR-do-CER’. It clearly
has a related function but can occur more distant from the verb than (ee)se. The
current corpus of data contains two examples of eese and both seem more similar in
use to same than to eese.

    The locational adverbs are all locative postpositional phrases in form (formed
from nouns with the locative postposition -i). They are discussed separately here
according to their adverbial semantic use. They also act as locative postpositions
themselves (see §3.3.1). The most common locational adverbs are:
        mai              ‘on top, high’
        ambei            ‘under, low’
        menei            ‘inside’ ( < meni-i ‘hole-LOC’)
        bwakei ~ bagei ‘close’
        roboi            ‘close, soon’
        eetei            ‘here’ (this-LOC)
        utei             ‘over there’ (that-LOC)2
        tei              ‘here’ (a location just described) (FOC-LOC)
       The following examples show the locational adverbs in use:
        (46) Eete-i-se         teme-le-a!
               here-LOC-APR stand.S-2S.IR-EXC

               ‘The child is soon to be born.’ (Lit. ‘The child is close to doing to the
               woman.’)5.6 Modal adverbs
    The morpheme tie may have an exclamatory or modal function. It occurs in the
words metie ‘really’, ‘truly’ (< me ‘CER’+ tie) and tetie ‘enough’, ‘all right’ (< te
‘FOC’ + tie). Other than in these two words, there is only one instance of tie in the
current corpus of data. This occurrence is in eketie (< eke ‘there’ + tie). Both these
adverbs often lose their -e ending when closely linked with a postposition, for
example teti-pe, teti-mai, meti-mwa.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145]"

    Merekeilu is now largely replaced by nuboue (from ‘nambawan’ (TP))

    The various functions of -lu are discussed in §3.2.1.
60                                                                Kwomtari Grammar
    When the adjective follows the noun, -lu may be added even if -lu is already
present. Certainly in the case of colour terms, two tokens of -lu were always
acceptable. In (10), either (a) or (b) is acceptable:
     (10) a. lilu wi-lu
                 cloth red-NN
                 ‘red cloth’
             b. lilu wi-lu-lu
                  cloth red-NN-NN
                 ‘red cloth’
     The following are additional examples of colour adjectives in use:
      (11) bokelu kwaie
             yellow pandanus.fruit
             ‘yellow pandanus fruit’
      (12) lubulu lilu
             blue    shirt
             ‘blue shirt’
      (13) ti      umugilu
             rock black
             ‘black rock’
2.1.4 Compound nouns
    Two lexical nouns can be combined to form a third, compound lexical noun.
Kwomtari displays two types of noun compounds: modifier-modified compounds and
coordinate compounds. Both are types of endocentric compounds, meaning that the
entire compound has a function similar to that of one or more of the parts which
function as its elements.
     A modifier-modified compound is an endocentric compound having the second
element as its semantic centre. The first element of the compound serves as a
modifier to the second. Sometimes this expresses a whole-part relationship between
the two nouns, as in examples (14) and (16).
      (14) fwi        nagli-lu
            coconut base-NN
            ‘base of coconut tree’
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                            61
        (15) ipoe-ka
             head-tree
             ‘pillow’ (traditionally a piece of wood)
        (16) ri     tifilu
             body hair
             ‘feathers’
    A coordinate compound is an endocentric compound having both components as
the semantic centre. The following examples have been found:
      (17) inali-lufwa
            woman-man
            ‘people’
      (18) moo-yafi
            younger.brother-older.brother
            ‘brothers’
      (19) yefi-yari
            mother-father
            ‘parents’
2.1.5 Derived nouns
    Some nouns are derived from others by total reduplication, for example:
                          TABLE 3: NOUNS DERIVED BY REDUPLICATIONRoot         Gloss           Reduplicated form                           Gloss
kaliefu      ‘bird’          kakaliefu ~ kaliekaliefu ~ kaliefukaliefu   ‘butterfly’
klifu        ‘dog’           klifuklifu                                  ‘type of beetle’
koime        ‘trap-door      koimekoime                                  ‘smaller spider
             spider’                                                     (all kinds)’
     In each of the cases in table 3, the reduplicated form references a more diminutive
entity than the base form.
    Some nouns are derived from verbs by adding the deverbaliser/nominaliser -ri to
the verb stem, as examples (20) and (21) indicate.
62                                                                 Kwomtari Grammar

         (21) beni    tu-ri
              banana cook-NOM
              ‘cooking banana’
    Some are derived by using other suffixes, such as -me, ‘certainly’ and -se
‘approximation’5:
     (22) kuli-me
           leg-CER
           ‘centipede’
     (23) kuli-se
           leg-APR
           ‘leech’
   The morpheme -lu is very commonly used to create a noun which is a part of the
whole:
     (24) arie-lu
          stomach-NN
          ‘intestine’
     (25) besu-lu
          chest-NN
          ‘breastbone’
    There is a method for constructing ‘all sorts of X’, or ‘X after X’, using the focus
marker te. This is teX teX, as shown in the following examples. The functions of te
are discussed in §6.1.1.
      (26) te-ka        te-ka

2.2.1 Numerals
    Cardinal numbers are related to body parts. The following listing was given by
one speaker, but speakers differ, especially with the numbers six to nine. Note that
numbers 4 to 6 all end in -lu-tu ‘-NN-COM’, and the numbers 7, 8 and 9 are formed
from 6+1, 6+2 and 6+3.

          (33) mare                   ‘all, together’
                 mareteku             ‘all’
                 sai                  ‘many’ (countable nouns)
                 aipo6                ‘many’ (countable nouns)
                 motuke               ‘much, many’
                 telu                 ‘some’
                 mwamolemwamole ‘a few’ (lit. one-one)
                 mwa (see §5.3.1)     ‘none’
                 bofu ~ mofu          ‘another one’
    Mare and mareteku ‘all’, bofu ‘another one’ and telu ‘some’ can stand alone as
pronouns (see example (40)), as can numbers. Bofu can also precede a noun, and then
functions as a specifier – the speaker has a particular entity in mind.
      (34) Eete-geni fori uliolu sai.
            here-thing pig fat         many
            ‘This pig had a lot of fat.’
      (35) Meti mwa! Rori metie sai-sai                   feti a-la-ne.
            really no        fish really many-many very do-P.DUR-1/3P.R
            ‘Wow, there were lots of fish!’
      (36) Sumugi aipo le-lee.
            boil       lots do-3S.R
            ‘He’s got lots of boils.’

    Note that aipo may be related to the distributive suffix -po.

        (37) Penki       motuke nifa-te-ne.
             fruit.bat many       give.P-3P.O-1/3P.R
             ‘They gave them lots of bats.’
        (38) Saimon Andrew Banabas nariemu-ane mare la-me-ne.
             Simon Andrew Barnabas wife-PL                 all  stay-D.DUR-1/3P.R
             ‘Simon, Andrew, Barnabas and their wives were all there.’
        (39) Ri     tifilu mareteku-me kwoneblu le-lee.
             skin hair all-CER             white     do-3S.R
             ‘All its feathers are white.’
        (40) Mareteku arefe-teri-po-ne.
             all           fly-MOT.TOWARD-DISTR-1/3P.R
             ‘All of them (beetles) came flying.’
   Mare also combines with na ‘talk’ and feti ‘very’ to yield marena ‘truth’ and
marefeti ‘completely’. The latter can be split to surround the sentence constituent it is
modifying. In example (41), robo ‘close’ is a noun:
     (41) Mare robo robo feti a-fo-la-lee.
            all    close close very do-3S.O-P.DUR-3S.R
            ‘(She) went very close (to her).’2.3 Personal pronouns7
    There are two sets of free personal pronouns. The first set is the most frequently
used. Table 5 gives the person and number distinctions for set 1 pronouns:

    The section on personal pronouns was substantially reanalysed and rewritten in 2008 by the editors,
    building on Spencer’s original analysis.

     3               nanu ~ nalu ~ nane                        nanulu              nanule
    Number distinctions for first and second person subjects are apparently made on
the basis of non-plural (singular or dual) versus plural (more than two). This number
marking does not match plural marking everywhere else in the language, in which
‘plural’ signifies ‘two or more’. A similar category of ‘non-plural’ number marking
occurs with some nouns in the nearby language Imonda (Seiler 1985:38).
    The free personal pronouns are most commonly found as the subjects of clauses,
although they are not obligatory in this position. For example, (42) would be equally
grammatical if the pronoun were deleted:
      (42) Nanu ite        tu-lee.
            3.PN house build-3S.R
            ‘He built a house.’
    In (43) and (44) below, speakers judge the first member of each pair grammatical,
and the second unacceptable:
      (43) a. Mene fo-me-ie-ke                wa-fe
                1NPL eat-D.DUR-1S.R-SEQ go-1S.IR
                 ‘I’ll eat and then go’
             b. *Mena fo-me-ie-ke              wa-fe
                1PL         eat-D.DUR-1S.R-SEQ go-1S.IR
                 ‘I’ll eat and then go’
      (44) a. Mena fo-me-ne-ke                  wa-bile
                1PL       eat-D.DUR-1/3P.R-SEQ go-1/3P.IR
                 ‘We’ll eat and then go’
8
  [Editors’ note] The pronouns mene, mena, une and nane are phonemically /mənə/, /məna/, /unə/ and
  /nanə/. Schwa /ə/ is a marginal phoneme in Kwomtari, and is underrepresented in the orthography.
  Refer to discussion at §2.2 of paper by Drew (this volume).

  [Editors’ note] Nanu is the form used in Baifeni village, nalu in Yaur and Yanebi, and nane in
  Kwomtari, Mango and Wagreni.

                 b. *Mene fo-me-ne-ke            wa-bile
                    1NPL    eat-D.DUR-1/3P.R-SEQ go-1/3P.IR
                    ‘We’ll eat and then go’
     The unmarked meaning of mene is singular. Dual number may be indicated with
the addition of weife ‘dual’ following the pronoun, as in (45), or with weife alone, as
in (46):
      (45) Mene weife nuboue pe                wa-bile      mena-nu
            1NPL DU           good      POSB go-1/3P.IR 1.PN-NN
            aie-lu-fi-le?
            father.1/2-nn-loc-gl
            ‘Is it all right for us both to go to my father?’
      (46) Te weife wa-ne-ke                 wo-feta-te-ne.
            and DU         go-1/3P.R-SEQ DIR.AWAY-see-3P.O-1/3P.R
            ‘We both went and we saw them there.’
     It is also possible for mene to express a dual meaning on its own when the context
is clearly dual, as in (47):
       (47) Mene-ko            asulu    lufwa pai ne-ne-ke               pruele-ne.
               1NPL-FOC.INC sorcery man PRB think-1/3P.R-SEQ flee.P-1/3P.R
               ‘We really thought “It must be a sorcerer” and we fled.’ (The narrative
               context shows the speaker is speaking for himself and one other person.)
    For possessive and object pronouns, the stem mena is used regardless of number,
as in (48) and (49). (Note that the possessive and object forms of third person
pronouns are formed with the suffixes -lu and -le respectively, but for first and second
person pronouns the suffixes used are -nu and –ne10.
     (48) Mena-nu bebrie-fu ambue            eese le-lee.
            1.PN-NN past-ABL ancestor thus do-3S.R
            ‘My ancestor from before did like this.’
     (49) Tolsi mena-ne na-o-lee,…
            Tolsi 1.PN-GL say-1/2S.O-3S.R
            ‘Tolsi said to me…’
   The second person pronouns une and una generally behave like mene and mena.
Une is used for singular or dual subjects (examples (50) - (52)), and una for subjects10
     Refer to the discussion in §6.1.2 of paper by Drew (this volume).
68                                                              Kwomtari Grammar
more than two in number (example (53)). Possessive and object pronouns are formed
with una regardless of number (examples (54) and (55)). However, una may also be
used in emphatic contexts for a single number (see below):
      (50) Une temio fale-lu-ke.
           2NPL axe       get.S-2S.R-SEQ
           ‘You get an axe, and…’
      (51) Une weife nablue-la-bu!

           ‘Then I asked him, “Where’s the pig?” “There - it’s there on your side!”’

           3.PN 2.PN-GL child give.S-1/2S.O-3S.IR
           ‘She will give the child to you.’
     There are no number distinctions in third person pronouns, although the form of
the pronoun varies between villages (refer to table 5 above). Number distinctions may
be marked by verbal person/number suffixes, as in (56) and (57):
      (56) Nanu fori mena-fe tine-lee.
            3.PN pig 1PL-RSN give-3S.R
            ‘He gave a pig to us.’
      (57) Nanu wa-ne-i…
            3.PN go-1/3P.R-SIM
            ‘When they had gone…’11
     Elicited example.
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                  69
    The mismatches between subject and other syntactic roles in marking pronoun
number suggest the distinctions may be recent. This may be due to change in the
language as a result of contact with neighbouring languages and Tok Pisin, which
have a clear distinction between singular and plural pronouns.
    The pronouns une and mena can be joined to make une-mena ‘first person
inclusive plural’. This contrasts with mene weife ‘we two’, which may be inclusive or
exclusive of the hearer.
    The pronouns in the second set are less commonly used. No second person
pronoun has been recorded for this set. The pronouns found for set 2 are listed in
table 6:
                                          TABLE 6: SET 2 PRONOUNS                                   Independent        Possessive    Object

                         3         nali               nalilu        nalile
    Set 2 pronouns have stronger force than the set 1 pronouns, e.g. menanu ‘my’ vs.
nianu ‘my own’, nanulu ‘his/her/their’ vs. nalilu ‘his/her/their own’. Examples (58)
and (59) show that the set 2 pronoun nia can be considered more emphatic than the
corresponding set 1 pronoun mene:
      (58) Mene fori-le feta-ie.
            1NPL pig-GL see-1S.R
            ‘I saw the pig.’
      (59) Nia fori-le feta-ie.

     Examples (58) and (59) were elicited.

              3.PN-CER word tell-D.DUR-3S.R
              ‘He was telling himself a story.’
    The pronoun una, which is otherwise used for second person subjects more than
two in number, is also used for single number when the meaning is emphatic:
     (66) Una wofoli-ane-le               nifa-fwa-te-le.
           2.PN sister(of.M).1/2-PL-GL give.P-MOT.AWAY-3P.O-2S.IR
           ‘You will give (the things you kill) to your sisters.’132.4 Demonstratives
    Kwomtari has a marker of focus, te, which most often functions as a conjunction
(see §6.2 for further discussion). This focus marker is the basis for the two most
frequently used demonstratives, which are formed by prefixing ee- or u-. Te marks an
established deictic centre in discourse. With the prefixes ee- and u-, the deictic centre
is the speaker, and the demonstratives formed mark close proximity and distance
respectively.14
       Kwomtari has a three-term demonstrative system:
         a. eete    ‘here: close by’
         b. eke     ‘there: a bit further away, e.g. out of reach but still in sight’
         c. ute     ‘over there: further away (yonder)’13
      Free translation in Tok Pisin: Yu yet bai givim long ol susa.
14
       [Editors’ note] These forms provide further evidence for the hypothesis (Dixon 2003: 88-89) that
     ‘near’ demonstratives are more likely cross-linguistically to involve front high vowels.
Kwomtari Grammar                                                                                       71
     These demonstratives take the suffixes -geni ‘thing’ and -pane ‘things’. The
latter can only be used with people and animals/birds, but speakers say the use of it is
declining. Table 7 shows the demonstratives produced with these suffixes:
                                       TABLE 7: DEMONSTRATIVES
                             + -geni ‘thing’                       + -pane ‘things’
eete ‘here: close by’ eetegeni ‘this’                              eetepane ‘these’
eke ‘there’                  ekeni       ‘that (close)’            ekepane ‘those (close)’
ute ‘over there’             utegeni ‘that (further away)’ utepane ‘those (further away)’
       The following elicited examples show that the distinction is based on distance:15
        (67) Eete-geni-le pe fo-le?
               here-thing-GL INT eat-2S.IR
               ‘Do you want to eat this?’ (of an object in front of speaker; but
               unacceptable when the object is across the table from speaker)
        (68) Ekeni-le             pe fo-le?

               a third party, but unacceptable when third party moves to table close to
               speaker and addressee)
        (70) Bale akei           la-la-lee?           Eete la-la-lee.

               ‘It’s there.’ (at third party’s feet, close to speaker, further from addressee)15
     The elicited examples (67) - (72) and (78), with accompanying text, were added by the editors in 2008,
     but did not affect Spencer’s analysis.

      (74) ute            pori-te
            over.there side-FOC
            ‘that side’

demonstratives. Note the ungrammatical construction at (78d):

    Another word, mokene, references an entity that is much farther away. The mo- is
a bound form. It cannot be detached as a demonstrative word.

          d.    uteime ‘that way’ (over.there-LOC-CER), e.g. uteime wao ‘go that
                          way’ (with gesture).

    The demonstratives may also be used to refer anaphorically or cataphorically to
topics in a discourse.16 Eete and its compounds may be used to introduce a new
discourse (82) or a new topic within a discourse (83).","[69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"
"     The phoneme /ɭ/ occurs as either [ɭ], a voiced retroflex lateral, or [ɖ] a voiced
retroflex plosive, in free variation in all environments. There is a slight preference
for the lateral rather than the plosive following a consonant in a consonant cluster.
There is occasional phonological conditioning by the prenasalisation rule
explained in §3.3. Occasionally either phone may be produced in a manner that is
not apparently retroflexed, but this is not phonologically conditioned. Examples of
this free variation are given in (1):
       (1) /ɭi/             [ɭi] ~ [ɖi]                 ‘tongue’

occurring as the voiceless allophone [ɸ] word-initially and becoming voiced [β]
intervocalically. Examples are given in (2):

consonant cluster, with either /r/ or /ɭ/ as the second member. In these consonant
clusters, both consonants are members of the same syllable; refer to the discussion

    Kwomtari has eight vowel phonemes. The discussion of the vowels and
contrasts will proceed progressively, moving from the more usual to the less usual
contrasts. Five of the Kwomtari vowels correspond to the five basic vowels of
Papuan languages (Foley 1986:52). These five vowels are:
    /i/ occurs as a high front unrounded vowel;    /ɛ/ occurs as a lower-mid front unrounded vowel;    /u/ occurs as a high back rounded vowel;    /ɔ/ occurs as a lower-mid back rounded vowel;    The low central vowel /a/ occurs as two allophones, which are in free variation
in all environments. These allophones are [a], a fully open central unrounded
vowel, and [ɐ], a not quite fully open, central unrounded vowel (Pullum and
Ladasaw 1986:6). Both occur, but [ɐ] is more common. However, the phoneme is
spelled /a/ for ease of reading. Examples are given in (4):

some explanation. They are very close in tongue height to /i/ and /u/; they are also
higher than IPA cardinal vowels [e] and [o]. These vowels are not centralised as in
English /I/, /ʊ/. It is often very difficult to hear the difference between these
vowels and the higher counterparts. Villagers who have been taught reading and
writing in the five-vowel Tok Pisin system will sometimes write /i̞/ as <i> and
sometimes as <e>; they will also sometimes write /u̞/ as <u> and sometimes as

system of Tok Pisin does not match the Kwomtari vowel system.2

    [Editors’ note] Similar ‘lowered high’ vowels have been found in Weri (a Goilalan language of
    south-east Papua), and in a number of Dani dialects (Foley 1986:54).

    The phonemic status of /ə/ (schwa) is the most difficult to establish of the
vowel phonemes, but can be demonstrated through the phonotactic constraints of
the language. One reason for this difficulty is that the vowel /ɛ/ is often
pronounced [ə], apparently in any environment. An example is given in (7):
      (7)      /ɛkɛni/                [ɛkɛni] ~ [əkəni]      ‘that’
     Schwa never receives stress when other vowels are present in a word. The
sole instance of a stressed schwa is the word /mənə/ [mənə], in which the initial
schwa is stressed. Additionally, Kwomtari language advisors who have been
educated in the five-vowel system of Tok Pisin have a tendency to omit a symbol
for this sound when they are writing certain words. The following words are
written without schwa quite frequently (angle brackets enclose common
spellings):
      (8)      /məɭi/       [məɭi]        <mli>                   ‘water, river’
               /mənə/       [mənə]        <mne, mune>             ‘I’
               /ɸəta/       [ɸətɐ]        <fta>                   ‘see’
    It is sometimes difficult to hear the schwa between the consonants, but I am
convinced it is present. When these words are spoken slowly and deliberately, the
vowel is evident. This cannot be said concerning other consonant clusters in the
language, which are only permitted when the second is a liquid (see §3.3). As
further support of this analysis, note that these three words are the only ones

examples of /mɭ/, /mn/ and /ɸt/ would be expected if they were true clusters.","[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]"

"1.3 Linguistic description
1.3.1 Language name and dialects
     Speakers do not call their language Kwomtari; that name was given by the
pioneer surveyors Loving and Bass (1964) after the local airstrip. Speakers refer to
their language by their word for ‘why?’ Unfortunately, this is one of the few lexical
items with different variants in each of the six major villages. While in the central
village of Baifeni the language is called Glefe, in other villages it is variously called
Klefe, Kefe, or Kisofe. Since Loving and Bass also applied the name Kwomtari to a
putative language phylum, that name has become well-known by linguists, and it
seems best to retain it when describing the language for the outside world.
    It is generally agreed that there are three dialects. The western dialect is spoken in
Mango and Kwomtari villages, the central dialect in Baifeni and Yanebi, and the
eastern dialect in Wagreni and Yaur. The two western villages have the greatest
lexical differences from the other villages. For example, their word for banana is ri,
where the other villages say beni or meni. In most cases known of, where Kwomtari
and Mango have a lexical difference from the other villages, their term is similar to
the corresponding term in the Nai language. The dialect differences do not seem to
affect communication between villages.
12                                                                             Introduction1.3.2 Earlier work
    The first known mention of the Kwomtari language was in a survey by SIL
members Richard Loving and Jack Bass, conducted in January 1964 on behalf of the
Australian administration (Loving and Bass 1964). They identified most languages in
the Amanab sub-district, and proposed the ‘Kwomtari Phylum’ (now described as the
Kwomtari family), including Kwomtari, Biaka [=Nai], Fas and Baibai (refer
discussion below).
    Another study of the language area was conducted in 1970/71 by Donald
Laycock of the Australian National University as part of a project to comprehensively
survey languages of the Sepik region, compiled in Laycock (1973). Laycock took
wordlists in Mango, Yanebi and Wagreni, and attempted some preliminary
typological work. His survey is the basis of subsequent published descriptions and
analyses of Kwomtari, which include various references in Wurm, ed. (1975) and
Wurm (1982).
     In June 1983, SIL members Wietze Baron and Bob Brown conducted a survey of
the villages suspected of belonging to the ‘Kwomtari Phylum’ (Baron 1983b). This
survey evaluated the competing subgroupings of the Kwomtari Phylum proposed by
the two previous surveys, and also established the separate status of the Guriaso
language (refer discussion in following section). A further SIL survey of the
Kwomtari language alone was conducted in September and October 1989 by Lynn
Landweer, Tuula Toivanen and Bob Brown (Landweer and Toivanen 1989). Data
was gathered in Kwomtari, Baifeni, Yanebi and Wagreni villages. That survey
resulted in SIL members Murray and Carol Honsberger commencing language work
in the area from mid 1990, based in Baifeni village.
1.3.3 Linguistic classification
    The classification of Kwomtari is controversial. It is generally agreed that the
language cannot be assigned to the Trans New Guinea family or any of the other
major families (Wurm and McElhanon 1975:156; Ross 2005). Loving and Bass
(1964), on the basis of lexical similarity between 4% and 12% measured against 180-
word Swadesh wordlists, grouped Kwomtari, Nai (Biaka), Fas and Baibai together as
the ‘Kwomtari phylum’. Within this larger grouping, they distinguished two pairs of
languages showing greater similarity to each other; Kwomtari was paired with Nai,
and Fas with Baibai.
    Laycock (1973, 1975) reversed these subgroupings, pairing Kwomtari with Fas,
and Baibai with Nai. Since he did not state the basis for this reversal, it is difficult to
determine his reasons, although he stated his classifications were not ‘based on
Introduction                                                                                 13detailed lexicostatistic analysis or comparison’, but were ‘impressionistic… the
accumulated effects of…noting resemblances and differences as they emerged’
(1973:2). It is likely that his criterion was grammatical structure, since he concluded
that Kwomtari and Fas both lack verbal subject concordance; this conclusion is now
known to be incorrect (see below). Nevertheless, Laycock’s prominence has ensured
that his subgroupings of the languages have been until recently the basis of most
published classifications, e.g. in Ethnologue (Gordon 2005). Laycock also added to
the ‘Kwomtari phylum’ Pyu, a language on the PNG-Indonesian border.
    Baron (1983b) took 100-word lists in each of the languages to assess the validity
of these rival classifications, again using the criterion of lexical similarity. In the
process, he also established the separate status of Guriaso. Baron’s results support the
original subgrouping by Loving and Bass. He finds that Kwomtari and Nai are
closely related, and Guriaso somewhat more distantly related to both; there is also a
close relationship between Fas and Baibai, but not strong evidence of a relationship
between them and the Kwomtari-Nai-Guriaso grouping. Why Baron’s survey was not
published is unclear, but it has now at last been posted on the web.13 Any definitive
grouping of the Kwomtari languages must depend on the application of the historical-
comparative method; however, Baron’s greater methodological rigour and Laycock’s
lack of engagement with previous work mean that Baron’s classification must be
considered more reliable.
    A recent development is the suggestion by Ross (2005:30) of a relationship
between the Kwomtari family and the Arai (Left May) family, based on pronoun
similarities.
1.3.4 Typological overview
    The phonology of Kwomtari is fairly straightforward, although unusually rich in
vowel phonemes compared with most Papuan languages. There are eleven
consonants; Kwomtari is distinctive in maintaining a four-way contrast between
voiceless stops, voiced stops, fricatives and nasals. The language has eight vowels,
which is one of the larger vowel systems recorded for Papuan languages (Foley
1986:54), although its near neighbour Imonda has a ten-vowel system (Seiler
1985:16). The most interesting feature of Kwomtari phonology is the presence of the
‘lowered-high’ vowels. These vowels, which contrast phonemically with the cardinal
high vowels, are pronounced in a raised close-mid position, but are not centralised as

not significant.
    Kwomtari grammar shows many features typical of Papuan languages or of the
Sepik region. Core noun phrases take nominative-accusative agreement, and
constituent order is SOV. Subject and object are cross-referenced by verbal suffixes,
which contradicts statements made by Laycock (1973, 1975) and Wurm (1982:246).
Subjects lack case marking, while objects of transitive verbs take the same case
marking as recipients of ditransitive verbs. This case marking system is common in
the Sepik-Ramu region (Foley 2005:134), although Kwomtari lacks the distinction
between animate and inanimate objects found in other languages. Complex actions
are expressed by a generic verb preceded by an adjunct noun. Sentences are formed
from chains of medial clauses terminating in an independent clause.
    Other features of Kwomtari grammar are more distinctive. Kwomtari appears to
be the first attested example of a Papuan language with a quinary case system for
oblique nominals (cf Foley 1986:101): location, goal of movement, source of
movement, instrument and cause all have distinct postpositions. Kwomtari lacks
gender or other classifiers, despite being surrounded by languages with one or more
noun classification systems. Medial verbs lack switch-reference marking, while
independent verbs are inflected for status (mood) and aspect, but not tense. Pronouns
are only distinguished for number with first and second person subjects; in other
syntactic roles and in third person, number distinctions are neutralised. Marking of
pragmatic focus is central to the grammatical system.
1.3.5 The papers
    The following papers on the phonology and grammar of Kwomtari are revised
versions of papers (Drew 1998; Spencer 1998) written by two English women, Julia
Drew and Katharine Spencer, who were recent university graduates. They were
assigned in 1998 to assist an SIL language programme under SIL’s Graduate
International Programme (GRIP). The authors conducted fieldwork while living with
Murray and Carol Honsberger in Baifeni village for 9 weeks, and subsequently wrote
up their findings at the SIL centre at Ukarumpa in the Eastern Highlands. While the
papers are still preliminary work in many ways, their conclusions have been validated
by application in the field, and SIL considers they should be made available to the
wider linguistic world as analysis of a previously undescribed language.
    The papers have been edited by permission of the authors, who are no longer
active in Papua New Guinea. In editing the papers, we have attempted to keep a
balance between preserving the integrity of the original documents, and updating
Introduction                                                                        15them in the light of ten years’ additional experience of work in the language. Further
examples have been inserted to illustrate points made by the authors, and the text has
been reworded to improve the presentation. In addition, references in the text to other
sources have been updated to the latest edition known, and further cross-references
have been added where it has seemed appropriate. However, no changes have been
made in the analysis unless a major point relevant to the discussion was not covered
in the original paper or where subsequent evidence showed the original analysis
needed to be refined. Where a change in the analysis has been made, it has been
footnoted.","[21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

Kwomtari Phonology                                                                                 476.2.2 Vowel harmony
    Stem-final /ɛ/ on verbs is frequently rounded and backed when a syllable
ending in /u/ is suffixed. This rule is optional; my language advisors inform me
that the vowel may remain unchanged and still be well-formed. However, my
impression is that this rule is usually applied. The rule is illustrated in (18) - (20)
below; all the examples are well-formed:
         (18)     /puɛɭu/ ~ /puɔɭu/              ‘you dug’
         (19)     /jəunɛtɛɭu/ ~ /jəunɛtɔɭu/ ‘you laughed at them’
         (20)     /tuɛɭu/ ~ /tuɔɭu/              ‘you cooked’
   Example (21) demonstrates that the alternate forms in (20) are the result of
vowel harmony:
         (21)     /tuɛɭi̞ / ~ */tuɔɭi̞ /         ‘he/she cooked’
    Vowel harmony is a morphophonemic rule occurring with verb suffixes, not a
phonological rule throughout the language. The following words, all found in the
language, do not show vowel harmony:2
         (22)     a.    /aiɛbu/                  ‘crayfish’
                  b.    /bɛsuka/                 ‘rafter’
                  c.    /iɭɛkuɭi/                ‘fire pit’
                  d.    /kaɭiɛɸu/                ‘bird’
                  e.    /ɛsuɭu/                  ‘immediately’
                  f.    /prijɛmu/                ‘string’6.2.3 Vowel raising
       When the low-mid back vowel /-ɔ/ is the final vowel in a verbal suffix, it is
raised to the lowered high vowel /-u̞/ if it immediately precedes any of a specific
set of verbal suffixes. At first, it seemed as though these changes were based2
    [Editors’ note] it appears that the morphophonemic rule is in the process of generalising, becoming
    a phonological rule. Some speakers have been heard to say [bɔsukɐ] for besuka, [iɭɔkuɭi] for
    ilekuli, and [prijɔmu] for priemu. However, this tendency is less marked than the morphophonemic
    rule noted above.

purely on the height of the following vowel, but it has since become apparent that
these changes are the result of a select number of specific suffixes, and this cannot
be accounted for phonologically. Table 5 shows the suffixes which are affected.
                TABLE 5: SUFFIXES AFFECTED BY VOWEL RAISING RULE3
                      Affected suffix                         Conditioning suffix

                         -po distributive                       -mai ‘on top of’4    As a result, the first singular object suffix /-ɔ/ becomes /u̞/ when -ne (first and
third plural realis subject marker) or -la (proximal durative aspect marker) are
suffixed directly after it. Example (23) shows the form of the morpheme /-ɔ/ when
not occurring with /-ne/ or /-la/. The verbal stem /na/ ‘say’ has been used:
       (23)     a.    /binaɔ/                   ‘tell me first’
                b.    /naɔɭu/                   ‘you told me’
    The examples in (24) show the same morpheme when affected by the presence
of -ne and -la:
       (24)     a.    /nau̞nɛ/                  ‘they told me’
                b.    /nau̞ɭanɛ/                ‘they are talking to me’     Example (25) shows the same process with the verb /ɸəta/ ‘see’:
       (25)     a.    /ɸətaɔɭi̞ /               ‘he saw me’
                b.    /ɸətau̞ɭaɭi̞ /            ‘he sees me’

  [Editors’ note] Fuller descriptions of the glosses may be found in §6.2 of Spencer, this volume.
  Note that not all the possible combinations in table 5 can actually occur, because of the verbal slots
  occupied by different suffixes. For instance, -fwa occurs in the +2 slot occupied by motion
  suffixes. Only the distributive marker -po may occur in the preceding +1 slot. As a result, only -po
  can be conditioned by a following -fwa.

  The suffix -mai is a nominal suffix, not a verbal one. See discussion below.
Kwomtari Phonology                                                                   49
     This morphophonemic rule must be applied before the phonological semi-
vowel insertion rule (§4.3). If the phonological rule had been applied first, [w]
would have been inserted between the back vowel /ɔ/ and the neighbouring vowel
/a/; after application of the vowel raising rule, the phonetic form would have been
*[nɐwu̞nɛ] (see sample derivation (26b) below). In fact, the morphophonemic rule
is applied first. Since /ɔ/ becomes [u̞] in this environment, and /ɐu̞/ is an acceptable
diphthong, no further changes are required to be made in sample derivation (26a).
But when /ɔ/ remains unchanged, as in sample derivation (26c), /a/ and /ɔ/ belong
to different syllables, and [w] must be inserted.
    Sample derivations:
      (26) a.     UR                           /naɔnɛ/       ‘they told me’
                  Vowel raising rule:          [nɐu̞nɛ]
                  Semivowel insertion rule:    N.A.
                  SR:                          [nɐu̞nɛ]
            b.    UR                           /naɔnɛ/       ‘they told me’
                  Semivowel insertion rule:    [nawɔnɛ]
                  Vowel raising rule:          [nɐwu̞nɛ]
                  SR:                          *[nɐwu̞nɛ]
            c.    UR                           /naɔɭi̞ /     ‘s/he told me’
                  Vowel raising rule:          N.A.
                  Semivowel insertion rule:    [nɐwɔɭi̞ ]
                  SR:                          [nɐwɔɭi̞ ]   The third person singular object suffix /ɸɔ/ undergoes the same
morphophonemic alterations as -o before /-ne/ and /-la/. The examples in (27)
show the form of the suffix when not affected by this morphophonemic rule:
     (27)    a.    /naɸɔɭi̞ /            ‘he told him’
             b.    /naɸɔɭu/              ‘you told him’
             c.    /ɭɛɸɔɭɛ/              ‘you will do to him’
    Example (28) gives the application of this rule:
50                                                                          Kwomtari Phonology         (28)    a.    /ɭɛɸu̞nɛ/                 ‘they did to him’
                 b.    /naɸu̞ɭanɛ/               ‘they are telling him’
                 c.    /uririnaɸu̞ɭaɭi̞ /        ‘he is choosing it’   The rule also applies to /-mɔ/, the first and second person plural object suffix.5
Example (29) illustrates the unmodified form of the suffix:
         (29)    /namɔɭi̞ kɛ/                    ‘he told us, and then…’
       Example (30) shows the vowel raising rule applied:
         (30)    /namu̞ɭaiɛ/                     ‘I am telling you this’    The same morphophonemic rule affects the distributive suffix /-pɔ/. This
suffix also undergoes change when preceding /-ne/ and /-la/, but because of this
morpheme’s different position in the verb the same change occurs in association
with the suffix of motion /-ɸwa/. Example (31) shows the occurrence of this
morpheme when not affected by the vowel raising rule:
         (31)    a.    /tɛripɔ/                  ‘bring lots!’
                 b.    /aru̞pɔtu/                ‘with plenty of rain’
                 c.    /susunapɔtɛnɛi/           ‘when their (hands) are tired’
       The examples in (32) show the application of the vowel raising rule:
         (32)    a.    /tɛriɛpu̞nɛ/              ‘we/they brought plenty’
                 b.    /napu̞ɸuanɛ/              ‘they talked a lot while doing’
     The distributive marker can also be suffixed to nouns. In this position, it may
undergo vowel raising when followed by the suffix -mai ‘on top of’. This is
illustrated in (33):
         (33)    a.    /iɛbɔɛpɔ/                 ‘plenty of mats’
                 b.    /iɛbɔɛpu̞mai/             ‘on plenty of mats’
5
    [Editors’ note] Presumably the same rule is capable of affecting -mo, the second person realis
    subject suffix, which is identical in form. However, because of the ordering of verb suffixes, none
    of the conditioning suffixes can occur after that suffix.

preference of speakers.
    The semivowels [j] and [w] should be written as <y> and <w> respectively in
some instances, even though they have not been firmly established as phonemes.

written as <w> when it occurs as labialisation following another consonant, e.g. in
fwi.

Kwomtari Grammar Essentials
       by Katharine Spencer
                        1. Introduction    Kwomtari is a Papuan language, spoken by people in six villages in the Sandaun
Province of Papua New Guinea, close to the border of Indonesia. These six villages
are divided into three dialect groups, with higher than 94% lexical similarity between
dialects. This paper is based on data collected from the dialect of Baifeni village. The
people of Baifeni call their language ‘Glefe’, from the word for ‘why’.
    The corpus of data used in this analysis was collected mainly by Murray and
Carol Honsberger, between 1989 and 1998. In 1998, I and my colleague Julia Drew
were privileged to live and work with them among the people of Baifeni for nine
weeks, from early February to mid April. Working with the Summer Institute of
Linguistics under their ‘Graduate International Programme’ (GRIP), most of this time
was spent collecting more language data, Julia concentrating more on phonological
data and I on the grammar. Tomas Didiki and Yesefe Sukwari have been the principal
language advisors since 1989, but we were also advised by Dikson Gumute, Robert
Kosme and Lukas Dimeni (as well as numerous other villagers) during our nine-week
stay.
    The data consists mainly of texts written by Kwomtari speakers during two
‘writers’ workshops’ – the first run by Frans Zandstra at Amanab and the second in
Baifeni village by Murray Honsberger, with men from each of the villages. Other
texts were collected on cassettes and transcribed by Murray. Only a few texts from
dialects other than Baifeni have been worked on, and then only after they were
adapted to Baifeni dialect. Also included is data elicited from language helpers. Texts
are presented in this paper using the practical orthography recommended in the
accompanying phonology paper by Julia Drew; additionally, the underlying
morphemes are shown, not the surface forms after the application of any
morphophonemic changes.
    Kwomtari is an SOV language, while the order of suffixation on the verb is VOS.
There is no switch-reference system – participants in discourse are tracked by subject
marking on each clause. Kwomtari uses postpositions; the normal order in the noun
phrase is demonstrative, noun, adjective. Kwomtari has many two-phoneme particles,                                          54

is the base for demonstratives and conjunctions.
     Thanks are due to Murray and Carol Honsberger and their children who
welcomed me warmly into their language programme; also to the people of Baifeni
village, especially the men mentioned above who gave much time to help me grasp
the grammar of their language. Thanks are also due to all those in England who have
supported me and enabled me to spend this time in Papua New Guinea, and to John
Roberts and others who were involved in the training for GRIP. Also to Julia and my
other friends here who have been a great encouragement. Special thanks are due to
Cindi Farr who has worked hard to help me analyse the more complicated parts of
this grammar and has suggested improvements to the paper.
            2. Nouns and noun phrases    This chapter discusses elements of the noun phrase. The first section (§2.1)
includes a description of types of nouns (§2.1.1), the special category of kinship
nouns (§2.1.2), adjectives – which are difficult to differentiate from nouns (§2.1.3),
compound nouns (§2.1.4) and nouns derived from other verbal categories (§2.1.5).
The following sections discuss quantifiers (§2.2), pronouns (§2.3), demonstratives
(§2.4), and finally the structure of the noun phrase (§2.5).","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"
"4.2 Prenasalisation
    When a voiced plosive occurs in a syllable preceded by a syllable beginning
with a nasal, the voiced plosive becomes prenasalised with a homorganic nasal.
Examples appear in (7) below:
          (7)    /kuɔnɛbɭu/       [kʷɔ.nɛ. ͫbɭu]          ‘white’
                 /muaɡiɸɛ/        [mʷɐ. ɡi.βɛ]
                                          ŋ
                                                          ‘three’
                 /naɡɭi/          [nɐ. ɡɭi]
                                      ŋ
                                                          ‘vein’
                 /nəbɔə/          [nə. ͫbɔ.wə]            ‘good’
    The velar nasal is only found in Kwomtari as a result of the prenasalisation
process. The only apparent exception, shown in (8), is the word for ‘try’: /aɡɛ/
[ɐŋɡɛ].
          (8)    /aɡɛ/            [ɐ.ŋɡɛ]                 ‘try’
    In (8) there is no apparent nasal to cause prenasalisation, but a single example
of [ŋ] is not sufficient to justify treating it as a phoneme in its own right. Rather, it
seems to fit into a pattern of other words beginning with /a/ showing
prenasalisation of their voiced plosives without a preceding nasal:
Kwomtari Phonology                                                                 39          (9)   /abɔ/            [ɐ. ͫbɔ]                ‘jungle’
                /abɔu/           [ɐ. ͫbɔu]               ‘turtle’
                /abu̞/           [ɐ. ͫbu̞]               ‘penis’
                /abuɛ/           [ɐ. ͫbu.wɛ]             ‘grandkin’
                /abɛi/           [ɐ. ͫbɛi]               ‘below’
                /aɡɛ/            [ɐ.ŋɡɛ]                 ‘try’
     It is difficult to prove whether the first five examples are examples of
prenasalisation or just words where the first syllable ends in a nasal and the second
syllable begins with a homorganic voiced plosive, but it seems significant that all
these words begin with the same phoneme. The initial /a/, like all Kwomtari
vowels, shows no sign of nasalisation, so if these words do show prenasalisation,
as the last example would suggest, the most likely explanation would be that there
is a diachronic reason to account for this phenomenon. The word for ‘grandkin’ is
entered twice in our lexicon – once as ambue (1st and 2nd person reference) and
once as nambue (3rd person reference).
     The prenasalisation rule also affects speakers’ pronunciation of the allophones
[ɭ] and [ɖ], which are in free variation with each other. One of the verbs for ‘to do’
is ne. When the proximal durative aspect suffix -la is added, if the first sound of
this suffix is [ɭ], there is no change. However, if the first sound of this suffix is
pronounced [ɖ], a homorganic nasal is inserted before the voiced stop, in
accordance with the prenasalisation rule. Hence, the following examples are both
well-formed:
          (10) /nɛɭaɭi/          [nɛ.ɭɐ.ɭi] ~ [nɛ.ⁿɖɐ.ɭi] ‘he is doing’
    but this example is ill-formed:
          (11) /nɛɭaɭi/        *[nɛ.ɖɐ.ɭi]               ‘he is doing’
    Kwomtari speakers’ pronunciation of Tok Pisin seems to be influenced by this
prenasalisation, for example nogut ‘bad’ is sometimes pronounced [nɔŋɡut].","[48, 49]"

    A tail constituent (Dik 1991:19) is external to the clause and positioned at the
sentence terminus. It is distinguished from the main clause by a slight pause which
follows the verb. Tail constituents are illustrated in (9) and (10):
       (9) Fori afue-ie,        nia.
            pig carry-1S.R 1.PN
            ‘I carried the pig - I did.’
      (10) Ri-ne,           wokoo-i-le.
            come-1/3P.R village-LOC-GL
            ‘We came, to the village.’
    In the following example, the goal noun phrases nianu inali Yentile ‘my wife
Yenti’ and tabe ramulule ‘the sago pulp’ each follow the verb they are associated
with. This has the effect of adding focus to the information placed in the tail
constituent:
      (11) Na-fo-ie,           nia-nu   inali Yenti-le, “Fori te-le
             say-3S.O-1S.R 1.PN-NN wife Yenti-GL pig               FOC-GL
             fo-la-lee,         tabe ramulu-le.”
             eat-P.DUR-3S.R sago meat-GL
             ‘I said to her - my wife Yenti - “The pig’s eating it, the sago pulp!”’8.2 Coordinate sentences
    Coordinate sentences consist of independent bases that are juxtaposed, or joined
with o ‘or’ or mwa ‘no’.

   Kwomtari has no coordinator like the English ‘and’. Coordinate sentences
encoding conjunction are simply juxtaposed (12), or linked by te ‘FOC’ (13):
     (12) Nuboue la-la-bile,                glei rife a-bile.
           good      remain-P.DUR-1/3P.IR NEG sick do-1/3P.IR
           ‘We will stay well, we won’t get sick.’

                FOC some inside very remain-P.DUR-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R
                ‘Close to this (part of the tree) that’s dry, some (grubs) remain, and some
                remain truly inside (in the middle).’
8.2.2 Disjunction
   The conjunction o (probably from Tok Pisin o ‘or’) is gaining increasing usage as
a means for encoding disjunction (14).

                his body will be very thin, or he will die due to this sickness.’2
8.2.3 Adversative
       Mwa ‘no’ sometimes indicates an adversative relationship like ‘but’.","[163, 164, 165]"

Kwomtari Phonology Essentials
          by Julia Drew
                      1. Introduction    This paper examines and describes the sound system and phonological
processes apparent in the Kwomtari language. It is not intended to be exhaustive,
and alterations may be made as more data is uncovered.
     The corpus of data used in this analysis was collected mainly by Murray and
Carol Honsberger, between 1990 and 1997. This paper is based on data collected
from the Baifeni dialect. In 1998, I was privileged to live and work among the
people of Baifeni for nine weeks, from early February to mid April. Working
under the GRIP (UK) programme, this time was spent collecting more language
data for working towards both the Grammar Essentials and the Phonology
Essentials of the language with my colleague, Katharine Spencer. I also spent time
refining the aforementioned corpus of data which had been entered into the
FindPhone programme from the lexicon (of over 800 entries), by compiling word
lists to compare and contrast certain phones. Tomas Didiki and Yesefe Sukwari
have been the principal language helpers since 1989, but I also received help from
Robert Kosme, Diksen Gumute and Lukas Dimeni (as well as numerous other
villagers with less experience of language work) during my nine week stay.
     Major areas of interest in Kwomtari Phonology include labialisation, and the
interrelationship between [ɖ] and [ɭ], which have caused some controversy among
the Kwomtari people. The analysis of semivowels is also problematic. The Baifeni
dialect was specifically chosen for analysis work because it is spoken in the most
central village in the Kwomtari language area, where it is expected to have
undergone minimal influence from other surrounding language groups. However,
this dialect is clearly not immune from influence from the surrounding dialects,
which show enough difference to cause confusion in the phonology. This
influence is mainly due to intermarriage between villages, and I would expect the
language to change towards only one phonological system in the future.
    This paper first sets out the phonemes of the language, together with the
evidence for their existence (§2). Sections 3, 4 and 5 successively look at
phonotactic constraints in Kwomtari, resulting phonological rules and
                                       18

language, and the final section briefly makes recommendations for the
orthography.
    Transcription conventions      are    in   accordance    with    IPA    (1993)
recommendations.
Acknowledgements
    I would like to express my appreciation to the following people for their
contribution to this paper.
    Special thanks go to Tomas Didiki and Diksen Gumute for their hours of
dedicated work in producing Kwomtari words more times than they enjoyed in
order to help me build up a good corpus of data to work from. Thank you for your
patience!
    Thanks also go to Katharine Spencer for all her support and help as we
explored the Kwomtari language together. My work on the Phonology Essentials
and her work on the Grammar Essentials was often interrelated.
    I would like to thank Eileen Gasaway for all her help as my consultant, and
for her helpful seminar notes.
    Thank you, Murray and Carol Honsberger for your commitment to the
Kwomtari people – for all the work you have already accomplished and for all that
will follow this paper. I am especially grateful to you, Carol, for your wisdom and
your encouragement to persevere through the difficult times in the village. This
paper is a small contribution to your work, and I owe its completion to you and to
God for using me in my weakness.
           2. Phonemic inventory    The phonemes of Kwomtari are set out in this section. Charts showing all of
the phonemes, and listings of the minimal and subminimal pairs are found in the
following subsections: consonants in §2.1 and vowels in §2.2. The semivowels
phonetically recorded in the language will be dealt with in §4.3.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

           ‘Simon, Andrew and Barnabas’s wife were there.’
    Other nouns are not obligatorily marked for plural. Some manifest initial CV
reduplication to signal plural reference, as in example (4):
       (4) Fori si-silu         afwi-i     a-la-ne.
            pig RED-baby trail-LOC do-P.DUR-1/3P.R
            ‘Baby pigs were on the trail.’
    Other nouns reduplicate completely to indicate a distributive meaning: ‘each’
and/or ‘every’:
       (5) Te inali         inali  feta-te-lu(-i)       te    bule    ragoolu-fi

            ‘When you see each of the women they’ll be carrying baskets full to the
            brim.’
     Nouns referencing animate beings can be distinguished from other nouns in a few
ways. Firstly, when an animate noun occurs as the head of a noun phrase, its
modifiers normally precede it (see §2.1.3), whereas for most other nouns the
modifiers follow the head noun. Secondly, the accompanier verbal prefix, -ife, can
only signal animate accompaniers (see §4.2.3), similarly the postposition -tu used as
comitative (see §3.2.2) only marks animate nouns. Thirdly, the verb stem la ‘remain’
alters to lai when the subject is both plural and inanimate. When the subject is either
singular or animate, the stem remains as la (see §4.1.5).
2.1.2 Kinship nouns
     Kinship nouns also differ from other nouns in that they are obligatorily possessed.
If the possessor is first or second person, the form in the second column of table 1 is

used. Third person forms in the third column indicate third person possessor. This list

2.1.3 Adjectives
    Identifying a class of adjectives distinct from nouns is problematic. There are
some differences, however. Semantically, nouns are defined by a cluster of
properties. Adjectives have basically one property. They indicate a quality, whereas
quantifiers are a distinct class (discussed in §2.2). As in examples (14) and (15),
specifying nouns always precede the nouns they modify. Adjectives, however, are
found before and after nouns. They generally precede nouns that reference animate
entities and follow all other nouns that they modify; compare (6) to (7), and (8) to (9):
        (6) tukilu auteli
             small girl
             ‘little girl’2
    [Editors’ note] Cousins are treated as siblings, as in many Papuan languages.

    With a few exceptions, adjectives are suffixed with -lu4 when in attributive
position. (However, -lu may be deleted when the adjective is in predicate position –
see §7.1.3.) This derivational suffix forms adjectival entities from nouns. The
‘adjectives’ given in table 2 may all be nouns underlyingly, amended by the -lu
suffix. For example, merekeilu ‘good’ comes from merekei which refers to the good
things given to a sorcerer so that he will perform sorcery on one’s behalf.","[66, 67, 68, 69]"

happen. Like pe and pai, it expresses epistemic modality, expressing a lack of doubt
on the part of the speaker.

    Tetie occurs at the end of stories to indicate that the speaker has finished. Here, its
meaning is something like ‘that’s all’. Being formed from the focus marker te, tetie
refers to previously mentioned material.

    Tetie often occurs with mai ‘on top’ meaning ‘that’s absolutely all’, as in (53) and
(54):

    Both demonstratives may be used to distinguish between competing topics, as in

eetegeni is used to re-introduce an entity previously mentioned on an earlier occasion
and so less accessible.

    The only obligatory part of the noun phrase is the head noun. The order around
the head noun is as follows. The demonstrative precedes the head unless there is a
possessor. If there is a possessor, the demonstrative immediately follows the head.
Adjectives have been discussed in §2.1.3 – they are usually positioned before the
noun for animate nouns (and also na ‘word’ and ami ‘way’), and after the noun for all
others. Noun phrases are almost always seen with a final -lu marking.
    Default order in the noun phrase:
       (Demonstrative)      HEAD (Qualifier) (Quantifier)
    When there is a possessor the order changes:
      (Possessor) HEAD (Demonstrative)           (Qualifier) (Quantifier)
    Default order in the noun phrase for animate nouns:
       (Demonstrative)      (Qualifier) HEAD (Quantifier)
2.5.1 Coordinating noun phrases
    The only conjoiner is the comitative postposition -tu (see §3.2.2), otherwise noun
phrases are simply juxtaposed in a list. The suffix -pe (discussed in §3.1.6) is used
within noun phrases to create a disjoint relationship, and mwa ‘no’ is used to deny the
presence of a noun within a noun phrase.

2.5.2 Appositional noun phrases
    An appositional noun phrase contains two noun phrases referring to the same
referent.

            ‘Simon, Andrew, Barnabas and their wives (all of them) were there.’
2.5.3 Intensifier phrase
    The intensifying particle feti forms intensifier phrases with nouns, noun phrases
or postpositional phrases. The intensifier phrase consists of the modified phrase,
followed by feti.

               3. Postpositions and
              postpositional phrases    Postpositions and postpositional clitics are difficult to distinguish and will
therefore be treated together. Both attach to noun phrases or other postpositional
phrases. They indicate the relationship to the predicate of the noun phrase they index.
Functionally, they can be divided into three sets:
        1. those that express the modal outlook the speaker has in regard to
            the marked noun,
        2. those that relate one noun to another, and
        3. those that relate a noun to the clausal predicate (usually a verb).
    The discussion of postpositions will cover these three sets in order (§3.1, §3.2,
§3.3), and will be followed by a description of postpositional phrases (§3.4). One
postposition, -tu ‘COM’ has a dual function and belongs to both set 2 and set 3; it is
therefore discussed in both §3.2 and §3.3.","[83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]"
"3.2 Consonant clusters
   Kwomtari consonant clusters are made up of just two consonants; the first is
always an obstruent and the second a liquid (/r/ or /ɭ/). Note also that with [ɭ] and
[ɖ] being in free variation, [ɖ] can be heard as the second consonant of a
consonant cluster on occasion, although [ɭ] seems to be preferred. Example (10)
summarises consonant clusters found in Kwomtari:

   See also the discussion of schwa in §2.2.
      4. Phonological processes4.1 Labialisation
   Where /u/ and /u̞/ follow consonants and precede another vowel, they are
commonly desyllabified and realised as labialisation of the preceding consonant.
Examples of labialisation are shown in (1) below.
         (1)   /takuɔni/       [tɐ.kʷɔ.ni]          ‘floor’
               /kuɔru/         [kʷɔ.ru]             ‘bow’
               /makuɔi/        [mɐ.kʷɔi]            ‘type of arrow’
               /ɡuaiɛ/         [ɡʷɐi.jɛ]            ‘cassowary’
               /nabui/         [nɐ. ͫbʷi]           ‘blazing’
               /buaɭi/         [bʷɐ.ɭi]             ‘shell ring money’
               /ɸui/           [ɸʷi]                ‘coconut’
               /tiaɸui/        [ti.jɐ.βʷi]          ‘snake’ (generic term)
               /muamɔɭɛ/       [mʷɐ.mɔ.ɭɛ]          ‘one’
    In Kwomtari, the most commonly labialised consonants are velar; bilabial
consonants also show examples of labialisation but are less frequently
encountered. This is in accordance with the universal trend for labialisation to
occur most commonly with velars, and somewhat less frequently with bilabials
(Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996:356). There are no examples of labialised
coronal consonants. The examples in (2) below show that coronal consonants are
not subject to labialisation:
                                          36
Kwomtari Phonology                                                              37         (2)    /tuɔɭu/         [tu.wɔ.ɭu]             ‘egg’
                /prɔnuɛ/        [prɔ.nu.wɛ]            ‘insert’
                /kuasuɛ/        [kʷɐ.su.wɛ]            ‘bamboo arrow’
                /ɭuɛ/           [ɭu.wɛ]                ‘sleep’
                /tui/           [tu.wi]                ‘prostitute’
                /aruɛ/          [ɐ.ru.wɛ]              ‘carry’    Labialisation also seems to be blocked preceding /ɛ/, as in example (3). It is
unclear why this is the case.
         (3)    /abuɛ/          [ɐ. ͫbu.wɛ]            ‘grandkin’
                /puɛ/           [pu.wɛ]                ‘dig’
    There are two apparent exceptions, shown in (4):
         (4)    /bubua/         [bu.bu.wɐ]             ‘beat’
                /ɭəbuɛmu/ (?)   [ɭə.bu.wə.mu]          ‘bone-tipped arrow’    In the second example, the phonetic schwa following [u] may be /ɛ/
underlyingly, since /ɛ/ can be reduced to [ə] in any environment. This would
explain why /b/ is not labialised. There are other examples where schwa follows a
labialised consonant, as in (5) below. These examples support the analysis that
schwa is a phoneme in its own right, and not just an allophone of /ɛ/ (refer to
§2.2):
         (5)    /mɔtukuə/       [mɔ.tu.kʷə]            ‘many’
                /tɐtukuə/       [tɐ.tu.kʷə]            ‘finish’
                /rukuə/         [ru.kʷə]               ‘shovel’
   When our language advisors write words with labialised consonants, they
sometimes write <w>, sometimes <u>, sometimes <o> and sometimes the
labialisation is unmarked. I am not surprised that both <w> and <u> are used; I
suggest that <o> is written when labialisation is caused by /u̞/, rather than /u/.
Labialisation is also often written as <o> before a low vowel, which may suggest
that the position of the lips is more open before low vowels than high vowels. I am
not sure why labialisation sometimes is unwritten, but it is notable that
38                                                                  Kwomtari Phonologylabialisation is always written in words where there is an unlabialised minimal pair
counterpart, as in the case of bali ‘garden’ and bwali ‘shell ring money’.
    Labialisation occurs before syllabification. When a non-coronal consonant is
followed by /u/ and then another high vowel (thus a vowel of the same height as
the underlying /u/), labialisation occurs first, and then syllabification. This ensures
that the two vowels remain part of the same syllable despite being the same
height. For example:
          (6)    /mui/            [mʷi]                   ‘salt’
                 /ɸui/            [ɸʷi]                   ‘coconut’
   Both these words are monosyllabic. The same is also true of all words in
which [w] is clearly derived from labialisation of [u] in a component morpheme,
even those where the vowel following the /w/ is considerably lower. This supports
the analysis that /u/ becomes a semi-vowel – taking on consonantal characteristics
– in this environment. Semi-vowels will be discussed in more detail in §4.3.","[44, 45, 46, 47, 48]"
"6.1 Particles
    Kwomtari has a number of words or particles, each of which has a unique
function and distribution. These cannot be easily placed in a class along with other
words, so they are described here in their own right. Some of these particles (feti,
kame, preme, keme) are noun-like, but cannot function as the head of a noun phrase
so they cannot be nouns.
6.1.1 te- ‘focus’
    Te is Kwomtari’s most important particle. It is a focus marker with three
functions.1
     The most common use of te is as a conjunction in discourse (see §6.2 for further
discussion). It functions like a recapitulatory constituent, linking the previous material
to the new. Te is the base for forming other conjunctions like tefe (FOC-RSN) ‘so’, tetu
(FOC-COM) ‘then’.

    [Editors’ note] Refer to footnote in §3.1.2.",[148]
"    Efficient cause-effect is often indicated by suffixing the clause indicating cause
with -ke and juxtaposing it with a following clause indicating effect. An example
appears in (29):
     (29) Nanu le-o-lee-ke                mene yefera-le-ie.
            3.PN do-1/2S.O-3S.R-SEQ 1NPL fall.S-do-1S.R
            ‘He made me fall.’ (Lit. ‘He did to me, and I fell.’)
8.4.2 Complex sentences encoding logical relations
    Logical relationships between clauses are expressed by the conjunctions based on
te ‘FOC’. These conjunctions are used between clauses regardless of whether they
share subjects, and whether they are dependent or independent.
    The conjunction tetu ‘then’ (FOC-COM) indicates that the first clause acts as a
stimulus for the second. Its meaning is similar to ‘and with that, …’.

            ‘If she (the mother) has rubbed mud on their shells and if the babies
            inside their shells are cheeping, then put them…’
    The conjunction tete ‘therefore’ (FOC-FOC) indicates that the event in the first
clause necessitates the occurrence of the event in the second clause. It conjoins
clauses in a sufficient cause-effect relationship.

             ‘You must not say the names of ‘thorn’ or ‘bamboo’ - then you wouldn’t
             get any bats.’
     The conjunction tefe ‘so’ (FOC-RSN) indicates that the first clause enables the
second clause to occur. It conjoins clauses in a reason-result relationship. This differs
from the cause-effect relationship above in that human volition is involved; the event
in the first clause does not necessitate the event in the second.

                  indices9.1 Indicative
     Any sentence structure with a final verb having realis status can realise
statements in the indicative mood:

    Imperative sentences have the same structure as other sentences. The only
difference occurs in the suffixation on the final verb. For singular imperatives, there
is no subject/status marker, while for plural imperatives the marker is -bu.1

"2.1 Nouns
    A noun functions syntactically as the head of a noun phrase. As head of noun
phrases that function as subjects or objects, a noun is cross-referenced on the verb for
person and number. Semantically, nouns realise people, places, things, ideas. Nouns
are further distinguishable from other classes in that only they can be modified by the
intensifier feti ‘very/truly’1.
2.1.1 Types of nouns
       Nouns can be subdivided into:
          1. kinship nouns
          2. nouns referencing animate beings
          3. adjectives
          4. all other nouns
    Kinship nouns are distinguished from other types of nouns by the fact that when
they refer to plural referents, they obligatorily take the plural suffix -ane (see
examples (1) and (2)). A comparison of examples (2) and (3) shows that only kinship
nouns with plural referents take the suffix; kinship nouns do not take the suffix when
they identify a single person within a plural subject.",[66]
