2        Polar QuestionsPolar questions are defined here as questions that seek the answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’. A
polar question has the form of an indicative clause marked by the phrase-final
particle su. Elicited and natural discourse examples do not show an intonation
pattern distinct from that of affirmative clauses.
  In most examples the interrogative particle has mid tone:(1) Taú tá lúmò su
    T. go market Q
    ‘did Tau go to the market?’(2) hí wé ndày só           ndày       su
    2PL saw 3PL.O house 3PL.POSS Q
    ‘did you see them at their place?’Based on natural discourse data, low tone on the interrogative particle places
emphasis on the proposition in question (the voiceless fricative /s/ is some-
times voiced in intervocalic position):

    ‘“Is it Taobay?”’Lower tone also places emphasis on the question word:(5) ɓà     ha də̀ we      sakə         sà sù

    ‘So how will you know who is who?’(6) mum sà su
    3M who Q
    ‘who is he?’ (similar to ‘who does he think he is?’)The assertive marker si before the interrogative particle places emphasis on the
unexpectedness of the event. Here the interrogative marker has mid tone:(7) Taú tá lúmò tám kə             bə̀kà     si        su
    T. go market today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
    ‘did Tau actually go to the market this morning?’ (I told him to)(8) mum tá lúmò si               su
    3M go market ASSERT Q
    ‘did he really go to the market?’ (I told him not to)The marker si cannot be used in a content question, which seeks additional
information about the event. This is evidence for the assertive function of si, as
described in chapter 9, since the speaker cannot advise the hearer to believe in
a state or event that is not fully described:(9) ha tá ka       tám (*si)            su
    2M go where today (ASSERT) Q
    ‘where did you go to today?’ (i.e. I know you went somewhere, but I don’t
    know where)                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

tions the truth value of a single element of the proposition:Speaker 1:(10) Taú tá Garoua tám-á
     T. go G.        today-FV
     ‘Tau went to Garoua today’Speaker 2:(11) mum tá ka        tám si         su
     3M go where today ASSERT Q
     ‘he went where today?’ (the speaker wants the hearer to believe that the
     subject did not go)Cf. the neutral content question:(12) mum tá ka        tám su
     3M go where today Q
     ‘where did he go today?’The polar question marker may co-occur with a marker of modality, e.g., the
permission marker ye. This is evidence that the interrogative mood does not
belong to the same domain as the deontic and epistemic modalities described
in chapter 9:(13) á         ɬe ɗérwa ye       su

3       Content QuestionsContent questions are defined here as questions seeking additional informa-
tion about an event or state whose truth value is taken for granted. Coding
means involved in content questions include content question words, prepo-
sitions, and the clause-final interrogative particle su. The grammatical role of
the constituent in question is coded as it is in the affirmative clause, by linear
order or preposition.","[242, 243, 244]"
"6.11     Interrogatives
All interrogatives in Pévé, whether polar (‘yes/no’) questions or content ques-
tions, are marked by the phrase-final particle su. Grammatical roles are marked
in the interrogative clause as they are in the affirmative clause. Tense, aspect
and mood are also marked as they are in the affirmative clause. Content ques-
tions distinguish between the human constituent, represented by sa ‘who’, and
the non-human, inanimate or abstract constituent, represented by mi ‘what’.
Content questions also distinguish among questions concerning manner (ma
‘how’) and location (ka ‘where’). Questions concerning the time of an event or
the cause of an event are marked by the prepositional phrases zə̀ mi ‘why’ (lit.
‘for what’) and kə ma ‘when’ (lit. ‘with how’).",[34]
"         Chapter 13: Interrogatives         AbstractThis chapter describes the means used in Pévé to code polar (‘yes/no’) questions and
content questions. All interrogatives are characterized by the presence of the clause-
final particle su. The coding of grammatical roles in the interrogative clause is the same
as that in the affirmative clause, with the exception of certain verbless interrogatives
concerning the identity of the deictic subject. Content questions code the following
distinctions: human constituent; non-human, inanimate or abstract constituent; man-
ner; place; reason; and means.",[380]

A question about the identity of a human participant in an event involves the
question word sa ‘who’, whose grammatical role is coded as it is in the affirma-
tive clause. The interrogative marker su occurs at the end of the clause:(14) sa dám mbraw ne nùm su
     who sew clothes ADP 3M.O Q
     ‘who sewed clothes for him?’Cf.(15) ta dám mbraw ne nùm su
     3F sew clothes ADP 3M.O Q
     ‘she sewed clothes for him?’The role of the question word as possessor is coded by the position after the
possessum, as it is in the affirmative clause:(16) hu sa víʔ su
     goat who lost Q
     ‘whose goat is lost?’(17) mum wə́     bàr só        sá su
     3M IMPF live house who Q
     ‘who does he live with?’ (‘he lives in whose house?’)Cf. the affirmative:(18) mum wə́       suk só   màn
     3M IMPF stay house 1SG.POSS
     ‘he lives at my house’A verbless clause with sa as predicate poses a question about the identity of
the human subject. The person, gender, and number of the referent are coded
by the pronominal subject:(19) ta sa su
     3F who Q
     ‘who is she?’
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M who Q
     ‘who is he?’In a question about the identity of a previously mentioned referent, the de-
ducible reference marker nə (see chapter 12, section 3) follows the question
word:(21) ɓay sàanəsu
     ɓay sa          nə    su
     CONJ who        I.PRO Q
     ‘“So who was it?”’The effect of the demonstrative nə may be to place the question word in focus:(22) sa nə       gí    kwáti ne nùm su
     who I.PRO made food ADP 3M.O Q
     ‘who was it who cooked for him?’3.2      Questions about Non-human Constituents
The question word mi ‘what’ is used in questions about non-human or inani-
mate participants and in questions about abstract constituents. The grammat-
ical function of the question word is marked by linear order or by preposition.
The subject role is marked by clause-initial position:(23) mí gí su
     what go Q
     ‘what happened?’The object role is marked by the position after the verb:(24) mum ti mí su
     3M eat what Q
     ‘what did he eat?’(25) ha wàʔ mì su
     2M want what Q
     ‘what do you want?’
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

less clause. The subject is represented by the question word mi ‘what’ and the
predicate is a deictic demonstrative coding the person, gender, and number of
the referent (see chapter 12). The relative marker may precede the demonstra-
tive:(26) mi (mə) ni      su
     what REL PROX.M Q
     ‘what is this?’(27) mi (mə) náyʔ      su
     what (REL) DIST.M Q
     ‘what is that?’3.3      Questions about Reason
There are several ways of posing a question about the cause of or reason for an
event, all of which involve a preposition and the non-human question word mi
‘what’.
   The preposition zə̀ ‘for’ followed by mi ‘what’ indicates a question about
reason. The prepositional phrase, like most adjuncts, may be clause-initial or
clause-final. When zə̀ mi is clause-final, the interrogative particle su follows the
prepositional phrase:(28) mum mbə́ zə̀ mi su
     3M come for what Q
     ‘why did he come?’The prepositional phrase zə̀ mi is one of the few constituents that can precede
the subject of the sentence:(29) zə̀    mi mum mbə́ su
     PREP what 3M come Q
     ‘why did he come?’(30) zə̀ mi mum tsú tʃé           mbì mə su
     for what 3M NEG drink water NEG Q
     ‘why didn’t he drink the water?’The preposition zə̀ also marks the affirmative reason clause (cf. chapter 21):
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3PL      flee PREP grass build fire
     ‘they fled because of the grass fire’At the normal rate of speech the preposition zə̀ may be omitted from the rea-
son question, leaving only the question word mi ‘what’. The structure is thus
the same as a question about a non-human participant in the object role:(32) ha tʃiʔ mí ndə́ na         su
     2M cry what like I.PRO Q
     ‘Why are you crying like that?’(33) ha gí mi tám su
     2M do what today Q
     ‘what did you do today?’A question about reason may be coded by the phrase zə̀ dàn (‘for word/matter’)
followed by the question word mi. The sequence zə̀ dàn mi poses a question
about the fundamental cause or root of an event:(34) ha ʔí      nàn zə̀ dàn               mi su
     2M insult 1SG.O reason (‘for word’) what Q
     ‘why did you insult me?’ (‘what caused you to insult me?’)A question about reason can also be marked by kə́dàn (ASSC ‘word/matter’)
followed by the question word mi and the interrogative marker:(35) mum mbə́ kə́dàn mí su
     3M come PURP what Q
     ‘why did he come?’The phrase kə́dàn also marks the affirmative clause describing the purpose of
an action (see chapter 21):(36) na mbə́ kə́dàn wum ín kwá
     1SG come PURP learn read (lit. ‘speak thing’)
     ‘I came here to learn to read’
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

A question about manner is indicated by the question word ma after the verb,
followed by the interrogative marker su. The question word may be preceded
by the relative marker mə̀, the conditions for which remain to be explored:(37) ha gi (mə) ma su
     2M do (REL) how Q
     ‘how do you do it?’(38) syem(ɗe) màŋ       ɗe ma su
     name       2F.POSS call how Q

     ‘what is your name’ (male addressee)(40) ha gi sin wũ           (mə) ma tam su
     2M do work 2M.POSS REL how today Q
     ‘how did you work today?’ or ‘how did you do your work today?’The question word ma and the question word mi ‘what’ are interchangeable in
some constructions:(41) ha tsoɓ ma/mi      su
     2M buy how/what Q
     ‘how/what are you buying?’(42) ha tì ma/mi        su
     2M eat how/what Q
     ‘how/what are you eating?’3.5     Questions about Time
A question about the time of an event may be marked by the question word ma
‘how’ preceded by the associative preposition kə:(43) Gwà mbə́ kə      ma su
     G. come ASSC how Q
     ‘when did Gwa come?’
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M see 3M.O ASSC how Q
     ‘when did he see him?’3.6      Questions about Quantity
In a question about quantity, the phrase ma dák ‘how many/how much’ follows
the noun whose quantity is in question. As usual, the interrogative marker su
is clause-final:(45) ha tsóɓ ndaʔ ma dák                   su
     2M buy horse how many (‘what amount’) Q
     ‘how many horses did you buy?’3.7      Questions about Location
In a question about the location of an event or an entity, the question word ka
‘where’ follows the verb and precedes the interrogative marker:(46) Taú suk       ka      su
     T. stay, live where Q
     ‘where does Tau live?’(47) ha tá ka      tám su
     2M go where today Q
     ‘where did you go today?’Cf. the affirmative, where the locative complement also follows the verb:(48) ha tá lúmò
     2M go market
     ‘you went to the market’A question about the location of the subject is a verbless clause with ka as the
predicate, followed by su:(49) mum ka         su
     3M where Q
     ‘where is he?’The locative question word may be preceded by the locative complement gaʔ
‘side’, apparently without changing the meaning:

4       ConclusionAll types of interrogatives in Pévé are marked by the clause-final marker su. The
polar question has the form of an affirmative clause followed by su, with gram-
matical roles and other categories marked as they are in the affirmative clause.
Content questions are marked by a set of question words that distinguish
among human referents on the one hand (sa ‘who’) and non-human, inani-
mate, or abstract constituents (mi ‘what’) on the other; manner (ma ‘how’); and
location (ka ‘where’). Further distinctions, including time, reason, and quan-
tity, are coded by prepositional phrases involving the content question words
above. The marker si occurs in a content question only when the question
expresses the speaker’s disbelief in some element of the clause. Grammatical
relations within content questions word are marked as they are in the affirma-
tive clause.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251]"

Pévé-English Lexicon1        IntroductionThe Pévé-English lexicon in this chapter is organized according to the International
Phonetic Alphabet, with some additions and exceptions. In general, the order of vow-
els as entered in the lexicon is i, e, ə, a, o, and u; the consonant or fricative (e.g. ndz,
ʃ ) precedes the palatalized form (ndʒ, ʃy); and the non-glottalized form (b, d) precedes
the glottalized form (ɓ, ɗ ). Because some existing written works on Pévé do not use IPA
symbols, the symbols used in those works are shown in brackets after the correspond-
ing IPA symbols, such as ɓ [b’], dʒ [j, dž]. Abbreviations are used in the lexicon as they
are in the text.
    As shown in chapter 2 (Phonology), there are a number of free variations in pro-
nunciation, especially in morphemes that begin with a stop or fricative followed by a
high or mid front vowel. In the Pévé-English lexicon, the Pévé form in the left-hand col-
umn represents the native speaker’s perception of the underlying form, e.g. ʃinè ‘field’,
while the form in the right-hand column of the English-Pévé lexicon (chapter 24) may
include the underlying form and free variations as transcribed by the author, e.g. ʃinè
or sine.
    Needless to say, the two lexicons do not represent a complete list of lexical items and
morphemes in the Pévé language; there are many more to be examined and described.
The items listed below represent those attested in the data and others whose forms
and/or translations may be of interest to the reader.","[346, 347, 348]"
"3.3.1       Form
The progressive aspect is marked by the perfective form of the copula ké (some-
times with the surface form kə́) followed by the main verb (cf. chapter 11 for use
of ké as the copular main verb). The verb following ké is unmarked and carries
its underlying tone:(50) tá ké      gi tsoɓ mbìr kə       fə́tá
     3F PROG sell        milk ASSC dry season
     ‘she used to sell milk during the dry season’(51) Gwà ké       suk       wə    Mayo-Lope si
     G. PROG stay, live PREP M.-L.               ASSERT
     ‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope (lit. ‘river-mud’ (Ful.); a village where Pévé
     is spoken)’Reference to an ongoing event that may occur after the time of speech is indi-
cated by the imperfective marker wə́ before the future tense construction də +
Verb (see chapter 11):(52) námbà wə́      də suk fəta tam kə           bãrĩ mba
     1PL     IMPF FUT stay day today ASSC Bar today
     ‘We will be spending the day today with Bar.’3.3.2      Function
Evidence that the marker ké does not mark the past tense is that ké can be used
in a clause with an adverbial referring to the time of speech. The function of
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
tense and aspect                                                                 149such a clause is to indicate that an ongoing state or event ended precisely at
the time of speech:(53) ta ni ké          ge ndoʔ sin sə́          na
     3F now PROG finish work 3F.POSS I.PRO
     ‘she is just now finishing her work’ (in answer to ‘what is she doing?’)(54) ta ké        dayri mgbaŋ ni na
     3F PROG arrive just now now I.PRO
     ‘she is just now arriving’ (in answer to ‘where is she right now?’)The progressive aspect differs from the perfective aspect in that a clause mark-
ed for progressive aspect may refer to an uncompleted or ongoing event prior
to the time of speech:(55) ta ké     ɗi     fún ɓay ta ké          gi tsoɓ rùm        lúmò
     3F PROG make food CONJ 3F PROG sell               3M.POSS market
     ‘she was making food and she was selling it at the market’Cf. the perfective aspect, which codes completion of the event before the time
of speech:(56) ta ɗí    fún ɓay ta gí tsoɓ rum lúmò
     3F make food CONJ 3F sell         3M.O market
     ‘she made food and sold it at the market’The progressive aspect differs from the imperfective aspect in that the latter
describes an event that is ongoing at the time of speech:(57) ta wə́     ɗi    fún ɓay ta wə́          də̀ gi tsoɓ rum      lúmò
     3F IMPF make food CONJ 3F IMPF go sell                3M.POSS market
     ‘she is making food (right now) and selling it at the market’In some cases the same event can be described using either the perfective
aspect or the progressive aspect, with a slight difference in meaning. In the
following examples, use of the perfective aspect indicates that the event, what-
ever its duration, is completed, while use of the progressive focuses on the
duration of the past event. This distinction is expressed in the English trans-
lations:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     baby lie down night all the time ASSC cry-FV
     ‘the baby cried all night’Progressive:(59) vay ké       bá(r)      dùkrí kerker  kə   tʃiʔ-i
     baby PROG lie down night all the time ASSC cry-FV
     ‘the baby was crying all night long’Perfective:(60) na tí kúm-ú
     1SG go day before yesterday
     ‘I went the day before yesterday’Progressive:(61) na ké        ti kúm-ú
     1SG PROG go day before yesterday
     ‘I was going the day before yesterday’As is often the case with markers of aspect, the specific aspectual or temporal
function of ké may depend on surrounding discourse and/or knowledge shared
by the speaker and hearer. The following example may thus have several inter-
pretations:(62) Gwà ké        súk       wə     Mayo-Lope
     G. PROG stay, live PREP M.-L.
     ‘Gwa lived/was living/used to live in Mayo-Lope’ (in answer to a question
     or as a preface to a sequential clause)Use of additional markers outside of the domains of tense and aspect may be
used to narrow the meaning of the clause (English translations are approxi-
mate):(63) Gwà ké      súk        wə    Mayo-Lope si
     G. PROG stay, live PREP M.-L.          ASSERT
     ‘Gwa lived/was living in Mayo-Lope’                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
tense and aspect                                                                 151or(64) Gwà ké      suk        wə    Mayo-Lope riʔ-i
     G. PROG live, stay PREP M.-L.          already-FV
     ‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’In many cases the clause marked for progressive aspect provides information
necessary for the proper understanding of the clause that follows, as in the next
example:(65) ta ké       ɓáy kum           àmá tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi
     3F PROG pretty yesterday but today 3F NEG pretty still NEG
     ‘she used to be pretty, but she isn’t pretty anymore’ (note the use of kum
     ‘yesterday’ in broad reference to the past)The progressive aspect in Pévé can be used in an independent clause whose
proper interpretation depends on the clause that preceded it in conversation.
For example, the progressive may be used in a response to a content question,
whose inherent function is to seek more information about a given situation.
The clause marked for progressive aspect provides that information:(66) na ké        in      dàn kə       rù
     1SG PROG speak word ASSC 2M.POSS
     ‘I was talking to you’ (in answer to ‘what were you doing?’)3.4      Unmarked Aspect
3.4.1      Form
The unmarked aspect is characterized by underlying tone on the verb and the
absence of a non-verbal tense or aspect marker. The unmarked aspect is found
in both independent clauses and dependent clauses:(67) na wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
     1SG want leave PERM
     ‘I want to leave’(68) na tsú bə̀ ɬew də́ mi
     1SG NEG like meat dog NEG
     ‘I don’t like dog meat’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
152                                                                    chapter 8(69) mum tʃí vun rùm-u         syemɗe ùm      ɗe ma su
     3M ask 3M.POSS-FV name 3M.POSS call how Q
     ‘He asked him, “What do they call him?”’The unmarked aspect is the form used in subjunctive clauses, as marked by a
subject pronoun from the subjunctive set (see chapter 6):(70) à láʔá               fãmbə       tám-a
     ha láʔ á             faŋ mbə     tám-a
     2M say 1SG.SBJV repeat come today-FV
     ‘you said I should come here again today’(71) à          pum nùm ye
     2M.SBJV hit 3M.O PERM
     ‘hit him!’ or ‘you can hit him!’ (‘can’ is used here in the permissive sense)The imperfective aspect marker wə́ can be optional in a clause referring to an
unbounded event. Since the verb following the imperfective marker has its
underlying tone, deleting wə́ results in a clause in the unmarked tense/aspect,
raising the question of whether there really is an unmarked tense/aspect:(72) May (wə́) ɗi fún ɓay Gwà (wə́) gi tsoɓ rum              lúmò
     M. IMPF cook food CONJ G. IMPF sell             3M.POSS market
     ‘May cooks food and Gwa sells it at the market’The evidence that there is an unmarked aspectual form that is distinct from the
imperfective or any other aspect is provided by the fact that there are indica-
tive clauses in which neither the perfective high tone nor an overt tense/aspect
marker, including wə́, can be used. This is true of the subjunctive clause below:(73) mum *wə́/*də̀     gewa mbə̀ sədayʔ         dáyʔ
     3M IMPF/FUT return come day after tomorrow day after
     for ‘he should come back in three days’In the following example, the verb ɗə is not marked for tense or aspect and can
occur only in its underlying form. Reference to the future is provided solely by
the temporal adverbial siw:(74) à          ɗə/*ɗə́ nan siw-i
     2M.SBJV call       1SG.O tomorrow-FV
     ‘call me tomorrow’                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
tense and aspect                                                               153  Similarly with the verb mbə̀ ‘come’, which retains its underlying low tone
even in reference to the future:(75) Taú láʔ mum mbə̀ siw-i
     T. say 3M come tomorrow-FV
     ‘Tau said he will come tomorrow’In the main clause of the following example neither wə́ (IMPF) or də̀ (FUT)
can be used before the verb ‘to say’. The use of the non-perfective pronoun ùm
to indicate the addressee rules out the perfective interpretation, leaving the
unmarked aspect as the only possible meaning:(76) lum gwàʔ *wə́/*də̀       ùm in ne na      à   kar riʔ
     lion then IMPF/FUT 3M.O say ADP I.PRO 2M.SBJV look already
     mbə̀ tí          rìʔi
     come PROX.F already
     for ‘Lion then says to him, “Look here!”’Compare with the perfective form, where the addressee is marked by nùm, not
ùm, and the adposition ne precedes the addressee. The future marker is omit-
ted in the complement clause, leaving only the choice of pronoun (màn, the
non-perfective 1SG object) and the constituent order SOV as markers of the
non-perfective aspect:(77) mum lɛ́ʔ né nəm ha lambə                   sí       ha man yè
     mum láʔ ne nùm ha láʔ              mbə̀ si          ha màn yè
     3M say ADP 3M.O 2M COND come ASSERT 2M 1SG.O know
     si
     si
     ASSERT
     ‘He told him, “If you come here, you will know me.” ’3.4.2       Function
The interpretation of the unmarked aspect depends on context. When there
is no adverbial or other marker indicating the temporal structure of the event,
the unmarked aspect may be interpreted as pertaining to the time of speech,
as is the case with the form waʔ ‘want’ in the following:
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     REL           last time pass I.PRO
     ‘I want to tell the story about my most recent trip from Maroua to Garoua
     last Friday.’The unmarked aspect may also indicate a habitual or unbounded event. Use of
a temporal adverbial may narrow the scope of the unmarked aspect:(79) tá gi tsoɓ súm ( fə̀tà lúmò)
     3F sell      beer day market
     ‘she sells beer (on the day of the market)’The unmarked aspect may describe an unbounded state that obtains at the
time of speech:(80) Gwà toŋ pã          May si
     G. large exceed M. ASSERT
     ‘Gwa is bigger than May’The unmarked aspect may also describe an unbounded state that obtained
prior to the time of speech:(81) motaʔ         ɗáw tsugàk          tsùwal mi
     mòtaʔ (borr.) ɗáw tsú         gàk tsùwal mi
     car (Ful.)    one NEG can cross NEG
     ‘Not one car could cross it.’ (before the time of speech)The constituent order in the unmarked tense/aspect is the same as that of a
clause in any other non-perfective aspect (see chapter 6). In the next example,
the order S V O IO ne, along with the choice of pronoun from the non-perfective
set, makes it clear that the clause is non-perfective, even though there is no
overt tense/aspect marker:
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the clause as subjunctive):(87) ì        mbə̀ ni         riʔ-i

marker də̀; the perfective aspect, marked by relative high tone on the verb;
the imperfective aspect, marked by the preverbal marker wə́; the progressive
aspect, marked by the preverbal marker ké; and the unmarked aspect, charac-
terized by underlying tone on the verb and the absence of any other external
markers. Only the unmarked aspect is attested in the subjunctive clause.
   The perfective aspect describes a singulative event that was or will be com-
pleted, while the imperfective describes a state or event ongoing at the time of
speech or some other specified time. The progressive aspect marks a clause as
essential to understanding the material that follows the marked clause or as a
response to a preceding question. The interpretation of the unmarked aspect
depends on context and the nature of the event. In the indicative clause, the
unmarked aspect may refer to ongoing, repeated, habitual or unbounded event;
in the subjunctive clause, the unmarked aspect may also refer to a bounded or
singulative event.","[164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"

3       ConclusionPévé is an active language whose speakers are well aware of the need to pre-
serve their language, cultural activities, and intercultural relations in a world
in which political, social, and economic affairs can lead to the loss of language
and traditions. The goal of the present work is to document and preserve some
of the interesting and important characteristics of Pévé for the benefit of gen-
erations to come. With respect to nomenclature, the present work adopts the
educated native-speaker Wambadang’s view that Pévé is a language distinct
from Zimé; that the term Lamé also refers to Pévé; that dialects of Pévé include
Dari, Doué, and perhaps others; that (Vun) Dzəbao, Gumaji and Herdé may
be either remote dialects of Pévé or pidgin languages that are influenced by
both Pévé and Mesme (Chadic, East Branch); and that the term Kaʔɗó (and
its variants) is not acceptable as a name for the Pévé language or culture. The
present work does not attempt to answer further questions about classification
but focuses instead on lexical and grammatical forms in Pévé and the functions
they encode.
    While Pévé shares many forms and functions with other languages of the
Chadic family, particularly those of the Masa branch, the Pévé language also has
a number of unique or unusual features. One such feature is that the choice of
pronoun(s) in a given clause is often the only means of indicating the temporal,
aspectual, and/or modal properties of the clause. In other words, the language
has a number of distinct sets of pronouns whose function is not only to indi-
cate the gender, number and syntactic role of a participant but also the tense,
aspect or mood of the clause. Despite the large system of pronouns, the gram-
matical gender system is limited to singular second- and third-person pronouns
and a small set of nouns that are inherently feminine or masculine. Another
interesting feature of Pévé is that the scope of the negative clause is that of the
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

ture is that while Pévé has a rich system of reference that distinguishes among
anaphoric, deictic, and deducible referents, nouns in Pévé are rarely marked for
number (singular or plural). The language also has a rich system of modality
that includes the unusual counterfactual mood, whereby a dedicated marker
indicates that the event described in the proposition did not occur.","[38, 39]"

AcknowledgmentsI am extremely grateful to Lazare Wambadang, a native speaker of Pévé who
is also fluent in French and English and without whom the present project
could not have been accomplished. Wambadang has selflessly devoted a great
amount of time and energy to describing and analyzing Pévé and creating
the present volume, and his enthusiasm has been an important part of the
project. I am also grateful to the American Council of Learned Societies, which
provided significant financial support for the project. I sincerely thank Henry
Tourneux, who provided essential logistical and personal support before and
during the fieldwork; Venasius Lendzemo and Noë Woin of the Institute de
Récherche Agricole pour le Développement (IRAD) in Cameroon, who also
provided logistical support for the fieldwork; Rodney Venberg, who has very
generously shared his own work on Pévé and provided many helpful comments
regarding the present work; the kind and supportive staff at Le Relais de la
Porte Mayo in Maroua; and Zygmunt Frajzyngier, whose assistance was crucial
before, during, and after the fieldwork and who provided much thoughtful and
detailed advice concerning the present work. Praat software (http://www.fon
.hum.uva.nl/praat/) was extremely useful for analyzing tone in the texts that
are the basis of the grammatical analysis. I also thank the publisher’s reviewer
for useful questions and suggestions concerning the document, all of which
have been taken into account in the final version.
    I greatly admire the Pévé people for striving to maintain their language and
culture through peaceful measures despite social, political and changes of a
kind that have led to the loss of languages over centuries and across the world.
I sincerely hope that the present volume will be of use to native and non-native
speakers of Pévé and to speakers of languages that are related to, or have been in
contact with, the Pévé language. Because collaborator Wambadang is a native
speaker of Pévé, any errors in the transcription, translation or analysis of Pévé
are mine.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

tion kə and the noun dàn ‘word, matter’, marks the clause that follows as the
purpose of the preceding clause:(74) nambà ùm ɗe          kə     Bár ɓay mum də taʔ semɗe um
     1PL     3M.O name ASSC Bar CONJ 3M go also name 3M.POSS

     1SG take calabash PL PURP sell          3M.POSS-FV
     ‘I took the calabashes to sell them’The same-subject purpose clause may have an overt subject, which renders it
an independent clause:(78) handày mbə́ kə́dàn handày káw ɓá                  ndʒì
     3PL     come PURP 3PL          help (‘take hand’) RECIP
     ‘they came so that they could help each other’In the following sentence the purpose clause is not marked by kə́dàn and does
not have a subject. The result is a sequence of two compound verbs, ʔyá táy ‘to
depart for’ and gi tsoɓ ‘to sell’. Omission of the purpose marker kə́dàn is a likely
source for some serial verb constructions:

7       Reason ClausesAn adjunct clause describing the reason or cause for an event may be marked
by the preposition zə̀ ‘for, under’:(80) mum lɛ́ʔ né nəm ha lambə                  ha man         yè
     mum láʔ ne nùm ha láʔ               mbə̀ ha màn (də̀) yè

     ‘He told him, “If you come here, you (will) know me because my head is
     whitish.”’(81) handày pík né zə̀      zá     ɗám kú
     3PL      flee PREP brush build fire
     ‘they fled because of the brush fire’The preposition zə̀ followed by the question word mi forms a question about
reason (cf. chapter 13):(82) zə̀    mi ha ʔí         nàn su
     PREP what 2M insult 1SG.O Q
     ‘why did you insult me?’
8       Positive AdjunctPévé has an adjunct whose function is to emphasize the existence or actuality
of an event or state. Native speaker Wambadang views the function of kətáʔ
as the opposite of that of the negative marker tsu … mi (see chapter 14), hence
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

sentence-final or clause-final position. The English translation is approximate:(83) ha wé kwa tí            kətaʔ-a
     2M see thing PROX.F POS-FV
     ‘you really saw something’(84) mum làʔ         də̀ mbə̀ kətáʔ si sáyʔ  na gíláʔ tú
     3M COND FUT come POS REL OBLIG 1SG ready body
     rìn-ì
     1SG.POSS-FV
     ‘if he actually comes, I must be ready’Evidence that kətáʔ is an adjunct is that the form can be deleted from a sen-
tence with very little change in meaning. In the following sentence, the use of
kətáʔ emphasizes the past-time temporal status of the clause:(85) namba ké kə́       sə̀lay kətáʔ-a
     1PL    COP ASSC money POS-FV
     ‘we used to have money’ (but not anymore)Removing kətaʔ does not affect grammatical or temporal relations, but simply
removes emphasis from the temporal status:(86) namba ké kə́       sə̀lay-a
     1PL     COP ASSC money-FV
     ‘we used to have money’Further evidence for the positive function of kətaʔ is that the form cannot occur
in the same clause with the negative marker (tsu) … mi:(87) ta tsú kə        sə̀lày mì *kətáʔ-a
     3F NEG ASSC money NEG POS-FV
     for ‘she does not have money’ (or any other meaning)It is likely that the first syllable of the positive marker kətáʔ stems from the
associative preposition kə. A potential source for the syllable táʔ is the verb táʔ
‘show’ (see chapter 8 and elsewhere).","[330, 331, 332, 333]"

The marker si, analyzed here as the marker of assertive mood, can occur in
several positions: clause- or sentence-final position; the position immediately
before the clause-final interrogative marker su; or the position immediately
before a sentence-final adjunct. The implications of these possibilities are
described later in the chapter. Here are examples involving the marker si:Clause-final:(55) ndʒɪn màn          ɮɛ́ si
     ndʒin màn          ɮé si
     story 1SG.POSS start ASSERT
     ‘My story starts right now.’Before the interrogative marker:(56) ha wé      si       su
     2M know ASSERT Q
     ‘did you know (that)?’/‘did you see (that)?’The assertive marker can also be used in a question that is marked for future
tense. This provides evidence that the assertive marker does not code a func-
tion in the domain of tense (see chapter 8):(57) nambà də̀ ndewa                      ʃíw      si     su
     1PL      FUT meet (lit. ‘fall head’) tomorrow ASSERT Q
     ‘will we see each other tomorrow?’The marker si also occurs at the end of all recorded conditional protasis clauses:(58) laʔ      hi wə́      də̀ lumo si       i dʒi wa
     COND 2PL IMPF go market ASSERT 2PL.SBJV wait head
     rìn-i
     1SG.POSS-F
     ‘if you go to the market, wait for me’The assertive marker si can also occur at the end of the apodosis clause, i.e., at
the end of the complex sentence:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     COND 3M IMPF 3F.O hit ASSERT 3F.SBJV leave ASSERT
     ‘if he is hitting her, she should leave’The marker si follows some, but not all, temporal protasis clauses (see also
chapter 18):(60) kəri məni handày gí sin ndày             ndóʔ wə       ʃìnè si
     when      3PL      do work 3PL.POSS finish PREP field ASSERT
     handày géwa tá só           ndày-a
     3PL     return DIR house 3PL.POSS
     ‘when they finished their work in the field, they went back home’Cf. the temporal protasis without si:(61) kəri məni ta gé ndoʔ sin sə́          ta pemãy(-a)
     when      3F finish work 3F.POSS 3F rest(-FV)
     ‘when she finished her work, she rested’The evidence that si does not mark the boundary between the protasis and the
apodosis is that si in the protasis clause can be followed by an adverbial adjunct
that modifies the preceding clause:(62) kəri məni mum làʔ      ʔwáy gàyʔ sì          dáŋʔ mum par          vay
     when      3M COND win game ASSERT all 3M remove child

     3M eat meat 3M.POSS ASSERT all-FV
     ‘he ate all his meat’Moreover, in the temporal construction the protasis clause (bolded in the fol-
lowing example) does not have to end in si:(64) dayna dùkri mə̀ tám (pause) handày də̀ tsòɓ ndá màn
     after night REL today             3PL     FUT buy horse 1SG.POSS

The marker si indicates that the speaker wants the hearer to believe in the
truth or actuality of the event or state described by the clause that precedes
the marker si. The temporal status of the event or state may be the past, the
time of speech, or the future. The evidence for the assertive function is pro-
vided by examining the circumstances in which si does and does not occur and
contrasting the function of si with the functions of other morphemes and con-
structions.
    The evidence that si codes a function in the domain of affirmative modality
is that the marker cannot co-occur with the negative marker:(65) motaʔ         ɗáw tsugàk          tsùwal mi *si
     mòtaʔ (borr.) ɗáw tsú         gàk tsùwal mi *si
     car (Ful.)    one NEG can cross NEG ASSERT
     ‘Not one car could cross it.’The marker si also cannot be used in a content question that seeks additional
information about the event:(66) Taú tá ka       tám kə       bə̀kà   (*si) su
     T. go where today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
     for ‘where did Tau go this morning?’However, the marker si can be used in a polar question marked by the clause-
final interrogative su. The result is a polar question seeking confirmation of the
speaker’s assertion/belief that an event took place or will take place:(67) Taú tá lúmò tám kə             bə̀kà     si       su
     T. go market today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
     ‘did Tau (really) go to the market this morning?’The marker si cannot follow an incomplete clause:(68) ma        tʃí vun rùm-u  *si      ha mbə́ wàʔ mi su
     woman ask 3M.POSS ASSERT 2M come want what Q
     for ‘the woman asked him, “Why did you come here?” ’The evidence that the clause is incomplete is that it cannot stand alone:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     woman ask 3M.POSS ASSERT
     for ‘the woman asked him’Although si is often used in describing an event that took place in the past, it
is not a marker of tense or aspect. There are several pieces of evidence for this.
First, si can follow a clause marked for the future tense:(70) hí də̀ ndewa síw              si      su
     2PL FUT meet tomorrow ASSERT Q
     ‘will you (PL) see each other tomorrow?’(71) dayna dùkri mə̀ tám (pause) ta də̀ ge            ndoʔ sin sə́
     after night REL today               3F FUT throw finish work 3F.POSS
     si
     ASSERT
     ‘after tonight, she will finish her work’Second, si can follow a clause in the perfective aspect, marked by high tone on
the verb, or a clause in the progressive aspect, marked by the aspect marker ké.
If the marker si had a function in the domain of aspect, it would not co-occur
with other aspect markers:Perfective with si:(72) ndʒin man        ndózu       si
     ndʒin man        ndóʔ zù     sì

     G. PROG stay PREP M.-L.            ASSERT
     ‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’Evidence that si does not code the completed or bounded nature of the event
is that the marker si can follow a clause describing an ongoing state:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     price 3M.POSS IMPF COP much ASSERT
     ‘its price may be high’As previously noted, a conditional clause referring to a potential future event
must be marked by si. The conditional protasis clause describes an event or
state that may or may not occur in the future, which might seem contradictory
to the notion of the assertive modality. In fact, this explains the obligatory use of
si in the conditional protasis clause: The assertive marker advises the hearer to
believe in the content of the protasis clause, without which the apodosis would
have no validity (see chapter 18 for a description of conditional constructions):(76) laʔ        tsoɓ rum         ɓáyrúm si,      i     tsoɓ gaʔ ri məsin

     ta gak     mi
     3F be able NEG
     ‘May thought she could drive a car, but she couldn’t’Perhaps the strongest evidence for the function of the marker si is the follow-
ing example, where si occurs at the end of a clause describing a potential event
that did not actually occur. The presence of si advises the hearer to believe that
the event could have occurred. The marker kə̀zə́, glossed CF for ‘counterfactual’,
indicates the speaker’s knowledge that the event did not actually occur. The
scope of the assertive mood is thus the speaker’s wish for the hearer’s belief,
not the speaker’s own belief or knowledge with respect to whether the event
or state actually took place in the real world:

Negation in Pévé is unusual in two respects, namely dual marking of negation
and the scope of negation. Negation of the indicative clause is marked by the
negative marker tsú immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the
negative marker mì at the end of the clause. The marker tsú can be omitted
only if the negative clause is a response to a question.
   An interesting feature of Pévé is that whether or not tsú occurs, the scope
of the negative clause is the entire proposition. Attempts to elicit interrogative
sentences in which only one constituent is negated, e.g. the equivalent of ‘he
bought a cow, not a goat’, resulted in two separate clauses, one affirmative and
one negative: ‘he bought a cow; he did not buy a goat’. Unlike in some Chadic
languages, the coding of tense and aspect in the negative clause in Pévé is the
same as that in the affirmative clause.","[34, 35]"

         chapter 1The Pévé Language1        IntroductionThe present volume is the first full description of the grammar of Pévé, a Chadic
language spoken in parts of the southwestern area of the Republic of Chad
and the Northern province of the Republic of Cameroon. Data for this volume
were gathered in the course of fieldwork in Cameroon during the summer of
2012 and supplemented by additional data gathered from native speakers. The
present volume also draws on the works of Rodney Venberg, Herrmann Jun-
graithmayr and Michka Sachnine for additional and comparative data (section
3, below).","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"
"                                                                                Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

this does not appear to be phonemic:yii /yi/       ‘squirrel’
goo /go/       (word of consolation, permission or politeness; see chapter 9)
ngoo /ngo/     ‘dry tree (ready to be cut down and burned)’
saa /sa/       ‘who’ (content question word)
ʒyèe /ʒyè/     ‘peanut(s)’3.2       Nasalized Vowels
The nasalized vowels /ĩ, ẽ, ã, õ, ũ/ are attested in open syllables, before the glot-
tal stop, and before the palatal and alveolar glides. In all of these environments,
nasalized vowels contrast with non-nasalized (oral) vowels:vĩ        ‘vast, limitless’ vs. vìʔ ‘to lose (something)’
kĩ ́     ‘small’ vs. ki ‘back; backside of something’
nẽʔ       ‘hippopotamus’, ‘curse’ (N) vs. ne ‘to give’
mbã       ‘to respect’ vs. mbà (1PL object pronoun)
gwãʔ      (tiny flying insect) vs. gwáʔ ‘then’
gã        ‘brush, low trees’; ‘to freeload’ vs. gàʔ ‘side’
sowã      ‘people’ vs. so ‘house, village’
bùwõ ̀   ‘rain’ (N) vs. ɓo (modal particle)
wũ        (2M object pronoun) vs. wuʔ ‘to pour a liquid’
wãy       ‘last, most recent’ vs. ʔway ‘to herd, to chase’
nãw       ‘bovine’ vs. ɗáw ‘one’Some nasalized vowels are clearly surface realizations of an underlying se-
quence of a vowel followed by a nasal consonant. For example, when the noun
ʃĩŋ ‘smell’ (nasalized vowel) is followed by the trill /r/, as in ʃiŋ rùm ‘his smell’,
the nasalized vowel in ʃĩŋ is replaced by an oral vowel ( ʃiŋ), providing evidence
that /ʃiŋ/ is the underlying form. Further evidence that the nasalized vowel is
not underlying is provided by use of the oral vowel in the reduplicated form
ʃi-ʃĩ (non-nasalized+nasalized) ‘to smell something’.
    Phrase-final vowel addition, in its function as parsing morphology (chap-
ter 3), provides clues for the origin of some nasalized vowels. When the phrase-
internal form or isolated form of a lexical item ends in a nasalized vowel,
phrase-final vowel addition sometimes results in a velar nasal consonant
flanked by oral vowels. For example, the noun bùwõ ̀ ‘rain’ becomes bùwòŋò in
phrase-final position, suggesting that nasalization of the final /o/ in bùwõ ̀ had
its origins in an underlying final velar nasal consonant.","[55, 56]"

5       Notes on the TranscriptionIn transcriptions of natural discourse data, the top line represents the author’s
auditory perception of the utterance of the native speaker, sometimes with
the help of the Praat program (www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/). The second line
shows the underlying form of each morpheme used in the utterance. In tran-
scriptions throughout the text there are some inconsistencies in the underlying
form, as it is not always clear which form is underlying and which represents a
variation. This is complicated by dialectal variations in the pronunciation of a
given form.
   The third line in a natural discourse example contains the gloss of the under-
lying meaning and/or function of each element of the utterance, in accordance
with the Leipzig glossing rules. The fourth line consists of a colloquial English
translation of the Pévé utterance. Here is an example of a natural discourse
transcription. The term ‘lit.’ refers to the literal or underlying meaning of a
form:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

    ‘He asked him.’ (FV: final vowel; see chapter 2)Some examples occur more than once in the present volume. The translation,
and occasionally the gloss, of a given example may differ slightly from one
occurrence to another, depending on the topic of the surrounding narrative
and the function(s) that the example has been chosen to demonstrate.
   Elicited examples consist of three lines: The underlying morphemes, as per-
ceived by speaker and listener; the gloss showing the meaning and/or function
of each morpheme; and the English translation of the utterance. The transla-
tion of an elicited example begins with a capital letter only if the first element
of the utterance is a proper name. An elicited example may end with a question
mark, an exclamation point, or zero punctuation:(2) à          mbə̀ riʔ-i

    ‘he saw me on the road’ (zero punctuation)In the top line (i.e. Pévé form) of the transcription, a slash between two mor-
phemes indicates that either morpheme, but not both, can be used in the same
utterance:(4) ma/swə                  wé nàn-a
    person (f.)/person (m.) see 1SG.O-FV
    ‘someone saw me’Slashes between morphemes on the gloss level indicate that the morpheme in
question has multiple meanings or functions:(5) mum kəɗam          kə    sowã dáŋʔ

form has more than one pronunciation, as in tsóhoʔ ~ tswóhoʔ ‘eight’ and go ~
gwaʔ ‘then’. Partially or fully reduplicated forms are marked by a word-internal
hyphen, as in ryéŋ-ryéŋ(e) ‘very small, thin’ and tʃiriŋ-riŋ ‘very deep’.
   A parenthesized component in the Pévé form is considered by the native
speaker to be optional in the utterance in question:(6) May (wə́) ɗi fún
    M. IMPF cook food
    ‘May cooks food’ (ɗi fún and wə́ ɗi fún have the same meaning)A parenthesized component in the English translation is intended for clarifi-
cation and does not directly correspond to any morpheme in the Pévé version,
e.g.:(7) na tsoɓ ʒyè           wũ ne ɓo
    1SG buy peanuts 2M.O ADP PROM
    ‘I (will) definitely buy you some peanuts’A bracketed morpheme or phrase in the top line or second line of a natural dis-
course example represents a self-correction made by the native speaker after
listening to a recording of his own text:(8) ɓay mùm tʃí vun rùmu           [syemɗe rùm …] (error) syemɗe

    ‘… and he (guinea fowl) asked him, “What is his name?” ’ (rùm: 3M inalien-
    able possessor; ùm: 3M alienable possessor; see chapter 5)As is the case in many languages, there is often free variation in the pronun-
ciation of certain phonemes, especially those that involve a stop or fricative
followed by a high or mid front vowel. This is particularly true with respect
to underlying vs. surface tone, since the latter may be affected by intonation
and stress patterns, which themselves may be affected by context, previous dis-
course, the speaker’s motivation, and other factors. The phonemic structure
and tone of examples throughout the text are transcribed as heard by the lis-
tener but do not always represent the underlying form from the native speaker’s
perspective. As a result, there may be inconsistencies in the transcription of

verbless and copular predications                                                 199Furthermore, like other verbs (see chapter 8), kè carries high tone when the
clause refers to a time before the time of speech:(17) ta ké bay màn-à
     3F COP friend 1SG-FV
     ‘she was my friend’In an equational predication with future time reference, the copula has low
tone and is preceded by the future tense marker də̀, providing further evidence
that kè is a verb while na is not:(18) ta də̀ kè bay màn-a
     3F FUT COP friend 1SG-FV
     ‘she will be my friend’Cf. the form with reference to the time of speech (recall that na is not necessary
in an equational clause of the form Pronoun Noun):(19) ta bay màn-a
     3F friend 1SG-FV
     ‘she is my friend’As previously mentioned, the clause-final impersonal pronoun na rarely co-
occurs with another clause-final marker. A content question about the identity
of a human participant (see chapter 13) has the form of an equational predica-
tion whose predicate is the content question word sa ‘who’. The clause-final
impersonal pronoun na does not occur, since the clause-final interrogative
marker su itself marks the end of the clause:(20) ta sa su
     3F who Q
     ‘who is she?’ (lit. ‘she [is] who?’)A question about a non-human participant has mi ‘what’ as the subject and
a deictic demonstrative as the predicate. The relative marker mə before the
demonstrative is optional and the impersonal pronoun na does not occur:(21) mi (mə)ni su
     what PROX Q
     ‘what [is] this?’
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘what [is] that?’3.2      Pronoun as Predicate
An equational predication with a pronoun as predicate corresponds to ‘X is
mine/yours/his/hers’, etc. Unlike the English translation, the pronoun serving
as predicate in Pévé is from the set of indicative subject pronouns (see chap-
ter 6), not the set of possessive pronouns. The pronoun serving as predicate is
preceded by the relative marker mə̀. A clause-final marker, such as the imper-
sonal pronoun na, must be used to indicate that the sequence Subject mə̀ Pro-
noun clause is an independent clause (see section 2, above):(23) ya nãw kunə mə nambà na
     cow PL REL 1PL        I.PRO
     ‘those cows are ours’vs.(24) ya nãw kunə mə nambà
     cow PL REL 1PL
     ‘our cows there …’The equational predication with a pronoun as predicate is distinct from the
attributive clause, in which the pronoun modifies the subject (see section 4,
below). In the attributive clause, the modifying pronoun is from the possessive
set:(25) ya nãw man          na
     cow 1SG.POSS I.PRO
     ‘it/that is my cow’Cf. the equational predication, with an indicative subject pronoun:(26) yá nãw mə̀ na na
     cow REL 1SG I.PRO
     ‘the cow is mine’A clause-final marker, such as the negative mì or an added final vowel, can also
mark the end of the equational clause, rendering the phrase-final impersonal
pronoun na unnecessary:                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

4        Attributive PredicationThe attributive predication is a verbless clause of the form Noun/Pronoun
Modifier, where the modifier denotes an attribute of the subject noun or pro-
noun. Like other verbless predications, the attributive predication must end
with a clause-final marker, which may consist of an added final vowel (FV) or a
marker that is inherently clause-final. In the next example, the marker of com-
pleteness is the clause-final assertive marker sí (cf. chapter 9):(28) Sə́ráy jáŋ sí
     S.       tall ASSERT
     ‘Sə́ ráy is tall’Without the assertive marker, the construction cannot stand alone and there-
fore cannot act as an attributive predication:(29) Sə́ráy jáŋ
     S.       tall
     ‘tall Sə́ rá …’A phrase-final added vowel (see chapter 3) is sometimes the sole marker of
completeness of the predication:(30) ta bròʔ-o
     3F ugly-FV
     ‘she is ugly’(31) mum ɗáw sar-a
     3M one only-FV
     ‘he is alone’(32) ya ndaʔ                    rə    uraʔ-a
     mare (lit. ‘female horse’) DED.F black-FV
     ‘that mare is black’                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     mare (lit. ‘female horse’) DED.F black
     ‘that black mare …’An attributive predicate that is not an inherent modifier must be overtly
marked for the modifying function. For example, a noun that functions as a
modifier is preceded by the relative marker mə̀. The resulting construction is
not a relative clause (see chapter 17). The evidence for this is that the attribu-
tive predication, unlike the relative clause, can stand alone as an independent
clause:(34) ya nãw mə̀ ɓú
     cow REL whiteness
     ‘the cow is white’ (not ‘the cow that is white …’)The chief formal difference between the relative clause and an attributive
predication with a nominal predicate is the lack of a resumptive pronoun in
the attributive predication. With the resumptive pronoun ti, the construction
serves as a relative clause rather than an independent attributive clause. The
relative clause cannot function as an independent clause:(35) ya nãw mə̀ ti       ɓú
     cow REL PRO whiteness
     ‘the cow that is white …’The difference between the relative clause and the attributive predication is
further illustrated by the next example. The first instance of the form mə̀ marks
the verb phrase tà kə syem ‘walks on legs’ as an attribute of the subject kwá
‘thing’. There is no resumptive pronoun within the phrase, so the phrase is
attributive. The attributive phrase [kwá mə̀ tà kə syem] is itself the head of a
larger clause that is marked by the second instance of mə̀. The evidence that the
larger clause is a relative clause and not an attributive clause is that the marker
mə̀ in the larger clause is followed by the masculine resumptive pronoun ni. The
end of the relative clause is marked by the masculine post-relative marker nə̀
(chapter 17), which does not occur in the attributive clause. The lengthy relative
clause kwá … nə̀ in turn functions as the subject of a larger attributive predica-
tion whose predicate is kəlìŋ ‘rat’. The status of the sentence as an independent
identificational clause is marked by the clause-final impersonal pronoun na:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘the animal (‘thing walking on legs’) that we saw, it is a rat’As is the case in equational and identificational constructions, the attributive
clause with past or future time reference is marked by the copula kè. The copula
has high tone in reference to past time:(37) ta ké ɓáy kum               àmá        tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi
     3F COP pretty yesterday but (Ar.) today 3F NEG pretty still NEG
     ‘she was pretty yesterday, but she is not pretty today’Cf. the same notion with reference to the time of speech, where kè does not
occur:(38) ta ɓáy

     ‘she is pretty’(39) tsoɓ rum          ké ɓáyrúm-u

     ‘its price is high’In an attributive clause that refers to future time, the future marker də̀ precedes
the copula and the copula carries its underlying low tone:(41) tsoɓ rum də̀ kè ɓáyrúm

     ‘its price will be high’

corresponding to English ‘to have’ or its equivalent in other Indo-European lan-
guages. The possessive predication has the form Possessor kə Possessum (the
thing possessed), where kə is the associative preposition:(42) ta kə     sə̀lay-a
     3F ASSC money-FV
     ‘she has money’ (lit. ‘she (is) with money’)(43) ta tsú kə       sə̀lày mì
     3F NEG ASSC money NEG
     ‘she does not have money’The attribute ‘hot’ is also conveyed by a possessive construction:(44) fún           nə       kə      ku
     boule/food PROX ASSC heat, fire
     ‘this food is hot’ (lit. ‘with heat’)The inanimate subject does not have to be overtly marked in the clause, pro-
vided the subject is understood:(45) kə       ku
     ASSC heat, fire
     ‘(it) is hot’The resemblance between the copula kè and the associative preposition kə
might suggest a path of evolution from one function to the other, but this is
rendered unlikely by the fact that the two markers can be used together, each
retaining its own function:(46) namba ké kə́       sə̀lay-a

verbless and copular predications                                                 2056       ConclusionAn independent verbless clause must be marked as such by a clause-final added
vowel, the interrogative marker su, the assertive marker si, the clause-final
impersonal pronoun na, and perhaps other means of marking the end of a
clause. Verbless clauses are attested in the domains of identificational pred-
ication, equational predication, and attributive predication. The impersonal
pronoun na is used in such predications only if the clause in question refers
to a state or event that exists or takes place at the time of speech. If the clause
refers to a point in time before or after the time of speech, the clause is marked
instead by the copula kè. Like other verbs, the copula carries high tone in the
perfective function and is preceded by the marker də́ in the future tense func-
tion. The absence of the copula kè, the impersonal pronoun na, or some other
means of marking the end of a clause renders the verbless clause a dependent
phrase that cannot stand alone.","[214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221]"

"6.7     Modality
The domain of modality in Pévé can be divided into two major categories: sub-
junctive and indicative. An unusual feature of Pévé is the existence of a set of
subject pronouns used exclusively in subjunctive clauses: In many cases, the
form of the subject pronoun is the only means of marking a clause as subjunc-
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

an overt subject and/or the form of direct/indirect object pronoun(s) used in
the clause. Interestingly, direct/indirect object pronouns used in the subjunc-
tive mood are identical with those in the perfective set, as described above. This
set of object pronouns can thus be termed the perfective/subjunctive set, in
contrast with the non-perfective/non-subjunctive set. The verb in the subjunc-
tive clause carries its underlying tone and cannot be preceded by a tense/aspect
marker.
    The subjunctive mood is subdivided into several modalities, including obli-
gation, permission, and prohibition, each marked by one of a set of clause-final
or clause-initial particles. Unlike many languages, Pévé does not make a formal
distinction between the imperative mood, i.e. a command addressed to the sec-
ond person, and the subjunctive mood, which may express desire, possibility,
obligation, and other irrealis functions. While in some languages the absence
of a subject pronoun is a marker of the imperative mood, in Pévé the subject
pronoun can be used in or omitted from both imperative clauses and clauses
marked for other subdomains within the subjunctive mood.
    Modalities within the indicative mood include the speaker’s promise or
prediction, marked by the clause-final marker ɓo, and the assertive modality,
which conveys the speaker’s belief that an event or a state did occur, is occur-
ring, could occur, or will occur. The assertive modality is marked by the mor-
pheme si, which can occur in clause- or sentence-final position or immediately
before the clause-final interrogative marker su in a polar question. The marker
si cannot be used in a negative clause.
    Pévé has also grammaticalized the counterfactual modality, marked by the
postverbal marker kə̀zə́, as a means of indicating that the subject’s belief or
wish concerning the event was unrealized or cannot be realized. Caron 2015
describes a similar function in two West Chadic languages, namely Hausa,
where the counterfactual is marked by the clause-initial conjunction dà, and
Zaar, where the counterfactual is marked by the conjunction jâːn or the con-
junction dà:, borrowed from Hausa.","[31, 32]"

         chapter 9Mood and Modality1        IntroductionThis chapter describes forms and functions in the domains of deontic and epis-
temic modality in Pévé. In most grammatical descriptions, deontic modality is
taken to include the imperative mood, typically described as commands to the
second person, and the subjunctive mood, typically described as expressing
desire, possibility, obligation, and other irrealis propositions. Unlike many lan-
guages, Pévé does not make a formal distinction between the imperative mood
and the subjunctive mood. Coding means such as the presence or absence of
an overt subject marker and the use of a dedicated set of subject pronouns
differentiate subjunctive clauses from indicative clauses in Pévé but do not dif-
ferentiate commands from other functions in the deontic mood. For simplicity,
the term ‘subjunctive (mood)’ is used to refer to commands to the second per-
son as well as clauses expressing permission, obligation, expectation, etc. with
respect to any person, from the speaker’s perspective.
   Means of coding the subjunctive mood include the choice of subject pro-
noun, the absence of an overt subject, and the use of object pronouns from
the perfective/subjunctive set. Subcategories within the subjunctive, such as
permission, obligation, and others, are marked by clause-final or clause-initial
particles (see below). The verb in the subjunctive mood is unmarked in that it
carries its underlying tone and is not preceded by a tense or aspect marker.
   The primary difference between epistemic modality and the subjunctive
mood, as described in this chapter, is that pronouns used in the epistemic
modality are from the indicative set, not the subjunctive set, and that markers
of epistemic modality may co-occur with various markers of tense or aspect.
The subjunctive mood, in contrast, uses only pronouns from the subjunctive
set (chapter 6) and can co-occur only with the unmarked tense/aspect. The
present chapter begins with a description of the subjunctive mood and a num-
ber of subdomains within the subjunctive mood, functions of which include
the speaker’s prohibition of an event, the speaker’s statement of obligation
concerning an event, and the speaker’s statement of permission concerning an
event. The latter part of the chapter describes two subdomains within the epis-
temic mood, referred to tentatively as ‘promise mood’ and ‘assertive mood’. The
promise mood, as used in the present work, conveys the speaker’s certainty that
a future event will take place. The assertive mood, as used in this work, conveys

is occurring or will occur (see Palmer 2001 for discussion of the assertive func-
tion). The function of the assertive marker in Pévé, marked by the clause-final
morpheme si (glossed ‘ASSERT’), resembles the function of certain markers in
other languages, such as lè in Giziga (Shay 2012, ms.), za in Mina (Frajzyngier
and Johnston with Edwards 2005), and náx in Kapsiki (Smith 1969). Whether
the function of si in Pévé directly corresponds with the functions of markers
in other languages remains an open question. Other subdomains within the
domain of epistemic modality are described separately in chapter 18 (condi-
tional and temporal constructions) and chapter 19 (complementation).","[172, 173, 174]"

The language distinguishes between the labio-velar glide /w/ and the palatal
glide /y/ in word-initial position:/w/     wa ‘head’ (N); we ‘to see’
/y/     ya ‘mother’; ye (marker of permission)In word-final position, the glides /w/ and /y/ contrast with one another and
with word-final vowels. The final palatal glide is attested only after the low
vowel /a/, while the final labiovelar glide is attested after /a/ and the front vow-
els /i/ and /e/:ɓay     ‘and’ (conjunction) vs. ɓá ‘hand’ (noun)
yaw     ‘miracle’ vs. ya ‘mother’
ɬew     ‘meat’ vs. ɬé ‘take’
síw     ‘tomorrow’ vs. si (assertive marker)The evidence that the final glide is consonantal is provided by examining pars-
ing morphology (see Frajzyngier 2016b) in Pévé. Parsing morphology, described
in detail in chapter 3, involves a phrase-final marker whose function is to
tell the listener that the preceding phrase is complete. Parsing morphology
in Pévé involves adding a final vowel to a morpheme whose underlying form
is consonant-final. The added final vowel, glossed ‘FV’, is a copy of the vowel
that precedes the underlying final consonant. The adverbial corresponding to
‘today’ has the form tám in isolation or phrase-internal position and the form
tám-a in phrase-final position:(6) mum tá lúmò kə          sə́ tám-a
    3M go market ASSC 3F.O today-FV
    ‘he went to the market with her today’A phrase-final vowel cannot be added to a morpheme whose underlying form
ends in a vowel. This provides a tool for determining whether the final vowel of
the morpheme is underlying or not:(7) Gwà tá lúmò kúm            kə́dàn tsoɓ keve-*e

an underlying consonant and not a part of a diphthong. The added vowel is a
copy of the vowel preceding the glide:(8) mum ne ʒyè         ɗáw-a

Pévé distinguishes between the lateral /l/ and the rhotic /r/, realized as a short
trill:/l/     làʔ ‘say’; lúmò ‘market’ (Ful.)
/r/     raʔ ‘gather (things)’; rìn 1SG possessive pronoun; rù 2M possessive pro-
        noun; ri ‘time, space’2.11    Lateral Fricatives: ɬ, ɮ
The voiceless lateral fricative /ɬ/ contrasts with the voiced lateral fricative /ɮ/
and with the lateral liquid /l/. All three occur in word-initial position:/ɬ/     ɬé ‘to take’; ɬew or ɬyew ‘meat’
/ɮ/     ɮe ‘to start, to pass’; ɮaʔ ‘to dance’
/l/     làʔ ‘say’Both /l/ and /ɬ/ are attested in word-final position:/ɬ/     vaɬ ‘five’
/l/     kwol ‘wash’
3       VowelsThe vowels in Table 4 are phonemic in Pévé (the symbol / /̃ indicates a nasalized
vowel).
  While oral vowels occur in open and closed syllables, nasalized vowels occur
only in open syllables or before a glottal stop. The lax vowels /ɪ, ɛ, ɔ, ʊ/ occur
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

sponding tense vowels /i, e, o, u/. The high central vowel, transcribed as /ə/ in
accordance with Chadic linguistic tradition, is very frequent but is not phone-
mic, as shown below.13.1    Oral Vowels
Evidence that the five oral vowels are phonemic is provided by minimal or near-
minimal pairs in open syllables:/i/       gi ‘to do, to make’; ki ‘back (side)’; yii ‘squirrel’
/e/       ge ‘to throw (at a target)’ kè (copula); ye (modal particle)
/a/       gaʔ ‘side’; ka ‘where’ (question word); ya ‘female’
/o/       noʔ ‘near’; sò ‘bone’; pocʔ ‘to pay’
/u/       gú ‘tree, wood’, ku ‘fire’; su (interrogative particle)All of the vowels above are contrastive in closed syllables as well:/i/       ʃin ‘work’
/e/       ʃyèn ‘to sleep’
/a/       ndzar ‘sister’
/o/       tsoɓ ‘purchase’ (N)
/u/       ndzur ‘cousin’There is a phonetic alternation between the tense vowels /i, e, o, u/ in open
syllables and the lax vowels /ɪ, ɛ, ɔ, ʊ/ in closed syllables. Because lax vowels do
not appear in any instance to be phonemic, any lax vowels in transcriptions are
surface manifestations of underlying tense vowels.","[52, 53, 54, 55]"

Pévé has a unique pronoun form ndi that is used solely to represent the object of
the associative preposition kə. The object of the preposition is a singular third-
person entity, animate or inanimate, that has been previously mentioned or
whose reference can be deduced by the listener. The form ndi, glossed OP for
‘object of a preposition’, is not a member of any known pronoun set in Pévé and
is not attested with any prepositions other than kə:(46) na faŋ       Garoua kə      ndi
     1SG return Garoua PREP OP
     ‘I returned to Garoua with it.’Cf. a similar construction in which the object of the preposition is represented
by a noun:(47) Taú fól        sə́ kə       àtsíw

     1SG.POSS-FV
     ‘the man who brought me here (lit. ‘took me to come here with him’) is

pronoun referring to a human entity:(51) àwo na mbə́ kə          sə/rum      si
     yes 1SG come ASSC 3F.O/3M.O ASSERT
     ‘yes, I brought (‘came with’) her/him’The phrase kə ndi can be used in a clause describing possession of a previously
mentioned inanimate object (recall that Pévé does not have a verb correspond-
ing to ‘to have, to own’):(52) ta kə       ndi
     3F ASSC OP
     ‘she has it’ (lit. ‘she (is) with it’)The function of the phrase kə ndi is not limited to previous mention, as shown
by the following example:(53) ta gí tsoɓ hu ɓay ta tsóɓ mbraw kə                ndi
     3F sell     goat CONJ 3F buy clothing ASSC OP
     ‘she sold a goat and bought clothing with it (the money from the sale)’There appears to be no plural form corresponding to ndi. Instead, the plural
object of kə is marked by a plural pronoun from the perfective/subjunctive
object pronoun set described in chapter 6:(54) yii       ɮé kə      ʒi gày kə         nday
     squirrel start ASSC play gàyʔ ASSC 3PL.O
     ‘Squirrel immediately started to play gàyʔ with them.’The fact that the inanimate object of the preposition kə must be overtly coded
even though the inanimate object of a verb is usually unmarked (see inanimate
previous reference, above) is explained by the fact that a preposition cannot
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

in Pévé remains to be explained, as it does not resemble any other third-person
pronoun forms in the language. The pronoun ndi bears some resemblance the
pronoun dì in Giziga (Central Chadic; Shay 2012, ms.), whose function is to indi-
cate the presence of an additional third-person argument without specifying
the syntactic or semantic function of the argument.","[232, 233, 234, 235]"
"
6       Outline of the Grammar6.1       Phonology
The phonology of Pévé resembles that of many other Chadic languages in hav-
ing a rich consonant system. In Pévé, the system includes glottalized and labi-
alized stops, palatalized and non-palatalized fricatives, lateral fricatives, glottal
stops, a number of continuants, and syllable-initial consonant clusters. Pévé
has the phonemic vowels /i, e, a, o, u, ə/, where ə represents a high-central
vowel. The nasalized vowels /ĩ, ẽ, ã, õ, and ũ/ also occur in surface forms. The
question of the phonemic vs. phonetic nature of nasalized vowels is discussed
in chapter 2.
    Syllables in Pévé may have the form V, CV, VC, CVC, CCV, CCVC, CCCVC.
An interesting feature of Pévé is that the majority of lexical items in the data
are monosyllabic. Among the few polysyllabic lexical items in the data, most
are obviously derived through compounding or other morphological means
(see below), suggesting that the derivation of the polysyllabic forms is relatively
recent.
    Pévé has three tones, high, mid, and low, which carry functions in the do-
mains of both lexicon and grammar. In some cases a lexical distinction is coded
solely by tone. The primary function of tone in the grammatical system is the
coding of perfective aspect by means of relative high tone on the verb. In all
tenses and aspects other than the perfective, the verb has its underlying tone,
i.e., the tone that is used in the isolated or citation form. In the description
below, this form is referred to as the unmarked or non-perfective form of the
verb. As shown in chapters 8–10, temporal, aspectual and modal categories
other than the perfective are coded by preverbal markers and by the choice of
subject and non-subject pronouns. The use of non-subject pronouns to mark
functions that are typically associated with verbal markers is an unusual char-
acteristic of the Pévé language.",[28]

2        Existing ApproachesThe alternation between a given morpheme with a final vowel and the same
morpheme without a final vowel has been subject to a variety of analyses in
Chadic linguistic literature. Most analyses (Barreteau and Le Bléis 1990, New-
man 2000, Frajzyngier with Shay 2002, Newman and Vanheuven 1981, and oth-
ers) view the contrast as being between a prepausal form, which has a final
vowel (in some cases a long vowel), and a non-prepausal or sentence-internal
form, which does not have a final vowel. In most such studies it is assumed
that the final vowel is underlying and that it is deleted in non-prepausal posi-
tion.
   Analyses based on the prepausal/non-prepausal contrast do not account for
contrasts of the type found in Pévé. In both of the following sentences the first-
person singular pronoun is phrase-final, yet one form has a final vowel and one

parsing morphology                                                               55does not. Either form can be followed by a pause. Phrase-internal vowel dele-
tion cannot be a factor, as the isolated 1SG pronoun has the form nàn rather
than *nàna:(1) ta gí    kwáti ne nàn-a
    3F make food ADP 1SG.O-FV
    ‘she made me some food’ (FV: final vowel)vs.(2) ta gí    kwáti ne nàn
    3F make food ADP 1SG.O
    ‘she made me some food’The question, therefore, is why a given morpheme has a final vowel in certain
utterances and not in others. As shown below, the distinction in Pévé between
the vowel-final form and the form without a final vowel occurs with lexical and
grammatical morphemes of many different categories.
   In Pévé, the contrast between the phrase-final added vowel and the absence
of an added vowel resembles, to some extent, the contrast between final vowel
addition and final vowel deletion in Wandala (Central Chadic). Frajzyngier
2016b describes the function of the two forms in Wandala, termed ‘parsing mor-
phology’, as follows:      While neither of the forms indicates any specific semantic relation, they
      both enable the listener to parse the sentence into units that can undergo
      further analysis and allow for inferences about a large number of seman-
      tic relations within the clause and within the sentence.
           Frajzyngier 2016b: 1While the concept of parsing morphology broadly applies to the alternation
between phrase-internal and phrase-final forms in Pévé, the function of pars-
ing morphology in Pévé differs from the forms and functions in Wandala, as
shown below. The following sections describe the form and distribution of
phrase-final vowels in Pévé and the functions of phrase-internal and phrase-
final forms.","[70, 71]"

2        Indicative ClausesIn most instances, negation of the indicative clause is coded by the negative
marker tsú immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the negative
marker mì at the end of the clause. Following are examples in various aspects
and tenses:Perfective aspect:(1) Taú tsú tá lúmò tám kə              bə̀kà  mì
    T. NEG go market today ASSC morning NEG
    ‘Tau didn’t go to the market this morning’Cf. the affirmative perfective:(2) Taú tá lúmò tám kə            bə̀kà

    3F sell     beer day market
    ‘she sells beer on the day of the market’The non-existence of an entity can be coded through negation of the affirma-
tive clause:(5) mòta       tsú gàk tsuwal ɗáw mi
    car (Ful.) NEG can cross one NEG
    ‘No car could cross it.’ (or ‘Not one car could cross it’)(6) mum ti ɬew ɓay mum tsú ár                 kam kwá məsin mi
    3M eat meat CONJ 3M NEG leave rest                other NEG
    ‘he ate the meat and did not leave any behind’The same variations in constituent order that occur in affirmative clauses also
occur in negative clauses. For example, in the future tense there is an alterna-
tion between the form S Tense/Aspect V O IO ne and the form S Tense/Aspect
IO V O (see chapter 8). Either form can be negated by the same means, namely
post-subject tsú and clause-final mì:S NEG Tense/Aspect V O IO ne NEG:(7) na tsú də̀ gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn          ùm ne mì

     ‘she has money’Neither of the negative markers tsú or mì can be omitted when the negative
clause is used in isolation, and most negative clauses in natural discourse also
use both negative markers. However, tsú can be omitted in a negative clause
that is a response to a question:(13) Taú (tsú) tá lúmò mì
     T. NEG go market NEG
     ‘Tau didn’t go to the market’ (in response to ‘Did he go to the market?’)As shown in chapter 9, the marker tsú is also not used in the prohibitive
clause:(14) à         ɗak ku nayʔ     mi

the analysis that si codes the assertive mood, i.e. the speaker’s desire that the
hearer believe in the occurrence of an event (see chapter 9):(17) handày tsú tsóɓ ya nãw mì *si

context and intonation:(20) ha tsú táʔ l’école dimanche nə       zaʔ mi
     2M NEG go to school Sunday DED.M more NEG
     ‘you no longer go to Sunday school?’The negated clause can also be followed by the interrogative marker su. Note
that the following clause also involves the permissive modality marker ye (see
chapter 9), evidence that modality is a distinct domain:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ing)
3       Scope of NegationElicited examples suggest that the scope of negation in Pévé is the entire propo-
sition rather than an entity involved in the proposition. Attempts to elicit sen-
tences in which one referent with a given grammatical role is negated while
another referent with the same grammatical role is not negated resulted in sep-
arate clauses: a negative clause and an affirmative clause. Following is a Pévé
translation of the English construction ‘he bought a cow, not a goat’:(22) mum tsóɓ ya nãw àmá          mum tsú tsóɓ hu mì
     3M buy cow but (Ar.) 3M NEG buy goat NEG
     ‘he bought a cow, but he did not buy a goat’Translation of the English ‘he doesn’t buy mine, only yours’ also results in two
separate clauses:(23) mum tsú tsoɓ mə na kpe mì ama                      mum tsoɓ mə
     3M NEG buy PREP 1SG never NEG but (Ar.) 3M buy PREP
     ha taw sar-a
     2M only-FV
     ‘he never buys (what is) mine; he only buys (what is) yours’
4       ConclusionMost negative clauses involve the marker tsú after the subject noun or pronoun
and the marker mì at the end of the clause. The negative marker tsú can be omit-
ted in a prohibitive clause or in a negative clause that is a response to a question.
Tense and aspect are coded in the negative clause as they are in the affirmative
clause. The scope of negation is the entire clause, not a single constituent.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256]"
"6.4       Possessive Pronouns
Pévé has two distinct sets of possessive pronouns. In keeping with Chadic lin-
guistic tradition, these sets are labeled ‘alienable’ vs. ‘inalienable’. It should
be noted, however, that the class to which a given lexical item belongs is a
language-specific question and is not based on the nature of the real-world ref-
erent.
    Table 5 shows the two sets of possessive pronouns. Note that wherever there
is a distinction between the inalienable and the alienable possessive pronoun,
the inalienable pronoun begins with the consonant /r/. This is true even when
the inalienable pronoun is not obviously derived from the alienable form. The
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

3PL   ndày                             ndày
presence of the initial /r/ thus suggests traces of an earlier pre-pronominal
marker whose function was to indicate inalienable possession. Interestingly,
pronouns from the inalienable possessive set also serve as objects of prepo-
sitions, while pronouns from the alienable possessive set are identical with
object pronouns from the unmarked (‘non-perfective’) set (see chapter 6).
    The category of inalienable possession includes body-part terms and certain
lexical items corresponding to family relations, including ‘wife’, ‘brother’, and
‘sister’:(54) hum/i rìn
     ear/eye 1SG.POSS
     ‘my ear(s)/eye(s)’(55) ɓá rum
     hand 3M.POSS
     ‘his hand(s)’(56) ma rù

     hand 2PL.POSS
     ‘your (2PL) hands’In the next example the inalienable possessive pronoun modifies the noun
syem ‘time, occurrence’. A possible explanation for this is that the form syem
also denotes the body part ‘foot’, which may well be the source of the abstract
noun syem:(59) syem híndʒiʔ rùm   n-a
     time three 3M.POSS DED.M-FV
     ‘the third time’The much broader category of alienable possession includes nouns denoting
other family relationships, including ‘child’, ‘mother’, ‘father’, and ‘husband’;
nouns corresponding to ‘friend’, ‘house’, and ‘home’; nouns with non-human
animate referents; and nouns with inanimate referents:(60) ya/ba/ndʒí             màn
     mother/father/husband 1SG.POSS

     house/name/cow/story 2M.POSS
     ‘your (m.) house/name/cow/story’Pévé speakers without formal education tend to use the alienable form, rather
than the inalienable form, with nouns corresponding to ‘wife’, ‘brother’, and
‘sister’:(64) ma wũ (not rù)
     wife 2M.POSS
     for ‘your wife’                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     sister 1SG.POSS
     for ‘my sister’Possession of the noun tú ‘body’ can be marked by an alienable or inalienable
possessive pronoun, with no apparent difference in meaning:(66) tu man             titi

     3M show body 3M.POSS PREP 1SG.O
     ‘he showed himself (‘his body’) to me’ (inalienable)In some cases the choice between inalienable and alienable possessor indicates
a referential distinction. In this example, the alienable possessive pronoun
refers to the person who named the price:(69) tsoɓ màn (alienable)
     price 1SG.POSS
     ‘my price’ (for my merchandise)In the next example, use of the inalienable possessive pronoun codes reference
to the price itself:(70) tsoɓ rùm (inalienable)
     price 3M.POSS
     ‘its (lit. ‘his’) price’Again, the function of the inalienable possessive pronoun vs. the alienable
possessive pronoun depends in part on shared information and surrounding
discourse.","[106, 107, 108, 109]"

The distal counterparts of the proximal demonstratives ti and ni are dáyʔ (fem.)
and náyʔ (masc., pl.). As is the case in proximal spatial deixis, the gender of the
demonstrative reflects that of the entity whose location is referred to:(73) ya naw mə dáyʔ rə́               mə mum na
     cow REL DIST.F POST REL 3SG.M I.PRO
     ‘that cow is his’ (lit. ‘the cow that is over there is his’)Like the demonstratives ti and ni, dáyʔ and náyʔ can function as arguments in
verbless clauses of the form ‘who/what (is) DEM’:(74) mi náyʔ         su
     what DIST.M Q
     ‘what is that?’(75) sa kuni náyʔ    su

     ‘who are they?’(76) ma       sa dáyʔ su
     woman 3F DIST.F Q
     ‘who is that woman over there?’In contrast with proximal deixis, where the feminine demonstrative is the
default form, it appears that the masculine demonstrative is the default form
for marking distal spatial deixis. The following sentence from natural discourse
answers a question about arithmetic, which has no inherent gender:(77) náyʔ    gí    gu kánki wá ɗáw … wá hóɓ sar ye

     kadi

The spatial deictic demonstratives ti, ni, dáyʔ, and náyʔ also function as deter-
miners in the domain of entity deixis. In this function, the determiner indicates
whether a noun refers to an entity near to or distant from the place of speech.
Like the spatial deictic demonstratives in section 6.1, the deictic determiners
distinguish between proximal and distal deixis. Again, the default gender for
proximal deixis appears to be feminine. In the following example, the form ti
(fem.) indicates that the preceding noun dapà gaʔ ‘(river) bank’ refers to an
entity that is near the place of speech, while the form dáyʔ (fem.) indicates
that the entity represented by dapà gaʔ is distant from the place of speech:(78) mota        nyén dapà gaʔ tʃiɓáyrúm               ɓaĩyén        dàpà gaʔ …

place of speech:(79) swə ni          nə púm num-u

     ‘this man, he hit him’The form náyʔ as a determiner refers to a masculine entity that is distant from

The masculine proximal marker ni can also be used to mark the proximity of
a point in time with respect to the time of speech. In phrase-final position the
marker ni is followed by na, whose function is to mark the end of a verbless
clause (see chapter 11):(82) ì           də ɗe num kə             fə̀tà ni      na

7       ConclusionThe rich system of reference in Pévé includes the first mention of an entity,
as indicated by use of a bare noun phrase; feminine, masculine, and plural
determiners that instruct the listener to deduce the referent of the noun using
any available means; and various means of narrowing the scope of reference,
including anaphoric reference to an entity, a location, a point in time, an event,
or the manner of a preceding or ongoing event; previous mention; and proxi-
mal vs. distal deictic reference to an entity, location, or point in time. In all
domains apart from first mention, plurality of the head noun is marked by the
phrase-final marker kunə. The plural marker cannot be used in first mention of
an entity. Some forms in the domain of reference have an interesting interac-
tion with other domains. For example, because the default marker of proximal
location is the feminine determiner ti, use of the masculine demonstrative ni
in referring to a proximal location places the location in focus. Similarly, a pre-

"2.3.2       The Verb in ‘to Say, to Speak’
In natural discourse and in elicited examples involving the matrix verb in ‘to
speak, to say’, the direct-speech complement of in is sometimes marked by the
complementizer na:(28) ɛɛ … brùku          [corr: dzə̀nàk] gòwàʔ in ùm ne na (pause)

whether or not the main verb and complement share the same subject:(30) Kói ín i           mum kəí kávà ùm-ù

     ‘he asked me if I knew the Pévé language’In summary, while the complementizer i after the matrix-clause verb corre-
sponding to ‘ask’ or ‘answer’ appears to mark the difference between comple-
ments involving direct vs. indirect speech, this distinction is not marked in
complements of verbs corresponding to ‘say’, ‘tell’ and ‘speak’. Such comple-
ments may be marked by the complementizer i, the impersonal pronoun na,
or the combined complementizer i na, with no apparent functional difference.
It is likely that the presence or absence of a complementizer relies in part on
the speaker’s choice, much like the complementizer in English sentences such
as ‘He said (that) he broke his hoe’.","[291, 292, 293]"
"2.2.2      Speaker’s Obligation: sáyʔ
The clause-initial particle sáyʔ codes the speaker’s sense of his or her own
obligation. The first-person subject can be represented by a pronoun from the
indicative or the subjunctive set:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     2M.SBJV come already-FV
     ‘come here (so I can punish you)!’ (cf. ‘get over here already!’ in English)2.2.3      Permission: ye
The particle ye, like the particle riʔ, occurs only in phrase-final position. The
two particles cannot co-occur in the same clause. The particle ye is glossed
‘PERM’ for ‘permission’. With a second-person subject, ye conveys the speaker’s
permission to perform an act and can also be interpreted as a polite or formal
command:(32) à          zye ye
     2M.SBJV enter PERM
     ‘go on in/it’s okay to go in!’(33) à          pum nùm ye

     ‘hit him and then catch him!’Clauses ending in ye are not limited to the second-person addressee. Use of
ye with a first-person plural subject indicates the speaker’s suggestion or the
speaker’s desire, both of which imply the speaker’s sense of permission:(38) mə́ tà ye
     1PL go PERM
     ‘let’s walk’In a clause with a third-person subject, the marker yé conveys the speaker’s
permission, wishes or suggestions with respect to the subject:(39) nə̀ mbə̀ yé
     3M come PERM
     ‘may he come/let him come’(40) nə̀/tə̀ ʔyá yé
     3M/3F leave PERM
     ‘he/she should leave’The marker ye can occur in an interrogative clause, where it marks a request
for permission or a question about obligation. Note the use of the subjunctive
subject pronoun as well:(41) á         ɬe ɗérwa ye       su
     1SG.SBJV take book PERM Q
     ‘may I borrow this (book)?’(42) á         tà ye          su

verb wàʔ ‘to want’ (see chapter 19 for complements of volitional verbs):(43) na wàʔ ʔyá ye
     1SG want leave PERM
     ‘I would like to leave’2.2.4       Prohibitive: mì
A prohibitive clause, the negative counterpart of the imperative or subjunctive
clause, is marked by the clause-final negative marker mì. While most indica-
tive negative clauses involve two negative markers, the clause-final mì and the
clause-internal negative tsú (see chapter 14), the prohibitive clause does not
involve the clause-internal marker tsú. Pronouns used in the prohibitive clause
are from the same set as those used in the subjunctive or imperative clause (see
Table 12, above):(44) à          də̀ han mì
     2M.SBJV go there NEG
     ‘don’t go there!’(45) à         tsoɓ mbraw ne nàn ɗáw mì

     3M leave NEG
     ‘may he not leave/don’t let him leave’The markers ye (permission), riʔ (obligation) or sáyʔ (speaker’s obligation) can-
not be used in the prohibitive clause. This provides evidence that permission,
obligation, and prohibition are all subdomains within the domain of the sub-
junctive mood:(47) à          tsoɓ mbraw ne nàn ɗáw mi *ye/*riʔ/*sáyʔ

of the epistemic mood, which pertain to the speaker’s degree of belief in the
truth or likelihood of an event. The speaker’s attitude toward the truth of a
statement or the likelihood of a state or event can be expressed by a num-
ber of means, including verbs of saying, verbs of volition, verbs of cognition,
and conditional constructions, all of which are discussed in other chapters.
The discussion here is limited to the clause-final particle ɓo, which codes the
speaker’s reassurance or promise that an event will occur (promise mood), and
the clause-final particle si, which advises the hearer to believe in the occur-
rence of a past, current or future event or state (assertive mood). The evidence
that ɓo and si are both markers of mood is that they cannot co-occur with each
other or with any other markers of mood. The evidence that ɓo and si belong to
a modal domain distinct from that of the subjunctive mood is that all attested
clauses with ɓo or si involve subjects from the indicative set, not the subjunc-
tive set.","[180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"

Focus on the subject is marked by the marker kə followed by the relative marker
mə and a resumptive pronoun coding the gender of the head. The difference
between the focus clause and the relative clause lies in the marker kə́ after the
focused subject. The source of the marker kə́ is an open question, as the form
bears similarity to both the copula kè and the associative preposition kə:(10) mum kə́ mə̀ ni tsóɓ ya nãw àmá na tsú mì

lowing the proper noun:(13) ɓay Taobay nə           gàʔ gazù
     ɓay Taobay nə           gaʔ ka   su

     ‘“So where is this Taobay?”’3.2     Focus on the Object
As shown in chapter 6, a previously mentioned inanimate object is usually not
overtly marked. When an object pronoun is used to refer an inanimate argu-
ment, this places the argument in focus:(14) na ti sə́/nùm        kúm-ú
     1SG ate 3F.O/3M.O yesterday-FV
     ‘I ate it yesterday’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     1SG bought yesterday
     ‘I bought (it) yesterday’In some examples focus on the object is coded by the juxtaposition of an affir-
mative and a negative clause pertaining to the same event, where each clause
has a different overt object. The following sentence is a Pévé translation of the
English form ‘he bought a cow, not a goat’:(17) mum tsóɓ ya nãw (pause) mum tsú tsóɓ ya hu mí
     3M buy cow                 3M NEG buy fem. goat NEG
     ‘he bought a cow; he did not buy a female goat’3.3     Focus on the Adjunct
In the next three examples, focus on the temporal adjunct (see chapter 21) is
marked by the clause-final impersonal pronoun na, which indicates that the
adjunct is an independent equational clause (cf. chapter 11). The marker ni
codes proximity to the time of speech. The English translation is intended to
convey the meaning, though it may not reflect the order of constituents in Pévé:(18) mgbaŋ ni         na    ì           də̀ ɗe nùm ye

tion of focus:

4       ConclusionA non-subject constituent is topicalized by fronting. The role of the topical-
ized constituent as the inanimate direct object of the comment clause is not
overtly marked within the clause. When the fronted non-subject argument is
not the direct object of the comment clause, the argument is marked by the
phrase dàn Noun DED, where DED is a deducible reference marker indicating
the gender of the head (i.e. topicalized) noun. The topicalized subject of a ver-
bal clause may be marked as the head of a relative clause, with the grammatical
role of the topicalized subject indicated by a resumptive pronoun within the
comment clause. Another means of indicating topicalization is a pause after
the topicalized constituent.
   Pévé does not distinguish between contrastive and non-contrastive focus.
Means of coding focus include the preposition kə followed by the relative
marker mə and a resumptive pronoun referring to the focused constituent;
overt marking of a constituent that is normally understood, such as the pre-
viously mentioned inanimate direct object; and the impersonal pronoun na,
which places the constituent in focus by marking it as an independent clause.","[259, 260, 261, 262]"

2       SubjectThe subject is defined here as the sole argument of an intransitive verb or the
controlling argument of a transitive verb. The defining features of the subject
argument in Pévé are as follows: (1) the subject noun or pronoun always pre-
cedes the verb, although other material may intervene between subject and
verb, and (2) the pronominal subject is represented by a member of a unique
set of pronouns that code a distinction between pronouns used in indica-
tive clauses and pronouns used in subjunctive clauses. Both subject pronoun
sets are distinct from the pronouns that represent direct and indirect objects.
Nearly every clause has a subject noun or pronoun. Exceptions to this rule
are some imperative clauses (commands addressed to the second person) and
some clauses in which the subject referent is a known entity (see chapter 12).
   The grammatical relation ‘subject’ does not imply a particular semantic rela-
tionship. The subject may be controlling or non-controlling, animate or inani-
mate, without further marking:(1) dʒwə fáŋ        ʔya    ɮé
    chief repeat depart pass
    ‘the chief left again’(2) ndʒɪn màn           ɮɛ́ si

verb, much material may occur between the subject noun or pronoun and the
verb. This material includes independent markers of tense, aspect or negation:(4) ta də̀ də̀ lúmò
    3F FUT go market
    ‘she will go to the market’(5) ta wə́      də̀ lúmò

    ‘then the chief asked him’(8) ɓay na ni          fáŋ mbə́

    2F COND made food finish ASSERT 1PL               FUT eat
    ‘if you have finished cooking, we will eat’In some tenses and aspects, as described in sections 3 and 4 below, the sub-
ject noun or pronoun can be separated from the verb by a noun or pronoun
representing another argument:(10) na də̀ ùm gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn-à

the negative marker, the future-tense marker, and a pronoun representing the
recipient of the event:(11) na tsú də̀ ùm gì tsòɓ ya naw màn ne mì
     1SG NEG FUT 3M.O sell         cow 1POSS ADP NEG

     3M NEG FUT 3F.O buy ADP NEG
     ‘he will not buy (it) for her’The pronoun representing the direct object can also occur between the subject
and the verb:(13) mum tsú də̀ um/sə́            tsoɓ síw mì
     3M NEG FUT 3M.O/3F.O buy tomorrow NEG
     ‘he will not buy it tomorrow’The fact that many lexical and grammatical items can occur between the sub-
ject and the verb raises the question of whether the position before the verb
is the coding means for the subject or whether sentence-initial position is the
coding means for the subject. However, the subject does not have to be the first

before the verb, though not necessarily in sentence-initial position. When more
than one argument precedes the verb (see sections 3.2 and 4.2), the subject is
the first of those arguments.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"

4       Reference to an Unspecified EntityAn unspecified entity differs from a deducible entity in that the unspecified
entity may or may not be known to the speaker or listener. Reference to an
unspecified entity does not instruct the listener to deduce the referent, since
the referent may not be deducible.
   Reference to an unspecified human entity can be indicated by the nouns

5       Anaphoric ReferenceAnaphoric reference indicates that the referent has been previously mentioned
in discourse. The referent in question may be an entity, a location, an event, a
manner, a speech act, or a point in time. As shown in section 3, a previously
mentioned entity does not have to be overtly marked as previously mentioned,
and there appears to be no marker whose sole function is to indicate previous
reference. Pronouns, however, do play a role in previous mention, as shown
below. When an entity is represented by a pronoun, a distinction is drawn
between animate previous reference and inanimate previous reference. The
previously mentioned object of a preposition, whether animate or inanimate,
is marked by the unique form ndí, described in section 5.2, below.","[228, 229, 230]"

"2.1       Marking the Addressee
The means of marking the addressee of a verb of saying depends on two fac-
tors: (a) whether the addressee is represented by a noun or by a pronoun, and
(b) whether the verb is a simple verb or a compound verb consisting of a verb
followed by a noun.
    The pronominal addressee of a simple verb is marked in the same way as
an indirect object pronoun with the semantic role of beneficiary, recipient, or
malefactive (cf. chapter 7). As is the case in simple clauses involving an indirect
object, the choice of pronoun and the presence of the adposition ne depend on
the tense and aspect of the main clause. In a perfective clause with an inher-
ent verb of saying, the pronominal addressee is marked by an object from the
perfective set, preceded by the adposition ne:(1) na ín ne nù
    1SG say ADP 2M.O
    ‘I spoke to you’(2) ta ín ne nùm tə́              ʔyá yé
    3F say ADP 3M.O 3F.SBJV leave PERM
    ‘she1 told him she2 should leave’The nominal addressee, like the nominal indirect object in other types of pred-
ications (see chapters 6, 7), is marked by the associative preposition kə after the
adposition ne:(3) mum láʔ ne kə́         brùk             na      mum gewa mbə̀
    3M say ADP ASSC monitor lizard-FV I.PRO 3M come back
    sədayʔ
    two days later
    ‘He told Monitor Lizard he should come back in two days.’The addressee of a compound verb is marked differently from the addressee
of a simple verb. The verbs tʃí vun ‘to ask’ and ɗam vun ‘to answer’ are com-
pounds consisting of a verb followed by the noun vun ‘mouth’. The pronom-
                                                                         Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

pronoun rather than an object pronoun, probably because the nominal con-
stituent of some compound verbs is a body-part noun. The possessive pronoun
immediately follows the noun:(4) mum tsí vun rìn          i        na wé   vun Pévé sí sú?

    ‘He answered him, “It wasn’t mine!”’2.2      Coreferentiality vs. Non-coreferentiality
As shown in Frajzyngier 1996, some Chadic languages differentiate between
coreferentiality and non-coreferentiality (also called disjoint reference) with
respect to (a) the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the comple-
ment clause, and (b) the addressee of the matrix clause and the subject of the
complement clause. Pévé has a grammatical means of indicating whether or
not the subject of the matrix clause is coreferential with the subject of the
complement clause. As shown below, this applies only when the complement
clause is in the subjunctive mood.
   When the pronominal subject of the matrix clause and the pronominal sub-
ject of the indicative complement clause have the same values for person, gen-
der, and number, the same pronoun form can be used to mark the subject in
both clauses. Coreferentiality or lack of coreferentiality with respect to the two
subject pronouns depends on context:(6) mum láʔ i             mum dʒwa
    3M said COMP 3M chief
    ‘he1 said that he1/2 is chief’(7) tá ín í            tá kəí kávà sá-a

    ‘she1 said she1/2 broke her hoe’There is also no means of marking coreferentiality or non-coreferentiality
when the subject of the matrix clause is a noun and the subject of the indicative
complement is a pronoun:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

    K. say COMP 3M hunter I.PRO-FV
    ‘Koi said that he (Koi) is a hunter’ or ‘Koi said that he (someone else) is a
    hunter’While there is no overt means of coding coreferentiality of the two subjects
in the indicative mood, the subject of the complement clause can be omitted
when it shares the person, gender and number of the matrix clause subject.
When the subject of the complement clause is omitted, the assumption is that
the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the complement clause refer
to the same entity:(9) mùm láʔ i           na    (mùm) táʔ tu        rùm né nàn

    si
    ASSERT
    ‘He1 said that (he1) would show himself to me.’When the complement clause is in the subjunctive mood, as defined in chap-
ter 9, Pévé does make a distinction between coreferentiality and non-corefer-
entiality between the pronominal subject of the matrix clause and the pronom-
inal subject of the complement. When the subject of the complement clause
shares the person, gender and number value of the subject of the matrix clause
but is not coreferential with the subject of the matrix clause, the subject of the
complement clause is marked by a subject pronoun from the subjunctive set
(see chapter 6):(10) ta ín ne nùm tə́             ʔyá yé
     3F say ADP 3M.O 3F.SBJV leave PERM
     ‘she1 told him she2 should/could leave’(11) mum ín ne nùm nə                 ʔyá yé
     3M say ADP 3M.O 3M.SBJV leave PERM
     ‘he1 told him he2 should/could leave’The subjunctive pronoun is also used when the subject of the matrix and the
subject of the complement do not share person, gender and number:(12) mùm láʔ á       fàŋ mbə̀ tám kə́dàn ve    sə̀lày
     3M say 1SG.SBJV return today PURP collect money
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

      1PL.POSS-FV
      ‘He said I should come back today to collect my money.’The evidence that the subjunctive pronoun in the complement marks non-
coreferentiality rather than the subjunctive nature of the complement is that
when the subject of the subjunctive complement clause is coreferential with
the subject of the matrix clause, the same pronoun form is used in both clauses.
In other words, when the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the
complement clause have the same referent, the subjunctive mood of the com-
plement clause cannot be marked by the choice of subject pronoun. This leaves
the clause-final particle, such as yé (permission, obligation), as the only means
of marking the subjunctive mood in the complement:Coreferential subject (fem.):(13) ta ín ne nùm ta ʔyá yé
     3F say ADP 3M.O 3F leave PERM
     ‘she1 told him she1 could leave’Coreferential subject (masc.):(14) mum ín ne nùm mum ʔyá yé
     3M say ADP 3M.O 3M leave PERM
     ‘he1 told him he1 could leave’Coreferentiality of the subject of the complement and matrix clauses can be
emphasized by the use of a coreferential non-perfective object pronoun after
the subject of the complement:(15) ta ín ne nùm ta sə ʔyá yé
     3F say ADP 3M.O 3F 3F.O leave PERM
     ‘she1 told him she1 could leave’(16) mum ín ne nùm mum um ʔyá yé
     3M say ADP 3M.O 3M 3M.O leave PERM
     ‘he1 told him he1 could leave’There appears to be no means of indicating the referential relationship
between the addressee of the matrix clause and the subject of the comple-
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

same reference, the subject of the complement is marked by a pronoun from
the subjunctive set:(17) hándày ín ne mbà mə́           ʔyá sí
     3PL      say ADP 1PL 1PL.SBJV leave EE

same reference:(18) ə̀ŋ laʔ sə́ nə̀ mbə̀ ye
     2F say 3F 3M come SUBJ
     ‘you (fem.) tell her that he should come’When the complement is in the indicative mood there is no distinction
between the coreferentiality and lack of coreferentiality of the addressee and
the subject of the complement. This is also true of the subject of the comple-
ment (Gwà) and the possessor within the complement (‘his hoe’):(19) Taú ín ne kə          Gwà i           mum ɗúm wa kávà ùmù

In constructions consisting of a matrix clause followed by a complement, the
complement may or may not be preceded by a complementizer. Unlike in
some Chadic languages, such as Lele (East Chadic; Frajzyngier 2001), the pres-
ence or form of a complementizer following a verb of saying in Pévé does not
necessarily depend on whether the complement represents direct or indirect
speech.
   Markers used in constructions involving a matrix-clause verb of saying
include the inherent complementizer i and the impersonal pronoun na (see
chapter 11). Use of an impersonal pronoun as a complementizer in Pévé is much
like the use of the English form ‘that’, which may function as either a pronoun
or a complementizer depending on position and context. The Pévé form na,
which may occur independently or may be preceded by the complementizer i,
functions as a complementizer with only a small set of verbs, including làʔ ‘to
say, to tell’, in ‘to speak, to tell’, and ɗìk ‘to believe’ (see section 4, below). The
                                                                         Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

as well as with verbs of saying, as shown in later sections.","[285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290]"
"2.4      Domain de dicto vs. Domain de re
Some verbs of saying, including the simple verb ó ‘to request’ and the com-
pound verb tʃi vun ‘to ask’, may be followed by either a complement belonging to
the domain de dicto or a complement belonging the domain de re. The domain
de dicto, as defined in Frajzyngier and Jasperson 1991, consists of complements
involving direct or indirect speech, while complements in the domain de re
refer to an element of reality, such as an object or a location. The distinguishing
characteristic of the domain de re is that the complement has the grammatical
role of object in the matrix clause. The de re complement, unlike the de dicto
complement, is thus a dependent clause:                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

of the matrix clause:(40) na ó mbì ɓá                 rum-u

clause is marked as the possessor of the nominalized verb:(41) na ó káw ɓá                      wə     hayʔ ndày-à

The only tense or aspect contrast attested in the complement clause is between
the perfective aspect and the unmarked aspect. The perfective aspect is marked
in the complement, as it is in the independent clause, by high tone on the verb
and the absence of a tense/aspect marker:(44) Taú ín ne kə          Gwà i           mum ɗúm wa kávà ùm-ù

     1SG say man other among 2PL.POSS one take dog 1SG.POSS
     kum-u
     yesterday-FV
     ‘I said, “One of you took my dog yesterday.” ’In complement clauses referring to an ongoing or unbounded event, only the
unmarked aspect is attested. There are no examples of the imperfective marker
wə́ in the complement:(46) mláʔ       hĩ       ha tʃìʔi maandə́        nəʔ su
     mum láʔ hẽ          ha tʃiʔ mi         ndə́ na    su

without the future marker də̀, but the future marker can be added without a
change in meaning:(48) mum gwaʔ láʔ ne nùm na               [na]mbà (də̀) faŋ      zàʔ

     ASSERT PREP head 1SG.POSS whitish-FV
     ‘He told him, “If you come here, you (will) know me because my head is
     whitish.”’The question is whether constructions like examples 48 and 49 result from
omission of a tense/aspect marker or whether they represent the unmarked
aspect, whose temporal function is deduced from surrounding discourse or
the shared understanding of speaker and hearer. The context of example 50,
combined with the S O V order of constituents in the complement (bolded),
suggests that the construction results from omission of a tense/aspect marker,
in this case the future marker. Recall that the order of elements in the indepen-
dent future clause is S də̀ O V when the object is pronominal:(50) mum də̀ sə́ tsoɓ síw-i
     3M FUT 3F.O buy tomorrow-FV
     ‘he will buy it (fem.) tomorrow’The absence of overt markers of non-perfective tense or aspect in the com-
plement clause suggests that Pévé, like many Chadic languages, distinguishes
between pragmatically independent clauses and pragmatically dependent
clauses, where the two types of clauses code different sets of tense and aspect
distinctions using different sets of coding means (Frajzyngier with Shay 2002,
Frajzyngier and Johnston with Edwards 2005, Creissels 2008 and Bril 2010).","[293, 294, 295, 296]"
"   In a clause containing a subject, an object, and an indirect object, the means
of distinguishing the direct object from the indirect object depends on the
aspect and mood of the clause and on whether the argument is represented
by a noun or a pronoun. The basics are outlined in Table 11. ‘N’ represents a
noun; ‘PRO’ represents a pronoun; ‘T/A’ represents a marker of tense or aspect;
ne is an adposition whose role is confined to marking the indirect object;
and kə is the associative preposition. The nominal or pronominal status of
the subject, or even the absence of a subject, has no impact on other coding
means. Because there are no Tense/Aspect markers in any perfective/subjunc-
tive clauses, and because Tense/Aspect markers can often be omitted from
non-perfective clauses, pronoun forms and constituent order are often the only
means of coding tense and aspect.
   The following generalizations can be made about the preceding chart:
1. In the perfective clause, ne precedes the indirect object
2. In the non-perfective clause, ne follows the indirect object
3. In the perfective clause, the indirect object can be marked by position
      alone, provided it immediately follows the verb and is immediately fol-
      lowed by a nominal direct object.
4. The position between subject and verb serves as a coding means in two
      circumstances:
      (a) in the non-perfective clause with a pronominal direct object and no
            indirect object (S O V); and
                                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

             object and a nominal direct object, the order S (Tense/Aspect) IO V
             O alternates with S (Tense/Aspect) V IO ne.
As noted in earlier sections, there can be alternative constructions for the same
set of participants. The evidence that this is not a function of the choice of lex-
ical items is that a clause with the same verb and the same participants may
have different forms. For example, the perfective forms S V O ne IO, S V ne IO
O, and S (Tense/Aspect) IO V O are all attested involving the verbs ‘to sell’ and
‘to give’, with the same participants. The non-perfective forms S (Tense/Aspect)
V O IO ne and S (Tense/Aspect) IO V O are both attested with the verb ‘to sell’
and the same participants.","[140, 141]"

2        Temporal AdjunctsPévé has a rich set of temporal nouns and noun phrases, some of which are
listed below. Most of these nouns function as temporal adjuncts without addi-
tional marking. Most may have either deictic or non-deictic reference, e.g., tám
‘today’ (deictic) or ‘these days, now’ (non-deictic); kum ‘yesterday’ (deictic) or
‘the past’ (non-deictic):wə́ta       ‘last year’
wãy         ‘three days ago’; ‘three days before (some point in time)’; ‘latest,
            most recent’
kum         ‘yesterday’; ‘in the past’
tám         ‘today’; ‘in the present’
ʃiw         ‘tomorrow’
sədayʔ      ‘the day after tomorrow’ or ‘two days after (some point in time)’
sədayʔ dayʔ ‘the day after the day after tomorrow’ or ‘three days after (some
            point in time)’
wãy zaʔ kum ‘the day before yesterday’ or ‘two days before’ (lit. ‘three days ago
            plus yesterday’)

lowed by a temporal noun: kə bə̀kà/ fə̀tà/riya ‘morning, afternoon, evening’. The
phrase kə fə̀tà (ASSC ‘sun’) is also used to refer to the dry season. Adding a deic-
tic noun or deictic determiner makes the temporal reference deictic, as in tám

    ‘today she sold all the milk’As is the case in many languages, the adverbials kum ‘yesterday’ and tám ‘today’
may code broad reference to the past and the present, respectively. In the next
example the adjunct zaʔ ‘still’ (also ‘plus’, as in wãy zaʔ kum, above), combined
with negation, emphasizes the fact that the state does not obtain at the present
time:(7) ta ké       ɓáy kum           àmá tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi

     ‘she will sell it another tomorrow’ (for ‘she will sell it in a week’)Reference to time on a clock is coded by the associative preposition kə followed
by the phrase ndʒike (‘iron’) + Numeral. The term ‘iron’ goes back to to the
metal watches introduced decades ago by Europeans. The distinction between
morning and evening is coded by the marker mə followed by a temporal noun
or noun phrase: mə rìyà ‘afternoon’, mə (vun) bə̀kà ‘morning’ (‘mouth of the

adverbials, gwáʔ occurs between the subject and the verb. This is a feature that
gwáʔ shares with the conditional marker làʔ (cf. chapter 18), the future tense
marker də̀, the aspect markers wə́ (IMPF) and ké (progressive aspect), and the
auxiliary gàk ‘to be able’. Since làʔ and də̀ are clearly derived from verbs (làʔ
‘to say’, də̀ ‘to go’), it is likely that gwáʔ ‘then’ and other preverbal markers are
also of verbal origin. The following examples show the use of gwáʔ in natural

3       Associative and Instrumental AdjunctsAs shown in chapter 5, the associative preposition kə may conjoin two nouns

4       Manner AdjunctsThe clause-final marker go ~ gwa, perhaps derived from the temporal adverbial
gwáʔ (see section 2, above), softens a command addressed to the hearer. The
marker go, with the underlying form gwáʔ, is glossed as ‘now’, as its function is
curiously similar to that of the English consolatory forms ‘now, now’ and ‘there,
there’:(34) à          tʃiʔ mì go

co-occur with the subjunctive marker riʔ, which codes the addressee’s obliga-
tion:

5       Intensity, Repetition, and RecurrenceThis section describes adjuncts coding repetition, recurrence, or intensity of an
event. Some adjuncts are single lexical items, some are derived through dupli-
cation, and others are prepositional phrases.
   As shown in chapter 5, reduplication of the verb conveys some meanings
that are conveyed by adverbs in many other languages, such as intensity or rep-
etition of the event:(45) tʃiʔ vay wə́      màn gu(n)-gun-u
     cry child IMPF 1SG.O bother-bother-FV

     body 1SG.POSS eat.eat (intrans.)
     ‘I am very sick’ (lit. ‘my body is eating me’)Intensity can also be conveyed by the clause-final modifier ɓáyrúm ‘very, much’.
The scope of the modifier is the entire clause:

inal complement in the direct object position. Evidence that the complement
is a noun is that it is modified by a possessive pronoun:(113) wãy         záʔ kum         ta gé     ndoʔ sin sá
      3 days ago plus yesterday 3F make end work 3F.POSS

this case, ndóʔ functions as a modifier rather than the nominal constituent of
a compound verb:(115) hə́ŋ làʔ      gí    kwáti ndóʔ si,          nambà də̀ ti

The compound verb káw ɓá ‘to help’ (‘take/grab hand’) may be followed by
a nominalized verb marked by the associative preposition kə. The object of
the main verb is represented by an inalienable possessive pronoun, proof that
the verb is a compound verb. The only examples are elicited different-subject

The verb gí has a wide range of functions, including serving alone as a verb of
creation (‘to do, to make’) and serving as the first component in a number of
compound verbs. The verb gí alone can also function as a verb of causation.
In this case, gí is followed by a different-subject complement consisting of an
object pronoun followed by a verb in the unmarked form. Use of the object pro-
noun indicates that the subject of the causative complement, unlike the subject
of the volitional complement, has a grammatical role in the main clause:(119) mum gí     nàn ʔyá
      3M make 1SG.O leave
      ‘he made me leave’(120) na gí      nùm ʔyá

of complementizers, the independent vs. dependent nature of the comple-
ment, and the coding of the complement as the object of the matrix clause.
Unlike in some Chadic languages, the common verbs of saying in Pévé do
not differentiate between complements representing direct speech and com-
plements representing indirect speech. Exceptions are complements of verbs
corresponding to ‘ask’ or ‘answer’, which do appear to mark the difference
between direct and indirect speech. Verbs of asking make a distinction between
the domain de dicto, coded by an independent-clause complement, and the
domain de re, coded by a dependent-clause complement that functions as the
direct object of the matrix clause. Verbs of perception, cognition, and volition
make a similar distinction using the same means. The verb corresponding to
‘to be able’ is an auxiliary rather than a matrix verb and can also function as
the sole verb in a predication. Complements of ‘to be able’, ‘to want’, and cog-
nitive verbs are attested with the counterfactual marker kə̀və́, whose function
is to indicate that the subject’s wish or desire, or the speaker’s estimation of
the subject’s ability, was unfulfilled. A number of verbs, including ɮé ‘to start’,
ge ndoʔ ‘to finish, to end’, and káw ɓá ‘to help’, have complements only in the
domain de re, where the complement is a nominalized verb or a verbal clause
whose subject is the object of the matrix clause.","[308, 309, 310, 311]"
"3.2.1      Pronoun as Direct Object: Perfective Set
A very important distinction between the perfective set of object pronouns and
the non-perfective set has to do with how the function of direct object is coded.
As shown below, the direct object function of a pronoun from the perfective
set is marked by the position immediately after the verb in both the perfective
aspect and the subjunctive mood (SVO), while the direct object function of a
pronoun from the non-perfective set is marked by the position before the verb
(SOV; see below).
   Like subject pronouns, object pronouns convey the gender of the second-
or third-person referent and the number of the first, second-, or third-person
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

An object pronoun from the non-perfective set can be used to represent the
direct object in all non-perfective indicative constructions but cannot be used
in subjunctive constructions. The perfective/subjunctive object set is repeated
in Table 9 (above) for purposes of comparison.
   The existence of two sets of object pronouns distinguished by tense, aspect
and mood is relatively rare across languages. The fact that most object pro-
nouns in the perfective set in Pévé have an initial n suggests that a marker n(V)
may once have had the function of distinguishing the object in a perfective
clause from the object in a non-perfective clause. It is also possible that the
marker n(V) at one time served as a postverbal marker of perfective aspect,
resulting in the following tentative path of evolution: Verb+nV Pronoun > Verb
nV Pronoun > Verb nV+Pronoun.
   As shown in chapter 8, non-perfective tenses and aspects may be marked by
(a) use of the unmarked tone on the verb, or (b) a preverbal marker followed by
the verb with unmarked tone. When the direct object in a non-perfective and
non-subjunctive clause is marked by a pronoun, the pronoun follows the tense
or aspect marker and precedes the main verb, resulting in the order Subject
Tense/Aspect (T/A) marker Object Verb. (The term T/A is used instead of the
usual term TAM (tense/aspect/mood) because mood is not indicated by mark-
ers before, after, or attached to the verb; it is instead indicated by the choice of
pronoun forms and phrase-final particles (see chapter 9)). The means of coding
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

different from the means of coding the direct object function of a pronoun in
a perfective clause (see above), where the pronominal direct object immedi-
ately follows the verb. Recall that the nominal direct object in a clause with
only one non-subject argument immediately follows the verb, regardless of the
tense, aspect, or mood of the clause. Thus, the only situation in which the direct
object precedes the verb is the non-perfective/non-subjunctive clause that has
a pronominal object:
   Here are some examples contrasting the position of the non-perfective
object pronoun with that of the perfective object pronoun:Imperfective aspect (S T/A OV):(53) lum wə́       sə́ ti
     lion IMPF 3F.O eat
     ‘the lion is eating it’Cf. the perfective form (SVO):(54) lum tí sá

     3F FUT 3M.O hit-FV
     ‘she will hit him’Cf. the perfective form (SVO):(56) ta púm nùm
     3F hit 3M.O
     ‘she hit him’Other examples of the non-perfective object pronoun in preverbal position:(57) ʃīŋ    ɬew wə       man gun-u
     smell meat IMPF 1SG.O bother-FV
     ‘the smell of the meat is bothering me’

     3M FUT 3F.O buy tomorrow(-FV)
     ‘he will buy it tomorrow’In a clause that has the same arguments and the same temporal value, the direct
object in the form of a full noun follows rather than precedes the verb, resulting
in the form S T/A VO:(59) mum də̀ tsòɓ vu síw(-i)
     3M FUT buy salt tomorrow-FV
     ‘he will buy salt tomorrow’(60) mum wə́       tsòɓ vu
     3M PRES buy salt
     ‘he is buying salt (now)’In a non-perfective clause, the marker coding future tense or imperfective
aspect is often omitted in natural discourse. If the direct object is pronomi-
nal, the use of a pronoun from the non-perfective set and the position of the
pronoun before the verb indicates that the clause is non-perfective, i.e. neither
perfective nor subjunctive. Whether the clause is interpreted as imperfective
or future depends on the context and the nature of the event:(61) ha màn yè         si
     2M 1SG.O know ASSERT
     ‘You know me.’ or ‘You will know me.’
4       Indirect ObjectIn Pévé, means of distinguishing between the function of indirect object and
the function of direct object include the relative order of constituents in the
clause and the use of the designated indirect object marker ne, derived from
the noun ne ‘give’. The form ne is glossed ‘ADP’ for ‘adposition’, as it sometimes
occurs before the noun or pronoun representing the indirect object and some-
times occurs after the noun or pronoun representing the indirect object (see
below). As shown in Améka 2003, the use of the same adposition in either
prenominal or postnominal position is very rare across languages (the exam-
ple Améka 2003 provides comes from Dutch, as described in Van Riemsdijk
1990). As shown below, the means of coding the grammatical role of the indi-
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the presence or absence of an overt direct object.
   While the precise semantic role of the indirect object is a function of the
inherent meaning of the verb and the arguments in the clause, the indirect
object is typically less directly affected by the event than is the direct object.
The semantic roles of indirect object arguments include the recipient of a thing
given, the beneficiary of the event, the addressee of certain verbs, and a par-
ticipant who suffers from the event (‘malefactive’). The semantic roles of the
indirect object are further discussed in chapter 7.
   The following sections describe the means of marking the indirect object
role of a nominal argument, the means of marking the indirect object role of a
pronominal argument in a perfective or subjunctive clause, and the means of
marking the indirect object role of a pronominal argument in a non-perfective
clause.","[128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"

         chapter 6Coding Grammatical Relations1        IntroductionThe term ‘grammatical relations’ refers here to the functional relations between
the verb and the noun phrase(s) in a clause. These relations include the sub-
ject, the object, and the indirect object, as defined in sections below. As stated
in chapter 1, in the pronoun set there is no distinction between direct object
pronouns and indirect object pronouns. The terms ‘direct object’ and ‘indirect
object’, as used in the present chapter, thus refer to the grammatical relations
between the verb and its arguments rather than to the form of the pronoun that
represents an argument. Because there is no direct vs. indirect object distinc-
tion within the pronoun system, a pronoun that may represent either a direct
object or an indirect object is referred to simply as an object pronoun, glossed
as O for ‘Object’.
    In addition to subject vs. object pronoun distinctions, the grammatical rela-
tionship between a given noun phrase and the verb can be coded by one or
more of the following means: the position of the noun phrase with respect to
the verb; the position of the noun phrase with respect to another noun phrase;
the indirect object marker ne (glossed ‘ADP’ for ‘adposition’), derived from the
verb ‘to give’; the associative preposition kə; a pronoun coding a specific gram-
matical relation; and the position of a pronoun with respect to another noun
phrase or pronoun. Pronouns are neither prefixes nor suffixes, and there is no
coding of grammatical relations on the verb itself or on the noun stem. Pévé
also has an impersonal pronoun, na, whose functions in the domains of ref-
erence and complementation resemble the functions of ‘that’, ‘it’ and certain
other forms in English. The form na and its functions are discussed in chapters
11 and 19.
    An important feature of Pévé is that the coding of grammatical relations
is inseparable from the coding of tense, aspect, and mood. Different linear
orders and different pronoun forms are used in different tenses, aspects, and
moods, and in some cases the choice of pronoun form and/or the linear order
of constituents is the only means of coding tense, aspect, or mood (see chap-
ters 8–10). With respect to the subject argument, the primary distinction is
between the indicative mood and the subjunctive mood. With respect to all
other arguments, the primary distinction is between the perfective aspect and
the subjunctive mood on the one hand and all other tenses, aspects, and moods

‘non-perfective’. The interaction of grammatical relations with other means of
coding tense, aspect, and mood is explored further in later chapters.
   This chapter describes the means of coding the grammatical relations sub-
ject, object, and indirect object in perfective and non-perfective simple sen-
tences. The interaction of grammatical relations and mood is further discussed
in chapter 9. The coding of grammatical relations in negative clauses is ad-
dressed in chapter 14, and the coding of grammatical relations in complex
sentences is addressed in chapter 19.","[118, 119, 120]"

2       Bus Trip: Lazare WambadangThe following non-fiction narrative was related by Lazare Wambadang in 2012
and was transcribed and translated by author and collaborator in the course of
fieldwork. The narrative has been subject to considerable analysis in producing
the present volume. Again, the transcription of tone was augmented by the use
of Praat software.","[334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"
"3.1      Perfective Aspect
The only typically verbal function that can be marked on the verb in Pévé is
the perfective aspect, marked by high tone on the first syllable of the verb. As
shown in chapters 8 and 9, all other tenses, aspects, and moods involve the
unmarked (also called the non-perfective) form of the verb along with mark-
ers outside the main verb. Therefore, only the perfective aspect is discussed
in this section. The function of the perfective aspect is described in chap-
ter 8.
    The tone of the non-perfective (unmarked) form of the verb is considered to
be the underlying tone. Most verbs have mid tone in the unmarked form. The
bisyllabic verb gewa ‘to return to another place’, for example, has underlying
mid tone in the citation form and in non-perfective forms:(1) mum wə        gewa Garoua
    3M IMPF return G.
    ‘he is returning to Garoua’(2) mum də̀ gewa Garoua síw
    3M FUT return G.            tomorrow
    ‘he will return to Garoua tomorrow’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

verb:(3) handày géwa Garoua si
    3PL      return G.     ASSERT
    ‘they returned from Garoua’A few verbs have underlying low tone, e.g. tà ‘to walk’, wàʔ ‘to want, to need’,
and də̀ ‘to go’:(4) ta wə́     tà
    3F IMPF walk
    ‘she is walking’(5) ta də̀ tà
    3F FUT walk
    ‘she will walk’In the perfective aspect, the low-tone verb, like the mid-tone verb, has high
tone. Evidence for the perfective function is provided by use of the adverbial
kúm ‘yesterday’, which indicates that the event occurred before the time of
speech:(6) Gwà tá lúmò kúm            kə́dàn tsoɓ keve
    G. go market yesterday PURP buy fish
    for ‘Gwa went to the market yesterday to buy fish’An even smaller set of verbs has underlying high tone. Evidence for the under-
lying high tone is provided by the fact that the verb with high tone occurs in
non-perfective constructions:(7) na wə́      dʒí    hu
    1SG IMPF watch goat(s)
    ‘I’m watching the goats’(8) à         də̀ dʒí     hu

of coding the perfective aspect is retention of the underlying high tone and the
absence of any other marks of tense or aspect:(9) mum dʒí      hu
    3M watch goat(s)
    ‘he watched the goat(s)’Such verbs provide evidence that tone on the verb is underlying and that high
tone on the verb codes the perfective aspect.","[83, 84, 85]"
"2.2      The Current Approach
Native speakers of Pévé do not necessarily agree with the nomenclature or clas-
sification of the Pévé language as described in section 2.1. According to native
Pévé speaker and collaborator Lazare Wambadang, Sachnine’s use of the term
Lamé to refer to Vún Dzəbao reflects the fact that speakers of Pévé and Dzebao
in Cameroon accept the term Lamé to refer to their respective languages (Sach-
nine 1982). In a region inhabited by Dzebao, including the villages of Dzebao,
Gor, Ganmbour, Madingring, and others, speakers will state that they are Lamé
speakers, while recognizing that there is a difference between the dialect of
Pévé and their own dialect, namely Dzebao. The Ethnologue list of alternative
names for Pévé, which includes Kado, Kaʔdo Pévé (both pejorative), Lamé, and
Zimé, does not reflect the current state of affairs. Kaʔɗó is a derogatory term
used by Herdé speakers in referring to Pévé. The Pévé people do not accept the
name Zimé as their own, since Zimé is a language they don’t understand and a
culture whose customs they don’t share. The Zimé (Herdé) of Chad do not want
to be termed Lamé because this would lead to classification with the Canton
Lamé even though their own canton is Canton Herdé. Despite this opposition, a
princess of the Chief of Canton Lamé (therefore Pévé) is married to the current
head of Canton de Herdé. In any case, Ethnologue has not identified a dialect
that is neither Pévé nor Vún Dzebao, much less Herdé or simply Zimé.
    Wambadang’s studies show that none of the classifications adopted in pre-
vious linguistic works fully captures the historical and linguistic relationships
among Pévé speakers and speakers of neighboring and/or related languages.",[18]
"2.6      Glottal Stop: ʔ
In at least one instance, the word-initial glottal stop contrasts with the word-
initial vowel: ʔi ‘to insult’ vs. ì (2PL subjunctive subject pronoun). In word-final
position, the glottal stop contrasts with the voiceless velar stop (and other con-
sonants):dzòʔ     ‘to plant’; ‘to scoop up a paste’ vs. dzòk ‘to pound grain with a mortar
         and pestle’
gaʔ      ‘side’ vs. gàk ‘to be able’The primary evidence for the glottal stop as a phoneme is provided by a large
number of minimal pairs with word-final glottal stops vs. word-final vowels:tʃiʔ     ‘to cry’ vs. tʃi ‘to kill’, ‘to weave’
ʃeʔe     ‘tooth’; ‘egg’ (homonym) vs. ʃe ‘to fall, to rain’
gã ́ʔ   ‘broth made with cold water and grain’ vs. gã ‘brush, shrubs’
soʔ      ‘cold’ (ADJ) vs. sò ‘bone’
zuʔ      ‘to pound (a grain)’ vs. zu ‘bottom of something (animate or inani-
         mate)’
                                                                           Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

as is the case with the adverbial sə́dayʔ in the following:(1) mum gyɛ́wambə̀         sə́day
    mum géwa        mbə sədayʔ
    3M return       come two.days.later
    ‘He came back two days later.’Evidence for the word-final glottal stop is that the glottal stop is retained when
the morpheme is followed by a final vowel (FV; see chapter 3):(2) mum géwa mbə sədayʔ-a
    3M return come two.days.later-FV
    ‘He came back two days later.’An epenthetic glottal stop may precede a word-initial vowel to place empha-
sis on the word or morpheme that follows. The glottal stop may occur between
consecutive vowels, as in the example below:(3) gewa ʔà          fãye
    gewa à           faŋ  ye
    return 2M.SBJV repeat PERM
    ‘“Go back again!”’The epenthetic glottal stop with the emphatic function can also occur between
a word-final consonant and a word-initial vowel:(4) ɛɛ kəri mə̀ní … mum ʔín ne nùm ndə́ naʔ-a ….
    ɛɛ kəri mə̀ni mum ín ne nùm ndə́ naʔ-a ….
    eh when         3M say ADP 3M.O like I.PRO-FV
    ‘When he told him that …’2.7     Glottal Fricative: h
The contrast between the initial glottal fricative /h/ and an initial vowel is
found in a few lexical items:     hu ‘goat’ vs. ú ‘millet’
     hoɓ ‘two’ vs. o ‘to ask’
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

Pévé distinguishes among the velar stops /k/ and /g/, the velar nasal /ŋ/, and
velar fricative /ɣ/:/k/        ka ‘where’; kə (associative preposition); ku ‘fire’
/g/        gàk ‘to be able’; ge ‘to throw’; gú ‘tree’
/ŋ/        ŋak ‘crowned crane’ (bird)
/ɣ/        ɣaw ‘fight’ (N); ɣàr ‘to hurry’In word-final position, the velar nasal /ŋ/ contrasts with the alveolar nasal /n/:tʃiriŋ     ‘deep’ vs. tʃin ‘to place, to put’
nàŋ        (2F object pronoun) vs. nàn (1SG object pronoun)The velar nasal may carry tone, as evidenced by the form hŋ́ , a variant of the
form hə́ŋ (2F indicative subject pronoun). In the form ŋ̀ , a variant of the 2F sub-
junctive subject pronoun ə̀ŋ, the velar nasal is syllabic and carries the low tone
of the underlying form:(5) ŋ̀        làʔ sə́ tə̀        mbə̀ ye
    2F.SBJV say 3F.O 3F.SBJV come PERM
    ‘(you) tell her she should come’There are a few instances where /kw/ and /gw/ contrast with non-labialized
stops:/kw/       kwá ‘thing’ vs. ka ‘where’
/gw/       gwaʔ ‘then’ vs. gaʔ ‘side’Given that the labialized velar stops are rare in the language, it is likely that
/kw/ and /gw/ have their origins in a stop followed by a round vowel, as has
been posited for other labialized consonants. Support for this is provided by
free variants such go ~ gwaʔ ‘then’. However, given the contrasting pairs above,
the labialized velars are considered phonemic.","[50, 51, 52]"
"2.4     Alveolar Affricates: ts, dz, dʒ
The voiceless alveolar affricate /ts/ contrasts with the alveolar stop /t/, above,
the alveolar fricative /s/, and the voiced alveolar affricates /dz/ and /dʒ/:
                                                                          Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
phonology                                                                               33/ts/    tsar ‘to wake up, to get up’; tsává ‘courtyard’; tsoɓ ‘to sell’; ‘purchase’ (N);
        tsú NEG
/tʃ/    tʃop ‘primary, first of all’There is free variation in labialization of the alveolar affricate before a round
vowel in an open syllable, e.g. tsóhoʔ ~ tswóhoʔ ‘eight’. This variation is not
apparent in the closed syllable: tsoɓ ‘to trade’, ‘purchase’ (N), but not *tswoɓ.
   The alveolar affricate /dz/ contrasts with the voiceless /ts/ and the palato-
alveolar affricate /dʒ/:/dz/    dzàk ‘to chop, cut into pieces’, dzòk ‘to pound grain using a mortar and
        pestle’, dzúk ‘to despise’The palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ is considered underlying because it may be
followed by a non-front, non-high vowel:/dʒ/    dʒí ‘to tend, to watch over’; dʒek (a small melon with white flesh); dʒwə̀
        ‘chief’In some cases there is free variation between the non-palatalized and palatal-
ized forms, as in dzìku vs. dʒìku ‘very (much)’. Before a mid front vowel, an
additional palatal glide may be inserted between the palato-alveolar affricate
and the vowel, as in dʒyew ‘tent, shelter’, dʒyèw ‘to tie something’.
   The voiced prenasalized affricate /ndz/ contrasts with /dz/:/ndz/ ndzar ‘sister’, ndzə̀r ‘brother’, ndzur ‘cousin’; ndzor (a wild vine-like
      plant)The voiced prenasalized affricate is palatalized before a high front vowel, as in
ndʒike ‘iron’, and optionally palatalized before a high back vowel, as in ndzuku
~ ndʒuku (a type of mouse).
   In some instances a labialized affricate appears to contrast with the non-
labialized affricate, e.g. tswə ‘to chew something crunchy’ vs. tsú (negative
marker); dʒwə ‘chief’ vs. dzùk ‘to despise’. It is likely that the labial feature is
a result of an underlying round vowel following the affricate. This hypothesis
is supported by the forms ndzú ‘to chew something crunchy’ in Lamé (Sach-
nine 1982: 437) and Dari (Wambadang p.c.) and the Lamé form dùwà ‘religious
leader’ (Sachnine 1982: 355). Moreover, since there appear to be no contrastive
forms *tsə and *dʒə in Pévé, the labialized alveolar affricates are not considered
phonemic.","[48, 49]"
"Given the initial Stop+Stop sequence in gbə̀gbóŋ ‘strong’, and given the lack
of other three-consonant clusters, it is possible that the sequence /gb/ (and
perhaps also /kp/) represents a single consonant, rendering /mgb/ a two-
consonant cluster of the form Nasal stop+Stop.
   The few attested medial consonant clusters are very likely the result of com-
pounding or prefixing. These include mandréw ‘pimiento’; daŋgráwʔ ‘praying
mantis’; dukri ‘night’ (from duk ‘heart, middle’ ri ‘time’).
   The only attested morpheme-final clusters consist of a continuant followed
by a glottal stop:gwayʔ   ‘mountain’ vs. gwáʔ ‘to stay’
hayʔ    ‘near, next to, beside’ vs. ndày (3PL possessive pronoun)
dáŋʔ    ‘all’ vs. fáŋ ‘to return, to come back’
ʔyeŋʔ   ‘gently, weakly, sneakily’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

tal stop is as follows: Repetition of the last vowel in an utterance indicates the
end of an utterance (see chapter 3). If the morpheme ends in a palatal glide,
the final added vowel is a copy of the preceding vowel:(26) handày géwa tá só          ndày-a
     3PL     return go house 3PL.POSS-FV
     ‘they went back to their house’If the morpheme to which the vowel is added ends in /y/ followed by a glottal
stop, the added vowel is /i/. This provides evidence for the contrast between /y/
and /yʔ/ in word-final position:(27) handày gáyʔ-i
     3PL      stay/rest-FV
     ‘they stayed/rested’The underlying glottal stop after a continuant is sometimes deleted at the nor-
mal rate of speech when followed by another consonant:(28) mum mbə́ záa dzənàk         gáy zə̀       gu raw
     mum mbə̀ záʔ dzənàk         gáyʔ zə̀      gú ráw
     3M come find guinea fowl sit PREP tree many
     ‘He came and found guinea fowls sitting under a tree.’4.3       Syllable and Word Structure
As noted in chapter1, the following syllable structures are attested in Pévé: V, CV,
VC, CCV(C), CCCVC (one example), and C(C) (one example: hŋ (2F indicative
subject pronoun)). The great majority of lexical and grammatical morphemes
are monosyllabic. In many instances, a polysyllabic word or morpheme shows
evidence of affixation, reduplicating, or compounding, e.g., məsín ‘other, some,
one of’ (mə REL/POSS+sín ‘different’); nambà 1PL subject (na (demonstra-
tive?)+mbà (1PL object and possessive pronoun)); kwáti ‘food’ (kwá ‘thing’+ ti
‘eat’); ryéŋ-ryéŋ(e) ‘very small, thin’ (ryéŋ ‘small, thin’). Some, but not all, poly-
syllabic words that cannot be readily broken down into monosyllabic parts are
borrowings, e.g. dəbã ́ʔ ‘tobacco’ (Fr. tabac).
   Unlike some Chadic languages, Pévé does not draw a phonological distinc-
tion between lexical categories: Nouns, verbs, other lexical morphemes, and
grammatical morphemes all share the same syllabic structure and the same
phonological constraints.","[63, 64]"

2        ConsonantsTable 2 depicts the underlying consonants posited for Pévé in the present work.
Forms in brackets are those used in Venberg 1975. These forms are provided for
the reader’s benefit, as Pévé speakers are accustomed to the system developed
by Venberg in the 1960s for writing and reading Pévé (cf. Venberg 1985 and other
works).
   The following sections provide evidence for the contrastive nature of
the proposed underlying consonants and describe the phonetic variants of
the underlying consonants. In most cases, the phonological contrast among
consonants is illustrated by word-initial forms. The distribution (initial, medial,
final, clusters) of various consonants is described in section 4 (phonotactics).
   An underlying non-palatalized consonant is often palatalized when fol-
lowed by a front vowel. This is a matter of free variation. An underlying palatal-
ized consonant, such as /ʃ/ or /ʒ/, may be followed by the palatal glide /y/
before a high or mid front vowel. Only two palatalized consonants, /dʒ/ and
/ny/, are demonstrably underlying, as these are the only two palatalized con-
sonants attested before a non-front, non-high vowel. Because palatalization of
an underlying non-palatalized consonant is a matter of free variation, the tran-
scription of a given utterance may or may not depict palatalization.

also exists as a phonemic segment. For example, the underlying nasal segment
/n/ is often palatalized as /ny/ when followed by a front vowel, as evidenced
by the free variants ne ~ nye (an adposition, derived from the verb ‘give’, that
is used to mark the indirect object). The palatalized nasal /ny/ also has phone-
mic status because it occurs before both front and non-front vowels, as in nyem
‘song’ and nyã ‘earth’. Table 3 (below) shows phonetic consonant variants trig-
gered by the following vowel.
   The sections below, organized according to place and manner of articula-
tion, provide examples of forms that are solely phonetic and forms that are
phonetic in some instances and phonemic in others.","[45, 46]"

2       Future Tense2.1       Form of the Future Tense
The future tense is marked by the form də̀, probably derived from the verb də̀
‘to go’, followed by the main verb. The main verb carries its underlying tone,
i.e., the tone that occurs in the citation form, in the unmarked verb form, and
in all tenses and aspects other than the perfective (see sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4,
below):(1) Taú də̀ tà lúmò
    T. FUT walk market
    ‘Tau will walk to the market’(2) ɓà     ha də̀ we      sakə sà      sù
    ɓay ha də̀ we sa kə                sa su
    CONJ 2M FUT know who ASSC who Q
    ‘So how will you know who is who?’Evidence that the future marker də̀ in such constructions is a grammatical
marker and not the phonetically similar verb ‘to go’ is provided by the fact that
the future construction does not necessarily involve movement (see preceding
example). Moreover, the future marker may co-occur with the main verb də ‘to
go’, evidence that the two forms have different functions:(3) Taú də̀ də lúmò
    T. FUT go market
    ‘Tau will go to the market’As shown in chapter 6, an object pronoun from the non-perfective set can inter-
vene between the future marker and the main verb. This is evidence that the
future marker, like other tense/aspect markers, is a constituent that is separate
from the main verb:

future tense marker:(5) na tsú də̀ gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn          ùm ne mì
    1SG NEG FUT sell          cow 1SG.POSS 3M.O ADP NEG
    ‘I will not sell him my cow’2.2     Function of the Future Tense
Evidence that the future marker də̀ codes the future tense is that it can be used
with an adverbial referring to a specific time in the future:(6) ta də̀ gewa Garoua síw
    3M FUT return G.          tomorrow
    ‘she will return from Garoua tomorrow’(7) dayna dùkrí mə̀ tám (pause) namba də̀ ke wə         Garoua
    after night REL today             1PL  FUT COP PREP G.
    ‘After tonight, we will be in Garoua.’The marker də̀ cannot be used in a clause that refers to the past or the time of
speech:(8) na *də̀ tsóɓ vú kúm-ú
    1SG FUT buy salt yesterday-FV
    *for ‘I bought salt yesterday’(9) á *də̀ tà rəʔ /riʔ/ go [gwa]
    1SG FUT walk already now
    *for ‘I can come on in now’Both clauses are grammatical without the future tense marker:(10) na tsóɓ vú kúm-ú
     1SG buy salt yesterday-FV
     ‘I bought salt yesterday’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
tense and aspect                                                                 141(11) á tà rəʔ /riʔ/ go [gwa]
     1SG walk already now
     ‘I can come on in now’Evidence that the future marker də̀ codes tense rather than aspect is that it can
be used in reference to a future bounded event, a future ongoing event, or a
future state, all of which are functions in the domain of aspect:(12) kəri məni kwáti làʔ      gí ndóʔ si,     nambà də̀ ti
     when      food COND finish ASSERT 1PL          FUT eat
     ‘when/if the food is ready, we will eat’(13) nambà də̀ ba(r)           dùkrí kerker      kə     gi sin-i
     1PL      FUT sleep/pass night all the time ASSC do work-FV
     ‘we will spend the night working’ (some Pévé dialects use bar while others
     use ba)(14) ta də̀ kè bay màn-a
     3F FUT be friend 1SG.POSS-FV
     ‘she will be my friend’Further evidence that də̀ is a tense marker is that it can co-occur with a marker
of aspect, such as the imperfective marker wə́. The marking of both tense and
aspect in the same clause is unusual in Chadic languages. In the following
examples, the imperfective marker is not required, but its use is considered
grammatical:(15) ta láʔá nambà (wə́) də̀ Pala
     3F say 1PL       IMPF go P.
     ‘she said, “We will be going to Pala”’(16) handày (wə) də tsoɓ bàfyek man ne
     3PL      IMPF FUT buy corn 1SG.O ADP
     ‘they will be buying corn for me’
3       AspectThe following aspectual distinctions are marked within the verb phrase: Perfec-
tive aspect, coded by high tone on the verb; imperfective aspect, coded by the
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

main verb; and the unmarked aspect, coded by use of the verb with underlying
tone and no other markers.
  An aspect marker, like the future marker, follows the subject noun or pro-
noun and precedes the verb. As illustrated in sections 3.2 and 3.3, other material
may intervene between the subject marker and the aspect marker or between
the aspect marker and the verb.","[155, 156, 157, 158]"

         chapter 3Parsing Morphology1        IntroductionMany lexical and grammatical morphemes in Pévé show an alternation be-
tween the phrase-internal form and the phrase-final form, which consists of
the phrase-internal form with an added final vowel. A phrase-final vowel can
be added to any morpheme whose citation form ends in a consonant, provided
that grammatical rules allow the morpheme to occur in phrase-final position.
A morpheme that has no meaning unless it is followed by additional material
does not undergo phrase-final vowel addition.
   As illustrated below, use of the phrase-final form of a given morpheme tells
the listener that the morpheme is the final component of the grammatical con-
stituent to which it belongs; in other words, that the constituent contains all
of the information that the speaker wishes to include, regardless of whether
the constituent is grammatically complete. A morpheme in phrase-internal
form, in contrast, tells the listener to expect more material within the same
constituent. With respect to final vowel alternation, the terms ‘phrase-internal
form’ and ‘phrase-final form’ are used for simplicity. The term ‘parsing morphol-
ogy’ refers to the alternation between phrase-internal forms and phrase-final
forms and the functions they perform.","[69, 70]"
