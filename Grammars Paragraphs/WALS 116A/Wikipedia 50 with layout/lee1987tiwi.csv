vary , though perhaps some , which are based on a combina t i on of the words f o r
' one ' , ' two ' , or ' three ' with some other form ( see Table 3 . 5 ) may vary . There
are variant f orms for mos t o f the nume rals but the use of these seems to de pend
upon the individua l , aris ing perhaps f rom dialect var i a t i ons .    It i s not clear
where the forms which a re l i sted in the school ma t e r i al came from. Godfrey has
found that in some old data she has the same forms as those l i s t e d by
Osborne . 34 When I e l i c i ted the numerals f rom an older man ( in his f i f t ie s ) he
gave me the same forms which are in the school mate r i a l .       It seems tha t they
are now the accepted forms .

       �n the new forms , whi ch I am class ing as L e s s Trad i t ional T i w i ( LTT ) , the
yati has been d ropped f rom the form kiringarra yati ' s ix ' so that ' s ix ' has
come to be j us t kiringarra ( given as an alternative by Osborne 1 9 7 4 : 1 5 3 ) . The
word kiringarra i ts e l f is a compound of kiri - 'hand , 3 5 and ngarra 'he ( ? ) ' , and
so i t may be that kiringarra was an old f orm of 'five ' ( or 'hand ' ) , though
Spencer gives punginingita , or a form of i t : binginida ( Spence r 1 9 1 4 : 4 65 ) . The
form f o r ' s ix' has been bui l t upon this , meaning ' f ive and one ' .     Since
kiringarra has been reanalysed as ' six' ( at least by some people ) , kiringarra
yati has been re analysed as ' seven' ( s ix plus one ) and kiringarra yirrara a s
' e i ght ' ( s i x p l u s two ) .","[105, 106]"

4.3. 1 . 2   FREE FORK VERBS IB Mr        The class of free ve rbs in MT is a large open class .        It is hard to
d e te rmine just how many free verbs the re are , as j us t about any Eng l i s h verb
seems to be able to be incorporated into the Tiwi of young people .              Somet imes
the meaning o f the verb is d i f f e rent f rom i t s Engl ish meaning ; for example ,
ki1im means ei ther 'ki l l ' or 'hi t ' , 1uk means e i ther ' look ' or 'see , . 7 1        Where there i s an exi s ting free form ve rb i n TT this seems t o be used
rather than an English loan verb in mos t case s .         In some ins tances the form may
be changed f rom the TT form.       Some t ime s this i s due to a regular sound change ,
or one which is fairly gene ral , such as t > rr between vowels ( see 2 . 3 . 5 ,
p . 38 ) , as in kurrup ( f rom TT kutupi 'j ump ' ) .  Some s peakers tend to drop the
f inal vowe l o f the f ree form verb .' So , throughout the range of young peopl e ' s
speech the four forms of kutupi may be found : kutupi , kutup , kurrupi , kurrup .",[213]

      ' they fough t '        I n Chi ldren ' s Tiwi , and a l s o in casual MT , f ree verb forms are used
without inf lected TT-de rived auxiliaries . S Olde r people also use this s ty le of
speech with chi ldre n . Before exces s ive influence f rom English there was
probably a baby talk Tiwi with the s ingular impe rat ive forms used as free form
verbs ( as they s t i l l are with some more common verbs ) . Howeve r , these days
baby talk Tiwi also contains many loan verbs . 6 Some young children ( of about 6
or 7 years ) , howeve r , know and are able to produce some forms of the aux i l i ary
and even some forms o f the independent inflected ve rb . The range of language
known and produced by chi ldren can be seen by the range of responses given for
s e t s o f pictures used to elicit vocabulary and expre ss ions f rom them .       Some
verbal forms were e l i c i ted by using a series of pictures of people (males ,
fema l e s and groups of people ) performing various actions . The varie ty of
responses given for two of these i tems are shown in Tables 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 . The
responses are ar ranged roughly in orde r , from those closest to the TT f o rms to
those c l o s e r t o English forms . These two tables represent the types of
re sponses for each i tem. The ages of the chi ldren tested ranged from 3 or 4
years (not many ) to 1 6 yea rs . The f igures in the columns represent the numbe r
of chil d ren giving that par t i cular response a t each of the three s e t t l ement s ,
Pularumpi ( Pi ) , Nguiu ( Ng ) and Mil ikapi t i (Mi ) . The age range of the chi ldren
g iving each res ponse is noted in parenthe s e s for each i tem. For ins tance , f rom
Table 4 . 1 , f our children f rom 1 2 years to 14 years gave the TT form
�pirimajirripi for ' she is s leeping/ lying down ' .
          The t e s t i s classed a s formal e l i ci ta t i on because the response s we re
e l i c i ted in a fo rmal si tua tion (normally at schoo l ) .        I have found that in
spontaneous speech even fewe r forms approxima t ing TT forms are used , with
children using more English loan verbs for f ree verb forms ( normally without an
auxi l i a r y ) than in formally e l i c ited mate ria l . From the tables i t can be seen
that the maj o r i t y o f children gave the forms with a free form ve rb , an Eng l i sh
loan verb in mos t cases . 7

         The normal way of forming a negative in MT is by inse r t i ng the negat i ve
particle kalu (wu ) ( TT : karluwu ) . Thi s form ( an Iwa idj a loan) i s used more
often than the form anuka ( f rom the trad i tional form arnuka ) , though this
l a t t e r is used by some . Whe re the negat ive occurs with an inflected
independent verb or a verbal complex there i s generally no subj unct i ve or
irrealis prefixes on the verb a s in TT ( see 4 . 2 . 9 . 2 , p . 1 98 ) , except in s ome

The choice of suffix may be seen to be phonologically determined in mo s t case s ,
the suffix -awa occur ring when the f inal consonant of the s tem i s an alveolar ,
and the suf f i x -ila occurring when the f inal consonant of the stem is any other

func t i on to the English fo rms ' mysel f ' , 'yoursel f ' , e t c . ( 1 9 7 4 : 55 ) . This i s
true to a c e r t a i n extent b u t the i r semantic range is rathe r dif fe rent f r o m the

o f ten conveyed the sense o f ' power ' , particularly with the third person minimal
f orms ; for instance , ngatawa mapurtiti i s o f ten used to mean ' t he powe rful
s p i ri t ' , meaning ' Satan ' . She sugge s t s that ori ginally the re we re two s e t s of
emphatic pronouns , one with the suffix -awa , poss ibly with the meaning of
' powe r ' or ' impo rtance ' and the other with the suffix -ila , with the sense o f
'exc lus i on of others ' . The se two sets have ama�gamated i n t o the one set but
the two meanings are re taine d , some t ime s with one meaning in f ocus and
some t i mes with the othe r . I n some cases the meanings seem t o b e re l a ted .             Thi s
seems a f e a s i ble sugge s t ion because , although the form wutila does not occur
a lone a s an empha t i c pronoun for third person augmented , i t does o ccur as the
base for othe r pronouns bui l t on the emphatic pronoun , such as the ref lexive ,
wutilamiya , ' themselve s ' ( see 3 . 3 . 2 . 4 ) . Some examples of the use of the se
pronouns are given below and the two senses d i s cussed above can be seen in some

2.4      IRFLDKHCK OF ENGLISH OR MODERN TIWI PHOROLOGY       The influence of English upon the Tiwi sound sys tem is similar to the
inf luence of English on Creole , de scribed by Sandefu r . As he points out , when
English f i r s t came into contact with Abor iginal language s , English words
borrowed ' were pronounced by Aboriginal speakers in terms of the sound systems
of the i r own' language ( Sandefur 1 97 9 : 2 9 f f ) . As t ime went on Creole ( o r
pidgin at thi s stage ) was influenced i n turn b y Engl ish , but thi s inf luence has
been in s tage s , result ing in a continuum of sounds . He says that the ' AL
[ Aboriginal Language s ] sounds that had replaced the English sound s in the
f orma t ive s tages of Creole began to return to or level toward the original
English sound s . ' ( Sandefur 1 97 9 : 42 )       This levell ing process i s apparent in the Tiwi situa t ion . Although the
language spoken by the young people cannot be regarded as an Engli sh-based
creole ( or pidg in) , it is certainly more heavily influenced by English than
tha t of the older people . Some young people ' s Tiwi is more influenced by
English than that of other young people . The situat ion port rayed in thi s
section shows a wid e range of data , collected f rom a large number of
individuals and theref ore much variation and f luctuat ion i s apparent . If only
one individual had been considered there would not be such dive r s i ty as
ind i cated .","[56, 57]"
"2 4 . By a q u i rk of fate the changed form , awa of the TT pronoun , ngawa 'we , us ,
      our' corresponds in pronunc iat ion to the Eng l i sh 'our ' . Since chi ld ren
      seem to learn some case forms of the English pronominal system relatively
      early , it i s probably the English form meant here .",[370]
"         Thi s may have been the case . Howeve r , there is ano ther possible
explanat ion which seems to correlate with the age div i s ion be tween MT and LTT
speakers . During the t ime of Father Gse l l ( 1 9 1 1 - 1 9 3 8 ) communi cation with the
olde r people was in Pidgin English ( see 8 . 2 . 1 , p . 3 2 7 ) . Father McGrath , who
took over from Father Gse l l , apparently had a very good command of Tiwi and
the re was l i t t l e need for the older people to speak F.ngli s h , 65 though it was
s t i l l t aught to the child ren in school . When Father McGrath l e f t in 1 948 ,
356
the re would probably have been a break in communication with the older people .
I t is my be l i e f tha t , rathe r than reve rt ing to us ing a form of pidgin Eng l i s h 66
in which t o communicate to the older people , the remaining staff ( only a few) ,
in emulat ing Father McGrath , spoke Tiwi to them.           ( Most mi ss ion staff have
a lways se emed to pick up and use s ome Tiwi , mainly common words ) . Howeve r ,
because of the lack of con t rol of the language by mos t of them this would have
been a very much reduced form , with perhaps the use of Engli sh verbs rather
than the complex Tiwi one s . I n turn , the older Tiwi may have used a ' f ore igner
talk' Tiwi to the mis si on staff , again with some Engl ish verbs . Thi s may have
come to form the basis of a BT form , which adu l t s may have begun using with
chi ldren , possibly to make the i r entry into school easier or perhaps j us t to
make i t e a s i e r to communicate with the children who had been inf luenced by
Eng l i s h . The ' f o r e i gner talk' Tiwi may have been based upon a pre-exi s t ing BT
form.","[363, 364]"

of the pref ixing l anguages of northern Austra l i a . Following McKay's scheme the
pe rsonal pronouns can be ar ranged ai ....minima ! ' versus ' augmented ' , whe re the
minimal categories are :          1         [+ speake r ,    - addressee )              'I'
          1/2       [+ speake r ,    + addre s see )            'you ( s g ) and I '

          3         [ - speake r ,   - addre s s e e )          'he / she '     If one or more persons is added to each of those in the minimal set above ,
an augmented set i s forme d , so that the minima l s e t can be rega rded as ' -othe r '

demons t r a t ives and defini t ives ) are only used for humans , though the re are some

also a number of phoneme s which do no t correspond . In borrowing words f rom
Engl ish , older people gene rally f i t them into the TT phonological sys tem , even
though they may pronounce the words wi th their English phonemes ( or close
approximations to them) when speaking English . Non-Tiwi sounds are changed
into the closest Tiwi sound . Fricatives become s tops , such a s : f , v become p ;
s , z , s , � , t � and d � become I � I ( [ i] o r [ � ] depending usually upon the

nature of language and how the se apply in relat i on to language change ,
comparing the change apparent in language acqui s i t i on , historical change and
change in contact s i tua tions . He presents four basic 'ground rule s ' to which a
communicative system must adhere i f it is to func t ion as a 'full-f ledged human
language ' ( S lobin 1 9 7 7 : 1 8 6 ) . These f our ' charge s ' are :
        ( i ) Be clear ( s ta ted previously as one of Slobin's ope rating principles of
chi ld language : 'Underlying semantic relations should be marked ove r t l y and
clearly' ( Slobin 1 9 7 3 » .
        ( i i ) Be humanly proce s sible in ongoing time , meaning that ' language must
conform to s t rategie s of speech percept ion and production' ( Slobin 1 9 7 7 : 1 86 ) .
        ( ii i ) Be quick and easy , relating to the human propens i ty to ' cut corne r s
( 197 7 : 187 ) .
        ( iv ) Be expres s ive , in�luding two important aspect s : seman t i c and
rhe t orical . A fully expres sive language needs to be able to encode a wide
range of seman t i c no t i ons and must also be able to be used for more than j us t
conveying l ogical propo s i t i ons and referential informat ion.        It needs t o

casual speech . Modern Tiwi contains a large number of English loans , verbs as

of Tiwi used , the closer the form is to tradit ional phonology. For ins t ance ,
