     Content Question
     Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³.
     who       that arrive
     Who is it that has arrived?
The first question above is a yes-no question. A speaker asks a yes-no question to find out if the
information in the question is true or not. When the speaker asks a yes-no question, he wants the
hearer to confirm or deny the information in the question. In the example above, the speaker is
not sure whether the the plane is coming or not.
The second question above is an example of a content question. Content questions are who,
what, when, where, why, how questions. The speaker asks a content question when he doesn't
know some specific bit of information in the sentence. In the Iau content question in (2) above,
the speaker doesn't know the identity of the subject so he asks the hearer,""Who is it that arrived?""
The question word `who' is underlined in example (2) above. Each of the two kinds of questions
in Iau will be discussed in detail in the following sections.","[109, 110]"
"
The other tones on verbs, 6, 2, and 8 do not change when a yes-no question marker is added.
Different tones are used on the sentence final question marker to show different degrees of
uncertainty on the part of the speaker. There are three different tones that can occur on a be yes-
no question marker. A tone 3 indicates that the speaker thinks the information in the question is                                                                                                  110
correct but he is not sure. All the previous examples in this section have had a tone 3 on the
question marker.
A tone 9 on the question marker means the speaker thinks the information in the question is
correct and doesn't expect the hearer to correct him. However, he does want the hearer to answer
him. This kind of question can occur in an interview or a teaching situation where the speaker is
trying to get the hearer to give him a yes answer. The following question is an example.
     Dy⁴be⁷ a⁴ a⁷se⁹       ui⁸ bv⁸ tv⁹       be⁹?
      then father already house to go away ?-Certain
     So then, father went home?
The speaker in the example above knows that father has gone home but he wants the hearer to
say it.","[110, 111]"

The Tone Morphemes on the Yes-No Question Marker
Yes-No Questions in Iau are marked by the unstressed particle be with one of three different tone
morphemes. The tone morphemes vary according to the degree of input that the speaker feels he
needs from the hearer, and also how certain the speaker is that his information is correct. The
table below displays the meanings of the 3 tone morphemes occuring on the be question marker.
         Degree of Anticipated Hearer Input
               None Possible Highly Probable
               9      3          4
               NI     PI         HPI
The use of the tone 9 morpheme indicates that the speaker is relatively certain that the
information content of the question is correct. The speaker does not anticipate any significant
information content input from the hearer. The following sentence illustrates the use of tone 9 on
a Yes-No Question Marker in Iau.
     A⁴      ty⁷   Bi⁷e⁹ a⁷se⁹ u⁶       di⁹             be⁹
     father person Bie SeqMkr before kill-TOT.PUN ?Mkr-NI
     So the people from Bie first killed father, right?
The speaker in the example above is using the question to prompt the hearer to retell a story
about an enemy raid. The speaker already knows that the information content of the question is
correct since he got the information from the hearer previously. He wants the speaker to answer
the question `Yes' and then begin to tell the story.
 A tone 3 morpheme is used on a Yes-No Question Marker when the speaker has reason to
believe that the information is correct but feels he needs input /confirmation from the hearer.
This is the most common tone occurring on the Yes-No Question Marker. The following
sentence is an example.
     Fv⁷      ba⁷              be³?
      Plane come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-PI
     Is the plane coming?
In the example above, the speaker thinks the plane may be coming and he is asking the hearer for
either confirmation or denial.
The tone 4 morpheme is used on the Yes-No Question Marker to indicatethat the speaker is not
at all sure of the information content of the question. The following is an example from a
conversational text.",[56]
"9.1 Questions In Iau
Questions are used in Iau mainly to get information from the hearer that the speaker does not
know. Rhetorical questions exist, but are used mainly for scolding, not for topic introduction.
There are two kinds of questions in Iau: yes-no questions and content questions. An example of
each kind of question is given below. The bolded words are the question markers.
    Yes-No
    Fv⁷     ba⁷    ba³?
     plane come ?-UnCertain
    Is the plane coming?",[109]
"The following is an example of tone 9 on a negative:
         Negative FACT: `did not, will not, is not, do not'
         Di⁹ to⁶ ba³tu³ sa⁸         ae⁹ ba³?
         2s Contr corn eat-RES.DUR Neg-FACT Uncer-RS.SA
         You do not eat corn do you?
The sentence about is a yes no question where the assumed answer is “No”. The negative
proposition “you do not eat corn” is viewed as fact by the speaker, as indicated by the tone 9
marking on the negative. The yes-no question particle gives the person the option of refuting or
clarifying the assumed fact.
Tone 9 can also occur on unbounded habitual or general truth statements

        When we go wild pig hunting, then we take along         a bow.",[46]
"9.1.2 What Questions
The four what question words in Iau are listed below.
     te⁸de⁹ what? (predicate form)
     te⁸du⁷ what thing?
     /te⁸du⁷be⁷
     te⁸be⁸de⁷ what kind of? (from where?,
      which place?)
     te⁸ (o⁷su⁹) de⁹ what kind of (leaf)?
     te⁸ (bi⁸) du⁸ what kind of (news)? (Content)
The question te⁸de⁹ is the predicate form of the `what' question word in Iau. It consists of the
question word te⁸ `what' and the stative particle de⁹. The following question and answer set
illustrates the use of the question word te⁸de⁹.
     Bv⁷ te⁸de⁹?
      this what
     What is this?",[112]
"
9.1.1 Yes-No Questions in Iau
Yes-no questions are formed in Iau by adding a yes-no question marker be or ba, which can be
used interchangeably, and by changing the tone on the verb stem according to the verb class
requirements.. In the example below, the first sentence is a simple statement. The second
sentence is a yes-no question formed from this statement.
    1.Au⁷ du⁹     bv⁸ i⁹.
     he wild pig for go
    He went hunting. (Lit. He went to get a wild pig.)
    2.Au⁷ du⁹     bv⁸ i⁷ ba³?
     he wild pig for go ?-Uncertain
    Did he go hunting?
The bolded words in the second sentence above illustrate the changes used in Iau to form a yes-
no question. The question marker ba³ is added to indicate that the speaker thinks it is true that the
man has gone hunting, but he is not sure. The example above also illustrates how the tone is
changed on tone 9 verbs in yes-no questions. A tone 9 (high level tone) is changed to a tone 7
(high rising tone). In the sentences above i⁹ becomes i⁷.
 The following pairs of sentences show the tone changes for tone 3 verbs and tone 5 verbs. The
tone 3, low falling tone, is changed to a tone 8, low level tone. A tone 5 high low falling tone is
changed to a tone 4 high falling verb in the question form.
    1. Tone 3 change to tone 8
    Au⁷ fv⁷ da⁸ du³.
    he plane carry go along
    He flies the plane.
    Au⁷ fv⁷    da⁸ du⁸         ba³?
    he plane carry go along ?-Uncertain
    Does he fly the plane?",[110]
"10.1.2 Tone 3: Speaker Responding
A tone 3 on a statement particle indicates that the speaker is not trying to control the information
about the topic. The tone 3 occurs frequently on answers to questions. The speaker uses the tone
3 to indicate that he is not trying to control the conversation but is responding with the requested
information. The use of a tone 3 also indicates that the information in the statement is about the
topic. The following sentence is an example.
     A. Fv⁷      da⁸su⁶    ba⁷                ba³?
         plane tomorrow come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-PI
     Is the plane coming tomorrow?
     B. Di⁹y³. Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶ ba⁹ a⁹                            y³
      yes plane tomorrow come-TOT.PUN DUbd-FACT Info-SNC.A.DT
     Yes, the plane is coming tomorrow.
In the example above, the second speaker marks his answer to the question with a tone 3 to
indicate that it is a response to the first speaker's lead.
A tone 3 is also used on statement particles to mark additional comments that a speaker may
want to make on an already introduced topic. The following statement is an example.
    Ay⁸ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ fv⁷ doe⁷               ae³      se⁹         dy⁴    a³             y³.

    DT
    Yes, Benjamin had never seen a plane before so he acted like that.
The statement above is an excerpt from a conversation about riding in a plane for the first time.
The speaker is offering the statement above as an additional comment on the topic of how
Benjamin reacted to the plane ride.",[125]

                  Meaning of Tone Morphemes on Statement Mood Particles
Tone 9 in the first column of the chart above indicates that the Speaker considers himself to be
the participnt controlling the discourse topic and the information about discourse topic.
Furthurmore, tone 9 on a statement mood particle indicates that the speaker is asserting the
information as nuclear or core information about the discourse topic.
 Statements marked by tone 9 are used in conversational discourse on answers that challenge the
information content of the question or answers that assert the speakers control of information
unknown to the hearer. The following sentence is an example.
     Dy⁴ so⁶      to⁷ba⁷    de⁹?
     then child how many Sta-FACT
     Spkr 1 And how many children does he have?
     So⁶ ai⁶                 y⁹.
     child Neg-RES.DUR Info-SC.A.DT
     He has no children.
In the example above, Speaker B uses a tone 9 on the statement mood particle y to indicate that
he intends to challenge the basic assumption of Speaker A and assert contrastive information
about the discourse topic.
 In contrast to tone 9 in the first column of the chart above, tones 3 and 8 in the second column
indicate that the speaker does not control discourse topic or the flow of information about
discourse topic. The information content of the statement, however, is being asserted about
discourse topic. Most answers to questions in Iau are marked by a tone 3 on the statement mood
particle as illustrated by the following example.
     Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶      ba⁷               ba³?
     plane tomorrow come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-PI
     Spkr 1Is the plane coming tomorrow?
     Di⁹y³. Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶ ba⁹                 a⁹         y³.
     yes plane tomorrow come-TOT.PUN DUbd-FACT Info-SNC.A.DT
     Spkr 2 Yes, the plane is coming tomorrow.
In the example above Speaker 1 marks hi2answer to Speaker A's question with a noncontrolling
tone 3 morpheme. The tone 3 morpheme indicates that while Speaker 2 is asserting the
information in the statement about discourse topic, he is not the participant who is controlling
discourse topic or the flow of information about discourse topic. He is responding to Speaker 1
by providing the requested information.
Tone 3 morphemes can also be used on statements that give furthur information on an already
introduced topic as illustrated in the following example.

The `what' question word te⁸du⁷ consists of the question particle te⁸ and du⁷ a left dislocation as
focus info particle. Te⁸du⁷ is used to ask about the identity of a thing when it is new information
placed in a left dislocated topic position. Normally information in this position would be already
given, not new predicated information. This is in contrast to the previous form te⁸de⁹ which is
used as a predicate in the sentence, the normal location for new predicated information. The
following are some examples.
     1.Bv⁷ te⁸du⁷ du⁷be⁷ ba³?
      this what that come
     What is this that is coming?
     Bv⁷ da⁷ du⁷be⁷ ba³.
      this dog that come
     It's a dog that is coming.
     2.Di⁹ te⁸du⁷ bv⁸ i⁹ a³?
      you what for go Pres Prog
     What (thing) are you going for?
     A⁹ du⁹       bv⁸ i⁹ a³.
      I wild pig for go Pres Prog
     I am going to get a wild pig.
The te⁸du⁷ form of the `what' question word is a abbreviated version of the question markerr
te⁸du⁷be⁷. There are two examples below.
     1.Te⁸du⁷be⁷ di⁹ be⁷   da⁸ bi⁶?
      what      you NMkr carry arrive
     What kind of thing did you bring?
     2.Au⁷ te⁸du⁷be⁷ di³?
      he what        kill
     What kind of thing did he kill?
The question word te⁸be⁸de⁷ means `what kind of/from where' and is usually used in reference to
people to ask what group or race they belong to. It is a description question word. (See also the
section on `Where Questions.) The following question and answer set is an example.
    Ty⁷      te⁸be⁸de⁷ fi⁹su³ o⁷su⁹ davy⁹ a³.
     person what kind pandanus leaf make Habit
    What kind of people make pandanus leaf mats?
    Ty⁷     Da⁸di⁷ fi⁹su³ o⁷su⁹ davy⁹ a³.
     person Dani pandanus leaf make Habit
    The Danis make pandanus leaf fishing mats.
When the generic term is known but the specific identity of the item is unknown, the following
construction is used in Iau to ask about the identity of the item.
    Bv⁷ te⁸ o⁷su⁹ de⁴?
    this what leaf is
    What kind of leaf is this?","[112, 113]"
"9.1.4 Which Questions
`Which' questions are asked when the speaker has a choice of several items. The speaker uses a
`which' question word to get information about the identifying characteristics or the identifying
location of the item. `Which' questions in Iau are marked by the question words te⁸bai⁵,
tebai⁵de⁸dv⁷ or te⁸be⁸de⁷. The following are some examples of `which' questions in Iau.
    1.Bv⁸ku⁷ te⁸bai⁵de⁸dv⁷ a⁹ sy⁹ o⁷ bv³?

    Which book should I take?
    Bv⁸ku⁷ bay⁴ be⁷ iy⁹.

9.2.1 Who /”Ty⁷⁻⁸’: questions about identity
Who questions are used when the normal focus item in the clause, the event, is known, but the
identity of the actor or agent for that event is unknown. The question word becomes the new
focus information about the topic, the rest of the clause.
There are two main `who' compound question words in Iau.
       ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴
       who? person identity marker
       ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
       who? agent as focus/new unknown information
 The word ‘boe⁴’ (identity marker) used in the example below is in a topic as predicate focus
type sentence where the new predicated information is on the left side of the clause and marked
by ‘du⁷be⁷’.
    Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³?       Si⁸a⁸da³ boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³.
     who ID that came           Janet ID Mkr that arrive
    Who is it that came? It's Janet that arrived.
    Ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴     du⁷be⁷ dui⁹       da⁹?      Epi boe⁴     du⁷be⁷ dui⁹    da⁹.
     who ID Mkr that w.pig-by bitten Epi Iden Mkr that w.pig-by bitten
    It was Epi who was bitten by a wild pig.
The question word with the boe⁴ identity particle can also be used when the `who' question word
occurs in the normal predicate position as illustrated below.
     Ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴?
      this who     ID mkr
     Who is this?
     A⁹ boe⁴ y³.
      I Iden Mkr Statement Mkr
     It's me.
As indicated above, the question word ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ `who' and the
identity marker boe⁴. The particle boe⁴ is used to mark statements of personal identity. The use of
the personal identity marker boe is also used to mark the identity information in the answers to
the questions in the illustrations above.
The question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ and the noun marker be⁸. Be⁸
marks nouns or noun phrases within the clause when they are focus, predicated information. The
tone morpheme 8 marks them as causative agent The following is an example of the use of the
content question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸.
     Da⁷ ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸           di³?
     This dog, who NMkFocus/Ag killed (it)?
     Who killed this dog?
In the question above the question word `who' uses the noun marker be⁸ because the person the
speaker wants to know about is also the one who brought about the action. That is the speaker
wants to know who acted on the dog and brought about his death.","[111, 112]"
"The sentence below is the answer to the question “What are you making that net for?”

"9.2 Iau Content Questions
Content questions are used to obtain unknown information as illustrated in the following
dialogues.
    Du       -i⁸ da -e⁹       bv⁸        bi⁸ taui⁷-e⁹    ba⁹

    Au⁷ to⁴           be⁸du⁷ dui⁹          da⁹? Da⁷ da⁸  i⁷ be⁸du⁷ dui⁹      da⁹?
    He what happened when wild pig –by bite? Dog carry go when wild pig-by bite.
    What was he doing when he got attacked by pig? (be⁸du⁷ interruption in expected flow of
    event)? He was taking his dog out hunting when he was attacked by a pig.
Note that in the examples above, most of the information in the clause is already known /given.
The unknown item indicated by the question becomes the focus, that is the new predicated
information about the topicwhich is the given part of the clause.
The following is a list of content question words in Iau.
    ty⁷⁻⁸              who? (Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ or Ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸)
    te⁸de⁹             what?
    te⁸du⁷ /te⁸du⁷be⁷  what?
    te⁸be⁸de⁷          what kind of? (class identity of the thing)
    te⁸ --- de⁹        What kind of? (specific name of a generic item)
    te⁸bai⁵de⁸dv⁷       which one?
    te⁸ /te⁸be⁷        where?, what place?
    te⁷bv⁹             why?, for what purpose?

                        /what do you say /call –(person/thing)- ?
In general, te⁸ means `what' or `where', ty⁷⁻⁸ means `who' and to⁴ refers to questions about events
‘what happened?’. The other syllables on the end of the question words are various noun and
verb markers which identify the function of the word in the sentence as well as it’s focus status..
Each of the types of question words will be discussed below.",[111]

     Where is the path are they going on?
In the examples above there are several different choices of locations. The `which' question word
te⁸bai⁵ or tebai⁵de⁸dv⁷ is used in situations where the speaker has all of the specific choices in
front of him and wants the hearer to point out which of these choices he is referring to. The
`which' question word te⁸be⁸de⁷ is used when the speaker knows there are several possible
locations but does not know where they all are. For example in (3) above he can't see the place
where the path is and so he asks the hearer to point it out for him.
‘Which’ question words can also be used to ask about the source location of something, ie which
place it is from. The following are some examples.
    1.Di⁹ a⁵ te⁸bai⁴de⁸de⁷?

"Mood Particles Eliciting a Response from the Hearer.
There are 7 segmental mood particles which mark propositions which the speaker is using to
elicit a response from the hearer. They are listed below. Syllables with tone variants do not have
a tone on them in the list below
       be/ba (Unstressed) Yes-No Question Marker (?Mkr)
       asy Directs the hearer's attention to something (Attn)
       bv Request permission /instruction /action (Rq)
       dy Imperative (Imp)
       dy⁴da Emphatic /Repeated Imperative (EImp)
       day Prohibition (PRoh)The unstressed be/ba marker is used to mark yes-no questions in which the speaker is trying to
elicit certain information as a response from the hearer. The following is an example.
     Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶       ba⁷              ba³?
      plane tomorrow come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-RS.SA
     Is the plane coming tomorrow?
The particle asy which occurs with several tone variations, is used to direct the speaker's
attention to something. The following sentence is an example.
     Dai⁸dv⁹ doe⁷               a⁹sy⁹.
      butterfly see-TOT.INC Attn-NRS.SA
     Look at the butterflies!
The asy particle not only calls the speaker`s attention to something but also has the connotation
that the speaker anticipates it is highly relevant or of interest to the hearer.
The bv particle marks requests for permission and also requests for the hearer to instruct the
speaker on what the hearer wants the speaker to do. The bv particle is illustrated below.
    A⁹ i⁷         bv³?
    1S go-TOT.INC Req-RS.SA

     Someone may have stolen it, I don't know.
The y particle often marks the answer to a question as illustrated in the first example above. In
the second example the speaker is giving further information about discourse topic `Where is my
axe' which is marked by the particle y.",[52]
"
                                                                                                   115
(For a discussion of the event question word ‘to⁴’ See that section 9.1.10 below.)9.1.6 How Questions
`How' questions are used to elicit procedures. The basic `how' question word in Iau is either
te⁸dau⁴ or te⁸fau⁴. These two question words appear to be interchangeable. The event question
word to⁴ can also be used in Iau to elicit either descriptions or demonstrations of the procedure
for using something. The following are some examples of `how' questions in Iau.
    1.Da⁹ du⁹      bv⁸ du⁸          e⁹   da⁹ te⁸dau⁴ de⁷     du⁹     bv⁸ du³?

"9.1.7 When Questions
When questions about the time of an event are asked, the `when' question word to⁶ is place in the
time slot in the clause. The following questions are examples of the use of the time question
word to⁶ in Iau.
    Di⁹ u⁸ to⁶ ba⁷               se⁹          i⁹           a⁴?

    You going (now, )when (Lit day when?) do you intend to come back?",[116]
"9.1.5 Why Questions
`Why' questions in Iau can mean either `for what reason?' or `for what purpose'. The following
are some examples.
    1.Fv⁷ te⁷bv⁹ ba⁷ ae⁷ da³?
     plane why come not Reported Speech
    Why didn't the plane come, as it was supposed to?
    2.Di⁹ te⁷bv⁹ ta⁸ dai⁷si⁹ da⁸ i⁹ a³?
     you why machete hold carry to Pres Prog
    Why are you carrying that machete?
The first example above illustrates a why question word te⁷bv⁹ to ask `for what reason?' The
second example above illustrates the use of the question word te⁷bv⁹ to ask `for what purpose?'.
 In Iau `why' questions are frequently used as rhetorical questions to indicate that the speaker
feels that the situation never should have happened. The following is an example.
    A⁹ te⁷bv⁹ bv⁸ bei⁷ ae⁷ da³?
    1s why for stay-TOT.INC Neg-HYP RpSp-RLZ

Reason and purpose questions can be disambiguated by using a complex multi-clause sentence
structure.",[115]
"10.0 SPEAKER VIEWPOINT & IT’S DISCOURSE IMPLICATIONS10.1 Conversational Control
According to Longacre (1976), conversational exchanges between speakers can be thought of as
a game in which each speaker either tries to take control of the conversation on his terms or
submits to the terms of the other speaker. For example, when a speaker gives an answer to a
question he is submitting to the terms of the previous speaker by providing the requested
information. This is a very useful idea when analysing the meaning of particles that occur in the
discourse genre, dialogue.",[124]
"9.1.8 Quantity Questions (How Many?)
The Iau question word to⁸ba⁴de⁷ `how many' is used to ask about the quantity of an item. The
following question is an example of an Iau quantity question.
    U⁸    to⁸ba⁴de⁷ sa⁸ ai⁵si³toe⁶ a⁹?

"9.1 Simple Commands
A simple command in Iau is formed by adding the command particle dy³ following the verb and
by changing the verb stem tone. The following command is an example.
     1.I⁷            dy³.
       go-TOT.INC Imp-SA.RS
     Go!
The verb i⁹ `to go' usually has a tone 9 on it. In commands, just like yes-no questions, the tone 9
is changed to a tone 7. Tone 7 means that the action is either incomplete or that it has not
happened yet. Tone 5 verbs change to a tone 4 and tone 3 verbs change to a tone 8. These tone
changes are illustrated in the commands below.
    1.Au⁷ foi⁴          dy³.

    A Mood Marker
    be Information in proposition is probably true, but speaker is uncertain
    be⁹ Yes-No Question Marker. speaker does not anticipate significant hearer input.
    Be³ Yes-No Question Marker. Speaker is not sure of information and expects /needs hearer
    input
    Be⁴ Yes-No Question Marker. Speaker is not sure of information content at all. He feels
    there is a high probability the hearer will correct him.
8.2.2 Tone Sequences
In addition to the eight basic levels and contours, there are 4 combinations of 2 tone sequences
that commonly occur on single syllables, The sequences ⁷⁻⁸ and ⁴⁻⁷ are the most common
sequences on verbs, adjectives and particles. The following are some examples.
       da⁸⁻⁴ mountain.
       sae⁶⁻⁴ machete
       Baui⁷⁻⁸(be⁷) three (Note ⁷⁻⁸ is a tonal variant of ⁷⁻³.)
       bui⁴⁻⁷ (se⁵) will cut down (intention marking particle)
The ⁴⁻⁷ sequence which occurs on telic verbs when combined with an intention indicating particle
is very common and easily elicited.
    Au⁷ u⁸ bui⁴⁻⁷ se⁵
    He is going/intending to cut down a tree
The ⁷⁻⁸ sequences occurs on particles, adjectives and verbs except in certain rare occurances on
some verbs, it can also be easily elicited.
       Baui⁷⁻⁸(be⁷) three       Dy⁴da⁸dv⁹ si⁶ av⁷bv⁹ be⁶di⁷ so⁶ fv³ty⁹ by⁷⁻⁸.

       And so his wife later gave birth to a boy child.","[6, 7]"
"9.1.3 Where Questions
Either the simple question word te⁸ or te⁸ plus the noun as focus marker be⁷ can be used to ask
the identity of a location. The following sentences are examples.
    1.Di⁹ te⁸           i⁹ a³?
     you what(place) go Pres Prog
    Where are you going?
    A⁹ bui²       i⁹ a⁹        y³.

    4.Di⁹ be⁶ te⁸be⁷ kui⁹ fvy⁷ se⁵?

    Where are you going to cut the grass?
The `where' question words illustrated above are the words used when the speaker wants the
hearer to inform him of the location of something.
The following sentences illustrate the use of the question word te⁸be⁷ `where' to ask for the
source location of something.
    1.Di⁹ a⁵ te⁸be⁷ o⁸sy⁹ de⁷?
     2s land where from Stat
    Where do you come from?
    2.Di⁹ te⁸be⁷ bi³?
     2s where arrive
    Where did you come from?
The `where' question words te⁸ and te⁸be⁷ in Iau are not used in Iau in situations where the
speaker is using location to identify which of several objects is being discussed. These are
discussed in the following section on which question words.",[114]
"A tone 4 on the question marker means that the speaker is not at all sure that the information in
his question is correct. He thinks it is highly likely that the speker will correct him. The
following sentence is an example of tone 4 on a question marker.
     Da⁹ a² tv⁹ be⁴?
      you pl land-by go away ?-Vuncertain
     I guess you traveled by land?
In the question above the speaker has never been to the place they are talking about so he is just
guessing. This is indicated by the tone 4 marker be⁴.",[111]
"

    Did you go by land?
The sentence above is taken from a conversation about a trip to a new place. The speaker has
never been there and is asking about the place and the hearer's trip there. He marks his question
with the tone 4 morpheme to indicate that it is highly probable that the information content of his
question is not correct.","[56, 57]"
"
                                                                                                  42
The first sentence is a generic /gnomic truth question. It could also be considered habitual action
for that location. It is marked with the be particle because it refers to a period of time in the past,
and an action already realized multiple times within that time period.
The second sentence could be an answer to the question above but is actually taken from a
different conversation. The period of time being referred to is a definite, known time period,
“when I was up at Saita”. During this definite time period the event ‘eat pork’ happened
mulitiple times.
In the final sentence. be marks an action that was habitually done in the past but is no longer
done. It can be translated “used to .
The following is an example of be marking an event that just occurred but has now stopped. A
young boy and older man who has a bad headache are alone in the men’s house. The sick man
hears a very irritating knocking noise and asks what that is? The following is the boy’s answer.
        A⁹ i⁶ du⁷be⁷ u⁸ fui⁴                be⁸            iy³.

"The participants in the conversation above are discussing the marriage status of various people in
the village. Speaker 2 is surprised that a certain girl is still unmarried. Speaker 1 explains that
their custom is to wait until the girls are a little older. Speaker 2 in the sentnece above then offers
a contrastive statement that in his village, the girl would have already been married. The
contrastive statement giving furthur information is marked by tone 9.
The tone 8 morpheme is also speaker non controlling. In addition, the tone 8 morpheme indicates
that the information in the proposition is of immediate contextual relevence. The following
sentence is an example.
     A⁹ a⁵ taui⁷               sa⁹        y⁸.
      1S land work-TOT.INC Int-FACT Info-SNC.A.CR
     I am going now to work in my garden.
The sentence above is taken from a conversation about what each participant is doing. The
example above is the answer to the question, `What are you going to do?' In the discourse
context, the speaker is on his way to the garden. The information in the statement is of
immediate relevence in the discourse situation since the speaker is currently engaged in bringing
the action about.
 The tones in the final column of the chart above, tones 7 and 4, are also speaker noncontrolling.
Tones 7 and 4 also tend to mark responses such as answers and furthur remarks or opinions.
Tones 7 and 4 contrast in that tone 7 marks statements whose information content is directly
about the discourse topic while tone 4 marks statements when the information is not directly
about the discourse topic.
The following is an example of a tone 7 morpheme on a statement.
    So⁷ fi⁴au⁷ be⁸ be⁹?
    tree Inten tall ?Mkr-NI
    Spkr 1And the So tree very tall?
     BY⁶! to²⁻⁷ ae⁷.                               Ba⁹ tv⁹                   dv⁹ y⁷?
     Exclam do what-TEL.DUR.CHS Neg-HYP here go away-TOT.PUN (?) Info-SNC.NA.DT
     Spkr 2 You are not kidding! It was way up there!
Many occurrences of tone 7, like the example above, are on highly idiomatic verb phrases. The
question mark glossing the particle dv is used to indicate that the exact meaning of the particle is
unknown. The general meaning of the statements is clear from the context and discussions with
native speakers. In the example above, the speaker is giving a highly emotive response to
Speaker 1's question. Speaker 2 uses the tone 7 morpheme to indicate that the fact that the tree
was tall should not even have been called into question.
 Tone 4 morphemes mark statements that have backgrounding functions in the discourse. The
information content of the statement marked by tone 4 is peripheral not nuclear to the discourse
topic, ie it is not directly related to the discourse topic. The following example illustrates tone 4
marking information that is not directly about the discourse topic.",[60]
"The example is about a frustrated action. The question being answered it. Was it a fact that you
were about to kill the pig yesterday but you were interrupted. The speaker uses the final particle
dy⁵ with a tone 5 non present fact marker. It was indeed a fact yesterday, but no longer is true
that he is going to kill the pig.
By far the most common occurence for the tone 5 epistemic modality morpheme is on the
intention particle se⁵. It is the most common tone on statements of intention.

"10.2 Responses And Exclamations
Iau has a variety of particles used to indicate positive and negative responses. The following is a
list of positive response particles and their meanings.
    di⁴ to³ Yes, of course that's right.
    di⁴ y³ Yes, that's right.
    di⁴ da⁷by⁹ Yes, didn't you know that?
    di⁴ be⁷de⁷ to⁴ Yes, that must be right /Yes, that seems right.
    e⁸fe⁹ Yes, that's right.
    by⁷by⁹ That's true. /That's the way it is.
    ay⁸ Yes, I will; Yes, I understand; Okay
    dy⁴ dy³ Yes, you go ahead and do that.
The following is a list of negative response particles used in Iau and their meanings.
    Bai⁶e³ No, that's not right; No, I won't.
    Ba⁶⁻³ No; Well, actually....
    bav⁵ I don't know.
The final group of response particles listed below are used to express the speaker's feelings in
response to a given situation.
    Y⁶!`expresses displeasure'
    Y⁵! `expresses need to comply with speaker opinion /proposal'
    Ai⁶av²! `a lament, response to something negative'
    Y⁹v⁶ ` Oh!Oh! ('A⁹ bai⁸si⁷ to⁹’ I slipped/fell)
The exclamation y⁶! indicates displeasure over something that has happened. It is heard
frequently in the village when an owner returns to find that a dog has eaten his food, or when a
child has gotten into mischief. The speaker uses the particle y⁶ to announce and assert his
displeasure to the community at large.
 The exclamation particle y⁵ emphatically emphasizes the speaker's viewpoint or the need for the
action he is proposing. The following is an example taken from a conversation between a health
worker and a villager reporting to the health worker about a man with a bad cut.
    A. Fi⁴au⁷ di⁸ be⁹ y⁴.

    Well then lift him up and bring him (here).
By using the particle y⁵, the speaker indicates that the situation requires action. The speaker takes
control of the conversation by ending the discussion of symptoms and changing the discussion to
what should be done about the problem.",[126]
"9.1.10 Event Questions

Any noun can be substituted in the position between the question word te⁸ and the stative particle
de⁴.
The `what' question particle te⁸ can also occur in the left dislocated position marked as new
information by the particles dv³, du⁸ or du⁷be⁷ to ask `what thing?'. These are illustrated in two
sample questions below.

illocutionary force.

The segmental mood particles that fill the mood/illocutionary force slot in Iau are used to
indicate the speakers intention regarding the information role of his proposition in the
conversational discourse.They have to do with speaker hearer relationship and intent towards
each other as well as the content of the proposition expressed. The intent may be to convey
information, opinion or assert a fact. It may be to ask for information or it may be to obligate
either speaker or hearer to action. A promise or statement of intent is used by the speakers to
obligate themselves. A command with various levels of mitigation of that command is an attempt
by the speaker to obligate the hearer. Following the mood slot is a slot used by the speaker to
convey that the information is or should be already known to the hearer. It is in effect an
intensifier of the command, promise or statement being made.","[50, 51]"

Following the classifiers are another group of modifiers, the specifiers. These particles specify
certain members of a class as opposed to others. Specifier particles are words like ‘another one,
some, or a different one’. The following are some examples in Iau.
       ty⁷                  a⁹              another person

The descriptive adjectives follow the classifier and specifier particles. The following noun phrase
is an example.
    Du⁹      a⁹       i⁸si⁴ba⁷

    a big wild-pig, another big wild-pigQuantifiers
The quantifiers follow the descriptive adjectives in Iau noun phrases as illustrated below.
    Du⁹      a⁹      i⁸si⁴ba⁷ bo⁴ be⁷
    wild pig another big      two
    Two other big pigsDemonstratives
Following the quantifiers in the noun phrase are the demonstrative adjectives such as `this' or
`that'. The ordering of the demonstrative adjectives after the quantifiers is illustrated below.
    Ty⁷      bo⁴ ba⁷bv⁹
    person two this
    these two peopleCase Marking Particles
The final particles in the Iau noun phrase are the optional particles which mark the case role of
the noun relative to discourse topic.The also mark the information in the noun phrase as
predicated information. For more information on predicated information see section 6.2 below
about pragmatic focus –presupposition and the Iau clause.
The following is a list of the focus/case marking particles in Iau.
    be⁷ /be⁴ /be⁸marks noun phrase as predicated information about the case role of noun relative
                 to discourse topic
    by⁷ same as be⁷ but refers to a specific item or individual known to the hearer
    di⁷ body part as instrument

The noun markers be and by are used to mark noun phrases when the noun phrase is part of the
new information that is being predicated about the topic. This is illustrated by the following
question and answer set.
    Kaf⁷ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸ taui⁷    di³?
    bow this   who TopCMkr make-TOT.INC PBd-RLZ
    Who made this bow?
    Das⁷⁻⁸ be⁸             taui⁷        di³.
    Das    TopCMkr         make-TOT.INC PBd-RLZ
    Das made it.
In the question and answer set above, the speaker and hearer are talking about a topic, a bow that
someone made. The new information that the questioner wants to know is: who made the bow. In
the example above the question word `who' and the name `Das' are both marked with the same
noun marker be⁸ to indicate that this noun and not the verb is the new information that is being
predicated about the topic, the bow.
The tone on these particles indicates the case role of the noun. The be and by noun markers have
three tone variants. The tone 8 variant be⁸ indicates that the marked noun is the causative agent
that acted on the topic noun. In the previous example Das was the one who acted on the bow and
made it. This is indicated by the tone 8 on the be⁸ case marker. The following sentence is an
another example.
       Ty⁷        bi⁷si⁹   a⁷se⁹  u⁶          bi⁸      be⁸           da⁸

       go-TOT.INC MVClMkr person SeqMkr all                 flee-TOT.DUR
       Someone had already taken the news before (we got there) and so they had all already
       fled.
The sentence above is answering the question `So you didn't actually kill any one on the raid?'
The answer is “No”. The reason is because of the news that had been carried to the people ahead
of time. The noun bi⁸ `news' is marked by the be⁸ particle as the cause of conversation topic, the
fact that they did not kill anyone.
When a tone 4 occurs on the topic case marker be⁴, it indicates that the noun is either acted on
by the topic or the noun is the instrument or means of acting on the topic. This is illustrated by
the following examples:
       1. Fi⁹     kae² be⁴         o⁹       a⁴.
          fish    net NMkr-Mns take-TOT.PUN            DUBd-URLZ
          Fish are caught by means of nets.
       2. Kae² fi⁹      be⁴ o⁹                     a⁴.
          net fish NMkr-Mns take TOT PUN           DUBd URLZ
          Nets are the means of catching fish.
In both sentences the relationship between fish and nets is the same. Nets are the means by which
the undergoer,`fish', is affected. The first sentence answers the question `What is used for
catching fish?' The second sentence answers the question `What are nets used for?'
The tone 7 variant be⁷ is used to mark nouns in clauses in which some other noun is the
predicated new information or it is used to mark nouns which are already partially known or
highly expected in the context. The following are some examples.
       1. To⁸     tai⁷ ba⁷bv⁹   By⁵ be⁷⁻⁸de³ U⁸du⁸ba⁸dvs⁹   bo⁴
          pig    leg this       Bih also     Udubadus(also) two
       a⁷se⁹      tai⁷ be⁷       o⁹.
       SeqMkr leg NMk take-TOT.PUN
       As for the pig's leg, both Bih and Udumadus grabbed it.
       2. Bv⁷     da⁷ du⁷be⁷ a⁹ be⁷           di³.
          this    dog that       SI NMkr      kill-TOT.DUR
         This is a dog that I killed.
The be noun markers will be discussed in more detail in a separate section below.
The first example above is taken from a portion of a text that is about catching a pig. The
narrator is telling which body part each of the participants grabbed in order to catch the pig. The
                                                                                                     63
fact that the participants grabbed onto a body part of the pig is highly expected in the context.
The be⁷ marker with a tone 7 marks the specific identity of the body part as highly expected. The
second example illustrates the use of a tone 7 on the be particle to mark a noun which is not the
new or unknown noun in the context. In (2) above, the hearer already knows that the speaker is
the one who killed the animal.
 The particle di⁷ is used in Iau to mark a body part which is used as an instrument. The following
is an example.
       Bo⁸de⁷    ty⁷      a⁷se⁹     e⁸ -di⁷       di³.
       ball      person SeqMkr foot -Instr        hit-TOT.DUR
       He kicked the ball with his foot.
The particles fe⁷ and fa⁷ are used interchangeably to mark a noun phrase as a benefactive. The
following sentence is an example.
       Ui⁸       e⁸` -fe⁷    davy⁷      dy³.
       house     me -Benef make-TOT.INC Imp
       Build a house for me.
The noun marker bv⁸ is used to indicate that the noun is the goal toward which an entity is
moving. The following are some examples.
       1. A⁹ ui⁸      bv⁸ i⁹.
          I house to go-TOT.PUN
          I am going to the house.
       2. A⁹ du⁹      bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸ i⁹.
          I wild pig for dog carry      go-TOT.PUN
          I took my dog hunting for wild pigs.
In the first example, bv⁸ marks the location toward which the moving object is moving. In the
second example bv⁸ marks the goal of the action, ie what the hunter is going to get.
The particle bv⁸ occurs alone without an associated noun when it refers back to the sentence
topic. The following is an example where the particle bv⁸ refers back to du⁹ `wild pig', the
sentence topic.
       Du⁹      ty⁷      a⁷se⁹     bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸      i⁹.
       wild pig person SeqMkr for dog carry         go-TOT.PUN
       They have taken the dogs to go hunting wild pigs.
The particle fi⁵ is used in Iau to mark a noun that was formerly the location or possessor of an
object, but another participant took it away from him. The particle fi⁵ marks an undergoer source.
the following is an example.
       Di⁹      a⁷se⁹    y⁸ fi⁵        vy⁸ be⁷⁻⁸   a⁷se⁹    ui⁸      bv⁸ i⁹.
       things   SeqMkr we from         take SClMkr SeqMkr house to go.TOT.PUN
       When they had taken our things from us, we went to the house.
In the example above fi⁵ marks the pronoun y⁸ `we' as the source from which the things were
taken.
Locative postpositions also occur noun phrase final. These will be discussed in Section 2.8.1
below.","[61, 62, 63, 64]"
"In the first example above, the speaker is refuting the basic underlying assumption that the
woman in question is married. The second example illustrates the use of the particle ‘to’ to
emphasize that Speaker 2's own experience in using goggles to catch fish is contrary to Speaker
1's who has never used them.
The particle ‘e’ is more rare than the other mood particles in conversational discourse. The ‘e’
particle is used on statements that the hearer is using to justify or explain his action. The
following segment of conversational discourse illustrates this.

The final sentence marked by the particle ‘e’ functions in the discourse context to give
information explaining why Speaker 1 came to Speaker 2 to ask him about corne.",[54]
"In the first sentence the pronoun a⁹ `I' is topic of the clause and is also the fronted NP. In
example 2 books the undergoer is the topic of the clause
When three or more nouns occur in a clause, they are ordered on a sliding scale of topicality and
definiteness. The topical nouns are placed to the left of nontopical nouns. Definite nouns preceed
indefinite nouns. The question and answer set illustrate this.
         1.Te⁸du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸   be⁸    da⁷ bv⁸ da⁸ tv³?
          what        Benjamin Cause dog for carry leave- TOT.DUR

         2.Dai³ du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ be⁸ bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸ tv⁹
          cassowary that Benjamin       for dog carry leave-TOT.PUN
          It was a cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.
         In each of the sentences above there are three participants involved in the action--
         Benjamin, the dog, and the animal being hunted. In the examples above, the ordering of
         the particle bv⁸ and the noun da⁷ `dog' is reversed. In (1) bv⁸ ‘goal’ occurs after the noun
         da⁷ and in (2) it occurs before `da⁷' dog.
 The first sentence is a question which asks for the identity of the animal being hunted. The
particle `bv⁸' `for (it)' refers to some unknown animal. The noun `da⁷' on the other hand refers to
a specific animal known to the speaker and hearer. Since the noun da⁷ `dog' is definite and the
animal referred to by the particle bv `for (it)' is indefinite, the speaker places the indefinite
particle bv⁸ to the right of the more definite noun da⁷.
In sentence (2) however the identity of the animal hunted is specified as a cassowary. In (2), the
particle bv⁸ now refers to a definite noun, dai³ `cassowary', which is also the sentence topic as
indicated by its position to the far left of the sentence. Because bv⁸ refers to a noun that is both
definite and topical it must preceed the noun da⁷ which is definite but not topical.
The following sentence is another example of a topical noun preceeding a less topical noun.
         Y⁸ da⁶ se⁸ko⁸da⁷ o⁷        da⁸dv⁹ bau⁶              da⁸dv⁹

"6.2.2.1 MARKING CLEFT CONSTRUCTIONS IN IAU
The equivalent of a cleft construction (It is “x” that ...) in Iau is composed of a noun marked by
formulaic particles in a topicalized position. The topicalized noun in a cleft construction is the
new predicated information in the clause, while the rest of the clause is the given /known
information. The cleft construction equivalent occurs in Iau in sentence initial position in topic
slot, is followed by slight pause. The topicalized item can be a noun, a noun phrase or a clause.

        Da⁷ by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ a⁹ be⁷         di³.
        dog that           I Nmkr kill-TOT.PUN
        It was a dog (not anything else) that I killed not anything else /another animal. (In
        contexts where there are other possibilities and the speaker is emphasizing this as the
        truth)
The cleft construction marking particles, du⁸/du³; du⁷be⁷ /du⁸be⁷; and by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ /by⁷by⁹ du⁷,
are all compounds of the particle du⁷/du⁸. The following are the meanings of the particle
components:
        du: identity is being asserted but in the topic rather than the predicate position
        dv: identity given /already known
        be: participant is known, already given but being asserted in clause
        by: info established as fact
The particles are listed below:
       du⁸ /du³ /du⁷ it’s when..., it’s ...that
       du⁷be⁷ / du⁸be⁷ it’s ...x... that does /is....
       by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ /by⁷by⁹ du⁷ it’s (only ) ...x.. that....
In narrative and procedural text, these markers occur most frequently in closing comments such
as the following where du⁷be⁷ marks two contrastive pig traps, the writer’s which caught a pig
and his older brother’s which did not. In the procedural text about making a wooden dish, the
marker appears in the closing summary which tells which two kinds of wood are the only
acceptable ones for making the dish.

"The example above is taken from a segment of conversational text about being afraid of riding in

                                                                                                   59
Benjamin held onto him the whole way because he was so afraid. The sentence in the example
above marked by tone 3 is a furthur comment on the topic of being afraid of riding in planes. The
sentence above provides information on one of the reasons that people are afraid when they ride
in planes.
 In contrast, furthur remarks that give contrastive information are not marked with a tone 3
noncontrolling morpheme but with a tone 9 speaker controlling tone morpheme instead. The
following example illustrates the use of tone 9 on a contrastive furthur remark.

"9.0 PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONS OF SENTENCES IN IAU DIALOGUE
In narrative discourse sentences function to give information, that is ,tell a story. In
conversational dialogue, sentences are used to get information from the other speaker (ask
questions), to give opinions /make statements of fact or to get the other speaker to do something
(commands). For more detail see section 10 below.",[109]
"The Mood Tone Morphemes
The illocutionary force of an utterance can be defined as the speech act that is performed by
uttering a given proposition. Lyons (1977:745) lists statements, commands and questions as
examples of utterances with differing illocutionary force. The illocutionary force of an utterance
in Iau is indicated by a combination of grammatical devices including modality particles,
sentence final segmental mood particles and the tone morphemes that occur on them.
 We have seen in the previous section that the Iau segmental mood particles indicate the intended
illocutionary force of the proposition. One set of particles marks sentences that give information
to the hearer. Another set of particles marks sentences whose role is to elicit a response from the
hearer.
 The tone morphemes which are superimposed on these segmental particles mark the dynamics
of the interchange between speaker and hearer. The tone morphemes indicate whether the
speaker is asserting the information as nuclear /core information about the discourse topic or not.
They also indicate which speaker in the conversation is controlling the discourse topic and the
flow of information about discourse topic. The tone morphemes on Iau mood particles have
differing meanings depending on the illocutionary force of the sentence on which they occur. In
the following sections we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on Yes-No Question
Markers. Then we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on directives. And finally
we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on statements.
The tone morphemes on the mood particles indicate the illocutionary force of the utterance, ie
how much response the speaker expects from the hearer and how forceful and immediate the
requirement is.
The following lists the illocutionary force meanings of the tone morphemes on these particles.
    3 =Assertive, expects response /or responding to previous speaker (RsA)
    8 =Assertive, expects /needs immediate response (IRsA)
    9 =Assertive, but does not expect response (NRsA)
    5 =Assertive, but expects hearer resistance, both hearer and
      speaker obligation (SHRsA)
    4 =Non-assertive, but expects response (RsNA)
    7 =Non-assertive, does not expect response or compliance (NRsNA)The following are some examples..",[55]
