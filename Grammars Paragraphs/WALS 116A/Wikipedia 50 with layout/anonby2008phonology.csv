The affirmative particle yó ‘indeed’ has the effect of affirming a clause or putting focus
on an Indicative clause constituent. When it is simply juxtaposed with a noun, a
presentational clause or an answer results.       kwéé yó                                    here is Kwe / it is Kwe
       Kwe indeedWith the exception of interrogative pronouns (6.2), sentences consisting of a single word
are not permitted; thus, in cases where a noun is used to answer a question—as shown by
the preceding example—it is always accompanied by yó.","[450, 451]"
"Most commonly, interrogative pronouns co-occur with the question particle nà
(10.1.2.1). If the interrogative pronoun is the subject of the clause, it comes in the usual
subject position (before the verbal complex; see 10.1.1) and the question particle comes
at the end of the clause.       víí  Ø      húmgò nà                   who comes? / who is coming?

If the interrogative pronoun and question particle are found alone in a clause, or if the
interrogative pronoun is found in clause-final position (e.g. as an object, adverbial
complement, or predicate nominal), the pronoun and question particle form a single

"2.1.4.1 The glottal stop in morpheme-initial position
The glottal stop poses interpretive challenges in morpheme-initial position as well as in
syllable rhymes. In morpheme-initial position, it is debatable whether or not the glottal
stop is a contrastive consonant or whether it is demarcative (that is, a predictable effect of
its morphological context); this question is posed in Anonby (2006:224) but is not
answered there. In syllable rhymes, the glottal stop could be interpreted as a consonant, a
vowel feature, or a feature associated with glottalic consonants that follow vowels. The
two issues are related, since positing contrast for the glottal stop in one position would
have consequences for the other position. The phonological status of the glottal stop in
morpheme-initial position is addressed in the present section, and its status elsewhere is
pursued in 2.3.3.3.",[64]
"Among these sources, the two articles which constitute important exceptions to a general
tendency of brevity and uncertainty are those of Eguchi (1971) and Hamm (2001). In his
Esquisse de la langue Mambaï, Eguchi expresses the hope that “ce rapport préliminaire,
sans doute plein de fautes dûes au manque d’investigation intensive, pourra être utile”
(1971:139). Eguchi’s study, while basic, has nonetheless been indispensable as a starting
point for the present investigation of Mambay. It provides concise background to the
language before presenting a brief phonology and morphology; these sections are
followed by the transcription and translation of a story as well as an 800-word lexicon.
Eguchi’s work raises a number of interesting questions on the language in the areas of
consonant and vowel inventory, alternations in tone, length and nasality, tone-consonant
interaction (p. 155) and the absence of tongue-root vowel harmony. Perhaps most
remarkable is his positing of nasal implosives (p. 144). This question is revisited in the
present research in 2.1.7.1.",[28]
"Four Indicative particles are found in Mambay:       nà      (question particle; see also 4.4.2.3)
       yó      (affirmative particle)
       yá      (negative particle)
       rè      (topicalization particle)Indicative particles are used in reference to clauses as well as clause constituents. Since
the core of a clause is prototypically a verb, applying a particle to a verbal clause is
formally and functionally equivalent to applying it to the verb (see 7.6.1.1 for examples).
In the following section, each of the Indicative particles is shown (whenever attested) in a
verbless clause, with an Indicative verb, and with at least one other clause constituent.",[450]
"4.4.2.3 Pragmatic functions
The expectation marker has three important roles in the cohesion of text, all of which
broadly relate to expectancy in a discourse: topicalization (cf. 10.1.2.4), floor-holding (cf.
10.1.2.4), and rhetorical question marking (cf. 10.1.2.1). An example of each role is as
follows:                                             148

"Invariably, monosyllabic linked forms are more commonly used than the
morphologically regular longer forms (i.e., those which are subject to the morphological
template given in 5.2.2.2). When questioned concerning differences in the usage of
respective long and short forms, Mambay speakers cite factors such as formal vs.
informal register, whole vs. part designation, neutral vs. emphatic linking, and
distant/intangible vs. proximal/tangible presence. However, none of these variables have
been consistently borne out by elicited examples, and instances of the longer forms are
altogether absent in the spontaneous text that has been gathered. It is possible that the
longer forms are archaic but legal alternatives for the short forms. An exhaustive list of
nouns with optional monosyllabic linked forms is given here, and has been broken down
based on morphological patterns.",[194]

While Eguchi concentrates on linguistic aspects of Mambay, Hamm’s (2001)
Sociolinguistic survey of the Mambay of Cameroon and Chad provides a complementary
portrayal of the language. Although its stated purpose is to examine possibilities for
language development (p. 2), Hamm’s study offers findings regarding key topics such as
demographics, multilingualism, dialect variation, intelligibility with related varieties,
language attitudes and other related sociolinguistic questions.","[28, 29]"

       nà4kà7rá     cane, coward2.3.3 Interpretive issues
There are number of interpretive issues involving both vowels and consonants. This
topic has major implications for segmental and syllable inventories. These issues
concern the interpretation of y and w in complex onsets (2.3.3.1), pharyngeal
articulations (2.3.3.2), glottalic articulations in syllable rhymes (2.3.3.3), and syllable
rhymes ending in high vowels and semivowels (2.3.3.4).2.3.3.1 y and w in complex onsets
Clements has noted that “it is often hard, in synchronic analysis, to determine whether a
phonetic segment such as [kw] should be analysed phonemically as /ku/, /kw/, or even as
the single segment /kw/” (2000:130). In other words, it is possible that onsets comprised
of a consonant-semivowel sequence be interpreted as CV, CC or C. In Mambay, where
this interpretive question arises, none of the three alternatives is without shortcomings.","[93, 94]"
"4.4.2 The expectation marker m
The expectation marker (here symbolized as m ) is a non-segmental morpheme which
raises the pitch of a phrase-final mora. Although its phonological identity may initially
seem unclear, evidence suggests that like TRS (4.4.1), it is intonational rather than tonal
(4.4.2.2). It has three important roles in the cohesion of text, all of which broadly relate
to expectancy in a discourse: topicalization, the signalling of an incomplete utterance, and
rhetorical question marking (4.4.2.3).",[165]

In some cases, a word or phrase may in itself constitute a complete utterance even though
it does not meet the minimal formal requirements for a clause (i.e., subject plus
predicate). While its significance is bound to the discourse of which is it a part, it is
syntactically independent. Items which typically pattern in this way in Mambay include
interjections, swear words, commands, vocatives and formulae as well as affirmative and
negative markers. The following serve as examples:       háá/)ààháà            ha! aha! you see? (gloating)

In Mambay, clauses are related within a sentence by means of coordination (10.2.1) and
subordination (10.2.2). In the present discussion, a description of clause combinations is
carried out with an emphasis on the morphemes as well as the syntactic structures that
make relations between clauses possible.","[455, 456, 457]"

"The second category of consonants is limited to r. Glottalized syllable rhymes with r
differ from those with other consonants in three ways. First, r is the only non-glottalic
sonorant consonant found in syllable codas that does not have a glottalic counterpart in
the phonology. Second, the phonetic realization of r in a glottalized rhyme is unique.
Unlike other consonants, when glottal closure is employed, it is accompanied by an open
transition consisting of a glottalized echo vowel. It is an open question whether
                                             86
differences in its realization are the product of a contrastive phonological identity or
whether they are a phonetic consequence of its rhotic or periodic (exhibiting repeated
movement) articulation. Third, unlike other consonants in the same position, it is
extremely uncommon; its distribution is restricted to four irregular verbal nouns (see the

Notwithstanding a widespread acceptance of the Kebi-Benue group, the status of
Mambay within this group has been questioned on several occasions. While such
perspectives do not reflect the thrust of the comparative literature in general (1.2.2.3),
they are maintained here as residue since all arguments for Mambay’s position have up to
this point been supported with little data.",[35]

since a process which affects some H tones could affect them all in the same way (i.e.,
non-realization). Still, it is a reasonable conjecture that a floating H might behave
differently than one which is associated (cf. Yip 1989:151). Since no other workable
account has been ascertained, the idea of a floating H tone on the right edge of nánà T
and )ázì T has been maintained throughout the discussion.","[159, 160]"

"1.2.2.2 Position and labelling of Kebi-Benue (“Mbum”/“Adamawa 6”)
The earlier placement of Mambay within the “Mbum” group by Tessman (1932) and
Westermann (1952) is confirmed in Greenberg’s (1963; cf. 1949/55) influential
classification of African languages. Greenberg (1955:11) makes an additional advance,
however, in that he links the Mbum group with higher levels of classification. His (1949)
partition of the Sudanic languages into Niger-Kordofanian (now generally referred to as
Niger-Congo; see Williamson 1989:19) and Nilo-Saharan phyla is well-known. Within
Niger-Kordofanian, one of his innovations is the collection of a number of unclassified
languages and language families, including Mbum, under the label “Adamawa”
(1955:11). Ultimately, he joins the Adamawa languages to a neighbouring family
“Eastern” to constitute the “Adamawa-Eastern” (now Adamawa-Ubangi) branch of
Niger-Congo (1963; cf. Samarin 1971:213, 225). While some sources originally queried
this decision (e.g. Voegelin and Voegelin 1964:38–9), it has gained widespread
acceptance, although it has been defined in recent classifications as a continuum (which
may even include Gur) rather than a monolithic family (Williamson and Blench
2000:18). As regards Mambay’s inclusion among the Adamawa languages, only Caprile
(1977:18, contra 1972:36 and 1977:16) has questioned this assessment. However, he
admits that his skepticism is tentative, and does not defend it.",[32]

The evidence for the complex internal structure of doubly-articulated labial-velar stops
kp gb is weaker, since their relegation to morpheme-initial position (2.1.2.1) limits the
contexts in which they may display internal complexity. However, consider the
following example:
                                           52
       tí4kpâ4kpàr4)áà       wheatear (bird sp.) (cf. )áà bean)This example is ideophonic (5.11, 8.2) and probably shows reduplication (5.11.2) of the
syllable kpar. There are two difficulties with this word. First, it shows a pattern of
segmental reduplication that differs from other patterns in the lexicon, such as those
found in the following comparable words:       lè74lé74gérmù         kingfisher sp. (cf. gérmù women)
       tí4kéé4kèèrú          firefly (cf. kéè brilliant, intense (red))The reduplication of the onset and nucleus of kpar rather than the whole syllable is
surprising, since there are no other examples where this template is applied (reduplication
of whole syllable rhymes is, in contrast, common; see 8.4.2.1). However, the fact that kp
does not occur in non morpheme-initial position elsewhere in the data suggests that there
is indeed a morpheme boundary before both occurrences of kp in tí4kpâ4kpàr4)áà,
attributable to a morphological phenomenon such as reduplication. The question
remains, then, as to why the r of kpar is not reduplicated along with the rest of the
syllable.","[69, 70]"
"Conversely, occurrences of wo and wu are limited. While wo is found only in the word
)òòwó ~ )òwwó ‘yes,’ wu is limited to the morphemes )úùwú and 4 `wú, casual speech
variants of úùrú (3SG.POSS) and 4 `rú (3SG.POSS.INAL; cf. 6.1.4). Words of Fulfulde
origin with the sequence wu are reinterpreted with hu in Mambay; for example, Fulfulde
wuro ‘village’ is pronounced húrò. In addition, the arisal of wo and wu in some
complex morphological contexts results in the alternation of w with h before back vowels
(5.2.2.2.1).",[91]

6.1.3.2 Reflexive object pronouns
Members of a set of reflexive object pronouns are used whenever the object of a simple
clause is co-referential with its subject. Similar to what is found in many other African
languages (Watters 2000:213), reflexive object pronouns in Mambay are composed of the
noun )ínù ‘body, self’ and an inalienable possessive pronoun (6.1.4.2). Reflexive object
pronouns are as follows:                                  Reflexive object pronouns

verb (7.3.2.1.2), reflexive object pronouns satisfy transitivity requirements by supplying
the transitive verb with an object. The detransitivization strategy is only moderately

"8.4.2.1.1 Repetition of segments
Repeated segments are found in almost every adjective with more than one syllable. In
the data, for example, vowels within an adjective are overwhelmingly identical.         óró               deep, far away
       kpírfí              low
       làr àg              flat-nosed

                                            393
Formally, the limitation of adjectives to a single vowel place quality is slightly less strict
(since vowels in the adjective may still be unevenly subject to modifications such as
length and pharyngealization). However, it is found with extreme regularity.       fàhlàm              flat
       gáhlà7              faceted
       gbòòrò              bald, bare
       póh7gó7gó7          narrowThere are only a handful of exceptions to this tendency, as shown by the following items:       gàmzù               long-legged
       gbùhrì              snotty
       kwì’gà              bent-up
       kpé’fú              shallowIn addition to a consistent vowel place quality, coda consonants within an adjective are
usually identical. The overlapping of these two tendencies means that entire syllable
rhymes are, more often than not, repeated. This could alternatively be viewed as
variation of the onset with a constant rhyme.       dòldòl              very hot
       gírgír              rigid
       là7tà7              flexible and bouncy
       vbìgtìg             unsuccessful8.4.2.1.2 Reduplication of syllables
Additionally, the composition of three-syllable adjectives in particular reveals repetition
of entire syllables; this brings to mind reduplication of a greater scope than simple
repetition. In most examples of three-syllable adjectives, the final two syllables are
identical.       rùgùgù              slow
       vbàhtátá            strong and healthy
       wágágá              healthy, cool       (but cf. kpìmsìrì ‘thick, fat’)And for typical two-syllable adjectives—including those for which a derivation (8.5) is
not identifiable—it appears that full reduplication has applied, resulting in adjective
stems composed of a single repeated syllable.       kpó’4kpó’           dry
       lòr4lòr             shiny with baldness
       pyúú4pyúú           pointed, sharp
                                             394
Several derivational processes (8.5) are available to provide evidence as to whether or not
such words are morphologically complex stems derived from a monosyllabic root. One
derivation in particular, that of ideophonic emphasis (8.5.2), is used here to explore this
question. The intensified forms of the two-syllable CVC.CVC and CVV.CVV adjectives
are as follows:       kpí4kpó’           very dry
       lì4lòr             very shiny with baldness
       pí4pyúú            very pointed, very sharpIn these forms, only one of the two syllables is used as a source for the derivation.
However, when three-syllable adjectives undergo the same derivation, all segmental
information is preserved:                          base form          emphatic form (‘very …’)       slow               rùgùgù             ríì4rúgúgú
       strong, healthy    vbàhtátá           vbíì4vbáhtátá
       healthy, cool      wágágá             wíì4wágágáFurther specifications are needed to accurately delineate these patterns. First, the two-
syllable adjective à à ‘shy,’ which is of an uncommon CV.CV shape, is exceptional in
that its emphatic form íì4 á á does not pattern with the typical two-syllable adjectives
above, but with other adjectives, whose segmental information is copied in its entirety.
Second, the single attested four-syllable adjective kírí4kìrì ‘spherical’ does not have a
derived emphatic form; this makes the determination of its morphological composition
problematic. However, since adjectives and ideophonic adverbs undergo some of the
same derivational processes, it is possible to argue that the derivation of an ideophonic
adverb of the same shape (see 8.5.4.2 in particular) provides evidence for a
morphological complexity similar to that of typical two-syllable adjectives.       tégú4tègù          with head and chin sticking out
       tégú tègù tégú     back and forth, with head and chin sticking outIn sum, the data presented here suggest that typical two-syllable adjective stems with
identical reduplicated syllables (CVC.CVC and CVV.CVV) are morphologically
complex. In contrast, other stems in which the last two syllables are identical appear to
be morphologically simple stems whose repetition is a function of their ideophonic
identity rather than a morphological process.","[410, 411, 412]"

Five of the six basic inflectional categories (7.4) have corresponding negative forms
(7.5.1). The segmental and tonal form of a verb word remains constant when it is
negated. Verbal negation is instead marked by negative particles (7.5.2), and with
Indicative verb forms, by negative subject pronouns (7.5.3). A summary of negative
verbal forms is provided in 7.5.4.","[373, 374]"
"7.5.3 Negative subject pronouns
In addition to being marked by negative particles (7.5.2), verbal negation is marked on
Indicative subject pronouns (6.1.2). Negative Indicative pronouns exhibit the CVV shape
which distinguishes Irrealis verb forms, but their tonal value varies: negative Perfective
verb forms are LH, and negative non-Perfective (negated Imperfective and Future) forms
are HL.",[375]

"5.5.2.2 Irregular plurals
Ten of the nouns in the data, most of which are commonly used vocabulary items,
employ alternative pluralization strategies. For eight of the ten words, the irregular plural
exists alongside a typical plural form; however, the irregular forms are more commonly
used.",[230]
"An alternative presentation of the same system using the more familiar distinctions of
inclusive vs. exclusive and singular vs. dual vs. plural has also been considered. In such
a presentation, the 1&2 singular slot shown above would be labelled “first person
inclusive dual” and the 1&2 plural slot would be labelled “first person inclusive plural”;
also—and importantly—the first person plural slot described in this study would be recast
as “first person exclusive plural.” Such a description is provided for a parallel system in
Margi (a Chadic language of Nigeria) by Hoffman (1963:72ff.). The two presentations
may be compared as follows:    Presentation with 1&2SG/PL slots               Presentation using familiar distinctions                                                                       1DU.INCL 1PL.INCL

The latter presentation, which relies on more familiar distinctions, falls short in that it sets
up a dual vs. plural opposition, even though a “dual” category is not grammaticalized
elsewhere in the Mambay pronoun system (or anywhere in the language, for that matter;
see Thomas 1955:205, Plank 1996 and Cysouw 2003:87–8). In contrast, the presentation
with 1&2SG/PL slots recognizes a communication dyad as a basic person category; as
such, it brings out symmetry in the applicability of plurality to 1&2 person pronouns and
inherently singular pronouns (Greenberg 1988:3–4). The semantic confusion that arises
from the labelling of a “you-and-I” (i.e., 1&2SG) pronoun as singular can be addressed by
considering this pronoun, along with the inherently singular pronouns, as “minimal”;
remaining pronouns could be considered “augmented,” since they all involve the addition
of “other” persons to “minimal” slots (Bohnhoff 1986:104, Beavon 1986:175, Corbett
2000:199–9, Cysouw 2003:85–90, 2005:5).",[276]

7.6 Expansions of verbal inflection
Expanded verb forms allow for functional enrichment of the categories in the basic
inflectional system. While some are formed by means of TAM indicators (7.6.1), others
are formed using possessive constructions (7.6.2) and complex inflectional constructions,
including serial and auxiliary verb constructions (7.6.3).",[377]
